Edison Blue Amberol
«v
Records for March
That the list should be headed by a selection of Harry
Lauder is quite as it should be. This delightful enter-
tainer. who has given such joy to countless thousands
through the Edison Records, and whose gigantic self-
sacrificing war-work will be ever remembered by “our
boys,” is about to make his second visit to Australia.
Hear him at his best in “Good-bye Till We Meet Again.”
At this season the number by the Metropolitan Quartet.
“All Hail the Power of Jesus’ Name,” will be doubly
acceptable—the rendition is a fine one.
There are several ballads which will find their way into
many hearts —“Dear Old-fashioned Songs Mv Mother
Sang to Me,” sung by George McFadden ; “Underneath
the Stars,” Walter Van Brunt; and “I Called You My
Sweetheart,”' by George Wilton Ballard, being real gems.
“That Creepy, Weepy Feeling,” a specialty for mixed
voices, is a great feature as sung by the quartet: Gladys
Rice, Marion Evelyn Cox, George Wilton Ballard and
Harvey Hindermeyer. .
.These are but a few picked at random, but others there are—band
dance music, xylophone, saxophone and the rest—the whole comprising a
splendid program—quite up to the usual Edison standard.

The Red Page
The Boulevard St. Michel
Arthur Symons’s latest book, Color
Studies in Paris (Chapman arid Hall), takes
the form of critical reminiscences rathei
than of literary studies. He leads us to
the Latin Quarter. We find the place seeth-
ing with youth. In the Boulevard Saint-
Michel we may meet liemy de Gourmont,
Marcel Schwob, Pierre Louys or any other
of the men who are turning French poetry
upside down (Verlaine actually did turn
the sonnet upside dowri), breaking classical
rules, forging poems and prose, painting pic-
tures or scoring operas; all in their quest
for beauty. In London —
But there never will be a Boul’ Mich’ in London.
The Boul’ Mich’ is simply the effervescence' of irre-
pressible youth; and youth in London never effer-
vesces, or only in one man here, in one woman
there. The stern British moralist tells us that it is
Indeed fortunate that we have not a Boulevard Saint-
Michel in our midst; that we have not, and nevdr
can have, a d’Harcourt; and he points to the vice
which flaunts there. No doubt whatever vice is
to be found in the Quartier' does very much flaunt
itself. But is it really more vicious, in a certain
sense, than the corresponding- thing in London which
takes itself so seriously as well as cautiously, is so
self-convinced of evil-doing; and has all the un-
healthy excitement of an impotent but persistent
Puritan conscience ?
The little coterie of Frenchmen that form
the substance of these “color studies” flutter
round the Parnassian and Symbolist schools
of the later nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. The former school, commenced
in France as a reaction against the perfervid
sentimentality and exaggeration of the
Romantics. The Parnassian school was
succeeded somewhere about ISBS by the
Decadents or Symbolists, who have breathed
a new life into French verse by the fusing
of music with poetry, and enlarging—and
in many cases discarding altogether—Hie
pedantic rules of metrical expression. Ste-
phane Mallarm6 and Claude Debussy stand
pre-eminently at the head of this modern
art, the one for poetry, the other for music.
Probably no Englishman has so thor-
oughly understood Paris and known so many
of its literary men as Arthur Symons. He
talks about them all ; —Catulle Mendcs. Rene
Ghil, Emile Verhaeren, Henri de Regnier,
Remy de Gourmont, Paul Verlaine and a
score of others. He gives much space to
the rehabilitation of Verlaine, playing- the
r6le of devoted admirer. Jules Lemaitre,
a- contemporary Academician, wrote of Ver-
laine : “I imagine he must be almost illite-
rate. He has a strange head—the profile
of Socrates, an enormous forehead, a skull
knobbed like a battered basin of thin cop-
per. He is not civilised; he ignores all
received codes of morality.” He paid the
usual price of iconoclasm. During his life
his fame penetrated only into certain small
cliques ; beyond that there existed but vague,
scandal. But posthumous fame is coming
to him. Symons declares that his verse is
“as lyrical as Shelley’s, as fluid, as magical
—though the magic is a new one. It is a
twilight art full of reticence, of perfumed
shadows, of hushed melodies.”
Wit
As dramatic ideas evolved from the per-
ception of wide, regular contrasts like black
and white, evil and good, and are graded by
higher perception to shades of color and
character, so crude humor, or the percep-
tion of irregular contrasts, was born of
obscenity and buffoonery. An irregular con-
trast is’ illustrated by a fat man chasing his
blown-off hat. The irregular is the unusual
pace of the fat man; seeing a child chase a
hat we are less amused, for running is
natural to a child.
Critically examined, every joke is based on
irregular contrasts, though with increasing
delicacy in the humor the contrast is harder
to perceive. Our developing taste is re-
strained to the less and less extravagant,
what once’ greatly delighted us seeming crude,
even noxious. This evolution is notable in
peoples. Many aboriginals, including our
own, find merriment in obscenity; the yokel
in broad jests; the educated in Regular
ideas. In literature the line of advance is
plain. The jokes of Rabelais that convulsed
a continent would now be relegated to the
sewer. First, obscenity, then buffoonery,
puns, exaggeration, true description, irony,
sarcasm, and, lastly, contrasts so slight that
only a keen mind perceives them.
In ourselves there is the same pro-
gress more or less. As children we
delight in buffoonery, the rough and
tumble of Punch and Judy, the clown
in pantomime or circus. From this it
is only a step to the crudities —and the most-
appreciated fooling—of Charlie Chaplin.
Mark Twain is a milestone left behind when
we appreciate O. Henry, Crane and Gilbert.
Of the grades of wit there are survivals —
obscenity in the jokes of the uneducated ; in-
decency in club-room stories; exaggeration in
the cartoonist and the Yankee machine-made
joke. And this is notable: the oldest and
crudest jests ai*e the most popular, because
the crowd-mind in this perception is infan-
tile, as demonstrated by the vast sale of the
alleged Comic Cuts papers and the colored
supplements to the Yankee press. London
Punch wisely refused Gilbert’s MS.; his wit
might have ruined its circulation.
But as with music, so with humor; neither
its possession nor the lack of it is a guide to
mental ability in other directions. Poe,
Emerson. Macaulay, Zola. Maupassant,
Napoleon, Gladstone and Bright —not a smile
comes from all they wrote or uttered. Few
minds develop equally all round, great excel-
lence in one direction often leaving barren-
ness in others; and while the most brilliant
flowers find their nourishment in excrement,
so the most brilliant wit has its origin in
obscenity.
BIOLOGIST.
The German Spy
A maddening rush of Hun spy fiction has
accompanied the war. It is, in the main,
very low-class and calculated to depreciate
the intellect. The spy is clumsy, obvious.
heavy-handed and large-footed. He becomes
apparent at the very beginning by his Ger-
man accent and his military stalk and his
well-drilled attitudes. When he rises from
hi-3 chair he rises in one piece, and when he
bows he bows in two pieces, one above the
waist and one below, connected by a hinge.
The aggressive voice used for shouting at
troops issues from his mouth, and his eye
is the eye of one who has speni> his life
glaring at his inferiors. Also his boots are
the kind that recruits are kicked with. All
his incriminating documents are dragged
behind him at the end of a string. In his
pocket, in order to refresh his memory, is
the address of the secret haunt where the
rest of the evidence and all the accomplices
can be found. His favorite disguise is that
of a homicidal maniac or a plague patient.
In another walk of life he would advertise
himself “Franz Schmidt, Highest Price
Given for Stolen Property.” In the very
last chapter he is overtaken by 10 detectives
only a gleam mope intelligent than himself.
The fact’ is that born spies are rare, and
heaven-born detectives are scarce, and only
the man who is both of them can invent
them. Any dwarf author can invent a tall
hero, for he, has simply to say he is tall
without showing how he became so. But it
isn’t sufficient to say that the secret agent
is a marvel of dexterity who can steal the
boots off a walking man without his know-
ledge, and that the ’tec is a bloodhound who
sniffs conspiracy a mile off and takes some
of the smell home in a bottle for analysis.
They have to be shown doing these things,
which means that —the author, provided he
invents his story and doesn’t steal it, mpst
be able to do them. No man can invent a
better sleuth than himself.
For the saving of the reader’s intellect
writers of detective stories should be
licensed like motor-car drivers. Each one
should be allotted a hardened criminal, and
if he doesn’t spy out anything important
about him beyond what is in the papers he
should be disqualified. The world might
then have fewer shilling shocks, but the
quality would improve.
Local Color
There is a careless habit that calls every-
thing Australian that is produced in Aus-
tralia. It may be right enough in regard
to industry and commerce ; it isn’t always
right in application to local politicians and
it is absolutely wrong in respect to litera-
ture and the drama.
A mere cataloguing of gum-trees and emus
is not local color, nor does a lavish sprinkling
of such scenery make a book truly Austra-
lian. This is clearly seen when an alleged
Australian play is staged. The scenery is
often faithfully painted, but it is entirely
apart from the tone and atmosphere of the
play itself. _ Any experienced reader can
tell an American book of .the front rank from
an English book upon the first dip into, its
pages, yet throughout there may be no men-,
tion of the fauna and flora of the land. The
atmosphere, an iitsight into the national
character, the graphic picture of the home
life, distinguishes one from the other. An
Englishman travels through Canada and
writes of it, but in reading him you know
that you are merely skimming over the sur-
face with him. He is introducing you to
a body without a soul. The Canadian car-
ries you with him into the charm of that
inner life which must be absorbed by long
association before it will ooze from the point
of the pen to give the true feeling to a book.
Life in < Australia, especially life in the
country, is different from the Canadian’s,
from the American’s (though it approaches
that nearer than any) and from the Eng-
lish; and our _ literature to be truly Austra-
lian must be imbued with the spirit of our
home life. And that emanates with diffi-
culty from anyone who has spent his child-
hood in another land.
E. S. SORENSON.
Synge's Beloved Aran
I spent September in Synge’s “beloved
Aran.” I was the only non-Irish visitor
to the Islands on that trip of the Dun
Aengus, and it had been my intention to
stay just-that day; but the fascination of
the place proved too much, and, although I
came luggageless, the fact that I was a
woman and was from Australia brought
forth all necessaries except a toothbrush,
which I found it impossible to buy.
In Inishmore English is creeping in,
although outside a three-mile radius of Kil-
ronan, > the principal village, many of the
islanders have no English. Pampooties are
still worn; though here again outside influ-
ence is at work, and the merits of hobnailed
boots are not scorned. But Inishmaan and
Inishere still cling to their picturesque foot-
gear.
What struck me about the people—and
this I had not gathered from Synge or other
writers on the islands—was their comfort.
Dependent, of course, on the mainland for
many commodities, the people manage
nevertheless to get out of the scanty patches
of soil a quite decent living. How they do
it is a marvel to an Australian, accustomed
to prodigality in farming; but wherever
there is a bit of a field in the prevailing
limestone, it is used up to the limit. The
soil is loose as sea sand, and is manured
with seaweed. Aran potatoes get top prices
in the Galway market, an 9 pigs and sheep
fattened here are not beaten in all Ireland.
Owing to the shortage of iodine hillocks
of red seaweed are dotted along the grey
beaches, in due time to be burnt off and the
product sent to Scotland; there is no iodine
factory in Ireland. Fishing has also re-
ceived a fillip, and twice a week hundreds
of boxes are despatched. One islander made
this year £lBO in six weeks out of mackerel
alone. Turf is imported, mainly from Con-
nemara, and firing is the chief expense of
the people.
Very like in feature, build and stride are
the Aran men and Australians. (We did
not know that we were such a race apart
until we came abroad in bulk.) The keen-
ness of the people to learn news of the out-
side world is most marked. They knew
more about Australian politics than I did
and any literature that comes their way

Trysting.
They dug his grave in France,
But* his bones are all that keep in it;
He heard a coachwhip calling
In the sheoaks by the bend ;
They dug it deep and wide enough—
There’s half his section sleep in it.
The night wind crooned above him,
And it called him like a friend.
They laid him down to sleep,
But lie could not take the rest of it;
He heard the stubble crackle
And he smelt the drift of smoke.
Oh, harvest-tide and ploughing-time,
He had to taste the best of it,
And sweet the strength of toil is
When you’ve learned to love the yoke!
They dug his grave in France,
But Death could not keep a hold of him
His youth was ripe for mating
And its joys were sweet to miss;
And all that’s leal to love in him.
Aye, all that’s best and bold of him,
Is waiting at the sliprails
For a lass he used to kiss.

The grey church on her buttressed flanks
Dreams in the sun and holds her tower
High to the blue, while from the banks
Of Autumn leaves the children shower
The wind’s gold mintage on her walls
And wake awed echoes from her side.
Far o’er the town the shadow falls.
So has she dreamed, while those who playet
Within her shadow loved and sighed,
Wept at her altars, passed, and died.

Day’s End.
Fiery as vintage the still skies burn,
In gold to the east the long lights yearn;
From tall tree shadows the mopoke calls,
And the haggard bush to her dreaming falls,
In her brave bride-green, with a note of
grey,
At the rose-red end of a quiet day.
The broadaxe lies on the bloodwood stump,
And the team-bells clink in the ti-tree clump,
Till the wide west pearls, like a wild rose-
leaf,
Or a moonlit sea on a mile of reef,
As my pipe glows red, where the dark leaves
blend,
With the slow still thoughts of the dim day-
end.
And when my day burns to its waiting west,
May one boon be mine, for I hold it best:
Just this, at the sweet of dusk to sit,
Where the jewelled night-moths weave and
flit,
Where, as now, from my coign I may just
define
One small clear star in the passion-vine.
For the wsoder-ways are long and long—•
Roads of silence and roads of song;
Rough scrub tracks, and the city street —
But the byway kindest for tired feet
Is a garden-path, where night moths play,
At the silent end of a singing day.

A Rainbow-riot in a Garden.
In a garden there’s a spot to feast one’s
gazing,
Wherein Nature’s colors, riotous, have bled;
Cannas lift their goblet beads of yellow,
blazing
To flame and vivid orange hue and red;
And the salvia, with arrogance amazing,
Flouts her own against her taller sister’s
head.
Phlox, in pink and white confusion, star-
crammed clusters
Swaying down some shy lobelia to seek,
And a fairy rambler rose, whose pink glow
flusters •
Each petal, as a blush a maiden’s cheek,
Join the glory, while the wind in playful
blusters
Shakes the grass-seeds in a mood of sport-
ful freak.
In this garden must be elfin things abiding,
Leading measures o’er the shaven lawns
unseen ;
Fairy townlets on the pansy beds in hiding,
Airy summer-seats ’mid boughs of shiny
green—
Games unknown of us; a trick of sunbeam
sliding,
Or a frolic with a democratic queen.
But in my color plot of rainbow tinting,
Where the riot reigns supreme, there comes
no fay,
For never sunbeam to its depth goes glint-
ing,
To tempt the gauzy-winged to fairy-play;
But goblin laughter, through thick growths,
comes hinting
Of eerie gnome-life hid from light of day.
Heigh-ho and what care I for elfin dancing,
Or grinning gnome, when I may drink mv
share
Of beauty from one tropic spot entrancing,
And store up in my soul a treasure rare
Of warmth, that in chill winter shall come
glancing—•
A glowing memory of hours more fair!

THE FARCE OF BOLSHING IN
AUSTRALIA.
Bolshevism, like many other calamities,
meant well when it started. It could have origi-
nated in no other country than Russia. The
moujik is, in most cases, not merely a pro-
fessing Christian; he is a Believer of the
genuine pre-Renaissance brand. He had
never been cultivated up to the point of
hating automatically all those against whom
his National Government happened to declare
war, being in this respect the antithesis
of the intensively-educated German. Before
Russia defected, the moujiks were obeying
the Scriptural injunction on the ques-
tion of enemy-treatment so faithfully that
German prisoners were living with them as
friends. Anyone can live with the average
Russian moujik as a friend, provided he is
able to endure the smell and the starvation
diet and is willing to do his share of
work about the family hovel. This class
of Russian is from three to four centuries
out of date. He believes in a literal prac-
tice of Christian precepts. He is no mere
State or Fabian Socialist, but the real thing
—a communist or property-sharer. And
many leaders of thought in the vast ana-
chronism which is Russia hold the same
views. They know all about European
ideals. But they consider them rotten.
Their ideal is a nation built on the brother-
hood-of-man rock (or quicksand, as the case
may be), and they want uo other sort.
When the Russian .Empire fell and the
business of organising Communism started,
the reformers were faced with the obstacle
-which always has met such people since
the property-instinct was first conceived.
Many of the dispossessed showed fight.
Their attention was drawn to the Bible.
They * remained obdurate. They were
slaughtered for their souls’ sake and the
good of the nation. Slaughter breeds
slaughter; and, worse, it attracts those
who love blood for its own sake. The re-
ports from Russia are necessarily vague, and
inaccurate. But, on all the evidence, the
position appears to be that over large tracts
of country the people are peacefully living
a more or less communistic life. They are
doing it (1) because their peculiar men-
tal and spiritual undevelopment makes it
possible, and (2) because those who dis-
approve of Communism are unable to get
at them. Many of those who disapprove are
dead. So, almost, is transport. The rail-
way system, never good off the main lines,
has been devastated by war and revolution ;
and towage on the highly-developed inland
waterways has broken down for lack of
organised labor. The transport trouble
cuts both ways. It prevents the arrival of
food as well as an invasion by supporters
of reactionary Westernism, and so the
Socialists are starving. Elsewhere in Rus-
sia—in the great eities and industrial
centres —there is no doubt that government
by murder and outrage is the rule. On the
whole, then, Bolshevism has been a sensa-
tionally dreadful curse even to the place
that should be its spiritual home.
* * * "
As a working policy for a country like
Australia nothing could be more curiously
out of place. The Russian toiler’s aim is
Socialism without a State, for the State
has been guilty of centuries of infamies.
But the State has done nothing to the Aus-
tralian worker —beyond providing him with
a number of concessions at the expense of
the rest of the community, and the means
to obtain more. Again, the Russian is a
religious idealist. Having been barred from
politics he gave his attention to spiritual
matters, and became a mystic. There is
no mysticism about the Australian. Well-
fed, carefully educated, physically and men-
tally vigorous, a born politician, he is, in
the ’mass, the . world’s “man of the world.”
To this type the beachcomber’s existence,
which to 90 per cent, of Russians represents
an earthly paradise, would be misery. The
Australian is not after a flat rate of hap-
piness. He knows that the wo fid offers
much to all who have the will and brains
to take it, and he believes he has these pos-
sessions. Many unscrupulous Australians,
mostly imported, would favor the Russian
system of forcibly expropriating the pro-
perty of the rich. But there is a pretty
general appreciation of the fact that the
thing is too wasteful to *be worth while.
Mr. Hordern’s yacht, without Mr. Hor-
dern’s income to keep it in commission,
would become a useless mass of iron.
Broadly, the citizens here who favor ex-
propriation on the Russian plan, are those
who have nothing, and do not intend to
work hard enough to ever get anything.
The many oppose it if only because they
either have or intend to have property of
their own. And they look confidently to
the State to give them what it never gave
the Russians of their class —security in
their homes, security to work, and security
to hold the fruits of their work.
* * * *
For such reasons there is little likelihood
of Bolshevism proper getting a footing in
Australia. But there is plenty of scope for
that, sort of lawlessness which, in all its
manifestations, is nowadays called Bolshev-
ism. Food may not be short, as it is in
parts of Russia, but it is criminally dear.
So are many other necessaries. The worker
knows that there is a swindle- in progress
somewhere—that someone is making gro-
tesquely large profits at his expense. He
is filled with anger, the sort of impotent
anger that makes a man want to break
things. There is a housing problem in
every big city, and a land boom in most
of them. Thousands are living under slum-
conditions, and there is no surer breeder
of anarchy than debased housing. People
who are denied such things as cleanliness,
air space and beauty tend to get their own
back from society by revolt where they can.
The normal element of disorder is aug-
mented by the world-wide uneasiness of
demobilisation. Australia contains a num-
ber of Germans and other aliens. They call
themselves “Bolsheviks.” meaning that they
are against the State. There is a Sinn
Fein element, and its sympathies are “Bol-
shevist” —if the term means hostility to
Britain. There is a class which is irri-
tated by the spectacle of returned soldiers.
Members of it take offence easily, and are
quick to provide proof that it was not
lack of physical courage which kept them
at home. All these persons lean, sometimes
openly, sometimes lialf-unconsciously, in
the direction of sporadic anarchy. They
are always ready for a row, such as
occurred the other day in Brisbane; and
many soldiers, embittered by departmental
stupidity and by a suspicion that certain
undesirables are pampered chiefly because
they are undesirables, are in the mood to
supply rows. That is the Bolshevism that
Australia has at present. With reasonably
honest and intelligent government it is all it
should ever have.
SHOULD A DOCTOR BE HANGED
NOW AND THEN?
A medical view of the problem:—
“0.L.” (B. 20/3/’l9) thinks that an independent
inquiry should be made into every death with a view
to finding out whether the deceased became so
through fault of the doctor or nurse. He says that
ship captains have to stand an inquiry when they
lose their charges. But “0.L.” surely knows that
navigation is an exact science, whereas medicine
doesn’t pretend to be anything of the kind; there-
fore the rules and regulations which have been found
by experience to be excellent to secure the safety of
ships could not possibly hold good when applied to
safeguarding human lives from “errors” of doctors.
In the case of an error of judgment, or culpable
negligence, on the part of a ship’s captain, whereby
his vessel had been damaged or lost, the Magine
Court would have to deal with cold facts; it would
have to do with unalterable laws and inanimate
things. The age of the official engaged on the
inquiry wouldn’t matter at all; in fact, the opinion
of an octogenarian shellback might be of more value
in deciding the amount of blame attachable to the
offending skipper than, say, an official of 50. But
one would never think of putting an octogenarian on
a medical tribunal. A medical board of inquiry
would have to deal with opinions instead of facts,
and with the material of the human body, which is
extremely variable in nature and quality. In a
given malady of equal intensity, one patient might
pull through, and another one of the same age
succumb—-a state of things due to the difference in
resisting power possessed by individual sufferers.
There would remain, then, for deliberation by the
tribunal those cases only in which it could be posi-
tively demonstrated, by post-mortem finding, that an
operation would have saved the patient’s life. These
happenings would be few and far between, for both
the medical ignoramus and the dipsomaniac usually
have enough gumption to hand such cases over to a
competent surgeon.
“0.L.” is on surer ground when he tackles the
medical dipsomaniac and the surgically-unclean prac-
titioner. These gentry, unfortunately becoming more
and more common in our midst, are undoubtedly a
menace and a curse to the country; and every effort
should be made to prevent them obtaining a certifi-
cate from the Medical Board of the State to which
they have flown as to an Ammon’s Temple in the
Libyan waste. Such a one is usually a remittance-
man, whose relations have been mightily anxious to
gee rid of him for good; and having formed the
opinion that Australia is the finest dumping-ground
in the world for such medical refuse, he is furnished
with funds, passes the Medical Board and settles
down to practise in our midst, in town or in the
country, incidentally unsettling every other practi-
tioner within 100 miles by his abominable disregard
or all known medical and surgical laws and prin-
ciples.
Our longevity depends mostly on the kind of
tubing- that was used in the construction of our
arterial system ; hence the commonly-used expression,
“We live as long as our arteries.” It may have been
bad tubing from the start, or may have become so
by overfeeding, overdrinking, overworking, or as the
result of infectious diseases. Too many valuable
lives under 50 yvars of age are lost from arterial
degeneration, which in most cases is preventable, but
not by medicines or the visits of a doctor. A “go-
slow” policy with regard to the output of human
energy would be of more use to the individual than
all the doctors and medicine in the universe. With
an inside knowledge of the utter futility of any form
of curative treatment in most chronic maladies,
especially of the arterial system, a medical tribunal
would be very chary in recording a verdict of
neglectful treatment against the medical attendant in
a purely medical case. Surgery opens up a wider
field for a tribunal’s activities, but it would have to
be composed exclusively of high-class surgeons, and
even then there would be room for a difference of
opinion, which might permit the culprit to escape
scot-free. Very few physicians have much faith in
drugs or stimulants. The best practitioner is the
one who has the smallest therapeutical armament-
arium ; and in hospital practice stimulants have
been practically abandoned altogether. Therefore at
an inquiry the question of neglect in the adminis-
tration of drugs or stimulants would be passed out
at the commencement of the trial.
Any doubtful British or foreign practitioner seek-
ing registration on Australian shores should be com-
pelled to give an account of his professional peram-
bulations and peregrinations, from the day of gradu-
ation up to the date of his arrival in the State. No
candidate should be registered even temporarily
unless he could produce evidence of at last five years’
medical study previous to qualifying at a recognised
university or licensing college. A stiff examination
held in the various States as a preliminary to regis-
tration would adt as a deterrent to all objectionable
gentry. A better plan would be to scrap the present
Medical Board’s rules and regulations: they are out
of date. A medico from overseas should be obliged
to produce, in addition to his degree or diploma,
evidences of good character, the number of places
practised in before coming to Australia,, and the
length of his sojourn in each town, along with any
medical appointments, hospital or otherwise, previ-
ously held, before being granted a temporary certifi-
cate from the Medical Board. The only question at
present asked by the chairman of the Board, at the
registration ceremony, which is over in two minutes,
is: “Where -did you get this diploma?” or degree, as
the case may be. The candidate replies that it was
given to him at such-and-such university or college,
and as the diploma looks all right a certificate of
registration is signed by the members of the Board,
and the parchment immediately handed over. In the
interest of the general public, and for the safeguard-
ing of the lives .of the citizens, this fossilised proce-
dure should be scrapped at once. In the first in-
stance, a certificate should be issued permitting the
aspirant for registration to practise for six or 12
months on probation. If anything suspicious in the
candidate’s professional conduct were reported by his
fellow-practitioners during the period of probation, a
medical tribunal, after full inquiry into the matter,
might deem it its, duty to regard such a person as
an “undesirable” and refuse to register him perma-
nently. Should the medico’s conduct be irreproach-
able he would get his permanent registration certifi-
cate at the end of the probationary period. That
would be a practical way of dealing with a difficult
subject. Once these gentry are registered nothing
can be done with them. Alcohol is a slow killer, and
in some cases seems to preserve them.
The ever-increasing list of huge blacklisted dis-
pensaries is responsible for the augmentation in
number of medical undesirables. These men are
attracted, as moths to a lamp, by the glitter of the
easily-earned £lOOO per annum so obtrusively and
temptingly advertised ever since the disastrous
failure of the Vic. branch of the B.M.A. to come to
satisfactory terms with the militant lodges. These
appointments being taboo to B.M.A. men, the lodge
officials are at their wits’-end to fill the vacancies.
Dispensary committees, which in the old days were
savagely dictatorial in the treatment of their medical
men, have been compelled by force of circumstances
to climb down from their high horse and to eat
humble pie. They have, perforce, to be content with
any old medical material they can scrape together, a
fact that speaks volumes for the efficiency of the
B.M.A. “blockade.” It was not an unusual thing in
the ancient days for a rising young doctor, proceed-
ing on foot to his thankless task at some Oddfellows’
Temple, to be bailed up and accosted peremptorily
by a M.U. or G.U.0.0.F. official and told to look
lively and get to business, or he would give him
what-for at next lodge meeting for being 10 minutes
late. I have known a Deputy Grand of the United
Brothers, or something such, who happened to be
driving a municipal watering-cart, pull his old
quadruped up with a jerk, leap off and rush across
the road for the sole purpose of ragging his lodge
doctor for unpunctuality. Thank Heaven those days
are over!
Until the public wakes up from its long sleep in
matters affecting its health and uses its head in an
endeavor to discriminate between the honest, brainy
practitioner and the medical charlatan with the
smooth tongue and love of strong waters, the present
unsatisfactory conditions will continue. The busi-
ness-man who is engaged all day long in poring over
ponderous ledgers, and who has no time to consider
the health of himself or family, has only himself to
blame if his selected medical attendant is not of A 1
quality and tuned up to concert-pitch. He is usually
easily deceived by a subservient manner; and, when
Dr. Blank agrees with every word he utters, Dr.
Blank becomes a fixture in the household, as firm and
solid as the foundations of the dwelling itself. The
cute business-man may, by a stroke of luck, drop
across a physician who has imbibed the new medical
ideas from a modern Fons Bandusiae, but more fre-
quently he gets hold of one who has assuaged his not
very obtrusive thirst for medical knowledge at the
town pump, or city drinking-fountain, sacred to the
parched throats of the great unwashed.
THE ONE BIG SLAUGHTER.
The conference which met at Melbourne
Trades Hall recently to organise the One Big
Union commenced by defining that body as
an organisation for killing an unknown
number of people. The definition was made
as mildly and as politely as circumlocution
allowed, but the fact was conspicuous enough.
“Long experience,” it appears, “has proved
the hopeless futility of existing political and
industrial methods.” So political methods
of obtaining redress for whatever grievances
there may be are to be abandoned. And poli-
tical methods in Australia consist in govern-
ment by a supreme Parliament chosen by the
equal vote of every man and woman who
isn’t an alien, a lunatic or a criminal, and by
six Assemblies very similarly constituted.
In place of this there is to be “revolutionary
action to secure a complete change, namely
the abolition of capitalistic ownership of the
means of production whether privately or
through the State and the establishment in
its place of social ownership by the whole
community.” Revolutions of any sort which
are accomplished without bloodshed are so
few that they can almost be counted on the
fingers. As for bloodless revolutions which
include the confiscation or transfer of almost
every kind of property, including State pro-
perty which belongs to the whole community
(so far as it doesn’t belong to the,commu-
nity’s creditors), they are impossible. There
is bound to be resistance, and resistance can
only be put down by killing, otherwise the
revolutionists might be killed themselves.
And bloodshed leads to anger, which leads to
more bloodshed. The great element of suc-
cessful revolution is suddenness, and that
leaves little time for explanation or argument.
The men who come to take charge of “the
means of production” as the self-appointed
trustees of the people—for the whole people
can’t come in a body to take over every little
means of production down to the sewing-
machine in a small factory—haven’t time to
show their credentials to everybody, and
might not be welcomed even if they
did. They must insist on being taken
on trust, and they and their follow-
ers have to shoot those who won’t
trust. It isn’t sufficient to stun them,
for they might revive and attack the trustees
in the rear. Of course the first necessity is
to put the mechanism of government—the
mechanism which exists to prevent revolu-
tions, among other things—out of gear.
There is necessarily an interval, which is apt
to be *a long one in a big country like Aus-
tralia or Russia, between the crippling of the
old device and the complete establishment of
the new one. That is a time when every
strong hoodlum, criminal, fanatic, madman-
at-large and person with a private grievance
is pretty much a law to himself, and when
any desirable girl or woman is liable to be
anybody’s property. These things are regret-
table, but nobody has found a way to prevent
them. The leaders of the One Big Killing
must either fail in their programme or have
a lot of blood on their hands and a lot of
human entrails on their boots.
* * * *
Whether the killing of people is wrong or
not is a theological point that need not be
discussed. Everybody has to die some day.
There are more people with the lust for slay-
ing than is commonly supposed. Usually
they don’t know that they have it till they are
started. If a revolution opened by a general
slaughter in the gaols, hospitals, lunatic-
asylums and old people’s homes it would at
least get rid, in the general confusion, of some
undesirable folk and a great many unpro-
ductive ones. Unfortunately the biggest
butchery is always among the able-bodied, the
money-earners, the mothers and fathers or
prospective mothers and fathers. They get
mixed up in the attack and defence, while
the proved lunatics and the hospital patients
don’t. This is likely to be especially the
case in Australia, for in this country the re-
volution will be more gory than the average.
It won’t be a case of pushing down an effete
king like Manoel of Portugal, for there is
no king within reach. Nor will it be a
matter of oversetting a proud and worn-out
but scarce nobility, for the whole of Aus-
tralia’s hereditary peerage recently died at
sea, and in any case he wasn’t hereditary,
being childless, and he had only begun to be
a peer. It is to be a movement against the
whole class which owns “the means of pro-
duction,” which are land, machinery, money
and, incidentally, brains. The landowners
are a large class and an increasing one. The
steady diminution of the returns from the
Federal graduated land-tax shows that the
impost is doing the work it was intended for
and cutting the big freeholds into small ones
that are below T the dutiable level. The in-
crease of the tax in 1914-15 brought the fad-
ing income up to £2.210,742; by 1917-18 the
breakage of the big holdings among a number
of small people reduced it to £1,663,097. The
machinery-owners— i.e., owners of factories
as apart from owners of ploughs and har-
rows—represented at last return 15,010 indi-
viduals or firms or companies, which is a con-
siderable army. They turn out on an average
£6OOO worth of work annually apiece, most
of this being absorbed in wages, rent, taxes,
fuel-, light, depreciation, bad debts and mixed
expenses, so they are not in a very large way.
Owners of money, as distinguished from fixed
property, movable property and machinery,
are numerous, but hardly worth plundering.
All the real money in Australia, apart from
the people’s own promises to pay themselves,
which are no good to them if they stop pay-
ing themselves, would only cover the com-
munity’s living expenses for a month. These
people, all put together, will put up a hefty
fight, even though some of them may combine
to plunder the rest, when the representatives
of the One Big Killing come to take posses-
sion in the name of the people.
* * * *
Of course the abolition of “capitalistic
ownership of the means of production....
through the State” means something more
than the ejection, with or without violence,
of the present management and the installa-
tion of, say, Judd or Brookfield in its
stead. The State works, such as the rail-
ways, pay the workers more than the whole
product of their labor, apart from interest on


the borrowed money with w r hich the works
were built, so landowners and factory-owners
and such-like are taxed to make up the deficit.
They nominally belong to all the people.
But they really belong in the last resort to
the people who lent the money, and they can
only be taken over by confiscating these
people’s interests—in other words, repudiat-
ing the public debt. Repudiation is meant
as a matter of course. The debt is partly
held by local savings banks, mutual life Assur-
ance offices and so forth, which aren’t likely
to make the least resistance in their corporate
capacity, unless some robust officials fight by
instinct. They have nothing to fight about.
All the managements have to do is to put
on their hats and go home and leave their
depositors and policy-holders to whistle for
their money. And seeing that the land-titles
and mortgages will have become, in the
seizure of the “means of production,” as
valueless as the Government securities, there
will be nothing save the furniture and the
petty cash and possibly some human remains
on the floor to whistle for. The rest of the
.means of production owned “through the
State” represent several hundred millions’
worth of foreign loans. Whether the hold-
ers of these will induce their Governments to
take possession of Australia and put the
leaders of the Union in gaol for life no one
knows yet.
* * # »
A curious point is that the men who draw
up the programme of the One Big Bloodspill-
ing propose to take a course which must
almost certainly fill Australia with gore and
murder and muddle because they are wild
about their own incapacity or laziness or cor-
ruption. They are like the snake biting its
own tail. The “hopeless futility of existing
political methods” is given as the reason for
“revolutionary action.” The party which is
to revolushe in despair has been sole owner
of six out of the 13 Ministries which
have run the supreme Parliament of the Com-
monwealth, and half the members of a seventh
come from its party. There have been eight
Ministries in the last 10 years, and it has
owned five of them. It had a long spell of
office in N. S. Wales and is solidly enthroned
in Queensland. Having failed to put things
right when it was in peaceful control of the
whole apparatus of government, it now
gives its unsupported assurance that it can
put everything right by wrecking the appa-
ratus and climbing over the mangled re-
mains of the electors who get in its way. In
Queensland especially it will have to rush
its own Ministry and its own huge Parlia-
mentary majority with a torch and a meat-
aye to save the people from their own oppres-
sion. The affair is to be a rising of the
minority against the majority, there being no
one else —no king or nobility or ruling class
—to rise against. And when the rising comes,
as a section of the One Big Corpse certainly
intends, else it wouldn’t have drafted its won-
derful programme, there will be an exciting
few minutes for those who subscribe to the
doctrine like boys playing at pirates or chil-
dren bushranging in theory. In the time cf
hustle the half-hearted insurrectionist who
didn’t know it w: loaded is liable to be shot
at by two parties—by his opponents for being
in the upheaval and by his colleagues for try-
ing to back out of it. When “the day” arrives,
as it must, unless the men who live on the
revolutionary programme are to gradually
fall into disrepute and impecuniosity as mere
vvindbags, the well-advertised leaders will
fight with ropes round their necks. As men
in that position can’t afford to be left by
their followers, desertion will be put down
with a strong hand, and mild, middle-aged
artisans who have just found out that the
thing is real and want to back out may be
hanged lest the bdeking-out habit should
spread. Then a man who never killed a
relative before may be driven to do it in proof
of his sincerity, and being thus committed he
will wade in for the victory which means
immunity. Also he may commit himself
before lie knows what he is doing. A man
who tries his ’prentice hand at seizing “the
means of production” and gets into a heated
argument with the previous owner may do
things on the spur of the moment that he
never thought possible, just as the famous
Xed Kelly killed a policeman in haste and
then found it was too late to retract.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Dust Cloud in Europe.
Hungary is, or promises to be, another
country which has dissolved into a cloud of
dust and left no tangible or responsible Gov-
ernment to make peace with or collect a bill
from. With Russia and Hungary blowing
to and fro, and Germany threatening to
follow suit, the position becomes uncertain.
Over and over again experienced men like
Clemenceau, who had spent their lives
amid dangers and diplomacy, complained
that the pace of the Peace Conference was
too slow. The first essentials were to fix
the limits of the territory and the size of the
armaments that would be left to Germany,
Austria and Turkey, to fix their indemnities,
to sign the peace and end the suspense and
the blockade so far as the ending of the
blockade seemed desirable, and to be done
with the Three Boss Criminals except for
such supervision as might be necessary.
The division of the confiscated territories
could come after: having decided that a cer-
tain area should never be Austrian again, it
was absurd to postpone settling with Austria
till Serbia and Italy finished wrangling over
the division. The League of Nations, as
neither Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bul-
garia nor Turkey can be in it for a long
time to come, was an affair for the Allies
only, and could be arranged among them
after the Criminals were out of the way. It
was a case in which delays were loaded.
But Wilson, with his inexperience, his
ideals, his professorial philosophy and his
eye constantly fixed on the purely personal
question of his own hostile Senate majority,
spoiled everything. The League was his
pet project—a thing to be built up before
his spell of office ran out. It was to be the
glory of his life and the coping-stone of his
career. The surest way to get the hostile
Senate majority to pass it was to make it
part of the Peace Treaty, so that the rejec-
tion of the League would mean the rejection
of the Peace, and leave the United States in
the war single-handed. But while the Peace
hung about, first on one foot and then on
the other, waiting for the League, the state
of w T ar remained. Armies had to be kept up
in case the Peace missed fire. Para-
lysed industries couldn’t resume for want of
men and definite arrangements. War bills
accumulated. Soldiers grew restless and
unmanageable in the long uncertainty.
Enemy Governments, mostly provisional,
wliiph were wanted for the sake of their sig-
natures, began to lose credit with their own
people because they couldn’t give them a
settlement, and to be replaced by adventurers
of no authority. The adventurers might
promise to pay an indemnity, but they
couldn’t collect it, and other sets of adven-
turers with equal standing might repudiate
them. There was a time, fully described
in the books that Wilson used to teach
from, when the conqueror didn’t care whether
the conquered resolved ,into a cloud of
dust or not. If there was no Peace he
slaughtered part of them and sold the rest
as slaves, and took tin* country and all its
contents as an indemnity, dividing the land
among his followers. But these methods
are out of date. If the nations of the Ilun
Alliance resolve themselves into their con-
stituent elements, and decide to be children
of Nature without any ordinary institutions,
and enter on a century of passive resistance,
and intimate that no treaty is good unless
it has everybody’s signature, the nations of
Western Europe will collect very little and
will have to spend money on missions to the
half-naked Prussian heathen as they did 000
years ago. And meanwhile Wilson, the
idealistic procrastinator, will go home and
live far from the madding crowd, and culti-
late the Monroe Doctrine.
♦
* Ireland Again.
A cable stated last week that Ireland was
to be offered shortly “a modified form of
Home Rule.” Not the thing it was promised
and didn’t get five years ago, but a modifica-
tion of it. This is a revival of the mouldy old
policy of compromise which the lessons of
the war were supposed to have slain. The
Asquith Government followed it in 1915
and 1916, in its hesitancy to provide
enough men and shells for the firing-line.
Lloyd George is what he is because he
scouted any cowardly paltering of the sort
where the running of the war was concerned.
But the Irish Question seems to make party
politicians of the boldest. Lloyd George
has shown himself to be capable of any
audacity but that of calling Ulster’s bluff.
The Tory leaders in England are reasonable-
minded persons on almost any issue but that
of Ireland’s desire to govern itself. Swift,
in his “Short View of the State of Ireland,”
published just on 200 years ago, presented
an aspect of the Irish case that still stands:
We are in the condition of patients who have
physic sent to them by doctors at a distance,
strangers to their constitution and the nature of
their disease.
In the “Drapier Letters” he argued un-
answerably that justice and reason were on
the side of Irish autonomy, and that nothing
but “power and the love of power” kept the
country in bondage. Before Germany col-
lapsed there was an argument against the
immediate granting of Home Rule that
appealed even to many Home Rulers.
Strategically, Ireland was Britain’s
Achilles heel —a natural submarine base.
But German naval power is dead at the
moment; and it is unimaginable that Eng-
land and a free Ireland should not be recon-
ciled before it comes to life again. There
remains the claim of Ulster to “protection”
on the ground of its “unswerving loyalty to
England and the Empire.” Yet in 3914
Captain Craig, M.P., said publicly that he
would rather see Ireland conquered and
ruled by Germany than that it should live
under the fairly complete scheme of selL
government which the British Parliament
had voted it. Major Sharman-Crawford,
another Ulsterite M.P.. boasted that he
would “transfer his allegiance to the Kaiser
if Redmond got power.” Immediately prior
to the war the whole of that section of
Ulster which is now asking for protection
on the score of its loyalty claimed to be
ready for rebellion. Sir Edw t ard Carson
was in charge of the insanity ; the present
Lord Chancellor of England was his “gal-
loper” ; both informed Yon Kuhlman, in
Ireland, that “if their King swallowed Home
Rule they would look to another monarch.”
and simultaneously the Irish Churchman,
the chief organ of the Ulsterites, stated that
all arrangements had been made for “a
powerful Continental sovereign” to- give
every assistance to the rebellion. Was it
meant? If so, Ulster has small claim to con-
sideration at the hands of a country which
it was ready to betray. But it is more than
likely that none of it was meant. Had the
Asquith Government possessed the nerve to
act firmly with swashbucklers like General
Gough and Carson, not only wmuld Ireland
probably be at peace to-day, but —if ex-
Ambassador Gerard is to be believed—there
might have been no world war. Very few
seriously believe that any injustice, even to
Ulster, or any damage to the fabric of
Empire, will follow T if Ireland gets what it
should have had any time during the last
couple of centuries. On the other hand, a
policy of half-measures, if pursued long
enough, can only end in tragedy.

What Might Have Been—and Still
Might Be.
Acting Prime Minister Watt said the
other day that the war had added
£25,000.000 to Australia’s liabilities, and that
the Commonwealth is able to pay this
sum is more or less proved by the
fact that it is going to pay it, even
though the job may be done with diffi-
culty. Ever since The Bulletin was a
paper it has been saying what Watt has
only found out now —that Australia is able
to pay. What this paper said every week
was that it was quite easy to raise about £2
or £3 per head per annum for public works,
which would have obviated all the borrow-
ing and saved the £3 per head interest that
is now payable on the old public-works
borrowings. This would have enabled
the country to have more public works
than it has now, and the revenue
from them, instead of going to pay
interest to money-lenders, would be avail-
able to pay the expenses of the war.
But Tiie Bulletin’s contention that Aus-
tralia was able to pay 40s. or 60s. per head
annually to keep itself out of debt was
smothered by people who are now confessed
to have been either cowards or fools. And
they propose to go on fooling in the old way.
Having proved that borrowing was unneces-
sary, they intend to float new loans as soon
as possible.
The Easy Way of Salvation.
The S. Australian who a fortnight ago ex-
plained the simplicity of the One Big Union’s
way of salvation explains some more:—
All your trouble comes through not properly
understanding the meaning of the word “sufficient.”
The workers will produce sufficient for themselves
only, no more, no less. This cuts out all Surplus
Value; consequently there will be no Surplus
Value, and no national debt. “Sufficient” means
“enough of all things for the workers’ own needs, be
it machines, factories, railways, houses or racehorses ;
also ample provision for the widow, the orphan,
the weak and the sick. If everything is not pro-
vided for, then there cannot be sufficient. But they
won’t produce palaces for the boss and hovels for
themselves. They won't produce fine linen and
broadcloth for the boss and clothe themselves in
shoddy and rags. All this foolishness will pass
away when they decide to produce sufficient only
for themselves; and it will pass away without rob-
bing the banks and insurance offices, and without
bloodshed or the committing of one wrong or illegal
act. Produce no Surplus Value, but only sufficient
for their own needs, and rent, interest and profit
disappear. The boss doesn’t want factories, fields
or mines; he wants profits. Cut out his profit by
going slow and shortening hours, and he hands
over all these concerns to those who require them ;
and this ends the argument.
So it is admitted now that the workers will
have to produce more than enough for their
own immediate needs. In other words, there
will have to be a surplus laid by to provide
for, say, the construction of new railways or
to rebuild half a town after it has been
burned down. Thus there will have to be
banks which may be drawn upon, their capi-
tal representing the reserves of material,
food, etc. Who is going to control this
wealth? For if it is not controlled—if any-
one can just call in and take a handful—
there will be more non-producers than there
are at present. If, as is certain, there must*
be reserves of goods, produced by labor,
plainly the producer can’t get all that he pro-
duces as he goes along. Some of it will have
to be taken from him and put by. On the
amount put by will depend the extent of the
new railways, _ factories, etc., that can be
built. A man is not to be permitted to keep
more thah he needs; if he does he will
become a capitalist and be able to draw upon
the reserves. How then is he going to be
encouraged to produce more than he wants
for his immediate needs? Yet if he doesn’t
produce more than he needs there can’t be
the reserves previously mentioned, and there
can’t be the new railways, etc.
The Tailor’s Naked Customer.
The secretary of the One Big Union scheme
has announced with unobtrusive frankness
that the intention is to destroy the existing
unions by introducing to them the white-
ant of disaffection, and having brought them
to the dust to “build up from the ruins.”
The old craft unionism is the most precious
thing the workers possess, barring their free
and equal vote in the government of the
country, and it is a parlous thing to let a
crowd of new, fresh blowhards pull it down
on their mere promise to build something on
the ruins. Some people can’t be trusted
with ruins. The world is dotted /all over
with the wrecks of places that were pulled
down by parties known of unknown, who for-
got to build anything on the sites. In some
parts of Central America it is scarcely safe
to go out at night for fear of falling over
things of the sort. In fact, it is hard to
remember a case when the destroyer of a
city didn’t simply go away and leave it lying.
The French revolutionists were great oblitera-
tors of bad old laws, but they made new ones
as they went along. On the 0.8. U. principle
they would have first abolished all law, and
had an interregnum of chaos before they pre-
pared a new code, and if chaos got the bit
between its teeth and bolted there might have
been no new code. Chaos is a beastly uncer-
tain foundation, and unreliable in either
single or double harness. The regulation
Anarchist gag is that “it is necessary to clear
the ground before you can build.” The natu-
ral corollary is that it is necessary to burn
the old suit before buying a new one and to
go to the tailor naked. When the One Big
secretary does that, then he will show the
courage of his opinions.
The “Abolition of Vice” and Other Red
Herrings.
From M. Pickett (Melbourne) :
Having been connected with a society in London
for combating V.D. I was interested in the article
published in B. 6/3/’l9.
I would like to ask why it is more necessary to
examine the “prostitute” than the men who patronise
her, and why the woman has no more right to any
consideration than the men.
In France and Germany venereal disease is as
prevalent as in other countries in spite of the regu-
lation of vice.
The periodical examination of prostitutes is a
farce. To be efficacious it should be conducted after
every offence. In districts where these regulated
houses would be known to exist, men would have
no compunction in being seen, as they would only
meet those on the same errand as themselves. So
long as immorality is. deemed necessary to men, so
long will they feel no shame.
Who is to be the procurer of these prostitutes?
Are the keepers to be permitted to go into the street
and persuade pretty girls to enter these houses? Or
do women flock to their doors in such numbers as to
render the procuring by underhand methods (as exist
to-dav) unnecessary? I think not.
The White Slave traffic was, and is, the procuring
of these girls, and yet it is proposed to recognise the
houses that must secure the best, cleanest and pretti-
est girls, and when their health is ruined by living-
such a life they are thrown out, ruined in mind,
body and soul, scorned and shunned by the com-
munity.
In recognising houses, or registering prostitutes, is
it to be assumed that the thousands of occasionally
immoral women would register as prostitutes, or
become suddenly moral? There are many women
who will stray from the paths of virtue for the sake
of a full evening’s luxury and enjoyment, yet scorn
to receive payment in hard cash. The immoral flapper
is recognised in dealing with this question as being
the more likely to spread the disease than the
woman who plies her trade in the streets.
How can any man support a motion to recognise
immorality when he would rather shoot his daughter
or sister than see her enter a recognised house, yet
knows someone's daughter or sister must “foot the
bill” ?
Is it not time that boys were taught to be moral,
and the misery and dangers in lacking self-control
pointed out; also the awfulness and endless result of
this disease?
A campaign of combating ignorance on this sub-
ject should be organised through the length and
breadth of the country, and in all schools lectures
should be arranged, also in factories and large shops.
Above all stands the ideal of abolishing venereal
disease, says The Bulletin-. How is this to be done
by “regulating” vice instead of “abolishing” it? It
is like trying to stamp out diphtheria by “regulat-
ing” the flow of filthy drains, instead of educat-
ing the community to be clean, and so abolish filth.
Til conclusion, the abolition of vice, and the. regu-
lation of drink is far more to the point than the
abolition of drink and the regulation of vice.
Categorical replies herewith :—.
It is necessary to periodically examine the prosti-
tute because prostitution is a profession—“the oldest
in the world”—anil because the professional prosti-
tute, unlike every mail who goes with her, inevitably
becomes diseased sooner or later. It is also desirable
that men who consort with prostitutes should be
examined, and it might be ensured by a law requir-
ing every patron of a registered house to produce a
dated doctor’s certificate.
It is preposterous to argue that V.D. is as rife
under control as it is otherwise. The British army
in India was literally being destroyed as a result of
Gladstone’s abolition of the C.D. Act. Measures
undertaken by the Army authorities, without the sanc-
tion of Government, brought the tally of soldiers
incapacitated for service by V.D. down to 17 per
cent., which was the position at the beginning off the
war.
It is common knowledge that preventive measures
have been remarkably efficacious in the Navy.
Until the war began it was possible for people to
say loosely that venereal infectivity was as great in
(say) France as elsewhere. In the nature of things
there were no official figures. Since the war the
statisticians have been able to put the position in its
right light. Here are the War Office figures for the
B.E.F.
Venereal Disease Infection per 1000.
France .. 22
England .. 48
It has not been possible during the war for the
French to have the streets of their great cities effici-
ently patrolled, with the result that more women
were able to frequent the streets with impunity than
in peace-time. Tliat the latter class was responsible
for most of the infection is shown by two facts: (I)
Of all the women rounded up in the streets of Paris
during 1917 41 per cent, were found to be diseased.
11l one round-up out of 71 women arrested 55 were
diseased. (2) During the whole of 1917 only five
cases of V.D. were classified at the Medical Report
Centre, Pepinierc Barracks, Paris, as coming from
licensed houses. One of the outcomes of Britain’s
policy of unchecked promiscuity is that it has
become a dumping-ground of those foreign prosti-
tutes who, by reason of disease, find it impossible or
dangerous to carry on in their own countries. The
streets of London provide hideous proof of it. Who
can reasonably contend that these plague-dissemina-
tors are better loose than caged ?
As regards procuring, it would be the same
punishable offence to procure for a registered house
as it now is to procure for unregistered houses and
for private persons. There would be this difference,
that every woman before entering on a life of prosti-
tution would be solemnly warned of the certain re-
sults. At present, notoriously, many girls drift
almost unwittingly into the dreadful business. There
are houses which contain mere children, and there
are others where unspeakable infamies go on. The
police know, but it is not their business to take
action unless under direction.
(( Of course “occasionally immoral women” and
“immoral flappers” will continue to practise. And
in proportion to the number of diseased professionals
on the town, they themselves will become diseased
and will disseminate disease. In the matter of alter-
ing their point of view, the State will look hope-
fully to the Feminists. Whatever they can do in the
way of vice-prevention by education and by propa-
ganda will be gratefully accepted. But tfcese prophy-
lactics have been in use, more or less, for many cen-
turies, and they have availed little. Meantime fresh
infections are being incurred every vear bv the
hundred thousand. As the Council of the University
of Sydney Society for Combating Venereal Diseases
recently put it: “Legislation to deal with the fell
diseases of gonorrhoea and syphilis is more than ever
necessary if we are to cope with the situation that
must develop under post-war conditions.” The
Bulletin does not believe that vice, or any other
manifestation of the reproductive instinct, can be
“abolished” by fair words or education. But it does
believe that in an almost white-island Commonwealth
like Australia venereal disease can be abolished as
the bubonic plague was, provided the nation has the
courage of its ideals.
The Calamitous Resumption Policy.
By sticking to the resumption policy for
P ur P° se °f securing land for returned
soldiers the N, S. Wales Government lays
itself open to the charge of placing the
interests of landowning supporters and land-
agents before those of Billjim. The sys-
tem was proved a failure by the Wade
Government years ago when it started re-
suming land for closer settlement, having
been driven to that job by popular clamor.
Atter spending a heap of money it couldn’t
dodge the fact that it was in the position of
a man bidding against himself at an auc-
tion sale. Many of Wadf/s settlers to this
day haven’t been able to pay up their in-
terest. They were on the later resumptions
when the market had been forced up, for
there was a rise of something like a
hundred per cent, in the prices paid
for the later as compared with the
earlier purchases. If the same thing
has not happened with the present scheme it
is mainly because stiff values were paid
from the jump. That the Government is
paying too much for most of its purchases
is asserted by the Farmers and Settlers*

Association, whose members should at least
know something about what country land
is worth. Trethowais, president of the
Association, would pass the payment of
interest on these purchases on to the gen-
eral taxpayer to give the soldier settler a
better chance. But this would also give
the landowner a better chance to push his
price up. And land values are too high
from the producers’ standpoint already. If
both State and returned soldier are to be
given a sporting chance the most equitable
and the speediest method is the imposi-
tion of a supertax on the unimproved
value of all cultivable land within working
distance of a railway. That would steady
values and send landowners looking
for men to work the soil. There is still
much good farm land alongside the various
railways, which could absorb all the re-
turned soldiers and others who hanker to
go on the land. Incidentally, the utilisa-
tion of these areas would provide more
traffic for the railways and should reduce
freights. It is a stiff proposition trying to
make railways pay that run mostly through
unused country. The plan would harm
hardly anyone but the land speculator, as
the landworker knows by hard experience
that the financial concerns do not make
their advances on the basis of present in-
flated values. Here and there large land-
owners might suffer some loss, but seeing
that it is generally agreed that they would
have lost all they had but for Billjim,
they should be prepared to sacrifice a motor-
car or two. It is a tragedy to continue
putting the soldiers on the land at the
prices being paid in a competitive market;
and it is certain that in time, after the
landowner or land-agent and speculator has
got away with the swag, someone, probably
the community, will have to carry the baby.
The Public’s Bye.
Dear Bulletin. —Under the caption, “The
Sawbones Trade” (B. 20/3/T9), some medico
holds forth, incidentally, about opticians
in Queensland. The writer is either a con-
scious or an unconscious liar. The
Opti'cians Act of 1917 provides a £SO
fine for any person not being a medi-
cal practitioner who prescribes any drug
or treats any disease of the eye. The
Act and bylaws lay out a syllabus
for the sufficient training of optome-
trists. My experience of medicoes and
their own admissions go to show that not
one of them, if dragged straight from his
consulting-room to the examination, could
hope for a pass. The course of training is
thorough. It is high time that a few facts
were given to the public. This fool opposi-
tion of medicoes to optometrists has obtained
in every country. No one knows better
than an oculist that (except for a small per-
centage of myopic cases) the defects which
call for treatment by glasses are not diseases
of the eye. They are errors of refraction
due to congenital defect, or of physiological
failure of accommodation. Paralyses of ex-
trinsic or _ciliary muscles are diseases, but
glasses are not given for these defects by
trained optometrists —such cases are sent
*on to the oculist. The object of training
men as optometrists is chiefly that they may
quickly and certainly recognise diseased
conditions. Not one oculist in half a dozen
is good at sight testing. Medicoes look upon
it as an awful waste of time, as a rule ; and
it is only where the oculist makes optometry
a hobby that he is willing to take Hie
trouble and spare the time necessary. In
deed, the sight-testing done by the oculist
is usually beneath that done by an operator
getting £3 10s. a week. Also, if the opti-
cian makes a mistake he has to supply fresh
glasses without further charge and stand
the loss, whereas if an oculist makes a mis-
take it simply means another fee for re-
testing. The result is easily imagined. The
bulk of oculists are simply general practi-
tioners who take the eye specialty, as it is
the easiest and, perhaps, the most remuner-
ative of the specialties. The operations are
very few. and with one or two exceptions
desperately simple. Any watchmaker is
doing far more delicate work all day long and
thinks nothing of it. If the operation be a
failure it is always the fault of the eye—
never of the oculist! Finally, in the TJ.S.A.
optometry is taught by the Physics faculty
of the universities, not by the Medical; and
there are optometrists who never sold, nor
ever will sell, one pair of “specks.” They
simply test, the sight and give out prescrip-
tions like our Australian oculists. —Yours,
etc., PULEX.
Private Digger v. Public Funds,
An aspect of the case of Corporal Wil-
liams, M.M., shows the incapacity of the
military authorities to understand justice
as it is understood outside the Army. Wil-
liams, who is a returned man with a shat-
tered arm, claims to have been assaulted
in Sydney last February by two members
of the G.M.P. . He prosecuted the men at
a police-court. They were represented by
a Defence Department official. After argu-
ment, the magistrate declined jurisdiction.
Williams, being without funds. ■ had to let
the matter drop. Later he raised money
and returned to the charge. Fresh sum-
monses were issued and the parties met at
the Central Police Court. The Common-
wealth Crown Solicitor appeared on behalf
of the accused and asked for an adjourn-
ment. After the adjournment a privately-
instructed solicitor appeared, the Common-
wealth official having, so far as surface
appearances were concerned, dropped out of
a case in which he should have had no
part from the beginning; Another adjourn-
ment was applied for, in order that coun-
sel might be instructed for the accused. After
a week the solicitor re-anpeared in court,
with a barrister, lie was nominally the
solicitor on the record. Yet he occupied a
hack seat. All the work which is custom-
arily done bv an instructing solicitor was
undertaken by Mr. McCarthy of the
Commonwealth Crown-Solicitor’s Office,
Sydney. The Bulletin is unconcerned
here with the guilt or otherwise of
the G.M.P., their case being still sub
judice. The scandal lies in the fact that,
whether innocent or otherwise, the Common-
wealth Government should be backing
two soldiers against the soldier who claims
to have been wronged by them. The situa-
tion is an outcome of one of the most ancient
and unreasonable of military traditions.
Williams was charged in the first instance
h.v the G.M.I*. The Departmental assump-
tion would be that he was guilty and de-
served all that came to him. But the non-
militarist fails to see things in that light.
There is no justification, as the ordinary
citizen looks at it, for the spending of public
money on behalf of officials such as G.M.P.
in a civil action brought by one who claims
to have been wronged by them. The average
returned soldier is not a man of means:
Williams, for example, is a coal-lumper.
If in future civil cases between soldiers and
(say) the G.M.P. the former are to be left
to their own financial devices, while the
latter have behind them the whole monetary
resources of the Commonwealth, it is easy
to forecast in which direction most of the
judgments will go.

“Peg-Leg”: It is about time that in the
interests of public health the N. S. Wales
Government established a standard minimum
strength for disinfectants. Since the ’flu
epidemic started a score of new brands have
come on the market, many of them manu-
factured by a man and a boy with a bath-
tub in somebody’s back yard. Phenol is the
basis of the tar-oil disinfectants now in
use; and the claims of the manufacturers
as ito strength are often ridiculous. One
man guaranteed his stuff to contain 15 p.c.
phenol. When I analysed it I found it to
be only .45 p.c. Another man wanted to
sell me stuff he claimed to be 15 p.c. phenol
for 2s. a gallon ; he didn’t know that 10 p.c.
genuine strength runs into 11s. a gallon.
The seller can. indeed, claim whatever he
like's, and in 99 cases out of 100 the buyer
takes him at his word without worry-
ing about an analysis. Safety demands a
minimum of 10 p.c. of phenol; and the least
the public can- ask in times like thbse is
that it he afforded the same measure of pro-
tection in purchasing disinfectant to guard
human life as a cocky gets when he buys
fertiliser to give his potatoes a chance.
Advice to Australian coal-miners (and
others) : Call off the darg.
A man named Sobre was fined for being

“0.K.” : It is an obvious truism that the
success of hunger-striking depends not on
the determination of the individual striker,
but on the -weakness of the Government
which sets the striker free rather than let
him (or her) go the way of all unconvicted
persons who, wilfully or otherwise, remain
unfed for many days at a stretch. Man’s
courtesy to woman was responsible for the
preposterous precedent established in Mrs.
Pankhurst’s case. Her discharge from
prison, in a hungry and fainting condition,
gave the cue to a man who also evaded his
sentence by rejecting his meals. Any mur-
derer. burglar, embezzler or criminal
assaulter is entitled to as much considera-
tion as the other law-breakers have re-
ceived ; yet no burglar has thus far _ been
able to secure release by hunger-striking,
and we may be dead-sure none ever will.
“Murkah” adds to the list: —
The wholesale unnecessary use of the telegraph
by the various Government departments requires
attending to with a well-stropped axe. The Defence
Department is one of the worst offenders. Of every
batch of its wires there are a number (sometimes a
majority) whose purpose would have been better
served by letter. For instance, when returning
soldiers get a pay advance at an Australian port
previous to their port of discharge, the fact, with a
wealth of detail, is telegraphed to the “heads” at
the final port—a separate message for each case'.
The information is the same, yet the wordy rig-
marole is punched over the wires every time. Printed
forms with spaces for the soldier's name, number and
amount would obviate all this useless and expensive
energy;, and the overland mail would beat the
troopship. Rbcfently, at Adelaide, the Depart-
ment pushed in 01 wires informing the authorities at
Sydney and Brisbane of advances made to soldiers
belonging to those cities. Section 95 is another
much-abused Government monopoly. t'nder its pro-
vision telegrams can be sent “urgent” at ordinary
rates. Even wires to the suburbs asking Gertie
Out-of-work to come in next week and flail a type-
writer are Section 95-ed.

Charles Firman, 74, who died lately at the

believable number of years. The late E.

that it will depend a good deal on what the
doings are.

of the publication of this “libel.” He was
snorting with indignation. “Here, Cap,”
he cried; “see this about me? I’d like to
know who wrote that! I’d take him on
over 100 yards. Come on,” he added, mak-
ing a dash at the stairs, as if to demon-
strate his undiminished agility; "do I look
like a worn-out politician?” His sprint
petered out half-way up the steps; but I
let him win easily. “What—about —that?”
he gasped between breaths. I declared that
the other fellow would not have a look-in
over the distance he had mentioned.

Frank Rigo is entitled to a feather in his
hat for the production of “Bohftme” at Mel-
bourne Princess’s on Saturday. Evidence
of the long preparation which the opera had
received was visible in increased dramatic
consciousness and the unobtrusive but val-
uable work which the orchestra performed.
During, the first few bars the band seemed to
he uncomfortably impressed with the immen-
sity of its job, but it soon found the hand
of conductor Slapoffski, who thereafter
fathered it like the guide of a “personally
conducted” tour. Every scene was rich in
vocal achievement, but the singing of Bal-
boni’s Rodolfo was the feature of the even-
ing. Balboni’s tenor carried a greater load
of lyric intensity than the writer has heard
from any previous Rodolfo, McCormack in-
cluded, and there were occasions when the
note was so charged with emotion that it
almost broke into a sob. This was the sort
of singing that betokened a deep personal
interest in the tragedy, and Balboni never
weakened in his determination to drive home
every heartache in Rodolfo’s love story. The
final scene with the dying Miini was the apex
of his infatuation as an operatic lover, and
when he discovered from the faces of his
friends that his lady was dead, horror, sor-
row and self-pity struggled for expression in
his poignant howl of grief,

one felt that the blessed wrap ought to slink

ings, the character
demands from its
interpreter, Emelie
Polini, the ability
to hurry from a
whisper to a scream
without visibly fal-
tering at the dizzi-
ness of the gradi-

scene, which is
charged with pas-
sion in three or

actress is con-
fronted with a task
that is the nearest
thing to a switch-
back in vocal exer-
cise. Up and down
from a howl of
hate to a gentle
chant of imperti-
nent raillery, Miss
Polini provides the
psychological geography of an alleged prima
donna grown fat-headed and violent through
too much Moet and mad millionaires. It
is a merciless exposure for the character and
the actress, and Miss Polini emerges a trifle
damaged in her theatrical reputation, but
still curiously winsome, despite the ugliness
of the scene- Elsewhere she is unremitting
in her attention to the details of pathos and
sorrow which become her lot. Cyril Alackay
as the impresario Salvo, Maurice Dudley as
manager Picquard, and John' de Lacey as

cumstances in sister Gina’s dressing-room,
wherein the colored dresser (Georgia Har-
vey) amounts to a black smudge on the
seething surface of events. A. E, Green-
away’s art is sufficient lubricant for the
smooth working of Peter Hudson, whilst
Harmon Lee is the instigator of the judicial
conspiracy against Gina, whereof Gregan
AlcAlahon is counsel for defendant and
George Bryant the big Bertha for the pro-
secution. The play borrows its mechanism
from the cinema and its philosophy from
Charles Garvice. Still, if it is hard to admire
its argument, its machinery is worth while.
Also the excellent scenery keeps the eye
awake.
“Nothing but the Truth,” at Sydney Cri-
terion. is one of those jerry-built farces, de-
void alike of wit and of human interest,
which rely on the mechanical creation of a
series of odd situations. The motive power
is a claim, made by Robert Bennett (AI. B.
Figman), of the stock-broking firm of E. AI.
Ralston and Co., that he is capable of tell-
ing the literal truth. Ilis partners lay him.
an even 19.000 dollars that he can’t do it
for 24 hours. There should he scope here
for an expert farce-builder like James Alont-
gomery. But he disappoints. The whole
of Act 1 is occupied laboriously in leading
up to the bet. The “curtain” —the only
effective one in the play—is Robert’s first
disastrous truth. He tells a client of the
firm, over the telephone, that a stock which
the senior partner wants to sell is worthless.
He does the needless thing joyously—in the
spirit in which the unruly infant in the
small boy’s comic paper sets booby-traps for
adults. Alost of his other truths are on the
same lines. In between these hilarious
veracities he expresses anguish—by profuse
brow-mopping, by bogus attempts to flee,
and all the rest. One of the partners puts
several corner-man questions to him, ending
with “Have you ever killed anyone?” “No,”
he replies, “but I think lam going to.” And
a waggish little chase, on Sunday-school
picnic lines, ensues. There is the traditional
business with the sofa-cushions; they are
punched, swung in the air and (to express
uncontrollable emotion) heaved right across
the room. The key-w T ords “damn” and “hell”
are introduced. In short the whole thing is
what our Galic allies call vieux jcu.
There is no hint of the Government stroke
about the methods of M. B. Figman. He
is a worker or nothing. lie can’t even admit,
reluctantly, to his pained best girl that he
has loved a cannon-tosser without giving
the audience an exhaustive representation
of cannon-tossing. It gets a laugh, but so
would any other form of inapposite horse-
play. Mac M. Barnes plays Air. Ralston, a
vast, loud-voiced Yankee business man who
is threatened with financial and domestic
ruin by his partner’s temporary abandon-
ment of the conventional lies of our civilisa-
tion. Ilis chief stunts are pillow-bashing
and a distracted up-stage walk, with arms
raised in a manner expressive of despair.
Leslie Victor has done nothing feebler than
his low-comedy bishop ; the part is right out
of his line. Easily the most credible of, the
male characters is I’irie Bush’s Clarence
Van Dusen—an amusing study of a real
human being presented without overplay.
Lolita Robinson (Gwendolyn) is a beau-
tiful young woman with a fascinating
voice who gets everything possible out
of her part. Emma Temple is distin-
guished as Airs. Ralston, and Nellie
Wilson and Lucy Carter (Mable and
Sable) provide fantastically-tinted por-
traits of U.S. vaudeville artists. An anoma-
lous feature of the acting is that half the
performers talk the American language and
the other half the purest actorese.

❖❖ * *
From a Melbourne art-critic :
There are several young painters in Melbourne
who, having discovered that Max Meldruni is theii
long-lost lather, demonstrate their affection by
flaunting their parentage in the faces of mere artists.
Allan Wilson, now showing nearly 150 frames at the
Melbourne Athenaeum, is not exactly a dutiful child
of Meldrum, but he has all the brethren’s enthusiasm
for reducing Nature to a series of depressing weather
reports. The familiar phantasmagoria of brown and
bottle-green, studded with gloomy gum-butts and
loaded with damp and bronchitis, is a very common
Wilson performance which one is reluctant to
approach without an umbrella. Here and there
Allan has discovered the sun—especially in a couple
of glittering sea-pieces—but he will have to conceal
his "find” from his maddened parent, or he will be
classed as a heretic and be brained with a haggis.
As a portrait-painter Allan is the hero of the melo-
drama, “The had Who Took the Wrong Turning.”
In an unnumbered study, presumably a self-portrait,
we see him the comparatively innocent babe of the
schools, plainly bent on his own development. But
in the next two or three canvases the Master has
taken him up, and the flattered tyro is responding
with an imitation so slavish that it has almost the
ironical sting of parody. Two smaller portraits
(Nos. 19 and 75) are not so bad, but the big piece,
“Meditation,” is not only a chant on Meldrumism,
but the credo of a disciple. Meldrum is an extra-
ordinarily capable painter who originally became
celebrated as a dissident and welcome note in Vic-
torian art. Through his own technical competence
he is always attractive, but his influence is suffici-
ently marked to make his idolators notorious. Indeed,
his “school” has become a kindergarten, and his
“movement” looks like a plot for the exploitation of
his personality.
Adelaide Tivoli has got going again with
the Anderson Co. in the old Boucicault
melodrama “After Dark,” with Roy Red-
grave in. the fattest part. The theatre
scene is made an excuse for introducing
some good extra turns. Redgrave put in
a few days at the Majestic, but the light
fare which Sydney James offers there did
not give him much of an opening. Phil
Percival now fools pleasantly with a piano
in this programme. The success of “Dam-
aged Goods” continues to be the most sur-
prising thing in the picture line. The Royal
lias had to have a second short matinee
season of it, for women only. The Pav.
scores heavily with the surrender of the
German Fleet. Wondergraph varies be-
tween Charles Ray discovering German
plots, and getting heavily mauled in the pro-
cess, and a new heroine, Lila Lee, very
young and of much promise. At West's
is Norma Talinadge in “The Only Way,”
getting an “Eyes of Youth” effect by the
simpler process of just dreaming what will
happen if she marries the wrong man.
“Smike”: Bill was hurrying down to his
dugout with a sheet of galvanised-iron. Ail
English officer spotting him called out:
“Hey, where are you going with that bally
iron?” Bill turned and saluted. “Hush,
sir, not a word, sir,” he whispered; “I'm
camouflaged as a tank.”
Rear-Admiral E. P. F. Grant, shortly to
arrive as first naval member of the Common-
wealth Naval Board, was Chief of Staff to
Admiral Burney aboard the Marlborough at
the Jutland battle, and got the C.B. for good
work there. Later he was Chief of Staff for
the whole Grand Fleet, and became an i
Admiral about three months ago while com-
manding the dreadnought Ramillies.
The Rev. W. J. Eddy, sec. of the Metho-
dist Lepers’ Society, say there are about 70
victims in the Commonwealth —40 at Peel
Island (Q.), 20 at the Sydney lazaret, the
rest “elsewhere,” wherever that may be.
According to the same authority—who
should know something, since his society has
90 mission stations in 15 countries —there
are 250.000 lepers in India, 500,000 in
China, 10,000 in Ja_pan and 20,000 in Korea.
Considering the nearness of Australia to
these ravaged places, this country’s mere 70
suggests that Providence has been keeping
a friendly eye this way.
At Auckland there is a merry little follow
stumping around on crutches. Ilis name'
is Arthur Erickson, and he was once a well-
known Maoriland jockey. When the war
commenced he tried to enlist locally, but at
that time the stupid authorities considered
small men were of no use in the fighting
business. He then journeyed to Australia
and still couldn’t get a chance. Determined
to have a cut he worked his way to Canada,
and was there accepted. Fighting in France
he had one leg blown off. and eventually
returned to Auckland. Then the military
began to take an interest in him, and he
was arrested for failing to parade when
called in the ballot! The maimed midget
armreciated the joke much more than the
“heads’’ did.

As the figures for the latest balance were
being got together the war clouds were lift-
ing. So it is not surprising that the man-
agement admits a net profit greater than
had been shown for any previous correspond-
ing term. If the figures shown in the
profits column since the war represented the
actual results, the Union has had a com-
paratively poor time. In 1913 £900,000
was got in by way of capital and premiums.
The profits for the August T4-’l5-T6 half-
years averaged £148,817; for the three pre-
vious corresponding terms, £142,109. So,
if the old funds went on earning the old
rate, the new funds must have earned (net)
less than 1-J p.c. p.a. But disclosed profits
during the war are not to be taken too liter-
ally. Nobody knew what was ahead; in-
deed, nobody knows now. But the -wisest
feared early disaster. London Economist
a couple of days before Britain’s entry into
the war, tipped that “if we are entangled,
great financial houses, great merchants and
manufacturers will go down like ninepins.
I’apital will perish.” Things didn't turn
nut that way; yet because of the doubts as
to the future, cautious people like the Union
directors made greater provision for con-
tingencies. Expenses, especially taxes, have
also had a big effect on profits:—
Gross
Income (less
August Provision for “Colonial” London Income
half Contingencies). Expenses. Expenses. Tax.

1918 .. 467,108 246,314 23,533 38,281
Thus, though the gross profit after clipping
unspecified amounts for contingencies is
nearly £lOO,OOO greater than four years ago,
the net profit has grown by only £3OOO.
The recent margins between profits and divi-
dends have been considerably less than
formerly, but the fact that the directors are
getting in a further million from share-
holders, and that they will at the end of this
year have to pay out another £35,000 each
half if the 14 p.c. rate of div. is maintained,
suggests that they could shake out more
profit now if they cared to.
The comparatively small growth of the
balance-sheet figures, considered in conjunc-
tion with the greatly increased gross profits,
indicates how much more profitable business
must have been, despite the interruption to
exchange business and other minor troubles:

Four years ago 44 p.c. of all liabilities was
in liquid form :at Aug. 31, 37.3 p.c. Con-
sidering the nature of the new advances and
the opportunity the banks have had to make
a recovery on many of their old doubtful
advances, probably the position six months
ago was actually stronger than it was in
1914. An interesting movement in the
liquid figures during the year was the reduc-
tion of the money at short call in London
from £1,350,000 to £530,000, which is about
the normal level. Owing to the scarcity of
freights for the Commonwealth and the
heavy payments by the British Government
for our produce, about the middle of 1917
all the Australian banks in London held
large sums which they could not transfer to
their natural employment in the Common-
wealth. But during the year the position
gradually righted.
Present paid capital is £2,000,000 and
£2,148,278 of visible reserves had been accu-
mulated at August 31. Total shareholders’
funds, £4,148,273. All liabilities at that
date amounted to £26,994,761. So-for every
£1 of its own funds the bank held just over
£6 10s. of the public’s money. Now the
directors are putting out a further 20,000
shares of £75 each paid to £25 (the remain-
ing £5O is callable only in the event of wind-
ing-up), and at a premium of £25 per share.
This will bring in another million, and, on
present liabilities, the bank will hold about
£5 ss. of the public’s money for every £1 of
its own. This puts the concern in a very
strong position from the point of view of the
depositor and gives- the management plenty
of encouragement to go out after new busi-
ness. Possibly the directors think they can'
sniff profits in new fields, as the sharehold-
ers have been asked to agree to the “re-
moval of geographical restrictions on the
bank’s operations.” Incidentally, because of
the 100 p.c. premium on the new shares, the
14 p.c. div. is really giving only 7 p.c.
Though from the point of view of those u T ho
understand the position there can be little
complaint about the present method of in-
creasing funds, the 14 p.c. rate of dividend
invites criticism from those who don’t under-
stand that share-premium reserves and accu-
mulated profits are just as much share-
holders’ invested funds as the capital is.

This co. is probably the Speck’s oldest in-
habitant; also it is the second-oldest bank in
the Commonwealth. And, since recent amal-
gamations, there is only one smaller bank —
the little Ballarat concern. The following
comparison, going back to the Commercial’s
50th birthday, shows the slow progress that
has been made :—•

Thirty-six years ago shareholders’ funds
amounted to £209,236 and the net profit per
half-year was just under 6£ p.c. on the
funds. Funds now amount to £508,870, on
which the past half’s net profit is equal to
less than 4 p.c. There’s nothing to be joy-
ous about in that performance. The 14 p.c.
div. looks handsome, but since the reserves
amount to half as much again as the paid
capital the return on shareholders’ funds is
only about 6 p.c. Still, if this little bank is
not making its shareholders fat, it is certainly
a solid concern from the point of view of
its creditors. Total liabilities amount to
£2,089,289; so for every £1 of shareholders’
funds it holds only £4 2s. of the public’s
money. Looked at another way, there is
£1,373,973 of liabilities not represented by

This co-operative co., mainly engaged in
distributing, had its beginnings in the
Berrima-Mittagong-Robertson country in
1885. For years it struggled along, but
gradually cow-cocky became convinced that
it paid to get into a co-op. concern. And
while it gathered strength in its home dis-
tricts the management went afield and
roped in support on the North Coast. It is
not much use looking at the table to get a
view of what the co. has done for co-oper-
ators; for everything depends on how
cheaply the co. is handling farmers’ pro-
duce. By 1909 the Berrima management
had built up its organisation to such a state
of efficiency that the cost of distribution had
been reduced from 5 p.c. to 3 p.c. So 1 p.c.
was clipped off commission charges, which
meant that co-operators were getting an
immediate cash bonus of 25 p.c. on fire-
vious charges. The effect is shown in the
smaller profits and bonuses in the table for
some years after 1909. But even with the
commission reduced to 3 p.c., high prices,
aided by the arrangement with the British
Government to take exportable surpluses,
and the expansion of the concern, have
built up the earnings in great style. And
since exes, have not mounted at the same
pace, business is now much more profitable,
for the co. Five years ago commissions
totalled £11,116 and exes, (including depre-
ciation) tookJSO p.c. Last year commissions
brought in £25,428 and exes, swallowed only
67 p.c. Meantime the rebate to producers
on hutter commissions has been lifted from
10 p.c. to 33J p-c. This latter rate means
that the cost of distributing the farmers’
butter has now been reduced to 2 p.c.—a
very fine performance. In addition the
strength of the co. is being built up.
This shows how the balance-sheet figures
have moved since 1909; —

Expansion has been so rapid that the man-
agement recently decided to acquire a freehold
at a cost of £4375. To finance the erection
of premises and the growing business 3000
£5 shares paid to 30s. are being offered to
present holders. That the concern has been
able to handle hundreds of thousands of
pounds worth of produce each year on an
absurdly small capital has been made possible
only by the £20,000 of reserves accumu-
lated and the smallness of the book debts.
Looked at from the farmer’s point of view:
the bulk of his produce rs being handled at
the wonderfully low commission cost of 2
p.c., while he is getting 10 p.c. p.a. on the
few pounds he has put up. Besides that, he
is in an organisation whose job is to study
his interests all the time.

The Union Trustee had its beginnings in
Vic. in 18S5. Five years later it opened in
Brisbane: and four years ago a Sydney
branch was established, new shares being
put out on liberal terms to get the Ma
State interested. No indication is given of
the amount of trusts in hand, but a compari-
son of some of the figures with those of other
big shows which disclose the volume of their
business gives some idea of the figures:—
Commis-
sions and Ex-
Trusts. Interest, penses.
Perpetual (Syd.) .. £14,057,149 £48,267 £34,235
T., E. & A (Melb.) . . 12,861,050 37,846 24,6?2
Permanent (Syd.) .. 5,278,323 19,721 11,571
Union ? 33,920 21,801
The Union, like most of the big trustee cos.,
shows its income less commissions not
wholly earned; so the figures are not in-
flated. It would thus seem that the value
of estates administered is in the vicinity of
£12,000,000. The co. therefore ranks third
in size among the trustee concerns of
the Commonwealth. It has a big pastoral
clientele, and a Board that will drag in a
lot of business in N. S. Wales.
Progress has been very rapid over the
past 10 years. During that period £26.178
of new capital has been got in, and £4014
has been received as premiums on shares.
Paid capital is now £lOO,OOO. Since 1909
income has almost trebled ; and after paying
the increased div. of 94 p.c. for the past
year, the balance of Profit and Loss left to
strengthen reserves is greater than in any
previous year. This shows the balance-sheet
movements: —•
1909. 1919.
Liabilities .. .. .. £35 £74
Public securities . . .. 35,284 57,430

Loans on mortgage .. 21,777 —.
Real estate and premises 9,548 67,750
Fixed deposits, etc. .. 11,783 7,405
Thus all the new capital, the whole of the
profits accumulated in the 10 years and
about £7600 of the 1909 liquid surplus have
gone into property. Apparently the policy
has been to give the concern a more imposing
appearance, which may tend to bring in new
business and larger profits by-and-bye. In
addition to the £126,895 of shareholders’
funds to protect clients, there is another 30s.

Many things have happened since June 30;
so the much-delayed report of this very pro-
gressive co. is now ancient history. Still,
there is interest in it, if only because it in-
dicates a few of the difficulties that are
ahead. Turn, for instance, to the reports
of James Hebbard, manager of operations at
Broken Hill. This is two years’ record in
the matter of zinc concentrates: —
Produced. Dispatched.
1917 . . 55,990 tons 27,548 tons
1918 . . 42,761 tons 6.280 tons
There was on hand on June 30, 1918, no
less than 78,270 tons of these concentrates,
only about one-seventh of last year’s produc-
tion having been shipped; and it is reason-
able to assume that the Sulphide Corpora-
tion has been able to get away as large, a
proportion of its output as the other pro-
ducers, except perhaps the Broken llill
Prop. So there is a vast accumulation of
zinc material to be worked off, and this can’t
tend to improve the prospects of the spelter
market, upon which the profits of the
Broken Hill cos. largely depend. And in
addition to the_zinc concentrates from what,
is known as the wet mill there are on hand
about 6000 tons of slime concentrates.
None whatever of these were dispatched last
year.
The Sulphide Corporation has done great
service to the country as well as to itself.
It has been a pioneer in zinc-lead metal-
lurgy. It was the first co. to attempt to
smelt zinc in Australia. It spent very large
sums of money in experimenting to produce
zinc concentrates. At first it favored mag-
netic separation—the process which the
Germans had developed to some extent. By
that process in 1907 a recovery of 63.5 p.c.
of the silver, 58.2 p.c. of the iead and 72.3
p.c. of the zinc content was obtained. The
flotation process was at the same time being
developed. In that year (1907) a recovery
of 60.7 p.c. of the silver, 54.2 p.c. of the
lead and 67.7 p.c. of the zinc was attained.
For the past year the zinc section of the
mill showed a recovery of 78.5 p.c. of the
silver, 78.5 p.c. of the lead and 92 per cent,
of the zinc. But the improvement has been
greater even than a comparison of the fore-
going figures suggests. For it is not what
you recover, but where what you recover is,
that counts. A large percentage of lead in
the zinc concentrate is a curse and not a
blessing, a debt and not an asset. So the
co. has developed a subsidiary process for
de-leading zinc concentrates; and this shows
the result, the figures referring to the con-
tents of the finished zinc concentrates:—
Silver. Lead. Zinc.
1907 . . 13.40 z. 9.7 p.c. 46.2 p.c.
1918 . . 12.00 z. 5.9 p.c. 47.0 p.c.
So the value of the zinc concentrate has
been greatly improved by the elimination of
lead, and this excess lead has been caught
in a lead concentrate where it is wanted.
Magnetic separation has been discarded
altogether—happily, for it could never have
been a healthy process.
Meantime in the lead section —that is, the
preliminary process, the one directed to-
wards reaping a crop of lead and silver, and
leaving as much of the zinc as possible be-
hind—progress has been made, too :—■
Silver recovered. Lead recovered,
1907 .. 41.8 p.c. 64.5 p.c.
1918 .. 60.5 p.c. 77.6 p.c.
Tlie_silver in the lead concentrates was equal
to 65 p.c. of the silver in the ore; the lead
to 84.2 p.c.; the zinc in the zinc concentrates
to 81.4 p.c. While there are some further
losses in smelting, there is also some re-
covery of silver and lead from the zinc con-
centrates. Variable quantities of these
metals are saved as retort residues and put
through a further concentration process; but
this paper has no data as to percentages
recovered. They are not very high. The
co. owns zinc-smelting works in England;
but it was not able to import any of the
c-o.’s zinc concentrates last year. They used
to be able to treat 15,000 toils of
concentrates a year; but when exten-
sions in hand are completed they will

war they very rarely earned interest on
the outlay. With the large increases in
costs in England spelter will have to sell at
a much higher price if they are to pay in
future.

Ore reserves are 1,608,500 tons above

Tiie Bulletin showed uncouple of week .
ago that new business had been flowing int
the Insurance Office of Australia in sic
large volumes that the co.’s funds, measured
by the risks, had become too small. Sha •
holders at the annual meeting a few day 1
ago decided to do the proper thing and put
out the unissued shares. It is proposed to
offer holders two new 10s. shares paid to ss.
for every seven already held, at a premium
of half-a-crown. There are 111,530 shares
unissued, so £27,882 of new capital may be
got in, together with £13,941 in premiums,
thus augmenting the capital and reserves by
£41,823.

Goodwyn is out with a ffumonia policy for
northerners. For ordinary risks three months’
cover is offered for a premium of 10s. per
£lOO, six months 155., and a year £l. Double
rates are being charged for “hazardous” risks
—doctors, hospital attendants, etc., persons
over 60 and persons not inoculated. Maxi-
mum amount on any life, £1000; and the
policy covers any form of pneumonia. So
far the Northern State has entirely escaped
the epidemic.

Broken Ilill Junction is in difficulties once
more. It made arrangements to have its
ore milled by Amalgamated Zinc, Ltd., which
put up a plant for the purpose; and now
neither ore nor extraction is up to the esti-
mate. Sydney is in charge just now 7 . It
used fo be Melbourne. Afterwards it was
Adelaide. There is an idea now that things
would be better if the old game of musical
chairs was continued and Melbourne or
Adelaide took command again. But the
result will be the same. The Junction is a
stringer and always has been.
The present Broken Hill agreement ex-
pires in June, and the A.M.A. has drafted its
new demands. It wants £1 a day for all
classes of labor underground, men and boys
alike; the shift to be six hours bank to bank,
with half an hour off for crib; men to be
paid in the employers’ time ; work done on
Saturdays to be paid for at double rates;
seven days’ holidays each year to be paid for,
as well as Federal, State and municipal elec-
tions. Finally, for the encouragement of out-
side shows, work done more than two miles
from the post-office to be paid 25 p.c. extra.
It is possible that during the last two or
three years three or four of the principal
mines could have paid these rates; but there
are hundreds of thousands of tons of ore in-
even the best mines which they would make
unprofitable.

W. 11. Yates, vendor of Ivingsgarte Molyb-
denite. Glen Innes (N.S.W.). stuck out for
£25,000 in cash for the show. To date
John Brandon’s Melbourne co. has parted
up £15,000, leaving £lO,OOO to be paid, half
in August and half in February next. So
far the co. lias trod a path full of financial
brambles. Not a div. has come even with
the mineral at over £5OO per ton, simply
because reliance was put on the old plant
instead of scrapping it at once for a decent
mill. Result. calls. Capital account now
is £31,472, and cash has flowed out in this
way: Mine account, £27.500; plant,
£15,408; and stores, etc., £2750. Besides
the £lO,OOO due on mine purchase the co.
owes £7945. What is hoped is that the
new mill will vet going by May, and that it
will churn out profits from the start. If
not, more calls will have to be coughed up
to satisfy Yates. So it looks that the co.
isn’t out of the wood yet. Besides, the
metal market isn’t safe for a moment, and
if the co. is to get the £20,960 of profit
estimated to come out of the 8000 tons - of
tailings and hopperings on the £525 per ton
guarantee for molybdenite, it will have to
sprint. Colin Templeton’s forecast is that
the market will hold, but the same was said
about tin and lead. So far mining at the
Kingsgate has cost 365. per ton. With do-
velopment at (ss. 6d., milling at -Os. and
administration at 3s. lOd. per ton. costs ot
hand-picked ore tot lip to 120 s. per ton
against an estimated . revenue of 170 s. (id.
from 0.5(5 p.c. bismuth and 1.18 p.c. molyb-
denite. By milling 25 tons of that grade
stuff daily' a working profit of £21,150
annually is looked for. This is to be on
crudes f but as the hoppering and tails have
already borne the cost of mining, they are
to show a profit on 8000 tons of over
£20,000; which, if it is got, won’t be bad.
There is no statement of reserves, for the
pipes of ore have to be developed to get
them; but the Board is sanguine that the
co. won’t be stranded because of failure in
that direction. Altogether big hopes, little
ore, and a modest dump of tails are the
proud possession of the Kingsgate.
With two 10-head units in action Mam-
moth Molybdenite (N.S.W.) calculates on
increasing its present average ore-output of
about 40 tons a day to at least 85 tons. Re-
turns have not been shouted lately, but there
is nothing to justify anticipation of anything
much beyond .25 p.c. ore. On the Broken
Hill Brop.’s option area thorough prospect-
ing by tunnel and drill continues. No
announcement has been made abo t the co.’s
attentions; but that it is hanging on so
long and doing so much work makes the
als very hopeful.

Another storm is likely at the annual
meeting of Gippsland’s Jumbunna coal
crowd. The past six months’ work showed
it loss of £9OO instead of the promised profit.
But the co. didn’t have a chance, for it hit
a bunch of faults, water was heavy, and
labor gave the district the cold shoulder.
The glimmer of light is that some of the
broken ground has been passed through, and
in No. 2 south at least 34ft:. of good coal
shows. What pinched the treasury was
the money that had to go out to try to
straighten things at the north tunnel,
where ever since the fire of three years ago
efforts have been made to get the men back
to the faces. The co. now throws up the
sponge so far as this job goes, for water is
flowing in from the old Outtrim mine. This
surrender means giving up the chance of a
second tunnel for the mine, as well as a
loss of some good machinery.
.Jim Mackay and Little, of the Miners’
Union, foregathering over the New Langi
Logan (Vic.) labor position, are knocking
together a working agreement by which that
hung-up show can get a move on again.
The trouble for months has been the deter-
mination of the local men not to- tender
for work in the Ararat mines. When they
did tender their price meant paying calls
to keep the mine going; so all that could be
done was to pump and whistle for the fav-
oring breeze to blow men along. That hap-
pened when Cobar shut down.
* * * *
Mary Mac, Lavcrton (W.A.), has swal-
lowed the whole of the share capital with-
out giving even a smile in return. The con-
cern has not yet reached the producing stage.
Bank overdraft now stands beyond £2OOO,
so shareholders are to be asked to increase
the co.’s capital in order to wipe the slate
clean and provide enough to get the plant
talking. It is claimed that the great bodies
of low-grade ore are now sufficiently opened
up to feed pay-tonnages to the battery.
Manager Lilburne offers the opinion that
“while values remain as at present shown in
the faces and stopes” profit-earning won’t be
difficult. On a basis of 1500 tons per month
he reckons costs (including administration
exes.) will take 14s. per ton. Present bulk
value is claimed to be 255.. and in an experi-
mental run of over 400 tons only 4s. 4d.
drifted into residues. So all that is now
necessary is for shareholders to put up the
required cash and hold their hands in readi-
ness for the flow of divs. It’s quite simple.
* * * *■
Riverina South (W.A.) feels so poorly
that shareholders have given the manage-
ment authority to let portion of the show on
tribute. All the co.’s money has gone in
remodelling plant—while there are debts of
about £ll,OO0 —and the directors hope that
the tributors will provide the cash to pay
for further necessary development. The
last ore-estimate was 15,795 tons worth
£37.657. Dependence on tributors’ doles is
a pauper method of financing, anyhow.
* * * *
New Commodore, Meekatharra (W.A.), is
so hard-up that the mine is idle. Now the
Government Geologist is to be asked to in-
spect. All the work done on the boundary
of the tngliston to pick up the shoot that
ought to have pitched into the Commodore
but didn’t, has only proved faults and forma-
tion, but if the geologists opine that the
mine still has a chance, then the Treasury
may be asked to foot some of the bill.
* * * *
“O.B.”: Re “Nitro’s” remarks about ex-
plosives (B. (5/3/T9) and the high price
the Westralian mine-owner has to pay for
them. Briefly, the position is that prior
to war gelignite was the principal explo-
sive used in Westralian mines, and the
regulations provided that one ingredient
must be nitrate of potash. When war
broke out there was found to be a shortage
of potash, and the regulations were sus-
pended to enable gelignite containing nitrate
of soda instead of potash to come in. Now
the suspension of the regulations lias been
removed, but in order to give time for
adjustment of supplies the suspension will
not be terminated until the end of this year.
Strong representations have been made to
permit the permanent introduction into
Westralia of explosives containing nitrate
of soda under the name of gelignite, but the
Mines Department won't agree. The De-
partment claims that it lias not placed any
obstacles in the way of importation of any
explosive, nor does it prohibit the importa-
tion of explosives containing nitrate of soda,
but it does insist that after the end of this
year the latter shall not be called gelignite.
There is, it states, no intention on its part
to favor any importer, and certainly not to
favor any trust or monopoly. Its object is
merely to protect the consumer and those
engaged in the use of explosives in deep
mines.
• • * •
From the Australian representative of the
Nobel’s Explosives Co.: —
“Nitro’sO par. (B. 6/3/’l9) is misleading and
unfair. During the whole of the war period this co.
ha 3 supplied explosives to the Westralian gold-mines
at lower prices than the prices of similar grades in
any other States. ( The recent amalgamation of British
manufacturers of explosives has not been carried out
with the intention of exploiting consumers. The
amalgamated cos. are willing to make contracts with
Australian consumers on a co-operative basis, that is,
actual cost plus a moderate and specified percentage
tr, cover interest and depreciation. During the war
the manufacture of explosives in Australia lias been
multiplied tenfold, and now amounts to fully one-
third of the Australian demand. The amalgamated
cos., including the present Australian factory, are
now considering a scheme to considerably enlarge the
Australian output.

“rite Pioneer (Tas.) tin record now is
9,771,100 cub. yds. drift sluiced for 6816
tons tin oxide. The average per cub. yd.
has been 1.5721 b., won at a cost of 5.844 d.
per yard. With a decent water supply C. G.
Ryan did better work during the last half-
year, so the Board was able to let out 3s.
per share in divs. and keep a comfortable
cash balance up its sleeve. The better water
pressure enabled costs to be cut by a fifth
of a penny. Though that does not appear to
be a lot, it mounts up when a big yardage
is melting before the nozzle. The average
grade of the dirt at the Pioneer mine itself
was over lib. oxide, as a good deal of bot-
tom drift was available. Near St. Mary’s
the co. is working its Argonaut leases,
which from a narrow run of terrace and
creek ground gives about 0.871 b. oxide per
cub. yd. To date this little patch has turned
out 278 tons stream tin from 713,000 cub.
yds., so that it has not been a bad invest-
ment even with costs at about 6|d. As a
side-show. Ryan runs the South Pioneer,
alongside the big claim, and gets a little
tin; but the burden of keeping up divs.
attaches to the old show he has handled so
well.
* * * *
An effort is to be made to revive the iron-
ore workings near Beaconsfield (Tas.).
Geologist Twelvetrees is engaged on a com-
prehensive survey. In the early ’seventies
there were smelting-furnaces at Port Lem-
priere, Swift’s Jetty and the Sugar Loaf.
The remains of the, jetties used are still
standing in the Tamar as reminders of the
time when the shipment of iron was a big
asset to the Speck. The general opinion
is that if the chrome difficulties in some of
the bodies can be economically overcome
the district will return to the prosperity of
its nalmiest days.
The little Royal George. Avoca (Tas.).
says it can’t stand up to high costs and
a declining tin market, and has closed down.
The lode is from 20ft. to 30ft. wide, but the
grade only about 4 p.c. A recent return was
5 tons concentrates from 834 tons crudes.
The pyritic nature of the ore, necessitating
roasting, helps to sky costs. The A.W.U.,
however, alleges that the shut-down is
an answer to a long-sought increase in wages,
and that the show can be worked at a profit
at present prices. The miners back their
opinion with an offer to work the show on
tribute; and under safeguards to secure
proper working they ought to he allowed to
do it.
After a spell of 14 months Ben Lomond
Republic, Avoca (Tas.), has taken on a new
lease of life under Melbourne management.
The first ton of ore has been' sent to the
smelters at Launceston, and the mine man-
ager reports having opened up a new lode
carrying good values.
The asbestos-mine at Beaconsfield (Tas.
is closing down. The shortness of the fihi
is said to be the chief trouble. It generally
is.

A BALLAD OP BLATHER.
[Eon The Bulletin.]
Bill Blather had a great ideal—*
The Brotherhood of Man.
On Sabbath days, in the Domain,
It was hi i custom to explain
The world-reforming plan.
<It’s so simple. A child can work it.)
’Twas Capital, so he averred,
That caused existing woe.
“Get rid o’ Capital,” said he,
“And the Millennium will be
A joy you all shall know.”
(’Ear, ’ear, Bill! Three cheers for Blather !)
In him the One Big Union found
A sturdy advocate;
’Twixt Capital and Labor he
A gulf unbridgablc could see,
A truly awful state.
(No flies on William I)
“Employers must be swept away,”
So his addresses ran,
“The silvertails ha’ got to go;
By starving ’em to death we’ll show
The brotherhood of man.”
(That’s the talk, Bill. Put the boot into ’em—
the cows!)
An argument so logical
Appealed to not a few,
And Bill, amidst prolonged applause,
Soon won adherents to the Cause,
The magic O.B.U.
(But restrain your enthusiasm, please.)
Then Bill one day received a note
Informing him that he
Had lost his Aunt Matilda, who,
Although not reckoned well-to-do,
Had left some property.
(Oh, a shrewdy was Aunt Matilda!)
And handsomely did it pan out —•
Scrip, war bonds, house and grounds;
It much surprised the next-of-kin
To find Aunt Til had gathered in
Some fifteen thousand pounds !
(Twelve hundred thousand beers! Think of it,
brothers!)
, And all of it was left to Bill—•
To Bill, the Friend of Man,
The toiler’s chum, the worker’s pal,
I he bitter foe of Capital,
The Good Samaritan.
{Consequently:)
lie now resides at Moshian Bay,
As tony as can be;
Ilia villa has a harbor view,
And if you mention O.B.U.,
He says O.U.B.D.!
N.S.W. THE MASKED MILLIONAIRE.
HIS RULE OF HEALTH.
“No person will be allowed to remain in a hotel
bar for more than five minutes.” —’Flu regulation.
“ You've "been here ten minutes —what do
you mean by it?”
"It's like this, Constable. I suffer from
indigestion, and the doctor tells me to
always chew my food thoroughly.”
There are 58 students at the Melbourne
Pharmaceutical College, and half of them
are girls.
Of the 50 delegates to the Federal Conven-
tion which met at Adelaide 22 years ago, 21
are alive—Barton, Carruthers, McMillan
and Walker (N.S.WA : Quick, Deakin,
Peacock, Isaacs, Trenwith. Higgins and
Fraser (Vic.) ; Cockburn, Gordon, Symon,
Glynn and Howe (S.A. ) ; Fysli, Lewis and
Clarke (Tas.) ; and I Alton and James
(W.A.). Thirteen of the 21 went into the
Federal Parliament, but Paddy Glynn is
the last of the survivors to remain in Fed-
eral politics. Carruthers, Peacock and
Lewis continue their membership of State
Parliaments.
From a Gallery hand
Attorney-General Groom is the most promising
candidate for a halo in either House of the Federal
Parliament. Upholder of the Decalogue and all the
Statutes, preserver of public purity and private gen-
tility, Littleton Ernest, if he hadn’t dedicated him-
self to the political job, would have turned his collar
round and made a bid for a pair of gaiters. He is
never seen in doubtful society. The pasts of all his
friends must yield naught to the microscope in the
way of personal peccadillo. As regards political
acquaintances, he is compelled to be a little less
particular, but in this matter he is diplomatist
enough to know that many a blush can be saved if
you do not inspect too closely. Perfect gentleman
and unimpeachable
husband and
father, his one
dissipation is to
hand out cake
and buttered noth-
ings at tennis tea-
parties. Every
Saturday or so
when he is in
town he engages
the tennis-court in
the Parliament
grounds, and ap-
pears as a flan-
nelled host to a
righteous squad of
old ladies, maid-
ens and' youths,
never playing any
tennis himself, but
getting as much
pleasure by dash-
ing about in his
attentions.

Just-dead Edward Charles Stirling, M.A.,
ID.Sc., M.D., F.R.S., who was in Parliament
(between 1883 and 1886, was the first,S. Aus-
f legislator to introduce a bill to extend the
franchise to women; and S. Aus. was the
first State to have this reform.
From the Scotsman (4/2/T9) :—.
An example of temperament might be men-
tioned in connection with the big gun captured by
the Australians outside Amiens. Mr. Hughes visited
the spot, was duly impressed, and had a hammer
and chisel brought to him with which he carved
in indestructible characters a name on the barrel.
It was not that of Australia, or of the Australian
commander, or anyone who had been associated
with the capture. It was the simple name of
Hughes.
An “example of temperament”? The Aus-
tralian name for it is colossal hide.
Killed in England, by a fall of 2000 ft.,
through the failure of a faulty machine,
Flight-Commander J. M. Hancock, of Bir-
chip (Vic.). It was shocking luck, for his
discharge was awaiting him. His father, H. A.
Hancock, of Melbourne, had a letter from
him dated January 26. “I flew down to San-
rown races on Wednesday,” he said, “and
gave them an up-to-date exhibition of steeple-
chasing—drove the ’bus round the steeple-
chase course and cleared all the hurdles in
what were literally flying jumps. The
novelty of it ‘took’ the spectators and the
sporting papers were full of it.”
James Heading Fairfax, who died in
Sydney last week, was five or six years old
when his father bought a half-share in the
Sydney Herald, and 32 years later, when
it had become the S. M. Herald, he went 1
into the office. That was 69 years ago.
Old John’s partner was a reporter, Charles
Kemp; they bought out the original pro-
prietors, Stephens, Stokes and McGarvie.
Kemp went out after a very few years, and
first Charles and then J.R. came in. It
was on “Mr. James’s” entry that the fifrn
became John Fairfax and Sons, and So it
remains, although within the last half-
dozen years the proprietary has been regis-
tered as a co. There have, however, been
only three people in it—James and his two
sons, Geoffrey and J.O. A character-sketch
of "Mr. James” mivht be written in one
line: he was exactly like the S. M. Herald.
The Osnabrucker Volkszeitung recently
wrote that “Britannia is the grandmother of
Satan.” The writer has got things mixed. It
was Queen Victoria that was the grand-
mother of the late Kaiser.
Dr. Cleary, of Auckland, is probably the
first R.C. bishop to go aeroplaning. He
flew from Kohimarama to Kauntana, a dis-
tance of 65 miles, doing the distance in four
minutes over the hour.
The new Australian Fleet Commander,
Commodore Dumaresq, C. 8., M.V.0., born in
Australia, commanded the Shannon at the
battle of Jutland. That job got him the C.B.
After that he commanded the Sydney, then
the light-cruiser Succeed, and finally the
battle-cruiser Repulse, which was in the
Heligoland fight. In the Navy they regard
Dumaresq as one of their front-rank torpedo
specialists.
The very learned S. Australian Professor
Jethro Brown, President of the local Indus-
trial Court, said “No” to the offer of a
chair at Cambridge last month.
Thrice Mayor Richards, of Sydney, has
appointed Joseph Woodhouse (Wesleyan) as
his official chaplain. This is the first appoint-
ment of the kind in N. S. Wales, though in
1858, when John Thomas Smith, seven times
Mayor of Melbourne, went to London with
an address to the Queen on the marriage of
the Princess Royal, he took C. T. Perks
(Anglican) with him as his spiritual com-
forter. And he needed him, too, when he
was turned back home without the expected
title.
Castlemaine, the Vic. township which was
once famous chiefly for its gaol and its
brewery, is acquiring the impression that
it is the hub of the universe. Not content
with being represented in Federal and State
Parliaments by a Prime Minister and Pre-
mier respectively, it has now furnished the
A.N.A. with its Chief President for Vic-
toria —G. D. McLean, the secretary of the
local branch.
The trustees of the State Savings Bank of
S. Aus. have given manager W. B. Poole a
dinner on his retirement after nearly 23
years in the chair and 50 in the service of
the bank. Of course he beamed, as well
he might, over the S. Australian Savings
Bank record —70 per cent, of the whole
population are depositors, with an average
of over £26 to credit. Mudie, lately account-
ant, with a record of 43 years’ service,
follows Poole; Craigie steps up to the
accountant’s desk.
Died last week, at 80, Thomas Durack,
father of Fanny, the world’s woman-cham-
pion swimmer. About 40 years ago Thomas
Durack became landlord of a quaint old pub,
The Cheshire Cheese, which was then sur-
rounded by what an agent might have termed
a “good business community” in Wexford-
street. In time he demolished the old pub
and built the handsome house which still
adorns the site.
Died at Orange (N.S.W.), aged 54, Dr. J.
K. Freyer, brother of a Ilarley-street sur-
geon who, it used to be said, received the
largest fee on record for an operation—about
300 guineas. Dr. O’Hara, of Melbourne,
claimed, however, to have had a fee of a
thousand guineas—on which Purves, K.C.,
made a remark that brought on a bout of
fisticuffs in Collins-street. The Australian
Dr. Freyer served in the S’African war.
Hugh McKinnon, who died of flumonia at
Wyalong (N.S.W.), trudged the Inky Way
in bush from time to time. He learned
to “pick the case” at Young, pushed on till
he was proprietor of Canbelego Advocate,
and after that became lessee of Wyalong
Star. Later he went out of the line, and
took to handling wheat at Wyalong. But he
was even better known as a long-distance
cyclist.
H. A. Fitzpatrick, now retiring on pension
after 53 years’ service in N. S. Wales Lands
Department, is a son of the late Michael
hitzpatrick, who was that Department’s first
Under-Secretary. I n dad’s day, however,
Lands and Works were combined.
Though he kept out of the limelight during
the strike, manager H. S. Dix, of the Mal-
vern (Vic.) tramways trust, is the person
on the staff physically best fitted to have
the “spot” on him.
Dix looks more like
a movie-star than a
prosaic traffic boss,
but is less conscious
of it than most
screen-heroes. The
man who took the
centre of the stage
was Cameron,
Chairman of the
Trust, d solicitdr
who happened to be
in the local council
when the enterprise
was launching. He
has probably learned
a bit during the last
few weeks. Hi s
education certainly
had n’t previously
been completed.

P. W. Rudd was sentenced to the gallows
at Adelaide a day or two ago for murder.
The newspapers described him variously as
“callous.” “brutal” and “joking in the face
of death.” Well, why not? In a world with
oceans of trouble, his is a mere drop.
Christopher Bolt, of Forster, Murray
River (S.A.), who reached 82 the other
day, was one of the first men in the world
to drive a reaping-machine. It was in S.
Aus., of course, where the thing was in-
vented, and it was moved along by bullocks,
which pushed from behind.
Eighty last week, Dr. Burgess, the able
Methodist parson of Adelaide. He has been
president or secretary of everything in his
own denomination, incidentally holding the
editorship of its local journal. He was Sec-
retary of Adelaide Children’s Hospital till
he was 74, and is still sec. of the S.A. branch
of the Geographical Society. And he
preaches twice every Sunday.
Australians who went to the Royal Air
Force training ’drome in England, where
Flight-Commander C. M. Chateau, pioneer
of commercial aviation in Australia, was on
duty, were introduced to their instructor on
these lines by the 0.C., a dry old stick i
Australian, eh ? Anzac ? Ah ! One of the
desperadoes? Suppose you’d like a desperado
to train you—what?” Just at the moment
when the bewildered Digger was beginning
to wonder if the Red Tab was ratty,
Chateau would be brought on the scene.
From London: —
General John Monash had the centre of the stage
at the celebrations of Anniversary Day (Jan. 26).
At the corroboree in the Connaught Rooms organised
by the A.N.A. he was heralded as “the greatest citi-
zen soldier Australia has produced.” In a brief
address he declared that most people had only the
vaguest conception of the magnitude of the Austra-
lian effort during the last six months of the war.
It was a “veritable epic.” Monash is said to be
writing the history of those epoch-making months,
the book to be ready some time in May.
David Milne, just dead at close-on 70 at
Goolwa (S.A.), had given all his life to the
Murray. It was something like E. J.
Brady’s “River Rovers” trip from the head-
waters to the sea, only it was spread over
half a century. Milne came to Australia as
a young Scotch seaman, and settled at
Echuca (N.S.W.), where he did a lot of the
early _ boat-building for the river. In the
’eighties he moved down-stream to Mildura,
thence to Renmark, Morgan and Mannum,
finally settling at Goolwa, close to the river’s
mouth.
“Sr”: Dr. O. Wunderlich, whose interest-
ing diagnosis of the ’flu germ’s holiday in
Melbourne the Age printed, is a medico who
can wear a large part of the alphabet after
his name. But he has given up “practice,”
and with two brothers, managing direc-
tors of Wunderlich, Limited, is show-
ing what can be done industrially in
Australia. As a very active manager
in his company, he is an authority and
expert on factory-costing and organisation.
Incidentally, he can make the hour glad at
the piano; when that tires he’ll modestly
show you some happy South African
sketches; and as a motorist he has driven
from Adelaide to Melbourne and from Mel-
bourne to Sydney many times, and he always
takes himself as a mechanic.

MINCHINBURY
Pat Riot ’: Billjim is a winner of hearts
as well as of battles. The children at Beug-
nies used to have an annual Fete Day, but
it. was killed by the war. Hearing of this
the chaplain to the 30th Battalion, A.LF.,
quartered there, put the matter to the boys.
There and then 1000 francs were subscribed
for the purchase of gifts and good things.
In their spare time the Diggers decorated
tbc hall that had always been used for the
affair, and when the great day arrived their
brigadier presented the toys', thawing the
timidity of the recipients, among whom were
THE ABSENTEE.
SALLY: “Why are you Australians so keen
on marrying over here? Is it just be-
cause your wives get a passage to Aus-
tralia?”
BILL: “Perhaps—and perhaps it's because
their mothers don’t.”
many orphans, with the homely French kiss.
Moving pictures were taken of‘the gathering,
the delighted kiddies wearing Aussie hats
with great glee.
Soldiers who have married in
England and whose wives are to be brought
to Australia will probably be distressed by
the sensational things they have read re-
garding the treatment of the mothers and
babies who came by the Osterley. Most
of what has been printed is untrue. In the
first place. Dr. Buckley, whose name has
been so often mentioned, did not come in
charge of any women or babies at all. She
was one of three A.A.M. officers detailed
for duty to attend to sick troops, wives of
Australian personnel, etc., en route. The
5.M.0., Major Cross, of Melbourne, was
O.C. Pie detailed Dr. Buckley to attend to
the women and children of I. and 11. classes,
and to give a series of clinics to mothers
of all classes on baby-feeding, etc. The
doctor who did the bulk of the hard work
aboard was Capt. A. D. Forbes, R.A.M.C.,
of North Sydney, and four years in France.
He was O.C. of all babies in„ hospital, and
for one month of the voyage there were on
the average 10 babies under treatment.
This officer, in addition, attended practically
all the women (650-odd) in 111. class and
all the 150 troops aboard. Dr. Buckley is
reported in numerous papers to have alleged
that the ship ran out of food for babies.
This is not true. There was never any
shortage; and fresh food was procured, as
per purser’s programme, at every port. The
numbers on board constitute a record iu
immigration to Australia. There were 250
children under three years of age and 95
under one year, with 800 women. A baby
show towards the end of the voyage revealed
the fact that a finer lot of children could not
be got together. The type of child was
magnificent; only two died —one an infant
born prematurely and the other in convul-
sions.
* * *
“R.D.”: The Chow came in to register the
birth of a child. (I knew that Charlie had
“taken up” with a widow.) “Father’s
name?” I asked. Charlie scratched his
bristles. “Poor lille boy,” he said ; “allesame
his father die five years ago.”

“The Oldest Inhabitant”: An interesting
bit of old Sydney will come under the ham-
mer presently—a collection of low-built cot-
tages known as Queen’s Court, in Dalley-
street. As far back as February, 1835,
Samuel Lyons advertised them for sale by
auction, describing them as “12 new brick
dwelling-houses, counting-houses and spaci-
ous vaults, situate on the north side of
Queen-street, opposite the Main Guard. The
property has a frontage to Queen-street
and opposite the Tank Stream, over
which the new line of Pitt-street is
proposed to be carried to the intended quay
behind Maequarie-place.” The land upon
which the court stands was a grant for 500
years to Edward Hunt, a cabinetmaker of
Jamieson-street. Mr. Hunt was an enthusi-
astic teetotaller, and in his warehouse was
held the first meeting to establish a tem-
perance- society, presided over by Chief
Justice Forbes. In one of the cottages in
1840 lived Henry Parkes. At that tiir« he
worked at Russell’s foundry, then clos, by.
* * * *
“Smike”: Captain Blinks had the gamb-
ling habit badly. One night, at mess—it was
while he was temporarily
attached to an English regi-
mental staff —he asked the
Colonel, who had been in
India, if Indian veterans
didn't develop a nicotine
stain betwmen the shoulders
through smoking Hindu
cheroots. The Colonel said
“Absurd!’’ but Blinks in-
sisted that it was a fact and
offered to bet his superior
that hi 3 information was
correct. Now, the Colonel
burnt cheroots, and he re-
solved to make some easy
money and humiliate his
cocksure Australian subordi-
nate by accepting the bet at
a long price in his favor.
Thereat the gallant soldier
took off his tunic, proudly
showed his unspoilt back,
and collected from Blinks.
The next day the Colonel
mentioned his success to
Blinks’s former 0.C., wdiom
he encountered casually.
“Don’t get proud,” said tlie
Australian O.C. when he
heard the tale. “Blinks wins
on thia deal. He bet us big money that he
would make you take your shirt ofi.”
“Dunno”: Some shell-dazed Diggers who
dashed into matrimony on arriving in Eng-
land are already seeking their discharges.
But they’re finding it difficult to work their
tickets. For one thing, ground for divorce
in England is more circumscribed than in
many Australian States. For another, the
courts in England will not entertain juris-
diction in suits by soldiers not permanently
resident in Fogland. Consequently a few
Diggers are faced with an opportunity of
leisurely repentance. Most of the cases
are hinged on the discovery of the ladies’
lurid past and uncertain present. Another
variety is indicated by this letter:—
Dear Sir, —I have asked my wife several times to
come to Australia with me, but she turned it down.
I made inquiries with our Camp Commandant if he
could do anything to make her, but said he wouldn't
care to try. By getting married in this countrv 1
have made trouble with my family in Aussie. Now
she won’t come with me, and I would like to see if
you can help me to get a decree. I thought I
might get an advance from my deferred pay to buv
a divorce with. If you would see me alone I could
explain things better. —Yours faithfully, Dan .
I made inquiries on behalf of Dan and found
that a man in such a position is absolutely
at the mercy of his English missus. Should
she persist in remaining in England after
her hubhy’s departure for home she eventu-
NOT SO EASY.
PERCY: “What do you think of a man who will constantly [?] his wife?"
CIRCE: “I think he’s a wonder.”
ally becomes guilty of desertion. But that
isn’t a ground for divorce in the Cold Coun-
try. And. anyhow, the courts wouldn’t
entertain his suit if he weren’t domiciled in
England. Moreover, even if he climbed over
that difficulty by getting discharged from the
A.I.F. and becoming a citizen of the U.K.,
his grievance against his wife for. refusing
to live in Australia would automatically
disappear. You can't get a divorce from
your wife merely because she refuses to
accompany you on an ocean-picnic. If it
could be done shipping companies would be
amassing millions from bookings by married
men for passages to the Antarctic and other
places where the average wife would view
her prospects with uneasiness.
PUTTING HER TO THE TEST.
ONE: “Yes, in a battle of tongues a woman
can always hold her own.'"
THE OTHER : “Perhaps she can. But why
doesn't she?"
At a recent big Melbourne meeting one
speaker’s vanity was sorely hurt by the
contemptuous treatment he was receiving
from all parts of the house. Finally he thun-
dered : “I supposed this damned meeting to
be composed of rational human beings!”
“Sir,” retorted a citizen in a tone of stern
reproach, “you forget there are ladies pre-
sent.”
* # * *
“Jazz”: What arc we coming to'! When
Birdie gave away decorations in France it
was a formal affair, though his famous smile
used to rob (he ceremony of a good deal of
its stiffness. But to watch him do. the
same in England with the war over—well,
we’re going to the dogs, that’s what! The
other day, when he gave 600 Anzacs entitled
to it the 1014-15 ribbon at Headquarters,
London, he not only addressed each of them
with a few pleasant words, but shook hands
with ’em and said he hoped they’d live long
to wear it, or words to that effect. It so
knocked some of the Diggers off their perch
that they forgot to salute as they turned
away.
* * * #
“Ted C.”: While the Aussie has been the
admired of the English, to many of them
he has . also been a mystery. They never
can quite reconcile his notorious dislike for
the elocutionary guff and the parade-ground
flam that for so long passed as True Patriot-
ism and Good Soldiering with his grim
devotion to the Allied cause when it came
to a smack-up with Fritz. But the follow-
ing letter—not the first of its kind received
at A.I.F. Headquarters— may shed some
light on the matter, and perhaps pave the
way to a better understanding of our war-
aims :

IN THESE SERIOUS EPIDEMIC DAYS
Get CLEMENTS TONIC foryour Blood
Pure Blood means less risk of infection and greater powers of resistance to epidemic attacks.
The purer the blood the stronger the body. Epidemic disease thrives on the debilitated system.
These are anxious days for Australia, when it behoves all persons to take every care of themselves and ward off to their greatest
effort the menace to health that threatens them. No one can afford to take any undue risk, and the person who has the best condi-
tion of health and the greatest powers of resistance to any invading force, whether it .is epidemic disease, privation, oppressive
climatic conditions, worries, or minor illness, is best fortified against it. It is the old story in a new way of the soldier well armed;
he is shielded from attack of destructive and destroying forces. ,
Clements Tonic, which, for a quarter of a century, has been admitted a medicine of rare health value in keeping the nerves sound
and the blood cool and pure, should now' be used as a means to fortify the body and the general health. It tones up the stomach as
well, has a palliative effect on the bowels, stimulates the liver and kidneys, and imparts a healthy influence. Clements Tonic is
largely a blood and nerve medicine, and should be a part of the medical equipment of every home at the jjresent time.
Get it from your Chemist To-day. Use it as the Pure Blood Remedy.

The S. M. Herald is not very well
acquainted with its own parentage. In its
obituary notice of “Mr. James,” it said
that “in the early ’thirties the Sydney
Herald rose, phoenix-like, from the ashes
of the old Australian and the Monitor.”
As a matter of fact the Monitor kept go-
ing for years after the Herald was born.
It was not till Jan., 1843, in reviewing the
previous 12 months, that the Herald
reported that “the past year proved fatal
to four of our contemporaries.. .The Moni-
tor, having lost the master hand which had
from the first guided its affairs, had reached
the respectable age of 16 years when it
slept the sleep of death.” And the Aus-
tralian lived even longer, the last number
being published on September 28, 1848.

Australia grows claimants among other
raw products. The Tiehborne Claimant
wasn’t born here, but he started the indus-
try at Wagga (N.S.W.). He was after a
fortune of £40,000 a year, and he might
have got it but for the facts that he didn’t
know the language which the man he per-
sonated mostly used, or his mother’s name,
or anything in particular about him. and he
was the wrong size and age and religion and
appearance, and had his rightful initials
tattooed on his arm, and was hailed by too
many of his old humble acquaintances when
he went to London, and he couldn’t ex-
plain his long absence. George Leitch, the

actor, had a claim for most of the land on
which the city of Washington stands.
Leitch took it in a humorous spirit. There
had been a landowning ancestor on the site
before there was any city and there were
said to be grave doubts if he legally parted
with his selection. The actor didn’t invest
any money in grave doubts that dated back
to 1790, and when a firm of lawyers hunted
him up by letter and offered to take up his
case for a fee he told them to go ahead and
pay themselves liberally out of the pro-
perty. Then there was the Page Millions
claim, which had no connection with the
Millions Club, though it had its habitation
in Sydney. It concerned land in the city of
London, which an ancestor was said to
have owned but forgotten about, and which
was crying out for a proprietor. And the
other day Sydney Sun revived the industry
by finding the heiress, or one of them, to a
fortune of £3,000,000. The treasure consists of

land in Manchester, with factories and other
great properties on it, including “many
hotels.” The great-grandfather who acquired
it in 1820 died for some reason or
other, and the grandmother and the mother
who followed just couldn’t be bothered with
it. So unauthorised persons have presum-
ably been collecting the rents of the encum-
brance for the best part of a century. The
hour has at last come when these persons
will be shaken up.

“Wings”: When De Havilland, Handley-
Page, Curtiss and other big ’bus-designers
have got their air-liners
ready, all seasick travellers
can go world-tripping. The
air-sickness you’ve heard of
is mostly a myth. With a lot
of trouble, and encouraged
by Archies and machine-
gun s, I have made an
observer sick occasionally;
but the staid commercial
pilot won’t have a machine
sufficiently mobile for fool-
ing. Very few beginners,
even when learning stunts,
get sick, and the big ’buses
are devoid of all “lift” sen-
sation. For a time at any
rate we shall also be rid of
that other nightmare of the
traveller, the ship’s bore.
The most irrepressible speci-
men will find it hard to beat
the whir of the blades, the purr of the
engine and the roar of the disturbed air.

“’Erb”: The Diggers have won another
victory. It started with the partial absorp-
tion of the A.I.F. in the Royal Air Force;
and presently old Joe T. found himself the
only Australian in the Tommy unit. He
was in the cook-house. Sgt. Guffer. secre-
tary of the non.-corns.’ mess, had been in the
habit of getting extras from the cook-house
on behalf of his brother three-stripes, to the
detriment, of course, of the plain Tommies.
The solitary Digger said it must stop. The
sergeant retaliated for this very proper atti-
tude by telling Joe T. that he was “dirty—
like all Australians.” Joe T. knocked him
down for the honor of his country, and got.
IS months for it. Then the usual gross
breach of discipline for which Diggers are
famous happened: a round robin was signed
and sent to the G.O.C. It ran this way :
We consider that the punishment awarded is
excessive in the extreme and far beyond what is
necessary for the maintenance of discipline, if indeed
it be at all necessary to support a sergeant in an
illegal attempt to force a subordinate to steal the
men’s rations for the use of sergeants.
Nothing, however, was done; and then vari-
ous Digger officers were told of the facts
and were informed that it was time some-
thing was done. They, of course, passed
the word on; and from Imperial Head-
ouarters (which has the administration of
Military Prisons) a report arrived, begin-
ning: “The facts alleged in the round robin
appear to be in the main accurate!” It
went on to point out what a dreadful thing
a round robin is—subversive of discipline
and so on—the senior man signing it is
liable to something with boiling in it—but
in view of the facts Joe T. would be re-
leased if his conduct in gaol had been good.
That point having been cleared up, Joe T.
was released; and another score went up
'for the Digger against the unholy military
system.
“Johnno”: Amongst other poor jokes
which the Bananaland Government inflicts
on the taxpayer is the yacht which decorates
the seascape at Thurs-
day Island for the use
of the Protector of
Aborigines when visit-
ing the island and
mainland stations, and
for connecting the
Government teachers
in the islands with
civilisation. Recently

urged the acquiring of
a larger and more
suitable boat. The
ketch cannot at pre-
sent be used until the
sanction of the Bris-
bane redtapers has
been obtained, and
when, after much in-
terchange of tele-
grams, the requisite
permission comes
along, there is hardly
room in the boat to
swing a cat. When

blem of where to put

teachers a better deal,
and not expect them
to rely on casual fish-
ing-luggers or beche-de-mer boats.
“Bloore”: I salaam twice to the learned
person who states (B. 20/3/’l9) that
“India was a disappointment in the war.”
Generally speaking, it was a costly nui-
sance. Its labor battalions in France were
a ghastly failure, and the Ghurkas —the
gentlemen with the curved butchers’ cleavers
—are much over-boomed as fighters. I rise
to order, however, when the writer asserts
that Ram Curry and Co. were largely re-
sponsible for the “one lamentable surrender
which a British force made in the war,”
referring, of course, to Kut-el-Amara.
Townsend surrendered because there was
nothing else to do. At the time Kut was
bottled up the 6th Indian Division con-
sisted of about 6000 Indians and 2SOO
white troops (Dorsets. Leicesters and a
sprinkling of other county regiments).
Townsend received repeated assurances
that relieving forces would reach him; yet
for five heart-breaking months no help came
to his sorely-tried garrison except numerous
“notes” from Brass Ilats in London asking
him to “hang on” —which he did to the ulti-
mate ounce of horse-flesh. The sickness was
appalling in the last few weeks, and this
had more to do with the surrender than
anything else. The Indian certainly played
his part equally with the Tommies. I know
the Indian from the Bombay bazaars, as
well as the orange-whiskered gentleman
from the frontier, and, believe me, the lat-
ter can make things fly when he is bejserk.
He stands a lot of bounce from Tommy
Atkins, but in a “rough house” he is quite
a dependable sort.

In an appeal in divorce the other day, the
High Court in Melbourne declared that there
could be no desertion without departure.
The applicant for a decree admitted that,
though respondent had left his bed, she had
not deserted his board. She remained
around the house, performing the duties of
a servant, but declined to be a wife. This
being so, the Court ruled against the hus-
band ; and now all men may know that a
coldness between the parties is not sufficient
—there must be distance or there is no deser-
tion. What the Court did not say was what
distance amounted to desertion in the eye of
the Law. If the lady stayed just over the
back fence, would that be legal desertion,
qualifying a neglected husband to get his
divorce ?

region. The line is 32 miles long and for

an ample living for a working family. Most
of it is now merely used for grazing. Re-

dence, in view of the fact that the epidemic may yet
reach us in more severe form.”
—Joyous lament of a parson.
Lei us, with a gladsome mind,
Praise the Lord, for lie is kind!
Microbc-’s sting and doctor’s cure
Still are faithful, still are sure.
Little sneezes come and go;
Merry winter winds shall blow.
Keep the hypodermic near
For the time o 1 sin. and fear.
While the sun shines let us bask.
We may smother ’neath a mask
To the Health Department’s tune
All the merry month of June.
Keep on hoping. Germs shall yet
Crawl along the pavements wet.
They shall dance and they shall float,
Grabbing at our nose and throat.
Let us therefore warble out
Praise and warning, turn about;
For the Lord has yet to brew
Some more awful kind of ’flu!
N'.S.W.
OURSE O’ MOSES.


The Three Art Features
of the Year:-
“Art in Australia ” —(being reproductions in color of the principal pictures
of the leading Australian Art’sts).
“The Art of J. J. Hilder” —a collection of reproductions in color of this
Artist’s work —and
“Arthur Streeton’s Water Colors” —this latter being now in the press.
All Art lovers should secure copies of these publications, because art cannot live without
patronage any more than a tradesman can exist without customers. The educative value of
these reproductions is inestimable, as not one in a thousand is able to visit the exhibitions of
these pictures ; but by means of these wonderfully reproduced “miniatures of art the whole
community is able to watch the development in its very midst of the artistic temperament
without which those fine thoughts and aspirations which “ make for righteousness in a nation
would die inarticulate.
But back of Art must be commercial enterprise. What makes it possible for all these
Australian Artists to address this larger community is the existence of the necessary skill,
business acumen, and materials for the perfect reproductions of the Artist dreams.
And what was one of their Biggest Problems ?
Why, Paper, of course!
The ancient Israelites could not make Pharaoh’s
bricks without straw —nor could this highest
product of the Printer’s Art be possible with-
out suitable Paper. It had to be of good
strength, fine texture, high finish and bright
color. Well those concerned found Warren’s
Standard Printing Paper to be all that —and
more.
The Editors —Messrs. Sydney Ure Smith and
Bertram Stevens —say: “Those who cannot
see the originals are able to get as near perfec-
tion as possible in the reproductions on Warren’s
Standard.”
The Publishers —Messrs. Angus & Robertson,
Ltd., report —“ Those who have bought copies
of the two so far published are so universally
satisfied, that the works must be all we claim
for them, and the paper all you say it is.”
Your Printer has stocks, or can procure from
B. J. BALL, Ltd., Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne
SOLE AGENTS FOR:
The Printer, Mr. Arthur McQuitty, says-~“My
printing difficulties were reduced to a minimum
by the use of Warren's Cumberland Art.”
The Block Makers, Messrs. Hartland & Hyde,
say —“The fine screen necessary for work of
this character was admirably reproduced on
Warren’s Standard Paper.”
If this Warren Standard Printing Paper is so
satisfactory for this most exacting class of work
—what about trying it for your next catalogue,
circular, folder or other piece of printed matter ?
The Standard Grades are: —
Warren’s Cumberland M.F. and Super
Warren’s Cumberland Coated
Warren town and Lustro Art Papers
Printone Imitation Art
Library Text (Special M.F.)
Warren’s Silkote Dull Art
Warren’s Olde Style—(Antique Finish)
Cameo Plate Coated, Covers and Postcard
Boards. (Sepia and Ivory Tints).

IF BILIOUS OR CONSTIPATED TAKE
CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
Harmless fruit laxative cleanses
stomach, liver and bowels
without griping or
discomfort.
An acid stomach, clogged with fermenting,
ill-digested food, means that the liver is not
doing its duty. Nature provided ripe fruit
juices to keep the liver up to its- work.
California Syrup of Figs—“Califig”—is a
deliciously refreshing fruit laxative which is
always in season. You can keep it at hand,
and it will be an unfailing friend whenever
the tongue is coated, bowels sluggish, breath
foul, throat dry or sore, stomach full of
wind, and head hot and aching. You can
take a dose whenever it is needed, as safely
as you could eat fresh fruit. In a short
while you will feel the benefit. The bowels
will be gently relieved, and the stomach
cleansed and sweetened as the undigested
food is moved on and got rid of. The tongue
will grow clean again and the head will be
cooled and cleared. There is no mistaking
the beneficial effects of California Syrup of
Figs—“Califig.” Directions are with it for
adults and children of all ages. This
pleasant laxative is good for all, and cannot
possibly harm even the most delicate, but
you must ask for “Califig”—California
Syrup of Figs, and look for the name and
trade-mark of the California Fig Syrup Co
All chemists sell “Califig”—California Syrup
of Figs—in two sizes, 1/6 and 2/4. * £1

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Jap talks about, racial equality. We
won’t quarrel' about racial equality if he
will concede racial difference.
Brussels has already put in a claim to be
the capital of the League of Nations. Un-
less Hughes hurries up poor old Canberra
may be left again.
The Federal Government offers £lO.OOO
for the first successful flight from Britain
to Australia on an airship manned by
Australians. Much better offer £25,000
for the first flight from Australia to
Britain on an airship manned and built
by Australians. Instead of offering £lO.OOO
for the importation of an airship there
should be a duty put on it. Further, this
country should be dead tired of being dis-
covered by caravals, galleons, junks, brigs
and steamers. Instead of England discov-
ering it by airship it should discover Eng-
land for a change.
The Peace Conference keeps piling up
awkward precedents. The old Polish sea-
port of Dantzic might probably decide, on a
vote, to be Prussian instead of Polish ; but
it has been resolved that the Hun majority,
if there is one, doesn’t count, because it has
been artificially created by the Hun Govern-
ment, which drove out Poles to make way for
Huns. Also there is to be no plebiscite in
Alsace-Lorraine, because the Hun vote there
is the vote of Hun intruders settled in the
country to keep down the natives. Now
what about the north-east corner of Ulster?
Statistician Knibbs has computed, evi-
dently for the information of Bolsheviks,
that if all Australian incomes in excess of
£3OO a year were relinquished by those in
receipt of them and were distributed amongst
the population, the loot would provide a sum
of 3s. Id. a week each. Even if only the excess
of £5OOO a year were collared from those whose
incomes are above that sum, and were equally
divided amongst the population, we should
all of us have an extra SJd. a week apiece.
It is to be hoped that the Australian
Labor Party at the Easter Conference will
knock out the whole rotten system of selec-
tion ballots. The average strength of a
Labor League is about 150, and under rule
0 this number can he easily swamped by
almost any affiliated union. In South Syd-
ney alone there are probably enough bottle-
blowers to run the whole show in that
area, State and Federal. Apart from this
rule, consider what (say) 30 energetic pub-
licans could do, with packing material lying
around that would go whichever way the
beer blew! The A.L.P. needs reminding
that under Proportional Representation it
matters not how many party candidates are
run; the votes ultimately concentrate upon
the most acceptable men, as indicated by
votes, until by process of elimination each
party is represented in Parliament in
accordance with its strength without.
THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN.
WATT : “ What’s all this clamor?”
AUSTRALIA: “These are our infant industries claiming the right to tive."
From the Old Gallery Hand: —
Hughes is expected back for the re-opening of
Parliament in June, and will try to re-establish the
illusion of the Indispensable. He will have a task
demanding all his courage and tenacity, for his
prestige has been shaken by various events in Lon-
don, and a big section of the party frankly prefers
Vv att. But Watt disclaims any intention of ejecting
his chief from the tart-shop. With the air of a
man whose greatest political ambition has been
satisfied, he proposes to put himself in his former
modest niche in the Cabinet and help Hughes with
his ’umble counsel as before. Seemingly nothing can
change this attitude in Watt. Even if Hughes were
eventually sacked for his sins, the party would
need all its power of compulsion to make the other
■Willie fill the vacancy.
The profiteer doesn’t miss many chances.
Lately the N. S. Wales Government, with a
hot election fight ahead, sent a relief man to
a mining town where distress was threat-
ened to distribute food coupons. Without a
blush certain local traders promptly rushed
up the prices of stuff supplied in return for
coupons, on the ground that they might have
to wait a while to collect the cash from the
Government. The other fact that there
would be no bad debts didn’t matter. And
the coupon-holders didn’t care much because
they got the. tickets for nothing, wdiieh is
very cheap.
It is characteristic of Queensland, with the
biggest proportion of Hun and Slav popu-
lation among the States, that the latest big
railway shindy is about the re-instatement
of Rheingold, who seems to have lost his
job.
If the records are correct the United
States has now 3,645,919 tons of shipping
under construction, while the whole British
Umpire, Japan, Holland, Italy, Sweden,
Spain, Denmark, Norway and Prance among
them are building 3,251,132 tons. Thai
looks very like a challenge to the lady who
shows through her clothes on the hinder side
of the old British penny—the lady who sits
on the edge of a cartwheel and holds up a
big fork to amuse a lighthouse.
The usual Peace Conference item:—
The Council did not meet on Tuesday, which was
taken up in conversations between President Wilson,
Mr. Lloyd George and M. Clernenceau.
Meanwhile the representatives of the other
two great Allied Powers, Italy and Japan,
either listen at the keyhole or else gnash
their teeth at the window. The five small
Allies who were up to their necks in the
fight sit in a row on the fence. It is all
very good for Lloyd George and Clernen-
ceau, who were trained in the old diplomacy,
but Wilson, who abhorred secrecy, seems
out of place in this hole-and-corner busi-
ness.
From the inside :■ —
Apropos recent correspondents. Don’t believe it—-
Holman has no friendship for Carmichael. He might
appear to have, for policy sake, the while Car. can,
with some show, play the role of hero. The trouble
is an old one. When Carmike threw away his port-
folio he straightway bent his energies upon unhorsing,
his old chief. To the friendly he whispered: “Get
brilliant Billy away to England—-his mind' is failing.’’
T.o the militant section, he said: “We must get him
out he’s holding us back.” He it was who moved
a resolution in Parliament to take a referendum on
the matter of early pub-closing, the while the wily
Premier was endeavoring to save the liquor inter-
ests, the consideration being their support of his
teetotal pal Davie Hall. The offering of the Irriga-
tion Commissionership (with a string tied to it) was
sheer circus, and had the desired effect upon the
public mind. Many stunts of this kind well-remem-
bered by old Laborites, and his “dying rock-chopper”
and “rich-baker” yarns not forgotten by old Liberals,
will, clog his feet in his next clamber after promi-
nence.
A married man with five children wrote
to a daily paper last week about “the clutch
of the landlord” because the rent had been
raised from 14s. to 17s. fid. per week. For
a family of that size the clutch of the land-
lord who owns Australia—he who gathers
the interest on the public debt—runs to 14s.
Gd a week. And fully half of it. being
paid to a foreign landlord, is free from ali
taxation here, in addition to being spent
abroad, so that, it doesn’t by any chance
come back in Wages to a harried man with
live children. Taking the average of 3G
principal towns the landlord we see—the
Monday morning man—put up his rents
per cent, in six years, though some of the
big towns were much worse than that. He
said it was partly through increased cost of
repairs. The landlord we don’t see—the
half-yearly man who owns and collects from
all Australia—put up his rent by rather
over 11 per cent., without doing any repairs.
He simply increased his charge every time
the lease ( i.e ., the loan) fell due. Worried
men with an indefinite number of children
who can’t see more than a nose-length ahead
never realise that there is any landlord un-
less he calls personally with a book.
Canon Nelson, who died the other day In
Auckland (M.L. 1, had been incumbent of
one church—St. Paul’s—for nearly 38 years.
Catkin : O.C.’s in France had to ascer-
tain, lately, where their men proposed to
go on their return. One Digger, fed up
with the delay m demobilisation, answered
briefly: “Liverpool Old Men’s Home.”
Ihe Broken Hill Miners’ Association
absolutely repudiates the policy of com-
pulsory arbitration.” In pther words, the
community has no claims on them or anv
other body of workers. Civilisation is a
complex machine; and the Broken Hill
minors assort tho right of overy whool-
barrow to block the traffic whenever it feels
so disposed.
When Mrs. Jennie Baynes, of Melbourne,
decided to “do’ six months rather than give
a bond for good behavior—she had been
waving the Red Rag on Yarra Bank—she
knew what would happen. Leaving the
court ,she assured it that she would “hunger
strike ’ her way to freedom in a week, and
in four days the Law opened the gates and
told the prospective corpse to get outside.
In this matter the Law showed itself the
old ass. Either it should have withered
Mrs. Baynes with cold disregard and not
arrested her, or she should have been given
a cup of milk for breakfast, a basin of broth
for lunch and another of thin gruel for tea.
She might lose a little flesh, but she would
be years reaching the cemetery on such
nourishment. And the individual with a
strong enough will to refuse to drink hasn’t
been discovered yet.
Governments are not always as slow as
they are alleged to be. Recently it was
announced that a N. S. Wales mining town
would soon be in trouble owing to stoppage
°' : work at the local big shows; and before
the men were paid off a Government relief
officer was on the spot arranging with local
celebrities fob the distribution of food
coupons.
Lie. “Nationalist” organisations propose
to try to get in out of the wet at a con-
ference in Melbourne this month. The word
is being passed round that the only way to
scotch 0.8. U.-ism and the like is to frame
a sane and safe Radical programme. The
Tories know it, but are making wry faces,
all the same.
t Tim position is that Storey, leader of the
N.S.W . Labor party, repudiates Bolshevism
with all his heart and soul. Brookfield, a
member of his party, advocates Bolshevism
with all his heart and soul. And the party
doesn’t throw either of them out, as it did
Holman and others over the compulsory
service question, but reserves tbe right to
jump either way.
From a man in Petrograd known to The
Bulletin for many years:—
Czar ism was never so sweeping in its violence as
the present Bolshevik • regime. Almost everybody
with any pretensions to “birth” or education has
been slain, imprisoned or silenced, and the nationals
of Entente countries hhve been seized and,' their
most negotiable treasures “nationalised.” The lust
for plunder is aggravated by the fact that the great
majority of the Commissaries are Jews who have
won their place through their ingenious savagery or
the influence of their fellow Hebrew, Trotzky. Prisons
and fortresses are overflowing with crushed bour-
geoisie, aristocrats, ex-army officers, and “revolu-
tionaries who have refused to bolshe with the
necessary vehemence. The old fortress -of Peter
and Paul, now commanded by a Lettish illiterate,
is almost bulging with starved and diseased human-
ity. In a cell in one of the upper bastipns, 20 feet
bv 10 feet and about 8 feet high, 20 persons, in-
cluding five Englishmen, recently spent several
weeks. During the times of Czar Nicholas that cell
was the home of one person, but the Bolshevik re-
gards that ratio of confinement as absurdly luxurious
for a bourgeoisie or a noble. The 20 went foodless
for two days and were only allowed out for a few
minutes each day for exercise in the corridor. The
five Britons, four of whom were newspaper men,
were dragged out of the English Consulate by the
scruff of the neck, but through the intervention of
the Dutch Minister were subsequently released. The
remaining 15, Russian officers, were taken, osten-
sibly bound for Cronstadt, but on the way the majority
were tied into bundles of two with barbed wire
and shot into the sea. The remainder were suffo-
cated in the dungeons of Cronstadt.
THE HOME-COMING,
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Four summers since, in a waning year,
You marshalled ug, eager to save mankind.
Do you recall? Is the vision clear,
The sequence plain in your ordered mind ?
We have weltered and plodded and dug and bled,
Labored, with sweat and our wounds for fee,
That the little lands should be freed (you said),
And tiie world made safe for -democracy 1
We have fought your light; you have said your say—
There in a bill to pay !
Leader and servant, through blood and doubt,
Striving (you told us) should win to light,
And the gristing of gladness would issue out
From the mills of the Master that grind aright.
Gain we should garner from grief and loss,
Help would be near when the poor man cried,
Fire of battle should purge our dross,
And the seed of the lowly be justified.
These were your words! If your words were true,
What do you mean to do ?
Docile and drilled in the ancient ways,
Lightly unquestioning, simply true,
We have fought (how' we fought!) for a flag, a
phrase,
Tlie seeming of Right, and a king or two.
You said (you remember) that afterward
’! he song of the world, in a sweet, new chime,
Should smother the dissonance evil-starred
That lived in the old, sad, bitter time.
Masters, we grieve if we do you wrong—.
Bui the waiting is overlong!
We can tarry awhile, who were ever used
To waiting till hope in the heart grew sick ;
Yet power that is laggard is power abused—
And the clouds in the northern sky hang thick.
A wine that we knew not has poured, and passed
To fire in the blood of the world of men—
A strangeness and newness that waxes fast
Nor ever will wane or be stilled again.
Twere better, perchance, to recall to-day
The pledges we bore away.
Mas there a meaning upon your tongue
More than the clamor of hawk-scared birds—■
Fruit in the tree of your promise hung,
Dawn in the heart of your cloud of words?
There is a lesson that, writ in fire,
The school of our warring and working showed—
A way to the goal of a man’s desire,
A shorter, a sterner, a truer road :
Read it, and then, for your own sweet sake,
Cling to your word —or break!
Me have walked in the darkness where Terror lives;
The ranks of our muster are gapped and thin ;
Fling us- (we earned it) what honor gives
For the worth of your word and our trust therein.
There is never a need for a man to crave
Who has learned of a way that a man may take;
Yet pay, for the faith that a day may save,
For your pride and our own, and the land's fair
sake!
Was it, my masters, but sham and, show
You mouthed, four years ago?
VICTORIA.

QUICKLY SOOTHES NERVES.
MAKES THEM STEADY AND STRONG.
During and after a period of intense ner-
vous strain there is a demand for sedatives
and stimulants—something to soothe the
nerves, brace them up, and make them
strong and steady again. It would be im-
possible to enumerate all the things that
are tried with these objects in view, but it
is a well-known fact that bitro-phosphate
produces better results in less time than
ordinary sedative and stimulants. More-
over, this method of treatment is commended
because it is recognised that bitro-phosphate
does not produce ill-effect and no reaction
follows its use. This establishes it as a
safe' and reliable specific for use in cases o,f
neurasthenia, nervousness, depression, debil-
ity,'etc., and it is certain that as sufferers
come to realise its efficacy they will discard
drugs and artificial stimulants and take
bitro-phosphate instead. One tablet immedi-
ately after every meal is the dose usually
recommended, and as the tablets can now be
purchased quite cheaply from practically all
high-class chemists the treatment is within
the easy reach of every one who needs it

“Machete”: There’s no doubt at all about
crocodiles travelling overland. In seasons when the'
small lagoons dry up, North Queensland instances
ire common. Sometimes crocs, seem to do the journey
for the sake of the exercise or the scenery. He will
often go a long way from the domestic waterhole to
find tucker. An old N.Q. friend one night went to
investigate a hullabaloo in his duckyard, a sapling
enclosure about half a mule from any water in which
a respectable crocodile would hire a flat. As he
reached the enclosure something rushed between his
legs and he was carried along several yards before he
could disentangle himself. The tracks next morning
put the character of the visitor beyond all doubt
They also accounted for the absence of some
muscovies.
* * * *
“Suburbaneer”: Sydney suburbs have ac-
quired a type of weak-hearted mouse that falls dead
when a wire-trap snaps just in front of his whiskers.
I have killed two of the cowardly breed within a
week, and a neighbor about a mile away has several
to his credit. In no case had the trap caught any
part of the deceased’s body. The fainthearts look
like the ordinary house-mouse of commerce.
Doyle” (from London) : The discussion
about the possibilities of transplanting Sturt’s desert-
pea reminds me of the splendid blooms of the purple-
eyed red. variety to be seen hanging in showers from
baskets in one o f the Kew (England) hothouses each
summer. In the same court are eucalypts, Moret.on
Bay figs (in pots), several varieties of our boronias,
“tick bush,’’ etc. Last February the canteen tables
of the women s staff at Headquarters, Horseferry-
road, were decorated with pots of red boronia, bought
at Covent Garden for a shilling each. They were
splendid specimens from the south of France.
“I Say”: If the Australian black and
bvown snakes belong to the same family as the
Indian cobra, how about trying this treatment, from
“Asiatic Dissertations,” by John Williams? The
cases quoted, he says, were within his own knowledge.
The wife of one of his servants was bitten by a
cobra de capello. In a few minutes she became
convulsed, particularly about the jaws and throat,
with gnashing of teeth. No ligature was applied,
but about 60 drops of volatile caustic alkali spirit
were given in water, and in about seven minutes the
dose was repeated, when the convulsions left her, and
in three more minutes she became sensible and spoke
to those about her. A few drops of the spirit had also
been applied to the wound. Another case was that
of a woman who became speechless, with locked jaws
and profuse discharge of saliva from the mouth.
She was given about a teaspoonful of spirit in water,
while some was applied to the wound, the dose being
repeated in a few minutes. This patient had quite
reedvered in half an hour. Williams relates several
other cases, and states that he never knew an instance
of the volatile caustic alkali failing in its effect
where the patient had been able to swallow it.
“W. Water”: They have some cheerful
names about Kerang (Vic.). Close by Deadman's
Hollow is Murdering Lake, which is alleged to take
its name from the killing of two stockmen by the
blackfellows in the overlanding days. The yarn is
that the stockmen were held under water until they
died.

“Veronal”: Re “Bart’s” albino waratah
(B. 27/2/’]9). I have struck numerous native-flower
fieaks, such as pink candia (false sarsaparilla), the
usual color of the blossom being bright blue. Also
clumps of “wild mignonette”—an unfragrant plant
resembling the garden variety—which had white
flowers instead of pale brown. This herb, by the
way,, is gifted with a rotten smell which “ even
deceives the foraging blowfly. Another oddity, of
fungoid nature, and also, evidently, of carnivorous
habit, has a trumpet-shaped flow'er, carbuncle-red in
coloring. Small flies and gnats, attracted bv the
perfume, which closely resembles that of putrid
flesh, enter the cup, which eventually closes. Then
the Plant dines on their juices. It grows beside
decaying logs in damp gullies chiefly, but I have
found it also in the' rich, moist soil of a disused
piggery. In an old orchard of mildewed and blight-
strieken quince and apple trees I’ve struck queer
fruits which were half apple and half quince—a case
of cross fertilisation surely, not Burbanked mon-
strosities.

Steve Hart”: Reflecting on the length of
time that bunny can go between drinks, 1 recall a
place on the Lachlan where a large warren was
thoroughly netted in. There was no grass or water
VV *. " rnclosure , and only a few box saplings,
which the cotton-tails could climb like ’possums.
- hey existed on the leaves and bark for 10 months,
but they did not breed. The boss thought to finish
them off with some phosphorised pollard, but they
wouldnt look at it, nor was strychnine and wheat
any more attractive. But a wooden trough filled
with water and doped with arsenic did the trick
A DESIRABLE JOB.
GRANDMA COHEN: “Now, Ikey, why did David say he would rather he a door-

LITTLE IKEY: “So’s he could walk about outside while the Rabbi was preachin'. ”
“Gouger”: There are moments in a man’s
life when he doesn’t want to be alone. Here’s one
of ’em. I was following up the boys in a dinghy,
while they dived for b6che-de-mer. Chewing up
some cocoanut, I squirted it over the side of the
boat. Straight away the oily stuff stilled the
ripples on the water, and I could plainly see the
bottom. In towards the coral some shadowy sea-
plant with waving tendrils was slowly swinging
with the tide. Near this plant were lying some
THE TEST.
GROGAN (of the opposition pub): “Clear out of it! Clear out! D'ye hear me? Afther
spending your money at Ryan’s ye’ll not come spongin' on me.”
JOHNNY: “ Baal Rogan’s pub! Missa Ryan 's pub—budgeree stuff that one! Keep you
drunk one plurry wcek.”
of the big sea-slugs we were after. Thinking I
might as well help to swell the day’s catch. I
slipped overboard and dived down. I caught two
slugs, and was turning upward when something soft
touched my leg. Giving a slight kick I started
upward, suspecting nothing. Great was my sur-
prise, while still swimming up, to feel the soft
plant still clinging to my leg. I tried to brush it
off with the - other leg, only to find that a similar
tendril had entwined itself about both legs. A bit
alarmed, I pushed vigorously towards the surface,
to find that stretching elastic-bands held me and
that the higher I went the tauter grew the bands.
Now thoroughly alarmed, I dropped both the slugs,
and struck out with all my strength for the surface,
now only a few feet above. First I gained a little
and could see the bright blue sky shining through
the water just overhead. Then something soft, very
soft, crept round my neck, grew taut, and exerted
a steady downward pull. The surface water had
turned to an inky black. Continuing my struggle,
suddenly I shot up like a rocket, clear out of the
water, into fragrant air and dazzling sunlight. The
bovg had dived down among the coral, and cut the
strangling tendrils with their sheath-knives.
“Riverina” : At last it looks as if Maori-
land runholders start a grand offensive against the
kea. Hitherto the bird has confined its murders to
the higher country; but recently it has been coming
lower, till now it operates grues’omely on sheep on
the lower levels, and even on the plains. Like the
emu its inquisitiveness makes it an easy “kill.” A
friend of mine, noticing a flock, tied a red handker-
chief to a stick, sat behind a rock, and waved it
gently the hanky, not the rock. Along came the
birds to investigate. The leader approached so
close that he got outed with the stick. Keas will
work right through the night on yarded sheep. On
a Lake Wakati pu run a massacre took place one
night, and in the morning a dozen or more splendid
wethers were dead or dying. The bird is some-
thing of a sheep-classer, and picks out the fattest.
“Bill R.”: You never know where a bullet
is going to finish its sprint. Once saw a round ball
fired from a muzzle-loader gun at a native hear in
a tree. The lead ploughed a track across the
shooter's shoulder and then burrowed into a log
behind him. It had struck a hard knot on the tree’
and rebounded. At Queanbeyan (N.S.W.) two hunt-
ers were after wallabies, one driving over the ridges
to the other. The stationed man fired at a long-tail
loping down the gully and killed his mate on the
other side of the hill. The bullet had first ricocheted
from a rock, flying upwards, and had then glanced
downwards from a tree on top of the rise
K. W. McH.”: “Paul Cupid’s” experi-
ence with water in the ear of a jibbing horse (B.
27/2/ 19) reminds me of a similar experiment with
a stubborn army mule on the Somme. It was one
of a team of six engaged in the withdrawal of a gun.
Ihe job was undertaken at night, and, owing to the
numbei of shell holes and the half-frozen mud border-

injr them, little progress was made in the journey of
300 yards from the position to the corduroy road.
At midnight the near centre mule turned the job in
by lying down with that half-closed-eye expression
which in a mule denotes “Finis.” We coaxed it,
belted, cursed and shouted at it, with no result. Then
some Digger suggested putting a splinter of ice
down its sleeve-like ear. We slipped in a piece about
four inches long, and held our breaths and the donk’s
reins while we awaited the result. The donk stuck
it for a minute, then thoughtfully gave his head a
nod to one side like a pantomime moke and flicked
the ice into a shellholc four yards away. He didn't
get up until we had unhooked the team. You can’t
kid a mule.

“Yanaway”: Bill Slieepdip, all the w.ay
fj om Bananaland, was due to visit his old friends the
Rr.bbittraps at Royal Park (Vic.). The ex-bush
family wrote him a letter of welcome, and told him
to “Get on a tram—you can’t miss it.” On the
appointed evening Bill failed to turn up for tea. At
nine o’clock a weary William arrived, at the house.
“Where did ycr get ter?” they shouted. “Yer told

“E.M.W.”: Please tell “Black Swan” (B.
11*) that I am not mixed in my assertions
about the mole-cricket. I was born on the banks of
the Swan River, and from the time I could crawl l
dug mole-crickets out of the tracks in the sand. The
crickets were still there when I left three years ago.
Mole-crickets appeared in the Inverell (N.S.W.) dis-
trict about, a month back—-no doubt on account of
the drought. Recent heavy rains have probably
drowned them all by now.
Me’: Ever see a nail-less house? One
up on the N. S. Wales North Coast was built by an
old timber-getter who considered that nails spoiled
timber, and that neither a wooden floor nor an iron
roof contributed to man’s well-being. His borne
was substantial and comfortable, with walls of
bloodwood, smooth as your best girl’s cheek, and held
in place above and below by double plates fitted into
mortise-holes in the corner posts. Stringy-bark
formed the roof, and its position was maintained
with saplings strung on No. 8 fencing-wire, and
braced to the wall-plates with the same material.
The doors and windows, mortised and dovetailed,
swung between crosspieces, bored top and bottom
to admit the axis. Ant-heap cement, hard as old
Nick’s forehead but much smopther, served for the
floor. Its hardness worried the lady of the house,
so the old man put down a box-tree bark carpet.

This life’s a riddle-me, riddle-me-ree,
As lons' as the eyes' of a man can see;
And the day that he guesses the answer to one
The Fates give a smile and another’s begun.
And the day that he guesses the answer to that
Another is tossed in his poor old hat;
And, whether they help him to good or to harm,
In guessing these riddles is all the charm.
A riddle is Birth and the Cradle-song,
A riddle is Right and a riddle is Wrong ;

Right down to the day when your mouth is dust.

HORSE CLIPPING!
All Horses should be dipped in the Autumn and Winter.
The
The above two statements stand unquestioned to-day throughout the world.
It has become an international practice amongst horse-owners to clip horses in the autumn
and the winter. It is acknowledged by all that the clipping of the horse in both the autumn and
the spring improves his usefulness, keeps him in better health, enables him to do more work and
prolongs his life. From a humane standpoint alone, every horse should have his heavy coat of
hair rembved in the autumn and winter.
The preference for Stewart Horse-clipping Machines has steadily grown during the past
vears until to-day it represents more than 90 per cent, of all horse-clipping machines in use. It
was used for clipping Army horses during the war by the Australian Government and all the Allied
armies. There are many reasons for this world-wide prestige of the Stewart Horse-clippmg
Machine.
The Patented Single Tension Sliding Bar Clipping Head
alone is worth more than the entire price of any clipping-machine made. For smooth running \
and perfect cutting results nothing lias ever been made that will approach it. It is a perfect |
principle perfectly applied. |
All Gears are Cut from a Solid Steel Bar.
They are hardened file hard and run constantly in a bath of oil in a dust-proof enclosed gear-case.

“Ne’er-do-Weel”: “FY7” suggests (IJ.
27/2/’l9) that “Gouger” should muster and drove
wild pigs to market. Sounds all right, but there
are drawbacks. 1 r-member the experiment on the
Baloime mentioned by “FY7.” It happened before
J. C. Higginson, general manager of the A. P. Co.,
and prince of sportsmen and good fellows, initiated
pig-sticking and big pig-drives—the A.P. Co.’s runs
were infested with swine. The old chap who tried
the experiment—l cannot remember bis name for
the moment—went to an infinity of trouble, for wild
pigs are the very mischief to muster and yard. He was
a wily old bird and built his mustering yard in
swampy ground, ground-baiting it, so to speak, with
whole-corn trodden in. That kept the porcines busy
rooting in the mud as they were brought in. When
he started on the road he elaborated the com idea,
spreading a widely- but thinly-scattered trail from
swamp camp to, swamp camp. However, notwith-
standing all his trouble, the venture was not a pay-
ing one. lie lost more than he marketed, and no
one ever tried a second experiment. His principal
customers were cockles (there were not very many
of them), boundary-riders and so on; but they soon
learned that the wild pig does not thrive in cap-
tivity. I lived for some time on Gulnarber, and
we tried to rear wild suckers in the pig-pens, but
they were not a success. At the same time, a wild
sucker, killed and eaten promptly, makes a feed
not to be despised.
“Sgt. S.” : Has any Abo. reader used this
method of starting a jib? 1 saw it tried on a
Tommy A.S.C". team stuck in tie sand behind the
Y.M. at E tuples. The driver and his mate were
beside the team looking as miserable as only a
Tommy can look, when two Diggers came along and,
without question, ordered the Woodbines to get back
on to the seat. “It’s no good, choom,” said the
driver, “we always have to wait for them.” But
they got back, having had some experience of the
Diggers’ methods. The Diggers fell in, one each
side of the team, and just as though they were drilled
to it picked up a handful of sand each. Then, lifting
the nags’ tails to one side, they dashed in the sand.
Immediately the team was seized with convulsions,
and with a snort and a bound were off with two very
much alarmed representatives of the Imperial army
trying to steer them clear of the Eggs-a-Cook camp.
ALL IS NOT LOST.
At the quarterly meeting of the Colac auxiliary
of the British and Foreign Bible Society a letter
was received from the central office, Melbourne,
offering to present the burnt-out settlers a copy of
the Bible. It was decided to instruct the secre-
tary to write acknowledging the offer, and to ask
for 100 Bibles.
HARRY (a wilful optimist, to father, a
burnt-out farmer): “Buck up, Dad,
we’ll knock a Bible out of it, any-
way!”
“Te Whare”: Recent great floods in the
Boga (N.S.W.) rivers gave many snakes—black,
brown and tiger, chief!}' —their quietus. But many
of the squirmers, still lively, were seen crawling
about on the mud-crusts which permeate the cow-
country at present. A snake takes some drowning.
I observed the same thing years ago after a flood in
the serpent-haunted McLaughlin liiver, in southern

elongated -devils aren’t nice to tackle with a stick.
A jscattery gun is the best weapon. As regards the
whip-snake, which isn’t highly poisonous, I have
sometimes jumped on him when no stick, stone or
other weapon was handy. But this procedure isn’t
healthy in the case of deadly varieties, such as the
black and tiger, though snake-experienced Anglo-
Indians sometimes follow it. We have, by the way,
no reptile equal in deadliness to the king-cobra, or
hamadryad, of India. This devil lurks in trees, runs
to 15ft. in length, and its venom can kill a man in
a few minutes and an elephant in about two and a

“Jack Sommers”: “Smith” (B. 20/2/’l9)
must have struck a weak kind of scarab to deliver
smokes to his mate in the clink. One cigarette is
not a full load for a beetle that can roll half a
pound of thick filth. We used to pick out the
draught beetles and send ’em half a mile with a box
of 50 cigs. lashed to their backs. A really intelli-
gent beetle would take a pound of tobacco and
papers, and roll cigarettes for Diggers with wounded
hands.
“Monyah”: I have seen it authoritatively
stated. that Ah Fat and Co. are immune from
ptomaine poisoning. On several occasions I have
seen Chinese fishermen in N.Q, prepare fish by
merely drying them in the sun without gutting or
scaling them. The fish become putrid before they
dry. and in this condition are used for flavoring
terrible stews and such-like. Quantities of the deli-
cacy are sent from the coast to inland cousins, and
require to be packed in hermetically-sealed boxes
before the railway people will allow them on the
premises.
“The Cabbage”: Was present at a bosker
scrap a day or so back. The scrappers were an
ordinary black and yellow wasp (challenger) and a
spider, about twice the size of the “yellow belly,”
dressed in a brovvn-and-black striped suit and wear-
ing extremely tight-laced corsets. There was no
preliminary sparring. The wasp hopped in and
landed a straight left right away. The striped party
fell into a clinch and hung on. Wasp didn’t like it,
ancj broke away. He returned
to the charge • three times,
only to bo cuddled by hairy-
legs. Finding he was getting
no good out of it he changed
his tactics, making a series of
quick rushes and kicking the
spider’s vest with his butt-
end. After about four help-
ings of this Hairy legs looked
sick. Then th« wasp dived at
him and hung on. In about
a minut« it was time to send
the wreaths. Yellowbelly now
proceeded to make a bee-line
for his dug-out with the corpse
in tow, but had the bad luck
to cross the trail of a smallish
ant —a black chap under
three-eighths of an inch long
with rather large purple head.
Ant, seeing the butcher's-cart
passing, dashed up and pro-
ceeded to saw off a leg. Find-
ing that the movement of the
cart interfered with the sur-
gery, Antonio rushed at the
wasp, and, fastening on to
the under side of him, did so
much damage that his nibs
was compelled tq drop the
corpse, roll over on to his back
and kick off the black devil.
The ant landed on his back
five inches away. He wasn’t
hazed much, however, as he
at once made for the corpse
and resumed the amputation
business, while at intervals of
about a minute he’d charge
the towing wasp, only to be.
kicked out of the ring again.
Luck was with him, though,
as a reinforcement of five cob-
bers arrived and at once
butted in. Two . of them
looked after the meat and the
other three attended to the
wasp. It took just one minute
and a half to convince his nibs
that the game was no good,
after which he dragged him-
self on to his flying machine,
and, after making two or
three flights of a foot or so,
rose and disappeared. Seven
anta took part in this stunt,
one chap who had been camouflaged to look
like a bucket butting in toward the finish. They
cut up the corpse and tidied the morgue in under an
hour. On being handled the ants did not bite.
“Billy T.” : I am given to understand that
the lame man’s name was not Smith. He was a
most unfortunate citizen, with a hopeless leg and
a complaint which the faculty declared would never
leave him, and after moving the many officials he
had gained an assurance that if lie attended our
court-house at 10 a.m on a given day, his case
would be attended to. His case was an appeal to
have his children taken over by the State and
boarded out to his wife at ss. per head, a custom
of the country. The man whose name was not

date specified, with three dilapidated children in
tow, all under seven, and a disordered bundle in a
section of blue blanket in his arms. He was
rebuked by authority. “This is not 10 o’clock,”
said the dour constable. “You were told to be

hut I was waitin’ for this. If we was to get five

person whose name will never be Smith opened the
blanket, and displayed a new-born child.

This is a Darnlcy Island legend :—•
„f wo ' l0 ' vs were great chums, though one of them
was lather silly. A big feast-day came, and the
whole village went into the bush to eopa-maori. At
the end of three days the people all went back to
the viHage except the two friends, who, finding rams
' el ' plentiful, decided to stay on and eat. The
uay an angry devil suddenly appeared, shouting-
-1 go } you now ’ y° u gluttons! Come here
and 111 roast you alive.” The two boys sank trem-
bling to their knees, asr the wise one, whispered,
kray, pray, pray!” They commenced praying at a
ve! y gieat rate, until the wise one, carefully opening
one eje, saw that the devil stood with both eyes
shut. The wise one again whispered to his com-
panion : Keep on praying, the longest nrayer vou
have ever prayed. Keep on stepping 'backwards,
and pray louder the further away we sten. The
devd must keep his eyes shut while we pi-ay, but
if he finds us diddling him he’ll skin us alive.” So
the two prayed louder and louder, all the time get-
tlnsr. f ," rther and furt her away. At last their
shouted prayers only just reached the devil. “Now ”
said the wise one, “run for your very skin.” They
both set off at a great rate, getting a long start on
the surprised devil. But that outraged gentleman,
after scratching gravel with his hoofs, snorted three
times, sniffed the air, and was after them like a
bad wind. By this time the silly boy was ex-
hausted, and, throwing himself into the long grass,
with hrs heels sticking out, flatly refused to go
fuither. Well, go to the devil your own way,
then, shouted his friend, who ran on. Very soon
, . v “ caught up to the sillv one, fastened his
teeth in his neck and jumped on his body with his
hoots TV lien he got tired he wound his spiked tail
around the silly one’s legs, and ran at a great rate
with him to Iveiary (home of ghosts). There he
rubbed him with a green ointment until he smelt like
the dead body of a man. The ghosts allowed him
to live, with them for a few days; then they said:
“ i his is not one of us; this is only a man. The
devil must have made a mistake again. This fel-
low’s body is all flesh.” Then the ghosts loaded him
up with cocoanuts, showed him his village, kicked
him hard and let him go.

“Mookingah”: Tell “Kidnapper” (B.
13/2/’l9) that Watty Lambert, Kangaroo King, has

bitrra (N.S.W.), in less than a month.

“Agricola”: “D.F.” (B. 13/3/T9) may
assure himself that porcupines do eat ants, though
not the kind he probably expects them to eat. For
a long time I could not obtain proof of their ant-
eating habits, and had endeavored, without success, to
coax them to consume meat-ants. But a couple of
years ago I saw one on Burnima station, near Bom-
bala (N.S.W.), devouring black ants. A big nigger
colony was located in a clear patch round the butt
of a ribbony gum. The porky rooted up the shallow
passages of the nest with his snout, and greedily
licked up the stinking colonials, prospecting round
until he had opened up the whole nest, and taking
over half an hour to finish the menu, which included
the pupae. Then I escorted him home, and all who
caught a whiff of his breath knew what he had been
eating last. I had previously been unable to account
for the rooting up of black-ants’ nests in various
places, as most creatures carefully avoid them.

starting a jibbing horse, by pouring water in its
ear (B. 2f/2/’l9), is old, cruel and (finally) in-
effective. tor the first few times it works; after
that, the beast merely twitches iiis ear. The water
in many cases gets right, into the drum of the ear,
and, besides causing agony, very frequently sends
the - jibber deaf. Best way I know is to attach a
bar so that it bumps his legs when he moves.

going up rivers, sometimes down, though all the

Wagga, N.S.W.,says that his 6-h.p. Fair-
banks-Morse “Z” Engine “fulfilled all
we said about the engine and more.”
Mr. Fergus Leonard. Combaning Siding, via
Temora, shore over 15,000 sheep with the aid
of his “Z” Engine “without the slightest
trouble” from start to finish.
Mr. F. D. McMaster, Dalkieth, Cassilis, says
that, his Type “Z” Fairbanks-Morse Engine is
“economical to run, and simplicity itself.”
There are scores of other equally valuable
opinions of the Fairbanks-Morse “Z” Engine
from farmers who have had long experience
with every class of engine, yet praise the
Fairbanks-Morse over all others.

ELLA DOYLE.
A Satchel of Books
Our Island Captures, by Angus Ilermon Worthing-
ton, deceased (the war got him in 1910), is a
business-like, well-illustrated account, written on the
spot, of an almost forgotten sea-campaign which
Australia conducted ‘on its little own with conspicu-
ous success. People have almost forgotten that the
Hun was very close to our doors when the fuss began,
and but for prompt action a shell might have
dropped on the Trades Hall just as the contents
thereof were deciding that there should be no annexa-
tion of German colonies. Therefore it is well to
read Mr. Worthington’s book. It deals with the bit
of the war which, but for our militarism and our
bloated armaments, might have furnished Sydney and
Melbourne with the surprise of their lives.- (G.
Hassell and Co.)
Dictionary for International Commercial Quota-
tions, by .lames Robertson (Oxford University Press).
This is a monument alike of ingenuity and stupen-
dous industry. Its purpose is “to provide once for
all a universal method for translating quotations in
value direct from British to foreign money, and vice
versa.” It was not enough simply to make tables
showing what an article valued at £.‘s os. 7d. British
should lie worth in Finnish marks at par. Exchange
varies from day to day; and the unique value of
these tables lies in the fact that a British merchant
can ascertain what he ought to quote in view of the
rate of exchange at 1 the moment. With exchange at
27/12 and wine to sell at 2s. 4ld. per gallon, what
must you quote per litre? Turn up page 151, and
a table there will show you what you have to multi-
ply the 28-id. by. A comptometer or other mechani-
cal appliance for the multiplication is, of course, an
advantage, for one of the factors generally runs to
six places of decimals; with this and an hour’s study
the matter of compiling a foreign price-list is simple.
In the struggle of the British manufacturer and
trader to capture and hold foreign-trade the book
must prove of very great service. The author is a
brother of George Robertson, of Angus and Robert-
son, through whom our copy comes.
The Inky Way
Two returned soldiers named Saxon have
taken over the Euroa Advertiser from its
previous owner, Theo Ford, who had run
the old show for 34 years. The Saxon
brothers, whose family has been interested
in local sawmilling for a generation, worked
for Ford since their boyhood, and joined up
from the ’Tiser office. The most engross-
ing district news ever printed by the late
owner dealt with the pursuit of the Kelly
gang, which conducted its bushranging busi-
ness in the neighborhood.
A note from George Meudell
Turned up an ancient document, dated February
11, 1879, certifying that I had a thorough know-
ledge of phonography or phonetic shorthand, and was
a qualified teacher. It was signed at Bath (Eng.) by
Izak Pitman. I wonder if there is an older prac-
titioner of Pitman’s art in Australia.

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
I sit me down to pen fine thoughts
That shall be mine alone;
A ringing line stirs in my head —■
But is it one that I have read,
Or something of my own?
Between the kisses and the wine —
Is that a steal, or is it mine?
I risk it. Promptly some ass brays:
“He’s stolen Ernest Dowson’s phrase!”
If of the curfew bell I sing.
However much I try
To sidestep imitating Gray,
It “tolls the knell of parting day” ;
And so I have to shy
Off curfews, graveyards and the like,
And try a new idea to strike;
So write of toenails. Murmurs one:
“I’ve read the same in Chesterton.”
I use a metro short and crisp.
Some fool yells “Chunder Loo!”
And then, by sweating blood, I grind
Out lengthy ten-feet lines, but find
That Swinburne’s used them, too!
Once for a book I thought a plot.
Alas! it had occurred to Scott!
The same idea upon us burst,
But Walter chanced to w'rite it first.
Even that final jape, I now
Remember, is not new;
Yet 1 feel sure I would have said
It even if I’d never read
The Critic. Not a few
Bright things of mine, I find, have been
Stolen by Byron, Wilde, Racine;
And so by critics 1 am hissed
And scoffed at as a plagiarist!

“Bad Bill” : Went for a walk from Read-
ing along the Basingstoke road and was
feeling very, very dry. Coming out of a
bit of a wood, I was just wondering if a
Digger was going to be found dead from
thirst on a country road, when I came on a
tine old pub with the appropriate name of
the Who’d Ha’ Thought It.
“0.L.”: Some contractors, in spite of high
labor costs and the price of horse-feed, still
manage to keep a bone in the cupboard.
One southern party lately put in a tender for
excavation work at a school. His price was
£7OO-odd and he got the job. The enter-
prising soul promptly sub-let the contract for
±350 and pocketed the difference without
paying a day’s wages or buying a bushel of
oats.

“Yarrum”: A big Western (N.S.W.)
squatter, who spends one of every 12 months
in Sydney, brings his tucker to town. When
he runs short, a fresh supply is forwarded,
and he foots it to the station and takes his
load by tram to the suburb where he rents
a furnished cottage. The only thing he
buys in Sydney are prawns. He wouldn’t
buy them if they could be raised on the sta-
tion. If he can get hold of some stud
prawns he may start breeding them. He
is the most practical decentraliser I know.

Recently a score or more, Chinese from
the Echuca (Vic.) district went on a visit
to their cousins at home. It’s a tomato trip.
They sent 108,673 cases to Melbourne and
the profits fitted each John up with a fat
bank-draft on London. It used to be gold
in pre-war days—lialf-sovlens for preference.

“Silex”: With the supply of imported
/terra-cotta tiles almost squelched and the
price of all terra-cottas in the neighborhood
of £2O a thousand, the Australian cement-
tile maker got his chance. There are now
dozens of different makes of machines on
the market, most of them quite simple. The
plant consists essentially of a supply of
cast-iron tile-plates, upon which the tile
is moulded, and a shaped metal “strickle”
to groove the top. Anybody having a sup-
ply of the right sort of sand can turn out
the goods cheaply, though the fact has
had no noticeable effect on the market until
lately. Before the armistice the price for
cement tiles was £lB a thousand, but they
are now selling down to £7 10s. in some
quarters; and even at this rate there is
something in the business for the one-man
manufacturer.
“Moana”: Maoriland gum country until
recently was looked upon as being dear at
£1 per acre. In the hands of experts using
scientific instruments, valuable oil, gum and
timber is being pumped, dredged and torn
out of it, the gross returns from which have
reached as much as £20,000 per acre. In
addition to this the expert leaves the land
worked to a great depth, drained and (except
perhaps for a little lime) all ready for the
surface farmer. A point worth noting is
that the gum lands were worthless while
given over to the low-wage Dago. It was
only when the high-wage specialist arrived
that they became of great value.
• # * *
Shipbuilding got a very early start; in N.
S. Wales. A return by Governor King,
dated February 28, 1804, shows that there
were then in commission, apart from Gov-
ernment craft, 22 schooners and sloops built
in the -colony, ranging up to 38 tons. Of
these 17 had been built at Sydney (including
one at “Woolamoola”), four at the llawkes-
bury and one at Richmond Hill. Bigger
than any of these was the cutter Integrity,
59 tons, launched at Sydney in January,
ISO 4. Early in 1805 Kable and Underwood
launched at Sydney a 185-ton ship, the King
George. The sloop built at Richmond Hill
was the work of Jonathan Griffiths, father
of the much more noted John Griffiths,
who built Victoria’s first vessel at Port Fairy
and turned out some fine deep-sea vessels at
Launceston, including the 400-ton full-rigged
ship Sydney Griffiths.
* * * *
“Te Whare” : Following “G.l.’s” warning
re ginseng growing (B. 13/3/T9), I have
had actual experience, and would not advise
returned soldiers or anyone else to sink
money in the culture of the plant at present.
Yet its trial as a side-line is well worth
while, and need only cost a few shillings. The
seed is trickv and slow of germination. It may
in extreme cases remain three years in the
ground inert, and then (when hope has fled)
quicken and put in an appearance as a plant.
I have raised plants of the valuable Korean
and Manchurian varieties from seed. These,
however, eventually succumbed —some to
disturbance of the roots caused by mice dig-
ging for seeds in the box containing them,
and others (when several months old) to
what is technically known as “damping off,”
caused by insufficient aeration. Both these
troubles are preventable. It is quite true
that £25 worth of North American ginseng
root might be carried about in a hand-basket
or £250 worth of the Korean article, which is
about 10 times as valuable and if of fine
quality may fetch £lO per lb. in bulk.
Botanists aver that climates having some
winter frost are best suited to ginseng.
Successful results will most likely be
obtained from acclimatised or partly-accli-
matised seed—which may necessitate the pro-
curation of green root's for planting out.
Having unsuccessfully chased the same (per
agent) in Manchuria, I am now trying
Korea.

One literary lawyer, Ronald Finlayson,
having resigned the chairmanship of Adel-
aide Repertory Theatre, it has been given to
another, Talbot Smith. This was the first
body of its kind in Australia; it was estab-
lished by pianist Bryceson Treharne, and
used to play at first in an underground room
ot the University Conservatorium. The
coming season is to start with Brighouse’s
Lancashire play, “Garside’s Career,” the
story of a young worker who had a gift for
public speaking and found it “go to his
head.
A brother of Leslie Holland, the J.C.W
comedian, has arrived to join “Lady Frayle”
on the Mclntosh circuit.
- T ,^ en ?P e . Pisott, who was appearing in
n .A°™L lately, expects to go to England

1 igott is a cousin of Hot Boucicault, which
is likely to be a help.
4-1 J-^-H-”. (London) : There is no end to
the starting of
societies for the
improvem en t of
the English drama.
The latest is a
body of enthusi-
asts brought toge-
ther by Lord
Howard de Wal-
den, one of the
wealthiest of West
End ground land-
lords and the
writer of an
opera and some
plays that did not
set the Thames
afire. This ne w
body bases its
existence on the
bold asfumption
that “the present
state of the Eng-
lish stage is de-
plorable,” and it
purposes to right
things by running
an “Art Theatre.”
The plays are to
be performed by a
co. “engaged at
yearly salaries de-
pendent on the
success of no
single production.”
A school is to ne
run in connection
with the theatre,
“Nothing hut the
Truth," at Sydney
Criterion.
Bishop Doran (Leslie
Vietor), a babe in
business matters.
and its most promising pupils are to be pro-
moted into the performing co.
Stella Power lifted a voice as round as her
own throat in Sydney Conservatorium Hall
last Tuesday, and Friday evenings. She
trilled and sparkled in her opening number,
the mad scene from Donizetti’s “Lucia de
Lammermoor,” like a bird in the heart of a
lilac-tree in Spring, for this is what the cun-
ning pinks and mauves of her dress most re-
sembled. Mr. Arlom piped his flute like a
shepherd in Arcady should; Henry Penn
drew dreams and raptures from the piano;
F. Mowat Carter’s fiddle knew much of sor-
row and gladness; and G. Vern Barnett
was a faithful accompanist.
“0.K.”: One of the Hyams sisters talks to
me casually of how they keep their drawing-
room dance-classes up to date. They are
always at the alert for instruction. A few
years ago, prior to the tango-tea madness,
there was an American carpet-dancer at the
Tivoli who insisted on his willingness to
teach the latest wriggles to anyone willing to
learn. The plump little Hyams ladies went
to the loquacious artist and took him at his
word. Soon afterwards something new and
special in leg-shaking was featured in a film-
picture. They attended nearly every screen-
ing in Melbourne, until the melodrama por-
tion bored them stiff. Then they made an
arrangement which saved them time and
boredom. The picture having done its dash,
they got the operator to give them a series
of private shows, with endless repetitions of
the dancing item only, until the object-
lesson had sunk into their souls.
“B.B.” : The other day there was a “large
and representative” charity meeting in Syd-
ney, whereat some very unpalatable evi-
dence was given. Amongst other skeletons
brought from the cupboard was one which
showed that in the slums “children’s food
is mostly bread and syrup”:
A quarter of a pound of butter is bought every
night, and from this the lunch is cut.
There is generally a scramble for the rest. Seldom
is meat bought. Usually threepennyworth of bones
are boiled for soup.
Minister for Education James exclaimed
that he would like to know how the child-
dren of these parents manage to go to pic-
ture-shows. It was explained to him that
sometimes the kids went to a picture-show
instead of Paris House by selling bottles;
“if they could thus raise half the usual
admission money they could go in at half-
time.” Of course that explanation was in-
correct. Everybody, except the Minister for
Public Instruction, knows that the children
of the land-god’s slums are “on the doors”
of all the picture-shows as the guests of
the Profiteers’ Union.
Maud Fane has gone to the U.S.A., and
Ethel Erskine comes out of the Fog to take
her place in Williamson musical comedy.
Catkin”: When the last of the Diggers
get back J.C.W. will have half an army to
draw on for dancers. Pretty well every unit
in France and Belgium has two “dances” a
week, and the whole population turns up to
the Grand Bal Australie. But, as a rule,
they won’t dance to a piano, so somebodv
brings a concertina. Still, we don’t flatter
ourselves: ma’mselle may come for the sake
of the Australians, but ma’mselle’s ma comes
for the sake of the cup of tea she gets. It
has sugar in it! Many of the old girls hadn’t
seen sugar for four years.
There are broken bows and rent scores in
Sydney amateur musical societies, which view
with something approaching dismay the pro-
gramme of the 90-odd concerts the per-
manent orchestra contemplates. Many of
these amateur orchestras see all the long
years’ endeavors go under at the first blow
from their well-equipped rival.
Bad Man ’: The Rigo operatic outfit
started business in Melbourne by advertising
its preference for Australian artists. Excel-
lent, so far; but what some of us old boys
can t understand, in the management’s pick-
ing-over of the local flock of girls, is its
unvarying partiality for the thin article.
Plenty of well-nourshed talent should surely
be available: they haven’t all run themselves
to stilts in the pursuit of fame.
“^J.M.” : ,‘Snell’s”, yarn re the lion (B.
b/o/19) opens a cage in my memory. Some
years ago I was touring the English pro-
vinces with Sardou’s “Pheadora,” and
amongst other things we carried a cage of
three lions to give realism to the hippodrome
scene. A nigger looked after the beasts. One
evening after the first act I found my
mechanist and a local man in fighting atti-
tude. I told them to get on with their work
and settle their argument after the show,
with myself as referee. When the curtain
rang down on the last act the two gladiators
appeared, and we were just arranging
preliminaries, when suddenly the biggest lion
oi the three casually strolled amongst us. In
about three seconds I found myself at the
top of a ladder in the “prompt” entrance,
and, looking down, discovered the stage
deserted, except for the lion, which had just
selected a large shin of beef from the basket
m supper meat and was calmly walking back
11 j cage ' ,-^ n hour later a policeman
called at my hotel and said he’d arrested
one of my gladiators while careering through
the streets shrieking that he was being pur-
sued by lions. There was no fight.
“U.P.”: Percy Grainger, back in miifti, is
playing at New York concerts, and is a
greater attraction even than in pre-war days,
His lady admirers, however, are concerned
about his flaxen locks. The military cut, in
their opinion, detracts from the composer’s
artistic and individual appearance.
“Willie Woodbine”: “C.G.S.” suggests
(B. 20/3/T9) that the trench songs of the
A.I.F. should be collected - and published.
But it would hardly be practicable, because
they are mostly built for “smoke-room”
consumption. In addition to those mentioned
by “C.G.S.” others worthy of note are “Oh,
Landlord, Have You Any Good WineV
Parley-vous?”—a song relating surprising
adventures; “AprSs la guerre, trSs bon,” a
parody on a pretty French song sung by
the peasants; and a lyric relating the love
MAKING THE MOST OF IT.
“I believe she talks her husband to death."
“Well, dearie, you know it’s the first time
she’s had a speaking part."
passages of a certain “Blanky Bill, the
Sailor.” The time when such songs were
heard at their best was when the troops
were on the march. Billets and rum-issue
used to draw from the troops anthems that
could be carolled 'in any church. The fav-
orites in my battalion were “Mandalay,”
“Sweet Adeline” and “A Perfect Day,” to
which last someone would almost invariably
mutter, “A perfect of a day!” And
then there was “I Wanner Go ’Ome.”
“C.G.S.” mentions “Ma’m’selle from
Armentieres.” who hadn’t been kissed for
40 years. In several estaminets in Armen-
tieres that song could be heard reeled off
bv a phonograph in all its native loveliness.
Where the records came from none could tell!
A girl has to put on her brightest even-
ing-kit now if she goes to Sydney Tivoli,
which was all re-upholstered and painted
while closed under ’flu restrictions. It’s like
a little handkerchief-sachet or a bonbon-box,
all cretonne and rose-pink silk. Whereas
the theatre which is supposed to be the
“finest in the southern hemisphere” boasts
ragged seats with stuffing coming out of the
holes, and dirt and dust everywhere.
“J.F.H.”: London theatres are having a
phenomenal boohi, and the consequence is
that old, abandoned and derelict play-
houses are being acquired by speculators for
speedy restoration. The latest is old Sad-
ler’s Wells, in North London, a ramshackle
edifice dating back to the seventeenth cen-
tury. After it had ceased to be used for
plays it degenerated into a third-rate music-
hall with a twopenny gallery. It was util-
ised for movies for a season, but latterly it
has served as a warehouse for a carrying
firm. In the ’fifties all London was attracted
to this remote and unfashionable barn by
the brilliant Shakspearean revivals of Sam-
uel Phelps and his co., which included Wil-
liam Hoskins and Rose Edouin, both well
known to Australia at a later period. It
was here that Hoskins gave a young stage-
struck wine-merchant’s clerk, the future
Henry Irving, his first lessons in the art
and business of the stage. Incidentally, in
the old days admission charges used to in-
clude refreshments, a 3s. box-ticket entitl-
ing the holder to a pint of port or punch.
Among the regular Christmas plays (other
than pantomimes) in London were “Charley’s
Aunt,” which has been staged in almost
every theatre in the Big Fog—-1G are cer-
tainties. Ada Ferrar, whom Australia knew
as the first heroine of “Sign of the Cross,”
has aged into playing the real aunt. Another
revival was, of course, “Peter Pan,” still
produced by Dion Boueicault, but with a
new hero, Faith Celli. In all the 14 pre-
vious years of “Peter” the one part held by
the same actor was the pirate Smee; being
vacant at last, it was taken up by veteran
G. W. Anson, who was popular in Australia
30 years ago. Another Christmas play—
which Australia has not seen —is “Where the
Rainbow Ends.” It was having its eighth
revival.
“Emdee”: After gauging the calibre of the
town, Dan Barry had begun to play he
soon decided whe-
th e r the drama
would be by the
it ev. Charles
Spurgeon, William
Ewart Gladstone
or Lord Randolph
Churchill. When
the play was pro-
duced it was either
some thing Dan
had vamped u p
himself or an old
friend under a new
title. “Stolen
Kisses” once be-
came “Dark Days”
in the Hugh Con-
way boom. His
great stunt was
the telegram from
the Governor. I
recollect him an-
nouncing one night
that Lord Carring-
ton was paying a
surprise visit to a
western town — in-
cognito, of course
—and would at-
tend the show
next night. The
bucolics rolled up
and Dan coolly
read a wire from
Baron Bob, regret-
ting his inability
to reach the town
—“t h e finest I
have ever played
in, the audiences
a re*. Ihe most intellectual I have met,” added
Dan—and hoping that the people would
enjoy the play by his old friend Spurgeon.
The Paris correspondent of London
Referee, though no wowser, protests against
the sort of stuff now being served up at the
theatres, allegedly to meet the demands of
English, Australian and Canadian visitors.
The popular author, Felix Gandera, ought,
it is suggested, to “buy himself a nice new
pen, or soak the old one in a strong solution
of permanganate of potash.” The Referee
insists that it is really the French public
jrhich “clamors insistently for the odor (and
customs) of the chicken-run.”
“S.T.S.”: In the book made by Louise
Jordan Miln out of the play, “Mr. Wu,”
there is much talk about Hongkong that
finds no place in the drama itself. One touch
about Australia comes in apropos of nothing,
and seems to be a personal recollection of
the author’s. At the Hongkong Club there
gathered one midnight a few members “who
had been yawning over the Richelieu of a
very scratch Australian company.” There is
not another word on the subject; but I think
I could name the leading man of that co. in
two shots.
OUT OF THE PAST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
She sat sedately at the meal,
The tall, grey matron facing me.
With every glance at her would steal
Soma vagrant, strange perplexity
About my mind. This dame, ’tis clear,
I must have known in some far sphere.
I scoffed at this as one might “Psha!”
The ghost of his great-grandmamma.
Yet certainly wo’d met before,
My young host’s mother-dear and I,
But carelessly she glanced me o’er,
Indifferently passed me by....
That night I could not sleep, and went
Down where led gladioli bent,
And there upon the tree-walled green
I chanced upon a curious scene:
A dancing figure on the lawn,
That crooned a long-remembered air,
A tall, old woman strangely drawn
From bed to frisk her members there.
She tripped and cut a pirouette
That proved she’d grace and vigor yet—•
My host’s old mother, all in white,
Cavorting in the summer night!
And as she skipped and piped the air,
Came back the grace of other nights,
Tall figures in the calcium glare,
Al] gossamer and golden tights;
And ibis-like they flock and twine,
The “Old Guard” ballet, ’B9.
’Tis she! ’Tis she! Ah, now I know—
Fifth from the right, the foremost row!
VICTORIA.
STARGAZER.
TWO VOICES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
I found them seated in a bar
Where simple actors drink,
A dusky bar where cobwebs are
And odors of a sink.
Oh, bitter were the words they used
Across their pints of beer,
And one the other gent, accused
Of vocal cords all torn and bruised,
And painful lack of “ear,”
They had more drink, the wrangle swelled,
They spoke of “notes of gold,”
And great engagements each had held.
Said I to Bung: “Behold,
Two tenors from the opera!” “Those?”
The barman shook his head.
“Oh, no, you’d hardly call them pros—•
They’re spruikers from the picture shows,
Out of a job,” he said.

This co.’s management is preparing for a
flood rather than a drought. Though present
indications are that before long the breweries
will have to meet the full weight of the no-
liquor forces, this one is apparently quite
confident that Westralia isn’t going dry. At
any rate, shareholders have, .been denied a
div. for three terms, and the co. has been
going into debt to acquire new pubs and to
add to its plant. A year ago one of Fre-
mantle’s best-situated hotels was acquired,
and during the past half another pub pro-
perty was purchased. Six months ago the
demand for bottled stuff got ahead of the
plant, and the directors decided to make
additions costing £5OOO. All this money
has been laid out in expanding, despite
the relatively poor results that have shown
up since the war. Here are some figures for
the December terms :
Profits from Sales. Rents. Expenses.
1913 .. £13,529 £B6l £8,496
1914 . . 14,240 853 8,772
1915 . . 13,013 882 9,369
1916 .. 11,682 1135 8,211
1917 . . 13,679 776 9,984
1918 .. 15,887 1151 11,863
In 1914 exes, absorbed about .58 p.c. of the
gross profits; for the past half, despite the
increase in prices, almost 70 p.c. was swal-
lowed. Heavier excise duties and taxes
have apparently run away with most of the
revenue got by lifting prices, as the pro-
portion of exes, was almost as great as it
was in the previous year.
The directors’ policy of hitting out has
had some big effects on the balance-sheet
figures. Though shareholders have not been
foor? 1 a as^e recently, the credit balance of
£287 at the bank four years ago has been
converted into a debit of £18,419, At Dec ,
1914, all liabilities amounted to £11,110; at
the last balance £32,061. Meantime more or
less liquid assets have grown from £21,285
Thus the liquid surplus of
£19,175 of four years ago has been converted
SmiT 111 excess. of liabilities amounting to
£o9J7. Deducting the depreciation reserves
there used to be £90,261 represented by
properties, plant and goodwill. (The good-
will explains the labelling of reserves as
nominal in the first table.) The book value
of these fixed assets, less depreciation, is now
£117,^61 —£27,000 more than four years ago.
"he co.’s position has thus been improved, on
paper, by about £12,700 since December, 1914
Capital is £70,000 in £1 shares fully paid.
Of this £lO,OOO was got in early in 1914, but
recent profits are not anything for share-
holders to be joyous about. Though there
was a big improvement in the last half’s re-
suits, the net profits for the year were equal
to only 10 p.c. on the capital. And until
the future of beer is definitely settled, it is
no use attempting to forecast what effect the
£27,000 recently laid out in new properties
and plant will have on profits.
*** * *
Duke Extended, Maldon (Vic.), has swal-
lowed up £34,000 of call-money besides
£55,000 of gold won, and is just* where it
started before Bryant and Dodds got on the
flute over the new lead. Wages, contrac-
tors and woodcutters have run away with
£70,000, leaving the shareholder who dashed
in when the band was playing anxiously
looking for an opening to get out with some-
thing. The past six months’ work showed
a small profit, and there is still some cash
to go on with. All pay-dirt is out of Nos.
1,2, and 4 rises, and as Nos. 5 and 6
developments have been as stonv as the
wash around them, Tom Mitchell'lias little
left to do beyond seeing if the big wash got
to the south-east will put him out of the
cement and on to better drift. If not,
there’ll be an inquest.
* * * *
Gladstone (Q-), which received a set-back
when Many Peaks closed down, can still
show some mining activity in its hinterland.
Mt. Cannindah, a game little show which
has been hoping strongly for ten years or
so, has just erected a concentrating mill
capable of handling 40 tons per eight-hour
day. Two parcels totalling 22 tons sent
to Port Kembla realised 5| tons copper
worth £548, 117 oz. silver (£24), 5 tons iron
valued at £7, and a little gold. Last year,
five parcels aggregating 162 tons were
treated by Mt. Morgan, giving 304 tons
copper and 15oz. gold. Since the” Leg.
Council turned down the Many Peaks-Can-
nindah, railway proposal last session, the
district’s hopes of cheaper transport are not
bright. Glassford Qreek hasn’t given up
the ghost either. Like Cannindah, it is
getting some machinery together. But the
flatness of the copper market has dulled
immediate prospects.
* * * *
Star Exploration, the concern launched
by Govett, Hoover and others in 1910 to
acquire tailings dumps, plant and other
a !f at . s N from th , e Hannan ’s Star Consolidated
( W.A.), weathered the war fairly well and
still manages to pay dividends. For the first
year or two work was confined to retreatment
of residues, but owing to a falling-off in
extraction the plant was shut down and
eventually dismantled. Since then the co
has been acquiring interests all over the
world, and its present holdings range from
scrip m Nigerian tin-mines and Havana
railways to shares in Australian gold shows
and in lead and ruby ventures in Burma.

London Tailoring
s : lO per cent, off all prices :
And a big stock of
Woollens to choose from.
WHAT is happening now —scarcity of supplies and high
costs —is just what we anticipated months ago, and
acted on the spot bv buying big reserve stocks of
Woollens in the earlier, lower, better markets. London Tailoring
for long past has been selling at “under ruling values,” but now
we give
The first after-war
Tailoring Reductions.
This is a campaign to get more and YOUR trade opposite G.P.O.
We are satisfied to sacrifice profits to do a larger business and
gain more customers. For we well know the old-time axiom, “once
a London customer always a London customer.” You, too, will
order eventually. Why not NOW, and save 10 per cent.?
We guarantee satisfaction
or money back.
We do this because we are not satisfied unless the customer is.
London Tailoring is made in our own workrooms by the best
skilled cutters and tailors that are to be obtained. And with
every modern facility at their disposal for high-grade work, is it
to be wondered at that London Tailoring is becoming the choice
of more and more men every day?

This opportunity cannot be
kept open indefinitely—for it
costs more to-day to buy
materials than the very advan-
tageous prices we paid. When
stocks on hand become de-
pleted the offer will be
withdrawn. Decide that with
this offer you WILL be in
time —and choose a pattern
promptly—or else send the
Coupon now and select a

saving of 10 per

well “worth

BAD Power Factor is the chief source of trouble on Alternating
Current Systems, and Lancashire Self-starting Synchronous
Motors eliminate it. Power Costs are also lowered, in some
cases showing a direct saving of from 15 to 20 per cent.
Factoiies and all industrial plants that purchase electric power can obtain lower rates
foi Synchronous Motors, those who generate their own supply can lower generating
costs considerably, because the prime users can run at full useful load and the feeders
will transmit more energy with the same drop in voltage and the same heating.

With war troubles coming to an end and
good rains, Anakie, the gem centre in
Bananaland, is looking forward to better
times. In January 6220 z. stone were
obtained worth £739. Buyers look to
America as a likely market, but the field
won’t be surprised if Fritz puts in an early
appearance.
All over the West prospectors and claim-
holders are still grumbling about the exor-
bitant prices charged for explosives, steel
and all other mining requisites. Costs have
now reached such a height that nobody on
the distant; fields can carry on except with
rich ore. The Mines Dept, has been asked
to give a helping hand by letting claim-
holders have stores at cost price, but, though
the Government professes to be anxious to
enliven the industry, i| does not seem sym-
pathetic towards the proposal.
A woman who runs a smart tearoom com-
plains of a plague which she has christened
“the eighteenpenny epicure.” Swollen re-
presentatives of the species occasionally
approach her in a confidential way and say
plaintively, “I like your fish very much ; but
why don’t you serve it with seraph sauce as
they do in New York?” “And what did you
pay for it in New York?” she asks. It then
appears that the travelled feeder (price Is.
Gd.) paid four-dollars-fifty. for liis meal and
fled from the scene holding his pockets.
“D.F.”: The notion that Australia was
divided into two islands (just the thing for
Jimmy Gardiner and the other W.A. seces-
sionists) died hard. Writing to the Secre-
tary to the Admiralty on December 31.
ISOO, to tell him about the vovage of the
Lady Nelson through Bass Straits and the
existence of a deep “bay” between Cape
Otway and Wilson’s Promontory, Governor
King said
The Lady Nelson is now fitting to prosecute her
Discovervs and to ascertain the Depth of the Bay
Lieut. Grant lOO miles across—
which favors the popular idea in this Colony that
there is a communication between the South Part of
New Holland and its Northern Extremity, terminat-
ing by the Gulph of Carpentaria, which, If so, Insu-
lates New South Wales.
The exploration of Port Phillip bv Murrav
m February, 1801, blew out this idea; and
next year Flinders knocked out a more
likely-looking candidate, Spencer Gulf.
Upwards of three-quarters of the total
Commonwealth coke production comes from
the Illawarra district (N.S.W.). At present
the industry is in a bad way owing to the
closing down of metalliferous mines and
the resultant curtailment of smelting
operations. Most of the works are on
half-time, and there are huge stacks of
coke that are only being nibbled into
by . small orders. Not long ago tne
main concern of managers was the secur-
ing of sufficient slack to meet the demand.
In some cases crushers were installed at big
expense to break up best coal for coke-mak-
ing. This increased the cost, but that didn’t
worry customers at the time. To-day it is
impossible td utilise all the small coal avail-
able (the pits are working full time), and if
trade becomes much worse it is not unlikely
that the slack made in working the seam will
have to be either thrown back into the “gob”
underground or tipped out on the mountain-
side, as in the early days.
“Y.Z.”: For some time now a hair special-
ist has been operating to his own great
advantage in one prosperous Melbourne sub-
urb. This is not at all the usual hirsute
e o- pe u t wh ° advises you there is a little bit
oft the top, and suggests energetic and con-
tinuous use of his own unrivalled Superphos
for the Hair; this is a mystic of semi-super-
natural prowess, who, if you submit a lock
of your hair, can tell you, strictly in confi-
dence, who your father was, and advise you
as to the kind of person you really are, men-
tally, morally and professionally. The wool-
gatherer has made some amazing revelations,
I am told, and is having quite a vogue,
whereby hangs my tale. The duchess in
reduced circumstances who allows a large
number of us to live with her and dine at
her groaning board had occasion to become
suspicious of one very yellow lady of doubt-
ful date, occupying a front balcony room,
.these suspicions led to the display of no
little acerbity at. meals, and in the general
sitting-room the two suggested cats on an
unfriendly tooting, always darting paws and
whipping off trifles of hide. Then came the
trying day when Madame, stung beyond
c arose at diimer > and metaphorically
fired Miss Goldie through the up-stair front
window, bag and baggage, as a person un-
suitable for a decorous home and one who
might at any moment give way to her
natural inclinations and pinch the electro-
plate or kidnap any one of the more youth-
ful and ingenuous of Madame’s male board-
ers. Miss Goldie left. Within a week Mad-
ame was going about, looking like a person
who had picked up a live black snake in
mistake for a smoked eel. We learned later,
r' 1 ,j- e , gentle drip drip of tears, that Miss
Goldie s lawyer was in communication with
Madame, and Miss Goldie, a person of in-
dubitable character and comfortable means,
wanted quite a lot of Madame’s money in
consideration of damages done to her repu-
tation by certain slanderous words and
malicious actions of the said Madame. Then
it was that the stricken landlady told us of
taking a surreptitious clipping from Miss
Goldie s coiffure, which clipping she had sub-
mitted to the necromancer above mentioned,
who, having studied the sample, dispassion-
ately. and without prejudice, had reported
that it was from the head of a person cap-
able of any iniquity, a person without moral
restraint or sense of shame, and one whom
no reputable woman should retain in her
house one moment longer than was neces-
sary for the arrangement of her rude expul-
sion. In extenuation and in self-defence
Madame put these facts before Miss Goldie’s
legal adviser. The legal gent, replied
suavely to the effect that quite pos-
sibly the diagnosis of the occult special-
ist in hair was perfectly accurate, but
if so it was no legitimate excuse for the
shameful treatment Miss Goldie had been
called upon to endure. In the circumstances,
however, he had persuaded his injured client
to take, one hundred pounds in settlement of
her claim, Madame to pay legal expenses in-
curred. Madame paid. Miss Goldie wore a
wig!

MILLINERY
A woman was at the bottom of the rumor.
She always is. Worried over the common or
garden liigh-cost-of-living and the equally-
cornmon domestic problem, Lady Davidson
playfully remarked in the family circle that
if they could not make ends meet they would
have to go. Walls have ears. And his Ex.’s
hollering for more gave color to the story.
Captain Saltmarsh resigned his job of
A.D.C. six months ago, and is sampling
bush life, llis place at Government House
has not been filled.
The Governor and family intended return-
ing to Sydney from Sutton Forest on Mon-
day. The ’flu has altered their plans ; they
have decided to remain at Hill view. There
will be no Easter entertainments at Govern-
ment House, but there will be a splash
when Jellicoe and family come in June.
Cricket is the only distraction at Hill-
view. His Ex. and lady invite the soldiers
from Exeter and The Mill Convalescent
ITomes, also some of the folk of the district,
to play or watch the matches. Over 200 were
thus entertained last week.
The town is full of wild rumors about
the “divorce” in America of the Jim-Alli-
sons. Divorce is the wrong word to use in
the circumstances. He has no domicile
there, and can’t get it, in law, even in one
of the “Divorce States,” in less than months.
A disproportionate amount of public in-
terest was taken in the match chiefly
owing to the lady’s genius for self-advertise-
ment. As a song-and-dance artist she was
well, no Dorothy Brunton. Yet she got
herself starred ; and her childish appearance
and naive confidence made her more or less
acceptable. After her marriage there was
a kind of _ Fayette Perry outbreak—on
hoardings; in full-page newspaper advts.;
m hollow, dreary picture-show intervals,
everywhere. What her tall, ultra-correct
husband thought of it all, behind his mask-
like face, was never apparent.
When the newly-wedded pair left their in-
tention was to pick up "Seppy” Allison, the
bridegroom’s only son, and take him on a
motoring trip. He arrived recently from
Germany, where he had been a prisoner
since the early days of the war, and has
been having a mild fly round preparatory
to settling down to work. He is leaving the
bruards and going into the Diplomatic Ser-
vice a profession which is so poorly paid
that only those of the highest financial
standing can enter it.
Genial Monty Somer is the most disap-
pointed man in Sydney. Secretary of the
it.A.S. for the past 13 years, he has nursed
rhe annual show along, watching it grow in
■strength, year by year. This Easter was to
see its jubilee, but the ’flu terror said it
must not be.
Three Sydney doctors fell victims to ’flu
■ast week—Bowen Thomas, of Asjhfield, a
fine athlete in his not-much-younger days;
’ r oung Noe] Franki, a son of the veteran
manager of Mort’s Dock, who. after three
years’ service at Ilandwiek Military Hospi-
al, lately set up a plate at neighboring
Coogee; and Percy Clifford, who for 10
years past had practised at Randwick.
Characteristic of good-Australian Judge
Murray, Lieut.-Gov. of New Guinea, that
when he arrived in quarantine at Albury
the other day he took in the situation at
a glance and said: “No fuss, please. I’d
be treated exactly as any other person in
'he compound.”
Johnny Sandes’ Telegraph brethren have
equipped him against the rigors of the London
climate with a silver inkstand and a walk-
ing-stick of Australian wood.
Mrs..O. C - Beale and daughters Patricia
and Hilda are sending the glad eoo-ee to
their friends—a little bit tempered in their
joyousness by the ’flu terror stalking them
to their home-land, as Sydney is the seventh
city where they have found the germ uncurl-
ing its wickedness. It made a malignant
attack on them in New York, and the family
sorrows over the loss of one of its branches.
Light months since they left London, where
their flat in Whitehall Court flung its doors
wide to the Australian soldier. At the
moment the States and Canada are the most
glowing memory, but the flame of the maple
cannot, they say, compare with Salisbury
1 lains when the hawthorn is in bloom. It
is_ there where the doctor-son has settled
with his Scotch bride. But Sydney, with
her «unny smile, her flowers and her fruits,
is without rival. Quarantine? What of it
—in a fine vessel, with Mosman Bay and
Bradley’s Head washed in sunlight to lee’
ard! Hilda of the blue eyes, by the way,
has left her best young man in England—
Colonel Buchanan is his name. He was
lately O.C. at Southall, where the Austra-
lian amputation cases are.
At the instigation of the wives of the
Medical staff of Prince Alfred Hospital,
Flora, with roses in her hands, trailed her
autumn skirts through Sydney Town Hall
last week, to swell the big institution’s
Jubilee Fund. Lady Davidson arrived to
make the speech of welcome, and J. H.
Maiden voiced the pleasure of the Horticul-
tural Society in adding the support of its
Autumn Show; then garden-lovers were
free to walk among the cactus-dahlias and
be glad. Gladness also fell to the lot of the
people in charge of the chocolate wheels and
the stalls that did a steady if not brisk trade.
Baby feet under the direction of Ethel Clif-
ford moved in a tiny-tot ballet; and little
Suzette Adams, who in frills and pantalettes
and ringlets might have stepped from “May-
time,” sold strings of balloons. In the
basement Miss Monie’s V.A.D.’s served tea
to thirsty womanhood and a wilted man or
two. May Summerbelle had our sweetest
music-makers in the vestibule, and in the
main hall bright-eyed girls swung past in
a march of the nations. On Thursday
Tivoli and J. C. Williamson artists and the
Cheero girls said their piece.
The Australian Defence Department is
hardly more unbusinesslike in it 3 methods
than the British War Office. Lieut. Hen-
derson, R.F.A., got leave to come back to
Australia some months ago to attend to his
affairs in Queensland. His ship was held
up at several ports and he soon realised that
if he returned in the stipulated time he
wouldn't be able to get to Queensland,
much less view his property there. So
he cabled urgently for a six weeks’ extension
of leave, and getting no answer he cabled
again. Subsequently he cabled some more,
and always he encountered the same stony
silence. In the end he landed at Sydnev
out of quarantine just in time to dash aboard
an American-bound steamer en route to Eng-
land and his battery.
Captain Beaufort Burdekin, R.F.A., cabled
for 10 days’ extension early in February.
Having had no reply to any of his messages
by the beginning of this month he hurriedly
left. Less punctilious officers would have
taken the leave and then explained at great,
length that there were no ships available;
that the authorities had refused to issue
passports; that, on the latter being supplied,
they turned out to be irregular ; that they had
had influenza, measles or any other trouble
that might occur to a complaisant doctor-
mend. War Offices ask for such treatment
by their lunatic goings-on.
Major "Grainger, of Sydney and the 106th
Howitzer Battery, has got a Croix de
Guerre. He is a son of Captain Grainger,
ana a brother of another captain who has
just returned after four years’ service in
the M.L. Army. The disposition of war
honors is a strange insanity. Major Grain-
ger has been in the firing-line, almost un-
interruptedly. during most of his service,
which dates from 1915. He was dangerously
wounded at Nieuport, was at Ypres at its
worst, and in all the big Somme engage-
ments. And he gets a Croix de Guerre!
Meanwhile Major Blankke, of the Nth Divi-
sional Staff (A.S.C.), gets a D. 5.0., or an
M.C., or both, for working in a comfort-
able office at a job which never brought him
within 50 miles of the danger-zone.
An even more extraordinary case is that
ot Colonel Oatley, who died from the after-
effects of gas last week. He was an original
Anzac; served with the 6th Light Horse
through the Gallipoli campaign; transferred
at his own request to the infantry, and
fought with the 56th Battalion from Bulle-
court to Villers-Bretonneux, where he was
gassed. It has been said that any man who
puts in a year in the line deserves a decora-
Because in the A.I.F. 80 per cent,
of the decorations go to the Staff, there are
not enough to go round, and men who
risk and give their lives, such’ as Colonel
Oatley, get nothing.
The Inglis-Hudsons, of Coogee, are to
have a D.S.O. in the family, Doris, of that
household. _ having promised to meet Major
E. A. Hiding in church presently.
Lieuts. Paul and Geoffrey Braddon, sons
of H.Y.. who have been on active service
nearly three years, are home-comers by the
Lancashire. The eldest son of the Com-
monwealth’s spokesman in U.S.A. will re-
turn in about six months’ time, when his
marriage with Thelma, daughter of Dr.
Fairfax Reading, will take place. This
son is a lieutenant, too.
Mrs. Alex. Hay and Miss Burdekin put
off their trip to England, as by waiting a
month it was possible for Mr. Hay to
arrange to go with them. They are taking
the children to school. Lord Chelmsford
put the boy’s name down years ago at Win-
chester —the incredibly old public school
whose motto is “Manners Makyth Manne.”
The manner of the typical Winchester boy
is magnificent; so much so that, in its
highest manifestations, it drives mere Eton-
ians half mad with annoyance.
Mrs. Sep Levy has gone to Melbourne to
her father, who is seriously ill. Meanwhile
the family is hunting for a flat. The two
boys, one of whom was in, and the other
preparing to join, the Irish Guards when
the armistice happened,' are among the fin-
ished local exponents of the Jazz. The Jazz
was brought to London ballrooms by the
Yanks, and no self-respecting young person
who goes to dances can nowadays afford to
be without it. It is a kind of three-step,
accompanied by mystic swayings that were
first demonstrated probably on the old Swan-
nee Ribber. Other expert Jazzers are Gap-
tain Jose, M.C., and his sister.
A Franco-Anglo-Australian wedding has
happened 'at Salonika: Staff-nurse Molly
Lloyd became the wife of Captain Tonois
Du Marney, of the 50tli General Hospital,
which was staffed by Aussie nurses. The
ceremony was pulled off in the church hut,
both parties to the contract! wearing uni-
form. Nurse Lloyd was trained at the
Coast Hospital, but she is English by birth,
educated in France, and lived a large share
of her life in Egypt, where father held a
military job. A sister, who was also a
nurse, is the wife of Dr. Arthur Cahill, of
Waverley.
Connie Macfarlane (and she’s well known
among patriotic collectors) has promised to
bestow her statuesque brunette beauty upon
George Downer, who just got back from the
war in time to bestow his blessing on the
Downer-Addison nuptials.
This is a Falk
photograph of J. J.
Fletcher, who has
been secretary of the
Linnaean Society
since 1885, and now
becomes its presi-
dent. The Society
has pursued its re-
searches in the ani-
mal, mineral and
vegetable worlds
since Sydney was in
its infancy. Its
founder —though he
didn’t know it —was
William Sharp Mac-
leay, whose work in
this field dates away
back to the time of
the “birthstain.” The
books and papers which he left became the
nucleus of the Society’s present magnificent
library.
The Linnseans had their first rooms in what
used to be known as the Garden Palace, the
old Exhibition building situated somewhere
between the Domain and the present Botanic
Gardens; after it was swept away by fire
the late William Mncleay cam,e to the rescue
with the William Sharp Macleay collection
and the hall in his own grounds at Elizabeth
Bay—since become the cornier of Itliaca-road
and Billyard-avenue. It was to this build-
ing in 1885 that Macleay first introduced
new-secretary Fletcher, and it is in the same
building , to-day that Mr. Fletcher continues
his researches and his work of editing the
society’s journal.
Mr. Fletcher had kindled his torch at the
fires of two great masters. In London he
had studied under Thomas Huxley and at
Cambridge under F. H. Balfour, who was
afterwards killed while on a scientific quest
in the Alps. Earlier he was trained at New-
ington and at Sydney University, where he
played the “leading female” in the first Greek
play produced in the Great Hall. Edmund
Barton played male lead. The society is in
the happy position of hai*ing great resources,
Macleay left it richly endowed, and wisely
made J. J. Fletcher executor of the trust.
His own specialty is frogs ; he can name any
species from the sound of its whistle.
When the war was not many hours old
a man named Hunt turned up to enlist and
was the fourth to do it. He was a Boer-
war veteran aged 17 at the time of
that minor campaign. He came back from
the European welter a sef-geant with a large
amount of personal damage under his khaki
and a huge collection of war souvenirs, and
regularly lifted a persuasive recruiting voice
in Martin-place. Well, he got married in
mid-March to Miss Mac Neil, daughter of an
estate-agent out Rockdale way: a nice
Bunty-pulls-tlie-strings kind of girl. The
romance began in the Randwick Hospital,
where he was a patient and she was doing
her bit. They have gone farming at \vagga,
and in spite of the high cost of footwear
The Bulletin casts one of its old shoes in
the direction of the bridal trail.
The first Carmelite Monastery in Aus-
tralia has been established at Wardell-road,
Dulwich Hill, and on Sunday the building
was blessed and the nuns canonically en-
cloistered by Archbishop Kelly. The
advance guard of the Order first reached
Sydney 22 years ago, and for a great number
of years a small community was in residence
at the Warren, which later became the head-
quarters of the Artillery trainees.
From a Brisbane look-out:—
One Warwick egg produced a Federal police-
force, but Bolshevism at Brisbane, armed and look-
ing for trouble, only induces snores from our Fed-
eral representatives.
The War Nurses’ Home is to be opened to-morrow
afternoon. Any lingering donations will still be
welcomed by the committee.
Dead from broncho-pneumonia Burchall Dinham-
Peren, 3rd Field Co. Engineers. lie was a son
of the late Edward Dinham-Peren, of Melbourne,
and was a railway-engineer and surveyor. A year
or two ago he married Madge Wooleock, elder
daughter of the well-known Brisbane barrister. lie
had served through the S. African war, and pos-
sessed a medal and five clasps as a souvenir of that
mix-up. The late Mr. Halloran, first sheriff of
Queensland, was a grandfather, and G. V. Hellicar,
late Crown-Solicitor, an uncle.
Lieut.-Colonel Toll, whose string of ribbons is so
long that it will scarcely fit across his chest, came
home this week with the men from the Ulysses.
During the S’African war he was with the Queens-
land Imperial Bushmen (“The Fighting Fifth”),
and when the great war was declared he at once
volunteered in any capacity. At Rabaul he did a
good amount of service, then returned, to Queens-
land and was given command of the 31st Bat-
talion.
Major Bean, M. 0., 3rd Battalion, was the guest
of honor at a reception in the Concordia Hall the
other night. Mrs. Mason-Beatty arranged the
affair, and leading lights of the Theosophical Soci-
ety were there to see that the Major enjoyed him-
self.
Another haven is provided for war-worn
nurses. This new refuge is at Lawson:
Mrs. Wheeler has given up her fine old
home,' Dalmeny, for two years. Situated
on the main Bathurst road, between Hazel-
brook and Lawson, Dalmeny has a beautiful
outlook, with accommodation for 12 sisters
and staff. Red Cross headquarters are in
command, assisted by the local body and
V.A.D.’s. Miss Friend is in charge.
The Bank of N, S. Wales and the Com-
mercial have each dropped £lOO into the
Hospital Friday hat, which, however, is not
to be extended publicly on April 4 as first
intended, for ’flumonic reasons.
The North Sydney War Chest and the
Graythwaite Home Committee brewed a
parting cup for Dugald Thomson on the
verandah of the R.S.Y. Club, and there’s
one of the finest views in the world to be
got from there. The Horderns and the Mil-
sons and the Randal Careys who inherit
Ivirribilli were in force, and Pastor Newby
Fraser had a word to say to the guest, who
sets out forthwith for the blue bells of
Scotland.
They hailed from Palestine. Gallipoli and
France, and they shot silkily through the
waters of the Coogee Aquarium Baths last
Wednesday when the Soldiers’ Club held
its first swimming carnival. Some had but
one arm, and some were short of a leg i but
each returned Billjim proved himself a son
of the land of surf-beaches, and true heir
to his kingdom of sunny waters. Dr. Mary _
Booth is glowing with pride over the suc-
cess of her soldier-boys, and speaks of many
more athletic contests in the offing.
The Clerical Women War-Workers should
be proud of their badge of membership, and
joint-secretaries Elsa Hale and I. Ross Hux-
ley may carry a high head over the result of
three years’ work; £1561 has been collected
and 1092 friendless men equipped. Surely
no body deserves a louder cheer from the
boys, for these girls, workers themselves,
gave w r eek-ends and spare hours to knitting
or to hammering their jiggers in the cause.
Never did they turn a deaf ear to an appeal
for socks, addressed envelopes or the pack-
ing of parcels.
George Meud 11. of Melbourne, and his
wife and her sister (Mrs. Charles Goodall)
leave by the Sonoma for God’s Own Foot-
stool on a business trip, mostly petroliferous,
so to speak. The Meudells claim they will
have _ travelled further than any Australian
married couple by- the time they get back
home. Their total exceeds 400,000 miles.
The two families of Goodalls in San Fran-
cisco are numerous and affluent. Merson
Cooper, the Melbourne sportsman, is a
cousin.
The debutantes at the Peace Ball are to

sey. _ After they have danced in the sets

The mantelpieces of society have broken
out in a perfect rash of Stanley portraits.
Ihe lady has sent signed souvenir “groups”
“enlargements” and otherwise—of herself
and the family to practically every respect-
able house in Toorak. Not to have at least
one of the social testimonials is to argue
yourself a cipher. The worthiest of all
have portraits with the names and ages
of the sitters written on the back—ra thing
that none but people whose birthdays are on
record in reference books can afford to do.
There was a brilliant audience at “Pagli-
acci’ last week; that is to say, the theatre
was full of people with money. Mr. Croker,
of the. immaculate clothes, was in a box
with his family. The Fenners and the Nor-
man Brookses were in full undress in a
lower box. A richly trimmed party from
ouf avfd Depot was in one stage box, and
Bill Falkiner had his decorative wife and
sister-in-law in another—the wife in rose-
pink and the sister in Dutch-blue and a scarf.
The Munro Ferguson chief is no craven
where the ladies are concerned. He blew in
at the tea-end of Mrs. Snelson’s Y.M.C.A.
appeal at Government House, and explained
without the batting of an eyelid that he
would have been there -earlier had he not
been busy opening a flower-show and having
a heart-to-heart talk with the dentist. Mrs.
Snelson wants the public to build “hospitality
rooms,” where young women may take their
best boys, and two-step or otherwise frivol,
instead of being forced to bill and coo in
the open. Lady Helen gave moral support
m smoke-grey draperies with a touch of
blue. Sitting on the platform, silhouetted
against the velvet curtain-folds, she looked
as picturesque as one of the vice-regal Rae-
burns.
Little King Island, in Bass Strait, does
the thing properly when it starts. Hearing
that Goy. Newdegate and a Parliamentary
party were going to pay an official visit, its
Lords and Commons met and solemnly voted
±5 for their entertainment. Even the fiver
seemed doubtful at one time, and the gag
had to be applied before it was carried.
Died at Hobart, with her 85th milestone
almost in sight, Mrs. James Keating, a
gentle and lovable soul who arrived in the
Speck, by the old ship Prontis, in 1857, hav-
ing accompanied her elder brother in search
of a home overseas for the rest of the family,
who soon foliow'ed. The pioneering colleen
married James Keating in 18G2. She had
three sons: the youngest, J.H., has been one
or the Island s Senators continuously from
the start of the Commonwealth.
The war record of the Melbourne architec-
tural firm of Blackett and Forster should be
bard to beat. Firm and staff, seven all told
enlisted to a man—or, rather, to the lady
pupil, who still nurses Billjim in Egypt. W.
A. M. Blackett (son of one of Melbourne’s
leading old-time medicoes) was lately in
Hurdcott camp, carrying a couple of pips
bravely. Partner Captain Forster, minus
his left arm, is still in France. The unit
will probably have no absentees when it next
parades for . duty at its old Collins-street

for England by the Demosthenes. Her son
Laurie is bound for Bradford and a course
of wool-classing.
The Donald Mackinnons consigned the
F et t ty younger daughter Mary to Europe
by. the Osterley. She is to spend a year at
school m Pans before she puts her hair up
and lets her skirts down. 1
. T *} e Di , ck Horsfalls have sold the old home
in Toorak to the Alec Creswicks, and have
acquired the Roystone Daveys’ picturesque
humpy on the Toorak-road. The Daveys will
shelter at that famous hash-house, the Oaks,
until they leave for Sydney. At least half
of them belong to the Harbor city—she was
a Hordern.
Jessie Masson is changing her name (pro-
fessionally— not matrimonially) to Madela
Masson. She dug up the alias at Honolulu.
They told her there that Madela was a “fire
name,” and the correct young pianist saw
the appropriateness of it in a flash.
Mrs. Norman Hodges—a Clarke of Mount
Schank—is back. She was a war-time bride
who fled to England to be near her soldier
husband. She, her sister Nesta and a mar-
vellous assortment of frocks are now in-
stalled at Wimmerleigh, Toorak.
Dr. Ramsay Smith, of the Naval Depot,
is one of the workers these days; yet, pro-
videntially, his monocle and collapsible hat
still tumble into the social picture now and
then. Thus he was at the vice-regal night
at the Princess’s, where he made a brief
though brilliant appearance in the Rupert
Atkinsons’ beflowered box during the last
act.
Harold Gaze, a Maorilander, after making
munitions, turned to a very different job. Re-
cently he has manufactured and published
six books of fairy-tales. He has written the
stories and illus-
trated them himself
with delicately-drawn
water-colors. The
Melbourne Publish-
ing Co. has produced
his “Coppertop,” the
Maoriland firm of
Whitcombe an.d
Tombs brought out
“The Mite Merry”
series last August,
and Putnams, of
New York, handled
“If I. Could Fly,” as
well as his first
book, “Omar in
Fairyland,” They
are all interesting.
Harold Gaze was
rejected here and
abroad for active service, but he set to work
m England and became an expert “turner.”
V\hen the British were getting munitions
irom America, he was sent to Brooklyn
irV, > . as an ins Peetor on the British staff.
When America entered the war, the U.S.
Government took over these works, and Gaze
came back to Australia looking for a muni-
tion job here. There was none. So he
turned a talent for drawing to good account.
Ihe young man has succeeded wonderfully
considering that his only tuition was three
months’ study under Byram Shaw, in Ken-
sington (London). Before the war, Gaze
had a yearning for the stage; he tried it,
but found he was no good as an actor. He
is writing plays instead, and now has one
hanging in the balance. He also manu-
factures poems in his spare time. This
portrait of the versatile and hard-working
young man was taken by Vandyck, Mel-
bourne.
, -D°ris Moffat (a daughter of the
chiffon shop) volunteered for the Brighton
ilu Hospital front, with the too-common
result. The plucky flapper is just about con-
valescent after a severe struggle with the
awful thing. What about a D.S.O. for such
heroines. They have taken chances as great
as most of those who have that order.
Edward Officer raised £BOO for the Red
Gross by the sale of his pictures. His wife
, was , a Fitzgerald, daughter of old
knight Tom; so, with the help of the two
big clans the Officers and the Fitzgeralds—
his shows invariably draw a gilded gather-
ing of friendly critics.
Lieut. Rex Moffat, a Brighton Anzac, has
annexed an English wife, Irene Berry. Her
father is an R.N. captain, and the pair
were married in London—or, to be explicit
in Kensington. ’
A word from Adelaide :—■
The R. S. League has made a rest-room for army
nurses at its Austral Gardens Club. Also, it has
given them full membership privileges and intimated
it 3 desire to fight their battles as if they were Bill-
jim’s own.
An Anzac Day procession and memorial service are
to occur on April 25. The guard of honor for his
Ex. will consist of a hundred fighting soldiers:
amongst them will be four V.C.’s.
Major Flood and his wife, who were on the
Matunga when the Wolf got busy and who were
later wrecked on the Danish coast in the Iyotz Mendi,
are back. They are returning, shortly, to Rabaul'
where he is to be P.M.O.
Died the other day, in a private hospital, Mrs.
H- H. McConville, better known as Mrs. E. G. Moule,
of Lakeside, Robe. Lakeside (built by her father, the
late , Mr. Danbv) was a show place in the South-
East’s palmy days, when Robe was to be the port of
the district.
Capt. W. E. B. Lowe, M.C., an old St. Peter’s
boy, reported wounded and missing in May of last
year, is now officially reported killed. He was
wounded and sent to a C.C.S., but made his way
instead to headquarters to destroy important papers
which might otherwise have fallen into enemy hands.
While doing the job he was killed. He won his M.C.
and bar with the East Lancashires.
Director of Education Maughan is still on the sick-
list, though latest bulletins report him slightly
better. He was granted three months’ sick-leave
from the end of February, with the proviso that he
should resign unless certified fit for duty at the end
of that time.
For the first time in this State’s history a nurse,
Sister M. F. Stafford, was bulled with military
honors on Friday. She enlisted for service abroad
nearly four years ago, was for some time attached to
No. 1 A.G.H. in Egypt, and from there she went to
France and England, returning to Australia about a
year ago to join the staff of No. 15 A.G.H. at
Torrens Park.
Government House will be a bachelor establishment
for the rest of his Ex.’s term of office. Miss
Macaulay, who remained here when Lady Galway and
Miss d’Erlanger left in January, departs early next
month.
Some months ago it was reported that Lieut.-Col.
Walker, who was A.D.O. here during the Bosanquet
regime (he was only an honorary captain then), had
been kiiled in action. It turns out that he was
wounded and taken prisoner by the Huns, who were
too careless or too lazy to report him.
Commander F. W. Belt, D. 5.0., is back in Aus-
tralia after a strenuous time with armored cars in
France, Belgium and Russia—especially Russia. He
went to Russia in 1915, and in May, 1916, was sent
to the Caucasus under the Grand Duke Nicholas. He
fought his way to North-West Persia, and spent the
1916-17 winter in Galatza on the Danube, fighting
Huns, Bulgars and Turks. Then Lenin and co. took
up the administrative running, and the commander
got out. Mrs. Belt, who has been nursing since the
outbreak of war, is with him.
Er. E. F. O’Sullivan, of Richmond, is off
to visit the grave of his brilliant young son,
Oapt. Bryan O’Sullivan, killed in action.
The dad was prime mover in a scheme by
which doctors in the district were freed to
go on active service while their colleagues
carried on for them.
Fritz Hart, of the Albert-street Conser-
vatorium, is all a-flutter, Frank Rigo having
decided to produce his opera, “Pierette.”
The libretto is now being translated into
Italian, the English of tenor Balboni, who
is to sing Pierrot, not being up to operatic
requirements.
E. N. Robertson is booked for the job of
assistant-secretary to the Council of Science
and Industry, with , a desk in Sydney. He
was on the Argus staff before he wore khaki,
and on his return was given charge of the
publicity work in the Repatriation Depart-
ment. • Mrs. Robertson was formerly the
wife of Frank Lincoln, the snappy actor who
was here in “The Gay Gordons” and “The
Gay Grisefte” and who fatally burst a blood
.vessel while in Melbourne.
Father Wilfrid Ryan, S.J., who has come
over from Sydney to join the staff at New-
man College, is an old Hawthorn boy, and
was welcomed by a crowd of men at the
local Catholic Club a few days ago. New-
man is already packed with residential stu-
dents, he says.
Before Melbourne
Tivoli fell into the
hands of Hugh D.
Mclntosh Fred Hall
held the best seat in
the band-pit, and con-
tributed polite piano
effects when not re-
pressing the fury of
his colleagues with
his eloquent white
hand. Eventually
he grew tired of din-
ning the music of
tame serios into the
ears of the public,
so one day he slid
from his perch and
became so lost in
composition that a
search-warrant was
necessary to find him. The change vastly
affected his musical standing and lifted him
high as an interpreter of soul. His piano
and violin compositions are rapidly becom-
ing students’ classics, and he has lately set
some of ancient Omar to music in a hand-
some volume which has run into four edi-
tions. Incidentally, the Taits are very
grateful to him for the melodies of the
“Billo” and “Billabong” items which have
been taught regularly to the public during
the run of “Jack and Jill.” The photo of
the composer comes from Ruth Hollick.
One of the Melbourne dailies is excited
over the discovery that the spouse of Italian
Prime Minister Orlando was Maggie Jones
a waitress, onCe of the Victoria Coffee
lalace, Melbourne. But why rave? A
girl_ with a name which is the Servian
equivalent of Smith married the King of that
harassed country, and his people were swine-
herds. The Robinsons have married into
all sorts of families—one of them, Anna,
married the Earl of Rosslyn, and so became
related to half the Australian peerage. As
to the Browns—well, pick up any Debrett
and see for yourself.
Zephyr Evans, daughter of Brighton soli-
citor Evans, has gone to Singapore to marry
a rubber prince named George Ord. She
and her sister Vera were the twin marma-
lade-haired child-dancers who adorned many
amateur and professional shows a few years
ago.
Winter concerts are coming along again.
Harold Elvins, who was one of Marshall
Hall’s star pupils in the harmonious days
before the late prof, tried to mix poesy with
psaltery practice, is one of the promised
recitalists for April. Elvins will specialise
in Debussy and CSsar Franck, and will
offer his interpretation of a few little things
by F —z Hart —a strictly degermanised pro-
gramme. The Uni. Conservatorium, in-
different to international disagreements and
.their effect on public feeling, is also about
to give a recital. Pianist Goll is to be the
whole show, and the entire bill-of-fare will
consist of works by the late Johann S. Bach.
P. E. Teppema, the Netherlands Vice-
Consul at Melbourne who married Carmen
Delprat, is to have a better job as Consul at
Sydney for a while. The chances are that
he will be translated to U.S.A. before long.
Vida Goldstein and Cecilia John have just
been shipped as delegates to the Women’s
Conference, Berne. The former young per-
son has travel experience in America and
England, whence she imported the rebel-
lious Adela Pankhurst. Miss John’s ability
has been evinced in many forms. She was
long contralto at Collins-street Independent
Church, whence she went to the chorus of
Musgrove’s Opera Company, and was one
of the Eight Valkyries. Then she took to
agriculture, and knows how to steer a
plough by the stars. With V. Goldstein shfe
carried on a Carrum farm, where the-
Spankhurst girl also got loamy finger-marks
on her pinny.
Turner, the old-established doorkeeper at
the d.c. of Melbourne Majesty’s, passed out
the other day. Pressmen and others who
had to visit the _ theatre regularly always
found Turner a kindly old party who never
allowed his natural courtesy to interfere
with his strict • attention to duty. He was
one of the “old reliables” in the firm’s em-
ploy, and had taken tickets for the manage-
ment for over 30 years.
From London:—•
The British Foreign Office is throwing off some
more traditions. Included in its staff at the Hotel
Majestic, Paris, are a number of “peace? girls,”
who are doing clerical work for the 700 (or three-
aboufs) delegates. They work hard from 10 a.m.
to 7 p.m. sometimes; but plenty of recreation is
provided when possible under the most careful
chaperonage. The Foreign Office made them a
dress allowance of £25, though that won’t go far
in Paris fashions at peace prices.
The Wesleyans have just put up £3OO for
their favorite bush missioner, Christopher
Mudd, a sundowning gospeller of some note.
Over 40 years ago he accompanied Edward,
Prince of Wales, through India as botanist.
There is hardly a parson more liked in the
Bush. Twenty years’ work has made him
known in every Victorian centre of popula-
tion. He glories in being the original “wire-
whiskered wowser,”
A Melbourne girl passing through N’York
writes that in “Tiger, Tiger,” Belasco’s new
success, in which Dorothy Cumming plays
second lead, the Australian girl wears an
exauisite dress of orchid satin cut very long
and flowing. Its belt is of peacock blue,
the bodice of point d’Alencon lace cut low
and square. The wrap for this frock is
fashioned of mole georgette, with alternating
layers of purple blue and rose, until the
whole effect is of sunshine through a cloud.
It’s the talk of all the women.
Recently from drowsy Shepparton came
the yarn of a war widow who, after re-
marrying, heard that No. 1, long since
reported killed, was alive and on his way
home. This apparently fired the imagina-
tion of some righteous people at Ringwood.
where the local dames delighted in repeat-
ing a similar story of an attractive war-
widoW who had recently re-married. The
Ringwood story ran that hubby No. 1 was
shortly to disembark at Port Melbourne,
where he would be met by hubby No. 2, who
would explain matters. And “What will
become of the poor che-ild V” concluded Mrs.
Grundy. That melodramatic touch was too
much, for the lady, who vents her indigna-
tion in the local paper:
. As there is a rumor—either wantoningly or
sinisterly—going round that my late husband, No.
• Qpl; V r — , who was killed in action at the
front, is alive, I beg you to please allow me
space in your valuable paper to give this a flat
denial. There is no truth whatever in it. Thank-
ing you in anticipation, Yours, etc., E. M (late
W ).
Beautiful hair is one of the features of
the almost-all-Australian chorus at the Rigo
grand opera. The heads of the chorus-
ladies shine like a sleek, well-brushed race-
horse. The principals also have lovely
locks all their own, and the same are beaute-
ously banded and coiled.
. There have been unholy rows in Red Cross
circles in the Apple Isle. It is said, indeed,
that peace-loving inhabitants of the South
Pole have sent protests against the recrim-
inatory shrieks that have been reaching their
quiet spaces of late.


UNPRECEDENTED DEMAND
For Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills.
The public may be interested in knowing
some of the particulars regarding the part
played by Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
in the present epidemic; also that over
five million pills have been sold during
the past month. They were not boomed, such as was
done by many, to use the influenza epidemic to attract
attention to their commodities, for which they were of
little use. Straight announcements were made advising
the public to keep their systems in order by taking an
occasional dose of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills together
with 10 grains of Aspirin or Quinine, but on no account to
try to doctor themselves should they show any signs of the
real Influenza, but to send for the doctor and to go to bed.
This advice has been followed to a wonderful extent. Tens of thousands
of bottles of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills have been sold since the
epidemic started. One retail company alone has passed across its counters
five thousand bottles in thirty days. Many wholesale houses have
exceeded this quantity in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. More than a
ton of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills was sold during March. There
are about two thousand two hundred pills to the pound (anyone can work
it out), which makes over five million pills sold during March in
Australia, or at the rate of about a pill for every man, woman and child on
the continent. The wonderful character of this sale is further emphasised
when it is known that no salesmen were employed whatsoever. Orders
came through the mail or over the telegraph and telephone wires, and were
in response to the genuine demands of the trade. It can therefore be seen
that DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS have played their
part, as already stated, in fighting the epidemic.
It is not claimed they are better than anything else made for similar purposes, but it is claimed that
they are far better than most, and equal to the best made in this or any other country—and why not?
The Proprietors have been making pills for nearly a century, and for twenty-five years they have been
in constant use in Australia. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are like Ford Cars. It is quantity
production that makes them possible at the price. If the formula were taken to a chemist he would
charge five shillings to make it up, and there would be no guarantee that the ingredients had not lost
their efficiency. That cannot happen in manufacturing Dr. Morses Indian Root Pills. The ingredients
are bought in large quantities and rapidly used up, and the activity of this pill is certain. They are
sold to the public at a shilling, or a little more, subject to local conditions, and in any case the public
gets good value. These are the reasons for their immense popularity, which can be summed up in the
two words, “Absolutely Dependable.”


With the influenza epidemic menacing the
public health it is necessary to keep fit and
well. A judicious use of King George IV.,
the topnotch Scotch whisky, is a wise pre-
caution. — Advt.

The Liverpool Grand National was run
hist week. Poethlyn, one of the two top-weights
(12st. 71b.), won, Bnllyboggan (the Irish crack)
2, Pollen 8. Poethlyn is the best horse across coun-
try in Britain to-day, and he has won a National
previously—the “War National.” One of the most
interesting details of this great race was not cabled
—-the name of the man who rode the winner. The
jockey who can get round the big Aintree course is
almost as rare as the horse.

It didn’t say much for the quality, of the
W.f.a. racers at the V.R.C. meeting that Eusebius
and Mistico were easily beaten by Snub, the Maori-
lander, in the' Governor’s Plate. Snub is admit-
tedly a pretty good one, but if Eusebius were up to
the standard of previous Gnineas-Derby-Leger
winners he would at least have held his own with the
visitor. As for Mistico —well, he’s getting old and
tricky, and he had apparently lost flesh since he
won the Bourke Handicap.

Both Molly’s Robe and Kennaquhair come
from mares whose inbreeding is to Kelpie, a chestnut
horse bred in England in 1855. Kelpie came to
Victoria as a four-year-old, and got amongst other
good ones Croyden (Metropolitan). Kingfisher (two
Sydney Cups), Trump Card and Circassian (Sydney
Cup). All colts; as a producer of fillies he was
then hopeless. Later he went to Gordon Brook, on
' the Clarence, and there. he began to sire such fillies
as Thyra (winner of the Glen Jnnes £1000), Maude
Atlanta and Ariadne.

The Westralian Cap and Bells, who will
be 17 in August next, won the Jumpers’ Flat a few
weeks ago at Belmont Park. He won his first race
in Victoria in 1907. Another AVestralian upon
whom Time exercises his axe in vain is Sam Law-
rence, one of the oldest cricketers playing. In the
match Australs v. Guildford recently he made 06
and took five wickets for 23 rhns. He is rising 67.
The Queensland horse West Molong won
the Kosehill Handicap on Saturday from a big field ;
and that was probably why he did win. The long-
distance cracks, amongst whom were the two or three
b.est horses in Australia, were giving the winner
stones. In a race of the sort the horse that is
lumping close on lOst. finds it hard to gather pace
after being shut in or crossed—and both Rebus and
Kennaquhair had bad luck in this respect.
S.A. Jockey Club has put Magpie and Coq
D’or at the head of the weights for both Goodwood
Handicap (6 furlongs, May 10) and Adelaide Cup
(mile and 5 furlongs, two days later). Magpie, has
10st. 51b. in the one case, and lOst. in the other
and gives the other bird 71b. and 61b. respectively
These two seem doubtful starters. After them down
to and including 9st., come Ipoh, Pistolarie, Blue
Cross, Ilaud, Lucknow, Aislabie and Nightwatch in the
short race, and in the long one New' Tipperary,
Nightwatch, Wee Gun and Defence.

Sydney touts will be on the look-out for
Shadowland when he reaches Randwick, for if James
Scobie can get him fairly fit the runner-up for last
Sydney Cup will seem very likely to improve on his
previous performance. A year ago nobody took much
stock in Rebus, who unexpectedly won the Cup, but
to-day the performance of Shadowland in running
second to the other Englishman is rated a lot higher
than it was. The tall, leggy animal had not been
trained tor a long journey, and was not expected to
heat stable-companion Lanius, but lie proved himself
an unmistakable stayer. On the other hand, there
is a strong case against Shadowland’s soundness.
Clark and Robinson thought it good enough to sell
him, and since he has been in Scobie’s stable he lias
gone wrong, more or less, on at least one occasion.

“Ajax”: Re Molly’s Robe (B. 20/3/T9).
Mr. Hillcoat was discussing the naming of the filly
with some friends. At last he said.- “I’ll have to
K°-” He had promised to meet his daughter
Molly, who -was buying a confirmation-robe. “Call
the filly Molly’s Robe,” said someone, and it was
so.
“Jack Rice”: Went’"to tbb tote to back
Palm Leaf in the Flying at Rosehill the other week,
and an R.S. in front of me pht down two Avers and
asked for a ticket on each of the 20 starters.
As we walked out he told ine it was his system—•
that he did it in every race. This is how he
would have panned out on the day : —-

£7O 10s. less 11 per cent, is £62 155., so he paid
the commission on his own investments, and lost
a. little over 80 hob. But, on the other hand,
it was a poor day for backers of outsiders.

Old-sport Isaac Joel, a member of Syd-
ney Tattersall’s since the Flood, died in St. Vin-
cent’s Hospital a week or so back.
C. J. Britton, who has died Jit Tamworth
(N.S.W.) at 66, was the owner of Parsed (winner
of the 1908 A.J.C. Derby), Karbarossa, Northos,
Fight Ever, Brentwood, Purdy, Dakai and Tiffany.
He was one of the founders of the Tamworth Jockey
Club and of the North-Western Racing Association.
For many years lie owned the Royal Standard
Brewery at Tamworth, and went in extensively for
breeding horses at his Woodhouse model farm.
Parsee was a notable winner of the A.J.C. Derby,
because he was said, like Newhaven, to have a weak
spot in his pedigree. His handsome appearance cer-
tainly suggested a bourgeois, strain, but he was the
sort of Ane, upstanding- animal that might be selected
for siring cavalry chargers, and a German Government
agent bought him.

“Camelero”: Our favorite pastime for a
while in Palestine was fishing in the Jordan. Fish
we r e plentiful and
large—bream and mul-
let. The engineers
who were bivouacked
near the river used to
discharge unexploded
Turkish shells in the
river, killing thousands
of fish, which were dis-
tributed amongst the
troops. I spent two
days in the Wady
Quelt (the brook
Cherith) and caught
scorer, of perch with
the line. This stream,
running through the
barren Judaean hills,
is the greatest place
for quail 1 have ever
seen. The birds swarm
over the rocks. Tin.
Bedouins catch them in
nets. There is a total
absence of other bird
life. One Light Horse
unit that wanted a
change of tucker con-
structed a brushwood
barrier across the
wady—after the style
of Binghi’s fish-traps
--and obliterated
“bully” from the
menu.

Two weeks a?o N. S. Langdon (Sydney
Grammar) made 100 (out of 273) against Sydney
High; last week he top-scored against St. Joseph’s
with 55. Langdon was in Grammar’s XI which
won last year’s premiership; and in 1917 he
helped combined G.P. Schools v. Sydney University.
Besides, he has done well in A.A.A. schools cham-
pionships. In 1917 he was runner-up to “Slip”
Carr in the 100yds., 220,vds. and 440yds; last year
he dead-heated with P. J. Heath in the 100yds.
(10 4-ssec.) and was second at 220yds. and 440yds.
At tennis he and Walker were only blown-out in
the semi-final of last year's Sydney Grammar cham-
pionship by Hessleim and Aitken, who afterwards
won the final.

“Q.P.”; Mention of four consecutive
batsmen being stumped (B. 27/3/’l9) reminds that
G. A. Smith (Sydney High School) stumped 10
players in two innings against Technical High
School last year. In Sydney premiership cricket
K. J. Long has the great innings’ effort of seven
stumped and one caught for Middle Harbor v. Bur-
wood in 1910. Long, who was stumping the Hun
when last heard of, played for N.S.W. in Sheffield
Shield cricket. Other efforts in Sydney cricket are
G. Harvey’s five caught and two stumped in 1905,
and R. K. Murray’s catching of six players a year
later—both being when Central Cumberland and
Petersham met.

Warren Bardsley’s 108 (out of 217) for
Glebe on a soft wicket on Saturday was one of his
best efforts. This, his fifth century this season, lifts
his aggregate to 1066, which is a record for Sydney
cricket.
* * * #
Paddington’s defeat of Glebe on Saturday
put it four points ahead for the premiership, and
only a miracle will now displace it- Paddington did
likewise in 1894-5, 1897-8 and 1900-1 (taking the
Hordern Shield outright) ; and in 1906-7 it absorbed
the Rawson Cup.

Arthur Richardson (E. Torrens) wound
up the Adelaide season with a hurricane smash of
2T6 not"out (against ~StuTE)T ierS~of- whictr-wmr-on-
t.he book at the previous week-end. It is the record
innings of' the year, though he got near it with 250
v. Adelaide earlier in the season. lie took seven
wickets for 51 v. Port Adelaide in the previous
round, and, one way and another, has a fair claim
to be the greatest all-rounder in S. Aus. cricket.
lii Brisbane Bob Barbour hit up 113 for
Colts v. Inter-Staters. For the ex-reps. Joe Thomson
knocked up 95. Among the bowlers P. Hornibrook
(Colts) took five wickets for 65 ; but it didn’t stay
the Inter-Staters, who won by 124 on the first
innings.

The noise in Victorian pennant cricket on
Saturday was made by Basil Onyons (Melbourne),
with a vigorous 113 v. Carlton. The ex-Digger’s
previous best this year was 81 v. North Melbourne.
Grirnmett (South Melb.) downed seven wickets
for 41.

“Player”: The teams met just outside
Adelaide. Either a win or a draw meant the pre-
miership for the home team. As the afternoon drew
on the intolerable possibility of a licking obtruded
itself. It was an occasion for bold and quick
action. The grass was long and dry; up it went
in flames and smoke. The fire burnt out time and
saved the situation.
“Elegy”: What about a cricket rule de-
claring a batsman out after playing his third
maiden over? It would be a blow to potterers and
average-mongers. Also it would develop good-
length bowling, encourage fast running between the
wickets and galvanise the field. “Leg” and “off
theory” would in that case have to go, and few
would miss them.

Jim Flett proved easy meat for wise old
Fred Holland at Sydney Stadium on Saturday night.
Holland, who was giving away well over a stone in
weight and 10 or 15 years in vigor, outed his adver-
sary in three rounds. Yet Flett is game and a boxer
of some class. His trouble was that his class was
not Holland’s.

It is a queer thing that, though most of
the world’s great pugs have had a strain of Irish in
them, while many have been of Irish descent on both
sides, nothing great in the boxing line lias come
from Ireland for decades. England’s best have
usually been East End Cockneys. The Scot is a poor
boxer, the Yid a good one. The three best in the
United Kingdom at the moment —Jimmy Wilde,
Basham and Driscoll—are Welsh. “Kid” Lewis, the
albino, with the bizarre mouth and teeth, who was
in Australia as a lightweight before the war, is also
Welsh, though he learnt his trade in London. He is
now a welter, and is regarded in America, where he
has been of late, as a world-beater.

Georges Carpentier has signed a £200,000
contract to fight under the management of a French
syndicate for three years. His first match will be
with Jeff Smith. Jeff is the strong and clever
Yankee boxer who, finding Les Darcy too good five
years ago, escaped from the ring on a foul. As a
fighter he is about in the Olabby class, or a point
or two below it.; and he lacks dabby’s courage.

In Soccer an alteration of the offside rule
seems certain before the next English season. When
goal-sneaking was prevented by a law that there
must be at least three opponents between a forward
and the goal he works for, it was taken as a matter
of course that they would be two full-backs, besides
the goal-keeper. It is now found that, by having
only one back, the defenders can put the most inno-
cent of ormosing forwards offside. This dodge is
being worked so often that “two opponents” is
likely to be substituted for “three.” It would
seem to be more logical just to say what is meant —
that a forward must not get “nearer to the goal than
the opposing full-back (or backs).”

Total cessation of tennis in Adelaide for
four years gave a fine uncertainty to the recent
renewal of it, a fresh generation having come on un-
announced. The result was disappointing. Great
promise was found in Rowe, the three Hones.
Roberts, Fowler (all sons of famous old players’),
Gurner and others. But Roy Taylor, the old cham-
pion, still stands alone. Ashley Campbell, the
Victorian, now living in Adelaide, had the luck not
to meet him till the final, but then had no chance
with him. Taylor and Campbell won the doubles
easily from Justin O’Dea. and Gurner; but, in the
Jnixed, Taylor and Miss LcMessurier onlv just got
home from Scott and Mrs. Rowe—the latter ladv
(whose son was a prominent player in the tourna-
ment) being dead tired after a long day of finals.
She had lost the single championship in a hard
struggle with a new player, Mrs. Hack, voungesr
member of the big family of which batsman Clem
Hill is one. Mrs. Rowe and Miss LeMessurier
(another new name) won the doubles, into the final
of which had battled Miss Parr, a popular veteran
senior by a good deal even to Mrs. Rowe. Miss
Sharp, lady champion of just before the war, was
absent, in hospital. Mills and Gunson won the
veterans event, and Rymill the boys’. No inter-
State visitors.

, Brookes is going to England to

Manly swimmer C. Crackalithorp downed
record-smashers Keith Kirkland (Spit) and
;. loss , Christie (Drummoyne) on Saturday in
y l6 JdO yards, which he covered in 61 2-ssec.
Another splash with a unique finish was the triple
dead-heat between N. and R. Longworth (both from
scratch) and H. Welland (4sec.) in Rose Bay’s 100
yards. The time was 62sec. This is the second time
the Longworths have finished level this season.
lire - Cleneig- (S.-A-.-) Sailing Club k-
arranging a race for model yachts sailed by boys.
It teaches them the art of sailing; and, further, to
have any chance in the contest the model must he,

lads will get a lot of technical knowledge generally
acquired only at sea.

“Hecagus”: For months a huge fish
haunting a deep pool near Marble Island (Northum-
berland group) set all amateur fishermen at defiance.
Party after party failed to land him. He was a
positive glutton for fishing-gear. Eventually a
special line was prepared, and he was caught—a
ponderous groper weighing 2Acwt. Besides having
seven hooks hanging about Iris bait entrance the post-
mortem revealed five more in his tucker bin, one of
which was worn to the fineness of a needle; in
addition lie carried four leads, two holt-nuts, an
inch-bolt 3in. long, and an old watch-case filled with
lead.
Sydney Automobile Club bad a petrol-con-
sumption test on Saturday that absorbed the interest
of motorists. In these tests, of course, a lot depends
on the standard. An attempt was made to get to a
scientific basis by giving the heaviest car a half-gallon
of petrol, the others, starting from that point, getting
a quantity proportioned to their weight. The result
was stated in ton-mileage: Tyler’s Buick (63.78) 1,
Boyd Edki.ns’s Vauxhall. (52.1(i) 2, 11. V. Hodgson’s
Studebaker (48.39) 3, L. W. Bye's Vauxhall (48.25)
4. The two Vauxhalls were the same h.p. (25), but
one weighed 53271 b. and the other 44591 b. The engine
pulled the heavier machine with hardly any more
consumption of petrol than a similar-powered engine
pulled the lighter one. Plainly there are other
things besides the bare ton-miles figures that are
worth considering.
* * ♦ .
Tarrant manufactured an Australian
motor-car donkeys’ years ago, and it took part in the
first Dunlop Reliability Test. It clattered from
Sydney to Melbourne, and arrived there unbeaten.
Back to Sydney, still unbeaten; then away west and
back to Sydney, and still unbeaten. But Tarrant
was not deceived. There was no money in it.
When, however, war shut off the supply of overseas
cars the 'Acme Motor Car Co. came into existence
with worlds at Sydney. It manufactured a lift!.?,
light, four-cylinder car, of which, barring the mag-
neto, all the parts were made in Australia.
The co. would have done splendidly, but lack of
material handicapped it. Previous to the outbreak
of war two men had contemplated the construction
of cars in Australia from American parts. In the
United States 90 p.c.. of the people who manu-
facture and export cars, lorries, etc., are assemblers
of parts made by other people who specialise. Even
the mighty Ford is, an assembler. The two Austra-
fralians, quite unknown to each other, went to the
United States on the same quest, returned to Sydney
about the same time, and will start producing cars
the same week. One designed his car before he left,
mapped it out on paper, part by part, and then,
having got his parts arranged for, assembled a
sample, drove it from Detroit to ’Frisco, called in
at Japan and Java on his way home, demonstrated
his car. and booked ub orders.
Even the assembling of parts is going to make a
lot of work in Australia. Radiators, mudguards,
springs, spring-hangers, Brake assemblies, tanks,
fooOpedals, running-boards, wheel-caps, spare tvre-
carriers, throttle-gears and a number of other parts
can be made cheaper in Australia than they can be
imported. Work has already started on these.
Then, of course, the bodies wiil be built here, and
in at least one case Australian-made tyres arc to
be standard equipment. And as the industry
grows more and more parts will be made on the
national premises. Both the cars mentioned are
six-cylindered.
It has come. In the U.S. they have
stavtecl shooting ducks out of aeroplanes with
machine-guns. The birds are “browned” first on the
water and again as they try to escape, and the
slaughter is said to be tremendous.
A Vie. lacrosse team is hungering to visit
Sydney next season. It is only a matter of the
N. S. Wales Assoc, getting its end of the game
fairly on its feet.
At West Maitland last week, Lone Star
jumped 7ft. 7in., which is a world’s record off the
grass. Lone Star is little more than a pony (only
14.3) and he is a five-year-old. lie is a nicely-
balanced animal, so, taking a line by Desmond, who
was at his best between 10 and 15 years of age, he
should have a long career before him. Nothing is
more questionable, though, than the value of high
jumping. It is a circus stunt, pure and simple, and
is exploited at Shows as such. No sane rider would
tackle a 7ft. fence in the field, nor yet one of 6ft.
A 4ft. 6in. post-and-rails stops all but the best.
Animals like Desmond and Lone Star are freaks, and
they do not reproduce their kind.
“Catkin”: All tlie horse-thieves of the
world seem to have come to France and Belgium, and
they provide, us with a little blessed excitement.
Within the last three nights one Australian D.A.C.
sentry fired four shots at a gang that was getting
away with some of its donks, a battery lost two gun-
horses and a battalion was cleaned light out. The
batteries, by the way, have got down to four guns
again: there are not enough men left to look after
the six. The horses are mostly paddoeked by day and
look magnificent. I wish I could ride witli one bat-
tery of all-greys through Sydney—they’re glorious.

“Barcoo”; Billy Swailes died at Charters
Towers (Q.) the other day. In the Australian Cup
of 1872 he was the pilot of Saladin, who won by a
head after running two dead-heats with the Flying
Dutchman. About those times he was principal boy
for Ettie De Mestre. Billy could neither read nor
write, but if any happening was referred to he
would remark: “Oh, yes—it was the year so-and-so
won the Cup.” lie never bad much luck financially.
AFTER THE RACE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Every one of you won the race.

Old Irish Stew, whose weird turn of pace
Secured, in itself, the pot.
The whole of the stable merits praise,
Though all hands grafted in different ways.
Every one of you won the race.
You, Percival Dry cel Is, you,
Mere child in years, with the old man's face,
Who piloted Irish Stew,
In your live-wire spurs and your green-and-chrome;
You helped to carry the bacon home.
Every one of you did his share
To lift the financial prize.
Had you, our Scientist, not been there,
Experienced, keen and wise,
Old Irish Stew would have had no hope,
Since none but you could inject his % dope.
Every one of you won the race.
You, lleddot, who trained Old Stew;
You, Books, with hides like a carapace,
Who laid him till all was blue.
But one claims (and gets) chief thanks for it—
You. Styffe, who deadened the favorite!

Gammy: Yes, yes. We saw it —this
paper is geting old and grey. Well, there are
other papers that won’t.... Eegeebee: A good yarn ;
but it was printed four years ago.... Page 1: Afraid
that much-cured animal is dead now. Try along
another line. . . .Inconnu: That animal still looks
in at the old address occasionally—last week,
for instance. .. .K.C.M.: Very poor stuff....
A.H.N.: Nothing there to make a yarn....
J.A.G.: It is certainly not poetry. Even as
verse it is poor A. 8.5.: The idea is ancient
and the handling only fair.... The Man in the
Street: It keeps too much to the beaten track....
11.C.5.: Verse not up. Ask your bookseller about
the book and tell him Whitcombe and Tombs pub-
lished it. That’s the surest way of helping an
author you admire... .Durban Girl: Verse returned
to you as requested... .R.C.: Not up... .C.8.J.:
Two held for consideration.... G.T.S.: You might do
something with it elsewhere... .H.D.: Eel yarn too
long for its interest Plodder: Sorry; but you’re
still missing the road. You want rnorey grip and
reality F.R.: No Efciane (or something): No-
blanxzgwd (or something)... .Ginger Mick: Wanted
more skill to make it seem credible... .P.T.F.:
“Gone West” rather thin C.H.S.: That irregular
tramp might possibly be used, but it. is no good for
a beginner. .. .Persian Garden: Why don’t you put
•your name on copy? The stuff is no good,
anyhow... .W.J.D.: “Armistice” fails... .C.P.H.:
Nothing there E.F.: No value in that stiff
verse... .M.D.: Verse fair in craftsmanship, but
fails in interest. .. .W.S.W.: Haven’t you got either
ink or grammar?....Oban: You’ve some distance to
go W.A.R.: Not for us.. . .F.G.S.: Doesn’t find
the range.... A.M.: The “Lady Barber” can’t get
a job here.... W.R.: No use.. ..O.B.: There’s a
heart-call in every line of it:
We are losing our old schoolmaster, Dear Old Cum ;
The children will be sorry, for the love they had
won.
To lose such a master for he always made them
welcome;
Even -the wee ones and up to the full-grown ones.
Oh ! May. these children never forget
Their dear old master for the time he spent,
For they never had any fear and may they never
regret
Their dear old schooldays of which they went.
Now as a parting wish these few lines we wrote,
For his kindlv ways, for he gave us pluck
To write these few lines and may he take note
r lhat we wish him good health and best of luck.
. ...J.H.: “Burning Off” is not good enough....
D.T.: Some distance from the target... .11.H.C.:
“Which just shows” what a hopeless sort of person
you must be... .Frank G.: Certainly. Let’s have
a look. In such a place there must be lots of little
things you know about. .. .T.G.C.: Not a glimmer
. ...M.G.N.: Verse doesn't carry it well. .. . A.R.:
Get some ink, write on one side of the paper, use a
little punctuation and collect some ideas... .C.S.G.:
Weak variation on a very old theme... . A.0.V.:
“Morning in March” says nothing new and nothing
old particularly well A. 0.: Nothing there....
T.D.: “The Prospectors” goes very heavily.... Clar-
ion: Handled better so very often. .. .J.G.: Put your
name on copy. Letters sent apart from manu-
script don’t identify the writer. .. .A.8.C.: “Plague”
won’t d0....H.F.: A bit too mysterious.. . .M.M.:
They miss, but not by much.... D^T.: “Home”
is a poor one. Two initials only are apt to be con-
fusing. ... .Bellerive: “Twenty Years Ago” does it:
We’d not the same attractions,
And life’s drama was more slow,
But more cheerful were the good old days
Of twenty . years ago ;
We paid no high rent for a crib,
In alley, street or lane,
With mouldy walls and leaky roofs
To let in the trickling rain;
We paid not fancy prices for
Our boots or for our clothes,
Our collars, shirts and underwear,
Or handkerchief for our nose,
Shylocks glory in nowadays,
Which the wise poor sorely know.

“Mario”: Frank Jardine, who died at his
seaside home at Somerset, in the Albany
pass. North Queensland, was the last of
three interesting brothers—John, Alex., and
the youngest and most adventurous, Frank,
To this family party belongs the fame of
the long overland trip from Rockhampton to
Cape York, and it is upon the side of the
long neck of Far Northern land that
Frank founded his hospitable home. Squat-
ting, pearl-shelling, exploring—all came
equally easy to this virile colonist. And
the element of romance was not lacking, for
he ultimately brought to Somerset a bride
in the person of a very beautiful Samoan
princess. It was while pearl-shelling that
Frank Jardine met and engaged as his chief
of staff Jimmie Mills, the genial Samoan
owner of Narghia Island, Torres Strait.
Jimmie was in his time a prime divef, and
could give a fathom to most when it came
to a rush for the big shell. He was the
faithful servant of a generous master, and
the association resulted in a life-long friend-
ship, and for Jimmie one of the prettiest of
the islands and a fortune.


Stop Torturing
Stopain Toothache Gtim
Instantly Ends The Ache
And Helps Save The Tooth.
Don’t put up with toothache a minute. You
don’t have to. Just put a little piece of Stopain
Toothache Gum in the cavity, or around the
tooth and all pain is gone as if by magic.
u
Let STOPAIN Stop That Boring Pain.
It fills up the cavity, excluding the air, and
stopping the mouth acids from acting on the
frantic, jumping nerve; hardens quickly, and
forms a serviceable filling that will last for a
long time—until you are ready to have a per-
manent filling put in.
Why punish yourself ? Why endure the
agony of toothache when a shilling box of
Stopain Toothache Gum will quickly restore
your peace of mind ?
Keep it on hand for emergencies.
Stopain Toothache Gum is sold by most
medicine vendors at a shilling a box, or sent
direct upon receipt of price by

At last a real ‘ does what it says ’ Corn Cure;
nothing like it or just 's good has ever been
known.
Every man or woman, who has corns, warts
or bunions ought to try Handy Corn Cure at
once and see how marvellously it works. Quit
shaving your corn with a razor. You may draw
blood and cause blood-poisoning.
Handy Corn Cure will get rid of every corn
you have got without pain or discomfort.
Handy Corn Cure is remarkable because it
never irritates or turns the true flesh sore or
raw. It can’t —it’s that antiseptic, safe and
harmless. The corn shrivels up and comes out.

Cranky disposition—yellow 100k —terrible headaches dulled brain.
All these things spell Biliousness, which is the direct result or a liver which
fails to perform its functions in a natural way.
Before you can free yourself of that bilious condition you must get your
liver in form, and nothing will accomplish this so quicklv or so thoroughly
as Chamberlain’s Tablets for the stomach and liver.
This remedy is the most valuable one obtainable for all hver and
kindred troubles, possessing properties which drive it directly to the affected
parts. Better than pills, oils, salts and nauseous purgatives which leave the
sufferer in worse condition than before.
Former affected ones, now well and strong, pay eloquent tribute to
the efficiency and power of
Jb/- the Stomach Liver.
Diarrhoea,
Diarrhoea attacks all ages, and is equally
fatal to young and old. The great danger in
this disease is due to the frequent lack of
proper treatment in the first stages. Chamber-
lain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy is a reliable
and effective medicine, and if given in time
will prevent serious results. It never fails, and
is pleasant to take. Every household should
have a bottle on hand. Get it today. Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy taken at
the first unusual looseness of the bowels will
gave suffering and anxiety—and loss of both
ime and money.
Take It With You.
The importance of having a bottle of Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy with
them is realised by experienced travellers, as
this medicine cannot be bought on the train or
steamship. Change of water and diet often
deranges the stomach and bowels and produces
diarrhoea. As Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy is the most reliable medicine
in use for these ailments, care should be taken
to have a bottle always on hand. Attacks of
bowel trouble nearly always come on suddenly
and when this remedy is at hand all danger
may be avoided.
Be Firm.
When you ask for a bottle of Chamberlain s
Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy, do not be per-
suaded to take anything else. Be firm in your
conviction that there is so good. This
medicine has been tested in the most severe
cases of cramp, colic, dysentery and diarrhoea,
and has never been known to fail. “ C an be
depended upon” is an expression always used
in connection with Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy. One bottle goes a long
way towards relieving suffering humanity. It
never fails to give immediate and permanent
relief.

“B. Longuose” : The ancient church comes
tc some queer uses. One on Church Hill,
Sydney, is now a cabinetmaker’s; and an-
other in Glenferrie (Vic.) is a bakehouse.
The steamer Devon City has just taken
from Port Adelaide a cargo of 21,000 bales
of wool. This does not come near Sydney’s
record of over 24,000 bales, but is far ahead
of any previous shipment from a South Aus.
port. At present prices the lot should be
worth well over three-quarters of a million
to Australia.
“Jaymac”: I searched recently through
various lists of useful Australian timbers,
but failed to find a mention of cypress pine.
Yet it is one of the most useful timbers in
at least three States. Being white-ant re-
sistant, it can be used in any locality for
building purposes, and, when dressed, takes
and retains a brilliant polish. Cockies have
burned thousands of acres of it.
“Arthur R.” The new motor-’buses
that roll between Melbourne and St. Kilda
are another triumph for the Australian
manufacturer. The vehicles, which are the
most comfortable yet introduced to Aus-
tralia, were built at Redferu, Sydney. The
interior, in which 25 passengers can be com-
fortably stowed, is lit by electricity, and the
seating and ventilation are pretty well per-
fect.
That rolling stone James Sadlier has
again left Adelaide for London. He was for
many ypars in the Adelaide Savings Bank ;
and he settled down to do publicity work
but literature always attracted him, and he
went to London at the beginning of the
century. The start of the war caught him
in the middle of a round-the-world trip,
in aid of conscription in his old home. Now
he goes to England again; but he proposes
to end his days in Australia.
“Canuck”: Desiring to send a jar or two
of calves’-foot jelly to a returned invalid
soldier, I discovered that every spoonful of
the delicacy that this country eats is im-
ported. In fact, it is so scarce that I
skirmished all through two suburbs before
getting a little. Don’t Victorian and
Bananaland calves wear any jelly on their
feet? I fully expect to be presently told
we are importing liver and bacon and tripe.
It seems to me we introduce everything
except a Protective tariff. ,
“Copy Boy”: Travelling to Bananaland,
Harry Manderson, formerly of Melbourne
Age, was shooed into quarantine at Wallan-
garra, with a toothbrush in one hand and a
portable typewriter in the other. The result
was Atishoo, which claimed that it was
“the most influenzal journal in Queensland.”
Within an hour of its arrival at the quaran-
tine station the first (and only) issue of 500
copies had been sold out, at 3d. a sneeze, the
proceeds being handed to the local people
who provided hot water and other camp
comforts.
“Peterkin”: London studios are still
chuckling over a story of the recent Cana-
dian Exhibition. The show was held at
the Gallery, “by kind permission of the
trustees”—who incidentally received the
trifling amount of £lOO weekly for their
kindness. One morning Sir Aston Webb,
the new President of the Royal Acad-
emy, and veteran artist Frank Dicksee
presented themselves for courtesy admis-
sion, and were treated by the tall
Canadian doorkeeper as mere members
of the paying public. “But,” protested
Webb, “we are trustees, you know!”
“Yep,” grinned the maple leaf, “and so are
most of the other buckshee-sparrers bio win’
in ’ere.”
“Henry Ilorsecollar” : Somebody who may
be wrong tells me that land at Bondi Junc-
tion (Sydney) sold 10 or 15 years ago at
£35 per foot; that it sold recently at £250
per foot; and that it may sell in 1950 at
£5OO per foot. Probably he was a blitherer
with a loose memory, but the exact figures
don’t matter. I know nothing about fig-
ures, anyhow, and may have mixed them up.
What I wish to say is that land at Bondi
Junction will sell for less in 195 Q than it
is fetching now. At present the railways,
being the only land conveyance that counts,
guide the commerce of the State into one
city and make artificial land values. Then
the roads and the tramlines direct the trade
into one part of the city and make bigger
artificial values. When the airship is going
anywhere and everywhere, irrespective of
roads, tramlines and railway-lines, I and
some friends will offer £2O per foot or less
for land at Bondi Junction, and if the offer
isn’.t satisfactory we will start the same
afternoon to create a better junction of
our own outside Eden or Jervis Bay or
Port Stephens or at Penrith or Dorrigo.
Junctions are going to be a dashed sight
humbler very soon.
“Croson”: Melbourne’s milk-distributors
are wailing piteously about the iniquities
of the milk-producer; also they are filled
with misery over the woes of the “poor con-
sumer.” A while back the authorities fixed
the price of milk at Is. lOd. per gallon to
the consumer, whereupon the organised dis-
tributor decided to pay the producer lOd.
per gal. The organised distributor wasn’t
greedy; he left only Is. for himself. The
producer thought hard, and set about organ-
ising likewise. Presently the State raised
the retail price to 25., on which Milk-oh
proposed to pay the teat-puller half the in-
crease, making his figure lid. The latter, how-
ever, being now organised, briefly remarked
that his juice would be available at Is.
3d. per gal. The distributor’s tears evoke
no sympathy. If he would, for one thing,
drop his disastrous habit of sending 10 or
12 different horses, carts, cans and boys
dow r n every metropolitan street daily in
order to serve two customers apiece, he
would save far more than the 4d. a gallon
he says he is being robbed of. And in five
or seven other ways he might save Id. or
4d. a gallon. As it is he merely threatens
to go out of the business, and it would be a
good thing if he did. The municipal coun-
cils would then be forced to take on one of
the many jobs they have so long neglected,
and the three or four councils with a Labor
majority could give themselves a chance to
do something, instead of expatiating on the
beauties of a platform that they carefully
omit to put into practice.

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
EliO’S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

Dr. Sheldon’s Digisti«Tabules
"The Real Thing for Indigestion,”
says Mr. Wallace Nelson.
I just recently returned from the Front by the Sardinia, and when I arrived
here I was certainly feeling very much out of sorts indeed. The bad *«od JJ®
trip upset not only me, but many of my pals, and we were all of us suffering
from gastric troubles and very severe indigestion, and generally ieelmg verj
run down.
Before I left Australia from
the Perth “Sunday Times,”'
two and a half years ago, I
knew Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive
Tabules as a thoroughly
sound and reliable remedy for
such ailments, and in my
worries my thoughts recurred
to them and I at once ob-
tained a tin of the Tabules
and started to use them. I
felt the benefit of them from
the first, and am pleased to
say that my digestion is now
quite normal and I think the
world of the Tabules, for
they certainly fixed me right
again, as they did some of my
pals to whom I recommended
them.
Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive
Tabules are certainly the
real thing for indigestion,
and I can honestly recom-
mend them to anyone suffer-
ing from gastric troubles or
indigestion of any nature.
Yours jfcruly,

rflHEY tramped the corridor, and turned
I To where a petulant sunbeam burned
Upon the high door of the court.
The lumpish man stepped short,
And with a huge and hateful hand
He made her stand.
He had a broad and sticky face,
The course for an incessant race
Between swift grins and sudden stares.
Her eyes were like a broken hare s,
But, oh, so indiscreetly blue,
And this shone through:
We are two sinning wells
01 waters of the seas oj song,
And love and life and laughter-bells
Ring in ns all day long.
Suddenly the swing-door creaked,
And, ashen-cheeked,
She facech the watching eyes
That quivered like black flies
Against the blur of saffron cloud
That was the faces of the crowd.
A high-backed chair bore one whose glance
Glittered with grim intolerance.
One day a week he smugly trod
To glorify a cold, far God,
And pray for keener power to find
The blemish in his fellow kind.
The rest, with prison filling pen
He scored his hate of men.
Deep in his eyes of grey
Stirred imps that seemed to say:
~We spy foulness breeding
In hearts that are bleeding,
And after
We find souls arc evil,
Worn through by the tveevil
Of laughter.
With sputtering speed his swift pen ran,
And so the hideous game began.
Upon her bright soul’s careless flames
He breathed, and they were livid shames.
In each inconsequential deed
He found a secret evil seed
That he could tell, with God-sent power,
Had fallen from the lecher-flower.
And, as he spoke, heads forward bent
Nodded an avid, pleased assent.
Such is the monstrous power of words;
They wing into our mind like birds
And roost, and let their droppings fall,
Till mottled filth bespatters all.
And there are those who walk a track
■ Narrow and straight, and all seems black
Through fear-dimmed windows of their souls
In the wide fields where laughter rolls.
These keep a ledger sin-account,
Where nought’s the only prized amount,
As though the convict, steel-barred in,
Were guiltless of the hopeless sin
He dreams of as his peering eye
Gloats on a maiden passing by.
Silence! the last dull word was sped ;
The high-backed chair, untenanted,
Stared at the paper-littered desk ;
It seemed an altar —grim, grotesque,
Built in the market-place of pain,
Where souls must buy to sell again.
The blue eyes now were dark with fear,
The lumpish man stopped near,
And with a huge and hateful hand
He made her stand.
The sunbeam that had lost his way
Saw the bowed head, and, as in play,
Seeking to crown the one he chose,
Placed on her hair a golden rose.
It burgeoned to a glory; then
Died as they closed this work of men.
No rose of gold or red or white
Can flower within the awesome night
That broods in the discreet small hell
Men call a prison cell.

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
IT had been a roasting day, the 11th of
October, 1817. Out in the west, beyond
Richmond, the sun sank through a
haze of bushfire smoke, like a great red ball
a yard in diameter. The long ridge on which
Governor Macquarie had ordained that the
town of Windsor was t<- be built was dusty
and dry in all its length from west to east.
The hot wind died . way at sunset, but the
party of officers and gentlemen who set out
from Government House at the eastern epd
found tight uniforms, high stocks, closely-
buttoned frock-coats and beaver top-hats all
too warm and oppressive, as they rode down
to the site of the new church of St. Mat-
thew, where his Excellency was to lay the
corner-stone with all the pomp and ceremony
so dear to the heart of Macquarie.
It was a gathering of most of the nobility
of the little community that dwelt in the
narrow strip of East Australia between the
only lately crossed barrier of mountains and
the Pacific. That benevolent autocrat —
but very autocratic potentate —Major-General
Lachlan Macquarie, C. 8., Captain-General
and Governor-in-Chief in and over his
Majesty’s Territory, etc., was accompanied
by some very distinguished members of the
hierarchy of New South Wales. His Honor
the Lieutenant-Governor. Lieut.-Colonel
Erskine, commanding H.M. 48th Regiment
of Foot, was there, in all his military splen-
dor. Major John Antill, Brigade-Major,
accompanied the Governor. Mr. William
Cox, Chief-Magistrate at the Hawkesbury;
Surgeon Milcham, J.P.; the Emancipist par-
son, the Rev. Henry Fulton ; Mr. David
Allan, the Commissary-General, and a host
of other inmortant, or self-important, offi-
cials attended the ceremony. As aide-de-
camp to his Excellency there w T as Ensign
Calder, of the 46th Regiment. And down
at the end of the ridge, awaiting their com-
ing on the spot where now stands the old
churchyard, was a mixed assemblage of
farmers, prisoners, ticket-of-leave men, small
boys and dogs.
Being Saturday, it was a half-holiday for
all the “Government men,” and, almost with-
out exception, they were present on the
ridge, surrounding the piles of red bricks
that were stacked about the foundation
trenches of the church which Mr. Francis
Howard Greenway, the architect of most or
Macquarie’s buildings, had traced out.
With its cavity plainly visible the sand-
stone block upon which was to be set tne
corner-stone of the temple stood ready for
the reception of the papers and coins cus-
tomarily placed below the foundations o
new churches. •
The dense and mostly ragged throng or
exiles made a curious silhouette against tne
crimson and gold of the evening sky. A
sound of low talking, laughter and argument
floated through the warm atmosphere. Theie
was a moment of diversion when two dogs
wan to fight behind a brick-pile, and the
crowd eddied about them with shouts and
betting; but the combatants were kicked
apart with scant ceremony when the caval-
cade from Government House made its
appearance, and the spectators surged back
into their places about the trenches. The
side away from the river had been kept clear
bv a few convict-constables. Their leadei
now shouted : “Hats off f’r ’s Ex’lenzy an
their honors!”
Little Jimmy Bowyer, late of Saint Mary
Axe- in the City of London —confidential
clerk, forger and “lifer” per ship Malplaquet
—removed his battered head-dress and drew
himself up to his full height of five-feet six
inches, eagerly expectant, with that love < of
pageantry which is born in the Cockn-y.
This might not be the Lord Mayors bhow,
but it was as good a substitute as ever came
the way of a Government man at tne
Hawkesbury. He whispered to his com-
panion—fat Tom Arbuckle, cook at the
Macquarie Arms, and also a prisoner of the
Crown:
“A very fine lot o’ gentlemen, Thomas.
They carry themselves well.”
«Aw —so’d you, Jimmy, liif y’ad th’ vittles
in y’r guts wot they got—cooked be a covey
like me. Turkeys, saddle o’ mutton an red-
currant jelly. Kang’roo-tail soup. 'il
ducks an’ green peas. Bes Madiery an
port vine. Ah! Stiffen em They ? ad
or ter look veil —vith me to cook for em.
Mr. Arbuckle had cooked for that famous
gourmand, Mr. Alderman Groatley, oi p •
Swithin’s-lane, until he had sold a live
turtle belonging to that gentleman—-a god-
less and unforgivable offence— and had so
received his ticket for New South Males at
the hands of the Recorder of London. He
had been an artist then, and he still re-
mained one. Not even seven years penal
servitude could take that from him.
The vice-regal party, having dismounted,
moved to the spot where the corner-stone lay
ready to be placed in position upon its foun-
dation. Mr. Cox, pleasant-voiced and
modest, spoke a few words. As senior
churchwarden he apologised for the absence
through indisposition—owing to the excessive
heat of the last few days—of Mr. Robert
Cartwright, the incumbent of the parish,
and begged that his Excellency might do
them the honor —after depositing the papers
which he had pleasure in handing him, toge-
ther with a dollar and a dump—of formally
laying the corner-stone of St. Matthew s
Church.
He handed the Governor the papers, ex-
plaining that the coins were wrapped in
them. First of all, he said, he would call
for volunteers to lift the upper stone into
position. He looked round the crowd that
stood nearest, and his eyes rested upon little
Jimmy and the cook. , ,
“Here you. Bowyer,” he cried, “and you,
Arbuckle —and a couple more of you. Bear
a hand, will you?”
Jimmy Bowyer, all eagerness to share in
the ceremony, darted forward. Torn Ar-
buckle, puffing out his red cheeks, advanced
more slowly, as befitted his bulk. Two
other men presenting themselves, the four
stood by the stone, ready to lift it when the
Chief-Magistrate should give the signal.
With great impressiveness, Macquarie
surveyed the gathering. Mr. Cox handed
him a small mason’s mallet. His Excellency
deposited the papers and their contents in
the cavity. With respectful grunts and
strenuous heaving the four men lifted the
stone into its position. And then the great
man began the sort of oration that he loved
to make. There is not room for it here.
It was nearly dark when he had finished.
“....Fellow Christians,” he concluded, “I
hereby declare this stone to be well and truly
laid. May the Sacred Building which is to
rest upon it remain ever a Temple wherein
Piety and Learning” (Macquarie spoke in
capitals on occasions such as this) “shall up-
lift the Devout and the Devoted.” He tap-
ped the stone solemnly three times with the
mallet, and, in his most impressive tone, ex-
claimed :
“God prosper St. Matthew’s Church !”
As a pre-arranged thing, each of the nota-
bilities present, in strict order of precedence,
repeated this ceremony, echoing the Gover-
nor’s pious prayer. It was quite dark as they
mounted their horses and the gathering dis-
persed.
“Jimmy,” whispered Tom Arbuckle, “’tis a
sin to waste six an’ thruppence!”
“My very sentiments, Thomas,” replied
little Jimmy, regretfully.

Ensign Patrick Calder, of the 46th, had
remained in Sydney, when his regiment was
relieved by the 48th, as aide-de-camp to his
Excellency Governor Macquarie. His friends
in the regiment had vowed that of all Mr.
Calder’s peculiar performances whilst in New
South Wales this was the most astounding.
And so, on the face of it, it was. But there
were reasons.
In the first place, his Excellency was an
old and intimate friend of Colonel Calder —
the only close relative the young officer had.
When the Colonel died, Macquarie, fearful
lest the possession of a considerable fortune—
in places where it would be easy to make use
of it as a means of going to the Devil—
should complete the ruin of his old comrade’s
heir, had resolved to keen him under his own
eye, well knowing that that young gentleman
bad a wholesome awe of himself. Macquarie’s
resolutions had a way of getting themselves
fulfilled, and, under severe and inspired pres-

sure from his C. 0., Colonel Molle, Mr. Calder
had accepted the position—with a good deal
of misgiving.
But that was not all. Mrs. Macquarie’s
niece, Miss Felicity Campbell—a charming,
beautiful and fascinating girl—had come to
Sydney to act as a companion to her aunt, and
she was the only good woman of the many
that Mr. Calder had loved in his brief but
somewhat lurid adolescent career.
Oh, but I think it would be so good for
you ! Fd like you to stay,” she had said,
smiling shyly.
So Mr. Calder had remained, and, super-
ficially, at any rate, did not discredit the
position.
Behold, then, our young and gallant
i^epd—no less devoted to the adorable
b elicity than ever —busily engaged, on the
evening of the ceremony of St. Matthew’s, in
making ardent love to pretty Dorothy Wes-
terham, eldest daughter of Mr. Daniel Wes-
terham, the Chief Constable of the Hawltes-
bury. At the other end of the town, in the
little cottage Government House, which is
now a heap of tumbling ruins, his Excel-
lency was angrily demanding where his aide
might be. But no consideration of that
could worry Mr- Calder.
“Say ye’ll come, Doll,” that useful mem-
her of the Governor’s staff was saying im-
plofingly, to the rosy-cheeked, dark-haired,
supple Miss Westerham. “I can borrow
the Major s horse, and you’ve your mare,
and well have a glorious ride along the
river—down to Sackville Reach, say? ’Twill
be splendid. We’ll come home by moonlight

Mr Calder s face lit up, too. This was
an adventure after his own heart—with
pleasing prospect of reward
e^?iu? eol ' g^ I n, W i 11 ’ Doll! ” he exclaimed
do°it e p ,ly mVe the broocb - I’ ll
The blood-red half-circle of the young
moon was dipping through the smoke haze
above the ranges when Mr. Calder ap-
proached the churchyard. Except for the
spasmodic mournful howling of a dog over
towards South Creek nothing broke the still-
ness of the windless summer night. A
Saintly-pungent smell of burning eucalyptus
scented the atmosphere, and all the long line
of the Bull Ridge, far across the river, was
IR with the incandescent glow of bush-fires.
Suddenly'he stopped, and crouched down,
lie heard voices near the foundations—
cautious,, low voices that uttered blas-
phemies in that sacred place.
“’Tis no use, ye little ’Oundsditch—l
tell ye I von’t split it. Vot’s a dollar?
Amt I givin’ ye th’ dump? That’s one
an three, blast ye to Hell! Hi’m a bigger
covey nor wot you are—so it’s right I should
ave tlr bigger coin. Ye can get a pint o’
rum wiv th’ dump. Vofc* more d’ye vant?
Greedy little warmint!”
“Well, I thought of it first, Thomas.”
whined little Jimmy Bowyer. “Very un-
fair ’ St - Why not get it changed—
one dollar’s like another?”
“Forestalled!” muttered Mr. Calder.
Oh, I don’t know, though. They’ve saved
me the trouble of moving the stone. We’ll
see, my brave boys!”
He stood up, and walked rapidly towards
the two figures. Just enough light came
from the declining moon to enable him to
make out a stout figure and a little-skinny
one. He pulled out a pistol as they became
aware of him and showed signs of bolting.
“Stand!” he commanded.
The two prisoners saw the glint of moon-
light on the barrel of the levelled pistol and
changed their minds as to the advisability
ot thght. They cringed and cowered, anil
little Jimmy whined plaintively:
“Oh, it’s a cop, Mister Soldier—don’t
shoot. We’re not going”
“Silence, you scoundrel!” hissed the out-
raged Mr. Calder. “So this is what ye’re
at, is it ? Robbing the house of God! Ye
villains! By heavens, have ye no
shame? ’Tis sacrilege, no less. Come,
you. fat one, hand me what you’re hiding
behind your back. Instantly, I say! I’d
do right to shoot ye where ye stand.”
“Oh, Gawd, sir—here it is,” muttered Tom
Arbuckle, fearfully. “F'r th’ love o’ Christ,
y r honor, don’t blow th’ gaff on us. I’ve
but a year to go for me ticket. We ain’t
meant no ’arm, sir.”
Mr. Calder took the folded papers and the
two bits, of specie—the dolla'r with the hole
m its middle and the round dump that had
come out of it.
“Now then, be off with you,” he threat-
you both ’ but I*ll consider
whether I 11 inform his Excellency or not
Hold your tongues, both of you. Say noth-
ing about it, until I make up my mind.
Now go—get out of it!”
“Gawd bless y’r honor,” (muttered fat
lorn, thickly, as they vanished into the dark-
ness.
"Well,” murmured Mr. Calder, as he
walked back towards Westerham’s—-“that
was easy! Doll shall have her brooch.
Gad ! She’s a fine wench.”
Suddenly he stopped short, and slapped his
thigh, with an oath. “Oh, dammit,” he
muttered, “I might have made them put the
stone back, though. Too heavy for me, by
myself. Oh, well!”
* * * *
But, sad to say, the pleasant little excur-
sion which Mr. Calder had planned for
Sunday afternoon to Sackville Reach never
came off, nor did Miss Westerham get her
holey-dollar brooch. Before that Sunday
was over Mr. Calder was altogether con-
vinced that the sin of sacrilege is one that
brings swift retribution.
He had gone straight from the church-
yard to the Chief Constable’s cottage, but
the house was in darkness, and he had no
notion as to which might be pretty Dolly’s
window. Without this knowledge he did
not care to chance a handful of gravel on
anj of them. Wherefore he returned to
Government House and stole silently to bed,
his ingress observed by the sentry alone.
Colonel Erskine, Major Antill and Ensign
Calder sat down to breakfast at 8 o’clock
next morning, on the verandah of Govern-
ment House.
“Look out for yourself, Calder,” Major
Antill whispered kindly, as they stood behind
their chairs, awaiting the Governor. One
glance at Macquarie’s face, as he stepped
out of his bedroom, and the frigid inclination
the head with which he acknowledged his
Good morning, sir,” assured the aide-de-
camp that he was in hot water. But it
was evidently not to be poured over him in
full volume until after the meal. The Gov-
ernor confined most of his remarks to Colonel
Erskine.

Erskine, he was saying. “Truly inspirit-

a very grave and middle-aged gentleman
stepped on to the verandah. “A chair

father of the poet Charles Harpur—was in

at once imagined that, at the least, the
Hey Mr. (Cartwright must have died in t

extent of the tragedy. He could feel a roun

reposed m his trouser-pocket. *
In a voice broken with emotion, Mr. Ha
pur, briefly and lamentingly, related th
terrible evidences of sacrilege which he ha
discovered m the churchyard early tha
morning. J
. “Horrible*! Monstrous!” exclaimed th
Governor, glowering at Mr. Calder. Ther

at his aide-de-camp.
“Mr. Calder, sir—this is your fault. Ha

ready to start at 9 o’clock, Mr. Calder. A
9 o clock sharp. Monstrous !”
.As lie crossed South Creek, at the begin
ning of his long, hot ride, Mr. Calder put his
hand m his pocket, withdrew the dollar and
the dump, and threw them idciously into the
water.
“Damn !” he spat after them.
x, If^ yoa , 100 „ k through the old Registers of
the Parish of St. Matthew’s at Windsor you
will find certain topical notes in the clerkly
handwriting of Mr. Joseph Harpur. Two of
them read as follows:—•
(he Corner Stone having been removed and the
money stolen early on the evening in which it was
deposited by the Governor, this evening about the
same time the Corner Stone was relaid by His Excel-
lenc.y and a Dollar deposited underneath it bv the
Revd Hobt. Cartwright (Monday, 13 October, 1817)
... ..His Excellency addressed the Spectators in a
very pathetic manner, passing very High and deserved
encomiums on the Resident Chaplain, returned to
compliment the Magistrates' and officers with his
presence at the Macquarie Arms Inn, where the whole
party (except Mr. Cartwright) supped together.
And
November , .1817 —The Dollar deposited under the
Corner Stone of St. Matthew’s Church by the Revd.
Mr. Cartwright was again Stolen a few nights after-
ward. This infamous species of Theft could not have
been practised only through the neglect of the Con-
tracting Builder not having prepared materials to
immediately work over the stone. It is supposed
thait the Corner Stone was thrown down each time
and the money Stolen by some of the indigent Oon-
victs employed at the Public Works in the Town of
YV i ndsor.
When he heard of this second outrage
Mr. Calder felt certain that he could lav
bis hands upon the. thieves. But he did not
trouble to do so.
