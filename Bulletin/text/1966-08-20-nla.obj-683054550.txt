COONAWARRA ESTATE
Coonawarra Estate is the original “Coonawarra”. This famous vineyard
was founded in 1890 (an illustration of the original cellars appears on
every label of genuine Coonawarra Estate wine). Years of careful culti-
vation have consistently produced vintage wines of exceptional quality.
If you prefer originals, collect and enjoy Coonawarra Estate.

Liberal " Chickens"
Sir,
Further points can be added to your
editorial (8., July 23) entitled
“Liberals Who Chicken Out.” When
the Liberal Party says that teach-ins
“are largely designed to provide
audiences for our opponents” and “that
they (teach-ins) should not be en-
couraged,” one is reminded of one of
the reasons circulated in Catholic circles
in N.S.W. against organised resistance
to Communism at the time of the Labor
Split. In highly moral tones it was said
that innocent people might be accused
of being Communists, so it was con-
sidered “not nice” to attempt to un-
cover them.
Perhaps, with time, people will un-
derstand the Liberal Party’s reasons
against participation in teach-ins and
sirpilar platforms. Surely it is obvious
that these platforms will continue to be
formed, with or without Liberal par-
ticipation. By all means, negative or
destructive tactics must not be used, but
if people see that the Right Wing resist-
ance is deserted by the Government
(particularly when TV is used), awk-
ward questions are likely to be asked as
to whether the Government is really
convinced of its Vietnam policy.
Furthermore, if resistance is mainly
initiated by the DLP or its sym-
pathisers, and it eventually becomes the
main opposition party, the Government
is going to be placed in a position of
having to justify its inactivity.
Surely Liberals are not going to turn
their backs on any TV opportunities
that may be presented? Of course, much
homework and preparation has to be
undertaken. The incident comes to
mind when people of non-Liberal per-
suasions were most impressed by a
Government minister who proved him-
self more than a match for Mr. Jim
Cairns on one of these TV confronta-
tions.
Another excuse was that the Liberal
Party did not wish to become associ-
ated with extremists of either Left or
Right. Since the Left extremists are
hardly likely to associate themselves
with Liberals, and indeed clashes with

How to avoid traffic trauma
Traffic trauma is what happens in
motorists’ heads after a lot of
bumper-to-bumpering.
When the stresses and strains of
traffic make the other motorist look
like a deadly enemy.
When the feeling of being trapped
leads to' “WATCHET YERMUG!!”
and other such exchanges of opinion
and advice.
How to avoid?
Here's a few positive suggestions:
Think, in a small corner of your
mind, about winning a lottery, and
how to spend it.
Do deep breathing exercises.
Sing the Mad Song from Lucia di
Lammermoor or something more
top-forty-ish.
Or just smile at people.
In fact, do anything except your
block.
Because people get into accidents
that way,- even get killed.
And we want you to stay alive.

them only show them up for what they
are and also bring out their policies—
which are inimical to Australia’s in-
terests this proposition is hardly
valid.
As for association with the far Right,
no doubt a certain amount of careful-
ness is called for, but surely such men
of the calibre of Knopfelmacher, Santa-
maria, Owen Harries, Fairbairn, Ray,
and others, who have carried out the
real educational work in respect to
Vietnam, cannot be accused of far
Right tendencies.
In this era of national danger, if all
reasonable means are not taken to instill
into the Australian people the will to
carry out necessary action to ensure
national survival, then Liberal
“chickens” and all Australians cannot
be certain of indefinitely enjoying the
“golden egg” of freedom.

Grose Vale (N.S.W.)
The North West Cape
Sir,
Like Mr. Parsons (8., July 30) I
have Monier shares, and therefore a
keen interest in this project.
However, there are some points which
should restrain the natural tendency to
complain of recent events.
1. Apparently Monier entered this
contract on a joint and several liability
basis. This always involves an element
of risk, and there is little point in com-
plaining, now that the risk has
materialised.
2. Little information has been offered
regarding Hardemans, who held a 75
percent share in the contract. Have they
failed? If not, what are their responsi-
bilities to Monier?
3. Nothing useful has been said about
the $4.9 million claimed by Monier
from the U.S. Navy. No doubt this is a
large and complex subject, but a break-
up of the $4.9 million into categories
would give shareholders some chance of
forming judgments. Complaints 'about
the treatment Monier have received
could then have a rational basis.
4. A circular distributed by the Aus-
tralian Shareholders’ Association states
that the shortcomings of U.S. sub-
contractors have contributed to Monier’s
difficulties.
Does the company have no redress
under the subcontract agreement in this
case?
5. The possibility of taking legal
action does not appear to have been
raised. While it is poor diplomacy to
mention such a matter during the course
of negotiations, matters now seem to
have reached a point where the case,
if it is just, should be taken further.
When the prospects of a company
are so seriously affected, it is surely
time for the Board to make the posi-
tion clear to the shareholders.
However, it is no more than fair that
shareholders should be told what risks
were taken, how the risks have turned
out, and what can be done to recover
the position. As this affects a great
many people, more information gener-
ally would be appreciated.

In THE BULLETIN, July 30, 1966,
on page 66 under the heading of “The
New Margarine-Butter War,” by Peter
Samuel, reference is made to the pro-
duction of peanuts for oil alone.

duction of peanuts in Australia to meet
domestic oil requirements, production
for oil alone under the existing scale of
tariff protection is indeed “wishful
thinking.”
Even granting a much higher level
of protection against imported peanut
oil, the high degree of interchangeability
with other edible vegetable oils which
may be produced here in large quan-
tities could still prevent large-scale pro-
duction of peanuts for oil alone.

Worst Mass Murder
Sir,
Perhaps the genocide being com-
mitted by Communist China in Tibet
deserved at least a mention in THE
BULLETIN’S editorial of August 6,
1966, concerning Indonesia, where esti-
mates of the slaughter were said to run
as high as half a million.
When invaded by the Communist
Chinese in 1959, Tibet’s population
stood at between three and seven mil-
lion (depending on what spokesman
you accept).
The International Commission of
Jurists (which as you know is a non-
political, non-ideological association of
thousands of lawyers, solicitors, barris-
ters, judges, etc., from about 100
countries) in a number of independent
and thorough investigations has found
that the Communists are systematically
wiping out the Tibetan race.
The methods of extermination re-
vealed by the Commission’s investiga-
tions include all the traditional ones of
starvation, shooting, burning, and bury-
ing alive, etc., as well as the unspec-
tacular, but nevertheless .up-to-the-
minute, one of sterilisation.
Even allowing for a figure of some
100,000 Tibetans who have or might
escape from Tibet; in the light of the
categorical and repeated statements by
the International Commission of Jurists
and other authorities that the Com-
munist Chinese are not only attempting
but succeeding in their program of
genocide; then it follows that between
three and seven million Tibetans’ have
been, are being, or will be killed by
the Communist Chinese.
While most of us seem to have
adopted an attitude of “I’m all right,
Jack,” in regard to Tibet, I think the
systematic extermination of an entire
people at least deserves a mention in
an article such as the, August 6, 1966,
editorial listing most of the other, and
possibly lesser, atrocities that have
occurred in Asia since World War 11.
Indonesia was not the only one.

Lower Yarra Crossing
Sir,
I have often been amazed at the in-
accuracy and even the casual vicious-
ness of your correspondent Batman.
He seems to subscribe to nearly every
one of the current cliches about Mel-
bourne, from the view that the under-
ground railway will do something
magical to the city to the feeling that
we need something to “distinguish” us.
However, I’ve never before caught
him out in an actual inaccuracy with
which I could tax him. Elis opinions
often seem to be founded upon erro-
neous assumptions, but rarely, it seems,
on explicitly wrong facts.
Sir, we have been talking about a
lower Yarra crossing for far more than
a mere 20 years. The earliest plan for
such a crossing of which I am aware
was a Bill submitted to the Victorian
Parliament during the iBBos, for a
double track cable tramway to Wil-
liamstown, complete with cable-tram
tunnel beneath the Yarra. Batman
should do a little research occasionally.

False Endeavour
Sir,
Irl one sense I regret having to take
sides against my old friend Norman
Lindsay, who has written the forewords
to two of my novels, but in the interests
of historical accuracy I must support
M. H. Ellis (8., July 30) in his claim
that Captain Cook’s Endeavour was not
a full-rigged ship but a barque.
In all my research I have found no
trace of the “drawing of the hulk when
it (Endeavour) was derelict” mentioned
by Mr. Lindsay, and, like Mr. Ellis, can
only conclude that she was the wrong
\Endeavour.
There was, as Mr. Ellis says, another
Endeavour in the Royal Navy when
Cook’s Endeavour, then a collier named
The Earl of Pembroke, was bought by
the Admiralty.
Mr. Ellis suggests that Mr. Lindsay
should have relied not on the hulk
drawing but on the drawing of the
Endeavour beached in the Endeavour
River (Cooktown). This drawing was
made at the time by Sydney Parkinson,
the survivor of Banks’ two artists on the
voyage, and there is another, also by
Parkinson and similarly valuable as a
guide, of the Endeavour at sea in the
Hakluyt edition of Cook’s Endeavour
voyage.
In “An Historic Retrospect on the
Occasion of the 150th Anniversary
Celebrations of the Founding of Aus-
tralia” there are two paintings of the
Endeavour, one when she was the Earl
of Pembroke, and both show her with a
fore-and-aft sail on her mizzen mast,
although, as Mr. Ellis concedes, she
had a square topsail on that mast.
I should add that after long research
I ought to know something about
the Endeavour. I have just finished a

proving the astonishing versatility of

On Price Levels
Sir,
Mr. J. F. Gordon (8., August 6)
raises a question of the utmost magni-
tude, and your own comments (July
30) about the Federal authorities’ con-
cealment and doing “their best to
silence debate” on an important issue
are relevant.
The “Spectator” (March 18) drew
attention to the “conspiracy of silence
about sterling and the exchange rate”
and quoted a reference by the financial
editor of the “Economist,” in the
“Pound Sterling,” that this question was
“deliberately distorted” and that there
was a “silent censorship on discussion
of the exchange rate.”
As an interested layman, I consider
I am entitled to ask, why is it so?, and
I am grateful to THE BULLETIN for
making it possible for the matter to be
discussed.

Intending Migrants
Sir,
Opposition by migrants to N.S. call
up seems to involve several issues, with
conscription heading the list. Public
opinion has been most sharply divided
on the method being employed ever
since it began. In practice, party poli-
tics might come into all this; in prin-
ciple the situation surely requires some-
thing better; and not the least: that it
be brought under immediate review!
Intending migrants, on the other
hand, should have the Australian Gov-
policies more precisely clari-
fied. And be asked simultaneously to
what extent they happen to be aware
of the Vietnam conflict. For hasn’t this
“Land of Milk and Honey” aspect been
pushed a bit far? Whatever it is for
us, it can’t be for strangers. Besides,
initial honesty on both sides must pre-
vent an exodus from here by people
who at best were only half in-
formed!

gestion that it will undermine our
immigration policy and deter
potential migrants or citizens. In
fact, the basic justification for the
decision is the need to defend our
immigration program.
The point is that over the past
20 years Australia has with sur-
prising ease absorbed over \\
million immigrants. Whether the
the ease of the absorption has been
due to good luck (prosperity) or
good management (intelligent
policies) is beside the point. Nor
should one underestimate the
failures in assimilation, the un-
necessary suffering of many
migrants grappling with alien ways
and languages, or the problems
still remaining. The significant fact
is that a country that had long
been socially homogeneous (the
bureaucratic phrase these days
for President de Gaulle’s abusive
term “anglo-saxon”), politically
stable and happily isolationist has
reversed its immigration policies
and recruited people from all over
Europe in a program with which
only America’s and Israel’s can
compare —and it has succeeded.
Throughout the past 20 years
there has been minimum conflict
between natives and migrants.
But now, for the first time, a
situation is emerging that could
provoke hostility to migrants of a
kind that could upset the whole
program the war in Vietnam.
As thousands of Australian fami-
lies become involved in this war,
nothing could be more calculated
to foment anti-migrant bitterness
than the knowledge that while a
son or brother is risking being shot
up in the defence of Australia’s
freedom, a migrant youth down
the street has no responsibility in
the matter at all. Worse, such
hostility would make no fine
distinction between naturalised
migrants who accept their respon-
sibilities and the others; all
migrants and their children would
be resented equally. This danger
had to be avoided at all costs.
A relevant factor is that almost
all migrant spokesmen in Aus-
tralia recognise this point and sup-
port the Government’s decision
(some even maintaining that any
other decision would be unjust
discrimination against migrants
who claim the right of national
service). Those European critics
who complain that only the United
States and Australia in the whole
of the Western world make aliens
liable for national service ignore
the simple fact that only Aus-
tralia and the United States in the
whole Western world are countries
of mass migration.
America’s experience is also
relevant on the question of future
migrants. America has long re-
quired migrants to register for the
draft without reducing the attrac-
tion of the country, and one can
be confident the same will happen
here, especially since in Australia
a migrant must be 21 and resident
for two years before being liable
for National Service conditions
far more flexible than the corres-
ponding one in America. But this
is a secondary consideration; the
main point is that any other policy
would have a far worse effect on
migration.

Djakarta’s New Confrontation
From DENNIS BLOOD WORTH in Singapore
CONFRONTATION has ended, peace has been restored, and with it Indonesia
has won back the chance to subvert and destroy Malaysia quietly from within
which President Sukarno threw away when he resorted to arms three years
ago. The agreement signed in Djakarta last Thursday ostensibly provides for an end
to hostilities and the “immediate” establishment of diplomatic relations between
Malaysia and Indonesia.
It does so on the understanding that
General elections will be held early
next year to allow the peoples of the
Malaysian North Borneo States of Sara-
wak and Sabah to decide for or
against membership of the young Com-
monwealth Federation.
But President Sukarno has already
thrown a bombshell amid the general
jubilation by suddenly announcing that
Indonesian diplomatic recognition of
Malaysia will only take place after the
elections in North Borneo. This reve-
lation is obviously designed to cause
the Malaysian Government the maxi-
mum discomfort, since it discloses that
Kuala Lumpur has made a major con-
cession to Djakarta which the Malay-
sians themselves evidently expected
both sides to keep quiet about they
have been most evasive on the subject.
The tranquility of Malaysia will still
depend very much on the sincerity of
the new anti-Communist leaders in
Djakarta who have partly eclipsed their
ambitious Left wing President, it
seems.
Sukarno’s malevolence towards
Malaya is far older than even the first
proposal to expand it into Malaysia.
He has always been obsessed by the
fragility of his- sprawling empire of
three thousand islands, by the need to
tighten the belt and put the struggle
for the sovereignty, unity, and “national
identity” of 105 million Indonesians
before fat pay envelopes and full rice
bowls. Neighboring Malaya, the envy
of Indonesians impoverished by his
policies, represented both a danger and
everything he detested. It was protec-
ted by British bases and it welcomed
foreign investment. It was a somewhat
conservative federation of Sultanates,
and its very existence therefore en-
couraged rebels in Indonesia’s outer is-
lands who resented the Bung’s central-
ised government in Djakarta and Java-
nese hegemony over all others. It gave
the lie to his nationalistic pretensions
by putting prosperity first. And it was
an embarrassingly solid success.
Sukarno’s reactions to plans for
weaving the British territories in North
Borneo which shared a 970-mile
frontier with Indonesia into a wider
Malaysian federation governed from
Kuala Lumpur were predictable.
The quarrel was seemingly patched
up by the Manila Accord oQune, 1963,
which stipulated that Indonesia and
the Philippines would “welcome”
Malaysia provided that the consent of
the inhabitants of the Borneo territories
was ascertained by the United Nations.
However, the London Agreement for-
mally providing for the inauguration
of the Federation was signed in July,
well before a somewhat perfunctory
UN survey of public opinion in Sara-
wak and Sabah was undertaken at the
end of August.
And on 16th September Malaysia
came into being without further ado.
Claiming he had been cheated, an in-
furiated Sukarno then launched con-
frontation in earnest. In the three
years that followed Djakarta trained,
armed, and despatched on raiding mis-
sions into the matted, mountainous
jungles of North Borneo, not only ter-
rorists of the Sarawak Clendestine Com-
munist Organisation (CCO) and
“volunteers,” but highly trained Indo-
nesian Regular Army units, operating
in guerilla war parties sometimes more
than 60 strong.
By 1965 Djakarta had about 30,000
men on the Borneo border and substan-
tial formations not only in North
Sumatra, just across the Straits of Mal-
acca from Malaya, but also in the Rhio
Archipelago which is plainly visible
from Singapore. While saboteurs ex-
ploded bombs and plastic charges in
Singapore itself, the Indonesians began
in the second half of 1964 to throw sea-
borne forces and paratroopers against
the South Malayan mainland itself in
groups up to 150 strong. These had
orders to start an insurrection among
local inhabitants who, according to
lamentably poor Indonesian intelligence,
were ripe for revolution.
JN Indonesia the “Crush Malaysia”
campaign was maintained at a shrill
pitch, and 21 million “volunteers” were
recruited for training. The Indonesian
Communist Party (PKI) led the pack
with two objects in view: to “smash
imperialism” in the area, and to create
a war-scare so that they might persuade
Sukarno to arm millions of peasants
and workers, in theory for the defence
of the republic but in fact for a Com-
munist coup (Sukarno did not give his
consent, however).
At the height of confrontation the
British C-in-C disposed about 45,000
British, Australian, and New Zea-
land ground troops in the area, and the
director of operations in Borneo com-
manded nine British and Gurkha bat-
talions in the jungle in addition to three
Malaysian battalions. Nearly 80 war-
ships, including two carriers, patrolled
Malaysian waters and intercepted raid-
ers, and the air strength was raised to
about 300 planes and helicopters. The
naval screen caught more than half of
all Indonesian parties despatched by
sea, and the rest were usually wiped out
within a few days of landing in Malaya.
Meanwhile in Borneo a system of
jungle border forts and active patrol-
ling, with helicopters moving the men in
and out of position like hands hover-
ing over a giant chessboard, was de-
veloped to an astonishing degree of effi-
ciency and successfully broke up every
major attempt at infiltration.
Some 10,000 British troops, as well
as Australians and New Zealanders, will
now be pulled out of Borneo as Malay-
sians replace them, and the bulk will
probably have left by Christmas. There-
after Mr. Healey’s count-down will
enter the second phase, and the num-
ber of British battalions in Malaysia
and Singapore may be reduced to about
seven in all.
But is it really all over? It is already
obvious that the question of self-deter-
mination in Sarawak and Sabah still
sticks in the gullet of agreement like a
fishbone, particularly as the Chief Mini-
sters of both those States have firmly
declared that they are against holding
elections on the Malaysia issue in the
near future, and Malaysia herself can-
not be entirely confident of the results.
r J , HERE may, therefore, be further pre-
texts for pro-Sukarnoists to revive
confrontation. Since the signing of the
Bangkok Pact, armed and uniformed
terrorists have twice infiltrated Sarawak
from their Indonesian bases and clashed
with Anglo-Malaysian security forces,
and even if Regular Army units are
restrained in future, wouldbe Indo-
nesian troublemakers still dispose of the
Sarawak CCO and other “volunteers.”
However, in the long term, a far
greater worry for Tunku Abdul Rah-
man, the Malaysian Premier, must be
the threat of subversion if diplomatic
relations are resumed. Before Malaysia
was formed Indonesian “diplomats” in
Malaya and Singapore were busy
suborning and recruiting Malays, many
of whom are of Indonesian origin or
look up to Indonesia as the centre of
their racial culture and it is clear that
the Indonesians have not lost their eye
for empire.
Although Singapore officials tactfully
deny it, private sources have disclosed
that the recent Indonesian economic
mission to this island spent much of its
time contacting and sounding out the
Malay minority on their feelings about
Djakarta and about their own Govern-
ment. “Physical” confrontation is over.
Now the real struggle to preserve
Malaysia can begin.


Alien Sons
FOR the Government it had been a
“matter of philosophical prin-
ciple.” That was how the Minister
for Labor and National Service, M. L.
Bury, explained the decision to make
aliens living in Australia liable for
national service call-up.
There was certainly a matter of prin-
ciple involved. But beyond that the
Government must have been politically
aware of the potentially dangerous fund
of resentment building up against the
inequalities of a scheme which made a
minority of newcomers into a privileged
class in the community.
Mr. Bury did not spell it out. But the
implications of what he did say were
clear enough. “The legislation is geared
to those who plan to stay here per-
manently. They should share the obli-
gations as well as the benefits of the
country.”
Talking in his Sydney office last week
after the legislation had been front-page
news in every Australian newspaper (for
once probably a reasonable guide to
the public interest in the news) Mr.
Bury emphasised that the call-up of
aliens would help greatly in their
absorption. Otherwise, there was a
danger that migrants would be regarded
as a separate group. “Some parents
would say ! My son Joe has to do it.
Why not Sopholos down the street.’ ”
Although the Government had investi-
gated possible reactions from migrant
groups in Australia to the decision, Mr.
Bury said it would have had to make
the decision irrespective of the attitudes.
The Department of Immigration had
sounded out opinion as had Mr. Bury
in talks with foreign diplomats and
migrant representatives.
Mr. Bury pointed out that a good
deal of the unfavorable reaction from
some European Governments and local
migrant elements had come before the
provisions of the legislation had been
announced. But he did not anticipate
any serious retaliation from any of the
foreign governments who might still be
critical. Nor did the Government expect
any serious attempt to challenge the
right under international law of the
Australian Government to enforce the
legislation. The law was “sufficiently
fluffy” on the rights of nationals living
abroad . for Government legal authori-
ties to feel confident on this point.
Since the legislation as it stood might
favor the richer alien who wanted to
return home rather than register, would
the Government consider any assistance
for those who could not afford the
fare? “I don’t know, quite frankly,”
said Mr. Bury. There were a number
of administrative details which the Gov-
ernment still had to finalise. It would
still be some 16 months before the first
aliens would be directly affected.
SAM LIPSKI
The Phuoc Tuy Command
U.S. General Westmoreland and Australia’s Maj.-Gen. K. Mackay-Who’s in
control?
WHEN Prime Minister Harold Holt announced the trebling of the Australian
military commitment in Vietnam last March, he made a statement on wh»
would command the Australian forces. Last week the Minister for Defence,
Alan Fairhall, made another.
Placed side by side the two state-
ments reveal considerable confusion as
to just who is in charge in Vietnam.
In March, Mr. Holt said: “Measuring
the availability of Australian troops in
the light of our other commitments
and in consultation with our allies, and
at the request of the Government of
South Vietnam, the Government has
decided that the existing battalion will
be replaced by a self-contained Aus-
tralian task force under Australian com-
mand embracing all personnel serving
there . . .
Thereafter, Government spokesmen
said that one of the reasons for choosing
this particular size force was that it
would enable Australian troops to be
in the charge of Australian officers.
They gave currency to the belief that
Australian troops would no longer be
P* g enera l allied forces. _
This was, of course, always an im- .
practicality because of the small size
of our force in relation to the total
number of fighting men involved
4500 out of 1,000,000. But for weeks
the Government equivocated and re-
fused to produce . any clear definition
of command relationships. Finally, last
week a document emerged, a piece of
bureaucratese in the name of Mr. Fair-
It started by saying that U.S. General
Westmoreland, being Allied Theatre
Commander, was with agreement of
the Australian Government in “opera-
tional control” of Australian forces,
Australian forces were controlled by
Major-General Mackay, and the Army
Task Force Commander, Brigadier
Jackson, had “operational control” of
major Army and RAAF combat units,
The statement in various forms
bounced back and forwards between
Defence, External Affairs, Saigon, and
the Minister before being released; and
no one seems t 0 have realised the
textual ambiguities which remained with
both tde American and the Australian
commander having “operational
control.”
In f ac j position seems to be that
in day to day oper ations our men will
usually operate as a self-contained unit.
Xhe only exception to this is that be-
cause of the absurdly small number of
helicopters they possess—enough to
transport only a platoon at one time—
they will often have t 0 call on the
Americans for air-mobility. But within
a quite sizaWe area of Phuoc Xuy
province they have a primary respon-
sibility and control,
Usually they will operate in this area
—around the expanding port of Vung
Tau—by themselves, and if other small
units enter they will be subject to clear-
ance by the Australian command post.
If the Viet Cong were to appear in
force, then General Westmoreland’s
position would become meaningful. For

ating in small units and can cope on
their own.
The big battles wdth the Viet Cong
working at battalion and regimental
strength are occurring in the North and
in the central highlands and coastal
regions close to the outlets of infiltra-
tion routes. Paradoxically, Australians
might have a tougher time were the

stage of dispersed guerilla warfare.
PETER SAMUEL
A Foreign Affairs Election
APART from State Aid ( now resolved) nothing has divided the Labor Party
more in recent years than foreign affairs and defence. Prime Minister Harold
Holt must have had a pleasant realisation of this when he announced Novem-
ber 26 as the tentative date for the Federal elections.
Asked on what issues he thought the
election would be fought Holt gently
pointed out that Opposition Leader
Mr. Arthur Calwell had almost daily
announced that he regarded the major
issues as foreign affairs and defence.
If divided viewpoints among one’s
political opponents are important in
deciding elections and Australian
political history suggests they are very
important - Holt's acceptance of de-
Holt and Ky election issues
fence, foreign affairs, and Vietnam
policies as the major issues is justified.
As if to underline Labor’s basic dif-
ferences even on the Vietnam issue,
Deputy Opposition - Leader Gough
Whitla,m on the same night as Holt
announced the tentative election date
was reported extensively on what he
was saying in Vietnam.
There is no doubt that the policy on
which Labor will go to the electors
on November 26 is that a Labor Gov-
ernment when elected will return to
Australia all national servicemen at
present stationed in Vietnam as soon
as possible and follow that up with
the return of all Australian servicemen
as soon as arrangements can be made
with the South Vietnamese Government
and the United States. Not only has
this policy been consistently stated, but
in a recent TV interview Calwell said
it would not be changed by a comma
when it was put to the Australian
voters.
When reported on the night of Holt’s
election announcement, however, Whit-
lam said something quite different. He
praised the performance of the Aus-
tralian servicemen in Vietnam, which
is a neutral thing to do. But then he
got stuck into the Holt Government
for not providing more massive civil
aid in Vietnam. He claimed this aid
should be allocated in proximity to
the area occupied by Australian ser-
vicemen in Vietnam. The Australian
servicemen had been given the responsi-
bility for helping with civilian aid in
their area. But they had neither the
men nor the time to spare from their
combat duties. Superficially all this
points to a quite different approach by
Calwell and Whitlam. Calwell wants
all Australian servicemen out as soon
as practical. Whitlam is calling for a
build-up of civil aid that will enable
Australian forces to concentrate upon
their military duties.
This basic conflict of viewpoint has
now lasted for ten years. One section
of the Federal Parliamentary Labor
Party and it could be the majority
section sees eye to eye with the
Government on quite a wide range of
foreign affairs and defence policies.
Another section of this Labor Party is
implacably opposed to the Govern-
ment’s foreign affairs and de-
fence policies not only in detail but
fundamentally. It has by and large
been this section of the party (which
owes its strength to the fact that a
majority of those in control of the
ALP Federal machine hold similar
viewpoints) which has decided what
should be Labor’s official policy on
these issues.
Actually, if you look back, Labor
has been singularly unlucky in its fore-
casts, particularly on foreign affairs.
I can remember Labor spokesmen
being very uneasy about the use of
Australian troops in Malaysia. They
could see all kinds or dire consequences
emerging. But what has happened?
Communist infiltration of Malaysia
has ended without a military dictator-
ship taking over the area as was once
feared. In fact the present Prime
Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan-yew,
is a Socialist who believes that small
Asian nations have rights as well as
large Asian nations.
Indonesia has not been forced into
alliance with Communist China al-
though it might well have been if things
had gone otherwise and the Com-
munist infiltration of Malaysia had
been successful, or even if Vietnam had
been overrun by Communist aggression
from the North. Confrontation between
Indonesia and Malaysia has formally
ended, and there is an opportunity for
the rebuilding of the area in an at-
mosphere of goodwill and peace. Elec-
tions are to be held in South Vietnam.
Even if they are rigged (as Dr. Jim
Cairns, newly returned from Vietnam,
alleges they are going to be), at least
this is an improvement on no elections,
or a one-party system of election
frozen into an uncompromising social
system in Communist countries, even
(as recent events show) in devia-
tionist countries like Yugoslavia. Rig-
ging and abuses can be corrected. A
one-party system is self-perpetuating.
The list of inaccurate Labor forecasts
since the Left Wing took control of
Labor’s foreign policy-making and its
approach to Australia’s defence prob-
lems can be extended almost indefin-
itely. It was in the knowledge that this
had been the case for some years that
Holt smiled benignly as he announced
that he was prepared to pick up Cal-
well’s challenge to fight on foreign
affairs and defence issues.

Death and the Amphometer
SOMETHING strange is happening on Victorian roads, always the most
dangerous per mile in the Commonwealth. Reversing universal trends, they
are becoming less dangerous.
To the end of July, the State had
scored almost 1000 fewer reported ac-
cidents this year: 20,029 in the first
seven months of 1965, down to 19,076
in the first seven months of this year.
Atid road deaths were down 12: to July
31 last year 573 people were killed,
i . , r C ,
but this years tally was only 561.

are in no doubt that the
reason for all this is the little metal
box that gives electronic evidence
against speedsters the amphometer.
Costing only $260 apiece, there are
now 19 in use in the State, mostly in
and around Melbourne. Since the first
was used 18 months ago, they have
been used to book more than 12,000 too-
fast drivers. Their irrefutable convict-
ing evidence has been responsible for
offenders pouring $250,000 in fines into
the Treasury. To this must also be
added about ten percent extra in fines
for other offences detected when the
speedsters have been booked—stolen
cars, driving under the influence, or
without licence or registration.
“And this is only the beginning,”
Superintendent George McCulloch,
chief of the Victoria Police Traffic
Branch, said with bright seriousness.
“Already traffic everywhere is slowing
down. The amphometer’s biggest success
is going to be a psychological one.
People know we have them and how
efficient they are, so their driving is
better and slower. In a few months the
results will be more dramatic and people
will notice an appreciable drop in mis-
haps.”
These weekends, since the police got
12 new meters last month, they are
booking up to 1000 motorists for speed-
with the aid of the little boxes.

is more than doubled. As the months
. £ ,
progress, these figures should start reced-
ing. Motorists will have got the mes-
sage an d have slowed down, as they’re
already starting to do appreciably. But
Supt. McCulloch believes it will be up
to two years before the boxes reach
maximum effect.
The day I spent at the Traffic
Branch’s headquarters at suburban
Brunswick, a police crew came in after
liearly two hours on duty with their
box in busy Pascoe Vale Rd. They had
booked only seven speedsters. A few
weeks ago, at the same time and spot,
their tally in three hours had been 51.
The amphometer — — Auto-Miles Per
Hour-OMETER is the invention of
47-year-old Mr. Ray Eichler, a local
electronics engineer who, when he is
not tinkering with things in his back-
yard workshop, works as a PMG engin-
eer - His meter is linked electrically with
two hollow rubber tubes that straddle
roadways exactly 88ft. apart. The boxed
meter is a 12-volt transistorised affair,
powered by eight ordinary torch bat-
teries. When a car runs over the first
rubber tube, electric energy is released
in the box, passing through a series of
coils and causing a needle to start
Victorian Traffic Branch police check the amphometer.
crossing the face of the instrument,
which is marked off from zero to 160
mph. Impact on the second tube about
a second later a- car doing 60 mph
covers 88ft. in an exact second cuts
off the supply of electricity and the
needle halts at a point which shows
the car’s exact speed through the meas-
ured 88ft.
Every six months, each machine goes
to Melbourne University for testing and
sealing. The 88ft. road sections are
measured by a metal tape whose
accuracy is certified by the State
Weights and Measures Dept. As well,
before the meter starts duty, a police
car with a known accurate speedo runs
a few times over the course at different
speeds to make sure the meter gives
accurate readings. Similar tests are done
every half hour the meter is being used.
Police know they must be 100 percent
accurate with their court evidence. They
have already gone through the initiation
of having some magistrates refusing to
record convictions from evidence based
on meter readings. Special legislation
passed by the Government six months
ago removed all grounds for scepticism
and there have been no hitches since.
Mr. Eichler’s invention is
spreading. Western Australia now
has 16 meters and is starting to get
results similar to Victoria’s. There is
one in Darwin and the Department of
the Interior has one in Canberra for
traffic surveys. New South Wales and
Tasmanian police have experimented
with them and the New Zealand and
Malaysian Governments have made de-
tailed inquiries.
Magistrates, now happy with meter
evidence, are playing their part in the
campaign to stamp out road madness.
Police charge only what they call the
“cream” of speedsters; they ignore the
man doing only one or two miles over
the limit. Offenders doing up to ten
mph above the limit can pay a $lO fine
without going to court. Anything over
this brings a summons and a court
hearing with fines usually between $2O
and $4O. Anyone guilty of more than
15 mph over the limit runs a risk of
having his licence suspended or can-
celled. The amphometer has also re-
sulted in quicker court hearings. Police
spend about five minutes explaining
where and how the meter was set up
and tested and then the cases zip
through at an average of two minutes
for each. In pre-meter days, the aver-
age hearing time for speed offences was
ten minutes.
When they get waved down about
100 yards beyond the second rubber
tube, most drivers are philosophical
about being charged. They are always
invited to come and see for themselves
the speed they registered on the meter,
as the meter needle stays locked on its
reading until the booking is made. A
few whinge about “unfairness” or com-
plain that they know how to drive
safely even if they do exceed the limit.
Many stay on to watch the meter in
action catching others. Police do not
mind, accepting this as good public re-


lations for their work. Occasionally,
they have trouble with smart alecks
who put up “police trap” signs along
the road to warn motorists or others,
when they have a night operation, who
sneak on to the road to cut up their
tubes, rendering them useless. But they
are prepared for the odd motor cyclist
aleck who will sometimes try to rip
up the tube with his foot as he rides
past. The tubes are anchored to the
roadway and this often results in a spill
for the cyclist.

"The Greek Government retaliated!"
Asian Lawyers
THE setting-up of a Law Association
for Asia and the Western Pacific
in Canberra last week was a
dramatic demonstration of what can
be achieved in regional co-operation.
And it happened in spite of doubts
among some officials in the Depart-
ment of External Affairs.
Living with Asia has been so much
a theme of public discussion in Aus-
tralia that it has become fine of those
ordinary phrases which tends to
anaesthetise the mind and make for
inaction.
This has certainly been true at the
Government level where few initiatives
have been taken in promoting regional
co-operation and in efforts to create
the institutions which are required for
integrated economic development. Aus-
tralian officials just seem reluctant to
take regional initiatives^
Certainly, Australia joined the
Economic Commission for Asia and the
Far East, but late; we have gone into
the Asian Development Bank, once it
was clear that it was under way. And
Mr. Hasluck went to the ASPAC meet-
ing in Seoul although he took no pro-
posals with him and opposed the estab-
lishment of any new non-Communist
regional organisation. At SEATO
recently the Australian official team was
highly regarded for its competent hand-
ling of administrative work and organi-
sation. But again there were ho new
ideas or initiatives.
Australians privately have been far
more constructive and bold. Under
Community Aid Abroad almost a hun-
dred Australian communities participate
quite intimately in the development
efforts of villages in India and Korea.
Australia’s “Peace Corps,” Australian
Volunteers Abroad, was started and put
on its feet by a private citizen, Mr.
Jim Webb, although the Government
has since provided some finance.
And now the new law association.
This was the work of three prominent
Australian lawyers, Messrs. Toose, Kerr,
and Piggot, over a period of five years.
This new regional body promises to
promote a great deal of urgently needed
research as well as facilitating pro-
fessional exchange. The notable thing
about the effort so far has been the
lack of any phony deference to the
other countries of the region although
they were fully involved.
The 18 countries who have agreed
to form the association have diverse
legal systems and extend geographically
from Afghanistan to Western Samoa.
When Mr. Justic Kerr opened the con-
ference he .made the familiar point,
but one which bears repeating, that the
countries of the area could no longer
afford the luxury of isolationist policies.
Among the objectives of the new
association are promoting uniformity
within the region in appropriate fields
of law and encouraging relations be-
tween lawyers. This latter objective
may seem obvious enough, but it has a
special significance for many of the
newer nations of Asia where lawyers
are their most important elites in poli-
tics, government, and administration.
From the beginning, the association
was an Australian initiative, and its or-
ganisation and day-to-day direction will
continue for the immediate future to
be run by the Australian Secretary-
General from headquarters in Sydney.


Because of its importance, THE BULLETIN is running at length this edited
transcript of a recent Sydney seminar on Communist China. The main speaker
was Professor Richard L. Walker, Director of the Institute of International Studies
at the University of South Carolina and the author of “China Under Communism
The First Five Years” and “The Continuing Struggle Communist China
and the Free World.” The discussion was opened by Mr. Gregory Clark, a Research
Fellow in the Department of International Relations at the Australian National
University, who last year resigned from the Department of External Affairs
because he disagreed with the Australian Government’s policy on China. The
seminar was organised by the Australian Association for Cultural Freedom.
ONE might begin by asking just what
is China? Is it the magnificent
display of organisational strength
and ability that takes place for foreign
guests every August Ist and October
Ist? Is it the country that concludes a
steel deal with West Germany? Is it
the China that invades India in 1962
in a superb combination of military and
political play and disrupts the politics
of all South Asia? Is it the land of
Confucius? Is it the land of tradi-
tional, or totalitarian despotic rule? Or
is it the land of the trader, of the
Chinese businessman who is known so
well in S.E. Asia?
Is it the land of the great purge
which has confounded the predictions
of many experts?
What is happening in China now?
As you may know, in the U.S. in the
past year there has been a great interest
in China and China policy. And our
Senate Foreign Relations Committee
called before it, as witnesses, some of
the finest scholars in the China field in
the U.S. This was a very useful exercise,
because in contrast with the former
period the McCarthy period when
we were investigating China policy,
there was no name-calling or question-
ing of motives. These were serious and
earnest people searching for answers to
problems of policy. There was far more
agreement than we had expected. There
was, for example, complete agreement
about the nature of the regime. But
there were a number of other issues
which emerged from the Fulbright
hearings, and I will mention five of
these issues.
One which immediately arose, par-
ticularly in connection with the testi-
mony of a very eminent American
historian, Professor John Fairbank, of
Harvard, was the question: “Is China
behaving according to traditional inter-
ests, her traditional sphere of concern
and pattern of conduct, or is Com-
munist China behaving as Communist
rather than Chinese, putting its major
emphasis on its world-wide commit-
ment to revolutionary violence?” On
this particular issue the experts were
divided.
This led to a second question. Is
their ideology just words? At one time,
Chen Yi, the Foreign Minister, said
to some foreigners: “Don’t judge us
by what we say, but by what we do.”
This happened to be at the time he
was seeking to conclude a business
deal and some people were wondering
about the continuity of financial com-
mitments.
Now if there is general agreement
that the words are harsh and the
ambitions bold, there is less agreement
about their real meaning. Neverthe-
less, a number of points, brought up
toward the end of the hearings, in-
dicate that, just as Adolf Hitler and
his party later acted according to the
words of “Mein Kampf,” the Chinese
Communists do intend to act accord-
ing to their own words and their own
projections of their view of the world.
A number of items did not emerge
in the Fulbright Committee hearings.
There was, for example, the procla-
mation in December of 1964, from
Peking quoting Hanoi (but broadcast
first from Peking rather than Hanoi),
of the Thailand Liberation Front
the plan for the liberation of Thailand
and the beginning in late December,
1964, and early 1965 of some scattered
assassinations of village leaders in
north-east Thailand. Shortly after, the
Chinese Communists surfaced a former
Thai Foreign Minister, who had once
before delivered over Radio Peking
a rather provocative broadcast calling
for the liberation of Thailand. Shortly
after, and again rebroadcast this past
January and February, the Malayan
Liberation Front was given full sup-
port by the Peking government and
promised officially, in statements by
Radio Peking, logistic support for the
liberation of the Malayan people.
One could say: “All right, but these
are traditional Chinese areas of in-
fluence,” Malaya not so much, but
Thailand perhaps. “Traditional areas of
influence” is another aspect of a words
versus deeds issue; what the Soviets
have called cartographic aggression
and what the Indians have worried
about. The Chinese have published a
number of maps showing traditional
Chinese areas to include all of main-
land S.E. Asia (and they have not
hesitated to refer to Eastern Siberia,,
particularly the maritime province, as
“lands taken from the Chinese by
Tsarist imperialists”).
But the major point which is being
raised by, among others, Professor
Robert Scalapino, of the University of
California, is that Chinese deeds in
Africa offer the convincing proof that
the Chinese intend to live up to their
words and their promises to spread
their version of liberation around the
world. The Chinese Communist
regime (and China has not traditionally
been that interested in Africa) has
committed some $U.5.300 million in
aid programs to Africa, a fair portion
of which is for military assistance.
Further they have been shipping arms
and advisers, and training cadres for
assassination, for demolition, and, in-
deed, for political activism in Central
Africa to the point where a great
number of African leaders have been
greatly disturbed. In fact, by December
’65 and January ’66 three African States
had broken off relations with main-
land China and charged the Chinese
Communists with attempting to inter-
fere in and encourage violence and
revolution within their countries.
Then came the revelations in Feb-
ruary and March of this year of what
was actually going on in Ghana. It
was not only that the Chinese and the
Soviets were to some extent co-operat-
ing to train political activists to over-
throw Africa but that major training
in violence and a preparation for
peoples’ wars was being conducted in
a secret camp north of Accra, in Ghana,


MAO'S CHINA
How grave a threat?
primarily by the Chinese. The
Ghanaian Government is currently put-
ting on display a number of the items
involved. The argument which I would
like to suggest to you (and I haven’t
even mentioned the Chinese complicity
in events in Indonesia) is that Mao
Tse-tung and company do indeed in-
tend to honor their words with deeds.
This being the case, the third question
to come up in the Fulbright hearings
was the problem of containment. Can
one contain the outward thrust of a
tremendously powerful people under
this kind of a regime?
On this, contrary to Senator Ful-
bright’s expectations, practically every
witness argued that as far as Vietnam
was concerned we now had little
choice. No single scholar before the
Fulbright Committee hearings, includ-
ing those who disagreed with U.S.
foreign policy on some issues, called
for the withdrawal of the U.S. com-
mitment in Vietnam.
Now this led to a fourth major area
of consideration, namely, what is the
role of the United States? A number
of items have entered into a division of
U.S. policy. There are, first of all, those
led by, among others, Professor Hans
Morgenthau, George Kennan, and
Walter Lippmann (although the latter
two were not witnesses before the Ful-
bright Committee hearings), who main-
tain that the U.S. remains an Atlantic
Power; that the major centre of power
and interest is in Europe, in the NATO
alliance; that Americans are dispersing
our strength, that we are over-com-
mitted in Asia, that Vietnam and
China don’t matter and therefore the
U.S. should get out of this commit-
ment.
group argued that the
U.S. is a Pacific Power and as a
Pacific Power we are on what seems to
be a collision course with mainland
China. They argued on what we some-
times refer to in the U.S. as the Equal
Guilt Complex; that somehow, by a
combination of errors, both the U.S.
and Communist China have been re-
sponsible for this impasse, and that the
U.S. is equally responsible for the
harsh cries from Peking. The third
group, with which I would associate
myself, argued that the U.S. is a Pacific
Power; that if we had any doubts about
this, Pearl Harbor and the Korean War
should have awakened us to this; that
with regard to the Equal Guilt Complex
people don’t read history. The U.S. and
its allies had at the end of World War
II disbanded the most formidable mili-
tary machine in history and attempted
to withdraw into some semblance of
peace, with great hopes placed in the
UN. We had even indicated that we
would not get involved in a war for
the defence of Taiwan and Korea.
South Korea was at one time by impli-
cation excluded from our sphere of
influence, until the awakening of June
25, 1950. The U.S. is involved in East
Asia; we are a Pacific Power, we may
not be an Asian Power, but as a
Pacific Power we are reminded that
oceans connect, and we are deeply con-
nected and involved in the areas of the
Western Pacific.
If one examines the role of the U.S.
one comes to the fifth question which
really disturbed the Fulbright Com-
mittee. This has to do with spheres
of influence. The more involved argued
that this area is a natural sphere of
influence for the Chinese, and that the
U.S. is risking world war, and getting
involved in problems it has no right to
get involved in, by attempting to inter-
fere. It was just this kind of logic
which led the U.S. and Western powers
to justify Japanese aggression at the
early stages when it could have been
stopped-
The phrase in agreements at that
time was: “territorial propinquity
creates actual interest,” and it was in
line with this thesis that Japanese ex-
pansion into Korea was justified and
indeed that the European Powers
eventually accepted the Japanese take-
over of Manchuria, which had occurred
on September 18, 1931.
Now just the mention of five of these
issues that came up before the Ful-
bright Committee hearings indicates
some of the vastness and complexity of
the question of China and China policy.
This is a land with tremendous prob-
lems which may be greater than any
regime can really deal with effectively
in the short run. These are problems of
agrarian production, of weather and
climate, of limitations of raw materials,
and particularly of population.
The Chinese Communists are facing
a Malthusian counter-revolution. In the
19605, if the Chinese mainland pro-
ceeds at the same rate of growth and
population, namely 2.22 percent, which
they gave as their increase during their
first five-year plan, it will add more
people to its already overburdened
country than there are people in the
U.S. today.
When they talk about economic plan-
ning, they must talk in terms not alone
of improving steel or agricultural pro-
duction of fertiliser, they have to think
in terms of feeding an increase of 15
to 16 million people per year. This is
enough to stagger any regime.
Then there are the problems of
power the power of the regime. In
talking about the vastness and com-
plexity of China, one must give the
devil his due.
lf pHE Chinese Communists, under the
solidified leadership which per-
sisted, at least in token, up until per-
haps a year ago, did well. But in the
struggle for succession and the great
purge going on now they got a more
thorough control over more people in
a shorter time than any regime in the
history of the world. Ruthless it was,
efficient it was, and in some respects
frightening. How were they able to do
this? In many respects what they did
was build a modern totalitarian State;
and herein lies the danger.
It is here that we have, I think,
one of our greatest difficulties in un-
derstanding mainland China today.
The problem is not whether it is his-
toric China; it is in many respects, be-
cause the government of any country
cannot dispense with the culture of the
people it rules. When Mao Tse-tung
promises his heaven on earth, he says,
“Da tung,” which is a Confucian ex-
pression, stemming from the great
learning of the work of Confucius, and
he cannot help this feeling in a lan-
guage of Confucius and his culture.
It is Chinese; it is also Communist.
Mao Tse-tung and his colleagues speak
in the language of Marxism and Len-
inism and they are committed to world'
revolution. But far more important, and
an item that was overlooked in the
Committee hearings, is the institutional
factor in this case, of modern
totalitarianism. Totalitarian regimes
have a way of throwing a society out
of balance. Societies, be they demo-
cratic or as authoritarian as the tradi-
tional Chinese despotism (with its sav-
ing grace Confucian humanism), achieve
within themselves a certain measure of
balance. A totalitarian regime seizes
upon certain characteristics and utilises


them, exploits them, and throws the
society out of balance. Many of the
aspects of social life continue, but the
society itself is thrown out of whack.
In 1936 the Germans held the Olym-
pic Games in Berlin. A great number
of people went to see the new Germans,
and they found that these were the
same German people who sang the won-
derful songs and drank beer, and they
were interested in music and so forth.
A great number came back and said:
“This can’t be as bad as all the pub-
licists say it is. We have been and seen
for ourselves the young men are
enthusiastic; prices have been levelled;
the inflation’s over; it’s a nation that’s
going to make a contribution to peace.”
What they were doing was judging
the regime on the basis of the culture
it inherited.
This is precisely what has happened
to a very tragic people, the Chinese,
who have known nothing but warfare
for the past century and a quarter.
We have had difficulty in the West-
ern World in accepting the simple fact
of modern totalitarianism; that it is a
unique form of political control; that it
belongs to the 20th century; that it
deserves and needs our analysis as a
unique type of political institution.
What is more, we have had even greater
difficulty despite all the evidence, pre-
sented whether by Khrushchev or others,
that all totalitarianism, of the Right or
the Left, belongs to the same species.
What is totalitarianism? We have
barely begun in Western political
science to deal with this as a unique
phenomenon, because we haven’t had
that many examples of it.
[ WOULD suggest that there are a
number of distinguishing character-
istics of a totalitarian system, which, if
we were to set up on a scale and grade
from zero to 100, would enable us to
draw a pattern for an assessment for
various regimes. On such a scale, main-
land China in its current very tragic
state of frenetic detachment from
reality is as intense and dangerous a
totalitarian regime as the world has
had to face up to. In many respects,
mainland China today because it
does live in a .fantasy world peopled
with forces of light and black: revolu-
tionary/reactionary; revolutionary/re-
visionary, and so forth is every bit
as dangerous as ultra-nationalist Japan
was in the late 19305. People somehow
didn’t believe that then after all, the
Japanese were rational people and the
U.S. had more trade with Japan than
with almost any other country, and you
don’t go to war with countries you
trade with. The U.S. and others would
never have believed that a rational
country we attribute rationality to
the totalitarians, but all too frequently
this is a mistake would dare to take
on all of the Western powers in the
Western Pacific.
The attack on Pearl Harbor was the
height of irrationality it was a tragic
misjudgment.
Now what are these characteristics?
The first is an official, all-pervasive
ideology, an ideology which is used to
interpret all aspects of the world, all
aspects of the society, and the more
monolithic it is, the more total the
regime. This has reached the ultimate
in the present regime on mainland
China.
The “People’s Daily” throughout the
month of June was full of complete
pages recalling how people from Bel-
gium to Chile had decided to make the
thought of Mao Tse-tung their great
guide for all their actions in the future.
On page 2 of the “People’s Daily” last
May there was a very amusing story
of how by studying one of Mao’s mag-
nificent works a night-soil gatherer had
been able to improve her quota and
gather up much more night soil as a
part of her daily work.
Linked with this ideology comes a
necessary accompaniment—and we have
watched this in the case of Hitler, of
Stalin, of the Japanese emperor —the
elevation of the leadership cult. The
leadership cult in mainland China to-
day has gone to such ludicrous extremes
that it has become the symbol of the
Chinese detachment from the real
world. The current struggle for suc-
cession is being argued in terms of who
supports the thought of the leader more.
The leadership cult and the thought of
the leader have become a method for
asserting Chinese superiority in the
world. Everyone, the people are told,
now looks to Mao for leadership in the
world revolution.
The problem of the leadership cult
is that this, more than any other item,
can lead to irrational action. When
there is a fully entrenched leadership
cult, only reports of successes and vic-
tories go to the top; few question, or
dare question, the effectiveness of
policies; the leader himself becomes de-
tached from the real world and con-
vinced that he can make no mistakes.
The megalomania of the aging autocrat
has become the standard feature of life
in mainland China today.
Linked with the leadership cult is
another item, the elite which holds
within its hands all the power. In
mainland China today, this is the
Chinese Communist Party. One must
understand this to understand how
China is ruled.
The formal government is hardly
important at all. The formal govern-
ment in mainland China is meaning-
less. The Party rules. As the official
textbook in Political Theory published
some five years ago on mainland China
puts it: “Our Party is the Party that
runs the State.” If you have this kind
of rule by an elite, and the Chinese
Communist Party is rather a cumber-
some elite (it has probably passed the
20 million mark in membership, 20
million disciplined fanatics headed by a
single God), then the next aspect of
this elite rule is that it becomes an
arbitrary rule.
The ruling of China has been dis-
cussed in great detail by a group of
people who have not been overly noted
for their impeccable attention to a rule
of law or obeying their own standards,
namely the Soviet Union. The Soviet
leaders have been among the harshest
critics of the departure from socialist
legality (as they put it) on the part of
the Chinese leadership. They don’t even
obey their own Party Constitution,
which calls for yearly meetings of the
People’s Congress. This Congress is
supposed to debate and publish a
budget and state plans. The last Con-
gresses, for the past five years, have
been held in absolute secrecy with no
plans, no figures, and no budget
adopted. They merely meet to hear the
word of the rulers.
F one has this kind of rule, the next
item which characterises mainland
China is the monopoly control of
communications. There are no un-
official communications in mainland
China. The Press, the radio, everything"
is monopolised by the Party, and only a
single line goes out Then there is the
build-up of the secret police and the
military. The Chinese have not only
devoted material resources (which
should have been channelled into fer-
tiliser plants and the livelihood of the
people, and could have made the rulers-
popular) into the building up of mili-
tary power in a formidable manner,,
they have even moved themselves, with
three atomic explosions, into the ranks
of the atomic powers. All this has been
done and is linked with necessity for
secrecy. If the Soviet Union was “a
riddle wrapped in an ■enigma” for Sir
Winston Churchill, the Chinese Com-
munist Regime is currently even more
so for its former Soviet allies.
Secrecy has been made such a fetish
that at one time, a leading economist
(during the 100 Flowers period) com-
plained, the outside imperial powers,
and more particularly the U.S., had
more knowledge of what was going
on in mainland China’s economy than
did the economists working for the Gov-
ernment. He was liquidated (so to
speak) in the anti-writers’ campaign
that followed. This secrecy has been
carried to such an extreme that only a
few official newspapers and journals are
permitted to be circulated outside the
Chinese mainland and those people
seeking any sort of figures or statistics
of any aspect of the economy are
stunned by the lack of data. Some four
years ago the “People’s Daily” pub-
lished a warning to the high-ranking
cadres of the Chinese Communist Party
which began: “Certain comrades have
shown a tendency to find out about
things they are not supposed to know
about. This practice should be stopped
forthwith.” How do you know what
you are not supposed to know?
The article went on to explain that to
the bewildered party cadres that if

we don't tell you about it, you shouldn’t
find out about it. Linked with all this
is an item that the Chinese have de-
veloped much more efficaciously and
efficiently than the Soviets— the mass
organisations, based on the small study
group. No one, from kindergarten age
to the very top, escapes from the process
of mutual supervision and control in a
study group. Everyone, whether it is a
sister in the school, or brother in the
factory, or father out in the rice paddy,
belongs to a study group.
These are the groups that launch the
mass campaigns and the mass drives.
When Chairman Mao calls for a mass
demonstration in support of the negro
people’s struggle against U.S. imperial-
ism and oppression in the U.S. and the
papers then report that some 30 million
people participated in these demonstra-
tions, the figures are probably not
exaggerated. The mass organisations
have led to a form of social pulverisa-
tion. There are no unofficial organisa-
tions or contacts in mainland China
today. Everything is monopolised by
the regime.
All this would not be so bad if there
were not the projection of this kind of
mentality on to the world scene, because
an essential element in totalitarianism is
the permanent purge, the We-They
mentality, the necessity for internal
pariahs and external enemies to bolster
the control of those in power. In the
external projection and in the internal
life of China today everything is divided
into two. In everything that exists
there are two antagonistic and hostile
forces, and it will be so until the
world-wide Communist victory; there-
fore, anyone who attempts to propose
some sort of accommodation or adjust-
ment is, by the very nature of the
system and the ideology necessary for
totalitarians, an enemy or a conspirator.
This we find difficult to believe, but
this is where we fall down in reading
the language and we simply cannot be-
lieve that they mean what they say in
their words.
All this indicated that we are deal-
ing with the type of regime, State, and
institution which is not necessarily
amenable to the normal diplomatic or
organisational forces. This is where, it
seems to me, a number of people raise
false expectations about the future with
mainland China. For example, there
has been much discussion in the U.S.
about the possibility of expanding un-
official relations with mainland China,
with some sort of vague hope that
through our smiling faces and our ex-
change of opinions we are going to
have some impact on the direction of
this regime One cannot rule this out
entirely, but we had great exchanges
with ultra-nationalist Japan; tourists
tripped in and out of Japan right up
to the last minute before Pearl Harbor,
and yet it did not have any impact
on the institutional direction of Jap-
anese policy. The same could be said
of Hitler’s Germany.
Then there is the problem of trade.
Can we possibly divert a regime like
this by trading? Here again there is
faint hope. Britain and Germany were
each other’s greatest trading partner
almost before two world wars. The
U.S. and Japan were trading almost to
the last minute, and did this have any
impact on the direction of the Jap-
anese nationalists? What we had failed
to understand was modern totalitari-
anism as a unique system. Sydney and
Beatrice Webb went to the Soviet
Union at the height of the famine in
1933 and came back and reported to
the British people that they had seen
the future and that it worked.
There are real dangers. This regime
in its current state of frenzy, under the
current purge, where anyone with any
brains is being distrusted or ousted,
is capable of tragically irrational action.
In some respects their complicity in
Indonesia last September 30-October 1
might be judged almost as an irrational
action. Their current movement to do
away with private plots, private live-
stock, and indeed return to the more
rigorous system of the communes can,
in view of what happened before, only
be viewed as an irrational attempt to
maintain the infallibility of the All-
Saviour-Dictator. The irrationality is
seen in their dispute with the Soviet
Union, or in the dispute with India. It
appears today that this regime is like
a madman caught in a padded cell and
everyone is wrong: Castro is wrong,
the Soviets are wrong, the Indians are
wrong, the British, the U.S., the Jap-
anese, everyone is wrong but the per-
son caught in the thralldom of his own
self-contemplation.
And with irrationality comes the pos-
sibility for misjudgment. Here the
regime has made two tragic mistakes.
They have misjudged the United States.
If we ever persuaded any of their
leaders to come to the U.S. and they
saw the U.S., they might still judge or
misjudge us in terms even more dan-
gerous; once a visit to the United States
was over, they might say this civilisa-
tion will never support an effort in East
Asia over a long period of time. This
is precisely what the Japanese did in
their reports to their Foreign Office as
a result of their many visits and. talks
in the United States in 1941. Secondly,
there is a possibility of the misjudg-
ment of the tremendous revolution that
has taken place outside China. It is
not China any longer that is the revo-
lutionary civilisation.
REVOLUTION has taken place in
South Korea in just the past 18
months one of the most dramatic
I have ever seen in Asia. One of tre-
mendous proportion has taken place in
Japan, one which has cut the ground
away from the argument on which Mao
still relies the Leninist theory of im-
perialism. Japan shed of its empire is
more prosperous than the Japanese
people ever dreamed of when they were
talking about a Greater East Asia Co-
Prosperity sphere. Taiwan is a more
prosperous province, or Chinese com-
munity, than the Chinese have ever
seen in any province at any time in
their history. The development of S.E.
Asia with the tragic exception of Viet-
nam also promises that these countries
are also moving, not into the world of
19th-century Leninist dogma but into
the world of the third quarter of the
20th century with computers, jet air-
craft, and the rest. The Chinese in their
reporting of the struggles going on be-
tween the forces of Good and Evil and
their attempts to sustain the infallibility
of their great new God are making
tragic mistakes.
The Chinese people remain an ener-
getic, remarkable people (although one
great attribute of theirs has been a
major casualty of the Communist
regime a sense of humor; they may
even get that back). This is a regime
which is extremely dangerous. How to
meet and avoid the danger? On this
we can expect that there will be great
differences. Our history with totali-
tarian regimes in the past makes only
one thing manifestly clear that until
the bubble of inevitability, the bubble
of infallibility is burst, until the out-
ward thrust is met and contained, until
the doctrine is shown up to be as
ridiculous as it is, the chances for

accommodation are slim indeed, and
our experience of dealing with the
totalitarians indicates that concessions
only make th.em bully forward to
demand more concessions.
Communist China is a major threat
a threat to its own people, a threat
to peace, and a danger to- the whole
world. This must be the inescapable
conclusion when one examines China as
a manifestation of modern totalitari-
anism. I wish I had a happier message.
Gregory Clark:
I first had the pleasure of meeting
Professor Walker in Hong Kong at
a conference in 1961, when a major
topic of discussion was the Sino-Soviet
dispute. The conclusions that were
generally reached at that conference, I
think, have been shown to be substan-
tially wrong. I think it is possible that
what we believe about China today may
also be disproved.
First, Professor Walker began by set-
ting various questions about the nature
of China and one of these was: “Is
China the land of Confucius?” Well,
the question I should like to ask is:
Is it becoming, in our imagination, the
land of Fu Manchu? We have this
idea of an aggressive expansionist
China, but now we have come to under-
stand the nature of the modern totali-
tarian State in the Soviet Union and
realise that it is not aggressive, or imme-
diately aggressive, are we instinctively
transferring our theories to another
part of the world’s surface?
WHAT the argument about the
nature of the Chinese regime
boils down to is not whether we have a
totalitarian State or not but whether
this totalitarian State exhibits the signs
and symptoms of the totalitarian States
of the past China, Japan, and Nazi
Germany in the 19305. Of course, the
facile answer to this, and I don’t apolo-
gise for putting it forward, is that China
does not have its “Manchuria,” it does
not have its “Sudetenland” and
“Czechoslovakia,” and until this hap-
pens I think we have to look much
more closely at what the Chinese do
and say before we can come to any
conclusions.
Professor Walker has given a very
extensive summary of the various in-
dications which are given of an ex-
pansionist and aggressive tendency on
the part of the Chinese regime. I first
became aware of these things when
sitting in Hong Kong for two years,
and it seemed to me rather an anomaly
that, labelled as expansionist and ex-
pansive as China was, it had done
nothing about Hong Kong. In fact,
the situation had arisen, whereby the
Soviet Union accused China of failing
to liberate its own people in Hong
Kong.
I think that to try to understand
China we have to look at it as a country
trying to establish its presence in the
world. The Chinese have done a
lot of things that we have the right
to consider sinister; for example, the
establishment of these camps in Ghana
for the training of people who will
serve Chinese interests. But the Chinese
could say that the U.S. have established
camps in Panama and Puerto Rico
for the training of anti-guerrilla experts
for Latin American countries. The
Chinese have provided a forum for
the so-called National Liberation
Movement of Thailand and for Com-
munist movements operating elsewhere
in Asia. But every year in New York
there is a meeting, which is sometimes
addressed by a senior American official,
which is dedicated to the liberation of
the “captured nations” of Eastern
Europe; in fact, I believe that at one
of these meetings the expression “ “to
roll back the fontiers of despotism” was
employed. Now a person looking at
these manifestations on the other side
of the Iron Curtain might come to
the same conclusion as we have come
to looking at what the Chinese are
doing. These are the external mani-
festations. Professor Walker mentioned
Indonesia as an example of what he
called Chinese irrationality. Well the
extent of Chinese complicity in In-
donesia has yet to be established, but
even if the Chinese were fully impli-.
cated, then I think that Professor
Walker’s phrase, which he has used
elsewhere, that “Indonesia is China’s
Bay of Pigs,” indicates that China is
possibly not the only power in the
world that can act irrationally in these
matters.
On the questions of the Sino-Soviet
dispute and the dispute with India, an
assessment of Chinese behaviour, or in-
tentions on the basis of these incidents,
will depend on what we believe was
actually involved. It could be argued
that the Sino-Soviet dispute in 1962-63
with its intensity was a move intended
to unseat Khrushchev, that, if they
realised his basic internal weakness,
they were making all attempts to dis-
credit him in the hope that he would
be replaced by someone more amenable
to the Chinese position. This I don’t
think would necessarily be an irrational
act an assessment at this stage of
Khrushchev’s basic weakness was in
fact what a lot of Kremlinologists in
the West were making. The Indian dis-
pute can be assessed as being purely
and simply a border dispute in which
China had limited territorial aims
and by action on the Indian frontier it
gained its objectives in a very quick
and sudden-death manner. In power
politics this need not be an act of
irrationality.
Where there is much more doubt is
where we have to assess the internal
behaviour of the Chinese, and Professor
Walker has given some very alarming
indications of the growing totalitarian
trends. I am inclined to agree that there
are some very disturbing indications.
However, when he talks about a society
and a culture being thrown out of gear,
so to speak, was not this inevitable if
the Chinese were going to have the sort
of industrialisation that we consider as
normal in our Western societies? In con-
nection with this, he mentioned
Buddhism. Well any Communist State
is going to take a high line on religion,
but it is a fact that to this day the
Chinese allow Muslim pilgrimages to
Mecca, whereas the Soviet Union would
never consider allowing Muslims out
beyond its borders. This does not mean
that the Chinese are paragons of virtue,
but in the question of Chinese fanati-
cism and irrationality, and its extent in
this comparison with the Soviet Union,
we have a starting point for judgment:
we do know something about Soviet and
Chinese behaviour.
£JOME of the principles of Chinese
Communist dogma represent ex-
treme developments of Marxist dialec-
tical approach. On the other hand, we
in the West have our own contest of
good and evil principles, we have had
our own periods of peculiar prejudices.
I do believe that under Mao there
was a period of a more promising possi-
bility for effecting some sort of rap-
prochement or detente or understanding
the sort of words we used about the
Soviet Union in 1950 because I think
that Mao has basically a humanistic-
approach to these things. The cult of
Mao, which Professor Walker has
drawn attention to, is, I think, some-
thing quite distinct from Mao. I think
this is being used by the people who
hope to succeed Mao. I don’t think this
is directly related to Mao himself. This
opportunity to take advantage of what
may have been a more rational phase in
Chinese behaviour was missed, because
at the time people in the West were
saying the same things about China as
we are saying at the present tifrie
we may be more right nowadays
but the fact that we missed this oppor-
tunity makes it more important that
we take every opportunity to study
Chinese behaviour and analyse every
aspect of it.
Finally, Professor Walker mentioned
the question of the comparison between
the backward state of Chinese Commu-
nism and the developing revolution in
other Asian countries. I think he speaks
with most sincerity when he speaks
about Japan, because what is going
on in Japan is quite remarkable. Japan
is now entering the Jet Age. But why
is Japan able to do this? The Japan-
ese have for 100 years been able to
develop their own country, free from
external intervention, free from inter-
necine civil wars, and possibly one -of
the reasons why the Chinese are so
bitter and so hostile is because they
are too well aware of the way Japan
has been able to go ahead and, by


contrast, of the trouble that has been
inflicted and imposed upon China.
Professor D. M. Armstrong, Professor of
Philosophy, University of Sydney:
It seems to me that in practical poli-
tics one of the very important things
that one’s got to do is consider not only
what is the case but what is probably
the case and very often what might be
the case. One often adopts policies in
practical life not to prevent certainty,
not even to prevent probability, but to
prevent a possibility. I might give a
very simple illustration: one puts on
a safety belt in a car, not because it is
certain that one will have an accident,
not that it is even probable, but because
there is a possibility that one will have
an accident and one does not want to
get hurt. With this as background, I
would like to ask Mr. Clark does he
think that there is a possibility, a real
not a logical possibility, that the fright-
ening picture of China’s internal state
and China’s external ambitions that
Professor Walker has argued for is true?
Clark:
I think that the analogy about the
safety belt can be expanded. If you
knew that by putting on the safety
belt you were not always going to save
your life in an accident but that there
was an equal or a greater chance of
strangling yourself to death, you would
hesitate each time you put on
that safety belt. This is my point about
China, that the policies which have been
advocated on the basis of this alarmist
analysis (they may be realistic) are not
an insurance, but do in fact carry in
themselves grave risks of producing pre-
cisely that situation which we are
afraid is already in existence.
If the situation does not exist now,
and I certainly don’t think it was in
existence during the period that Mao
was in control of China, then we stand
to lose possibly more than we can gain.
Armstrong:
Then you think that there is a pos-
sibility that this situation is in existence.
What would you do about it if it was?
Clark:
Well, it would take quite a few hours
to formulate another policy toward
China. But Professor Walker has
already mentioned the policy of
greater exchanges, of greater trade, of
a greater attempt to communicate with
the Chinese leaders. Of course, if the
Chinese leaders are in a similar state
of mind to the Japanese and German
military leaders of the ’3os, then these
policies would not be effective, but if
they are not in this frame of mind we
stand to lose very little, apart from
the possible weakening of our own
morale, or our own determination to
resist, as some people put it. We
stand to gain a great deal in terms of
the breakdown of the isolationist aspect
—if this is in fact the key to Chinese
behaviour. In fact we stand to produce
the situation which has been produced
in the Soviet Union which is very
much, I think, as a result of the ex-
changes which took place in the 19505.
Owen Harries, Senior Lecturer in the
School of Political Science, University
of N.S.W.:
Professor Walker has stressed very
much the irrationality of the Chinese
regime, and this has been done in the
past in the case of Hitler and of Russia
under Stalin and Khrushchev. I have
argued against this in the past. It seems
to me that as far as means are con-
cerned, as far as the implementation
of policies are concerned, that there is
considerable .evidence of rationality,
that they don’t misunderstand the
West, that in a sense they understand
the West only too well and have been
extraordinary skilful in playing on the
weaknesses within the West in further-
ing their policies, and this in fact was
able to take them a very great distance.
If one sees the sorts of things Hitler was
saying about Britain in the early 1930 s
it was an assessment that had a great
deal of truth in it; it might have-fed
finally to a mistake, but it w;as the sort
of mistake that was based on substantial
evidence, not on fantasy. I think this
could be argued, too, in the case of
Russia, and I think it could be argued
. . . Just as Adolf Hitler and
his party later acted according
to the words of “Mein Kampf
the Chinese Communists do
intend to act according to their
own words ...
about China today. For example, the
Indonesian affair. Assuming Peking
complicity in the coup last year, was
this in fact irrational, did it fail by
such a large margin, could it not be
considered a perfectly rational risk to
have taken in terms of the gains accru-
ing if it came off, and according to
most people it was a pretty near thing?
My question to Mr. Clark is this.
He ran through a number of instances
where people on the other side looking
at the West might say: Well, the West
is doing the same sorts of things as
they say we are doing. He did not
declare his own position on this. I
would ask him in fact whether he
accepts this symmetry, whether he does
in fact think the situations are of the
same kind, or whether he thinks that
the people who say they are of the
same kind are mistaken. If they are
mistaken, does he think it worth show-
ing that they are mistaken and that the
sorts of things that the West are doing
and the sorts of things that are being
done on the other side are substantially
and in a very important way different?
Or does he really think that there is
symmetry?
Walker:
I certainly accept your point that
within the framework of its own
doctrine the Chinese Communist regime
has not only been generally cautious
but very rational. I would like to stress
the possibility of irrationality, the pos-
sibility, within their limited rationality,
driving them into a pattern which, from
the point of view of the rest of the
world, might be irrational. This is one
of the possibilities that we have noticed
in totalitarian regimes as they age.
Clark:
I just have a pessimistic - belief
about the inevitability of ungodly be-
haviour by the great powers, Communist
and non-Communist.
Dr. E. Bramsted, Reader in the Depart-
ment of History, University of Sydney:
I am no expert on China, but I have
given some thought to the totalitarian
systems of the West, and in particulai
Nazi Germany. It upsets me to hear
people talk of irrational behaviour only
in totalitarian States. I am in agree-
ment with Mr. Harries here. There is
a good deal of rationality. The late
Karl Mannheim once made a distinction
between functional and substantial
rationality in political systems. I think
that there is a great deal of functional
rationality in any totalitarian system.
If you think about how they organise
public opinion, or how they build up
their army, their police organisation,
it’s quite wrong to say that they are
irrational; this is a great deal of func-
tional rationality in the means to fur-
ther an end, and in a way this is much
more so than in the non-totalitarian
States which compete with them —take
England in the 19305. I would ask Pro-
fessor Walker how does he interpret the
period of the Hundred Flowers in 1957.
Would you say that it was just an acci-
dent which does not really fit into our
picture of China, or can we expect
another period of a Hundred or perhaps
a Thousand Flowers?
Walker:
The Hundred Flowers period fits into
the pattern that the regime has gone
through in connection with purges
before. The pattern of tension and re-
laxation helps to bring out clearly the
control of the regime and isolate those
wljo are vocally opposed to it. Chou
En-lai had said that there were 100,000
high-grade intellectuals (I don’t know
how he arrived at this figure), but back
in 1955 he said of these intellectuals
that 40 percent were with us, 40 per-
cent were against us, and 20 percent
were neutral, and then he announced
a Five Year Plan for bringing them
all into a framework of supporting the
regime. At the end of 1956 and the
beginning of 1957, when things had been
going well enough in the First Five

Year Plan, the regime made a basic
miscalculation; they thought they could
let off a bit of steam and do it safely.
This was necessary in the wake of de-
Stalinisation, and for one brief month,
from May 8 to June 8, 1957, it got
completely out of hand; they then
cracked down with a strong anti-
Rightist campaign and they lopped all
the weeds that had come up in Mao’s
flower garden.
Bramsted:
Do you think that any totalitarian
regime can long exist without allowing
from time to time a period of a Hun-
dred Flowers?
Walker:
I don’t know. Our experience with
totalitarian regimes is rather short, but
the history of the world is strewn with
long-enduring despotisms.
Dr. lan Wilson, Senior Lecturer in the
Department of Political Science, Aus-
tralian National University:
Your totalitarian model does not
seem to me to be a particularly use-
ful one. It leads us into pushing
analogies further than they should, par-
ticularly the Japanese one, and it
diverts our attention from the elements
of change in the Soviet Union so that
people were struck with great surprise
by the Khrushchev secret speech and
by subsequent developments. We should
be looking at the elements of change
in the Chinese system rather than the
elements which the totalitarian model
stresses those of stability. Would
it not be better to look at the group-
ings in Red China? (I am not arguing
that they are operating in a pluralistic
way at all.) Why not look at such
things as the Army, or Provincialism
(which I think is very strong)?
Walker:
I did not mean to underplay the
dynamics of totalitarian institutions.
There is change, indeed, but institutions,
as Karl Mannheim has pointed out,
have staying power. We tend to under-
estimate this staying power. In the
U.S.S.R. we in the West have been
far too sanguine about the so-called
great changes there they are still
executing people for selling apples
privately on the street, they are
still purging and exiling writers and
literary figures. This comes as a
shock if we have built up an image of
the great loosening-up. In China we
have been attempting to study the
various factors. Regionalism is very im-
portant (Mao nominated a fellow pro-
vincial to be his heir apparent; now
another, who is not, seems to be the
likely successor). There have been a
great many studies of the problems
within the elite, and of attitudes in and
to the armed forces. We should devote
attention to these. I don’t want to
present an unchanging model, but it is
nevertheless a meaningful model.
W. H. C. Eddy, Senior Staff Tutor,
Department of Tutorial Studies, Uni-
versity of Sydney:
What is the position of Mao <in re-
lation to the regime?
Walker:
I suspect that Mao is approaching
senility and that although he may be
having occasional bursts of rationality
he is round the bend. But I don’t think
anyone knows, really. It is a guessing
game, but there are enough indications
that he may be suffering from the
hardening of the arteries of the brain
which would give him moments of
lucidity and moments of haziness. What
is being done now is being done in his
name. For the 30 years when he was in
full control, there were no meaningful
purges of the Long Marchers. Now the
first big cleavage has come and a great
number of the Marchers are now appar-
ently out.
Clark:
I think that Mao has been out
of action for some time. He is there
and available to meet conferences
and delegations, but in fact the
affairs of State have been run by the
apparatus, the tightly knit Party group.
The intellectuals who were close to
Mao were, as long as a Mao was in
control, safe to write their little
parodies, etc. Now that Mao can no
longer protect them, the apparatchiks
are free to use the cult of Mao to act
against them.

He took another gulp of coke and
lemon, moaned softly from exhaustion,
and admitted:, ‘ I changed about six

Just diets. And I found I didn’t need

him on the second night of his three

some e a d sept for 22 hours
after the flight from Los Angeles, but
a opene s oit y after with two
shows an appearance with Don Lane
on te evision, and a stretch of Press
interviews. Even for a funny man like
Sherman, that isn t funny.
Sherman’s parodies of popular songs
are in the nonsense tradition of Ogden
Nash. Thus “What kind of a fool Am
I becomes “One hippopotami” and
his contribution to the study of British
Foreign Policy in the latter half of the
nineteenth century is hilariously built
up to a bouncing Won’t you come

satirist of modern American suburbia,
but his humor here is not as sharp as
Shelley Bermans’.
He becomes special when he is a
comedian of the absurd and, in parti-
cular, a comedian of the human body.
For what could be more absurd than
that? Sherman’s concern (a minor
obsession really) with the body and
all its wonderfully comic parts starts
with the Sherman body itself. There
is something immediately funny about
him singing a Barbra Streisand song
(“People . . . People who eat garlic,
Are the smelliest people in the
world”).
Or Deborah Kerr (“Hello, Young
Lovers . . . You’re under arrest”).
Often the parts of the body take on
their own character and an independent
existence. (“Have you ever thought
what would happen if you had ten belly
buttons? It would be easier to learn
touch-typing.”) He sings about teeth
to the strains of “The Continental”
(“Beautiful Molars, Lovely Bicuspids”);
he ponders on why so many love songs
have been written about the heart
(“You are always in my colon,’.’ “Deep
in my pancreas”); toes and intestines
have a life of their own. It is easy to
see Sherman standing in front of the
mirror each morning after a shower
and exploding with mirth.
In the three-and-a-half years since
he recorded his first record, he has
had his “Hello Muddah, Hello Fuddah”
in hit parades all over the world, he
has recorded eight LPs, among them
a Sherman version of “Peter and the
Wolf” with him conducting the Boston
Philharmonic, and toured successfully
in South Africa, Britain, and Germany.
The BBC has recorded six TV specials
which may be shown in Australia. As
well, he has written two books —an
autobiography and a guide to “Instant
Status” —satirical stories for “Playboy,”
and the hundreds of his own songs.

AT A TIME when the world is cele-
brating (if that is the right word)

get on around here.”
debacle, it will be of some interest for
Australians to meet the Director of
the Overseas Development Institute in
London, Mr. William Clark. Clark
was at the time of Suez public relations
adviser to the then British Prime Min-
ister, Anthony Eden.
In fact, Clark, like so many other
Englishmen of all political shades of
opinion, went through torments over
Suez, handed in his resignation to Eden
in the middle of the crisis, and had it
accepted soon after the fighting in
Egypt stopped.
He then went back to the London
“Observer” to his old job of diplomatic
correspondent. And he started work on
a novel, to be published next month
and called “Number Ten.” (The Ameri-
can edition will add the words “Down-
ing Street,” just to make it perfectly
clear.) “It is strictly a novel,” Clark
says. “And it’s not about the Suez
crisis. It’s a history of a British crisis
and how it works.”
Clark has accepted an invitation of
the Australian Planning Institute to
address their Congress IX 66 at
Menzies Hotel, Sydney, on August 22.
He will talk about relationships between
Britain, Australia, and South-East Asia,
with special reference to the develop-
ment of the have-not countries, which
he knows well as a result of his present
job.
The Overseas Development Institute
was started only in 1960 with the help
of a grant from the Ford Foundation.
Clark became its first director.
Close followers of Australian news-
paper politics will be aware that at one
stage it was thought that William Clark
might take up the editorship of the
“Sydney Morning Herald.” He is
known to have been offered the job on
more than one occasion in the days
before Angus Maude fell for the bait.
Is it possible that Mr. Rupert Hender-
son was determined to have someone
with strong views about Suez?

Zubi Baby
FRIENDS of the Israel Philharmonic
Orchestra, who have made such a long,
sustained effort to raise money to get
the orchestra to this country, should
get their money’s worth in spectacular
conducting and sheer force of per-
sonality from Zubin Mehta.
And Aunty ABC, which is directing
the tour, may find that Mehta, who.
with the noted Antal Dorati, is the
principal conductor for the tour, is
somewhat more exuberant than their
usual choice of visitor.
Mehta is permanent conductor of
both the Los Angeles Philharmonic and
the Montreal Symphony orchestras. He
is just 30. When he conducted “Aida”
at the Metropolitan opera house earlier
this year, he said afterwards, “I’m glad
I made it to the Met. before I was
30.”
Born in Bombay, Mehta is the first
Indian to win world renown as a con-
ductor of Western music. He made his
first bid for big success in 1961 when a
large number of ranking conductors
fell sick or were for other reasons un-
able to carry out their engagements.
Mehta rushed from continent to con-
tinent, filling the breach. “I some-
times think my success was due almost
entirely to the misfortunes of my
elderly colleagues,” he said afterwards.
Sometimes Mehta has been received
by critics with something less than
enthusiasm. After he conducted at
Salzburg and received severe notices
he said: “Intellectual snobs forget that
showmanship is a great asset to the pro-
fession.”
However, it has been on the West
Coast of America, the home of modern
showmanship, that Mehta has come into
his own. There the San Francisco con-
ductor Josef Krips declared of him:
“The next Toscanini has been born.”
There, too, the $33,500,000 Los
Angeles Music Pavilion is a dazzling
shrine to his talents. The pavilion, an
elaborately decorated building designed
by Hal Pereira, chief art director for
Paramount studios, was opened two
years ago. Much of the fund-raising
was done by Mrs. Dorothy Chandler,
wife of the president of the Los Angeles
newspaper group, Times-Mirror. Much
of the money was raised by inducing
local people to place a dollar into
“buck bags,” specially designed by Walt
Disney.
In the past two years with Mehta,
known locally as “Zubi baby” or “Sabu,”
as conductor subscription tickets have
more than doubled on the preceding
year. “Without Zubin Mehta,” said a
prominent Los Angeles woman, “the
new Music Pavilion would be just
another building.”
But although Mehta is perfectly at
home in this flamboyant setting, there
is little doubt that he intends to make
a job of his orchestra. “I want to
develop with my orchestra,” he said. “It
took Ormandy 25 years to build the
Philadelphia. I want to do that with
the Philharmonic.”

ROUND MELBOURNE
A Beautiful Blending of Blues
LAST week it was male cos-
metics. Well, it continues to
be Scrumptious Male Month
in Melbourne. Myers, of all people,
has gone crazy for Carnaby Street
and is in the process of opening a
“gear store.” They will have the
finest in sartorial elegance like floral
braces, pale blue denim suits,
double breasted jackets that double
breast all the way up to the adam’s
apple, circa 1910 railway caps, and,
of course, an utterly gorgeous array
of boots in the softest of leathers.
The grand opening of all this
value and friendly service will be
to the noise of swingin’ groups and
stomping of go-go girls. We live
in a new age when an overseas buyer
is too old at 19.
Ah, but in a great fight back last
week we had the launching of the
“Fashion Express.” This is a rail-
way train that is travelling through
the four eastern states from Mel-
bourne to Adelaide to Brisbane to
Sydney to spread the message on
“the key points of conservative good
dressing.” No individual trade
names are mentioned, but the cost
to the Men’s Fashion Council is
$21,000.
Your correspondent hurried to
Spencer Street on Sunday to fare-
well the train. He was' met by the
director of the Men’s Fashion Coun-
cil, Mr. Stanley Hughes, who was
beautifully conservatively dressed in
a grey suit with very fine herring-
bone pattern, burgundy-and-gold
Paisley tie, the color of which was
attractively reproduced in the bur-
gundy in his socks, and the matching
burgundy-and-gold Paisley handker-
chief in his fob pocket. For a mo-
ment there was a fear all round
that he had made a mistake with
his cuff-links but the gold in the
links did complement the gold in the
tie. ]
He introduced us to Bob Martin,
the male model who was travelling
with the train. Bob was wearing a
pale blue shirt, dark blue suit, and
there was a blending of blues all
through to the narrow-brimmed
Tyrolean blue hat. Lo, he dis-
appeared and returned in a grey
suit, pink shirt, wine tie with white
polka dots, wine hankie with white
polka dots, and wine cuff-links.
Stan explained this was the mes-
sage he was trying to put over. Get
all your accessories matching. He
said: “A man should think for five
minutes before going to bed what
he is going to wear the next day
and plan it. If he has a good assort-
ment of well-chosen accessories he
could give variety to his dress. He
could wear the same suit two days
running and nobody would notice.”
A reporter gave a somewhat rude
aside: “Geez, my chief of staff would
burst into tears if I wore the same
suit two days running.” Your cor-
respondent was feeling a little un-
comfortable, no cuff-links, only
crude plastic buttons, no matching
hankie in his fob pocket, although
he was wearing socks.
There was the timid question:
“How many cuff-links should a
gentleman possess?” Said Stan: “If
you have two suits then you should
have two sets of cuff-links and so
on. You should also have cuff-links
for your sports coat. Your casual
cuff-links should be bigger, chunkier,
more rugged.”
He said, too, that it was a very
good idea for a businessman to keep
spare ties in his drawer at the office.
Often he would be caught at the
office, unable to get home, before he
went off to a cocktail party, there-
fore it was wise to have a tie ready
to reflect his newer, gayer mood.
Why, said Stan, he knew one
executive who kept a bunch of ties
for different interviews. If he were
interviewing a young man he would
put on a dashing young man’s tie.
If he were interviewing an older
man, then he would put on a conser-
vative tie of very good taste.
However, it was time to inspect
the Fashion Express. The first car-
riage was the Norman car, normally
reserved for the Victorian Railways
Commissioners. This was air-condi-
tioned and equipped with a bar.
Next came two vintage carriages
that had been fitted with wall-to-wall
carpet, imitation leather on the walls
for a rugged masculine look, pots
“No! No! Gentlemen you’re
not wearing the right thing
at all...!”
of indoor plants here and there, a
general atmosphere of good mascu-
line breeding like Simpson’s or
Aquascutum’s. There was piped
music, a dozen or so dummy models,
and, here and there for that essen-
tially male touch, a box of Henri
Winterman cigars or a small keg of
Cobb and Co. eau de Cologne.
Here and there were messages on
the wall in a nice scroll: “Man’s
clothes are far more than skin deep.
They exert subtle influence on his
self-confidence, his behaviour, his.
moods . . .”
Stan led the party through. “We
have rostered someone every day to
water the indoor plants,” he said.
The dummy models were boyish
with their hair brushed straight for-
ward, but their accessories matched
magnificently.
Stan told us the London Look
was the thing this year form-
fitting clothes, pulled in at the waist,
wider lapels, deep side vents and
shoes that were neither pointed nor
actually square-toed. “The shoes,”
he said, “should look like the nose
of a Citroen.”
Here, many of us who had been
wearing the same shoes for the past
eight years, had our moment of
triumph. Our shoes were high'-
fashion again; indeed, quite like
noses of Citroens. Next Stan showed
us sports clothes. He said for casual
wear one should never overdo it,
never clash checks with stripes.
Always go for a feature garment,
say, a brilliant check shirt . . . but
then mate it with a pair of plain
conservative trousers. “After all,” he
said, “if you have a prima donna
on the stage you don’t try to drown
her with a jazz band in the wings.”
We learnt several more important
things, that chalk stripes and plain
stripes were decidedly in for shirts
and the Paisley patterns were all the
rage for ties, handkerchiefs, and
sports shirts. “It’s all come about
because young people have dis-
covered Paisley.”
Mr. Rylah, as acting Premier, was
due to despatch the train at 9 p.m.,
travelling as honorary guard to
North Melbourne. He was to be
presented with a box of ties, a
guard’s hat, and a specially inscribed
whistle. The box of 12 ties, no
doubt, had a complete range to re-
flect all his moods with special colors
for election speeches and for meet-
ings of the Loan Council.
As we walked away from No. 3
platform Spencer St., we noticed
that the train was adorned with the
Fashion Council symbol, a fig leaf;
a somewhat dangerous symbol for
mid-winter.

Only Against The Clock?
Our Enigmatic Man in Jamaica
Ron Clarke’s second defeat, as Kip Keino passes him in the three-mile event.
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
“ you feel that there
is not another breath left in your
lungs or another beat in your
heart. You’re hot and tired and your
legs are soft as clay. But somehow
you keep running, counting the laps if
you can, and hoping it will all be over
soon. Near the end, you realise the
record can be yours, and the relief
that it’s nearly over now allows you to
forget the pain and make another
surge. You sprint for the line, and wait
for the time, and you feel good that
your mind can get so much out of
your body. When you recover you
might do some more laps just for the
sheer joy of running.”
So Ron Clarke described how he felt
in the long races during his conquer-
ing European tour last year. In 15
races in 49 days he broke 12 world
records for distances from three miles
to 10,000 metres. Publicists and com-
mentators on athletics flipped from
cliche to Thesaurus searching for words
to describe his performances.
The “News of the World” said:
“Clarke ran like a faultless piece of
machinery. Think of Nurmi, Zatopek,
or any other all-time great and you can
put Clarke at the top.” The “Sunday
Times” described his running eight
seconds off the world three-mile record
on a soggy White City track as “fan-
tastic”: “No one has ever given such
a superb display of perfect running
as Clarke did this afternoon.”
A couple of days later, when he
became the first man to break 28 min-
utes for 10,000 metres, the London
“Mirror” called him “The Iron Man
of Athletics,” declaring: “Ron Clarke
set the seal on his right to be rated
the greatest runner of all time,” The
learned arbiter of matters sporting, the
American “Sports Illustrated,” ex-
plained the series of “sensational” rec-
ords: “He has established an entirely
new school of philosophy about distance
running.” Ron Clarke returned home
to a civic reception and a lap of honor
of the Melbourne Cricket Ground, and
the launching of a $50,000 appeal to
commemorate his performances and to
set up a fund for sending Australian
athletes overseas.
Twelve months later, two defeats by
Kenyans in times well outside his own
records, and Clarke ruefully comments
that he has more silver than Father
Christmas. Two Commonwealth Games
and one Olympic, but no gold medals
for the man so recently acclaimed as
the greatest ever. What has happened
to Ron Clarke? The world’s Press is
quick to offer an answer, but not the
same answer. One writer says Clarke
lacks killer instinct, another that he is
a clock runner, a third hints that he
lacks the courage to fight out a tough
finish, yet another explains that he
lacks natural pace for the finishing
sprint.
*pHE “bitching brigade” of London’s
sporting pages have reserved for
Clarke some of the scorn which they
normally save for the failures of their
own national heroes; and Australia, it
seems, has sadly shaken its head in
acknowledgement that its own record-
slaying Achilles can be brought to heel
in tough competition races when times
are irrelevant and only victory counts.
The charge of failure of courage is
unconvincing. A man who has at some
time during the past two years beaten
all of the world’s best distance runners,
and who has not just set new world
times but has sliced multiple seconds
(each second being worth up to seven
or eight yards) from previous records,
surely has the heart of a lion. Measured
against the same facts, the explana-
tion that he lacks killer instinct does
not carry .much more weight. The
answer to the Clarke enigma may be
found in the history of his athletic
performances.
Early in 1956, he strode to world
fame as a boy of 18 when he began
breaking national and world junior
records over distances from 880 yards
to 3000 metres. His reward was to
carry the Olympic torch into the Mel-
bourne Cricket- Ground, turned
Stadium, to light the Olympic flame.
But National Service, sinus, and
bronchial infections set in, and his
name slowly disappeared from the
record books. The name Clarke be-
came for the next six years firmly
associated with Ron’s brother Jack, a
champion Victorian League footballer,
who won all-Australian blazers, cap-
tained Essendon in a premiership, and
is now a prominent architect.
In 1961 Ron emerged again as a can-
didate for the three miles at the Perth
Empire Games. He had given up mixed
pace training on the track and taken to
running long distances through suburbs
and parks without concern for the stop-
watches which control track training.
The result was a surprising second at
the Empire Games to world three-mile
record-holder Murray Halberg. He
knew then that his steady running of
long distances combined with some
gymnasium work had been successful,
and set his sights on the gold medals
of Tokyo. A year later the many hours
of steady training and the innumerable

Why can Orlando make
Blue Ribbon Spaetlese
Riesling every year ?
In Europe, where climatic variations can be substantial, it is
not possible. But in South Australia's Sunny Barossa Valley,
where the weather is stable, Orlando so far has been able to
produce a true Spaetlese every year since it was the first "late
picking” Riesling to be produced in Australia in 1956.
Blue Ribbon Spaetlese is a unique white wine that is vintaged
only from the last and ripest Rhine Riesling grapes picked in
each Vintage Year. Its superb fruity freshness makes it the
perfect wine to enjoy with all sweeter foods, particularly
desserts.
Your first sip of this bottle-aged wine will tell you why it has
been awarded a Gold Medal overseas every year it has been
shown.

miles in his legs brought back the head-
lines he had not known since he was 19.
At 26 he broke the world six miles and
10,000 metres records before 23 spec-
tators at Melbourne’s Olympic Park. He
raced on his own for most of the race,
lapping most of the others. He began
setting new national records over
various distances, his long, easy stride
soon distancing the rest of his Aus-
tralian competition. With victory
assured, the only strong drive he had
was to break records. Race tactics were
unnecessary.
Tokyo and the 10,000 metres brought
disappointment and the first serious
doubts about his ability as a competitor.
The favorite for the event, and Aus-
tralia’s best-known athlete, he led as
usual almost from the start and was still
leading as they ran into the final lap.
“I thought I had it won,” he said. “I
won’t say I slackened, but at the same
time I was not as cautious as I might
have been had I been worried.” Just
as he felt confident of victory, having
beaten off his supposed leading rivals,
Halberg, Lindgren, Bolotnivok, and
Kidd, he was challenged and passed by
Mahomed Gamoudi, am outsider from
Tunisia. He won the lead again into
the last bend, only to be passed first by
U.S. Marine Billy Mills, who had saved
himself for one fast final sprint, and
then by Gamoudi in the last few yards.
“The three chaps with me were com-
plete strangers—l thought I would be
able to shake them off easily. I said to
myself, ‘l’ve got it won’ —that was my
mistake.”
WITH the bronze medal came a new
determination to fracture all exist-
ing records and win the gold of the
Jamaica Games. He realised that
through lack of running against strong
competition and sheer ebullient desire
to run races at maximum speed, he had
provided the rest of the Olympic field
with a pacemaker, a target, and wha* is
known in running as a “sit.” As such he
was always in danger from strong, cour-
ageous runners who could save them-
selves mentally and physically for a last
final sprint.
In the next year followed the
greatest series of record-breaking per-
formances in the history of athletics. In
Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the
United States, England, France, and
Norway he broke records, national and
world, over distances of 3000 metres,
three miles, 5000 metres, six miles,
10,000 metres, and ten miles. But he
was also beaten in some races, some-
times because he was tired and other
times because he struck fit, tough
athletes whom he could not burn off
and who “sat” behind his lead waiting
for one last effort when Clarke’s tactic
of leading at a fast pace had robbed
him of mental and physical reserves.
He was beaten by the Frenchman
Jazy, recent Commonwealth Games
gold-medallist Keino, and New Zealand
Olympic-miler Davies in the same
period as he sm&shed the previously
impenetrable “barriers” of 13 minutes
for three miles, 27 minutes for six miles,

28 minutes for 10,000 metres. As a
consequence it was said that Clark<s
was a ‘record-breaker when allowed to
run along at his own pace, but not a
race-winner. But while he did lose to
world-class runners in some races, he
defeated them in others and proved
that under the right conditions he could
sprint with and past the best. Given
the chance to run behind Keino’s pace-
making, he was able to sprint past the
Kenyan without trouble; the day after
he came from behind his Olympic con-
queror, Billy Mills, and beat him by 10
yards in the final straight. Clarke felt
that he had the answer to the some-
time problem of his race efforts not
matching his records.
JJOWEVER, he has found it difficult
to run from behind in subsequent
races. He believes, with John Landy,
that the race is the whole distance and
that loafing until the final sprint, or de-
liberately sitting on a pacemaker, is not
in the true spirit of athletics. His con-
sistent tendency to run to the front
and try to blast off his opponents with
relentless pace may also be due to a
fear established in him by defeat in the
Tokyo 10,000 metres. The experience
of seeing certain victory sweep past
him in the last bend seems to have left
its impression: a fear that he cannot
depend on his final burst of speed and
a consequent need to keep the pressure
on his opponents the whole way in the
hope that their condition or spirit will
break. Mostly they do, but not so much
in races which are the target of years
of hard training and ambition: Olympic
and Commonwealth Games events
especially in those events an incor-
rigible will working through bodily
strength and fitness gives an athlete
following the pace a great chance of
developing a final burst which the pace-
maker may not be able to match. It is
a situation well known in other sports,
especially cycling.
Clarke’s biggest handicap may be
simply the result of running for a long
time in Australia without meeting
strong competition. Without/opponents
to match him he has disregarded race
tactics and worrying about winning,
and spurred himself by trying to break
records. He adopted a style of running
too inflexible for crowded and world-
class fields, and when Clarke works
hard in front to break up a champion-
ship race he takes more out of himself
than out of his opponents. A runner who
can stay within striking distance has
not used so much power and may be
able to pass Clarke in the final stages.
In the hot, humid climate of Jamaica
the Clarke style of front running proved
even more unfortunate in tough com-
petition with the challenge from Kenya.
Clarke’s awareness of the difficulty
of becoming a champion distance run-
ner in Australia has led him to work
hard in amateur athletic circles for
a campaign to send our best athletes on
overseas tours regularly. He points out
that these tours are invaluable both as
an incentive and for the competitive
experience gained. The example of
cricket and football is a strong argu-
ment for his case.
Now that he has failed for the third
time to win the Games gold medal and
prove himself a champion race rummer,
the bitterly disappointed Clarke must
decide whether to ease himself out- of
athletics gracefully, or choose another
two years of discipline and strain in
order to prepare himself for one final
challenge at the 1968 Olympics. The
dedication to training is sometimes
exaggerated by commentators. In full
training he works out for about two
and a half hours a day, usually morn-
ings, lunch-time, and after work. But
if work (he is an accountant) or social
engagements intervene he varies the
program. He also points out that his
average training time is not much
more than some men spend in hotels
or even on the golf course. He claims
to work about 50 hours a week at his
job and to conduct normal family and
social lives. But at 29 he knows that
the training will not get easier and the
competition at Mexico will not be any
weaker than at Jamaica or Tokyo.
The urge to break records is not
strong now, but the desire to prove to
himself and the world that he can
equal his records with race perform-
ances burns inside him. If he feels that
he can get enough time in Mexico be-
fore the Games to become acclimatised
to the height, the lure of the gold medal
may draw another two years of running
out of him.
The irony of Clarke’s situation is that
he has consistently announced his love
for running, whether training or racing:
as he said to THE BULLETIN last
year, “Basically, I don’t run to prove
anything to myself or the world, but
because I enjoy it.” His enthusiasm has
been so evident that it even brought
England’s Chris Brasher to say that
apart from his claim to be the greatest
distance runner in history, Clarke would
be forever worthy of Mount Olympus
because “he had brought enjoyment
back to athletics.”
Enjoyment certainly has been one
notable aspect of Ron Clarke’s per-
formances, up to but not including his
failure after 19 of the 26 miles in the
marathon at Jamaica a distance for
which he is not well equipped and in
which his entry may well have been
a desperate “last chance” to win a gold
medal. There is no enjoyment in a
marathon, let alone in another failure.
His Olympic and Commonwealth
failures, and the comment they have
provoked, have replaced enjoyment and
ebullience with irritation and doubt.
If Clarke retires now he retires as a
champion against the clock but not
against other champion runners. The
desire to prove himself a race champion
is now his strongest motive for running
on. It may prove powerful enough to
take him to Mexico.

Be in It to Fail to Win It
ONE would
hardly expect
that the
people who run
lotteries in N.S.W.
would feel it neces-
sary to drum up
business. Such an
effort is rather like
urging the popu-
lace to take more
interest in sex. It
is preaching, to the
converted. However, it is being done,
and to encourage us to buy tickets we
are introduced to lucky persons who
have carried off prizes. “Meet ecstatic
Marion Evans, lottery winner,” begins
a typical exhortation.
Marion looks quite a nice woman,
and I for one do not begrudge her her
good fortune. At the same time I can-
not help thinking of all the ticket-
buyers who read the result of that
particular lottery without ecstasy. A
cynical person once expressed the
opinion that history is the propaganda
of the victors it does not tell you
how the losers felt. Much the same
criticism might be directed at the
methods of promoting lotteries.
One of the experiences that con-
tributes most frequently to the great
sum of human fed-upness is reading
lottery results. The first sick wave hits
you as you go through the major prizes
at the top. By the time you are down to
the tenners I can’t think of lottery
prizes in decimal currency the gloom
is deeper. With the reading of the
fivers, as Verlaine said after a lottery-
drawing, hope has fled defeated towards
the black sky.
Certain favored individuals are able
to derive a perverse satisfaction from
nearly winning a prize. I knew a barber
who never tired of telling his customers
how he came two off the first prize in
the Golden Casket in 1947. It was the
supreme moment of his life. Yet to
many, nearly winning is even more
painful than being miles off. If only
one had got to the ticket window a
moment earlier or later, as the case
may be.
Some years ago a book was written
about the early days of Hitler by a
man who had known him in Vienna in
his youth. The author recalled that
Hitler was a keen purchaser of lottery
tickets, and often talked of the things
he would do if he won. The future
Fuehrer’s dreams were surprisingly in-
nocuous his main ambition was to
buy new furniture for his flat. Then,
when the results came out, he would
fly into a rage. His ex-friend believed
that the bitterness which drove Hitler
to his political career was due in no
small to his failure to win the
lottery.
My guess is that he came one or
two off a big prize; that could well
have been the last straw that turned
him into a maniac. The history of the
world might have been less unpleasant
if he had had better luck. The
appropriate authorities in Vienna could
have put out a notice: “Meet ecstatic
Adolf Hitler, lottery winner. Adolf is
smiling happily because his dream of
getting new furniture has come true.”
While few lottery losers are as dis-
turbed mentally as Hitler, they do
harbor resentment and a feeling of
being unwanted. The lottery organisers
carefully ignore them, even trying to
create an impression that they do not
exist. When a lottery is drawn, news-
paper reporters never rush out by car
to interview those who have failed to
win a prize.
In an attempt to reveal the other
side of the picture, I went to see one
of the unsuccessful ticket-holders in the
last Sydney Opera House Lottery. He
is Mr. Cec Dillwood (“My Turn”), of
143 Station Street, Cammeray.
When I arrived Mr. Dillwood was
digging in his garden; he had a glum,
preoccupied expression.
“How does it feel to be a non-
prizewinner in the Opera House
Lottery?” I asked him.
“Lousy,” he replied.
“Can you tell me some of the things
you will not be doing as a result of
your unsuccess?”
“Well, for a start, the wife and I
won’t be going for a trip round the
world. And we won’t buy a house for
our married daughter.”
“Was there some kind of hunch that
led you to buy the losing ticket?”
“No. I just got it as usual from Mrs.
Johnson’s Lucky Kiosk . . .”
Perhaps, as a result of the case I
have argued here, the lottery people
will come around to bestowing some
attention on their less ecstatic customers.
If so, I am willing to let my name be
used in publicity material. I suggest
something on these lines: “Meet de-
pressed Ross Campbell, lottery loser.
Only a week ago Mr. Campbell thought
he was very unlikely to become the
proud owner of a brand new Mercedes-
Benz 250. It turned out that he was
right.”

NEW YORK LETTER
17,000 Gun Deaths
The High Cost of Right to Bear Arms
Those of us
who live by,
and for, the
printed word have
been greatly heart-
ened in recent
months by a spate
of crusading
“muck - raking” is
the old-fashioned
word—books, which
have had such tre-
mendous impact
and stirred this country and its legisla-
tors that they have led to long-needed
remedial legislation. Marshall McLuhan
and his electronic-age theories not-
withstanding, the written message is
still the medium; the TV-nurtured,
ear-minded generation may be on its
way, but the eye-minded readers still
hold the seats of power.
First—and still foremost, in my
opinion—was the magnificently re-
searched and beautifully written “Silent
Spring,” by the late Rachel Carson,
which took the lid off America’s stink-
ing rivers and lakes, befouled by com-
mercial and human wastes, and exposed
the growing air pollution which
threatens to choke the nation. As a
result of the controversy stirred up by
“Silent Spring,” the Senate of the
United States has just passed, unani-
mously, a Water Pollution Control Bill
which will cost the taxpayers
U. 5.56400 thousand million, and a com-
panion Air Pollution Control Bill will
cost them $196 million more.
*J»HEN came Jessica Mitford’s “The
American Way of Death,” a bril-
liant, witty expose of the funeral racket
which was victimising Americans, par-
ticularly the poorer ones, by cruel
exploitation of human grief. Many
States have now enacted legislation to
curb the shabbier morticians’ practices
and prices and to force them to reveal
the real costs of embalming, coffins, and
funeral limousines in advance to pros-
pective customers.
Ralph Nader, in his hard-hitting
book, “Unsafe at Any Speed,” instigated
a major Congressional investigation into
Detroit’s failure to incorporate elemen-
tary safety features in its high-priced
motor-cars. 'As a direct result of the
ensuing revelations in Congress, the
American motor-car industry has now
been forced to modify its traditional
emphasis on styling and speed and to
provide its customers with cars more
nearly fit for human conveyance.
To this illustrious list you can cer-
tainly add “The Right to Bear Arms,”
by Carl Bakal, a searching inquiry into
the mystique of the gun in American
life, and a persuasive plea for some
form of legal restraint on the virtually
uncontrolled traffic in handguns, rifles,
shotguns, bazookas, and even larger
weapons in the United States. “The
Right to Bear Arms” appeared during
the week in which Charles Whitman
horrified the nation by climbing atop
a tower on the campus of the Univer-
sity of Texas and using his personal
arsenal of guns to drill holes in half a
hundred of his fellow citizens peacefully
strolling below.
Judging by the vast amount of
exposure the book has since received
in every communications medium, there
seems little doubt that it will prove
to be the vital factor in forcing a re-
luctant Congress to enact so-called
“anti-gun” legislation which it has been
procrastinating ever since the assassina-
tion of John F. Kennedy. A,mong other
things it did to the citizens of America,
the senseless killing of the President
shocked them into the belated realisa-
tion that something had to be done
about the instant availability of lethal
weapons to anyone with the purchase
price. (In this age of easy credit you
don’t even need that; Whitman acquired
one of the shotguns he lugged to his
tower on hire purchase a few hours
before in an Austin department store.)
This is a violent country, which has
seen four of its chief executives slain
by pistol and rifle fire in the past
century. The statistics on wounds and
deaths by gunfire are appalling. Since
the turn of the century 750,000 Ameri-
can civilians have died of bullet wounds
—as compared with the total of
530,000 Americans who have died in
uniform in all the country’s wars from
the Revolution of 1776 through the cur-
rent hostilities in Vietnam.
Americans shoot each other in their
homes, in saloons, in streets, in cars,
in jet aircraft by day and by night,
drunk and sober (but mostly drunk)
at the rate of fifty a day, or 17,000 a
year. Even in a population of 190
million, that adds up to a noticeable
number of corpses.
Many voices have been raised in the
halls of Congress, speaking out against
this great plague of gun murders. One
such voice, ironically, was that of
Senator John F. Kennedy, who intro-
duced a Bill in 1958 which would have,
if enacted, barred from the United
States the very gun which was to kill
him five years later. Senator Kennedy’s
Bill sought to stem the tide of military
pistols and rifles flowing into this
country after World War II from
Italy, Germany, and other former
belligerents. Kennedy’s special target
was the cheap gun being imported in
greatest number the 6.5 mm. Mann-
licher-Carcano carbine from Italy. Lee
Harvey Oswald was able to acquire one

we came across this snapshot of Brambles first crane.
In its day it was big news and a modern piece of

Brambles Company was born.
The Newcastle crane is in dramatic-

—quite a brood of offspring for that
one little crane in Newcastle which
began it all.

Following closely the opening of CHEP Hirings at
Melbourne (as reported in the June issue of Brambles
News), CHEP has been awarded the sole Towmotor
franchise for Victoria. CHEP Sales and Service com-
menced operations at the new premises at Sudholz
Street, West Melbourne, on 1st July, 1966.
CHEP Sales and Service are now the sole distributor
for Towmotor fork lift trucks and Gerlinger material
carriers in the States of New South Wales and Victoria.
The Towmotor and Gerlinger equipment provides a
full range from 2,500 lb. to 60,000 lb. capacity.
Mr. Frank Murphy has been appointed Melbourne
Manager, CHEP Sales and Service, which is part of
the Victorian Branch of CHEP managed by Mr. John
Walker. Mr. Murphy has been associated with sales
of Towmotor and Gerlinger units in Victoria for the
last four years and has been joined by other experi-

of these through the mail for thirteen
dollars from a Chicago dealer because
Congress took no action on the Ken-
nedy Bill.
The principal reason for Congress-
sional failure to erase this “stain of
violence” from America’s countenance
is the existence of a large, vigilant, and
well-financed lobby in Washington,
dedicated to the cause of killing all
legislation, no matter how mild or ten-
tative, designed to delimit the existing
open market in gun traffic. This lobby
operates in the guise of the National
Rifle Association, which author Bakal
describes as “one of the country’s most
powerful yet least-known lobbies, head-
quartered within gunshot of the
White House in a gleaming glass-
and-marble, three-and-a-half-million-
dollar structure with a rifle and pistol
range in the basement.
“PURPORTING to speak for the
nation’s estimated 30 million gun-
owners, the 700,000-member organisa-
tion has opposed and managed to
scuttle virtually any legislation seeking
to impose sensible controls on the avail-
bility, sale, and use of firearms in the
United States. In the view of the NRA,
‘almost all gun laws are bad laws.’ ”
When the Second Amendment was
written into the Constitution, the
American citizen had a sensible reason
for possessing a rifle or shotgun. But
whether the “right to bear arms” is
literally meaningful or even legal in
modern society has been challenged by
many constitutional experts, Bakal
points out. In any case, the NRA’s
further claim that a “potential
aggressor” or foreign invader must
-quake at the “knowledge of thirty
million Americans who own and know
how to use firearms” is rather ridicu-
lous in the age of nuclear overkill.
As customary, following a major gun
tragedy, a spokesman for the NRA,
executive secretary Franklin Orth,
rushed into print with the statement
that gun-control laws could not have
prevented the Austin .massacre or the
mass slaying of eight Chicago nurses
a fortnight earlier, since both deeds
were the work of madmen.
The specific legislation Orth had in
mind was the so-called Dodd Bill, in-
troduced in Congress shortly after
Kennedy’s death, but never brought to
a vote of either House. This Bill, which
would seek to ban interstate mail order
sales of guns (such as the Oswald pur-
chase) and to seek through affidavit
to prohibit interstate sales to convicts
and other is a compara-
tively mild form of anti-gun legislation.
It does not go as far as many would
like for example, requiring registra-
tion of all guns, as motor-cars are
registered. President Johnson called for
passage of the Dodd Bill a few days
after the Austin massacre. The NRA
has taken its familiar posture of un-
conditional opposition. But this time,
with public opinion aroused by the
Bakal book, the NRA looks like a loser,
and the public, at large, a winner.

A Fulltime Ex-Champion
Meet Rocky Marciano , Sponsor of Boxers
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
THAT nonpareil of all boxing
writers, A. J. Liebling, recorded
that the crafty little trainer
Charlie Goldman once told him that
he had a pupil in “an improving phase
he’s still six months maybe a
year away the great thing about
this kid is he’s got leverage. He takes
a good punch and he’s got the
equaliser.” Goldman meant that
Marciano had the ability to equalise,
that is cancel out with one or two
punches the points advantage which a
more skilful opponent might have
built up over the preceding rounds.
Twelve months later the pupil,
Rocky Marciano, met Jersey Joe Wal-
cott for the heavyweight boxing
championship of the world. Marciano
was thirteen stone two; Walcott
weighed fourteen stone and became
the first man to knock Marciano down
with a perfect left hook in the first
round.
Marciano rose at the count of three,
very annoyed, and began hitting at his
man with his short, powerful arms.
Walcott fought back with strength
beyond his age and the lead changed
from round to round: Marciano brawl-
ing away from a low crouch and the
champion, rubber-muscled, black-
skinned, and shining with sweat, back-
ing to the ropes and then shooting out
a round of blows and not finding the
target hard to reach.
Marciano took his punishment philo-
sophically and kept trying to lean in
so that his reach disadvantage would
not be too disastrous. Eyes were cut
and blood was let and the crowd was
sure getting its money’s worth. In the
thirteenth Marciano threw a right,
which, within the space of twelve inches,
caught Walcott on the point of the jaw
and the champion fell to the floor of
the ring unconscious. All the commen-
tators thought that Walcott was lead-
ing on points and needed only to stay
up for the next two rounds to keep
the title, but, as trainer Charlie Gold-
man said: “Rocky equalised.”
Rocky records that on the morning
of September 24, 1952, he woke up in
a hotel room in Philadelphia: “You
know how it is when you wake up in
a strange place and at first you don’t
know where you are. ‘Something
nice happened to me,’ I thought to my-
self, and then I remembered. ‘That’s
right, last night I won the heavyweight
championship of the world.’ When I
tried to turn it seemed like my whole
body was sore. I had cuts that had
been stitched over both eyes and
another on the top of my head, but I
was as happy as I think anybody can
be. Walcott had given me the toughest
fight I’d ever had, but I knocked him
out in the thirteenth round, and I was
heavyweight champion.”
How did it feel to be champion?
The Rock recalls: “When you become
heavyweight champion, something
comes between you and other people,
even your family. Everybody stands
back a little, not because of anything
you do but because of what you are,
even though you try so hard to pre-
vent it. You end up a lonesome guy in
a crowd.”
He was often a lonesome guy in the
ring, too. He had 49 professional fights
and won 42 by knockouts. For a heavy-
weight he was not heavy (he was more
than two stone lighter than Cassius
Clay’s fighting weight) and he was
about an inch under six feet. He had
the shortest reach of all heavyweight
champions. He had thick thighs and
calves, wide shoulders, a huge neck,
short thick arms, enormous physical
strength, and an apparent insensitivity
to any kind of physical pain. Many
fighters boxed the ears off him for the
first half of a bout, but the Rock just
kept walking up throwing left hooks
and straight rights. After a while his
more elegant opponents would look a
little tired, then a bit scared, and
their arms would fall from a guarding
position and they would take a few
blows on the jaw and fall down. After
the second Charles fight, Liebling
records the description of events as seen
by Freddie Brown, an old East Coast
fighter with a dished-in nose and quick
eyes:
“Charles comes in in a good mental
condition and he started right in to
execute Biff. . . . but Rocky is
coming in ... it is very hard to think
when you are getting your brains
knocked out ... so Charles withdraws
to consider the situation . . . that
puts him further from a position where
he can execute. Meanwhile Marciano
is still coming in. He is cruel. Charles
hits him with a good right to the jaw,
and Rocky hits him with a left hook
and a right. First thing Charles knows,
he is grabbing, and then he is just try-
ing to hang on. Why? He don’t know
why. It is not like football . . . Rocky
never gives you the ball.”
says that he thought of
a comeback a few years ago when
Floyd Patterson and Ingemar Johann-
son were the leading heavies. He went
into training in a camp in the moun-
tains, but could not recover his old
fighting spirit. “I just did not have the
incentive,” he says. Asked if he could
have beaten Clay at his top he replies,
“I am not a man known for boasting,
but I would be dishonest if I said I
did not think I could take Clay. Sure
he is fast, but he has never met a man
who could hit him hard and a lot.”
Rocky invested some of his ring win-
nings in an insurance company and he
works for the company as a P.R. man.
He also makes money as a guest
referee, as a boxing writer, as a spon-
sor of promising boxers. And he is
writing a book. He is not rich, his
shareholding is solid enough for com-
fort, and he remembers Jack Dempsey
advising him that it was not enough
to rely on annual dividends, you had
to make something weekly, too.
The bruised, honest face grins a lot
when he talks. He is very courteous
for a heavyweight champion and very
conscious of the dignity of his former
station: “I didn’t know that being
heavyweight champion was almost a
fulltime job, and that the influence
you have on people is sometimes so
strong that it worries you and can even
bring tears to your eyes.” He is now
a fulltime ex-champion, possibly the
best, and certainly the most popular
champion in the history of the Fancy.

THE OTHER SEX
This Spring, Last Spring
THE only man at
Germaine
Roch e r ’ s
spring collection in
Sydney had a lovely
time. Straight away
Madame Vera Fels
who is Germaine
Rocher) pounced
on him. Verbally,
that is.
“I have great
pleasure to see one
man in the audience,” she announced
into a microphone behind grey silk cur-
tains. “He is the only one, so you have
to look at him.”
The audience, of mostly middle-aged
ladies, looked and cheered. Herr Hans
Breitgraf, Vice-Consul and Head of the
Economic Department of the Federal
Republic of Germany, blushed and in-
clined his head modestly.
We savored his sartorial splendor for
a while, a grey three-piece suit, grey
striped tie, white shirt, and noted his
impeccable well-shot cuffs. Then we
examined the rest of the audience. With
one or two exceptions, e.g., a suit of
bright green and cyclamen, a turquoise
maternity dress, an all-red ensemble
belonging to a lady who, it was said,
looked perfectly groomed even when
taking the children to school in the
Mercedes, the clothes were of sombre
hue. Which, as someone remarked,
made the diamonds stick out a mile.
We noted, too, lots of spectacles with
heavy pointed frames and thought how
unfortunate that two almost identical
white space-age specs should be sitting
together. And the abundance of flowery
hats we attributed to Melbourne con-
nections.
As for the collection. Well, we think
it madness to say this is what everyone
in Sydney will be wearing this spring
and summer because (a) It all costs so
much and (b) Madame Fels’ taste isn’t
everyone’s.
As far as we could make out,
Madame Fels is a sort of super shopper
who goes regularly to France and buys
from high-fashion salons, then, inspired
by what goes on in Paris, returns to
Australia and designs a few things her-
self.
In her opening chat she said she
brought 150 models from France, and,
throughout, the magic names of Dior,
Castillo, Givenchy, Courreges, etc., etc.,
fell upon Paris-hungry ears. The goodies
attached to these status labels were, to
us, anything but magical. Enchant-
ment went out of the window after the
first ten minutes, when we’d settled
down to the atmosphere and had a bit
of an argument as to whether crooked
hems were in of out.
It was all so old-fashioned, with fly-
ing panels, side slits, and things like
knee-length skirts and the odd tent
coat, but everyone else oooh’d and
aaah’d in the right place, so we don’t
suppose Madame Fels will be ruined.
Her customers were all eager to shake
hands and make appointments to return
next day, but it seemed odd to us that
they should be keen to pay the earth
for the same clothes they had worn for
the past oh, say, five years.
On the credit side, we decided there
were two Jean Patou jobs we’d not say
no to. The first, a mandarin-looking
garment in a mixture of orange, green,
and lemon, we thought might be fun to
watch television in. The second, a strap-
less white evening dress, the mechanics
of which must have given Monsieur
Patou many a sleepless night, and we
weren’t surprised that Herr Hans Breit-
graf picked that as his favorite, too.
Maybe, of course, Madame Fels is
supplying what the ladies of Sydney
want. Maybe it is their taste and judg-
ment that is lopsided. Anyway, we had a
bit of a chat with her at the end, but
we didn’t get very far with prices be-
cause she never reveals them to the
Press. Neither did we get too far with
a story that she is to retire. She is buy-
ing a flat in Paris to have a place of
her own when she goes there instead of
putting up at hotels. But retire? Never.
However, we did get somewhere with
Yves St. Laurent, the most acclaimed
Paris designer this season, last season,
and probably every season to come. She
hates him.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
A Creative Fellow
By PHILLIP ADAMS
AS befits an avant-garde composer,
George Dreyfus spends much time
conducting lofty pieces to empty
seats in draughty halis. As well, to the
horror of more cloistered colleagues,
he can be found clutching a fevered
brow as he fights rock singers to get
clarity of diction for a TV jingle. Per-
haps to save him from the seduction
of admass for the proper martyrdom
of unattended concerts, the Australian
National University has awarded Drey-
fus its third Creative Fellowship. Pre-
vious incumbents: Sidney Nolan and
John Perceval.
Hard on the ANU’s heels, UNESCO
this week awarded Dreyfus a six
months’ fellowship in the creative arts,
the first such award to an Australian for
many years. Dreyfus will study con-
temporary composition at the Rhenish*
Music School, Cologne, where one of
the teachers is Stockhausen. This
means deferring the Canberra stint for
six months, but means, too, that Drey-
fus’ course is set for the next 18
months.
Dreyfus was born in 1928 to a
wealthy family in Wuppertal, an indus-
trial town in the Rhineland. The Drey-
fuses had long since renounced Ortho-
dox Judaism, and to prove their dedi-
cation to Aryan norms, his grandfather
had served in the Militia, and his
great-aunt could play all the scores
and sing all the roles of Wagner. But
this was not enough for the Third
Reich, who soon cast a cold shadow
over their comfortable, cultured lives.
So as to conform with the law requiring
Jewish children to attend Jewish
schools, the family moved to Dahlem
(“the Toorak of Berlin,” says Drey-
fus, “of course, the Americans live
there now”), and it took all his father’s
money and ingenuity to make the next
move their last-minute escape to
Australia.
George Dreyfus and his brother came
first—in a convoy of 20 children
addressed to the Francis Barkman home
in Melbourne —and his parents arrived
six months later. George remembers his
father as a flamboyant dilettante (“He
was a good pianist—and he went to
a party in St. Kilda naked except for
a bowler hat”) who became deeply
embittered by poverty.
Dreyfus remembers his years at Mel-
bourne High with mixed feelings. He
loved playing bassoon in the orchestra,
but suffered at the hands of the school’s
anti-semites “In deference to my
father, I was studying commerce, and
the teacher delighted in making me
read to the class about the function of
pawnbroking. There were lots of things
like that until the revelations on Ausch-
witz.”
He began singing in a synagogue,
living on the £2 a week he earned, and
studied the bassoon at home. At this
stage music meant performance not
composition, and at 19 he was trium-
phant when he got a job as a bassoon-
ist in the pit for JCW. The season was
one of Italian opera and for over a
year he played Verdi and Puccini under
the baton of Maestro Ghioni. (“But he
kept trying to have me sacked for being
such a rotten player.”) Next came a
season of Borovansky and then 12
months of “South Pacific.” While play-
ing “There Is Nothing Like a Dame”
300 times, he submitted a stream of his
own love songs to an ABC competition,
all of which were rejected. (“I was a
virgin, so the lyrics were filthy.”) At the
same time he set Goethe to music in a
Mahler idiom. The influence of Schoen-
berg was yet to reach Melbourne.
Now he was 21, his father had died,
and so had the ABC’s bassoonist. So
George joined the Victorian Symphony
Composer George Dreyfus.
Orchestra. (“The only way you could
get in was through a fatality.”) He
played under Castro (“intensely per-
sonal”) and Susskind (“incredibly
efficient”), was enthralled by playing
the masterpieces and appalled by play-
ing them so badly. So he wrote to
Professor Oehlberger in Vienna re-
puted to be the world’s greatest bassoon
teacher and was accepted as a
student. He had some Wiedergut-
machung (restitution) money to live
on, and married a Melbourne flautist
in London. Together they travelled to
Vienna, where “I had lessons and she
had asthma.”
They returned to Australia for the
birth of their twin children, and George
rejoined the ABC. Now that he felt
himself to be a competent bassoonist,
performance lost its interest and he be-
gan composing seriously. As well he
became a missionary for avant-garde
music, hiring bleak halls for those
lonely concerts. About this time, his
marriage failed.
In the -late ’sos, George got new
stimulus from the sudden onrush of
LPs, books, and magazines from Europe
and the U.S. His work quickly re-
sponded, and in 1960 he won his first
award—the Louis Lavater Prize—for
a Britten-ish cycle of British songs.
“My mates won’t like this,” he said.
“There’ll be letters to the Editor. But
a work of mine was the first piece of
local contemporary music to be per-
formed in Australia.” This was “Music
in the Air,” a work influenced by Stock-
hausen, using words by Ronald Mc-
Cuaig.
That same year, he remembers that
the British Music Society had him and
his New Music Ensemble play for them.
(“They were aghast. Haven’t let me
near the place since.”) And he met
Tim Burstall and Pat Ryan,, of Eltham
Films, scoring 12 episodes of their
children’s TV series “Sebastian the
Fox.” This new activity was particu-
larly valuable, as through it George
broke free “from the narrow confines of
music. I met people in theatre, art,,
literature.”
He was unhappy at the VSG
(“Wasn’t everybody?”) and two years
ago set out to become a full-time com-
poser. He lives alone, and works a
nine-to-five five-day week. He scored
a number of documentary and children’s
films, wrote a wind quartet, provided
the music for a filmed ballet starring
Kathleen Gorham, and is struggling
with a two-act opera called “Garni
Sands.” But he admits that he gets
more pleasure out of composing jingles.
An unlikely sight in the high-gloss
agency context, he arrives for meetings
in the most decrepit car thus far to
elude the Victoria police. Small, bald-
ing, owlish, he speaks and laughs in
an awesome foghorn, and insists on the-
most unnerving vocal and orchestral
combinations. His major work for
advertising has been a jingle for Alcoa
Aluminium in which he juxtaposed a
rock-’n-roll group with a coloratura
soprano. “I’m nothing if not uninhi-
bited,” he says, but forgives those clients
that flee his auditions to seek out more
conservative arrangers.
Dreyfus is deeply concerned with the
role of serious music—and in despon-
dent moments wonders whether it has
a role at all. He hopes that perhaps
big business can be encouraged to sub-
sidise music—the Ford Foundation in
the U.S. has sponsored 118 operas
alone since the war (“I suppose most
of them were diabolical. But still!”) —
and is looking forward to the com-:
pletion of the Sydney Opera House
with something approaching lust. And
he takes his Canberra appointment very
seriously. “I’m giving up politics and
James Bond films and I’m going to be
a nice, reliable member of the Estab-
lishment. I’m going to churn out opuses
like a mad thing.”

ON FILM
Melbourne The Right Climate
IN all the talk about lack of official
help for Australian film makers,
everyone seems to have ignored the
fact that, in Victoria, film directors
creating experimental works are
actually being given assistance by the
State. The State Film Centre in Mel-
bourne makes copies of these films
free of charge, carries their distribution
costs, and frequently puts money into
their production as well; equipment is
given or lent. A small film class on
the premises trains young enthusiasts
in the art and technique of the film,
and it’s easy to sense in Melbourne a
definite sharpness of interest in motion
pictures that seems to go with the
whole city’s sensitivity to the things of
the mind. The confidence and optimism
of the young film makers I met was a
deeply moving thing. Here is a climate
for film-making that indifferent Sydney
should envy.
Helped by the Film Centre, Peter
Tammer has made “Beethoven and all
That Jazz,” in which music is expertly
linked to cleverly cut visuals; and “On
the Ball,” about people at a football
match. Brian Davies has made “Watt’s
Last Voyage,” a short of poetic, elusive
charm about an old man living near
the sea on some desolate mud-flats.
On the basis of a script or outline
presented by a young director, the
Centre immediately makes funds avail-
able (up to $6OO-$800) or offers to
come in at the end buying prints. A
similar, and no less admirable, scheme
known as Unifed has been, set up by
the film societies in Victoria: out of
profits from the Melbourne Film Festi-
val, up to $2OOO is advanced to inde-
pendent film makers to cover their
shooting costs. The one black spot on
an otherwise splendid scene is the dis-
gusting failure of the Sydney and other
Film Festivals to display these Aus-
tralian young people’s films, some of
which have won prizes in Europe: the
appalling snobbery of Festival selection
committees here is once again exposed.
The Film Centre is entirely financed
by the Victorian State Government,
whose remarkable enlightenment is now
about to be still further demonstrated by
a sumptuous new Film Centre in the
heart of Melbourne. The present
premises are to be abandoned in 18
months for a superbly designed com-
plex of offices, public and private
theatres, libraries, and storerooms, offer-
ing a turnover of 70,000 films a year
for the use of film societies. Even now,
the Centre does a dynamic job of dis-
tributing material to societies (includ-
ing separate and handsome leaflets on
these young Australians’ experimental
films), releasing films, and running
the best film book library in Australia,
with invaluable sets of magazines of
great rarity; here, unknown to the
country, is a repository comparable
with the British Film Institute book-
room in London; there is no American
parallel I know of. Material they have
distributed on films, Australian and
foreign, is of extraordinary size and
high quality.
In other states, the supine equivalents
of the Film Centre simply cannot be
compared with this dynamic organis-
ation. In their pleasant little private
theatre, in the agreeable , company of
their intelligent and thoroughly profes-
sional staff, I was able to see a group
of the films the Centre has helped bring
into being. The best of these was John
Bale’s moving and erotically charged
“Portrait of a Girl;” cut to a piano
and high-pitched solo voice singing a
wordless atonal accompaniment, the
camera explores in a dazzling series
of brief cuts the making up of a girl’s
face, probing into eyes as brushes move
across lashes, into the mouth as a lip-
stick moves across it in a daring use of
sexual symbolism. Bale is obviously very
talented: his “Yarra Bank” is a film
study of.jspeakers on the river’s flanking
park, and I shall not easily forget the
closeups of the faces of the old mean-
ingfully contrasted with the quiet beauty
of the young people listening: I found
this exciting.
iQTHER films of great interest I saw
at the Centre were: “The House
With a Secret,” which won first prize in
an international film contest for young
people’s films in Italy (Chris Lofven
was the director of this story about a
young girl and a lonely, empty house);
“Fun Radio” was good, too: directed
by Nigel Buesst, a former fashion pho-
tographer, it ruthlessly sent up disc
jockeys, whose chatter was intercut with
a series of shots of cars, suburban cot-
tages, and other empty symbols of our
civilisation.
Beyond shorts, features: and in Mel
bourne, Brian Davies has been shooting
with the aid of Unifed a film, “The
Pudding Thieves,” about two porno-
graphic photographers, which promises
well. In New Zealand, with nothing
equal to the marvellous Melbourne set-
up, John O’Shea, director of “Run-
away,” has raised from private business-
men the money (not much under
£40,000) to make a fine teenage musi-
cal, “Don’t Let It Get You,” with
Normie Rowe and Howard Morrison,
the superb Maori singing star. Although
too evidently influenced by Richard
Lester’s “A Hard Day’s Night,” and
marred by amateurish acting, this is a
polished professional job, photographed
with great skill on New Zealand and
Sydney locations by Tony Williams.
One sequence especially of Morri-
son’s ride along a lonely seashore on
horseback, shot from a helicopter to the
song “I’m Home Now” is thrillingly
staged. This area is producing inventive
film makers after all, one is excited to
learn: all we need now are Festivals to
push the shorts, and distributors to push
the features, and everyone to forget their
snobbery about the Anzac product.

TELEVISION
BBC’s Predicament
DESPITE many TV comedy suc-
cesses, BBC Television has proved
that it can, with a little effort,
make a show as bad as any Australian
one. This will be possibly the best yard-
stick by which to judge the ABC’s
forthcoming “Nice and Juicy” and
the Channel 7 series “My Name’s
McGooley.” In the British comedy
series “A World of His Own,” Stanley
(Roy Kinnear) and his wife' enjoy
togetherness on the beach, while shop-
ping, in cleaning out the attic, and so
forth. At least once, but usually two or
three times during these mundane
moments, something said or seen rockets
him off into mostly' funny flights of
fancy. He imagines he is a beach-
comber, an artist, a bull-fighter, a cook
for the Borgias.
Recently he was a British long-
eared bat, trying to roost in a zoo cage
which was strictly for exotics, such as
an Indian mango b,at. He was advised
to fly BOAC to Taronga Park. What
kind of AC? 8.0., of course; which
gives you an idea of the kind of humor.
As an artist he is confronted by a naked
woman who has fallen into a goose-
berry bush. “You can see my predica-
ment.” “No, I can’t, but I can imagine
it.” It’s screened by ABC Television
at 6.30 p.m., to be sure your children
grow up with a tatty sense of humor.
In Sydney, that is. In Melbourne at
6.30 this time of year they have films
of the VFL football.
TELEVISION has other odd habits in
Melbourne, such as screening “The
Private World of Miss Prim” at 7.30
p.m. in opposition to “Homicide,”
which is said to be watched in three of
five TV homes.
During two recent weeks I watched
Miss Lake’s series again, hoping it
would have improved with age. As you
may know, it began in poor shape, with
a complicated plot which took the
viewer, finally, in and out of one dream
sequence, rarely even as laughable as
those in “A World of His Own” or in
the cartoon series “King Leonardo and
His Short Subjects,” which has a zany
turtle who daydreams.
Three weeks ago “Miss Prim” began
with involvement in a wheezy plot
wherein her boss was trying to buy his
wife a present and keep it secret.
The next week she was caught in a
lift with her boss the novelette pub-
lisher, the lift driver, another girl, and
a novelette writer. After much falling
over one another, and the uncomfort-
able delivery of many weak jokes, bits
of banter, and sundry witticisms, Miss
Lake, or “Miss Prim,” launched another
daydream in which she played one of
her better characters, a wilful little
schoolgirl surrounded by steaming
adults. It was moderately humorous. I
noted in the credits that Dick Barry,
who wrote her sketches last year, was
back in the team.

THIS has been a bumper season for
multiple recordings. Reader's
Digest’s famous “God it’s terrible,
God it's wonderful, and God” polio;
for subject matter does not extend to
its recording area; here, the mood is
one of surprising pagan enjoyment.
“The Great Band Era,” in fact, is the
richest and most enjoyable collection
of records I have ever owned; and its
range is astonishing. The period covered
is from the mid-’Thirties, when the
Big Bands first got off the ground with
Benny Goodman, through the “sweet”
ensembles Hal Kemp and Tommy
Dorsey notable among them to the
raw and brassy vitality of Harry James,
the vulgar, but undeniably stimulating,
flair of Gene Krupa, and the delectably
sophisticated and deft Glenn Miller.
For my money, the one dominant
genius of the whole period, so often
underrated and misunderstood, is Artie
Shaw. A difficult and rather remote
figure, much-married and sometimes
sneered at by hard-core jazz fanatics,
he emerges on numbers like “Frenesi”
(Record 10, Side One) with dazzling
skill: his entry at the beginning has a
delicate and intricate beauty that time
has not touched. As an added bonus,
one can hear those voices which, even
more than the bands, evoke a period
and sting one’s nostalgia: Frank
Sinatra, altogether softer, slighter, and
less assure d than in his great period
( the ’Fifties); the Modernaires; the
hideous Andrews Sisters; and Vaughn
Monroe, unforgettably singing “Tan-
gerine.” If there is one film sequence
that sums up the ’Forties it is the final
one in Billy Wilder’s “Double In-
demnity”: curtains drawn, Barbara
Stanwyck in fluffy slippers saying “Hold
n ? e close, Walter”; Fred Mac Murray

The Swing Years covers much the
same period on a smaller scale, with
marvellous things like. Duke Ellington’s
“Perdido,” Glenn Miller’s brash
“Pennsylvania 6-5000,” Bunny Beri-
gan’s classic “I Can’t Get Started,” and
Cugat’s unashamedly ritzy “Night Must
Fall.” Best of the lot, of course, is
Guy Lombardo’s “September in the
Rain,” which conjures up a slightly
seedy city street, a cocktail bar, a
sprinkling shower outside the glass, and
a woman j n f urS; wa.iting; an image one
has seen in a hundred marvellous
’Forties films. “Let’s Go Latin” brings
one up t 0 date with a bump: slick,
smooth, but deprived of the indispen-
sable elements of nostalgia, which, for
the specialist, are again amply to be
found in A 1 Jolson’s raucous, glittering,
superbly professional songs, brought
together on an album box that deserves
to make recording history,

Rush to the Colors
Night of the Ding Dong. Ralph Peter-
son. South Australian Theatre Com-
pany. Russell Street, Melbourne.
THE colonel expresses doubt as to
the virility of a would-be son-in-
law, and as he protests his man-
hood the young man absently fondles
and shreds a daisy. While delivering a
homily on moderation, the colonel
piously pours himself a monster whisky.
Most local comedy playing has lacked
even this elementary visual “business,”
relying instead on radio-type vocal em-
phasis over-modulated dialogue and
heavily stressed punch lines, just in
case we miss the point. But there’s little
that’s gauche about this production. Be-
tween them writer Peterson and pro-
ducer John Tasker have achieved some-
thing very close to a comedy of man-
ners.
A Russian gunboat full of sailors
with “nihilist written all over their
faces” is seen in the Bight, and 1870’s
Adelaide fears an invasion might be
threatening. The colony’s only protec-
tion is a half-built fort and a regiment
of soldiers used as garnishing at parties.
But with the newspaper talking of a
veritable armada of rapists, there’s a
rush to the colors. And when some-
one accidentally ignites a signal flare,
having huffed and puffed themselves
into an attack of the patriotic DTs, the
military gallop off in all directions.
Women swoon, colonels topple off
horses, the jerry-built fort collapses,
and an embarrassing time is had by all.
The play is at least half an hour too
long, too much of the dialogue is re-
iterative and padded, and there are
some unforgivable lines such as, “It
only hurts when I smile.” Yet for all
this, Peterson’s play is very funny in-
deed and generally well written. He
uses period affectations, cold-war paral-
lels, and parochial “in” jokes to get his
laughs (there’s a reference to “young
Bonython”), and employs a strong sub-
plot very ingeniously. This concerns a
young schoolteacher of pacific tempera-
ment who desires the hand of the
colonel’s daughter, and who alone
doubts the reality of the Russian threat.
The part has the best lines and a
fine actor. Dennis Olsen, who manages
to look like a faded Victorian photo-
graph, combined uncertain movements
with positive opinions in an extremely
clever performance.
The other acting honors went to two
cameo parts. Gordon McDougall was
superb as a you-scratch-my-back-I’ll-
scratch-yours building contractor, and
given a few monosyllabic lines as a
retarded debutante Jennifer Hagan
stole a large share of the show. Ron
Graham played the Blimpish colonel,
Meta McCaffrey his philosophical
mother, Anne O’Shaughnessy the flut-
tering, swoon-prone daughter, and, less


satisfactorily, Loriel Smart was his nerv-
ous wreck of a wife.
Bleak instead of ornate, open when
it should be crowded, the set is an
atrocity. Where the play requires an
elegant, over-dressed drawing-room the
crinolines glide around what appears to
be a deserted railway station.
PHILLIP ADAMS
After the Nazis
Altona. Jean-Paul Sartre. National
Theatre of Western Australia. Old
Tote, Sydney.
“ A LTONA” raises the question of
_ the collective guilt of the Ger-
mans for the Nazi regime. The
play is set in a mansion near Hamburg,
the home of the Gerlaeh family, in the
year 1959. Old von Gerlaeh, the owner
of one of the world’s biggest ship-
building yards, has devoted his life to
the pursuit of wealth and power. He
did not like the Nazis, but he co-
operated with them for the sake of his
business and family. In 1941 he sold a
piece of land to Himmler for an exter-
mination camp, on the grounds that his
refusal would achieve nothing useful
and merely win him disfavor with the
regime. But his father’s deal with the
Nazis led to the moral destruction of
his eighteen-year-old son, Franz, his be-
loved heir.
Franz, horrified by the camp, de-
fiantly sheltered a Polish rabbi who was
trying to escape. His father’s influence
saved his life, but it did not save him
from seeing the rabbi beaten to death
by the Gestapo. This perverted his
moral nature, and before the war was
over he had himself tortured prisoners.
When the play begins Franz has been
living alone with his tormented con-
science in a locked room in his father’s
house for thirteen years. He sees only
his sister Leni, with whom he has an
incestuous relationship. He spends his
time recording windy messages on tape
addressed to the inhabitants of the thir-
tieth century who are crabs, men hav-
ing destroyed themselves by that time.
The complicated story of Franz and
his tormented conscience, which Sartre
presents in a highly melodramatic
fashion, is difficult to take seriously.
That the Nazis were able to come to
power because men like old Gerlaeh
compounded with them seems very
plausible. But that they succeeded in
any large-scale perversion of sensitive
young men into neurotic sadists is
harder to swallow.
In “Altona,” Sartre has written an
old-fashioned play in which the heavy-
drama matches the cumbersome nine-
teenth-century furniture of the house in
which it is set. Edgar Metcalfe’s pro-
duction matches it. However, it is a
workmanlike production which com-
pares more than favorably with the
Melbourne contribution to this inter-
state theatre season. It contains one
outstanding performance by Peter
Collingwood as the father, which is
low-keyed, intelligent, and subtle.

FILMS
Ties That Bind
The Group. Director, Sidney Lumet.
Gypsy Girl. Director, John Mills.
SIDNEY LUMET has done an amaz-
ingly good job of filming Mary
McCarthy's intricate, densely
populated novel about the after-collegi
fives and relationships of a set of Vassar
girls in the New Ydrk of the ’thirties.
Though the film is long, it is eonstantly
interesting, with all the girls sharply
characterised, though naturally, as in
the novel, a few emerge as the most
striking. The switch of attention from
one to another is managed quite bril-
liantly, and the continuity, which must
have posed almost insuperable prob-
lems, is as smooth as silk. The subtle
color photography in itself makes the
film worth a visit.
So “The Group” is technically dis-
tinguished, but what’s more it accur-
ately reproduces the spirit as well as
the letter of the book. Its tone, like
Mary McCarthy’s, is detached, coolly
humorous, basically tough and realistic
in fact, completely female, always
looking at the story from a woman’s
viewpoint. Lumet gives a convincing
picture of the ’thirties while avoiding
caricature for this his designers also
deserve great praise and as well
manages to convey without sentimen-
tality the extraordinary durability of
a close adolescent “group” whose mem-
bers grow older, are separated by in-
terests, inclinations, and social position,
may even dislike each other but are

SHORT STORY BY LYNDALL HADOW
Period Piece
in a Teacup
WHEN the Collivers came to live
in Mayfair Place they were re-
ceived in a manner fitting their
position and circumstances.
Let it be known that you. have
for some years occupied a post in a
merchant and shipping firm in the Brit-
ish West Indies, to whose Western Aus-
tralian office you have now been trans-
ferred; let it be known that your wife
is a relative of a titled person in Eng-
land; the ladies of that secluded street
will approve, their reception of you
and yours manifest in the calling-cards
prepared for leaving, at the appropriate
hour, on your wife.
That is how it happened when the
Collivers settled in at “Cowes,” the
late Mr. Crispin’s villa in Mayfair
Place. The house had been in the
hands of Mr. Pringle, the gentleman
who for many years had attended to
the sales and leasing and rental of
high-class properties in this riverside
suburb; and it was from Mr. Pringle’s
office that the ladies had acquired
their knowledge of their new neigh-
bors. Mr. Pringle was known to the
ladies of Mayfair Place only because
of his association with their church;
one didn’t hold office for a lifetime as a
vestryman of St. Mark’s without be-
coming the friend and confidant of
those gentlewomen whose charities kept
open the doors of the ivy-covered
Colonial Gothic house of God. Cer-
tainly Mayfair Place had found, in
their lifetime, little need of Mr.
Pringle’s professional services; houses
were not bought or sold or leased out
at rental in that fastness of old
families . . . until Mr. and Mrs. Col-
liver came to “Cowes.” Then, Mr.
Pringle had placed himself on record
as being of the opinion “after my usual
discreet inquiries” that the newcomers
were worthy in every aspect of their
lives, past, present, and future, to
occupy the late Mr. Crispin’s villa. All
further information about the Collivers,
including geographical details of the
British West Indies and the ramifica-
tions of the county families of the
Motherland, arrived in Mayfair Place
via Mrs. Jones, the visiting dressmaker
(from across the railway line), whose
sister was the office young lady
employed by Mr. Pringle to work one
of those fangled though no longer new
inventions called a typing machine. The
typewriter young lady told her sister
about Mrs. Colliver’s titled relatives
and Mr. Colliver’s connection with the
shipping and merchant firm in Bar-'
bados; and her sister told the ladies
she sewed for. From that point on,
protocol ruled.
From their silver cases, from
tortoiseshell, from ivory, calling cards
were produced, two from this house-
hold, three from that; the ladies knew
the rules of the game. On their way
to each other’s At Homes, they left
cards at “Cowes” on the mother-of-
pearl tray proffered by the maidservant,
black-frocked, white-aproned, a well-
trained girl, along with the smoothly
whitened front steps, the polished
veranda floor, the shining brass of
door knocker and handle, a credit to
her mistress’ watchfulness. They must
ask young Mrs. Colliver where she’d
found her.
AFTER these gestures of neighbor-
liness and allowing a decent inter-
val of two weeks, Mrs. Colliver un-
hurriedly returned the calls, leaving her
own cards at the widowed homes, hers
and her husband’s at “The Gunyah,”
where Mrs. Fanning’s eighth and pre-
sumably last decade was still being
shared by Colonel Fanning, M.C.,
Indian Army (Ret’d), he having,
“through good living, Sir, and a devo-
tion to my country and my good wife,”
arrived at the estimable count of ninety-
nine. Mrs. Colliver also left her own
and her husband’s cards on the house-
hold at Number Five Mayfair Place,
where Madame Pfeiffer, young Mr.
Norman Pfeiffer, and Madame Pfeiffer’s
niece lived with Patches, Tatters, Crum-
pet, and Muffin, all, with the exception
of the niece, in varying stages of de-
cline. As Mrs. Colliver put it to her
husband, “We do seem to have chosen
an elderly neighborhood, Cecil,” an
observation which the maidservant Ella
had already, in other quarters, brought
to light.
“Old, all right, there’s not one of
them shouldn’t be in their graves by
now,” Ella could be heard to say to
her one confidante in the district, the
girl who worked in the lollyshop (next
door to Mr. Pringle’s estate agency).
“Old!” she pontificated, and with that
originality of expression which came,
it can be understood, from her having
stayed at school until she was fourteen
and a half, “Old as the hills, I’d say!”
On a higher level of expressiveness Mr.
Colliver would agree with his wife,
offering as his further opinion that
they seemed nice enough people for
colonials, adding that there was at
least nearer their own age Madame
Pfeiffer’s niece. In parallel case Ella,
as the lollyshop goddess pointed out,
should draw consolation from the fact
that her bosses weren’t old dodderers
like the rest of Mayfair Place. “Reely
they’re quite nice I’d think, by the
looks of them, especially him wouldn’t
you say?”
Ella would say, “Especially him.”
His wife had her At Homes. If you
lived in Mayfair Place, if you sub-
scribed to the belief that only child-
ren of the lower classes attended Sun-
day school as pupils, while young
women of the upper classes (those who
had a calling that way) attended as
teachers; if you agreed regarding the
unseemliness of over-the-garden-fence
peignoir gossip with neighbors, if the
exchange of a greeting and a rhetorical
inquiry as to your well-being and that
of your family were considered to be
sufficient in the way of neighborli-
ness when walking abroad, if and if and
if, then you belonged to that part of
Western Australian society which used
the At Home as a symbol of its place
in this world and a promise in the
future. Mrs. Colliver’s cards told those
on whose trays they reposed that she
was At Home at “Cowes,” second
Friday, three to five.
At Home! How well Mayfair Place


remembered that first occasion of their
formal calling on Mrs. Colliver. First
call of the afternoon they made it, leav-
ing Miss Cort unvisited for the only
time in rememberable years. Careful
not to outstay the 20 minutes allowed
by custom, not one of them had any
desire then to anti-climax that call with
Miss Cort and her companion, Miss
Fleet (who, after all, was really a
companion-housekeeper and should not
have the privilege of sitting with her
mistress on her At Home days), but
poor Miss Cort, daughter though she
might be of old Judge Cort himself
(the late Judge Cort), did tend to let
her biscuit drop in her teacup, and
Miss Fleet was needed to straighten out
the contretemps, so, while Miss Cort’s
front gate remained unopened, her
special China tea unpoured, the ladies
of Mayfair Place converged on Mrs.
Nettlefold, the only other of their peers
whose day coincided, second Friday,
three to five, with Mrs. Colliver’s.
At Mrs. Nettlefold’s, no one waited to
inquire after the health of Mrs. Nettle-
fold’s husband’s Aunt Jinny, who had
lain on her deathbed for the past 15
years in Saskatchewan, Canada. In-
stead, they compared impressions of
the newcomer in their midst, voicing
them in tones of bewilderment slightly
colored with concern for that nice
young Mr. Colliver himself and a
tremor of apprehension for the sanctity
of Mayfair Place institutions.
“Her aunt, of course . . .”
It was not interrupting Mrs. Quarter-
maine (because over the years it was
understood that Mrs. Quartermaine’s
sentences, like her attitudes to human
behaviour, never reached a conclu-
sion), for Mrs. Margitts to say, “Of
course, her aunt is a lady of great Chris-
tian principle, Lady Amelia Butter-
worth, daughter of the Earl of
Haverly. We must make no hasty judg-
ment.”
“ONE would have expected that the
influence of so fine a person as
Lady Amelia would have made Its
impression on this young woman.”
“We understand, do we not, that
young Mrs. Colliver spent much of her
girlhood in the company of her aunt?”
“Exactly! But other influences must
have been uppermost in her life.”
“I agree. We all agree, I’m sure,
that Lady Amelia’s influence must have
been overcome in some way for this
. . . this dreadful thing to have taken
possession of a young person’s life.”
Mrs. Margitts sighed deeply, settled
back on the red plush, abstractedly
gazed at the Georgian tongs while re-
sugaring her tea. “Yes, indeed!”
“I wish,” said Mrs. Nettlefold plain-
tively, “that someone would tell me
what this is about. I wasn’t at ‘Cowes’
this afternoon, you might remember.
I’m completely in the dark.”
“Well . . That was Mrs. Quarter-
maine.
“Mrs. Colliver is a suffragette!” That
was Mrs. Margitts.
That then was the situation after
the first of Mrs. Colliver’s At Homes.
The afternoon had begun well. At
“Cowes” there were photographs to
be admired, photographs of Barbadian
people and places, mementoes of Col-
liver colonial beginnings when the sugar
barons flourished. Clarence Colliver,
late of Barbados, Lieutenant-General of
Militia, and sometime Speaker of the
House of Assembly in that island.
Born 25th of January, 1770, died June,
1845, so the inscription read, he was
pictured severe in the dress of the day,
nothing so eye-catching as the uniforms
in Colonel Fanning’s photographs,
though the appurtenances of office in
the Speaker’s case certainly added im-
portance to the picture, a steel engrav-
ing from a portrait by Sir James Watson
Gordon, 1830. Socially and historically
the Colliver importance was readily
conceded by the ladies of Mayfair Place
that afternoon of Mrs. Colliver’s first
entertaining.
“And what a patrician face,” Madame
Pfeiffer enthused. “Don’t you agree,
my dear?”
Mrs. Margitts agreed. “Truly aristo-
cratic”: while Miss Pfeiffer, who was
never asked for an opinion, decided
privately that the present Mr. Colliver
was so much more handsome, warm,
and friendly-looking than his hawk-
nosed forebear. Mr. Colliver’s nose
wasn’t arrogant like that; it was a
nicer nose, helping with his friendly
eyes to give him a much more desir-
able air; at which secret thought Miss
Pfeiffer blushed, she hoped not notice-
ably, and hastily gave her attention to
other pictures in Mrs. Colliver’s draw-
ing-room. There were the mansions, hub
of each barony, some pure Georgian,
others forbidding fortresses, though she
wondered idly and unprofitably who
were to be forbidden? The black
people, descendants of freed American
slaves? Surely they knew their des-
tined place on the estates they worked?
Surely their eyes never strayed from
their huts in the fields to the lordly
structures, walls hewn from the rock,
that housed their masters? Forbidding,
nevertheless. Then there were pictures,
silver-framed again, of more modern
vintage, in Mrs. Colliver’s drawing-
room in Mayfair Place (some on the
piano-top, one on the canterbury).
Parties at “Shot Hall,” the ladies’
cricket eleven (chic straw boater hats,
blouses sleeved like legs-o’-mutton; skirts
whose hems genteelly kept within an
inch of the ground, and high-button
boots). So much for the lady
cricketers of this island in the sun.
Picnics at The Crane. “Ah, The
Crane,” sighed young Mrs. Colliver,
“the loveliest beach in the world.” That
apparently was where, out from Home
for a holiday with her aunt, she had
met Mr. Colliver. “Love at first sight.
My aunt wasn’t at all pleased. Eligible?
Of course! His people owned half the
island, you might say. But my aunt
thought I should stay with her for
life. I’m afraid I was a poor relation
and Aunt Amelia had given me a post
with her. I was her amanuensis and
travelling companion. Aunt travelled
widely; she was a very busy woman.”
The ladies nodded agreement.
“She was a leader of the women’s
suffrage movement in England.” Mrs.
Colliver glanced at the teapot on her
tray. “Tea, Mrs. Margitts? Mrs.
Quartermaine? No?” Then she dropped
her words clearly, no one could mis-
hear them, into the tea-and-cake-laden
atmosphere of the plushy drawing-
room that had, never, surely, in the
days of Mr. Crispin, heard so startling
an announcement. “Though I left my
aunt’s household to marry, I, too, am a
suffragette.”
'J'HE ladies of Mayfair Place took a
week to adjust to' the situation.
First, their husbands elucidated for
them that a leader of the women’s
suffrage movement and a suffragette
were equally blameworthy terms. In
their wisdom the ladies decided that,
due to her station, Lady Amelia had
thought it right and proper to lend
her name to the movement; a respon-
sibility, they were sure, that weighed
heavily on her but which she bore,
doubtless, with Christian fortitude. Mrs.
Colliver’s was, of course, a different
case. To join such an organisation of
her own free will spoke ill of her
judgment; and 'what, they asked
themselves, were her intentions now?
What plans had she on the society of
Western Australia? Did she expect to
turn Mayfair Place into a suffragette
camp? The ladies took a stand. Never
could it for one moment be thought that
they would support such a movement;
they would oppose it with everything in
their power; they would enlist the aid
of the Reverend Fordyce at St. Mark’s,
if necessary; and perhaps Colonel Fan-
ning would help. Could Mrs. Fanning
tentatively approach the Colonel? Mrs.
Fanning could. She did. And took some
time to recover from her confusion on
being told bluntly that she was a fool,
that women had had the vote in Western
Australia since the ’nineties, so there
was no possibility of Mrs. Colliver’s
wanting to turn Mrs. Fanning and her
friends into suffragettes.
Mrs. Fanning reported back to the
ladies (an expurgated version); the
ladies decided tactfully that due to the
Colonel’s greatly to be esteemed age,
he might be mistaken in his pro-
nouncement; they would await the
verdict of the Reverend Fordyce. This
tallied with Colonel Fanning’s, with
the addendum that the members of his
congregation should show to their mis-
guided sister a Christian forbearance
and by their loving patience, kindness,
and with the help of prayer bring her
back to the paths of righteousness. In
the meantime, of their Christian
charity they should pray for Lady
Amelia. A final exhortation covered
the conduct of the ladies toward their
fellow-parishioner Mr. Colliver, whose
unenviable position as husband of an
erring sister seemed, regrettably, to
have been overlooked. Kindness, cor-


diality, tactfully administered, were to
be his portion. The Reverend Fordyce
had no intention of risking the loss of
a member of his congregation who not
only contributed generously to the
plate but who had promised to take an
interest in the youth of the less for-
tunately situated part of the parish.
JNDEED, it was not difficult to be
pleasant to Mr. Colliver; a gentle-
man of frank demeanor, his courtesy to
the ladies and his manly approach to
their menfolk soon won the approval
of the neighborhood. He went each
day, Monday to Saturday, to the mer-
chant office in Fremantle, where, it
was understood, he held a position of
some consequence; twice a month to a
lodge meeting at night. In addition, his
interest was taken by the Young Men’s
Christian Association to the extent of
one night a week devoted in clement
weather to showing some of the local
young men from across the railway line
how to play cricket, their education in
this direction having been gained in a
vacant allotment or on the rough gravel
of a back street with a bat of packing-
case wood, wickets the übiquitous kero-
sine tin, the ball maybe a scarred relic
of last season’s play, acquired from the
local cricket club, more often than not
a moth-eaten discard of the tennis club;
even a small rubber ball filched from
a still be-napkinned brother or from a
sister monotonously bouncing it, with
complicated hand and arm routines and
much counting, against a wall ,or fence,
serving the purpose of the young Aus-
tralian teaching himself, on the wrong
side of the line, to play cricket. From
that Mr. Colliver brought them, then,
these sons of railway workers and road
menders, these sons of laborers and
carters, via the Young Men’s Christian
Association, on one clement evening a
week to better things; taught them in
his own time and as a labor of love,
a dedication, to play the game. On
inclement evenings, in the tin room at
the back of St. Mark’s Parish Hall, he
taught them to tie knots, Navy fashion.
His establishment, despite the uncer-
tainties inherent in its having a mistress
who confessed to suffragettism, seemed
well enough conducted. If you were
abroad at six in the morning you’d
find Ella whitening the front steps;
at 6.30 you’ll follow her progress from
the kitchen to the master bedroojn by
the tinkle of the morning-tea tray. For
a reason, unstated, Ella always set the
cups so they’d rattle against the tea-
pot. She needn’t have bothered. Mr.
Colliver was an early riser, too; he’d
be at the open window, his rich paisley
dressing gown decently sashed over silk
pyjamas, the morning paper on the
window seat; and Mrs. Colliver still
asleep in, as Ella once confided to the
lollyshop goddess, the too-tidy double
bed.
If you happened at eight o’clock still
to be ini the neighborhood, you’d see
young tftr. Colliver let himself out of
the house, dark-suited, bowler-hatted,
carrying yellow chamois gloves, swing-
ing his cane with an inconsequential
air; along the quiet, garden-bordered
footpath he’d go, across the main road,
through the arbored park to the rail-
way station and the anonymity of the
steam train which would carry him to
his desk in the merchant and shipping
house where he spent his day. Regularly
at 5.30 in the evening he would alight
from a first-class smoker of the 5.10
from Fremantle, a Daily News under
his arm, paying his respects by a lift of
his cane to the station master at his
office door, moving slowly with the
crowd to show his season ticket to the
porter, waistcoated, peak-capped, at the
barrier; then through the ticket hall to
the street. Fine evenings in summer
would see him making his cheerful way
down the main street, through the park,
and home to “Cowes,” where Ella, en-
gaged in the kitchen, might hear his
happy “Anyone home?” as he left his
hat, stick, and gloves on the hallstand.
On winter evenings he’d arrive from the
station in Mr. Jensen’s cab, which would
pull up in the drive, right at the front
steps, Mr. Colliver emerging from its
highly varnished American-cloth interior
by the half door and the round iron
step at the back, gaining the “Cowes”
front door with no need to unfurl his
umbrella, so skilful a cabbie was Mr.
Jensen and so well trained his horse.
“Turn ’im on a threepenny bit,” Mr.
Jensen claimed, though in living mem-
ory none had seen this done, the need
of such precision not having arisen.
“He’s certainly a nice gentleman,”
Ella would report to her friend over
the lollypop counter on her half-day
off. “If she’s home, she pours him
some tea an’ he sits and reads the
paper, he gives her a piece of it, not
like some that won’t have it mussed up,
they don’t expect their wives want to
read it, anyway.”
“An’ if she’s not there when he
gets home? Only you. What happens
then?”
If revelations were expected, Ella’s
friend would be disappointed. “He
pokes his head into the kitchen. ‘Your
mistress out?’ he asks, and even before
I can say, ‘Yes, sir, the mistress is
out,’ like she told me, he asks, ‘ls
there a cup of tea for me, Ella?’ A
nice, warm-hearted gentleman he is, I’d
say. He has his cup of tea in the
drawing-room an’ reads his paper an’ I
must say he looks lonely when he has
his dinner by himself in that big
dining-room. I feel sorry for him, I
really do.”
“Don’t suppose he feels sorry for you,
eating your dinner by yourself in that
big kitchen. Can’t see why you don’t
get a good situation like mine.”
At the other end of the social scale,
that seemed to be the opinion of Mrs.
Colliver’s neighbors. “Gallivanting,”
they called it. “Neglecting her wifely
duties.” And when Ella answered the
door one afternoon, still wearing her
morning work dress of galatea, and,
omitting to hold a salver, took a prof-
fered note in her hand, saying, “I’ll
give it to her when she comes home,”
speculation increased as to just what
effect Mrs. Colliver’s behaviour could
be having on her servant.
Through all such conjecture and
comment, Mrs. Colliver moved on her
course, seemingly ignorant of the feel-
ing against her. “Cowes” At Homer
were still well attended, the ladies hav-
ing taken to heart the Reverend For-
dyce’s dictum on the helping of an
erring sister, though how tea and cake
and a little music, the hostess singing
to the accompaniment of young Miss
Pfeiffer, could be of any assistance to
Mrs. Colliver, no one seemed qualified
to say. On the other hand, Mrs. Col-
liver had taken an unprecedented stand
regarding the other At Homes of the
district. Charmingly but clearly she
had asked the indulgence of her neigh-
bors, asked to be excused from enjoying
their various afternoon hospitalities.
Charmingly she had explained that hav-
ing always lived a full and interesting
life in her aunt’s menage at home and
abroad, she must turn her energies,
here and now no longer demanded by
the female suffrage movement, into
some other channel.
“J KNOW you’ll understand and for-
give me,” she’d said, “when I tell
you just how much of my time is con-
sumed by my committee work.”
“Of course! Of course!” Agreement
was unanimous. Were they not or had
they not at some time been members
of the Ladies’. Auxiliary? And did they
not know just how such an obligation
could take up one’s time?
“And how I wish I could interest
some of my dear neighbors in this work
we’re engaged in. Such a big under-
taking, we need the goodwill of all
the community.”
The ladies would make vague affir-
mations of what they hoped would pass
as goodwill but which Mrs. Colliver
understood to convey a complete lack
of knowledge of her committee and
its work.
“You must let me explain.” At
length and again quite clearly Mrs.
Margitts, Mrs. Quartermaine, Mrs.
Fanning, Madame Pfeiffer, even young
Miss Pfeiffer, who should not have
been permitted to hear of such matters,


Why did
the world’s

stay at the
Sydney Sheraton?
To be sure it wasn’t just because our
rates are lower than those of most
other first-class hotels. Perhaps it
was because of our ultra-modern
rooms; central location; friendly
atmosphere; the unobtrusive pri-
vacy; our 24-hour room service; or all
of these reasons combined. Sheraton

were told of the committee for the
establishment of a maternity hospital
for unmarried mothers. “You might
find it difficult to believe how so many
hours of work by so many helpers can
show such little result. Lady Med-
hurst is our president, as you know.”
The ladies almost succeeded in per-
suading themselves (but not Mrs. Colli-
ver) that they had often read reports
of the committee’s activities under the
chairmanship of the Governor’s lady.
“And as her personal representative
on the committee, I’m really very much
occupied. When the hospital is built
and ready to receive its first unfor-
tunate mother . . Mrs.' Colliver’s
indication that then and only then
would she be able to take part in the
happy little afternoon gatherings in
Mayfair Place was received with amia-
bility and understanding. After all, the
Governor’s lady!
Even when the occasion arose that
Mrs. Colliver was asked to travel to
Albany as the personal representative
of Lady Medhurst (in the matter of
donations to the hospital building
fund), even then Mayfair Place tacitly
gave its blessing to her departure,
though a month they agreed was per-
haps overlong.
Mr. Colliver was heard to say he’d
miss his wife during that month, the
longest separation they’d yet endured in
their married life. He arranged to dine
at a hotel near the office on weekdays.
Madame Pfeiffer invited him to Sunday
dinners, and Ella would attend to his
breakfast. Ella herself elected to sleep
out, and that meant that her young
brothers had to treble-up in their
already inadequate bed in the family’s
weatherboard cottage on the other side
of the railway line; but she made up
for this inconvenience by bringing
home an occasional cornucopia of
brown paper which spilled forth its
marvels of broken sticky lollies, scrap-
ings of the display jars, generously do-
nated in the cause of family happiness
by Ella’s lollyshop friend whose god-
dess stature was immediately enhanced
in the eyes of the neighborhood
youngsters.
A change in the life of Miss Pfeiffer
was occasioned also by this absence of
Mrs. Colliver. Often throughout her
long life of genteel-sounding slavery as
a nursery governess to family after
family of the North West squattocracy,
Miss Pfeiffer was to ask God why Lady
Medhurst had chosen Mrs. Colliver as
her fund-raising emissary in the Great
Southern. God’s answer, to be through
the years somewhat confused with the
pronouncements of the Reverend For-
dyce, was to indicate to Miss Pfeiffer
that sin will find a way; and that
whether Lady Medhurst had sent Mrs.
Colliver or not, the end result for Miss
Pfeiffer would have been the same. With
which specious pronouncement the un-
fortunate young woman was expected
to satisfy her questioning of the ways
of God and of man.
Never did she divulge to friend, foe,
Mr. Fordyce or God the identity of the
father of her child. Questioned by all
in turn, she adhered to her story of an
attack by a man unknown to her, indeed
unseen in the darkness, as she walked
alone through the park from choir
practice to her home in Mayfair Place.
Never a mention of the sad and lovely
encounters, when, walking the younger
dogs, Muffin and Crumpet, she’d stayed
awhile in a prettier, more private arbor
than any the park provided. Never a
word of the hopes, the promises, the
plans; not even to Mrs. Colliver, called
in by a council of Mayfair Place Pfeiffer
cronies because of her association with
the hospital-for unmarried mothers, not
even to Mrs. Colliver (who didn’t ask,
anyway), did she alter her story of the
fearful encounter in the park.
»JHE hospital being only in its plan-
ning stages and Miss Pfeiffer’s infant
not being able to defer its arrival until
the project reached the speeches and
the cutting of the ribbon and the tea-
taking of the opening day, it was de-
cided at Mrs. Colliver’s suggestion that
Miss Pfeiffer make her home for the
next few months with a family in
Albany devoted to Lady Medhurst, to
Mrs. Colliver herself and her work for
the hospital. To this, Madame Pfeiffer
agreed. Madame Pfeiffer’s son Norman
agreed. Madame Pfeiffer’s niece, Miss
Pfeiffer, was not asked; she was sent.
Mr. Jensen’s cab called for her one
afternoon; in the highly varnished
American-cloth darkness of the cab’s
interior, she sat with her one small
piece of hand luggage, her tin trunk
having gone before. The Reverend For-
dyce and his wife sat opposite her.
They accompanied her into the train
to Perth, then took her to the home of
Mrs. Colliver’s friends in Albany, a
journey which endured one whole
night and more, throughout which
Mrs. Fordyce talked and snored
intermittently in the Ladies Only, which
she and Miss Pfeiffer were fortunate
to have to themselves.
Never again was Miss Pfeiffer to see
anyone from Mayfair Place. Nor was
she ever to know her child. “Better
that the mother should not see the
infant in a case such as this,” the doc-
tor pronounced; so, adoption being
arranged, all that remained for Miss
Pfeiffer was to recover quickly from
her confinement and to hide herself and
her tragedy a thousand miles from the
scene of its occurrence, somewhere in
the North West, there to remain, under-
paid, lacking privilege, a station gover-
ness.
The Lady Medhurst Hospital for un-
married mothers was opened to the sat-
isfaction of all concerned, especially
those men of the West (always a virile
race) who achieved fatherhood but de-
clined responsibility. Mrs. Colliver con-
tinued to work devotedly in its inter-
ests, the adopted child in her house-
hold making little difference to her
movements, Ella’s young sister being re-
cruited as nursemaid, Ella taking over
more responsibilities on the domestic
side. Mayfair Place, Miss Pfeiffer’s
tragedy assuming its place in history,
often wondered why Mrs. Colliver,
busy woman that she was, should have
bothered to adopt a child.
“Impulse,” she’d reply. “Uncontrol-
lable impulse! We never know where
our impulses will lead us, do we?”
Observing the nose of the infant, recog-
nising it for what it was (not the
aristocratic feature of the early Bar-
badian Colliver faces, but the broad-
ened nose that had found its way misce-
genately into their history), Mrs. Col-
liver had known immediately whose
impulses had led where in the matter
of Miss Pfeiffer and her child, and,
being a woman of action, had made the
appropriate moves. Happily, the boy
was to become a fine addition to May-
fair Place, a great companion for Mr.
Colliver, left more than ever to cricket
coaching and the tying of knots, Navy
fashion, as his wife spent more of her
time on conferences and committees.
“How like his father,” strangers often
said, leading to noncommittal agree-
ment by Mrs. Colliver and to good-
natured smiles from those who had
lived long in Mayfair Place and had
seen the storm through but didn’t see
something as plain as the nose on Mr.
Colliver’s face.

The Aid of the Party
By DAVID MARTIN
Journey to the Frontier. Peter Stansky
and William Abraham. Constable. $7.
JOHN CORNFORD’S first name,
which he refused to use, was
Rupert, in honor of Rupert Brooke.
The fact that he did not use it is as
significant as that he was so christened,
and it would be easy, if fatuous, to
speculate sentimentally on their com-
mon fate. Had he survived the Spanish
War he might have become a better
poet than Brooke; he was, by every
sign, one of the most gifted young men
of his generation. But he probably did
not see himself primarily as a poet
he was a Communist first and he
fell on his 21st birthday, on the Cor-
doba front, where his commander was
later shot as a fifth columnist.
Julian Bell, seven years younger,
was scarcely a Marxist, and never a
Communist. (He called Communism
“a dismal religion.”) His parents, Clive
and Vanessa Bell, were too firm in
their pacifism to name him even after
the most disillusioned war poet, yet
Julian was much more like Rupert
Brooke than was Cornford: the simi-
larities are rather striking. If, in his
short and restless life, he gave primacy
to anything it would have been to his
poetry, but there does not seem to have
been in it much scope for growth, and
he was always, despite his rebellion,
something of a dilettante in the 18th-
century style; this was his father’s ideal
as well as the ideal of some of his
older Cambridge friends who influenced
him. But he did not want to be a
dilettante; he wanted to be fully
engaged. (He wrote that, while no
cause is beyond reproach, this does not
free us from the responsibility of choos-
ing.) Turning his back on the Blooms-
bury he loved and hated, on the doubts
of his aunt, Virginia Woolf, and the
counsel of David Garnett, he reached a
compromise with his mother, whom he
adored and who abhorred all violence,
to go and drive an ambulance for the
Republic. A bomb found him at Brun-
ete.
(Where I met him, not knowing
who he was. His photograph at the
back of this book brought it back.
There can be no mistake even after
30 years: he was unforgettably hand-
some, a blond Saxon warrior.)
Cornford and Bell, different in almost
everything else, were sons of the same
class. They were sent, as a matter of
course, to Public Schools, where Julian
was miserable and John managed to
make himself content, as he could any-
where, compensating for his awkward
cricketing by a vast knowledge of the
game’s lore. From there they went up
to Cambridge, where Julian wrote his
best poetry and went out with the
beagles, and the other lived in sin with
a beautiful girl from the Young Com-
munist League, begot a child, and gave
promise as a scholar.
In both their lives, and notwith-
standing Cornford’s youth, the 1939
election was a turning point, but he was
better prepared to meet what followed.
His parents, too, were pacifists, and his
mother, Frances, a minor Georgian
poet. However, he ruthlessly criticised
her work when he was still at school,
and when he set out for Spain his
father gave him his own revolver.
Of the British who formed the
Attlee battalion, two out of three be-
coming casualties, over 80 percent were
workers and wage-earners. But many
now seem to think of it as a battalion
of writers and intellectuals, and there’s
a reason: it is today’s intellectual who*
looks back to the ’thirties with mixed
longing and despair, and on
Madrid as a glorious dream.
Spender, thinking of the writers of the
previous decade, once wrote that the
qualities which mainly distinguished his
contemporaries from them “lay not
in ourselves but in the events to which
we reacted.” Neither Bell nor Cornford
were altogether typical poets of the
’thirties. Bell, only reluctantly joining
the New Signatures band, still opposed
“himself” to “events,” and his purest
strain was pastoral. His main object
of study was Pope. Cornford admired
the new Robert Graves and T. S. Eliot,
and saw in “The Waste Land” a re-
flection of Capitalism in decay. When
the test approached he at least was
entirelv in harmony with events. He
crossed the spiritual barricade which
Auden, Spender, MacNeice, and Day
Lewis could not finally surmount, and
took the road of Eluard and Aragon.
Though Communism was my waking
time,
Always before the light of home
Shone clear and steady and full in
view
Here, if you fall, there’s help for
you
Now, with my Party, I stand quite
alone.
•So urgent was his need to enter the
battle that in his first rush he found
himself before Huesca in the ranks of
the # POUM. Julian Bell’s way was
far more tortuous. But those who
seek to understand the commitment
which compelled the most courageous
on the Liberal side to go so far beyond
traditional Liberalism will learn more
from what happened to him.
He was looking for a new rationale,
for an existence which had ceased to
make sense. He belonged to an elite
which had always accepted its relative
isolation with good grace, because it
was part and parcel of its leadership
ethos and aesthetics. When it fought,
it fought with the weapons of the mind.
The great war, from which Julian’s
circle had managed to retain a certain
aloofness, but which nevertheless had
breached its defences, had left orthodox
Bloomsbury with the conviction that
between one barbarian and another no
valid choices could be made. But now,
for the first time, ideas had solidified
into ideologies on a national and inter-
national scale, assumed the forms of
parties and States. There was the tre-
mendous fact of Soviet Russia; a de-
cisive one for Cornford; to Wells, the
Webbs, and Shaw a social experiment,
and to Julian, with his modest private
income and his love affairs, about as
relevant as Atlantis.
But at home poverty of a kind not
known for a hundred years was every-
where, and before its human manifes-
tations the old sceptical detachment
beca,me an indecency. It was so vast,
its implications for all so far-reaching,
that it imposed a new consciousness on
the artist, yet at the same time politics
became even more confusing than they
had been. It was necessary to face that
Fascism, grown strong, could be
stopped only by war and Leonard
Woolf went on record that war, any war,
was a greater evil than Fascism. This is,
of course, a crude oversimplification,
but Bloomsbury (a very meaningful,
concrete concept for Julian Bell) was
afraid of what war might do to the
human spirit, afraid of what would be-
come of the outriding elites. Then
came Spain, and it seemed to be a
different kind of war, one in which
identity would not be lost but won,
opening a “clean” passage into the
people’s camp. We may say that it is
significant that few of the British poets
and intellectuals who had first-hand ex-
perience of World War I could bring
themselves to be active for Spain, con-
trary to what was the case on the Con-
tinent. Though, technically, their Spain
poetry was anti-romantic, its innermost
spirit was not, and for many of the
young writers of the ’thirties Spain
offered an essentially romantic solution.
But they soon discovered that they were
not really living in a romantic age and,
in one form or another, organised their
retreat. What saved them from them-
selves and for “Bloomsbury” was not
only the murkiness of history but the
end of the Depression . . . the armament
boom, if we want to be cynical.
This book is an excellent double-
biography. It says much for the skill
and open-mindedness of the American
authors that Cornford and Bell emerge
with equal clarity in all their complex
relationships. They have brought tre-
mendous patience and intuition to their
task. But they have failed to make the
wider social background come to life.
There is something lacking: the grey
misery of England in those years, which
seeped into the bones of her clerks, her
students, and her writers; her rebels and
her revolutionaries.


A Devil with Words
By R. M. WILDING
Of the Farm. John Updike. Andre
Deutsch. $2.
Assorted Prose. John Updike. Andre
Deutsch. $3.15.
OF THE FARM” has an epigraph
from Sartre which tells you the
book is about freedom, and sug-
gests that the concerns will be serious
ones. Philosophical, too, perhaps. The
story itself, though, is very simple. Joey
Robinson, in his thirties, is visiting his
widowed mother on the family farm.
He is taking his second wife and the
child of her first marriage to meet his
mother. The wife, Peggy, has met his
mother only once - they have not
been married long; nor has Joey’s
mother been widowed long. Things have
been changing recently.
The action takes place over a single
weekend a weekend that will mark
a farther significant change in the life
of the characters. Mrs. Robinson is old,
ailing, has some sort of heart attack
on the Sunday afternoon, indeed. She
is still alive when the book ends
but the ending makes it clear she will
soon die. “Joey,” she said, “when you
sell my farm, don’t sell it cheap. Get
a good price.” And here is the concern
of the novel; Joey does not want to
keep the farm, Joey wants to sell it.
But for Mrs. Robinson it represents a
sort of Tradition and Life and all other
capitalisable Values.
The farm, then, becomes something
like a symbol arid the whole book
is a much more pretentious and far less
substantial, far less intelligent
“Howard’s End.” It would be unfair
to imply criticism by citing progenitors
in a form as traditional as the pastoral,
though. The criticism that needs to be
made is that Updike seems to be pre-
tending that he isn’t writing a pastoral.
The farm has never been used to
grow anything; Joey has gone down on
this weekend to mow the fields because
if they are not mown twice a year the
land can be taken away from its in-
efficient farmers. By this Updike would
seem to be suggesting that “Of the
Farm” is far more subtle than one of
those back-to-the-earth, smell-of-new-
tilled-soil novels. It is a subtlety that in
fact merely sentimentalises the farm;
you have the smell of new-mown hay
for nostalgia, and then you counter
accusations of fabricating a close-to-the-
natural-rhythms myth by saying that it
isn’t productive hay. Similarly, Joey is
incompetent on the tractor and does
not even finish mowing the field. But
we still have a lyricism of the Shake-
spearian catalogue of flowers; and, as
a bonus, one of those disenchanted,
sick, and no doubt meaningful gro-
tesqueries of contemporary American
prose stylists; “butterflies loped through
their tumbling universe and bobbed
above the flattened grass as the hands
of a mute concubine would examine,
flutteringly, the corpse of her giant
lover.”
There are many such felicities of
style; Updike has a reputation as a prose
stylist. And so he lyricises the mundane
into exotic epiphanies. “The little
spheres, waxy green, pressed by their
own fat fullness toward the shape of
cubes in the pod, let go serially under
my thumb and tumbled as a crowd into
my palm.” That was shelling peas, that
was.
But it is interesting to notice how he
gets his effects; he aims for a richness
of sensation by a combination of evoca-
tion and quasi-scientific accuracy of ter-
minology. The book is studded with
words and phrases like post-catarac-
tomy, constellated, pentagonal, para-
bolic gear ratios, sequentially, my
chemical condition, piscine, emphy-
sema, continuum; the attempt is partly
to create a factitious richness by poly-
syllabolism, partly to suggest that the
lyricism and what have you is firmly
grounded in scientifically observed de-
tail. This is the writing, the writing
tells us, of a precise recorder; and a
devil with words, too. And then, against
this polysyllabolism, is jarred the abrupt
simplicity of the pastoral setting
flowers, sun, kitchen implements of
menstruation, and of emancipated four-
letter-worded sex.
The language draws attention to
itself partly because it is so often
ridiculously pretentious; Peggy doesn’t
only have wide hips, she has also “a
pelvic amplitude.” When Joey notices
seed burrs caught on his trouser cuffs
Elijah’s Ravens
For Elizabeth Bowen
You soon enough find out. Grief brings you low:
nerves snap; there’s breakdown of propriety;
disdain’s patrician privileges go;
finesse and pride become disorderly,
and bolt before “A bas les aristos!”
You know your fate too well when, scenting kill,
the ravens swing towards your dazzling doom:
such ones as cancer, car-smash, carnage thrill,
who to the spot marked X, the death-bed room,
dive headlong with a charnel-house good will.
They sniff the fissured mould, the split defence,
the victim struck declasse and distraught, .
bedaubed with common tears, bereft of sense,
and closer press —> ignoble, trite, unsought
with cliche pity, crude benevolence.
These friends-in-need you elsewhere would not dare
to show your fine-drawn fancies nor expect
your high aesthetic ecstasies to share,
now that you cannot cavil or reject,
manhandle you with wise and vulgar care.
You soon enough find out. No need to guess:
Grieve and the world grieves with you! here herds stop;
the level of their human clumsiness
below the world’s low level cannot drop . . .
yet this ground-floor’s where sorrow’s shame grows less.
Here only and as focus of the rout
you loathe more than you loathe your misery,
hub of a proletarian roundabout,
your private pain a public property
can grief find cure and peace you soon find out.
HAL PORTER


we shift from Latinity to the sonorous
simplicity of the Bible “I looked
down and saw that nature had also
used me; the cuffs of my trousers were
also seed-bearing.” The pretentiousness
here, of course, is not just linguistic
but thematic. The language is false be-
cause the thought is, too.
But the language catches our atten-
tion because there is so little else in
the book. The relationships are not so
much sensitive as sketchy. Joey’s mother
resented his first wife and she likes
Peggy -as little, or perhaps less. So every-
one becomes tense and begins to quarrel
and personal feelings interplay; so do
memories the book reaches back
into the past. Joey remembers his first
wife, his childhood and student days,
his affair with Peggy before they
married. This does expand the scope
of the book a little beyond the farm.
The trouble is that the relationships
between mother, man, and wife are
neither new nor interesting. The images
of pastoral are long ago exhausted, and
the domestic situation put among that
is similarly barren. The fact that at the
end of the book Joey is as indecisive
as at the beginning, that no satisfactory
resolution has been produced, does not
make the book an interesting variant of
its sort. It may be truer to life, but
it is also less interesting to read.
Updike’s stylistic endeavors serve only
to draw attention to the utter banality
of the novel. There is a clash of feeling
between Peggy and Mrs. Robinson as to
whether Peggy’s 11-year-old son should
be allowed to drive the tractor; and the
banality comes not so much from the
sheer triviality -of the issue as from the
cliche of having so trivial an issue used
to provoke and present clashes of per-
sonality; it is no longer a subtle ban-
ality.
Richard, Peggy’s son, is perhaps the
most cliched of all the ingredients of
the novel; he is another old 11-year-
old saying such acute things, reading
science-fiction,, and holding conversa-
tions about relativity. And he is a
cardboard figure whose cliched attri-
butes are not important to the themes
of the novel; other aspects of him are
relevant —he forms a sort of attach-
ment to his grandmother in looking at
the flora and fauna. But the cute-kid
aspect seems to have slipped in from
the wrong make-your-own-novel kit.
Nature, sex, religion, and fine writing:
the ingredients are all there and handled
in the right sophisticated way. Updike
certainly seems to be claiming to be
saying something, to be an important
writer. The blurb writer calls “Of The
Farm” a masterpiece. Yet it seems
almost as obviously a manufactured
book as his collection of snippets thrown
together in “Assorted Prose.” Yet he
hardly does say anything; he exercises
a few stock sensitivities, situations, feel-
ings; and the gaping interstices suggest
the nuances and subtleties.
“Assorted Prose” is nearly half full
of collected book reviews; the care with
which even the smallest—some are only
a paragraph long—have been preserved
suggests that somebody loves them. But
they are neither better nor worse than
most periodical reviewing. The rest of
the book consists of a few memories—
interesting enough magazine pieces,
but with a tendency to overwriting
and emptiness; and ten parodies. Some
of those are hilariously funny—an
interview by a crass journalist of an
aged French painter is one of the fun-
niest pieces of slapstick I’ve read for
some time; and the parody of Eliot’s
criticism is acute—though weakened by
over.doing the Eliotesque absurdities. It,
too, becomes slapstick. Updike is better
at the broad, bold strokes of farce than
at catching sensitivity. Perhaps, after
all, “Of The Farm” is another of his
parodies; that would explain the broad
strokes of Mother’s heart attack and
of the incredible sermon—in full—de-
livered in the local church; it might
explain, too, the storm that ends the
afternoon’s mowing or the plate-
smashing session in the kitchen. But
who, except Updike, is he parodying?
On the Banana-skin
By GEOFFREY LEHMANN
The Ulcerated Milkman. William
Sansom. Hogarth Press. $2.65.
The Orgy. Muriel Rukeyser. Andre
Deutsch. $2.65.
A BUSINESSMAN dealing in
frozen shellfish empties the ink
from his fountain pen at an air-
port because the pen will leak at high
altitudes. Just as he is easing the ink
out, a door opens and a Baltic wind
splatters the ink on to the white dress
of an attractive woman who immedi-
ately abuses him and jabs his suit with
her stick of lipstick. “Life, the bloody
banana-skin,” he muses as he later sits
back in the seat of the aircraft.
This is an attitude which often
appears in this excellent collection of.
short stories by William Sansom. Most
of the characters are very ordinary folk,
fishmongers, a milkman, an electrician,
a group of window-cleaners. Some of
them trip very nastily over the banana-
skin and fall flat on their faces, and
others go for very enjoyable and hair-
raising rides through transitory fantasy
worlds before returning to the greasy
present.
Imagination is, in fact, what sustains
these stories. The short story is a diffi-
cult and often unsatisfactory art form.
A novel may rely for its effect on
gradual development, subtlety of char-
acterisation, complexity. A poem may
rely on a tightly knit structure of sounds
and images, so that the reader may ex-
perience the poem sensually without
necessarily understanding it. The short
story, however, depends on the author
successfully expounding a simple but
interesting situation involving only a
few characters in a short space. Too
often the puppet-strings show.
With Mr. Sansom the strings show
vary rarely. I found the endings of
“No Smoking on the Apron” and “Old
Man Alone” unsatisfactory, as though
they had been tacked on. “The Little
Sailor” was the only total failure in the
book for me. But some of the other
stories succeed brilliantly. “Hot and
Cold” is a very memorable story. On a
very hot day two seamy fishmongers
try to imagine intense cold and this
leads to one of them stripping and lying
on his slab like a drunken Bacchus,
while the other surrounds him with
ice slabs and parsley. In “The Ulcerated
Milkman” two ulcer patients lie back
in their beds describing outlandish
feasts. When Mr. Sansom’s characters
embark on their flights they become
animated by a grim, demonic humor.
They rise out of their world of blood
puddings, bean tins, soggy paper,
potato-knives, breakfast-food cartons,
and lathered slime and climb like un-
wieldy Zeppelins to burn briefly in the
dank sky high above the telly aerials
of the Welfare State before flopping
earthwards.
Mr. Sansom’s world is a world I
could not live in for very long, but it is
a particularly vivid world for a short
sojourn and his prose style is quite
excellent. I can do not better than
to quote this delicious opening to the
hilarious piece called “A Putting Up of
Pints”:
“Headless, his shapeless oilskins swad-
dling him like a purple burnous, Patrick
Honan drove his cartload of seaweed
into the town backwards. His white-
eyed donkey going forwards looked as
blind to their direction as was Patrick
up on the cart gazing steadily back-
wards. Both progressed into the wide
grey main street as if traffic and towns-
people hardly existed, which was about
it. Coming in along the spray-blown
coastroad, against the wind blowing a
cold nettle of rain fine as needles, back-
to-front was the only reasonable way
for a man to sit . . .”
Muriel Rukeyser’s “The Orgy” is one
of the most boring and embarrassing
books I have ever read. It is a sort of
cross between a travelogue, a stream-of-
consciousness novel, the Book of Reve-
lations, and an anthropological extrava-
ganza. How this book ever crept into
print is beyond me. The explanation is
perhaps that it has a fine and modish
prose style. The author is a moderately
well-known American poet who was
born in 1913, and she knows how to
fashion a resonant phrase. The book
begins portentously:
“I came to that coast. —
But what kind of a book is this? That
place I did not know, the wildness
turned loose in the crowd looking up
to the goat on his blue tower, that peni-
tential landscape with its sea and its

praying crags, that other mythical
beast—an English analyst practising in
Ireland . .
The book deals with Miss Rukeyser’s
visit to the Puck Fair held at Killorglin,
in Ireland. This turns out to be a sur-
vival of a pagan goat festival and Miss
Rukeyser dutifully receives a quasi-
religious-sexual transfusion of energy
and at the conclusion of the fair exits
rejoicing. Toward the end of the narra-
tive the English analyst declares his
love for Miss Rukeyser and holds her
hand. The events described are only
mildly orgiastic; however, the welter of
superlatives and the repetitiveness of
the prose style amply compensate for
the fact that the narrative does not
live up to its title.
None of the characters described in
the book ever really comes to life. The
narrative method is to take quick slices
of incident and imagery and throw the
lot together without much connective
material. As a result the reader is
jerked about rather like a child on a
pogo stick, trying to follow Miss
Rukeyser in her improbable quest after
goat symbolism through the green land-
scape of Ireland.
The Living Camera
By CHARLES OSBORNE
Scan. Kenneth Allsop. Hodder and
Stoughton. $3.85.
LITERARY critics tend to look
down on literary journalists,
which is rather absurd nowadays
when one considers that the distinc-
tions between them are, to say the least,
somewhat blurred. Fifteen or 20 years
ago there were “serious” reviewers and
“popular” reviewers, and Kenneth All-
sop, then at the beginning of his
career, was often denigrated by the
serious gentlemen of the Press because
of his frankly popular style and
approach. Today the writers present a
more united front to the common
enemy, the television literary-inter-
viewer; and having gone into television,
Kenneth Allsop again finds himself on
the wrong end of the stick. It’s not a
stick I ever used with much enthusiasm
myself, and after sharing a BBC pro-
gram with Allsop for two months earlier
this year, I shan’t even touch the
wretched stick again. There are all too
few literary journalists of Allsop’s quick
intelligence employed in broadcasting
or television. Given the circumstances,
the alternatives would only be people
like Beverley Nichols or Godfrey Winn.
Kenneth Allsop’s background is pre-
dominantly Fleet Street, “Picture Post,”
“The Evening Standard,” and the
“Daily Mail.” More recently his serious
but amiable, ready-to-be-amused face
has confronted us from the television
screen, most frequently in the BBC’s
“Tonight” and “24 Hours.” But one
ought to remember that he went into
journalism as a result of the success of
a novel he wrote called “Adventure Lit
Their Star,” which was published
about 16 years ago and which won the
John Llewellyn Rhys Memorial Prize.
And over the years Allsop has continued
to produce books. “The Angry Decade”
was an intelligent look at the John
Osborne generation; “The Bootleggers”
was a well-documented account of its
subject; and he is now at work on a
study of the American hobo, about
whom he talks most fascinatingly.
But though he continues as a part-
time author, Allsop obviously now
thinks of himself as primarily a jour-
nalist. Looking back over the past few
years he writes: “Simultaneous with my
glum realisation that I was not going to
be a novelist (anyway, that I would
never write a novel I, objectively, could
admire), the temporariness of jour-
nalism was congealing into permanence.
And not altogether repellently. I began
to develop a relish for it. The jack-o’-
lantern glints of the early allure winked
through the smog of divorce-case cov-
erage.”
He has come to be fascinated by the
sheer technique of television interview-
ing, an area of interest into which I
can’t follow him. Unable to take the
interviewer-interviewee relationship dis-
cussed in the mystical terms in which
St. Exupery spoke of flying, I am in-
clined to take refuge in an unseemly
levity. Nevertheless, having engaged in
several impromptu conversations with
Allsop on the BBC, I can see that,
while it is actually happening, it does
for Allsop transform itself into a curious
empathetic alliance.
“Scan” is a collection of Allsop’s
contributions to such widely dissimilar
journals as “The Spectator,” “Encoun-
ter,” “Harper’s Bazaar,” “New York
Times Book Review,” and the “Evening
Standard.” Understandably, it’s an ex-
tremely uneven book. The good jour-
nalist’s trick of changing his style,
chameleon-like, to suit his audience is
performed stunningly. The longish
paragraph, wider vocabulary, and more
leisured pace of the “Encounter” and
“Twentieth Century” pieces is immedi-
ately distinguishable from the short,
choppy, one-sentence-to-a-paragraph
raciness that Allsop effects for the
“Standard.” Still, beneath the discon-
certing changes of manner, the matter
is well worth serious consideration.
There are three sections, “Conversa-
tions,” “Considerations,” and “Peram-
bulations,” of which the first consists
of slightly disguised interviews, the
second of reflections on a variety of
subjects, and the third of random notes
for what may, in a later volume, turn
out to be a sociological survey. Among
the writers “considered,” Allsop moves
blandly from that reincarnation of
W. C. Fields, known as William Bur-
roughs, to the vicar of all the nannies,
John Betjeman. Allsop places Betjeman
with cunning and ironic accuracy and
finds the right phrase always. Betjeman
“screeches with laughter.” True, he
does. He has also “a giggle that shifts
gear into a groan.” I think Allsop must
have found him both appalling and
endearing. He is more responsive to
Christopher Isherwood, whose charm is
no less boyish than Betjeman’s. A more
intelligent boy, perhaps.
Allsop finds something to interest
him in all the writers he has talked to
professionally; and although it is diffi-
cult to believe that he can take equally
seriously both C. P. Snow and Ten-
nessee Williams, he manages to find
something opposite and unlikely to say
about them. Even about Patience
Strong, who has been “manufacturing
cheery thoughts indefatigably for
years”? Well, yes. “Besides her,” says
Allsop, “Wendy Darling appears a
manic-depressivd.” And he eases a
couple of deliciously vomit-making
remarks out of Miss Strong herself.
Even she, however, has nothing on
Irving Stone, whom Allsop met at his
Beverly Hills mansion. They talked
about Stone’s Michaelangelo novel,
“The Agony and the Ecstasy,” and
the author’s comments reveal him to
be a kind of American Morris West.
The second section of “Scan,” “Con-
siderations,” is wider in range, but less
individual. Teenage girls’ magazines,
Yevtushenko, Tarzan, “Gone With the
Wind,” Elvis Presley, narcotics: Allsop
is willing to produce an opinion on
almost anything, and always an intelli-
gent and perceptive opinion. Only
rarely does he take a chance or pro-
duce a viewpoint that is not eminently
sound and liberal.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Drought Relief
THE rain that last week gave the N.S.W. wheat belt
another lease of life just when things looked at their
gloomiest seems to prove that God really is on the
Treasury’s side. Provided follow-up rains come by next
month, there now seems every chance that farm incomes will
benefit from the quick cash crop that the economic policy-
makers have been relying on to provide an internal liquidity
lift without the need for substantial official action.
But the good rains that spread right across the N.S.W.
western wheat areas and down into the Wimmera do not
lessen the importance of establishing some sort of coherent
drought policy, like that suggested by Professor C. C. Ren-
wick, director of research of the Hunter Valley Research
Association, to a select committee on drought relief of the
N.S.W. Legislative Assembly.
Professor Renwick first advised the appointment of a
Federal agency, preferably the Commonwealth Bureau of
Meteorology as an official “drought watcher.” Drought warn-
ings should be given on the basis of a rainfall deficiency for
the particular area and industry. When an area is gazetted
as one of drought, the State Government should assume
direct control of all public water supplies and regulate the
number of stock in drought-stricken areas. Some could be
sent on agistment, others purchased by the Government at
a controlled rate and guaranteed price for slaughter. Breeding
stock should be removed to better areas by Government-
subsidised transport.
A fodder conservation board could be established, perhaps
in conjunction with the Grain Elevators Board. None of
these suggested measures, apart from water use control,
should be compulsory to the individual, but anyone who
failed to co-operate should not be eligible for post-drought
assistance.
The suggestions sound eminently practical, not least
because of their studied moderation and avoidance of too
grandiose crisis schemes. But Professor Renwick and his
co-workers have also put forward proposals for the longer-
term future. Their plan for water resource development in
the Hunter Valley deserves attention in terms of sensible
regional planning.
There again the emphasis was on moderation: “There is
no virtue in water resource development for its own sake.
Unless development can provide benefits—either tangible or
intangible—which form part of our community objectives,
it is wasteful in terms of the limited capital available for
development.” Action against drought has still to take place
on that basis.
N.Z.'s "Gentle" Squeeze
THE “N.Z. Economist and Taxpayer’s” August issue
poses the question whether the “steady-does-it” credit
squeeze now operating in the Dominion will save the
country from introducing more drastic deflationary measures.
It doesn’t take a view on this, but at any rate the latest
banking figures (for July) show that the banks, at least, are
measuring up to the tasks set them by the authorities, even
if Government expenditure itself continues on its merry
upward course. It is not so much that trading bank lending
has been reduced each month since the seasonal peak asso-
ciated with the peak tax payment period last March, but
rather that the decline of £42.6 million in the March-July
period this year was almost double that of the previous
MEN AND MATTERS
IN THE 1950 s when they headed
rival hire-purchase companies, 65-
year-old lan Jacoby and 58-year-old
Gordon Kennedy were strong business
opponents, , but good friends for all
that. Today, with both of them pre-
jnaturely “retired” from the hire-pur-
chase business that they played such a
major role in building up (Mr. Jacoby
has retired three times!), they have
become business partners. They have
registered a $1 million company, Main-
leasing Pty. Ltd., which will deal in
real estate mainly by buying and leas-
ing hotels.
To a large extent, Mainleasing’s ob-
ject is to provide an outlet for Mr.
Jacoby, who has a remarkable repu-
tation for starting companies from
scratch and building them up to huge
•enterprises.
In 1953 he had retired after 24 years
as managing director of Industrial Ac-
ceptance Corporation, which he had
joined at 25 when he left his job with
shipping company Mcllwraith Mc-
Eacharn in his home town of Perth
and came to Sydney to get into the
finance business. At that time lAC was
a subsidiary of a LT.S. company that
withdrew in the depression, and Jacoby
arranged the $200,000 local capital
needed to take the business over.
When he left lAC, its outstandings
“were $BO million. To keep himself
occupied he started up a small private
“family” com-
pany, Custom
Credit, in a
cramped office in
a lane off Sydney’s
Broadway. In nine
years this had
grown to a com-
pany with out-
standings of $l7O
million.
Gordon Ken-
nedy was also a
strong influence in the rapid growth of
HP in Australia. He started off with
an agricultural bent, doing his school-
ing at Hurlstone Agricultural High
before joining Australian Guarantee
Corporation in 1928.
HE gave his occupation as
“butcher.” He also happened to
be an astute businessman, a
gentlemanly politician, an able sports-
man, and a good soldier.
But Brigadier T. A. J. Playfair, who
died suddenly at 75 last week, was
proud of the meat business that his
grandfather had started, that he had
joined as a 16-year-old lad fresh from
Shore before going to see how the
meat trade was run at London’s Smith-
field markets, and which, after becom-
ing chairman at 35, he had built up
over the next 39 years into a major
force in the meat trade before the

helmsen Agency. And he had a dis-

year. The fall was £B7 million in July itself, leaving
advances £1.7 million lower than a year earlier.
Although Mr. Williams, chairman of the N.Z. Bankers’
Association, said last week that he saw hope in the Govern-
ment’s recent broadening of restraint measures, like our own
trading bankers those in N.Z. have long been complaining
that they are singled out to carry practically the whole
brunt of credit containment. In the past five years G.N.P.
has risen 45 percent, while trading bank lending rose only
22 percent. The bankers point out somewhat bitterly that
“this situation results directly from the credit squeeze being
applied almost exclusively through trading bank advances.”
This view seems to neglect the fact that, for the past
twelve months, what the “Economist and Taxpayer” calls
“gentle persuasion” has been employed by the authorities
to get a range of other institutions, including HP com-
panies, finance houses, life assurance offices, trustee and
trading bank savings banks, to divert a bigger proportion
of their funds otherwise available, say, for credit purposes
into Government securities. The talk is that, apart from the
arrangement mentioned in the Budget for the life offices to
weigh in even more heavily with bond subscriptions, the
other institutions also will face a further year of gentle per-
suasion as from August 31, when the present one runs out.
From Crayfish to Prawns
ON the books 1965-66 will show as a record year for
Western Australian crayfish, which will have earnt
$17.3 million nearly all of it in Yankee dollars.
But for the men aboard the 750 cray boats along the
West coast, it will be remembered more as the end of an
era. For .the record is written by Americans’ willingness to
lift prices 30 percent, and not by the size of the catch
the worst in six seasons, down ten million lb., or 37 percent,
from the 27.5 million lb. of the 1962-63 boom season.
The reason is basic. When things were good, too many
people tried to get in. And when the crays started to thin
out, the trend was exaggerated by trafficking in under-sized
crays. A Royal Commission in 1964 started the remedies
moving; now only the hardened racketeers remain in a trade
that was so widespread and thinly policed it was a joke.
Heavy fines, snap raids, aerial sweeps, deregistrations, road-
blocks all were used to counter the old tricks of the
smuggling business. While the racket is still there, held
up by inflated prices, it is now extremely limited.
Coinciding with the relative decline in crayfishing have
come two extremely important new developments up the
coast at Exmouth, near the U.S. Navy radio base, and at
Shark Bay. Here prawns are being caught in big quantities
for export to Japan and America, earning boats $4OO and
more for a night’s work. By day the same boats are bringing
in tuna by the ton. Britain’s Ross Group, which bought out
the Kailis family’s International Fisheries six years ago, are
right in this, with a 300-ton mother ship up there and a
boat specifically equipped for tuna fishing leaving Fremantle
this week.
If all goes well, and Ross Fisheries managing director
Theo Kailis believes it will, and has persuaded the group
to double their SAI million Australian investment on the
strength of it, prawns will be bigger than crayfish as an
export earner within five years. Eventually tuna could out-
strip them both.
The Meaning of Job
WHAT is a job? According to the Commonwealth
Statistician’s enterprising exploratory survey to find
out (by sampling) the extent of multiple job-holding
in Australia, such people as professional sportsmen and part-
time musicians qualify, but not domestics, odd-job men, and
babysitters, at least for purposes of counting second jobs.
The bulk figures (survey week was in November last year)
show that 146,500 persons in Australia have two jobs. This
is quite interesting and so are the details of hours worked,
sex, employment status, and industry. The value of the
figures as social and economic statistics will increase if the
surveys are made annually for a series of years.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: BHP is lifting steel prices
by an overall average 3f percent; the increases will
vary from $2 to $4.50 a ton for different types of
products and may add direct costs of around s2om.
a year to the economy. Directors plead the recent basic
wage rise and hitherto-absorbed “cost increases over a
wide range of essential materials and services.”
Australia’s visible trade deficit in 1965-66 totalled
$212.6m., against the 1964-65 deficit of $253.2m.
Japanese purchases reached $471.4m., while Britain,
still No. 1 customer, bought goods worth $471.6m.
Japanese imports lie in third position, after Britain and
U.S.A.
For the markets: The previously rather gentle
retreat became more positive on Australian share mar-
kets as most industrial groups were marked back, per-
haps as a result of characteristic pre-Budget jitters.
Leaders mainly suffered with the rest. Base metals did
not- hold up after the first flush of copper-price
enthusiasm. Oils were less heavily traded.
With the index going to a three-year low, London
certainly avoided any semblance of a technical rally.
Tighter credit, July’s trading figures, and Cabinet
changes provided a depressing goad . . . Wall Street
managed a small end-of-week advance, but dealings
remain at very moderate levels.
For companies: Sydney’s Chevron Hotel nearly
found a buyer in R. W. Miller (Holdings), which put
in an unconditional cash and share offer worth about
$2.9m. The receiver wants to negotiate on a minimum
of $3.2m. and has hopes of bettering the Miller bid.
As a counter to the Martin Corporation takeover,
directors of F. W. Williams first planned to distribute
about three-quarters of the company’s ACI shares to
shareholders; a quickly conceived later plan now allows
full distribution. The full scheme calls for liquidation
of F. W. Williams and formation of a FWW Industries
Ltd. . . . Foiled by the Reserve Bank on its takeover
by the U.K. Transport Development Group, Thomas
Nationwide Transport (TNT) has arranged to acquire
some of TDG’s Australian assets, thereby giving TDG
a 32.1 percent equity interest.
Prosperity among coal producers (see the article on
page 73) is evidenced by Coal and Allied Industries,
which proposes a one-for-one bonus and a dividend
equivalent to 14 percent on pre-bonus capital; 10 per-
cent has been paid since 1960.
By capturing more of the cigarette market, Philip
Morris (Australia) pushed profit up by 40 percent to
$2,017,568 (earning rate 59.3 percent) and confirmed
a 12 percent dividend rate following the previous
year’s 11 percent . . . Also flourishing a 40 percent
profit advance, from $1,071,128 to $1,503,196, Union Car-
bide brought its dividend from 10 to 12 percent; a 10 per-
cent rate had prevailed for 12 years.
The miners, nowadays, are never far behind . . .
Tableland Tin is paying 70 cents a $2 share (for 1964-65
it was 60 cents) on profit leaping from $397,850 to
$481,057, equal to 139 cents a share . . . Particularly
high nickel values continue to be found by Western,
Mining Corporation at the Kambalda (W.A.) field . . .
The 60 percent subsidiary of Consolidated Gold Fields
(Aust.), Commonwealth Mining Investments, earned a
record $938,790, shifting dividend from 6.7 to 9 percent
. . . Beach sand miner Wyong Minerals, also a Gold
Fields subsidiary, increased earnings 52.3 percent to
$367,082 and dividend from 13.33 to 18 percent.
Financiers were kept well to the fore by Adelaide-based
Finance Corporation of Australia, whose profits advanced
19 percent to $1,226,533 on outstandings up by s6m. to
$74-.6m.; earning rate rose to 18.8 percent on higher

Rationalising Mt. Newman
"Watch it! You don't want to get the name of butter fingers
around here."
A MEETING is scheduled for
Honolulu this week to hammer
out yet another amendment to
the Mt. Whaleback (Mt. Newman)
iron-ore consortium plan. This will
seek an acceptable way to bring about
rationalisation of three of the five iron-
ore development projects originally
planned for the Pilbara region of
Western Australia, on the continent’s
north-western shoulder. Negotiations
under the original terms have come to
a halt with the Japanese because a
number of points have proved not fully
acceptable, such as specifications of the
ore under the proposed contracts,
claims over the adequacy of Port Hed-
land harbor, and the latest is said to
be the extent of the Mt. Whaleback
deposit.
Need for a new plan came to light
in April when costs in the region rose
too high for the Colonial Sugar Re-
finery taste. Either their partner,
American Metal Climax, had to take
over about two-thirds of the equity on
a clearly less economic proposition or
another plan had to be prepared. The
answer was to bring in from their ad-
jacent Robe River leases BHP and the
Cliffs Western Australian consortium
(Cleveland Cliffs of Ohio, Mitsui, and
W.A.’s Garrick Agnew) to share the
Mt. Whaleback-Port Hedland develop-
ment with the Mt. Newman group, the
Amax-CSR consortium, so restoring its
economic viability. But there has been
a great deal of trouble in coming to a
woi'kable arrangement.
If it will take weeks to reach a bar-
gain, it could be years before all the
facts of the horse-trading involved
come to light. For example, the Japan-
ese (no friends of BHP, whom they
suspect of engineering the Common-
wealth abrogation of the earlier
Hamersley pellet contract) claim in a

Guide for Cox Bros. Debentures
By CROESUS
OLD Charon, who has had his fair share of obols from Australian shades crossing
the Acheron into the company underworld these last few years, has long
been hoping to get one from the hands of Sir Frank Richardson. With each
liquidity crisis in Cox Bros., these hopes have risen, only to be thwarted by
manoeuvres among Melbourne’s financial establishment to keep the group alive and
kicking.
Croesus has been critical of these
manoeuvres, just as he has been all
along of the far-flung expansion of Cox
Bros, on public money. But like most
other pressmen, I’ve always played ball
with Sir Frank in not giving currency
to the many rumors I’ve heard fro,m
time to time that the group was in
liquidity straits.
The writing has long been on the
wall, but one held strongly to the view
that Australia could ill afford another
crash like Reid Murray and the Kor-
man group with their dire repercus-
sions throughout the trading and
industrial scene. There was always the
chance, anyway, that Sir Frank would
just manage to chew the large chunk
of retail trade he had bitten, and ulti-
mately bring his activities within a
viable financial stiuctuie.
If the basic flaw was over-expansion,
the killers for Cox Bros, were its
interest bill, overheads and marginal
trading. Over-expansion came natur-
ally to a takeover addict like Sir Frank
cutting out bigger slices of imaginary
markets, pie in the sky. In the halcyon
days of 1959 and 1960, the institutions
and the public poured in the necessary
money in debentures, deposits, and
shares. The gearing in the capital
structure looked reasonable enough in
the retail trade setting of 1960, but be-
came unbalanced in the less profitable
and more competitive trading which
has pertained since. Profits dwindled to
the point where it was impossible to
carry such a weighty burden of prior
charges and the equity in the business
virtually disappeared,
When the equity ebbed away and
finally disappeared, it became a battle
to service the prior charges and the
bank overdraft. That battle has been
lost, so enter the receiver, with Ralli
Bros., a British merchant banker, stand-
ing by to get the pickings of a group
which its grey eminence, Sir Isaac
Wolfson, has had his eyes on for years,
I n the round the Ralli Group want
first to restore the equity by cancelling
half th e debentures and the preference
capital, reduce interest payments on and
extend redemption dates of the remain-
ing debentures, and subscribe $2 mil-
lion new equity capital to give Ralli
a 60 percent interest. As matters stand
at the moment this is the best and
only offer before the receiver, failing
other offers being made, will ultimately
have to test debenture holders’ opinion
on what course he should follow. This
pos es the possibility of liquidation. In
that event old Charon will get his tip
to set the company on its way to the
Gates of Persephone,
The liquidation of Cox Bros, may
sound a horrible idea to Sir Frank
Richardson. It probably would to any-
body who’d built up such a mammoth
enterprise, had a million ordinary shares
in it and was the dandy of* the Atheneum
Club and “the Lane.”
But quite apart from the rights of
the particular debenture holders who
stand to be robbed by the Ralli pro-
posals to avert liquidation, as a last-
ditch stand to restore the true color ol
secured debentures in the Australian
finance spectrum the trustee has a cleai
duty to recommend a winding-up. He
has been non-committal in his public
attitudes since the “merciful deliver-
ance” proposals were put up; so, in
case he is vascillating, no time should
be lost by the debenture holders in
organising themselves to demand their
full pound of flesh.
On the narrow question of what Cox
Bros, debenture holders themselves
should opt for, the relative benefits are
admittedly not easy to assess. One can
only guess at the ultimate return of
capital to debenture holders from a
realisation of Cox Bros, assets, but
under the Ralli Bros, proposals they
will, at least, get only half their money
back and then only after a wait of
about sixteen years, with sharply
reduced interest payments in the
interim.
Q.OING on the Reid Murray experi-
ence (debenture holders are ex-
pected to get back about >75 percent),
it looks as if they would do very much
better than that under liquidation, pro-
viding the receiver worked with the
same sort of energy and acumen as the
liquidators of Reid Murray. Moreover,
there are very many more viable trad-
ing components in Cox Bros, than there
were in Reid Murray when the receiver
Jook over. Freed of the obligations to
pay debenture interest and pre-August,
1966, unsecured creditors, a liquidator
for Cox Bros, should be able to ripen
up a pretty good basket of fruit for
ultimate sale to add to such plums as
Georges, which would be nice eating in
its present condition.
So this is the time for Cox Bros, de-
benture holders to call the Ralli bluff,
not to be swayed by sentiment or slop
from the board, by the pretensions of
generosity from the Bank of England,
or by Sir Frank’s eulogies on his deli-
verers. They should not consider the
plight of the unsecured creditors, whose
rights the Ralli proposals have given
precedence over their own simply to
assure the survival of the group as a
going concern.
Nor should they worry about the
ordinary shareholders, for whom the
Ralli proposals provide a platform (a
pretty low one, in fact, because of the
90 percent write down of the ordinary
paid capital) for a reculer pour mieux
sauter operation in which they can
climb into a possible profits’ future
with Ralli (whose 60 percent share of
the profits will be obtained for a mere
$2 million stake as against present paid
up ordinary capital of $l3 million).

Gas Delays
THE only interests seemingly happy
over the protracted delay in
finalising arrangements for the
distribution of the natural gas in Bass
Strait would appear to be the oil com-
panies, who are currently providing the
major share of Victoria’s gas supplies
from the products of their refineries.
The longer the dispute over the price
to be paid Esso-BHP for the gas, the
happier they will be. When Bass Strait
gas starts to flow into consumption
they will have to look to alternative
outlets for various products.
As natural gas has such a heavy
political content in Victoria, I gather
Sir Henry Bolte is not all that discon-
tented to find on return from his three-
month overseas tour last week that
the question of what price will be paid
by the eventual distributor (still un-
decided) of the gas was still not settled.
Sir Henry will get around to this when
it suits him, and he parried questioners
by mooting the possibility of an arbi-
trator being called in.
In the meantime, preparations for
the reticulation and use of natural gas
are proceeding on several fronts. Esso
has called for preliminary tenders for
the under-sea pipeline to bring the gas
to the coast and work is scheduled to
begin in a month or so on the first
stage of a gas ring main in Melbourne
to cater for the increased usage of gas
expected this will run from Dande-
nong to Doncaster. When in Gippsland
recently on the RAS-Shell journalists’
tour, the surveyed route by which the
gas will be piped from the coast was
shown to me and I was told Esso had
bought a substantial area of land at
Sale for envisaged gas-using projects,
such as, say, fertilisers.
THE common denominator of fish
and natural gas in Victoria is
that there’s plenty of both jpff-
shore at Lakes Entrance. As for the
fish, it was quite clear from an open
forum on eastern (Victorian) develop-
ment I attended at the Lakes recently
that active steps are in train to improve
arrangements to get more of them to
Melbourne’s markets. The local Fish-
ing Co-operative has come out of its
shell and, on a conservative estimate,
its spokesman, Mr. McGrath, informs
me foreshadowed production and
marketing improvements could well
quadruple the present 2500 tons sent
to Melbourne each year. However,
there is one above-water snag. The Co-
operative wants a subsidy from Gov-
ernment quarters and these may be
reluctant to entertain one, what with
the new desire to keep New Zealand
fishermen happy and rival demands on
the Government purse.
The Co-op might do better to look
to the Victorian rather than the Federal
Government for help, that is if Sir
Henry Bolte is as keen on decentralisa-
tion of industry as he claims to be.

The Debate on Double Tax
A CAMPAIGN is mounting against
Australia signing more double-
tax agreements that are aimed at
removing one of the two lots of taxa-
tion imposed on the Australian earn-
ings of foreigners. This campaign, in
which the Labor MHR for Scullin, Mr.
E. W. Peters, is taking a prominent
part, coincides with strong suggestions
that Australia should come to an agree-
ment with Germany (among other
countries), which would mean Australia
abrogating her right to tax the income
of German investors in Australia, since
that income gets taxed in Germany,
anyway.
Whether or not the income of foreign
investors here gets taxed once or twice
is clearly an important consideration
in their making decisions about invest-
ing in Australia. So the campaign
against extending the existing four
agreements to cover other countries
is being linked with the case against
excessive capital imports.
In the recent letter aimed at gather-
ing supporters against the proposed
agreements, Mr. Peters said they were
designed to encourage investors in those
countries to buy Australian real estate
and industries. “Some estimate that
such agreements would double the
returns of overseas investors and would
reduce taxation to Australia by half.
“Neither the Government nor the
people of Australia know the value of
real estate and industrial interests owned
overseas. The Government does not
know the present value of foreign in-
vestments in companies nor does it
know the amounts received for real
estate or the present value of such real
estate in foreign hands.”
A “double-taxation agreement” is a
treaty between sovereign States which
exempts wholly or in part the earn-
ings on capital investments (very rarely
are portfolio earnings included) by
foreigners in the “guest country” if
they are overseas residents. In other
words: the country which receives the
investment forgoes income taxation
from foreign investments in its own
economy; the country which provides
the investment receives benefits from
an “activity” of its money in a foreign
country.
should it be so and not the other
way around? This is a very valid
question and M. C. Kemp has argued
the case for “the other way round”
strongly in an article “Foreign Invest-
ments and the National Advantage”
(Economic Record, March, 1962) on
purely theoretical lines. The fact that
international practice is against Mr.
Kemp does not mean that he is wrong.
Australia has “double-taxation agree-
ments” with Great Britain (1946), the
United States (1953), Canada (1958),
and New Zealand (1959), which
enable Australia to make a concession
in the first three cases, but New
Zealand making it in the fourth. Un-
fortunately, nobody knows what these
concessions mean in dollars and cents.
Any tax advantages out of a “double-
taxation agreement” benefit share-
holders only; the company making the
profits originally still pays company
tax regardless of whether it is foreign-
er locally-owned. Although there is a
way for foreign-owned enterprises to
minimise their Australian tax payments
under certain circumstances by opting
for the Australian 15 percent with-
holding tax in lieu of income tax, this
is quite unrelated to any “double-taxa-
tion agreement.”
The strongest point against double-
taxation agreements is that in time of
stress, when capital is inclined to be
repatriated and less profits are made
and ploughed back, the tax “losses”
hit the guest country ever so much
harder than in the days of high activi-
ties. This danger exists, but can be
arrested by the stroke of a pen.

Beneficiaries from Copper Rise
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
By JASON
APART from the fact that shares
in Mt. Isa and Mt. Lyell, which
stand to benefit so tnuch, ended
up the week at around the same levels
they began at, the most intriguing
feature of the 44 percent rise in the
copper price was its impact on the
fabricator G. E. Crane Ltd.
There are probably sound reasons
why the 25 cent rise in Mt. Isa im-
mediately following the price rise news
was followed by enough selling to force
the price down 21 cents over the next
three days. With much of the sell-
ing coming from Britain, it seemed to
suggest a view that high prices are a
long-term danger to a copper pro-
ducer, because of substitution pressures,
and that, anyway, the LME price
was due for further falls. And then
there was always the prospect of in-
dustrial unrest. It also provided a good
opportunity for profit-takers to get out.
But before very long there is going
to be the same market adage about
Isa as there is about BHP—“they are
always good buying at under five dol-
lars.” Even if the new high price does
not stay too high for too long, Mt. Isa
is on the threshold of such huge profits
that even the most skilled accountants
will not be able to hide too much in
reserves, particularly as the expansion
program of the last few years is about
to bear rich fruit.
Another company that faces a dif-
ficult time convincing its shareholders
that it is not as rich as they think it
should be is G. E. Crane, the copper
and aluminiu,m fabricator.
It is significant that when the chair-
man of the Non-Ferrous Metal Mer-
chants’ Association last week protested
against Mr. Calwell’s attack on mer-
chants for exporting fabricated copper
at such huge profits over the raw copper
price he said, “Merchants do not have
the plant necessary to carry "out such
fabrication for export; this is available
only to the larger manufacturing
firms.” There does seem a prospect of
manufacturers like Cranes having done
fairly well in the copper fabrication
export business in recent times, and
this should be at least partly reflected
in the coming profit.
However, investors buying Cranes on
the prospect of Mr. C. G. Crane retir-
ing from the board this year and hand-
ing out a bonus issue to celebrate his
years with the company may have
another year to wait. In any event,
this is a stock that can always be
bought with safety for the long-term
at prices below 4.80, although the
pressure of potential disposals by large
family shareholders does appear to
have put an effective 5.20 ceiling on
the market for the time being.
THE 50 cent shares in Overseas
Corporation are still lingering
around $1 each and yielding 5.5
percent from dividend, despite its
stronger position in the Alcoa camp
following its Dowell deal and the
handy capital profit it made on end-
ing the share link with the U.K. Mid-
lands Aluminium group.
The book profit on the Midlands
deal is believed to be around $140,000
and it has been chalked up in less than
two years. Over the same period, earn-
ing rate has improved from 18.3 to
22.3 percent to provide double cover
for the 11 percent dividend, which
could well be lifted when 1965-66 re-
sults are announced. They are expected
to reveal a fair-sized profit increase for
the year. Profits were well up in the
first six months of the year and the
trend was expected to continue through
to June 30.
The market may be fearing that the
supply of Overseas Corporation shares
available may increase following the
Midland company’s disposal of its hold-
ing, particularly if a cash issue to
finance its expansion plans were to
follow (as seems possible). The fears
seem unreasonable in view of the com-
pany’s record and potential.
WITH 3000 shareholders up in arms
about it, the Shareholders’ Asso-
ciation now taking action, and
the ABC devoting space to it on Four
Corners, the Concrete Industries
(Monier) Ltd. dispute with the U.S.
Navy over the North West Cape pro-
ject has spread considerably since THE
BULLETIN outlined the affair on June
11. But what are these $4.9 million in
claims that the U.S. Navy has rejected
at the operative level and which are
now the subject of further application to
more senior officers? In fact, the total
amount in the claims is $6-9 million,
but because of overlapping claims and
extensions of time already granted, they
represent a net $4.9 million. However,
further “change order” applications
are now in dispute, and if they are
denied additional claims totalling about
million would be made.
The $6.9 million in Monier claims
against the U.S. Navy is made up of
rejection of Australian steel, $U.5.1.9
million; additional radiographic inspec-
tion U.S. steel slm.; antenna hoist
system changes $3.6m.; pier delays
so.3m.

The Chartist says:
INVESTORS looking for long-term capital growth could now consider JAMES
HARDIE ASBESTOS LTD. This stock has moved in a broad long-term
primary trend channel at an approximate rate of 10 percent appreciation per
annum. The top formation in 1964 was followed by a sharp downward trend,
which took prices to just under the $4.00 level after making adjustments for the
par issue and stock split. A consolidation base pattern has formed since the low
point in March, 1965, and suggests a rise to approximately the $8.50 level
eventually. The volume pattern, which has not been reproduced here, indicates
that the stock is gaining market strength and could be about to commence
a new intermediate uptrend at a higher rate of appreciation than the base 10
percent. However, it is likely that James Hardie could ultimately move to higher
levels and the situation should again be reassessed once the first projection has
been achieved. Last sale price on August 12, 1966, $4.96. The company is discussed
in Behind the Balance Sheets on page 76.

The whole of the steel (some of which
was already delivered at the job site
or in the course of fabrication) was
rejected by the U.S. Navy. Monier say
it is the unanimous opinion of eminent
Australian authorities that the steel
complied with contract specifications.
A formal claim was submitted in
August, 1965.
Radiographic inspection: The con-
tract called for radiographic examina-
tion of 20 percent of certain weldments;
the navy ordered 100 percent radio-
graphic examination in February, 1965,
after fabrication was in process at Beth-
lehem Steel and some of the compon-
ents had been delivered to the site.
Antenna Hoists: The Navy directed
changes in design of the antenna hoist
system, causing delays of 365 days in
delivery. Direct costs of the change
were allowed, but time extension and
overhead expenses of the contractor
and sub-contractor were not granted.
Claim made August, 1965.
Pier: Freight costs were estimated
in the contract on the availability of
the pier. Because of a number of
changes in design of the pier, directed
by the Navy, its completion was delayed
and considerable extra freight costs
were incurred in the shipment of more
than 10,000 tons of material and equip-
ment. Claim submitted August, 1965.
THE rights to Bell Bryant’s planned
two-for-five par issue could well
provide a cheap entry into this
growing and well-entrenched supplier
of machinery to the ever-expanding
food industry. At current 4 prices of
$1.07, the theoretical rights price is
about 40 cents, giving a total entry cost
of 90 cents a share. However, because
the shares are quietly traded and the
issue is such a large one, selling pres-
sure could bring the rights down and
provide a very cheap entry.
Even at 90 cents the dividend yield
would be an attractive 5.5 percent from
the 10 percent which is currently being
paid on the existing shares. There is
little doubt that this rate will be main-
tained earnings in the year to
December 31 last covered the dividend
requirement more than two-and-a-half
times.
The major shareholders in the com-
pany are taking up their full entitle-
ments. They are the U.K.-based APV
Ltd., which holds 20 percent, and the
founder shareholders of the two com-
panies which merged to form the group,
James Bell of Melbourne and Bryant
Bros, of Sydney.
Speculators should keep tabs
on the movements in CUB “Z”
shares. So should the investor
seeking a cheap entry into Victoria’s
monopoly brewer. The scrip has been
marked down quite heavily over the
past fortnight as rumors of threats to
CUB’s enviable market position grow.
Mr. R. W. Miller is strongly back in
the picture again, this time more as
a seller of Sydney beer than as a
brewer in his own right. The new con-
tender on the scene is British Tobacco
and the rumors are strong that this
St. George will be attacking the dragon
with an opposition brewery.
But we have heard it all before.
And CUB shares have dropped on the
market before, only to rise once the
fears of competition are shelved again
for another few months. Many have
read more meaning into the latest
threats than past ones because CUB
has been furiously buying up more
hotels. One can’t help feeling that the
timing has all been a coincidence and
any connection between the threats and
CUB’s extended control is purely
imaginary.
And assuming that some game group
does decide to give Victorians another
locally brewed beer there is still money
to be made by watching those shares.
The announcement of another brewery
would send them plummeting way be-
low their true value because of psycho-
logical factors. They would eventually
recover once investors realised the folly
of their earlier panic. Anyway, an eye
should be kept out for any small turn
upward in the market price; it could
herald a return toward the $5 mark
which the scrip was gradually climb-
ing to before the latest round of
rumours.
Penfolds Breaks South Australian Links

now well and truly consider their home.
The Penfold family made the first
break with South Australia long before
the war, when the late Mr. Frank
Penfold Hyland, grandson of Dr. Raw-

and father of the present managing

most important consideration when two
of Penfolds’ main competitors, Linde-
mans and McWilliams, depend so
heavily on N.S.W. grapes.
But last week the break with S.A.,
where Dr. Rawson Penfold began grow-
ing grapes in 1844 at The Grange (“to
make wine for medicinal purposes for
his patients”), became even wider when
Penfolds decided to concentrate its
$| million vineyard and winery expan-
sion program (its biggest in more than
50 years) entirely on N.S.W. by ex-
panding the Griffith winery to enable
it to process far more grapes from
N.S.W. growers, and, more important,
by buying a further 550 acres at
Wybong, near Muswellbrook, in the
Upper Hunter Valley, adjoining the
723 acres it is already developing as a
new vineyard. This will lift its total
N.S.W. acreage to almost 1400 (only
about 150 acres less than its traditional
S.A. holdings). Within seven years, two-
thirds of the 1273-acre Wybong area
should be fully productive at a rate of
about 660 gallons per acre.
THIS new area, 80 miles up the Hun-
ter, will not completely end Pen-
folds’ half a century in the Dalwood
area, where it will keep growing its
white table-wine grapes on the 110 acres
of HVD and Penfold Vale vineyards.
But Penfolds had long since ceased
making wine from the original Dalwood
vineyard it had bought in the early
1900 s, and which had been established
on the banks of the Hunter in 1840 by
Wyndham, although some of the cen-
tury-old hermitage (or shiraz) vines
were still bearing fruit a few years ago,
despite the ravages of time and floods.
With Dalwood, Penfolds also bought
Wyndham’s winery at Branxton, but
this, too, is now ending its life and its
plant is being moved to Wybong to
handle next January’s vintage.
At Wybong, the company has planted
hermitage grapes and is also develop-
ing a dozen continental grape varieties
in the traminer and cabernet styles new
to Australia from vines which have
“miraculously” survived the three-year
quarantine period growing at the wind-
swept North Head quarantine station
in Sydney. The first Wybong bottles
have already won prizes and are avail-
able commercially.
For wine drinkers there is an im-
portant bonus; Penfolds’ managing
director, Jeffrey Penfold Hyland,
thinks that Wybong is going to bring
an improvement in quality for much
of the company’s table wine range.
Mr. Penfold Hyland is not the only
descendant of Dr. Penfold on the board
of what is still very much a family con-
trolled company; his cousin, Mrs. Rada
Penfold Russell, is also a director, main-
taining a tradition of strong female in-
fluence on the decisions of the com-
pany so strikingly set by her mother,
Mrs. Gladys Penfold Hyland, under
whose matriarchal control for the
decade after her husband’s death in
1948 the Penfold company developed
at a rapid pace.

Ambitious Aluminium Plans
THE dangers of overexpansion in
the world aluminium industry were
underlined by three recent an-
nouncements.
First was an ambitious smelter pro-
ject by a newcomer to the industry in
the U.S. Northwest Aluminium Co. is
to spend SU.S.IOO million on a plant
with eventual capacity of 140,000 tons
a year. Production is scheduled for 1970.
The company will become the tenth
aluminium metal producer in the U.S.
World capacity and consumption of
the metal are now in approximate
balance, with some shortage, especially
in the West. But most projections indi-
cate a return to surplus capacity next
year or 1968.
Even established producers have
shown that they can overestimate the
scope for growth profit recovery is
not yet complete after the “third round
of expansion” of the early 19505. Else-
where in the industry bauxite (the
ore) and alumina (semi-processed)
there is no shortage at present; for
bauxite there is not likely to be in the
future because of the relative ease of
developing open-cut deposits.
Demonstrating the pressures in the
alumina market were the two other an-
nouncements the first, about a giant
plant to be built in Jamaica; the second
of the possibility of a lift in the size
of Queensland Alumina’s nearly com-
pleted project.
In two-and-a-half years’ time, the
Jamaican plant is expected to be pro-
ducing 875,000 tons a year of alumina.
It will ultimately reach 1.3 million tons
a year, more than twice the size of
Queensland’s plant. And the Jamaican
project, incidentally, clears the way for
Anaconda, a part owner, to extend its
aluminium production.
Because of the importance of low costs
in competing in a well-supplied market
and because large-scale operation cuts
costs, the Jamaica move has caused
some second thoughts at Queensland
Alumina. The managing director of the
company said last week that the
partners in the project Kaiser, Alcan,
Pechiney, and C.R.A. have asked
for an examination of costs involved in
boosting output.
Provisions have been made to take
capacity up to 1.8 million tons in two
phases, if desired. The original target
of the project was 360,000 tons, but
Pechiney’s decision to join led to a
240,000-ton lift, even before construc-
tion started
The participants in the project have
agreed to take the 600,000 tons output
in the ratios: Alcan 20 percent, Pechiney
20 percent; Kaiser 44 percent; Com-
alco (Kaiser and C.R.A.) 16 percent.
(At present only Comalco’s share is
to be used locally, with Alcan’s planned
Kurri smelter eventually to use a further
tonnage.)
In turn, all bauxite used will come
from Comalco’s Weipa deposits (for 10
years at least in Alcan’s case). However,
most aluminium producers have similar
arrangements in similar alumina projects
throughout the world, and if over-
supply comes something obviously has
to give.
New Nickel Process
ANEW process currently being
studied adds to the chances for
developing International Nickel’s
deposits of nickel ore in the Blackstone
Ranges, W.A. Le Nickel, the French-
owned New Caledonian mine, and
Sherrit Gordon, of Canada, are to build
a pilot plant to determine the econ-
omic feasibility of a new laboratory-
tested process for extracting nickel.
Until now it has been impossible
to extract nickel at competitive prices
from “laterite” ore. It is hoped the
new process will achieve this, especially
with world demand rising. Le Nickel
possesses great quantities of this type of
ore at New Caledonia.
Little is known about the Blackstone
deposit, held by Inco and local interests
including Gold and Minerals Explora-
tion NL, but a recent announcement
from Inco says a sample of laterite
mineral has been shipped to Canada
for study.
Zambia Payments
ALTHOUGH the U.K. Government
has decided officially that British
purchasers of Zambian copper
may not make foreign exchange pay-
ments to Rhodesia for freight charges,
payments will be made. The London
“Financial Times” has reported that
Mr. Harry Oppenheimer, chief of
Anglo American Corporation, the giant
mining house, played a leading part
in arranging a method of getting the
copper moving again.
Anglo American is one of the two
main Zambian copper producers. A
triangular scheme, involving French
and Swiss banking interests as inter-
mediaries, has been evolved to satisfy
all parties, on principle at least.

The Coal Producers Expand
FROM last week’s article on the
prospects of the Australian black
coal industry, it became evident
that producers who sell their output in
three rapidly growing markets the
iron and steel industries, electricity
generation (especially power stations
sited on coalfields), and overseas ex-
ports can confidently expect further
growth in these markets in the fore-
seeable future. By comparison, those
producers supplying declining markets—
the railways, town gas, ships’ bunkers,
and the general industrial market
stand to lose further ground, particu-
larly to petroleum products and prob-
ably also to natural gas in the not-too-
distant future. In the case of overseas
exports, the inherent dangers of over-
reliance on one market, in this case the
Japanese iron and steel industry, should
be fully appreciated.
However, it is not always easy to
determine the extent of dependence of
individual producers on certain markets,
although any information published on
contracts concluded is a valuable guide.
Since New South Wales producers
account for about three-quarters of Aus-
tralia’s black coal production, they are
the obvious first choice for closer
examination.
Statistics released early this month
by the Joint Coal Board clearly demon-
strate the buoyant state of the N.S.W.
coal industry. Expansion during the
1965/66 year was the greatest ever re-
corded. Raw coal production increased
by 3.2 million tons to almost 25 million
tons. Exports overseas rose by over
1.5 million tons to 6.2 million tons.
As far as consumption figures are con-
cerned, electricity generation took 5.7
million tons (1964/65 4.9 million), the
iron and steel industries 6.1 million tons
(5.9 million), metallurgical coke 406,000
(391,000), and food and tobacco manu-
facturers 272,000 (267,500). All other
markets recorded decreased consump-
tion, the most marked being the rail-
ways, which consumed 492,000 tons
compared with 658,000 in 1964/65.
In N.S.W. in 1964/65, “captive
mines” owned by BHP and Australian
Iron and Steel Pty. Ltd., together with
State mines (principally held by the
Electricity Commission), produced over
40 percent of the total State production,
the BHP group alone accounting for
about one quarter of the total with
5.7 million tons. On the basis of present
expansion plans (involving not only the
Newcastle and Port Kembla steelworks
but also the new Whyalla and Kwinana
steelworks), the future demand for coal
for this market is expected to show
further growth.
In 1964/65 the largest of the non-
captive groups was Coal and Allied In-
dustries Ltd., producing nearly 13 per-
cent of the State’s total, its position be-
ing closely challenged by the U.S. Lud-
wig Group, which in 1965 acquired the
coal interests of Placer Development
Ltd. and Conzinc Riotinto of Australia
Ltd.
Coal and Allied operates a number
of highly mechanised collieries in the
Newcastle, Singleton, and Maitland
areas, together with associated facilities.
Most of the company’s production
comes from the first two areas, which
supply soft steaming coals to electric
power stations and the general industrial
market, and soft coking coal to the
Japanese and local steel industries. Pro-
duction from the Maitland field is used
for gas manufacture.
The company has a contract to sup-
ply part of the coal requirements of
the new Vales Point power station (due
to commence service in 1967) and is in
a strong position to supply the Liddell
power station, although contracts for
coal supply have not yet been let. This
station, which is due to commence
operating in 1971, will require some
five million tons of coal per annum.
QN the export side, the company
negotiated a further contract last
year to supply a minimum of three mil-
lion tons of soft coking coal to Japan
over a five year period commencing
1966, at a price of $7.62 f.o.b. per ton.
An additional 300,000 tons (spot sales)
were to be supplied in 1966. It is esti-
mated that, with other commitmenis,
total exports to Japan should be be-
tween 4.5 and 6 million tons over the
next five years.
Production of saleable coal by the
Coal and Allied group rose 680,000 tons
to 2,791,000 tons in 1964/65 and
export sales (including purchases from
other companies and stocks) increased
by 256 percent to 1,013,000 tons.
Although no progressive production or
sales figures are issued by the company,
directors reported last April that group
sales and profits for the six months to
December 31, 1965, exceeded those of
the corresponding period in 1964 and
were regarded as very satisfactory. In
1964/65 group net profit jumped from
$1.75 million to nearly $2.6 million.
In terms of percentage of N.S.W. pro-
duction, three listed companies, R. W.
Miller (Holdings) Ltd., Muswellbrook
Industries Ltd., and The Bellambi Coal
Company Ltd., are more or less on a
par. In 1964/65 these companies each
produced a little under 3 percent of
the State total.
The R. W. Miller group, in addition
to its brewing, hotel, and transport in-
terests, owns or controls nine producing
collieries in the Newcastle-Maitland
district and also acts as distributors for
most other coal producers in northern
N.S.W., including the total domestic
production of Coal and Allied Indus-
tries. The company’s domestic sales are
made to the highly competitive indus-
trial markets. It has, however, con-
cluded a six-year contract, commenc-
ing in 1967, for the supply of three
million tons of soft coking coal to
Japan at an initial price of $8.12 per

ton f.0.b., declining to $7.62 per ton in
1971/72. A new colliery is being opened
for this purpose.
Muswellbrook Industries Ltd. owns
coalmines, including the largest open-
cut mine in the State, and also operates
a power station which supplies power
to the County Council in the Upper
Hunter and Scone area. Other interests
include a brick and tile manufacturing
plant and a larg6 investment portfolio
of unlisted and listed securities. The
market value of the latter at June 30,
1965, was over $2.5 million. It is
estimated that the group, itself, con-
sumes about 20 percent of its own coal
output, the balance being sold to local
markets, principally the railways, with
a. certain percentage being exported.
Although coal sales were increased in
1964/65, increased labor and other
costs resulted in a lower return per
ton. In the current year, the company
has been experiencing a reduction in
sales and profits from its coalmining
activities, principally due to reduced
demand from the railways. The board
has been giving active consideration to
any steps which can be taken to meet
the changing situation in its coalmining
division.
The Bellambi Coal Company Ltd., in
which Consolidated Gold Fields (Aus-
tralia) Pty. Ltd. acquired a 65.6 per-
cent interest in 1964, produces hard
coking coal from the South Bulli
Colliery and owns cokeworks at Wol-
longong, which supply domestic foun-
dries and non-ferrous smelters. The
company is carrying out a major de-
velopment program, commenced in
1961, involving heavy capital expendi-
ture on plant modernisation, installation
of washeries, and improved handling
facilities. The current stage of the pro-
gram, including new face equipment, is
scheduled for completion in the 1966/67
financial year. This program is placing
the company in an advantageous posi-
tion in the overseas export markets.
JN 1961 Bellambi negotiated a two-
year contract in Japan for the sale
of 410,000 tons of coal. This was fol-
lowed by a contract to supply 1.25 mil-
lion tons in the three years to March,
1967. A further contract has been
negotiated with Japanese steel mills,
gas, and chemical companies to com-
mence in April, 1967. This contract
provides for the delivery of 3.8 million
tons over a five-year period at a price
of $9.10 per ton f.o.b.
Domestic sales for coal and coke have
continued at a high level, and the board
has expressed the view that, provided
these remain stable, the latest contract
should ensure the sale of the company’s
entire production in the next six years.
Despite its confidence in the future of
the Japanese markets, the board is
actively developing the possibility of
additional export markets.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Good Augury for James Hardie
THE key figure in the recent
accounts of James Hardie Asbestos
Ltd. is not the 45 percent net
profit jump (it has almost doubled in
the last two years), so much as the
2.2 percent rise in trading profit before
tax and depreciation. In a dreadful
year for the building and motor in-
dustries, where the company’s activities
are centred, even this modest rise is
a remarkable performance that augurs
well for the company as good times
return. Even the ultra-cautious board
agrees that this small increase was
“satisfactory” in view of the economic
climate.
This year the trading profit should
show a marked improvement so that
net profit should continue its growth
despite the exhaustion of the tax losses
the company acquired when it bought
the hulk of the defunct rival Wunder-
lich-Humes asbestos pipe venture in
July, 1964. In addition, the company’s
50 percent increase in listed investments
(now worth ss| million) and its
trebling of unlisted investments to
$662,000 should bring further increases
in the $227,000 investment income
earned last year (about 8 percent of
the group net profit).
In any event, the company expects
another good year in 1966-67 and late
last month the chairman reported that
sales and profits had been maintained
in the first part of the current year
to next March.
More than four-fifths of the $l.l
million net profit rise to $3.6 million
was due to the sharp fall in the tax
bill from $3.1 million (or 55J percent
of pre-tax profit) to only $2.2 million
(or about 40 percent), bringing the tax
charge below the stated net profit for
the first time. These figures suggest
that if the use of the substantial tax
losses reduced the tax charge only 2\
percent below the statutory charge of
percent of profits, then the com-
pany’s taxable income was once again
far higher than it has revealed and that
it apparently depreciates at a far
greater rate than the Tax Commissioner
allows.
There is evidence of the extent of
this in the balance sheet, where the in-
crease in depreciation provisions
against plant and equipment is only
$1.4 million, while the profit and loss
account shows that the board deducted
$3.5 million before arriving at its profit
figure. Another $2.1 million of what
other companies call profit has been
salted away in the accounts, which ap-
parently could have revealed a net
profit of about $5.7m. for a 60 percent
earning rate. About $300,000 of this is
due to the company’s policy of de-
preciating its freehold properties,
shown in the books at a staggering
under-valued $10.3 million, following
last year’s additions of $2.3 million.
But the depreciation charge fell
slightly last year, “due to some older
items of equipment becoming fully de-
preciated.” Shareholders noting that the
plant is already 70 percent written off
are assured by directors that the de-
preciation charge is considered “ade-
quate.” The company’s plant is sub-
ject to heavy wear and tear because
of the abrasive nature of raw materials.
Earning rate leapt from 28.2 to 38.1
percent and earning rate on total funds
continued its steady improvement, this
year to 11.7 percent. Dividend has been
steady at 10 percent for the last decade,
except for a 13£ percent payment in
1964 before the effective bonus that
came in the form of two successive
cash issues, both one-for-four at par,
in July, 1964, and November, 1965,
which financed the development of
manufacturing subsidiaries. The divi-
dend commitment went up from
$840,000 in 1965 to $967,000 in 1966,
and will be $1,050,000 this current,
year, less than one-third of the latest
profit.
noted above, the company has in-
creased its investment portfolio of
listed shares and debentures from s2m.
to s3m. (market value ($5.5m.) and
trebled its share investment in other
companies to $662,000. These latter are
holdings in a Canadian asbestos raw
material supplier, Cassiar Asbestos
Corporation Ltd., and a minority in-
terest in a Malaysian public company,
United Asbestos Cement Ltd., in which
are associated Turner and Newall
again, and the European Eternit group
of asbestos cement companies. James
Hardie is supervising the construction
of the Malaysian building materials fac-
tory, due to commence production this
year, and later a pipe plant, and will
manage both these operations.
Investment in a partnership, with
CSR’s Bradford Insulation Industries,
in thermal insulation, is in the books at
$533,000.
Current assets include a substantial
sum ($2.8m.) in short-term deposits.
Trade debtors and stocks rose from
$6.6m. to s7.lm. and from sB.6m. to
$9.9m. respectively. Overdraft, net of
cash, was extended from $318,000 to
sl.4m. Deferred liabilities of $2.7m. are
insignificant relative to shareholders’
funds of $26.3m.
Shareholders can look forward to
resumption of bonus issues (the last was
a hefty one-for-two in November, 1959).
At current prices around $4.95, market
capitalisation of the business is equal
to 13 years’ profits at the 1966 rate
of earning. The future is not now so
heavily discounted as in years gone by.
With the Chartist (on page 69)
showing that there are good technical
reasons for buying James Hardie, and
with the company’s profits apparently
firmly on an uptrend quite apart from
the benefits of tax losses, the company
has strong investment appeal despite
its immediate dividend return of only
2 percent.

FINE OLD SCOTCH WHISKY
A
SECURITY ANALYSIS
A Consistent Dividend Payer
Pitt, Son and Badgery "reasonably attractive"
THE remaining two companies
which will be considered in this
series are quite small, even com-
pared with Winchcombe Carson. Yet
apart from the question of size they
would seem to perform an almost iden-
tical function and therefore a direct
comparison with other companies in
the group would appear to be quite
valid.
When Pitt, Son and Badgery Ltd.
was first listed on the Sydney Stock
Exchange in 1907, the paid ordinary
capital was $llO,OOO in 100,000 ordin-
ary $2 shares paid to $l.lO. Today the
paid capital is $1,338,586 (including
$15,000 employees’ shares), so over
the past 58 years paid capital has
increased by $1,228,586. This would
seem to be a very substantial increase,
but a dissection shows that of this in-
crease the major part took the
form of bonus issues to shareholders.
Only $39,398 of capital has been issued
to people other than shareholders and
$15,000 of this amount was issued to
employees.
There has been only one cash issue
and this took the form of convertible
notes in 1957. These notes have now
been converted into $332,796 of ordin-
ary capital. The balance of $856,392
represents bonus issues over the years.
From 1909 to 1915 inclusive these issues
were applied to pay up the uncalled
capital of 9s. per share and to make a
20 percent increase in the then fully
paid capital. From 1919 to 1929 inclu-
sive (with the exception of the 1920
year) a bonus issue was made each year.
The result was that a shareholder who
had 100 shares paid to 11s. in 1907 had
290 shares fully paid at 20s. in 1929.
*pHESE years were the “fat” years,
for since that time the company
has issued $386,392 in bonus shares.
Two issues, a one-for-twenty and a one-
for-two, were made in 1950 and the
third and last, a one-for-twenty, was
made in 1957. So, in the twenty-eight
years from 1929, bonus issues made dur-
ing the period represent 133 percent of
the capital at the beginning of the
period, whereas in the twenty-two years
from 1907, bonus issues made during
the period represent 527 percent of the
capital at the beginning of the period.
Since 1957, the record has been a
lean one, for the only shareholder bene-
fits have been increases in the dividend
rate in 1958 and 1959, and since then
nothing.
While Pitt, Son and Badgery does not
disclose details of sales in the same way
as Dalgety and Elders, some informa-
tion has been given in the last three
directors’ reports which enables some
rough figures to be calculated. In the
1963 report, it was stated that “Your
company’s sales of wool during the
1962/63 selling season totalled 157,303
bales at an average price of 60.65 pence
per lb. . . .” In the 1964 report: “Our
sales during the 1963/64 selling season
totalled 171,734 bales at an average
price of 72.37 d. per lb. . . .” In the
chairman’s address for that same year it
was stated that: “Turnover in the stock
and property departments was good and
revenue from this source showed an in-
crease of more than 20 percent.” In the
1965 directors’ report it was stated
that “. . . gross proceeds realised from
wool sold at auction decreased by 16.3
percent,” and in the chairman’s address,
“To some extent, the decrease in earn-
ings from the sale of wool was offset
by improved revenue from livestock and
property sales.’*
From these figures we could deduce
that the sale proceeds of wool sold by
Pitt, Son and Badgery were as follows:
Year to June 30 1963 1964 1965
$ million
23.8 31.0 26.0
Unfortunately, the information on the
revenue from stock and property sales
is not sufficient to produce any similar
figures. All that can be noted is that
in the 1963/4 year a 30 percent increase
in revenue from wool and a 20 percent
increase in the revenue from stock and
property sales produced a 25 percent
increase in profit from trading.
From the point of view of balance-
sheet structure, Pitt, Son and Badgery is
financed mainly by shareholders’ funds
as follows:
per £ of total
liabilities (assets)
Shareholders’ funds 12/11
Secured loans
Bank credit 1/11
Clients accounts, deposits & trade
creditors 3/9
Provisions 1/5
Advances 8c other debtors 11/9
Premises, plant, etc. 6/11
The figures for advances, other debt-
ors, premises, plant, etc., show that
Pitt, Son and Badgery has exactly the
same proportion of total assets invested
in these items as Winchcombe Carson,
but with a rather greater proportion in
premises, plant, etc. As I can find no
indication of any investments in past-
oral properties in the available infor-
mation on the company, it seems that
the whole of this investment is in
assets used’in carrying on the business
of pastoral finance. One might feel then
that the other companies which have
been reviewed are making better use
of the assets at their disposal, but it
will be necessary to examine the return
on assets to make a fair appraisal and
this will be done in the last article.
Currently, Pitt, Son and Badgery’s
ordinary shares are selling at $2.01,
having been as high as $2.50 this year
and as low as $1.88. The interim report
said that profits were down 20 percent
and it might be worth noting that last
year the profit in the first half was down
12 percent and the adjusted profit for
the full year was down nearly 15 per-
cent. In the circumstances, it is per-
haps reasonable to expect that the
1965-66 profit will be down by about
20 percent, which means that the
adjusted earnings will be about 15|
cents per share.
I cannot see that there is any justi-
fication for the current price on the
basis of expected earnings, but the con-
sistent dividend of 13 cents per share
(even though 5 cents is described by
the company as “bonus”) makes the
shares reasonably attractive at $1.88.

The Bills of Exchange Act
No action on recommended changes
THE Federal Government has not
yet taken any action to change
the Bills of Exchange Act along
the lines recommended by a Gov-
ernment-appointed committee more
than two years ago, complains econ-
omist K. F. Shiels. Consequently, the
law governing cheques in Australia in
1966 remains substantially as it was
laid down by British courts in the horse-
and-buggy days of last century.
The story opens in Britain during
the second half of the nineteenth cen-
tury, when the use of cheques began to
spread. The law courts were called
upon to settle disputes that arose re-
garding the rights and liabilities of the
various parties handling cheques. Con-
sequently, there arose a large body of
case law regarding cheques.
In 1882, to clarify and simplify this
case law, which was based on numer-
ous individual decisions, the British
Parliament passed the first Bills of Ex-
change Act codifying the law as it
had been interpreted by the courts.
In 1909 the Australian Bills of Ex-
change Act was enacted. It was copied,
virtually word for word, from the
British Act of 1882. Apart from a few
relatively unimportant amendments,
this Act, based as it is mainly upon
court decisions made in an entirely
different era in another country, still
governs the cheque system in Australia
in 1966.
time dragged on, many writerj in
England and Australian pointed out
that the Bills of Exchange Act was in
need of revision. A vast amount of case
law had been built upon court interpre-
tations of the Act, many of which were
conflicting or confusing or, in some
cases, farcical from a practical point
of view. As a result, the vast majority
of cheque-users did not properly un-
derstand their rights and liabilities and
the legal effects of the different kinds of
crossings and other markings on
cheques. In particular, criticism was
directed at the vast waste of time
caused by the law regarding endorse-
ments. However, no important amend-
ments were made to the Act, either
in Britain or Australia, until 1957, when
the Act was amended in Britain.
In 1957, some action at last in Britain.
As a result of the initiative of a private
member of Parliament named Page, the
British Parliament made important
changes in the law and practice'relat-
ing to the endorsement of cheques. As
a result, the need for endorsements was
abolished for the great majority of
cheques. Furthermore, a serious
anomaly in the law relating to the
liability of collecting banks was re-
moved.
In 1962 there were signs that the
long period of somnolence in Aus-
tralia might be disturbed. The Gov-
ernment announced that “following
recent British legislation” (then nearly
five years old) a committee had been
appointed to recommend possible alter-
ations to the Bills of Exchange Act.
The committee would be asked to give
particular attention to the practice of
requiring endorsement, which many
people considered entailed unnecessary
labor. This statement was read with
interest by persons who had been ex-
pressing this view for some 30 years
or more.
In June, 1964, the Commonwealth
Attorney-General stated that the com-
mittee referred to in the previous para-
graph had made quite far-reaching
recommendations. One of the main
recommendations was one which
would abolish the need for endorse-
ments on the great majority of cheques.
So far no action has been taken to
implement the committee’s recommen-
dations.

MAN ON THE LAND
Holding the Rabbit at Bay
IT doesn’t take the rabbit very long
to hit back in Australia. Many
farmers are all too aware that the
once all-conquering myxomatosis is
losing its potency. The tremendously
high kills of the early 19505, frequently
of the order of 99 percent among
large populations, do not seem to occur
any longer.
Sp, in the continuous battle to hold
the rabbit at bay, recourse is more and
more to the old methods—trapping,
poisoning, gassing, ripping burrows, and
expensive fencing. Nothing as simple
and effective as myxomatosis appears
to be in the offing, either.
Yet at least it can be said that the
scientists are not taking the new situa-
tion lying down. An account of recent
CSIRO activity was given last month
to a gathering of more than 100 wool-
industry representatives, meeting with
the CSIRO Division of Textile
Industry at Geelong. They heard a
comprehensive paper, “Research and
the Rabbit Problem,” from Mr. B. V.
Fennessy, of the Division of Wildlife
Research.
Mr. Fennessy was able to point out
that myxomatosis is still an important
factor in rabbit control. It is, how-
ever, not the main answer, since the
rabbit host has learned to adjust itself
to the myxoma virus.
Two principal reasons are produc-
ing this adjustment. The rabbit popu-
lation itself develops genetic resistance
to the virus and the virus, too, is de-
veloping less lethal strains.
NATURALLY CSIRO is always in-
terested in improved and potent
virus strains. But even their effectiveness
will, in the long run, be diluted by
the weaker strains. At present the
virulent Glenfield strain gives evidence
of the highest efficiency; Victoria, for
instance, injects 14,000 rabbits a year
with it.
There is no doubt, though, that
better control methods must emerge
to supplement myxomatosis. Much
of the work now being done derives
from a closer study of rabbit biology,
embracing the rabbit’s social behaviour,
its food requirements, and its popula-
tion movements.
The method demands the study of
rabbits under more or less natural
conditions, in paddocks varying in size
from two up to as much as 45 acres.
The animals are watched day and
night through binoculars and tele-
scopes, after having been tagged with
dyes and phosphorescent tapes. The
full program is expected to cover
about five years.
Changes in the size of rabbit popu-
lations may also be caused by seasonal
conditions, predators, parasites, and, of
course, myxomatosis, Mr. Fennessy
indicated. One important section of
the research concerns itself with sur-
veying rabbit distribution in relation
to soils and topography. That possesses
a very practical bent: it is necessary
for planning strategic control policies,
particularly in the low rainfall areas
where graziers cannot afford to pay
as much per acre for rabbit control as
graziers in the higher rainfall areas.
The field studies, taking place over
widely separated and well-diversified
areas, are yielding valuable information
on the rabbit’s natural history. They
are showing that rabbits live in small
groups in territorial areas, which are
strongly defended against intruders from
neighboring territories, particularly dur-
ing the breeding season. Such firmly
defined social groups breed, forage, and

roam within clear-cut boundaries, cross-
ing rival frontiers only when breeding
stops. Each social group is led by one
dominant buck.
Investigation has confirmed that
poisoning operations are more effective
if done when rabbits are not breeding,
since any given poison furrow will then
attract a larger, wandering population.
Poisoning once more has become the
main attack against rabbits, mostly with
sodium monofluoroacetate (1080).
The CSIRO enclosure studies are re-
vealing that rabbits from time to time
develop a considerable hunger for salt.
Mr. Fennessy suggests that it may be
possible to exploit variations in appetite
to make poisoning more effective.
A T the same time as the enclosure
tests, the CSIRO is pursuing an in-
tensified study of rabbits in the wild.
Results from this tend to confirm the
basic enclosure findings. Rabbit popula-
tions are being tracked by radio tech-
niques, since their movements play an
important part in the recovery of popu-
lations after control measures have
taken their toll.
Perhaps the practical man will be
most impressed at the beginning if
CSIRO succeeds in working out simpler
poisoning techniques than those used
at present. It is dangerous when many
farmers do not poison regularly,
although they leave themselves open to
prosecution, because the operation is
fairly complicated.
As it stands now, 1080 is usually
mixed with diced carrots and spread
along specially ploughed furrows. But
two or three takes of unpoisoned bait
must be put down to make the rabbits
used to the strange diet. It has been
estimated that about 100,000 miles of
furrows are dug in Australia each year.
A very high killing rate is often
achieved. But an easier process would
obviously be more appealing and
afford no excuses for neglect.
Farmers and graziers should need
little telling that every weakness in the
rabbit has to be exploited to keep the
species within limits. They remember
the dramatic influence of the first years
of myxomatosis on wool and meat pro-
duction. The CSIRO’s detailed studies
are being followed with intense interest.

You Can Taste the Chicken
THIS story, unlike most matters
mentioned in this column, does
not have obvious importance, but
it does contain' a moral. It simply con-
cerns idle talk and consumers’ needs.
People here are beginning to say that
our modernised poultry industry is
offering us chickens to eat which, though
admittedly more tender and cheaper,
are relatively tasteless.
This complaint has been voiced for
some years in the U.S., on whose broiler
industry ours has been fashioned: the
birds are specially bred and fed to
reach marketable weight at a very
early age. Both the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and the University of Ohio
have designed experiments to discover
whether the fault, if any, lies in the
chickens or the people.
They obtained table poultry of a
breed that was popular 30 years ago
and reared the chickens on the kind
of diet generally provided in those days.
When these birds had reached certain
weights they were slaughtered along
with modern, fast-growing chickens
which, though much younger, had also
reached the same weight. Both lots
were cooked in the same manner and
served up, unidentified, to scores of
people who were asked which tasted
better. The result: an even division on
the question of flavor, but a large
majority agreed that today’s chickens
were juicier and easier to chew,
The investigation was taken further,
as it is well-known that people lose
their sensitivity to certain tastes as they
grow older. It could be that sensitivity
to chicken, which has a relatively mild
flavor, declines at an early age. To test
this possibility 80 people were divided
in three age groups (19 to 30 years, 34
to 45, and 49 to 69). Two batches of
broth were made, one from fully mature
old hens and the other from prime
broiler chickens. Each batch was then
diluted to concentrations varying from
pure water to 35 percent broth. Half
of the people in each age group were
given either hen broth or chicken
broth. They had to taste each of the
samples in order of increasing con-
centration and declare when they could
definitely recognise the flavor.
Surprisingly, the old people could
recognise chicken flavor in more dilute
concentrations than the young people,
and the men’s taste for chicken was
consistently more acute than the
women’s. Neither young nor old, male
or female, could distinguish which of
the broths was made from the chicken
broilers and which from the old hens.
More, of course, hangs on this in-
vestigation than the provision of ammu-
nition to settle arguments around the
family dinner table. The U.S. has, over
the past few years, been building valu-
able export markets for its broilers
(and turkeys) in Europe, the Middle
East, and Japan. Idle talk at home
deprecating the quality of the chickens
could leak .abroad and damage a trade
that was not easily established. Ameri-
can agricultural science has always
devoted a large part of its total re-
sources to marketing research and the
development of new products (utilis-
ation research, they call it). This sort
of work is lamentably lacking in Aus-
tralia, with the notable exception of
wool textiles.
B UT back to poultry. The famous
university Cornell has not felt that
prying into breakfast menus is beneath
its dignity. The fact is that on the other
side of the Pacific they, too, have an
egg surplus. While we have been trying
to meet this predicament with subsi-
dies and regulations, the Americans have
been trying to find out why there is
an egg surplus and formulating new egg
products to increase consumption. It
turns out that many Americans no
longer eat eggs for breakfast. The
reason found for this is that they don’t
have enough time in the morning rush
hour to prepare egg dishes apart from
simple boiling, but people can’t face
boiled eggs every morning.
To provide tempting alternatives the
Cornell scientists have developed and
market-tested 16 new products. Several
of these utilise the hen rather than the
egg, because the poultry farmer’s eco-
nomic problem consists not only in
selling eggs but also in disposing of the
old hens at a reasonable price. The new
hen-meat products are described as
loaves which can be eaten cold or
heated in a few minutes and served hot.
So great has been the demand, indeed,
that the price of eggs and hens through-
out New York State has risen already
and poultry farmers are not being
squeezed nearly as tightly as they were
until a few months ago. The Cornell
chappies who pioneered this will never,
to be sure, get their names in the text-
books or be elected as honorary mem-
bers of international scientific societies.
But some farm families will bless them
and many New York taxpayers, replete
on a good and easy breakfast, will
cheerfully continue contributing to their
salaries.

An Exercise with Debentures
Some ironies of secured investment
WITH Cox Brothers’ debenture holders struggling to get out of their invest-
ment and others striving to get into BHP debentures, it seems an appro-
priate time to critically examine debentures as a form of investment. For
this exercise, I made a quick examination of all listed debentures at the beginning
of the ’sixties. Out of a total face value of $330 million listed at that time, the
prospects of the full repayment of $4O million is in doubt.
To reduce this state of affairs to a
more simple level, if an extraordinarily
cautious investor wanted to spread his
investments evenly over the entire listed
debenture market at that time, $l2 in
every $lOO would be in doubt. So, if
people have been disappointed in the
share market since 1960, how much
more disappointed would they have
been in the debenture market! In this
light, secured investment has a some-
what ironical ring.
Ordinary shares also have their
moments of disappointment, whether it
be selling too early or too late Take
Western Mining. For the sake of rais-
ing funds, I sold my Western Mining
last week at $5.08. This week directors
released the news of the very high
nickel assay values. As a result the
market took off again. If I d delayed
my selling decision for just one week,
I d be $l9O better off!
Not to be discouraged by this, I
decided to take a few other profits. First
of all, those Tulloch had such a smart
rise to 60 cents that it was too much
to resist. By selling at an average
price of 58 cents I cleared just on $l2B.
Then, when Philip Morris brought
out its usual spectacular increase in
profits and caused the shares to rise
to $ 7 - 60 , 1 stepped in very quickly with
a selhn g order - A not very startling
Jut nevertheless satisfactory profit of

1 of a u this selling is that
k the account into a ver health
credit With the first purch ase of the
week being Mt. Isa, I needed it.
When Mt L u decided to break
away from the Australian producers’
price for copper last week, the big
question was whether Mt. Isa would
follow , i t took Mt. Isa directors only
a few days to decide in the affirmative.
With this question answered, one then
had to decide how much more than
$4.40 the shares were worth $4.40
being the market figure before the
copper price rise.
As the selling prices of copper now
ruling on the London Metal Exchange
will ensure at least a 100 percent
increase in profits, then a share price
of something over $5 is not unreason-
able. This is after making allowance
for the much publicised fear of sub-
stitutes creeping into some of the tradi-
tional markets for copper.
I was not unpleased with the pur-
chase of 100 Mt. Isa at $4.85 on the
Monday. By Wednesday, however,
when the price had fallen to $4.55, I
was going into a state of shock. I
just had enough presence of mind to
get another 100 shares.
Compare this to the other purchase
of the week, Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie,
which has held rock steady at $1.20.
With Peko Wallsend and Emperor
Gold already in the portfolio, gold is
starting to dominate the list. The next
few months will probably be the most
severe test for sterling so far. I’m
quite sure that sterling will pull
through, but the few anxious moments
in the interim could send gold shares
haywire.
Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie has both
technical and fundamental points in its
favor. An expansion program has re-
versed the downward trend in profits
and, while dividends are still low, there
is a good likelihood of them being
increased within the next year. v .
Transactions for the week were:
BOUGHT
200 Mt. Isa $4.70 $963
400 Gold Mines of
Kalgoorlie $1.20 $492
SOLD
1000 Tulloch 58c $568
100 Philip Morris $7.60 $744
400 TNT $1.30 $509
I just managed to end the week
with a small credit of $lO.

TREPHINING IN ANCIENT PERU—one of a series of oil
paintings. © 1958-59 — Parke , Davis & Company
Great Moments in Medicine
Surgical opening of the skull (trephining) was
common among certain Peruvian peoples about
2000 years ago. Equipped with knives of glass-
hard obsidian and well-honed bronze, Peruvian
practitioners probably were further aided by
crude anesthetics made from native plants.
Nearly 100 years ago, Parke-Davis explorers
were investigating the medicinal plants in
South America that have yielded anesthetics,
muscle relaxants, and other useful drugs. And
only a few years ago, the soils of South America
yielded an organism from which Parke-Davis
research scientists developed one of the most
important of today’s life-saving broad-spectrum
antibiotics.
In this, and in many other ways, Parke-Davis
is helping to make available to the people of
Latin America, and to people the world over,
the better health and longer life that come with
better medicines.

You pour more than 40
'single'whiskies
when you pour one glass of
Johnnie Walker
When you pour yourself a Johnnie
Walker you have more than 40
‘single’ whiskies all in one glass
because it does take that many fine
whiskies to make one Johnnie
Walker. That’s the secret of
Johnnie Walker’s smoothness and
mellowness. And 146 years’ skill in
blending. These different whiskies
come from all over Scotland. Rich,
characterful Glenlivets and
Highland malt whiskies tangy
with the faint taste of smoke from
peat fires. Smooth, rounded Islays.
And clean, fresh-tasting grain
whiskies from the Lowlands. Some
of these whiskies are matured as
long as fifteen years none less
than five. All very smooth. Very
mellow. No wonder Johnnie Walker
is the world’s best-loved Scotch. In
miniatures, 5 oz. and 13 oz. flasks,
13 oz., and. 26 oz. square bottles.
