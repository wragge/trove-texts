IN Tom Tower, situated over die
main gateway to Christ Church
College, Oxford, hangs “Great
Tom,” one of the most famous bells
in all Britain. Every evening at five
minutes past nine one hundred and
one strokes are sounded on this
seven-ton bell which was originally
hung in Osney Abbey, an Augus-
tinian house founded in 1129 in
Osney Town, now a suburb of
Oxford. Each stroke represents a
member of the original college
foundation, and the sounding of the
bell each evening is the signal for
the closing of the gates.
Tom Tower was built by Sir
Christopher Wren in 1682 over the
original gateway to the “Cardinal
College,” founded in 1525 by Cardi-
nal Wolsey on the site of St. Frides-
wide priory. “Cardinal College”
was suppressed in 1546, and Christ
Church, familiarly known as the
“House,” was founded in its place.
It is the largest of the Oxford col-
leges, accommodating about four
hundred undergraduates.
The Oxford colleges and their
Chapels have made Oxford one of
the most beautiful cities in the
world, and there is so much here for
both the sightseer and the student of
history that a visitor might well stay
a week in the town without spend-
ing an idle or a tedious moment.

BYRON'S TERESA.
Teresa, Countess Guiccioli, was the
last, and in some ways the most attractive,
of Byron’s mistresses. She was no blue-
stocking—a breed Byron detested —but
she read poetry, and through her family,
the Gambas, Byron came into contact
with the Carbonari movement.
Austin K. Gray’s Teresa: The Story of
Byron’s Last Mistress (Harrap) deals
fully with the Italian phase of his life—
and this period, it is worth while re-
membering, was important. The fruition
of creation is slow, complex and always
mysterious. Certainly it is not to be
pinned down to mere geography and
dates. But it is nevertheless true that
Byron, in his Venetian tragedies and in
“Sardanapalus,” owes something to
Alfieri; that the great Italian mock-heroic
school from Berni to Casti influenced
both “Beppo” and “Don Juan*; and in
“The Lament of Tasso,” “The Prophecy
of Dante” and “Francesca of Rimini”
there is evidence of more than a mere
complimentary warmth to Italian poetry.
Byron had written “Mazeppa,” “Bep-
po,” and the first canto of “Don Juan”
when he met Teresa, the young wife of
an elderly and unpopular Italian count at
Venice, and after following her to
Ravenna, began the long and complicated
love affair which ended only when Byron
sailed to Greece in circumstances bizarre
enough for Juan himself. Guiccioli had
a reputation not only for double-dealing
—he was a war-profiteer—but for fero-
city ; it was rumored he had killed a priest,
and there was lively anticipation that he
would at least maim Byron. He did, of
course, nothing of the sort, attempting
first to use Byron’s influence to acquire
diplomatic immunity for his property, and
then to borrow money.
Byron did try to get Guiccioli a job
as a minor British official, but regarding
the money, he had been caught by hus-
bands before. He continued to go riding
with Teresa; then, having rather reluct-
antly assumed the conventional position
of her cavaliere servente —an Italian sur-
vival of the courts of love of the middle
ages—was for time resident in Guic-
cioli’s palace, yvhere he was overwhelmed
by Guiccioli’s courtesies; and where,
after their relationship had become irre-
vocably strained, Byron was for a time
left in sole possession, among the ammu-
nition stored by Gamba and his impracti-
car band of ydung revolutionaries.
It is improbable that Teresa was, as
she liked to think, Byron’s Beatrice, his
Laura, his inspiration. And it is worthy
of note that she considered “Don Juan”
“wifked,” and for a time persuaded
Byron to cease work on it. But Byron,
more than most poets, drew directly from
experience, and in a sense Teresa and
Italy were synonymous. Whether, as a
matter of fact, the lovely Haidee of “Don
Juan” was really Teresa, or an idealisa-
tion of Teresa, or whether (as seems very
likely) Byron, when writing of Haidee, at
times had Teresa in mind, is immaterial.
It is to this period that “Don Juan” be-
longs.
Mr. Gray explores this, and kindred
matters, not too happily. But the more
painstaking pieces of research (such as
Lamartine’s Vie de Byron ) are merci-
fully banished to the appendices. It is
Teresa, after all, who is the central char-
acter of the book, and after the over-
whelming shadow of Byron is • removed
by death it is pleasant to discover that
Teresa, for all her devotion, did not pine
away. She tried living with her husband
again, was separated again, but wrote
him cordial, scolding, and wifely letters.
She met Lamartine, and Henry Fox, who
had known Byron as a.child and to whom
she was attracted —principally, the author
maintains, because he was lame—and
after a deal of aimless wandering she
married Hilaire-Octave du Rouille, Mar-
quis de Boissy, and lived happily with
him for 20 years. After their marriage
her husband presented her to the king,
Louis Phillipe, with the memorable
words:
“Madame la Marquise de Boissy, Sire,
my wife and formerly the mistress of Lord
Byron.”
Teresa, the daughter of an impressively
pedigreed but poor and obscure provin-
cial family, had spent her early woman-
hood in a world luxurious with person-
alities: Byron, the Shelleys, that queer
corsair, Trelawney. She had met Hob-
house, who, for all his externals of the
moderate English gentleman—or, per-
haps, because of them —so stamped him-
self on the imagination of Byron; in
Italy the great English aristocrats who
were later to snub her in England were
only too pleased to meet the last of
Byron’s mistresses and there, too, she
knew the Buonaparte family and had met
Louis Napoleon as a sulky youth.
She remained loyal to Byron’s memory
and even wrote a very dull book about
him —Lord Byron Juge par les Temoins
de Sa Vie —in which, incredibly, she suc-
ceeds in making him a kind of middle-
class plaster saint. It is therefore
wholly fitting and just that her last hus-
band, although one of the richest men
in France, should be something more
than a millionaire. He was: Hilaire-
Octave du Rouille, in a glittering period,
was in his own right a “character.”
There is, for instance curiously
reminiscent of the brawl at Pisa (when
Byron, Shelley, Pietro, Trelawney, Captain
Hay and Taafe did battle with Hussars)
—Octave’s conduct during the Revolu-
tion of 1848, which Octave, by his de-
nunciations of fraud, had done as much
as anyone to precipitate. But he was
appalled by the mobs and decided to die
a Royalist. He donned his shabby
National Guard uniform and, calling on
his coachmen and footmen to follow
him, went into the streets:
For two days Teresa searched for his
dead body he returned in the night,
laughing and excited. His face was black,
his eyebrows singed, from head to foot
he was covered in filth and blood not his
own....he had found himself in a crowd,
someone had thrust a gun into his hand —•
then he was standing at a barricade firing
at troops at the end of the street —a dead
man had fallen upon him and knocked
him down—another corpse fell upon him,
and another, and anothdr — then he was
pulled out from under his load of corpses
he stood rocking on his feet, shouting
hoarsely “Vive le Toi!” and, 1 lo! grimy
communists were slapping him on the back
and shaking him by the hand. Ah, in that
moment he had known what it was to be
an aristocrat!
It is this kind of incidental, almost
accidental, writing that makes Teresa, as
a history of a period, interesting. For it
was a great, colorful, exciting length of
time which Teresa encompassed, from
the time she met -Byron till her comfort-
able, even illustrious old age as the widow
of Octave, about the time of the Franco-
Prussian war, reading everything new
that was written and liking Dickens best
of all. '
Of the Byron period there are suffi-
ciently interesting pictures: or rather, re-
minders, since that period is already well
documented. Some scenes are clearly
painted in their own right; Guiccioli
furiously discovering that Byron’s bull-
dogs, Byron’s servants, are monopolising
his palace; then, by an ironic revenge,
Byron discovering that Leigh Hunt’s
children and terrible complaining monster
of a wife are overrunning his. And the
picture of Byron, Shelley and party gal-
loping furiously through the gaping
streets after a red-haired, white-faced
Hussar. And the aftermath;
Without, the town was in an uproar.
Turn the maladetti Inglesi out! some were
crying. No, shouted others, hats off to
brave men! Then came a sobering sight.
Every Englishman in the city from lord
to groom was walking, arrogantly and
sedately, towards the Palazzo Lanfranchi,
with pistol, cane, or riding-crop in his hand.
Lord Byron’s morals might be disgraceful
but, by God, he was an Englishman! He
had been insulted —he was in danger—if
there was to be a row he might command
their services.
At this time there is an ironic, inverted
sort of topicality about reading this —a
reminder of spacious times. And that,
whatever its shortcomings, is the effect
of the book. Hardly a deep historical
study, lacking the pertinence and clarity
of a good biography, it deals with matters
and persons who can hardly be anything
but themselves —personalities. And as
such, fascinating.
"Beware the Cuckoo."
Professor Ernest G. Moll’s title poem in
Beware the Cuckoo (Australasian Pub-
lishing Co.) clearly indicates the strength
and weakness of the book as a whole, its
attraction as landscape poetry, its disso-
lution into a complaint against the cruelty
of the universe. The essence of the poem
is:—
This poem in itself would hardly call
for critical attention other than admiring.
Cruelty, does exist in the universe, it is
repellent to the civilised conscience, and
any poet must be entitled to speak his
mind about it from time to time.
But Professor Moll speaks his mind
about it all the time. Or, at least, to
such an extent that the complaint is the
keynote of his book.
The cuckoo is on page nine; on page
ten Professor Moll is complaining about
a tractor’s cruelty to a draught-horse ; on
page 17 he observes the cruelty of a
praying-mantis to a fly; on page 19 he
is feeling grim about what happens to
turkeys on market-day; on page 20 the
victims are rabbits; on page 23 a
butcher-bird is doing dire things to a pet
rosella, and “it helps no one at all” that
somebody, in revenge, shoots the butcher-
bird ; on page 29 a grader is being cruel
to a roadman; on page 35 a bullfrog
is cruelly eating butterflies; on page 37
a sheep-dog slays 50 lambs; on page 41
the poet says he has been cruel to a
tree ; on page 61 .a schoolmaster is being
cruel to a pupil and dew-plants are being
cruel to insects ; on page 68 a farmer is
being cruel to his sheep; on page 73 a
farmer cruelly has an old horse de-
stroyed ; on page 75 a spider is cruel to
a fly ; and, throughout the book, mingled
with these objections to the cruelty of
nature, there are, deepening the under-
lying melancholy, attacks on war, re-
grets for the passing of time, laments,
elegies and sombre notes on undertakers.
One sees Professor Moll, in many of
the poems, resisting'this theme of com-
plaint. The tone in which he speaks is
humorous throughout—on the surface —
and sometimes, as in the poem about the
shooting of the horse, the final effect,
were it not qualified by the general drift
of the book, would simply be of grim
comedy; an acceptance, even an affirma-
tion, of life’s cruelty. In “Thistles in
Winter” the lament for flowers destroyed
by the “hag Winter” changes to a mood
of defiance and challenge, making the
suggestion, as has been done earlier at
the end of the rabbit poem, that cruelty,
hopelessness and unrelieved misery are
not the final or not the only truth about
the universe:
But the thistles, stem on stem,
Have nothing she can take from them;
Long ago their veins went dry
And they laugh as the hag goes by.
But these variations, modifications and
contradictions are not strong enough to
alter the book’s total effect. Professor
Moll gives one the feeling that one should
be “up and doftig” about the cruelty of
things ; that one should instantly form
societies for the protection of butterflies
from toads; and this, though doubtless
an admirable state of mind, is not quite
a poetic one.
“The final effect of true art,” said
Goethe, “is the feeling of charm” ; and
again, “The tremor of awe is the best in
man.” Professor Moll leaves one, on
the whole, neither charmed nor awed with
his poetry but, since one really cannot do
anything about spiders and flies, a little
exasperated ; with the feeling that he is
not being quite fair; that his complaints
should be addressed not to readers of
Beware the Cuckoo but to the Divinity
who created the cuckoo, or the Devil
who led it into evil ways.
And sometimes, indeed. Professor Moll
does address his complaints Elsewhere;
to some ultimate evil or duality, the
major force behind all minor cruelties..
But he does not do this in a big, in a
bold, in a wild and dramatic and blas-
phemous way as did the authors of
Prometheus Bound and Moby Dick, and
the book of Job and (in its essence)
Paradise Lost —those men of genius who
made their complaint against cruelty and
injustice so powerful that they did not
plunge men into hopelessness but exalted
them to defiance. A major defiance of
the universe becomes something positive,
a creation, a genuine work of art; a
minor complaint, subh as Beware the
Cuckoo, remains merely a complaint,
something negative, or, at best, the
thinnest of creative statements.
Because of his tone of humor, his
moments of affirmation and defiance, and
his genuine love for nature, one cannot
help suspecting that Professor Moll does
not really feel quite so upset about flies,
fledglings and aged draught-horses as he
pretends. Reading through the book,
one quickly learns his method: if he says
it is a fine day in the first stanza, there
will be a thunderstorm before the end;
if he mentions a tree, somebody is going
to cut it down; if he sees a bird, some-
thing is going to kill it; if he encounters
a butterfly, something is going to eat it.
This, surely, and with the evidence of
many poems similarly constructed in his
earlier books, is merely a formula.
Whether the theme is inevitable, aris-
ing wholly from an oversensitive out-
look of life, or whether, as is more
likely, it isi sometimes inevitable and
sometimes a formula, one is certainly
glad to escape from it into such pleasantly
casual narratives as “Figure in Clay,”
“The Well and the Star” and “Bush Psy-
chologist” and into what might be called
the side-issues of the central lament —
Professor Moll’s capable technique, his
humor and his realistic evocations of ther
Australian earth.
Beware the cuckoo though she bring
Authentic tidings of the spring,
And though her voice among the trees
Transport you to the Hebrides!
I saw her come one sunny day,
And pause awhile and fly away,
And I knew where she took her rest
There was a honeyeater’s nest.
Later I came again and found
Three dead fledglings on the ground,
And red ants busy in a throng
At throats that had been made for song.
Australia from Horseback.
In her first and best book, Australia’s
Alps, Elyne Mitchell saw Australia from
a pair of skis. These kept her admirably
close to the earth and when she whizzed
pr leapt she seldom lost herself for long
in mid-air.
In Speak to the Earth, a fine book
about cattle, mountains and men in the
Upper Murray, she saw the landscape
from horseback, and again did well. In
Soiland Civilisation, an earnest, valuable
but inflated and polysyllabic essay on
erosion, the author rode too high a horse.
Images in Water, her latest volume
from Angus and Robertson, mingles the
faults and the virtues of her writing
fairly evenly: with, on the whole, a bias
towards the virtues. It consists of a num-
ber of short essays, or sketches, or prose-
poems—one really does not know what
to call them, for they have not the form
and movement of the true essay—on
various aspects of life in her favorite
countryside, these being illustrated with
some excellent photographs of everything
from ice-flowers to wombats.
On the debit side it must be said that
Elyne Mitchell still mounts her high
horse from time to time. It is significant,
perhaps, that among the many quotations
of poetry none—or so it appears—are
from Australian writers. Elyne Mitchell
clearly loves poetry; but not, one would
gather from her strange observation on
Wordsworth —“He fell short of seeing an
ultimate grandeur”—from her praise of
D. H. Lawrence and from her failure in
an essay on nature poetry to mention
Clare, Davies, Blunden or Robert Frost,
with knowledge wide and deep enough to
justify her ventures into criticism.
There is a typical essay on the moun-
tain phenomenon known as the “Spectre
of the Brocken”:
These horses, surely, are high enough.
This is a rare and beautiful sight that
Elyne Mitchell is describing, and it is
enough to have seen it, and to have set
it down so capably. There are few men
and very few women who could have
brought this sort of incident into Aus-
tralian descriptive writing. But, alas,
even thrown in shadow on to a mountain
mist, the horses are not elevated enough
for the writer. She draws a deep breath,
and she is off into the upper air attempt-
ing, by some not altogether logical pro-
cess, to relate these Australian horsemen
to the Magi of the Bible, and her prose,
with her, is wobbling uncertainly in
space:
Our shadows faced towards the east. In-
finitely ancient, infinitely new, was this vision
of three riders held within the luminous,
mysterious circle. Seekers? Of old they
sought a birth, the Word Incarnate, and
found there, in the Logos mystery, the com-
pletion of all mysteries, yet the unfolding
of all knowledge.
It would be possible to divide this
essay into two parts, the real and the
inflated; and one wishes that, throwing
the second half away, Elyne Mitchell
would be reckless enough to do that to her
writing ; for when she is on the earth she
loves Australia and can describe it with
clarity, gaiety and passion. Her book —on
the credit side —is about the wombat that
fought the terrier in the snow, about the
echidna that sank into the ground
beneath her father’s chair, about the
white kookaburras that lived in the
willow, the phalanger that barked in
the night, the Khancoban Falls on one
of the source streams of the Murray,
the turtle in a Towong lagoon, the gum-
trees cracking and crashing in the night
with weight of snow on their branches;
it is about “the loops of the Murray
reflecting the red and the chill blue in
lovely pattern, winding through the white
paddocks, an ephemeral beauty that
would go with the sinking sun, just as
the snow would be taken by the wind in
the night”: it is a series of extremely
attractive pictures of the Australian earth.
Elyne Mitchell’s problem, no doubt,
has been how to work these little pictures
—which it is her particular gift to make
—into some sort of literary form longer
than the paragraph. Obviously, instead
of being packed on to a high horse and
carried up into the clouds, they should
be related to some central theme: the
history of a district, perhaps, or the lite
story of some family of the district.
In the south the Alps were shining—the
brittle clarity of snow mountains —above the
opaque* unmoving Nebelmeer. Below the
dense sea the familiar paddocks were remote
and unimagined. And out on that cold
blueness beneath the white mountains a
complete rainbow lay on the still mist. It
moved and we stopped to watch it. The
bright circle stayed immobile, too, and
achieved clarity as we drew together. Pro-
jected on to the mist, circled in color, were
three shadow horsemen. Between us and
Towong’s skyline of the Australian Alps
was the vision of the ephemeral “Spectre
of the Brocken” —first recorded as being
seen from the Brocken in the Harz moun-
tains in 1780 —which is the shadows of
figures standing on a clear summit, thrown
on the mist by the level rays of the sun
as it rises or sets. And the rainbow nimbus,
the solar “Glory,” transformed the image
to something utterly strange.

HE DOESN'T LOOK A KILLER
Wonderful night. Wonderful
party. Wonderful people.
Wonderful girl, and the stars
are riding high.
The girls are all mad about
Bill ... the men all want to
take Betty out. Last good-
byes are over, and Bill's car
flashes into the night,
"The wrecked car was found
at 3.10 a.m.”, according to
Police reports. Betty died in
the ambulance. Bill escaped
with a broken arm, and
lacerations.
Bill’s a steady, clean-living
boy. He’d only had a few
drinks, but they sent him up
on a manslaughter charge. It
was one of the jurymen who
whispered “He doesn’t look
a killer.”
So driver, keep a clear head.
You never needed it more
than now, when violent road
accidents are killing over
1,300 Australians a year and
maiming more than 25,000.
Remember, even moderate
drinking tends to whip up
delight in speed, and slow
down your reaction just when
split-second control is needed
to avert a fatal road smash.
After even two drinks, drive
with extra care. Don’t step
on it. Observe all traffic rules,

What is a Diamond Jubilee ? Is it
different from a Diamond Anniver-
sary ? Can you quote an authority?
Webster’s defines “Diamond Jubilee”
as being “The celebration of a
diamond anniversary; specifically the
celebration in 1897 of the 60th year
of the reign of Queen Victoria.” The
same dictionary defines “Diamond
Anniversary” as being “an anniver-
sary celebrated upon the completion
of 60, or according to some 75, years
following the event commemorated.

Were John and Charles Wesley, the
great evangelists, married men ?
John Wesley married in 1751 Mary
Vazeille, a widow, but the union was
unfortunate and she finally left him.
Charles married Sarah Gwynne,
daughter of a Welsh magistrate living
at Garth, on April 8, 1749. She died
in 1822.

A street organist busker
Was old Ballarat Joe,
Who rendered fine music

SPOTLIGHT ON ITALY.
From now until its election-
day on April 18 Italy will stand
out more and more prominently
in the spotlight of the world
drama. The shape and direction
of history are in the balance
there.
The elections are generally
accepted in overseas press com-
ment as the “deadline” in the
present tense issue of peace or
war. It is agreed practically by
everyone that they will either
settle the world down appreci-
ably or else start something.
The electioneering, N. Y.
“Times” correspondent Arnaldo
Cortesi has reported from Rome,
is being carried on “with a vim
unusual even in a country like
Italy, where the people take their
politics more seriously than in
most.” The basic issue, with all
that is implicit in it in respect
to the much larger issue of peace
or war, is whether the Com-
munists will win support en-
abling them to take outright
control or at least force their
way back into the Government,
or whether they will be over-
whelmingly defeated.
Reports on the campaigning
to date show little optimism in
any such defeat. Italian Com-
munists are generally reported
to be of very considerable
strength, and Italian conditions
in a state likely to win them
votes from many non-Com-
munists. Against that might be
set the usual tendency of corre-
spondents to overestimate rather
than ever underestimate Com-
munist voting strength.
A Washington correspondent
of N. Y. “Daily News” repre-
sents high U.S. authorities as
holding the gloomy view that if
Italy should go Communist “the
entire European continent would
be doomed and Russia might
seek to make a clean sweep
from the Atlantic in the west to
the Pacific in the east by the
end of the year.”
At the last elections in 1946
the Communists polled roughly
20 per cent, of the vote. The
figures were: Christian Demo-
crats (present Premier de Gas-
peri’s party), 7,876,000; Soci-
alists, 4j,500,000; Communists,
4,200,000; other parties, about
4,000,000. The Communists hav-
ing been meanwhile refused a
place in the. composite Govern-
ment, this now is made up of the
Right and Centre parties, the
main one of which, the Christian
Democrats party, can be alter-
nately called the Catholic party.
It not only has Vatican support
in the sense that the Vatican has
come out strongly against Catho-
lics voting Communist, but the
Church is openly campaigning
for it in every pulpit and through
lay organisations.
Since the 1946 elections all the
numerous parties, except only
the Christian Democrats and
Communists, are reported to
have lost ground, leaving those
two main parties quite outstand-
ing. Nonetheless minority parties
could possibly hold the balance
after April 18. The Christian
Democrats are reported as con-
fident that they will be able to
prevent the Left-wing group— ■
the Communists, Left-wing Soci-
alists and a few other minor
parties, all combined as a
“People’s Bloc” —from obtaining
a clear majority. The N. Y.
“Times” Rome correspondent
reports, however, that the Chris-
tian Democrats “foresee that the
People’s Bloc will issue from the
elections as the most powerful
group in Italy,” but with the
minor parties still holding the
balance of power.
The importance of the elec-
tions in Italy itself —though in
this not really isolated from
their great importance in the
current world drama —is indi-
cated by the quite extraordinary
extent of the Church’s participa-
tion. “The Pope himself,” the
same correspondent reports, “has
in numerous speeches reminded
Catholics that it was their duty
to vote, and to vote against
parties that were enemies of
religion.”
As cabled, the Pope in his
Easter blessing in St, Peter’s
Square on March 27 said; “The
great hour of Christian con-
science has come. At this time
of anxiety and danger, fraught
with perhaps irreparable world
decisions, the shadow of singular
gravity has fallen over us.
Rome is in a phase which de-
mands the highest vigilance,
continuous action, and uncon-
ditional readiness from Chris-
tians.” And he referred to
Christ’s words, “He who is not
with Me is against Me.”
As well, there is the active
participation. “Southern Italian
Bishops went even further
[than the Pope] and told the
faithful that under certain con-
ditions they were justified in
using ‘material force’ to defend
their spiritual interests. The
Cardinal Archbishop of Milan
instructed priests to deny sacre-
ments to members of the Com-
munist party.”
“If the coming election is
crucial for Italy,” the N. Y.
“Times” correspondent has
commented, “it is equally so for
the Vatican. The tiny State of
Vatican City is the centre of the
Roman Catholic world and is
completely surrounded by Italian
territory. It could hardly hope
to continue its activities undis-
turbed if Italy were to go Com-
munist. The consequences for
the Catholic Church of a Com-
munist victory would be likely
to be so far-reaching that few
people in the Vatican care even
to think about them.”
The correspondent also re-
ported Catholic Action as
rapidly building up “an organisa-
tion similar in many respects to
that of the Communist party” ;
it “hopes by this means to get
every Catholic voter to the
polls.”
As a lay organisation Catholic
Action can do the direct practi-
cal work —meetings, posters and
such things-r-outside the scope of
the Church. It has set up civil
committees to see that voters do
their part, the feeling being that
every voter induced to go along
will mean one more vote against
the Communist side. But, “des-
pite everything, the strength of
the Communists and their allies
is admittedly very great —so
great, indeed, that anti-Com-
munists cannot afford to over-
look a single vote if they wish
to keep them out of power.”
Of the numerous reports any-
thing but optimistic of a Com-
munist setback, one in the
usually well-informed “U.S.
News-World Report” sees the
Communists and their allies as
likely “to collect 40 per cent, of
the vote.” In that forecast “and
their allies” should not be over-
looked. Nor, either, should past
overestimating of Communist
polling strength.
Regarding the vote percentage,
diplomat onlookers in Europe
have been quoted as expecting
“the Communist bloc, together
with Communised Socialists,”
will poll more than 40 per cent,
of the vote. “If the total is more
than 50 per cent. —highly doubt-
ful —nothing can save Italy/’
“U.S. News-World Report”
points out that the elections, in
any case, will not finally settle
things. If the existing Govern-
ment is returned with sufficient
strength and backing to keep the
Communists out of power,
“that’s likely to start a fight be-
tween Left and Right.” The
Communist aim then would be
“to control Northern Italy at
least,” and “U.S. intervention
might then be expected.” In this
respect, President Truman, at the
time the U.S. occupation troops
were withdrawn, most definitely
promised that the U.S. would act
if Italian freedom and independ-
ence should be threatened.
That Truman undertaking is
now counted on to deter the
Communists from trying to seize
power by force. If, despite that,
the Communists should make
the attempt, Italy, as “U.S, News-
World Report” puts it, “would
become another Greece; but,
instead of 20,000 Greek guer-
rillas, several million Italians
would be involved. And the
threat to France, to all Europe,
would be moving closer.” So,
too, would war; Italy being a
vital ground in the struggle
against Soviet imperialist expan-
sion.
Just how vital Italy is as a
military post in the current
struggle was heavily emphasised
by the complete reversal of Wes-
tern policy regarding Trieste.
The setting-up of Trieste as
another Danzig, along with the
whole Italian peace treaty, was
regarded even by those who did
the framing as an expedient
makeshift, the hopeful assump-
tion being that if the Western
side were accommodating on the
“little things” the Kremlin would
reciprocate when it came to the
“bigger things.” There has been
a great disillusioning in the land
since those hopeful days.
Indeed, if it were not for the
10,000 U.S. and British troops
stationed there, with sea-
power and airpower within call,
Trieste would have been folded
in behind the Iron Curtain long
ago. The promise of it and of
some of the African colonies
might well have a decisive .effect
in the elections, most Italians,
like most people anywhere, being
first of all nationalists. It is
actually a small bid in view of
what is at stake, since Com-
munist control of Italy, by bring-
ing the Soviet advance right into
the Mediterranean, would make
war sooner or later inevitable,
A London correspondent of
N. Y. “Times'” reports “a con-
siderable degree of alarm” in
Britain “over the Communist
threat to Italy and the central
Mediterranean.” It is pointed
out, the correspondent says, that
the loss of Czechoslovakia and
the probable loss of Finland to
the Soviet side, though serious
blows, were not unexpected,
whereas Italy has always been a
country of the Western com-
munity :
The loss of Italy to Communism
would thus be a far greater political
blow since it would give the
Communists major success in Western
Europe, add to the isolation of Austria
and assist the Communists in their
drive for power in France.
It may be pointed out, against
the implications of most of these
reports, that a contrary vote
would be just as serious a set-
back for Moscow, and also that
there have been signs indicating
that the Communists’ alleged
hold on Italian labor might have
waned. The Communist-led
general strike last December was
described as “a partial failure
a heavy blow to the prestige
of the Communists.” Moreover,
Italians were at that date re-
ported to be “quite clearly grow-
ing tired of the unrest into which
the Communists have plunged
their country”; and, “what is
more disturbing to the Com-
munists is that the signs of the
anti-Marxist reaction are parti-
cularly noticeable in the indus-
trial north from which they draw
the greater part of their follow-
• 59
mg.
However that may affect the
elections, there is another dan-
gerous aspect full of threat, it
beiiig apparently taken for
granted that a Communist
defeat at the polls will “almost
certainly usher in a period of un-
precedented trouble and unrest.”
The Communist-party leader
Palmiro Togliatti has stated that
“if they fail to win, the Com-
munists will not abide by the
election results.” In that case,
there would be strong U.S.
support for the Government side
in the fight that would follow.
It is without any doubt for just
such a contingency that
American forces have been
“moving into the Mediterranean
in concentrations unusual in
peace-time.”
April 18 could very easily
start trouble.
The New Slavery.
Referring to “the horror and
agony of a modern slave system
and of the most extensive and
ruthless dislodgment of popu-
lations known to history,” which
the Axis Powers started, N. Y.
“Times” points out that “these
same practices are being con-
tinued by the victors on an even
vaster scale.”
It threatens to make a
mockery, the N.Y. paper com-
ments, “not only of Allied war-
time professions but also of the
war-crime trials of the Nazis and
of the Japanese accused of simi-
lar crimes.” As plainly indicated
by the Nazi-Soviet collusion and
plotting for aggressive war
against Poland (as exposed in
the published secret documents,
B. 25/2/’4B) that is not the only
aspect on which the trials are
made to appear hypocritical.
N. Y. “Times” is able to pre-
sent Uncle Sam in lilywhite rai-
ment on the slave issue, he hav-
ing handed over his war
prisoners in France to the
French. True, of course, though
Uncle Sam had no urgent call
to take p.-0.-w. labor back
home, and he did take quite a
number of scientific and other
specialists. Moreover, handing
over to France would be the
convenient thing to do, and
Uncle Sam would know very
well that the handed-over would
be used as labor.
That, however, doesn’t alter
the fact that “there are still
4,000,000 prisoners-of-war being
used as slave-laborers Ger-
mans, Japanese, Hungarians,
Poles and many other nationali-
ties” :
Far more than half of them are
in Russia, where they join millions
of Russians in the same camps. But
hundreds of . thousands of war
prisoners are employed in a like cap-
acity throughout Eastern Europe, in
Britain, France and Belgium, even
in the Middle East and Africa. Their
ranks have been swelled by many
thousands of civilian captives deported,
expelled, imprisoned or kidnapped by
Russia and her satellites, or turned
over to them by the Western Allies
either in the name of “repatriation”
or under some other guise. Most of
the members of the long-estabiished
German colonies in Eastern Europe
and thousands of Balts and other
Eastern Europeans have suffered this
fate, as well as thousands of dis-
placed persons. The word “repatria-
tion” was also made to cover the
expulsions of some 12 million people
from Eastern Germany and the
Sudetenland,
A pretty picture for the halls
of advanced civilisation!
Regarding the reference to
Britain, the position, as reported
in London “Times,” is that,
under the evenly-regulated re-
patriation which has been going
on for a long time, all German
p.-0.-w. should be back in Ger-
many by the end of July. Also
it should be said on the British
treatment of German p.-0.-w.
that no fewer than 20,000 of
these have applied to stay on in
Britain as civilian farm-
workers ; but “it is understood
that a limit of 12,000 has been
set.” Moreover, “there are also
Germans, as well as Italians,
who, having been repatriated,
are now Writing to their former
employers in Britain asking if
they can return and bring their
wives and families with them.”
For viewing in the light of
the late war, the bombings of
Britain and all that, an odd little
vignette is given in the London
“Times” report. Stating that
“the individual Germans who
have been billeted on farms
have earned the respect and
friendship of their fellow-
workers” and that “there would
be no objection in the villages
if they were allowed to stay per-
manently,” the report adds:
“This was evident at Christmas,
when Germans were welcome
guests at many family gather-
ings.”
It hardly seems to warrant
any representing! of J. Bull as a
villainous slave-owner.

The Czech Move. —A Washington
report in N. Y. “Daily News” de-
clares that it was the timing—not the
event itself —of the Red coup in
Czechoslovakia which caught U.S.
diplomats and combat experts flat-
footed. “Czechoslovakia had been
accepted as a democratic country for
almost three years. And intelligence
reports to Washington indicated that
the Communists were going to take
a severe beating in the next elections
early in May. Apparently the same
reports reached the Kremlin, and the
Communists decided to act first.”

Hitler Won. —American writer on
foreign affairs William Henry Cham-
berlin recalls an acid remark made
to him by a British journalist when
he was in England: “You know.
Hitler really won this war —in the
person of Stalin.” “Nothing that has
happened since I heard this bitter
wisecrack,” comments Chamberlin,
“has disproved its essential truth. We
are living in just the kind of world
we might be expected to live in if
Hitler’s drive for domination of con-
tinental Europe and adjacent parts of
Asia and Africa had succeeded. It
is a world of tyranny and totalitarian-
ism, of constant threat and tension,
of compulsory spending on armaments
on a scale that would have seemed
fantastic before the late war but is
now generally accepted as grimly in-
evitable.”

Good Old J. Bull. —Another U.S.
comment on the famous old battler,
matching the praise recently quoted
here from N. Y. “Times”; this is
from the “World-Telegram,” referring
to the timely Marshall-Plan aid; “We
are proud that America wants to
help and is able to do so. But we
don’t feel a bit self-righteous about
it. To share with a people who have
given so much to the world in the
past eight years of heroic sacrifice
is a privilege. It is also a good
investment in democracy and our own
security.” It adds that, however near
collapse, Britain “is not going to
fall, because America and Britain will
stand together in this world crisis—
not only as they did during the past
war but even closer together. We
have faith in the British people. We
have faith in the American-British
partnership.”

Goebbels on Propaganda. —Among
other interesting comments in his
diary, soon to appear in book form,
Goebbels dealt with one subject in
which he was something of an
authority, namely propaganda. He
didn’t think much of the hate-Germany
variety: “A much more clever form
of propaganda against the Reich has
been proposed in the United States,”
he wrote. “The idea is not to go
against the German people but
against Nazism. I sense a certain
danger If I were on the enemy
side I should from the very first day
on have adopted the slogan of fighting
against Nazism, but not against the
German people. That’s how Cham-
berlain began on the first day of the
war, but, thank God, the English
didn’t follow through.”

End of a Farce. —Despite asser-
tions about U.S.-Britain continuing in
Berlin, “Wall-street Journal” corre-
spondent Joseph E. Evans reports that
the American Military Government
there “is being reorganised on a scale
so drastic as to leave only the barest
pretence of continued interest in the
ideal of a unified Germany”; an
ideal that has been turned into a
farce. “The economics division, once
the largest and far and away the most
important Military Government
branch, has been dissolved, most of
its experts en route, amid incredible
confusion, to Frankfurt-am-Main, the
capital of Bizonia. Its place in Berlin
is being taken by a microscopic office
of economic adviser, designed to help
preserve the illusion of quadripartite
government. The finance division has
undergone a similar metamorphosis.
This,” Evans adds, “is evacuation of
Berlin all right,” though “America
will hang on to its quarter of Berlin
as long as there is any possibility
of doing so, for the sake of prestige
and strategy.”

Rocket Town. —One of the most
curious towns of the world has been
pictured in “Life.” Built in the past
four years at a cost of $100,000,000,
its population now about 12,000,
it is in the centre of a military re-
serve of 1000 square miles out in a
stretch of Californian desert; with
grim appropriateness, not far from
Death Valley. The main job of those
who work there is research into
rocket flight and propulsion. Its
official name is Inyokern Naval Ord-
nance Test Station, Inyokern for
short.

America’s Forces. —When Mr. Tru-
man called on Congress to authorise
conscription and otherwise ensure the
armed strength to stop the Soviet
Bear in its tracks, U.S. forces, ac-
cording to Scripps-Howard foreign
editor William Philip Simms, were
down to “560,000 officers and enlisted
men.” That, he said, “is 110,000
under authorised strength. Some
350,000 are overseas. The remainder
are only half-trained or are nearing
the end of their enlistment.” He
quoted an army spokesman as admit-
ting that “scarcely 30,000 U.S. com-
bat troops could be mustered for im-
mediate combat duty.”

The Rio Pact.—Argentina and Chile
were leaning on a reed that wasn’t
there in talking of invoking the Rio
Pact in their Antarctic claims against
Britain. Washington “Post,” stating
that the U.S. had laid down at Rio
that “nothing in the treaty had any
bearing upon questions of sovereignty
within the security zone, has
commented: “The purpose of the Rio
pact was to protect the Americas
against outside aggression, not to up-
set the status quo with respect to
territories. Certainly Argentina an
Chile cannot hope for the treaty to
be construed as calling for relinquish-
ment of British, French and Dutch
possessions in the West Indies and
the Guianas. Argentina s attempt to
misuse the Rio accord is especially
unctuous, since she has not yet
ratified the pact.”

BID FOR DICTATORSHIP.
The Socialists in Canberra are getting
ready, with Communist help, for their
effort to purvey a totalitarian system of
regimentation to the Australian people,
while masquerading still as democrats and
conservators of the Commonwealth’s
economic stability. When Parliament re-
assembles members’ thoughts will be fixed
on the referendum campaign, for which
the Prime Minister will adjourn the
House again in a month’s time in order
to take the platform in the electorates.
The points about this referendum in
which the central Government at Can-
berra seeks to acquire from the States, by
permission of the electors, permanent,
control over all prices, rents and charges,
are these;
The Government is seeking to continue
for all time a war-time encroachment on
popular liberties.
There is no question of the maintenance
temporarily of either Commonwealth or
Stste controls over prices so long as the
economic situation makes these necessary.
The Commonwealth control extends under
evaporating “transition powers” till the end
of this year. The States can then reassume
and continue these controls, as they have
reassumed other controls their Parliaments
consider necessary.
The Chifley Government’s object is not
to safeguard our traditional system of free
enterprise and commercial exchange, but to
abolish it and substitute socialisation of all
industry.
It can go far towards doing this if it
obtains control of all price-fixing, by driving
out of business any person or any com-
pany not in its favor. Central
control over every smallest business trans-
action would be the perfect corollary to
a central monopoly of all banking. That
is precisely why the Government is seeking
these powers.
The Socialists are emphasising the
feature of rent-control, and will seek to
coerce the electors by representing that,
unless a “Yes” vote is given, rents will
soar beyond any control whatever. This
is false, and Ministers know it is false.
Apart from the fact that the States’ Fair
Rent Courts exist to regulate rent-charges,
as they did long before the Common-
wealth took over the authority as a war-
time measure, even under Commonwealth
control the administration has been
throughout in the hands of State
deputies, because rental bases must neces-
sarily vary in each State with varying
types of building and costs of mainten-
ance. There is not a State Premier who
has not announced that, if Canberra
control over rents were to cease to-
morrow, his Government would imme-
diately impose control regulations so long
as these might be necessary.
So palpably insincere is the Chifley
Government’s argument on any basis of
preserving the liberty of the citizen to
run his own business, large or small,
which he has hitherto deemed to be his
right, that some subtle purpose must be
sought for this impudent bid for dicta-
torial powers. The Attorney-General has,
in point of fact, already given the show
away in his argument in the Bank Grab
Case before the High Court. He was
speaking on the question of the “absolute
freedom” of trade in and among the
States, as guaranteed in the Constitution
(Section 92), and denied that the Con-
stitution gives any right to individuals to
engage in inter-State trade. Going further.
Dr. Evatt said:
I submit that the Commonwealth has a
legislative right to make a choice of persons
who are to trade.
Exactly: and he and Mr. Chifley are now
about to invite electors at this referendum
to give them powers to rub out any in-
dividual traders they dislike, just as they
are trying under the Bank Grab Act to
rub out the trading banks. Pretty soon
only red-headed men will be allowed to
run fruit-barrows
These aspiring dictators in Canberra
want to be able to choose who shall trade,
who shall own shops, who shall have bank
advances —all under their absolute decree
through (1) a monopoly of banking and
(2) the power to fix any manufacturer’s
or shopkeeper’s prices. The differ-
ence in their procedure in (1)
and (2) is that while they have
refused (being afraid of the electors) to
hold a referendum on the one issue, and
could not constitutionally be compelled
to do so, in the second matter they
cannot dodge a reference to a popular
vote.
Although the ranks of “Labor” are by
no means solid in support of Mr. Chifley’s
socialisation programme, the Communists
are all for it, and their hopes of further
establishing themselves, through the
Chifleyites, as the real controllers of Aus-
tralian industry explain why they are re-
fraining from trying to bring on a general
strike at this moment. That would make
the loss of the referendum appeal certain.
Their votes for “Yes,” and those of the
blackmarketeers, are cast in advance of
the poll. It is mainly the Chifley Govern-
ment which enables the local Moscow-
directed gang of traitors to maintain their
recurring irritation-strike tactics, and
while the Chifley Government serves them
thus it may, with their consent, stay where
it is.
The Communists’ Queensland “block-
ade” has already done great harm to the
Canberra Government’s prospects—not
only directly, by causing a serious division
within the A.L.P., but also because it
became obvious that Mr. Chifley—
Would not intervene at the outset to help
a State “Labor” Government under direct
attack from the Communists, or the Queens-
land people from great loss and hardship
—all of it unnecessary.
Would not intervene at the end, even to
cut short the distress of thousands of
workers’ families in famine conditions.
Was content to let the Communists go
their hardest to try to displace the Hanlon
Government and to abide by the result of
the struggle.
From which considerations there is one
deadly plain deduction. Mr. .Chifley is
all for increased powers, but will not even
use the powers he at present possesses to
combat the Communists.
He has powers today, under the Crimes
Act, with which he could have knocked
the Communist gang in Queensland stone-
cold in one hit. He would not use those
powers. He even condones these wreckers’
assertion of what he calls their “philosophy.”
But the powers he now seeks are those
which will help the Communists. Absolute
authority in the central Government,
asserted by decree and enforced by a horde
of officials, is the very foundation of Com-
munist dictatorship. And this is what Mr.
Chifley is asking in his referendum appeal.
Even he does not want a “Yes” vote more
than the Communists do.
There is only one safe course for the
freedom-loving elector. He cannot let
this test pass as something which can be
remedied by a reversal of opinion at some
time later. The Reds are at the gate, and
the Chifleyites are opening it to them. To
Mr. Chifley, elected as a democratic
leader of a free people, the only answer
should be to refuse one tittle of further
power over any department of our work-
ing life. He has flagrantly abused the
trust given him in 1946. His real masters,
or at least his warmest adherents in this
issue, are our national enemies.
“More power” is the referendum
appeal. For what? Is there the slightest
sign that Mr. Chifley would draw the
line anywhere—use his powers at any
juncture—against the foreign-inspired
minority which is in sheer malice spread-
ing chaos in our industry, wrecking our
democratic system, and even destroying
the “Labor” party? Let every elector —
every trade-unionist, too —ask himself
what class of people have been
thriving most these past two years
with the centralisation of controls
at Canberra under the Chifley regime.
Why are those callers of • strikes,
who never lose a day’s pay, who can
travel anywhere within or beyond Aus-
tralia on top priority, immune from all
penalty for the misery they cause? Why
are there never any “powers” invoked
against them?
TJie electors of Australia will shortly
be asked to grant to this so-called “Gov-
ernment” at Canberra still wider rights to
“select” (in Dr. Evatt’s phrase) who shall
or shall not be “controlled.” In an
emphatic two-letter word they can put
beyond doubt what they think, at any
rate, of one game State Premier’s stand
against all “mimicking Molotovs.”
Canberra Doctor's Diary.
“Under a previous’ Australian Govern-
ment the only discernible foreign policy
was appeasement of the Hitler and
Japanese Fascists, which resulted in
active encouragement to our enemies to
prepare for war. The policy culminated
in the closing of the Burma Road against
China and inadequate preparedness for
the defence of Australia against inva-
sion. All this shows the absolute
necessity of a self-reliant Australian
foreign policy which, closely linked to
that of the British Commonwealth, sup-
ports U.N.0., which alone can prevent
a third world war. In that organisation
Australia is taking a leading part with
dignity and self-respect.”
That was' Dr. Evatt letting himself go
on February 14, 1946, so pleased
with himself and his U.N.O. performance
as to throw caution to the winds and in-
dulge in an unworthy fling at his op-
ponents, There follow sundry Evatt
commentaries on the great new foreign
policy, for the most part reproduced from
official publications. It should be premised
that “the close link” with “that of the
British Commonwealth” was not pre-
served. On the issue of South
Africa’s treatment of its Indian
citizens and its proposal to incorporate in
the Union, with the approval of the great
majority of the natives, the contiguous
territory that was German —though not
for as long as the Afrikaners have ruled
it —Our Foreign Policy, while ap-
proving of Moscow’s vast annexa-
tions, and even of its barbarous
detention of the hundreds of Russian
women married to Britons and Ameri-
cans, meanly deserted the sister-
Dominion. Australians visiting or emi-
grating to South Africa, as many have
done, report that the whites are bitterly
resentful still. The commentaries:
“Despite the forecasts of the sceptics and
the men of ill-will, the United Nations is
now successfully launched.” March 13,
1946. [lt is sinking fast- ]
“Does Russia intend aggression? Hav-
ing during the last four years come to
know some of Russia’s greatest statesmen,
I take the view that the Soviet Union’s
policy is directed towards self-protection and
security against future attack.”— March 13,
1946.
“We made a proposal regarding Trieste
.... a form of internationalisation 'of
Trieste and its hinterland.... without giving
either the Italians or the Yugoslavs con-
trol.... We proposed that all parties to the
treaty should undertake to respect the in-
tegrity of Trieste.” November 8, 1946.
[Three parties to the treaty now propose
to return Trieste to Italy.]
“I demand a just and fearless decision
[the U.N.O. intervention or ‘quarantine’
decision] on Spain.”— June 7, 1946.
That brought an indignant protest
from Senator Armstrong, now Minister
of Munitions, on July 7, 1946:
I join issue with the Minister of External
Affairs in regard to the Spanish question.
I cannot see what is to be gained in the
present world set-up by changing the ruling
power in Spain. Why we should take sides
with the dictatorship of the Left is beyond
me The Minister has fallen into a childish
trap in such a way as to secure publicity
on the front pages He has embarrassed
Australia’s friends without gain to the
nation.... I believe he acted without in-
structions from the Government We
should have learned the wisdom of not
interfering in the affairs of other nations
from the outcome of American interference
in Argentina.
Events, ending in the Congress votes
for the inclusion of Spain in the Mar-
shall Plan, have completely justified
Senator Armstrong. In his disgust with
the Spanish business the Senator sug-
gested that a Foreign Affairs Committee
should be set up “to ensure that Minis-
ters engaging in discussions abroad shall
give voice to considered decisions.” But
Mr. Chifley or Caucus refused to inter-
fere, and the One-Man Band went on
performing, though often off the note:
“The Security Council is in this appall-
ing position, that nothing may be done
about a dispute which has come before the
organisation. From the beginning you know
that nothing may be done about it. Bitter
speeches are made this way or that way,
and you are always conscious of the
threat that at the end the next business
will be called and no recommendation or
suggestion can be made by the Council.” —
November 8, 1946.
“One of the outstanding results of Aus-
tralia’s membership of the Security Council
has been general acceptance of the technique
of approaching disputes by investigation
and fact-finding In the Indonesian dis-
pute Australia secured an immediate cease-
fire order by the Security Council.”— Jan.
1, 1948. [“Australia” — i.e., Dr. Evatt—has
never even tried to secure a “cease-fire” order
from the Communists who have boycotted
Dutch East Indies shipping, to the immense
loss of this country, since September, 1945.]
“In the Palestine dispute,” to use our
Minister’s terminology, the doctor, as
chairman of a U.N.O. special commit-
tee, brought off the partition “settlement,”
which has been drowned in the blood of
2000 Jews, Arabs and Britons. Anyway,
Zionists and friends, gathered in the Mac-
cabean Hall, Sydney, gave him credit for
bringing it off, one saying “Dr. Evatt has
become the voice of justice and honor
in the international councils of the
world,” and another hailing him as “the
instrument of God” (“Hebrew Standard,”
December 18). Bearing up against the
avalanche of praise, in which Bishop
Pilcher and Landa, M.L.A., joined, the
“instrument of God” turned to the
Security Council again:
It has been stated that the partition pro-
posal cannot work, because it contains no
provision for its enforcement. Those who
talk or write in this strain forget or do
not know that the Security Council has
the right and duty to intervene.
This, in a statement issued on March
22, he altered to “The Security Council
seems to have no power whatever to
overrule the recommendations of the
Assembly,” meaning the crazy vote for
partition. And, averting his gaze from
the course of events, he had the face to
maintain that “the decision” was “just
and impartial,” could have been enforced,
“probably with little difficulty,” had “the
Great Powers adhered firmly to it,”
especially as “the new Jewish State and
the new Arab State were each to be en-
titled to establish its 1 own militia forces,”
and had been “undermined by intrigues
directed against the Jewish people.” It
was “undermined” by the murder bands
and the Ben Hechts.
There is littl? space left for the doc-
tor’s achievements as Attorney-General,
but four quotations can scarcely be
omitted:
“The right to ‘fire’ is characteristic of
the social system against which the Labor
movement must fight and win.” — Plea for
the 1944 powers referendum, which was
defeated by great majorities, greatest of all
in, “Labor" States.
“The object of this Judiciary Bill is to
increase the number of Justices of the High
Court from six to seven volume of work.”
—March 29, 1946. [W. F. Webb, the
Queensland C.J., was appointed April 12,
1946. He has never yet sat on a High
Court case.]
“The aim of this Stevedoring Industry
Bill is to achieve industrial peace and con-
tinuity and efficiency of work. The special
position of Tasmania, of Western Aus-
tralian ports, of Queensland ports and
Darwin illustrate the dependence of Aus-
tralia on sea transport for inter-State trade,
while the entire overseas trade is carried
out by shipping. The new commission will
consist of a Judge of the Arbitration Court
and five other members, two to represent
the Waterside Workers’ Federation, and will
be clothed with the maximum powers that
the Constitution allows; and there will be
waterside-employment committees at ports
on the same model. Future employee
registrations will be confined to members
of the Waterside Workers’ Federation.” —
Feb. 21, 1947.
“This Conciliation and Arbitration Bill
opens a new chapter in Australia’s attempt
to regulate the relations between employer
and employee. It builds on the fourtdation
of experience. The new emphasis must be
on informality as opposed to formalism;
on expedition as opposed to the law’s de-
lays: the bill requires a conciliation com-
missioner to deal expeditiously with in-
dustrial disputes There will be in the
neighborhood of 15 conciliation commis-
sioners at £l5OO per annum, retiring at 65.
Practically a judicial salary.”— March 12,
1947.
During the whole.of last month Syd-
ney was out of beer because a concilia-
tion commissioner “required to deal ex-
peditiously with industrial disputes” had
failed to settle a wrangle with a parcel
of brewery hands. And since the first of
March Queensland has been blockaded
by the Communists of the Waterside
Workers’ Federation, in concert with the
Communists of the Seamen’s Union, the
law having been set at defiance and the
rights of the people mocked at by a
Communist member of the Stevedoring
Industry Commission at a meeting of
that body itself.. An Australia-hating
immigrant, this ruffian could be prose-
cuted under the Crimes Act and, on con-
viction, imprisoned and deported. Of
course, Dr. Evatt would never do any-
thing like that. He is kind to Com-
munists. They were his referendum allies
in 1944 and are about to become his
referendum allies again. And didn’t he
lift the ban on them and forget his pledge
to reimpose it if they sabotaged industry
and transport any more? Mr. Fadden
diagnosed his case pretty well: “His
head is so far in the clouds that he can't
see what is happening at his feet” —
though he could if he wanted to.
Hanlon's Victory.
Pleased as he must be with his triumph
in the Queensland strike, Premier Hanlon
can take credit for having done much
more than that. He is the first latter-
day Labor Premier or Prime Minister
to take a stand for arbitration and the
rule of industrial law and hold fast to
it. From the first hint of the strike to
the last hour when the beaten Com-
munist strike-leaders realised that their
game was up, Mr. Hanlon never budged
an inch. What he said he’d do he did,
a healthy change from the bluster and
retreat of the squibs in Canberra and
Sydney who not only did nothing to help
him, but meekly connived at Communist
attempts to starve Queensland into sur-
render. *
Perhaps Mr. Hanlon’s most important
achievement was to draw his people
together against a common threat. This
Communist-run strike was no battle of
workers against bosses, since the strikers
were Government employees; and Queens-
landers of all classes knew it. Their
Premier showed them that, for the most
part, Australians have a common interest
in maintaining industrial as well as other
laws, and in doing so broke clean away
from the evil “Labor” notion—persisted
in by Federal “Labor” even during the
deadly threat of invasion—that there are
two nations in Australia, “workers” and
“exploiters.” In this, as in his handling
of the Blair Athol coal agreement, he
has advanced his own Labor party im-
measurably by showing that, given proper
and courageous leadership, it can make
a success of government.
Last, but not by any means least,
Queensland’s Old Digger Premier has
shown up the screaming Communists for
what they are —yelling larrikins, all there
for fight when the odds heavily favor
them, but quicker off the mark than a
scared rabbit when anybody stands up to
them, and dingoing on their misled
“mates” without hesitation. As a result
union after union refused to join the
strike, and union after union started a
witch-hunt for Communists.


PLAIN ENGLISH
War and Civil War.
If it comes to war, as it may—the Russian
attempt to shut the Western Allies out
of Berlin had nasty possibilities, and there
are combustible situations in Austria,
Trieste, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Palestine,
Persia, China and Korea —the public
safety will require a swift and effective
round-up of all active Communists in
Australia and their expulsion from all
Government departments in which they
could do mischief.
But the leader of the “Government”
which allowed Communists to blockade,
first, the Dutch East Indies and then
Queensland, maunders that Communism
is “a political philosophy” which must
on no account be indelicately handled.
To his Minister of Labor and National
Service it is “Christlike.” His Attorney-
General and Minister of External
Affairs has never publicly receded from
his “view” that “the Soviet Union’s policy
is directed towards self-protection and
security against future attack” or re-
trieved from the rubbish-tip his 1943
“undertaking” that he would “reimpose”
the ban on Communists if they returned
to their knavish tricks. And his Minister
of Immigration and Information, after
wishing a passport for the Communist-
leader Sharkey on a very reluctant Indian
Government, which has since rounded up
Communists on its own account, said
those opposing Communism were “suffer-
ing from a phobia,” and what they had to
do was to fight capitalism. And that at
a Victorian “Labor” conference.
At that same “Labor” conference a
delegate from the Postal Workers’ Union,
addressing Senator Cameron, the Post-
master-General, said there were Com-
munist cells in his department, and “if
war broke out Australia’s postal com-
munications would not be secure.” Did
the old gentleman incontinently deny it?
Was the former secretary of the Socialist
party dismayed? Not a bit of it!' He
was silent for 24 hours or so. Then he
said—though not to his fellow-delegates—
he would “order an inquiry,” at
which the man from the Postal Workers’
Union would be asked for “specific evi-
dence,” after which “any person” found
“using the department to take part in sub-
versive activities would be dealt with.”
By being smacked on the wrist with a
telegram-form, no doubt. For “every
officer in the departmerit is entitled to
his own opinion about any particular
person or matter,” and presumably if
any “officer” placed traitorous action at
the service of his “opinion” it would be
really annoying.
While the septuagenarian Minister was
blithering, a dispiriting dispatch arrived
from Canberra —dispiriting because it
was obviously meant to be reassuring.
“Federal officials” were concerned in
it: “Federal officials claim,” The “claim”
was that “precautionary measures
taken by Migration and Security are ade-
quate to prevent ‘planting’ of foreign
agents among migrants”; but it was
hedged about with qualifications. For*
one thing “an official aliens register
is kept,” but “it is not complete”
There followed the blundering admis-
sions that Communist'S control trade-
unions, and thus have “unlimited
opportunity” for the study of vulnerable
key industries”: a “serious weak spot in
security precautions.” Again, “not only
aliens but extreme Left-wing British sub-
jects are a potential source of informa-
tion leakage”:
In one Police Court case during the war
it was revealed that a British subject with
Communist sympathies had obtained con-
fidential information and sent it to high
Communist officials in Australia, evidently
with the intention that it should be sent
abroad.
The “British subject with Communist
sympathies” was Rudkin. Abroad was
“Vienna.” And after the fellow had
served a stretch and had been spared in-
ternment, though the military recom-
mended it, “Labor” found him a job in
the C.S.I.R. ay a research chemist.
But “Federal officials” must spare his feel-
ings. They, too, are candid only by
accident, and the courage that goes with
plain-speaking is not in them or their
political bosses.
Only criminals and madmen want an-
other war, but it would be stark folly to
scout the possibility that they may get
one. If they do, Australia will be in
a sorry plight; unprepared at every
point. No forces capable of putting up a
fight; no MacArthur to lean on, nor any
Churchill to blame if things go wrong ;
only a “Government” which couldn’t
lead a horse to a trough, and which,
though its Attorney-General profe'sses a
complete understanding of the Common-
wealth Constitution, has never realised
what its makers meant when they wrote
Section 119: “The Commonwealth shall
protect every State against invasion
and against domestic violence.” Yet
advocates of insurrection abound, among
them unconcealed agents of the foreign
Power that is trailing its coat through
two continents; and they have been hit-
ting the “Government” and the nation in
the eye ever since the Japanese laid down
their arms.
Was Keane a Crook?
Acting with a promptitude sharply in
contrast with the delays which marked
the proceedings in the Court of first
instance and the gap—nearly 12 months
—between conviction and appeal, the
N.S.W. Full Court found for Goldberg in
what the papers, with charming
unanimity, have agreed to denominate
the Keane Trunks Case.
Goldberg—Joseph to customers, “Joe”
to very dear friends —was convicted on
April 11, 1947, and fined £250. The
charge was that he had imported pro-
hibited goods, over 4000 dollars’ wortli
—goods carried from the U.S.A. as part
of the luggage of a Miss Kelly (she was
employed in the American section of the
Australian Customs outfit) and dispatched
from Sydney to Melbourne to the widow
of the Minister, Keane.
Goldberg admitted having bought the
goods (practically all feminine finery) for
Keane, using 3000 dollars handed to him
by the Minister and money of his own,
but denied culpability. His counsel
argued that there was no evidence that he
had imported the goods, and that the
import-prohibition regulation was invalid.
Their Honors heard argument on
March 22, and, with Easter intervening;
had their judgment ready on April 2.
On the importing issue they found for
Goldberg, Chief Justice Jordan saying
that the evidence did not warrant a con-
viction. There was “ample evidence”
that Goldberg had “assisted in the ex-
portation of the goods from the United
States” but not that he was “implicated
in their importation into Australia.”
Conviction quashed, with costs of the
appeal against the Customs.
In delivering judgment, the Chief
Justice said that before Keane’s death it
was arranged that he and his secretary
Kirk (for whom Goldberg had bought
two strings of pearls, still unpaid for)
should join Goldberg in a business
partnership. Goldberg was to provide
the money (dollars, though his Honor
naturally did not stress this point), Keane
to “find the contacts” and Kirk to “do
the work.” It was Kerr, another Aus-
tralian Government employee, who “had
stickers put on the trunks addressed to
Mrs. Keane,” and Miss Kelly declared the
contents “personal effects only,” which
was not the case. Apparently the trunks
were passed through the Customs at
Sydney, then forwarded to Melbourne for
Mrs. Keane.
“It is curious,” the C.J. commented,
“that Goldberg should have been selected
as the person charged.” “If anybody
imported the goods,” said Justice Street,
continuing on this line, “it would rather
seem to have been the Customs. It is
a little difficult to see how it could be
suggested that any subterfuge was used
when the whole matter was being handled
by senior officers of the department con-
cerned in enforcing the provisions of the
Act.”
If only because of these judicial re-
marks, though there was an unanswerable
case for Parliamentary action without
them, the next move should be made in
the House. It cannot now be contended
or pretended that discussion of Keane’s
part in the transaction might prejudice a
party to a pending Court case. The
necessity for a debate ending in the
appointment of a tribunal with power to
summon all persons who can give first-
hand evidence in the 4000-dollar affair
(not one has been called yet) and any
other Keane transaction which may come
to light should be evident to everyone
who holds not only that Cabinet Ministers
with vast opportunities of enriching them-
selves surreptitiously should be straight
but that they should be cleared of any sus-
picion into which they have fallen, if un-
founded, If debate and inquiry are re-
fused, cynical people will conclude, how-
ever falsely, that Keane’s administration,
before the chapter closed, had become
a ramp,
"Labor" in Corruption.
Victorian “Labor’s” Easter conference
was presented with the full threat of the
split in the ranks (foreshadowed in B.
10/3/’4B), and temporarily averted it only
by dropping the penalty of expulsion pre-
viously decided oh as the due of those
who opposed blue-ribbon industrial-group
candidates in union elections.
Thus the local “Labor” promise to
“eliminate Communism in the unions”
goes by the board. The threat of several
powerful Communist-run unions to dis-
affiliate with the A.L.P. and withhold
union dues did the trick.
Some lively scenes marked the debate
and the voting (193 to 57). D. Lovegrove,
A.L.P. organising secretary, calling for a
“definite statement” from the Chifley
Cabinet on Communism, said;
If we want to solidify the people of this
country who are heartily Sick of the iron
curtain in this matter, they had better lift
it.
Mr. Lewis, of the Locomotive Enginemen
(A.F.U.L.E.), Chifley’s old mob, declared
that “inside the ‘Labor’ party there is
room for all shades of opinion, includ-.
ing the Communist party,” and that he
had found Communist union leaders
“honest, truthful and desirous 1 of peace
in industry.”
Amid howls of rage Lewis and another
delegate came to blows, and one of the
credentials committee, Maloney, con-
fessed; he had failed in his duty in letting
Lewis into the conference. But this was
only play-acting. The conference de-
nounced its Communists and endorsed
the “industrial group” as a counter-
activity, but the final decision was that
if the Corns, insist on remaining in the
unions nothing can be done about it.
The A.C.T.U.’s Mr. Clarey, having de-
clared “We must make it clear that we
have no alliance, understanding, or any
connection whatever with the Com-
munists,” doubtless will proceed to preach,
for referendum purposes, that all is now
well.
Palestine Modus Vivendi.
What some Australian dailies call “a
new pact” on Palestine is said to have
been reached by the British and American
Governments. It is to form an interna-
tional police force “to guard sacred
places” after the British mandate ends
next month.
It is only superficially “new.” Plainly
it would be useless for the chief Western

Powers to attempt to guarantee the
integrity of countries under threat by the
Soviet and to leave Palestine alone to
face the Russian aggression without help.
Whether or not U.N.0., that rough-
hewn statue to a moribund idea of Demo-
cratic-Communist agreement, approves
the new arrangement or not will hardly
matter. Its approval was either not
sought or became perfunctory in the
democracies’ working plans for Germany,
the Western European union, Greece,
Italy, the decisions over Trieste, and the
British guarantees given to Austria.
U.N.O. is bound to matter less and less as
the Marshall Plan gets under way and the
peade-seeking peoples of the northern
hemisphere draw together, under its in-
centive, in a new society of nations to
keep the peace and ensure it.
The displaced-persons problem in
Europe was the starting-point of the post-
war fillip to Jewish emigration to Pales-
tine, D.Ps. are as much a burden as
ever in disordered Europe, and that
burden is likely under Russia’s “cold
war” against European rehabilitation, to
increase rather than diminish. Behind
the “iron curtain” the hordes of D.Ps.
seeking escape are greater than ever.
President Truman’s was a statesman-
like gesture when he announced that he
was changing his mind on partition of
the Much-Promised Land, and that the
repercussions upon his Presidential
prospects of the change of mind did not
affect his attitude. Public men in U.S.A.
are learning, painfully of course, what
generations of British statesmen have
learned in the past: that the job of world-
policeman demands occasionally personal
sacrifice to high principle.
POLITICAL POINTS
In losses to victims and dupes alone,
the Communist blockade of Queensland
is reckoned to have cost £20,000,000.
What the unions had to pay in toting the
carcasses of Communists around the
country until their tails went down —a
process accelerated by fear of the con-
sequences of the ugly proceedings in Ber-
lin —is known only to the charmed
circle ; but the outlay, fines and hotel
bills added, must have run into
thousands.
Self-recorded itinerary of “Runaway”
Rowe, a fit expression coined by Lang’s
“Century”. He bolted by car from Bris-
bane to 'Tweed Heads, spent the night
there, continued by car to Coff’s Harbor,
boarded a plane for Sydney, spent two
days in Sydney (and for Communists
nothing but the best suffices), re-
turned by plane to Coff’s Harbor, picked
up his car, and so to Brisbane again and
quod, the wretched creature’s last words
being that all hell would roar if he wasn’t
incontinently released. Any intimidated
striker would be glad to take for his
year’s pay what Rowe cost his union, the
once-great A.E.U., in a month. Petrol?
Communists never have to worry about
that.
“The prospect of the speedy passage
through Congress of the Marshall-Plan
legislation is not very hopeful.” Our
Parliament and people were told that on
March 11 in a paper tabled by Chifley
for his Minister of External Affairs. At
the end of last week the legislation was
not only through Congress by enormous
majorities—with extension to Spain
recommended by the House and, after a
conference of managers, left to a vote of
the European beneficiaries —but the first
relief ships were on their way with a
blessing from the President, who said
also:
This measure is America’s answer to the
challenge facing the free world today—the
best answer we can make to vicious, de-
tested misrepresentations of our efforts for
peace.
And so it is ; magnificent withal.
On March 11 Dr. Evatt weighed in
with the frigid statement that “the Soviet
Union regards United States aid to
Europe as an extension of so-called
‘dollar diplomacy’ aimed particularly at
the Soviet Union.” U.S.S.R. “policy,” he
certified on another occasion, was
“directed towards self-preservation and
security against future attack.”
The ban on the Communist conspiracy
was lifted with “S. M. Herald’s”
approval; “Mr. Curtin” was then “Our
Leader.” Granny now expresses contempt
for “ ‘Labor’s’ timid approach to a ques-
tion now strongly agitating public
opinion,” for Chifley’s “evasive device in
alluding to foreign ‘isms’ at the Victorian
A.L.P. conference” —he spoke as a shiver-
ing spinster of too certain years might
have spoken m 1918—and for all such
“futile substitutes.”
McGirr, to his lasting disgrace and
that of his “Government,” let the
A.R.U., “led” by Facing - All - Ways
Ferguson, hold-up goods consigned to
Queensland so that a Labor State might
be starved into submission and its fighting
Premier brought down. McGirr’s attitude
to Communists is the same as Chifley’s
and proceeds from the same cause—
scare.
With the humorlessness of the breed,
Sydney “Tribune” solemnly recorded
that Comrades celebrating something
or other in Surry Hills sent a telegram to
Paterson, Queensland’s Commo M.L.A.:
“Every baton that drew blood that Wed-
nesday gained a million supporters for
the Queensland strikers.” No mention of
how many of the million were at the cele-
bration, but there must have been a lot
of ’em. A whip-round for strike finance
brought in 3360 —pence.
Dr. Evatt had Franco’s Spain
placed in “quarantine” by a U.N.O.
resolution. Last week the U.S, House of
Representatives voted three times
for inclusion of Franco’s Spain in the
Marshall Plan, one of the Congressmen
remarking, heedless of the doctor’s feel-
ings, that Franco was Europe’s oldest
and stoutest bulwark against Commun-
ism, or words to that effect. Peace has
its ironies no less than war, and it is the
same with history.
In days which were comparatively
sedate, the White Australia policy always
needed careful handling and the judicious
turning of a blind eye on situations which
could not be remedied by too-zealous in-
terference. Now, with the world position
changed for the worse, the administration
has fallen into the clumsy hands of Cal-
well, and folly succeeds folly.
On Saturday night a negro pug who
came to Australia in 1938 and married,
giving two little hostages to fortune, was
arrested after a bout at Bowral (N.S.W.)
and consigned to a Sydney jail in hand-
cuffs, preparatory to deportation without
his wife and children. The blow fell
on the poor devil when a negro pugilist,
with the sanction of “Clumsy” Calwell’s
“Government,” arrived in Sydney con-
signed to Wren; and more are expected.
A minor horror incident to the war in
Palestine, which was never going to hap-
pen (“the Arabs are only bluffing ; they
won’t fight”), is a reissue of Zionist stuff
in these parts. Rabbi Schenk cast up in
Newcastle with “information” for
Rotary: “The Colonial Office is deliber-
ately causing strife in Palestine, because
Britain wants to stay in control there,”
though not under U.N.O. conditions.
And Professor Stone is spouting Zion-
ism, a subject from which he shied away
till his feelings overcame him, from an
A.B.C, station in Sydney. Neither of
these gentlemen is an Australian, as are
Sydney’s Samuel Cohen and Melbourne’s
Archie Michaelis, who have repudiated
the Schenk poison. The rabbi arrived
from New York in 1939, the pro-
fessor from Leeds, via N.Z., in 1942.
Meeting in camera, Sydney County
Council, which “controls” Bunnerong,
made plans for winter rationing of light
and power, winding up with the an-
nouncement that power cuts were immi-
nent. In other days, such a communi-
cation from a public “utility” when pri-
vate utilities are functioning would
have resulted in an instant public de-
mand for the resignation of the whole
bunch. But people have become so used
to weakness in high places that nowadays
they do no more than mutter a few
imprecations and prepare for the ex-
pected deprivations by buying candles
and flatirons and converting kerosene-
tins into backyard stoves,
A Vice-Consul for Czechoslovakia, a
Mr. Halla, has arrived in Sydney. On
the water when Benes lost his courage,
Masaryk lost his life and the Czechs and
Slovaks lost the country, Mr. Halla pro-
fesses no interest in politics, being “en-
tirely concerned with economics.” He,
will buy things for Czechoslovakia, in-
cluding “a considerable quantity of wool.”
But why should he bother about buying
wool when Benevolent Ben has his ear out
all ready to be bitten? Benevolent Ben
has a “philosophic” feeling for Czecho-
slovakia —hasn’t it “nationalised” the
banks?
Archaeologists have discovered an
ancient Egyptian city, “a provincial
capital,” under the sands of the Sudan.
The way things are going, it won’t be
long before many of our “provincial
capitals” will be fit only for archaeological
study.
Police description of the Communist
Rowe, who commanded the Queensland
strikers to show “the Fascists” they could
“take it,” and couldn’t “take it” himself,
quitting cold:
About 37 years, sft. 6in. to sft. 7in. tall,
clean-shaven, light-brown* hair, sharp
features, long nose, eyes close together,
thin build. Usually dressed in grey trousers
with a grey speckled coat and walks with
a swagger.
“About 37,” and “walks with a swagger.”
But not a military swagger.
Labels and ages of other Brisbane
mob leaders, as recorded on one day’s
charge-sheet;
Michael Healy, secretary Labor Council,
41; Archibald Thomas Nichol, union
organiser, 33; Alexander Macdonald, union
secretary, 37.
Six years ago, Ward being the “respon-
sible” Minister, all union staff men of
military age, Communists, fellow-travellers
and the rest, were exempted from service
on the ground that they were doing work
of pressing national importance or some-
thing like that. The same privilege,
eagerly availed of by funkhole artists
and their patrons, was extended to war-
time appointees to union jobs or sinecures.
That Sandy Cape lightship’s breaking
her moorings is no new thing. Before the
late war a Japanese lugger towed her into
Rockhampton. The port authorities there
didn’t even know she was missing.
The Bulletin’s Jim Grahame has had
a book of verses published at the cost
of admirers at Leeton (N.S.W.). A
worthy recognition of good and faithful
work, and “Bohemia,” issued by Mel-
bourne’s Bread and Cheese Club, notes
that if Leeton had had its way there
would have been another:
The Hon. Ben Chifley was asked to write
a foreword, but was disinclined to do so
as it might establish a precedent, so the
honor fell to J. K. Moir. One fault with
the book is that so much is offered for
so little.
The like can never be said of the re-
luctant patron’s own works, as collected
in “Hansard” and the Statute Book, and
reviewed by the Taxation Commissioner
and the Auditor-General.
Slogan for a Communist strike organ-
iser: “When it comes to the last ditch
I’ll be found hiding in it.”
According to Sydney’s “D.T.,” which
is on excellent terms with Canberra,
“Australia will end the financial year with
an overall dollar deficit of £90,000,000.”
How about calling in Goldberg and
Wren as advisers? Friends of “Labor”
both, and dollar deficits never seem to
bother them.
The Federation of North Queensland
Chambers of Commerce to the Prime
Minister, concerning the strikes and other
things:—
Urge you to use your powers to make
production real, and not mere words.
Though the strikes were then holding up
goods worth about £15,000,000, and all
urgently needed in and out of Queens-
land, all the great advocate for increased
production could manage was “It’s a
matter for the Stevedoring Industry
Commission.” “It’s a matter for” —he
drones these words in his sleep.
Lang’s group has changed its name to
“the non-Communist Labor party.” It
was that in 1940, when Beasley, Rosevear,
Ward, Mulcahy and Sheehan were
“elected as members.” Ward was never
active in the group, and in process of
time was heard declaring that “Soviet
Russia has made more progress in 25
years than any capitalist country has
made in 10 times that period.” Others
who accepted membership seem to have
forgotten that they were ever “non-
Communists.”
Complaining that “petty stoppages” on
the N.S.W. coalfields “sap our strength,”
Williams, the exploded Communist presi-
dent of the Miners’ Federation, “de-
nounced” them:
These stoppages do not injure the mine-
owners, but mean disunity, disruption and
, conflict in our own ranks.
In other words, the Corns don’t want
strikes unless they “injure” the mine-
owners and the public. The strikes they
do want and get have once more injured
South Australia, which at the beginning
of the week was short of gas and without
trains.
MacArthur note by the Ballarat-born
Peter Russo, who was Professor of
Modern Languages at Tokyo University,
and has since been an “Argus” writer of
credit and renown:
When I saw him last year he took time
off from the remaking of Japan to tell me
how much he had enjoyed his stay in Aus-
tralia, and how impressed he had been with
Mr. Curtin and Vic Patrick.
Mr. Curtin and Vic Patrick!
Richard Hughes, from Tokyo, to the
Melbourne “Herald”:
American long-range strategy in the
Pacific now completely by-passes Australia.
The Americans now congratulate themselves
on their escape from the responsibility of
maintaining a base on Manus, which Aus-
tralian foreign policy insisted was exclusively
Commonwealth territory.
Another of Dr. Evatt’s achievements.
What a lot we have to thank the doctor
for!
The press-boomed Fraser, his thoughts
turned from shaky Eden-Monaro to a
possible Canberra electorate, is all burnt-
up with sympathy for Canberrans who
have to live in “rooms and sheds and
garages.” He wants “recreation officers,”
clubhouses and community-centres, a
cafe and a cafeteria, with orchestra, open
until midnight. Such thoughtfulness will
thrill the homeless thousands not in Can-
berra, and millions not there who would
have to pay for the circus.
There are Housing Ministers in Can-
berra and most of the State capitals
(Sydney has a Building Materials Minis-
ter also), and there are Housing offices
in practically every major town. Sur-
veyors, inspectors, secretaries, clerks and
the like abound. Yet brick-production in
January was nearly 6,000,000 below the
December output, cement was down
10,400 tons and there were 90,000 fewer
tiles. Suggestions that all the Ministers
and their staffs be put to making bricks,
cement and tiles are useless—they would
only gum up the clay with forms and
rubber-stamps.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Occupying one of the hot seats in
Europe at present, Lieut.-General Lucius
Clay, Military Governor of the U.S. Zone
of Germany, was born in Georgia
and graduated from West Point the year
the First World War ended. During most
of the second scrap he was right-hand
man to General Brehon Somervell at
headquarters of American Army Service
Forces, but after Cherbourg fell he was
sent to straighten out the shipping
tangle at that port. His effective handling
of the assignment probably led to his
appointment as deputy to General Mc-
Narney, first Military Governor of the
U.S. zone. McNarney’s headquarters were
at Frankfurt, and Clay looked after the
Berlin end of affairs. When he succeeded
McNarney as Occupation chief 15 months
ago he stayed on in Berlin. Those who
have worked with and under him know
him as cool and efficient and have no
doubt of his ability to hold his own in
the present battle of nerves.
Master of the freighter Indian Tanker,
which recently took a wheat cargo out of
Geraldton (W.A.), Capt. J. T. Heir,
C.8.E., D. 5.0., also holds the Order of
Suvorov, a Russian decoration which
carries the privilege of free travel any-
where on Russian territory for the holder
and his family. At least, that is the
theory; the skipper hasn’t tried it out
yet. Captain Heir, who went to sea at
15, served on the northern run to Russia
during the war. On one Arctic run two
torpedoes crossed the bows of his vessel
and hit a ship in the next line. The Ü-
boat surfaced and was sunk by Heir’s
gun. Next trip the convoy was attacked
from the air for six days. A direct-hit
sank the commodore ship and Capt. Heir
took over command. During the
remaining five days and nights of the
trip he never left the bridge; the convoy
got through, and the Order of Suvorov
was the recognition of Heir’s devotion to
duty.
So many Judges and legal men have
lived into the eighties that octogenarian-
ism has become almost a common charac-
teristic of the law. Not so many have
reached the nineties, but the list is quite
remarkable: Sir Isaac Isaacs, 92 ;G. H.
Wise, still alive and 95 in July; James
Georgs Drake, last survivor of the first
Federal Ministry, 91 ; Thomas Mann,
who retired in his 94th year ; De Courcey
Ireland, died at Heidelberg (Vic.) well on
in the 90’s. The Earl of Halsbury, Lord
Chancellor and editor of “The Laws of
England,” reached 98 ; Lord Lyndhurst,
91; Lord Brougham, 90; Lord St.
Leonards, Lord Chancellor, 94; and Sir
Charles Fitzpatrick, Chief Justice of
Canada, 90. Sir Wm. Mulock, of Canada,
Chief Justice of Ontario and Chancellor
of the University of Toronto, beat the lot
of them —he scored 100. He represented
thp Canadian Government at the inaugu-
ration of the Australian Federal Parlia-
ment.
Revisiting his native Maoriland after
30 years’ absence. Dr. Diamond Jenness,
chief of the Anthropological section
under fihe Canadian Government and
anthropologist of the Canadian National
Museum in Ontario. An old boy of
Victoria College, Wellington, he gradu-
ated in 1908. He is an authority on the
Eskimo and American Indian; for his
Children of the Twilight, published in
1928, the M.L. University conferred on
him an honorary degree of Doctor of
Literature, Dr. Jenness was a member of
Stefansson’s North Polar expedition in
1913-16 and for two years was unaware
that a war was raging in Europe.
“Pawang”; The world’s strangest pro-
fession lost its most distinguished member
when Harry Price died, at 67, in England.
He spent his life investigating haunted
manor-houses, laying spooks that had
terrorised Suffolk villagers for genera-
tions. and testing the claims of mediums.
He wrote The Haunting of Cashen’s Gap,
The Most Haunted House in England,
Ten Years’ Investigation of Borley Rectory
and Poltergeist over England. One of his
achievements was to settle, in his labora-
tory in South Kensington, the problems
of fire-walking, though without making
any visible effect on the spate of stories
about the fire-walkers of Singapore and
Fiji. He bequeathed to London University
his library of 20,000 volumes dealing with
all types of matters beyond ordinary per-
ception, from alchemy to medieval magic.
In 1925 he founded the National Labora-
tory of Psychical Research.
One hundred years ago last month,
according to tradition handed down from
SAVINGS BANKER .
teller to teller of the Savings Bank of
South Australia, a bearded Afghan
walked into a tiny office in Adelaide,
poured a small heap of coins on the
counter and became the bank’s first cus-
tomer. There was no Coventry on hand
to record his features for posterity, so
the likeness here appended in recognition
of the bank’s centenary year is that of
Hermann Neuenkirchen, general-manager
of the institution which claims as de-
positors three out of every four persons
in South Australia, their total deposits
exceeding £56 million. The centenary
was celebrated by a get-together of
friendly rivals from other, States. Head
men from the State Savings Bank of Vic-
toria, the Savings Banks of Hobart and
Launceston, N.S.W. and Westralian Rural
Banks turned up, the Commonwealth
Savings Bank was represented by F. O.
Walters, of the Sydney branch, and the
Associated Savings Banks of New Zea-
land by their president, M. Connelly.
Neuenkirchen, tenth g.-m. of the bank,
joined its staff as a junior 41 years ago.
E. R. Reynolds, K.C., who welcomed
the delegates to the fourth convention of'
the Law Council of Australia, in Mel-
bourne, has had a rapid rise to leader-
ship of the Victorian bar. Said to be the
best-dressed man in Selborne Chambers,
he has been more successful as a pleader
than as an aspirant for political honors —•
in several attempts he has always finished-
up second-best. His somewhat austere,
legal bearing apparently doesn’t appeal to
electors, although he’s really quite an
affable chap.
Dead in Bristol (Eng.), Dom Richard
Hugh Conolly, one of the most distin-
guished of Australian-born Orientalists
and one of the world’s foremost Hebrew
and Syriac scholars. Born in Carcoar
(N.S.W.) in 1873, he was little known in
his own country. He had the curious dis-
tinction of being the first Roman Catholic
cleric to take a degree at Cambridge
since the Reformation. From 1904 he
was Superior of Benet House, the Down-
side house of studies at Cambridge, and
became a member of the Board of
Oriental Studies at the University and an
examiner in the Oriental Studies Tripos.
He had lived at Downside Abbey since
1939, latterly very much an invalid, and
since 1939 had held the titular dignity
of Cathedral Prior of Canterbury in the
R.C. Church.
Flight - lieutenant Harry Belcher
has spent the last two years search-
ing the islands north of Australia
for lost comrades. He flew more than
1200 hours combing the islands of Ceram,
Ambon, Halmahera and Borneo and
found 46 crashed aircraft but, unfor-
tunately, no crews alive. His journeys
in a Catalina flying-boat up unexplored
tropical rivers through jungle-covered
gorges into country never seen by the
white man would thrill most of Australia’s
youth. Natives were his best bet for in-
formation, A few lollies and their
“jungle wireless” brought news of many
an ill-fated operation by an R.A.A.F.
bomber-crew. Success of his work
prompted the Yanks to offer him a simi-
lar job. Immigration Minister Calwell at
first refused him a passport, but has since
reversed his decision.
Doyen of Australian composers and
still one of the most virile, Louis Lavater
recently reached his 82nd year in Mel-
bourne. Four years of serious illness in
hospital hasn’t dimmed his spirit, and he
is at present fighting Canberra for a fair
go for composers. The Government, he
points out, assists writers, but does no-
thing for musicmakers, although everyone
can read what the writer says and he can
get straight to his public without any
intermediary except the printer, whereas
the composer is completely dependent on
the executant for publicising his work.
As the vast majority of the public can’t
read music it is also dependent on the
executant, so the tendency is to glorify
pianists, fiddlers and singers and almost
deify conductors, although they are not
the creative forces in music at all.
Lavater’s first composition was performed
at the Exhibition in 1889 by the first
State orchestra formed in Australia.
Since then he has written a host of
orchestral, choral, chamber, pianoforte
and violin pieces and has set scores of
his own songs to music. Under the pen-
names of Arthur Mayship, Leo Bartels,
John Stephani and Frank la Borde he
has written voluminously about his sub-
ject. He is an associate of the Royal
Musical Association of Sweden.
While passing through Sydney on his
way back to Borneo, James S, Chisholm
was captured and held long enough for
Prior to record this impression of his lean,
brown features. Apparently the British
Colonial Office, to which he belongs, has
the same traditions of silence as the
R.N., but it was possible to extract from
him that, as District Officer of Kota
Belud, in North Borneo, he presides
over 5000 square miles inhabited mainly
by 30,000 Bajaus, Illanuns and Dusuns.
Kota Belud used to supply all North
Borneo and most of Sarawak with beef,
but the herds were seriously depleted by
the Japs; the idea now is to establish a
Government livestock-farm in the dis-
trict to breed bigger and better animals,

Australia and New Zealand by investigat-

Chisholm, a 37-year-old New Zealander,
left the Shivery Isles in 1932 to seek a
short-service commission in the R.A.F.;
color-blindness ruled him out, and he be-
came a London bofcby for a year or so
before going to Borneo in 1935. The
Nips interned him at Kuching for nearly
four years.
The war is not yet over for the mine-
sweepers, Captain R. V. Wheatley,
R.A.N., senior officer 20th Minesweeping
Flotilla, has dragged his sweeps through
most fields laid in Australian waters. In
sloop Warrego during the war he sur-
faced 11 mines of the field that sank
the American City of Rayville off Cape
Otway. Shortly afterwards, with Swan
hit, of Darwin’s harbor defence
during the first raid devolved on him.
Zigzagging at speed up and down harbor
Warrego drew off some attention from
U.S. destroyer Peary, gaining her a brief
respite before she sank, guns firing. Now
in Swan, Wheatley is sweeping in the
New Guinea seas, mostly Allied fields.
Still awaiting attention are a couple of
nasty Jap magnetic minefields round
Bougainville.
Recently appointed organist and
master of the choristers at St. Andrew’s
Cathedral, Sydney, H. Hugh Bancroft,
recognised as one of the leading organists
in Canada, has been at Vancouver Cathe-
dral since 1946. Born at Cleethores,
Lincolnshire, he went to Canada in 1929,
and, at the Canadian Musical Festivals, in
1935 and 1940, he established himself as
a conductor and choir trainer of out-
standing ability. For years he has broad-
cast over the Canadian Broadcasting Cor-
poration as an organist and conductor,
and some of his compositions are to be
found in the Canadian hymn-book. He
is also conductor of the Vancouver Bach
Choir and head of the Theory Depart-
ment of the British Columbia Institute of
Music. Aged 43, he served in the war
as a gunner with the Royal Canadian
Artillery.
Victorian Dr. Donald Thomson,
awarded the Cuthbert Peek grant c for
anthopological studies in Arnhem Land
(B. 31/3/ ’4B), first made acquaintance
with that part of the world as a
lone observer with his wife as his sole
assistant. Later he was Special Com-
missioner for the Commonwealth Govern-
ment charged with keeping the peace
between Japanese trepang-fishers and the
blacks. ‘On one occasion he walked 100
miles to the coast to answer a message
from Canberra. He had just captured a
large snake previously unknown to science,
and if he had left it in his camp Binghi
would certainly have eaten it. The
only thing to do was to take the reptile
with him, so his wife carried the snake
and he the heavy luggage on the
200-mile trek. He has led three expedi-
tions to the Never Never and his re-
searches have attracted world-wide in-
terest. During the war he was a wing-
commander charged with secret missions
which entailed much sailing in his own
cutter into enemy-infested waters and be-
ing dropped behind the Japanese lines in
New Guinea and other islands. He was
invalided out severely wounded after one
of these missions.
Into the Silence:
In Adelaide, at 70, Charles Percy Allen,
general secretary of S.A. division of the Red
Cross Society. Bora in England, he came to
Australia as a young man —the ship in which
he arrived was wrecked on Wardang Island,
off the South Australian coast. For many years
he was an accountant with Adelaide commercial
houses; he took on the Red Cross job in 1941.
In Melbourne, at 85, Sydney Sampson, mem-
ber for Wimmera in the Federal Parliament
from 1906 to 1920. Born at Creswick, he took
up land at Warracknabeal, founded a newspaper
at Jeparit and advocated better water and road
facilities for the Mallee. In Parliament he had
much to do with the adoption of the Hume
Weir scheme. In later years he ran a chain
of suburban newspapers and was a director of
several* concerns.
With the death at 93 of Michael Lynch, of
Woorak West, via Nhill, a link with Adam
Lindsay Gordon was broken. Lynch was born at
Mount Gambier and raced and rode horses in
the district in the poet’s day. He owned the
racehorse Gambler and was starter for Nhill
Race club for 17 years.
In New York, at 78, Mrs. Marizele Wirth,
widow of the founder of Wirth’s Circus. Her
son Frank is producer for the American Shrine
Circus and Philip runs the Australian “Greatest
Show on Earth.”
In Melbourne, at 68, L. B. Bolton, represen-
tative of the Metropolitan Province in the
West Australian Legislative Council, and
managing-director of Boltons, Ltd., formerly a
coachbuilding firm, but converted by him into
a motor-body works. He was for five years presi-
dent of the W.A. Chamber of Manufactures
and Mayor of East Fremantle for a similar
period.


Society
"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Melbn”: Senator Armstrong and
General Berryman, charged with the im-
portant task of drawing-up the Royal pro-
gramme, have come to complete agree-
ment with the Victorian Government as
to the desirability of avoiding the
“window-dressing” which threatened to
make the South African tour a fiasco ; a
measure of this desire is a plan for a
drive through the industrial suburbs of
Collingwood and Fitzroy. Why not
Footscray, whose Mayor and councillors
have so long been burning with indigna-
tion over facetious references to their
city? Footscray actually isn’t any drabber
than other Melbourne suburbs, and it
boasts some pleasant vistas and a fine
view of Australia’s principal temple of
worship, the Flemington racecourse.
Moreover, the traditional aroma of the
district, as his Worship has frequently
stated without intimidating Tivoli
comedians in the slightest, comes from
tanneries outside, not inside, the suburb.
This could be explained to their Majesties.
After the Royal visit no professional
funny-man would dare to bring out the
ancient wisecrack.

“Bridport”: If the Bishop of Bathurst
decides to take literally the Equity Court
injunction prohibiting him from using any
other service than that prescribed in the
prayer-book, there’ll be some queer reper-
cussions. He could insist on all intending
communicants giving in their names the
day before; could require the clergy to
“call and advertise” open and notorious
evil-livers. He would insist on the
congregation kneeling and not squat-
ting and see that parishioners duly
paid their ecclesiastical dues every
Easter. The parson would be in
in preaching one of the old
“homilies” instead of a sermon; but all
hymns would be cut out, as there is no
provision for these in the service. Should
the bishop take it that the learned Judge
meant that the prayer-book was to be
adhered to without deviation, harvest-
festival services would be forbidden, also
various other services which figure in
most churches today. Gunpowder
Treason service and another observance
for King Charles the Martyr would be
compulsory. And the bishop would
have to make housing provision for
the crowds of infants that would be
piled on him in consequence of the
prayer-book having omitted to give direc-
tion for the child to be handed back
to its parents after baptism. I don’t
see the bishop enforcing it all!

“Jim O’Keeffe”: “Plop” stirred up a
spot of action round here (B. 10/3/’4B).
One Bill, large, muscular and truculent,
has in the past provoked to violence
sundry Cyrils, Cecils, Claudes and other
bearers of genteel monickers and has
scored a lengthy succession of wins. For a
long time Alastair took Bill’s insults with
a wry grin, but the other day he sighted
Bill’s birth-certificate, consulted a dic-
tionary of names, and diligently spread
the news that Bill’s baptismal names were
William Athelstane, and that Athelstane,
of Saxon origin, meant noble jewel. At
their next meeting Bill sought fight. A 1
polished the noble jewel’s every facet* and
“set” him, in mud, with a left chop that
would have split the Koh-i-noor in halves.
Over the post-stoush beer Bill demanded
to know Alastair’s second name. A 1 put
on his wry grin again. “Aw,” he
mumbled. “My old man was a regular in
the Royal Artillery. My second name’s
Lyddite! ”

“Miss Ecks”: We were picnicking by
the roadside when a modern limousine
slid to a standstill beside us, shortage of
oil its trouble. We obliged with a pint.
“That’s one thing about old buses like
yours,” mused the super-eight owner.
“One can always rely on their being oil-
eaters. I never pull up near a new model
when we’re running low in oil. Never
any carried to spare there." Perhaps he
did hear our comments, for the superior
glide-off of the eater-of-other-fellows’-oil
was practically noiseless,

“Pitt St.”: Anybody in search of proof
that continuous ballyhoo will attract a
city crowd could have found it at Sydney
Royal Show. The N.S.W. Railways had
dragged out and set up on rails what it
called a new carriage, of which so many
were being built for such-and-such rail
services. It was a very ordinary carriage
of the kind with which the people of
Victoria and South Australia have been
familiar for years open coach,
air-conditioning, movable seats and so
forth —and similar cars trundle about
N.S.W. But so great were the crowds to
"Mum told me to tell you we're both doing fine, Pop!"
see it that to be railed off, and
the through like sheep
through a race. And there was the inevit-
able Sydney touch in the vandal who
slashed the Upholstery, the inevitable
Sydney humorist who loudly said
“Wouldn’t it be beaut if a man could
ever get a seat in the thing!”

“Waddlin’ Willie”: Whisky rackets?
A “smart guy” in our squadron pioneered
the game with a Catalina unit. Regularly
his agent from down south sent him
empty Scotch bottles complete with label.
The bottles were promptly filled with
Australian whisky plus a nobbier of dry
sherry to give it. a “bite like the real
McCoy.” These he peddled from Darwin
to Manila, never working the same place
twice. After a long walk to a Yank camp
in the Philippines one night he offered
his “Scotch” for 25 dollars a bottle.
Try as he would he couldn’t make a sale.
They all wanted Australian!

“Pitoe”: The phenomenon “Suyic” re-
fers to (B. 10/3/’4B) is a common occur-
rence encountered when flying over any
part of the globe. Not only does the cir-
cular rainbow surround the shadow of a
plane on cloud during daylight hours, but
at night, with a good moon, a lunar effect
is sometimes there, though the colors
of the spectrum are not so vivid. The
best displays I have seen were when fly-
ing within about 30ft. of huge cumulus
clouds during the afternoon in northern
Queensland and at night in the tropics
above a layer of stratus with a full moon.
To a lesser degree the halo can be seen
when flying low over dew-drenched grass
in the early morning. These effects are
caused by the.rays of light being reflected
directly back from the condensed water-
vapor, exactly the same as the common
rainbow,

“C. 8.”: An interesting feature about
the latest important acquisition of the
Melbourne National Gallery, Murillo’s
“Immaculate Conception,” which hasn’t
been observed by the critics, is that the
principal figure is slightly cross-eyed. The
picture isn’t the best Murillo painted of
the subject. His acknowledged master-
piece in this direction, copied times out
of number by artists, is in the Louvre.
It is known all over Europe as “The
Cockeyed Virgin.” Modernists will no
doubt give some strange mystical inter-
pretation to the peculiarity and start mak-
ing their female portraits cockeyed,
though all it indicates is that Murillo, a
realist, used the same model for both his
pictures.

“Pinana”: Tell “Notis” (B. 10/3/’4B)
that, although a propeller to be fully effi-
cient has to have motion, there is sufficient
• “intake” into the partial vacuum created
by the whirling blades to enable the
smallest of propellers to produce thrust
even though the craft to which it is
attached may be motionless. A tug
hitched to a grounded steamer, if condi-
tions are at all favorable, will generally
win out. And hasn’t “Notis” ever
watched a plane take off? When aircraft
are revved-up on the ground, tremendous
brake pressure is required to prevent them
moving forward—and air is a lot thinner
than water.

“Eureka”: A woman who had been
living with her husband and several
children in a couple of rooms was over-
joyed when she discovered that she had
drawn a house in a Housing Commission
ballot —a brick house in a very nice
suburb. “I suppose the rent will be pretty
high,” a friend remarked. “Don’t be
silly,” the woman replied. “I won’t have
to pay rent. I won it in the ballot.”

“Pawang”: A psychiatrist said recently
that neurosis in Australia, and the world
in general, was on the increase. I doubt
it. What has probably happened is that
Freud and his friends have made us more
self-conscious of it. What the bored
young lady of a century ago used to call
the vapors is now given the pretentious
title of a manifestation of a father com-
plex, and the medical man who formerly
looked for physical causes and never
failed to find them is now beginning to
regard them as symptoms of something
deeper. Neurosis was probably as preva-
lent 2000 years ago as it is in the atomic
age. Plato gave a perfect description of
the negative transference in “The
Banquet” in the meeting between Socrates
and Alcibiades. Samuel Johnson was a
lamp-post toucher, and Zola, when he
stayed in England, felt impelled to pick
up every hairpin he passed in the street,
and if he thought he had missed one he
was thrown into an acute state of nervous-
ness until he went back for it. He ration-
alised his neurotic behavior by calling it
a statistical survey which would give him
valuable information about the character
of English ladies. But it was just as
neurotic as the behavior of an elderly
woman I often see who takes four steps
.back for every five .she takes forward,
and when she disappears into an arcade
causes intense astonishment by reappear-
ing walking backwards.

“Tajl”: That radar gadget mentioned
by “C. 8.” (B. 25/2/’4B) for locating faults
in telephone lines is,the war-time inven-
tion of a N.S.W. railwayman. Called the
electronic fault-locator, it is fitted into
a compact metal box about the size of a
mantel-model radio, and is portable. Its
operation is simple; on discovery of line
trouble the gadget is connected to the
wire and switched on. The obstruction,
whether a magpie’s nest or a fallen tree,
is plotted within five minutes to a place
within 100 yards of the actual break.

“Hukm Hai”: The Pakistan-India
problem must be largely aggravated by
the difficulty of inducing troops to sink
their differences while getting on with the
job of cleaning-up the mess. In Java
with an Indian brigade in 1946 I wit-
nessed what might have been a tidy little
Hindu-Mussulman set-to. A Mussulman
anti-tank regiment and a Gurkha bat-
talion in Central Java evacuating Dutch
and Chinese refugees were being supplied
by air-drop from Samarang. The first
drop was picked up by the Moham-
medans without incident, but on the next
day the Gurkhas had a sharp go-in with
“our Indernesian comrades,” losing two
or three men. The job completed, Johnny
Gurkha retired to his billet thinking
deeply, and, after much pondering, came
to the conclusion that (a) the anti-tank
regiment had got off scot-free because
they happened to be of the same religion
as our “comrades,”- and ( b ) they had
tipped-off the Indos concerning the fol-
lowing day’s drop. Great activity was
evident all night in the Gurkha lines, and
by dawn all their slit-trenches and
weapon-pits had been redug, and were
now sited to cover the anti-tank regi-
ment. Only prompt action by interfering
British officers prevented what promised
to be a merry little scrap,

“Ex 2/ 12th”: Aussie o.rs. on leave in
the Middle East often found the Tommy
officer very different from the frigid type
they’d read about. After El Alamein
the Ninth Division got five days’ Jerusalem
leave, and finding the ban on o.rs. lifted
at the swanky King David Hotel, one
lean, desert-scorched gunner took an
elaborate suite there. He found himself
surrounded mainly by Tommy majors
and above; also, incidentally, King
Farouk’s sister, the youthful black-eyed
Queen of Iran, plus large retinue in tar-
bushes and nighties. During a morning
spent happily gargling Tel el Eisa sand
from his larynx, the gunner set out across
the great marble-floored lounge, but
marble floors and heelplates don’t mix,
and after slithering wildly for several
yards he crashed heavily among the Court
of Iran and an imposing collection of
brasshats. “Topping three-point land-
ing, old boy,” said a casual voice as its
owner helped the gunner to his feet.
“Let’s go and have the other half.” And
the Tommy staff-officer and the A.I.F.
gurlner made a beeline for the bar. The
hangover from that long session has gone,
and Jewish terrorists have since blown
up the bar —but I can still feel that marble
floor.

“Shot-rope” goes down below:
Let me in with my queerest experience—four
fathoms down in Vaucluse Bay (Sydney). The
Navy trains its own divers, and that first dip
is never forgotten. After the suit is pulled on,
and your greased fingers thrust through each
tight rubber cuff, the 161 b. boots are laced on,
lifeline and knife secured and the helmet
lowered on to the breastplate, with due regard
for nose and ears. You’re on the ladder by
this, thinking what a slip would mean with
the helmet open. Then the glass face-piece
screws in; a tap on the dome and you clump
down the ladder. The cold water creeps up
thighs, back, then chest. An involuntary gasp
as it bubbles over your mouth and you’re
under, looking at the boat’s propellers. It
takes only a few seconds to pull yourself down
the shot-rope, and the instructor lumbers over
to take your hand. You let go the shot-rope,
and at once find yourself flat on your back on
the harbor bed. Too much air in the legs.
The instructor bends, adjusts your valve and
you come upright. Now you feel the crutch-
crushing weight of water —31b. per sq. in. for
every fathom of depth. Like dream-walkers,
slowly and lightly, you both step off, bent
almost double against a water resistance like
a 50-knot wind. A hole catches your boot.
The added pressure of the fall is enough to
squeeze air in the suit and dig a red-hot needle
in your ears. For 15 minutes you follow
the master, crawling on the bottom as when
entering a wreck, groping backwards on hands
and knees. Then back to the shot-rope through
the murk —contrary to Hollywood, visibility is
reduced to arm’s length under water —close the
air-valve slightly, and in a minute the suit fills
and you balloon gracefully to the surface and
the blessed light of day.

“Balander”: The police have never
found Australians anxious to inform as
to the whereabouts of wanted men, ex-
cept in extreme cases such as homicidal
maniacs and sex criminals. It must have
been a shock to the Comrades, there-
fore, to learn that when it became known
that one of their number, Rowe, had
been fined and sentenced to jail for con-
tempt by the Queensland Industrial
Court, and promptly “scrammed into
smoke,” police broadcasts of his appear-
ance were followed by continuous phone
calls from people who believed they’d
spotted him. Possibly no better evidence
is needed that Australians have had Com-
munists.

“Camp Hill”: M. H. Ellis, at the end
of his remarkable work on Macquarie,
notes that, although no national monu-
ment stands to the real founder of Aus-
tralia, his memory is perpetuated in the
rivers, lakes, streets and towns named
after him. Ellis might also have
added that there is a profusion of Lach-
lans, particularly along the river of that
name. Forbes, for instance, has its main
thoroughfare Lachlan-street, and may
still have its ■ Lachlan garage, cafe and
bakery; Condobolin has the “Lach-
lander” newspaper, is in the Lachlan
electorate and, like Cowra, has its share
of houses so named. But whether the
name is for the old Governor or his
short-lived son I leave to Mr. Ellis.
POETS ON THE CHAIN.
“The Communist Government of Czechoslovakia
has issued poets with a list of themes, outside of
which they are not permitted to go, and instructed
them as to what they must write about the forth-
coming elections.” •
Someone who plied the balladist’s vocation
Once mentioned that he didn’t care a curse
Who framed the laws and statutes for the nation
As long as he was free to make its verse.
But here’s a country where all that is altered;
Beneath the shadow of the Commo plague,
They’re fettered, hobbled and securely haltered,
The chaps who build the lofty rhyme in
Prague.
No winged Pegasus into the farness
Of fancy’s flight may there direct his course.
He’s got to trot obediently in harness,
What you might call a propaganda horse.
Poets may be the world’s true legislators,
As Shelley held, but should they dare to vex
Their bosses, they will risk the fate of traitors,
It seems, among the Slovaks and the Czechs.
Ho, brother, minstrels, you whose name is legion
Who smite the lyre and gather in the bunce
Therefor, give thanks you are not in the region
That wore the label of Bohemia once!
Your verses, throbbing with divine afflatus,
Wild as the waves lashed by the winter gales,
In that far land might earn for you no status
Excepting what’s obtainable in jails.
Think of it, Bellerive, you whose lyrics capture
My fancy whensoe’er they meet my gaze,
Where would you be without the careless rapture
That seems inseparable from your lays?
And you, purveyors of free verse et alia,
Whitman’s and Eliot’s literary pards,
Be thankful that you’re living in Australia
Free to indulge in all the Saturnalia
Sternly forbid to Czeoho-Slovak bards.

“Lord Luvus”: The Golden Rule got
an unusual twist from a matron who was
discussing the failings of a neighbor in a
tram in Melbourne. “Of course I believe
in the Bible,” she said while a dumb-
founded tramful listened. “It says I
should love her, and I do love her. But
it doesn’t say I should like her —and I
don’t like her.”

“Jasby”: Next Saturday the passenger-
liner Manunda leaves Sydney en route
for Fremantle on her first civvy job in
eight years. Before the war one of the
most popular vessels in the Australian
coastal trade, she went into wartime dress
and donned the Red Cross in May, 1940.
She made three trips to the Middle East
as a hospital ship, but for the greater part
of the war she operated in the Pacific
zone, getting all her share, and more, of
excitement and risk. She was in Darwin
when the first air-raid flattened the town
and filled up the harbor with sunken
ships; her own casualties from Nip
savagery were 12 killed and 58 wounded.
Later she figured in another action at
Milne Bay, but was more fortunate ; Jap
searchlights played on her, but she was
spared attack. After the Japanese sur-
render Manunda was the first Australian
ship to enter Singapore —she brought
home p.-0.-w, —and when the Occupation
Force sailed for Japan she took the 103rd
A.G.H. to Kure and acted as a base
hospital there until the shore establish-
ment was ready to function. In six years
Manunda covered close on a quarter of
a million miles, carried almost 15,000
patients and not far short of 8000 other
passengers. Captain J. Garden was in
command until the middle of 1944 ; from
then till she went out of commission in
July, 1946, Captain S. Webb had charge.
When she moves out from Darling
Harbor on Saturday reconditioned and
spick-and-span, her skipper will be
Captain V. L. Adie, who served in her
years ago as chief officer.

“Hep-2-3-4”; An Army quartermaster
swears by his F.2oo’s that it happened.
With a divisional inspection of stores
commencing in a week, he and an off-
sider checked through the gear in hand :
“ ‘Razors, safety 500’ —yes; ‘cases, bin-
ocular 50’ —yes ; ‘bottles, oil 320’ —yes ;
‘shov, wood 1’ —nope.” And although
that Q.M. could say offhand what a
“frogs, bay” was, he had to put a query
on his sheet. Later they went looking for
it The sigs hadn’t borrowed it, nor had
the mortars, but a bloke in the intelli-
gence section informed them that he’d
seen one before in another unit! He
drew them a plan, and they took it to
the .pioneers, hoping that if they used
“D.D.”-stamped wood the inspecting
officer might pass it. When it was finished
they took it to the cookhouse, rigged it
up and explained to the babs that its in-
genious telescopic arm ending in a claw
grip was for pushing wood under the
boilers. They then went back to their Q
| store and put a tick against the item.
When the inspecting officer, checking
their sheets, came to “shov, wood 1” he
asked to see it. They took him to the
cookhouse. “That’s not a ‘shoy, wood,’ ”
bellowed the old boy, “A ‘shov, wood
1’ is a wooden spade used for putting
sand on incendiary bombs. This thing is
a ‘holder clasp medical, troops for the
keeping still of.’ It’s used while giving
cholera injections. Take it to the
R.A.P.”

“Melbn”: I have been much intrigued
at the news that the Melbourne City
Council has bought a Rolls-Royce for the
Lud Mayor at a cost of £5OOO only to
discover that th/e .roof is too low to
accommodate Councillor Connelly in a
tophat or a general in a plumed one. If
the City Fathers had come to me I could
have sold them a car which would have
just suited the Lud Mayor. I bought it
from a funeral parlor for a modest £5O,
"No, no, Ronald! Mother will tell you when We get to the Zoo!"
although, in its vintage year—l924—it
was worth £ll5O. The immense height of
its ceiling would have permitted the civic
head to wear not just one tophat, but
tiers of them, thus adding considerably
to the dignity of his office. It rests in my
backyard and is available at a fiver.

“Catspaw”: The Royal yacht has gone
(B. 24/ 3/ ’4B), but there is one old craft
the R.N. will never scrap. H.M.S.
Victory, her timbers as staunch as the day
they were laid (except where a Nazi bomb
blew a hole in her bilges, but couldn’t
break her back), is being wholly re-rigged
in Portsmouth dry dock. A five-months
job, old documents, books and the ship’s
original rigging-warrant are being con-
sulted to ensure meticulous adherence to
detail. During the war her spars and top-
masts were sent down, and valuable relics
on board shipped to safety. The public,
of course, was excluded. Soon after the
surrender the tall masts and whipping
pendants flew again over the grey Fleet
berthed in Pompey basin, and hundreds
of thousands of sightseers have visited
Victory since. The main attraction
is still the spot where Nelson fell —
plus a splinter of the bomb that holed her.

catechism spiced with suspicion. With
permission grudgingly granted, and only
after she’d recalled that his confidential
typist was a vinegary lady of uncertain
age, his missus tartly informed him she
wasn’t going to stop in the house on her
own and that she’d probably be at a
neighbor’s place. Finishing earlier than
he had anticipated, the worker-backer
arrived in the suburb just as the crowd
was streaming in to the pictures, and he
decided to drop in, too. The show began
as he entered. ' Intermittent murmurs
from the seats in front gradually grew to
a steady yapping as one woman gave the
one beside her a running commentary of
the melodrama and the juicy bits that
were to come. Fed-up to the tonsils the
aggressive one at last leaned between the
two and hissed “Can’t you bags shut up
and let others enjoy the show?” The
twin gasps of indignation were followed
by frozen silence. When the lights went
up at interval the women turned round
with icy stares —it was his missus and the
woman next-door. In the Home Popu-
larity Stakes the aggressive one is now
leading German measles and Chifley

“Oliver Filter”: There were three of us
in the taxi —the driver and myself in the
front and a preoccupied chap in the
back. As he neared his destination the
back-seat passenger suddenly announced
“You’re a genial sort of chap, driver;
I’ve a proposition for you.” The sus-
picion with which Sydneysiders greet all
such remarks registered on the driver’s
phiz, but he waited. The speaker con-
tinued, “I’m the art director of Blintax
Advertising Company; we want some
photographs of a genial-looking fellow.
See me tomorrow and there’ll be a couple
of guineas in it for you.” The advertising
man paid his fare and got out; the driver
took me on my way almost exploding
with geniality. It may be my imagina-
tion, but almost every taxi-driver I’ve
seen since has been wearing an expansile
forced grin.

“Zake”: The pink - faced youth
wedged his way into one of those annoy-
ing phone-boxes —or half-boxes —out of
which his voice floated quite clearly.
After about five minutes the hard-dialled
bottled-blonde chewing gum in front of
me in the queue turned round, and, in
the matey way of the fellow-queuer,
jerked her thumb towards the phone-box
and said “Gosh, he takes long enough
makin’ an appointment with his sheilah.”
From waxing sarcastic as to the high
mush content in the calf-lover’s speech
she turned, as time marched on with no
sign of the conversation ending, to the
selfishness of public-phone users. Her
diatribe became stormier, and at the end
of about 10 minutes, when the young
fellow hung up the receiver and walked out
wearing a dreamy look, she glared at him
with a basilisk eye—and bounced bad-
temperedly into the box. Twenty minutes
later she backed out. “Migawd, it’s stuffy
in there,” she said as I moved up. “How
people can stop in a place like that to
mag more than they’ve got to beats me!”

“Dong”: A friend, who frequently
greets me with “Now I am completely
unsurprisable,” gets his doses of anti-
shockson teaching small boys in a fairly
lively suburb. Recently when he gathered
in the printed questionnaire he had issued
to his pupils he found on one, in reply
to Name of Mother? —“Miss Smith (So
what?).”

“Curtain Raiser”: Good Friday was
the 100th anniversary of “There Is a
Green Hill,” one of the world’s best-
Joved hymns and the particular bane of
my childhood, Cecil Frances Humphreys,
its author, was the daughter of Major
John Humphreys, who fought at Copen-
hagen. She married an Irish bishop, and
it was a hill outside Derry which inspired
the first line. In my Sunday-schooldays
I could never understand why a hill,
green or otherwise, should be noteworthy
for not possessing a city wall. I have
only recently discovered that Miss
Humphreys wasn’t responsible for my
perplexity; the editors of “Hymns A and
M” were. She wrote quite sensibly:
There is a green hill far away,
Outside a city wall.
They saw fit to go all literary, and left
a poser for generations of children by
making it “without a city wall.”

“M.H.”: Remarkable how nicknames
stick! Intermittently a rail-motor plies
from Clyde to Carlingford (N.S.W.), and
residents know it as the Packet. Back in
1789 the first vessel built in N.S.W. was
the Rose Hill (launched in the same area),
built by the convicts to meet the needs
of people on the Parramatta River. It
was dubbed the Packet, afterwards
changed to the Lump, which more
accurately designated its ungainliness.

“Plop”: I’d been getting shaky and
repeatedly dreaming about chewing-gum
—all night long I would strike the stuff
growing like petrified mushrooms on the
back of theatre seats, or find hard
nuggets of it studded on the underside
of restaurant tables. Tossing restlessly.
I’d doze off again, to rip the sole off my
dream-shoe by treading on a specimen
still in the pliable state. And then I
would grind my teeth fearfully when I
recalled the two flappers that I’d seen
walking along blowing small balloons
with a new variety which they would
then explode in a synchronised “smack”
and go on chewing, still looking deadly
serious. So I thought I ought to take a
holiday. After a week in the mountain
country of the South Coast all was for-
gotten, and I could look at any gum-tree
without a shudder. Near the end of my
stay I raced some other tourists up the
final 20 yards of a hill, and, reaching the
top, slapped my hand victoriously on its
rock-cairn summit, striking something
horribly familiar. Fastened to the rocks,
on a bleached cigarette-packet, with the
message; “Ha! ha! Beat you to it!
5/3/’4o—Miss J. 8.,” was a wad of gum
the size of a hen-egg. Conservatively I’d
say that female mountain-goat took 10
years off my life.

“W.P.T.”: Met a man at the races with
two of his pockets partly filled with pea-
nuts. He carried his money in these
pockets, and reckoned that no pickpocket
could get it from him —the crackling of
the peanuts would give him ample warn-
ing.

“Macnell”; The offensive armament
of a Norwegian whaler recently in Mel-
bourne suggests the whale hasn’t much
chance these days. The modem harpoon
is a deadly instrument, and embodies a
straight shaft of high-tensile steel, at itsi
thickest three to four inches through,
with a barbed neck behind an explosive
head. The pointed bomb penetrates the
whale, its fuse started, and five seconds
after hitting detonates with shattering
effect. Sometimes the charge kills in-
stantly, but more often it ensures a
greater burying effect of the barbs. The
harpoon line is a 6iin. manila coiled in
a huge bin. From the bin it leads up
through a wood-lined channel, to pre-
vent friction, up to a block on the fore-
mast, through and down over a winch-
drum, through a pulley abaft the gun on
the fo’c’sle, under the gun-platform and
out through a bow fairlead. The mast-
block is ingeniously fitted with steel
springs, and so the 50ft. mast is, in
effect, a springy rod with, for winder,
the powerful steam-winch on the fo’c’sle.
THE QUIZ GAME.
I sometimes wonder what the blazes is
The best equipment for the game of Quiz,
And who’s most likely to attain success
For comprehensive knowledgeableness
In this comparatively modem sport
Whereto a number hopefully resort,
Knowing appreciative flocks and herds
Of radio-listeners hang upon their words,
With cheers for those who carry home the casn
And murmured sympathy for such as crash.
f
Be sure, before you climb into the ring,
You’ve read “Inquire Within for Everything,
And hold yourself, whoever controverts,
A cyclopedia in pants —or skirts.
Yet things that are, along with things that were,
Should be included in your mental fare,
From Homer’s staves and Cleopatra’s capers
To what’s recorded in the morning papers.
Think what a range of knowledge must be his —
Or hers —who faces unperturbed a Quiz!
On paper pedagogues should do the best,
You’d think, in any educative test,
Recalling one at whom “the wonder grew
That one small head could carry all he knew,”
As Goldsmith tells, but though invincible
At history, geography as well,
One may suspect that quite a lot may be
Undreamed about in their philosophy
When worldly interrogatories whiz
From some abrupt announcer in a Quiz.
They meet in conference* the teams of chaps
Selected for these intellectual scraps,
I’m told, to supplement each other’s store
Of scientific terms and classic lore,
Firmly neglecting nothing that relates
To places and quotations, names and dates.
But what’s the use when anyone may meet
A query utterly outside his beat?
However much you know, that surely is
The ever-lurking danger in a Quiz.

This big variety chain-store organisa-
tion consists of the parent and seven sub-
sidiaries, one of which is a property co.
Together they operate over 100 stores
scattered throughout the Commonwealth
and Maoriland. The rapid expansion and
extraordinary financial success of the
group during the between-wars period,
and its very satisfactory performance
under war-time restrictions and handi-
caps, have made the scrip one of the most
popular and, relatively, highly-priced
stocks on the market.
The parents paid capital went up with
a rush from £63,264 in 1928 —when the
public became interested—to £1,388,999
in 1939. Of the increase no less than
£944,712 represents bonus scrip, and the
remaining £381,020 brought with it
£199,977 of share premiums. Then war
called a halt to expanding retail turn-
overs, and the capital account remained
steady until 1946, when managing-
director W. T. Kelly was allotted
10,000 ss. ords, at a premium
of 15s. each. To finance present growing
turnover 1,116,499 new ss. ords. were
issued, one-for-four at par, early last
term —the price at which new issues are
put out is today a matter for the Capital
Issues Committee, which has never clearly
stated its policy, and whose decisions have
perplexed investors and co. directors
alike. The co.’s paid capital has thus
reached £1,670,624 in 75,000 first 10 p.c.
and 200,000 second 7 p.c. cum. prefs., all
of £1 each, and 5,582,495 ords. of ss.
each.
And shareholders’ experience in the
matter of divs. has been a happy one,
too. For the four generally difficult slump
years to 1934 distributions averaged 26.1
p.c., followed by an average of 16.6 p.c.
for the eight years to 1941, and then the
average dropped to 11.9 p.c. for the five
years of war-time scarcities to the close
of accounts in 1946. During this last-
mentioned period the hunger of the tax-
gatherer grew and prices and costs
climbed, and have continued to do so
since. However, as more goods trickled
into the market turnover expanded, to
the benefit of net earnings, and the div.
was lifted from 12 p.c. in 1946 to 16 p.c.
(2 p.c. of it was labelled Victory bonus)
in 1947, and 15 p.c. was paid on the
increased capital last term.
No time was lost in finding profitable
employment for the new capital, which,
together with surplus earnings, etc., went
into stocks (up £290,269), shares in other
cos. (up £38,214), book debts (up £17,482),
cash (up £49,006) and plant (up £21,040).
Stocks, now 131 p.c. above the 1940 level,
catch the eye ; but they consist, for the
most part, of inexpensive, quick-selling
lines, thus removing much of the danger
inherent in prices recessions. Moreover,
experience shows that in bad times many
who ysed to pass by the co.’s shops turn
in. Finances are comfortable, and
always have been:

The year’s improvement in the more-or-
less liquid surplus (£2,559,638) was
£399,775, due mainly to introduction of
fresh capital.
Goods came forward in better volume
last term, and turnover responded, thus
cushioning the bump from rising costs.
The spring in net earnings was £35,691,
lifting the figure to £305,923, which in-
cludes £5OOO tossed from somewhere into
reserves. That was after allowing £28,635
(up £1447) for depreciation and paying
tax assessments (£55,712, up £32,171) re-
ceived in respect of previous earnings.
The £305,923 is therefore subject to taxa-
tion, for which no specific provision has
been made. It covered the pref. divs.
and 20.3 p.C. on ord. capital as against
22.3, 14.9, 13.5, 13.9, 11.3, 20.8 and 23.4
p.c. back to 1941. The £75,080 that re-
mained after paying divs. lifted reserves
£808,997 in excess of goodwill (£165,227).
In addition there is £384,653 (up £21,734)
reserved for depreciation and £7500 ear-
marked for deferred maintenance, as well
as the staff fund, £40,500.
Since the beginning of 1948 the ords.
have fluctuated between 255. Id. and
235. 6d. in the market. At the lower
figure the return is 3.2 p.c, on a 15 p.c.
div. basis. Net tangible cover is 7s. Bd.
per share, excluding depreciation reserve,
etc. The first prefs. at 435. and the
seconds at 31s. 6d, yield 4.6 p.c. and
4.4 p.c. respectively. They are well pro-
tected for both capital and dividends.

The recent attack by Mr. Gollan in the
N. S. Wales Parliament upon this co. was
made in either ignorance or recklessness.
What was overlooked was that in some
instances an assured person might elect
to take a diminished death benefit for the
advantage of securing an increased
maturity benefit. Instead of taking, say,
a straightout contract for £4O, death’ or
maturity, the assured, convinced of sur-
viving the maturity date of the policy,
voluntarily contracts for payment of, say,
£5O on maturity, but alternatively agrees
to take £25 in the event of prior death.
Premiums payable are the same in both
cases.
It is this type of contract, which has
been issued at one time or another by
most life offices, that Mr. Gollan quite
wrongly assailed as unjust. Owing to the
high cost of collecting premiums on in-
dustrial policies, the benefits obtained
therefrom are nothing like the benefits to
be had from ordinary contracts. For this
reason it is desirable that Industrial policy-
holders should transfer to the Ordinary
branch as soon as they are able to main-
tain payment of quarterly, half-yearly or
annual premiums. Nevertheless, Indus-
trial assurance does confer definite bene-
fits upon the assured, and it meets the
needs of the lower-income group.
The 26-year-old A.C.A, has given a
good account of itself, and continues to
strengthen its position. Premiums come
approximately one-quarter from Ordinary
and three-quarters from Industrial con-
tracts, with a small amount of general
business, as is shown in the following
dissection of last year’s total income:

General .. .. 3,525 37 3,562
£425,557 £104,003 £529,560
The growth in net premiums was £39,807
and in interest and rents, etc., £s49—the
small increase in the lastmentioned item
was due to a drop of £4103 in net rents
(£32,805). Total income was £40,356
stronger. In addition, there was a profit
of £1272 on sale of securities and a net
unexplained addition of £322 to sundry
reserves, which totalled £29,361.
The business is spread throughout all
the Australian States except Tasmania,
and in the life section policyholders are
entitled to £9 for every pound earned
for shareholders. Last year policyholders
received 92.7 p.c. of the distributable sur-
plus. Bonuses to policyholders have
flowed at moderate rates since the end of
the first decade, arid over the same period
shareholders received an annual 7 p.c.
(£1023 last term). Certainly bonus rates
are not what they used to be, but that is a
common experience due to factors out-
side the management’s control. Last
year rates were Ordinary 225. p.c. whole-
life and 15s. p.c. endowment, and Indus-
trial mainly 12s. p.c. whole-life and Bs.
p.c. endowment.
The amount of new business written
during the year was £1,265,779 —
£735,121 Industrial and £530,658 Ordinary.
A pleasing feature is that more attention
is now being given to Ordinary business.
After paying all legitimate claims and
exes., £159,332 was added to the life
fund, raising it to £2,447,834. - On a 3£
p.c, net premium basis actuary W. J.
Dowd figured liabilities under policies,
etc. —the etcetera includes special actu-
arial reserves designed to strengthen the
basis of valuation—at £2,430,811. The
surplus was thus £17,023, of which
£15,779 was distributed in bonuses to
policyholders, £1023 in divs. to shares
holders, and £221 was carried forward.
The gross return on mean life funds
was £4 6s. 9d. p.c., and the net return
(after deducting taxation, etc., £12,491)
was £3 16s. 10d., which gives a margin of
little over one-quarter of one p.c. be-
tween the actual and assumed rates of
earning; and the rate of net earning is
likely to shrink a little yet. Excluding
taxes, the overall expense rate was 30.6
p.c. of net premiums.

Last term mortgages were reduced by
£150,678 and £147,575 was added to
Government securities and £120,498 to
shareholders, which are a sound lot and
worth considerably more than book
value at current market prices. When
the books closed assets totalled £2,605,739,
and liabilities (other than under policies)
amounted to £ll3,933,Teaving net assets
of £2,491,806 to cover an assurance fund
(which more than covers liabilities under
policies) of £2,447,834. Shareholders,
therefore, could see the whole of their
capital intact and £29,362 besides.

The table certainly endorses chairman
H. G. Taubman’s brief comment that
turnover in 1947 was “an outstanding
record.” But last year’s profit must also
have benefited considerably from the re-
moval of War-time (Co.) Tax; no details
of taxes or other expenses are published,
and it is possible that the declared
£163,742 has been credited with War-time
tax provided unnecessarily for a portion
of the preceding term. In any case it is
a striking performance. After paying the
preference div., the declared figure repre-
sents 39.2 p.c. on ord. capital, compared
with 22.5 p.c. and 16.5 p.c. in the two
previous terms.
Taubman’s accounts command special
interest because the co. is practically
alone among the big Australian paint-
makers in having its shares publicly listed
—although it is now, like many of the
others, financed to a large extent with
British capital. In 1930 more than half
its ordinary shares were bought by
Pinchin, Johnson and Co., an English
paint organisation with paid capital of
£2.6 million. Taubmans had begun as a
small family business in 1902 and thrived
in face of keen competition. Rapid pro-
gress has continued since 1930, when
capital stood at £149,103. All the Aus-
tralian and N.Z. interests of Pinchin,
Johnson including Borthwicks and
William Dockers —have been taken over
as subsidiaries ; economies in administra-
tion were introduced and the range of
products widened.
Last term a section of the Common-
wealth Explosives Factory at Villawood
(N.S.W.) was bought to allow expansion
into the production of insecticides and
special chemical lines. As a result, fixed
assets rose by £156,545:

Since the close of accounts a bonus issue
of 40,642 £1 ords. and a cash issue of
121,923 at a premium of 255. each have
raised paid capital to £668,982, of which
£lOO,OOO is in 5 p.c. prefs.
Transport hitches, shortages of linseed
oil, and, more particularly, of tinplate
for containers are the main worries of
paintmakers at present. A steady im-
provement in recent months has prompted
the N. S. Wales Government to relax
some of its prohibitions on the use of
paint for “nonressential” purposes, but a
very large unslaked demand remains.
Both costs and selling-prices are much
higher than pre-war, although a recent cut
in some lines (decreed by Canberra) sug-
gests that further benefits are possible as
frictions on the productive side disappear.
The efficient Taubman business should
continue to enjoy a full share of the pre-
sent sellers’ market, and its widening
scope helps to insure the more distant
future. The co. recently established
a subsidiary in the U.S. to watch
for new fields and methods of produc-
tion—matters in which it has already been
served by its British associations.
At 86s. the £1 ords., which have
net tangible cover of 40s. Bd. each, yield
3.5 p.c. on the basis of the last 15 p.c.
dividend. The prefs. (backing £l2 11s.
6d.) yield 3.9 p.c. at 255. 9d. each.

No definite date for resump-
tion of dredging can yet be
given. The co. has three proper-
ties, two in Siam (Bhuket Island
and Ronpibon) and one in
Malaya (Bidor), each equipped
with a bucket dredge. The one
at Bidor has been refloated and
put into dry dock, pending de-
livery of replacements. Claims
(amount not stated) covering
loss and damage have been
lodged with the authorities.
In Siam changes in Govern-
ment and the disturbed state of
the country have delayed re-
habilitation. Co. has applied for
repossession of its 1 properties,
subject to peaceful possession
and finance for reconstruction
being made available. Under
the Peace Treaty the Govern-
ment had to restore the co.’s
property in pre-war condition.
Lack of materials and skilled
labor made this impracticable,
and the co. is negotiating for a
cash payment to cover cost of
the work, which it will carry out
itself. The Ronpibon dredge
cannot set-in until coal, unob-
tainable at an economic price at
the moment, is obtainable; so
the Government is being urged
to open-up a near-by deposit of
the stuff,
A rehabilitation loan of
£11,496 has been obtained from
the Malayan Government, re-
payable over 15 years from
1950, with interest at 3 p.c. p.a.
Also, £24,022 out of a claim for
£27,297 for tin-ore mined during
the occupation has been received
from the Siamese Government,
and £10,210 has been received
in settlement of the co.’s contri-
bution to the Siam tin-buffer
stock.

Broken Hill Prop.
Essington Lewis last week
# told the Australian Institute of
Metals that B.H.P. had in hand
a vast project for the production
of hot and cold strip, as well as
tinplate, at the Australian Iron
and Steel plant. Port Kembla
(N.S.W.). The strip mill would
be capable of processing over
a million tons of ingots a year,
and it involves almost the doub-
ling of the present A.I, and S.
steel mill. Hot-rolled strip in
widths up to 60in. will be pro-
duced, in thicknesses down to a
twentieth of an inch. The cold-
rolling mill will be used primarily
for the further processing of strip
into tinplate, but it can also be
used for rolling sheet products.
Plans and specifications have
been received from the United
States, and a start has already
been made on the site. Concur-
rently, development of Yampi
iron-ore deposits is proceeding,
12,500-ton ore-carriers are being
built, and a major reorganisa-
tion of the A.I. and S. collieries
on the N.S.W. south coast is
going on at a cost of £4 million.
Another large coal-screening
plant is expected to start work at
Port Kembla this year. Coal
is the key to the industrial situ-
ation today, said Mr. Lewis,
adding that the time was not far
distant when practically all coal
required by the steel industry
would be machine-won. B.H.P.
steelworks at Newcastle were
probably more self-contained
than any in the world.
The tinplate and strip mills
will cost a very large sum,
though no estimate was given by
Mr. Lewis. It is likely that over
£lO million will be required to
finance the programme, quite
apart from the coal-mechanisa-
tion expenditure. Perhaps a
subsidiary will be floated to look
after the rolling-mill and tinplate
section of the undertaking; but
in any case it seems that share-
holders will be asked for con-
siderably more capital in the
near future. At present B.H.P.
has an issue of 13,885,012 fully-
paid £1 ords.
Prices
The prices position, internally
and overseas, becomes daily
more involved. Two chief fac-
tors are concerned: On the one
hand, costs and credit inflation
show little sign of abating—
though higher living and hous-
ing costs in some countries are
starting to absorb savings—
while, on'the other, production
of some agricultural and pastoral
items, notably wheat, is promis-
ing to become adequate within
the next 12 months. It is from
such developments that the U.S.
wheat market has lost strength
since the beginning of the year,
this weakness in turn influencing
wool and some other raw-
material prices. But there isn’t
much evidence yet that produc-
tion-costs in the manufacturing
industries are starting to fall;
and it is only while there are
profit-margins to allow for com-
petitive price-reductions that in-
dustry will not be severely dis-
tressed by a combination of
high or rising costs and falling
prices.
One manufactured line that
appears to be rapidly ap-
proaching full production over-
seas is glassware. Though the
Australian industry is slow to
recover, British, Swedish and
Czechoslovakian crystal-ware is
in plentiful supply in Australian
shops, but still at high prices.
Shortages of manufactured
goods, in the main, remain the
rule, however, and this is likely
to be so for at least a couple of
years in some lines. It is prob-
able that full production of dif-
ferent types of goods will be
achieved in varying lengths of
time, and that steel products
and building materials will be
scarce for a good while yet. But
however long or short the time
it is going to take to get back
to adequate production of
goods and services, we can ac-
cept it as a fact that pre-war
prices for the majority of things
have gone for ever. A new
kind of money, of lower value,
has come to us during and since
the war.
Sugar Logistics
C.S.R. statements indicate that
the Queensland strike ended just
in time to save the southern
States from a sugar famine. As
it is there will be shortages for
some weeks, since about 150,000
tons of sugar is banked up at
"Oh Well , dear, he'll get a rebate off his income tax for
her, anyhow."
Queensland ports and mills, and
sugar ships, barred from
Queensland sugar ports by the
Communist-run wharfies’ and
seamen’s unions despite the
Commonwealth Shipping Board,
the Stevedoring Industry Com-
mission and every other Com-
monwealth “authority” from
the Prime Minister down, have
been put to other work.
But the end of the rail strike
—the Communist Healy was
shouting that the wharf strike
would go on until Premier
Hanlon withdrew his anti-strike
measures—isn’t the end of sugar
worries. The growers’ and
millers’ associations are greatly
perturbed by the 1948 harvest
prospects. There is a shortage
of labor for cutting, which is
a serious enough threat on its
own ; add to that the 1947 sugar
still cramming mill and wharf
stores on the sugar coast and
the new cane season barely two
months away.
Nobody seems to know a way
out, and, the demands of hungry
Britain notwithstanding, it’s
obvious that, even if enough
men can be raked up to cut the
1948 cane, most of the sugar will
have to be added to the 150,000
or so tons from 1947 still in the
sheds, which alone represents
about £3, lying idle.
This is no sudden position.
It has been growing with in-
creasing rapidity since the war,
the cumulative effect of the
slower and slower turn-round
of ships. During the 1947
season average weekly amount
shipped from sugar ports was
9000 tons —the mills produce
three times as much per week
—and the 1948 crop is expected
to be 200,000 greater than the
1947 one.
The slow-down of ship-load-
ing is shown clearly enough in
the fact that whereas there was
a bigger tonnage of sugar ship-
ping in 1947 than in 1939, the
total of 1947 cargoes was much
smaller than in 1939:
In 1939, 231 ships of 475,000 tons
deadweight capacity lifted 8,900,000
tons. In 1947, 187 vessels with a
d.w.c. of 669,000 tons lifted only
8,400,000 tons.
These figures, startling though
they are, mean nothing to Can-
berra, where the Golden Age is
just “around the corner” and
where nobody goes short of
sugar, even if Government
trucks have to be sent out for
it. But they mean something to
an industry which prevents
northern Queensland from be-
coming as empty as the N.T.,
and they suggest what that
industry must do is to seek some
means of bulk-handling the stuff
so that it can be poured into
ships’ holds like wheat,

On the proposed Comtex paid
capital of £74,500, last year’s
earnings would represent slightly

Sydney Waste Industries was
formed in 1939 by Paul Haege,
R. T. Evans and the late Stirling
Henry. It collects and sorts tex-
tile waste, and, in addition,
manufactures flock and wad-
ding and woollen wastes. Oper-
ations are still being expanded.
Sydney Condenser Yarns was
formed in April, 1947, for the
purpose of processing better-
class waste material, and a spin-
ning unit has been installed. The
co. owns all the shares in
Federal Cotton Co. Pty., which
manufactures large quantities of
engineers’ waste.

LONDON AIRMAIL
From Herbert Holman
End of Winter
While Britons could hardly
blame the Kremlin for the fierce
cold winds and heavy falls of
snow which decisively marked
the end of winter, at least they
were reminded that nothing good
can be expected from the direc-
tion of Russia. This cold spell
—happily as brief as it was
severe—only served to em-
phasise the mildness of the
winter as a whole. Thanks to
steady sou’-westerlies and especi-
ally to their welcome tendency
to prevail, there were no severe
fuel crises, no unavoidable in-
dustrial setbacks and no dis-
tressingly bad weather. For
once, it seems, Britain has had
a much-deserved “break.”
Spring, with warm sunshine
and glorious mildness, came in
as quickly as winter vanished.
Londoners, family-strong and
in great force, eagerly sought
the green parks and commons
at week-ends. True to tradition,
the daffodils at Kew Gardens
and the crocuses at Hampton
Court were the main attractions.
In fact, the louses were so
crowded with long-distance pas-
sengers that those who didn’t
live within walking distance
• couldn’t hope to be picked up.
It is clear that motorists
whose cars are laid up because
of petrol restrictions are loath
to give up the pleasure of their
accustomed week-end jaunts.
The result is that the lately-
nationalised public - transport
services have to take the extra
strain. With the summer
weather, this strain may well be
so considerable that the Govern-
ment will be forced seriously
to consider the reallocation of
basic petrol. At least, that is
what motorists are thinking—
and with a confidence that ex-
tends beyond the haze of mere
wishful thinking.
North Croydon By-election
The Conservative-party or-
ganisation has now proved it-
self to be every bit as strong
and as efficient as the Labor-
party machine. Much progress
has been made in the few
months following the Gravesend
by-election in November, 1947,
when the full force of the Labor
machine was pitted against a
band of local volunteers. The
narrow defeat depressed Con-
servative circles and suggested
that a little more effort might
have won the day.
But there was good staff-work
as well as energy in the cam-
paign at North Croydon, where
the Conservative man was re-
turned with a huge majority.
For an expected close fight
Labor policy has been to nomi-
nate a “star” candidate of
national fame and long political
experience and then to back
him up with an all-out cam-
paign. The Conservative central
office has been criticised because
many of its candidates were
local men of distinction who
were not practised in electioneer-
ing and, therefore, not up to
the task. It is argued in defence
that the candidate is chosen by
the local organisation. The
central office advises, but can-
not direct; the most it can do is
to turn down a man who, be-
cause of fuller information, is
known to be unsuitable. More-
over, given other qualities, poli-
tical inexperience is not neces-
sarily a disadvantage.
At North Croydon (which,
broadly speaking, bears a simi-
lar relationship to London as
does Burwood to Sydney) the
selection-committee did not ape
the Socialists and give fame the
first consideration in their
choice. The candidate, F, W.
Harris, is local by residence,
education, business and by
marriage.
One very significant fact
emerges from a study of the
campaign. The “middle-of-the-
road” elector, whose support
swayed the 1945 general election
and gave the Socialists an abso-
lute majority, seems to be
swinging the other way. It has
beep noticeable in recent by-
elections that these voters,
though they may have lost faith
in the present Government,
have been chary of giving their
support to the Conservatives,
This important cross-section is
comprised mainly of Liberals
(now without effective represen-
tation) and countless business
and professional men and
women who feel that the nation’s
recovery, not party politics, is
the prime consideration.
In times of less gravity the
popularity and distinction of
the Liberal . candidate, Austra-
lian-born Air Vice-Marshal D.
C. T. Bennett, would have won
him many votes outside the
considerable Liberal support
that he could have expected.
The circumstances of his dis-
missal from the British South
American Airways Corporation
brought him publicity and much
sympathetic interest; and his
war record could not fail to
appeal to the residents of a dis-
trict in the famous “Bomb
Alley.” Of the three candidates,
“Pathfinder” Bennett was the
one whose autograph was most
eagerly sought.
Yet he polled less than a tenth
of the total of 67,057 votes, and
4393 fewer than the Liberal in
the 1945 election.
In Harold Nicolson, well-
known diplomat, politician and
writer, Labor had a candidate
who seemed certain to attract
the middle-class vote. A pro-
fessed moderate and an open
admirer of Mr, Churchill, he
insisted on conducting the cam-
paign in his own way, refusing
to toe a party line. His tally of
24,536 was only 1726 more than
the Socialist candidate in 1945.
Mr. Harris, 33-year-old com-
pany director of a food-products
business, advocates equal oppor-
tunity for ail and believes in
trade-unions. He practises the
Conservative Industrial Charter
in the running of his own com-
pany, where bonuses are given
as reward for initiative and
extra effort. Men and women
have equal pay, subject to out-
put, and promotion is by merit
alone. He is widely travelled
and Empire-conscious, with
practical schemes for large-scale
Empire development, particu-
larly in the production of food.
He is, in short, an example of
private enterprise, new-style.
Harris was returned with a
majority of 11,664 and polled
12,793 more votes than did the
successful candidate in 1945,
when the Conservative majority
was only 607.
Threescore Years and Ten
Is a man too old for business
at 70?
The automatic retirement of
directors at age 70, as laid down
in the Companies Act, 1947
(due to come into force on July
1, 1948), is' not likely to cause
any dislocation in the board-
rooms of commercial and in-
dustrial Britain. In July, 1945,
a high-powered committee, pre-
sided over by Lord Justice
Cohen, presented a unanimous
report on their two-year inquiry
into the whole business of com-
pany law. Since then, limited-
liability companies have known
what was coming and have
shaped their policy accordingly.
Although the age-limit is
fixed by the Act at 70, a com-
pany can , alter its articles of
association to provide for any
retiring-age it likes, whether 40
or 100; and if a man over 70
is considered to be of excep-
tional value he can continue in
office by ordinary resolution,
subject to special notice being
given.
Anyhow, dodderers and
“gilded incompetents” are not
to be found in present-day in-
dustry, where it is usual for
senior executives and technicians
to be appointed as directors.
The Act lays down a prin-
ciple rather than hard-and-fast
rules. It is a principle that is
naturally welcomed by the
younger men, who point out
that there are many men over
70 who are not dodderers but
who, by sitting tight, cause able
and active executives to hang
back and wait for dead-men’s
shoes.

SUNDRY SHOWS
"The Guinea Pig."
Like the after-dinner speaker
who promises not to make a
speech, but does, Sydney
Minerva’s current play, “The
Guinea Pig,” promises not to
be a sermon, but is. Its text is
that English public-school edu-
cation should be available to de-
serving children who can’t
afford it, and its illustration, is
the case of a tobacconist’s son
who is awarded a bursary to en-
able him to attend Saintbury
School. Despite-the rather fan-
tastic opposition of his house-
master he manages, with the
assistance of a more human
teacher, to establish himself at
the school.
The author, Warren Chetham-
Strode, has a fair enough case,
but it Would be better argued in
a teacher’s college or from a
soap-box than from the stage,
particularly when he drags in
Such ancient melodramatic de-
vices as having his guinea pig
blamed for getting a girl from
a near-by school into trouble
when it was really the prefect,
an allegedly modern . public-
school product, who did the dirty
deed.
Trader Faulkner, as the
guinea pig, plays his part in the
business naturally enough, except
in the early scenes when he
stands before his housemaster
like a paralysed chook. Peter
Bathurst offers a reasonable por-
trait of a headmaster, but the
rest of the cast —Kathleen
Robinson, Jessica Noad, Richard
Parry, John Sykes, Richard
Sherren and Margaret and Wil-
liam Raynor —carry their loads-
with such intense seriousness
that half the time it is impos-
sible not to visualise them orat-
ing from a stump or debating
across a classroom.
Goodbye to Music.
If Sumner Locke - Elliott’s
“Goodbye to the Music,” put
on by Melbourne’s National
Theatre, is anything, it is a senti-
mentalised version of Margaret
Kennedy’s “Constant Nymph.”
There is a Dodd who allows love
to water-down his interest in his
music, and there is a Tessa who
comes into his life at the criti-
cal moment and awakens his
artistic conscience. There is a
Mrs. Dodd who represents
suburban values, and there is
even a Joe Bernstein and a girl
who marries him for money.
The subsidiary characters in
Miss Kennedy’s book are more
or less paralleled by the collec-
tion of boarding-house types
Mr. Locke-EUiott deploys to
give comic relief to his drama.
While Miss Kennedy used an
attack of pneumonia to get rid
of Tessa, Mr. Locke-Elliott’s
Tessa voluntarily walks out of
the picture when she has put the
ineffectual young musician on
the right path.
The only thing lacking in Mr.
Locke-Elliott’s drama is the one
thing that gives significance to
Miss Kennedy’s story the
genius of Sanger. In the absence
of Sanger Mr. Locke-Elliott’s
opus wanders about in mid-air
and is much less like life than
a Henry Moore sculpture is like
Nature.
Doris Fitton’s Independent
Theatre is always willing to put
on a new play, modern, classical
or home-brewed, although—
rightly, considering the theatre’s
almost solitary position as a
purveyor of the world’s drama-
tic goods to Sydney—the em-
phasis is on those plays with a
tendency to provoke cerebration.
The latest production, Joseph
Field’s “Doughgirls,” would not,
however, seriously tax the im-
agination of a juke-box. The
play is light, bright and ephem-
eral. There remains the plea-
sure of seeing the cast handle
the technical difficulties of the
production, wrestle with the
idiom and, on the whole, get all
that the play has to offer. It
will be a pleasure to see, par-
ticularly, Frank O’Donnell,
Margaret Christiansen and Enid
Lorimer in more exacting and
rewarding roles.
* * * *
Apart from certain crudities
and a scenic background that
seemed to have come out of a
child’s Noah’s Ark, the Theatre
Guild’s production of “Twelfth
Night” at the Melbourne Reper-
tory Theatre, Middle Park, was
slightly better than average pro-
fessional standards. Generally,
the lines were felt rather than
elocuted, and this was probably
because the amateurs assembled
were more concerned with their
content than their literary form.
Even the nervousness of the ac-
tors had its value —Dorothy
Harding fluttered about the
stage as the lovelorn Olivia in a
manner that was quaintly realis-
tic. The late Allan Wilkie made
Malvolio a symbol; Hugh
Neville, possibly because he was
obviously self-conscious, made
him far more human. Mostyn
Wright, as Sir Toby, was near
enough to perfect, and Howard
Charlton’s Aguecheek ran him
a good second.
* * * ♦
In his farewell recital at Syd-
ney Town Hall on Saturday
night lyric tenor John Fullard
surprised everyone, probably in-
cluding himself, with the volume
of sound he wrung from “Sound
an Alarm,” from Judas Macca-
baeus. Many a heavier voice
has done less justice in the same
hall to these heroic declamatory
passages of Handel. “I Will
Not Grieve” was an example of
excellently - restrained lieder.
Mr. Fullard’s flexible and easily-
produced tenor shows up to best
advantage, however, ip the lyric
opera arias. He could be a dis-
tinct asset in such roles as
Rudolfo, the Duke of Mantua
and Faust. Such lighter airs as
“Don’t Be Cross,” “Santa Lucia”
and “Girls Were Made to Love
and Kiss” the singer found
easier than shelling peas, and if
his interpretation of them rather
savors of the late Richard
Tauber’s —well, who could wish
for a better exemplar?
"Slap Dat Fiddle."
When performers at a “jazz
contest” were untied recently at
Sydney’s Town Hall and
“trotted on to the platform like
footballers entering the field” a
few of the old school of music-
lovers, present as a recce
party, were amazed to learn
that “Thrash me, mumma, with
a solid five” is part of the jargon
of jazz. When they saw mem-
bers of the audience “getting
hepped” in the aisles they had
to agree with the usher who
said “It isn’t quite like the old
days.”
Although the Town Hall’s
establishment of pigeons is now
boarding with friends at the
G.P.O. until their own building
settles back on its foundations,
the Big Barn appears to be good
for a year or two yet. The recce
party agreed that the jazz ses-
sion certainly had it jumping,
and observed that anyone who
could be “sent” by it should be
really “slammed” by a good
symphonic concert.

Hollywood has 1 been purveying
both sides of music for some
time. In the latest effort, “Three
Daring Daughters” (Sydney St.
James), Jos6 Iturbi flits between
musical extremes like a welter-
weight musical butterfly, suffer-
ing no apparent indigestion. For
his music he earns applause ; for
ever entangling himself with
three such damsels he should be
impaled on a clarinet.

“Kiss of Death” (Sydney

ment.

“The Secret Behind the Door”
(Sydney Victory); Having been
dropped on his cranium or some-
thing as a youngster, Michael

some murders have been com-
mitted. Joan Bennett marries
him and rids him of his grem-
lins.

“Jassy,” at Sydney Esquire, is
a kaleidoscope of color, swag-
gering squires, faithless ladies
and bad Hollywood. Margaret
Lockwood has had a change of
heart, and is as guileless as a
glass of milk. Squire Basil Syd-
ney, never without his riding-
crop, swings it against man and
maid alike with the same easy
carelessness as a sailor swings
the lead. Dennis Price loses his!
manor at cards with less fuss
than losing a pencil, and Miss
Lockwood regains it for her
tardy lover with about the same
degree of emotion. All ends
well, with a murder charge
beaten by the timely testimony
of Miss Lockwood’s faithful
serving wench, Esme Cannon.
Esme turns in the best acting—
she is dumb.
“The Man I Love” (Sydney
Empire): Ida Lupino, excellent
actress though she is, seems to
be landing in some dreadful con-
coctions. In this current opus,
as a hard-headed blues-singer,
she takes time off to fix her
sister’s marriage, a neighbor’s
domestic affairs, her young
brother’s wayward habits and
sundry other pother, including a
sleek night-club owner, before
wandering out of the piece with
a tearful grin because she can’t
fix her own romance with piano-
player - cum - merchant-seaman.
The supporting film, “The Were-
wolf’s Uncle,” or some similar
ghostly title, has the momentary
saving grace of a terrified negro
whose “feet refuse to stand
around while mah body is
abused.”

tinted drawings of native girls,
Borneo landscapes and soldiers
in bar-rooms, some of which
appear to be memory-sketches.

Women’s Letters
From Sydney
Crowds of country visitors, the
Wallabies, Cicely Courtneidge and
Madame Rambert went to the late-after-
noon party given at Government House
during race-week. Elizabeth Northcott
helped her father to receive the guests.
Sister Mrs. Donald Coburn and her
husband were also on deck. Everybody
agreed the party was fun. Another late-
aftemoon do still being spoken about was
that given by the Union Club to its
women friends. They say there were over
1000 amiably jostling around the sacred
precincts. Then there was the Matrons’
Ball. Forty-two hostesses and about 450
guests made up the colorful display at
the Royal Sydney Golf Club. It takes
women to grasp the true economics of
the times. With 42 hostesses a party for
450 doesn’t bring anyone to the verge
of bankruptcy. A party run on those
lines is sound commonsense.
Helen Keller, the magnificent, arrived
in Sydney last week, and this city im-
mediately took to its heart this clear-
skinned, vivacious woman who, though
she became blind and deaf and dumb in
childhood through an illness, refused to
be overwhelmed by fate. Instead she
has become famous as an author.
She is here to help the cause of
the blind, the deaf and dumb, and
will visit all the institutions in Australia
taking care of the “twilight” people, as
writer Dowell O’Reilly has fondly named
them. But if he had known Miss Keller
that word would not have occurred to
him, for Helen sparkles. She has wit
and she has fun, and through Polly
Thomson, her friend and companion,
who translates speech almost before it is
spoken into Miss Keller’s palm, she
flashes back a reply ready and apt.
The civic reception to Miss Keller filled
the Mayoral rooms at the Town Hall on
Wednesday morning. Everybody who
had received a card arrived punctually.
There were even three Lord Mayors to
greet the distinguished American:
Sydney’s own Lord Mayor Bartley,
Adelaide’s Lord Mayor J. McLeay and
Melbourne’s Ray Connelly, who has done
the Dick Whittington act and been thrice
Lord Mayor of his city. There were
mauve orchids for Miss Keller to pin in
the lapel of her black suit, and Polly
Thomson was presented with a spray
of white stephanotis for her coat.
Miss Keller shook hands with and
greeted each of the guests by name.
Even a name as hard as McKerihan she
repeated slowly and correctly. Later she
signed the visitors’ book in pencil, ,and it
is a very neat signature indeed. And
through Miss Thomson she made a
speech. One sentence of it:
It is a privilege to receive such generous,
undeserved compliments from the repre-
sentative of a people whose warm-
heartedness and hospitality surround me like
an atmosphere.
President of Sydney Industrial Blind In-
stitution, Mr. Justice Maxwell, and Mrs.
Maxwell, Minister for Education Robert
Heffron, Minister for Housing Clive
Evatt, US. Consul-General Orsen Nielsen
and Mrs. Olive Moore, who is a warm
admirer of Miss Keller, the Cuthbert
Clarkes, Mrs. H. G. Carey, off to England
again in a week or so, knight Ben Fuller
and his lady, Mrs. McLeay, Adelaide’s
Mayoress, Mrs. John Huxtable, Mrs.
Norman Gregg were among those who
said “Welcome.”
The afternoon reception given by the
president and committee of the Royal
Sydney Industrial Blind Institution in
honor of Helen Keller was a great success.
Miss Keller and Miss Polly Thomson
stood first, and then sat, in the ballroom
annexe and greeted the guests, as they
were presented by the society’s president,
Mr. Justice Maxwell. Half of Sydney’s
well-knowns came to this party, and the
gaiety and inspiring spirit of Helen
shed brightness over all. Roy Kippax,
blinded when he was a lad of 17,
and revered by blinded soldiers for the
great help he has been to them, spoke to
Miss Keller in the touch language known
to both.
Mrs. Roy Buckland, Mrs. Chic Bouvet,
Mrs. Maxwell, Mrs. Arthur Eedy, Mrs.
Marcel Dekyvere, Mrs. Murray and
many other members of the women’s
committee helped in the smooth running
of the afternoon. The knight Harry
Moxham couple, the Cuthbert Clarks
were there, the L. A. Robbs, the C. R.
McKerihans. Mrs. Jorstad, the wife of
Norway’s Minister, wore a frock of heavy
white crepe gay with a narrow side-panel
of flower embroideries. The Governor’s
daughter, Elizabeth Northcott, came
with Sheila Collett and Captain Nash.
Knight Ben Fuller and his wife and the
Charles Moores were among the many.
Miss Keller wore with her brown-and-
white-printed silk suit, a charming up-
turned hat of white felt trimmed with
soft brown feathers.
Ex-R.A.A.F. man Bill de Meyrick, of

St. Philip’s was chosen by Alison Tin-
worth for her marriage to Norman Gil-
mour Lockley, of Killara, on Friday
evening. Reception was at the bride’s
home in Cowles-road, Mosman. Nor-
man’s father was “Redgum,” the journa-
listic authority on all things botanical,

Seventy or more original Anzacs —
“Boys of the Dardanelles”—made a night
of it at Pfahlert’s Hotel, last week. That’s
why Adelaide’s Lord Mayor flew over
to Sydney. He was to take the chair,
and guest of honor in that honorable
company was Sir Hugh Cairns, another
Adelaide lad now recognised as one of
the world’s leading brain specialists.
Both were lance-corporals in World
War I. John McLeay also won
the military medal for gallantry whilst
a stretcher-bearer. Sir Hugh was chosen
to come to Australia as the first lecturer
in the Arthur Simms Commonwealth!

The National Council of Women’s
moneybox has hardly a penny to rattle
against the other. So now the committee
is up and doing and bustling around in
the matter of this “Everywoman’s Fair”
to be held on Saturday, April 17, from
two o’clock until five. The late Mrs.
Hubert Fairfax had given permission
that the grounds of her home, Elaine, in
New South Head-road, Double Bay,
should be the scene of the fair, and her
family has expressed the wish that this
plan be carried out. The Council’s only
regular source of income is from affilia-
tion fees of societies and subscriptions of
6s. per year of individual members. Last
year the amount raised was £l63—and
what with increased cost of everything
that’s a, very small amount indeed.
Tall, brunette Joan Dickson, of Yarra-
win station, Brewarrina, was married in
Khartoum on March 22 to Englishman

spend a few months’ furlough in Sussex
with the groom’s father, Colonel Keen,
C.B.E. Bridesmaid was Nancy Atkinson,
of Sydney, and the reception was held in
the grounds of Deputy-Governor Hen-
derson’s house. A color motion-picture
of the ceremony is being flown to the
bride’s parents.
Diamond wedding anniversary party

Thousands of Australians have
memories of long, long, happy pre-war
days passed on the spacious decks of the
Manunda. Well, the Adelaide S.S. Co.
report gladly that the Manunda, after
doing her job of war work as a hospital
ship, is now resuming her coastal run.
Her first trip will be from Sydney to
Fremantle ; and the Manunda is ready,
shining and polished and crisply turned
out, to welcome her first batch of post-
war passengers. The company’s Sydney
manager, Mr. F. K. Harris, gave a press
tea-party last Thursday jn the popular
ship.
From Melbourne
After several wintry days the weather
gods relented and a brilliant autumn day
dawned for the Government House
garden party. Lady Dugan’s lovely
powder-blue frock of soft wool romaine
was draped at the sides with panniers,
and the bodice featured the new rounded
shoulder-line and bracelet-length sleeves.
Of matching blue grosgrain, her flat beret
hat was finished with a cluster of curled
ostrich feathers at one side. Gloves, shoes
and handbag were of pearl-grey suede.
The Governor’s sister, Mrs. J. O.
Haselden, wore a frock overprinted with
white and pale pink flowers ; the crown
of her shallow black straw hat was
massed with pale pink flowers. Mrs.
Hollway, wife of the Premier, wore a
teal-blue angora suit and beige lace
blouse; brown feathers trimmed her
matching hat. Lady Herring’s magnolia
lace blouse was worn under a navy
jacket suit; navy-and-white ribbons were
bunched at the side of her navy off-the-
face hat. Mrs. R. G. Menzies, who with
her daughter Heather accompanied
R. G. Menzies, wore a navy silk frock
striped with white and a navy hat
trimmed with navy-and-white-spotted
veiling. Mrs. John Cain chose a black
moire taffeta suit with a swallow-tail
coat; black taffeta ribbon was threaded
through her large ciel-blue straw hat.
An outstanding ensemble was chosen by
Mrs. P. L, Coleman. Under a brown
corduroy new-length coat, fashioned with
a bouffant skirt and with the sleeves
trimmed with natural fitch fur, she wore
a finely-pleated cream lace frock. Her
brown off-the-face hat was trimmed with
a large bow of cream crinoline straw.
Mrs. John Kaufman’s jacket suit of navy
crepe was worn with a small navy feather
bonnet. Mrs. Edric Henty combined
brown much-braided frock and halo hat
of deep royal-blue velvet.
Lady Clarke’s finely-pleated frock of
black crepe was worn with a Chartreuse
straw hat laden with pink roses. With
Air-Marshal George Jones was his wife,
whose black tricorne hat with roses under
the brim was worn with a slim-fitting
black frock. Mrs. Andrew Swan’s black
hat was also rose-trimmed; with her
black frock she wore pink gloves. Mrs.
C. T. M. Pizey, wife of Rear-Admiral
Pizey, chose hyacinth-blue for her en-
semble ; her accessories were black. Air-
Commodore Scherger’s wife wore a black
braided suit and small black hat trimmed
with cerise, blue and lime ribbons. With
Dr. J. E. Lewis was Mrs. Lewis, whose

wide collar of platina' fox fur. Her off-
the-face black hat was highlighted with a
bunch of cocq feathers. Mrs. Guy
Smith’s mist-blue angora suit was worn
with a matching hat. Mrs. A. A. Lord’s
black frock and silver-fox furs were worn
with a wide-brimmed black straw hat
finished with powder-blue taffeta ribbon.
Mrs. W. J. Hutchinson wore an aqua-
blue velvet coat with a matching hat.
Younger guests included Marigold Myer,
who wore a ciel-blue wool jacket suit with
an upturned brown felt hat slashed with
velvet; Elizabeth Cahill, whose pale-
green jacket suit contrasted with a beret
in Chinese pink; Linda Byron Moore,
wearing a royal-blue frock with an all-
over pattern of tiny silver studs and a
feather-brimmed hat; Diana Medley, in
a pastel-blue ballerina-length jacket suit
and navy hat.
A wedding of considerable interest was
that of Arminell Judith Reynell, only
daughter of Mrs. David Taylor, of
Campbell Town, and the late David
Taylor. The bride, pictured here by
Spencer Shier, was married to Allan
McLean Mackinnon, younger son of Mr.
and Mrs. G. L. Mackinnon, of Conara, at
Kirklands Church/Campbell Town. The
bride’s gown was of rich cream, pink-
tinged slipper satin, the fitting bodice
featuring a high neckline, vandyked at
each side of the shoulders. The peg-top
skirt fell in graceful folds and then ex-
tended into a long train. The tulle veil
was held in place by a coronet of orange
blossoms, which had been worn by her
mother. The bouquet was of cream,
pink-shaded gladioli and of gardenias.
There were five bridesmaids —Phelia
Grimwade, Paddy Beggs, Jean Taylor,
Giliah Northcote and Elizabeth Mac-
kinnon. Their gowns had tight-fitting
bodices, slightly shirred from the centre
back and sweeping skirts with short trains.
Two pink peony roses were set at the
back of the head, and their bouquets were
of green hydrangeas toning into pink.
The groom, who is the fourth generation
to hold the name, was attended by James
Brodribb as best man, with Dick Law-
rence, Peter Bailey, Dick Thomas and
John Taylor as groomsmen. Lindsay
Mackinnon and Alan Taylor were
ushers. Rev. Philip Somerville officiated.
About 300 guests were received in the
drawing-room at St. Johnstone, and the
wedding-breakfast was served in a
marquee adjoining one side of the beau-
tiful old house. The wedding cake was
topped by a vase of heather sent by air
from friends in Scotland. The bride chose
a travelling outfit of primrose angora.
The fully-flared skirt was allied to a short
jacket featuring a nipped-in waistline.
Her deep-beige straw crownless hat was
trimmed on top and at one side with
posies of primroses; accessories were
London tan. The bride and bridegroom
will make their home at Glen Esk,
Conara.
Engagement just announced is that of,
Ann Foley and Lieut. Anthony Sall-
mann, R.A.N. Ann, who is the daughter

is sailing for Australia this month with
her mother. She is wearing a solitaire
diamond engagement ring. Tony is serv-
ing in H.M.A.S. Australia, which has
just returned to Sydney from a goodwill
cruise to New Zealand. He is the son
of Mr. Mrs. Morris Sallmann, of
Toorak, and distinguished himself at the
Naval College, winning the King’s and
the Goodenough Medals.
A cocktail-party to celebrate their in-
stallation in their newly-completed home
in Caulfield was given by Mr. and Mrs.
J. Geoffrey Martin. Mrs. Martin received
the guests in a black crepe ballerina frock.
Among these were Marjorie Mollard,

frock was worn with a small flower hat
in the same shade; well-known singer
Beatrice Oakley, whose black silk frock
was banded in satin; Winifred Gardner,
wearing a cyclamen corduroy-velvet suit;
Mrs. Ben Dunlop, in a pastel-blue frock
with a sunray-pleated skirt; Mrs. Reg
Smithers, in a frock of bright-cherry
wool, and Mrs. Estelle Harvey, who
mixed aqua-blue and black to make an
effective frock, with which she wore a
small black hat.
Revels to mark ’Varsity Commence-
ment Week began with a cabaret ball at
St. Kilda Town Hall, where over 900
students and their friends made merry.
The co-organisers, Mary Grace Adams

party, which included the Vice-Chan-
cellor, J. D. G. Medley, and Mrs. Medley,
the warden of the union, R. R, P.
Barbour, and Mrs. Barbour, the president
of the students’ representative council, R.

George Shaw, undergraduate representa-
tive of the Uni. council. Elizabeth Healy
set-off her pretty brunette coloring with
an off-the-shoulder frock of faille, gaily
printed in poppies and cornflowers. Rena
Jones chose a soft pink taffeta gown.
Wanda Shilliday’s white organdie was
pin-spotted in red and had red ribbon
threaded through the waist, and the full
frill which outlined the hem of the skirt.
A lovely deep-wir»e taffeta gown was
chosen by Moira Shelton, June Richard-
son’s skirt of tropical flower print was
allied to a white top. Enid Baker’s frock
of aqua-blue faille featured a deep band
at the off-the-shoulder bodice; the skirt
was bouffant. Mrs. John Heath’s gown
of red, green and gold flowers with
shoulder-straps of dark-green velvet was
very attractive. Petite Nancy Burgess
pinned red roses in the bodice of her silver
lam 6 gown. Veronica Syme’s rose-pink
and silver-striped lame gown was worn
with a short silver lame bolero. Jill Wort,
who has just announced her engagement
to John Wilkinson, was in rose-pink
taffetas; Pamela Dickie wore a striking
gown of pink-and-white-candy-striped
silk which had the skirt slightly trained,
puff sleeves and a tight-fitting bodice.
Attractive and popular Peggy Mollard
has just announced her engagement to Bill
Day. Peggy, who is the elder daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. F. W. Mollard, of Caul-
field, is president of the Toorak junior

THE SERVICE MAN
TROUBLE IN BERLIN.
“Ek Dum”; Events in Ger-
many, while in some cases
apparently exaggerated in detail
by the press, cannot be exag-
gerated in their general signifi-
cance.
Germany is controlled by the
Four Great Powers in zones
and enclaves'. In the West, from
the North Sea and Baltic, along
a line partly east of the Elbe
and north of a line through
Cassel and Cologne, is occupied
by the British, except for
Bremen, a U.S. enclave. The
French hold a region south of
Cologne in which Coblenz is the
pivot and the Saar the main in-
terest. East of this, between
the French zone border and the
Elbe and south of the British
zone, is the American zone, em-
bracing southern Germany to the
Czechoslovak and Austrian and
Swiss borders.
On the east, a vast area from
the North Sea to Czechoslovakia
. and from the Elbe to Polish terri-
tory is under Russian control,
except for Berlin, which is nomi-
nally under Four-Power control
and divided into zones.
Roughly the west belongs to the
British —the Australian and
other representatives of British
Powers live in Charlottenburg
—Americans and French. The
Russian area lies to the east,
including the old Tempelhof
field and Potsdam, 14 miles
to the south, where the
Russian Army — no longer
known officially as the Red
Army—has its H.Q. Traffic
facilities, however, make it dif-
ficult to keep the zones apart.
The main Russian traffic station
is in the western zone —the
American sector.
How to Reach Berlin
Ground communication with
the British zone from the out-
side world is in the main by
the principal railway making
westward to Hanover and over
the autobahn road, which roughly
follows the same course, and
continues to the Ruhr. The
U.S. route out of Berlin con-
tinues along the same course
from Berlin to the border. U.S.
headquarters in Western Ger-
many are far to the south-west
at Frankfurt.
The Russians have never been
pleasant or predictable in deal-
ings with allies, though their
officers are courteous. Their idea
of an ideal sentry is a frosty-
eyed Tartar with an itchy trigger-
finger and a tommy-gun tucked
under his arm. Trained in a
country where life is cheap and
the population is disciplined at
gun-point, the average Russian
soldier feels the weight of his
uniform and the authority of*
his weapon, and his attitude is
reflected in his behavior.
The British check-point into
Germany is Helmstadt, about
120 miles by road from the capi-
tal. From there to Berlin is a sort
of no-man’s-land controlled by
Russian troops through which
motor-borne British and Ameri-
cans travel as fast as possible,
as if they were crossing enemy
territory under a safe conduct.
There is no night travelling—
the Russian is apt to shoot at
anything moving, just for target
practice.
Trains travel through the cor-
ridor of “our allies” —a corridor
which they did not take from
the Germans but which our
troops held back to give them —
with locked doors from the
frontier onwards and with a,
British or American guard. At
the Russian frontier-post the
Russians send aboard their in-
spection detachment —a couple
of soldiers who examine the
compartments and give anybody
who is not in uniform a good
going-over. The train is about
the slowest in the world. From
the border to Berlin it takes
anything from seven to ten hours
to do the 100-odd miles. The line
is Russian-managed. In the “Ger-
man time” it was one of the
fastest lines in the world, as were
some others in the Reich —the
Berlin-Hamburg mail used to
average nearly 80 miles an hour.
The Russians Hold Trains
The incidents which have dis-
turbed the German zones this
week began on Wednesday night
last when the Russians began to
hold up all trains, demanding
that passengers must have a
new type of Russian traffic
visa and that trains should be
searched for contraband, it be-
ing alleged that the British-
American allies were despoiling
Berlin of industrial equipment
and supplies. Since the Russians
had stripped their own zone in-
dustrially and had even con-
scripted German labor to
send to Russia, they could have
had little complaint had this been
happening (which it was not),
but the whole of their proceed-
ings looked as if designed for
propaganda or some other im-
mediate purpose.
Some of their moves were
belligerent. They, for instance,
attempted to put a road-block
and a detachment into the
British zone, and the detachment
refused to leave until surrounded
by the armor of 400 British
hussars. '
Trains were held up and at-
tempts to examine them were
prevented by the British guards,
who took them- back to the
British zone. American trains
did not run, and aircraft were
used to fly in supplies to the
U.S. zone.
The next move was the send-
ing of a Russian armed guard
into the American zone, where
the Russian railway - station
operated. The Americans re-
sponded by placing the station
in a state of complete siege, with
the Russian general in charge
inside. The Americans called
off their investment when the
Russian guard was withdrawn.
Next the Russians demanded
the amalgamation of several
sub-committees of the Komman-
datura, which runs the Berlin
area, but they so far have had
no satisfaction.
The daily press made the
most of the position. The truth
was serious enough in all con-
science, but the newspapers
added wild tales including,
apparently groundless, of Rus-
sian fighter aircraft diving on
U.S. transports and of other
oppressions of which there is
no official evidence. (At the
week-end traffic arrangements
seemed to be working smoothly,
though it needed only one
rash indiscretion on either
side to produce a serious posi-
tion.)
Russian Motives
The motive behind the Rus-
sian moves might have sprung
from three things. They might
have been propaganda in con-
nection with the Italian elec-
tions and the negotiations with
Franco. They might have been
a preliminary to a Russian move
to get control of the whole of
Berlin. And they might have
been one of the preliminaries
to a move to wrest Eastern Ger-
many by political means from
the Western Allies on the eve
of the operation of the Mar-
shall Plan, which began to func-
tion at the week-end.
There is no doubt that troops
are being poured into Eastern
Germany. It is known that
Field Marshal Paulus, captured
at Stalingrad, is at Stettin. There
is no doubt that the Russian-
controlled police forces through-
out Eastern Germany—they are
a military force armed to the
teeth—have been placed on an
alert basis in strategic areas.
There is no doubt that border
tank-traps and defences are be-
ing built in the west. There is
no doubt also that Russia sits
ready to pounce on Austria, but
needs a pretext and is in any
case not quite ready.
But so far as outward signs
go, they will have no protests
from Britain or the Americans,
who promise to be firm but con-
ciliatory. The British command
over the week-end issued a
statement that it would welcome
any reorganisation which would
improve the smooth working of
the Kommandatura in regard to
committee arrangements, and
that the Russian suggestions
might be found practical, (general
Sokolovsky, the Russian com-
mander, was due to dine with
Marshal Montgomery and
General Robertson last night.
But there is no doubt about the
tension or the significance of the
fact that Field Marshal Mont-
gomery is in the British zone for
“purely military discussion” on
co-operation between British and
U.S. Forces. There is no doubt,
either, that if the Finns finally
reject Russian military domina-
tion, a new source of trouble
will have developed.
The really dangerous months
will be from June to September
unless some accident promotes
trouble earlier.
Spain a Western
Bulwark.
“Ek Dum”: The twice-
affirmed vote of the United
States House of Representatives
—even though it can have no
result save to encourage the
European Powers concerned to
follow suit —to include Spain
in the Marshall Plan of relief for
Europe shows exactly what the
war atmosphere is in Europe,
especially since it was followed
by Mr. Truman’s dispatch of
Mr. Myron C. Taylor, former
Minister to the Vatican, to
Madrid to see General Franco.
There has always been a sort
of hysteria about Franco and
Spain fanned by journalists,
other writers, popularity hunters
and limelighters, and it has
been so universal that on-
lookers are apt to forget
that it was given birth by
Communists and brought by
them to fever-heat. Nothing
which Franco has ever done has
matched the atrocities in which
the Russians have involved
themselves. And he has never
attempted to extend his doctrines
by active conquest to the terri-
tory of his neighbors, as has been
done by the U.S.S.R.
It is easy to picture what
would have happened to Portu-
gal had Stalin instead of Franco
been next-door to it; also easy
to realise what the effects of
action against Portugal might
have been to Britain and to Aus-
tralia in the dark days of 1940-41
when the U.S.S.R. —strongly
defended by the same sections
in British countries that were
attacking “Fascist” Spain—was
fully on the side of Hitler.
Lisbon was a vital port and
crossroads for us; Gibraltar
an essential base.
Russian and Spanish Aid
At the worst period of the
war for Britain Franco did not
provide the facilities for Hitler
which Soviet Russia did. He
never at any time announced in
as did Molotov, that by
supplying food and materials to
Germany he would do his
utmost to break the British
blockade of Germany.
He never at any time made
such an agreement as that con-
tained in the memorandum be-
tween Moscow and Berlin quoted
on Pages 131-132 of the hand-
book on “Nazi-Soviet Rela-
tions” issued a few months ago
by the United States State De-
partment :
The agreement covers a period of
27 months, i.e., the Soviet deliveries,
which are to be made within 18
months, will be compensated by Ger-
man deliveries in turn within 27
months According to the agree-
ment the Soviet Union shall within
the first 12 months deliver raw
materials in the amount of approxi-
mately 500,000,000 Reichsmarks (out-
side the supplies under the August,
1939, agreement) The most im-
portant raw materials to be delivered
by Russia are the following:
1,000,000 tons of grain for cattle
and of legumes.
900.000 tons of mineral oil.
100.000 tons of cotton.
500.000 tons of phosphates.
100.000 tons of chrome ore.
500.000 tons of iron ore.
300.000 tons of scrap-iron and pig-
iron.
2400 kilograms of platinum.
Manganese ore, metals, lumber and
numerous other raw materials —copper,
nickel and other munition metals.
In addition, at that time, the
Soviet Union granted the right
of transit for German goods
from Iran and other countries in
Asia, which the Germans found
“particularly important in view
of our purchases of soy-bean
in Manchukuo.” Stalin saw to
it that “the freight-rates of the
Trans-Siberian railroad were re-
duced 50 per cent, for soy-
beans;” —a tremendous conces-
sion,
It was officially estimated in
the memorandum of the agree-
ment :
Adding certain other items (clear-
ing share of purchase of raw materials
for Germany in third countries), it
may be assumed that during the first
12 months Soviet deliveries and ser-
vices will amount to a total of about
800 million Reichsmarks.
And all this was specifically to
feed the supplies and armament
of the German Wehrmacht during
its invasion of the Scandinavian
countries, France and the United
Kingdom.
While this was going on
Franco made no attempt to
close the Gibraltar Strait as he
might have done, or to interfere
with Portugal and Lisbon com-
munications. And what sup-
plies he was selling abroad, in-
cluding very precious copper,
went largely to the Western
Allies,
Communist Control
Thanks to the hysteria of the
press and its readiness in 1937-39
to accept any yarn which came
out of Moscow, it has always
been accepted that the Spanish
civil war was generated by a
brutal military minority of
Fascists operating against a
popular Government, possessing
the support of the whole of the
Spanish people, which had given
that country liberty and free-
dom of speech and conscience.
The fact of the matter is that
the Republican Government of
Spain, when it was attacked by
Franco, was a regime about as
free as that which now exists in
Czechoslovakia and Albania.
The Communist minority had
captured the Government. The
set-up included People’s Courts,
forced labor, the destruction of
the church and religion, the
utter suppression of the free
press and use of the iron
curtain.
The plan which had brought
about the ascendancy of the
Communists had been inter-
national and had been organised
by the Comintern (as is shown
by the printed proceedings of
that body) and by the same
bureau which had organised the
rebellion in South Africa that
cost hundreds of lives in 1922.
The Government was a ruthless
minority Government of ruffians
in whose company Hitler and
Goring would have been
thoroughly at home had the
Republicans held office for
another three years. It is a
solemn thought that if the
Spanish Republicans had sur-
vived in office until 1939
they would undoubtedly
have followed the lead of the
U.S.S.R. and have been on the
side of Hitler, doing everything
possible to forward his victory.
Had they, instead of Franco,
been in office at that time it is
almost beyond doubt that they
would have sought to close the
Gibraltar Strait and block off
the Mediterranean from Britain,
a measure in which success
would certainly have led to
serious consequences for us.
A very large proportion
of the Spanish Republican
forces consisted of persons
with no interest in the Spanish
war save that they belonged to
a Communist party somewhere.
They fought not for Spain,
but for Russia. They applied
the “scorched-earth” technique,
which the U.S.S.R. failed to
apply (despite its propaganda)
during the German invasion of
1941, heedless of the fact that
it would leave the population
starving and homeless. Their
attitude was: “If we cannot
govern we will make it impos-
sible for anyone else to gov-
ern,” a complete negation of
“democratic” theory.
Tito and Franco
An agreement to accept Spain
into the Western Group is just
as pardonable as, or more so
than (even allowing that Franco
is certainly no democrat), the ac-
ceptance of Chiang Kai-shek. It
is more justified than the accept-
ance of Tito in 1942-43. Tito did
exactly what Franco is accused
by the Communists of having
done in Spain, with the marked
difference that while Franco was
a Spaniard who held no allegi-
ance to any Power outside his
country, Tito was a Russian mer-
cenary, who actually, before he
liquidated the popular leadership
in Yugoslavia, had been a
Russian mercenary agent in
Spain.
A Military Viewpoint
The reason for backing Tito
was a military one. The good
reason for admitting Franco to
the benefits of tne Marshall Plan
is also a military one. As the
west of France jvas the natural
starting-point for the attack on
Germany, so is Spain the natural
defensive base for the defence of
Western Europe against Com-
munistic aggression.
In realisation of this strategic
fact has already lain the anxiety
of Moscow and its followers to
set the world against the non-
Communist Government of
Spain. With Spain under Com-
munist rule, the rest of Western
Europe would be merely the
meat in a Communist sandwich.
With Spain under a rule which
would allow its use for a de-
fence against Communist in-
vasion from the East, the
Western Allies have a starting-
line and an assembly base.
The House of Representatives
vote was given at a crucial
moment — (a) when Tito was
assembling troops on the Trieste
border, ( b ) when Russia was
closing the Iron Curtain on the
hordes of Eastern Germany, (c)
when the Pan-American Con-
ference was meeting in Bogota,
(d) when the Italian elections
were a fortnight off.
No doubt the thoughts of
those who voted for the United
States Congressional resolution
were partly influenced by a
glimpse at the list of the coun-
tries which have recognised the
“Spanish Republican Govern-
ment in Exile” —Czechoslovakia,
Guatemala, Mexico, Panama,
Poland, Rumania, Venezuela,
Yugoslavia; Russian puppets
and/or anti-British and anti-
U.S, to the last of them.

CHANCE LIVING
FREQUENTLY CAUSES IRREGULARITY
It is important to remember that changes of
food and living conditions invariably disar
range the system, and when that occurs nature
needs assistance, at least temporarily. Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills are especially suited
for this purpose. When going away for a
change, always make a practice of having a
bottle with you and taking a dose occasionally
to stir the liver and keep the bowels acting
regularly.

AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Concluded on Saturday, the AJ.C.’s
four-days Autumn Carnival was the
most successful in the history of the
club. A re-check of turnstiles showed
that attendance on the first day had
been 93,746, a record for Randwick.
Total attendance for the four days
was 245,600 and the tote turnover
£773,193. Winners and placed horses
split nearly £60,000 among them in
added money and sweepstakes.
Principal races on Wednesday were
two w.f.a. events and the Champagne
Stakes. The latter has, in the past,
provided its share of upsets and added
to the number when odds-on favorite
Riptide took a thorough pasting. The
very fine-looking Brueghel filly Wattle
(D. Munro) won comfortably from
Bold Duke with the favorite a poor
third. While giving the filly and Bold
Duke all due credit. Riptide’s effort
was almost too bad to be true.
The mile All-Aged Stakes was won
by Murray Stream (J. Eaves), down-
ing Money Moon and Victory Lad.
A six-year-old chestnut horse of out-
standing appearance, Murray Stream,
for a horse of his quality, has never
been much of a friend to the average
punter, but he has shown model con-
sistency in recent starts. The dual
Metropolitan winner is to go north
for the Queensland winter meetings
and then be retired.
Two other fine horses seen in action
for the last time at the Autumn meet-
ing were the Melbourne Cup winners
Hiraji and Russia. Hiraji collapsed,
with a broken sesamoid bone, during
the running of the Sidney Cup; Rus-
sia went out in a blaze of glory with
two slashing w.f.a. wins and is now
headed for the stud.
On Wednesday, Russia led from
start to finish to take the 14-furlongs
Cumberland Stakes. On Saturday, in
like fashion, and even more easily,
he downed Columnist, surprisingly
favored to beat him, and Paktong
in the A.J.C. Plate of two miles and
a quarter. The only time-record still
credited to Phar Lap is the Randwick
figure of for the AJ.C. Plate
distance; Russia clocked 3.50|.
The conditions of both Cumberland
Stakes and AJ.C. Plate provide that
unless the race be run in less than a
given time the prize shall be halved.
Russia won the Cumberland in 17|sec.
inside the stipulated time, and the
Plate with 24|sec. to spare. He goes
to stud the winner of over £33,000 in
stakes and with an established repu-
tation as the best true stayer of his
day.
Hiraji is to be patched up to enjoy
a well-earned spell for the rest of his
days. He has been in training with
scarcely a let-up for the past 18
months or more, raced frequently,
and never run a bad race; hard racing
may have contributed to his eventual
breakdown.
Melbourne visitors didn’t fare too
well over the first three days of the
meeting, but took revenge on Saturday
when Denhoti, Jalna and Sanctus won
their respective races and gave
Victorian rider H. Badger a winning
treble. Badger had also won the
St. Leger on the Victorian, Cronides.
Left at the start in a previous run,
when Munro had been in the saddle,
Denhoti had a stylish win from Ralph,
Verbage and other moderate sprinters
in the six-furlongs Rous Handicap.
Worth noting in this was the effort
of Cognac, setting a cracking pace
until collared inside the distance. He’s
a three-year-old Agincourt colt trained
by W. Kelso, has done little racing,
and is eligible for something much
easier.
Confirming the suggestion of
stamina shown by her close third in
the Oaks some time back, Jalna,
another of the Dhotis, had a run-
away win from Respond and Shading
in the 10-furlongs Adrian Knox Stakes
for three-year-old fillies. The hot
favoritism of Nizam’s Ring in this
race was a tribute to her past repu-
tation; she’s had several runs this
time up without showing a trace of
form.
Sanctus, a five-year-old Parenthesis
gelding, has, at times, been written
off as a “mere plodder,’’ but there
was no plodding about the brilliant
finish he unwound to defeat Herbert
River, New Cashmere and others over
the 13 furlongs of the Dangar Handi-
cap.
Sanctus gave H. Badger his sixth
winner of the meeting. Most success-
ful of the other riders was G. Moore
with five, the fifth being the Golden
Sovereign filly Sheba, who gave 15
colts weight and a thorough hiding in
the Fernhill Handicap, the first mile
race of the season for two-year-olds.
Winding up the show, Titanic (A.
“He misses with that left hook all the time!”
Breasley), this page’s unsuccessful
selection for the Doncaster, made
small amends by taking the Final
Handicap of 10 furlongs.
* * * *
Keenest betting race at
on Saturday was the 10-furlongs Ber-
wick Handicap for three-year-olds.
Punters’ opinions varied to the extent
of having three equal-favorites at
7 to 2 and another runner at fours.
When there are that many chances
in a race it’s a wise punter who leaves
’em alone, but for those who must
have a lash there’s nothing like fol-
lowing the handicapper’s opinion. The
first five in the weights were the first
five past the post in the Berwick,
with topweight Hororata winning
from second topweight Golin’s Pride
and Saxony.
Hororata, who lumped 9st. and
showed great gameness in holding oft
repeated challenges from Colin’s
Pride, is a brown colt by Hellespont
from Brilliana.' He is the colt who,
last year, scored a fluke win in the
Caulfield Guineas when jockey Breas-
ley, with the race, as he thought, well
won, went to sleep on the favorite
Chanak. His sire Hellespont was a
very successful racehorse in France,
though not noted for stamina; nine
furlongs was as far as he won at.
The success of Hororata completed
a double for jockey R. Heather, who
also took the Hume Juvenile on
Derrymore. Lady Luba, a daughter
of The Buzzard, was favorite for this
two-year-old event and gave suppor-
ters a great show, going under by a
half-head in a photo.-finish; she
was in receipt of 91b. but did well
to finish so close after getting away
badly.
Another very open affair was the
13-furlongs Waverley Handicap with
five runners given a chance at 11 to
2 or less. Bookies pocketed the lot
when six-year-old Sir Toba, at 16 to
1, displayed remarkable improvement
by winning easily from Miss Prim
and Laudate; a protest was unsuc-
cessful. In view of his price, which
should have been 100 to 1, somebody
must have had an inkling about the
winner; his only previous success was
in a six-furlongs Maiden Plate at
Geelong more than 12 months ago.
The six-furlongs Autumn Stakes
saw favorite Carnage given weight
and a sound beating by the Industry
gelding High Production, with Royal
Mark third. Magnina (B. Forristal)
and St. Placid (H. Hall) took the two
divisions of the mile Dromana Welter.
The Beach Hurdle was won by
favorite and topweight Cheery Boy
(L. Meenan).

In recent years it has become the
custom for Sydney G.P.S. oarsmen
to compete at the historic Riverview
Gold Cup Regatta, and the senior
club crews don’t get much of a look-
in these days. This year’s Gold Cup
final, fought out by St. Joseph’s,
Shore, University and Grammar, was
a thriller. They finished in that order,
but there was less than two lengths
between them at the finish, or for that
matter at any point in the race. Other
school crews contested the junior
eights, which High won from Scots
and King’s.

Tom Brudenall, described as a 23-
year-«ld leather-worker, worked the
leather to some purpose by winning
the final of the Stawell Gift. He won
try a yard from E. P. Marantelli in
12 3-16 sec. and was strongly favored
to do so despite rumors of a dicky
leg. Dicky legs are usually in plenti-
ful supply prior to these pro. races.

Sprinter John Treloar will pick up
with the Olympic team in London.
Meanwhile he’s off to America, where
his uncle is a University professor,
to get experience on cinder-tracks and
against class opposition. Just what
he needs to top him off as our best
prospect in the ever-increasing horde
likely to be sent to the Games.

John Bromwich, dropped from the
Davis Cup team because he refused
air travel, and Victorian Frank Sedge-
man, “included out” in order that a
couple of inferior players might be
included in, are both heading for
Wimbledon, where they will team in
the doubles.
The M.C.C. team touring the West
Indies put up one record which isn’t
likely to get a mention in Wisden’s,
nor, it is to be hoped, be repeated;
they didn’t win a match. With some
prospective new blood being given a
trial, the team whs scarcely the
strongest available.

Commenting recently on Joe Louis’s
decline and near-fall, ex-champ. Jack
Dempsey pointed out: “Up to this
last fight (against Walcott) Louis had
boxed only eight or nine rounds under
fire in six years. There is a big differ-
ence between actual fighting and ex-
hibition or training-camp stuff.” Of
Joe’s present exhibition trip to Eng-
land, Dempsey said “This trip abroad
won’t help him a bit. It will hurt
him. He’ll be mixing with big crowds,
will be entertained, and will be meet-
ing. punks in a few exhibitions.”
Dempsey’s opinion aside, Louis, in his
trip to England, is undertaking a pro-
gramme which at least reads like a
fair conditioning gallop. In return
for a trifle of 80,000 dollars he is to
box two rounds three times a day for
26 days—a total of 78 sparring ses-
sions. An interesting item of Joe’s
luggage for the trip was 300 slabs of
steak; he’ll need .’em.

Too speedy with his, punches, Ted
Sprouster (9.1 i) outpointed Jackie
Wilson (9.5) at Leichhardt. In addition
to weight, Wilson had an advantage
in reach, and, being a heady boxer,
worried Sprouster for a few rounds.
A right uppercut in the fourth, how-
ever, turned the tide, and, though
unable to score the k.o. he was striv-
ing for, Sprouster won easily enough
on points. Sprouster now has notions
of tackling Eddie Miller.


ABORIGNALITIES
“Blime”: Took a job riding for old
man Stacey, and got shoved in to bunk
with Dill Peters. Dill collected his weekly
screw for a turn at rabbiting, fencing,
fern-cutting or any such backbreaker
that struck the boss as urgent at the
moment, and for the first couple of
weeks he was right enough as a hut-mate.
Then the silly cow took to creeping out
with the crack of dawn, donning his
clobber and disappearing mysteriously.
At the other end of the day, too, he was
absent long after the rest of us had
knocked off. For a while I said nothing ;
then, catching him climbing stealthily
into his pants at an unearthly hour, I
tackled him on the subject. “Sh-sh,” he
whispered warningly. Then, in a burst
of confidence: “It’s these flamin’ ’eads,”
be murmured. “Man’s jus’ got t’ do
things under the lap nowadays.” I sat
up and stared. “Ruin the flamin’ coun-
try, if they was let,” Dill breathed from
behind a hand as he cautiously pulled
on a boot. “But they ain’t puttin’ nothin’
over me, see? Don’t you let on, will
y’?” He picked up his lid, then turned
back with a grimace of disgust. “Them
an’ their blarsted forty-hour week they’ve
brought in,” he hissed venomously.
“Cripes, if a bloke took any notice of
’em he’d never get ’is flamin’ work done.”
* * * *
“Zake”: I have heard many expres-
sions in the bush which have caustically
reflected on men, but the most crushing
was one spoken in serious tones of a
drover. “That cow! ” quoth the defamer.
“Why, even his dorg’ll eat wombat!”
Could insult, after all, be greater?
♦ * * *
“Macnell”: From our feet the Bali
jungle fell away in great swathes of green,
stooping in undulating waves downward
to the sea. To our right we stood on the
edge of a 1000 ft. precipice dropping sheer
to a crater lake lying in the crags like a
patch of fallen sky. Behind us, just under
the mountain’s lip, was the Temple of
Batoer, where we were to watch the Kris
dance. We were just in time. Down the
temple steps glided six youths, oil-
glistening bodies naked but for a snowy
loincloth, in their right hands a long,
twisting dagger. The backward move-
ments of trunks and hands contrasted
sinisterly with their creeping steps.
Muscles were swollen and tense, eyes
wide, gleaming already under the muted
throb of tom-toms and anklung. The
latter sounded like humming-birds, clear
and transparent, as chimes floating
away on the breeze. That was the beauty
of procreation ; the savage undertone of
tom-toms meant blood, for the Kris is
essentially a blood dance. Quicker grew
the movements. The faces were stiffened
in abandoned grimaces, set by that de-
lirious fanaticism which prepares them
to shed blood for the goddess Kali. The
tom-toms’ throb rose in a pulsing cres-
cendo, was beaten back by the watching
wall of jungle. Eyes rolled, mouths
gaped in frenzy. As the music swelled to
a thunder of sound the demented youths
gave a united shriek, and before our eyes
stabbed their bodies savagely with the
kris. The reddened blades descended
again and again. One after another they
collapsed on the spattered stones, pour-
ing blood, until all were down. A priest
approached swiftly and filled the wounds
with crushed herbs. The dancers were
carried by their women into the shade of
the statue of Kali. The music died softly
—all had offered blood to Kali.

“Esk D.”: It is early afternoon on
Brenigans’ farm. Joe is snoozing on the
sofa and Harry is sawing wood dream-
fully in the big easychair. The phone
rings. Joe snores on, but Harry stirs,
waddles over and props himself against
the instrument. A few seconds later he
is rushing outside and throwing himself
on a horse, and they are off in a cloud of
dust. Round and about the farm they
gallop, Harry yelling vociferously and
sooling the dogs. Joe is standing on the
verandah when he gets back. “Cripes.
here’s the rabbit-inspector just cornin’ in
the gate,” Joe says. “He’ll summons us
f’r sure when he sees all them rabbits
round the farm.” “No bloomin’ fear,”
Harry replies. “Sam gave me the tip
half an hour ago. He won’t se; a rabbit.
I’ve jist bin round an’ driv ’en all down
the burrows!”

“Mat’s Mate”: Gippsland, and raining
torrents, with me and Mat struggling
under our knots on a back road across
the hills between Lang Lang and War-
ragul. The timber was thin and straggly,
and we were getting a bit worried as we
ploughed through the mud. Then we
rounded a spur and came on a farm-
house, Through the rain its chimney
waved a banner of cheerful smoke, and
the big fellow led the way to it. We
dropped our swags, a ton or so of mud
and. a few gallons of water on the
verandah. Then Mat knocked, A little,
“While you're about it , Doc. —how about stitching up thi S?”
peaky bloke opened the door. “Cripes,”
he said. “Come in, come in an’ dry y’r-
selves orf. I was just boilin’ the billy.”
While we backed up to the fire he hurried
round, got out some bacon and eggs,
bread and butter and prepared us a
slap-up feed. “Your missus away?”
asked Mat, chewing heartily. “Eh? Aw,
I got no missus.” And the peaky bloke
burst out laughing. “Aw,” said Mat,
“y’ need a missus on a farm.” The
peaky bloke laughed a lot more. We
looked at each other, sensing something
funny. After a bit the rain cleared and,
full and dry and happy, we humped our
knots and headed for the main road.
We’d hardly got going along it when a
large woman in a sulky passed us in the
opposite direction. About 20 minutes later
we heard flying hooves and looked round
to see the peaky bloke, crouched low on
a racing hack, tear past with the large
woman standing up in the sulky in hot
pursuit. “Y’ need a missus on a farm,”
howled the fugitive, vanishing down the
road. Mat looked at me, shamefaced.
“I oughter’ve known better soon’s I
saw that feed on a 4aippslarid cocky’s
table f’r a coupla bagmen,” he said.

“Moyhu”: No experienced collector
would put a dead snake into a ; bottle, nor
attempt to force a live snake into one.
Placed in the bottle after death the
wriggler would lie shapeless and supine on
the bottom. Forced in—well, I wouldn’t
care to try it. Voluntary entry into the
bottle is the best move. The snake, even
in death, will then retain all the linea-
ments of life, reaching in a graceful
spiral to the base of the cork. To induce
the reptile to enter the bottle, hold its
head firmly to the ground with a forked
stick, placing a fair-sized bottle, neck
foremost, an inch or two away. On his
release Joe will make straight into the
nearest hole —the bottleneck. Place cork
in position and add spirit at leisure.

“Betcha”; Always inclined to the be-
lief that it was the red-eyed crow that
was the lamb-killer and his white-eyed
brethren were harmless, insect-eating
rooks. But not now. There was a
bunch of the black demons living in the
paddock and taking a daily toll
by descending on the lambing ewe
and immediately collecting tongue
, and eyes of her offspring upon its arrival
into the world. Several times I had
watched the bunch iff their act of destruc-
tion, but never managed to get within
range. Then, gathering the morning’s
dead, I placed them in the crow-trap and
retired to a job within sight of the pad-
dock. The bunch of Kellys lazed over
several times, watching for prospects,
then they spotted the bait in the trap and
descended, A couple of hours later I had
11 captives. They consisted of five red-
eyed crows and six of the white-eyed
variety. As far as I could see there were
no other dissimilar features. Does the
answer lie in the mating of the two
varieties, or is the old belief empty as a
taxpayer’s pocket?
* * * , *
“B.”: The big draught-mare hadn't
been off the place much, running or work-
ing year after year with a bunch of bays
and blacks. Then, being short of a nag,
I shoved her in the cart and drove to-
wards town. We met all variety of
vehicles, but the quiet mare took no
notice till suddenly she spotted a white
horse in a roadside paddock. Throwing
up her head, she snorted and backed,
and maybe I’d be there yet if a kid hadn’t
arrived to chase the offending apparition
over the ridge till I got past. Since
then the mare hunts white horses. Not
only in that paddock, but everywhere we
go. And she never fails to land me in
a bad spot when she finds one. A white
calf she accepts as interesting but excus-
able, but I’ve given up trying to make
her see reason towards a ghostly nag.
The silly part of the business h that the
draught-mare herself is snow-white.

“C.A.L.”: The sun was rising as the
cattlemen mounted and set the mob
moving on another day’s stage. Over a
stony rise a utility roared into view, and
a few seconds later Bullswool, the man-
ager of the station through which the
cattle were travelling, brought the car to
a stop at the camp. “Who’s boss here?”
he roared. “I am,” roared back One
Feed Paddy. “Well, what do you mean
by leaving those cattle in the watering-
yard all night? Can’t you read the
notice on the board?” bellowed the
manager. “Of course I can,” answered
Paddy. “But they were too wild for me
to camp in the yard with.” Bullswool
clambered out of his seat and strode over
to the notice. Studying it a while he
turned and walked back to his utility.
As he started off he called to Paddy
“You win.” The horsetailer, who could
neither read nor write, turned to Paddy.
“Well, what’s the board say?” he asked.
“Only what I told Bullswool,” Paddy
answered. “Drovers are not allowed to
camp in this yard with cattle,”
* * * sp
“Bo”: Our utility had broken down,
and when Crosswell came along in the
sulky drawn by the ancient horse Sander-
son and I accepted his offer of a lift.
The moke had the weirdest action I ever
saw. It had to be continually goaded,
and under this it effected a sidewise clop
mixed with a double-shuffle that brought
its hooves down almost in the place from
which it had lifted them —all to
the accompaniment of asthmatic wheezes
and grunts. After 10 minutes we seemed
scarcely closer to the town than when
he’d picked us up, and as we wanted to
get a couple of parcels away by the train
that passed through in another 10 minutes,
with still half a. mile to go, we cautiously
mentioned the possibility of the prad’s
moving at more than two m.p.h. Cross-
well handsomely conceded the possibility
and brought all his powers of persuasion
to bear on Captain’s rump. There came a
sound like an engine blowing-off excess
steam from the safety-valve, followed l?y
an almost frantic thrashing of hooves
as we §wayed from side to side with the
action of the now galvanised steed.
Crosswell hung to the reins as if disaster
would assuredly attend their slackening,
and he gazed fearfully at the road ahead
for any traffic. Sanderson, glancing
anxiously at his watch, wondered if the
horse could go any faster —it was then,
we estimated, doing three m.p.h. Cross-
well looked at him, startled. “Cripes,”
he said. “He’s gallopin’ now—do y’
want him to bolt with us?”

“Eastern”: As secretary of the local
Progress Association, Hal went into town
on sale-day to notify members of an im-
portant meeting that was pending. En-
tering the post-office he ran into Cockie
Hodge. “Having a meeting Saturday
night, Cockie,” Hal told him. “I know
you’re busy, but try and get there, won’t
you? It’s at half-past seven.” The other
agreed. Five minutes later the store-
manager bustled in. “Meeting Saturday
night, George,” Hal informed promptly.
“Right. What time?” “Eight-thirty.”
The store bloke nodded. “I’ll be there,”
he called back from the doorway. He
had no sooner disappeared than Weary
mooched in, and Hal repeated his infor-
mation. Weary rubbed a hand slowly over
his forehead. “Awright,” he sighed.
“What time?” Hal eyed him thought-
fully. “If you get there*by quarter to
eight it’ll do,” he answered. Hal was
picking up his mail to follow Weary
when the post-office bloke interrupted.
“Cripes, how many meetings y’ got on
Saturday night?” he puzzled. “That’s
three different times y’ve arranged
already.” Hal grinned knowingly. “Only
one meeting,” he confided quietly, “but,
you see, I want to get ’em all there by
half-past eight so we can start on time.”

“Jemac”; One of the most interesting,
yet least-known, relics on the Queens-
land coast is a rough cairn of stones
atop lonely Lizard Island, near Cook
Passage, in the reef. Here Captain
Cook climbed to seek a way out through
the binding coral; and saw below him
the deep, mile-wide channel now bearing
his name. Here we climbed to seek his
cairn and saw below us a Manly ferry!
It was the South Steyne, outward bound
from England.,

“E.”: George Bell, a stubborn
giant with the heart and constitution of
a working bullock, literally hewed a fine
property out of the scrub and timber
on the slopes above Kettle Creek. In
the meantime he reared four lusty sons
and fondly expected them to carry on and
increase the family holdings. But the
boys drifted one by one to jobs in the
city, their mother died and George’s
dreamf-castle tottered. Fourteen years
roll on. None of the boys has been home
since Mrs. Bell’s funeral. George has
found solace in the wine-jar and old
English ballads punished in a cracked
tenor. Ferns and blackberries are allowed
free rein on the farm and countless
rabbits flaunt their valuable overcoats.
George waddles slowly to the mail-box,
but there is only another threatening
letter about the ’berries. He discards it,
glances wistfully down the road and sees
Jim Taylor’s utility bounding erratically
in his direction. From it alights his
favorite son, well fed and prosperous-
looking. “Y’ came home, Reg,” says the
old man shakily. Reg shakes hands and
his eyes rove over the pitiful hulk before
him. “I’m glad y’ come,” the old man
quavers. “Are y’ goin’ t’ stay an’ work
the place now?” “Well, not exactly,”
says Reg in his elegant Bourke-street
accent. “I jist popped in on me way
round the districk. I’m with the New
Machinery crowd now. Y’ wouldn’t want
t’ buy a chaff cutter, would y ’?”

“Plankton”: One of the most remark-
able Australian insects flew 7 across my
garden shortly after sunrise. It was rather
slow in flight, the body slim, brightly
barred with yellow and dark-brown or
black and about half an inch long. The
forewings, longish and of a transparent
gauzy texture, vibrated rapidly, affording
the sole and somewhat ineffective means
of propulsion; for the hind-wings were
modified into a pair of most extraordinary
thin, spirally twisted ribbon-like append-
ages in contrasting colors, quite obviously
more ornamental than useful. With the
latter waving in the wind, the legs and
body held vertically, and the spread
wings above, the insect much suggested
a miniature living helicopter. Belonging
to an odd family of the lacewings, in-
cluding only four Australian examples,
it’s name W probably Croce attenuate »
one of the two thread-winged species.
AUTUMN AFTERNOON.
Out and away go the whirling midges
Swarming the paths of the yellow air
Over the roofs and the timbered ridges,
Over the hills to heaven knows where.
Claret and crimson and amber dapple
The withered orchards’ uneven rows;
By red leaves falling and redder apple
Slowly, slowly the Yarra flows.
Times by eucalypt screened and shrouded.
Times where wattles and willows drown,
Loth to come to the overcrowded
Smoky jungles of Melbourne Town.
A little wind from the west advances,
Ruffles and ripples and runs away
From the looking-glass of the sun’s last
glances,
The dimpling mirror of waning day.
Dusk like a ghost comes down the river
Chill with the threat that day denied,
The sheen on the water turns to a shiver,
The light from the mountain-tops has died.
The golden airs that were lately showering
Through boles and branches have ceased
to comb
The grasses rich in. the last late flowering,
The hawking swallows have all gone home.
I must make the most of this gold-dust
weather,
Of all things lovely and almost lost:
Deep in my heart and the day together
The sure foreknowledge of coming frost.
VICTORIA.
K. DALZIEL.


“Trade Wind”; Every man, like every
rope, has his breaking-strain. If you’ve
reached yours, and need a spell from the
stone jungle of the city, you want a
sailing-boat under your hand. Sailing
across the sea in a lean lovely thing of
gleaming wood and salt-white canvas will
divorce you utterly from the drab world
sinking astern. Awaiting you aboard-
ship—if only the ship be small enough—■
is the cool morning blush, when the sun
lifts up the veil of the morning mist and
sparkles on a sea that is a miracle of
azure. The water bubbles in the wake
like champagne, and it is a sheer delight
to run your hand along the sun-warmed
planking. Then you lean back and blow
out the binnacle-lamp and smoke a pipe
before calling your shipmates. There are
moonlit nights, when the starlight
trembles on the ripples'’ of the wake, and
the stars hang countless above the mast-
head in a thin cloud of luminous dust.
A beacon opens its friendly eye every few
seconds far across the moonlit distance.
There are other nights when the sky is
dirty and the towering seas moan for
miles behind you. Then you wonder if
your craft can face the mighty enmity of
ocean and win her way against it. You
watch her lift, striking the seas into a
wreath of futile foam, and feel ashamed
of your doubt. Since the war Australians
have evinced a growing interest in deep-
sea sailing. When next you see a hdming
sailboat gliding towards you down the
path of the sun, its bow breaking the
radiant water into a dust of gold, you
may understand why more people are tak-
ing to sailing the seas in little ships—
they have discovered a way to live.

“Plop”: Back from the Sydney Show,
Harry Johnson told us that as he
was waiting at a tram-stop he was
joined by a dapper little man who started
talking about the uncertainty of life.
“My friend,” he said, “life is valued
cheaply these days. Only this morning
I was walking along the pavement when
a taxi swerved to avoid an old lady. His
cab mounted the footpath. Luckily I
saw it coming and leaped—only a miracle
saved me from death! I was prepared.
But, my friend, I would put a question
to you—‘Are you prepared?’ ” Harry
got in early and said he wasn’t interested
in religious tracts. “You don’t under-
stand,” replied the little bloke. “I repre-
sent the Acme Arch Support Company.”
Harry reckons he’s lucky he only had
three pairs of shoes to fit ’em to.

“Force 8”: “Macnell’s” typhoon (B.
24/3/’4B) isi most commonly met in the
South China Sea and the Java Sea to-
“Stop teasing her , Alf."
wards the end of the monsoon season,
When air from the poles blows north or
south over surfaces that continually
grow warmer the bottom layers of these
vast air oceans are heated and the air
becomes unstable. Slowly masses of hot
air revolve, gradually climbing, and the
colder air descends to take its place. As
tropical areas are reached and more air
is heated the movement becomes swifter.
Faster and faster the air sweeps, until at
its climax a terrific vortex rushes
violently across the surface of the sea,
scooping up great ridges of water that
could smash an unwary ship on to a
wave-smothered reef and beat the life
out of her. The centre is calm; but
navigators know better than to have that
calm pass over them. When this happens
the giant wind blows furiously in one
direction, ceases for a time and then
roars with equal force from the opposite
direction. This mounts a confused, pyra-
midal sea which is especially dangerous.

“Bosun’s Mate”: Natives round Ros-
sell Island, near Samarai, have a piquant
imagery distinct from the more practi-
cal tribes further west. They believe the
reefs divide good spirits from bad, and
that flying-fish are those spirits trying to
get to their destined fate. Near Rossell
Island is a sacred bare knoll called Bald
Hill. This, to native minds, is incredibly
beautiful, with all the lush appurtenances
of a paradise. Bereaved ones search along
the sand at its foot for flying-fish tracks
* —they know that their dead have passed
the reef division and are happily en-
sconced in the bliss of Bald Hill.

“C.E.”: Old Sam paused in his stump-
grubbing as the car from the township
pulled up and a fellow got out, gazed
around at the bush paddock and
sauntered across. “Hear you’ve got a
decent patch of wattlebark anyone can
have for the stripping,” the newcomer
greeted, “That’s right,” Sam agreed
affably. “Haven’t got time t’ strip it meself,
an’ it’s too valuable to waste. Thought
some o’ you chaps might’s well have
it.” The prospective stripper eyed
the paddock speculatively. “S’pose a
bloke c’d knock up twenty quid a week
easy enough,” he remarked, “but what
about those trees on the spur? Y’ got a
truck I could borrer t’ get the bark down
to the road?” Sam rubbed his chin.
“Aw, yair,” he decided, “I c’d let y’ have
me truck, I s’pose.” “All right, an’ I’ll
get y’ to give us a hand with the cartin’,
too,” the splitter went on. “Never was
much good at loadin’. No strings to the
flamin’ job, is there?” he added sus-
piciously, “No,” Sam shook his head.
“Only want y’t’ fall the wattles so I c’n
burn ’em later on.” The other’s eyes
narrowed, “So that’s it, eh?” he sniffed.
“Get me t’ strip y’r bark so y’ll get y’r
trees fell. Well, y’ ain’t puttin’ that over
me, see? You blarsted cockies c’n do
y’r own flamin’ work. G’day.”

“Conda”: I had heard of Bali as “the
land where the angels fly low” (B.
17/3/’4B), but not till we anchored in
Pantai Tumin did I realise why. An in-
describably sweet sound trembled through
the air. Above the fo’c’sle a flock of
pigeons circled, trailing behind them a
shining rain of silver music. Tiny bells
were tied to the pigeons’ feet and bam-
boo whistles to their tails.

“Old-timer”: Chummy Schaeffer boiled
his billy by the council tank at Lascelles
and then withdrew to the scrub on the
Hopetoun-road for the night. A sickle
moon hung low over the mallee as two
wallabies crept down to the tank and
two large and bloodthirsty staghounds
from the village sighted them. Ten
seconds later paws thudded on Chummy’s
chest and a swinging tail caught him
across the face. He struggled out of his
blankets, only to be hit by a galloping
staghound. Convinced that the Woome-
lang train had jumped the rails and was
running over him. Chummy burst from
the scrub in his shirt-tails and bolted into
Lascelles, where a church bazaar
caught sight of his hairy shanks and
most of it let out a howl and took after
him. He turned at the pub corner,
legged it past the school, across the foot-
ball ground and into the pines on the
far side. Some of the bazaar kept after
him, others pulled the policeman out of
bed and old Maloney got his d.-b. gun
and perforated the night with No. 6
shot. Chummy, winded and alarmed,
circled the hamlet, reached his wrecked
camp, hurriedly trousered and swagged
"I still think you got the bigger half."
himself and fled west. And even now in
Lascelles old hands can be found who
remember the mysterious wild white man
who raced through that night and was
never seen again.

“X.E.D.”: When Brickie took sick
with stomach pains in the middle of the
night Fred, who prided himself on his
medical knowledge, plied him with bak-
ing-soda and optimism. The victim was
worse by morning, but Fred was positive
it was only indigestion and continued
the treatment. The boss came in later
and insisted that Brickie be taken to
hospital. There he was operated on im-
mediately for acute appendicitis. “Shows
what harm you knowalls can do,” the
boss lectured Fred. “The doc. said he’d
have had no chance if left another couple
of hours.” “Aw, I dunno,” replied Fred,
“Y’ took a risk shovin’ him in hospital,
though. Y’ never know what might’ve
happened t’ him. What’s more, it might
turn out it wasn’t his appendix after all.
He still had a sorta gutsache when I saw
him the day after.”

“Jim O’Keeffe”: Perhaps the Council’s
physicists can correct me, but I’ve long
harbored the impression that nothing at
all is completely impervious to light, and
that sunlight is a compound of every
form of light that ever was. Rontgen,
and others following him, have succeeded
in separating, concentrating and directing
certain rays that will penetrate human
bodies, metals and what not. Even the
composition and structure of lead, which
protects practitioners from the damaging
effects of X-rays, can be shown up under
certain correctly-applied rays. There are
various light-rays to which the human
retina does not react, and perhaps others
to which camera-plates and -film are not
sensitive. It would seem to follow that
no substance, however thick, can be any
more than a filter for sunlight, and that
at least some of the rays penetrate the
deepest of oceans and even the earth it-
self. If some genius in photographic re-
search can evolve a detector for those
rays, Beebe and his colleagues will, no
doubt, record much that is completely
new to science in those very dark-black
undersea regions.

“Blossom”: The shoeing-smith and his
helper were having trouble in getting 4he
wily old nag to take the weight off a fore-
leg. Having been absorbing those pars
on “chestnuts” lately I suggested that
“the tubercle representing the coarcoid
bone might be used to induce Neddy to
lift his leg without having to be ear-
basfied.” When the smith recovered some-
what from the shock, he said —“Look,
use any cockeyed bone you like, but if
that blank’ll lift his leg short of him
being hoisted with a block and tackle. I’ll
give up the booze.” But I passed on a tip
I’d got—he put his hand on the inside of
Dobbin’s leg, took the chestnut in a ver-
tical direction between thumb and fore-
finger and exerted gentle but increasing
pressure as directed —the horse’s hoof
came up even as predicted. The boss
says it never fails.
« * * *
“B. A. Ker”: I don’t dare think of
what Bruce would have done to his
enemies if he had taken as his object-
lesson an Australian meat-ant instead of
a Scotch spider. The ant that brightened
up my lunch-hour had attempted a short-
cut across a new sheet of corrugated-iron
that lay on the grass, Bruce’s spider fell
down three times ; that ant, carrying his
heavy burden of meat, slipped back 18
times ih one corrugation! But his
mad-brained rush was just as vigorous
in the nineteenth attempt as it had been
at the first. This time the load slipped in
his grip, pulling him sideways and caus-
ing him to take the ascent at a more acute
angle. He was over the top, down the
’ valley and halfway up the next corruga-
tion with the impetus of the one burst of
energy. Alas, he slipped back again!
The accident had taught him nothing.
The unsuccessful attempts reached the
twenties before a shifting cargo again
diverted his course and inadvertently
brought success. Two ridges were crossed
in that rush. Then for six minutes by the
watch the insect raced madly at the slope,
slipped down, raced up again, etc. . . .
And not once did the frantic, headlong
pace ease ; nor did the idea of taking the
line of least resistance —along the valley
—occur to the madcap toiler. Patience
might be a virtue, and perseverance an
admirable quality, but a little laziness and
low cunning sometimes seem to get better
results.

“G. 1.”: Was adjusting the tractor, and
every time the engine stopped the new
hand rushed in to crank her. This suited
me, and after a few starts I remarked
that he was a good hand at cranking.
Breathing heavily he replied: “Yeah, I
once cranked a T-model Ford till it
boiled! ”

“R”: The strange marine object
seen by “E.R.G.S.” (B. 10/3/’4B) was ho
“sea - cucumber,” which are mostly
sausage-shaped creatures, more or less
obese, with a mouth at one end sur-
rounded with branched or shieldlike re-
tractile tentacles. They include trepang,
chalkfish and the like. What he describes
is undoubtedly the egg-mass of some large
univalve mollusc. Included in this species
of Strombus are the conch and bailer
shells, which all deposit their eggs en-
closed in capsules, adhering together ; but
the shape of the mass and also the former
differ. The “open-spiral type of shell”
found in the capsules is common to the
young of various univalves, their specific
shape and coloring being acquired later.
The egg-mass of a large bailer-shell
found here at Moreton Bay (Q.) is similar
in size and proportions to a pineapple,
color yellowish green, and translucent.
The capsules are conical and form a close
spiral with their points inwards so as to
leave a hollow “core” down the centre.
The exterior of the mass is smooth with
perforations marking where the cap-
sules are glued together.

“Flip”: When he sighted Alf s pale dial
and jellied knees, Bung started pumping
the high-octane. Refuelled and looking
better, the patient finally found his voice
and told us, “About a week ago I was
going so fast down Steeple Hill that I
had a bend in the windscreen and the
wheels were only touching down every
20 yards. When I put on the brakes they
gave a smoky sort of yelp, so I picked
the lightest bit of timber in sight and
swung into it. Later, when I came into
town, I pulled up at that garage on
Bombina-avenue. The bloke told me that
neither my nose nor the bumper-bar were
broken, but that the car could do with a
complete overhaul. Reckoned he took
pride in his work, that he had diplomas,
and that crook brakes were his specialty.
This morning when I went back to collect
the car he told me the whole trouble
was in the brake-linings, and that he
never liked to give a car back until he’d
tested it properly with the owner. So
we drove up that hill on the south bank
to try her out. The old bus was doing
50 when he slammed ’em on. That only
seemed to make us go a bit faster, and as
there was a timber-truck dead ahead, I
grabbed the wheel and swung her off the
road. We settled down in about six feet
of water. When the mechanic came to
the surface he gasped: ‘No—it couldn’t
have been the linings. Might be one of
the connections.’ But there’s no need to
worry. I’ll write to the agents in the city
—they’ll always give you advice.”
TANK STREAM.
In Hamilton-street the other day
I saw a man all black with grime;
In the dim dusk he looked a grey
Hobgoblin from some olden time.
Out of a manhole dark he rose
And I took heart to challenge him,
“On what mysterious purpose goes
A man to depths so dark and grim?”
“From Moore Park swamps to Sydney Cove
The Tank Stream flowed where sheoaks sighed,
With skies of cloudy blue above,
Past Strawberry Hills,” that man replied;
“Till in the village by the bay
In rusty tanks, as treasure trove,
Some water stayed, some flowed away
Into the swamp by Sydney Cove.
“And still it flows!” —my grimy friend
Offered to take me down; and there
The old Tank Stream, by buried bend
Where once bird-music filled the air
And now the traffic’s thunder shakes
In waters prisoned as they rove
Far down where never daylight breaks,
Still wandered on to Sydney Cove.

"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO
GARZCOS."
CATTLE AT SYDNEY ROYAL.
“Bulago”: Entries in every
breed showed a healthy increase
on last year with the exception
of Polled Herefords, and they
were not far behind. Shorthorn
quality was very high, although
one or two well-known studs
were missing. Newcomers
showed some promising cattle,
and there was no tail. Coonong
did not figure quite so promi-
nently as usual, but the high
standard it imposed a decade ago
is being maintained, and it won
the male championship vhth
Coonong 0.8. E., a deep-red bull,
very square and low-set and a
wonderful handler. The strong
influence of Coonong in the
pedigrees of prizewinners from
other studs was noteworthy.
Junior and reserve junior bulls
and Woomargama’s champion
cow were all by Coonong bulls,
and many other ribbon-winners
had Coonong ancestry.
The Coonong champion was
closely challenged by a five-year-
old red-roan import, Tarvas
Mandarin, from Turanville. His
looks were supported by the per-
sistent success of his progeny in
many classes. Among his stock
is Turanville Ruby’s Gift 29th, a
beautiful roan heifer that became
junior and senior reserve
champion.
Polled Shorthorns have main-
tained a steady increase in
quality. Several new studs did
remarkably well; Merryville in
particular put up a fine effort.
However, as must be ex-
pected in a comparatively new
type, there is a considerable lack
of uniformity, and a tail cannot
be eliminated entirely. The tops
were remarkably good, and rib-
bons were well distributed. A
neat roan from Antrim won the
championship from Merryville
Royal Domino, who, although
of greater scale, did not move
so well as the younger bull. A
dark roan, Bogan Edward, won
the junior ribbon from Wen-
douree Red Robbie. Female
finalists; were excellent, and
Netherby heifers in particular
were outstanding. Champion
and junior champion were from
the Queensland stud, with re-
serves to Wendouree and Bogan.
That line-up of trim polled
heifers augurs well for the
future of the breed.
Herefords had 324 entries
from 20 studs; one class, for
bulls 15-18 months, paraded 42
entrants. The winner was
Windsor Bachelor, a splendidly-
finished bull full of quality that
later won the junior champion-
ship, As usual. Golf Hill was
well to the fore. Although its
yearling. Dispenser, had to yield
the championship to Bexley
Demonstrator, who had the ad-
vantage in years and scale, the
younger bull was open reserve,
and Golf Hill could share the
Bexley triumph, having sired the
champion.
Golf Hill scored indirectly in
the female championships.
Timor Lively Seventh, a young
champion of almost perfect con-
formation, was sired by a Golf
“He’s a bit inexperienced."
Hill bull. Herbert Park Molly,
the reserve, ran her very close.
One of the strongest classes was
for heifers 15-18 months, a
batch of youngsters of high
promise,. Ribbons went to Bex-
ley Canssima 22nd, Fern Hill
Matchless 13th and Red Hill
Chloe Sixth in that order, and
first and second beat all others
for the junior championships.
There was a tail in the Hereford
section, particularly in the novice
classes, but the tops, while con-
taining nothing sensational, were
of as high a standard as Sydney
has seen.
Although entries were fewer
than last year. Polled Herefords
attracted a dozen studs, includ-
ing newcomers from Victoria.
Here was a wide range in
quality, but the tops showed a
steady improvement. Once
again the Milton cattle were out-
standing and won seven out of
eight ribbons. One of them, the
reserve bull, is now owned by
K. G. Luke, of Victoria, and
the smaller, more compact Mil-
ton Veteran, who had already
taken the junior championship,
only beat his bigger rival after
a prolonged judging. Junior re-
serve went to Kildrummie Paul,
second in his class to the Milton
bull.
The females from the Hordern
stud were unbeatable, and, in
all, Milton had the distinction of
winning open and junior male
championships with the same
bull and both female champion-
ships with the same heifer. In-
terest in the polled breed in-
creases each year, and as time
and the skill of studmasters effect
a steady improvement, their
general use in commercial herds
will increase.
Only four breeders competed
for Devon honors. Most rib-
bons went to Havilah, a goodly
share to Ban Ban, Aubyn Vale
and Table Top. Ban Ban’s
three-year-old Searchlight was
champion over Havilah Forester,
junior champ., jun. reserve going
to Table Top Roger. In the
' female classes Havilah was hard
to beat, winning most of the
blue ribbons and three of the
four championships. The excep-
tion was the reserve champion-
ship, which went to a shapely
Queensland-bred cow now in the
Ban Ban stud. Devons deserve
more support than they get.
They are particularly suited to
Australian conditions, and stud-
masters deserve praise for the
high standard they maintain.
Aberdeen-Angus classes pro-
duced close contests, and honors
were well distributed. Booroo-
mooka’s champion of last year
had to give way to the Depart-
ment of Agriculture’s imported
Erison of Harviestoun. Both
were just a bit over-conditioned,
but there is no doubt of the
champion’s quality. A shapely
young Kahlua bull made a bold
bid for junior honors, but
Narrangullen Eminence had a
slight advantage in age. Some
recently - imported animals
offered a contrast with the locals,
showing how the latter have
settled down into a type. Most
importations were entered by
the N.S.W. Department of Agri-
culture and originated from
U.S.A., Canada and Scotland.
Nevertheless, Sir Joshua Ross:
Taylor, who came from Scot-
land to judge, showed a general
preference for the locally-bred.
Booroomooka’s female cham-
pion, Noon, is a beautifully-pro-
portioned Jour-year-old cow
with plenty of scale. A Wallah
cow took the reserve ribbon.
Two very promising heifers from
Kahlua Anthonette Seventh
and Thirza Third —won against
a strong field. Abington and
Narrangullen scored well in
various classes and several newer
competitors put up a commend-
able showing.
Red Poll competition was
again limited. The type of en-
tries of this dual-purpose breed
suggests that breeders are swing-
ing more toward beef than milk.
Recently an English Red Poll
created a record for milk pro-
duction. Few of those shown in
Sydney could compete with an
average Ayrshire or Illawarra
for milking qualifies. Bunda-
leer and Mt. Parry provided
most of the competition.
Cattle Sales.
“Bulago”: A seller’s year, with
cattle prices booming and the imme-
diate future assured, gave chances to
improve the herd and reduce Mr.
Chifley’s rake-off. These sales should
encourage studmasters to import.
How much it is needed is shown by
the frank statements of the two
famous judges who officiated. They
praised our tops, but found the aver-
age quality disappointing.
Sales began with Aberdeen-Angus,
where only one made less than
lOOgns. Several reserves were too
high and animals were passed in.
Top price was 860gns. for Kahlua
Norman, a nice 18-months-old winner.
Average per head was about 30 p.c.
better than last year.
Shorthorns showed an even greater
increase, average for bulls being
slightly over 200gns. Demand for
stock from well-known studs was very
keen, and even newcomers, who
normally have a thin time on their
Sydney debut, got satisfactory prices.
The champion, Coonong 0.8. E., was
passed in at 1 lOOgns., but a stable-
mate, Coonong Quixotic, who barely
ran into a place at the show, made
top Shorthorn price of 1210gns. The
only other Shorthorn to sell at four
figures was Turanville Master Crown
3rd, who went to a Tasmanian buyer
at lOOOgns. Other good prices were
410gns. for a Woomargama yearling,
400gns. for Legacy, a white from
Calool, 435 for Coonong Quiberon,
500 for a well-bred red bull, Daunt-
less Butterscotch, and the junior
champion white bull, Banool Grand,
525gns. Shorthorn females found a
ready market. A red Coonong heifer
topped the sale at 355gns.
Among the Poll Shorthorns
Antrim Prince Peter, the cham-
pion, was passed in at 1400gns.,
but nothing else reached half of
that figure. Females sold well, top
prices being 260gns. each for a
Netherby and a Wendouree heifer and
240 each for two poll heifers from
Bogan.
Herefords realised record figures.
Golf Hill had an excellent sale, nine
animals averaging over £9OO a head.
A record of 2500gns. was paid for
the junior and reserve open champion,
Golf Hill Dispenser. Other good
figures were 820gns. for another Golf
Hill bull, lOOOgns. for a Timor huh’
750gns. to Cuppacumbalong and
1350gns. for a bull from Bexley.
Another record price of 1125gns.
was paid for a South Boorook heifer,
rising two years and in calf to the
imported bull, Vern Milton. In spite
of the keen demand for Hereford
females many bids failed to reach
owners’ reserves.
Polled Herefords were quickly
snapped up at the best all-round
prices recorded for the breed in Aus-
tralia. The Milton cattle in particu-
lar were eagerly sought, and the classy
little bull that won open and junior
championships, Milton Veteran,
brought 1250gns. Another young
bull from the same stud sold at
lOOOgns. Prices and clearances of
females were very good.
Demand for Devons was confined
to high-quality animals. Havilah
Devons sold well, but some bulls from
other studs changed hands at herd
bull prices. The champion, Ban Ban
Searchlight, was passed in at 400gns.
Sales ended with Red Polls and
buyers were inclined to discriminate.
Many animals were sub-standard and
should not have been sent to Sydney.
3'undaleer refused a bid of 4(XJgns.
for one but accepted 165gns. for the
res. champion bull. Sellers’ reserves
on , many animals were higher than
buyers were prepared to pay.
Judging by their appearance, quite
a few animals of various breeds came
straight from the paddock and con-
trasted unfavorably with the general
run of sleek, well-prepared animals.
Nevertheless, these cattle may prove
a much safer buy, as faults can be
picked easily and are not camouflaged
under a cushion of fat. But show
conditions make no allowance for this,
and we have become so accustomed
to stock at the peak of preparation
that we are apt to look with dis-
paragement on anything below that
standard. However, it is doubtful
whether the provision of special grass-
fed classes at the Show would meet
with the success that some breedeis
imagine, as there are too many pos-
sible complications. Any “grass-fed”
picnic race-meeting is proof of that.
In the meantime, it looks as though
stock for show-sales must be pre-
pared thoroughly for the occasion,
while the man who wants to see
them under normal conditions will
still have to inspect in the paddock.
Compost and Disease.
•‘Sarina”: So codlin-moth in
apples may be controlled by
feeding the trees plenty of com-
post (B. 10/3/’4B). Maybe
with apples, but having had ex-
perience with tomatoes and other
fruits I doubt it. Until I got
wise I used to grow luxuriant
tomato-bushes up to fruiting
stage on a diet of cane trash,
straw and horse-manure com-
post with an occasional sprink-
ling of blood and bone. Promptly

DOGS NEED CARE
To keep your dog healthy and fit you
should watch for danger signs that show
when he is out of sorts and needs atten-

if his nose is warm and he is moody,
listless or off his food, he is probably
suffering from digestive disorders that pro-
duce these symptoms. Start giving him

The ELASTRATOR Castrator and
Toiler is an instrument for plac-
ing an extremely strong rubber
ring over the purse of a lamb or
calf, imprisoning the testicles,
completely cutting off the blood
circulation. In a few weeks the
purse dries up, atrophies and
falls off, leaving only a small,
completely healed scar.
ELASTRATION means that lambs and
calves lose no blood and suffer no set-
back. There is no open wound for germs
to attack, and the risk of flystrike is
minimised. ELASTRATION can be per-
formed in the same yards every year,
and carried out safely under bad wea-
ther conditions without ill effects.

cent, of the vines died off —
tomato-mite. But when I turned
to lime-sulphur as a spray my
tomatoes stayed healthy.
My orange-trees, pawpaws
and passions get the refuse from
the stable and the fallen leaves
from the fig-tree that overhangs
it, plus wood-ashes and fowl
manure. The citrus-trees suffer
(unless sprayed at intervals)
from sooty mould and wax
scale. The ripe fruit is preyed
upon by fruit-flies, moths and
fruit-sucking bugs. Borers have
to be watched for in the
branches. The compost doesn’t
prevent powdery mildew and
foot-rot in the pawpaws nor
scab and woodiness in the pas-
sions. All four diseases are of
fungoid origin. It is a mistake
to believe that healthy trees
cannot be injured by parasites or
disease.
Concrete Outback.
“Mulga”: It is cheap, easy to
use and permanent if laid
correctly. While a rich mixture
and good mixing are important,
they are not the whole. Farmers
often neglect necessary points.
Sand must be clean and sharp,
containing no vegetable matter.
A good test is to sprinkle lightly
a handful into water; if any
quantity floats the sand is not
suitable. When using old iron
for reinforcement see that all
paint is burnt from it. Use
clean water. If in the hot-bore
country see that the water is
cold ; if there is a heavy mineral
content in the bore change if
possible to rainwater. Cover
the work with sand or bags and
keep wet for a few days,
If it is required to affix a
hinge, staple or other gadget to
concrete don’t gouge a hole and
drive a wooden peg in. Tap
out the hole with a drill and
place a bolt-head into it; the
head acts as an anchor, the pro-
truding thread will take a nut.
Wrap around the stem lightly a
thin strip of sheet-lead; then,
with a piece of piping to fit over
the bolt and a mallet, beat the
lead in, adding more until the
cavity is filled. Nothing short
of breaking the concrete will
move an object so caulked. When
laying cement on open ground
subject to great expansion and
contraction spread 3in. of sand,
wetting it before the cement is
laid. This acts as a cushion, tak-
ing the contraction and expan-
sion of the ground. In colored
work, such as tesselated paths, a
top layer of about £in. of pig-
mented cement is adequate. One
in 12 of color will give good
results. Always use a mineral
pigment.
Hints for the Farm.
“Myrrhee”: If a horse shows
signs of lice, clip him and work
into the skin a kerosene emul-
sion or a nicotine sulphate solu-
tion. Repeat in two weeks to
kill the lice hatched from eggs
not destroyed by the first appli-
cation. Kerosene emulsion:
lib. of soft soap in one gallon
of hot water, stir in one pint of
kerosene as it cools. Nicotine
solution: Stir loz. of nicotine
sulphate in one gallon of soapy
water. Keep the horse well-
groomed and well-fed.
“C.A.A.”: Cows’ hooves
should be cut back periodically.
If cutters are not available hold
the hoof up firmly and cut off
the overgrown part with a good-
chtting meat-saw, then trim the
points back with a wood-rasp.
“Billjim”: Late southern
tomatoes will benefit by a tea-
spoonful of sulphate of ammonia
per plant. Dress all winter
vegetables with 4-1 super, and
ammonia in bands on each side
of the plants, loz. per yard per
row.
“Nubis”: Oil and resin (B.
3/3/’4B) is a very good “stick-
fast” for slipping belts, but
sump-oil as recommended by
“Oiler” is not altogether satis-
factory. A vegetable oil, such
as brake fluid (castor-oil), gives
better results, as mineral oils are
liable to cause degeneration of
the belts, particularly fabric
ones.
“Nedher”: There’s often a
job on the farm which requires
the use of glue. A glue, proof
against both fire and water, may
be made by mixing a handful
of quicklime with four ounces
of linseed-oil, boiling it to a
good thickness. Pour it on to a
tin plate and stand in the shade
to dry. It is rendered fit for
use by boiling over the fire in
the usual way. An air- and
water-tight cqment for casks and
cisterns may be made from eight
parts of melted glue and four
parts of linseed-oil boiled into
a varnish with litharge. It
hardens in 48 hours.
“Sarina”: Charcoal is a
known antidote for strychnine-
poisoning (B, 3/3/’4B), but it
pays to follow it up with a
strong emetic of mustard and
warm water. Bone charcoal is
the best; a few ounces of it
along with a small tin of mustard
should always be kept handy in
the medicine-chest. Mix an
ounce of charcoal with water.
“K.L.MI”: When repairing
leaks in a roof or tank with any
of the plastic compounds now
available, brush petrol or methy-
lated spirits lightly over the
finished joint and ignite the
spirit before it evaporates. The
heat thus applied ensures that
the molten material runs into the
crevices, making a good seal.
Cracked tiles can be made water-
tight in this way, working on
both sides.

Whatever your age, however long you have
worn glasses, or your eyes have troubled
you, Eye Culture can help you. Short
sight—long sight—old-age sight—turned,
tired or strained eyes—glare—headaches
—in fact, almost any eye trouble or dis-
comfort can be remedied by Eye Culture.
NO APPEIANCES, EYE DROPS
OR DRUGS.
Just a simple course of Eye Culture,
which removes congestion from the tissues
and strengthens strained, weakened eye
muscles. This means that soon—usually
from two to six weeks—the eyes com-
mence to improve and glasses become un-
necessary as the eyes gradually regain
their lost vitality and strength.
Eye Culture is more than just eye exer-
cises—it is a treatment based on the
training of the eyes in relation to the
whole system. It is backed by over 16
years’ practice in Australia, and is based
upon commonsense laws of nature. Glasses
weaken the eyes—Eye Culture strengthens
them. Isn’t that what you want?

D. H. E.
Intelligence Test for
Bureaucrats.
1. —As Chairman of the Beet-
root Board you find that at the
end of the first year of opera-
tions a loss of only £64,000 has
been achieved. The pointedly
patronising attitude adopted by
the chairmen of various other
boards, none of which has an
annual loss of less than £140,000,
you find intolerable, and drastic
remedial measures are indicated.
You are aware, of course, of
the principle obtaining in such
matters that the higher the
annual loss you can show the
greater likelihood of your salary
being substantially raised. This
higher loss can best be guaran-
teed by augmenting the staff
150 p.c. immediately. Taking
all circumstances into account,
would you endeavor to show a
profit on next year’s operations
by pursuing a policy of staff
economy?
2. —Pursuant to the foregoing
question. Assuming, purely for
purposes of this question, that
you decide on the staff-augmen-
tation method. By a very
strange coincidence the exact
number by which you propose
to increase the clerical staff is
available from the constituency
of the particular Minister upon
whose special recommendation
you were appointed. They com-
prise s.p. bookies, billiard-
markers, laborers, wharfies, Com-
munist organisers, etc., but none
with any previous clerical ex-
perience. Give at least 12 rea-
sons why you would consider
their appointment to the per-
manent staff would greatly in-
crease the efficiency of the
Board’s working.
3. —A few months before the
“Labor” Government is due to
go to the country your staff, by
Government direction, is sud-
denly increased from 338 to
790, although the taking-over of
portion of your board’s activi-
ties by another newly-created
board has cut the work corres-
pondingly. A prominent
“Labor” organiser, a close
friend of the Minister,
approaches you with a request
that you allow him to address
the staff on the dangers that
would attend the defeat of the
“Government,” particularly as
to the abolition of various
boards, with the awful possibility
that some of the staff might
have to go to work. A strict
departmental rule, however, for-
bids the holding of meetings.
Would you consider, purely in
the interests of fair play, point-
ing out to the organiser that
there is nothing to stop him
from speaking privately to each
of the staff in turn?
4. —The special outside staff
you put on to resolve the ques-
tion has reported, after several
months touring rural areas, that
the 27 questions on blue form
148, which the public applying
for permits for the commodity
your department controls must
fill in in sextuplicate, takes on
an average only 47 minutes, 33
seconds to complete. You there-
fore determine to add two more
vital questions, viz.: (a) Did your
great-grandparents live in (1) a
stone cottage and/or house, (2)
“Come on out, Ted; you've been in smoke long enough.”
brick, (3) weatherboard, (4) slab
and bark, (5) wattle and daub,
(6) admixture of any or all of
foregoing; and ( b ) What pro-
portion of wallspace do you
devote to (1) oil-paintings, (2)
watercolors, (3) etchings, (4)
bevelled mirrors, (5) photos of
boxers and/or racehorses and/or
relatives (close, near, distant, in
that order)? You therefore put
iij an order on the Government
Printer for 100,000 of the
amended Iforms. Explain the
steps you would take to dispose
of the 80,000 old forms still
held and thus rendered useless.
5. —A member of the public
who has protested against get-
ting no attention after having
waited for two and a half hours,
though for at least one hour
three clerks were discussing the
races, has been curtly informed
by a clerk that he will be at-
tended to when it suits him (the
clerk), and not before. The
Personal Clerk to your Private
Clerk has been seen by the
aggrieved one, and he reports
the occurrence to you. Some
action is obviously necessary in
the interests of discipline. Sub-
mit the reply you would make
to the complainant, and in
stressing the paucity of his rights
as a supplicant say why you
consider it a damnable thing
that your staff should be sub-
mitted to the arrogance of the
public, whose only privilege is
to pay their salaries.
6.—The building your board
occupies is at least 15 years old
and the pattern of the door-
handles annoys you. A fine new
building has just been completed
for a private firm. Draft the
demand you would make to the
Minister to have the new build-
ing commandeered for use of
the board.

Politicians
A larger Federal Parliament is un-
necessary, but what is needed is a better
conception by the public of the duties
and obligations of Ms.P.
The first duties of an M.P. should be
to frame the laws of the country, initiate
legislation, advance constructive ideas,
intelligently criticise matters brought be-
fore the House for consideration and
generally look to the social, physical and
spiritual wellbeing of the people.
Unfortunately, the member of today is
• expected to do something of immediate
tangible benefit for his constituents to
retain their goodwill and votes. He is
expected to open bazaars, visit race-
meetings, appear at social functions and,
with his wife, do the right thing on all
occasions. Nor are these the worst
features. The average member receives
250-300 letters a week, 95 per cent, con-
taining requests for permits for new
cars, for jobs, for financial assistance and
a thousand other things. Neglect of all
such solicitations, the majority of which
are unwarranted, has the penality of de-
feat at the next election unless the
member has a blue-ribbon seat.
We don’t need more politicians. We
need a different outlook by the people
on what a member’s duties should in-
volve. Then we might get legislators less
dominated by fear of defeat at the elec-
tions, and more capable of giving us
thoughtful, impartial and constructive
government.—C. B. M. (N.S.W.).
Queensland Roads
The Queensland rail strike emphasises
the isolation of some of the States’ main
settlements from each other, and from
southern sources of supply.
The Bruce Highway, so permanent and
solid in South Queensland, trails off
north of Rockhampton to the worst of
bush tracks. It is so bad that truck
convoys to Mackay had to take the alter-
native route many miles west, through
Clermont, to bring badly-needed fresh
fruit from Rockhampton,
Coastal Queensland, which should be
one of the most productive belts in Aus-
tralia, hasn’t one good arterial road;
individual centres are similarly separated
by bad roads.
Ratepayers each year see gangs “do-
ing-up” roads which have suffered from
hard use and heavy rain; in most cases
the “doing-up” consists merely of restor-
ing roads to their former state, from
which they easily deteriorate again.
Councils would willingly build more
durable roads, but they need more money.
State and Federal Governments either
cannot, or will not, provide the cash, so
the farmer continues to suffer. But he
is justifiably annoyed when he calculates
the miles of sound roadway he could have
had with the money spent on years of
recurrent patching.—K. W. M, (Q.).
Road and Rail
A Melbourne writer who contributes
a weekly column to our Sunday paper
credits Queensland Premier Hanlon with
a suggestion to “scrap Queensland’s
rickety, war-tom railways and replace
them with contract road services requiring
no public capital outlay and State air-
lines.” I doubt that Hanlon suggested
anything of the kind —such a scheme
might break the present strike, but it
would also break the State of Queens-
land.
Queensland taxpayers have some £5O
million invested in their State transport
system, and on that outlay there are
fixed charges amounting to nearly £2
million to be met annually. In normal
times the railways contribute a consider-
able amount towards those charges, the
balance, wrongly and repeatedly called a
loss, representing work done at less than
cost in the interest of various sections of
the community. Scrap the railways and
you pass all the burden to the taxpayers
with no compensation in the way of cheap
transport.
It’s an equally popular fallacy that by
scrapping railways you’d get rid of the
militant unionist, the impersonal touch
of large Government departments and
transport “strangulation.” The only type
of carrier which could replace the railway
is one or more large corporations con-
tracting to handle all traffic, not merely
the “cream,” offering in each district.
They would require an enormous staff
of union employees working under all the
frivqlous and costly awards with which
the railways are plagued. They would
need a costly reserve of men and vehicles
to handle peak traffic, they would have all
the overheads of any large business and,
to provide a dependable and cheap service
in less profitable areas, they would need
to be protected by legislation from com-
petition. Your local carrier would have
no place in the New Order.
The Queensland railway is not parti-
cularly cheap because of its very low
traffic density, the all-in cost being about
2d. per ton-mile, but when that density
improves, as it must with rising popu-
lation, that rate can be cut in half. That
is the greatest advantage of the rail
method. Road transport has no such
advantage, its minimum cost being ob-
tained with the largest practicable single
unit. The size of that has reached its
economic limit in the U.S.A. and it is still
well under the capacity of a single-rail
vehicle. Its use calls for something like
a super-highway to which it is confined
almost as rigidly as any train, is to its
track. Whether the contract carriers
themselves would be expected to rebuild
the Queensland road system to these
standards, or whether the taxpayer would
be happy to do so, is a moot point.
State airways sound good if you’re not
worried about the dollar problem. They
“ Why don’t you answer me, darling?”
could bring any part of the State within
a few hours of Brisbane. Unfortunately
their cost in Australia appears to be
round 12 times the rail cost per ton-mile,
and that only when the taxpayer provides
all the static equipment.— Transporticus
(Singapore).
The Public Service
“Waddlin’ Willie” (B. 17/3/’4B) should
know that neither “Labor” nor any other
“political philosophy” classifies temporary
employees in the Commonwealth public
service. Permanent status is governed
purely and simply by the Commonwealth
Public Service Act. Under that Act
officers, to be eligible for permanent
appointment to the third division (clerical),
must pass an examination roughly equal
to matriculation. Fourth-division (general)
officers are appointed after examinations
of a very simple standard held to recruit
various branches and designations—tele-
graph messengers, clerical assistants, tele-
phonists, etc.
As the great majority of fourth-division
members are permanent, I take it
“W.W.’s” moan is directed at the woes
of third-division temporaries. Well, some
qualification must exist, and the examina-
tion is there. I take it his 109 25-year
men either didn’t know about it, or
couldn’t pass it.
A long fist of examinations, ranging as
low as Intermediate standard, is embodied
in the Act, and passing any one of them
any time renders any returned soldier
eligible for permanent appointment to the
third division up to the age of 51. I’ve
never known one who applied to be
knocked back. Moreover, a returned
soldier who has been employed in a State
public service in any capacity is also
eligible for permanency in the third
division.
In the fourth division, two years’ con-
tinuous temporary service entitles a re-
turned soldier to permanency. For a
non-retumed soldier there is only one way
in, except in very exceptional cases, and
that is by passing the Public Service ex-
amination before he is too old. The Act
has always embodied strict preference in
employment to returned soldiers, and the
way is made easier for them by assum-
ing that they may have missed being
educated for the Public Service ex-
amination, and the opportunities of sitting
for it. A non-retumed-spldier who has
been continuously employed for 25 years
should have been young enough when he
started to sit for the examination, and if
he intended to make the public service
his career he should have had a crack at
it.
“W.W.” should also know that a tem-
porary employee who has more than five
years’ continuous service is eligible to
apply under the Commonwealth Superan-
nuation Act for superannuation benefits,
and that such benefits can be granted
subject to a certificate from his chief
officer that he will be employed for at
least 10 years. Naturally, this is rather
difficult for a chief officer to certify, but
there are many temporary employees of
the Commonwealth public service con-
tributing to the superannuation fund and
eligible for benefits under the Act.
I was permanently appointed to the
service at the age of 44, as a returned
soldier, after having matriculated at that
age. I have a large sympathy for temps,
having been one, and I have known a few
who were amazingly efficient. I have
tried to tolerate many who, as clerks,
weren’t worth five-bob-a-week in a
stokehold. Most of the efficient ones
become permanent, if eligible, and if not
get out into something which offers them
a future.—W. E. (N.S.W.).
I joined the Commonwealth public
service as a permanent by examination in
1923, the year the superannuation scheme
came into being, and from then untit
. 1947 I was slugged about £4OO (13s.
a fortnight) to enable me to draw £5 a
fortnight on retirement.
If I had been a temporary there would
not have been any deductions from my
pay for superannuation, but on retire-
ment my wife and I would have received
£7 10s. per fortnight between us as old-
age pensioners.—Re-Tyred (Q.).
r . .
Communist Meeting
CoWra (N.S.W.) still feels a glow of
pride about that Communist meeting (B.
24/3/’4B). Previously, townspeople had
poked their heads in the door, seen a
miserable half-dozen huddled in the body
of the hall listening to the usual harangue
and left them to stew in their own juice.
This time a couple of dozen decided
to meet them at their own game under
the proper rules of public meeting. There
was no attempt at shouting down or any
other sort of larrikinism. As the men
entered the speaker launched straight into
her speech. America seems to be the
current target, “imperialist Britain” even
getting a word of Communist sympathy
for its sufferings at the hand of its
great friend.
Question-time came, and an ex-
serviceman - solicitor moved an ex-
pression of Communist loyalty to the
throne and constitution. The speaker was
right on the ball and “answered the
question” before the motion was even
seconded. Someone else jumped up and
asked a string of questions, a well-meant
effort, but questions are meat and drink
to these people.
The chairman missed his chance of de-
claring the meeting closed, and Fred Hall
was on his feet.
Hall: “I move that this meeting, called
by the Communist party of Australia, re-
quest the Federal Government to declare
the Communist party an illegal organisa-
tion.”
An ex-Kokoda M.C.: “I second that.”
Chairman; “You can only ask ques-
tions.”
Hall: “This is a public meeting; I
have the right to move a motion. Will
you kindly put it to the meeting?”
Chairman: “No.”
Hall: “Right, I’ll put it myself. All
those in favor?” (A forest of hands.)
“Against? I declare it carried.”
The speaker had a few sharp words
to say on the question of people being
so evil as to pack a Communist meeting,
but everyone started to get up and walk
off. Barry Poignand, another ex-service-
man, dived to the piano and the Com-
munist party’s meeting finished with a
full-throated National Anthem. — Khasi
Rokok (N.S.W.).
The R.A.N.
Ond of the least publicised and most
interesting jobs our Navy is doing is
indicated by a report that sloop Lachlan,
after extensive surveying duties in n.-w.
Australian waters, is paying-off into re-
serve in Sydney.
Around Darwin, down past Broome,
into King’s Sound, up Spencer’s Gulf in
the northern “wet,” Lachlan sailors spent
their days with sounding over reefs, camp-
ing for weeks on a headland that’s
hardly known a white man, rigging tide-
marks and triangulation stations, servic-
ing lonely lights, shooting crocodiles,
working hard in shorts and boots, feeding
well and living like kings on their six
weeks’ leave down south.
With only two surveying ships in com-
mission and an estimated 100 years’ sur-
veying required round Australian coasts,
the paying-off of a third ship can mean
only one thing—shortage of men. The
Government should publicise naval life as
it is, its interest and variety, comrade-
ship and loyalty, instead of the only
“attraction” it has to date offered—con-
ditions of pay.
Then ships would be at sea in com-
mission, instead of two cruisers laid up
at Garden Island, half a flotilla of de-
stroyers ahead of them, and droves of
frigates and corvettes rusting in Williams-
town and Geelong.—Macnell (N.S.W.).
Root of the Matter
We are approaching the third Anzac
Day since the end of the war and no cam-
paign stars or medals have been issued,
although it is going on for eight years
since some of us qualified ior the Africa
Star. What mugs we were not to stay
at home and qualify for gold passes. We’d
have got them the day we qualified.—
Anna Muskeen (Vic.).
The working-class solidarity of which
Communists prate has no reality. Those
in skilled trades regard themselves as
a cut above semi-skilled workers, and
many of the latter take the same attitude
towards the “unskilled” man. Apart
from such incipient class-distinction, how
much consideration is shown by workers
contemplating a strike, for others not
likely to be involved, but who may be
adversely affected? — Tom (N.S.W.).
I’ve read The Bulletin for 30 years
and enjoyed its anecdotes and witticisms
about hundreds of Australian types —
farmers, swaggies, shearers, parsons,
lawyers, publicans, politicians, jockeys,
bookmakers, civil servants, actors, city
clerks, spielers, poets and artists. But I
search my memory in vain for anything
about the coalminer. Plenty about the
goldminer, the prospector, and the Cousin
Jacks at Wallaroo, but nothing to help me
see the coalminer apart from his trade-
union. Does he play games, write to the
papers, fall in love, collect stamps, back
losers, grow cabbages or send his kids to
college? Does anybody know? — En-
QUIRENDUM (W.A.).
Why should 9500 voters of the A.C.T.
be without a vote? The principle was
wrong from the beginning. It may have
been impossible for the Territory to have
a representative all to itself, but provi-
sion should have been made from the
first for its inclusion in some other elec-
torate. It has its own elected council,
of course; so have Sydney and Bourke,
The proposal to give the A.C.T. a repre-
sentative with voting power limited to
matters directly connected with it, as is
the case with the N.T., is only extending a
very undemocratic precedent. Doesn’t
everything that happens in Australia
concern every citizen of the Common-
wealth?—G. A. B. (N.S.W.).
A participant wrote to me of that meet-
ing of 5000 people at Bundaberg (B.
17/3/’4B) protesting against industrial
lawlessness —“the best meeting ever held
here,” A motion supporting the Queens-
land Government was carried unani-
mously. I couldn’t find any reference to
the meeting in the N, S. Wales dailies, and
I’m wondering why the press refrains
from giving publicity to such an unusually
important and significant event, a striking
occurrence in any part of Australia, but
particularly so in a moderate-sized town.
Surely such a silence only helps the cause
of “industrial lawlessness.” — Old Aus-
tralian (N.S.W.).


Have YOU
sufficient
LIFE ASSURANCE
No man should so overload himself with
assurance that the payment of premiums
may become an embarrassment during his
lifetime.
On the other hand, no man —at least no
man with a dependent family—can afford
to sit back complacently with too little life
assurance. Indeed, the amount of life
assurance that you should have is of
utmost importance. It is YOUR responsi-
bility to see that the total of your policies
will be sufficient to afford your family the
protection that they will need, should the
emergency arise.
Now is the time to make provision for the
future. Not necessarily protection against
the possibility of death only, but provision
for all manner of purposes; the home you
/
intend to build; education for your family;
financial independence in your old age.
You can provide for these things with Life
Assurance. . .Whole of Life Assurance
payable at death, and Endowment Assur-
ance payable at a determined date or at
previous death.
... , V
Examine your situation npw, and decide
how much assurance of both forms you
should have!
A City Mutual Service
City Mutual will welcome the opportunity
of assisting you in your assurance prob-
lems. Our officers will explain the advan-
tages of both types ; will tell you what
premiums ar.e payable, and show you
what you gain with City Mutual Policies.
Remember, when you assure with City
Mutual you assure with an old-established,
wholly mutual Society.
