ST. PATRICK'S CATHEDRAL, ARMACH.
ARMAGH, or Ard-magha, mean-
ing “high .held,” is of great anti-
quarian interest. In the year 448
it was The meeting place of a Synod,
a relic of which is the Book of
Armagh, now in Trinity College,
Dublin. Brian Boru captured
Armagh and was buried here in
1004. Ecclesiastically, Armagh is the
primatial see of all Ireland, and was
originally founded as a see by St.
Patrick about the year 457. The
ancient cathedral was located where
the present Protestant cathedral
stands. The Roman Catholic cathe-
dral, which was begun in 1840 by
Bishop Crully and completed by an
Archbishop Dixon, is shown above,
and is one of Ireland’s most impos-
ing ecclesiastical structures.

AUSTRALIAN ANTHOLOGY.
It may be doubted whether a committee
of archangels could make a completely
satisfactory anthology of poetry. Even
W. B. Yeats was severely—and rightly—
criticised for his Oxford Book of Modern
Verse (which included no poems by Aus-
tralians).
It may even be doubted whether the
sort of anthologies that Australians are
always trying to make, a summary or a
collection of the whole poetic output of
the nation, can ever really do justice to
the authors included. Obviously they do
some harm, though doubtless not per-
manent, to the writers excluded, left to
freeze for ever in the outer darkness of
this or that anthologist’s disapproval.
But those included also suffer some
almost inevitable damage. Within the
scope of Palgrave’s Golden Treasury it
is not possible to represent Shakspeare
by more than a few lyrics and sonnets ;
so that, if the anthology were exported
to Mars, the inhabitants would get a
totally wrong impression of the greatest
of English poets.
And Australian poetry, in particular,
stands in relation to the rest of the world
as the earth to Mars: it is unknown. No
English reader could form a proper esti-
mate, for example, of Kenneth Slessor’s
“Five Visions of Captain Cook” —one of
the great poems of recent times —from
the fragment in H. M. Green’s Modern
Australian Poetry (Melbourne University
Press). You would need not only the
whole of “Five Bells” (which is included)
but the whole of “Captain Cook” and
the whole of “Captain Dobbin” to get
even an inkling of the richness of Slessor’s
production. Nor, though “Bullocky” and
“The Company of Lovers” are included,
could an uninformed reader of Modern
Australian Poetry have any idea of the
passion and splendor that have made
Judith Wright’s poetry, in these two essen-
tials, transcend all other recent writing
in this country.
Palgrave, however, deliberately limited
the scope of his anthology in a way that
did the least possible injustice to the
writers in and out of it. It is a collec-
tion of lyrical poetry only, and so escapes
serious complaint. And this, perhaps—
the anthology deliberately limited and
plainly stated to be so —is the only really
satisfactory form. W. H. Davies put to-
gether a book of the short poems of the
language he liked the best; and that un-
pretentious little volume, made qn that
simple principle, was as charming as it
was unassailable.
Another way out of the difficulty—
since, more or less unsatisfactory as they
always are, we feel that we must have a
national anthology—is the method Louis
Untermeyer used in his big Modern
American Poetry, where each man’s con-
tributions, copious in themselves, were
prefaced by a complete list of his works,
a discussion of them and a biography.
Mr. Green, faced with these and other
problems, has in part attempted to over-
come them in Untermeyer’s way. But
scrappily. There is a short critical pre-
face to the book and, at the end, a very
brief biography of each author, with a
list of books. Both sections are marred by
errors of fact. It was, presumably, only
a compositor’s mistake that attributed
Judith Wright’s “Bullocky” to Frank
Wilmot (“Furnley Maurice”); but the
present writer, to take an example ■natu-
rally near to the heart, was somewhat dis-
concerted to find that several of his books
had, in the list of publications, ceased to
exist. Again, it is stated in the introduc-
tion that Fitz Gerald and are “six
or seven years younger” than W. H.
Auden and Stephen Spender; but Fitz-
Gerald was born in 1902, Slessor in 1901,
and Auden in 1907 and Spender in 1909.
These, it may be, are minor matters.
One would certainly not dispute Mr.
Green’s contention that, though they have
written less, the Australians’- best poems
are “comparable” with the best by the
two English writers. Stephen Spender
has a new book out —Poems of Dedica-
tion (Faber)—and, though it is deep and
delicate work, his elegies for Margaret
Spender have not the impassioned music
of “Five Bells” nor his explorations of
time and memory the profound and sus-
tained strength of “Essay on Memory”
(which Mr. Green reprints in full). As
Mr. Green has observed before, and re-
peats here, there is a “fresh and confident
energy” in Fitz Gerald’s writing not to be
found in the work of overseas intellec-
tuals.
Putting aside the introduction for the
moment, Modern A ustralian Poetry opens
very promisingly indeed. After you have
read lan Mudie’s “Underground” about
the Land —not a very good poem techni-
cally, but an effective opening-piece:
Deep flows the flood,
deep under the land.
Dark is it, and blood
and eucalypt color and scent it —
and after Slessor on Captain Cook and
Rex Ingamells on the convicts it becomes
apparent that there is a design in this
anthology. There is thought behind it
as well as good taste in it. Step by step
we are being introduced to Australia, the
immeasurably ancient land that was so
new to the first arrivals, the strange
country that, through the years of our
history, has become so familiar to us all.
Christopher Brennan comes in with “Fire
in the Heavens,” and one guesses that,
besides paving the way for poems about
the landscape and the development of
the land, the anthologist has cleverly
selected the poem to speak of the heat,
the bushfires and the thunderstorms that
astounded the early colonists.
The poems of the landscape follow:
“Bullocky,” David Campbell’s “Stock-
man,” E. G. Moll, “E,” James Devaney,
Slessor’s “Country Towns.” And after
these visions, these glimpses of our his-
tory and these songs, A. D. Hope comes
in, and, in the way of satirists, declares
that Australia has “no gods, no songs, no
history.” And so Mr. Green is into his
metaphysical section, the giant gloom of
Brennan, the vigor of “Essay on
Memory”: Australia is established as a
civilised country, asking questions about
itself. James McAuley’s blue horses
scream, Slessor beats his fists on the pane
of death, Mary Gilmore turns to the grass
and puts away fears.
There is an interlude for the lyric, and
for love; Shaw Neilson at his orange-
tree, McCrae under his lemon ; an in-
tense sonnet by “J.R.,” a charming
“Grotesque” by Lesbia Harford;
My
Man
Says
I weigh about four ounces,
Says I must have hollow legs.
And then say I,
“Yes,
I’ve hollow legs and a hollow soul and body.
There is nothing left of me.
You’ve burnt me dry.”
There are some songs here by Ronald
McCuaig, the clear and precise melodies
that read best in his two privately-
printed books Vaudeville and The Wanton
Goldfish, lately reprinted in one volume
by Angus and Robertson, under the title
Quod Ronald McCuaig. And, still
among the love poems, T. Inglis Moore,
R. G. Howarth, Frederick T, Macartney,
Brian Yrepont, all attractively repre-
sented ; and then, coming to the full music
of love, Kenneth Mackenzie’s “The
Moonlit Doorway.”
Whereupon, like the villain in a melo-
drama, cloaked, daggered and twirling his
black moustache, Mr. Hope comes im-
pressively scowling in again and says that
love is hell —“The Damnation of Byron.”
Mr. Green turns sadly away in Brennan's
“white wind numbing the world to ai
mask of suffering hate,” faces the harsh
(though happy enough) reality of Wil-
mot’s “Victoria Markets”—the tumultu-
ous life of a modem Australian city—
and concludes with a barrage of war
poems, Leon Gellert and Shawn O’Leary.
So, taking the anthology as a whole, it
might be summed up as a picture of
continent, remarkably clear and compre-
hensive. It has been planned as such;
a poetic map of Australia.
Does the anthology, being in this way
deliberately limited in scope, call for
further examination? It could perhaps
be accepted as it stands; not claiming
to put forward the best Australian poems,
not even the best or most characteristic
poems of the writers included ; simply
a picture of Australia, all omissions and
inclusions justified by the limiting of the
range.
The difficulty of accepting Modern
A ustralian Poetry in this way is that a
picture of a continent can hardly be re-
garded as limited. Mr. Green’s standing
as a critic, the academic authority of his
publishers, the attempt in the foreword to
assess the whole movement of Australian
poetry, the very title of the book—all
these things make it inevitable that the
book shall be regarded as yet another
attempt to make a definitive national an-
thology. Mr. Green says, indeed, that
“the idea has been to afford a general im-
pression of the uppermost layer of Aus-
tralian poetry.”
From this standpoint a few omissions
are to be noted (some justified by the
fact that “the typescript was handed in as
long ago as February, 1945”- w though
corrections and additions could surely
have been made at least to the foreword).
Eve Langley and Norma Davis, and, in-
deed, H. M. Green, could well have been
added to the landscape poets; Charles
Campbell’s “She Combed Her Hair” to
the love poems; Maurice Biggs and Eric
Irvin to the war poets; and, among
recent arrivals, one would have liked
to have seen some notice taken of F.
John Blight, Val Vallis and Francis
Webb. The making of a definitive an-
thology of contemporary writing is in-
deed a hopeless task; ’you take a fixed
point in time, but poetry moves on; you
prophesy, after paying due respect to
Slessor and Fitz Gerald, “McAuley, Hope,
H. F. Stewart, Kenneth Mackenzie and
several other less known poets might
conceivably any day produce something
quite out of the common”—and so they
might, but the Australian poetry out of
the common since February, 1945, has
been produced by Judith Wright and
Francis Webb.
As to the poetry included, if it is to be
regarded as the result of an exhaustive
survey of the “uppermost layer” of Aus-
tralian verse from McCrae and Brennan
onwards, one must note that there was
apparently an extraordinary florescence in
1943, the year in which Mr. Green edited
one of Angus and Robertson’s Australian
Poetry series. For of the 29 poems Mr.
Green chose for that selection of one
year’s verse, ,19 are reprinted in Modern
Australian Poetry. Mr. Green’s con-
firmation of his own judgment is natural,
but not altogether to be approved, for it
is partly responsible for the inadequate
representation of Judith Wright and
Rosemary Dobson.
Because the anthology aims to give “an
impression of modern Australian poetry
as a whole rather than to illustrate the
work of individual poets,” the verses are
presented without the authors’ names
attached, the reader having to turn to the
index to discover who wrote any par-
ticular poem. It is a method that has
been tried in English anthologies, but one
that is never really satisfactory. In
theory it could be argued that a poem
exists in isolation, so that a lyric by an
obscure writer in an obscure magazine
might be ranked above the songs of the
masters. In practice (and justifiably, for
it is the reward of sustained effort) a
poem is not read in isolation but as part
of the mass of a writer’s work; a lyric
by McCrae is valued more highly—arid,
indeed, often conveys more of the feeling
of poetry —than a lyric by an obscure
writer which may seem just as well
written. You can explain this mystically
by saying that any single poem is charged
with the intensity of a writer’s total pro-
duction ; or you can say, simply, that
words conjure up different associations
when used by different writers.
“Satyr” in a poem by Hugh McCrae
is a strong and active symbol ; the word
is vapid when used by nearly all other
writers. “Cloud” in a Wordsworth poem
conjures up the mountains of the Lake
Country; but “cloud” in Shelley means
vacuity, “the intense inane.” And so,
in H. M. Green’s anthology, “Fire in the
Heavens” is a very slight bit of land-
scape until, in some irritation, you turn
up the index and attach to it the weight
and thunder of the name of Brennan.
To a degree, therefore, all “major”
writers in Modern Australian Poetry are
levelled down to the anonymous mass, all
minor writers scaled up beyond their
deserts: and one and all are somewhat
cavalierly treated in that their individual
pride and effort are cut to fit the antholo-
gist’s pattern. No man ever really wrote
a poem to make part of an anonymous
picture of Australia; but for his own
delight, and because the gods told him to.
Lastly, there is the foreword to con-
sider. Only among the treacherous
ground of very recent writing is there
much to complain of. Mr, Green has
probably an exaggerated opinion of the
merits of A. D. Hope, James McAuley
and H. F. Stewart —-all poets who have
been associated with Sydney University
and who, in a certain academic outlook
and use of language, seem to spring from
the eighteenth century, a period when
English poetry sank to mere mechanical
versifying or, as Matthew Arnold put it,
“a kind of prose.” McAuley, certainly,
has an intellectual brilliance ; and Hope,
the most promising df the three, shows a
bitter, lush, puritanical talent that reminds
one of Aldous Huxley, even of Swift. He
may do very well; but, it would seem, in
satire, rather than the high’way of poetry.
One would not care to rank him, as Mr.
Green does, with Fitz Gerald. The big
movement in Australian poetry began
with “Captain Cook” and “Captain
Dobbin” and continued in “Heemskirck
Shoals” and “Ben Boyd.”
These, then, are the objections to
Modern Australian Poetry regarded as a
definitive national anthology. But the
merits of the book emphatically outweigh
its defects. It is mercifully compact; it
contains not more than two or three really
unworthy poems; it courageously ex-_
eludes shoals of unimportant writing as
well as (on 'unexceptionable critical
grounds) the balladists and the extreme
obscurantists ; it includes practically all
the writers of the “uppermost layer” ; the
foreword—with points of difference noted
—is an illuminating survey of Australian
poetry as a whole ; and, finally, the book
is produced in a dignified format. It is
the best anthology of its kind to date, and
the only one Australians should wish to
see circulating overseas. And, with a few
alterations, it should be printed both in
England and America ; for, not to say
more, than Mr. Green, the best of our
poets are “comparable.”
DOUGLAS STEWART.
Faber's "Fibre."
Fibre, a novel by a Canadian,
Barry Sullivan (Faber), has the Western
Desert, the air, and a desert camp for its
setting, and its theme is the struggle
against defeat by fear.
The airmen spend rather too much time
in private musings. There is much they
could have said, far better, in actual
conversations: still, where the author
intrudes and analyses he does it very
well; and, when it is done through
the philosophical filter of a char-
acter it has the same quality—something
of the same weight—as had Charles Mor-
gan’s Fountain. Less practised than Mor-
gan in the craft of writing, Sullivan is
also less dull: there is always the threat
of violent action—if not a great deal of
actual combat, since the flying is recon-
naissance—and the ordinary perils of
flying.
Here it is interesting to turn to the
summary inside the dust-jacket;
The public is said to be now turning
away from books that have anything at
all to do with the war, just as it did in
1919 and the years that followed. Be-
cause of that first turning away the world
had to endure another and more terrible
war. Is there now another turning away
before yet another war? We believe that
this is too bad to be true.
There is undoubtedly a slackening of
public interest in war books. But this
may be due, in great measure, to the fact
that a vast bulk of books were published
during the war with nothing but topical,
ephemeral interest. And it is true, too,
that the “turning away” of the public in
the between-war years was associated
with a deep interest, in fact a craze, for
books which reflected a defeatist, pacifist
attitude to war.
It remains to be stated, too, that for a
book to be worth preserving as a work of
art —or as an approach to art —it must be
independent of its topical interest; but,
if the characters created are living, the
emotions described universal, there is no
reason why a war book should not sur-
vive.
The question is—does Fibre have these
general literary qualities, apart from its
special character as a war book? In the
main, it does. The characters are real,
drawn from life. They include an
Australian, Kit Inglis, “probably the
strongest man in the Western Desert,”
who is a sort of educated Caspar Ruiz,
destroying himself in the end, as dram-
atically as Conrad’s character, by force
of character as much as by physical
strength.
The desert, Alexandria, the war
itself, are seen whole. It is diffi-
cult to quote, for the effect is a
gradual one, quietly persuasive, but some
of the descriptions of the desert are beau-
tiful and profound. And so, although
more lightly, with the city. And fighting
is seen as once a tragedy, a joy and a
test. Especially as a test.
There are also defects. Humor, al-
though not wholly lacking, is somewhat
naive ; Sullivan falls into a trap, not un-
common in beginners, especially in
writing which is autobiographical in its
immediate inspiration, of quoting jokes
and conversations which have only a
local humorous appeal.
To compensate for this, in a measure,
he has a sense of fun. The pictures of
air-crews amusing themselves in the mess,
drinking, getting drunk, tearing Kerr’s
shirt off ceremoniously and having cock-
fights have a gusto which carries all be-
fore it. Also a realism, a recognition of
the fact that a man on active service can
become hopelessly drunk, perhaps in
sordid surroundings, and still, with the
reins of discipline—in the best sense—
upon him, face his duties in the fresh
air of a morning parade; a minor
mystery of the spirit which is apparent
to all ex-servicemen who have attempted
to carry joyous carousals into the world
of civilian values. It can’t be done.
Even in these relatively minor scenes,
and in the humorous sorties, ill-fated as
they are, nothing is really wasted. It all
has some relation to the theme; every-
thing hangs together ; which is sufficiently
surprising in a first novel and a very
favorable omen for Mr. Sullivan’s future
career as a writer.

Method of treating cedar wood?
The method is the same as for other woods
except that no filler, stain or varnish should
be applied directly to the wood without first
giving it successive coatings of pure bleached
shellac, either with a brush or in the manner
of French polishing. To enhance the color
of the wood and to blend closer together the
sharply contrasting red-and-white streaks that
are characteristic of the wood, use a special
wiping stain made of venetian-red and oil
reduced to a thin consistency with naptha or
benzine, and applied with a rag. After the
application of the shellac a wax or varnish
finish may be applied if desired.

Brief particulars of Jimmy Governor’s career
and date of execution ?
While employed on Brelong station, N.S.W.,
Jimmy Governor, in company with his brother
Joe and two other blacks, attacked and killed
his employer’s wife, Mrs. Mawbey, her three
children, Grace, Percy and Hilda, and a
schoolteacher, Miss Kerz, who was boarding
at the station. Tire Brothers disappeared into
the mountains, the next heard of them being
the news of the murder of an old couple named
McKay, followed by those of Mrs. O’Brien and
child and of an old man named Fitzpatrick.
Governor was declared an outlaw, and he and
his brother were run to earth, Joe being shot
dead and Jimmy captured. The latter was
executed on Friday, June 18, 1901.

Correct way of making damper in a camp-
fire ? ‘
You must have a clean, hot fire and be ready
to use it just after all the wood has burnt
to a smokeless red stage. The damper in its
simplest form is self-raising flour, with one tea-
spoon salt to every pound of flour, mixed to a
rather stiff dough with warm water. To make
it more palatable, add a piece of butter or
dripping, melted, to the water. Toss it up in
the hands with flour to avoid sticking, and
form into a round loaf; scrape a hole in the
centre of the fire, drop in. the loaf, and pile it
over with hot ashes and glowing charcoal. It
should rise and cook nicely in about half an

0) Easiest and most satisfactory method of
striking flower cuttings? (2) Suitable plants?
(1) Make boxes 2ft. long by 12in. wide and
6in. deep, put in stones or crocks for drainage
and add soil to within 2in. of the top. Set
cuttings and cover with glass. Earthernware
pots are also suitable; placed in new manure
to generate heat they soon force cuttings to
root. Soil should be baked or saturated with
boiling water before being used to kill weeds.
(2) Carnation, fuchsia, heliotrope, salvia, snap-
dragon, petunia and penstemon; also coleus
and leaf-plarits for greenhouses.
Brief Answers.
R.G.G.; It is unlikely that he published
Ebook of that nature 0.8. E.: (1) Oleander
cuttings are quite easily grown by striking
them in a soil containing a high proportion
of sand. They can also be struck by placing
them in a jar of water, but the former is
preferable. (2) Write Mr. C. T. White, Gov-
ernment Botanist, Brisbane J.A.: The City
Mutual declared a bonus for 1945 which showed
an increase on the bonus declared for 1944.
If your bonus certificate has been lost another
can be obtained from the office at. 307 Queen-
street, Brisbane K.E.: (1) Old theory of
stuttering due to tickling infant’s feet long
since exploded. Within reason there is no
harmful offset to the temporary nervous excite-
ment. (2) Standard weights are 121 b. and
241 b. Fixed prices per block are 6+d. and
Is. Id., any underweight being charged half-
price. Allowance for melting is made in
manufacture.. .-.P.A.: Visual defect due to
tired nerves —not the eyes as applied to sight
itself. Co-ordinal adjustment between optic
nerves and brain cells at fault, so rest is
essential. Your doctor may prescribe
G.McD.: (1) Bronchitis is inflammation of the
bronchial tubes —relief possible when not defi-
nitely inherited. (2) Recurrence depends upon
climatic conditions, especially in the suscep-
tible subject. In “Medical Guide,” Dr. Muskett
advises climatic change during cold months to
North Queensland, as chills and varied tem-
peratures must be avoided. Most cases suited
by dry, temperate location. (3) For specialists
communicate Medical Supt., Brisbane General
Hospital. (4) Cause is infection by micro-
organisms of catarrh in respiratory mucous
membranes of nose and throat. Bronchial con-
gestion spreads according to symptoms and
type of case. Avoid chills, keep throat and
chest area protected, and build resistance with
vitamin A and D foods. (5) Thanks. Handed

Psycho-phantasmal manifestation.
You struck me like an inhalation.
And now by striking they have won the powers
To bring their labor down to forty hours.
And who is there could even feign resistance
Or flee from such a halcyon existence?

The right to strike has blotted out the same.

A maze of conflict and rebel to

Out of the wilderness of truth
Entombed in corporeal walls, a noxious growth
Decaying with the years shades out the light
And all is strife and war.

HUMBERT
IQO hh.p.
r A new and powerful British car, its 6 cylinder engine developing 100 brake horse power, the Humber Super
Snipe, with independent front wheel suspension and tough all steel saloon body, reaches a new peak in lively
and trustworthy performance. At a glance its appearance places it as a car out of the ordinary. But it needs
to be driven for its remarkable acceleration, its reserve of
power, its speed and its comfort, to make the motorist realise
that in the Super Snipe Britain has produced a car of
International standard. It is a car that is named when world*
wide reputations are discussed.
Your State Distributor can give you full particulars and arrange
a demonstration.

Miss Penrith
By E.A.
GOLLSCHEWSKY
MISS PENRITH, tall and spare,
armed with integrity of spirit,
devotion to duty, and a sturdy
black umbrella, arrived’at Coona-
monga on a rainy day.
She was to discover later that most
days were rainy in Coonamonga ; at least
in summer. But Miss Penrith, in 30 years
of faithful service to the Department, had
acquired a superb indifference to weather,
climate, or any other condition of nature.
She was there to educate children. Edu-
cate them she would, and attain, if it
took her last breath, one or two honor-
able passes for Scholarship at the end of
the year.
In Miss Penrith’s bony frame burned
the flame of another consuming passion
besides that of drumming facts of learn-
ing into resisting brains —it was love for
England.
Despite the fact that she had remained
there for only 10 years after her birth,
there beat no more loyal heart in all the
United Kingdom. It, too, would remain
“For ever England.” And all other be-
ings—those unfortunate enough to be
denied birth on the soil of the British
Isles—would remain either colonials or
foreigners. She was kind about this, but
definite.
COONAMONGA was a sugar-growing
centre. There was a sprawling, iron-
roofed, hideous monstrosity of a mill at
the northern end of the main street.
To its hungry mouth, all through the
day and night, its tentacle feelers brought
long, opulent caterpillars, which shrieked
insanely and breathed forth clouds of
smoke, scattering sparks and cinders to
left and right as they raced towards the
mill.
At night the mill was a blaze of lights,
teeming with dark, ant-like figures; it
champed and snorted through the Coona-
monga night and screamed the change
shift with a voice that carried for miles.
The atmosphere was hot and sultry.
Miss Penrith could feel the perspiration
trickling down between her skin and the
corsets she wore more from principle than
from need for restraint.
The colors of the place were dazzling,
too bright till the eyes became accus-
tomed to them. Flowers, flaunting reds
and orange, a brassy sun and a vivid
blue sky in fine weather and many gay
colors in the shirts of the men and in the
women’s dresses.
Italians love color ; and the popula-
tion was nearly all Italian, most of them
born in Coonamonga, and speaking a
delightful mixture of Italian and Aus-
tralian ; clinging to the old ways of their
parents, but inevitably surrendering to
the process of nationalisation.
Miss Penrith, undaunted, took a room
in the only hotel. It was owned by Toni
Marconelli, and the food was good. Her
bed was clean and Mrs. Marconelli had
volubly assured her, with much gesturing
and nodding, that there were “No bugs,
no nothing!” to worry about.
Miss Penrith said nothing, but
thoroughly examined the room in private.
It was clean.
Looking from the window, against
which light rain still drifted, feather-
silent, there were never-ending acres of
chocolate-colored soil. Cultivated to a
fine tilth, it was free from weeds; and
spears of green, in varying stages of
growth, were set out in rows by ruler
and compass.
It was a long way from home. Grow-
ing sugar-cane t seemed a slightly bar-
barous way of earning a living ; the smell
of rum from the distillery lent a swash-
buckling, indecent air to the place that
was distinctly objectionable to a very
refined, very English, schoolteacher.
Miss Penrith, permitting herself a
nostalgic moment, thought of the red-
cheeked apples of Devon, the brandies
and wines her father had brought out with
him to Australia, the powder-cool brush
of falling snow in a leafy lane. Then
she wiped the sticky svyeat from her
glistening face, killed, with a sharp smack,
two mosquitoes which had landed on
her bare arm, and straightened her
shoulders.
She was here for a purpose. There
was a job to be done.
MISS PENRITH found that, among
the 40 children attending her small,
wooden, school, there were only two who
were not Italians,
One was a small black piccaninny,
towards whom Miss Penrith main-
tained a steadily courteous front. She
was terrified of betraying the horror and
repugnance she felt every time his skin
touched hers, and for that reason forced
herself to pat his woolly, crisp curls quite
often, and to guide his halting, black
hand with her own, smooth, well-kept
one in the fashioning of letters and
figures.
Then there was Terence O’Leary.
Miss Penrith stared at him disapprov-
ingly on her first morning at school.
Despite her aversion to foreigners she had
been comforted by the fact that at least
these were clean, as well-behaved as any
other children she had taught, and
moderately intelligent looking.
Terence seemed to be none of these
things. He was a thin, ragged, unkempt
little chap, with a pinched, undernourished
face. His woollen pullover was too big ;
from the rolled-up sleeves stuck bony
red wrists, and the big, loose neckline
fell away from his stringy neck to show a
series of taut muscles and deep hollows.
His trousers had been inartistically cut
down from larger ones and just cleared
knobby red knees. His feet were bare,
and the toes spread-eagled, the ankles
grotesquely large.
The other children regarded her with
all the avid, birdlike, wary curiosity she
had come to expect from new pupils.
Only Terence seemed indifferent to her
presence. He stood at the end of his
line in the playground, dejectedly at
attention, one eye swelling rapidly, one
cheek scraped and patterned with blood.
Two boys unfurled the flag from the
back verandah, and the children saluted.
ms Penrith gave them an aggressive
look.
“Attention! ” she called smartly.
“Quick march, left, right, left ...”
The “left” was slightly accented, and
together with a sharp rap on the verandah
rail with a ruler served to establish the
necessary rhythm. Terence trailed his
feet along, his shoulders drooping dis-
piritedly. Without a hat he was red-
headed, freckled and blue-eyed. The
boy immediately behind him, an Italian,
kept stepping on his heels, scraping them
with his patent-leather pumps.
Miss Penrith stifled the rebuke that
rose to her lips. Better for the urchin’s
sake not to establish any idea of favori-
tism on the first morning. Why didn’t he
turn round and stamp on the offending
shoes, anyway? Any other child would
have.
Miss Penrith, with her neatly-permed
hair secure under a net, her crisp white
blouse showing the pink straps of her
underwear through its sheer weave, her
dark skirt immaculate, her long thin legs
sensibly clad in stout shoes and strong
silk stockings, faced the room full of
children arranged into various groups
designating different grades.
“The fourth will begin with arithmetic,”
she said firmly. “The third will study
the English lesson whilst I hear the
second reading...”
j T was a perfect day out of doors. A
' hot sun beat down on to a steamy
earth, and all the world was fresh washed
and sparkled from the heavy week-end
rains. Frogs croaked in flooded gutters ;
gullies ran deep in strong currents ; a
wonderland of adventure and excitement
lay beyond the school doors.
But inside it was hot. The galvanised-
iron roof caught and radiated the heat
from the brassy sun. The windows of
the school faced east and west, and the
breeze was a gentle southerly. The buzz-
ing of a great blowfly sounded like an
aeroplane in the stillness of the room.
Miss Penrith wiped her face fastidi-
ously with a lace-edged handkerchief.
What a climate! And when you thought
of human beiflgs tending roaring cane-
fires, cutting and loading cane, working
like fiends to make big money while the
crushing lasted, it made you wonder what
they were made of. Still, if they could
stand up to it, she certainly could. Never
had Miss Penrith admitted defeat by a
foreigner, or even a colonial. She would
have felt that an indelible stain had been
cast on England’s prestige.
It became hotter towards midday. The
children grew accustomed to her methods,
and wanted to gauge her authority. One
or two of the older tricks were put across
and she was either ignorant of them or
was deliberately ignoring them.
The school smelt of hot iron, old wood,
paper, ink and sweating children. A
frangipani grew just outside the window,
and, with ivory cups still holding crystal
drops of rain in their golden centres,
exuded a heavy, languorous perfume.
Miss Penrith was marking exercises.
There was a short space of cool, restful
darkness, then she woke with a jolt and
hurried on with her work, hoping none
of the gimlet-eyed children had witnessed
her lapse. Which was, for a first morn-
ing, altogether too much to hope for.
The next wave of refreshing darkness
was more prolonged. It advertised itself.
Miss Penrith gave a discreet, apologetic
little snore and her head fell to one side.
In a flash paper pellets were flying
across the room, red ink was being
emptied into blue, pens were whizzing
skywards to stop, quivering, in the
wooden rafters overhead. Caution was
flung to the winds, and the resultant din
would have awakened the dead. It awoke
Miss Penrith.
She sprang to her
feet, fumbling blindly
for support, still half-
dazed, her eyes blink-
ing rapidly against
the sudden glare into
which she had cata-
pulted from dark,
cool valleys of blissful
unconsciousness. The
instant’s bewilderment
with which she
struggled was long
enough for the school-
room to present an
orderly front.
When Miss Penrith
recovered her wits,
the children were all
sitting facing her.
arms tightly folded behind their backs,
faces guileless and trusting, and not a one
to be pounced on for exemplary punish-
ment.
Miss Penrith, wordless, frustrated,
tortured by self-condemnation for the
weakness that had betrayed her, searched
each innocent face in turn with eyes that
threatened to bore confession from guilty
consciences.
“Terfence O’Leary! What is that you
have in your hands? Give it to me at
once. > This instant.”
It had been thrust into his grimy paw
in the last instant of pandemonium. Slow
thinking had made him retain it. He
got up now, indifferently, and took her the
sheet of paper.
“AH, writing notes, I see.” Her brief
smile showed faultless dentures,
tinted to a rosy, lifelike pink where arti-
ficial gum met synthetic molars. But the
smile was not reassuring, “Let me see.
Thank you.”
She unfolded it and read. Scarlet
swept up her throat, suffused her face to
the very hair-line, stayed there for a full
minute, then slowly receded.
“Did you write this, Terence O’Leary?”
“No, Miss.” The boy shifted from one
foot to another. The veins of his neck
were ingrained with dirt. At close
quarters his hair was matted, badly in
need of cutting, and a promising hide-
out for lively, active secrets.
“You’re lying!” Miss Penrith, deep in
her just heart, knew that she was being
unfair. In the first place the handwriting
was too good to be Terence’s. In the
second, had he written ft, he would,'
hardly have retained it.
But outraged modesty and utter
humiliation demanded vengeance.
Terence’s blue, black-lashed eyes,
startlingly vivid against his red mop,
opened wide at her in genuine surprise.
But he made no attempt to defend himself.
As if, she thought in a stab of clarity,
he is used to accepting insults.
With a quick movement she crumpled
the paper in her hand and thrust it into
a pocket.
“You may go to your place, O’Leary.”
She said with intimidating politeness.
“I’ll deal with you after school is out.”
She saw the grins, the signs, the secret
messages that flashed from class to class.
The Italians are pastmasters at signalling,
and the fact that a voluble exchange of
opinions and gossip was going on did not
escape her. It seemed she whs doing just
as they had expected, and, unwittingly,
Terence’s defence was set up. An-
tagonism against these liquid-voiced,
innocent-faced interlopers took root in
her heart. Was she going to play right
into their hands by joining forces with

Something clearly has happened when
a solidly American publication like the
“United States News” can run without
apologies an approving article on the
theme that “a close military tie between
the U.S., Britain and Canada is to be
carried forward in the peace-time period
ahead.”
Tugging the Lion’s tail may be as
popular an amusement as ever, but,
though many see him as having a difficult
time of it—badly battered by war and
trying to find a readjusted sound foot-
ing in a world he no longer dominates
—only foes suggest that there isn’t still
plenty of life in him. The unmatched
display of grit in the war is paying divi-
dends in respect. There is still criticism,
but no talk now of decadence. Lion,
British Bulldog, John Bull—under any
of the honored aliases Britain is rated a
friend worth having, and a considerable
force in the world still.
In America renewed interest in this
post-war J.B. divides under two main
heads: how he is reshaping in the world,
and how he and Uncle Sam are shaping
together. Typical of the first, which is
a weighing up of J.B.’s strength—hence
his value as a partner —an “Atlantic
Monthly” assessment sees him (“that
master of political paradox who
takes a Socialist-Labor Government and a
House of Lords in his stride”) now em-
barked upon “three of the greatest,
gambles of his career.” These are that
“he can haul himself up by his own
economic bootstraps by boosting exports
to 175 per cent, of pre-war figures” ; that
“he can reorganise the largest Empire
in the world during a period of global
revolutionary turmoil, and hold that enor-
mous aggregation of lands, peoples and
resources more firmly by loosening its
ties” ; and, thirdly, that “the unity and
power of the great Commonwealth can
be fortified by speeding each Dominion
along the paths of industrial expansion,
and thereby broadening its capacity for
economic independence and, incidentally,
its ability to defend itself.”
J.B. Not So Happy
The exports goal has not yet been
reached, but J.B. “is well on his way,
ahead of his own schedule, and far above
pre-war totals already.” The export aim
of “175 per cent, of pre-war figures”
noted by the “Atlantic Monthly” is
differently interpreted; in the recent
British Government White Paper on
J.B.’s industrial recovery it appears to
mean pre-war figures plus 75 p.c., and J.B,
himself does not take nearly so rosy a
view of what has so far been achieved.
The Government White Paper declared
roundly that “the position of Great
Britain is extremely serious,” and regard-
ing the exports drive went on to say:
In addition to making good the short-
ages of goods at home, we have to pay
our way abroad. As a result of the war
we have had to incur very heavy foreign
debts and we have lost at least half of
our oversea investments and the income
from abroad that these investments used
to bring in. Before the war we used this
income to help to pay for our imports. We
import more than half our food and most
of the raw materials we use in industry.
The only way in which we can pay our
debts and make up for this loss of income
is by increasing our exports. We have to
look to our exports to pay for the imports
we need. At present, although we are ex-
porting more goods than we did in 1938,
we are importing only 70 per cent, of the
amount we imported in that year. Yet we
cannot even pay for this low amount of
imports except by using the loans made
to us by Canada and the United States.
During 1946 there has been a deficit of
about £27,000,000 a month between our
exports and our imports—-or a figure of
£328,000,000 for the year. But the American
and Canadian loans Only give us a short
breathing space, and to pay not merely for
the imports we are now getting, but for all
the imports we shall need, we have to in-
crease our exports still more. To do this
we shall have to export in volume 75 p.c.
more than we did before the war, and so
far we have been able to do little more than
get back to our pre-war level. That is why
we have to press on with the export drive
and send -abroad many goods which we
should like to be able to use at home but
which are less vital than the goods we im-
port in exchange for them.
J.B.’s Drive for Trade
The White Paper added that Britain
must keep its customers and find new
ones. As seen by the “Atlantic Monthly,”
J.B. is showing no lack of energy in that
respect: —
From Great Britain a stream of officials,
engineers and administrators flows across
the world to Asia to reinforce those already
struggling on the spot to rehabilitate
Britain’s prestige and economic position in
areas lately recovered from the Japanese
invader. Singapore and South-east Asia are
the receiving centre for this influx.
Trade missions flit from England in all
directions. A four-year pact negotiated
in midsummer ties the whole exportable
surplus of Canadian wheat, together with
Canada’s diminished bacon and dairy ex-
ports, into the evolving pattern of Empire
and Commonwealth commercial unity.
Another comprehensive agreement covers
exports of Australia’s meats and dairy pro-
ducts. New Zealand is not forgotten.
South Africa’s trade swerves sharply back
again to Empire channels. West African
cocoa becomes a British-controlled
monopoly.
Britain also presses her commercial
power drive beyond the boundaries of
REMARKABLE RESEMBLANCE.
—London “News Chronicle."
Empire and Commonwealth. While one
mission was preparing to leave London for
South America for a general survey of trade
prospects, another emerged triumphantly
from negotiations with the Argentine, bear-
ing an agreement which gives Britain what
amounts to practical monopoly over all
exports in Argentine meats.
A few weeks later Brazil joined the
parade. An air-transport agreement with
Buenos Aires splits business on a fifty-
fifty basis between Britain and Argentina.
Meantime, back along world trade routes
to Africa, South America, the Middle
East and South-east Asia a swelling
volume of British machinery, motor-cars,
electrical equipment, machine tools and
other industrial essentials flows in British
ships.
Holding trade to be, of course, “the
basis of survival for Britain and the
Commonwealth,” the “Atlantic Monthly”
adds that “in the pressure for indus-
trialisation that is rising throughout the
Commonwealth and the Empire, and out-
side both, the present seller’s market opens
opportunities for a people willing to
accept self-discipline in their own long-
term interest, even to the point of meagre
living at home.” That could be ironical,
but it refers to Britain itself, and just
how meagre the standard is was suffi-
ciently shown by Food Minister Strachey’s
recent statement that, while “it would be
possible to maintain the present weekly
meat ration of Is. 4d. a head” for 1947,
this could be done only by increasing the
tinned-beef part of the ration from 2d.
to 4d. and reducing the carcass portion
from Is. 2d. to Is. That is, for this
year everyone in Britain will have to get
along on Is. worth of fresh meat per
week. As well, the bacon ration is be-
ing reduced.
It makes steadying reading in Aus-
tralia—shocking reading in view of Gov-
ernment . callousness towards gift food
for Britain—-but the fact that J.B. is
nevertheless going through with recovery
by export wins merited admiration in
America, and, along with some of the
reported Empire defence moves, makes
J.B. a solidly respected figure.
New Empire Defences
Regarding Empire defence, the
“Atlantic Monthly” notes that “Imperial
air headquarters has been shifted from
Canada fo the wilds of East Africa.”
Also;
A vital sector in the grand design for
Empire defence begins at Gibraltar and
lengthens into the Eastern Mediterranean,
encompassing Greece as a bridgehead below
the Balkans to flank the Dardanelles. Air
bases on the greater zEgean isles, notably
Cyprus, will supplement this bastion. The
plan involves a combination of air and
sea power, developed from the experience
of the war.
Palestine, the southern deserts of Trans-
Jordan, Cyrenaica in North-east, Africa,
and the huge new Imperial air centre below
the Red Sea back of the coast of East
Africa, all spell out a vast strategic plan
which regards air power as the major
weapon of any future global struggle. Here
is a set-up intended to dominate every
strategic point in the Middle East. Ceylon
is being transformed into a centre of air
and sea power which will cover India from
the south as well as the approaches to the
Indian Ocean from the South-east Pacific.
In the commentary here quoted from,
the “Atlantic Monthly” referred to Singa-
pore as having “resumed its pivotal role,”
but it has since made mention of reports
that “United Kingdom authorities are
now developing a defence system on the
assumption that neither India and Burma
nor Malaya (including Singapore) and
Hong Kong could be major British bases
in the future.” That role would be
allotted to “Australia and New Zealand,
which implies a falling back from the
new post-war Asia’s mainland,” with
South Africa as “the biggest overseas
base in the event of any closing of the
Mediterranean.” On this same point of
likely drawing back to sounder positions
for future Empire defence, a “Christian
Science Monitor” article suggests that
“the British well may evacuate those
defence positions which have become a
political liability and a military problem
and may withdraw to new bases which
they can hope to hold not only during
the coming years, but during the coming
decades.”
The “Informal” Alliance
The “Atlantic Monthly” comments on
Canada’s defence plans being closely tied
to those of the United States; on the
incorporation of “many American prac-
tices tested successfully during the war” in
“the drastic overhauling of British Army
training methods” ; and also on Field-
Marshal Montgomery’s advice that Britain
should “learn from America’s rapid
system of officer training.” The “United
States News,” in its remarkably out-
spoken and detailed article on the theme
of “a close military tie between U.S.,
Britain and Canada,” goes a great deal
further. It declares that, though “a
formal military alliance is not contem-
plated,” such a tie is already “being
strengthened by agreements now in the
process of being reached.” If informal
arrangements can go as far and be as
embracing as those the “United States
News” details there would sfeem little
need for anything that could be strictly
called “formal.”
The sort of “informal” tie being forged
is described as “an extension to other
fields” of the pre-war arrangement under
which “the U.S. Navy policed the Pacific
while the British Navy policed the
Atlantic.” In this “peace-time integration
of U.S. and British defences”;
Some weapons are to be standardised.
This means that the U.S., Britain and
Canada will make such things as anti-tank
guns that are interchangeable. The United
States is to go ahead with heavy-tank
development, a field in which British in-
dustry is*not so well equipped. Exchange
of students between British and American
military schools will be increased. Flight-
training observers are to be exchanged.
Atom-bomb secrets are shared. The com-
bined Chiefs of Staff of the U,S. and
Britain are to continue functioning for a
while, .and some working arrangement is
to be provided if this group is later dis-
banded.
U.S.-British Teamwork
Stating that “what is going on now is
a series of agreements concerning bases,
weapons, strategy and war production,”
and mentioning that “these steps, point-
ing to close military collaboration
are being strongly attacked by the Rus-
sian organ ‘Pravda,’ by Communist mem-
bers of the British Parliament and by
Left-wing groups in the U. 5.,” the
“United States News” gives particulars of
what it declares is actually being “carried
forward” under what looks near enough
to a mutual defence scheme:
Joint training plans for Royal Air Force
and U.S. Army Air Forces personnel have
been drafted. At present they involve an
initial exchange of 35 officers each way for
observation of aviation training techniques.
This is to be greatly increased later, and it
may result in standardised schooling and
joint research in such things as supersonic
flight.
A combined Anglo-American air force
is likely to evolve from present collabora-
tion plans in a few years, in the opinion
of some top British officials. In any event,
pooling of all details of aeronautical re-
search and integration of U.S.-British-
Canadian air programmes is being discussed
for the period ahead.
Military missions exchanged between the
U.S., Britain and Canada have reached
record peace-time size. In London, for
example, about 100 U.S. Army officers are
permanently stationed for military liaison
and planning with the British. Moreover,
an exchange of intelligence officers now has
representatives of the British and Canadian
armies working side by side with U.S.
officials in the U.S. War Department’s
Pentagon Building, in the British War
Ministry and in Ottawa.
Weapons are to be standardised, in many
cases, along the U.S. pattern. The British
are reported to be redesigning their stand-
ard Enfield rifle from .303 to .30 calibre,
permitting the use of American-type cart-
ridges of this size. In anti-tank guns,
both the United States and Britain are
concentrating on a 57-millimetre weapon.
Both now use the Swedish-designed Bofors
40-millimetre anti-aircraft weapon. And,
in field artillery, the British now are taking
over the standard United States 105-milli-
metre piece for future production.
This is not to involve all weapons,
as the British use a different type of
“powder,” and therefore their guns must be
designed to differ slightly from American
types. But a few basic kinds of guns and
equipment will be interchangeable, so that
critical supplies can be exchanged in case

of emergency shortages such as those of
the last war.
Conferences being held cover a wide
variety of items to be standardised, ranging
down to the number of threads on standard
gun bolts. The idea is to make as many
parts interchangeable as possible, even
though the general design may remain
different.
U.S. Army-Navy unification is inter-
preted as another move towards reaching
conformity with the British-Canadian
systems, while “military and naval schools
and training techniques will be standard-
ised along general lines, through a system
of exchanging observers to copy the best
features in each of the three countries.”
Such exchanges, the publication states,
are already taking place, Field-Marshal
Montgomery’s visit to the U.S. was “largely
in line with this programme,’,’ and “the
number of British and Canadian officers
attending U.S. staff schools has reached
record peace-time proportions, while
more Americans are attending military
schools in Britain and Canada than ever
before.”
The Combined Chiefs of Staff, the
“United States News” points out, still
meet in their war-time Washington head-
quarters, where the described “over-all
plans for military collaboration” are
worked out. An important item in the
arrangements of the “unofficial alliance”
is the pooling of U.S. and British bases
“for emergency use.” This is seen as
giving American forces in some circum-
stances “the equivalent of advance bases
in Northern Canada, in New Guinea, in
Palestine, in Britain, on Malta,” while
giving British forces “war-time use of the
U.S. Pacific defence triangle, dozens of
other islands, and the Panama Canal.”
With training of all U.S.-British troops
“integrated, and defence plans dovetailed
to an extent unequalled before in peace-
time,” it would work out as an Eagle-
and-Lion team which, backing up
U.N.0., could be the soundest world-
peace device so far produced. No one
would attack such a team and it would
attack nobody.
SNAGS IN MIGRATION.
London “Times” having, in a some-
what caustic leader, stated that the many
intending emigrants waiting in Britain
for transport would be disappointed by
the Canberra Ministers’ conference deci-
sion that “large-scale immigration plans
must be abandoned for some years,” Mr.
Calwell gave out that:
Far from agreeirtg to the abandonment
of large-scale immigration or the cutting
down of Australia’s-targets, the conference
had considered alternative means of pro-
curing more accommodation by sea and
air to bring to Australia at least the 46,000
people whose services were urgently re-
quired to fill positions available to them
in various branches of employment during
1947,
As well as lack of transport, Mr.
Calwell may find other snags in the way
of such immigration. Both the “Times”
and the recent British Government White
Paper on industrial recovery have had
something to say on Britain’s own urgent
manpower requirements. The White
Paper, stating that an increase of some-
thing like another 500,000 workers is
needed for the exports drive, and that
the raising of the school-leaving age to
15 would “mean the loss of 370,000 boys
and girls to industry” next year, added:
In 1948 and the following years the total
working population will drop to about pre-
war level owing to the fall in the birth-
rate that occurred in the 1930’5, and the
further raising of the school-leaving age.
Thus the prospect is that for some years
to come there will be an overall shortage
of labor for the work that has to be done.
The “Times” stated that the Aus-
tralian aim for this year was 35,000 immi-
grants, that “plans were discussed for
bringing in 50,000 children, mainly war
orphans, from Britain and Europe,” and
also that Australia “wanted 1000 skilled
building workers from Britain.” Of all
this total, “only about 6000 persons are
now expected to enter Australia in 1947.”
The “Times” reminded Calwell and Co.
that “other Dominions are also looking
to the Mother Country for young and
skilled immigrants” and recalled the find-
ing of the Overseas Settlement Board in
1938 that “a Mother Country unable to
maintain the stability of her own popu-
lation cannot do much to relieve the con-
sequences of a falling birthrate in the
Dominions.”
The British High Commissioner had to
tell Canberra that, in the interests of
British recovery, immigrants should be
drawn from a fair cross-section of
Britain, and not “principally specialists
from essential industries.” Even if that
criticism of Canberra policy had effect,
there would still not be anything like the
expected flow of immigrants from a
Britain itself seriously short of the man-
power needed for its recovery.
SOUTH AFRICA v. U.N.O.
Though its implications were of vital
importance to a country with a White
Australia policy, Australia squibbed when
U.N.O. came to vote on South Africa’s
mandate proposal. U.N.O.’s vote, largely
of non-white countries, amounted on that
and the Indian issues to a vote of censure
on South Africa and an attempt to inter-
fere in the domestic
affairs of that mem-
ber country. General
Smuts having no-
thing of the squib in
him, this is not be-
ing taken lying
down.
South Africa, Gen-
eral Smuts recently
told Parliament, does
not intend to carry
out the U.N.O. re-
quests, These were
that, in regard to the
South - west Africa
mandate, the Gov-
ernment should ask
U.N.O. for a trustee-
ship, and that it
should seek agree-
ment with India on
the Indian legisla-
tion in South Africa,
this legislation a
form of discrimina-
tion extremely mild
compared to the
White Australia
policy.
South Africa has
been incensed by this
attempt at U.N.O.
interference in its
domestic affairs. The
Capetown corres-
pondent of London
“Times” has reported
that it “has aroused
reaj fears for the
future of the United
Nation s.” The
strongest reaction was
expressed by the
Nationalist leader Dr. Malan, who urged
direct defiance of U.N.O. by incorporat-
ing the mandate forthwith into the Union
and by repealing the favorable measures
of the Indian Act and deporting Indians.
General Smuts, thought to have been
acting with mere correct politeness when
he took the mandate issue to U.N.0., did
not favor going as far as Dr. Malan pro-
posed. He told Parliament that the
South-west Africa people had “expressed
themselves as satisfied with the Union
administration and had asked for the in-
corporation of their territory in the
Union” and “the Union could not flout
their wishes.” The Indian legislation he
described as necessary “to prevent Dur-
ban from becoming another Bombay.”
Against “provocatively flouting the
United Nations,” General Smuts favored
submitting a report to U.N.O, on the
administration of the South-west territory,
but insisted that South Africa would “con-
tinue to administer the territory as under
the mandate.” On the Indian question
he was much less accommodating. He
declared —almost certainly with Australia
in mind —that the-Indian legislation was
“designed to • protect South Africa, and
Natal in particular, from the danger
threatening other countries also,” and
(the real crux of the U.N.O. interference)
that the issue “was purely a domestic con-
cern of South Africa in which other
Governments had no locus stapdi.”
The “Cape Times” reading of the
U.N.O. action was that South Africa was
being made the scapegoat for the “wide-
spread guilt-complex” of a world in
Which the war-time hopes of assured
peace and plenty have not been realised.
Actually, the general South African re-
action, so far from being one of cowering
under U.N.O.’s strength, is rather one of
fears regarding U.N.O.’s displayed weak-
ness. This was oddly reflected in one
passage of the recent Parliamentary
debate, when a suggestion that U.N.O.
might “apply sanctions to South Africa”
drew from General Smuts the dry com-
ment of an old campaigner, “South
Africa has friends.”

“World-Telegram”: “So ends the test of the

been wiped from the map as a sovereign State

Questioning U.N.O. —Not yet general enough
to be called significant, but still possible first
straws in the wind, questions on U.N.O. are
beginning to crop up here and there in U.S.
newspapers. Thus N.Y. “Herald Tribune”
comments that “a long succession of formal
meetings, attended by all the panoply of sec-
retaries and protocol, is almost ideally suited
to freeze diplomatic attitudes and create bore-
dom and friction without end.” James Reston,
in N.Y, “Times,” states that “open disagree-
ments openly perpetuated have been the rule
in Allied circles for* more than a year,” and
that “now there are signs that the major Allies
are beginning to return to a compromise be-
tween the old and the new diplomacy,” with
differences discussed privately before being
brought before U.N.O. George E. Sokolsky,
in N.Y. “Sun,” states the question openly:
“Is it even too dangerous to ask, Why not
quit? Yes, to quit the international conferences
that go on endlessly, that have no conclusions,
that produce no agreements —why continue with
them?....What is the use of continuing the
farce of conference and negotiation and
speeches that lead to nothing?”

German Scientists Help U.S. —How far ahead
the Germans were in many important war
weapons is being shown in America, to Uncle
Sam’s benefit. Information given to American
newspapers by the War Department reveals
that some 270 German scientists transferred
to U.S. have “saved American taxpayers well
over a billion dollars, perhaps several billions,
through their contributions in research and
development, more than $750,000,000 having
been saved on rocket research alone.” The
“Christian Science Monitor” states that
“American research in such fields as rockets
and aero-dynamics has been advanced from
two to 10 years through the help of these
German physical scientists,” the number of
whom the Army hopes -to increase to 1000.
The German experts have, in the very pleased
Army view, “earned the right” to apply for
immigration visas, and may be naturalised.
N.Y. “Herald Tribune” says that every one
of them “wishes to become an American citizen,
and the Army is offering co-operation.” Their
families are joining them from Germany.

Cutting U.S. Peace Costs Commenting on
General Marshall’s appointment as U.S. Sec-
retary of State, London “Times” Washington
correspondent refers to Mr, Byrnes having,
while in Europe, become, “acutely aware” of
the “intimate relations in the harried world
of our time between military strength-in-being
and political influence.” Mr. Byrnes found
U.S. influence abroad considerably weakened
by the sweeping American demobilisation.
General Marshall may find his position similarly
weakened. Stating that “the Republicans will
make good on their promise to reduce income
taxes,” the reduction to range from 10 to 20
per cent., a Scripps-Howard Washington report
predicts that this will require a cut “either in
armed services or amount *of international
obligations.” Mr. Byrnes would probably have
said —though General Marshall tvould not need
telling—-that a better peace would be made
if the cut was postponed till the peacemaking
was finally accomplished and world disarma-
ment arranged.
Comic Opera.
Strikes being regarded as a shoot-
ing matter in Soviet-controlled
Rumania, when the Rumanian milk-
oh (feminine) doesn’t arrive some
other explanation is called for.
That happening one day in Buch-
arest, the “Christian Science Moni-
tor” correspondent there sought out
the reason when the milk delivery
was resumed next day.
, “Early yesterday,” the milkmaid
said, “one of the heads of the Com-
munist party in our village came
and told us we were going on a
truck ride. So we all climbed
aboard and when the truck was
filled with peasants, this man told
us we were all to shout ‘Down with
Franco.’ We all rode around the
village for about two hours shout-
ing ‘Down with Franco’ and then
they let us climb down and they
gave each of us a slip of paper
which allowed us to buy a new pair
of boots for half-price.”
Asked if she knew who this
Franco was the milk-oh said, “No,
I never heard of him before, but I
hope we can shout ‘Down with
Franco’ every week so we can get
clothes at half-price.”

WHAT A G.-G!
In the Canberra announcement of “the
appointment of the Hon. W. J. McKell
as Governor-General of the Common-
wealth” and Commander-in-Chief, it was
expressly stated that “Mr. McKell will
be termed Governor-General designate”
until the swearing-in. Incorporated in
the announcement were the Prime Minis-
ter’s congratulations, to which the P.M.
added “I feel completely confident” that
his nominee “will discharge the duties of
his high office with ability and dignity.”
No mention of impartiality, but Mr.
Menzies, as if forewarned of the omission,
did not overlook it in his comment, issued
to the newspapers in intelligent antici-
pation of “the most deplorable incident
in the Government’s growing record of
political jobbery”:-
The, Governor-General has high political
responsibilities, the discharge of which de-
mands complete impartiality and complete
detachment from party politics. These
elements are not to be looked for in a
man who, at the very moment of his
appointment, is most actively engaged in
party controversy in the very country whose
Governor-General he becomes.
Never has a protest against jobbery been
so swiftly and fully justified by the course
of events.
Mr. McKell must have known for
months that he had the succession to the
Duke of Gloucester in the bag. Beyond
doubt, he knew on the night of January
31 that he had been formally named
“Governor-General designate.” Yet on
the afternoon of February 5 the Gover-
nor-General designate had the face to
attend a meeting of the N.S.W. Labor
party and take part in the election of the
new leader and Premier and in the choice
of a Minister to fill the vacancy caused
by his becoming Governor-General desig-
nate. Mr. Treatt, the Opposition-leader,
who had been strangely silent on lawless
industrial outrages, connived at by the
McKell “Government,” of which house-
wives and aged and ailing people were
the principal victims, was not found want-
ing on this occasion. He said that “by
the astonishing act of associating himself
with a political faction fight,” the Gov-
ernor-General designate had “set an all-
time low in political indiscretion and dis-
played a total absence of impartiality.”
What made the thing worse, if any-
thing could have made it worse, was that
the Governor-General designate backed
the wrong horse. In the contest for the
leadership he threw his vote and influence
to the Heffron faction and the Heffron
faction was beaten by the McGirr faction
—beaten by two votes ; 29-27. Caucus is
no shining exemplar of the airs and graces
of putyjic life, but some of its members
were annoyed, if not scandalised, at the
interposition of the Governor-General
designate in the proceedings. One of
them told him before the meeting that it
would not be “quite right” for him as
“chosen” representative of the King to
vote in a party-room on a partisan issue.
Others made similar representations, but
he chose to ignore all the remonstrances
and all the decencies.
In the result he found that most of
his Ministers were against him, and that
his influence with the rank and file had
slumped to zero. Added to his humilia-
tion was the knowledge that the McGirr
victory over Mr. Heffron and the Gover-
nor-General designate would be of
special delight to Mr. Lang, to whom Mr.
McGirr remained faithful when Mr.
Heffron opposed him and until Mr. Mc-
Kell deposed him.
Of course the Big Fellow would learn
all the details from friends in the Caucus
(as he does from friends in the Caucus
at Canberra) sooner than anyone else not
actually present, and would publish them
in his “Century.” But the “Century”
has naturally only a small circulation com-
pared with those of the daily papers ;
and wouldn’t those journals be as indul-
gent to Governor-General designate
McKell in his misfortune as they were to
McKell the Premier? Wouldn’t the morn-
ing papers be as kind as they were during
the 1944 election campaign, when “S. M.
Herald” blithered that Mr. McKell had
“best served the State and the nation by
going along quietly” (all racketeers,
blackmarketeers, s.p. and rent harpies
agreed) and the “Daily Telegraph,” to
which Mr. McKell contributed a weekly
article, certified that as Premier he had
“made no bad breaks”?
Kind they were not. The “Herald”
came out with a full and precise account
of the party meeting, coldly revealing also
that it had been “suggested to reporters,
on Mr. McKell’s behalf, that ‘unnecessary
publicity should not be given to the fact
that he had taken part in the ballots.’ ”
The other paper declared that, “after
congratulating Mr. McGirr, Mr. McKell
strode out of the room, his face set and
white with anger.” And that in a column
which Mr. McKell had recently filled for
one consecutive day while the “column-
ist” was on leave.
Further humiliation was in store for
the Governor-General designate. During
his first three years as Premier it became
notorious that Dr. Evatt’s brother Clive,
who had entered the House at a 1939 by-
election as a disciple of Mr, Heffron, and
had secured office in 1941 by Caucus
vote, had fallen under his chief’s dis-
pleasure. After the 1944 election Mr,
McKell tried to have Mr. Evatt voted out
of the Ministry by leaving him off “the
ticket,” and, although the shabby
manoeuvre failed, he got even with his
aversion and the latter’s supporters in
Caucus by depriving Mr. Evatt of
Cabinet rank, reducing him from Minister
of Education to Assistant Minister. Find-
ing in process of time that this would
not do, Caucus reactions having been
nasty, he brought Mr. Evatt back into
the Cabinet as Minister in Charge of
Tourist Activities and Immigration a
Minister without a department, and so
with an empty title—and No. 13. This
was a personal victory for Mr. Evatt, but
it merely allayed his wrath, and he bided
his time.
His time came when the Governor-
General designate arrived in the party-
room to secure the Premiership for Mr.
Heffron. Throwing that gentleman over-
board, and rejecting appeals from Can-
berra, Mr. Evatt was active in his support
for Mr. McGirr, and his vote and influ-
ence, not Mr. McKell’s, prevailed.
The new Premier straightway gave the
young man his reward, in the process
rubbing salt into the wounds of the
Governor-General designate and Mr.
Heffron. Pronouncing the McKell reject
“a man of outstanding ability and
energy,” well qualified to grapple with
“the most important problem in Aus-
tralia,” Mr. McGirr transferred Mr. Evatt
to his own department of Housing, with
third place in the Ministry, above Mr.
Heffron, who had been third throughout
the McKell period. Mr. Baddeley re-
mains Deputy Premier and thus No. 2.
He is the Forde of N.S.W. State “Labor”
Administrations ; as someone said of Mr.
Forde, “always a bridesmaid, never a
bride.”
All these proceedings must be dread-
fully embarrassing to the Chifley “Gov-
ernment.” The Prime Minister, the
Deputy Prime Minister, his rival for that
position and the leader of the Senate are
all from N, S. Wales, and none of them
is without poignant memories of previous
party splits—l9l7 (the conscription issue),
1922 (Dooley-McGirr), 1927 (Lang-
Loughlin), 1931-32 (Beasley-Scullin),
1938 (Lang-Heffron)—and their dire con-
sequences, which will be repeated at the
forthcoming State election, with certain
repercussions in the Federal Labor party,
if the McGirr-Heffron shindy develops
into the familiar hullabaloo. But
the immediate causes for perturbation are
the appearance of the Governor-General
designate in the role of rank partisan,
and beaten partisan at that, and Mr.
Evatt’s contribution to his discomfiture.
No doubt the Governor-General desig-
nate apprised Mr. Chifley of his inten-
tions before hurling himself into the
faction fight. No doubt Mr. Chifley
waited complacently fojr the news that
the Governor-General designate, his pres-
tige enhanced by his appointment as the
King’s “chosen” representative, had
brought off the election of Mr. Heffron.
Staggering must have been the shock to
Mr. Chifley and all his Ministers, the
Deputy P.M. perhaps excepted, when it
was borne in on their minds that Mr.
Heffron had been defeated, and that his
downfall had been encompassed, in
large part, by Dr. Evatt’s brother.
Cabinet discussion of the outcome was
doubtless mournful on one side of the
table, perhaps acrimonious on the other,
but Cabinet discussions are never re-
ported.
It is improbable that the King’s
“chosen” representative will be allowed to
take part in the N.S.W. election cam-
paign, even if his thoughts run that way.
There is still time for him to spring to
the defence of the Sydney Turf Club, his
chief contribution to the war against the
Japanese, which has, very tardily, been
caught in the act of carrying out a huge
building programme on one of its race-
courses when thousands of servicemen,
for want of materials and labor, are still
homeless. Pending the arrival of the
King’s commission, the Governor-
General designate may even choose to
take the stump for Bung and the Brewer,
who are making heavy weather of their
agitation for 10-o’clock closing. In view
of his accepted friendship for the Trade,
this would be a logical, if insolent,
sequel to the part he played when, as
Governor-General designate, he tried to
thrust on N. S. Wales a Premier of his
own kidney in the detestable spirit
shown by Mr. Chifley in thrusting him
on the King.
In due course his Majesty will be in-
formed of the antics of the Governor-
General designate, if he hasn’t been in-
formed of them already. A “chosen”
representative like this Mr. McKell the
Crown never had before, and it is to
be hoped will never have again.
"World Leaders."
The champion turnip for the emptiest
platitude of the year will surely be
awarded to Mr. Makin for his heady state-
ment that '‘Australia’s world leadership”
is now taken “more or less” for granted.
The “Government” of which Mr. Makin
was a member “leads” only in the sense
in which the Duke of Plaza Toro led his
regiment, and from the same position.
It is the world’s worst example of settled
and drivelling capitulation to industrial
gangs and gangsters. In the case of the
Brisbane “squatters” it is letting Com-
munists take possession—violently in the
latest instance—of national property.
True, Dr. Evatt has been showing his
technique of “leadership” at a confer-
ence, convened by himself, which locked
out the schoolboys of the Canberra High
School because the use of the empty
House and Senate Chambers was refused,
it being “a matter for the Speaker and
the President,” Mr. Chifley whined.
True, also, one of Dr. Evatt’s young men
has been lambasting Russia and the
United States on the score of their attitudes
before U.N.O. without, so far as is
known, making either of those great
Powers weep in contrition. Dr. Evatt,
the Foreign Minister, leading a pack
of greaser diplomats is a very dif-
ferent kettle of fish from Dr. Evatt, the
Attorney-General. In the former office
he is always boiling over; but as cus-
todian of the Commonwealth’s legal
machinery his temperature never rises,
even when industrial laws and regula-
tions, as well as the rights and interests
of the nation, become the sport of Com-
munists and fellow-travellers.
Dr. Evatt boiled steadily during the
Canberra South Seas Conference, warmed
by consciousness of the alleged sufferings
of the Melanesians and the Polynesians,
whose principal problem at present is
to avoid falling over the teeming civil
servants and investigators ushering in
their New Order. There was no
obvious reaction by him to the brazen
industrial lawlessness which has swept
the country.
The Chifleys have been playing with
the dangerous industrial situation for
months till they appear more like soldiers
running the gauntlet than a Government.
They have begun to hold Cabinet
meetings to consider a change in the
industrial machinery and a reorganisa-
tion of the Industrial Arbitration Act,
under conditions unbelievable in any
country but “Labor” Australia. In
Britain the business would have been dis-
cussed months ago. It would have been
reviewed by a Parliamentary committee
representative of both Houses, till it
emerged as did the British Government’s
Agriculture Bill, which went to the House
of Commons last week “product
of the combined wisdom of all sections
of the industry and of the views of the
three major parties.”
But before the initial Cabinet meeting
on February 5 Mr. Chifley had to admit
that he had no plans and that there was
no measure of agreement between Minis-
ters on any principle save that the number
of the Conciliation Commissioners should
be increased. Neither was there any
measure of agreement between the two
industrial organisations from which the
“world leaders” take orders. The
A.W.U. was in favor of decentralisation,
with Judges in each State to admit of
disputes being dealt with quickly; the
A.C.T.U. was in favor of centralisation
—centralisation being the secret of its
overweening power.
The industrial position as it revealed
itself during the past week was graver
than it had ever been, since it provided
further clinching evidence that the leaders
of the general lawlessness are not con-
cerned with demands so much as with
disruption. If any proof had been
needed that the kind of disturbance to
which industry has been subject gains
nothing for those who take part in it,
it was served up on the doorstep in
Sydney in the Bunnerong and dockyard
disputes.
The farmer came to its culmination
after 18 months, during which the needs
and comfort of no section of the com-
munity had been considered. House-
wives had suffered untold hardships. In-
nocent workers in other industries had
been thrown out of jobs. Old people
and hospital patients had died. The
effects on the community and the enter-
prise concerned—a public enterprise —had
been so far-reaching and cumulative that
in the compass of a month there were
four electricity blackouts in Sydney, one
lasting over an hour and one directly
affecting nearly 500,000 people. Yet at the
end the men accepted conditions against
which they had “fought” and agreed to
shift work, loss of which in the last 18
months has seriously impaired the effici-
ency of the plant.
In the dockyard dispute, Mort’s Dock
became the scene of a Communist-
sponsored attempt to pick off Sydney
shipyards one by one in pursuance of
a lawless campaign to extort another
£1 a week, the forty-hour week and
other concessions without recourse to
the Arbitration Court. But when the
“fight” began by the withdrawal of 28
cranedrivers from Mort’s, the agitators
met unexpected opposition.
employers shut their yards and shops;
in effect locking out 7000 employees
until they agreed generally to abide by
the law. After paralysing the industrial
shipbuilding front for over two months,
throughout which period the “world
leaders” merely looked on, nearly all the
unions gave way and agreed to submit
their case to the Arbitration Court.
If these two examples are not a
pointer to the failure of strike policy
they should be. But from the Com-
munist point of view they have proved
a success, since they have caused wide-
spread discontent and further accentuated
the “class war” which is the steppe-
stone to insurrection. They have indeed
been Considered an incentive to further
examples of union arrogance.
Thus the Waterside Workers’ Federa-
tion, led by the Communist Healy (imp.),
by way of extorting annual holidays—
two weeks at £8 17s. lOd. a week —together
with “appearance money,” went on strike
against work after 5 p.m.
The Communists hoped that this
would compel the Stevedoring Commis-
sion to suspend all who refused night-
shifts, thus tying up all on the
wharves. At the same time they counted
rightly on the soft Canberra crowd giv-
ing in, as usual, to their demands.
Senator Ashley, by-passing the Concilia-
tion Commissioner, called a conference,
at which the employers accepted the basic
principle of holiday pay and offered
arbitration. To this the watersiders’
bosses replied that they would agree only
to arbitration, not by the Court but by
the new Stevedoring Commission which
the “Government” proposes to appoint,
knowing that such a commission will be
a feeble shadow of authority, subject to
union caprices and threats.
The ban on overtime came into imme-
diate operation. On the first day 23
ships in Sydney were short of night labor,
and some lacked day labor. One, bound
for Newcastle to take coal to Tas-
mania, could jiot get men to unload 10
tons of spelter in daylight. Another ship,
which had 10,000 bags of potatoes for
Newcastle, was refused permission to
unload them in Sydney, where potatoes
are unobtainable. In Newcastle more
than 100,000 tons of shipping already
was idle. Coal deliveries to non-
producing States had virtually ceased.
Wheat deliveries to N. S. Wales from
other States were reduced to nothing.
Before the night-work strike developed 15
Sydney flourmills had been working two
shifts instead of three. On February 5
it was announced that in a few days
there would be nothing to grist. So a
bread shortage threatens, and the sugar
shortage is such that it could soon develop
into a famine.
Meantime the A.C.T.U. was heard from
—to the effect that the Commonwealth
Arbitration Court must hear the 40-
hour-week and basic-wage claims sepa-
rately ; that the 404iour week must be
granted by May 1; that the war and
“prosperity” loadings must be incor-
porated in weekly pay, plus a pound on
the basic wage, and that everything must
be handed to the A.C.T.U. on a platter,
otherwise there will be a general May
Day strike.
And all this at a time when the British
people are without lighting and fuel and
millions without jobs, when a great part
of the world is on the verge of starvation
and when Australia itself is still in the
grip of one of the worst droughts it has
ever known.
And what are the “world leaders” do-
ing about it all? Well, they are believed
to have a plan for raising the Parliamen-
tary salary from £lOOO to £l5OO.


PLAIN ENGLISH
"Vigor and Courage."
Sydney “Morning Herald,” performing
evolutions in the midst of the McKell
appointment, suddenly found itself con-
fronted with a new Sydney Premier, one
of the McGirrs, James of that ilk, and
nearly dislocated a printing machine try-
ing a find something with which to praise
him. Noting that there “is plenty for
the McGirr Government to do” —it had
praised his predecessor for “going along
quietly” in war-time—it reminded every-
body, including the thousands of homeless
ex-servicemen, that this paragon of a
McGirr was McKell’s Housing Minister,
and said:
He had the most thankless portfolio in
the Cabinet,.. .It is not necessary to agree
with all the Housing Commission has done,
particularly in the ruthless and lavish
acquisition of building sites, in order to
admit that under Mr. McGirr the problem
has been tackled with vigor and courage.
“With vigor and courage.” Govern-
ment housing in N.S.W. has been a tragic
fiasco, and during the Budget debate in
the closing days of the last Parliament
was roundly condemned by the Opposi-
tion-leader in terms that called for a
reply:
Nobody has been able to get from Mr.
McGirr the cost of Housing Commission
houses The Auditor-General’s figures
show the administrative cost of every build-
ing of any kind to be £117... .Actual ex-
penditure in 1945-46 exceeded the estimate
by £37,748... .The staff has grown in three
years from 46 earning £6089 to 658 earning
£217,159 It cost the taxpayers £245,885
for 2108 “various structures” The Gov-
ernment is “terrified” to . divulge actual
home-building costs, which have even Mr.
Chifley “seriously disturbed.”
All that the man of “vigor and cour-
age” could find in response was abuse of
the Opposition and private homebuilders,
with the damning admission that of 4111
“units” *built by his Commission since the
war, 1200 were converted army huts.
Then fell a short silence, after which a
Mr. HarrtUton Knight, Minister of Labor,
was put up in “S. M. Herald” to announce
a “State Development Council” and to
make a piteous appeal for co-operation
from everybody so that the Housing
Commission could achieve its “target.”
Mr. McGirr was still Housing Minister
when it came out that enough material
for 20 houses was being used by the
Sydney Turf Club for new buildings at
it* Rosehill racecourse, in addition to
concrete for a tower. The fact that
Communists blew the gaff is beside the
point. Had there been real “vigor and
courage” in the Housing Ministry, the
Sydney Turf Club would not have been
granted special building privileges, nor
would Communists have been able to
exploit the misery of the homeless.
Housing in Victoria.
Just when houseless Victorians had
come to the conclusion that the Cain
Government’s grandiose scheme for
spraying the State with pre-fabricated
houses was a fabrication, Mr. Cain an-
nounced not one, but possibly two
schemes. Each provides —on paper —for
the erection of 1000 houses p.a., one lot to
be supplied by the Beaufort Division and
the other over the counter of the Myer
Emporium.
The Beaufort project was floated on
a tide of oratory on a wet July day in the
Treasury Gardens by Mr. Lazzarini (now
forgotten, though he was then Common-
wealth Housing Minister) and Mr, Barry,
and the public was led to believe that the
flood of all-steel houses would be like
the Eildon Weir breaking. After a wait
of some months it leaked out that the
only thing lacking for the all-steel pro-
ject was the metal, though it was not
B.H.P.’s fault. A few months later Mr.
Cain announced an early start on a
£16,000,000 project for 11,500 houses on
the Beaufort pattern, which, if not a gem
of architecture, would at least keep the
rain and wind out. Up to date the only
example vouchsafed has been the experi-
mental example erected in the Treasury
Gardens.
The latest plan is surprisingly modest.
There is some hope in the fact that a
private firm has offered to do the job. If
a contest were arranged between private
enterprise and officialdom as to which
would be over the finishing line first, the
spectacle might solace the public for its
lack of dwellings, especially if a sweep
were arranged on the outcome as an
advance instalment of the Barry lotteries.
Since the Government made itself
supreme controller the building industry
in Melbourne has had to revert to a sys-
tem of barter like that of the natives of
Borneo. Those indigenes leave the pro-
ducts of the jungle in a clearing to be
picked up by the coastal trader. The
coastal trader leaves the equivalent in
goods, and neither sees the other. In
Victoria firm A wants tiles, and lays in a
stock of cane-ite. Firm B rings up and
asks for cane-ite. A says: “Have you
tiles?” “No,” says B, “but C has tiles
and needs nails.” If A can supply the
nails to C he gets his tiles and B gets his
cane-ite. Meanwhile the small builder
with a contract to build ten houses puts
the frame up aiyi then comes to a dead
stop. He is being crowded out of
business.
Loans and Legshows.
The guiding principle in Sydney press
photography seems to be “wait for a
strong wind and get an ant’s-eye view.”
A tennis girl cannot hope to see her
photo, in the paper unless the camera-
man is able to catch her at a moment
when her skirt is up around her neck
and from an angle that makes her legs
look as if they belonged to a heavy-
weight wrestler, while any flapper who
is brazen enough to parade on the beach
dressed in the equivalent of a G-string
and a couple of postage stamps is cer-
tain of pictorial publicity.
The “Daily Mirror,” “Labor’s” favorite
paper and instrument of “Labor” cracks
at Britain, is helped along by Hollywood
publicity stills. It’s a dull day that
passes without “D.M.” readers being
treated to at least one example of smirk-
ing near-nudity masquerading as art and
innocence.
But even “Daily Mirror” readers,
accustomed to their afternoon helping of
flesh and fantasy, must have been mysti-
fied at an advance publicity splash served
up to them last week on behalf of Mr.
Chifley’s forthcoming Commonwealth
Loan campaign, one of the highlights of
which is to be a National Quiz Champion-
ship. The picture purported to show the
Quizmaster hunting up references at the
N.S.W. Public Library.
It depicted a scene in the Research
department. The Quizmaster, attired as
for a drink-waiter act, was striking an
attitude alongside a loaded book-wagon.
Lolling back among the books was a
buxom young girl, her left index finger
stuck into the middle of a book and her
dress pulled up above her knees and
half-way to her hips. “Pulled up” is
used advisedly, as the Research room
at the Public Library is one place in
Sydney where strong winds blow not.
Within those precincts if a skirt is
found wandering up around its wearer’s
waist it’s a safe bet she wants it
there. Whether the damsel in the
picture pulled hers up for comfort or by
request is known only to herself, the
Quizmaster, the man with the camera and
the “Daily Mirror.”
It goes without saying that the girl
LADY'S TIT-FOR-TAT.
“For appearing without a tie, Mr. Calwell was turned away from the dining-room at the
Hotel Canberra.”
“Mister, here’s your tie!”
sprawling among the books was no mem-
ber of the Library staff. The whole thing
was just a cheap stunt in very bad taste
and reflecting offensively on the staff and
conduct pf a fine institution. And it was
done in the name of a Commonwealth
Loan!
Bogeyman Pollard.
There has been in existence for too many
years a body called the Australian Agri-
cultural Council. It consists of Ministers
of Agriculture and departmental advisers,
and periodically it gathers at Canberra
and issues useless statements and passes
equally useless resolutions. It has met
again, with Mr. Pollard, Mr. Scully’s suc-
cessor as Federal Minister of Agricul-
ture and inheritor of his wheat-stabilisa-
tion scheme, as presiding deity.
Mr. Pollard expressed annoyance at
the rejection of the Scully scheme by
S.A. growers. They rejected it because it
provides for farmers getting only part
of the high export price for wheat,
the other part to be transferred to a
fund against a problematical future when
their wheat would fall to less than ss. 2d.
a bushel. The scheme had a strong smell
of “socialisation” about it and, worst of
it all, it took in the 1945-46 harvest.
After Mr. Pollard had spoken his piece
the A.A.C. came in with a doleful pre-
diction of “a heavy slump” in wheat
prices: “Commonwealth Department of
Agriculture officials believe the trend of
world wheat prices in the next 12 to 18
months will force the States to seek the
security of a Commonwealth-wide stabi-
lisation plan.” By what strange system
of forecasting these “officials” attained
that belief isn’t stated, though they did
throw in some figures about European
yields.
It was announced that the present
Wheat Acquisition Act would continue in
force until the end of 1947 under the
Government’s war-time powers (weren’t
they to have ceased at the end of the war
if the 1944 Evatt referendum wasn’t
carried?) apd that, under it, a reserve
fund of about £10,000,000 had already
been created. Wheatgrowers in touch
with woolgrowers instantly remembered
a little matter of £7,000,000 accruing
from the war-time wool scheme which
the Government swiped for some pur-
pose vaguely described as wool research
and promotion, and they wondered, and
are still wondering.
Anyhow, with their own knowledge of
the world wheat position and present ex-
port prices (13s. 7£d. per bushel in Lon-
don last week for March delivery),
they aren’t to be intimidated into swal-
lowing any wild “Labor” plan, and Mr.
Pollard and his A.A.C. will have to think
up a better way of establishing confi-
dence.
Stars and Stripes Down.
“Ek Dum”: The United States Army’s
“occupation” of Australia ended for-
mally at midnight on January 31, when
the Brisbane base was closed —five years
and a month after the first Americans
arrived. The last manifestation of the
presence of the Americans had been at the
aerodrome when “taps” was sounded that
day before a little party of former
U.S. servicemen who have stayed behind
as civilians, with the U.S. Consul and
Major-General R. H. Nimmo, G.O.C.
Northern Command, looking on.
Brisbane was more closely associated
with the Americans than any other city. It
was their headquarters during the crucial
stages of the war and their routing port
for the northern battlefronts. While
planning the New Guinea campaigns
General MacArthur had his H.Q. in
the A.M.P. Building, at the intersection.
of Queen and Edward Streets, the very
centre of business life.
There should assuredly be a Common-
wealth memorial to commemorate the
association of the 2,290,757 American
servicemen who passed through the port
with Australia’s defence of her home-
land.
Perhaps Queenslanders, usually warm-
hearted and generous, will themselves
move in the matter, with servicemen’s
organisations as collaborators. A good
idea would be a scholarship or a series
of scholarships or the of
ian exchange professorship i n some'''sub-
ject of mutual interest *tb Australia and
the United States—in tropical
diseases, which Austrians and Ameri-
cans jointly did so rr iuc h to combat, with
results that will endure.
These Films.
Two or three worthy Australian “feature”
films have been made in the last year or
two and, taken with the fact that news-
reel and documentary work is nearly
always good, this gave rise to hopes that
Australia would at last give Hollywood
a run for its money, in the home and
British markets, at least. Unfortunately
the inanity which was the curse of the
business in the past is creeping in again.
Certainly nothing could be so inane
as the “advance publicity” for a film,
not yet “in production,” for which the
projectors have gone to Kipling for a
title. One of the threatened characters
is a pugilist, member of a numerous band
that was spared the annoyance of fighting
the Japs, who is to be engaged, not for
a boxing act, but for a luv part. Pugilists
are all right in their way, but this par-
ticular pugilist has an impassive phiz and
does-not smile easily. Unfortunately he
has been so worked up by preliminary
press and other praise that he talks seri-
ously of giving up the ring to cultivate
his film career. Dear, dear!
Another impending masterpiece or dis-
aster is a film on the overrated and over-
done episode of the Eureka Stockade,
with Mr. “Chips” Rafferty as Peter Lalor.
Mr. Rafferty made a capital fist of the
drover’s part in “The Overlanders,” but
at Peter Lalor he would be grotesque.
This is how Peter Lalor looked when
Phil May drew him for The Bulletin
not long before his death in 1889.
Anyone less like Peter than Mr. Rafferty,
who is very long and very thin, it would
be difficult to imagine.
Eureka has been the subject of a book
by a Mr. Clive Turnbull,
“Herald” young man, and there is a
dreadful impression that the film-makers
will be guided by Mr. Turnbull’s account
of Lalor and by Turnbull heroics, of
which a specimen is subjoined:
Eureka still stands as part of the Aus-
tralian fabric. Among the burning tents
a greater battle was fought and won than
any recorded in the reports of Government
agents—a battle that remains to be fought
again and again by men of goodwill until
the last fight of all is won. More gold
than can be measured in the scales of
usurers was won on Eureka in ’54.
Bunkum, Clive, bunkum; nor did
Lalor go to Ballarat “to escape the fires
of rebellion that were kindling in
Ireland.” Not long after Eureka, when
he had become a steady going politician
and company director, he was attacked
by the Ballarat “Star” on his attitude to
a new Constitution for Victoria. As
James G. Murtagh notes in his Australia :
The Catholic Chapter, he replied by
asking what the “Star” and other critics
meant by the term “Democracy”?
Do\they mean Chartism or Communism
or Republicanism? If so, I never was, I
am not now, nor do I ever intend to be a
Democrat.
Nevertheless, as Mr. Murtagh points out,
“the Communists in Australia have con-
stantly endeavored to make Eureka their
own for propaganda purposes.” They
will do this with the film if it leans their
way or if they think it does. In thai
case, they will give it the “benefit” of all!
their monkey tricks, with assemblies oV
Eureka-Youth yobs and the like. That will
mean an almighty cold-shouldering of
the film by people to whom Communists
are poison. Such a sequel to the generous
reception given to ‘The Overlanders”
would be very unfortunate for the people
concerned and for the Australian film
industry in general.
The company would be well advised to
drop Eureka before Mr. Rafferty has
finished growing his Lalor beard, and
find him a subject more suited to his
physical make-up and his talents*

CARRERAS LTD.-OVER 150 YEARS’ REPUTATION FOR QUALITY
POLITICAL POINTS
One of the worst winters on record
almost froze the British Isles to a stand-
still last week and Tritons got an oppor-
tunity to test “nationalisation” of the
coalmines. It broke down, of course,
and Britain was brought to its “greatest
crisis since the war,” industry being de-
prived of electric power, 4,000,000
workers of jobs and about 30,000,000
people of lights and cookers for 35 hours
in the current week. It took a bunch
of Labor-socialist theorists to do , what
the Germans could never do. Shinwell,
the Leftist Fuel Minister, is the main
culprit. He and fellow-Leftists Strachey
(Food) and Aneurin Bevan (Housing) are
the Government’s champion duds.
There were three Chamberlains, Joseph,
Austen and Neville, and there have been
three McGirrs, Paddy, Gregory and Jim.
Greg came into the picture as M.L.A.
for Yass in 1913 and Paddy in 1947 as
M.L.A. for Macquarie; Jim did not
arrive until 1922, when he became M.L.A.
for Cootamundra. Even then, and for
years afterwards, the notion that Jim
would reach the Premiership would have
seemed as fantastic as that Neville Cham-
berlain would have attained a post denied
to his father and his brother. Yet Jim
has brought it off, and —the Chamberlain
analogy here withering—Paddy and Greg,
were on hand with congratulations.
After four years as M.L.A. for Mac-
quarie, Paddy McGirr crossed to the
Legi Council, and he has been there
since August, 1921. Greg McGirr, after
12 years (1913-25) in the Assembly, dur-
ing which he was Minister for two years
and rival of Dooley for the Premiership,
faded out, after having in the meantime
had brother Jim nominated and, thanks
to Greg’s support, elected for Coota-
mundra in 1922. Greg had stood for
the Senate in 1906 and he was to have
another shot at Federal politics as In-
dependent Labor candidate for Calare
in 1940. Jim stuck to Assembly politics,
apd, though the course of events whirled
him from Cootamundra to Cumberland
and then to Bankstown, his wanderings
bore fruit. A young relative stood for
Darling last year as a Country party man.
At that period there must have been ani
mated discussions in the McGirr family—
but no doubt they have been suspended.
Chifley’s favorite expression is “That’s
a matter for”—the Commonwealth Arbi-
tration Court, the State Arbitration Court,
the State Government, the Stevedoring
Commission or any other concern that
may occur to him in his buck-passing
mood. The formula being unavailable in
the case of defence, “it is not possible at
this stage” has been substituted. The
full issue of empty words is “It is not
possible at this stage to submit for
Cabinet consideration any concrete pro-
posals on matters relating to the post-
war defence of Australia.” Perhaps it is
hoped that “social security” will do the
business somehow.
A day or two before Chifley admitted
that his “Government” was without a
defence policy, Warren Austin, Uncle
Sam’s representative on U.N.0., an-
nounced that the President intended to
retain universal compulsory training as
a ‘basis of security until effective control
of atomic energy wits established. He
added “The United States tried uni-
lateral disarmament, which failed miser-
ably.” It failed miserably here, too, but
that won’t deter “Labor” from trying it
again, especially if “Labor” knows some-
one else has divisions for which “Labor”
can yell. -
Sydney’s morning press has abandoned
its feud with Calvell, the abandonment
oddly coinciding with Calvell’s introduc-
tion of masses of foreign Jews. Another
large consignment—just on a thousand —
is coming from Marseilles, and this kind
of immigration will no doubt be speeded
up when the Aquitania is converted and
commissioned. According to Calvell,
“the Aquitania, in her present condition,
is capable of transporting 2006 people
each trip, but strong representations are
being made for an increase to at least
3000 persons.” Meanwhile a Mr. Masel,
of Melbourne, is reported as having
arrived at Shanghai to round up “settlers”
for Calvell.
A Sydney cemetery became the scene
of the most ghoulish and abominable
manifestation of “militant” unionism
when two gravediggers downed tools in
the middle of filling in the grave of a
policeman, whose funeral had been de-
layed a few minutes. The men had been
ordered by their union to quit at 4.30,
In the result mourners took their coats
off and finished the job, after weeping
women had been escorted away. A paper
which reported the incident quoted the
strikers as saying that they “felt like
heels.” Desperate is the case of “mili-
tant unionists” when men ordinarily
decent feel impelled to behave “like
heels.”
The “Six-Hour Art Union” (i.e., lottery),
which is to raise funds for a new Trades
Hall in Sydney, where at least half a
dozen unions are Big Business, was to
have been drawn on January 13. Then
the date was extended to February 10.
Sales closed only on February 7.
“Labor’s” Lottery Act says a week must
elapse between closure and drawing so
as to assure that all butts are in ; but a
little breach like that is nothing to
“Labor.”
On some subjects minds poles apart
find themselves kin. During the week-
end. Menzies, speaking of the Chifley
Government, referred to its “pig-headed
silence,” and the official organ of the
tram and bus men spoke of Chif’s “pig-
headed obstinacy” on matters of taxa-
tion. Stubbornness at the right time is
a desirable quality, but pig-headed ness
never yet saved a pig—even in Ireland —
from becoming pork.
The Mountjoys ride again! The
Commos are putting up two candidates at
the W.A. elections, one of them a Mount-
joy. No, not the Mountjoy who was
turned down by the electors last Sep-
tember ; he’s still drawing his pay for
doing something or other with or to the
C.S.I.R. The one who is going to do
his deposit for East Perth calls himself
Henry, and is secretary of a group of
market-gardeners, largely foreign-born.
v It came over the air at the beginning
of the week that Governor and Presiden-
tial-candidate Dewey had complimented
the Canadian Government on the energy
it had shown in smashing the Communist
spy plot and acquainting Washington with
the trans-border proceedings and move-
ments of some of the plotters. Compli-
ments are due also to the South African
Government for its energy in tackling the
Communist conspiracy in that country.
Only in Australia is the Communist con-
spiracy exempt from Government action.
In Brisbane its agents, unresisted except
by R.A.A.F. lads without orders, have
taken forcible possession of a crowd of
huts in the R.A.A.F.’s Victoria Park. In
Europe this kind of thing would be a
first step towards civil war. In loyal
Queensland the position, as stated by an
Air Force spokesman, quoted by the Syd-
ney “Sun,” is that “we don’t know where
we stand. Our instructions are that we
are not to embarrass the Government, the
Air Board or the Air Minister” —the last
a Mr. Drakeford, who, when the German
war broke out, proposed that Australia’s
part in it should be confined to selling
things like socks and mutton pies to
Britain.
From a thumbnail Who’s Who
biography of McKeil:
Ed. S.P. Sch., Surry Hills.
Perhaps with this in mind, Lang’s
‘‘Century” has accused the scholar of
“picking up a couple of thousand guineas
from the Stevens Government for appear-
ing for colleague Lazzarini before the
S.P. Royal Commission.” In the educa-
tional sense S.P. has another significance
altogether.
From an open letter addressed to Isaac
Isaacs by Julius Stone, Abie Landa’s
protege and an A.B.C. “commentator” :
You permit yourself to state that the
world Zionist body has determined that
if possible Britain is to be side-tracked.
I know no evidence which would justify
such a statement, and I challenge you to
produce any such evidence.
There is now no need for Isaac Isaacs,
or for any other Australian or Briton
whose unassailable position is that he is
an Australian or a Briton of the Jewish
faith, to produce “any such evidence.”
It has been written in blood.
The A.C.T. was shaken last week by the
news that Calwell had been refused a
meal at the Hotel Canberra because he
had paced into the dining-room tieless.
He was “wearing a suit and. an open-
necked yellow shirt.” A yellow shirt.
How interesting!
While the Liberals and Agrarians are
still negotiating in N* S. Wales and Vic-
toria, their counterparts in Westralia,
always on pretty good terms, have arrived
at an election agreement. They are to
“present a united front,” and, if they win,
“the people will be assured of a com-
posite Government with a comprehensive
and progressive programme of legislation
and development.” Although the election
boundaries are heavily against them their
hopes run high, especially as a great many
Westralians are fed up with Canberra’s
Tammany tricks, its savage taxation and
its complete subservience to Communists.
Westralian Labor is uneasy about the
position in half a dozen constituencies:
Avon, which was C.P. for many years;
Pilbara, where only 620 votes were
polled in 1943 ; Perth, which was rarely
Labor till good old Needham came along ;
Middle Swan, a borderline electorate;
Mt. Hawthorn, from which ex-Minister
Millington is retiring—Millington always
polled a strong personal vote —and Bun-
bury, which used to return Newton Moore
when he was Minister and then Premier.
Bunbury is losing Withers, and Gerald-
ton Will be without ex-Premier Willcock.
A straightout loss of six seats would
put the Wise Government out.
Sydney’s two morning papers, splurg-
ing about the McGirrs, Premier Jim and
brothers Greg and Paddy, had plenty to
say about everything but the McGirr
hotel interests. But, then, it isn’t wise
to mention pubs just now, especially if
you’re trying to keep on the right side
of the fence.
Thousands of loyal Sydney people
gathered to see the last of the Duchess
of Gloucester and her children. The
ship steamed away and the crowds turned
for home, touched by the farewell and
sad in the knowledge that something
good had gone out of Australian official
life for a time, and something rotten had
succeeded it.
A Mr. Finnan has succeeded the
younger Evatt as Minister in Charge of
Tourist Activities and Immigration. The
duties are nominal (though the pay is not),
so Mr. Haddock will have plenty of time
to study the form-at-a-glance supplement,
and go to the races. One of his press
admirers has set it on record that Mr.
Finnan-Haddock’s first job was as book-
maker’s clerk (or runner) on the Rand-
wick flat.
“I don’t intend to work ; I’m a Com-
munist and I’m bludging on the Govern-
ment for twenty-five bob a week.” That,
according to a Brisbane detective, was
what an unsavory character charged with
vagrancy told him. The detective added
that bail forfeited and fines paid by the
offender for drunkenness convictions in
two months were almost equal to the un-
employment relief he’d been drawing
from the National Service Office. Pre-
sumably when let loose again he promptly
repaired to the N.S.O. for another hand-
out.
The now-normal (/.<?., dreadful) con-
dition of Queensland ports is being
heavily felt by innocent employees of
shipping companies. Howard Smith has
had to close its Innisfail branch and cut
down the Townsville staff. They need
expect no sympathy from the Communist
bosses of the Townsville and North
Queensland wharfies.
Announcing the elevation of “Uncle
Clive” Evatt to his Ministry of Housing,
McGirr, the new Sydney Premier, re-
marked that his own administration of
Housing had shown him “the vital neces-
sity of grappling with the problem in the
most effective manner.” What detained
him?
“The nation is sad and disillusioned
today. The workers lack incentive to
give their best, and women see no relief
from their burdens.” An Australian sur-
veying his country? No, Churchill sur-
veying his. Like Australia, it has a
“Labor” Government
The House of Commons has been hear-
ing complaints that the Brigade of Guards
has been reduced to ten battalions. Under
the Chifley regime that wouldn’t be a
“brigade” ; it would be two armies.
Leftist writing boys, who still seem to
be able to get anything ' they like into
some Australian papers, concentrated
their fire on Cavendish Bentinck, the
British Ambassador to Poland, accepting
the assertion of Communist Poles that he
had interfered in Polish affairs. One
Leftist story was that Bevin had found
the charges proved and had given
the Ambassador hark from the tomb. It
came out that Bevin had%one into the
question and vindicated the Ambassador,
but that didn’t stop the Polish Commu-
nists or the Leftist writing boys. The
latest story was that Cavendish Bentinck
was to be dismissed because he|had been
concerned in a divorce case.
“X.S.”: Regarding Mr. Mcßell’s ap-
pointment. I sincerely hope and trust the
Governor-General designate doesn’t get
schizophrenia trying to crawl into his own
set.
“Ad Rem” from a suburb with a real
Labor member:
Comical trammies aren’t the only rare things
that occur in my old home town of Richmond
(B. 8/1 / ’47). Probably the safest “Labor”
seat in Australia, it replaced an aged-in-the-
wood veteran with young Keon, who opened
his account by lacing the Communists from
the floor of the House and criticising “poor
old Holloway” on the score of his “policy”
of total ignominious surrender to the
stand-and-deliver tactics of the Red Iron-
workers. Brought to book at the instance of
Corns, Keon ’ was listed for a telling-off by
party boss P. J. Kennedy, Minister for Various
Things, but those who saw Kennedy's gills
after the interview are certain that it
wasn’t Keon who got the telling-off. With
Communist support, a “Keon-must-go” cam-
paign has been launched, and Richmond’s
footbrawl captain has been mentioned as Keon’s
pre-selection opponent. By an odd coincidence
Kennelly is a vice-president of Richmond’s
football club.
A “revised second edition” of the
official biography of Uncle Joe is out in
Moscow, with new claims: —•
After the successful accomplishment of
Stalin’s national strategic plan in 1944,
Russia was in a position, without Allied
aid, to occupy all Germany and liberate
France. This circumstance forced Churchill,
who till then had opposed a second front,
to undertake the invasion of Western
Europe.
This, as everybody remembers, was
quickly followed by the taking of El Ala-
mein by Budenny’s Cossacks and by the
grand charge of the Russian tank columns
into Tripoli and over the mountains of
Italy, leading to the collapse of the Turks
at Alma and the crowning triumph of
Ivan Skavinsky Skivar at the Modder
River.

Society
"AND IT'S PRINTEO
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Jasby”: Crabs were plentiful in the
tidal creek that flowed through our Island
camp, and the major rigged up a net and
caught a supper for the officers’ mess.
The bulk of the feast was consumed, but
the choicest pickings were reserved for
a visitor from Brigade, expected later in
the evening. The major handed them to
Hank, the batman, with instructions to
guard them carefully till called for. Five
minutes later they were in Hand’s tent.
Ten minutes later tfiey were in Hank’s
tentmates. Other events of the evening,
in chronological order, were the arrival
of the visitor from Brigade, the non-
arrival of his crab supper and the carpet-
ing of Hank. Commiserating with Hank,
I asked how he could have been so
foolhardy. “You could have got
away with one or two,” I said,
“but in taking the lot you were simply
asking for trouble.” Hank admitted it,
but explained: “I just couldn’t help it.
Honest, I’ve never seen such big crabs in
my life. You’ve no idea the size of those
claws. They just mesmerised me, and
the next thing I knew I was down in the
tent giving them to the chaps.”
•i«
“Zake”: In view of |the oft-noted
homogeneity- of the Australian accent,
one would not expect national character-
istics to differ much in various cities. Yet
they do, and as an instance I’ll quote
Sydney and Newcastle. Whatever may
be said of Sydney’s manners, it has, when
it is either celebrating or attending sports
or entertainments generally, an abundance
of demonstrativeness and good humor.
But steel-and-coal metropolis “sports”
are a delid-pan lot. Recently I went to
the Newcastle speedway. Cycle-racing is
a pastime calculated to arouse even a
hypochondriac to some semblance of ani-
mation* Yet even when four competitors
on sidecars were flying through the air at
the same time with the greatest of ease
the big crowd looked on in a stony
silence, which stung the announcer to re-
peated but vain requests to “give the boys
a hand —they deserve it.” If ever I feel
impelled to go into the show, business I’ll
“present” it in Newcastle first. If New-
castle gives it applause I’ll risk my show
anywhere.

“Bar Din”: “Jasby’s” callous —and, to
my mind, mildly treasonable —disserta-
tion on military law (B. 5/ 2 / ’47) intrigued
me. Now I appeal for further enlighten-
ment. Throughout my military career my
burning ambition to become a bush
lawyer was constantly frustrated. The
cornerstone of a private soldier’s liberties,
I believed, was access to K.R.Rs. —or the
Manual of Military Law, or whatever it is
they damn and c.b. you with. My
superiors treated this belief as the rankest
superstition. Once, at Amiriya, I went
into the battery office and casually asked
for the book. The 8.5. M., deep in docu-
ments, handed it to me. But no sooner
had I settled comfortably in the shade of
the water-lorry, gloating over the con-
fusion 1 would cause among brigadiers,
ms.p., adjutants and the like, when the
B.S.M. was upon me, his eyes starting out
of his head and his brow furrowed like
an father who has lost his
ration-book in the middle of a tram strike.
He snatched the precious document out
of my hand and pounded back to the
office-tent.

“Adam”: “Eve’s” amusing instances of
unrehearsed effects on the stage (B.
22 1 1 1 ’47) stirred my own memory. The
audience was waiting for the curtain to
rise on the first performance of our
dramatic society. The piano, being part
of the set, was on the stage. After the
overture was played by an unseen merfl-
ber of the cast the curtain should have
risen on an empty stage, but a young
woman had planned to hog the limelight.
She was “discovered” rising from the
piano, giving the impression that she had
just finished playing. The real player,
observing the trick, lost her temper,
rushed from the wings and ad-libbed her
opinion of the impostor in forthright
terms. The audience was moved to ad-
miration for what they thought was a
smash-hit opening and was mystified
when the curtain was dropped in the
middle of the scrap.

“B. A. Ker”; I’ve never noticed the
excellence of Sydney water (B. 22/1/’47),
but “Hamer’s” par. reminded me. A
toss-pot acquaintance of mine returning
home after a six-months stretch of work
“I Wouldn't meddle with those birds, Ada —they have a bad reputation."
on the building of the Federal Capital
called in late at the local pub and
scrounged a couple of bottles for Sunday.
The delighted welcomings of his spouse
and daughter over, he turned in. When
he awoke in the rnorning wife and
daughter had gone to church, and the
two bottles of bliss were gone. It took
over an hour to find the hiding-place, and
about ten minutes to knock over the
beer. Inspiration came as he was pre-
paring for one of those frigid, silent
reprimands. He filled the, dead marines
with water, sealed them again and placed
them back in the plant. A cold aloof
meal was about to begin when he asked:
“Did you notice two bottles of water
when you unpacked my bag? I brought
them down from Canberra for you to try
—best water I ever tasted.”
“Ajax”: Recent enthusiasts for Sydney
water as a beverage obviously don’t live
in North Shore suburbs. From a few
days before Christmas to well into Janu-
ary the “effluent” from our taps varied
in color from rich brown ale to full-
bodied stout and no afiiount of run-off
improved matters. A bath at times meant
a mud pack and laundering was unthink-
able. This pollution is quite common on
the North Shores line.

“Wusslean”: Don’t tell me there’s no
timber shortage. When the octogenarian
in our street died during a hot-weather
spell, relatives were alarmed to hear from
the undertaker’s head man that the
funeral could not be arranged within three
days. Material for coffin-making was in
short supply, he explained. After super-
vising the removal of the body on an
ordinary hospital stretcher from the house
to a coach, for transport to the funeral
parlor, he expressed the firm’s regrets that
present circumstances prevented them
from conducting affairs in a more fitting
manner. “These are bad times to live
in,” he concluded, “and I am sorry to
say, they are just as bad to die in.” A
Federal Parliamentarian, with half an
hour’s free broadcasting at his disposal,
could not have described our condition
under the New Order with greater
accuracy.

“Cot”: Humorous maritime signals
(B. 22/1/’47) weren’t all ship-to-ship
messages. Fanning Island, a coral atoll
about 6ft, above sea-level, was on the
receiving end of a, good one. A Yank
merchant ship, delivering supplies to the
island, had difficulty in finding the place,
steaming past it twice before locating it.
When she eventually pulled in to the
anchorage the captain hailed an inhabi-
tant on the wharf with “Why don’t you
anchor your goldarned island? I sailed
right over it twice!”

“F.S.”: A curious condition of one of
the prizes awarded annually at the
National Gallery school in Melbourne
has come to light as a result of • their
present exhibition. Two scholarships of
£5OO each were founded by Mrs.
Sara Levi, one for the best work of the
year in the painting division and the
other, called the Alfred and Rachel Levi
scholarship, for drawing. A proviso in
the will states that, in making the awards,
preference should be given to Jewish
students. Art having nothing to do with
nationalities, it is an extraordinary thing
that any board of art trustees should* ever
have accepted the bequest and that none
has protested against it. William Bergner
won one award this year for a couple
of fish on a plate and two turnips, which
may or may not be a of work,
but which completely viilates the con-
ventions of the Gallery-school teachers.
Another quaint bequest was that of
Grace Joel, who gave a £5O prize for
the best half-nude, which half not being
stated. If “modernists” weren’t such con-
ventional'creatures they could long since
have put the judges in a most embarrass-
ing position. It would be interesting to
know what was in the donor’s mind when
she made her condition. If the prize
had been for landscape she would hardly
have stipulated half a gum-tree.
“R. Volt”; “Ken” (B. 29/1/’47) mar-
vels at a telegraph operator being able
to pick the sound of his own instrument
from the clatter of 30 others. That was
commonplace in every telegraph office I
ever worked in. A really remarkable
faculty, however, was possessed by an old-
time operator at the La Perouse cable
station. He could receive press from
Sydney for transmission to MX. at 150
l.p.m. and carry on a conversation at the
same time. To test him, fellow-clerks
would engage him in conversation in the
middle of a message and he would stop
writing typewriters weren’t used in
those days—swing round in his chair and
listen. Then he would turn back to his
pad and catch up, and he never made an
error.
“Butcher’s Carter”: I don’t know
whether a switch-girl can identify
familiar numbers by the sound of the
telephone bell, but in my pre-war job
on a meat-delivery round I had quite a
few cats on the run that would come in
a hurry over the fences at the sound of
my rich baritone calling “Butch!” One
customer told me that her cat would
sleep undisturbed near the fire oblivious
to the cries of the baker, iceman, grocer
or other such prosaic characters, but at
the call of “Butch” he showed immediate
and lively interest. Not only that; he
could identify from other motor-vehicle
noises the particular beat of my motor-
cycle. But perhaps he was •an extra
smart cat.

“Adelaide”: An entirely new one has
been tried on the police at Semaphore
(SA.). An 18-year-old visitor from
Broken Hill was found pushing a car
along a street and explained that he was
merely “testing his strength.” Fined £lO
for “illegally using” the car.

“Pookie”: Tell “Spasebo” (B. 5/ 2 /*'47)
that the Russians still sing—l caught ’em
at it in various parts of Germany during
the war. After the early German drive
into the Ukraine Russkis came into our
Austrian Stalag in thousands —emaciated,
filthy, weak, really starved ; not all of
them were soldiers and some were boys
of 14 and less. As part of normal camp
routine they were “deloused,” with hot
showers, their clothing being bundled
into steaming containers. Then, naked
and huddled—a pitiful sight—put on to
the snow. When the cold air hit them
they toppled, like wheat before a binder.
We killed off numbers of survivors our-
selves, by ignorant kindness in the matter
of food ; but there were still thousands.
These, a few nights later, started to sing.
It was a still night and the singing began
as a low, swelling murmur, something like
the sea heard at a distance. It rose and
fell, seemingly from all over the camp,
then reached its full pitch and volume,
sank, and was taken up in part-singing.
Perhaps it was a national festival they
were celebrating ; perhaps it was the cold
moonlight on ice-sheeted snow that re-
minded them of home ; whatever it was,
it was music, “Spasebo’s” music of the
people, and extraordinarily impressive. I
wasn’t in Germany when it was “liber-
ated” by the Russians, so I didn’t hear
any Red Army songs there. But in Mar-
seilles I heard a battalion of Russians
enlisted in the German Army, and their
singing, tuneful enough, was uninspiring
Russian nor German.

“Flea”: Who wants a comfortable
little room, brand-new and strongly con-
structed under an architect’s supervision,
12ft. by 12ft., with 9ft. walls, two fine
windows, nicely-upholstered inside, suit-
able renfoval? Hold on a minute, Dig.
Sorry, but Bernborough copped the lot
and is taking it with him to U.S.A. It’s
tough about the delay in your timber
order, but you must realise that priorities
still exist.
* * * *
“Eve”: Eleven colored seamen climbed
on to the top floor of the double-decker
bus as it left Woolloomooloo. What
interested the seamen was, in the order of
excitement, the height of buildings,
statues, and a dark-skinned woman on the
footpath. Things that didn’t interest them
a bit were: gardens, horses, me. They
were a happy crowd and showed traits
common to any group of sightseers.
There were the “funny man” ; one who
pretended not to be interested in any-
thing but looked through the corners of
his eyes just the same and didn’t miss
a thing; one who snapped “To ferry-
boats” to the conductor in tones of such
rudeness that he was obviously covering
up an inferiority complex; and one who
was the worrier of the party. He made
at least five attempts to leave the bus
before the right stop and was obviously
relieved when at last they were all safely
out. Even then he made a quick count of
the party, and only when he’d assured
himself that everybody was present did
he march off contentedly to the ferries.
* * * *
“Yair”: Under George-street, on the
sides of the dim ramp leading up to
Wynyard station, are colonies of cats,
some simply strays, others seekers after
sanctuary from city traffic. A lady I
know feeds them regularly. But was she
furious the other day! A sour sort of
chap had watched her feeding her strays
and, when she remarked that she cooked
the fish specially for them, he snapped,
“Wouldn’t it save a lot of trouble if you
just cooked the cats?”
« * * ♦
“Harold Hardupp”: Even at a cricket
match the pedant gets his opportunity. A
batsman, after a rocky start, was settling
down to some hard hitting and the noisy
approval of one bystander annoyed his
neighbor. “He should’ve been out twice
in his first over,” he remarked slowly.
Then rose the voice of the pedant. “No
batsman can be out twice in one over,”
he corrected. “The right thing to say is
‘Twice in one over he should have been
out.”’ There was one man who was pre-
pared to argue; he said bluntly that the
pedant was wrong and got the argument
going. The pedant was baited into a
condition of wrathful indignation before
the challenger explained “Three times in
one over he should have been out.”
“Clean bowled!” chortled those around
him.
A HEARTENING FORECAST,
“The present’ supply of wines and spirits, except
for imported lines, is now very close to total demand,
and in another month or two the same will probably
apply to beer.”
—President of N.S.W. Brewers’ Association.
Glad tidings of great joy, one may assume,
For an infinity of cheery souls,
But apt to deepen the habitual gloom
Of those who’d sooner tighten up controls
Of what the vintners sell, having no room
In their philosophy for flowing bowls
“With beaded bubbles winking at the brim”
Which thirsty customers absorb with vim.
Since Father Noah —if he it was —invented
A way to make hard liquor from the grape,
And to remote posterity presented
The means from water-drinking to escape,
What tiddleys, spirituous and fermented,
The world has used in every form and shape,
What countless remedies have been disbursed
To meet the importunities of thirst!
The Gyppo, ft’s a well-established story,
First glimpsed the possibilities of malt;
To him there definitely goes the glory
Of being the earth’s first brewer. But a halt
Came then. The beef he fashioned suo more
Had clearly one inevitable fault;
Its destined mate, the hop, was not to be
Revealed for many a weary cehtury.
Our rude forefathers washed down many a
trencher
Of meat with swizzle designated mead,
Too sweet to be a satisfactory quencher
Of healthy thirsts with certainty and speed,
Yet with a quantum suff. of kick, I’ll venture,
To cope with any Bacchanalian need.
No hops arrived for England’s national
Tipple until the reign of bluff King Hal.
Beer and Britannia! How apt the linking
Of these two words, some bygone poet wrote.
So, if it isn’t merely wishful thinking
Of the authority whose words I quote,
The nut-brown stimulant may soon be sinking
In pre-war style down many a patching thtoat,
And once again (who knows?) Bung’s patrons
munch
Therewith the near-forgotten counter lunch.

“Uco”: Just another of those things
that couldn’t happen anywhere else but
in Sydney—l hope. Through labor
trouble, transport trouble, soap shortage
or other unexplained cause the tables at
the Dutch restaurant were covered with
white paper instead of the customary
cloths. Not exactly elegant, of course,
but the just a!s good. At
least it did until a couple of late-arrivals
came in and sat therdSelves at a corner
table. No paper covers for them! Be-
fore they were properly sealed the papers
had disappeared, to be replaced by a
white damask cloth with table napkins to
match. Other diners whispered. Im-
portant visitors frorn abroad? The new
G.-G.? Not exactly. Just a jockey at
present under indefinite suspension by

“Suite One”: ■ The news of the refloat-
ing of the trans-Tasman liner Wanga-
nella after 18 days on Barrett’s Reef at the
entrance to Wellington Harbor was
doubly welcome. The loss of a fine ship
is always tragic, but with the present
shortage of merchant tonnage throughout
the world even thb smallest vessel can ill
be spared, let alone a 10,000-ton passenger
ship, Wanganella, built in 1931 and
bought on the stocks by Huddart Parker,
ran on the Australia-New Zealand
service until war caused her to be refitted
as a hospital ship. Under the Red Cross
she carried thousands of sick and
wounded and the was was over she
brought back p.-0.-w. from Japan and
troops from the islands. Her stranding
occurred on the trip that marked her
return to the Wellington run. From the
first the owners were hopeful of saving
the vessel, but as the weeks slipped by and
attempts failed it seemed that the rocks
had claimed her for good. J. E. John-
stone, the Australian diver who was re-
sponsible for salvaging the Niagara’s gold,
flew across the Tasman to inspect the
wreck and found her fast on three ledges
of rock as well as wedged between two
"I Wouldn't wear your chiffon creation, Miss — there's quite a southerly
blowing."
projecting rocks. He reported that the
ledges seemed to be crumbling under the
weight of the vessel and that this might
prove a decisive factor in later salvage
attempts. An Auckland engineer, Thomas
otone, writing to the Wellington “Domi-
™n, ’ criticised the methods up till
then used to tow the ship off and sug-
gested a “radial swing” method, using the
rocks as a pivot. After attempts to build
a coffer dam had failed, this idea seems
to have been adopted, as the cables speak
of the stern being swung, eastward, loosen-
ing her from the rocks and enabling her
to back out into the fairway. No doubt
repairs will take some time, but all ship-
lovers will rejoice at the rescue of a tine
ship which had seemed likely to become
a total loss.
“Uramao”: Barrett’s Reef has claimed
many vessels since the windjammer
Sobraon shivered her timbers on it on
October 16, 1848 ; the largest next to
the present victim was the American
Golden Harvest in 1933. The reef has
two associations with Wellington’s early
history. The Plimmer family—as closely
connected with the Windy City as Par-
liament itself —sprang from John Plimmer,
whose first residence on the beach was the
hull of the ship Inconstant, wrecked on
the reef in 1850. It was known as Noah’s
Ark. Barrett’s Hotel derived its name
from an old pilot who did a spot of Whal-
ing and later became proprietor of that
pub.

“Smouge”; With our third anniversary
and my ninth year in the Navy fast
approaching, Mrs. Smouge and I were
discussing the future and whether I should
sign on again after completing my 12
years. I held there was plenty of time
to think of that when things had settled
down a bit more. “But it’s no time at all
since we were married,” she pointed out
earnestly. “Three years ; it seems only
yesterday. And you’ve only got three
years more in the Navy and young
Smouge will be five years old and will
need new clothes and schooling and, oh,
how time flies!” And she rushed off to
the kitchen to do the dishes While I
sneaked in to have a look at the young-
ster, half-expecting to find a young school-
boy lying in the cot and my “civvies”
hanging in the wardrobe.

“Pitt St.”: The current rash of column-
ists in the Sydney daily papers provides
readers with a good deal more amuse-
ment than they suspect, as witness
this from the gent, who shines from the
“Sun”: —
Procession: A group of people stood at
the corner of Ocean-street ,and Edgecliff-
road from 6.45 to 7 o’clock last night
waiting for a city-bound tram.
Seventeen “Waverley Depot” trams in
succession came along.
When the 16th turned, one gent said,
“I’ll jump on my hat if another one comes
along.”
He did.
Personally, I’ll eat the hat and let the
bloke jump on me if anyone can show
me a tram, bound for “Waverley
Depot” or anywhere else, passing that
corner.
* * * *
“Yarrasider”: I can’t join in “Justin’s”
lament (B. 8/1/’47) for the passing of the
livewire salesman. I had several tries
at the game; my longest, a couple of
months hawking vacuum cleaners. The
firm believed ruggedly in private enter-
prise, particularly in relation to its sales-
men. No salary was paid, only com-
mission. As the firm put it, there was no
limit to What you could earn ; you could
have a millionaire’s income—if only you
sold enough vacs. There were early-
morning meetings at H.Q., where we
gathered inspiration from the sales-
manager, picked up the latest “lurks”
from the veterans and sang rollicking
songs—the sales-manager wrote the words
to popular tunes—about the carefree and
prosperous life of a vacuum-cleaner
salesman. Through these “sessions” flowed
an endless stream of battlers, who hung
on grimly for a few weeks and then
dropped out. Hard as it was, I had my
brief hour of triumph. After a blank
first few weeks I suddenly sold three
vacs, in one day. I never sold another.
A month later the sales-manager began
laboring the subject of flash-in-the-pan
salesmen in his morning discourses, and
taking the hint I, too, dropped out.
“ Let's move our table — I'm sure that man's been eating garlic."
“Bamekaw”; Our C.O. was very chary
about dishing out promotion, holding that
a man must earn his stripes. Lofty had
himself paraded to find out why he was
consistently passed over in the rare pro-
motion lists. “You realise,” said the Old
Man, “that an n.c.o. must possess intelli-
gence, tact, and be able to command re-
spect, yet retain his popularity." Have
you those qualities?” “Well, not if you
say I haven’t, Sir,” said Lofty. “All the
same I could have been a corporal within
three months of my enlistment.” “Oh,
how so?” “By joining the Provosts,”
snarled Lofty as he made for the exit.
* * * *
“Gunwheel”; “Work-watching” is a
popular pastime in any city. An excava-
tion will draw a crowd any day. A
window-dresser will be watched by the
hour. But demolitions are first-favorites.
In Sydney recently, workmen were carry-
ing out groundfloor alterations in a large
block of buildings. Main work consisted
of breaking down an interior wall of
bricks, and the workmen were hard at
it with hammer and cold chisel. A wag
chalked up on the barrier across the door-
way: “Don’t stand outside and watch.
Step inside and try your hand with the
hammer. Free!” I didn’t see anyone
take advantage of the offer, but I did
notice that there weren’t nearly so many
onlookers after the notice appeared!
si! * *
“Evemer”: Met a nice old chap in the
Mining Museum, but he was bitter when
I mentioned prospecting, “I only come
down here to see the view from the
windows,” he flared. “Don’t talk about
mining or prospecting. It was the curse
of my life.” I said, sympathetically, “No
luck, eh?” “None at all,” he sngrled,
adding, “Oh, plenty money, if that’s what
you mean. But on one of my prospect-
ing trips I ... I don’t know to this day
what came over me. Must have been
mad. Met a girl ”he paused, then
finished savagely, “and I married her!”
I left him moodily looking through the
windows at the Harbor.
« * * »
“Craiser”; The cableman reports an
ironic art story. A Boston collector
bought in Italy a “priceless” fifteenth-
century primitive. Unable to get it out
of the country without a Government
licence, he got a local artist to paint a
landscape on it which had no difficulty
in getting past the Customs. When the
connoisseur got it home he employed V
“restorer” to scrape the landscape off,
and along with the modern work went
the “primitive,” disclosing underneath a
painting of Victor Emmanuel’s coronation
(1900). Still, this isn’t half as ironic as
what recently happened in U.S.A. at a
famous gallery. It had acquired a Titian
and had it X-rayed to test its authenticity.
The photo revealed another picture under-
neath it. Phrt of the surface paint was
scraped away, disclosing a pair of angels.
The ironic part about it is that the gallery
authorities were delighted, ‘having got
two Titians at the price of one. Actually
they had destroyed the picture and got
something which a genius had painted
out because it didn’t fulfil his conception.
* •* * *
“North”: Having done battle with the
work, and temporarily discouraged my
marauding goats from devouring the wash-
ing, I turned on the wireless programme
I’d been trying to make time to hear. The
north has been luring me further and
further for years, and this was entitled
North of the Nullarbor, with Michael
Terry, “traveller and historian,” to tell
of the site of the rocket range and the
type of country over which the missiles
will travel. With one ear on the calling
nannies without I sat down to relax.
Just what occurred in A.B.C. circles I
can’t guess, unless someone took the
wrong record. No one explained just
what happened to the advertised Nullar-
bor Plains talk. The “traveller and
historian” chose another subject—goats.
* * * *
“Clooter”: A bright note was heard
amid all this deadly seriousness about
giving the aboriginal a chance to become
a second McKell, and it piped up,
too, while a party of earnest blokes
was gathering at Canberra to see about
doing the same for the Pacific Islanders.
It came from Darwin, telling how a
bunch of abos, their lubras and their
dogs held a stop-work meeting outside the
town and decided to. strike for £4 10s.
*a week and other things. After the usual
buck-passing and conferences, some sort
of a settlement was reached, though
whether on the basis of more witchety
grubs or an extra ration of pitched isn’t
clear. Anyhow, it showed how quickly
the native can learn white pfeller fashion
if given a chance, but I doubt whether the
aforementioned serious blokes saw any-
thing funny in it. It’s pretty hard to see
humor in anything these days.
*lf * * *
“Sniffle”: The British Health Depart-
ment is in search of groups of 24 people
to spend 14 days of quiet living, to eat
the equivalent of 10 Christmas dinners
every day, to snooze in tranquillity and be
paid for doing it. Only fly in the Health
Department’s ointment is that the groups
must act as guinea pigs for experiments
with the common cold. The holidayers
will have the advantage of being one day
able to tell their grandchildren “I helped
to save mankind. Back in 1947 the
Health Department asked my aid and I
gave it. With twenty-three other brave
souls I was sprayed with cold germs and
then inoculated, fumigated and gassed
with inhalations. We swallowed pills till
we rattled like dice-boxes, but we never
surrendered. We served so that our
grand-children (stop sneezing, Albert); as
I was saying, we served that our grand-
children might never know (somebody
get him a handkerchief) the rigors of the
common cold.”
« * * »
“Spare Corp”: Crossing the Channel
when sub. activity was at its height in
1917, we had ample evidence of the
“alarming figures” of ship losses. The
troopship Marathon, going at top speed
to cross the danger zone, its whole struc-
ture aquiver with the force of its driving,
passed through masses of floating wreck-'
age ; one impressive' bit was a floating
deckhouse with two nurses stretched on
the slanting side. Dead, of course; but
had they been alive there would have
been no pause in our headlong rush ; the
lives of 1500 troops could not be risked.
We had a close call; the sharp shots and
sounds of muffled explosions caused a
rush from the mess-tables. A spreading
mass of oiliness through which a de-
stroyer, which had rammed and sunk
the attacking submarine, was steaming
triumphantly was all that remained to
be seen. In Plymouth the lines of
damaged vessels, including the Orient,
her stern missing, supplied a further
chapter of the story.
WHAT PUZZLES CARDUS.
“Why do perspiring’ groundlings, who like to see
batsmen get runs quickly or get out, persist in watch-
ing Test matches V” —Neville Cardus.
Partly, I judge, to air their firm conviction
And emphasise on, all within their reach
Their right to demonstrate that no restriction
Is laid upon Free Speech.
And more, perhaps, to buttress their persuasions
They can compare, when once their money’s
paid.
The way how cricket’s played on these occasions
With how they’d like it played.
The cautious batsman, plodding and laborious,
Whose methods they account so deadly slow,
They seek to stimulate with their uproarious
Appeals to “Have a Go!”
Tired bowlers, too (who knows?), may find
incisive
Spurs to renewed exertions in the shout,
In part lugubrious and in part derisive:
“You’ll never get ’em out!”
Well, barrackers must have their inhibitions,
Like other critics, and at any rate
It takes all sorts of men and all conditions
To make a thumping gate.
Yet those who tell the world with such flam-
boyance
A game depends on firewprks for its zest
Must surely get less pleasure than annoyance
Out of a six-day Test.

nterior decorator
advises wives that
“the time to plan
your decorations
is before the
home is built”
Miss Dorothy Senior, A.S.T.C., is well
known by her weekly press features and
broadcasts and is an authority on in-
terior decoration for the Australian way
of life. She makes here some practical
suggestions to new home builders.
Curtains, Windows
Curtains which hang to the floor
are much more effective than those
which just touch the window sill.
So make sure that your windows
permit" long curtains.
Walls, Ceilings
Avoid a lot of little pictures. One
Or two large pictures are prefer-
able. The walls should be a
decoration in themselves and I
always have walls, doors and all
woodwork tinted in the same
colour. Use the same soft pastel
or ivory colours throughout a small
house, relying on soft furnishings
for colour contrasts. Cane-ite walls
and Ivory Cane-ite ceilings make it
easy to carry out this single-tone
colour scheme as a beautiful back-
ground for your furniture.
Floor Coverings
It is always surprising how much
more spacious a home seems once
all the floors are covered to match.
This isn’t always possible, but
polished floors with mgs give the
same effect. That is why I ap-
prove of Cane-ite for walls ind
Ivory Cane-ite for ceilings. Cane-
ite makes it so easy to have all
rooms of the home in harmony.
Bedrooms
People always wonder why my bed-
rooms are so different. It is simp-
ly because I won’t £ave bedroom
suites. There is no reason why
even the smallest home should not
have one wall entirely given over
to built-in cupboards. The effect
is delightful, and gives absolutely no
impression that you’ve got a wall
packed full of clothes and shoes.
Insulation
Cane-ite walls and Ivory Cane-ite
ceilings keep your home cool in
summer and warm in winter. Your
home is a much mor£ pleasant
place to live in all the year round.
So easy to erect it brings down
your building costs, too.

The South Seas and Defence.
“Ek Dum”: After a week of talk in
Canberra, staged on the initiative of Dr.
Evatt, who hunts international chairman-
ships as a small girl hunts autographs,
it has been decided to establish a South
Sea Commission. This move, accord-
ing to “S. M. Herald,” marks another
step forward in international co-opera-
tion.
The participants in the commission
will be the Netherlands, New Zealand,
the United Kingdom, France, the United
States and “Australia” (Dr. Evatt).
The chairman (of course) will be Dr.
Evatt, with Mr. Ward for an unofficial
offsider, Mr. Ward says that the objec-
tive of the conference was “self-govern-
ment for the Pacific native.” And within
two years it is hoped that there will be a
bigger and better conference when
natives have met and formulated points
for the commission’s consideration.
The natives who are to be included
are‘limited in numbers—about 1,690,000
of various degrees of culture and civilisa-
tion, of whom 918,000 ape to be estimated
to be in the Australian zone. It is doubt-
ful whether Dr. Evatt and Mr. Ward
would know one type from another. They
appear to envision a large, smooth comity
of “fuzzy-wuzzy angels” burning to be
“freed” from the slavery of British and
Australian Simon Legrees and taught the
blessings of democracy, so that they can
institute all the features so prominent
under our “Labor” civilisation.
Most of the nations concerned are
coming in with reservations. The United
States, for instance, is not including the
natives of its islands, taken over from
the Japanese, or any others of moment
under the scheme. The Dutch, with their
teeming millions of lower-grade islanders,
some of whom badly need reforming,
are including only Dutch New Guinea, a
wild and inaccessible country. The re-
sult, therefore, is that Messrs. Evatt and
Ward, without consulting Parliament or
anybody else, are giving away a very
large part of the control of New Guinea
and Papua (an Australian possession, not
a mandate) to a number of other
countries, while assuming little share in
deciding the fate of other Pacific natives.
And since they are giving away (on the
Australian taxpayers’ behalf) more than
anybody else, they have agreed to pay
twice as much as the United Kingdom,
New Zealand and the Netherlands and
more than twice as much as the United
States and France,
It was solemnly recorded that the South
Sea Commission would “not be con-
cerned with the defence” of the territories
with which it deals, but this is nonsense.
Everything which affects the native
attitude of mind and influences it to-
wards independence influences defence.
In the case of New Guinea and Papua
this is a vital matter, because, despite Mr.
Ward’s opposition to defending them in
World War 11, they are the stepping-
stones for invasion of Australia. On
their condition and attitude the Common-
wealth’s safety might at some future time
depend.
Messrs. Ward and Evatt, however, are
all for developing in them a spirit which
will lead to self-government. The next
stage to that in the course of nature will
be for the Indonesian “comrades” next
door to stress their own affinity with Mr.
Ward’s former subjects. Then Australia
may some day find itself in the position
of having to defend a native people
whose policy is against its own. Or it
may find the native people to whom Mr.
Ward is proposing to hand independence
on a platter calling on some Asiatic
people to defend it from Mr. Ward or
his heirs or successors.
The Japs, for instance. If an inde-
pendent Government of New Guinea
decided to make a defensive treaty with
the Japanese directed against Australia
and the White Australia policy, what
could the Commonwealth do about it in
the light of Evatt-Ward policies?

“Ek Dum”: There has been “issued
under the direction and by the authority
of the Australian Minister for Informa-
tion, the- Honorable A. A. Calwell,
M.H.R.,” a “short history of Australia’s
part in the Pacific War,” with an intro-
duction by Mr. Calwell.
The frontispiece is a full-page photo-
graph of “The Right Honorable John
Curtin, Prime Minister of the Common-
wealth, October, 1941, to July, 1945,”
with underneath the quotation:
Australia is a nation stripped for war.
Our minds are set on attack rather than
defence. We believe that attack is the best
defence. Here in the Pacific it is the only
defence we know. It means risks, but
safety first is the devil’s catchword today.
There is also a full-page photograph of
General MacArthur, and there are inch-
high photographs, inset into the text, of
Generals Waved, Clowes, Vasey,
Wootten, Savige, Eichelberger and Gor-
don Bennett, who gets a slightly bigger
picture than the rest.
Generals Blarney, Northcott (C. 0.5.)
and Berryman, who commanded the
Second Australian Corps during the only
operations that could be called major
operations in the New Guinea war after
the actions at Buna —the capture of the
Huon Peninsula —and who was liaison
officer with General MacArthur, do not
rate portraits.
It is gathered from the volume that
Australia was instrumental in winning
the Pacific War. The American and
British Navies, the most powerful naval
striking force ever mobilised against an
enemy, the 5,000,000 Americans and the
couple of million British and Indians, not
to mention the Dutch, Chinese and others
and' the New Zealanders, all played
second fiddle.
Mr. Calwell is pleased to authorise
a tribute to “the masterful leadership of

General Douglas MacArthur and the
powerful aid of the United States,” but
it is fairly clear that the victory stemmed
from the magnificent courage, peerless
foresight, strategic genius, tactical mag-
nificence and strength in general of the
Honorable Arthur Calwell’s superb fight-
ing colleagues in Canberra.
Blame the British!
There is criticism of the United King-
dom and its forces:
Not since 1781 when Cornwallis with
7000 British regulars surrendered to
Washington at Yorktown had the British
Empire suffered such a blow. Singapore
gave Japan her major victory in the whole
campaign just 69 days after Pearl Harbor.
It was the greatest United Mahons setback
in the Pacific war.
Nothing is said about the fact that
Singapore’s defence was Australia’s
equally with Britain’s, or that Australia’s
two brigades were sent there in the
of “Labor” opposition.
It had long been tacitly agreed that
when the war did break out in the Pacific
it would be mainly Uncle Sam’s baby.
And Uncle Sam had not been in the
midst of bombing for years, as was
Britain. His main strategic bases were
close to the scene of battle. His leading
commanders were not inextricably in-
volved elsewhere.
Yet Uncle lost the Philippines and he
lost his powerful Pacific fleet. He lost,
on open aerodromes in the Philippines,
the bombing force which might have*
saved the invasion of Singapore. And
President Roosevelt had hesitated for
days after he knew that the Japanese
were moving south and when prompt
action could have prevented the advance
from Indo-China and warded off the
Hawaiian attack. For these things, the
Americans atoned later in mote than full
measure.
The Japanese, as everybody knows,
burnt their codes throughout the South-
east Asia area on November 26-28, 1941.
The U.S. Intelligence knew how the fires
were burning from day to day.
The loss of Singapore was a mere in-
cident in the war, which had little mili-
tary effect on the outcome of events after
it was certain that the Philippines must
fall and after the U.S. Navy had been
temporarily smashed to bits at Pearl
Harbor, these events having made the iso-
lation Of Malaya inevitable. They, not
the fall of Singapore, made the Japanese
drive southward possible. Singapore was
only vital as a western base which it was
anticipated that the U.S. Navy would use.
Yet all the blame is thrown upon the
unfortunate British, whose generosity en-
abled us to get help quickly, who re-
leased our own divisions at once when
they might have been tempted not to
provide shipping to carry them, and who
denuded their own Atlantic defence at the
height of the submarine war to stop the
Japanese incursion into the Indian Ocean
which offered the most dangerous avenue
of attack on Australia.
However, it is pleasing to know —or it
would be pleasing if it were true —that
“Labor” was right all the time and others
wrong:—
One reason Australia was unprepared
to fight off large-scale invasion was her
generosity in meeting the demands on her
manpower, industry and services made dur-
ing the war against Germany and Italy.
Another reason was that the ideas which
London and Washington had in December,
1941, about the intelligence and efficiency
of the Japanese were sadly astray. The
stern logic of events from December t 6
March prompted the scrapping of these
ideas, and the co-ordination of the closest
type between Britain, the United States
and Australia was recognised as the prime
essential.
“Generosity”! When our own existence
was at stake!
It is not mentioned that “Labor” had
had nd share in the generosity which sent
the fighting divisions to Africa, or that,
while in opposition, its efforts had been
directed,towards preventing them obtain-
ing the battle training without which
there would have been no Australian
fighting force worth the name until 1944.
American Delays
Both British and Americans knew
from July, 1941, onwards everything
about Japanese intentions. They knew
virtually for certain, within a week before
the blow at Pearl Harbor, that Japan
was moving to attack. x
The British at that time were desper-
ately attempting to ’secure U.S. action,
but in the face of the facts they got
nowhere until Pearl Harbor was blasted.
They could not find out even what the
U.S. would do if Japan flooded Thailand
with men, and if the British felt bound
to occupy the Kra Isthmus to prevent
the Japs bursting through into the Indian
Ocean.
While these inquiries were in progress
before the Pearl Harbor business, Mr.
Roosevelt was on holiday.
These and other facts do not appear.
But it is suggested that Pacific stra-
tegic plans were virtually invented by
the Curtins. They were nof; the plans
were made without reference to them
and contravened their ideas. It is claimed
that the Australian Government on
February 22 asked for General Mac-
Arthur to command the Pacific War. Its
actual request was for General Brett,
and was made several days later.
Nevertheless, everything and every-
body were wrong except the Canberra
geniuses until inspired by the ringing
voice of Mr. Beasley, who had been
arguing, a few months earlier that Aus-
tralia’s part in the war should not be
a fighting part but a food-producing part,
and by that of Mr, Forde, who intoned:
We will have to fight as' Australians
have never feught before,- for our very
existence and for the soil we inherited
from our tough forefathers. We are a
tough people! ! We will not be intimidated
by Japanese threats.
Inspired by the Fordes, it appears that
“the myth of Japanese invincibility was
to receive its first violent jolt in New
Guinea, and the Australians were the
first to administer the jolt.”
It does not detract from the heroism
of Australian troops that this is not true.
The first jolt which the Japanese received
was his rebuff by the Royal Navy and
Air Force in Ceylon, which General
Eisenhower has termed the turning-point
of the Pacific War.
The second was in the battle of the
Coral Sea, in which the bulk of the forces
were American.
The next setback to the Japanese was
in the Midway Battle. And Australia
cannot even claim to have given the
southward drive its first land setback, for
that credit belongs to the U.S. Marines
on Guadalcanal.
The Course for Valor
Generally speaking, Mr. Calwell’s
book is marred by a style which makes
it sound more .like an advertising
pamphlet than a dignified national docu-
ment ; but it has its humors. For in-
stance, its quotation from the speech of
Mr. Curtin on behalf of his Govern-
ment, only one member of whom (and
he not an Australian) was a serving
soldier in 1914-18:
We have no qualms here. There is no
fifth columh in this country [this was a
couple of days after Mr. Forde had “ex-
posed” the dreadful Australia First con-
spiracy which allegedly had put the whole
country in danger]... .We will not easily
yield a yard of our soil. We have great
space here, and tree by tree, village by
village and town by town, we will fall
back if we must For, remember, we
are the Anzac breed. Our men stormed
Gallipoli. They swept through the Libyan
Desert. They were the men of Tobruk....
Australia is a nation stripped for war. Our
minds are set on attack rather than de-
fence. We believe, in fact, that attack is
the best defence. .
All this fustian at the time when the
Canberrans were shrieking for 25 divi-
sions, and when the Government had
gone almost wild with panic at the
thought that a single Australian division
on the water might be diverted for a few
days to help save Rangoon, and that it
might have to bear the political repercus-
sions if proper provision were not made
for that division’s “safety.”
Mr. Calwell and his colleagues at
Canberra would exhibit more evidence of
belonging to the “Anzac breed” if they
stood up to the truth about events in
the early parts of 1942 and (1) arranged
with the British and American Govern-
ments to issue a White Book giving the
detailed correspondence between Gov-
ernments and military staffs in, 1941-42
during the formative stages of the war ;
(2) permitted the appointment of inquiry
commissions into the tragic, affairs of
Java and Timor, the loss of Ambon
and Rabaul and the loss of civilian popu-
lation in the latter place ; (3) permitted
an inquiry as to whether there was negli-
gence on the part of the Ministry in re-
lation to the protection of civilians at
Darwin and (4) issued a White Paper de-
tailing the whole of the Government’s
defence actions between October 6 and
December 6, 1941.
If Mr. Chifley and Mr. Calwell will
take these courses they will at least earn
the right to claim moral courage for
themselves. And if they can justify their
own unsupported stories of their prowess
as war-makers the world will surely erect
a monument to them.

Viscount Bledisloe, visiting these parts
in his 80th year on a goodwill tour to
agricultural societies of Australia and
Maoriland, is president of the Royal
Agricultural Society, describes himself as
a country squire, and in Who’s Who in-
cludes among his recreations agriculture,
cattle-raising and pig-breeding. During
his term as Governor-General of New
Zealand, 1930-1935, he astonished many
farmers with his practical knowledge. On
his arrival in Brisbane from Sydney, Lord
Bledisloe remarked that he had never
seen more fertile land than the area be-
tween Grafton and Brisbane. His opinion
is worth having ; there is probably no
man in the world today who has carried
out wider investigations of agricultural
land.
In the matter of headgear British ad-
mirals have usually conformed to King’s
Regulations, though the poet has recorded
of Essex during an attack on Cadiz that
“he tossed his bonnet to wind and sea
and under the guns he ran.” Admiral
Marc Mitscher, dead in America at 60,
will probably be remembered in Ameri-
can history less as commander of the
famous Task Force 58, which harried the
Japs in a way that would have appealed
to any Elizabethan seadog, than for the
fact that it was his habit to direct opera-
tions from an armchair on his flagship’s
bridge wearing a baseball cap, Mitscher,
who finished up as C.-in-C. U.S. Atlantic
Fleet, was an airman-sailor. A Navy
flier even before the First World War, he
did much to develop the carrier fleet
which became so important a part of
the American Navy. When the Japs hit
Pearl Harbor he was in command of the
carrier Hornet, in which vessel he took
part in the Midway victory. It was from
Hornet’s deck that Doolittle’s planes took
off for their raid on Tokyo. Mitscher
was for a while in command of air forces
on Guadalcanal; then came the Task
Force 58 assignment, with command of a
huge striking force of carriers and com-
bat vessels. In the reshuffle after the
surrender he was given the Atlantic com-
mand, from which a sudden heart attack
removed him last week,
Lewis Charles Wilcher, appointed head
of Gordon College, Khartoum, is a West-
ralian, was educated at Saint’s and
Adelaide Uni., and became Rhodes
Scholar for S.A. in 1930. After collecting
his B.A. and B. Lift, at Oxford, he
became Dean of Trinity College and
lecturer in History at Melbourne
Uni. He served with the Army Education
Service in Australia and New Guinea
during the war years, and was sent by
the Department of Post-War Reconstruc-
tion to Australia House, London. Now
39, he’s the son of Mrs. M. M. Wilcher,
former principal of the S.A. Women
Police.
Seven or eight years ago stories started
coming to The Bulletin over the name
of Olaf Ruhen. Some told of the Maori-
land gold diggings, others of fishing
boats, others again of a bush timber mill.
Later the Air Force crept into the yarns,
but whatever the theme there was in all
the stories a breath of authenticity, the
mark of the man who writes of things
whereof he knows. Last week Olaf Ruhen
dropped into The Bulletin office. He has
fossicked for gold; he has fished for a
living ; he has been a rouseabout in a
timber mill; he has flown bombers over
Germany. Ruhen was a lad of 19 when
the Depression came. Although a towns-
man, he didn’t take kindly to the dole
and relief work, and lit out for the bush.
When good times came again, with a
wealth of experience behind him he
turned to journalism with the Dunedin
“Star. War cut into that career. After a
spell in Canada with the Empire Training
Scheme he was put to training bomb-
aimers in Britain, but when the end came
he was half way through a Bomber Com-
mand Grand Tour of Europe, including
the only raid on Berchtesgaden—it -was
in the last week of dying Nazi Germany ;
Hitler’s Berghof was hit, but the Fiihrer
was winding up his affairs in Berlin—and
the last R.A.F. raid of the war, on Heligo-
land After demobbing, Ruhen went back
to the “Star,” but is now in Sydney to
try his luck on bigger, if not better,
papers,

thing about the family that attracts the

An unusual cleric is Monsignor Luigi
Ligutti, executive secretary of the
National Catholic Rural Life Conference,
who has arrived in Melbourne. His
ministry was Granger, a small mining
town in lowa which was feeling the pinch
of the great depression. Monsignor
Ligutti became famous overnight by tak-
ing 50 families living in the .lowest stage
of social degradation and establishing
them on farms on a co-operative basis,
each with its own fertile acres and with
every modern facility for farming. The
movement was sponsored by President
Roosevelt and his wife and grew to
nation-wide importance. Monsignor
Ligutti is here to study co-operative
schemes in Australia.
A. J, Anderson, Queensland’s first
Transport Commissioner under the new
Act, has had a wealth of adminis-
trative experience. Ten years after
joining the Main Roads Commis-
sion in 1923 he was placed in
charge of the registration branch, be-
came Registrar of Vehicles in 1939 and
later a member of the committee which
planned and instituted the State Medical
Research Advisory Council. In 1942 he
was chosen as managing-secretary of the
Brisbane and South Coast Hospitals
Board, in which capacity he did a fine
reorganising job. But the best tribute
to his worth is that Queensland transport
interests welcome the new appointment.
Robert Gillman Allen Jackson, senior
Deputy Director-General of U.N.R.R.A,,
touched down in Sydney for a brief visit
on his way to China, where, with other
U.N.R.R.A. officials, he will make a
survey of relief operations in the famine
areas. Born in Melbourne 35 years ago,
Jackson joined the R.A.N. in 1929 as a
paymaster-cadet. In 1937 he was trans-
ferred to the Naval Staff in Malta and
when war hit the Mediterranean and the
long travail of the George Cross Island
began he got his opportunity to show his
bent for organisation of supply. An
appointment in Cairo looking after the
Middle East Supply Centre —it controlled
all civilian supplies—followed, and when
U.N.R.R.A. was set up he was a natural
for his present job. Jackson’s head-
quarters are in Washington. A little
over a year ago he was summoned to
testify before the Congressional Com-
mittee—the first non-American to do so
—and it was largely through his efforts
that additional financial aid was extended
tralia. As Professor of Physics at
Adelaide ’Varsity since 1911 he has
launched a long string of students on
successful scientific careers. There are
Kerr Grant men in every State and in
countries overseas. Marcus Oliphant, of
atom-bomb fame, is one —K.G. demon-
strated atom-splitting experiments to him
20 years ago ; Howard Florey, knighted
for his work on penicillin, is another,
and a third is E. T. Both, inventor of the
Nuffield iron lung and the Both electro-
cardiograph. Hugh Cairns, Nuffield Pro-
fessor of Surgery at Oxford, another
Adelaide man knightgd for scientific
achievement, also heard his first physics
lectures from the wiry professor whdse
own well-earned knighthood came to him
in the last New Year Honors list. Out-
side lecture hours the prof, has done a
little inventing on his own account. He
is co-inventor of the Steele-Grant micro-
balance, sensitive to the extent of one-
millionth of a milligram, which should
be fine enough to satisfy an Aberdeen
grocer.
Friend of many Australian students
and book searchers in London, Evans
Lewin has retired at the age of 70 from
the post of librarian of the Royal Empire
Society headquarters in Northumberland-
avenqe. In 36 years there he saw it grow
from 40,000 to 250,000 volumes and
pamphlets. The whole of an Empire Law
Library, consisting of 35,000 volumes, was
destroyed in the blitz. Just before retire-
ment Lewin prepared a book entitled,

Dr. A. Fryberg, newly-appointed
Director-General of Health and Medical
Services for Queensland, had the strange
experience of having to learn to write
seine years after taking his medical de-
gree. The need came about as a result
of losing his right hand in a car accident,
and he combined the acquiring of a
new style of penmanship with a post-
graduate course in public health and
tropical hygiene at the Sydney Uni. Join-
ing the A.I.F. early in World War 11, he
has a distinguished record of overseas ser-
vice with the Eighth and Ninth Divisions,
and was one of the Rats of Tobruk. Re-
turning to the State Health Department
in 1945, he was sent to Britain and
America last year, in company with Dr.
Stubbs-Brown, to report on treatment
measures for infantile paralysis.

Heth, who had a rough passage since
his subject and Ted Scorfield (an old
English international) were deep in the
mysteries of Rugby Union football (with
appropriate gestures) during the seance.

teams against N.S.W., England, N.Z. All
Blacks and Maoris during four years
ending in 1928, when he became adver-
tising manager of Ford Motors. Broad-
casting acquired him in 1934 and he be-
came advertising manager of the Mac-
quarie Network in 1938 and assistant
general manager in 1944. He is a quiet,

life would consist entirely of (foreign

Women's Letters
From Sydney
The Duchess of Gloucester and the
Princes had pleasant, if not ostentatious,
quarters in the. Rangitiki, which sailed
last week for England. The first-
class drawing-room on the promen-
ade deck, carpeted and curtained
in beige, and the chairs and couches
covered in cream-flowercd chintz, was
reserved for the Duchess. H.R.H.’s
stateroom had walnut panelling, with
which the writing desk and dressing table
toned. Its deep sapphire-blue curtains
were patterned in gold, and its lounge
chairs were upholstered in the same shade
of blue. The two little Princes are sharing
a stateroom on the port side of the ship.
Travelling with the Duchess are Miss
Eileen Phipps, lady-in-waiting, Major
Michael Hawkins, A.D.C., and Mrs.
Hawkins, Chief of Staff General C.
H. Miller, Mrs. Miller and daughter
Elspeth, Comptroller of the Household
Commander A. W. P. Robertson, Dr.
Lorimer Dods and Mrs. Dods and other
members of the household. Dr. Lorimer
Dods is a children’s specialist.
The Rangitiki, gay with flags and bunt-
ing, was a brave sight sailing down the
harbor on Thursday evening. Ferries
blew their whistles in farewell, and
passengers going home to the different
bays rushed to the sides of the small
craft to wave good-bye to the outward-
bound Duchess and the Princes. Ad-
miralty House and Kirribilli Point were
thronged with Sydney friends of the
royal lady. The Rangitiki must have
carried tons of Australian flowers away
with her. All day there had been flowers,
flowers and more flowers for the Duchess,
and every passenger on the ship had had
them sent by friends left behind. The
Duchess took part in the streamer-throw-
ing which is so much a part of every
ship’s departure from these shores. Act-
ing Governor-General Sir Winstoit Dugan
and Lady Dugan, the Governor and Mrs.
Northcott, N.S.W. Premier McGirr and
Mrs. McGirr, Sydney’s Lord Mayor Bart-
ley and his wife were official importants
farewelling H.R.H. With her dove-grey
silk frock the Duchess wore a wide-
brimmed white straw hat bunched with
flannel flowers. At her waist she wore
a bunch of the same flowers.
By now Mary Churchill has become
the wife of Captain Christopher Soames.
Mary is the youngest of Winston
Churchill’s daughters, and next to her
magnificent father is the one of the family
who has captured the imagination of the
Empire. Her pictures show a gaze as
steadfast as her father’s will to conquer
the perils of the war years. If the good
wishes of women in every corner of the
world can bring happiness then Mary’s
whole life should be cast in sunshine.
The wife of the State’s new Premier
James McGirr is a slender, brown-eyed
woman with a soft-speaking voice and a
decided outlook on the part the home and
family life have on the development of
child character. She is the mother of
three children ; one small girl, two young
boys. She is very knowledgable, too, in
the methods of education. Her father was
a N.S.W. High School teacher for many
years. As a small girl Mrs. McGirr lived
in Orange and other country towns, so
she knows that angle of life, too. Her
only brother is a planter in New Guinea.
The whole McGirr clan might come under
the term “the happy McGirrs.” As a
family they have great zest for life. When
the new Premier told his brother Greg,
himself a one-time runner-up for State
Premier, the result of the voting Greg re-
plied : “Well, you won by two votes; I
was defeated by two, so you’ve evened up
the slate for me.” The new Premier’s
home is in Strathfield.
Moonshine and moonbeams are the in-
gredients that make the play now having
a one-week run at the Theatre Royal.
The moonshine (or at any rate strong
liquor) is responsible for the shooting, 50
years before the First World War, of
as pretty a bride as you could see. And
on nights steeped in the white magic of
moonbeams the lady revisits her bride-
groom-to-be, he having remained a con-
firmed bachelor, “Smilin’ Thru,” which
has been a very successful film, drew
crowds of old and new admirers to the
opening last Saturday. Mrs. A. E. Grace,
in a frock of deep Gobelin blue, a per-
sistent first-nighter, was among the appre-
ciative. Leading man Ken Fraser’s
mother had come from Adelaide to see
her son; the wife of producer Robert
Quentin was another keen follower of the
show. Bettina Welsh uses a brogue you
could cut with a knife as Kathleen Dun-
gannon, but is all cobweb charm as the
ghost of the ill-fated bride.
Viscount Bledisloe and his fair-haired
syife had all too short a stay in Sydney.
Much of Lord Bledisloe’s time here was
naturally taken up with Royal Agricul-
tural Society affairs, as the one-time
Governor-General of Enzed is now presi-
dent of the R.A.S. of Great Britain. He
made speech at the R.A.S. reception to
him, and at the lunch given in his and
his viscountess’s honor by the Royal
Empire Society. His voice has a
pleasant inflection, and his vowels and
consonants are crisp and disciplined, as
is the English way. His speech at the
Royal Empire Society stressed food-
food for Britain and the ability of this
land of ours to become the larder of the
world.
A good point made by Dr. F. A.
Maguire, who gave the speech in reply
at the R.E.S. lunch, was that “the world
was in need not of a forty-hour week
but of a forty-hour day to catch up with
the time stolen from us by the war years.’
President of the R.E.S. Colonel Spain
and his small wife, whose frock was of
thin black sheer, made friendly host and
hostess. Lady Bledisloe wore a soft
white crepe frock and a large white up-
turned felt hat to greet the warm day.
The frock had its square yoke outlined
in narrow rows of lace. Lord and Lady
Bledisloe flew off to Brisbane after the
lunch on Wednesday on yet another hop
of his goodwill mission. While they were
in this State they were the guests of the
Governor and Mrs, Northcott at Sutton
Forest.
Between two servings of “Burlington
Bertie” at the Tivoli, Ella Shields, trig
and dainty in white, her fair hair sleeked
to her well-shaped head, was the guest
last Thursday of deputy-president of the
Lyceum Club, Mrs. A. G. Thomas. The
hour was sherry time, and the clubrooms,
bright with gladioli, had all the windows
flung wide gasping-in the coolness of
twilight. The club’s president, Mrs. Met-
calfe, was at the party ; so was Dame
Mary Gilmore, as well as members of
the council. Ella, who has travelled all
lands and seen shows in all languages,
has nothing but praise for the Little
Theatre productions in Sydney. In par-
ticular she mentioned Doris Fitton’s In-
dependents’ presentation of “Six Charac-
ters in Search of an Author” and an
Academy of Dramatic Art presentation
of Priestley’s “They Came to a City.”
Mrs. E. R. Murray, of Beaconsfield
Station, Longreach, Queensland, holi-
daying in Sydney, finds it easier
to write amid the deep quiet of the
country than with the whirl of the city
round her. A book of her poems has
recently been published in London. It
takes its title, Song of the Road, from the
opening set of verses. In addition Mrs.
Murray has had many stories, articles and
poems published in Australian papers,
and is known to both Bulletin and
“Woman’s Mirror” readers. She has one
unique experience. When “Country Life”
offered a prize for a poem, and one for
the menu of a cold Christmas dinner,
Mrs. Murray sent in entries for both, and
plucked both prizes.
As this Letter was being popped into
the press the Kindergarten Union of this
State was inducting the first Younger Set
in its history into office. Rosemont, the
pleasant Woollahra home of president
Charles Lloyd Jones, was the setting. Mr.
Jones was in the chair for the opening of
the meeting, then he handed over to the
girls. Many of these 35 bright-faced ones
are daughters of mothers who have
worked for the kindergarten movement
for many years. A tea-party, all puffed
up with irresistible goodies, followed the
election of officers. Mrs. Charles Lloyd
Jones presided at this part of the func-
tion. Her pale-pink frock had the right
suggestion for the February day —it was
patterned in widespread fans and gay sun-
shades.
From Melbourne
Pursuing her fixed determination to get
the £250,000 she deems necessary for
the Queen Victoria Hospital, Norman
Brookes’s lady, who is its energetic presi-
dent, hostessed a gift afternoon at
Kurneh, South Yarra. The many lovely
gifts brought by guests will help stock
the fancy stall which the general com-
mittee of the Hospital Jubilee Building
Appeal will have at the Auxiliaries Fair, to
be held at the Town Hall on February 24.
At the party the president announced
that already £60,440 was in hand towards
the objective. When Viscount Bruce was
in Melbourne he handed to the Lord
Mayor a valuable cigarette-case owned
by Melba, and inscribed with the names of
many famous singers, and asked the Lord
Mayor to donate it to a worthy cause.
As the Lord Mayor could think of no
more worthy one than the Q.V. Hospital
Appeal, he passed it on. A racing colt
has also been given by Mr. A. G.
Hunter, and a house and grounds donated
by Mr. Norman Myer and Mr. Spencer
Jackson will also help the appeal. The
president was assisted by her daughters,
Lady Gengoult Smith and Mrs. John
Langley, the latter hatless and wearing
a pastel-blue linen frock. Many of the
guests were hatless ; among them Lady
Robinson, Mrs. Lennox Speirs, Mrs.
Denis Doxford, cool in white, and Paddy
Wilkinson, who chose a pastel-pink
chiffon frock. The hostess herself was
smart in a frock of pale-blue-and-mauve-
patterned linen, made with a boat-shaped
neckline and a sunray-pleated skirt.
The bright, alert face looking at you
here is that of Mrs. B. F. Tompkins, wife
of the U.S.A, Naval Attache. Mrs.
Tompkins, who was born in Hawaii,
where her father was a sugar-planter,
was educated in U.S.A, and then went
to live in the Philippines. Her travels
since her marriage have taken her to
Washington, to California anfl then to
Melbourne. Captain and Mrs. Tompkins
have one daughter, 12-years-old Carol.
Mrs. Tompkins, who likes Australia very
much, is fond of racing and all out-door
sports.
For the short revival season of ballet
at His Majesty’s the gala atmosphere was
missing. Many in the audience favored
the short cocktail frock and small hats.
Among the devotees of the formal was
Mrs. H. Ochiltree, wife of Major H.
Ochiltree, whose frock of white crepe
with a black polka dot was made with a
full-flowing skirt and tight-fitting bodice,
supported with narrow straps of the
same material. Another smart group in
the foyer comprised Mr. and Mrs. Geoff
Brewer, her dinner-frock of sage-green
crepe girdled with deep-mauve and
sage-green satin ribbon. Mary Ward’s
dinner frock, embroidered in gold, was
of dusty-pink crepe. Mrs. Fred Gamble,
wife of Judge Gamble, was accompanied
by Ruth Tait, whose stunning evening-
coat of pink-and-blue-striped lame was
worn over a floral evening-gown. With
a party in the d.c. was Tara Barry, star
of “Gay Rosalinda”; her white crepe
dinner-frock had a full-flowing skirt
allied to a short-sleeved bodice. With
Inez Lillies, smart in black, was Min
Salier, whose long, slim black skirt was
slit at the centre seam from hemline
almost to her kpges; with it she wore a
‘Chinese-red crepe jacket.
Latest lass to be off to England is Judy
Street, who leaves soon in the Orion.
Judy is going with the Malcolm Mc-
Cormicks, whose objective is the Jersey
home of Malcolm’s parents, Sir Alex-
ander and Lady McCormick. Judy, who
has just left Frensham, will return to Mel-
bourne in about a year’s time to do the
Arts course at ’Varsity. She has some
talent with the brush and hopes to do
some painting on the trip.
Guest of honor at an afternoon-tea
given at her St. Kilda home by Mrs.
John Langley was Mrs, Ella Mosco-
vitch. She was the former Ella Bromley,
of Melbourne, who has just returned
from the U.S.A. Mrs. Moscovitch’s
cinnamon-brown frock featured the new
draped skirt; her small high-crowned
bowler hat was highlighted by swathes of
pale-beige veilings trimmed with gold
sequins. Mrs. S. Byer’s white linen suit
had all-white accessories. Mrs. C. Cur-
tain favored a green-and-white-polka-
dotted linen with a straw hat edged with
green and white. Mrs. F. Marr was in
grey and Maida Voigt in brown linen.
Baroness Van Aerssen, wife of the
retiring Netherlands Minister to Aus-
tralia, was farewelled at a party given in
the clubrooms by the president and mem-
bers of the Victoria League. The Baron
will leave shortly to take up his new
post as Ambassador to China, but the
Baroness and her children, Sophie, Anna,
Albrecht and Marnix, return to Holland
on the Repeat. Sophie will marry in
Holland ; Anna is engaged. With her
daughters, the Baroness was received by
Miss Mary Chomley, vice-president of
the Victoria League and chairman of the
club. Looking cool in a frock of aqua-
green sheer, with a white flower-trimmed
hat, the Baroness received a bouquet of
mauve-and-pink flowers. Lady Herring,
who had come from a service at St. Paul’s
for the opening of the law year, was in
navy blue with white accessories; Mrs.
H. M. Sheppard, treasurer of the club,
also chose navy with a broad white stripe,
and white accessories. Mrs. Cairns
Officer’s brown suit was worn with a
large brown hat massed in front with
green flowers. Mrs. Rupert Greene was in
black, her small hat being trimmed with
red roses. With the Hon. Mrs. Ronald
Douglas was her daughter Victoria.
British. Trade Commissioner H. F. Gurney
was a gallant squire of dames.
Adding further interest to the exhibi-
tion of Australian-made millinery to be
shown by the Victorian Wholesale
Millinery Manufacturers Association for
the Queen Victoria Hospital Appeal will
be the display of period furniture. The
show will be held in the Town Hail and
the furniture will be arranged around the
hall. It will include pieces of Louis XIV
to Louis XVI era. Also on display will
be furniture used by Napoleon while in
exile on St. Helena; this will be lent
by Lady Brookes, president of the Queen
Victoria Hospital. There will be a group
of Buhl pieces, a collection of Sevres
porcelain and a show of Oriental furni-
ture. The fashion show—Prelude to
Autumn —will begin with a gala night on
February 19, for which tickets will be
two guineas. The following two days
there will be two sessions daily ; at one
of each teen-agers and the very young
will see fashions designed for them.
Mannequins, who will display hats,
gowns'and furs, lent by leading fashion
houses, will include senior girls
chosen from 200 applicants and an equal
number of juniors to display the youthful
fashions. A colorful background for the
parade will be supplied by a garden
arrangement of artificial flowers made in
a Melbourne factory.
Not many brides can dispense with a
car and walk to the wedding ceremony,
but that’s what Joan Finn, younger
daughter of Mrs. Finn, Toorak-road,
Toorak, and the late Dr. C. N. Finn, did
when she was married to Capt. Geoffrey
Ryan, ArA.M.C., only son of Mr. H. P.
Ryan, Dawson-avenue, Elwood, and the
late Mrs. Ryan. Joan lives next door to
St. Peter’s Church, where the marriage
was celebrated by the Rev. Father W.
Ebsworth. The bride wore a gown of
white chiffon, fashioned on Grecian lines,
with a pearl-encrusted belt worn at the
waist of the very full skirt. Stephanotis
blooms held in place the finger-tip length
veil of tulle, and a marker of stephanotis
and gardenias was attached to her Prayer
Book. The attractive and unusual frocks
worn by the three bridesmaids —the
bride’s sister Paddy, the ’groom’s sister
Patricia, and Betty Jess —were made
in redingote style of white dimity, sprigged
with tiny flowers, and showed the front
panel of the bouffant white organdie
skirts. They wore chip-straw bonnets
and carried delphiniums in mauves, blues
and pinks to pick up the colors in their
frocks. . Dr. Carl De Gruchy was best
man and Capt. Winston Rickards and
Capt. Des Hoban, both of the A.A.M.C.,
were groomsmen. After the ceremony,
Mrs. Finn entertained guests at a recep-
tion at her home.

The figures are a testimony to the skill
of the management and the support,
financial and otherwise, of the big mining
cos. at the Barrier in building up an
industry which, in the days before World
War I, was in the hands of Germany and
German-controlled plants in Belgium.
After making a handsome contribution to
Australia’s industrial development during
the b*etween-wars period, and to the pro-
duction of munitions and equipirfcnt
during World War 11, the enterprising
management is now quickening and
widening the scope of the co.’s activities.
The ore is mined and milled at the
Barrier (N.S.W.) and at the co.’s own
rich deposits at Rosebery, on the west
coast of Tasmania, The zinc concentrates
are delivered to roasting plants at Port
Pirie, Birkenhead and Wallaroo (S.
Aus.), Cockle Creek (N.S.W-) and
Zeehan and Risdon (Tas.). After
roasting they become calcines; in
the process large quantities of sul-
phuric acid are produced, which is
used extensively in the superphosphate
trade and for a wide range of other in-
dustrial purposes. The calcines are sent
to the big zinc plant at Risdon, capacity
of which is now being increased to
95,000 tons p.a. Here they are
converted into spelter—the name
under which zinc goes to market —
nearly 40 p.c. of which is exported. From
the residues a wide range of important
revenue-producing by-products are ob-
tained. The co. also manufactures super-
phosphate on its own account at Risdon,
where a new contact-acid plant is in
course of construction for recovery of
sulphur, and plans for manufacture of
sulphate of ammonia and related ferti-
lisers are in hand.

Shipping irregularities interfered with
smooth delivery of calcines last term, and
zinc output (up 1119 tons) was 5000 tons
below plant capacity. In addition to the
items shown in the table the year’s pro-
duction included 33,631 tons (up 4690
tons) superphosphate, 15,671 tons (up
800 tons) sulphuric acid, 1427 tons zinc
dust, 379 tons o©pper residues, 128 tons
zinc sulphate and 14.4 tons cobalt
oxide.
The board figured the profit at
£381,537 (up £57,046), which is recon-
ciled with the figure in the introductory
table in this way:

The net addition to the depreciation re-

balance (£406,522, up £57,041) was 13.5
p.c. on the £3,000,000 capital (half of it
8 p.c, cumulative participating), compared
with 11.6, 10.5, 10.5, 12, 14, 17.3 and

The Australian equivalent for the Jan.,
1947, sterling figures for zinc and lead is
each. In the local market the price
is fixed at £A22 a ton, and has been
since Feb., 1940. This, the chairman
says, is substantially below cost of pro-
duction, which is still rising. The co.
is thus in the position .where increased
Australian sales of its main product
adversely affect financial results, an anom-
aly which the Government, which is re-
sponsible, should adjust.
Shortage of mine labor restricted pro-
duction at Rosebery, where the mill
treated 118,343 tops (down 5111 tons)
ore, assaying 18.92 p.c. zinc, for the fol-
lowing results:

The co., which ran into a sea of troubles
from the start, made encouraging head-
way under the stimulus of war-time
conditions, when output was both
standardised and assured of a ready
market at fixed prices under Govern-
ment contract. The further improvement
in the figures last term is heartening.
Contrary to general experience in the
trade, the co. suffered less from labor
shortage and absenteeism than in previ-
ous years, and output benefited. But
trading conditions were abnormal, and the
result, therefore, not altogether a reliable
guide to the future, Australia’s entire
output of textiles was snapped up by a
hungry civilian|market, partly starved of
suitings for over five years and reinforced
*by priority demands of demobilised ser-
vice personnel.
In these circumstances the co.’s gross
earnings (£92,198) stepped up £10,073.
Including an extra £6592 set aside for
the taxgatherer (£28,439), exes. (£61,904)
made off with £7438 of the gain. That
left the net result £2635 stronger at
£30,294, really the best showing yet; in
1940 and 1941 earnings bore little in the
way of taxation because of offsets on ac-
counts of previous losses. The £30,294
was 12.6 p.c. on capital as against 11.5,
8.3 and 11.7 p.c, for the three preceding
terms. The div. was kept at 9.23 p.c.
With the commendable aim of decen-
tralisation the co. set up in 1923, when
prices were inflated. An early drop in
prices and other troubles made prospects
look hopeless for a while. However, in-
ternal differences were patched up, and
£156,105 was lopped off capital in 1929.
On paper profits appeared in 1933, when
shareholders got their first div. (5 p.c.),
followed by 3f, 5, nil and 5 p.c. But in
1938 disclosure of successive overvalua-
tions of stock showed that the actual net
result of 10 years’ trading to the close of
accounts in 1938 was a loss averaging
£4BOO p.a. The facts absolved the board
from blame. In 1941 another cut
(£55,158) was made in capital, reducing
it to its present figure, £239,075 in 441,369
shares of 10s. lOd. each, thus making pay-
ment of a higher rate of dividend than
would be otherwise possible an easier
matter.
There is nothing to worry about in the
present state of the finances:

Stocks (up £12,599 last term) are now
valued independently as well as by the
manager, and an extensive system of
other internal checks has been devised.
When the books closed more or less
liquids exceeded outside liabilities, in-
cluding the tax reserve, by £160,883 (up
£6468).
Exactly what the future holds for the
business .is difficult to say. The medium-
grade worsteds in which the co.
specialises compare favorably with
similar grade articles on the market. But
when the present backlog of demand is
overtaken the co.’s competitive power
might be handicapped by heavy overhead,
owing to the position of the mills —
Albury, Orange and Goulburn. Much
will depend upon the condition of the
plant, which was worked hard during the
war, with little opportunity of obtaining
replacements.
The market sums up the risks by pric-
ing the scrip at 165., at which figure the
return is 6.2 p.c. so long as the 9.2 p.c.
div. continues, or 3.7 p.c. should the dis-
tribution drop to 5£ p.c. The cover is

Shareholders in this 47-year-old, which
specialises in manufacture and distribution
of all kinds of office requisites and com-
mercial stationery, have had a long run
of satisfactory returns. For 20 years
after the public became interested in
1910 divs. averaged 9.75 p.c. Slump was
ushered in with an empty basket in 1930,
but 4 p.c. was paid in 1931, and a point
was added in each of the next half-dozen
years, raising the rate to 10 p.c., at which
level it has remained steady for the last
decade.
Certainly share premiums have
taken a little of the gilt off the ginger-
bread, but the effect of this has been
partly offset by two bonus-scrip issues—
£l2,soo each in 1928 and 1945. At the
same time as the last gift, £25,000 of
fresh capital was gathered, and it brought
with it £6250 of share premiums. These
new cash issues have also been in the
nature of bonuses to shareholders, be-
cause of the high price at which the scrip
has stood in the market.

Debtors’ balances increased by £34,929,
stock by £16,151 and plant by £14,177.
Including shares in the subsidiary, Lam-
son Paragon (W.A.), Ltd., which also pays
10 p.c., the more or less liquid surplus
(£195,887) was £58,858 stronger than at
the previous balance.
The co. has factories in all the Aus-
tralian States except the Speck, where a
sales branch at Hobart looks after the
local market. The improvement in last
term’s gross earnings (£112,197) was
£13,041. After sending an extra £l3OB
to the staff fund (£2732), but allowing
£5OOO less for taxation (£15,000) and £146
less for depreciation (£8191), the net result
benefited by £2735 of 'the gain. The
£23,502 of profit was 12.5 p.c'. on capital,
compared witfi 13.8, 15.1, 14, 12, 13.1,
12.7 and 12.6 p.c. back to 1939.
In the market, which looks upon the
co. as a steady 10 p.c. proposition, the
price of the f.-p. pound shares shot up
from the old official ceiling of 455. 9d.
to 51s. 6d. under free trading conditions.
The return at 51s. 6d. is 3.8 p.c. on a
10 p.c. div. basis. Visibly the cover is
31s. in net tangibles.
In mid-lanuary the Black Jack,
Charters Towers (N.Q.), was reporting
rich ore on , a 3ft. seam 750 ft. below,
about 50 1 50 mineralised ore and crushing
dirt. A sample of the ore, showing no
free gold, assayed 13dz. to the ton. The
co. is now finding it a little easier to get

Meekatharra Sands Treatment and
Mining Co., NX., has been put off the
stocks in W.A, with a nominal capital
of £62,500 in 500,000 2s. 6d. shares, of
which 300,000 are offered, payable Is.
application and the balance as required.
The issue has been underwritten by Saw
and Reid, Perth brokers, at id. per share.
The idea is to treat by cyanidation 570,000
tons of tailings on the old Fenian Con-
sols and Fenian mines, one-time star pro-
ducers on the Meekatharra field (W.A.).
The owner is to take 6d. a ton royalty
on sands treated, and the vendor gets
£1250 cash, together with 5 p.c. of gross
proceeds of gold won after the co. has
netted Is. a. ton, and the right to take
up 50,000 shares at par. The sands have
been bored to average l,lsdwt, approx.
11s. a ton. Tests suggest an 83.4 p.c.
recovery, and costs are figured at 55.,
leaving a profit of 4s. a ton, or £114,000
in the aggregate. A 10,000- to 12,000-
ton-a-month treatment plant is to be in-
stalled. The co. is also taking a free
sampling option over the near-by water-
logged Islington Albert mine, at the
bottom level of which there is believed
to be 90ft. of s.6dwt. ore showing over
a width of 12ft. Water from the shaft
of this mine is to be used in treatment of
the sands. Consideration for the mine is
£4OOO cash on exercise of the option.

Mt. Magnet Gold Mines, Ltd., a
London-controlled Westralian co. which
ceased mining some time ago, lost £lB5
stg. (£llO3 the year before) for the 12
months to end March last. Debit balance
carried forward is now £129,556. Pre-
ferential dividends accruing to balancing
date amounted to £30,625, and it is un-
likely that shareholders will receive any
of it. Co. took a quantity of gold out
of its mine at Mt. Magnet, but was never
able to make ends meet. To its starting-
of-the-mill fizz banquet special trains
brought the Governor, politicians, specu-
lators, newspapermen and others. It
was a great day for the invited.

“O.B.”: Cessation of mining at Wiluna
means a serious shrinkage in Australian
production of arsenic. Of total Com-
monwealth qutput Wiluna contributed
nearly two-thirds. The extraction plant
there was owned and operated by the
Victor Leggo Co. of Victoria. Arsenic
from Wiluna was marketed in the Eastern
States at £26 to £29 a ton. Before in-
stalling a plant at Wiluna, the Leggo Co.
obtained a few hundred tons from an-
other Westralian mine—the Transvaal,
on the Yilgara field.

Colonial Sugar Co.’s subsidiary, Aus-
tralian Blue Asbestos Co., operating in
Hamersley Ranges (W.A,), has acquired
the . near-by holdings of the De Bernales-
financed Australian Blue Asbestos Fibre
Co. Official reports on Hamersley
asbestos have been good. The mineral
is claimed to be superior to other forms
in tensile strength, in electrical insulating
value, and in resistance to acids, alkalis
and sea water. The State Government
has promised financial assistance in
building a road from Hamersley to the
port at Roebourne, 200 miles away.

Operations of First Hit Gold Mine,
N.L., for the year to end October, 1946,
showed a net loss of £12,841. Since
it commenced mining at Menzies (W.A.)
in 1935, co. has produced bullion worth
£446,390. Working expenses have taken
£251,006, development £53,671 and
dividends £97,875. Lately underground
developments in the co.’s mine have not
been good, and the board says “it can-
not feel any great optimism concerning
substantial shoots being found.” It
recommends further testing on a limited
scale and the investigation of other
properties.
* * * *
London-controlled Nevoria Gold Co.
has raised additional capital running into
six figures to further develop auriferous
areas near Southern Cross (W.A.), and is
now awaiting U.K. Treasury approval to
transfer the new money to Perth. There
are said to be 300,000 tons of payable
ore opened up, but practical miners
doubt whether average grade of the gold
carrier is good enough to show anything
worth mentioning in the way of profit
with costs as they are.
* ‘ # * *
Blue Spec Gold Mines, Ltd., has com-
pleted its option with the vendor of the
Blue Spec blocks, near Nullagine (W.A.),
and has accepted the Commonwealth
Government offer to provide additional
capital up to £42,000. This offer pro-
vides for (1) exercise of the option and
appointment of a general manager, and
(2) repayment of £160,000 already
advanced on the basis of half thb profits
from production. A mining man on the
spot reckons that prospects of the Com-
monwealth getting its money back are
not very bright.

SUNDRY SHOWS
LEGEND AND DOCUMENT.
There is much talk nowadays of
murals. This may be significant of a
great artistic quickening in our midst;
of a widespread demand; of dissatis-
faction with modern interiors ; or it may
be an indirect protest against high costs
of paint and labor anyone, without
belonging to a union, can decorate a
room, giving free play to his fancy with
scenes anywhere between the Bible and
Joyce’s Ulysses; and, with current
jumbled values in stand a good
chance of being hailed as a genius.
But, whatever the cause, an urge for
art or a general and contagious madness,
practically everyone is discovering poten-
tial mural painters, whether the artists
will or no. And looking at Elizabeth
Durack’s show of paintings of aboriginals
and aboriginal subjects at David Jones’
Art Gallery, I confess I was seized with
a desire to see her work —her “Legend”
for instance—gracing the walls of my
flat; where its bold red and blue and its
black children, warriors and rampant
monster, could hurl an effective challenge
at some of the peeling paint and huddled
roofs of East Sydney.
Elizabeth Durack’s work, in a sense,
is documentary. She seeks to tell some-
thing about the aboriginal, in varying
phases of his living. In this she is well-
qualified she comes from a famous
pioneering family, and in conjunction
with her sister Mary has had books
published by The Bulletin ( All-About
and Chunumd) drawn from observation
of her father’s properties in East Kim-
berley, W.A.
But a mural painter must have
strength, scope, vitality. All of these
qualities are possessed by Miss Durack,
in large measure. It is the lack of other
qualities, balancej construction, restraint;
not delicacy, precisely, since there is
evidence of this, but the technique neces-
sary to express it —which makes the
exhibition uneven, and much of the work
disappointing. But vigorous. Some of
the paintings burst with vitality.
“Legend” is large and long, a kind of
story in pictures, showing an old man of
the tribe re-creating for his child listeners
' the legend of the “Warragunna” a
monstrous bird-like creature. It is vivid
and spirited, the monster on top, the old
man squatting before a fire, smoke evok-
ing the scene, warriors, tracking, and the
children silhouetted.
“Rite of Increase” is of similar interest
—more appropriate for decor for ballet,
this, with a huge white-painted, white
head-dressed old man dancing in
frenzy, below him a tiny circle of
dancing figures.
Tire large “Landing of Dampier” is
grotesque strength, lacking the direction
of technique, missing the mark of ex-
pression ; and conventional. A dark-
outlined, conventionalised aboriginal
stands on a red hill, altogether too stark
for realism. Dampier lurks melodra-
matically in the foreground, a pistol be-
hind his blue coat, backed by a villain-
ous crew.
Where the painter becomes too earnest
about the story —and, perhaps, the social
aspects of the paintings—the work be-
comes curiously flat, and sometimes ugly.
“Broome Today”, for instance, designed
on the same style as “Legend,” shows
squalid buildings and harsh colors, is
crude and cartoon-like. “Old Woman”
is chiefly remarkable for claw-like hands,
“Children of the Holy Child Orphanage”
is bald and so on. On the other hand,
there are some fine —albeit fleeting —
studies of character.
With so much promise and so much
vitality, a good deal more may very
reasonably be expected.
J. F.
Divers Influences.
It is, perhaps, fanciful to explain the
geometric rigidity of some of Vincent
Brown’s oils, watercolors and lithographs
on view at the Macquarie Galleries by
the fact that the artists’ parents came
from Yugoslavia. This is Vincent
Brown’s first Sydney exhibition, but he
has exhibited in his birthplace, Brisbane,
and in Melbourne ; he has been abroad
and studied under Schwabe, McNab and
Komisarjefski, and he has designed decor
with Allied Theatrical Units during the
war. Still, looking at the lithographs
“Madonna del Lago” and “Toilet,” even
more than is the case with the oils
“Refugees” and “Sarajevo,” the mind
leaps to the stiff, bright, Byzantine decor-
ations seen around Belgrade and Nish.
Yugoslavia made contact with Greece
not through the golden spark of ancient
Greek culture but through the Cyrillic
alphabet and the patriarchs of the Ortho-
dox church; again, there was the dead
hand of Turkish convention in the south
—towns like Skopiye still have more
mosques than churches —and from the
west came the Latin influence: in her art
this mixture stimulated an occasional
fluorescence, but in the main it is bright
and hard and barbiaric—and there is
something hard and barbaric and bright
about the work of Vincent Brown.
“Madonna del Lago,” of course, is sub-
dued ; and here there is an obvious
Italian influence —or the influence of
modern imitations of Italian primitivism.
But there is a kind of paralysed anima-
tion about the fishermen, raising their
hands in understandable but grotesque
surprise at their catch of Madonna and
child. M. and C., on the other hand, are
not at all put out at finding themselves in
the net, facing a curiously curved boat
and an odd set of fishermen. A feature
of this, and similar work, is the neat
quality of surprising lines; which has
something of the startlipg effect of hear-
ing a person express lunacies in a cul-
tured tone.
“Toilet” is a mixed dish. A stiff, bar-
baric background with a nude of plasti-
cine-like charms. And “Refugees,” with
its bright pattern of cubes and symbols
and a red idiot child, is more frankly
modem —there is something cultured, as
it were, in the crudity—but provocative
of the thought that modernism in its
cubistic form is after all, only a return to
the conventions one would expect from a
primitive— not a civilised—community.
“Alfresco Concert,” in red and gold, has
a fantastic but genuine blaze and sparkle,
and “Mulberry Tree Growing,” a
lithograph of a tangled, lopped and prob-
ably symbolical tree embroiled with a
leaning, conventionalised hut, was pur-
chased by the N.S.W. National Art Gal-
lery—in accordance with its present
policy of buying anything that might be
something or something that might be
anything.'
Cellini Celloni, one of the greatest
teachers of the Renaissance, advised his
pupils to select a master, attach themselves
to him and learn, so to speak, his accent.
Then when they had learnt all he had to
teach they might be able to express them-
selves in their own fashion ; but if they
went about picking up bits, first from
this master and then from that master,
they would end up by producing some-
thing quite fantastic. Students of the
National Gallery in Melbourne, judging
by the annual exhibition of their work in
the august precincts of the Print Gallery,
seem to be able to follow a variety of
masters without going outside the building,
and some don’t seem to be following any
master at all. K. Wigley, Anne Church
and others contribute pictures that
wouldn’t look out of place in a “con-
temporaries” exhibition. The influence
of the late Bernard Hall with his rigid
conventions is apparent in a lot of the
exhibits, but that gentleman would turn
in his grave if he saw J. Bergner’s
winning canvas in the still-life division
displaying a couple of fish,' a pair of
turnips and a lofty scorn of technical
considerations. The first prize for a head
from life was drawn by D. Green, appar-
ently with a ruler.

Philip Relf, an ex-p.o.w. who had the
whole issue at Changi and on the Burma-
Siam railway, has been showing work at
the Velasquez Galleries, Melbourne.
Eighteen years old when he enlisted, he
had only had a few months’ study at the
National’Gallery school —not necessarily
a bad thing. The best of Mr. Relf’s
pictures are those he worked up from
sketches made during his internment.
Some of his later work looks tired,
though there are some Melbourne street
scenes which show observation.
AT THE TALKIES.
“A Place of One’s Own” (Embassy) is
a reasonable adaptation of Osbert Sitwell’s
novel of the same name, and as an attempt
to put over a ghost story seriously suc-
ceeds admirably—while watching the film,
18 master butchers, two barbers and a
walking stick (all formerly completely
bald) each acquired a worthy thatch
which moved up from the back of the
neck. Although the ladies may not like
the idea of James Mason appearing
throughout the film as a gent, of 70, he
turns in even better acting than usual.
Of British make, the film proves that
sepulchral housekeepers and a corpse be-
hind every door are not necessary in-
gredients for a thriller. Margaret Lock-
wood, waking at the midnight hour, hears
music being played on the establishment’s
piano. She slowly walks downstairs (“Go
back, you fool!”) and enters the drawing-
room. There in the darkness, the piano
plays softly without any visible pianist.
Suddenly it stops. Its lid bangs down.
Something bumps into Miss Lockwood,
and the spook of a young lady deceased
some 40 years takes up residence in her
admirable chassis. Br-r-r.
* * * *
Now shining at the Prince Edward,
“Blue Skies” have much high-class
material for the bathroom warbler, all
written by Irving Berlin, and handled ex-
pertly by Bing. As offsider to Bob Hope,
Bing has proved his worth many times as
a capable comedian. “Blue Skies" is
the first film in which he has tried to
raise the laughs himself, and that he does
it well can be judged from the smiles
on the faces of the tigers as they leave
the theatre. Fred Astaire, as usual, does
totally impossible things with his feet.
* * * *
Britain’s J. Arthur Rank is no dud at
making pictures, and each of his produc-
tions shown here so far seems a little
better than the one ln his latest,
“I See a Dark Strariger” (Esquire), De-
borah Kerr plays the leading role of a
young colleen still thinking, just prior to
D-day, in terms of Cromwell having
pinned up one of her ancestors by his
ears. She failed on the medical for the
Irish Republican Army and haying pur-
chased a German-English dictionary,
turned up in England hoping to become
a Nazi spy, and found plenty of openings.
Miss Kerr’s acting, with that of every
other character in the film, was superb.
* * * *
At present there is promise of stoush
between the British Minister of Trade,
Sir Stafford Cripps, and Louis B. Mayer,
on the subject of whether London or
Hollywood produces the better type of
film. Adding up points recently won by
England with films like “Perfect
Strangers,” “Wicked Lady,” “A Place of
One’s Own” and “I see a Dark Stranger, ’
this scribe would crown Sir Stafford and
say that where Britain very rarely turns
out a poor film, Hollywood occasionally
makes a good one.

Are you a chemist?

cz:
f f I RE you a chemist?” may sound an idle question
to ask your neighbour. Yet in a sense each one
of us dabbles in chemistry every day of our lives.
If we bake, if we wash clothes, write a letter or take
a snapshot, even if we only flash an electric torch
or strike a match, we start a chemical process. The
strange truth is that most of us do these things,
without knowing what it is we are doing, or how
the things we do are made to happen. This
series is designed to show many of the common ways
in which we use chemicals and to explain how the
various processes work. It will also serve to remind
us of the debt we owe to the research and production
of the British chemical industry. On no
industry do we depend more for the
necessities, the conveniences and the
comforts of our daily lives.

REDMIĹ RUM.
fhe advantage of a tuning-up run in a race
was decisively shown in Attley’s easy victory
over Flight in the mile C. F. Orr Stakes
(w.f.a.) at Moonee Valley on Saturday. it
was a first-up effort for Flight, but Attley had
had an outing in the William Reid Stakes at
the Valley on January 25, and superior con-
dition told. Aftley was able to win by five
lengths, pulling up.
In the circumstances Flight ran quite a fair
race, and should soon forge ahead of Tranquil
Star’s record winnings for a mare., Attley con-
firmed the impression that at a mile or there-
abouts he is as good as anything in the
country. However, his next meeting with Flight
may not be so easy. Like Flight, Star Act
was also having a first-up run, and went par-
ticularly well, the mare cutting him out of
second money by only a head.
Two over from Adelaide, Spawater and
Chatspa, made some of the other Melbourne
form look only moderate. Spawater, an aged
Limond Lad gelding, successful at his last
start over the hurdles at Cheltenham, carried
the solid topweight burden of 11.10 and com-
fortably accounted for Azores and Priority in
the two-miles Laverton Hurdle. Chatspa, a
four-year-old Chatham horse wth good Adel-
aide form at round about a mile, carried second
topweight and defeated the 100-to-l chance
Ben Butler, the hot favorite Mahram and other
sprinters in the six-furlongs Marine Handicap
first divison. The St. Magnus four-year-old
mare Kind Link was far too solid for Delano,
Apropos and the rest in the second division.
Dhotrium added another win to sire Dhoti’s
remarkable record in the five-furlongs Electric
Handicap for two-year-olds. The Footmark
colt Royal Mark ran a good race to be a handy
second under topweight, and the Shakuni colt
Carnage was a very promising third. Nagation
gave them weight and a convincing beating in
the 10-furlongs Wyndham Handicap; Bronx
and Private Chat in the places. Canada was
half a length too good for Field Balloon and
Sigeum in the 13-furlongs Newport Welter.
Sigeum was again favorite; he should do better
in something a bit shorter.

With most of the best Sydney horsemen
compulsorily “resting,” and some of the others
perhaps rattled by the stipes’ blitz, a distinct
feature of the A.J.C. Randwick meeting on
Saturday was the very general shocking riding.
In nqarly every event the winning was about
99.9 per cent, horse and the fraction horse-
manship. On the other hand, though there
were no big fields, some of the defeated looked
to be taking part in a grand tour rather than
a horserace. Consequently form in most of
the events could prove highly misleading.
Two much more agreeable sights were the
trim-legged Brueghel filly Shading and the ffhe-
looking animal that the four-year-old Genetout
horse Columnist has developed into. Both are
chestnuts, the filly about as light-colored as they
make ’em, and Columnist a rich dark color.
Running fourth to the turn in the Colling-
wood Handicap for two-year-old fillies, Shad-
ing (E. Fordyce) came through the field with-
out trouble when they headed for home, to
win by three lengths from Sueanne and another
two lengths to Proudness.
Shading, who should be capable of winning
in the better-class autumn racing, covered the
5i furlongs 19 yards in 1.7 —three-quarters of
a second better time_J.han Sea Spartan (also
ridden by Fordyce) made in defeating Phar-
minda and Rabelais in the Ingleburn Handicap
for colts’and geldings. Rabelais, a Titan colt,
confirmed those who are superstitious about
them having four white feet; he had what
should have been a certain winning break
on the field, but failed to stick on. Still, he
should be able to win one soon. Sea Spartan
is a hard-looking brown colt by Sea Tonic,
likely to get a bit of distance. Pharminda, a
colt by Beaupartir, is only a tiny fellow, but
game enough.
In the saddling paddock Columnist was by
far the outstanding animal of the Glenfield
Handicap field. Topweight with 9.7, he had
very hard luck to be beaten half a head by
Earl Pentheus, to whom he was conceding no
less than 2st. 31b. Hitherto Earl Pentheus had
not won at more than six furlongs, but he
had been no mean performer at that distance.
Ridden by apprentice F. Walker, he just man-
aged to last out the seven, with Wellington a
handy third. Barnsley should have been a
lot closer; one to remember at a mile.
. Outside the two-year-olds, among which, of
course, it can often happen, maiden performers
fail so consistently to beat previous winners
that punters’ persistent faith in their being
able to do it is one of the curiosities of
racing. Saturday’s example was the backing
to short favoritism of Herbert River in the
10-furlongs Berala Encourage. As usually hap-
pens, he failed even to fill one of the places*
these going to the previous winners Pitt (A.
Ward), Paktong and Tattling. Paktong, too
much of a handful for his apprentice rider,
ran all over the straight.
Right Royal, who has been called any sort
of animal but a horse, turned out in his
sourest mood for the 12-furlongs February
Handicap, bucking part of his prelim, and
rearing at the barrier. No doubt that made
it a good deal easier for the promising three-
year-old Fresco colt Vigaro (B. Robards) to
land the money from The Tiger and Invictus.
The last-named should be something to bet
on at a slightly shorter distance on one of
the other tracks. Solidly backed aqd lumping
top weight of 9.9, the six-year-old Royal Step
hprse Royal Peer (G. Moore) hung on solidly
to defeat Tamaroa and Menelik in the mile
Welter.

It was a very sorry-looking Bernborough that
passed through Sydney on his way to America.
He may yet justify at the stud the £93,000
reputedly paid for him, but he’s not the mag-
nificent bay-and-black animal that seemed to
dominate any field he moved in during his later
racing days.

Going on his win in the Armidale Cup,
Golden Empire wouldn’t have much trouble
winning in present Sydney company. Queens-
land-bred, a five-year-old Hebrus gelding,
Golden Empire led all the way over the seven
furlongs, equalled Rough Caste’s course record
of 1.251, and won by five lengths.

The remarkable suspension of N. Sellwood
and G. Moore, whose mounts were held to
have made a sandwich of Beau Brummell at
Moorefield, had just as remarkable a sequel.
“For goodness' sake be careful with my hair-do, Myra."
Moore intended accepting suspension, but when
Sellwood appealed he thought he might as
well be in it, too. And the AJ.C. upheld
Moore’s appeal, but let Sellwood’s suspension
stand. What helps to make bqth suspensions
and sequel remarkable is that the trouble hap-
pened in clear view in the straight, Sellwpod
riding Herbert River on the inside and Moore
riding Tamasha on the outside, with Beau
Bmmmell packed between them.

With the leading N.Z. stayer Golden Souvenir
and easy Melbourne Cup winner Russia at
the top of the weights—9.l2 each —the field
for the 1947 Australian Cup, run on March
8, could be one of the best for years. There
are plenty of other fairly competent stayers
weighted, and enough of them should remain
in to prevent it from being the flat race for
hurdlers it often has been. Knockarlow (8.5)
and Cherie Marie (7.13) look fairly well in it.
The Newmarket —first leg of the double; March
I—-has Attley weighted at 9.12, only lib. less
than Bernborough just won with last year.
Five Melbourne performers and the New Zea-
lander Da Vinci are weighted above Victory
Lad, the highest Sydney entrant. Cragsman
(8.11), Reperio (8.10) and Chisel Beach (8.0)
look nicely treated.

C. A. Haigh’s Balcrest stud at Balhannah

A solid sort of jumping record has been put

Fourth Test:
There’s no doubt Test cricket has become
a quaint business.
The match which ended last Thursday at
Adelaide Cricket Ground had started on the
previous Friday. For the six days of play the
cricketers and the crowds watching what pur-
ported to be a game sweltered through grilling
heat.
Not mere dozens but actually scores of re-
porters, commentators and the like of the
Australian and British press, along with broad-
casters in chattering relays, described everything
they could observe happening on the field or
in the crowd; scribes doing their best in such
high endeavors as trying to get a row going
on the momentous question of whether Wash-
brook was out or merely repeating himself,
and broadcasters flattering such things as dead-
bat pats with a flow of adjectives that would
leave them in verbal bankruptcy if tomorrow
they were called on to describe Armageddon.
And after all this welter of dust and heat
the flat anticlimax of a draw!
One thing, of course, helps to save it all
from complete and abysrpal futility: it still
puts a certain amount of emphasis on in-
dividualism. Compton’s and Morris’s double
centuries were outstanding in this department.
There’s still something to be said even for
six days of Test “cricket” when it can bring
out the individual quality shown in Compton’s
side-saving second innings. It was a good
innings in any case, but made against odds
as it was it deserves" to be called one of the
best ever played. •
By the same yardstick—the staving off of
certain defeat —Evans’s preposterous record of
staying at the wicket for 95 minutes without
scoring had its own absurd merit.
England scored 460 in the first innings and
340 for 8 wickets (declared) in the second ;
Australia, 487 and 1 for 215. It would be nice
to add that a good time was had by all;
but this is Test cricket, not to be’ thought of
with such flippancy.
To the end of the fourth Test three Aus-
tralians had topped the thousand mark in
first-class matches for the season: Miller (1139,
av. 81.35), Hassett (1016, av.. 67.73), and
Morris (1003, av. 83.58).
The “gate” bulged appreciably at the fourth
Test; £18,531 for the six days (a “best” for
Adelaide). Attendance (135,850) was, however,
below that of 1932-33 (174,452) and 1936-37
(172,016).
Arthur Morris, who can be called the “find”
of the season, and who was 25 on Jan. 19,
started in big cricket at 18 and scored a century
in each innjngs on his first inter-State appear-
ance for N.S.W. i
* * * *
W.A. players did quite well enough against
the M.C.C. to justify the extension of Sheffield
Shield play to that State. They’ll be in it
next season, and for a start will travel for
two matches and play two at home, the Shield
being decided on percentages instead of points.
It’s to be tried out for two seasons.

Young Victorian swimmer John Mar-
shall clinched his claim to represent at
the London Olympic Games by a very
easy win in the 1650 yards freestyle
championship of Australia, capped by a
record-breaking win in the 880 yards title
event. It made his fourth Australian title
in the Adelaide championships. But it
suggests they may be overdoing it with
this 16-year-old lad.
Only Canada and Australia entered for
the Davis Cup challenge round in the
American zone, winners to play the
European zone winners, and victors in
that to meet U.S. Maoriland is having a
shot at the European section, and has
drawn against Norway. They’re pretty
well all in it in Europe, even to Luxem-
bourg, Spain and Monaco ; Egypt is in
it, too!
* * * *
Royal, and Ancient St. Andrews, pre-
paring for this year’s Walker Cup match
(British amateur golfers v. American
ditto), is up against a nice sort of ques-
tion—whether James Bruen, the Irish
golfer who holds the British amateur
championship, and who led the victorious
British Walker Cup side at St. Andrews
in 1938, is eligible. Though born in
Northern Ireland he now resides in Eire.
The question is whether he’s still British.
* * * *
Jack Kramer had a bright word for this
part of the world when he got back
home; “We had a great trip to Australia,
I mean beyond winning back the Cup.
We had never seen such hospitality.
There’s a great sporting country, no mat-
ter what the sport. They are great
people.” Outside Bromwich, Kramer
wasn’t sure of any new Australian tennis
stars coming on, “unless Dinny Pails im-
proves considerably.” Still, “they’ll get
some others pretty soon. The long war
stretch held them back.”
* * * *
Joe Grant showed no relish for
facing up tp George Sands (10.6) at
Leichhardt, though in a previous en-
counter at Newcastle Joe had easily out-
pointed that member of the Sands glove-
and-grit brotherhood. This time Joe kept
on the retreat and Sands kept on slugging.
Points victory for George; smelling-salts
for Joe,

Maorilander George Allen (11.12|)
beat Victorian heavyweight Jack Marr
(12.4) at Melbourne Stadium on what
could be called a hock k.o. Marr, who
seemed to be going all right till then,
came out for the eighth round limping
and in apparent pain from a hoof injury,
and ref. Jennings closed proceedings.

Complimenting it with the name of a
fight, the meeting of Tommy Burns and
Hockey Bennell at Sydney Stadium can
go on record as one of the worst in his-
tory. Over in four rounds, it established
Burns as Australian welter champion
and decided Bennell to turn the game in.
Hockey.now admits to being 33, having
put on five years since the match was
made.

BRITISH INDUSTRIES FAIR
LONDON AND BIRMINGHAM, MAY sth- 16th. 1947
This is your first opportunity in seven years to
see your old suppliers in Britain and to meet new ones.
Overseas Buyers are invited to Britain for the
1947 British Industries Fair. It will enable them to
establish personal contact with the makers of the
immense range of United Kingdom goods displayed
in the London (Lighter Industries) and Birmingham
(Hardware & Engineering) Sections of the Fair. The
careful grouping of exhibits will assist buyers to
compare the products of competing firms with a
minimum of time, trouble and expense. Special
arrangements to suit individual markets can be dis-
cussed and terms and conditions of business settled
direct with the manufacturer, since only the actual
producer or the sole selling agent may exhibit.
For full details of the 1947 Fair apply to the nearest British
Commercial Diplomatic Officer or Consular Officer, or the
British Trade Commissioner in your area.

Talk of Depression.
The United States Ambassador to Aus-
tralia, Mr. Robert Butler, has been re-
ported as saying that, in his belief, an-
other major depression did not have to
occur. Mr. Butler .was an appropriate
person to make such a statement because
it is in America that conditions most
conducive to a depression now exist.
Most people, indeed, expect a temporary
setback in prices in the U.S.A., but in
that country, as elsewhere, the position
generally is one of unsatisfied consumer
demand, especially so far, as housing is
concerned. And this “backlog” of poten-
tial building activity alone indicates that
wage-earners themselves hold the key—
or possibly their militant or Communist
union bosses hold the key—to the ques-
tion of whether we are to have another
major depression or not. If wage-earners
are ready to do a fair day’s work for
fair pay prospects of steady employment
are .bright indeed.
Certainly present world production
deficiency put back into a 1939 setting
would be far from indicative of a de-
pression, Everything would be sugges-
tive of a boom, rather. It is Government
politics and trade-union politics more
than anything else that are causing doubts
to be cast on immediate industrial and
financial stability. Socialistically-minded
Governments in Australia are taking too
much in the way of taxation from all in
order to give cradle-to-grave “social
security” to a section, while trade-
unionists, principal recipients of this
“security,” are not backing up the Gov-
ernment “security” lOU’s with actual
production. Financial arrangements not
backed up by real value are a treacher-
ous and are capable of creating
that inflation and confusion which leads
eventually to the collapse of confidence.
The general concept of a depression is
a state of affairs in which there is
“too much production, 1 ” prices fall.
goods become hard to sell, people are put
out of work and financial confidence dis-
appears. We are indeed a long way from
anything like that pow. The usual cry
during the conventional depression is that
there is overproduction—during the last
big slump President Roosevelt ordered
the ploughing of crops back into the
ground, and restriction of production was
common in many parts of the world,
though not in Germany and Japan*
Present conditions in Australia, as a
whole, are suggestive of a production de-
pression more than anything else —a de-
pression arising from an inadequate sup-
ply of goods and services. Combined with
a weak Government industrial and finan-
cial policy this could lead to further price
inflation and credit expansion; but such
a phenomenon would still be unaccom-
panied by a boom output of goods, the
uspal forerunner of a slump. Positive
though it is that grave dangers are pre-
sent in the trade-union policy of starving
the country of essential production, it is
necessary to realise that we are not
threatened by a slump in the ordinary
sense. In other words, we should be fully
aware that bountiful production and
credit-control in present circumstances
will be our salvation, whereas it is often
necessary to curb output or expand credit
during a slump.
The comments of G. L. Schwartz, of
the London “Sunday Times,” were pub-
lished here a couple of months ago. Mr.
Schwartz was of the opinion that the
serious coal situation, the uncertainties of
the socialist policy and the strained
national finances in Britain were pre-
venting a boom there, not ending one.
The peace-time boom —a boom being the
usual precursor of a slump had not
ended because it had not begun. “As
well argue,” he said, “that the rise in
London property values since 1940 repre-
sents a real-estate boom which has run
its prescribed course and now heralds a
decline in building activity. Why, physi-
cally, the thing hasn’t even begun! ”
The United States has its own peculiar
problems to contend with. It has had
more price-inflation—a closer approach
to a boom - than either Australia or
Britain, partly because it entered the war
two years later and in that space of time
it felt all the stimulus of war-time pro-
duction demands without being com-
mitted to war’s costs, except to a com-
paratively small amount of lend-lease and
rearmament expenditure. It has paid
heavily, and passed through a variety
of economic and political emotions
since then, and it has abandoned
economic controls and checks more
rapidly than other Allied countries.
Speculative fever has run almost a full
cycle, and subsidence of this fevfer of
itself might give the country symptoms of
recession. But, though there may be a
number of painful readjustments among
certain sections following this fever, it
will simply amount to industrial anarchy
and stupidity if the United States or any
British country collapses* into an indus-
trial depression over the next five years.
Announcement of Woolworths’ new
issue, of one for four at par, attracted
considerable attention on ’Change last
week. The ss. old shares rose from under
28s. to 30s. 6d, in quick time. On the
present 12 p.c. div, basis the yield at an
ex-rights price of 255. 6d. becomes about
2.4 p.c. High war-time (company) tax is
the chief present drawback to concerns
Woolworths, and it will need to be
elirrhnated or greatly reduced before
many industrial shares will be really worth
more than five times par value to their
owners. Tooth (brewery), paying 13 p.c.
and priced at under four times par value,
has greater immediate attractions than
most chain-store scrip.
# * * *
A strong tone was evident on the share-
market generally last week, with a few
interesting exceptions—Bank of N. S.
Wales and Bradford Cotton being notice-
able. Bradford, cum div., offered the
attractive yield of 3.9 p.c. at 525. 3d.
B.H.P. rose again to 475., and in
spite of the present yield of no more than
3.2 p.c. offers big possibilities. Masonite,
to which attention was recently drawn
here, is in firm demand.
* * * *
Bank of N. S, Wales £2O shares, which
have ,been as high as £4l this year, were
on sale at £3B s§. last week. Net
\
tangible asset backing'’ per share, on
book values, was £34 16s. Id. last balance
.day. It may be safely assumed that the
properties of the bank are a great deal
more valuable than balance-sheet figures
suggest, and that the latest sharemarket
prices are well covered by asset values
alone. The dividend rate is 6\ p.c., and
the immediate yield offering £3 Bs. per
cent. Bank earnings are restricted by
Treasury control, and it is unlikely that
income from banking operations will rise
again to the Ifevels established prior to
1929. But rentals from premises, etc.,
should increase as time goes by, and, in
the event of nationalisation of the system
taking place, the High Court ruling that
compensation must be just in the case of
Government confiscation should ensure
a payment to shareholders in excess of
the present market price. Security and
yield are attractive Ayith the shares at
under £39.

The. Sydney sharemarket is awaiting
with interest results of drilling in the
Kariava borehole being put down by
Australasian Petroleum Pty., Ltd., in
Papua. The drill, down to over 6000 ft.
now, is rapidly getting on towards the
10,000 ft. that was mentioned as possible
in the early (pre-Jap-war) stages. Oil
Search, Ltd., has a fifth interest in the
project, and it is through Oil Search that
Australian investors come into the scene.
Even if this borehole is a dry one ex-
ploration on an intensive scale will still
go on, experts and more plant having
been brought from the U.S.A. recently.
Two more drilling outfits will be operat-
ing in September, and another £4,000,000
or £5,000,000 Will be spent, if necessary,
in order to “bring in” oil. Before the war
£1,250,000 was spent on exploration and
drilling. Oil Search ss. shares are avail-
able at about 6s. Id.

At the annual meeting last year of
Steamships Trading Co., Port Moresby,
chairman A. S. Fitch mentioned “the
heavy export tax now levied by Australia
on goods coming to Papua, amounting to
70 p.c, and 80 p.c. on some main lines,
such as flour, biscuits, wheatmeal, soap,
etc., on which, of Course, we have again
to pay duty on entering Papua.” Pro-
testing that inhabitants of Papua had to
bow to Australian controls over selling
prices of copra, rubber, etc.. Captain
Fitqh pointed out that they were treated
as foreigners in other respects. The “ex-
port tax,” etc., paid on imports will cer-
tainly astonish most people reading of it.

National Plans Wanted
Australia is badly in need of practical
planners at the present time. The
country was turned upside down socially
and industrially during the war, and a
political revolution has hgen in progress
since ; with conditions unsettled overseas,
the combination of changed and chang-
ing circumstances has been confusing
enough to discourage the making of long-
term plans by private industry, and on
the Government side the greater part of
any planning has been of a political—-
often socialistic—nature, sometimes con-
flicting with the aims of productive in-
dustry. Too often, also, Government
officials have been content to make
“plans” on the basis of money expendi-
ture only ; they have not fully considered
construction difficulties and reproductive
values.
It is impossible to design the life of a
nation in detail, and undesirable for the
State to plan it even in general • but it is
essential, in order to win for a people the
highest in the way of productivity and
living standards, that necessary public
works be considered carefully in relation
to popular demand and the requirements
of private enterprise.
Every section of our industrial life de-
pends on other sections, and greatest out-
put and prosperity follow expansion of
public and private services, factories, etc.,
in a manner that brings reciprocal benefits
to all. There should be a minimum of
competition and conflict so far as capital,
labor and materials are concerned in the
first place, and afterwards it is best that
the services planned should give a maxi-
mum in the way of variety rather than
duplication.
The biggest errors in planning are
likely to. occur in public works and simi-
lar projects. The profit incentive is not
such a controlling factor in Government
expenditures, and though many essen-
tial services would never have been
brought into existence if the profit motive
were the only motive in our life, there
are other services the profit-returning
possibilities of which are the indicator
of the people’s need.
Business enterprises at their best are
usually planned to meet a genuine public
demand, and are expanded in the
most economical manner. This means a
minimum consumption of manpower
and materials, and with things as they
are now such economy is to be desired.
So far as public-works programmes
are concerned there is the ever-present
political danger that jobs will be given
merely for the sake of maintaining em-
ployment. Thus a most careful arrange-
ment of public works is required, with
full co-ordination between all States and
the Commonwealth.
Where it is considered necessary for
Government works to be carried out it
is essential for a great deal of planning
to be done: this is really a proper pro-
vince for State planning. During the
closing stages of World War II the Co-
ordinator-General of Works expressed
astonishment at the inadequacy of post-
war “works” plans—and that was at a
time when Federal Departments were
babbling about “planning” and “full em-
ployment” almost in their sleep.
Governments, State and Federal, are
obviously lacking in plans for increasing
the national production and population-
carrying capacity. Mr. Ward talks about
his rail-gauge-standardisation “plans” as
though they were all-important. They are
really of minor value in the immediate
problems of the country. Restoration of
productivity and living conditions are of
far more present urgency.
With Governments, and particularly
the centralNsody, so uncertain in their
plans, private enterprise is also hesitant.
Heavy taxation is a restrictive factor so
far as industry is concerned, and the Gov-
ernment offers little in the way of resist-
ance to prevailing indiscipline in trade-
union ranks. There is always the threat
of socialistic interference, too, in cer-
tain industries,
Eet it be repeated that State-planning
in the detail of our lives is not a thing to
be suffered for a moment. But the
Federal Budget to begin with should be
designed in a way that will put the fewest
obstructions in the way of private pro-
ductive enterprise, while public works
should be planned to harmonise with
other enterprise and development and to
offer least competition for money, man-
power and materials required for other
essential services.
Notwithstanding restrictions said to
have been placed on exports of clothing,
which is short in Australia, exports of
piecegoods during the five months to
Nov. 30 last were valued at £2,069,000,
compared with £376,000 in the same
period of 1945 and £76,000 in 1938. Cor-
responding figures for “apparel and
attire” are £2,110,000, £1,180,000, and
£65,000 respectively. Altogether, exports
of textiles from Australia during the
latest five-months period were valued at
over £5,000,000. If that rate is main-
tained for a full year the industry will
be bringing in an overseas income almost
equal to a pre-war butter-export cheque.
It appears that export of a certain
quantity of Australian textiles, knitted as
well as woven, is being allowed in order
to make price-stabilisation easier—the
exporter gets a higher price for what he
sells overseas, which helps to keep down
the price inside Australia. It -may be
noted that a well-made pair of ready-to-
wear men’s slacks can be bought in the
Commonwealth for under 445., and that
first-class men’s shoes may be got at
525. 6d., which is very little above the
1939 price. The increase in lower-grade
products may be more, but, on the whole,
woollen clothing in Australia has been
kept at a reasonable level, except that
tailoring prices have soared because of
labor problems. Cottons and imported
textiles generally are disproportionately
dearer —but that is another story. Be-
cause of the depressed exchange rate and
more effective price-control Australian
textiles are in a position to compete with
the products of many parts of the world,
including the United States. There Aus-
tralian “woollens’! are very highly re-
garded indeed.
In Britain the duty on foreign wines
has risen from Bs, a gallon before the
war to 345., and on Empire wines from
4s. to 30s. Thus preference, which used
to amount to 50 p.c. in 1939, now scarcely
exists. As it turns out, at the present
time all Australian wine available in
Britain can be sold profitably regardless
of preference ; but this condition of things
may not always prevail. Consumption of
wine in Australia has almost doubled
during the war, and the demand is still
considerably in excess of' supply. It is
often noticeable that in price-categories
fixed at pre-war levels quality of wine
has dropped sopiewhat; but with larger
vintages now in prospect it may be that
quality generally will improve. There has
been a tendency for some winemakers to
hold back from sale stocks of wine that
will be the better for keeping in hopes
that in a year or two’s time taxation on
profits will have come down.
* * ♦ «
Scotch whisky is going to be scarce for
years to come. Present production is
greatly restricted by Britain’s shortage
of cereals, and there has been a big war-
time gap in the continuity of maturing
spirit. Scotch is matured for from five
to seven years. In pre-war days an aver-
age_of 29 million proof gallons was dis-
tilled annually. Less than 10 million
gallons was distilled in the first year of
the war, and after that, until 1944, there
was almost no production. For 1945-46
about 13 million gallons was put down.
Stocks of 150 million gallons in 1939
have declined to about 80 million now.
Sales in Britain have been reduced by
about 50 p.c, Overseas markets are far-
ing better in the distribution of supplies.
* * * $
A greater output by workers is the
crying demand of the whole world.
Never before has such a great responsi-
bility rested upon the plain people to
work out their own economic and poli-
tical salvation. Without production be-
ing restored to a reasonable level we shall
see the value of income and savings dis-
appear, social security vanish, employ-
ment become precarious and living stand-
ards cut far below what this state of
civilisation might reasonably expect. It
is out of production that we draw nearly
all of our material benefits.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Bo”: The new hand knew nothing
about fencing, so Mitchell spent the first
day with him, initiating him into the
mysteries of sinking posts and straining
wires. When he seemed to have the
hang of things Mitchell left him to it,
with a final emphatic injunction. “I want
to see a straight fence,” he said. “You’ve
got your boundary line marked out for
y’. Stick close to it. I don’t want it
wandering all over the place. Remember,
now, I want to see a straight fence!”
The next afternoon Mitchell looked up
from mending the utility to see the new
hand. “What, finished already?” he
asked. “Not quite,” replied the hand.
“Fact is, I’ve come in to see if y’ got
any holler logs around the joint.” “What
the hell do y’ want hollow logs for?”
asked the trump. “You’ve got plenty of
sound posts on the job, haven’t you?”
“Yairs,” said the hand, “but I’ll have to
have the holler logs to stand the posts
in, \von’t I? I’ll have to sink the logs
upright so the posts can rest in ’em an’
string the wires on to them, too. It’s
where that sharp dip is near the corner.
If I don’t fill in the hole the cattle’ll be
able to walk under the new fence, won’t
they?” The despairing Mitchell realised
then that the hand had taken his
“straight” order literally.
* * * *
“Old-timer”: Here, what’s the mean-
ing of this statement (B. 5/2 / ’47) that (in
regard to Commos) “Catholic ‘Labor’
politicians and union leaders in astonish-
ing numbers have shown no more fight
than there is in a frilled lizard”? I’ve
hobnobbed with a lot of frillies in my
time, and I never met one that
buck if anybody tried to sit on him. Ad-
mittedly, they’ll get out of a man’s way,
which is only wisdom considering the
discrepancy in size' and weapons, but they
won’t back down from their own kind
and from the lesser reptiles as do the
gentlemen referred to. A frilled lizard
will defend his home and his rights
against any comparable enemy, and I’m
dead sure that all the mouthings and
threats of all the “militants” in Australia
wouldn’t bluff any frilly out of his course.
I’m sorry you had to pick on the frilly
as an example, though I admit it must be
hard to find anything poor-spirited
enough to cite as such.

“X.E.D.”: The cove who blew into
the pub at Sapling Ridge weighed about
seven stone two with his hobnail boots
on, wore a rusted black moustache and
announced himself, rather apologetically,
as ready to do business sharpening razors.
An hour later he modestly admitted to
being the best razor-sharpener who’d
ever visited the district; in twice that
time he’d promoted himself by degrees
to the best soanso cutthroat-honer in the
whole country. Then, to prove his claim,
he produced a wickedly-sharp razor,
made a few reckless passes in the air
and began stropping it furiously on his
forearm. “Hey, go easy!” yelled Bung
in alarm. “We don’t want an accident
here.” The little cove eyed him solemnly
before sheathing the instrument. “Yairsh,”
he agreed. “Sh’pose if if shlipped an’
nicked me t’ the bone. Cripesh, it’d take
me hoursh t’ git an edgesh on it agen
like it’sh got now.”
* * * *
“Mat’s Mate”; Luigi Ruddone, wine-
grower, was a trifle dubious about giv-
ing us the contract to trellis a few acres
of his vines, largely because he supposed
we came from Melbourne, and he had a
hearty contempt for city blokes (he emi-
grated from Naples to Australia). How-
ever, we talked him round and got a
start. Mat was an artist in any kind of
fence, and I’m not too bad, so when Lui
saw our first two rows he went into
transports. “Ha, gooda name. My
bletty word, she is da gooda jorb!” he
chortled. At sundown that night he had
us up to his house and produced some
of his special vintage. By the time we’d,
sampled his sherry, sauterne and grappa
we had to be helped outside to sleep it
off. Next morning Ruddone was very
“Got Strawb. on the move at last."
sad. “Youa da good fellow, all right.
Gooda da worker, too, my bleeda da
oath. But aw, da weak head, da weak
head.” Mat reared up. “You blokes is
all the same,” he roared. “You start
suckin’ flamin’ plonk before y’re weaned
an’ y’ can take it like a cat lappin’ milk.
We ain’t wine-drinkers, see. We’re used
t’ beer.” Luigi put his old brown head
on one side and pondered. We repaired to
work. That night when we went to the
house he was all smiles and mystery.
“How you like him, eh?” hfc cried, and
there stood a dozen bottles of beer. “No,
no,” Mat howled. “We can’t drink an’
work too. After the job’s finished, yes.
Not now. We stick to tea now.” Dis-
tressed and puzzled, Lui put the beer
away. Next night he had waiting for us
one keroseije bucket full of tea. In the
end we compromised. Tea with break-
fast, grappa with lunch, beer in the even-
ing.' We always reckoned that was the
best job we ever had.

“Alpine Willie”; The camp cow, on
her annual pilgrimage to the nearest
neighbor’s grass paddock, is able to de-
moralise the jealous and antagonistic
heifers there with no more potent weapon
than the bell worn on her neck. The
flighty young things shape up, scrape at
the dirt and bellow violently ; whereupon
Baldy screws ’em off and shakes her
head. They go for their lives at the
melodious jangle.
* * * *
“Horseless Horseman”; Great Glennie,
a 400 ft.-high grassy-topped island four
miles west of Wilson’s Promontory, has
become infested with rats. Twenty years
ago the only visible inhabitants on the
two-miles-long mass of granite were
countless penguins and mutton-birds in
the huge rookeries there, besides hun-
dreds of Cape Barren geese, the most I’ve
ever seen in one spot. The place was
rarely visited, even by fishing boats, which
had to moor to ringbolts there in a rocky
gulch on the eastern side, until nine years
ago when Harry Crole, of San Remo,
established a crayfishing depot and —
carting everything from firewood to water
—lived on the windswept island for five
months. There .were a few rats then,
but, visiting the place a month or two
back, Harry reports the rodents so thick
that they come up anywhere and eat
dead mutton-birds while you are holding
them. Even the geese, which used to
puddle the only fresh-water soak on the
island to make it undrinkable, have de-
creased. They are ship’s rats, but there
hasn’t been a vessel wrecked there since
the Maoriland scow Curlew went ashore
during the first world brawl. Have the
intruders taken that long to breed up or
have they come ashore on wreckage?
* * * »
“Solitude”: Walked into the store, to
find Seventyfiver airing his opinion of
present-day prices. “Twenty-five bob f’r
a pair o’ pants that won’t last a flamin’
fortnight,” he growled, waving back the
garment. “An’ in the ol’ days, George,
moleskins was four and six an’ two pair a
year kept a man well dressed. Twenty-
fi—cripes, I won’t pay it; hanged if I
will.” He was still on the subject as we
turned out of town. “Dunno what the
world’s cornin’ to, Sol. Wants someb’dy
t’ take a firm stand agen them high
prices,” he declared, looking as dignified
as a hole in each knee and fringes round
his boot-tops would allow. “Stop buyin’,
that’s the way.” We rode on in silence
till I remembered a message. “Oh, Ted
Henderson wants to know if you’ll sell
those half-dozen lambs running round
your hut,” I told him. “Says he’ll give
you thirty-two bob, and that’s more ’n
double what you’d have got a couple of
years back.” The old bloke turned to
glare. “Wha-at!” he bawled. “Does he
think a man’s a flamin’' benefit s’ciety?
Y’ c’n tell the lousy skinflint ’e ain’t
gettin’ none o’ them lambs a penny under
two quid.”
* * * *
“Chookie”: It is easy to understand
why “Betcha’s” household-pet collie
baulked at entering its kennel when a
three-days-old chicken was perched op
the step (B. 15/1/’47). A puppy’s first
impulse on contacting young chickens is
to worry them, prior to indulging in a
tasty meal; and one of the first lessons
he learns around his owner’s fowlyards is
that such fluffy balls of succulence are
sacrosapct, the lesson being invariably
driven home by means of a stick. Thus a
good dog will starve sooner than touch a
chicken; he won’t even go near one for
fear of being blamed. The sight of a
dead one fills him with alarm. So
“Betcha’s” collie when it sat in the rain
sooner than dislodge that chicken wasn’t
afraid of it but of its possible death and
the dread consequences to himself.
* * * *
“B. A. Ker”; With the exception of
the mute evidence that a “sportsman”
with a gun has passed by I’ve rarely found
a dead bird in the bush —and I mean the
bush, not shadeless, scorching plains that
take a heavy toll of bird life. But the
sea appears to be merciless on her
feathered habitues. After a heavy storm
the flotsam swept to the beach rarely fails
to include a dead seabird. On occasions
I have counted up to half a dozen within
a hundred yards. Generally the carcasses
are of a black species about the size of
an ordinary gull; the feet are webbed
and the beak slightly hooked at the end.
As the common gull, which roosts on the
shore at night, is very seldom in the
list of casualties, I’ve formed the con-
clusion that the black variety camps on
the % water at night, and, being trapped
by a storm, finds itself unable to fly
against the gale or swim against the seas.
But would a waterbird drown, even in
a raging sea? And if it did, would a
drowned creature float? If the answer is
not in the affirmative in both cases, what
does kill the birds?
* * » •
“Salmon Gums”: “Zake’s” horse
which wouldn’t swim behind a rowing-
boat (B. 15/l/’47) is a strange creature
to me. Once augmented my wages by
hiring the services of self and boat to race-
horse trainers —my old river beach is still
known as “the horse-landing”—and of
the hundreds I’ve handled I’ve never met
a prad that wouldn’t swim once out of
its depth. They didn’t all take kindly to
the water at first, but my trouble with a
fractious steed was not to tow it but to
prevent it joining me in the boat. Most
four-footed beasts swim naturally. Be-
fore the construction of a jetty near Fre-
mantle the nor’-west cattle boats used to
stand off the coast and unload their cargo
into the ocean. Most of the cattle had
never previously beep submerged above
the knees, but once in the briny they
made unhesitatingly for land. The main
casualties, apart from some caused by
sharks, occurred amongst those which
turned their backs on Australia and
headed for parts unknown.
* * * *
“Frank Mauri”: Here’s how»to eat
mangoes without all “Colonel Bung-
starter’s” crockery (B. 22/1/’47). Cut
two rings round the fruit, each about an
inch from the ends. Peel the skin off
between the rings and, holding the mango
by the ends, strip the pulp from the stone
with the teeth. You don’t need the bath,
and, by holding the little fingers crooked
at elegant angles, you can perform the
operation in the most genteel company.
* * * *
“Esk D.”; It’s about a mile to Har-
bin’s place across the paddocks, but Arch
says it’ll be quicker if he catches the
nag and drives over. Does he want you
to lend a hand? Aw, no, it wouldn’t be
him owning a nag that gives trouble that
way. It looks simple when you watch
him stalking the sleepy chestnut switching
flies under the solitary greybox, but the
nag saunters away at precisely the same
speed as Arch is making. Arch breaks
into a run. The chestnut speeds up to
maintain a steady two-chain lead across
the shimmering paddock to the far fence
near Harbin’s, where it swings in a canter
back to the tree and more fly-switching.
Arch approaches more warily next time,
but the ruse is repeated. The third rally
is much faster, the result similar. Arch
flings the bridle away savagely and comes
back for the axe. The visit to Harbin’s
is deferred while he works off his frus-
tration on the greybox. “That’ll teach
the blankard t’ come his monkey tricks,”
Arch says, “Anyway, Harbie’ll unner-
stand about it bein’ too much of a drag
walkin’ over, partic’ly this flamin’ hot
weather.”

“E. 2”: Dan and a string of assorted
tykes were staging an attack on the rabbit
population of his top paddock which
resided in two large warrens. It was
hot, dry weather, and about midday Dan
made his way stealthily to the warrens
and filled-in the burrows ; then he put
the dogs to work along the sheltered bank
of the creek. Rabbits in a stream broke
away from cover and fell easy victims
at the warrens in the resultant confusion.
Dan got an impressive total of bunnies
before the hounds gave up and flopped
in the stream, too tired to cock an»eye
for the few stragglers that were left.

“Hanko”: It surprised me not
when Little Joe’s glowing cigarette
changed suddenly into a white light-
house that swept lurid flashes over
a heaving, brown-splashed saucepan,
but what irked me with the set-
up was that the warning beacon kept
sagging perilously from the perpendicular,
so much so, that eventually it crashed
down upon the little bloke’s bare chest.
In the gloom, we stared agape while
Little Joe squirmed and writhed con-
vulsively in his bunk, till finally, when
the lighted fag got beneath his buttocks,
he flipped on to the floor with the action
of a crackerjack beetle. “That’s what y’
git for smokin’ in bed an’ droppin’ orf
to sleep,” growled Big Joe. “I didn’t
drop orf to sleep,” howled Little Joe.
“This mug here [pointing at me] scared
me by yellin’ out ‘Tiger.’” With the
taste of curried chops still strong in my
gizzard I climbed wearily back into bunk.

“Don Drone”; I have often watched
bees after losing their stings (B. 1/1 / ’47),
and only rarely have they even reached
the hive entrance. The general reaction
is reminiscent of a blowfly which has
had a liberal dose of flyspray perform-
ing its dorsal gyrations. An interesting
point about stinging is tfyat the worker
never uses her hypodermic on drones,
but ejects the unfortunate! male of the
species by breaking the bas|b of the wing
with her mandibles, presumably to avoid
useless loss of life. \
COCKIES.
The Land, the Land! The Land, of course, is
The greatest of our great resources,
The nation’s budget swelling—•
As patriots in good positions.
Like journalists and politicians
And even publicans and preachers,
Trades-union delegates and teachers
Are never tired of telling. '
The dwellers in the rustic places,
Who wipe the salt sweat from their faces,
In neither scorn nor malice
Accept this frequent adulation
In print and eloquent oration —
This oft-repeated commendation
Of their great worth —without elation,
In fact, cum grano salts.
Known overseas as “country bumpkins,”
Our cockies, bent on raising pumpkins
And other products lowly
Like pigs and spuds, are not delighted
With testimonials indited,
And get not, as a rule, excited
Unless their blinking crops are blighted
By some new curse unholy.
They have no flair with words to juggle:
Engaged in one unending struggle
To meet their bills and taxes.
They rarely get beyond surmising
Why prices rise and keep on rising;
They have no gift for analysing
The cause of shortages surprising
In handles for wood-axes.
The cocky knows he cannot slacken
On briars, brambles, scrub and bracken —
His main preoccupation
When not engaged in grubbing, clearing,
In branding calves, or.jumbucks shearing;
In milking cows, in ploughing, sowing;
In all the jobs that keep him going,
Enslaved to Occupation.
He mends the fences round the dairy;
He patches shoes for Jim and Mary;
Cuts wood for recreation,
Carts water when the skies are leaden,
When Daisy—bogged—the mud is dead in;
And Major (never better bred in
Gippsland) is harnessed up and led in
To help incineration.
So, checking vile, voracious habits
Of crickets, cutworms, birds and rabbits —
No other pests we’ll mention —•
The Cocky’s mood is not hilarious.
Of Fortune’s meagre chance aware he is,
But seeks, by efforts hard and various,
To make a living small, precarious,
And dodge the Old-Age Pension.
VICTORIA.

“Horseless Horseman”; Do blokes out
west still bet on whose quart pot will boil
first? Twenty years ago in the mustering
parties on Toorak station, Nelia (N.Q.), it
was a regular thing, usually with a tin
of tobacco in the pool; winner take all.
You drew for positions on the fire, quart
pots were ceremoniously stood on two
sticks and you stoked only until the um-
pire said “Stop!” When I owed pounds
of tobacco I woke up that the old hands
used special D-shaped, thin quart pots
with the carbon left on thick. At times
I’ve seen fellows —so thirsty they could
spit sixpences—kick their quarts over in
disgust at losing. Riding up to a bag-
man’s camp on the Mackinlay stock-
route I put my quart on his fire while he
suspended a billy of water next to a can
of boiling spuds. I had made my pot
of tea and had half-finished my lunch,
and still the old boy’s tea-billy wouldn’t
boil. With a mighty kick he sent it
and the water flying over the landscape.
Then, turning to the boiling spuds, he
directed another well-aimed kick with the
remark “You were as bad yesterday!”

“Notaden”: “Naturala” (B. 29/1/’47)
and the “Service Department” are unduly
parsimonious in limiting Australia’s
cockroach supplies to three and two kinds
respectively. R. J. Tillyard enumerated
300 indigenous Australian cockroach
species, and six in N.Z. The record in
blackness and evil odor alike goes to
one of the New Zealanders, known most
unfavorably as the “Maori bug.” No
dinkum Aussie cockroach ever goes into
a house except by accident, and it gets
out as quickly as it can. The four kinds
of elusive, destructive, smelly, food-
spoiling home-curses which will eat any-
thing from one’s hair to their own dead
are all imported. The reddish-brown,
strong-flying American cockroach is the
biggest of them ; the Australian (wrongly
so - called) cockroach, next in size,
can be recognised by the yellow ring on
its first thoracic segment. The pestilential
brown or yellow German cockroach —■
known in Germany as the Russian cock-
roach —is only half as big as the others
but a far greater nuisance than both put
together. The dark brown Oriental cock-
roach, smallest of the unpopular four, is
identical with the English “black beetle.”
Some of our dinkum Aussie ’roaches are
very beautiful folk, brilliantly attired in
yellow and metallic green.

“Volt”: How much juice does it take
to electrocute a flying-fox? I had some
power lines running from the meter to
the cow-shed. One morning there were
12 foxes hanging on the wire, dead as
nails. As it happened I’d read the meter
the previous night. A professional reader
may have been able to do something with
it; to my inexperienced eye there wasn’t
“Could you direct me to the nearest hotel?”
a shift in the position of the needle, after
allowing a couple of hours’ light for the
two 40-watt bulbs. I’ve seen a fox hook
one wing over one wire and reach for
a support on the other; as soon as the
second wing touched the second wire
there was nothing further to report: the
flying-fox just hung limp without a
quiver. Though one of the nuisances may
be attached to two wires, there’s no short-
ing, even if it’s raining and the body is
wet. There must be a passage of current
when it’s alive, else it wouldn’t be shocked
to death.

“Mrs. Stumpjump” Re the “Sundry
Shows” review of “Harvest Gold” (B.
1/1 / ’47). The scenario writer certainly
did miss a chance of giving the tractor an
advertisement if he left his audience in
any doubt as to how the remaining wheat
crops were faring while the neighbors
harvested the sick farmer’s crop. The
film might also have shown heavily-laden
lorries tearing into the railway siding
with the full complement of the tractor
farmer’s wheat, while the horse cocky
was starting on his first paddock. Still,
does any horse-lover need conversion
to the value of a tractor at harvest-time?
In the old days, both my husband and
father used to finish each harvest hating
themselves for the hard driving they had
to give their teams in the long, hot after-
noons. Even though they generally man-
aged a dinner-time change of horses, they
were glad to buy a tractor and get through
their harvest without heat- and fly-
tortured Dobbins.

“Pisces”: During a wet season at
Proserpine (N.Q.) —and it really does rain
up there —a farmer went down one morn-
ing to see how the river was rising. In
one corner of his paddock, where a big
creek came in at an acute V, he heard a
rustling in the grass, which was high, and
wet enough to make a soaked sponge
resemble Urandangie in a drought. The
farmer, a strict teetotaller —some of them
are —picked up a stick and went forward
for the kill. Snakes? No ; a string of
barramundi, each about 2ft, to 3ft. long,
worming their way through the grass to-
wards the creek to save a long swim down
to the point of the V. When the man
with the stick got among them they broke
and scattered like a mob of sheep. I
helped to eat the one that didn’t get away.

“X.S.”: A Horsham (Vic.) man was
recently stung into displaying Sherlock
Holmes qualities he probably never knew
he had. Bees attacked him and his wife
and also allegedly destroyed a grape crop.
He dusted some of the intruders with
flour and insecticide and pursued them
in their flight back to the hives of an
apiarist neighbor. Result was a charge
of trespass against the hymenoptera or
their owner. Defendant argued that when
his bees left their hives they were out
of control and no longer the responsi-
bility of their owner. Plaintiff deposed
that they were domesticated animals, like
cows and horses. The P.M. accepted the
submission and fined the beekeeper £3O.

“Plop”; Man’s conviction that he is
the only animal capable of constructive
thinking has been in need of bolstering
ever since Eve did her apple-trick. Over
the past few years, evidence of this
alleged brain-power has been so slight
that scientists have begun to wonder if
we are so hot after all, and have made
a series of tests with other animals. The
scientists declare that “intelligence is
measured by the animal’s ability to solve
a new problem by a thought process,” and
their usual means of finding this is with
a “maze-test.” They have found that after
a couple of tries a mouse can weave
his way unconcernedly through the worst
they have to offer, but as soon as they
change a portion of the maze the little
bloke becomes stumped and makes the
scientists feel very superior. So far our
I.Q. has been rated well ahead of all the
other animals with backbones. Now the
tests are going to be applied to those
without internal support, starting with the
octopus, “selected because it has the most
highly-developed brain of all invertebrate
creatures.” They hope to get his legs
tangled by “testing his reactions to colored
lights, musical sounds and foods with an
unpleasant taste.” Then he is to go
through the maze-test. If I know my
squids, he will just sit in the bottom of
his bowl, blowing bubbles of amused
contempt.

Sarsaparilla?” the boss asked when she

“Old Camp”: The most ingenious leg-
less barrow that rolled Coolgardiewards
in the Roaring Days had as rotor and
foundation a stout beer hogshead. With
a couple of 2in. pipe flanges bolted on
the centre of the ends as bearings, a
length of lyin. pipe through as an axle,
a pair of shafts bolted centrally, one on
each end of the axle, a pair of brackets
bolted again in to these, a wide plat-
form was built just high enough to clear
the top of the barrel. Along the front
and rear of this platform, at right-angles
to the shafts, a pair of long shafts again
was fixed, with handle-ends projecting
long enough for a man to take a double
grip and march with the weight of the
load against his chest. Four men’s lug-
gage could be piled on the platform, and
with four men at the handles the barrow
rolled, traversing sandplain, bumping
over ruts and other obstacles with no
great difficulty. And long after its use
for transport was ended the barrel, bot-
tom flange hole plugged, served as a
water tank, worth its weight in gold when
rain fell.

“Roadent”: What manner of surfacing
have those American engineers perfected
that they must employ sound-detectors to
trace road corrugations to a mere 15
feet (B. 15/l/’47)? On some Westralian
roads you can see them to that depth.
Many a motorist travelling in a strange
locality has been surprised to find the
Darling Ranges encroaching so far on to
the coastal plains.

“Gravelsnatcher”: Humane traps (B.
15/1/’47)? Farmers throughout the
Westralian wheatbelt have for years em-
ployed a variant of “C.E.’s” wire-netting
box. In place of his hinged door the
entrances are holes in the netting, behind
which are “sleeves” of the same material
leading into the box and tapering slowly,
ending in a circle of jagged edges. Bunny
enters along the sleeve easily enough, but
won’t force his way back through the
points. I’ve seen young rabbits caught
thus climb the sides of the cage, push
their heads through the mesh at the top
and hang themselves. These traps are
placed at points along the netting fences
where the rabbits have burrowed under-
neath. But by far the best results are
obtained by netting the dams and plac-
ing the cages inside the fence at con-
veniently spaced holes. In the dry, rain-
less summer rabbits will travel miles for
water. My record is 2000 trapped in one
night at one dam.

“Blime”: Bill rode slowly into the
shade and pulled up. With hand-waves
and a couple of low commands he sent
his sheep dogs hurrying in different direc-
tions before he dropped down for a doze.
After a bit he sat up, roved an eye over
the scenery, and whistled encouragingly,
till presently, one after the other, the
dogs appeared, each driving a small mob
of sheep. With the mobs boxed. Bill
ordered one dog in charge and sent the
other out once more in a further direc-
tion. It could be glimpsed at intervals
combing, the ridges ; three-quarters of an
hour later it arrived back with a few
stragglers. “Ben’s musterin’ the east
side,” Bill told me languidly. “Left an
hour or so afore me. Got t’ pick him
up further down.” We drifted on, the
dogs bringing the sheep ; then, reaching
the main gully, Bill again dropped into
the shade. An hour later Ben’s mob
appeared, the rider dashing from side to
Side, urging his jummies with whip and
voice. “Look at him, will y’!” snorted
Bill disgustedly, as the approaching nag
showed in a lather of sweat and his rider’s
red dial trickled small streams. “A man
oughter make the cow muster on foot.
Why, he’s too damn’ lazy to break in his
dogs!”

“Betcha”: Only trouble with “Billy
See’s” advice (B. 8/1/’47) that poultry-
farmers “would sleep more at ease should
they add a few geese to their flocks”, is
that he neglects to say how the farmer
is to get to sleep in the first place, let
alone stay there. My short experience
with geese taught me they break into a
honking chorus at every slight or im-
agined movement of the night, their pro-
test a discordant clamor that rivals a
swing band with the volume on. Prob-
ably it was one of these birds that eventu-
ally wandered past the abode of Rip Van
Winkle, and maybe we shall yet see some
desperate reformewintroducing them into
the equipment of Government offices.

“Wamberal”: Wading on the tide-
covered flats of Tuggerah (N.S.W.) one
bright morning I could see whiting flash-
ing and gleaming in the shallows. I
hurried ashore, got a line and sixpenn’orth
of prawns, peeled portion of the
latter, baited up, threw out and began
gently trolling. After a couple of tenta-
tive nibbles nothing happened, though the
tasty fish were still making heliographs
in the sun-lit tide-water. Tired of wad-
ing, I stood in about a foot of water,
somewhat wistfully regarding the shoals
all about me and wishing there was some
way to persuade them that prawn was
good bait. 'Then I caught sight of a
larger shadow which weaved among the
others. There was a broad flash of silver,
and out of the water came the first half of
a big bluenose with corns on his fins. He
paused long enough for me to glimpse
the rear end of a squirter in his mouth,
gave me a sardonic look and vanished.
Sunstroke or no sunstroke, I heaved that
parcel of prawn into the briny and
headed for the mud-flats and the squirter
holes. Yes, I ate whiting for tea, but
the big bluenose wasn’t among ’em.

“Colonial Cove”: Anyone know the
origin Of the term “dunnage”? My guess
is that it derives from a George Dun-
nage who, in the latter part of 1829,
tried to become a Swan River settler. A
passenger on the first of Thomas Peel’s
transports, Golmore, Mr. Dunnage found
himself dumped on the east shore of
Cockbum Sound with what was possibly
the greatest volume of personal effects
ever brought to Australia. The in-
ventory, still preserved in the archives,
covers six pages of closely-written fools-
cap, and lists such trifles as a piano,
suites of Chippendale furniture, book-
cases, crates of books, tables, chairs,
crockery, a seine net, hand nets, farm
and garden implements, feather beds in
casks, bedsteads—in fact, everything that
human foresight could perceive as being
of use in a new country. The stuff re-
mained on the beach, exposed to sun,
rain and wind, for a year or more ; then
Dunnage decided that the Swan River
settlement was not for him.
YELLOW PATCH.
Twenty miles to Yellow Patch,
Twenty miles of sea,
Every different shade of blue
From Yellow Patch to me.
I’ve never been to Yellow Patch
That stands across the bay;
In Caloundra here I gaze upon
Those dunes so far away.
Across the sea some day I’ll go
When the wind and tide are right,
Blue sky above, blue sea below
And a patch of yellow in sight.
What I will find I do not know,
Maybe but golden sand,
But I will walk on Yellow Patch
And touch it with my hand.

"DON'T WORRY.I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Wool Sales Congestion.
“Murrawong”: When the war-time ap-
praisement scheme ended woolbrokers
pointed out that the average number of
bales per lot was only 2.9. Growers were
asked to return to pre-war classing
standards and to make big bulky lines in
order to overcome the congestion at the
selling centres. An analysis of recent
sales shows that the improvement is very
slight, and the point has now been
reached when buyers have refused to
handle more than 10,000 bales a day. In
five selling days in Sydney since the New
Year 49,325 bales were offered —an aver-
age of 9865 per day.
These comprised 3713 big lots (five
bales or more) and 11,368 star lots. Thus
75 p.c. of the total lots offered were in
the star-lots catalogues, and this would
have been exceeded but for the inter-
lotting of a number of two-, three- and
four-bale lots which brought them into
the main catalogue. For the five days
sales the average number of bales per
lot was 3.27. That position would have
been much worse had it not been for
the relief afforded by reclassing and pool-
ing firms whose work was responsible for
making the equivalent of over 2000 bales
eligible for the big lots.
A comparison of any hroker’s two
catalogues (big and star lots) of the same
day will afford growers some idea of the
immensity of the task entailed in hand-
ling, showing and valuing star lots. In
one day’s sale one broker’s catalogue had
over 2000 of them.
Something must be dope—and quickly
—to build up the average lot. The grower
will have to pay for the extra work in-
volved in locating these small lots in the
brokers’ bulk stacks, in opening and dis-
playing bales on the show floor, in cata-
loguing and valuing ; while buyers must
increase their staffs to cope with inspect-
ing and valuing. An order from over-
seas for 50 bales of a certain type may
be filled by the purchase of four big lots,
but in the star lots the buyer may have
to purchase 40 lots, and it would take
him ten times as long to find the types in
the huge catalogue, while the additional
office work entailed is on the same ratio.
These extra costs may pass unnoticed
in the high prices obtained for wool to-
day, but they will be felt when prices
drop, as they must.
Subdivision of big properties aggravates
the position, and the building of appraise-
ment centres in the country will, if any-
thing, increase the difficulties. The solu-
tion would appear to lie in a compulsory
bulk-classing or pooling scheme for all
bags, butts and single- and double-bale
lots. With the latter out of the way the
star lots could probably survive with
three- and four-bale lots.
• _
Managing the Bull.
“Atlanta”: The bull should be kept
from the herd in a separate run securely
fenced and provided with adequate water
and shelter. A small service yard and a
crush to facilitate handling of the bull
are necessary. By keeping the bull away
from the herd calving can be regulated,
it is easier to determine whether a cow
is in calf, the bull’s services are con-
trolled and not wasted and there is less
likelihood of cows having to return to
the bull.
Barbed wire won’t always stop a roam-
ing bull, but if his enclosure is away from
roads and adjoining properties a lot of
breaking in or out will be avoided and
the danger that strays suffering from
disease will infect the owner’s herd is
greatly lessened.
Where it is customary to run the bull
with the herd he should be locked up at
night and kept away from the cows in
the milking yard or when handling.
Horn-tips should be sawn off. At all
times he should be treated with the great-
est respect. A long-handled pitch-fork is
a useful weapon with which to command
the respect of a bad - tempered bull,
though most of the patented bull-bafflers
will discourage treachery or aggressive-
ness. An armful of freshly-cut lucerne,
or lucerne-hay twice daily in addition
to the usual ration will keep him in top
condition.
Horse-breeding Country.
“E.H.S.”: Some of the finest saddle
horses I’ve seen were raised on rough,
hilly, limestone country, from good-type
“Keep a look-out for a finger-post, Jim.”
light mares mated with a large-framed,
compactly-built thoroughbred. The re-
sulting stock showed fine muscular
development and symmetrically formed
feet with hard, sound hoofs. They were
good doers on any kind of country, sure-
footed as goats, with a good turn of speed,
and no day was too long for them. Stock
bred on identical lines but raised on well-
grassed plain country interspersed with
shallow swamps’ and salt-pans were of
little use except as knockabout hacks.
These horses were light in bone and
muscle, and many of them developed
large, flat, spongy - hoofed feet, which
made them clumsy and unsafe to ride
over rough or slippery surfaces. It’s my
opinion these faults were due almost
entirely to the nature of the country on
which they were raised, and not to any
inherent weakness in the animals them-
selves. Mountain-bred horses are superior
to those raised on the plains, as the con-
ditions under which they live favor mus-
cular development, endurance and sure-
footedness to a marked degree.
Profitable Dairying.
“E. 2”: Dairymen in north-east Vic-
toria are getting returns of up to £5 and
a shade higher a cow a month, and the
present good season should ensure reason-
able profits for the full lactation period of
nine months. Best of the river flats are
valued at around £5O an acre, and there’s
not much of it changing hands now.
Clovers, rye-grass and cocksfoot is the
standard mixture for pastures, and with
super, topdressing the grazing is excep-
tionally good for milkers and large
tonnages are cut as grass hay. It’s neces-
sary to conserve fodder to see the stock
through the hard winters, when all growth
is practically at a standstill.
Calving is usually in early August, in
some cases earlier, and the flush of the
season is reached in October and may
hold till January. The spring growth is
fairly reliable in supplying seasonal
demands, but when the grass dries off
shortly after Christmas the cream cheques
may drop sharply. On some low-lying
flats there is poor drainage and these
“wet” flats produce a lot of green feed
during summer; on others, millet or
maize for grazing is useful in keeping
up production.
Labor and other costs have risen steeply
in the last few years, but the increased
price of butterfat has more than offset
them and there has been heavy and un-
satisfied demand for labor for harvesting,
milking, general farm work and building.
The high income tax has proved a formid-
able handicap, and many of the large
holdings are worked as family syndicates
to lessen the liability. Good profits and
low taxation would pave the way to
farming on sound lines, for the farmer
with working capital has decided advan-
tages in improving and maintaining his
property.
Dairy cattle, very dear and hard to
procure at present, are on the improve,
and it shouldn’t be long before there is
enough good stock available for building
up deteriorated and scrubber herds.
Classy heifers are bound to be expensive
for some time to come, but their worth
compared to nondescripts makes them
better buying at the higher prices.
An Erosion Station.
“Graz”: Work was started on the
Wellington (N.S.W.) soil-conservation
station of 450 acres in 1944. Across
eroded gullies wide, shallow contour
drains were ploughed to carry the water
into a silt dam which had been scooped
out in a badly-eroded spot. The dam
empties into a 2000-c.y. tank, put down
by bulldozer and large scoop on a site
where deep, eroded gullies met. It empties
in turn on to a grassed waterway—a
hollow down the slope cultivated and
sown to lucerne and Wimmera rye. To
prevent the worked-up soil washing away
blocks are constructed across the water-
way about a chain apart by fastening
wire-netting over rolls of straw.
Once the land is contoured or pasture-
furrowed the eroded gullies are then
filled in, supered and sown to grasses and
legumes. The whole principle of con-
touring is to steady up the flow of water.
Contours have a fall of only 6in. per
100 ft., and vary from 4ft. to Bft. apart
according to slope. Contours empty water
slowly on to the grassed waterways or
into the dams. Pasture furrows are
terraces as dug by Chinese and Italians
1000 years ago. Ploughed around the
slopes on a dead level with earth blocks
across at intervals along their length
water lies in these furrows until it soaks
into the earth.
Some soils are too clayey for pasture
furrows, but in suitable soils this method
is our best antidote to drought. Un-
fortunately it is a slow and costly busi-
ness. The soil-conservation project at
Gulgong (N.S.W.) estimates costs at £2
per acre. Future trials will show whether
benefits derived would justify the expense
of pasture-furrowing land not subject to
erosion.
That Tennis Court.
“Pat O’Day”; Select a suitable site,
preferably land running parallel with the
house and outside the garden so as not
to detract from the garden design. If
there is a decided slope in the ground
the difficulty may be overcome by laying
out the court to run so that the slope is
across the width. It is much easier to
level off.
The playing area is 78ft. x 36ft., with
as much over as desired for space outside
the back, and side lines. Take a strong
piece of twine and with a stout wire-
nail lay down a line of any length more
than 48ft. as your base line.
After length and width (78ft. x 36ft.)
have been pegged, allow an additional
4ft. at sides, and 9ft. from back lines
and measure for the poles to enclose the
court. Sink post-holes to depth of 2ft.
Paint them white after they have been
erected. Prepare the ground by chipping
or using sump-oil to kill the grass. Water
well, put a 2in. thickness of white sandy
loam or ant-hill soil and use roller to
firm this in. Sink a post each side (36ft.
apart) on sidelines to hold net. Buy a
tennis-marker for marking lines. For a
bitumen-surface court (much more satis-
factory and does not need attention),
after grading, wet the surface and place
one coating of tar. Allow to set, add
light gravel. After a day or two complete
with final coat of tar, Roll it when tar
dries off.
Rubber Vines.
“Wotcher”: Should an untoward oc-
currence cause Charters Towers to be
evacuated I venture to say that in a very
short time the site would become an
impenetrable jungle of wild rubber vines.
Specimens of rubber and fibre we’re sent
to Canberra in 1942 in the hope that
some use could be made of them. Un-
fortunately the yield was not great
enough, though at the Towers the Gov-
ernment actually took over a number of
acres of ground, ploughed and prepared
to plant it, and then abandoned the pro-
ject, as the U.S. artificial product be-
came more plentiful.
Nothing more has been done, except
by the prolifically blossoming vines which
grow and grow and grow! The waving
canes, thick as a man’s two fingers, seem
to taper to a limit of 30ft. or so when
the whip-like point either bends over to
intertwine with a neighboring vine when
the end dies or else bends back to the
ground. Children delight in gathering

the milk, which they either spread thinly
on a piece of tin, when it dries into a
transparent thin sheet, or put it into a
container. If the former they proceed
to wind off the rubber between finger
and thumb into balls. If the latter they
add water, boil it, tip off the water, which
leaves a snow-white pliable lump. The
“bounce” is such that many a ball is lost
on the roof! The fibre, easily stripped
off the bark in yard or so lengths, is ex-
tremely strong. In appearance it looks
like cotton or linen thread. I have seen
beautifully soft stuffed toys and cushions,
the padding being the soft, flossy seed
covering of the vines.
Hints for the Farm.
“Buro”: Prevention of girth-gall is
better than cure, because the skin re-
mains tender for a long time after severe
chafing. Girths should be kept pliable by
soft-soapipg away sweat marks and dry-
ing carefully. Hardened girths should
never be used. Young horses should be
accustomed to harness gradually. Should
galls appear they should be washed with
salt and water (a teaspoon to a pint)
twice daily. When healed continue with
the saline wash or apply cold tea or a
solution of wattle bark. If there is proud
flesh powdered bluestone is effective,
blown on through a paper funnel.
“Myrrhee”: Production will never
reach a high level if the cow isn’t in good
condition at calving, with reserves of fat
and protein built up during the dry
period. She is likely to suffer from diges-
tive upsets if brought straight from poor
feed on to good. N.S.W. Department of
Agriculture recommends for the dry cow
not on first-class pasture 51b. concentrates
a day for six weeks before calving, in
addition to a full feed of roughage. That
quantity of oats per day for six weeks
would take 155.-wortlr of oats. An in-
crease of only 20 gallons of milk at 9d.
a gallon would pay for this feed, but
yields are often much greater, amounting
to between 100 and 300 gallons.
“Big Billy”: Wimmera rye is the best
grass for fertile soils. Its vigorous growth
is a disadvantage on lighter soils, as it
is not a soil-builder, but on heavier land
it provides good pasture and controls
thistles.
“Prof”: At this time of year grass-
seeds are a worry to working dogs, and
if their feet are not looked after the
seeds penetrate the flesh and cause ugly
sores. Examine between toes at least
once a week and remove all grass-seeds.
If any have penetrated pull them out with
tweezers and paint the wound with
methylated spirits.
“E.V.S.”: The secret of a close-fitting,
level job when patching with muntz or
other light metal lies solely in the tack-
ing. Tack from the centre outward. First
tack the patch in centre to hold in posi-
tion, then from centre of top line tack
right and left alternately but not to the
exact end. Then follow with bottom and
sides in like manner. Right-angle and
round edges can be covered by snipping
the metal iin. deep at intervals and tack-
ing as' above ; the edges will draw to-
gether.
“E.H.S.”; For blacking melt 4oz. of
mutton suet with Boz, of beeswax, add
9oz. of crystallised sugar, 4oz. soft soap
dissolved in water and loz. of lampblack.
When melted and well mixed add half-
pint of turpentine. Lay it on with a
sponge and polish off with a brush. A
good oil for farm and team harness can
be made by melting 31b. of beef tallow
until it liquefies, then pour in gradually
one pint of neatsfoot oil and stir until
cold. If properly prepared the grease
will be perfectly smooth and soft; if not
it will be more or less granulated. Color
with a little lampblack.
“Scratch Cocky”: “Sundowner” tB.
25/12/’46) in his points in favor of silage
over hay did not mention what is prob-
ably its greatest gain—its non-negotia-
bility. Because it must be consumed on
the farm the cocky is not tempted to sell
silage whenever he is short of a few bob
(a chronic state with most of us), as he
often is with hay or grain.
“Bai”: Cattle should not be allowed
to camp near thb milking-sheds. They
should be turned out as soon as milked
and brought in just when needed. Plenty
of shade should be provided for the
poddy calves. Shelter-sheds are necessary
in cold weather. Extremes of heat and
cold have a detrimental effect on poddies.
During a dry winter rugging will t save
fodder.
“Hoola”: When planting trees this
autumn choose, for preference, fodder
trees. Lucerne-trees and “old-man” salt
bush, myall, etc,, should not be neglected.
The time spent in erecting tree guards
along creek banks and watercourses will
be well repaid by the good work done
by the roots and dropped branches of the
trees in counteracting erosion.
“Bat”: The most valuable tree to the
farmer is the kurrajong, decorative,
hardy and useful. Wheatfarmers value
each tree at £lOO. It Will thrive where
the rainfall does not drop below ten
inches, and is invaluable for fodder
during drought. White cedars are beauti-
ful and very suitable for home shade.
Swampy areas can be beautified by plant-
ing willows and oleanders. The latter also
do well in dry situations. Double-pink
aqd cream are most attractive varieties.
“H. McV.”: “Handy Hints for the
Farm” is as good a shillingsworth as
anyone could want. What strikes me
about the book is that it’s most useful
to anybody, for the townsman with a
few 1 chooks or vegetables in his back-
yard can get as much from it as a farmer.

FAMOUS SINCE 1750

MY SUMS. THE NECK OF HER
DRESS COMES OPEN.
The secret that had been hers for so
many years was out at last. And the
shame of her small deceit scorched her
with almost physical suffering.
The morbid curiosity of the child re-
sponsible for the note surprised her not
at all. She had been teaching normal,
healthy, vulgar-minded young people for
too many years to be shocked at anything
they did.
But the indignity of being found out
was hard to bear. The story would be
carried into every home, into the mill, on
to the canefields. Teacher’s bust would
be subject for .varied lurid jokes for a
good many years.
Miss Penrith tore the paper into tiny
pieces. Somebody else should suffer with
her. Of that much she was determined.
THE whole school was well behaved
during that long, hot, sultry afternoon.
Miss Penrith hardly gave them a chance
to be anything else. Something in her
steely eyes cautioned them against
frivolity.
“Now.” Miss Penrith settled herself
behind the desk. It was stained with
patches of colored inks, stamped with
Special Merits and carried the initials of
many bored pedagogues.
Terence O’Leary stood in front of it,
looking more than a little frightened.
He kept twisting a stub of chalk round
and round in his grimy paws. He had
been made to clean the blackboards while
the other children were dismissed, and the
scrap of chalk, lying under one easel, had
been a glorious find.
Miss Penrith, starting off with a fine,
devouring wrath which could be expected
to produce satisfactory results, looked
into his worried blue eyes and was non-
plussed. They were not the sharp, prying
eyes that had peered at the secrets of her
neckline.
She sighed. “Terence, if you did not
write that note, who did?” Relief,
laughably obvious, flowed into his pinched
countenance.
“I dunno, Miss. Somebody give it to
me.”
The slender, manicured fingers of Miss
Penrith caressed the smooth sides of a
ruler.
“I think you do know, Terence. Tell
me his —or her—name.”
He shook his rough head.
v “Not me, Miss. Wallop me if you
like. I can’t tell.”
She discerned the lack of nobility in
this stand. Somebody would obviously
deliver a much more feared punishment
if he did tell.
a very untidy boy, Terence.”
She said, changing the subject. “Who
looks after you?”
“Mum. She looks after us all. Katy,
she stops home to help.”
“What happened to your face?”
“They picked on me coming to school.”
He wiped a rough, woollen sleeve across
his troublesome nose and sniffed. The
results were hardly effective. He sniffed
again.
“Who picked on you?”
“The Ities. They’re always picking on
me.”
“What do you mean? They fight
you?”
“Roll me in the dirt sometimes. Or
in the creek. Sometimes they just plain
fight.”
Miss Penrith’s high nose quivered in
disgust. “What beastly little swipes! I’d
like to give them a piece of my mind.
Ganging up on a lone boy like that.”
He looked surprised.
“No, Miss, they don’t gang up. Only
one fights me. The others just stand
around and laugh and yell out.”
“But —you fight back, don’t you?”
Perplexity in Miss Penrith’s voice.
Failure to fight-back was unheard of.
One simply fought and held on till the
last,
TERENCE’S eyes dropped floorwards.
“I’m not much good at fighting,” he
said surlily. Apparently the point had
been raised before by would-be reformers.
“But you’re British!” After that cry
of protest from Miss Penrith could
almost be heard the echoes of a ghostly
voice calling “Up the flag!” The school-
room was very still, with the teacher
staring, horrified, at the object of utter
dejection before her,
“Irish;” he corrected evasively.
“It’s the same difference.” In her
agitation she used a flippancy of speech
for which she had often reprimanded
scholars. “And they’re Italian —haven’t
you any pride?”
“I don’t know.” He rubbed one blunt
toe along a crack between the boards.
“I’ll speak to your father,” Miss Pen-
rith announced decisively. “You should
be taught to protect yourself. It’s a sin
to let such a state of affairs go on.”
A brief smile showed Miss Penrith the
gaps in Terence’s front teeth and a por-
tion of scarlet tongue.
“You can’t, Miss.” He seemed highly
amused at the prospect, “He’s dead ’
“Oh. I’m very sorry, Terence.” For-
mality required that apology in spite of
the twinkle in the blue eyes opposite.
Death was an occasion for deepest re-
grets to Miss Penrith’s way of thinking.
The boy’s jocularity was out of place
and it must be brought home to him,
“Very sorry indeed. I, too, have ex-
perienced the deep loss of a loved
one ...”
“Booze finished him off,” Terence in-
formed her. “It was a terrible funny
thing—there he was one minute right as
pie and the next ...”
“You have no big brothers? Nobody
who could teach you a little about —well,
self-defence?”
“No, Miss.”
Miss Penrith looked at him so unsee-
ingly for so long that he began to shuffle
restlessly.
“Very well, Terence. You may go
now. Good afternoon.”
“G’afternoon, Miss Penrith.” Terence
scuttled doorwards, thankful to be mak-
ing his escape with no serious conse-
quences.
THREE days later a book arrived with
the remainder of Miss Penrith’s mail.
She tore off the wrappings eagerly and
it fell, bright frontal jacket uppermost,
on to the desk.
There was a photo of a young colored
man with rippling muscles like coiled
springs under his silky skin. He was
naked but for a pair of scarlet trunks
and laced shoes. He was poised in an
attitude of offence and, like a panther
ready to pounce, seemed to hold a
promise of infinite power in the easy
alertness of his body.
In large black print were the follow-
ing words: —-
Attain World Championship Class in
Ten Easy Lessons.
While Miss Penrith munched the
cucumber sandwiches and spicy sausage
rolls provided by Mrs. Marconelli she
devoured with equally lusty appetite the
contents of the book. Indigestion on all
scores followed, but it was only the first
reading. Many more were to follow.
A week later Miss Penrith again de-
tained Terence O’Leary after school.
Several times he had shown signs of
bloodthirsty warfare waged by boys who
had no fear of the results. Observing
these insults to Britain, Miss Penrith had
hardened her heart and read the book
with renewed zest.
The school was empty. The last shout-
ing voice had faded into the distance. All
books and school equipment had been put
away.
Magpies scrambling for crusts and
scraps of cake in the school yard
quarrelled noisily.
Miss Penrith shifted a blackboard, leav-
ing a clear space. Then she turned to
the boy.
“Take off your pullover.”
He did so, wonderingly, to reveal a
bony, white frame shadowed with dusky
patches of ingrained grime where he had
failed to reach with a wash-rag for long
months. He wore a ragged, navy-blue
singlet.
“Now.” Miss Penrith struck an attitude
which she believed resembled that of the
black panther on the cover of her book.
“On your guard, boy. Put up your
hands!”
Miss Penrith was a success at Coona-
monga.

“U.L.V.A. promises better hotels with 10 p.m.
closing.”— Headline.
Interviewed by a member of the
Would-be-drinkers’ Union, a spokesman
for the publicans promised better ameni-
ties in Sydney hotels.
Among the improvements proposed, he
said, were extra bar rails, which would
be installed at strategic points on the floor
to enable those not fortunate enough to
be thrown against the bar to rest at least
one foot in comfort.
Overhead conveyors would be in-
stalled in better-class hotels to enable
patrons to be served without the strain
of reaching over the heads of the five
rows in front. Splash-guards would be
fitted as an extra service on Saturdays
and holidays. A suggestion that troughs
should be provided instead of glasses
had been considered, but abandoned as
savoring too much of Continental laxity
in drinking habits.
Facilities for patrons to drink with
their wives were contemplated, the spokes-
man continued, in the shape of trap-
doors in the outside wall of the bar,
through which drinkers of powerful
physique would be able to pass glasses
as nearly half-full as the vicissitudes of
the journey across the bar would permit.
The question of seating accommoda-
tion had been gone into, but was shelved
after a sub-committee on Moral Tone had
vetoed the idea of fixed seats. Any other
type of seat, it was thought, would be
subject to some hazard from breakage or
removal in the normal course of busi-
ness. As a compensating factor, how-
ever, there would be more standing room.
There might even, the spokesman con-
cluded, be beer.
PLUM.
Among the Relics.
“Yairs,” said the ancient guide, “this
’ere joint y’re standin’ in now is where ’e
lived for twenty-seven years before ’is
cobber Ben made ’im vice-King Billy. The
people o’ Redfern bought it and it’s now
a mewzeem. All the things y’ see ’angin’
on the walls is relics of ’is political life,
w’en the Squire fought so ’ard for the
toilin’, downtrodden masses.”
“I see,” said the visitor. “And I sup-
pose this fine park on the other side of
the road is a monument to his untiring
zeal on their behalf. No doubt it was
once a mass of vermin-riddled hovels
which he had converted to a playground
for the slum children.”
“Don’t be Uncle Willie! That park
was there before Billy was bom. There
is a monument to the Squire’s work for
the people o’ Redfern —or rather a few
of ’em. ’E visits ’em ev’ry now an’ then
to- see if them farms of ’is are makin’
good profits.”
“Then perhaps he scotched some great
social evil in his constituency; earned
the deep gratitude of his supporters by,
say, eradicating s.p. activities which used
to make his poor constituents poorer? Or
maybe he pursued a vigorous slum-
clearance programme and in place of
hovels had erected airy, roomy workers’
flats with all modern conveniences on the
lines of those built in Scandinavian
countries?”
“Are you kiddin’? If Billy had poked
his bib in an’ tried to put the s.p. mer-
chants out o’ business ’e’d’ve bin shot out
by the Labor League. Redfem’s proud
o’ the fact that w’en Billy went to Yarra-
lumla it ’ad more pubs, s.p. joints an’
tenement ’ouses where the doors open
right on to the footpath than any other
districk in Sydney. Billy wasn’t mug
enough to try to alter that.”
“What’s that model of a decrepit foot-
board tram there on the mantelpiece?”
asked the visitor.
' “That’s another thing the people o’
Redfern are grateful to Billy for,” went
on the guide. “Sydney ain’t got many
o’ them flash noo corridor-type trams
that the U.A.P. mob ’ad built, an’ none
of ’em ’as ever served Redfern —they’re
reserved for the silvertails of Cremorne,
Vaucluse an’ Rose Bay. Billy was in the
Guwerment for donkeys’ years as Trea-
surer an’ Preemyer, but ’e never made

“And these things here in a group—

“They’ve all been presented to Billy by

“I see,” remarked the visitor. “As a

THE OTHER FEĹOW'S MIND
Stay-at-Homes Fare Better
After five years in uniform I returned
early last year to my pre-war job in a
Government department. This year I
shall get three weeks’ annual leave, as
against four weeks for those who did not
don uniform, A similar state of affairs
will prevail for the next four or five
years, non-servicemen having accumulated
considerable leave during the war years,
when their annual vacation was reduced
to two weeks.
My yearly service leave consisted of
one rest day a .week, plus one extra day
each four weeks, and 16 days’ recreational
leave; total, 81 days. Those at home
had two days off each week-end, plus 10
days’ annual leave and nine public holi-
days ; total 123 days.
I am not growling at my three weeks’
leave, which I consider a fair and ade-
quate break, but I should feel more
tolerant towards my workmates if 1
could believe that their war-time “sacri-
fices” were real, and did not merely
amount to a postponement of privileges.
—Nogo (N.S.W-)-
Post-war Experience
In the Army I had plantai warts re-
moved from my foot three times. When
they began growing for the fourth time
I was back in civvies, so I went to the
Repatriation doctor in my home town.
He advised me to write to the Deputy
Commissioner of Repatriation and inquire
if I was eligible for treatment.
I wrote, giving dates and details. After
two months a reply came saying my
trouble had been accepted as war injury
and telling me to report to Repat., “pre-
pared to go to hospital for seven days.”
I reported, and after waiting three
hours saw a doctor. He extracted all the
details I had forwarded two months be-
fore, and said “You can go home now.
This has to go before a board. It might
take a week or ten days.”
It was two months before the local
doctor told me that Repatriation had de-
cided to give me treatment. Another
week passed and I received notification
to report to Heidelberg Hospital.
There, after giving the old particulars
(“Married?” “Dependants?” “Address?”
“Religion?”), I was allotted to a ward
and a bed and issued with pyjamas, and
at last saw the ward doctor. He looked
at my foot, made notes of the case and
said he would have me sent to a sur-
geon.
I was back in hospital in the morning.
Eight days passed before I was called
up, not by a surgeon, but by a skin
specialist—an Army captain, who pre-
scribed treatment and talked about
calling me up again in a fortnight. I
was discharged two days later.
The only explanation of the delay I
could get was that Army doctors were
doing the consultation work and Repat.
cases “just had to wait,” Every second
man in my ward complained about de-
lays and resulting difficulties in making
ends meet on 50s. a week for single men,
225. more for married men without
children and 9s. extra for each child
under 14 years.—A. J. M. (Vic.).
Army Pay
“Ek Dum” in “Our Sweated Forces”
(B. 22 1 1 j ’47) writes;
The rate of pension for those ranks
[i.e., lieutenant R.N., captain, or flight-
lieutenant] basically is £375, roughly £460
a year Australian—more than a married
Australian captain’s full pay.
This statement is not quite fair; it com-
pares the present British rate with the pre-
war Australian rate. An officer enlisted
during the war or now in the Interim
Army is paid at A.I.F. rates, which are
much better than “Ek Dum’s” distribu-
tions.
I am a married captain with one
child and I hold out my hand for £657 a
year, made up at the following daily rates
—active pay 245., field allowance 35., de-
ferred pay Is., gratuity 6d., family allot-
ment 7s. 6d. Excluding clothing allow-
ance and concessions this £657 is my
actual Wage. My effective wage is higher.
An Australian civilian with two depend-
ants on £BlO pays £l7O tax —I pay £2B,
so my effective wage is £BlO, In addition
to this I am quartered and rationed, worth
at least £l5O a year in these days of dis-
torted prices.
If “E.D.” wants to make a comparison,
let him do .so after Canberra announces
the post-war P.M.F. rates of pay—assum-
ing Canberra realises it won’t have a

post-war P.M.F. unless it does raise the
pay.— Jock (Vic.),
[“Jock” (Vic.) is assured of his pre-
sent opulent position because it suits the
Government to treat the war as still in
being. The only regulations in existence
for permanent- force peace-time pay, how-
ever, are the pre-war regulations. The
British rates “E.D.” quoted did not in-
clude war allowances or field allowance,]
More Round Pegs
The Army hasn’t a mortgage on the
habit of sending the wrong people to
schools of instruction (“T.5.,” 8.22/1 / ’47)
—the Commonwealth Public Service
favors the method, too. At the moment,
all linesmen and potential cable-jointers
employed by the P.M.G.’s Department
(N.S.W. Metropolitan) are being sent in-
discriminately to organised classes with
the idea of increasing both quality and
quantity of their work. Naturally, many
men go unwillingly, and after three weeks
of the school come out precisely as they
went in.
The “seniority rule,” a hopeless ob-
stacle to the ambitious among Govern-
ment workers, then denies promotion to
most of them, however well they may
acquit themselves.
If promising candidates only were
selected for such schools, with quick
promotion granted to successful pupils,
the P.M.G, and taxpayers would be far
better off.—P. O. M. (N.S.W.).
Cocktail Referendum
On the way home the other night I
decided to drop off for a quick one, but
was dismayed to find Hebe cruising up-
and down behind the counter with her
shrill formula “Beerzoff!
The following night beer was on, but
you had to “get your own glass.” The
search gave me ample opportunity of
studying a large notice on “How to vote
for ten-o’clock closing,” and another one
assuring me that if this state of affairs
did eventuate it would not mean longer
hours for hotel employees.
“Beerzoff” is, of course, the rule in
many pubs on Saturday afternoons, when
the average moderate drinker, after a
bout in the garden, looks forward to a
“schooner” and a quiet talk. Presumably,
if ten-o’clock closing comes in, the
present inadequate supply will have to
be measured out in coffee cups to cover
the extra four hours, and the “service”
will decline accordingly.
Surely the only justification for the
existence of the brewery and the publi-
can lies in their ability to give service.—
Woodenit (N.S.W.).
“Tackline S,” (B. 1/1 / ’47) favors un-
limited freedom for the sale and con-
sumption of beer. He applauds the
results of such freedom in lands afar, and
tells of the Englishman who is able to
spend all his evenings, Sunday included,
at the pub, and absorb four times as
much beer as his Australian competitor ;
of parents in Holland who commonly
give beer to their babes-in-arms, and of
pubs in pre-war Germany which were
open all night for drink, dance and song.
Of course if these things are desirable,
then any degree of prohibition is a mis-
take. There are, however, many citizens
who think that the place to spend the
evening is the home, that babies are better
without beer, and that all-night night-
life is a sign of moral and mental deca-
dence. There can be no doubt that the
licensed night-life of pre-war Berlin
stank like that of Sodom and Gomorrah ;
that it was fostered and patronised by
Goebbels and his dupes; and that it con-
tributed to the rise of Nazism and the
corruption of the German nation.
If these are the examples we are invited
to follow they seem to threaten rather
than to promise anything in the way of
domestic or public “benefit.”— Pro (S.A.).
The Union Official
I don’t doubt that “Dajarra”*is sincere
in his defence of the union official (B.
22 /1 / ’47), but the Trades Hall is a long,
long way from handling the job. Only
the man on the spot knows how and why
petty grievances grow to major disputes.
A job begins, or a small factory is
started, and as the staff grows to, perhaps,
30, there is sure to be among them the
man who revels in limelight. After a day
or two he starts his campaign: “We ought
to have a rep.—3o men on the job and
no shop steward!”
So far all is well. There is no earthly
reason why a man shouldilt be a member
of a union if he wishes to, nor should
there be any objection to his having a
spokesman on the job. Nobody opposes
the complainant, so, he calls a meeting
in the lunch-hour. Those who are inter-
ested attend, a motion that a shop steward
be appointed is carried, and naturally, the
instigator is elected. Now he has
authority: he is a big man; the union
is behind him and only a “scab” would
oppose his views. To demonstrate his
power he calls fqr a show of cards. And
here it would be interesting to know just
how much of his zeal in hounding non-
unionists off the job and applying the
screws to unfinancial members could be
attributed to union principles and how
much to egotism.
The job “organised,” it is time for
him to look around for grievances. Any
trifle will do so long as he is showing that
he is a man among men. If the manage-
ment opposes him he is happy. He de-
clares : “This is what we want, and if we
don’t get it I’ll call ’em out.”
The irony of it is that he is rarely a
good worker or efficient tradesman, but
once he is elected shop steward he must
not be put off.
All shop stewards, of course, are not
this type ; I’ve worked with some who
were intelligent, level-headed men. A just
cause always found them in support, but
they would never allow foolish grievances
to get out of control.
The worker is not hopeless. Give him
a secret vote and he will be found neither
hopeless nor helpless.—H. C. B. (N.S.W.).
I am compelled to belong to a union.
At a recent union strike-meeting I got
up to nail a deliberate lie spoken by the
secretary and was ruled out of order.
Heads bobbed up all over the hall to
support me, but the loud-mouthed set
up a wail along the corridors and from
leaning positions on the walls. In due
course the ballot material was issued,
and when collected was carted upstairs
for sorting. Then they announced their
count. The strike was on. You could
almost hear it afterwards: “It is God’s
Will.”
There was not a single objection to the
count; not a word was said about the
absence of scrutineers. Hundreds of
Melbourne men went home that night
resigned to a strike and many of them
wore badges of service.
Being an Old Digger, I know that the
Anzac spirit once existed; at present,
however, it is stone dead. Cannot the
blokes from our war, and the latest, form
a combined front against those who run
the unions, and insist on ballots that
are fair? —5 G. R. (Vic.).
When “Trotsky” landed on our dock-
building job he truculently announced that
he was taking oVer as shop steward and
expressed his determination to free the
proletariat from exploitation and enslave-
ment. Day after day he called meetings
and harangued the slaves in an endeavor
to get them to “come out,” but was
beaten on the count every time. He tried
to argue with the boss, and threatened
that before long he would “have ’em all
out.”
After a month of frantic but futile
effort he did the John L. Lewis act.
Bouncing up to the foreman he snorted
“I want me time —me an’ me two cobbers
wouldn’t work with a gang of ‘ruddy
“Get out, you reffo! You've been here a month and still can't pass the
dictation test!”
blabs,’ who cringe under the capitalist’s
lash.” \
I met “Trotsky” the other day and he
offered to buy me a drink. Incidentally,
I am the boss. He was driving a gleaming
new sedan car and was dressed to kill.
“Yair,” he replied in answer to my point-
ing thumb and elevated eyebrows, “I
struck the lottery a coupler munce ago an’
I gotta bisness o’ me own now. Things
is pretty good, too —ya c’n write yer own
price ticket; but labor’s pretty crook —
they won’t work an’ they want the earth.
I don’t know what things is cornin’ to —
they even want award rates—an’ more.”
I mildly suggested that his militancy
seemed to be on the wane. Ajax

Government Sawmills
Some months ago the N.S.W. Forestry
Commission installed a sawmill in the
Tamban State Forest. It was the first
of over thirty to be scattered through-
out the State for the specific purpose of
cutting railway sleepers from sub-stand-
ard logs, and a trade journal described
the set-up as a “modern miracle.”
Although sawmillers were permitted to
inspect the plant, and it was admitted the
capital cost was in the vicinity of £lO,OOO,
the Commission has made no statement
as to production costs. About twenty
men are encamped at the mill site,
where in four months they have
produced about two thousand sleepers.
Three axemen, with equipment costing
less than £2OO, would have done
as well. A quantity of building and
general-purpose timber sawn from waste
has been produced, but this is of very
limited value, the longest length being
eight feet.
Before the Forestry Commission pro-
ceeds with plans to open other mills,
the whole matter should be the subject
of inquiry.— South Creek (N.S.W.).
N.G. Natives
I endorse “Wilydah’s” remarks (B.
8 /1 1 ’47) on elevation in social status of
N.G. boongs. The influence that thought-
less troops in Rabaul had on native wash-
boys became so bad that at one stage
battalion commanders ordered police boys
to patrol unit lines and to march any
would-be washboys “along, calaboose
quicktimfe.” Natives who before the war
had been quite content on their plantation
pay of 6d. per day were then making any-
thing up to 10s. a day for washing clothes.
I was astounded one day to hear a
native headboy from a neighboring village
offer our transport n.c.o. £lOO in N.G.
shillings for a late model Ford, previously
a Nip staff car, which we had on charge,
obviously endeavoring to mimic our
heady-boys in the A.C.T.
Next up the boong unionists will be
striking for double-time on the Sabbath
and a 40-hour week.— Pedite (S.A.).
State of Plenty
Reports that N.S.W. athletes in Perth
(W.A.) for the national championships
bought up quantities of household
soap and cigarette papers to bring back
raises an interesting question concerning
the generous supply of both articles in
W.A., especially as it is odds-on that‘they
are manufactured in the eastern States.
Any reasonably observant visitor to
Perth is struck by the fact that little or
no processing of ordinary household
commodities is carried on there, the labels
on sauces, pickles, jams, etc., indicating
Victoria, N.S.W. or S.A. as their places
of origin, with Victoria leading the field.
Public support for local products seems
to be non-existent, the people apparently
preferring the article which has made a
2000-mile journey to the one made in
the next suburb.
As a result, firms in other States have
a stranglehold on Westralian trade. In
order to retain it and to prevent the de-
velopment of home competition there
they see to it that Westralia gets ample
supplies, even when goods are severely
rationed elsewhere.
A similar state of affairs in the supply
of rationed goods developed in the war
years at Mt. Gambier (S.A.). Because
of its position and affluence the town
benefited by the competition of whole-
salers, who stretched Gambier’s alloca-
tion of available supplies in Melbourne
and Adelaide to capture its trade or pre-
vent the other fellow monopolising it.
The town, with this surfeit of attention,
enjoyed a comparatively comfortable
war.—B. (N.S.W.).


Over the Air
February morning, and I turned on
the wireless with something of the feel-
ings experienced on September 3, 1939.
8.8. C. was in no hurry to enlighten the
listening world as to who was to be our
next Governor-General, the name
being withheld from the summary given
at the beginning of the news. At last
what we had feared in our hearts was
confirmed —Mr. W, J. McKell, on the
advice of the Australian Prime Minister,
had been appointed Governor-General.
The voice of the announcer went
calmly on. I heard him say that the
Prime Minister of Australia had made a
'speech praising Britain’s fight to main-
tain its economic stability, etc. Such
praise being so rare from this quarter, I
was immediately restored to good humor
by the thought that the P.M. had at last
been moved to make a £1,000,000 food
gift to the Mother Country in return for
his nomination of G.-G. being accepted.
But, as usual, the gloomy Chif. only
made use of the occasion to stress the
shortage of dollars; and so another op-
portunity of proving our gratitude was
lost.— Mehi (N.S.W.).
Bushfire Control
Blunderbuss in hand, that “overriding”
writer has taken a pot-shot (B. 29 /1 / ’47)
after skimming the first press reports of
the fires on January 20.
Torquay was not “threatened with
destruction.” Not “thousands of pounds’
worth” but round six houses were de-
stroyed in the whole of Victoria, whereas
hundreds were at imminent risk. Co-
ordination was improved to an extent
which enables us to challenge that cor-
respondent to quote one instance where
efficiency suffered from the lack of it.
“Only a lucky change of wind saved dis-
tricts close to Melbourne” is an absurdity.
“What the whole show lacked is the eyes
of the Air Force”—priceless!
After this last crack our office boy pic-
tures the “overriding authority” as an
air-borne fire brigade, complete with brass
helmets, watering - cans, (over)riding
boots and every gadget mentioned in
“stunt” paragraphs, but lacking the ability
to save one house or crop.
Let us have criticism by all means, but
the contributor to “The Man on the
Land” who emphasised a few weeks ago
the necessity for patrolling at dawn after
burning fire breaks has probably for-
gotten more of the subject of buskfire-
prevention than the other writer will ever
know. —G. G. Sinclair, Secretary, Coun-
try Fire Authority (Vic.).
“Firespotter” has very limited know-
ledge of America if he says Victoria has
little to learn from U.S. methods of
fire-prevention and -control. The “smoke
jumpers” over there are fully equipped to
land in any country. Tall timber is no
obstacle. Douglas firs and redwoods of
California grow to tremendous heights;
and I have seen them just under 400
feet.
The value of the “smoke jumper” is his
ability to arrive at the seat of a fire
shortly after it has started. Getting
ground parties into rough country by
pack-horse may take days. That saving
of time is the vital factor in bushfire
control, and Victoria could save itself
many headaches by adopting the Ameri-
can system in its entirety. It has proved
itself hundreds of times since its incep-
tion.—Wilydah (N.S.W.).

S.A. Children’s Libraries
I recently inspected the S.A. Parlia-
mentary Library and was deeply" im-
pressed by what I saw. I believe no
finer library exists in Australia. It is a
marble hall in every sense of the word,
with library appointments that are per-
fection. The librarian told me that
members were keen readers and that their
literary tastes were high. I have been
there on two occasions since, and each
time the library was deserted. But no-
body will begrudge members their pala-
tial building on that account.
Later I accompanied a friend who was
taking his little girl to a Story Hour at
u-i ChUdren ’ s Library a ramshackle
bunding that was constructed in the
middle of last century."
It seems to me our sense of values is
wrong- Idle it is for us to urge
children to read good books if those
books are housed in dilapidated struc-
ture! What other States have to offer
I know not, but conditions could not be
worse than in the “cultured State.” —A.
Daly (S.A.).
Leprosy
rX! Seychelles medical officer whom
E.S.F. ’ (B. 29 /1 / ’47) quotes as having
that deep injections
ot Chaulmoogra oil coupled with special
diet will cure leprosy in its first and
second stages will have changed his views
in the intervening years if he has kept
up with the literature. of the subject.
Chaulmoogra oil has been known for
centuries in connection with the treat-
ment of leprosy, and the tree, Hydno-
carpus wightiana, from whose seeds the
oil is obtained has been grown in North
Queensland. The oil cannot be taken by
the mouth with safety, and its intra-
muscular injection is liable to produce
dangerous effects. Esters and other de-
rivatives from it ane therefore used in
modern practice. Alepol is the safest
and most effective yeti evolved, but even
with it long and severe reactions some-
times occur. It—not the oil as “E.S.F.”
supposes—is the drug principally used in
African leprosaria at Bunyoni and else-
where.
Manson-Bahr, a world authority on the
subject, has summed up the treatment
question succinctly:
One is very apt to be deceived in esti-
mating the value of a drug in leprosy. The
leper applies for treatment generally during
or soon after one of the periodical exacer-
bations of the disease, and when the nodules
and other eruptions are active and well
pronounced. In the natural course of
events, and without treatment of any de-
scription, especially if the patient be placed
under favorable hygienic conditions, these
acute manifestations tend to become quies-
cent and the disease temporarily to amelior-
ate, This temporary improvement is then
apt to be ascribed to the drug.
Ameliorative treatment is constantly
improving, and recent results from some
“Looks as if were bushed !”
drugs are promising, but, so far, no
specific cure for leprosy has yet been
discovered.— Galenus (Q.).
Visual Education,
“L. 1.” (B. 22/1/’47) has a rather nega-
tive outlook on films in education. The
backward child will always be with us,
so why bother about new methods to
make the average child better?
In point of fact, it is the backward
youngster who benefits most from the use
of motion pictures. Experience has proved
that such children assimilate ideas more
quickly when films are used as an
adjunct to normal training methods,
“L.l'!” speaks of “some children being
in a receptive mood”—others “dull and
unresponsive.” Has he ever seen a child
who was not receptive to a movie show?
The views of American educationists
and of the British Ministry of Education
are at variance with “L.l.’s” theory. The
former have long used films with good
effect, and the British authorities an-
nounced this month an intensification of
their programme for using films through-
out Great Britain. During the war the
Services used films wherever possible for
technical and tactical training, and for
morale purposes.—N. B. (N.S.W.).
Regenerated' Binghi
In the general attack in Melbourne on
the Federal Government’s methods of
dealing with the abo. there is at least one
man who can speak from personal experi-
ence —H. E. Thonemann, part-owner of
Hodgson Downs station and of Elsey,
immortalised by Mrs. TEneas Gunn in We
of the Never Never.
On Elsey a long-term experiment
has been conducted to see if Binghi can
be regenerated. Seventy natives depend
on the station. They are free to go on
walkabout if they feel the urge. They
get food, tobacco and clothes and can
work if they wish. Their gins are
encouraged to have piccaninnies, and the
piccaninnies are sure of security when
they come into the world.
An anthropologist who visited the
station said they looked happy and con-
tented. As evidence the black-baby
bonus and post-maternity benefits on
Elsey have increased the population four-
fold in seven years. Elsey managers
know the tribal customs, and are not
feared by the abos.
It is men like Thonemann who should
be made protectors of the abos, not some
civil servant who knows nothing about
them. Thonemann was one-time M.L.A.
for Toorak. —M. G. (Vic.).
Darwin
“J.L.” (B. 25/12/’46) accuses Army
personnel of looting and wanton destruc-
tion of private homes. As the material
taken from these homes was used in the
construction of slit trenches, ammunition
dumps and gun-pits, this accusation is
incorrect and unjust.
In those days when bombing obtained
and invasion was threatened, a well-pro-
tected gun-pit or ammo dump was far
more important than private property,
which was likely to be blown to pieces at
any time and to serve no other purpose
than to provide a fire and guide the next
wave of bombers in, a not unusual oc-
currence.
All commandeering was carried out
under the supervision of an officer, only
essential materials being taken. Strict
orders against looting, involving heavy
penalties, were issued and pickets were
detailed to see they were carried out. An
examination of the old slit-trenches,
ammo dumps and gun-pits will provide
ample evidence of the truth.—W. X.
(W.A.).
A Policy of Despair
Having read “Sweat’s” par. on the use
Of machines (B. 15/1/’47), I reported
this morning to the gravel-pit as usual,
only to be told by the foreman that he
would have to stand my truck down for
half a day. Because of increased unem-
ployment it had been decided .not to use
the tractor scoops and loading ramp.
Only men with shovels were to be em-
ployed and I had to wait for a “pick-
up” at the Labor Bureau.
I was reminded of an old story. A
man, watching mechanical scoops at
work, exclaimed, “There, now. If
they used shovels on that job they
could employ a hundred men.” “Ay,”
agreed the village idiot, who was standing
by, “and if they used tablespoons they’d
employ a thousand.”—B. J. L. (Q.).
Landlord and Tenant
Things are certainly tough on the
house-owner who, because of war-time
conditions, was forced to let his
home to someone while he or she went
on a war job, and who now wants to get
the home back.
I know a case where the owner gave
the tenant friendly notice in July
that he wanted the house and got the
usual answer. He served official notice on
September 19, then took court proceed-
ings at the expiration of the two months
required. The hearing was listed for

Export Wine
“Two men passed with packages under
their arms, and coat collars turned up.
‘Only Australian burgundy,’ said one,
‘That’s all I could get, and not cheap at
that.’ ” So goes an extract from “A
Christmas Day in the Workhouse,” an
article in “Courier, 1 ' one of the best-
produced British magazines to survive
the war. But “only' Australian bur-
gundy”! Won’t they ever learn about
our wines!
It is twelve months since Alan More-
head. toured the wine-growing States —-
perhaps too early to see any benefit from
his publicity." I’m not suggesting a ban
on adverse propaganda ; 1 m suggesting
that overseas customers be educated to
say with pride, “Australian burgundy, the
best I could get, and cheap at twice the
price.” The job lies with the Australian
Wine Board, trade channels and over-
seas publicity departments. If our wine
is as good as the experts say, then it
should not be an impossible job. A news
item this week shows that at least they
are trying:
The Federal Viticultural Council intends
to ask the Commonwealth to allot a quarter
of a million pounds of accumulated excise
duty for home and overseas publicity pur-
poses. These accumulated funds from
which wine bounties were paid are to be
absorbed by general revenue, after allowing
for a reserve to meet the uncertainties of
the industry, when the Bounty Act expires
next month.
If granted, £250,000-worth of publicity
would do a lot to help the industry.
Publicity for our wines both overseas and
in Australia should undergo a thorough
examination and it may be found that
an entirely new approach is necessary.—

The R.A.N.
The recent promotion of only one
lieut.-commander of the executive branch
from some 40 Feut.-commanders in the
zone cannot be allowed to pass without
comment.
The chance of the youngster joining
as a cadet-midshipman of attaining com-
mander’s rank is to all intents and pur-
poses nil. If he behaves himself — e.g.,
does not blot his copybook unduly—all
he can look forward to is being thrust out
into the uncharitable world at 45 with no
prospects, bar the possible secretaryship
of a golf club.
The whole system of entry of officers
to the executive branch is out of date and
uneconomic. A boy passes in (to do so
he must possess brain and brawn in a
high degree, as competition is keen) at 13,
when he does not in many cases know
his own mind. He spends four years at
the Royal Australian Naval College,
during which time he does precisely tne
subjects he could do as well at a public
school or a technical college. Some sea-
manship is included in the college curricu-
lum. It may not be realised that this
training costs the taxpayer £5OOO for
each cadet.
Under the special-entry scheme for
cadets the candidate enters at 17, hav-
ing completed his schooling in the or-
dinary way. At 17 he knows his own
mind, or should do, and so is better able
to judge for himself the advantages or
otherwise of a naval career.
The same democratic principle applies
as in the case of the 13-year-old—that is
to say, any boy from whatever walk in
life has an equal chance.
The did idea of “catch ’em young”
should be abandoned in these modern
times; the Americans realised this long
ago.
The difficulty as I see it is that too
many senior officers still think in terms
of masts and yards, forgetting that the
sole purpose of a mast today is to carry
radar equipment. The late war exploded
a lot of ideas. While the traditions to
which the Navy and the Empire owe so
much should be cherished, drastic
changes must be made in some direc-
tions. This is particularly so in regard
to uniform and routine if the supply of
the right type of personnel is to be main-
tained.
That changes are necessary and long
overdue has been realised by the
Office, and it is to be hoped that those
in power in the Senior Service will follow
suit. *
Jack Tar is a grand chap, as I know
from personal experience, but he cannot
and will not be handled as he was 20
years ago. Nothing is static in this world
of ours. Everything moves at a faster
tempo than it did in former years.
While it is realised that naval authorities
have their difficulties, they will get no-
where if they maintain their present
policy, which seems to be one of “mark
time.” Twenty-five Years’ Service
