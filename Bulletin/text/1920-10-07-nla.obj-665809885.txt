THE MOUTH THE GATEWAY for DISEASE.
Scientists have proved conclusively that no fewer
than 36 different infections may be traced to the
human mouth as a starting point. The mouth thus
being the gateway for the entrance of disease, it
is here that precautions are most necessary.
Hudson’s Eumenthol
Jujubes
Are the most powerful, * safe and pleasant Germi-
cide and Antiseptic known. Being destructive to
all organisms which give rise to infectious diseases,
they keep the mouth in a sweet, healthy condition.
The Lancet (London) states“ Their purpose is to
act as a bactericide in the mouth. This result is
likely to be gained, for in the experiments tried
Eumenthol Jujubes proved to be as effective bae-
tericidally as is creosote.”

t < ht.r?. t ' i. d ’ , tU! ’ what was ihore, it used
: ? a - 11 , l ? bkely that the historian of the
, “ u h ’ estimating our age with complete
detachment, will lay much of the blame for
I ° US am ; eSt which characterises it
* t the doois ot those who, getting temporary
command o! tremendous Vgekpons, failed to
in C>U l l? th dl «cretion. In the Comrnon-
.iw-ii 1 - the time, about 25 months
after all immediate danger from Germany has
vanished, we have the spirit of absolutism
peimeating the whole framework of Gov-
ernment. No social activity is so trifling as
to be sate from the interference of the cen-
trai administration, which is to say. the
t rime Minister; as was evidenced interest-
mgiy the other day when the promoters of
a. backblocks concert were warned that the
phraseology of their programme had dis-
pleased .Mr. Hughes, and that they would
repeat the offence at their peril. The-heads
of the great departments follow ,the auto-
cratic line laid down by their chief, and their
subordinates imitate them. As railway trav-
ellers or consignees, as users of the tele-
phone, in all their operations as citizens of
Commonwealth and State, the people are
made to feel the bludgeoning hand of autho-
nty. Hence, resentment against the State,
which at its best takes the form of some-
thing a long way short of national patriot-
ism a nd at the worst is Bolshevism.
Mr. Cole’s cure is what is known here as
decentralisation. In no other way can the
inhabitants of a continent such as Austra-
lia be made articulate. And by no other
means will the majority of them secure their
rights. The curious position in which \V.
A. Watt found himself when he reached
London recently is chronic in the case of
most of our M.P.’s, the difference being that
the latter, in consideration of the emolu-
ments, take it more philosophically. Like
\\ att they are appointed to do certain speci-
fied things in a far city by an authority
which remains at home. It is impossible
for a Parliamentary representative to get
from the electors instructions carrying him
over all the circumstances that may arise
between one Parliament and* another: it was
impossible for Watt to apply to the problems
which faced him in London the mind of
Hughes in Melbourne. The tendency of the
M.l\, and more especially the newly-elected
M.P., is to disregard the known wishes of
the country. *A cynical example was the
late Federal salary-grab, admittedly exe-
cuted behind the backs of the people because
the people would never have countenanced
it. Those most concerned —that is, the tax-
payers—cannot interfere under the present
system. In Watt’s case the delegating autho-
rity did interfere, and so vehemently that the
representative decided the billet wasn’t
worth the worry and humiliation. Now this
sort of interference—necessarily unin-
structed as regards the immediate facts of
the situation —may be more malign in its
effects than no control at all. Decentralisa-
tion, or the small State system—“functional
democracy," to use Mr. Cole’s phrase—offers
the golden mean. Many observers must at
different times have watched the clock-work
smoothness and efficiency with which various
small social organisations work, and won-
dered why the methods which actuate them
so satisfactorily couldn’t be applied to the
State. For years the Melbourne Club was
a case in point. The members are no better
as citizens than the next jive or six hundred
\ ictorians who do not belong to a club. But,
m addition to finding a capable executive,
the club has a device by which the wishes
of its members may be expressed practically
from day to day. The whole of Australia
may resent Mr. Hughes’s retention of the
War Precautions Act. But so long as he
can show a Parliamentary majority of even
one vote —not a difficult thing when, it is
remembered that his defeat on a party issue
must mean the loss of £2O a week to many
of the members—so long can he defy the will
of the people who are theoretically his
masters. If tin* secretary of the Melbourne
Club inflicted inferior ham or stale fish* on
his constituents, he would hear about it
the same day, and if the offence were per-
sisted in he would go. Not only do clubs
enjoy this right of the recall—practically
never exercised for the simple reason that it
is there —but they' also possess the initia-
tive : and this being an instrument which is
not allowed to lie idle, they exercise it in
all sorts of ways from the construction or
abolition of a garden down to the taking
in of a new* magazine. The City States
of the Old World were real democracies, just
as well-run clubs, are, for the reason that
they were sufficiently compact for every citi-
zen to be able to make himself heard in
them. In so far as a civilised community is
denied that right it is suspicious and resent-
ful, and in' so far as it is given full opportuni-
ties in the matter discontent is undermined.
Social Theory lays down no rules. The
writer is satisfied to present his ideas as
suggestions rather than as concrete plans. But
as every man must see something of himself
in “The Egoist,’’ so every modern State has
a lesson to learn from such a work as this.
As a text-book for those aspiring to govern
a virile, questioning race like that which
inhabits Australia, a people impatient of
restraint and quick to discern official hum-
jug and vanity, it is of very great value.
South African Verse
In Gold Dust from South African Poetry,
selected by E. H. Crouch (A. C. Fifield,
London), we have 43 pieces of verse by a
number of writers. There is among it very
little essential poetry, and the general qual-
ity of the matter is not high, while glaring
crudities appear on every second page; but
color and atmosphere make the collection
attractive, in spite of all defects. Here is a
beginning, and, though artistically it is a
meagre beginning, the promise of real voices
interpreting Africa.
A good deal of the verse is Kipling-
inspired, and that is a pity ; for the imita-
tors of Kipling catch his easy swing, his
carelessness of all the niceties of rhythm
and rhyme, his rather cheap method of
getting an effect, but never the subtle feeling
and fine suggestion that give him his force.
This sample is by “Author unknown”:
East and west and south and north from the days
of the dawn till now,
Ere the grass was. burned, or sod was turned by the
share of the furrowing plow,
This was the tune of the tattered tilt, the song of
the straining span,
How the disselboom points out the Doom that has
given the earth to man.
The “Pace of 1 lie Ox,” by Cullen Gouldsbury,
has an idea, though it is probably untrue:
The song of the ships is far to hear, the hum of
the world is dead,
And lotus-life in a drowsy year our benison instead—
Why should we push the world along, live in a whirl
of flame,
When the pare of the Ox is steady and strong, and
the end is just the same?
“The Red Cloud,” by Kingsley Fairhridge,
strains its metre badly, but paints a picture:
Know ye the Bed Cloud—Red Cloud of Afric—■
Endless, unfathom’d, unceasing, borne on the
warm wind ;
'Whelming the corn and fruit-land, farm and rick,
With the green veld before it, and the brown
veld behind.
And this, by the same author; on “Bongwi”
(the baboon), is vivid and forceful, but not
distinguished :
A haunted soul put under ban,
A hunted beast that has to roaui,
The voiceless image of a man
With neither speech nor home —
Upon the summit of the height,
Where only wind-swept lichens grow,
Bongwi, lit by the dawning-light,
Watches the plains below.
Fierce eyes, low brow, protruding mouth,
Short bands that twitch and twitch again.
The hairy gargoyle of the south—
A man without a brain j
Upon the highest krantz lie waits
Dim-lit by golden streaks of dawn,
Guarding the interests of his mates
Who wreck the fields of corn.
Far down the mealie-gardens lie,
And he a patient sentinel
. Shouts “Bo<sV-hoom! ” to th' offended sky
To show that all is well.
The animal does not seem to be “voiceless,”
after all; but the verse is interesting. Fair-
bridge has much to say about animals.
Ingwi. the Uopard, stalks in “Yellow Eyes” ;
and Shumba, the lion, does very vivid hunt-
ing :
A leap—a scream—a thud;
And it was done. N
Silence' awhile, and the liof smell of blood.
Silence, then slowly, with the sinking sun,
The rend of flesh.... The crickets awake and sing,
The frogs take up their song, the night-jars wing
Weird in the azure dusk. As had been willed.
Chance brought him food; and Fate has been fulfilled.
But there are some things of very differ-
ent quality. Amy Sutherland wrote this:
My sweetheart’s hair is yellow, bright
As the sun in yonder sky;
And shy my sweetheart is, and Uurk
The place where she does lie.
Then drink to the glittering gold!
Drink to the wealth untold!
Drink deep and long, with laughter and song,
Drink, drink to the glittering gold !
w. Blanc lias the remarkable line:
For never prospector had ever a home.
W. C. Scully achieved this:
Sweet orchids, in shadow reposing,
Sigh scents on the path of the bee;
Brigiit lilies in splendor enclosing
Woo butterflies over the lea. ‘
And Albert Brodrick sings :
Oh! the days gone by, when we had no gold
And our hearts were true and had not grown cold.
There is a good deal that pleases; very
little that charms. Much of it should neve*r
have been printed, much less selected to
represent the literary heights attained by a
continent. Comparisons are evil things and
easily misunderstood; but a very safe com-
ment on the volume is that, except for about
a hundred lines, the vast waste-paper baskets
of Australia could furnish a better antho-
logy. Whether the selection is representa-
tive of South Africa or not is a question
between the South Africans and E. H.
Crouch.
How History is Written
Nothing is so likely to make you shiver as
the proofs which occasionally turn up of the
utter unreality of what are known as
“historical facts.’" You take the account,
stated in all good faith, of some incident
reported in yesterday’s newspaper. Yet if
you cross-examined the witnesses you would
get a different account from each bystander,
some of them being ludicrously inaccurate.
When it comes to writing a history, based on
the opinons of ntfen long since dead, of bygone
heroes who are surrounded bv obvious myths,
the chronicler generally picks out “the facts’’
that best suit his own preconceived notions,
and calmly lets the rest of the story sink
into oblivion. Stephen Leacock verv wittilv
did this the other day, and. pretending that
he believed the half-truths about Charles 11..
gave that as the whole story, and so made
him out a very pretty fellow indeed
When we take up Portraits of the ’ Eighties ,
by Horace G. Hutchinson, we are inclined
to be thankful that our eyes are old enough
to detect some, at any rate, of the grave
errors. He is a very good specimen of tfie
man-about-town, probably called himself a
Liberal because his father and grandfather
did it, went to the ’Varsity, was a sort of
amateur champion at golf and became quite

A Remarkable Test
of the New Edison
proves that there is not the slightest
difference between the natural voice and its
Re-Creation by this remarkable instrument,
The amazing and daring test of actually comparing the human voice with
the New Edison Re-creation has been successfully carried out before
audiences of over two million people.
In such a huge number even the most captious critics have been compelled
to admit that no human ear can detect a shade of difference between the
two renditions.
As a result one never tires of the New Edison —the novelty never wears off
any more than the novelty wears of “Pagliacci,” “Aida” or any other great

Exploration.
Nine days beyond my dream the sun went
down
On waterless pale wastes forlorn of trees.
I looked upon my lean hands hard and
brown,
My burned and bleeding feet, my naked
knees;
And there was laughter in me, cracked and
vain,
To feel my greatness singing through my
pain.
Beyond the utmost knowledge of the years
I had passed on and on and yet could live.
The narrow fields where men had tilled their
fears
Had wine and bread and heavy sleep to
give;
B\it I, the great path-finder, was the first
To cross the frontiers of the world of thirst.
The darkness fell and reigned without a star;
Black, deep and cloudless was the hot, still
sky.
God and His angels seemed so very far
To reach them I had yet ten deaths to
die.
Still could I dare and die them one by one
If but to-morrow brought me back the sun.
All night the slow sand breathed below my
soul;
The winds had all gone by on other ways;
Only the desert moved to some dry goal,
Creeping and creeping through the darks
and days
With a vast listlessness so slow and wide
I could not sleep for envy of its pride.
The sun half-rose, winked once and dropped
black out.
I stood erect. I walked. I cried aloud.
In all that nothingness one splendid doubt
Lived on and trembled; one high thought
unbowed,
Stumbled through death to death and know-
ledge still —
My own unalterable, eager will.
At noon of weariness I paused to rest;
At eve of pain I lay upon the sand;
At dawn of hot despair’s unending quest
I groped with fumbling feet across the
land.
No soul should follow here. This vast, dry
sea
Beyond all thought was mine of agony.
By long, dull sweeps of darkness judging
time,
I had passed twenty days beyond the sun.
The great pains grinding in my bones their
rhyme
Sang to my thick, slow blood of triumph
won.
Then something moved. I sank with a great
cry
To the black earth. That something was
not I.
A moving something. I was not alone.
The triumph of my bitter march was gone;
My tears fell hot upon the desert stone.
My pride was humbled —and the great sun
shone!
Half-blinded in the bitter glare I sat
And saw, still marching on, God’s lean grey
rat.

When Jim rode off the other day
We’d had a quarrel, Jim and I;
And, somehow, “sorry’s” hard to say.
We parted with the quarrel high ;
The thought at first brought no dismay,
But after Jim had gone away
I wished to God I’d said “Goodbye” !
The day had gone when Jim drew near
(How had I waited, fear beset!) ;
His cheery call, “Where are you, dear?”
Gladdened my very heart: and yet
I called —my voice was hard and clear—
“Be careful! Don’t bring mud in here!”
God! That I could so soon forget!

Moon-Love.
I am the lover of the moon,
And when she sails serene and high
I don a pair of fairy shoon
And scale the tall stair of the sky;
Upon a pearly cloud we rest,
My hot head pillowed on her breast,
And watch the world go by.
ft
The earth spins round far, far below,
With here a thousand points of light,
Where restless cities throb and glow
Beneath the mantle of the night;
And there a patch of soft warm dark
Where lovers cuddle in a park
And dreaming lawns are white.
And now it is the sea that sleeps
A hundred hundred miles away,
With big-eyed fishes in its deeps
And misty clumps of weed asway;
And little ships like coon’s eyes roll,
While foam gleams white on wave and shoal
Because moon kisses stray.
The soft vague miles of hill and tree
Drowse peacefully beneath her glance;
And furtive things go fast and free
Where slender saplings nod and dance,
And old dreams live among the leaves
Which her mad magic chastely weaves
To patterns of romance.
The moon and I in sweetest bliss
Behold the world that swiftly goes,
And gloat on it and laugh and kiss,
And kiss again when sweet there flows
From some far garden where love sings
An elfin breeze on scented wings—
The deep breath of a rose !

ALL THAT HANGS ON MILLEN.
“It is understood that Japan will insist on racial
equality at the Geneva Convention in November. The
opinion is expressed that Canada will take an im-
portant part in the discussion and will be hostile
to Japan’s proposal.” —Some more warnings by cable.
Something of this sort comes along now
almost daily, for the time for the trial of
White Australia’s case is very near. The
question of our right to shut out colored
immigrants, no matter how the shutting out
may be disguised under educational or other
tests, has never been decided —only hung
up or “taken to avizandum,” as a Scotch
■Judge says when he can’t make up his mind.
When the nations put their heads together
at Paris the consensus of opinion was that
hardly anybody cared for White Australia
enough to fight for it —certainly not nations
like France, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Hol-
land, which have no empty lands to attract
Brown Brother. By a majority, but not
a sufficient one, it was held that the white-
ness of Australia was not an Australian
matter but an international one for the
League to decide. Apparently our right
not to let Japanese in is our affair, but our
right to shut Japanese out is Japan’s affair.
As the two can’t be told apart the view was
that Australia could have a voice in the
matter as a member of the League, but not
otherwise. Britain’s position apparently is
that it thinks White Australia a foolish dog-
in-the-mangerish affair, seeing that this
country is making no visible progress, or
very little, in settling its splendid tropical
estate on which the question mostly hangs.
If Australia wanted the North to nut white
men, and especially white freeholders, in,
all J. Bull’s respect for the rights of pro-
perty and the laws of trespass might be
roused. If Australia only wants the North
that it may keep brown men out, it is a
different proposition. The Cold Country
doubtless dislikes the appearance of bring-
ing pressure to bear on a white son to oblige
a brown stranger, even though he may be
a sort of ally; but, then, the Cold Country
has brown sons of its own who argue against
us, and they call for consideration. Even if
theif mental calibre is small and their pedi-
gree mixed, and their turbans untidy, their
numbers are tremendous. Nothing has hap-
pened since heads were put together at Paris
to improve our case for the whiteness of the
North ; in fact, the breakdown at Darwin,
after amazing sums had been spent on the
purchase of cocked hats and brasshats for
the Territory, will rather tell against us
if the League has heard of it. The United
States won’t be represented this time to give
us -its rather qualified support. Its school-
masterly President, the wisest fool in Chris-
tendom vice James Stuart deceased, has
definitely bungled it out of the movement.
And Millen will not be the equal of
Hughes in making the best of a weak case.
* * * •
How the South American States which
count will stand if they come into the dis-
cussion is not too sure. The South African
Union will probably be mildly friendly, not
that it hopes to be white (having been born
black and whiteness being past praying
for), but because it has enough colored races
already and some to spare. If the straight
and chivalrous Botha had been alive its
course would have been fairly easy to fore-
cast. But Botha is dead, and Smuts, with
all his brains and courage and military skill,
has a grey and rat-like quality. And it is
pleasing to know that Canada has decided
views—the same sort as ours. Unfortunately
the positions don’t agree like the views.
Canada’s west coast, the one convenient to
Asiatic immigration, is very short, while our
north coast is very long. The Province of
British Columbia answers to Australia’s
Northern Territory or North Queensland in
being a desirable land and a handy gateway
from Asia to the regions beyond, ’ but there
the resemblance ends. There are railways
across the continent to show that possession
is permanent and faith is.strong, while Aus-
tralia’s transcontinental is in the air, as it
has always been. The population of British
Columbia (about 400,000) has more than
doubled in 16 years and that ot its capital
city has more than trebled. Its biggest city,
quite unlike Darwin, has 170,000 people,
which means that it has multiplied its popula-
tion sixfold in 16 years. The adjacent pro-
vince of Alberta is growing fast, in con-
trast to the sluggishness of North Queens-
land and the backsliding of the Northern.
Territory. Canada’s natural answer to the
brown applicant, as regards its own Pacific
province—the gateway which all the fuss is
about —is that it is using the land itself and
filling it up at such a pace that it will soon
want it all. In fact, it will say that there
is no room, or will soon be none, for brown
applicants, much as it would like to take
them in. In giving an opinion on Australia’s
case, however, it will probably say that the
spectacle of a fertile empty land that is
growing emptier even in its infancy is quite
outside its experience, and that the right of
a people to keep others out when it doesn’t
seriously go in itself and apparently doesn’t
mean to is hard to decide for lack of pre-
cedent. As to whether a White Tropical
Australia is a delusion that ought to be
squashed by reason of its folly the Canadian
verdict will probably be that the only nation
which says the thing is possible refuses to
supply the only possible evidence. So the posi-
tion is doubtful in the extreme. In short, the
Dominion may support Australia’s views on
colored immigration for a time at least as a
matter of self-interest, but it will probably
regard this country as an amiable lunatic
just the same. Other States may regard it
as a lunatic, but having no self-interest in the
matter may withhold the support.
* * * *
Canada used to suffer from the Empty
West disease iust as badly as Australia does
from the Empty North; for it isn’t tropical
warmth that makes emptiness—Arctic chill
has a much greater influence that way. If
it had been governed like Australia, its West
would almost certainly be a void even yet,
and it would have no better answer to the
Jap than we have. But there were differ-
ences in policy. It put apart its great
desert, which is about the same size as Aus-
tralia’s, only frost-bitten instead of drought-
smitten, as a Territory ruled by a Commis-
sioner, and didn’t hamper its live States
with odd bits of the incubus. It recognised
early that population centres round a poli-
tical capital, so it laid out new States in
quick succession, and cut them fairly small,
and population came. People gathered
there just as they gathered round Perth,
Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane,
and just as they would gather round Rock-
hampton, Townsville, Cairns, Darwin, Wynd-
ham or any other old place with the same
attractions. The attraction may be un-
reasonable, but it exists and has to be
reckoned with. The four newest Provinces
of the Dominion, helped by such a railway
as North Australia seems as if it would
never get, increased their census returns by
from 100 to 500 per cent, between 1901 and
1911. Capitals are at fairly even distances
right across the Dominion, whereas in Aus-
tralia the area in which five of the
seven of them are situated could be
sawn off the map and the absence of
the section be hardly noticed. Tropical
Australia consists of three neglected sub-
colonies governed by telegraph from places
as much as 1500 or 2000 miles away. Man
doesn’t live, neither do vegetables grow, by
telegram, and the baby that gets its bottle
by long-distance wire doesn’t flourish. It is
the perfection of absentee ownership and the
apotheosis of the big estate, and it is always
the outer fringe of the big estate and the
place furthest out of the sight and out of the
mind of the absentee that fares worst. When
Australia is politically broken up for closer
settlement as Canada was (though the
Dominion might have carried the idea further
with advantage), it may expect the same
results. Meanwhile Senator Millen has
to explain that a land which even white
Australian politicians won’t work in (they
won’t work within 400 miles of it) is an
ideal country, and that the fewer people
there are in a place the better is the claim
to it by right of settlement. Australia wishes
him luck, for the fate of nations and pos-
terity and the destiny of the white race may
hang on him.
THE GATHERING CLOUD.
More and more it becomes eviderit that the
vague thing Bolshevism is not going to be
quarantined within the borders of Eastern
Europe. In one form or another it seems
likely to spread everywhere. A little over
a century ago Rousseau wrote: —
Power must be purified from all violence... .In
wealth no citizen should be rich enough to purchase
another citizen, nor poor, enough to sell himself. If
you wish to make the State durable you must allow
neither opulence nor want.
This theory, which was the basis of the
“Social Contract,” had been stated 22 cen-
turies earlier by Plato in his “Republic.”
It is still working overtime wherever a few
revolutionaries are gathered together; and
because it is ethically so admirable it can
never perish. But, in practice, it is probably
impossible of realisation. It produced the
French Revolution and the Commune, which
between them shed oceans of working-class
blood, and, after all, left opulence side by-
side with want, and the violence of power
in far better working order than before.
It was no more profitable to the poor that
the Rothschilds should have the money in
place of the Bourbons ; that an emperor
should order them into the firing-line in place
of a king. In Russia the workers have gone
through unparalleled anguish, only to find
that they are poorer and under the sway of
a more violent band of despots than at any
time in their country’s history. Every
country gets pretty much the sort of revolu-
tion it deserves, and Britain is in no danger
of the Calvary which Russia has had to
tread. But it is in for its changes, too.
When George Eliot wrote “Felix Holt” it
was possible for a man by moving from one
of the midland counties of England to the
south to live as a stranger for many years.
And the social lives of the nations were
similarly hidden from each other's eyes.
To-day the cable and the cheap newspaper
show the whole world to each literate
inhabitant of it at breakfast every morning.
This means that the new ideas which
are arriving in Continental Europe must
pass on to England, as they did in the second
quarter of last century. The notion of any-
thing so crude as expropriation, either in
cash or kind, may be dismissed as absurd.
That is a policy which made a temporary
appeal to the mOujik mind of Russia, but
which plainly did not strike even the by
no means over-cultivated intellects of the
Italian proletariat as practicable. What-
ever forced industrial change occurs will
be effected by an intensification of the
strike curse, which is already limiting the
prosperity and comfort of every individual
citizen. The Russian had to go in for a
sort of Slave Revolt, the Italians to become
burglars first and blackmailers afterwards.
The Englishman brandishes a more formid-
able weapon than either of them in the
shape of his union organisation—more for-
midable because it enables him to hold out
in a way that an Italian operative, starving
amidst the plenty of a factory which he and
his friends are unable to work, has no hope
of doing.
But the trouble frpm which the British
community is suffering consists in the fact
that the union leaders have no clear idea
of the ultimate use to which their weapon
is to be put. In a short-sighted spirit they
have regarded it hitherto as a mere wage-
raising, hour-shortening instrument. Its
futility from this aspect is a matter of the
notorious incapacity of raised wages per se
to do any real good to the majority of
workers. Thoroughly appreciating the force
of that truth, the insurrectionists are con-
cerned to push up wages by endless demands
to the inevitable breaking-point: exploiting
the union organisation, in fact, to destroy
the institution which gives it life. That
cannot jje * the meaning and destined end
of the new era in the eyes of the sane
worker —the worker with family ties and a
sense of proportion, as against the embit-
tered waster who de.sires spoliation and even
bloodshed because they appear to him more
agreeable than effort. An essen-
tial, if British industry —and that means the
British nation—is to survive, is stability.
This involves a number of things, but chiefly
toil executed by men whose hearts are in
the job. It may be that the time has come
to give all employees a status approximating
to that which they possess as citizens. Obvi-
ously under any system where the workers
in a given concern have a voice and interest
in the management, the handicap to produc-
tion of vexatious strikes and of movements
for ever-shorter hours will be reduced.
Is that the object which the reasonable
workers have in view? If so it is only a
matter of devising the machinery, and in
that work they would have the willing aid
of the best and brainiest members of the
employing classes. Already in some of the
most vitaj matters the alleged capitalist no
longer owns his own industries. Wages,
hours of labor, working conditions and so
forth are all fixed for him by either a
Court or a Parliament representing the
sovereign people. It would be a short step
to an arrangement giving every employee a
share in the dividends, and. even a vote in
the administration; and if it meant peace
and so continuous output, the change would
more than pay. The British worker is
already three centuries ahead of Russia and
at least one ahead of Southern Europe as
regards the ordinary amenities of life. But
he may answer that his trouble is more
spiritual than material; that just as the
slavery of Athens and Sparta had to come
as an improvement on the barbarian prac-
tice of slaughtering prisoners of war, and
that just as servage had to replace slavery
and the wage-system servage, so now the
time is at hand when every man must be
enabled to work for himself. And, indeed,
so far as any note of sanity has emerged
from the wild Russian jangle it is that
note; or at least a hint of it. But the
workers will have to become articulate on
the question. At present one large section
is madly chasing round a circle made up
of raised wages and H.C.L.. while another
talks liahtly of “wiping out capital,” mean-

THE TRIBE OF IKEY McROOK.
Sydney is one large benevolent asylum for
bookmakers, one-horse battlers, ticktackers,
tale-tellers and their dull and unproductive
kind. In proportion to population, no other
city in the world supports such a profusion
of racecourse idlers or finds oats and chaff
for so many futile and thick-winded squibs
with four feet. For the Novice Handicap
at one of the suburban meetings recently
GO alleged horses were entered. Each of
these saddening beasts represents an outlay
ot at least £3 10s. a week. It costs that
and more, to feed, bed, rug, physic and stable
the brutes, to muck out their stables and
nde them on the training-track, and provide
nomination and acceptance fees, and pay for
losing mounts. Quite 50 persons, who might
be laying bricks or sitting behind reapers and
binders are kept fully employed iii looking
after these 00 disastrous animals. And yet
nine-tenths of the ungainly prads will never
win a race. They are too stunted for farm-
work and haven’t stamina enough for the
cab. They are worthless as buggy-horses,
and from such of them as aren’t geldings—
most of them are—it would be a crime to
breed. They are useless even for the ignoble
purpose which they are supposed to serve
community, which has to find
±l~,OOO or ±13,000 a year for their mainten-
ance (without reckoning the cash value of
the labor fruitlessly expended in attending to
the lamentable steeds), would be better off
if it cut their throats. In that case the
hides would bring in a few pounds, and
there is a small but steady demand for hor«e-
meat at the Zoo.
The Government Statistician should be
asked to take a census of (1) the horses
and ponies in training within the area of
Greater Sydney, and (2) the persons wholly
engaged in valeting or otherwise minister-
ing to them, in the course of a year. The
number of races in which the quadrupeds
started and the exact proportion (it must be
pitifully small) of place-getters should also
be shown. Extending the field of inquiry an
attempt might be made to arrive at the'cost
of keeping the unplaced majority in action,
assuming that it takes a trainer, a jockey
and two stable-hands to look after a string
of four, and not forgetting that for every
unproductive horse in training there is an
unproductive bookmaker with an unproduc-
tive clerk. It would probably be impossible
to enumerate the tipsters, runners, whis-
perers, lug-biters, battery-fakers, dope-com-
pounders and the rest of the graceless mob
who “live on the game,” but even with this
section eliminated an official investigation
would be able to demonstrate that a large
number of alleged horses and a still larger
number of horsey persons are mere idle para-
sites and cumberers of the ground. The
sport would be sweeter, and the community
richer, if the quadrupeds were poleaxed and
the bipeds compelled to do some useful toil.
There are men who race for the love of the
thing, and of whom it can be said without
mockery that they are helping the horse-
breeding industry along. Besides assisting
to provide the public with sport, they and
their employees may conceivably render it
some economic service. But the one-horse
battler and his tribe are of no utilitarian
benefit whatever. Their lamentable busi-
ness is a degradation of spoi't, and their
melancholy chaff-eaters do the horse-breed-
ing industry a sight more harm than good.

If Tommy Mcßook' didn’t exist the battler
would have to look for work. So long as
Mcßook flourishes the battler can indulge
himself (or his chaff-merchant) with the
hope of finding a punter who will back
Sudden Death for the Gunners’ Handicap
and lay him the odds to a pony, or of strang-
ling Sudden Death in Mcßook’s interest
when the public has made it favorite. The
tote can’t do these things. The tote doesn’t
stiffen horses, nor does it support a motley
mob of loafers who ought to be swinging axes
or soldering jam-tins. It doesn’t require the
withdrawal from fruitful avocations of a
horde of able-bodied and leather-lunged citi-
zens ; it can be worked by clerks and t.vpistes
in their spare time. Where, as in Westralia,
it exists side by side with the bookmaker,
it gives the punter a better return for his
money, and where, as in Maoriland and S.
Australia, it is the only legal form of bet-
ting, the racing is clean and sportsmanlike,
and it is not overdone. In N. S. Wales and
Victoria, the bookmaker-ridden States, over-
racing has become a curse. There are too
many racecourses and too many racehorses:
too many sporting loafers and too much of
the rascality by which they are marked. And
the bookmaker is principally responsible.
The whole rotten system revolves round
Mcßook'. Abolish this expensive parasite
and a multitude of other parasites, equally
useless and even more sinister, would follow
him into oblivion. He is not only a loafer
himself but is the cause of loafing in others.
Having kicked him off their racecourses
S. Australia and M.L. are out to destroy
him in his nefarious shop and back lari’,
and the other parts of Australia shouldn’t
be above following their example. There is
no place for the bookmaker in the new age.
NEW LAMPS FOR OLD.
“In good King George’s glorious days’’
(which were, incidentally, George Wash-
ington’s days also), “when Britons set the
world ablaze,” the term “Freetrader” came
into common use. The Freetrader then
wanted Customs duties preserved, he wanted
more duties and increased duties, for he lived
by evading them, and if there were few or
none to evade he would have had tQ turn
honest. He was an open-air man, a man of
the midnight sea, stalwart, tarry, wet, dirty,
armed, profane, and probably with murder on
his soul. The name remains, but it applies
now to a pallid, neat, prim, bell-toppered.
indoor party of office habits who hates Cus-


toms duties much more than the De\il e\ei
hated holy water. # ,
Similar reversals of form are common
enough. The present Labor party, especially
in Queensland and N. S. W ales, isn t a whit
more like the original one than \> illiam
McMillan, who doubtless loathes violence,
is like any bloodstained person of the same
description who died in his boots at Tyburn
on a matter of illicit spirits. The trouble
began in the wartime. In 1914-15-16 Aus-
tralia sent so many soldiers to the war that
male departures, largely Laborites, were
280,000 above the average. These were
voluntary men who believed in the cause of
Australia. The aliens, anarchists, Bolsheviks
and I.W.W.’s remained behind, to capture the
party and its machine. When the first refer-
endum on compulsory service came, towards
the end of 1916, and the second a year later,
the people who didn’t go were able to defeat
the proposal by a small majority because
in the absence of the patriots the others had
captured the machine and had made it the
test and brand of a good Laborite that he
should insist on Australia being the one
pariah among the fighting Allies —the only
one which let men of shame stay at home in
luxury and power while men of honor died in
the trenches to preserve our civilisation. The
fact that Australia, after exempting the un-
desirable class, |£ill sent out as large a pro?
portion of soldiers as some countries which
exempted no class, shows the amazing extent
to which ablebodied treachery was left in
possession. And it proceeded to make its
possession permanent by ejecting the sur-
viving founders of Labor-in-Politics and
nearly every man of ability and character
in the movement. Those who remained of
the first N. S. Wales Labor Ministry were
emptied out, barring one old man of failing
powers and no importance. Holman,
Hughes and McGowen were among the
first to go. Higgs, expelled the other
day for mild criticism of the methods
by which the ruling camarilla made
such an awful failure of the Federal elec-
tion in Queensland, was the last. Every-
thing was done to prepare a hostile recep-
tion for the returning army which had made
the name of Australia honored throughout
the world—to receive its members with vio-
lence, as happened at Queensland, and to
keep them out of Parliament, out of the
unions and out of work. This was New
Labor, as distinguished from the Old Labor
which had fathered the compulsory military
training system.
With the new control a new sort arrived,
naturally, to fill up the Labor ranks. All
manner of wild-eyed, wild-haired revolu-
tionaries came in. The useless, unproduc-
tive, non-laboring pony element arrived. So
did the baser sort of drink-selling
interest. So did a new sectarian force.
And with that force a surprising number of
men who have become rich without doing
anything hard or useful—men who no doubt
argue that it is safer for a rich man to be
inside than out, for then he can help to so
arrange matters that laws for the destruction
of capital shall pass fry his kind of capital.
Having money to burn and words to waste,
such men have pushed into places of com-
mand. It is the same in Russia, where out
of the 12 commissaries who run the show only
one has any connection with hard work.
Naturally, too, these men have low ethical
standards; so that whenever any dubious
job is suggested it is almost taken for
granted that a New Laborite invented it:
and that is about the last thing that would
have been suspected of Old Labor, which
was the most transparently honest and sin-
cere body that the world has seen since the
days of the other Apostles.
Wherefore, as this paper said earlier in
the course of these sorrowful remarks, New
Labor resembles Old Labor no more than
William McMillan resembles his political
ancestor, the law-breaking Freetrade im-
porter who swore horribly at midnight on
the deck of a lugger. And this is a matter
for the greater regret because there never
was a time when Australia so badly needed
sincere and honest politicians. Of personal
corruption there is very little in Australian
Parliaments; but corruption of the general
sort has become so common that the whole
electorate is to a very large extent demoral-
ised. The struggle between parties is mostly
a struggle to offer the biggest baits, and
the plain word for baits is bribes. Per-
fectly honest talk to the electors is thus
almost unknown. Each side says only what
it believes the crowd wants to hear. Truth
is at a discount. Instead of the constituency
being the better informed after listening to
its political “leader,” it is, as a rule, only
the more confirmed in its errors. Of course,
this sort of thing cannot go on for ever.
Sooner or later we shall have to face the
facts. Meantime, those who put their coun-
try before party can do one small thing to
free the land from its slavery: they can
encourage independent speech and action in
their politicians and political candidates. In
Victoria and Queensland they have an imme-
diate opportunity of doing, their country
this service.
ETCHINGS OF ITALY.
My room in Florence overlooks the Ponte
Vecchio and the grey-green Arno, and all
around it are the narrow, stony streets where
Guelph and Ghibelline, Amidei and Buon-
delmonte, Visdomini and Überti fought
out their ephemeral and bitter quar-
rels. The high, green-shuttered houses look
furtively across at each other from under
scowling eaves, the decaying palaces stand
at street corners four-square like .fortresses,
and the church bells still clash with belli-
gerent voices as they did when summoning
Black and White to battle for the party-
cause.
This morning there is a curious hush over
the city. The screaming of the electric
cars, the crashing uproar of the iron-tyred
market carts, the pealing of bells on' the
necks of the mules, and the deep-chested
calling of the hawkers are all stilled. In
the piazzas are silent people standing in
little groups—groups which for a very good
reason do not allow themselves to become
too large. The only movement in the streets
comes from the military. Over the low hum
of voices you can hear the clatter of the
patrols in every part of the city. They ride
m compact bodies over the bridges, circle
discreetly through the winding lanes, always
keeping just out of contact with the mob.
There is a machine-gun mounted on the roof
of our pension, and through the gates of old
palaces you get glimpses of stacks of rifles
and equipment, of groups of gambling sol-
diers squatting in the courtyards.
There has been more shooting, this time in
Bologna. A Government official passing a
crowd of strikers has had a bottle thrown
at him. The carabineers, always near at
hand, have opened fire upon the crowd, and
five strikers have been killed. So all the
cities of Tuscany, and several towns in other
parts, have proclaimed a one-day general
strike. This one-day strike is a method of
drilling the proletariat. It becomes daily
better disciplined and more complete. It
kills with one stroke the whole industrial
and commercial life of the country, and it
turns the bones of the middle class to water,
for one never knows when its mysterious
efficiency will be used for the purposes of
revolution.
Train travelling, which in other countries
is a commonplace method of progression, is
in Italy an epic. The road takes you through
a book of old ballads, the train turns in
swift succession the pages of a universal
history. It lifts you from under the shadow
of Vesuvius, where the villages, emptied by
emigration, look more pathetic than Pom-
peii ; out of picturesque Naples, which clings
aifectionately to its absentee landlords,
piously tills their ground and piously starves
on it, milks goats at the house door, has frank
and unusual notions of public decency,
trembles at the Camorra, dreads the evil
eye, keeps the lamps of its street shrines
always lighted, has a church for every day
in the year, and always votes Tory at the
elections —the train lifts you out of this,
and, without any appreciable break in the
narrative, lands you in Itome, where milk
is delivered in more or less sanitary milk-
carts, street shrines are lighted with elec-
tric light, modern villas are built on the
ruins of Roman arches, and where the party
politician takes the place of the Camorra.
From Rome It lifts you into Florence, where
the wars of Black and White have been
changed for the no less destructive ones of
Capital and Labor. From Florence it will
take you to Venice, which is no longer a
glittering bauble but a great commercial
port; or to Genoa, which has no absentee
landlords or Camorras, which votes solidly
socialistic, whose, street shrines are empty
but whose docks and factories are full. And
between these grand halts in the epic’s pro-
gress the train sweeps vou through the haunt-
ing loveliness of Southern Italy, where the
farms are like fortresses, through the Cam-
pagna, where the reign of the malarial mos-
quito lasted longer than the rule of Rome ;
through the tragic landscape of Tuscany,
where every walled and pinnacled city
mouldering on the stony hills tells of the
past anguish of bloody sieges and the pre-
sent agony of growing poverty.
Every city you pass through is a camp,
and the military arm is everywhere. Its
symbol is the great golden Umberto effigy
in Rome, the somewhat foppish-looking
monarch mounted on a huge ramping
charger, in whose belly the architect enter-
tained 21 notabilities to dinner. The effigy
silhouetted against the white enormity of
marble behind it dominates the city. It can
be seen from all the seven hills, a vulgar,
glittering upstart at the architectural feast
of ancient Rome. The strenuous traffic of
the Corso on which it glares sinks to the
nervous activity of ants before it. It is the
emblem of Italy’s material progress, which
has been impressive enough to demand a
monument ten times as high and twice as
blatant. The figures of that progress are
stupendous. To add in 30 years ten mil-
lions to the population, a thousand millions
to the private wealth and untold millions
to the public debt are no mean achieve-
ments. To reduce a death-rate in some dis-
tricts by nine-tenths; to teach, one-half of
an entirely illiterate popplation to read and
write; to convert the cesspool that was
Naples into one of the busiest ports of
Europe; Venice, sacred to tourists, into a
great naval base; and Florence, beloved of
the dilettante, into a centre of industrial
unrest, are exploits deserving of commemo-
ration in brass and marble. From a condi-
tion of pre-scientific simplicity to rise to the
first place in Europe in electrical develop-
ment and become second only to U.S.A. in
utilisation of water-power, from a conglom-
eration of warring States ruled by priests
and foreign princes to become a unified
nation with sacred egoism apd imperial
destiny all complete, are things to boast of.
The Italians boast of them. Via Gari-
baldis. Via Cavours and Via Mazzinis
abound. Every date in the calendar is com-
memorated in the names of streets and
squares, marking the political revolutions of
only 50 years. There are as many memorial
brasses as Renaissance canvases, and there
are enough busts of the heroes of the Risor-
gimento stretching along the Gianicolo to
supply a cycle of Imperial Rome. In the
10 years previous to the war the pace had
quickened. Milan became the silk-manufac-
turing centre of the world. The railways
were changed from private to public owner-
ship and were being, electrified. The popu-
lation began to exceed that of France, im-
ports and exports had nearly doubled, ship-
ping trebled and emigration quadrupled. The
conversion of the peasant from an agricul-
tural to an industrial basis was in full blast.
The war accelerated the process. Foreign
debt, sacred egoism, imperial destiny, indus-
trial revolution and need for emigration
chased each other down the straight. The
peace brought no cessation, and the tremend-
ous forces let loose by the Risorgimento face
one another to-day under conditions which
make constructive solutions hard of applica-
tion. The military method settles nothing,
while the army is said to be becoming
steadily more reluctant to join in the game
of strike-breaking. *Even the picked corps
of bersaglieri which is kept ready for ser-
vice in disaffected areas is becoming suspect,
and in any case military movements for poli-
tical purposes only take place by sufferance
of the trades unions, which control the rail-
ways and in some provinces control every-
thing else as well. The Umberto monument
as a symbol of Italian democracy looks a
little premature.
FLORENCE, xlugust. M. G. SKIPPER.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Digger in the Dock.
In sentencing an ex-soldier to five months’
gaol, S. Australia’s Chief Justice Murray
lately said: “It would be most unfortunate
if it were thought that offences could be
committed by ex-soldiers and would receive
no punishment.” The sentiment will be
chem-ed loudest by former members of the
A.I.F. In the grand total of those who
went overseas there was the inevitable pro-
portion of criminals—though probably it was
the smallest that ever accompanied an
expeditionary force. These men didn’t go
abroad to fight, as a rule, but to practise
their profession under the most favorable
conditions possible. Assisted by the uni-
form which had been consecrated in the
hearts of the British on Gallipoli they pro-
ceeded to “put it across” misguided admirers
in the United Kingdom. Some infamous
things were done. One man —a 1916 rein-
forcement who had seen no active service—
imposed himself on an Edinburgh family on
his first leave, and, after being entertained
by them for 10 days, stole some hundreds
of pounds’ worth of jewellery and deserted
to Ireland. Another committed a series of
offences in London, chiefly burglaries; was
caught and handed over to the A.I.F.
authorities; escaped from the ineffective
Salisbury Plain “clink” three times; and,
like his friend, ended in Ireland. Peter
Barrie, who has just been sentenced in
London for conspiracy, seems to have
been a typical member of a class which
worked hard to heap mud upon the name of
Digger. Joining the A.I.F. in 1915 he was
discharged in 1916 as medically unfit, and
was sentenced in 1917 for pocket-picking.
Wherever a Judge piles up the sentence in
respect of an ex-soldier of this class, there
is not the slightest need for him to offer a
quasi-apology. At any rate, not so far as
ex-A.LF. members are concerned. But
there is another class —a class composed of
men who had no criminal record before they
joined up, who saw service in the firing-line,
and who, as an outcome of injuries sus-
tained there, were mentally and morally
affected. It would be wickedly unjust to
put them in the same category as the others.
Every ex-soldier who appears in a criminal
court has this claim on. the public, that his
case should be considered with a view to
ascertaining how much, if any, of his crim-
inality is the outcome of his work in the
line. Where deterioration as a result of
war service is established, an accused has,
in principle, at least the same right to con-
sideration as an injured employee possesses
under the Workmen’s Compensation Act.
Thus a period of probation might meet the
case of one prisoner, while a similar offence
committed by another would call for a
swingeing term in gaol.
The Treasurer and the Note Issue.
Treasurer Cook made some unconvincing
statements in defence of the proposal to
further inflate the note issue by making the
joint-stock banks hold idle, in paper, an aver-
age of 15 per cent, of their deposits—this in
addition • to such surplus paper as may be
required to meet demands and the necessary
reserves of gold, silver and bronze. He said
that if all the gold in the country—gold in
banks, in the Treasury, and in the Federal
note reserve —was counted up, and it was all
reckoned as a reserve against notes and none
left as a reserve against foreign gold liabili-
ties, then Australia shows up better than any
other country when similarly weighed and
measured. It has 77 per cent, reserve, while
Spain, the next best, shows 63; the Nether-
lands shows 61, the United States 58 and
Switzerland 55 per cent. In other words,
Australia keeps more notes lying idle and*
earning nothing, and more gold lying idle
and doing nothing, than any other country
thinks necessary, and it is in the position of a
man who puts a superfluous mortgage on his
house at interest and keeps a superfluous
sum buried in the ground as a guarantee
against .it. The following is the position as
Cook puts it and as it might be put:—
Australia as It Is.
Total Proportion
Gold Held. Total Notes. of Reserve.
£44,000,000 £57,000,000 77 per cent.
And as It Might Be.
£34,000,000 £47,000,000 72 per cent.
or
24,000,000 37,000,000 65 „ „
Other Countries as They Are.
Spain .. £98,000,000 £156,000,000 63 per cent.
Netherlands.. 53,000,000 87,000,000 61
U.S.A. .. 547,000,000 941.000,000 58 ’’ ,”
Switzerland.. 21,000,000 38,000,000 55 „ ,’
All the rest on Cook’s list are lower, down
to Italy with a gold reserve of 9 per cent.
(The list takes no account of Russia, Ger-
many, Austria, Serbia, Hungary and other
dubious bankrupts, but deals with solvent
States only.) Britain’s gold reserve is 30 per
cent. So the position is about as follows if
Cook is right in regarding all the gold in a
country as available security for its notes,
even when the country has such stupendous
foreign liabilities payable in gold as Australia
has (and he would probably be as mad as
all the Cooks that spoiled all the broth in
creation if contradicted) :—
Austn-alia manages to keep about £11 per inhabi-
tant of notes in existence, while Spain, reckoned
a highly solvent country these days, is content with
about £7 10s. To achieve this dubious distinction
Australia forces its banks to keep idle unprofitable
and useless great wads of £1000 notes. Australia
keeps about £3 15s. per inhabitant more gold lying
idle than Spain does to protect the extra £3 10s.
worth of paper lying idle. There seems a lot of
idleness about the business.
If this country withdrew and paid off £10,000,000
worth of the worst form of notes, it would still, as
Cook puts things, have 72 per cent, gold reserve,
and if it withdrew £20;000,000 worth it would have
65 per cent, reserve against Spain’s 63 per cent.
In the latter case there would be £20,000;000
more money going round earning interest instead
of lying comatose like a mummy.
The Government’s idea seems to be to increase
the compulsory note-issue, and, if the reserve is kept'
up, to increase the idleness and comatoseness.
A possible theory is that the passion for big
figures has got the Government down and
bitten it.
Jonathan and the Jap.
The United States looks a more difficult
problem than Australia for any colored race
which wants to argue immigration questions,
partly because it isn’t, like the British
Empire, 75 or SO per cent, colored itself,
and partly because California, where the
trouble lies, is three times as thickly peopled
as N. S. Wales, and can’t be claimed as
waste and unused land like most of our
North. Yet the demand for the admission
of Japanese to California, where there are
said to be 150,000 or 200,000 of them already,
is making the sky look very thundery. The
Japanese also claim the right of their people
to own land in California, where they own
a great deal already, though the habit of
prohibiting the ownership of freehold by
aliens is fairly common all over the world.
The Japanese themselves allow no foreigner
to own land in their country, unless he is
naturalised, which he can only become by
assuming a“ Japanese name and marrying
into a Japanese family, so that his wife’s rela-
tions may police him all the rest of his life.
Still our brown brother sees no discrepancy
or absurdity in his attitude; and other
brothers of all hues are much the same.
Britain, when it was a brother to the Boer
republics, saw nothing humorous in demand-
ing concessions for its people in Boerland
that it wouldn’t grant to them in England
itself. Pacifists and internationalists, of
whom Australia has too many, say that
differences like these need never lead to war,
and that there is no call for armed forces of
any sort as a security against them—that
the right thing is to depend on reason and
appeal to the other fellow’s sense of justice,
which is never really absent. And it never
is absent. Also it is mighty and will pre-
vail. But, unfortunately, the best army
and navy decide which is justice, and then
it prevails, but not till then. Japan has
served the world with a comprehensive notice
that its definition of justice is the admission
of its people everywhere qn the same terms
as Europeans, including Englishmen, Scotch-
men, Irishmen, etc. No argument will
change that view, and if it isn’t accepted
Nippon will, on present appearances, go out
of the League of Nations; and the U.S. never
came in. If the debate comes in this direc-
tion and we are involved —well, Australia
will at least be able to say that it did its
best in the matter of running away. The
North is the nearest point for attack by the
only races that have a grievance against
us on which there can be no compromise. So
the capital, Parliament, Government, mili-
tary and naval headquarters and as much
of the population as possible, also the watch-
ful eye of the sentinel at the gate, are
located as far south as possible to be out
of the fighting line and out of the road. They
couldn’t bolt much further from where they
are wanted without being drowned.
The Evanescent Bluejacket.
Once more a civilian Naval Minister has
solemnly assured the taxpayer that it is the
ambition of his Department to man the Aus-
tralian Fleet with Australians. Having
“this object in view,” the gentleman “hopes”
to reduce the personnel of the Fleet,
by June 30, 1921, from 6628 to 4651,
and the better to realise his object the battle-
cruiser Australia and six of the River-class
destroyers—the boats that Joseph Cook
visioned as steaming up the Brisbane and
the Torrens —are to be retired from busi-
ness, 119 officers and 1858 men thus re-
leased being sent back to the Royal Navy
which lent them to Australia in the first
place. But when the whole 1977 have gone
home the R.A.N. will still be British to a
large extent. Most of its officers, petty
officers and artisan ratings are British. So
are many of the gunners, signallers, stokers,
wireless men and engine-room ratings. W.
H. Laibd Smith admits that “the petty
officers have had to be obtained mainly from
the Rpyal Navy.” He explains that “under
the system of a seven-years’ engagement
very few Australian ratings have offered;
themselves for petty officers”; and “with the.,
object of inducing them” to qualify for these
and higher positions “the period of engage-
ment has been increased from seven to 12
years.” But he tells only half the lamentable
story. The fact is that the Australian
bluejacket doesn’t find the Navy as attrac-
tive as the Briton does. He can do better
for himself ashore. He signs on for seven
years partly because he is young and adven-
turous, and partly because he is young and
broke. There is no pension hanging to the
job, but there is a system of deferred pay.
When his seven years are up he collects his
deferred pay, and unless Delilah and
Isaac No«es get the money, or unless he
happens to be ambitious and likes the life,
that is the last the Navy sees of him. It has
cost something considerable to make him
efficient, and all the labor and the expense
have gone for nothing. Extending the term
of his engagement for five years won’t cure
him of his propensity for quitting when
he has become most valuable to the nation;
neither will it swell the poor trickle of
enlistments that necessitates our borrowing
petty officers and men from England. Con-
sidered from all points of the compass it
is a singularly futile proceeding. Nothing
will answer but increased pay and a pen-
sion system. The naval rating is a skilled
worker, but his pay is not to be compared
with that of the unskilled worker who lumps
wheat or coal. He gives the best years of
his life to his country’s service, but his •
country does not guarantee to look after him
(or his widow) when he is past work. It
persists in regarding him as a temporary
hand, who is not entitled to receive the wage
of a corporation scavenger. The Australian
Government will have to struggle out of
this attitude of mind. If it wants young
Australians to devote their lives to the
Army and Navy it will have to make it
worth their while. When a young fellow goes.'
into the Navy he has a right to expect (1)
that the job will be permanent, (2) that the-
pay will be equivalent to that of an artisan,
and (3) that there will be a pension for
him when he is past work. Until these
three essentials are provided the R.A.N. will
be regarded as a good service to get out of
—or to keep away from.

The Human Female.
\Y riEN the British miners' and other unions
were in conference debating for and against
the greatest strike that the Empire has ever
seen, a deputation of women asked for a
hearing. They were some of the disfran-
chised adult half of the people concerned —
the wives or domestic rouseabouts or house-
. laborers of the men. They were people
whose wages and food and clothing and
housing were just as much at stake as the
men’s, with this difference, that, in case of
strike, they would have to go on working
without wages and work twice as hard with-
out wages, because they would have to keep
the children alive somehow with nothing to
give them, while the men made holiday and
had at least some compensation. The appli-
cants didn’t get a hearing. They didn’t
even get inside. The free and chivalrous
male creature simply told his ill-paid chattel
to go away. Even in England woman has
the vote now with some limitations, and she
can sit in the Commons (two of her have
already been elected). She is represented
both in person and by proxy in the House
which decides for or against the Kilhaddock
drainage scheme or the Ballymuddy fishery
idea. But the unionist’s wife, ill-paid
laborer and domestic rouseabout isn’t an
ex officio member of her husband’s union, so
she is neither a member nor an elector of
the almighty House which decides for or
against her and her children’s pay, food,
clothes, fuel and housing. The male union-
ist who talks so much about Liberty and
the Rights of Labor (except long-hour house
labor without fixed pay) is the person who
keeps her in this helpless and disfranchised
condition. Even before woman got the fran-
chise it began to slip away, for the Legisla-
ture to which she wa.s reluctantly admitted
began to be superseded in the food-and-
clothes affairs of life by one from which she
was as rigorously shut out as ever. So
the human female is sliding back, for prac-
tical purposes, towards the place she held
300 years ago.

Prices and Publicity.
N. S. Wales Attorney-General McTier-
NAN’s legal advisers must have put in quite
half an hour among the libraries before they
produced for him his bill on profiteering.
They dug out some picturesque phrases re-
lating to ancient market-regulations, and
garnished the bill with them, quite as if the
Government was contemplating a 14th-cen-
tury barbecue instead of a very modern entrde.
It is a pity that they did not persuade Mc-
Tiernan to go the whole hog and hire a
doublet and hose before introducing the bill.
It would have enhanced its mediaeval flavor
besides relieving the tedium of Parliament.
Nevertheless it isn’t perhaps too late to ask
John Storey to get the Attorney-General to
send his merry men back to their books for an
extra half-hour. If they licked their fingers
wet enough to turn over a few more pages
of Economic History they might find out
that “forestalling” and “regrating” were
much more recognisable offences in the
Middle Ages than they are to-day. A “fore-
staller” was one who bought up goods and
food on their way to market in order to get
them more cheaply. It was comparatively
easy to recognise that this had been done
in a 14th-century town-market, where each
producer sold his own goods, and where the
local authorities knew the productive pos-
sibilities of each vendor. For the volume of
production was not large in each area, and
the amount of effective toil put in by each
individual was patent even to the mob.
The same remarks apply to “regrating,” a
pleasant practice which is defined as the pur-
chase of commodities in the market in order
to sell them again in the same market at
a higher price. And they also apply to
“engrossing”—another habit anathema to the
medimval McTiernans —which consisted of
purchasing growing corn or corn which had
not yet been winnowed and brought to the
market in order to keep it back till its value
had risen. But somehow McTiernan’s
legal advisers forgot to put in an excom-
munication against engrossing. Fortunately
or unfortunately, our markets —even for
foodstuffs—are not so local as the mediaeval
ones were. Even the dealers in Sussex-
street can hardly tell nowadays whether
Bill Smith, of Nambucca, is consigning all
his butter and eggs to their tender mercies.
And if they do know this, certainly no one
else does—at least, not in the metropolis.
And w'hen we come to manufactured pro-
ducts. the jig-saw is even harder to put
together, for the market ceases to be a
metropolitan one and becomes Australian or
even world-wide. The mediaeval price-fixers
had this advantage. The local market-town
exhausted the possibilities of sale for Nick'
Bottom, of the Weavers’ Guild, or Hodge,
the tenant of the manor. Each area of pro-
duction was small enough to allow effective
supervision by the local authorities by whom
these regulations were administered. But
how is even Beeby going to supervise pro-
duction in such a way that he can determine
whether products are being held back from
the market or not? In the case of agricul-
tural and dairy produce, he can’t do it from
the fourth floor of a building in Elizabeth-
street. His only hope would be to persuade
the Government to equip him with a whole
series of local agents or local courts. Legis-
lation of this kind presupposes a much more
adequate administrative equipment than has
hitherto been imagined. The English his-
torian Stubbs used a striking phrase to
describe the failure of the Lancastrian
dynasty, during which the English Parlia-
ment touched its height of power in the
Middle Ages. “Constitutional progress,” he
wrote, “had outrun administrative power.”
The Labor party might well paint that sen-
tence up over the door of the Trades Hall
or use it for a frieze round Macdonell
House. The salvation of the bonehead in
this country at present doesn’t depend upon
the passing of Acts of Parliament so much
as upon effective action to secure the ad-
equate administration of what we’ve got.
Meanwhile, McTiernan’s bill, to be quite
fair, when it cuts the mediaeval cackle to
come to the profiteering horses, does sug-
gest securing access to company balance-
sheets, which is something; though here
again to do this satisfactorily will tax the
abilities of the proposed central tribunal. If,
however, this can be secured, light may be
found to be, after all, the best policeman.
Meantime there ought to be a drastic over-
haul of the bill, before it gets any further,
by a small committee, including, say, R. F.
Irvine, who teaches economics at the Uni-
THE NEW CURRENCY.
LADY: “I can give you something to eat, hut I cannot give you cash."
HUNGRY HENRY: “I could take it in bonds, mum."
versity; G. W. Waddell, who drafts bills
to order for any Government; and the afore-
said Beeby, who, for all his reputed political
crimes, has given a great deal of time and
thought to these ticklish questions.

A Cry for Archbishops Named
McDougall.
“Solomon Malaprop” wants a change:—
An urgent need in Australia is for a consignment,
or several consignments, of pious, capable, strenu-
ous Scotch Roman Catholic priests—men with names
like McDougall and McTaqgart, Mclntosh and
McLeod, even McParritch. There is absolutely no
reason why they shouldn’t be procured in abund-
ance. The North of Scotland, where the Clan
McParritch dwells, has always been largely Catholic.
The members of the Old Faith in England and Scot-
land number about 2,500,000, which isn’t so much
less than the 3,200,000 of Erin. When we count in the
3,315,000 Catholics in Canada and other British pos-
sessions in North America (people chiefly of
French descent), and a few sundries in Mauri-
tius and elsewhere, Irish Catholicism is only
an item in the Catholicism of the Empire.
The fact that the pushing Hibernian race figures so
enormously in the Australian priesthood was an
accident which didn’t matter in days when the
Irish priest or bishop or archbishop was only a
cleric, and didn’t bring Irish politics along with
him. In fact, until Parnell’s time there were few
Irish politics of the importable variety to bring.
Now the position is changed and Ireland has heaps
of exportable politics. Political priests of the
Mannix variety have set up a tacit understanding
that to be a good, honest Catholic —a devout mem-
ber of the old Italian Church—it is necessary to
seethe with the politics of a small country which
never did anything very remarkable for the said
Church. (Even St. Coi-umba didn’t belong to it, but to
a separate Irish Church which argued with the Latin
communion for supremacy in England, and St. Pat-
rick's membership has been questioned.) Mannix even
laid it down in an address to his co-religionists that it
was a duty to make all possible trouble here until
Ireland got either autonomy or independence. No
one can imagine that a Roman Catholic priesthood of
Scottish, English or French-Canadian origin would
use the Church for such political ends; and that
fact, combined with the mixing of Australian and
Irish concerns and the employment of a world-wide
Faith to boost other people’s mundane affairs over
which we have no control, and especially the vag-
aries of the crowd of nonentities who climb into
office by these means, make people wish that Arch-
bishop McDougall was more plentiful here and
Archbishop O’Flynn less so.
Well-earned Disaster.
If everybody in the Ma State who has any-
thing much to lose .should lose it in a
national bankruptcy—the present Govern-
ment is now busy with its third big loan
inside six months—most of them should
have the satisfaction of knowing that they
deserved it. Twenty-five or 30 years ago,
when taxation of all sorts was about £1 395.
per head per annum, it was pointed out
that if the exaction was raised to, say,
£4 195., there would be £3.500.000 clear
(say £3,000,000 for works, which was a great
sum then, and the rest to reduce the old
debt), and borrowing could thus be abso-
lutely prohibited and done away with. The
effort would only have been required for a
short time, for the interest bill would steadily
diminish, and when the earnings of new
works were not eaten up by interest bills the
revenue from them would help. The effort,
m fact, would have been over by now and
the debt paid off. Fools said the people
couldn t pay more than they were doing, but
the tact that they pay £9 per head per
annum now, though they get neither public
works nor debt-reduction out of it, but
merely keep the dead horse afloat, so to
speak, shows what fools they were. Cowards
said it wasn’t worth while. So the Storey
Government became inevitable, with, per-
haps, worse ones to follow. For the Storey
Government was the natural result of the
Holman Government, and that grew natu-
ral y out of Wade, who as naturally
evolved from Carruthers, who was out of
Parkes (imp.) Each said indefinitely
that moderate loan-drinking was good, and
each moved the line that divided moderation
from excess a pint or a gallon further on,
tiH at last it advanced by kegs and bounds,
If the plug had been put m permanently,
and as suggested in the early nineties of last
century, tiiere would be no such people as
the present Cabinet, and the State debt
would .be non-existent, and the works would
exist just the same, and the taxation would
be about half what it is, and the community
v}- w holly different. The atmosphere
in which the Storey and Holman Cabinets
grew the only one in which they could grow
-—would not have been. There were 125
tools or cowards in N. S. Wales Assembly—
it used to have as many fools and cowards
as that—-who couldn’t see what was plain
and inevitable, and there are 90 there now
who apparently don’t even see the event
when it has happened, and are as blind to the
need of drastic though belated reform as
the fools who went before them. The
present Cabinet, which is the previous one
only an inevitable stage further advanced in
mental atrophy, was the natural outcome of
corruption, just as court buffoons and
eunuchs were the natural outcome of another
form of corruption. It got into office by
promising to be more financially diseased than
its predecessor, the community having been
taught that disease is the one supreme
virtue. In other words, it promised more
circus and less. work. It found so many
blank cheques in the shape of unused loan
authorisations lying about that it didn’t even
require to go through the form of asking the
S re P resen Natives befo# dashing huge
lOU’s on the market and putting more huge
burdens on posterity. The Storey Cabinet
was made in the warehouses of York-street,
Sydney; in the daily newspaper offices; in
the Union Club; in the Upper House and
other haunts of old orthodoxy. Now that
it is made and in full work, The Bulletin
says confidently that it doesn’t know one
political or mercantile or financial potentate
who doesn’t deserve the worst the Storey
Cabinet may do to him. No Russian grand
duke who lately lost his property and his
head represented a class which prepared its
own fate more carefully.
When it comes to putting up the cash for
their allegedly starving Alma Mater most of
the wealthy graduates of Melbourne Uni. are
2i°L°“ * he spot. The Uni. is trying to raise
±lOO.OOO, and up to September 20 it had
managed to rake in £15,256. Amongst the
givers of £lOO or more there were remark-
ably few of the successful doctors and law-
yers who owe to the embarrassed institution
the education that put them where they are.
Purely if people who benefit only indirectly,
it at all, by the work of the University are
expected to contribute, it is up to those who
are making fat incomes as the direct result
of the license to kill or wrangle conferred
on them by the Uni. to give a strong lead.
The new defence scheme contains this other
detect—there is still no power to send any
part of the military forces out of Australia,
and that must be done to really win a war.
Repulsing an invasion, however thoroughly!
is not in itself victory, for in the process
the invaded country suffers much more than
the invader, and can only obtain reparation
by invading, or threatening to invade, the
enemy’s territory in its turn. To raise volun-
tary forces after war has been declared
breaks up home organisations and involves .
the sending of raw formations abroad; it
wastes, half the results of a peace training,
and gives the enemy the initiative and a
long start. A striking force ready to move
immediately is needed in every war. Home-
defence forces, on the other hand, will only
be required if Australia is invaded; and
that means only if command of the sea is
lost.
*
A British officer escaped from Odessa re-
ports that in the early days of the Bol-
shevik upheaval young women were made
common property in many Russian districts
with most horrible results. That was when
the fresh young revolution ran loose, and
every petty Soviet was a law unto itself—
in the time before Lenin and Trotsky got
a conscript army together and made labor
compulsory and ruled with hard hearts and
iron. hands. After all, such things were
inevitable. There never yet was a great
disordered uprising of an ignorant people in
which there was not rape as well as blood-
shed and robbery. And’there never was a
serious attempt at a communistic State in
which the question didn’t arise whether girls
were common property as well as goods. The
status of woman as a human being—ns a
free, equal and self-owning animal —is a long
way from being settled yet even in advanced
Australia. The Labor leaders of the more
aggressive sort, for instance, never showed
any very strenuous enthusiasm for her en-
fi anchisement. Now that she is enfranchised
ma ki n £ the Legislature in which
she has an equal voice a practical nullity
and embodying all real power in assemblies
and strike committees and conferences and
unions of men, including alien men—Jacobin
Llubs which will run the show while the
National Assembly enjoys the form and cere-
mony. In fact, woman—a married creature
with indefinite hours and no fixed wage
hasn t arrived yet except on paper.


Empire Defence and the Safety of Australia.
Mr. Amery, XJnder-Secretary for the
Colonies, in giving an outline of the naval
defence proposals for the Empire, stated that
it had been decided to adopt “o new system,
consisting of a defensive chain, of which
each link will be primarily equipped to sus-
tain its own defence
Naval Defence is, to Australia, of grave importance, and calls
for preparedness with ships of war, guns and munitions.
Australia cannot risk her safety by dependence upon others
to supply her needs in these directions. The facilities for
their manufacture in case of necessity must be established
here. This makes essential the development, on a sound
basis, of the
Australian Iron
and Steel Industry
apart altogether from the economic aspect of the question.

POLITICAL POINTS
Cocky’s first Government will probably
arrive in Westralia. Lefroy, who led a
Nationalist Ministry for about 18 months,
has gone over to the Country party, and so
have .Angelo and Durack, two Nationalists
from 'the North. And a member of the
Mitchell Ministry, who considers that the
leadership of a Cocky Cabinet would suit
him down to the ground, is "believed to be
hovering on the brink.
From the Victorian State lobbies :
Lawson can’t hope for a big win on October 21,
and will probably get back with a reduced majority.
Heavy opposition is developing almost everywhere.
Even his biggest -supporters—Mackinnon, Baird, Hut-
chinson, Pennington and Barnes—are promised the fight
of their lives. Labor hopes to capture P’ran from
Mackinnon and knock out Ryan at Essendon, and
there is an even chance that Grenville will record
a vote of confidence in Scullin, who is tackling D.
H. Gibson, a brother of the man who now represents
Scullin’s old electorate of Corangamite in the Reps.
As Prendergast will probably lose his old friend
Tunnecliffe at Eaglehawk, Labor’s net gain will be
hardly worth noticing. The Hayseeds hope to grow
to a dozen at least, but even if their ambitions are
only partially realised Lawson won’t be feeling
happy. Barring four or five, the Nationalists are
keen to give Peacock a turn, and it is well known
that only Alexander’s modesty or loyalty prevented
him exploiting some delicate situations to his advan-
tage during the last 12 months. Lawson’s immediate
future is darkened by the possibility of drastic
reconstruction, but he is suspected of a desire to
dodge this and bolt, after a brief session, into a
long recess. The Premier, by the way, relies a lot
on the Public Service vote, and the coincidence that
the first increase under the new bill is expected
about a week before polling-day no doubt justifies
him indulging in the highest hopes.
There is a joyous prospect that the num-
ber of voters at the Queensland elections will
exceed the adult population of the State.
According to the Commonwealth Electoral
Department, which pursues the reluctant
elector with unrelenting ferocity, only
390,364 Queenslanders are entitled to vote,
but there are 455,728 names on the State
rolls, a difference of 65,364. And lots of
things are possible with an unexplained sur-
plus like that.
One of these days the S. M. Herald will
probably be hauled up before a perfectly new
Court (with a specially selected Judge on the
bench and no. jury provided for), and the
Court will -decide that 99J per cent, of its
receipts from advertisements since January 1,
1915, were extortionate (the Court will have
power to go back as far as that), the prices
being 200 times too high. Then after certain
simple formalities the paper will be fined
(without a jury) 97| per cent, of its last
six years’ revenue as a warning, and not
being able to pay the amount the whole affair
will be sold and the Worker people will buy
it cheap and make Mr. Boote editor, and the
womenfolk of the Fairfaxes will take to
doing laundry work for the wives of rich
Labor Ministers. All these things may be
if the Storey Government’s Profiteering Bill
is passed according to the original draft.
Meantime the question of N. S. Wales Parlia-
ment raising its own salary is to be referred
to a Judge sitting as a Royal Commission
(though what a judge knows in particular
about Parliamentary salaries is hard to say)
because the Government can’t make up its
mind whether the rise would be a case of
profiteering or not. It can’t recognise the
article in its own back yard.
“Kerango”: Money—at least public money
—is evidently no object to the Theodore
Government. To-day I received in Vic-
toria—so also did my wife —a copy of the
Queensland Government Gazette Extra-
ordinary dated 18/8/’2O. It was re-directed
from our old Queensland address, and our
names had evidently been obtained from the
electoral roll for which, by our departure,
we rendered ourselves ineligible 16 months
ago. The Gazette gives a detailed state-
ment of his Excellency Bill Lennon’s speech
at the opening of Parliament, and is a
verbose electioneering report with the usual
windy promises of future sound legislation,
and an apology for 24 non-submitted measures.
It is probably the first time in Australia
that the Government Gazette has been
converted into cheap party literature, but
the question that is intriguing the wife and
myself is—who’s going to be so obliging as
to cast our votes in Bananaland?
SITTING ON THE SAFETY-VALVE.
A new compulsory land-subdivision scheme
is foreshadowed in N. S. Wales, and the
really interesting part of the tale is the
reason given by the Lands Minister for the
move:—•
We have very little in the way of Crown lands, and
what there is is difficult of access.
When Knibbs made up his last volume of
Federal statistics there were in N. S. Wales
over 136,000,000 acres of land owned by the
State and only about 61,00c,000 acres owned
by private people, one-third of it cockies’
selections and the like held on time-payment.
So “Crown Lands” were by far the bigger
item. But it is painfully true that a lot of
these Crown lands are “difficult of access,”
for, to the sort of Government that N. S.
Wales is accustomed to, access means access
to or from Sydney and nowhere else. Be-
cause railways strike out west and in many
other directions from Sydney any place 200
miles west from that city is easy of access.
Because railways don’t strike out west from
Grafton, Port Stephens, Coff's Harbor, Jervis
Bay or Twofold Bay places 50 miles west
of "them are difficult of access. Small hold-
ings are being deserted close to the coast in
the northern part of the State, which is
also the most fertile part, because nobody
can afford to give them access to Sydney, and
no other access is reckoned as access. The
breaking up of big estates is a great idea,
and the big estate Wiucli most, requires
breaking up is the industrial, commercial,
financial and political monopoly of Sydney.
Simon Hickey, Labor member for Botany,
has introduced in the N. S. Wales Assembly
a bill having for its object the taxing of
doctor’s charges. According to Hickey even
some of the less prominent men of the pro-
fession have exacted from a patient a fee of
up to 100 guineas for a IP-minute operation,
while there are others who speedily reach
Easy-street by hitting up their patients who
have complaints not respectable enough to
be paraded before a judge and jury. It
looks likely. It also looks likely that a 10-
minute operation may be worth 100 guineas;
it just depends upon how many men could
do it as well and how long it takes to learn
how to do it. But there are rooks in even
the medical profession ; and it would do no
harm to the others if the Director of Public
Health, the Under Sec. and a nominee of the
8.M.A., as a taxing board, had a look at
disputed accounts in camera. The noble
work done by various doctors in hospitals
and elsewhere really has nothing to do with
the case.
Seeing that the N. S. Wales Government’s
third big loan in half a year is announced,
it would be fair that the party should
accompany it with an announcement that
repudiation isn’t, and never will be, on its
programme, and that, as the only possible
proof of its sincerity, it expels from the
party, and will continue to do so regularly,
those who advocate premeditated default in
any shape or form. It isn’t sufficient to
ride the high mule and say that the very
suggestion is an insult. It is time some-
body was insulted. Not nearly enough
people are insulted or insulted hard enough.
Repudiation was argued at the famous -Perth
Labor Conference, and the matter was re-
ferred to the Federal Labor members for a
yes or no. They didri’t say yes that the
public heard, possibly because it is foolish to
scare a lender till all the possible loans are
in. They didn’t say no that the public is
aware of, possibly because it is unwise to
quarrel with dishonest supporters. But
now that two State Labor Governments are
bidding with great energy for local money it
is a fair thing that the party became explicit.
An unusually stormy deputation of unem-
ployed waited on Queensland Premier Theo-
dore the other day to declare that whatever
merits there might be in his and Fihelly’s
policy, Brisbane is reeking with the workless
class, and it wanted something done. Theq-
ddre could find no bigger lion to throw at
his visitors than the suggestion that the
Tory press was sooling them on. Then the
deputation called Theodore a fool, and said
he had no policy, and Theodore implied that
the deputation was an ungrateful ass, and
they tore themselves apart.
Twitting a section of the civil servants
with ingratitude to his party, Mick Kirwan,
Labor member for Brisbane, declared that if
it hadn’t been for the party some of the mal-
contents would be “manuring the sile of
Flander-rs.” Abashed at his fatal fluency,
Mick has been trying to explain that he
didn’t mean it, and his record is better than
his luckless language. But it is precisely
this sort of imbecility that loses elections.
Westralian Treasurers have a short way
with deficits. When their annual tribula-
tion comes along they simply add it to the
public debt and thank God for Forrest’s
sinking fund. Premier Mitchell had a debit
balance of £668,000 the other day, but it
didn’t disturb him. He merely funded it
and returned to his slumbers. The proceed-
ing is agreeably suggestive of Micawber
discharging his obligation to Traddies by
handing him a p.n. But Cohen isn’t
Traddies.
As was expected, Premier Lawson has
announced his intention, if given a new lease
of power on October 21, to ask members of
the Vic. Assembly to increase their own
salaries from £BOO to £450 a year. The
proposal is described in the Government’s
manifesto as “bare justice.” In which case
this paper would prefer the lady with some
clothes on and a few more of the Electorates
off. In recasting the electorates the Cabinet;
proposes to prune off only live of the present
05 —and, of course, to leave the Weary
Chamber untouched.
The cable-man introduces the Gardens of
Trade: —-
The Rubber Growers’ Association has sent a cir-
cular to producers of plantation rubber urging them
to make a 25 per cent, reduction in their output in
order to check the accumulation of stocks and sta-
bilise the market.
Indian teagrowers are taking similar action
owing to the accumulation of stocks.
The go-slow worm wasn’t, after all, bred in
the Trades Hall apple, and there’s many
another fruit that is still rotten with it.
The Massey Government (M.L.) got the
wind up the other day. On the railway esti-
mates new Opposition-leader Wilford moved
a reduction of £5 “as an indication that the
time has arrived when the Government can
fairly grant full political and civil rights to
public servants.” Wilford did not speak to
the motion, and no other member rising, a
sudden-death division was taken. The result
was a tie (30 votes each) ; but chairman
Malcolm saved the situation with a casting
vote for the Government.
It is well to do things decently and in
order, unless one instinctively prefers to have
the pig sleep under the bed. N. S. Wales
Motherhood Minister McGirr stated in the
Assembly the other day that he is sending
out £5 baby-linen parcels with great vigor,
60 having gone, in a few weeks to Broken
Hill alone.. At that rate it promises to be
almost as big a thing as the baby bonus,
but with no Farliameutary sanction. It will
be interesting to find out, when the baby-
linen matter does come up, about vouchers,
medical certificates, proofs of poverty and
how much poverty is required to qualify,
whether the recommendation of a union offi-
cial is essential, whether all the recipients
are female, how often the alleged baby
doesn’t transpire, and some other things.
In his scheme for redistributing Assembly
seats Vic. Premier Lawson discards equal
electorates, and proposes to give 60 country
voters as much representation as 100 metro-
politan electors. The best that can be said
for this is that it will be an immense im-
provement on present conditions. Grenville
(4759 electors) and Warrenheip (9455) have
now a member each, just the same as Boroon-
dara (47,351) and St. Kilda (33,300). In
giving 40 per cent, preference to the country
Lawson has not only taken off his sombrero
to Henry Hayseed; he has swept the ground
with the rim of his headpiece.
DE TOUT MON CCEUR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I hate these half-bred milky rhymes
That ripple softly by,
That never dare to speak a truth
Or say “A lie’s a lie!”
I do detest the snarling mouth
That speaks the human cur;
I love the man whose life is whole,
Whose body sways beneath his soul;
I press, I hope, towards my goal—
De tout mon cceur!
Wouldst sing, my son, a heartsome song?
Come lend thy baritone
And troll a lay of someone’s wrong
Thou feelest as thine own;
And if thy voice in vibrant swell
Emotions deep should stir,
Then let me take thy hand ii> mine
And say: “Dear lad, that song' of thine
1 welcome it as foaming win*,
De tout mon cceur!”
If Heaven there be (as some would trust)
On Earth, in aether blue,
Then must this spark of vital dust
Aspire to find the True;
But if we play a laggard part
And need Compulsion’s spur, '
How poor a thing were this high game,
How lame a life, how trite and tame!
Let loose the reins (who dares to blame?) ;
I seek the goals of Joy, of Fame,
De tout mon cceur.

“Premier Storey is such a consistent patron of the
turf that he would sooner miss a political engage-
ment than abstain from attendance at a race
meeting.” —Daily paper.
Though Fullers chide and morning - papers bray
And Suns endeavor to obscure his glory,
Upon the even tenner of his way
Goes Storey.
Serene when drought or flood invades the West,
Untroubled by the gibes of saints or sinners,
Pursues he gaily the eternal quest
Of winners.
His fame is sure; for where the odds they scan
At Tattersall’s, in Market-street or Hunter,
They know him as that noblest work of man,
A punter.
And when, at length, the rod he shall have kissed.
(No statesman ever yet escaped a beating),
This be his epitaph: “He never missed
A meeting.”

This 38-year-old S. Alls. co. has expanded
remarkably during the period covered by the
table; but a comparison of the figures given
above is not of much value unless accom-
panied by a record of capital movements.
The next table, therefore, shows paid capital,
gross profits (after writing down premises
and securities and making allowances for
contingencies) and expenses :

♦lncludes £120,000 of reserves capitalised.
Since 1907 shareholders have put up £527,200
of new capital; but profits have been so
handsome that over the same period no less
than £584,467 of visible reserves have accu-
mulated after payment of regular 10 p.c. divs.,
besides occasional cash bonuses lately. And
the co. has done even better than that. For
many years the management has been mak-
ing substantial provision for contingencies,
and only two years ago the directors brought
to light £90,000 that had been stored out of
sight to protect accounts which had been
regarded as unsatisfactory but had proved
good. At the same time the directors
admitted that there still remained substantial
inner reserves to meet possible bad debts and
to fortify the co. against unforeseen trouble.
Since no inkling is given as to the amounts
which are withheld from view, the profits
presented for any year can be regarded as
only a general index to the company’s experi-
ence. It is a business of ups and downs;
but lately it has been nearly all ups. Despite
financing difficulties, which were mostly
relieved by Government-controlled pools,
agency cos. like Elder-Smith’s have had a
great time, abnormally high prices providing
much larger commissions than formerly.
A comparison of some of this co.’s figures
over two five-year periods shows extraor-
dinary expansion. Between 1910-15 £358,957
of profit was disclosed; during the five years
since, £568,096, not including the £90,000 of
internal accumulations revealed two years
ago. How much of this solid improvement
has been due to natural expansion of the old
business, and to what extent the abnormal
conditions have helped it, are known only to
those inside; but during recent years its
interests have been extended considerably.
Only 12 months ago the acquisition of the
Elder-Shenton Westralian business, in which
this co. had previously held an interest, added
about £58,060 to the book value of fixed
assets alone. Another view of how rapidly
the concern has moved is provided by this
comparison:—

During the past 10 years the book value of
all assets has expanded from £2.027,939 to
£3,814,279, an increase of £1,786,340, with
the assistance of £457,200 of new capital and
£768,135 of additional liabilities. That
means that, after paying handsome dividends
and protecting assets, the co. has visibly
improved its position in 10 years by an
amount equal to almost three-quarters of the
total money put up by shareholders. That
the past five abnormal years have been much
fatter than the previous quinquennium is
shown by this tabulation: —

Liabilities .. 193,997 574,138

During the earlier period £lOO.OOO of new
capital was got in; since then, £357,200, and
also £27,280 from share premiums. So
between 1910-15 the co.’s position was
visibly improved by £162,296, and during the
past five years by £371,429. The latter
figure, of course, included the £90,000 of
inner reserves revealed a couple of years
ago, most of which may more properly be
credited to the earlier period. On the other
hand, it is probable that during the recent
abnormal years in which the co. has been
prospering larger allowances than formerly
have been made for contingencies.
Twelve months ago the nominal capital
was increased to two millions by the creation
of 80,000 new £lO shares. So far 26,200
paid to £6 have been issued, 20,000 appa-
rently having gone to old holders at par, in
the proportion of one share for each half-
dozen previously held. A further 10,000
were made available for clients, and the
directors have placed 6200, paid to £6, on
which they have collected a premium of £4
Bs. per share. The inducement to the new-
comers was sweet; the latest 124 p.c. divi-
dend gives them a return on their money of
slightly over 74 p.c., while at the latest
balance there were visible assets of almost
£lO 12s. per share.

This business, established before Melbourne
was put on the map, handles practically
everything that the producer grows and
requires. Wool is its principal line, and last
year over one-third of the island State’s clip
of 35,000 bales passed through its hands.
For almost 80 years it had been a proprie-
tary, but in 1910 the business was passed
over to a public co., £15,000 being paid for
the goodwill of the old concern and £2703
for the goodwill of other businesses brought
into the fold. Capital during the. past 10
years has remained stationary at £90,000 —
20,000 £1 6 p.c. prefs. and 70,000 £1 ordi-
naries. But the £17,703 paid for goodwill
has proved a heavy load, for the balance of
profits after paying the prefs.’ 6 p.c. has
averaged under 10 p.c. p.a. on ordinary capi-
tal, notwithstanding that abnormal conditions
have lately hoisted earnings well above the
average. Of course, Webster and Sons, Ltd.,
has not had the same opportunities as the
big mainland concerns, and the Speck has
not been progressive in its primary indus-
tries. It has fewer cattle and sheep than
when the co. was formed 10 years ago, and a
smaller area under crop. That, of course,
has not only meant smaller commission
opportunities in handling produce, but has
also curtailed the demand for supplies,
machinery, etc. Last year was easily the
best the co. has had. Everything favored
earnings. Rising prices helped; the ship-
ping shortage was relieved and the export
of fruit facilitated; and improved conditions
generally resulted in a brisk market for
property. “Probably more farms have
changed hands during the past three years,”
says the co.’s chairman, “than in the pre-
vious 20.” If a period of stagnation is to
follow, this may lead to trouble. But
things have gone so well lately that the co.
has had very few bad accounts. For 1911,
the co.’s first year, gross profits amounted to
£19,180, and increased gradually until, owing
to the unfavorable 1914-15 season, they
slumped to £18,028. For 1919 they had
expanded to £24,882, and for the past year
to £30,865. But exes, have been mounting
rapidly, too: 1911, £11,928; 1915, £12,136;
1920, £19,868.
Besides its many and varied agencies, the
co. is interesting itself in land and forests.
Last year a pastoral property on the Der-
\Vent was acquired, the management hoping
to establish an irrigation settlement, utilising
electric power for pumping. But the State
has since decided .to acquire all water rights,
and the scheme has been dropped. The co.
will also have a timber mill at work shortly.
This table shows, among other things, the
effect of recent property purchases and the
outlay on equipping the timber area: —

The financing of the new enterprises and
the strain of more expensive stocks have
pushed liabilities up to £104,068, several
thousands more than the co.’s own funds,
not including capital represented by goodwill.
In view of the heavy debt incurred it is ques-
tionable whether the plunge into the irriga-
tion scheme was wise. As to assets, the
directors declare that everything has been
included in the balance-sheet at cost or
under, that plant has been ‘‘heavily written
down” and that “very full provision” has
been made for contingencies. In that case
profits may have been somewhat better than
shown in the first table; still, there is no
visible fatness about the old business. The
ordinaries have had an average of only 6}
p.c. p.a. But the management wisely
restricted the div. rate while reserves were
accumulated to replace the capital repre-
sented by goodwill.

This co. now balances only once each year,
so in the table above results for previous six-
monthly terms have been grouped to make
comparisons easier. Amalgamated Wireless
has so far not developed much of a punch,
and whether it eventually will depends on
the part the Commonwealth Government
decides to take in wireless. Twelve months
ago this co. placed proposals before the
Government for the establishment of a
direct, cheap service with Britain, and as
evidence of its ability to undertake the job
and relieve the badly-congested cable ser-
vices it has been able to instance its own
managing-director’s experimental plant at
Wahroonga (Sydney), where messages from
all corners of the world are flowing in daily.
Apparently, however, the co. is receiving
little encouragement from the Government,
which, w r hile proposing to do nothing itself,
still has the offer merely “under considera-
tion.” Meantime the co. is doing a fail-
amount of transmission work with coastal
vessels, though during the past year the two
shipping h'old-ups left gaps in that traffic.
Manufacturing interests have also been
steadily developed, and general electrical
trading is now a considerable item. During
the past year gross profit from trading and
revenue from wireless stations brought in
£47,033, compared with £42,476 during the
previous 12 months. Meantime expenses
have moved from £29,137 to £32,796.
But there is £19,900 more capital in the
business now.
A feature of the introductory table is the
large amount shown as written off each year.
For the past 12 months the directors show
a net profit of £8847 after appropriating no
less than £5389 for “depreciation.” Most
of these allowances each year are tacked to a
reserve for patents, depreciation and insur-
ance, which may include something that
could be regarded as a true reserve. But
in showing reserves in the table the £36,814
which has so far been accumulated in the
composite item has not been taken into
account. The reserves of £2064 are also
labelled as nominal, because a large portion
of the capital is not represented by tangible
assets, patent rights standing in the books
for £90,000. Paid capital is now £159,900,
and apart from patent rights there are these
assets: —
Plant, apparatus, stock, etc. .. £94,429
Book debts .. . . . . . . 30,567
Government securities .. .. 10,387
Cash 342
£135,725
Less liabilities ~ .. 23,450
Net tangible assets .. ..£112,275
That does not set out the position clearly,
for it is not possible to ascertain from the
accounts how much of the £36,314 of re-
serves for patents, depreciation, etc., should
be clipped from the figures. Undoubtedly
the co. is the possessor of valuable patent
rights, too ; but their precise worth from a
profit-earning point of view depends entirely
on the freedom with which the Government
permits the management to employ them.

It was a dull year for old Wallaroo
and Moonta. There were two non-pro-
ductive gaps during the term; owing
to the sick state of the copper mar-
ket and the seamen’s strike during
the first 24 months no ore was raised, then
after the Christmas spell-o the marine engi-
neers’ squabble kept the mines idle until
the middle of March —altogether five months
out of the twelve. So only 2302 tons
refined copper were produced—less than one-
fourth of the 1918 output. _ The- directors
give the year’s loss as £34,305, but that
was after crediting income with refunds of
£12,950 on 1915-16 war-profits tax previ-
ously paid and £5131 overcharged on ordi-
nary income-tax in 1917. * Actually, there-
fore, the year’s operations resulted in a loss
of £52,386, making the position worse than
appears at first glance. Until -two years
ago the directors regularly set. out the net
price realised per ton copper sold and costs
f.o.b. steamer. Nowadays they maintain
a silence on both subjects; but there is a
suspicion that any figures which they could
produce would not make cheerful reading.
In 1918 each ton copper shipped was cost-
ing almost £92 16s. Since then there have
been further increases, and to meet the
soaring cost of living during the past six
months the co. has voluntarily tacked two
increases, each of 6d. per day, to the award
rates. It is impossible to estimate actual
costs from the accounts, but if the year’s
working expenses be set against the year’s
production of 2302 tons refined copper, it
would appear that each ton has been cost-
ing in the vicinity of £l3O. But, of course,
owing to tlife stoppages, it was an abnormal
year. The copper market, too, had got
down as low as £7B, and though it did re-
cover to £122 that level was not maintained
for long, and prices have lately been around
£95. It is questionable whether this is
fiowadays any good to Wallaroo and Moonta
even if it had an unbroken run of produc-
tion. Certainly the co.’s position would be
hopeless at pre-war prices; though there is
little likelihood of that, for the conditions
which have lifted costs are also likely to
assure better prices for the product—at any
rate, when the world steadies down.
But Wallaroo and Moonta has other than
market troubles to face. The grade of ore
handled is not what it used to be, as is
shown by this comparison (the figures for
1919 are for six months only) : -

Owing to poorer grade, last year over 145,000
tons of Wallaroo ore would have been
required to give the same copper output as
114,438 tons in 1911. In the Moonta mines
the position is even worse; and in neither
mines has exploratory work unearthed any-
thing of much value. General-manager Han-
cock talks vaguely of having got on to “pay-
able” veinstuff here and there in the extended
Wallaroo workings, but he gives no figures
nor does he state the basis on which the
material is regarded as payable. Incident-
ally, he struck several disappointments dur-
ing his search. Twelve months or so ago
he set about tapping the unexplored ground
east of the old Elder shaft, but 278 ft. of
driving and 576 ft. of diamond-drilling have
proved no defined payable lode course. A
year ago Hancock declared that little further
ore-raising could be done in the old Moonta
mines until additional profitable material

Do you use soldering irons in your business? No
doubt you would appreciate the advantages of those
which stay hot and are free from the soot of a
heating dame. The G.E. Electric Soldering Iron
possesses these and many other advantages over the
old style. It costs but little for current, and re-
quires very little attention to be kept clean and
well tinned. An exclusive feature of this iron is
the spiral coil wire handle, which keeps remarkablv
cool, and which may be grasped close to the tip
without discomfort. Australian General Electric

Water is nature’s thirst quencher for both man
and beast, and unless your supply is pure when you
receive it, much ill-health may result. Dwellers
in the country suffer the greatest disadvantage, as
they depend mainly on tank and river water, which
very often contains impurities and vegetable matter.
One pound of Aluminoferric will clarify 2000 gal-
lons of water. It will not affect the taste, but will
give you a supply of beautifully clear and pure

tions can be made to pay.
Though the old co. has gone over £56,000
to the bad during the past 18 months, two
divs. —one of Is. and another of 2s. —have
lately been paid. The result is that, whereas
12 months ago there was a surplus of liquid
assets over liabilities of £330,218, there is
now only £267,201. But that means that
apart from the mines, mining plant and the
smelters, etc., the co. has about 335. of
readily-saleable assets for each £2 share.

It is difficult to believe that Vic. Treasurer
McPherson can be anything more than a
reluctant consenting party to the Bank of
Agriculture and Industry which Lawson pro-
poses to set up to deal with advances applied
for by secondary industries proposed to be
established in country towns, and to grant
accommodation to the man on the land. A
little extension of the powers of the Savings
Bank Commissioners in the Credit Foncier
Branch would be all that is necessary. Why
this multiplication of State banks?
Sydney City Council’s electric-supply de-
partment has not secured sufficient new funds
to provide for required extensions; so an
effort is being made to get in the balance of the
£850,000 debenture issue put on the market
six months ago. The City Treasurer is
handling the issue, the debentures being in
£lOO multiples, carrying 6 p.c. p.a. and
maturing in 10 years.

The B. H. Prop.’s Newcastle steel works
have put in a word to help along the co.’s
new issue. For the last week of September
the seven furnaces made 10,024 tous of
steel, practically half as much again as
usual. The achievement is claimed to be, a
world’s record for 60-ton furnaces.

The gas at Roma bore (Q.) has now been
shut off under a column of water, and
analyses of it are being made at the Bris-
bane University by Professor Steele. The
tests for petrol content carried• out by the
Government Analyst show it to be consider-
ably richer than the gas from most U.S.
petroleum wells. Using American standards
of pressure and temperature in the absorp-
tion tests, it is estimated that the Roma gas
will yield two pints petrol per 1000 cub. ft.
of gas at atmospheric pressure. Some of the
Californian wells profitably extracted petrol
from gas carrying .9 pint per 1000 cub. ft.
while petrol was selling at about 12 cents a
gallon. The question to be decided before
treating Roma gas is what to do with the
valuable power and illuminant which
remain after the petrol has been extracted.
Roma cannot utilise them, and it probably
means that before an absorption plant is
erected a decision will have to be made as
to how the gas can be conveyed tb indus-
trial centres like Ipswich and Brisbane. The
Mines Department has decided to continue
boring below the gas strata, but progress
will probably be slow for a period, as the
bottom 100 ft. is choked with sand, and some
difficulty is being experienced in removing
this. Although some U.S. gas bores are dry
(i.e., non-productive for petroleum), the per-
centage is small, and the boring authorities
at Roma now feel optimistic that oil will be
found below the gas.
* * * *
The bore at Marburg (Q.), which is down
over 400 ft., is held up owing to the difficulty
of obtaining casing. It is penetrating the
Walloon sandstones and .shales, which a few
miles to the south contain productive coal
measures. A sample of the sludge from the
bottom of the bore tested by the Goyernment
Analyst shows a small percentage of oil.

The recent increase in the reward offered
by the Commonwealth Government for the
discovery of oil has again induced a number
of Territorians to prospect the Victoria
River country. This part of the N.T. has
been gone over and over again by all classes
of men, including the American oil expert
Haley (1913). He returned to Darwin a
very disgusted individual. It is now 25
years since prospectors Darcy Ure and Tom
O’Connor were first startled by an old
lubra, who, on seeing them fill and light a
hurricane lamp (then a novelty in the N.T.),
exclaimed “Plenty fellow all the same that
one over there” —pointing with a stick towards
a distant range. Darcy and Tom imme-
diately packed up, and with the lubra as
guide set out for the supposed oil. All they
found was a dirty-looking hot spring. The
lubra had thought that the liquid poured
from a tieer bottle into the lamp was so hot
that it burned.

The Austral Oil Syndicate has applied to
Vic. Mines Department for a lease of 640
acres along the foreshore from the Quiet
Corner (Black Rock) to Mentone to search
for mineral oil. The strip of shoreland is four
miles long by a quarter of a mile broad, and
it is claimed that a trace of oil has been
found.
So many grossly exaggerated reports con-
cerning Hampton Plains and Mt. Monger
have been circulated during the past few
months that a general clamor has again
been raised in the West for an amendment
of the law to control the operations of pro-
moters and directors of mining ventures. In
California any person who wilfully “sub-
scribes, signs, endorses, or otherwise assents”
to the publication of any “untrue or fraudu-
lently exaggerated report, prospectus, state-
ment of operations, values, profits, expendi-
ture, or prospects or other document intend-
ing to produce or give to the shares in any
company or corporation a greater value or
less apparent market value than they really
possess” is deemed guilty of a felony and is
liable on conviction to a term not exceeding
two years’ imprisonment or a fine of up to
£lOOO. People interested in the development
of Westralia’s mineral resources are agreed
that something after the style of the Cali-
fornian law is necessary to protect the genu-
ine mining man. Recent happenings have
shaken the investing public’s faith; and
unless an effort is made to guarantee some
protection against the unscrupulous boom-
ster, funds may not be forthcoming for
mining propositions which are worth a trial.

C. P. de Jersey Grut’s report on Mutooroo
(W.A.) settles the pretensions of that show.
His summing-up agrees with the “Wild
Cat’s.” Mutooroo is a small, patchy affair.
The distribution of gold values through an
indefinite mass of lode material, says Grut.
is “most erratic and difficult to follow.”
Though good values are obtainable at
isolated points, he could find no continuous
run of them, while, except at two points,
“sampling discloses no place where stoping
would be justified.” Grut i.s severe in his
comments on the manner in which the
property has been handled ; the method of
opening up the mine, he says, has “approxi-
mated more to that employed by prospectors
than to the methodical work usually em-
ployed in development by a co.”
Following upon a number of whoops about
high values and good developments in the
Lass o’ Gowrie, the directors of that Mt.
Monger (W.A.) show obtained an indepen-
dent report which knocked the market value
of the shares down by one-half and caused
a slump in other lpcal gambling counters.
Local shareholders talk of holding a meet-
ing and demanding an explanation from the
Board; but what the directors need to
explain is why, in the face of the informa-
tion which they have had in their posses-
sion for months past, they allowed the
property to be officially boomed in the press.
The co. has secured an extension of its
option until £he end of March next year, but
not unlikely it will be abandoned before
that date.

Disappointment still dogs Hampton Areas,
Ltd. When floated in February last the co.
was considered to have good prospects of
finding something on at least three or four
of its reserved leases on Block 48, and especi-
ally on those north apd south of'the White
and Golden Hope mines. But developments
all round have been poor, and its chances as
a gold-producer are now not at all bright.
For the 12 months to February last Lake
View and Star (W.A.) treated 75,320 tons
for 20,4950 z. (fine), worth £87,401 with
gold at standard value. All-in costs called
for £106,256; nevertheless with the premium
received from the Gold Producers’ Associa-
tion the co. was able to close its books with
a profit of £13,461. At the balance there
was a liquid surplus of £48,305, almost
£23,000 of it in cash and public securities;
but shareholders got no div.. funds being
required for new plant and development. Ore
reserves were estimated at 230,607 tons,
averaging 26.35.; Hannan’s Star contribut-
ing 220,875 tons worth 25.65., Lake View
53.932 tons worth 27.85., and Chaffers 5800
tons worth 37.85. Manager Vail has proved
good shoots of ore below 2100 ft. in the old
Lake View and under 1100 ft. in Hannan’s,
and reckons that approximately 300,000 tons
averaging about 30s. can be added to ore
reserves. But to open up the bodies in the
deeper ground is going to cost something like
£30,000, when the co. can secure the neces-
sary labor. Lake View and Star did not
bother much about the Hampton scramble.
The chairman told shareholders that three
leases had been offered. “We looked at
them,” he added, “and did not waste any
more money. It cost us £126.”
* * * *
Ida H., which ran a gold show at Laver-
ton (W.A.), is nowadays interested in
Nigerian tin,- and is equipping a couple of
promising properties. The co. recon-
structed a few months ago, and no longer
labels itself a gold-mining co.
Sydney has secured a small interest in a
new Siamese tin float, the Nawng Pet, in
which Kampong Ivamunting’s general-
manager A. J. King figures. The co. is a
half-million dollar (Asiatic dollar) concern;
the vendors take 100,000 dollar shares,
350,000 have been subscribed, and the re-
maining 50,000 are held in reserve. Besides
their £11,666 share interest, the vendors—
A. J. King, F. C. Dubois and F. F. Munro —
also get £15,500 in cash. The property is
on the Ronpibon area, and so far three leases
containing 177 acres have been secured,
while applications for 1000 acres of adjoin-
ing land have been lodged. From 246 bores
put down in the three leases already secured,
F. C. Dubois estimates three million yds.
going 141 b., and four millions averaging Mb.,
or a total tin content of 2562 tons. With
metallic tin at $l2O per picul (approximately
£235 per ton) Dubois estimates the value of
production, after paying duty, etc., at
£401,800. This is to be won in seven years
by Powell’s pneumatic tail-race, which has
been developed in Maoriland gold-dredging
practice. Dubois calculates that 4d. per yd.
will be ample to cover all working and
amortisation costs, so he anticipates a net
profit of over £230,000 for the seven years,
or a return of over 50 p.c. p.a. on paid capi-
tal. Inventor G. M. Powell is to supervise
the installation of his plant, which is a
“combination and utilisation of the forces of
a jet (as in ordinary sluicing) and the
vacuum caused thereby.’’ Other properties
in Malaya are also to be equipped with
Powell plants.

The lawyers are now getting a crushing
out of Mt. Owen (N.S.W.). The Stock
Exchange cut the shares out of its list, and
that, of course, stopped the buying-in under
the rules of the Exchange. Still it didn’t
affect the contracts between buyers and sel-
lers so far as the law is concerned ; and the
question in case of non-delivery is chiefly
one of damages—how much are the buyers
entitled to get in default of delivery? That
raises the whole question of values and of
the means (if any) by which values were
elevated.
* * * *
The approaching advent of civil govern-
ment in former German New Guinea is
reviving interest in the huge gold-reef which
the Germans are believed to have discovered
in pre-war days in the Morobe district. Dur-
ing the war the military administration
rigorously carried out the agreement pro-
hibiting mining anywhere within the terri-
tory, and it was a matter of common belief
among civilian residents that Von Haber,
the German Governor, inserted this provi-
sion in the treaty of surrender signed by
himself and Holmes in order to minimise
the chances of the reef being discovered.
Rumor puts it at somewhere between the
headwaters of the Warriar River, in the
Kaiserin Augusta Range', and the spot
where the Dutch, German and British bor-
ders meet, a wild and' inaccessible tract of
country peopled by cannibalistic natives. It
is known that when the war broke out a
Gerqian steamer on its way from Europe
to Rabaul, and which was captured at Dur-
ban, had on board a large quantity of mining-
machinery, including a five-stamp battery,
consigned to the Governor of German New
Guinea.. Statements made by officials of the
old regime in Rabaul indicate that it was
intended for use in working this reef. The
Warriar River itself contains considerable
quantities of gold, and for years prospectors,
including many Australians, have searched
for the rdef from which it came. Appa-
rently, however, it was the luck of Fritz
to locate it.
The recent tin find at Pikedale (Q.) has been
reported on by the Government Geologist, but
values were disappointing. However, every
sample showed tin, so the large greisenised
body deserves further prospecting. The
Mines Department is subsidising the Bright
Hope Syndicate to prospect the ore body,
which is at present only opened up by a 35ft.
shaft and an open-cut 14ft. deep. Tin pipes
in granite practically always carry their
highest values around the periphery, but the
outer zone of this pipe has not yet been seen.
The syndicate is composed mainly of Diggers,
with a couple of experienced tin-miners
directing operations. About a dozen claims
have been pegged out surrounding the Bright
Hope.

The Anakie sapphire field (Q.) has been
quiet recently, the miners standing easy
while the Government considered whether it
is going to take a hand in marketing the
gems. There seems to be no difficulty in
placing high-class sapphires, but most of the
men have considerable quantities of medium
and poor stones, and Government interven-
tion has been sought mainly in the hope of
getting a sale for these grades. There is
abundance of water on the field, where about
500 men are at present centred.
The Tailem Bend Coal and Oil Co. (S.A.)
wants a short spur-line of a little over
three miles from the Pinnaroo line. It has
found a 57-foot mass of brown coal, has
200 tons at. grass, and has had a visit of
inspection from the State Government.
Reconstruction of the co. is probable, with
a view to operations on a larger scale.
A deposit of asbestos, reputed valuable,
has been found in the Eudunda (S.A.) dis-
tnct A go. has taken up 500 acres, is
aown do feet, and reports pressing inquiries
from all quarters—including a request (de-
clined with thanks) through the High Com-
missioner s office, from a London firm, for
an option over the whole output.

Briseis Central (Tas.) hopes to be able
to start tm-sluicing at an early date on the

down of its pumping station have compelled
±ioy a L Cr e °rge tin (Tas.) to get in new capi-
tal. The 50,000 shares of 10s. Gd. are bein-
increased to 325. Gd.

l )ros P ec tor operating on behalf of a
Melbourne syndicate has located bitumen in
the Tullah district (Tas.), near Mt. Peli-
can. The so-called albertite is rated a heavy
producer of petroleum and oils, and the dis
coverer estimates the deposit as worth £6
per ton at grass. A co. is being formed to
develop the property.
* * * #
Duco tin (Tas.) has struck trouble and
is seeking Government assistance. It was
thought to be a sluicing proposition, but
the ground has proved hard and cementy,
necessitating crushing machinery, which the
Government is being asked to provide.

A good Australian went over the hill when
O’Hara Wood died in Melbourne. A Queens-
lander by birth, O’Hara Wood was a bar-
rister, a writer of fine verse and a good all-
round athlete. Gifted with a keen sense of
humor and a penchant for repartee, he was
a born Bohemian, fond of a good dinner, a
good story and good company. His sons
Arthur and Pat were distinguished tennis-
players. Arthur was killed at the war, and
his father was never quite the same after-
wards.
For the defence in the trial of Field, the
rich squatter and carcase-butcher, charged
with conspiring with another to beat the
Federal Income-tax, Shand, K.C., held the
fattest brief the Sydney Bar has had in a

marked 1000 guineas, and refreshers ran to
£5O a day.
Billy Hughes informed them at the Mel-
bourne Show banquet that he had been told
a champion ram in the pens had been named
after him. Billy declared that he regarded
this as a great com-
pliment. Nobody

ram. His opinion
must remain un-
spoken. But when
the animal was
shown to a promi-
nent member of the
Opposition, and
the latter was told
what the he-sheep

the politician said:
“Why, what’s the
matter with him?”

Governor Allardyce. of the Speck, has
done more to extend the limits of the Brit-
ish Empire than most cocked hats. He was
Governor of the Falklands when it was dis-
covered that the seas round South Georgia,
the South. Shetlands and other southern
islands were the world’s greatest whaling-
ground. Argentina and Chile laid claim to
the sterile regions, but Allardyce got busy,
and Britain promptly annexed them, and
after a little grumbling the Republics
accepted the situation. When Yon Spee’s Ger-
man fleet hove up off the Falklands after its
Coronel victory, a woman on an outlying
farm spotted the enemy and sent a mounted
messenger post haste to Port Stanley. Allar-
dyce passed the news on to Admiral Sturdee,
and the rest is history.
Mayor McSwiney, of Cork, started hunger-
striking on August 12. On August 30 he
“collapsed, and his family was called to his
bedside,” but on Oct. 3, the 52nd day, he
was still defying the tyrannous Sassenach
to make him eat. It is a greater fast than
Elijah’s, but a suspicion grows that the
insidious alien Government has been put-
ting something in the wather.
T. J. Ryan, of Queensland and West Syd-
ney, is now a horny-handed squatter as well
as a toiler who earns his bread by the sweat
of his brief. He and his wife are two among
the eight registered shareholders in a

including banking and insurance, and “any

A N. S. Wales Supreme Court Judge has

take charge of them. Many people will have
sympathy for both parties.' Before George-
son handled wheat his life was mostly de-
voted to oil; he came to Australia as sales
manager for the Commonwealth Oil Cor-
poration. It was his connection with oil
that took him to Java; and it was that
acquaintance with “the East” which pre-
sently inveigled him into wheat-dealings. He
was a shy, sensitive man, with a wide repu-
tation for probity (some of the best-known
people in Sydney and Melbourne had
engaged him to confidentially report upon
obscure or doubtful propositions) ; and
then came Justice Pring’s Commission to
inquire into Geo.rgeson’s own obscure and
doubtful propositions. Mrs. Georgeson was
an Irish girl: she has not been more than
eight or 10 years in Australia.
Hua-hes, riding a Defence Department

nag while riding up Constitution Hill, and
received the injuries from which he died
three days later. But Hughes will never
be thrown riding up Constitution Hill. He
prefers the War Precautions track.

of Canterbury. As Sec. for Works, he had
charge of the construction of the first rail-
ways under Julius Vogel’s scheme and also
of the Lyttelton Harbor contract.
, Captain W T illie Stutt, who flew off in his
plane to look for the Amelia J. schooner and
went missing, is a son of the William Stutt
who was member for South Grant in the
Vic. Assembly from 1567 till 1871. (He
had three tries afterwards for that elec-
torate, Mornington and Barwon respectively,
but didn’t land a winner.) The most sen-
sational thing the elder Stutt did was to beat
Graham Berry for South Grant in 1867.
Berry had not then “arrived” as a leader:
he did not get his first taste of office (under
J. A. MacPherson) till 1870, and did not
become the people’s tribune till 1875. Stutt
was the chief apostle of Bung in those days.
What he said went. Until the last (he
lived till about 85 and reared a second
family) Stutt stuck to a house with a bar
in it, and found it much more profitable than
politics.
Barrister O’Hara Wood, who died in Mel-
bourne last week, promised more than he
performed, for he won the Perry Scholarship
at Melbourne University and was still a
very young man when he achieved his ambi-
tion to write a novel—-“ Mortgaged Years.”
The likeable character of the author
expressed itself in his nom de plume, “R. K.
Dee.” A few years ago he published some
verses and other trifles under his own name.
His prefaced admission of how he had grati-
fied his vanity in composing the graceful
little verses was sufficient apology for pub-
lishing them by subscription. And more re-
cently he published other verses in pocket-
booklet form.
Arthur J. Hare will leave off being N. S.
Wales Under Sec. for Bands this month. He
has been a “safe” permanent head; probably
he realised, after reflecting on .the troubled
history of the department in Crick’s day,
that the “permanent” head can easily make
his job very impermanent. He gave the
work of the Lands so. much of.his attention
that he had none to spare for anything else ;
and nobody was much surprised when in the
earlier days of the war German musicians
were engaged to play “God Save” at a send-
off to Lands officials who had enlisted.
There are at least three other former Under-
Secs. of Lands to welcome Hare into his
honestly-earned retirement.
Rod Quinn is going to welcome another
volume of his verse at the end of this month ;
and admirers of this gentle poet will wel-
come it still more. Angus and Robertson
are bringing the baby into the world.
Lawyer George Godfrey, who died in Mel-
bourne in August, was much wealthier than
was suspected. He left £149.000 to his
widow, children and other relatives. No
mention is made of any big bequest to his
hobby, the Melbourne Hospital, but he was
good to it while he lived.
Freddy North, Westralia’s most affable
and decorative Under-Secretary, has been
superannuated, at his own request, after 34
years’ service. A youngster from Rugby,
where he played for two years in the school
eleven, he reached Perth in 188(5 and mar-
ried (at 21) a sister-in-law of John Forrest,
whose secretary he was for 10 years.
Because he was English and fond of music
Governor Robinson (“Fiddler Bill”) made
him his aidy-kong, and in 1902 the Forrest
influence steered Freddy into his Under-
Secretaryship, although the big man had
departed for Melbourne by that time. One
of his ancestors was the weary cynic who
helped George 111. to lose the United States.
Many Queensland mayors are on the hust-
ings, mostly in an endeavor to put Fihelly
and Theodore out in the cold. Maxwell,
Brisbane’s Mayor, has survived the National
plebiscite for Toowong, and will doubtless
step into the cast-off shoes of E. H. Macart-
ney, and Jimmy Davey, ex-mayor of South
Brisbane, is fighting ex-Senator Myles Fer-
ricks for that centre. R. E. Hartley, Mayor
of Rockhampton, triumphed in a keen plebis-
cite for Iveppel, and will go close to beating
Larcombe. In Charters Towers Dave
Guthrie and in Townsville W. 11. Green
have worn the local substitute for mayoral
rabbitskins. Labor looks to recover Mar-
anoa through C. W. Conroy, Mayor of
Roma, who has a big personal following:
Spencer, the P.P.U. man, only won it from
J. H. McDougall by a handful of votes when
Hunter left for London.
Of a man who found sermons in stones: —
Walter Howchin, F.G.S., who is relinquishing his
job as Lecturer in Geology at Adelaide Uni., was
originally a parson ; but when his studies in palaeon-
tology upset the theological chariot he gave up the
pulpit and made his hobby his profession. All his
old students will remember “Wally” with affection.
Much of his work in the field was of a pioneer character,
and he it was who discovered the famous glaciated
stone in the bed of the Inman River and the no less
interesting “erratic” at Hallett’s Cove —both S.A.
localities. From this and other data he was able
to assert the existence in remote times of a high
granite mountain chain lying to the south of Vic.
and S. Aus., which, shedding its snow and ice at
different periods, caused the glacial erosion to be
seen in S. Aus. and Western Vic. He bestowed his
name on several of his fossils, and when, during a
lecture, he came in due course to So-and-so How-
chini, his appreciative students usually treated him
to a few seconds’ cheering while he beamed mildly
over his glasses in a semi-disapproving' manner.
last week in Adelaide, F. J. Lewis
(74), iron and timber merchant and con-
tractor. With the brothers Fry he long ago
laid city and country tram-lines in S. Aus.,
with M. C. Davies he was in the first open-
cut contract in Broken Hill, and with F. W.
S. Reid he constructed the Menzies (W.A.)
reservoir and a whole clutch of Westralian
and Soustralian jetties.

Aaron Aarons.
Charles Workman (the Administrator, not
the actor) once said that the British ser-
vice in the South. Pacific draws from Aus-
tralia some “absolutely priceless fellows.”
The latest of them is F. B. Phillips, a Mel-
bourne lawyer who has gone to the Solo-
mons as Lands Commissioner to straighten
out a tangle of land-ownership claims and
counter-claims. Though Phillips has a lame
leg, he managed, after a lot of battling, to
get the recruiting-officer to accept him, and
was within a fortnight of going to the Front
as a flying man when the Armistice put an
end to that job.
Colonel Cameron, who represents Brisbane
in the House of Reps., belongs to one of
the old Scottish pioneer families of Queens-
land. His grandfather, following in the
footsteps of the Aberdeenshire Leslies and
then pushing on beyond, was the first white
man to settle in the Barcaldine district,
which he named after the old place in Scot-
land. Later the station was sold to the
clan to which Senator Fairbairn belongs,
and the Camerons moved farther west to-
wards Longreach. Colonel Cameron saw a
deal of service in the war, and was also in
earlier arguments.
John A. Huybers, who died at Athens
lately, aged (!0, was born in Tasmania, but
went to Paris to study art and never came
hack. Like John McCormack, he migrated to
the U.S.A. and was naturalised. In Boston
lie ran up against a Greek lad who was
cleaning boots but had artistic gifts. Though
u w l as ?’ t vei T flush himself John A. adopted
the lad and pushed him ahead in the art
world. This contract made Huybers a Hellen-
ist. and he went to Greece as special
correspondent of the New York Evening
Post. He became a persorssl friend of Veni-
zelos who wrote a glowing obituary notice
tor the Athens newspapers; moreover the
Greek Government has decided to put up a
monument to him.
: Prof. Ernest Scott’s new book,
Men and Thought in Modern History,”
shows incidentally how little certain British
statesmen deserved to have their names im-
mortalised by Australia. Melbourne, just at
the time his name was being given to an
infant city, was telling Canada’s Governor
that his only worry about losing that pro-
vince was that it might affect his Govern-
ment. “The final separation of these colonies
might possibly not be of material detriment
to the interests of the mother country, but
it is clear that it would be a serious blow .
to the honor of Great Britain, and certainly
would be fatal to the character and existence
of the Administration under which it took
place. Melbourne might possibly be re-
membered in history as the hard-swearing,
fatherly Minister of the girl queen; but
Glenelg would be utterly forgotten now if his
name had not been used for S. Australia’s
front door. It wjs he who thought Britain
had “colonies enough,” and would have pre-
vented the settlement of both Victoria and
S. Aus. if he could.
THE LAMENT OF THE SUSCEPTIBLE
SOFTGOODS MAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Alas, I’m old; I’m quite worn out;
By newer, fresher stock outdone,
Though I was splendid stuff and stout;
And soon floorwalker Death will shout
Inexorably: “Forward one!”
I shrink not: dye and die we must;
There’ll be no better bargain tabled
Than this poor remnant who’ll be just
Consigned to Messrs. Worms and Dust,
Packed in a little box and labelled.
’Tis not my fate that makes me mourn,
But that of luxuries I cherished—
Ladies and lace to darkness borne,
Sweet skirts from life so harshly torn,
Silks that with passing years have perished.
(Soft as the monologues of doves
The echo in my fnem’ry lingers
Of delicate, recherche loves
With dainty fingers made for gloves,
Expensive gloves just made for fingers!)
And when I muse, as muse I must,
I thrill with strange, unhappy passion
To think how coldly Time has thrust
Those lovely bodies in the dust,
Those bodices right out of fashion.
The lips, the sleeves of other days!
The waists, as once they used to wear themY
The old-time girls, the old-time stays!
Heigho ! the ghosts my mu sings raise—
My faded heart can scarcely bear them !

another protracted and arduous journey without
assured danger to his health.
We propose that if he has by then recovered from
the fatigues of his present labors the visit now post-
poned shall be accomplished next winter.
When Pa wrote that the Exhausted Invalid
was spending his mornings riding Racehorses
at Randwick, his afternoons hitting a Ball
with a Racket in a city gymnasium, and his
nights and early mornings in unceasing devo-
tion to the Jazz. But he bore up manfully
under the Frightful Strain, and hid his
Wrecked Constitution behind an appearance
of Rude Health.
“Tin Hat”: Melbourne’s most smellful
suburb recently raised its voice in strong
protest against the local enterprise of the
Cockbill firm, which proposes to spend a
large sum in enlarging and bringing up to
date its boiling-down works, into which the
dead horses of Melbourne disappear. At an
inquiry each side produced a health expert.
One swore that the proposed boilery would
be prejudicial to health. The other swore
equally hard that it would have no such
effect. Then the firm led a stout trump in
the person of its foreman. He testified that
he had commenced to work among the
defunct horses 15 years ago. Then a martyr
to gastritis and weighing only lOst. 71b., he
now enjoys perfect health and tips the beam
at over 15 stone. If you see a string of
limousines running down from Toorak to
Footscray you’ll know Sassiety has dropped
to the dead-horse cure.
So impressed was the director of a grocery
co. Avith some strong cheese he had got hold
of that he put it in the best place in the
window at a branch place in Brunswick
(Vic.) and labelled it “Something choice —
try it.” Accepting the invitation the health
inspector popped in and got a bit. The sequel
was a prosecution and some hard swearing.
“Offensive to taste and smell” and a “mass
of putrescence” were the allegations for the
prosecution ; but two front-rank doctors and
as many produce experts declared that there
was nothing wrong. On the weight of evi-
dence and not on personal check the beaks
wiped the case off the slate and ordered the
Brunswick council to pay five guineas costs
for not knowing the old cook’s saying that
everything goes bad except cheese.

“Sixenate”: As strange as the people who
have blind faith in spiritualism are those
who boil over at the mention of spooks.
The fact that Bloggs likes to believe that the
ghost of his departed aunt can appear to
him and eat chocolates should not make
Bangs angry; but it does, and an army
of Bangses are getting ready to hold counter-
demonstrations when Conan Doyle cuts
loose. So far, no outstanding opponent of
Sludge, the medium, has come to light, but
a couple of visiting illusionists have been
approached. Hoskins, a conjurer who made
war upon spiritualism in the days when
Justice Windeyer took a lively interest in
the doings of Cissie and other chocolate-
eating spirits, used to draw crowded houses
to entertainments at which he produced
the whole box and dice of fashionable
seances, and another Hoskins may be dis-
covered. After Hoskins had dematerialised
his last ghost, a boy used to come on the
stage and announce that the spirit was
thirsty and demanded beer. The absorp-
tion of that beer by a substantial spook
who had successfully dodged the vigilance
of the usual “committee selected by the audi-
ence” was wont to be the hit of the evening.

“He appears to have been doing a fairly
extensive betting business over the ’phone,”
.said the prosecuting officer at Sydney Cen-
tral Police Court.
The subject of his
remarks had two tele-
phones and a large
quantity of other
evidence as to the
methods by which he
pursued his calling.
What this sort of
thing means is that,
in order to show a
profit, the P.M.G.’s
Department is conniv-
ing at the breaking of
the State laws against
betting-shops. That
the officials are in a
position to know the
business that is done

shown by the prompti-
tude with which they
cut off private tele-
phones in certain
areas when .sub-
scribers allow their in-
struments to be used in competition with
the Department’s own slot machines.

“Callan Park” has another idea:—
It is significant that the Zionist emissary should
have met with less encouragement in Sydney than
in any other part of Australia. Sydney contains
more Jews and richer (and hence, probably, brainier)
Jews than any other city in the Commonwealth.
A thinking Jew can have only one reason for paying
money to exile a fellow-Hebrew to a horrible place
like Palestine, namely, fear of competition on the
part of his compatriot. Hitherto, logically enough,
it is the Christians who have attempted the feat.
In the Middle Ages the English deported every
identifiable Jew in the kingdom, and they did it in
such a hurry that for weeks afterwards the damp
corpses of citizens with rococo noses and passionate
lips kept making their appearance on the Goodwins
and along the Kentish coast between Dover and
Ramsgate. Russia and the “Near East” generally
have had their frequent pogroms; and in France
and Germany anti-Semite parties are quite fashion-
able.
That Christians are. not swamping the subscription
lists of the New Jerusalem movement is no less
remarkable than that certain Englishmen should be
the bitterest opponents of Sinn Fein. Regarded as
a nuisance, a dangerous competitor, and a menace
to repose and harmony, the international Irishman
is at least the equal of the international Jew. 'i'.ie
genial, money-scorning Hibernian is largely a lying
creation of Charles Lever. In real life the Irishman
and the Jew stand pretty well at “love all” in the
NATURE'S SHABBY TRICK.
BEAUTY: “Oh, he's such a pet! Do you
really think white cats are unlucky ?”
THE BEAST: “Yes, the mice can see them
coming too easily.”
great game of cash-absorption. In politics the
Irishman holds a commanding position all over the
English-speaking world; and it is the commonest
thing to hear futile complaints uttered by persons
of English, Scotch and Welsh descent that “the Irish
have all the good Government jobs.” Yet this eager,
restless race remains dissatisfied, and wherever a
row occurs there is an Irishman in it.
Whom do we find, in communities like Australia,
agitating on behalf of the New Ireland—a land
capable of supporting 20,000,000 of these
trouble-making and acquisitive people in place
of the 5,000,000 which it holds at present ?
Bro. Barton, W.G.M. ? Tom Henley, M.L.A. ?
Not at all. It is the Irish and not their so-called
enemies who want to see Irishmen leave the big
banking accounts, the high positions and the easy
jobs which they have wrested from the Sassenach
and settle in a cold, wet land where they will be
driven to compete with one another. Just as the
Jew who is not blinded by sentiment says to the
Zionist emissary, “I will not give a shilling to oust
Jews from an environment where they find it so
easy to prosper,” so Bro. Barton, Mr. Henley and
the rest ought to be the warmest upholders of Irish
lt is merely a matter of developing
the reasoning faculties of such enthusiasts up to a
certain moderate standard, and every Orange Lodge
must become a centre of Sinn Fein propaganda.

A party of Maoriland M’s.P. lately visited

At Cook Island in particular the party met

it was added that with a couple of buckets
of onions he might make soup.

“Rosalie”: The Prince does not know
what he missed. I was among those present
on a Saturday afternoon at a “sing sing” that
was got up specially in his honor, and car-
ried through in .spite of his absence. The big
parade-ground in front of A.H.Q., Rabaul,
was thronged with gay, dancing bands from
the numerous tribes over which the Union
Jack has floated since 1914. All the white
population turned out and bravely listened
to the awful noises made by the “orchestra,”
the big basses being hollowed-out logs and
the piccolos diabolical reed whistles. Some
thousands of Black Brother applauded the
performance, and a hundred or so of tul tuls
or chiefs were very much bored by it all.
The star turn of the day did not come on
until late, but was worth the antecedent
agony. The artists were well covered in
grass dresses, reminiscent of the crinoline,
of many colors, and the astonishing head-
gears included an enormous creation nearly
sft. high, made chiefly of feathers and em-
bellished with sundry superb birds-of-para
dise.

“Pip Tok”: The writer of “The Rifle in
Modern War” (B. 9/9/’2O) scored a bull
when he emphasised the fact that athletic-
sports develop military qualities. That the
Defence Department realises this is shown
in the syllabus of the new Central School
of Physical Training. The staff of this
school has at present a roving commission,
and is conducting a series of courses in the
State capitals.
This will continue
until the school is
housed on the lines
of the Aldershot
Headquarters Gym-
nasium. The cur-
riculum embraces
Swedish exercises,
and a great deal of
recreational work,
such as hockey,
basket ball, base-
ball and swimming.
The State Educa-
tion Departments
send alo n g lec-
turers who give
two or three dis-
courses on teaching
methods, especially
as they apply to
the adolescent boy ;
and, in addition,
the St. John Ambu-
lance Association
and the lioyal Life
Saving Society co-
operate so that
students may
qualify for the cer-
tificates issued by
those bodies, as
well as that
awarded by the
Central School. At
present the school is training officers and
n.c.o.’s of the permanent forces, who will in-
struct the C.M.F. “areas.” Next year courses
will be held for Citizen and Senior Cadet
officers and for selected teachers from the
State services. Area-officers are now form-
ing citizen committees, on which various
sporting bodies are represented, with the
idea of fostering athletics among the cadets;
and that ought to interest both boy and
parent in the training.
“Mr. Justice Ocky”: It is amazing
how composed and silent some Yic. Jay
Pays can be when circumstances call
for something quite different. The other
day two of them listened to a hor-
rible story about 14 half-starved and
ill-clothed people being cooped up in a small
house at Langwarrin. Three young men of
this household were before the beaks for
stealing food, and others for receiving it.
The Bench refrained from making one word
of even mild comment on the fact that six
of the 14 were infants boarded out by the
Neglected Children’s Department to this
home of squalor and misery ! I groped my
way from the silent court in blank aston-
ishment.

A SONG OF SUBURBAN MOWERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
This is the song that the lawnmowers make
When the suburbs on Sunday from, slumber awake,
And the'beautiful wbrld after labor is still,
And to wandering breezes the red roses thrill.
Mow down the grass ! Mow down the grass!
It’s ever across the same garden we pass,
To and fro purring with sharp teeth of steel,
Methodically we partake of the meal.
Then chew it and bite it and make the plot neat —
We can’t have our grass a disgrace to the street!
Mow down the lawn ! Mow down the lawn,
Fresh with the dew and the kisses of dawn.
Rut what is the dawn and a little wet kiss?
We’ve no time to waste upon nonsense like this.
For Monday comes fast and the work must be done—
In the bustle of life who may glance at the sun?
Mow down the blades! Mow down the blades!
The grass may be green, but it withers and fades.
Why worry to grow since you’re destined to die
When the weeks or the months or the years have
gone by?
We are cynical folk and this wisdom we’ve got
Through paying much heed to the same garden plot.
Each Sunday’s the same as the one gone before;
This orderly life, though it’s rather a bore,
Is the only existence that’s proper and good,
And the eager young grass doesn’t live as it should ;
Pushing up from the earth it would fain reach the
skies,
And it strives and it hopes to the day that it dies!
This is the song that the lawnmowers sing,
But the grass is alive with the soul of the Spring;
And what though the suburbs may trim and may
shear,
The grass will be gay in the youth of the year!
VICTORIA.

THE LOST TREASURE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ ‘She never seemed satisfied, and wanted to go
away to service,’ said Henry Gustave Anderson, sales-
man, of Ultimo, in seeking a decree from his
wife, Ruby, on the ground of desertion. She left one
day while he was at work, and he had not seen her
since.” —Sydney Divorce report.
Life as a wife in fair Ultimo Ruby loathed.
Afternoon teas and the visits of clericals
Bored her so stiff that they grew unendurable.
Came a mad hour when she felt she must chuck it
all.
Grabbing her hat she made straight for a city tram,
Crying: “I’m off to get work as a general.”
Wild was the thrill it occasioned in Ultimo.
People rushed frenziedly after the vehicle
Shouting: “Stop, Ruby, and go into service here.”
Futile, alas! were their efforts to deal with her;
Round a far corner the tram she had boarded fled.
Ruby was never again seen in Ultimo.
Week after week in the Saturday newspapers,
Now in the “Wanteds” and now in the “Missing
Friends,”
Servantless householders tried to get hold of her.
Husbands still dream as they wash up the dinner-
plates,
Wives brood wjrile scrubbing or hanging the washing
out,
Fiercely resentful, concerning the might-have-been.
Somewhere, they know, there exists a phenomenon:
One who is eager to take on a servant’s job.
Still, what’s it matter, since none can discover her ?

“Copabella”: Vic. State Government’s
comment upon the news that an inmate of
Geelong’s infirmary-cam-benevolent asylum,
a twice-convicted sodomist and recorded sex-
maniac for .'hi years, had tampered indecently
with a seven-year-old convalescent girl, was
to notify the hospital authorities that it
was transferring to their care six more
senile prisoners from the local gaol. The
authorities protested mildly—Geelong is far
too respectable to say or do anything with
a bite in it —but the Government retorted
that by the terms of its grant to the infirm-
asylum the decrepit lags just had to be taken,
and no —- nonsense about it. The infamy
of throwing little girls and ancient satyrs
together in one institution apparently doesn’t
matter even on the day before a general elec-
tion.
“Spare Corp”: The stranded Aussies in
London who are now agitating for repatria-
tion to Australia may include a Digger who,
towards the end of things, applied for a
passage to _ Australia for his “dependent
aunt." An inspection of his records showed
that he had a wife in Australia whose mis-
conduct had led to the cancellation of her
allotment. He Was offered a passage to
Australia for “family reasons”— i.e., to get a
divorce—but he preferred to remain fighting.
Then, after his Blighty leave, he made an
allotment in favor of a woman in England,
and boldly applied for a fiancee’s passage to
HIS NATURAL FOOD.
“Cyril says that if he doesn’t marry Mabel
he’ll eat his hat.”
“Well, probably if he devoured the straw
one he wouldn’t find it unpalatable.”
Australia, explaining that he intended to
marry the lady when he got his -divorce.
After the shocked authorities had rejected
his application, he tried to get a free trip
home for a “dependent sister,” and after
that for a “dependent aunt.” Failing each
time, he secured the deletion of his name
from numerous boat-rolls, and finally de-
serted.
“Refresher” on Some Wasted Lives: —
Once a barrister always a barrister. An inefficient
solicitor turns usurer or hotel-broker or house-agent;
or if he has some cash to play with he may become
a company-promoter, and tear more money off the
public in a year than he would make in ten out of
Costs. But the barrister rarely tries any other call-
ing—that of M.L.A. of course excepted as a mishap
which may occur to any man —and if he does go in
for journalism, as a few do, he either runs it con-
jointly with a Bar practice, or returns to the Bar
after a while. In those States where the professions
still remain distinct there are patient, middle-aged
incompetents who hurry daily to “Chambers,” yet
will never earn a living wage. Supported by their
families or their wives they represent the only large-
sized leisured class that Australia possesses. Of
course they get briefs occasionally when they are
related to solicitors or have a pull with some big
business firm. But none except the cruelly-
deceived are represented by them in court. In one
Australian State there is an elderly possessor of a
wig and gown who is said to have worn the garments
in open court but once. A member of his family
went to law and suggested that it would look well
and perhaps do no great harm if Hector Augustus
were given a junior brief. This is an extreme case,
of course, but there are scores whose opportunities
are little greater, nor ever will be. Many of them
would have made passable farmers or orchardists or
carpenters/;with prospects of graduating into master-
builders) or storekeepers, but they are faced by a
fatal obstacle. The Bar, theoretically, is a “gentle-
man’s profession.” In point of fact, there are very
few “gentlemen” in it nowadays. Nevertheless, those
concerned struggle to keep up the old English tra-
dition, which was always as out of place in this
part of the world as a footman in knee breeches, and
which since the Peace arrived, with its multifarious
problems, has become a mild offence like an able-
bodied beggar, or a Society ex-beauty who insists
that a woman is not necessarily too old at 45 to
become a respondent.

••Snell” : A philanthropic Melbourne man
who specialises in kids took a tribe from
an institution, with a few others, to picnic
in the bush on a recent line day.
went to chaperon the gang, and big motor-
cars delivered the goods on the banks of a
beautiful creek under flowering wattles, and
a great day was spent without mishap. It
was not till he had got his little lot back to
Melbourne .that the good man's difficulties
commenced; then, after going the rounds,
re-distributing his guests, he found to his
amazement that he had three kids over who
had no discoverable parents, and whom
nobody was willing to accept! The. young-
sters were all under four and could give no
cogent account of thdmselves, and it was not
till next day when two distracted sets of
Cxippsland parents arrived on the scene with
serious charges of kidnapping and body-
snatching that the mystery of the unearned
increment was explained.
“1489”: April 23, 1915, found our outfit
on board the troopship Armadale in Lemnos
Harbor practising, amongst other things
acrobatic feats on swinging rope-ladders and
the manning of boats preparatory to the Gal-
lipoli picnic on the following Sunday. That
uight I and two others were on
horse-picket away down in the
bowels of the boat. At 2 a.m.
“Char,” our 0.G., came nosing
round. , ,1 spotted the wink of the
torch at the head of the ladder
and challenged. Sid and Jerry,
my two mates, were asleep in the
feed-bin covered with some bags.
While I was being interrogated
about a lame horse of the colonel’s,
one of the two boys groaned and
muttered in his sleep. “Char”
wheeled in the direction of the
sound, and, thrusting the torch
into the rexesses of the bin, de-
manded, “Wossinthere?” “Second
and third reliefs, sir,” I replied.
Up went the old hen’s feathers.
“Here! Gettup outa that!” he
growled, tearing the rugs off the
recumbent figures. “What the
devil do you mean by it?” Slowly
the pair arose, blinking at the
light. Rated further, they pro-
tested that they saw no harrii in roosting in
the feed-bin. That tore it completely.
“Harm !” he snorted. “How the devil would
you like it if a bally horse slept in your
frying-pan V”
“J.E.” : A recognised feature of eity life in
some parts of Asia is the brawling, bawling
woman on the housetop. Her presence on the
flat roof simply means that her cup of grum-
piness is full, so she has gone aloft to blow
off steam. As long as her voice holds out
she goes it strong, dashing family skeletons
about: telling of the alleged sins, vices,
deformities and guilty secrets of her family
or whatever family the row is about; digging
up the corpse of Shame with her teeth ; and
prancing like a spook from the Gay Necro-
polis with her hair and the rags of every-
body's reputation flying to the four winds.
When she is emptied to the last rag and
the last curse, Ruth the Moabitess comes
down refreshed and proceeds to boil the
rump chops off the goat for dinner. Nobody
has listened to her ; nobody has believed her;
hardly anybody has even looked at her. I
am reminded of the Rose of Sharon’s per-
formance when I read that Judd, in Sydney
Domain on Sunday, called Storey a “scab”
or a prize “crawler,” and went on about
him for an hour with language that woke
un the bear at the Zoo across the water
and made the ostrich turn pale about the
tail; also that Storey replied at great length
in the papers on Tuesday and refused in
a whole column to take any notice of Judd.
Judd is. I believe, an unproductive creature
soured by the public contempt which leaves
him always at or near the bottom of the
poll. A St. Bernard dog climbing a tree is
a brilliant success compared with Judd try-
ing to get up that poll. Storey is the man

who promised to do £50,000,000 worth of
things with 2d. or so —his activities were to
be ‘limited only by the supply of labor.”
as money was no object. So he has back-
slidden, as an archangel would have to do
in the circumstances, and his apologies for
his backslidderiness are unworthy of kinder-
garten diplomacy. Storey and Judd are just
about all that the pair of them say both of
them are—and what if they are? If they
would buy a skirt and a hairpin and a flat
roof and an Arabic dictionary apiece, and
make a public appearance at the top of their
respective voices as the two Witches of
Lndor, they would be pleasantly reminiscent
of Bagdad or some such den of old romance.

“Ex-Dig.” : The A.I.F. soldier carried his
gambling habits right into the front line.
If a pay occurred in that exciting spot small
two-up schools promptly formed in a part
of they trench, and the poker pupils got busy.
On one occasion a poker-school was broken
up by a shell landing on the parapet and
making a casualty of one of the players.
His cobber inspected the dead man’s hand
and sighed : “Poor Bill! He had stiff luck.
He was holding a straight flush.” A curious
gamble devised by one money-seeking Digger
was the making of a book regarding the
hymns to be sung at church parades. “Fight
the Good Fight,” “Onward, Christian Sol-
diers,” and “Lead Kindly Light” were always
at short odds; but once a well-backed out-
sider got home (the padre’s batman had
betrayed the stable secret), and the book-
maker “took the knock.”
“D.E.”: Charming is the spectacle of Dr.
Mannix indignantly denying that he is a
“firebrand sowing seeds of dissension between
England and Ireland.” It sets me recalling
the still loftier flight of that other emotional
Celt, W. M. Hughes, when he was Labor
Prime Minister and was parting company
with the red-raggers: “In the name of the
Labor party I cast you out, like devils out
of swine.”
“H.M.”: Got a whiff of the old camp-
canteen atmosphere when passing a yard
adjoining a city factory at the lunch-hour
yesterday. A monotonous voice droning
“Eyes down and look in! Number one,
Kelly’s eye, clicketty-click—66, legs 11, num-
ber 9 —medicine and duty,” led me to take
a look over the fence: and there I saw' a
game of “house” in full swing. It is unat-
tractive now; but in camp abroad the simple
gamble gave the soldier something to help
him forget the quality of the Government
ale. And yet, encountering it again. I felt
a strong inclination to take a card and
look out for “Top of the house —90. 40 —
four-oh. and away we go, 13—the Devil’s
\\n, while I “sweated on the top line.”
t must be the appeal of the old times that
makes those Australian citizens take to it
again.

Man Milliner”: The managing-director
of one of Sydney’s biggest fluff-stores has
claimed that his firm’s margin of profit “was
small—barely sufficient for the
development and extension of
the business.” Well, take some
concrete instances. A pair of
evening slippers. containing
(say) 10s. worth of leather,
-10 s. worth of grey brocade, and
sundries (outside value, another
10s.), is on sale at £8 Ss. A
rush-straw hat, dyed black, with
a patent-leather bow and some
tulie, is 525. Od. The same hat
is on sale, untrimmed, further
down the street at Bs. lid.
Other hats, made locally from
overseas models, are £7 17s. Od.,
£8 Bs. and 10 guineas. When
ospreys and similar rare fea-
thers were allowable there may
have been some reason for such
prices; but to-day the intrinsic
value of the fitments is absurdly
small. “Simple even-
ing frocks” are 25
anil 30 guineas, and
the more ornate ones
hover around the 100-
guinea mark. Now,
it may be admitted
that there is a justifi-
cation for such prices.
The vulgar are willing
to pay them. In fact,
they like it. Their
recompense is the
satisfaction they gain
from telling their
friends where they got
and what they gave
tor. their garments. Like the fabled eel
they delight in being skinned. And who are
Flu If Bros, that they should deny- them the
pleasure? But to suggest that the job is
being skimped in any way is sheer mock-
modesty.

“Sixenate”: “The Girl Who Believed
What People Told Her” will be an appro-
priate title if a recent divorce case is filmed.
The girl had married Jones while on a visit
to Sydney, and was recalled from her honey-
moon at Ivatoomba by a telegram that her
mother was dying. When she reached home
—home was at Helensburgh—she discovered
that the wire had been sent as a ruse by an
impassioned youth named Tuckwell, who
informed her that the marriage with Jones
was invalid, as both parties had made false
declarations about their ages. Somehow it
seemed necessary that she should have a
valid husband, so she married Tuckwell; but,
when Tuckwell’s sister assured her that
Jones was the legal spouse, she returned to
Jones. Apparently no one was seriously
annoyed about these complicated proceedings

until the lady quarrelled with Jones, who
thereupon denounced her as a bigamist. The
Judge intimated that she was wedded to
prison for 12 months, and she was preparing
to proceed to her new matrimonial quarters
when he added that the sentence would be
suspended on good behavior—which, pre-
sumably, means abstention from further com-
plications of the connubial sort.
NECESSARY TEMPTATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Rev. Dr. Milne, precentor of the Anglican
Cathedral, Adelaide, opposing prohibition, declares
that “if people read the Bible aright they will find
tlmt they have been put into the world to be
tempted.”
We’re sent into this world below,
Like Adam, to be tempted ;
And from this penalty I’ve no
Desire to be exempted.
And that is why the barley bree
I have them range in front of me,
And all my will-power wielding
I fight the liquor’s wicked lure,
And when I've got it beaten, sure,
I’m justified in yielding.
Tatt.’s tempts me in the self-same way,
And so do pretty women.
The latter sphere my moral sway
I find extremely dim in.
But daily 1 am learning now
To meet temptation, and somehow
To just a little numb it;
But hope with Milne I’ll never be
A quite successful pharisee,
And wholly overcome it!

of the best.” When the boss got his second wind,
he reckoned that his place was as good as any

5 ■ S ° OQ -
“D.D.”: “Wart” (B. S/7/’2O) is right.
Adobe, or mud, houses will last in Australia, and
in these days of high cost of building should receive
consideration. Over 40 years ago a number of these
houses were built at St. Mary’s, near Penrith
(N.S.W.), the largest structure being the hotel, oppo-
site the railway station, called the Shane’s Park
Hotel, after the late John Harris’s estate nearby.
The pub was locally and affectionately known as the
Mud. House. The hotel is still there, but whether
any of the original- building remains I cannot say.
These adobe houses were erected in the warm months
without a mould or frame, the mixture—of red
clayey mud and fine straw —being built up, smoothed
off and allowed to dry in the sun ere the roof was
put on and the interior fittings added. The walls
dried as hard as a brick, and were as durable. In
my recollection only one of the structures had bad
luck, a heavy thunderstorm washing the nearly-
finished, undried walls away. But the stuff was
gathered up, re-mixed, and the cottage completed.
* * * #
“Brumby”: “Winkers” (B. 23/9/’2O)
wants a remedy for greasy heels. This advice will
certainly offend the horse-quacks, but I’ve proved
its efficiency dozens of times. Wash the afflicted
parts thoroughly in very hot water, and don’t use
greasy soaps. Open up the sores and get rid of all
pus. Now make a paste of clean whiting and
plaster it all over the prad’s fetlock, and bind it
on with a clean cloth. The whiting absorbs all
foreign matter, and the bandage beats the flies.
Renew the treatment every 24 hours, and “Winkers’s”
nag will shift his sulky as usual inside a fortnight.
If this cheap and easily-obtained remedy is not
effective, use washing-blue instead of whiting. I’ve
never kno\vn either to fail when the treatment has
been persevered with. The main thing is to keep
the sores dry.
* * * *
“Mulga” : Mallee, box, belar and myall are
all good for domestic cooking, but forest-oak is the
joker and two bowers included. It gives an ideal
heat for a stove and makes very little ash or soot,
while no baker having once used it will hesitate to
pay more for it than any other firewood. For an
open or camp-fire gidya stands alone. It generates
a great heat, and burns slowly away to a beautiful
white ash, whether the vegetable be green or dry.
When caught unexpectedly by heavy rain, don’t worry
about being unable to start a fire if sandalwood is
nearby. Break off a few small dead twigs and apply
a match. A Noah’s deluge working overtime wouldn’t
keep it from burning.
* * * *
“Wondai” : Record of posts from one tree?
Two brothers, Devaney, on Canning Downs, near
Warwick (Q.), split 640 six-footers from an old man
ironbark. This was some 40 years ago. The brothers
are still living in the district where they put up
the record of their lives.
* * * *
Nalla Dooh”: New Guinea native cus-
toms differ widely, notably in the disposal of the
dead. Towards the border of the old German territory
the dead are exposed on platforms in the village till
they decompose. The bones are collected and stored.
Further north there is not much in-
dication that any trouble is taken
other than carrying the body to the
bush. On the Rei Coast a man’s body
is buried in the floor of the house he
occupied in life. The house is never
used again. In the Astrolabe Bay
hinterland a small thatch house is
built in the fork of a tree and the
body is seated therein, always facing
east. Further north again, in the
coastal district between the Ramu
and Sepek rivers, the head and hands
are preserved in a wooden bowl in
a relative’s house. Nearer Eitape the
departed is buried alongside his house.
Personal belongings are arranged at
the head. In New Ireland the walls
of most of the houses are stacks of
firewood. This is used to cremate its
owner when he dies. On New Han-
over, about 30 miles from New Ire-
land, the bodies of important natives
were cut up and pieces sent to neigh-
boring tribes. This was done as late
as 1918. In the Baining district of
New Britain the bones are cleaned,
then lashed in a mat and suspended
in the house of the next-of-kin. I
have seen in houses in the Hansa Bay
~„ district strings of lower jaws and
undies of the bones of the forearm hanging from
the rafters. I do not know whether these were the
souvenirs of a banquet or otherwise, as the residents
were en route for the horizon when I reached the
villages.
* * * #
“Sou’-West”: “Nor’-West” (B. 29/7/’2O)
mentions the remarkable preservation of a piece of
timber taken from a deep-lead tin-mine at Ruby
Hill, near Emmaville (N.S.W.). Twenty years ago
Robson Bros, were working a deep lead at Garliek’s,
near Trentham (Vic.). I paid them a visit in
January, 1901, and was shown a blackwood-tree
(barrel about Ift. diameter) which had been taken
from the wash-dirt at a depth of 86ft. under a basalt
layer similar to that of Ruby Hill. Except for the
leaves, the tree was practically intact, including
roots and bark. There was no sign of rot. The tim-
ber worked well, and took a beautiful polish. Unlike
“Nor’-West’s” piece it did not disintegrate on expos-
ure to the air ; anyway, it didn’t, for the nine years
I kept the pieces I carried off with me.
1VT.H.8.”: Some correspondents doubt
whether cannibalism was practised by Australian
blacks. It was really in existence as far south as
Twofold Bay in 1854. At that time a small cutter,
The Ebenezer, of London, sailed into Kiah River. The
captain, owner of the vessel, had a very good offer
of a station property on the Kiah, and had very

nearly closed, when it happened that a party of naked
natives came along the beach in full view of the
ship s crew, and one of the blacks was carrying on
his shoulder the whole leg of another blackfellow.
On inquiry it was ascertained that cannibalism was
quite common in that locality, and also that a white
child had been carried away by the natives. As the
skipper had a delicate wife and some children who
had just arrived from London, that station bargain
was not closed, and the captain missed the chance of
his life. Sixty-six years ago; but 1 remember the
incident quite well.
* * * *
“N’importe” : Here in Nor’-West Queens-
land I noticed recently a brown hawk evidently enjoy-
ing the evolution known to all flying men as the
falling leaf stunt— i.e., revolving on a vertical axis
while diving rapidly. Whether the bird has taken
its cue from human aviators I don’t know; but I
never noticed any bird perform the stunt before
the war.
* * * *
“Yarrum”: Notwithstanding the shooting
and driving, if it were not for ticks marsupials
would soon get the better of the man on the land.
I’ve seen tons of wallabies and kangaroos down with
them, and they rarely recover, although—unlike
humans—there is scarcely a part of theit anatomies
they can’t scratch. I once saw a native bear on
his back, and almost out —he was literally covered
with the parasites. I removed them, bathed the
punctured parts liberally with turpentine, and he
lived to climb another tree or two. The number
of snakes that succumb to ticks must also be con-
siderable, as they appear to have a partiality for
snake meat.
* * * *
“1241”: Speaking of the speed of some
of our abos., “615” (B. 9/9/’2O) enters- the kan-
garoo for the championship and timed him doing
38 miles per hour. But gather round, and listen.
Between Nyngan and Nevertire (N.S.W.) an emu
took the Bourke-to-Sydney mail-train on for half
a mile. Speed, 43 miles p.h. The emu was doing
it comfortably, and I was just about to invest 2d.
on him when a post-and-rail fence checked him.
* * * *
“J.G.” : Before “Spud” files away the worm
of his bit, as instructed by “Bright” (B. 2/9/’2O),
let him try keeping a tin of water handy to dip
the bit in every time he pulls it out from the po.d.
I have found water better than fat, as it cools the
bit quicker and keeps it cool longer; and .generally
it is heat that causes the tool to stick in the post,
which means that it gets screwed off in attempts
to release it. I lost dozens of bits in trying to
bore hard posts before I tried the water cure.
“Bright’s” idea is all right to save screwing off the
worm, but it doesn’t stop the bit from being screwed
off in the middle. Besides, a bit treated as “Bright”
advises takes about four times as long to go through
a post.
Te Tanhou”: I haven’t seen any of the

to 2ft. in length. After a tree had been felled for

hen they had burned into the surface, the big axes
oi adzes, rather—were used to plane away the
charred wood. The operation was repeated until
the required depth was obtained. No handle was
used. The Maori carpenter’s stone and bone imple-
ments included the axe or adze, the mallet, chisel,
saw, gouge and drill. I once picked up near Rotorua
a triangular boring-tool of black stone, shaped to
fit a handle, but neither Maori nor pakeha authori-
ties could give it a name.' Talking of boring-tools
brings up the uiero-katu, or louse-spear. It is a
long greenstone pendant, the bottom of which is
brought to a sharpish point. When mother is going
through the girl’s hair, a smart prod from this
hurries the located pest into the presence of his
Maker.
* * * *
202”: The only bottle-trees that contain
water in a free state are those that have become
split at the fork. The rain-water thus enters and
collects in the trunk ; but it soon* becomes so “high”

the “monkeys” to proceed, he took an axe from the
cart and cut a hole in a nearby bottle-tree, and the
water gushed out and saved the stock. “Yairs,” said
the other, “I came along there the following year
and found a lagoon 200 yards long and 50 yards
wide.”

SHAME!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ihe safe at the Russell-street Police Station was
burgled yesterday and about £4O stolen.”
The old chap laid his paper down and wiped away
a tear.
“It makes me fair ashamed,” he said, “to read what’s
printed here.”
He sighed and hid his ancient face inside a pot of
beer.
He sadly shook his pint at me—the beer spilled on
the mat.
“Why, durn it, any man,” said lie, “who’d do a
thing like that
Would steal a milkjug from a child, or rob a blind
man’s hat.
“Things, never were like this,” he said, “when 1
was in the game,
But now we old perfessionals must hang our headw
in shame.”
He slowly beckoned with his pot until the waiter
came.
“Ah, friend,” said I, “I understand your feelings
as you read
Of how our politicians grab to satisfy their greed,
And rob us of the cash that you and I so badly
need.”
“No, no!” he cried. “Perhaps they’re right their
wages to increase.
The public of its surplus cash I’ve often helped to
fleece,
But never have I stooped to rob the innocent police.”
“To think that such a thing could be!” He bowed
his head and wept;
The tears rolled down his furrowed cheeks, and in
his whiskers crept.
With absent mind he drank my beer, and in a
moment slept.

“Myall”: The dingo half-breed makes a
fair sheep-dog if trained, but is a demon to hunt.
I remember one owned by H. J. McConville, of Angi-
peena (S.A.), on the shepherding days. The shepherd
adopted the old method of attaching a piece of
stick about 2ft. long to the dog’s neck, suspended
in the middle, and long enough to hang just in
front of his shins. This prevented him from doing
any fast sprinting, but while going stead}' was little
encumbrance. Doggie stood the indignity for several
days, but at last, when a rabbit or a wallaby
was put up, could be seen carrying the stick in his
mouth and going for all he was worth. A recent
suggestion that a dingo will engage a half-grown
pup as nursegirl to her small fry is all bunkum.
I have seen pups of different sizes together, but
that was a result of two sluts having pups in the
same cave or burrow. Probably one mother would
suckle both litters if the other was absent. I have
seen “kangaroo” pups and little pigs sucking the
pig if the mother dog was away, and vice versa if
Mrs. Hog was out shopping.
* * * *
“Retlasoe”: Before the summer is fairly
on them, warn cockies and poultry-farmers, if they
find a gohanna in the fowl-pen, to hit him on the
head instead of in the middle of the back. Finding a
go. in the yard I happened to pat him on the bows
with a waddy, and, requiring some lubricating oil,
decided to then remove his tallow. That done, a
closer inspection revealed amidships a half-dozen
hen-eggs, intact. As eggs were worth 3s. a dozen, I
saved 18d. by that lucky hit for’ard.

“Karee” (B. 5/8/’2O) champions
the Arab horse, quoting a race he saw in Algiers.
They galloped 22 kilometres, (13J miles) in 44min.
llsec., which works out at a shade over a mile in
three minutes. Twenty . years ago, before the
S.P.C.A. took a hand, the Yanks had horses that
could trot 20 miles in an hour, and they didn’t time
them with a sundial either.
* * * *
“Jobber”: I have seen another kind of
laundry “iron” used by shearers. Theirs was an
ordinary “Diamantina jam” (golden syrup) tin, with
a handle on, and filled with boiling water. It
acted very well. I’ve known “barbers” go to no
end of trouble over their toilet prior to a week-end
at Lake Eliza—Lawson’s “lonely pub in the mulga
scrub”—and have even seen them get “mokkered in
their classy clobber” just to hang around the .shed
or hut on Sunday. What makes bush people “dress”
for Sunday? I’ve lived in parts where no one
would go, unless lost, and I always did it. Does
anyone know why?
* ■» » •
“Lignite”: Re “Werrimee’s” contention
that a snake cannot kill itself by a bite. I know
that scientists hold the same opinion. But the ex-
perience of bushmen is that venomous snakes will
die when they bite themselves with their fangs. I
saw an attempt to kill a black snake. It was struck
twice, and then the stick broke. It made off and a
carpet-snake was on the line of retreat. ’The black,
who by this time was probably not feeling affable,
bit him. The carpet crawled away a short distance
and in an hour was dead. I saw a man amuse him-
self by putting a scorpion inside a ring of hot
ashes. The scorpion went round the ring trying in
vain to find an exit; then he bent his tail over his
back, stung himself and in a few seconds was dead.
I saw a man removing timber accidentally knock the
tail off a fan-tailed lizard. The lizard in making its
escape ran against the detached tail, was stung and
in about a minute was dead. Venomous snakes are slow
to use their fangs if a milder form of defence will
suffice, and will only bite with their teeth. I saw a
man bitten on the finger by a tiger-snake. It was only
half a mile to a doctor, and we tried to persuade him to
go. He would not—said it was nothing, only a bite

from the teeth of the snake. The wound was bleeding
and he applied salt and vinegar and suffered no ill
effects. A youth on the Clarence, bitten by a black
snake, went at once to a doctor, who said there was no
snake poison about him, though the marks of the
teeth were visible. There were no ill effects after.
At Inverell two men were bitten each on the finger
by a death-adder. Both went post haste to a doctor,
who said there was no poison, and no ill effects were
afterwards felt.
‘‘Padjud” : Though years among greyhounds
has convinced me that there is no hard-and-fast rule
for picking the prospective champion from a litter,
there are points worth noting. Select the longest
puppy as they sprawl on the ground (don’t pica them
up). If, as they grow, this pup also becomes the
NO NAME FOR IT IN HIS DICTIONARY.
OVERSEER: “Well, Jacky, what did you call your son?”
JACKY : Don't know what to call that fella, boss. He bin howl like a dingo, scratch
like a cat, and get around like a snake.”
“boss” of the litter, there is a good chance that he
will be the speediest. The difficulty with all systems
is that the vitality of the animal cannot be measured.
Even perfect conformation and long galloping stride
are of no use if the nervous energy to “work it” is
lacking. This explains why many apparently perfect
racehorses and greyhounds fail to win. But the fight-
ing nature of the puppy is some evidence that the
grown dog will have the necessary fire to move his
works. There is absolutely nothing in “leaving it to
mother.” It is practically a cert, that she will
attend first to the puppy in greatest need of help—
i.e., the weakest. The weaklings that afterwards
become winners are about 0 per cent.
“Pick”: Gum-trees, no matter of what
species, develop grain according to the circumstances
under which they struggle through sapling-hood. In
free soil and under favorable conditions
their barrels will be clean and
straight, and they split easily “on
the quarter.” But in unfavorable
positions, or when early disease or
injury prevents rapid growth, the wood
becomes ringy. It is then hard to
wedge asunder, and will only shell
off in layers, or, as splitters say, “split
on the back.” Brother Binghi sought
this kind of tree for his battle-shields.
With his stone axe he chipped off the
bark and hacked out laboriously the
shape of his shield through the first
layer of the wood. Then he went on
a holiday until sun cracks began to
peel, off the slab. With much tapping
and alternate soaking and drying, the
shield was at length coaxed from the
trunk entire. It measured no more
than 3ft. by 2ft., but in the hands
of an expert it was only when several spears came
together that it failed as a weapon of defence.
“Kununoppin”: Can anybody suggest a
suitable explosive to deal with rabbit warrens in
fairly easily-worked clay soil, such as we have here
in this wheat belt of Westralia? I have tried
dynamite, but there is not enough resistance. Pro-
bably some Digger might suggest something in the
explosive line that would have the desired effect,
viz., to cave in the walls of the burrows and smother
the occupants. At least that is what I am aiming at.
“Huffin-Guffin”: Tel] Bill the barkstripper
to leave unstripped a low-branching limb on each
tree, with a connecting piece of bark to the ground.
Then there will be another tree to strip in a few
“Moncur Street”: “Te Whare” (R.
2/9/’2O) could have amplified his information re
sarsaparilla. Two points call for discussion:
(1) Its value; and (2) the likeness to —rather, con-
fusion with —Hardenbergia monophylla. (1) The uses
and modes of preparing the real sarsaparilla are
many, and everywhere in the bush can be seen
bundles of srnilax being dried, or bottles of the
decoction put to medicinal use. The writer has
tried several methods. His most successful is to
collect the leaves before the flowers are too ad-
vanced (or it matters not if the wiry plant has
black berries on it) ; dry the leaves to a whiteness;
boil leaves (and berries) till former are soft; strain
and let cool and bottle. If sufficient leaves are
used, the cold extract is very sweet and tempting.
I don’t see why it shouldn’t be used thus quite as
much as foreign “sarsaparilla tea.” (2) Botanically
the false sars. is one of the pea tribe, grows chiefly
on barren soil, climbs up any dry stick, flowers
very early, and is a beautiful sight on the coast-
line or the nearest hills from July on. The leaves
of the true and the false are quite different. The
leaf of the true has three lines conspicuous enough
on the side which may be called the front. The
leaves of the wrong sars. have edges turned often
inwards, and the leaf is long and thin. The veins
are not so defined and are irregular. Taste both.
Srnilax is sweet and its supporting stem is very wiry.
“Sandfly” : As a member of the Far North-
ern Fur Trading and Dog Scalping Society, I consider
it would be an injustice to the craft and all members
concerned to allow “W. Blister” (B. 5/8/’2O) to put
that joke up on us about Billy Doubtfire shooting,
pegging out, etc., 350 ’roos in one week without a
kick. Billy Doubtfire may be a “gun” at the game,
but allowing for that there’s a dozen bags of dingo
scalps and a few bales of kang. skins behind our
society to back the performance against him, allowing
100 off the total, to make things a little easier for
him. ’Roo shooting is the hardest work in Australia
bar floating loans, and if a scalper averages 90 a
week he is doing well, and working 16 hours out of
the 24. To show’ how impossible Doubtfire’s 350
is I will outline the work and time required to do
the job. He would have to average 50 a day, seven
days a week. For this number he would want 100
cartridges per day (two shots per ’roo is good going).
That would mean two hour's to cast bullets and load.
The loading is usually done last thing at night, but
for argument sake, say he rises at 4 a.m. and loads
up. Six o’clock the billy is on and he is away after
the horses (they don’t usually snore near the camp
all night). The saddle-horse is ready and breakfast
over at 7—three hours gone. A short ride to the
scene of action, and even if the ’roos are as thick
as Germans on the firing-line a few shots will scatter
them and necessitate following up. He must run down
one here and there which has not been badly wounded
and looks like getting away. Cleaning the rifle and
•filling the magazine occasionally takes up more time.
When the 50 have been shot seven hours have passed
since the first one dropped. Now into the skinning ;
eig t an hour is good going if there are a few “old men”
01 laige bucks amongst them with hides welded to
the meat and as tough to peel as the seat of a
native-bear’s strides. The last 10 or 20 are not
going to be undressed as quickly as the first; besides,
tieie is some distance to walk or ride between each
carcase, so seven hours for the skinning would be a fair
allowance. The skins have now to be taken to camp,
and as neddy refuses to carry 50 in one up, two trips
have to be made—another hour gone. The skins at
the camp, they have to be washed free of blood and
hung up to drain—another hour. While the skins are
draining the 50 that were pegged out the day before
must have the nails pulled out and put together, and
the skins must be put away—two more hours. Now
for the pegging out; 10 an hour is solid work,
pegging properly with about 60 nails each—five hours.
Eveiy skin has now to be painted with an arsenical
wash and a fresh kerosene-tin full put on to
boil for the next lot—another hour. The skinning
knife wants a touch up on the oilstone, the old rifle
wants a drop of oil, a damper to cook, corned beef
ditto, and, blime! there’s 28 hours gone without
dinner or supper, and breakfast-time passed two
hours ago! Yes, all the scalps, talons, skins, furs,
etc., from Cape \ork to Billy Hughes’s electorate
against Billy Doubtfire and his 350!
* * * #
“F.J.”: Can any Abo. tell me how to keep
a horse from rearing, or cure him of it? I have
had a black saddle hack for about three years, and
although he has often bolted he had never tried
rearing until the other day when, seemingly for no
reason at all, he began having a few goes at it,
ending up by losing his balance and falling back-
wards on me. It was my lucky day and I came off
with only a few bruises; but I don’t want to make
a hobby of it.
* * * •
“Isaac Wegg”: “Bung” (B. 2/9/’2O) is
wrong in saying the male lory-parrot changes from
green to red. The male lory is red from the begin-
ning. Evidently “Bung” means the male king, who
changes in the third year to scarlet.
* * * *
“Maskee”; “Bill R.’s” assertion (B.
9/9/ 20) that he has seen one plug of dynamite
account for “thousands” of salmon will get the cold
eye from anyone experienced in “shooting” fish. Even
with the thick schools found in the waters of (late)
German New Guinea, I’ve never seen more than a
couple of hundred fish of the size of salmon knocked
over with one “shot.” It would be impossible to
get more than that number in the limited area
affected by the explosion. As for some of the salmon
being “hurled for yards across the dry beach sand”
—well, “Bill R.’s” dynamite must have been
different. A miniature water-spout, immediately
above the point of explosion, and governed in size bv
the depth at which the charge explodes, is the onlv
geyser effect I’ve ever noted. “Bill R.’s” query as
to “what is the effect that submarine explosions have
on fish” is simply answered. Within a certain radius
(that, too, depends upon the depth) it kills them ;
presumably through the sudden and violent expulsion
of air from their bodies by the concussion, which seems
always to concentrate on one point in the fish. The
fact that dynamited fish invariably sustain a bruise on
the body immediately above the vital organs supports
that theory.
* * * #
“Coringa”: “Hemp” (B. 26/8/’2O) wants
someone to invent a humane bunny trap. One pur-
porting to be such was brought out years ago. It
was a wire-cage contrivance, to be placed at the
mouth of the burrow, and was large enough to
accommodate three or four. Although it did away
with broken legs, it was a worse horror; for when
the burrow was in rocky places, where bunny couldn’t
scrape a way out, he’d die of starvation rather than
face the cage. Some bunnies were caught at times,
but those unfortunates never reached the freezing
works or the wil’ rabbito; they were only skin and
bone.

the Motor Car
has many missions
Have you ever paused a moment in a busy shopping
thoroughfare, and watched the motor cars threading their
way through the stream of traffic? The mastery of man
over mechanics was never better illustrated. The
obedience of a car to every movement of the hands on the
wheel, the feet on the pedals, makes it a thing alive. The
thousands of parts are doing their work, and doing it
effectively. The modem car is well-nigh foolproof. Give
it reasonable treatment and care and it responds with
service that is astounding when one figures out the im-
mensity of work the average car really does. Its duties
are almost as numerous as its component parts. In Cities,
thousands of them glide about-all units of dependable
service-aiding social and business intercourse In the
Country the car is a God-send, making life more attractive,
more profitable, and more appreciated. It’s a tireless ser-
vant calling only for fuel, oil, water, and strong sturdy
tyres that will stand up to hard work without trouble.
Obviously a car is only as serviceable as its tyres. It is in
this connection that it is well to remember that for all-
round satisfaction Australian-made
□
stand alone. Highest quality, scientific construction, and
plenty of rubber and fabric to withstand continual hard
driving for thousands of miles, accounts for their great
service and popularity. Furthermore their running cost is
less than any imported tyres-an important factor in keep-
ing down the cost of your motoring. All garages can sup-
ply in “ Railroad” and “Grooved.” Use them. It pays 1

a celebrity as a writer about that game anti'
of amiable biographies, just in the style that,
delights the middle-aged frequenter of the;,
circulating library. His publisher is Fisher*
Unwin, who has done very well these forty
years, is married to a daughter of Richard
Cobden, the Freetrader, and publishes the
dreary literature of that cult, including the>
drearier-still lives of the manufacturers wlioi
made their millions by it.
Naturally, then, the first person dealt with
by our historian was W. E. Gladstone, who
even in the first of “the ’Eighties” was un-
fitted for the post of Prime Minister of Eng-
land. He was too old. The people who.
think—the always-small minority which
really governs the People’s Parliament—saw
that Gladstone’s sudden volte face to Ireland
was simply a crumbling in his leadership.
They “saw red” when they heard (the inci-
dent is recorded by Mr. Hutchinson quite
soberly) that “he told one of his followers,.
‘Yes, 1 believe that God has designed that I
shall be the saviour of Ireland,’ raising his
eyes to Heaven with almost a rapt look in
them.” It is never mentioned in Mr.
Hutchinson’s book that Gladstone entered
politics as a Tory, just as Disraeli entered
them as a Radical. By his bitter phrase, “an
old man in a. hurry,” Lord Randolph
Churchill startled the House of Commons,
and made the English love him. It was.
mainly the fear of what might happen while
Gladstone lived that enabled Salisbury, the
antithesis in every way of the G.0.M.. to
govern England for so long. And all of
criticism that Mr. Hutchinson offers is-: “I
do not think that Mr. Gladstone possessed a.
scintilla of humor!”
The second place amongst these portraits
is given to the man who is best known as.
Loi*d Hartington, forty years ago calling him-
self a Liberal. Yet lie always spoke, voted
and acted as a Conservative, and never did
anything fresh except marry a lady who was:
thus enabled to be twice a duchess. The
third portrait is of Charles Stewart Parnell.
Of that man two statements are enough. “In
time he sickened and died, a finished man....
That Parnell was a good man, few will
claim; that he had elements of greatness,
very few, I think, can doubt.” This is the
sort of writing worthy of what passes in
English club-land as a “most remarkable
man.” ' .
The patient reader of lialf-a-century hence
will wonder what could have induced any
person to hav& thrown down on paper such
rubbish about the public men of the days of
his youth. Yet my memory recalls with
perfect clearness the time when half the
papers and rather more than half the talkers
burbled this sort of stuff without restraint.
Does the history of the days of Waterloo so
grossly misrepresent the sayings and doings
ot that time? Will the year 1960 allow
elderly men to babble of the Great War and
those who figured therein ? Half the men at
least in Mr. Hutchinson’s gallery were more
or less known to me; I have dined with
them, been consulted by them, talked with

H. H. CHAMPION.
Milton, Shakspeare, etc.
Tilting at Newbolt, “D.M.W.” (R.P.
'9/9/’2O) makes the astonishing statement
that .Milton’s “Paradise Lost” is a boys’
■book ; but perhaps the statement is offered
tor the mere purpose of astonishing. Again,
he says, Milton “is very living to me, more
so in many ways than Shakspeare and the
rest. ’ This stowing away of poor old Shak-
speare and the rest” in a third-class car-
riage, and allotting to John Milton a speci-
ally-upholstered car to himself, is significant

marcation between Shakspeare and the
.smaller great men, how may he expect to
be taken seriously' in his other division which
would, if it could, isolate Milton at the
expense of Shakspeare? Further, this critic
■explains : “I find Milton’s work a curious
test of literary honesty. Those to whom he
is vital are generally vital in their own
work. This declaration combined with his
earlier one, “he is very living to me,” arro-
gates to himself a bunch of exceedingly wild
flowers, while the adherents of Shakspeare
•are sent empty away.
Leaving out Shakspeare, “the rest” are
as much entitled to deride
D.M.W. s assertion of Shakspeare’s inferi-
ority to Milton. Milton, whose greatness
nobody will dispute, has something to lose
:m a comparison, with Shakspeare (Milton
fades under Shakspeare like a great altaf-
candle disappearing before the flame whence
it derives its light), and he is far too meta-
physical in “Paradise Lost” to reach the
heart > of any. boy, excluding, of course,
‘D.M.W.” His inspiration is most apparent in
those pages which he has devoted to Adam’s
adventure with Eve, and they must be eter-
nally remembered; but thereafter the poem
freezes into theology and becomes little more
than the Scripture dressed up in verse
Paradise Lost” cannot fairly be called crea-
tive, and is altogether too full of darkness
and groaning to meet the needs of a healthy
boy’s appetite. The real reason for Milton
not having achieved the topmost heights
may be that he wrote from under the pent-
house shadow of a too-austere religion:
indeed, lie was so much aware of this him-
self that he did not hesitate to appropriate
the golden Olympus of ancient Homeric
times, and peopling it with Christian
angels, did what he could.
If the _ truth must be told, Milton had
closed his heart long before God had
closed his eyes. He might cause a fanatic
to wail for his sins, or a fanatic to leap
for the Defeat of the Devil; but he fails
singularly of making a boy smile for happi-
ness or cry for tenderness of anything he
has written in “Paradise Lost.” On the
other hand, boys love Shakspeare, and rightly
so, for in him they find the whole gamut of
emotions. Shakspeare is creative; Milton
makes his epic out of the Bible and has little
original philosophy. Indubitably he grows
tedious and cold. Shakspeare allows his
muse far greater latitude than Milton, and
his audacious freedom is difficult to surpass;
simple and honest and direct, his poetry is
founded on natural emotions, and neither
time’s progress nor a change of manners can
much alfect poetry which has nature for its
basis.
Turning from “Paradise Lost” Milton’s
sonnets leap through the heart like fire:—
Cromwell, our chief of men, who through a cloud,
Not of war only, but detractions rude,
Guided by faith and matchless fortitude,
To peace and truth thy glorious way hast plough’d
And on the neck of crowntd fortune proud
Hast rear’d God’s trophies and his work pursued,
While Darwen-stream with blood of Scots imbrued,
And Dunbar-field resounds thy praises loud,
And Worcester’s laureat wreath. Yet much. remains
To conquer still; peace hath her victories
No less renown’d than war: new foes arise
Threatening to bind our souls with secular chains;
Help us to save free conscience from the paw
Of hireling wolves, whose gospel is their maw.
HUGH McCRAE.
The “Oxford A”
Spending some years long ago as a child
in the Midlands of England, I was taught
the local jealousy of the metropolis of that
district. Birmingham, according to its keen
rivals eight or ten miles away, had a ridi-
culously affected way of speaking. It said,
as illustrated in a jingle much repeated and
much relished, “My mahster’s a brahss
cahster.” And the point of the story is that,
in the satire, those words were pronounced
exactly as they are to-day pronounced by
everybody. From which it follows that the
district (including myself, of course) ordi-
narily pronounced them with the a as flat
as it is in “cat” or “bank.” One would
stoutly deny it now, probably, but for the
evidence of that jingle.
There is much virtue in a quotation which
can hold a word for- future inspection, like
the fly in amber or, (he fossilised fish in rock.
To find, in a hymn of Charles Wesley, the
brisk fine “Blast the blooming works of
grace,” throws more light on the changes
in the meaning of words than a whole essay.
And we never quite realise that Queen Anne
called tea ‘ tay” till we find Pope using it as
the obvious rhyme for “obey.” The old
poets obstinately made “wind,” the wind that
blows, rhyme with “find” ; but John David-
son pins it down in its proper place with
sinnpd.” “ ’Twas in Tra/afgar’s bay,” the
ballad taught English people to say; but
Browning switched them back on the right
line when he made it rhyme with “far.” (The
famous isthmus has within one’s recollection
gone through precisely similar stages; it
used to be called Panahma, and is now
I anna mail.) And Alfred Austin might have
gone on for ever pronouncing “Rand” to
rhyme with “scanned”; but when he put
that in a. verse all South Africa rose up to
correct him.
Somewhere around 1880 came in what
" , en called the Oxford a, and every-
body began to say “brahss” and “mahster.”
Everybody, that is, except the Americans,
who still find the English "cahn’t” and
nahsty amusing. And why “cannot”
should have a different a sound when the o
is dropped nobody can say.
The mystery, indeed, about .this broad a
is in both its. widespread and comparatively
sudden adoption and the smallness of its
range. A few constantly-used words in “ass,”
ast, "ath” have it, but the vast majority
or words, apparently similar, know nothing
ot it. The banker still handles the fat man’s
cash, the blaek-and-tan is spanked for having
scraps on the mat with the cat, the damsels
in glad rags can unpack the hamper on the
sands, and the handsome dandy with bad
manners still flatters Madam. “Bat” is
short and “bath” long. “Mass” and “pass,”
“matter’’ and “master,” “anchor” and
“answer”—there seems to be no consistency
in them at all.
One might speculate that the broad a
comes from France rather than from Oxford,
and that the short one is reserved for words
of Saxon origin. But that won’t work.
"Mass” and “bank,” “madam” and “rapid”
are good French words, and one says
“grahnd” only when trying to imitate the
supposed Scotchman—who may originally
have learned to pronounce it that way from
his Queen Mary, who had in her time been
also Queen o.f France. On the other hand,
“fast” and “bath” are not French at all.
The imported “alto” and “piano” are
optional at most.
Why these things are so nobody seems to
know; nor does anybody greatly care. Pro-
nunciation, in fact, is nobody's business.
Learned men will write whole essays on a
trifling change in spelling, as to whether,
for instance, “Labor” should have its Nor-
man-French u left in it or not; but pronun-
ciation alters from age to age without any
record being kept, .except accidental one's
such as have been "mentioned above. And
this in spite of the fact that all writing is
but a pale attempt to indicate the spoken
word. These things are a mystery.

A Satchel of Books
The Secret of Poetry, by M. R. Walker
(G. Hassell and Son, Adelaide). A paper
republished from the Adelaide University
Magazine, in which the author attempts to
get at the heart of the magic of song. There
is at least a suggestion of the direction in
which thought must travel towards an ex-
planation ; and that seems about as far as it
is possible to go.
The Great Leviathan, by D. A. Barker
(John Lane). The Great Leviathan is
society ; but Tom, the hero of the book, is
about a lot of things which have
little to do with that large beast. The book
has no plot, and its most important theipe—
the failure of the couple who avoid marriage
because of the man’s hatred of the legal tie
is made subordinate to less interesting
things. Fairly readable, but it leaves few
definite impressions.


The Studebaker
“Special Six”
THE country car-owner, needing as he does great
strength, speed and endurance in his car, naturally
demands these attributes. In the Studebaker
Special Six” he gets them all—emphasised.
But he gets more than is immediately necessary. He
gets a margin over and above the ordinary requirements
a margin that meets the emergency and adds to the
economy and life of the car.
The Special Six is a car of 119-mch wheelbase, with
29-horsepower Studehaker-designed and Studebaker-built
demountable-head motor; improved carburetter, with ‘‘hot-
spot” intake manifold; artistic, torpedo-shape cowl lights at
corners of windshield; outside and inside door handles, and
tonneau light with extension cord.
Aero-type Dixie high-tension magneto, a particularly
effective and improved speedometer and 32 x 4 inch Good-
year Cord Tyres throughout are further excellent features.
The beauty of the design of the “Special Six” needs only to
be seen to win instant admiration. The ample roominess
and the richness of the Genuine French Plaited Leather
Upholstery make it a car of luxurious comfort.
The Studebaker “Special Six” is built with a keen
regard for Australian conditions. The frame has
been developed by years of experience and study.
It is strong enough to meet all requirements.
The powerful, responsive engine is wonderfully
economical of petrol.

“Mulga” : To the black wattle mentioned
by “J.G.” (B, 2/9/’2O) for making axe-
handles, add the leopard-wood of Western
Queensland. I knew a bridge carpenter em
ployed on the railway between Itoma and
Cunnamulla who made his axe, adze and
hammer handles of this vegetable. He
claimed them to be better than the imported
article, and one axe-handle that he gave me
lasted two years at scrub falling. Un-
fortunately the timber is not very plentiful,
otherwise a fortune would be waiting for some
enterprising individual. Personally, 1 con-
sider the reason why Australian axe-handles
made from spotted-gum and ironbark do not
last is carelessness in the picking of the
timber.
* * * *
“Country Ped” : If the jam factories dis-
cover a great shortage of apricots and peaches
this season—as there is likely to be—they
will have only themselves to blame. All along
the Murray fruitgrowers are grubbing out
peach and apricot trees, and planting sultanas
and currants. One grower showed me three
acres of fine peach trees which he was re-
luctantly destroying. “Look at them!” he
said. “Five years old, and all I got out of
them last year, after paying freight and
pickers and buying cases, was £10!” He
expects to be getting £65 a ton for sultanas
in three years, and an acre easily yields more
than a ton. Yet the consumer is paying Is.
sd. for a l-ilb. tin of jam, and at the rate of
£BO a ton for canned peaches.
“H.A.” : I hand the Importing Profiteers’
Grand Challenge Cup to a firm which handles
a well-known American breakfast food com-
posed of flaked maize, or else to their princi-
pals across the water. My grocer charges
me 2s. Id. per carton for it. On looking it
over the other day I discovered the legend
“Contents eight ounces,” which means that
I am paying at the rate of £ll 13s. 4d. per
bushel (of course, including cooking, pack-
ing, freight, etc.) for maize which I am at
present selling at Bs. per bushel. I suppose
I am the mug for buying it; but I like it,
and I can’t buy a corresponding Australian
article. Perhaps the Melbourne co. which
now takes so much of our Queensland maize
may reach out for a bit of this business. If
it can produce the goods (which should not
be difficult), it will do a good turn for the
Australian cocky, too.
“O.K.”< When will the fish trade cease to
be the means of attracting a streamlet of
Dagoes to these shores: One may walk
unsuspiciously into the fishshop 'of the
National Deep Sea Products Association or
some such thing, and find himself in a nest
of swarthy birds who chatter in a foreign
tongue. If the customer stays to buy some
smoked fish (at three times its pre-war price)
the only English words he hears are shouted
by the salesman to a colleague at the cash-
register. Otherwise the language is foreign
and doubtless expressive .of Dago contempt
for damfool- Australians who haven’t enough
horse-sense to run their own fish-shops.
Granted that the forbidding aliens pay more
attention to the set-out of the goods than
an average Australian in the fish or fruit
line of business, the case for the defence ends
at that. The Dago is ungenial and almost
openly insolent, as a rule. He’s rapacious,
tricky and anti-Australian. As a foreigner
he “cottons” to foreigners in general, and
always deals with an alien rather than an
Australian. The Dago trading-ring is a
sufficiently pernicious influence as it is. It
promises to be a _ very strong influence
townrds anti-nationaltsm if no powerful
opposition is organised on the Australian
ticket.

“Honest Burglar” : Old explorer Edmunds,
whose fascinating diary recently went to

tain Edmunds’s guests. One of the items
on the programme submitted for approval

“Blacklip”: That Japs have a monopoly

The Queensland Fair Rents Act has some
weird results. A working couple, anxious
to get rid of the landlord for ever, scraped
up the money to buy a cottage and paid
the price. The tenant, fearing an ejection,
lodged a claim for reduction of rent by Is.
week. The Court gave him tenancy for a
further six months. So the couple who had
bought the place for a home have had to
put up in a lodging-house. Every tenant
who has a suspicion of getting notice to
quit now rushes into the Court that he may
get six months’ grace—and generally pulls
it off, no matter how bad a tenant he may
be. Meantime, while there is a clamor for
more houses, the unemployed in Brisbane sit
daily on the doormat of Jack Fihelly.
“A.. 1.8.” : Dad had a bush contract which
he sublet to a party of Maoris. Ilenare had
a habit of coming down two or three times a
week to collect what he thought should be
coming to him. The hardest, case of the lot
was Kaka, an old chap who had the job of
shifting the logs into the creek. The boss got
exasperated and swore that Kaka wouldn’t
get another stick of tobacco until all the
timber was afloat. Next day Kaka called
as usual. “Clear out!” roared the boss.
“Didn’t I tell you not to come back till the
job was finished?” “By cripes, I finish all
eight. got him all in the creek,” said
Kaka. “Ivapai you give the money now.”
The boss adjourned and brought out a piece
of photo paper, and told Kaka to hold it.
“Now, Kaka. if the job not finished and you
tell the lie this paper turn black,” said the
boss. An astonished Henare watched the
paper darken. The evidence of guilt
was overwhelming. “By cripes. boss, I been
make the mistake all right.” said Kaka, turn-
ing green. Next week the logs were on their
way to the mill, and a regenerated Kaka sent
an emissary to collect the dividend and re-
turn to the boss a couple of axes which had
disappeared off the job some time before.-
“124”: Grim commentary upon Austra-
lia’s literary sense is the success achieved
by alleged authors and poets in turning
into commercial successes their weird wares.
In my own provincial town in one week I
have encountered three publications, all
gaining steady if not ready sale, and all at
rates which must pay their perpetrators
handsomely. One is an old friend, the
lucubrations of an alleged Scotch Jew —a
slim volume of piffling inanities, strained
humor and pointless philosophising. The
author-vendor gets 6s. for this. He has
been on the game for at least three years,
and looks fat. I met him first in the early
stages of the exploit: he was then taking
orders for the as yet unwritten book —and
getting them by the hundred, with stacks of
recommendations and publicity to boot; yet
no publisher on earth would have looked at
the thing on its merits. Volume 11. of my
collection was also being hawked by its
author-several thousand lines of common-
place jingle, bound in brown and gold:
“Life’s Spasms” or something it was called,
first issued in connection with the Inaugu-
ration of the Commonwealth or Black Wed-
nesday of something, but augmented and
brought up to date. The booklet was going
wejl: its aesthetic cover was to be seen peep-
ing from the debris of every householder’s
dustbin. Vol. 111, a four-page monograph
in really outrageous doggerel (The Bulle-
tin reviewed it scathingly a few weeks ago),
was in its second thousand, and was being
bought by semi-public institutions and
amelioration societies (which of course will
do anything!) for distribution among the
poor and helpless. In this case, again, the
author was the booklet’s distributing-agent,
as he had been its advance and publicity
agent. With these examples before me I
am convinced that all this high-falutin’ about
style, application, imagination, soul, Par-
nassus, and infinite capacity for taking pains
is rubbish: to succeed in “literature” what
are really needed are some aptitude for sales-
manship, a deficiency of humor and a tqugh

David and Goliath!
T' HE David of Industry is the Oxy-Acetylene Process, and
1 Goliath finds his industrial counterpart in the great
pieces of machinery which break down or need to be
broken up.
Wherever machinery is in continuous operation, some breakage or wearing of parts
is a natural result at some time or other. One remedy is to dismantle the broken
part and obtain a new one; holding up the plant, to the confusion of production
and employees. The modern method is to call in the Oxy-Acetylene Welder,
or, better still, have your own Oxy-Acetylene Welding Outfit on the spot.
The most complicated smash in any metr.l part, of any size, has no terrors for
the Oxy-Acetylene Welding Blowpipe. Its prompt use in time of trouble saves
expense; more than enough to pay for its cost over and over again. It fuses
broken, parts composed of cast or wr ought iron, mild steel, brass, copper,
aluminium and gunmetal, into one homogeneous whole.
broken P a^ s of any machinery, don’t buy new castings, don’t hold up the plant?
Send foi the nearest Oxy-Acetylene at once. They are to be found everywhere through-
\ ust n alia ’ always ? eady * or repair jobs or any metal cutting, and you will find them
gieat fellows tor saving money. Ask us for illustrated booklet, which shows many of
the savings possible by the use of Oxy-Acetylene Process.

This illustration is typical of the amazing way in
which the Oxy-Acetylene Welder saves money for
machinery users. A flaw in the body of a gigantic
hammer, and the owners are faced with a problem
which under ordinary circumstances means practi-
cally replacing the whole machine, and workers
have to stand idle in the meantime. The small,
insignificant Welding Blowpipe enables the break
to be filled in—a perfect fusion of the broken parts
—which makes the hammer as strong as new, for
a trifle compared with the enormous cost of new
castings.
What Makes Beaver Board*
ing So Simple and Easy
ONLY three steps, nailing, painting
and paneling, are what makes it
so easy to build walls and ceilings of
Beaver Board.
And Beaver Boarding is quick work.
The big panels cover large spaces, and
as soon as they are nailed in place
they can be painted. The fixing of the
decorative strips completes the job
and the room is ready for instant use.
In new buildings, the Beaver Board is
fixed direct to the studdings and joists.
In old ones it is nailed over the present
walls and ceilings, whether they are
lath and plaster, wood paneling, brick
or concrete. Not only is Beaver Board
easy to apply, but its result is always
pleasing and permanent.
Painting Beaver Board
wm
Paneling Beaver Board
Beaver Board is in reality, re-constructed timber,
built from the fibres of Canadian spruce into
large knotless, flawless panels that will not crack,
chip or fall. Beaver Board walls, and ceilings
will last as long as the building itself.
Beaver Board is stocked by Timber Merchants
and Builders’ Furnishers. See your local dealer!

“My little boy suffered with eczema
for over twelve months. It appeared

came in blotches all over his

night and it caused dis-

It doesn’t often happen; but a colored
sister on the Orara (N.S.W.) had triplets
the other day.
The groan of the Scone (X.S.M.) Anvo- !
cate in the dull season: —
Quite a chapter of other accidents which might
have proved fatal, occurred lately, but unfortunately .
without serious results.
The work of removing the bones from the
Jewish quarter of Melbourne General Ceme-
tery is delayed because the Council considers
all the tenders too high. Here is a hint of
possible Resurrection Day troubles —the
high cost of living may be a serious diffi-
culty in the way of raising the dead.
The new Housewives’ Association may do
a lot of good among the more affluent classes
as a teacher of domestic economy if it has
a turn that way. Australians are proved by
statistics to be great meat consumers, but
whether it is the meat that is eaten or what
goes into the ash-barrel that makes it great
is uncertain. If some Commission could
ascertain the weight for a year of tiie
aggregate ash-barrel of, say, Paris and com-
pare it with that of Sydney the information
might be of value.
Of Gerald Quealy, sometime of Bendigo
Independent, it is related that, weary of
receiving censorious notes from a dissatisfied
chief, he returned the last of the series with
the impish addendum “This correspondence
must now cease.” Apropos, “Dryblower”
Murphy, of Perth, once contributed . a
sparkling column to a Kalgoorlie paper, the
proprietor of which, a Scotchman, was hard
to please. He had a habit of adorning
Murphy’s “revises,” which were posted to
the author in Perth, with critical marginalia.
Against one particular jeu d’esprit he wrote:
“When do we begin to laugh?” He got his
answer by return mail. It read : “When the
necessary surgical operation has been
, performed.”
“Stargazer”: The wife of a tenor with
a recent grand opera co. was a source of
great anxiety to the management. She was
a small, unimportant voice herself, and her
behavior led to the management refusing
her the liberty of the theatre; but she often
succeeded in getting into the wings, armed
with an umbrella, with which she could smite
or prod her unhappy husband. On these occa-
sions the anxiety of the tenor in full view
of the audience to avoid some fearful thing
not visible to the general spectator lent a
peculiar quality to his acting. He would be
in the middle of pouring fervent music into
the ear of the gorgeous soprano, and, suddenly
discovering that he was within prodding
distance of the enemy, would jig across stage
in a way that led many people to imagine
that his was a comedy part. Ferocious
jealousy was the lady’s trouble, and she had
always to be held down when Faust got
fresh with Marguerita.
“Dido”: A drygoods firm in Melbourne
engaged Ernest Billiardcue, and found him a
nice young fellow and a perfect gentleman
up to the point at which certain doubts
arose in connection with some £l5O worth
of goods docketed “missing.” Ernest was
given seven days in which to explain. On
the third day Ernest’s poor old widowed
mother arrived in the front office, and
refused to be comforted. She cried over
the manager, she cried over two directors,
she wept into the office ink, she salted the
stock with her tears, and ever the burden
of her lay was the goodness of her boy to
his venerated parent. She wanted the firm
to accept a settlement in lieu of prosecut-
ing, in consideration of Ernest having gone
to Sunday-school regularly when he was a
boy, and of his habit of always kissing his
poor old mother good-night. For three days
Ernest’s mother cried, and then the manage-
ment consented not to prosecute Ernest in
consideration of his making the deficit
good. After that began the task of collect-
ing the first instalment. It was a failure.
The official entrusted with the job had to
explain. “Well, gentlemen,” said he, “the
fact is Billiardcue hasn’t a bean. It took
every penny he had, as I gather, to pay some
old woman to come here and be his broken-
hearted mother.”
“Taffrail”: The sailing-ship isn’t half as
dead as it once looked. The war didn’t help
the building of windjammers much, for the
demand was for vessels that could dodge the
submarine; but up to 1914 the Yankee was
turning out very slick seven-masted craft
and was proud of them. Something still
bigger (700 ft. long) was in view, but was
postponed by reason of Huns. This ark
would require 150 men where a steam behe-
moth of the same size would carry 1000.
The average pace is certainly less than that,
of a steamer, but not so much less than that
of a steamer periodically held up by coal
strikes and other troubles, which are grow-
ing more numerous. There are two less
unions to argue with on a sailing-ship than
on a steamer —the stokers, who are a diffi-
cult lot, and the engineers—and there is one
less ashore —the coal lumpers. The soaring
prices of fuel begin to make owners review
the situation, for the price of wind is almost
the only thing that hasn’t risen. It is as
cheap as in Jonah’s time. Now that the
strain on the irreplaceable coal and oil supply
grows so tremendous and the giving out of
the latter seems possible and the cost soars
daily, the sight of so much good wind going
to waste becomes a misery. Further, sailing-
vessels can be made much safer than in the
days of crude charts and no wireless. A
hundred thousand pounds’ worth of good, up-
to-date canvas ship will move a million
pounds’ worth of cargo in less time and at
far less cost than a similar value of steam-
ship could do it, for there is a lot of canvas
ship for the money, and it doesn’t spend its
life dragging half its weight in iron and
fuel there and back. Its drawback is lack
of reliable haste, though its occasional haste
is all right, and it may be that on considera-
tion the hectic millionaire may find he isn't
in such a hurry as he thought.

Switch on the Light
and the Power, too!
THAT is the great feature which attracts
the country dweller to WESTERN
ELECTRIC POWER and LIGHT.
It means that you can go into any room, press
a button, and brilliant Electric Light is instan-
taneous. How different to Kerosene Lamps —
no matches, no smoke, no smell, no cleaning to do every
day. Inside and outside, you can have quick, conveni-
ent light wherever and whenever you want it.
But Power, as well as light, flows from the Western
Electric plant at the snap of a switch—that’s why farmers
like it! All around the house, wherever there is a Lamp
socket, you can operate those wonderful Western Elec-
tric labour-saving appliances which make a country heme
like the most up-to-date house in the City.
Out in the Barn, Milking shed or Dairy, a Western
Electric Utility Motor connected to a lamp socket will
do any job that is now done by hand. Or you can con-
nect many of the farm machines direct to the Pulley of
the Western Electric 3V4 HP. engine, the same as you
would to any engine. That is what the Pulley is there
for. Consider carefully the Western Electric Power
and Light outfit, and you will select it for two impor-
tant reasons. First , the Battery is big and strong with
a capacity of 180 Ampere hours. That is why there is
so much electric current for all needs.
Second, You are free from battery trouble. The plates
are extra thick and the construction is such that dan-
ger of buckling plates has been eliminated. The West-
ern Electric battery is given a tapering charge which
is the only sure protection for any battery.
Don’t buy a plant that only gives Electric Light. There
is no finer investment for the farm than Western El-
ectric Power and Light. Write to nearest agent for
Twenty Page Book and all particulars (post free).

How I Save
In spite of higher prices, lam saving money every day! So can you.
You see, I have given up cooking with dairy milk and only use Nestle’s
Condensed Milk. At first I thought it might be more expensive but now I realise
that besides being able to cook much tastier cakes, puddings and blanc manges, I
save dairy milk and sugar and use much less butter and fewer eggs.
Cooking with Nestle’s Condensed Milk means results that never vary and
a steady saving every week. You can prove it for yourself.

TO THE MEMBERS OF THE BROKEN HILL PROPRIETARY COMPANY LIMITED.
Equitable Building, 320 Collins Street, Melbourne, 22nd September, 1920.
Your Directors have been most carefully considering the iron and steel position in Australia, and
the many developments that are taking place in the establishment of new industries in Australia
based and depending upon adequate supplies of iron and steel. They are now convinced that t
interests of the Company require that the Company should be able fully and quickly to satisfy the
needs represented by the wants of Australia in this direction.
This necessitates large and extensive additions to the present plant at Newcastle Steel Works,
and as a consequence, it has been necessary for the Directors to formulate a financial scheme whereby
thes'e extensions, which they have decided upon, can be carried into effect. This scheme is now presented
to Shareholders, whose fullest interest and co-operation in carrying it out is sought by the Board.
The measure of the extensions most likely to attain the best economic results, regarding both the
amount of output and the cost, has only been arrived at after mature consideration by the Board and
long and continuous consultations with the General Manager and Chief Officers of the Company.
° The chief items of expenditure involved are as follows: •
(o) A further Blast Furnace, making four in all, with the additional Coke Ovens required, together
with the necessary accessories. .... , , ~ „ ,
(6) A By-Product Plant, to be used in conjunction with the present and the new Coke O e .
(c) A Duplex Steel Plant.
(d) A Continuous Mill for the production of Billets and Sheet Bars.
( e ) A duplication of the present Rod Mill. .„ . , . .
(/ A Sulphuric Acid Plant, for the supply of acid in connection with the production of Sulphate of
Ammonia, and also for galvanising in respect to wire drawing, wire netting, galvanised sheets etc
In addition, further provision will require to be made for locomotives and railway trucks, wharfage
.ccommodation, steam shovels and railway sidings, to cope with the enlarged output
The expenditure in these directions may be put down at about £3,500,000. To provide for this,
t is proposed, apart from the Company’s existing resources, to raise the requisite moneys required by
he issue of £1,500,000 7 per cent, debentures, to be issued at £97 per cent, on terms fully explained
n the Prospectus relating thereto, now being published by the Company, and by an issue of shares
lS h T r he Un a d ut r hortid'capital of the Company is £3,000,000, in 3,000 000 shares of £1 each of which
, 100 000 are already issued and fully paid, and 900,000 are available for further issue. It is
ntended to make a further issue of 420,000 (being one-fifth of 2,100,000) shares, and to offcrsuch
ssue in the first instance to the members of the Company at the price of 45/- per share, and in the
iroportion of one share for every five shares held, but without regard to fractional interests. The
erms of such offer are set out in the Notice of Issue of Shares herewith In the case of any. sharea
,ot taken in response'to the offer, these, together with the shares representing fractional interests will
, e disposed of by the Directors in such manner and at such time as they may consider most expedie t
” *it has-been 'determined 1 to Shareholders the right to renounce the allotment of the whole or
my of the shares for which they may be entitled to apply in favor of such person or persons as they
nay nominate, on the terms mentioned in the Notice of Issue of Shares herewith.
y The right to renounce gives to the Shareholder the right to sell or assign the right to allotment of
he shares, or any portion of them, for which the holder is entitled to apply, to some person as nominee,
hould the’ holder not desire to personally take up the shares. .
To effect such renunciation it will be necessary for the Shareholder to sign a renunciation in favor
if the nominee, and for any person so nominated to complete and sigq an acceptance of shares, and a
Jeclaration required by Commonwealth Regulations, in the forms which will be forwarded with the
Notices of Allotment to be sent in reply to applications by members. „„„„„ . . ...
The Directors have thought it desirable not to make the issue of the 420,000 shares a public
ssue, but to make the first offer to the Shareholders, or their nominees, as they are confident that the
scheme on these lines will be acceptable to Shareholders.
It may be of interest to know that the Wire Drawing Plant, which has been established adjacent to
his Company’s Works, is already being enlarged, while the erection of mills for the manufacture of gal-
vanised, corrugated and plain steel sheets is now well advanced, and it is anticipated operations will
ie started in or about October next. ,
A factory is also being established in the same locality for the manufacture of wire netting ana
iindred industries, which works should be in a productive position early in 1921.
The firms concerned in the industries mentioned have entered into agreements whereby they take the
whole of their steel requirements from this Company, and their factories are erected upon lands either
leased or purchased from the Company. . ,
In addition, negotiations are materially advancing in respect to the supply by the Company ot steel
for manufacture of tin plates and steel tubes.
With all these subsidiary industries progessing rapidly, together with others in contemplation, in Con-
junction with the growing demand for the Company’s manufactures, the necessity for increased pro-
duction is obvious. It is important, therefore, that the requisite arrangements for financing the erection
by the Company of new plant to meet these demands should be made without delay. _
Already considerable expenditure has been incurred in the preparation of the necessary plans, and a
material advance lias been made in the laying down of the foundations and other necessary work, in
order to facilitate, as far as possible, the early starting up of constructional work in connection with
several new plants. By Order of the Board,

“On Our Selection” was given a rousing
reception at the London Lyric by a mostly-
Australian audience. Leaving out Bert
Bailey, the only Australian in the cast was
Eva Guildford Quin, who will be remembered
in the Commonwealth as Carlotta in the
Flemming-Day production of “The Morals of
Marcus.” As an actress she has improved
greatly, and is as pretty as ever. Alec Alves,
who took Ned Duggan’s old part of Maloney,
was in Australia some years back, and
Bailey had for manager Frank Gerald, who 25
years ago ran an Australian touring co. with
lately deceased Stilling Duff. Dave as pre-
sented by an English actor, George Belmore,
was a sad circumstance after the joyous
creation of Australian Fred Macdonald, and
the Lily White of Ruby Loncraine was
merely a hopeless gawk suffering from in-
cipient imbecility. The most pleasant sur-
prise was provided by a young Irish girl,
Maureen Dillon, unknown in the West-end,
who, coached by Bailey, was a Sarah that
did not suffer even by comparison with the
excellent performance supplied in Australia
by Laura Roberts. Cranky Jack, as inter-
preted by a “restrained” English actor, was
hopelessly uninteresting, and Billy Bearup
never even began to be amusing. Whether
the show will “go” with London audiences
remains to be seen; but at another theatre,
say the Lyceum or the Adelphi, this com-
mentator would give it a very good chance.
Except for an interval when Australia’s old
friend “The Squaw Man” (produced in
London as “A White Man”) held the boards,
the Lyric has long been the home of musical
shows, and London theatres rely a good deal
upon a regular following which expects the
brand of entertainment it has been accus-
tomed to associate with, a certain house.
Still, Bailey had to butt in where he could
see an opening and it was only through a
piece of luck he was able fo find one—
at a rental of £4OO a week! The London
critics mostly tried to be friendly in a
patronising manner, and Dad was variously
described as a “bushwhacker,” “squatter”
and “bushranger.” Bailey himself has been
accorded unqualified praise, and certainly
his performance was superior to many ex-
amples of “character” acting seen in the
West-end.

ness and simplicity.
After over 30 years
of inquiry into
spiritualism, the loss
of his son has given
him a direct interest
in getting into touch
with the other world.
He is convinced that
he has done it. From
certain approved
mediums flows “com-
pressed force, a

rible, I thin k”—
which can be photo-

Such a mass of evi-
dence has Conan
Doyle acquired that
he calls the “All
humbug!” attitude of
the man-in-the-street
sheer impertinence.
Also, he is grieved by
the cold way in which all the churches
greet his offered help against materialism
in proof of a life after death. He has not
the graces of an orator, lacking the art of
a great advocate which presses home an
argument. He just puts what he considers
facts, which must, he thinks, carry convic-
tion ; and he leaves it at that. He has had
large and attentive audiences, but is not
known to have thus far made a cloud of
converts.

The first night of Verbrugghen’s new sea-
son at Melbourne Town Hall was a busy
time for his Sydney orchestra. The 80 or
so performers had their most fast-and-furi-
ous tasks after the interval, when they began
with Sneezowsky’s “Italian Caprice,” grew
even more excited in two Hungarian dances
arranged by Parlow from Brahms, and
finally became tumultuous in the Hungarian
march from Berlioz’s “Faust,” which the
audience encored by way of giving itself a
send-off. All these things were interest-
ingly done. If it be objected that a march
should be played within the limits of con-
ceivable march-time, one must also admit
that a march played to match the rapid
steps of ghostly figures in the movies is a
more exciting affair. Verbrugghen seems to
get all possible melodramatic effect from
his crowd of followers. Their discipline is
perfect, and their enthusiasm . universal,
apparently. Sometimes there comes a sharp
reminder that his young disciples are indi-
vidually weak in places, judged by the qual-
ity of Melbourne’s best professional orches-
tra, but the result of the whole combination
is what matters. Besides, such a performer
as Miss Jenny Cullen, in the violin solo of
“Le Deluge,” is good enough for anything—
in reason. The Prelude aforesaid was more
gratefully received than Elgar’s “Enigma”
variations, which had many dull moments
in it. Either it is not quite worth while or
is not thoroughly understood by anybody but
Elgar. A scarcity of audience in the south
gallery and a lack of overflow in other

parts almost suggested that the bringing
over of a Sydney brigade to play popular
programmes (beginning with “Merry Wives”
overture) was not worth while, but this
question will be decisively answered later,
iwo solos by Amy Castles received sympa-
thetic assistance from the orchestral accom-
paniment. In one or two passages of
Beethoven’s “Ah Pdrfido” the voice of the
songstress hardly rose to the occasion;
nevertheless she. declaimed with much musi-
cal force, and in the sentimental air (for
Beethoven had the old Italian ear for melody)
she sang in almost her sweetest tones.
** * *
Many Husbands,” the Courtneidge
co. s second box-office string, has not the
freshness of “The Man from Toronto,”
which it has replaced at Sydney Tivoli. The
comedy is built round a selfish young cat
who takes the word of the War Office that
her first husband is dead, marries his brother
officer, and has presented him with a son
when the first husband rolls home cheerfully
from a German prison-camp. Both soldiers
have possessed the beautiful vixen long
enough to be weary of her, and each makes
a determined effort to clear out and leave
her to the other. Finally a divorce con-
spiracy is arranged, and she is freed to marry
the young shirker-profiteer who owns a Rolls-
Koyce and a house with 28 bedrooms. The
comedy is a' poor, shallow thing, the char-
acters are not likeable, and none of them
behave naturally. Somerset Maugham should
have compressed it all into a 20-minute
sketch and looked for a more robust plot for
a three-acter. George Tully is amusing as
the cynical Husband No. 1; Frederick Moyes
is his good-humored, slow-witted successor:
Margaret Swallow makes a pretty cat, and
J. ft. Graham is once more a family solicitor.
But it s flat stuff, and once will be enough
for most people.

I auline Frederick is meeting one thing
after another at Sydney Crystal Palace and
the Lyric. Kicking off with a bad husband,
she is no sooner divorced from him and
married to a good man than Husband ll.’s
employer casts the eye of David upon her,
and he is helped in his nefarious scheme by
Husband 1., whose bad ways have brought
him down to private detecting. After that
there is a murder and a trial and the mys-
tery of “The Woman in Room 13.” Alice

A. Colquhoun’s large por-
trait of a lady has a mis-
painted eye, and so has

captured in a grey

Wilkie’s principal canvas
is a pretty brunette in a
chair; this and his other
study, “A Cosy Corner,”
are equally unambitious.
Bernard Hall's pink-faced
“Burgomaster” is more
attractive than the red-
haired nude whose uneasy
posture has merely pro-
vided the artist with an
exercise in drawing. Yet
Hall’s effort is more vera-
cious than the cuddlesome
lump of loveliness turned
out by the pastels of Cum-
brae Stewart. James R.
Jackson pictures three
nude maidens under a
tree, and he prettily shows
the sunlight struggling
through the foliage to kiss
them. Among the landscape-painters Penleigh Boyd
is prominent with a bleak aspect of winter which has
been seen before. Hampel’s “Dewy Morning” is
also an old friend, but deserves another honorable
mention, along with Louis McCubbin’s “Evening
Study” and “Mid-day Light.” Edward Officer puts his
signature to a very pleasing “Mt. Gisborne,” but
Norman Macgeorge’s “Youth and the Sea” is an arti-
ficial audacity, and Charles Wheeler’s “Little Pond”
will only get cheers from admirers of the rainbow
school. Nicholls Anderson’s “Near Warrandyte” gives
a good bird’s-eye view of some smiling country, and
there are one or two similar warmer-tinted subjects
from the brush of W. D. Knox. Streeton’s snapshot
of the arrival of the Kenown in Sydney Harbor is
arresting for the incidental panorama, but the picture
has about the same significance as a Coronation Ode.
Gustave Barnes (Adelaide), A. McClintock and
Harold Herbert prevent the art of water-color from
perishing from neglect, and Napier Waller’s talent
as a decorative illustrator gets a fine advt. in “The
Goths.” Room is made for some of Web Gilbert’s
performances in marble, plaster and bronze. One clay
study of miniature Diggers capturing a shell-hole is
surprising l in its realism.
A. H. Fullwood’s art, as shown in a hundred-odd
pictures at the Fine Art Society’s Gallery, gives the
buyer plenty of color for his money. Probably the
artist’s color sense is most pleasing in his English
scenes, but he has a snapshot off Cape Verde and a
glimpse of a valley from the shoulder of Majuba
Hill (S’Africa) that brings his fresh palette into
further notice. Of his English subjects “Falmouth
Harbor” is a massive effort which requires overtime
to study to the last ripple, but, all the same, it is
a well-handled composition. “Ludlow Castle” is a
smaller work, but here Fullwood has caught a scene
that was made for the painter, and he hasn’t missed
much of its peaceful loveliness. Another fine thing
is his wind-swept Shakspeare Cliff at Dover. You
feel that if you get too close it will blow your hat off.

Can’t Beat Coco anti t
Oil for Hair Wash.
Girls and women who wish to keep their
hair in nice condition should be most cautious
in the soap they wash it with. Most
soaps and ready-mixed shampoos contain
excessive quantities of alkali. This dries
the scalp, makes the hair brittle and is very
injurious. Just ordinary colinated cocoanut
oil (a pure, saponified but quite greaseless
liquid) is far better than the most costly
soap you could possibly use for a shampoo,
for this cannot possibly hurt your hair.
Merely wet your hair with water and rub it
on. A couple of teaspoonsful makes a perfect
flood of rich, thick, creamy lather, and
cleanses both hair and scalp thoroughly. The
lather rinses out easily, and takes with it
every trace of dust, dirt, dandruff or excessive
oiliness. The hair dries quickly and evenly,
and comes out fine and silky, bright, glossy
and fluffy, appearing to be heavier than it is.
And best of all, this colinated cocoanut oil
leaves the hair as easy to dress again as
though you hadn’t washed it at all. You can
get colinated cocoanut oil at most any chemist,
but be sure it’s “colinated,” which is not
expensive—a few ounces lasting a long, long
time.
IMPORTANT: Do not confuse colinated cocoanut
oil with cheaper sticky, emulsified cocoanut oils
or other substitutes. There is only one genuine
colinated oil, as recommended above.

both. There’s no pain nor soreness while
using Frozol-Ice, nor afterwards, since it
does not even irritate nor inflame sur-

Save a corner of your dressing-stand
for Frozol-Ice, and never let your corns
ache again. You’ll be delighted with it.

bottle is enclosed in a green-labelled

Easy Way to Get
Rid of Indigestion
Although you may have indigestion so
severely that anything but the simplest of
foods cause you the keenest suffering, there
is a simple way to get back safely to pleas-
anter, more nourishing foods. Just take a
teaspoonful of pure Salix Magnesia in a little
hot or cold water with eacn meal, and begin
at once to eat a little of any food you crave.
Salix Magnesia, which comes in the form ot
powder or tablets (never as a liquid or coarse
granules) is not a laxative, but neutralises
the excess acid in the stomach, and so prevents
or stops all the pain of indigestion. Its use
cannot, like pepsin, soda-water, etc., do the
stomach any injury, and it will soon enable
you to eat good, hearty, satisfying meals of
the foods you like best without fear of bad
results. Your chemist should be able to sup-
ply you with Salix Mag;nesia.

“Smike” : Albert Kavanagh, now at Mel-
bourne Majesty’s, must be one of the oldest
G. and S. performers in work. He was a
chorister in the, first season at London
Savoy, and getting a lift on account of his
voice started playing small parts in the first
co. that went to the U.S. lie was 18 years
without a break under the D’Oyley Carte
management, serving as light and principal
baritone and character-comedian. He was
a member of the G. and S. Co. in Melbourne
when the Kaiser broke loose, but before
that he had made himself known as Popoff
in the Meynell and Gunn production of “The
Chocolate Soldier.”
“Dido” : “The Girl for the Boy,” with no
more pretension than the rest, is the brightest
little show seen at Melbourne Tivoli for a
long time. The stars are Bailey, Cowan and
Estelle. These are the Americans who get
the solid black letters on the menu. One
is a Yank with an assertive dialect and a
voice like an electioneering campaign; an-
other is a nice girl who blows the saxophone,
an instrument that suggests a dairy in its

last agonies; the third is a dexterous banjo-
ist, more agile than musical. If the star
item could be held over till people had gone
home there would be scarcely anything to
complain about in “The Girl for the Boy.”
“Stargazer”: G. W. Anson, who has made
his positively last appearance pending the
summons of the call-boy for the resurrection,
is still remembered by thousands of Austra-
lian playgoers, who have an abiding picture
of him sitting by the fire, filling his pipe as
Eccles in “Caste.” Anson was much the
same type of comedian as Coppin and Har-
wood, unctuous and quiet. One would have
difficulty in discovering a sample of the class
now. The comedian to day is much more
of a mechanic, excepting that he works
harder than the average mechanic is willing
to do. George Anson was very homely of
face and graceless of figure, but despite these
detractions a lady member of the Brough
and Boucicault co. conceived a great affec-
tion for him. and her quest afforded the
company much edification during one Mel-
bourne season. In self-defence Anson made
a point of introducing all the plain friends
he had to the lady. On one occasion, when
he had introduced Oily Deering, he ex-
plained : “The lady is mad about ugly men,
and I am trying to find her an uglier sample
than myself-
“7s” (London) : As was to be expected.
“On Our Selection” is not going to prove a
brilliant advt. for Australia in London, if
the collection of freaks gathered for farcical
effect are accepted as typical inhabitants of
Outback—and in a speech on the first night
Bailey assured his audience that they were!
The Times next day suggested that Outback
appeared to be occupied by people afflicted
with “congenital idiocy”; another critic
remarked loftily that •“Australia must be a
very strange and very amusing country,” and
a third suggested that if the characters in
“On Our Selection” are typical Australians
the dwellers in London asylums for the
insane have a distinct grievance.
“Harrison O.”: Dramatic criticism as
practised in London is mostly a tiresome
fraud. A. B. Walkley in the Times, Wil-
liam Archer in the Star, and one or two
others maintain a
high level, but
most of the dailies
are out after sen-
sationalism rather
than criticism.

newspaper notoriety, for fresh stars have
to be discovered to keep the pot of sensa-
tionalism a-boiling.
“Palette” (London) : Australian artists
here reckon that Bert Bailey might at least
have asked one of them to design the scenery
for the Lyric Theatre production of “On
Our Selection,” instead of having it made in
Manchester. None of the “sets” are in the
same street as those used in Australia. The
back cloth, depicting the country behind the
Rudds’ home, is an excellent representation
of Sussex downs.
“T.D.M.”: It was during the season of
Johann Kruse, the violinist, at Sydney Royal
in ’B5, that two of the supporting artists
were Frank Boyle and Mrs. Armstrong,
who later became Madame Melba. They
sang solos and a duet, the tenor’s numbers
including “Good Bye” (Tostp'f while the
massive Armstrong lady was heard in “Ah,
fors e lui.” Her other song was the now
time-worn “Dear Heart.” I-remember that
concert as if it were yesterday, and will not
forget how musical Sydney failed to appreci-
ate the golden voice. They marvelled much
more at the bowing of the artistic Kruse,
who also was an Australian. The concerts
made way for the debut of Frank Boyle in
comic opera, and his sweet notes in
“lolanthe” were eagerly awaited.
“Simon”: Gerald Griffin, the Irish-Ameri-
can singing actor now at Sydney Playhouse,
is yet another who says the home-grown
article is not appreciated by Australian
managers at its true worth. A few of the
very top-notchers excepted, Griffin avers that
the mummers of Europe and the U.S.A. are
certainly no better than the mummers here.
Even on the very top-storey he instances
Australians Leon Errol and Cyril Keightley
as holding a little more than their end up
in America.
“Norbell” : There is one ghost that Conan
Doyle wouldn’t like to raise, I’ll swear, and
her name is '“Jane Annie.” In collusion
with ,T. M. Barrie, Doyle perpetrated a
comic opera of that name. It was during
one of the tiffs between Gilbert and Sulli-
van that “Jane Annie” was pushed on at
the Savoy to fill a gap—in ’92 or thereaway.
The outbreak 1 lasted for a couple of inglori-
ous weeks, and it was the best worst to
date, although sonie of the music of Ernest
Ford was bright. Kenningham struggled
manfully as Tom, the leading tenor, and he
still has nightmares in which the prin£ival
devil is a ditty with the word “thistledown”
occurring eight times in 16 lines.
From “The Oldest Inhabitant”: —
So Mrs. L. L. Lewis, whom we knew in the ’fifties
and ’sixties as Rosa Dunn, is dead. She was the
daughter of John Dunn, comedian, who came from
’Frisco with his family in the middle ’fifties. The
father and Rosa were the only performers in the
family thsn; Marion, who married Marcus Clarke,
developed later on. When George Coppin re-opened
the Olympic in Lonsdale-street, after his quarrel
with G. V. Brooke, he produced Falconer’s play,
“Extremes ; or Men of the Day,” Rosa Dunn playing
the lead. That was in 1859. Later father and
daughter became members of George Fawcett’s com-
pany at the old Princess’s Theatre, where she did the
leading business, Julia Mathews being also of the
company. She was the main female support of
Joseph Jefferson, Wheatleigh and other stars who
appeared in the “Old Matchbox” ; also she was the
original in Australia of the Colleen Bawn, Dora
Sunnyside (“Octoroon”), Barnaby ltudge (in George
Fawcett’s adaptation of Dickens’s novel) and many
others. I had the pleasure of playing, among other
things, Claude Melnotte to her Pauline. She never
cared for the stage, and when she married L. L.
Lewis, a commercial broker, ; she left it without
regret.
“B.” : I agr-ee with “0.K.” that this coun-
try ought to produce “cornet music of the
very best,” but demur to his assertion that
“no local talent has been developed in that
direction.” When the late Sydney James
heard Bert Baile at Perth he pronounced
Baile the finest cornetist he had ever heard,
and engaged him as a soloist for the Indian
tour that ended tragically for James. And
Baile, who has moved along to Newcastle
(N.S.W.), insists that he isn’t in the same
class as Percy Coad, of Ballarat. Another
fine performer whose tone is as sweet and
pure as a boy soprano’s is the veteran Hugh
McMahon, of Westralia—a “grandmaster of
the instrument” if there ever was one. But
the high-class cornetist can make a healthy
living without clambering on to the concert
platform. I would rather have Goad’s in-
come than that of any concert-artist resident
in Australia —warbler, fiddler or piano-
pounder—that “0.K.” can name.
Frank Cochrane, whom Mclntosh secured
on loan from Oscar Asche to produce “Chu
Chin Chow,” knows something about Aus-
tralia, although he has never been here be-
fore. He married Eve Titheradge, daughter
'of George, and they have twin daughters,
Pat and Pan, who are so much alike that
even their mother is not sure of them at
times. As Cochrane is only here for two
months he has come as a grass-bachelor.
“Fax” : Allan Wilkie was evidently rattled
by a discoflraging notice in the Age on his
more than respectable performance of Ham-
let. He issued some dodgers, wherein the
Age criticism of his Melancholy Dane of
years ago was contrasted with what the
same journal said the other week. If the
thin-skinned artist in Wilkie didn’t some-
times over-rule the judgment of the canny
Scot, he would have let the inconsistency
pass. The first notice gave him credit for
artistic force (which he has) and particular
flexibility of voice (which he hasn’t). The
second notice denied that he was in any way
suited to the part, in appearance or person-
ality, and declared that the words of Hamlet
were spoken without feeling. This latter
part of the slating was unjust; it is
certain that an actor who delivered Hamlet’s
multitude of lines without feeling would be-
come insufferably tedious, and Wilkie was
never a bore in the part. As for the com-
plaint against his appearance and personality,
it carries no weight. The Hamlet of the play
is understood to be a man in the thirties, not
a slender boy. Wilkie looks 1 the character
better than many older, less shapely actors
who have starred successfully in the same
capacity. And personality? The personality
of a long-ago scholar who interviewed his
father’s spectre, and whose subsequent sanity
or otherwise is a standing matter for con-
jecture, must admit of A wide range of in-
terpretation. Why worry ?
“T. 0.1.”: The two most extraordinary
Hamlets ever seen in Australia Avere McKean
Buchanan, an American who weighed about
18 stone, and Master Pole, “the juvenile
Roscius,” son of a Hebrew tailor of Mel-
bourne. The youngster played a short
season of Shakspearean characters, Hamlet
being, his chief effort. Later (alas!) he
became a super, at the old Prince of
Wales Theatre in Lonsdale-street. McKean
Buchanan was a great splutterer; yet he
found it worth while to make more than one
visit to Melbourne.
“Fax” : The memories of the very oldest
Cockney residents of Australia will be
touched by the news that John Read, for-
merly chairman at Collins’s music-hall,
passed out the other week, aged 85. Music-
halls must have been still in their infancy
“TOO MANY HUSBANDS ,” AT
SYDNEY TIVOLI.
Major Lownes (Frederick Moyes) discovers
that his wife's deceased husband
(George Tally) is still living.
when John Read filled the chair at Collins’s,
in the north of London. When he wasn’t
making announcements to the audience or
leading the applause by tapping his table
with a hammer, John used to sing songs—
good songs of their old-fashioned brand.
“Down by the Old Mill Stream’’ was one of
his own sentimental compositions, and
“Tiddley Wink the Barber” Tepresented him
in his jovial mood. The cast-iron yeteran
married a music-hall songstress G 2 years ago,
and she survives him. They made the most
remarkable couple in music-hall records.
“M.P.A.”: Leon Caron put in good work
on the Gilbert and Sullivan operas in his
day. He orchestrated every opera he con-
ducted for J.C.W. because his 16 players
were much fewer than the original orchestra-
tion was written for, and he could get more
out of the music by adapting the scor6 to
suit his band. His first G. and S. opera
under Williamson was “The Yeomen of the
Guard,” which he taught to chorus and prin-
cipals, and it was also the last he ever put
a company through. He was in Maoriland
at the time and was a dying man. His final
performance was given at Wellington, where
he said a last good-bye to Bert Royle. with
whom he had worked hand-and-glove when the
fortunes of J.C.W. himself rested on the suc-
cess of “Djin Djin” and “Matsa.” Royle
worked on the lyrics, and Caron turned out
the music and orchestration at wonderful
speed. On the night of the opening of
“Djin Djin” Williamson addressed the
players and expressed himself in words very
similar to those of Iago: “This is the night
that either makes me, or puts my pot on.”
Luckily the extravaganzas made good.
Amongst the many ballets composed by
Caron, a “Children’s Sleeping Ballet” was
written into the “Mikado” when kiddies gave
a performance of the popular opera. As a
working combination Leon Caron and Minnie
Everett have never been equalled in Austra-
lian panto, production.
“Silas” : At a swagger St. Ivilda establish-
ment where several members of a very suc-
cessful grand opera co. resided, the basso, a
great deal of a dandy, gave much annoyance
by reason of his excessive demands on the
bathing accommodation. He must have his
“great col’ bath” every morning, and it must
be prepared for him at a precise moment.
Moreover, the bath must be full. His punc-
tiliousness became a stock joke, more especi-
ally when it was found that the bath was
never used. At length the manager, faced
with an excess water-rate, expostu-
lated. “But you do not take the bath,
Signor,” he said. “Not take heem?” said
the singer. “You expec’ zat I dreenk ze
’ole bath !” “No, no, but you do not get into
it. ’ “Get eento eem!” wailed the basso,
shuddering in horror. “Get in ze col’ water!
Never! Never!” “Then Avh.y insist on
having a full bath drawn for you everv
morning?” “Ah,” said Basso, "zat ees ail
ze difference. I loove ze water. He ees so
pritty!”
BLESSED USES OF ADVERTISEMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“On the screen at the Tivoli one or two churches
now boldly advertise themselves between the bone-
less corset and the tubular cigar.”
The church, 1 sec, is now resigned
To uses of advertisement;
They call on you to fix your mind
Upon their service, as youTl find
The shops do where a shirt is meant.
, They hold these days the axiom wise:
If in your sphere you seek to rise,
You either bust or advertise !'
So worldly men who ’tend the show
Where Flos displays her pinky things
Are called upon next day to go
Confessing all the sins that flow
Resultant from these dinky things.
And so you’re gay on Saturnight,
Well knowing where to shape your flight
On Sunday morn to make it right.
Grim Satan has his places gay
Where beauty goes and wealth resorts.
I’ll look up “Paradise” some day
Where Age advertisements display
The “Beauty Spots and Health Resorts.”
To Peter crowds will represent
Before his gate they are intent
On “answering the advertisement.”
I wonder if on Sunday night,
Within a swagger church located
Up Collins-street, in colors bright,
Thrown on a screen by lurid light,
The little ad.’s reciprocated:
“Flock to the Tivoli, and see
The lively show!” These things may be —
’Tis “Thoo cla’ me, and I’ll cla’ thee!”

In the rich A.J.C. Derby on Saturday, the
pair that made the picture at the finish constituted
the entire race. None of the remaining 14 looked a
winner at any stage of the journey. In spite of his
plodding performance at Rosehill and undistinguished
work on the track afterwards, dogmatic tipsters
stuck to Strathredole .to the lift of the barrier.
Victorian capital went on him in hatsful. There
was an idea that he possessed exceptional stamina —
that all he needed was to be at hand after the first
mile. Wherefore Fingon was started as pace-maker.
But when Fingon retired Strathredole wasn’t there.
He had already blown up. The Limelight colt
Salitros then ran out in front and stayed there. He
galloped up the straight with conspicuous freedom ;
and though Malurys, a despised outsider trained on
■a suburban track, struggled to get up, the leader hit
the line with half a length to spare. Erasmus, whose
big-betting owner had backed him heavily, was a
poor third, and the rest tailed off anyhow, Speciality,
Syce Knight and Strathredole being the order behind
the place-getters. The pace had been on all the
way, the winner arriving in “32,” which is a new
record for the race. Trained by Fred Williams, who
last year was conspicuously successful with two-
year-olds, Salitros, a powerfully-shaped chestnut, had
in the last week done the best Derby gallops at
Randwick. Previously to that Williams had rather
baffled the touts by starting him in suburban sprints,
galloping him over middle distances on the track
and producing last year’s champion two-year-old,
Glenacre, for the preliminary “classics.” Salitros
will be heard of again.
While the stable’s confidence in Salitros was not
infectious, the belief of the establishment that it
had the winner of the Epsom in the Welkin horse
Greenstead was shared by a considerable section.
When Remmon beat him pointless in the Tramway
Handicap at Tatt.’s meeting it was not thought that
he could annex the Epsom with 9st. 61b. Hope
revived, however, when he won from Chrysolaus at
Rosehill, and when suspicion appeared well grounded
that Remmon would not see a mile out. From the
jump-off he was never worse than second, and when
Bundarria, who had travelled at phenomenal pace
from an outside berth to the front in the first two
furlongs, blew up at the bend, he went on alone
to the distance. There Jack Findlay swept up with
Remmon just astern, and in a strenuous battle home
Greenstead’s head remained in front. He had run
the mile in “37.” But it was desperately hard luck
for John and Remmon. The first had not been too
well served at the start, and Remmon, because of
bad manners, had been removed to the outside wing.
Also over the last bit John was certainly carried out
of his line by Greenstead. A protest was dismissed.
Jack Findlay started at 25’s (mainly on account of
his sluggish performance on the track), and had
been backed for a fortune.
Kennaquhair and Poitrel had a great battle over
the last furlong in the Spring Stakes, and the judge
gave it a dead heat. It was a matter of Poitrel
being a good deal short of his best, combined with
Bracken’s lack of artistry, rather than of Kennaqu-
hair having improved at this class of racing. Great
handicapper though the Kenilworth horse is, he is
not in the other's class as a w.f.a. performer. Kenna-
quhair reached the straight with a three-lengths’
lead, but Poitrel had run him down at the distance
and pushed to tile front. Then, to the astonishment
of Bracken, Kennaquhair came again, and it was
only in the last stride or two that Poitrel’s bacon
was saved.
Edward Watt’s All Black horse Pershore was run-
ning on so well at the end of the Spring Stakes
that he was easily spotted as likely, with a stone
and a half off. to take a leading part in the Metrop.
argument. A smart two-year-old late in his year,
• but -a horrible disappointment in the following sea-
son, Pershore has developed since into one whose
temper is as good as his looks. He took the Metrop.
without difficulty. Quickly chopping down' Fin-
mark and Kennaquhair below the leger and shaking
off the fast-finishing Ecarte at the distance, he came
on and won by a good length and a half. Joe Kil-
lorn said it was an easy ride. Finmark was again
well licked. Of the others Syce Knight, who fin-
ished just behind Ecarte, was doing best and con-
firming William Booth’s estimate of him as a future
stayer
The Poitrel-Ivennaquhair dead-heat at
Randwick was an accident. It was due to the flash-
ness of young Bracken, who stopped riding when
Poitrel was a neck to the good. But there was
no fluke about the double dead-heat in the first
division of the Rosebery Cup three days before.
In this mile and three furlongs event, Kilwa, ridden
by Phil Kuhn, finished dead level with Heavy Fire,
which Arthur Kuhn leathered home. A run-off was
decided upon, and again the two passed the post
locked together. Backers of Kilwa, the favorite,
yelled for a third race, but the owners agreed that
their property had had enough. The Kuhns are
twins, and their effort amounts to a world's record.

Saturday’s racing at Flemington appeared
to settle the pretensions of some that had been
talked of for one or both of the Cups. In the
Stand Handicap, which last year fell to the destined
Caulfield Cup winner, a rank outsider in Terwyne,
a six-year-old mare of no pretensions, carried her
minimum weight ahead of Lord Setay, Tangalooma,
Scottish Knight and Red Dome from start to finish,
and only Drumore could beat the despised pacemaker.
Drumore undoubtedly showed in this race his best
public form to date. Ten days earlier the five-year-
old son of Wallace ran a dead-heat with Duntrim
over a mile and three furlongs, but won the run-off
easily. The two races on the same afternoon must
have done the backward nag a world of good, for on
Saturday he covered more ground, and stayed longer,
than any of his opponents. His previous position in
the Melbourne Cup market was at once justified,
and the question arose as to his being forward
enough to win the Caulfield event if called upon.
Drumore js still a bit above' himself in condition —
perhaps a good bit above himself. The suspicion of
unsoundness which has attached to him since he
“broke down” in a race last year is said to be
warranted no longer. Although he ran with his shins
bandaged on Saturday there was no sign of lameness
about him after the race when the bandages were
removed. As far as Victorian opposition goes he
looks a very likely Melbourne Cup winner. At any
rate, he should beat all that finished behind him
last Saturday, and indirectly Drumore has somewhat
shaken faith in Eurythmic, whose stable companion
Tangalooma was backed down to 4 to 1 for the
Stand Handicap aforesaid. Moreover, Phil Heywood,
the trainer of Drumore, seems to be getting luck to
compensate him for the going amiss of Artilleryman.
The victory of Salatis in the coifs’ division of the
Maribyrnong Trial seemed a rather lucky coup for
Ileywood’s stable. The tall, striking son of Shep-
herd King and Traquette flew away from the barrier
and led the field throughout the journey. Racing
along next to the inside rails he appeared to be
winning easily, but in the last 200 yards Sefton, on
the outside, gained a lot of ground and was only a
trifle too late at the finish. Salatis was tiring. His
quick start had done the trick, but his finish didn’t
justify his hot favoritism. A njuch easier victory
was scored by Sister Olive in the fillies’ division of
the . same two-year-old event. The slippery lady
(daughter of Red Dennis) never gave her opponents
a chance, and although Shepherd Queen was placed
second there never was a hope for Shepherd King, the
coming sire, to score a double event with his progeny
in this first youngsters’ race of the Victorian season.
Two handsome imported racers of 'not long ago
haying made their stud marks in the Maribyrnong
Trial, it was up to Eurythmic to win the October
Stakes. Eurythmic’s sire, Eudorus, was imported
by Clark and . Robinson, like Red Dennis, and was
a more productive racer than the vile-tempered nag
who got his name from his auburn coat. The w.f.a.
race was a gift for Eurythmic as it was run, but the
time (2min. 49sec. for 12 furlongs), gave no hint as
to the staying capacity of the Caulfield Cup cert.
Still the fact remains that the best stayer in the
country could have
done no more than
win as comfortably as
Eurythmic did. His
Westralian form indi-
cates stamina enough
for the Caulfield jour-
ney, anyhow, so the
presence of the dead
bird promises to scare
away some that might
have accepted for the
big handicap on Satur-
day week. Mean-
while the first and
second days at Caul-
fi e 1 d will probably
bring more grist to
the Eurythmic mill,
without testing the
favorite’s capacity to
go a mile and a half
with full steam up.
The Toorak Handicap
may reveal a worthy
foeman to him from
among locally-trained
horses, but unless The
RoVer or some such
lightweighted dark
one rushes into evi-
dence on Saturday, it
will seem that only a
brilliant stranger from
Sydney can challenge
him in the betting.
Drumore excepted, of
course.
Dr. W. H. LANG,
handicapper to the
V.R.C.
“B.”: Those who took evens about Poitrel
for the Spring Stakes at Randwick on Saturday
only got their money back; the tote paid 14s. 6d.
for ten bob. Which shows that the tote can some-
times beat the book even under the stupid and out-
of-date A.J.C. system. There should be two totes,
a straight-out and a place: this would convenience
the small punter, who is the mainstay of racing;
enable the club to pay bigger divvies; and do away
with a superfluous swarm of silver-hunting, price-
cramping bag-flappers. The number of bookmakers,
real and alleged, fielding at Randwick could be pro-
fitably reduced .by at least a third. More tote-space
and less ring-space is what the public wants.
The four miles of Adelaide Hunt Cup saw
all the starters but three in trouble when the straight
was reached. Haberdasher, from Tasmania, looked
like a winner, but fell at the last jump, leaving
Ruralist from the South-East with a good lead; but
The Navy drew comfortably away at the finish. The
totalisator handled far more than ever before, and
the meeting produced at least one fine amateur rider
in young Alan McFarlane, who won the Bracelet
Handicap.
WARWICK
ARMSTRONGS
who has been
chosen to captain
Australia in the
first test match
against the
English XI.
Sydney grade cricket season opened on
Saturday ; and, Eight Hour Day intervening, the first
round was got through. Playing for Sydney against
Wests, Collins, the A.I.P. skipper, scratched 49.
Brown’s 8Q was sparkling by contrast. West’s bowl-
ing was of the length variety, but it lacked sting.
Wall got the average. Jack Gregory, for Sydney,
unwound a fair amount of pace, and his six wickets
(for 48) were all clean bowled. The imperishable
M. A. Noble made 58 for Paddington against Waver-
ley, his batting having plenty of wood behind it, and
Trenerry, after a couple of lives got 168 n.o. by
very orthodox cricket. Norths pitted a strong
batting side against C. Cumberland, but only Punch
(79) proved up to sample. Gar Waddy knocked up
109, spurning all the Shore bowlers alike; and
Cranney (79) was, if possible, more contemptuous.
Glebe have an acquisition in keeper 01dfield(ex-A.1.F.),
and with Kelleway, W. Bardsley, Bogle and Gray
are a strong team. Kelleway’s five wickets against
Uni. averaged a shade under 10 apiece. Middle
Harbor have only a fair team, with Mailey as cap-
tain and star performer. They met Petersham ; and
Adams, favored by the usual ill-prepared village
wicket, scattered disaster among them. Six for 64.
Andrews was Petersham’s top-scorer with 88 —a
blameless effort. Mailey’s twisters (five for 129)
were fairly successful. Gordon are a strong “paper”
batting side, but against Balmain Dr. Tozer (110)
and Macartney alone shone.
Claude J. Tozer (“Towser” to cricket
patrons) has early got his eye in: he made HO
for Gordon v. Balmain. Last year he was in the
N. XI in Sheffield Shield matches, and also
scored a brilliant 103 v. Queensland. He isn’t new
to big cricket, and scored most runs in premiership
cricket in 1910-11 (794, averaging 72.18) and .1913-
14 (842, averaging 51.50). Tozer was wounded in
France. He has the D.S.O.
■* * * *
W. L. Trenerry (Paddington), who
knocked up a brilliant 168 not out v. Waverley in
the opening round of Sydney premiership cricket,
is one of the younger men with a big chance of a
job in the Australian XI. He had a three years’
innings in khaki, and scored a Military Cross and a
lieutenancy at Pozieres. At the Armistice Trenerry
joined the A.I.F. XI, and in all matches in England
scored 1254 runs, averaging 31.35, the best being 118
v. Scotland at Glasgie. Another of the family is E.
Trenerry, a fine all-rounder with a penchant for
big efforts. There are less things likely than the
brothers being in the State XI this season.

Old champion George Giffen was a weir
come guest at the 49th annual meeting of S.A.
Cricket Association, which reported a membership so
large that it has to be checked. The lease of the
ground from Adelaide Corporation runs out three
years hence, but a renewal seems a matter of course;
and the Football League has agreed to use the ground
for another seven winters. The meeting said regretful
things about the loss of E. T. Smith, for many years
its president and sound adviser. Mostyn Evan, who
has been acting chairman for some years, was
elected in his place.

Many pugs hold that there are worse ways
of losing a fight than on a foul; and Jamito, the
russet-hued little tornado from the Philippines,
appears to be one of them. At Sydney Stadium on
Saturday night Sid Godfrey had him well in hand
after the first half-dozen rounds. By the time the
half-way mark had been passed nothing but the
direct interposition of Providence could have brought
the visitor victory, and he hit the right hook special-
ist low. Joe Wallis failed to see it or something;
and a couple of rounds later the offence was
repeated. When the colored youth gave his uncon-
ventional hit a third fly for luck in the 18th, the
referee rose to the occasion and handed the bays
to the lad from Auburn. Jamito boxed well—for
him. As a result of the instruction he has received
here he will return to his tropic home a hundred
per cent, better craftsman than he was when he
arrived in Sydney. And, of course, he was game,
and always liable to land a dangerous punch. But
Godfrey was too clever for him, and though unable
to drop one on a vital spot—Jamito’s guard for the
near side of his chin was Gibraltar-like in its im-
pregnability—yet he got home persistently every-
where else. There were four good prelims.—two
between feathers and two between welters.

At Melbourne Cricket Ground on Satur-
day, before Sir Conan Doyle and 53,908 others,
Richmond won its first League premiership, beating
the reliable Magpies by 7 goals 10 behinds to 5 goals
5 behinds. Both play much the same game and
both had their star goal-kickers—Lee and Bayliss—
out through unfitness; but always the Yellow and
Blacks were a trifle faster, a shade surer and a scrap
more co-operative. Play was perhaps a thought too
strenuous; but it was always clean. ’Wood was
stronger in defence, Dobrigh, Saunders and Tyson
doing best, while Coventry—a new “find” from
Diamond Creek—shone out forward. For the Tigers,
Herbert, Hugliie James and Don did most, though the
most effective man on the ground was their rover,
Clarry Hall. When Con McCarthy resigned ’Wood’s
captaincy after winning the pennant last year Dan
Minogue thought he ought to be skipper. The team
thought otherwise. So Daniel resigned, transferred
to Richmond, and was elected captain. It was
largely through his leadership that ’Wood went down
in the grand final.

The Ass. having decided that liist week’s
abortive football match between ’Scray and North
should be re-played, some 12,000 partisans paid
£5BO to view the uproar. The collision was willing.
The Law was kept busy soothing excited barrackers,
and in the last quarter both mounted and foot police
hastily got among the players themselves and smoth-
ered what promised to be a brawl. North was lead-
ing by a trifle; then ’Scray got a goal and a two-
point lead. North responded, and once more got
ahead ; then, just as the bell was about to ring, Dr.
Park, who used to play for ’Varsity,' punted a goal
and gave his side the game by 69 points to North’s
65. ’Scray will now meet Brunswick in the final.
In N.S.W. Rugby League premiership
matches this year, Frank Burge (Glebe) was top-
notcher with 110 points (16 tries and 31 goals).
Next came A. Oxford (Souths) 86 (2 tries and 40
goals), Wally Messenger (Easts), 82 (8 tries 29
goals, L. Wall (Wests), 65 (3 tries and 28 goals).
Gordon Wright (East’s wing three-quarter) wus
greatest try-getter with 18; he also headed in 1919
with 17. In the City Cup events A. Oxford topped
with 29 points (1 try 13 goals), with D. Thompson
(Norths) next with 20 (10 goals). Burge scored
five (a try and goal). The aggregate total left
Burge and Oxford (both forwards, by the way) with
115 each. Strange to note, of the above leading
point-scorers only Burge caught the eye of the selec-
tors- in the international matches this year.

Western Suburbs (Rugby League) for-
wards have a unique record in Sydney City Cup
finals. In the past three years only seven players
have been called on for the six positions. Leddy,
Iteidy, Courtney, Joass and Redmond were in them
in 1918-19-20, Prentice in 1918 and ’2O, and Tye
in 1919-20.

N.S.W. Rugby League is again on the
grab. Finding the Agricultural Ground authorities
hitting up percentages, the League outbid the Soccer,
Rugby Union and lacrosse people, and next season
will find the League in control. The evicted sports
look like finishing their days in the unenclosed spaces
of Moore Park.

Wellington’s triumphal progress through
M.L. for the Ranfurly Shield had an unexpected
bump at Invercargill, where Southland defeated them
by 17 (4 tries and 2 goals) to 6 (try and penalty
goal). In the previous week Wellington had defeated
Otago (16 —5)- and Manawutu (24 —6). Southland
won with great forward rushes. It is the first time
the South Island has had the Shield on the side-
board.

Sydney Flying Squadron staged an 18-
footer handicap for the first race of the season.
There were two heats over the Club’s No. 2 course,
and Swastika (the best-rigged ’bus of the day),
sailed by Billy Edney, and Onda, with Rear-Commo-
dore Jim Firth at the stick, won them. In the final,
Onda, with a full ballooner up, carried the wind to the
first rounding mark at Shark beach, and there hauled a
breeze with 2i min. to spare from Desdemona, who
led Pastime by Jmin. In the punch to the Rose
Bay buoy Onda made one leg to Shark Island,
closely followed by Pastime and Desdemona, who
lost fully a minute in stays. Swastika then went
through the fleet like a pickpocket, and was the
nearest to Onda when sheets were eased for the lead
home to Clark Island. In the final stretch Firth
seemed to have the race in hand. However, with
ballooner and spinnaker drawing he made the
mistake of keeping too close under Point Piper, as
also did Edney in Swastika. Geo. Degan pulled
away into midstream with Hero and with ringtail
spinnaker, ballooner and topsail aloft, soon headed
the leader. Onda seemed to have the bailer over-
board, and Firth never attempted a topsail or ring-
tail. Hero (Geo. Degan) eventually caught the
judge’s eye with a lead of 45sec. from the rear-
commodore.
F. W. Edwards, at Sydney C. of E. Gram-
mar championship last week, broke the tape first in
100yds. (10 3-ssec.—the best time of any schools’
athlete this year), 120yds. hurdles (16 2-ssec. —
school record), 220yds. (23see.) and 440yds. (58
2-ssec.). He won the football-kicking event (60yds.
2ft. 9in.) and was second in broad jump and throw-
ing the cricket ball. L. O. Rutherford did the half-
mile (2min. 12Jsec.) and mile (4min. 56 2-ssec.).
Rutherford stroked the school eight in last year’s
G.P.S. race. At King’s School, E. L. Potts won the
100yds. and got seconds in 220yds. and 440yds.;
while G. A. Hetherington took the half-mile in
2min. 12 3-ssec. and the mile in 4min. 67 2-ssec.
At St. Ignatius, R. Campbell won the 440yds. (56
2-ssec.) and half-mile (2min. 11 3-ssec.) and
filled places in five other events. A remarkable
14-year-old (J. Bombelli) lifted the Challenge Cup in
the Marist Brothers’ High School sports. Starting
in six events he won the 75yds. and the 220yds.

Whence comes
all that is
exclusive
Before it became fashionable for Sassiety
women to puff cigarettes Lady Talbot used to
have a whiff, but strictly on the quiet. Sunny
Jim Skene, who is now under the sod, was
permanent head of the Lands Department
when S’Reginald Talbot was the Rubber
Stamp, and went for a trip with the vice-regal
couple to Gippsland. Before the party had
reached Dandenong Skene said his pet
abomination was a woman who smoked, and
he felt the toe nearly squeezed oft' him.
The A.D.C., who had thus put on the brake,
got Skene out into the next compartment be-
fore the atmosphere in the vice-regal car be-
came too chilly, and asked him why the
he wanted to be so personal. Couldn’t a very
ladylike woman have one little weakness?
The Genthelp, who was given a free hand,
managed to tell the Talbot dame that Jim
Skene must never be taken seriously when
he got away from the office table.
As_ Earl Stradbroke does not intend, to
sail till January there is really no great hurry
for the selection of a vice-regal town house
in place of Stonington, which has to be
given up. It is likely, however, that when
Ministers get over the elections they will
make a choice. At the week-end Kilbride
at Ileyington and Fairlie jHouse at South
Yarra were understood to be high in favor
with the Cabinet sub-committee.
Photos of the earl and his lady show a
moustachioed man of the orthodox johnnie
type and a countess who would easily pass
for a younger sister of the late luckless
Countess of Dudley, wearing her hair puffed
out above the ears.
The death of O’Hara Wood, four or five days
after the departure of his wife aud daughter
from England on their return journey, was
a great shock to friends of the family. In
the legal profession and outside of it every-
body spoke kindly of O’Hara Wood. Married
to a daughter of Justice Holroyd, he was
said a few years ago to be likely to get a
County Court judgeship himself, and per-
haps he was a disappointed man before lie
suffered a great grief in the death of his
brilliant son Arthur. Young Arthur, the
Victorian tennis champion, had completed
his medical course when the. war broke out,
and then he joined the Flying Corps because,
ak he said, he thought Britain would have
more need of aviators than of surgeons at
the Front. His parents made no attempt to
dissuade him. All went well until the last
year of the war; and then the boy was
killed in action. His brother Pat, who en-
listed for ground service, returned with the
rank of captain. To him fell the melancholy
duty of burying his father whilst his mother
and sister were out of hearing of their loss.
The High Court Isaacses are within
measurable distance of departure on tour.
His Honor has arranged for 12 months’
leave. The holiday will have its official
commencement on Feb. 1, which from a lay-
woman’s point of reckoning means that the
weary wig will quit business cares when
the Court adjourns at Christmas. Daughter
Nancy, formerly his associate, is now married
and settled in England.
On Thursday afternoon Kurneh, the Nor-
man Brookes’s newly-decorated humpy, was
wedged with a mass of the Naicest, etc. The
cause was the Newsboys’ Ball on October 22.
W. M. Hughes was roped as the star turn.
He appealed to the assembled from
a bank of arum-lilies and looked as
coy as the infant Moses did in his
bassinette. But he stirred up his frilly
audience. One matron choked over her
cream-puff and declared she would vote for
him at the next election no matter what her
husband said. Mrs. Norman Brookes was
clad in a discreet twine-colored muslin with
a black toque swept by a black plume. Laura
Armytage, just back from London, listened
and applauded. Mrs. Walter Bayles was in
an attractive putty-tinted suiting. And Mrs.
Stein glanced with approval on a spread
with nary a coqktail or cigarette.
Some of the scions of the oldest Hebrew
families are once more in Melbourne. Mrs.
Sam Cohen, back from an English jaunt, is.
with her mother, Mrs. E. D. Hart, at Charn-
tvood, St. Kilda. She was Elma Hart and
has a beauty like unto Lina Cavalieri’s. Mrs.
Rudolf Benjamin, an ornate dresser, is at
Menzies’. She belongs to the tribe of Law-
rence Benjamin, which owns fleets of city
properties.
Mrs. William Smith gave a tea one day
last week to show off the beautiful embroid-
eries she ordered from Italy. These will
stock the sale of work Mrs. Crivelli is hold-
ing at White Lodge, on October 12, for the
orphans of France. Mrs. Smith now flies
huge posters at White Lodge. The place
and furnishings will be sold this month.
Later on Mrs. Smith, with’her two daughters
and sons-in-law (Mr. and Mrs. Dease, and
Mr. and Mrs Pender), will settle across
seas and spend their good Australian money
abroad.
Bibron’s cabaret ball on Friday night
sparkled despite the cancelling of the wine
list at these frivols. Incidentally, it is
not always the liquor which is there
that causes disaster, but the stuff that
patrons carry in their overcoat pockets.
Paul, who is tracking off to America and the
Fog, will wind up the season with dances
on Derby and Steeplechase eves.
When the jazzers and super-jazzers do the
lancers it is time to call the ambulance. At
“Poss” Chirnside’s farewell dance, at the
Norton Grimwades’ borrowed (but empty)
mansion, there was a whirling set which
smashed one returned Digger’s glass eye and
winded the fair daughter of a mining-man.
The girl took the count, and there was con-
siderable alarm until her heart was heard
still at work.
A specially sportive jazz occurred at Glen-
bervie, Toorak, last weeh. It was organised
by Ted Yencken for a selected portion of
the Best. Brother-in-law Ken Menzies aided
the host, whose camp-fires were kept burn-
ing well into the small hours. The Sam
McCaughey dame exhibited black satin charm-
euse drapings and her own special smile.
Pretty Gwen Grimwade wore pale primrose
georgette, and Mrs. Simon Fraser was sub-
dued in black. The Moule sisters were in
black and yellow respectively; Nell Stead
wore white, and sprightly Rosa Spowers
danced in rose-sprinkled ebony net. A full
supply of men partners had been thought-
fully laid on.
The Housewives’ Association is still a nest
of ants, and there’s something of the “bull-
dog” about most of
them. The members
pay next-to-nothing
a year, and spend the
money in organising
the purch as e of
wholesale supplies for
retail distribution.
Mrs. A. A. Whit-
hain (pictured here-
with) was the
president who did a
vast amount of the
early spadework;
and Eleanor Cam-
eron Glencross, once
the best-known
woman political or-
ganis e r in N. S.
Wales (her name
stopped at the
“Cameron” then), is the most persuasive
platform enthusiast of a body whose mission
in life is to go out into the high-price ways
and the food-profiteer to give in.
Adelaide’s nibful of news:—
The Munro Fergusons’ final visit, after a storm
of dinners, ended with a crowd waiting to wave
off the East-West train, while Smeaton, M.P. and
Mayor, read a dozen or so good-bye verses, in broad
Scotch, and his own composition.
After the revived Hunt Club races this village won’t
languish under tli« reproach that it produces only a
dowdy crowd. The Bracelet went to Mrs. Alan
McFarlane—a most popular win. Her son was 'the
brilliant rider.
Conan Hoyle’s lectures have drawn curiously mixed
crowds to the Town Hall. The two lectures billed
were extended to four, and the public would have
had still more if he would have given it. He snatched
a day off to motor to Humbug Scrub, where natural-
ist Bellchambers has his wonderful reserve. He
sums up Bellchambers as a mixture of the New Forest
Brusher and Thoreau—more refined than the first
and less literary than the second—and was so im-
pressed with what is being done there to protect bird
and animal life that he has appealed to the Govern-
ment to extend the reserve and make it official and
permanent.
Another local nature-lover, George Archer Russell,
whose pen sketches find constant space in local papers,
has departed along the back tracks to Sydney. His road
will lie up the Murray as far as the Murrumbidgee,
and from there across the Riverina to the mountains
and Sydney. He has wandered in Africa and the
Far East as well as here, and saw Gallipoli in 1915
as a member of the A.I.F.
Singer Francis Halls, whose bass has hitherto been
trained by Frederick Bevan, is bound for Europe
to put in further work there, and was given a com-
plimentary concert the other evening. The audience
was not as large as it should have been.
Part of the new Federal vice-regal staff arrived
on Wednesday and lunched at Government House.
The new-comers were Lord and Lady Digby, Gapt.
and Mrs. Hill-Rivers and Lieut. G. Norman, R.N.
The Forsters appeared later, and are at the moment
the guests of their old friends the Weigalls.
Parsons were a habit in the family of Mrs. Mary Ann
Padman, who has gone aloft at 94. Her father was
the Rev. John Waterhouse, and she married Thomas,
a son of the Rev. Thomas Padman, who brought her
to Adelaide in 1848. Three of her brothers were
Methodist ministers, and three grandsons follow the
same calling.
Adelaide’s hockey girls finished their prolonged
struggle for the premiership when, in the third
game, the Arohas managed to knock a goal eight
minutes before time, and flustered but undaunted
’Varsity decided, with Whitman, that when it couldn’t
be helped, defeat was great, too.
Jeanie Lucinda, Lady Musgrave, dead in England
at 86, was the widow of Anthony Musgrave, Governor
of S. Aus. from 1873 to 1877. One of their sons,
Major Herbert Musgrave, was killed in the war.
Their only daughter died at Adelaide Government
House at the age of six.
Laver, of the Melbourne Conservatorium, has given
a testimonial to the South Aus. system of training
■children’s voices. He was at the annual concert
given by 1000 performers for the benefit of a
schools’ decoration fund —it is always such a popu-
lar success that it has to be repeated. Artistically,
Laver reported, it is “a credit to the Education
authorities, and other States should emulate their
example. The enunciation of the children is delight-
ful to listen to.”
Heiress Verna Johnston and her widowed
mother are back again and sheltering at
Menzies’ Hotel. Verna has just engaged her-
self to Lionel Armstrong, of the. Western
District clan. As both parties are very
young the wedding won’t happen yet awhile.
May Woodward, of Bendigo, has just
been married to Charlie Barnard, well-liked
in tennis circles. It took place from the
Ivimpton home in Toorak. Maisie worked
in the Park-lane Hospital, run by Dr.
Shields. Shields’s nurses are going off this
season like hot muffins.
Widow Macdonald (whose husband, Sir
Claude Macdonald, was British Minister in
Peking during the siege of the legations, and
afterwards became Ambassador at Tokio)
recently hostessed the wedding of Gywndoline
Garsia, of Christchurch. Her father, Cap-
tain Christopher Garsia, was a 79th Cameron
Highlander before he came to Maoriland.
The bridegroom is Edward Brassey Berthon.
Major Douglas Dickinson, D. 5.0., of the
Staff College, Camberley (Eng.), and
Frances Wilson, daughter of Cracroft Wil-
son, Christchurch (M.L.), have made a date.
The lady is famed for war work and good
golf.
Mrs. Fred Taylor, from Brisbane, camped
awhile with the Brudenell Whites at South
Yarra ere departing on Wednesday for Lon-
don. The wedding of her niece Beatrice
Yaldwyn, recently here with the “Peg o’ My
Heart” co., and one Frank Swan, hailing
from Singapore, is part of Mrs. Taylor’s
travel plan. Latest word of Beatrice told
of a trip to Paris. Incidentally, she
divulged that she was getting 24-button even-
ing gloves from Florence for Bs. 6d. a pair !
A St. Kilda wedding in a local mosque
was curiously disturbed the other day. The
proceedings had reached a crucial point, when
a tall, slim young gentleman, perfectly
dressed, and wearing the expression of
fatuous goodwill which whisky alone can
produce, and bearing a wreath, came rambling
up the aisle. The wreath was composed of
white flowers, excepting for those in purple,
which spelled “In Memoriam.” The Johnnie
arrived near the altar, and stood, his wreath
very much in evidence, taking his bearings.
Then he uttered a “Wow” of delight. “Oh,
there you are, there you are!” he cried, and
breaking through all restraint advanced upon
the bride, and hung his solemn offering
about her neck.
Whilst Irma Caron was appearing lately
in Palmerston (M.L.), with her own one-
girl show, she received a letter from an un-
known admirer —the sort of letter more often
read about in fiction than written in fact.
The soul of this enthusiast was stirred, appa-
rently, by the French fire and daintiness of
Irma’s art, for he regretted that he couldn’t
have a second experience of her “exquisite
muniere,” inasmuch as he was returning to
his occupation of boundary-riding in the
morning—away up in the ranges. He must
have written his letter overnight in a fervor
of enchantment. “Your delightful entertain-
ment,” he said, “will linger as . a fragrant
memory in those lonely places for many days
to come. Au revoir, artiste charmante! May
the Muses ever aid you in so favoring your
audiences.” And the cynics tell you there is
no romance in the world ! But perhaps one
has to be a boundary-rider ’way up in the
ranges to feel like that.
Lorna Reid, whose songs at the piano in
the Margaret Cooper manner win applause
at musical At Homes, is to give a concert
at the Playhouse on October 14. Mrs. Stein
has formed a committee to help.
Were Amy Castles more anxious to make
less of herself she would never appear, as
she did on Saturday at the Town Hall, in
a gown, however soft and sheeny, which
might have been woven from vanilla ice-
cream suffused by a maiden blush. The pale
outfit showed no mercy to the matronly
figure, nor did a waist broadened by a wide
sash look the more willowy for being fol-
lowed by a pannier-tuck. However, the com-
posure of Amy, as she stood with her bare,
braw arms linked in a handclasp across her
middle register, was as impressive as ever.
And her smile! When she looked up at the
conductor to thank him for the accompani-
ment it achieved a most gracious effect. In
the Castles pose and manner you get the
calm expression of unpretentious self-confi-
dence. Though not as winsome as Dolores
she is more placidly engaging than Melba,
and the balance of plumpness between her
face and the rest of her is well maintained.
As for her singing on Saturday—well, her
contour was not rounder than her best notes.
Ruth Hollick gives you the latest of
Arthur Goodsall. the costume-expert who is
helping Allan Wilkie to clothe his Stiaks-
peareans in a seemly manner. Goodsall is
a savant on his sub-
ject. He was en-
gaged in London by
William Po e 1 for
the celebrated pro-
duction o £ "Every-
man” which took
eight months to pre-
pare and ran for
four years, lie also
designed 5000 cos-
tumes for a remark-
able historical page-
ant at Bath (Eng.).
Previously connected
with Wilkie on a
long Asiatic tour, he
was snapped up
again when Wilkie
came to Melbourne.
One of his first jobs
at the Princess’s was to dye 500 yards of
material a lively green to provide back-
grounds for Macbeth, Hamlet and the other
heroes who are to follow. Goodsall went to
France with the A.1.F., and during lulls in
the argument cheered the Diggers with bits
of Sheridan, Shaw and other dramatists.
The actor cherishes a picture of himself as
Sir Peter Teazle playing to a Lady Teazle
who in her spare time bombed Fritz in most
unladylike style.
Eda Bennie, a Melbourne girl, is doing
well in the Carl Rosa Co. in London. She
lias been singing Mi mi in “Bohbme,” Gilda
in “Rigoletto,” Marguerite in “Faust,” and
lately did the part of Isabel in the first pro-
duction of “Quentin Durward.” Previously
she gave her bright voice an airing in the
Quinlan Co. in Australia, playing the Doll
in “Hoffmann” and the ragpicker in
“Louise.” Then she had four valuable years
with the Reecham Opera Co. in Britain. The
songstress, who is a Marchesi product, is
a daughter of Chief-Inspector Bennie, of the
Bank of Victoria.
Speaking of Boyd’s recent pottery show
in the Arts and Crafts rooms in Collins-
street. Most of Boyd’s ware proclaimed his
country in some way. The gem of the col-
lection was a ciel-blue jar depicting a pas-
toral scene. Nearly every small piece found
room to trail a gumleaf. One had a quaint
sliprail scene. Two very handsome glori-
fied mugs in beauteous shades of mauve and
pink rejoiced in handles which the clever
potter must have fashioned whilst his mind
was on gum-trees.
Eight hundred people associated them-
selves with the pilgrimage to Adam Lindsay
Gordon’s grave in Brighton Cemetery on
Sunday afternoon. After visiting the broken
column of bluestone, with white marble
panels, which marks the spot where the
poet was laid 50 years ago, the “pilgrims”
assembled on the reserve at the main
entrance, where addresses and recitations
were delivered and one song was sung.
Senator Russell; Fleming, M.H.Ii.; Alan
Moir, headman of the A.N.A.; Maurice Phil-
lips, Chief Clerk of the Supreme Court —
these and others more or less eminent were
the panegyrists and moralists. Nature was
kind in providing a perfect spring day.
State primary teachers had a beano at
the week-end to celebrate the receipt of the
first instalment of their substantial rises.
The average for men and women pedagogues
was 40 per cent, on old screws. The increases
in the case of men taken separately ranged
from £36 to £163, and in the case of women
from £24 to £132. Three months’ arrears
—from July I—were paid. Never did the,
kiddies find their trainers so amiable as on
the Monday morning after.
Time has been flying, as usual, since
Juliette Wray, sometime leading lady for
J.C.W. in comic opera and musical comedy,
left the stage to marry an Auckland medical
man, Dr. Sharman. Nowadays the slim
Juliette of long ago has a bouncing 19-year-
old daughter, who talks of following in
mother’s stage footsteps as far as mother
went, and proceeding further in her own
footsteps. Mrs. Sharman shares her daugh-
ter’s hopes, and is going to bring the bonnie
girl to Australia to interview the Combine.
Whilst in Norway Melba sang for the
benefit of the Norwegian relatives of sailors
who lost their lives during the war. The
concert took place at the National Theatre
at Christiania. An orchestra under Johan
Halvorsen backed up Nellie, who gave a
sheaf of numbers from Mozart. Puccini, Verdi
and Bemberg Arditi. The audience waited
from midnight to gain admission, and then
many were unable to get in. The day after
the concert the Dame was bidden to lunch
with the King anu Queen, and was decorated
by them with yet another order.

COMMUNITY PLATE (Knives, Forks, Spoons)
has spread among the homes of the many
what formerly had heen reserved for the few
table appointments of elegance and heauty, delight-
ful in design and exhibiting rich patterns in the
period styles of Adam, Patrician, Hepplewhite and
Sheraton.
But, since wear must influence the minds of intending
purchasers to a great extent, it is good to know that
embodiment o£ beautiful design sacrifices nothing of
usefulness.
Community Plate (Knives, Forks, Spoons) withstands
the wear of thrice-da ; ly use for half-a-century. It is
heavily plated over all, and is re-in£orced with visible
discs of pure silver where wear is severest, which
makes it practically wear-proof. The designs are
exclusive. Each pattern is limited to the one grade
and the one name.

A WOMAN’S
LETTER

Cataloger.
There was no comfort at Rand wick on
Saturday, and elegance only showed in spots.
The Spring meeting was a sort of human
salad with a dressing to suit each one’s
taste, and the result was not highly decora-
tive. The cloud masses on the windy sky
had something to do with the wearing of
the winter tailor-made and fur cape that
rubbed shoulders with the sheerest of organ-
dies, short-sleeved and low of neck, whose
wearer froze with smiling mouth, though her
elbows put up a purple protest. Jersey
cloth and taffetas came out in great force,
and the female footwear alone represented
the value of three first prizes in Tatt.’s. The
State Exes, were there, and Dame Mar-
garet’s dressing, which suggested a varie-
gated flower-bed, was surrounded by the
Lamb and d’Apice couples.
The coolness of linen is to be a feature of
the summer girl’s outfit, judging by the cal-
culating eye of desire that was cast on Mrs.
Metcalfe Jackson, who was crisply cool in a
geranium-pink model, and Jeanette Gordon,
who looked handsome in linen of lobelia-blue
that carried well-cut side-frills. The
MacCormick lady was one of the elegant
spots of the meeting in a black and white
symphony; daughter Alison’s choice ran to
grey and rose-pink. Mrs. Colin Stephen, in
navy satin, walked about with strong Knox
supports; Mrs, Rolin and Mrs. Beaudesert
Collins were entrants for the beauty stakes;
Mrs. Macneil Simpson looked like a cool
green lettuce in jersey silk; the Jaques
womenfolk were there, with a Debrett ready
for titled strangers; the Belgian Consul and
his wife picked winners or losers with smil-
ing faces; Muffle Layton chaperoned her tall
father; the Christchurch Seligs, waiting for
dad to come back from the newspaper
talk in Canada, were plainly staggered by
some of the dressing. There was a startling
moment when a deep-magenta jersey-silk
stood beside Another in deep mustard tones.
The wearers suddenly shuddered from the
violence of the concussion and fled to the
far ends of the lawn. Mrs. Monty Severn
kept a kindly eye on all the proceedings; and
Mrs. Leonard Dodds, in a blanket-cloth suit,
with the stripes trimming coat and skirt,
and a tiny emerald-green hat, was the smart-
est figure at the A.J.C. party.
John McCormack raised the Voice in fare-
well on behalf of Lewisham Hospital on
Saturday night. And the reason why the
kings of old always had a minstrel or two
was clear as crystal; for when the fountain
of song flashed and sparkled, or fell like
the tinkle of rain upon withered leaves,
world-worn hearts grew young, and lines of
worry were smoothed away. Even that just-
missed winner of the Derby was forgotten.
It was a crowded house that set no bounds
to its enthusiasm, and a John in better voice
than ever singing all the favorite songs of
his season—coming back to bow at least a
dozen times after the double encore at the
close; making “Kathleen Mavourneen” some-
thing to live in the heart; and at the very,
very end singing “Then You’ll Remember
Me.” Lewisham Hospital gains £lBOO from
the concert.
The Surgeon MacCormicks’ dance was the
flutter on Saturday night. Ivilmorey’s wide
verandahs and beautiful gardens glittered
with fairy lights, and the big ballroom was
crowded with Sydney’s younger set, the party
being daughter Alison’s affair.
Captain “Jim” Fairfax left on the Nal-
dera. He is the only son of Mrs. Charlie
Fairfax, who was a Frazer, and when he
writes really serious poetry—as, for example,
an ode to the departing Prince which the
family Herald published—he signs himself
“Griffyth Fairfax.” But his muse is not
always adulatory. Certain verses written
for private circulation in criticism of Syd-
ney Society have stung the subjects to mad-
ness. The Lassetters —father, mother and
son —left on the same luxurious vessel. She
was Elsie Antill, a sister of General Jack,
the Light Horseman who is now commandant
in S. Aus.
Henry Forsyth, who went to Cairo as a
major in the N. S. Wales Remount section
shortly after his handsome wife was drowned
while fishing in M.L., is settling in England.
He has bought a place at East Grinstead,
not far from where the Ewan Frazers
abide. East Grinstead is near Lingfield
Racecourse—-the Moorefield, if not the
Rosehill, of London. When the Frazers
went there the head of the household was
interested in racing. He now confines him-
self to golf. Henry Forsyth, on the other
hand, is still a keen racing man, and one
of the best judges of a horse that ever left
Australia.
The Sacred Heart Church in Mosrnan is
rather off the beaten track for fashionable
weddings, but one evening last week it was
positively dizzy with style when Cecil Blyth,
daughter of the “Elmore” Blyths, of Rich-
mond (Q.), married ex-soldier Walden
Taylor, son of Dr. W. F. Taylor, of Bris-
bane. The milk-white satin bridal dress was
built with a square train that carried dozens
of tiny lace frills and had somehow or other
snared a great golden water-lily in its
meshes. Queensland girl Marjorie Cameron
dressed the part of bridesmaid in pale pink
satin and a large lightweight black hat, and
bride’s little cousins Betty and Billie looked
like bon-bons in pink tulle and silver-tissue
wrappings. Bride’s mother and father enter-
tained at the Wentworth. The Walden Tay-
lors will house the wedding presents in Bris-
bane. .
Dark and sparkling Evaleen Young was
one of the parties to the fashionable marriage-
contract of last week. Evaleen’s father and
mother are the station-owning Youngs whose
little bits of the earth occur at Charleville
(Q.) and Moss Vale. Bridegroom was Eric
Walford Broughton, son of Mrs. Frank
Broughton and nephew of the debonair Les-
lie Walford. Scots’ Church saw the cere-
mony, and Thomas Tait was the little min-
istel-. The wedding-dress, planned on classic
lines, was of rich ivory satin with a golden
train ; and white roses and a cobwebby lace
veil finished the outfit. The three brides-
maids, Doreen Young and Lorna and Doris
Wade, wore yellow, the color of the forsaken ;
but everybody knows the Wade gilds have
diamond half-hoops to guard against that.
The Wentworth held the party, which in-
cluded all younger Sydney.
Some girls don’t waste time. Jessie
Wyper duly became a doctor one day last
week, and next morning there was an
announcement that she had commenced prac-
tice at Lidcombe, in partnership with Dr.
Fitzpatrick. As a matter of fact, they are
to be even more closely associated than that
presently. Father, who has taken his bright
daughter for a post-graduate holiday to the
West, i 6 Thomas Edison’s representative in
these parts.
When George 111. sent out his royal gift
of a bull and a cow to his loyal and other
subjects in Sydney, he didn’t know he was
sowing the seed that the descendants of the
said subjects were
to reap more than a
hundred years later
in Hardy Wilson’s
“Cowpasture Road.”
Soon the cow was
with calf, and the
excitement ran to
fever-heat; everyone
wanted that calf to
be a little cow that
in turn would pro-
duce more cows,
which meant milk
and butter. Imagine
the horror when one
morning the colony
awoke to find the
cow and the bull had
cleared out! Off
went the colony
after them, and found them gravely chewing
the cud in what was afterwards to be known
as the Cow Pasture, between Parramatta
and Camden. Two results followed —the On-
slows settled in this country (what was good
enough for the royal cow was good enough
for them), and the expression “a fair cow”
was bprn as the colonists sweated in their
search for the missing herd. Mr. Wilson’s
“Cowpasture Road,” in the Society of
Artists’ show, is bordered by a design that
resembles the old Greek roll and bead, but
is really made up of “bully” ants, legs out-
stretched, body meeting body, very much as
they were, no doubt, when they joyously bit
the legs of the early cattle-rounders.
There' are lots of other good things of
Hardy Wilson’s in the show, notably “A
Little White Leghorn.” The.artist will tell
you gravely that the rooster’s comb-and-
tail architecture inspired the early Greeks
and Romans to their most graceful forms
of decoration. For the rest Hardy says he
is avoiding success like the Devil; and his
quest at the moment is for an American mil-
lionaire who will build a town according to
a plan that the architect Hardy has drawn,
the middle ti be a market-place, from which
the streets run off each in a line with the
constellation after which it is named. He
thinks the deadest drunk could not fail
to steer his course homeward from such a
datum point.
May Moore did us the photo of this bene-
factor.
Perth saw its prettiest wedding of the sea-
son when Phyllis Moore and Bob Macmillan,
son of the Chief Justice, were made one.
The little bride looked very sweet and
demure ; and the happy bridegroom grinned
all the way down the aisle. There were
four tiny bridesmaids in white silk frocks
to their ankles, with broad ribbon sashes
of dark green, and sprays of fruit blossom.
-\ n d the back of the church was a flutter
of girlhood watching their old schoolmate,
and making mental notes on how to do the
trick themselves.
The tale goes that the hardest-shelled medi-
cal bachelor in Sydney has succumbed to the
ripe charms of a Society widow-woman. Per-
sian carpets have been purchased for a flat
de luxe, and the nuptials will take place in
London. The lady goes first.
Alfred Mellor—he’s a debonair Perth
broker —and ever-popular Celia Ghiloni are
to be married shortly. A house has been pur-
chased in South Perth. Mellor is a dapper
little, black-moustached jolmnie who has
evaded pursuit for years. This will make
Celia’s third venture.
. There’s been a lovely little feud going on
in Sydney on the very subject of “Beautiful
Living” which the Lyceum Club is so an-
xious to introduce to us. The vendetta rages
between a fashionable hattery and the estate
agent on the ground floor. ‘ The lady, who
potters in town decoration, decided to havfi
window boxes; and soon Pitt-street had a
festive corner where crimson geraniums
flaunted their laughter to the sky. The
gentleman on the ground floor complained;
the water from. the boxes dripped down the
front of his office. The hat-queen took no
notice, but went on watering her blooms. But
one day the City Council visited her by
proxy and commanded the removal of the
flower-boxes, and for a few days the man
below was happy. Then ope morning he
went purple with rage, for the boxes were
there, more luxuriant, more glowing than
ever. He rushed into his office and called
up the Town Clerk; and by proxy once more
the frowning City Fathers waited upon
Madame. Madame refused to remove the
window-boxes. “I tell you,” spluttered the
City .Council, “the watering of the flowers is
causing trouble.” Madame struggled and
said: “Come see for yourself.” The City
Council (by proxy) looked and sniffed —and
went away with a lmppy grin. The
geraniums were artificial!
S 7^ ry A body is dr °PP in g a trifle into the
Y.W.C.A. hat, and a very pretty hat it is
when the Bank girls are the wearers. The
Cafs Chantant pitched by the girls in
the Commonwealth dining-room and on the
flat roof was marked by visions of Spring in
paper millinery and by the fine singing of
May Monagan, the Bank’s Melba ; the ukelele
and guitar lent their plaintive sw'eetness to
the programme, and treasurer Miss Mackellar
smiled over the addition handed to the Blue
Triangle.
There’s one girls’ school, at any rate,
which is doing its bit to further art in Aus-
tralia, and it is at Mittagong. Every year
Miss West, the principal, comes down to the
art shows and buys at least one picture
for her school, and every year the girls
(who, by the way, wear a .sensible two-piece
uniform, consisting of a smartly-cut, nut-
brown, knee-length jumper over nut-brown
bloomers) have a dinner and a speech-
making (there is no prize-giving), and pre-
sent the school with yet another work of
art. This year Gruner is commissioned to
turn out one of his best for Frencham.
Principal Miss West is an astonishing per-
son ; as the school thrives she sends first
this and then that teacher travelling for
experience. It is significant that Julian
Ashton's, most promising student of the
moment is an old Frencham girl.
There’s nothing Presbyterian in the color-
ing of the Charley Wheeler paintings that
are decorating Gayfield Shaw’s rooms,
though Charley was born in Dunedin; and
his nudes amid the poplars and at the bath-
ing-pool show that he has more acquaint-
ance with the girl of the -beaches than with
the macintoshed and goloshed woman of
his native city. Blue is a favorite color of
the young man’s; he catches it in “Blue
Shutters” and “The Blue Coat,” and “The
Striped Jacket” is not free of it. “Le
Printemps,” the vivid and yet tender color-
ings of which appealed to ,the Paris Salon;
“Katinka,” an active young person in a
checked apron, which made a strong appeal
to the National Gallery; and “The Washing
Place”—these are among the other attrac-
tions of an arresting little show.
At least one dinner that Longstaff has
eaten in Sydney was of the highest gastro-
nomic order, and that was the one with the
strictly-limited guest-list prepared at the
Mary Elizabeth, with Mrs. Aronson as high-
priestess of the feast. No one who didn’t
represent art to the last degree put feet
under the little brown tables./
Mrs. Alex. Hay, who is in London with
her sister, has been flying, and the other day
they went to Paris and back by aeroplane,
just missing a trip in which the air-mail and
its passengers crashed. Her brother, Beau-
fort Burdekin, who served in the R.F.A.
during the war and married an English girl,
is aboard the Osterley on his way to Sydney,
where he means to practise at the Bar. With
the Burdekins are Seppy Alison and his wife.
He is Jim Alison’s son and was a subaltern
in the Guards during the Mons retreat. The
Germans got him, and he spent the remainder
of the war as a prisoner.
Thea Barclay, who married artist Elder-
sliaw the other day, left last week for Tas-
mania, where she and her color-man are
going to set up home in the old mill-house
that stands at one end of the Richmond
bridge. They will have all the stretch of
the river and the wonderful arche.s of the
bridge to prove that beauty still lives;
and the top-storey of their quaint dwelling
is one long room capable of holding a whole
Society of Artists’ Show.
Mrs. Gordon Weschd is back from her
Queensland visit to Mrs. Willie Collins, who
just missed entertaining the Prince. Never
mind, none of her precious china or crystal
is shattered.
The ball in aid of the Hospice for the
Dying will take place on the 11th at Pad-
dington Town Hall. Sir Walter and Dame
Margaret are to be present, and Owen Cox
will bring beauty from Castle Hill.
This is a May Moore photograph of Clar-
ice Skewes, the clever girl with a wealth of
gold-brown hair who has been running
this year’s show for
the Society of Art-
ists. Miss Skewes,
who started out as a
school-teacher, has a
little art-resting
place of her own—
the Salon of Fine
Art—where many in-
teresting and inti-
mate shows are
brought to a success-
ful climax. This is
the first year the
Society of Artists
has placed its panels
entirely in female
hands, and the sales
are the highest on
record. Clarice is
young and enthusi-
astic, and already one of the art connoisseurs
of Australia.
St. Luke’s Hospital is to benefit by a fete
in the grounds of Redleaf, the W. H. Mackay
home, on Nov. 27. Mrs. Rabett, Mrs. Esmond
Friend and Mrs. Meares are among the
movers.
Justin Vaughan Flynn, a man with a
speaking voice that the seraphim might envy,
has arranged a pot pourri of Aussie poetry,
with a background of music by Australian
composers. Lawson and silvery-voiced Rod
Quinn and David McKee Wright are to
be quoted, with poetesses, too; and composer
Alfred Hill and others will provide the musi-
cal variations. It is timed for October 20.
This (Thursday) evening Lionel Lindsay
will talk and demonstrate how etchings are
made —at the Women Painters’ Club, Queen
Vic. Markets. You can take the whole
course for one shilling.
“Elysian Flats” sounds a pretty promising
address for your best young man to hail
from, and that was the home of one of
last week’s new husbands. But the young
lady’s name shattered some of the celestial
lightness. It was Bulloch.
Theo Marks is a standing temptation to
the criminal classes. Like many big bettors
he feels most comfortable when he has
large sums in ready cash on him; and that
he walks about the city as well as goes
racing so loaded is well known. On Satur-
day a Randwick pickpocket tried to sepa-
rate him from his day’s wad, but bungled
the affair; last year an abler practitioner
engaged him as he was walking home from
a Tatt.’s settling with close on £lOOO in
notes, and got the lot.
Since his return from the war, Eric N.
Birks, advertising manager of the Common-
wealth Bank, has spent more money than
any other ad. man in Australia; he con-
trolled the “boosting” of the First and Second
Peace Loans, and his work has been a big
factor in borrowing £50,000,000. He now
leaves Australia’s tallest money-box with a
flattering collection of souvenirs and fare-
well letters; and another pen will edit the
Bank’s staff magazine.
The Summer Girl can have plenty of
silken hose, real or artificial, no matter
what happens to her little French sister.
And the best of these, plain and ribbed, is
that they are made in Australia. A
stocking-machine, Twist-like, is,always ask-
ing for more. It goes on knitting, knitting;
when it finishes one stocking its steel fingers,
without pausing, start another. After the
machine bows out the finished article the
seam has to be stitched up; then, steaming
from some operation, they are slipped on to
metal legs of different sizes. Every factory
has rows and rows of limbs that stand
impudently with the sole turned towards the
ceiling, and in the distance look like a
panto ballet in full action. These made-in-
Australia stockings are sleekly prosperous-
looking, and will enhance the value of any
tram-stepping calf.

Fingers grown cramped from long disuse
find new skill in the Beale Player Piano.
Old favorites—abandoned for years on
account of technical difficulties —again make
their intellectual appeal. For the Beale
affords infinite capacity for intelligent
interpretation. It provides a perfect tech-
nique in a piano of unusual mellowness
but the actual result rests with you. Yours
is the interpretation—as varied in character
as the number of times you may wish to
play it.
The better musician you are the more you will appreciate the Beale.

G.H.P.: The man who jambs his type-
written lines so close together that the ghost of an
idea can’t poke in between is inviting rejection.
If his stuff is on the border-line it falls into the
basket for certain Phil R.: Threshed that out a
few months ago. .. . Bundalba: Glad to hear; but
the bottle-tree has been pen-pricked to death....
Chick S.: Tuneful stuff, but not up. .. .F.M.C.: Not
much of a yarn, and told with painful lapses of
grammar J.S. (Westport) : Doesn't get to any-
thing except a faint, unmirthtul scent of decay
from the last stanza.... Poppy: Not for u 5....
D.D.F.: Get rid of phrases like “beneath the
Phoebus blast*’... .E.H.D.: Poor, thin verse....
Colwood: That’s the S. M. Herald’S yarn, too. But
it is not true. The supporters of the direct North-
South line don’t “rely chiefly on the mineral wealth
of the Ranges.” They rely chiefly on a bargain
that was made with S. Australia; and, until S.
Australia releases the Commonwealth, that bargain
has either to be kept or the Commonwealth is guilty
of a confidence trick... .Woodjammer: A bit too
obvious. The axe could say a lot more than that.
lster: Doesn’t tell anything... .E.W. (Pros-
pect): Is it a sermon?. .. .Sir Spen: Too thin and
frail... .L.G. (Adelaide): “Solace” misses; and the
others are fearful things of jumps and guesses....
L.N. (Alberton) : Verse not up Jenny H.:
No use to us G.8.D.: “Triolet” hasn’t enough in
it. .. .Juvenisenex: A child shouldn’t die to a loping
measure like that... .Boju River: Not well enough
done... .Viva: We don’t like them. They are merely
small, fantastic fragments of prose. .. .Phyllis H.:
We're sure he can’t dream comfortably to that
tune... .Exul: You could improve that without mak-
ing it a parody Som: Topical verse should do
something more than repeat its text in doubtful
rhyme... .J.J.H.: Sorry; the verse is not nearly
up... . Sparta : One stanza thrills: —
The street was of gold for one night only
For one night only the street was of gold.
I think of it oft when I am lonely
The story of love that his dark eyes told.
The street was so dull and then like magic
The man of my dreams appeared with a smile
That he was married seemed very tragic
So we just forgot for a little while.
. . . .A.G.W. Those “White Horses” have been ridden
so often. .. .R.N.P.: Hang up “Spring at the Home-
stead” for another 10 months and then come again.
... .S.P. (Caulfield) : Really rotten. . . .H.L.T.: “The
Shrew” doesn’t get near. ... Yibanitu: Verse fails in
“Creation” ; thought in “Idyll”; both in “The
Tournament”.... Test Tube: You have an astonish-
ing capacity for capturing the word that jars most
and using it in verse that calls for music E.A.M.;
“Reverie” and “Unaware” haven’t the quality....
Jean S.: The Lord strengthen your sense of humor.
Also of rhythm ! Likewise of rhyme !. .. . Mary M.:
Very poor stuff. .. .Chick S.: Not skill enough....
Geo. C.: Ridiculous. .. .E. 0.: “Question of Responsi-
bility” doesn’t do it.... Wanda Dell: “The Anthem!’
is stumbling verse without much force and with less
song. .. .R.F.S.: “Pure Blood” is the usual attempt
to represent the Australian father as an idiot. Really,
falling over an obstacle isn’t the top note in humor.
J.M.S.Y.; Not our sort F.R.L.: There is not
enough meat in your stew T.P.; “Pictures”
scarcely shout for print N.E.W.: Ah, here’s a pic-
ture of ourselves as “The Critic”:—
’Tis the joy and the relish of my abundant life
To see in your eyes the stare of daisies white
As I dig at your heart with mine own reckless knife
And know no soft thought or contrite.
For I am a king by my pen made bold,
And I’ll take all your lives to stow T in my hold
And subdue you to my sway.
Laugh, staff 1 A spirit’s in decay!
We recognised it at once Artemus H.; “White
Australia” goes too heavily.... Fungus: Eight lines
of commonplace scrawled in pencil and -unpunctuated.
....T. Blue: We begin to suspect Why they call
this season the Spring. It’s because it makes all
the poet’s heads go round Oliver B.: “With the
Jumbucks” has the true flavor:—
TO AUTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
G. 8.: It isn’t good enough, but work 0n... .
H.E.Z.: Close up the vampire factory and get
religion.. .E.L.: The drawing doesn’t exactly sparkle
with interest and the jest is too weak to stand....
Donald G.: That gag had a long innings as the
climax of a mild smoking-room yarn. Your accom-
panying diagram is quite wooden.... Marshall:
Apparently curates were invented to ask foolish
questions at doors drawn by humorous artists....
R.U.: It cannot play here...R.C.: You haven’t skill
enough yet to use a trick method effectively....
V.P.S.H.: The lady of the house is too angular....
E.A.D.: Drink is the only antidote for such art....
T.A.8.: The wife shouldn’t waste time abusing her
drunken husband. She should force the brute to
assist her in abusing the artist who created them
both. .. .M.J.M.: Which of the inane women makes
that irritating remark? Is it the one with the
saveloy curls, or the false-alarm Mona Lisa?
Sarah: We sentence you to six weeks’ scrubbing....
C.E. J.: Send it to Ireland where (so we understand)
people say “Be jabers” constantly. And improve
your drawing. ... H.K.L.: When you send sugges-
tions it isn’t necessary to draw people like rats,
squirrels and partly-melted wax figures V.W.:
She landed on the pavement amid the ruins of her
sacred umbrella... .L.J.D.: Why did you drag that
one out of its tomb?.. . .C.J.0.: Don’t let your brain
explode with such ideas Bell B.: Saddest thing
this week. We hid it hurriedly when closing up for
the evening. If the lady who cleans out sees such
things she has hysterics M.E.: Hardly worth
while sending that from England Rodv S.: Early
stuff.
Hullo, Harry ! When did you get back ?
It’s just three years to-day since we met;
Only just got back off that dirty track.
Let’s go down to old Stone’s for a wet.
Yes ! Two years on the road with those cursed toads.
One would think it would never end !
Our horses to j>ack, and drays to load,
Day and night those woolly-jims to attend.
’Twas not all fun, nor as easy as carrying a gun.
Long before morn before break of dawn —
Rush 0! as sure as the morning sun.
A stampede; and away they had gone.
Now it’s not all over, for good old Dan and Rover,
They had their work cut out;
We’ll settle that curly-horned joker,
To-morrow he’s lights goes out.
.. . .Hugh G. G.: Nothing in them.’

The Mother of this Sturdy
Young Rexona Boy writes:—
I have been using Rexona Soap on my
little boy Ronald’s hair ever since his birth,
and he is now two years old. lam simply
delighted, how lovely Rexona Soap has
made his hair. I have seven children, and
the hair of all the othe-s is straight.
Ronald’s hair is so soft and fluffy and curly
that all the neighbors ask me what I do to
make it so. I simply tell them, I wash it
with Rexona Soap.
There is nothing like Rexona Soap, I think.
I tell my friends to try it too, and they will
soon think as I do. I am sending you a
picture of Ronald, for he is a real Rexona
boy, and simply loves Rexona Soap.
Yours truly,
(Mrs.) ALICE EPPLESTON,
First Avenue,
Eastwood, N.S.W.
Rexona Soap for the
Hair and Scalp.
&
;
Little
RONALD
EPPLESTON,
aged, two years
(from a photo).
The hair falls naturally at the change of the seasons or after an illness, and If
new hair does not appear in sufficient quantity, if the scalp is irritable, or there is
dandruff, you want a hair tonic. Try this, and you will join the army of those who
thank Rexona for their beautiful hair. With the finger-tips rub well into the scalp
a small quantity of Rexona Ointment. It destroys dandruff, loosens particles of
adhering dust, and cleanses the scalp. A few hours later, thoroughly wash the hair
with warm water and Rexona Soap, a medicated shampoo and complexion soap of
absolute purity.
GET THE REXONA HABIT.
The Rexona habit results in health and beauty, and once formed will never be
broken. ...
There are two Rexona habits —that of using Rexona Ointment to heal all injuries
to the skin, and the Rexona Soap habit, which consists of keeping oneself clean and
pure with a delicately-scented and medicated soap. Rexona Ointment and Rexona Soap
mean skin health and beauty, comfort to the user, and
immunity from disease. So form the Rexona Habit. Start
with a 1/- cake of Rexona Soap and a 1/6 pot of Ointment.

Storm.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHl’f'E tops at sea, and in the sky
A routed cloud battalion!
Storm rides the landscape, raging by
Upon his loose-maned stallion.
The h.vA'ied leaves uplifted go
Like flurried swifts and swallows:
The wiftq is shouting “Tally-ho!”
Across the hills and hollows.
The suit on e stabbing ray of light
eastward, red and level,
Then and leaves the world to night,
To ri°t, tage and revel;
O’er lath) ahd sea, o’er foam and fret,
Gloon 1 drops its hiding tresses,
And lights gleam pale, like lights far set
In lotH, Dst Wildernesses.
From cisterns of the sky set free
Dowd pours the stinging rain ;
Hurt, harried, stung to ra.ge, the sea
Roarß lik e a* beast in pain;
High rearing, with a gale behind,
Fierce breakers gallop forward ;
Like before the scathing wind
The ffiiindrift races shoreward.
On timßUj-ed ridges, black and lone,
In gu'lieS choked with gloom,
Wrenched trunks and writhing branches
g r nan
In tef]Se, fierce grips with doom ;
O’er rock-sti’cwn beds, long dry and dumb,
Foam-'flakod the torrent rages;
Here fa'lg a pine, and thex*e a gum
A migfbty combat wages.
As wher 1 before a pack of hounds
A woH in panic flies,
The fordNt to its heart resounds
With bowls a nd hunting-cries;
Gulf stnOfits to gulf and steep to steep,
The f“ty Splits, lightning-riven;
To-nighf; to folk who fain would sleep
No stß'leSS rest is given.
White tJ'ps nt sea, and in the sky

Upon Ifis loose-maned stallion.
By beach and c Hff, on plain and range,

"The Honorable Rags.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Raoul Jean-Baptiste Marie
Wfldetin turned the corner into
Kn'heS-street; his upright figure’s
dignity *fid flot tell of an empty stomach,
and his haggard eyes had nothing to say as
he took *Us daily way to the docks.
“Tm? ’That’s oie Rags.” Spiky Stott
turned oh his post to spit behind Cliff’s back,
Cliff bei fl g the recipient of what little polite-

about tl>h ’Roo a long time now.”
“’E’s hot flash, Spike; but why ‘Rags’?”
“Well* ’e’s a bit barmey, ole Rags is.”
Spiky sfhjke apparently in confidence. “One
of them Bdgintns wot got it in the neck
while tPb Wnr Was on. ’E’s lookin’ for a
Digger W>ij 0 told ’im in France ’e was the
Honorable Rags, of Woolloomooloo, Syd-
ney.” ’’tpiKy took the straw out of his
mouth HDit again, presumably in deri-
sion. “Roth of ’em must ha’ bin barmey,”
he said, with Bo evidence yet to hand in
support hf his statement. One o’clock rang
from sR Mary’s and Spiky slipped off
his posß “The kids and what-not about
’ere calf ’iih Bags ’cos for one thing they
can’t sfhV ’is fiame, and for another ’e’s

find the Honorable Bags, of Woolloomooloo,

dinner-tj*he’!s up; I got to go back to Pebble’s.
Shall I hee ye l to-night?”
“No, hot to-night, kid ; I got business to

Cliff’s expressed a momentary disap-
pointment ant of proportion to its cause,
but he quickly.
“RigbW), fk>me other time. So long.” The
red heafi disappeared jauntily round the

CliffoCl iJijphles stood for a moment, won-
dering •‘J'hat faint chord of memory the

in the fhidday streets; the shuttered houses
drowsed in ditty content while the wistaria
c lipobed hp th e ty faces and looked into the
windows at the struggles for rest, the peace
of the unfit in the refuge of the ’Loo.
Crossing Cliff’s vision and the tram-lines
“ole Rags” was making a graceful cere-
mony of getting from the docks to the gate
of the Domain. Cliff’s sentimentalities fell
from him—the Honorable Rags—the Honor-
able Rags—where had he heard the name?
Watching, he saw the old man stumble
and fall; he had struggled .to his feet again
when Cliff reached him.
“Merci, merci bien, monsieur.” A thin voice
trailed down to nothing as Cliff helped him
to a seat. The tired old face was grey and
pinched ; black lines were heavy under the
faded eyes; M. Poquetin’s hands shook as
they rested on Cliff’s arm. Cliff looked at
him sharply as he put him into the seat.
He had seen a number of men in varying
troubles, in and out of quod, and “ole
Rags’s” trouble stuck out a foot. “My God!”
he muttered, “the poor old ’s all in—-
’asn’t ’ad a feed for a week.”
“Feelin’ better?” Cliff said after a while.
“Oh, yes, I am better now. I thank you.
You are most kind to help a stranger.”
Cliff said nothing. “O Hell!” would have
fitted any other case, but this old bird with
his queer accent somehow made “O Hell!”
seem hopelessly out of place; so Cliff said
nothing.
“You do not by any chance, sir, know
where I may find the Honorable Rags, of
Woolloomooloo, Sydney?” “Ole Rags”
spoke in his former tired voice with an
added pathetic tremor which penetrated even
the hardened ear of Cliff.
“No, I dunno where you’d find ’im —I’ve
’eard the name somewhere, but where and
’ow I can’t remember.”
A gleam of hope shone in M. Poquetin’s
eyes. No one else had even heard the name
—no one else after the first day or .so had
done more than laugh at the question. He
turned to Cliff, indefinable, unbreakable
courtesy in his eagerness.
“You know the name, sir? Will you for-
give me if I tell you the story? It is long
—I regret very much your valuable time —
but I have been so long seeking him, so
long”
“Fire away; I got time to burn.”
“Thank you, sir. I met Monsieur Rags
at Fontainelieu, where my grand-daughter
and myself found refuge at last. In the
second bombardment my house at Givet was
destroyed, my wife and daughter were killed,
and only my grand-daughter and I were
left—the old man and Marie-Julie.” M.
Poquetin’s eyes left Cliff’s face and stared
out over the tumbled houses, the docks, the
harbor and the wide seas.
“Well?” Cliff said at last.
Poquetin sighed and came back to to-
day. “My son had died at Namur, and for
me there was nothing left in the world, save
Marie-Julie.” A quick hand measured three
feet from the grass. “That, then, is the
picture, sir; an old professor of languages
and his grand-daughter at the house of
Madame Leduc in Fontainelieu. Here Mon-
sieur Rags comes and is billeted; he and
Marie-Julie, who is ill, become fast friends.
Lie is big,” the hand shot up to the full
height of its reach, “and brown and merry.
Every night he has a story for the child.
She must get better that he may take her
to his father’s estate of Woolloomooloo in
Sydney, where he is of the title ‘Honorable,’
his father being a lord.”
Cliff shifted uneasily on the bench. In
animation the old bird’s eyes lost their
fadedness and burned most uncomfortably;
he was more than “a bit barmey,” in Cliff’s
opinion.
“He becomes to me my own son. After
all that I had passed through, sir, at the
end of my life—all the horror and blood, the
nameless degradation of the things which had
been holy to us until then, all the infamies
which cannot be believed that I could tell
you—when I am at the end of my endurance,
there is the child and myself 0n1y... .and to
us comes Monsieur Rags, big and laughing,
saying that Marie-Julie must get well soon
and come to see the waratahs in his father’s
garden at Woolloomooloo.”
Poquetin’s voice fell a tone, his haggard
eyes still resting on Cliff’s face. Hysteria
had risen in the rush of his story, and Cliff
saw the reason of his continued chase. He
could have seen through Rags’s yarn in one
day if he had been himself; but he was not
himself —he was an old man seeking the only
reality left in his world of shadows.
“So when my friend Doctor Malprat says
that only strong sunshine can save the child’s
life (if it be God's will that it be saved) I
bring her here to the address of Monsieur
Rags. And I seek and seek, until all the
little money I had is gone; but I cannot find
him.... And now Doctor O’Grady says that
Marie-Julie can live perhaps only a week- —
the sunshine was too late.... Soon the old
man will be quite alone”
Worn out by hunger and hopelessness the
debonair control gave way; the quick hands
covered the haggard eyes, and the man wept.
Cliff sat beside him looking and feeling like
nothing on earth.
Presently Poquetin looked up. “Forgive
me, sir,” he said, as he rose unsteadily. Cliff
got up, too, with relief; here was something
tangible to do.
“ ’Ere, I’ll ’elp you ’ome; ye’re all in.”
“Thank you. It is not far to Brazier-
street, but I should be glad to know there
was somebody with me.”
At the door he glanced in deprecation at
Cliff. “Will you come in and see the child,
sir? Her distractions gre few.” Cliff
wanted beer —the last hour had been a
week’s work in effort —but he followed in
and up the stairs.
Coming down the stairs again and out into
the street the picture of the hungry old man
on a hopeless quest with the half-dying child
was in his mind to stay longer than most
things stayed there. It was so hope-
less and there wasn’t anything a bloke
could do. The £1 note ha had managed to
slip under the kid’s counterpane would do
the feed business, but what was the good
of that? It wasn’t tucker they wanted; it
was Rags and the house in the garden -where
the kid’s waratahs would be. Damn the
Honorable Rags ! It was on Cliff’s nerves;
there was no way out anywhere. In Ryan’s
parlor the Beak nodded to him and bought
his beer for him. Sociability was not Cliff’s

WORRIES BRING ACHES
Life to-day brings many worries, and worrying is apt to bring on kidney
troubles, so the medical men say.
It’s easy, of course, to say, “Don’t worry,” but it can’t be helped when
things go wrong constantly. However, make it a rule never to worry over
trifles, and, when there is reason to suspect kidney weakness, help the
kidneys before anything more serious can happen.
Kidney weakness usually shows itself in backache, pains when stooping or
lifting, or lameness in the morning, headache, dizzy spells and urinary
disorders.
To strengthen weak kidneys, use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. This is a
reliable, safe remedy that acts on the kidneys only. It can’t hurt sound
kidneys, and it does help sick kidneys. SYDNEY people say so. Two
interesting cases are published here.
SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
LASTING CURE OF THREE YEARS.
Mrs. A. Hughes, 68 Angel Street, Newtown,
Sydney, says:—“My husband says he is convinced
that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills stand ahead of
any kidney remedy he knows of, and he speaks from
experience. For a long time he was troubled with
nagging pains across the small of his back, and they
often nearly crippled him, as he could not stoop
or turn without suffering positive agony. He
took remedies of all kinds, but it was left to
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills to effect a cure.
This medicine acted on the kidneys very quickly,
giving him relief in a day or so, and eventuallv
curing him completely. They not only drove the
ache from his back, but strengthened and toned up
his kidneys so thoroughly that he has had no
return of the complaint since, a period of over
three years. His general health also improved
very much.”
CURED SEVEN YEARS AGO
AND STILL WELL.
Mr. Lewis Williams, 602 Botany Road, Botany,
Sydney, says : —“I was a great sufferer with my back,
and the pain was at times so bad that -I have had to
leave my work and go home. I also had to walk
about in a bent position, and could not straighten
without increased suffering. I used various
preparations, but only got slight relief. Reading
of cures effected by Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
I decided to try them. One bottle eased the pain
and the second completed my cure. This did not
happen yesterday, but about seven years ago, and
I have had no sign of backache all that time, so it
is not mere temporary relief, but a perfect cure.
I am always advising my friends to use Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, and take this opportunity
to publicly recommend them.”

long suit.at any time, but te-day, with that
old bloke and the wasted, feverish kid fresh
in his memory, the Beak did all the talking.
His yarn drifted in and out of Cliff’s ears
without making any impression. The kid,
: all eyes; and that poor old
“What’s that? Who did yer say?”
The Beak had been at Ryan’s all day and
he was hurt with Cliff. “Wot I’ve bin
talkin’ about all this while, Cliff; you ain’t
bin listenin’ to me. Alec Nillson’s over from
Melbourne layin’ low over the Communal
Bank clean-up last week”
Cliff put his glass down; his eyes got the
icy-hard look of Cliff at work. Alec Nill-
son—why couldn’t he have remembered it
before? “Where is he, Beak?”
“Over at old Nell’s” Cliff had gone,
leaving the Beak very hurt with him.
Cliff knocked at the familiar Abercrombie-
street door, and old Nell opened it. He
entered without speaking. In the back
room Alec was lying on the bed smoking a
cigarette. He looked up as Cliff came in.
“Hullo, Cliff.”
Cliff got to business at once.
“ ’Member that Digger cobber of yours who
was screwed in Ryan’s one night, Alec, and
kept callin’ you the Honorable Rags?”
Alec grinned. “Yes, what about it?”
“ ’Member the old Frencliie and ’is kid at
Fontinloo ?”
Alec’s grin faded. “Yes. What about.
them f”
“They’ve bin lookin’ for you in yer father’s
estate of Woolloomooloo, Sydney, this past
three weeks.”
Alec slipped off the bed and came over to
Cliff.
“Cough it up. Cliff; what do you know?”
“What I tell yer. They’re down in
Brazier-street now; I’ve just left ’em. The
old man’s ’ungry and the kid’s damn near
dyin’.”
Alec looked out of the window into the
slush and filth of Abererombie-street. It
was a hard life; ups and downs —plenty of
downs—and not many clean places anywhere.
Poor little kid
“The ’Loo’s no good to me, Cliff. I’m
pinched for a certainty if I put me nose out
of Nell’s door for a month yet. But”
Alec walked back to the bed and sat down.
Cliff waited, but the Honorable Rags sat
staring at his boots in silence.
“Well, there it is ; 112 Brazier-street will
find ’em—at the docks end of yer father’s
park.” Cliff turned at the door, but Alec
didn’t look up.
* * * *
In the afternoon a party of three made
their way into the main entrance of the
Botanic Gardens. The child, leaning so
heavily on the arm of the tall young man and
the upright old one, made the slow pace.
Poquetin’s face was less haggard ; into the
faded eyes a calmer look had come ; here
surely, stretched in terraced beauty to the
grey battleship in the quiet water, was the
confirmation of his faith in his friend. This
was the park of the lord who was Rags’s
father, open for the people in the springtime
of the year. The old man looked at Marie-
Julie, her great eyes fixed steadily and
happily on Rags showing her the hidden
corners of his ancestral garden. In spite
of the miraculous appearance of Rags,
Poquetin’s heart was heavy; Doctor O’Grady
had said that there was no possible hope; it
could not be for long now.
“But where is my ’ouse you promise me,
Rags?”
Rags pointed to some men at work behind
the dark hollow 7 where the palms whispered
to the doves. “It’s not fixed up yet, Marie-
Julie. The men are making the Blue Bedroom
for you where the birds with violin-tails sit
on the window-sills.”
“Oh, Rags, ’ow lovely! Soon it will be
done for me?”
“Yes, very soon now.” Rags was seeing it
through. Every shadow 7 was a plain-clothes
man with five years’ hard in his pocket, but
Rags was seeing it through; he’d make a go
of these few hours for the kid if he could.
“And all the room will be blue, Rags, with
red only where the waratah fairies’ caps
shall be?”
“But there will be gold where the violin
bird sings, Marie-Julie; don’t forget that.”
“No, I will not forget. Let us come and
live ’ere soon, Rags.”
“As soon as the men are ready for us,
Marie-Julie, w'e’ll move in; we’ll, have a
great party and invite all the children in
the world to come to see Marie-Julie’s new
home where the fairies are on guard.”
TJp and down the paths the three went
in the sound of the dove’s voices, between
the walls of color and through the w'aves of
perfume. No garden in the world was ever
like this ; no patch of earth under the sky
fulfilled its duty as this sloping glory of
Rags’s father’s. Marie-Julie sighed in con-
tent ; it was the good time past come back
again, she thought, her eyes on Rags’s face.
Poquetin gave thanks as they reached the
Brazier-street door, where the sun was red
behind the huddled houses ; in the end God
had been good. Rags carried Marie-Julie
upstairs, and got away as soon as he could ;
the luck looked like holding, after all. As
he came out of the gate Sergeant Mdnstry
met him.
“Wliat made you break cover. Alec?” he
asked, as Constable O’Gorman joined them
at the corner.
“A cobber of mine in trouble. Mac, and
nearly dyin’,” replied the Honorable Rags.
Going up the steps of the Domain station,
a vagrant thought of Marie-Julie’s house
flitted into Rags’s mind. Well, she wouldn’t
be waiting long for it, he decided. What was
the chaplain's gag? “In my Father’s house
there are many mansions”....
FRANCIS BRIEN.
Was Benton Guilty?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
fTI HAT night when Benton slipped into
bed his wife was already asleep. He
had had a trying day and was over-
wrought. Always a busy man, business
worries had come thick and fast to put an
extra strain upon him. Besides, he had
caught a passing glimpse of Morton, his old
enemy. What could Morton be doing here?
Had he seen Benton? Was he aware that
Benton lived in the town and was a pros-
perous business man, holding the office of
v ... % ■ .
coroner and other positions of importance?
Yet none knew of the great hate that had
started 20 years ago. They had quarrelled
fiercely, savagely then. Morton had won the

would know. The thought lulled him to
sleep.

Benton’s enemy proved to be stronger
~.•,,, , , . . ,
than he anticipated, and wrench and twist
as he might, he somehow failed to get the
mastery. But they were nearer the edge,
Not a sound was heard except their panting
as they gripped and wrestled—the one to
hurl his enemy into the slimy depths of the
shaft; the other to prevent it.
Suddenly a cold fear entered Benton s
heart, llis strength seemed to be waning,
He felt that Morton, instead ot resisting
only, was now actually endeavoring to hurl
him Benton into the shaft. To think
that in the hour of his triumph he should

that slimy hole. No, he would triumph
over his enemy. Bracing himself for one
final effort—they were right on the edge
now—he placed his foot firmly to gain pur-
chase and heaved with, all his might, and —
the crumbling edge gave way. Morton add-
ing a final thrust, Benton was hurled into
the shaft. His body struck the rotting tim-
bers at the bottom and he lay broken, nartly
submerged in the slimy ooze and mud.
Before consciousness deserted him, he
heard the sound of his enemy’s retreating
footsteps

Benton was awakened by the sharp
sounds of his wife’s voice. “Whatever are
you doing? You’ve turned and twisted all
night, and now you’re on the floor. For
goodness sake get back into bed and keep
quiet.” "
Trembling and shaken by his dream, he
slowly arose and got back into bed. So it

Morton and then—well, he would see.

. . , , „ , ,
At breakfast Benton’s nerves, already
shaken, were thoroughly unstrung by a mes-
sage from the police that early that rnorn-
ing the body of a man had been recovered
from the old shaft, and that an inquest would
be bold tbe afternoon. Two boys return-
ing to town late that night had, according
to t j le p o jj ce report, seen a man standing
no t far from the shaft, who had approached
it as if for a closer examination. Then
when they arrived opposite the place they

fallen into the shaft. Being alarmed, they
fl ed and sa j d nothing of the occurrence
till early next morning, when the police
recovered the body. It was tflat of a stranger
an< - unidentified.
Benton heard the news and stood as if
Whose was the body ? Would it
prove to be, Mortons? Was that really a
dream, or had he thrown Merton into the
shaft? No, certainly, it had been a dream,
But he had intended it to be a reality. His
brain was in a whirl, The inquest would,
however, clear it all up, and he was the
coroner and would give the verdict, after all
He knew it was Morton—he was sure of
it In hig dream the struggle occurred at
.midnight. His wife had awakened him at
midnight. The boys asserted that the tra-
gedy occurred at midnight. Yes, it was Mor-
ton all right; but what could have led him

Benton, was there in his dream? Was it
re ally an accident, or had some terrible
agency impelled Morton unconsciously to
death ’>
Benton'was right. The inquest proved
beyond a doubt that Morton was the victim,
