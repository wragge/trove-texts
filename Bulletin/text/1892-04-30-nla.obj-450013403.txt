for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and w-rito to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. Ho will
on receipt of such a letter, wu-ite you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters arc carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their eases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 26,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. AU

AND
Special Diseases
Of Men and Women in the leading Medical Schools and

Kkt,s ;dical man advertising in these colonies has medical
degrees which can be compared with his. Such eminent
qualifications, together with his recognised straightfor-
ward treatment, has naturally gained for him the reputa-
tion of being the
ONLY LEGALLY QUALIFIED DOCTOR

Knowledge Honest Treatment, as may easily be ascer-
tained by applying to any leading paper in the colony.
No diseases cause so much misery and distress as those
included in my speciality.
All Men Young and Old,
Suffering from the results of early follies or ex*
cesses, indigestion, foul mouth, costiveness, palpi-
tation, singing and pains in the ears and head,
specks before the eyes, giddiness, weakened
memory, pains in the back and chest, varicocele,
diseases of the bladder, kidneys, or liver, rheuma-
tism,impure blood, weakening discharges, impaired
vigor,sterility, premature decay,stricture, nervous-
ness, groundless fears, bashfulness, lassitude, and
NERVOUS DEBILITY, should lose no time in
consulting him, since he has, by long experience
and thorough investigation of their nature, dis-
covered the safest treatment for their permanent
cure. Persons residing at a distance may be treated
at their own homes, without any interruption to
their business, by giving a full and clear descrip-
tion of their symptoms, and the necessary medi-
cines will be forwarded to them. On receipt of
2s. 6d. he will forward his book on the “Male
Generative Function in Health and Disease,”

SATURDAY, APRIL 30, 1892.
Organised Monopoly.
A year ago a great chance came to the
Labour-party of New South Wales, and
partly through ill-fortune, but chiefly through
wonderful mismanagement, internal dis-
sensions, and a deep-rooted conviction on
the part of sundry inflated leaders of the
movement that they owned the earth, it was
fooled away. For almost the first time in
history Labour was organised and ready for
the fray, and Monopoly was unready and
disorganised. The latter accident was one
that was hardly likely to occur again for at
least a generation, for Monopoly, with its
plural votes, its command of newspapers and
money, and its other advantages, is seldom
to be taken unawares. And having found
its enemy asleep, the Labour members—or
rather a few bounceable spirits among them—
deliberately woke it up before they wore
ready for its awakening. They assumed a
rampant, go-to-blazes attitude which roused
every slumberous fossil in the Upper House
to a knowledge of the dangers of the situa-
tiou, and, though numbering less than 40
members in an Assembly of 141, deliberately
and needlessly threatened to wipe their feet
on both the dominant factions. Also they
tried to accomplish everything at once, and
in their haste accomplished nothing at all.
They wrecked the original One-man-one-
vote Bill through quarrelling with the
Parke.s Cabinet over the Coal Mines Bill
while the first measure was still unfinished,
They wrecked the Coal Mines Bill and lost
the chance of getting the Eight-Hour
principle enforced bylaw through demand-
ing a Seven-and-a-half Hour principle
before even the Eight Hours was
secured. They ruined every chance
of getting the second One-man-one-vote
measure through the Upper House by
allowing the wire-pullers of the party to
inform the senile landlords of that solemn
Chamber that they meant to use their new
power for the destruction of landlordism and
the establishment of Single-tax principles.
Not only did they divide the skin while the
bear was still alive, but they divided it so
uproariously that they awoke the bear at
the very beginning of the proceedings.
T * # *
Cp f° date, as already mentioned, the
Labour members in N.S. Wales have gained
absolutely nothing. But they have said
much and, what is worse, they said it all at
once ; and Capital, having been duly in-
formed of all that will come unless it takes
measures in its own defence, and having
been also informed of much that possibly
never will come at all, is organising as it has
never organised before. The premature
vociferation of the New South Wales Labour
Party has done a great deal to wipe out all
immediate hope of forming a similar party
either in Queensland or in Victoria. And,
unless t'ae One-man-one-vote Bill can be
made law before the next election takes
place, the chances are that the Labour
element in the New South Wales Legislature
will itself vanish, to a great extent,
and things will go back to almost
the same position which they occupied when
the Third-party was still unborn. When
that Labour-party allowed itself to become
an advertisement for the Single-tax faction,
it made too many enemies simultaneously.
It issued a challenge to everybody to come
on at once, and the results were ruinous.
# # *
At the general election which took place
in Victoria, on the 20th instant, Labour
put forth its utmost efforts, and, as a jesult,
it secured only eleven seats. The One-
man-one-vote principle —which was accepted
unanimously in New South Wales on that
occasion when the great brick-and-mortar
interest was taken so completely by surprise—
is represented in the Victorian Assembly by a
reliable majority of only live. If the Govern-
ment party keeps faithful to the last man—
if they are all impervious to bribery or influ-
ence in any shape, and not one can be
bought over by the National Association or
its agents—if the measure is not stonewalled
into oblivion, or wrecked in a midnight
division taken by surprise, then it may
possibly get through the Lower House, and
that is all. In the Upper House it has not
one friend and never will have one. A new
Upper House cannot be obtained for six
years, and when it is obtained it will be
equally hostile, for the property suffrage
makes it absolutely impossible for a real
Democrat ever to be returned to the Vic-
torian Council. An Assembly that was
practically unanimous might possibly, by
moral pressure, force some concessions from
that reactionary body, but a mere majority
of five is powerless to do so. And in the
next Parliament, if the forces of Capital
continue as well-organised as at present, the
majority may be considerably less than five.
It has already diminished, and by the further
operation of the same causes, it may easily
keep on diminishing. As for Queensland,
the “Patriotic” League, the Northern
slave-drivers, the pastoralists, the Brisbane
merchants, the banks, and the snufflebusting
party of which Samuel Griffith is the chief
own the land and all that is therein. The
next Parliament, in all probability, will con-
sist of two parties only—the combined
forces of the present Government and
Opposition, united in the common joy of
once more possessing the liberty to wallop
their own nigger ; and a small democratic
section, too much attenuated by roll-stuffing
and the vigorous faking of the election
returns to be of much account.
• » •
The practical extinction of the Labour-
vote by an utterly unscrupulous manipula-
tion of the electoral lists is the policy which
organised capital is pursuing all over the
three provinces. The process is nearly com-
pleted in Qeensland ; it is well-advanced in
Victoria; and in New South Wales it is
making a good and promising beginning.
The agents of the “ National ” Association
or the “Patriotic” League lodge a formal
objection against the name of every working-
man who is known or suspected to possess
democratic tendencies. It is unnecessary to
find any valid or plausible reason for
such objection ; in fact, the Association
can get on better without reasons.
The Association’s lawyer looks after the
case, and the Association’s agent is there to
help him, and the Association’s witnesses
if any are needed— are on hand. The other
party to the transaction has no lawyer ;
there is no organisation to furnish one, and
no money to pay him. The Court sits only
during the day—whereas, its hours of busi-
ness should be from 8 p.m. till midnight, in
order to give the workman a chance to
appear on his own behalf—therefore, the
voter has to lose a day’s employment
and a day’s wages in order to attend.
If the Court is overwhelmed with business,
through the National Association having
objected to an entire township in one lot, he
may have to lose several days’ wages before
his case is called. He has, in most instances,
to ask leave of absence from his employer—
who also generally belongs to the National
Association—before he can appear at all, and
that individual may intimate in a roundabout
w r ay that if he absents himself it will be at
terated from the roll. This process has
the cost of his situation. Therefore, in thou-
sands of cases he doesn’t appear at all, and the
Association triumphantly gets his name obli-
more than decimated the democratic vote
in Queensland ; it has greatly reduced it in
Victoria ; and it is now being applied in
New South Wales to undermine both the
Labour and the Protectionist parties, with a
view to the election which is now only two
years distant,
* m *
And, in addition to all this, the electoral
rolls are being systematically filled with
the names of reliable plural voters in
the good cause of bricks and mortar
and the Golden Calf ; democratic legis-
lators are being bought, most of them
at a cheap rate as job lots of damaged poli-
ticians ; influence—that species of influence
that is exercise! through the advertising
columns—is brought to bear on the press ;
and the Church—with a view to the col-
lection—is made to snuffle humbly in the
interests of monopoly. The great propa-
ganda is based on the double foundation of
money and shameless fraud, and on the other
side there is no propaganda, no money, and
no available fraud worth mentioning. The
party of Property is, for once, unanimous ;
the party of Progress, so far as New South
Wales is concerned, split up at the very
beginning, because it could not decide
whether it should rise in the majesty of its
thirty-seven votes, and abolish Protection
and landlordism right off, or not! The one
party has appointed leaders, and follows
them religiously ; the other, in its political
capacity, consists of thirty-seven leaders and
no followers. The one works in secret,
while the other delivers lectures about its
projects, and gives them away to all who
care to hear. And, above all things, in all
the three provinces of Eastern Australia,
Democracy depends entirely on that branch
of the Legislature which is fleeting and
transitory, while Monopoly has a perpetual
lien on the branch whose bigotry is un-
changeable. In Queensland and New South
Wales the Council is protected by the nomi-
nee principle, and the nominee principle is
backed up by an imported Tory official from
England. In Victoria it is protected by a
property suffrage, which makes it exclusively
the representative of Capital. The mono-
polist party, so long as political power is a
saleable commodity, has an equal chance
with its opponents to secure control of the
popular Chamber ; as for the Upper House,
it belongs body and soul to the Conservative
interest. The situation may be summed
up in a sentence. A year ago the Labour-
party of New South Wales found its
hereditary enemy unprepared, and won
an altogether unlooked-for victory. Since
then, Capital has organised itself so
effectually, that the corresponding parties
in Victoria and Queensland have been
practically extinguished before they had
fairly begun to exist. The Labour-party in
New South Wales, despite its success at the
polls, has accomplished nothing, and it is at
least one of the possibilities of the future
that it will continue to accomplish nothing
throughout the period of the present Parlia-
ment, and that in the next Parliament it may
be politically non-existent. The Labour parties
in Queensland and Victoria, can accomplish
nothing for the present, and the future is a
mystery. And even if the democracy should
get a strong hold upon all three Legislatures,
in each case the Upper House blocks the
way ; it cannot be legally reformed without
its own consent, and it cannot be made to
consent by any legal process whatsoever.
* * *
Yet, despite all these advantages, the
great capitalistic organisation is only a tem-
porary and ephemeral institution. For the
time being the signs are that it will get com-
mand of the Assemblies of the three pro-
vinces by dint of fraud, and bribery, and the
manipulation of the electoral-lists ; it already
owns the other half of the Legislatures ; it
practically owns the Governor, whose veto is
a tower of strength in an emergency ; and it
has a lieu upon the British sovereign, who
is the final court of appeal,- But it is only
piling its money-bags on the safety-valve of
the already overloaded boiler. The last
resource of all is brute force, and bricks and
mortar cannot fight, neither can a bank-
balance get itself up in armour and do any
genuine service in the day of trouble. But
that force will ever be actually called
into requisition we do not for a moment
believe. Some day, if the National Associa-
tion prospers long enough, there will arise
the first faint rumours of insurrection, and
straightway the capitalistic organisation will
dissolve away, and the Chamber of Fossils
will suspend its standing orders in its haste
to pass a Bill for its own abolition, and
there will be a great and general collapse.
The party of the large stomach and the pro-
tuberant white waistcoat has no capacity for
any violence except such as can be done on
paper. The new capitalistic organisation in
Australia is modelled upon that of the Tory
party in Great Britain. But it utterly fails
to realise that the English Tory party lives
entirely upon the support of the army and
»avy.
Imported Cheap “Literature.”
It is a noticeable fact that nobody in Australia
has ever yet issued a magazine or review which
has not perished in short order, or which is not
obviously going to perish at an early date.
Nobody has ever made a fortune out of maga-
zine literature in this country ; nobody has ever
made a decent livelihood out of it; and almost
everybody—it is difficult to recall even one
exception to the rule—who has dabbled in this
fatal branch of print has come to utter ruin and
financial destruction. No single individual has
ever founded a purely comic journal in these
provinces who has not smashed in the process
of endeavouring to supply amusement to the
public. Some of them have smashed in a small
way, and some have smashed badly, but they
have all broken up with unfailing regularity.
No purely literary or artistic journal, either,
has ever survived for any length of time in this
continent. And—apart from The Bulletin,
which was founded when the great inroad of
cheap, imported, British, slop-made alleged
literature was still hardly begun—no paper of
any kind which did not depend entirely on
local murders, politics, drainage items, em-
bezzlements, and wool reports—the one 1
criplion of printed matter which cannot by ° S "
possibility be imported—has ever made '
real success in these parts. The
daily papers and their attendant weeklies 1 * ail
enjoyed the same chances of prosperity as u' Ue
of any other part of the globe, for the sulli- ° Ee
reason that the public must buy them in
to satisfy its yearning for information a bo ,
the gang which smashed the corner hotel' ■ i
the row in the local council, and the md'
mentary stonewall, and the skeleton which ] la '
recently been found in a paddock, and
woman whose throat was cut in a dark str> i
this information being a purely local mononol ’
But in every other branch of print, the t
deucy of the Australian is to buy the cheap a eU ]
nasty British publication, and the toolbar 1
person who endeavours to create a distinctly V
Australian literature gets “ left.” c v
# # #
We have no idea of including literature of
purely English character in this condemnation 3
The British dailies, a large number of Briti 1
magazines, and such weeklies as the (Jrattit
the Illustrated London News, Truth +l°’
World, or even, in a certain measure* t/ 6
artistic but sad and melancholy Punch, fill ?
place—for anyone who craves after British j. a
formation—which no Australian print coun
fill. But beyond these lies the great mass of
small, mean, stupid and incurably wretche 1
publications, whose dreary masses of p r j, t
belong to no particular place or date, and which
are shipped off in bales to any part of the
world where cheapness and ghastly stupidity
will command a market. They are trot upiu^
Bind where paper and type-setting' are both
inexpensive, and unless the Australian paper-
maker, and the Australian compositor,' and
artist, and engraver, and all the casual em-
ployes of a newspaper-office get down to the
British standard of wages, competition is prac-
tically hopeless. Their literary matter is, as a
rule, almost entirely stolen ; the stealing of
literary matter and the stealing of boots 8 or
clothes off a line, or the thieving of horses
out of a paddock, are equally immoral
but the law permits this kind of larcencV
and no publication which endeavours to pay
a fair value, or even half a fair value, for
its contributions can hold its own against
them. The large class of papers of the
Bits order are for the most part the
epitome of literary sweating—the apotheosis of
that journalistic art which is built out of scis-
sors and paste. They are sold cheaply, f or
exactly the same reasons which enable the cattle-
duffer to sell more cheaply than the man who
breeds his own cattle. Their proprietors have,
in the British Islands, a population of some forty
millions, “ mostly fools,” among whom to trade
off their publications, and in so large a com-
munity it is difficult to make a paper so abso-
lutely idiotic that it will successfully avoid
becoming a profitable property. And the surplus
of each week’s stock—the waste paper of the
office—slops over into Australia, often for the
sufficient reason that it is cheaper to send it
here than to sell it by the ton to a paper mill;
and because the public have a fondness for
literature at Chinese or Kanaka prices these
dreary consignments have so far served to
practically extinguish any attempts at founding
a distinctively Australian literature.
* • *
There is nothing on earth or in perdition more
infamously dull or stupid than the great mass of
the British papers which are dumped out of
every mail steamer on to the wharves of our
Australian cities. Their matter is borrowed
from each other, from their own back num-
bers, from each other’s back numbers, from
Joe Miller’s ancient jest-book, from Noah—
in short, from anywhere. Every hoary, time-
crusted gag is to be found in their pages, and
when the venerable chestnut has dropped out
of sight for a few months, it is revived and
reprinted, on the assumption that the public
has a short memory, and can read the same
wheeze over and over again all its life, and
never remember that it has seen it several
hundred times before. Where the original
British joke came from nobody is old enough to
remember, but presumably somebody wrote it,
and possibly was paid for it, in the days of old,
and all the cheap English papers have lived by
copying it ever since. The tales are mostly
embezzled from old magazines published beyond
the copyright term, and the items of “ useful
information ” are collected from miscellaneous
sources—chiefly through the agency of miser-
able correspondents who are promised cheap
clocks in exchange for their stealings. But if
the English paper which is made up of stolen
shreds and borrowed patches is a depressing
thing to read, the English original “comic”
print is sadder still. It also travels on its
cheapness, inasmuch as it is produced in a
cheap country, by cheap artists and cheap com-
positors, and cheap clerks, and a cheap office-
boy, and printed on cheap paper, and filled
with original matter which is so exceedingly
cheap that the average reader would imagine
the proprietors had been paid to take it away.
Ally Sloper’s Half-Holiday is a fair example
of the British humorous publication when it
cuts itself loose from the solemnly respectable
traditions of the ancient Punch, and launches
out wildly upon a sea of mirth, and no sadder
journal was ever edited by the wealthy literary
crank of a private lunatic asylum,
* « *
Sooner or later the question of Protection
against British cheap literature of the kind
which we have described must come to the
front. In this respect the Australian democrat
has, so far, shown himself utterly selfish. He
demands that he should be protected against
Chinese and Kanaka competition ; he regards it
as the duty of the ill-paid pressman to support
him in that aspiration ; and yet, wherever it is
possible to do so, he patronises literature pro-
duced under a system that is cheaper even than
Chinese cheap labour, and thereby denies to the
pressman the very advantages which he claim B
for himself. The only Australian journalistic
literature which the Australian ever buys
is the kind which can’t be imported. There-
fore, broadly speaking, there is no Aus-
tralian literature worthy of the name in
existence, only an ephemeral record of prize-
fights, brutal assaults, accidents in the harbour,


Parliamentary rows, horse-races, footbab*

p records of such properties as the

VkfIAZiNE, Federal Australian, and many

uficieucies, were still vastly superior to

to everybody who attempts a new
Tmartivrc in the Cou-forgotten realm of letters
on this continent.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Victorian Justice.
The attitude of Mr. Justice Hodges, when the
alleged murderer, Deeming, came up for trial
l st°Friday in Melbourne, was exactly what
uticht have been expected from any ordinary,
mistaking, mediocre official who is utterly
destitute of originality, and hidebound by too
much precedent and routine. The defence put
• a plea for an adjournment, and adduced
Ihree reasons for doing so—(1) that the prisoner
could not get a fair trial in the present excited
state of the public ; (2) that sufficient time
had not been allowed for preparing the
defence; and (3) that the question of the
prisoner’s sanity was involved, and it was
necessary to make elaborate inquiries into his
antecedents, in order to discover whether there
was any hereditary taint in his family, or
whether he had broken out into actual lunacy
in any of the five continents which he is alleged
to have pervaded in the course of his wild
career. The first of these three statements is a
self-evident truth. The papers have hurled
frantic anathemas at Deeming for weeks past
till there is hardly an individual left in Aus-
tralia who wouldn’t hang him quite cheerfully
without any evidence at all. The only
party which hasn’t already decided to hang
him is the party which wants to boil him
alive, or to nail him down on an ant-bed ;
ami "unless the jurors are taken from the
solitary cells' of the gaols, the prospect of
getting twelve men together who won’t
condemn the prisoner regardless of any-
thin" and everything, is absolutely nil. The
second statement is also self-evident. The
case for the prosecution was begun on the day
of the gruesome discovery at Windsor and was
supported by all the resources of the Treasury,
the detective office, and the Crown Law Depart-
ment ; the case for the defence was practically
only commenced two weeks ago, and has pro-
gressed since then in a haphazard way with no
detective force, or Treasury, or Crown Law
Office to help it—with nothing, in fact, but a
penniless prisoner and an unpaid solicitor whose
costs are probably irrecoverable. Under such
conditions as these any ordinary Judge, as a
matter of ordinary justice, might reasonably
have granted a substantial adjournment, but
Justice Hodges viewed the matter in a different
light. The third plea he disposed of promptly
by the off-hand assertion that the prisoner was
undoubtedly sane. Now, the Judge’s business
on the bench in the present instance is to decide
—or to help the jury to decide —on the evidence,
whether Deeming is sane or not, and when he
resolves the point beforehand, without waiting
for evidence, or relying solely on the evidence for
the prosecution, it is plainly no earthly use trying
the case at all. Mr. Hodges is not a medical
expert in any case, and the mere fact that he
is a judge no more qualifies him to decide upon
the sanity of an untried prisoner than upon the
composition of an undiscovered star. As for the
suggestion that the whole nation is too excited
at nresent to view Deeming in any other light
except as a man who ought to be hung without
ceremony, Judge Hodges didn’t think it a “suffi-
cient reason for postponement,” and he objected
to allow time to get up a defence, because
it was “ of the highest importance not only that
judgment should be sure, but speedy.” And it
probably never occurred to him that as judg-
ment had already been delayed in order to
allow time for getting up the case for the
prosecution, it was a miserably lop-sided pro-
ceeding to refuse a few weeks, or months, to
prepare a defence, and that this frantic desire
for speed would be quite as equitably served by
not hearing any defence at all. This red-hot
baste to hang an untried man looks too like
holding a brief for the gallows.
——
The Rogue-Elephant Judge.
Premier Griffith (Q.) has introduced a char-
acteristically Griffithian Contempt of Court
Bill, and has had it read a first time. The Bill actu-
ally reaffirms, with a coating of fresh enamel, the
gross and antiquated injustices of the present
law. Mr. Powers, M.P., desired to have the
crime of “contempt of court” relegated to a
jury rather than to permit it to be punished
off handedly by an irascible, liver-throbbing, or
gout-maddened Judge. Griffith has secured,
in complicated legal knottings, all the more
terrible of the Judge’s tyrannical powers. The
Bill certainly proposes to enact one large
reform, but there remain far worse evils.
It proposes to remove all chance of the
imprisonment of any person for that species of
“ contempt ” which consists of mere inability
to comply with a Judge’s order for the
payment of money, and so far the
measure may be hailed as usefully remedial.
But the rest of the Bill is a re-enactment of
tyrannies. A Judge is to have the single-
handed power of fining a person £5OO or £lOOO,
or of gaoling him or her for two years, for the
commission of any act (a gesture or unlucky
retort) which the Judge himself may construe
as “ contempt.” A Judge is to have the power,
under certain possible circumstances, of com-
mitting a person to gaol during his own
pleasure, that is, for his or her natural life, it
may be, and the sentence is to be beyond the
power of even the Governor-in-Council to
amend! This beats even British Imperial
judicial arrogance, and reminds us that Judge
Harding (Q.) who has so frequently and
emphatically demonstrated his unfitness for the
judgment-seat, once threatened to send a man
to gaol for 40 years ! Griffith’s Bill also
confers proportionately penal powers on gold
wardens, commissioners of various sorts, and
official arbitrators! It should be so cut up in
committee that no rogue-elephant of a Judge
shall be left with the full control of his trunk
and tusks.
The Kanaka’s Sympathisers,
A lot of excitement has been created in Aus-
tralia by the cabled report that thes.s. Mont-
serrat is cruising among the Gilbert Islands,
recruiting Kanakas for service on the coffee
plantations of Guatemala. “It is believed,”
says the cablegrammer, dejectedly, “that they
are being transported practically as slaves,”
and this painful intelligence has already aroused
sundry Australian papers to ask that something
should be done to prohibit the Unclean Thing
which is thus raising its infected head in the
South Seas. The Bulletin doesn’t exactly
see what the trouble is about. Supposing the
Montserrat is conveying Kanakas to Guatemala,
andpresuming that they are being conveyed there
as slaves, it doesn’t seem to make much differ-
ence. It is a painful thing that the Kanaka
should be a slave in Guatemala, but it is quite
as pleasant for him to be a slave there as in
Queensland —possibly a little more so. The
Queensland planter is an energetic individual
with a fixed resolve to get rich out of the profits
of his hard-driven nigger. The Central Ameri-
can planter has pretty nearly given up hopes of
getting rich, and three-fourths of his existence
is devoted to letting things slide. It is a hard
life to be a lazy man’s slave, but it is a
good deal harder to be the slave of a vigorous
money-grubber. The Kanaka who goes to
Guatemala will never get back to his native
islands, because no one will ever trouble to
send him back ; and if there is a law providing
for his return nobody will ever enforce the law,
and his chance of getting his wages is very
small, for hardly anybody ever gets paid in
that lotus-eating land ; but, on the other hand,
the Kanaka who goes to Queensland hardly
ever gets back either, and he generally has to
take his wages out in gaudy shirts and
other rubbish. The embezzled Polynesian
will probably get as commodious a grave
in one country as in the other, and he will
have an equally elegant tombstone in either
place ; and the Spanish - American priest or
the Queensland expounder will make a
few well - chosen remarks above his last
x’esting-place with the same unction; and in a
very few years it will be all the same to the
defrauded nigger whether he was taken to one
place or the other. Moreover, at the present
moment the Guatemalans are probably as much
grieved to hear about the Kanaka being a slave
in Queensland as the Queenslander is about him
being an alleged serf in Guatemala, and pro-
bably the kind-hearted Central American is
writing to his local paper to ask if something
can’t be done to put down this hideous traffic in
human flesh—just as the Australian is doing.
And last - of all the story is an almost self-
evident lie, for nine-tenths of the population of
Guatemala already consists of cheap, dark-
skinned labourers, and there is just as much
demand for more coloured labour in that
country as there is for imported coals at New-
castle.
+
To a young Australian-born Judge—Back-
house, of New South Wales—belongs the
credit of initiating the bold legal reform of
keeping accused persons out of the prisoner’s
dock until after they have been fairly tried and
justly (or unjustly) convicted. If the bitter
hostility exhibited by one or two Judges to the
law recently passed in several provinces that
enables an accused person to give evidence on
oath in his or her own defence, and the horri-
fied aversion shown towards counsel’s requests
that such witnesses should be allowed to go
into the ordinary witness-box, be any guides
towards revealing the general sentiments of the
judiciary, it is unlikely that the other Judges of
New South Wales will follow the fair-minded
example now set. Nevertheless, the new system
must prevail in the long run ; no matter what
alleged master-authorities oppose it, for it is
founded on justice. The present system is not
only grossly unfair, but absurd also. “ The
Crown ” now, almost every day, lets accused
persons out on flimsy bail that affords very
little, or absolutely no, guarantee of voluntary
appearance for trial; and then, after allowing
these people the free run of the country, with
every chance to escape in the meantime, it jams
them into the prisoner’s dock behind a row of
ferocious iron spikes, with a constable on guard
at either side as if they were going to run
away.
Gone kre the feet of another venerable idol. It
has often been asserted that the great safety of
the nation depends on the Upper House as a
preventive to “ hasty legislation.” Queensland
gives us a charming instance of the truth of this
theory. One of the most important and revolu-
tionary Bills ever placed before Parliament (the
Black Labour Act) has been rushed through the
Lower House in less than a month, and through
the Upper one in less than a week, and by the
Governor in less than an hour. Here was an
opportunity for the Legislative Council to dis-
tinguish itself if it had only been shrewd enough
to grasp the situation. Had the Council, acting
from purely sinister class purposes and with an
eye only on the ultimate interests of the
plutocracy which it represents, prevented this
unseemly rush, thrown out the Bill, and made
the Kanakilgriff go to the country, what a
grand answer could its members not have given
to those who would abolish the second Chamber !

In its issue of the 21st, Sydney Telegraph pub-
lishes a summary of the principles professed by
each member of the new Victorian Parliament,
and it is a melancholy fact that even the D.T.
only ventures to charge one of the whole crowd
with being a Freetrader ! This lonesome apostle
got in for an obscure country constituency by a
majority of just 23, and the reason he got in was
that the only other candidate advocated the
“ vote for Thrift,” tcetotalism, and the abolition
of the secular system of education. After this
it is to be hoped that the Telegraph will give
up publishing leaders to show that \ ictoria is
dead tired of Protection, and that a great
Foreign-trade movement is in progress, and that
the country will take the earliest opportunity to
“ shake oft' its bonds ” and to “ burst its shackles
asunder.” What the Telegraph takes for
shackles really clothes, and only an insane
nation wants to burst its clothes asunder and go
naked.

Many months ago a shareholder in the Mel-
bourne Premier Permanent Building Associa-
tion brought an action against a Mr. Stewart,
said to be the only director of that notorious
institution worth “going for” who hadn’t
already cleared out to England. The action
against this particular gentleman (who, not
having been a “ bleeder” of the P.P.8.A., was
considered to be honourably unfortunate in the
matter) was based upon an Act of Parliament
which makes each and every director of a
building society liable for the full amount of
money accepted in excess of a certain borrowing
limit fixed by the Act, or something equally
ruinous and unpleasant for said directors. Tim
case never appeared to come to an issue. Judg-
ment was reserved for an indefinite period, or
an everlasting injunction intervened, perhaps.
A few months later another shareholder brought
a like action against the same party, and this
second applicant was disposed of, apparently,
by the defence that the first action was still un-
decided. Wherefore The Bulletin would like
to know when this knotty point is likely to be
determined, and where the use of an Act of
Parliament comes in if the point is never to be
decided at all ?
“ Justitia ” tells Sydney Echo' that convicted
prisoners, sick or well, must be made to feel
that “ the way of transgressors is hard,” and
that, no matter what physical ills a prescribed
punishment may entail on individual subjects,
that punishment must be rigorously meted
out to the very end. In other words, if a
sentence of penal servitude involves the death
of a prisoner when death was not intended, that
prisoner must be killed as per natural or acci-
dental sequence. “ Justitia ” here usurps the
omniscience of the Almighty, and the vengeance
of the Mosaic Jehovah. The release of any
prisoner to whom continued confinement means
certain premature death, cannot wound the
ideality of justice. The only evil to be guarded
against in the operation of the beneficent rule
is that of favouritism. All prisoners, poor as
well as rich, the uninfluential as well as the
“well-connected,” should be impartially re-
garded from a physiological as w r ell as an ethical
standpoint.

The proposal of Lumley Hill— ex-squattophile
M.L.A. (Q.) —to introduce the ballot into Par-
liamentary divisions, was probably an idea
borrowed from American or Canadian politi-
cians, who have been hustling with that project
of late years, though it has not yet been
adopted. The fact is that, so long as Party
Government—“ Government by Contradiction,”
as The Bulletin has called it—.-remains in
vogue, the idea of introducing the ballot into
Parliamentary voting is impracticable. It
would mean the abolition of the only surety
which the electors now have of a representa-
tive’s fidelity to his stump pledges. It would
shield a Judas from the consequences of his
basest treachery, for your Parliamentary J udas
never gets a worm-eaten conscience, and so is
never remorseful enough to go and hang him-
self. When the day comes which witnesses
the abandonment of Party Government, and the
adoption of a committee-system somewhat
similar to that in vogue in Switzerland, the use
of the ballot in Parliamentary divisions will at
least be understandable, even if it does not
follow sequentially as a corollary of the new
style. That day will also witness the election
to Parliament of men, not toadies—patriots,
not log-rollers —statesmen, not cats’-paws. But
until that day, open voting is as necessary for
the public interest as open speech. Party-men
must be kept plainly in the fiercest rays of the
electric-light.
Cbuickshank, a New South Wales M.L.A.’
can see no justice in applying the “ betterment
principle ” to lands resumed for the purpose of
constructing a certain railway. He admits
that he owns 15,000 acres near the proposed
line of route, and that his estate would be
benefited by at least £1 per acre, or a minimum
of £15,000; but he evidently considers this
should be all “ bunco ” to him, a bonus, in fact,
for his longheadedness in previously collaring
the land, while he generously announces his
willingness to pay a “small tax” to the
Government if they should put this trivial sum
of £15,000 into his pocket. Now, it would be
no shocking injustice if the Government, on
behalf of the people,, insisted on receiving
the whole of the £15,000, less the value
of the resumed portion, from Cruickshank, per
security of equitable mortgage on the whole of
the improved property. His candid admission of
asserted prerogative is distinctly good, as show-
ing how landholders believe they have a right
to bleed the community by compelling the State
to enhance the value of their properties by the
expenditure of moneys drawn from the whole
nation.
The French, in Dahomey, are cabled to be
after a huge treasure, buried in the tombs of the
kings. The English made a haul of this kind
years ago at Gwalior. After Scindia’s death they
dug up five millions, in rupees, from under the
seraglio, although the men who buried it had
been murdered, forsecresy.
By Prussian law no prince of the royal
family is allowed to borrow money, nor is anybody
permitted to lend him money. If anyone does
lend, the coin is irrecoverable. It is a good law
in its way, but it doesn’t go far enough. What is
wanted in order to abolish usury, pawnbroking,
bad debts, insolvency, and a lot of other evils, is a
law by which no person who lends money can
recover it by any legal process whatsoever.
Faiz Mahomet, camel-owner and carrier, of
Hergott Springs, S.A., has purchased from the
S A. Geographical Society the 44 camels used by
the collapsed Lindsay-Elder exploring picnickers,
and intends to establish a regular carrying service
between York and Yilgarn, W.A., and Geraldton
and the Murchison. He intends to import 100
more desert-ships—the business capacity of each is
five cwt. Faiz Mahomet already keeps GOO camels
going in South Australia.
Judging from a significant portion of the
evidence in the Hemmant (Q.), tragedy it is by
no means certain that the police have the real
murderer in Ilorrocks.
Deeming must have read “ Caesar’ 8
Column,” The similarity of the disposal of the
dead in both Donnelly’s work and Deeming’s
“ work ” is a coincidence, at all events.
The Victorian Eight-hours’ procession gave
cheers at Melbourne Herald office. This much
pleased the Herald. They must have cheered
the paper’s murder and divorce reports ; certainly
not its politics.
The Hon. Patrick Greville-Nugent has
been remanded in London on a charge of assault-
ing a lady in a first-class carriage on the Brighton
railway. In cases of the Valentine-Baker sort
there are, of course, only two people present and
the presumption is always against the man.
Hemming was the most original candidate
before a Victorian constituency at last week’s
election. Says an elector : “ Will you support the
Word of God in the State schools?” Hemming:
“The—ah—Word of God?” Elector: “I mean
the Bible.” Hemming: “Oh, certainly!” .Re-
minds you of General Booth’s sarcastic declaration
to an American clergyman who doubted his
orthodoxy : “ I believe the Bible—every comma.”
Donald, the Queensland aboriginal con-
victed of rape, has been hanged. It is mighty
unlucky to be a Bananaland blackfellow with a
Scotch name. Johnny Campbell, who met his
death in a similar way, discovered that. Though
he had a long run for his money, some, or all of
his remains went in good time to that now-departed
scientist, Baron Macleay, who put them in spirits.
How Johnny did love to soak in spirits while he
was alive!
Richard Jefferies’ bust is unveiled at last
in Salisbury Cathedral. It is the work of Miss
Thomas, who received her training in Melbourne
from that genius, Charles Summers, brother of
Dr. Joseph Summers, the well-known Melbourne
musical professor. Charles Summers, as a young
man, won the London Royal Academy first prize
for sculpture. In Melbourne he had to descend
to shocking potboilers, but retrieved at Rome.
His wife was French, and their son, Charles
Summers, is a tolerable sculptor.
Dr. Dubois-Eeymond declares, respecting
accidents under chloroform, that much of the
chloroform used by ordinary practitioners, and
notoriously that supplied to the various European
armies and in use on shipboard and in warm
climates, is inferior and unfit for use. In all the
rules laid down for the administration of anaesthe-
tics, there is nowhere any injunction that the
physician must test his chloroform before using
it. For climatic reasons, ether, otherwise duly
extolled by English authorities, is considered en-
tirely unfit for use in India.
“ Clancy of the Overflow,” known all over
Australia as one of the “Banjo’s” brightest efforts
in verse, was reprinted by Melbourne Herald the
other day without acknowledgement of either
“ Banjo ”or Bulletin, and under a new title. It
seems that the Herald editor, on being taxed with
the cool annexation by every third man of his
acquaintance, explained that he merely clipped
the set of verses “from an English paper.” In a
few years time he will be clipping them again
from a North African weekly, for such flowers of
literature flourish all over the earth from one year’s
end to another. The other day. by the way, “ The
Banjo ” met with a polo accident which went
within an ace of depriving him of his right eye.
Dear Bulletin, —Bavcroft H. Boake, in
his yarn, “ After Cattle,” states that lo drink
blood is to court delirium.” My experience is
totally different. It was my misfortune some
years ago to be cast away on a sand-bank, where
there was no water obtainable, except when it
rained. It was in the tropics, and long spells of
dry weather occurred during which we had no-
thing but blood to drink, which was obtained
from turtle. Although we partook largely of the
fluid I never noticed the least sign of delirium
arising from it. I have, however, been delirious
through drinking large quantities of salt water,
and would no doubt have shared the same fate as
some of my comrades (three of whom died) had it
not rained opportunely. — Yours, &c., CASTAWAY.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Round the foot of the mountain ho rode without
break to the city of smoke.
Through the grey and black clouds rolling towards
him two luminous azure eyes broke,
And a mouth with red lips made the air all
a-tremble with passionate words,
That were louder than bells of cathedrals and
sweeter than singing of birds.
They said “ Como ! ” And the word sailed along
for a second, then with a cry
As if suddenly filled with an impulse to shout the
glad tidings on high,
It shot forward and soared ; again “ Come” came,
and soaring and singing they blent,
And then severed and cried from far distances
over the wide firmament.
Again “ Come ! ” again “ Come ! ” again “ Come !”
till the air round about and above
Was an organ with pedals and keys at the feet and
the fingers of Love ;
And the pipes were full charged with the thrills
and the throbs and the sighs and the cries
Of the languorous longings that swoon and the
passions which surge to the skies.
Do we wonder he heard not the clink and the clank
the hoofs, galloping, woke?
But the earfuls of sounds were not more than the
eyefuls of visions that broke
On him —flashing of azure and white from long-
fringed, quiv’ring lids, and the tips
Of white pearly small teeth, rosebud like, gleam-
ing out from divided red lips.
So he raced to the City of Smoke, But two nights
and a day, and again _
He careered round the mountain once more to his
desolate hut on the plain ;
And behind and before and around him the air was
both empty and still,
Save the clink and the clank of the hoofs of the
horse on the base of the hill.
And his heart was lead-heavy, and all things
looked bitter and barren and bare ;
In the skies there was nothing to gladden; nor
vision nor voice in the air ;
And his world was consumed into ashes, and down
by the black ruin lay
Death, the drunkard, asleep after quaffing the
blood of a bride of a day.

816 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, April 27, 1892.
My Dear Mooeabinda, —
Almost too many people went forth to Sydney Horti-
cultural Society’s Chrysanthemum Show, the other day.
l.ady J., Lady G. and lion. Violet Willoughby, squired by
Lord Ancrura, must have been nearly suffocated by the
herd that crowded in their vicinity, for “whithersoever
thou goest we will go,” is the battle-cry o'f the mob when-
ever vice-royalty is observed pausing gushfully with blue-
ribboned committee-men (always in black coats and top
hats held gracefully in front) before any’ exhibit, whether a
hortus siccus or a hog. Making the inevitable pretty
speeches could have been no trouble to Lady Jersey at the
Mum Show, which was in every way most successful. The
exhibits were well-grown, well-coloured and well-grouped,
and I didn t detect one blank in the profusion of
tloralities. But what you always miss in a tug of flowers
without scent is the perfume in the air ; massed ’mums
are about as pleasantly odoriferous as colocynth “split”
with turps, and so it was a treat to hang round a small
show of roses,in a dark corner.
Apropos, the Centennial Hall is a great deal too gloomy
to hold an exhibition in, and even on the sunniest day
you need lights to see what’s happening under the
galleries. Nobody ever dreams of dressing to flutter by
daylight in such a darksome crypt, so I wasn’t the least
surprised that Lady J. wore the pink crepon with cream
lace and silver applique, and flat bonnet of pearls, topped
off with red currants, that she sported at Melbourne Derby
last year. Lady Galloway’s gown was a mauve silk, with
floral pattern in mulberry, trimmed with lines of velvet
round the hem, visite of black lace and gold gimp, very
stylish bonnet of black velvet and jet, with coronet of
pink roses, grey fur boa. Miss Willoughby contrasted
black and melon-pink very cheerfully, but my attention
was distracted by what looked like the passing of a
vivandiire— have they one, I wonder, at Paddington
barracks? This young lady was in blue cloth, violently
lit up with bright scarlet, a small cocked hat with rubes-
cent ribbons perched rakishly on one hair—and a little,
straw, canteen-ish wallet hanging over her shoulders !
A very thin crowd waded out to Randwick on the off-
day (21st inst.) to hear black “Marvel” hooted after
winning the second race he entered for, and, as the
weather was what Sylvia Grey would call “naughty,”
even the most aristocratic people looked like last winter
bogies come to haunt us for our sins. Yet, despite the
rain, a few women wore new garments—Lady Jersey
for one, who had on a dark-green dress with scarlet
trimmings, wide black hat with feathers ; Lady Galloway
also wore a wide black hat, and relied on the pale-blue
bows with which it was sprinkled over for colour-effect •
Lady Charles Scott (“cousin of Lady Clarke”) sported a’
white feather in her wide hat, and the other lady of the
vice-regal party was imposing in rather theatrical'crimson
and gold.
On the members’ stand, Mrs. Arthur Macarthur’s seal-
skin jacket, with Beatrice-collar, was a very taking gar-
ment; Miss Austin covered half her black-beaded'dress
with a boa of feathers ; 31rs. Frank Gardiner’s well-fitting
gown of brown and blue cheviot was trimmed with brown
feathers and blue silk, and she wore a dark-blue feathered
bat an exceedingly stylish turn-out; but a combination
of brown velvet, checked with gold and brown bengaline,
the whole trimmed with gold galon, was certainly the
handsomest dress on the course. Stone-pink silk, with
trimmed silver and floral bonnet, was worn by a very
wealthy woman ; Mrs. Flood’s gown of carrotty-coloured
tweed was tightened by a vest of blue Oriental broidery,
and Mrs. Severn had apparently trimmed her hat with
chilies. Also a great cry went up that Billie Barlow had
arrived but it proved to be only an old man’s darling,
evidently proud of her (facial) resemblance to (hat blithe-
some song-and-dance artist. Most of the people left early
on account of the vice-regal ball.
On Steeplechase Saturday, the last day of Randwick
Faster meeting, I saw two Italians stand (or quite five
minutes with rapt faces turned to the brilliant sky. They
may hove been looking for signs of the times, or brick-
bats, or something, but I chose toseehome-sweet-homeish
sentiment in their dirty faces, and a Southern tribute to
our charming weather, too. Indeed, the day was the
loveliest thing on view at Randwick in spite of there
being such a mob on the raembers’-stand, all gnashing
their more or less locally-produced teeth when the
favourite turned turtle at the last jump, and dear old
Grafton (of course I had gloves on him) cantered calmly
past the judge, leaving a trail of mangled jockeys and
spilt horses in wake.
The Governor's box (placed, by tire way, in the middle
of the grand stand which is, comparatively, a howling
social wilderness) revealed a trio of titled women in very
calm and ordinary raiment. Whether it is that the lady
with a projection beyond her front name considers that
her titular attractions are like other people’s beauty, best-
unadorned, I leave you to puzzle out, but it is a calm and
unflattering fact that if you want to put your hand on an
all-round dowdy in a hurry you may safely put your trust
in princes every time. Hon. Violet Willoughby in black,
sported a cream silk vest flowered in pink roses and a
black hat; Lady Dora Carnegie in black, wore a pink
vest; her sister was in black muffled up in a puttv-
rolourcd jacket. On the Members’ stand, Mrs. Frank
Gardiner wore one of the handsomest dresses on the
course. The skirt was of fawn cloth cut umbrella-shaped
and lined round the hem with brown velvet; the coat,
-caching to the knees, of brown velvet with rovers and
full waist of brown bengaline piped round the collars
with fawn ; fawn felt hat trimmed with brown velvet and
fawn feathers exactly matching, and parasol cn suite.
Rather a peaceful frock was a cigar-brown cloth combined
with pink silk veiled in brown guipure ; and pretty .Miss
Aland Gowlland, looking chirpy after her Tasmanian
experiences, was bright but not gaudy in blue and
crimson.
I hastened to obey the “Trumpet Call 1 ' at Sydney
Royal the other eve, and stood aghast, as usual, at the
infinite detail of Bland Holt’s staging. The church
interior and bridal set-to in the last scene was enough to
draw the nurse-girls into the theatre by what Bland Holt-
Oennifer calls “physio” attraction, and the numerous
soldiers who paraded on the canvas scene were very con-
vincing perhaps because they were the genuine thing
enticed from the “ Barracks ” to adorn the talc greatly to
the disgust of Poverty Point. Mrs. Bland Holt, as
Lavinia, a typical music-hall artist, had thought out some
very fearful frocks. Red tartan trimmed with glaring
gieen velvet, for instance ; pink and bright-blue (in which
get-up she imitated the army goose-step to a T) was
another, and Solomon in all his glory would not have
crossed the street if he had seen Lavinia coming round
t!ie corner in the silver and scarlet tinsel jacket braided
with gold, scarlet skirt diamonds, and red three cornered
tart shaped hat which she adorned the inevitable
wedding in. Vet Mrs. Holt was ladylike even in those
shrieks, and only her “ business ” was loud. Kate Bishop
was heroine and looked well in the china-blue cloth and
velvet gown with brown velvet fur-lined cloak of the first
act; her heliotrope crcpon and velvet dress with llirce-
cornered hat en suite was very taking, too, but I must
object on anachronistic grounds to her pretty garlanded
white wedding-dress of the last act. In real life, when
the plaintiff widow prepares for another metamorphosis
etiquette decrees that she must annex her new victim in
lonely, tender tints—something the colour of an elephant
swooning in a fog, say—hut white, which is ever virginal,
is only allowed to the lady who takes her first connubial
header. Edith Blande’s first gipsy dress was very pic-
turesque, and so were her ensuing shreds and patches.
To the woman with a good Roman fall in her spine all
things sartorial are possible.
Anson s benefit at the Royal (“kindly lent by Bland
Holt ) last Monday attracted a crowded house, including
everybody but Lord and Lady Jersey, who have seemingly
“put away ” Sydney theatrical shows. All the “ Parlia-
ment men” were there, and such a national event was
this valedictory mumming, that the Cabinet was pro-
rogued by special act on Friday until 7 p.m. on Monday,
so that members might attend to sob in reserved places
over the only Anson and —well, if truth must be said—to
shed a silent grin over James Richelieu Toohey, M.P.
Anson s farewell speech was simple and full of honest
feeling, yet, after the ordeal of the gorgeous illuminated
address (and the sovs.) fired at him by a prominent man,
it seemed rather thin for him to pretend that he really
didn t want to go. Then there were flowers and handker-
chief agitations—but farewells are as “stereotyped as
commemorations, and the only novel excitement I saw’
was the run-forward awful figure of the Bland Holt lie-
actors cut in cream Spanish lace pants. As for the audi-
ence, well-known people occurred every minute, but most
of the people looked curiously under their hat-brims at
Miss Billie Barlow (Mrs. Stewart), who sat very demurely
in the front stalls, wearing a pale heliotrope gown, with
Mrs. Bland Holt beside her. I didn’t notice much else—
that is really the drawback of a shower of regretful tears,
isn’t it?
The Wagga polo potentate who made such ungram-
matical reference to Tub Bulletin’, mixing plurals with
singulars into a regular jungle of syntax—but then, it’s
just possible that a man can’t be smart at polo and
English in the same breath !—evidently forgot what he
did and how he was “ done ” not an age agone. A picked
team of players were to be taken to Melbourne to whip
their cob-tailed ponies up and down against the nobility
and gentry of Toorak, and our particular poloist wanted
his team to hold their own from their top-boots upwards
against the dandy South. But his best man had a beard
like a bottle-brush, and as the “ navy shave ” was raging,
the V. P. had nightmares over the tufted chin of his crack
Player. After many anxious nights he at last diplomati-
cally approached the subject through a third party:
“ Don t you—aw —think youah brothah would look moah
polished if he shaved? Meet nice-people, Melbourne,
doncherknow,” &c. Brother did shave—but the result
must have quite shocked the first families who noticed
him, for he was barbered like a prize-fighter, had a
regular all-round gaol-crop. Ever since then the P.P.
mentioned frequently above has allowed his followers to
come out coiffured d la Parkes, if they feel like it.
Government House showed Sydney hospitality the way
on 21st inst., when the first ball of the season ’92 even-
tuated as per expectation. The hostess wore a dress of
sunflower-yellow satin with diamond ornaments, which
became her exceedingly, and opened the ball with
Admiral Scott; Lady Galloway wore a black-pink mer-
veilleux softened with pink crepe chiffon, pearls and
diamonds for jewellery, and danced in the opening r t
with Lord Jersey ; Lady Charles Scott, in dragon-blue ana
pale-blue chiffon, was Brother Rupert No. 2‘s partner.
The Hon. \iolet Willoughby, in white satin and the inevi-
table chiffon, and tire eldest Jersey girl in eau-de-nil silk
and cream embroidery, made up the house-party which
trooped into the ball-room (where Brother Rupert No. 1
had been industriously welcoming the incoming influx) at
9.15. Other dresses were carefully thought out, and the
handsomest turn-out, from the barbered hair to the shoe-
cap, was fittingly worn by the handsomest woman.
The leading actors in a sudden Southern society match
have begun to dodge their creditors, and already the
gaunt landlady is roosting on their luggage.
The vice-regal garden-party on 22nd inst. (when lady
Jersey wore a black gown with a sprightly pink sprig,
bonnet cn suite ) being a dismal and sacred kind of festival
was very welcome to the tired society person who simply
stood about in the warm sunlight and passed away as soon
as she decently could. The Union Club tall on the same
evening was the usual dream of joy. White was very
much worn, and the Empire bow was flattened against the
scapulae of the razor-backed old maid and the dimpled
darling in equal numbers. Also, the merry barn-dancers,
received once more into the fold, were all there (in the
custody of their pa’s).
And now the races are over for the present, I want to
complain loudly about the afternoon tea in the members’
tea-room-not about the quantity, but the quality, and
the ware in which same is served.
People don’t always come back with stuccoed manners
from a whirl ii Yewrop?. For instance, a recently-
returned magnate stood in a prominent position at a
festive gathering the other day and adroitly scratched his
l ight knee with his left foot! Can it he possible that the
P. of W. stands on one leg, too, like a roosting chick ?
Ex-Mayor Burdekin lias adopted gloomy goggles since
his return from Hingland. Who is it that he doesn’t want
to sec ?
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

At Sydney Criterion, on Saturday last,
Haddon Chambers’ four-act play of “ Captain
Swift” was produced before a crowded house,
with Mr. Titheradge in the character of Wilding,
the reformed bushranger. The more one thinks
about this play, the more unsatisfactory it
becomes. As Mr. Titheradge presents the leading
character magnanimous, polite, gentlemanly,
courageous, not a tincture of the flaneur about
him—the impossibility of connecting him in any
way with a dubious past grows almost glaringly
apparent. Save only in the fourth act, he makes
one acknowledge that ho (Captain Swift) could
have been a felon only in a dream. He might have
robbed, aye, and murdered, as a gentlemanly and
high-bred pastime—as the knights of old were
wont to rob and slay—as a conscious scoundrel,
never. There is little necessity to recapitulate the
plot. It must be fresh in the minds of manj who
saw Mr. Warner’s version a year or so ago. The
revival recalls the recollection of the performance
in Sydney of Mr. Chambers’ other play, “The
Idler,” and the points of similarity between the
two pieces raise the suggestion as to the lirnita-
MAX ORELL.
tions of the playwright’s capabilities. Both plays
deal_ with a man’s past, and the inconvenient
turning up of somebody who knows it, not wisely,
but too well ; and both plays end with a revolver,
though in “The Idler” the suicide is only
meditated, not accomplished. By the way, here
is a theme for a dramatic genius to wrestle with—
a man’s future ! Another suggestion the present
production raises, is the unfortunate naming of
the squatter interested in psychology. “Captain
Swift ” has for its central interest the fact that
its hero was a bushranger; the man who knows
his bashranging past, through a “ sticking-up ”
incident, is named Gardiner. That is enough!
Throughout the performance the two words
“Gardiner” and “ bushranger ” become closely
associated, and one is not sure absolutely of the
r al marauder—appearances notwithstanding,

AHss rattle Browne was a pert and perkv Mabel
Seabrook with a vast deal of vivacity*in her
acting, which, hoAvevcr, occasionally suggested a
certain out-of-placeness, which might perhaps have
been admirably commc il fuut in a comedy farce.
Miss Emma Temple, avlio was Avarmly Avelcomed
on her entrance, gave a refined sketch of Stella
Darbishor, and Miss Seymour’s Lady Staunton
ovenvhelmed nobody. Betiveen the Wilding of
Mr. Titheradge and the Mrs. Seabrook of Miss
Watt-Tanner, honors were, however, fairly divided.
This lady has seldom equalled, certainly never
surpassed, by anything we can remember, her
presentation,’ ;of the bushranger’s mother ; her
acting occasionally rose to the very heights of
painful realism. We do not predict a long run
for Captain Swift it is too good a product!™
to be properly appreciated by a Sydney audieno
whose taste is woefully vitiated by melodrarn
pantomime, and comedy farce. na >

At Sydney Royal the remains of “ Maste
and Man,” and the bulky form of a large convi t
have been decently interred, and the blood r i
gleam of a blast-furnace has been extinguished f
a season. On Saturday a fresh perpetration }
Cop. li. Sims and Robert Buchanan,
“Trumpet Call,” threw its marriage-and-divcm
ful glamour o’er a Holtian audience, and a stro,
gallery mu-tered to gloat over the stabs and f,l! K
constabulary of the new show. The bugle-blast '
question is founded on that never-failing theme”*
the man who marries a second time while his fi r ~l
wife, whom he imagines to be dead, is still living
with the never-failing corollary of a previous
band of the first wife’s, who turns up—-we ha 1
this in Australian real life, in the Euston case—to
a late period and sanctities the hero’s subsequent
marriage. There is, moreover, another man wh
wants to marry the second wife, and the o the°
man, as always happens in these cases, is rich ' *
inverse ratio to the hero's poverty, and the who/'
menagerie is relieved and the tragedy of ]jf
ameliorated—as also always happens in anythin
bearing the names of Sims and Buchanan 8
by the haggard jokes of a low comedian ' the
querulousness of a stage matron, and the breeyv
gags of a parti-colonred maiden in love with some
body whom she unmercifully guys for three h onr '
and twenty minutes of al fresco courtship, t,
regard to the “Trumpet Call,” the scenery i!
superb, the uniforms are enchanting, and grin?
visaged war doth smooth his wrinkled front and'
sugar his gunpowder, in the interests of a latter
day love of peace at any price, with beer and
tobacco thrown in, and no extra charge for pine
clay. 1 ■'
i it a
The ‘ ‘ Trumpet Call ” j s
almost Rignoldian in its multi-
fariousness; no less than 25
billed performers answering to
their names on the muster-roll
Of these Mr. Glenny, as the
much-married hero, seizes first
place with provoking facility
his military make-up and the
bullion on his jacket alone
being worth more than the
price of admission. His acting
is, moreover, dignified, manly
and natural ; and in the scenes
with his little (stage) boy he
conveys the impression of being
a born father—and paternity,
like greatness and poetry, is
a matter of
birth and not
of education.
Miss Kate
Bishop, who is,
throughout the
progress of the
drama, i n a
permanently
dazed state as
to whether she
is married or
single, is an
eminently snc-
cessf u 1 Con-
stance, and
weeps her way
a second time
to the altar in
a style that
leaves nothing
to be desired.
Mr. Walter
Howe is pain-
fully situated
as an intend-
ing bridegroom who never achieves his matri-
monial ruin, and Mr. A. Norman effectively
gets drunk in his regimentals with a desire to
emulate Deeming in wife-murder, and ultimately
succeeds in committing suicide with great Mat.
Miss Edith Blande, in a red wig, impersonates
several varieties of adventuress, and dies at last
repentant, in a brown cloak, within the walls of a
sacred edifice. Mr. Baker has a good carriage
and a knock-kneed brogue as Sergeant Milligan,
and Miss Flora Anstead upholds the dignity of an
ancient matron with an artistic capability which is
all her own. The sunshine of the melodrama is
supplied by Mrs. Bland Holt, and-the ever-Eland
himself throws out various cheerful remarks of a
humorous nature touching the salient points of
the Windsor murder. The remaining doz°n or so
characters are upholstered in many shades of war-
paint, and their special excellencies are too
numerous to mention. Likewise, the scenery is
admirably painted by Mr. George Gordon.

At Sydney Her Majesty’s, “ Dick Whit-
tington” continues to draw bumper houses, and
the gray-headed songs and the moss-grown joco-
sities unwind their respectable longitude with the
due appreciation that ever greets an old friend.
Miss Lilian Davies is nightly encouraged to dance
as never naval siren danced before, and the fat
boy rolls over the stage With a vague' sense of his
responsibility to endeavour to do nothing un-
becoming a 25-stone infant. Miss Billie Barlow
has thoroughly established herself as a hard-and-
fast favourite of the Sydney public, and not all
the anarchists of Spain with all their dynamite
could now remove her from her place in the hearts
and bosoms of a crowded house.
*■ * * *
'I he Sydney Opera House is once more
open, and people crowd in nightly to secure a
silver tea-and-coffee service, and to have their
craniums felt. Professor Simon is somewhat of a
wonder in his way. Ho manages to induce twelve
or more respectable male and female citizens to
supply a delighted audience with a mirth-provok-
ing entertainment, while he walks round them h>
evening-dress, looks enquiringly at them through
inquisitorial eye-glasses, and persuades them to
exhibit their paces in a promenade before the
footlights. Then ho allows himself to be blind-
folded and picks out a stranger by simply feeling
the heads of Ids hastily-scanned subjects. In
sheer, downright, genuine fun Professor Simon’s
entertainment is more meaty than a comedy-
farce.

The Garrick is now exclusively the home
of “Cinderella” and her two sisters, and an
elephantine comedian nightly pays his addresses
to a stage moon. This is positively and actually
and truly the last week (vide the advertisement)
of Rice’s popular “Evangeline” company, and
the show bears up bravely under the heavy weight
of three burlesques per night. On Saturday next
a complimentary matinee will be given to Miss
Virginia Earl.

Max O’Rell opens his Australian campaign
; Sydney Centenary Hall to-night (Thursday),
when he will give a description of “ The English
•it Home ” from a humourist’s point of view.
O’Rcll, who is the second of the four stars engaged
1 ji.’g. Smythe when he was in England last
vear is one of the most popular writers who have
over' visited this country: his books have had a
larger sal® C |au those of Forbes, Proctor, Sala,
and Stanley put together. In “Jonathan’s Con-
tinent ” every literary and artistic club, beginning
with the Lotos at New York, delighted to do him
honour; and although he keenly criticised the
Americans, lie has been able to pay thi'ee
visits to the laud of the almighty dollar without
Ijehur obliged, like Boz,, to publish an abject
an logy for his caustic strictures. The author of
“John Bull ” says he never lectures, because he
never has that dreadful table and glass of water
on the platform. As for Iris satire, it is said to be
as keen as the blade of the celebrated executioner
who could cut a man’s head off without his know-
jnc it until a pinch of snuff would cause a sneeze
and the decapitated head would find itself rolling
in the gutter. On Saturday, Max O’Rell will give
“ A Nioht wi’ Sandie.” The sketch of O’Rell in
tliis week’s Bulletin is by G. R. Ashton, after
Paleologue, the famous caricaturist of Vanity
Fair.

“ The Solicitor ” has caught on with no
uncertain clutch at Melbourne Bijou. The time
wars ripe for this wild narrative of a lawyer who
went on the loose, and the climax of the second
act is hailed with such a shout as is heard in no
other Melbourne theatre every evening till further
notice. Gilbert Brandon’s cab-drive is a topic
familiar in the public mouth as false-teeth, and
ranks next in importance to the question whether
“Williams ” ate his first batch of reminiscences
after swallowing the ink. A cab is at all times a
rich subject for reflection, especially a hansom cab.
It is the vehicle in which ardent bachelors delight
to swear away their liberty, and a favourite resort
for married men who are going home drunk. One
is generally taken off to the hospital in the very
same hansom that another fellow presently hires
for attending the funeral in. Likewise—although
this has little bearing on the question—cabby
knows his fare. In fact, cabby ought to
know his fare, considering that he is always
taking observations through a hole in the roof.
He’s the sweet little cherub who sits up aloft
and sees if your morals are slack—but this is
madness. The main lesson of “The Solicitor” is
that cabby may sometimes know too much about
ids fare, but there is also a subsidiary suggestion
to the effect that the British officer is a demon
when mashed. Otherwise the comedy teaches
nothing in particular and leaves less to be desired.
Mr. Fabert’s first Melbourne appearance, as Percy
Roy of “the talent, ’is a success. Miss Brenda
Gibson pleases everybody more than usual, and
all the other ladies form delightful artistic contrasts
to all the other gentleman. Perhaps Miss Major,
as the handmaiden with an everlasting hunger,
holds the largest mirror up to nature. She doesn’t
say much, but her method of consuming solids is
intensely human.

“ Fedora,” at the Opera House, receives
plenty of sassiety patronage and all-round support,
without having produced a special thrill. There
would seem to be no chance of a pronounced Beere
boom until the “ star ” reaches Sydney, where, if
well advised, she will open in “ Masks and Faces,”
and work up to tragedy later on. The first per-
formance of “ Fedora,” on Easter Monday night,
concluded with a premature descent of the curtain
and a burst of sobs from Mrs. Bernard Beere,
whose leading man (Herbert Standing) bad
knocked all the bottom out of the agony by for-
getting his lines and leaving the situation to speak
for itself. After this fiasco Mr. Standing returned
to the sick-list. Otho Stuart took over the role of
Ipanoff, and has done his level best to reconcile
the mannerisms of an earnest young British curate
with the character of a Russian count. Mrs.
Beere’s performance of Princess Fedora is uneven,
but always attractive, and the show is neatly
finished off in most places. On Saturday they
will try “ London Assurance,” which may, or may
not, last out the remaining fortnight of the season.

“ Wilful Murder ” still goes ou its corpse
at the Alexandra for five nights in the week.
“Hamlet,’ with Dampier to the fore, drewagood
houselastFriday,and will dodutyagain to-morrow
(20th), when Mr. T. R. Treloar is to make his first
appearance in Melbourne, and endeavour to throw
new light on the origin of the Dane’s murderous
propensity. It is now believed that Hamlet was
an instinctive criminal.
* * * *
The “ Carmen ” experiment is fairly suc-
cessful, at Melbourne Princess’s, considering that
the opera contains no funny man with a bald head,
and doesn’t conclude with a chorus. If the dead
bodies of the giddy gipsy girl and her discarded
soger were placed on stretchers and sung to by the
whole strength of the company the finish would
be more satisfactory. Or if the management
would throw in a double “wake,” and let the
Loyal Ballerinas dance at it, the climax would be
more comforting than at present. However, there
is much to admire in this bustling musical story,
and it serves as an awful warning to girls who
choose new lovers for the sake of their new clothes.
Carmen’s sudden passion for the Toreador is a
mere matter of velvet and spangles versus slops.
’’ :l ‘she is handicapped out of the contest by his
mg suit, and although he might hold his own
against the rest of the ridiculous Spanish

no sort of show against the gaudy
By ley. The one man is properly dressed
to kill, whilst the other kills on account of not
being properly dressed. Marie Halton wins
general approval for her acting of the central
character. It is true that she carries a superfluity
or embonpoint, and doesn’t smoke with the gusto
expected of a girl engaged in the ’bacca trade,
, s “ e certainly contrives to look like a damsel

iJle ohaugliraun ” put. in a long-threat-
-net! re-appearance at the Royal on Saturday.
“The Shaughraun ” was a good Irish drama of
an already familiar pattern vvhen Boucicault first
produced it, and now it is just as good but much
more familiar. The jokes can be sniffed in the
distance, the sensations cast long, dark shadows
before, and everything happens just as you ex-
pected. In fact, there is no excuse left for this
hardened offender to offer, except a totally new
and original conception of Conn. J. F. Sheridan
gets as near as possible to originality, and cer-
tainly introduces a new brand of Shaughraun.
The bloom of youth is on his hairless chin. He is
the white-haired boy of the district, in a measure,
and Moya’s affection for him seems natural.
The average Conn doesn’t wash himself
enough to gain the esteem of that young
person in real life, but Sheridan looks as
fresh as paint all the time. It is no small
thing for the actor to thus cast aside the skirts of
Widow O’Brien and succeed in breaking the
monotony of a Bouoicaultian character in which
an army of predecessors have been always copying
the original. Sheridan’s brogue strikes a variation
ou the ordinary stage Irish tone, and if his
humour isn’t unctuous it is certainly quaint. Out-
side Conn there are not many apologies for this
revival. Oily Deering and Docy Mainwaring are
worthy of Brunton’s scenery, Gracie Whiteford,
as Moya, smacks of variety show, and a few of
the others excite unkind remarks.

Anson is to receive a complimentary
fai’ewell testimonial (the fin de sihcle name for a
ben.) at Melbourne Bijou next Saturday afternoon
(30th). A crowded programme has been arranged,
and the interesting occasion will include the
presentation of an address to Anson, who intends
to change his address soon afterwards.
Fitzgerald Bros, have recently introduced
a “Paradox of Wonders” to Melbourne, in a
large tent near the Hibernian Hall, Swanston-
street. For three years the brethren in question
have been running: a circus round the less popu-
lated parts of Australia, picking up horses and
capital, and adding new wings to the tent as they
went along, and now they consider themselves in
a position to paralyse large cities. Their show
travels on the Australian Native ticket, and
claims to be superior to the swollen Yankee
article in its equine department, pure and simple.
Some of the ’osses and ponies (especially a
little nugget called Commodore) can do every-
thing except talk, and if they could talk they
would observe that they were born and educated
in Australia, and feel proud of the fact. One of
the boy-tumblers is a pure-bred aboriginal, and
the clowns come from Parramatta. Everybody
connected with this breezy enterprise is Austra-
lian, barring one or two performers, who feel
heartily ashamed of themselves, and are consult-
ing a clergyman with a view to getting born
again. The audiences are Australian. They are
also large and enthusiastic, and the star of Fitz-
gerald Bros, seems • to be in the ascendant and
likely to stay there.

The Bourke-street halls are doing pretty
well, the Athenaeum resounds with sacred
minstrelry, and the Waxworks feels very grateful
to Williams. Rotunda concerts, under the Siege
of Paris Cyclorama, have been added to the list of
other concerts at the Exhibition and elsewhere.
Altogether Melbourne is suffering from a rash of
side shows and the disease musn t be allowed to
go any further.

Marie Halton’s incidental song—“ One
Kiss anqong Three ” —was the big hit at Elton’s
farewell. She sang the last verse three times and
then she kissed Elton, whereupon the house rose
and cheered with such violence that the robust
angel was forced to come forward and kiss Billy
again and yet again. It is an odd fact that two or
three thousand intelligent human beings can be
driven frantic by the spectacle of anything
resembling a genuine spontaneous kiss on the
stage. The Halton “ bus ” bore an excellent air
of spontaneity, though it probably had been as
carefully thought out beforehand as Elton’s
speech. Now, the oration in question was so
obviously readied up for the occasion that it fell
very flat. William, too, had omitted to pop in a
spice of pathos. He didn’t choke or turn his
head away for an instant in order to hide his feel-
ings. It was a dry and chippy farewell, unworthy
of the experienced comedian, who in the excite-
ment of the moment forgot all about his uncon-
trollable sob. A farewell that doesn’t include a
muffled sob is much the same as “ Hamlet ” minus
the melancholy D.
At Poverty Point.
A new theatrical combination, which, it is said, will be
stronger than the old “ firm,” will shortly be announced
in Australia.
Elton visited Pentridge Stockade, where he saw a
member knapping blue diamonds, and this inmate re-
marked, “It’s my fust offence”—for he had been “in” ever
since Elton played in“ Erminie.” A new comer would
give the “ Cigale ” gag: “ Warm—very warm.”
Signor Foli, basso, is a tall, dark, long-haired man of the
Warwick Gainor type, and very much of the same stamp
of figure; broad-shouldered and deep-chested, indicating
the possession of lungs like blacksmith’s bellows.
Desperately insolvent Brisbane (Q.), in. a recent week
spent £3OOO with Sells’ Circus; over 40,000 persons
attended during its six days’ exhibition.
On the second night of “ Fedora,” at Melbourne Opera
House, Mrs. Bernard Beere brought young Otho Stuart
before the curtain and presented him with her vegetable
tributes in token of gratitude for his “ loyal support ” as
Ipanoff, vice Standing, resigned.
Billy Elton told the writer that he hopes to return to
Australia about Christmas, 1893, and may “manage”
himself.
Speaking of the acting of a new operetta, “ Donna
Luiza,” by Basil Hood and Walter Slaughter, it was
wittily said, the other day in London, that the ladies and
gentlemen concerned might have had Christian burial at
the time when the Catholic Church was most severe
against actors.
The “Cavalleria Rusticana" bubble has burst, and the
opera is a frost in Italy.
Charles Haw trey made £BO,OOO clear out of the
“ Private Secretary,” every penny of which he lost on
the turf.
Charles Haddon Chambers was named after the cele-
brated Spurgeon. Oughtn’t he to be a better boy ?
Fred. Want, late of Sydney, and Lord Carlow (Fred,
keeps up the Australian tradition and hooks on to the
peerage when lie can) recently appeared as the “ funny
men” at a kind of Christy Minstrel entertainment at
Nice.
Haddon Chambers, since the failure of “ The Honour-
able Herbert” at (he Vaudeville, is lying low. He is at
work on a new play, which he expects will eclipse any-
thing he has hitherto turned out. “The Idler ’-’ is doing
very" well in the provinces, where Charles Cartwright is
playing the part of Blank Cross.
Lottie Collins was, at latest, filling; London Gaiety with
the inevitable Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay. This, says our cor-
respondent, must be gall to Fred Leslie, whose hardest
efforts failed to make “Cinder Ellen” gee.
Signor Foli, the latest star musical arrival, says that
Hie Sydney Town Hall is the finest concert-ball in the
whole world, Then he somewhat unnecessarily explains
that he comes from the Land of Blame)'.
Elton has signed a contract with George Leitch Walker
for the acting of an opera-bouffe and a farcical comedy,
which Billy intends producing at the earliest opportunity
in London and in America. Of course Billy has back-
bacon parts in both.
K.The rival Melbourne concert entrepreneurs are cutting
each others’ throats.
Fitzgerald’s circus hits Melbourne hard. It is so strong
on the horsey, where Sells were so cruelly clipped. The
flier over 20 horses is unique. The right successors of
Malcolm, Ashton, and Burton have turned up.
“ Good parts make good actors.” A saying exemplified
when Guy Staunton, in Melbourne last week, so ably
replaced Standing as Charles Surface.
Leumane plays second or third fiddle in the Melbourne
“ Carmen.” What does a man care when he’s got a farm
and carters?—as Polonius says. Edwin Booth’s father,
the groat Junius Brutus, went market-gardening, and
fetched loads of cabbages into the city, when his admirers
would persuade him to go over to the theatre and act
King Dick.
The first exponents of “ Fedora ” in Melbourne were
the Majeronis. Majeroni carried the piece with ins fiery
Ipanoff. How Beere would have delighted to act with
him !
Councillor Bill levers, of Melbourne, has got into Par-
liament at last. Everyone thought he’d have been Mayor
first. Barry Sullivan offered him a theatrical engagement
after his performance of Don Jose, in “Maritana,” to
the Don Ccesar of the late Michael Moloney, of Sydney,
brother of Dr. Pat. Moloney and attorney Moloney.
Preparations are busy at Melbourne Opera House for
Lonnen and the Gaiety Burlesque Troupe.
Sheridan launches on the Melbourne stage a good team
of Australian Thespians, supporting him as the Shaugh-
raun. Ireland, Deering, Charley Brown, and ever so
many others burnish out as good (and sober) a cast as
Johnny need have in his eye.
Herbert Standing went down to Woodend, the rura
vice regal district, to recruit his health.
Proceedings up to date in the Melba divorce-case shows
that H.R.H. Duke of Orleans carries too many legal guns
for the injured husband.
d One-man-one-billet Bland Holt has, we understand,
engaged 25 men of the Permanent Artillery as supers in
the “ Trumpet Call.”
The Bernard-Beere can, and does, talk and laugh,
bright as you like, after her biggest efforts—" Fedora,”
for instance. A pleasant lady, withal.
At the Deeming inquest somebody mistook a well-
known portly stage Adonis for the prisoner, and pro-
ceeded to draw attention to the brutal ferocity of his
countenance, and the murderous expression of his lower
jaw. He also pointed out that the actor was a misshapen
dwarf, and a distinct retrogression to a lower type of
humanity. His auditors obviously believed him ;in fact,
not one of them seemed to notice any discrepancy what-
soever. Even the fact that Adonis was obviously about
six feet high made not the slightest difference. They
were told that he was Deeming, and being told that they
recognised him at once.
Just fancy a premiere dansense bearing the name o*
Mary Duggan—and dancing under it!
A chorus of curates is one of the features of the new
comic opera, “The Vicar of Bray,” just produced in
London. There is not a single play, not even including
the “ Private Secretary ” in which the Anglican Church is
so burlesqued.
Conjuror Hereat, interviewed in London, says lie was a
Melbourne reporter for five years. First practised ven-
triloquism in the illustrious County Court! Here’s a
name to bracket with the illustrious Curly, Jimmy Hogan,
Travelled Smythe, and Jimmy Thomson. Who on earth
was he ?
Can anyone tell Tub Bulletin' the whereabouts of the
Opera Co, managed by Pemberton E. Willard, which
sometime ago left Australia for China and the East? The
locale of Heller’s Odds and Ends Co. is also enquired for.
The fiery Snazelle at latest was doing well at Dunedin.
On his first night an inopportune whistle from one
of the audience enraged him ; whereupon The S. began a
lecture ou blackguardism, larrikins and too much whisky,
and talked about throwing people out. In an explanation
arising out of some press criticisms, Snazelle says that
not knowing how Maoriland audiences differed from some
he had met in Australia, “ where the foul larrikin sat with
a stolid, putrid, heer-sodden face with about as much
expression as a stone dog, in the presence of anything
hisrh-class,” he had anticipated that the offending
whistle heralded trouble, which he determined to nip in
the hud.
Tire Myra Kemble Co. have been doing splendid busi-
ness in Maoriland.
B. R. Wise, M.L.A., (N.S.W.) is quoted
as authority for the statement that Cardinal
Moran “has privately instructed his clergy to
refuse tire rites of the Church to Catholics who
have joined Good Templar, Rachabite, Oddfellow,
Forester, &c., societies.”
Professor Anderson Stuart has been lec-
turing to Sydney Women’s Suffrage Association
on “Some Points in connection with the Throat.”
It is rumoured that some one will shortly lecture
the association on “Some Points in connection
with the Tongue.”
In the Queensland “ anti-hasty-legisla-
tion ” Chamber Billy Brooke’s voice alone rang
out against the Kanaka Bill. “I am not going
into details now,” said he, “ because it will all
come on over again, and the next time it willcome
with a very ugly rush, I can assure you.”
Mr. “Jack” Want, Q.C., is seriously ill.
As a consequence, the case of Herbert Salwey,
solicitor, accused of false pretences, involving a
very large amount, has been postponed. By the
way how is that so serious a charge as that pre-
ferred against Mr. Salwey is being tried at Sydney
Quarter Sessions ?
In answer to an enquiry, Dr. Maurice
O’Connor, medical officer of Darlinghurst (Syd-
ney), states that Deeming (Williams) was treated
for epileptic fits while confined in the prison
hospital some years ago. Epilepsy means brain-
disease : brain-disease generally means intermit-
tent mental alienation.
Deeming, The Bulletin hears, is develop-
ing no specific mental symptom. He is morbid in
the extreme, hardly speaks to a soul, eats and
sleeps well, and, for the rest, sits back in his cell
and grins the whole day long. His confessions
are but a small sheet or two, and probably contain
admissions of all of the Whitechapel murders and
the other big crimes of this century,
John Deniff (lately a publican and store-
keeper in the Cobar district, N.S.W.) and P.
M‘Dermott (a trusted working jeweller), who,
about two months ago, were sentenced respec-
tively to two years and eighteeen months upon a
Dubbo verdict of having robbed a vagrant, drunken
swagman of =£Bo, were released from Darling-
burst prison on Saturday, it having been dis-
covered in the meantime that the prosecutor had
never had any money to lose. Mrs. Deniff died
within five weeks of her husband’s imprisonment,
and Deniff's own health has been so rudely shaken
that he appears to be already past cure.
Hon. A. J. Thynne, Lieut.-Colonel in the
Queensland volunteer forces, has resigned in order
to more forcibly show his objection to the report
made by Colonel French animadverting on the
discipline of the volunteer forces. Thynne
replied to the report and forwarded his letter
through Commandant Owen who, however,
refused to pass it on to the Governor, This is the
same individual who, without waiting to set foot in
the province, and in utter official ignorance of the
circumstances of the case, wired from Adelaide
expressing his approval of the work done by the
Defence Force officers in the Central district
during the late labour troubles ? Thynne’s resigna-
tion will bring matters to a head both as regards
Colonel French’s report and the position taken up
by the nabob who succeeded hiin.
The Wild-Cat Column.
Sydney Daily Telegraph publishes an interview
with Mr, Hagg, smelting-works manager, from the Tas-
manian silver-fields, in which he expressed surprise that
Sydney had held aloof from it. The fact is that the repre
sentative Sydney men who went there over a year ago did
not go into ecstacies over Zeehan and Dundas. They were
emerging from their own mad silver boom and saw tilings
being repeated in Tasmania with wonderful exactitude.
Sydney was warned in good time. It was Tasmania’s
maiden silver boom, and the locals went mad over it.
Those who knew something about such matters saw that
their interests lay in fanning the boom. Little or no
money is made by condemnation. The writer was in
Hobart and Launceston in the zenith of the boom when
syndicates and companies of £lOO,OOO capital were formed
every day and barren blocks of ground had a market
value of thousands. With what results Mr. Hogg omits
to mention. It burst a big bank, it has robbed inno-
cenrly-ignorant people of their fortunes, half-ruined hun-
dreds of others, and business throughout the whole island
is stagnant. Sydney (unlike Melbourne) was never in it,
for which it should be everlastingly thankful. Had the
Tasmanian people been in the N.S.W. silver-boom to any
extent they would have been sane enough to escape tbo
effects of their own.

The Charters Towers shareholders in the Victory
mine, while not particularly objecting to the management
of the property being in Sydney, insist that they should
not be at a disadvantage in the publication of news. They
also ask that their dividends shall be paid free of exchange
on Sydney—an anomaly, certainly. It is possible to think
that, with the mine and miners there, they should allow
the Sydney contingent to get ahead of them in anything
—not much. However, Buckland, who attended the
meeting, promised an equal start in the race from latest
information.

Ravenswood, Q., has a pretty smart mining man
in one W. H. Parish, who long back let daylight into
Tarangaba, and wrote to the Premier of Queensland,
denouncing the Last Call as a swindle long before it was
generally admitted to be one. Parish is also a satirical
rogue, who writes thus of “ thermal springs ” : “ Whilst
such springs heave up precious metals, Professor Jack’s
name will be deified ; if otherwise, the deification will go
lame. I see they have one at the Last Call, but until
Professor Jack passes it as one, I shall think Warden
Gibson is putting on jam. It shows what a magnificent
future there is in store for Australia, when its thermal
springs heave up precious metals that are absent in all
the thermal springs of the old and new worlds.”

Because The Bulletin has spoken ill of Para-
bola, lots of stockholders believe we are wrong. No
doubt they do, and we are sorry—for them. After all,
the market is the only gauge of the value of a mine—in-
asmuch as all tilings are only worth what they will sell for.
When the writer said in effect “ beware of Pambula shares
generally,” they were more than double their present
price. Here is an extract from the late underground
manager of the Pambula G.M. Co. The shaft sunk on
the lode will he out of the Co.’s ground in a little over 200
feet in depth as the reef underlays 2 feet in C. There is
no payable gold even in the South end of the shaft, and I
defy anyone to say that there are 20 tons of good ore left in
tlie mine. The only bit of payable ore is close to Faulk-
ner’s boundary, and the shaft is within a few feet of it.
The fact is, the mine lias a little shoot of gold-bearing
stone about 8 or 10 feet long, and I should not be sur-
prised if it lea\es the shaft in a very few feel more sink-
ing.” This was written over a month ago, and there is
too much reason to think that (he prediction of the gold-
bearing ore completely leaving the shaft has already
been fulfilled.

Dear Bulletin, —He yoiu paragraph on the
Delegate Sluicing Co. operating on the Nelbothery table-
land. I prospected the ground referred to for ten days
in 1873, and sent the result of my washings together with
a report to mining men of experience in Melbourne, who
at that time did not think the prospects good enough.
Two grains to the yard is my estimate of the yield, except
two small patches that may go half-a-pennyweight; and
the whole stuff from the surface to the bed-rock is quartz
gravel, with ironstone veins, and a thin coating of adhe-
sive clay binding the whole mass. However, if the com-
pany raise the water on to the high land east of the
ground to be worked, and get pressure enough, they may
be able to shift the ground at a profit, as their tail-race
fall is perfect without costing them one shilling.—Yours,
J.J.

The Crushed Dog mine reports a good reef
and the possession of a good dam site. The Crushed Dog
is a no-liability concern. We have heard of the Dead Cow
Creek, the Jackass Flat, the Wattle Bark Alluvial, and
the Dead Horse Gully Proprietary, hut the Crushed Dog
is new to us; nevertheless, we wish it success, so that
we may have a chance of buying from, say, good Joseph
Palmer—who hates gambling, except of the Stock
Exchange brand—looo Crushed Dogs, at Is. Under any
circumstances paid-up Crushed Dogs would he preferable
to contributing Crushed Dogs, or even Crushed Dog
pups. If successful, we shall have Extended Crushed
Dogs, Great Extended Crushed Dogs, The Crushed Dog
East and West. London, too, will want a Crushed Dog,
with an influential hoard, including the Earl of Dogberry,
as chairman of the Anglo Extended Crushed Dog Limited
Co. Also, above all, the writer trusts that, at any rate,
the Crushed Dog is true to name. There is something in
that, for it mines were all true to name there would be
more “ Wild Cats” than anything else in N.S.W.

The first return from Mount Stewart silver-
mine gives an average of some 9oz. silver and about five
per cent, lead to the ton of ore—insufficient to covet
working expenses—so the shares have fallen to half the
amount they were when the public were advised from a
source of which they must be heartily sick to buy them.
Several correspondents have reminded us of our own
warning note.
# #- *
A correspondent says we are not “mathemati-
cally correct in our remarks on the Marvel mire at Dal-
n'.orton. We hope not. He says the reef is enclosed in a
rock formation of a character highly favourable to Ilia-*
continuance of the reef and gold to unfathomable depths
However, we prefer adhering to the opinion of a mine the
writer knows to changing it for that of a man he knows
not.

Pambula will, perhaps, after all, come out all
right. The correspondent reports again—there have been
several assurances—that a certain horse-whip down there
is “ working satisfactorily.” True, it would be reassuring
to hear that the horse itself had escaped the “ pink-eye,”
that the horse-boy had not struck for higher wages, or
that the cowhide bucket had not suffered much from wear
and tear, but all this information will probably come in
due course. Shareholders should he patient, not glutton-
ous, for these important facts.

Dear Bulletin, —The mystery of the Last Call
salting is capable of solution. The mine had no true vein
formation, hut a series of comparatively narrow leaders
of moist and muddy decomposed calc—it my memory
fails not. Well, such stuff is as soft as pea-soup, and can
he raked out to a great depth witli a long shovel, further
lengthened with a pole. When cut, it could he sailed
and replaced, without much altering its appearance,
especially if a quantity of connecting rock were blasted
out with it.—F.O.B.V.

Sir Bryan O’Loghlen was once examining
an Irish witness in a land-purchase ease, and asked
him if he remembered the year in which the
transaction took place. At first the -witness could
not remember, but, upon being pressed, recollected
that it was “ the year of Our Lord, as I saw it on

Jerome K. Jerome is writing “ novel
notes” for the Argus. The notes are chiefly
novel from their length and must be regarded a"s
painfully-prolonged blather. Many “humourists”
have appeared in the Argus, but one and all
needed a severe course of training in a “boiling-
down” establishment.
Deeming’s alias “ Williams ” is apparently
derived from the name of Mr. Williams, his Rock-
hampton employer; while as to his alias “Baron
Swanston,” the Swanston probably comes from
Swanston-street, Melbourne, while the “Baron”
is adapted from the name of Mr. Baron Marks,
his landlord at Rainhill.
Graham Berry has taken a big house in a
big terrace, formerly occupied by Bryan
O’Loghlen, Q.C., in Fitzroy street, St. Kiida,
opposite the home of Premier Shiels, and near the

“please knock as the bell does not ring.” It will
probably be repaired by the time “the cat

Dr. Embling, who opposed Turner for St.

piece of egotism that was “nuts” to the multi-

Questioned as to his meaning in referring

man hardly knows himself what the phrase meant,
He probably used it because it struck him as
melodious.

Later, he got a billet with the Pahang Corpora-

Thomas Hanson, who polled 20 votes in all
for Emerald Hill (Melbourne) is the eccentric old
ex-grazier who formerly tried his horny hand at
theatrical management. His first attempt was at
the Alexandra, where he produced, amongst other
novelties, a drama of back-blocks life which in-
cluded the shearing of a sheep upon the staeo and
ran for two consecutive nights. Later on the
reckless Hanson went in for comic opera and old
comedy at the Bijou. He was wont to dismiss
applicants for engagements in his company with
the pathetic remark that he already had a great
many relatives who wanted to act. The 20 electors
who rallied round Hanson at the poll were pre-
sumably the male portion of his family connection.
The late Mr. Wilson, of Wilson .and
Mackinnon, proprietors of the Argus, had a
favourite nephew for whom he was minded to do
something good. So in his will he directed that
young Wilson, who had been a bit of a sport at
Oxford, should come in to a share in the Argus,
as soon as certain trustees passed him as “quali-
fied ” to take part in the councils of that mighty
organ. Wilson became a “journalistic pupil ”in
a London newspaper office and was high in favour
amongst his colleagues. He had a pretty taste in
horse and dog flesh, and attained some distinction
through being presented at a tripe-supper at “ the
Haunch of Venison,” with a leather medal to mark
the general appreciation of his brindled bull pup.
But six months of “subbing ” and of translating
foreign telegrams proved too much for Wilson,
and one clay he went out to “ Ye Olde Cheshire
Cheese ” for luncheon and did not return again.

The Death of Jim’s Child.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
H e wasaswagmaa— don’t stop here. Of course,
as I say, he was a swagman, yet it doesn’t neces-
sarily follow that he got bushed going to the out-
station and that his remains were found two years
afterwards prone on a scorching plain beneath a
brazen sky, with his water bag, billy, the bones of
his faithful dog and other things lying around him
in orderly disorder. He also had a strange habit
of not coming home drunk and falling into his
camp-fire and sizzling away. I will also state here
to prevent surprise or disappointment further on,
that he never lost his life trying to save a mate
from drowning in the Warrego. No; he was
simply one of those few mysterious men who go
about with a swag looking for work and praying
they will get it. He had been there two months,
camped down the gully half-a-mile from my tent.
There was a lot of us about there, all cutting fire-
wood at Gs. a cord. Jim didn’t seem a bad sort,
only he was one of those men who know everything
and everybody. People of that sort sometimes
make you feel tired.
# * #
One cold, wet, drizzling day in August,
somewhere about four p.m., Jim came up to my
camp. I could see there was something wrong,
though he tried hard to appear calm and collected.
He had received a telegram that day stating that
his little son was dying in Melbourne; One of the
wood-carters had just brought the telegram out, so
he was on his way to the railway-station to catch
the seven o’clock train for Melbourne.
| | After a few moments’ silence, a thought seemed
to strike him, and, suddenly arousing himself, he
exclaimed :
“Well, Billy, you haven’t treated me bad since
I’ve been here, and it’s not likely I’ll be back, so
you might as well have that tent of mine.”
“ Ivio, Jim,” I said ; “ I wouldn’t take it without
giving something for it. Besides, there’s those
two axes and that six-foot saw of yours. What
about them ?”
I felt rather liberal just then, as we had all got
paid up that day, and, besides, I knew Jim hadn’t
much to draw. Jim sat looking into the fire in a
dreamy sort of way. Poor old Jim ! I think I see
him yet! Those great, big, blue eyes staring into
the fire. I wonder where old Jim is now?
‘‘Yes,” he said, “I didn’t think of them, but
111 tell you what I’ll do, Billy. You can have
the lot—saw, axes, tent and wedges, for 155.”
Now, here was a chance to give a mate a lift
and make a good bargain at the same time, for I
knew the things to be worth at least £2.
Jim took the money mechanically, shook hands
in a dazed sort of way, and disappeared in the
fast gathering gloom in the direction of therailway-
station. Then I swung the William over the fire,
ruminating on the uncertainty of human life and
tlie fickleness of human happiness.
“ Poor old Jim,” I thought, “ he is one of those
swagmen who don’t have a continual picnic.”
. I must admit l turned in that night with a feel-
ing of satisfaction at the bargain I had made.
Next morning, Tom Hill came in just as I was
slicing some onions into the frying-pan along with
the chops. He wanted to know if Jim’s tent had
been knocked about much, as he hadn't seen it
for a fortnight, dim had called at his tent on his
way to the station. Had just received a telegram,
&c., &e. Anyhow, Tom had bought tent and
tools for .£l. During the conference that followed
the onions and chops suffered terribly. We
finally agreed to divide the things as nearly as we
could.
We had just finished arbitrating over the
wedges when we sighted Jim’s camp. There
was no sign of tent or tools there. While we stood
looking at the deserted establishment, vao-nul
wondering how Jim would stand the blow in ....
the child died, the butcher and baker who served
the camps both pulled up their carts and
over the log fence. ‘ nfi
They were on the same errand. The butehe
had met Jim going in with his swag, and tl *
baker had collared him at the station. J us t 6
the publican’s son rode up to the fence n.,!!
remarked: aci
“ Yes, old Jim’s cleared. Got a telegram e to
he brought his things in last night and the nla
man gave him 255. for them, but we found th‘
morning that he’d got them all on tick at t,
store. People ought to be more careful y 6
long ! ” *ioo
After a silence that could have been heard
many, many miles away, we conversed, but on?
language was only fit for Parliament.
BOILING BILLY.
Dear Bulletin,— ln the capital city (orvil-
lage) of one of the_ territorial divisions of one of
the latest paste-imitations in the “ Kerrown of
Berritain’s gerlory I’ll not be more specific-,
the whole of the working Government were quifl
lately on a howling drunk, from the Resident Boss
down to the most useless swell clerk exnatreioiu
for his family’s good. They drank all the liquor
at the Government bungalow, leaving not a thim
bleful on which to sober up. When the fi er v
serpents with green eyes commenced to bristle-un
their several hairs, and the whole crowd had
palpitating toads in their flesh, a happy insnira'
tion invaded the loosened imagination of the boss'
whose eyes were looking out round his ears. Ho
remembered that there was in bond at the Custom
House a cask of rum, the property of a private
settler, and he staggered for it with the genius" of
delirium. Now, that Custom House is a two-
storeyed building, and composite in scope. The
upper-storey is the bonded store, and the ground-
floor is the local gaol. On this particular day
a prisoner languished in the cell, awaiting the
sobriety of the Administration. The boss fell up
stairs somehow, gimlet in hand, and spiled the keg
drawing off a bucketful of rum in which he pm!
sently buried his bewildered head. He was too
overcome with his own happiness to be able to
caulk up the aperture, so he recklessly slid, leav-
ing the dark nectar flowing. It trickled and
soaked into the floor, and aho streamed through a
crack into the locloup below. Next day the
prisoner, on being visited, was found as drunk as
a professional pugilist, standing squarely on his
back and chivvying imaginary enemies in five
different dialects, with two bootfltls of rttm by his
side in readiness for future necessities. The cask
upstairs was nearly empty. All the same, the
Collector of Customs, who had, of course, been on
the spree, on behalf of Her Gracious Majesty
(here’s luck to her!), insisted on receiving full
duty on the entire quantity of rum originally
placed in bond, before he would restore the pint
or two of balance to the owner, who, on his part
being also at his last gasp for a corpse-galvaniser’
paid up for his soul’s sake. That Administration
can’t now keep that prisoner long out of the lock-
up, but he complains that the mysterious cataract
of blessing does not repeat itself.'—Yours, Sama.
A Universal Despotism.
During the past ten years the spirit of national
freedom has extended its radical lines to all points
of the earth’s circumference, and everywhere the
aim and end has been upward and onward to the
haven of self-government, With what terrible
import then comes the news that the Great-White
Czar—that paradox of northern Europe who
orders the extinction of millions of subjects while
he himself trembles at the unarmed nihilist—has
determined to restore serfdom in the provinces of
Samara and Saratoff, thus depriving 5 millions of
the people of the little liberty they previously
possessed. _ This happens too when the Eussian
peasantry is suffering a famine, the details and
makeshifts of which read like an account of the
plague in London or a graphic description of the
sufferings of the Je Ws dui mg the siege of Jerusaletti*
Bo at the will of a despotic crank the universe is
to be put back 200 years and Eussia is to have the
vassalage and serfdom that Germany abolished
centuries ago.
There is, however, a greater despot than the
Czar a despot who respects neither person, time,
nor place—who sits, not on every throne, but
above it—a despot of kings—a king, who is not
the ordinary figure-head—but a living and des-
tructive Entity. This despot is Disease, and his
kingdom is the whole uwld. This autocrat seems
to work chiefly upon the kidneys and livers of
mankind, and by disordering those organs causes
the dissemination of uric acid poison in that vital
element—the blood. The victims suffer almost
inconceivable torments from numerous symptoms
which are apparently distinct, but in reality are
dependent complaints, and if a remedy is not
speedily found they finally succumb, as is told us,
to heart disease, paralysis, apoplexy, pneumonia
and other causes, while the whole truth is, they
die from the effects of urea and uric acid poison,
Warner’s Bafe Cure is the only specific yet disc
covered for the extermination of this foe to the
peace and welfare of our race, It goes direct to
the primal cause and never fails if taken in time
and according to directions.

Parkes is understood to bo lying low oft
the weather-bow, in expectation of changes m the
S W. Ministerial personnel and programme.
Bast Melbourne is practically without
representation in Parliament. Zoxand Prank
Stuart are unanimous m next to nothing at all.
Emerald Hill (Melbourne) has failed to
onnreciate the recreant David Gaunson in his Tory
Sup, and has re-elected T. Smith, an unassum-
ing hatter. 1
The defeat of ex - Postmaster - Genera 1
twham for Pott Melbourne means that Swallow
Ar iel’g Sandridge biscuit-factory no longer
SLs the local poll.
The chief feature of the late part-session
nf the Bananaland Parliament was drunkenness in
the forum. That characteristic out-blackguarded
even the Kanaka boom.
No new member can possibly fill the boots
nf Colonel Smith, at last rejected for Ballarat.
We say this just to get ahead of other people, as
it is sure to be in great demand.
A piece of Victorian legislation prohibits
cabs being engaged bv election candidates. The
ruse adopted is for the cabby to volunteer gratui-
tously, getting a douceur afterwards,
Mr. W. T. Coonan, solicitor, threatens to
contest the vacant Bogan (N.S.W.), seat Mr.
W. T. Coonan, solicitor, is not wanted in the
N.S.W. Parliament any more for the next 25
years at least.
South Australia proceeds to import Indian
'Coolies to the Northern Territory; West Aus-
tralia swallows shoals of Chinese ; North Queens-
land completes the trinity of slave-states, and sows
the seeds of a harvest of civil war.
Gladstone is opposed to granting female
suffrage at present, and says he wants to hear the
matter further discussed before committing him-
self to a definite opinion. Perhaps he wishes to
sec the Englishmen fully enfranchised first.
Should Chief Justice Lilley again descend
itlto the political arena and proceed to load a
fiopilhr party; Premier Griffith will probably clou
the ermine as Chief Justice; He must be weary
of eternally swallowing his own political Vomits;
Carington looks for an earldom at the
hands of the Liberals when they return to
power. He was the instigator of 1 aikes s
Federation trip to Brisbane three years ago.
Parkes is never original—but where did Carington
get the idea ?
From the speech of a Victorian candi-
date;—“The time, gentlemen, has arriven—the
time, I say, have arrived—the-the —the period
are come-^-when—when there oughter be mutual
concessions, and these mutual concessions oughter
be on both sides.”
Hopeless is the rift between the “ Old
Pioneers,” in the Melbourne Trades Hall, and the
new labour school, of Hancock and
Actually there were Rival Petes on Bight Hour
Day, but as the Old Side is all on one side, it must
inevitably be beaten.
Said the defeated Hancock, speaking to
his late constituents after the declaration of the
poll: “Now that lam cast out, it is a comfort to
tad to remember that the British investor will at
once lend the country all the millions it wants,
cheerfully, and no questions asked.”
The electors of Collingwood (Melbourne)
elected Butcher Wilkins and rejected Labour-
Leader Hancock, because the former recently gave
rations of meat to the unemployed. Natheless, the
Collingwood voters have dropped the substance
for the shadow—or, let us say, the meat for the
bone.
The Victorian labour candidates made a
big mistake in putting up more than one candidate
wherever there were two seats vacant. This was
particularly noticeable at East Bourke and
Pitzroy, where, had one labour man been put up
in each case, he must, on the figures, inevitably
have been at the top of the poll.
Cantankerous, caustic, vitriolic, able
Edward Langton ineffectually challenged Punch
M'Kinley for Toorak. In the M’Culloch time
Langton was the Conservative bull-fighter and
bear-baiter, but did not come well out of it in
substantial reward, for he is only an accountant,
always poor, as Toorakia reckons.
Premier Griffith once replied to a Parlia-
mentary question that Imperial laws interfered
with the deportation from Queensland of time-
expired Kanakas. So that, by Griffith’s own
admission, the allegation that Polynesian labour is
a temporary expedient, is untrue. When the
Kanaka is once admitted, he comes to stay.
Alf. Deakin (who is to help in defending
Deeming, by the way) safely holds his seat for
Essendon and Elemington by a majority of 1173
above his rival Liberal, Morris. The Age the
other day spoke of Deakin as the Victorian
Assembly’s “best speaker and brightest intellect.”
David Syme does sometimes lickspittle his staff.
Chief Justice Lilley might, under the
present Queensland law, have voted in the recent
Bulimba election had he claimed as an elector
possessing property there, but he has declared his
fixed and unalterable principle to be “ one person
one vote, and no more.” Fancy Sir Thomas
Swellbug abjuring any flukey chances a prejudicial
law gave him !
The so-called-“revolt” against the Labour-
party in N.S. W. is against certain of the men, pot
against the political principles they profess. This
will be fully seen, when one of these days Sir
Charles Lilley, of Queensland, comes down and
talks One-man-one-vote and flit-footed Republi-
canism to the citizens of Sydney in the great
Centennial Hall.
SO UNLIKE HIM.
OLD SWELL (a rascally rake, to young matron, in a pause of the conversation): “And I married
her.”
SHE (out loud): “Oh, that was very honorable of you.”
Premier Playford, of S.A., while travel-
ling round booming Indian nigger-labour in the
Northern Territory, has run over and killed a
Chinaman. It is the one bright feature in jus
career, but the worst of it is that S. A. may give
him a big majority at next election because he
killed that. Chinaman, and having got in he may
never kill any more.
London Standard says that “ the ill-
success of the One-man-one-vote principle (in
Victoria) will probably cause the question to
subside.’ and “declares that Berry is the most
influential political figure in Victoria.” this is
reprinted merely as a sample of the chronic ana
hopeless ignorance of Australian affairs displayed
by the “ best-informed ” English newspapers.
A well-informed Melbourne correspondent
wrote us beforehand as to how wretchedly the
elections would be bungled, in regard to the
Labour-vote. Hancock was in such a stew oyer
quaky Colling wood, his own constituency (which
rejected him) that he had no fag end of his mind to
bestow on anywhere else, and Trenwith was
absorbed in trying to get himself in for Richmond.
Dr. Rose, the mesmeric gentleman who
used to swap nightgowns with the baker’s wife,
did a good turn for North Melbourne. He
obtained, with the sweet assistance of lady
canvassers, enough votes to let labour candidate
Wyllie pop in by a majority of 25 over Laurens.
Decent, dreary old Laurens will be missed m the
’Ouse, for he was a harmless sedative to take after
dinner.
“ Anglo-Auatralian,” ot the European
Mail, says that any man who refused to stand
and take off his hat in an Australian theatre
while “ God Save the Queen ” was played, would
be roughly handled. This consoles him for record*
ing that, even on the most loyal estimate, only
two-thirds of the audience in last Drury Lane
Pantomime pit stood up or took off their hats for
the National Anthem.
Chief Justice Lilley (Q.) has earned the
hate and aroused the rage of the Kanakophilo
Tories of Bananaland, because he had the grit to
write like this to a parliamentary candidate :
I hope to live to sec a brave, wise, and resolute band of
white native Australians moving on towards nationhood ,
revering all that is good in the institutions of the mother
lands of their ancestors, but determined to rule their own
country.
The story of the suspension of the Vic-
torian Railway Commissioners can be briefly told.
On March 2, Minister Wheeler requested those
functionaries to propose in writing a scheme by
which the expenditure of the department could be
reduced bv <£loo,ooo, and the revenue increased
by £160,000 a year.” Speight & Co. fell back m
their chairs and roared with laughter, and Wheeler
recommended their immediate suspension for in-
competence. ’
Melbourne Age, in an article on the
glorious spread of the British Empire, complains
that the French, by their invasion of Dahomey,
are “ intruding into regions where the inhabitants
do not want their presence.” Just so. And if
England had never intruded where the inhabitants
didn’t want her presence, Victoria’s empire to-day
would be bounded by Scotland on the north,
Wales on the west, and the sea on the othe r
two sides, and a train would rush you right
through her dominions in eight hours.
Rev. VV. Moore (Congregational), of
Bundaberg (Q.), in the best letter which has yet
been published on the Kanaka question, denounces
the South Sea nigger traffic as immoral, on the
ground that it violates the fundamental law of
human society. 41 The recruiter takes the youth,
the flower of the island, in the proportion of 13
men to 1 woman. This proportion is based on the
fact that we have in this district 2883 Kanakas,
2680 males and 203 females ; that is to say, there
are no less than 2477 men without wives.”
Australia’s new and expensive armoured
coffin-ship, Tauranga, has begun to break up
already. She is visiting Sydney to have new
decks put in, the original ones having given out
after a few months’ service. Any muscular indi-
vidual with a good-siml axe could break up the
Tauranga or any other of the fleet if he went at
her with anything like vigour, but it is hoped that,
by judicious patching and a careful avoidance of
rough weather, the Scarecrow Armada may hang
together long enough to collect a few more annual
subsidies from this bleeding country.
Premier Shiels played a huge election
joke on his Tory enemies. In some occult way, it
was noised abroad prematurely that the elections
were to be held on Friday, 22nd April. I lie
purse-fat Is ational Ass. rushed all the principal
halls in all the electorates, and engaged them in
advance for Thursday night, April 21. Then the
word was secretly passed round amongst the
f aithful, and the Liberal candidates engaged those
halls for Tuesday, April 19. After which, Shiela
and his cabinet decided that Wednesday, April
20, was the most convenient day for the elections.
The Tories were thus “let in” for the rent of a
hundred halls.
Greater Britain, in the course of a plea
for Freetrade, makes this memorable announce-
ment: “In America, where wages are highest,
the average cost of production of many staple
articles is lowest; and if that country once
adopted a Freetrade policy it would he still more
lessened .” What a reckless shooting at the goose
which lays the golden eggs ! If wages are highest
and the cost to the consumer is lowest, who on
earth wants to take any risks on the strength of
anybody’s unsupported assertion that, by abolish-
ing the system which made wages high and prices
low, wages will straightway become still higher
and prices yet lower.
Thus a Brisbane preacher :
They were entering into a great responsibility with the
Kanaka labour scheme, and they had better not touch it
if chey did not intend to take God into it.
And as he finally gave his decision in favour of
the slave-trade, he evidently decided to “take
God into it.” Think of the blasphemy of it;
think also how it would look on the firm’s brass
plate—“lStiggins and God, slave-drivers and
dealers in human flesh.” Truly, the Christian
parson doesn’t think much of his Deity. Even
the Chinaman, if he wanted to go into a garbage
heap, wouldn’t take his Joss along with him for
fear lie would get smudged.
The Bulletin has just again read the
published list of the N.S. W. bogus-“ National ”
Association’s numerous committee. It cannot see
thereon the name of anyone whose material
interests are not bound up with the capitalist
rather than with those of the wage-earner, nor
does it recognise in the list the name of anyone
who is not an avowed Foreign-trader. This tends
to bear out The Bulletin's contentions. (1) The
N.S.W. National Ass. is only the old defunct
N.S.W. “Freetrade and Liberal” Association
under a new and more specious name; (2)
Whether logically or illogically, the Freetrade
party in Australia is and always has been the
Tory party.
Graham Berry, who now represents in the
Victorian Parliament East Bonrke Boroughs, the
seat made historic by Richard Heales and George
Higinbotham, first entered Parliament by a
fluke. In June 1861 a vacancy occurred for East
Melbourne. Patrick O’Brien and Edward Cohen
were candidates. The nomination was to take
place on July 3rd. Meanwhile, Governor Barkly
promised Heales a dissolution when certain
measures then passing should be completed.
O’Brien and Cohen agreed that there should be no
contest, and at the nomination proposed and
seconded Charles Hobson Ebden (disgustingly
rich), then in England. D’Arcy, a publican, not
wishing a walk over, then proposed Graham
Berry, at that moment standing on the pavement
in front of the hustings. lie was duly seconded, the
Ebden people declined to call for a poll, and
Berry was declared elected. That night he took
bis seat, introduced by Richard Heales. Next
day the House was adjourned by proclamation,
and eight days afterwards dissolved. He after-
wards stood (and was returned) for Collingvvood.
“ The Primate, Dr. Saumarez Smith, and
Bishop Barlow, had a most cordial reception at
Cairns on Thursday night. Referring to the
question of Kanaka labour, the Primate said that
he saw no objection to it provided the Government
regulations were properly carried out.” —Daily
Paper—
Saumarez Smith—that man of pith,
Our dear, beloved Primate —
Has none away (but not lo slay)
Unto a wanner climate.
The cabby's horse is sad, of course.
It mourns him, out and in yard,
For S.S. scoots (o taste the fruits
From out his neighbour’s vineyard.
Saumarez Smith, in comp’ny with
His friend (not Billee) Barlow,
Observes, with pain, that sugarcane

What People Say.
P. J. WALLACE, Esq., KANGAROO
VALLEY, N.S.W.,
Writes: “Dear Sir,—l have much pleasure in
hearing witness to the great value of Clements
Tonic in cases of Lassitude, Nervousness, and
Constitutional Debility generally. For more than
twelve months I was a martyr to extreme lassitude,
loss of appetite, sleeplessness and their concomit-
ant train of physical troubles, so much so that I
feared I should have to abandon my profession as
a journalist, writing being particularly irksome
and laborious to me. I tried several advertised
tonics (?) with little or no good result, and began
to think my case beyond the power of medicine to
cure. However, seeing your tonic advertised in
some of my exchanges, I concluded to try it as a
“ dernier rcssort,” and I am pleased to say that
the result was most satisfactory. After taking
one bottle I found my appetite much improved ; I
could sleep more soundly, and felt refreshed next
morning. I continued the medicine, taking in all
six large bottles, and gradually all my distressing
symptoms disappeared. I now feel myself stronger
than ever, and as near perfect health as a man
who has to bear the strain of constant literary
work can expect to be. I can confidently recom-
mend Clements Tonic to all persons suffering from
loss of nerve force through sickness or mental
over work, and am most happy to support my
testimony with my signature, —And remain dear
sh Yours faithfully, P. Jefferson Wallace,
Editor and Proprietor Kangaroo Vallei
Pioneer.”

Society
The Bulletin, in one recent week,
received no less than five enquiries from widely-
separated localities concerning the whereabouts of
male members of the theatrical profession. The
enquiries in each case emanated from the wife of
one of the said males, who alleges that he has
deserted her. Moral for girls : Always marry an
actor.

Lady Jersey, having been last year greeted
by some graceful wits of the Sydney University
as “old girl,” or something like that, did not
attend this year’s commemoration —at which, by
the way, there were no speeches. The under-
graduates’ song, “The Undergrad, of Sydney,”
medleyed to a rollicking operatic air, although
only a parody, was probably the best bit of verse
that has yet come out of the Sydney University.
The author should certainly be crowned with a
wreath of spring-onions at the very least.
• « *
Rev. Father M'Kernan, parish priest, late
of Ravenswood (Q.), has turned his back upon the
Pope, and is now lecturing under the cegis of the
Sydney Orangemen. We shan’t wonder if ere the
good father has had much experience of the
Orangemen he is glad to go back to the poor old
Pope ; for the Orange bosses are a sour and joyless
lot who, unlike the priests, never are able (or
Willing) to oblige you with a pack of cards and
a whisky-flask when you meet them on a long
train journey.
• * *
Governor Hopetoun paid a visit to a Vic-
torian country town recently, and the usual address
was read. It was an old, second-hand address
that was originally prepared for Sir 1 lenry Loch —
only he didn’t come —and it had been lying for-
gotten in some dusty corner ever since, till the city
fathers found it and blew the grit off it, and
brought it out once more. But they forgot to
make some necessary alterations, and the man who
read it plodded through the dismal tome mechani-
cally, and when became to an earnest hope that
His Excellency and Lady Loch might be happy to 1 -
gather in Victoria he droned right along and stuck
to the letter of his text. The bigamous statement
struck Hopetoun like a thunderbolt, and he never
smiled again that day. The mayor and corporation
didn’t smile either.
* * *
Governor Hopetoun’s latest baby is to
have a name “which will embody a compliment
to the country in which he was born.”
Will they call him Teddy waddy, Tabberrabbftb, Gooranr-
bat,
Yarrawonga, Yackandamlah, Bungaree, or Co\V tied Flat,
Cambalonga, Buln Buln, Nar Nar Goon, or Wollohiai,
Jam Jerup, or Yarrani Yarram, Narreeworhan, Boot'oopki,
Kellalac, Warracknabeftl, or Burmin BUmUU, Karkarooc,
BuckabanyUle, Deboobetic, Bumgerum, or Wooronook,
Bellnbong, or Tarnaguila, Tallygoroopna, Jericho,
Baw Baw, Dookie, Warrambat, or Narracan, or Bambalo,
Tambo, Tangil. Goolunibooko, Wonnangatta, Dandenong,
Kara Kara, or Toongabbie, Yarra Yarra, or Geelong?

The “barn-dancers’* were permitted to

The Anglican Bishop of Ballarat says that
the proportion of real godliness among the
aboriginal blacks of the Victorian mission stations
is higher than that of the white folks making the
Same professions. We notice, however, that they
always give the fat billet of bishop to a white-
man and not to a glorified nig ; but we live in
hopes of seeing a black ecclesiastic arise from the
soil. All hail to his coming lordship, Bishop Billy
of Bugaboo!

A late Governor of Tasmania once visited
Georgetown down the Tamar, at a time when the
local band, just organised, could only play three
times together. H.E. had intended to bring
along his daughter, but that sweet item had been
left at Launceston, in consequence of illness. The
Georgetown band blastingly welcomed the Gov.
with “God Save the Queen ” and “Auld Lang
Syne,” and so only had one tune left to fall back
upon. What that was may be guessed from the
remark of the bandmaster, a German, who, think-
ing to pay his Excellency a neat compliment,
blurted out —“Now den, poys, all togeder, blay
vor his Highness, * Dot kirl wot he titn’d pring
mit him,’ Auph you co !”

The S.M. Herald, in a review upon
“The Cry of the Curlew; A Yarn from the
Bush,” by Guy Eden, says “We do not know
whether Mr. Eden is responsible for the song of
‘The Old Bullock-dray.’” Great Poley ! We do
not know what the S.M.H. does know! “The
Old Bullock-dray ” is as stale to Australian bush-
men as the old-times expression of “Come and
tell us how you got lagged.”
* * «
A Sydney man lately went away with his
wife and family for holidays. Shortly afterwards
the neighbours were annoyed at a terrible smell
emanating from the absent one’s cottage, and
suspecting another hearthstone tragedy communi-
cated with the. police, who broke into the cottage,
with the result that they found the remains of a
big retriever dog—the animal had been locked in
*— under one of the beds.
* * *
The Melbourne bookmakers Who, thtee
weeks back, were laying level money that Williams
Wouldn’t be hanged within throb months,
bVidently “knew something;”
By the way, Marshal Lyle is scrupulously par-
ticular about calling his client “Baron Swanston,”
although Williams-Lawson talks freely of his
brothers, the Deemings.
• * »
One intending candidate in tbe Victorian
parliamentary elections was pressed at a meeting
as to whether he had not served a term of im-
prisonment in another province. He owned up,
and was not nominated. Which reminds us that,
years ago, when the late Francis Skeffington
Carroll stood for a S.A. constituency, he “put
up ” a friend to ask a similar question. “ Gentle-
men,” in effect, said Carroll to his meeting, “a
most dastardly attempt has been made to blacken
my character. On the paper first passed up to me
is this question—which I will answer to refute a
calumny—* Have you not served a sentence in
Pentridgo for forgery ?’ Gentlemen, I have never
been in Pentridge in my life.” Carroll Was re-
turned on the reaction of that dramatic episode.
But when the S.A. Register turned up the files
of the Melbourne Argus, and showed that Carroll
had served 18 months in Melbourne gaol— not
Pentridge— that unblushing diplomatist resigned.

A Melbourne business man is in a terrible
fix just now. He is a director of a bank, and also
manager of a brick co. f and, on tbe part of the
latter, has entered an action against himself as
director of the bank. Of course, on behalf of the
bank, he will deny everything he says Oil the part
of the company; and as manager of the company,
vVill probably have to take stern measilrds against
himself as director of the bank. If the company
get the verdict he will -rejoice exceedingly (as

then refuse assistance to his poverty-stricken
widow, who will die, calling down curses on his
head (as brick company’s manager) and promising
to meet him in heaven (as bank director.)

Governor Jersey, who seems to be a really
sympathetic man, was much affected on his visit
to Nyngan the other day when a woman suddenly
and informally interviewed him concerning her
son, sent to prison for cattle-stealing, for seven
years. She went down on her knees and loudly
called upon the Almighty to help her in her
sorrow. H.E. could, of course, only ask her to
petition.

Pastor Mayers, with a troop of little boys
who blow the bugle and sing psalms, is drumming
in Australia for Dr. Barnardo’s Orphanage, in
London. Let England consume her own smoke,

mends the good Pastor Mayers to visit on any

ludicrous if deplorable sights may be witnessed.
Clustered round the lagoon may be seen some 200
more or less naked men, inmates of the Sydney
refuges and cheap lodging-houses, who go there to
wash their clothes, no other place being available.

Miss Rose Scott, secretary of the N.S.W.
Womanhood Suffrage League, who has followed
Mrs. Ashton on to the lecturing platform as a
sort of counterpoise, struck one bedrock truth at
least in her lecture on “ Marriage and Social Life ”
when she contended that a woman who could
make a cold-blooded time-bargain with a man for
a year of married life could, with just as little
impurity, make one for a week. In her arguments
and inferences upon her theory that the principle
of purity is violated in every “ marriage which is
not for love,” Miss Scott seems to have nothing to
urge in favour of the facilitation of divorce in
hard cases. Thus :
It people make mistakes In life they must suffer for
those mistakes, nor expect either the world or the laws to
be continually making up to them for it. For “ whatso-
ever a man soWeth that shall he reap.”
In spite of the Biblical quotation, this philosophy
is more Buddhistic than Christian ; yet in it is
inherent a submission that excludes the relief
offered by legal divorce.

The velocity of a bereaved female looking
after her dead husband’s estate is often something
remarkable. At Babarat recently a good man
with considerable cash died about lO am., and the
same afternoon the formal notice that his widow
proposed to take out letters of administration ap-
peared in the Melbourne Herald. Either the
crushed and disconsolate one had written out the
notice and lodged it with her lawyer in Melbourne
while the old man Was still alive, and then wired
instructions to have it put in whenever he passed
aWay, or else she fled straight from his silent clay
to the telegraph office, and sent along the whole
advertisement, She was a remarkably prompt
female either way, and the old lamented, from his
new abode among the stars, must have looked down
with feelings of silent reverence.

The Canterbury (M.L.) Times publishes
some more sick, old flapdoodle rc Deeming :
Mr. Samuel Dunnan, of Soulbhrook, lias written to us
stating that, in ISST or 1853, a gipsy woman at Cranley,
in Surrey, who predicted several events in connection
with himself which subsequently came to pass, informed
him that during his lifetime a great murderer would
arise, but that then this criminal was a child, if born at
all, that ho would commit many murders, chiefly of
women in England, w ithout being caught, would commit
murders and other crimes in foreign countries, and would
ultimately be detected in Australia. Mr. Dunnan con-
tends that this statement shows that Deeming, the
Windsor murderer, is “Jack the Ripper.”
This reminds us very much of the fact that a black
woman was found dead in our grandfather’s back-
garden in 183!), thereby conclusively proving that
Sir Henry Parkes was Jorgen Jorgenson, and
that the Tower of London was built by Titus
Oates.

The old prize cattle-pen kind of vice regal
box begins to find its occupation gone at the
Melbourne theatres. Except on very State occa-

THE BARRED TOPIC.
Tom Smith was a hard by profession,
A sober young: slinger of ink,
Who used to make artless confession
Of all he might happen to think.
He let off his joy and his wonder
At things he beheld in this life,
He raved of the lightning and thunder,
But he never committed the blunder
Of penning an ode to his wife.
In strains that were hot unto burning
He sang of sweet Lilies and Kates,
And he wrote hitter verses concerning
The boors they were taking for mates,
tie told of his love for his mother ;
On leaves still uncut by a knife
There arc lines, by Tom Smith, “To
my brother,”
But he never, somehow or the other,
Wrote lines to his dear little wife.
On rivers and oceans and streamlets
He rushed into print by the yard,
And he often would dream pretty
drcamlets
Of the bright boyhood home of the
hard.
He was loyal, and wept while compos-
ing
A prayer Mr the Dflchßss Of Fife ;
lie was fond of “the day that is clos-
ing,”
And of subjects productive of dozing—
But he strictly avoided his Wife.
She died in due course, and the sorrow
Of Thhmas was sad to behold,
And his eyes Were inflamed bn the
morrow,
As of one who has taken a cold.
When he sang of “Gay, golden-haired
Dora ”
Who had fled from the world and its
strife
To the land of perennial aurora,
Where her mother had fluttered before
her
(’Twas the name of another man’s
wife).

“ The Honour of the Bar.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The barrister is the most accommodating of pro-
fessional friends. He will genially accept your
money without earning it, without even troubling
to try to earn it. He will accept it beforehand —
often, it is obvious, without even the intention to
earn it. Ho takes it beforehand because he knows
that he can’t sue for it afterwards. It is a point
of honour with him to rake in his fees in advance.
When he doesn’t he knows that the briefing soli-
citors make it a point of honour to hold it in
advance and have it ready for him on demand.
He is a fine gentleman—by Act of Parliament.
Follow me in some of his side-splitting humours.
* * *
Baiter, Q.C., is a tower of strength to any side of
a lawsuit. He is a magazine of legal subtleties, a
dynamo of eloquence, a chlorinating decomposer
of witnesses, a cataract of bluff, a garden-hose of
playfulness, a warming-pan of insinuating innuen-
does, a fountain of emotional variations, an earth-
quake of denunciation. Consequently, there is
never a big law-suit in the higher courts in which
Baiter is not retained on one side or the other.
Three courts are sitting simultaneously, with a
Baiter case proceeding at all three. Baiter is
leading counsel on one side of each. Each of his
three briefs is marked with a similar fee. How
does he arrange for his triple übiety ?
He doesn’t arrange at all. He follows the whim
of the moment, impulsive fellow that he is.
Perhaps he strolls at haphazard into and out of
all three courts, like a bee straying from flower to
flower, dusting his robes with pollen from each.
In that event, which is the most conscientious
duty he can possibly perform, he can only give
catch-fluke services to either of his trusting clients.
Just when his presence is urgently wanted at No.
I—to deal with a witness whom only he can con-
fuse and confound, or to argue a tweedledum
point which his junior is muddling into atweedle-
dee, or to cajole and liven up a jury being
drowsed into slumber by his wretched colleague,
Prosy Duffer, barrister-without spurs—he may be
away at No. 2 or No. 3.
Nevertheless, Baiter will pocket, without a
needle-prick of conscience, all three fees and all
the trinity of concomitant “ refreshers ” (of which
more anon).
For, “the law allows it, and the court awards
it.”
* * *
It may be that No. 1 wants Baiter so badly that
he suddenly gets his solicitor to double the great
advocate’s fee. Whereupon, Baiter will stay
piously where the harvest is greatest, and leave
Nos. 2 and 3 to the ungentle handling of Prosy
Duffers.
Or, without any extra fee, No. 1 case, from its
intricacy or notoriety, may interest Baiter more
than the others, may promise him a more bunchy
crown of kudos and forensic fame. Then also will
he stay where the harvest (of reputation) is
greatest, and let Nos. 2 and 3 take their shadowy
chances.
But. in either case, he urbanely pockets the
trinity of takings.
9 * *
Barristers often deliberately shirk their Work,
but it is a matter of high principle with them
never to shirk their fees—except when they abso-
lutely abandon one case by returning a brief to
the solicitor, on account of having accepted a
higher fee elsewhere. This painful operation is
always postponed until the last possible moment,
arid ft only applies to oases in which the retiring
barrister has no junior to assist him.
Thus : Bantam, not being a Q. 0., for whom
a junior is an indispensable accessory, is briefed
without a junior. He holds on till the last
moment, in the hope that a junior will bo
forthcoming. Then, finding himself alone
retained in the case, and finding that its hear-
ing prevents him from attending ar better-paid
suit where also he is single-handed, he returns
both brief and fee to the solicitor, whois then sud-
denly placed in the predicament of hunting up
and instructing a new barrister at the eleventh
hour. This is highly enjoyable to the poor
pocket-bleeding client, who ecstatically relishes
the raw efforts of his new counsel to swallow and
digest his brief at five minutes’ notice.
There is no law to punish Bantam, or even to
shock his feelings, for this practical joke, and he
rtill expects to go to Heaven when he dies.
But, if Bantam has a junior counsel, he can light-
heartedly attend the bigger-fetid case, and just
walk into and out of the first court at odd inter-
vals, or not even show his wig there at all, as he
chooses. But, as already mentioned, he collects
his fees all the same.

Rival legal humorists collude sometimes. Here
is a Sydney example :
Mugg v. Flatt. Leading counsel for the plain-
tiff, Baiter, Q.C.; do. do. defendant, Foiler, Q.C.
Baiter and Foiler meet in the street, on their
way to the courts, on the. morning of the trial.
They exchange salutations.
“Oh, by the way, Foiler, you’re for the defen-
dant in Mugg versus Flatt, are you not?”
“ Yes.”
“ I’m for Mugg. Are you going to attend ?”
“I suppose I must, if you do. It’s a nuisance,
because I’m retained for Rooke, in Rooke versus
Hawke, in the Obliquity Court, and I wanted
particularly to be there.”
“Strange! I’m retained for Hawke, and I
wanted to be there, too.”
Pause. Smiles, Then, both together :
“S’pose we leave Mugg versus Flatt to the
juniors ? I won’t go, if you don’t ? ”
“ Agreed.”
So they “ pair ” —at the expense of the clients —
and Mugg v. Flatt is left to the juniors.
Nevertheless, Baiter pockets Mugg’s money, and
that night delivers an earnest address on “ The
Necessity of National Honor ” before the National
Deformed Association. And Foiler pouches
Flatt’s savings and goes home and writes an essay
for The Earnest Thinker on “The Decay of
Christian Morality, Commercially and Socially
Considered.”

Hector Brassbrow, barrister, Sydney, was re-
tained as leading counsel for the plaintiff in the
case, Finesse versus Revoke. When the brief was
taken to his chambers, Brassbrow was down with
the influenza at home, and he remained in bed for
many days in fact, until a verdict had been given
in favour of Revoke. The hearing of the case had
occupied three days. Now, although Brassbrow had
never opened his brief, although he had never even
seen the outside of it, although he had never been
within half-a-mile of it, or approached within two
miles of the court during the whole of the hearing,
and although the client whose cause he might
have won had lost the lawsuit, he blandly pocketed
the following modest fees; Fee on brief, 50
guineas; second day, “refresher,” 30 guineas;
third day, “refresher;” 30 guineas. Total, 110
guineas. (Now, 110 guineas of “barrister’s
guineas ’’—for explanation, read further down the
article—amounts to £llB 55.). Brassbrow thus
was paid £llB ss. for staying in bed at home.

Some laymen-clients are so devoid of humour
that they actually get angry with a barrister who
stays away and does nothing for his money. An
enraged litigant has been known to argue with the
taxing-officer of the court, in fierce vehemence, to
the effect that Absentee, Q.C., for whose pre-
tended professional toil he is charged with royal
exactions, never appeared in the case at all, and
never rendered any service whatever. But the
discontented client might just as well talk to an
obelisk. The taxing-officer finds that moneys have
been paid over to Barrister Absentee by Solicitor
Wheedle, and orders the client to fork out.
But the acme of lay impudence is reached when
a furious client proposes to sue a barrister for
breach of contract. Such a case happened in
Benalla, Vic., lately.
Of course, the audacious person was a woman.
This inhumorous adventuress was actually under
the impression that, after she had paid for the
hire of a barrister, she was legally entitled to get
some work out of him. So she sued him for £2OO
damages!
THE SITUATION IN QUEENSLAND.
FRIENDLY BLACK: “Cheer up, mate, let me paint you allee same this fellow, then you get
plenty work, half-crown one week and tucker, you savee?”
The barefaced impudence of this presumptuous
female so staggered Judge Chomley that he could
not collect together enough of his legal wits to
decide what was to be done with this sacrilegious
rebel. The automatic section of his Honor an-
nounced, in muffled, phonographic tones, that it
was merely able to “ state a case for the Full
Court,” and then it subsided with a wearied gasp,
as though it had received a mortal shock. That
reckless woman will most probably have to pawn
her Wedding-ring to meet her law costs if she
pursues her perilous quest far enough.
# * *
In a former paper, I demonstrated that the
solicitor has a gold-mine in his office-boy.
Similarly, the barrister has payable alluvial in
his “clerk.”
Often the barrister’s clerk is a phantom of the
imagination, and does not corporeally exist.
Sometimes, when he does exist in the flesh, he is
the collective servant of two, three, four, or more,
barristers all living under the same roof. Very
rarely he is the hired imp of one barrister only.
In either of his two possible phases of real exist-
c,lice _ as a dividend or a sole possession—his
official salary is from Gs. to 10s. per week, “ and
ate himself.” . ,
Now, whenever a barrister rakes in a fee, he
always adds on another smaller item for his
“clerk.” The law prescribes it, and the taxing-
officer allows if.
No one, so far as I am able to make out, ever
saw the Australian barrister’s clerk who did get
any of these fees, but they are always charged
and always allowed. The Australian barrister
pockets tlie fees himself in addition to his own
authorised guineas.
Barristers’ guineas are defined by law to mean
the following amounts :—Up to 5 guineas, add
2s. Gd. for clerk’s fee ; from 5 to 10 guineas, add
ss. ; 10 to 20 guineas, add 10s.; 20 to 30 guineas,
add 155.; 30 to 50 guineas, add £1 ; from 50
guineas upwards, add per cent. The tariff,
therefore, reads :—1 guinea, £l,3s. Gd. ; 2 guineas,
£2 4s. Gd., and so on; 5 guineas, £5 10s.; G
guineas, £6 11s., &c. ; 10 guineas, £11; 20
guineas, £2l 15s. ; 30 guineas, £32 10s; 50
guineas, £53 IGs. 3d.; 100 guineas, £lO7 12s. Gd. ;
500 guineas, £538 2s. Cd.
Calculate from this, dariilg arithmetician, the
exact total of brief-fees and “ refreshers ” more or
less earned by, but in any case paid to, the several
counsel retained in the big Darling Downs land-
cases, which recently occupied 40 days in the
Brisbane (Q.) Supreme Court, and which then
took a fresh lease of continuance by reason of
leave being given to amend the pleadings, or
plaint.
* * »
History tells us that, in England, in the middle-
ages, there used to be a bona-fide, flesh-and-blood
barrister’s clerk, who used actually to handle the
fees paid in his name, from the modest half-crown
upwards. As regularly as he got it, the pro-
bability is that his master, the barrister, used to
borrow it from him, in order to expend it in
metheglin. The clerk has faded into a phantas-
mal memory, but the extra-fee custom of the
Devil’s Guild has remained unchanged, defying
the course of the centuries. And the Austra-
lian barrister has improved upon the prac-
tice of the bigwig of the middle-ages, for he bor-
rows the clerk’s fee in advance, in order to save
the spectral wraith of that vanished individual the
trouble of collecting it. And the barrister spends
it on cheroots and whisky.
Categorise barristers’ fees apart from “ brief ”
deposits:—Retainers; refreshers; “term” re-
freshers ; declarations and pleadings; conferences;
opinions ; probates (now abolished).
Retainers. —The fee for a general retainer,
which remains in force for 12 months, and must
be renewed yearly, is five guineas—a barrister’s
five guineas, or <£s 15s.
The payment of a retainer gives a client the
privilege of having first call on the retained
barrister’s services. When the man he is going
to law with has chanced to have also retained the
same barrister, the latter is entitled to act for the
man who first retained him.
Apart from that possibility, the rules regulating
retainers are peculiar and brimful of humour.
Suppose I pay £5 15s. yearly to retain Baiter,
Q.C., and I go to law with neighbour Bluster,
and, being rather short of spare cash, don’t care to
plunge enough to have Baiter specially briefed.
What then? Several things. Baiter may, if he
likes, act for Bluster and against me-me, whose
money he is accepting every year ! But if Bluster
does not offer him a brief, any more than I do,
and he does not appear in the case at all, still this
Baiter can claim from my solicitor the fee which
he would have got had I specially instructed that
he should have been briefed. By the double-
bottomed wig ! isn’t this monstrous ?
My solicitor will pay Baiter quickly enough,
and the taxing-officer will compel me to pay my
solicitor. This is Bushranging.
# * *
Refreshers.—The sum marked on a barrister’s
brief represents only his emoluments for one day’s
attendance (or non-attendance) at court on behalf
of the briefer. For every following day during
which the case may be dragged counsel receives a
“refresher,” which is generally two-thirds of thd
amount marked on the brief. Thus, if my solici-
tor briefs Baiter at 1)0 guineas (barristers’),
Baiter’s “refresher” for every day that my case
lasted after the first would be GO guineas (£O4
11s. od.).
“Term” Refreshers.—The legal year is
divided into four “ terms.” Now, suppose that a
barrister is briefed to appear in a case that is set
down for hearing in a particular term, and that
the said case is not heard in that particular term,
but is post; ned until a later term, that barrister
is held to be entitled to charge a “term refresher ”
for each futile term until the case is actually
heard. Again, if judgment is reserved, the bar-
rister claims the right to be specially re-briefed for
the purpose of attending to hear the judgment
delivered—whether he does attend or not. This
brief costs two guineas (£2 4s. 6d.).
# # #
Declarations and Pleadings.—lmagine a
Supreme Court action for common debt, the
defendant appearing to answer the writ. Counsel
for the plaintiff draws the “ declaration ” —that is,
a statement of the claim—wh cli generally is
made to run into the second sheet of foolscap—
two guineas (£2 4s. Gd.).
The solicitor could, of course, draw the declara-
tion, if he chose to do so, but the Taxing-Officer
would only allow him about half-a-guinea for that
feat of work, whereas he will allow the barrister
two guineas. The solicitor, therefore, always, as
a matter of practice, gives the barrister the job,
because the “ declaration ” is an item in the bill-
of-costs that is never “ taxed off.” It is a healthy
item to retain at its biggesfpossibility.
The “declaration” having been drawn by
plaintiff’s barrister, the counsel for defendant now
takes a hand, and draws a “plea.” In the sort of
case supposed this generally takes the short for-
mula —“The defendant says henever wasindebted
as alleged.” For this (!) the defending barrister is
allowed one guinea (£1 3s. Cd.).
Next, the plaintiff’s solicitor sends the “declara-
tion” and “plea” to plaintiff’s counsel, who
prepares a “ replication ” generally in these mas-
terful words “The plaintiff joins issue upon the
defendant’s plea.” The charge for this harrowing
brainwork is once more one guinea (£1 3s. Gd.).
Later on, the “declaration, plea, and replica-
tion,” which have been handed back to _ the
solicitor, are once more placed before the barrister
(each barrister on each side) for “advice on
evidence,” for which masterpiece of nothingness
the barrister generally gets three guineas (£3 ss.
Gd.), and never less than two guineas (£2 4s. Gd.).
A defendant’s barrister sometimes draws “de-
murrable pleas,” that is, rotten pleas which, on
the application of plaintiff’s counsel, are struck
out. But this makes no difference to the blunder-
ing barrister; he pockets his guinea for the bad
plea, and starts to draw another plea for another
guinea.
Barrister Nonnynoddle, of South Australia, a
distinguished University man, but legally as big a
duffer as ever wore a wig, used to live opulently
on the guineas he multiplied up by drawing long
sequences of “demurrable” pleas. He couldn’t
help it. That was his luck.
* * *
Conferences. —“ Conferences ” are legal harle-
quinades. When a brief is delivered to a barrister,
lie is generally told something about the case it
embodies —such as, “ This is a case of trespass of
Smith’s bull-dog into Johnson’s fowl-yard ; you’ll
see what it is; what’s going to win the Cup?
Good morning.” This, if you please, is a “con-
ference,” and is charged for at a rate of about 10
per cent, of the fee marked on the brief.
Opinions. “Counsel’s opinions ” symbolise one
of the rare occasions when the barrister really
gives his client some percentage of value for his
money. For an “ opinion,” a Q.C. will get from
5 to 10 guineas (from £5 10s. to £11), according to
the nature of the case. Junior barristers receive
from 2 to 5 guineas (£2 4s. Gd. to £5 10s.)
* # #
Probates. —“Ichabod” is written upon “pro-
bates ” in at least one Australian province—
N.S. Wales. Before the present N.S. Wales
Probate Act came into operation, probates
were a lucky-bag to the local junior bar.
A practice was in vogue, introduced by Sir
William Manning, of “moving” for “probate”
and “administration ” in court before the judge.
This was the goose-step of it. The affidavits in
support of the application were taken by a solicitor
to the “Ecclesiastical Club,” which examined
them, and, if in order, marked them “correct;”
if incorrect, they were rejected, and the solicitor
had to get fresh ones sworn. After having been
marked “correct,” a half-sheet of foolscap was
wrapped round the affidavits, which were then
handed to a junior barrister, whose only duty was
to rise up in court and say, as eloquently as he
could —“ Your Honor, I move for probate (or
“administration ”) in the estate of Defunct Stiff.”
“ Granted,” would reply his Honor.
For this superlative effort of genius, the junior
barrister would receive one or two guineas (£1 3s.
Gd. or £2 4s. Gd.), according to the value of the
estate.
This farrago of nonsense was abolished by the
Probate Act, although Sir William Manning,
M.L.C., strove strenuously to have it continued
when the measure, as a Bill, was before the
Nominee Chamber.
Probates are now taken out by solicitors, who
are only allowed ordinary attendance fees for the
alleged work.
* * *
Within the shadow of the justice-seat itself,
behold the beak of the vulture!
A client loses a case heard before a jury. His
barrister believes that an appeal will upset the
verdict. Well, if the client determines to take
the chance, he must submit to be fleeced further
as a preliminary.
Before an appeal can be taken to the Full
Court, a copy of the “Judge’s notes” must be
bought. There is no get-away. It is compulsory.
These “notes” can only be obtained from the
Judge’s Associate. (Who is sometimes the
Judge’s son, or near relative.)
The Associate will (generally, at all events)
hand over the “notes” to some miserable
boy, or worn-out old man, who will deem
himself rapidly rising to affluence if he is paid
Gd. per sheet of foolscap for copying them. But
the Associate will rigidly charge the client
ss. per sheet for every sheet so copied—£2s for
100 sheets, or a profit made out of the simplicity
of a sixpenny boy, or some wreck of a law-clerk,
and the sinful extortion permitted by law, of
£22 10s., for doing nothing whatever.
Yet, the Associate is a paid Civil Servant.

I am not going to discuss the question of the
desirability of amalgamating the various branches
of the legal profession. I-prefer to dream of the
ultimate abolition of the while guild.

BEDDING.
There is perhaps no part of House-Furnishing

and certainly the importance and the necessity for
pure, suitable, and properly manipulated materials
cannot be overrated.
A ricketty and badly finished article of Furni-
ture may annoy, and an ill-designed sideboard or
cabinfet offend good taste ; but, even then, no
serious harm occurs. But with improperly purified
or badly made BEDDING, how different the tale,

manufacture the bedding they sell, but, buying
from wholesale makers, have to offer their cus-
tomers Made-up Goods, of the contents of which
they actually know nothing.
Let us consider for a moment that one-third of
one’s life is spent in bed. Does it not concern you
to know that so great a part of life’s short span
ought to be carefully and properly provided for ?
Have you ever taken the trouble to examine
your mattress to find out what is in it ? Whether
HORSEHAIR or HOGHAIR,
WHITE JAVA KAPOK,
OR ONLY THAT
VERIEST OF RUBBISH,
THE OLD BLACKRAG FLOCK,
Or that short, seedy Indian Kapok called
Cotton Fly ?
Be vvise, be wise. Do not let another day pass
until you have thoroughly examined your bedding.
_ Those Drapers, Ironmongers, Co-operative
Societies, and others who simply take orders for
bedding from the
PRICE LIST OF CHEAP MAKERS
are still worse off, having no knowledge whatever
of its manufacture, and are governed simply by
CHEAP PRICE LISTS,
and in many instances just place the order with
whatever wholesale maker offers them the greatest
discount.
Nor is this the only disadvantage their customers
suffer, as too frequently the bedding is supplied
by small makers, who have neither adequate
machinery to prepare the materials nor suitable
premises in which to carry on the work. Indeed,
if the purchasers of bedding could only see the
condition and surroundings of some of the makers
of bedding they would not allow the bedding to
come within coo-ee of their backyards, let alone
their bedrooms.
LAWLERS, of GOB George-street, Brickfield-
liill. have for many years manufactured all Bedding
upon their OWN PREMISES, importing the
materials DIRECT, employing the most improved
machinery, and having the work turned out under
their own supervision. We therefore can
GUARANTEE UNPRECEDENTED
AC\LUE
and I nrivailed Purity in whatever Bedding or
Upholstery leaves our steam factories. The enor-
mous increase in our Bedding and Wire Mattress
Department is perhaps the best proof that
LAWLER’S
efforts to supply only pure and wholesome and
healthy bedding at moderate and popular prices
have been thoroughly appreciated.

Consumption Cure;
WILL
Absolutely and Permanently Cure Consumption
By its powerful action on the Tubercle Bacillus. It never
fails to arrest the disease, even in its most advanced stages
TESTIMONIALS:
“ Two years ago I suffered seriously from consumption.
I coughed incessantly, was prevented from sleeping
through night sweats, and my health seemed entirely
broken. After having tried treatment of different kinds,
both on and without recommendation of doctors, I was
adyised to try Herr von Ditten’s Consumption Cure. At
first it did not seem to have much effect, but after a couple
of months use according to directions, my health com-
menced to improve, and after a few months more a com-
plete cure was effected. 1 have never had a relapse, and
am still enjoying excellent health. I cannot do better
than to express my boundless gratitude, and to advise
other suffer.ers from consumption to try this marvellous
remedy without delay.—(Signed) Mrs. H. Kru.mliside,
8 Handwick View Terrace, Newland-street, Waverley.
Sydney, March 10, 1892.”
The undersigned, H. Hyett, certifies that “Two years
ago I was suffering from consumption in an advanced
stage, with coughing and spitting of blood and general
decline. My doctor declared me to be suffering from
consumption, and both I and my friends had almost
given up hope. I was then induced to try Herr von
Ditten’s Consumption Cure, and the effect soon became
apparent. After using the remedy for several months
according to directions, I am happy to say that I was
completely cured, and the cure has been a lasting one.
Words fail to express my gratitude for what I call the
saving of my life. I only hope that other sufferers will
give this great remedy a trial, and I feel confident that
they will not be disappointed if they persevere.—(Signed)
If. Hyett, HI Glebe-street, Glebe. Sydney, March 11

All Kinds of Most Thrilling and Comical Races !
Earth’s Greatest Bareback Riders.
As Measured by the Melbourne Press;
The Grand Roman Hippodrome provided some
very exciting races and fine displays of horseman-
ship. The chariot races were splendidly con-
tested, and furnished brilliant spectacles. The
utmost care had been taken to make the chariots
and the dresses of the drivers aroheeologically
correct.”— Daily Age.
“ Comprises no less than eight races, all run at
top speed, and with vast spirit. These include —
Ladies’flat race, pony race (monkey riders), man
against horse, elephant race, Roman standing,
gentlemen jockeys, clowns’ carnival race, four-
horse Roman chariot race. It certainly dwarfs
everything we have ever had in Australia.”—
Daily Herald.
“The Hippodrome Races were the concluding
items, and they proved to be unusually exciting.
It was very evident that emulation between the
competitors is stimulated by the bestowal of sub-
stantial prizes upon the winners. That it was “a
genuine affair’’was very soon discovered by the
audience. The great event of this character, how-
ever, was the race between two four-horse chariots,
the onlookers losing all self-control in witnessing
this remarkable trial of skill and speed.”— Daily
Telegraph.
“We have had a few big things in Melbourne,
and have rather flattered ourselves upon them,
and have grown knowing enough to ‘wink our
other eye ’ when discounting the tall tales of our
American cousins. We thought we knew what a
circus was, too, until the Sells Brothers strayed
our way. But they have shattered our old beliefs.
Twenty shows in one, and each show a circus in
itself, is too much of a revelation.”— Daily
Standard.
“ The entertainment, as a whole, fully bears out
the high reputation which it has won.” — Daily
Argus.

HOIST WITH HIS OWN PETARD.
At a meeting of the Society for the propagation
of faith-healing amongst the natives of New
Guinea held a few evenings since there was present
a tall, lank, sorrowful-looking man with extensive
feet and a pair of abnormally large hands encased
in a pair of rusty black gloves. He looked studi-
ously inside a shiny bell-topper for about three
minutes after entering the room, and then sat
down. The proceedings had got fairly under way
and the chairman invited “the experience of
friends,*’ The stranger thereupon arose and com-
menced : “I feel that it is good to be here to-
night.” “ Yes, yes,” from several brethren.
“And as I look round me I find it difficult to
analyse the emotions with which lam filled. You
are all unknown to me, yet I feel as though I had
been acquainted with you for years. I feel that I
may speak freely and frankly.” (“ Yes, yes. Go
on.’) “I am here to-night on a mission of love.
(Suppressed groans.) I have Been sent here to
represent in this neighborhood one of the finest
organisations under the sun. (Great excitement.)
I allude, dear friends, to the Life Insurance
Society of ”
There was a brief intermission at this juncture,
during which the stranger, persuaded by a few of
the moi’e vigorous brethren present, made an
undignified exit, carrying with him a solemn in-
junction from the chair that if his condition
betrayed need for repairs he could not do better
than call in at the nearest store and ask for a
bottle of St. Jacobs Oil. Abrasions of the skin
heal like magic under its soothing influence, and
the man who suffers the pangs of rheumatism or
neuralgia with a remedy at hand so cheap and
efficacious as St. Jacobs Oil, is not a fit subject
for sympathy.

ARE OPALS UNLUCKY?
Superstition as to the opal being unlucky is of
quite recent origin. It was not until Sir Walter
Scott wrote “ Anne of Geierstein ” that it came to
be so considered. It was said that the Baroness
Geierstein, Anne’s grandmother, was in league
with the Evil One, and that she would not cross
her forehead with holy water for fear of dropping
some of it upon a wondrously beautiful opal
ornament which she invariably wore One day
her husband, upon entering the church with her,
dipped the tips of his fingers in the font, and him-
self made the sign of the cross upon her forehead.
A drop fell upon the opal, which, first shooting
forth a dazzling flash of light, became colorless.
The Baroness thereupon dropped dead upon the
floor. All this is, of course, mere superstition ;
but it is no superstition to say that it is decidedly
unlucky to wear an unreliable watch, an act of
folly which is absolutely inexcusable when the
Waterbury Watches, the most accurate, low-cost
watches on the market, are to be obtained at
prices within tiro means of every industrious
person in tire community.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The Prince of Wales (whose mokes, which m
the best hands could never earn their oats, are now to he
sold) lias been a failure even on the turf. However, it’s a
good job for A.E. that lie has not had to scratch for a
living among the Sydney Driving Park punters. Had he
had to do so, they would have had a bill-of-salo over his
boots.
* • #
Our cricketers, scullers, pugs., etc., have tried
England, but not our peds. Now that times are so bad,
despite the Botany revival, Australian foot-runners might
do worse than visit Sheffield, where they should do well,
provided they ran up to their reputed Australian form.
But the latter is a doubtful item.
* * *
What has become of the eccentric young Eng-
lishman who used to start alone from Holdsworth’s Shed,
Sidney, for trips down the coast in a deep-keeled open
boat? This youth was once returning from Broken Bay,
and was not far from Sydney Heads when a S.W. gale
sprang up, and lie was blown off the coast. Next day his
boat was sighted by a steamer, and he was discovered fast
asleep in the bottom of the boat having made a line fast
to the mainsail, thrown it over to act as a sea-anchor, and
turned in for a snooze.
# # #
A distressing scene with a bitter moral lately
occurred in a certain Sydney street. Two carters—one,
venerable age, the other, hot, vigorous youth—squabbled,
threatened, fought. The hoary man was a real old
scienced bird, a prize-ring daddy, who cheerfully knocked
jumps off his unskilled opjvonent. Suddenly a blustering
voting rooster dashed between the combatants. Thrusting
the eld man aside, lie yelled “Don’t fight an old man !
Hit a young man. Hit me I Cur! Dog!” The sage
bird, unscathed, slipped softly aside and folded" his arms
to enjoy the fun. An ironical smile illumined his veteran
features, as his whilom opponent slugged the chivalrous
champion into jelly. It is curseful, simply curseful, to
have the motto “Mind your own business” sledge-
hammered into you when you act an heroic, unselfish
part ‘ * * *
The reign of the nig. up North has begun in
earnest. A Kanaka has won the Queensland bantam-
weight pugilistic chamjiionship. His opjionent, a white,
lasted 13 rounds.
* * *
Joe Goddard, the Barrier (N.S.W.) puncher,
has gone to ’Frisco to fight M'Auliffe, prior to claiming
the world’s championship. The list of prominent Austra-
lian boxers abroad is:—Slavin, Jackson, Fitzsimmons,
Jim Hall, Billy M‘Carthy, Bill Smith, Con Riordan,
George Dawson, Billy Maber, Paddy Gorman, Billy
Murphy, George M'Kenzie, Joe and Herb. Goddard.

G. Vautin, the well-known footballer and

It will probably be some time ere the plucky
stroke of the Melbourne University eight recovers from
the gruelling received, at the hands of the Sydney’Varsity
men, in his desperate and successful struggle over the
last half-mile in last Saturday’s race at Adelaide.
# * *
At the A. J.C. meeting, Chester’s get scored five
wins, Marvellous three, Welcome Jack two, Grandmaster
two, Robinson Crusoe two, and Grand Flaneur two.

" Melbourne Cricket Club averages for last season

The M.C.C. trundlers finished thus for the
season :—Phillips, 10.64 ; M’Leod, 15.41; Trumble, 15.72 ;
Bruce, 20.77 ; J. Wilson, 42.5.
# # #
Why should Marvel’s own sister bring 1400
guineas whilst the best of Chester’s, at the recent year-
ling sale, fetched hundreds less? The Chesters are all
racehorses ; whilst, so far, Marvel is the only Marvellous
clinker, and that only over a mile, though Marvellous’
progeny are as plentiful as black snakes. If the Marvel-
lous filly fetched 1400 guineas on the strength of her one
brother’s performances, what price Stromboli’s brother?
* # *
The adverse demonstration made at Rand wick
the other day against a certain notorious horse was
promptly put down by a brutal “push” of pugilists,
apparently organised, in advance, for the occasion. One
unfortunate boo-hoo-er had his ear almost cut off by a
blow. The assault was witnessed by hundreds of people,
and unless the A.J.C. ojrens its eyes and ears, somebody
will be strung up on a tree at an early date.
# * #
Old hands say the recent A. J.C; meeting was
the most barefaced on record as regards “stiffs.” The
public feels that it is high time the constitution of the
A.J.C. Committee were radically changed. To say more
—to name the two members who should quit, would be
sheer waste of space.
* * *
Seven jockeys came to grief in the A.J.C.
Steeplechase on Saturday—one suffering brain-concussion
and smashed ribs. The pious contingent of the club who
raise their eyebrows at the mention of Xmas Day and
Good Friday racing, don't seem to hystericise over the
numerous poor jockeys who when carried off the course
resemble nothing so much as a few stone of raspberry-
jam on a stretcher.
# # #
Stanbury, the champion sculler, is so youthful
iii appearance, that a Ryde (N.S.W.) magistrate ordered
him out of court, when an “improper” case came on.
By the way, when females and youths are commanded to
get out during the hearing of certain cases, why is the
boy-reporter allowed to remain ?
* # #
The Sydney bookmakers picnicked on Tuesday.
The principal viand was skinned lamb. Some big
prominent owners and joekeys should have been
honoured guests.
* * #
Oxide’s win in the Place Handicap on the last
day at Randwick showed that had he been ridden differ-
ently he might during his hitherto unlucky career have
secured more than place honours and coin.
« # #
Old timers should offer up a prayer now and
then for the repose of the spirit of good old professional
boat-racing, which died an unnatural death by reason of
‘eronk” work, a hint, by the way, which might well be
taken to heart by the Australian Jockey Club. Sydney
is on the eve of a world’s championship race, a fact
scarcely known outside the “ talent.” Sullivan is said to
he a phenomenon, but on performances and physique
Stanbury should finish ahead.
# # *
There is a big moral hanging to the miserable
failure of the late Hon. Jas. White’s horses in new hands.
* * #
Australian boxers are miles ahead of English
a « American. While the P.R. went down on both sides
of the Atlantic after the death of Sayers, Mace kept “ the
sacred lamp of pugdom burning”' in the Land of the
Kangaroo.
* m *
The practice of laying off part of the “sweep”
money is responsible for the larger fields lately seen in
big handicaps.
* * *
Why did the N.S.W. police authorities proceed
against the newspapers for publishing the advt. of,
perhaps, the only turf tipster who takes the trouble to
see ft gallop? Why were the eronk ’tins unnoticed? In
England and Victoria, where the law is more stringent,
tipsters’ ads. are allowed.
# # *
George Dawson has scored his first win in
America over an ex-amateur called Gallagher. The latter
is one of tlie rushing school, to which Dawson was not
sujqiosed to be partial, as witness his defeat by (the
apparently over-rated) Tommy Williams.
# # *
The outside public are not aware that Vain
Hope, third to Marvel and St. Blaize in the Doncaster
Handicap, is identical with Lamond, winner of the Metro-
politan Stakes of ’BB.
# * *
If horses could publish their thoughts, the lucu-
brations of a certain brilliant Randwick “stiff” would
probably be as sensational as Deeming’s “ Autobio-
graphy.”
# # #
It is more than a mere coincidence that in all
his winning races Mat Harris takes Marvel through on the
outside, while in the losing ones he chances to take the
inside.
# * *
Grafton’s success iu the A.J.O. Steeplechase
shows that a horse which can get over the obstacles,
whatever his pace, is always dangerous in a steeplechase.
* # *
Marvel should be re-christened Paradox.
# * #
Ducrow, winner of the Maiden Stakes at the
A.J.O. meeting, is full-brother to the much-travelled
Ringmaster.
Must the non-success of G’Naroo, Wild Rose,
Magic Circle, Gladstone, and other Victorians at the
A.J.O. meeting, he put down to the different direction in
which N.S.W. races are run? The right hand going did
not seem to affect La Tosoa or Strathmore.
# « #
Apropos The Bulletin’s advocacy of the legali-
sation of the totalisator in N.S.W., at a recent race-
meeting at Wellington (M.L.) £15,144 w-as betted through
the machine, of which £l6OO went to the Club, and about
£2OO to the Government.
# * *
Next to the swindling by the peds. themselves,
nothing did so much to bring about the downfall of Sydney
pedestrianism as the multiplicity of meetings. In the
footracing world there was no V.R.C. or A.J.O. to limit
and regulate days and dates.

Victorian football reaches its zenith this winter.
Oollingwood has produced a senior club to join in the
premiership fray, and is expected to carry off all the bar-

W. G. Grace, it is said, is very anxious to get
Jack Lyons to go to England and play for Gloucester-
shire, Grace’s county. Jack has not decided about it,
but he is not likely to stay in Adelaide unless he obtains
a good billet. At jnesent he is on the local Census staff.
Why, the Sydney girls all understood Lyons to be a
Broken Hillionaire.
Yance, the defeated Labour candidate for
the Musgrave (Q.) representation, is a captain in
the Salvation Army.
A cablegram gives Manchester Courier
as the authority for the positive announcement
that Prince George of Wales is betrothed to the
Princess May, the late Clarence's fiancee.
Motif for historical picture. The Hebrew
lectors of East Melbourne prostrate before the
figure of Ephraim Zox. “This be thy God, O
Israel ! ”
John Watson, M.L.A., for Fortitude
Valley (Q.), declares that one reason why the
“ meesionaries ” in the South Sea Islands don’t
want Kanakas to go away to Queensland is
because the islanders make the missionary copra
on Sundays.
When juries ai’e empowered to prescribe
sentences in addition to finding verdicts—in other
words, when the juries are privileged to say, not
only whether a prisoner is guilty, but exactly how
guilty he is—there will be no more room for
squabbles between the Judge who has sentenced
a man and the Minister of Justice who thinks the
offender got off too cheaply.
E. J. Ruble, ex-manager of the water-
logged St. Joseph’s Building Society of Sydney,
died the other day—of sheer grief. Had his death
occurred before the society’s suspension he would
have been followed to the grave by a cavalcade a
mile long. The old man’s almost last act was to
write a letter to the press ending:—“The
directors in a magnanimous spirit wish to make
me a scapegoat. I decidedly object to this, and
now leave the public to judge.” Then the old
man lay down and left the public.
Tlie acrobatic catch with which Graham, of
South Me'bourne, fielding as sub., dismissed Briggs in the
Britishers’ last match v. Victoria, recalled almost as
marvellous a grab by Ulyett, also on the M.C.C. ground,
some years ago. Graham ran backwards until his vertebra!
got tangled in (he spiked iron fence, and while doubled
backwards held the ball, which was then falling beyond
the boundary. Finally, he fell forward on his nose, hold-
ing the ball carefully off the grass. Then Briggs retired.

All throat and lung diseases, Ayer’s Cherry
1 ectoral is the best known remedy. When the,
bronchial tubes are sore and obstructed with
phlegm, this medicine is invaluable. It is an
anodyne expectorant, and, in cases of deep
seated consumption, it cures the coughing,
soothes and heals the lacerated tissues, and
Induces refreshing sleep. A few doses are usu-
ally sufficient to afford speedy relief in cases of
Odds and Coughs
It is also as speedily efficacious, and prompt
to allay the distressing symptoms of asthma,
bronchitis, sore throat, hoarseness, croup, and
whooping cough, and, in thousands of fami-
lies, is the only cure used. It is the best emer-
gency medicine and should always be at hand.
No household in which there are young chil-
dren, can afford to be without

HOW BABIES SUFFER
From Torturing Humors
When their tender Skins are literally On Fire with Itching and
Burning Eczemas and other Itching, Scaly, and Blotchy Skin and
Scalp Diseases, none but mothers realize.
To know that a single application of the Cuticura Reme-
dies will, in the great majority of cases, afford instant and complete
relief, permit rest and sleep, and point
to a permanent and economical (because
so speedy) cure, and not to use them
without a moment’s delay, is to be guilty
of positive inhumanity. [No greater leg-
acy can be bestowed upon a child than
a skin without blemish and a body nour-
ished with pure blood.
CUTICURA
Remedies are the greatest skin
cures, blood purifiers, and humor reme-
dies, are absolutely pure, and may be used from pimples to scrofula,
from infancy to age, with the most gratifying and unfailing success.

skin purifier and beautifier, externally, instantly allay the most intense itching, burn-
ing, and inflammation, soothe and heal raw and irritated surfaces, clear the skin and

impurities and poisonous elements, and thus removes the cause.

A Crime.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“Take another pull.”
( “ Can’t, old man, I’m nearly cut in two already.
Clod, I could chew sawdust ?”
‘ Lucky I found this pipe—it’s something to
suck anyhow.”
1 lie younger man took another pull at his belt
as they went along. Out of work for months,
out of food from time to time for weeks, they had
been thrown together and shared what little luck
had come to them. Tom was the elder, Bob the
younger.
They came to a vacant piece of land where a
man was talking about votes and rights and all
that. They listened awhile, but standing still
was cold work, and they soon walked away.
“I don’t care, Tom. I can’t stand this any
more. I’ll break open the first baker’s window we
.meet.”
“ Wait a while, Bob, luck may change.”
They argued a while here—Bob desperate and
lorn enduring and restraining him.
J hey arrived at the Gardens, when Bob said
he d knock down the first man he met if he looked
rich.
’Tvvon’t be as bad as stealing from a poor man,
and if you don’t like it, Tom, you can go away
and let me get run in alone.”
No, Bob, old pal, we’ll share our luck, remem-
ber, and I’ll stay with you.”
“ But, Tom, I’ve got no wife or family to mind,
and you ”
• r r u Ve none e '*ber, Bob,” said Tom, “and
if 1 had I wouldn’t care. Women are a nuisance,
and if it warn’t for one, I’d here he stopped
short.
I hey were walking down the asphalt-path of
the Gardens, where the dried leaves were for ever
rustling about the gutters, and the tall trees
bending over them as the wind moaned through
their branches.
I hey heard a gate shut behind them, and a
footstep.
“Here’s our show, Tom, let’s stick this fellow
up.”
lom agreed, and they walked on slowly, trying
to catch the footsteps behind them, as they were
drowned by the wind.
Another gate banged, and they heard a voice
singing,
“ Some swell coming from the play,” said Bob.
( “ Let him come atween us, and when I say
‘Now ! let’s turn and grab,” whispered Tom.
They each took a side of the path, and the foot-
steps came nearc r.
“ Walks as if he was drunk,” thought Tom.
“So much the better.” Then he cried “Now !”
and tlie two men turned and grasped—a woman,
with a baby in her arms.
“ You ! Tom ! ” exclaimed she, recognizing him,
“ \\ by, it’s Polly!” said Tom, “ and we was a-
gom’ to throttle you.”
“Tom ! baby’s starvin’ and dyin’.”
“Baby ? Whose?” ho asked.
“Don’t, Tom, you hurt! It’s his, if you want
to know. ”
“ His ! I a’most wish I had throttled ”
“ But she’s dying, Tom. I can’t save her.”
\ es, you’ll hill her, like you’ve killed me.”
“ You 1”
A es, if I didn’t go to the dogs when vou run
away—curse him !—l wouldn’t’ve got the sack.”
Then the baby began to cry, and they walked
on, the woman trying to sing it to sleep as she
had been doing before. Bob came up behind the
two.
“She’ll die soon,” said the woman, “and then
I’ll kill myself.”
She sat down under a tree, “ I aint goin’ no
further. Tom, forgive me for bein’ bad to you.
I'll be dead in the mornin’. I’ll die here.”
Tom said nothing, but Bob touched his arm.
“Old man,” said he, “that’s your wife, aint
she ? ’
“She was, Bob.”
“No matter. I aint going to let her and the
baby die, nor aint you;” and turning to the
woman he said: “You stay here mum, don’t go
away, and we’ll bring you something. Come
along, Tom.” And the men left her.
They returned in about an hour with a plentiful
supply of bread and milk and trotters. They
shared the bread and trotters, the milk was for
the baby.
* * *
Next morning considerable sympathy was
expressed in town for Sir Portleo Bingey,
K.C.M.G., who was reported to have been
violently assaulted by two ruffians as he was re-
turning to his residence. He had been relieved of
his watch and cash, and, worse than all, of a
manuscript lecture he was to deliver on “The
Present Depression,” Buc the two ruffians were
never discovered.
J.H.G.
The amount of dividend-tax paid to the
Queensland revenue by Mount Morgan mine since
1890 is over =£30,000.
The two most sickeningly snobbish napers
in the whole world are London Like and the
Hawk. Disgustus Moore, the egotist who runs
the latter, eternally fills his print with blustrous
drivel about his personal physical prowess, cata-
logues of the (small) men whom he has thumped,
and paragraphs obviously designed to show the
world how many “ illustrious” bladders allow him
to act as their toady; the German Hebrew
(Felbermann married, by the way, to a South
Australian lady), who is responsible for Life,
constantly publishes this sort of thing about his
own miserable self: —
Dr. Heinrich Felbermann, who, together with his old
friend, Prince Pierre of Coburg and Braganza, has had
the honour of an introduction to King Humbert at Rome,
is to continue his journey in the Prince’s company through
Sicily, and possibly to Athens and Constantinople.
Which is just about as odious, not to say revolting,
as the line pursued by the Australian person who
is constantly advertising that the Salivary
Sossitchwrap is “edited ” by him, and is always
thrusting his bald-headed photograph on public
attention.

Malted milk is made from the
richest and purest of milk, combined
with the nutritious and digestible
parts of wheat and malted barley.
Malted milk is not to be cooked,
no milk is to be added ; it is quickly
and readily prepared for instant use
by dissolving in water.
MALTED MILK is the best food for In-
fants. “ The composition of Malted
Milk resembles that of human milk.”
— Lancet, April 4, 1891.
Malted milk, as a food for In-
. valids, surpasses all other light diets.
Being most nutritious and easily
assimilated, it is constantly pres-
cribed by the Medical Profession
in England and America. “ Very
palatable, and free from adulterants.”
—British Medical Journal, April 18, 1891.
Halted Milk will keep indefinitely in any climate.
Of all Chemists and Druggists.

A small party of itinerant philanthropists
and sin-shifters who took an interest in the “ pore ”
Kanaka recently visited a northern sugar-planta-
tion and reported on what they saw there through
the medium of the local press. There were a
large number of islanders, male and female,
busily at work. They were all neatly dressed, and
a happy expression pervaded every black and
shining countenance. While they worked they
sang native songs, and their joyous chorus re-
echoed over the cane-fields. It was a pleasant,
patriarchal scene; the planter and the overseer
greeted every Kanaka by name as they passed,
and joked with them, and in response the joyous
Polynesian rent himself asunder from ear to ear
in a grin of childlike happiness. By-and-bye the
dinner-bell rang, and the happy family
rushed to the huge dining-hall, where a saved
nigger said grace, and they all ate a stupend-
ous meal of fresh beef, sucking-pig, and sweet
potatoes. Then the party of philanthropists went
away ranch impressed, and announced that the
plantation Kanaka was the only man on earth
whose life was one continuous dream of unalloyed
bliss. There was a row on that plantation the
week after, and thirty-four Kanakas marched
into town to make a complaint. Each
one carried in his murky talon a small
fragment of blackened carrion which had
been served out to him for dinner, and wanted the
local authorities to smell the obnoxious substance.
There were no sweet potatoes, no sucking-pig, no
knives and forks, no unctuous nigger saying grace
—each man was simply invited to grasp his
infected provender with his fingers, and, having
grasped it, he found it uneatable. The deputation
was cantankerous-looking and nearly naked, and
there was no pleasant song going on, and all the
poetry had vanished. The islanders had got
down to hard reality again. The clothes that had
been lent them to make an impression on the
foolish “ preachy man ” had been confiscated and
taken back to the storehouse. They had knocked
off singing because the pig and the sweet potatoes
had been promised them in payment for the
chorus, and when there was no pig the music
stopped. They all wanted to see “Mr. Govern-
ment,” and to demand that they should get at
least a bit of moderately healthy goat for dinner.
The patriarchal planter who took such a fatherly-
interest in them when the deputation was about,
stated that the carrion was all right, and sug-
gested that the whole (gory) lot ought to be put in
gaol. The Government-Inspector was worried and
suffering from prickly heat and ant-bites, so he
hurriedly dismissed them with a promise that he
would see into the matter. Then he-forgot to see
into it, and the islanders still get their lump of
dead-horse daily, and until the next preacher comes
along their chances of a decent dinner are as
limited as usual.
“ In buying of the shopkeepers,” writes a
Northern correspondent of The Bulletin, “the
Kanakas have a peculiar style of business. If the
price of the article is 55., the shopkeeper says,
‘This fellow one pound, come back fifteen shillings’:
thus the nig. knows that if he gives a pound he
will receive 15s. change. I have been years in
this district and never saw or heard of a Kanaka
begging. I have also seen them brought here by
the hundreds, have watched them stripped under-
going medical examination, and have never seen
more perfect men—they are straight as a dart,
muscular, clean-limbed and very active. The
majority either die in three years, or degenerate
into almost total wrecks. Their limbs get twisted
by rheumatism, or their bodies become covered
with repulsive sores—for the worst of contagious
diseases has a peculiar affinity for pure-blooded
men, and touches, it would seem, with compara-
tive gentleness civilised people of a mixed origin,
among whom the blood-taint, no matter how little
it may be visible, is widely diffused. And I have
been heart-sickened on going below aboard re-
turning slavers, and seeing the consumptive
blacks stretched out on the bare floor or
bunks, with nothing but the hard board
edge of the bunk to serve as a pillow. The
great source of anxiety to the shipowner and
captain has invariably been lest sick kanakas should
die in port and thus deprive the vessel of the.£s per
head return money. Often have I heard the remark,
“I hope to Christ these won’t peg out until we
are outside !” As to the Government agents, five
o.ut of six that I have known have been the most
depraved of drunkards. An interesting return of
these gentry could be had from the Emigration
and Polynesian Office. No notice need be taken
of the comments of the Kanaka missionaries. One
very prominent advocate of them up here declares
that the Kanaka women are more chaste than the
whites, which doesn’t say much for our 19 cen-
turies of civilisation. There are hundreds of
“ boys ” who have served their three years’ terra
knocking around town awaiting employment,
most of them “Christians,” but as they want
10s. a week and the planter can get recruits from
the Islands for 2s. Gd. per week, there is not much
hope for them.— Disciple.
PUBLIC OPINION.
Mr. Thomas Boulton Perry, J.P., of the well-
known firm of Dent and Perry, commission agents,
151 Sussex-street, Sydney, writes under date 23rd.
March, 1892 :—“I have been a sufferer for some
time from indigestion and a friend advised me to
try Boot's Indigestion Cure. I have taken three
bottles and am happy to say I am quite cured,
and I do really think that such an effectual cure
as mine has been should be circulated throughout
the length and breadtli of the land. You can
make use of this how you please. Yours &c.,

CORRESPONDENCE
No notice will be taken of communications which arrive
at this office insufficiently stamped.
“Newcastle’’: A good little story, but spoilt
by the poetic justice at the end. We don’t like poetic
justice; it is too personal....“ Barras ” : Pronouns
dreadfully mixed. No doubt you didn’t mean to say the
■ lady was lying on the desk and the letter sitting up in
n chair, but you say it all the same “Armand Dubois”:
We decline the cold boiled mutton story for 79 different
reasons. One of them is that the lady “swept from the
room.” Don’t sweep . “Bird Of Passage ” (Perth): A
wildly joyous item. Thanks,... “Tao-tara ” (Dunedin,
M.L.): We decline to go back on our joke, whether it is
true or not. It has just not (o be true, and that’s all
about it “J. Taylor ” : Will do our best to crumple up
your enemy “ Walter K. A.” (Sydney): Yes, there was
a horrible explosion, and you woke up. The story was
tied in a hard knot and you didn’t know how to explain
tilings, so you suddenly sat up in bed. We might have
published it if you had remained asleep ~ “ Jeff Buck ” ;
YES !!! We can’t say it louder than that,.. “0.11. W.”
(North Sydney): Thanks ... “Demo ” (Narrabri); The
spirit is willing but the screed is weak “ Back
Blocker”: Why not enact that every deceased person’s
wealth shall be divided equally among all his descendants?
Then the big estates and big fortunes dissolve as fast as
they accumulate... “The Orphan”: Tale rather heavy.
“ A.R.H.P.” : The story of how. you were brutally assaulted
by a dustman’s daughter is too unutterably rowdy
“ J. 0.” (Harden): Yes, and tlie U.S., where lynch-law
predominates, has now the biggest murder record on
earth. Lynch law leads to murder, and murder leads to
lynch law, and so on ad lib. The gallows is the father
and the mother of murder “Ballarat”; Thanks.
Already noticed... P.N.” (Bundaberg) : Seems to us
a nice, cool, lunatic asylum is a very good birthday pre-
sent for that town.... “ Iloamu ” ; Little hymnlels about
“Temper,” or “Meekness,” or “ Angels ever Bright and
Fair,” are not in our line. Jack the Ripper”: Too
ghastly. Sell your tale to a ghoul or a vampire
“A.M.” (Glebe): Thanks. Will probably publish ...
“Memo.” (Tasmania): You only tell half your story,
and take it for granted that vve know the other half, which
we don’t. ~ “Chas. Tipple ” (Dunedin, M.L.): Thanks. ..
“ H.S.M.” (Woollahra); It is utter foolishness to say that
because Australia wants land-nationalisation most of all
therefore Protection is a mistake. You might as well say
that because boots are good a man shouldn’t have a hat.
You can’t cure everything with one remedy. Land-
nationalisation is one of tlie grandest ideas on record, but
it won’t help to prevent cheap foreign pauper competition
reducing wages to 20s. a week.it won’t prevent nigger
labour, Chinamen, leprosy, monopolies in money— which
are as bad as land-monopolies, &c. The man who has
only one panacea is hopeless....“ J.P.” (Sydney): We
have no “usual terms*’ for poetry like that, excepting
terms that are too strong to be publishable “ A.D.”
(Kiama): You say “don’t acknowledge the tale it no
good,” so it hereby remains unacknowledged as directed.
Verax ” : There is too much lovely female in your
story. When you try to get a whole quart of lovely
female into a one-pint story it doesn’t fit “R.M'M,”
(Sydney): Declined. We don't admire that hangman so
much as you do “ M.R.A,” (Nyngan): Thanks. ..
“C. Green ’’ (Brewarrina): A Gothic mansion in Sydney
hidden in “ the profound gloom of forest shade” is just,
as idiotic as if you had introduced the heroine sitting quietly
on hot coals. The rest of the story matches the Gothic
mansion “ J. Osborne”: You say, “Only the foulest
are now, by a painless process, put out of the world.”
Now they are not always the “foulest,” for the law hangs
lots of men by mistake, and you can’t tell if the process
is painless unless you get hanged yourself “ Juvenis”:
When you crowd a whole love-story, w ith a blind mother
and a family of orphans, and the bailiff in possession, and
the ruin of the hero together with his trial and three
months gaol, and the heroine’s death from starvation,
into one side of notepaper, it looks too hurried
“U. Rudd”: Rreeza item very ancient. Will consider
the others. Canard ” : No measure to legitimise
children born out of wedlock lias yet been passed, nor is
there likely to be one for a long while . “M. M‘C. ”: In
April, ’9l, West Australia bad just under 50,000 inhabi-
tants. This has been increased by (say) 4000 since then.
.... “ Boiling Billy ” ; Address wanted.... “Nothing like
Fact ”: Your facts want washing.... “C. Jensen”; The i
medical view, which is rigid, is that a man who knows
the difference between right and wrong is not necessarily \
able to do what is rigid. The legal v iew, which is wrong,
is that a man who can distinguish between rigid, and j
wrong, is of necessity capable of controlling his impulses. ,
“Jeremiah” : It is ungentlemanly to argue with any- |
body about his religion..,. “ S.D.” (East Maitland) : Will
he glad to hear your idea at any time that suits you,.. J
“ 8.5.” : Your letter with the skull and crosshones and
the statement that, “you will have ber-hid ” has been
used as a pipe-light. We don’t take tlie same interest in
blood and crossbones that vve once did....” R. Crawford”:
Sort of a hair-oil item. First, a “most beautiful girl ”
comes along. Secondly, there arrives “a maiden too
lovely for earth.” Thirdly, there turns up a “ lady with
faultless features and eyes of inexpressible beauty
The advertiser’s motive is very thinly veiled
The strange woman who solicits from any'kind gentleman
by advertisement would solicit from the same unknown
individual on the street “A Bulletin Disciple” •
Hope to hear from you often “Henry T.”; “Ned
Hallman ” good in sentiment, but too utterly crude
'regarded as verse “Newport*’; Humourless, as you
have recorded it “ Invereli ” : Your “colonial wine ”
story is far older than any Australian wine which you can
now buy in bottles.. . “Copoh”: Hopelessly common-

Constable M'Carty’s Investigations.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Most unpleasantly adjacent to the haunts of lower
orders
Stood a “ terrace ’’ in the city when the current
year began,
And a notice indicated there were vacancies for
“ borders ”
In the middle house, and lodgings for a single
gentleman.
Now, a singular observer could have seen but few
attractions
Whether in the house, or “missus,” or tho
notice, or the street,
But at last there came a lodger whose “appear*
ances ” and actions
Puzzled Constable M'Carty, the policeman on
the beat.
lie (the single gent.) was wasted almost to ema-
ciation,
And his features were the palest that M’Oarty
ever saw,
And these indications, pointing to a past of dissi-
pation)
Greatly strengthened the suspicions of the agent
Of the law.
He (the lodger—hang the pronoun !) seemed to
like the stormy Weather,
When the elements in battle kept it up a little
late;
Yet he’d wander in the moonlight wheti the stars
were close together,
Taking ghostly consolation in a visioilaby state;
He would walk the streets fit midnight) when the
storm-king raised his banner)
Walk without his old umbrella) wave his arms
aboVe his head i
Or he’d fold them tight) and blotter; in a wild,
. disjointed nlanner,
While the town was wrapped ill slumber and he
_ should have been in bed;
Said the constable-on-duty : “Shure Oi wonthdt
phwat his trade is ?”
And the constable would watch him from tho
shadow of a wall,
But he never picked a pocket, and he ne’er accosted
ladies,
And the constable was puzzled what to make of
him at all.
Now, M'Oarty had arrested more than one
notorious dodger,
He had heard of men afflicted with the strangest
kirid of fads,
But he couldn’t fix the station or the business of
, the lodger)
Who at times would chum with cadgers, and
at other times with cads.
And the constable would often stahd ftnd wonder
how the gory
Sheol the stranger got his living, for he loafed
the time away
(And he often sought a hillock when the sun went
down in glory,
Just as if he was a mourner at the burial of the
day).
Mac. had noticed that the iodger did a mighty lot
of smoking,
And could “ stow away a long ’un,” never wink*
ing, so he could ;
And M‘Carty once, at midnight, came upon the
lodger poking
Round about suspicious alleys where the common
houses stood.
Yet the constable liad seen him in a class above
suspicion—
Seen him welcomed with effusion by a dozen
“ toney gents ”
Seen him driving in the buggy of a rising politician
Thro’ the gateway of the member’s toney private
residence.
And the constable, off duty, had observed the
lodger slipping
Down a lane to where the river opened on the
ocean wide,
Where he’d stand for hours gazing at the distant
anchor’d shipping,
But he never took his coat off, so it wasn’t
suicide.
For the constable had noticed that a man who’s
filled with loathing
For his selfish fellow-creatures and the evil
things that be,
Will, for some mysterious reason, shed a portion
of bis clothing,
Ere he takes his first and final plunge into
eternity.
And M'Carty, once at midnight—be it said to his
abasement—
Left his beat and climbed a railing of consider-
able height,
Just to watch the lodger’s shadow on the curtain
of his casement
While the little room was lighted In the list’ning
of the night.
Now, at first the shadow hinted that the substance
sat inditing;
Nowit indicated toothache, or the headache;
and again,
’Twould exaggerate the gestures of a dipsomaniac
fighting
Those original conceptions of a whisky-sodden
brain,
Then the constable, retreating, scratched his head
and muttered “Sorra
Wan of me can undershtand it. But Oi’ll keep
me Oi on him,
Divil take him an’ his tantrums j he’s a lunatic,
begorra !
Or, if he was up to mischief he’d be sure to douse
the glim.”
But M'Carty wasn’t easy, for he had a vague
suspicion
That a “skame” was bein’ plotted ; and he
thought the matter down
Till his mind was pretty certain that the business
was sedition,
And the man, in league with others, sought to
overthrow the Crown.
But, in spite of observation, Mao. received no
information
And was forced to stay inactive, being puzzled
for a charge.
That the lodger was a madman seemed the only
explanation,
Tho’ the house would scarcely harbour such a
lunatic at large.
Ills appearance failed to warrant apprehension as
a vagrant,
Tho’ ’twas getting very shabby, as the constable
could see ;
But M'Carty in the meantime hoped to catch him
in a flagrant
Bread) of peace, or the intention to commit a
felony.
(For digression there is leisure, and it is th
writer’s pleasure
Just to pause a while and ponder on a painful
legal fact,
Being forced to say in sorrow, and a line of doubt-
ful measure,
That there’s nothing so elastic as the cruel
Vagrant Act.
Now, M‘Carty knew his duty, and was brave as
any lion,
But he dreaded being “landed ”in an influential
bog—
As the chances were he would be if the man ho
had his eye on
Was a person of importance who was thravelling
incog. )
Want of sleep and over-worry seemed to tell upon
M'Carty i
He was thirsty more than ever, but his appetite
resigned ;
He was previously reckoned as a jolly chap and
hearty,
But the mystery was lying like a mountain on
his mind,
Tho’ he tried his best, he couldn't get a hold upon
the lodger,
For the latter’s antecedents weren’t known to
the police—
They considered that the “devil ” was a dark and
artful dodger
Who was scheming under cover for the downfall
of the peace.
’Twas a simple explanation, tho’ M'Carty didn't
know it,
While with half his penetration he might easily
have seen ;
That the object of his dangerous suspicions was a
poet,
Who was not so widely famous as he thought he
should have been.
And the constable grew thinner, till one morning,
“little dreamin’
Av the sword av revelation that was leapin’
from its sheath,”
He alighted on some verses in the columns of the
Frayman,
“ Wul the Christian name an' surname av the
lodger onderncath /”
Now, M‘Carty and the poet are as brother is to
brother,
Or, at least, as brothers should be ; and they
very often meet
O.i the lonely block at midnight, and they wink
at one another—
Disappearing down the by-way of a shanty in
the street.
And the poet's name? you’re asking—well, the
ground is very tender,
You must wait until the public put the gilt
upon the name,
Till a glorious, sorrow-drowning, and, perhaps, a
final “bender,”
Heralds his triumphant entrance to the thunder-
halls of Fame.

To the Taxpayers of New South Wales:
My Military Estimate.
Even a counter-jumper, a navvy, a wood-and-
water-joey, a public house loafer, or an M.L.O.
knows that the essence of efficacy with an army is
discipline or control. Our injured Irish friends,
our Scotch crofters, our Welsh tithe-payers, and
our Northumberland (N.S. W.) miners will tell you
how Martial Law is for high as regards severity.
The Clermont, Barcaldine and other shearers could
tell you a good deal about the Military Estimates :
I mean the estimate in which the Militiaman
(partly paid) and the Permanent soldier hold their
officers, and the estimation (of their own billets and
carcases) which is riveted to the commissions of
the gilded leaders of “ painted pomp.”
The soldiers were sent up to aid the police in
suppressing the mutiny which never existed,
though earnestly desired by the capitalists of
Queensland. Now the partly-paid corps were half
of them unionists, one body of men (that from
Charters Towers) being so palpably of the people
that they were promptly sent back. The Defence
Force or paid soldiers were half of them with the
non-rioting rioters. Half of them would not have
drawn trigger in a melee and the other half would
have fired high and not laid-’em-out.
How is it that the press did not publish a strike
that occurred among the troops ? At Clermont a
huge, deserted.boarding-house was chartered as a
mess-house, and Chinese cooks engaged. The
Mounted Infantry were first ordered to tackle
the “shduffin’,”; they refused and said “they’d
eat no Chinese and marched out.
The permanent or full-paid and enlisted men
knew better than to refuse; they simply stated
they were not hungry. The officers dared not
order the men to set to ; mutiny is very near the
surface when men don’t eat. The Sergeant-Major,
who was formerly by profession a lion-tamer in
Belgium, blustered, swore, and talked Court-
Martial. But the men got paid dinners in the
hotels; the Chinese were sent back to obscurity,
and the food was issued and cooked in a soldier-
like manner. Take note, the officers had no Royal
or Imperial or Foreign Auxiliary reserves to call
up handy. t .
Now let us see the state of barrack discipline.
The troops were quartered in the Town Hall sur-
rounded by a picket-fence. One paid soldier, a
bugler, called “Brummy ” for short, cared neither
for God nor gold-lace, and being an actor and use-
ful boon companion took a short cut at any hour
over the palings, till one night a certain lieu-
tenant, son of the boss fossil, challenged him.
The answer was “ Brummy ” at first, “Brummy,
you idiot” second time, and “ball-cartridge” to
end with, when he went for the officer. The latter
drew his sword and fled.
Now what was Brummy’s punishment for all
this? He was fined 55., and would never have
been lumbered but for the intervention of huge
Jerry Kane, an efficient and amiable constable.
In addition, he got seven days’ C. 8., which he
objected to keep, and succeeded in evading.
Shortly after the troops were ordered to Bareal-
dine, but Brummy had a benefit in the Town Hall
on the night of his proposed embarkation. He
positively refused to go, and challenged every
“ son of a sea-cook of an officer to fight him.”
This from his rostrum, the steps of his theatre.
He remained, and performed as per posters, being
arrested in the third act by the rear, a baggage-
guard, but the audience hooted them off the stage,
and he was allowed to finish his drama. For this
offence Captain F , of Rockhampton, gave him
fourteen days’ 0.8., when he again broke bar-
racks, and was arrested in a Chinese pub., playing
the cornet. For this, 48 hours’ cells. To end his
long defaulter-sheet a charge was trumped up
against him, and he was dismissed with ignominy
and handed over to the civil power. Being tried, he
was sentenced to nine months and released as a
first offender. At a Southern town, one M ,
a pupil of the instructor, defeated him at
singlestick, and was bullied and hounded out of
the service. Part of the business was so mixed up
with police and military arrest that the officers
were afraid to hold a committee of inquiry. This,
however, did take place, but the gunner knew
more than his commandant, who admonished him
for wearing plain clothes, to which he was en-
titled. They then had him for drunkenness, but
he proved himself to have been sober. Lace and
stripes told in the long-run, when Mac. got
shunted, and he is now in the Government
service.
At Sandgate, one B , a gunner, struck
Lieut. H , overpowered a corporal and file of
men, and was ordered to appear at the orderly-
room. There he turned up in plain clothes and
was sent to his house for his uniform. He again
bobbed up serenely to appear before a District
Court-Martial, which dismissed him with ignominy.
He tore off his own facings and scattered them to
the wind. His sentence of seven days’ imprison-
ment was remitted by Col. French, and he is now
in the Government Railway Service.
These games are ludicrous enough, but the next
is comic. At an encampment at Emu Park, near
Rockhampton, Sergt. H ,in charge of the
main guard, being at breakfast, was thrice called
by the sentry to turn-out. But he yelled out,
“Divil a turn-out I’ll turn-out till I’ve finished
my breakfast.” After a few minutes he appeared
with his plate, scraped off the bones, and said,
“Kim an guarrd.” The officer, accompanied
by the provost-sergeant, was nqn-plussed, but
being advised by the latter to give him a good
talking to, “the event is blotted from military
memory.’ My dear taxpayers, the Volunteers of
Queensland are the best troops there, the most
obedient, the most efficient, and the least encour-
aged, because they don’t carry paid billets for the
sons and relatives of legislators and toadies. In
this our peaceful country we want no soldiers.
We have no enemies, and can raise plenty of
volunteers, and a few paid pensioners to man the
guns in a case of necessity, and keep them clean
when out of use. At any rate, the <£50,000
retrenchment is a good move, and the amount
passed should be expended solely on the trained
scientists, such as have learnt how to teach, and
I do not grudge them high salaries.
SCOTTY THE WRINKLER.
Potted Man.
A Tale of the Cannibal Islands,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ What is the meaning of this ?” I asked, point-
ing to an empty meat-tin, carefully preserved
under a glass shade.
“That is the foundation of my fortune,”
returned Jenkins, who was showing me over a
new house he had just built in one of the railway
suburbs of Sydney.
He lifted the glass shade and took out the tin,
which was a large one calculated to hold about
31bs. On it was a gaudy label headed, “Potted
Man.” Underneath this inscription was a picture
in a circular line, depicting two or three savages
cutting up a white man ; this was labelled “ trade-
mark.” On either side, under the representations
of gold medals, were the inscriptions : First prize,
Congo ; gold medal, Dahomey ; honourable men-
tion, Patagonia ; gold medal, New Ireland, &0.,
&c.
“ For two years,” said Jenkins, “ Wilson and I
supplied the natives of the South Pacific with the
little delicacy contained in those tins, and we did
a roaring trade until the meddling missionaries
interfered.”
“ Potted man?” I said, interrogatively.
“Yes, potted man. There were three different-
coloured labels. White for Europeans, yellow for
Chinamen, and black for niggers.”
After lunch Jenkins condescended to satisfy my
curiosity.
“ You know, of course, that Wilson and I owned
the brig‘Pearl of the South.’ After the kanaka
export business was played out we found ourselves
out of work. We had done fairly well, but not
enough to do any good with. Then a brilliant idea
occurred to me. I communicated it to Wilson, we
clubbed our money together, and the result was—”
“ Potted man,” I again remarked.
“Exactly. We intended first to start the manu-
factory in N.S. Wales, somewhere down in the
Illawarra district, but the people were so slow and
greedy that we found it would never pay. As
soon as they understood we were willing to buy up
pigs right and left, they clapped on exorbitant
prices and lost a splendid trade. ”
“We must go to Chicago,” said Wilson, and we
went.
“But,” I said, “I don’t quite understand.
What were the pigs for ?”
“ Potted man, of course. Don’t you know that
at a certain age the skin and flesh of a pig exactly
resembles a man’s?”
“ That’s why a man is called ‘ long pig ?’ ”
“Certainly. It would take a very old and ex-
perienced cannibal to tell the difference once they
were both canned. Well, at Chicago we soon
fixed tilings up. Got the labels printed, a con-
tract for so many tins to be delivered in ’Frisco
every three months, and an agreement that a cer-
tain percentage of real human bones, toes, and
fingers, should be put in the meat.”
“Where did they get them?” I asked in
surprise.
“ I didn’t enquire; that was their look-out; dug
them up, I suppose. The spec, turned out all we
could wish ; the niggers thoroughly enjoyed the
dish, and fought over the tins at every place we
touched at. We had a fat Chinese cook on
board, and we used to chain him up between-
decks when we were at anchor, and put plates of
rice and biscuit and meat all round him. Then
we would take the niggers to the hatchway and
show him to them as a man we were fattening
up.”
“ How did they pay you ?”
“ First of all in copra and sandal-wood and all
sorts of trade ; but when we got our regular cus-
tomers we insisted on money, and that finally
burst us up.”
“How?”
“Why, when the islanders found we wanted
money they wouldn’t deal with the other traders
for anything else. Vessels came there choke full
of old muskets and other trash, and they simply
laughed at them ; all they wanted were Singapore
dollars. Finally, some of the whites got hold of
some empty tins and guessed the rest. Then a
snuffle-busting missionary came round, and told
the captain of a man of war we were dealing in
human flesh. Of course the man of war could not
do anything to us, but then the other traders
would be sure to adopt the idea and spoil our
market; so we took a final cargo away up to the
north-coast of New Guinea and to New Ireland
and gave the trade up, having done a roaring
good business for two years.”
“ Where is Wilson ? ”
“ Wilson ? Well, when we were off the coast of
Maoriland there was an old chief there who
owed us an account, and Wilson vowed he would
go and collect it as we were retiring. I tried to
persuade him not to, but he was a Scotchman and
very obstinate where money was concerned ; so he
went. Next morning I went ashore with an
armed party to look for him, but we only found
some clean-picked bones. Strange to say he was
the only real potted man of the lot.”
D.
The just-discovered leprous letter-carrier
of Rockhampton, Q., was a schoolmate of the
first-discovered local white leper, and is to join
the latter at the Moreton Bay white-leper retreat.
One of Frank Jardine’s beche-de-mer boats
lately found about ,£lOOO worth of old Spanish
silver dollars on the Barrier reef; likewise an old
cannon, which is now in Thursday Island museum.
The dollars date back about 70 to 80 years,
and are in clusters of from six to 10 stuck fast
together. Some of them are much eaten, others
do not bear any signs of decay. _ The ship is
supposed to have been an old Spanish merchant-
man going to China for tea.
David Gaunson thus figures it out. He
is insured for £2500. The Victorian rail way-law
is that relatives of any person killed in a railway-
accident cannot recover more than £2OOO as corn-
pensation; further, that should the life of the
person so killed have been insured, the amount of
the life-policy is to be deducted from the amount
of the damages to be paid. Therefore, were
Gaunson killed in a local railway-smash, the widow
Gaunson would have to pay the Railway Commis-
sioners £5OO for putting her in weeds.
A country journalist tells a Tamworth
(N.S.W.) paper how a press friend of his, being
out of work, accepted a position with a squatter
as tutor; lingual accomplishments, Latin, Greek,
French, German, and English. The salary was
£3O a year—not quite 12s. OVI. per week. Later,
he worked for a New England editor at £2 per
week to commence with ; this was reduced first to
£llos., and finally to “ anything per inch.” For
a one-column mining article he once received 45.,
and even that was paid in instalments.

(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Pulque Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“Tlx© Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
* g only paper 'which has a consistent and dis-
tinctive Australian National Policy.
liiE Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government*
One Person, one Vote.
Comolete Secularisation and Freedom of State
ikluc&tion.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System,
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.

A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility.”
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
end has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once bo seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin's inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as Was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly Universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in lilting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printin'*
ftnd the production of illustrations, and they have
how issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
foi'in printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress : it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend. .
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, .of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
.Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed bo broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

out that, according to the strict letter of the
N.S.W. Customs law, the N.S.W. Government
could charge 10 per cent, ad valorem on all the
fresh water imported into Broken Hill from S.A.,
since “fresh water ” is not enumerated among the
items subject to “ specific duties,” or contained in
the “ free list ” of the N.S.W. tariff. Every man,
therefore, in Broken Hill who doesn’t take his
grog “ neat ” is drinking smuggled liquor.

Wide Bay News misprint:—“ There is to

Speaking at the annual meeting of Foster’s
Brewing- Co., London, which last year bottled and
sold 22,000 doz. more beer than in 1800, Mr. Bal-
chin who lately visited Australia, remarked that
while in Queensland he was told there were two
sorts of Foster’s beer—one bottled in the province
with tin-foil tops, and the other bottled in Eng-
’^■e never heard of this before, but he
made enquiries, and found it was true. He offered
A250 reward for the detection of the authors of
the fraud. He found the engraver of the plate
who, to save himself, went before a magistrate
and made a confession. He also found the printer
and proved the delivery of 10,000labels to a certain
place, but he was never able to catch the man who
put the beer in the bottles. All his plans were
frustrated by an interested party, who published
in the newspapers a lot of particulars which put
people on their guard. Efforts to secure the per-
petrators of the forgery were only relinquished for
the time, and it was hoped that by-and-bv thev
would be caught.
THEY SANG ON THE SHIP’S DECK.
“Home, homo, sweet, sweet home;
Be it ever so humble there’s no place like hotne.’ ;
Blessed be the memory of John Howard Payne
for writing this song. Who doesn’t know it 9
Who hasn’t sung it? Full of hope, full of heart-
break, its melody has girdled the globe. In July,
1891, a large party of Cornish people sat on the
deck of the good ship City of Paris, bound from
New York to Liverpool. They were coming on a
Visit home after loilg absence. And as the, ship
ploughed the calm waters, they Siihg “Home,
Sweet Home.” But a gale cable dn, and for two
days most of them had other matters to occupy
their attention; they were too seasick to sing.
Then the Welsh coast was in sight, and they sang
once more, louder than ever. And so it goes on
everywhere—illness and trouble spoil the music.
“My wife never knew what it ivas to he well,”
Thus writes a husband, and here’s the rest of his
letter, “She always felt tired and languid,” he
says, “and never got enough rest. She had a
dreadful bad taste in the mouth, with a sinking
gnawing feeling at her chest, and her food seemed
to do her no good. She had also a dry hacking
cough which people said was a “ Churchyard
Cough.” She went as thin as a shadow and had
to alter her clothes and make them smaller. Now
better and now worse she went on suffering
like this for ten years, and took all kinds of
medicines, cod liver oil among the rest. She saw
several doctors who sounded her chest and asked
if any of her relatives had died of consumption,
leaving the impression on her mind that she was
consumptive herself. Now as her mother had
died of consumption she felt sure she was going
into a decline. Three years ago I was much con-
cerned about her. She had sick headache all the
time, pain in the sides and legs, and used often to
faint, and got so'weak I had to take her in my
arms and lift her in and out of bed. People asked
what was the matter with her, but she could
scarcely describe her condition, for it was an all-
gobe feeling, making her fit to drop down. Even
going upstairs tvould exhaust her and make her
febl faint.
In November, 1883, a book waS left at tile
house, in which my wife read of a case exactly like
hers, and she exclaimed : “That is just my com-
plaint, and as it has been cured by Mother Seigel’s
Syrup perhaps my ailment is not consumption
after all.”
“I got the Syrup and she found relief from the
first bottle, and soon grew quite strong. The
hacking cough left her and she now enjoys iier
food. I consider that a bottle of Seiget’s Syrup is
worth more than a week at the seaside. Before
taking this medicine my wife’s life was a misery
to her. You are at liberty to publish this state-
ment if you desire to do so.”
i (Signed) J. Jay Smith, Compositor, 25, Sudely
Street, Islington, London.
This is another instance of indigestion and
dyspepsia being mistaken for consumption. Fortu-
nately the little book referred to, revealed the
error in time to enable Mrs. Smith to treat her-
self for her real disease and bring about a quick
recovery. But cases with a less happy ending
constantly occur. We would again impress the
fact upon the public that consumption, rheu-
matism, gout, bronchitis, kidney complaint, and
nearly all affections of the throat, luhgs, and
nerves are virtually symptoms of indigestion and
dyspepsia, for the reason that they are caused by
a poison in the blood directly resulting from a
torpid state of the stomach, liver, and bowels.
Therefore, however strongly the indications seem
to point towards one of those so-called diseases,
your true course is to take Seigel’ Syrup, which
removes the radical difficulty which lies at the
bottom of nearly all physical suffering, viz.
indigestion and dyspepsia.
Who has not sometimes said, “ Oh, I have such
a headache—I can scarcely see?” What makes
the head ache? Well, the disordered nerves, of
course. And what throws the nerves out of
order ? Let us see.
“For fifteen years,” says Mr. W. D. Evans, of
Brynawel, Mount Pleasant, Swansea, “I had
been a great sufferer from indigestion and
flatulency. I had a bad taste in the mouth, with
pain and distress after eating, and my bowels
became much swollen. I felt languid and out of
spirits, and had great pain across the temples,
which at times was so severe I could scarcely see.
I saw several doctors who were unable to give me
more than temporary relief. In December, 1890,
I told a friend of mine, Mr. W. Lloyd. Rising Sun
Hotel, Morriston, how bad I was, and he advised
me to try Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup. After
taking two bottles all the pain and oppression left
me, and I never felt so well in my life as I have
done since. I eat my meals with relish, and feel
light and comfortable afterwards. This remedy
has worked a miracle on me. It is a blessing to
mankind.”
Headaches proceed from indigestion and dys-
pepsia. Use Seigel’s Syrup and your head will
jt on your shoulders like a flower on its stalk.
