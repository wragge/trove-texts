This Blacking is in liquid form and is applied to shoes
or other articles of leather by means of a sponge, attached
to the cork by a wire, so that the blacking can be used 1
anyone without soiling the lingers. No polishing bn
is required. It dries immediately after being applied, and
will not soil the most delicate clothing.

Ja
The extraordinary reputation of Rowland’s Macassar
Oil, Kalydor and Odonto, induces some shopkeepers to
offer spuriouß imitations under the lure of being cheap;
the principle on which each is prepared is confined
solely to the knowledge of A. Rowland & Sons, of 20.
Hatton Garden, London, and therefore it is highly
necessary to buy no Macassar Oil, Kalydor or Odonto
except those made by them, and. which hear their
name in red ink on the wrappers.

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may bo eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to hi)
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.
YOUNG MEN
who suffer from the results of early follies, trans-
gressions or excesses of more nature age, bladder
difficulties, a whitish or dark ropy sediment in
the water, accompanied by slight burning or
smarting sensation, Headaches, Drowsiness during
the day, circles round the eyes, Giddiness,
irregularity of the bowels, specks before the eyes,
bashfulness, discontentedness, weakness or pains
in the back, Liver or kidney complaints, dreams,
buzzing noises in the ears and head, pimples, a
fear that something dreadful is about to happen,
weak stomach, yellow or blood-shot eyes, impure
blood, hasty, unconti-ollable temper, hacking
cough, cannot marry, nervousness in society,
wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, general
weakness, and other symptoms which lead to in-
sanity and death, should consult him, for ho has
mastered these difficulties. On receipt of 6d. in
stamps he will send secure from observation in a
plain wrapper, postage
FREE, A LARGE CLOTU-BOUND
BOOK.
Showing plainly how all diseases of the private or
nervous system may be cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnecessary expence. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
lion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If jou do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous meJical
work, the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will be found a Pst of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by lire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between tin doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,090 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All
communications should be addressed

I am aware .that I am not strictL f,Viewing the paths
of professional etiquette by advertising myself as a
Sr ecinlist for the tieatm-nt of this class of (Use -re. but,
unfortunately for the suffering public in Australia, the
a path V shown by Qualified Men in the treatment of
Chronic ami Nervous Complaints has induced men of the
lowest grade of intellect (whose only qualifications are
unlimited assurance) to spring up, and by specious
advertisements and false promises nap the unwary.
It is very evident that suffe c.rs from these diseases
have been scandalously treated by those unqual lied
persons The evidence takei, at the Medical Iniquity
held in Fyrinev (published in the Unity Til graph. Nov.
Gth Ith and t-ih. ItOll) plainly shows the disgraceful
manner in ivh cli patients are dueod. Not only are
they robbed of their money hut what is of inft. itely
greater importance, their health is injure I i Iso. It is
Ihere'bre time that I.egally Qualified .lien entered the
field to fight these pests ot society with their own
weapons, viz., Advertising.
It is utterly intposs b’.c for those who are suffering
front the e diseases, who are seatin' o 1 over 11 parts of
Australasia, to ascertain which ({nidified IVarl it loner
makes these diseases hisspoeiality unless he advertises.
I consider therefore, that, by advertising I „-t o lj
strike a bine fit the Quackery which now exists, but I also n/lil
to the usefulness of my profession ami in no way lessen wy
_ personal dignity,
BTy Qualifications I Invite the fullest investigation Into. For some coi sldevable time I wa* House Surgrron to the
Great Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of ocßervin ; the many phnses of the Nervous a id
Soxua System, and to be ome acquainted with the most scientific methods of ettoctirig their cure.
Sexna System, and to bo ome acquainted \ -
Mvsolc attention is given to the treatmenfcof these diseases, and when a person consults mo he is informed at the
commencement whether I can effect his cure or not. The patient is not deluded with false and specious promises, and
if I undertake the case
I Absolutely Guarantee a Complete and Permanent Cure.
My great success in the treatment of these diseases enables me to give this guarantee without fear.

SATURDAY, MARCH 21, 1891.
The Sovereignty of the People.
The democratic ideal is the ennobling of the
individual—the education of each man,
woman and child to the highest capacities
and uses that Nature intended him or her to
manifest and to exert. A Government is
democratic in proportion as its deeds
approximate in character to the ideal, and as
it answers to the demand that it shall im-
prove the political and social environment of
each unit of the State to such a degree that
no pure or honourable desire expressed by
that unit shall go unsatisfied, and that no
faculty shall be permitted to dwarf and
Avither for want of the means of culture
and development. Democratic Govern-
ments have thus no reason to exist
except they subserve the people’s good. They
are but a means to an end —to be checked
and regulated if they diverge from the path
to the goal—to be stimulated if they lag—
to be purified if they become corrupt.
Government is never the end in a society
where the people are the ultimate arbiters
of national movements. It is an end only
Avhen a Caste-protected fe\v rule themselves,
or sway the nominal rulers. Then, Govern-
ment is the goal, because behind it the
Classes can store their arsenals and furnish
their treasuries.
# # #
Deriving its force in a democratic society
from the consent of the governed, and being
the trustee of power and authority delegated
to it by the people, Government, to adopt
Herbert Spencer’s phrase, consists in
“ administering the functions of a committee
of management.” The governing body,
whether it is a Parliament, or a Congress, a
Swiss Federal Council, an American Presi-
dent’s Cabinet, or an Australian Ministry—
call itself what it likes and magnify itself as it
pleases—is in the democratic theory a simple
committee. It is a committee of the People.
It acts consistently with its commission only
when it keeps in view the good of the
people, of which good the people themselves
must be the judges. It acts treacherously
when, before the popular welfare, it places
the interests of a section of its own people or
some other and exterior people ; and, again,
Avhen it refuses to obey the people’s mandate,
or Avhen it refuses to elicit the people’s will
in any crisis of the national affairs. A demo-
cratic government has no right to exist that
does not, directly and mediately, aim at the
elevation of that aggregation of individuals
which it is the custom to term “the people
of a State ” in the method most desired by
the individuals themselves.
* * *
These Australian provinces are democratic
societies, and, therefore, the people are
supreme, and the several Governments are
merely committees of management more or
Jess faithful to the terms, stated and implied,
of their commissions. From the list of
functions of these committees it is now pro-
posed, by the Federal Convention, to ab-
stract some of the included powers, and to
endow a new Government, which will, in
fact, be nothing more than a new committee,
with the total of the powers so excised from
the authorities of the several provincial
committees. And this, it is claimed, can
be effected, and ought to be effected
without particular and immediate reference
to the seven distinct Australasian peoples !
There is treason here, not alone to future
generations, but the present one. Every
member of Parliament and every Minister
of the Crown in Convention has sworn to
be faithful to the Constitution of the State
which chose him from the mob as one of its
committee-men. In consenting to any
federative resolutions which in their ultimate
scope will annul, transfer, or modify any of
the powers—-and powers are liberties —which
were entrusted to his hands as a committee-
man of a province, except on the one condition
that a draft of a Federal Constitution shall
be definitely submitted to the whole
people—not merely to the Parliament,
not merely to the present over-franchised
and under - franchised electors —of his
State, he will fail in h : s duty, will exceed
his commission, and because his action is
a violation of a public trust, will
act traitorously to lire public weal.
There is no getting away from the fact that
in no Australian province have the people
issued a mandate that they shall be associated
with others in a federation. And unless it
bo conceded that these provinces are not
democratic, or it be asserted that the people
do not, in the last resort, rule, then it must
be admitted that the constituents of each
State have a right—the inalienable right
which is the prerogative of their State-hood
—to declare whether there shall or shall not
be bartered away in exchange for hypothetical
privileges to be c nferred by a Federal Par-
liament, certain of the liberties which they
entrusted, as factors for the common good,
to their own local and nrovincial committee-
men No Australian elector should be asked
to declare fealty to a Federal Constitution
who has not first had the choice personally
submitted to him as to whether he will
acquiesce in a delegation by his individual
State of certain of his liberties.
# * *
For, wrapping up the fact as one may, the
transfer of State powers to a Federal Govern-
ment means an abandonment of certain sub-
sisting liberties. The circumstance that
other liberties are to be exchanged for those
so resigned or surrendered does not affect
the point that some liberties, some capacity
in the individual citizen to do this thing or
that thing within the bounds of his State,
will have to be given up on the consumma-
tion of Federation. Put, then, in this way,
how can it be contended seriously that a
Parliament or a Ministerial Executive, which
is entitled only to obedience in so far as it
respects subsisting liberties and protects the
common weal, can, of its own motion, nullify
the existing constitution of its State, and then,
extracting certain powers and functions from
it, present them to the Federal or Central
Government? A Federal Constitution can-
not come into force till it has been approved
by a piece of legislative machinery, the British
Parliament, which has no sound interest
in our concerns. What a farce to appeal for
ratification to an exterior agent, while it is
not considered necessary or expedient to
request the assent of the people whose
destinies are affected !
* * #
The peoples of the several Australian
States are essentially sovereign. They may
be denied the title and the form ; the essence
and the fact remains. No one doubts what
the upshot would be if any exterior power
sought to thrust its pretentions to sovereignty
down our throats on a question which materi-
ally concerned us. If the Privy Council,
for instance, decides that Ah Toy shall be
allowed into Victoria, what will happen 1
An Toy will be kept out all the same.
Carington, if he learnt nothing else in the
“colonies,” learnt this much. “They will
be loyal and respect the Imperial connec-
tion,” he said of the Australias, “so long as
they get their own way.” Just so ; Britain
can be sovereign so long as she does not
assert her sovereignty. Her claims, there-
fore; cannot abrogate the right of each Aus-
tralasian province to act as a free and
sovereign State. There is no attribute of
sovereignt}' that, if a province choose, it
cannot exercise. Eabh already imposes taxes
and tries criminals, and each can make war.
Sir James M‘Culloch, of Victoria, made
war on New South Wales when he sent
armed men into her territory to resent
the latter State’s imposition of certain
duties. What he did on a small scale
may be done on a large one at any
time by any Australian province with rela-
tion to any other Australasian province or
any extra-Australasian country—as New
South Wales made war upon the Arabs of
the Soudan. It may be legal to deny
their sovereignty to the people of an Austra-
lasian State ; but the law is one side and
the practice on the other, and somehow,
when it comes to a conflict between the
practice of a massed people and the legalistic
theory, it is the latter which goes under.
Now, the people of an Australasian province
being sovereign, it follows that their liberties
are inherent ; and that their voice must bo
paramount in the disposition of such
liberties. If they are Avilling to delegate
some —well, who shall say them nay ? But,
if they are not willing, their liberties can
only be withdrawn by treason or coercion.
Without the common consent, directly
elicited, of the several r copies of Australia,
there can be no stability of Federation.
Nor, even if a Federal Union be achieved,
can it have any lasting vitality unless it
definitively and absolutely respects the
sovereignty of the individual States. The
sovereignty may be held in abeyance while
the Federal Government preserves equity,
but it will nevertheless exist. The
sovereignty of a democratic people is as
inalienable as a man’s personal identity. We
are now talking about marriage. Let us
think well also about divorce.
On Pious Literature and Other Matters.
Men may come and men may go, but the great
art and science of grandmotherly drivel goes on
and on and on for evermore. Preachers rise
and flourish for a time, but they generally
seduce the good-looking soprano maiden in the
choir, and after that they light out for Cali-
fornia’s vine-clad hills, where they lecture to
men only, and take money at the door, and
pay it in reverently to a sanctified bank-
account. Sunday-school superintendents mul-
tiply and prosper till the books are audited at
the office, and then they skip to join the
illimitable procession of detected snufflebusters
who infest the peaceful land of Japan, or
the slumberous cities of quiet Mexico.
Respectable business-men prop up the Church
and boom the good work generally all through
their youth and manhood, till an evil day
arrives when the orphan comes of age and
wants the trust-money, and then they stick up
notices on their respective doors that they will
be back in ten minutes, and are never seen or
heard of again. Things in general are fleeting
and unstable, and the pious section of the
human race is ephemeral in its character, but
the great art of greasy piety has no end. It
always uses the same language and the same old
figures of speech, and groans over the same
dreary texts—it is always engaged in some
“Movement” which never moves, or some
“ Cause ” which never causes anything —and it
always starts by appointing the same mouldy,
addle-headed, fat man as president, and he
always makes the same old oration in which he
invites his audience to ponder over the blessed
promise contained in Zach., 4th chapter,
verses 11 and 12, or thereabouts. Then he
sheds an oily tear, as he explains that the
object of the “Movement” is to spread reli-
gion and morals among the poor, it being an
unfailing axiom that the poor haven’t any
morals whatever until a-supply is laid on for
them by a society, and regulated by the bald-
headed parent in the chair.
* # #
About the most conspicuous feature of modern
Christianity is the unhealthy tendency on the
part of the man who earns a “ salary ” to form
himself into a society for the purpose of bestow-
ing his lofty paternal blessing on the man who
only earns “wages.” It is invariably under-
stood that the man who earns wages has no
fixed morality and needs to be supplied with it
through the beneyolence of the other party —
that he lacks elevation, and that the other indi-
vidual has a stock of elevation on hand which
he is ready to bestow upon him should he show
himself sufficiently deserving—and that in a
general way the “working classes” require to
be called on, and exhorted, and enlightened by
the agency of tracts and similar literature.
And in addition to this it is always considered
that the ‘ ‘ working classes ” need counsel and
fatherly guidance in worldly matters, and
especially they want some pimpled individual
to warn them that strikes and labour agitations
are evidences of an undue desire to look after
the things of earth, whereas they should devote
themselves rather to heavenly considerations.
Even the sad, unhealthy boy who has been
brought up under “ pious influences,” and who
has just finished being caned at school and
begun to enlarge into an unhealthy, red-headed
youth, cheerfully joins in this good work;
for his “ salary ” of £75 per annum
fully qualifies him to aid in spreading
Christian principles among the “ lower orders.”
In England, where the system is better deve-
loped, this strumous infant travels round offer-
ing parental counsel and admonition to elderly
carpenters and bricklayers, and owing to the
traditions born of centuries of abject reverence
he escapes unkicked, unbattered, and unhung.
And now in Australia he is manifesting a ten-
dency to try the same experiment, and in com-
pany with the parson and the orthodox old
woman he proposes to bestow his kindly pat-
ronage on the ignorant people who work, and
to show them the road to culture and refine-
ment and morality generally. The basis of the
movement is the assumption that the man who
“occupies a position” has always enough
Christian virtues for his own consumption and
a lot over to give away, and that the man who
has a “job” instead of a “position” hasn’t
any virtues at all, except when the other
individual is looking after him and giving him
tracts.
» * «
The sort of Christianity which devotes itself
to the salvation of the bricklaying pagan or the
agricultural heathen invariably runs a species
of litei’ature which is like no other literature
under the sun. It consists of a series of bald
and naked pamphlets filled with surprising
narratives of the disasters which fell on some
bad clodhopper who drank beer, and the sur-
prising good fortune of a good clodhopper who
didn’t drink beer, but went to church regularly,
and was content with his wages—which were
amazingly small—and lived in a thatched cot-
tage, and was a good, humble, reverent clod-
hopper all his life. He always survived to a
great age, and in his latter days he sat in a hard
chair regularly, and read a big print Bible, and
lived on no visible substance per week, and
when the parson called on him and didn’t give
him anything he always grovelled to that
clerical authority, and said that he had much
to be thankful for. These productions are
always written, as far as possible, in words of
one syllable, for it is generally understood that
the “working classes” read with great difli-
culty ; and they are printed in immense
for it is recognised that the common toiler fs
short of intelligence, and can only be made to
comprehend when he is spoken to very slowly,
and hollered at in an exceedingly loud tone of
voice. Therefore, even the print is made to
scream at him in its loudest utterance, and the
lines are far apart, so that when he has finished
one he may have time to get his second wind
before he starts the next. These publications
are loose in their grammar and geography, but
it is taken for granted that the “working
classes ” are not fitted to appreciate either of
these branches of knowledge ; and they always
tell how the good squire gave tuppence to the
poor, and was held in reverence ever afterwards
as the natural consequence, and ultimately
went to Heaven, and how the elderly
bad man who received and misused these two
coppers, died miserably and went to hell. And
as a rule they are decorated with soul-blasting
woodcuts, showing the awful manner in which
John Smith, a sinful workman with big feet
who was dissatisfied with his wages, was struck
by lightning; while John Jones, who also had
big feet but was contented with wages,
escaped, and lived happily ever afterwards.
And when half a ton of this literature has been
printed at reduced rates in a “scab” printing
office, and disseminated among the “ working
classes,” and used as pipe-lights, and still the
millennium doesn’t start, the society generally
resolves that the “ poor ” are too low and sinful
and beastly to be capable of elevation. Then it
gives up the contract and dissolves miserably ;
and there is a pause till two more bulgy clergy-
men, and another pimpled youth, and six more
old women take up the great undertaking, and
start to elevate the masses once more.
# # *
The underlying principle of all modern Chris-
tianity, in fact, is the assumption that any
bloated individual who has money enough to
hire a hall and a secretary, and to print a pros-
pectus, is qualified to spread Christian know-
ledge and morality among the poorer multi-
tudes, and that everybody who has not money
enough for these purposes wants to be taught
Christianity and dry-nursed by any bottle-nosed
capitalist who chooses to take a hand in the
movement. And this naturally implies another
assumption that wealth is always acquired
honourably, and that poverty is always acquired
dishonourably, else there is neither sense nor
reason in a plan by which the rich snuffler
always starts to teach the poorer individual
who does not snuffle. The funds, it is true, ate
largely supplied by the pious defaulter who
subscribes out of the stolen cash, and by the
holy accountant who puts Up part of the
orphan’s trust-money and afterwards scoots
with the rest; and the director of the insolvent
building society also takes a hand ; and when
a cheque is received from the wealthy person
who was tried for criminal assault and got off
by squaring the prosecutor, he is hailed as a
sincere believer, and starts to disseminate
Christian principles among the working classes
forthwith. Nobody ever made a great fortune
by Christian principles for these principles are
constructed on so strict a plan that they make
the accumulation of wealth impossible. Hardly
anybody ever succeeded in living up to the
doctrines of the New Testament and having
enough oyer to send even a small donation to
any society for the spread of morality among
the poor. The gospel that was promulgated in
Palestine is so exceedingly uncompromising as
to make it almost certain that the man who
pays for the hall is a coarse, uiiregenerate
sinner, and that the individual who supplies
the printing is a bad character of some descrip-
tion, and that the parties who put up the
incidental expenses are lost for evermore unless
they stop spreading Christian principles and
instead get some Christian principles to spread.
The average philanthropic movement is not an
evidence of philanthropy ; it is merely a proof
that the philanthropist had money enough to
get his name put in the papers; and the indi-
vidual whom he proposes to teach and.
“elevate” is often the person whom he
swindled—directly or indirectly—out of the
coin which pays for the alleged “elevation.”
* # *
There is probably only one kind of pious
movement which the world has not yet seen,
and it is almost the only kind which The
Bulletin has any inclination to support. If
any honest and upright individual will start
an organisation for the dissemination of
Christianity among Christians, for the conver-
sion of parsons and church members, for teach-
ing the rudiments of the faith to prominent
believers, for spreading the first beginnings
of philanthropy among philanthropists, and
generally for putting things on a rational basis,
then this paper will give him its best support.
But until the pious corporation-labourer can go
disti'ict visiting at Potts Point without being
run in, and until a society of saved artizans can
start a mission to unregenerate millionaires,
and command public support and sym-
pathy instead of being set down as a
gang of lunatics and watched by the police,
it is idle to pretend that the alleged Christianity
of to-day is anything more than a compound of
vanity, intolerance, hypocrisy, and unmitigated
greed. It is because of these things that The
Bulletin has neglected to send its subscription
to any society for the spread of Christian
principles among the working classes. It will
subscribe willingly to spread Christian prin-
ciples among the society itself if it ever meets
with an organisation which is strong enough to
penetrate the rhinoceros-hide of that philan-
thropic body, but the men who could do such a
work could also remove mountains with their
naked hands, and such individuals, unhappily,
are very scarce.
A State Duty
In a case which came before one of the courts
some time ago, the law was laid down by the
Judge to be that any person who cntercd.into
the public practice of any calling must be taken
to represent himself as having reasonable skill
and knowledge in that calling, and was liable
for any damage caused by his ignorance and un-
skilfulness. The man who has his horse lamed
by the unskilfulness of the blacksmith who
shoe* it can recover compensation in a police’


court. The Bulletin would like to know
what prevents the same principle being
applied to a Judge why a man in a
horsehair wig, who, by ignorance of his
business and general dunderheacledness, puts
a suitor to an expense of hundreds of
pounds in law costa shouldn’t be subject to the
general law and be made to answer for his laches
out of his own pocket. Last week an unfortunate
New South Wales litigant named Hannan had
to pay through the nose because a Judge named
M Tael and was ignorant of the law. Hannan,
an ironworker, hail three fingers taken off by
an accident with machinery, and sued his
employers in the District Court to recover
damages. He failed to make out a case suffi-
cient in law to render the employers liable for
the injury, but Judge MVFaeland nevertheless
gave him a verdict for £l5O. Defendants ap-
pealed to the Supreme Court, who upset the
verdict with costs. Poor Hannan, a working
man, whose crippled hand no doubt seriously
curtails his power of earning a livelihood, has to
pay not only the costs of the trial in the District
Court, but also those of the proceedings in the
Appeal Court, which would never have been
entered into had the judge in the first instance
been acquainted, as it was his duty to be
acquainted, with the law bearing on the case.
** " #
The Bulletin maintains that it is a gross
travesty of justice to saddle Hannan, or any
other person in a similar position, with such
costs. If the Judge cannot be compelled to pay
then!, then they should be borne by the Govern-
ment. Hannan had nothing to do with select-
ing the Judge; he was chosen.by the Govern-
ment and kept in his position by the Government
and the Government thereby undertook to
guarantee to every citizen who came before
him, whether to prosecute or to defend a suit,
that the decision would be given by a man
who understood the law. That, at any rate,
is the position the Government ought to take
lip. It is exactly on all fours with the position
they do take up in all other departments under
Government control. Any passenger by rail-
way who takes a ticket and gets smashed up by
the carelessness or incompetence of a porter,
can send in his claim to the Government and
have it duly attended to. Why should not the
same person, if he comes before a Government
official entrusted with the administration of
justice, to maintain his legal rights, have an
equal claim on the Government if by the fault
Of that official his legal rights are denied him ?
The costs of every proceeding in a Supreme
Court which results in the reversal of an
inferior Judge’s decision on a point of law ought
to be a charge ori the consolidated revenue. It
is an impudent robbery to compel individual
suitors’to pay the expense of the legal educa-
tion of men to whom the Government choose to
entrust the duty of administering the law. The
course we suggest would be a pretty costly
business at first, but the item would be" a very
instructive one on the annual estimates, and the
evil would work its own cure. However heavy
the bill might be, it would only be putting on
the shoulders of the community generally
the burden that is now unjustly laid on the
comparatively few individuals who are un-
fortunate enough or rash enough to make the
arduous pilgrimage to the “ unpolluted fountain
of justice.” There is more than one Judge
adorning the bench who would retire precipi-
tately into private life very soon after Parlia-
ment had voted for the first time money enough
to cpver the costs of one year’s successful
appeals against his decisions. It would pay the
country handsomely to get rid of some of them,
even if they had to be given extravagant
pensions.
* # #
This is a matter that admits of fairly straight-
forward and simple enquiry. Much of the
material is on record and easily accessible. By
way of a start, let some member of Parliament
call for a return showing in detail the number
of appeals from each inferior-court Judge, the
result of such appeals, and the amount of taxed
costs in each case. That will give some sort of
basis to start with ; it will not by any means
be a measure of the mischief. For every
wrong judgment appealed against there are
probably a dozen that the unsuccessful party
has to put up with for want of the means or
the heart to carry the matter on to the Supreme
Court. The “District ”or “ County ” Court is
the poor man’s Court, and if justice is only to
be got by a second and more expensive trial
before another tribunal, nine suitors out of
ten must go without justice. Of course, this
is in some degree, and in a great degree,
true of the Supreme Court itself, but
that is not what we are at present concerned
with. The District or County Court in
all the Australian provinces disposes of
enormously more business in the year than
the Supreme Court, and though the cases, from
the point of view of the amount of money in-
volved, may be on the average less important,
yet they often mean just as much to the suitors
as the biggest Supreme Court action means to
the parties concerned in it. A £5O verdict
with costs, to many a man who rests his case
on the clear-headedness and probity of an
inferior court Judge, spells absolute and irre-
trievable ruin.
* # *
There is no need, however, to go to the
record of over-ruled judgments to arrive at the
standard of the New South Wales District
Lourt judiciary, or part of it. The facts are an
open scandal, and it is time to speak plainly
about them. There are men on the bench
whose knowledge of law is a nullity and whose
well-earned reputation in point of intelligence
and common-sense is such as to make them a
mark for the honest contempt and undisguised
derision of every practitioner who appears
before them. It is notorious that there are
even more serious grounds for dissatisfaction,
-the facts that give colour to widespread and
plain-spoken rumours of corruption must bo as
imich within the knowledge of the Minister of
j) ustice as they are within that of nearly every
lawyer or journalist or man of business in Syd-
lle.Y- That there are good men, and very good
!l lei b on the list of District Court Judges The
bulletin does not for a moment deny. More
ran one of them could be named whose eleva-
tion to the bench of the Supreme Court would
distinctly raise the standard of that body. But
some sweeping changes must be made before
the administration of the law in the secondary
courts can command public confidence.
* * *
Some changes, it would appear, are about to
be made. Judge M'Farland has started for a
six months’ holiday, and it may be presumed—
at any rate, it is to be hoped—that this merely
means six mouths’ full pay preliminary to his
retirement on a pension. If so, another Judge
will have to lie appointed in his place. The
state of business seems to require an additional
Judge besides. In the name of public decency,
to say nothing of the interests of justice, The
Bulletin demands that the positions should be
offered to the best men available at the Bar.
Two temporary appointments have been made,
and some indication ought to he given as to
whether it is the intention of the Government
to allow those appointments to become per-
manent. If so, the public are entitled to know
the esteem in which Acting-Judge Gibson and
Acting-Judge Bennett are held by those who
arc in a position to form an opinion on
the subject. It may ho that they are both
eminently fit for ti e p >sition. So far as The
Bulletin has been i bl; to learn, one of them
at least is a good lawyer, a man of sound
common-sense, and promises to command the
respect and confidence of suitors and profes-
sional men who appear before him. This may
be the case.as to both of them. It is the duty
of the Government, before taking any decisive
step, to satisfy themselves that it is. If the
Government show any remissness in the matter
it may become the duty of The Bulletin to
assist them with a little reliable and candid in-
formation.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
In lignant Sin-Shifters.
A few weeks ago Canon Barlow, an ecclesiastic
of Australian origin and education, was nomi-
nated to the bishopric of North Queensland,
and straightway the whole outraged gang of
hired prelates entered a unanimous protest and
set to work to remove the new dignitary,
“ because he had not studied at any English
University or Theological College.” That was
exactly what was the matter. Canon Barlow
was only a common Australian with a brilliant
education and first-class abilities, who had the
assurance to be offered a good billet in his own
country and by his own countrymen, and the
British devil-remover objects to any Australian
rising to eminence in his own land, so long as
there is one hungry English gospel-grinder left
who Wants a job. And not only that, but he
is so utterly devoid of intelligence and common
decency that he objects openly, being quite
unable to comprehend that the Anglican sky-
pilot has not a lien on all the payable situations
on earth, or that any other sky-pilot, born
outside the limits of England, has any rights
whatsoever. Neither can ho comprehend that
any individual can possess even the rudiments of
education unless he has studied all manner of
useless Greek and Hebrew information at an
English University, and despite his alleged
learning he has never yet realised that his
Asiatic Redeemer was not an Englishman.
Least of all can he understand that he is himself
in Australia on sufferance, and that he remains
here not because he is essential, but because he
trades on prejudice, old tradition, and human
stupidity. He is an individual with a super-
cilious British sneer, and an unfathomable
British ignorance of everything that is not
British. He comes out reluctantly, driven by
the desire to accumulate coin and fat ; he
gathers both as rapidly as he can, and snuffles
unctuously about having been called by the
Loard to toil in the vineyard ; and then, at
the earliest opportunity, he abandons the Loard
and the vineyard both, and makes tracks for the
land of his oily fathers to look for a job where
the salary is more lavish. Then another impe-
cunious bearer of good tidings arrives in his
stead, and goes through the same routine.
There is a good deal of variety about these
ephemeral individuals who come out to grab
the Evil One by the tail, but they are all
unanimous on one point—that the whole earth
belongs to the British parson, and that nobody
who has not attended an English University
knows anything at all. And as their complaint
is past all remedy, the only resource is to sack
the whole lot and let Australia grow its own
sin-shifter for the future.
Money-bags as Ruler!
“John Bergan ” writes to the S.M. Herald
quoting the late Chief Justice Martin as saying
that “ it would be a sad day for New South
Wales when universal suffrage became the law
of the land,” and asking, “ Who should rule in
a civilised community—the ignorant populace
or the cultured and socially-refined members of
its body ?” Doubting not that the latter would
be preferred by anyone of discrimination, and
jumping to the conclusion that “ property-
owners are in the vast majority of cases men
of superior intelligence to that possessed by
the proletariat,” he says,“itwas, indeed, by
virtue of their intelligence and industry, or that
of their fathers, that they have come to be pos-
sessed of landed estates. And, having an im-
portant stake in the country, being closely
identified with its national fortune, they
naturally have a deeper interest in, and a more
solicitous care for its continued well-being than
poormen. ” Inthofirst place, property-owners are
not by any means “ men of superior intelligence
and industry,” nor was it by exercise of these
faculties on their part, or those of their an-
cestors that they became possessed of landed
estate. It simply happened, in many cases, that
they or their progenitors were “lagged” to
Australia or came out in charge of “ lags,” or
ran away to sea and landed here at a time when
land could be had for a song, or when everyone
had better opportunities for grabbing up real
estate than now. But, even if they have
legitimately—that is, as legitimately as modern
environments permit—acquired landed pro-
perty, that does not enrol them either as high-
class electors or superior representatives; it
only commends them to the classes as persons
who have a vested interest iu maintaining the
injustices of the present social system. For
Government has nothing in common with com-
mercial speculation, and the very faculties
which are most necessary to succeeding in
business are complete disqualifications for the
handling of great questions in which sentiment
and passion must be taken into consideration.
Mr. Eero an gabbles of “the country.” It is
not evident whether he uses the term to
signify the land merely or the people who live
in it ; apparently, however, he simply uses the
word “ country ” as a euphemism to denote the
interests of those who have grabbed the greater
part of it and is only solicitous that the
grabbers should be placed in a position
that would enable them to annex the remainder.
We would like to make Mr. Bergan understand
that if his theory, that only the landed be fit to
rule, be carried to its legitimate conclusion,
it raises the point: How much land is
necessary to the acquirement of the intelligence
necessary for ruling? and that the minimum
being fixed and the intelligent land owners
placed in possession of the country’s destinies,
they, as lawmakers, would be able to raise that
minimum as they added acre to acre until, at
length, by judicious bribery, jobbery, usury,
and inter-marrying, only one man might own
the continent, and consequently only one man
could possibly have sufficient intelligence to
govern “the country.” This, Mr. Bergan
would doubtless consider to be representative
government of the highest class. How much
land the gentleman, with whose effusion we
have briefly dealt , owns we know not. If he
has not more land than ho has intelligence,
then he is disqualified, alike now and under the
conditions ho hankers after, from taking any
part in the government of his “ country.”
Mutual Interests.
The amiable Mr. “Toby” Barton, Q.C., in
addressing the New South Wales Sucking-
Alligators’ Association wisely remarked that
many reforms would come from the lawyers if
the public could he convinced that their interests
and the interests of the lawyers were alike. What
a beautiful illustration of this truth is the New
South Wales Probate Act ! Ostensibly intro-
duced to simplify procedure and save expense to
the public, it will take about ten years’ litiga-
tion (all in the interests of the public, of course)
to settle the vexed points of construction
that are sure to arise. The diminished expense
arises thus : Instead of feeing a junior
barrister with £1 3s. 6d., the solicitor can
move for probate himself, for which he will
charge £1 Is. Nett saving on this head—
2s. 6d. !! ! As against this will have to be put
the following items of new costs introduced by
the Act:
£ s. and.
Copy advertisement for daily paper 0 2 0
Attg. inserting and paying 0 6 8
Paid advertising... .. .. .. .. .. 0 10 0
Attg. searching for any will deposited in Regis-
trar-General’s .. .. .. .. ..068
Instructions for affidavit as to result of search ... 0 6 8
Drg. and Copy affidavit, 4 fos. .. .. ..040
Copy to swear 0 2 0
Attending swearing 0 C 8
2 4 8
Deduct saving in not feeing barrister ..020
Increased cost to the public 2 2 2
And yet the public will not be convinced that
their interests and the interests of the lawyers
are alike! It may, however, be noted that the
Supreme Court, in exercise of powers given to
it by the new Probate Act, has framed a
standing scale of costs for obtaining probate or
letters of administration as follows :
Where estate does not excetd £SOO .. 8 guineas
Over £SOO not exceeding £IOOO .. ..10 ~
„ £IO6O „ £2OOO .. .. 12 ~
~ £2OOO ~ £SOOO 15 „
„ £SOOO „ £IO,OOO .. ..20 „
„ £IO,OOO 25 „
But the proctor (i.e., the attorney) may deliver
a bill of costs and run the risk of taxation.
There are two points of interest to the general
public arising from the above scale of costs. (1)
An estate of £SOO (in many cases the sole means
of existence for a widow and children) is bur-
dened with a tax of eight guineas payable to a
greedy lawyer, and probate duty to Government
of one per cent., while the bigger the estate the
smaller proportionally to the amount are the
costs:—
Under £SOO .. .. .. 8 guineas
£IO,OOO and over .. .. .. 25 guineas
Why should a widow and children pay £8 Bs.
to a lawyer to prove to the world that they
are respectively the widow and children of
a deceased person, whose only assets are £SOO
clear? That is all obtaining letters of adminis-
tration means. The Government is much more
merciful to small estates in England and Scot-
land, and latterly in Victoria. By “the In-
testates’ Widows’ Relief Act, 1889 ” of that
province it is provided that where persons die
leaving property not exceeding £SOO in value,
the nearest County Court Registrar shall till up
the advertisements, affidavits and documents
requisite to obtain probate upon the application
of the person entitled to probate and shall
transmit to the Master-in-Equity all such
papers, with the fees. After examination the
Master-in-Equity may issue a grant of
probate to the County Court Registrar
for the applicant. The fees payable to
the Registrar are five shillings where
estate does not exceed £SO, and 2s. Gd. for every
further £SO. This piece of Victorian legislation
followed upon similar legislation in England
and Scotland, and the Victorian Legislature
have further enacted—s 3 Viet., No. 1053 —that
deceaseds’ estates of over £IOOO are alone liable
to probate duty. In New South Wales, when
a widow wants to deal with her deceased
husband’s estate of £SOO, she is bled by the
lawyers to the tune of £8 Bs., and by the
Government to the tune of £5 for probate duty,
while in Victoria she will only pay altogether
17s. fid. When some disinterested legal M.L. A.
or M. L.C. will bring in and carry through acouple
of little bills on Victorian lines to prevent widows
and orphans from being fleeced by the lawyers,
the public may be gradually educated into-
believing that their interests and the interests
of the lawyers are alike. Meanwhile, the
public simply rise and enquire, “ What are you
giving us? ”
Seven Guineas’ Worth, of Justice.
Cornelius Bourke, a septuagenarian “ chronic”
convict who capped his long criminal record by
kicking to death Charles Stewart, an ancient
fellow-prisoner of similar brand, has been
sentenced to bo hanged. The circumstances
surrounding his trial and conviction will bear a
little thinking over, and may suggest to some
minds mixed sentiments towards the enlight-
ened and impartial administration of justice
which Australia enjoys. Cornelius Bourke
was a pauper felon before he developed into a
prison murderer. The Victorian Crown Law
Department, with some show of fairness,
allotted him lawyers for his defence. That
task was entrusted to Attorneys Samuel and
Horwitz, who sought to engage the veteran
advocate Barrister M‘Dermott. The Crown
Law Department, however, sooner or later in-
formed Samuel and Horwitz that it never
allowed more than seven guineas for the defence
of any Circuit Court capital case—it being ap-
parently expected that a penniless accused
man, with his neck in the noose, ought to be
satisfied with local talent or with the services
of some young barrister already attending the
circuit ! Samuel and Horwitz eventually
entrusted the defence of Bourke to Barrister
T. G. Grand, who made “ a brilliant but ineffe-
tual defence. ’ Notwithstanding the possibility
that the more experienced Mr. M'Dermott
could not have done better than Mr. Grand, it
is evident that the Crown Law Department, in
a spirit of economy, circumscribed what
Bourke’s solicitors believed to be his chances of
escape, and the picture will obtrude itself upon
an active imaginat ion that officialdom indecently
hankered after the neck of an anticipated
victim. For many years penniless prisoners on
trial for their lives were allowed by the Crown
to appear undefended at the bar ; now in N.S.
Wales —chiefly, we are proud to feel, through the
continued representations of this paper —15
guineas is allowed for their defence in every
case, which sum, though proportionately cpiite
insufficient, affords a promise of better things.
In Victoria—where’also the Crown sticks at no
expense to secure a prisoner’s conviction —seven
guineas is set down as enough to counterbalance
the huge expenditure made by Government in
endeavouring to prove the guilt of a possibly
innocent man who is all the time under
lock-and-key. It may be urged that the
Crown-Prosecutor does not really prose-
cute but only endeavours to elicit the
truth. The same plea is made for the police.
But human nature has to be considered. We
are all sportsmen. Again, Barrister Grand
sought to have Bourke’s trial postponed, both
on the ground of his not having had time
to fully acquaint himself with the facts of
the case, and because the prisoner’s solicitors
had received no reply to their application to
the Crown Law Department to have Bourke’s
sanity tested. The Judge, in refusing the
application, is reported by the Hamilton
Spectator to have said—
The affidavit on behalf of the accused only disclosed
that the solicitors for the prisoner had not~used that
promptitude which they ought to have done. If they
thought there were reasonable grounds for having the
prisoner examined by medical experts with regard to his
sanity, the application should have been made in Mel-
bourne at a much earlier date.
The penniless wretch, Bourke, was thus con-
fessedly subjected to a trial for which his
counsel was unprepared, as a punishment for
the alleged neglect of solicitors over whom he
could exercise no influence !
The Pillory in Court.
Chief Justice Higinbotham’s decision that
James Mirams who, while undergoing a sen-
tence, is summoned to give evidence in some
civil litigation, must appear in Court in prison
garb on the ground that his conviction affects
his credibility as a witness, and that the jury
must not be allowed to overlook this aspect of
the case by his appearing in ordinary clothes, is
one which The Bulletin hopes to see recon-
sidered. Is not the discount implied in the
witness’s inevitable admission—“My name is
James Mirams ; I am now a prisoner serving a
sentence for such-and-such an offence ”—suffi-
cient for all the purposes of justice ? Let us
assume that Mirams has already served his
sentence and appears in the witness-box in
ordinary clothes, will the Judge order him to
leave Court and attire himself in prison raiment
under the direction of the police, so that his evi-
dence may be discounted by a visible and material
instead of by a merely moral evidence of his lapse?
At what point, for the purposes of a right appre-
ciation of evidence tendered by an imprisoned
witness, is the line logically to be drawn be-
tween the period at which a man convicted of
an offence is to be pilloried in Court for that
offence and the period at which his evidence
may be tendered by him out of the pillory and
subject only to such discount as may accrue
from the statement of his former conviction ?
Arraigned prisoners are unduly prejudiced by
being placed, like wild beasts, behind the bars
of a cage. It is enough that they be prejudiced
by the readiness of human nature to at once
believe guilty the man who is accused of a
crime, in opposition to the maxim of law' which
holds all men innocent till they are proved
guilty. And is it not enough that witnesses
from prison appear in custody and admit their
conviction? Such admissions address them-
selves to the intellectual perceptions of jury-
men as well as to their prejudices ; but prison-
clothes appeal, and appeal persistently, to
human prejudices alone.

It becomes necessary once more to clutch David
Syme, of the Age, as he is rushing over a pre-
cipice, and ask him what he means ? In a
leading article last week he says that the old
system of carrying appeals to the Privy Council
at the other end of the globe must be main-
tained because Australians find it “no slight
advantage to have 1, r,i -class legal ability and
undoubted impartiality kept ready for their
use in the solution of difficult and intricate
cases.” Now, in the first place, we would like
Mr. Syme to explain why a British Judge must
be a first-class Dwyer any more than a British
Commander-in-Chief is a first-class General, for
it seems to us that the country which grew
Field-Marshal Gamp can produce a very reason -

able crop of fools when it wants to. Moreover,
the present Chancellor is admittedly a dead
failure, and the present British Attorney-
General is a snivelling nobody, who was lately
thrown out of court by.an usher because he had
had so little practice that he was absolutely
unknown even to the door-keepers, and these
two lawyers don’t amount to much to begin
with. Secondly, if the Australian Courts are
not as impartial as those of any other country
in the world, Mr. Syme might kindly state the
fact openly. And lastly, if it is “no slight
advantage ” that any poor man, who has with
great difficulty and expense secured justice in a
court of law, can be bounced out of that justice
because his opponent has money enough to take
the case to a court 16,000 miles away, and he
hasn’t money enough to follow it there, then it
would also be a blessed thing for Mr, Syme to
have his dinner removed 16,000 miles away,
and it would be “ no slight advantage” for him
to have to walk after it or go without. Victuals
and common justice are two things that ought
always to be close at hand, and if Mr. Syme
found that his only available grub was at the
other extremity of the globe, lie would realise
this fact quite suddenly.
Mb. Whixon, who has become violently loyal
ever since he went “home,” and made an
exceedingly weak speech before the Privy
Council, is of opinion that the system of carry-
ing appeals to that very expensive, slow, and
inefficient tribunal is “ one of the noblest
characteristics of the empire”—whatever that
may mean—and should lie maintained because,
among other things, it enables “ legal gentle-
men in this country ” to “take advantage of a
valuable judicial literature.” Taking advantage
of a valuable literature is a good phrase, but we
would suggest that Mr. Whixon would have
got there just the same if he had stated that the
system enabled a lawyer to travel 32,000 miles
in all, at the expense of a ruined client, and
look at a book at the other end of the journey.
The same gaudy statesman complains that it
would be difficult to constitute an Australian
court of appeal ! ‘ sufficiently strong to command
the confidence of the Courts whose decisions it
would overrule.” Well, did any Court ever
command the confidence of any other Court
whose decisions it overruled? And if it did,
then where in the name of all that is wonderful
is that Court ? And if it didn’t command the
confidence, &c., it would run the show all the
same. Generally the under dog in a fight
seems to have very little confidence in the dog
on top, but that doesn’t affect the result.
Whixon was always a washy individual, and he
is steadily deteriorating until he becomes pain-
ful to listen to.
“The Dictionary of Chestnuts” is anew

The Municipal Council of Cotton, Mississippi,

the old gaol. 3. That the old gaol be used till

Dear Bulletin, —Your bright little Mel'
bourne contemporary, Bohemia, remarks, apropos
to the “ Equality of States,” or State-right ques-
tion, upon which the Convention threatens to
split, that : “Strangely enough, little or nothing
was said about this point beforehand.” Consider-
ing the statement with reference to the politicians,
it is true, but not, by any means, strange. The
politicians, much as they have gassed about
Federation, have been almost to a man (if we are
to*judge by their public utterances) ignorant of
federal principles and past and existing federal
Constitutions. This could hardly have been the
case had the movement which has produced the
Convention had its origin in the necessities and
desires of the people. It did not originate in the
people—-it had its fons et origo in the bread-and-
butter-miss vanity of Sir Henry Parkes and in the
cunning which passes with him and his followers
as parliamentary strategy. The question of State-
rights I, myself, indicated, in a communication to
The Bulletin as far back as August, 1887, would
prove the crux of the federal problem, and I was
glad to know that you adopted my view in dis-
cussing, last year, the work of the Melbourne
Conference. Unless the States have an admitted
equality, sooner or later there must be secession
by the weaker and numerieally-smaller States.
But the very essence of a Federal Union is, say
the jurists, its indissolubility. The stronger
congeries of States would prevent the seces-
sion of the weaker ones by coercion. This was
the course in America —this will, of a certainty,
be the course in Australia if a federation be
created in which this contingency is not distinctly
faced. A quiet worker for Federation for many
years past, and a dreamer for more over its possi-
bilities, I would rather these provinces were never
federated than that the Union should at some
future time be compelled to pass through a bloody
ordeal similar to that of the U.S. There would
be some hope of constructing an enduring union
if the possibility of severance were provided for —
none without. In the absence of a President,
who would represent the people of all the States
—the Governor-General would represent the
Crown and not the people-—the Senate or Council
of States will have to be the governor-valve of
the Constitution. Throw it out of gear, as you
would do if you refuse to each State the
Sovereignty of an entity and equality with each
other, and you will have an explosion. At the
moment of writing a failure in formal result to
the Convention’s deliberations seems imminent.
But I, for one, will hold that it lias done good
work in demonstrating how great is the need for
education in the principles and history of Federal
Constitution. One word in conclusion the
example of the Swiss might be followed in
deliberation on financial topics by an Australian
Federal Parliament. Let both Houses delibei’ate
in common, but vote separately. Then State in-
terests and popular interests would be able to
grapple with each other at the moment, instead of
being left to adopt, so to speak, an cx-officio
antagonism, while the separate-vote-registrations
would still give the amplest freedom to State
powers on the one hand and popular powers on
the other. - Yours, &c., W.A.

Forty members of the N.S.W. Freetrado

Parkes on his Federal policy—whether under a
Frcctrade or Protectionist regime.
President Parkes was by no means a

to be constantly on hand to prompt him.

Sir Samuel Griffith’s Convention remarks

A Bourke (N.S.W.) public meeting has
endorsed the. view that Government is congesting
that district with unemployed labour by means of
free-passes with these objects in view : —“ (1.) To
get rid of them from Sydney. (2.) To ensure the
loss of their votes next election. (3.) To flood the
local labour market with pauper labour in order
to overawe the local unionists when the shearing
struggle reaches here.”
Purves, the Australian Native, has been
complaining to a few of his young Melbourne
admirers that not half-a-dozen members of the
Federal Convention would have been chosen by a
plebiscite of the whole Australian people. Most
of the delegates, says the irate jury “ kidder,” are
place-hunters, who, by dint of unscrupulous devo-
tion to the interests of limited localities, have
been pitchforked into authority in local parlia-
ments.
Speaker “Joe” Abbott in his Convention
speech “ protested against the Republican spirit
which was growing up in this community among
the thoughtless.” We can quite understand Mr.
Joe Abbott’s virtuous indignation. Under a
Republic, the inevitable Sir Joseph Abbott (or
will it be Sir Palmer ?—there would be historical
precedent on the N.S.W. Bench for the “Palmer”
instead of the Joseph) would be plain “Joe”
without trimmings.
The Bulletin, representing the whole of
Australasia, and not merely a part of it, and
standing on a plane superior to local jealousies,
will hail any form of Australian Federation with
some degree of satisfaction —but only as an in-
stalment of future achievement, the ultimate and
inevitable translation of the motto, “ One People,
One Destiny,” being the Australian Republic, an
Independent Nation co-equal with all other
Great Powers of the world.
From the present attitudes of delegates to
the Federal Convention it Would appear likely that
the Parliaments of South and West Australia will
decline, while New South Wales, -Victoria,

delegates (in effect) that he did not care a rap
for South Australia or West Australia so long as*
the big ! uns of the group were willing to lump
their destinies and their debts.

Says the Aoe ;
No one can affect to believe that Australians are pre-
pared to abandon that mode of envernment which in
England has stood the wear and tear of centuries in
favour of any foreign expedient, and it is therefore idle to
introduce the American form of executive for local
imitation.

Dibbs was on the ball at the Convention*
He played the Republic gently on them, like the
nigger whose master had only t» o oxen, and, says
Sambo, “Massa, one ob your bullocks am dead—

you couldn’t bear it.” But, Dibbs, neither Sydney
nor Melbourne can be the Capital. Look at the
U.S. with its Washington, and Canada, with the
Parliament at Ottawa, for such jealousies can
never be got over. So we’ll have to go to Went-
worth or Albury, Cooper’s Greek or Menindie.
Perhaps even to cheeky Warrnambool.
In the coffin containing the cremated

“ the corpse’s ” own orders, a large, piece of lead
inscribed with a statement of the cremation, ‘" in

discovered to be empty.” .What egotism! Ihe
ground-down dock-labourer who contemptuously
kicks open Bedford’s coffin twenty years hence
when the Social Revolution comes round will say,
taking up the lead: “He was a brutal miser, a
slave-master to his tenants, a murderer of the
poor—look ! this is his heart.”
Just consider the bare possibility of the
Prince of Wales mounting the Throne ! And we
are in duty bound also to imagine Prince Albert
Victor as a full-blown monarch, in a gold crown
and purple robe, with the orb in his left hand and
sceptre in his right, and a bundle of cigarettes in
a left-hand pocket somewhere. The absurdity
will be too monstrous if Wales becomes Ills
Majesty. Just fancy the coronation ! Tickets of
Victoria’s are yet preserved, inscribed by Her
Sacred Majesty. His Sacred Majesty! Talk
about Sancho Panza in Barataria ! Now, there is
some lingering aureole of reflected sunset glory
about Victoria, but Wales seems to be a mere
gentleman—as the word is understood in card-
playing circles.
J. Greeley Jenkins, successor to the late
David Bews as S. A. Minister for Education, is
evidently a thoroughbred mongrel. He was born
in Pennsylvania, Yankeeland, is generally referred
to by his brother Parliamentarians as “the Cana-
dian,” and on last St. David’s Day publicly re-
joiced in a Taffy speech that ho was a Welshman.
He used to be a “book-fiend,” and is long and
lank, with a hide like hardened asphalte and a
cheek that would defy a skewer. He is a land-
taxer, which Premier Playford isn’t, and is sup-
posed to be a cyclonic social revolutionist. This
is the sort of hybrid who generally becomes a
K.C.M.G., and refers to the common working
pusson with “orty contemp.” If he lives long
enough he will probably be Sir J.G.J. and want
to found a dynasty.
lb was probably for self-advertisement that
the Federation Convention agreed to admit press
reporters. The public simply ignore the proceed-
ings. If there were no newspapers in Sydney, not
a hundred of the population would know that
such a body as the Convention was sitting in the
city. Public enthusiasm is utterly absent. The
spasm at the banquet was confined to the
banqueters. Not a single publican has thrown
open his bar free for five minutes during the Con-
vention’s period ; and we call that a sure sign of
public indifference. There hasn’t even been a
new temperance drink named after the Conven-
tion, nor a new brand of Convention cigarettes
started. The new N.S.W. Governor weeks ago
called into existence “ Jersey ” hotels and
“Jersey” pie-shops, &c., but we haven’t heard of
even a Convention coffee-stall.
The Sydney crowd is now in the humour
to hear nobody. It won’t even listen to John
Haynes, whose chairman was the other night kid-
napped by order of the Pope. John’s voice was
drowned in cat-calls, and a ham-fisted heavy-
weight from the Vatican named Sullivan mounted
the platform and threatened the Mudgee states-
man with personal violence when the latter melo-
dramatically trampled on a piece of green ribbon.
John shouldn’t have done that—he looks as Irish
as John M‘Elhone, or Grattan Riggs, or Cardinal
Moran, and couldn’t be made to look other than a
good Roman Catholic by a Federal Convention
of theatrical costumiers backed up by Barber
Wigzell and the Council. “D n
Haynes !” said the meeting, swinging its little
flour-bag:. Then the lights were put out, and
John’s scheme to divert the nation’s indifference
from the Federal Convention to himself perished
in one act.
It is daily becoming more apparent
the paramount economic questions of the day
must be settled in the legislatures everywhere.
The power of Capital to misuse and enslave
Labour enu be effectually destroyed only by legis-
lation. In other words, the relations between
Capital and Labour must be State-regulated. But
who is to regulate the State ? In the case of
Queensland, this query involves the whole electoral
position of the shearers. These useful labourers
may be colonists of years’ standing, but, unless
they can prove six-months’ continuous residence
m one electorate, they have no votes for any
electorate, and consequently no share in what we
have termed regulating the State. This injustice
should be remedied before the next Queensland
elections, it possible. Anyhow, a long continuance
of the present strike-camps would fulfil the
electoral conditions, so far as the Barcoo district
is concerned, and “ Merino ” Murphy, M.P., as
one. deplorable specimen of a tyrannical class,
would finger no more three-hundreds for helping
-to legislatively “ put the comtther ” on Labour.

his natural ponderosity than usual. So far as we
know there is only one Mephistopheles in Aus-
tralia. As for the Valentine of Fred. England,
a hard-working and painstaking performer, con-
sideration for his feelings prevents us voicing
our sentiments. Cicely Staunton’s Siebel was a
bit weak. By the way, is it usual for posy-
picking lovers to back them up with lace-paper
after the manner of the florists ? The “ Soldiers’
Chorus ” was fairly delivered, but the orchestra
again showed signs of numerical weakness, and
the dancing was a sight for gods and men. “ Fra
Liavolo ” will be played on Friday and Saturday,
and “Martha” and “Maritana” will probably
play time out. Johnny Sheridan, who has just
arrived from Auckland by the ’Frisco mail, opens
in “ Bridget O’Brien, Esq.,” on Saturday week.

The Jerseys didn’t seem to care much for
Maggie Moore’s blood-thrilling rendering of the
“Wearing of the Green” at Her Majesty’s
“ Arrah-na-Pogue matinee of last week. Therein
they showed either great disloyalty or a lack of
acquaintance with court proceedings for Queen
Victoria condescended to shed tears oyer the same
inflammatory ballad at Balmoral quite recently.
During the week “Arrah-na-Pogue” and “The
Colleen Bawn ” have run on alternate evenings,
but the bill will be changed on Saturday for a five
nights run of “ The Daughter of the Regiment ”
and “The Fool of the Family,” in order to give
our Maggie another show of displaying her versa-
tility ere she skips further down Pitt-street. A
sacred concert, under tiie management of Charles
Huenerbein, takes place on Good Friday night,
when Mrs. Williamson makes her first Sydney
show in the “sacred,” and “My Jack” (we
doubt the wisdom of this revival) will be put up
for Easter.

“ School ” goes largely as ever at Sydney
Criterion. Dot Boucicault’s Krux is, probably,
the performance of the piece, but everyone is good,
though the schooldame of Miss Romer seemed to
lack the icy primness that, to us, seems the
character’s keynote. The Beau of George Anson
is a little broader than of yore, and the convincing
touch of the performance occurs when the old
man, yearning for his lost gran d-d au g h ter, turns
inquiringly to her mate, Pattie Brown, and
receives her sobbing reply on his shoulder. The
acting on both sides, in gesture, facial expression,
and voice inflection, is perfect, and only the
shallowest and flintiest could fail to be stirred by
it. “School,” curiously enough, will be closed
by “ The Schoolmistress,” a play by Pinero, pro-
duced by Minnie Palmer some years ago in
Melbourne, at the Bijou, we believe.
Business is all right at Sydney Royal
where Bland Holt, in order to rest Beelzebub,
probably, unfurls the “Union Jack,” next Satur-
day night for a breather of five nights, ere stag-
ing “The Golden Ladder,” the well-written play
that was too quiet for Melbourne Alexandra
audiences.

At Sydney School of Arts business is brisk,
Of the new people, “Little Elsie” is a clever
child, whose songs might be more intelligently
selected. Eva Germain, “the india-rubber lady,”
is shapely and sinuous. George Williamson
dances well in the big shoes, has a fine large voice,
and a fine old stock of chestnuts. The importation
from London, via Melbourne Gaiety, Lionel
Lambert, is a very “ikey” gentleman, whose
talents run in a distinctly Cockneyish grove.
Manager Tracey asserts that Lambert receives as
salary £3O weekly. If so, then be receives at
least ,half-a-crown too much; but even if he
receives a much less sum, then people who go full
of extravagant expectations raised by the an-
nouncement are likely to decry even the
moderate ability he possesses. Therefore, the
management, from either standpoint, is faulty.
Charles Failing’s “ Hypnotism ” is funny enough
to make a cat laugh, but wo would request that
intelligent “ black-face,” one of our brightest and
most original Ethiopians, to give Max Adder a
rest.

At Sydney Gaiety, Lizzie Hastings’ “Picnic
Party,” a crowd made up of new arrivals and a
draft from Harry Rickards’ disbanded company,
including Fred Davys, Georgie Devoe, Emmy
Morrison, Steve Adson, and others, has taken the
town by storm. The show opened on first night
to a big house with a Very fine lady leg-show, and
the usual minstrel chair-singing, when Madame
Ootavia gave- evidence of the possession of a care-
fully-trained and sweet soprano voice. Then
Fred. Spencer, the possessor of a natural chest
baritone of great power and sweetness, finally
convinced ns that he is good enough to sing any-
where, in any company, and caused folks to ask
why managers continue to employ mere names with
worn-out voices behind them when such a magni-
ficent organ, like the Town Hall one, is to let.
Lizzie Hastings is a bright, attractive, and well-

The Montague-Turner company are an-
nounced to re-appear at Brisbane Opera House at
Faster. It was here that Annis Montague so com-
pletely broke down a few months ago. The
B. aiid B. contingent—Messrs. Corlesse, Cath-
cart Ward, Cates, Brough, Leopold, Mrs. Brough,
and the Misses Taylor and Seccombe—arrived in
Brisbane last Friday and just had time to rehearse
and go on in “She Stoops To Conquer ” before a
big house. The Lynch Bellringers are playing at
the Gaiety, and the Harmston benefit, intended
to repair the damage caused by vexatious legal
proceedings, was a success. The father of the
wounded boy has compromised the matter,

Frances Saville’s farewell benefit, on March
21, at Sydney Town Hall, is under the patronage
of the Countess of Jersey. Australia’s favourite
vocalist has been at all times ready to use her
voice in aid of charity and professionals in distress,
therefore it is only natural that the cream of the
profession should have volunteered their assistance
for Saturday night. The beneficiaire will sing
several arias from grand opera and some of the
ballads she has made so popular, Mr. Alex. Reay
will disturb the sleeping organ on two occasions,
and 13 other items will be given by the pick of
Sydney’s vocal and instrumental talent.

The company at Melbourne Princess’ is
fining down towards vanishing-point, and ere
another couple of centuries have passed over
Williamson and Garner’s heads the plots of their
comic operas will be interpreted by imperceptible
atoms. The eye of future generations will have
nothing save chorus, scenery, and effects left to
dwell upon. Faint sounds of voices may still pro-
ceed from the centre of the stage, but when the
orchestra has accompanied invisibility right
through a favourite number the audience will
search in vain for something tangible to encourage
with a double encore. The very motive and the
cue for passion, as expressed in floral tributes,
will then have gone forever, and if, perchance,an
ardent admirer of nobody at all should hurl a
wreath of roses at a orima-donna who isn’t there,
the odorous vegetables will lie and wither in the
footlights’ glare, like tokens of affection on a
lonely grave. This is what things are coming to
at the most elegantly-appointed theatre in Aus-
tralia. Saturday’s revival of “ Pepita ” was dis-
tinctly Lilliputian in its tendencies—a woeful
falling off in size and weight from the show of
some two or three years back. Then Nellie
Stewart and Fannie Liddiard represented the two
syrens who go gavotting around marble halls in
regimentals, whilst those doddering lunatics, their
husbands, make feeble attempts to understand
what it all means. Flora Graupner now officiates as
pritna-donna, and as anything in the shape of a full
sized foster-sister would swamp Flora, so to speak,
little Miss Violet Varley lias been suddenly
elevated to the position of Inez, Violet is more
generously proportioned about the head and lower
extremities than Flora, but otherwise they match
very nicely, and create a harmonious effect until
somebody gets in front and blots them out of
observation. It is when they are left alone with
Elton, and all three of them begin trotting up and
down the stage, that a fellow rubs his eyes and
wonders how long the human race will remain
discoverable without the aid of a microscope.
Elton’s inimitable Pataques, which seems funnier
than ever in itself, otherwise suffers from a want
of strong contrast, because Lombardos is not so
big as he used to be. Ryley sings and plays
brightly, however. For the rest Leumane (in
Woodfield’s old part, he played it throughout
the Sydney season) seems to have struck a talent
for broad fooling, and Howard Vernon reappears
to advantage in the character of the other hus-
band, the one that murders a stuffed bull in the
arena, and is hailed as Prince Consort of the
Canary Islands. “Pepita” is again gorgeously
put upon the stage, and would be all very fine and
large throughout, but for the physical peculiarities
aforementioned.

“The Fortune of War ” is blazing away
to fair business at Melbourne Royal, but patronage
is none too liberal, considering the quantity of
crackers and strong drink which the French army
gets through every night. Unfortunately for this
drama, the Australian public are indisposed to
dote on the military, and even the spectacle of
General Sass haranguing his regiment from the
top of a tame old horse fails to send a thrill
through the house. Neither is it possible for any
sane person to feel excited when a lot of gallant
fellows are crossing over a deep ravine on a bridge
of ice, because they could jump the gap, if neces-
sary. All things considered, though, “The
Fortune of War ” is a good show, full of real
interest in the second act, and decidedly original
at all points. It is a pity, a great pity, that the
principals have such a terrible lot to say about the
ridiculous coloured duster, tied to a pole, which
impersonates the Flag of France.

At Melbourne Alexandra they withdrew
“The Miner’s Right” on Monday, and put up
“Shamus O’Brien ” in honour of St. Patrick, a
gintleman who used to see snakes. Shamus will
be stoushing the perfidious Saxon until Dampier’s
new drama is ready to astonish the natives, and
to-morrow’s (Friday) performance is for the Fire-
men’s benefit.

Melbourne held itself aloof from “Devil
Caresfoot ” and the Bijou soon presented such a
bleak appearance inside that the management
fixed up “Forget-Me-Not” for Saturday night.
Very little financial benefit is likely to result from
this change. Those who remember Genevieve
Ward and W. H. Vernon will neither enthuse
over Miss Achurch nor tolerate Charles Oharring-
ton. The latter courts ridicule in his attempt to
assume the savoir faire of an experienced man of
pleasure like Sir Horace Welby. In his natural
state Charrington is always more or less of a
Wesleyan missionary, walking, talking, smiling,
and breathing like a sanctimonious young man
whose moral being has been suddenly excited by
half-a-glass of sherry. It is impossible to accept
him as a polished roue of 25 years’ standing, or to
imagine that he ever travelled anywhere without
a bundle of tracts in his tail-pocket. Only
when he borrows a wig, an artificial manner
of speaking, and somebody else’s gestures dpes
Charrington cease to irritate the ungodly majority
of mankind. Miss Achurch is apparently at great
pains to be different to Genevieve Ward in the
name part. Her Forget-Me-Not is a brazen-
faced demi-mondaine, with pale-brick red hair and
all the colours of the rainbow on her back. There
is no touch of pathos in her references to her
shame—nothing witching or womanly about her
to explain why she hasn’t come down to the gutter
long before the curtain rises. She is merely
a melodramatic “bad lot,” rather monotonous in
the first two acts, and very powerful (on stagey
lines) when she becomes frightened of the Guy
Fawkes spy who would have her blood if he knew
where to find it. But this scene has already been
played by Miss Achurch in “Two Nights in
Rome.” The music of Genevieve’s every word,
and the finished style of Vernon, made the long
dialogues of “Forget-Me-Not” intensely in-
teresting. They are tiring now. Miss Achuroh
uses her hardest nutmeg-grater-tones all the time,
and Charrington is hopeless entirely. The only
other character of any importance —that of Alice
Verney—falls to Miss Emma Bronton, and her
voice assists to make matters depressing. Flem-
ming, as the vindictive Guy Fawkes, and George
Leitch, in his old capacity of Prince Malleotti,
are there when wanted. The Achurch season.has
started badly. They might try “ A Doll’s House ”
and a newspaper controversy on the good old
marriage question.

At the Opera House interesting events are
coming off shortly. Next Saturday a Mr. Ernest
Edmunds will produce a comic-opera called
“Phyllis,” and a MissHarrießandell is to appear
in large capitals and the name-part. “Phyllis,”
however, is only to last five nights. On the
following Saturday the MacMahons open a fresh
case of opera in conjunction with Miss Clara
Merivale. All the available “Paul Jones”
people, also Knight Aston and John Forde, are
down on the new list, and the fun starts with
“Falka.”

Meanwhile the halls—Gaiety and Vic.—
are keeping the ghost up to his weekly promenade,
and the Waxworks manager has hired several
boxes of preserved dead body, including an
Egyptian gentleman who was on speaking terms
with Moses and Aaron, and a “ beautiful squaw ”
from a cave in North America. There is a small
breakage just below the left ribs of the lovely
squaw, and if you enquire hard into the matter
you can catch a glimpse of her soul. It is black
and ragged, like the underneath part of a mush-
room. The Cyclorama folks have been celebrating
the birthday of Jeremiah Brown once more, and
it appears that this imperishable Waterloo veteran
is 99. So next year he will be 126. The Aquarium
alligator and other trifles are alleged to be doing
well.

The mania for “nights” at Melbourne
Princess’ has extended to the soft-goods trade.
A mob of pushing young parties took possession
of the amphitheatre last Thursday and hung out
their banners. They also kicked up too much
row, and in a general way made objects of them-
selves. What the world really wants to make it
happy is an Associated Undertakers’ night, with
rollicking graveyard ditties between the acts. O
Victor Daley, Victor Daley, are you listening ?

A mining speculator from Broken Hill took
two seats to see “ Devil Caresfoot ” at Melbourne
Bijou—one seat for himself and the other for his
dog. After the first act the dawg took his
master out to get a drink, but as they were
sauntering back to their seats Manager Mayne
objected to the faithful quadruped on the ground
that he might applaud at the wrong time. The
usual “ unpleasantness ” terminated in the arrest
of the speculator from Broken Hill, who now
talks of bringing an action against somebody,
because one act of “Devil Caresfoot” gave poor
Tiny the distemper.

The Age has just discovered that Char-
rington is “ irremediably ‘ sticket,’ colorless, and
feeble beyond all comparison. His style is like
the even flow of a shallow, pellucid stream. He
acts like a well-favoured lay-preacher assisting at
an amateur performance,” &c., &c. How different
this notice to the greasy compliments bestowed on
Charrington by this same Age at a time when
The Bulletin was labelling Charrington as a
curate ! The daily papers always start by tell-
ing lies, and seldom have the pluck to stick to ’em.

“Dramaticus” wishes to state that there has Deen
another theatrical in the Victorian Legislature, besides
Goppin, viz., Mark Last King, known in the palmy ante-
Brooke days as Morton King, the Hamlet and Shylock of
his day. He was an auctioneer afterwards with the firm
of Gibbon and King, Bourke-street, and delighted to sit
daily on the District Court bench, with Call or Panton.
Nesbitt and King used to be the great battle of the
cognoscenti, when Charley Young and Johnny Hydes
managed the Melbourne Queen’s.
Mr. and Mrs. Harwood—Docy Stewart, Nellie’s half
eister—leave for England on a pleasure trip, though
H.R.H. means to dabble in biz a bit, alongside of Amory
Sullivan, Coppin’s skirmisher and feeler for the Melbourne
Royal. The Harwoods have lived in retirement at his
villa of Montreux, Heidelberg way, bub men of his sort
chafe over absolute quietude. “ Spagnoletti ”, doesn’t
think Harwood ever played Hamlet, but he has acted
nearly every other male part in the piece. Docy
(Theodosia) aud Maggie Stewart are the children of our
old friends Mr. and Mrs. Guerin, while Nellie and Dick
are the children of Mr. and Mrs. Stewart (Mrs. Guerin.)

The convict-hulk Success was exhibited with great
success in Port Melbourne a few weeks back, which leads
the entrepreneurs to a bold move. They have fitted up
the cells with “ the real implements of torture,” chains,
and what not, also waxworks of the celebrated old-time
prisoners, in their own clothes, and are going to take the
Success to London for exhibition. They aren’t taking a
success to London ; they are taking what is bound to be,
for 500 reasons, a ghastly failure there. And what a
lovely idea this is—to open up in England the Australian
gaol-industry!
Dear Bulletin,— In a “Poverty Point” paragraph
anent Charles Cartwright’s performance in “The Middle-
man,” your contributor says Ask his comrade, Sass,
how honest Cartwright stood in London when he left ?
Was he reckoned ‘in it’ with Warner and Terriss?”
(names that one seldom sees coupled). Your contributor
might as well ask how honestTitheradge stood in London
two months before he gave us his fine Wilfred Denver ?
It seems to me that Cartwright has natural qualifications
for his part in “ The Middleman,” and can probably play
that particular part better than a stronger all-round actor
might. Your paragraph refers to Willard as a dramatic
genius, but I remember to have seen him give a very
weak representation of Sir Harcourt Courtly, at a Gaiety
matinee. “Good parts make good actors,” it is true.
Only a small percentage of actors, however, can make as
much of a star character as Cartwright makes of Cyrus
Blenkarn, either with original conceptions or otherwise.

London Critic Archer has been trying to select the
plays that will endure. Cannot be sure of any produced
since Bulwer’s. What a satire on the glory of the modern

deceptive, based on falsity and lust ; purity of language
is insisted on, also pruriency of idea.
The proposed new Melbourne theatres have gone bung
—i.e., that on the Russell-street corner, and that in
Collins-street—but, consequent on Coppin’s announce-
ment of a gutting of the Royal, there comes another,
that the Opera House is to be entirely pulled down and
rebuilt, and to be made, at a cost of £50,000, the most
superb house in Australia. The new house will go right
through from Bourke to Little Collins street, on the
same high level as the Theatre Royal, with a magnificent
stage, and unrivalled dressing-rooms. The new Opera
House will also be much more handy to Bourke-street, in
front, with exits equal to the Princess and Alexandra.
Georgina Burns (Carl Rosa Co.) recently sued the

ordinary citizens, to criticise any kind of public per-
former - using the term in its widest sense—favourably or
unfavourably, wisely or foolishly, justly or unjustly, so
long as the criticism is fair—that is, so long as it is criti-

criticism, and so long as it is an expression of opinion

Hugh James Vincent O’Ferral, the dash-
ing sportsman who 16 years ago created a sensa-
tion in Melbourne by bolting from the Crown
Lands Office where he had embezzled £20,000 of
Government money, died quietly in Melbourne
the other day. Long before his conviction he built
a row of houses which he called “Vincent
Terrace,” and there he ended his days. When he
made himself scarce he fled to New Caledonia,
where he lived in the bush for a long time and
was in imminent danger of perishing. He
managed, however, to get to the Straits Settlements
and was arrested in Singapore by the local police.
He got nine years’ gaol, and from the dock told
the miserable story of his wanderings after his
flight. He served only about four years of his
time, and was liberated on account of failing
health. Of late years he was so altered and broken-
down that he could walk down Collins-street at
high noon without being recognised.
A love-letter of the First Napoleon has
just come to light. It is dated from Verona, “1
frimaire, 1796,” and addressed to the “ Citoyenne
Bonaparte, Milan.” “I am just going to bed,
my little Josephine,” it begins, “ with a heart full
of thy adorable image, and torn with pain to be
so long away from you ; hut I hope in a few days
to be more fortunate, and to be able to tell you
face to face how I love you. You never write to
me, you think no more of your good husband,
cruel woman ! Don’t you know that without you,
without your heart, your love, there is no rest for
your poor husband ; no happiness, no life even ?
Heavens ! how I wish I could be with you this
minute and act femme de chambre, and see the neat
little white shoulders, the pretty little face set off
by its Creole kerchief. Life, fortune, pleasure,
all are to me such as you make them. To be with
Josephine is to live in Elysium ; to kiss her sweet
mouth, her eyes, her fair shoulders is Paradise for
me.”

the statutory requirements, and the use of fire-
proof materials, where possible, has reduced risk
of conflagration to the minimum. The ground-
floor is principally devoted to entrances and exits,
but it will also contain a bar, 40ft. in length,
which runs back beneatli the auditorium to a
billiard-room of equal dimensions. Here are also
situated the dressing-rooms (ten in number), fitted
with lavatories and electric-light, commodious, well-
lit, and ventilated, the “supers.” rooms and the
band’s room. Communication with the stage is
obtained by means of an iron staircase. The
stage will be 62ft. in depth by a width of 59ft., the
height from boards to gridiron 51ft., and the
depth of the stage-cellar 21ft. It will thus be
seen that the stage is more commodious than that
of any other Australian theatre and much roomier
than that of D’Oyly Carte’s new Opera House
(London.) The Lyceum stage will be fitted with
a complete set of traps, cuts and all the modern
appliances of stage mechanism. The flies are
10ft. wide, and at a height of 30ft. from the stage;
on the same level will be the paint-room, capable
of holding a double frame. On the mezzanine
floor under the stage is situated the car-
penter’s shop. The property-room is large and
conveniently situated, and the proscenium is 29ft.
wide and 28ft. high. There will be no stage-
boxes in this house, and the d.c.-boxes, two on
each side, are so constructed as to afford their
inmates a full view of the stage while not inter-
fering with the general line of vision, while the
upper-circle boxes above, twice as large, are in-
tended for the use of theatre-parties. The dress-
circle, reached by two handsome stone staircases,
will be elaborately furnished, and the promenade
at its rear communicates with a foyer which leads
to the winter garden running the full width of
the building, which in turn opens on a spacious
colonnade overlooking the street. The circle
will be provided with a crush-room and a
ladies’ room, to be fitted with every requisite
and toilet convenience. Fresh air will he
introduced into the auditorium by means
of a sliding-roof and also of pipes, which,
aided by a fan, will draw down and disseminate
pure air from altitudes above the smoke-line. The
front part of the building will be fitted up as a
hotel, five storeys high, on a scale equal to any-
thing in Sydney, and, like the theatre, it will be
fitted throughout with the electric-light. The
front will be executed in red brick after the style
of the Queen Anne period. The designs have
been prepared by Messrs. Backhouse and Laidley,
under whose supervision the work is being
rapidly carried on by Mr. Walter Ives, who has
the entire contract. Mr. William T. Muston, the
gentleman to whose enterprise Sydney owns this
magnificent structure, informs us that both
theatre and hotel are to he let for a term of years.

Tales of the Old Regime.
No. III.—Convict Arden’s Yellow-Heart
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
To Systems, as to individual men, there
comes a culminating moment, when the pinnacle
of achievement has been won, and the force of
genius can ascend no further.
This is a tale of the way the Regime attained
its omnax. When the men of the Regime had
achieved this deed they followed the example of
that artist-founder who, having turned out from
the mould a masterpiece of design, broke the
matrix. If they could help it, there should ba.no
duplication, no repetition,' of their brilliant act.
They resolved to make such another deed im-
possible. They broke their matrix. They had
created their masterpiece.
In a former story* we told you how the men of
the Regime cast dead convicts to the sharks.
This is the story of how the Regime threw a
living convict to those useful and intelligent
officers of the System as a part of their rations.
# 4 #
A bark hut on the eastern shores of Nor-
folk Bay, Tasman’s Peninsula. A gang of men
: —no, convicts —lounging “ at ease ” just outside.
Some twenty they are in number, the majority
with the ineffaceable gaol visage, and all with the
broad-arrow visible on the rags that refuse to hide
the rascals’ nudity. The month is February ; the
march of the icy blasts from the Antarctic seas
has not been impeded by the miles of thicket and
timber which.separate the Bay from the Southern
Ocean, so that at this early morning hour of a
Tasmanian summer day the transports shiver
more acutely than they would do in the middle
of an Australian winter. Two Establishment
officers, snug in blue uniform overcoats, look op
the grouped transports from a protected corner-
Ope, the superior (he wears a cap, the other’s head
being covered by a straw hat), beats his breast
with his mittened hands to promote his circula-
tion.
“D— —d if it ain’t sharp this mornin’!” he is
condescending enough to remark to his subor-
dinate. (Assistapt-Superintendent Gank can be
affable vvhen he chooses.) “It ain’t no joke
waitin’ his Rev’runce’s convenience to-day.”
“ No, sir,” replied the other (one Morgan),
touching his hat, “an’it’s the sort o’day I’d not
mind a job that wud warm me.”
“ Well, we’ll see if we can’t give yer one as soon
as the soul-saver’s gone.”
“I wish he wud go, sir. All that caterwauling
in there, an’ the mummery, ain’t it disgustin’,
sir ?” says Protestant Mr. Morgan.
“Very! Wot the devil he wants down’ere I
don’t know. If I’d thought any o’ the gang ’ad
got a pipe!* ter him w’en he was hup to the
Settlement I’d make it warm fer him.”
“ Yes, sir, I wud, sir—that I wud. Why can’t
Se pa’sbns mind their own bis’ness ?” rejoins
organ.
You see Mr. Morgan, scourger jo Norfolk Bay
timber-gang, No. 5, is devoted heart, soul and
hpdy to the System. Naturally, therefore, he is a
mere speaking-tube for the ideas and sentiments
origin ally framed by his superiors of all ranks. It
is a cardinal maxim at this date with everybody in
power under the Regime from Lieutenant-
Governor George Arthur to ’Sistant-Super Gank
that parsons and other people with ah inconvenient
habit of asking why This is So are to be welcomed
With the cold shoulder. And Father Nellathorne,
simply a missionary-priest and Vicar-General of
a nebulous diocese, and not yet Bishop of Hetalona
or Archbishop of Birmingham, being peculiarly
inquisitive and' impertinent, is particularly to be
frowned upon, treated with contumely, and
thwarted in every way possible.
■“ Yes,” went on Mr. Gank, “an’ ’im a-takip’
fiup Of Guv’munt time, too. There’s the ’hole
gang got ter lose a hour apiece ’acause of them
ghperstishus' babies wots inside. Cpnfesshun,
indeed! I’d like to’ear their confesshuns. There’s
that Duffy,'now, an’ Arden—l knows as they’re
alius hup ter mischief, they gets so of’n away by
’ernselves, an’— 1 —” ’
The door of the hut swings ajar. A cropped
head protrudes, the face belonging to it being
damp with new-fallen tears, and its lips vyhisper :
“ The Father’s compliments, sir, an’ he’ll be
obliged by you’re not talking by the wall. He
hears every word.”
’Sistant-Super. Gank is shocked into a tremulous
silence. Such a message by such a messenger!
The dignity of the System demands immediate
action. If he.fail to, assert himself, why the gang
will prove mutinous, the Peninsula will revolt,
the Penal System will tumble, and, ip its, fall,
bring to the ground the Goy’ment, the. fabric of
Law and Society—nay, the Throne itself!
‘ Through the open door, the gang “at ease”
hear the voice of the priest, the responses of the
convict (Dpffy) acting as server, and, the hard-
breathed murmur of the half-dozen worshippers
before the Great Sacrifice :
“ Misereatur vestri omnipotent Deus, et dimissis
pqccatis vestris. perd,ucat vos ad vitarn cetemam.”
“ Amen. ”
“ Indulgentiam, afjsolutionem et remissionem
pqccaforum ”
So far ; then
Assistant-Superintendent Gank recovers from
his mental contemplation of the horrors which, will
ensue should he allow Transport Arden, also offi.ciat-
ipg as father Nellathprpe’s, acolyte, to, go un-
punished, and he thrusts forth, his hand* clutches
Arden by the fragment of jacket collar protruding
from his acolyte’s surplice, and hauls him out.
“ Oh, sir ! ”
“. . . Omnipotent et misericors Dominus.”
“ Amen.”
“ Give ’im a dozen, Morgan—insultin’ ’is offiser.
I’ll teach yer ter speak ter a offiser without
cappin’.”
‘ ‘ Deus, tu conversus vivijicatis nos —”
The door bangs too. But not before the priest
—filled with anguish unspeakable because he dare
not, celebrating as he is his holy function, move a
step to interfere—hears the jeer of the master of
“N.B. 5 timber gang”—
“An’ ’nother dozen on top o’that, Morgan, my
boy, fer a-breakin’ of ’nother reg’lashun—he’s
a-wearin’ clo’s not pervided by Guv’munt.”
It is the practice of the good Father to carry oh
all his intercolonial travels, with the vessels of
the Mass and his priestly vestments, tunics for a
clerk and a second acolyte. Arden, afaiidy-educated
youth of 20, transported for Heaven knows what,
and possibly wrongfully, and enlisted in “N.B. 5
timber gang ” because he is weak and sickly and
the gang-work is heavy and cruelly-laborious, has,
on Father Nellathorne’s hurried visit to the gang
station, begged to be allowed to act as assistant.
The priest has consented —and, before he reaches
the Gloria, he hears Convict Arden’s Screams.
For Convict Arden gets his second “ dozen ” for
wearing a garment or garments not authorised by
Government. Vide His Majesty’s Regulations.
# # #
And the Rite goes on to its final benedic-
tion. And Convict Arden—staggering—writhing
—bleeding—with the salt tears of shame and pain
I’olling over the dewy mo’sture vvhiclx sptang out
at Confession to the sympathetic monitions of
Father Nellathorne—gathers up the crhrnpled
linen from the spot where the brutal hand (Pro-
testant to the finger-tips) of Scourger Morgan has
flung it like a thing accursed.
In taking it up he stains tile garment with the
impress of his bloody touch.
“ I’ve a good mind to give yer ’neither ‘ dozen ’
for a-spoilin’ the soul-saver’s proputty,” laughed
the Assistant-Superintendent. But he is merely
joking. If it were Gov’ment property, he wouldn’t
joke —he’d thrash,
Mr. Morgan, combing the eats which had been
stuck together by the juices of Convict Arden’s
body—and being much warmer —laughs at the
joke, So dp the gang “at ease.” Humour is
dreadfully contagious when the point of the joke
can be driven into the consciousness by the cracker
of the lash. That’s what John Price used to say,
and he was in a position to speak. When John
Price was officially merry, fie could always depend
on his witticisms being applauded, So could the
numerous smaller John Prices.
ON THE WRONG TRACK.
NEW CHUM: “Where about is the most gold in this colony?”
OLD HAND: “Oh, you came the wrong way—it’s in the Melbourne pawnshops.”
“Oh, Father ! He flogged me forgiving—
your message. ”
“I know it, Arden, my poor boy.” There was
a mist in the stern eyes, and a tear on the pale
face. “I know it,” How could he help knowing
it? Was not Arden’s back . . . ?
“ I shall dfe, Rather, I shall die !”
“ Not till God, wills it, my boy. Don’t lose
heart, don’t lose faith. Our Blessed Lord and His
Blessed Mother will protect you.”
“And I did not—receive, Father —after all!
Father ! And I prepared—myself so !”
“ You did, my son. But God will accept your
intention.”
“ They will —kill me, Father—when you’ve
gone. You don’t know Gank.”
Through the interstices of the sheets of bark
which did duty as a wall, both the priest and the
transport heard ’Sistant-Super. Gank acknowledge
the reference to himself, by remarking to Morgan,
in a voice in which there was no pretence of hush-
ing : “ He’s right there, he don’t know me.”
Father Nellathorne had emerged from the hut
upon the conclusion of the Mass, just in time to
see Arden fall. One of the men, by Gank's
orders, had pulled the lad to his feet, but, leaving
him for a second unsupported, Arden had again
fallen. Then the priest lifted him tenderly and
carried him inside the hut,
“Like his impidence, ain’t it ?” ejaculated
the gang-master.
“Ain’t it!” echoed the gang-scourger.
And, in both their minds, the determination
took shape that Convict Arden should suffer for
Father INellathorne’s insult to the local authori-
ties. Moved by the same impulse, the local
authorities stole to the side of the building and
listened.
* * *
“You don’t know Gank!” had Convict
Arden said.
Mr, Gank acquiesced, and when Father Nella-
thorne came out the second time and demanded
the reason he was eavesdropping he presented to
the ecclesiastic a bit of his mind.
ji“Look yer ’ere, Father Wot’s-yer-name. I’ll
report yer ter Dr. Rossell—yer just incitin’ ter
mutiny, an’ yer interferin’ with discipline, an’ yer
awastin’ Guv’munt time. Me an’ the men ’a got
ter ivait yer convenience till yer an’ yer babies a
done yet idol’trous
“Silence, sir ! Don’t think you’ve a transport
to deal with. Report to Commandant Rossellas
you please, but make your mind up to this—that
you shall be reported to the Governor •’
“Wot fer, yer Rev’tunce?” sneered Gang-master
Gank. “Fer punishin’ a pris’ner ’cordin’ ter
Reg’lashun! Report away, an’ be ter yer ! ’
Father Nellathorne realised that he had been
indiscreet in threatening the gentleman to whose
refined instincts and capacity for getting the most
out of prisoners the Regime had entrusted the 2/
men composing N.B. Timber Gang Iso. 5. He
was still new to his duties was ather Nellathorne,
and inasmuch as he had been only a year in the
new land, he had not yet learnt to accommodate
himself to the System; He crossed himself and
clenched his hands in bitter contrition for his
errdr of judgment. He understood now that the
prisoners of his faith would atone for any arraign-
ment he might make of the System’s justice.
The priest clenched his hands. Gank saw the
gesture, and, true to the poles of his nature, mis-
understood it. He was a bully, but he was hot a
coWard, and though he expected a blow—for so lie
had conceived the priest’s action —he did not
flinch. T „
“Lift yet ’and ter me, yer Rev runce, an ill
send yer in irons ter Woody Island. Yer ain’t
never performed Mass in irons, ’ave yer ? ”
“I—l had no intention of striking you,’ the
priest said.
“ Yer lie, yer Rev’runce ! ”
Convict James Duffy, late server at Mass,
placed carefully on the ground the small mahogany
case containing the sacred vessels, and moved
towards the officer. Righteous indignation illu-
minated his coarse features; and inspired his
words—and his blow.
For he struck Gank between the eyes.
With a vivid apprehension of the consequences,
he propelled his fist into the Assistant-Super, s
face, and cried :
“Yer cur ! To insult a holy praste who mayn t
hit back.” In the same movement he wheeled
round and flung himself at the Father’s feet.
“Yer blessin’, Father! An’ promise me, yer
Riverinoe, that ye’ll not go to Sydney till ye’ve
given me absolution at the last.”
The priest, sobbing, blessed the man, as Morgan
and two of the gang grasped Duffy and tore him
away to the ironing-block. Weight of irons, 351bs,
“Oh, Duffy, Duffy, I’ll save you ”
“Not if I can ’elp it,” shouted Gank. “Yer
can put it into yer pipe an’ smoke it that yer’ve
’elped ter ’ang a man with yer blarsted ’ficious-
nuss. ”
The day came when, “by the long wash of
Australasian seas,” the name of Nellathorne was
potent for good. That day was followed by
another when it moved the springs of action in
the Councils of the Vatican and the missions of
the Propaganda-and by a later day still when
it thrilled boys’ hearts in “historic Oscott” and
stirred men’s pulses in gaunt factories of Mid-
England. But it was powerless at Hobart Town in
183— to advert from James Duffy, transport, the
consequences of striking Gang-master Gank in
the face.
He was—it is, perhaps, unnecessary to state —
hanged. He made a decent and edifying ending.
Roarin Phil Conolly, jolly, kind-hearted,
but unsacerdotal Phil—would have bestowed the
lastconsolations of the Church. Nellathorne, how-
ever, assumed that sad office, and, passing straight
from Governor Arthur’s cottage to the condemned
cell, there administered the Viaticum.
As he had strode from the Governor’s verandah
—the hall-step was just where the statue of
Franklin now gazes over an expanse of sea and
land unrivalled in point of picturesqueness in all
Australasia—he turned and said to Colonel
Arthur, who, with the courtesy so characteristic
of him, had escorted him to the door :
“We may never meet again, your Excellency,
till before the throne of Him who will know
neither bond nor free, ruler nor ruled. You have
refused my appeal, and I can only pray that at
that awful hour of judgment you will not regret
your refusal. God bless you, sir.”
“It is the law—and the Regulations. To pass
unrebuked an unprovoked assault on an officer,
entrusted with the responsible care of a gang
removed from the aid of soldiery, would promote
rebellion throughout the island.”
The priest and the pro-Consul exchanged bows
and the former went his way to the gaol. As he
passed the gate, the sentry heard him mutter :
“Unrebuked! What he should have said was
unhanged!”
# # #
And Convict Arden, what of him r (
As Scourger Morgan was adorning transport
and shortly-to-be-executed Duffy with the irons
which were never to be struck off him again till
tlie Litany for a Soul Departing—his soul!—was
being recited in his ears, the ringing of the
hammer against the rivet-heads on the ironing-
block roused the exhausted consciousness of the
hoy. . .
Father Nellathorne had returned to bis side.
“1 must go, Arden. Christ and all His holy
angels be with you and guide you !”
“Oh —must you, Father? Will Mr. Gank —
let Duffy come—to —me?”
“ They’re ironing Duffy—he struck the officer —”
“Never ! My God ! ” Arden drew himself up
on one elbow; “Oh, what-shall I do, what shall
Ido ! ” The strength of despair made his accehts
clear and vigorous—and they reached the ears of
that intelligent and soon-to-be promoted officer Of
the Regime. ’Sistant-Super. Gank.
“What shall I do ! ” the lad was saying again.
“He’s —my—only friend, Father, here.”
Mr. Gank came in. “Oh, oh, none o’ that,
Arden —no complaints ’cept through orthorised
channels. No frien’s ’ere! Why, I’m ’ere, an’
Flogger Morgan, an’ we’re the best frien’s yer can
’av !” The devil was jocose.
“An’, Father Wot’s-yer-name,” he resumed,
“the boat from One Tree P’int’s a-comin’ down-
stream, an’ yer’d better be ready. I’m not a-goin’
ter wait no longer fer yer ! ’Ere’s eight o’clock
now, an’ no work done. An’ look yer, Arden, yer
a-goin’ ter Woody Island, too.”
“What !” From the priest.
“O, Mother of God ! ” From the convict.
“Never mind wot, an’ the Virgin Mary a-can’t
’elp yer. Don’t yer know as this No. 5 gang is a
good-conduo’ gang, an’ don’t yer know as No. 7
gang at One Tree P’int ain’t a good-conduc’ gang,
an’ don’t yer know as there is no sodgers ’ere an’
on’y one flogger, an’ that there’s sodgers there, an’
two floggers. An’, fin’lly, as Parson Ford says—
ah, Mr. Priest, ’im’s the Min’ster arter ray ’art
don’t yer know as yer forfeited yer place in this
’ere gang, an’ yer ’av to go now ter No. 7 gang,
with two conwictions a gen yer.”
“Two convictions. What’s the boy done?”
“ That ain’t nothink ter yer, Mr. Priest. But
where a yer eyes been ? Didn’t ’e a-come out an’
speak ter me without touchin’ ’is cap ?”
“He had no cap on —he was in chapel!” ex-
claimed Father Nellathorne.
“ Well, if ’e ’adn’t no cap on, ’e didn’t a-touch
’is ’ead, so ’e broke reg’lashun of respeo’. An’
then he was a-wearin’ of clos’ that ’adn’t been
issued by Guv’munt. That’s conwiction No. 2.
Now, Arden, yer get hup—an’ strip—the boat’s
’ere—yer a-goin’ at wunst.”
“Strip!” The priest replied for Arden. As
for the young convict, he appeared on the verge of
insensibility.
Duffy’s removal and his own transfer to the
awful No. 7 Gang, whose average of murderers
and # # * * was never less than seventp-
Jive per cent., might well have broken down the
last bulwark of intelligence in a stronger brain.
“Yes, strip! They’ve got their own uniform
at No. 7, an’ I’m short o’ clo’s as ’tis ’ere. Strip,
I say, Arden !”
With trembling fingers and silent invocations
to the Heavenly Powers—ah, what tremendous
faith was that which could still grope towards a
God amidst such scenes! —Father Nellathorne
assisted Arden to strip—rather, himself freed the
convict from his few remaining rags.
“ Raise yourself, Arden, raise yourself, my poor
boy ! I’m going with you in the boat,” he whis-
pered, but it was doubtful if the transport heard.
His eyes were open, but their look was vacant,
ghastly, fixed. And when at last he stood nude,
his arms remained—one, the right, bent at the
elbow ; the other raised level at the shoulder —in
the same position the priest had placed them in as
he had lifted the limbs to untie the pieces of
string which linked the tatters together, and
which had been knotted under the armpits.
Stark-naked t ml stark-stiff 1)6 stood.
The priest gazed at him, horrified. He recog-
nised at once that Arden was a cataleptic, and
that the terrors of his morning’s experience had
robbed him of all sense and physical capacity—
of everything, indeed, save a suspended vitality.
“Come, get alon’, Arden —’twixt yer an’ his
Rev’runce ’ere I’m losin’ an ’ole day.” And the
responsible officer, as Colonel Arthur termed him
a week later, pushed the transport forward.
Of course, the transport fell, and, of course,
there happened—
Now, reader, what would you expect to happen
if vou threw down a rigid human body on its
right arm. when its right arm was bent at the
elbow ? Just what you would expect to occur did
then and there happen.
Father Nellathorne, then Bishop, told the story
thirty years afterward while seated in the refec-
tory at Oscott College.
“I would have set the limb,” he said simply,
“ but the overseer would not give me time. ‘ No,’
he remarked, ‘ you can set it in the boat going
down if you want to. I can’t keep the men longer
—time’s precious.’”
* * *
They picked Arden up—some of Ids fellow-
gangers—and carried him, with the still frosty air
nipping his uncovered skin, and that portion of
his body where the skin was not (having been
licked up by “ the nine detested thongs ” J), to the
bay shingle and dropped him into the stern-sheets
of the whale-boat. His left arm stuck out from
his shoulder: they could not force it down; the
eyes were still fixed in their awful strain ; but the
right arm, broken in two places, dangled limply.
Father Nellathorne turned to shake Duffy’s
braceleted hands before following the cataleptic
into the six-oared craft. He faced, instead,
Scourger Morgan.
Mr. Morgan touched his straw-hat. Which was
a piece of supererogative politeness on his part,
inasmuch as the Reverend William Bernard

paysheets as an officer of the Regime. And Mr*
Morgan spoke.
“Beg pardin’, sir, but I’ve met with an ax-
sedent! ” If he uttered the truth, the.mischance
seemed to be of a pleasing nature,, as a grin added
a new horror to his facial deformity.
“ Yes, my man !” The priest was courteous;
the attraction of repulsion drew him to the
wretch; perhaps the flogger wanted his aid, and
of Protestant or Catholic, bond or free, none ever
appealed vainly to Father Nellathorne.
“Yes, my man?”
“ Please, yer Rev-runce, Mis-ter Gank told me
ter take yer box, sir, ter the boat—ter save yer
Rev-runce tr’uble, an’, sir, a ax-sedent 'appened,
sir ?’
“ What!” The voice that could respond meekly
to a personal insult, massed in volume like the
thunder among the hills when it was the Church
that was outraged. ScOurger Morgan jumped
back a yard. He would have given a year’s wage
(at two shillings and twopence per diem) to have
been elsewhere at that moment.
“ What!” stormed the voice.
“Please, sir, ’twas a ax-sedent, sir, really. I
slipped, sir, an’ dropped the box into—the bay.”
The landing-place was shelving shingle. Twenty
yards distant a forty-feet-high cliff bathed its
shadow three fathoms deep into the water. There,
Morgan—quite accidentally ! - had dropped the
box of Communion plate. Intent upon poor
Arden, the Father had neither heard the splash
nor the burst of applause from the gang and boats’-
crew which had greeted the act.
The priest, stunned at the foul outrage, knelt
on the ground, and, burying his face in his hands,
cried aloud in the humiliation of his manhood and
the shame which had visited h : s priestliness.
“ Deus, in aJjutorium rneum intended” O God,
come to my assistance !
His faith fettered every faculty, save that of the
spirit. In the few minutes which elapsed before
he stood erect again he went down into the depths,
and in his isolation from the world of sight and
sound he did not hear Assistant-Superintendent
Gank issue an order.
“ ’Way, cox’n, pa'son ain’t a cornin’, I’spose, as
he’s lost’is box. ’Ere’sthe jark§ for the body o’
that there pris’ir r. Com’dant Kossell ’ll confirm
by signal.”
And the oars fell into the rowlocks—the tiller-
lines were handled—and the boat sped on its pas-
sage to Woody Island station —the abiding-place
of No. 7 gang with its 75 per cent, of criminals of
the nameless -sort.
When the Father arose, chilled to the bone
by the grass which had refused to exhale the
moisture it had stored up during the dark, the
boat was out of sight. Only the sound of the dip
and splash of the oars was in the a r.
* * #
Look at the map of Tasmania, and in the open-
ing of the arm of the ocean known as Norfolk Bay
you will see Woody Island. Opposite to it, pro-
jecting from Forestier’s Peninsula, is One Tree
Point. The “ home ”of No. 7 gang was at Woody
Island, but the party was at the date of our story
timber-getting at the Point. The gang was indis-
criminately spoken of as the “Point,” the
“Woody,” “No. 7 gang,” or “Murderers’.”
There is a grim record extant of the occurrence of
an atrocity in the neighbourhood. One historian
says it took place at Woody Island —a second, at
“No. 7 gang station,” while a third circum-
stantially refers the locality to the One Tree. A
cursory searcher after the truth of the Van-
demonian past will conclude there were three
several atrocities, but he will be in error. We,
anxious to do the Regime and the System no in-
justice, are satisfied there was but the one atrocity.
..... —jcv.-y <u uusquared timber,
which was the Island landing-place, the boat was
driven by the pulsing oars.
The “T.L.” hutkeeper, the only man left at
“ home,” came down to meet it.
“ Overseer says you’re to take the priest - God !
—what’s that ? ” He had caught sight of Arden’s
protruding arm.
“ There ain’t no priest to-day, an’ this is a new
’un for the gang—two ’fences agen him from No. 5.
He looks bad, don’t he? ”
“ Poor devil, yes ! Is he stiff (dead) ? ”
“No-o, guess soon’ll be, though. Any’ow, 1
deliver him here. Here’s the jark ! Out with
him, lads—we’ll have to hurry to One Tree to
let Overseer know as there won’t be Mass to-day.”
And, not with excessive roughness, was Convict
Arden deposited on the jetty-planks.
Another second, and the crew were once moro
bending to their oars to carry the news to the
four or five Catholics at the Point that Heaven
had forgotten them.
* * #
The T.L.-man was old and feeble, other-
wise he would not have been hut-keeper. And
once, in the dim and distant past, in another
world, in a world from which light and love and
peace had not vanished, he had had such a son as
the lad who lay supine where the crew had
pitched him. He tried to lift the boy to carry
him to the huts, but lacked the strength. So,
touched by the home memories, and in flagrant
violation of the Regulations, which implied that
till the Overseer of “ Murderers’ ” should issue to
Convict Arden a No. 7 gang uniform—leather cap,
yellow and black trousers, and a grey jacket with
a piece of yellow cloth (heart-shaped) sewn into
its back —Convict Arden should remain nude, he
brought from a hut an old suit of clothes.
With infinite labour he managed to shroud the
nether limbs.
But the stiff, protruding arm, and the dangling
one—which he had touched and dropped, with
the exclamation, “ Broken, by God !” defied him
to cover them. And he was fain to fasten the
garment by the sleeves around the neck. Shifting
the Convict’s back, he caused to be parted from the
flesh a strip of skin two or three inches long which
had adhered to the deck-plank. The hut-keeper
shuddered as he saw it. But Convict Arden
gazed straight on, on into Eternity —and saw
nothing.
* # *
It was about half-past nine when the hut-
keeper’s humanity prompted him to violate the
King’s Regulations: At eleven, the boat returned:
A convict-constable arrived with it.
“ Overseer sez that that young ’un is ter be
given ter the sharks if he’s cheated the croaker.
Cox’n tol’ him he warn’t dead yet, an’ he sez I’m
ter see. If he is, we needn’t put ’im on our roll
’ere, he tez. He ain’t a-goiifi ter take No, s’s
stiffs.”
“1 don't know,” said the hut-keeper: “It
beats me: Look at him yerself.”
The convict constable did look, turned the cata-
leptic over, anti made up his mind quickly. He
knew nothing of catalepsy. How should he? He
had never walked the hospitals, though he had the
scaffold:
“Oh, there ain't iro doubt ’bout him —he’f? stiff.
Look at ‘is glims. Here, lads, take him ! ”
And, once again, Convict Arden was the boat’s
passenger,
# v * *
Now, there had been a ream of corres-
pondence between the Commissariat Authorities,
and Commandant and Dr. Rossell of Port Arthur,
as to tile rationing of, the sharks in Long and Nor-
folk Bays. There bad not been many suicides
for some months, and to avert the disaster —the
desertion of the intelligent sentinels —which was
thus threatened, the Commandant had been
reluctantly compelled to feed the topes, the bulls
and the hammer heads oh ration beef and pork.
Which was wasteful, said the Commissariat, who
thereupon had obtained Governor Arthur’s ap-
proval to this minute ; —■
AT REHEARSAL.
CONDUCTOR OF CONCET (at rehearsal, to a couple of ladies who are not singing): “Hi, you
younk Katies, do not come next reherzal. Send your photographs—they will be shust
as goot!"
In future an occasional transport, whose death the
Commandant is satisfied has occurred from natural
causes, is to be consigned to the waters of Long Bap,
Norfolk Bay, and those adjacent to East Bay Neck.
This was a minute, and not a proclamation.
Still, it is somewhat surprising the dopument did
not end with the formula : “God save the King!”
# # #
The oars plied their strokes till—halfway
to One Tree Point —the crew saw a group of fins.
The sentinels were on the look-out. Short-
rationed or not, they were still faithful to the
Regime. At the flash of the oars, a gigantic
white shark and a bull separated from the rest.
They followed in the boat’s wake; slowly at
first, then madly.
“Let ’em have him?” questioned the coxswain
of the constable.
“ Think so. George ! ain’t they racin’ I Which
’ud yer back, Dick ?”
“ The bully, for a fig o’ baccy 1”
“ Done! ’
* # #
“ Now?”
The constable was excited, there had been a
great race to within about twenty yards of the
boat, and his sporting instincts —and his wager—
had enlisted his utmost sympathy with the con-
testant in the lead—the white shark.
“ Now ! ”
He stooped to throw Convict Arden overboard.
In his eagerness that the animal ho had backed
should win, he overlooked the fact that Convict
Arden wore a uniform. Which should have been
taken from him before “consignment ” to the
sentinels;
Overboard, into the boat’s Wake, weht Convict
Arden. A seething of the waters —a maddening
rush of the devils of the deep, turning as they
tushed— a disappearance of the three— a redden-
ing of the waves—a sudden projection of ah arm,
a face—an awful cry-
And two of the sentinels had been rationed.
The sharks’ jaws penetrated to Convict Arden’S
consciousness and woke him from his catalepsy;
* * *
lit the “Early Forties,” one of Ben
Boyd’s whalers put into Port Stephens, and,
among other things, reported that when off Cape
Raoul she had captured .11 bull-shark, inside of
which was a broken handcuff, a boot, some
bones—and a piece of yellow cloth which
“strongly resunbled a heart in shape.”
# # *
Dio Regime, after the perpetration of this
surpassingly-excellent achievement, broke the
matrix, It rendered another such masterpiece
impossible. It made another minute——
“ No body of a dead tr(lnsport shall be consigned
to the waters Of Long Bay, Norfolk Bay and those
ddjdcent to East Bay Neck, Unless upon medical
Certificated’
You shall, dear tfeader, haVe the facsimiles of
these documents some day.
PRICE WARUNG.
§ Jark : A warrant.
Another high-toned scandal, of the hideous
“Cleveland-street ” pattern, has been unearthed
in St. Petersburg.
Edmund Yates suggests that the two
minister P. and O, steamers now a-building be
christened “St. Michael” ahd “St. George.”
Judge Murray (N.S.W.) declares that
Scotland is “the most civilised and highly cul
tured country in Europe.” Twa things we ken
aboot Scoatland : It has the highest bastardy
rate and it produces the best whusky.
Bacteria and its connection with disease is
the great modern subject of scientific research.
All the great scientists from Pasteur and Virchow
down to Koch are continually endeavouring to
discover remedies for the removal of these
blood microbes, whose presence provokes various
diseases, such as skin disease, consumption,
typhoid, diptheria, and the numerous chest and
bowel diseases. The presence of these parasites
being ascertained, the question next arises : How
are they to be got rid of ? Here William Radarn,
of Austin, Texas, steps into the breach with his
“Microbe Killer ” discovered after years of experi-
menting with herbs and chemicals. It is simply
pure water, heavily charged with powerful gases
which quickly destroy that germ pestilence which,
multiplying at the rate of seventeen millions in
twenty-four hours, poisons the blood and takes all
the sweetness from life. The Microbe Killer is
usually taken internally, at the rate of three or
four wineglasses daily, but it may be used as a
liniment, an eye-wash, injection, and a compress.
At the present time the inventor has fourteen
factories in America, England, and Germany
busily engaged in the manufacture of this medi-
cine. The head office for Australia is situated at
No. 40 Elizabeth-street, Melbourne.

A Memory.
(FOR THE BULLETIN)
A zephyr toyed with the summer Sea;
As the tired tide turned to go
I looked i» a face that was dear to mo
By the sinking sunlight’s glow i
Then my love leaped up
Like a crater’s flame,
My blood ran liquid fire,
And the hunts wete poured
From a golden cup
To the notes of a silvern lyre.
Thick sown were the stars on the sward ol night
In the furrows the moon had made ;
We sate, close-locked, in her clear, cold Sight
Ere our last love-words were said —
Each sigh was a vow
And a pledge each look,
A sacrament each kiss ;
Time ran like a brook
In the calm of night.
And our souls were steeped in bliss.
But the Clouds drove fast o’et the moon’s pale hlcb
And a gale howled o’er the sands ;
Chilled grew our lips, faint our embus •,
Cold, icy-cold, our hands :
Then mistrust sprang up;
It froze to the quick
/The blood of our late desire,
And but dregs dropped thick
From the tarnished cup ; —
No note had the silvern lyre*
In horror we parted, We fled in haste*
And the ghosts of a scarce-cold past
Rose up at our feet in the eerie waste
And sailed down the wintry blast;
Now my dead love’s Wraith
At my elbow stands,
Her eyes like coals of fire j
And with icy hands
Wtie stirs the strands
That hang from the unbent lyrC;
GEORGE BLACR.
What Invention has done.
What has invention done ? Well, this will
serve as an example merely* It used to take by
old methods, as compared with inventions now
used, iive times as much labour in bootmaking,
four times as mubh in flour-making, three times
as much in coal-mining, six times as much in
making tin cans, three times as much in carriage
making, and ten times as many looms can now be
managed by one weaver. At a silver mine in
Nevada a stream of water falling 4Coft. is made
to turn a water-wheel, and gives 200 horse-power.
'1 he same stream is carried down another 168 ft.,
ami is caught on six water-wheels, giving off 750
horse-power, which by means of electricity is con-
veyed to the surface, and runs a 60-stamp battery.
It is by the same inventions—the water-wheel and
electricity—that the great task of using Niagara
is about to be effected. Only four per cent, of
the water will be used ; it will not be noticeable,
but that quantity will supply 120,000 horse-power.
The power will not be used on the spot, but will
be conveyed by electric wires, probably to a town
sixteen miles a ■■•ay on the United States side.
In the fields of therapeutics, medicine and phar-
macology inventive genius has resulted in the
discovery of an almost infallible remedy known
as Clements Tonic. We know that this article is
capable of causing more change in affected organ-
isms than any other medicine the world has seen;
this is due to its peculiar operation on the organs
of digestion, assimilation, secretion and excretion,
for on these four processes life depends, for where
one of these important functions is improperly
performed, general impairment of the system sets
in and results in chronic disease and finally death.
It is sound wisdom to commence treatment of
cases of debility, indigestion, headaches, liver
complaints, etc., at their onset, as if neglected a
permanent change takes place in the tissues, the
disease becomes chronic and all the medical skill
in the world then ejannot restore the normal state ;
this is a fact admitted on all sides. We can
emphatically recommend Clements Tonic m all
such and many other cases, because we have seen
it in use in scores of houses and have never yet
heard a doubt as to its efficacy, we know it con-
tains the material to make its action certain, sure
and prompt, and the endorsements over the
signatures of influential citizens are conclusive, as
instanced by W. H. Goddard. Esq., manager
Commercial Bank, Newtown, N.S.W., who
writes: —“I have very much pleasure in stating
that my family and myself have derived very
great benefit by the use of Clements Tonic, which
I strongly recommend and urge any one suffering
from weakness and debility, so prevalent in this
enervating din ate, never to be without.” And
Mr. M. Gordon, Hawthorne, Vic., says :—“Per-
mit me to offer my grateful thanks for the wonder-
ful relief I have experienced by the use of Clements
Tonic. I suffered from nervousness and general
debility and indigestion for eleven years, never
knowing what it was to be free from misery and
pain. I procured Clements Tonic and the effect
was simply marvellous. Three bottles removed
all pain and suffering, my appetite came back and
I could eat a good hearty meal and enjoy it and
what was more, I could digest it afterwards with-
out that terrible tired feeling which always fol-
lowed my meals before taking Clements Tonic. I
continued the medicine and took altogether
thirteen bottles,, and honestly believe it has been
the making of a new system for me and that 1
have gained by the use of Clements Tonic a new
lease of life. I shall always praise and recommend
it, having personally proved beyond all question its
wonderful efficacy.
It has been officially announced that the
Emperor of Germany, at a recent “ Court hunt, ”
shot 312 hares in five hours. What price the
hunt ?
Parkin, the man who came hoio with a
commission to drivel about Imperial Federation,
was to have an article on “ The Working Man of
Australia” in last month’s number of the Century.

The Countess of Jersey said, at a ladies’
college opening last week, that as she was a
woman she considered herself better fitted to
speak to girls than Lord Jersey, who, whatever
he might have been, had certainly never been a
girl. The lady’s pretty platform wit quite redeems
the obvious non sequitur.
# * #
Lady Jersey’s little Jingo jingle, “One
People—One Destiny,” published in the Sydney
morning papers one day last week, presents the
leading toast of the Federation dinner in its real
light. The banquet “sentiment” was a cunningly-
framed and evasive one —it could be taken to mean
either that the peoples of Australia are one and
have one destiny, or that the “ British ” peoples—
in which are included by some of the Im-
perial Federationists the English, American and
Australasian peoples —are one and have one
destiny. Lady Jersey has no doubt whatever as
to the interpretation of the toast, and plainly
says so.
* * #
Lady Jersey (who unfortunately “ comes
from the same parish as the poet Parkes”) is
one of the few Australian vice-regal person-
ages who have ventured to publicly invoke the
Muses. Lady Broome (Lady Barker) wrote some
narratives of travel, also a cookery-book; Sir
William Robinson is believed to have on occasion
furnished the libretti of his own dirges; Sir
Charles Du Cane “dashed off” a few metrical
trifles in Tasmania; and the literary Governor
Bowen’s Australian poetic efforts were, we believe,
very privately inscribed to a raven-haired lady of
Brisbane who was subsequently the recipient of
the rapturous odes of a certain gay and festive
barrister.
# * #
Lady J ersey did not do herself the honour
of offering her poetic wares at the shrine of this
paper which would have gladly published them as
an expression of the veneration it bears the throne
and the House of Lords and a “ Queen ” who
“ Has the keys of an empire to keep
Where sets and where rises the sun” —
the same blistering old sun, by the way, which
“ sets and rises alike ” in the cow-paddock at
Jamberoo, and in the lordly dominions of the
German potentate who can go right across his
vast territories with one hop-step-and-a-jump.
# # #
The chief moral attaching to the publica-
tion of Lady Jersey’s verses is this j as with pills
so with poetry—advertising is the chief element of
success. If the noble authoress wishes to find out
the market (Heaven forbid that we should say
the true) value of her poetical works, let her
write on odd scraps of paper, append the name of
Some unadvertised governess, drop the poem into
the Herald editor’s box and await the result ere
she feeds her hungry Pegasus.
# # #
Parkes was going to work in a slab of
Lady Jersey’s pome in his speech at the Conven-
tion on Friday, but thought it rather premature,
and, consequently, reserved it for a later effort.
He will try to fire it off though before the Conven-
tion goes bung. Jersey lifted in a junk of Parkes
on the occasion of the Lang statue unveiling cere-
mony, and SVenry now has his opportunity of
squaring accounts. He’ll do it or burst.
* # #
As was Bulletin’d last w v eek, Lady Jersey
is a woman of nervous and excitable temperament-
There is a good deal of electric energy in her com-
position, and her consequent spontaneity makes,
and will continue to make, her many friends. She
permits herself to be carried away, however, and
if she does not exercise more seif-control this
tendency will get her rather laughed at. When
Parkes had concluded his Chinese bogey speech at
the Convention on Friday, Lady J. set out as
though about to embrace him, but eventually
managed to smile and speak her congratulations
without doing so, and the dignity of Government
House was preserved.
# * *
Lady Jersey has had prepared a nicely-
bound book which is intended to be filled with
the autographs of the delegates to the Federal
Convention, and also with any nice things which
the delegates may feel inspired to write therein.
The book—as well as its owner—was very much
in evidence at the Convention last week. Opposite
the page set apart for each colony is a little bit of
poetry from Lady Jersey’s own fair hand. John
Forrest, of W. A., was observed to be gulping down
the section having reference to the little-big part
of Australia which he at present “ runs,” and he
was subsequently heard to remark something to
the effect that he hadn’t previously fully realised
either West Australia’s magnificence, or that Lady
Jersey was a woman of so much knowledge and
talent.
* * #
It is denied in an inspired daily news-
paper paragraph that the now celebrated M‘Mi 11 an
divorce-suit was heard in camera. The case, it is
alleged, came before the Court in the ordinary
way (at breakfast-time?), the only difference being
that it was kept out of the cause-list. This
explanation only makes matters a thousand times
worse. The Judge certainly has legal power to
hear a case in camera if he thinks fit, but there is
nothing in the Divorce Act about keeping a case
out of the cause-list, and thus hoodwinking the
public. The Bulletin doesn’t charge the Judge
with having ordered it out of the cause-list. But
who did order it out ?
* * *
Treasurer M‘Millan appears to be quite
frisky over his rule nisi. At the N.S.W. Govern-
ment picnic to the Federation delegates he said
that “he was not quite certain that some of his
most intimate friends wei’e not the wives of
Opposition gentlemen, and all he could say was
this—that if the husbands would allow him that
social intimacy of intercourse for a few months
to come he believed the ladies would so imbibe the
liberal sentiments of the present Government that
they would say, ‘ln future we will have no
Opposition.’ ” What a funny idea it was to ask a
half-divorced man to propose “ The Ladies !”
* * *
Lord Hopetoun told the bucolics of West
Bourke that his sisters, -who had been prodding
the cattle show with their parasols in true profes-
sional style, know more about horses and stock
than he does. It’s our opinion that those two
brisk young ladies know more than their brother
about every blessed thing under the sun. They
were looking at Carbine, the other day, as though
they wanted to read his soul.
* # #
Spagnoletfci : We like Hopetoun better

West Bourke Agricultural Show t’other afternoon
“REAL THUNDER AND LIGHTNING.”
WIFE (11 p.m.) : “Where on earth have you been?”
HUSBAND: “Sh-sh-shyclorama, deah.”
and says he: “My sisters can put up a load
hay, break in a colt, or make butter with the best
of you.” Fine, red-armed and rose-elbowed gals,
going to the races in bed-gowns, just to show
their contempt for furbelows and foulards, gui-
pure, passementerie, and so on. If they’re allowed
to go out of the country, why, we are idiots.
A mild agitation for reduction of Jemmy
Mirams’ sentence has resulted in somebody dis-
covering that it may be taken to include the time
when he was out on hail. Over and above that
unique concession the little man is to get out six
weeks before his time is up. And there the
matter had better rest. The Premier Building
Association cases smell to Heaven, and although
Mirams has had bad luck, as compared with some
other people, that is no reason why a gross' mis-
carriage of justice should miscarry a little further.
* * *
A correspondent writes to The Bulletin
from Sale stating that Mr. James Mirams, of
Premier Permanent celebrity, who is ostensibly
serving 12 months in the local gaol, is having a
good time. He is permitted, avers our corres-
pondent, to abjure hominy and have his meals
brought from outside, and he takes his walks
abroad on Sale Common, sometimes in company
with a gaol official and sometimes alone—“ of
course wearing private clothes, and, above all, a
belltopper.” We print this to please our old friend
Mr. Benjamin Trovato.

How did the bold Myles M‘Rae get hold
of Miss lima Vaughan’s alleged diary, and of the
etters she wrote to her mother ? And what a lucky
man Myles was to get them !
Mr. Justice Innes, when the N.S.W.
Junior Bar crowed with laughter during “Jack ”
Want’s lovely cross-examination of Miss lima
Vaughan, sarcastically referred to them as “the
unemployed.” The Junior Bar retort, under their
breath, that the Judge’s Bar status was not such
as now to make him the personage from whom
such little jibes can most fittingly proceed. The
Judge was never, even in his palmiest days, a
Pilcher or a Jack Want.

The week’s cable news includes a unique
sort of event, a husband kidnapping his own wife.
A Mr. Jackson, with two friends, snavelled his
Mrs. Jackson as she was coming out of church,
and bundled her home, from which she had been
a wanderer with Ma-in-law, refusing conjugal
rights. Next her friends besiege the house and
finally Mr. and Mrs. Jackson become reconciled.
This latter phase is likely enough. The Sabine
women became excellent friends of their Roman
abductors, and, after all, no woman really respects
—we are quite aware this is a brutal sentiment —
a man who, well, we won’t say doesn’t knock
her about physically or mentally, but will sub-
stitute in deference to Mrs. Grundy, “ give her a
lot of trouble. ” To make a woman love you, you
must fight with her, if she will not yield you her
affections in return for having fought for her or
about her. By the way, in earlier cables it was
said that the Jacksons were Australians.
Adelaide takes the palm for lawyers.
Nearly every citizen of the Holy City who is not
a parson or in gaol preaches the law. As there
are very few clients, most Adelaide lawyers live
by defending each other and preaching on Sunday.
# # *
Much jealousy obtains amongst the
Adelaide clergy over the conduct of one of the
craft who persists in performing marriage and
burial-services at reduced rates in order to secure
the trade. The other pulpit-thumpers seriously
meditate a Trades Union.

Dear Bulletin, —Justice A’Beckett, of
Victoria, has given an interpretation of the
phrase, “habitual drunkard” in the Victorian
Divorce Act. He says that a man who occasion-
ally gets drunk and loses his billet and thus
becomes unable to support a wife, is not an
“habitual drunkard”; neither is one who tries
his best to work, but periodically “breaks out.”
The fellow whom A’Beckett is spotting is the man
who “ habitually leaves his wife without means of
support. ” If this be so, there are many teetotal
scoundrels who are Divorce-Law “ habitual
drunkards.” And if it be so, his Honor would
never class a dipsomaniaeal millionaire as an
“habitual drunkard,” provided he allowed his
wife £1 a week alimony. Judge A’Beckett tries
to limit the legal definition of the phrase to a man
who is cataleptically dVunk all the time, and
perennially stone-broke. I fear lam not eligible.
—Yours, The Dipsomaniac.

' The waiters and waitresses who have been
attending at recent Sydney church-assembly din-
ners tell grotesque stories about the appetites of
the holy men whose plates they have been passing.
As no alcohol is permitted at these sanctified
shivoos, it is plain that teetotalism, as exemplified
by its stipendiary exponents, is'often only another
name for a more than Rosnatian gluttony.

How pious some people are when boxed in
a really tight place ! A rich story is told about
one of a quartette of Sydney boating-men who got

anchor on a lee shore where the tremendous strain
of incoming seas threatened to carry away the
anchor-line and commit them to the merciless

MELBOURNE GAOL.
Was I mad ?
I don’t know ;
Shall be glad,
Glad to go.
One thing’s plain,
By the bye,
Must get sane
When you die.
Ne’er a grudge
Do I bear
To the judge,
He was fair ;
He had but
Facts to quote—
Said I cut
Stella’s throat.
Jury thought
I was sane.
So they ought—
How my brain
Seems to whirl
Round my head !
See the girl
When I’m dead.
No more hope,
Not a speck—
Put the rope
Round my neck,
I have got
Now to swing,
Mad or not —
That’s the thing !
Makes me sick
This delay.
Hang me quick !
Here, I’ll pray—
God above,
When a lad
Kills his love,
Is he mad ?
I’m content
Now to wait;
Can’t repent,
Far too late.
P’raps its hell
Where one goes—
Who can tell ?
Heaven knows.
“COME-BY-CHANCE.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
As I pondered rather weary
O’er a volume very dreary—
. I’or the plot was void of int’rest—’twas the Postal-
Guide, in fact,
There I learnt the true location,
Distance, size, and population
Of each township, town and village in the radius
of the Act.
And I learnt that Puckawidgeo
Stands beyond the Murrumbidgee,
And that Booleroi and Bumble get their let ters
twice a year,
Also, that if men were silly
They could wire to Adjinbilly
(Lord forbid that I should want to), or could write
to Dugaleur.
But my gloomy mood forsook me
When I caught a name that took me,
And the name alone was stated —“ Come-by-
Clianco ” was what I read—
No location was assigned it,
Not a tiling to help you find it,
Just an N (which stood for Northward) —and the
rest was all unsaid.
I shall leave my home and forth ward
Wander stoutly to the Northward
Till I come by chance across it, and I’ll straight-
way settle down —
For there can’t be any flurry
Nor the slightest cause for worry
Where the telegraph.don’t reach you, nor the rail-
way run to town.
And one’s letters and exchanges
Come by chance across the ranges
Where a wiry young Australian leads a packhorse
once a week.
And the good news grows by keeping,
And you’re saved the pain of weeping
Over bad news when the mailman drops the letters
in the creek.
But I think—and more’s the pity—
That there’s really no such city,
For there’s not a man can find it of the shrewdest
folks I know.
Come-by-Chance ! Be sure it never
Means a land of fierce endeavour,
It is just the careless country where the
only go.
When the mem’ries old entrancing
Days of sport and nights of dancing,
M onlight rides and stolen kisses, rippling laugh
and loving glance
When you think of these be certain
You have looked behind the curtain—
You have had the luck to linger just awhile ih

b.eAers. Their only plan of earthly salvation
was, in the interval of back-sucked seas, to haul
the line up to its shortest hold, and then break
the force of the inrolling waves by easing back to
the longest tether. Spell and spell about for 14
hours, with ’tween-shifts of bailing-out, so fully
occupied their minds that they forgot even to eat
or drink. Suddenly one of them remembered and
suggested the rum. But the Man from Balmain,
whose previous record had been a bottle per
diem, and the best part of another as his nightcap,
hysterically remarked—“ No rum for me. If my
poor body has (sob) to lie stiff and stark on that

is hereditary, judging from
the name of one of the co-respondents in a recent

however, one grain of consolation : the young man
is an undisguised libertine, who doesn’t “sham
pious;” while the old man was a hypocritical
rascal who spent his mornings with the church
synod and his evenings with the women of the
town. Everybody knew it, and everybody knew

Mr. Keightley, P.M., of N.S.W., now
dead, and who when alive was best known through
the fact that his wife rode ever so many miles
one night to get 500 sovs. from her father to
ransom her loving husband from bushrangers,
used to relate how death overtook two dishonest
kangaroo dogs of his. He was in the bush hard
up for rations —had only a couple of pounds of
flour left, and with this he made a damper which
he deposited in his tent ere proceeding to an
adjacent lagoon for water. On his return he per-
ceived that the dogs had stolen the damper, at
which they were both pulling vigorously. The
flour was bad, or Keightley was a bad baker, any-
how the damper stretched and stretched until on
its arrival at the limit of its elasticity it suddenly
parted and threw the contending dogs to the
ground with such violence that it dashed out their
brains.
A man bolts, and the detectives are after
him. Has he a wife, or is he mixed up with a
woman ? Then he will write to her, and the “ D’s ”
find out through the post-office the post-marks on
any letters received by her. When the criminal
“slews” the post-office he “slews” the detec-
tives. This system is the basis of at least half the
“ clever ” captures we read so much about. A large
number of the balance are made through the
agency of women of ill-fame, in whose residences
many of the detective-force practically camp, and
who are ready to give away even their own
“ bullies ” in favour of the plain-clothes “foorce.”
A small percentage of the members of the
detective-force visit these dens as a bona fide
matter of duty only ; the rest are dissolute vaga-
bonds with debauchery stamped upon every
feature of their evil countenances, who levy black-
mail upon the women. It is idle nonsense to talk
about “putting down” houses of ill-tame; once
you do this, you “put down ” the detective-force.
But, perhaps, both evidences of our civilisation
might well be dispensed with.

The ladies had. things a good deal their

A Melbourne paper fell into an absurd trap
last week, by republishing a fictitious letter, pur-
porting to have been written by W. G. Grace, from
Australia, in 1873. It was invented by the rather
celebrated Dick Egan Lee, jun., who hoaxingly
made out that Grace abused Australia and Aus-
tralians in the most shocking terms. Lee was the
thinnest man ever seen alive—the Living Skeleton
not excepted. The Bulletin once narrated how
he sold the Bendigo Independent, by reporting
a Loyalist meeting as abounding in Republican
sentiment, and also ho v his leader in the Cowtown
Observer got the proprietor such a welting—the
masterly leader which began, “When a female
baboon squats in a gutter and slings mud at
respectable journalists, it is time to protest.”
Dick was once in charge of a N.Z. provincial
paper during the absence of its proprietor, and
wrote at the end of an execution-report: “The
hangman then took his bloody money and de-
parted.” When the newspaper-boss, a Presby-
terian elder, returned, there was a sudden vacancy
in poor Richard’s billet. Richard Egan Lee,
sen., will be remembered as having started many
years ago the first Sunday paper printed in Mel-
bourne, which came to a disastrous end through
printing an “ objectionable ” engraving. Ho was
associated with the celebrated William Hone in
the preparation of “The Table Book,” “The
Year Book,” and read the proofs of the famous
parodies which brought Hone into trouble.

the baggage being lost, lie will begin to under-
stand the subject a little better. And when his
camel turns round with a slow, meditative air,
and first spits at him, and then slobbers him
violently, and finally bites him, he will be further
enlightened. Also, there are a good many other
causes that are likely to present themselves to his
naked eye as he goes along.

Every parson has his stock lecture on
courtship and marriage—something to liven-up
the fee market, when it is getting flat. But a
Melbourne Wesleyan one has been expounding
that £3OO a year is almost too little to get married
on, while another thinks you can do it at £l50 —
even allowing a margin of £4O a year for a
servant! In other words, poor Benedick must
keep two wives instead of one—and then there’s
mother-in-law, for a third.

grief. He sent in a bill for damages, and the

The practice of calling a common individual
“Mr.” is supposed to arouse revolutionary
tendencies in his soul and make him disrespectful
to the midshipmite on the quarter-deck, and
therefore it has to be sternly discouraged. If, by
any chance, he were described as “ Esq.” he would
probably be hanged.

There are some things besides mad dogs
and loose boiling water that are not worth steal-
ing. The other day two reduced noblemen
burgled a Melbourne warehouse and carried off
several dozen bottles of scent. They left no clue
behind them, and didn’t think it worth while
taking precautions, but their plunder gave them
away. The very next day they wei’e walking
down Bourke-street when a man who was passing
by gave a loud, enquiring sniff and began to look
round as if trying to locate the odour. Then he
seized them, one in each hand, smelt them both,
thoughtfully at first and then with an air of con-
viction, and ran them in, and when they were
violently shaken at the office the missing goods fell
out of them.

To retain his stolen place.

In the hearts of us who feed ’em

Thoroughly Established.
Some six or eight years ago the theory was
publicly announced, as based on scientific in-
vestigation and practical experimenting, that
many of the so-called diseases were only symptoms,
locally developed, of disease of the principal
functionary organs of the system—-the kidneys.
It has long been known that these organs are the
great purifiers of the system—every drop of blood
courses through them, as through the heart. If
they are healthy they properly perform their
natural functions—eliminate the waste of the
system. If they be deranged, a poison known as
uric acid, resulting from tile stagnant impurities,
accumulates. This poison naturally finds its way
through the blood channels, its only outlet if the
kidneys do not carry it off * and attacks any weak
points it finds in its path. In this way there is
developed a local disease, which is givetl a name
that describes its local character. It is, in fact,
but a system of kidney disease. The intensity of
devotion to business in this country, the push and
grind, unknown to European countries, induces a
tendency to kidney disorder. It is an insidious
foe, for the accumulation of the uric acid fre-
quently does not reveal itself until it attacks some
vital point; hence men die so suddenly with
rheumatism, apoplexy, acute Bright’s disease,
pneumonia, &c., &c. The system has become so
weakened by the insidious undermining of the
uoison coursing through the channels—of life—the
blood is the life—that it is bereft of vitality to
throw off the local disease developed at any given
point. It was claimed when these theories were
advanced that a specific for kidney derangement
was the most effective remedy for the most
< ommun and fatal ailments of our modern life.
f i he fountain is purified, the stream will be pure.
To purify and strengthen the organic source is
what the proprietors of Warner’s safe cure claim
to do, and that their theory is correct seems to
have been pretty effectually and pract cally
demonstrated. There are few hamlets in the
United States or Canada where it has not been,
and is still used, and the same remark applies to
every small and large town and village in the
Australian colonics and New Zealand, It is no
longer necessary for the proprietors to make any
claims in regard to this extended investigation into
its merits. The point has been reached where the
investigators take this duty upon themselves, the
hundreds of thousands of voluntary testimonials
afford ample evidence of the now thoroughly
established fact that most diseases, so-called, are
merely symptoms of kidney derangement, and
that by restoring the kidneys to a healthy con-
dition by Warner’s safe cure, general health is
assured. The following may be taken as an
example :—Received from W. T. Bennett, late
Brevet Brigadier General, U.S. Army, Fre-
mantle, West Australia, December 18, 1890.
When serving as an officer in the American War,
nearly 30 years ago, the hardships and vicissitudes
of the campaign produced chronic disease of the
kidneys and liver. I have since been a martyr to
attacks of gravel and swelling of the loins, due to
the presence of urates, indicating the diseased con-
dition of the kidneys. In course of time I had
dreadful pains in the left side, and any unusual
exertion aggravated them considerably. My
appetite failed, and the pains caused extreme
nervous irritability. Such was my condition
when I had to recourse to Warner’s safe cure.
By the use of 10 bottles my sufferings were grad-
ually but effectually removed.

EVERY HOUSEHOLD— especially where
there are young cnildren—should he provided
•with Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral, the prompt use ol
which has saved innumerable lives. Its effect
is immediate and certain. It stops coughing, pro-
motes expectoration, and soothes the irritated
membrane. The most famous and successful
Cough-Cure
in the world, it has no equal as a remedy for
asthma, bronchitis, inflamed tonsils, loss of
voice, whooping-cough, croup, and the sudden
pulmonary complaints to which children are
liable. Taken in the early stages of consump-
tion, it often cures that disease and always
checks its progress; and even at a later period
in the malady, it relieves the distressing cough
and induces needful repose. A safe, palatable,
and economical medicine, Ayer’s Cherry Pecto-
ral should be always at hand in case of an un.
foreseen and sudden emergency.

CORRESPONDENCE
“ Verdant Verisimple ” : Mark Twain
decidedly the greater writer. That he is the greater
humourist we would not care to assert, hut his satire is
certainly ahead of Adeler’s.... “T. J. Beckett”; Letter
posted “A Constant Reader”: Fair criticism. Why
don’t, you abuse the artist ?.... “Oanicense ” : It would bo
very pretty, indeed, had we never read “ Leichhardt.
Cast Kendall behind you. Just count how many times
you repeat the word “gracious” “J.H.C.”: V®
have received at least, 30 full parodies on Lady Jersey s
poem, and not one of them is metrically as correct as is the
lame original “Appreciation ”: Thanks “Fair
Play ” : Next week if good enough,... “A. Cross ’: Thei e
are no “ Dissenters ” in Australia. How can there be
when we have no State-church ?....“ H.A.S.” : M ill con-
sider for next week... “A. Russell ”: The N.S. W. Minister
of Justice is understood to say that the affidavits arc
worthless, as tiie persons making them are “ not
respectable ; ” yet these are the very persons upon whose
evidence the prisoner was convicted. There is a big
mystery underlying Myers’ case...“ Ben B.” : Execrable..
“Naracan”: We don’t see his name in any of the pub-
lished lists, but we have repeatedly 7 heard that he holds
N.S.W. coal interests . . .“J.J.M.”; If a telegraph-
operator is kept hard at the instrument —as in the
head-office ot an Australian capital—five hours a day is
quite enough work for him, in our opinion. The man
who can stand seven hours’ fast writing, or receiving uy
sound, must be made of wrought steel. . “Golden
Dream ”: A wild phantasm of theineless bosh. Try
again.... “ H.N.Q.” (N.Z.) and “W.A.” (Paddington);
Will consider....“ Michaelis”: If Mr. Frank Smith,
M.L;A., never received a cent for himself in re Oakey
Park Railway Bill, and if all that he did get went to pay
an expert to report on tire business for the satisfaction of
the N.S.W. Legislative Assembly, Mr. Smith is “ right as
the bank ” All he has to do now is to produce the
expert, the report, and the receipt for the money....
“ E.J.” (W.); If there is anything in the world which is
quite sure not to go into this paper it is the thing which
in the opinion ot its author “ hits the tone of Tub
Bulletin to a T.”... “Walter 11.” (Camp. ): For our-
selves, we rather like The Bulletin, even though we do
wish the population of Australia were big enough lo let us
spend £lOOO a week more in producing it. As it stands it
is a nice little paper in whose office no one lias a private
grindstone... “Jason”: The Bulletin’s t,en-year-old
commonplaces are the shibboleths of the Convention. I
When Griffith said lie was tired of being called a
“ colonist ” he repeated what The Bulletin uttered years
ago “0.A.”: As the seventeen lawyers attending the
Federal Convention aren’t paid for their sen ices it
wasn’t likely that they would waste much time....
“Drover”: “Bstsy Schyphir” won’t do. Her story is
all well enough for the boys in camp, but the general
public wouldn’t stand it. We don’t know to what you
refer ro “M. Mack.”... “H. O’D.” (W. Street, St. K.):
We haven’t heard from you again. “ Robert H.G.S.” :
You don’t tell us the title ...“Charles Raynhnm” (Mel-
bourne): Yes, we perused the audited acco mts of the
Melbourne Finance and Control Commit tee of the Mari-
timeStvike ;also the accompanying report of the auditors,
who fully explain the irregularities (through absences of
traders in Sydney) that led to the sum of £7O odd being
unaccounted for. The items of indiscriminate relief,
totalling £034 7s. (Id., could scarce!a’ he individually
avouched, as they represented thousands of half-crowns
and larger and lesser sums given away (somewhat
imprudently and very indiscriminately, it must he con-
fessed) to unemployed who might otherwise have been
tempted to join the oiackiegs, and who included bona fu'e
unemployed and loafers “ fairly on the job.” The Com-
mittee were soon compelled to “shut, down” on this
game. The items—Refund from bazaar, £4O 2s. 4)d. ;
refund charter acount, £5OO ; cheques (dishonoured)
£505 25,” are mere cross cut vies necessary for the bewil-
dering accuracy of a balance-sheet, and appear both ns
“income’’and expenditure.” The disbonou ed cheques
were actual donations received iu cheques that were not
paid by the banks . . “T.H.” (Geelong): Thanks
“Argonaut” (Mount Albion): Next wei k, perhaps.,.,
“Culcx’ : Will print-the gist of it, anyhow “T.R.”
(Perth); Yes, they are all here.. .“ R.O D.” : Thanks...
“ Peter Block ” : It never struck us before, but it strikes
us now. But it would never do to say so ... ” J..1.D.” ;
Will look into the matter ...” Montague S.” : Good. Is
it quite original ?....“ A.M.”: Wo are told that the
amount received by Captain Fisher, S.M., as a reward for
his services in connection with the late Sydney special
constable badness was £125 and not £250 as previously
stated....” W. 11. Maude ” : An old hoax : see elsewhere.
“C.L.D.”; Too long; couldn’t afford space to such a
subject “ Spotted Boy ”: Yes, “ Tales of the System ”
are to be published in hook-form; a selection from our
1-ading columns may possibly follow. Certainly other
volumes of prose and verse. [Many letters held over.J

THE LONDON POSTMEN.
There is no class of men on winch the business
public are more dependent than on the London
postmen. They are entrusted with communica-
tions of the highest importance, which rarely, if
ever, they fa Ito deliver promptl and on time.
These men as a class, are sober, it dustrious, hard-
worked servants, From early morning until late
at night, in all weathers, they continue to tramp
over and over the same route. They become a
part and parcel of the business man’s existence.
This constant walking and exposure in our change-
able climate often entails rheumatic difficulties,
pains and stiffness in the limbs ; yet there can be
no cessation from the daily routine of their lives.
Whet'er suift ring nr not, they are obliged to be
at their post, it is said that a greater proportion
of the Lo don postmen always keep that famous
remedy, St. Jacobs Oil, by tin in, •. pplying it to
the muscles after a sev< re day’s work as a pre-
ventive. Other• who had received sprai s, and
have be n affl cted with severe rheumatic pains,
have been promptly cured by the application of
this remedy. They not only me it upon ti ein-
selves and families, but recommend it to other's.
Mrs. J. Brooker, 47, 1 Tine -s-road, Kenni gt
Cross, \i' nd n, S.F., the wi f-* of a postmaffi
writes ; “ I have suffered most agonising rheumatic
pains through my shoulders and the back of my
neck for some inontt s past, many times being
unable to obtain any sleep at night, which wd oily
unfitted me for my household .duties in the day-
time. My husband having heard his fellow post-
men speak very highly ot St. Jacobs Oil for
‘ prains and soreness in the limbs, as well as for
euralgia and rheumatism, procured a bottle from
the company’s office, at 45, Farringdon-ioad, the
contents o which he applied to the afflicted parts,
and, to our great surpr se and joy, the pain
chparted almost at o ce, affording me the first
eood night’s sleep I had been able to obla n for
many a night. 1 consider St. Jacobs Oil an n-
valuable preparation for pain, and shall always
keep a bottle of it on hand.” Mr. A. F. 0 inn, of
31, Swinton-street, Gray’s Inn-ioad, London,
W.C., writes : “ One morning on my rounds, as
postman, 1 sprained my ankle, and was scarcely
able to walk, when I was recommended to use St.
Jacobs Oil- I- procured a bottle, and before 1 had
used one-half the contents 1 was perfectly cured.”
Mr. 11. Newman, 45, F.cton-stieet, Camberwell,
London, S. E.< postman, says: “Have suffered
from rheumatism in the knees for a period of
twelve months, during which time I consulted
several physicians, and tried many remedies, with-
out receiving any benefit. Being advised to use
St. Jacobs Oil, I have much pleasure in saying
that it eased the pain directly. I felt it aon like
an electric battery on me. The contents of one-
bottle completely cured me, and I can now walk
as well as ever. I have no hesitation in recom-
mending St. Jacobs 0.1 to all suffering from
rheumatism as being a ‘Conqueror of Fain.’'’
While the postman’s “lot at best is not a happy
one,” he is undoubtedly saved much pain and dis-
comfort, which he w. uld otherwise be obliged to
endure were it not for the remedy in question.—

PRACTICAL PHILANTHROPISTS.
THE blessings of peace ami industry are found
iu the advance of civilisation and the de-
velopment of resources—whether the latter be of
mental or mechanical evolution. They who add
to the conveniences of living, to the education of
the masses, accomplish something’ more than a
mere striving for riches —a fact wh ch cnnnot be
gainsaid. Therefore, the development of an im-
proved farming utensil is a benefaction to the
community at largo as well as a source of profit to
its originator. In connection with this we may
asssume that any manufacture, of an article
which tends to elevate the condition of the masses
bears the stamp of genuine merit, and deserves
attention .other than that of mere commercial
interest. Accepting such reasoning for a basis of
fact, we believe none can gainsay the claim of the
Wat rbury: Watch Company to be considered
practical philantbr pists, inasmuch as by the pro-
duction of an accurate, reliable and time-keeping
watch, at a price within the means of every indus-
trious person, they have already educated large
masses of people to a realising sense of the value
f time, and besides are daily and hourly teaching
vonths and adults of both sexes the necessity of
punctuality, and the assurance of possible and
probable success in the future, when they shall
heed the passing moments, and utilise them in
accordance with the warning hands of their faith-
ful watches.

The New York Life Insurance Company
Pays Its Policy.
It being evident that most cases of self-destruc-
tion involve causes not under the victim’s own
control, and that accident and murder may easily
give rise to a suspicion of voluntary death, the
New York Life Insurance Company, in order to
prevent wrongs to the unfortunate, makes its
policies absolute security. It exercises caution in
granting a policy, and never issues one unless its
officers consider the applicant a good risk. But
when it has once issued its policy and taken the
premium, it feels bound to insure. It does not
insert in its policies the usual clause making them
void in case of “self-destruction, voluntarily or
involuntarily, sane or insane,” and claims no re-
lease from its contract except where there is
evidence of a purpose to defraud. In short, so
far as a life policy may properly be such, the New
York Life’s policies are incontestable from the
moment the first premium is paid. The man with a
New York Life Insurance policy may feelsure that,
incase of his death, no delay, litigation or loss will
arise from the question of self-destruction—
whether it be accidental or otherwise. If he has
been honestly insured, and honestly conforms to
the simple requirements of the contract, the pay-
ment of his policy is sure on proof of his death.

The Gordon-Cumniing mode of cheating,

circumstantial account, asserts that he used to
increase or decrease his stake, according to cir-
cumstances after the game was made, by pushing
on or withdrawing money. Poor, mean and feeble
this.
Here are the facts of an occurrence often

home along the Haymarket. A woman accosted
him, and while they were talking a man named
W ilson came up, threatening to expose Mr. Glad-
stone in the Morning Herald unless money were
given him or a billet procured at Somerset House.

Sir George Chetwynd’s two volumes of
“Turf Recollections,” just out, are not badly put

Frail, a well-known turfite, was a friend cf
Palmer, the poisoner, and they slept in a double-
bedded room, when Frail had gone to the pro-
vinces as an election agent. In the morning
Palmer said blandly : “ What was that you took
from under your pillow?” “Only £3OOO in
notes,” replied Frail - Swindells was a well-known
bool anaker, and another metallician asked h m for
advice, because a backer had paid him £lOO twice
over. “Look him square in the face,” said
Swindells, “ and maybe ho will pay you again ”
A friend asked another : “ Is he afraid of dying?”
“No,” was the reply, “not exactly,but he.isafraid
he won’t be asked into the drawing-room.”

The Future of New South Wales.
MIXED FARMINGS.
The last few years have seen a wonderful change
in the utilisation of the soil so far as our fair
colony is concerned. For the past half century
almost, it has been the custom throughout Aus-
tralasia to regard N.S.W. as something in the
way of a huge sheep-run, which—chough yielding
excellent results to the lucky squatters who in the
early days have secured immense areas of its fertile
hills and valleys for a mere song—has sustained
but a comparatively small population where
thousands should have been located. A glance at
the many volumes which are devoted to the supply
of information as to the various runs in the colony,
and the quantity of sheep held, will almost make
the thoughtful pause and tremble to think that
such a terrible waste of nature’s goodness has
been made for the benefit of a few unappreciative
persons instead of permitting those to step in
who would seize the opportunity if it were offered
of securing a small portion of these vast estates for
the purpose of cultivation. No one possessing any
comrnonsense would, of course, say that whatshould
be done with this land is to throw it open entirely
for agricultural or fruit-growing purposes. No;
neither we nor the public are born asses, and
would never dream of enunciating such a scheme.
Great tracts of country are quite unsuited for any
purpose other than grazing, so far as we know at
present, and much of this could not be worked at
a profit except in large blocks. But there remains
a residuum which, could it but be secured by the
public, would, with methodical working, yield,
under a system of mixed farming, wonderful
results on small areas which now carry but a
few sheep. Unfortunately, the early settlers —
with an acumen, however, which did them
credit —sought out nearly all the choice spots on
the banks of the rivers, and settled there, to
build up large estates for their children in years
to come. Having secured a good footing, and
established a homestead, they set about buying
out the small selectors | around them, who
in many oases had commenced to culti-
vate the soil, and as time went on the
small farmer disappeared himself, to go fur-
ther back perhaps, and launch out as a squatter —
his place being filled by goodly flocks of sheep.
Instances whore this sort of thing occurred are to
be found in all the most fruitful localities, and
perhaps the best example to be met with is in the
favoured Hunter Hi ver district, wherein possibly
the best land of the colony is to be seen. Notably
may be mentioned the famous Ravens worth
Estate, which has recently fallen into the hands
of the Land Company of Australasia. Ravens-
worth was originally, in the days gone by, but a
comparatively small station, situated in the midst
of a thriving farming district. Gradually, how-
ever, the neighbouring farmers were bought out,
one by one, till eventually the whole estate was
acquired. Even now are to be seen the remnants
of former homesteads spread over the country,
showing where the little farms were situated,
which have since become j )ar t of immense
sheep-walks. By inverse ratio, as it were,
the Land Company are now devoting their
attention to the undoing of what the former
owners of property were at such great pains to
effect—viz., the splitting up of the estates into
such areas as will enable the small farmer to make
a decent living for himself and family. In this
respect the Company certainly deserves well of
the small selector. It would be impossible for
ordinary individuals to secure this land, but for
the fact that some great corporation with suffi-
cient capital could first acquire it from the original
holders, and in this the Company virtually under-
take a state duty. The directors, with perhaps as
much an eye to their own advantage as that of the
small selectors, have at any rate purchased this
valuable property which is almost contiguous to
tho Segenhoe Estate, and they are now offering
these properties to the public in such areas and on
such terms that they may be easily acquired and
will enable the purchaser to make a comfortable
home thereon. The land comprises all classes.
That on the hills is in every way suited
for sheep-farming, and when it is well fenced
and sub-divided into paddocks it will carry
a very large number of sheep, and on the
flats, which generally consist of a beautiful,
rich, loamy soil, aluost anything will grow, and
here, if anywhere in N.S.W., the system of mixed
farming should be successfully practised. It is
almost impossible to suggest all that can be done
upon 100 or 200 acres of this land by the small
farmer who knows something about his business.
Dairying may be carried out on an extensive
scale, and to permit of this being done success-
fully, the Company themselves will provide
the necessary cows, of which they have a great
number of the finest milking breeds, on good
terms. Steps also will be taken to open dairy
factories on the estates, on co-operative
principles. Should the small selector desire to
go in for fattening, he can always obtain also a
good supply of stores from the Company, and
will find a payable and ready market at all times
at the Australian Chilling and Freezing Com-
pany’s works, at Aberdeen. This Company have
purchased a block of country, and are now about
to erect freezing works on" the estate. Then,
if he desires to take up root or cereal
growing, the land is ready to his hand,
while, as formerly pointed out in these
columns, fruit and vine culture may be made to
pay handsomely on a large area of the Comnany’s
estates. Here, indeed, if anywhere, the words of
old showmen will apply : “ You pays your money
and takes your choice.” For Nature has provided
all that is necessary to enable the man with either
small or large income to grow anything he pleases,
and he receives every assistance at the hands of
the directors, who advance by every means in
their power the interests of their clients. On the
properties already they have some of the finest
breeding sheep, cattle, pigs, and horses in the
colony, which may be obtained on favourable
terms by selectors. In fact, it may be said that
anyone securing a section of either of these estates
has obtained the means of making a comfortable
living for himself and of leaving a good iuhetit-
anoe to his children after him.
“ There are two things needed in these

Illustrated Bits (London) borrows nearly
a page of original Bulletin matter, illustrations

the source of some of these clippings, but often —
apparently fearful of being accused of taking all
its eggs out of one basket—appends to Bulletin
items the names of other papers, live or dead.
A Victorian “ Order in Council ” has been
issued protectmg wild turkeys all the year round,

pretty well rid Victoria of bustards, and if the

locusts would, after losing a tenth ofTheir number
down the chooks’ cr ps, oat up the whole of the
fowls when tired of grazing.
The Mutual Life Insurance Company of
New York are resisting a claim for £25,000 brought
against them by the widow of the late David
Ballantyne, who shot himself some months ago.
The company refuse to pay on the grounds that,
by the conditions of his policy, they were not
liable if he died by his own hand within two
years of the po’iey’s issue, and the plaintiff argues
that her husband was in an insane state and did
not intend to kill himself. The Judge reserved
his decision.
West Australia, in the honeymoon of her
history, is having its attention directed to the
“ Gothenburg Licensing System,” as prevalent iii
Sweden. Under it the hotels are all owned and
controlled by a Licensing Co., which is Only
allowed to pay its shareholders 6 per Cent, interest
on the capital value of the concern. All afteG
profits, after first handing over to extinguished
merchants and publicans their cbinpeiisatioh duel;
are paid into the municipal and provincial trea-
suries. Thus in 1889, after paying a 6 per cent;
dividend all round, and £4022 in compensations;
no less than £37,091 was given over for publib
purposes. The hotels are run by managers oil
fixed salaries, and who,, therefore, have no interest

He was “laying low,” armed with a big
stick, for a inasher who had “insulted his Wife;”
Suddenly he Was seized by the throat by
another ; man, also armed with a stick;
“Scoundrel!” hissed the second man. Theft
they both laid into each other manfully, got
tangled, sprawled into the gutter, went adrift,
and gathered themselves Up to catch “second
Wind.” A fitful light from a street lamp, neat
Which they had fluked, caused both to pause.
“What’s the meaning of this, you scoundrel?”
gasped No. i. “O lor!” gasped the second,
“ I’m d——, et, I mean, I’m awfully sorry. I
mistook yolt for that blackguard, X, whom I
expected to be round this way. He insulted my
sister, and I’m going for him.” “Why, that’s
the villain I’m waiting for. He’s been insulting
my wife.” Then they shook hands and combined
their ambush, but X did not turn up.
According to the Hawk “one had an
opportunity of realising, during his address on
‘Australia, as I saw it,’ the secret of Lord Car-
rington’s success as a speaker at the Antipodes.
First, he caused roars of laughter and made the
ladies present hide their faces behind their fans,
by saying that the population of N.S.W. was in-
creasing as hast as possible. There are. he said,
four and a-half children to every woman in the
colony —‘l mean married women,’ he added.

he saved himself the necessity of personally
attacking the Colonial Office by reading a very
bitter criticism from a Brisbane paper. Third,

Buried Alive—A Mining Sketch.
(FOR THE BULLETIN)
It was just before Christmas, 18G4, when at eight
o’clock shift I went down to my work in the face
•it the end of a drive 200 yards from the shaft.
Two others, Bill and Jack—both Cornislnnen—
were working there. Bill was a fine, well-built
fellow witli shining eyes and-trim, short-cut,
pointed beard, and Jack was a broad-shouldered,
thick-set man and a great wrestler in his style.
Both enjoyed a reputation for drink, euchre, and
gallantry. The work in the mine (an alluvial one)
was* divided into throe eight-hour shifts, and as
wo worked like niggers when wo were at it, about
the middle of each shift a spell occurred during
which pasties were consumed and the billies
emptied of their contents. On tins particular
occasion, while tucker-time passed, the men
squatted in the drive on the loose earth which had
been picked down from the face, smoking, discuss-
ing sport, politics, and current local scandal.
During my meal and the subsequent arguments of
, n y companions I sat in a corner of the face till
time was up, when pipes were set carefully aside,
more tea taken, and to work we went again.
When men work hard the passage of time is
(scarcely noticed, but it must have been about half-
past' three when "a sound was heard wdiicli caused
us to stop and gaze fearfully at each other.
Creak, creak, creak ! Then we heard a sound of
scampering feet in the black darkness of the mine.
Creak, creak, creak, and still we gazed at eacli
other. Suddenly Jack started for a run down the
drive, but paused after a few strides, and as sud-
denly turned back again. Then followed the
sound of crashing timbers, and—whisli! the whole
of the rock above ns fell in with a dull crash that
completely paralysed our bewildered senses. The
air waathick witli dust and we were in black
the draught caused by the caving-in
having blown out the candles. Quickly I struck
a match and recalled my companions, who had
fallen prostrate, to a sense of life and such limited
responsibilities as our circumstances permitted.-
“ Great God 1” exclaimed Bill, in a husky voice,
“ the—mine has' fallen in!”
“Yes,” I replied, “the workings have come
down.”
“We’re buried alive!” gasped Bill, ids glassy
eyes seeming to protrude.
“Buried alive we are,”echoed Jack, recovering
from collapse.
Lighting our candies, we made an examination.
The rock had f dien and closed np the drive within
a few yards of where we stood. The whole open
space left was about 30 feet.
Whether the disturbance which had taken place
had destroyed the shaft, and whether any of the
workers in the mine had lost their lives, it was
impossible for us to tell. We could only con-
jecture from the preliminary creaking and crack-
ing of the timber, the sound of which seemed to
come from far down the drive, that there had
been an immense subsidence, if indeed the whole
of the workings had not caved in. Then we
huddled up against the face, and in subdued tones
discussed the aspects of our position and the pos-
sibilities and improbabilities of any deliverance,
till, suddenly throwing down his candle, Bill
rushed forward to the end of our limited area and
began to shout and cooey.
There was no echo ; his call had reached no ears
but our own, and he shrank back in despair.
I now began to realise that the opportunity had
come for me to show myself superior to these men
and to profit by the early training I had received,
hirst,* what candles had we? Each had about
three inches left of the one he had been using,
and besides one whole candle brought for emer-
gency. Being smokers, all had matches. Wo
must husband our light, and so two of
our candles were immediately extinguished.
A little tea was left in each billy, and there were
but a few crumbs of food. It was hardly possible
to conceive of a briefer inventory, and so I told
them we should have to economise our resources
m view of tardy rescue and more desperate cir-
cumstances. So we agreed to pass as much of the
time in darkness and in sleep until the end came.
So the candle was put out, and, buried deep in
the utter darkness of the bowels of the earth, we
talked until—through sheer exhaustion of brain
and body—we slept.
1 was awakened by a voice, the voice of Bill,
who was praying earnestly and with the deepest
emotion. I knew by the soundthat he Was on his
knees. Out of respect I remained as if still
asleep. Wife and children formed the subject of
his supplications. The prayer ended, I turned
round and dozed off again.
When next I awoke, Jack was engaged as Bill
had been, but his prayer was for deliverance. He
pledged himself deeply and solemnly to his Creator
for all sorts of better behaviour if only restored
to the upper air.
When Jack had finished his petition lie lit the
candle and we all sat np and talked. The pcssi-
bility of rescue of course constituted the staple
and constantly-recurring topic, but there were
wanderings away as to the probable hour of the
dry or night it might be, and speculations as to
what wives, children, and sweethearts might be
saying or doing. They would be certain to con-
clude that wo had been killed, but I affirmed con-
fidently that whether wo were thought alive or
dead there would not be one moment’s rest above
ground until our bodies were brought into the
light of day. This seemed to strike my com-
panions as likely to be true and it cheered them
considerably.
Every crumb of food had been devoured ere we
fell again into a slumber from which I again first
awoke, and at once lit the last of our three bits of
candle. How hideously cadaverous my companions
looked ! When they awoke I strove to cheer them
up a bit and told them stories to while away the
time, next we sang, and final'y we prayed in com-
pany. Then we dozed off once more.
When I next awoke, Bill was on Ins knees, con-
fessing his sins as a dying man before God. When
the candle was lighted, poor Jack seemed very
weak. I hear of men fasting forty days ; I
wonder how they contrive it. Here was .lack, a
strong man, apparently on his last legs—he was
lying down, by the way—after an abstinence (f
only two or three days, so far as one could make
out.
The heavy hours dragged slowly by, we could
no longer sing, and even prayer had become ex-
hausting. We lay silent in the .darkness, each
occupied with his own thoughts, awaiting the
end. My poor dear, broken-hearted mother ! She
was fifty, and weak, and we did not own even the
little house in which we lived.
How long this continued I know not. We lay
out-stretched, the waning remains of slowly-
perishing humanity. Suddenly I thought I heard
a sound. I started up and called Jack and Bill,
but they paid no heed to me. Then, I put my
ear to the ground and listened —listened with all
my might, my very keenest apprehension—but
could hear nothing. Yes, there it is again, dis-
tinctly a knock. “Jack—Bill—cheer up boys,
they are coming, God has heard ns, we are saved.”
I groped about for a pick, 1 rushed forward,
stumbled over Jack, who groaned, stamped upon
the hand of Bill, who swore—yes, swore—“how
use doth breed a bad habit in man ” —and was
thrown back by a concussion against the face. I
had gone the wrong way. Then I bethought me
to light a match, for I had two or three left, and
groping my way to the other end knocked with all
my strength—one, two, three. I awaited a reply,
there was none. I tried again and again and at
last despondently lay down again in my corner.
When I awoke again the noise of knocking
could be heard quite plainly. I now gathered up
what strength 1 could and devoted myself to my
companions. I got them to sit together and
poured into their ears all the words of hope and
encouragement I could think of. “Mary,”
whispered one; “Johanna, Johanna,” murmured
the other.
Though the sounds were yet a long way off I
knew by the regularity of the blows that steady,
persistent, and earnest working was going for-
ward, and that arduously engaged as the men
were it was unlikely they would hear any signals
which I could send. I did not therefore again
draw upon my own strength in attempting to
send any. They would get through right enough
—it was only a question of time and endurance. I
spoke to my companions, I strove to cheer them,
and while thus engaged became unconscious.
Upon returning to my senses, the sunshine vas
dazzling my eyes and delicious breezes were play-
ing round my temples. My dear mother, with one
arm round my neck, was kissing me, hot tears of
joy falling on her cheek the while.
“See, doctor, he lives, he opens his eyes,” she
exclaimed, in accents of great joy. “My dear
boy is given back to me —back fi om the grave—
risen from the dead—thank God ! thank God !”
“ He's all right,” said the full-bearded Dr.
Macgregor, who held a tumbler in his hand. “ I
hope the others are no worse. But look here,” he
said, addressing mother, “you must not hang
over him like that; let him have air.”
I was lying on a mattress, in the centre of a
great crowd of men and children who had ex-
citedly rushed up to the claim at the news of
rescue.
Suddenly there was a great commotion, and the
whole crowd rushed to the month of the pit.
“ Stand back ! Stand back !” I heard the mine-
manager loudly exclaim. Then I guessed that
one of my companions was being brought up the
shaft. It was Jack, and I got terribly aux’ous to
know if he still lived. A ringing cheer went up
on the arrival of the insensible form on the brace,
and another cheer went up when the doctor smiled
and nodded. Mary and her children were frantic
with joy, and a sympathising crowd surrounded
them. Shortly after, Bill was brought up to the
surface, and he, tco, was still alive. Then cheer
after cheer was given, the Mayor leading, for the
brave hearts and strong arms that day and night
had worked with ceaseless energy for our deliver-
ance.

“Is it Sunday, mother? what are the
bells ringing for ? ” I asked when reclining on the
couch by the window of our little room.
“No. my boy,” was the answer, “it is Christ-
mas day.”
“ Christmas ! Then we were only six days
buried — 1 thought it had been at least a fortnight.”
“A little more than six days, and my boy has
risen from the dead.”

A very young Southern detective of
under four years’ service would, if put through the
stampers, be found to consist chiefly of rings,
diamonds, and watches, all “presents.” Each
article has its history engraven on it. How would
he pan out after twenty years’ service?
Story told of “Orange Blossom,” an
old Melbourne professional sporting writer : The
penny concerts in aid of the hospital were a great
success, and whenever the proceeds amounted to
oyer £2O a hospital life-governor was made by the
hospital-committee at the nomination of the con-
cert-committce. As only one life-governor could
be made at a time, and there were invariably a
dozen candidates for the honour, words ran high,
especially on one particular occasion, when it was
at last decided to leave the matter to “ Orange
Blos-om,” whose answer was: “Put the money
on the two Barbs (at 100 to 1), and you can all be
made life-governors and have something to spare
for the next good thing.” The double came off
(two Cups), but it wasn’t backed, and so only one
lifer was made.
Editor Bulletin. —Sir,—-Touching your
narrative re the late “Greasy Bill,” who was
lately eaten by the Sud-est niggers, I fail to see
any necessity to waste sympathy over Bill afore-
said, who had long been looking for the fate he
ultimately met. Whatever he may have been as
a miner in the early days of the North, he was
certainly no credit of late years to the class to
which he professed to belong. Owing to the cause
from which ho derived his nickname, he was com-
pelled to work as a hatter—when he did work.
So far as I could see in the Ear North, most of
his time was spent with the blacks as one of
themselves. Were the full truth known, it might
be found that the niggers had other reasons for
making “long pig” of Bill than the mere desire
to become possessed of his “ swag of tombavgo. ”
Cannibals though the Sud-Esters be they must
have had strong provocation ere making a feast
off Greasy Bilk I wish them joy of their dinner.
From my experience of the natives of that island
I think that if men act with prudence and
treat them fairly, their—the white men’s
lives are as safe on Sud-Est as in any part of
Sydney under ordinary circumstances. As to
the statement that Sir William M'Gregor
treats the miners “as a lot of lawless adven-
turers,” I can only say, from my own observa-
tions, that a better man for the miners or one more
suitable for the position he holds would be hard
to find. I was one of the party of miners who
accompanied him on his “questionable trip
through the Louisiades,” and can vouch for his
great assistance and kindness to the party. He
freely gave us every assistance in prospecting the
various islands, and was always to the front, rifle
in hand, when danger threatened from the natives.
The firm stand he took in securing and executing
the murderers of Anson at Chads Bay will go a
long way in disposing of the charge that he sym-
pathises with the niggers as against the whites. —

A certain Melbourne detective going

into the next room and to the “D.’s ” great sur-
prise put a cigar box containing 90 sovereigns into
his hand, saying, “ I didn’t steal it, so you needn’t

headquarters, and, as no owner appeared, the
woman claimed it, but was put off by the officials.
She died and, strange to say, a week afterwards a
man turned up, claimed the £9O, and got it.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
In the stuffy, tin-roofed shed that did duty as
pourt-house, at Combalong, sat Trooper William
Russell, better known as “ Ratcatcher.” He was
engrossed in the perusal of a placard which had
arrived for his information by that morning’s mail,
but occasionally varied his employment by glancing
at the distant hills swimming in the purple haze
of a warm afternoon.
Strange though it might seem, there was a cer-
tain connection between placard and mountain
peak, for out in those ranges, hunted like a dingo,
with a price upon his head, lay the subject of the
proclamation which set forth that the sum of £SLO
would be paid by Government for the apprehen-
sion of James Dodd, alias Ferguson, alias Mackay,
alive or dead.
Trooper Russell, in his official capacity as officer
in charge of Combalong station, could not but re
gard the outlaw’s presence in his district as an
offence almost amounting to personal insult,
though at the same time, as a former comrade, he
felt a natural pang of regret when he thought of
the probable fate of the sharer in many a boyish
escapade.
Neveitheless, dwelling on the amount of the
reward, it was easy to conjure up a picture of
himself as owner and occupier of a snug three-and-
twenty acres on the Bullenbong, and, alluring
thought, with a certain damsel in charge of its
domestic economy.
Musing thus the officer proceeded to post the
proclamation on the Court-house notice-board,
and having completed his afternoon's writing,
closed up and betook himself to his lodgings.
Two days afterwards, acting upon ‘‘informa-
tion received,” Trooper Russell might have been
seen cautiously threading the golden mazes of the
wattle which clothed the slopes of a spur from the
Black Range. Some distance up the gully a
thin, blue column of smoke, which stole gently
heavenward through the cool crisp air, marked
the presence of a camp to which the officer was
slowly making his way.
Conscious that any nearer approach would only
lead to instant detection and allow the criminal,
if it were he, time to seek cover, he hung his
horse’s bridle on a branch, and after ' carefully
examining his revolver, silently proceeded towards
his destination on foot. So successfully did he
achieve his object that it was only when the
trooper stepped forward with a stern challenge
that the outlaw, who had been preparing a frugal
breakfast, became conscious of his presence.
Quick as thought the bushranger pulled trigger,
but the sharp snap which followed bore witness
to the futility of the attempt. Ere he could again
raise his weapon the trooper had him covered and
said
“ Don’t stir, Jim Dodd, or you’re a dead man ;
drop that pistol and lift your hands.”
The man made no move to obey, but his voice
was not altogether steady as he replied :
“Won’t you give me a show, Bill? I didn’t
know who it was at first, or I wouldn’t have
pulled. Bill, old man—no one knows we have
met here —ride on and reckon you never found
me.”
Trooper Russell, with a set face, spoke but the
one word—“ Surrender !”
“Bill,” cried the unhappy man, “won’t yon
give me a chance —for the sake of old times, for
the sake of that day that I dragged you, half-
drowned, from the bogey-hole in Sawyer’s Creek ?
A life for a life, Bill, that’s only fair,”
Again the stern command rang out; again tho
passionate appeal for liberty was poured forth.
“ Bill, do you mind the time when you and I
and the boys used to play at ‘ bushies and
bobbies ’ in the scrub at the back of the old
school-house—we’re only playing now, Bill, aren’t
we? You’ll give old Jimmy Dodd a show. Bill,
say that you’ll give him a show.”
In the dead silence that followed, a curious
soldier-bird alighted above their heads, and, to
the trooper’s excited imagination, seemed to chant
a mocking refrain. “Alive or dead. Alive or
dead,” was the burden of its song. For the last
time he looked steadily at his onetime comrade
and spoke. Clear and sharp came his ultimatum :
“ Do you throw up your hands ?”
“ NO ! ” and with a quick gesture Jim Dodd
fired.
Their weapons flashed almost simultaneously,
but as the smoke cleared Trooper William Russell
might have been seen standing unharmed, with a
fellow-creature, value £5OO, bleeding at his feet.
SURCINGLE.
The heirs (supposed to be in Australia) of
Mr. James Randall, late of a ramshackle-named
place in Lower California, are exhorted to hurry
over to Mexico and claim the estate. If they don’t
turn up in person, or by proxy, before 18th June,
the Mexican Republic will calmly annex James’
money, so far as The Bulletin can make out.
Therefore, should this meet the eye of anyone
called Randall, he had better pack up and begone.
Two Wanganui ladies took possession of a
shop-counter and commenced having a “delicious
chat.” An old Maori, who wanted to buy a pair
of boot-laces, waited respectfully for his turn for
a full half-hour, and then, losing patience, un-
ceremoniously burst between the matrons, banged
the counter with his dusky fist, and said —“Ka
kino te wahine, too much te korero ! All a same
as te kai larke—chip-ee ! chip-ee 1! chip-ee ! ! !
chip-ee !! ! !” Where in the whole world lives a
man who can’t translate that ?
A gruesome story concerning a garotter
and a member of Parliament has somehow leaked
out in Melbourne. It was on one of the closing
nights of the session, and the representative was
wandering homeward in peaceful meditation at a
late hour, when a great, hairy arm was deposited
round his neck as unexpectedly as a large sum of
money being deposited to meet a cheque of the
N.S.W. Education Department. Naturally
enough the law-maker was surprised at the inci-
dent, but he hit backwards over his head with his
walking-stick, and by great, good luck nearly
disabled his assailant’s spine with the knob ana
made him let go. Then he solemnly turned
round and floored the astounded brigand, and, the
street being deserted, he sat on him and went
through his pockets, realising £1 IBs. 4d. in cash, a
pipe, some tobacco, a box of matches, and an old
silver watch. Finally he annexed his assailant’s
hat, tore his coat, told him he had a good mind to
take his boots as well, and let him go; but, on an
afterthought, chased him down the street, and
gave him a severe kick While skimming round the
corner.
Hope Deferred.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ See yonder stony terrace there.
Skirting the mountain sides,
Yellow and bare, excepting where
That clump of fern a whare hides ?
A whare built of slabs and clay,
In which there lived for many a year
A battered man, thin, worn and grey,
Whom all the country counted ‘ queer.*
He’d been a digger since forty-nine,
When he worked in the California State,
Made his pile and lost it, like other men,
Then sailed out South through the Golden Gate.
On Austral fields, with feverish thirst,
He strove to retrieve his loss in vain—
Tis a saying ’mong those with the lust accurst,
That no man e’er makes his pile again.
“ He found, so he said, on the eastern side
Of the range, right over by Langley Dale,
A reef he knew would be rich if tried ;
But one man only believed his tale.
Tom Hopgood—Dick, you remember him ?
In the old man’s yarn expressed belief.
And, leaving for England, told looney Jim
He’d bring back money to work that reef.
I left next week, and Jim hung on,
But of Tom and his money no more was heard,
Tho’ three long years had come and gone,
And his heart grew sick from hope dcfei red.
Three years and a month had gone ; at last,
While Batsy Flynn was digging a drain,
A horseman came riding slowly past—-
Twas the missing Hopgood turned up again.
Pat dragged him up to his hut to dine,
And during the meal they heard a shot.
Says Pat: ‘ ’Tis that crazy old mate of mine
A-trying for something to fill his pot.’
“ With a lightsome heart and a heavy purse,
Tom said, as he climbed the terraced track,
‘The place, all round, has changed for the worse ;
Old Jim will be happy to see me back.’
But he saw, as he stepped through the shanly-
door,
What he’ll never forget till his days are done :
In a pool of blood on the earthen floor
Old Jim lay dead beside his gun.
Hope long deferred had begot despair ;
Tom could but wail, ‘ Too late, too late !
While I was laughing with Tom down there
I hastened the end of my poor old mate.’
“They buried him by the manuka-tree
Where that clump of lawyers and bulibul grows.
But where the reef that he found may bo
I cannot tell you, for no one knows.”

A young Honorable named Cyril Lech-
mere, at present acquiring “colonial experience,”
got a fair dose at one swallow, the other day,
when charged at Bathurst, N.S.W., with illegally
using a horse, the property of the local police-
magistrate. As Lechmere, who is very short-
sighted, had in the darkness merely taken the
magistrate’s horse in mistake for his own, it only
cost him a night in the cells and the case was
withdrawn. One horse looks very much like
another to your ordinary new-chum —who rarely
can pick out of a yard where there are only three
horses the moke on which he has worked a 25-mile
passage on the previous day. We know a man
who, 14 years ago, started out from Deniliquin on
a £25 horse with a brand new rig-out from Alison’s.
They rang the changes on him at every shanty on
the way, and he arrived at Wilcannia with a
stagger-kneed, sore-backed moke that hadn’t
strength enough to kick the flies off, a hairless
saddle, and a bridle chiefly composed of string.
His misfortunes didn’t end here, for he was
arrested on a charge of stealing his last horse from
a Chinese gentleman, and being unknown in the
locality it would have gone hard with him had
some good Christian not considerately removed
the slip-rails from the police-paddock and allowed
tire evidence of his guiltless crime to escape.

What w© are Prepared 4© do.
We are prepared to supply 100,000 of the Australa-
sian public with samples of FRAZER’S SULPHUR
TABLETS, gratis and post free.
A Word ©f Adwice.
Don’t write for the samples simply because we offer
them free of charge, nor because your neighbour does.
Road our advertisement through to the end, and then
decide whether you or yours need or would be benefited
by the use of 'FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS.
We do not pose ,as philanthropists. This is a business
offer. We have an article that we know from severe
tests and from results achieved will sell on its merits if
seen, tasted and tested. Sulphur is the oldest, the best,
and safest remedy for the blood, for the skin, for the
complexion, for rheumatism, and for constipation.
FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS are composed of
sulphur incorporated with cream of tartar and other
curative ingredients. They are much more efficacious
than sulphur in milk or treacle. This has been proved
time and again. They are liked. Men favour them,
women hail them as a boon, and children think them as
pleasant to eat as confectionary. They benefit all, and
are as efficacious and curative as they are safe and agree-
TJfeoaj? Biiiecess,
“ FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS” are the
latest and greatest British success. They have so much
merit as to always do good. They are so palatable and
agreeable that a child will take them with delight. They
are so safe that the weakest person may take them with-
out injury. They benefit every function of the body by
tonic action on the blood vessels.
Why do we take this Itisk ?
This is what people ask us. We reply, because
those who write for the samples afterwards buy packets
of FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS by post from
us, or obtain them from chemists, stores, or medicine
vendors. People likewise recommend and keep the
r lablets by them. Ihe consequence is that we sell several
hundred dozen packets weekly, and the sale is rapidly
growing. This is trade by merit. The public have
shown discrim nation, and that they can appreciate merit,
and it was in firm reliance that this would be the case
that we were led to incur this risk.
So I meed them ?
If you have Rheumatism, Yes. They will kill the
decomposed and poisonous excess of uric acid in the blood
causing’ the disease.
If you have Constipation, Yes. They are a gentle,
safe, and a simple laxative, as suitable for children (in
smaller doses) as for adults.
If you have Hemorrhoids, Yes. They relieve the
congestion of venous blood at the affected parts, and
afford relief.
If you have Ulcers, Scrofula, Scurvy, or other
impurities of the blood, Yes. They neutralise the blood
poisons causing the diseases and expel them out of the
system.
If you have Skin Disease or Eruption, Yes. They
have a specific curative effect on all such, as they open
the pores from internally, and free them from obstruction
and disease taint. They likewise control where they do
not kill the disease principle from the blood, which, causes
Eczema and other diseases.
Write a letter or post-card to the Australasian Depot, naming The Bulletin, and samples of FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS
will be sent you gratis and post free. They are for internal use for the Blood, Skin, Fevers, Complexion, Rheumatism, and Constipation. They
ward off Typhoid and all-other infectious and contagious diseases. They are put up in packets, price in New South Wales, Is. 6d.; in Victoria,
Is. 9d. (postage 2d. per packet extra), of all chemists and storekeepers throughout Australasia.
» - If your Chemist or Storekeeper cannot supply them apply to the Australian Agency.

Manager Dibbs, of the Commercial Bank-
ing Co., of Sydney, says that people who have
money invested in stations would be glad to get it
out and be free with a loss of ten per cent, or even
more: that stations, at present, return on an
average only six per cent., and that station pro-
perty is fetching 50 per cent, less than formerly.
A retiring N.S.W. rabbit-inspector was
asked ty fill up a certain departmental return.
Here is an extract from the paper he sent in :
Question, “ How many rabbits arc there in your
district?” Answer, “Goodness only knows, I
don’t.” Q., What do you think the proper height
for a rabbit-proof fence? ’ A., “ Sufficiently high
to prevent a man slinging rabbits over it.”
Someone tvrites to the London Stah
suggesting that the (millionaire) Duke of Bedford
“ put tin end to himself, because his accounts were
wrong and ho could not face the shame of dis-
covery.” The Hawk, failing to recognise the
delightful satire underlying the words, denounces
the stupidity of “ the genius who could reduce the
suicide of the biggest London landlord to the
sordid level of the boy who had stolen eighteen-
pence worth of stamps.” Poor Hawk!
Characteristically enough, Premier Parkes
was the only speaker at the Imperial Federation
Banquet who addressed the Earl of Jersey as
“My Lord.” The other speakers acknowledged
Parkes as “Mister Chairman,”and Jarscy as
“ Yer Exc’ll’ncy.” When Parkes pompously
rolled out the luscious “My Lord ” aforesaid,
someone ejaculated, “MyG dl’ It couldn t
have been “ W. tk Sydney,” or the “Kyardinal?”
There was, some months ago, a Grand
Lodge election in the order of Good Tempkary.
One candidate for the position of Grand Worthy
Chief Templar—whatever that - may be—sought
the bubble, popularity, by announcing his inten-
tion to give a special donation of £25 to the funds
for the general work of Good Tomplary. At the
election, however, he got badly left. When ap-
plied to recently for his promised contribution,
lie said; “I haven't got sufficient faith in the
present executive to entrust them with ±25 of my
money.” And the deputation of the “Noble
Order ” retired in disorder.
The sympathy of those behind the scenes
appears * to be completely with Treasurer
MMillan in his matrimonial troubles ; it is agreed
that he acted in a merciful and even soft-hearted
way, and staved off divorce-proceedings as long as
he possibly could. The Bulletin, of course,
takes strong exception to the secret manner in
which the action—an undefended one—was
heard ; for the making of a pointed exception
in favour of a high political official is unworthy of
the dignity of the Supreme Court, before which
all citizens should be equal.
A. A. Mayou, late clerk to the Thorn-
borough Divisional Board, North Queensland,
passed in his final checks last month. Old
Ballarat men of a quarter of a century ago will
remember him as a man who made a lucky rise of
some thousands in Band and Albion Consols, and
dropped it suddenly in Winter’s Freeholds. He
next appeared as an hotel-keeper in Cooktown,
dabbled in Palmer-rush booms with varying luck,
and eventually pegged out at Thoruborough. He
was a broad-minded Liberal who fancied himself
an enthusiastic Conservative and had “pretty”
manners.
English paper: —“The lovely diamonds
bequeathed to Lord Carnarvon by his aunt, Lady
Stapleton, will remain in the family for an heir-
loom.” Yes, till the right heir looms up to Ben-
zonise them, until which time the benison will
last. In about three-quarters of a century, or a
great deal less, there’ll be the inquiry—“I thay,
ain’t there no diamondth?” when the sportive
young Lord Benzine will slap his knee and
exclaim, “Fool, fool, that I was !” The diamonds
will ultimately appear on the palatial front of
Miss Rahab Thoothsalem, with one to spare for
pa’s shirt bosom.
They are considering the advantages of
imprisonment for contempt of court in Pennsyl-
vania, and the general opinion is that the old law
has a good many drawbacks. An alleged clergy-
man over there seduced a lady under promise of
marriage, and when the court awarded £(1000
damages he rose and stated briefly that the judge
and jury, and the U. S. Constitution, and the
Declaration of Independence and the spirit of the
immortal Washington might all go and frizzle in
Tuphet before he would pay a cent. Then the
court got up in a towering fury, and sent him to
gaol indefinitely. He proved a model prisoner,
and used to preach to the other inhabitants of the
gaol with such fervour that they almost all became
converted, and there was so little for the warders
to do that they grew careless, for a gaol with 200
broken-hearted penitents in it needed practically
no supervision at all. And so things went on for
a while till one day the parson and most of the
contrite Christians surprised the warders with
spades and crowbars, and crippled them, and
then bolted. The majority were recaptured, but
the reverend gentleman has never been seen since.
A strange story comes to The Bulletin
from Western Australia. We give it on the
authority of one who, until lately, was one of the
principal pearl-shellers on the North-West coast
and whose word is undoubted in his own circle.
Some short time back the Government resident at
Derby, who was then in the police department,
made an excursion some 120 miles to the North-
East of that town, in the direction of Kimberley.
While there they interviewed some of the wild
blacks and found amongst them a white youth
about 17 years of age. He had been brought up
among the blacks and could not speak English.
Further enquiries elicited the fact that his mother
was also living with the tribe, and presumably had
been with them for many years. On his return he
communicated the discovery to the Government
in Perth, expecting instructions to follow the dis-
covery up, and much to his surprise was told to
let the matter rest. And there it has rested since.
This is Western Australia all over. In Queensland
the truth would have, been routed out immediately,
but in the new province which has just emerged
from leading-strings, no headquarters official does
anything except under compulsion.
A Sydney evening paper the other night
printed two long items in very big type. One
was the leading article; the other a scissored
American yarn about rumours concerning a certain
English Club for the commission of unnatural
offences.
Artist Charles Keene, of London Punch,
used to smoke the ancient clay pipes, almost as
thick in the stem as the bowl, found in the
Thames’ bed and various London excavations,
smoked by the soldiers of the Commonwealth, and
made, it is said, in Holland.
Head-master Buggy, of Albury, has re-
ceived a complimentary letter and a bonus of £2
from the N.S.W. Department of Public Instruc-
tion congratulating him upon the discovery by
one of his pupils of a parasite which destroys
grasshoppers. The Minister further encouraged
Mr. Buggy to continue his instructions on para-
sites. If he does, he will be Buggy in a Yankee
and entomological instead of in a Yankee and
vehicular sense.
What the newspaper likes to get hold of
is a good, strong, keen individuality, and the Mel-
bourne interviewers have just got such in a Miss
Silcock, Bossess of the Deaconesses, from IIing-
land. “I don’t want to be interviewed,” she
shrieked, but they sent a journalistic Benedick
after her, and he educes a column and a half.
The ingratitude of the poor is her theme, and she
says she’s going back to dear old England, where
they say “Thank you” and touch their hats (for-
giving them about one eighth per cent, of their
own).
The London & Sydney Tea Co. supply squatters
and farmers at wholesale prices.
One by one the men who during th®
various recent. Australian land-booms made for-
tunes by commissions, but elected to job all the
same, are becoming insolvent.
Dr. Windthorst, octogenarian head of the
German Ultramontanes, is very like Thiers. A
diminutive man in specs., with head as big as a
pumpkin.. As a young man, his ladylove despised
him, but married him because his short sight
made him fall in a gutter while serenading her.
A new idea from an American book,
“Aaron Burr’s Life.” As a military officer, he
had to send away a large number of prisoners,
handcuffed to each other, with a very small guard
of soldiers. Aaron cut the strings of all the
prisoners’ breeches, so they had to hold them up
with one hard.
In Switzerland any citizen who sees a hoy
under fourteen smoking in the streets, is authorised
to take his pipe .from him and then thrash him
violently on the spot. But there is nothing in
the Swiss Constitution which explains what will
happen if the boy should chance to wallop the
citizen instead.
Dear Bulletin—There is a pretentious
Book called Hamilton’s Collection of Parodies,

or the publish' r. Yet they say that the Yankees

The public eye rejects us uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers o;
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin wai
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become a vast property, because it pos.
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin's inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established A us-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress : it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges, A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonics.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

SWORN CERTIFICATE.—One of Thousands more
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888.
To 11. F. Kcoelmaxx, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. J consulted
more than one doctor, and during that-time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, hut 1 became worse every day, wasting away until
1 became a perfect skeleton. About February last Tbegan
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, X became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken had one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time 1 commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every da} - . About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.
Declared and subscribed before me, one of Her Majesty’s
Justices of the Peace, for tho Southern Bailiwick, in the
County of Grant, this 10th day of December, 1888.
