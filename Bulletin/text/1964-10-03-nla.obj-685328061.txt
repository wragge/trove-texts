HOSE
The United States has announced the
development of the super jet, the Lock-
heed A-11. This top-secret aircraft,
years ahead of even the TFX, is con-
structed mainly of titanium. Major source
of titanium is rutile and Australia ha 3
almost 90 per cent of world supplies.
Goodyear comes right into the picture
with the important part Goodyear hoses
play in the reclamation of this important
mineral.
There’s no tougher job for hose than
handling mineral sands. Goodyear handies
it better than any other hose in the world.
Abrasion rides high as mineral sands grind their way from
sea-bed to concentrate plant. Day in, day out millions of tons
of sand travel through Goodyear Material Conducting Hose.
Because of their outstanding endurance, their amazing longevity
under rubber-rending pressure, Goodyear Material Conducting
Hoses are chosen by the Associated Minerals Group. Through
Goodyear hose comes the vital materials to send the world’s
fastest planes hurtling through the sky.
Twenty ft. length of 8 in. Material Conducting Hose operating on

National Notebook
Straight To The Heart
Wf earing a silk dressing-gown as
™ * quiet as himself, Segovia received
us in his hotel at midday of the day
following his first concert in Sydney. We
thought perhaps he had just got up; but
no. “This morning I have practised about
three hours and a half,” he said. “The
guitar is very difficult.” Yes, he said, he
sometimes felt a little tired after con-
certs. “There are many thousands of
notes, each in its place,” he explained.
The sense of a liking for things in their
place came up again. “I very much
incline to order,” he observed in his
slow, unemphatic way. “I like the con-
jugation of order and liberty.”
We asked Segovia, who is now 71, to
describe his itinerary for 1964. “First I
played in Austria, Germany, Italy,
France, England and Switzerland,” he
said. “That was at the beginning of the
year. Then I went to the United States
for about 36 concerts up to the end of
April, then to Spain to rest in Madrid
for 15 days. Then I went to London
again, to Switzerland and Paris, and
after that to Spain again, and then to
California, where 1 teach. Then comes
this tour of Australia and New Zealand,
and after that I go back to Spain. There
are about 120 concerts in the year.” As
he sat recalling these details, his big
hands disposing of them with calm
gestures, it struck us that we had met
the world’s most quiet-spirited traveller
of the jet age
Segovia told us that he never plays
pieces he doesn’t like, and that when he
gives a concert, “the public must
behave” Before his first Australian visit,
in 1961, he had heard disturbing reports
of restless audiences. “But I had a
tremendous surprise,” he said, as if still
feeling the relief, “the people were so
silent.” His conversation kept coming
back to the guitar and to the appreciation
its music now enjoys. “It speaks straight
to the heart.” For himself he hoped that
perhaps his best performances still lay
in the future. “Life is not long enough
to accomplish perfection on one instru-
ment,” he said.
The Glittering Bit
Hai.e, when he was shot by
the British during the Revolution-
ary War, said: ‘I have but one life to give
for my country’,’ Sir Howard Beale
said. “I used to paraphrase this by say-
ing. ‘I have but one stomach to give for
my country’.”
Sir Howard gave his stomach for his
country, as lie puts it. during his 6J years
as Ambassador to Washington. He and
his valorous stomach are now back in
Sydney where the boards of companies
will probably in time substitute for the
lavish boards of Washington hostesses.
He does not intend to go back into poli-
tics, nor resume his legal career. How-
ever, he decided a short while ago that
it was time, at 65, to come back to
Australia and establish a new life “be-
fore it was too late”. “I admit now that
in the first place I went to Washington
with some reluctance,” he said. “I did
not know whether I should leave my
Cabinet job. Then there was some recent
soul-searching whether, as events stood,
I should give up my post in Washington.
However, I realise that that job will
never be finished. There is always some
new situation to meet.”
Sir Howard described diplomatic life
as an “iceberg”, the “glittering bit above
the surface” being the constant enter-
tainment. “The political work goes on all
the time,” he said, “but the most valu-
able contacts are made socially. When
you realise that I served under three
Presidents, three Secretaries of State and
three Secretaries of Defence, and that,
according to the American political sys-
tem, literally hundreds of lesser posts
changed hands in my time, the demands
on my time were considerable.
“I suppose the Australian taxpayer
thinks of us as riding around in a Cadil-
lac all day, enjoying life, but I tell you
it is most exhausting.”
Sir Howard, still settling into an office
in Pitt Street, admitted that there was
some little difficulty in adjusting to pri-
vate life after 18 years of public life, and
some little difficulty in adjusting to Aus-
tralians after living among Americans.
“Americans seem sentimental and out-
going by comparison,” he said. “The
humor is different. Australians have a
more sardonic and critical attitude. I
find that the jokes which went over
well in America don’t go down so well
here.”
Although Sir Howard is no longer in
public life, he hopes he still has some-
thing to offer the community. “Having
spent 6i years interpreting Australia
for the Americans, I should like now
to interpret America for Australians,”
he said. “The most pressing subject, I
feel, is American foreign policy. If
America sometimes sounds querulous
and demanding, we must remember that
she has two million men in uniform, one
million of them overseas, and that she
has the biggest defence budget pro rata
in the world, no less than 60 per cent,
of the Budget. But South-East Asia is
just one of their problems and we can’t
expect them to be preoccupied with it
to the exclusion of other areas. I think
Australian citizens simply must face up
to the stark fact that we are living in
a dangerous world and it is not likely
to get any better.
“Australians will have to do more and
pay more. We must do more to develop
our country and pay more to defend it.”
Sir Howard said that although Amer-
ica, he felt, expected Australia to do
more for her own defence, American
officials had never thumped the table,
telling him what they thought Australia
should do. “I knew Rusk and McNamara
well,” he said. “They became personal
friends, but Washington officials respect
the fact that Australia is an independent
country.”
A long , cool look at Max
“Tt was a happy inspiration.” wrote
Mr Max Harris in his “Browsing
with Max” book column in “The Aus-
tralian” recently, “when the Australian
Penguin organisation came up with the
idea that we need a national equivalent
to Sampson’s ‘Anatomy of Britain’.
“It is time,” Mr Harris suggested,
“that Australians took a long, cool look
at themselves.” The long, cool look,
he implied, was taken in Penguin’s
“happy inspiration” Mr Donald
Horne’s forthcoming “The Lucky
Country”.
Mr Harris is too modest. He should
have made it clear that he is on the
editorial board of Penguins.
Victoria’s Animal Crackers
r I ''hose who can take animals or leave
A them alone are often struck with
the notion that Nature, red in tooth and
claw, is seldom redder or toothier than
among the friends of our dumb friends.
To support this notion, seething under-
currents erupted at the recent annual
meeting of the 93-year-old Royal Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
The meeting had its sparkling sallies,
such as one during a debate on whether
rodeos were cruel to the horses par-
ticipating. Veterinary student: Our pro-

In the weeks before the meeting, the
800 RSPCA members had been deluged
with electioneering matter. A “Reform
Committee” issued a 12-page booklet,
bearing the picture of a bawling calf on
the cover. It described the alleged
inertia of the RSPCA, its failure to
obtain more convictions for cruelty, and
its disposal of funds, and urged members
to vote for 10 reform committee can-
didates in the RSPCA election of office-
bearers and committee.
A how-to-vote RSPCA ticket anti-
Reform Committee —listed such interest-
ing personalities as the Dean of Mel-
bourne, the Very Rev. T. W. Thomas;
Major-General L. G. H. Dyke, a former
Australian Military Attache at Washing-
ton; and Brigadier H. R. F. Officer, well
known in bird-loving circles. This ticket
was supported by a circular from Mr
George Sutton, Tailwagger-in-Chief of
Australia.
What has caused such unwonted tur-
moil in the venerable and respected
RSPCA? Officials say the opposition is
not a breakaway but outsiders wanting
to “muscle in” and gain control of the
Society’s work and assets. Some of the
Reform Committee, they say, have been
members of the RSPCA for as brief a
time as two years. The Society points
to its long years of quiet but steady
achievement, and its thousands of keen
junior members, and says that extrava-
gant and impractical schemes could
bankrupt the Society and bring about its
collapse.
Spearhead of RSPCA activities is the
tiny and indefatigable secretary, Miss
Victoria E. Carter. Miss Carter has
been with the Society for 22 years. Her
difficulties with “outside influences”
began several years ago. She has had
anonymous letters that suggest, for
example, “Why don’t you pack up and
let do the job?” She has also
had telephone callers in the small hours,
demanding to know what the Society
has done with its Government grant (of
£750).
Announcer s Eye View
JjV>UR years ago Radio 2SM, Sydney,
began to broadcast reports on the
city’s peak-hour traffic, transmitting
from cars at chronic trouble-spots. Late
last month, taking a leaf out of the book
°f its sister station 3UZ in Melbourne,
2SM added a daily aerial reconnaissance
to this service, and on an overcast morn-
ing recently we got up early and went
along for the flight.
Kevin O'Donohue, the station mana-
ger, has been giving the broadcasts him-
self, and it was in his company at Mas-
cot that we climbed into a chartered
Cessna piloted by Keith Robey. A few
minutes before 7 a.m. we were rising
smartly from the runway and heading
for Torn Ugly’s Bridge, over George’s
River, where the survey begins.
The 2SM aircraft, flying at 1500 feet,
makes three circuits of the metropolitan
area lasting about two hours. In this
period, O'Donohue broadcasts nine re-
ports for motorists on the state of the
highways. His total time on the air is
about a minute and a half, so that one
way and another these must be costly
little messages. Even so, 2SM finds
that its reports are good business.
“They're the most talked-about thing we
do,” O'Donohue told us.
From Tom Ugly's, the aircraft flies to
Parramatta Road at Strathfield, then
across to the old Gladesville Bridge (the
worst of all bottlenecks), the Spit Bridge,
the Harbor Bridge, and finally back to
the Mascot area for a view of General
Holmes Drive. The day we were on
board, O’Donohue seemed to think the
traffic situation was very quiet. “No
problems this morning,” he said after a
while, like a host who regrets that poor
sport is offering for the visitor. “The
time you really ought to be up here is
when there’s a transport strike.”
But to our eyes, looking at Sydney
stretched out below like a sick beast,
the swarming traffic seemed enough of
an infestation. We saw cars nudging
along, cars putting a spurt on, cars
bunching together and teasing apart, all
running out of little roads between the
red roofs to ioin bigger roads heading
for town. There were no people in
sight, only cars. It looked as if the cars
had taken over.
At eight o'clock the Cessna was
ordered out of the way by the airport
tower while four airliners in succession
thundered into the air and passed harm-
lessly from sight. “DCA give us a very
good go,” said O'Donohue, as the tower
gave us permission to proceed. “Some
of them get touchy when there are jets
about, though.”
Whenever O'Donohue made a broad-
cast, Keith Robey throttled back to
reduce the noise. It was a worrying
courtesy. The trouble was for
O'Donohue to find something worth-
while to report. We went to Parramatta
Road again to look at a stopped truck
that was blocking a lane at Homebush;
but it didn’t amount to much, and the
road was soon clear. Even Gladesville
Bridge, where on our second circuit the
cars were banked up for a mile or so,
only earned a routine comment: “Nor-
mal delays are to be expected . . .”
At a quarter to nine, O'Donohue re-
corded a message for the last broadcast,
and called it a day. A few minutes later
the Cessna had landed at Mascot and we
all climbed out. Robey took off again
at once for his base at Bankstown, and
with O'Donohue we got into a 2SM
Holden and took off for the city, one
more car for the swarm.

"INDECENT BOOKS"
feuLLetin
80 Years Ago: October 11, 1884
nP-HE recent seizure of books alleged
A to be indecent (“The Fruits of
Philosophy” by Mrs Annie Besant
and Charles Bradlaugh, and “The
Elements of Social Science” by Dr
Knowlton) opens up a curious ques-
tion. The charge made by Police-
Inspector Anderson was not that they
were merely indecent, but that they
were, as the DAILY TELEGRAPH
puts it, pernicious. Mr Anderson al-
leged that, if the principles of some
of the works were carried out, “the
present constitution of society would
be overthrown”. Well, what of that?
The present constitution of society is
no part of Divine revelation, and to
seek to alter or subvert it is no offence
against either law or religion. But, it
may be said, the plan suggested in
these books would not improve upon
the present constitution of society.
Perhaps not. That is a matter of
opinion. And, of a surety, there
is no indecency or illegality in pro-
pounding in good faith a philo-
sophical or social system which fails
to penetrate the intellect of a Metho-
distical Inspector of Police. “The
constitution of society” has been
overthrown repeatedly, and by every
successive change mankind has been
in the long run the gainer.
It is about time that the laws with
respect to indecent publications were
placed upon an intelligible basis. The
plain fact is that the height of ab-
surdity is arrived at in placing the
grown men of the community under
the literary censorship of a pious
peeler.

"And how long have you been In P.R.?"


PLAIN ENGLISH
Goldwater and Australia
Although the American Pre-
sidential election is regarded as
the world’s election, Australians are
especially concerned since our whole
national survival depends on the
American alliance and the con-
tinuation of America’s commitment
to South-East Asia. In particular
Australians are concerned with what
difference the unlikely victory of
Senator Goldwater would make to
American policy.
So it is a pity when relevant and
strong criticisms can readily be made
of Senator Goldwater that so many bad
ones are made instead. Critics tend to
miss Senator Goldwater’s main weak-
nesses by concentrating, for example,
on his alleged racism, when those
American racists who now support
him regard him simply as the lesser
of two evils, as an anti-racist who
happens also to uphold States Rights;
or on Senator Goldwater’s advocacy
of the NATO commander having the
right to make independent decisions
about the use of tactical nuclear
weapons in certain circumstances,
when the Kennedy-Johnson Adminis-
tration has already given him pre-
cisely that right; or on his alleged
inconsistency in wanting both to
reduce income tax and increase the
defence budget, when he believes
no doubt wrongly that, by a
merciless reduction of Federal ex-
penditure in a variety of fields, enough
will still be left to increase defence
expenditure.
These policies constitutional,
military, economic may be bad
ones, but not for the reasons usually
given, and there are more relevant
criticisms available.
Senator Goldwater’s political faith
has many facets, but his economic pro-
gramme his advocacy of balanced
budgets and reduced taxes does not
directly concern Australians, except in
respect of his economic protectionism,
his attack on “corrosive waves of im-
ports”, which include Australian beef.
But his ideas that do directly affect
Australians concern foreign policy. In
essence he advocates a policy of con-
temptuous toughness towards the
Communist powers instead of the
present policy of “weakness and
appeasement”. But one does not find in
his writings any understanding of
Communism beyond a rough grasp of
its messianic and aggressive character-
istics; one finds no idea of how to
defeat it except by being tough with it
and no serious ideas on the fun-
damental question of the Sino-Soviet
conflict and how to exploit it.
Goldwater has, moreover, made two
concrete proposals that give genuine
cause for alarm. The first is simply
te terminate the Russian-American
detente, and the second is to abolish
compulsory military training, “the
draft”. The detente, on his view,
that c ■ , tt • u ’
assumes that the Soviet Union has
radically changed and has abandoned
whereat i f °s r m7 rld Co T Umis h m ’
sS probit:
a
S fh? a/Tl ’ f and
with the missile gap. At this stage,
therefore a detente suits Russia but
nererore, a detente suits Russia but
in due course we can expect a streng-
thened Russia to resume its aggres-
sion against a softened-up free world.
To help Russia now, and even to trade
wheat with it, is literally suicidal.
A good deal of this is sound
enough. There is every reason to be
sceptical about the detente or to
demand greater concessions from
Russia in Berlin and Eastern Europe
as the price for it. But merely to
terminate it would, in the name of
being “tough with the Reds”, simply
represent a victory for the Chinese
Communists and intensify Soviet
control of the satellites. Closer to
home, it is also clear that any new
American confrontation with Russia
would involve the weakening of
American commitments in Asia and
provide Communist China with an
opportunity to expand south,

Behind both these policies, par-
ticularly when linked with Goldwater’s
economic protectionism, one can
detect the dream of Fortress America.
Goldwater’s is a nationalist religion
which despises rather than seriously
pl ans to undermine international Corn-
munism; and a Fortress America,
militarily invulnerable and economic-
allY protected, may well seem to many
Americans a better policy than
spilling American blood to save an
inferior world outside. But, from Aus-
tralia’s point of view, American
commitment to this “inferior” world
i s our life-line, and we have good
reason to fear that Senator Goldwater
i s a ll-too American for our security.
The "OZ" Trial
I ast week in Sydney his Worship,
J Mr. G. A. Locke, sentenced the
editors of the satirical magazine “Oz”
to six months’ hard labor and an
“Oz” artist to four months’ hard labor
for their offences against the NSW
Obscene Publications Act the
severest penalties imposed in Aus-
tralia for this sort of offence since
Dr Johnson was sentenced to two
years’ jail for publishing his obscene
magazine “The Satirist” in 1843.
The magistrate, acting under the
present NSW law, felt bound to
reject the evidence of a number of
academic, clerical and artistic wit-
nesses in defence of the editors. He,
not these witnesses, is of course the
judge of whether or not the Act has
been breached, but his judgment in
applying the Act indicates a great
gulf between the present law relating
to censorship and the intellectuals who
defended “Oz” a gulf which is
bound to lead to further violent dis-
putes unless it is bridged by an
amendment of the Act.


THIS AUSTRALIA
THE NAVY
Labor Wins the Great Debate
Cabinet takes over the RAN investigation
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
117'hatever soothing syrup Sir Robert
" Menzies may have been doling out
privately to calm some of his rattled
Ministers, the Prime Minister realised
that his Administration was in trouble
over the Navy censure debate last week.
He shifted his ground perceptively—and
Menzies, an old political campaigner,
does not shift ground when under direct
attack unless he feels he has to.
The shift came on the level of how
to carry out the investigation of RAN
communication procedures and of the
suitability of the current methods of
RAN selection, training and promotion.
In the previous week, when the report
of the Royal Commissioner, Sir John
Spicer, on the sinking of Captain Stevens’
Voyager came up for discussion, the
review of naval organisation and pro-
cedures which Menzies then announced
was to be conducted only at the second-
flight level. The Government, said Men-
zies, would “through a ministerial com-
mittee presided over by the Minister for
the Navy, the Chief of Staff being
associated with him, and with the pro-
fessional naval advice available to it,
closely and regularly consider ways and
means of reviewing naval organisation,
procedures and methods so as to make
improvements where these are found to
be desirable”.
But in the censure motion debate a
week later, under attack from an Opposi-
tion drawing its strength from events
(many of which seemed to speak for
themselves) rather than from theory,
Menzies superimposed on the second-
flight inquiry which, provided things
went smoothly in the RAN for any time,
could be lost sight of in the rush of day-
to-day events complete Cabinet re-
sponsibility. “This will be an investiga-
tion by Cabinet into the Navy,” Sir
Robert said. “It is the Government
which must satisfy itself whether any
changes are needed and must be made.
Cabinet itself will take the responsibility
for whatever decisions are made.”
But even in lifting of the investigation
from one chaired by the Navy Minister
(who is not in Cabinet) to Cabinet level
the Government took what in my view
was its worst beating in a Parliamentary
debate since 1954. It did not expect to
win. As I said last week, no semantics
could turn the Voyager sinking with its
tragic loss of life into a triumph of Aus-
tralian arms. But it did much worse
than it expected. Menzies himself was
not only below form, but, for the first
time in years, he appeared rattled. He
came perilously close to the line taken
in the previous week by Navy Minister
Chaney that RAN administration was
above criticism and that those who
criticised were either bounders, dis-
loyalists or completely lacking in intelli-
gence.
His final remark—that “mere publica-
CAPTAIN STEVENS
tion, with emphasis of these various
incidents (the mishaps in recent years in
the RAN) is calculated, and I suspect
deliberately calculated, to lower the
reputation of the RAN” was more
appropriate to a raw backbencher than
to a man of his long experience both as
a parliamentarian and an administrator.
How can parliamentarians, like him-
self, lacking technical knowledge of a
wide range of specialised subjects, pass
judgment upon the end-products of a
system, unless they examine the same
end products and decide whether or not
taken together they suggest a pattern of
happenings that merit either approbation
or disapproval? Menzies is not an
economist but he knows from the results
that his expert economists produce
whether he should accept the work they
are doing as satisfactory, or instruct
them to do it again.
The four Labor speakers—Opposition
Leader Mr Calwell, his deputy, Mr
Whitlam, Mr O’Connor (NSW) and Dr
Cairns (Vic.) insisted they were not
attacking the Navy or the men who
served in it, but doing their duty as an
Opposition by pointing to a succession
of incidents in the RAN which suggested
that the system on which the Navy was
operating, and under which the men
were serving, was not producing the
desired end results.
Although Deputy Prime Minister John
McEwen backed Menzies faithfully and
followed punctiliously the Menzies
theme that “there had been defects in
the RAN and always would be” with his
declaration that perfection could not be
achieved, he made it clear that he was
not going to make the same mistake as
Menzies in attributing some improper
motive to critics of Navy administration.
He began his speech by conceding the
right “indeed the duty” of the
Opposition to take the attitude it was
taking.
The significant list of Navy mishaps
over recent years helped the four Labor
speakers make their case, even conceding
that they marshalled their facts well, and
on the Government side quite a few
reputations have been dented, particu-
larly among the younger Ministers. So
it was with relief that the Government
saw the debate end.
It is a long time since the Government
has done quite as badly in a debate of
such major proportions.
BUSINESS
The Labor Squeeze
The Tariff Board Report
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
HTo rub in the message from Sir Colin
Syme, Chairman of Broken Hill Pro-
prietary that the company’s “cost of
labor has risen disproportionately to pro-
ductivity per man hour in consequence of
both national and State basic wage and
marginal increases and higher industry
rewards’’ the Tariff Board Chairman,
Mr G. A. Rattigan, warned of looming
dangers from the labor squeeze in his
Annual Report.
The Report appeared in a setting heav-
ily charged with Labor leaders’ demands
for Federal price control, a decision by


the ACTU to apply for another increase
in the basic wage, and employment fig-
ures showing there are 4000 more jobs
available than the overall total of un-
employed to fill them and an acute short-
age in almost every skilled trade.
Considering all this, the Report was
rather more restrained than might have
been expected in saying that the recent
evidence of upward trends in prices and
wages, the strong and growing pressures
of demand labor, together with the con-
tinuation of highly competitive conditions
in international trade have reinforced the
need for all sectors of industry to foster
improvements in productivity.
While the Board found little evidence
that industry had failed to keep abreast
of technological changes or to adapt up-
to-date labor and material-saving tech-
niques, productivity was adversely affec-
ted in some industries last year by not
paying sufficient attention to control over
costs, to the range and varieties of their
products, and to sales promotion and
methods of distribution. Others weakened
their position by increasing plant capacity
beyond the foreseeable requirements of
the market (and presumably, in some
cases, beyond the capacity of the labor
supply to operate them fully),
On labor costs, the Board finds that
costs of direct labor per unit of produc-
tion were generally higher in Australia
than overseas and that in some industries
the disabilities were large not only on
this score but also in overhead costs. On
the other hand, it has a good word to
say for the effect of wage incentive
schemes here in improving productivity.
If wage payments by some local manu-
facturers were higher than those of com-
petitors, their unit labor costs were “about
the same or lower because of greater
productivity per employee”. This speaks
well of local ability to compete with im-
ports, though in many industries the
margins are tight.
CENSORSHIP I
“Smut and Blasphemy”
" Salutary penalties ”
FROM ROBERT KLIMA IN SYDNEY
“Tt seems strange to have me sitting
here as a judge of public morality,”
said Central Court magistrate Mr G. A.
Locke, SM, during the hearing of
obscene publication charges over the
February issue of “Oz” magazine.
Nevertheless, he asserted his right to
reject expert evidence from moralists,
philosophers, psychiatrists and education-
ists last week to convict the magazine's
editors and cartoonist in one of Sydney’s
most dramatic confrontations of intel-
lectuals and the censorship law.
He gave “salutary penalties” of six
months’ gaol sentences to each of the
editors, Richard Neville and Richard
Walsh, and four months to the cartoonist,
Martin Sharp one of the severest
penalties ever imposed in Australian his-
tory for this sort of offence. He fined
Oz Publications Ink Ltd £lOO and Alfred
Francis James (honorary managing-
director of the Anglican Press) £5O.
Among the witnesses who had given
evidence in defence of “Oz” were:
Betty Archdale, headmistress of
Abbotsleigh School, Wahroonga, and a
member of the Sydney University Senate,
who said she would not recommend the
magazine because she thought it was
crude and unpleasant,, but she did not
think it would deprave or corrupt its
readers.
Geoffrey Latham Little, lecturer in
English literature at Sydney University,
who said “Oz” contained successful
satire and had literary merit.
Alexander Carey, lecturer in social
and applied psychology at the University
of New South Wales, who said the
magazine’s satire might make people
already headed for depravity stop and
think about it.
Gordon Hawkins, senior lecturer in
criminology at Sydney University, who
R. WALSH
R. NEVILLE
M. SHARP
B. ARCHDALE
had shown his 15-year-old daughter the
copy of “Oz”.
Dr James Graham Durham, senior
psychiatrist at the Rozelle Psychiatric
Clinic, who considered the magazine
would not deprave, corrupt or injure the
morals of readers' of any age, but could
have a salutary effect on the minds of
some young people.
Mr L. D. S. Waddy (for James) had
pointed out the lack of prosecution
witnesses to say the magazine was
obscene, but Mr Locke replied: “It’s not
a question of the number of witnesses—
it’s a question of what the Court thinks.”
The satire, which was praised by one
clergyman, Mr Locke described as “filthy
and disgusting”. He also found the
magazine indecent, smutty, blasphemous,
childish and grossly offensive. He found
an article on the Australian Security Ser-
vice an obscene libel.
As for defence evidence that “Oz”
would not tend to deprave: “Such
evidence runs contrary to life and is an
insult to the intelligence of this Court,”
he said. “Much has been said and
written on the need to curb the flow of
obscenity and pornography appearing in
the guise of literature. It is high time
publications of this stuff were stopped
in a manner which will show the law’s
determination to vindicate itself to those
who set themselves above it.”
Sharp and Walsh immediately lodged
appeals against their convictions and are
now on £lOO bail pending the hearing
of the appeals. Neville was in Noumea
when Mr Locke gave his finding, but
appealed as soon as he returned to
Sydney.
CENSORSHIP - II
Lady Cin Church
" Sandgroper ” revealed
FROM A PERTH CORRESPONDENT
T AST May, a columnist signed “Sand-
groper'’ sat down to write his
September piece, Candid Comments, for
The Congregationalist. His comments in
the church’s national publication have,
in the past, been equally candid. But
certainly none has attained such wide
distribution, for he attacked the banning
of “Lady Chatterley’s Lover” and the
centuries of inhibiting church teaching
that made such a ban so socially accept-
able.
The West Australian minister’s views
were picked up by Perth’s “Weekend
News” which gave them pre-publication
publicity on TV, and splashed on its
poster: Churchman Attacks Sex
Censors.
As a result, “Sandgroper” came out


of anonymity. He is 51-year-old the
Rev. Edwin White, newspaper and radio
commentator, a rebel Anglican.
He defended Lady C despite her lack
of literary merit, and despite erotic pas-
sages and the adultery. “Over-riding all
these considerations,” he wrote, “is the
fact that sex is a radiantly lovely,
liberating, and happy experience.
“We should do more for the health
of our society by attending to that situa-
tion than by indulging in silly censor-
ship. And when we ask how this sad
state of affairs has come about we
must admit that we are still in
the shadow of centuries of church teach-
ing that sex was essentially low and sin-
ful.
“We ought, moreover, to have enough
sense to see that all those novels, plays
and radio and television programmes
which pass the censor with no trouble
whatever, yet which associate sex with
tension, strife, and violence, are more
damaging than the lyrical eroticism of
“Lady Chatterley’s Lover”, and doubtless
of many another book banned in this
backward country.”
Discussing the reaction to his views,
Mr White said he went along with the
Bishop of Woolwich in comparing the
sex act with a form of holy communion.
“It is the deepest and fullest possible
integration of two people,” he maintains.
“When it is ordained of God it can be
to the glory of God.”
SECTS
The Scientologist with the Chignon
A trip to the Van Allen Belt
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
/\n its 110th day the Board of Inquiry
into Scientology heard for the
second time from Victoria’s most highly
qualified scientologist, a 26 - year - old
blonde with a chignon. The Inquiry was
continuing its examination of Mrs Pene-
lope Elizabeth Berncastel Williams. Mrs
Williams had already told the Inquiry
that Scientology could have prolonged
the life of a man dying from cancer by
increasing his “will to live”. She denied
that Scientology had promised the dead
man any cure.
During her evidence the two major
aspects of the Inquiry —its bizarre Alice-
in-Wonderland quality and its raising of
the mental and personal problems Scien-
tology has tried to tackle—were clearly
evident. Mrs Penelope Elizabeth Bern-
castel Williams is the wife of Mr Peter
Williams, the Continental Director for
Scientology’s operations in Australia,
New Zealand and Oceania. But Mrs Wil-
liams is HCO. This means that she is
secretary of the Hubbard Communica-
tions Office and the most senior channel
through which L. Ron Hubbard, the
founder of Scientology, communicates
with the faithful. Even her husband can-
not fire her. Mrs Williams has been to
England and reached class 6 in a special
course given by the master himself.
This was just one of the points raised
at the Inquiry which had already cost
more than four times the original esti-
mate of £5lOO. It was to have lasted for
28 days and to have finished by last
Easter. Then it was June. Then Septem-
ber. Now it looks as though it will be
October, with the Report ready just in
time for Christmas.
Cross-examined by Mr Gordon Just,
counsel assisting the Board, Mrs Wil-
liams seemed surprised to learn that L.
Ron Hubbard did not have the engineer-
ing degree he claimed from George
Washington University, or that the Ph.D.
he claimed to have received came from
Sequoia University which educational
authorities in the United States have been
unable to discover.
But Mrs Williams was not surprised
that L. Ron Hubbard had spent some
time recently up in the Van Allen Belt
above the atmosphere. He got there by
“exteriorising”. This is one of the many
new words and phrases which have be-
come the daily vocabulary of Mr Kevin
Anderson, QC, who is sitting at the
Board of Inquiry.
With it have come “implants” (of the
gorilla and plane door types), “Thetans”,
“clears and pre-clears”, “auditing”, “pro-
cessing” and “mocking up a mass”.
This latter idea was explained by Mrs
Williams. It was possible for someone to
lose or gain up to 30 pounds in weight
by “mocking up a mass”—that is, seeing
a picture of a cat which weighed 30
pounds. Mr Anderson pointed out it
would have to be a big cat.
This was one sort of evidence which
the Board has heard and which has pro-
vided an endless source of stories about
visits to other planets in previous exis-
tences, strolls through Indian bazaars
while the Board was sitting in Mel-
bourne’s Herbarium. A witness did this
simply by closing her eyes.
The other sort of evidence which came
during Mrs Williams’ appearance was on
the subject of Scientology and healing.
Mrs Williams denied that Scientologists
had entered this field. Mr Just read out
records of a Scientology course during
1959 and 1960 where a man suffering
from terminal cancer had undergone a
series of sessions in which he had to
reply to two statements repeated to him
at length for six hours a day on a num-
ber of occasions. “Think of the stomach
you would like to confront” and “think
of the stomach you would not like to
confront.”
The Chairman of Victoria’s Mental
Fiygiene Authority, Dr Cunningham Dax,
warned of the dangers of Scientology in
the field of mental health when he gave
evidence to the inquiry earlier this year.
On the 101st day, Mr Anderson said
that the pattern had been built up during
the evidence that “Scientology may well
be a great fraud”. This was “not by way
of a final view”, but the sort of “case
which had emerged”. He also voiced
concern about the seemingly intermin-
able length of the Inquiry and spoke of
the dangers of “sidetracking”.
With some 50 witnesses still to go, Vic-
torians may be sure of breaking the
three million word mark as the Inquiry
goes from the “Thetan” to “Thetan” and
from “clear” to “clear”.
TASMANIA
C P Collapse
To save the DLP?
FROM A LAUNCESTON CORRESPONDENT
Tasmanian headquarters of the
Country Party bluntly announced in
Launceston last week that it would not
endorse candidates for the Senate elec-
tion. Since a Senate seat had seemed the
principal object of the party, the abdica-
tion suggested that the organisation was
collapsing in the aftermath of crushing
defeat at the May State election and of
Executive disputes and friction.
The sights of its Federal Country Party
sponsors were undoubtedly set on the
Senate when they encouraged the re-
vival of the party in Tasmania nearly
two years ago some 40 years after an
early and unsuccessful effort to form a
viable organisation in the State. The dis-
tribution of population and the strong
agrarian element made Tasmania an
attractive target.
The fledgeling party entered the State
election campaign in the autumn with
high enthusiasm and higher hopes. The
hiding it got knocked a great deal of the
stuffing out of it.
Party spokesmen last week denied that
the election debacle had dried up the
source of candidates for the Senate. They
said that they had been “strongly advised”
by Federal headquarters to abandon their
plan of endorsing a team. The hint was

that headquarters had become solicitous
for Senator George Cole, now engaged in
a fight for survival as the DLP’s only
member in Canberra.
Certainly the surrender of the Country
Party will enhance Cole’s chances. The
ALP preferences in Tasmania would have
gone to the Country Party. In the pre-
vailing climate, Labor can be confident
of winning only two of the five Senate
places, and the party would undoubtedly
have preferred two Liberals and one
Country Party senator to two Liberals
and Cole.
Cole will pull a bigger vote than his
Party has secured at recent elections
in Tasmania, but his appeal lacks the
urgency it had six years ago when he
was the rebel. However, some Liberals
have spoken of “giving George my No.
1”, to keep the DLP in parliamentary
existence, and he is still a big and popu-
lar figure. One man can make his pres-
ence felt in Tasmania far more effectively
than in any of the larger States, as Dr
Turnbull proved when he won a Senate
seat as an Independent in 1961.
NEWCASTLE
Finding Out About
Finnan
"Water conies out here ”
FROM W. McCLUNG
F. FINNAN
VTo public figure ir. Newcastle had got
away to a worse start than Frank
Finnan. He had been a successful,
Parliamentarian as Tabor member for
Ilawkesbury and then Darlinghurst from
1941 till 1953. He had held the port-
folios of Tourist Activity and Labor and
Industry and Social Services and, during
the post-war years, was Prices Minister.
But Newcastle did not know him.
When the redistribution of boundaries
cost him his seat in Parliament, the in-
dustrial city and its rural background
were shocked to learn that a man who
had had no previous contact with the
district’s Water Board was to be its
Chief Administrator.
When Finnan opened the “Newcastle
Morning Herald” on his first Newcastle
day—April Fool's Day, 1953—he was
the central figure of the cartoon. A
laborer employee of the Water Board
was pointing to a tap and explaining to
him: “It comes out here.” He walked to
his new headquarters and found scrawled
across the footpath outside the Board
office “We don't want Finnan.”
Finnan did not know much about
water then and his instant success stem-
med from an admission of that weakness.
The first thing he did was offer to buy
the original of the “Herald” cartoon. It
was hanging in his office till he retired
this month.
No time was lost in calling the district-
wide protest meeting out, by the time it
was organised, the personality of Finnan
was beginning to break through the op-
position. A fortnight later everybody
knew that Finnan was in the post to stay.
He was soon leading his Board in dis-
cussions on how to satisfy the district’s
need for water in the year 2000. The
outcome of those discussions was the
opening on July 11 this year of the
£ll-million Grahamstown scheme a few
miles north of Newcastle. His name will
be perpetuated in Finnan Park, a de-
veloped tourist area on the shore of the
12-square-mile dam.
His big triumph came two years ago
when the State Parliament reversed its
unanimous decision pegging retiring ages
at 65. The two-year extension which it
granted him permitted him to complete
the direction of his major Grahamstown
project.
While he directed the affairs of one
of the State's biggest water undertakings*
Finnan found time to work in some of
the city’s biggest honorary jobs. He is
chairman of the Hunter Valley Research
Foundation and a member of Newcastle
Regional Development Committee, New-
castle International Sports Centre Trust,
the Mater Misericordiae Hospital Board,

RELIGION
Church Unity
Bishop Muldoon is not impressed
FROM GORDON CHESTERMAN IN SYDNEY
/Christian Unity plans have been at-
tacked again, this time by a group
of Presbyterian ministers and elders at
the General Assembly of tke Presbyterian
Church of Australia in Sydney recently.
But again the report of the Joint Com-
mission (comprising seven representatives
each from the Presbyterian, Congrega-
tional and Methodist Churches) was ac-
cepted by the majority for consideration
by church assemblies, presbyteries, ses-
sions and congregations.
The report recommends unity between
the Methodist, Presbyterian and Con-
gregational Churches in Australia, a con-
T. W. MULDOON
W. YOUNG
cordat with the Church of South India
and a system of bishops. Before the re-
port was accepted by the Presbyterians,
it had received support at the Assembly
of Congregational Churches (at its con-
ference in Brisbane in May this year)
and at the Methodist General Confer-
ence (in May 1963).
At the latest Presbyterian conference
a group of ministers and elders predict-
ed “contention, strife and division” in
the church over unity plans. In his
motion of dissent, the Rev. C. S. Petrie
(Ashfield) said the union proposals ex-
ceeded in their scope the authority given
by the Assembly to the reporting com-
mittee and adoption would mean viola-
tion of the church constitution. There
was, the Rev. Petrie said, a misconcep-
tion of the character of the true unity of
the Church as a spiritual entity and
undue importance was being given to
mere outward organisation. The sec-
tions on doctrinal standards were in-
adequate, defective and unduly limited,
while the creation of bishops and the
abolition of the Presbyterian eldership
were open to objection. At the end of
the meeting Mr Petrie said he would
send his criticisms to the new Moderator-
General of the Presbyterian Church, the
Rev. William Young.
But now that the three Protestant
Churches have considered the proposed
unity plan, it will be sent out for “further
thought” and possible amendments. Sub-
sequently the Joint Commission will
scrutinise the report before returning an
amended plan to the churches in 1966.
The amended plan will probably be
finally voted on in 1968.
Meanwhile the Auxiliary Bishop to
the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Syd-
ney (Cardinal Gilroy), Bishop T. W.
Muldoon, was not impressed by the
unity plan. Christian unity, he said, will
be a painful process requiring profound
humility and heroic charity. The Catholic
Church's idea of unity was not some
tea-party or a loose union of self-
governing or autonomous churches, he
said, but an organic unity in which all
members of the church hold one faith,
one essential worship and the people are
ruled by one form of Government. The
Roman Catholic Church could not com-
promise on those truths which it believes
to be divinely revealed.

THE DERBY
How to Pick the Winner
On October 3
FROM TIM WHIFFLER IN SYDNEY
J'Fhe problem of picking the winner of
the Derby at Randwick on Saturday,
October 3, is especially complex because
most, if not all, of the leading Derby
contenders have not been tried over the
distance and their stamina remains a
matter for speculation and trust until the
horses pass the winning post.
In England several theories have been
advanced to help predict whether a horse
will measure up to Derby class.
(1) Some theories resort to breeding to
help solve the problem—for example,
Michael Oakeshott in his “Guide to the
Classics”. He observed that the majority
of Derby winners were sired by horses
placed either in the Derby or St Leger.
This rule leads to a large number of
English Derby winners, e.g., Santa Claus,
who won this year’s Epsom Derby, is by
Chamossaire who won the St Leger.
It is inapplicable to Australian condi-
tions for two reasons:
(a) Winners of the AJC or VRC
Derby or VRC St. Leger are given few
chances at stud in Australia. In the
past, six AJC Derby winners, when given
the right opportunity at stud, have sired
a winner of that Derby. These were
Yattendon (won the Derby in 1864),
Robinson Crusoe (1867), Mountain King
(1907), Prince Foote (1909), Heroic
(1924) and Talking (1936). Of these,
Yattendon, Robinson Crusoe and Heroic
each produced two AJC Derby winners.
In the last decade, however, no promi-
nent AJC Derby candidate has been sired
by an AJC Derby winner.
(b) Only six placegetters in the
English Derby have been imported to
stand at stud in Australasia in the last
25 years. These include the winners
Midday Sun and Coronach and the
third placegetters, Le Grand Due, Light-
house 11, Pipe of Peace and Faubourg 11.
Lighthouse II was the only one to pro-
duce a Derby winner here, viz., Sailor’s
Guide (VRC Derby).
(2) Another method has been to resort
to taking measurements to define what
might be called “the Derby type”. An
English studmaster called Plesch has de-
vised such a procedure based on three
measurements: (i) the height (in hands);
(ii) the girth (in inches); (iii) the distance
from the hip bone to the top of the hock
(in inches).
These measurements are inter-related
by the following formula and the result
is called the Parabolic Index Measure-
ment.
height x 100,000 -y hip to hock = PIM
girth
The closer the PIM is to 500, the bet-
ter the horse is said to be. Plesch arrived
at this formula by examining placed
horses in the Derby. He found that the
winner was closer to 500 than the second
horse and the second horse closer than
the third.
It could be, however, that an un-
placed horse in the Derby has the lowest
PIM of all. In the 1953 AJC Derby field
the four horses with the lowest PIMs were

Royal Stream 506, Castillo 508, Prince
Morvi 516 and Silver Hawk 519. Prince
Morvi won the Derby but the other three
were unplaced. On the credit side, how-
ever, Royal Stream won the Chelmsford
Stakes as a three-year-old, Castillo the
QTC Derby and Silver Hawk the Rose-
hill Guineas.
The PIM therefore tells us more about
the quality of a three-year-old than about
who will win the Derby.
Here are presented the PIMs for the
leading candidates in next Saturday's
Derby:

Park Lane 16 72i” 42” 525
Bunyula 15.35 73” 41” 511
Royal Sovereign 16 733” 413” 525
Eskimo Prince 16 72” 423” 523
(3) The two theories presented so far
are of English origin and have no regard
to form. Form is very tricky in England
as there is only one semi-classic leading
up to the Derby, the 2000 Guineas over
a mile—a notoriously unreliable guide.
In Australia the situation is different be-
cause we have three semi-classics leading
up to the Derby—the Hobartville Stakes
(7 furlongs), the Canterbury Guineas
(started in 1936, over approx. 9 fur-
longs), the Rosehill Guineas (started in
1910—over 9 furlongs from 1915 to
1947 and 10 furlongs from 1948 on-
wards).
Of these the Hobartville Stakes offers
no guide. But form in the two Guineas
is very reliable—especially over the last
15 years when these two races have been
more popular with owners and trainers
than ever before.
Below are the four leading Derby
candidates with an analysis of their form
in the Guineas.
1. ESKIMO PRINCE (won Rosehill
Guineas by 5 lengths in 2.4 —which
equals the third fastest time in that race.
Previously ran second in the Canterbury
Guineas). Seven other horses have run
second in the Canterbury Guineas and
won the Rosehill Guineas. Of these
seven, the only one to win the AJC
Derby was Caranna who was also the
only one to win the Rosehill Guineas by
over two lengths. The winning margin
in the Rosehill Guineas is therefore im-
portant as it indicates the superiority of
the winner and how much energy reserve
he has for the extra Derby distance.
Seven horses have won the Rosehill
Guineas by three or more lengths: Nig-
ger Minstrel (1924), Phar Lap (1929),
Silver King (1934), Hall Stand (1942),
Caranna (1955), Tulloch (1957), and
Bogan Road (1962). Of these, Phar Lap,
Caranna and Tulloch won the AJC
Derby and the other four all ran second
in the classic. Eskimo Prince’s winning
margin in the Rosehill Guineas suggests
he should run first or second in the
Derby, and his form in the Canterbury
Guineas suggests a probable win.
2. STRAUSS (won the Canterbury
Guineas and second in Rosehill Guineas).
Five other horses had similar form and
all placed in the Derby. Three of them
won the Derby, Prince Morvi (1953),
Summer Prince (1962), Summer Fiesta
(1963). Strauss looks to be Eskimo
Prince’s main rival.
3. ROYAL SOVEREIGN (third in
both Guineas). Only Bourbon (1937)
and Knave (1955) had similar form and
were unplaced in the Derby. Care must
be taken in arriving at a conclusion on
two observations, so Royal Sovereign’s
form could be tricky and hard to assess.
As regards Strauss and Royal Sovereign,
no placegetter over four lengths in the
Rosehill Guineas has won the AJC
Derby.
4. PARK LANE was unplaced in both
Guineas and no horse with this form
has yet won the AJC Derby.


THE BROKEN HILL PROPRIETARY COMPANY LIMITED
CHAIRMAN'S ADDRESS
At the Annual General Meeting held at Essington
Lewis House , 500 Bourke Street , Melbourne , on
Friday, 18th September , 1964.
The reports and statements before you, which show the operating
and financial results of the Company and its subsidiaries in the year
under review, had been completed before the Federal Government
brought down its Budget for 1964-65. This provided for an increase
of sixpence in the pound in company income tax in respect of earn-
ings in 1963-64. The effect of this for the year under review is shown
in the sheet that has been inserted in the report, and amounted to
£115,000 in the case of the parent company and £720,000 for the
Group. It will be necessary to provide the additional amounts of tax
out of the appropriation accounts in the current year.
My comments which follow relate to the year’s figures as shown
in the accounts as printed before the additional tax was imposed.
The profit of the parent company amounted to £11.7 million
which represents an increase of £1 million or 9% over the previous
year.
Consolidated net profit, including that attributable to minority
interests, amounted to £18.3 million, and was £l.B million, or 11%
higher than in 1962-63. In arriving at this profit £28.7 million has
been provided for depreciation, and £11.6 million for income tax.
Provision for income tax is £2.1 million less than in the previous
year. There are two principal reasons for this. First, the tax saving
in respect of expenditure on Mining Plant and Development was some
£1,451,000 greater than in 1962-63. Secondly, the amount of capital
expenditure qualifying for investment allowance was £30.2 million in
1963-64 as compared with £22.8 million in 1962-63.
Consolidated profit before tax and depreciation rose by £1.5
million or 2.7%. The reason why profits have not kept pace with
production is that costs have increased at a rate beyond the gains
we have made in technological efficiency and through other avenues
of cost redxiction, even though these have been substantial. The
additional production has involved the provision of new plant at a
greatly increased cost per ton of installed capacity; raw material
costs have increased as we go further afield and absorb greater per-
centages of material which requires beneficiation; the cost of labour
has risen disproportionately to productivity per man hour in con-
sequence of both national and State basic wage and marginal increases
and higher industry awards; prices of tin and zinc have risen to high
figures. The tonnage of tin used in the manufacture of tinplate is
running at the rate cf about 2,200 tons per annum. Two years ago
the price of tin was £1,064 per ton; a year ago it was £1,131 per
ton and earlier this week it was £1,770. Had the current price applied
during the whole of 1963-64 our consolidated profit before tax would
have been reduced by at least £1 million.
During the year price adjustments (mainly upwards) were made
to a limited range of products but in the overall context these were
of a relatively minor nature. Recently we have felt it proper to warn
tinplate consumers that we may be compelled to increase the price
of tinplate early in 1965. We gave this long notice having in mind
the special circumstances of the tinplate consumers.
Shareholders will have noted an increase in the amount of interest
on debentures and fixed term loans as compared with the previous
year. In the main this is due to the fact that a full year’s interest
was not payable in the earlier year.
The liquid position of the Group is satisfactory. The Consolidated
Balance Sheet shows Current Assets of £l2l million as against Current
Liabilities and Provisions of £67 million, a ratio of 1.8 to 1. How-
ever these figures take no account of commitments amounting to £24
million in respect of contracts for capital expenditure as yet not
completed.
Investment in plant and equipment was almost £43 million in
the year under review and as usual a substantial proportion of this
expenditure was on work that is still in progress, and has not yet
become income earning.
EXPANSION AND DEVELOPMENT: We have now been involved in
major expansion for so long that sometimes the magnitude of the
continuing programme is not fully recognised. Over the past ten years
the Group has spent £309 million on capital works and of this
£205 million has been spent in the past five years. In the absence
of unforeseen circumstances it appears to your Board that expenditure
at least at this rate will need to continue. In the Managing Director’s
Report you will find a record of the many major plants brought into
use at various stages during the year and of others which are under
construction. Only some of these projects call for any further
comment.
The construction of the Whyalla steelworks is proceeding well.
The bringing into operation of major steel making at Whyalla next
year will occur in the fiftieth year after steel production commenced
at Newcastle. The Bloom Mill and Tonnage Oxygen Plant are
scheduled for completion within the next two months and the oxygen
steelmaking vessels will be put into commission early in 1965. A
second blast furnace is also under construction at Whyalla and it is
planned that this unit will be brought into operation about the
middle of next year. We are now adding some £3.8 million to the
cost of the structural mill to enable the rolling of wide flange sections.
These are structural shapes that are now finding many applications,
particularly in the construction of factories and mUlti-storey buildings.
When this equipment is installed it will increase the importance of
Whyalla as a centre for the supply of structural steel.
The new iron ore loading jetty being built at Whyalla and
scheduled for completion about mid 1965, will increase the efficiency
of loading and will cater for the 47,000 ton dead weight bulk carriers
which are to be built for use in the coastal iron ore trade. It was
announced recently by the Federal Minister for Shipping and Trans-
port that an order for the first two of four such vessels is to be
placed with our Company.
The new facilities at Koolan Island will be ready for operation
early in 1965, when we plan to obtain ironstone both from Cockatoo
Island and from Koolan Island.
In keeping with the Agreement which the Company entered into
with, the Government of Western Australia in 1960, detailed planning
has proceeded for the development of the Koolyanobbing iron ore
reserves and for the associated undertaking at Kwinana. This planning
is now at an advanced stage, and site work has commenced at both
places.
Field testing of the iron ore deposits at Koolyanobbing has been
completed and facilities are now being provided for the construction
and operating labour forces.
Inquiries were issued recently for the construction at Kwinana
of a modern blast furnace. The Company hopes that a high proportion
of the work for this development will be carried out in Western
Australia.
Additional dredging work in Cockburn Sound, also started recently,
is an important step towards the installation of a raw materials jetty
at Kwinana.
In Brisbane the new fence post plant and rod cut-up line are
nearing completion on a site immediately behind the Company’s
Wharf. The fence post plant will commence operations next month,
using bar supplied from Newcastle. By the end of the year, the
rod cut-up line will be producing cut to length rods for local
reinforcing bar needs.
The Geelong works of our subsidiary, Rylands Bros. (Aust.) Pty.
Ltd. are being extended to include a wire rope plant and equipment
for drawing high carbon wires.
PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS: The substantial increases in
general steel production recorded in the year untier review reflect the
heavy investment in expansion and replacement of facilities over
recent years. The output of coke and pig iron rose significantly, and
ingot production at 4.7 million tons was 490,000 tons, or 11.5%, above
the record level of the previous year. Ingot production rose at all
centres and the increase at Newcastle was particularly gratifying
reflecting the improving operation of the basic oxygen steel making
plant.
The output of finished steel products rose in line with the
increase in ingot production.
Continued on opposite page.


Despite the substantial increase in production we are not able
currently to fully meet market demands for our products. This is in
marked contrast to the position which prevailed in some recent years
when production and employment were maintained only by virtue of
substantial export sales. The steel industry is prone to these marked
fluctuations in demand, the extent of which cannot be fully
anticipated.
Since a period of years needs to elapse between the planning of
any major producing units and the bringing of these units into
operation, this difficulty in estimating future demand makes it almost
impossible to maintain a balance between supply and demand as a
continuing state of affairs. In this connection it is interesting to
recall that in 1958 there was some public discussion as to the rate
at which the Australian steel industry was planning to expand. The
Department of Trade then estimated that an ingot capacity of 4.7
million tons per annum in 1965 would scarcely be in excess of
Australia’s potential requirements. In making this estimate the
Department allowed for a substantial export component as being part
of Australia’s requirements. The estimate accorded fairly well with
the views of our own officers. Yet the report before you shows that
in 1963-64 over a year in advance of 1965 —we produced more than
4.7 million ingot tons and in the latter part of the year we could not
fully meet the home demand, let alone provide a reasonable tonnage
for export.
This comment is not intended to be a criticism of the estimates
of the Department of Trade or of our own officers in the long run
they may well be right. But it does illustrate the difficulty of
estimating steel demand on a year by year basis.
RAW MATERIALS: The output of iron ore, coal and other raw
materials has been maintained at rates adequate for our requirements.
Coal production without including Corrimal Colliery was a record, and
was 7% above the level of the previous year. This increase resulted
from the technological improvements and extensive developmental
work undertaken in our Collieries, particularly in regard to materials
handling.
During the year Australian Iron & Steel Pty. Ltd. purchased the
whole of the share capital of Corrimal Coal Pty. Limited and Corrimal
Coke Pty. Limited. The Coal Company’s holding adjoins our Kernira
Colliery on the southern coalfields of N.S.W., and its purchase makes
a valuable addition to the Company’s reserves of coking coal.
Another development planned on the southern coalfields is the
installation of long-wall equipment at Kernira Colliery. This equip-
ment should be in operation in 1965, and is part of the continual
development needed to keep pace with coke making requirements at
the Port Kembla steelworks. In this regard it was announced recently
that an additional battery of coke ovens is to be built at Port Kembla
at a capital cost of approximately £11.9 million. This installation
is planned to be complete during the latter part of 1966.
Exploration for raw materials has continued over widely spread
areas in Australia, and further success has resulted, notably in respect
to manganese ore.
At Groote Eylandt, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, significant deposits
of manganese ore have been tested and they are so located that the
ore is procurable at a reasonable cost as compared with ore from other
sources. These deposits comprise varying physical and chemical grades
from which a satisfactory feed will be available for the ferro-manganese
furnace at Bell Bay, Tasmania, operated by our subsidiary, Tasmanian
Electro Metallurgical Co. Pty. Ltd. As Groote Eylandt is an aboriginal
reservation in the Northern Territory, consultations have been held
with the local aborigines and the Church Missionary Society, which
has two established missions on the island. Concurrently negotiations
took place with the Administration of the Northern Territory for
Special Mineral Leases over areas already investigated. These leases
are expected to be issued shortly so that quarry plant, roads, transport,
shiploading facilities involving a jetty, and » small township can be
established. We feel that this undertaking at Groote Eylandt will
be of some significance in the development of the northern parts of
Australia and we are pleased that our Company is able to contribute
in this further way to that development. The outlay in facilities
required for the winning and shipping of ore is estimated to be
approximately £2 m-flUon.,
Investigation of the iron ore deposits held as Temporary Reserves
in the Pilbara and Ashburton regions of Western Australia continues.
In addition to the assessment of ore reserves and grade, blasting,
crushing and metallurgical tests have been in progress. Hydrographic
and land surveys to locate the most suitable port site and railroad
access to the coast respectively are continuing. There is no doubt that
the solution of the transport problem will be costly. The ore itself
is limonitic that is to say, it contains more moisture and less iron
than the hematite ores to which we are accustomed.
Investigation of quartzite at Beaconsfield, Tasmania, has shown that
the material is satisfactory for the production of ferro-silicon and
silico-manganese, and mining title to the area has been obtained and
production from the deposit commenced.
As part of our general prospecting campaign a notice of intention
to make an application for an Exploration Licence was lodged by
the Company with the Mines Department in Hobart in July, 1964.
The application will cover an area of approximately 6,000 square miles
in the south-west quadrant of Tasmania, and will protect the Com*
pany’s interests while the prospects of the area are assessed.
Preliminary work in relation to the development of Coffin Bay
lime sand deposits in South Australia has been started. This project
scheduled for completion about May, 1966, involves the provision of
facilities for winning the lime sands and the construction of a 23-
mile railway from Coffin Bay to Port Lincoln where storage facilities
as well as a jetty and ship loading plant are to be installed.
Haematite Explorations Pty. Ltd., our subsidiary company engaged
in the search for petroleum, completed a marine seismic survey of
the offshore areas held under title from the States of Victoria,
Tasmania and South Australia. This survey qualified for subsidy
under the Commonwealth Petroleum Search Subsidy Act. The
investigation has proved the existence of three large sedimentary
basins, which are known as Gippsland, Bass and Otway, and an agree-
ment was made with Esso Exploration Australia Inc., a fully owned
subsidiary of Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, for the exploration
and exploitation of the Gippsland Basin. Offshore drilling is scheduled
to commence in December next. Evaluation of the Bass and Otway
basins is continuing.
FUTURE EXPANSION: In conjunction with its senior officers
your Board is currently conducting one of its periodic reviews of the
future expansion programme and its likely financial implications. The
review indicates that capital expenditure within , the next two years
will cause our liquid resources to drop to a lower figure than your
Board would regard as adequate for an enterprise of our size. A
forecast of this nature necessarily makes many assumptions and
one of the important assumptions is that labour and material
shortages will not cause any appreciable interruption in our pro-
gramme. If the assumptions turn out to be correct, the possibility
exists that the Board will need to consider during 1965 or soon after-
wards the raising of further capital. Despite the qualifications to
which I have referred, we feel it proper that shareholders should be
advised of this possibility since the report before you might reason-
ably cause you to believe that fresh capital is unlikely to be required
for some considerable time.
We think that you should also know that the Board’s present
view is that the next raising of capital should be by means of a
share issue unless there is some marked change in circumstances.
The state of increased production and increased demand which
has applied generally to the steel industry has also applied to our
wire making subsidiaries which have found a ready market for their
output. Similarly, the demand for products of Commonwealth Steel
Co. Ltd. was at a higher level but the Company’s stainless steel sheet
mill at Unanderra is operating somewhat below capacity due to
competition from imports.
The value of export steel deliveries in 1963-64 was somewhat
greater than the corresponding figure for the previous year but most
of these export deliveries took place in the early part of the year and
resulted from contracts made some time earlier. As mentioned in
the Directors’ Report the domestic market situation has caused us to
restrict export sales (other than to New Zealand) to token tonnages
and this was particularly so during the latter part of the year. Despite
this situation regular contact is being maintained with the markets
which have been developed. Whilst there has been an increase in
world-wide steel demand there has also been a substantial increase
in productive capacity in many countries and consequently export
prices have shown little improvement.
During the past year the shortage of labour in Australia has
caused us increasing concern, particularly in relation to Whyalla and
Port Kembla. In an endeavour to ease the position we decided to send
officers to the United Kingdom to conduct a recruiting campaign for
tradesmen and unskilled labour. This operation is being undertaken
in close collaboration with the Departments of Immigration and
Labour and National Service. I am pleased to say that results are
quite encouraging. As at the end of August, 1964, 347 tradesmen and
238 unskilled men have accepted employment at Whyalla, and 244
tradesmen and 1382 unskilled men have accepted employment at
Newcastle and Port Kembla. It remains to be seen whether all these
men come to Australia but they are coming forward in encouraging
numbers and the recruitment is continuing. At Newcastle and else-
where we have been encountering some industrial stoppages of the
kind which are commonly associated with labour shortages.
In addition to recruiting tradesmen overseas, the Company has
steadily increased the number of trade apprentices under training to
2,200. The intake of apprentices this year was 650. To provide
adequate training facilities for our apprentices we have spent over
£500,000 in recent years in building and equipping specially designed
training shops at our various centres. At the same time the policy
of training young men and women to meet future professional and
technical staff needs has continued, and over 1,400 young people in
these categories are under training. In addition, close attention
continues to be given to operator and supervisor training and to
other phases of the development of Company staff.
Resulting from the introduction by the Company in 1956 of
Australian Steel Industry Scholarships which are tenable at any Aus-
tralian university, 221 such scholarships have been awarded to date
to either undergraduates or students at matriculation level, 77 of
these scholarships are still current.
For several years we have been providing training facilities for a
number of Asian students from such countries as Hong Kong, India,
Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan, and we believe this makes a tangible
contribution to better understanding between Australia and its near
neighbours to the North.


Ten Gold Medals from Tokyo?
But more wooden spoons than ever
By DISCUS
Now is the winter of our discontent.
After a summer of lavish promises
it has become evident that Austra-
lia’s 290 Olympians are unlikely to match
the confidence of their publicists in those
warmer days. During the Northern Hemi-
sphere summer the record books have
been rewritten by the Olympians of many
nations, while our men and women have
failed to improve during their winter or
pre-Olympian training period. They go
to Tokyo and the 18th Olympiad with
little more than their courage to support
them.
Several months ago I said we had no
gold medal certainties, not excepting Ron
Clarke and Dawn Fraser. This was in
distinct contradiction to the glowing esti-
mates of those whose business it was to
create public enthusiasm and swell the
Olympic Fund. After our swimmers’ and
athletes’ final preparations had concluded,
with nothing better than one world record
in yards, not metres, it became very
clear that, if our competitors are going
to win medals, they will do it on heart
alone.
Fortunately this is something which
occasional individual Australian competi-
tors have, and it has won more medals
for our Olympic teams than all the large-
ly imaginary benefits of coaching, unique
training methods, and sheer brilliance.
The tradition began with Edwin Flack at
the 1896 Games and has continued in
such people as Beaurepaire, Charlton,
O’Neill, Landy, Cuthbert, Fraser, Elliott,
Rose, to name a few over the years.
This, more than any other considera-
tion, is the reason we should feel ashamed
that outdated ideas in the minds of
well-meaning but outdated men has kept
Murray Rose out of the swimming team.
It is not long since a brush with another
side of “authority” could have kept Dawn
Fraser out of the swim. Somewhere in
sport there has to be a balance between
official control and the competitor’s indi-
vidual value, not to mention rights.
Amateur officials have something too
close to absolute power and there is a
saying about that.
Rose is out. Dawn Fraser has re-
mained in. On heart, Dawn has a good
chance to win a gold medal at her
third Olympics and make history. Among
the rest of the swimmers, Bob Windle
and Peter Phelps strike me as youngsters
who will rise to an occasion, with Gillian
de Greenlaw among the women. Three
medal chances despite their lack of form.
Tn track and field events, Tony Sneaz-
A well could come up trumps in the ten-
sion of a high jump final, although he
is overshadowed by Russian and
American jumpers on performance so
far. Helen Frith, Betty Cuthbert and
Dixie Willis seem the best chances for
medal-snatching from runners with better
times. Noel Freeman is a possible and
Tony Cook should win a bronze or silver
medal. In track, tactics are as important
as world times.
Cycling offers one individual chance
in Gordon Johnson, who is a young,
powerful sprint rider without sufficient
experience against the world's best.
Cycling is one sport in which heart alone
cannot match experience, but Johnson
is a quick learner and has a chance if
he survives the opening competition.
There is one hope in boxing, a feather-
weight with signs of class, but the man
with heart is light-heavyweight Fred
Casey. Overshadowed for years by
Madigan, this Casey has never stopped
trying and his improvement rather than
Madigan's age seems to have been the
deciding factor in their recent matches.
Casey is now strong enough, heavy
enough and still young enough to sur-
prise.
Of all the Olympic events, the ones
calling for the commodity under dis-
cussion—heart—are the marathon, pen-
tathlon and decathlon. And if any Aus-
tralians deserve a medal for upholding
the better Olympic traditions, these are
Macken, McMiken, Page and Mitchelson,
our modern pentathlon team, who actual-
ly worked their way overseas ai.d back
to gain competition experience for this
Olympiad. Macken has some hope of a
medal, as an individual competitor.
So much for my estimate of individual
performers’ medal chances. In Rome
we won eight gold, eight silver and six
bronze medals, and the equestrians won
four of the gold medals. We will be very
lucky to do as well in Tokyo. I have
guessed at 13 medal possibilities, and to
that list I would add the hockey team

Twenty medals in Rome, probably six-
teen or seventeen in Tokyo, from a team

In the immortal words of the father of
the modern Olympics, the Baron de
Coubertin, the ideal is to compete, not
necessarily to win. Per capita, Australia
will establish an all-time Olympic record
for sending the most competitors with
the least chance of winning more than
wooden spoons. With public and com-
mercial support to the tune of £160,000
we will have proved ourselves the world’s
greatest sports nation, within the con-
text of the Baron’s ideal.
That rosiest of optimists, the Olympic
Fund’s PR man, has guessed that Austra-
lia could win about 50 medals, including
10 gold ones. Averaging the cost at
£3OOO for each bronze to gold medal,
some picayune characters may be justi-
fied in feeling that £lOO,OOO of the
money could have been collected and
spent more creditably on overseas trips
for 100 scientists, squash champions,
writers, television directors, actors, dan-
cers and singers, useful people whose
travels might bring a more lasting re-
nown to Australia. But fortunately
such sourpusses are few.
Expert alms gathering
Qo, with little opposition, the amateur
sports officials made a preliminary
estimate that 200 or so would be going to
Tokyo, which was 100 too many but still
a reasonable figure based on our repre-
sentation in Rome. Then the amateurs
began a campaign that in one sense
shames me for ever having suggested
that they did not know how to promote.
Carnivals and meets they cannot pro-
mote, but at gathering alms from an
easygoing public they have proved
expert.
Doing it the easy way, they promoted
commercial support from a number of
“official sponsors of the Olympic Games
team”, a tag which politely belittled the
fact that thousands of us contributed
our shillings and pounds as “official
sponsors” too. A Sydney television
station made fund-raising easy by hold-
ing a 24-hour “telethon” which raised
most of the NSW quota. And these
procedures were accompanied by a great
ballyhoo over the few world, British
Commonwealth and national records that
our potential competitors managed to
break in the summer. That all the
northern nations still had their summer
to go was ignored. We were the great-
est.
In their use of 1964 publicity methods
the amateurs were very modern. In
most other ways, from the times for
choosing the individual teams to the
simple matter of arranging visas, they
might have been back in 1896.
Several weeks ago I said, and since
then other more authoritative people
have said it too, that it is strictly horse-
and-buggy to select Australian teams on
March performances for the Northern
Hemisphere Olympiads which must occur
in October and November, and which
must be in the majority for many years.
This principle of selection is a relic of
“we’re isolated, at the bottom of the
world” thinking.
It may be difficult, but would be sen-
sible, for the amateurs to realise that in
an Olympic year, with a climate so tem-
perate in winter that many nations would
call it high summer, our training and
competition could continue through the
12 months before the Olympiad, with
carnivals in Sydney and Brisbane during
the coldest period.
This would not be gaining an unfair

125 Flinders Lane, Melbourne
A Keith Courtenay keeps its crisp new look longer than any other suit
advantage. The northern nations have
all summer to train for the Games. Our
potential Olympians reach their peak for
the end of summer championships and
then train lightly during our winter and
have a final few weeks to scurry back
into form. A few of the best are in-
vited to compete overseas during our
winter.
The winter Olympics give us this
timetable in reverse. They are held in
Europe at the end of winter and mostly
the events are won by nations with cold
climates and year-round snow. There
is no reason why we should not turn our
climate to our advantage in the other
Olympic sports.
It would require an entirely new
approach to the amateur sports by their
officials, those who compete, and those
willing to support. Instead of doing
little for three years and then holding a
corroboree during the Commonwealth
Games and Olympic years the amateurs
should be promoting their interests by
genuinely competing for the public’s
money every year, just as tennis and
rugby do, and in other countries hockey,
ice hockey, boxing, wrestling, judo and
many other sports do.
How else can our do-nothing control-
lers of amateur sport explain why other
countries can afford to invite our top
amateurs to compete at their carnivals
while we cannot spare money out of
amateur funds to import anyone of
ability to compete at our meets? The
best we can do is hold sad, shoestring
carnivals every blue moon, at which a
handful of people may see a world
record made or new champions emerge
into the spotlight of neglect.
“Politics’’
world’s amateur sports have some
vital decisions to make. Australia
must be involved in these, and the deci-
sions to be made locally will affect the
entire face of amateur sport. One prob-
lem, defined by the chancellor of the In-
ternational Olympic Committee, Otto
Mayer, as “politics”, also includes the
matter of national pride overriding true
sporting attitudes.
Each Olympiad develops into a greater
slugging match between the USA and the
USSR, but Australia is also guilty of
“politics” in sending a disproportionate
290 to the 18th Olympiad. By 1968
many more countries will be ready to
compete on a larger scale and, if they
follow our example and send nearly
everyone, there will be 12,000 competing
and then 16,000 and 20,000, until few
nations will be able to afford an
Olympiad.
The next question Otto Mayer raised,
in an eve of retirement article in the
British magazine “World Sport”, was
that of amateurism and shamateurism.

Dairy Pipeline
to Asia
The role of Australia as “milkman” to Asia is a fascinating one
. . . condensed milk to Burma, powdered milk to the Philippines,
Singapore and Thailand, butter and cheese to South America,
Malaya, Hong Kong and Ceylon, cheese to Japan—these are
accomplished facts. That we have a future market in Asia
which could strain the expansion resources of the Dairying
Industry is no mere pipe dream. And, apart from the challenge
this presents, there is perhaps a humanitarian consideration
involved as well.
Australia’s gigantic Dairying Industry is a highly efficient one . . .
a complex of good pastures and herds, processing plants equal
to anything in the world, a far-sighted marketing direction.
Annual output is 1,500 million gallons of whole milk, 200,000
tons of butter, 56,000 tons of cheese. Exports of dairy foods
stand at £44 million and the potential for expansion is enormous.
Whilst Australians and New Zealanders consume 1,100 lb. of
dairy food per head per year, and Europe and North America
700 to 800 lb., the South-East Asian average is below 80 lb.
It is estimated that an increase in consumption to only 80 lb.
would create a demand that we couldn’t hope to meet for years
to come. An increase to the level of Europe would create a
serious world shortage.
Australia is initiating the establishment of milk processing
plants in various Asian countries to re-constitute our powdered
milk. One of these now operates in the Philippines and others
at Singapore and Bangkok are well under way. The most
spectacular advance to date has been to Japan—shipments of
cheese in 1957-58 totalled 40 tons. 1964 has brought this to
2,500 tons. In 1965 it should be 5,000 tons.
Balance this activity against the fact that our present exportable
surplus of dairy food is sufficient only for the needs of a little
under three million Australians, and that it is estimated that
our population will rise by 21 million in the next ten years.
It then becomes apparent that in this period a substantial
production increase will be necessary. Since dairy pastures
account for 25% of all irrigated land in Australia, future dairy
production will need a heavy irrigation expansion . . . water
development will set the pace of progress.

This will be complicated if tennis goes
into the 1968 Games. But even now
the definition of “amateur” is very fuzzy.
There are “political amateurs” and “com-
mercial amateurs”. We are very strict
about the prizes that can be won by an
amateur, but are not expenses and trips
abroad between Games forms of prizes?
Our amateur sports are beginning to
accept help from commerce, against the
concepts held by such men as Otto
Mayer.
This becomes a more difficult problem
under closer examination. If the Austra-
lian sports accept commerce’s backing, as
in the underwriting of the Pakistani
hockey team's recent warm-up visit, but
draw the line there, they are still making
tours and expenses possible for other
nations’ athletes. Commercial money is
helping to bring coaches here. So the
amateurs are still involved.
If they do not wish to be, they will
have to learn to promote carnivals and
meets and make their own money, or
else Australia’s Olympians will win fewer
and fewer medals, even if we send 1000
to the Games. And the course which
Australia decides to follow must affect
world Olympic ideals to some extent.
Spend more, train fewer
fFHESE are a few of the issues that will
■“ be touched on, perhaps decided, in
the official contacts occurring during the
Tokyo Olympiad. In the present con-
text, the discussions behind the Games
could be more important than all the
events in the arenas. Otto Mayer says:
“The festival has become too vast and
the true qualities of amateur sportsmen
are no longer evident.” Others have
different opinions. Who prevails will
decide whether the 1968 Olympiad is
more so or less so than this one.
It does not matter much how many
medals we do or do not win, this year.
In the backward state of most Australian
amateur sport, with too few expert
coaches, a mixture of look-forward and
look-back officials, and too little imagi-
nation, money and international com-
petition, the Australians who do win
medals will deserve great praise, not for
their brilliance but because they have
won on heart.
Next time we should give them more
to support that quality. More should be
spent to train fewer in the Olympic year.
Entry to the Olympic team should be
as difficult as a rich man’s passage to
heaven, but the opportunity to achieve
it should be extended by raising money
over four years, not one, and spending
it on more coaching and more competi-
tion for more young athletes. I believe
this would be in much greater accord
with Olympic ideals than our current
spending of £160,000 for very little gain
to the nation.

BUSINESS
A Man of Influence
Sydney sustained one of the strongest British invasions since 1788 this
week when the British Exhibition began. We talked to six visitors who
represent the Best of Britain in business, beauty, music and food.
air-conditioned atmosphere was
A formal but decidedly friendly. Clive
Latham Baillieu, the first Baron of Sef-
ton in Victoria, and Parkwood in Surrey,
was adjusting a red carnation in the
buttonhole of his dinner jacket when I
arrived at his Australia Hotel suite in
Sydney to wish him a happy birthday.
It was difficult to believe that Lord
Baillieu is now 75. Tall, still slim, wiry
and wry, he look nearly 20 years young-
er. “I have always been blessed with ex-
cellent health,” he said.
Arranging a convenient time to talk
with Lord Baillieu had not been easy.
These few minutes while he was relax-
ing after having changed for dinner were
the only ones his Lordship had had to
spare all day. “People have been very
nice, but they don’t seem to realise how
busy I am most of the time”, he said.
He at first pooh-poohed the notion
that he is one of the most influential men
in the world. “I think that’s going a bit
far. Of course, it all depends how in-
fluence is measured, doesn’t it? If it
means as I think it should the
amount of sway one has with important
contacts around the globe then I sup-
pose I do have a lot of influence here and
there.” He agreed that “the most influen-
tial Australian abroad” might be a more
accurate description. “I am still Aus-
tralian, remember. I return to this coun-
try nearly every year. It is only six
months since I last was here. I don’t
seek publicity so sometimes I manage
to slip in and out without being noticed
by the Press. Whenever they do get me,
though, I try to tell them whatever it
is they want to know. I talk to them
but I never ask them to come and talk
to me”.
Asked about his control of finance, at
home and abroad, Lord Baillieu crossed
one fashionably - tapered midnight - blue
trouser leg deftly over the other and
said: “Everyone thinks I control more
than I do. I am a director of the ES & A
Bank and yes the Midland Bank,
but I really offer only advice, you know.
My mining interests have given me a
different sort of field of influence. Any
personal control 1 could be said to exert
over international finance would be
through that.”
Smiling over a question about what he
considers the main achievements of his
75 years, Lord Baillieu said he would
need more than ten minutes to think
about that.
“Perhaps if I were to mention my
happiest achievement, though. It has
been my work with Dunlop”. (He was
elected deputy chairman of the Dunlop
Rubber Company Ltd in 1945, chair-
man in 1949 and president in 1957.)
“Now that they’ve kicked me upstairs
and made me president of the company
I find I have more time to see all my old
friends in the organisation. We have
more than 100,000 employees through-
out the world, you know. I have been
with Dunlop for 37 years now. I regard
it as my happiest association, profes-
sionally, and my present position as pre-
sident is an achievement I certainly en-
joy”.
In passing, he mentioned his work on
the Imperial Economic Committee (1930-
47) and as Her Majesty’s Government
representative on the Australian Im-
perial Communications Advisory Com-
mittee (1929-39) as jobs that also had
happy memories. “We got them to com-
bine cables and wireless. I think that
was important”, he said. Now in Aus-
tralia “to help guide the interests of
both Britain and Australia equally”, he
has found time to walk around the
British Exhibition alone at the Sydney
Showground “to make sure I know where
everything is”. He said it is the best
British Exhibition he has ever seen and
this was marvellously reassuring as he

Why did Hanimex add
that T to Praktica IV?
For Fresnal, firstly.
That’s the name of the optical genius responsible for
the latest modifications to Praktica. The same sort of
genius that has developed German automobiles to their
present stage of perfection. Mr. ‘F’ has invented a
new kind of grooved screen view-finder. When you use
it, you’ll see how it concentrates all of the available
light to give a much brighter, sharper picture.
We could have called it a IVFF, actually, because we’ve
also added a new fingertip controlled split-image
range-finder.
This gives the Praktica IVF two new features:
(1) Fresnal screen view-finder.
(2) Fingertip controlled split-image range-finder.
Add these to the excellence of the Praktica IV and to
its fully automatic lenses, its most flexible range of
accessories, its fantastic Hanimex world-wide warranty,
and the finest of service ... and this justly famous
35 mm. camera is worth more than an initial ‘F.’
The Praktica is a single lens reflex camera with fully
interchangeable lenses. Praktica offers these features
at only a little more cost than simple range-finder
cameras.
Here are the three models:
Praktica IVF with Meyer Domiplan Lens.
This quality f2.8/50 mm. 4-element automatic lens is
hard coated and colour corrected. The automatic dia-
phragm opens and closes as the shutter is released
and the film transported to the next frame. Price . . .
£39/19/6.
Praktica IVF with Zeiss Tessar Lens.
This famous f2.8/50 mm. lens is fitted with a depth of
field preview button and fully automatic diaphragm.
Price . . . £49/19/6.
Praktica IVF with Zeiss Pancolor Lens.
This 6-element f2/58 mm. lens is the finest of its type
in the world—has every modern optical innovation
incorporated, to give the maximum results under all
light conditions. Price . . . £59/19/6.
Praktica offers you the largest range of interchangeable
lenses and accessories in the world. It’s worth a fast
trip to your friendly photographic dealer, who will tell
you a lot more about Praktica and demonstrate every
outstanding feature.
Or, if you prefer, write Hanimex for free literature.
The highly informative handbook, “Praktica System of
Photography," is also available from Hanimex dealers
at 39/6.

had a particular interest in the work of
its organiser, Sir Norman Kipping.
Here Lord Baillieu’s secretary, Miss
Watson, entered in evening dress to
remind him that it was time to leave. “I
have worked for Lord Baillieu for many,
many years. He is a rare man—and a
real man,” she said. His Lordship
pooh-poohed that, too. “I was talking
about Norman Kipping,” he said. “Now
there’s a brilliant fellow. I personally
chose him for the job of president of
the Federated British Industries. I
couldn’t be more pleased with the result
in Sydney today” . . . The Baillieu in-
fluence had again been happily vindi-

would. An hour and several distracted
phone calls after the original time for
meeting, Carole Redhead, Miss Great
Britain for 1964, was ready to receive
me in her hotel suite. She was ex-
hausted, washed up, she had been shak-
ing too many hands, she could only allow
a few minutes. Predictably, she turned
out to be sulky, royal, languishing
yellow-skirted on a bed, painting her
nails with a look at them of icy dis-
taste; unpredictably, she looked fresh,
smooth, a long way from her announced
exhaustion.
“I'll talk to you when I’ve finished
my nails,” she said expressionlessly.
Obediently, I was silent. Several minutes
passed as she moved from her left hand
to her right. At last the task was done.
She surveyed her handiwork. “I was
chosen Miss Great Britain at Morecambe
Baths,” she said, without pride. “The
judges were the Bachelors, a soldier out
of the ranks and a man from your Aus-
tralia House. And the famous comedian
Steve Stennett.” Who? “S-T-E-N-
N-E-T-T. You should be ashamed.
“I was judged on face, figure, deport-
ment, posture, personality and groom-

imitated me by wearing lace but I was
the only one who always wore red. Red.
Nobody else did that. But I wasn’t
chosen for the prize only because I wore
red, I need hardly add.
“I won £lOOO, a £5OO waterproof dia-

case, a trip round the British Isles and a

beauty competitions girls are catty if
you’re better-looking than they are. In-
side, they aren’t catty at all and I don’t
care what the papers say. You see,
they’re as pretty as you are inside the
beauty world; well, nearly, anyway. So
there isn’t the same amount of jealousy.”
So the motive hadn’t been fame,
money, the Big Time, a chance at film
stardom? “On no,” Miss Great Britain
said with contempt. “Eve seen a film
being made. I don’t want that as a full-
time thing.” What film? “Carry. On,
Cleo’.” It seemed advisable to change the
subject, but she ran on. “It really wasn’t
as glamorous as everyone says. It’s a very
false type of world. Cardboard, really.
You have to do every little scene 20
times. Of course if anyone asked me,
but I’m not going begging . . .” She had
been billed in England as a bathing
beauty, a TV show had had her in a
“day in the life” of one, and I asked her
if she could swim. She looked at me
sharply. “You can sun bathe, can't you?”
And what was she doing here? She would
be appearing at premieres, talking to
people at the British Exhibition grounds,
and modelling jewellery. “I’m sorry to
interrupt, darling, but you won’t be
modelling jewellery at all”, a publicity
woman, who had arrived in mid-conver-
sation, said sharply. “But that’s what
they told me to say,” Miss Great Britain
said coldly. “Well, whatever they said,
you won’t be,” was the reply. Suddenly
Miss Redhead remembered it was time
for her bath. She looked at her prize
watch. “You wouldn’t like me to strip
right down here with both of you in
the room, would you?” She laughed to
herself as we took our leave.

FOOD
Extra Grouse
Scottish foods made by W. A.
A Baxter and Sons Ltd, of Fochabers,
Moray, go to 80 countries of the world
with the seal of approval that comes
with Royal warrants, from both the
Queen and the Queen Mother. But, per-
haps, there is some added cachet in the
fact that Baxters are the only firm per-
mitted to demonstrate their foods in the
exclusive London food shop, Fortnum
and Mason.
Mr Gordon Baxter, the present head
of the firm, was demonstrating his firm’s
foods in the rather more egalitarian
atmosphere of Sydney’s Showground
when we saw him. In spite of the firm’s
high connections, Mr Baxter believes that
the future lies in what he was not quite
prepared to call the mass market; rather
the general market. In Britain, he said,
Baxter’s foods were sold through Wool-
worths and other multiple-branch shops.
“I had a letter recently from a coal-
miner saying how much he enjoyed our
grouse in port wine jelly,” he said. “And
recently a Glasgow dock-worker wrote
to say he had tried our Royal game soup
and liked it.”
Mr Baxter said that his firm’s best
customers were still Scotland and Eng-
land, but there were good markets in
Canada, Sweden and Western Germany.
The firm used traditional Scottish recipes
and most of the ingredients game,
beef, wild and cultivated berries, and
vegetables were obtained locally. So,
too, were the whisky casks in which the
firm's vintage marmalade was matured
for several years. All Scottish whisky is
made Speyside, although it may be
blended elsewhere.
In the Food Hall at the Showground
Baxters’ tinned grouse, pheasant and
partridge are alongside such traditional
English foods as instant mashed potato,
gravy powder and bloater paste. Mr
Baxter admitted, but as tactfully as pos-
sible, that the task of selling Scottish
foods abroad was hampered by the fact
that the English have a somewhat poor
reputation for cooking and not everyone
can distinguish between English and
British. “I was just talking to a fellow
who asked me ‘What’s the difference
between British and English,” he said.
“His body’s lying somewhere out there.”
But in spite of this drawback, Mr
Baxter thoroughly enjoys being part of
the travelling British fair. “My grand-
father started the business in 1868 as a
grocer’s shop with £lO capital,” he said.
“The village was close to the seats of
the Dukes of Richmond and Gordon.
The Dukes had plenty of distinguished
visitors and my father had to stock the
foods they wanted. It was only a short
step from that to manufacturing. But
selling our foods around the world is
not so very different from talking to
customers across the grocer's shop
counter.”

VOU two im« Ules then again
y° U ot interest you a year!
rtroul'ave you thousands
Right now you probably think
that your company needs a
Cessna aircraft like it needs a
Castle in Spain.
A new company car? Maybe.
A new turret lathe? Perhaps.
What about a computer? Could
be!
But a Cessna! How could we
ever use a Cessna, you say. And
in any case we can’t afford that
sort of luxury.
Perhaps you’re right. Perhaps
you don’t need an aircraft.
Perhaps your company can’t
afford one.
But, then again, perhaps it
does. And can.
Do you know for instance that
there are several companies in
Australia (including one of
your competitors perhaps?)
which have proved conclusively
that a Cessna can save them
literally thousands of pounds a
year savings in such ex-
penses as car operation, hotel
accommodation, travelling ex-
penses, executive time. But
perhaps even more important
than saving costs, is the addi-
tional sales revenue they have
earned revenue they would
never have made without a
Cessna!
Of course you don’t leap out
and buy an aircraft just like
that. You didn’t get your other
equipment that way either. But
it could be that if you take the
trouble to work out just how
much of your personnel’s time
is taken up in travelling and
the costs involved you’ll
turn to light aircraft operation
for sound economic reasons.
There’s a Rex Aviation con-
sultant ready to help you make
a critical appraisal of your
company’s particular field of
operations.
If you’ve read this far you are
on your way to saving your
company real money. For you,
flying your own aeroplane may
NOT be the answer, but until
you investigate personally,
you’ll never know for sure.

Giving Us Curry
his way to Australia Sir William
Stewart stopped over in Bombay
and bought five tons of spices, then
another H tons in Colombo. He then
came on to Sydney where his mission
is to make every Australian eat curry.
But his activities at the Food Hall during
British Fortnight he describes as a “mere
skirmish”. We can expect a more inten-
sive campaign later.
Sir William has for 29 years owned
and run Veeraswarmy’s Restaurant in
Regent Street, Fondon, a place of pil-
grimage for most tourists. Now he has
taken what for him was the tremendous
step of putting his curries, the fruits of
120,000 miles of travel in India and
Pakistan, and untold tastings in the
kitchens of Veeraswarmy’s, into tins.
This was not done without much soul-
searching.
“However,” said Sir William, “I con-
ducted an experiment. I got three of my
best cooks and set dishes of the tinned
curry alongside the curry of the day and
asked them to taste. All of them decided
that the tinned curry was slightly finer
than the curry they had made that morn-
ing.” This might have persuaded Sir
William, a self-confessed perfectionist,
that his cooks were losing their palate.
However, he took the optimistic view
and put his tinned curry on the market.
Sir William has no favorite curry
himself. Nor does he believe that any
region of India produces the best curries.
“They have absolutely no standards,” he
said. “You simply have to go from place
to place, searching for recipes and trying
the food. And when you hear the
rumor of a good cook you’ve got to
flush him out. In India a man won’t
even tell his brother how he makes his
curries, for fear that his brother will
take his job. That’s the condition of life
there. So you can see how hard it is for
an outsider to find out anything.”

Elizabethan age,” Sir Arthur Bliss said.
“We have an amazing number of com-
posers in Britain today—Walton, Britten,
Tippett, Rawsthorne and each one
seems to be a distinct personality.”
Sir Arthur, Master of the Queen's
Musick, is making his first visit to Aus-
tralia for the ABC in association with the

cared very much about music,” he said.
“He had too many other things to worry
about. The Master of the King’s Musick
came into his own when Charles II
ascended the throne.
“Charles II loved music. He used to
conduct the choir of the Chapel Royal
and even wrote music of his own. I
believe that under the terms of the
original charter the holder is exempt
from paying taxes and has immunity
from arrest. But my legal advisers assure
me that to substantiate any such rights
would take a considerable amount of
money and about 100 years. So I con-
tinue to pay taxes. But, of course, the
Poet Laureate is legally entitled to a
tun of sack each year and I doubt
whether John Masefield ever receives his
sack.”
History records that the function of
the original Master of the King’s
Musick was “to guide and grace his
Majesty’s four and twenty fiddlers.”
Nowadays, Sir Arthur writes fanfares
for special occasions. He produced fan-
fares for the births of the Royal babies
and one for the opening of the Empire
Games in Perth. Sir Arthur has written
chamber music, a piano concerto and
several choral works, as well as the ballet
suites “Checkmate” and “Miracle in the
Gorbals”.
Two of his compositions are being per-
formed during his stay here. He is con-
ducting the Sydney Little Symphony
orchestra, a group from the Sydney
Symphony Orchestra, comprising strings,
woodwinds and horns, in a composition
called “A Knot of Riddles”.
“I shall be conducting an oratorio
called ‘The Beatitudes’ in Brisbane. The
Queensland Municipal Orchestra and
the Queensland Symphony Orchestra
will be performing. I love oratorios. I
wrote one for the reconsecration of
Coventry Cathedral. My task was to
measure the breathtaking scope of the
new building. I wrote it on a very large
scale.
“No, I haven’t written any film music
lately. I was the first to write serious
music for the films. That was H. G.
Wells’ The Shape of Things to Come.’
It's amazing how everything Wells pre-
dicted in that film seems to have come
true. Even to the idea of shooting a
man to the moon.
“I used to be very interested in jazz.
But I think it’s become too sophisticated
recently. I liked primitive jazz. The jazz
devised by the Negroes. You don't hear
a lot of that these days. Popular music
doesn't really interest me. I suppose by
pop music you mean the Beatles. I find
their stuff rather uninteresting. I mean
it all sounds the same to me.”

INSURANCE
Man from Lloyd’s
T loyd’s of London arrived in the
colony in 1816 when an agent was
appointed to Port Jackson to perform
intelligence work and check marine and
cargo claims coming from the new
settlement. This and other information
came our way from visiting chairman
of Lloyd’s, Mr R. W. Sturge, during a
chat in the dignified Sydney offices of
the famous governing body of British
insurance underwriters.
No stranger to Australia himself
Mr Sturge married an Australian on an
earlier visit he told us how Lloyd’s
agents arrived as the colonies multiplied.
“Riley and Jones were our first agents
in Sydney. Then in 1820 we appointed
a man in Van Diemen’s Land, at Swan
River in 1830, Adelaide in 1837, at Port
Phillip in 1839 and Moreton Bay in
1850.”
Mr Sturge said that Lloyd’s as a
marine and insurance business began in
the famous coffee house about 1688 and
a register of shipping has existed since
1760.
“There were actually two shipping
registers until 1834 when a common
problem of finance brought about re-
conciliation between the rivals and re-
sulted in the formation of Lloyd’s Regis-
ter of Shipping. This is completely in-
dependent of Lloyd’s although members
of the Committee of Lloyd’s also serve
on the Committee of Lloyd’s Register
of Shipping.”
Although Lloyd's is associated in the
public mind with marine insurance, the
greater part of the business done by the
group of independent underwriters, who
comprise membership of Lloyd's, is
nowadays non-marine. “Lloyd's under-
writers have constantly been developing
new fields,” Mr Sturge said. “For ex-
ample, we invented the burglary policy,
the loss of profits policy and the first in-
surance of jewellery against all risks
that was in 1890. Before that it was im-
possible to insure jewellery.
“In an allied field it is interesting that
we issued a Products Liability policy on
the parachutes carried by the American
astronauts. Members of the Whiskers
Club have their beards and moustaches
insured with us against fire or theft.
“One gentleman who intended going
over Niagara Falls in a barrel sought a
policy. We didn’t think it wise to issue
one.”

The Science of
Wine Tasting
And the best finale: a long glass of beer
By CELLARMASTER
Golf immortal James Braid, five
times winner of the British Open,
was once asked to suggest three
ways to better one’s game. He replied,
“By playing golf, playing golf, playing
golf.” This is easily paraphrased into
an answer to the question, “How do I
improve my palate?”; and, indeed, by
tasting wine, tasting wine, tasting wine,
anybody’s appreciation must be en-
hanced.
How to taste wine? This column does
not propose to even try to talk about
taste sensations. Better that we should
discuss the various ways to conduct a
wine tasting, which is probably the
quickest route to comprehensive know-
ledge.
The popular picture of a wine tasting
is one of dim, candle-lit bistros, rows
upon rows of shining bottles, a few
plates of perspiring cheese, and dazzling
smiles turned with the better side toward
the Press photographer.
These can be fun as well as being in-
structional, but too often they are ruined
for the devotee simply because they try
to do too much. Two or three kinds of
sherry, a half-dozen or more whites,
some soft reds, other more astringent
ones, a few ports or other dessert wines
are too much for even the sturdiest
palate; and, if the wine is being sipped
and not spat, far too much for even a
stainless steel stomach. Yet this is often
the way things are conducted, and one
is soon lost in a heady maze of con-
fusion. These tastings may be fine for
charity functions and, indeed, aid the
cause of wine as well, but for serious
analysis and sober examination we must
go in for something much simpler.
HThe first thing is to decide what type of
wine to show, and to stick to it. If
this sounds too simple, consider the end-
less ways of doing this. You may taste
the wines of a district of the same year
and grape type, for example, a range of
Hunter whites from the Pokolbin or near
area, Tulloch, Elliot, McWilliams, Linde-
mans, Drayton, Tyrell. Or see what the
shiraz grape produces in different areas
—McClaren Vale, Reynella, Clare, An-
gaston, the Hunter, Rutherglen, and so
on.
Perhaps a wine from one vineyard and
maker but of different years, for
example, a series of Grange hermitages
or Tahbilk clarets. It is a good idea to
select a wine that you find outstanding
and attempt to match it with like wines
from the same district and year. Even
if you cannot find its equal, at least you
will better understand, after comparison,
why you think it is better than the others.
It is advisable to keep the numbers
down. This applies to both the bottles
and the people. A half dozen to a dozen
wines and not many more persons should
be sufficient, for too many of the former
will affect concentration, and too many
of the latter will preclude general dis-
cussion and enough wine to taste.
A few palate revivers, biscuits, cheese,
apples or just plain water, and perhaps
a taste card for reference purposes, com-
plete the picture. Ido not like showing
too old a wine at such tastings, for
usually it gets handled too much and
consequently may not be at its best.
Tastings run on these lines will aid the
aspirant enormously, but are in them-
selves limited by being just wine
tastings. If I appear to contradict myself,
let me explain. Wine is best drunk with
food; therefore, on occasion supply food
as part of the tasting, not just as an ad-
junct to it. For instance, recently, with
four others, I tasted five British cheeses
—Cheshire, Leicester, Double Glouces-
ter, Wensleydale and Caerphilly, with
five Rouge Homme clarets from Coona-
warra of different vintages.
A sip of this wine, a little of that
cheese—the wine was this year a little
thinner than that year, this cheese
appeared firmer in texture than the other,
and so on. Soon, caseology and oeno-
logy were all mixed up, bottles and
platters were empty, and we all felt we
knew much more about both.
When planning a dinner and giving a
lot of thought to the food, don't just
tack on the wine at appropriate intervals.
Rather, and especially if your guests are
as keen as you, choose two or even three
wines to go with each course, with a
decent interval in between courses for
rumination. It may drive your beloved
mad, but will certainly advance your
knowledge.
Again, it is extremely interesting to
cook regional foods, and pick regional
wines to go with them, such as the
classic boeuf a la bourguignonne accom-
panied by an imported burgundy, and
two suitable local counterparts.
As you may see, the possibilities are
endless and are all rewarding. Finally,
when the senses are dulled with perhaps
too much good wine and food, when the
mouth is full of tannin and flavors recur
and conflict, what is the best finale to the
occasion?
There is nothing like a long, cold glass
of Australian beer.


OVERSEAS
Death Waits
for Soekarno’s
Skymen
Two games down
From DENNIS BLOODWORTH
in Labis, South Malaysia
The Malay and Chinese children at
Labis clung to the wire fence
around the police station like flies
on a meat cover. On a small patch of
grass inside were six Indonesian regular
paratroopers in their camouflaged uni-
forms. They were flat on their backs in a
neat row, their wrists and ankles trussed
to carrying poles, their Javanese faces dis-
colored in death.
While the Security Council was still
considering Malaysia’s complaint against
Indonesian aggression, Guarkhas had shot
down these luckless executors of Pre-
sident Soekarno’s “confrontation” policy
with surgical precision in a jungle clash a
few miles north of this little township.
Altogether, Malaysian security forces
have killed or captured nearly 70 of the
Indonesian terrorist force estimated to
be about 95 strong that parachuted on
September 2 into the State of Johore,
South Malaysia.
Farther south, troops and police have
eliminated more than 60 of the group
that landed from the sea in the Pontian
area in August, and only a handful re-
main at liberty. Another small party
that hit the coast on September 9 was
caught almost immediately.
Not the men, but the second-rate plan-
ners in Djakarta who despatched them on
their fool’s errand to Malaysia, must be
blamed for what one Malaysian officer
has bitterly described as “these moronic
operations”. Embarked in two Hercules
transport aircraft near Djakarta for what
some of them even thought was only a
training flight, the paratroopers were
dropped by night into inhospitable enemy
country in Malaya proper.
The more fortunate group landed in
a cleared development area of tree
stumps and rubber saplings five miles
north of Labis, but the second wave fell
straight into mountainous primary jungle
20 miles further north, where an RAF
Shackleton on reconnaissance later spot-
ted several of their olive-green parachutes
hooked up in the tall trees.
The young paratroopers were well-
equipped with light machine-guns, and
with grenades and compasses. Each car-
ried six days’ rations, civilian clothes, 300
Malaysian dollars in singletons, and in
some cases a representative collection of
pornographic pictures. But all those
killed or captured were without maps
and presumably depended like blind men
on the few Malaysian renegades who ac-
companied them.
Among the Malay traitors, the hooli-
gans and malcontents who were in this
only for money and mayhem outnumber-
ed the Left-wing extremists of the So-
cialist Front who wanted to destroy Ma-
laysia and its present Government for
purely political reasons. The rest were
tough young Malaysian Communists,
youths obedient to a clandestine party
which was contemptuous of Indonesians
and saw Soekarno’s “Crush Malaysia”
campaign as a means to overthrow the
State by violence and to seize power for
Peking in the ensuing chaos.
Those who had been briefed on the
operation believed the Malaysians would
welcome them with open arms. The ob-
ject was to set up a guerrilla base from
which the Malaysians of the party could
fan out to recruit sympathisers and
cadres in the surrounding kampongs on
the jungle fringe. Their expanding
“liberated” zone would then be protected
by a friendly, conniving civilian screen.
They would disrupt communications,
and tie down troops so that other districts
would be wide open to further terrorist
assault from Indonesia. Chinese women
were included in the parachuted force
one has been killed and two more
captured so far to work on the
female element in the population.
The blindfolded man who stumbled
across the road to Labis police station,
his arm firmly gripped by a Gurkha,
personified the fate of this ill-conceived
scheme. He is dirty, fit, but listless
from hunger. He has shed his paratroop
uniform and wears a white shirt and
blue cotton trousers. Detailed off as a
“volunteer” from the Third Parachute
Regiment of the Indonesian regular
army, he is one of many who have given
up without fighting and taken his captors
into the jungle to show them where he
has hidden his uniform, equipment and
arms.
Other hungry terrorists walk into vil-
lages in search of food, or sit down in
cafes and try to order lunch with a
simulated Johore accent, or trek down
to main roads and ask taxi-drivers to
take them into town But villagers seize
them, a small boy in the cafe runs for the
nearest soldier, the taxi-driver deposits
them at the next police station. The
civilians of Johore have shown a sturdy
loyalty, although a heavy percentage is
of Indonesian origin. There is a reward
of 2,500 Malaysian dollars (nearly £300)
for terrorists turned in.
They face a formidable, seemingly
übiquitous professional combination of
Gurkha, helicopter and football pitch.
“This war will be won on the playing-
fields of Malaysia,” remarked an Aus-
tralian recently, and he may be proved
correct. From Song in Sarawak to Labis,
750 miles away in Johore, the local
school soccer ground is the launching
pad of the national defence system in
a country short of airstrips.
At Labis the children, bored with the
sunbaked corpses, abandon the police
wire for this sure-fire attraction.
There are scouts of the Army Air
Corps and Whirlwinds of the RAF, their
spinning vanes blowing up a hurricane of
dust as they land and take off. And there
are the Royal Navy’s Wessex choppers
that plant stocky Gurkhas into the for-
bidding, rolling jungle to the north.
Just practising
Gurkha is a cheerful, unemotional
A rough-country mercenary. He likes
football, draughts at which he will
regularly beat his predominantly British
officers canned rum and good drink-
ing water, an his tastes are simple.
In Sarawak two Gurkhas run into four
Indonesian terrorists in the jungle; the
four terrorists die with merciful speed.
Near Labis three paratroopers attack a
solitary Gurkha sentry; two are shot dead
at once and the third killed later. The
Gurkha is unscratched.
It may take some time to scrape out
from the depths of the jungle the hard
residue of the Indonesian task force north
of Labis, But otherwise Soekarno is two
games down, and it remains to be seen
whether he still insists on the best of three
or more. The Gurkhas are careful to
emphasise that the Javanese is a tough
soldier when well trained and properly
led, but this does not seem to apply here
yet.
“We are just practising,” explained one
Gurkha officer softly, and the cruelty
of the remark lay in the very gentleness
of his tone, (ofns)

A Johnson Landslide?
But “Remember 1948”
From GEORGE McGANN in New York
Barry Goldwater’s conduct of his
campaign for the Presidency grows
curiouser and curiouser. Far from
“running scared”, as all public opinion
polls indicate he ought to be doing,
the Senator from Arizona talks and acts
like a man who feels so sure of victory
that he can afford to ignore all the
traditional rules of political campaigning.
In the space of the last fortnight the
Republican candidate has repeatedly
violated one of the cardinal principles
of practising politicians telling his
audiences what they want to hear. Pained
silences, rather than the accolades of
applause or cheers, have greeted many
of his utterances on the hustings in
Florida, Tennessee and West Virginia.
So unorthodox is the pattern of his
campaigning that his opponents are
beginning to wonder out aloud about
“a political suicide complex”.
It must be borne in mind that most
polls both the so-called private polls,
made locally on behalf of political par-
ties or individual candidates, and the
nation-wide surveys such as the Gallup
Poll indicate a vote for President
Johnson of landslide proportions. At this
moment, less than six weeks before elec-
tion day, November 3, two out of three
American voters apparently prefer John-
son to Goldwater.
The answer of the Goldwater forces
is “Remember ’4B”. In 1948, of course,
President Truman fooled all the major
pollsters, who had predicted substantial
victory for Thomas Dewey. Since then
the public opinion polls have correctly
predicted the two victories of President
Eisenhower and the narrow win by Presi-
dent Kennedy.
For reasons best known to himself and
his advisers, Goldwater chose the un-
likely locale of Charleston, West Vir-
ginia, one of the most depressed econ-
omic areas in the country, to deride
President Johnson’s anti-poverty pro-
gramme. The President had recently
visited West Virginia, where poverty
and unemployment are widespread and
chronic, due to closed coal mines and
vanished industry, and promised it would
be one of the principal beneficiaries of
Federal help under his anti-poverty pro-
posals.
In Charleston Senator Goldwater
nonetheless likened the entire concept of
Federal assistance to the Marxist
formula, “from each according to his
abilities, to each according to his needs.”
With singular lack of grace he declared
it all went back to the apes, “who merely
piled coconuts on the ground and allow-
ed any other ape to take what he liked.
Then some smart ape invented the free
enterprise system,” Goldwater went on,
“under which they took care of their
brothers in need, but not their brothers
who refused to work and wanted to live
off them.”
This theme, that the poor have only
themselves to blame, is one of the Sena-
tor’s favorite campaign lines, but one
wonders how it went down with the
families of jobless miners forced to sub-
sist on welfare handouts.
One wonders, too, what inspired Gold-
water to launch an attack on Medicare,
the Administration’s plan to place health
insurance for the aged under the social
security system, in a campaign speech in
Florida, one of the principal retirement
States in the Union, where there are
more old people living solely on social
security payments than anywhere else
in the country.
Again, in Tennessee, whose proudest
ornament is the vast Tennessee Valley
Authority network of publicly-owned
hydro-electric power systems, Goldwater
repeated his vow to sell the entire com-
plex to private power companies.
Many in his audience carried signs:
“Sell TVA? I’d rather sell Arizona.”
At the same time Goldwater managed
to tour the Southern States of Florida,
Tennessee and elsewhere without making
direct reference to the biggest issue of
all below the Mason-Dixon Line; he
made no mention of the Civil Rights
Bill, which he had voted against and
which made a hero of him in the South.
Instead he referred again and again to
what he terms “the law and order issue”
of crime in the streets, by which he
means Negro crime in the streets of
Harlem, Rochester and other black
ghettoes.
Another notable aspect of Goldwater’s


Tired of the
Executive
Rat-Race?
WELL, GET OUT OE IT!
The longer you ‘sit’ on a job the
harder it looks. Any good executive
knows that. Yet decisions are put
off by the thousand every day.
‘Difficult’ jobs go into the ‘too
hard’ basket.
This procrastination is like a disease
in business. It’s the by-product of
the Executive Life. The pressure
goes on the strain gets tougher
• the mind often flags. Result?
Work looks harder so takes more
out of you. So the mind flags more.
The rat-race is on.
A mind under pressure needs good
care. The executive life tension,
worry, hurried unbalanced meals,
alcohol often leads to a deficiency
of essential B Group vitamins.
These are the vitamins —BI in
particular which have a signifi-
cant effect in conserving nervous
energy. Additional B 1 is often pres-
cribed during periods of physical
stress and excessive mental activity.
You may not get adequate Vitamin
B from your meals. The drinks you
have to relax you, increase your
needs still further.
It’s comparatively easy to stop the
rat-race and get off. But you must
make a decision. You must put
yourself on to ‘TAB-VITA’ B
GROUP FORT tablets. This is a
potent source of B group vitamins
enriched with Vitamin C. It is not
a miracle ‘cure’ but if taken regularly
may do a lot to help restore your
initiative and drive. Get out of that
rat-race. Tear out this advertisement
and go to your chemist. Or send
your secretary to get a bottle.

Tear out the ad now don’t put
it in the ‘too hard’ basket, please.
PD 12/9705
campaign is his ability to reduce complex
questions to the level of his immediate
audience. “A lot of my enemies call
me simple,” he said the other day at a
supermarket. “The big trouble with the
so-called liberal today is that he does
not understand simplicity. I refuse to go
around this country discussing compli-
cated, twisted issues.”
The Democrats pounced on this state-
ment as one of the reasons for Gold-
water’s habit of offering off-the-cuff solu-
tions, which he later contradicts, of
important problems. His relations with
the Press are constantly deteriorating.
No other candidate in recent Ameri-
can history not even Richard Nixon,
whose bitter blast at the Press after his
defeat for the California governorship
is a living legend has become so
isolated from the reporters whose daily
duty it is to follow and report him as
has Goldwater.
Never once in nearly a month of
barnstorming about the country in the
same plane with 50 Pressmen has Gold-
water ventured aft to speak to them, on
or off the cuff. Many of these same
newsmen treasure the memory of candi-
date John Kennedy and the intimate,
often hilarious, give-and-take they en-
joyed aboard his private plane four years
ago.
At the strong urging of the news-
starved correspondents, Goldwater aides
prevailed upon the candidate to sche-
dule formal Press conferences on two
occasions. However, Goldwater cancel-
led both conferences without explana-
tion.
The extent of the defection of the
normally Republican-oriented Press to
President Johnson is quite astonishing,
and obviously transcends the personal
animosity between the ordinary reporter
and the candidate. In recent weeks the
usually right-wing Hearst newspaper
chain, which had not supported a De-
mocrat for the Presidency since Frank-
lin Roosevelt’s 1932 campaign, and the
“Saturday Evening Post”, which had
never endorsed a Democrat since the
founding of the Republican Party, were
among dozens of other publications
which have been flocking to the Johnson
banner.
The “Satevepost”, as it likes to call
itself, claims to have had Benjamin
Franklin as its first editor. Although it
has been in serious financial straits in
recent years, due principally to a dusty
management and the inroads of televi-
sion, this Philadelphia-based publication
has always spoken editorially in the ac-
cents of the “Main Line”, its home city’s
impeccable, wealthy and solidly Repub-
lican communities.
It must have come as something of a
shock to many Mainliners to read in the
“Satevepost” that “Lyndon Johnson must
be re-elected and Goldwater crushingly
defeated for the good of the Republican
Party, which his candidacy disgraces.”
In phrases which might have rolled out
of the roneo machines of the Democratic
National Committee, the traditional Re-
publican mouthpiece labelled Goldwater
a “grotesque burlesque of the conserva-
tive he pretends to be ... a wild man,
a stray, an unprincipled and ruthless
political ju-jitsu artist like Joe Mc-
Carthy,” and called upon all good Re-
publicans to “drive the fanatic saboteurs
of the party back into the woodwork
whence they came.”
With this editorial indictment, the
“Satevepost” thus joined the ranks of
what Goldwater’s Press aides have jok-
ingly, or perhaps not jokingly, called
“the rat-fink eastern Press”.
With such liberal Eastern newspapers
as the “New York Herald Tribune” still
uncommitted to either candidate, more
than six times as many American news-
papers have endorsed President Johnson
as have announced support for Senator
Goldwater.
President plays it cool
11/leanwhile, the professional politician
in the White House, despite a
notoriously low boiling point when it
comes to personal criticism such as he
absorbs daily from Senator Goldwater
and his running mate, Vice-Presidential
candidate Miller, plays it cool, stressing
national unity in his informal Press con-
ferences and studiously avoiding mention
of his opponents names. He even man-
aged to control himself when Goldwater
complained:
“Why can’t Johnson take criticism
he takes everything else?”
The President apparently feels secure,
at the moment, in the knowledge that
he enjoys the confidence (if not the great
love or admiration his predecessor in-
spired) of the majority of his fellow citi-
zens. A “New York Times” survey dis-
closed that the public regarded Senator
Goldwater as the central issue of the
campaign, not the occupant of the White
House. People responded to Goldwater
with various degrees of trepidation or
adulation, but are taking Johnson more
or less for granted.


Chat in a Pub
" Can you trust Mr Wilson?"
From KENNETH HARRIS in London
is the British General Elec-
\w tion going to be about? British
T newspapers, television and radio
talk of the election being about defence,
the cost of living, pensions, housing and
so on. But are these the main issues
which are in the mind of the man-in-
the-street?
Let us (I am with a friend from
abroad) step into the local pub. Ah,
one of the habitues is coming towards
us. He does not know you, who are
from San Francisco, or Sydney or else-
where, but he knows me, because he
sees me in political programmes on
British television from time to time and
assumes that all I want to talk about
is politics.
“Who do you think is going to win
on October 15?” he says, and then with-
out waiting for an answer, because in
fact he is not interested in my view
but only in the opportunity of expressing
his own, tells me he thinks it will be the
well, what does it matter . . .
What matters are the questions he
begins to pose himself under the influ-
ence of his second pint. His first is: “Can
you trust Mr Wilson?”
This is a question which has been
asked for some years of the present
leader of the Labor Party and, though
the Labor Party has apparently answered
it to its satisfaction, it has not been
answered to the satisfaction of a great
many other people.
Mr Wilson is still thought by many to
have been disloyal to his leader, Mr
Hugh Gaitskell, when the Party was
being torn in two in 1960 by the con-
troversy over whether to give up the
hydrogen bomb. Later he ran against
Mr Gaitskell for the leadership of the
Parliamentary Labor Party.
Secondly, his appearance on television
over the last 18 months, although ex-
tremely successful in many ways, have
led many people including Labor
supporters to describe him in such
terms as “a bit too clever” or “glib”
or “lacking in humanity”.
Another pint of beer and issue number
two is raised: “Apart from Mr Wilson,
who have the Labor Party got?”
You hear that James Callaghan, the
shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer,
is thought to be nice; straight; human,
but does he really know his job? Then
there is the shadow Foreign Secretary,
Patrick Gordon-Walker. In his appear-
ance on radio and television he has been
making good impressions on the viewer,
but naturally he has not had time to
become a symbol of foreign affairs,
expertise, let alone a household name.
Millions of people, I dare say, would
not be able to fell you what his job is
going to be.
Even fewer people would be able
to identify the extremely able Dennis
Healey, our putative Labor Minister of
Defence. Fewer people still could tell
you much about one of the ablest and
most steadfast men in British politics
today, Michael Stewart, for whom any-
thing might be possible. And so on.
Labor’s change of faces
TTarold Wilson’s team, in fact, has the
JLi disadvantage of having to emerge
13 years since the Labor Party was last
in office, with a total change of faces on
the Front Bench.
The third pint, and the third point:
“Will a Labor Government be able to
stand up to the trade unions?” By now
any citizen who is in the least interested
in politics has had it hammered into his
head by the newspapers that the trade
unions pay the bulk of the Labor Party’s
funds at annual party conferences. “We
have had enough trouble from the trade
unions under a Conservative Govern-
ment. It will be worse under a Labor
Government.”
The fourth and final question that
will come up: “But anyway, why should
we change? The bulk of the people in
this country know that they have never
had it so good.” Sections of the com-
munity are suffering, but they are
minorities.
In the last few days Mr Wilson has
been saying things which have left two
firm impressions in the public mind:
first, that there is a great deal wrong
with Britain, and, secondly, that in his
“first 100 days” he is going to be very
tough and use everything at his dis-
posal in order to “put things right”.
Many people think this is the first mis-
take he has made in his 18 months as
leader of the Party. And that it could
prove fatal.
All this may make it seem as though
the man-in-the-street is seeing the elec-
tion in terms only of the Labor Party.
In a sense that is true. It is, after all,
the Opposition which is demanding a
change in office, which is challenging.
It is the Opposition which is receiving
the scrutiny the others can stand on
their record. And that, from the point
of view of the man-in-the-street, is pretty
good. So, to the Opposition he says, in
effect, “Show me!” (ofns)
The French satirical newspaper "Le Canard Enchaine" has offered
these helpful hat hints to General de Gaulle during his current
tour of ten South American countries. They include a Panama,
a Bolivar, an Amazonian head-dress, a Chilean hat, a sombrero, a
planter's hat, a bush hat, a Gran Chaco - and a clown's hat. He
himself is taking as presents pieces of Sevres porcelain. He expects
to return with the Cross of the South, the Condor of the Andes,
the Order of Simon Bolivar and Colombia's Boyaca.

HIGH JINKS IN THE HARD TOP
p\)R those who despair of our Mel-
bourne ever becoming the gay
city, it was a singularly encouraging
week. Warner Brothers and Star-
dawn Investments Pty Ltd invited us
to morning coffee to talk about the
Palladium Entertainment Centre, a
£l} million project, “the first of its
kind in the world.”
At first we were rather put off by
that name, Palladium; after all, in
recent years all our theatres have been
changing their names to give titles
that smack of good breeding like
Rapallo, Chelsea, the Barclay and the
Esquire. However, we were told that
the Palladium would have two magni-
ficent theatres, a first-class licensed
restaurant run by Maxim’s of South
Yarra, and parking space for 700
cars. They were using the site of Tye’s
ancient furniture house in Bourke
Street. And the building would have
an indoor street. Do you get the plot?
The patrons will be able to drive
right inside, hand the car over to a
parking attendant, eat dinner at
Maxim’s, and then walk into either
of two theatres for the night's shows.
Actually, the two theatres are not
very large. The My Fair Lady
Theatre, which will house the film
version of the play for two solid
years, only seats 850, and the Em-
bassy Theatre is even smaller with
400. But it was made clear to us
that this was the trend the world
over. Big theatres now are passe. They
have to be small, intimate, to give
something of that feeling of being
home with one’s TV set.
And, besides, a small theatre looks
much better than a large one when
it s only half full. Yet they would be
as modern as it was possible to make
them. George Hardwick, of Star-
dawn Investments, said the My Fair
Lady Theatre would have one of the
biggest screens in a hardtop in Aus-
tralia (a hard-top, you must under-
stand, is theatre vernacular for non-
open-air drive-in).
The Embassy would have Cinema-
Scope, but My Fair Lady would have
Super Panavision, 38 feet wide. Oh,
yes, the walls will be draped in Thai
silk, the armchairs will be in black
leather, and it's all due to open on
December 9. Gordon Banfield, the
architect, says the whole project is
being carried out on the “critical
path” system; that is, before they
started the programme was fed
through a computer which gave a
chart several miles long. This chart
gave the precise times when painters,
plasterers, plumbers, glaziers and the
rest all moved in. We were a little
sceptical of the success of this idea,
but Banfield said it had to work
there was a £4OOO a week penalty
clause in the contract.
Gordon Banfield then revealed that
he was the architect for another £1
million project already under way
and due to open in October, 1965.
This is to be a night-club restaurant.
The top four floors will be offices,
the next seven will be a car park, and
the ground floor will be the night-club
restaurant. It will be the one place
in the country where you will be
able to drive in, walk downstairs,
have dinner, a drink, and see a show
at the same time.
The restaurant will be terraced with
tables and chairs to each terrace, all
looking down on a live show with a
revolving stage. Actually they would
like to call it a theatre restaurant,
but around here you can’t get a
licence for a theatre, so with great
subtlety they have to call it a theatre
night-club.
that's not all; we’re getting a
roof-top licensed restaurant, the
first in Australia. Mr Richard Frank,
of Ricklee Pty Ltd, has been battling
for this for a long time. He has tried
for every tall building that has gone
up in Melbourne. For a time he
thought he almost clinched it with our
tallest, the CRA building in Collins
Street, but it couldn't be done with
the fire regulations. Now he opens
on Melbourne Cup eve on the 20th
floor of the National Mutual Building,
and the name is “Top of the Town”.
He’s spending £30,000 on furniture
and decorations. The carpet will be
nigger brown to represent the earth,
and there will be a grey suspended
ceiling to symbolise a nice, typical
Melburnian cloudy sky.
Of course, there will be express lifts
straight to the 20th floor from the
500-car park in the basement. But
Mr Frank has one little gimmick.
For those who have no car there will
be free taxis laid on to the theatres
on opening nights. We do hope that
the prices will not be top of the town.
Actually there is another roof-top
restaurant at the Royal Automobile
Club, but Mr Frank decries this.
That’s a private club, he says, and
besides, his restaurant can look down
on it.
Anything else? Well, yes; last
week the John Batman Motor Inn in
Queen’s Road opened a convention
and conference room. You may re-
member the John Batman was
designed by Robin Boyd. It has
rooms with Sidney Nolans and Albert
Tuckers on the walls, floors covered
with kangaroo-skin carpet, and ac-
commodation for the very best dogs.
When one registers one is handed a
breakfast card for one’s dog, and
it is possible to see that he is served
with Aberdeen Angus steak at 8 a.m.
This time Mr Boyd has designed
a convention room which is divided
into two parts. Up one end is a board
room (sound-proof) which has a
board table of Indian teak, big black
leather armchairs and a rather larger
swivel throne for the chairman. Soft
music is provided, there are bars in
both rooms, complete with utterly sil-
ent refrigerators, and trapdoors which
lead out into the passage so that
extra supplies of scotch can be fed
in without disturbing the delegates.
As each delegate registers he gets a
name plate, a pad, a writing board
and, like the dogs, a card to fill out
asking when he would like his coffee
served, white or black, with or with-
out sugar, served direct to his own
numbered black leather armchair.
The colors in the conference room
would be described as strong, and the
air - conditioning works at double
power to clear the cigar smoke. As
pointed out earlier, we’re doing our
best to make this city more comfort-
able.

Agreeable Images, False Beliefs
Catholics , Jews , Nazis and Communists
By B. A. SANTAMARIA
The issues I would like to discuss
can be summed up in a few sen-
tences.
(1) There is a totalitarian threat to
civilisation in the 20th century.
(2) It is different in kind from mere
political authoritarianism a form of
government which may use the distaste-
ful weapons of autocracy in politics, but
which leaves many spheres of life at
least relatively free to the individual and
to organised groups smaller than the
State.
(3) The weapons of coercion in the
hands of governments in the 20th cen-
tury are of unprecedented power. The use
to which the totalitarians are prepared
to put them are limited by no law. Be-
cause of this, the prospects of overthrow-
ing a totalitarian regime from within are
practically nil. Hungary provides the
most recent example.
(4) Totalitarian government, which
seeks consciously to absorb every aspect
of life in the national community, creates
a particular challenge for minority
groups, especially if they are racial or
religious. Since they are organised and
“different” they attract the hostile in-
terest of the nationalist; and every totali-
tarian revolution, however international-
ist its original premises may be, has
some flavor of nationalism about it, as
the Sino-Soviet dispute indicates.
(5) The totalitarian threat also creates
serious problems for minorities in their
mutual relationships. It is obvious that
if minority groups, although they differ
from each other in origin and outlook,
can find a degree of organised unity in
the struggle against the totalitarian, they
may present an effective bar to totali-
tarianism by the simple relationship of
numbers to political power. But if they
are not even conscious of each other,
or if, worse still, they are hostile to each
other under the totalitarian threat, then
the common enemy has simply to apply
the tactics of “divide and conquer” to
despatch them singly.

To evaluate the points I propose to
put before you for discussion you will
need to understand my assumptions.
They are largely personal, for I do not
This is a condensed version of an
address given to the Melbourne Uni-
versity Jewish Students’ Society.
represent anyone, least of all the Catholic
community as a whole. Nor do I intend
to be the mouthpiece of anyone's “party
line”. I see no percentage in endeavoring
loyally to prove, in the matters under dis-
cussion between us, that Catholics have
always behaved nobly or even compre-
hensibly. They often have: on many
issues they have behaved badly, some-
times shockingly.
These are the personal assumptions
brought to the preparation of these
thoughts.
First, I was born in Australia. My
primary, though not exclusive, interest
is Australia. If I believe that Australia
faces a serious danger to her survival
as a nation —as indeed I do and have
believed for nearly a quarter of a century
then I believe that some special effort
must be exerted by Australians. This
derives from real considerations, not a
romantic patriotism. I come from a
family of five brothers and one sister,
who today have about 40 children be-
tween them. To different degrees I am
bound to them and they to me. They are
40 roots which have struck in Australian
soil. I have eight children some now
approaching marriageable age. If they
marry and have children of their own,
they will be other links again and quite
inevitably tied to this country for good
or ill.
I am therefore primarily concerned
with what happens to Australia and with
how you and 1 should behave in relation
to that vast problem. This is of
greater immediate importance than the
celebrated “wrongs of Ireland” or the
ancient wrongs which Jews and Catholics
mutually suffered at each other's hands
in Central and Eastern Europe.
Second, I was born of Italian parents.
They have been in Australia nearly 70
years, and they have become well assimi-
lated in the Australian community, even
though my mother does not speak English
well even today. Through my Italian
origin I know what racial prejudice is.
I lived my boyhood in the industrial sub-
urb of Brunswick, of which my recollec-
tions are generally very pleasant. But not
uniformly so. To not a few, I was just
a “Dago”. I resented this less than the
thought that my parents, who were so
outstanding as parents and as citizens,
were just “Dagoes” too. As far as I am
concerned, racial prejudice is not a mere
theoretical concept. I haven't just read
about it in books. Later in life I knew
what it was for racial and religious bitter-
ness to be made into a political factor
against the ideas to which I was fervently
attached. The name of “Santamaria” is a
dirty word in Australian life: and it was
made a dirty word quite consciously by
those who knew the power of racial and
religious bitterness. In mentioning this
matter I am not “squealing”. If a job is to
be done in public life, the political and
economic interests of those who hold
political and economic power are inevit-


ably affected. It is natural that they
should strike back, and that one suffers
in the process.
Third, I am a Catholic, who is both
convinced and committed. I believe in a
personal God, Who in many ways which
I can barely understand involves Himself
in the history of His Creation. I believe
that Jesus Christ was God.
Finally, I believe that truth, honesty,
sincerity provide the only permanent
basis of understanding and even co-
operation between people of highly dif-
ferent outlooks, cultures and back-
grounds such as the Jews and the Catho-
lics. This is not a platitude. We live in
an age whose characteristic figure is the
PR man, in which men are more con-
cerned to cultivate an agreeable “image”
than to be firm and strong and charitable,
in which “making the right noises” is
regarded as more important than thinking
the right thought or doing the right thing.
This set of values affects me like an
emetic. I have very great sympathy for
the viewpoint expressed in the article by
Rabbi Dr Berkovits of the Hebrew
Theological College of the Jewish Uni-
versity of America, which was published
in the “Australian Jewish Herald” on
May 1, 1964. He was referring to that
statement on the so-called responsibility
of the Jewish race as a whole for the
death of Jesus Christ, which is likely to
be made in the present session of the
Vatican Council. He referred also to
the delighted reaction in certain Jewish
circles. And Dr Berkovits added:
“One thinks especially of the sugges-
tion that the time has now come to
reciprocate the Catholic gesture pro-
posed, by the Jewish gesture of
acknowledging Jesus as a major Jewish
prophet.
“Are we going to reduce all religion,
all faith, the highest considerations of
human commitment to a cheap act of
improving public relations?
“Has faith become a mere bagatelle
to be used for the improvement of our
public image?”
I agree with Dr Berkovits. The hoary
old attitude of so many Catholics in past
ages that the Jewish race is in some way
collectively responsible for the death of
Jesus Christ and that this in some way
justifies anti-Semitism is historically un-
sound and morally untenable. It ought to
have been fought long ago by the Catho-
lic Church in precisely the way in which
the Vatican Council proposes to fight it
now. But you don’t have to shout
gratitude because we are belatedly doing
what is right. Equally, Jesus Christ, for
us, is God. The fact that you might give
Him recognition as a Jewish prophet does
not make Him more or less God. It does
not affect the situation or our position
in any way. Dr Berkovits is right. We
ought to get rid of centuries of concen-
trated disdain which lies between us,
simply because to rid ourselves of it is
an expression of the Law of Love to
which both of us pay lip-service. We will
do this by meeting each other, talking
to each other, being honest about our
differences (which in theological matters
seem to be unbridgeable), and seeking to
find common ground despite them.
For good or evil, those are my assump-
tions. They may please you or displease
you, but there they are.
“The Representative”
tThiE relationships of the Jewish and
Catholic groups in Western society
have become the subject of controversy
as the result of the production of Hoch-
huth’s play “The Representative”.
The case presented against Pius XII is
essentially simple. It can be summed up
in the words of Dr Joseph Lichten,
Director of the International Affairs De-
partment of the Anti-Defamation League
of B'nai B'rith. “In brief,” he writes, (it
is) “that as head of one of the most
powerful moral forces on earth, he com-
mitted an unspeakable sin of omission by
not issuing a formal indictment condemn-
ing the Nazis' genocidal slaughter of the
Jews, and that his silence was motivated
by reasons considered in modern times
as base; political exigency, economic in-
terests and personal ambition.”
Speaking frankly, as a Catholic, I can
only wish that Pius XII had found it
possible, as a matter of sound judgment,
to have publicly denounced the slaughter
of the Jews as a matter of principle.
That there were very many instances in
Which Catholic bishops and the Pope
himself rendered personal assistance to
innumerable members of the European
Jewish community is certain. A prin-
cipled condemnation of genocide would
have removed any occasion for doubt of
debate. But it was not I who had to
make the decision. And the decision, to
be made responsibly, had to be made on
far weightier grounds than what would
make Catholics, a generation later, feel
comfortable. Only Pius XII had all of
the facts needed to make that judgment.
I simply am not in a position to say
whether his judgment, as distinct from
his motives, was right or wrong. I am
not prepared to condemn him, simply be-
cause certain Catholic writers have dis-
covered that it is fashionable to condemn
the Pope for not making decisions which
would have prostrated them, had they
ever been faced with the necessity for
making the decisions which he faced.
The essential case for the attitude of
Pius XII was that contained in the state-
ment which he made in his letter to the
College of Cardinals on June 2, 1943:
“Every word that we addressed to
the responsible authorities and every
one of our pubiic declarations had to
be seriously weighed and considered
in the interest of the persecuted them-
selves in order not to make their situa-
tion unwittingly even more difficult
and unbearable.”
The Pope no doubt had before him
the experience of the Dutch Catholic
bishops a year earlier. In July, 1942, to-
gether with the Dutch Protestant Chur-
ches, they sent a protest to the Reich
Kommissar against the deportation of the
Dutch Jews. As Lewy states it, “They
threatened to make their protests public
unless the deportations were halted. The
Germans responded by offering to
exempt from deportation non-Aryans
converted to Christianity before 1941 if
the churches agreed to remain silent.
The Dutch Reformed Church accepted
the bargain, but the Catholic Archbishop
of Utrecht refused and issued a pastoral
letter in which he denounced the wrong
done to the Jews. The Germans retaliated
by seizing, and deporting, all the Catho-
lic non-Aryans they could find, among
them Edith Stein.”
The example was therefore clearly be-
fore Pius XII. The Archbishop of
Utrecht made the protest of principle
which Hochhuth says that Pius XII
should have made. From the historical
viewpoint his moral position is unassail-
able. Pragmatically, his protest can be
held to have made the situation worse. It
is only fair to point out, however, that
there were several situations in which the
protests of Catholic bishops did have a
practical effect.
Which was the right policy?
The answer will be a matter of per-
sonal judgment, and it cannot be elevated
into anything more absolute. All that any
one of us can do is to thank God that
he was not called upon to make the deci-
sion which Pius had to make.
As I understand the situation, similar
questions are asked of the Jewish com-
munity itself by Hannah Arendt in her
book on Eichmann. One of her theses is
summed up in the following words:
“This (Jewish) leadership, almost
without exception, co-operated in one
way or another, for one reason or an-
other, with the Nazis. This (story)
offers the most striking insight into the
totality of the moral collapse the Nazis
caused in respectable European society
not only in Germany but in almost


all countries, not only among the perse-
cutors but also among the victims.”
I do not pretend to be able to judge
the internal situation of the Jewish com-
munity. But the existence of this ana-
logical situation is not without its impor-
tance.
For me, as a Catholic, it is interesting
that a Jewish writer can ask exactly the
same question about the Jewish leader-
ship which Hochhuth asks about Pius
XII. I know that Hannah Arendt has
many Jewish opponents who repudiate
her thesis. But even these Jewish oppo-
nents, however, accept the truth to which
this analogy points that once a totali-
tarian movement actually seizes power,
the reaction of the community is quite
predictable. A few heroes will undoubt-
edly take their stand and be sent to the
concentration camp or death. The vast
majority will be too paralysed by fear
for their families even more than for
themselves to do anything to help their
neighbor. There will be some who believe
that the best practical formula is to re-
main alive within the framework of the
totalitarian society, to make all kinds of
compromises in order to moderate the
evils which will come. This is a most diffi-
cult alternative to choose, for who can
judge the real motives of those who com-
promise with totalitarianism?
Are we not driven to this central truth
that the time to resist totalitarianism
is before it seizes power? It is here that
moral issues really arise, which one is
more confident of judging Genuine
totalitarians are men beyond law. A genu-
inely totalitarian regime is nothing but
hell on earth. It does not matter whether
it is Nazi or Communist. Once it is in
power, there are few human options at
all. The genocidal murder of the Jews
was one enormous crime of totalitarian-
ism. The collectivisation of the peasantry
by Stalin in 1933 was another —and who
knows whether or not more Russian and
Ukrainian peasants perished in that but-
chery than Jews perished under Hitler?
The physical extirpation of the so-called
counter-revolutionaries by the Chinese
Communists between 1949 and 1953 was
still another.
Perhaps I am too pragmatic, too ob-
sessed with practicality. But it has al-
ways seemed to me that making sonorous
protests against the many examples of
the brutalities of totalitarianism —whether
it is Nazi or Communist is no substi-
tute at all for preventing the totalitarians
from coming to power in the first place.
Ihe real drama
Jhe real drama to which a Hochhuth
should have turned his pen should
not have been the tragic dilemma of
Pius XII, but rather the real and un-
deniable failure of the Catholic commu-
nity of Germany to do what lay in its
power to prevent the rise of Hitler to
absolute power within the German State.
It is a historic fact that on March 23,
1933, the German Centre Party, the poli-
tical organ of the German Catholic com-
munity, voted for the Enabling Law
which enabled Hitler to set aside the
Weimar Constitution the Law which
was the single legal basis for the totali-
tarian state which he was to erect.
Even in this matter it is necessary to
be realistic and not to throw about moral
condemnations from a comfortable arm-
chair.
Yet, even when all those things are
said, it remains true that the Social
Democrats stuck to their guns and voted
against the Enabling Law to the last. The
Catholic Centre Party did not. It voted
for the Enabling Law. Lurthermore, the
reasons which motivated the leadership
of the Centre Party, under Monsignor
Kaas, to make this decision seem to have
been unworthy and, in the last resort,
foolish. The evidence indicates that the
Centre Party made its judgment very
largely on the basis that a vote for the
Enabling Law was the best way to de-
fend the sectional interests of the Catho-
lic Church. Yet the Centre Party was a
political party of the German State. It
had a responsibility to the entire German
people, not merely to the Catholic section
of that people.
The German Catholics were left to
make their own decision. There is no
record that the Holy See attempted to
influence the German bishops to throw
their weight against Hitler at this moment
of time. As far as we can gauge, the Vati-
can simply did not interfere.
Was this standing aside right or wrong?
I believe that it was wrong. But their
action or inaction can only be criticised
by those who believe, as I do, that
bishops have a responsibility even in this
political field.
In making these remarks, I am not
suggesting that the German bishops or
the Pope should have “directed” the
Centre Party. I am merely upholding
what Archbishop Mannix upheld so con-
sistently throughout his life, that a
bishop certainly has the right and often
the duty to speak his mind, as a citizen,
on critical public issues.
In relation to Nazism, the real failure
of Catholicism lies in that particular
event, not in the dubious judgment passed
by Hochhuth on Pius XII.
This audience may find it strange if
I conclude by emphasising that this
failure of German Catholics in relation
to Nazism has been a significant factor
in the political life of this country. I be-
long to a group of Australian Catholics
who, for more than 20 years, but particu-
larly in the 15 years which have passed
since the Communist conquest of China,
have been engaged in a no-holds-barred
struggle against Communist power in
Australia. This is not the time or the
place to examine the analysis of Austra-
lia's position on which we base the neces-
sity of our struggle. We believe that with-
in relatively few years the independence
of Australia will be threatened by reason
of the pressures exerted by Communist
China on every South-East Asian coun-
try, including Australia and New Zea-
land. The gravest but not the only prob-
lem which arises for Australia’s security
stems from two associated facts —firstly,
that the affiliated trade unions control
the Labor Party, and, secondly, that
Communist and extreme Left influence is
strong in the unions.
Lofty irrelevaneies
A LL that I will say is that that is how we
see Australia's problem; that we be
lieve the totalitarian threat to be no less
mordant because it is a Communist rather
than a Nazi totalitarianism which we con-
front; that the one important issue is to
prevent the weapons of political power
from falling into the hands of any Aus-
tralian party which might ultimately “do
a deal” with the Communist power in
the Pacific; that protests afterwards may
be highly moral but will certainly be
utterly unavailing.
Lor these reasons we chose deliberately
to fight on in conditions of considerable
difficulty because we do not want history
to judge us as it has judged the German
Catholics.
In this struggle our fate has not been
singularly different from that of those
German Catholics who to their credit
did want the Centre to resist Hitler and
who withdrew from political life when
their advice was rejected. Being unwilling
to settle for such lofty irrelevaneies as
“State Aid” to Catholic schools, or such
low irrelevaneies as parliamentary posi-
tions for Catholic politicians, or high
positions in the public service, or for
status in society for those members of
the Catholic community who believe that
this should be the ultimate in Catholic
endeavor, we have sustained considerable
unpopularity in the Catholic community,
even with some of its leaders. If we stick
to our guns today, despite all of our
difficulties, not the least consideration
which animates us is that more than 30
years ago most German Catholics mis-
read the signs of the times. It would be
as fatal in this country as it was in Ger-
many to postpone action until the
moment when everybody agreed that the
danger is real. Lor everybody will not be
agreed until it is too late.


Letters to the Editor
The Arab Boycott
Sir,
With reference to comments published
in The Bulletin on September 19,
under "Plain English'’ on the Arab boy-
cott measures, I would like to point out
the following:
1. The Arab boycott is not a vindic-
tive or aggressive measure, as Zionism
claims. In fact, it is a preventive and de-
fensive measure because it safeguards the
security of the Arab countries against
Zionist infiltration, and because it repels
Zionist capital from gaining control over
the Arab economy to serve Zionist im-
perialistic ambitions.
2. The Arab boycott is not based on
racial or religious grounds. It is not at
all directed against any Jew of any nation-
ality. It is directed basically against
Israel and everyone that contributes to
the establishment of its aggressive in-
tentions — military or economic, even if
this one is Christian or Moslem. Nothing
can prove this more than the fact that
the Arab countries trade with Jewish-
owned firms which did not take the side
of Israel, while they refused to trade
with some foreign firms owned by Mos-
lems or Christians because they had com-
mitted actions that helped in strengthen-
ing Israel’s economy and war potential
and displayed bias for Israel.
3. The Arab boycott apparatus defies
world Zionism to mention the name of
one firm boycotted by the Arab countries
merely for being Jewish-owned.
4. Boycott is a legitimate weapon that
does not contravene international law, as
the Arab countries are still in a state of
war with Israel. Armistice in all its forms
puts an end to fighting, but not to the
state of war.
5. The Arab countries are anxious not
to harm the interests of foreign firms
and their shareholders. When they learn
of a trade relation between Israel and
certain firms, they contact these firms to
investigate the nature of this relation.
If it proves to be within the limits of
pure trading, then the case is concluded
and no boycott measures are taken. In
case the relation is of a nature that would
strengthen Israel’s economy or war poten-
tial and serve its aggressive expansionist
ambitions, the Arab countries inform
the firm concerned of the harms this
relation will bring on Arab interests, and
that the Arab countries are in a state
of war with Israel. They also inform the
firm that their laws prevent any trading
with it and leave the choice to it, be-
tween dealing with the Arabs, provided
that it severs its relations with Israel, or
to cease trading with the Arabs and con-
tinue its dealings with Israel.
6. The Arab boycott of Israel is not
an invention of the Arab countries, be-
cause Western countries, particularly the
USA, have taken similar measures, if
not extreme and severe ones, as they have
imposed severe restrictions on trade with
People’s China and countries of the East-
ern bloc. The USA applies the rule of
boycotting foreign firms and
tions trading with these countries. It has
also applied this rule on many firms
which belong to allied countries such as
Britain and Japan and even neutral coun-
tries such as Switzerland. The USA has
applied boycott in its severest form on
Cuba and has lately prevented ships
carrying goods to Cuba from stopping
at American ports, claiming that Cuba
presents a threat to US safety and secu-
rity.
It is indeed peculiar that sources who
did not disapprove of the above-mention-
ed rules and measures as a national
necessity would claim now that the Arab
boycott is illegitimate and unjustified.

Decimal Coins
Sir,
Australians should be appalled at the
manner in which Sir Robert Menzies dis-
missed the recent plea by Church leaders
for our new decimal coins to bear the
inscription “Elizabeth II by the Grace of
God”. It is most disconcerting to find
that his antagonists failed to perceive
the folly in Sir Robert’s erroneous claim
that there was insufficient room for such
a truly meaningful inscription.
Since 1909 our American allies have
found even their tiny “one cent” coin
has more than adequate space to carry
these words: “In God We Trust, Liberty,
E. Pluribus Unum, One Cent, United
States of America” so Sir Robert must
be chastised for his futile attempt to
cover up the oversight of our six “expert”
coin designers, who spent more than
twelve months designing the six artistic
reverse sides which contain no words
whatsoever.

A Private University?
Sir,
The lack of diversity in Australian ter-
tiary education is well known. The ter-
tiary student must specialise in three or
four “subjects”—each of which is ap-
proached in a narrow, vocational manner.
A broad, liberal education is not offered
in any Australian university.
In such a situation is it possible that
the establishment of a small, private uni-
versity might be a worthwhile experi-
ment? Such a university might be model-
led somewhat along the lines of an
American liberal arts college, where most
students encounter a dozen or more
different “subjects” and make some effort
to integrate what they learn. This kind
of curriculum attempts to develop the
student’s mind, imagination and sensi-
tivity, instead of feeding him a steady
diet of uncorrelated “facts”. In other
words, it is liberal education rather than
vocational training.
Are there readers who share our inter-
est in such a venture? If so, we would
like to have their views. Letters will be
appreciated from prospective students,
from parents or lecturers, or from any
interested worrier about Australian edu-
cation. Please write to: Box 15, 37 Glen
St, Milson's Point, NSW.

Tobey and Fairweather
Sir,
If S. J. Prince (19/9/64) wishes to
decide on the merits of my art criticism
from a purely academic viewpoint, and
he says—“an academician might main-
tain that this is a logical outcome of the
art it is attempting to describe”, I take
it he cannot accept the art either. How-
ever, an academician, if he is to profess
any claim to logical thought, would also
acquaint himself with the facts. In this
case these take the form of Fairweather's
paintings. Does he claim to have seen
them? No. If he had he would at once
notice a number of influences absorbed
into their present form. Chinese art
is one. What is so terribly confounding
about a kind of directness reminiscent of
a Persian decorator which one might
also notice? I could and have in past
reviews named others, Aboriginal art,
for instance. The important point here
is an eclecticism of approach but at the
same time one dominated by Fair-
weather's personality, his artistic person-
ality if you like.
Tobey spent years in the Far East and
absorbed the lessons of Chinese calli-
graphy. He claims much for his accept-
ance of Baha’i philosophy as an influ-
ence in his art. The basis, however, of
his technique has not necessarily been
absolutely changed through this, just as
Fairweather’s continued interest in Chi-
nese philosophy does not automatically
wipe ofif the other, purely artistic influ-
ences. Mr Prince may like things to be
nice and tidy, but life is apt to be
different.
The facts here indicate that philosophy
is not painting, nor does the acceptance
of a belief find full expression in art,

flict with the other, that Fairweather’s
arabesques “spring from conscious re-
collection”. Fairweather uses ara-
besques, of course, but as a focal point
in his painting. What comes out is not
only line but tones, colors, textures,
which together, it seems to me, produce
an impression of what Picasso described.
No one who paints, or for that matter
engages in any creative activity, would
claim to be fully conscious of every
aspect of what happens, or to know
exactly the content of that which he
tries to form.
“A kind of authority of statement” is
a reference to an artistic statement
backed by experience, knowledge, vision
or what have you—what is so incom-
prehensible about that? Mr Prince’s
dismissal of “the whole wretched busi-
ness”, “a collection of meaningless
statements masquerading in the guise of
serious art criticism”, will have to be
qualified by a serious study of the art he
offhandedly dismisses if he wishes him-
self to be taken seriously.

"Student Nihilism”
Sir,
The differences between Vincent Buck-
ley (8/8/64) and Neville Langdon
(22/8/64) make interesting reading, but,
at present, the point at issue is not clearly
defined. While agreeing with Mr Buck-
ley’s criticism of “Honi Soit”, it is not
clear to me what he means by his charge
of “student nihilism”. This could be
clarified by quoting examples of it in the
last three years.
But, further, what does Mr Langdon
mean when he talks about “the explora-
tion of a world of personal relations
based on utter honesty” and “It seems
to us that the official world of which he
(Buckley) is a part is generating such
pressures below the surface that a mani-
acal holocaust of some kind is inevit-
able”? It sounds all right, but what it
means, only Mr Langdon, I expect,
knows.
Then, to add to the fog, N. Jackson
(12/9/64), in supporting Mr Buckley,
writes: “Mr Buckley condemns his own
generation even more than the students’
generation”. This seems to put N. Lang-
don back into the picture. Where do we
go from here?
What is to prevail? “Maturity and
humility” or “adolescent and sententious
arrogance” blended with “utter honesty”?

Wildlife Exports
Sir,
“Major Mitchell” cannot know that
space permitted you to print only the
first quarter of my letter (15/8/64). The
other three-quarters gave chapter and
verse for the first quarter. I would not
have written at all had I not believed
that “Bye Bye Birdie” (4/7/64) was in-
tended to be an up-to-the-minute account
of the wildlife export business in this
State. If there is no “doubt as to whether
any particular reference was to past or
present circumstances” (“Major Mitch-
ell”, 5/9/64), I can only say that “Major
Mitchell” either has concealed relevant
information or was ignorant of it. For
example, “the sub-committee of the
Government - appointed body which ad-
vises” (my italics note the present
tense) “on fauna matters” was dissolved
two years ago and the body itself recon-
structed with largely new personnel. I
gave other examples also which suggest
that “Major Mitchell” is unaware of re-
cent developments and appears to mis-
understand some of those of the past. If
he cares to get in touch with me I will
be glad to discuss the whole matter with
him, because I sympathise with his point
of view and agree with his conclusion,
and I am sure he will be happy to learn
that things are not as bad in South
Australia as he seemed to think.

Mussolini and Marriage
Sir,
In his review of Sir Ivone Kirk-
patrick’s “Mussolini’’ (29/8/64), Mr
Malcolm Ellis states that Mussolini
“eschewed marriage—the woman who
lived devoted to him, forgiving his infi-
delities, he never married in the conven-
tional sense”.
On page 244 of the book Kirkpatrick
writes: “Before leaving the pregnant years
1925 and 1926 one domestic event in
Mussolini’s life must be recorded. On
29 December, 1925, he was married to
Rachele in the Milanese church of San
Pietro in Sala. It was a private cere-
mony and the witnesses were his brother
Arnaldo and his principal private secre-
tary Paolucci de’Calboli . . . Rachele, as
usual, was prepared to do whatever her
lord required:
‘Towards the end of 1925 Benito
insisted on our going through the reli-
gious marriage ceremony. To me our
deep attachment to each other, the
fact that we had stood together as one
in our stormy life and above all our
children were a firmer bond than any
convention. But I readily agreed to
consecrate our union in the sight of
God’.”
Mr Ellis, in writing his own nutshell
condemnation of Mussolini, has fallen
into the error for which in former re-
viewers he has castigated an eminent aca-
demic historian —the error of gross
factual inaccuracy.

REVIEWS
BALLET AND OPERA
The Frustrations of Mr Us
By JOHN SMALL
Aurora’s Wedding. Prince Igor.
Roundelay. Elizabethan Theatre
Trust Ballets. Elizabethan Theatre,
Newtown, Sydney.
Catulli Carmina and The Wise
Woman. Carl Orff. Elizabethan
Theatre, Newtown, Sydney.
The second ballet programme of the
current Trust season consisted of
two works by masters of decorative bal-
let, “Aurora's Wedding” by Petipa and
“Prince Igor” by Fokine, and a new
work, “Roundelay”, by Ray Powell, with
music by the West Australian composer
James Penberthy. The best feature of
“Roundelay'’ was Ray Powell’s perform-
ance as Mr Us, the little man whose
hopes and ambitions are continually
being thwarted by the other people in his
world.
Powell's performance was in its way
as distinguished as those of the two
stars of “Aurora’s Wedding”, Kathleen
Gorham and Garth Welch. Powell's
creation of this character was radically
different in style, however, from that of
the more “classical'’ dancers. The tech-
niques used belonged more to mime than
to the classical ballet tradition. Within
this framework Mr Us emerged as one
of the most engaging characters put on
the ballet stage by an Australian choreog-
rapher.
Powell's dancing was admirably com-
plimented by well-disciplined and well-
thought-out work by the. rest of the
ensemble. However, Penberthy’s score
was a distinct liability; it was more an
imitation of various kinds of music than
a composition in its own right.
“Aurora’s Wedding” and “Prince Igor”
were successful within the narrowly cir-
cumscribed limits of this kind of ballet.
“Prince Igor’s” value as a spectacle was
rather diminished by its having to be
staged in a space to small for it. How-
ever, both of these works were present-
ed with a stylishness in general produc-
tion and dancing that more than justifies
the Trust's expensive support of ballet.
One of the most interesting figures
in the generation of composers who
achieved prominence between the world
wars is Carl Orff, whose “Catulli Car-
mina” and “The Wise Woman” are
among the works presented by the Eliza-
bethan Trust. This isn't to say that Orff's
music has much intrinsic merit. Despite
his wide popularity, he is undoubtedly
one of the less-important contemporary
composers. What is interesting about
him is the way in which his music is
typical of the time that produced it.
During the twenties and thirties, most
go-ahead composers were, in their
various ways, rebelling against the nine-
teenth-century tradition. Now that the
smoke has cleared, most of the rebels
can be seen to have been more or less
firmly attached to that tradition. Indeed,
what is best about the music of some
of them is its old-fashioned aspect.
Orff illustrates the obverse of this last
point: his music’s deficiency is its lack
of old-fashioned virtues. Of all the rebels
he was one of the most single-minded.
Confronted by the aims and techniques
of the successors of Wagner, and faced
with the alternatives of accepting or re-
jecting, Orff impaled himself with much
force and little elegance on the second
horn of the dilemma. His solution to
the problems of his time was to reject,
as far as possible, all the elements that
went to make up music, or, more par-
ticularly, the music of his immediate pre-
decessors, and regress to a kind of
musical primitivism featuring insistent
rhythms and exiguous melody and
harmony. (Stravinsky calls Orff's music
“neo-Neanderthal”.)
Tn a way, Orff’s reaction was historic-
ally correct. The development of
music this century has largely been a
matter of getting rid of the preconcep-
tions that underlie the music of the nine-
teenth and earlier centuries. Orff, how-
ever, had nothing to replace these
preconceptions. His attitude to the prob-
lems of composition consists merely of
a kind of truculence towards the
immediate past.
The limitations of Orff's musical
language give rise to expressive limita-
tions as well. His music is crude without
being effective, and this is his greatest
weakness as a composer for the stage.
It is not the case, as one critic
suggested, that the repetitiveness of Orff’s
music slows down the action. Rather,
the points of repose in the plot of an
opera—the arias, ensembles, etc. —need
to justify their existence on the grounds
of dramatic and musical strength, which
the set pieces in “The Wise Woman” are
incapable of doing. To put it crudely,
the plot of “The Wise Woman” does
not move any more slowly than the plots
of most other operas Orff’s music is
just unable to make it seem to move fast.
“The Wise Woman” has an entertain-
ing plot, and its libretto has some
effective touches, such as the onstage
band (kept in the orchestra pit in this
production) and the drinking scene and
subsequent fight. These make it a work
worth seeing, despite its intrinsic limita-
tions and a lacklustre production.
“Catulli Carmina,” which is rather
more serious in aim, is staged much
more effectively. It is, however, not
altogether a show for those who admire
Catullus’ verse—there is too little con-
gruity between the words and the music.

“Tust for Openers” is a selection of
** the opening songs delivered with
unconquerable zest and assurance by
Miss Garland before the weekly epi-
sodes of her show, doomed to a short
life on American television. Some songs
show the star in her least attractive,
hectic and shrill mood, notably “Jam-
boree Jones”—particularly hideous —and
an ill-advised foray into martial en-
thusiasm, “Battle Hymn of the Republic”.
But in “I Wish You Love” the wobbly,
heartfelt, raw voice is at its most power-
fully moving. Genius flashes through the
banal lyrics transforming them into a
warm and triumphant poetry.
To move to Peggy Lee (what, again?)
is to move from a wounded neurotic
to a calm, cool machine. Flawless and
at times virtually expressionless, Miss
Lee's is a voice of the kind electronic
brains may one day produce after being
trained to memorise the lyrics. Every
phrase slithers out of her throat, wraps
itself around the microphone, and leaves
a smooth, consoling echo in the ear.
Miss Lee’s trouble is that she is so
effortless, and so easy to hear, she is
doomed to become a mere supplier of
background music: Miss Muzak.
That is a danger, too, with Frank
Sinatra: the insolent, casual slickness


of the most famous of pop voices never
really captures and holds the attention
to the exclusion of one’s other pleasures.
On his new Capitol release, the dash,
the energy, the hedonistic exuberance
are there, but the technique tends to
flatten out the emotion. This singing is
the work of a man who has stopped car-
ing, and who can no longer make us
care.
“Oliver Twist”, agreeably read by
James Mason, should yield a good deal
of pleasure to those who prefer cut
versions of the text, unaffectedly
delivered, above the full-scale, actorish
transcriptions loaded with BBC voices
we get from across the water. Lawrence
Rosenthal's score for “Becket” is rather
appropriate for the film it graces, if that
is the word: slightly pretentious, over-
decorative, and lacking in a really
dynamic impetus. Before Mr Rosenthal
composes for an epic again, he would
do well to listen to the late Erich Korn-
gold’s score for “Robin Hood”, a model
of vigorous film music.
RCA’s “Great Bands of Our Time” is
a bumper package of the best swing and
jazz, or quasi- jazz, of the period between
the wars and the early 1940 s (with one
rather odd intrusion from Gene Krupa,
recorded in 1951). Among the outstand-
ing items are Lena Horne’s beautifully
throaty and exultant “You’re My Thrill”
(recorded with Charlie Barnet in 1941);
the 1934 Ray Noble-Al Bowlly “The
Very Thought of You”, so wisely copied
by Ray Heindorf in his arrangements
for “Casablanca”; Bunny Berigan’s
irreplaceable “High Society” (with Joe
Bushkin on piano and Ray Conniff
later a slick bandleader—on trombone).
It all brings the 'thirties back with splen-
did vividness. My only quibble would be
that the jazz and the non-jazz are rather
indiscriminately mixed together on both
sides.

England’s Artefacts
Three Exhibitions for British Fort-

Qf these three special exhibitions, that
of English domestic silver (1660-
1910) is by far the most comprehensive.
(There are 92 items.) “English Artist
Potters”, represented by a modest 16,
consists largely of an exhibition of photo-
graphs, while Young British Painters are
introduced to us through 23 of their
works.
Visitors to London usually seem to

Victoria and Albert Museum in favor of
the more glamorous National Gallery.
ae V and A has a magnificent treasure
trove, from which this silverware dis-
play was selected.
Everywhere in it one sees refinement
of proportion, elaborated by the English
craftsman’s characteristic taste for tell-
ingly individual detail. Not that the
shapes, tankards, cups, candlesticks,
sconces, castors, bowls, tureens and the
like are not often robust, solid and en-
during, but here they reflect the cultured
taste of patrons who knew exactly what
they were paying for.
Stuart Restoration pieces could be
breathtakingly simple essays in purely
functional design. More decorated forms
never seem to lose this sense of design
despite the strong influence of late
Baroque styles from across the Channel.
Queen Anne, Georgian and Regency
classic alternately charm or surprise even
when the goldsmiths appear to be called
upon to produce near sculpture. Rococo
asymmetry vies with a host of antique
recollections to produce a revival worthy
of the past.
Even the Victorian love of natural
detail finds engaging expression here.
Gothic revivalism, the Arts and Crafts
movement and Art Nouveau found not-
able exponents who, though amateurs to
a degree, sustained the craft well into
the age of mass production.
“Young British” paintings on
loan through the Calouste Gulben-
kian Foundation and the British Council
supplemented with 12 from Australian
collections cannot purport to be a sur-
vey. Compared with the US show here
earlier this year they appear quiet, re-
served and tactful, with some touches of
fey humor. Hard edge paintings by John
Hoyland and Robyn Denny are well con-
trolled, colorful expositions of impersonal
geometry, whose scale is calculated to
impress (rather than the content).
Pop-ists Hockney and Harold Cohen
draw heavily on folk banalities to employ
their wit, the one with deliberate primi-
tivisms, the other with the dea.d-pan
flatness of a signwriter. As a corollary,
both suck into their paintings a large
measure of the vacuity and boredom of
commercial art.
Henry Mundy, lan Stephenson and Joe
Tilson gently pursue diverse paths in the
broad stream of abstraction in which
only John Forrester seems to be looking
towards Spain. Apart from Phillip Sut-
ton’s anglicised versions of Matisse and
the earlier work of kitchen sinkers
Middleditch and Bratby, most of the
seventeen painters here have cast more
than one long glance across the Atlantic
before developing their own lyrical ver-
sions of post-expressionist art.
Some superb pots by Bernard Leach,
Michael Cardew, and Lucie Rie elucidate
the diverse qualities of English master
potters at their best. All seem to be in-
debted to the Japanese, yet one is re-
minded as well of the centuries-old tradi-
tions they grew up in and which the
studio potters almost alone continue to
augment.

Panic in Year Zero. Director, Ray Mil-
land. Recently at Capitol Theatre,
Sydney.
“/Captain Newman m.d.”, a soothing,
capable film, is ideal fare for anyone
with a hangover. Since I had been cold
sober before I saw it I found it merely
soporific.
Eminently nice, it’s a film without a
villain. Dedicated Captain Newman is
the doctor in charge of the psychiatric
section of a military hospital. He and
everybody else in the picture is so decent
it hurts. Some of the mad (or “emotion-
ally disturbed”) patients occasionally
behave badly, and there’s a brusque CO,
but all turn out to be good at heart.
Newman (played by Gregory Peck
at his most stodgily noble) is a regular
dab at figuring out what’s fussing his
patients, but the gallant captain's cures
often seem worse than the disease. Of
his three star cases, one commits suicide
and another recovers sufficiently to be
sent back into action and killed. How-
ever, the third survives to be reunited
with his chilly, patrician wife.
But at least Captain Newman has
unearthed the cause of their troubles
guilt and the film ends at Christmas
in a glow of goodwill which even extends
to the comic Italian POWs.
David Miller’s direction, succumbing
to the prevailing amiable somnolence, is
capable but dull except for a lively,
irrelevant sequence when some sheep get
loose on an airstrip. Here for a few
moments, Miller and the whole film
really wake up.
Tony Curtis, Eddie Albert, Robert
Duvall and Angie Dickenson stroll
through the proceedings with off-hand
competence.
In “Panic in Year Zero” Ray Milland
has overcome that compulsion to be
original at all costs which made his
direction of “The Thief” so obtrusively
tricksy. His new story of the survivors
of an atomic attack is presented in a
straightforward, workmanlike way.
Scenes showing the breakdown of civil-
ised living and the crumbling of accept-
ed standards of behavior are treated
crisply; Milland is less at ease with the
moral homilies inflicted on him by a
cliche-ridden scriptwriter. In this neat,
minor film Ray Milland, already a not-
able actor, shows recognisable promise
as a director.

POETRY
The Ecology of Fishes
Coming late to a study of ecology
I have learnt about the corrugated skin of sea-horses
Who abrade themselves constantly on the harsh
branches of sea-shrubs appearing
Very like branches themselves.
And certain fish disguise themselves as shadows over
sand, passing without comment
Over the striped sea-floor. Others
Glide with a variable, sinuous movement, resembling
The faint demarcation of ripple and current,
Lacking the rigidity of pattern, as the lines of a
poem may waver and tremble
Endeavoring the fluidity of fish.
Fish, it is said,
Cannot survive unless they adapt themselves to their
environments,
And certain environments will not survive unless
they are inhabited
By ecologically
Knowledgeable
Fish.
Am I not subject for a similar ecological case-history?
Striped like my kitchen floor with sunlight and
shadow,
I stand by the sink and my fingers shoot forth tea-
spoons
As the light rays out from the silver sides of
canisters.
I am admirably adapted to the shape required for
comforting children,
I am perfectly evolved in length, breadth, and colora-
tion to suit my environment,
Can it be true then —is it ecologically logical
That my environment would not survive without me?
ROSEMARY DOBSON
One Eureka
So mourn the richness that we did not know:
Some company of brothers in a land
That needed us, living, dead or banned,
And never alone; and it is too late now.
We were not an intimate country; large,
We lost all unity and had no cause,
No love or quarrel with ourselves but wage
Of these from others’ loyalties and wars.
How often has Eureka died since then
Those generations buried on wrong shores
And honored as saviors but not sovereign.
So round the wreaths and flames our silence stores
Their going forth, their darker no-return,
Their absence in their robbed and native earth.
But mourn the memory that we shall not burn
Warmly in the right grave of our birth.
And here of time or place point none to say,
“There, and there, we stood and failed or won,
And doing either gained a name that day.”
We have no kinship; there was nothing done.
DAVID ROWBOTHAM
Loneliness
. . lama sabachthani"
It is the grave
Where men waste in death
With no heaven or love,
Memory or a wreath;
No one knows they are dead,
Only the place to which they steal
To sit, hands on head,
Feeling their burial:
The room lit
With the lamp that thought
Soon pinches out,
The corner of the street
Where the men reach
Strangeness to themselves
Being meaningless to each,
And the tree that dissolves
Shadeless over decay:
And from this, on the third
Or any day
That heaps the solitude,
There can be no rising;
Even he, beloved most,
Who cried loneliness more surprising
With that gave up the ghost.
DAVID ROWBOTHAM
Roast, but no meat
A souffle poem, so light, I send and he
Rejects and says “a fragment not a whole”.
Again I try and hope that it will be
As fresh as salad in a garlic bowl.
Rejection this time shows it needs more form
And why not try my hand at good plain roast
He bids me stir and get a sonnet born.
I think of all the dishes I can boast.
From international cuisines he can choose,
From Spain paella, snails from France in sauce
And Tundoor chick, each with appropriate booze.
But horse to water more I cannot force.
I give up hope of pleasing him, and sigh
Our ways must part no good plain cook am I.
DOROTHY NAGRATH
The Invaders
For all we can tell they rode upon asses.
An ass no doubt has a kind of dignity
the sidesaddle brigand, debtor to harvest
with grain in each dangling boot.
Or they might have advanced in bullock carts,
stacking their weapons and loot inside,
lounged with insolent bone-shaken comfort -
spitting at dusty strangers.
They might never have owned such beasts at all,
nor even the poorest of waggons or saddles
(just goats for milking, for meat in camp),
no caravan wealth, no silk.
But we with our sympathies mount them on horse-
back
—in fear as in love demanding vitality
deck them and bead them with black leather helmets
and whip them to nightmare speed.

Peeping Tom at Versailles
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
Memoirs of the Due de Saint-Simon.
Edited by W. H. Lewis. Batsford.
275. (Paperback, 18s. 9d.)
Louis de Rouvroy, Due de Saint-
Simon, must have been a singularly
unlikeable person. On the evidence of his
own writings he was malicious, small-
minded, snobbish and vain to a degree
of absurdity hardly credible. He was a
toady, a snooper and a tale-bearer.
Scabrous gossip was to him the breath
of life. His Memoirs are the apotheosis
of the What The Butler Saw tradition.
As literature they are negligible. As
history their importance has often been
considerably overrated. Yet, for more
than 200 years, they have been re-edited,
reprinted and translated into every
European language, fascinating historian
and general reader alike while the
accounts of much more reliable contem-
porary witnesses, Torcy, for instance,
have sunk into dusty oblivion.
The fact is, of course, that we do not
open the pages of Saint-Simon to be in-
structed in history or to savor the prose
of France’s literary Augustan age. We
turn to the Memoirs to play Peeping
Tom at the court of Versailles, to pry
into the private lives of those glittering
creatures who went through their rigid,
etiquette-ruled evolutions round the per-
son of King Louis XIV. But for Saint-
Simon, it is unlikely that posterity would
ever have known that Madame de
Montespan (in her latter days of repen-
tance) mortified her flesh by wearing a
girdle armed with iron points, that the
Duke of Orleans tried to raise devils in
the quarries of Vaugirard, that half of
the Duke of Vendome's nose was eaten
away by syphilis, or that the Sun King
himself sweated so much under his
feather bolsters that he had to be
rubbed down like a horse before his
ministers paid their morning respects.
Saint-Simon, who was born in 1675,
lived through an age when France was
outwardly at the height of her glory.
Louis XIV was the embodiment of
Richelieu’s ideal of a national monarch,
ruling absolutely with the aid of efficient
bourgeois bureaucrats and reducing the
factious old nobility to the status of mere
court ornaments. France was by far the
richest and most populous country in
Rie Western world. French taste and
rench armies dominated Europe. Yet
the canker of decay was already there
and not even Saint-Simon could be
hnd to the fearful price of la gloire—
the endless wars that turned France into
a vast hospital and left a legacy of
economic misery and financial chaos that
swept the country irresistibly through-
out the 18th century towards revolution.
Saint-Simon’s solution for France's
troubles was simple. He hated the “men
of the robe”—the lawyers of the
Parlement, the financiers, administrators
and other middle-class upstarts who,
under the king’s theory of government,
had usurped the influence once wielded
by the nobility. He wanted to revive the
good old days when aristocrats like him-
self had been the monarch’s natural
counsellors. The terrors of the Fronde
had taught King Louis what it meant to
allow too much power to the seigneurial
houses. Saint-Simon had learnt nothing
from recent history; he saw only the
degradation, folly and viciousness into
which the aristocracy degenerated when
Louis reduced them to the role of
glorified lackeys at his court.
Ane of Saint-Simon’s most famous set
pieces describes his momentary
triumph when, after the king’s death, the
Parlement was forced to accept the un-
controlled regency of the Duke of Or-
leans: “This was the moment when I re-
lished, with a delight utterly impossible to
express, the sight of those lawyers
prostrated upon their knees . . . My eyes
fixed, glued, upon those haughty
bourgeois, humiliated to the level of our
feet, the ample robes of rabbit-skin that
would imitate ermine waving at each
long and redoubled genuflexion ... I
was dying with joy. I was so oppressed
that I feared I should swoon . . .”
There is another revelation of Saint-
Simon’s intellectual calibre when he dis-
cusses with the Regent the advisability of
convening the States-General. In the
midst of this constitutional crisis Saint-
Simon has only one concern: Will peers
of the rank of duke be allowed to keep
their hats on when the votes are being
counted? Precedence squabbles were al-
ways matters of burning interest to Saint-
Simon and he recorded them in minute
detail. Typical was the incident when the
Princess d’Harcourt, “a tall, fat creature
with a complexion like milk-porridge”,
seized the Duchess de Rohan in her arms
and forcibly hauled her from her chair
in the royal salon.
In fairness to Saint-Simon it must be
said that his obsession with these triviali-
ties was not entirely due to personal
arrogance. It was a vital part of his
political theory that the upper ranks of
the nobility should never surrender a
jot of the respect due to their titles.
Louis XIV could not live forever and,
as death swept away his immediate heirs,
it. was likely that his great-grandson
would succeed to a long tutelage under
the regency of the Duke of Orleans.
Despite the infamous character of
Orleans, Saint-Simon courted him assidu-
ously in the king’s last years in the illu-
sory belief that the Regent shared his
hopes and sympathies. But the busy,
inquisitive, intriguing Saint-Simon was
soon as unpopular with Orleans as he
had been with the old king. His dreams
dashed, he sentenced himself to banish-
ment from the ungrateful court. He
lived on in complete obscurity for
another 30 years, outliving both his sons.
The ducal title of which he was so proud
died with him in 1755.
When he is discoursing upon politics
Saint-Simon is grossly partisan, fre-
quently inaccurate and sometimes merely
tedious. The Memoirs owe their peren-
nial appeal to his extraordinary picture
of everyday life at the French court
between 1695 and 1725. It is not a
consciously-wrought picture. Saint-Simon
was not a satirist, concerned with whip-
ping, vice and folly. He simply set down
what he saw and heard and added his
own shrewdly spiteful comments. He
could toss off a memorable phrase—like
his denunciation of Monseigneur the
Dauphin “drowned in fat and sloth”, or
in his description of the death-bed of
Monsieur, the king's brother, when the
femmes galantes of the palace of Saint-
Cloud “ran here and there, crying, with
dishevelled hair, like Bacchantes”. Or
his vignette of the frivolous old Comtesse
de Fiesque, who sold the last remnant of
her estates to buy a mirror for her
apartments at Fontainebleau. “I had a
miserable piece of land which yielded me
only corn,” she explained. “Who would
hesitate between corn and this beautiful
mirror?”
But Saint-Simon’s most justly celebra-
ted passages are his portraits of
Louis XIV and the Regent Orleans. Of
Louis’ egotism, extravagance and blind-


ness to the condition of his country we
have ample evidence from other sources.
Saint-Simon fills in a thousand vivid
details of his daily life, from the time his
valet scrubs his gouty, sweaty body in the
morning until a courtier hands him his
embroidered night-shirt at midnight. We
see Le Roi Soleil conducting State busi-
ness in the boudoir of Madame de Main-
tenon, while the royal mistress sews dis-
creetly and occasionally offers sensible
advice; we see him supervising the fan-
tastic aqueducts and cascades of Marly,
gorging himself on pastries in his hunt-
ing coach, taking medicine once a week,
ordering an even more costly round of
masques and festivals to offset the
gloomy tidings of Blenheim. The king
removed his hat with exquisite courtesy
to the humblest dairymaid in the park,
but, says Saint-Simon, “he was incon-
siderate in more delicate matters and
ladies accompanying him on his long
coach rides often had occasion to curse
him. The Duchess de Chevreuse once
rode all the way from Versailles to
Fontainebleau in such extremity that
several times she well-nigh lost conscious-
ness”.
About life outside the stately cere-
monial of the court, Saint-Simon knew
little and cared less. He had no taste
for art or literature. When he heard of
Racine’s death he commented patroni-
singly: “There was nothing of the poet
in his manners; he had the air of a well-
bred and modest man”. Of a more cele-
brated figure Saint-Simon wrote with
superb condescension: “Arouet, son of a
notary, was exiled and sent to Tulle at
this time for some verses very satirical
and very impudent. I should not amuse
myself by writing down such a trifle if
this same Arouet, having become a great
poet and academician under the name of
Voltaire, had not also become a manner
of personage in the republic of letters,
and even achieved a sort of importance
among certain people.”

none of these novels could
be classed as fantasy they have in
common a nightmarish quality and a hint
of madness. Of the three, Evan Hunter's
“Buddwing” comes closest to reality and
is by far the most readable.
With one exception, Evan Hunter’s
earlier novels have been concerned with
social evils: overcrowded, understaffed
schools (“The Blackboard Jungle”),
drug addiction (“Second Ending”),
adultery (“Strangers Where We Meet”)
and juvenile delinquency (“A Matter of
Conviction”). With “Buddwing”, the story
of a search for identity, he becomes more
introspective.
A man wakes at dawn on a New York
park bench to find that he has no idea
who he is or how he comes to be there.
The only clues to his former existence
are an initialled ring, two movie stubs
and a telephone number. In this “Twi-
light Zone” atmosphere, he ventures into
the city to relive his life in twenty-four
hours up to the unbearable moment that
has cauterised his memory. The adven-
tures and people he encounters in his
compulsive search represent different
stages in his past life and, as the climac-
tic revelation approaches, past and pre-
sent become so tangled as to create a
pathologically confused state in Budd-
wing. Indeed, the fear that he is an
escaped lunatic haunts him throughout
the crowded day.
These incidents offer an excuse for a
series of vignettes of city life and some of
these are beautifully handled: A coffee-
bar sequence with three “Blackboard
Jungle” denizens; a Bacchic romp with a
sailor and two Chinese girls; an early
morning Harlem crap game. Three affairs
with progressively older girls, each of
whom remind him of his wife, ultimately
lead him to the shock which had triggered
his amnesia, information which is care-
fully hidden until the final pages. The
book finishes where it began: a nameless
man waking on a park bench in fact,
the first and last paragraphs are identical.
Buddwing has physically conducted his
own analysis, but one is left wondering
whether a cure has been effected.
Author of seven serious novels and a
number of above-average thrillers written
as Ed Mcßain, Evan Hunter is a
thoroughly professional writer and the
pace and authenticity of his style com-
pensate for a certain lack of depth. Con-
sidering his reputation and his maturity
it is surprising that, in several sequences,
one can all too clearly trace the influences
of J. D. Salinger and Truman Capote.
If Sam Buddwing is mentally disturbed
at times, Thomas Hinde’s hero in “The
Day the Call Came” is right round the
bend from the start to finish. Harry Bale,
who narrates his own story, manages to
appear normal to his family and neigh-
bors; but, as he receives his “orders”
from the mysterious “they” on a trans-
mitter in his attic and by decoding the
flashes of sunlight from car mirrors, we
begin to perceive the extent of his de-
lusions. The most commonplace remarks
and actions seem significant to his de-
ranged mind and, one by one, his closest
friends are suspected of being in league
against him. The elimination of one or
more of them is constantly expected but,
because of the low-key writing and be-
cause the borderline between delusion
and reality is always too clear, there is
little suspense and little feeling of horror
even when he does the deed.
Mr Hinde is an accomplished writer,
noted for his capacity for reticence and
the natural grace of his prose; but some-
times, as in this rather indeterminate
novel, he fails to make contact.
A greater contrast to Mr Hinde’s
terseness than Blanche Bingham’s over-
burdened modern fairy-tale would be
hard to imagine. “The Castle of Thread
and Dust”, with its suffocating Victorian
extravagance, is a book of another, more
leisurely, time. Out of the mass of man-
nered verbiage a touching enough story
finally emerges, but getting to it is an
exhausting process.
Sammy Kappernowski, an ageing Jew
who runs an old-clothes shop in Paris in
the thirties, is befriended by Sophia Vasil-
evna, a fortune-teller who, as much for
her own amusement as out of pity for his
loneliness, invents a girl called Bella
whom she says needs a husband in France
to escape Nazi-invaded Poland. A
hunchback friend contrives to smuggle
a pregnant girl (supposedly “Bella”)
into Paris. To Sammy, the girl's arrival
is a miracle wrought by fairy-godmother
Sophia. When “Bella” dies in childbirth,
Sammy and Sophia are left with the child.
That is a merciless breakdown of the
story: Actually Miss Bingham manages
to inject a little magic into it. Loaded
with conceits though it is, there are un-
deniable moments of beauty in her prose,
many a subtle image polished until it
dazzles. Obviously, this is a book which
has been worked over with loving care.
It is a pity that such a consistently rich
diet causes a glut in the reader. If only
Miss Bingham would occasionally not
call a spade a digging implement!

Subtitled “Some Key Film Makers of

From Hardware stores everywhere tab
availably individual talents working in
the cinema today”.
Each chapter is an independent essay,
though the author is more or less making
an overall point about him. He prefaces
with the old question “If the cinema is
an art, who is the artist?” and deciding in
favor of the director, he concludes that
the real film-artist “creates directly in
terms of film”. All this is sensible, but
no t very new.
He begins well with a chapter on Fel-
lini, though it seems to me he does not
give sufficient emphasis to the remark-
able change in Fellini’s style, or rather,
the sudden gelling of various features
into a consistent, compelling style, first
seen in the episode of “Boccaccio 70”
and appearing fully developed in “8k”.
Of the directors he writes about it is
only Fellini who really seems to interest
him. Here alone does he write persua-
sively. He succeeds in making one want
to see the early films over again, and a
critic can surely be said to have written
well if he does this. Unfortunately, the
rest of the book is not on the same level.
Rightly, he points out that Fellini is
not a “realist with a special gift for social
satire” as so many critics persist in
believing. Instead, he calls him a
“baroque fantasist”; “his forte ... is
symbolic fantasy of almost baroque
elaboration and artificiality”. ’ Where he
is perhaps a little off the mark though
is in his implication that Fellini has
always been guided purely by his own
vision. On the contrary I believe the
weakness of his early films lies in the
fact that he was half-trying to make neo-
realist works, and falling between two
stools. It is only with “Dr Antonio”
that he becomes autonomous.
This is Taylor at his best. With Hitch-
cock he is at his worst. For the early
Hitchcock films he leans heavily on a
book by two French critics, his remarks
being often little more than a paraphrase
of theirs. Some of the films he has
clearly not seen for a long time (if in
fact he ever saw them) and once or twice
he makes a blunder over details of plot
through relying blindly on the French-
men.
What is less excusable, he is even care-
less in discussing more recent films. For
instance, in the notes on “Psycho” he
refers to Marion Crane’s “ingenious”
robbery (she simply took home the
money she was supposed to deposit in
a bank), to “the attack on the intruders”
(there was only one) and so on. Small
points, but they add up to an impression
of hasty, ill-considered writing.
Hitchcock is the subject of a good
deal of critical debate these days. The
rench book mentioned puts forward the
k' evv that the director is a serious, deli-
erate moralist. Wanting to seem au fait
ut unwilling to spend time in studying
ls v ' ew > Taylor compromises by making
liberal use of key phrases like “transfer
of culpability” without properly defining
them. At the same time he adopts an
attitude of uneasy condescension when-
ever referring to it.
It is high time someone provided a
serious, detailed refutation of the case.
Though one cannot really believe in it
(the buffoon of TV appearances a
moralist?), it is by no means too absurd
to be considered.
The chapter on Bunuel is hardly better
than the Hitchcock. Again he makes
the work of an antecedent his mainstay,
this time Ado ICyrou’s hysterically parti-
san book, translated recently into English.
None of Bresson’s films has been
shown commercially in Australia and
only one, “Le Journal dun Cure de
Campagne”, has had any showing at all.
The situation is almost as bad in Bunuel’s
case, but the loss is greater. Next to
Renoir he is probably the most outstand-
ing artist the cinema has yet produced,
yet between the prurience of censors and"
the timidity of distributors only a tiny
handful of his films has penetrated to
this country.
We have been somewhat luckier with
Bergman, owing to the vogue his films
had overseas. Taylor reviews them with
admirable sobriety avoiding the excessive
strictures of the counter-vogue, and con-
eludes that “Wild Strawberries” and
“Smiles of a Summer Night” are still to
be regarded as very fine films. Bergman
on the whole though does not “create
directly in terms of film”, he writes a
script and then directs it. This is an
interesting view, but I suspect a sophis-
tical one.
Of the directors he deals with, Taylor

is clearly, even avowedly, least sympa-
thetic to Resnais. His comments on the
individual films are confused and uncom-
prehending, though, he makes some
generalisations I would not question. He
asserts for instance that Resnais is an
interpreter only. “ ‘Marienbad’ is really
a Robbe-Grillet film with sumptuous
illustrations by Resnais.” He might have
made a similar statement on “Hiroshima,
Mon Amour”, where the illustrations,
however, do not always fit the text.
On Fellini and Bergman then, Taylor
is well worth reading. On Hitchcock,
Bunuel and perhaps Resnais he is better
avoided. On the rest he is just prosaic
and dull.
Still, the book does at least partially
fill a gap. There is a filmography on
each director, and plot summaries of
all films are included in the various
chapters.

My Life and Fortunes. J. Paul Getty.
Allen & Unwin. 51s.
The Memoirs of General Delgado.
Cassell. 535. 9d.
T7or some years J. Paul Getty has been
-*• occasionally mentioned in the Aus-
tralian Press as a publicity-shy multi-
multi-millionaire American. Recently
his photograph appeared in a local news-
paper, because he chose to wear a Beatle
wig at a party, and his autobiography
has been published to disclose to the
world his business history: there is little
else in it about the man whose Tide
Water Oil Company alone has assets of
some 800,000,000 dollars, the man
“Fortune” labelled “The Richest Ameri-
can” in 1957.
J. Paul Getty’s somewhat impersonal
account reminds one of a lengthy report
by a good-natured managing director,
written in that simple style so popular
with readers who like digests. As a
child he saw some of the romantic early
days of oil discovery when Rock Oil, as
it was first called, was being sold as an
Indian Remedy as well as a lighting and
power fuel. His father, George F.
Getty (a self-made man and successful
attorney), had only 250,000 dollars when
he got the oil bug. The first decade of
the 20th century was marked by great oil
strikes and rushes in which George F.
was soon making his first million.
J. Paul was attracted to the rough and
exciting life on the oil fields, working on
the drilling sites during school holidays
and later becoming a prospector and
wildcat operator. He made his first im-
portant strike at the age of 22, in 1915,
when there were 7,000,000 automobiles
in the US and the World War's demand
for oil steadily boosted prices. In his
book he neatly tabulates his increasing
riches, his company formations, the
honorable mentions for the people who
helped him, the prices he paid for his
Ardabil carpet ($68,000) and Rembrandt
($532,000), and, in appendices, the
share purchases in the Tide Water Co.
and the Petroleum Co. of America. His
Journey’s End chapter describes Sutton
Place, the 16th-century manor and
country estate in Surrey, purchased from
the Duke of Sutherland.
General Humberto Delgado, the
exiled Portuguese political opponent of
Dr Salazar, has written his memoirs to
document his charges against the malad-
ministration by the present Government
of his motherland. He describes a
miserable country where an archaic
economy stifles development, where revo-
lution foments as it has for a hundred
years among a people starved for poli-
tical and cultural freedom. The last
major revolt was that of 1926 which
successfully overthrew the government
and allowed Salazar to rise to power.
In the 1958 elections General Delgado
stood, with the sanction of Salazar, as
the Opposition candidate for the office
of President, but when the General
showed signs of seriously competing, and
being concerned with the rigged ballots
and other obstructions to an honest poll,
he found himself ignominiously dis-
charged from the Army and forced
into exile. Since then Salazar has had
a relentless enemy who has travelled
the world seeking sympathy for his
cause and who will use any means to
depose him.
The dramatic seizure of the Santa
Maria by Captain Galvao was inspired
by the efforts of General Delgado, who
also entered Portugal in the same year
(1961) to lead a revolt which failed to
achieve its first objective—the garrison
at Beja. He is a never-say-die patriot
constantly working for the downfall of
Salazar, yet claims that he “knows the
dictator well and holds no personal
grudge against him!”
He describes much detail of the his-
tory of the Portuguese Republicans, en-
livening the account with strong Latin-
emotional comment. One can sympa-
thise with him when he writes of “Our
fair and lovely Portugal, the garden of
Europe set on the shores of the sea”,
but only wonder where he picked up
“With all her faults I love her dearly”.

TYHara chronicles the ordinar
American who comes from, (
might have come from, Gibbsvillt
Pennsylvania, which is close both ge<
graphically and semantically to the re,
town of Pottsville where O’Hara v«
born. O’Hara is to Gibbsville, PA, an
environs, what Faulkner is to Yokn:
patawpha County, Mississippi, but witli
out any of the latter’s dark, broodin;
symbolism. If O’Hara’s characters laci
the depth of Faulkner’s, this is perhap
because Faulkner has become the spokes
man for an area of historical and socio-
logical significance and because of hi
deep sense of personal involvement.
O’Hara’s characters have alway
seemed similar. For the most part, the]!
come from Gibbsville or a nearby are;
of Pennsylvania, and in spite of thei:
heritage are usually liberal in their view
and sexual behavior; they are well-to-di
if not outright rich and attend the riglt
private schools and colleges. As a class'
they are well adjusted to some extent be
cause of their understanding of Freud
and their aberrations are in most case:
the acceptable ones. Mostly they aid
products of the ’twenties, making ther
contemporaries of O'Hara. s

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
In the Copper Belt
i irrTHEN copper surged above £stg44o a ton in London,
is VU breaking the previous price record established in the
i Korean War, producers became very nervous about
it price vulnerability and said they were still making every
cl effort to supply long-term contracts at £stg26o a ton.
P Although the fixed contract price may appear too low when
compared to the open market price, the spot price must
be even more artificial, because it represents a speculative,
li: national trading market dealing in limited supplies.
Critics of the London Metals Exchange quickly hastened
! to condemn this “paper” market as unreal and misleading.
-They suggested that speculators, dealing in commodity
'futures in New York, London and other centres, were
creating grave problems both for producers and users.
j, ; Speculators caught short in supplying metal, or consumers
I who desperately need an urgent supply of metal, some-
iitimes pay ridiculous prices for the trickle of supplies avail-
able on the open market. This disrupts normal suppliers in
id their efforts to maintain contract prices at reasonable levels
®and certainly upsets consumers, who need to plan 12
nmonths ahead.
” Lack of supplies from Communist countries, plus some
steady stockpiling by those who do not like the look of the
fpolitical situations in Malaysia, Vietnam and Cyprus, have
ibeen superimposed on a stock shortage created by strikes
:®t mines in Rhodesia, Chile and the Congo.
1 The producers also have come in for bitter criticism and
'they have been accused of poor forward planning in
ie their inability to foresee the present shortage. Yet, 18
("months ago, producers were wondering glumly where were
'"they going to sell their metal.
f Copper, which has been strong statistically, is currently
3( coming up against a new competitor, aluminium, now being
af Jsed as a substitute in electrical power cable core, with the
advantage of lighter weight and a price which is about
Lstg69 a ton less than the contract copper price of £stg26o
ri i ton.
Looking back in hindsight, market traders, who now
afannot obtain adequate supplies of copper at a reasonable
iei )rice , are castigating producers for not increasing mine
Induction in a period when wage demands and political
rfnrest in Rhodesia and Chile were likely to force a price
th lse - It would have been better if, instead of trying to
support copper prices in 1962 and 1963, the producers had
stockpiled as much copper as possible, so the argument
goes.
The producers, rightly enough, hotly counter this
criticism by pointing out that if they had not kept their
mines going by bolstering the price to £stg234 in those
leaner years, many producers would have gone out of
business and the situation would have been even more
critical today.
It is true that copper producers may need to engage in
better marketing techniques to compete with aluminium
and other substitutes, but it is unfair to claim that copper
is being priced out of the market. The open market price
is not a true indication of the value of the vast majority
of metals, which go straight to users and not through the
metals exchange.
New York observers feel copper supplies could be more
stable since the election of a more conservative Govern-
ment in Chile, which eliminates the fear of mine takeovers
by the Government.
Wall Street Hums Happily
YJL/all Street seems to be in the grip of inflation with
the Dow Jones Averages running up through 872 to a
new peak on September 22. Wage rises, as in Australia,
are all the vogue at the moment and investors are con-
vinced that cost inflation will provide an underpinning for
the stock market.
Increased labor costs in the motor industry are expected
to touch off a round of similar wage increases in other
industries, leading to a consequent lift in prices for manu-
factured goods. As a result, investors are buying into the
stock market as a hedge against inflation.
It is being argued that no restraints will occur during a
Presidential campaign. Market analysts are therefore talk-
ing about a “900” index breakthrough before the end of
1964—a prediction that would have been taken as fool-
hardy earlier this year when doubts were expressed about
piercing the 800 barrier. Tax concessions smothered
those doubts and now it is inflation which is quieting the
doubts about the 900 barrier.
A miscalculation could cause some heartaches, because
industrial production is rising, along with capital expendi-
ture. It seems obvious that the public will need increased
spending capacity to cope with the enlarged flow of goods
at higher prices. It is a small voice that warns that the
present boom is breaking all postwar records.
Tin Leaps Ahead
T ondon sources state that the seasonal demand for tin
which traditionally gathers full momentum only in
September, is being stimulated by delays in deliveries
caused by a miners’ strike in Bolivia and a transport
workers’ strike in Nigeria.
Add to this the labor unrest in the Congo and the poli-

tical problems in the world’s largest producing area,
Malaysia, and it can be seen why buyers are scampering
around for supplies. Yet it wasn’t so many years ago that
tin production was restricted because of over-supply.
The sharp rise in the use of tinplate, which now
accounts for half the usage of tin, is the main reason for
the rising demand.
Some industries have gone heavily into canning, particu-
larly the US beer industry which once traditionally used
bottles. Of course, there is also an increased demand for
canned goods in the under-developed countries.
At the same time, the experts say there has been a switch
in the developed countries from tin cans to frozen packs,
aluminium cans and plastic containers, which has helped
to offset, to some extent, the normal increase in the usage
of tin cans.
The American General Services Administration states it
will not release more than the 20,000 tons of stockpiled
tin which is scheduled for release during the year to
March, 1965. About half of this 20,000 tons already has
been released on to the market, which caused consumers
to complain that the flow of metal from the stockpile will
be insufficient. Hence the buying rush, which forced tin
prices to an 11-year high of £stgl4so a ton.
Within a year, the spot price of tin has jumped by
£stgsos a ton, or 53 p.c. On past experience, suppliers
will be encouraged to cash in on these high prices and
many marginal mines will attempt to take advantage of
such profitable levels. This inevitably suggests a switch to
substitutes and a setback after the seasonal demand wanes.
More Capital Demands Likely
Dhp’s promise of a new issue in 1965 draws further
attention to the possible demands on the capital
issues market before long.
Already the new share issues currently being sought by
Australian public companies total £ 19.5 m., excluding the
NZ Forest issue of £NZI.6m. and the £l.9m. in calls
which will be made on Western Mining’s new issue.
A figure of £19.5m. is not large, particularly when it
is realised that the debenture issue of the finance companies
as a group rake in much more than that in a comparable
period of time.
But, with semi-government demands, Commonwealth
loan subscriptions, debenture raisings and now a rising
trend in capital issues, the investor is likely to be asked to
dig deep. For some shareholders a capital issue will be a
pleasure, as they feel the recent trend was to by-pass them
when new funds were sought. As a result, they have not
enjoyed the growth benefits they hoped for . . . and paid
for when they bought their investments.
Nevertheless, they will be anxious to see that premiums
on new issues are kept down to a reasonable level and that
directors do not avoid them by making private share
placements.
One Way with “Invisibles” ~
'The Japanese Government has taken a firm line to
lesson the drain on foreign currency from “invisible”
trade items. It recently ordered a “fly Japanese and ship
Japanese” policy.
A new shipbuilding programme follows the path taken
by many nations these days. Domestic yards in Japan
are to build one million tons of freighters during the next
three years, thus reducing the demand for outside charters.
In fact, that total figure corresponds closely with the
foreign tonnage now being chartered by Japanese shipping
companies. Some 200,000 tons should be completed in
1965.
Another Government shipping instruction also soun (
thoroughly familiar. At present, foreign shippers bring
more than 92 p.c. of Japan’s wheat imports. Japane!
ships will soon be used to carry “at least 50 p.c.”.
So far as flying goes, Government workers must u s
Japanese Air Lines when travelling abroad. Up to not
nationals have made only 42 p.c. of JAL’s total passenge
compared with 72 p.c. of French nationals using A
France and 82 p.c. of Swedes using Scandinavian Airline
JAL does not yet come into Australia.
Quiet Monetary Games
As generally expected, the International Monetary Fun
meeting at Tokyo did not initiate any radical proposal
to lighten the problems of world liquidity. Apart froi
some French semi-political scepticism about the leadin
roles of the US dollar and sterling, members mostly felt i
a non-hurrying mood.
Even the details of the agreed increase in Fund quota;
were left to be worked out and will probably not tai
effect until next year. Although America wouli
apparently have liked a 50 p.c. build-up of the Fund
resources, 25 p.c. was settled on—with, however, a we:
come reinforcement from selective higher increases in
few scarce currencies, notably the West German mark at
Japanese yen.
Not unnaturally, Australia was joined by South Africai;
suggesting a rise in the price of gold. Again not ui
naturally, the US Secretary of the Treasury, Mr Dillot
defended the ruling price and merely warned that “mod
careful economy in the use of gold is required”. An
up-valuation of gold is equivalent to a devaluation of tli
dollar.
South Africa, of course, produces more than 20 millioi
fine ounces of gold a year. Its Finance Minister, N
Donges, argued for a “uniform change in par value
“Why not some basic consideration of ways to enham
the effectiveness of the largest and more stable componei
of international reserves, namely, gold?” he asked.
A “multilateral surveillance” of methods used to finant
balance-of-payments deficits (first suggested by the “Pat
Club” of eleven major industrial countries) was supports
by the Tokyo meeting. Most observers trust this surveil
lance will be undertaken by the Fund itself.
Keeping Up with Air Cargo
A ustralia will certainly not be left out of the ft ’
growing international air cargo market. The thr. ,
major overseas airlines which serve us, Pan Am, Qant: ,
and BOAC, are bringing in new cargo handling faciliti |
and bigger planes. i
Pan American has opened a £30,000 all-cargo tennis ;
at Sydney’s Kingsford Smith Airport. Permanent accot ;
modation is N provided for eight Pan Am cargo staff at
three Customs men to give service seven days a wee
The 5000 square feet building combines import and expo
sections with accommodation for loading and unloadif ■
four vehicles simultaneously. (
Qantas’ £i million cargo building at Mascot will t 5
working harder than ever next year when the first two.! j
six new larger capacity Boeings start on the westbouc c
Kangaroo route. At present it has 13 138Bs, which cart«
104 passengers and four to seven tons of cargo. The rf p
338 Cs can carry the same number of passengers but ha' r
increased capacity of up to 11 tons. v
BOAC will become a bigger force in Australia’s exp(; li

“CROESUS”
The Curse of Stanhill
Mr Murphy's case for liquidation
M r Peter Murphy QC’s unravelling
of the processes in which public
money subscribed to share and unse-
cured note issues of Stanhill Develop-
ment Finance Ltd. went through the
Korman sieve provides an illuminating
comment on the reckless mood of direc-
tors in the heady boom days of 1960.
The more interesting aspect now, though,
is the prospect the investigator opens up
for salvaging something from the wreck
by taking proceedings against one or
more of the directors for misfeasance.
If this is done, the report is confident
that very substantial sums might well be
recovered. Running through the mass of
detail of inter-company transactions one
finds the thread that, contrary to what
most people had believed, the bulk of
SDF’s funds did not go down the drain
of Chevron Sydney at all, but came to
rest in private companies and should be
winkled out.
Mr Murphy's account certainly makes
it plain that, although Stanhill Consoli-
dated, the key company of the Korman
group, ultimately became virtually the
only major creditor of SDF, the dis-
position of a lot of the funds passed on
by Stanhill Consolidated to companies
in its orbit was squarely in private com-
panies.
As to where it is now, and at what
valuations the assets of private compa-
nies were bought, Mr Murphy is not at
present prepared to say. We are to hear
more details in his next instalment—
‘'the method adopted to value the shares
(in Dominion Pty Ltd and Stanhill
Estates Pty Ltd) on their purchase by
Stanhill Consolidated is not, I think, a
matter to be gone into in detail in this
report but will form a considerable por-
tion of a later report upon the affairs of
these two family companies”. Perhaps
this further report will provide the
answer.
important thing up to now is that
Mr Murphy is confident that pro-
ceedings for misfeasance against direc-
tors of SDF will be fruitful of large sums
in damages. The inference is that the
directors are still in a position to pay
su ch sums. On the other hand, Mr
Murphy is insistent that such action is
only likely to be taken by a liquidator,
fi appears that neither the trustee com-
pany (f or the unsecured notes) nor the
receiver intend to apply to the court to
| v md up the company,” he says, so “if a
■quidator is the only person both able
a nd likely to take such proceedings this
is an important reason why the company
should be wound up.”
Flowever, unless there is a greater
hope of recovering more of the dissipa-
ted capital and loan money of SDF by
winding it up than by keeping the com-
pany in being (and obviously from what
Mr Murphy says, at least the trustee,
Mr STANLEY KORMAN
along with Mr Korman, is advocating the
latter course), there would have to be
more cogent reasons, one feels, for
winding it up. True, Mr Murphy is not
short of other reasons, even if in agreeing
with their force one also has to remem-
ber that the Companies (Public Borrow-
ings) Act 1963 now virtually precludes
directors taking the same irresponsible
courses with funds loaned to such com-
panies as SDF in the future.
Maybe Mr. Murphy is not allowing
sufficiently for the effect of this new legis-
lation in postulating “if a public com-
pany conducting itself in the way I have
detailed in this report is to be allowed
to continue in existence, would not the
general faith of the public in public com-
panies and in the law relating to them
tend to be lowered?” and further that
“it seems to me also that one should
consider the possible reaction of other
public companies if a company conduct-
ing itself as SDF did is to be allowed to
continue in existence.”
For while it is very proper that the
best legal course should be taken, either
by the receiver or the Crown, to catch
up with the horse which has bolted from
the SDF stable, it has to be recognised
that the Companies (Public Borrowings)
Act 1963 would seem in fact to have
locked the stable door against irrespon-
sible actions by directors in similar cir-
cumstances in the future.
This is not to say that an ingenious
company board, especially one com-
pletely dominated by a strong personal-
ity, will still not be able to juggle funds
between companies, either subsidiaries or
associate companies within its orbit,
especially where there is virtually com-
plete interlocking of directors. That
goes on all the time, even in the soundest
groups, where window-dressing of
finances at the end of financial years,
for instance, is a widely practised art for
which there remains considerable scope,
despite provisions to have all subsidiaries
balancing on identical dates with parent
companies. It simply means that, in
Victoria anyway, any important trans-
fers of funds to offshoots, be they other
public companies, subsidiaries or asso-
ciate companies, by public borrowing
corporations will have to be revealed in
the now compulsory interim reports to
trustees.
Tn the same way it would now be vir-
tually impossible for such a company
as SDF to get away with as blatant a
disregard of a prospectus as, on Mr
Murphy’s showing, SDF did in 1960, or
indeed to have disposed its funds with-
out obtaining the necessary documents
of security as the company seems to have
done all through. Needless to say, Mr
Murphy’s toothcomb has caught up in-
numerable actions by the directors of
SDF which could, even with the tighten-
ing of legislation, escape the notice of
the average trustee and it will be up to
the Crown Law Department to look for
loopholes in the legislation in the light
of these. It may be, for instance, that
the matters required to be reported on
quarterly to trustees will have to be
made rather more specific than at pre-
sent required by the new Act.
Broadly speaking, on the showing of
Mr Murphy's report, SDF directors
drove a coach and horses through the
old Companies Act and although in some
instances, such as the investigator's ver-
dict on the subscription of Stanhill Con-
solidated to the SDF issue in mid-1960,
terms such as “calculated to deceive”
occur in the text of the report, it may
yet be difficult for the Crown to prove
specific breaches of the old Act.
Obviously, none of the directors feels


very culpable, though of course Mr Kor-
man himself refused to give evidence in
the investigation. Lesser lights, albeit
at the centre of things on the board, like
Mr Redpath and Mr Carrodus, when
asked by the investigation about the
failure to get proper securities against
loans from SDF, said they were aware
that securities had not been obtained
“but bluntly stated that they were inter-
ested in the group as a whole and that
they simply trusted the borrower”. In a
manner of speaking, that seems to have
been the curse of SDF, especially as
looked at as a public company with its
outward obligations to shareholders and
noteholders —in fact as Mr Murphy
has had to look at it.
ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Fresh Pressures on Companies
Mr A. Shepherd not the only threat
npHE well-directed bowl of Mr A. Shep-
herd to scatter BHP’s kitty is
symptomatic of the current all-round
pressure on Australian companies. In
every direction management is plagued
with demands for higher rewards and
with bigger bills. Hardly had the big
BHP shareholder from Rose Bay finished
delivering his threat to form a sharehold-
ers’ committee to pressurise the board
for what works out at roughly a 36 p.c.
increase in the company’s distribu-
tion to shareholders, when the ACTU
proclaimed its intention to press for
another rise in the basic wage, tenta-
tively put at 12s. a week depending on
movements in the consumer price index
before the end of the year.
If management is shedding tears about
wages and dividends, it has also to
contend with the shortage of labor in a
market where, at the latest count, there
were 4000 more jobs available than
applicants to fill them; in special cate-
gories of skilled workers, pools of un-
employed are bone dry. Added to these
worries is the recent increase in com-
pany taxation. And in Victoria at any
rate, the State Treasurer is more firmly
on the backs of companies with a range
of higher stamp duties and charges
and, more notably, increases in railway
freights.
On top of all these, manufacturing
companies are beset with mounting costs
of raw materials, particularly for metals.
At the BHP meeting, Sir Colin Syme
said that BHP’s profit for 1963-64 would
have been £1 million lower if the tin
used by the company during the year
had cost the current inflated price. Even
so, he stated that the company’s produc-
tivity per man-hour had fallen last year.
Rising costs of materials, as well as labor
and the rest, would now be aggravating
the trend, which presumably could only
be reversed, on the short term at any
rate, by increasing prices for the com-
pany’s products.
TTiis doesn’t end the list of squeezes
on companies. At least one more, the
growing competition from imports,
should be mentioned. Although com-
panies with sheltered home markets are
not being affected by the increasing flood
of imports (in August, imports of £118.9
million were an all-time monthly record
and as much as £22.6 million higher than
in August last year), big increases in
finished consumer goods imports (which
were up from £17.3 million to £2O
million in July, the latest month for
which details are available) are disturb-
ing to the unsheltered companies.
this catalogue of pressures it
A would be logical to assume that com-
panies are encountering increasing tight-
ness in unit profit margins. However, it
is clear from the overall production per-
Mr A. SHEPHERD
formance of industry in recent months
that rising turnovers must be at least in
part compensating for any squeeze on
unit profit margins. Taking the figures
for August issued last week, one finds
that in only a handful of industries was
production lower than in the previo
August and most of these industries vve
relatively unimportant ones such as la?
mowers, chocolate-based confectionet
small electric motors and petrol intern
combustion engines. The only major i
dustry whose output was down %
woollen textiles, both yarn and wovt
cloth.
While it is understandable that cor
pany chairmen should be drawing shai
holders’ attention to the pressures t
companies, one must not jump to ea
conclusions that they will inevitably fe
to sharp increases in prices for facto
products in the near future. Such a co
elusion would be unwarranted from tl
general evidence.
Equally it is worth noting that of tl
25 companies so far (up to Septemk
17) to have reduced their dividends
results reported since June 30, very fc
have instanced rising costs as the ma
cause. In some cases their profits actuali

Others said they were reducing divider

spoke of more intensified competition
one of changes in the board’s distribute
policy, another of production problem
and so on.
True, at least some, if not all the
25 companies (out of a total of 1
reporting dividends since June 30) m
well be running more deeply into con
trouble now (for one r more of ti
reasons given earlier in this article),!
in total the 25 represent less than 5 p
of all companies reporting. Of the i
mainder, 196 (or about 38 p.c.) increas
their dividend rates for 1963-64 I
some cases on higher capital) wli
303 companies (58 p.c. of the to
reporting) maintained their divide
rates (for a good many of these on
creased capital).
A lthough some shareholders undoiit
edly think companies have been!
than generous in their distributions I
last year, this summation of divide
trends shows they haven’t done so ba!
even compared with wage earners, who*
average earnings appear to have incre
ed by about 7-8 p.c. during 19f
64. No estimate is available of the otf
all percentage increase in income fr
dividends last year. It would be surpt
ing, on a cursory inspection of divide!
announced up to the present, if it prov
to be less than the percentage rise

on this, one would have thought h
on economic and social grounds, t
shareholders’ pressure on comp?
boards to step up distributions i®

The Research Magnificent
Why drug prices appear so high
VTo one would dispute the importance
of the drug industry to the world.
Yet the industry, both here and overseas,
is possibly the most severely criticised
of any.
It is an industry which has to face
enormous research charges, many of
them never reimbursed. Disappoint-
ments by far outweigh delights. The
Bulletin has been told of one pharma-
ceutical company which recently spent a
fruitless £2.5 million in searching for an
anti-viral agent. The work produced
nothing which doctors could use.
Another group of companies spent £9
million on research and development
in order to put cortisone and hydrocorti-
sone on the market.
Worldwide, the drug industry is spend-
ing in excess of £AIBO million a year on
research. American laboratories alone
last year spent 280 million dollars, or
more than half of the world’s total, on
research. The bulk of the balance was
taken up by British and European work.
It is impossible to determine how much
of this research paid off, but it would be
fair to say only a small percentage. Even
after a new drug is developed, clinical
trials may prove the drug of little value
—or a lot of danger.
It has been estimated that about 2700
new chemical compounds are synthe-
sised, studied and rejected for every one
which is put on the market.
It is on this cost of research that the
industry faces its strongest criticism. A
director of one drug company in Austra-
lia said it was ridiculous to argue that
the industry overloaded its prices not
only to recoup research expenditure but
also to make an enormous profit. “The
margin of profit in this industry is very
small for those companies manufacturing
ethical drugs (those available only on a
doctor’s prescription).
“In our case it is about 12 p.c., but
the industry average is more like 9 p.c.
after tax. People don’t seem to realise
that to function properly we must be able
to get back money we have spent on
research for both triumphs and failures.
There is no set time for repayment of
this charge, either. It depends on the
demand for the drug and whether or not
it is admitted to the Government's phar-
maceutical benefits scheme. Since
nearly all research work is carried on
outside Australia, overseas sales are a
limiting factor as well.”
Drug companies resent the charge that
they are profiteering and point to the
fact that chemists must also take a pro-
fit. The following table (extracted from
the 1963-64 report of the Common-
wealth Director-General of Health)
shows the income of companies and
chemists from the benefits scheme:

1962- 24.6 16.3 40.9
1963- 24.7 16.6 41.3
The companies also point out that the
average cost of a prescription has been
showing a general downward trend. The
following table, extracted from the re-
port, details their point.

Of great importance to the Australian
pharmaceutical industry is the pharma-
ceutical benefits scheme. In the year
ended June 30, 1961, payments by the
Commonwealth for drugs on the
National Health Scheme totalled £24.4
million. In 1961-62 they came to
£31.4 million, 1962-63, £33.4 million,
and in the latest year, £33.5 million.
Air Commodore R. F. M. Green, exe-
cutive director of the Australian Asso-
ciation of Ethical Pharmaceutical Indus-
try, says that overall there has been a
general reduction in drug prices since
the war. “Sulpha products of four mem-
bers of the AAEPI between 1951 and
1961 averaged a cost reduction of 25.5
p.c., while average wholesale prices of
23 later sulphas made by nine companies
have fallen by 14.65 p.c. since 1958.
Streptomycin, developed in 1947, then
cost 30s. per gramme. When it was
first used in Australia in 1949 it cost
9s. per gramme. Now it is 2s. 6d.
“Sixteen capsules of an antibiotic able
to control pneumonia, but difficult to
obtain, cost £5 plus pharmacist’s charges
in 1950. Today the drug is available any-
where in Australia and supplied by the
National Health Service for ss. The
manufacturer’s cost to the Department of
Health is 50s. just half its 1950 price.
Air Commodore Green said the indus-
try “seems to come in for a lot of criti-
cism in Federal Parliament on the ques-
tion of drug prices. This is because the
pharmaceutical bill the Government pays
seems to be very high compared with
medical and hospital benefits it pays out.
Members pay little attention to the fact
that hospital benefits are paid by three
sources—the Government, the medical
insurance companies, and the patient.
Whereas the Government bears 75 to
80 p.c. of the cost of pharmaceutical
benefits, it pays only a small proportion
of hospital costs.”
Mr J. Doenau, Australian sales mana-
ger for Burroughs Wellcome and Co.
(Australia) Ltd, offshoot of the English
parent company, said all his company’s
research was carried out in England and
America. “In the UK drugs can be
sold at elevated prices for their first three
years on the market. Then they come
under price review. But you can’t set
a pattern for recouping your research
costs.
“For example, one of our main re-
search fields in New York is into anti-
leukemia drugs. One of them that has
come on to the market was researched
for ten years. An enormous expense
like this will take a long time to get back.


SOCIAL SCIENCE
RESEARCH COUNCIL
OF AUSTRALIA
A
ABORIGINES PROJECT
k
Research Fellow:
(£2OO0 —£2500.) Actual salary will be
fixed in relation to qualifications and ex-
perience.
Duties:
To organise and carry out surveys of the
economic situation of Aborigines and
groups of Aboriginal descent, more par-
ticularly in closely settled and urban areas
with particular reference to employment,
income and housing. After an initial
period of preparation, considerable travel
will be essential.
Qualifications:
A higher degree with honours in
economics, sociology, anthropology or
other appropriate social science field. Ex-
perience in Aboriginal affairs, or with
comparable social issues, will be an ad-
vantage.
The Project office has been established in
Sydney where it will be necessary for the
Research Fellow to be based. The focus of
the Project is upon the impact of policies
and administrative practices upon Aborigi-
nes and groups of Aboriginal descent. It is
hoped that the Research Fellow will make
a major contribution to the report and
recommendations; and will, in addition,
produce a monograph which may be pub-
lished subsequently.
Removal expenses will be paid up to £250.
Applications should be addressed to:
The Director,
Social Science Research Council's
Aborigines Project,
c/o School of Pu 1 Ire rfealth and
Tropical Medicine,
University of Sydney,
SYDNEY, N.S.W.
Closing date: 12th October, 1964.
Sales of this drug in Australia would
never reach £5OOO a year. We spend
about £2 million sterling a year on re-
search.”
Mr Doenau said competition in the
industry had increased since pharmaceuti-
cal benefits in Australia were extended in
1960. “The extension of these benefits
allowed the small manufacturer to come
in and make common name prepara-
tions (such as codeine compounds)
far more cheaply than we can. His
overheads are less and he has not had to
bear the cost of research. Even though
he can undercut the bigger houses he still
has a high profit margin.
A burgeoning list of trade names the
companies apply to their products means
the physician must keep one jump ahead
of himself if he is to know what prepara-
tions are available and what they do for
the patient. Some have been known to
complain that if they read every piece
of literature and interviewed every re-
presentative who calls at their surgeries
they would never have time to see any
patients.
Yet brand names, literature and
representatives are of vital importance to
manufacturers and they defend them-
selves against the charges that there are
too many. Mr. Doenau explained it this
way: “Although brand names certainly
have got a little out of hand (and I don’t
envy the GP at all) they are all import-
ant. They have become important in a
commercial sense. With the national
health, it is imperative that a doctor
knows the brand names under which
various drugs are sold.
“If the doctor prescribes a drug by its
chemical name the chemist is obliged, if
the drug is on the benefits list, to dis-
pense the cheapest product. On the
other hand, if the doctor specifies the
drug by its brand name the chemist must
dispense it, even though there may be
cheaper forms on the market. So you
can see how necessary it is that we name
our products and keep the doctor in-
formed. We haven’t mailed a piece of
literature on our products now for about
three years. We’ve seen the writing on
the wall and what happens to the litera-
ture that comes in so we now rely on
personal contact.
“As far as the industry’s future is con-
cerned, I don’t think there is any doubt
that the Government’s intention will be
fulfilled—to lower the price of drugs. I
think everyone in the industry is looking
for diversification, like consumer pro-
ducts, instead of those on prescription.
Ethical drugs are becoming less profitable
and this side of the business is more
restrictive.”
Dr Keith Gollan, general manager of
Pfizer Corporation, feels research could
suffer if the price of drugs is pushed
below economical levels. “Most of the
research today is done by private enter-
prise. It is a very costly business and, if
funds are not available, then there cannot
be any. The effect on research of con-
tinually lowering drug prices is worrying
everyone—the manufacturers, the medi-
cal profession and government people
who know the problem involved.
“We must keep the cost of drugs
down, but on the other hand there is no
easy and inexpensive way of carrying
out research. And there must be re-
search if there are to be breakthroughs
in medicine. In Italy, for instance, one
of the foremost chemical countries in the
world, there has not been one break-
through since 1938, when Mussolini
withdrew drug patents. This still ap-
plies today and, even though they have
the facilities for drug research, it is not
worth their while as they cannot patent
their products.
“Under the National Health Scheme
there are price reductions happening all
the time. With tetracyclines, for in-
stance, there have been numerous price
reductions in the past years. We have
been able to take these reductions be-
cause there is a constant need for our
products. However, in November last
year we reduced prices again and had to
cut back the distribution discount from
20 p.c. to 15 p.c.”
Falling drug prices have meant a large
amount of diversification. Companies
are doing this to ensure stability of re-
search. The parent Pfizer company in
America, for instance, owns Coty cos-
metics and is producing electronic metals
and basic polyurethane.
F|rug Houses of Australia Ltd,
manufacturing and wholesaling chem-
ist (which suffered a severe profit de-
cline in its latest year), has criticised
the National Health Scheme and manu-
facturers for its lower earnings. Chair-
man Mr J. H Mcßoberts said, “We have
experienced a most difficult and frus-
trating time in our merchandising divi-
sions. We were not alone in this respect,
for other full line pharmaceutical dis-
tributors suffered similarly.
“Gross earnings were again adversely
affected by the continuing substantial re-
ductions in official prices for ethical
items listed under National Health Act
regulations but, more importantly, our
gross income was severely reduced as a
result of the drastic 25 p.c. cut in the
distributing discount on broad spectrum
antibiotics.”
Mr Mcßoberts said individual and
trade efforts to counteract this influence
and many submissions to Commonwealth
Government officials had not met with
success. “We found ourselves and the
trade generally in a situation so strongly
affected by political considerations that
it was impossible to establish a satisfac-
tory basis for negotiation. It is a matter
of fact that the distributing discount
normally allowed by manufacturers of
ethical products was considered fair and
equitable when the pharmaceutical bene-
fits scheme was introduced and despite
close supervision it was not altered during
the war years, when stringent price con-
trols existed. We have absorbed heavy
increases in operating expenses since the
introduction of the national health
scheme and we consider that the distri-
buting discounts normally allowed by
manufacturers are necessary if we are to
carry out efficiently our business function,
which is predominantly wholesale dis-
tribution through 85 distributing units to
approximately 5000 pharmacies scattered
around this vast country.
“We consider it quite unreasonable
and unjustifiable to be compared with
wholesalers in other countries where con-
ditions on account of size and popula-
tion vary to such a marked degree.”

MARKET POINTERS
Basic Situation Unaltered
Economic factors and the share market,
The investment share market bounced
up again last week and several in-
vestors were heard to exclaim: “What
made it go down?’’
Perhaps it might have been more
pertinent to analyse why it bounced back
again. Those who were prepared to
sell at the higher prices before the
market fall were just as likely to buy
back in again at reduced prices.
The basic economic situation has not
altered. Nor has the Bs. 6d. in the £
company tax altered nor all the other
pressures on industry, such as higher
costs and labor shortages. In fact, the
labor shortage has grown more acute
and the Commonwealth Government is
more definite about the need for a de-
fence review, which obviously must entail
extra Government expenditure,
It would be a surprise, also, if imports
slackened off. Retailers and others will
be importing their Christmas stocks of
consumer goods and doubtless there will
be plenty of vehicle and automotive corn-
ponent imports to beat any possible tariff
rise . after the current tariff inquiry on
vehicles,

]Vf R Nicholas Aboud, the new mana-
ging director of Buckinghams Ltd,
told us that he personally had gone
through the book debts and had re-
quested that a further £362,450 be writ-
ten off as bad debts, making the total
write-off for the year £461,000.
We quizzed him if he thought this
was the end of the write-offs and cited as
examples the recent problems of certain
finance groups. No one knows if an
existing debt will go bad, but the com-
pany has instituted an arrears procedure
whereby bad debts will be written off
every month before arriving at monthly
trading profits.
With a tightening-up in debt control
and a more selective policy in credit sel-
ling (with more emphasis on short-term
selling), Mr Aboud feels the company is
in a much sounder position.
If he is right, and the trading profits
continue to rise, the 6s. Id. net assets
backing for the ss. shares provides some
buffer for those investors who buy the
shares at around the 2s. mark.
New stores at Liverpool and Warra-
wong (a shopping centre in the Port
Kembla area) should assist profits in the
current year, while the installation of a
much tighter credit system must create
greater efficiency.
Credit retailers have had their pro-
blems recently and investors are a bit
wary. But it seems that at depressed
levels of around 2s. 65., Buckingham’s
shares could be a reasonable speculation
for a recovery.
★ ★ ★
Gravel’s 42.3 p.c. earning rate
and one-for-four bonus were hardly
surprising. The company, because of
its tight capital and its happy position in
the quarrying business, has been recom-
mended here as a certainty in the past.
★ ★ ★
HPalking about quarries, the Melbourne
group has come up to expectations
with sharp profit increases by Albion and
Bay view. Reid’s Quarries was less spec-
tacular, but the market is still expecting
a buoyant result from Consolidated
Quarries which, at 14 5., yields 4.5 p.c.
against a recent 4.2 p.c. from Albion
and 3.5 p.c. from Bayview.
Going on earnings yield, Bayview still
looks attractive with a rate of 7.7 p.c.,
particularly after Boral’s takeover offer
for Albion and Reid’s.
★ ★ ★
HThe reduced profit of James Stedman
Ltd on increased turnover should
be taken seriously as a pointer to results
of strongly entrenched companies. In-
creased costs were the reason and the
reduction in earnings could only be
avoided by raising prices.
Earning rate of 25.9 p.c. is still hand-
some, yet the warning is still implicit.
Even the solid, successful companies can
have cost problems. The easy solution
of raising prices is not always possible in
an intensely competitive market.

Within a Master-Keyed System, if required,
certain locks may be grouped in a section
Keyed-Alike to a given Service-Key, and still
subject to the Master-Key.
GRAND MASTER-KEYED SYSTEM
Each lock has its own individual key which
operates that lock only and no other, but the
locks are divided into two or more groups.
Each group is subject to its own Master-Keyj
which opens all locks in that group, but no
other group.
However, all locks are also subject to a
Grand Master-Key which opens all locks in
all groups.
As with Master-Keyed Systems, Keyed-Alike
groups may also be included in G.M.K. Systems.

INVESTMENT SECTION
New Era for the Quarriers
Boral starts the pot boiling
Tf the complex Boral organisation is
successful in its takeover bid for
Melbourne’s two remaining independent
quarrymasters—Albion and Reid’s—a
new era will be spelt out for the industry,
in Victoria at least. Competition, which
has hampered or even crippled the vari-
ous quarriers from time to time, could
either come to the fore again or be
pushed right into the background.
The gigantic Bayview-Bladin group
will find itself facing an ogre-like com-
petitor. The smaller companies, like
Rowlands, may have to look for partners
of their own to side with if any fighting
develops. Even better, they may decide
to “join ’em” if they can't “lick ’em”
and seek a takeover bid from one of the
big groups.
Thanks to the lessons which were
learnt between 1960 and 1963, during
W'hich time the drastic measure of price-
cutting was resorted to in an effort to
get what little business there was, the
possibilities of a battle are rather re-
mote. Boral will have paid no small
sum for its interests and would un-
doubtedly be displeased to see falling
profits. Bayview-Bladin, on the other
hand, would prefer to avoid any grap-
pling with the formidable Boral organi-
sation because it is too small in compari-
son to have a chance of winning.
So it seems that the ultimate outcome
must be agreement. This will now be
made much easier if two competitors
are lumped into one.
The forward-looking investor will not
fail to watch closely the remaining firms
in the industry. If agreement on certain
matters exists between the big firms, then
one of the best ways for them to gain
ground without violating any agreements
would be in takeover of the smaller
companies.
Big Brother Bay view
we all have seen, the quarrying in-
dustry has recovered much of the
ground it lost between 1960 and 1963,
after extensive internal troubles The
1963-64 results from Albion, Reid’s and
Rowlands all illustrated this. But last
week's announcement from Bayview must
surely top the lot as far as recovery is
concerned.
Profit jumped from £165,000 to
£348,000. Earning rate is up from 13
p.c. to 24.7 p.c. and dividend from 9
p.c. to 11 £ p.c. The profit by far sur-
passes the previous record of £238,000
made in 1960-61, which equalled 27.2
p.c. on capital. Dividend is not back
to the peak 12i p.c. level of that year as
yet, though it seems that the rate has
every chance of being reinstated in the
current 1964-65 year.
To start with, the 1963-64 final pay-
out of 6i p.c. lends weight to this
thought. Then again, directors said last
week that sales in the two months of this
financial year were continuing at “favor-
able” levels. On a more general plane,
it must be remembered that, although
competition in the industry is still
strong, Bayview's position as by far
the biggest quarrymaster in Melbourne
will stand it in good stead.
The early 1963-64 merger with Bladin,
then the third largest operator, put the
group well in front of any competitor as
regards size. This current year will be
the first full term in which the group
will operate as a whole. The 1963-64
earning would more than double a 121
p.c. payout in 1964-65. Even if the
315,000 deferred shares issued to Bladin
as part of the takeover deal ranked,
the cover would still be adequate.
Undoubtedly, the extensive success of
the merger has almost as much to do
with the startling result as the general
recovery in the industry. Its strong po-
sition must be enhanced, too, by the fact
the group now has five ready-mixed con-
crete plants, a hot and cold mix asphalt
plant and a bitumen spray to help off-
set any detrimental fluctuations in the
basic quarrying and stone-crushing activi-
ties.
Again, unlike other quarries, an ex-
tremely heavy depreciation policy pur-
sued by directors since 1960-61 gives a
certain extra degree of stability to the
future. In 1962 and 1963, the deprecia-
tion rate was more than the net profit.
In the latest year it was £335,000
slightly less than net profit. If such a
heavy charge turns out to be unwarrant-
ed, shareholders must ultimately benefit
from any accumulation of unnecessary
provisions.
Electrolytic Vigor
Investors appeared quite content to
keep EZ Industries’ 10s. shares close
to the prevailing 245., even after the dis-
closure of a handsome and record pro-
fit for the 1963-64 year. For good
measure, and what might have pressed
the market a bit higher, dividend was
advanced from 10 to 13 p.c. its best
level in eight years and the holding
company’s top payout since 1960’s 11
p.c.
In a less cautious metals (and general)
atmosphere, share prices had moved up
to 265. 3d. earlier this year. That kind
of level doesn’t look right around the
corner just yet.
Of course, EZ's latest earning buoy-
ancy could have surprised very few.
Directors seem also to have moderated
an excellent overall result by a rather
conservative approach to revealed pro-
fit.
The consolidated figure, at about
£2,897,0,00, represents a jump of some
£554,000. Tax provision, though, goes
up by 60 p.c. to £2,209,900 and a new
provision for annual leave takes
£145.000. The usual provision for long-
service leave is increased bv as much as
£82,000 to £93,000.
Directors ascribe the better profit
mainly to the group’s Tasmanian mining
operations. Certainly the much improved
world zinc prices confer their greatest
benefits on the producers of concentrate.
But EZ must have done well from its
refining activities for the Barrier com-
panies too.
Favorable cadmium prices, together
with a vigorous demand for super-
phosphate and sulphuric acid, would also
make their contributions to profit.
Queries for M. B. John
\ lthough the annual report from
M. B. John and Hattersley predicted
“satisfactory” overall results for 1964-65
(1963-64 profit peaked at £282,000 and
dividend was 10 p.c. steady), certain
other comments in the document left
shareholders rather uneasy. The “satis-
factory” prediction was based on the
fact that all subsidiaries had ample work
on hand at balance date, with inquiries
continuing to flow.
With large Government and private
projects planned for completion in the
next two years or so, “innumerable
valves” will be required, according to
directors. This was all very well, but,
when the report turned to examine the
subsidiary companies, after making a
fleeting reference to competition in some
of the parent’s products, the picture be-
came rather clouded.
In 1963-64, the report said, Gordon
Marr and Sons saw a slightly lower profit
after a 5 p.c. sales drop. B. C. Richards
and Co. lifted sales 33 p.c. but profit
fell because of technical and marketing
problems. James Kemp and Co. lifted
sales 160 p.c. but extreme competition

adversely affected profits. Steel Co. of
Australia increased sales 24.6 p.c. and
profit was “satisfactory”, even though it
was affected by “industrial disturbances”.
In the James Kemp subsidiary, the
situation is apparently rather bad, since
a thorough investigation into marketing
policy and price structure has been
ordered.
Shareholders can do little but place
their faith in the directors’ comments.
Surely a fuller explanation could have
been given to close the discrepancy be-
tween the poor performance of these
subsidiaries and the board’s comments
on the current year. Maybe the annual
meeting will throw some light on the
situation.
Venetians Up
Venetian blind-maker Hunter Douglas
Ltd (two of its brand names are
MeHo-Lite and Luxaflex) staged a strong
profit recovery in the year to June 30
after substantially higher tax.
Profit rose £41,100 or 25.6 p.c. to
£201,635 but it failed to compensate the
previous year’s £60,770 drop. Tax was
£131,858 (up £19,721) and depreciation
£90,083 (up £305).
Directors say an improvement in
operating efficiency, new products and
product developments as well as aggres-
sive marketing and merchandising pro-
grammes contributed towards the im-
proved result. Increased sales in the
first half of the year continued in the
second half.
An even better result is likely at
next balance date as the company's
primary activities are connected with
building. The 20s. shares (at the annual
meeting on October 26 directors will
recommend they be split into 10s. units)
at 40s. yield 5 p.c. on the steady 10
p.c. dividend.
Salting Profits to Reserves
this year, February 22 to be
exact, The Bulletin hinted that the
big National Consolidated group was in
for a record 1963-64 and that share-
holders may be in for capital benefits.
As shareholders already know, the latter
prediction came about earlier than ex-
pected in mid-April a one-for-five
bonus issue was announced. Last week, a
record 1963-64 result was reported to the
stock exchanges.
Profit climbed from last year’s peak of
£1,033,000 to £1,180,000. The figure
would have hit £1,227,000 if company
tax had not been lifted, according to the
directors. Despite the new rate, tax does
seem to have taken a rather sharp jump
—from £691,000 to £868,000 suggest-
ing that directors are salting a bit more
away to reserves than the £250,000 figure
mentioned in their report.
One often wonders just how long the
group can go on chalking up one success
after another. The year’s dividend will
be held at 20 p.c., even though the new
shares issued only last May rank for the
final p.c. The 1963-64 record is
the twelfth in succession despite econo-
mic fluctuation, the credit squeeze, etc.
The result is three times that achieved in
1959. [t represents 36.4 p.c. on capital
(43.7 p.c on pre-bonus capital), com-
pared with 43.7 p.c. last year.

WHALE INDUSTRIES
LIMITED
14TH ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
Address to Stockholders
THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING of the Company was held at the
Todd Assembly Hall, 135 Macquarie Street, Sydney, on Tuesday, 15th Septem-
ber, 1964, at 12 o’clock noon. After opening the meeting and dealing with formal
matters, the Chairman, Mr. R. Crichton-Brown, gave the following address to
Stockholders.
LADIES and GENTLEMEN,
The Balance Sheet and Accounts, together with the Directors’ Report covering
the operations of the Whale Industries Limited Group for the nine months ended
30th June, 1964, have been in your hands for some days and with your permission
I propose to take them as read.
The problems associated with the termination of whaling, the disposal of
whaling assets and the re-organisation of the Group, which were dealt with in the
Directors’ Report last year, have now been largely completed. It is with pleasure
that your Directors can report that our expectations during this period as a pastoral
company have been largely fulfilled.
The Consolidated Accounts covering the operations of the
Group for the nine months ended 30th June, 1964, show a
surplus of __ —.— £102,491
from which deduct:—
Depreciation 30,564
Provision for Income Tax 62 30,626
Leaving a profit for the period of 71,865
to which add:—
Balance brought forward from preceding year 14,701
Profits on sales of Fixed Assets 3,764
Losses of Subsidiary Companies sold now written back 64,616
Sales of Whaling Assets previously written off 7,617
Leaving available £162,563
From which the board recommends a dividend of 5% to be
declared and made payable at the close of the Meeting 37,450
Leaving a balance to be carried forward of £125,113
Losses associated with the winding up of whaling activities have reduced the
Group’s liability for income tax and indeed substantial tax losses are carried forward
into the current year.
Movements in Reserves are dealt with fully in the Notes attaching to and
forming part of the Accounts. These movements were the result of the disposal of
subsidiary companies during the period under review.
GURLEY STATION
.
(a) Farming It is now approaching 5
years since we purchased this property
and during that time we have carried
out extensive improvements.
, • , „
Dunng the period under review, a
further 4,000 acres has been cleared and
broken up for crops and after allowing
for some of the older country to rotate
we shall have approximately 20,000
acres under crops for the 1964/65 har-
vest. Of this some 14,700 acres has been
sown to wheat and the balance has been
or will be sown to linseed, oats and sor-
ghum.
Results of last year s harvest were en-
couragmg, particularly having regard to
firstly the proportion of new country to
old country sown to crops, secondly to
losses due to rain and thirdly to the
inability of the Grain Elevators Board
receive more than 20% of our
j lir]r .„ 1
&
In all, we produced some 290,000
bushels of wheat, some 1,500 tons of sor-
ghum and 70 tons of linseed.
Wheat sown this year is well advanced
and if satisfactory seasonal conditions
continue we expect to harvest in excess
of 400,000 bushels.
We are at present carrying out exten-
sive tests on the application of super-
phosphates on our cereal crops. We are
also testing new strains of wheat and to
date these tests have produced most
encouraging results.
This enormous farming operation,
which is probably the largest of its type
in Australia, is being carried out with
very heavy equipment of the most mod-
em type, all of which is owned and
operated by the Company.
One of the major problems facing
wheat farmers throughout N.S.W. and
particularly in the North-West, is the
inadequacy of the receival and storage
facilities of the Grain Elevators Board
of N.S.W. It is recognised that the
N.S.W. Government Railways could not
be expected to move the whole of the
season’s harvest during harvest time and
we, therefore, believe that it is the res-
ponsibility of the Grain Elevators Board
to provide sufficient receival and storage
facilities in the wheat growing areas to
accept the whole of the wheat crop dur-
ing the harvest period.
It is noteworthy that the Grain Elev-
ators Board could accept only a very
small proportion of our wheat during
harvesting in November and December,
1963, and it was not until May, 1964,
five months after we completed harvest-
ing, that the Grain Elevators Board was
in a position to take our final deliveries.
This inadequacy cost us and other
growers in the district not only interest
charges through delay for many months
in receiving wheat proceeds but also
losses through spoilage of grain, the ex-
tra expense of double handling of a large
proportion of the harvest, and in our
case the provision of costly bulk storage
facilities of our own. These additional
costs of production are serious to both
large and small growers and we feel
should not be tolerated: the more so as
the cost to growers of maintaining the
Grain Elevators Board of N.S.W. and
the Australian Wheat Board amounts to
some 5% of total wheat sales (in addi-
tion freight charges to the seaboard, are
also borne by growers).
The failure of the Grain Elevators
Board to provide adequate facilities for
the prompt receival of wheat as harvest-
ed with consequent delay in payment
of the first advance by the Australian
Wheat Board and increased production
costs could easily be overcome if the
Grain Elevators Board would agree to
give growers pro-forma receipts for
wheat delivered by growers to approved
‘on the farm’ storage.
However, our repeated representations
in this regard have been unsuccessful.
If the Grain Elevators Board and the
Australian Wheat Board maintain their


tion was its first for a full twelve months
The release made by directors leave; >
a few questions unanswered.
Profit was £383,000, equalling 8 p.c
on ordinary capital. Dividend will b(
6 p.c. Such an earning rate is unsatis-;
factory, to say the least. Directors point-
ed out that improvement in efficiency
were reflected to some extent, but the-
main benefits have yet to accrue.
This is all very well. There is another:
side to the Simpson Pope penny—tax
This took only £5,000 in 1963-64 be-
cause of the recouping of losses. Appar-
ently there are further benefits yet tc
come from this source. Directors shoulc
indicate whether benefits from efficiency
improvements will have accrued to ar
extent which will enable earning rates':
to be maintained, once the company
becomes fully liable for tax.
Again, it is unlikely that the full effects
of reorganisation will dovetail with thd !
full tax liability. Such being the case.;
directors should indicate whether one
will eventually outweigh the other
Failing this, shareholders must be ver>;
wary benefits from efficiency wouldji
have to indeed be enormous to counter-
act normal tax. If the counter-effect is
not sufficient, the already low earning
rate would become meagre and dividends
would undoubtedly be cut.
LNC Streaks Ahead
Ohareholders of NSW Volkswagen
distributor LNC Industries Ltd have
had as good a year as the company.
First of all they received a 2s. 6d. capital
return on their ss. shares and now the>
are being paid a 22i p.c. dividend outj
of profit which improved by 68.3 p.c.
Consolidated net profit jumped
£135,517 to £333,923 to make an earn-
ing rate of 43.8 p.c. on smaller capital.
The return reduced it from £1,186,309j
to £753,782. The latest result remained
after much higher tax even though direc-
tors said part of the profit improvement j
was due to a tax saving of about £54,000
on previous losses. Tax was up £35,937
to £165,200 and depreciation up £2,228:
to £37,729.
Directors say VW sales climbed from;
8564 to 11,087. The group also holds
Rambler and Rover franchises.
The market was very impressed with
LNC's result and added Is. 3d. to the 1
shares to make them 14s. 4d. where
they yield 7.8 p.c.
Stramit Comes Good
RFhe Bulletin's prediction of a bigger
-*■ dividend from Melbourne's Stramit
Boards (June 20 issue, p. 62) was proved;
correct last week. After a profit lift'
present stand as to these representations
the problems can only be overcome if
the Grain Elevators Board increases its
facilities with expedition.
Food perhaps is the greatest weapon
for peace and for our prosperity. Surely
greater incentives and greater encour-
agement should be given to farmers to
grow more cereals and in so doing to
reduce production costs. It seems ironical
that secondary industry should receive
special taxation allowances for export
income and that such allowances are in
practice not available to primary indus-
try which for so long has earned so much
of our export income.
(b) Grazing Although we now have
some 20,000 acres under farming, I am
happy to report that we have been able
to maintain our sheep numbers, due,
largely, to good seasonal conditions and
improved pastures.
Slightly under 20,000 sheep and lambs
were shorn in August and our wool clip
is approximately the same as last year.
We are particularly concerned at the
proposal to establish a Floor Price Plan
for wool and, in common with many
growers, we are opposed to it.
We believe that such a plan will con-
siderably increase growers’ costs at a
time when every effort should be made
to reduce costs. Reduced production
costs are surely the first line of attack
in the battle with synthetics.
The minimum price that buyers on
the auction or any other selling system
are prepared to pay for wool is the price
at which wool competes with man-made
fibres.
We believe that we shall not get more
for our wool by fixing a minimum price,
which is not in relation to the compar-
able price for man-made fibres. Rather
do we believe that such a system will
drive buyers away from wool, thus re-
sulting in a substantial unsold surplus
with attendant financing costs and sub-
sequent dumping on the market. The
minimum reserve price foreshadowed
would certainly have no effect on in-
creasing or stabilising prices.
There is not an over-production of
wool. The problem as we see it is to
maintain our cost structure at a level
where wool is competitive with man-
made fibres and, at the same time, pro-
fitable to growers.
Surely the emphasis should not be on
changing the system of selling wool but
on improving promotion, improving pro-
duction methods, improving quality and
reducing production costs.
To suggest that the fixing of an arti-
ficial price is the answer to our problems
begs the question. It is misleading and
m our view would be quite ineffective.
The proposed plan envisages Govern-
ment subsidy with the attendant impact
on the taxpayer. Long term this can only
result in Government control of the in-
dustry.
Finally on this point, as the cost to
wheat growers of the Wheat Board and
Grain Elevators Board of N.S.W.
amounts to approximately 5% of total
wheat sales, is it unreasonable to assume
that the costs associated with a Floor
Price Plan will be anything less percen-
tagewise to the woolgrower? At 70d.
per lb., this would represent approxim-
ately £4.7.6 per bale of 300 lbs., in addi-
tion to the promotion levy of £1.12.10
per bale, a total cost of £6.0.4 per bale.
FINLEY PROPERTIES As forecast last
year, it is our intention to dispose of
these properties during the current year.
Although the properties are operating
profitably, your Directors believe that
the funds can be better employed nearer
our principal operating centre. This will
also result in reduced management costs.
SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES Three
Subsidiary Companies Farm Marga-
rine Pty. Limited, Hi-Protein Pty. Lim-
ited and Feed Lots Pty. Limited were
sold during the period. The Whale In-
dustries Limited Group now consists of
only two Subsidiary Companies, namely,
Gurley Station Pty. Limited, which owns
all the Group’s freehold and leasehold
land and improvements, and Gurley Pty.
Limited, which is the Group’s operating
subsidiary.
GENERAL Whaling assets which had
previously been written off were sold
during the period for the sum of £7,617.
Notwithstanding losses of some
£415,000 associated with the winding up
of the Company’s whaling activities and
written off in past years Stockholders’
Funds at the 30th June. 1964, totalled
some £908,000, which included £159,000
in Reserves and Unappropriated Profits.
The period under review includes, in
general terms, the proceeds from one
wool clip and one year’s harvest. The
year ending on 30th June, 1965, will
include one year’s wool clip, one year’s
harvest and sale of one year’s surplus
sheep and cattle.
With favourable seasonal conditions,
your Directors expect the results for the
current year to be satisfactory.
CONCLUSION I should like to thank
all members of our staff and particularly
our Pastoral Inspector, Mr. W. Grant
Davies, and our Property Manager, Mr.
A. R. Lester, whose efforts have contri-
buted so largely to the restoration of
your Company.
I should also like to thank my col-
leagues on the Board who have given
so much of their time and thought to
the Company.

from £107,000 to a new peak of
A 14,000 in the year to lune 30, share-
lolders are to collect a 123 p.c. dividend,
compared with 10 p.c. last year and
lothing in 1962.
One feature of the directors’ an-
nouncement which requires explanation
s the depreciation provision. Despite the
company’s expansion during the year,
this has been cut back from £41,000 to
£30,000.
The new dividend remains better than
twice - covered. High earnings of 27.6
p.c. and the new business which must
undoubtedly come to the company in
1964-65 as its products attain a wider
usage both give weight to new share
issue thoughts.
Bright Wells
!Tshe comprehensive preliminary report
from Martin Wells Holdings Ltd is
one that many other companies could
well afford to emulate. It enhances the
excellent result if contains.
For its first year as a public company,
Martin Wells’ consolidated net profit at
£65,820 compared with the previous
year’s £53,898 as disclosed in the pros-
pectus. Last year’s figure was arrived at
after calculating tax at public company
rates.
Tax for the year to June 30 was
£63,596 (up £27,496) and depreciation
£26,194 (up £9341). Jn addition, non-
recurring formation and placement ex-
penses of £Bl7O were written off. Divi-
dend is at the forecast rate of 10 p.c.
and, with the £2OOO preference payment,
absorbs £27,000. Earning rate was 25.5
p.c., as against the previous year’s 20.7
p.c.
As an ophthalmic spectacle frame
maker, the main subsidiary Martin Wells
Pty Ltd increased sales during the year
by 34 p.c. and raised exports 57 p.c. It
now exports to 28 countries and already
has South Africa in its sights as the 29th.
Joint managing director Mr Eric Hurst
will leave Australia in November to study
the South African market.
Not only is the company exporting
frames but also know-how. Directors
say they are examining applications by
several US companies to manufacture
under licence the Martin Wells’ repair-
able concealed joint, which is already
being produced under licence in Britain.
The ss. shares on which a 2s. 6d. pre-
mium was placed for flotation are avail-
able for about 235. 6d.
Scotts improves
Qcotts Provisions Holdings Ltd
improved its profit for the fourth
successive time with a lift from £69,909
to £72,710 in the year to June 30.
Earning rate moves up from 17.5 to 18.2
p.c. after tax of £50,413 (last year
£40,478) and depreciation £32,457
(£31,542).
The ss. shares are currently yielding
4.7 p.c. from the price of 10s. 9d. on
the steady 10 p.c. dividend.
A Recovery Long Overdue
shareholders have been wait-
ing a long time for the recovery
which the company has finally managed
to chalk up. The 1963-64 profit jumped
42 p.c. to £35,000 and dividend will be
continued at 10 p.c.
The result is the best since 1961, the
year after which setbacks came onto
the scene. It also represents the first
decent gain in earnings since listing in
1959-60. They declined from 34.4 p.c.
to 10.3 p.c. by 1961-62. Last year they
rose slightly to 12.7 p.c. and now they
are a healthy 17.4 p.c.

The 1964-65 prospects for this manu-
facturer and distributor of earth-moving
and materials handling equipment look
fairly good. So too, do the shareholders’
chances of a'return to the 12i p.c. divi-
dend rate of 1961. Latest earnings would
cover it well, anyway. The 1964-65 re-
sult has a head start in the first place
because the 1963-64 performance was
achieved despite an industrial gas strike
in Victoria which lasted rpore than two
months.
A Good Interim
A mid the seasonal welter of annual
results, a mere interim report may
sometimes be overlooked. Investors,
however, should not fail to consider the
six months’ statement, to June 30, from
F. W. Williams Holdings.
Directors draw attention to a higher
level of trading and announce a 5 p.c.
interim dividend, to hold the 10 p.c.
rate paid since 1960.
The rather diverse group is doubtless
gaining a fair amount of impetus from
current prosperity in the building indus-
try. Its 50 p.c. owned St Regis-Williams
Pty Ltd makes waterproofing papers and
polythene materials, used for insulation
by builders, apart from their more widely
known demand in packaging and agri-
culture.
Farm supply and plastic subsidiaries
should also be trading favorably.
F. W. Williams’ 1963 profit showed a
strong uptrend in earning rate. The
forward drive can hardly be exhausted
yet.
Share prices stick fairly close to
335., where the dividend yield is 3 p.c.
on earnings yield at 5 p.c.
Grouped Success
rouped Holdings, the Melbourne-
based investor in the short-term
money market and merchant banking as-
sociate of A. C. Goode and Co., share-
brokers, looks rather near an issue of
shares. The 1963-64 result, released
last week, shows the rapid expansion
which the company and its subsidiaries
have gone through. There is little reason
why this should not continue.
In fact, the £250,000 raised by a pre-
ference issue last March indicates that
directors are expecting further expansion
m 1964-65. Last week’s profits and di-
vidend announcement indicates that a
fiormal shareholders’ issue may now be
imminent as well. Despite a colossal
Profit lift from £26,000 to £95,000 and
the swell in earning rate from 14.9 p.c.
to 22.2 p.c., dividends will remain at
8 p.c.
The most obvious explanation for this
is that, with more expansion ahead,
directors are contemplating an issue and
to lift dividend at this stage would only
create an awkward precedent.
There are two other possibilities. One
is stinginess, which can be ruled out,
considering past history. The other is
that the profit may have created a posi-
tion where, if dividend was held, the sur-
plus, combined with the March prefer-
ence raising, leaves enough money to
finance 1964-65 expansion. This possi-
bility is less likely than the new issue
one. Even if it is the case, shareholders
will ultimately benefit from even bigger
earning rates, dividend lifts, and the ul-
timate bonus issue from profit reserves.
Gains from Flex drive?
A n extremely high earning rate and
expansion plans on hand make
Flexdrive Industries a likely contender

for a share issue within the next two or
three months. In announcing a record
1963-64 profit, equal to 44.6 p.c. on
capital, last week, directors said a con-
servation of funds was necessary to
finance 1964-65 expansion.
They were explaining why they had
decided to reduce the total dividend pay-
out from 17+ p.c. to 15 p.c. The basic
rate has actually been lifted from 121
p.c. to 15 p.c., for last year’s payout
included a 5 p.c. bonus. The company is
based in Melbourne as a manufacturer
and distributor of automotive parts and
machine tools.
With such a high earning rate, a size-
able share issue could be made without
endangering the 15 p.c. dividend rate.
An issue seems logical, otherwise share-
holders will be getting a negative benefit
from the company's success that is,
the 21 p.c. dividend cut.
With the ss. shares currently fetching
31s. and yielding a meagre 2.4 p.c.,
the market is obviously expecting capital
gains too.
Nile Flows Slowly
VTile Textiles’ shares have finally
surfaced above par value but are
still in a very shaky position. Investors
are only just giving them the benefit of
the doubt (a fate suffered by many other
companies in the rag trade) and are sell-
ing them at about ss. Id. at the time of
writing. In terms of profit recovery,
though, the latest result is heartening.
From a loss of £19,000 in 1962 to a
profit of £13,717 in 1963 it has turned
in an even better result of £45,586.
Still only an earning rate of 9.2 p.c.,
but it gives satisfactory cover to the
doubled 6 p.c. dividend. In November
last year directors said some relief had
been obtained from tariffs granted on
handkerchiefs, towels and pillow cases,
but imports still forced the company to
trade on narrow margins. The future
of the company will be decided on
whether or not this relief will continue.
Woolcord 9 s Worrying Ways
llToolcord Fabrics, manufacturer of
" furniture coverings, continues to
surprise shareholders and investors with
its annual results. Rather violent fluctua-
tions have always been a characteristic
of the firm’s performance, so most of
the shareholders take the matter in their
stride.
The financial record since 1960 pro-
vides as good an example of these
fluctuations as any other period. Earning
rate in that year was a healthy 14.8
p.c., from which 8 p.c. was distributed
as dividends. In 1961, earnings were
nearly halved to 7.9 p.c. and the dividend
was cut to 7 p.c. It was restored to
8 p.c. in 1962, when earnings recovered
well to 12.1 p.c.
The 1963 year was the most startling
in this period earnings halved again,
this time to 6 p.c., and the dividend
cut to 5 p.c. The 1964 result, released
last week, reveals an earnings recovery
to 8.7 p.c., while the dividend is back
to 8 p.c. One needs a strong constitution
to be a shareholder in Woolcord.
Engineer Wavers
and machinery maker H. P.
Gregory and Co. will need to
furnish a fuller explanation to share-
holders than the “extremely difficult
trading conditions” which apparently cut
the 1963-64 profit back to £34,332,
after the previous year’s £92,833.
Directors’ preliminary statement also
brought news of a dividend reduction to
7i p.c. The traditional 10 p.c. rate had
even received a 5 p.c. bonus fillip in
1960.
Since 1959 especially, both sales and
profits had exhibited an assured trend.
Indeed, on considerable capital increases,
earning rates always kept above 22 p.c.
during the last three years. The com-
pany’s broadened range seemed to
guarantee a consistent future.
On the latest result, the markets did
not hesitate to bring the ss. shares
down Is. to 9s. They stood as high as
14s. 3d. earlier in the year and at 14s.
6d. in 1963.
Fire Fighting Returns
Fighting Equipment has arrested
its downward earning trend and re-
versed last year’s £38,871 loss with a
profit of £63,775.
Despite falling profits over the last
four years, it had always kept faith with
shareholders maintaining 10 p.c. until
last year. Now it returns to the dividend
list with 6 p.c., to be paid out of earnings
of 9.3 p.c.
Tax (£18,335) and depreciation
(£47,860) are almost steady in the latest
result. Shares are currently yielding
5 p.c. on their 6s. price.
Correction
Australian United Corporation’s
earned profit for the year to June 30
was £506,743 and not £407,000 as re-
ported in The Bulletin of September
26. Directors eliminated AUC’s invest-
ment in Australian Factors Ltd by writ-
ing it out from group unappropriated
profits in the amount of £199,550, not
from the 1963-64 result.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Record of a True Retailer
John Meagher has merits in its own right
Although John Meagher (Holdings)
Ltd was formed only ten years ago,
the original business of “general store-
keepers” was founded ninety-seven years
ago. The centenary, therefore, will come
up in another three years. Interest in
this stock seems to have been generated
mainly over the last two years and
seems to be due, in some measure, to
the prospects of a takeover bid by
Myer Emporium, which acquired Farm-
ers, which had acquired Western Stores.
The attraction of the Meagher stores is
that they “dominate” each of the towns
in which trading operations are conduct-
ed, thereby tending to discourage poten-
tial competitors from attempting to
establish new trading outlets in these
towns. It seems to me that the stock
probably has some merit in its own
right, for at current prices around, say,
14s. 6d. the immediate dividend yield is
4.3 p.c. According to the preliminary
announcement the 12i p.c. dividend is
covered 1 } times even on the total capi-
tal now in issue.
The company has an excellent record
of increasing profits since 1958. Prior
to that date it had tended to be a little
erratic and the dividend rate was reduc-
ed to 8 p.c. in 1955/56. However, the
company has more than made up for
this reduction, as the dividend rate has
been raised in each year from 1959/60
except in the last year of 1963/64.
During that year a rights issue was
made. It could be felt that the company’s
results are dependent to a large extent
on prosperity in the “outback” of New
South Wales. While this must certainly
have some bearing, it does seem that the
company's results have not, over the
last seven years, been affected by such
fluctuations.
Since 1961 the issued capital of John
Meagher (Holdings) has been expanded
by the acquisition of McGlynn and Co.
Pty Ltd in early 1961, then by a one-
for-four rights issue in early 1964, and
finally by another acquisition in May,
1964. The issues other than to existing
shareholders have been quite small.
From the chairman’s address of October,
1963, it would seem that the policy of
the board is to raise funds from share-
holders rather than from outside sources.
The only outside source of funds until
that time was an issue of £lOO,OOO re-
deemable preference shares and now
that this issue has been repaid the com-
pany is dependent solely on shareholders’
funds for its long term capital needs.
According to the 1963 balance sheet,
liabilities to the bank and to trade and
other creditors total about £290,000,
while trade and other debtors plus cash
amounted to nearly £254,000. This sug-
gests that John Meagher must be one
of the most liquid of the retailers which
have placed increased reliance in recent
years not only on short term finance
outside the banking system and normal
trade creditors, but also on sales under
instalment credit arrangements frequent-
ly extending beyond twelve months.
In other words, John Meagher seems
to be a true retailer and not a retailer
cum financier. Despite this difference,
it may be interesting to compare some
relevant factors from the investor’s view-
point with those of other well-known
retailers. An index of per share earn-
ings would appear as follows after
adjustments for cash and bonus issues:
Comoany 1958 1961 1962 1963 1964
David Jones 100 134 124 131 141
Myer Emporium 100 126 163 171 n.a.
Waltons 100 125 124 141 146
John Meagher 100 129 156 162 180
A similar index on the basis of divi-
dends per share is also of interest, since
earnings are significant to an investor
in so far as they are an indication of
the direction of future dividend payout.
In other words, one can hardly have in-
creasing dividends without increasing
earnings, though it is possible to have
increasing earnings without any increase
in dividends. The dividend per share in-
dex, adjusted on the same basis as for
earnings, is as follows:
Company 1958 1961 1962 1963 1964
David Jones 100 131 135 147 147
Myer Emporium 100 128 151 151 151
Waltons 100 108 108 114 114
John Meagher 100 125 141 156 168
These figures indicate that in terms
of dividend growth John Meagher is
better than the others. Pending the
announcement of the 1963/64 profits of
the Myer Emporium it looks as though
John Meagher will be ahead on earnings
too. Yet when one looks at the current
share levels, the prices, etc., appear as
follows:
Company 1964 Last Dividend Earnings
Range Sale Yield % Yield %
David Jones 23/6-19/8 20/3 3.1 5.7
Myer Emporium 38/7-33/8 35/- 2.4 n.a.
Waltons 18/3-12/10 13/- 4.8 8.2
John Meagher 15/6-13/6 14/- 4.5 7.5
From these figures one would judge
that John Meagher appears under-priced,
but many would find it difficult to give
the company the investment rating of
David Jones and Myer Emporium. The
following index of the return on total
capital might perhaps increase their
confidence:

There seems little doubt that in terms
of most profitability ratios John Meagher
has performed well over the last five
years. It seems to be in a strong posi-
tion financially, as it has little depend-
ence on outside finance and does not
appear to have relied extensively on
“credit retailing” to maintain its profit
levels.
The shares seem good buying at prices
up to 15s. 6d., even disregarding the
possibility of an eventual takeover as
was mentioned at the beginning of this
article.
More from Malleys
An 86 p.c. profit leap by Malleys Ltd
had very little effect on the share-
market. After announcing a profit of
£309,715 and a higher dividend investors
barely acknowledged it by adding 9d.
to shares to make them 365.
Earning rate on capital increased by
issues to Whirlpool Corporation of Ame-
rica rises from 10 to 16.4 p.c. Tax
jumps from £83,589 to £268,306 and
depreciation from £162,900 to £243,779.
Two new provisions, doubtful debts
(£18,937) and warranty service
(£20,144) are included in the latest
unaudited result.

Worth Buying to Hold
National Bag in expanding industry
During 1963-64, the National Bag Co.
of Australia Limited brought two
more subsidiaries under its wing. Now
it is the non-trading parent of eleven
offspring in all—six incorporated in Vic-
toria, four in NSW and one in WA.
The takeover of Victoria’s Thermo-
plastics Pty Ltd and its WA subsidiary
gave paid capital its first boost since
1959-60, when shareholders partook of
a one-for-four par issue. This has been
their only capital benefit from the com-
pany in its entire fourteen-year history.
Thermoplastics manufactures plastic hose
and piping. The Victorian activities
have been transferred to the group’s head
office premises in North Road, East
Bentleigh, while the WA operations have
been left as they are.
The new subsidiary joins with four
other organisations to form the nucleus
of the group’s business. Abrahams Paper
Sacks turns out multiwall paper sacks
from works at Alexandria in Sydney,
Rocklea in Brisbane, and from the East
Bentleigh premises. A. Abrahams and
Sons produces numerous jute products,
plastic and calico bags, and wrapping
materials from Fitzroy in Melbourne and
the same Sydney and Brisbane plants. A
sub-subsidiary, Abrahams Flexible Pack-
aging, manufactures all the group’s
polythene bags and sheets at the East
Bentleigh works. Corrugated paper and
cartons are also turned out there.
The fourth unit is Colortex Fabrics,
which acts as a roller and screen fabric
printer, dyer, bleacher, and finisher of
all fabrics. Its operations are also
centred at East Bentleigh. The remain-
ing members are Cooks River Storage
(NSW), General Dye Colours (Vic.), Jute
Traders (NSW), Pretty Prints (NSW),
Rayon Silk and Calico Printers of Aus-
tralia (Vic.) and Robert Morton and
Sons (Vic.).
A. Abrahams and Sons was the
original subsidiary, a plain bag and sack
manufacturer, in which National Bag
placed all its interest after formation in
June, 1950. Today, the Abrahams family
hold five seats out of seven made avail-
able for directors. The other two direc-
tors, M. E. Farley and J. G. Donaldson,
may have family connections. Anyway,
'egardless of these two, the Abrahams
alone hold a substantial number of the
ss. shares.
Jf it wasn’t for their strong grip on
the company’s share structure, a take-
over bid would no doubt have been
successful long ago. But it’s not much
use going to the shareholders in this
case, or even just announcing a bid to
the market, as, without the Abrahams’
approval, success would be virtually im-
possible.
There have been numerous takeover
rumors for National Bag in past years.
The mere fact that the company is such
a ripe plum for anyone diversifying or
someone merely expanding accounted for
many of the rumors. In some cases at
least the rumors had definite grounding,
as a firm had approached or was con-
templating an approach to the formid-
able Abrahams.
Just now, negotiations are on again.
At the annual meeting on September 14
the chairman, Mr L. J. Abrahams, said
no firm offer had been made and that
negotiations could take another week,
maybe a month, but would certainly be
completed this year. His advice is “don’t
sell”. After the rumor-ridden price
fluctuations of recent times, shareholders
can’t help but be sceptical. It has to be
admitted, though, that this current round
is definitely the most promising yet.
/I ctually the shares are probably a
good buy now, to stick away and
forget. At around 245. they yield only 2.1
p.c. from the dividend, so they're no good
for income purposes. This price is still be-
low the 265. 3d. peak reached when the
takeover negotiations were announced.
As the Abrahams drive a hard bargain,
any successful takeover price would
probably still leave a margin of capital
profit if the shares were bought now.
On the other hand, there’s no need to
despair if takeover is unsuccessful and
the shares ease back—as long as they’ve
been bought to be put away and for-
gotten. One of these days, directors are
going to consider shareholders in a more
generous way than they have to date.
Only one par issue from such a success-
ful company in its entire history is an
extremely poor record. If takeover is
unsuccessful, then an issue could be very
close at hand.
There are two reasons for thinking
this. Firstly, the company’s working
capital, though satisfactory, is down con-
siderably on previous years (see table).
Directors may feel that extra cash is
needed to make full use of all oppor-
tunities and, with a buoyant 1964-65
ahead, they could probably employ extra
capital without any trouble. The second
reason has been hammered ever since
assets were revalued in 1960-61. Now
the point is sharper than ever. Paid
capital, at only £778,000, is only half
the reserves of £1,531,000 a one-for-
one bonus would be no trouble.
However, this would not be done as
it could reduce the earning rate drasti-
cally (25.8 p.c. in 1963-64). Something
like a two-for-three would be more
feasible, since it would enable a steady
10 p.c. dividend to be still very
adequately covered. Then again, as
liquid funds may be desirable, a com-
bined par or premium issue, together
with a bonus to give shareholders more
of the healthy financial past than just
a 10 p.c. dividend, is even more feasible.
All this conjecture is merely by-the-
by, anyway. The essential point is
this. The shares are worth buying—a
solid company in an expanding industry
with, on overseas experience, a promising
future. One only buys at the current
high price if prepared to take a punt
on the takeover outcome. If it fails, one
must be prepared to forget the scrip for
a while. If sceptical about takeover
prospects (as most informed observers
seem to be), then hang back until the
shares recede to a level which looks
more reasonable and buy them with the
idea of hanging on until new issue day.
The table below shows nothing spec-
tacular apart from what has already been
mentioned, just a steady, solid history.
Fixed assets have continued to grow
since the revaluation. Intangible assets
could have been written down, but
directors have seen fit to leave them be.
Loan capital shows a healthy downward
trend. Profits are not far short of the
all-time 1962 high and earning rates are
buoyant historically. The post-dividend
profit surplus is back to a high level
and adding further to reserves, while the
falling dividend yield reflects the upward
trend of the share price during the
19605.

PITT, SON AND BAPGERY LTD
Lock Away for a Bonus
HThe 1963-64 year was a particularly
A good one for the pastoral industry
generally. So it was no surprise that
Pitt, Son and Badgery Ltd turned in a
record result for the year. What did sur-
prise, however, was that the company
had not yet announced another bonus
issue.
Pitt, Son has a long history, going
back 76 years. Its generosity in the form
of bonus issues has been remarkable.
The company was formed in 1888 to
take over a business conducted under
the same name. Stock exchange listing
was obtained in 1907 with a paid-up
capital of £55,000 in 100,000 20s. shares
paid to 1 Is.
No cash calls were made on share-
holders between then and 1957, when
the company made an issue of convertible
notes. Capital was lifted to £499,196 by
bonus issues —l4 in all.
The note issue, which carried 7 p.c.
interest, raised £166,398 and had a cur-
rency of five years, converting into ordin-
ary shares at par on January 1, 1963.
Directors indicated that no bonus issue
would be made during the currency of
the notes, which matured in the com-
pany’s 75th year of operation.
The company, which confines most of
its activities to New South Wales, like
other wool broking groups, acts as a
quasi-banker to the man on the land.
Clients and other debtors appear in the
books at £1,828,967 £71,238 higher
than in the previous year but still well
below the £1,925,573 of 1961-62.
Although the man on the land has
had good times for several years past,
the industry nevertheless is not without
its bad debts. Provision for doubtful
debts is up from £18.458 to £29,628.
Bank overdraft is down from £462,703
to £175,137, clients and trade creditors
up from £276,870 to £597,894.
Pitt, Son now occupies fourth place in
the woolbroking groups, after Golds-
brough Mort-Elder Smith, Dalgety-NZ
Loan and Winchcombe Carson.
With woolbroking the principal part
of the company’s activity, it is not sur-
prising that a 10 p.c. lift in the number
of wool bales sold and a higher average
price resulted in a record profit.
Dividend on the ordinary shares has
been held at 13 p.c. for the past six years,
and includes a bonus element of 5 p.c.
The shares are currently selling around
335. 9d., to show a dividend yield of 3,8
p.c. and an earnings yield of 6 p.c.
They can well be locked away, for the
company’s long bonus distribution history
is not yet over.
W. C. PENFOLD HOLDINGS LTD
Facing a Difficult Year
Oydney-based W. C. Penfold Holdings
Ltd was able to reverse a three-year
downward trend in profit during 1963-
64. However the company still has a
considerable way to go to reach the levels
achieved in 1960 and 1961.
Penfold has a very long history, pos-
sibly as long as any other Australian
company listed on the Sydney Stock
Exchange.
It traces its beginnings back to a
printing and engraving business begun
by William Moffitt in King Street in
1830. Some of Moffitt’s works are still
preserved in the company’s archives.
W. C. Penfold Holdings was formed in
1950 and concurrently with an issue of
378,365 shares to the vendors of the
operating company, W. C. Penfold and
Co. Pty Ltd, issued 121.628 10s. shares
to the public at par. In addition, 50,000
5 p.c. 20s. preference shares were placed
privately. Paid capital on listing was
£250,000.
Although 178,384 shares were issued
between 1952 and 1953 to acquire assets,
only one call has been made on share-
holders—in 1959, a one-for-two issue of
7 p.c. notes convertible into ordinary
shares at par on July 1, 1965. These
ranked equally with ordinary shares for
issues during their currency.

Once upon a time
man believed that there
were only Jour elements...
one of these was -AIR.
But what is air? Can we see it can we touch it? Air is a
combination of gases...some beneficial, some noxious...
perfectly blended and balanced to provide an atmosphere in
which man, beast and plant can live together. Air as a sub-
stance, allows aeroplanes to transport heavy loads far and-
fast. As an elastic substance that carries the vibrations of
sound, it provides us with one of our most precious gifts...
the ability to hear. Air, as wind, changes the temperature,
removes dust and smoke, and brings the rain. C.I.G. collects,
compresses, and liquefies air, then draws off oxygen, xenon,
krypton, argon, nitrogen and neon gases for many and varied
medical and industrial applications.

THERE'S A C.I.G. PROCESS TO HELP YOUR INDUSTRY!
Ordinary dividend has been held at
10 p.c. every year since flotation,
although in 1962-63 earnings failed to
cover the payout by a considerable mar-
gin. The company’s peak year was in
1959-60, when profit was £67,767, equal
to 19 p.c. on capital.
For the three succeeding years, pro-
fit showed a steady decline, falling 60
p.c. to £26,887 in 1963, equal to 7.5 p.c.
on capital. Profit failed to cover the
dividend payout by £8957.
In the latest year, however, profit
staged a fair recovery and rose to
£50,125, equal to 14 p.c. on capital,
though it was still the second lowest
profit for 10 years.
The company is particularly strong in
reserves. Following a revaluation of
Hosking House, the main city office and
factory, an assets reserve of £245,593
was created. A capital reserve of
£68,724 has been in the books since
1953.
Although the company has intangibles,
chiefly goodwill on consolidation, of
£122,404 in the books, revenue reserves
lift total shareholders’ funds to
£1,079,900, giving the 10s. ordinary
shares a net assets backing of 265. 9d.
The latest accounts reflect the im-
proved trading position of the company.
Stock is up slightly from £374,247 to
£390,452, while trade debtors are up
from £163,445 to £210,747. At the
same time, bank overdraft is down from
£210,588 to £139,316.
When the convertible notes mature at
the end of the current year, paid-up
ordinary capital will become £537,663,
requiring a good boost in earnings in the
1965-66 year to maintain the 10 p.c.
dividend payout.
The current year will not be an easy
one for the company, although early
figures indicate satisfactory trading re-
sults. Next year will be even harder.
The shares are currently selling around
17s. to show a dividend yield of 5.9 p.c.

SPECULATORS DIARY
On Not Being a Chairman
How to vent public views of the market
rpwo ways in which you can publicly
express your viewpoint on the market
are by being chairman of a public com-
pany, or a journalist.
In recent weeks, we’ve had two south-
ern gentlemen, in their capacities of
chairmen of public companies, giving
their opinion on the market. Both do-
minate rival stockbroking firms, so it’s
simply the views of those firms.
For some years now I myself have been
open to offers for the chairmanship of
any investment company. Nary a one!
So I’m forced to behave like a journalist
and express my views in that capacity.
It’s certainly not a case for wholesale
panic. The market has had the edge
taken off it. There are still plenty of op-
portunities for those who don’t follow
the masses. Basically, if you can pick a
company that is going to increase profits
this year, then you won’t go too far
wrong. In the past, share prices have
followed remarkably closely to profit
trends. This should apply equally in the
future.
Those companies that have taken on
a new lease of life look particularly
interesting. Malleys is such a case. With
the weight of the Whirlpool Corporation
of the US behind it, the company is
moving ahead very strongly. Even in a
year when record results are the accepted
thing, Malleys’ performance is highly
pleasing. Not many companies can boast
of almost tripling their pre-tax profits
and doubling their after-tax profits. Pro-
vided the Government doesn’t become
silly by announcing a “little Budget”, in-
creasing sales tax on appliances, this
should be “Appliance Year”.
Last week, I was expressing dismay
about the sudden fall in Malleys shares
from 395. 6d. to 355. 6d. I’ve since
been told by the chartists that this price
was well above the trend line and a fall
was to be expected. As this fall satisfies
the chartists and the 1963-64 result
satisfies the fundamentalists, what better
reasons for increasing my holding by
200.
A much bigger purchase this week was
1000 Kolotex at 14s. 9d. The obvious
question is: “Why buy a stock that has
just been sold out of the portfolio at a
loss?” The answer lies in the annual
report, which has just been published.
Refreshing your memory, Kolotex
Holdings Ltd was formed from the shell
of Rosslyn Hosiery (Holdings) Ltd in
1962. For some years prior to this, Ross-
lyn Hosiery Ltd had been struggling and
had, in fact, by then incurred substantial
tax losses.
Under the new Kolotex management,
earning rate has risen from 16 p.c. in
1962 to 53 p.c. in 1963, and now 79
p.c. in 1964.
My reservations about the company
were the low tax provisions and its
under-capitalisation at the time of the
changeover (external liabilities were
four times greater than shareholders’
funds in 1962). Since 1962, directors’
policy has been ultra-conservative. But
■t took the 1964 balance sheet finally to
convince me.
In the short space of two years, the
plant has been written down by £205,000
to £133,000. Expressed another way,
although the company has spent £258,000
on new plant in the last two years, the
net book value of the plant has only
risen from £80,000 to £133,000. It seems
fair to assume that purchase of this new
plant was spread equally over each
financial period. This being so, the an-
nual rate of depreciation is about 40 p.c,
Depreciation rates for other hosiery
manufacturers appear to be around the
10 p.c. level!
I now more than accept the directors’
statement that there has been additional
depreciation charged and that it is equal
to the tax that normally would have been
paid. On the point of over-capitalisation,
the 1964 balance sheet shows that share-
holders’ funds are not much less than ex-
ternal liabilities — the low dividend rate
in the past has helped the build-up of
these funds.
From an unlikely beginning, Kolotex
has been moulded into a very strong
company. Directors are already talking
about a marked improvement in trading
this year, and also openly hint at an issue
later this year.
To provide revenue for my purchases
I sold off part of my Conkeys holding.
There’s a complete loss of interest here
though I’m prepared to sit it out with the
balance. The loss here was £15.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
1000 Conkeys 14/6 £712
BOUGHT
200 Malleys 36/- £366
1000 Kolotex 14/9 £753
At the end of the week I am left in
debt to the amount of £454.
The portfolio now is:


THE MAN
ON THE LAND
What of Wool Productivity?
The basis of future prosperity
llfooL marketing and wool promotion
’* are two items which are now,
and have been for some time, very much
in the spotlight. But what of wool pro-
ductivity?
There is a tendency to regard produc-
tivity as something which the back-room
boys play around with and which does
not directly concern the man on the land.
In reality it seems fair to say that pro-
ductivity is the key to wool’s future
prosperity. If there is not enough wool
to sell, then it will not matter how it
is sold or how it is promoted.
This needs, perhaps, a word of ex-
planation, particularly for people unfami-
liar with the wool business.
In the case of most products, the less
there is then the higher the price. It
therefore might seem that woolgrowers
would be playing it smart if they deliber-
ately restricted output —or kept it at
the present level. But there is no way
of justifying such a policy in the case of
wool.
In spite of all we hear about it, and
in spite of its importance to this country,
wool has still only about 9 p.c. of the
world fibre market. In Western countries
the proportion would be higher but for
the fact that the great mass of the world’s
population wears clothes made out of
cotton.
Wool, therefore, has a market before
it that is wide open, provided it can be
produced at a price which people can
pay. The danger, if wool production does
not go up, is that it will price itself out of
the market just as natural silk priced
itself out some 30 years ago.
Synthetic fibres, it is said by many,
are poised to take over wool’s share
should wool vacate the market. This may
not be really the case, as the making of
synthetic fibres requires large industrial
plants and skilled personnel. Synthetics
have a price problem of their own. Cer-
tainly the threat from synthetics is there,
even if it may not be the bogey that is
sometimes claimed.
As most people are aware, the aim of
the Wool Board's promotion campaign
is to give wool a “quality image”. Some
£l2 million will be spent on promotion,
compared with about £3 million on pro-
ductivity research. It cannot be argued
that the Wool Board is unaware of the
value of productivity research. It might,
however, be argued that promotion is
being over-emphasised.
The Wool Board's report to the Com-
monwealth Parliament discloses the areas
in which productivity research is going
on with Wool Board (i.e., growers plus
Government) funds. What it does not dis-
close is the lack of co-ordination in these
projects.
A number of Commonwealth agencies
(such as the CSIRO), together with a
wider range of State agencies (the de-
partments of agriculture, the universities
and specialised institutes) get funds.
Some of these agencies are duplicating
each other’s activities, some are going
ahead on quite independent tracks, some
might be said to be hardly giving value
for money.
The biggest problem of all is getting
across to the woolgrower the findings
of the scientists. Some Wool Board
people are very much aware of this
shortcoming in the overall research pro-
gramme. They have very sound ideas on
how it might be corrected.
At present, though, dissemination of
productivity knowledge gets scant atten-
tion compared with the energies and the
funds devoted to spreading the promotion
gospel. It's there all right, but it shows as
a faint glimpse of gold in a mountain
of gravel.
The Wool Board's director of produc-
tion research, Dr George Moule, is at
present in Italy attending the Fifth Inter-
national Congress of Animal Production
and a symposium on livestock infertility
being held by the Food and Agriculture
Organisation of the United Nations. He
will spend some time also in the Middle
East and India investigating livestock
problems.
Some weeks ago, Dr Moule made
some extremely interesting remarks on
W'ool productivity which, because of the
marketing issue, did not get the attention
they perhaps deserved. He prefaced his
remarks with high praise for the work
being done by Dr Bob Dun, of the
Trangie research station, and the CSIRO
laboratory at Prospect.
Dr Moule said that there was now a
tremendous amount of information avail-
able that could lead to very large in-
creases in the reproduction rates of Mer-
ino sheep in Australia. In one experi-
mental flock in North Queensland, for
example, 100 ewes had produced 162
lambs (many had twins). This compared
with an average of 70 lambs from 100
ewes on most properties at present.
The high lambing rate in the experi-
mental flock had been achieved by care-
ful management and choosing the right
time to mate the ewes to the rams. An-
other factor was the association between
excessive wrinkles in Merino sheep and
low lambing percentages. By culling
wrinkly sheep, it might be possible to
raise the lambing percentage of a flock.
Dr Moule admitted that in choosing
the right time to mate the ewes the
farmer often had to make a compromise.
He had to consider, as well as the sheep,
the market, harvesting, and his own per-
sonal convenience. Feeding also was of
great importance. If the farmer could
feed his sheep well, he could manage
them just about any way he wanted to.
Farmers would agree with this observa-
tion by Dr Moule. Unfortunately many
farmers are not in a position to pick and
choose when it comes to feed. They have
to make do as best they can with what
they have got. Not every farmer can af-
ford perfect pastures. But many, if they
are willing to try, can improve their past-
ures a great deal.
Again, however, it is not always a
case of apathy. Some types of country
would require a king's ransom to have
sown down in improved pastures.
VTeither the Wool Board nor the Inter-
national Wool Secretariat has yet
come up with a finance plan to permit
large scale pasture improvement. Some
observers believe it would be better to
spend £l2 million this way, in the form
of loans, than on promoting the finished
article for the direct benefit, in the main,
of overseas manufacturers.
The bounty on superphosphate, pro-
vided by the Commonwealth Govern-
ment, is a start in this direction and an
extremely valuable one. If loans, for
various reasons, are not practical, then
bounties on items used for pasture im-
provement might be extended.
Every now and again one hears about
schemes to open up new areas for sheep
grazing in Australia. This too is a double-
header. There are no really new areas in
which sheep have never before been
tried. In the great pastoral expansion of
last century in Australia, the squatters
pushed sheep into every corner of this
continent that permitted an animal with
four legs to stand up.
But there are areas in which sheep
were tried and where they did badly,

cost too much to maintain, or perished
altogether. With scientific advances some
of these areas could probably be utilised
more efficiently now.
Dr Moule made the very pertinent
point that a revolutionary extension of
grazing areas depended largely on getting
water to these areas. No one could expect
people to work in hard country, risking
a large amount of effort and capital if
that country did not receive rainfall.
Much could be done by producing new
plants and introducing new plants to
certain areas.
However, the big necessity at the mo-
ment was to increase production in those
areas already running sheep, Dr Moule
considered.
Human populations had increased
much more quickly than the rate of in-
crease in wool production. In conse-
quence, wool’s share of the market had
fallen from 14 p.c. pre-war to 9 p.c. now.
The international rate of increase in wool
production was about 1.5 p.c. per year.
Human populations were increasing much
more quickly than this. If wool did not
clothe these people some other fibre
would.
New Zealand was showing what could
be done. Mainly through improved pas-
tures, New Zealand had lifted sheep num-
bers from 30 million to 50 million in
the last 10 years and, in the next 10
years, hoped to increase the total to
70 million.
Dr Moule estimates there are some 60
million acres of Australian sheep country
which has sound potential for pasture im-
provement. Sheep numbers in Australia,
now 164 million, should be increased
to 200 million.
Scientists like Dr Moule, and Dr Dun,
obviously have too much on their hands
to be responsible for telling the farmer
in detail how he can make use of their
research discoveries.
The Department of Primary Industry
has plans for improved extension services
for farming generally, so has the Wool
Board, so have the State departments of
agriculture and the universities. There is
a big task ahead here. It will require an
integrated effort.
If all station hands were university
graduates it would not be so hard. They
aren’t and are not likely to be. Many a
progressive farmer has run up against
this problem. He tells his men how to go
about doing something in a new way and,
the minute his back is turned, they revert
to the way they always did it. City
professional men who go into farming
with intelligent theories and much capi-
tal often discover this also.
One man we know, on the best advice,
determined to change from spring to
autumn lambing. The attempt ended in
fiasco because the farm staff were simply
unable to adjust their routine to the new
method. Needless to say, this particular
man lost a lot of money in his farming
venture.
It goes without saying that the farmer
is not the only man involved, at the
grass roots level, in lifting wool pro-
duction. Much wastage which occurs in
baling, transport, and shipping might be
avoided and useful research is going on
in these spheres.
The new Tally Hi method of shear-
ing, sponsored by the Wool Board, is
quite a spectacular success story in its
own right. It has been estimated that up
to five million pounds of wool a year gets
into bales with pieces of skin adhering
to it. These skin-pieces have to be dis-
carded in the cleaning and scouring pro-
cess. The Tally Hi method helps the
shearer to avoid taking off bits of skin
with the wool. The sheep, without doubt,
approve.
If the marketing and promotion issues,
which have attendant political aspects,
can be settled, the wool industry really
must get cracking on productivity.
An illustration, of somewhat grave im-
plications, was the recent Albury wool
sales. Albury is centred in an area be-
coming rapidly pasture-improvement con-
scious and 40 p.c. of the catalogue
was comeback and crossbred wool. Prices
were firm, but the point is that overseas
textile manufacturers are stressing that
what they want is quality Merino wool.
Why are they paying good prices for
crossbred wool? There are two answers
and you can take your pick.
One is that they find crossbred wool
just as useful for their purposes as Mer-
ino. The other is that they are not pre-
pared to pay a premium for Merino. In
other words it is ALREADY pricing it-
self too high.
Whichever answer is correct, and it
may be a combination of each, it appears
that intensified activity in the field of
productivity research (and extension) is
urgent.
Maybe it is a bit early to tell, the sell-
ing season has only just started, yet there
seems something strange going on when
crossbred wools (the cheaper wools) im-
prove by lid. a pound and Merino
improves by only two pence a pound.
Australia supplies 80 p.c. of the
world’s Merino wool, but as a crossbred
producer is just one of many. If the
world textile manufacturers are setting
out to utilise crossbred wools in order to
produce woollen fabrics at the cheapest
possible cost (leaving Merino for the
luxury trade) then this country could be
in for trouble.
There will be some woolgrowers who
will retort that this theory is rubbish,
that there is no substitute for good quality
Merino wool. Well, as we said before,
you can take your pick.
Country Petrol Prices
Bulk deliveries lead to “nice” discounts
rPHE chaff bin on the Australian farm
has long been replaced by the petrol
drum. There is still much chaff being
blown around, though, on the subject of
country petrol prices.
The facts of the matter are that few
farmers these days pay the full price for
their petrol, diesel fuel, lubricating oil
and kerosene. Bulk deliveries to farms
have increased at a great rate over the
last five years. When you buy in bulk
you get a nice discount.
The system works this way. The farmer
signs a contract with a petrol company
to buy, usually for five years, all his
petroleum needs from that company. The
company in turn erects a 500-gallon tank
(maybe a bigger one) on the property,
complete with service-station type pump
and containers for oil, grease, diesel fuel
and so on.
The discounts vary from district to dis-
trict and from product to product. To
take an example, super petrol, which
sells in most big cities at 3s. Bd., is, offi-
cially, in country districts as high as
4s. 2d., or even 4s. 6d. in the real out-
back.
In many parts of Victoria, South Aus-
tralia, NSW and Queensland the price
on the bulk delivery basis often matches
the city price, 3s. Bd. It is nearly always
at least 4d. a gallon cheaper than the
ruling price in the nearest town.
There has been a “farm tank” war
going on similar to the “service station’
wars with which Sydney and Melbourne
residents are familiar. Some canny farm-
ers have done pretty well out of it.
One big user we know resisted offers
from all the petrol companies. He held
out for a 2000 gallon tank, two separate

his way and now has a service station all
to himself.
He is still moaning, however. He
reckons he should have a hydraulic lift
for greasing and repairs. None of the
companies were prepared to go that far
for him.
Collectively the farm, use of petro-
leum products of all kinds would not
compare with the consumption of a capi-
tal city. But individually farmers are big
users.
The average city motorist perhaps buys
500 gallons of petrol a year. A great
many farmers are in the 2000 to 3000
gallons bracket. Some of the really big
mechanised farms use more than 6000
gallons.
It is all tax deductible, too, which
means that, all things considered, the
farmer has not got much to complain
about.
Now, however, there are strong rumors
of a “rationalisation” plan by the petrol
companies. Some farmers have urged
their producer organisations to make a
thorough investigation of the situation.
In Victoria, it appears that Shell and
BP have come to some sort of agree-
ment whereby Shell will serve the west-
ern half of the State, through Portland,
and BP the eastern half, through the new
tanker berth being built in Western Port
Bay. Other companies are said to be
negotiating for a guernsey on one, or
other, of the “rationalisation” football
teams, so to speak.
From the petrol companies’ point of
view it makes sense. Up till now two
adjoining farms, both maybe 200 miles
from a common source, have needed two
separate delivery systems. Magnify this
and it is possible to visualise big road
tankers criss-crossing the State in order
to supply hundreds of farms.
From the farmers’ point of view the
new plan might be okay, provided it is
not the thin end of the wedge in a plan
to lift the prices. It is competition which
has got the farmer the excellent servicing
facilities and the prices he now enjoys.
One petrol is pretty much the same as
another. If there are guarantees on prices,
the petrol companies may not get a great
deal of opposition to this “rationalisation”
plan. However the plan develops, one
thing needs to be stressed. The promise
of the Commonwealth Government to
stabilise country petrol prices (a favorite
topic of the Country Party) has meaning
largely only to the non-farming residents
of country towns. It is this fellow who is
missing out. The farmer is doing all right,
really.
Tasmania’s Flourishing Dairies
Moves to combat mastitis
Oince the time of Australia’s first
settlement, Tasmania, as the Com-
monwealth’s smallest and most isolated
State, has mostly been considered a bit
of an underdog. Yet something always
happens to give the State a boost in the
eyes of its mainland counterparts.
Usually this has been in the form of
political scandals. More worthy of a
spotlight is Tasmania's dairying industry.
The Australian Society of Dairy
Technology held its 20th annual confer-
ence in Launceston. Premier Reece
packed delegates back to their home
laboratories full of admiration for Tas-
mania’s dairymen.
In 1955, Tasmania had a dairy indus-
try. It also had the Commonwealth’s
smallest population. Tasmania, though,
could not produce enough butter to meet
its own domestic needs. The smallest
State was dependent on other States for
supplies.
Now it’s a different story. Tasmania
exports butter. Last year, these exports
were 10 p.c. of the Commonwealth
total. The present value of the industry
for a population of 360,000 is £lO mil-
lion— about the total of its pastoral and
meat industries.
The “Cinderella” industry is racing
neck and neck with the fruit industry for
second place in the rural export premier-
ship. Since the Society of Dairy Tech-
nology was formed in 1944, Tasmania’s
dairy cattle population has risen a stag-
gering 90 p.c., compared with the
Commonwealth average increase of six
p.c.
With these gentle reminders, Mr Reece
left the technologists to their lunch —a
feast notable for the complete absence
of butter and the inferior quality of its
cheese.
As the conference got into its stride,
the technologists had discussions that
produced interesting news for Australian
dairymen. The most important was a
move aimed at putting £lO million into
the bank accounts of dairymen.
This, the technologists say, can come
from a nation-wide eradication pro-
gramme for mastitis. The society pre-
sident (Mr W. J. Crews) said it was time
for changed thinking on mastitis. In
the past mastitis had been treated as a
disease rather than as a stumbling block
to full dairy production.
“There is evidence that a more
modern approach to milking-shed prac-
tice is needed if we are to reduce the
significance of this disease,” said Mr
Crews.
