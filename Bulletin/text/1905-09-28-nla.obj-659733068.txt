iO ENA TOR KEATIN G, moving in the Senate,
KJ s / econd wading of the Copyright Bill,
said (Hansard, 1427) :
I wish honorable senators to bear in minH „n n.
Imperial enactments [relative to copyriffht l,ave

right law of a British possession ifonly

This statement is incomplete and possibly mis-
leading. Had Senator Keating said :
«ffanft C i? Pyri u ht ! a "i of a British possession has force and
effect throughout that possession, and all these Imperial
enactments are on v supplemental to or concurrent with
the legislation of the possession. '
he might have left a juster impression regarding
the relevant question (i.e., the validity and ex°
tension of Commonwealth legislation): though the
suggested statement also would have been incom
plete and possibly misleading. ° m '
Between these incomplete statements there is
difference of the point of view, and the point of
view is important. Senator Keating, drafting hi
J," largely upon the lines bv
the British Commission of 1878, unfortunately
seems to have taken the view-less of a Minister
if Australia legislating for the benefit of Australia
-ban—-of a resident of Britain legislating for the
ienefit of residents of Britain. °
f these enactments have ” not (actu-

n the first case the Imperial Parliament (e.q., by
f Constitution Acts of Canada and Australia)
as created a copyright status independent of the
-atus created by the Imperial Copyright Acts.
In the second case ( c.g ., Canada) a separate
ipynght sub-status dependent from the Imperial
nts has been created by Order in Council based
’mu Colonial Copyright Act, 1847.
Ihe Constitutions of Canada and Australia, and
e Imperial Copyright Acts, receive authority
[ually from the Imperial Parliament. The
pynght legislation of Canada and Australia
ide in exercise of a power expressly conferred
the Constitution, mounts to the same source as
penai copyright legislation, and in its specific
Id should be paramount. 1
That is not the law decided. But it is a terrible
3ory of the law which, on the
tutional right should be fought for at e.crv
portunity—as Canada has fought for it.
Senator Keating’s Un- Australian
Choice.
ie liluM ng ’, Cal J ed Upon to choose whether
Bin should rely (as in Canada) upon the
ependent authority of the Constitution or
ether it should follow humbly in dependence
m the British Copyright Acts, has made the
Australian choice. His Bill declares the
•lication of English common law, which is
eed a sound basis for statutory construction •
declares also that nothing the Bill contains’
U take away from Imperial statutory pro
-ion—which is an admission that the Common-
.lth is unworthy to exercise the right of self-
tection conferred upon it by the Constitution
Canadian Law to Protect Canada—and
Australian Law (?) to Protect Spain.
Senator Keating added (1427) that
,f e Berne Convention, the'imperial Act of 1886 and
Ac - ts -’ DOW ai ’l )l - v throughout the whole of
the British Dominions. The result is that if in sav

This also is an incomplete statement. In
Sonaßv i “ respect , of copyright constitu-

Canadian copyright only if he comply with the
I law of copyright: i.e., if his book be registered in
Canada simultaneously with publication in Spain
and be printed and published (or reprinted and
republished) in. Canada within one month of pub
m Spain. (49 Vic. c. 4, secs. 5,7, 13).

right was repeated to Canadian residents, an^to
British subjects resident in Great Britain and
Ireland (sec. 1) who should print and publish in
the Province (see. 7). Foreign reprints of British
copyright books were admitted on payment o
duty (sec. 15), and nothing was to prohibit t
importation or printing of works written by pc
sons not residing in Canada and not being Britis
subjects residing in Great Britain or Ireland.
This Act remained in force for nine years. In 1867 t
confederated provinces of North America became t
i ominion of Canada, and next year the Canadian; Pari
nient repealed the Provincial Act of 1859 and faced t
position that the Commonwealth is facing- now.
'that did the Canadian Parliament do? Did it pi
another Act on the “ incongruous,” “ barely intelligible
British Acts of that date ? It did not. It availed itself o
the express authority of the Constitution to pass ind
pendent Acts designed in the first place for the protectio
and benefit of Canadians.
10. In 1808 an Act of the Dominion (31 Vic
c. 54) repeated (sec. 3) the provision of the Pro
vineial Act of 1847 granting copyright only 1
residents of Canada, and to (British subjects res:
dent in Great Britain or Ireland who should prin
and publish in Canada (sec. 9). At the same tim
another Act (31 Vic., c. 50), kept separate fo
convenience, admitted foreign reprints of Britis
copyright books on payment of duty as they wer
admitted by the Provincial Act of 1850 ; and si
iocoi * ater t ' vo British Orders in Council (July 7
1808) approved the Act, and a second time sus
Act ied the prohibitions of the British Copyrigh
The Resebved Act of 1575.
Seven years later came the Act of 8 April, 1875, which
was reserved by the Governor-General because (as the
ari»nt-h C tr R August, 1875, recited) “doubts have
arisen w hether the said reserved Bill may not be repug
iiant to t,ne sued Order in Council ” of 7 July, 1868 : and
b 7 ea removed by the British Act,
was asseuted-to 26 October, 1875.

L ; olll Petitive foreign reprints of the same
woiks should be prohibited. But the IS6B Order in

of a woik lepruited both in Canada and elsewhere, the
Older in Council might admit where the Canadian Act
fho c; i ' Collse 1 c l“ e “ t, y, “doubts have arisen whether
the said reserved Bill may not be repugnant to the said
Older in Council. But Canada still desired to retain
the Order in Council in order to admit foreign reprints
not reprinted in Canada; and a fresh Order in Council
could not under the authorising Act of 1847 be framed to
meet the case. Besides, the muddled Act of 1842 had not
contemplated the case of separate copyright in a British
possession, and it was necessary to prohibit the importa-
tion of Canadian reprints into Britain.
Therefore, as speedily as it could be done—in a little
moie than four months, not to keep a British possession
waiting in the exercise of its constitutional legislative
minority a British Act of Parliament was passed to
aieet the case. 1
Resuming*:
11. In 1875 a Canadian Act (38 Vic., c. 88) met
die necessity for cheap Canadian reprints of
British copyright works, and enlarged the eopy-
'lght field to meet international pressure. Copy-
right was given (sec. 4) to “ any person domiciled
n Canada or in any part of the British posses-
ions, or being a citizen of any country having a l
international copyright treaty with the Unitec
vingdom ; provided that the subject of copy
11- i P r ) n^e< i and published or reprinted anc
epu Wished in Canada, or in the case of works o
rt that it be produced or reproduced in Canada,
vithin ‘ one month from the date of the origina
inblication elsewhere.”
Interim copyright could be obtained during th
ebatable month by registration with the Ministe
a charge of copyright (sec. 10). Canadian reprin
nd importation of foreign reprints was prohibitec
ar that month (sec. 11). Failure to reprint anc
epubhsh in Canada during the month, after
souring interim copyright, was punishable by
ne of $lOO (sec. 17). Sec. 15 gave copyright to
miadian reprints of British copyright books non
Dpvnghteu in Canada (with power under the
jbsequent Imperial Act to exclude foreign re-
mits) ; but British-printed copies of those books
ere still to be admitted to Canada. Sec. 22 pro-
ided that if a work copyrighted in Canada
Dcaine out of print, any person might complain
) the Minister, who was to notify the copyright
wner; and if the owner did not apply a remedy
'thin a reasonable time, the Minister might
Dense any person to reprint or import on payment
royalty. * J
12. In 1875 the Imperial Parliament passed a
'pendent Act (38 & 39 Vic., c. 63) providing
i Canadian reprints of British copy-
pit books should not be imported into the
mted Kingdom; and (sec. 5) that (seeing
madian reprints could now be copyrighted, and
reign reprints of the same works were excluded),
reign reprints of books not copyrighted in
mada could still enter under the 1868 Order in
luncil.
L 3. In 1886, the Canadian Act of 1875 became
apter 62 of the Revised Statutes. Chapter 33 of
3 Revised Statutes was the Customs Act, which
I in effect states existing duties as follows:
a. On books, excepting foreign reprints
British copyright works and Bibles, etc., 15
cent, ad valorem.
b. On foreign reprints of British copyrig
works, 27J per cent, ad valorem.
o. Free imports are bound books which hav
been printed longer than seven years, exce]
foreign reprints of British copyright works.
d. Prohibited imports are reprints of wori
copyrighted in Canada.
Recent Canadian Legislation,
14. In 1889 a Canadian Act (52 Vic., c. 2
varied (sec. 1) the definition of persons entitled tc
copyright to include “Any person domiciled i
Canada or in any part of the British possessions
or a,ny citizen of any country which has an inter
national copyright treaty with the United King
dom, in which Canada is included ” ; provide
that, simultaneously with the first publication
production thereof elsewhere, the subject of copy
right shall be registered in Canada (including
leposit of copy of title and payment of fee), an
;hat, “ within one month after publication or pro
luction elsewhere ,” “ such work shall be printed anc
published or produced in Canada, or repainted ant
•epublished and reproduced in Canada."
This Act contained a provision that it was not to come
ito force till proclamation by the Governor-General. I
ms assented to May 2, 1889 ; but apparentlv was not pro
laimed, and consequently had no effect, though it
ppears in “ Acts of the Parliament of the Dominion o
ianada,” Ottawa, 1889, pp. 133-5.
15. In 1895 a Canadian Act amended the 1889
by adding (sec. 3) that if a book copyrighted
i Canada was not printed and published in
anada so as to meet the Canadian demand, a
cense to print might issue.
With this addition, the section thus reproduced the
commendation of the British Copyright Commission of
78. (Report, clause 207).
jc. 5 provided for the revocation of the license if
te owner of copyright undertook to supply the
xnadian demand for the book.
The Act was assented-to 22 July, 1895 ; but apparently
so far as it depended on the unproclaimed Act of 1889 ’
had no effect.
16. In 1900 a Canadian Act revised the licensing
stem. Sec. 1 provided that if a book in which Cana-
an copyright subsisted, had been first published
any part of the British Dominions other than
mada; and if the owner of the Canadian copy-
ist and of the copyright acquired by such publi-
hon licensed Canadian reprint; then the Minis-
• might prohibit importation of foreign reprints
cept with the consent of the licensee.
'his is existing Canadian law.
In Conclusion.
After a first glance at the Commonwealth Bi
recognising the honest pains that Senator Keatin
had applied to its construction and the features
which it improved upon the present state o
things, the Bui was here praised highly— t
highly. Now that there nas been time
study its provisions, that praise must be
great measure withdrawn. It is now suggestec
that Senator Keating has approached the sui
ject at the wrong end, and traversed it i
the wrong way. Instead of coming to :
as an Australian citizen, jealous for the righ
and dignity of Australia, and putting th
interest of Australia above any other inte
est whatsoever, he has come to it rather as
citizen of the world—with the result that, wlfil
the Australian author is protected, the Australia
reader may be less well served than thi
Canadian reader, and the claims of Australia
industry are certainly not provided for as they art
in Canada.
Now the reader’s claim, and the claim of indus
try, are of great importance. It is important tha
literature should be provided for Australian
readers as freely and cheaply as possible. It i
important that the _ Australian industries—th
industries of the printer, binder, typefoundei
paper-maker, ink-maker, cloth-maker and th<
rest—should receive the greatest possible en
couragement consistent with the rights o
authors and readers. Since Australia needi
population for trade and defence, ever 1
additional man engaged in any of those in
dustries becomes an additional source of nations
prosperity, an additional bulwark in nations
danger. We do not want to pay the wages o
men employed beyond Australia when we cai
with equal or greater profit to authors and reader
pay wages to Australian citizens. And it is sub-
mitted that the Canadian compromise meets the
case better than the repetition of British ideas
which has commended itself to Senator Keating.
There is no question of conflict with the Imperia
authorities. What is good for Canada is
(in the direction referred to) good for Aus
tralia. What has been Imperially authorised for
Canada can without doubt be Imperially authorised
for Australia. And even the British Commission
of 1878, upon which Senator Keating relies, re-
ported in favour of a system by which local
reprints of British copyright books might be
licensed, and in favour of the perpetuation of the
existing British law permitting the importation ol
foreign reprints if that system were not applied in
the interest of readers.
As Senator Symon said : even lawyers may know
little of copyright. There is danger that, coming
with Ministerial authority, Senator Keating’s Bill
will be passed into law too hastily, since legisla-
tors who may not understand the principles in-
volved will naturally rely upon Ministerial
authority. But there is no reason for
haste. The amendment of copyright law is a
matter of urgency, yet not of the greatest urgency.
Once enacted, we may not find the law easy of
amendment; and the question deserves the fullest
consideration before it is fundamentally settled
for the Commonwealth. It is therefore suggested
that the Bill be referred to a Commission, before
which representatives of the trades and profes-
sions affected may have opportunity of giving
evidence. It is urged strongly that the Bill
should not be permitted to pass the Parliament
with its present principles maintained.

LIKE HISTORY IT REPEATS ITSELF
As a means of pleasure and sport, the Winchester Automatic
Rifle is as far ahead of any other .22 Caliber as an automobile
is ahead of the historic one-horse shay. After loading this
rifle, all that it is necessary to do to shoot it ten times is to
pull the trigger for each shot. Although automatic in action,
it is simple in construction and not apt to get out of order.
For city, country or camp it is the gun of the day.

A TORPID LIVER.
A CATALOGUE OF SYMPTOMS.
The Case of Mrs. M. WINC.
(By a Sydney Reporter.)
Events which havo eyidently left an
impression upon the mind never to be
obi iterated—events which at one time
were beheld with grief and dismay—
are here related by Mrs. Maria Wing,
of Dora-street, Hurstville, upon whom
a pressman recently called, and was
courteously accorded an interview.
“It is twelve years ago now," ex-
plained Mrs. Wing, “since I took Cle-
ments Tonic for indigestion and neu-
ralgia, but if it were twice that time I
should never forget how much I owe
to that remedy for its powerful cura-
tive influence."
“Had your afflictions been in exis-
tence long ?"
“muite seven years, so you can ga-
ther from that what a wreck I was.
Even from childhood I had been a
great sufferer from nervousness, and
each year found that complaint more
fully developed then ever. When neu-
ralgia started, the pains in my jaws,
all about my head, behind my eyes,
and at the back of my neck and right
down my shoulders wore unendurable.
Night after night passed by and not
an Hour's sleep, with the result that,
by-and-bve, 1 felt almost dazed for the
want of rest. This, however, was not
the full extent of my adversities, for I
daresay you know what indigestion is
like ? It meant that whenever I took
any food—and I did not have much at
a time, my appetite being so poor—l
got a feeling m the chest like a tight-
ness, as if I had overeaten, and a
nasty, full, uncomfortable feeling also
affected me in the stomach. But tho
bilious attacks I had wore horrible.
Some days, from the time I got up in
the morning till the sun went down in
the evening, 1 could do nothing but
retch, and on those particular occa-
sions I had such a fearful sensation in
my head that I could not hold it up.
Talk about being depressed—why, that
was no namo for it ; I was absolutely
melancholy, and what also helped me
to be so was a continual presentiment
that something was going to happen.
Try how l would I could not get out
of my head the idea that some kind of
trouble was awaiting me, and if it
didn't come to-day I was sure it would
arrive to-morrow. Oh ! it was a life
that one should bo pitied for leading,
and I'm sure I’ll do all I can to help
other poor women out of similar pre-
dicaments. Now I know that an infal-
lible cure is within the reach of every-
body, I consider it but right that I
should make known to the world what
that cure is, and for this reason alone
I am actuated in going into full de-
tails. Yes, when those bilious attacks
were on I was so upset generally that
I could not oven take a drink of water.
Nothing whatever would stay on the
stomach, so it’s nothing to marvel at
that I got as thin as a shadow and as
weak as a kitten. And the giddiness
that I had to contend with. It used to
come on suddenly, and almost cause
me to fall sometimes, and it was
strange how my eyes felt so swollen
and the sight bad besides.”
“Those are symptoms arising from
the disordered state of the liver," re-
marked the writer.
“Exactly, and further evidence in
support of that lay in the fact that
my mouth had a bitter taste, and 1
had a white coating over my tongue;
and not until I had taken some Cle-
ments Tonic could I get rid of those
symptoms cither.”
“What medicine had you taken pre-
viously ?"
“Nearly every kind of pills and me-
dicines ever heard of, and there was
not one of them that was worth my
while to refer to. Such useless trash 1
'“dn’t think possible could exist, and
it just shows you how advisable it is
to relate such experiences as mine so
that people’s money should not be
thrown away. Doctors, too, they used
to attend me and prescribe medicine,
but it never came to anything. I felt
no better after taking it, and that is
why, to tell you the truth, I started
to lose hope, and think that. 1 was
never going to get rid of my com-
plaints again. One thing that caused
me no small amount of alarm was pal-
pitation of the heart, which used to
be particularly troublesome when lying
down at night, but Clements Tonic
soon set my mind at rest by making
the heart’s pulsation regular and
steady, and at the same time I ob-
served a great falling off in the bother
1 previously had. with flatulence. My
chest became eased of its burdensome
feelings, and when I had been using
Clements Tonic a little while the dis-
comforts to the stomach after meals
was entirely absent. So far so good, I
thought ; hut there was a lot for Cle-
ments Tonic to do still, if it w'as only
equal to the occasion.”
‘‘And was it equal to all your re-
quirements V”
“Yes; every one of them, and what
a lucky woman I was to be suro ! Just
fancy being almost mad with pain like
1 frequently used to be, to fruitlessly
spend money in all directions trying to
get relief, to becomo hopeless and de-
spondent, and then, at last, to get a
medicine hituerto overlooked which
was the very one that could cure me !
Don’t you think T had cause to be
deeply grateful ? Ah, well ! I sincerely
trust that my experience may reach
the ears of others, who will soon
know that 1 have spoken nothing but
iho truth about Clements Tonic. With-
out exaggeration, that remedy set me
entirely free from all the pains I have
mentioned, gave me such an appetite
that I could eat anything that was
going, and so invigorated my nervous
system that I could stand any kind of
noire without trembling, and as for
having ugly dreams or spending my
time in worrying over imaginary trou-
bles aheau, why, 1 never thought of
such things after being on Clements
Tonic a few weeks. And if anything
will make a person sleep soundly it is
Clements Tonic, for by using it it be-
came a regular tiling for me to fall off
shortly after getting into bed, and
not till ne’arlv breakfast time would I
wake again. It was a delightful change,
and it will give you an idea of the
perfect cure it was when I tell you
that I am now heavier than I have
ever been before.”
“Well, that ought to be a good in-
dex as to your health.”
“And so it is, for I can now work
well and enjoy the _ privilege of living,
whereas before taking Clements Tonic
life was only a drudgery that was not
worth enduring. I have advised dozens
of people to take Clements Tonic, and
shall always do so. You also have my
permission to publish this interview in
any way you like for the benefit of the
general community.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As Good as New.
Oh, this is a song of the old lights, that came to
my heart like a hymn;
And this is a song for the old lights—the lights
that we thought grew dim,
That came to my heart to comfort me, and I pass
it along to you ;
And here is a hand to the good old friend who
turns up as good as new.
And this is a song for the camp-fire out west
where the stars shine bright.
Oh, this is a song for the camp-fire where the old
mates yarn to-night;
Where the old mates yarn of the old days, and
their numbers are none too few.
And this is a song for the good old times that will
turn up as good as new.
Oh, this is a song for the old foe—we have both
grown wiser now.
And this is a song for the old foe, and we’re sorry
we had that row.
And this is a song for the old love —the love that
we thought untrue—
Oh, this is a song of the dear old love that comes
back as good as new.
Oh, this is a song for the black sheep, for the
black sheep that fled from town,
And this is a song for the brave heart, for the
brave heart that lived it down.
And this is a song for the battler, for the battler
who sees it through—
And this is a song for the broken heart that turns
up as good as new.
Ah, this is a song for the brave mate, be he bush-
man, Scot, or Russ,
A song for the mates we will stick to —for the
mates who have stuck to us;
And this is a song for the old creed, to do as a
man should do,
Till the Lord takes us all to a wider world where
we’ll turn up as good as new.

The Sea is a Sultana
Imperious and fair;
A Queen of the Zenana
With heaving bosom bare.
The Sun, her Lord and Lover,
From his imperial height,
His golden throne above her,
Sends kisses of keen light.
What high dream is she dreaming,
The fair Sultana sea ?
So bright she is in seeming;
Can she know tragedy ?
She is the Queen of Magic,
Of changing smiles and sighs;
Yet in her heart-deeps tragic
The lost Atlantis lies.

Kincardine.
You said, when our flocks were driven
To death in the Drought King’s reign :
“ Oh, for the mist on Loch Leven,
And the grey North Sea again ! ”
When we lay heartsick and weary
At the close of a burning day,
You said : “ It were well, my dearie,
Could we couch on a Scottish brae.”
The far land of Scotland ;
The grey land of Scotland;
Where the hearts are guid and fine
In the homes of Kincardine.”
When our wattle wore its yellow,
Crowning all the sandy hills ;
And each bush bird called its fellow
In a thousand mocking trills ;
You said : “ Would we were together
Where the tall stocks bloom and blow,
For ’tis in the land o’ heather
That the sweetest blossoms grow.
The far land of Scotland ;
The brown land of Scotland;
There are roses fair and fine
Blooming red in Kincardine.”
When the floods were on the plain land,
And the creeks were running free;
When the stockyard was the mainland,
And the paddock was the sea ;
When the yellow torrents curled
Round each rocking myall tree—
You said : “ Half across the world
Lie the waters of the Dee
In the fair land of Scotland ;
The great land of Scotland;
It is good in rain or shine
By the Dee in Kincardine.”
Ah 1 the cold North Sea is calling
Over Queensland's yellow plain ;
Snowflakes on its grey waves falling,
Or the icy sleet and rain.
You would give our golden weather
And our wide unpeopled miles,
For a yard or two of heather
In your distant Scottish isles.
The far land of Scotland ;
The grey land of Scotland ;
Does your heart grow cold to mine
Dreaming still of Kincardine ?

THE BAD BOY.
State Premier Carruthers nowadays lives ill a political sense by finding imaginary grievances against the Australian Parliament, by
speaking severely about imaginary injuries done by it to N.S.W., and by posing as a valiant individual who is saving his State from imaginary,
destruction. In fact, he diverts attention from his own mismanagement by being the soured small boy who sticks out his tongue a
Australia’s Parliament.

SHALL WE BUY POPULATION FROM
BOOTH.
The Bulletin is forced reluctantly to the con-
clusion that Australia should answer with a firm
“No ” Salvation Army leader Booth’s proposal
to dump 5000 agricultural families in the Common-
wealth. It is true that this continent wants
population. It is, also, probably true that the
addition of 5000 families, of average ability and
means to seek out livelihoods for themselves,
would not cause any pro rata increase in the un-
employed, even were no special means adopted
to find them posts in advance. The economic
condition of the country, in spite of the burdens
of debt, partial Freetrade and land mono-
poly, is sufficiently sound to allow that to be
said. It is also most certainly true that, with
effective legislation, discouragement of the im-
porter and the land monopolist, Australia could
absorb 5000 or 500,000, or indeed 5,000,000 families
within a very few years. But, granting all that,
the question to be settled now hinges on things as
they are. not on tilings as they might and ought
to be. The fact has to be kept in mind that, such
is the importance of attracting immigrant popula-
tion, very grave care must be taken against enter-
ing upon a scheme that is likely to fail. Australia
now attracts hardly any immigrants, partly
as the effect of the villainously bad govern-
ment of the Tories in the past; partly because of the
Stinking Fish cry which those Tories raise when
an effort is made to clean up the mess that they
left behind them; and mainly because of* the
neglect of the people to offer a certainty of employ-
ment by developing such “great natural resources”
as the conversion of coal and iron dirt into steel
and sheep covering into cloth. If, in addition to
these handicaps, Australia is going to gibbet on
its coast the wreck of a big scheme, such as Booth
proposes, the effect will be bad. In short Aus-
tralia canr.nv afford to run any serious risk of
failure, and the Booth scheme seems to promise
failure with the assertiveness of the big drum at an
Army meeting.
* • * *
In the first place it has to be admitted that
the agricultural immigrant is, at present, the
immigrant with the poorest chance. There is
a generous area of good land in Australia. In
IN.S.W. alone there is as much usable agricul-
tural land as in France. But very little of it is
available. Some of it Mr. Willis has. Much of
it has been locked up for the benefit of those
gentlemen who were cute enough to recognise
that with Mr. Willis as agent all things were
possible in the Lands Department. Yet more
of it was given away in the early days of
the State for services ranging from convict-
flogging and debauchery to more worthy work,
and is now held from full production by
the grip of dead hands. Yet more is in the
maw of absentee monopoly co. ’s. Not to go into
details, the practical situation is this, that there
are many N.S.W. citizens, who know the country
and its agricultural conditions, and who cannot
get good land on reasonable terms. The same
statement is true of Victoria, S.A., and Tasmania.
Whilst that is so, it is absurd to import an immi-
grant on the representation that he is to be given
a “good chance ” on the land. If there are those
good chances available, why are they not offered
to our own sons ? They have the right to first
consideration. It is probably true that of 5000
men coming here with a fair stock of money
and knowledge, the majority could carve
out a competency for themselves. But there
is no reasonable prospect of success on the land
for 5000 struggling heads of families. If there is,
why is not that prospect held out to our own
citizens, of whom 5000 could readily be found
anxious to have a “ chance on the land ” ?
. When Australia has openings for agricultural
immigrants (that will be as soon as tariff reform
and land reform open the farm and the factory to
labor) it would be still doubtful whether it would
be wise to encourage any “ colonies ’’ of settlers
divided by race, tongue, religion, or social habits
from the bulk of the community. Australia
wants absorbable citizens, immigrants who,
within a reasonable time, will become Aus-
tralians, and whose children’s children will be
indistinguishable from our descendants. A colony
of Germans, or Scandinavians, or Russians,
imported as a colon}’, and settled under such con-
ditions as to emphasise its segregation from the
rest of the community and to preserve its differing
characteristics, would be objectionable, though any
number of individual Germans, Scandinavians, or
Russians might be welcome. To almost the same
extent, a colony, if such were proposed, of Roman
Catholics, or Presbyterians, or High Anglicans, or
any of those curious out-sizes in religions with
which Canada has had such strange experiences,
would invite opposition, if it were proposed as a
condition of the settlement that the colonists
should be disciplined to retain customs and ideas
separating them from the rest of the community.
When the question is narrowed down to a direct
“aye” or “ nay ” to a proposal from “General”
Booth to send 5000 families, organised by himself,
the special objections which obtrude are so many
that a refusal would be justified, even if this were
our only hope of receiving immigrants.
* * * *
“ General ” Booth, it may be premised, is not
in this business for his health. His nose guaran-
tees that. If Mr. Booth takes the trouble to get
together 5000 families to send to Australia, there
is going to be something in it for Mr. Booth. He
took the trouble, years ago, to send a big drum and
a tambourine, and a vociferous saltatory “captain,”
and a strenuous “lass” to Australia, and since
then the continent has paid heavy tribute to
Booth. The big drum bangs in every town to
bring the eleemosynary penny to the tambourine,
and the aggregate penny, after a finely-cut allow-
ance for costs of collection, goes to Booth. In
almost every town the Army has halls ; in
almost every city it has industries. They all
belong to Booth. His rescue homes and doss
houses sell a cheap line in salvation and bunks and
soup on strictly cash terms and commercial prin-
ciples. His industries for the unemployed mostly
represent competition in a refuge by a man or
woman, who is fed on broken victuals and nasal
psalms, against an individual outside who is trying
to make decent food for a family at a similar
calling, and these refuges cause as much un-
emjjloyment as they relieve. It is a matter of
some certainty that if Australia grants land to a
Booth colony, the paw of Booth will in some way
be on the land. Possibly he may not ask that the
deeds shall be locked up in his London office, but
he certainly will keep some sort of control over
the settlers and the settlement, and will be to
some extent its absentee landlord, as he is to-day
the great absentee cadger and sweater of Aus-
tralia.
* * ■* *
Even if the extraordinary happened and it was
found, when “General” Booth came to his terms,
that he proposed to make no profit for his Army
out of his Australian settlement; that he was going
to be paid for his trouble merely by the gratitude
of the British rich for being relieved of so many
British poor, there would still be the best of
reasons for looking askance at his Salv’army settle-
ment. The men would be, without a doubt, about
the worst type to face the problem of wresting a
living from the Australian land, which requires,
above all things, steady pluck. They would be men
who have been down—right down—and whose
misfortunes have taken the heart out of them.
Such colonists would be servile as men and
tyrannical as masters. The man who has
been “submerged” to such an extent as to
have to cling to a Salv’army plank to get back to
the surface—to have to drop his self-respect and
his sense of the ridiculous by joining in the
grotesque antics of that cult—is emphatically not
the man who can face the Australian busli, which
is. on the whole, kind to the brave but very cru-el
to the broken man.
For these and other reasons The Bulletin
would urge the Australian Government to dis-
courage the Booth proposal. We want immi-
grants certainly ; but still more we want occupa-
tion for immigrants. And when the occupation is
offering, the new colonists can be far better
chosen by an Australian High Commissioner than
by the head of a fantastic religious organisation
whose main associations with Australia are of
begging and sweating. There is no reason to get
hysterical over the immigration question. A
strong policy is called for, but not a policy of
getting population of any sort at any price. If
Prime Minister Deakin can decide on—
(1) The appointment of a High Commissioner to com-
bat the lies of the Stinking F.sh party, and so encourage
a stream of immigrants with capital.
(2) A higher tariff to establish new industries with a
consequent new demand for artisan and agricultural
population.
(3) A Federal progressive land-tax to break up land
monopoly.
(4) A system of assisting desirable immigrants after
work and land have been made available for them.
we will attract enough, immigration to more than
double the population within a decade. And that
population will have to pay no tribute to a foreign
religious potentate ; it will have no bonds to keep
it from mingling with the rest of the population ;
and it will not necessarily bring any more savage
noise and big drum, to a land which has already
much big drum and concertina and singing of
“1 he Y\ r ild Colonial Boy. ’
TASMANIA—AN AWFUL EXAMPLE.
A week or two ago Tasmania evolved a financial
statement, and in the course thereof the Treasurer
issued—it would seem unconsciously—about the
most damning indictment of the great loan policy
that has yet been published. Also, he said some
terrible things—apparently without the least idea
that he was saying them —about the fine old
fiction that this country borrows money for “ per-
manent and reproductive works,” and thereby
gloriously develops its “magnificent natural re-
sources.” The “permanent and reproductive"*
idea and the “ great natural ” idea are two of the
solid stand-bys of these States. They are the
two sagging legs on w'hich the loan monstrosity
lives and moves and has its being. It is held in a
general way that the loan business pays, that it
isn’t a burden on the people but rather enriches
them by “developing” the “resources,” &c., and
that, though the interest is high, the profits, in
some obscure fashion, are higher. Tasmania,
being an unusually retrograde place, holds to this
theory very firmly indeed, and when the Treasurer
issued the following table showing the growth of
taxation per inhabitant as debt accumulated he
probably had no intention of throwing clods at
the Ark of the Covenant:—
Tasmanian Taxation.
Customs Direct
and Excise. Taxation. Total.
1865 ..£152 £O7l £1 12 6
1880 .. 1 18 4 0 15 9 2 14 1
1890 .. 2 7 11 0 18 4 3 6 3

1903 .. 214 0 16 11 2 18 3
1904 .. 1 17 0 143 313
That is the thing which Treasurer Stewart fired
off without the least knowledge that it was loaded.
* * » »
These figures (and very similar figures could be
produced for every other State) show various
things—all of them unpleasant. The first is that
the loan policy commenced, not on any high prin-
ciple of developing the country, nor as part of any
far-sighted system, but simply that the lazy,
cowardly, shiftless ancestors might have a good
time, and hang the consequences. Tasmania in
1865 had no debt, and the tired pioneers of the land
paid only 325. 6d. per head annually in taxation.
They wanted money for railways, roads, harbors,
and other works, and they borrowed it because
they preferred selling their country, and their
children, into financial slavery to paying more
than 325. 6d. per annum in taxes. The fact that
their policy would leave their sons in 1900 to pay
725. each per annum in taxes troubled them not at
all. In a general way, they damned their sons,
and decided that their daughters might shift tor
themselves. They borrowed money for roads,
bridges, railways, harbor works, wharves, tele-
graphs, fortifications, rifles, cartridges, schools,
gaols, asylums, and sundries—they borrowed to
cover grants in aid of religion, they borrowed
to cover revenue, shortages, and they borrowed
generally. And every time they borrowed some
more for “permanent and reproductive works”
and further “developed the great natural re-
sources” of the State, taxation went up, because
the works were temporary and unproductive, and
the borrowing of £1 to develop 2s. 6d. worth of
resources is a thing that doesn’t pay.
* * * *
Tasmania, like almost every other State here-
abouts, has paid in interest and expenses as much, or
just about as much, as it borrowed, and still owes
the debt. It has borrowed about 9Jj millions. It
has paid something not far short of millions.
It still owes millions. By-and-bye, if the
present system continues, it will have paid
19 millions and still owe 9| millions. Later it
will have paid 38 millions and still owe the
original 9| millions. But if the selfish old dod-
derers who ran things in ’65, and the other selfish
old dodderers who came after them, had paid as
much in taxation as their descendants have to pay
now, there never need have been any debt. If the
taxes in ’65 had been put up to the level of 1900
there would have been £200,000 a year available
for public works, and this sum would have steadily
increased as the population increased, and it
would have further increased because the revenue
from such of the new works as yielded revenue,
instead of going to pay interest, would have been
available to build more works with. Then, as the
income from works expanded, taxation could have
been reduced. If Tasmania had taxed its people
at the rate of, say, 61s. 3d. each in 1865, and
tapered down to 325, 6d. in 1900 or 1904, instead
of beginning at 325. 6d. in 1865 and broadening up
to 725. in 1900 and 61s. 3d. in 1904, the island could
have had all the public works it has now;
it would have owed not one penny instead
of owing £9,500,000 ; and it would have saved
all the millions it has paid in interest.
And on the whole it would have paid no more
taxes without the debt thawit has done with the
debt. But the heavy end of the taxation would
have been at the 1865 end of the period instead of
at the 1900 or 1904 end, and the selfish old shirkers
of 1865 preferred selling their country into slavery
to carrying the weighty end of the burden. The
only satisfaction is that some of them are still
alive to reap the crop of misery they sowed.
* * * *
Tasmania has lately paid a little less taxa-
tion than it did in 1900; that is not because
its position has improved, but simply because
the island has entered on another career of
aggravated shirking. In 1900 it was paying
something off its floating deficit; in 1902-3-4 it
was letting things slide and adding largely to
the deficit. It resolved to let things slide partly
that it could reduce the taxes on PROPERTY ; in
1897 Bs. 4d. per head of the total taxation was
levied on property ; in 1902 only 4s. 9d. per head
of the taxation and in 1904 6s. per head repre-
sented taxes on property. The amount of taxa-
tion levied on property is about £14,000 less
than it was seven years ago. But while property
thus crawled out from underneath its burdens the
situation of the State was incredibly bad. In
1904, the last year for which complete figures are
available, the amount of interest which had to be
made good out of taxation was £249,499. That
was the dead horse, the interest on unproductive
debt, the burden of the lie which the cowardly
shirking fathers of the State told when they
declared that the loans were invested in per-
manent and reproductive works. This amount
represented £1 7s. Bd. per inhabitant for the year,
and when it is compared with the figures of the
leading countries of the world it shows this
amazing result

Almost every one of the European debts in the
above list is largely represented by public works,
and on an average the income from public works
covers half the interest bill. In some countries
the revenue from public works covers all the
interest bill. But if the European nations owned
no public works at all, and every penny of their
interest had to be paid out of taxation, the position
of the worst of them, with all its war debts and
all its naval and military expenditure, wouldn’t
be so awful as that of Tasmania, which never had
a war, which never supported a single war-ship,
which never maintained enough armed men to
make a single efficient regiment, and which has
done all this ruin inside 40 years. Yet Tasmanian
papers and politicians still talk of their debt being
represented by permanent and reproductive
works, and say that it isn’t like the “ war debts ”
of Europe.

Tasmania nowadays is full of patronising Tories
—Women’s Leaguers, Dobsons, and the like—
who speak at great length about how the Austra-
lian Government allegedly “ discourages immigra-
tion.” Also, the fact that departures from Tas-
mania at present exceed arrivals is haughtily set
down to the machinations of the Labor party.
Considering what a genius Tasmania has dis-
played for driving away population by Tory
misgovernment, this attitude is a sample of stu-
pendous ignorance —or stupendous effrontery.
Tasmanian published immigration statistics com-
mence only in 1847, and since then the years in
which departures largely exceeded arrivals were
these:—
1850, 1851, 1852, 1854, 1856, 1858,
1861, 1862, 1863, 1867, 1869,
1871, 1872, 1873, 1874, 1875,
1885, 1886, 18S8,
1892, 1893, 1894, 1895,
1900, 1901, 1902, 1903, 1904.
Even as far back as the sixties the result for a
whole decade (1862-1871) were a loss of 4604 per-
sons by continued excess of departures, and in the
10 years 1892-1901 the loss was 5091. That was
before Immigration Restriction laws were heard
of, and before any Labor party began to trouble
the dead island. Even the ghastly fact that the
population of misgoverned Tasmania actually
decreased during the first six months of 1905 isn’t
quite new in the island’s experience. It had
similar decreases in 1827, 1837, 1839, 1852, 1854,
1869, and in 1875, and it had many years when it
showed an increase of only a few dozen or a few
hundred people. These matters can’t be set down
to the Labor party, though in the very early days
the hard-labor party may have been partly
responsible.
♦ * * *
Tasmania with its decreasing population (it is
the only State of the Commonwealth which is
acquainted with that disgrace), with its decreasing
area under crop, with its huge estates which
it won’t break up to provide land for the people,
because “the rights of property must be re-
spected,” with the greatest burden of unproductive
debt on earth (save that of Queensland alone),
with its renewed deficits caused solely by
reduction of taxes, with its unspeakably sel-
fish, ignorant, bigoted, incompetent and pre-
tentious Upper House, with its Freetrade tradi-
tions (for though the island used to have a heavy
tariff it never had much of a Protective tariff), is
the disgrace and despair of the Commonwealth.
It hasn’t one politician who has the courage to
face the situation ; not one who even seems to
know that there is a situation to be faced. It is
the most fertile and best-watered of the States,
and it is overcrowded with a population of less
than seven persons to the square mile. It has
been a very constant failure for over 40 years, and
now while it is crumbling into decay its Parlia-
ment is engaged on a Bill for the protection of
homing pigeons. And it is full of old political
dullards, who bleat about “ Federal extrava-
gance ” because the Australian Government
doesn’t borrow, but charges its public works to
ordinary expenditure—which naturally swells the
expenditure somewhat. The only visible hope for
Tasmania lies in a new Federal tariff which will
supply really High Protection; in a Federal
graduated land-tax of such a weighty nature that
it will break up the Y.D.L. Co.’s estate in one
act, and many other estates likewise, and make
land so far available that seven persons to the
square mile won’t overcrow’d this well-watered
island ; and in the assumption of the Tasmanian
debt (along with the other State debts) by the
Commonwealth, the only authority which has the
courage or the honesty to try to pay off a debt.
Then, when its State politicians are reduced to
about the status of aldermen, and the ancient sea-
captain who is now Premier becomes a sort of
mayor, some remarkable individuals will find
their proper level for the first time.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Carruthers as a Bogus Federal Authority.
The latest attitude of Joseph Carruthers of
N.S.W., in his constant attempt to usurp the
Federal authority, is such a vast and bounding
insolence that it ought to cause both Houses of
the Australian Parliament to revolt and tread the
State Rights push flat. Joseph has lately ex-
plained his position in the State Assembly thus :
He recently asked the Prime Minister of the Common-
wealth to be furnished with at least 10 copies of all Bills
presented to the Federal Parliament, as introduced, to
enable him to obtain reports from the officers best quali-
fied to express an opinion on any particular measure, and,
if thought necessarv, to make representations to the
Federal Government in the matter. As soon as he per-
ceived that the Commerce Bill seemed in some respects
to be an attempt to pass Federal legislation on matters
which it was decided at the Hobart Conference should be
left to State control, he communicated with the Premiers
of the other States with a view to a joint protest being
made to the Federal Government. Similar action would
be taken whenever a measure was introduced which it
was considered embodied provisions detrimental to the
interests of the States, and members might rest assured
that every legitimate step would be taken to safeguard
the rights of the States. The views of the New South
Wales Government in regard to the Bills relating to the
representation of the several States in the House of
Representatives, and to census and statistics of the Com-
monwealth, had already been conveyed to the Prime
Minister.
The Hobart Conference, to which Carruthers
refers as representing a momentous occasion at
which Federal and State rights were carefully
defined, was a gathering whereat George Reid,
being then half-Premier, professed to usurp the
power of the House of Representatives, and of the
Senate, and of his colleagues, and of all future


Prime Ministers and their colleagues, and also to
alter and limit the Constitution, by promising that
the Australian Parliament would not deal with
certain matters which the Constitution entrusts
to its charge. George Reid’s agreement at the
Hobart Conference is not, and never was, worth
a burnt match, and Carruthers’ attempt to collect
payment from the Commonwealth of Reids
political bad debts is a virulent sample of blurt.
As regards the other points, the guardians or
State Rights are not the State Premiers but each
State’s six senators, and when Joe Carruthers
and Jack Evans and such-like persons profess to
be senators and to take over the duties of senators
it is time for the Senate to inform the Prime
Minister most distinctly that this bumptious act
of usurpation will not be tolerated. In pursuance
of a steady policy for the repression of fussy and
impertinent underlings, CARRUTHERS ought to be
told to pay for his own copies of Federal Buis.
He should be informed that his views on the rep-
resentation of the States and on census a,nd
statistics are of no more importance, seeing
that none of these things concern him
officially, than the views of any casual boot-
black or other individual voter. In these
matters Joseph is a private voter —only that and
nothing more. And it is more than time to
impress upon Carruthers that, if the Australian
Parliament, in spite of the existence of the
Senate, goes beyond its authority, and tres-
passes on State rights, whatever these may be,
the High Court will attend to the matter; its
decisions, and not any alleged resolutions of a
dead and gone gathering of meddlers at Hobart,
are the means by which the Constitution is
interpreted. The people in this matter have a
claim on Prime Minister Deakin —a claim which
that too-affable person seems apt to forget. In
certain matters —a large number of matters they
are supposed to be governed wholly by the two
Federal Houses of Parliament, elected on a pure
adult suffrage. They are not supposed to be
governed in any of these matters by the advice
or interference of Carruthers, or Bent, or Jack
Evans, or Parson Fitchett, or George Pile, or
Wren, of the Collingwood tote, or even of W. N.
Willis. And if Prime Minister Deakin fails to
remember that he is the guardian of the people s
sacred rights in this matter, a time will come
when the fact will be mentioned to him. The
people’s Federal rights are the meat, and Car-
ruthers is the fussy, incompetent little fly
that always wants to settle thereon, and the neces-
sity for shooing him off is urgent. Of course,
Carruthers’ position is easy enough of compre-
hension. As regards the matters which are within
his jurisdiction, he has shown himself a
weakling, a shuffler, and a failure. His
finance has been a disaster ; his Local
Government measure is a mild apology
and a very weak instalment; his “Reform”
policy in general is a dead thing ; and
the papers which supported him a year ago now'
give him at best a contemptuous tolerance. He
must do something to save himself from utter
slump, and the easiest thing, for a man of hispoor
calibre—with no constructive ability, no definite
opinions, no political courage, and no political
principles—is to be cheeky to his betters, to stick
out his tongue at the Australian Parliament, and
to throw an occasional rock at the front door of
the Constitution. The only thing that keeps
Carruthers politically afloat these days is Ins
pose as the virulent bad kid who is always uncivil
to the Australian Government, and the reputation
for valor that he builds up by periodically sticking
out his tongue at the Australian Parliament.
+
S. Australia’s Tight Corner.
The wrath of the S. Australian public service is
upon the Price Government because it provides for
next to no additions to civil service salaries this
year—it even cut off the few rises that the
mournful Butler agreed to recommend. S. Aus-
tralian public officers are known to be shockingly
underpaid ; the man in Adelaide who draws £250
a year is a proud person who calls no one uncle.
On the other hand, Price in S. Australia has just
about as hard a row to hoe as Morgan in Queens-
land ; and in Queensland, where salaries are
also shockingly low, public servants have not
only had no rises for some years, but have even
had to put up with special percentage reduc-
tions. S. Australia has steadily built up a
debt of £7B Is. Id. per head (Queensland’s is
about 235. per head more than that), and to make
matters worse it has sunk an enormous amount of
it in absolutely unproductive undertakings. In
buildings and similar things which ought to have
been paid for out of revenue, it has buried over a
fourth of all it has borrowed. Moreover, while
this great unproductive debt has been built up,
the population has been almost at a standstill.
In one respect S. Australia has been far worse off
than Victoria, which has been reckoned a pretty
awful example. It is true that, whereas Victoria
has lost something like 145,000 by excess of
emigration since 1892, S. Australia has lost only
23,000; but, then, Victoria had gained 112,377 in
the previous 10 years, while S. Australia actually
lost 30,945. Yet S. Australia has taken no
account of the fact that its adult population was
slipping away to the other States and leaving the
debt behind them, and it has gone on heaping new
burdens upon those who remained. Moreover,
though absolutely Queensland’s is the Greatest
Debt on Earth, per head of population, S. Aus-
tralia’s is, under ordinary circumstances, far more
burdensome than Queensland’s. For S. Australia
is a poor agricultural country, consisting of a few
patches of moderately good soil and vast areas of
howling wilderness —none the less howling wilder-
ness because, in unusually good seasons, it sings a
siren’s song to the unfortunate settler to come and
live upon its fatness —and then the hot winds
come, and the fatness melts into dust. With no
other industries to speak of, but the agricultural
and pastoral, the S. Australian population is poor
—people of simple tastes and habits and few
wants. Though they are almost without factories
to supply their own needs, they yet pay less in
customs duties than the people of any other State,
less even than those of Tasmania. In other re-
spects, too, Price’s State can at present less afford
to drift than probably any other. Queensland
has no heavy bill falling due in the early
future ; its accusing Cohen will not have to
be met till 1915, and then he will not be
the largest of the Cohens. But S. Australia’s
troubles have begun to drop in already, and will
continue to drop in every year from now until
1920. During the next 10 years £9,033,250 will
fall due, and within another three years of that
(a fact which wasn’t mentioned in the tables
issued along with the Budget speech), a further
£14,506,645. Between now and 1920 S. Australia
will not have a single 12 months of breathing time ;
every New Year’s Day it will find a Cohen waiting
on the door-mat; and what that Cohen will do
and say depends pretty largely upon what S. Aus-
tralia has done since the previous Cohen called.
If under these circumstances the S. Australian
public servant thinks the State can afford
to pay him as much as he ought to get,
The Bulletin fears that there is a cold
time of awakening ahead. And meantime
The Bulletin doesn’t hear from Premier Price
and Treasurer Peake any very definite swearing-
off of the habit which has done much more than
anything else to get the State into this mess not
such a definite swearing-off as the circumstances
call for anyway. About all it hears is the Regis-
ter cursing the new land taxation, though that
will only add £40,000 to the revenue, and the
wagging of the tongues of the old State politicians
trying to fasten the consequences of their own
sins upon “ the Federal Government,” and disre-
garding the fact that, so far as S. Australia is con-
cerned, the Federal duties are bringing in about
£50,000 a year more than the old State duties.
«.
The Decay of Victoria and Tasmania.
An amusing feature of the present immigration
movement is the fact that Premier Bent, of Vic-
toria, raises his bull-voice in the back yard of the
proceedings, and says that he is also in the business,
and is desirous of promoting agricultural immi-
gration to his State, while Premier Evans, of
Tasmania, makes faint remarks in the distance to
the same effect. During the first half of this year
—that is to say, within the brief space of six
months— Bent failed so badly to find land for his
own people, let alone for immigrants, that 6613
more people left Victoria than went into it; and
Tasmania struck a still worse experience. It was
almost entirely an agricultural exodus—a rushing
away of young men in search of land. These
people can’t afford to buy land at £lO to £l2 per
acre, miles and miles away from a market,
and slave all their lives only to pay interest
on the mortgage. They don’t want to hire
land at impossible rents from the rich,
grasping loafers of the Upper House, and
toil all their days to keep up Rupert Clarke’s
yacht, or to enlarge the Manifolds’ already
stupendous hoard, or to bloat the V.D.L. Co. So
they leave, and when Victoria, with all its rich
Western District still almost empty, and Tas-
mania, with half the State a blank, can’t find
land for people already in the country, it is mere
folly to talk of finding soil on which to settle a
rush of immigrants. If Bent can provide land
by a remorseless breaking up of the big estates—
it can’t be found in any other way —Victoria can
gain 12,000 people a year easily without any im-
migration ; in other words, it can leave off losing
12,000 people a year, that being about the average
outflow for 14 years past. Failing this it must
drop further and further back till it becomes a
third or fourth-rate State, and of little account in
the Commonwealth or in Australasia. N.S. Wales
has passed it in population long ago. Maori -
land, which believes in breaking up the big estates,
by a compulsory process, will pass it, on present
appearances, within another 10 years. Queens-
land, which gains immigrants, while Victoria
exports population, is growing six times as fast as
Bent’s State, and will also leave it behind in time.
In the matter of population, the two supremely
landlord-ridden States of the Commonwealth,
Victoria and Tasmania, are now the two horrible
examples. This is the interesting record from
January 1 to June 30 this year :
New South Wales .. .. .. .. Increase 16,727
Westralia ~ 8,837
Queensland .. .. ~ 4,714
South Australia .. .. .. .. „ 1,596
Victoria.. .. .. .. .. .. ~ 699
Tasmania Decrease 2,216
South Australia, and still more Victoria, and
most of all Tasmania, have failed for years past to
find land for their own people, and while they can’t
do that the less they talk of immigration the
better. And apparently Victoria and Tasmania
will continue in their present condition until the
Australian Parliament bursts up their big pro-
perties with a graduated land-tax, which will take
all—and more than all—the V.D.L. Co.’s income
unless it sells, and which will take fully half the in-
comes of the Clarkes and Chirnsides and Mani-
folds unless they sell. On present appearances,
Bent of Victoria and Evans of Tasmania are not
wholly responsible for the want of a bursting-up
policy ; even if they wished for such a policy, in
each case an unpatriotic and immovable Upper
House stands in the way. But these two men can
at least lend any weight they have towards
getting the Federal graduated tax, which is the
only hope of better things ; and meanwhile they
can make themselves as little ridiculous as pos-
sible over the immigration question.
The N.S.W. Lands Scandals.
Announced that the N.S.W. Lands Commission,
after spending three months investigating the im-
provement leases got by squatters who knew
enough to employ, the right kind of land agent,
now intends to devote a little while to investigat-
ing exchanges. The exchange was the great, rival
of the improvement lease in allowing facilities for
up-to-date land-agency. The improvement lease,
got through land-agency, secured for a, long term
of years, on the easiest of conditions and
lowest of rentals, land which was not of the
worthless character for which the improvement
lease tenure was invented. The exchange repre-
sented a bargain by which the State gave up
certain land to private ownership as the price of
resuming other land, the theory being that both
parties were to be benefited. What may be pro-
phesied with confidence is that when the ex-
changes were worked by land-agency methods the
State was always “had.” There will be a good
deal of curiosity as to what sort of fees were ex-
tracted for this class of business, but the investi-
gation will, after all, not bring the inquiry nearer
to its legitimate work, which is to find out
why a few men were able to work such
wonders with the Lands Department. The cata-
logue of their achievements is already great; add-
ing to it is mostly a work of supererogation. But
the Government shows not the least inclination to
take any action which would force the inquiry
into what is now the proper channel. What is
wanted is legislative provision to indemnify
some witnesses "who were themselves concerned
in land-agency transactions, so that they may,
without fear of consequences, disclose anything of
a criminal nature —if such there is to disclose—
without hurt to themselves. This has been urged
on the Government, and the idea will doubtless
be adopted—when the need for it has vanished,
just as the Government took every other step in
this inquiry. Unable to smother up the scandals
of land-agency, it does the next worst thing by
managing to be just a little late with every step of
the inquiry.
How the State Governments Drove Out
Population.
A casual statement made last week by Prime
Minister Deakin, that one of the great hindrances
to immigration lies in the inefficient land laws of
the States, moved the State Frights party to great
anger, and roused the Sydney Telegraph to its
usual yell of fury. When it had finished boiling
with rage it issued a cold and rather superior set
of remarks as follows :
Mi. Deakin has just discovered that the real obstacles
to immigration are State laws, presumably land laws. It
is not the six hatters species of legislation, which he, as
one of a Ministry, accepted against his own will, under
pressure and threats from the Labor party. It is not the
sort of legislation which would not, while a general elec-
tion was in progress, allow a shipwrecked crew to land on
the coast. It is not the sort of legislation that gives a
groom who comes to Australia in charge of horses a ticket
of leave for six months. This kind of legislation has done
no harm to Australia, or discouraged people from emi-
grating here and settling. It is laws passed by the State
Parliaments that are responsible, says Mr. Dearin.
What he attempted to do was to divert attention from
the mischievous type of law which prescribes permits and
tickets for men, and may, at the dictation of a political
union, bail them up when they arrive, keep them on a
steamer for several days, and release them only because
the counter agitation has become too strong for a timid
and terrified Government.
In view of the fact that a good many people
believe this kind of story, and fancy, ..through,
hearing the Telegraph’s constant yelp about the
Six Hatters, that this country was a fine place for
immigrants before the Commonwealth happened,
it is worth while to get down to the facts of the
case. The Commonwealth began to exist in 1901,
and the Aliens Restriction law only came into ex-
istence some time after that. And long before
there was any Commonwealth or any Federal
immigration laws, or any Six Hatters, every State
had frequent and unpleasant intervals when its
departures exceeded its arrivals, a dismal circum-
stance that could only be set down to bad land
laws, insufficient tariffs, and generally to the
sorry incompetence of the State politicians
who now blather so loftily about certain Hatters.
By way of evidence, this is the record, taken from
Coghlan’s “Statistical Account of Australia and
Maoriland.” for 20 years before the beginning of
the Commonwealth
Years when the Various States Lost Poru ration by
Excess of Departures over Arrivals.
New South Wales : 1893, 1895, i 396, 1897, 1900.
Victoria : 1892, 1893, 1894, 1895, 1896, 1897, 1898, 1899,
1900.
Queensland : 1881, 1890, 1891,1892.
South Australia : 1882,1885,1886,1887,1888,1889,1891,
1894, 1895, 1896, 1897, 1898, 1899, 1900.
Wbstralia : 1888, 1899.
Tasmania : 1885, 1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1894, 1895, 1900.
Australia and Tasmania Combined : 1892, 1893, 1898,
1899, 1900.
The largest gain recorded in one State in one year
since 1881, by excess of arrivals over departures,
was 35,891. The largest loss recorded in one State
in one year, by excess of departures over arrivals,
was 22,134. The five States which had no gold
boom—N.S.W., Queensland, Victoria, S.A. and
Tasmania—averaged, in the 20 years before Fede-
ration, 12 years of gain by excess of arrivals
and eight years of loss by excess of departures.
But for the last ten years before Federation the
States that had no gold boom averaged only four
years each of gain by excess of arrivals over depar-
tures, against six years of loss by excess of depar-
tures over arrivals. And even if Westralia, with
its gold and loan boom, is included, there were
on the average within the last ten years more
years of loss than of gain. The State politicians
who produced this dreadful result feel it necessary
to disguise their own failure by professing wild
anger about the Six Hatters, and by pretending to
believe that Australia’s inability to attract popu-
lation is a new trouble arising out of some alleged
blind tourist at Hobart. But the failure and the dis-
grace existed long before there was any Federation,
and at that time it must have been exclusively the
failure of State politicians. And considering how
little power the Federal Government exercises
now, and how much power is left to the States,
the chances are that the failure is still mainly
owing to the incapacity of State politicians. At
present the cry is for agricultural immigrants.
The first essential for agricultural immigrants is
land, and the State Parliaments control the land
and make the land laws. Prime Minister Deakin
offers to find the agricultural immigrants if the
States will supply the land. And it transpires
th it, mainly by reason of land monopolies,
Tasmania, Victoria and S.A. have no land to
offer. Westralia offers mostly sand and dust.
N.S.W. proposes to shunt its immigrants out into
the drought and scrub region ; and Queensland
seems to be the only State which is really pre-
pared to find a bit of decent soil for the bucolic
stranger who is to be within our gates.
_♦
The Proposed Victorian Code.
From a lawyer :
As the resuit of 15 months intermittent hard graft
Crown Prosecutor Finlayson and lawyer Woinarski have
presented the Bent Ministry with a couple of draft Bills
codifying and consolidating the Victorian criminal code,
at present in a singularly chaotic state. Some of the
suggested amendments are so drastic as to scare the re-
maining hairs from the heads of Tory persons of stodgy
habit, but a lot of progressive proposals are conspicuous
by their absence.
Briefly, the two lawyers put the proposed code into two
sections : (a) crimes—offences to be dealt with by juries
onlv ; (b) summary offences—with which the common
honorary is competent to deal. They suggest the aboli-
tion of the death penalty except for murder, treason,
piracy, and arson of Edward Vi l.’s ships or dockyards;
that arrests may be made without warrant on charges in-
volving a heavier penalty than five years ; the abolition
of the legal presumption that a married woman acts
under her husband’s compulsion—she ha n’t yet got full
political rights in Victoria, but she is to stand the racket
if she does anything wrong ; the sweeping away of the old
distinctions between actual offenders and aiders, abettors
and accessories before the fact—all are to bedeemed equally
guilty ; the application to all crimes of the law as to com-
pounding ; the wiping out of the distinction between
perjury committed inside a court and that committed
outside —the maximum penalty in both cases to be 15
years instead of the present 10 and seven years respec-
tively ; the abolition of the common law offences known
as maintenance, champerty, and the buying and selling
of disputed titles ; and the provision of penalties for
neglect to procure assistance in childbirth—there being
nothing at present between concealment of birth and
manslaughter. Burglary in their code is to be called
housebreaking by night; arson, wilfully burning pro-
perty ; uttering, using ; larceny, theft; also juries may be
empowered to return a verdict of certain lesser crimes
when the charge is one of manslaughter.
After recommending the utter abolition of the foolish
old grand jury, the consolidators spring their most drastic
suggestion, viz., that in criminal trials, after the jury has
agreed to disagree for the space of three hours, a three-
fourths verdict may be taken. The discordant penalties
at present provided for various similar offences are
brought into line, and in some specified cases the discre-
tion of the judges is enlarged as to imprisonment, fine,
flogging, “ solitary,” and payment of costs. Also, the
adoption of the objectionable English tioket-of-leave
system is recommended. The Bent Cabinet being under-
stood to be at present considering the question of the
indeterminate sentence no mention is made thereof; but
that very omission itself discounts a lot of the codifiers’
work. The amendments constitute a considerable ad-
vance on the present mass of anomalies miscalled a code,
but the omissions are a good deal more obvious and im-
portant than the improvements.
There is nothing about empowering juries to assess the
penalties, or to return a verdict of murder in the Ist, 2nd,
or 3rd degree ; the antiquated, degrading and useless
punishments of solitary confinement and the lash are to
be continued; there is little curtailment and much
extension of the powers of the ignorant and venal
honorary magistrate—it is even proposed to let him deal
with such offences as “ unlawfully using cattle,” etc. ;
there is no suggestion of any provision for the defence of
persons accused of any crime involving less than the
death penalty (British fairplay seems to have been
thrown overboard here); there is no suggestion that the
penalty in a case of perjury by a prosecuting witness
should be heavier than in the case of an accused (the one
is trying to save himself only, the other is endeavoring t)
injure an innocent person). In fact, considering the
known characters and characteristics of the two lawyers
who drew up the codifying- Bills, they are a distinct
disappointment; and, if accepted, they may destroy any
hope of further advance in the direction of an en-
lightened, scientific code for a good many years.

A Defence Distinction.
A big step forward will have been taken in the
organisation of a National Defence scheme when
the public is educated into recognising the differ-
ence between “conscription” and “universal
service.” Conscription picks out certain citizens
and converts them into soldiers. Universal sei«
vice makes all male citizens soldiers, but leaves
them citizens. Under the one system militarism
forms a caste separate from the mass of
the people—a caste which must be either
- tyrannical or inefficient. Under the other there
is a general diffusion of the military spirit among
the people, and since every citizen is a
soldier, and every soldier a citizen, there can
be no tyranny, and the standard of efficiency will
reflect the general standard of the nation’s skill
and public spirit. Conscription takes a percentage
of the citizens away to cloister them for years in
barracks, where they may lose the home spirit and
the home virtues. Universal service breaks none
of the citizen’s home ties ; his absences from home
are too short to rupture any family relations or to
inculcate a barracks spirit. Conscription taxes the
industrial life of a nation by calling from their
work a big proportion of the young men at
the formative period of their lives, to keep
them at drill, much of which is supererogatory.
Universal service does little more than insist
that male citizens shall give up a proportion of
their holidays to the healthful and patriotic pur-
pose of training themselves for defence ; its indus-
trial effect would, therefore, be salutary rather
than otherwise, and add to, rather than detract
from, the national wealth. Conscription may turn
out a better-drilled soldier ; universal service will
make a better-trained citizen, and, except in the
highly technical branches of warfare, a man good
enough to defend his country. Conscription is
perhaps the best policy for a nation with Imperial
ambitions, anxious to train up an army of veterans ;
universal service is the defence method for a
nation which wants to go about its business
peaceably, with no warsof conquest and annexation,
but a reliable gun handy if any enemy attempts
aggression.
The Drunk and the Moderately Drunk.
In N.S.W. statistical publications nowadays
(Statistician Cogiilan being in England) the
State’s borrowing disease is treated with a good
deal less disrespect than it deserves. The
Mon i'll i, y Statistical Bulletin for August
shows total loan expenditure for 1904-5 as
£1,510,489; a month previously the Auditor-
General had certified that it was £1,570,669. But
that discrepancy is a comparatively small matter.
There is a greater one in regard to the description
of the works in which Cohen’s money has been
sunk. The Statistician’s publication drafts the
expenditure under two main heads—“ Repro-
ductive Works” and “Other Works and
Services.” The year’s total for the reproductive
works is represented at £1,210,613; for the other
sort, £299,876. The Auditor-General, in his dis-
section, calls the undertakings reproductive, par-
tially reproductive, and unproductive ; the latter
two total, on his figuring, £366,316. The repro-
ductive works, according to the Statistician’s publi-
cation, include water conservation, on which appar-
ently £42,816 was spent last year. The expenditure
in running this branch amounted to £14,657 ;
and the only items of revenue that can be traced
are “ Watering stock (tanks, &C.) £444,” and
“ Rent of public watering places, &c., £6324.” So
far from being a reproductive work, therefore, the
water-conservation branch seems to call for a sub-
sidy of over £ for £to pay working expenses. As
a matter of hard fact, there is no justification
for putting even the Railways under the heading of
reproductive undertakings, wherefore even the
Auditor-General’s classification is too generous.
Last year the Auditor-General published with his
report a valuable table (which for some reason has
been dropped this year), showing that, since 1891,
the N.S. W. railways have only twice paid the in-
terest bill, and for 13 years' they show a net
shortage of £2,154,190. In the past year they
added £54,887 to the deficit; and it is stretching
things a long way to label as “reproductive”
undertakings that have only paid their way
two years in 14. Would the Auditor-General
certify that a man was a sober person because,
though he was drunk 12 days in a fortnight, he
was moderately upright on the two Sundays when
the pubs were shut ? If, however, the Auditor-
General means that this man was sober compared
with the other man who took something home in
a bottle, and so kept up the Saturday drunk on
the Sunday, the matter is different. But in that
case it might be just as well to add a note to this
effect to any statement regarding the amount of
N.S. Wales’ “reproductive” debt—that, with
luck, it is reproductive one year in seven, while
the “partially reproductive” is less reproductive
than that.

The N.S.W. Arbitration Act.
The Carruthers Government proposes to deal
with the N.S. W. Arbitration Act in a character-
istic Carruthersy way. The Cabinet wishes to
abolish the Act; that is part of the price it is
pledged to pay to its Tory supporters. At the
same time it is afraid to propose, m a straightfor-
ward fashion, either repeal or vital amendment,
being not at all satisfied that there is a Parliamen-
tary majority prepared to ratify such a breach of
faith with the country, which consented to the
Arbitration experiment for a certain term, that
has not yet expired. The first indication of the
trend of the Government’s attitude was provided
when it “hung up” the operations of the Act
for a long period by failing to appoint a. Judge to
preside in the Arbitration Court. Obviously the
idea was then—as The Bulletin pointed out —to
quietly strangle the Act. But the growth of
public indignation upset that plan. Now a more
determined, though equally sneaking and under-
hand, effort is to be made to accomplish the same
purpose. The Arbitration Court is to be left in
existence, but side by side with it is to be
set up another industrial tribunal modelled
on the Wages Boards of Victoria. This new
tribunal is to have in all cases concurrent
jurisdiction with the Arbitration Court; it
will be also an appellate body from the
Arbitration Court’s decisions, which it may
vary or reverse ; and no case can be carried to the
Arbitration Court without the consent of both
parties and the decision of both parties not to go
before the Wages Board. It requires no special
knowledge of law to recognise that under this
system the power and usefulness of the Arbi-
tration Court must absolutely disappear. The
use of an Industrial Court, to which recourse
could only be had in the case of an agree-
ment by both parties, and against the decisions of
which an appeal could be made to another body
of inferior standing, would be nil. The only
reason why it should be permitted to survive after
this shearing of its responsibilities would be to


Even the most rigid of Tories are now
beginning to see the natural effect of Chinese
slavery on the Rand. From the Englishman
(India): —
The seriousness of this attitude consists chiefly in the
fact that for various reasons, but chiefly as the result of
the importation of Chinese labor, British immigration
into the Transvaal has ceased ; and as the
British element already in South Africa is either not so
prolific as the Dutch, or becomes imbued with Dutch
proclivities, the future of South Africa almost certainly
remains with the Boers. When we remember their indu-
rated character, and the abnormal length of their memo-
ries, it is difficult to regard the growing evidences of their
disaffection without serious qualms for the future.

The Harvester Trust Again.
The agents of the Yankee Trust which claims
to control 90 per cent, of the world’s trade in har-
vesting machinery are deadly anxious to get a
grip on the remaining 10 per cent., and, as a st; p
to that object, to wipe out the Australian manu-
facturers. The latest move has been the circula-
lation of a “special issue” of an alleged news
paper (which does not seem to be registered
at the Post Office) devoted to lying slanders of
the Australian manufacturers who have dared
to give a patriotic refusal to the offers
of the Trust, and wouldn’t sell out and
thus leave the Australian farmer at the mercy
of the folk who control the Standard Oil concern.
The Yankee Harvester Trust cannot, however,
argue out of the fact that the Harvester is an Aus-
tralian invention, which has been copied in
America and exported thence to compete with the
original inventors, and that it has been made for
very many years in Australia by different firms
under competitive conditions, at steadily de-
creasing prices. There is no reasonable chance
under Australian conditions of the manu-
facture of Harvesters falling into the hands
of a local trust, which would unfairly raise the
price to the farmer. If such an unlikely event
occurred, a prompt remedy would be always avail-
able to Parliament. But as a matter of fact, the
local makers are prepared to guarantee sale at a
lower price if adequate Protection is granted to
them. All the interests of Australia, agricultural
and industrial, are thus bound up with the success
of the Australian Harvester. If the American
Trust succeeds, not only will the Commonwealth
lose a flourishing industry, but the Australian
farmer will be liable to be bled white by the
Yankee exploiters. These trusts and combines
are not run for fun. Their method is invariably
to spend freely until they win a monopoly, and
then to bleed freely.
Comic-songster Bent had a jovial evening down
at Tatura (Vic.) last week, when the locals covered
him with congratulations re the Government’s
closer-settlement purchase of Wyuna estate.
Wyuna is Bent’s “bit of all right” among the
land purchases. But when the Overnewton estate
comes to be talked about, there’ll be no buttering
of Bent. He’ll sing no comic songs to the congre-
gated residents of the districts thereabouts. Over-
newton is going to be a matter for humble apology
or vociferous bluff—probably the latter. At
Tatura the other night Premier Tom was on
a lamentably good wicket. The president of
Rodney shire entertained him at dinner, and the
shire aforesaid is the favored country which
had its irrigation liability wiped off the slate.
Every acre of land on the west side of the Goul-
burn in the Rodney Trust is worth fully £2 more
than the non irrigated land of the east side. If
the Government had a sense of common justice it
Would even now repudiate the sinful cancelling
of that irrigation debt, and tax the improved land
according to its deserts. But as there is no appa-
rent fear of the fatted Rodneyites being made
to do the square thing until the Australian Govern-
ment taxes their land, they can afford to boil over
with enthusiasm whilst burly Thomas plays the
giddy ox. “ Right loud they laugh with counter-
feited glee at all his jokes, for many a joke hath
he.” The glee is not necessarily counterfeited in
the Rodney case. Bent is the sort of humorist
who really appeals to the hearts of farmers.
“L.C.” : Local Government is a grand institu-
tion, but in many Vic. shires the thing is just
bureaucracy on a small scale. Our Council is com-
posed of squatters, large farmers, and two or
three smaller men dependent on the others.
When there is an election, it is merely a sporting
event or the outcome of feudal animosity between
classes. An engineer and secretary are appointed,
or the offices are combined, as in our case; and
the officer runs the show. He is also the valuer,
and has a deep-rooted conviction that for rating
purposes the squattoeracy’s land is the poorest on
earth. He is allowed private practice and various
perks, which bring his income up to £5OO a year
or more. His private practice often takes him
away from the office for the better part of a week,
and his actual working time costs the shire
anything from £2 per day. He is allowed to
charge contractors a fee of per cent, on amount
of contract (maximum, £1) for preparing plans;
these fees, of course, are ultimately paid by the
ratepayers. The revenue of the shire is upwards
of £5OOO, and salaries and office expenses run to
over £5O0 —which sum has to be paid before any-
thing can be done to roads, &c. The councillors,
of course, have good, solid reasons for being
satisfied with their officer, and no complaint,
however well founded, has an “ earthly.” More-
over, the ratepayers have to be satisfied with their
councillors, for few men are foolhardy enough to
oppose the landed interest. Thus reform is only
remotely possible, and the danger of being ousted
a negligible quantity.

Last week Senator Soapy Gray, of N.S. W., again
told in Parliament the childish old taradiddle that
“New South Wales could sell her railways for a
sum that would more than cover the National
Debt.” Surely it isn’t worth the while of a grown
man, who professes to be in danger of having in-
telligence, to make a display of himself with such
crude boastings. If any co. bought the N.S. W„
railways for a sum large enough to pay off the
State debts, that co. would get rather less than
2 per cent, on its money. Does Senator Soapy
Guay know of any syndicate which wants to in-
vest about £80,000,000 at less than 2 per cent. ?
Also, can he point to any syndicate or company
that ever offered to buy the New South Wales
railways, even at a price that would pay
off half the State’s public debt? If a
company bought the Victorian lines at a price
that would pay off the Victorian public debt that
co. would make, at latest figures, 3 per cent, on its
money, so Victoria should have a much greater
chance of finding the sort of syndicate that Senator
Soapy Gray refers to than N.S.W. has—and Vic-
toria’s chance is just about nil. The kind of syn-
dicate which wants to invest over £50,000,000 at
3 per cent, is about as rare as the sea serpent.
But Victoria doesn't send to Parliament a petty
braggart of the Gray species to bring the State
into contempt and general dislike by his attitudes
of superiority, and that is something to its credit.
It is N.S.W.’s ill-luck that it'should be so largely
represented by Foreign-trade persons like Gray,
whose pomp and brag and airs of patronage recall
the mental attitude of the nigger field-marshal
when he has just composed his new uniform and
goes to review his standing army of two more
niggers.
■ ♦
State Premier Carruthers, of N.S. Wales, has
started early to manufacture a new grievance
against the Commonwealth Government. The
Braddon clause, which provides for a return to
the States of three-fourths of the tariff
revenue, can’t expire for five years yet, and
it won’t expire then unless Parliament formally
abolishes it. Unless it is formally abolished it
goes on for ever. But Carruthers, looking from
five to 500 years ahead, has written to Prime
Minister Deakin to demand that after the Brad-
don clause is abolished the Constitution shall be
altered “ to provide for the return of an adequate
fixed amount of revenue to each State.” In
this matter Carruthers is supposed to repre-
sent himself and various other State Premiers, but
these people evidently haven’t agreed among
themselves as to what is an adequate
fixed amount —at least, they don’t mention
any adequate amount. Presumably, the idea
is that the Federal Government should find
out what kind of a fixed amount will satisfy a
batch of State Premiers each of whom wants the
earth, and each of whom has an idea that
everything is a conspiracy to rob his State for the
benefit of all the other States, and that Deakin’s
failure to achieve this impossibility shall supply
Carruthers with another grievance. It would be
an interesting experiment if Prime Minister
Deakin replied simply that he would be glad to
hear from the State Premiers again when they
had all fully agreed among themselves as to how
much “fixed amount” each State should get, and
intimated that any State Premier who was killed
in the discussion would be buried at Federal ex-
pense. But though this would be a pleasant jest,
it is better left alone. The business of the Aus-
tralian Parliament is to entirely cease subsidising
the States, and to compensate them for the
loss of their tariff revenue by taking over
their debts, their old age pension responsibilities,
and their costly Education Departments. Every-
thing that reduces the necessity for communication
between the Australian Government and the
State Premiers is something gained for the cause
of union.

That vague, shadowy animal known as Pre-
ferential Trade wandered in an aimless fashion
through the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures
the other night. It was first dragged in to the
premises by manufacturer I. Jacobs, and then it
was a proposal that there should be a difference
of 10 to 20 per cent, of import duties, in favor
of all manufactures coming from the “Mother”
Country, with the proviso that the basis and
the guide in fixing all duties in the Common-
wealth tariff should be “the difference in
the relative cost of production in Great Britain
and Australia.” Second manufacturer J. Pender
objected to the shapelessness of the creature, and
suggested that Australia should demand the
original Kingston tariff as against Britain, and
25 per cent, more against every other country.
Third manufacturer W. A. Hartnoll said that
until Great Britain became Protectionist, and had
something to offer in return for Australia’s
preference, the preferential creature could be
nothing more than the shadow of a dream. Fourth
manufacturer J. K. Henderson asked what the
Australian tariff was, anyhow, and what was the
use of it if it wasn’t going to shut out the cheap
English competition, which in many lines was more
dangerous than any other form of competition.
Finally the preferential animal wandered forth
from the Chamber in the following form: —
That this Chamber reaffirms its approval of preferential
trade with Great Britain, subject to conditions giving
adequate Protection to Australian industries ; the prefer-
ence to Great Britain to be up to 25 per cent., and in
all such preference, consideration to be given to the
individual requirements of each industry.
And that is the extent to which the amorphous
creature has developed so far. When Australia*
by putting all outsiders really outside, has built
up healthy manufactures of its own, the pre-
ferential animal may possibly be belted into some
shape or other. And just as likely it may not.

For her last week in Sydney Miss Nance
O’Neil is going to the tomb and bringing forth a
Lazarus every night. Saturday it was “Ingomar,”
hitherto only played at a matinee; Monday,
“ Hedda Gabler ” ; Tuesday, “Marie Antoinette”;
“ Magda” for the Wednesday matinee, and Little
Billee s girl for the evening. Then, for to-night
(Thursday) “ The Fires of St. John,” put on thus
late so that Miss O’Neil may fly to her ’Frisco
boat if Sydney votes it too shocking and
raises a revolution. On Friday Miss O’Neil is
to give one act each from five plays, in-
cluding a “sleep-walking scene,” a “flower
scene,” and a “curse scene.” In the “In-
gomar” production she is Parthenia—a rather
poor Parthenia, failing in the lighter moods, and
getting but one, or at most two, chances to show
off her special tragic powers. But, in the costume
of a Greek maiden, Nance looks her very best.
She doesn’t have to change her clothes all the
evening, and that is good, because no change
could be for the better. Talking about clothes,
hairy Ingomar lets out a secret apparently without
intending to do it. The rather stilted old play is
about the Power of Love. Parthenia talks
a great deal of grandiloquent rubbish on the sub-
ject—the sort of thing you can get for a penny
with a paper pattern and advice on the subject of
cosy corners, and what to do with chapped hands,
and what to say when the Duchess of Shalots
ealls. Parthenia says she doesn’t under-
stand it all, and neither does anybody
else ; but, having quoted “Two souls with but a
single thought, two hearts that beat as one, ” the
hairy heathen and barbarian, Ingomar, lies down
on the grass and repeats it in rapture, just as
the old lady did that blessed word Mesopotamia.
It is all so beautiful, so sentimental, until Ingo-
mar remarks that Parthenia isn’t a bit like his
own heathen, barbarian women—they wear rough
skins for clothes, and don’t do up their hair
nicely, and never go to the massage parlor, or
brush their teeth. Parthenia doesn’t notice the
remark, of course—she’s too busy, like the rest of
the girls who go to matinees, in hoaxing her-
self that the beginning of love is some inscrutable,
poetic thing. But Ingomar had really given the
whole business away. Miss O’Neil’s support in
this piece was rather better than in some
others—John Glendinning’s Ingomar and Mario
Majeroni’s Polydor being specially worth men-
tion. But Gaston Mervale’s Massilian was very
bad ; the boss Greek’s remarks were, no doubt,
highly interesting, but most of the time they were
utterly unintelligible.
* * * *
A good deal of the Ibsen dramatic art is
to pourtray impossible characters in a series of
common-place conversations. The conversations
are “ natural.” Therefore the play is counted so,
though it may be made up of most unnatural inci-
dents and personages. “Hedda Gabler” shows
this art—it is art of an out-of-the-way kind, like
Japanese chinaware and Beardsley black-and-
white—in almost its highest expression. Juaged
by dialogue and trend of incident, the play is an
ordinary picture of domestic life. Really, it is
the pourtrayal of a woman far more savage and
repulsive than most of the villains of tragedy.
Yet Hedda is simply designed—merely the incar-
nation of all the bad qualities and desires of the
modern woman multiplied a hundred fold. She
is prurient, and so gives up her time before mar-
riage to extracting from a young cad in her train
of worshippers detailed information of his vices
(this they call “comradeship”). She is mean
and cowardly, and so delights in the small felini-
ties of middle-class women. She is jealous and
cruel, and doesn’t stop at destroying a precious
manuscript and inciting-an old lover to suicide be-
cause he has shown some response to the reforming
influence of another woman. She is greedy for
money and social position, and is willing to take
almost any means to get them. Withal she lacks
the saving sin of passion, and makes it brutally
plain to her man-friends that she means to remain
“ faithful ” —in the conventional sense—to her
husband. There are scores of women, unhappily,
who have some or many of these characteristics of
Hedda’s. But it is not natural to pack them all
into, one woman with no savor of a redeeming
quality. Hedda is not real; she is a savage satire
on the type of woman which the “new” move-
ment tends to produce, prurient but cold, cruel
but prudent, shrinking from the true work of
woman, but with not brains or character enough
to undertake any worthy work in another direc-
tion. Miss Nance O’Neil gives a reading of
Hedda Gabler which carries with it the fascina-
tion of the serpent. She looks always evil and
beautiful, and there is a shudder in her every
pose. It may not be the Hedda that Ibsen
imagined when he dipped his pen into the slime-
pot, but it’s a powerful and convincing horror.

At Sydney Criterion * ‘ Beauty and the
Barge ” is drawing so well that manager-actor
Brough sees no reason why he should shelve it
for another piece with more brains and less
farce. If even one of the barge hands would
dance a hornpipe in the bar-room scene, it would
make the proceedings more interesting, and this
chronicler would call again. But the public likes
“ B. and the 8.,” so a solitary growler- is neither
here nor there —especially there.

The Palace Theatre will exhibit to Sydney
folks on Saturday and succeeding nights a
“Famous Bio-Tableau and All-Star Picture
Show.” It is to include “authentic ” episodes of
the late war, and if they really are authentic
it will be an event in the history of a lying and
flickersome instrument, which has cheek enough
to present a picture of the battle of Nicopolis or
the battle of Hastings, and swear that the thing
was taken on the spot. Still, J. 0. Williamson
runs the show, and his word counts for much.
It is at least a guarantee that the flicker will be
reduced to a minimum.
** * *
“Between Two Women” will be with-
drawn from Sydney Royal after Friday, and on
Saturday “A Woman of Pleasure” is to be staged.
This is an exciting mixture of melodrama and
circus—the circus element being introduced in
scenes showing the relief of Mafeking, the town
which bore up, almost till its last dozen of ■paU de
foie gras, against a savage besieger who mostly
wasn’t there, and amused itself writing de-
spatches to the English papers about its diet of
curried cockroaches and mosquito soup. There
are many humorous possibilities about the siege of
Mafeking—if Mr. Anderson’s co. would be good
enough to show them.

Professional Musicians will give a fully-
gemmed concert next Saturday at Sydney Lyceum.
The first part will be under the direction of Mr.
Archie Fraser. Mr. Henry Weir and Mr. G.
Leopold are amongst those who will assist.

Miss Yiolet Mount’s farewell concert will
bring the high soprano close on £7O. It was worth
more, and the benefiting girl was at the acme of
her form in the good-bye numbers. Eighty
damsels in white gave Elgar’s “ The Snow,” under
conductor Asprey’s waving stick, and Messrs.
G. P. Wilkinson and R. L. Nield helped to make
the concert a success.

The more you look at the little French
couple who are doing the meehanical-Pierrot turn
at Sydney Tivoli, the cleverer you find them. At
first you don’t notice much but that the man’s
copy of an automaton is excellent; later on you
see what difficult things the automaton does in
the way of gymnastics. The billiard-ball jugglers
and the Diamond Duo continue to use up much ink
in the bills; and the pictures of the Gordon Ben-
nett motor race brought consolation during a spell
of windy days, for they show that there’s plenty
of dust m even the pleasant land of France. And
when your own eyes and ears are full, it’s com-
forting to think that others probably have a
mouthful as well.

“His Majesty's Servant,” which brought
the Jeffries-Knight co. back to Melbourne notice
at the Princess's last Saturday, is a roman-
tic drama of the gaudy, unconvincing order,
written a while ago, when costume plays were in
vogue and theatrical interest was centred in the
dead past. His Majesty is Charles the Second—
not the matured Charles who gave England a
number of Tottie duchesses and little dukes to
correspond, not the merry personage who sat in
Nell Gwynne’s high-backed chair, but the young
man Charles, with no kingdom to support his
title and pay his bills. The present drama shows
him as a fugitive, going into hiding whenever
General Lambert happens on his track. And
the “servant” of this royal dodger is Julius
Knight, disguised as Geoffrey Mohun, a
glaringly heroic actor of the period. The
Roundheads have shut down on barnstormers,
so there is nothing left for Julius but td come to
His Majesty’s rescue in time of need, and shout
for God and the King when the dramatist appeals
to his furious loyalty. An interval of nine years
between the first and second acts makes no ap-
preciable difference to the gallant Julius, or
General Lambert, or the pair of girls concerned in
the story, Charles seems to age a little, but the
others skip across the nine years as though Time
had paused for them. One of the girls, finding
that her long-winded devotion to Julius is of
no avail, accuses him of having wrecked her
reputation, or words to that effect, on the
evening of the last day when the audience saw
them together. And Julius permits the lie to go
unchallenged, because he has sworn to remain
silent for the sake of the other girl and on account
of the King. Therefore the other girl breaks off
her extraordinary nine years’ attachment to Julius,
and they part in a sad state of misunderstanding
which doesn’t upset the audience in the least.
The audience knows that the innocence of Julius
will come out strong at the finish, and that a
glorified grovel before the anointed King is bound
to ensue.

For such stagey-minded historical plays as
“ A. Royal Divorce ” or “ Sweet Nell” this country
has a large, paying public whose sympathies are
easily captured. But the defects in “His Majesty’s
Servant ” are too obvious to admit of it becoming a
great financial success. The love-story is foolishly
improbable; the King, of whom everybody talks so
much, has little to do with it; the dialogue is
sometimes trivial and the situations are forced.
Against these defects the picturesque costumes
and tin helmets of Lambert’s troopers, and the
splendid heroics of Julius Knight are not of suf-
ficient account. The play fails respectably. It
gives the leading man a brave show, and provides
a fairly good part for Arthur Wontner as the
King who conceals himself in sundry places.
Plimmer fills the part of the humiliated Genera


Lambert. The dear “little girl” is tall Miss
Jeffries (a striking instance of misplaced nobility).
Miss Hamer, essentially modern in her speech,
has to impersonate the unreal young woman who
suddenly weeps for her alleged disgrace of nine
years back, and is not cross-examined on the sub-
ject—and there are the others of the cast. Also
there is effective staging. The co. will probably
be seen next Saturday in a revival of one of the
older dramas.

Some new variety items are cropping up
in “The Cingalee,” at Her Majesty’s (Melbourne).
The Gollywog notion has been elaborated, and
Chambhuddy Ram introduces a travesty on
Thurston’s performance that raises a laugh and
advertises the wizard in question. Apart from
these irrelevant proceedings, “The Cingalee” re-
mains as before. Six times a week Miss Mus-
grove dollywogs, but she is spared the trouble on
Wednesday afternoons, when Miss Milne dolly-
wogs very successfully in her stead.

Thurston’s long stretch of last nights at the
Athenaeum Hall will terminate on Saturday, after
which occasion Melbourne will remember him
kindly as a producer of illusions and a deceiver
ever. One is sorry to part with one’s illusions,
especially when there is a girl in the case. And
in the Thurston case there are at least three girls.

Bland Holt changes his bill at Melbourne
Royal on Saturday next (30th). The melodrama
in view is “For England,” and the revival will
find employment for the full force of Bland’s
auxiliaries.

Maggie Stirling’s first concert at Mel-
bourne Town Hall settled all doubts as to whether
the popular ballad singer of six years ago had con-
verted her original Australian voice into a Euro-
pean contralto. Miss Stirling is not less of a
mezzo than ever she was. Her warble shows some
improvement in the production, achieved without
any sacrifice of its natural mellowdiousness, but
now as heretofore the singer is at her best in songs
where a sympathetic enunciation of the words is
of first importance. The selection for her opening
concerts included one or two pieces of foreign lan-
guage—notably the German version of “ Songs My
Mother Taught Me” —which might have been more
fetchingly uttered in English. The concert party
numbers only four, including the accompanist.
Miss Ethel Sinclair, a Melbourne violinist who
came back from London with Miss Stirling, is a
very likeable performer on a moderately good in-
strument, and one Adolphe Borschke, a very
young man of very girly appearance, contributes
solos on the piano. Adolphe shines as a player of
light, frivolous pieces. He has a soft, coquettish
touch when he pleases, and his smile, his com-
plexion, and his sweetness in general suggest that
he should fix up his long hair with a comb and
wear a wreath of roses on his snowy brow.
Adolphe may be described as a peach among
pianists.

The Players (now led up to the breach by
'Vivian Edwards, what time Gregan M‘Mahon is
otherwise engaged) fluttered “Lady Winder-
mere’s Fan ” at Melbourne Bijou on Saturday
evening last. No particular violence was done to
Oscar Wilde’s meaty epigrams and cynicisms,
and, take them all in all, the Players
scored once again a considerable success.
Mrs. Maurice Dudley played Mrs. Erlynne
with an intensity and truth of feeling seldom en-
countered even on the professional stage. Her
only fault is the amateur’s tendency to act too
quickly. Mr. Lawrence Hardinge, an excellent
comedian with a wide histrionic range, was not in
his most congenial element as Lord Windermere.
Also the latter part of the above clause applies
strongly to Mr. D. M. Beere. He played Lord
Darlington, the seductive tempter of innocence
who self-reprovingly relents when his efforts are
crowned with non-success, as though he had been
especially bottled to fill that sort of human jug.
Miss Georgina O’Meara and some of the others
have done better in previous struggles with polite
comedy.

At Melbourne Opera House there is a well-
sustained rush of plain, ordinary multitude and a
steady inflow of rank and fashion. The three
magicians, together with the four Jacksons and
the balance of the company, will repeat themselves
to crowded houses for the next two or three weeks,
presumably. For the sake of the principal
“turns,” which cover nearly an hour of space
between them, a patient public deals gently, as a
rule, with the feeblest of the minor “ turns,” but
last Saturday night a lady vocalist got an impolite
reception when she came along to chant a second
ditty. It is a peculiarity of the Rickards show
that the people who might be forgiven for perpe-
trating one song only are invariably engaged to do
it twice.

Adelaide, having spent most of its money
during Show week, was not able to keep up, to the
end, the pace at which it originally supported
“ Pretty Peggy.” Also, the piece is too much
like sundry other old plays, though the death-
scene on the stage of what the programme per-
sisted in calling “ Convent Garden ” had a novel
setting. At time of writing “ Old Heidelberg ’’ is
running, and Nellie Stewart serves drinks to a num-
ber of local amateurs who appear as students, and
a general atmosphere of Serene Highnesses and
college-choruses and Lager Beer prevails. At the
Tivoli John F. Sheridan bounced through the
part of the footman-bailiff for some nights, but
got into the familiar skirts of the Widow O’Brien
for his farewell appearance. Frank Clark has
now come back from Broken Hill with Harry
Shine, the Stagpoles, and the rest of his variety
co., for a short so-called “ theatrical ” season of
“ Muldoon’s Picnic.”
Apropos of the alleged idea of the Kaiser
that the Baltic Sea should be closed to all ships
except those belonging to the Powers on its coast,
it is less than 60 years since Britain tried to shut
the Baltic Sea against Germany itself. In 1848,
the German coast being blockaded by the Danes,
the young Germanic Confederation, which then
had no navy, rushed enthusiastically into the
marine store business, and scratched up a fleet of
old merchant brigs and smaller craft, including
row-boats. The following year it put to sea and
challenged the Danes, and then the British
Government had the gratuitous cheek to notify
the Legislature at Frankfort that its flag—the
venerable banner of the Holy Roman Empire—
“being unknown on the seas, vessels using it ex-
pose themselves to be treated as pirates.” The
Confederation was thunderstruck, the little armada
was recalled and not long afterwards sold by
auction. And the colors which were “unknown
on the seas” were those carried by Don Juan of
Austria's ships at Lepanto.
AT POVERTY POINT.
According to a private letter from England the plump
and figuratively pleasing Annette Kellermann is quite a
considerable sensation in the Cold Country, and draws
great crowds wherever she puts in an appearance in her
somewhat scarce costume. On the occasion of an exhi-
bition swim at Ramsgate the onlookers were so enthusias-
tic that crowds waded into the water to capture the
mermaid, and buxom Annette was only rescued after
strenuous exertions on the part of eight stalwart
coppers, who bore away the dripping damsel among
them. Happy policemen! Miss Kellermann, although
she hasn’t full clothing on, and what she has is generally
wet, says that she does not find the country ( cold.
Perhaps she is so crowded that the cool breeze can’t get
at her.
Song words from “The Cingalee” are matters for grave
reflection when one finds them advertised in cold news-
papef print. For instance :
Once a Golly wog loved a Dollywog,
Wog, vvog, wog, wog.
It was folly wog of the Golly wog,
Wog, wog, wog, wog.
Surely nothing worse than that can happen in the way of
comedy drivel. The one thing that can be said in “ The
Cingalee’s ” defence is that this particular rubbish wasn’t
in the original.
“ The place I will remember most on the Australian
tour is the little town of Wangaratta. It was the only
place in the whole of Australia where I was not told to
get m3' hair cut.” — Paderewski.
It was announced by no less an authority than London
Tedegraph that Miss Carrie Moore would take principal
part in the new musical corned}', “ The Blue Moon,”
another lady having dropped out; but a few days later
came the statement that Miss Billie Burke would collar
the “ fat.” As an all-round entertainer Miss Burke is not
equal to Australian Carrie, but it takes a long time to get
past the lad}' who has already a hold on public attention.
At Thurston’s show in Melbourne, the other night, the
magician had the luck to get a singularly smart kiddie
from the audience to assist him in his egg trick, which
depends largely on the little stranger for humorous effect.
Thurston takes the first youngster who is willing to
mount the platform, and as often as not he draws a blank
—a mere stodgy juvenile with no idea of entering into the
joke. This night the casual kiddie was an enormous
success. It turned out to be the young hopeful of
Brightie Smith, of Bland Holt’s co. The infant Smith
has “ been on” in melodrama more than once, and is
quite at home on the stage.
George Elton (son of Billy Elton), lately with William-
son and Musgrove, now understudies Cyril Maude, of the
Hayinarket, London. Alice Crawford, the Bendigo girl,
is also in the company, and appeared with success as
Josephine in “ The Creole ” to Mr. Maude’s Napoleon.
Joseph Gillott, formerly well-known as a musician in
London, is having a comic opera of his composition pro-
duced in Sheffield, England. The opera is said to be ex-
cellent stuff, yet it took composer Joseph years to secure
the Sheffield production, whilst as for the London
managers, he found it impossible even to secure appoint-
ments with them to hear the work. Gillott is a nephew
of Melbourne’s Samuel.
Even if the “ male impersonator ” could be taken
seriously in other respects, she would be sure to give
herself away by an occasional affectionate pat on her
back wig. Even Florence Lloyd is no exception to the
rule.
Bent, at Brighton the other day, claimed that he once
acted Romeo. Thomas does not say he brought down the
house, but it seems probable that he brought down the
balcony.
“ 0.K.” : The alleged increase of musical enthusiasm in
Melbourne is not noticeable. Probably there was a falling
off this winter in the attendance at Marshall Hall’s
orchestral concerts, for there never was any overflow,
although the seating accommodation had been lessened
by the Prof.’s device of extending the platform several
feet forward. Some capital chamber music concerts were
poorly patronised. Hugo Heermann passed unnoticed
except by the small-sized crowd who swore his cold,
classic fiddling was worth sixpence a minute in spiritual
satisfaction. And now it seems that the two liedertafels —
the Metropolitan and the Melbourne—that have existed
on their respective owns for 30 years or more, are about to
roll themselves into a single body under the name of the
Royal Victorian Liedertafel ; which means, of course, that
both of the old institutions have been losing subscribers.
“Willbra” : See by The Buldetw that a long-haired
person has been recently exploiting his experiences
in New Guinea. Said gentleman did really pay a
visit to this country, and spent some weeks here,
mostly at sea. So he didn’t have many hairbreadth
escapes from wandering cannibals or wild missionaries.
He has found one of the lost tribes in the Kiwais (mouth
of the Fly River), and must have had considerable oppor-
tunity of observing them, as the Ysabel stops at Daru for
several hours. Apart from their distinctly Hebraic
appearance—quite common in Polynesia—the only points
of similarity between the Kiwais and the Badly-Chosen
People consist in their superior intelligence and inordinate
lust for the Papuan equivalent of woman and wine.
“Hiphen”: I witnessed “Leah Kleshna,” which is to
be played here shortly, in the Cold Country. It is a strong
play with a weak ending-such a kind of ending that,
were it a prize-fight, the referee would stop it and give
the money to charity. Leah Kleshna is the daughter of a
professional thief, and is herself no slouch at the game.
Being a good-looking wench, she has great success in
rifling the rooms of timid and bashful young men, who,
when they discover her, have to request her to leave the
apartment while they slip on their—ahem—dressing gown
before ringing up the police. Leah, however, meets
her Waterloo when she tries to separate Paul Sylvain, a
French Deputy (who is the Tommy Bent of his
country), from his family jewels. When he dis-
covers her in the dead o’ night, she promises him
a funeral with the utmost celerity and a revolver. But
he is undismayed, and starts in to save the soul which he
is sure exists beneath the low-cut evening dress in vvhich
Leah is more or less encased. Then follows an impassioned
scene (which comes near to rant), and finally Paul Sylvain
Bent leaves her alone with the jewels, and tel}s her to take
them or leave them, and to please herself. Thereupon,
the dormant good in Leah is much touched, and she goes
out leaving the ger-littering jewels on the table. They
are discovered there by the villain, Paul’s prospective
brother-in-law, who enters (naturally) by the window,
full of evil intent and wine. He also for some time past
has been trying to save Leah for himself. The grass
being short in his paddocks at the time through losses
in Tattersalls, he takes the diamonds, and when Paul
finds them gone he thinks he has made a mistake, and
calls himself an ass, and brays. The matter is cleared up,
however, and Leah retires to her native home in Poland.
In the weak-kneed last act she is discovered some years
later in the company of bestial-looking Poles,
chasing slugs off a lettuce plantation. Enter Paul
the Spruce, who has meantime been jilted by his fiancee
because of the discovery of some of Leah’s wardrobe in
his room on that memorable night. He tells her that for
him the sun only shines through her front teeth, and
that though he is not a land-agent, he has a bit in the
savings bank. Whereupon Leah retires to change her
clogs, and they start for the Registry-office. The play
ends by the curtain falling.
Dan Barry doesn’t confine his audacious eloquence to
the bush townships. He gives it to them just as strong
when he is touring the outskirts of Melbourne. Witness
this lovely quote fropi a poster advertising “The Parson’s
Nose ” or “ The Parson’s Oath ” at a suburban town hall: —
“ Never before have such immense, delighted and repre-
sentative throngs been seen in the above hall as those
which each week greet our popular performances. To hear
the hearty, healthy, hilarious merriment, and watch the
sea of human faces bright and vital with intellectual
interest and happy enjoyment is in itself a source of the
keenest human delight. The adults present of all ages,
from the bright-eyed maiden in her teens, with her best
boy at her side, to the greybeard of venerable aspect, with
his wife, the companion of his declining years, at his
elbow, all greet our performances with cheers upon
cheers, while to the little ones present our weekly drama-
tic entertainments come as a delicious deluge of delight.”
W. T. Stead advises Beerbohm Tree to go to a “good
materialising stance ” before his next revival of
“Hamlet,” to see what a real ghost is like. But there
seems to be degrees of reality in spookland, for Stead
goes on to intimate that the genuine 18-carat ghost is
invisible, and let’s the haunted person know it’s a-iookin’
at him only by the voice or other sounds. This opens up
pleasing visions of a revised version of “ Hamlet,” with
Ophelia turned into the usual h-less brand of spiritualistic
medium, asking the rapping Ghost “ Are you ’appy. ”
and “Are you numbered among the ’eavenly ’ost?” Or
as a trance medium she would reply, on behalf of the
Ghost, “ O ’Amlet, I will ’arrow up thysoul! O ’orrible!
O ’orrible ! most ’orrible ! ”
Adelaide Theatre Royal closes at the end of this
month to allow of extensive alterations inside. Already
workmen have been pushing on with the improvements
for some months, and at times actors have had to dress
in half dressing-rooms, and hang their trousers on drain-
pipes, etc. At a matinee during the Knight-Jeffries
recent season, plumbers began nailing on the roof just
when Knight was doing a fine bit of silent acting. The
audience was sorry it was Knight who was acting, and
not George Rignold. Henry V.’s Soliloquy to a Plumber
on the Roof would have been worth hearing.
A London danseuse, engaged for minor parts on the
Sydney boards, stood out for several days for a written
guarantee that she would be entertained on arrival in
Sydney by the gaud Mayor and aldermen. Her mother
was a Gaiety Girl, and she had grown up to think that all
Sydney Mayors are as cheerful as Sammy Lees.
A woman who had made a specialty of fasting exhi-
bitions was recently found by the German police in a
destitute state. She lamented that she could not get a
fasting - engagement to provide herself with food !
Melbourne Town Hall will shortly 7 be fitted up with a
boss organ. For vears it had one which was worse than a
treadmill to make music on. The new one is electro-
pneumatic and a marvel of scientific skill. The whole
business is worked by electricity. About 60 switches and
five keyboards give the organist complete control of
the fine instrument. The great feature about the new
contrivance from an organist’s point of view is that
he can arrange four different combinations of stops before
he commences to play 7 and can bring each of them into
operation whenever he pleases by merely flicking on a
switch. The thing is all switch.
Comedian Hugh Ward strikes success wherever he goes.
At latest he was the central figure of a “ Revue ” at the
Olympia, in Paris, and the papers were saying all
sorts of good things about him, with notes of exclamation
liberally interspersed to show that admiration could go no
further. The Echo de Paris remarks tha,t Ward dances
and gesticulates with a “fantasie irresistible,” whilst Le
Journal says that “ Under the appearance of a scarecrow
that extraordinary fellow, half ghost and half man, makes
his appearance in the piece. He doesn’t speak, he gesticu-
lates, he mimics, he dances. Metis quel mime et quel
danseur!” Incidentally the Journal calls a scarecrow a
“ Sara-Orow.” Ward is shortly off to his native America
on a nine months’ engagement.
“T.D.”: Passing ’Arry Rickards in Leicester Square
to-day, after putting in a couple of hours torment at
London Coliseum last night, set me a-thinking. Had
’Arry put on any one of the turns in Sydney or Mel-
bourne, with the single exception of a well-staged scene
from “ Faust,” with Tasmania’s Pringle as Mephisto, the
thing would have been howled off. The Coliseum, with
its revolving stage and a heap of money 7 spent in scenic
effects and chorus and supernumerary, is just a panorama
of good old has-beens, yet it is crowded regularly by the
admirably patient Cockney, who has not ceased to
worship 'people for the magic of their names and the
things they used to do twenty or thirty years ago. Here
were to be seen on the one night Rutland Barrington
(degenerated from comic opera starring to the comedian’s
dotage of dying at the end of a pathetic ballad surrounded
by much limelight), Mabel Love (who may have been
a passable singer ten years ago, but certainly isn’t now),
a wheezy Courtice Pounds, and worst of all, the Gown
Trotter. Last-mentioned lady appeared as Columbine in
the big scene from “ Pagliacci,” and accentuated her
thinness and angularity and very flat feet a hundredfold
in “ tu-tu ” skirts and painful efforts to twirl a la
Genee, of the Empire ballet. Barrington and Brown
Potter beautifully 7 illustrate the seventh stage of that
Being Apart, the mummer ; the male kind always wants
to die pathetically, and show that he might have been a
great tragedian ; and the female kind strives hard to
make her final kick that of an eighteen-year-old coryphee.
David Belasco, the opponent of the American Trust as
applied to the drama, has been say’irig things to a London
newspaper. He prophecies that unless the English stage
takes warning, London managers will be absorbed by
combinations engineered in New York. The complaint
in the Great Fog at present is that the theatres are run,
not so much for the benefit of the performance or the
playgoer, as for that of the middleman, who sits like the
Old Man of the Sea on the shoulders of almost every
manager in London.
The Earl of Shaftesbury, who one time appeared in Mel-
bourne (in “ Lelamine ”) for one consecutive week as a
comic-opera tenor, is now on the directorate of the Royal
Academy of Music. Shaftesbury, married to a daughter
of the Duke of Westminster, is a person to be taken quite
seriously.
“BeauS.”: Was recently asked to play in an amateur
distortion of one of Henry Arthur Jones’playlets. The
friend w 7 ho asked me knew I was in the journalistic line,
and this is what he said : “ We are going to play it in a
few weeks’ time. There is not a part for you, but you
could write one, and work it in for yourself, couldn t
you?” I couldn’t decide whether I should be a sailor
bounding on his vessel’s deck, or a violent criminal
in a dungeon, so I dropped out of the show.
“T.D.”: Pat Bathurst, formerly of Williamson’s eo.,
who has been working steadily at voice culture in London
for a couple of years s .wout to make a start as lead of a
touring musical comedy 7. When Bathurst arrived he had
chances to go into w 7 ork of the Hayden Coffin variety,
which mostly consists in uplifting large, dreamy eyes and
a small, amorous voice to a girl with a set smile and five
guineas’ worth of pearly teeth. But Patrick tvas sensible
enough to recognise that he had too much of the man in
him for that sort of thing, and he held out until he could
secure a part more in accordance with his manner. He
filled in time getting vocally and musically fit, studying
with old Santle.v, and Australian audiences would
scarcely recognise the rough-and-ready Bathurst of the
old days were they to hear him now.
In “Mrs. Dooley’s Little Joke.” Mrs. Dooley (John F.
Sheridan), on hearing of her son-in-law’s supposed ac-
quaintance with a strange lady, says: “The Brigham
Young! The Sultan of Johore ! ” Mr. Johore left a very
jnduring reputation hereabouts.
Touching the difference between genuine musical prodi-
gies of the Mozart order, and the laboriously trained
youngsters who are mostly the offspring of music teachers,
somebody remarks that “the prodigy ousn ess of the real
prodigy consists in his achieving the greatest results with
the smallest amount of practice, whilst with others a little
is achieved bv prolonged exercises. The prodigy is born
with abnormal executive aptitude, which may or may not
be allied with musical intelligence, but it enables the child
to make the utmost of all he has.” And the marvellous
infant musician is invariably a boy. For that matter, the
onlv wonderful child mummer on record was a boy—
Master Betty—who lived for 80 years after he had earned
a fortune by playing Hamlet, Macbeth, &c. The natural
precocity of girls is limited in its power of artistic achieve-
ment whereas the unnatural talent of the occasional
urchin can hardly be overstrained. Unlike the girls, he
shows no sense of his peculiar cleverness —has no airs
and graces when off duty. Master Betty was just a
bright, intelligent kiddie w 7 ith a prodigious memory. He
learned the longest Shakspeare parts quite easily, re-
membered every thing he was told to do in acting them,
and between the acts he played marbles w 7 ith a mate.
His troubles about being a prodigy ! The boy was not even
as a girl is when she comes before the public,
[n his early manhood he made his re-appearance behind
the footlights, because there was a demand for him, but
finding himself no great shakes he soon retired for good.
“ L.E.” on art: —
Ballarat, the art centre of the universe, lately broke
out with violence over the matter of painting a damp
wall. The president (James Oddie, F.G.S.) thought one
of the Gallery walls should be lined with wood to keep
out the wet; but the secretary, reckoning- both
sides at £l2 a side, thought woodwork would be
too expensive, so he got an estimate for painting.
The president took him before the council tor
insubordination. He had no right to mention either
(1) wood on both sides, or (2) painting. The angry and
ancient president likewise accused the secretary of having
pledged his (the ancient’s) pictures to the Government
while he was away in Fogland. Th's ancient took the chair,
ruled some people out of order who tried to argue w.th hun,
and suppressed people »nd things enthusiastically, till the
Council bubbled over With wrath. The secretary denied
the charge and said he lad nothing- to apologise for. Ihe
aggressively artistic people present spoke their minds as
freely about that wall as ever did the old Athenians over
a new statue by Phidias. Many would have engaged in a
sanguinary civil war rather than yield one inch of wood-
work on that wall that let the wet through. Finally the
Council nased a unanimous resolution that the secretary
had not been guiltv of anything. r lhereupon the flabber-
gasted president said that out of the 100 pictures he had
loaned to the Gallery he would now remove &0 to the
lunatic asylum at Wendou ee. One of the committee men
who had attended that pleasant evening’s discussion fell
down dead before midnight. They fight hard for art iu
Ballarat.

want legislation that will promote its fair distribution.
But it is equally true that Freetrade and good industrial
legislation should go together. If a country persuades
itself that it can become rich by borrowing, importing,
and “ going on the land,” then it should insist that the
importer and the cocky shall pay a fair living wage for
eight hours’ work, so that the imaginary wealth may be
fairly distributed Unsuitable :—M.S.H., Chas. K.

to this particular creditor) because he was unable
to make any further payments.

A most complicated case :
St. Vincent’s Hospital (Melb.) art union was at least
successful in introducing- a champion liar to notice.
William Patrick Naughton, the person convicted of cap-
turing £5OO of art-union prizes by fraud, has thusfar made
three statements as to how the swindle was worked.
Firstly he told a detective that he spirited the winning
tickets, in a Thurstonian manner, from certain bundles of
unsold tickets. Then he nullified this unconvincing-story
with another confession to the effect that his ballot-barrel
was a faked apparatus, whereby the winning marbles were
ejected by a secret spring- from a tube where he had
hidden them. Finally, on his day of judgment, the varie-
g-ated liar made a long speech from the dock, describing
himself as a poor, innocent Naughton, who never knew
where the winning tickets came from, but had amiably
assisted a friend (his intended brother-in-law) to convert
them into cash. His previous statements, he told the
court, had been forced from him by the detective, who
promised to “ hush the matter up ” in the interests of
the unfortunace hospital if he (the prisoner) would
made over all his money to the Mother Rectress for the
sake of appearances. After the “liush-up” he was to
get his money back and be discharged without a stain on
his character. This amazing and abortive narrative
seems to have been meant to display Naughton as a
victim of a R.C. detective’s sectarian enthusiasm, but in
its plan of construction it was the weakest of the three
yarns in his repertoire. In giving it an anti-Catholic
tone Naughton may have hoped to get the sympathy of
any Orangeman among- the jury, and perhaps he is
rightly described in the prison register as a Scotchman
and a Wesleyan. On the other hand, it is more probable
that he lied about his nationality and his religion, and
will presently describe himself as a Baptist by the name
of Brown.

William P. Naughton, the ballot-box
expert, who was found guilty of getting at the
St. Vincent’s Hospital art union for all the prize-
money, is said to have been mixed up with some
peculiar circumstances in Maoriland. He bossed
the drawing of a Sisters of Mercy art union in
Auckland, and all the principal prizes were
won by the girl he was engaged to. There
were suspicions then, but William P. Naughton
threatened large libel actions, and as no one knew
more than that he seemed to be engaged to a very
lucky girl, the voice of slander died away in the
dim, dim distance. Now the voice of slander is
calling out pretty loudly again.

Wild rumors shook Geelong (Vic.) to its
foundations the other day. Bent was visiting an
agricultural show in the Sleeping City, and rolled
out of the train at North Geelong, in company
with a veiled lady, with whom he walked to
Osborne House, which the Government has
bought as a consumptive home, or a summer resi-
dence for Tallbottle, or something. Then Bent
appeared at Geelong without the lady. By
evening Common Report was as big and as strong
as a horse, and smelt like a herd of over-ripe ele-
phants, and all male Geelong was wondering
whether it would be breach of privilege or lese
majeste, or the other thing, to go out and inspect
Bent’s tenant. Some people said she was Bent’s
beautiful and accomplished relative, while others
said it was shocking. And Geelong felt vastly
disappointed when it learned that the Veiled One
was a caretaker, and that she had her husband
with her, and that Bent hadn’t a suspicion upon
his character.

A young girl was cremated in Adelaide
the week after the Medical Congress met there.
The crematorium had not been called into use for
nearly a year, and the visiting doctors who wanted
to see the plant in operation had to be content
with the burnt ruins of a sheep. Immediately
afterwards came the genuine call. This is the
first time a woman’s body has been cremated in
Tortoise Town.

figured in one capa-
city or the other,
and most of them
have unblushingly
admitted, in com-
munications to the
affronted husbands,
that they are thor-
oughly guilty, sug-
gesting at the same
time that the matter
was really not worth
bothering about. In
one case, the co-re.
arranged with the
petitioner, a Judge
in the West Indies,
to pay over a little
sum of about £3OOO, so long as he wasn’t V>ored
by the case being spun out, and the aggrieved
J udge was good enough to hand over the amount
to his late wife, just to show that he was really
annoyed, and didn’t wish to reap any profit from
her philandering.

There is nothing in all the squalid records
of the police courts to compare for squalor with
the case in which the leading characters consist of
the Chinaman, and the white woman who is
married to a Chinaman, and the half-caste offspring,
and the kind of white man and woman who
associate with Chinamen. An instance is the case
of Leigh, who wanted £5OO damages from Eynch,
which trouble straggled at great dingy length
through the Sydney papers last week. It became
dismally uninteresting as it crawled along, but
taking a casual glance over it one met constantly
remarks about Mr. Ah Duck, about Mrs. Ah
Duck who was really Mrs. Phillips but who was
“supported” by Mr. Ah Duck, about the man
who. lived by bottle-washing and had been
married by Parson George Hay to a woman
who was out on bail charged with vagrancy,
about the woman who smoked opium and came
home drunk, about the beer that was sent
for and paid for with the drunken man’s
money, about Jimmy Lee the Chinaman, about
the lady who had two drinks and was then found
in bed with a strange, intoxicated citizen, who was
trodden on, and woke up, and proceeded to fight,
about the row in a three-roomed wooden house
with a broken “colonial oven ” in it, and about
multitudes Of small, stuffy details of the same sort.
Exactly how it ended The Bulletin doesn’t re-
collect, but all through it there were beer, and
Chinamen, and three-roomed wooden houses, and
abusive language, and ladies who indignantly
denied having ever been charged with anything
worse than vagrancy, immorality or drink. And
all through it could be faintly heard the voice of
the undesirable alien saying “ Whaffor ? ”
Joseph Ward, of Maoriland, lately ex-
pressed a hope that some member of the Royal
Family would come out to open the International
Exhibition, at Christchurch, next year. Perhaps
a cheap line of royal goods may be obtained ; the
British royal family is so prolific that princelets
are fairly common.
“ G.H.”: The loss of the manyth conse-
cutive hat in a barber’s shop suggests that it is up
to somebody to invent a venomous hat that will
bite anyone but the lawful owner. The teeth in
the hat should be sufficiently poisonous to slay the
thief fatally dead on the spot. Failing that, a hat
that would bark loudly when taken by the wrong
party, and thus show up the illicit hat-taker,
would be an excellent idea. I know
a lot of men who would be will-
ing to put money into a com-
pany for manufacturing un-
stealable hats.

His tackle com-

iron into the upper branches
of a likely tree and then
hauled away. Sometimes he
got a bite, but more frequently
he cast without result. A cripple
stood by offering congratulations when a good haul
was made, and collecting the hard earned fire-
wood in a bag.

A pompous Sydney barrister with political
aspirations cross-examining witness in a dismissal
case, the other day : “ Did your employer ever in-
timate to you that the diminution of your pro-
ducing power must result in a corresponding de-
cline of your remuneration ? ” Witness: “ Naw ! ”
“ Did he ever give you to understand anything of
the kind?” “Naw!” “Will you kindly tell
the court exactly what he did say ? ” “He said
he would have to dock me dashed wages ’cause I
was gettin’ too dashed slow ; that’s what ’e said ! ”■
SUFFERING UNDER BASE SUSPICIONS.
Professor David, of Sydney University, in a recent
lecture, stated that Australians must needs be over-
dilute, and therefore driven to lean against posts, because
our average temperature is 13deg. higher than that of
England and Wales.
“Now, don'choo go makin' any mistake (hie).
I'm not drunk (hie), I'm over-dilute, I am
Nothin' common about me. Whoop!”
“ T.D.” : I was never much in the way of
meeting ecclesiastical personages in Australia, but
since I’ve been in England, just 12 months, I’ve
been pestered weekly with begging letters from
peripatetic bishops from out there. Apparently
their sole aim in life is to rush round the country and
collect a little boodle for “ the diocese.’’ Opened
yet another letter to-day, this time from the
Bishop of Perth, who is just now invading the
country seats of the British mighty, and collecting
guineas, and presumably having a good time. The
gaitered one wishes me to go somewhere and hear
him lecture, and mentions in large type that he is
raising a fund for the glorification of his diocese.
Needless to say I’m going, and taking the cash
along in a barrow. I came with just the one
object of helping Bishop Riley to float around
among duchesses and the like.
A PLEA FOR SKITE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the backblocks we are breeding- a race little better
than the blacks. . . . The city streets are filled with
stunted, weedy brats ... a race of degenerates.—
Liddell, M.H.R.
A mild, admonitory rhyme
I wish to make in homely phrase,
’Tis of our bright Australian clime
And too-benign Australian ways.
We are a people who have shown
Ourselves to be extremely fit,
Even if we run to skin and bone ;
We’ve got a country of our own,
Although we’ve messed it up a bit.
Then why don’t you
Australians true
Skite, lie, and fight for country as all other peoples do ?
We’ve heard about Australian blow
From fierce John Bulls, who ran with grease,
And heated arguments to show
Their country is God’s masterpiece ;
And meek Australians all agreed
That far-off land they do not ken
Was most magnificent indeed,
And that the men from there exceed
All other makes and kinds of men.
And they’re not slow
To visit woe
On any slanderous foreign cuss who says it is not so.
Australians, “ Awake ! Arise ! ”
Go take your little trumpets curled,
And blow a blast to shake the skies,
And wake an echo in the world.
Let’s raise a big, bold, brazen band,
With Austral sentiment agog,
To whoop ourselves and all our brand,
And skite about our native land
As now we skite about our dog—
To land ge-whiz
On any phiz
That hints this country ain’t immensely greater than
she is 1
The soul is base that will not lie
About his native land, and swear
That dim and bleary is the eye
That does not see all beauty there.
So crack ours up, recite with zest
The splendid story of her worth,
And bellow it to East and West
Of all the lands this is the best
At any mortal thing on earth.
The grand, the great,
The fruitful State
Is wooed with fine unreason, and mad ardor is her mate !

TRUE LOVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The trustees of the St. Kilda (Vic.) Cemetery are
inquiring for the whereabouts of H. Trueiove, their late
secretary. —News item.
When true love flies,
And Cupid comes to be
Just merely an objectionable kid child,
And all the scented paths of Arcady
Are broken asphalte, dust-and-germ-defiled,
The poets rise,
Throughout the ages with a tingling lyre,
To ask the right direction and inquire
Where true love flies.
Where Trueiove is,
The poet’s passioned plaint
Has been surpassed by infinite degrees
With some suggestions wise, and some that ain’t,
Set by St. Kilda burial trustees,
Agreeing his
Location this time will more likely be
Some fairer spot than their old cemet’ree
Where Trueiove is.

To be called a returned cohentmgenter is
now regarded by the Melbourne police as a deadly
insult. Panton, P.M., laid it down in Melbourne
City Court (Sept. 18): “I will not have the fact
that some members of the police force were
soldiers who had served in the South African
war mentioned in the Court.” When the faim-
burning hero first returned he was met by Minis-
ters of the Crown and carried off to get beef and
whisky. Later on he was brought back on a
fever-ship, and when he landed he was allowed
to walk home. Now, he takes a back street and
asks only for beer and obscurity, and he has to
pay for the beer. t m *
After all, the birth-mark which identifies
the long lost cheeild and exposes the changeling, is
not a mere melodramatic figment; it does exist in
real life sometimes. At the Sydney Water Police
Court, the other day, a young girl was charged
with destroying property. Her putative mother
gave evidence that, some years ago, she left her child
in custody in England. Eighteen months ago she
sent for the offspring, and received by return post
a girl, but not her girl—the birth-marks were dif-
ferent. However, she took the changeling some-
what to her bosom, but found her uncontrollable,
and now wished to be free of all responsibility for
her. The girl furiously claimed that the witness
was" her mother, but she had no birth-mark testi-
mony to ajlege in support (she had neglected to
observe her mother’s birth-marks), and she was
fined for her offence and left motherless.
The Randlords’ yarn that the imported
Chow slaves would increase white employment
proves true enough. The Transvaal Government
has just issued an ordinance allowing Euro-
peans £1 and exes, for every escaped Chow slave
returned to his owner. Thus is the brand-new
occupation of Chow-hunter started.

Bent seems to have been pulling Mel-
bourne’s leg when he flashed out with an announce-
ment the other day that, since the religious folk
professed to be shocked at the running of Sunday
trains, he would stop them all—not only the
trains which carried people away from the City of
Dreadful Sunday to the hills and the seaside, but
also the trains which carried the holy in from the
suburbs to the fashionable city churches. Appalled
at the prospect of getting exactly what they had
asked for, the unco guid, who really only wanted
the country excursion trains stopped in the in-
terests of thripenny, rushed forward in protest.
Then Bent smiled all over his countenance and
partly over his stomach, and remarked briefly
that he had not meant what he said and didn’t
intend to stop any trains. Whereat there was
relief in the tents of the godly, who, on the whole,
would prefer that a certain number of thripennies
should be exported to the country than that the
great mass of thripennies should be stuck up in
the suburbs for want of means of locomotion to the
fashionable city churches.
THE ATTACHED ORIFICES.
QUARTERMASTER ( instructing recruits in the sounding
machine): “ 'Ere we ’ave a piece of lead with two

Premier Bent landed a severe body blow
on those parsons who, as he elegantly put it, are
kicking up a fine hullabaloo ” about the Bible m
State schools, notwithstanding their defeat at
the referendum, when he said recently, at North-
cote-" There are more children attending
the Sunday schools—on the ministers own figures
-than there are attending the State schools,
Did they mean, then, that what they imparted on
the Sabbath had so little effect that it was entirely
lost during the week ? ”
“ G.H.” : Controversy is now raging
amongst the committee which is superintending
X erection of the Queen Victoria statue on Yarra
Bank Melbourne. One portion of the committee
wants to drag an expensive block of Italian marble
overseas from Carrara, and the other and more
patriotic section reckons that the marble obtained
It Caloola (N.S.W.)is good enough to memorialise
any King or Queen who ever drew his or her salary
with royal regularity. Had a talk, the other day,
with a man who is competent to sp ea k, and he
said that the Caloola stone is better than the Dago
article. It contains a larger percentage of car-
bonate of magnesia than the latter, and is, there-
fore, better suited to stand the weather, ihe
professor of geology at Melbourne University has
examined the product of the Caloola quarries, and
remarks that it contains small, hard pins°;, d ,,o'
mice. My authority, who has sculped both the
imported and the local variety of stone, says that
the dolomite pins simply mean that the monu-
ment purchaser gets a more durable obelisk for his
money. Carrara marble sells here at 12s. per
cubic foot; Caloola at Bs. The only solid objec-
tion to the Australian stone (which exists m prac-
tically unlimited quantities near Bathurst, IN.b.V\.)
seems to be that it hasn’t been dragged over 10,000
miles of moisture in a ship, and that the rats
haven’t crawled over it.

Brisbane Hospital got into the Philp-
Leahy habit of owing all round to such an extent
that the State Government had to take a hand,
and, after putting matters straight, brought in a
Bill to deal with hospitals. Whereupon an
“influential deputation ” sought to stay proceed-
ings, which Morgan promised to do if the deputa-
tionists paid up the £6OOO owing before October
Ist. This idea of paying up was looked upon as
simply preposterous, but as Kidston can say
“ No,” and mean it, the deputation is feeling m
its pocket, and hoping that something dreadful
will happen to a Government that intends to pay
its way and make others do the same.
That pleasing exhibition of laundry work
and the ironing competition attracted several
hundreds to Melbourne Exhibition Building for
three or four evenings. Chief interest centred in
the ironing by hand, in the presence of an inquisi-
tive public, of a white shirt and a lady s skirt, for
each of which events a score of entries were re-
ceived, including one from a man, Mr. Arthur
Guy—a police constable, no less. r l his bold
launder had also entered an ironed-at-home white
shirt for competition, but apparently the shirt had
been mauled by some drunk he was arresting;
anyhow, neither he nor his garment transpired.
The laundresses didn’t look a robust lot; the
gas or the steam appears to be unhealthy;
without exception they were white-faced, ansenuc,
weak-looking. Also, one or two had the starch-
chewing habit so badly that they couldn t refrain
in public. The rest were either free of it, or only
demolished starch at home.

“Hamer”: Curiosity, the

He read palms, and drank what
drinks he could get. He grasped
my hand, and suggested that I
should give him a small coin, which
I promptly didn’t. Then he told
me that the initials W.S. came
to him. “William Smith” was
the only person they reminded me
of, I told him, at which he seemed
pained, and suggested a small coin.
He told me I had had a mother,
mentioned my age within half-a-
eioz 11 years of tlie truth, and told
me many similar facts as an illus-
tration of his occult power, and
again suggested a small coin. I
shouted drinks, and he warmed up
and told me I would be rich and
famous some day, and again sug-
gested a small coin. I promised to
give it to him when I was rich and
famous, but he didn’t seem to be
attracted by the prospect. He left
me for a while, and another man
informed me he had seen him in
Chow Africa, where he was coining
money as a palmist, which seems to
hint that the country that allows
the importation of Chinamen is
more gullible than this on.*. Tiien
he returned to me and hastened
the time of my good fortune, and
again suggested a small coin. So
many suggestions seemed worth
something, and I gave him a small
coin, and left him promising me

The party of parliamentarians who left
Melbourne the other day to inspect the Waranga
waterworks took with it Mr. Malan, a South

Goulburn weir, over whose brim 2,375,000 gallons
of water are now running to waste every minute ;
then on through the Shepparton, Rushworth, and
Murchison country, where irrigation channels are
almost as plentiful as gutters in a city ; then along
the main channel, as big as a river, from the Goul-
burn to Waranga Basin—the huge lake that,
taking in 1,000,000,000 gallons a day, will take 54

round for the complement thereof, saw only a
casual farmhouse here and there, a few navvies’
huts, a hundred or two sheep, and a few score
cattle. Someone asked him his opinion of the
undertaking. “Very large and good and com-
plete, but—where are all the people for these
lands? The country seems to be a wilderness
And so it is—a howling wilderness of big land-
lords. „ ' .

Some more reflections and reminiscences
about St. Peters-the unkempt Sydney suburb
which recently, aud undeservedly, failed to get
itself re-christened by the foolish name of
“Brompton”: —
St Peters is one of the oldest boroughs in Austral):,,
and its church and cemetery are historic. The church
(St. Peter’s) was built 70 years ago on ground given by
Robert Campbell, the first minister being Thomas Steele,
LL.D. Acting for Dr. Steele for a time was the Reverend
Thomas Makinson, who, ill the late forties, ’verted to
Rome, his place as locum tenens being taken by Rev.
James liassall, who died last year near Bnsbane.
Another in the neighborhood was Rev. Charles C. Kemp,
who married the widow of William Toogood. Toogood
kept the Golden Fleece at the N.E. corner of George and
King streets, in the fifties. Mr. Kemp induced his wife to
refuse to let the house any longer as a pub., and
when Mr. Edward Samuels’ lease was up, the City Bank
started business on the corner. The old cemetery,
adjoining St. Peter’s Church, holds the remains of many
notable colonists-the first wife of Solicitor-General
Manning, James Raymond (Postmaster-General) Judge
Josephson, “Smith of Mulgunma,” Thomas Icely, M.D.0.,
Jolui Bibb (an early architect), Robert Haviland Way,
and Mrs. Wise (widow of tbe late Justice Wise,
and mother of B. R. Wise, K.C.) On the Cooks
River road, in the early days, lived many mem-
bers of the colonial aristocracyA. B. Spark,
Leslie Duguid (first manager of the Commercial Bank),
Dr. Tucker, the Talbots, Kerri son James, Unwin (an old-
time solicitor), and others. When the Government
undertook to convert .the picturesque lagoon lying
between Cook’s River road and Botany Bay into Sheas
Creek, and made it a dumping-ground for city debris, the
“ old families ” gave up the locality as a bad job.
Acting on the advice of Grown Prosecutor
Finlayson, the Bent Cabinet last week decided
that, as no criminal proceedings could possibly
succeed against the awful Victorian butter agents,
those typical “commercial men should still be
allowed to pervade Collins-street as of yore m t
tall hat of respectability and the halo of the
martyr. No wonder the Victorian Chamber of
Commerce protested so strongly against Attorney-
General Isaacs’ Secret Commissions Bill. Under
a sound and honestly-administered scheme like
Isaacs’ Bill, or like that of Lord Russell in
England, there would have been no possibility of
a nolle prosequi being entered against certain butter
agents—the only alternative to acquittal would
have been £5OO fine or two years hard labor, or
both. „ ,
George Fairbairn, Vic. M.L.A., on the
American “expert” :
When he was connected with the meat-trade in Queens-
land the company he was identified with was very anxious
to devefop the canned meat trade. They therefore sent
to America for an instructor, and secured °"* ak
year The report which the manager sent soon after his
arrival was that he was a very nice young man, and
exceedingly anxious to learn the canned meat industry
Others could tell a tale of sending across the world
for “experts” who turned out to be poorly
equipped, and afterwards finding that they had
thoroughly capable men at home. Ihe ‘ strenuous

mainly of strenuous boosting of their own ability,
with very little capacity to back their brag.

Madame Maggie Stirling was officially
welcomed by the gaud Mayor of Melbourne with
much ostentation and showers of melted butter in
the shape of eulogistic platitudes, bhe was also
received by the Mayor and citizens of Camberwell,
her native suburb, with ostentation and more
melted butter. The lady bore it all with becoming
meekness, although the difference between the
attitude of mayors now and the obliviousness ot
mayors when she was only an Australian singer
without the English hall mark could hardly have
escaped her recollection. Mayors were not officially
aware of her existence when she figured in public
merely on the strength of her abilities as an artist,
but it is painfully like mayors to endeavor to add
to tlieir importance by greatly patronising the
singer who has won European recognition.

Queensland has £2,392,701 with which to wean
itself away from the habit of leaning up against the pawn-
shop ; that was the amount of the “cash balance” to
credit of'Loan Fund on June 30. But £1,551,742 of it is
in the Q.N. Bank, and only oozes out at the rate of about
£86,000 per half-year. It is to be hoped that long before
the eight years are over (it will take eight vears for it all
to ooze out) Queensland will be quite cured, and will put
the final payments into the Debt Reduction Fund. So
far that fund doesn’t take up much room in the public
accounts. In Philp’s days, between 1900 and 1904, there
wasn’t a single entry, except a debit—“ Loss on sale of
Government Savings Bank stock, £10.” Philp actually
had the gall to charge that to a fund created expressly
for the reduction of the public debt.

Some Westralian politicians can hardly hold
themselves in when they mention their sinking fund for
the redemption of the State’s debt; it already amounts,
they point out, to about 5 per cent, of the total debt.
But it turns out that two-thirds of the whole lot has been
lent over again to the State. In other words, Westralia
has virtuously put £900,000 or so in the till and said it
would pay its creditors with the money ; and then it has
sneaked back to the till, and taken the money, and built
things that don’t pay with it, and comforted the other-
wise empty till with its own I O U.

In the past 12 months Tasmanian railways didn’t
earn quite half of what they cost the country in interest.
Cohen’s bill was £147,019 ; and after paying' working
expenses there was £73,300 left to meet it with. But
Treasurer Stewart scorns the idea that this meant a loss
of £73,719. “ Consider,” he said, “the immense benefits
to the users of the railways from the cheapened cost of
transit.” If a pickpocket stole Treas. Stewart’s watch, it
wouldn’t be enough for somebody to say to him—“ Con-
sider the immense benefits to the thief through getting
a watch for nothing.” “ Yes,”Stewart would say, “that’s
all very well for the thief; but what about me?” And these
“ immense benefits from the cheapened cost of transit”
are all very well for the people who get them without pay-
ment ; but what about the State that can’t give the
immense benefits without payment ?

While a few Australasian fire insurance co.’s
have made splendid progress in the last 15 years, others
have remained almost stagnant. Take this list, showing-
net premium incomes of a few of them at various periods :
1890. 1900. 1904-5.
New Zealand .. ..£269,893 £315,284 £420,311
South British .. .. 246,487 215,729 284,402
Colonial Mutual .. .. 88,593 95,253 125,161
Mercantile Mutual .. 27,923 37,235 50,534
Australian Mutual .. 27,870 33,888 36’,088
North Queensland _ .. 30,722 75,310 72,230
Victoria 73,413 82,217 82,276
Victoria General .. .. 10,874 11,324 9,443
Australian Alliance .. 41,779 48,574 54,659
Some of the variations are due to changes of policy. Thus
the South British once did a large foreign business which
it couldn’t watch, and the result was just about as
disastrous as might be expected. It got its experience,
paid for it, and drew out; hence the decline in business
between 1890 and 1900. The North Queensland got on to
the same alluring track, and found a loss at the end of it ;
then it drew back—and fortunately in its case it didn’t
have quite so far to draw. But, apart from these special
cases, this one fact stands out above all others : the
offices that have suffered most from dry-rot and stagna-
tion are those that have had the high-dividend disease
worst. The Colonial Mutual, which has made extremely
rapid progress, laid the foundations for that by going
absolutely without dividends for some vears. In 1894, it
had no reserves at all, and before that it had a
huge deficit. The next four years it made £34,404
profit and paid only £4125 in dividends. At the
last balance its shareholders’ funds amounted to
£171,127, including the paid capital of £37,500. The
New Zealand Co. has in six years put aside £196,152,
while its dividends have been £162,500; and as a result
of thus strengthening its reserves its business is simply
leaping ahead, and taking, profits along with it: The
Mercantile Mutual, though it is doing less in the way of
strengthening its position than some others, has neverthe-
less added 33J per cent, to reserves in 10 years ; and the
public’s business has gone that co.’s way to reward it. On
the other hand, take the last three co.’s on the list. The
Victoria 10 years ago paid a dividend of 401 per cent.,
which mopped up £20,221 of the year’s totafprofits of
£'20,741. Following year it made £17,058, and paid away
in dividends £17,974. Year after that (1897) it made
£lB,OlO and paid £17,974. A saner policy has been adopted
lately, though two or three years ago divs. were again
rushed up to 36 per cent.; but the co. has to pay now for
its old follies, and its premium income remains almost
stationary.- The business is going to offices that showed
that shareholders weren’t their only consideration—that
they gave a thought to policy-holders as well. The
Victoria General is. an even worse sinner ; to pay its 15,
20, and 25 per cent. divs. it has actually had to reduce its
reserves by £5500 in 10 years ; and as it never had large
reserves, people who want to buy insurance take the hint
and buy it from somebody else. The Australian Alliance
isn’t the worst of the bad examples ; but it is pretty bad.
It had opportunities which hardly another office in Aus-
tralia had, and it threw them away simply because it
greedily devoured every cent of under-writing profit, and
left the future with all its possibilities in the way of some
vast conflagration, to take care of itself. And the public
isn’t sure that that is the sort of fire insurance co. it
is looking for. The figures prove up to the hilt that the
worst use fire insurance co.’s can make of profits is to pay
large dividends with them ; in no line does the scoffing of
profits as soon as they show up pay worse—in none does
the reserving of a of them pay better.

Every person working at a mine which employs 15 or
more men is required to contribute ; the Act requires the
employer to deduct 4.jd. per week from the workman’s
wages, and the State and the employers are required to
pay into the fund, another 4Jd. between them in equal
amounts. The claims are made up of weekly payments
(125.) in cases of disablement, a pension of Bs. per week to
widow or other dependent of a miner killed by accident,
2s. 6d. per week to each child, and a grant of £l2 to bury
the miner when he is killed. The expense rate, though ''’
much higher than it used to be, is still lov-, auiounting to
only £2 7s. sd, per cent, of total income. But In'oom-
paring this with the 8 or 12 per cent, absorbed by the
ordinary insurance office, it has to be remembered that
no medical examination expenses have to be paid, and no
canvassing done for business, while the employers do the
whole of the collecting-. The local committees (which see
to the distribution of the relief) get a small allow-
ance; but the central board" of management,
consisting of representatives of mineowners and
miners, takes no fees, as a rule. In all, only £43 has
from first to last been swallowed by this board. The
fund, moreover, receives office, clerical, and actuarial
accommodation free of charge. Granted that it is a most
excellent institution, there is no reason why, in its rela-
tions with the State, it should not be put upon a purely
business footing. These leakages, through indirect and
hidden subsidies, run away with tens of thousands of
pounds a year. The State should charge for any services
it renders this and every other branch. Then, if the
State thinks it can afford it, the direct subsidy-could be
increased. The public would then know where it was.
As the result of constant clamor, the Govern-
ment lately instructed its actuary to make the first quin-
quennial investigation of the fund. The object was to get
higher benefits. The Act said that an investigation
should be made every five years ; but this one was rushed
on within a little over four years. The report recom-
mended that the benefits should be increased 25 pc: cent,
in most cases, 20 per cent, in others. The actuary valued
the liabilities under the old rates at £85,341, and under
the new rates at £106,048 ; the latter would give a surplus
of £14,060 as at 30th April. Valuations of liabilities
under accident policies are, however, extremely unreli-
able (on account of the want of data), and the reduction of
the surplus to this small amount looks very risky.
Note, as to that, the steady growth in the total amount
of claims. Consider also the growth in other respects :

1904 .. 170-76 .. 2 11 4
Yet the actuary argues that the tendency is for accidents
to become less. It may be ; but the tendency of men to
go on the fund, instead of risking their jobs by working
when unfit, is obviously greater. And again, as to relief
granted per 1000 contributors

The increase in the benefits has, nevertheless, been agreed
upon. Well, the only thing to hope for is that, after a
few years, a lot of disappointment won’t have to be
caused by hauling the benefits down again.

The Australian Alliance Assurance Co.
(Melbourne), which has at various times added £75,000 of
profits to its original paid capital of £50,000 (in the follow-
ing- the dividend is shown on the £50,000 actually sub-
scribed) :

But this takes no account of the judgment for £113,082
given against the co., this judgment having been
appealed against, nor of the costs of the proceedings. The
smaller profits as compared with 1904 result from heavier
fire losses. These absorbed 54 5 per cent, of net pre-
miums, as against 39'1 per cent, in 1904, and 45 per cent,
in 1903. The marine loss rate was 68'5 per cent, of net
premiums. The expense rate in the fire department was !
37 per cent, of net premiums; in the marine, 23'3 per
cent. Thus, in spite of the unusually heavy fire-loss rate,
8-5 per cent, of net premiums in that branch were profit;
while, notwithstanding a favorable marine experience,
only 8.2 per cent, of those premiums were profit. In 1904
the surpluses were—fire, 26 per cent. ; marine 7"7 per
cent. Though there are stray years in which marine
business gives thumping profits (in 1900 this co. netted
40-2 per cent, of its marine premiums), the experience
generally is unsatisfactory. Anyway, there is not the
money in it that there is in fire insurance.
The Australian Alliance has made no progress
to be proud of. Bringing together the figures for the fire
and marine branches, these results are arrived at:—
Net Ex- Loss Expense
Premiums. Losses. penses. Rate. Rate.
1890.. £41,779 £25,754 £11,907 61’7 28-6

1905.. 54,659 33,383 16,921 611 31-0
Business was dislocated in 1895, after the bursting of
the boom, and the figures for that period hardly count.
For the last five-year period most of the figures might
have been better ; and for the whole 15-year period they
show less improvement than might have been expected
in some directions and none at all in others —in the matter
of expenses, for instance. In 15 years the co. has only
increased its net premium income by 32 per cent.
In the life department, the Australian Alliance
is now doing no new business. Its record for 10 years is
as follows :

The recent law proceedings, if they end in a compromise,
will no dpubt take something from the other branches
and add it to the assurance fund. The securities of the
two are apparently held in common, or at any rate are
not shown separately, so that there will probably be no
loss through forced realisation. On the average assets of
the whole concern the interest earnings show £3 4s. lCd.
per cent.; but the assurance fund is credited with interest
at the rate of £3 18s. 4d. per cent. The assets are for the
most part in at book values ; and the , size of the'whole
return suggests that book values are rather above market
values. Assets include “ Law costs suspense, £5369.”

They are trying hard in Melbourne to patch up
the Australian Alliance Assurance Co.’s troubles. Chief
Justice Madden’s verdict against the co. (brought on
behalf of policy-holders in the old life department) was
for £113,082 and the costs of one of the most expensive
cases ever heard in Victoria ; co.’s capital and reserves
amount to £224,657. The policy-holders are mostly old,
and not particularly enthusiastic, and it has taken a lot of
hustling to carry the struggle this far ; so both sides look
kindly on proposals for a compromise. The matter comes
up at a special meeting of the co. on Oct. 12.

The bonus is 6d. in the £ on purchases ; and that and the
dividend are far more than the society can afford. To
pay it the fund which was being built up to wipe out the
preliminary expenses has to be reduced. The position is
dha-t after two-years’ trading (and it is assumed that it has
been successful'trading), the society still owes share-
holders some of the money spent in floating the concern.
Meantime, the society is drifting deeply into debt.
Eighteen months ago it owed the public, over and above
its resources in cash, “sundry debtors,” and similar
assets, £9159 ; six months ago that total had reached
£12,717 ; now-it is up to £14,380. Certainly all this is
supposed 'to be represented by stock, vacant land, pre-
mises, fittings, &c. ; but any depreciation in the value of
those things will fall wholly- on shareholders. It is too
rapid a rush into debt. The society was formed, on a
co-operative basis, to make the members their own mas-
ters and put them outside the money-power; and it forth-
with throws itself into the arms of the money-power, and
pledges itself to support the money-lender. There, is
a more satisfactory side to the business. The turnover
continues to grow. Receipts have been £42,866, against
£36,364 for the corresponding half of 1904—remarkable
figures for an infant. But if members won’t buy unless
they get their bonus, if they won’t help to build up the
society by leaving a bonus in abeyance for a while, then
the society would probably be better without them.
Then it wouldn’t be so much inclined to rush out and buy
a motor car—it would put up with a wheelbarrow for a
year or two.

This is run on much the same lines as the Adelaide Co-
operative Society, one of the oldest in Australasia, except
that the latter allows withdrawals of capital at any time,
and the surplus profits are left on deposit, carry-
ing 4 per cent., while in the Tasmanian society
the surplus is represented by bonus shares, which
hitherto have carried 6 per cent. No attempt is made
to build up a formal reserve fund. What appears above
as a reserve'fund is a suspense item, but as it consists
largely of premiums, and is, therefore, to that extent a
reserve, it has been assumed that it is wholly a reserve.
If it is a reserve it should not be called a suspense account,
and if part of it is one sort of thing and part of it another,
the two shouldn’t be lumped in this way. Apparently, it
is called a suspense account because it is thought that a
true co-operative concern shouldn’t have any reserves;
there is a lurking suspicion to that effect in the Adelaide
concern and some others as well. Why it should be so
passes comprehension. A reserve fund is just as neces-
sary to guard against disaster, and therefore just as
necessary in the interests of present shareholders,
as an audit is, or a lock on the door, or
a coat of paint on the premises. Most co-opera-
tive societies know they can’t get along without
a reserve, and the struggle to invent some other
name for it is half humorous and half pitiable. And
if this particular society doesn’t look out, in spite of
its very fine progress the struggle to pay 6 per cent, on a
capital which is being continually watered will land it in
trouble. True, the increases of capital are represented
by balances of profit, but that profit may be in the shape
of “ sundry debtors,” and earning nothing. In four
years the overdraft, etc. (now £1900) has been more than
doubled, and that doesn’t look healthy, for one thing.

The co. originally paid £3500 for the goodwill of a small
medical benefit society, and £lOOO of this still remains in
its balance-sheet as an asset; this being purely a paper
item it is disregarded in the foregoing table. The actual
additions to assurance fund are less than they were in the
previous two years :
Additions to Funds.

1898 851 1901 805 1904 1463
1899 1173 1902 1010 1905 1408
But the bulk of the business is under medical benefit and
similar tables, and it is probable that some at least of
these risks require no large reserves. In the valuation
made at the end of 1904 no liability was reckoned as
accruing under these tables ; and, though any office doing
this sort of business is liable to be struck with an abnor-
mal number of claims in any year, the fact that claims
in the aggregate remain steady gives some support to
the practice of the office. Compared with the size of the
claims, the size of the reserves is therefore not so absurd
as it looks. The unsatisfactory part of the business is
that the funds accumulated in connection with the
regular life assurance, as to which reliable valuations of
liability can be made, are lumped with the funds in
connection with a vast number of fancy tables, as to
which no reliable valuation of liabilities can be made.
Also, this lumping of things makes it impossible to tell
what the ordinary insurer is paying for his insurance.
The lumped expenses have been

This is a ridiculous rate to pay for any sort of insurance—
even the sick-benefit sort. The ordinary benefit society,
which isn’t generally reckoned a model of business organ-
isation, does very much the same sort of business as what
is probably the most expensive class of this company’s
business, and does it for 20 to 25 per cent, of total
income. The 1903 report of the Oddfellows (Independent
Order, N.S.W.) showed a total expense rate of a shade over
21 per cent., which was said- to be above the average.
Either, then, this co. is only doing this friendly-society
class of business at an enormously greater cost than
mutual friendly societies do it for, or the regular insurance
business is costing enormously more than the mutual
office can do it for. Probably the cost is absurdly great
in both cases—which is another poor advt. for private
enterprise as compared with co-operation, either through
the State or through mutual societies.

The insurance account has to cover £432,536 worth of
steamers, lighters, plant, &c. Excellent speed has been
made in building up this reserve. An unknown amount
is written off for depreciation ; the repairs and renewals
reserve is therefore something more than a book-keeping
entry against depreciation which has actually occurred,
though to what extent it is better than that it is impos-
sible to say. Twelve months ago floating assets repre-
sented £503,288. They are now down t0’£432,537, a re-
duction of £70,751; there have evidently, then, been
heavy writings-off: during the year, in addition ’to the
£20,000 or so added to repairs and renewal fund. The
amounts evidently-written off, as well as the additions to
formal reserves, are represented by large increases in
“ freehold properties, wharves,, and shares in other co.’s ”
(£104,103 to £189,655) and “sundry debtors, agents
balances, bills receivable, &c.” (£52,249 to £118"895).
Allowing that the co. is in a fairly hazardous business,'
and that wear and tear is tolerably heavy, still the
impression these accounts leave is that it is doing- remark-
ably well, and that if it wanted to it could easily issue a
much more alluring balance-sheet.

That 14 p.c. dividend looked a fixture (it had been paid
regularly since 1894), but electricity has made a difference.
Ten months ago the co. brought down its price for gas to
6s. lOd. per 1000 ft. ; now it has reduced the price of gas
for power to ss. per 1000 ft. The co. has been writing
off for wear and tear an average of about £lBOO per
annum, equal to about 2 per cent, on book-value ; more-
over, apart from funds invested in the undertaking, it
has £15,565 on deposit. The reserves are therefore a
good deal more real than those of most gas co. ’s. And.
even at the reduced rate of profit, they are still earning
good money; on shareholders’ total funds (capital and
reserves) the past year’s profits work out at just about
7 per cent. Reduction from 14 to 12 per cent, is no
doubt very sad ; but the co. should take heart—there
are quite a lot of people whose money isn’t earning them
7 per cent.

The co.’s capital (£25,000) is a small thing compared with
the mortgages (£125,000) on its property. Last year £2500
was put aside to reduce this huge load, but, in spite of
the yarn that legislation is driving capital out of the
country, that particular Oohen declined to accept the
proffered money. So far from waiting for a chance to get
out, he pointed to the bond and insisted upon staying.
The co. therefore has to go on paying interest on the old
£125,000, though it has £7500 out on deposit, besides
(previous to paying the dividend) £3661 on current
account. The trade revenue for the year was £56,680 as
against £62,423 the previous year, which explains the
decline in net profits, notwithstanding that only £1604
was spent in repairs and renewals as against £2148 in
1904. The shareholders’ funds (capital and reserves)
earned £9 14s. per cent. ; that is to say, rather less than
the earnings of the reserves were put to reserve.

The co. is too busy shifting its mortgage, which still
stands at £54,025, to think of .a dividend ; £llOO has been
paid off during the year. Ten years ago the liability stood
at £68,000, and five years ago at £59,000. But things
might be worse. Apparently the money is only costing
per cent. Yet a co. that can get accommodation at
that rate, and still shows up as poorly as this one is doing,
must be having a pretty cold time. Outside its mortgage,
the co.’s liabilities are £2505 ; its liquid assets, £2514.

This co. doesn’t tread the ordinary paths of profit. Its
business is mainly to keep up the price of beef and mut-
ton ; it gives more than a beast is worth, for the encourage-
ment of the others, and grateful pastoralists subsidise it
for its services. Their own profit comes in the higher
prices that the other buyers are obliged to give ; and as
this co. is practically the pastoralists themselves, they
can afford to go without direct dividends from it. It all
seems somehow an interference with the “ natural law of
supply and demand,” which pastoralists are sometimes
great sticklers for. But, with large resources, it does
some good work for Australia by sending out only high-
class potted goods, &c., and spending money in impressing
on the foreign buyer that Australian goods are good
goods.

The reserves shown include a provision for interest on
debentures falling due in July of each year. The co.’s
paid capital is £111,225, and £50,000 has been raised on
debentures. Liabilities to the public, apart from deben-
tures and bills covering London shipments, have been re-
duced from £58,340 in 1902 to £46,399 ; undivided profits
(all reserves are used in the business) have been applied to
this purpose. The assets include freeholds, £59,294;
stock-in-trade (valuation), £91,355 ; plant, £51,217 ; and
sundry debtors, £47,648. The last item stands just about
where it stood in 1902 ; in 1903 and 1904 it was reduced
by about £5OOO. Excellent progress appears latterly to
have been made, both in the matter of profits and reduc-
tion of debt; though where so much of the assets is re-
presented by stock (and to some extent sundry debtors),
a very great deal has to be taken on trust.

The new electric light installation of the Mel-
bourne Exhibition Cycle Track, formed a great attraction
of the recent “Austral” meeting. The main feature of
the system is the “Ganz” brilliant arc lamp, forty of
which are distributed round the track, suspended on iron
brackets. The light is absolutely steady, soft and
diffused, doing away entirely with the injurious glare
common with other lamps and overcoming the objection-
able shadows in and under the globe. Special globes are
used which, while diffusing the light, do not cut off an
undue quantity and the effect is a light known
scientifically to be the best for all illuminating purposes.
The candle power is more than four times that furnished
by other lamps at the same current consumption. Electric
lighting by the “Ganz” arc lamp is cheaper than any
other form of illuminant, both in first cost, in fixing and
in maintenance. The contractors for this installation
were the Austral Otis Engineering Co., Ltd., corner
Hannah and Kavanagh streets, South Melbourne, Sole
Agents for Ganz and Co., Budapest, Hungary, who will
gladly furnish estimates and expert advice upon similar

“ Janor” : General belief among miners is that
wolfram deposits occur only in granite country ; yet there
is a creek in Gippsland (Vic.) in which waterworn wolfram
is obtained, in association with alluvial gold. Watershed
is entirely composed of sedimentary rocks (silurian).
Creek drifts show no sign of granite, as they probably
would had some pre-existent granite belt been entirely
denuded on the catchment area. Looks as if the mineral
will yet be found in other than granite country.

assessment of 4s. a share. Of this amount Is. is payable
on application, Is. on allotment, and the balance in calls
of Is. at intervals of three months. From Jan. to
June the co. worked at a loss of £l2OO, which looks
bad enough ; but, during July, loss was £4OO, and during
August it was £5OO, which is worse. Ore has dropped
back to about sdwt., which is quite unpayable. Concern
looks a most hopeless proposition at present, and its past
history is hardly reassuring. Some five years ago a
highly payable lode was reported as having been cut by a
diamond drill bore, but all efforts to locate it have since
proved fruitless. Query is, where did the core come from ?

South Kalgurli (W.A.) is highly promising at
present. It is equipped with two No. 8 Krupp mills and
a No. sas a stand-by. The two No. B’s have been treating
100 tons a day each, and during August handled 6200 tons
for a net profit, barring London exes., of £6OOO. Manager
Morgan reckons that this rate can be maintained, as co.
has two years’ reserves in sight, and the No. 5 mill can be
utilised during any stoppage to maintain output. Ex-
traction is good (93 '6 per cent.), and total costs come out
at 265. lOd. per ton. As co. is in only 200,000 shares,
August rate of profit will allow of divs. of 25 per cent.
• * * *
Lancefield (W.A.) is not coming up to expecta-
tions, and it is said the refractory nature of the ore is
responsible. During August extraction was only 19s. Bd.
Ser ton ; costs, 215." lOd. ; loss, 2s. 2d. per ton, or £7OO.
[anager Simpson, of L.V. Consols, admittedly one of the
best metallurgists in W.A., has been put in charge to see
if he can lay his hand on the weak spot.

Norseman (W.A.) is suffering from the peri-
odical water famine. Princess Royal has been obliged to
sack 30 men and Cumberland a less number, because the
dam has given out, and there is not enough fresh water
for boilers. The rainfall is quite sufficient had dams been
sunk to catch it, and through neglect workers and share-
holders have to suffer serious loss. Princess Royal is dis-
carding No. 1 battery, an old ramshackle affair, for a new
plant, and No. 2 will be remodelled. A second rock-
breaker is also being installed. This will increase output
and cheapen costs, which hitherto have panned out at the
ridiculous figure of 555. a ton.
* * # *
Cumberland, Norseman (W.A.), doesn’t seem
to have improved since manager Fernald displaced mana-
ger Burkett. The fact is, reef is far too small and patchy
for a big co., and mine is only suitable for working
parties. Tom Hewitson’s friends, who bought in last
year at and over 10s. per share, must be having an anxious
time.

That matter of the rush of mining-law experts
and others to the place where silver chlorides were found
near Orange (N.S.W.) seems to have been quietly dropped.
The story is that the stuff was sent down to the Mines
Department with the request that the prospectors might
be told what it was made of; and that, before word
reached the prospectors, “fly’’people in Sydney either
knew or got a suspicion that the stuff was rich, and rushed
the neighborhood. Did the Department leak ? Presumably
Minister Moore will probe the circumstances. The pro-
spector gets enough discouragement without having to
hump the suspicion that the nearer you stick to the Mines
offices the closer you are to the reef.

Two hundred thousand tons of B. H. Block 14
“tailings” containing much zinc have gone the way of
the rest. The crowd that has laid its paw on all these
Barrier dumps evidently has the control of the spelter
market in its eye—or it may be the same Continental
crowd that has had the biggest say in that market for
years. The money (£5OOO deposit has been paid) will
come in very handy to Block 14. The way that co. has
been able to pick itself up out of the dirt, and get new
equipment, without going to the shareholders’ pockets, is
about the most striking thing in recent Barrier company
management. What it was and what it is about repre-
sents the difference between Adelaide and Melbourne
control.

Judging by the daily-paper reports, all the
trouble at the Sulphide Corporation, Broken Hill, is over
—as, when the creep occurred, they said it would be by
the beginning of September. Well, for the last four
weeks before the smash the mill averaged 5250 tons of
crudes per week ; present run is barely 2000 tons. And
this is after nine weeks. Estimate made here, that it
would be well towards the end of the year before things
become normal, looks like being realised.

British (Broken Hill) mine is rushing things.
To work the almost-untouched northern end an arrange-
ment has been made with the Junction for the use of
MTntyre’s shaft. There is ore in this block almost from
the surface down, including a good deal of oxidised ; but it
is very poor in silver. British has, next to the B.H.
Prop., the largest area of lode country ; but its bodies are
irregular, and much of its sulphides are heavy in rhodon-
ite, the stuff that causes all the trouble at the neighboring
Junction North. Also it owns some of the hottest work-
ings at Broken Hill, and that doesn’t help to keep costs
low. It has to carry 300,000 shares (including 60,000
privileged), and has never been able to be anything but a
very irregular div.-payer, and, in spite of a rather more
cheerful outlook, is still not likely to sail into a front
place and stay there.

Crowl Creek (N.S.W.) still fails to grip the
public. For one thing, the public sniffs at the fact that
something good nearly always turns up just before the
half-yearly meeting. Twelve months ago it was the lode
at 430 ft. ; this time it is an ore-body at 530 ft.—not the
main lode, they say, but anoiher. Still, profits are better
than they were six months ago—£ll,ols against £7858.
But in the half-year before,! that working account showed
£12,547 to the good ;so progress isn’t conspicuous. Two
divs. (total £10,500) were/paid in the six months ; but co.
ends the year with a sma'u overdraft, though on the other
side it estimates it has £9OOO worth of copper on hand or
in balances due. Costa, which had gone up to £30125.
per ton of rough copa e r previous half-year, are now
£32 11s. 9d. ; this includes development. Nothing in the
way of an estimate of i ore reserves is forthcoming ; all
that manager Armstrotfo- binds himself to is that a winze
was sunk 24ft. below\ 430 ft. level “in solid sulphides,
equal in value to the V> re above, and the ore underfoot
along the floor of the 435jft. level was very solid and com-
pact.” The co. is still lining to a great extent from hand
to mouth, and when thejt hear of the striking of a good
main lode at 530 ft. shareholders should feel considerably
relieved. S

“M.C.” : Be the suggestion (8., Sept. 12) that
an export duty might encouiWge Australia to use up its
own dirt instead of exporting it for the benefit of
Germany and Belgium. The' people who blow so en-
thusiastically about Australians mineral output (about
£25,000,000 a year), and turn tl heir blind eye to the huge
quantity of it that goes out in its crudest form, ought to
look up the Broken Hill Propv.’s figures. There they
would see what the treatment of tAus crude stuff means
to the country that has it to do. To,reduce its 140,572
tons ore, matte, etc., the B.H. Prop, last half-year called
for 149,128 tons of other products, including 44,910 tons
ironstone, 24,880 tons limestone, 38,540't0ns coke, 42,251
tons of slag, and 42 tons scrap iron.
True Blue, Wyalong (N.S.W.), from a windlass
beginning', is now about to include in its appointments
rock drills and electricity for lighting purposes. All
brought about by the judicious handling of the wealth
within its four corners. As expected, Naylor’s application
for the Mousetrap lease has been granted, and the lesson
for some people to learn is to keep a good thing when
they have got it by observing labor covenants. Latest
Wyalong crushings of note —Union, 19 tons for 690 z;
Phillips and party, 80 tons for S6oz.
The wail of Chairman Waldron, of the Hercules,
Mt. Read (Tas.), because the miners would not submit to
the wage-reduction the co. wanted to force on them, is
full of holes. The Board wanted the men to submit to
lose £llOO a year as part of “ a scheme of economy pro-
posed to be introduced with a view to endeavoring to
bring the co. into a regular dividend-paying concern.”
Result of refusal was that mine has been shut down for
over six months. At the ver3’ time the Board wanted
this reduction the co. had profits accrued or accruing
amounting to £13,000; it had the prospect of the best
metal market ahead that has ruled for nine years ; and it
had the chance of striking ore in the No. 6 tunnel. To
close the mine has meant pretty well £5OO in depre-
ciation ; but that is nothing when compared with the loss
of prestige to the co. from being badly beaten by the men,
and the absolute cash drift through missing the high
prices for metals. Not content with drivelling about the
check to the inflow of capital caused by “ the power of
the labor organisations and agitators,” the Board sneers
at the outlook for Broken Hill co.s’ disposing of their zinc
residues ; and, as quite 1,500,000 tons of tailings have just
been sold straight out by Barrier co.’s, that gibe is as
foolish as the others.

Tasmanians like waiting, and are languidly
watching developments on Gladstone dredge, success or
otherwise of which will have much influence on Tas. tin
ventures generally. There is no reason why latter should
be so ; for if the show paps out well it will not make
others do likewise. As to mine itself, there are only bor-
ing tests to depend upon. Taking these as correct, the
future of mine rests upon the plant itself, which is now in
working order and treating estimated quantities of drift.
There is nothing new in main portion of works; the
special features are the tin-saving appliances and the
boxes themselves, which are used elsewhere, but only for
gold. Trommels seem to work well, classification being
apparently perfect, but several alterations to boxes
will have to be made. Though general opinion is
otherwise, there should be no difficulty in remov-
ing buried timber, as the purchase on the “ lad-
der,” round which the buckets work, will lift
20 tons or more, exclusive of its own weight
(30 tons). This, with an additional lift of 10 tons
with the crane, should remove most trees after drifts
have been shifted by the buckets working under and over
them. The paddock in which dredge was built is worked
out; stated that 60 tons of tin and 150 oz. of gold came
from it (one acre). Under old methods this took 21 months
to work ; present plant should shift same quantity in
eight weeks. Dredge-master Ryan, a practical man, says
it will take about three weeks or less to work out into
paying drifts. Writer has to take office statements as to
vaiue of mine, but believes, as far as dredge is concerned,
it will be a success.

The first of the Melbourne-owned Tasmanian
tin mines to come on the dividend list was the New Ruby
Flat. Now follows the New Brothers Home No. 1. This,
though an independent co., has let its mine on a
tribute agreement to the Briseis Co., by which that
concern works it and hands over 48 per cent, of the
value of the output of tin won from drift. Salvation
came with this agreement,.and there seems to be every
chance of divs. flowing steadily, as the worst of the over-
burden—for the removal of which the co. pays—is off,
leaving the drift to cost the co. nothing. Mine has been
at work for years, but since the time when it was Laun-
ceston-owned, when the tin drift was mined by drives, it
has never paid. The problem is how much tin was
excavated then and what the dirt left will average.
Montgomery, ex-Tas. Govt. Geologist, estimated about
101 b. to the cubic yard, and J. B. Mackenzie about 2j-lb.
So far, enough work has not been done to prove which
expert is right. To put it at 51b. might seem a safe esti-
mate, seeing that the Briseis dirt pans out about that.
Doubt about the claim arose from the cold shoulder
turned on the property months ago by the Argus mining
man. Results show that he would have been better
advised if he had been more generous in this direction,
and had used gall when dealing with certain other tin
shows, which deserve slating as much to-day as they did
then.

Under the new order, each department of Chilla-
goe 00. (N.Q.) will be worked by its own head. With
Back in charge of the railway, which is by far the most
profitable part of the business—the only profitable part,
in fact —and Greenway as general manager, the pot was
often at the boil. Now Paul Kunze will take up the
metallurgical work, Brander the mining, and Back will
have all the glory of the railway profits. As to those
latter, some people profess to begin to smell rats. Their
idea is that the railway is going to be boomed, and the
profits bloated, until some day soon the State will be
asked why it doesn’t take over such an extremely payable
undertaking.

J. Horsburg, lately appointed manager of Mt.
Molloy, one of the two Queensland copper shows that
look like making money for their owners, is a young
Queenslander. First he got into the Aldershot works
(Q.), under Wynberg; a three-years course at Sydney
Engineering School followed; lately he has been under
Greenway, at Chillagoe. Greenway is a good metallur-
gist to be under, provided you don’t catch his craving for
piling up machinery. He, more than any other man, is
responsible for the present system of sulphide treatment
at Broken Hill. It is something of a coincidence that he
and John Warren, the first men to run sulphide mills and
show there was money in them, are each now without a
mine.

Present traction-engine experiment for haulage
of matte, ore, &e., in N.Q., isn’t turning out any better
than its predecessors ; G. H. Blakemore, years ago, tried

as he had had with the teams. Next invasion of N.Q.
will be by mules.

On Mills’ United’s improvement, chances of
East Murchison, New Brill. Freehold, and School Reserve
(Charters Towers) brightened. But the local market dis-
counted the improvement up to the hilt. East Mexican
paids were 2s. in Feb. ; now 11s. 9d. New Brilliant Free-
holds have quadrupled, and School Reserves trebled in
six months. There isn’t a mining Exchange in Australia
that picks its bones cleaner than the Towers’ crowd.

Victoria Quartz, Bendigo, chasing the New
Chum Railway downwards in the search for gold, has got
on to the metal at 4105 ft. New Chum Railway got .its
gold at 4224 ft.; but the Victoria is only on the top
of the formation yet, so it will not be far short of
the Railway in the depth of its working. George
Lansell is a big holder in the Victoria, and his 180 mine
is next door. Should the Victoria turn out trumps,
the veteran reefer will have every reason to congratulate
himself on his year’s work. First, the Virginia has got
well on the way to being the leading mine in Bendigo ;
then the Catherine Reef struck its good stone, and now
the Victoria outlook seems to be more than cheery. The
best of it, too, is that Lansell gets his reward not because
of luck, but through sheer, downright grit, and without
any market shuffling such as has brought discredit on so
many Ballarat mines.

“ It is unnecessary to furnish an array of figures
to prove that economy is the watchword of your direc-
tors.” Thus John Leishman, chairman of directors of the
Birthday mine, Berringa (Vic.), gives a slap in the face to
those managements which, every six months, putfigures be-
fore shareholders in such a way that the novice can tell ho w
the money goes. How one so long in mining can cling to
habits and ways of the old school of directors as does
John Leishman is bewildering to his best friends. To
keep investors posted is the watchword everywhere, and
most men who do not do this are quietly shunted.
Apart from this question, the outlook at the
Birthday is none too rosy. The No. 9 level has been
disappointing throughout, and there isn’t too much good
stone left above the No. 8 to beat out, so that the future
now depends on whether good stone can be picked up at
No. 10, or whether parallel lodes, carrying payable dirt,
can be struck. The poorness of the quartz being milled is
shown by the fact that 13,000 tons, crushed last half-year,
only av eraged 3|dwt., and if there had not been some of
the sdwt. dirt to call on results might have been less.
Yet the Board, although, a. Jot of development work is
wanted, and the fljrOspeotppf.the stone improving is pro-
blematical, declares a ffiW of 6d., leaving about £lOOO to
come and go on. Truly Ballarat people love the divs.
A Vic. mining prospectus, issued the other day,
was backed by reports from the local storekeeper, the
proprietor of the local paper, the town clerk, the
mayor, and the local tailor. If only the local
parson had made a few remarks, and the local black-
smith had thrown his weight into the scale, what
more could an investing public desire—unless it might be
the opinion of the butcher'?

The papers lately printed large masses of tele-
gram and comment on the alleged failure of the State
collieries in M.L. ; but they seem somehow to have missed
the item that the “failures ” paid 8 p.c. in the past year
on their full debenture capital, after making a liberal
allowance for depreciation. The net profit was £11,242 ;
Port Elizabeth showed a profit of £17,335 and Seddon-
ville a loss of £6093.

After all his talk of smashing the Melbourne
Brick Combine, after buying enough land for a dozen
brickyards and after getting machinery built and
despatched to the locality of his proposed State brick-
yard that curiously Bent person, at present Premier of
Victoria, last week practically admitted he had been
bluffing, threw in his hand, and let the combine scoop the
pool. Briefly, Bent agrees to buy all the bricks the State
may require up to Sept. 30th, 1906—t0 be not less than
4,056,000—fr0m the combine at 355. per 1000 on trucks,
instead of at 40s. as previously asked, and the combine
agrees to supply the same at that figure and also to
reduce the price to the public generally to 38s. per
1000 for the same period. It is significant that M.L. A.
McCutcheon, the heaviest Tory and anti-Socialist in
the Victorian Assembly, “assisted” Bent in his negotia-
tions with the combine—and that is the result. It is but
a few months since Thomas boasted he could get all the
bricks he wanted at 225. or 235. ; since then a struggling
competitor of the combine offered to supply the four
millions required for the central station at 275. 6d. ; and
the very fact that the combine “ sprang ” ss. to him and
2s. to the general public at the mere threat of business-
like opposition should have indicated to Bent the extent
to which the State was being bled. But no. The chief
apostle of private enterprise, Tory M‘Cutcheon, “ assisted
in the arrangement,” and the chance of breaking up a
greedy monopolistic concern slips through the Bent
fingers. As to any reason why the State should not make
the bricks for its own railway station, just as it makes
the carriages and engines—well, Bent isn’t the man to
try and answer that question.

Superintendent Sawers, the Bank of Austral-
asia’s chief officer, retires, and C. R. Cowper, long
marked out for the post, succeeds him. The execu-
tive officers of the “ Asia ” have more responsibility than
those of most banks, for it hasn’t such a thing as a director
in Australia. While Sawers has been chief, the concern,
whose worst feature is that it is mostly foreign and sends
its dividends out of the country that earns them, has
made remarkable progress ; in 10 years the dividend has
jumped from 6 per cent, to 12 per cent., and the reserves
from £809,641 to £1,206,951, and all the time it has been
writing down securities out of profits so hard that
premises, for instance, now stand at only £306,527.
Most of the explanation is that when nearly all the other
banks were losing their heads in the ’eighties, the Bank
of Australasia had for its superintendent the late E. S.
Parkes, who sat glued to his chair like an iceberg, and, in
those giddy, drunken days, was reckoned a glum,
unpleasant person who was missing the ’bus. No great
number of people knew the man, and when he died, and
left Sawers to continue his policy (the national drunk
hadn’t quite ended), it wasn’t reckoned, even among
financial men, that Australia was losing probably the
greatest banker that Victoria, if not Australia, ever had.
But when they compare the bogus profits that the
“great ” bankers of those days made, with the real profits
that Parkes’ concern has made since, they begin to realise
the far-sightedness of the glum man who was supposed to
be missing the vehicle.
Unusual item from Sydney Telegraph’s
•‘Country News”:—“Muswellbrook, Thursday. The
business of the municipal gas-works having lately been
progressing satisfactorily, the council has been able to
establish a sinking fund for the purpose of eventually
liquidating the loan raised for the construction of the
works, which constitute the only liability upon the
municipality.” For any Australian borough to be
practically free of debt is remarkable enough ; for it to be
in a violent hurry to get rid of its little Cohen is astonish-
ing ; but for any body of aldermen in this great loan land
to do these things as a mere matter of common honesty
and sound business is simply stupendous. It might
pay N.S.W. to close Parliament altogether and get these
Muswellbrook aldermen to run things for a while.

A, sad story. was told to a few “primary pro-
ducers ” in Melbourne, during show week, in the directors’
annual report to shareholders of the Co-operative Fruit-
growers’ Co. Briefly, the growers had expected the
undertaking to pay from the jump—and, of course, it
didn’t. Calls were unpaid and the eternal bank overdraft
ate up in interest all that could be collected. The chief
object of the co.—jam-making—had been progressing all
right, but the growers would not stand by their own con-
cern and support it till it got a name and a sale ; instead,
they yielded to the blandishments of private jam-makers,
and for the Id. or 2d. extra they got for their cases last
year, they will payback 3d. or 4d., now that their own
concern has ceased to compete. So the co. drops jam-
making and merely continues to act as agent (mostly ex-
port) ; and a co-operative concern which included 60 per
cent, of the orchardists round Melbourne, and which, in
10 years, could have had the whole fruit trade in its
hands, drops that promising future.
A war is going, on in Bananaland. Private
Enterprise is straining every nerve to smash the co-
operative company which controls a large share of the
export of butter. Prices, as a result, are now being paid
for cream which will mean a loss unless the butter realises
110 s. per cwt. on the London market, and no Australian
produce has yet reached that mark. Private Enterprise
has got one splendid weapon at work ; it is seeing reli-
giously that not a box of bad stuff goes to the Cold Coun-
try ; while the farmers, generally a weak crowd when
trying to co-operate, are frequently reminded by the
Government graders that some of their stuff is not fit to
carry the State brand. If compulsory grading did not
exist in Q. just now, the co-operators would have a sorry
chance in this fight.

Another alleged swindle is having attention.
Hitherto, when taking delivery of coal, it has been usual
to accept what is known as the “pit certificate” from
Newcastle. The coal comes from the mines in trucks,
carefully weighed at the pit’s mouth, and the mining
people are paid on that weight. The coal is then tipped
straight into the collier, and on arrival, say, at Sydney,
the purchaser accepts delivery on the figures of the pit
certificate, a time-saving arrangement, as it is not always
convenient to weigh the cargo again. A recent consign-
ment did not go so far as it should have done, and the
quantity of the coal was complained of. The indignant
coal-mine owner made inquiries, and it was then alleged
that all sorts of devices were employed by some colliers to
• hide the coal intended to be delivered. Seeing a clean-
swept hold, a delivery note on the pit certificate would be
given, when (part of the consignment being hidden)
the quantity received would be short of what the re-
ceiver was entitled to.

Since Collie coal was invented in Westralia no
Government has had any peace. Bigjohn boomed it, and
several Bull co.’s were induced to take up country under
mineral leases and place the alleged coal on the market.
The Railway Department was ordered to give the local
product a show, and engine-drivers were compelled to use
it, but they called loudly for something that would let
them observe running time. Two tons of Newcastle coal,
they said, were equal to three of Collie, besides being
better to handle. Also big claims were sent in by burnt-
out farmers, and the Department had to pay up for using
coal which gave more sparks and smoke than heat. At
last Dr. Jack, formerly of Queensland, was turned into a
Commission and took evidence and made experiments,
with the result that only a small proportion of Collie coal
is to be used in future. A three years’ contract with Zeb.
Lane’s Proprietary Co. was provisionally arranged on that
basis by the late Daglish Government, conditionally upon
an agreement being entered into between the miners and
the co. This has not been done, and there’ll be more
ructions in the future. Zeb. threatens to defy the unions
and carry out the contract with “free labor,” but it
remains to be seen whether the Rason Government will
ratify the provisional agreement of its predecessors. Any-
way, the Collie coal is becoming a national nuisance.

The Sunshine Harvester crowd had the happy
thought of getting 150 farmers together for a smoke-
social after the Adelaide Show, and urging them to fight
the American octopus in the matter of harvesters.
Binders were admitted to be hopelessly in the hands of
the trust, until High Protection conies, but the Sunshine
manager offered to make oath that the price of Austra-
lian-made harvesters would be reduced if sufficient Protec-
tion is given to shut out the Yankees. Incidentally, it
was suggested that Australian manufacturing concerns
should be required to produce samples of war material-
guns, clothing, &c.—with a view to their being ready
with a supply when called on.

“ Trucker ”: Astute manager Rhodes, of Waihi

If he gave those figures you could see the size of a few of

hear some “ lusty” enough language re the Bull-owned

“ Petramos ” : The snow that fell in rural
S. Australia recently almost brought along a
little job for the undertaker. A small child ate a
large quantity, and it rushed to his stomach,
causing him considerable anguish. But some
country folk have stomachs of cast-iron. I once
took two pounds of cherries to a station, a little
way north of Adelaide. They were pretty stale
w j ien I arrived, so I gave the whole bag to a boy
who came up to unharness the horses. He had
never seen such fruit before. Ten minutes after-
wards I met him. He showed me the empty bag.
“Finished ’em,” he murmured. “They’re
orlright.” “Where are the stones?” I asked,
looking round for the remains of the two pounds
of cherries. “ Stones ?” he said. “ Stones ? Oh,
you mean them pips in the middle. Oh, I ate
them.” A youth with a couple of hundred cherry-
stones in his interior should be a profound anxiety
to himself and his friends and supporters, but this
one was quite cheerful.

“ Cobbitty ” : Jte “ Elmore’s ” question
about wombats, &c. (B. 7/8/’O5). Out in the
Oberon district, from the Fish River along the
Great Dividing Range to the Mt. Werong gold-
diggings, wombats are to be found in thousands.
They give selectors a great lot of trouble by bur-
rowing under the “ ehock-and-log ” fences, and
knocking them down. I always found that the
length of the burrows depended much on the kind
of country they were in. Have never known
them to go over GOyd. anywhere. The average
length is 25yd. to 30yd. Have often got them by
digging, shooting and trapping—mostly dig-
ging. Used to have a couple, of dogs that were
very fond of hunting them. When they got into
a burrow and started to worry one, I would listen
along the surface of the ground, and find where it
was, and then sink a hole straight down. The
depth was mostly about 2ft., and seldom over 4ft.,
except on a steep hillside. Have known them to
double back in a circular fashion, and so keep the
dogs blocked in, until released—many dogs are
starved to death in that way. The wombat is a
very savage animal when roused, and will stand
his ground against a dozen dogs. I have never
seen dogs kill one outright. A very easy way of
shooting a wombat is to set a rabbit-trap in his
burrow, tie a gun up to a sapling straight in front,
then connect a piece of string from the trigger to
the near-side jaw. I can remember crawling into
a burrow once, when a “ kid,” with a candle and
dad’s greenhide plough-reins, tied together.
These I made fast to a wombat’s leg, but I wasn’t
able to pull him out; so I went upon the hills
and caught old Commerce (an honest mare, in
spite of her name), and tied the plough-rein to
her. When all was ready, I hit the m. re
across the rump. She bolted like a mad
thing down the stony range with a big wombat
bumping behind like a full-blown football. Com-
merce never stopped until she blundered head-first
into an old sawpit and broke her neck. I untied
the reins and drove the wombat home —it seemed
very little the worse for its rough journey across
the selection. I never said a word about the old
mare ; but dad often said “it was a damn funny
thing how old Commerce came to break her neck
in the sawpit! ”
“ TheProoshan” : The
new-chum fossicker is easily
detected by his style of pan-
ning-off wash. He is so
frightened of losing a speck
that he takes as long over
one dish as an expert would
over six. The old-hand
slaps the dish well under
water, swirls it roughly
about, ever keeping the dirt
alive, and, with deft fingers
and the right employment
of water, soon reduces the
stuff to a spoonful. He
loses little or no gold, while
the tyro, afraid of the water,
keeps the stuff dry at the
back of the pan, and, with
his lap, lap at the lip of the
dish, earns much backache
and loses gold (provided it’s
there to lose). A really
good way of disposing of
the last bit of sand is to tip
the dish, allowing the water
to drain off, then to spit the
biggest spit at command
into the very eye of the
gold, whereupon the sand
at once rises free from the
metal, and is easily washed
out of the dish. This an-
swers also with tin.
Irump : Often wondered how foxes suc-
ceeded in capturing fowls when latter are roosting
m trees. An old farmer laughed at my ignorance
the other day, and said that it was done quite
simply. The fox first attracts their attention,
and, having done this, he runs round and round
the tree until the fowls, fascinated by his gyra-
tions, or giddy with trying to follow his circular
proceedings, tumble to the ground.

‘‘Terry” : Travelling from Burkefcown to
the Tablelands with a mate—horses in low condi-
tion and finances ditto—we were offered a Road
Board job to clean out a well; work to be inspected
and_ passed by the manager of an adjoining
station. When we got to the well my mate
would not go down ; and, as he was weakly and I
bulky, I wouldn’t chance letting him lower me.
So we set to work and baled her, wetted the
ground well, and collected a lot of dingo bones
close to the mouth. The white ants had built
nests on the timbers for a good way down, and we
were to clean these off. We thought we were
beaten, when it happily occurred to us to knock
them off with stones, so we pelted away for a day,
and after using half a ton of geology we had ’em
all knocked into the water. Told the manager we
had finished, and when he came over we showed
him the debris we had collected, told him we had
got it out of the well, and asked him to let us
lowe ; r him down to inspect. It was a risky bluff,
but it came off. He didn’t like the idea of being
let down 80 feet, so he passed the work as well
and faithfully done, and paid us ten beautiful
quid. We’ve never had occasion to pass that way
since. [lf “Terry” ever passes this way The
Bulletin will be glad to tell him that it thinks
him a thief for so taking down the Road
Board.]

Bishop Gilbert White’s reported dis-
covery of a blackfellow 7ft. high in Carpen-
taria, “proportionately built, possessing, in addi-
tion to a perfectly-moulded form, the strength of
a Sandow,” is quite in keeping with early reports
of the luxuriance of much of the Gulf country.
The aborigines, their trees, birds and fishes have
impressed most travellers by their unusual size.
Captain Pennefather joined “strapping” men,
with “gigantic” palms and “huge” catfish.
There is no doubt that the Gulf countrv will be
found highly suitable for white settlement, despite
the claims set up for yellow labor.

“ Hiphen ” : “ C.H.R.’' (B. 7/9/’O5) says
that a homing bee does not always fly straight.
This is true in the case of a bee that is return-
ing from the club, but any self-respect-
ing bee, full of good, non-intoxi-
cating pollen, returns to his
domicile as straight as the fly
crows. . I fear those gentlemen
who aver that they have traced
the bee in his homeward flight
are gentlemen whose consciences
have run to imagination. The
bee flies as straight and as fast
as a commercial traveller drinks.
The best way, if youwant honey,
is to use treacle.
“ Workington ” : I believe the total in-
ability of the Bill-Jim person to judge distances is
his strongest point. I was recently wayfaring
from ; Moree to Pallamallawa, and, after several
abortive attempts to fix the mileage, lit out on a
20-mile basis, this being the estimate of a stock
and station agent. At Boolooroo, four miles out,
met a teamster and he thought the distance from
there to Pallamallawa was 19 miles. A mile
further on met a weird-looking individual, who
said he didn’t know the exact distance but it must
be or 23 miles. Later, with the village in
sight, about two miles on the starboard bow, a
hardy peasant informed me it was just six miles
from the last mile peg !

“Jimmie Pannikin”: At one well-kept
hotel on the Darling we had two eggs each for
breakfast every morning. Each egg was branded
with a name and a date. The names were
‘‘Auntie,’ “Biddy,” “Speckleay,” “Whitie,”
“ Blackie.” “ Orpie, ” “Leggie,”&c. One morn-
ing the bank-inspector rang the cow-bell vigor-
ously. “ Tell Mrs. Dropogoodstuff that I decline
to eat these two eggs put on my plate.” The girl,
Mulga Mary, carried the rejected eggs out. In-
spection showed that they were branded “ Whitie,
10/7/’O3” and “Biddy, 11/9/’Ol.”
Deeby : Told to me by the oldest
native of Wellington (N.S.W.). The first sheep
station established thereabouts was worked almost
entirely by convicts, kindly lent by the Govern-
ment of the day. The men’s eating room adjoined
the kitchen, their “ feed ” being passed to them
through a ticket-office-like opening cut in the
partition. One day “Cockney George,” offered
to kiss the cook through this orifice, and that
shocked and virtuous female reported the matter
to her mistress. George denied the charge, and
was ordered to receive 15 lashes for his affability
to the cook and 15 more for telling a lie. The
mistress, after the manner of the gentle and refined
English lady of the period, stood by with her baby
in her arms to watch the flogging, and the baby
applauded loudly. In fact it was so much pleased,
and so much disappointed when the show was
over, that George got five lashes extra to keep the
offspring amused. He might have got more than
that, but the infant got tired just about then, and
wanted to go and stick a pin in the cat.

This from an irreverent young woman :
The local preacher is one of a species I can’t get the
hang of, somehow. lam camping in the lean-to at the
back of a country school. The lean-to is misnamed the
teacher’s residence. The school-building is used every
Sunday as a Methodist church ; so I stay in bed and hear
all that goes on the other side of the partition. Last
Sunday a galoot was talking through his neck about the
99 sheep and the one stray. He said he knoo they
’adn’t sheep, but supposin’they was’eife.rs instead. He
asked them, in a crescendo voice, what they’d do if one
of their ’eifers was gone—wouldn’t they go trampin’ an’
trampin’ all day, per’aps through failin’ timbers, an’
burnin’ timbers, an’ scrub, or per’aps through floods?
But nothin’—nothin’ would stop them from findin’ that
’eifer. He then likened his congregation to ’eifers
wandering to perdition. Poor unfortunate South Gipps-
landers 1 The little perdition they’ve got up their sleeves
isn’t worth mentioning. Their only recreation is the
weekly visit to listen to the sky-pilot who drones at them
orribly about ’eifers.
BOUNDING UP CATTLE ON A SALVA-
TION ARMY IMMIGRANT FARM.
S. A. Agricultural Congress has been sitting
on the fox—not literally, for the brute would
bite from underneath, but sitting in consulta-
tion —there being some doubt as to whether
it does not do as much good by killing rab-
bits as harm by killing sheep. Narracoorte dis-
trict council, in the south-east of the State, paid
bonuses on 1915 foxes destroyed last year ; on the
other hand, some sheep-owners in the same dis-
trict advertise that they will prosecute anyone
hunting on their properties. The Congress (almost
unanimously) decided that Reynard is a pest, and
that legislation for his destruction is wanted.

A Chinaman, making for Queensland from
the Northern Territory, was recently lost between
Anthony’s Lagoon and Renner Springs. A police-
man found the heathen having his dinner. A
bullock had got bogged, and John had coolly made
a fire at the rear part of the beast. As the meat
cooked, the Chow devoured it. He had no knife
nor any sharp instrument, so pulled the half-cooked

CONNEMARA CREEK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now, the little one-horse township known as Connemara
Creek
Was the home of peace and harmony—an Eden, so to
speak.
T.iere was only one church-building in this hamlet in the
hush
For the “ West-leans,” and the “ Romans,” and the
11 Church of Ingland Push ” !
Tll ei dno local priest or parson, as the place was much
too small,
And, except the church, no building that was public,
save the “ Hall.”
They’d one butcher, and one baker, and one pub. and
general store,
And one blacksmith (Sandy William), and one constable-
no more !
When there was a Sunday service all the township used
to go
(Made no difference who was preaching), “ just to give the
bloke a show.”
Church was always in the morning, barring when there
was full moon,
And they played “ two-up ” religiously all Sunday after-
noon.
And the bobby used to go to sleep, as bobbies ought to
do
When the law-abiding citizen requires a drink or two,
And a more obliging officer it would be vain to seek
Than the guard of law and order up at Connemara Creek !
’Twas an axiom of the settlers—one you may not quite
condone—
That a man who wanted mutton was a fool to kill his
own ;
But a custom once accepted a community allows,
So they killed each others’ wethers and they milked each
others’ cows 1
And if Jones had fowl for dinner, folks were not aston-
ished when
They were told that Smith or Robinson had lost a Brahma
hen !
But although in moral principles they might be some-
what weak,
They were happy in their sinfulness at Connemara
Creek 1
But, alas, when Sandy William took a trip to Sydney
town,
Though his little wife had cautioned hirn he might be
“ taken down,”
He behaved in such a manner that he wasn’t there two
days
When his cash .was all expended in most questionable
ways !
And he stood before a portrait which he noticed pasted
on
Some large hoarding, and exclaimed : “Why, that is old
Jack Robertson ! ”
But a gentle voice behind him breathed in honeyed
accents smooth :
“ No, my brother ! you’re mistaken ; that’s our general,
General Booth ! ”
MOTORING ON THE MELBOURNE-SYDNEY ROAD.
T. Rand dashing into creek near Longwood (Vie.), on Bent’s
neglected highways.
Sandy William grew repentant, and to Connemara
Creek
He returned with Ensign Blowhard, and in less than half
a week
What had been a peaceful township, and a happy, had
become
Something very like a sacerdotal pandemonium 1
Ensign Blowhard raised a “regiment” and the regiment
raised a row,
And the riot raised the money, which came pouring in
somehow.
It was wondrous where it came from, but it did ! Till it
was known
One fine morning Ensign Blowhard had departed “ on his
own.”
Took the cash? He did most surely. He took every
blessed bean !
Which the clergy all regarded as unpardonably mean !
He was never in the “Army”; he was “pitching fairy
tales,”
And had learned the style from “ officers ” who visit at
the gaols !
But there’s once more peace and harmony on Sunday
afternoon
While the bobby sleeps a sleep that’s something very like
a swoon ;
But though years have flown it’s still unsafe of holy Booth
to speak,
His mem’ry has been buried deep at Connemara Creek !

“ Bowyang ” tells a tale of infamy
In the matter of dog-“ doping ” (B. 22/6/’O5). I
and another scoundrel once owned and ran some pretty
good dogs at country coursing meets. In those days we
knew how to train them, although our knowledge of
doping and betting tactics had not yet matured. A visit
to a metropolitan course convinced us that there was
something at times in running a bye. Next trip we had
wh B, ?° U !u e t ; ou i: ses > and on the morrow had to do
battle for the final. Partner suggested stiffening the dog.
Scientific doping was a bit beyond us, but our candidate
that morning received a generous leg of boiled mutton to
make him heavy, and the senior partner, without entering
into needless details, deputed a hairy mutual friend, also
from the backblocks, to place our available capital at the
best price obtainable on the other canine. But the hare
didn t go long enough to give the boiled mutton
a chance ; and two more - dejected sports never
gathered up the dog that had caused their ruin
At the gate, we were met by a hatless, breathless indi-
vidual, very audibly agitated, but whose general demeanor
s ® e “ led t 0 suggest a possibility. In occasional intervals
of lucidity, he explained that he had in some cases to lav
heavy odds, but he had managed to get the money all
on .-' 'l®, cursed appropriately ; but when he further
related that he had collected and had sufficient bullion
over and above what he had spent on beer, to sink a
whaleboat, we fell upon his neck like one man, and
blessed his dunderheaded greenness. The wink had not
been given to him with sufficient clearness. And if I
hadn t, in that wild, irresponsible moment, leaped a yard
in the air and yelled, “ Hooray ! We backed our own dog
after all, no one would have suspected anything.

“Brick” : Dimboola (Vic ), which is half
German, was invaded a while back by some of
Henry Lawson’s bush heroes. They sopped up so
much beer that immediate telegrams for more
beer went down the line. Sundry accidents hap-
pened to them. One crawled into the bread-man’s
bakehouse, and went to sleep in the just-set
sponge. Another entered the bootshop and pelted
the boot-man with his own boots. A third met
,one of the citizens, who wasn’t singing “God
Save ” loud enough. He gave him a patriotic
push on the nose, which sat him in the gutter.
But when four of them marched up and down,
singing “To Hell with the Kaiser,” Dimboola
arose and pushed them outside its gates with
much violence. I met them making their way to
Nhill, where Irvine comes from. They told me
their woes, finishing up with “Them there blokes
ain’t got no bowels.” I replied in German. I
learnt eleven new swear words in the next
seconds.

under the name of Weebo, with the murder of a

charged along with him. Weebo died while the
case still hung fire, and was buried under the name
of Mullud. Then the Court proceeded to finish
trying Mullud under the name of Weebo, and,
finding its mistake, it decided that the matter was
too far gone to be disentangled, and told Mullud
to go away and look for ’possum, and be a better
aborigine in future.

“ WalD.” tells the story of an arbitrator: —
They had drifted apart, they who, for many years, had
tramped together. A few hot words, after a silly quarrel
and a hasty resolve, and they stood, each with his swag
rolled, ready to say “Good-bye.” But neither spoke,
and, after an awkward pause, they turned to go. Laddie,
the dog, who had followed their fortunes ever since' the
day when, while yet a puppy, the two mates had found
him, ran uneasily from one to the other, as they slowly
separated, whining as he went in a dismal fashion. When
100 yards or more lay between the two, Laddie sat upon
his haunches and howled as though in entreaty. Both
men hesitated, turned round, and then moved slowly
towards each other. As they approached him, Laddie
showed a frenzy of delight. The two men reached each
other. One said awkwardly, “D you, Bill!” The
other hesitated a little and then said, “ D-- you, Ben.”
Then they both d d the dog, and once more all was
brotherhood.

“ Veritas ” on cats :
Twenty years ago native cats were fairly plentiful in
North Gippsland, Vic. When lads, we used to go
’possuming, and would almost always encounter a dozen
or more of them. They were very bold and decidedly
cunning. They used to regularly pay visits to the fowl
roost, which in those days consisted of an old log fence
or a pig-sty. Cat is (or was) an animal of epicurean
tastes when variety was obtainable, being particularly
fond of duck. Put three ducks under a gin case one night,
and half-a-dozen bricks on top. Next morning one duck
was dead. The cat’s method was to scratch a very small
hole under the box, kill the duck and suck the blood,
very little of the flesh being touched. I determined to
catch pussy, so set two rabbit-traps, one at supposed
place of cat’s entrance and the other alongside. Second
night found cat secured by the snout in one (the plate of
which I had greased) and by the hind leg in the other.
I have not seen a native cat about here for many years.

“Wiljar”: The newchum wasn’t rheu-

prior to crossing the One Tree Plain, pitched a
few sticks into the waggon for billy-boiling pur-
poses, the newchum looked puzzled. “ What
about wood?” he asked. “Waggon,” said the
boss. “Not enough there.” “Be d——d !”
snorted the boss ; “if yer want a forest chuck on
wot wood yer like.” First day’s journey over,
the new chum threw off about 15s. worth of wood
and lit it. After tea he raked away the ashes and
made two beds on the ground—where the fire had
been. “ Going to turn in ?” he interrogated with
restraint. “ Yuss.” The boss picked up one of
the beds and retreated into the gloom. “If I
freeze to death,” he hissed to himself, “ I’ll freeze

“ D.H.R.”: I have seen men who could
“ flick ” the head off a venomous snake. Once in
Mungindi district (on Mungindi station) saw a
boundary-rider swoop down on a tiger snake, pick
him up by the tail, flick him above his shoulder,
and that snake’s head left his body with much
expedition. Another time, in the Walgett
(N.S.W.) district, a man (Arthur M‘Cormic),
stockman on Gingis station, was seen by several
to snatch a seven-feet brown snake from his
hurried career, and thus behead him with celerity
and neatness.

Tommy’s shin Whs ripped up; leaving a gaping
wound fully eight inches long and an inch deep,
and laying the bone bare. Stoically he bore the
pain till his lubra went to the river bank—the
locale was Limeburner’s Creek—and obtained a
quantity of black ooze. This she plastered on the
injured limb, then it covered over with blue gUntJ
leaves, binding up tightly with strips of wild flax.
Inside of three weeks I saw my countryman, fit,
well, and desirous of rum, in Raymond Terrace, 15
miles from the scene of the accident.

“ : Why will the half-baked
naturalists who write to the Sydney dailies per-
sist in calling the lyre-bird the “native pheasant”?
Menura, is but distantly related to Phasianus,
which has only one representative in Australia—a
Queensland bird of plain black and brown plum-
age, but otherwise closely resembling P. colchicus,
the typical pheasant. It looks bigger by reason of
its plentiful feathering, but is really so miserably
skinny that it’s hardly worth a cartridge. The
cock-bird’s call, heard oftenest at dawn and dusk,
is a hollow, far-reaching “hoo-hoo-hoo,” which
suggests anything but a bird’s call. Probably
this fowl occasionally moves southwards into
N.S.W. ; and I have an idea that it is its weird
call which recently set sundry aboriginaliars
guessing.

“Vigilans”: Victoria Downs station
(N.T.) musters 60,000 head of cattle on 11,000
square miles of country ; rent.
Is. per square mile. They
employ six white men. Wave
Hill measures 6700 square
miles and musters about the
same. There are no im-
provements or wells. Mr.
Tom Cahill, of Wave Hill,
said in a recent Bulletin
that the white man can do
all the tropical work on these
stations. Exactly. There is
no work in the N.T. or Kim-
berley that a white man can-
not do if you pay him for
doing it. Victoria and Daly
River country is splendid,
and would grow anything of
a tropical or sub-tropical
nature; yet this country is
cut up into “blocks” the
size of Ireland, and held by
syndicates at a bob a mile.
There is a 60-inch rainfall,
and what could not be done
with that ? The stations em-
ploy half-a dozen whites and
scores of niggers, with a
Chow cook. The climate for
six months is ideal; two are
warmish ; four are hot. But
malaria is a myth. Fruit
and vegetables grow without
any trouble. White ants are
a drawback. Cut this land
up, and the country would
make rapid strides. To say
the white can’t work in Dar-
win is bunkum. The station-
master has been there for 18
years without going away.
The proprietor of the Club
Hotel has worked for nine
years in Darwin. He built
the railway sheds —was 18
months working on the gal-
vanised iron roof without a
day’s spell, and knocked out
16 Chows. Pay the white
man, and there is no work he
cannot do in Darwin or any other part of Aus-
tralia. But the mean whites of the North support
cheap Asiatics and say the white man is not
reliable.
“Den”: Here in S. Aus. we call the
butcher-bird the Darwin jackass. Have had one
for two years. Like jack., he loves raw meat and
insects. Also eats mice and sparrows, which he
catches. Is a creature of sedentary habits and
irritable temperament. Emits an annoyed cackle
when strangers approach, and is game for any-
thing that walks or flies. Have taught him to
whistle, which he does clearly and shrilly, but
only when annoyed. He has the run of the yard ;
and he hangs his surplus tucker round on shrubs
and trees —-hence, I suppose, his name—and uses
shocking language when the hens raid his larder.

‘ * Tramp ” : Mohammed is getting a solid
footing in some Vic. farming districts. Farmers
are beginning to employ him about the dairies,
and occasionally rent him onion land on third
share. One farmer in the Western District will
never pass Mohammed on the road without offer-
ing him a lift, and he is such a big employer of
black—and cheap—labor that he is already known
as the Sultan of Johore. Mohammed’s bundle is
becoming scarce in the land, and Mohammed him-
self is now often a dairy farmer and runs his buggy
and pair. Regarded in his agricultural capacity,
Mohammed is anything but a hard worker, has
the instincts of a pig, and the principles of a
trouser-button. And his home life ? I have seen
eight of him domiciled in a ten by eight hovel.
They have not yet arrived at the thought of sani-
tation, and the odor that meets one at the door of
their hut is—well, Mohammed.
“ Gorm ” : Have often wondered which is
the fastest flier of our Australian birds. I’m
inclined to place the “green leek” first. The
quail, swallow, and bronzewing all fly well when
in a hurry, but the “ leek,” when cut off from his
mates at roosting time, goes like green lightning.
WIFELY CON CEBU.
MRS. BROPHY: “ Git up, you guzzlin' bla'guard,

bors see ye lyin’ there dhrunk ez a, pig, an'

“Drifter” : Has any bushnian known a
horse’s hoofs to grow again after completely
crumbling away? Know of a horse that was
worked at a Newcastle (N.S.W.) mining pit,
where the ants bored into his hoofs. Eventually
the animal was limping painfully on the mere
shells of his original shale crushers. Owner finally
got him out to a swamp padd'gck towards
Waratah, where it was his intention to shoot
him, but his heart failed him. Later the
horse was seen crawling and picking the grass
across the semi-marshy places, and about five
months after, when his owner happened to
wander out one day, he was astonished to see his
crippled gee-gee trotting festively round with
some young’uns that had been turned into the
paddock. Investigation showed that the hoofs
had grown almost perfect again. The animal is
now racing round Sydney in a commercials
buggy.

‘ ‘ Elmore ” : There are many curious finds
made in wool stores. In one season (1900) a man
in the wool business told me he found 15 pocket
knives, four dog-hooks, a coat, two hats, three
coins (highest a 25.-piece), a dead lamb, flat as
Saturday’s beer, and a pair of shears. Needles
and palms can be found in nearly every bale, and
rocks and lumps of iron, such as camp-ovens,
broken up, are not uncommon.
BUSH PHILOSOPHY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When you’ve been and made a blunder,
What’s the use of lookin’ blue ?
Laugh and face the chaps around yer
They have done far worse than you;
Don’t let others see yer chewin’
’Cause yer head won’t fit yer hat;
Knock off mopin’, and be doin’
Anything but whip the cat.
Lord ! it makes me feel quite fishy
When my mate harps on the “ Wish he
Hadn’t been and blewed his money
On that little burst he had.”
And the theme of every sentence
Is a forty-pound repentance
For the paltry three-and-tenpence
Spent in beer that made him bad.
Put away those priest-made notions
That “mankind was made to mourn”:
That “ we’re only here to fit us
For a brighter, happier morn.”
This is all the life we’re sure of ;
Laugh, and chance the life elsewhere ;
Our first duty on the earth is
To be happy while we’re there.
So, when you’ve been getting beerful,
Don’t sit whining, glum, and tearful,
Keep your pecker up ; look cheerful.
Paste this maxim in your hat:
“ When your sin’s worth only tenpence.
Don’t waste pounds in vain repentance ;
Keep your eye on this short sentence :
‘ Life’s too short to whip the cat.’ ”

SALVATION BOOTH’S IMMIGRANTS, A VISION OF THE FUTURE.


The sorry dyspeptic, submerged in his gloom,
Who feels most dejected and fit for his tomb ;
The poor hypochondriac who wanders in woe,
With no one to speak to, and nowhere to go,
Whom no consolation nor comfort can please,
Who maintains he’s a martyr to every disease,
|Let them aid their digestion and keep their blood pure
And recruit upon Woods’ Great Peppermint Cure.*

Fiesumably the battle would be carried on by the
revocation of all anti-sweating laws. J
, t ,A\ Abley, aged 81, of Warracknabeal
(Vic.), recently walked seven miles in four minutes
less than an hour. A collection of £2 14s. having
been taken up for him, the octogenarian gave one-
third of the amount to the local hospital.
Mr, H. Sparkes, the secretary of the
National Protection Union, who buzzes like a
billion bees in the cause of Australian manufac-
tures, has been presented by some of the malefac-
tors who dare to manufacture with a free railway-
pass over all Australian lines, so that he may buzz
over a bigger area than before.
A London item tells that 17 members of
the Tooth family, headed by Sydney’s old brewer
friend, .Robert Lucas, are fighting the church
authorities over a memorial window to certain
deceased Tooths in Cranbrook Church, Kent. So
far the fight is against the brewers, but the 17
Teeth are resolved to see it out.
S.A- Education Department officials sent
their usual wreath of bay laurel and daffodils this
year to the grave of J. A. Hartley, killed in Sep-
tember, 1896. They had the wreath inscribed
in affectionate remembrance of their great
chief.” Few Government officials are remem-
bered in that way for nine years after their death
but Hartley was an exceptional man.
The wealth that three rich dead men left
behind them was formally announced in Mel-
bourne last week. James Aitken, of Tooralc, left
£53,281. John Russell M'Pherson deserted £60,000
and Colin William Simpson abandoned £8534 in
Victoria and £173,065 in Hew South Wales, the
latter representing station property in Riverma.
Premier Bent, of Victoria, once admitted
that he was in the wrong. The event happened
so long ago that no one remembers the exact
thing that he was wrong about. Anyhow, Bent
had just discovered that he had put his foot into
it, and held forth in strenuous language. “I’ve
been a fool, he shouted to a friend 9 “a hignora-
inus, that’s what I am—a hignoramus. And, by
thunder, sir, you can spell it with a capital H.”
Ex-N". S. Wales Justice W. J. Foster,
whose name was pointedly mentioned during the
debate on the Judges’ Pension Abolition Bill, was
in January, 1831. He came to Australia in
1852, took to farming, and then studied for the
Bar, and was called in 1858. He was appointed a
Crown Prosecutor in 1859, and held office till 1877
when he became Attorney-General in the Farnell
Government, with a seat in the Legislative Coun-
cil. In 1887 he was Parkes’ Attorney-General.
I his office he resigned because Parkes broke faith
with him, as he did with Edward Butler in the
matter of a Supreme Court Judgeship. On Feb-
ruary 14, 1888, he was appointed Supreme Court
Judge, which appointment he resigned on De-
cember 17, 1894, after less than seven years’ ser-
vice, As a Judge he drew nearly £lB,OOO salary •
as a pensioner, £19,565, or a total as Judge and
pensioner of close on £38,000.

Someone digs up certain aged remini-
scences :

William Henry Moore and Frederick Garling, who arrived
in 1814, were given £4OO a-year each as a subsidy. Garling
became Clerk of the Peace, with private practice ; and
Moore, in 1826, became Acting Attorney-General during
the absence of Saxe Bannister. He was also Crown
Solicitor and Coroner. But the litigants in the teens of
last century were numerous, and the court, which con-
sisted of Mr. Barron Field, admitted one James Norton
to practice. Norton had come out as clerk to a female
convict ship, and having had a legal training he got into
practice quickly. The firm he founded still exists. Next
to him came George Allen, who arrived in the colony at
the age of 16 years, and was allowed to practise at the age
22 - , The bond ’ solicitors were George Crosslev
Edward Eagar, and Michael Robinson, who had a large
practice before and after the arrival of Moore and Garlino-.

From a man of reminiscences :
Apropos “ Ferostag" and historic names (B. 14/9/’O5).
Robert Sidaway, who held a lease on Church Hill though
a seven years man who came out by the first fleet, was a
person of some importance in the early days. He was a
baker and general provision dealer. We find him first as
a witness in the trial of Isaac Nicholls for receiving

He also built the first theatre in Australia, probably on
fMav 18 6 ?7qS h n UrCh 1 « Ed INBURGH ADVERTISER
(May 18, 1798) appeared the following “ The theatre at
Botany Bay was entirely built by convicts, and cost about
one hundred pounds. With singular propriety the
gallery is the largest part of the house. The admis!
smn is one shilling, which is paid in either money
or in flour or meat. A benefit for the widow
of a soldier who was drowned produced twelve
pounds. Saunders Newsletter (Dublin) of 12th
September, 1797, mentioned that Sidaway was living in a
state of great respectability,” and that he had a con-
tract for serving the colony with bread, and a free grant
BnWQM I hUnd r ed , aor “ of land > which he cultivated.”
Robert Sidaway died in October, 1809, aged 52 years His
obituary notice said “he was charitable and philanthro-
pic and a good citizen.” He was one of those who signed
the requisition to Colonel Johnston asking for the arrest
and deposition of Governor Bligh.
A certain young Queenslander is a striking
example of the indomitable energy occasionally
met with m the true Australian type,
.porn of humble parents, he first engaged
m the Mines Department as a clerk.
He was sent to one of the mining towns.
After a year or two he asked leave to sit
•4 • University examinations. While
Brisbane he explained to the office
that he had obtained an engineer’s cer-
tificate, and asked permission, while in
the city, to go up for examination as a
mine manager. He succeeded at the
University exam., and also got his mine
manager’s certificate, provided he put in
a certain time under ground. Quite
recently he was admitted to practise as
a barrister, and he is now studying bac-
teriology—on a salary of £9O a year !
He may not have made much money so
far but for energy a red ant and a bee
and a circular saw don’t compare with
him.
“Adelaide” : Be the M.P. and
the athletic club nuisance (B. 20/7/’O5).
E. T. Smith, S.A. ex-brewer and phil-
anthropist, was supposed to hold the
record for that kind of thing, till even
he got tired. He was patron, or presi-
c*ei}t ’~o r V ;P- of every really big sporting
club (barring racing) in Adelaide, and of
nearly everything big or little in his own
district of East Torrens. Then he moved
into the Leg. Council, and represented
the southern district—one-fourth of the
whole State—and all the clubs right
down to Mount Gambier settled on him
like mosquitoes. It was the same Smith
who, at the height of his popularity, was
driven to advertise that all his gates
would be locked on New Year’s Eve;
because bands used to come and play (and drink

through the night.
Russian statesman D© Witte, who estab-
lished the credit of Russia in the past, and will
perhaps be given the task of setting up its Consti-
tution, like the Italian statesman, Crispi, married
for love, but not “happily,” as the social world
would judge. Countess Witte is a Jewess and
was formerly wife of an obscure clerk in Witte’s
department. She divorced her first husband to
marry Witte, and consequently is not “received ”
m Russian society.
Cabled that Thomas Reibey, squire of
Entally, Launceston (Tas.), is seriously ill with

Mr. Reibey is 84 years of age and a grandson of

colonist of the very early days, who has been by
many dubbed the veritable Margaret Catchpole.

W. F. Schey, autocrat of N.S.W. unem-
ployed, is a Londoner, of warrior ancestors, and
has been just on 30 years in Australia. He is 48
years of age, and one of the fat men of the day.
Narandera (N.S.W.) Argus has a political
history. It was once owned by N.S.W. Minister
for Lands Ashton, and Victorian Opposition
leader Prendergast served his time on it, and
afterwards bossed the shop.
That brawny, capable Scot, McGregor,
who long frizzled as a Governor in New Guinea
and West Africa, now freezes in Newfoundland
his personal pull in the Colonial Office being still
weak. His 10 years’ hard work in Papua entitled
him, as he thought, to a Governorship in Queens-
land or South Australia, or some other healthy
climate, but men with more influence and less
brains got the billets. In acquiring a good
governorship woman has more influence than art,
science and literature combined.
“F.”: Kindly let me correct an error
re the M‘Arthurs (B. 21/9/’O5). Capt. John
Macarthur, of the old “Rum-sellers,” is a dis-
tinct personage from the other Australian
M‘Arthurs. The rum-seller was of Scotch descent,
born at Plymouth, where Governor Bligh said his
father kept a tailor’s shop. He (John) had sons,
but none of them left a male descendant, Mrs.
Macarthur-Onslow being the sole representative!
The other M‘Arthurs are North of Ireland Wes-
leyans, and in the softgoods trade.
Labor-member Lunsford, of Queensland,
died lately at Cunnamulla, whither he had gone
to breathe some of the far-western air, in the
hope of getting relief from lung troubles. Duns-
ford’s heart was in the cause of Democracy, and
he attended so closely to his Parliamentary duties
that he did not once miss “prayers” in the
Assembly during his membership. He was a
prominent fighter during the great shearers’
strike, and in recognition of his merits Charters
Towers made him its member, and returned him
regularly as long as he lived. Altogether he
represented the golden town for 12J years.
The wine and spirit business in which the
late W. E. Sparke, of Sydney, made his fortune,
stood upon the same spot for over three-quarters
of a century, and only recently the ancient build-
ing made way for a new structure. It stood in a
lane opposite the Victoria Markets, and was
founded by Richard Brownlow, who had kept the
Canning Tavern in King-street. Most of the
wine and spirit merchants of that time had evolved
from the public-house. After Brownlow come
Dan Egan, Walford and Sparke, and D’Arcy and
Co., in which Mr. Carson, the Sparke legatee, has
an interest.
Decided by medical observation in Mel-
bourne that there is nothing mentally wrong with
P. A. M‘Anulty, ex-taxing officer of the Supreme
*-Vurt—the man who refused to be sacked.
M Anulty s curious actions were, presumably,
the result of a too acute sense of grievance *
his race s capacity for nursing a grievance
is notable, and a too tenderly nursed grievance is
apt to become as a snake in the bosom. Under the
circumstances, the Victorian Government would
take the dignified course if it treated M ‘Anulty ’s
case with a big leaning towards mercy.
Ned Hawker, the new president of the
S.A. National Ass, is a great improvement on
lawyer Moulden, M.L.C., who preceded him
Hawker is a Cambridge M.A., a lawyer, and a
squatter; but now, having travelled through the
mining districts of North and South America,
and of Spain, practises as a mineralogist. He sat
in the Assembly long ago, but was defeated last
May for Adelaide. He is a son of the late
Speaker Hawker, and a grandson of Admiral
Hawker. His wife is a daughter of Chief Justice
Stawell, of Victoria, and is herself a University
graduate. Hawker is acknowledged by his
strongest opponents to be a courteous man and a
scrupulously fair fighter.
Yarrurn ’ : Talking to a retired coastal
skipper, last night, he told me that, among other
things, the late Ed. Hargraves, alleged first dis-
coverer of gold m Australia, had presented to him
by the merchants of London a case of silver plate
valued at over £5OO. The old skipper says he
took it from a ship in Sydney harbor, and
delivered it to Hargraves at Noraville, near Gos-
tord. Ihe late Queen, the ancient also informed
me, gave Hargraves a cheque for £500: but I
fancy that s a “ fairy.”
“ Den ” from Adelaide :
I stood on the kerbstone watching the Eight Hours
procession, t’other day, while the crowd cheered Premier
Tom Price who marched with his brother unionists.
Suddenly an agitated camera was clicked near my ear.
“ Bai Jove, who’s thet fella thej'’re making the noise
about ? ” inquired that which worked the kodak. I
turned and beheld a Willie boy, evidently just off the
mailboat. I told him “ thet ” was the Premier. “ Ah,
premier of the labah union, and thet sort of rot, Ai sup-
pose,” he remarked. I assured him no ; Premier of the
State, the top-notch man of the country, and a stone-
mason by trade. “ Oh, thet’s too rich, old chep,” he
said. “Ai wasn’t born yesterday, yer know.” Some of
the bystanders corroborated my statement, and then the
Willie stood;and gasped. “Is thet so?” he murmured.
“ And can’t you get a better sort o{ a johnny than thet
for your Premier ? ” I assured him it was the best we
could muster, and there had been worse, much worse.
He looked grave at that. Then he? said : “ What’s the.
fellah’s salary ! ” I told him. “ Dem it all! ” he pried,
“Ai think Ai’ll stop here for a while. Ai’m not doin,’
anything much just npw,, you know ; jest strollin’ round,
and thet sort of thing. Did you say a thousand pounds?
Bai Gad ! Not a bad little place to live in either. Ai;
stay.” So Price’s reign will be short. That
Willie is after his job.
About an explorer :
The late Ernest Giles tackled exploration work as far
back as 1861. In that year, he was out run-hunting on
the Lower Paroo, and went over a lot of country in the
Albert district. Panton, the veteran Melbourne P.M.,
went to the same part of the country on a similar mission
in the following year, and did a perish before he got back
to the settlements. His rations were exhausted, and his
torse thoroughly done up, when he ran across a cave in
the Scrope Range. Entering' it, he found a swag of stores
carefully done up in little bags, with a note requesting the
tinder to help himself. The note was signed “E. Giles.”
Pan ton did not broach the stores, but took a turn in his
belt and pushed on to Menindie Lake, which he reached
late the following night. He saw a small fire, and thought
he had struck a blackfellows’ camp, but found a tent with
Giles and a companion inside—waiting for rain. They
had a, nestful of swans’ eggs, and Panton got outside five
right away. They all camped there for several days, and
so a lifelong friendship was commenced. Old Baron von
Mueller took a grtat fancy to Giles, in whom he discerned
the makings of a great explorer, and sent him out (at the
baron s expense) to the Macdonnell Ranges. Tietkens ac-
companied him, and the baron was so pleased with the
results that he equipped them for another trip to the Mus-
grave Ranges. They pushed right on to the W.A.
boundary, where they were confronted by desert country,
which they could not penetrate for want of stores. At
any rate, they traversed three-fourths of the route after-
wards taken by Bigjohn Forrest, when making for the
overland telegraph-line from the W.A. side. The intrepid
Giles next made what he termed “ a forgotten expedition ”
from Eucla to Port Augusta. His splendid exploration
work met with a poor reward. To Brer Alick Forrest an
imposing monument is erected in the public park of
Perth to mark his services as an explorer. Giles, who
performed far better work under far harder conditions
rests m a lonely grave in a Westralian goldfields cemetery,
already forgotten by the men whose fortunes he helped to
build.
THE NEW GREAT POWER.
“You’re coming on sonny, coming on I”
“ Coming on! None of your dam patronage or
I’ll stoush YOU one in the jaw.”
Iceberg Irvine, from being a sort of fetish
in Victorian politics, has gradually sunk out of
sight until now he has become a back number.
The Augus resuscitates him on every possible
opportunity, but its “Mr. Irvine says so” is a
matter of no public interest. Irvine is still on tap
at Women’s League meetings and other political
dolls’-housebusiness ; but his “deliverances” are no
longer “great,” and members saunter out to the
bar when he commences, just as if he were not
the -“calm, strong equity lawyer” of Victorian
politics.
4,
Only as far back as 1902 the following
question was asked in the Queensland Assembly:
In view of the fact that prickly pear is now proved to
be valuable both as food and drink for stock, and likewise
as supplying- fruit and vegetable to man, will the Minister
for Lands see that this valuable plant is protected ?
Griffith and Allan, Patent Attorneys of
Sydney, have opened a branch of their business in
Melbourne—(Broken Hid Chambers, Queen-st.),
under the management of Mr. H. P. Keoah of
Melbourne.* 8 ’
Everybody has noticed how vastly Tommy
Bent’s politics have improved of late. But everybody
does not know that said improvement dated from Thomas’s
first visit to Daly’s reconstructed Turkish Baths, Royal
Arcade, Melbourne. Thomas breathed fervent blessings
on the improvements in the Baths, as he lay smiling on
the marble slab. Since then the blessings have returned
to him and sweetened his political career. What’s the
old adage about one clean politician being nearer to
godliness than a whole row of Wesleyans ?*
An interesting adjunct to the laundry show and
ironing festival in Melbourne was Buckley and Nunn’s
exhibit of the shirt making industry in full stitch, where-
by the utter absurdity of that ancient superstition, the
imported shirt, was intended to be brought right home to
the dullest Tory understanding. To see shirt-making
carried out on a B. and N. scale by a smart lot of girls—
undoubtedly smarter than the ordinary underpaid white-
workers of the Cold Country—is to be amazed at anti-
Australian prejudice which continues to provide a market
here for foreign starched-goods. Getting the material
direct from the looms under an easy tariff, the local
manufacturer can make for stock, or cut to order, a better
shirt than the higher-priced imported article. The
manager for “Buckley’s,” discussing the matter from a
retailer s point of view, reckons that the waning demand
for English-branded shirts deserves to be killed by a
prohibitive duty, even in the interests of the infatuated
purchasers, without regard to the interests of the local
factory. It employs a hundred or two hundred “hands”
to run a business that supports manufacturing industries
in which many hundreds of other “ hands ” are employed
and if the shirts and things made on the premises didn’t
command a profitable sale among the unprejudiced
majonty of the shops customers they wouldn’t be made at
all. This exhibit of linenery at the laundry show was an
appeal to the reasoning faculties of people who still
prefer foreign goods for their foreignness, and throw
money away in the indulgence of preposterously
unpatriotic fads.* * J

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
__. Sydney, September 26, 1905.
My Dear Arini, —
There’s something wrong with Australian
seasons. I want a Commission appointed to
lnquire-into the Inscrutable Ways of the Weather.
Ihe w inter was mislaid and spring acted as its
locum tenens and was a failure. Now, winter of a
most disagreeable kind has been found when it
wasn t wanted and spring is out of a job. The
owh for all his feathers, is a-cold-so what of the
poor bird in a transparent blouse ?
A recently divorced Sydney pair are showing
symptoms of remarrying each other. The fair
complexioned interloper still builds her hair, preci-
pice-fashion, above her forehead and is again in
bydney, but her name is now cinders so far as
concerns the man who forfeited so much for her
society. His wife is a legatee under a recent rich
wdl. The majority of men should marry—or re-
marry. By persistently remaining single a man
converts himself into a permanent public tempta-
tion. bo a notorious epigrammatist says. There
are some men who are not public temptations, but
they are few.
The Frank Gardners are still about Sydney and
were at some of the race meetings. The lady’s
appearance rather disappointed the rubber-necks.
Ihey expected someone “Frenchy-looking,” a
phrase that, as used by the majority, means comi-
cally operatic in get-up. Mrs. Gardner looks
a rather pored English gentlewoman. The
husband is crazily fond of his two-and-
a-half-year-old daughter. Whilst on the race-
course one day last week, a telegram informed
him that the child had cut a special kind of tooth,
or a tooth had cut her, or some such. Anyhow
the magnate fled off the course and up to
bunny Corner, near Bathurst, where his child and
her nurse were staying. (By-the-way, he has
mining interests also in that neighborhood.) Con-
cerning Carrie Swain : An Australian student in
Bans mentions in a letter to me that the clever
ex-artiste keeps up great style, and that she is
to-day apparently a more affluent person than
Jt rank Gardner himself.
Mr J. C. Williamson has bought the late rich
manbparkes mansion, “St. Monans,” in Eliza-
beth Bay, for £BOOO, and will go to live there
some tune next month. The impressario has now
three town houses on his mind. A mountain home
tvas sold some time since. In the few years he
owned it J.C.W. spent two days at that mountain
home. Ihe morning of his first and only visit he
was looking into the purple distances, and speak-
ing of the peace and restfulness of the atmo-
sphere, so far from telegrams, and ’phones, and
ink, and worry, when a boy on horseback
invaded the holy hush with fourteen mes-
sages that had arrived per wire, and a demand
for 14s. porterage. That sort of thing went on all
day till the messenger and the horse were worn
out, and for fear of having a dead boy on his
hands, and having to bury the horse, Mr.
Williamson fled back to the city* “ St* JVlonans ,5
where the rich old celibate lived and died—he
never travelled further than Sydney Heads—has
a water frontage, beautifully laid out grounds, and
the glass palm-house has the novelty of a
swimming bath with dressing rooms in its centre.
An auction sale of the late Mr, Sparke’s furniture,
marbles, and bronzes is going on to-day. The
fresco work on the ceiling of the dining-room
shows fruit-laden grape vines, with birds
anf . butterflies against a background of
rolling opalescent clouds. One of the curiosities of
the sale is the old-fashioned cedar bedstead, with
carved postsand velvet-brocade hangings, used by
its late owner to lie awake on while he wondered
what to do with all his wealth.
The Sparke domestic staff couldn’t have had a
very gay time. All had to be in by 10 o’clock,
and at that hour the gates were locked. To the
housekeeper, who had been with him for 23 years,
deceased left a life income of £250 a year. To his
butler “who had served him 14 years and had
never broken one article of all the valuable cut-
glass entrusted to his care ” he willed merely a
sum of £2OO. Yet surely he deserved more. An
every-day butler would have dropped that amount
on the floor and broken it inside two years.
Concerning those “Egyptian” tablets that the
archaeologist at Leland Stanford Uni. has hustled
out of the museum as unfit to lie under the same
glass case as other old cuneiform things: A
bydney doctor has photographs of some of them,
also he has two old Roman coins, one of which is
stamped with the head of Constantine. Coins
and tablets were, you may remember, sent on
from Melbourne to California. A Melbourne
man, who claims to be a Mahatma, had
these and scores of other such objects “sent”
to him. That is, they were brought by means or
forces not explainable to science—just poured on
the table when called for, as the ceiling might fall
on an ordinary individual. Mr. Stanford, the
late millionaire’s brother, who lives in Melbourne,
was a profound believer in Mahatma Guppy.
I hat s not his name, but the real one is just as
English and unromantic. Now it turns out that
the late Mrs. Leland Stanford’s visit to this
country was due to a desire to meet Guppy and
see his materialisations and collections of “sent”
coins (no gold ones amongst ’em) and billet doux,
written by Nebuchadnazzar in his salad days.
Curious thing that Americans—people who
have such a large allowance of common sense,
such a strong affinity for facts, and so great a
m arithmetic and tinned meat —are so
much given to spooks, Mahatmas and such soft
stuff as is fed to chickens. They couldn’t be easily
had over a deal in wheat or an oil-well
spurt, but mediums and Dowies have a walk over
them. (As to Dowie, I suppose we ought to feel
flattered that an Australian could take in so smart
a people.) Perhaps, like the old Athenians, the
Americans just like to run after what is new;
perhaps it’s a back swing of the pendulum—from
extreme hard-headedness to a slight softening of
what is inside the head. Certainly if the newness
does it, Guppy was new. At one seance he called
tor nsh, and a wet live bottle-nosed shark, wrapped
in sea weed, dripped on the table immediately. If
he had only demanded that Nicholas Willis be
produced on the instant!!
Miss Florence Young arrives in Sydney before
Ghristmas. She joins the Repertoire Co. Aus-
tralia is very glad that Florence and New York
didn t cleave to one another till death did them
part.
Cinnamon-complexioned soprano-voiced Fiorelli
will give a concert at Goulburn on Oct. 6. She
has a sentimental longing to sing in the town
where her mother was born. Captain Eden-
oorough the singer’s grandfather—was the origi-
nal owner of the station now in possession of Mr.
Harry Chisholm. Mr. Southwell will be pilot to
the little co., which will also include pianist
George Boyle and tenor George Grimm.
Violinist Stahl has acquired a young, spring-
chicken sleekness since he took to hen-farming.
In between the Chopin nocturnes he goes out to
catch eggs and pullets at his place at Belmore.
.Look at the back of his little cart any day, and
you 11 see beaks, feathered heads, and sinuous
necks poking out.
Horse-owner Stead, after the race had been to
his swift, took the four ladies who accompanied
mm and his daughter from Maoriland into
Hardy s the jewellers, and bediamonded them.
Miss Stead chose a diamond necklace—others
favored pendants. Spring and autumn race-
meetings are good seasons for the jewel-seller. A
horse wins and a woman is gemmed.
talking of jewellery reminds me of a funny
little circumstance. A partner in a well-known
Sydney firm was staying at Medlow Bath, and at
his wife s request sent some of her jewels to
Sydney to be put in his safe. “Give these to
onookcr, he said to the genius entrusted with
their care. Now, Snooker was one of his man-
agers, also Snooker had that day, or the day after
married a wife. “He was almost overwhelmed
by the magnitude of the wedding gift,” he said,
but he bore up bridegroomfully and presented the
sparklers to his bride !
Ethel Barrymore, the American actress, is to
marry an Englishman, one Captain Harry
Graham, an ex-guardsman and now private secre-
tary to Lord Rosebery. He has published a
book ot skittsh verse, “Misrepresentative Men.”

Of Nero burning the Jews :

To read a book by Israelight.
Lord Northcote’s newly-appointed A.D.C. is re-
la-tod to this author of clever conceits.
The Akgus MacKinnons (she’s a charming little
Scotswoman), who were at the Wentworth Hotel
for race-week, have gone back to Melbourne.
Ihey and the Septimus Millers “have taken the
whole house for the Autumn race-week.
The wife of a N.S.W. doctor was at Marienbad
during King Edward s last visit there, and she
writes that the King and the English press were
very indignant over the way the crowd jostled
®; n d stared at his Royal Highness. “ But ”
the Sydney woman writes, “if he did not want to
be stared at and chased, why did he dress in such
a remarkable way ? He wore a green Tyrolese
hat with a feather, a blue suit, tan boots, and a
flyaway red tie. I was one of the starers, but I
did not know till next morning that it was his
Majesty of England I was helping to annoy. I
thought it was the latest thing m musical comedv
potentates.” J
Next Saturday evening, the Symphony Orchestra
(Professional Musicians) will give a concert at the
Lyceum Theatre. Occasion will, in a sense be
specialised by the first appearance here of ’two
Queensland singers, who have come to reside in
Sydney and to enter its professional musical life
They are Misses May and Edith Collins. These
girls, who have sung considerably with Brisbane
Liedertafel, have uncommonly good contralto
vcnces. The elder will warble the Flower Song
{f° A m Faust,’aaM the younger Goddard’s
Angels Guard Thee. Later in the programme
the sisters will join m a duet with full orchestral
accompaniments.
Some day, when I get a nib that suits me I’ll
write a treatise on “Bird-lime.” It won't have
anything to do with ornithology or glue in a
literal sense. Man will be the “birds!” woman
the lime. Meantime I m marvelling over a ques-
tion that is on the rack in the “Women’s Page ”
of so many weekly papers-the question of how
li. ii \ w ° man “ ak ® herself attractive to men.
Shall she try to be like some woman in real life
who is confessedly attractive, or like some charmer
in a book ? Should she be silent and sympathetic,
or talky and entertaining ? Is she most
charming to the male when she? trXg
to make him think that he’s her god or
when shes cold and independent? If s he’s
better educated than he, hadn’t she better pre-
tend to be more ignorant than she is ? One
prophetess tells her girl readers that men do not
care for women who forsake the place “ that Pro-
vidence has assigned them in the home.” Another
asserts that men will make catherine-wheels of
admiration before the girl who refuses to be
dependent, and goes out to earn her own vittles
p and 'P ainte d muslins. The weeklies of
this Commonwealth are strong on these cribs
from Home Fakes, and such papers. Does
any paper ever get a rustle on itself and
tell men how to make themselves attractive
ai i ?i en ? fording to Coghlan and Dr
Arthur there are 80,000 more men than women in
Australia. These would surely be glad of hints
on hen-lime. As a matter of solemn fact, girls
are becoming curiously indifferent to marriage.
They are remaining single rather than marry
other than their accurate mate. But no girl with
a clever mother need remain single if she desires
to marry. A woman with a real turn for society
strategy can always manoeuvre a daughter into
matrimony, where the girl’s own efforts would
fail.
Sydney’s big red lamps are mostly alight
again after a short interval of extinguishment,
caused by the Adelaide Medical Congress. Drs.
Worrall, Chisholm Ross, Jarvie Hood, Arthur, J.
B. Nash, H. Marks, Foreman, Brady, Bowker,
Rennie, Armstrong, and Chisholm went down to the
city which is described by the wife of one of them as
giving an impression of “ clean prosperity.” Mrs.
Arthur, Mrs Bowker, and Mrs. Chisholm accom-
panied their husbands, and the whole medical
visiting crowd was nearly smothered under the
hospitality that would make it eat when it was
not hungry, drink when it had no drought, and
dance when its legs were already sagging with the
burden of much enjoyment.
Lady Northcote continues her good work of
booming Australian manufactures, and at latest
had ordered some special Australian design dinner-
ware from Bakewell s pottery, N.S.W. Since the
lady gave a hand to help Australian tweeds along,
Vicars, of Marrickville, is faced with the necessity
of having to either double his factory or give up
blanket-making, and confine hisattention to tweeds.
I hope he will do the former. I don’t see why,
having been a good Australian in an Australian
tweed all day, the citizen should have to turn in
and sleep between foreign blankets.
Mayor and Mayoress Allen Taylor, and Layton
of the Well Fitting Clothes, will pack their
candle-boxes and go to Melbourne for Cup week as
guests of Mayor and Mayoress Pleasance. Al*
ready, too, preparations are in pickle for the
evening party the Taylors will give the Jerseys
towards the end of November.
A marvellousiy beautiful picture—one that
would make you dream out loud —has been secured
by our Trustees of National Art Gallery. “On
the Roofs,” by C. Hoffbauer (a painter whose
name is unknown to Sydney artists), shows a night
phase of wealthy New York life. Two men and
two women, all young, are seated around a supper
table on a roof-garden. All around them from
countless windows of towering buildings rains the
subdued radiance of the electric light, deepening,
in the darker places of the picture, to a gem-like
pallor. One of the women billows with sun-
rayed white chiffon. Only the nape of her
beautiful neck shows, and her hair is
fair under a big black hat. Opposite her
muses the other woman in a misty-pink gown and
white feather hat. Both men, smoking cigarettes,
lean well back in their bamboo chairs. The com-
position gives the sensation of windless coolness
after a fiercely hot day. The “air ”of the figures
suggests lassitude, and one of the men has turned
his lean, clean-outlined face with a movement as
of conscious courtesy to some remark of the pink
woman’s. There is an entire absence of “ working-
up ” in the composition. Go close to it and the
texture of the canvas shows clear through the
figures faces. 1 hree little dabs of golden yellow
amt among the table appointments make, at
a distance, exquisitely indicated champagne
glasses. The silver and crystal on the table turn
jewel-like under the gleam and sparkle of the elec-
tnCf' ,- Yet ’ in spite of sky-scrapers and dynamo-
made lights, and indicated city smoke, the sense
of mystery, the rest and charm of night are pre-
served around the group.
Royal Art Society’s show curled its tail last
Saturday night. Then it went out of business for
another year. The “curl” was announced as a
Bohemian Night,” in aid of the Children’s Hos-
pi j V ne tj l6 Bohemians went collarless,
and they didn’t drink beer out of jam-tins or paper
_ So it was the new Bohemianism—not the
old land in shiftless boots, and uncertain pawn
tickets, and midnight revelry where the tallow
candle weeps in the bottle. The presence of
Chief Justicess Darley was a guarantee of the pro-
ceedings being kept up to Kosciusko’s chilly level.
Mrs. Harry Henderson (Miss Maggie Knight)
has started a school for dramatic training and
voice production in Sydney. Her husband, a
well-known Aucklander, was till lately manager
of a big shipping firm here. He fell into very bad
health and has gone to Vancouver. Miss Knight’s
long and successful stage career has well qualified
her to teach her art.
/-WAT I ®! interviewer who tries to get Miss Nance
O Neil on to thistle-down topics will labor in
vain. She does not look on life as being mostly
froth and bubble, and her mental storage has
nttle room for personalities. With a Why and
Whither expression in her blue eyes, she talks of
1 hingsand gropes among the stars, feeling after the
psychological instinct of Sudermann and Ibsen, the
dramaturgists of whom she is fondest. Pressed for
something autobiographical she rather reluctantly
shows views of her historic place on the Merrimac.
JLhe homestead is mentioned in one or more
American novels. There are two lakes on the
k.nd, and the house looks a great square palace,
borne of the_ views show the owner feeding the
deer or walking with the dogs or riding astride.
All looks as if the lady had struck oil. Then-
well, there’s “Magdalena,” the blue-eyed Persian
cat, a bad-tempered but favored beast, that the
tragedienne has with her at the Australia. Also,
there s the fact that Nance wears neither hair-
frame nor corsets.
Sydney trains and trams are covering their
nakedness with gum boughs and bunting in honor
of the Railway Jubilee. But not one bears
7 intimation that the people at the back
of the decorations owe eighty-three millions, and
that even the first shovel of earth that was
turned for the first railway 50 years ago is still
unpaid for. And how many generations of worms
must have fattened on that old, old security in the
interval!

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, September 25, 1905.
My Dear Yarrie,—
The State Exes, have been guesting at Winter-
Coolie’s extensive station. The squatter, who is a
widower, uses his wealth without fuss, and it was
only by the merest chance that the Talbottles,
happening to select Hamilton for a jaunt, found
him with a palm spread in greeting and hospi-
tality. What time Mr. W. Cooke lounged on the
cushions of the House of Reps., he employed a
monocle with which to inspect brother babblers—
an aid to the vision these same heartily disliked.
Miss Ivy Clarke had her final fling in short
frocks and flying locks, last week, when she hosted
it at a limited knickerbocker party. The damsel
is to be seriously ordained a grown-up in Cup-
weelc, which is a favored time for “coming
out.” So many people are “ out” at the end of a
Gee-Gee Carnival.
Mrs. Wesley Hall has been taking a little notice
again. The neat little widow isn’t making any
profuse display of her riches, so Toorak gets the
notion that she must suffer from dyspepsia or
something. Nothing of the kind. Mrs. Hall is a
robust little party, but the society whirligig
doesn’t attract her. That’s all about it.
Retired Judge Casey has the festive flag once
more braving the bottle and the lees on St. Hilda
esplanade, the pensioned Solomon having just
returned from Colombo. Within ten days of his
returning he put up a record of seven dinners and
lunches at his mansion, and still the table squeaks
(the modern table never groans) with cates set out
with hospitable intent.
Irish crochet is Miss Nellie Stewart’s latest fad.
Turquoises, cameos and diamonds are neglected
for the collection of crochet. A skilful worker has
just completed a dress in crochet for Nell. Mrs.
Brown-Potter, by the way, had a costly collection
of Irish crochets.
Rupert Clarke has been holding the top box at
the Princess’ of late in company with Julius
Knight who, by a merciful social law, can’t flaunt
his person in butcher blue tailorings of evenings.
Typhoid has added a slight air of pensiveness to
Knight’s heaviest posings.
Since Mummer Osborne took Miss Maud Jef-
fries in marriage to his clan, they have been
indulging in much praise and pretty avowals
of delight. An actress in a family of much
sheep and sinew is such a novelty. Even
the Maddens, distantly related, are" gushful.
Mrs. Osborne takes all the fuss with a distrait air
and a touch of tired unconcern. Her accustomed
outdoor pallor gets never a touch of powder or
rose-dab. This undiluted, blameless, refined
pallor is admired as a courageous and noble art of
beauty in itself. The lady who stars as a beauty
on the boards is deemed brave to show up in the
fierce light of day minus the dabs that delude.
Many a sweet frank girleen has gone over to false
eyebrows and a moveable glow of cream and roses
just because her friends dubbed her “beauty,”
and she felt she had to try and live up to the
reputation even if she had to be a Chemical Flora
to do it.
After her Philharmonic tootle next month Miss
Eileen Castles is to keep her rather metallic voice
in pickle till the end of this financial year, when
she takes up her travelling kit to trip it with the
Royal Comics. This third aspirant of the boomed
family is a somewhat lighter edition of sister Amy
as to appearance and manner, and, of course, she
is more stage-struck. Amy, the founder of the
family, is likely to be the last to arrive on the
operatic stage. The eldest brother, now in the
Agent-General’s office in Fogtown, also itches, ’tis
understood, to be footing it in the Williamson
ranks, and expects a call in due course.
A Holy City bachelor who runs a motor and
skates like _an ice-nymph is regarded as the
accepted suitor of a coy little theatrical star,
fairly new to the footlights and the grease.
Miss Vida Goldstein, the other night, ran a
corroboree at the Austral Salon, to which all the
ladies of the Political Association flocked in
assorted clothes. Senator Dobson and Rep.
Hughes furnished the pros and cons of a Union
Label debate, Miss Vida as referee. The Tas-
manian Senator overstepped the time limit, and
the perky referee promptly pulled him up and de-
livered him over to the caustic tongue of Hughes.
Another globe-trotter returns with the verdict
that Australian theatrical shows are up to any,
and past many, put on in the more important
London play-houses. The theatre-goer in ques-
tion saw “ The Cingalee ” in the Fog City, and he
prefers the Australian production, principally
owing to the melodious chorus. The voices ot
our cherubim, he says, sound ever fresh, hopeful,
and joyous. “ There is an exuberance in the very
quality of the voices of a comic opera chorus this
side that is not to be found in even Italy, Ger-
many, or France ! ”
While on voices—Miss Mary Conly, the comely
soprano who warbled herself into matrimony and
travel, has been spending three years in close
study under the evergreen Madame Minna
Fischer. No cables have loomed in the press
anent the triumphs of this little Mary, but recent
files disclose the fact that at several concerts in or
about the City of Fog, Miss Conly was pro-
grammed by the side of Ada Crossley, and praise
was apportioned both in equal terms. I saw one
criticism that spread most of the marmalade over
Miss Conly. yhe is the matronly-figured young
Melbournienne of whom it was said at the time of
the first Castles boom that she was better worth
booming than the lucky one.
Managers Tait have had some troubles with the
pianist Borschke’s hair; and a pianist’s hair is his
glory and his surest grip on the box office. The
musical youth arrived with lank hair—long, not
lovely, but still artistic. They thought he’d do
nicely, but to their horror the Hungarian beauty
broke away and found a coiffeur who guaranteed
to give the hair sufficient curl to last the first
concert out. Now curled hair is not in it, as a
springe to catch audiences, with long straight hair,
so one of the brethren showed the young man
round a gallery of musicians, and stopped before

“ I endured years of fearful suffer-

violent pains and distress in my
stomach, risings of wind after eating,
poor appetite and extreme debility

for the moment. Often I was quite

About 18 months ago I read of
Mother Seigel’s Syrup. I bought a

discover that it helped me at once.
I began to eat fairly well and gained

unprepared shoulder of a short young local
violinist and pressed a motherly, or elder-sisterly,
kiss on his top curl—-a modest little curl that had
never been kissed before.
Miss Stirling (whom everyone talks tenderly of
as “ Maggie”) appeared for her introductory con-
cert at the Town Hall in fine oyster raiment, with
a slip-panel down the front of crystal splinters
that illumined the rest of her. More of the splin-
ters, in glistening heaps, bordered the corsage,
and were as a foil to the high and heavy white
shoulders. The Dowager of Cliveden sat straight
up in the forward pew, with the large Stirling
bairns on either side of her own lambs —a spectacle
which evoked much sympathetic approval.
Miss Ethel Sinclair has grown plump since she
sailed off from this port with the Clarke scholar-
ship, her aspirations and her sweet-toned fiddle.
She made a re-appearance at the Stirling concert,
and was warmly received. But her style is not
that of a captivating gadder or artful traveller.
She is simply stout and energetic, with brain
to back her fiddling and a saving dash of tem-
perament.
There was a big roll-up to Toorak House last
week for the Show of Stitchery, set going for the
impaired gentlewomen by Mrs. Edward Miller.
Folks went in party rig and carrying chatelaine
purses for emergency purposes. Sovereigns
passed hands briskly as soon as the Work
Association delegates started to deal. Before
the golden noon was far advanced all the
leading exhibits were labelled “ Sold.” Mrs.
Miller took a regal view of the bazaar havoc
in her blessed mansion, garbed in committee
black, the glace of which broke into a lace diver-
sion here and there with encouraging effect. One
of the most summery of smart frockers among the
guests was the red-haired Miss Brodribb, in cream
with one of the approved tag-and-tear silk boas.
An Adelaide correspondent writes :
The W.C.T.U. is having its annual useless pow-wow in
the Holy City. The Union is divided into as many de-
partments as there are mortal sins. During the year Mrs.
Stiggins prowls round with a oat’s-eye lantern, and the
“bloke "who tells sweet nothings to his Sal in the city
parks is disturbed by the aforesaid glimmer on Saturday
nights. She invades bars, and thrusts a pile of uninterest-
ing literature between the thirsty man and his beer.
Annually there is a great corroboree. The head of the
“ Morals ” branch retails her record of timely interrup-
tions, and the chiefs of the various departments recite
their deeds of squalor. These people make a plain citizen
tired and ill.
Yiolet-picking has been a midwinter amuse-
ment. And it’s not quite done yet. There’s a
nursery out Malvern way boasting a boundless
outlook of violet beds. For a small church coin,
one gathers as many blossoms as is possible with-
out contracting a backache.
Claude Bantock relieves the toilsomeness of
looking funny in comic opera by bantam raising.
He’s a fowl-fancier of renown and understood
his fame as a chicken-hatcher, the other night,
when a prize bantam was handed up to him over
the trombone man, in “ The Cingalee.” But surely
there should be a veto on this sort of thin,
aggressive nonsense. Otherwise the action of the
drama will be presently delayed whilst Lauri is
presented with a milch cow, or a tame crocodile, or
a real joke, or some other strange animal. I
know a man, by the way, who speaks feelingly
of these things. Years ago, when he was young
and harmless, some villainous friends banquetted
him and gave him the best part of an alleged
gold mine in scrip. When the 14th call happened
he realised that it was the only way they could
get rid of a dead investment—a very dead one
indeed.
From the way the massage parlors and Turkish
baths are being patronised, it seems that the local
she intends to be quite clean for the summer. “Let
me be clean ” ! is a common male cry, but till re-
cently it hasn’t been echoed with enthusiasm by the
second sex. The rush to the Turkish t’other day
was more than the attendants could cope with, al-
though the baths are available for women every day
of the week. In the hot-house of highest tem-
perature simmering Venuses, run to flesh, prome-
naded, recounting to one another the story of
their gradual avoirdupois, and swapping anti-
fat diets. Between the steady showers of perspi-
ration, other elderly Junos exchanged family
histories and maternal sighs.
The Norman Bayles have come back, covered
with dust and glory, from a motor-spin through
the other States. It hasn’t yet transpired
whether the beauteous Bayles conveyed any
specially-canned cornflowers on the tour to keep
up a supply that would furnish him with a fresh
buttonhole at every port of call. Hardly possible
that he went for more than one day without his
blue blossom.
The Dante Society is agitated now to fever
point over the coming of an Italian Princelet in
early November. But his nibs comes for the Cup
carnival, and it will probably be “his troubles”
about Dante.
Eloquent silence, or the brief word that has a
more biting snap, are the only comments passed
upon the arrangements of a Federal dame, who
divided her friends into two sections, feasting the
better half one day, and the lesser on another
occasion. The lists are being discussed, and those
set down in the second-hand lot snort violently.
The recent show of Purr, Yelp and Twitter
suggests that the cult of pussie is of a rather
plebeian order, that doggie is a fashionable
craze, and that the feathered chirper is the coming
pet. The Stonington dame’s whistling exercises
at the cage of Pretty Joey have set the suburban
Miss tuning up her surplus breath to do likewise,
and she is now practising on the chooky-hen with
great success.
Curio-dealers and crest-gatherers have lately been
up on the door-mat of the Grand waiting on P. S.
Mitchell, the interesting bachelor of the Table
Top squattocracy. He has some fine curios,
among them miniatures dating back pretty well
to the Flood, or the megatharium, or some other
old time. Rare ivories are another strong feature
of his treasures.
The second annual street collection in Adelaide
for the Children’s Hospital brought in £555
—£s2 less than last year. The wife of Chief
Justice Way (with a fine “pitch” at the corner
of King William and Rundle streets) was top-
scorer with £5B; a fashionable doctor’s wife
second with £5O ; and the Mayoress next with
£49. One £5 note was taken, and £75 in gold and
paper, but most people simply laid in a stock of
small change for the occasion. There were 9000
threepennies garnered in, and a staggering weight
of 12,409 pennies; also, 1816 frugal souls got
down to halfpence. There were no farthings.
Hebrewdom in Melbourne gathered at the
Bourke-street Synagogue, last week, to consecrate
anew the building, defiled by the rude hand of
the Board of Health. Feminine Jewry, perched
in the galleries outside the congregation, showed
a gallant display of furs and diamonds. One
Chosen daughter, who hung over the clock in
a rakish black hat, had planted “just there”
a diamond gaud that caught a ray from every
gas-jet, and the jets number 120. Melbourne
Jewesses are pretty, as a rule—some of them very
pretty. Mayor Pleasance sat in a place of honor,
trying to look comfortable with his hat on in
church. (That Jewish custom is a good one ; with-
out it the proscribed sex would see from the gallery
only a published surface of bald pate.) Chief-Secre-
tary Sammy Gillott pulled his velvet collar round
his ears and looked the most venerable Abraham
of them all. He gladdened the heart of Israel
with a gift of 10 guineas. Little Dr. Maloney
came late in a slouch hat, and slid into a vacant
seat beside Alderman Pratt, M.L.C., who remained
as starched a Tory as was possible under the circum-
stances. The consecration business was a mysterious
ceremony that looked like one of Prof. Spencer’s
Centralian biograph-films. Rabbi Abrahams
headed a procession of nine Jewish gentlemen,
who marched round the church seven times, carry-
ing sacred totems wrapped in calico bags. At the
same time a fresh and powerful choir made
melodious remarks in Hebrew. Handsome
Miss Schlam sang a sweet sacred solo later
on. After more ceremonies in Old-Testament
language, Rabbi Abrahams mounted the white
stone steps of the Ark, and Gentiles waited
anxiously to see him slaughter a goat, or a
bullock, or some other animal. But it seems
that business is long out of date. The
daughters of Israel in the gallery did not
waste their glances on plump, big-voiced Father
Abrahams. Rachel and Leah (as of yore) are now
talking of an unmarried stranger from a far country
—the new priest who began his duties in a seaside
suburb only a week ago. He intoned one of the
prayers at the consecration, and at every third
word his large, dark eye was raised, to send a
thrill through the gallery.
A pack of fashionables saw the start of “ His
Majesty’s Servant” on Saturday, and used their
glasses with feverish anxiety on the convalescent
mummer of the legs. He showed a close cut of
thatch which caused the thought of the senti-
mentally - mashed to hark back pensively
to the time when Julius’ pulse was alarming.
There were four acts in the piece, and at
every curtain-fall Julius was bellowed for and
appeared several times to bow his shaven head to
the gushers, most of whom were of the she-variety.
Miss Jeffries had only to look the Puritan Maid,
and she looked it in two or three changes of
raiment, that of pearl satin being of most
picturesque account. Miss Florence Hamer
displayed a great depth of chest and a col-
lection of light little liquorice ringlets in her
role as semi-royal villainess, also some gems
of dazzlesome quality. Her nervousness took the
edge off half her devilry. The mummer herself
admits to being the most nervous subject that
ever followed the game. She tells how her knees
collide in trembly stage moments, and her hand
has to clutch some of the scenery to save her
words knocking each other out of all recognition.
The rotund Thomas Bent had a look in at “ The
J.P.” on the farewell night, and shook his side of
the circle with his rolling laughter every time the
giddy honorary magistrate bumped down the stairs,
in a drunken somnambulist act, or was cold-
shouldered by the cheeky little widow of his affec-
tions. Thomas Bent likes his farce with the sauce
thick, and regards it with his working specs,
lodged high on his bump of candor.
A little dazzler of Melbourne origin but
Harborville court interest makes her first appear-
ance before Princess’ eyes in the ranks of “ His
Majesty’s Servant.” Though rather small-
featured for a great effect, she shines as the
pick of the Court beauties.
Mrs. M'Cracken, who died last week, was one
of the great old identities of early Flemington.
Her fine residence looks across from a belt of elms
at the equally fine eyrie of the Maddens, and both
properties represent big interest and big wealth.
The old lady enjoyed an income of £BOOO a year,
and lived a rather strenuous life to the last. Out
of ten or eleven children, only one survived —
Alec, the sport and brewer, who is one of the big
property men of the Glenroy and Essendon dis-
tricts.
That kilted curiosity—Jacobite Napier—who for
years was a familiar figure in this State, is on his
way back to Melbourne after a period of resi-
dence on his native heath. He brings an eligible
daughter from Scotland, and will look once more
to his Collins-street property with a purely busi-
ness eye. The inveterate Scot doesn’t allow his
vast money interests to suffer from the propaganda
of the Fiery Cross, or the declaration of Mary the
Somethingth as the real monarch of Britain.

A N.S.W. Equity Court case heard the
other day ought to make several people uncom-
fortable. It was another of Tom Slattery’s little
affairs. While acting as solicitor and agent for
Mrs. Scanlon in the investment of her Tyson
money, Slattery had accepted £2OO from one Kin-
nane, who sold five Rand wick houses through him.
Now Mrs. Scanlon sued Kinnane to get the money
back and to have the sale-contract rescinded ; and
the Chief Judge in Equity made the decree asked
for, though Mrs. Scanlon is to get back not £lO,OOO
but £9ooo—the odd £lOOO being apparently some
sort of compensation to Kinnane for standing out
of the chance of selling his property during the
five years since the Scanlon sale was made. It
wasn’t, in spite of this decree, a particularly bad
case either. In fact, the Court said that Kinnane
believed Mrs. Scanlon agreed to Slattery taking
his money. If the Court rescinds a contract made
under those circumstances, there shouldn’t be
much doubt as to what it would do in a case where
the second commission was admittedly a secret
affair—a bribe, in fact, given by the seller to the
man whom the buyer was paying for looking after
his interests. And if the seller could afford to pay
the buyer’s agent something, it proves that he
could afford to sell for less. But the morals of the
thing haven’t been in question all along ; the inte-
resting fact at present is that the Equity Court
has made an appearance at last in defence of
morality, and has fallen heavily on the secret com-
mission by squelching the bargain of the man who
paid it.
Tommy Bent and his Ministry were only
saved from smash over their Sunday train
eccentricity by a swift appeal to the fount of
wisdom. And again the right brand—D.C.L. —
saved the situation. Thus once more does the
Whisky of the Wise justify its being chosen by
Australia as the national brand. It sets the
foolish on the main line of common sense and
keeps them there—if they continue to take it
regularly. One may say of the D.C.L. drinker
that he i 3 “ no fool.”*
Sydney Telegraph, in its new “Ladies’
Page, ” prints this from a London paper :
Australia depends on money borrowed from England,
and the interest of that money is almost all spent in Eng-
land. The D’Arcys and the Wilsons do not spend their
money in Queensland and New South Wales, but in
Grosvenor-square. No country can thrive under such
conditions. No colony, in fact, has ever come to much,
or ever will do so.
When the Telegraph prints things like this,
what prevents it advocating forthwith the obvious
remedy—an absentee-tax ?
“T.D.” : However the monopolist English
press, and the syndicated Australian variety,
struggle to conceal the fact, there is a growing
uneasiness in the minds of British statesmen and
leaders of political thought as to the wisdom of
helping the Monkey to swing on the top branch.
I have lately been in the way of meeting a good
many front-rank politicians and writers, and the
subject of Australia has inevitably brought them
round to the prospects of that far-away land when
the Jap has quite finished with the Bear, and has
sufficiently rested himself to take on some more
fight. This fact in itself shows what fears are
shaping themselves, and even the more Tory
minds are willing to admit that the question of
Jap interference with British interests somewhere
in the Pacific is bound to crop up. And then
Australia will have to look out. As a former
junior member of a British Cabinet remarked to
me the other day, “ You have, of course, an
essentially Japanese industry in the pearl-shelling,
and that fact alone might at any time provide an
excuse for a conflict, which is really sought for
other reasons entirely. Of course I’m not thinking
of to-day or to-morrow, but it doesn’t take many
years or many months to alter an international
position, and the more Japanese you have in
Australia the bigger chance there will be of
eventual trouble. By all means keep them out,
and by doing so you’ll probably be saving some
future British Government a devil of a lot of
trouble.”
“Pot” on the subject of Bent, Boyd,
bricks, coal, locomotives, &c. :
I am not an admirer of Victoria’s Premier Bent, yet I
cannot but sympathise with that curious compound of
humanity at times. Bent has ideas of starting State
brick works. Boyd and others of that ilk condemn thi»
as an interference with “private enterprise.” Boyd wants
his coal used on the State railways to encourage “ private
enterprise.” If Bent proposed to run his own State coal
mine Boyd and Co. would again cry out like a cat on the
roof that “private enterprise” was being grievously
molested. The Employers’ Federation (which includes
the aforesaid Boyd), in its annual report (Argus, 22/8/‘O5),
denounces the State brick works as being a means of provid-
ing “ Government stroke ” billets. The Royal Commission
report on locomotive construction at the Phoenix Foundry
and the Newport State workshops finds the cost of
making all engines to be £477 less at the Government
shops, of which saving half (£238) represents economy in
wages. Now if Boyd and other employers are honest in
their objection to Bent interfering with “ private enter-
prise,” why do they let their annual report say that the
“Government-stroke” brickworks are objectionable?
Their “ private stroke” should soon beat the other kind.
And what on earth is wrong with the private stroke in
loco.-building that it can’t keep up with the State stroke?
And if the State workshops can save £lB,OOO or £20,000 in
building £150,000 worth of locomotives, there is a danger
to Boyd that it may try if it can’t make a similar saving
by running its own pits to provide coal for the engines
when built. And then it may cease to subsidise Boyd’s
“ private enterprise,” which isn’t really private, being
subsidised. Then Boyd will probably take a fit, and it
w'ould be just like him to go and have his fit in Bent’s
electorate.
The Chinese love of a flutter was more
than satisfied by the cheerful gamble between
Lionel Terry and Chun Yung, in Haining-street,
Wellington (Maoriland), last Sunday night.
Chun didn’t know he was gambling for his
life when he stepped forth into the smellful
thoroughfare, and his luck was right out.
Lionel Terry, a young man from Eton and Oxford,
had travelled and seen the evil wrought in every
part of the wide British Empire by the inflow of
the colored alien. He had brooded over the
matter, and written a book, entitled “ The
Shadow of the Empire,’’ in which he strove to
arouse his fellow white Britons to the
danger of the taint. But the Briton didn’t
seem to get any wiser, and Terry, who had
become, apparently, a monomaniac, decided that
something drastic must be done to arouse public
interest in the matter. So he wrote to M.L.
Governor Plunket that in order to draw attention
t) the evil he had determined to kill the first China-
man he met in Haining-street on Sunday night. He
had no personal malice against any colored brother,
and didn’t single out any individual. He left it
to the Fates to decide who should die for the
Empire’s good, and Chun Yung walked along,
and was promptly shot. Then Terry went home,
had supper, passed a good night, and after break-
fast next morning called round and gave himself
up. Now his book will probably sell like ripe
cherries.

Now there’s talk of land scandals in New
Guinea.
_ Has anyone heard recently from those
N.S.W. unemployed whom Premier Carruthers
sent out at public expense to hunt rabbits and
specks of gold ?
“ There are two anti-Australian parties in
Australia—the Stinking Fish party and the Dirty
Bird party. The Opposition belongs to them

The exact words which Wi Pere, the Maori

When a S. Australian civil servant was
promoted from the Audit to the Attorney-Gene-

his new salary would be £2OO per year. It also
heard that lie had been in the service 23 years.
Good old John Stinson writes to the
Sydney papers proposing that £5,000,000 should be
borrowed to open up the North Coast districts of
N. Is there any blessed “reformer” in all
N.S.W. who doesn’t want to begin his reform by
floating another big loan?
Sudden Solomon is moving in the S.A.
Assembly to put the Northern Territory under

The N.S.W. Government having screwed
up its courage to give a contract for pig-iron made

A lamentation from Cameron, M.H.R.,

The inevitable yapping trinity :
Mr. Joseph Cook (N.S. W T .): There was the six hatters

Air. Wilks (N.S.W.): And the six potters case.
Mr. Kellv (N.S.W.): And the Petriana scandal.
Also there is the Joe Cook obstruction blight, and

car nuisance.
“ W.” wades in to spoil another fellow’s
joke with dreary particulars :
In Tiib Bulletin (14/9/’O5), in a paragraph concerning
Speaker Coles of the S.A. Assembly, you remark that he
“ adjusted his blown horse hair.” Be it known unto you
fehat the S.A. Speaker does not wear a wig. Neither is
there a mace nor any functionary in knee breeches to
hang round and look pretty connected with the
Assembly. There is no legislative body in the Common-
wealth which has less “pomp and ceremony ” about it.
William M‘Millan, importer, the gentle-
man who stayed in the Australian Parliament till
ha had got the tariff fixed up, as far as possible, to
destroy Australian industries for the benefit of the
importing business, and then resigned and left the
country to its fate, lately addressed a meeting at
Manilla (N.S.W.), and, according to the daily
Eaper report, “ spoke disparagingly of those mem-
ers who entered Parliament with the. object of
self-elevation.”
It is a rather re-
markable circumstance
that Canada, which
hardly produces any
silver, is allowed to
mint its own silver
coin, to retain the
profits, and even to
repudiate the responsi-
bility of keeping its
own silver coinage in
repair; while Australia,
which is a vast silver-
producing country,
hasn’t managed even
to get the right of
coining 6d. for itself.
Also, A ustralia pays
£200,000 a year towards
the British navy and is
only reviled in Eng-
land for its pains,
while Canada pays
nothing, gets a far
better defence, and is
almost grovelled to by
the British person.
The Owe’Sullivan
built a railway from
Culcairn toGermanton
(N.S.W.), and occasion-
ally it is found more or
less worth while to run
a train along it. The
Australian Govern-
ment wanted the train
to carry the mails ; but
the State asked such a
price that the Aus-
tralian Government
hesitated, and while it
hesitated a private per-
son j umped in with an
offer to carry the mails
oftener, and as rapidly,
for about half the
money; and so the
train crawls along three
times a week, and a
coach whips up beside
the track every day,
and often does the dis-
tance in as good time,
and sometimes better. If there hadn’t been a
coach handy the Post-office would have had to pay
the exorbitant price demanded by the State ; and
then when the figures were published, the State,
in the person of J. Carruthers, would have made
crushing remarks about Federal extravagance.
The S.A. Legislative Council is girding up
its expensive loins to throw out the Price Govern-
ment’s progressive land-tax scheme. But it is in
an awkward position, for if it rejects the pro-
posed graduated tax, which only charges |d. in
the £ up to £5OOO, it will be necessary to per-
petuate the existing rate, which is Id. right
through. Then the man with £5OOO worth of land
will be bitterly angry at losing the chance to get
rid of half his tax, and the “ producer” will want
to throw the hard, bitter turnip of execration at
his M.L.C.
Senator Playford’s statement that the
Government “wanted to get a High Commis-
sioner, but they did not know whether they could
succeed,” has given rise to a good deal of discus-
sion among Federal members He could hardly
have intended to suggest any real difficulty in
securing a Commissioner, considering the number
of candidates in the field. One idea is that the
Government is pledged to Bigjohn Forrest, and is
prepared to drop the measure sooner than yield to
the opposition freely expressed re his appoint-
ment. If that is so, better no High Commissioner
than Bigjohn Forrest, but The Bulletin can’t
credit the yarn.
Some important matters crop up when
men are making laws for the government of a
country. The other day, in the Tasmanian
Assembly, it was decided that a Bill should be
brought in for the protection of the homing
pigeon. It seems as though it would be more
profitable and practical to talk about the reasons
why Tasmania’s population is decreasing, and
why departures from the island have exceeded
arrivals pretty consistently for the last 45 years,
than to discuss Bills for the protection of pigeons
or the establishment of homes for superannuated
canaries—Bills which will probably be thrown
out, in any case, when sent to the Loft or House
of Dodery, where those who ought to be angels
roost.
The mentally-unwieldy Landlords of
Victoria put up a great fight over the sacred rights
of property, which they chose to imagine the
State had attacked by ensuring—by the Water
Bill —its right touse its own water. Metaphorically
they got them into the last ditch and wallowed
heavily and pounded the mire of illogical argument
with much puffing and spluttering. Finally
Manifold quoted scripture—“ Cursed be he who
removes his neighbor’s landmark,” but Attorney
General Davies was full weary of obstruction by
this time and flung back the retort, “ But Moses
commanded a redistribution of the land every 50
years,” and there was no more scripture.
Sample of debate from the House of
Representatives :
G. Wilson (speaking on the Commerce Bill) : “ The Bill
is not an effective one.”
Webster : “ In what is it defective ? ”
Spence : “ Hear, hear 1 ”
Webster : “ Show us the defects.”
Spence : “ Hear, hear.”
G. Wilson (with the air of a pompous parrot): “It is
the business of the Government to put before the House
an effective Bill.”
Spence : “ Just so 1 just so ! ”
Webster : “ Hear, hear ! ”
It is a very simple job to be a great statesman
when you come to think of it.
The High Court has had a fling at the
land laws of N.S.W., and has despairingly
declared, by way of obiter dicta, that “it is im-
possible to construe them ; you have to find your
way through them.” And a thorny way it is.
The N.S.W. land enactments have grown up like
a blackfellows’ camp, higgledy-piggledy. Every
Ministry has had a member anxious to leave his
footprint on the dust of Time (and, incidentally,
to secure his seat; and, in some cases, to secure
an even more tangible reward) by passing “a
comprehensive Land Act ” ; and the final result
is that the land law is so comprehensive as to be
incomprehensible. Yet it would be quite a
feasible thing to codify all the conflicting and con-
current statutes into one Land Act, and ask
Parliament to ratify that and sweep all the old
lumber away. But there is only hard work and
no prospect of profit or credit in such a course.
Therefore it isn’t adopted.
POLITICAL PATRIOTISM.
In re some recent criticisms by Australian Parliamen-
tarians of Australian people and Australian laws.
AUSTRALIA : “At least I might he spared this
kind of thing at the hands of my own servants
in my own House.”
Sydney D.T., Sept. 25 :
A Temporary Supply Bill on Tuesday in the House of
Representatives will afford an opportunity for some
general criticism. . . . The House has had sufficient en-
lightenment now on the slipshod methods in which the
Government’s business is prepared to make any schemes
for the restricting of debate and suppressing criticism im-
possible. .
Thus is the wild Wilks, with the flowing Smiths
(Pumpkin and Bruce), and the clamorous Conroy,
and Kelly and co., urged to get up and obstruct.
One great trouble and permanent misery
of the Australian Government lies in the fact that
it is hardly possible for it to propose a public work
in any State without members from at least two
other States objecting because the work isn’t in
their State, and, as every work must be in some
State, it is difficult to do anything without bitter
parochial howls arising. It is hard to imagine
anything that is more likely to pay 20 per cent,
on its cost than the proposed telephone from Mel-
bourne to Sydney, yet even that roused Senator
Matheson, of Westralia, to complaints about
“expensive luxuries” ; and he found three other
aggravated persons in the Senate to support him.
Nearly a century ago a N.S.W. bench of
magistrates struggled with
the trading difficulty that is
at the bottom of the present
union-label controversy, and
solved it in a way. Union-
ism, as we now know it,
didn’t exist then, but there
was roguery as we now
know it—light weight, adul-
teration, and so forth. The
magistrates decided that the
best way to make sure of
catching the fraudulent
maker—the man originally
responsible was to force
him to put his label on each
article. The following is the
regulation they drew up in
regard to bread :
That each and every baker shall mark each and every
loaf he exposes for sale with the initials of his or their
respective names.
That regulation was signed by Ellis Bent,
Alexander Riley, D’Arcy Wentworth and S.
Ford, and was approved by Governor Macquarie
in June, 1810.
Queensland has constructed a railway to
the imaginary line which divides Banana]and
from N.S.W., and the work comes to a sudden
stop a few hundred yards from the Tweed River.
Permission has been asked from Carruthers to
make a short extension at Queensland’s cost, in
order to save bother and expense to the
N.S.W. dwellers on the river in hauling them-
selves and their goods from the water to the rail-
way. But Carruthers, who insists that the Tweed
River trade must be dragged all the way to Syd-
ney, has refused. An extension of this line would
greatly enrich the N.S.W. people up North by
giving them access to a market close at hand, but
it wouldn’t benefit the traders in far-off Sydney,
and trade must be dragged to Sydney even if it
should burst on the road.
President Moore, at the annual meeting of
the N.S.W. Employers’ Federation, cursed the
Arbitration law, and said that what they wanted
was for “ masters and men ” to come together and
put the settlement of their industrial troubles on a
“solid foundation.” Well, haven’t they? How
much more solid than the law of the land do they
want the foundations to be ? Or do they want the
foundations so solid that one party or the other
can slip away when it reckons that it can get
better terms by fighting than by staying and
arguing—as the Broken Hill mining co. ’s did 10
years ago when they tore up the “ solid ’’ agree-
ment, and told the men that if they wanted any-
thing they could fight for it ? The beauty of that
sort of “ solid foundation ” is that it’s there when
it isn’t wanted, and it isn’t there when it is wanted.
Henniker Heaton, the rich Australian
absentee, has again been circularising this country
about the desirability of a penny post between
Australia and the land where Henniker spends
the money that Australia supplies him with, and
where he hopes some day to get a title and become
Lord ’Enniker. But the loss to Australia, if it
complied with Henniker’s request and supplied
Henniker with his desired advertisement, would
be about £250,000 a year. The said £250,000 a
year would be much better spent in paying off the
3| per cent, bonds which bind us to England than
in forging the new bond of a penny post. As a
matter of fact, Australia wants less communica-
tion with England rather than more. This country
is in much greater need of manufactures of its
own than of a penny post to enable it to order
tweed and chiffons from J. Bull.
The Victorian Cabinet nearly split the
other day. Minister Swinburne was pushing
through his Milk Supervision Bill, under which
those local bodies which have persistently refused
to carry out the law, by keeping dairies clean and
by prosecuting people who poison the public with
dirty and diseased milk, are to have the power of
conniving at wholesale murder taken out of their
hands. Irving and Livingston proposed as an
amendment that they should have another chance
to wink at wholesale murder so long as they
“promised to reform.” Swinburne said “No”
with the emphasis of a long thin man who meant
business. Bent said “Yes” with the hesitancy
of a short thick man who was half-persuaded.
Then there was a hurried adjournment of the
debate. When the Bill came up again it proved
that the cause of Bent, Irvine, Livingston and
Dirt had gone down badly after a fierce private
discussion, and Swinburne was on top.
The S. Australian Railway Commissioner
gave away another part of the show in his annual
report, issued the other day. The net revenue was
said to be £536,530, or £3 19s. per cent, on capital,
“ which means that, after paying working expenses
and interest on capital, £67,800 was carried to the
credit of profit and loss”-—and that surplus was
promptly collared by the Treasurer to make his
surplus with. Then the Commissioner cheerfully
knocked out both surpluses with this remark: —
I regret some portion of this sum was not appropriated
in the further reduction of the amount due to capital for
condemned railway stock.
In other words, the balance-sheet is faked, con-
demned rolling-stock being included in the assets;
and if the honest thing were done, and the rail-
ways were charged with the things they wore
out, then there wouldn’t be any such railway
surplus at all, and the Treasurer wouldn’t
have a surplus either, and the need for the pro-
proposed heavier land-tax would be greater than
ever. It’s a shocking thing to reflect that all S.
Australia has to show for its alleged surplus is
several cwt. of rust and numerous tons of rotten
timber.
The N.S.W. Government has at last fixed
up a contract for the supply of locally-produced
steel and iron. It will cost a little more than the
imported article, but Carrutbers reckons the
extra cost is fully justified because—
This means the establishment of the largest manufac-
turing industry in the whole of Australia. The complete
figures will be submitted to Parliament in a few days by
Mr. Lee. Taking the prices of the last five years, with
freight included, the tender works out an increase in the
rates to the extent of between 6 and 7 per cent, but
against that increase there are many good relative
advantages. The chief one is that there will be more
work for the railways in the carriage of raw material to
the place of manufacture, and the freight on that alone
will amount to about £140,000 per annum. Of course
that will not all be profit, but a portion of that is the
profit to the railways, over and above working expenses.
It also means more employment on the lines. Perhaps
too optimistic statements were put forward some time
ago as to the effect of the establishment of this industry
in the direction of employment. It has been said that
work would be found for 11,000 men, but I don’t think
the industry will give employment to so large a number.
It will, however, undoubtedly mean work for thousands
of persons, directly or indirectly.
All of which is very good Protectionist argument,
though what a Freetrader like Carruthers is doing
with it heaven only knows.
THE DISUNITED UNION.
The State Premiers are said to be uniting to oppose the
appointment of a Federal High Commissioner in London.
Most of them want to retain six Agents-General as at
present.
The National Ass in S. A. shows some sign
of weakening in its antagonism to an extended
franchise for the Legislative Council, and at the
recent annual meeting the platform was modified
and the “no surrender” flag hauled down. Ex-
Lands Minister “Turncoat Bill” Copley suggested
an educational qualification, but blatant leaguers
protested that ‘ ‘ parsons and school teachers are
the worst enemies of the propertied classes ” and
that some of the worst Socialists “ are highly edu-
cated men.” So the intelligence test was promptly
rejected. The Ass doesn't want intelligence ; it
wants bray.

“ Yarrum ” : JRe drink, and the craving for
it. T’other Saturday at Catherine Hill Bay, I
met a young miner whom I’d known at Mt.
Kembla. He was stepping out for the pit for all
he was worth, although there was no work there.
Had had a drunk on pay-night (Friday), and he
explained that he was anxious to get into the pit,
and get a sniff of it to kill the craving for the
“ cursed derrink ’’ that was gnawing at his vitals.
He hadn’t the price of two drinks about him, so
we went in together. Since then an old miner
told me that there is “something in the atmo-
sphere below that stifles the desire for liquor and
steadies the nerves,” and acts on the system same
as a pick-me-up.
‘ ‘ Stony ” : There is in Hobart one place
at least where the traveller can put up, at hotel
rates, if he doesn’t care to go to a hotel. But,
unlike the hotels, this house provides an extra
which doesn’t appear in the bill. A Melbourne
man slept there one night, and, during the even-
ing, among the soap and candles and towels and
things in his 6xß, he came across a Bible, which he
supposed had been left behind by the previous
occupier. After breakfast, next day, when about
to leave the palace, he took the book downstairs
and handed it over the office-counter and ex-
plained. The manager regarded him for a moment
with a grieved and reproving eye, and then said,
as he reached across for the stranger’s money,
“ There is one in every room, sir.” And sniffed.
“ Pot Luck ” writes :
Public school teachers’ shifts in N.S. W. seem to be con.
trolled in a haphazard sort of way that would indicate
that the Department is very much out of touch with the
individual conditions of its officers. Frinstance, a teacher
with lung weakness pegs away for years with a petition
for removal to a drier climate, while at the other end of
the district is a man who hates a dry climate, who holds
the same certificate and class of school, and whose peti-
tion to be removed to some place like Fogville is yellow
with age and venerableness. Doctors’ certificates count
as nothing, and when at last both sufferers are pretty
well decomposed, the exchange is made. But it comes
quite by chance, and three weeks and five days of the
summer vacation are allowed to pass before the parties
are instructed to take charge respectively on the following
Monday. Then comes the rough-and-tumble of auction
sale, to say nothing of the sacrifice in cash caused by
having to clear out at a moment’s notice and leave
matters for the wife to fix up. Shifts should he effected
during first week of the vacations.


A Bad Taste in the Mouth
Indicates a Foul Stomach. Cleanse the-
Ststem by Taking a Few Doses of Db.
Moese’s Indian Root Pills.
A bad taste in the mouth is the result of con-
centration or precipitation of fumes arising from
a sour stomach, while sleeping, forming a coating
on the tongue and the roof of the mouth. This is
more frequently experienced when waking in the
morning after a restless night. The mouth feels-
clogged and the throat thick with phlegm. You
expectorate, but you cannot get rid of the taste.
You have probably eaten some indigestable food;
before retiring which has become putrid in the
stomach. Cleanse your stomach at once and save
further complications. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills will thoroughly cleanse the stomach, promote
digestion, and tone the system. A couple of
these pills taken occasionally before retiring will
regulate the system perfectly, and prevent a bad:
taste in the mouth in the morning.*

The V.A.T.C. handicapper has practically
tipped Marvel Loch for the Caulfield Cup by allotting- too
weight to the N.S.W. mare for the Toorak Handicap and
asking her to concede pounds to several nags that will
have to give her a considerable lump in the longer race.
There is, for instance, Sweet Nell, a mare with no higher
credentials for staying power than Marvel Loch. Nell
was handicapped to give her 71b. in the Cup, but the
more recent estimate puts her 41b. below the other lady.
Warroo is another one that looks well in the Cup on the
Toorak Handicap weights.

S.A. Supreme Court has upset the astonishing
police-court decision, whereby a street betting case was
dismissed because the prosecution had not “proved"
that any betting took place. (The remarks sworn to were,
“To invest on the handicap,” “What price Whirl?"
“3 to 1," “I’ll hive. ss. on”—and eventually “Whirl
won.” “One pound, is it not”; and payment of the
pound. But no expert evidence was given as to what
this talk meant!) The Chief Justice refused to believe
that this was “ merely an eccentric act ” on defendant's
part, and claimed that Judges are entitled to use the
knowledge they possess as men of the world.

Maoriland horse-owner Stead found that if
N.S.W. horses were not quite so fast as his horses, the
Income Tax Commissioners were capable of getting off
the mark at a great rate. They hit the Canterbury
Bportsman for a dividend on the £3570 he won at Rand-
wick during the recent meeting, and also for a dividend
on his loot made at the same meeting last year, when
they were too slow and let the great man depart without
asking him for 6d. in the £.

Justice Edwards’ bitter antipathy to the tote
was responsible for the light sentence of 12 months passed
on Percy Dawson, accountant to the Auckland (M.L.)
Racing- Club, who got away with £2937. Judge Edwards
made more remarks about the machine in delivering
judgment than he did about the prisoner and his crime.
He said that Dawson “ might have lived an honest,
respectable life but for that curse of society, the
totalisator. This legalised machine enabled the public to
gamble all the year round, every day and all day. Meetings
were multiplied simply for the sake of gains which were
derived from that instrument of depravity. However,
it was prisoner’s duty to be faithful to his employers
carrying on a legal, if immoral, business and to abstain
from stealing their money.” If Judge Edwards knew the
law he would be aware of the fact that race meetings
aren’t multiplied for the sake of gains from the tote. The
number of tote permits was fixed by Act of Parliament
years ago, and country clubs that have sprung up since
then have to do without the machine. And these are the
meetings which are a perfect Sheol owing to the horde of
bookmakers and welshers, and guessers, and pick-pockets.
A tote permit means quietness and honesty, and the
ejectment of undesirables from the paddock.

N.S.W. Rugby team is back from Maoriland,
mostly in splints. Swannell, who, when he played in the
British Fifteen, was counted a rough player, apparently
struck something harder than himself and had most of his
features in a sling; Burge and Murnin resembled
’eroes—blokes who had won the Victoria Cross and other
baubles in the shambles ; and everyone had his pet injury
to nurse and his score of scars to show. They are very
“ willing” in Maoriland, where it is considered bad form
to squeal when the man you tackle smashes you on the
nose.

As far as sport is concerned, the winter has
gone. Football is dead, or would have been but for the
unexpected inability of Rozelle and Balmain “Soccer”
teams to decide the destination of the Gardiner Cup. A
strenuous struggle ended in a draw, both teams scoring a
couple of goals. The referee ordered 20 minutes extra
play, ten minutes from each end, to decide which of them
should take the utensil, and each team attacked in turn,
only to be met by an invincible defence, so that when the
whistle blew they were still equal. They will meet again
next Saturday and endeavor to settle the matter. Any-
one who wants to see a really pretty game of football will
take a circle seat at Epping ground on Saturday, for
neither Ruggers nor Austral-rulers play their particular
game half as well as the “ Soccer” crow-d.
*.* * *
Football in Melbourne last Saturday was re-
stricted to a League final, an Association semi-final and
the Inter-State Schools’ match—Petersham (N.S.W.) v.
Clifton Hill (Vic.). Latter was played on the M.C.C.
Ground prior to the League match, and proved almost a
repetition of last year’s farcical game, when the same
Petersham beat Albert Park. The trouble is that the
Cornstalk teams are half-a-head taller and about a stone
and a-half heavier than the Vies., consequently no com-
parison of play is possible. There was this year
a restriction that all players were to be under 17,
but as all but one of the Victorian boys' were
under 15 the stipulation didn’t equalize matters
much. A weight-limit would work better. Game
ended—N.S.W. 3 goals 8 behinds to Vic. 2 goals 3
behinds. After that Fitzroy tackled Carlton for the
League final (Collingwood’s “ challenge ” final with the
winners transpires next Saturday), and up to half-time
the two gave an exhibition of fine, fast, strenuous ’ball—
the board then showing ’Roy 5 goals 3 behinds to Carl-
ton 4 goals 6 behinds. During the interval ’Roy
apparently came to the conclusion that it would be best
to make things sure out of hand, and it piled up 3 more
goals and 3 behinds in 15 minutes, the ball being within
shooting distance of Carlton’s goal almost the whole time.
Though the blue-and-whites made several violent efforts
after that, they never raised the score within gunshot of
the others’, who ultimately wound up with 11 goals 6
behinds to Carlton’s 6 goals 9 behinds. Ground was
packed, 26,000 persons parting with £938 —two-thirds of
which goes to the League’s funds.
At the East Melbourne ground some 12,000
people paid 6d. a head and got vastly more for their coin.
Here Richmond and “ Ports ” were arguing who should
meet North next Saturday in the Association final, and the
discussion was distinctly willing. The two teams
notoriously love each other like Heathens, and a lot of
extra police had been laid on, but when Richmond, in the
first quarter, kicked 5 goals 5 behinds to nothing,
Ports got properly aroused and waded in with vim
—also with elbows, shoulders and feet. At half-
time the figures were Richmond 6 goals 6 behinds
to Ports’ 4 goals 2 behinds, but immediately on
resuming the former potted two more goals. Then
someone’s elbow collided with an opponent’s eye, he re-
taliated viciously, there was a “ scrap,” and, before any-
one could fully grasp the circumstance, a dozen players
were letting out at one another right and left, and half
the crowd had swarmed over the pickets into the melee,
and was giving gratuitous advice, interspersed with
prods, bangs, and kicks. It took the police, the umpire,
and the more reputable supporters a good 10 minutes to
sort things out. The game after that was flabby and dis-
cursive, and nobody seemed to care much what happened.
Result was: Richmond, 11 goals 8 behinds ; Port, 7
goals 6 behinds. It was a nice, friendly game, the only
unusual circumstance about it being that no one attacked
the umpire.

At the final for the junior Wairarapa football
championship between Martinborough and Tuhirangi
(Maoriland), one supporter of the Martinborough team
offered a mounted deer’s head, valued at £5, for the first
player who crossed the opponent’s line ; and a Tuhirangi
barracker went one better with the offer of a free gift of
“an acre of land ! ” The Tuhirangis won the day, and
Bradstock, a young schoolmaster, gained the land.
A compromise has been arrived at by the dis-
putants in the question of forming' a Board of Control to
regulate international cricket, and the returning Aus-
tralian cricketers will find on arrival that the old order
has changed. N.S.W. is to have three places on the
Board, Vic. three, and Queensland one. Of the three
Victorians, one is to be appointed by the M.C.C., and two
by the local association ; and as the influence of the
powerful Melbourne club would probably have been
strong enough to secure a seat for its representative any-
how, the contending parties seem to have squabbled
violently over a small margin of difference. The S.A.
Association is the party to fall off the ’bus.

The fact that the Australian XI. is returning,
like the cows of the legendary Brown, in various quan-
tities and at irregular intervals, makes it very evident
that the team doesn’t expect to be received with fire-
works. However, like fevers and other things, it has
served its purpose, and the failure of the team at
the test matches hastened on the formation of the
national Australian Board of Control, which will
probably change the method of selection and
root out the old gang that was so largely influenced
by personal friendships. A few years back Eng-
land declined to send a team to Australia owing
to the paucity of bowlers. The absurdity of send-
ing this crowd to Britain without either a slow or
left-hand bowler was patent to every cricketer. But the
boodle was there waiting—what else mattered? Contrast
the return of the first XI. with that of the present team ;
no public reception for this crowd—no bells ringing,
unless, like the Duke of Plaza-Toro, they ring the door-
bell themselves.

‘ ‘ Snif.” : The only hat-trick done against the pre-
sent Australian XL seems to have gone unnoticed at the
time. Wilson, of Worcestershire, bowled Noble (113) at the
end of an over. Gehrs made lin the next over, and was
bowled by Wilson’s opening ball in the next, the second
one taking Laver. It was not so cabled out, and the Aus-
tralian papers put in the usual padding as to Laver being
bowled “ before he had scored.” This was the match in
which Cotter took seven wickets for 15, and (in all) 12
for 34.

Frank Iredale, the accomplished batsman, has
been “doing” the tour of the Australian XI. for several
London and Australian papers. Francis doesn’t wield the
willow and the pen with equal facility, but, apparently,
rather dreary stuff is good enough over the name of a
batting celebrity.

Australian Eleven manager Laver, the man who
is never without a smile, is an instance of a bowler reach-
ing his zenith at a time of life when most leather jerkers
have lost their fire and spin. He is an enthusiastic
wheelist, and having invested part of his share of the
swag in the latest thing in automobiles, will bring a
couple of the team surreptitiously across the continent, so
that they can reach the safety of their homes without
being too enthusiastically welcomed by the disrespectful
push.

Grade cricket starts in Sydney this coming
Saturday, while the juniors are already in the field. The
great, overshadowing North Sydney crowd has split into
three, Gordon and Middle Harbor having broken off and
started for themselves. North Sydney will not loom so
largely in grade cricket this year. Of the six inter-State
matches, three will be played at Sydney Cricket Ground—
the Queensland match on December 15, the South
Australian on January Bth, 1906, and the Victorian on
Jan. 26th. The other three matches will find Queensland,
Victoria and S’Australia battling against the Cornstalks
in their own capitals.

George Giffen has been made an honorary life-
member of S.A. Cricket Association. The veteran was
inclined to refuse the compliment, on the ground that it
must mean that his playing days are over, and he doesn’t
feel ready for the shelf yet ; but he was assured that the
only intention was to do him honor, and that he can play
till he is a grandfather if he likes. Another honorary is
W. O. Whitridge, who took an active part in forming the
association in 1871, and still bowls lobs in suburban
matches.

“ Wiljar ” : Was it really that fooling on board
(B. 31/8/’OS) that lifted Newland’s jaw off its hinges, or
sunstroke, ptomaine-poisoning, and strained-back that
incapacitated Gregory? Dreams are unreliable, but in
my dream I noticed not one Australian fielding. The
Englishmen hit fours. A toad-like Shape bowled respect-
ful “ under-armers.” Nobody raced, bat in hand, along
the pitch. The umpire, Cohen, said it was un-British,
and unnecessary. When England was tired scoring,
everybody adjourned for lunch ; and then Cohen, in pro-
posing the toast, said that the proceedings were highly
satisfactory, and the new loan would be granted as
desired.

Nine out of the 15 Australian Eleven
players put up a century off the bat during the tour,
and three bowlers reached the more difficult five-score
wickets. The only player to attain the honor in both
branches of the game was Armstrong.

George B. Richardson writes from Kelvin,
Dandaloo (N.S. W.): “In your last issue (21/9/’OS) I read a
par in your ‘Sporting Notions,’—‘Jim Cassidy, of
Bathurst, is the only survivor of the team of cricketers
who played against Stephenson’s XI at Bathurst in 1861.’
You are rather mistaken, as I for one am very much alive,
in fact just as much alive as I was when, in the match
referred to, I spun the bail round on Ned Stephenson’s
stumps, and did not knock it off. You will also, no
doubt, know (by repute) the Rev. T. B. Tress (C.E.) of
Sydney, who is still alive, also Sandy Naylor, of Nyngan.
These, with .my very old friend Jim Cassidy, still leave
four of us. I first played in Sydney in 1852, being, I be-
lieve, the first round-arm bowler in N.S.W. I may men-
tion that I played in a match at Bathurst as far back as
26th January, 1854—Western Goldfields v. Bathurst.”

The real secret of Yankee is bluff.
For instance, the following remarks by Arthur F. Duffey,
the sprinter, have appeared under tragic headlines in
nearly every paper of note published in the great braggart
U.S.A.: “ Arthur F. Duffey, the champion sprinter of the
world, who has just returned from a victorious tour of
Australia and Maoriland, has announced his retirement
from the cinder path. ‘I am through with running,’ he
said ; ‘ and that is why I came home. You ask why lam
quitting when at my best ? Because I am tired of the
game. I have had my day at it, and would rather leave
now, at the height of my fame, than wait for a defeat.’”
And the modest young American said nothing about a
gentleman named Nigel Barker, of Sydney University,
who beat him fair and square on Sydney Cricket Ground.

For many a day amateur athleticism in Maori-
land has suffered with the Tired Feeling, but there are
signs that that someone is beginning to take an interest
in the art of getting over hurdles, and a revival of paper-
chasing is threatened. Also, the Amateur Athletic As-
sociation has got a move on, and heaved out its secretary.
It is always a healthy sign when the secretary gets
heaved out onto the rim of his hat—it shows members are
taking an interest in things.
* # * *
“ Hamer ” : Spite of comments to the contrary,
ping-pong, like last year’s fashions, still lingers in the
country. The Banquo-like spectre of the game was resur-
rected from its grave at Muswellbrook (N.S.W.) the other
day, and it aroused all the enthusiasm there is in that
silent township, where it always seems to be Sunday
afternoon.

Armadale (Vic.) Bowling Club, winner of the
State’s premiership (for the third year in succession), has
played 31 matches for the past three seasons, and won
them all. It runs a standpipe, with a tap and tin mug
attached, as sole “ refreshments,” and the curse of drink
is not allow'ed to roost on its game. The success of the
club speaks well for temperance as an adjunct to bowls.
But after all is it worth while to be “ temperate ” even to
win at bowls ?

Maoriland cyclist O’Connor, who won the
Timaru-Christchureh (M.L.) Dunlop road race, made a
very poor showing in the Goulburn-Sydney run, and was
neyer placed among the front-rankers. There’s a lot of
luok about road racing, and it is just as well O’Connor
was not among the first-rankers—it would have cost him
his income to store his prizes. When he went back to
Timaru from Christchurch he took this little load with
him : A grand piano, valued at 55 guineas ; a Royal Swift
cycle, valued at £25; a cheque for £2O for the fastest
time ; a gold medal valued at five guineas ; and a blue
ribbon, worth just what his best girl could make out of it.

N.S.W. League of Wheelmen, after hawking
the mile international championship of Australia dis-
mally over the Commonwealth, has disposed of it to the
Victorian League for £7 10s. The N.S.W. League, when
it doesn’t get a championship, growls hideously ; and,
when it does get it, it sells it for a few shillings as if it
were hard up and wanted the few bob to keep itself out of
pawn. And either way it is a conspiracy against N.S.W.
—as Joseph Carruthers would say.

Don Walker’s record as an Australian cyclist
will take a deal of rubbing out. He has been
riding since 1889, and at the present time occupies
scratch mark alone. Just on 200 races have fallen
to his calves, with a contingency of over £3OOO in prizes.
Walker’s racing track longevity is probably a world’s
record.

The only foreign bike riders likely to invade
Australia this season will be Yankees Lawson and
MacFarland, and it is stated that each of these riders
is only returning to piok out a spot whereon to settle
permanently. The general opinion carried from Australia
last season was that Australian handicappers had too
lofty an opinion of foreign riders, and to win big handi-
caps cost too much labor.

N.S.W. bikist Frank Allsopp has about the
hardest luck of any of the State’s road racers. In the
Goulburn-Ash field race he has been placed three times —
—in 1902, 1904 and 1905; and this year also saw him
run second in the Bathurst-Ash field race. No other
rider, as far as this paper is aware, has such a record.
But he drifts steadily towards “ scratch,” getting all the
penalties and none of the big prizes of successful riding.

Joe Megson, once Sydney’s idol on the cycle
track, still pushes his jigger in public, but he is a snail-
like Joe to-day compared with the Joe of some seasons
back. In the Eight-Hours Demonstration cycle events,
which start the new season’s racing in N.S.W., Megson is
conceded 45yd. start in half-a-mile.

South Australian League of Wheelmen has
abandoned its October meeting “ owing to the fact that
there will be no visiting riders in Australia at that time.”
This sort of thing ought to rouse the blood of every
patriotic Australian. Dun’t Australians care to see
Australian cyclists race? This gang of ansomic Crow-
eaterS ought to be boycotted by local wheelmen after
such an insult, and left to subsist entirely on the entrance
fees of those precious foreign riders—international
parasites who mostly come to Australia under agreement
to receive appearance money.

The Dunlop motor reliability contest on the
Melbourne-Sydney r ad in November next is going to be,
judging by present appearances, a very stirring affair.
Some of the competitors have sworn to win the beautiful
Dunlop Cup at any cost, and are importing unusually
powerful machines to make sure of it. By November the
roads should be dry and hard, but the Dunlop party
which came across week before last, erecting danger discs
and notices where it was necessary to slacken speed,
nearly got drowned several times. They had been enjoying
a record downpour in some parts of Victoria, and the
greater part of the trip through Bent’s State was in
reality a voyage. In one awful place the car ran
along the alleged main road for miles with water
above the axles. At the worst spot the water
was over 6ft. deep. The car was a 12-16 h.p.
Decauville, and at the deepest part of the stream nothing
was to be seen but a cloud of spray, in the midst of which
the machine was quite invisible. Strange to say, the
engine did not stop running, but for quite a long time
after leaving the stream it continued to radiate water.
The Dunlop Cup, the first prize of the forthcoming
competition, is a beautiful bit of workmanship, and
valued at 100 guineas. The female figure and the car in
which she stands are both of phosphor bronze, and the
automobile is not a carving, but a real car, designed to
scale, made in separate pieces, and built up like a life-size
or adult automobile. It has only to be won twice to
become the sole property of any individual.

Anew terror has struck affluent Sydney.
Nowadays it is the correct thing, when you sympathise
with your friend’s charming but sadly-neglected wife,
to take her round the beauty spots in a motor-car. There
are any numbers of gentlemen who, thanks to the school
of motoring, can drive a car, but they do not complete
their education and learn to crawl underneath and use a
spanner while lying on the broad of the back, so when
they take the lady out it is necessary to take a mechanic
along too in case of a break-down ten miles from any-
where. Also, the mechanic comes in handy to hold the
machine’s head while the gentleman helps the lady to
gather bush blossoms, or ferns, or to take a snapshot
from the top of some adjacent knoll. But the mechanic
has his drawbacks ; he interferes with the conversation,
and motor people were being exhorted to provide a seat
for the brute on some part of the machine where he could
not overhear things, when the reptile suddenly developed
another vice. It is a bad vice too, and quite a number of
citizens are angry because of the sums these wretches
charge to hold their tongues.

Next Saturday will be a great day on the
waters of Port Jackson, and the Sydney sailing season
will start with a burst of bunting and a garden of white
sails. It was believed that the formation of the Motor
Boat Club would almost wreck sailing, but the prospects
are all the other way, and the new members have more
than filled the places of those who dropped out.

N.S.W. Rowing Association’s Championship
Regatta comes off on Saturday, October 7, and what with
equinoctial gales and private disturbances by Government
Meteorologist Hunt, the crews are all in a woefully un-
trained condition. There’ll be some awful language used
by the “ coaches” during the next week in the wild rush
to get the crews cursed and licked into shape. A foot-
ball coach can use slangwidge, but he is held somewhat
in restraint by the danger of some player suddenly try-
ing to break his neck. The rowing coach knows that no-
body dare break his neck for fear of capsizing the boat
and wetting the property, and he takes advantage of this.

How cycle road-racing does grow in Australia.
Long ago it was evident that the entry for the Warrnam-
hool-Melbourne road race would be a bumper one, and
when it soared up to nearly 250 riders it left all records
far behind. Then the handicaps appeared, and some fell
out, but the acceptors still number 196, which is a record
for the event. Last year it cost the big Dunlop Tyre Cos.
6s. per head for victuals for the riders, and as the men
do not dismount to eat or drink, but grab it as they flit
past, and occasionally they flit in batches of from 10 to 30,
quite a number of men have to be employed handing out
the provisions. Avery strong Maoriland contingent will
take part in the race, and as their form is said to have
improved considerably since the Goulburn run, the
islanders are expected to make a good showing.
* * * *
Some Melbourne people are remarking that, if a
revival in pugilism is to be effected by “Tote ” Wren, at
the local Exhibition Building, the moral tone of the com-
munity will soon need re-tuning. Pugilism can hardly
expect a very glorious revival from the police-protected
Tote merchant, whose dealings with cyclists ard other
sorts of sports have not been of an improving charm- er.
Moreover, apart from the question of Wren’s personality,
the letting of a Government building for stoushing
matches is repugnant to the feelings of a majoritv of the
public, who are nominally the owners of the costly pre-
mises.

The Turner-Robbo scrap at Sydney National
Sporting Club last week was disappointing. Robbo
attacked in the early part of the disturbance with great
vim, but his condition was not equal to his hurry, and
though several times he narrowly missed scoring a knock-
out, Turner survived the trouble. Then Robbo went to
pieces, going down more than once to get his wind. In
the 10th round he was plainly “ done,” and at last he lay
on his back from sheer exhaustion, and was counted out.
Colored brudder Joseph Walcott met Denny
Maloney at Sydney Gaiety Athletic Club on Satur-
day night last, and a pretty display of fur and feathers
resulted. Maloney relied on his strong right arm ; Mr.
Walcott hit freely with both hands, and the white man’s
burden of bruises and contusions increased rapidly. The
colored man seemed to bash by machinery, and slogged
away frenziedly, in holts and out of them ; and, although
he stopped a few heavy ones with his anatomy, he went
on whirling and bashing till, at the end of the ninth
round, the white man gave up. The burden of Walcott's
huge fryingpan-like fists was more than he could endure.

S.M. Herald, in ita “ On the Land ” column,
the other day, in the course of a vigorous appeal for more
stringent protection by law of native birds : “The un-
happy victims of the aboriginal instinct are unfortunately
unable to protest, save with the mute protest of God’s
creatures slaughtered to satisfy what is described as a
taste for sport, but is really a savage craving for the joys
of killing.” And in the same issue the Herald enthusi-
astically reported that at the “ shoot ” for the “ Ladies’
(Ladies, ye gods!) Trophies” at N.S.W. Gun Club’s
pigeon massacre, on the previous day, 33 shooters “ faced
the traps ” ; and that one alleged sportsman “ had hard
luck in finding his bird, although well hit, struggle over
the boundary. He refrained from using the second
barrel in the interests of backers.” Not much sympathy
here with “the mute protest of God’s creature” that
struggled bleeding and in agon} over the boundary, from
the sheer animal instinct to save its harmless life—that
mustn’t be put out of its pain “in the interests of
backers.” That was merely “ hard luck ” for the “sports-
man.”

The recent success of Maoriland horses at
Randwick (N.S.W.) recalls the fact that 50 years ago
Maori chiefs were prominent on the turf. In 1855 the
Maori chief Patuone had a whip made by Callow & Son, of
Park Lane, London, for presentation to a jockey who had
successfully piloted one of his horses. The whip was
mounted in silver, with a piece of greenstone set in the
end. Around the handle were represented horses and
jockeys, straps, buckles, &c., richly chased in silver ; and
on a large shield was the inscription in gibberish : “ Kia
Hemi Makerehi no Patuone—Maini Pereti £IOO. Te Niu
Tireni, 1855, Akarana.”

Hastier Hackenschmidt, who, like Sandow, has
gone into the doctoring business, has been telling some-
one that sweets are the best strength-producers. After
having wrestled in many countries, he has come to the
conclusion that the strongest people are the Turks. He
attributes their strength to their being great sweetmeat
eaters and not alcohol drinkers. “ Eat all the sweets you
can if you would be strong,” he says.

A Melbourne tobacconist lately told a bench of
magistrates that the sale of picture-cards representing
prominent footballers (which cards some cigarette-makers
put in their packets) was so brisk that he had doubled the
price without in any way diminishing the rush. Tho
trouble arose oyer a youngster who had stolen money to
buy the cards so that he might gloat over the cast-iron
countenances of his favorite ball-kickers.

“Two Seas”: Whenever some old slave of a
racehorse that has earned for its owner hundreds of
pounds over the sticks breaks its eager neck through fall-
ing at the last fence from sheer leg weariness, we read at
breakfast next morning that this was to be its last race, and
had it kept on its feet it would have been pensioned off
in a luxuriant grass paddock by the kind owner. Now, as
the public must be getting tired of that old gag, I suggest
that, for a change, we should be told that the noble
animal was a considerable loss, as the owner intended
selling it to a ’bus proprietor next week, and that it
realised a mere trifle as cat’s-meat.

N.S.W. Cricket Association has raised a fine
large spectre by quashing as informal the nomination of
Victor Trumper as a candidate for election on one of next
season’s Selection Committees. Trumper, it savs is a
“ professional cricketer.” If the Paddington idol is a
pro., then his colleagues in the Australian Team are cer-
tainly not amateurs, for most of them get what is tanta-
mount to appearance-money in inter-State matches, and
all share in the gate-receipts of the tour. In Australia,
the distinction between the lily-white amateur and the
professional is not of much moment; but in England the
status of the Australian cricketers will be not worth men-
tioning if they are known as professionals in their own
land. No more “ Mr. Darling” and “ Mr. Noble ’’ in the
cricket scores, and “ Mr. Howell ” and “ Mr. Kelly ” in
press interviews. The hardworking professional cricketer
in England has absolutely no social standing at all, and
before visiting Australians consent to join his down-
trodden ranks there will be trouble.

As an accompaniment to a Bruce auction re-
cently held in a Melbourne suburb there was a “grand
amateur bun-struggle for boys under 12." The buns
smeared with treacle, were hung on strings and set spin-
ning. Seven boys entered, and, with their hands tied
behind their backs, made frantic efforts to bite pieces of
bun, getting their faces and hair daubed with treacle, to
the great amusement of the crowd. There was much
barracking by pals of the competitors. After a time
Buster Smith and Fatty Green were seen to be getting
through their buns with comparative rapidity. Buster
just beat Fatty by a bite. He was triumphantly walking
away with the alarm-clock given as a trophy, when Fatty
entered a protest, on the ground that the winner was
over age. After careful consideration the stewards up-
held the protest j but by this time Buster was far away
with the prize. Also, the third man, Micko Doolan,
declared that Fatty was over age, too. Then the other
competitors and their friends joined in with various,
accusations against all the placed men, and, when writer,
had to leave to fulfil another engagement, things were
well in train for half-a-dozen fights. Thus does the taint
of sordid commercialism threaten ruin to every form of
sport.

A desire for actual participation in sport is rare
among the crowds that troop to the football field • what
is universal is a love to look at it, to talk about it, or to
bet on it. The players are really few, and the desire to
play almost non-existent among the mass of spectators.
It’s time there was a distinction drawn between the two
classes, Australians as a body are not unduly given to
sport—for what is true of football is true of cricket and
other games—but are unduly given to standing around
the field where sport is carried on.

N.S.W. has at last got rid of the yacht
Victoria at a net loss of £34.000 to the State. The
vessel was bought whilst the Owe’Sullivan loan
boom was on, and was designed to take politicians,
gownors and other potentates on trips of State
around the coast. It has now been sold for a song.
New South Wales Divorce Court tried a
case in the present sittings in which one of Bruce
Smith’s black brethren figured largely. This par-
ticular brother was a Hindu “doctor.” Fifteen
years ago a Brisbane girl, aged 18, went for a long
walk. She was overtaken first by a sore foot, and
afterwards by the Hindu medicine man in a
buggy. He offered the lame duck a lift, which
she cheerfully accepted, and when he offered his
heart and hand she accepted them also. The
Hindu soon tired of his wife, and sought distrac-
tion in the smiles of other girls, and the
Bride from the Buggy led an unhappy life until
her nigger husband, in 1903, married another
white girl. For this he got five years gaol, and
gave his first wife an opportunity of release. A
dispiriting feature about the case is the fact that
there are enough white women ready to marry
a nigger to make it quite easy for the black
brother to commit bigamy.
Flags at Half Mast. —From time to
time it is an ordinary thing for us to see the flags
at half mast on different public buildings in token
of respect to some member of official, political and
social life. That man was apparently in perfect
health, and a few short weeks backs little thought
that his life would end so quickly. His death
comes as a surprise, making his friends and rela-
tions serious and sorrowful for a life so quickly
ended. There must have been some reason for the
early demise, which was only an effect of a cause,
and that cause was certainly disease, which
corrupted the delicate mechanism of the body,
threw something out of gear, interfering with its
effectual working. With some men a serious
disease may arise from a simple cause, he may be
in complete ignorance of disease or death to within
a few hours of its appearance. Any man who may
be in doubts as to his general condition and who
suspects that he is not in the state of health which
he should be, should write or communicate with
Dr. Richard Wallace, Medical Staff of the Freeman
and Wallace Medical Institute, Elizabeth and
Bathurst-streets, Sydney, who make no charge for
friendly counsel if a personal visit is paid or for an
opinion freely expressed in reply to any letter re-
ceived by him. He is an expert in the effective
treatment and rapid cure of men’s serious dis-
orders.*
A disastrous lire at South Melbourne

burned that his life was despaired of, while his
wife actually died from the shock —brought to
light no less than four persons who each claimed
to have rescued the injured man from the flames.
Two of them asserted they had carried him, at
great personal risk, out of the front door, and the
other two said they had dragged him, at desperate
hazard, out of the back door.
Melbourne Hospital Committee has just
completed its crawlsome project to fritter away
£50 of the moneys of this always insolvent institu-
tion in obtaining from the College of Heralds, or
some such comic-opera body, the right to call
itself “Royal.” The average cost of a patient in
the hospital is about 15s. a week, so the scheme
really means that some series of unfortunates, who
might otherwise be maintained, and probably
cured of their sickness, will be denied admission
to the institution for a period of about 15 months,
in order that a score of servile people may gratify
their natural instincts. The outrage was carried
on the motion of Dr. T. P. Mclnerney, largely
advertised as a sincere democrat at various time*
during his career.
“ Hypo ” from Victoria : —
Minister Swinburne’s Water Bill has created consterna-
tion amongst the monopolistic land(-and water)-lords ot
Victoria. The “ Beds and Banks ” definitions have been
particularly a source of agitation in the Fatuien’s souls, i.e.,
their pockets. They have attempted to show, among
other things, that the action of the river w'aters has
decreased their holdings by washing hits away. Hence,
they argue, they have a right to the rivers which hav•
robbed them. But what of those who have had thiir
territory added to ? I know of many instances w'here the
latter has occurred. Also know of cases where these
land-and-water-lords have actually claimed (and received)
rent for land below the high-water mark of rivers, wh ch
land, under the conditions of their freehold, they had no
ownership of. Have also been stopped from shooting on
(and even fishing in) the rivers adjacent to these pro-
perties. Have been stopped from chopping firewood on
the closed roads on the estates. Were these gentry to
have undisturbed possession much longer, ordinary folk
would need a special permit to breathe.
Sydney Ragged School children, when
directed to sing the “Doxology,] the other day,
at a public function, burst out with “God Save
the King,” and the incident is taken as proof of
the urchins’ training in loyalty. It proves a lot
of things, and among the rest that the apathy of
the public in supporting those Sydney institutions
has a reasonable cause. They should be Govern-
ment institutions, instead of under the control of
society hangers-on, who teach the children that
the chief business of life is to sing “ Gor Save.”

“Dinghy, Ahoy! Bring' plenty of CAPSTAN !’


Made in
Australia.
THE Victorian Laundry and Ironing
Exhibition, held at the Melbourne
Exhibition Building, if it did nothing
else, splendidly demonstrated the utter folly of
buying ‘ ‘ sweated-labor, ’’imported Shirts when in
our midst there is a well-conducted Shirt-making
industry carried on by such a firm as Buckley
and Nunn, Melbourne, who are in a position
to buy direct from the loom on equal terms with
the English manufacturer, and yet manufacture
and sell in Australia on better terms. The
working exhibit—a miniature replica of the con-
ditions and working of Messrs. Buckley and
Nunn’s factory—completely convinced the
many visitors to the Exhibition that in buying
Shirts from Buckley and Nunn’s an Australian
industry is stimulated at an actual gain to the
purchaser.
Messrs. Buckley and Nunn believe in
putting their clients on the best possible footing,
and, wherever practicable, eliminating the
middleman and the loading of the price of goods
with unnecessary profits and charges. This was
the idea which prompted the establishment of
their most up-to-date Shirt factory—a factory
which forms the one link between the loom and
the wearer in any part of Australasia, doing
away entirely with the jobber in London, the
heavy duty on the imported article, and also
with intermediate profits this side.

Shirt-making Demonstration by Buckley & Nunn, at the Victorian Laundry Exhibition,
in the Melbourne Exhibition Building,
Patriotism Pays.
Ihe man who buys English shirts incurs a loss compared with
the man who buys his shirts from Buckley & Nunn as the
following figures amply prove. Take the basis of £lOO of linen
bought from the mill by the English manufacturer :
m
Cost of material
Cost of labor.
Cost of selling and buying in London, say,
This then represents invoice price of shirts
in London.
Now you have to add this on to cover 27* per
cent, duty and 12J per cent, charges, and
then you get the
Total landed cost of shirts bought in London
to which you have to add
Another 33§ per cent, for retailers’ profit,
making the
Total which the Australian who does not
support Australian industry has to
pay for English-made shirts.
But this is how you score if you buy Shirts from Buckley
and Nunn— Shirts, mind you, that are Made in Australia of
exactly the same linen as is put into the English Imported Shirt.
Remember, Buckley and Nunn buy direct from the loom and
get the same value for their £lOO as the English manufacturer.
ooiar
£219
B. &N. buy England direct off loom the
same as English manufacturer, and to
this, being raw material, only
6| per cent, and 12J per cent, charges have to
be added to make the
Total.
Now add cost of labor, say,
One-third retailers’ gross profit
And we finish our lesson in patriotism and
arithmetic by pointing out that there is
a gain of one-third in buying direct from
B. & N.
The “ Perfecfla” Shirt.
“ The Perfecta ” is the registered name of the Oxford Shirts
manufactured by Messrs. Buckley & Nunn in Australia of some
hundreds of designs of material, and at 53. 6d. is the best value
possible. It is really instructive to get from Messrs. Buckley
and Nunn particulars and patterns.
White Shirts.
The output of White Shirts by Messrs. Buckley and Nunn
is very great, and there is always the demand to be met for both
day and evening dress wear in the various styles that fashion and
comfort now dictate. Messrs. Buckley and Nunn guarantee all
qualities at 6s. 6d., Bs. 6d., and 10s. 6d.
Direct from the Loom.
Finally it must be borne in mind that the linen is bought by
Buckley and Nunn direct from the mills and that Messrs.
Buckley and Nunn’s system of measurements ensures a perfect
fitting Shirt for anybody in Australia.

Victoria owns a School for Wives. This
is its sub-title. It is officially known as the Insti-
tute ot Domestic Economy, but its chief purpose,
is to give the young feminine idea points in the
management of home and husband—“ practical
knowledge of thexlomestic arts,” the circular calls
it. It seems appropriate to ask if the teachers
and professors in the School for Wives are them-
selves graduates from the school of matrimony,
?. ad, if so, have they testimonials from their last
!. usbands ? Many women are excellent liouse-
keepers but very bad wives. This type devotes
i: s maiden years to catching a husband, and its
married years to keeping a house.

Making Money
I was born on a Maine farm. I have made some
great successes in business. My greatest through
Co-operation.
I took $1,500 < £306:2:6) capital, supplied by
Farmers, Women, Physicians, Clerks, Clergymen,
etc., in Belfast, Maine, and in an honest, but very
profitable business, earned and paid them through
BELFAST NATIONAL BANK, $5,000 Ul, 020:8:2)
in Cash dividends in the first six months, $25,000
(£5,102:0:10) in cash dividends within the next
year, and in 18 months I paid them in round
numbers $330,000.00 (£67,346:19:2) CASH.
Every 4s. Earned £44:17$

This is HISTORY. Reads
like a fairy tale but it is
TRUE. I made poor
people rich. They helped
me earn the riches. Just
read that over again. I
had SI,SOO. I earned
and paid my stockholders
$330,000 in cash In 18
months. Every stock-
holder got their share.
That’s my Way of doing
business. You must be-
lieve this statement is
TRUE, for, if Iwerelying,
I wouldn’t tell you the
place where I earned the
money, and the BANK
where it was paid.
I have learned the great
Value of the rightkindof
co-operation, learned how
to make money fast in an
honest, profitable busi-
ness from which millions
are made every year.
I now have a new busi-
ness of the same kind,
only myfield is the World.
It is incorporated under
_ the laws of the State of
Maine and the U. S. Gov’t. The Stockholders are
absolutely protected from any liability. They are
safe guarded by law. My plan one of extended co-
operation. Stockholders everywhere who can give
me information and lend their INFLUENCE. The
dividends must be large.
I already have 4,000 stockholders in the IT. S.,
Canada, England, Cuba, Mexico, Sandwich Islands,
Gibraltar, etc. I want a few more. The shares
are going fast. You can invest 4s. or £IOO.
Monthly payments; if you wish. It will be safe
and we will make it grow. This is no gambling
or “shady” scheme. It’s legitimate business.
You will be treated squarely and honestly.

own interest to INVESTIGATE. You shall have all

'rof. R. H. BARRADEN, bo Pitt St., Sydney.


There was a sensation in a Sydney street
the other day. A man was down in the sewer,
effecting repairs, or looking for a land-agent’s
missing books, or something. The circular iron
cap had been removed from the surface of a man-
hole, and the sentinel on top happened to look
away for a second. A stout, purple-faced woman
took advantage of his inattention to step into the
opening with both feet, and commenced to des-
cend with terrific velocity. She stopped at her
hips with a dull, beefy thud. Then all Sydney,
with seven common policemen and two sergeants,
seemed to spring up like one harlequin through
the cracks in the street blocks. The distressed
lady squealed with fury, and threatened revenge,
police courts, and heavy damages, and that she
would make them prove it. A facetious on-
looker suggested using a shoe-horn to slide
her up on, but was called a heartless person,
and was requested to “ Have a bit of sense ! ” Then
the aggregate gendarmerie, with the light of battle
in its eye, bent down, got a firm grip, and com-
menced to lift. The front part of its head grew
purple and threatened to burst. The stout lady
groaned dismally and wept, and said she would
yet demonstrate her innocence and dispel false
accusations. The force put on an extra heave,
and she began to rise like a full-blown moon above
the landscape. The crowd cheered. The police
made a last effort, and the lady burst forth from
her partial concealment like a flower breaking out
in the spring. She was saved. Again she said
that the base aspersions cast on her good name
would yet be dissipated. The sergeant said he
didn’t care whether her name was aspersed or
not: he would take it as it was and put it down in
his book against a charge of breaking into Govern-
’ment property. Then the sewer man looked down
the hole and found his mate insensible.
“ Hypo,” from Victoria :—
The anti-Socialist propaganda has reached our town.
Two ladies are paying house-to-house visits, and explain-
ing to our womenfolk the frightful state of chaos which
will ensue if they do not vote against the Socialists. The
missionaries, being local squatters’ wives, have some
weight with our women, and, after their visits, groups of
females may be seen gathered together, and discussing
the possible and probable cost of the mission ladies’ hats.

WHEN THE FLAGS * HALF-MAST
Sometimes it is an ordinary thing for us, when leaving our homes of a morn-
ing, to see flags at the different public buildings half-mast for some prominent
member of official, political or social life. That man was, a few weeks ago, appa-
rently in perfect health ; he walked about amongst his friends, he laughed and he
smiled, and little thought that in a few weeks’ time his Sun of Life would per-
manently set. His death comes as a surprise amongst his circle of acquaintances,
and makes them at all times serious and sorrowful, but they have to bow to the
inevitable law of continuous change, of Life and Death.
Some part of the delicate mechanism of his body had been thrown out of gear.
Some defect interfered with its correct working. When we inquire into the ail-
ment from the physicians who made the post-mortem examination, we are told,
perhaps, that an aneurism had generated, an artery had clogged, the heart
became choked, surcharged with blood, his life went out like a flash.
This may have been caused by simple Indigestion being the primal cause, pol-
luting the blood, filling it full of Uric. Acid Poison, and other properties that
destroy the red corpuscles, which are at all times the Policemen of the Blood,
and whose mission it is to clear it and preserve its purity. Great effects arise from
little causes, and Indigestion and Dyspepsia have killed thousands.
It is time people learned that Indigestion or any form of stomach trouble is
not a thing to trifle with. It may not be fatal in all instances, but there can be
no condition of Diseased Stomach which does not carry with it Physical Loss,
Weakness, and at all times probability of permanent physical ruin.
The Specialists of
T " c FREEMAN & WALLACE
MEDICAL
INSTITUTE
Sydney, have a large percentage of cures in the treatment of these complaints,
and will be pleased to reply to any correspondence that may be sent to them as to
their methods of cure. Their remedies do their work in a thorough manner.
They give the HEALTH THAT IS ALL HEALTH, the strength that is sub-
stantial and lasting. There are no false stimulants, a genuine, complete and
renewed vitality is given.
The Physician-in-Chief is registered by Australian, English, and American
Medical Boards, and is a Specialist of European renown in the cure of all Diseases
of the Male Sex.
The person concealed in the fangs of the
Rattle Snake is not more terrible in its
elect upon the Human System than Blood
Poison. The snake warns before he strikes,
Blood Poison does its Deadly work so assi-
duously that the victim remains in igno-
rance of its presence until some startling
symptom develops and every drop of blood
in his veins is poisoned.
This disease is too violent and dangerous
to be trifled with. Assurances or promises
of speedy cure will not do. Experience
must teach a sufferer that this disease does
not yield to mild or shallow treatment. The
poison must be completely eradicated, the
Blood thoroughly puri ed before a lasting
cure can be effected.
The FREE’/lAN & WALLACE methods are
absolutely certain in their cure of Blood Poison,
no matter from what source it may arise. They
destroy the Virus, purify the Blood, cure
thoroughly its every form and stage. For a
(Quarter of a Century their methods have been
recognised as a Specific for Blood Poison, and no
one need despair of a cure if there is any physical
foundation upon which to work.
Drastic remedies are often used to counteract this
poison of the Blood, but they are often injurious,
causing lasting injury to the System. Tiie FR EE-
MAN & WALLACE remedies are not mineralised.
They do not ruin the Digestion, or leave behind
Rheumatism, or any comoiaint which is worse than
the disease. Their specific is strictly vegetable,
and the remedy reliable in its effect.
Write for their FREE BOOK on BLOOD POISON, which conta ns much interesting information about
the different Stages, Symptoms, etc., and by following the instructions given in it and keeping in
correspondence with our Medical Department you can cure yourself at home.
We make no charge for Medical advice. This book is a medium of genuine instruction, and should be
in the house of every man who may be far from Medical aid or any centre where a Medical man practices.
He should always have it in the house, and he should lend it to his friends if he thinks such lending
would be of value.

SYMPTOMS OF KIDNEY DISEASE.
Pain or Deadly ache in the back is unmistakable evidence of Kidney trouble. It is
Nature’s timely warning- to show you that the track of health is not clear. If this danger
signal is unheeded very serious results are sure to follow ; Bright’s Disease, which is the
worst form of Kidney trouble, may steal upon you.
The mild and extraordinary effect of the world-famed treatment and Kidney and
Bladder remedies of THE FftE 3 MAN and WALLACE PHYSICIANS and
SURGEONS is soon realised. Their skill stands the highest for its wonderful cures of
the most distressing cases. We are certain that if you communicate with them and accept
their treatment they will soon convince you as they have convinced hundreds of other
people.
“Lame Back” is only one symptom of Kidney trouble and one of many. The Deadly
continuous ache in the small of the back is a certain symptom, also Catarrh of the Bladder,
Uric Acid, Constant Headache, Dizziness, Sleeplessness, Nervousness, Irregular Heart
Beating, Rheumatism, Lack of strength and Ambition, Sallow Complexion, and the worn
out continuously tired feeling.
These are unmistakable symptoms of defective Kidney Diseases ; the blood being
charged with Uric Acid is more like lead in the veins than anything else, and the Urine has
a cloudy appearance, which is evidence that the Kidneys and Bladder need immediate
attention. If you have any of the above symptoms attend to them at once.
Write to the Phvsieian-in-Chief of the Institute, Dr. Richard Wallace, who will send
you full particulars of his method of treatment, and advise you FREE as to your best policy
to pursue.
All letters will be replied to punctually and without any loss of time, and he will show
you how you may be cured in your own home without expense of personal visits.

fa FAMED AS A FAMILY MEDICINE FOR A CENTURY. Invaluable to every Mother of a family, g*


“Stony”: “Pierrot” (B. 20/7/’05) refers to the
Children’s Column business. It had been my idea for a
long time that the whole thing was a more or less
unnecessary “fake ; ” and when given the part (among a
large number of other parts) of “ Uncle Bobby ” on a
provincial rag, I learned things which confirmed my
impressions, and became a fakir myself in due course.
The “artistic and literary ” competitions usually provided
about two triers altogether, and mostly in one family at
that. If the results were bad (as they generally were) the
prize-winner was simply announced without publication
of the unfortunate matter. Letters were invited, and
occasionally some misguided child would send along a
frightful screed, which had to be greatly revised for
print. I also wrote a few myself. “Pierrot” says
flippantly that the production of the necessary comment
must be a fearful strain on the intellect. It’s certainly
much better fun to report a three-hours indignation meet-
ing about the local drainage system than to spend half
that time in writing sympathetic drivel about sister Ann’s
black cat’s sad end in the rain-barrel.

LEG
With Wounds that discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen, tnat when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints b: ing
ulcerated, the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease,
if alio wed to continue, will deprive you of the power to walk.
You may have attended various hospitals and had medicai
advice and been told your case is hopeless, or advised to
subm:t to amputation ; but do not, for I can cure you I
don’t say perhaps, but I will. Because others have failed
ltisno reason I should. Send at once for a Box of Albert s

A Mother’s
Anxiety
r\ESPITE the mother’s unremit-
ting care, how few of our
children pass through the tender
years of childhood free from all
ailments ! Happily there is some-
thing which can relieve the con-
stant anxiety of the intelligent
mother who well knows that
little ailments, if neglected, easily
become serious. This is SCOTT’S
EMULSION of cod liver oil with
glycerine and the hypophosphites
of lime and soda, a perfect remedy
for all children’s troubles, for colds
and coughs, rickets, skin troubles,
teething troubles, wasting, frac-
tiousness, whooping cough, meas-
les, croup. Read this letter which
came to us from Mrs. K. Clarke,
or Perth, Western Australia, dated
January 13th, 1904: —
“ During the time we resided on the
goldfields, my little son Sydney suffered
greatly from prostration, accompanied
>-N
with vomiting and
loss of appetite, du-
ring the summer
mouths. By giving
him Scott’s Emulsion
he was quite freed from
these attacks
during the
past two sum-
mers. I also
gave it to
attack of dysentery,
and was surprised at
the rapidity with which
he regained his health
and strength. I recom-
mend Scott’s Emul-
sion especially to any
mother who has deli-
cate or ailingcliildren.”
Scott’s Emulsion
will do in a week
what common oil
and inferior emul-
sions will not do in
a month. The rea-
son is simple.
Scott’s Emulsion is
perfectly pleasant to
take and perfectly
digestible, which no
other form of cod
liver oil is.
Every experienced mother knows
that such a remedy is most certain
to prove itself a TRUE REMEDY.

LIFE.
(BY “VIVA.”)
No living thing, from man to a microbe, can exist unless it is continuously dying. It is not merely
necessary tor man to absorb nourishment in order to live ; it is equally necessary that, simultaneously,
some portion of his body, bone, blood, or tissue, must waste away and die. It is essential, also, that'll
balance be preserved m the two processes of replenishing the body and the removal of the waste or
dead material which is constantly accumulating within it. An uneven action of either means disease.
A total suspension of either means death. •
Of course everyone knows that an adequate supply of suitable food, pure water and fresh air is
requisite to build up the body, but, unfortunately, most people are not as well aware of the complicated
action ol the mechanism with which nature has endowed man for dealing with the used-up, dead and
waste material always being produced within us, and which, unless regularly extracted from the blood
and expelled from the body, must cause disease or death.
t qP 011 th ® s kin, lungs, kidneys and liver rests the main responsibility of removing waste matter
from the sj stem. Ihe skin usually requires little attention beyond regular washing with good soap
and water, and it will, in the form of perspiration, rid the body of a quantity of dead matter. A fit of
coughing or a chocking sensation will speedily call our attention to anything which hinders the lungs
m heir wor.t of removing, in the form of carbonic acid, an amount of used-up material equivalent to
eig it ounces of pure charcoal every day. The kidneys and liver, on the other hand, are delicate organs,
and it is often not until we begin to suffer from some serious complaint that we become aware that
their action is impeded. Rheuniatism, Gout, Lumbago, Neuralgia, Backache, Sciatica, Blood Dis-
orders, Indigestion, Biliousness, Jaundice, Sick Headache, General Debility, Gravel, Stone, Bladder
1 roubles. Depression, Lovvlemperature, Antenna, Bright’s Disease, are all caused by disease, or
3 ■ erent action of the kidneys or liver, or both of those organs, permitting the body to retain
urinary and biliary waste poisons which it is their functions to eliminate from the blood and expel in
a natural manner.
W| l[ therefore be seen how important it is that the vigorous health and activity of the kidneys
and liver should be maintained. A person suffering from one or more of the many complaints men-
loned should not regard them as diseases, but should adopt the rational course of attacking them at
e.r true source,.by restoring a proper and regular action of the kidneys and liver, when, the cause of
e t isorc ers having been rectified, the waste matter which produces the trouble is removed and
health ensues as a matter of course.
It was the comprehension of this fact which resulted in the discoverv of Warner’s Safe Cure.
Uertiun medical men—being aware of the difficulty of treating the disorders referred to, and knowing
a ley weie due to inefficient action of the kidneys or the liver, but being unable in most cases to
accura t y c lagnose just which organ was at fault—set themselves the task of compounding a medicine
vhicli would act specifically upon the kidneys and liver alike. After long research they succeeded,
and introduced the medicine to the world under the name of Warner’s Safe Cure. This was about
ir ) y e/ 4 s a go, and since then many millions of bottles have been sold, and people have
- • savc b. rom pain, suffering and death by taking a course of this invaluable specific for all kidney
and liver diseases and disorders arising therefrom. [8

“ Hassan “ : “ Pad, boys—pad for all you’re worth,”
said the old journalist, cunning- in his craft. “ They pay
as much for the stuffing as the meat. If you are con-
scientious, cutting down to bed-rock, you’ll get left; and
Jones, who blows out his little facts to bursting point,
will draw more brass than you will on pay-day. Mind
you, the padding lias to be pretty well done ; you mustn’t
show the lumps. But if you get it to run weli, the editor
doesn’t spot it —he has too much to do trimming his sails
to the proprietary breeze. Thus you’ll get credit for a
1 nice light style.’ Great is the adjective ; it helps to
fill up. Always use one, or, if possible, two. Don’t try
three yet; that requires a skill you haven’t got, and
you’d fall in. Any editor would spot it. This space-rate
business makes me tired. I send in a half-column of
crisp copy. I get 10 or 15 bob. Jones, two weeks later,
cribs my stuff, enlarges it to two columns, and gets two
or three quid. Jones wears a top hat ; I wear a hunted
expression, and many streets are closed to me. If I
weren’t so old I’d chuck it and go in for palmistry or
cricket—anything where a man gets paid according to
merit. What? No such occupation! Go to! young
man. You’re a cynic—pure cheek at your age. But, as I
was saying yes—l don’t mind if I do.”

“ Polstan ”: The boss mean paper of Australia first
informs contributors that it doesn’t pa}' for anything, and
then informs them that everything must be typed, or it
won’t have a show in the scramble ; only matters of the
greatest interest must be tackled, and anything that isn’t
absolutely original isn’t wanted. Then follows a haughty
remark or so apropos of the kind of article the journal
doesn’t mind accepting, followed by a request to send
stamped wrappers with MSS. Lastly, you mustn’t expect
a reply in the Contributors’ Column, because there isn’t
one. You don’t yet have to send six penny stamps to
secure consideration ; but that is coming.

“Melb.": I was working for the Herald when Sam
Winter specially impressed on a new message boy, his first
day out, that he must not be afraid to walk straight into
the Supreme Court and ask for copy. The three Judges,
in their robes, were sitting on a divorce appeal of the first
moment. The new boy went into the court, and addressed
the Chief Justice aloud with, “Any copies for the
Herald, please?”

Professor Morris, of Melbourne University, fell in very
badly once. An Oxford don, whose motive is wrapped in
gloom, wrote to him asking to be supplied with samples
of the best and worst daily papers issued in Australia.
Morris sent copies of Melbourne Argus and Evenin’ ’Erald,
reckoning that the two were respectively the best and
worst dailies he knew of. The Oxford friend received
them in due time, and wrote back that he thought the
Herald a pretty fair sort of print, but he agreed with
Morris that the Argus was the stupidest rag he had ever
set eyes on. It isn’t safe, nowadays, to write to Prof.
Morris to ask for samples of Australian journalism.
Samples of snort are invariably received by the next post.

From still another man who seems to think that he can
make a crust out of the “machinations of Rome ”:—
“Dear Bulletin.—As you have persistently rejected
my contributions, with Kentish fire and other signs of
contempt, I have decided to change my rillijun. For
many years I have been a very strong Evangelical Pro-
distan (whatever that may be); but I will henceforth be a
Roamin’ Carthlic, in order to secure rapid preferment on
your long list of outside contributors. I send herewith
57 pars., 9 poems, and 13 sketches.”

“Rep.”: I rise to invoke a curse on the memory of
Isaac Pitman. Since that painstaking ghost (whose por-
trait, still looks blandly out from the frontispieces of short-
hand text books) perfected his system, the world has suf-
fered untold agonies of verbatim reporting. More and
more it has been delivered into the mouths of People Who
Talk. The preachy parson and the perorating politician
have come to regard it as their right to have every bubble
of their froth recorded—and in the pride of being- able to
satisfy this craving, newspaper ri porting (under Pitman’s
baleful spell) has been directed along false lines of verbiage
for 100 years. The result is that in Britain and Australia,
at any rate, men are no longer judged by their actions
but by their words. Only in America, the land where
People Do Things, has the enchantment of Pitman lost
its power. Elsewhere we are in thrall to him and Bumble-
dom. For the sake of a national standard of deeds, not
words, let the memory of Pitman be accursed, and the
devotees of his black art burned at the stake.
* * * *
“ Kaira ” : I unanimously condemn the inanity of the
country correspondent pars, in the city papers. Budding
journalists get hold of some exciting (to them) occur-
rence, and, with perspiration running into their boots,
they frantically rush into the telegraph office and wire
away something like this:—“What might have been a
very serious accident might have happened here to-day
but for the intervention of Providence. Mr. Thomas
Todd was proceeding down the street when he tripped
over his feet and fell. Had the fall taken place ten yards
to his right, he would have fallen down the No. 3 shaft of
the Dead Beet Gold Mining Co., and instant death would
have been certain.” Or, by way of diversion, there’s the
what-might-have-been fire. “ What might have been a
very serious conflagration was narrowly averted here to-
day. Mr. William Jones was passing the Mullock Hotel
when a spark flew from his pipe. Had the wind been
blowing (as it usually does at Muddee) the spark must
have blown into a box of straw placed in the yard, and
the hotel and a valuable block of buildings must have
been destroyed. As it was, the spark fell into the horse-
trough.” At the next meeting of the Journalists’ Insti-
tute I intend to propose the expurgation of everything
beginning “ What might have been,” and, if my motion
isn’t carried, I’ll resign in a mob.

“H.”: Went to “a Bohemian smoke night” in Mel-
bourne, the other evening, and the whole 60 artists and
scribblers present hadn’t a dirty collar amongst them.
Their linen was deafeningly clean and respectable ; and I
couldn’t hear myself drink for the uproar of their immacu-
late cuffs and shirt fronts. And I had been told that
Bohemia was a sort of Cannibal Club, which defied its
landlord, while the wind blew through the arabesques of
its perforated coat.

Melbourne Argus recently got off an amazingly original
remark in its leading article: “ When we think of
Macaulay’s Maori gaz: ng upon the ruins of St. Paul’s,”
&c. Oh, that weary old Maorilander who has camped on
the ruins of London bridge so often and never once dropped
in! He grows worse than monotonous. Even King Billy
gazing on the decayed fragments of the Argus would be
a pleasant change.

“ Gilrooney ” : I love those little Labor papers, but with
the sort of love the average mother has for her prodigal
son. There isn’t in Australia to-day, to my knowledge, a
single official Labor paper advocating with any enthusiasm
a system of High Protection. Indeed, several of them
(Barrier Truth is a glaring example) openly barrack for
Freetrade ; the remainder are content to let things slide
and “ sink the fiscal issue.” And the curious part of the
whole miserable business is that, while the Labor press
and the Parliamentary parties are vainly trying to drown
something that knows how to swim, the workers of Aus-
tralia almost unanimously favor a high tariff. It seems to
me that the toilers will be foolishly misrepresented and
hopelessly handicapped until they have their journalists
writing Protection leaders and their politicians strenu-

The S.M. Herald, established in April, 1831, as The
Sydney Herald, by Stevens, Stokes, and M’Garvie, was
published in a building opposite Gallows Hill, Lower
George-street, and nearly opposite the Union Inn, kept
by the father of the late George Thornton, M.L.C. On
the first night of publication George Thornton was sent
across the road to hold candles to help the printer at his

but the printing house at the rear has just been de-
molished to make room for a modern building
In a made-in-England Australian novel, just to hand, a
swag is described as “a piece of oilcloth provided with
straps, and takes the place of a portmanteau.” According-
to the book, a swag carries with it some standing. “If a
man has not even got a swag he is reckoned a sundowner
in colonial eyes.” Our forest kings are alluded to as
being fully seventy feet high ; and when the Australian
bushman wants assistance he gives the recognised call of
“ Ooo.” After saying all this in one chapter, the author
fights clear of local color in a painfully skilful manner.
When a girl advertises for a position as.
barmaid she is now and again invited by letter to
call at a certain place, and, on arriving there, she
is lectured on the enormity of the offence of vend
ing liquor. That insolence was aggravated lately.
An advt. stated that barmaids were wanted, and
when they turned up at the address there was n<
billet—it is said there was not even a refund of the
tram-fares—only an excited teetotal person and a
severe lecture.

How to Make the Liver Act Properly
Rev. Charles Wincott
WRITES :
“ Gentlemen,—About three years ago I
was confined to my bed for a short time with
a very acute attack of Liver complaint.
After other medicines had failed to take any
effect, I was recommended by my doctor to
try Kutnow’s Powder, and I am glad to say
that after taking two bottles I was com-
pletely cured, and my health has been
better ever since. I have since recommended
your excellent preparation to quite a number
of sufferers, who testify of similar results.
“(Rev.) CHAS E. WINCOTT.”
(Incumbent of St. Phillip’s Church,
(Adlington, Lancs.)
Dr. THORPE writes:
“ Grant Building, Los Angeles.
“ I prescribe Kutnow’s Powder and take
it myself occasionally ; it never fails to bring
about the most gratifying results in the most
pleasant manner.”
Sir J. B. MONCKTON
(Late Town Clerk of London) wrote :
“Guildhall, London, E.C.
“Gentlemen,: —I have much satisfaction in
stating that for the last two years I have
regularly used Kutnow’s Powder, with the
result that troublesome and frequent attacks
of lumbago, with other gouty symptoms that
had troubled me for years, seem to have
entirely disappeared. ’ ’
THE FOOD PASSAGES
and ORGANS.
The body is a working machine, and like all other
machines wears away in use. Our bones and muscles, so firm
and strong, need constant repair to keep them so. For this
purpose food is necessary, and a series of instruments or
organs by which it may be changed into flesh and bone. We
are, therefore, furnished with teeth to chew, palates to taste,
stomachs to digest, livers to aid digestion, and bowels to carry
off the refuse matter. The Liver is the very gateway of
health, the sewage farm, where the poisons are neutralised by
the action of the bile ; it exerts an all-powerful influence on
the mind, temperament, and disposition. If your Liver is
active you are happy and light-hearted, if sluggish you are
crabby and miserable. Kutnow’s Powder will keep the
liver in perfect order.
fm ■
Important Caution!
All respectable Chemists sell Kutnow’s Powder, but there are others ,
who, for the sake of a little extra profit, will attempt to foist upon
you some cheap imitation of their own. It is well known that
these cheap concoctions are highly dangerous, and in the case of
delicate, sensitive persons capable of inflicting permanent injury.
Kutnow’s Powder is pure, painless, palatable, free from sugar, and
absolutely harmless. See that the fac-siinile signature, “S. Kutnow
& Co., Ld.,” and the registered trade mark, “ Hirschensprung, or
Deer Leap,” are on the carton in which the bottle is packed, and
also on the label on the bottle. This signature and trade mark
will alone insure your obtaining the
GENUINE Kutnow’s Powder.
CAPTAIN BARCLAY™
“Kirsteen, Cisbury Road, Brighton.
“ Gentlemen, —You kindly forwarded me
a bottle of your Kutnow’s Powder a short
time ago. I am very unwilling to testify
that things have worked wonders, but really
I cannot speak too highly of it. I have
suffered for years from constipation and liver
troubles. Your powder has done all that it
claimed, and more than that, it has given me
comfort. Its action is sure and gentle, and
at the same time certain, without any dis-
tressing effects. —Faithfully yours,
“ R. BARCLAY (Capt.).”
Dr. Tertius Marks w™,
(President of the Texas State Home Medical
Association; Medical Director of the G. A.R. of
the Department of Texas, Ex-Pension Medical
Examiner, U.S.A.J
“ Having tried your excellent preparation
(Kutnow’s Powder) personally, I am in a
position to say it is as good as it is possible
to conceive.”
Dr. I. N. LoVE wxoti:
Late Professor of Clinical Medical Diseases,
Marion-Sims College of Medicine and College
of Physicians and Surgeons, says:
“ Kutnow’s Powder stimulates the activi-
ties of the bowels and kidneys, it cleanses
the bowels, dilutes the urine, and flushes
out the kidneys in the most satisfactory way.
Thorough elimination is salvation, and there
is no better eliminator than Kutnow’s v Pow-
der. “I. N. LOYE, M.D.”

m
MEDICATOR.
Catarrh is inflammation of
the lining membrane of the.
nose and adjoining passages.
If this inflammation is not
arrested it invades the pas-
sages which lead from the
nose to the head, ears, throat
and lungs. It injures the
sight and hearing, destroys
ihe sense of taste and smell,
renders the breath offensive,
breaks down the affected tis-
sues, consumes the nasal car-
tileges, and rots away the
small frontal bones of the
skull. The discharge,passing
through the lungs and sto-
mach, causes dyspepsia, also
consumption. Do you want
relief and cure? If so, try

Beanie’s Bronchitis Cure.
the famous remedy for
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, AND CONSUMPTION,
HAS THE LARGEST SALE OF ANY CHEST MEDICINE IN THE WORLD.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or
Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief ; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a Complete Cure. It is most com-
forting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has
never been known to exist where “ Coughs' have been properly treated with this medicine. No house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a Complete Cure is certain.
BKWARE OF COUGHS !
REMEMBER THAT EVERY DISEASE HAS ITS COMMENCEMENT, AND CONSUMPTION IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE.
BRONCHITIS.
A Sydney Stock and Share Broker expresses
Gratitude and Appreciation of Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure.
It proved a most effective remedy for a
severe attack of Bronchitis.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —I lately had a severe
attack of Bronchitis, and, acting- on the advice of a friend,
obtained a supply of your Bronchitis Cure. lam pleased
to inform you it has proved a most effective remedy,
causing me to feel grateful to you for furnishing such a
valuable medicine to the public. May you meet with the
success you so well deserve. I place this communica-
tion at vour service, and remain, Dear Sir, Yours
faithfully, HENRY FRENCH,
Stock and Share Broker, 93 Pitt-street, Sydney.
“asthma.
A Five Years case.
At times very bad indeed.
Quickly and completely Cured by Hearne’s
Bronchitis and Asthma Cure.
Mr. Hearne. Dear Sir,—For five or six years I was
troubled with asthma, at times very bad indeed. 1 was
very ill just after Christmas, so sent to the local chemist
for a bottle of your Bronchitis and Asthma Cure. I took
the first dose on going to bed, and was not troubled that
night. I finished the medicine, and have not had a
touch of the asthma since. I tell everyone about it.
M. MURRAY.
Postmistress, Pampoolah, Manning Riv r, N.S.W.
HAY ASTHMA.
A Severe Attack Believed in Ten Minutes
by Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
The Effect was Wonderful.
Mr. W. G. Hearne Dear Sir, —About three weeks ago,
while in the vicinity of musty chaff, I gradually felt
a difficulty to breathe. My nose began to run, and to all
appearances I was developing a severe attack of Bron-
chitis or Asthma. At last I could stand it no longer. I
then tried your Bronchitis Cure, and its effect was
wonderful. In less than ten minutes I was all right
again. Such a result, and so quick, astounded, me.
This is no exaggeration, I am pleased to say.—Yours
truly, S. H. MAYO, Meredith, Victoria.
BRONCHIi'IS and ASTHMA.
A Sydney Resident Suffered for Over Sixty
Y ears.
So Bad He Dared Not Stir.
Relieved in a Few Minutes by Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure.
Would Give £5O for the Same Benefit rather
than Suffer.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.
Dear Friend, —Chronic Bronchitis I had from birth, and
I am now 66 years old. Some time back I contracted
Asthma, and for months I was so bad that any remedy
that had previously relieved smothering- was of no use to
me. I was so bad that I dared not stir, and spent the
worst night I ever had. When, in a conversation, Mr.
Marsh, J.P., of Balmain, Sydney, kindly told me that a
friend of his was using your Bronchitis Cure, and that it
was good. So my sister bought me a bottle of it, and in
a few minutes after taking the first dose I could breathe a
little. The next day I was better, and kept getting better
every day. To-day lam better than I have been for the
last seven years. I took the medicine as directed, six
bottles, and it cost me less than £l. I would give £5O for
the same benefit rather than suffer as I did. Please make
what use of this letter you think fit. If by so doing it
would only cause one to get rid of this fearful complaint.
—Yours faithfully,
WILLIAM CANHAM,
108 Curtis Road, Balmain, Sydney.
HEARNE'S BRONCHITIS CURE.
Its Efficacy in chest complaints testified to
by a Grateful Victorian.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir,—l have much pleasure in
adding my testimony in praise of your invaluable Bron-
chitis Cure. I have used it for the last three or four years,
and its efficacy I have fully proved in common colds,
severe colds, croupy coughs, and other similar chest com-
plaints. I have given it to infants a few weeks old, young
children and adults of all ages, and have never known it
to fail in relieving at once, and rapidly effecting a cure
with a few doses. I have recommended it to many of my
friends, and they have fully proved its wonderful curative
properties. I feel very grateful to you for a chest medi-
cine so valuable, and cheap enough to be available to any-
one. Trusting its present popularity and sales will be
doubled, I am, yours very gratefully,
EDWARD JONES,
Mount Bruno, Mokoan, via Glenrowan, Vic.
BRONCHITIS-
An English Lady so ill that the Doctor
held out no hope.
Was given Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and it
effected a complete recovery.
Mr. Hearne. Dear Sir.—Not long since I had occasion
to visit the old country, and before leaving Melburne pur-
chased a bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, which I took
with me. When I arrived in Leeds I found that my niece,
Miss O. Matthews, was suffering from a very severe attack
of Bronchitis, in fact, she was so had that the family doctor
held out no hope of her recovery. She was then given
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure according to the direction on
the label, and I am very pleased to say that it effected a
complete cure. R. J. MATTHEWS,
c/o Allan & Co., Collins-st., Melbourne.
ASTHMA.
A Sufferer 73 Years of Age cured by Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure.
Sir,—f am thankful to say that-the medicine you sent
for asthma has had a wonderful effect. I have not taken
all the Bronchitis Cure, as I did not need it ; therefore
I send you my hearty good wishes for your future success.
I myself will, for the benefit of others, make it known to
all I know. Xam 73 years of age.—Yours truly,
JOHN BRAY,
Alliance-street, dunes, Victoria.
BRONCHO-PNEUMONIA.
Two Severe Cases cured by One Bottle of
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —Kindly forward without
delay another small bottle of your Bronchitis Cure. The
bottle I had from you has cured two of my children, but I
do not feel safe without it in the house. I have also re-
commended it to my friends. I lost a fine little girl, three
years of age, from influenza and Broncho-Pneumonia. I
really believe if I had had your medicine my child would
not have died, for the other two, a boy five years old, and
a baby 8 months old, were suffering exactly in the same
way, and it acted like magic on them ; in fact, a small
bottleful cured both of them ; so trusting you will forward
it without delay—l am, yours most gratefully,
(Mrs.) E. D. WARD.
Cassilis, via Swift’s Creek, Gippsland, Vic.
A Queensland Sufferer from Bronchitis.
Seventy-two years of age, weak and
Wasted.
The Doctor considered it a hopeless case.
Cured by Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Mr. Hearne. Bear Sir, —I beg leave to draw your
attention to a remarkable Cure of Bronchitis, which disease
attacked me last May. It was looked upon by the doctor
as a hopeless case. In such an extremity I naturally
looked about for something to try. I thought it a hard
thing, after 72 years’ experience of the ups and downs of
this life, to die in such an inglorious manner ; besides, I
was very poor in flesh, and thin, and this stimulated me
to make an effort for recovery, if only to improve my con-
dition. I saw your Bronchitis Cure advertised, and
thought I would give it a trial, so I sent to W. H. Harris,
chemist, Gill-street, Charters Towers, and got a small
bottle of it. I had scarcely finished it when I gave up all
thought of leaving my wife a widow, and hopefully looked
forwarded to many more delightful days of up and downs,
principally downs. The second small bottle caused the
Bronchitis and me to part company, greatly to its regret,
I opine. The third bottle stood me on my legs to receive
the congratulations of my friends.
I have been a resident of Charters Towers for 30 years,
and, being gifted with the spirit of good fellowship) have
not the least objection to you making any use of this
testimonial you think proper, as a means of relieving
others similarly situated to myself.
JOHN SHEPHERD,
Queenton, Charters Towers, Queensland.
Relieved by one dose of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and cured by two bottles.
Mr. Hearne. Dear Sir, —I wish to add my testimony
to the wonderful effect of your Bronchitis Cure. I
suffered for nine months, and the cough was so dis-
tressingly bad at nights, I was obliged to get up and sit
by the fire. I had medical advice, and tried other
remedies, without avail. I tried yours, and never had a
fit of coughing after taking the first dose, and though I
have had but two bottles, I feel I am a different man, and
the cough has vanished. You may denend upon my
making known the efficacy of your wondm'ful remedy to
anyone I see afflicted.—Yours faithfully,

Zam-Buk, and applied it in accord*

improvement was the outcome, and
I purchased a further supply, with
the result that the Eczema was

Go on the Land!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BE the backbone of the nation, go and do
your country good,
By clearing wastes of scrubland, and by
felling wastes of wood ;
Go and tear the mighty gum-tree from its place
upon the earth,
Where a howling famine rageth and there is a
water dearth.
Rise and excavate your birth-land; go, engage the
stubborn clod,
Till and plough the sterile country, make your
living from the sod ;
Eat your powder-bread and jumbuck in the mois-
ture of your brow,
Leave the carking care of cities —go upon the
country now !
There’s a luring prospect golden, where the long
leagues stretch away,
With a humpy sand-enfolden ’neath a sun that
shines alway;
There’s an everlasting desert stretching out on
every hand,
There are locust voices greeting him who goeth on
the land.
Rise and seek this famed Arcady—this Dorado
gaunt and slow,
Where the earth is grey with bunny and the sky
is black with crow ;
Go and taste the joys of Freedom and the whole-
some country air,
And recline beneath the shadows of the trees that
are not there.
Go and feel the dreamy romance of the handle of
the plough,
Go and draw the pallid fluid from the gently-
lowing cow.
Rise and sow the mangel-wurzel, and the turnip
and the wheat,
Far removed from all the bustle of the city and
the street.
Go and pit your manly vigor ’gainst the adamant
belar,
Rise triumphant o’er the terrors of the plough-
share and the bar.
Prove your lordship over fence-posts and long
coils of fencing-wire,
Where there are no trams and ’buses and no
theatres to tire.
Where the line of mulga stretches and obliterates
the view,
And the myall, and the gidya, and the spreading
beef-wood too;
Where the Mitchell, and the blue grass, and the
Bathurst burr are rank,
And the jumbucks and the cattle are a-bogging in
the tank;
Or a-floating on the current of the turbid, swollen
tide,
With the horses and the emus and the kangaroos
beside;
And the apple-wood and box-tree overtopple with
a thud,
’Neath the action of the water —rise and go upon
the mud !
Where the shimmering plainland stretches and
the phantom lakelets gleam,
And the palpitating heat-waves rise like colon-
nades of steam;
Where the scorching simoom bloweth, and the
saffron whirlwinds rise,
And dance like reddened witches with their wild
hair in the skies.
Where the lightning and the sun-rays, and the
camp-fire, all in turn,
Set the parishes ablazing—if there’s anything to
burn.
Where, according to the sages, you can always
earn a crust;
Quit the noisy, dirty city; rise, and go upon the
dust 1
It’s a grand and glorious prospect, fairly reeking
with success;
Rise, and go upon the country with much joy and
hastiness.
You’ll have plenty time for rueing, and for thoughts
of might have been,
Where the railway never reaches, and the mail-
man’s seldom seen.
Where the news of war or shipwreck, or political
debate,
Or events that shake the concourse very seldom
penetrate. •
Where the flattened everlasting meets the sky on
every hand—
Where, in short, there’s simply nothing, nothing,
nothing but the land !

DAVID H. RICHARDS.
In a Far Country.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Beyond the mountains blue,
Banished from the sea,
I dream old dreams anew,
And think, old friends, of you,
In a Far Oountree.
The wind that bends the trees
Bears no breath of brine ;
It has the sough of seas,
But ’tis not the brave salt breeze
That I loved larig syne.
At times in the dark woods,
When the stars are dim,
Its sound is like the rude
March of a multitude
To a battle hymn.
Old friends, old comrades true,
Whom I long to see,
In milk for mountain dew
I drink Was Hael to you,
In a Far Countree.
It is not such a Far Country from the point
of view of the Commercial Traveller ; and the
weather-beaten battler, who considers that a man
doesn’t begin to be Out Back until he arrives
at Bourke> would hardly consider it a step on the
way to the real West. But it is far enough for
me. lam only 200 miles away from Sydney by
train, and less as the crow flies, yet I feel as if X
were in the land east of the sun, west of the moon
I am satisfied I am no Zimmennann with a hun-
ger for solitude. The old hermits who dwelt in
the desert saw visions—most of them horrible. I
don’t wonder the old shepherds who live in lonely
huts in our own back blocks also see visions. It
is not good for man to always be alone. If I had
to live in a lodge in some vast wilderness I would
wish it to be a Lodge of the Royal Antediluvian
Order of Buffaloes—a friendly and festive society
as I remember it. Congenial company is as neces-
sary to a human man as tobacco. If you are
in low spirits it is the only real tonic. Half
your troubles disappear in the telling—as some
ancient sage observed on a brick in Babylon
several thousand years ago. Carlyle said over and
over again, in his diary, that a man should con-
sume his own smoke. His own attempt to do so
was a memorable failure. The reek of his troubles—
mostly affections of the nerves and the liver, for
which he refused to take pills—rose up black and
wrathful from his books, like the genie from the
bottle in the Arabian tale, and darkened the face
of Heaven. If he had encouraged men like Leigh
Hunt and Charles Dickens to come and chat with
him now and then, or if he had spent an occasional
ambrosial night, he would have been a better
teacher and a happier man. Tennyson was his
boon companion, however; Alfred, and he (as he
informs us) spent whole evenings together, saying
nothing, but glowering unutterable things, and
smoking, and thinking furiously up the chimney.
Mrs. Carlyle may have been a misunderstood
woman, but she made her ideas clear concerning
her curtains. Sage and poet seemed to agree that
there were no subjects worth discussion but the
Eternal Verities, and so forth, and that if nothing
profound and new could be said about them
they were better left alone. One is almost led to
suspect that the sage and poet were afraid of
trusting each other with their thoughts. A still
more unworthy suspicion would be that they were
silent because there was no Boswell present. But
they might have talked about different kinds of
beer, or whisky, or wine—all fruitful and inspiring
topics, if not treated too drily or abstractedly, as
it were. Silence that imagines itself to be pro-
fundity is simply a dark hole without any bottom.
There is certainly too much foolish talk in many
places, but if the entire English-speaking people
made a resolution and kept it, to speak wisely or
not at all, the English language, with the excep-
tion of a commercial jargon and a short vocabulary
of every-day words and primitive emotions and
appetites, would soon become as dead as Greek or
Latin.
It is pleasant at times, however, to have only
the trees and the birds, and the shadows in the
woods for company. Your brain'is quite clear
and vacant, or if thoughts come to it they are
what Edgar Allan Poe called “ unthought-like
thoughts that are the souls of thought.” You are
conscious of vague impressions merely. The
wheels of the mental machine are at rest. You
are not thinking of anything or anybody at all,
but just living. Afterwards you may remember
things you did not appear to notice particularly at
the time. One morning I walked through a spec-
tral wood full of tall ringbarked trees. The sight
was not new or strange to me, and I did not ex-
perience any emotion on the occasion. At night,
however, and not in a dream but simply in a
waking vision, I saw those white skeletons with
their crooked bleached arms outstretched—sinister,
frenzied, epileptic—and they seemed to me like
witches and warlocks blasted white by the wrath
of God at a Satan’s Sabbath.
I have tried, almost passionately, to take an in-
terest in pigs and calves and poultry, also farm-
life of all sorts, including bees. The bees warmly
reciprocated the warm interest I managed to take
in them, but the other animals were stolidly in-
different.
Ploughing is a pretty sight to watch when you
are not in a hurry, or craving for exciting amuse-
ments. A man is ploughing in a field on the side
of a hill over against which I am sitting at this
present moment. The four horses he drives move
steadily abreast, up and down the field, leaving
long, red furrows behind them. There is a look
of calm power m the movement which is very im-
pressive. Yet the horses of Messala in the chariot
race, with flaming eyes and flying manes, must
also have been a sight worth seeing. It all depends
upon the mood of the spectator. I have stood by
and watched men putting up a fence. That is not
an exciting spectacle. Neither is potato-digging.
Of course, one recognises that all these homely
farm operations are good works, and as such,
worth drayloads of prayers, and acts of faith, or
even devotional poetry ; but —I have seen enough
of them. 4 i
A farmhouse on a wet day is not a merry place.
A sullen veil of rain hides the fields from view.
You have to cover yourself with a tarpaulin if you
want to go as far as the woodheap. Macaulay
tells us that on such days (with snow instead of
rain) on a Roman farm in the brave days of old :
The girls are weaving baskets,
And the boys are shaping bows,
The goodman mends his armor
And trims his helmet’s plume,
And the goodwife’s shuttle merrily
Goes flashing through the loom.
On an Australian farm, as far as I have seen, the
girls are working the sewing machine and scouring
old pots and saucepans; the boys are mending old
harness ; the goodman is half-soling and heeling
his other boots; and the goodwife is putting a
patch on his other working pants. There is no
singing ; that is kept for special occasions, when
visitors arrive and the piano is opened. Perhaps,
however, there is as much poetry in our picture
as in the other. It is all a question of taste and
sympathy.
Many years ago a colony of stalwart Irish men
and women settled in this district. I don’t know
what part of Ireland they came from, but those
who are still alive —and that means the majority,
for this is a healthy section—talk with a brogue
as broad as the road. They began in a small way,
but all have fine houses and fine farms and fine
families now, glory be to God !
They talk about the Better Land in some far-shining
sphere,
But if you are of Irish blood you will be happy here ;
There’s Hogans and there’s Grogans here, and Gallaghers
galore,
And Collinses and Mullinses and Sweeneys by the score.
“ That big stone house upon the hill, who lives in it ? ”
said I.
“The Peter Mooneys,” Danny Bourke, my driver, did
reply.
“That house upon the flat there with the buildings all
around ? ”
“ ’Tis Rafferty’s,” said Danny, “ but the ould man’s in
the ground.”
“And those small old thatched houses with the walls
that look so low ? ”
“The, Irish lived in them,” he said—“’twas many years
ago.”
“ But smoke comes from the chimneys still; there’s
someone there, I vow.”
Said lie : “ Tis Some poor English do be livin’ in them
now.”

his face was laced with long, raw scratches, and
he had a crumpled ear. On the ground lay a
small female of about 40, whose mousy hair was all
over the footpath. She had a black eye and a
swollen lip, and seemed to be in an insensible con*
dition. Three or four women were.lamenting over
her, and administering whisky and other restora-
tives, while the rest of the crowd reviled the
sullen man for the loathly offence of “’ittin’ a

in his own defence : “ It was in fair fight, I tell

Australia was always dropsjcally disposed, and
more so half a century ago than^ to-day. In a
report sent by Dr. Bowman, of Sydney, to the
-London College of Surgeons, in 1830, dropsy was
mentioned as a particularly common complaint,
theory then current being that Irish whisky-
drinkers carried it out m their blood. “ Dropsy
mall its varieties, wrote the doctor, “is more
common here than in any other country I have
visited, which maybe accounted for by the dissi-

You Can Always Tell the Man
with Kidney Trouble.
The man with kidney trouble is cheerless in expression, sallow, and heavy-eyed. He is
easily irritated, excited, and worried over trifles, and nervous. His back troubles him
day and night—spoils his sleep, and makes him dizzy and faint after the slightest
exertion, He is rheumatic, dyspeptic, and hopeless. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
make the Kidneys well; they are the one medicine that is especially for kidney and
bladder troubles—the one medicine that cures men and women to STAY cured, and pro-
tects them against such advanced kidney complaints as Bright’s disease, diabetes, dropsy,
rheumatism, &c. Read the following cases of Sydney people who have been cured:—
SYDNEY TESTIMONY .
FROM WATSON’S BAY.
FROM REDFERN.
Mr. James Fotheringham, Watson’s Bay, late
6th Imperial Bushmen, writes : “Whilst in South
Africa with the 6th Imperial Bushmen, through
constant exposure to all sorts of weather, sleeping
in wet clothes, etc;, I got a very severe attack of
lumbago. I was so bad that I could not get up off
the' ground—let alone mount my horse. Two
military doctors had a go at me. One blistered
my back until all the skin was off ; and the other
gave me medicine, but neither of them did me
any good. Fortunately, a comrade came along
with a box of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and
before I had finished the box I was as right as ever
I was in my life. Since then I always keep a box
of the pills handy in case of the lumbago return-
ing, but, so far, I am glad to say, I have had no
necessity to take them. You may make whatever
use you like of this, as I consider Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills a boon to humanity, and I shall
always recommend them.”
Mr. W. B. Lewis, Viscount-terrace, Young-
street, Redfern, says:—“There is no more satis-
factory and really beneficial medicine that I know
of than Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. Much
sickness and broken time would be avoided,
especially by those who, like myself, are occupied
at outdoor work, if these pills were better known.
One of the many advantages in taking Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills is that they may be taken
with safety at any time. Having suffered for
some time, I was recommended to try them, and
found great relief. All of my friends to whom I
have spoken of their excellent effects speak in
similar terms of them. 1 have no hesitation in
saying that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are the
most comforting and the most certain to give relief
that I have ever used.”
Two years later, Mr. Lewis says “I still use
the pills—just a dose or two occasionally—and
they keep me quite right. I have recommended
this remedy to many, and they are praised by all
who use them. For my part, I would take no
other medicine.”

A June Wind.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OUTH Wind, South Wind, blowing chill
and free,
You are fleeting home to my home across the
sea,
Desertvvards, oceanwards, all a weary way,
From ice-breath, from sea-breath, to breath of the
hay.
Home along the pike road, rose-and-briar holden,
Home up the moor road, where the gorse is
golden ;
Home thro’ the coverts, dew-bright and blithe,
Home across the hay-grass, waiting for the scythe.
Here’s the land of sunshine —leaves upon the trees,
Slender, dark and withered, rustle to the breeze ;
Grass gnawed and wasted lies thin upon the plain,
Powdered by the westerly, parching for the rain.
Oh, the bloomy hay-grass round about my home,
Satin-smooth and rippled, sea without a foam,
Waiting for the South Wind, stirring as he passes
Gaily down the meadow, kissing all the grasses.
Sunshine ! sunshine ! and wide, wide sky !
Here’s the land of sunshine where my days go by;
Orange glows the dawning, silver falls the night,
Clear the air and shining, over-filled of light.
I know a hollow far across the sea
Where the dewdrops glisten ere the shadows flee ;
Where the shadows loiter, dappled by the sheen,
Wavering and tender, golden and green.
Yesterday I wandered through the staring noon
To the deep bush silence by the grey lagoon ;
I heard the frogs a-croaking, I saw the parrots
dart;
But, oh, the deep bush silence lay heavy on my
heart.
I know a streamlet far across the sea—
Ah, but the lisp of it calls the heart of me !
Singing through the woodland, dimpling in the
meadow,
Slipping like a live thing down by shine and
shadow.
Sudden falls the dark on the brightness of the
day;
The sunshine has perished and the South Wind’s
away;
Bush scents are wafted benea'th the quiet sky;
Crickets shrill gently—gentlier—and die.
Oh, the lazy twilight stealing on my home,
Smell of dewy hawthorn, smell of fresh-turned
loam;
Whispers in the stillness full of growing things.
And, hark! from a far tree a lonely night-bird
sings.
Hush ! lest I wake me. Nay, the dream is by.
Wide-reaching o’er me, the purple southern sky,
The Southern Cross a-gleaming in white glory
overhead,
Blurred to mine eyes by the tears I will not shed.
Q.
A. W.
Rebellious Suzanne.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rn hough censorious persons might
assert that we wear our moral code very
much unbuttoned in the South Seas, it
must be imputed to us for righteousness that we
were all more or less shocked at the little French-
woman. She came on board the steamer at Toad-
stool Hay, in the company of a Kanaka, two
vulgar green parrots, and a dreadful tortoiseshell
child. The Kanaka was super-fatted as the weed
on Lethe’s wharf, his eyes the color of stale stout,
his lips raw veal, his trade-box slop-clothes a
cumulative anathema. Nor did it need the look
of Pharisaical smugness in the missionary eye—
the eye that is ever bright with anticipating evil—
to make us think the very worst. A stern hum
of pious joy vibrated through the group of mis-
sionaries’ wives as a piebald child was produced
on deck, where, like the Cherubim and Seraphim,
it continually did cry.
It was the chief officer's first voyage on a copra-
waggon, and he was making very bad weather of
it. He had joined in Sydney from aP. and O.
boat, where, it was said, the captain was averse
to his officers being too attentive to the very nicest
girls. He was a pleasant young man, with a
crease down the front of his trousers, and when
he saw the Frenchwoman’s menagerie coming
aboard he said “Haw ! ” very emphatically. But
for the relief afforded him throughout the voyage
by the use of that blessed word, I fear his reason
would have tottered on its throne.
The little Frenchwoman, charmingly dressed
and booted, tripped gaily on deck, threw a com-
prehensive glance at the dowdy piety of the
missionaries’wives, and an appreciative smile at
the chief officer’s gold lace and air of regal pomp,
and disappeared into the saloon, leaving the terra
cotta child to its fate. The Kanaka’s attempt to
follow the lady was resented by so furious a
“Haw !” from the P. & O. man that he slunk
forward to join the colored crew. The infant—
something between a heathen god and a curried
monkey—shrieked disapproval of everything.
Meanwhile, the missionaries’ wives had deter-
mined to probe the matter to the utmost, and
a mother in Israel was convened as a deputation
competent to cross-examine in the Scottish tongue.
Bearing down on the chief, this really excellent
woman interrogated him in a winning Glasgow
voice that would have made its rolling periods
audible at a goose-fair or in a brass foundry.
The voice was distinctly heard by all hands
and the cook. But he baffled her, and I
glowed with a holy joy when 1 saw that truculent
missionary female recoil in impotent fury from
his vacuous smile and general intangibility.
From original scientific research made by my-
self during the day, I heard the Frenchwoman’s
story—not altogether a new one, but rare of its
kind. Her husband was an officer in the French
army, and was sent to New Caledonia with his
regiment. Then he was recalled to France for a
few months, and left his wife in Noumea until his
return. From Paris stories of his amusements
came from time to time, and at last, and while he
was on the way out, rebellious Suzanne decided
that what was sauce for the gander was sauce for
the goose, so she gathered up bag and baggage,
and tripped off gaily to the outer Hebrides.
There she lived in a tiny hut for two years, in
hourly expectation of being murdered by the can-
nibals who were her only neighbors. That is
what she told me, but then I am not a missionary.
As the night crept slowly up from the sea I
heard Suzanne telling her story again. She was
the centre of the missionary circle, and in very
indifferent beche-de-mer patois she related the
story of her flight from an infidel husband. Driven
to despair by his scoffs at religion, she had fled,
accompanied by a faithful servant, and a poor
orphan child adopted when its parents died of
fever. She was vigorously sucking a peppermint
and the tears were in her eyes, whether caused
by the strength of the Scottish confection or her
violent emotion it were hard to say. Dear, brave
Suzanne ! she could have given Sapphira 71b. and
a beating over any line of country. She had her
failings, it is true, but a woman more singularly
free from moral bias I never met. '' You God-
dams”—l regret to say that this was her synonym
for the Briton who “never, never,” etc. “you
Goddams have not the abandon of the French.”
I could not deny it. I said, “You certainly are
the most abandoned young woman I have met for
some time.”
We landed her on another island, after she had
convinced the steward that she considered his
presenting her with a wine-bill was an ill-
timed jest. On French steamers, drinks are free,
and Suzanne would not, and did not, conform to
the stupid customs of the Goddams. “My
faith ! but no.” The supercargo passed the rifles
through a port into her boat so that the mission-
aries might not br shocked by seeing the sinful
traffic in arms going on under their noses. The
man-of-war is considered a sufficiently signifi-
cant intimation to the heathen that they must not
take the precepts of Christianity too literally.
It was years before I saw Suzanne again, and
she was then somewhat reticent as to the ancient
Kanaka and that dreadful child whose likeness to
a curried monkey was positively haunting. But
she had still the “ abandon ”of her country. A
white man loomed faintly in the distance. “ Nar-
cisse,” she explained, “is full of the spirit. Not ”
—she added encouragingly—“that the Goddams
are altogether bad ; but me, I prefer what you
call man-a-oui-oui. My faith, yes.”
She still, I believe, flits through the summer
isles. Now it is Narcisse, and now Alphonse, but
always the “abandon.” The French man-o’-war,
which formerly discouraged her, now oidy shrugs
its shoulders. But she gets no more peppermint
lozenges from the Scottish missionaries. And she
grows of a stoutness, does Suzanne, having waxed
fat as the result of free living. Also, there are
many kicks in her yet. Nor does one expect such
as Suzanne to greet the dawn with pink cheeks
and bright eyes, like a baby fresh from its chris-
tening. Night and the hour of absinthe see her
at her best. She fades in the strong light, and
her eyes are then like yesterday’s fish.
J.G.M.
Some of the agricultural personages who
came to Melbourne for the Show were very care-
fully described on their visiting cards. The paste-
board of a country J.P., for instance, had the
word “over” printed at the right-hand corner,
under liis august name. The other side of the
card gave a list of his official distinctions. He
was three different sorts of justice of the peace,
including the sort “for consenting to marriage of
minors.” Also, he was president of a Pastoral
Association, and Hon. Agent of a Society for the
Protection of Animals. An ordinary citizen is
evidently expected to drop paralysed when he
exchanges cards with a potentate of such im-
mensity.
Amy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was in the days when the slimness of
my salary forbade tram-fares that I first
saw Amy. Probably that wasn’t her name,
but Amy has a nice soft sound, and it seemed to
suit her, somehow or other. Anyway, I always
called her that when I communed with myself
about her. She used to tramp into work the same
as I, and I fell into the habit of walking as near
behind her as I could without attracting too much
attention.
She was of medium height, and just verging on
woman’s estate ; that was denoted by her dress
ending at the tops of her boots. Her face was
oval, her cheeks like roses half a-bloom, and her
hair fell down her back—a torrent of newly-
minted gold. And her eyes ! I’ll have to give
her eyes best!
Once I made up my mind to speak to her, and
quickened my steps accordingly ; but when I drew
level with her a lump came into my throat and
nearly choked me. It was too much like sacrilege,
and I hurried on blindly. After that I was con-
tent to walk behind. To breathe the air around
her was more than I deserved. And so I
journeyed in my Amy’s wake for several months.
One morning Daune overtook me; he was in a
hurry. He caught hold of my shoulder, and half-
dragged me forward, and I passed Amy once
again. I saw Daune’s hungry eyes rove over her
insolently as we passed. He brought his mouth
down level with my ear, and said : “ Trim bit of
goods ! Trifle puggy in the snout, though.”
My fists clenched, and I think I could have slain
him had he been a smaller man. “Bit of goods”
and “ snout ” ! What an inartistic brute.
Amy worked in a big warehouse in Flinders-
lane—a warehouse where they make those white-
frilled things that women love so much. I used
to see her disappear into this gaol every morning;
then, with a sigh, I would trudge on to tackle my
own toil and to dream, when the boss was out,
of her.
But my chance came. How well do I remember
the Last Morning. I always call it the Last
Morning, although I have seen her many times
since. She had j ust reached the door of the ware-
house when she dropped her umbrella. I rushed
forward, picked it up, and returned it to her. She
turned her eyes on me, and they shot into my
heart and set it all afire. And then she spoke.
Oh, Amy, why did you ever speak?
“Now, that’s what I calls real’andsome. ’Arf
the would-be toffs yer sees wouldn’t stoop to pick
up a workin’ girl’s brolly. Yer a decent sorter
bloke, you are. Well, I mus’ go an’ do me little
bit fer a crust now. So long—an’ thank yer ! ”
Her eyes rang-off. She turned and tripped up
the steps, and the tomb of a warehouse engulfed
my Amy for ever, for I saw, through a blinding
mist, my idol broken into a thousand fragments.
But in my memory is another tomb, where a
more grammatical Amy still lies enshrouded in
state waiting the awakening.

Could Not Sleep
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla and Pills Bring Back the Appetite, Insure Restful
Sleep, Give Energy. Felt Twenty Years Younger,

Mr. A. Moyes, Franklin St.,
Adelaide, So. Australia, sends us
his photograph, and says:
“I feel sure that it is to Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla and Pills that I owe
my good health. Previous to
taking this medicine, I had no
appetite and suffered from loss
of sleep. I had no energy to do
or to go anywhere. The doctor
told me to go away for a change.
I did so, and I did not feel any
better after coming back. I came
to the conclusion it was old age
coming on me. Anyhow, I soon
altered my opinion after taking
the Sarsaparilla and Pills. Now
I can eat and sleep well; in fact,
I feel twenty years younger. And
when West I need never fear the
diet one has to put up with on the
fields, when my medicine-chest
contains a bottle or so of Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla and Pills.”
Why is it that Ayer’s Sarsaparilla is such a strong nerve tonic ? Why is it
that this family medicine brings back the appetite, makes the nerves steady
and strong, and gives sound and refreshing sleep? The answer is easy.
Because it removes the impurities from the blood which irritate the nerves
and keep them in a restless and weakened condition. When fed with pure
blood, the nerves settle right down to their regular duties; the train,
stomach, kidneys, and heart all do their work as nature intended.
To get these results you must take Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, not some other
kind. The market is full of imitations.

The Milk Foods closely approximate in composition to
human Milk, the natural and therefore best nourishment for
the young infant
They are as easy of digestion as maternal milk, and
provide a perfect diet for the formation of firm flesh and
strong bones.
The. Milk Foods are absolutely free from any noxious
germs, and hence are far superior to cow's milk as obtained
in towns.
No diarrhoea, digestive or stomach troubles ftelfl be feared
from the use of the “Allenburya" Food#.
The Milk Foods can be made in a moment hot water
only being necessary.
The “Allenburys” Foods are so graduated as to provide
the maximum amount of nourishment that the child is able
to digest at the periods of life for which the foods are re-
spectively recommended. For the robust and delicate they
are alike suitable.
