builds a better vinyl floor
Better building starts from the floor. Modern vinyl floorings are deep in colour, easy to clean, scuff and scratch
proof. Because they’re made with Geon, their pore-free surface is resistant to dirt, dust, oils and solvents.
Today, more and more manufacturers are using Geon in vinyl asbestos tiles, flexible vinyl tiles and sheetings.
In any industry, Geon’s versatility helps break the stalemate to product improvement. Have you a product we
can improve or develop?

“9 gallons of
humidity
my clients didn’t
suffer today”
Humidity is probably costing you
“buckets”! No matter what type of
business you own or operate, heat and
humidity take their toll of your net profit
figure every year. Kelvinator Refrigerated
Air Conditioning could be the business
booster you’ve been searching for. By
quickly reducing heat and dispelling
humidity it provides year-round comfort
conditions for your clients—a competitive
advantage that pays off.
Unlike air coolers (which actually in-
crease humidity) a Kelvinator unit removes
up to 9 gallons a day, because it is a
refrigerated unit.
Completely automatic, it ventilates, ex-
hausts stale air and smoke, circulates and
filters fresh air, and provides the most
economical method of winter heating, too!
How about it? If humidity is costing
you “buckets”, why not investigate Kel-
vinator Refrigerated Air Conditioning. (Just
mail the coupon below.)
P.S. Smart, unobtrusive Kelvinator units
are available from only £lB9 each. (Costs
as little as ninepence a day for your
initial investment.)

THESE TRAINS
MEAN BUSINESS
From the Gulf to Derwent River . . . from the shores of Sydney Harbour to the Darling
Ranges in the West. . . the freight trains of Australian Railways are constantly at work on
a never ending collection and distribution of the nation’s wealth. Much of it concerns the
great primaries from which we draw our daily sustenance, as well as export wealth the
bounty of our pastures, the fruit of our orchards, our great mineral resources.
These trains mean business ... in the
field of land-based transportation, nothing
matches rail over medium or long distance
hauls. No other land transport agency on
a ton-mile basis carries freight at such low
cost or so speedily.
Support for the Railways of Australia is
something more than just good business.
In a country of great distances, where
transport costs are higher than in most
other countries, the government-controlled
rate structure of Australian Railways is a
sound and basic common denominator, one
which works as it has done for over a
century for the betterment and benefit
of all Australians.

A catty* of fresh
prawns, prize garoupa or perhaps some green vegetables.
An open air fish market on the water in Hong Kong.
Part of the way of life for some 130,000 ‘Water People’
who live practically all their life on board a junk or a
sampan. This is just one facet of Hong Kong, the
cosmopolitan land of contrast. With a population close
to the four million mark in an area of only 398|- sq.
miles, Hong Kong offers you the experience of a lifetime.
From the tax free bargains in the shops to the open
areas of the New Territories, from the panoramic view
of one of the world’s greatest natural harbours—■
seen from the top of the Peak—to the hustle and bustle
of downtown Hong Kong there is a never ending wealth
of new adventures for the visitor and resident alike.
So for the holiday that’s different, that will be rewarding,
visit Hong Kong. Take a Hong Kong Vacation. If
you’re on a business trip, plan your itinerary so that you
can spend some time in Hong Kong. You’ll be glad you
did. For further information contact the Hong Kong
Tourist Association, Anchor House, 234 George Street,
Sydney or P.O. Box 2597, Hong Kong.

National Notebook
Battling The Beatles
Cir Malcolm Sargent is an impec-
cable dresser, who says with plea-
sure that he was once likened to “an
immaculately furled flag”. And, appro-
priate to the flag image, over the years
the English conductor has broken out
his battle standard against modern music
in general and pop packages in particu-
lar. But now, at 69, he is mellowing.
He hasn’t reefed in his crusading ensign
yet, but he has dipped it just a little . ..
Sir Malcolm, in Melbourne to con-
duct the Victorian Symphony Orchestra
last week, confessed that he had grown
to like the Beatles. “I must say I en-
joyed very much meeting the Beatles at
a recording session in London recently,”
he said, “and on their side they didn’t
seem too displeased to meet me.
“As a matter of fact I asked them for
their autographs.” And did they return
the compliment? “That doesn’t matter,”
Sir Malcolm said.
He said, thoughtfully, that it was to
be said in their favor that they had
brought a certain amount of vitality to
music. “They have a kind of rude,
honest charm,” he said. “Quite English
in an old-fashioned way.”
I The “rude, honest charm” is some-
thing Sir Malcolm is using to beat the
Beatles. He says a Beatle atmosphere
of enthusiastic informality can be genera-
ted at “prom” concerts to woo young
people to the classics.
“It’s all a matter of exposure and
attraction,” he said. “You have to use
the best methods available to win under-
standing and loyalty.” Meaning, you
might say, that if you can’t get people
to salute your flag— try changing the
flagpole.
Ahead Of His Time
painter Use Tauber was at our
side a few moments after we
walked into the Godfrey Miller exhibi-
tion at the new Darlinghurst Galleries.
“I studied under him for a year at the
East Sydney Tech. - ’, she told us. “And
now I am having my own exhibition
next month. I should be excited but all
I can think is that I really should with-
draw every painting after seeing this.”
Little else but Godfrey Miller was
talked about at the opening of the exhi-
bition of the paintings he had left in his
estate (along with more than £100,000).
Mr Dennis Colsey, an owner of the gal-
lery, said he would have paid hard cash
for the privilege of opening his new
place at Darlinghurst with the Miller
exhibition. “He was a wonderful, won-
derful artist. No critic would dare to
pan these paintings. It would mean they
were finished as critics if they did,” he
asserted. Mr Colsey allowed himself a
cynical reflection about whether there
would have been quite so much enthu-
siasm were Godfrey Miller a young,
live artist instead of an old, deceased
one. “He was so much ahead of his
time: at least a decade,” he explained.
One thing intriguing those who would
be in the know was exactly how the
paintings had all been sold prior to the
exhibition’s opening. We learned that
none of the exhibition has yet been
sold at all but each painting has been
reserved by a buyer, mostly the galler-
ies, who has been approved by at least
three close friends of the late Mr Miller,
including a member of his family.
A Tinge of Sadness
TV/Ir Lloyd O’Neil of Landsdowne
Press was recently in Sydney from
Melbourne for the launching of his
firm’s “Gold Medal Girl”, the story of
Dawn Fraser, as extracted from the
swimmer by Harry Gordon. “She’s not
exactly articulate, you know,” Mr
O’Neil explained. Mr O'Neil hopes that
“Gold Medal Girl” will sell about 30,000
copies throughout the world, but knows
that within a year the book will be
finished.
In the same week, because Australian
publishers tend to be all things to all
men, Mr O’Neil delivered a paper at a
literary seminar at New England Univer-
sity, Armidale.
Lansdowne, still consisting mainly of
O’Neil and an assistant, is the youngest
and the smallest of the Australian pub-
lishing houses. It began in 1960 with the
publication of “How to play Australian
Rules Football.”
But the brave flag which O'Neil ran up
then has already been lowered. In 1962
F. W. Cheshire’s took over the share-
holding but left O'Neil as a free agent.
Then a couple of months ago Wilkie’s,
the Melbourne printers, and the British
firm, International Publishers’ Corpora-
tion, an offshoot of the übiquitous Lon-
don “Daily Mirror”, took over the
Cheshire shareholding. This linked three
Australian publishing houses, Cheshire,
Landsdowne and Jacaranda, a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Wilkie’s.
Mr O’Neil admits to feeling a “tinge of
sadness” at the takeover, partly by for-
eign firms, of Australian publishers. How-
ever, he takes the optimistic, and perhaps
realistic, view that it is % the publishers’
independence their ability to go ahead
and publish the books they want to
which is their chief asset, and that no
new owner would be foolish enough to
destroy this asset.
“I feel confident that Lansdowne will
now have increased resources,” he said.
“But at the same time we may reduce
some costs, such as distribution. Perhaps
we will all eventually be under the one
roof, but we must keep our identity. Pub-
lishers don’t respond very well to re-
pression.”
Mr O'Neil has no worries that the first
essential in publishing that books get
published, in the sense of minority, or
majority, voices being heard— remains
safe under the new arrangement. He
also has no fears that any foreign con-
trol can turn back the tide which now
runs fairly strongly in favor of Australian
authors. No matter who owns Australian
publishing houses, or, in fact, if any exist
at all, Australians will still want to buy
such books as Donald Horne’s “The
Lucky Country” or Patrick White’s “The
Burnt Ones’’ at Christmas and the public
will continue to be given what it wants.
Mr O'Neil feels that British or Ameri-
can interest in the Australian book trade
means greater competition for authors,
although he agrees that this isn’t such a
bad thing from every point of view. In
general, he feels that perhaps too many
books are being published everywhere
but hasn’t any precise ideas about how
you go about publishing fewer.
Even as he is being swallowed up by
the giants Mr O’Neil continues to protest
"Schizophrenia? You must be out of your mind!"

Prodigy
r I '() be called an infant prodigy is a
-*■ sofcial disadvantage since the word
got round that prodigies never come to
much anyway. It's no good to counter
with the idea that Mozart was playing
and composing at four. He died poor,
didn't he? In Melbourne the latest
child to get the label is just over 10.
He is Geoffrey Tozer of Malvern, a
chubby but sturdy pianist with fair hair,
blue eyes and an impressive savoir faire.
His playing of Haydn at an Astra
Chamber Music Society concert at the
Myer Music Bowl won encores and fer-
vent admiration. He also plays Beetho-
ven, Bach and Bartok. He composes
for the piano and violin, and plays the
organ. Among things musical he de-
tests can be lumped the atonalists, the
serialists and the Beatles. They have no
part in the four hours of practice he
puts in each day.
In his non-playing hours he reads
Shakespeare and Shaw, does oil and
other paintings. Geoffrey's only teacher
has been his mother, Mrs Veronica
Tozer, who was born in England and
was a concert soloist before the war.
The refreshing part about prodigy
Tozer is that, despite the admiration, he
thinks of his future with some reserva-
tions. He doesn't feel that he can pro-
mise yet to become an international
celebrity as a solo performer. But fail-
ing that he'll settle for conducting or
composing.
The last Lancaster
QJydney solicitor, Mr Bruce Miles, rep-
resenting the British Aircraft Preser-
vation Society, told us last week that
only lack of finance is delaying plans to
fly the last airworthy Lancaster bomber
from Bankstown airport to an aircraft
museum in Coolsdon, Surrey, England.
“It’ll cost the Society about £5OOO to
fly the bomber to Surrey via Djakarta,”
he said. The Society had funds avail-
able but this had to be used for main-
tenance of the Lancaster. He added that
the Society still hoped the flight would
take place in March or April to be in
time for the aircraft to be shown at this
year's Biggin Hill air display.
The Lancaster was originally donated
to the French Government during its
Indo-China war and since then has been
with the French Navy in New Caledonia.
The French Government donated the
aircraft to the Society and the French
Air Force flew it to Sydney.
Onarim Churchill
\ s some concern was expressed about
the accuracy or otherwise of the
pidgin version of poster appeals for con-
tributions to the Winston Churchill Mem-
orial Trust we sought out an exact tran-
script of the New Guinea posters’ word-
ing. Under the heading “Onarim” (which
patently means what it sounds: “Honor
him”) there follows: “Churchill . . . Laik
bilong yu tasol . . . Halivim Australia
baiim ol kain skul long sampela man na
meri . . . Istap long Australia na arepela
kantri”. Former District Officer, Mr G.
Jensen-Muir, said in Melbourne that the
message translated accurately and baldly
as: “If you wish to help Australia, pay
for various types of schooling for some
men or women of Australia or other
countries.”
For a while there it looked as if the
Territory’s two million Papuans and New
Guineans might be being asked to sup-
port Australians, for a change. But an
official pidgin - English interpretation
issued from Canberra says the message
really states: “Give honor to Churchill as
he is one of your own people. Churchill
scholarships will send men and women
to Australia to learn and to other coun-
tries as well.” Which sounds more like it.
No Glossary
Qir Frank Richardson, as chairman of
Cox Brothers, is also GOC of
Georges. Therefore he promotes Vic-
toria’s most expensive art prize, the
Georges £lOOO. He is also the State’s
leading art baiter.
Last year before the assembled artists,
critics, and art lovers he thundered that
he didn’t know anything about art, nor
did he understand any of the pictures on
display. His advice to young artists was
this: if pictures needed a glossary or a
guide to explain what they were all about
they weren’t worth looking at anyway.
This year Sir Frank showed signs of
mellowing. He said: “You know there
are several pictures here I'd even hang
in my own home. Either artists are im-
proving or my tastes are becoming more
catholic.” -
Then he made the point which gave
greatest happiness to all present: “We
propose to continue this contest. This
is not Archibald nonsense. We are giv-
ing away prizes, 1,2, and 3.”
This meant £750 for Roger Kemp,
£250 for Jean Bellette and £5O for
Richard Crichton.
about the harm done to Australian pub-
lishing by Commonwealth Government
duties on the import of paper. This bur-
den he regards as far more of a threat
to those small voices of democracy or the
retention of a national identity than any
inrush of foreign capital.
Mr O’Neil is quite unashamedly proud
of his growing list of “prestige” authors.
Judith Wright has done children’s books
for him. He has commissioned Hal Por-
ter to do a book of drawings and text on
Sydney. A recent coup was to persuade
Martin Boyd to write his autobiography
for him. “I was reading ‘The Cardboard
Crown’ and I felt strongly how much of
it was autobiographical,” he said. “So the
logical step was to ask Boyd to write his
autobiography. It is to be called ‘Days of
My Delight'.”
“It's nice to have this side of it coming
along,” he added, “But often these books
don't butter much bread.” The books
which have buttered Mr O'Neil's bread
are Robin Smith's “Australia in Color”,
which sold 26,000 at £2 a copy in 12
months, Russ Tyson’s “Philosopher’s
Notebook”, which sold 25,000 copies,
and Bill Wannan’s compilations of Aus-
traliana. These may not be everyone’s
cup of tea but they do put a bit of jam
on the bread and butter.
THE SOUDAN WAR
ffifyulCetCn
80 Years Ago: February 28, 1885
/~h<Y havoc, and let slip the dogs
of war! New South Wales to
the rescue! Look at our Loyalty!
Please to admire our Patriotism
(patented, any imitation by other
people will be prosecuted). A thou-
sand a year to the patriotic fund for
crushing patriots! God bless our flag.
God bless our troops. God bless the
war. God bless the Devil broken
loose among us! Let’s go and help
kill some Arabs of the Soudan. It is
noble sport. They fight (for their
country, their liberty, and their
religion but no matter) like tigers,
and with just about the same sort
of weapons and the same chance
of getting the best of us. Oh! it
is inspiring. It is a gratifying
and heartwarming chance that the
first occasion in which Australian
colonists practically evince their
sympathy with the mother country
is when opportunity occurs of joining
heart and soul in an iniquitous war
against a people who have sought no
quarrel with England, and are simply
endeavouring to shake off the yoke
of the miserable Egyptian TEWFIK.
We will conclude with a sentiment,
and anybody who does not like it
may lump it. It is not “God bless
our troops”, nor “God save the
Queen”, nor “God prosper our arms”.
It is simply “God help the Right”
Sounds “unpatriotic” when you come
to think of it doesn’t it now?

PLAIN ENGLISH
Doctor Kennelly’s Shock Therapy
Alan Reid makes the necessary
point on page 14 of this issue
that Senator Kennedy is too realistic
to have believed that his call for re-
conciliation between the ALP and the
DLP is a likely possibility. Probably
neither party wants such a reconcilia-
tion. Certainly with its growing mem-
bership and two Federal Senators, the
DLP has shown that, given the
present sort of ALP which Dr Cairns
has boasted stands next to the Com-
munist Party, it can go on keeping it
out of power indefinitely. The ALP,
for its part, whatever the feelings of
some of its State politicians before
State elections, would, under its
present Leftist and pro-Communist
domination, rather cut its throat than
admit the truth in some of the DLP’s
charges.
What Senator Kennedy has been
ready doing is to act as the exorciser
of taboos saying the forbidden
words out loud in the hope that his
shock therapy might bring members
of the ALP in the branches, in the
trade union movement, and at the
State executives, around to an aware-
ness of the party’s fading grasp on
reality.
Instead of using the politically
dramatic moment of a declaration for
the Senate pod to cad for the unity
of two deeply divided parties, Senator
Kennedy could have written an article
for some unread ALP journal and
said, in Alan Reid’s words: “Let
us clean up unity tickets in trade
union elections, association with the
Communists and get rid of Communist
influence upon Labor’s foreign affairs
policy.” But who in the ALP would
have paid much attention? That mode
of criticism would have been no dif-
ferent from what many of his own
Parliamentary colleagues, including
Mr Gough Whitlam, have done in
the past. Since the ALP, or at least
its effective leadership, has long since
enfolded itself in its home - made
cocoon impervious to criticism,
Senator Kennedy would have earned
a few editorials and little else. Dr
Cairns and company would have
ignored him.
But Senator Kennedy has been in
the ALP for nearly half a century and
is steeped enough in the party’s folk-
lore to know how other leaders in the
past have had to force the party to act
against them to achieve their goals.
The party’s machinery must be set in
motion censuring, disciplining, de-
bating, voting —to such an extent
that the matter cannot be ignored.
But if it is Senator Kennedy who
sets the machinery in motion not
towards a merger with the DLP but
towards the necessary purge of the
ALP then it will be up to those
ALP members who would like to see
a responsible ALP making a serious
challenge for power, to keep it in
motion. They must ensure that
Senator Kennedy is not one isolated
voice. If that happens then it will,
ironically, have been a 61-year-old
veteran who rejuvenated the ALP
and not the custom-built, “youthful
image” Gough Whitlam, who has
talked so much and done so little.
The trouble is that even the veteran
Doctor Kennedy, for ad his shock
therapy, may find the patient beyond
revival.
Why Do They Bother?
"CVen the most enthusiastic critic of
censorship in due course gets a
bit tired of complaining about the
Customs Department. After all, even
he must admit that some of the books
Customs bans are of no moment —•
or certainly not enough to justify the
endless waving of the flag of absolute
freedom. Some, indeed, of the banned
books may reasonably be called evil,
as Charles Higham called “Candy”
in last week’s The Bulletin, and
while liberals usually say they prefer
to be free to expose evil rather than
to be protected from it, nevertheless
there are more important evils for
them to expose than obnoxious books.
Yet, having said all that, every now
and then the Customs Department or
the Commonwealth Literature Censor-
ship Board decides on an act of cen-
sorship which no one in his right
mind seems able to defend. The latest
is the decision to ban David Hol-
brook’s “The Quest for Love”. It
has been banned under Item 4A of
the Customs Regulations, which
means that the Department referred
it to the scholarly Censorship Board
in Canberra for advice and that the
Board recommended prohibition.
Holbrook, a Fellow of King’s
College, Cambridge, is a distinguished
English educator who has specialised
in the study of language teaching; he
is something of a Puritan and in
literary criticism is a disciple of Dr
F. R. Leavis. His latest book is a
scholarly (and puritanical) work about
“the sense of reality” and the capacity
to love, his argument
through a study of Chaucer, Shake-
speare and D. H. Lawrence. Like
every good disciple of Dr Leavis he
admires Lawrence but regards “Lady
Chatterley’s Lover” as a bad book;
and Holbrook’s study is an out-and-
out attack on “Lady Chatterley’s
Lover”.
Why on earth has it been banned?
One can only guess, since neither the
Board nor the Minister. for Customs
has to give reasons (beyond saying it
is “obscene”). The first guess would
be: because the book deals with
sexual intercourse. Yet this does not
make sense, since the market is
jammed with books dealing with that.
The next guess must be: that it quotes
many passages from “Lady Chatter-
ley’s Lover” in its attack on that book
the point being that the novel is
banned and therefore other books
containing long extracts from it must
also be banned.
At this rate there will be no end
to the absurdities. Already at least
one important book, C. H. Rolph’s
“The Trial of Lady Chatterley” is
banned for this same reason, although
it would be of real interest to both
literary scholars and lawyers. In due
course there will be scores of worthy
books examining Lawrence’s novel.
Are they all to be banned? It is in
this way that one foolish act of censor-
ship leads to a systematic .censorship
which makes the whole business in-
credibly stupid.
The most disappointing aspect of
this case is the Censorship Board’s
conduct. Originally it recommended
the release of “Lady Chatterley’s
Lover”, but the Government scorned
its advice. At least with Holbrook’s
book it might have stuck to its guns.


THIS AUSTRALIA
LABOR PARTY
What Kennelly
Really Wants
Not a DLP merger but an ALP purge
By ALAN REID
SYDNEY Personalities are cloud-
ing the fight in Labor. The struggle is
being depicted as between Labor Leader
Arthur Calwell and his Left-wing sup-
porters and the Deputy Senate Labor
Leader, Pat Kennelly, and his Right-
wing supporters. But the real struggle is
over policies.
Some shrewdheads in the Labor Party
are wondering whether Senator Kennelly
was “fair dinkum” in his advocacy of a
round table conference between the ALP
and Democratic Labor Party an ad-
vocacy that has brought down on his
head the hostility of his Federal Leader,
Arthur Calwell, and the ALP's Left wing.
But the important thing is that he has
pointed up the shortcomings of the ALP
which, in Kennelly’s view, will reduce
the ALP in status from a potential alter-
native government to “a perpetual op-
position”.
A political realist, Kennelly must have
known almost from the outset that a re-
conciliation between the ALP and DLP
is most unlikely. There were too many
policy points keeping them apart, policy
points that neither side could or would
be prepared to abandon. But as hostility
mounted against Senator Kennelly’s pro-
posal, Senator Kennelly has become in-
creasingly happy and urbane. It is almost
as though things are working out as he
planned them. For, from the Left wing
viewpoint, the most devastating thing
he can now say is: “Okay. You won't
accept my suggestions for a reconcilia-
tion with the DLP to prevent Labor de-
generating into perpetual opposition. Well
then, let's do what is obviously the only
other thing to do. Let us clean up the
things that make us vulnerable to DLP
attack. Let’s clean up unity tickets in
trade union elections, association with
the Communists, and get rid of the Com-
munist influence upon Labor’s foreign
affairs policy that always puts us in the
anti-American camp.”
Actually Kennelly’s timing on his ad-
vocacy of a round-able conference be-
tween the ALP and DLP was very nice.
It showed all the skill of an old politic-
al dog who has been through the mill
many times and who, when he has to
go through the mill again, arranges to
go through with a minimum of scars. On
the personal side, nobody can get at him.
He advocated ALP reconciliation with
the DLP at the declaration of the Vic-
torian Senate poll at which he had just
been elected for a further six-year term.
The Left wing can strip him of his deputy
Senate Leadership, his pre-selection, and
even the ALP ticket he has held for 50
years (if it is ruthless and reckless of the
consequences), but it cannot strip him
of his Senate forum. He has somewhere
from which he can tip, from a great
and privileged height, the innumer-
able buckets he has collected during a
lifetime -in the heart of Labor affairs.
On the political side, he made his
statement at a period when a large
number of the anti-Communist element
in the Party were “browned off” with
the way things w'ere developing. West-
ern Australian Labor Leader “Bert"’
Hawke showed this by coming out in
support of the Kennelly proposal in
flat opposition to the one-time czar of
the ALP Federal machine, Mr F. E.
(“Joe") Chamberlain, who is Western
Australian State Secretary and still con-
trols the Left wing forces which
dominate the ALP Federal Executive.
T>ut more than Hawke were “browned
** off”. Within the Federal Parliament-
ary Labor Caucus, feeling has been inten-
sifying against Caucus executive mem-
bers Dr Jim Cairns (who exercises a
major influence on the Victorian ALP
which is now out for Kennedy's politic-
al blood) and Mr Clyde Cameron (who
has strengthened his influence consider-
ably in South Australia which once used
to support the Right-wing States of NSW
and Tasmania). Caucus members are
bitter about the support Dr Cairns and
Mr Cameron have given Mr Pat Mackie
and the Committee for Membership Con-
trol (a Cameron instrument) in the Mount
Isa dispute against the ALP-officered
Australian Workers' Union. Caucus
members can see Mount Isa closed down
and control over development of North-
ern Queensland handed to the Com-
munist Party working through the Com-
munist-controlled Brisbane Trades and
SENATOR KENNELLY
Labor Council which is trying lo break
AWU power in the north.
Interestingly—and it is a sign of the
depth of ideological feeling on this issue
it is not the decision of the AWU to
withdraw all financial support from the
Federal ALP until Dr Cairns and Mr
Cameron are disciplined that is respon-
sible for the feeling against Dr Cairns
and Mr Cameron. What is really riling
is that when intervention has been pro-
posed against Communists in unions, Dr
Cairns and Mr Cameron have insisted
vociferously that ALP policy is non-inter-
vention in trade union affairs and the
ALP must stand by this policy even if
the unfortunate outcome is that through
Communist candidates the Communist
Party take control of key unions through-
out Australia. But when intervention is
against ALP controllers of the AWU,
probably the strongest anti-Communist
union in Australia, and the outcome
could be a break-through for the Com-
munist Party that might give it control
of this vital union, Dr Cairns and Mr
Cameron come out publicly in support
of the group led by Mr Mackie, an ex-
pelled member of the AWU.
Mr Pat Galvin, anti-Communist, tough
and determined to speak his mind even
though Mr Cameron is moving to a
position in South Australia where he
could be a decisive factor in deciding
whether Mr Galvin will retain his ALP
pre-selection at the next Federal elec-
tions, did not disguise either where he
stood or his feelings on this matter when
Mr Calwell ruled him out of order for
trying to get the matter raised at last
week's Parliamentary Executive meeting.
“If that's the way you want it I'll take
the matter into the Caucus,” said Mr
Galvin.
Senator Kennelly got the first fruits
of his stand in the reports of the Labor
Party Parliamentary Foreign Affairs
Committee which Mr Calwell issued as
an executive - approved declaration of
policy. Though it paid lip service to

some Left-wing-enforced foreign affairs
policy decisions made by the machine, it
was basically a Right-wing document. It
said Australian action to assist Malaysia
was justified. It endorsed US military,
action in North Vietnam. It said depar-
ture of US forces from South Vietnam
was not in the interests of the people of
South Vietnam or Australia.
These things will bring howls of
protest from the ALP's Left wing. The
Committee's reports were described as
“unanimous”, but they were not com-
piled without brushes. Captain S. Ben-
son, the Victorian MHR who com-
manded naval craft in World War II
and who does not see eye to eye with
some of his Victorian colleagues more
responsive to the Left-wing views of the
Victorian ALP Executive, was accused
of “talking like a Liberal” w'hen he put
a strongly pro-Malaysian viewpoint. A
member of the Committee who holds
similar views to Captain Benson inter-
vened toughly and promptly: “How
would you like it if I said you were
talking like a Communist?” he asked
Captain Benson’s accuser. Mr Allan
Fraser, Chairman of the Committee,
intervened, backing Captain Benson
against his accuser. “There'll be no more
of that,” he said curtly. From there on
the debate seemed to be lacking in
opposition and the final reports came
out as “unanimous”.'
Kennelly probably knows that all he
has to do is shift his line from reconcili-
ation with the DLP to internal reform of
the ALP and the forces within the ALP
uneasy about Communist influence on
the ALP will join with him for a clean-
up. His own approach is pretty clear. He
told one Victorian ALP Executive mem-
ber reproaching him for his advocacy of
ALP-DLP reconciliation: “Don't you
talk to me, brother. I know how you got
into this Party. With a 10s. ALP ticket
in one pocket and a unity ticket in the
other party.”
But Kennelly is probably also aware
that he has a long hard row to hoe be-
fore he gets anywhere and that the fight
could go on for a long, long time. It is
not without significance that in his now
notorious poll statement he referred to
the fact that it was his grandchildren he
wanted to have a life in Australia. Ken-
nelly, a realist, also recognises that his
fight is not with Calwell, whose basic
views are similar to Kennelly’s, but with
the forces that are shaping ALP policy
forces which lie outside the Party
room and lie deep within the ALP
machine.
STOCK EXCHANGE
“We Are Not Paupers”
Changing the ’Changes
MELBOURNE— The Stock Exchange
got rather more than it bargained for at
the symposium on Investment in Aus-
tralia when it invited Mr S. C. G. Mac-
indoe, a director of The Melbourne
Herald, its long-time and most dedicated
critic, to take a look at its workings. As
with Mr J. G. Wilson, managing direc-
tor of APM, who had earlier launched
a strenuous attack on foreign investment,
Macindoe taunted the exchange with
being a high cost monopolist institution
and brokers with having “too many
irons in the fire”. Only a philosophical
corrective from Mr Tom Fitzgerald
saved the day for the brokers.
If it achieved nothing else this open
clash between the “company” and
“broker” view on stock exchange prac-
tice and principles brought most of the
discontented rumblings to the surface.
Exchanges should not be any less zealous
in their reforms simply because some of
Mr Macindoe’s taunts in his attack on
them were based on a wrong-headed in-
terpretation of the functions of the
market. The most obvious of these was
his insinuation that brokers were flat out
to generate more business simply to get
rich quicker (“Admittedly we are not
paupers,” said one of them, Mr C. T.
Looker, of lan Potter and Co.). The
more business that can be put through
the market th'e better, not only for the
brokers but also for investors.
Where- the exchanges seem to have
failed dismally is in not reducing their
highly remunerative commissions in view
of the sharp rise in turnovers. Neither
Mr Macindoe nor any of the other
speakers at this session of the symposium
seemed to think that the establishment
of a national exchange i fi Canberra with
cut price commissions was the answer.
The exchanges themselves claim they
were aware of the problem some time
ago, and before the rebel exchange was
mooted. The results of their current in-
vestigations into the possibilities of mak-
ing drastic reductions in commissions are
awaited. The cuts had better be big.
Spokesmen for the Melbourne Ex-
change told the symposium that moves
were already afoot to meet Mr Mac-
indoe’s criticisms on two other matters.
One was to inject some non-broker rep-
resentation in the deliberations of the
stock exchange committee on the lines
of the New York Stock Exchange to
dilute the charge of monopoly.
Mr A. B. Mellor, the Melbourne S.E.
chairman has been getting advice on the
most appropriate form of outside rep-
resentation from Mr Keith Funston,
President of the New York Exchange
who addressed the symposium on
another subject. Another current move,
the spokesman said, was to tighten up
the stock exchange committee's surveil-
lance of brokers' circulars, which all too
frequently plug the stocks underwritten
by the firms which issue them.
As for Mr Macindoe’s well-sustained
charge that brokers should not be under-
writers an issue which The Bulletin

Annual output of the new Royal Aus-
tralian Mint at Canberra is 300 million
decimal coins 1.2 million coins per
day. Creating this currency involves the
melting and treatment of 2,500 tons of
silver, cupro-nickel and bronze ingots
each year. Two rolling mills breaking
down and finishing roll the metals
into strip form for the coining presses.
These mills are the largest units in the
Mint’s complex, money-making mach-

h.p. of ‘English Electric’ A.C. and D.C.
machines provides power for the mills,
which are Ward Leonard controlled.
The complete electrical equipment
for both mills was supplied, installed
and commissioned by ‘English Electric’
under sub-contract to the mill makers,
W.H.A. Robertson of Bedford. In addi-
tion to installing the electrical equip-
ment, ‘English Electric’ was responsible

has canvassed from time to time the
question was, who, in the relatively con-
fined financial circles here, would do the
job. Mr Macindoe’s answer was: the
growing number of merchant bankers.
Apart from the conflict of interests he
could see arising Mr Macindoe was not
convinced that local brokers had the
necessary expertise to do it, though Mr
Tom Fitzgerald pointed out that some

Piety Pit?
The Churches’ Newspeak
SYDNEY —In language which seemed
to owe more to scientific Newspeak than
to the Gospels, the report of the National
Christian Strategy Consultation Steering
Committee told of a new sense of ur-
gency among at least two major churches
about uniting the Protestant denomina-
tions in Australia. Summarising the re-
sults of the 1965 annual meeting of the
Australian Council of Churches under
the heading, “Highlights of Action and
Outreach”, the report carried the pro-
posals by the Anglican and Methodist
delegations calling for a covenant of
unity within five years and then uniting
as one Church within five to ten years
after that. These proposals, together
with a Council preamble supporting
unity in general terms, will now be con-
sidered by the Churches individually.
The members of the Council include
all the main Protestant denominations of
British origin as well as the Greek
Orthodox, the Antiochian Orthodox, the
Serbian Orthodox and the Armenian
Apostolic Churches. All are agreed on
the new ecumenicism but some Churches
are trying to hasten more slowly. The
Presbyterians, for instance, fear that the
latest moves may adversely affect their
own smaller-scale plans for unity with
the Methodists and Congregationalists.
What demonstrated the new mood of
urgency most strikingly was the way in
which the Anglican Church was prepared
to commit itself to union at a date even
earlier than the Methodists 1975 in-
stead of 1980. Generally in favor of
church unity but lukewarm on any real
action until now, the Anglicans seemed
caught up in a desire to do something
anything at all to ensure that the
Churches be able to meet the problems
facing Australia ten years from now.

but all leaders.
They all choose SELEX DECAL window transfers. Why?
Making transfers is a job for experts. To satisfy quality-conscious clients,
a transfer maker must be capable of doing the finest printing —lithe,
letterpress, or screen. He needs a plant almost hermetically sealed against
dust, and temperature-controlled to prevent stretching and shrinkage.
Another requirement is an expensively-equipped laboratory staffed by technicians
who can test the flow properties of different inks under different conditions...
lacquers and enamels too; establish what light does to different pigments;
determine the longevity of clear varnishes, the tenacity of hundreds of
different adhesives. He must have ruthless quality controllers and a racy
organization that gets the transfers into the advertiser's hands before the
campaign breaks. It takes expertise and a big operation. It takes Selex Decal

background of most discussions about
the ecumenical movement, probably sur-
prised his own diocese with the extrem-
ity, for him, of a call to Anglicans to
revise their ideas of the episcopacy and
the apostolic succession. Bishop Reed
of Adelaide, for long known as a scep-
tic on unity, actually moved the Angli-
can resolution.
The Anglican Archbishop of Perth,
the Most Reverend G. Appleton, made
this fervent appeal: “Suddenly we have
come to a moment of unity and inspira-
tion on this question. We must not let
unity and inspiration go.” What had hap-
pened to the C. of E.? One answer was
that this was the first Council meeting
at which it has been possible for the
effects of the traumatic Toronto Con-
ference of Anglicans in 1963 to show
themselves.
THE MOST REV. G. APPLETON
The main work of the Council was
based on two volumes of papers one
covering the likely pattern of social and
political change over the next ten years
and prepared largely by non-church spe-
cialists, the other dealing with a “stra-
tegy” for church activity in the same
decade, prepared by churchmen them-
selves. Three of the more seminal
papers were those by Dr J. J. Mol,
the Reverend John Garrett and the
Reverend Dr D. R. Merritt, all of
which added up to one general
conclusion that the Churches were ir-
relevant in the lives of most Australians,
that they had to revise their whole
notion of “social change”, and that unity
was essential if the Churches were to
play any significant part in preparing
their followers to live with the changes.
The attempts to get something practical
done at the conference are echoed in the
final report which states: “We were de-
termined that we should not fall in the
pit of pious resolutions”.

The Failures
A Halfway House
SYDNEY When Judge Alfred E.
Rainbow of the NSW Workers’ Com-
pensation Commission died suddenly in
December 1963 on the eve of a world
tour, the Archdeacon of Sydney in far
more than a ritualistic compliance with ob-
ituary etiquette, said that we had lost “a
great Australian”. For “Alf” Rainbow, a
former first-class, Rugby footballer and
swimmer, who had served with the AIF
in New Guinea, embodied many of the
legendary qualities. He was combative,
cynical, irreverent, humorous, warm-
hearted and utterly unpretentious. He
disliked personal publicity and until late
in life refused to have his name in
Who’s Who.
As a Judge in Divorce he denounced
the existing divorce laws as archaic and
hypocritical. At a public meeting he
said that Long Bay Gaol ought to be
blown up. In an interview he referred
to the Minister of Justice as stupid. When
another judge suggested that the three
Eastern States should set up an Aus-
tralian Alcatraz island he commented:
“I would be inclined to put judges who
think that way on the island.”
Amongst other things he was President
of the NSW Rugby Union, President of
the Australian Family Planning Associ-
ation, President of the NSW Prisoners
Aid Association and President of the
Australian Prison After Care Council.
So it is altogether appropriate that
the recently launched £lOO,OOO Judge
Rainbow Memorial Appeal Fund (to
which Sydney City Council has just
donated £1000) should be devoted to
the rehabilitation of ex-prisoners. It is
fitting, too, that the money raised is to
be used to establish Halfway Houses, for
it was Rainbow who first urged the need
for them in Australia. Not long before
his death he said he was prepared to
stand on a city corner and rattle a col-
lecting box himself to get one 'going in
Sydney. And one of the objects of his
world trip was to meet Merfyn Turner,
the founder of the Halfway House move-
ment in London.
Merfyn Turner, the son of a Welsh
Nonconformist minister, first encountered
the problem of prison after-care when
imprisoned as a conscientious objector
in World War 11. Subsequently attend-
ing the case committee meetings of a
Discharged Prisoners’ Aid Society he be-
came convinced that the emphasis on
purely material needs was frequently
misplaced. With many recidivist prison-

crs, he felt, the handicap of social isola-
tion, friendlessness, homelessness was
more crippling than any financial dif-
ficulty. Then, in 1954 on a visit to
Scandinavia he saw, amongst other in-
novations, the Kofoed’s School in Den-
mark where homeless men were helped
back into society. And the idea of the
Halfway House “halfway between
prison and society” was born.
The rationale of the movement is
simple. The incidence of homelessness
amongst persistent offenders is heavy.
Some have never known a home, begin-
ning in orphanages and graduating to
reform schools and prisons. In all cases
the more time spent in the prison, the
more isolated a man is likely to be on
discharge. Yet few of these men are the
vicious implacable enemies of society of
crime fiction. Having nowhere to
go when they leave prison, no family or
friends to exert a stabilizing influence,
they soon return to prison.
THE LATE JUDGE RAINBOW
Such men, even if anxious to lead a
useful life on discharge, need more than
work, clothes and money if they are to
break the cumulative sequence of social
failure. They need an anchorage, a place
to live where people notice their existence,
where they can learn to live with fellow
men.
This Turner set out to provide. In
January 1955 with Merfyn Turner as
warden and his wife as his assistant, Nor-
man House, the first Halfway House
was set up.
His achievement was remarkable.
During its first five years almost two
hundred men lived at Norman House,
for periods ranging from a few weeks
to two years; and, during those years,
only one man went back to prison while
he lived at the home. Now ten years
later a considerable number and variety
of similar establishments have been pro-
duced. The British Government is now
supporting them with grants.
Until recently, however, the movement
had no counterpart in Australia. One ex-
ception to this generalization is the Era-

maus experiment, a trial project under-
taken in Victoria in 1963-64. This was an
attempt to provide something very simi-
lar to a Halfway House (although it
originated quite independently of Tur-
ner’s movement) for young men between
the ages of 17 and 21 on release from
Victorian prisons. Sponsored by the
Anglican Chaplain to prisons and sup-
ported by the vestry of St. Luke's North
Fitzroy, who paid the rent, it ran for
twelve months. It is now closed tem-
porarily for an evaluation.
The first Halfway House in Sydney
(to be called Rainbow House) is to be
set up at Bankstown under the auspices
of the Bankstown Civil Rehabilitation
Committee. It is estimated that the cost
of the first house will be around £25,000.
A second house for women is planned
as soon as funds become available.

No Bucking
the Barrier
The Broken Hill Monopoly
BROKEN HILL One of the facts of
life you learn when you come to Broken
Hill is that you can’t buck the Barrier
Industrial Council. An Adelaide firm,
Solomons Floor Coverings, has cur-
rently been finding this out the hard way.
Despite the BlC’s long-standing ban
on outside salesmen, Solomons recently
began soliciting business by sending
door -to - door salesmen to the city.
Promptly, the BIC declared the firm
“out of bounds” to all unionists. On the
Barrier, the law is that no firm can do
business unless it establishes a shop, em-
ploys union labor and operates accord-
ing to union conditions.
Solomons, however, were not to be
beaten. Establishing an agency at the
tiny settlement of Cockburn, just over
the SA border 30 miles away, the firm
advertised in the Adelaide Press that
Broken Hill people could obtain service
by telephoning its representatives at
Cockburn. In this way, it looked like
being in business.
But it did not reckon on the ingenuity
of the BIC when it comes to a black
ban. The BIC tightened its grip by de-
claring that unionists were banned from
associating with Solomons in any way.
President of the all-powerful BIC, Mr
W. S. O’Neil, pointed out that this meant
that the home of any person found deal-
ing with Solomons would be blacklisted.
Anyone so involved would therefore find
that he would be deprived of sanitary,
milk, bread and other services. In fact,
no unionist would be permitted to visit
such a home. Within 48 hours Solomons
agreed to obey the rules and the BIC
lifted its ban.
Such is the rule of law on the Barrier.

This aluminium truck body leads a
rugged, exhausting life, carrying coal
for S. & M. Fox Pty. Limited. Now
on its third chassis, it’s showing no
sign of quitting.
S. & M. Fox have been using
Australuco aluminium on truck bodies
and underframes for eight years now.
Over 150 of their trucks have proved
that tough, light aluminium can with-
stand heavy loads and harsh abrasion.
The lightness of aluminium has meant
a reduction of more than 55 per cent
in body weight, resulting in an extra
12 cwt. of carrying capacity.
Of course, there's more to achieve-
ment than aluminium alone. Achieve-
ment also means Australuco’s years of
experience in research, testing, design,
metallurgical improvements . . . years
of practical application which can be
summed up in two words: know-how.
So, when you add technical skill and
expertise to aluminium's inherent
qualities (no rust or rot, no mainten-
ance, no painting, corrosion resis-
tance), achievement is the natural
result.
Australuco’s engineers and tech-
nicians, backed by the world-wide
experience and knowledge of the
Alcan Group, are able to supply the
latest information about the many
applications of aluminium with its
many versatile alloys in all phases of
Australian industry.

ON THE MARGIN
Lunchmanship
importance of lunch in big busi-
ness is now generally recognised.
A frank statement was made on the
matter by Edward A. Merkle, President
of the Madison Fund Inc., a New York
investment company. He was explaining
how American financial firms buy and
sell blocks of each other’s shares with-
out the aid of stockbrokers. “When
two institutions get together on a trade,
it is purely accidental,” Mr Merkle
said. “It all depends on who you have
lunch with.”
A man’s business prospects depend a
good deal, in fact, on his ability to hold
his own in the rough-and-tumble of
modern lunching. Nowhere is this
better realised than at the Young Exe-
cutives’ Training College in Melbourne,
which I visited lately.
When I called on Mr Peter Fangley,
the Principal, he was at his
desk looking over some
menus.
“We put strong emphasis
on lunch education here,” he
said. “There are two main
qualifications for a success-
ful lunchman. First, he
must be the kind of fellow
that people will ask to lunch.
It can be a fatal business handicap
to be a bore, or a noisy eater. Second,
the young executive must be able to
hold his food and drinks. You may
have noticed our motto —”
He gestured towards a framed in-
scription on the wall:
If you cun keep your head when
all about you
Are full of grog and forcing it on
you . . .
Mr Fangley then showed me round
the college. The first incident on the
tour was somewhat startling. A white-
faced young man staggered out of a
nearby room. Without saying a word,
he fell flat on his face in front of us.
/
Mr Fangley looked concerned. “I am
afraid Hopkinson is going to fail the
Martini course,” he said. “It's a pity,
because he is a very capable account-
ant.” White-coated stewards carried
the nrostrate pupil away.
“Let's look in on the Advanced Bon-
homie Class,” Mr Fangley said. “These
are men who have passed in basic lunch-
ing. but need a little polishing up.”
We went into a room where students
were seated around a table, smoking,
and drinking coffee and liqueurs. A
personable young man was talking.
“I don’t know if you've heard this
one,” he said.
“There was a young lady of Sydney
With a swimming pool shaped like
a kidney —”
The concluding lines of the limerick
raised a loud laugh. Nodding towards
the speaker, Mr Fangley remarked to
me: “McSharp is a natural lunchman.
You’ll be hearing more of him. Ali
Baba Holdings, the real estate develop-
ers, are grooming him for something
big.”
A pained-looking man came up to us
in the corridor. Mr Fangley gave him
a few quiet words of advice and he
went away.
“That’s Gutworth, one of our prob-
lem students,” Mr Fangley murmured.
“He’s outstandingly good with whisky,
but he seems allergic to oysters.”
Stewards bustled past carrying trays
of beef stroganoff and tripe a la mode de
Caen to the classrooms. I
was feeling hungry, and was
glad when Mr Fangley asked
me to stay to lunch.
Over whiting caprice and
riesling, I asked: “Do you
have any special difficulties
in your work here?”
“Well, yes. The chief one
is lunch resistance,” he re-
plied. “A surprising number of men
come to me and confess that they haven’t
the appetite for a full business lunch.
As junior employees they have developed
the grab-a-pie mentality.”
“I appeal to their sense of duty, re-
minding them that an executive eats
lunch for the firm, not for himself. I
advise them to have a light breakfast.
And I give an inspirational talk on
Bernard Weems.”
“Weems was one of our best students.
He became personal assistant to Sir
Henry Vast, head of Cosmic Industries.
Cosmic was making a takeover bid for
Viscous Plastics, and Sir Henry took
Bernard along to a lunch with the Vis-
cous people. It was a big do—-four
wines, crepes suzette, and so on. They
were still dickering over terms when old
Sir Henry suddenly keeled over with
stomach cramps.
“Do you know what young Weems
did? He ordered another round of
double brandies and carried on the
negotiations himself. What's more, he
swung a very favorable share-exchange
deal. That’s the value of lunch fitness.”
I came away from the college with
new confidence in this country's mana-
gerial talent. Our representatives, I
believe, can eat with the best of them.

Is Boxing Necessary?
In the days of judo , karate and the knife
By DISCUS
Any month now it is possible that
Australia could have a boxing
commission. It is possible, but
doubtful. Such a commission should
be established to control the sport,
license all of its participants, and see
that both the boxers and promoters re-
ceive fair treatment from one another.
It should, logically, be headed by some-
one independent of the professional
sport. The proposal, now current, is for
a commission headed by the chairman
of directors of Stadiurps Ltd, which con-
trols at least 90 per cent of all profes-
sional boxing promotion in Australia.
The first news of the proposed com-
mission was related to the fact that most
other countries have such organisations,
and the suggestion that lack of one was
preventing the engagement of Sandro
Mazzinghi and Emile Griffith to fight
here. Both have fought in Sydney for
Stadiums Ltd. but there was no explana-
tion as to why they might be unwilling
to return. It could not be said that the
Italian organisation or any of the three
US controlling bodies would stop them
coming here for a match, or possibly
deny the winner the right to call him-
self junior middleweight champion of the
world. The US organisations often have
up to three different champions in any
weight division.
However, granting that lack of a
commission might in some way prevent
the engagement of overseas fighters, it
is possibly more important to consider
what it might do, or not do, for Aus-
tralian boxing and boxers. This was
not mentioned in the proposal. It is
rather important. And it is important
that the commissioner should be able
to act as an independent arbiter in any
collision of interests, at home as well as
abroad. In many of the countries which
have commissions it is the custom to
appoint a retired military man, or pre-
ferably, if one is available, a top
amateur.
Over the years, there have been many
moves for a commission, but State
rights to a limited control over boxing
is one deterrent. The other is that
while a commission is under considera-
tion boxing goes into one of its periodic
declines and the questions seem hardly
worth the bother. How badly is a con-
troller needed for a sport which is barely
in existence; whose only man of any
considerable merit is Rocky Gattellari,
who was going to have a fight a month
from last October and has not had one
since?
The question is not whether a com-
mission is needed, but whether the pub-
lic finds boxing necessary at all?
That could have been answered with
a rousing affirmative before 1939. For
40 years before then boxing had been
one of the major sports, both in its pro-
fessional and, after the 1904 Olympic
Games inclusion, its amateur forms. It
was an accepted part of the British,
American and Australian ways of life
that all fighting should be done with the
fists. It was unthinkable that an honor-
able boy or man would adopt any other
fighting pose. And the world cham-
pions, particularly the heavyweights,
were heroes all over the English-speak-
ing world.
Four things changed that drastically.
The “wrong” people began to hold most
of the world titles. Worse, during the
war tens of thousands of English-
speaking men were taught that fists
were the last things to use. Troops were
trained to maim and kill, quickly and
silently, using all the clean and dirty
tricks of an unarmed combat procedure
developed from judo, karate, wrestling,
savate and knife-fighting.
The generations after the war have
had a very different outlook to those
before it. It is still occasionally a sur-
prise to parents to find their sons’ idea of
sport is mostly wrapped around a car
and a transistor radio, and that to settle
differences in and out of school is to
fight a kind of commando rules, far re-
moved from Queensberry. Young men
show a great lack of interest in boxing,
look at it coldly as a limited method of
combat, even a slightly ridiculous one.
And television has affected boxing at-
tendances. In the USA it decimated the
crowds who used to go to district ath-
letic clubs where' the beginners and
veterans could both manage a living.
Much the same has happened in Britain.
In Australia it may be happening now
in the country centres where the small
promoters are beginning to feel tele-
vision’s effect, but in particular it has
prevented the growth and spread of
promotion which could have occurred
with increasing population. Nor is it
any help to boxing that few of the
heroes of television seem to have heard
of Queensberry rules, either.
Add to all these things the disenchant-
ments of boxing in post-war America,
the rise of new popular sports offering


benefits in money or fame, the publicity
which ring deaths and injuries receive
when they occur, and you have further
reasons for the public’s rejection of
boxing, which is clearly shown when a
fighter of Gattellari’s calibre cannot fill
Sydney Stadium, and when 300 turn up
to see a bout for the middleweight cham-
pionship of Australia.
The amateur side of boxing is no
healthier. It should be, with better
facilities for boys to learn and train at
all the Police Boys’ Clubs, RSL Youth
Clubs and church - sponsored youth
centres which have come into existence
in recent years. But again public
opinion of boxing as a suitable sport or
a necessary means of self-defence is re-
flected in the numbers of boys who
prefer judo, wrestling, table tennis or
draughts to boxing. Their distaste for it
is supported by parents and by many of
the physical instructors. Even those
who favor boxing are seldom capable of
teaching more than its rudiments, and
in its rudimentary form the craft is not
very interesting.
The amateur rules, as interpreted
now, are sriiall help in this. Points are
awarded mainly for straight attacking
blows. Hooking is out. The “noble art
of self-defence” no longer gives much
credit for skill in defence. A reincarna-
ted Young Griffo would be lucky to win
any four-round amateur contest. A
Maxie Rosenbloom would not be in the
event. Why bother much with defence
when it scores no points for you, but
only negatively might reduce the points
scored against you?
This is a poor and dangerous situa-
tion. The amateurs are just the ones
who should be taught a thorough de-
fence before being taught to attack, and
to co-ordinate the two. The neglect of
such basic training can be seen, -some-
times almost tragically, in the fighting
ability of amateurs who turn professional
in Australia. A classic recent instance
was Sid Prior, a wonderful attacking
fighter, a man who trained to perfection,
but a boxer whose only real defence
was attack. And in boxing, despite the
adage, this is not the best means of
offence, but merely the quickest way to
get a permanent headache. Unfor-
tunately it is usually impossible for a
boxer to go back, and learn the basics
properly, once he is on the road to
success.
Even the perfect boxer can be hit, and
harmed. How much more dangerous is
the sport to the very imperfect boxer?
Doctors are clear on that. There are
always grave risks of injury to the brain,
and more so to the optic nerve, less so to
the kidneys and liver. However, box-
ing's much - publicised fatalities are
fewer than those in such sports as motor
racing, horse racing, speedway, football
and mountaineering. Outside America,
where the sport is licensed mayhem,
football has most of its deaths in minor
games, with ill-prepared untrained play-
ers who should never have taken the
field. It is quite possible that football
also injures more people than boxing.
But if these two sports are in com-
parison, football is a team sport with
its dullest moments shining bright as
against the boxing skills, or painful lack
of them, on display these days. Foot-
ball flourishes, players and spectators
flock to it, the clubs are wealthy. Box-
ing is moribund, seems on its last legs.
It lacks the spirit to prove that it is a
necessary sport to the paying public,
Its administrators are either men who
have thrown in the towel, or men who
don’t know what ails them, certainly
don’t know what to do about it, and do
not appear to want to know. This atti-
tude is seen at the end of civilisations,
and at the death of sports.
The Promoters
T>oxing is a 20th-century sport. It has
not been with us long. It evolved
from bare-knuckle fighting under the
misapprehension that padded gloves
would make the contests less damaging
and more humane. Bare-knuckle fight-
ing was illegal in most parts of the
world during the 200 years it flourished.
Boxing has been legal in most parts of
the world since the turn of the century.
Without gloves it was a bloody and
dangerous sport, but limited by the
amount of punishment a man’s knuckles
could take, as well as deal out.
With gloves that handicap was re-
moved; the sport became legal and popu-
lar, and thousands of men of all ages
have battered one another in the ring
which had become a roped square, and
who knows how much damage that fact
alone has caused. Using the ropes is
part of the craft. A blow from a man
coming off the ropes has added force.
So has one delivered to him. Almost
everything our well - meaning ancestors
did to make fist fighting humane has
been exactly the opposite in effect.
No one would suggest that the sport
should return to its origins. It began
as a gentleman’s sport. Promoters gave
it to the crowd. Now that the crowd
sees little in it, a new fancy may have
to take it up again. It could survive
that way.
The promoters show no signs of doing
anything more than trying to work the
same old ground, like farmers who re-
fuse modern ideas. They are satisfied to
echo such catch-cries as “bad times
make good fighters”. Good fighters in
the past may have been uneducated men
but they have seldom been unintelligent.
Now I suggest the men who could be-
come good boxers are not willing to put
up with the conditions of the sport, and
this is something which a strong inde-
pendent commission might revise. There
is good money to be made in profes-
sional boxing, but the dire need of “bad
times” no longer exists.
Those days are probably gone forever.
Just as probably the future will have
times when larger populations with more
leisure will look for more sport, and
more sports. If boxing is to be one of
them it will need drastic changes, from
the grassroots up. At present there is
no sign that it, or the people interested
in it, have made any plans along that
line.
Boxing no more necessary to the
people of 1965 than athletics, swimming,
tennis, cricket or football. That is to
say, it is a sport which requires an
extremely high degree of fitness and
skill, and dedication, if you are going
to be any good at it, amateur or pro-
fessional. But the rewards for that need
to be in more than cash. Stature and
dignity are as important. Otherwise an
athlete will chose other sports which
offer cash and stature at the same time.
The public does not need boxing as
it now exists. But I believe, and 1 am
not alone in the notion, that it could be
an excellent sport among others which
might help to keep the nation fit, with
all its reflexes functioning.
However any lasting revival of interest
in the sport will not be brought about by
wishing, and it will take more than one
man, more than Rocky Gattellari. Per-
haps first it would need a more general
acceptance among sports doctors and
physical instructors as a sport preferable
to many others which are insufficiently
active to offset heavy eating and heavy
sitting among the young. It would also
need a revised outlook and rules in the
amateurs to make defence as important
as offence and the two in combination
most important of all. This would mean
a lot of basic training for its instructors.
And those who wanted to succeed in
amateur boxing might have to train as
hard as swimmers.
This could all be achieved, giving the
sport more status and attracting more
men of Tony Madigan's stature to it.
And this small movement alone would
cause enough ripples in the professional
game to improve the public view of it
somewhat. Then it would be time to
create a boxing commission which could
ensure that justice was done to a sport
which has declined from major stature
to minimal importance in a very few
years.
Otherwise, the gloves are already on
the proverbial nail on the wall. Most
of the people in Brisbane, Sydney and
Melbourne live far from the established
stadiums. Night racing may take boxing
as an “added attraction”, as the Inter-
Dominion promoters are doing in New

The Yoga Boom
More than a spiritual 5BX?
By HUGH CURNOW
Some two dozen women in black leo-
tards are stretched flat on their
backs on pale green foam-rubber
mats. They appear asleep and none is
moving any of her muscles from the
neck down, though several are flexing
their mouths, fish-like, with each breath.
A few men in swim trunks are sprinkled
among them, each on his separate mat.
One is young and bearded and obviously
in excellent nick. Another is old, marble-
white and incredibly thin. Two small
boys, with legs spread-eagled and arms
folded behind their heads, are imitating
their mothers’ immobility. One. man is
seated alone on a raised platform at
the end of the room facing everyone's
feet. Like the others he is motionless.
Clad only in a pair of black briefs, he
has the sleek, brown body of a young
swimmer and a face which, in repose,
appears to be approaching middle-age.
He is one man who never frowns.
There is no trace of any line or crease-
mark between his brows and apparently
there never has been. Now he is squat-
ting. cross-legged, with wrists on knees
and eyelids lowered; V-pointed finger-
nails of each thumb and forefinger
lightly touch, forming two silent Os
above a cigar-slim microphone lain on
the floor in front of his horizontal
ankles.
This is 54-year-old Michael Volin
and this is one of his yoga classes in
the auditorium of the Ironworkers’
Building next door to a Chinese restaur-
ant in George Street, Sydney. A shouted
night-order for two abelones and prawn
omelettes ascends through open windows
along with the revving of a passing bus
and hum of a speeding train beneath the
near-at-hand Cahill Expressway, but all
inside the auditorium is silence. Now
Mr Volin lilts the microphone to his
lips and speaks softly into it. “Imagine”,
he says, “that with each even, rhythmi-
cal breath you are inhaling Prana—what
we call the Life Force —so that you are
literally hurling life into your body.
Roll your mind over your body and
empty its nervous channels. Rid your-
self of each tension area that has built
up during the day. Relax, from the tips
of your toes up: legs, abdominal muscles,
chest, shoulders, arms, hands and finally
facial muscles.” There is another long
silence, then the gentle voice continues:
“Now, imagine that you are in a beauti-
ful garden one thousand miles aw'ay.
Concentrate on that single thought and
soon you will be there rested and tran-
quil in that lovely garden.” More
silence, followed by an instruction to
take a deep breath, stretch, yawn and sit
up. With all torsoes perpendicular, Mr
Volin makes a small obeisance to his
pupils by inclining his forehead with
his hands pressed together in prayer
attitude in front of it and the physical
exercises begin.
What follows is something more than
what at first it seems to be: a sort of
quasi-spiritual SBX. Certainly a yoga
exercise is a form of physical culture
and it does have mental and spiritual
aspects; but these are intrinsic rather
than codicillary. However, whether the
recently-estimated 3000 Sydney yogis
now hard at it (90 per cent of them are
women) are aware of, or want, the
depths of yoga’s claimed mental bene-
fits is impossible for me to say. My
guess, after observing a hundred or so
in classes and speaking to some of them,
is that they are.
It is plain where Eastern-style yoga
differs from the more familiar Western-
style dictums of Charles Atlas, Silhou-
ette and School PT. Yoga exercises are
performed only once or twice at each
hour-long session and there is no such
business as a repetitive series of push-
ups. Then there is the design of the
sequence of exercises. The whole hour
is choreographed like a ballet each par-
ticipant may perform and adapt. One
exercise flows easily into another which,
in turn, readily becomes another and so
on until there is a pause that refreshes
mind and body. Deep breathing helps
the one; concentration on a mild form
of self-hypnosis assists the other.
This self-hypnosis is comparatively
simple to perform. According to Mr
Volin all that is necessary is to think of
nothing.
As with all other yoga exercises, I
am told, practice helps make perfect.
And I can well believe it. One Sydney
housewife arid mother told me that she
could manage to make her mind blank
each morning before breakfast, some-
times for half an hour. She said her
husband had no objections as this had
resulted in her becoming “a much nicer
person to live with” already.
A Sydney psychiatrist who attends
regular yoga classes in Sydney said it
has taken him a year to attain the group
of yogis who have succeeded in making
the journey inside themselves. “It is
much further to travel inside your own
mind than from here to the moon,” he
told me quietly.
Already scores of yoga classes,
ranging from fully-equipped studios to
converted spare rooms in private homes,
have been set up in Sydney and its
suburbs. Melbourne yogis are equally
widespread. Enthusiasts of all ages pay
between 7s. 6d. and 10s. an hour for a
series of four to ten lessons. Mostly
Hatha Yoga is taught. According to
the experts there are some eight aspects
of this basis yoga: body poses, breath
control, mind-withdrawal, concentration,
contemplation, observance,- abstinence,
identification. The last-mentioned is the
main aim of good yogis; in “identifica-
tion” they claim the entire self dissolves
into “all and everything”. Traditionally
HA is the right nostril's breathing, THA
is the left nostril's and YOGA is a
union of both flows of breath. One
matron who drives to town from Double
Bay each Thursday evening for her
hourly class said she could hold her
breath for the full length of William
Street, including one red light!
A young mother who attends subur-
ban yoga classes at the North Ryde
kindergarten enjoys standing on her
head. She said she took up yoga partly
to master that and partly to learn mind
control. The majority of yoga enthusi-
asts praise its mental benefits. A 30-
year-old man who said he works in a
city store during the day spends 225. 6d.
on three yoga sessions each week to
“remain calm”. He also practises some
of yoga’s health dictums, such as
scraping clean the tongue first thing in
the morning before swallowing any
liquid, and having regular enemas. “I
used to do the SBX. It's good for keep-
ing fit but it doesn't do a thing for you
inside ,” he told me. One woman in her
sixties who has been doing, yoga for
eight years in Sydney says she still
can't stand on her head. "But it doesn’t
matter. I love feeling ten years younger
just sitting up the right way,” she said.
Books by the half-dozen are available
on the practice of yoga and have been
published within the last four years.


Two more are due on the bookstands
next month. Most of the books fit into
the category of “Do-It-Yourself” litera-
ture, complete with pictures or illustra-
tions. One of the most explicit, “The
Essence of Yoga”, by Michael Volin and
Nancy Phelan, continually emphasises
the mental possibilities of the exercises.
But one popular instructor at Hurst-
ville, 52-year-old Mr Don Bilton, pre-
fers to leave any of the spiritual side
of yoga to his pupils to research for
themselves.
“I don’t go along with expounding
the so-called religious role of yoga in my
classes. We have hundreds of women
and a few men who attend regularly.
It is really just a matter of teaching
them the exercise routines,” he says. Yet
away from his air-conditioned studio
Mr Bilton is a firm believer in the so-
called “immunity” aspects of yoga and
has refused to have his three children
(aged 19, 16 and 13) immunised against
any disease. “Yoga cured me of a
form of TB from which my brother
died. My children have done all their
exercises and have never needed medical
attention,” he told me. I asked him if
he really believed that yoga could pre-
vent his children contracting tetanus,
diphtheria or whooping cough when
they were very young.
“And why shouldn’t I?” he replied
blandly.
Yogis like Mr Volin (who has spent
the past 15 years in Sydney and the 15
before that in Shanghai) are quite firm
about the futility of that sort of thing.
“Yoga is not a substitute for the dis-
coveries of medical science,” he told
me wearily at the end of an evening
class. “Of course a good yogi gets his
smallpox jabs like anyone else. So he
should!” And, raising his unlined brows
slightly to take the weight off his eyes,
he added finally: “The trouble with this
boom in yoga in Australia is that you
get some people going after the shape
instead of the substance.”
AROUND MELBOURNE
Gin and Chicken on HD Day
Inverse public relations
Tn our last episode, you may remember,
A we were talking about the motor
show, and I rambled on without one
mention of the new Holden. The show
opened on the Thursday but the new
Holden was not released until the follow-
ing Monday. This meant that the new
models had to be slipped into the
Exhibition Building on the fourth day of
the show.
The naive would say: “Surely GM-H,
with a little extra effort, could have pro-
duced their cars for the first day of the
show. Or, surely, GM-H with all their
push could have made the organisers
open the show any damned day they
wished.” This, of course, is to overlook
a small triumph in public relations. Put
your car in on the opening day and
you're competing with all the other flash,
brand-new exhibits (there were at least
11 including the Mercedes 600), but
wait for four days and you craftily build
up interest. You have the motoring
writers and the front pages all to your-
self.
GM-H works on a highly organised
system of inverse public relations, which
pays large dividends. Everyone knows,
roughly, when the new Holden will be
exposed to the air. But GM-H carries
on as if already they have reached their
brilliant zenith and never there will be
another. HD Day was February 16, but
the invitations didn’t go out until a few
days beforehand and even the motoring
writers were asked not to reveal what
was afoot.
But on HD Day all was well. There
was chicken and gin, there were delect-
able models (female) on top to be photo-
graphed beside the new HDs and cars
available to all for test drives. A GM-H
executive explained all: “It was wonder-
ful. Nobody cracked, nobody at GM-H
gave the news out beforehand. In fact
in all the years I don’t think anybody
ever has. I admit there have been a
number of occasions when various news-
papers and magazines have cracked it
by various ruses. But I don’t think they
have ever got the information wittingly
from a GM-H employee. Actually we
don’t get upset when they do honestly
crack it. Look at the publicity we get.
It's far better this way. They put their
hot picture of their new Holden all over
the front page. If you took the photo-
graph to their office and asked them to
print it you’d be lucky to make page
17.”
The best performance, our man re-
ported, was back in the days of the FB
Holden. A motoring writer dressed up
as an electrician, blue overalls, tool kit,
and walked unchallenged into the GM-H
factory. He walked up and down the
assembly line and photographed the lot.
Not until the motoring writer admitted
later what he had done did they find
out how he did it. This was tried again
recently at Pagewood. The disguised
writer had his camera in a lunch box.
The trouble was he photographed the
wrong car, the new Vauxhall, and he
had to go back again.
Naturally enough, the keenest sleuth-
ing has taken place at the GM-H proving
ground at Lang Lang. Here motoring
writers have dared all, climbed trees,
mounted ladders, burrowed under fences.
The favorite story concerns a recent
venture of a motoring editor. Along
with photographer he wriggled his way
into Lang Lang and hid under a bush.
Along came a Holden, it stopped, the
driver got out and, one regrets to report,
walked over and relieved himself on the
very bush that contained the motoring
editor.
Motoring editors can endure only so
much for their publications. He fled,
but by this time he had lost the photo-
grapher and Lang Lang is a very large
place, over 2000 acres. He walked four
miles to the nearest telephone and called
his solicitor, asking him to come quick.
The motoring man wanted to make sure
of his legal position after being nabbed
for trespassing. The solicitor came out
and it was very late that night before
the editor returned home.
Then there was the motoring writer
from Sydney. He got to talking .to
GM-H in a local pub, and the GM-H
man began to shoot a line: “You had
better look out, mate. Lang Lang is
guarded by barbed wire and fierce
alsatian dogs.” This appeared in a
Sydney evening paper and it was duly
reported back to Melbourne. Next up,
a dog inspector called on Mr Jack Joyce
of the proving ground at Lang Lang.
“Have you got licences for all these
alsatians?” said he. Mr Joyce explained
it was all a joke. There were no alsa-
tians. Just then his pet poodle trotted
into the room. “How about that one
then?” said the inspector. “All right,
you’ve got me,” said Joyce.
Then there's the other angle to the
GM-H inverse PR. Other cars have
lovely euphonious names like Lauren-
tian. Parisienne and Cutlass. GM-H
have stuck strictly to code numbers FJ
and EK. This, too, was supposed to be
top secret. The idea was that GM-H had
4000 sub-contractors and when they
ordered parts for an FJ or EK the sub-
contractor didn't know when the model
would be released, but if he cracked the
code he knew all. When the EJ Holden
w'as released “The Sun-News Pictorial”
was unkind enough to reveal the code.
It went like this:
ABCDEFGHJK
0987654 321
By fitting the numerals to the letters
you read off the code, FJ for 52, EK
for 61, EJ for 62.
Because of this code-cracking GM-H
has changed the system. The 65 Holden
should be EF, but it is the HD. I have
tossed restlessly through the night trying
to crack this code, but until GM-H
produce yet another model, this is ex-
tremely difficult.

OVERSEAS
The New Conquest of
South India?
Three weeks that undermined the Union
From MONICA FELTON in Madras
(Author of “I Meet Rajaji”)
urTTHEY killed Kairon. Why not the
same for Bhaktavatsalam?”
This isn’t a scrap of overheard
conversation. Incitement to murder the
Chief Minister of the State is chalked
on the pavement in front of Madras
city’s most centrally-situated hotel. A
few yards farther on someone has
written a scrap of verse:
The people are weeping
The Ministers are sleeping.
Oh what for a post?
Next to this are several slogans
written in Tamil script. Then, again in
English, “Police imperialism also must
have a downfall. Thus paving the way
for Victory Churchill’s Keyword.”
Shops, factories and offices are closed.
No buses are running, and no taxis are
on the streets. Hooligans have smashed
up railway stations and burned two
coaches of the incoming Calcutta Mail.
Now all train services have been can-
celled. This is Black Friday, February
12, and South India is observing a
hartal, a day of mourning for the men
and boys who have been killed since
January 25, the eve of the day when
Hindi became the official language of
the Union of India.
Along Mount Road, Madras city’s
main thoroughfare, people stroll past
the closed shutters of sari shops and
jewellers and antique dealers, stopping
now and then to scan hand-written
posters, black on white:
628 STUDENTS YESTERDAY.
Arrested? Beaten up? Wounded?
Killed? Surely not as many as that?
Nobody knows. The official death-roll
to date, according to the newspapers, is
30. But eye-witness accounts, confirmed
from more than one source, suggest that
this is an under-estimate.
The suburban roads are empty, the
silence almost as palpable as on the day
when Mr Nehru died. Today it doesn’t
last. Suddenly, it seems out of no-
where, a small crowd gathers in front
of the post office on the corner. Win-
dows are smashed. The name-board
over the entrance is torn down. Some-
one has a can of petrol, and in a minute
or two this small part of the property of
the Government of India is in flames.
By the time the police arrive, the
crowd has already dispersed. The police
van dashes down the lane past my house.
The Harijans who live in the palm-
thatched huts at the bottom of the lane
are supporters of the Tamil National
Party, whose leader now supports the
Congress. So they are safe. They stand
around, not worried for themselves but
still a bit scared, as the police jump down
in front of the second row of huts. Here,
every family supports the DMK (the
extremist anti-Hindi Dravida Munnetra
Kazegham), and the substantially-built
house a little farther on is occupied by
a member of the City Council who is
also a member of the DMK, the majority
party.
Men and boys start running. The
police, lathis in their hands, run faster.
While the city councillor is being pulled
out of his house and pushed into the van,
a thirteen - year - old boy is seized,
savagely beaten and flung in, too. No-
body escapes. The women are left watch-
ing, some weeping, some dry-eyed, as
their husbands and sons are driven away.
These incidents are trivial compared
with what is going on elsewhere. The
Army, called in on Wednesday to help
quell the disorders, opened fire at
Pollachi, the home town of Mr C. Sub-
ramaniam, whose resignation as Union
Minister of Food and Agriculture was
announced on Wednesday. Ten people,
including a four-year-old child, have
been killed by light machine-gun fire and
police bullets. Mobs are running wild in
the historic fort-city of Trichinopolv, in
the former French colony of Pondi-
cherry, and in towns and villages which,
until,a fortnight or so ago, were happy
to be without a history.
How could all this have happened?
The Tamils have the reputation of being
the mildest of mild Hindus, pacific
almost to the point of apathy. Last
autumn, when starvation threatened,
thousands of men and women stood day
after day, often for six or seven hours
at a time, queuing in the broiling sun in
the hope of getting enough rice to feed
their families for a day or two. Often
they went away with their shopping-bags
still empty. Anywhere else in the world,
foreign commentators remarked, blood
would have been shed. Not here. There
were a few minor incidents, but nothing
that could be called a riot. Similarly,
student strikes, which break out in other
parts of India if fees are raised or an
examination paper looks a bit difficult,
are hardly known in the colleges affili-
ated to Madras University.
Madrasis, it had seemed, were dif-
ferent.
“This is the first time,” a student
leader declared when the present agita-
tion began, “that we’ve had a chance to
fight for a principle and not just for
ourselves, but for the sake pf the future
for the generations who will come
after us.”
South Indians have never forgotten
that the decision of the Constituent
Assembly to make Hindi the official
language of the Union of India was


m

If
arrived at only by the casting vote of
the chairman, the late Dr Rajendra
Prasad. The concession, embodied in
legislation in 1963, that English should
be allowed to continue as an “associate”
language, satisfied few people, even
though many accepted at its face-value
Mr Nehru’s promise that Hindi would
not be thrust on the non-Hindi-speaking
peoples and that English would be used
until they were willing to accept Hindi.
Events in the past few months had
already, before Republic Day, sub-
stantially devalued this undertaking.
Hindi fanatics in the North became in-
creasingly aggressive. Last August, 28
members of the Uttar Pradesh legis-
lature, after beating their desks with
shoes and sandals and screaming Hindi
slogans, were suspended for disorderly
conduct during the passage of a bill to
allow the limited use of English for
certain official purposes. In September,
a board in front of the RTO's office at
Lucknow railway station commanded,
SPEAK IN HINDI, and the official
behind the counter was authorised to
refuse to answer the questions of soldiers
who could not.
Next, the Press announced that direc-
tives had been issued by the Home
Ministry stating that after January 26
communications with Hindi - speaking
States should be in Hindi. The order
added that, in the meantime, “it would
be desirable to introduce a few printed
forms in Hindi so as to produce the
right psychological atmosphere”.
“So,” commented Mr C. Rajago-
palachari (Rajaji), the last surviving
leader of India's independence struggle
and at 86 the leader of the Swatantra
Party, “the conquest and the squeeze-
out have begun. The scheme auto-
matically displaces non-Hindi-knowing
officers in the Central Secretariat or
reduces them to a subordinate class. It
is a deplorable preparation for a split
of Bharat (India) into two parts.”
Now, too late for a denial to mollify
South Indian anger, Home Minister Mr
G. Nanda has just declared that the
circular, though drafted, was never
issued.
Far more inflammatory was last
month’s statement that the next examina-
tions conducted by the Union Public-
Services Commission would be held in
Hindi as well as English. In job-hungry
India the public services offer enviable
security and prestige. In the past
southerners have, year after year, won
a very high proportion of available posts.
To northerners, the prospect of being
allowed to answer questions in Hindi
seemed to offer a chance of levelling-up
the balance against sharp-witted Mad-
rasis. To southerners, it meant giving an
unfair advantage to competitors who
would be writing in their mother-tongue
as against candidates who, whether they
opted to answer in English or Hindi,
would be using a foreign language.
Mr Nanda has now declared that the
Minister who made this announcement
had got his facts wrong. Whether this
is so or not, fears for their own future
certainly played a big part in sparking
off the students’ demonstrations.
Day of Mourning
tTTiere were other factors. South
Indians have never accepted Prime
Minister Shastri’s view that to retain
English for all time as India’s official
language would be “a deeply humiliating
proposition”. Hindi, they concede, may
provide a useful lingua franca, but it is
far too undeveloped to become, in any
foreseeable future, a reliable medium
for public administration. There is,
besides, a deeply felt, if not altogether
justified, conviction that Hindi can only
spread at the cost of some sacrifice on
the part of other regional languages—
and at the cost of increasing domination
of the north over the south, not only in
public administration, but in all fields.
This is the view shared by Swatantrists
in the south and the Dravida Munnetra
Kazagham, the Congress Party’s most
formidable rival in Madras State.
It was the DMK which decided to
make Republic Day an occasion of
mourning. This, according to the party
leader, Mr C. N. Annadurai, did not
imply any disrespect towards the Indian
Republic. The decision, he added, had
been taken solely because January 26
was the date on which Hindi was to
become India’s official language.
Mr Annadurai, the mayor of Madras,
and most of the other DMK leaders were
whisked off to gaol before the first
student demonstrations took place on
January 25. Though the DMK certainly
has a big following among students,
most of the demonstrators seem to have
been boys without any party attach-
ments. Reports are unanimous that the
demonstrations began peacefully and
would have remained peaceful if the
students had not been stung into violence
by agents provocateurs.
The first incident, which took place
in the ancient temple city of Madurai,
was sparked off by a group of men,
armed with knives and sticks, who
attacked a procession as it marched past
the district Congress Party office. The
warden of a Madras college hostel says
that trouble started there when a Con-
gress worker threw a soda-water bottle
at students who were putting up black
flags on the hostel premises The prin-
cipal of another college, where the police
broke in and tear-gassed students in
their rooms, denied that the boys had
been fighting among themselves. Only
an inquiry, he said, would reveal whether
his students had, as the police alleged,
burned a bus, or whether “antisocial
elements” were responsible. Similar
statements from many other places leave
no doubt that during the first phase of
the agitation much of the violence was
deliberately provoked.
High schools and colleges were closed
by Government order and public meet-
ings banned. Even so, there was no mis-
taking the rising tide of public feeling.
By the end of the first week of February
it was evident that the Government
would be compelled to make conces-
sions. On February 9 Mr Annadurai
appealed to students to suspend their
agitation. Rajaji, making a similar
appeal, pledged, “If the Government
does nothing and the agitation has to be
renewed, I will come out and lead you”.
The students were divided. One
group decided to take this advice. The

Artists in a trading company?
Why not? C. Itoh not only sells and buys, but re-designs pro-
ducts to meet the specialized needs of an increasingly com-
plex world market. One of Japan’s oldest and largest interna-
tional trading companies, C. Itoh needs artists and designers ■
as well as traders, technicians and engineers. C. Itoh fashion
specialists, for example, are among the men who created the
fresh new designs on Japanese textiles that have made it
possible for this industry to export in 1964 more than 35% of
its entire production.
Whether you want to buy or sell from Japan or in any one
of the other 50 countries throughout the world where C. Itoh
branches or affiliates are established or the 100 countries in
which C. Itoh trades, it might be a good idea to get in touch
with an experienced C. Itoh man first. He’s probably solved
your trading problem even before you’ve quite found out

other suspended their activities only

Meanwhile, anti-social elements, as
they are called, were taking over. Mr
Bhaktavatsalam, the Chief Minister,
says he has evidence that the DMK, and
the leftist Communists and certain mill-
owners who want to embarrass the Gov-
ernment are responsible for the destruc-
tion which has taken place since Febru-
ary 9.
Whatever part these may have played,
there is no doubt that the cause goes
deeper. Rajaji is aimost certainly right
in saying that the economic situation is
responsible. People in almost every
section of society—though, of course,
this isn’t only true of the south—-have
suffered too much tor too long. The rich
complain of disincentives to enterprise
caused by heavy taxation, slow-moving
bureaucratic controls and widespread
corruption in official circles. The middle
classes complain at the fever-chart leaps
in the cost of living, shortage of jobs and
paucity of educational opportunities for
their children. And the poor, with
reason, complain about everything.
Adding all this to the southerners
traditional and deep-seated fear of north-
ern domination, nobody should really
be surprised that the language issue
should have turned out to be the last
straw. As I write this, things are simmer-
ing down. Mr Bhaktavatsalam, whose
name means Affectionate Love, has
agreed to take up with the Centre the
question of securing permanent bi-
lingualism by statute. But the joint use,
for official purposes, of Hindi and
English isn’t likely to satisfv the south
It is bound to lead to confusion and to
more delays in an administrative machine
which is already intolerably slow On
the other hand, it is equally certain that
the people representing the Hindi-speak-
ing States will never agree to the re-
tention of English as the only official
language of the Union.
So there is no happy ending. Indeed,
at the moment it is impossible to guess
when things will end, or how. Mr
Shastri’s broadcast assurances that his
Government stands by Mr Nehru’s
pledges has satisfied nobody in the south,
least of all the students, the men who
teach them and other intellectuals. The
only statement in his talk with which
they all agree is that “what is involved
is the very unity of the country”. Cer-
tainly the last three weeks have wiped
out India’s one gain from the Chinese
aggression of 1962—real national unity.
Whether the conference of Chief
Ministers of the Indian States, which is
to meet in Delhi on February 23 and
24, will be able to retrieve this loss is
anybody’s guess. At the moment, it
seems unlikely.

YALTA
20 Years After
By EMERY BARCS
TI/lachiavelli would have greatly en-
joyed Stalin’s use of the bellissimo
inganno, the beautiful cheat, at the Yalta
conference which had its melancholic
20th anniversary this month. During
his discussions with President Roosevelt
and Prime Minister Churchill he made
practically no mistake.
Before going'to the eight-day confer-
ence which opened on February 4, 1945,
Roosevelt told his confidants that if he
gave Stalin everything the dictator
wanted and asked nothing in return,
then Stalin would attempt no annexa-
tions but would work with the President
in creating a peaceful world. And this
was exactly what in Yalta Stalin prom-
ised to do. “All of us,” he declared,
“want to secure peace for at least 50
years.”
Returning from the conference Roose-
velt sent a message to the US Congress
on March 1, expressing his firm belief
that the meeting in the Crimea made
an important first step towards a peaceful
world because the Allies had decided
to remain united not only in their war
aims but also in their peace aims. And
two days before, on February 27, Mr
Churchill told the Commons: “The im-
pression I brought back from the Crimea,
and from all my other contacts, is that
Marshal Stalin and the other Soviet
leaders wish to live in honorable part-
nership and equality with the Western
democracies. I feel also, that their word
is their bond.”
Roosevelt did not live to see the dis-
appointing aftermath of Yalta, for he
died two months after the conference.
He was gravely ill at the time of the
meeting and his physical weakness must

ces were tragic as 100 million

have impaired, if not his lucidity then
at least his mental elasticity. This may
be an explanation for his readiness to
say yes and amen to most of Stalin’s
proposals. But how was it possible that
Churcbill had allowed Stalin to fool
him? Only about a year after Yalta—
when some prominent politicians still
hoped against hope in Russian co-opera-
tion—Churchill denounced Stalin’s policy
in Eastern Europe in a famous speech
at Fulton, Missouri. He knew more
about Communists than most of his
fellow-politicians. Why didn’t he put
up a braver fight?
There are several explanations. In
February, 1945, World War II was ob-
viously close to its end in Europe. The
situation did not seem to be so strikingly
favorable in the Pacific. Although the
news of the recapture of Manila arrived
in Yalta on the second day of the con-
ference and other good news —including
the fast advance of Chiang Kai-shek’s
forces in Manchuria and of Lord Mount-
batten’s troops in Northern Burma—con-
tinued to pour in, the American military
experts believed that the Japanese could
continue the war for another 18 months.
After five-and-a-half years of war the
overwhelming desire in the West was to
defeat Germany and Japan as fast as
possible and to make peace. The re-
occupation of Poland had revealed for
the first time the horrible stories about
the Nazi’s industrialisation of death and
other outrages. No punishment was held
to be savage enough for the “German
nation of monsters”. On the other hand
Western propaganda did its utmost to
glorify the heroism and military prowess
of the suffering Soviet peoples. (Soviet
propaganda kept the West’s role in the
war to a microscopic minimum.) Stalin
was “our Uncle Joe”.
The Yalta conference was called to-
gether to put the final touches to the
broad agreements on the fate of Germany
and of German-occupied Europe which
the Big Three reached in Teheran
(November 28-December 1, 1943) and
at other minor conferences. Another
purpose of the meeting was to persuade
Stalin to enter the war against Japan
after the cessation of hostilities in
Europe.
Eastern Europe was the area that
really mattered to Stalin and the region
which he had most carefully planned
to take over. When he promised
“democracy” to Poland, Czechoslovakia,
Hungary, Rumania, Yugoslavia and
Bulgaria he meant Communism. Roose-
velt thought of a system based on the
US Congress and Churchill probably had
in mind the Mother of Parliaments.
The stiff price Stalin demanded for
the Soviet’s entry into the war in the
Far East was Western recognition of
Russia’s right to take over Japan’s lead-
ing role in that area through territorial
gains and assurances of special interests
in certain spheres such as the Man-
churian railways. He received that
price—although in due course he had
to hand over most of his gains to the
Chinese Communists who by 1949 be-
came the masters of Mainland China.
Edward R. Stettinius tried to ex-
plain what happened at Yalta in his
book “Roosevelt and the Russians: The
Yalta Conference.” By February,
1945, Poland and all Eastern Europe
except for most of Czechoslovakia was
in the hands of the Red Army. As a
result of this situation it was not a
question of what Great Britain and the
United States would permit Russia to
do in Poland, but what the two countries
could persuade the Soviet Union to
accept”.
May be. Still Churchill and Roosevelt
had trump-cards in their hands, in-
cluding the mightiest armed force ever
amassed, which they refused to throw
into the bidding.
Whatever chances there had been to
build a braver new world on the ruins
of the 1939-1945 holocaust were finally
buried at Yalta. Looking at the inter-
national political scene today one can
see the results and implications of that
great failure 20 years ago.

Letters to the Editor
The Film Industry
SIR.—So long as the journalists and so-
called “critics” of Australia continue to
write such defeatist nonsense as Charles
Higham’s “Have Australian Films Any
Future?” (B., February 13), Australian
films never will have any future. We’ll
never find any financiers willing to back
the industry.
Recently I was invited to watch the
filming of Brian Faulks “The'Illusionist”.
This is a 30-minute dance drama written
and directed by Brian Faull, choreo-
graphed by Rex Reid, and starring
Kathleen Gorham, Rex Reid and Jack
Manuel. It was shot in 35mm. East-
man color for wide-screen projection.
The main location was the magnificent
building “Valentines”, now Malvern
Memorial Grammar School, Melbourne.
Over £10,000 worth of carpets, antiques
and chandeliers were brought to the
house, transforming it into not just a
film set but a magnificent and opulent
home. The whole film was shot in 10
days.
I have never before seen a director
with such power, such knowledge and
such control as this 32-year-old Austra-
lian. Veteran of over 500 television pro-
grammes, he is a man who knows what
he is doing and knows where he is go-
ing—and nothing is going to stop him.
If he has a fault it is that he is capable
of working 20 hours a day for weeks on
end and expects all who work with him
to do the same. I saw him at the end
of 10 days’ shooting, after he’d aver-
aged 3 or 4 hours sleep a night, looking
as fresh and as calm and as energetic as
he was on the first day. Here is your
“potential giant of Antonioni or Fellini
calibre”. '
To suggest that life is so comfortable
for us that “it is harder and harder for
people to leave their jobs and go hungry
to make films” is arrant nonsense. It is
not the film-makers who won’t go hun-
gry. It is the film backers and the
cinema circuits who are not prepared
to take risks.
Julie Ann Gray
Glen Iris (Vic.).
SIR.—Charles Higham rather unac-
countably left out certain salient points
in his otherwise informative feature
article. I find it most baffling that Mr
Higham failed to mention Giorgio Man-
giamele’s most recent poetically filmed
attempt to inject some life into the
skeleton of the industry in Australia.
Colin Bennett’s seasoned, critical re-
view of the film “Clay” leaves no doubt
that Giorgio Mangiamele is a camera-
man of world class and as such seems to
refute Higham’s view that “only Dick
Brennan and Douglas White in Sydney
and Tim Burstall in .Melbourne seem to
be making the effort to create personal
films”.
Mr Higham also states in his article
that “no Australian director suggests a
potential giant of the Antonioni or Fel-
lini calibre”. But as early as four years
ago Colin Bennett said in a review:
“Mangiamele brings within our film
horizon a style which echoes in it of
Italian neo-realism. He brings a Zavat-
tini-like eye to the urban Melbourne
migrant scene. To a certain extent he
is a committed angry young man, and
his purpose, like Zavattini’s, is above all
to make us see.”
Les Pitt
East Melbourne (Vic.).
Charles Higham writes: Miss Gray
mentions the excellence of Mr Faull, but
she could hardly have expected me to
comment without having seen a single
finished theatrical film by this director.
Her enthusiasm is agreeable, but one
can only wait for the finished work
before feeling that an injustice has been
done. I cannot, Fm afraid, share Mr
Pitt’s (or Mr Bennett’s) enthusiasm for
“Clay”. And since when were “echoes
of neo-realism” indicative of quality?
Not since Antonioni, surely?
Censorship in NZ
SIR.——I would like to take issue with
your remarks on censorship in New
Zealand (8., February 13). I do not
see that the Cabinet decision on the
hardback edition of “Lady Chatterley’s
Lover” is, as you claim, “a bad pre-
cedent”; nor do I share your fears that
its intervention “must surely undercut
the authority of the supposedly indepen-
dent Tribunal”. When the Cabinet
decision was made known in the NZ
Press, it did not appear to excite any
adverse comment from opponents of
censorship. The actual decision surely
reinforces the authority of the Tribunal,
which appears to be far more liberal
and effective than is the case in Aus-
tralia.

SIR. —Robert Morley, who has always
regarded himself as a popular figure of
fun, would welcome any evidence in the
form of letters, anecdotes and insults
that either substantiate, or demolish, the
image. He would be most grateful if
any of your readers in possession of
such evidence would forward it to me

FORUM
The World’s Most
Generous Colonisers
But still the prisoners of race ...
By J. H. WOOTTEN
A ustralians like to see themselves as
a friendly egalitarian people, free
of snobbery and class or racial preju-
dice. The easy comradeship that often
developed between Australian service-
men and New Guinea natives during the
war fitted well with this national image.
Ironically enough the natives found this
relationship so different from their re-
lationship with the pre-war Australian
residents that many thought the soldiers
were a different people. In some places
they contrasted the pre-war “English”
with the war-time “Australians”.
After the war most of the soldiers
left, but some remained to become
civilians. A lot of pre-war residents re-
turned, but were soon outnumbered by
newcomers from Australia. Yet, until
relatively recently, relationships be-
tween the races seemed to be settling
back into the pre-war pattern. It has
been rare to find an alternative to the
“master” - “boy” relationship usually
shorn of the physical brutality that had
marked it in some parts of pre-war New
Guinea, but still bereft of equal human
respect and sympathy, and often of
elementary good manners. Natives have
felt that “white men” regarded them not
as fellow human beings but as tools or
domestic animals, well-cared for and
courteously addressed by the enlight-
ened, abused and insulted by the ignor-
ant or neurotic, but accepted as an equal
by none.
In their hearts most Europeans in the
Territory (who were after all of the
same people... as the war-time troops)
have probably disliked the situation. In-
deed in an effort to change it there was
a regression to verbal magic which would
have done credit to the most primitive
sorcerer. Blame was attached to the
word “native'’ which was henceforth to
be taboo and avoided by such artificial
circumlocutions as “indigene”, “indigen-
ous inhabitant” and “indigenous
people”. To those who do not believe
in magic, it would seem obvious that if
such an accurate and neutral term as
“native” could become a dirty word,
there must be a dirty situation which
unless changed would soon soil any
word which replaced it.
Why then did the racial barriers that
often lifted in the war close down again
in peace?
Equality and mutual sympathy come
naturally, easily, and almost inevitably
between men who sleep in the same mud,
bathe in the same stream, eat the same
food together, are perforce equally
smelly and dirty, share the same fears
and the same protection, and rely on
each other for their lives. A similar
bond existed between some pre-war
patrol officers and their native police.
But the same relationship does not
come easily between men divided on
racial lines into those who eat rich and
varied foods in good houses and those
who have plain and monotonous diets
in shacks and huts; those whose basic
wage is £2O a week, and those for whom
it is £3 a week; those who are allowed
to drink and those who are not; those
for whom cleanliness and hygiene is
made effortless and those for whom
it is burdensome; those who drive cars
and those who walk in their bare feet;
those who have attained their full
physical vigor and those who have
been debilitated in childhood by mal-
aria, hookworm and lack of protein;
those who have been educated from
childhood to the skills their society
needs and those who have been cata-
pulted unprepared into a strange and
rapidly changing society.
In such a situation many a European
will tend to feel unconscious guilt at his
undeserved and fortuitous monopoly of
the advantages, and the simplest way to
make the situation bearable is to
rationalise it in terms of European
superiority and native inferiority. It is
in any event much easier to assume the
native is stupid or lazy than to make
the intellectual effort necessary to
understand the complexity of traditional
native society and the difficult problems
of adjustment to Western society.
On his side, the native may feel re-
sentment or hopelessness. If the power
situation makes it unsafe or painful to
express his resentment, he may lapse
into apathetic indifference, or find a
solution to his frustrations in such wish-
fulfilment fantasies as the cargo cult. In
either event he will provide fuel to feed
the myth of European superiority.
In such a situation mutual fear and
suspicion grow and misunderstanding is
compounded by the lack of an effective
means of communication. Few Euro-
peans have learnt native languages,
which are difficult. Until recently few
natives spoke English, which is also
difficult. Pidgin English appears decep-
tively easy, and few Europeans speak
it really well. Many think they do and
attribute the resultant misunderstandings
to native stupidity.
Race relations in the Territory are,
to a considerable degree, still bad. Dur-
ing a recent visit to the Territory a
sensitive Australian woman told me her
blood ran cold at the way women in
Port Moresby talked about natives
often in front of native servants who
could understand much of what was
said. Elsewhere I saw an Assistant Dis-
trict Commissioner behave with con-
summate (but perhaps quite uncon-
scious) rudeness to a passing native of
whom he wished to seek some local in-
formation. Most officers do not behave
■like that, a local native told me, but
there are still quite a number who do.
A very senior Administration officer
told me of his feelings when he saw a
white woman get into a crowded bus
and say to a native “Get out of that
seat, you black bastard”. “I might have
worked all day trying to make one
friend for Australia, and she had made
30 enemies in as many seconds. That
sort of thing doesn't happen as much as
it used to, but it still happens.”
Apart from positive acts, one can
point also to the large area where re-
lationships have been excluded. Most
clubs are in practice racially exclusive;
drinking (now permitted to natives) has
tended to produce racially separate bars
in most hotels; home visiting between
races is unknown for most people.
These are a few of the symptoms of
a depressing pattern of race relations
which is almost inescapable in a situ-
ation where education, economic privi-
lege and political power have been
largely demarked by racial boundaries.
Almost inescapable, but not quite, for
there have always been . magnificent ex-
ceptions to the pattern. Particularly in
the Administration there have often
been men who have the stresses
not by asserting superiority but by con-

structive work to improve the situation.
In all walks of life there have been
happy men with apparently impreg-
nable personalities who exude goodwill
to all under all conditions. And there
have, been a few with a Christ-like love
for their fellow-man and obliviousness
to material values.
On their side the natives, once they
have reached a certain level of sophis-
tication, have felt the humiliation of the
pattern keenly, a fact appreciated by
few of the Europeans who are them-
selves prisoners of the pattern. It is
difficult to say how deep or permanent
the wounds are, but such psychiatric
evidence as exists is disturbing. On the
surface the natives seem to .have re-
mained remarkably forgiving, and quick
to respond to changes in the pattern
and departures from it. However, it is
well to remember that they have had
little alternative to submission the
humiliation of the “cheeky” native has
usually been swift and complete, even
if no harsher weapon than sarcasm has
been employed. Fortunately natives are
quick to see the comic side of Euro-
pean posturing, and there is often a
comedian among them who can resolve
pent-up feelings into gales of laughter
by superb satire or mimicry of the
author of their humiliation. The acute
racial tension of some African and
Asian colonies, likely to flare into acts
of mob violence, has not developed in
New Guinea. Tom Mboya did not con-
ceal his surprise at seeing Europeans
moving freely among a vast gathering
of natives without armed police or
soldiery in the background.
The power tables turned
'Nevertheless the pattern remains, and
might well be the dominant impression
of race relations for a newcomer to the
Territory. But for one who returns to
the Territory today after a substantial
absence, there is a more hopeful im-
pression. The old pattern is crumbling
at the edges at many points. Downright
rudeness in dealing with natives is be-
coming less common; courtesy is no
longer exceptional. The number of
natives who can count real European
friendships, backed by visiting between
families, is still small, but is increasing.
The Europeans involved are no longer
regarded as peculiar by their fellows.
It is possible to stay as a guest in a
native home without exciting much
comment. Mixed race sporting teams
and competitions are considered normal.
It is becoming uncommon even in
private enterprise to assume that all but
menial jobs require Europeans. Some
European surgery patients in Port
Moresby Hospital are still aghast when
they find that their anaesthetist is a
native, but they invariably accept his
services and apologise profusely for their
hesitation when it is all over. Lawyers,
once considered a conservative group,
are working hard to get legal education
for natives, and cultivate potential
students and entertain them in their
homes. In Port Moresby a women’s
association had Hanuabada women to its
Christmas party and enjoyed it. Kokopo,
a traditional planter stronghold, is
delighted with its first native postmaster.
A few natives even exercise authority
over Europeans. In Goroka recently a
native police officer arrested a European,
and while some people were
it was accepted in good part*. In the
House of Assembly European elected
members proposed a native as leader of
the House.
Many factors are contributing to the
change. Part of the credit must go to
the Australian Government and the
Administration which have worked
patiently as a matter of policy to elim-
inate discrimination, and have often
pursued the policy courageously to its
logical conclusion. The lifting of the
prohibition on native drinking, for
example, was not an easy decision, for
expensive liquor is undoubtedly a social
problem to people on low cash incomes.
Credit must also go to many individuals
who have worked, often in voluntary
capacities, to bring about the many
small occasions of racial co-operation
and friendly contact.
But there are more fundamental rea-
sons. As the Government’s work in the
fields of educational, economic, and
political development starts to bear fruit,
the old racial divisions are increasingly
blurred. There are starting to be signi-
ficant numbers of natives as well educa-
ted as, or better educated than, many
Europeans in the Territory. Meaning-
ful professional bonds are developing
between people of different race. The
increasing Westernisation of natives
makes it easier for individuals of the
two races to find common interests. Be-
fore the recent Public Service salary
cuts there was a growing body of
natives who could afford homes and
meals to which they could invite Euro-
peans without embarrassment, although
if present policy continues this advan-
tage will be confined to native poli-
ticians, businessmen and private prac-
titioners in the professions.
Most important of all is the looming
political power of the natives. Nobody
doubts any more that they will attain
self-government within what would, not
long ago, have seemed an absurdly
short period. The power tables are about
to be turned, and old attitudes no longer
make sense.

THE PRINCELY HOLIDAY
G IQ
relations is thus inevitable, and by re-
sisting it Europeans would court dis-
aster. The encouraging thing is that
many of them are accepting it grace-
fully, even eagerly, almost with relief.
On the native side, there seems on the
surface to be a great deal of willing-
ness to accept changes in European
attitudes with quiet magnanimity, and
without much brooding about the past.
However, there is still much to keep old
hurts alive, and continued native good-
will-is not something to be assumed.
The real testing point of race relations
may well not be the attitudes of the
local Australian residents, but those of
the Australian community at large. Two
critical points are already emerging
one is immigration and the White Aus-
tralia policy, the other is the extent of
our willingness to continue and increase
financial assistance.
Papuans are Australian citizens, but
are they to be free to settle permanently
in Australia? To date Australia has
been able to control their movements
on paternalistic grounds, but what of
the White Australia policy?
In recent years Australia has pro-
vided New Guinea with generous fin-
ance, but the limits have been revealed
by the recent Public Service salary cuts.
Until these cuts were made native public
servants received the same basic sala-
ries as Europeans. Now they are to
receive a markedly lower salary (e.g.,
a fully qualified native medical practi-
tioner will start on about £9 12s. a
week), which they are told is related
to the economic capacity of their
country. I am not concerned here with
the rights and wrongs of the decision,
but only with its implications for race
relations. Within the Territory these are
serious., A native inevitably feels dis-
crimination when he works alongside a
European, doing the same work for a
fraction of his. pay. In addition there is
an economic barrier to equal social
relations —a round of drinks costs the
same for both.
As between Australia and New Guinea,
the implication is that Australia is pre-
pared to assist the people of New
Guinea only to a standard of living
markedly below its own. The fact that
Australia is still treating New Guinea
far more generously than other colonial
powers have treated their colonies will
not make the decision palatable to those
whose expectations have been crushed.
When it is coupled with a refusal, for
racial reasons, to allow natives to come
to Australia where they could earn the
higher standard of living by their own
efforts, it is likely to provide a basis
for the growth of racial bitterness. It is
well to consider how our history may
look through other eyes. As they may
see it, we moved into a continent occu-
pied by a colored people, reduced them
by slaughter or neglect to harmless
numbers, and now as a matter of policy
exclude all colored people from follow-
ing us —even Australian citizens from
Papua who speak our language and have
been educated by us to absorb our own
culture and way of life. Even a generous
handout may not still such attitudes
permanently.


" The Bulletin” Poets
No coteries
By R. A. SIMPSON
In his “Keep the Aspidistra Flying”,
Cieorge Orwell paints a grim picture
of Gordon Comstock receiving a
rejection slip for his two poems sent to
the editor of “Primrose”. The reader’s
feelings go out to the unfortunate
litterateur who is a “social failure,
artistic failure, sexual failure”. The
editor of “Primrose” could not be
blamed for the social and sexual predica-
ments of Gordon Comstock, but “the
last twist of the knife” was the rejection
slip decorated with a design of funereal
laurel leaves.
The editor is seen as a rather brutal
fellow with a warped sense of humor.
As a consequence, it is possibly a good
thing for a poetry editor to give poets
some idea of how callous and prejudiced
he really was.
Douglas Stewart was both literary and
poetry editor of The Bulletin, and
Vincent Buckley followed on from him
in the limited capacity of poetry editor.
In 1963 I took over from Vincent
Buckley, and soon there will be a new
editor dealing with all poetry.
Any person who hopes to satisfactorily
undertake the important job of reading
the many poems submitted yearly to
The Bulletin must be aware of ghosts,
the past (particularly the formidable
figure of Douglas Stewart), and yet he
must also be keenly aware of what is
happening with new talents. The Gordon
Comstocks, if they have ability, should
not be crushed by the editorial hand, and
often a poetry editor must act as a
creative writing school. The Bulletin
has always been quick to publish new,
young writers, and I feel this is one of
its most important functions as a medium
for creative material.
A considerable amount of poetry pub-
lished in The Bulletin has been by
poets at a middle stage of development,
poets who have had one or two books
published, or a body of work in maga-
zines and anthologies, but who have not
reached th£ status of such, figures as
Judith Wright, A. D. Hope, or R. D.
Fitzgerald. And there are always
people ready to damn these poets be-
cause, it seems, the poets concerned
have not reached full poetic maturity
or because they do not write poems like
the older generation. Such short-
sightedness is disturbing, particularly
since many good poems are being writ-
ten by Rodney Hall, Thomas W. Shap-
cott, Bruce Dawe, Chris Wallace-Crabbe,
Bruce Beaver, Vivian Smith, Alexander
Craig, Francis Webb, Charles Higham,
Noel Macainsh and Evan Jones.
All these poets are trying to achieve
different things, and it would be pre-
sumptuous on my part to attempt to
clarify individual aims with a few words.
Such a haphazard list of names of
some of the poets who have published
poems in The Bulletin over the last
twelve months will show mainly, I hope,
that the poems have been varied. It
seems to me variety and balance are
most desirable, and a publication such as
The Bulletin should not produce a
school, a coterie of poets; this is the
realm of little, way-out magazines (a
phenomenon sadly lacking in Australia
at the moment) which narrow themselves
to an idea or movement but which may
have much wider significance than is
apparent when they are operating.
Tn this article, R. A. Simpson, the
retiring Poetry Editor of The
Bulletin, surveys the poetry he has
selected for publication since 1963.
The Bulletin publishes more poetry
than any other Australian magazine
and is glad of the opportunity pub-
licly to acknowledge its appreciation
of Mr Simpson’s work.
Later this year Charles Higham,
The Bulletin’s Literary Editor, will
take over the selection of poetry.
Poets, like many people these days,
are often cautious of extremism. After
so many years of wars, horrors and
uncertainty, and with the threat of even
worse things, it is understandable that
poets should be dissatisfied with beliefs,
institutions, masks, abstractions—and
that they should want to get to the
truth of things through the most direct
way possible; that is, through truthful
examinations of their own experiences.
And the best poetry will always come
to the surface, and will have real value:
as James Reeves has said:
“. . . the value of the poet to society
is that he has always insisted as much
as possible on his right to personal
identity. It may be that modern man
is losing the desire for individual
living and prefers to take shelter with
a group. The volume of mass think-
ing has grown alarmingly with the
perfection of mass communication.
If this is so, then the salt has lost its
savour; a savourless existence is not
worth having. In these circumstances
the poet has a function of peculiar
importance ... it is his especial duty
to keep his responses to experience
fresh and vital, to refuse to be sub-
merged by any group, to refuse to
surrender his identity.”
Poets need poetry editors, and poetry
editors need poets. 1 may sit back* as
I am doing now in my retirement, and
give personal feelings about the state of
the world, but I was primarily governed
by the quality of the work submitted;
and most of the poets who appeared in
The Bulletin also appeared in the
other publications, which feature poetry
in this country: the same names keep
cropping up and it is not difficult to
gain impressions and to formulate
opinions about the trends and currents
being created.
At the moment the generalisations
that flit into my mind are: Recent Aus-
tralian poetry is mostly very sophistica-
ted, but, like English poetry, it is much
less vigorous than American poetry—a
nucleus of poems concerned with per-
sonal experiences tell of trivial experi-
ences that do not transcend the mun-
dane —imagery and language can be
unexciting and one would like to find
vivid things like “Lensed in a bubble’s
ghostly camera”. Poets expert in
descriptive poetry, poets with a keen eye
for detail such as W. Hart-Smith and
Roland Robinson, are producing some
excellent poems. Noel Macainsh’s
poetry, after what seemed to be a fairly
quiet phase, is becoming much more
adventurous.
It seems a number of poets would like
to break through the barriers of
language and conventional forms and
arrive at new and shattering statements,
but are not very certain of how to pro-
ceed. At a time when poems are often
quiet and cautious, the large and explo-
sive poetry of a person such as Francis
Webb is often looked upon with the
same embarrassment which accompanies
a rude noise at a conventional party.
However, Webb’s work at its best has a
grandeur and power well above the
ordinary.
Like their counterparts overseas, many
Australian poets seem preoccupied with
the need to be “modern”. Though they
may feel that extremism in ideas and
politics is a bad thing, they are continu-
ally confronted with the problem of
finding the right and new form to con-
tain their inspirations. Up to the ’sixties
each decade could be treated conveni-
ently with a tag, although the best poets
transcend tags. The ’thirties were poli-
tical, the ’forties were subjective and
romantic, and the ’fifties produced care-
fully contained ironies, but, as yet, a
tag eludes the ’sixties. During the first
years of the ’sixties a number of poets
have concerned themselves with the
difficulties of “free verse” and syllabics.

Though there has been little syllabic
writing in Australia, there has been a
tendency to knock form about a little
and treat it in a freer fashion: this, of
course, is o; v a surface “modernism”
and a long way from the kind of poetry
that creates its own logic and structure
and is behind Eliot’s remark when he
says: “It is always true to say that form
and content are the same thing.”
There is a vague idea that “modern-
ism”, discovery in poetry, has never
really kept pace with the developments
that have occurred in music and paint-
ing—Pound and Eliot did all the hard
work but very little progress has been
made since those poets. A recent issue
of “The London Magazine” has gone
into this subject with some detail.
"Out regardless of individual concerns
about “modernism”, from Pound and
Eliot onwards American poets have
been powerful and influential, and
during recent years their influence ap-
pears to have increased. Alexander
Craig and Evan Jones have both studied
in America, and apart from his subject-
matter (“Collegetown: Eastern USA”),
Craig’s poems show his attitude to
poetry has undergone a radical change:
tw'o small examples, “Leftover Lines”
and “Observation”, w t ere published in
The Bulletin last year, and such
poems show he is moving toward the
world of William Stafford and other
Americans.
Evan Jones has been writing strong,
confessional-type poems. It would be
wrong to say these poems have been
influenced by anybody in particular and
yet they have affinities with Robert
Lowell, “Life Studies”, and W. D. Snod-
grass. “Heart’s Needle”. I believe a
considerable amount of the poetry Jones
has published since “Inside the Whale”
rises above the general poetic level in
this country.
As I have said, there has been a lack
of real experimentation in Australian
poetry, and Judith Wright arrives at the
core of the situation when she says, in
the issue of “The London Magazine”
dealing with “modern” poetry, that “The
‘modernist revolution’ did not occur in
Australia, probably because there was no
need of it. We inherit the machines, but
have been only on the periphery of the
development that produced them; as for
a local ‘crisis of belief’, it is possible to
maintain that we have never believed in
anything, we were born too late for
that.” The problem of “modernism” then
simply becomes the problem of “free
verse” and many poets seem to think
that all they have to do to write “free
verse” is break up ordinary metrical
verse. There is also a tendency to con-
centrate on “serious” subjects, and wit
and lightness of touch are neglected.
However, Bruce Dawe has a real sense
of humor and a racy, Cummingesque
style and is capturing Australian speech
rhythms. Chris Wallace-Crabbe has a
natural Mozartian lightness, through
which he communicates his profundities,
and poems such as “Carnations” and
“An Allegiance” show development and
a new freedom.
Looking back over the “poetry pages”
of The Bulletin for the last twelve to
fifteen months, I realised that there are
a number of poems which stand out
and are worth recalling: Vincent Buck-
ley’s “We Suit Our Memories”, Thomas
W. Shapcott’s “Aubade”, Rodney Hall’s
“Under the Icebergs”, Bruce Beaver’s
“Home Sonnets” and Charles Higham's
“At Blaze-of-Noon”. And one of the
most satisfying things is to see the num-
ber of newer names with good poems to
their credit: Wendy Horowitz’s “Bush
Walk” and “Song of a Jew”, Mark
Young's “The Two Islands”, Lola Jack-
son’s “At Dover”, Tim Bass’ “Poem”
and “Seven: Bluestocking’’, and Juliet
Waldorf’s “America”.
Tim Bass and Wendy Horowitz, two
young poets with much promise, both
live in Sydney, and this fact could be
of particular interest to those people
who find some interest in considering the
regional aspects of Australian literature.
And this prompts me to make one last
remark in my own defence: I have often
been blamed for living in Melbourne,
and it seems I must naturally favor Mel-
bourne poets but figures show other-
wise. The Bulletin published 71 poems
over the last 12 months and only 18
were by poets south of the border.


REVIEWS
BALLET
Helpmann’s Japanese Legend
By JOANNE PRIEST
Yugen. Robert Helpmann. The Australian
Ballet. Her Majesty’s Theatre, Adelaide.
In a footnote to his ballet “Yugen”,
Robert Helpmann explains the title as
“the highest ideal of the aesthetic con-
cept of Noh”. The Japanese legend of
the moon goddess and the fisherman
provides a wonderful canvas for the
choreographer's skilful application of his
art. For those wedded to classical
ballet as a dance form there may be
some dull moments, but not many.
The members of the company are as
usual, very much behind Helpmann.
They are so W'ell disciplined that they
make the most difficult and unfamiliar
steps and movements look as though
they have grown up with them. Only
Kathleen Gorham as Tsukiyomi, the
moon goddess, dances on points. Since
the use of points in classical ballet was
introduced to indicate flight it is apropos
that she does. She surprises and delights
with reticence seldom seen in her work.
And a deft and expert use of the fan
when she becomes earthbound writes
“paid” to months of devoted and intelli-
gent practice.
The dance which shows her swimming
in the lagoon is a masterpiece. Not even
our Australian youths could revel so
completely in a joyful splashing and
swirling and tumbling and floating, cared
for always by the clever manipulation
and, so it seems, loving watchfulness of
her moon followers, Colin Peasley and
"Your hair is like nylon, your eyes
are like sputniks, your cheeks are
like terylene .."
Roger Meyers. And the dappled, shim-
mering light on the waves and water is
sheer delight. William Akers must have
full marks for this.
Garth Welch as Hakuryo the fisher-
man, makes himself felt even in the
slightest of his movements.
There is a captivating pas de deux
with Barbara Chambers and Robert
Olup. Instead of the pirouettes and
fouettes of the classics we have the
bewitching movements of fans and
umbrellas, the silken waves of the
lagoon, fish baskets and fishing nets.
The decor is very simple: tightly-
stretched gauze screens, wings of slatted
wood and four elegant borders hanging
from the ceiling. The costumes are
almost without exception, either breath-
catching or quaintly appealing. The
rhusic is delightful: one is surprised that
western instruments can sound so Asian
and that Yuzo Toyama writes music
which really dances. There are lovely
flute passages: a combination of piccolo
and chanchiki (a little gong especially
sent from Japan wdth the score), then
suddenly nothing but drums and mokoto
(the round and hollow wood block also
sent from Japan). Robust and tender,
full and thin in turn, with great sweep-
ing string passages, this is one of the
most satisfying commissioned scores the
company has had.
If one wonders w'hy Helpmann takes
a Japanese Noh theme for the subject of
a ballet, it is all there in his footnotes,
in which he expresses his belief that this
young company should draw on the
legends, music and culture of their near
neighbors.
THEATRE
Years of the Tumbril
Poor Bitos. Jean Anouilh. St Martin’s
Theatre, Melbourne.
La Belle Helene. Victorian Opera Com-
pany. Russell St Theatre, Melbourne.
One can see why Anouilh was hesitant
about this play being performed outside
France. Between its two themes one, the
unresolved civil war between the Repub-
lic and her enemies, is handled with a
ferocity hard to make believable, and
impossible to make attractive to Anglo-
Saxons. Its intense dialogue demands a
special rhetoric few actors can achieve
without blurring the domestic outline of
the characters. That the experiment
comes within an ace of succeeding in
Melbourne is due to the imaginative
direction of a newcomer to Australia,
Maxwell Jackson.
The drama’s second strand is conven-
tional enough. In psychological cross-
fertilisation, great figures of the revolu-
tion Saint-Just, Danton, Mirabeau,
Tallien, the Queen and, foremost,
Robespierre are shown as present-day
types. The parallels with proletarian and
counter-revolutionary dictatorships are,
if anything, too obvious to be accurate.
Robespierre, who in contemporary life
is Bitos, an assistant public prosecutor
with a harsh record after the liberation,
is shown as an embittered frustrate; in
the old days a vengeful puritan with a
cruel childhood, and today a woman-
fearing pedant, not without ideals.
Invited to a dinner attended by for-
mer class-mates in period wigs, and mer-
cilessly bullied by these men and their
females, wealthy provincials all, poor,
awkward Bitos assumes the part of the
seagreen incorruptible.
At their table he is one against all;
which, while heightening the tension,
makes it very difficult for any but the
best actors to demarcate their individual-
ity. This cramping extends into the realm
of the physical. The problem becomes
less important in the brilliant sequence
of flashbacks to the years of the tumb-
ril, particularly in a beautifully staged
scene between Robespierre and Mira-
beau (Kenric Hudson) and in Robespi-
erre's cell: in the latter his two gaolers
bring a touch of mastery to minor parts.
Near the end when, following a mock
attempt on Bitos's life, there is a chil-
lingly effective false reconciliation, the
synthesis between now and then is
theatrically accomplished. It is at this
stage that, through the person of Vic-
toire (otherwise Lucille Desmoulins),
touchingly portrayed by Judith Arthy,
goodness tries to assert itself over the
soul's violence. She alone recognises the
lost child in the tyrant.
Like Anouilh's “The Lark'', but less
poetically, this play, almost too profuse
in cross-currents, appeals to the historical
intellect by way of universal passions. It
calls for heroic talents in the chief prota-
gonist. Michael Duffield has the correct
stance and tongue-tied eloquence: he
comes very close to realising both the
monster and the outcast. Keith Lee is a
strong Saint-Just and hate-filled dinner
host, and there are no real failures
among his companions. The resources of
a little theatre are not limitless, but the
sets are outstanding, and St Martin’s
deserves well for giving us this controver-

sial and stimulating work. It is not as
profound and moving as “Antigone”, but
it surpasses “Becket” in both craft and
ideas. It is better theatre than Buechner’s
“Danton’s Death”.
The Victorian Opera Company seems
set for a big year. Its programme, which
includes Brecht's and Weill’s “Maha-
gonny”, has started most promisingly
with a short season of Offenbach’s “La
Belle Helene”. Battling the awful acous-
tics at Russell Street, Ron Field’s pro-
duction has polish, is quite splendidly
dressed, and boasts sets, a chorus and
an orchestra professionals might envy.
Only the ballet does not come up to
scratch. The two principals, Margaret
Field, as Helene, and Brian Clough, as
Achilles, are fine singers and brave
mimes. Miss Field has also seen to the
adapting.
There is nothing amateurish about the
handling of the huge cast. The soloists
are a little uneven they'll change
every night but the entertainment
sends you home humming and very
pleased.
DAVID MARTIN
Feeble Monarch
Richard of Bordeaux. Gordon Daviot. Ge-
nesian Theatre, Sydney.
Village Wooing. George Bernard Shaw.
Q Theatre, Sydney.
The only interesting character in
“Richard of Bordeaux” goes off to
France, exile and death very early in
the piece. He is Robert de Vere, Earl of
Oxford, who is stylishly played by Peter
Carroll.
Neither hero nor villain, Richard II
is not a promising subject for drama.
Shakespeare extracts poetry and pity
from the deposition and murder of this
weak and overdressed monarch. But
Gordon Daviot is no poet. And a series
of historical incidents strung together
without compelling themes is not drama.
The chief interest of this competent but
unexciting dramatic exercise is to em-
phasise, by contrast, the genius of Shake-
speare.
Shaw’s anti-romantic idyll is ideally
suited for lunch-hour theatre. Cinderella
marries her Prince Charming in the end,
but she is a down-to-earth village shop-
assistant and telephonist while he is a
priggish widower who earns his living
by writing tourist guide-books.
By failing to give Shaw’s anti-romanti-
cism its full value Frank Harvey’s pro-
duction loses some of the flavor of his
romanticism.
Judi Farr could add a dimension to her
performance by varying her genteel “tele-
phone” voice with an unpolished provin-
cial accent, thus bringing out more clearly
the contrast between her natural candor
and her assumed gentility. She is much
more of a “character” than Miss Farr
makes her.
So too is the man, who is a sketch for
Professor Higgins: testy, pedantic and
wary of women. John Unicomb makes
him too gentle and charming and so mis-
ses the full force of the dramatic relief
when his resistance to village wooing
finally cracks.

matte gouaches, Pro Hart’s sugary oils
and Keith Looby’s saccharine fairy tales.
On the theory that in painting nothing
is so reckless as obeying the rules,
Looby and Hart are charged with being
lore-abiding citizens. Fairweather’s cur-
vilinear cutie-pies peeping out from be-
hind crazy-quilt color patches offer the
look of art without its disturbing con-
tent.
The camera-club nudes and snap-shot
landscapes of John Yule at Farmer’s
Blaxland Gallery confuse real life with
reel-life. Unaware of practically every
quality that distinguishes painting from
photography, the works rely heavily on
lighting, close-up, picturesque setting,
character study and charming anecdotal
detail of only moderate Leicability.
Godfrey Miller’s memorial retrospec-
tive at the Darlinghurst Galleries reveals
a brush that looked before leaping, then
carefully sat down. Miller's anaesthe-
tised passion commands restrained ad-
miration. Revered even in his lifetime
as a first rank avant-God of Australian
art it is obvious that he could not paint,
was no colorist and, though he could,
would not draw. The characteristic
gesture in all Miller's painting is a criss-
crossing network of high tension lines
temporarily trapping little spots of
color. The tesserae-shaped interstices
become way-stations for color on the
high road to freedom; they are seen
again elsewhere, having escaped the
forms that imprisoned them. Miller’s
virtues are subtle. His weaknesses are
glaringly obvious; his figuration is
unameliorably incompatible with his
fundamentally abstract moralistic pole-
mic. His obedience to a system is so
absolute it would indicate a servile auto-
maton beneath contempt if he did not,
paradoxically, infuse a unique and
assertively personal factor. For so
deep was Miller's conviction, so com-
plete his humility and so fierce his
dedication that the slow and sober linear
scaffolding he patiently built results in
monuments of great strength and
dignity.

Jack Clayton is one of the most interest-
ing of contemporary directors, inventive
and masterly in his handling of actors.
His “Room At The Top” started a still
current realist genre of English films;
Clayton’s next film was the elegant,
aristocratic “The Innocents”; now “The
Pumpkin Eater” takes us to upper-
middle-class London where money is no
problem. Clayton is an acute observer
of whatever social stratum he is dealing
with, but he is no sociologist; his interest
is in the people of the story, and their
social and financial position is only of
importance in so far as it affects their
characters and emotions.
In this story of an uneasy marriage
built on love but little mutual under-
standing, the acting is very distinguished.
Anne Bancroft is excellent as the warm-
hearted, passionate, infuriating wife. In
this, as well as the work of Simone
Signoret in “Room At The Top” and
Deborah Kerr in “The Innocents”, Clay-
ton has helped produce one of the finest
of female performances in recent
English cinema.
Roger Corman’s “The Masque Of
The Red Death” is, like many of his
films, inspired by Edgar Allan Poe. The
film has style and elegance, particularly
in the use of the color camera, and a
more than usually literate script — l l
noticed on the credits the name of
Charles Beaumont, who worked on the
script for “Dr Lao”. Corman does
manage to evoke a genuine atmosphere
of decadence and evil by implication
rather than overt statement, and Vin-
cent Price is just the actor to help him.
Harold Robbins’ novel “The Carpet-
baggers” is badly written, sensational
and improbable, but compulsively read-
able. Edward Dmytryk's screen version
retains all the improbability and makes
a few tentative attempts at sensation-
alism, but it is ponderously directed and
its writing is often laughably silly.
George Peppard, a capable actor, does
his best to bring to life the character of
the ruthless tycoon who destroys all
who love him because he’s afraid of
going mad (even Mr Robbins, who put
practically every known psychological
aberration into his book, didn't think
of that one). An interesting newcomer
from the New York stage, Elizabeth
Ashley, shows charm and promise in the
role of his unhappy wife.
“The Suitor”, of which Pierre Etaix is
both director and star, arrives with an
enviable critical reputation. To me it
was a sad disappointment.
Etaix, a vaudevillian and disciple of
Jacques Tati, has made something of a
name for himself with his short films—
none shown here, to my knowledge.
Probably this w'as his true medium
short sequences in “The Suitor - ’ are
stylish and funny but the film as a
whole is merely a collection of sight
gags loosely linked by pedestrian
narrative.

A Challenge from the North
By LEONIE KRAMER
New Statesman and Nation. Common-
wealth Literature Issue, January 29,
1965. Is. 3d.
Some thirty years ago, in “Five Visions
of Captain Cook”, Kenneth Slessor exa-
mined the mystery of courage in ex-
ploration. What impulse drove Cook to
turn his face away from the comforting
voyage home, and to sail into the
dangerous waters of the unknown South
Land? In asking the question he drew
an analogy which in one line moved
the poem out of the South Seas into
the much deeper waters navigated by
the mental traveller. Cook did not
simply accept a challenge. He offered
one. In Cook's stubborn ambition
Slessor recognises his own, and that of
his colleagues. “So men write poems in
Australia”.
It is doubtful whether Slessor now,
or any of his contemporaries and suc-
cessors, would see the demands of their
art in qffite the same terms as he did in
writing that poem. This is not to say that
Australian writers are no longer explor-
ers, or no longer responsive to the chal-
lenges offered by their, vocation. To
the artist each new venture is an ex-
ploration, the success or failure of
which is known, perhaps, only to him-
self, and certainly can be measured only
approximately by even the most percep-
tive reader. Yet, thanks to the efforts
of men like Slessor, there is more com-
pany in Australia today for the writer-,
navigator. The seas may not be tamed
or charted, but they are not as empty
as they used to be; and on their shores
there are groups, however small, of
watchers and well-wishers.
Unfortunately, though, there are also
appearing on the scene some strange
and exceedingly vocal prophets and
professional analysts, who devote them-
selves to grandiose sociological specula-
tion, and who are much given to large
predictions. These remarks are pro-
voked by a recent number of the “New
Statesman” containing a section on
Commonwealth literature which is as
remarkable for its omissions as for its
strange prognostications. There are
articles on Indian, African, Malayan
and West Indian writing. Australian,
New Zealand and Canadian literature is
passed by, and might be thought not to
exist were not a few books listed in
publishers’ advertisements. Glancing
references are made to a few writers in
a curious article on Sydney by Peter
Porter. It might be a report of one of
Voss’ nightmares; and it ends with a
warning to intending migrants that
though they will be met at the ship,
somewhere there may be a Mrs Jolley,
“waiting to bring the threads together
for your crucifixion”.
If you happen to read this first, you
will be prepared in mood for the article
by Dan Jacobson, which sets the tone
for the comments on Commonwealth
literature, and which, unless you are a
really crude colonial, will fill you with
despair at your own backwardness.
Jacobson develops an argument about
Commonwealth literature in terms of an
opposition between provincial and
metropolitan culture. He seeks first to
establish the remoteness of English
(that is to say metropolitan) writers
from the affairs of the colonies. “Great
Expectations” is, produced as evidence
that, “like young Pip, the gentlemen of
England preferred for the most part not
to know the truth about just where, and
how, and by whom, their fortunes were
being made”, and that Dickens simply
made a structural convenience of Aus-
tralia. (Surely this is a naive view of
the novel. Magwitch casts a menacing
shadow into every corner of the book;
and he offers a grim comment upon
provincial England. What could be more
pointed than the contrast between the
violence and disorder of his life, and the
flimsy miniature London fortress of Mr
Wemmick?) Defoe, Forster and Con-
rad, it is claimed,, are exceptions to the
general rule that the colonies exist for
exploitation. Their writing represents
one level of achievement; that of Dis-
raeli and Kipling another. Of recent
writers only Orwell and Evelyn Waugh
showed an awareness that “something of
importance to the world, and something
that involved them directly as English-
men, was taking place in the colonial
territories”.
Up to this point Mr Jacobson appears
to be out of sympathy with the indiffer-
ence of all but a few English writers to
the expanding colonial world outside
their snug island. Yet his attitude is in
fact ambiguous. He finds it startling
“that Lawrence should have thought
seriously of settling in Australia, and
should have written a book about the
place”. (The use of the word “place”
is itself revealing.) Moreover he feels
justified in being startled since Lawrence
stayed for only three months. But one
is surely startled by such a notion only
if one is as dedicated to the provincial-
metropolitan opposition as Mr Jacob-
son turns out to be. When one con-
siders that Lawrence saw provincialism
where Mr Jacobson sees metropolitan
sophistication—namely in the England
he cheerfully left—one must be sur-
prised not at Lawrence's “exile” but at
Jacobson’s misunderstanding of it.
And so, via D. H. Lawrence, he
arrives at the centre of his argument. He
quotes a recent remark of Auden, “The
dominions . . . are for me tiefste Pro-
vinz, places which have produced no
art and are inhabited by the kind of
person with whom I have least in
common . . .” While Jacobson mildly
rebukes Auden for his “uncharitable
attitude”, he nevertheless accepts his
basic provincial-metropolitan distinction,
and further claims that it will continue
to hold true of “the literary cultures of
the new countries and that of England”.
In challenging this view one does,
of course, invite the charge of provin-
cialism, and it is extremely difficult to
resist throwing it back at the so-called
metropolis. I am increasingly persuaded
that all this chatter about dependent cul-
tures and centres of the literary industry
is wide of the mark. I further think
that it is very depressing that _some
groups of “intellectuals” in England
seem to have embarked on a course of
cultural colonialism; and are acquiring
the bad habit of asserting their superior-
ity not by deeds but by words. When
Mr Jacobson —himself a Commonwealth
writer —declares that “the literature of
England, the prestige of its universities,
its wealth, the sheer size and relative
sophistication of its reading public—
all these must continue to give it a hold
over the imagination of the writers of
the Commonwealth”, I must disagree
with him, certainly in relation to Austra-
lian writing. And I disagree not be-
cause I would wish to deny the literary
sophistication of England today, but
because 1 do not think that literary
activity in England at the moment has
much relevance for Australian writers.
Of course the best writers, whether Aus-
tralian or not, are aware of the literary
tradition they inherit; but it is a tradi-
tion which, as Eliot pointed put, be-
longs not to England but to Europe.
Patrick White has shown in his novels
an adventurousness and sheer energy of
imagination beside which the work of

most fashionable English novelists seems
tired and earth-bound. His is the work
of a man thoroughly versed in the
literary tradition to which he contri-
butes; and precisely because this is so,
he derives his standards not from the
demands of the English literary world
but from the infinitely more exacting
demands of the accumulated achieve-
ments of his predecessors.
So to suggest that it is to England
alone that Commonwealth writers will
look seems to me plainly to misunder-
stand the way a writer works. Are we
to suppose that our novelists and poets
are to fix their gaze steadily on English
literary fashions; that their “provincial-
ism” must aspire towards England's
“metropolitanism”? To answer yes to
this question is to replace one form of
provincialism with another. Mr Jacob-
son does not like the old colonial atti-
tudes, nor does he think one can make
large claims for the provinces—such as
Sydney—and regard them as “Athens-
like centres of culture”. I doubt whe-
ther one can make such a claim for any
place today without appearing both
uninformed and parochial.
What hope is there for us provincials?
Some time in the future, Mr Jacobson
suggests, Commonwealth writing might
have an effect on “the common language
and its literature”. Meantime we just go
plodding on. Our “process of articula-
tion and self-examination” has begun,
and we are permitted to chalk up to
our credit “The Story of an African
Farm'’, the novels of Chinua Achebe,
Patrick White and V. S. Naipaul. (Mr
Jacobson evidently is not a reader of
poetry.) But, alas, though the provinces
are not as isolated as they used to be,
the metropolis is more powerful, “im-
posing its expectations and distributing
its rewards"’; and this makes the emer-
gence of new cultures very difficult. So
Mr-Jacobson digs himself a nice deep
hole, from which, in his more intrepid
moments, he can steal an admiring
glance at his metropolitan literary
superiors. He sees himself as an “un-
invited guest'’, and hopes that the Eng-
lish literary world will be gracious
enough to keep a place for him (and all
us dreary provincials) where, “to their
mutual benefit and irritation, inexperi-
ence and judgment can hope to meet”.
Somehow I can’t see many of our wild
colonial boys queueing up for crumbs.
And I do not mean by this that they do
not need, or want, to extend their audi-
ences beyond Australia; or that they
have nothing to learn from and nothing
to give to England. But literary experi-
ence is not gained by hiring oneself out
in the service of a master whose foibles
and prejudices, though different, may
be as limiting as one’s own. Slessor saw
the writer of a new country correctly,
I believe. He is a navigator, sometimes
uncertain of his goals, and always of his
success, but stubbornly bent on explora-
tion. He may be guided and comforted
by the wisdom and experience of others
of all times and places; but he will not
find himself, or define his own capaci-
ties, by sailing with the wind.

Portrait of a Judge. Henry Cecil. Michael
Joseph. 20s.
Some time after the third world war,
when the white races of the world are
dying from radiation leukemia, is
apparently the setting of Miss Brooke-
Rose’s fifth novel. Apparently, because
there is no way of establishing anything
that might be objective reality. What
we read seem to be the observations,
perceptions, memories, fantasies of a
sick white man who is living in a settle-
ment in a world now dominated by the
Coloreds. The Coloreds are of all races,
possessing simply some skin color
pink, yellow, black. The others are
“Colorless” —and they are the second-
class citizens, unemployed because con-
sidered unreliable, and because of the
sickness that seems to have affected only
them. They are unemployed, too, be-
cause of the massive population increase
that has occurred, and that is con-
tinuing unchecked.
The sick man turns over continually
the same thoughts, the same fantasies,
the same phrases; he is trying, or has
tried, or may try, to get a job as odd
job man at the house of the important
Mrs Mgulu; he creates, or re-creates,
sexual encounters with Mrs Ned, as he
lies there and his wife brings, or pre-
pares to bring, or has brought him,
gruel—all that is available in the food
shortage, or perhaps all he can eat in
his sickness. Mrs Ned is a Colorless
and like them all is known simply by
the diminutive of her husband's name.
The name of the sick man, though, is
never certain. And each time he goes—
or imagines he goes to a labor ex-
change where there is no work he
is always asked his previous occupation
which he either cannot remember or
will not disclose.
Miss Brooke-Rose has taken some
obvious “social” themes—color discrimi-
nation, the bomb, the population expan-
sion; but she has treated them not with
the direct concern of the documentary
novelist but elusively, brilliantly, in a
manner derivative from and fit to stand
by the French nouvelle roman. She is
one of those few English writers ever
to have bothered to read Continental
literature—and to learn and gain from
it. The concerns of the novel are
obvious enough—the irresponsibility of
the West leading to its eventual destruc-
tion; the disregard of human identity
produced by color discrimination. But
Miss Brooke-Rose has produced a fas-
cinating work of art, not a didactic or
even committed work; her writing has
the skill and care of brilliance; she
knows just when to bring back the re-
peated phrase, knows just which permu-
tation to offer of the obsessive ideas
that run through the man’s uncensored,
unrestricted mind—and she produces
not only a representation of mental sick-
ness and guilty obsession but the formal
beauty of word and rhythm. The man
is a man of imagination. Though the
product of a dying man's mind, the
novel is full of color and event. When
the events took place is never certain,
and the colors of the lawns and mimo-
sas, and faces he considers, are liable to
change. Conversations occur —wittily,
sadly—and are repeated, slightly
changed so that the man can have
another try, so that he can re-create the
situation—which may have vet to occur
—to his better advantage. Miss Brooke-
Rose has written a very fine book.
Gabriel Okara is a Nigerian poet,
some of whose work is in the Penguin
“Modern Poems from Africa”. “The
Voice”, his first novel, is also as far
from the usual English novel as Miss
Brooke-Rose’s; and his innovations, too,
are strikingly effective. The language
is a curiosity, a beautiful and grand
curiosity, English accommodating itself
to African inversions and intonations.
“The engine canoe against the strong
water pushed and slowly, slowly it
walked along the wide river with the tall
iroko trees, kapok trees, palm trees,
standing on its banks, the sky's eye
reaching. Soon, the day’s eye became
bad.” And this never becomes coy or
effete. As with Miss Brooke-Rose’s
method and language, no other could be
imagined for the novel.
Okolo has returned to his village,
somewhere in post-colonial Africa. The
leader of the village and his advisers
are corrupt. “We are in a democracy
and everyone has the right to express
any opinion. But we have.to think what
our leader has done for us.” Okolo
goes round asking questions, looking for
“it”. “It” is never defined, but seems
to be a sense of honesty and purpose
in public life, integrity and decency in
the individual. Okolo’s questions are
disturbing, and he is forced to leave his
village. He travels to a big town and
meets only corruption and prejudice.

On the canoe voyage a girl shelters
from a rain-storm beneath his coat, re-
moving her soaked blouse; her future
mother-in-law accuses Okolo of touch-
ing the girl. In the city the anonymous
Big One, who has everything under con-
trol, threatens by whispered messages
to have Okolo put in a mental hospital.
He meets a European civil servant, em-
ployed, it seems, by the new govern-
ment. “I see you are one of those
smart alecs’, the white man said petu-
lantly as he got up from his chair. ‘You
wait until we move out and see what
will happen to men like you’.” Touches
like this show firmly the political astute-
ness, the fine social observation of
Okara. And these touches of the con-
temporary political world add to the
misty atmosphere of threat and suspi-
cion through which the fable is guided.
A sort of West African Kafka here,
Okara is concerned both with political
corruption and dictatorship, and with
the problem of personal integrity. His
method is that of the fable, the speech
rhythms, the strange prose, supporting
the impression of a simple, timeless,
almost mythic story; and the whole thing
is managed with assured skill and eco-
nomy, achieving in a minor way per-
fection.
Henry Cecil is a prolific producer of
thrillers and law stories. “Portrait of a
Judge” is a collection of 22 stories —the
sort of anecdotes, I suppose, that club
men tell each other in the depths of the
leather and horsehair of Edwardian
London. They have twist endings and
surprises, and Dame Edith Sitwell has
an introductory note recording one’s
pleasure in reading Mr Cecil. “His
prose and his invention run as quickly
as a hare,” she says. The only hares
I can remember used to run madly
round in circles and then flop down.
He doesn’t arouse the beagle in me.

Gentle Humanitarian
Harry Holland: Militant Socialist. P. J.
O’Farrell. Australian National University
Press. 495. 6d.
Harry Holland? Who in modern Austra-
lian politics remembers the bloodthirsty
ogre Harry Holland, the man born be-
fore his time that is before the rise
of the Australian Communist Party
in the unlikely town of Queanbeyan
where he married the twenty-year-old
daughter of a superintendent of the
Campbell estate of Duntroon?
In his early years he belonged to the
same category as those groping and unco-
ordinated socialist amateurs William
Morris Hughes and William Arthur Hol-
man, but their paths soon diverged.
Hughes and Holman among their jumb-
led mass of reading came across the
salutary proverb, “Softlee, softlee catchee
monkey” and went in pursuit of the ape
of capitalism along the path of com-
promise and reform. As ever in Labor
history, the monkey caught them and
caged them.
Harry, however, took a much longer
time to be caught. He was a man of
principle, one principle which dictated
that the capitalist was the foul root of all
evil. Poor Mrs Holland so loved her
gentle humanitarian lord that she had
eight little pledges of her affection to
rear by the time she was thirty-odd, at a
stage at which she scarcely knew what
a pay envelope looked like. It is true
that Harry had a “salary” from the
journals that employed him, but his
socialist employers in practice regarded
“salaries” as a dirty word. Some of them
and his political congeners, who included
the IWW, the nihilists, anarchists and .
promoters of the One Big Union, dis-
liked and feared him even more than
the capitalists. One of them spoke of him
as airing, with a “curst licentiousness of
tongue”, his “inordinate self-love in con-
junction with the censorial illusion that
he is the dictator of the universe”. People
who went on in that way were apt to
land associates as well as themselves in
gaol, under governments like the brutal
administration of Gregory Wade of New
South Wales. Harry in 1908 advised the
Broken Hill miners, who were striking
under the gentle tutelage of Tom Mann,
to “get ready to take the mines and hold
them”, even if the process called for an
armed conflict with “Wade’s police
army”, in which “machine-guns rattle
and red blood flows”. “Put a little ginger
into it,” he advised them, “or, to be plain
spoken . . . dynamite.” He was surprised
and annoyed when the courts of the ex-
ploiters put him into prison for two
years and even more annoyed when they
let him out of a well-fed martyrdom, al-
most at once. However, even if his re-
lease offended his vanity, it opened the
way to a satisfying participation in the
1909-10 coal strike.
It was not long after that, that Harry
discovered New Zealand, whose mili-
tants were willing to give him a holiday
to cure a lame leg. There he found a
land of opportunity. It took him only
two years to achieve the accolade of a
new gaol sentence from Chief Justice Sir
Robert Stout.
Experience with the New Zealand
“Worker”, an original journal which ac-
tually paid wages, put a little stability
under his economic feet and soon he,
lagging somewhat behind his old com-
rades Hughes and Holman, set out in
pursuit of the monkey with a seat in
Parliament. Mr O’Farrell writes: “The
Holland of 1918 was not the Holland
who had come to New Zealand in 1912.
Unity with moderates and political in-
volvements had wrought changes.”
One observer who met him in the
early post-World War I years, indeed,
thought him like Lenin. I thought him,
when I met him during a brief visit to
Australia at the beginning of 1926, when
he had reached the stage of leadership
of the Opposition, more like the old lion
on the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film-titles.
He roared horribly but when he opened
his mouth you saw at once they had
taken out all his front teeth including
the incisors. By 1930 he was unveiling
statues to W. F. Massey against whom,
less than two decades earlier, he had
been urging police and naval units to
rebel, and describing his erstwhile enemy
as a “great statesman, a man who kept
his word”. By the time he collapsed at
the funeral of a Maori king, Te Rata
Mahuta, in October, 1933, aged 66, the
monkey had him in its grip securely and
he was looking forward to the Prime
Ministership at the next election.
He had had very little from life, either
satisfaction or practical achievement of
his aims, or even more than bare sub-
sistence. Behind the outward seeming of
savage hate and advocacy of violent
revolutionary action, he was affectionate,
personally kindly. His domestic life was
a long love story and the only thing that
gave him continuing pleasure and satis-
faction.
Mr O’Farrell’s well-documented and
annotated volume is a biography well
above the normal Australian university
standard. The ghosts of Harry Holland’s
more eminent early co-hunters of the
capitalists’ system will read this book
with some envy.

Are you
being left behind
technically?
Never in industrial history has there been a
time of such rapid technological change as
today. Those who put new technology to work
strengthen their competitive edge; those who
do not, get left by the wayside.
If arc welding plays an important part in
your manufacturing and production, are you
sure you are really up to date on the new and
more productive techniques that can lower
your costs?
There is one way to be sure; it is to get to
know Lincoln Electric.
As manufacturers of Australia’s largest range
of arc welding electrodes and machines, it is
our business to know about latest welding
technology here and overseas.
As specialists in arc welding we believe it is
our business to be more than a mere supplier
of welding machines and electrodes; that we
should help our customers know about and
put to gainful use latest welding techniques.
Are you getting this sort of help, from your
supplier, or are you merely getting welding
equipment and electrodes as ordered?
With welding technology advancing so rapidly
you should have this kind of help. You are
already paying for it why not have it?

This is an unusual geography book; you
will not only find much about rivers,
capes, climates and topography of the
series of peninsulas and islands which
lie to the east of the Indian sub-conti-

a detailed and most interesting discus-
sion of the social, economic and political
set-up of South-East Asia.
The final chapter on South-East Asia
and the World, surveying the changing
relationships of our eight near north

world, finishes with the following senti-
ment: “For, aside from all considerations

Under the massed and moving clouds
with the moon
emerging, I mount by the mountain
road and look
through forests’ fringing hair on the

The mother-earth lies there pared of her

The township's insolent gems glitter in
her groin;
the roadway’s rubies burn, rove round

My way is bathed in light, barred with
branches;
leaves are burnished; boughs creak; the
under-brush
rustles with furred bodies. The way
glooms over.
Starless stands of trees, not to be stared
through,
close, cavernous, over me. I am found
out by fears,
changed to a child challenged by goose-
flesh terrors.
What if a Grendel-shape grew from out
of the gloom?
I am empty-handed. Can I rip from the
road a rock,
hold in haste a hand-hatchet? It is a
madness,
a mood of the mind on this mountain

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
More Pressure on Britain
The extension until May of the
3,000 million dollar special
central bank credits made to
Britain last November was in line
with expectations. Not so obvious
was the behind-the-scenes consulta-
tions of the central bank boys who
had provided the stop-gap. If they
see that Britain is making progress
towards solving her difficulties, they
evidently will not act precipitately.
They know that withdrawal of support
not only could force a devaluation
but a flight of foreign funds.
Yet there is nothing to imply that
they gave three hearty cheers when
they learned of Britain’s £stg34m.
trade deficit in January. A calculated
guess suggests that the central banks
were not satisfied with the progress
made. Hence the warning to the
Wilson Government from the Gover-
nor of the Bank of England that
spending must be cut.
Each central banker undoubtedly
encounters political pressure from his
own counrty, where each government
is chafing at Britain’s 15 p.c. sur-
charge on imports. On the surface,
most Europeans want the crisis over,
the UK surcharge removed, and
everything back to normal. They are
beginning to learn that a forced with-
drawal of support for sterling could
have a chain reaction. They have
become more conscious of this since
America placed curbs on overseas
spending.
It will be difficult to get back to
“normal”, because the liquidity prob-
lem is now chronic. France’s Finance
Minister, M. Giscard d’Estaing, has
outlined a deflationary policy which
avoids an increase in the price of gold,
but insists that settlement of deficits
should be in gold only.
France’s earlier demand, that all
leading currencies should be convert-
ible to gold, is still retained. The
example has since been followed to
some degree by Spain, which was re-
ported to have converted 100 million
dollars to gold early in February.
A concession—if it can be called
that is that certain deficits of a
“fundamental” nature may be settled
in part by credit facilities, so long as
they follow the strict lines of the
Bretton Woods agreement and
arrangements with the International
Monetary Fund. This is taken to
exclude the swapping of credits under
the Basle arrangements or other ex-
pediencies such as “Roosa” bonds.
France’s proposed financial policy
also asserts that central banks should
not be permitted to hold reserves in
national currencies and should pro-
gressively eliminate the existing
foreign exchange balances.
HAROLD WILSON
Having set down this policy, which
acknowledges world liquidity short-
ages and attempts to tie deficit settle-
ments to an exchange of gold, France
maintains that if holdings of foreign
exchange balances are eliminated
from a nation’s reserves, then that
nation may create additional reserves
which would be linked to gold and
which would be the only other assets
that central banks would be permitted
to hold.
It’s a good trick if you can do it.
But it would create great hardship for
gold-poor nations to follow this lead.
None of this helps the fears of
Europeans who continue to speculate
in gold as a hedge against the possible
devaluation of sterling.
At this stage it appears that Britain
has not been forced to draw heavily
on the stand-by credits advanced by
American and European central
bankers, yet it still remains to be
proved if Britain can recoup earlier
losses. Evidently the recent central
bankers’ meeting was not impressed
on this score.
Trend to Dearer Money
HFhe shortfall of £2O million in the
■*" last Commonwealth loan, although
a disappointment, is not such a set-
back as to cause the Government im-
mediately to increase taxes. After all,
the golden goose of loan-raisings has
been a wonderful provider in recent
years and a £2O million shortfall usual-
ly can be raised in two bites on the
overseas markets of London and New
York.
Unfortunately, because of the pre-
vailing high interest rates and the US
interest equalisation tax, the Com-
monwealth Government has shied
away from overseas borrowings. But
there are alternative sources in Europe
and, if overseas defence purchases are
going to be heavy, some package deal
on loans is possible.
On the domestic front, a shortfall in
loan moneys usually reflects a tighter
liquidity situation. It also is a pointer
to the April loan, which falls in a
period of difficult money-raising with
the company tax payments season in
full swing. A close analysis of the
content of recent loan raisings,
however, indicates that the shortfall
was attributable to the lack of support
for the short-term securities, influen-
ced almost entirely by short-term
money market dealers who had been
caught previously by capital losses
when the interest rate was raised on
short-term bonds.
These money market dealers are
captive supporters and, although they
may be subscribing to Treasury notes

as an alternative, they are still provid-
ing funds for the Government. Their
temporary withdrawal could force a
rise in the short-term rate, yet they
must continue to buy Government se-
curities as part of their operation,
either short-term bonds or Treasury
notes.
The Treasury, forced to go for big
amounts to cover its defence commit-
ments, now must consider a slightly
higher interest return for bond sub-
scribers. This, of course, sets a pattern
of dearer money throughout the
nation’s financial structure. Certainly
it is a brake on inflation. If it is allied
to higher taxation, industry will be
forced to carry a much heavier burden,
with consequent reductions in profit
margins.
Stamp Duty Net
Interstate companies which hadn’t
A given much thought to the Vic-
torian Stamp Duties Act are discover-
ing that the net is far-reaching. Appli-
cations for new share issues in Vic-
toria, where signed under seal, are be-
ing treated as a “deed” and therefore
require stamp duty of 30s.
Companies which have applied for
a new issue of shares in Victoria
usually receive a polite letter from
harassed share registry managers,
stating that if the applicant wishes to
remedy the omission and validate the
application it will be necessary to for-
ward a cheque for 30s.
Not only does all this create extra
paper work and administrative
charges, but it is causing irritation
and confusion among those who sold
their shares before the issue. For
example, one company which sold its
shares in Woodside Oil prior to the
issue was asked by a broker to fill out
the application, as the buyer wasn’t
registered in time to qualify for the
issue.
Now the company finds it is being
stung for 30s.'on shares for which it
is applying on someone else’s behalf
(who wouldn’t be required to pay
stamp duty anyway).
Emancipating the Banks
Anyone expecting the Australian
trading banks to make the inter-
national banking summer school in
Melbourne in the last fortnight a forum
to expound their case for bearing less
of the burdens of monetary policy will
have been disappointed. Mr N. A.
Jackson, general manager of the CBA,
talking on the sources and deploy-
ment of bank funds, made the mildest
of protests about the straitjacket
of official controls on their activities,
saying merely that “the tasks of banks
in managing the funds available to
them is not made any easier by the
need to adhere to official controls,
especially when, in addition, they are
subject to restrictions limiting the
rates of interest they may charge on
their loans, while other institutions are
quite free from such restrictions.” This
is merely stating the disability.
It was left to Dr R. F. Henderson to
offer tangible ways by which emanci-
pation could effectively be achieved
for the banks. His formula involved
more scope being given to the banks
to extend their own direct lending
business in straight competition with
other financial institutions and that to
this end they be permitted to adopt
a more varied system of charges and
payments for deposits to meet outside
competition. Both these could be done,
he said, without weakening the neces-
sary control of the Central Bank.
In short, he wants to see a new
interpretation given to flexible interest
policy. This would involve allowing
the banks to charge higher rates on
advances so that less substantial firms
could avoid recourse to funds from
outside finance companies at even
higher rates of interest. By the same
token Dr Henderson wants to allow
the banks to charge much lower rates
to the more substantial borrowers to
turn them from borrowing cheaper
elsewhere, say in the inter-company
market.
In other words, as he stated, “If the
trading banks were to widen the range
of their lending rates it would be more
difficult for commercial bill finance
to be provided as cheaply as bank
credit. It is the narrow range of over-
draft rates that stimulates the large
borrower of first-class credit rating to
try to get cheaper credit by some other
means, whether this be inter-company
borrowing or issuing a commercial
bill.”


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Wanted: A “Geddes Axe”
The forthcoming Federal-State finance talks
TI/hen the Victorian Premier put up
his State income tax kite last year
it was not this year’s Budget he was
thinking of but rather next year’s, when
the tax would have been first imposed.
Mr Bolte, having been knocked back
on State income tax and leaped his
Budget gap this year by milking to
the tune of resounding political jeers
most of the available residues of revenue
in other State fields in raising charges
and levies of one sort and another, will
go to Canberra next month more deter-
mined than ever to increase Victoria’s
share of Commonwealth handouts.
What is more, he will be looking for
extra money on a more permanent basis
than the State’s full £5.1 million share
of the Federal Government’s £2O million
special assistance grants he threw into
his consolidated revenue to rescue his
Budget last year but which, sadly, were
not there to save the day a second time
in the current one.
The occasion will be, of course, mainly
one of hammering out a replacement for
the State Grants agreement which, after
a six years’ run, expires on June 30 next.
With Bolte in sight of a financial impasse
in the coming year, a showdown on the
whole field of Commonwealth finance
for the States might be expected, per-
haps even a direct challenge on uniform
taxation itself.
Whatever paths the talks follow, it
seems high time the intricate interweave
of finance payments to the States was
sorted out and rationalised into a pattern
the electorate could understand. Like
Topsy, it has grown up in piecemeal
fashion by fits and starts and now re-
sembles a patchwork quilt stitched by an
absent-minded spinster.
About £790 million will flow from
Commonwealth to States by four general
routes this financial year. The biggest
amount will be by way of what is
ambiguously termed financial assistance
grants, to the tune of £340 million;
ambiguous, because this is largely tax
reimbursements plus £l6 million for
the two claimant States, Tasmania and
WA. The next biggest is for Common-
wealth assistance for States’ works and
housing, again a misnomer because most
of it is provided from loans raised in
the States themselves.
By a third route there are payments
for specific purposes of a capital nature,
mainly for roads, railway, university and
other building. These take £107.6
million this year. Lastly, the States get
specific payments for revenue purposes,
£35.4 million, of which the three biggest
items are universities, tuberculosis hos-
pitals and the Commonwealth’s contri-
butions under the 1927 Financial Agree-
ment for interest and sinking fund pay-
ments on State debts. Regrettably for
Mr Bolte, so far this year nothing has
been forthcoming along a fifth route,
additional assistance grants, which aver-
aged out at about £l6 million a year
for the States from 1961 to 1964.
It is obvious from this breakdown that
the premiers will concentrate their efforts
H. E. BOLTE
at the forthcoming talks on the first and
biggest item on the list. The carve-up
of loan money is a separate exertion to
come later. Specific payments for capital
purposes are not very amenable to
premiers’ persuasion. Anyway, the
main item, roads, has already been
thrashed out and the die cast for the
next four years.
As for specific payments for revenue
purposes, these are a sort of Common-
wealth prerogative. Every managing
director has his quirks and doesn’t like
to be pushed into things, even if amen-
able to suggestion. As we are without
a national disaster at the moment and
the unemployed are few and far be-
tween, additional assistance grants look
out of the question, the more so since
defence is claiming more and more
Commonwealth funds.
Future defence commitments, in fact,
look like being the main obstacle in
front of the premiers next month in any
battle they may join to get a more pro-
gressive tax reimbursement formula.
Last time (in March, 1959), the question
of revision came up, the Commonwealth
itself put forward proposals and these
were accepted at the subsequent
Premiers’ Conference the following June.
These forestalled the premiers’ dis-
satisfaction with the old formula on
which the total reimbursement was
calculated (this was by adjusting the
1946 reimbursement of £45 million for
variations in the total population and
percentage increases in average wages).
The division of the total among the
States under that formula was on a
variable basis from year to year, but in
1958-59 it was done in proportion to
each State’s population adjusted for
density and for numbers of children be-
tween the ages of 5 and 15.
The formula agreed in 1959, and
which now comes up for revision, was
intended to dispense with ad hoc special
grants, yet in three of the intervening
years additional assistance grants (in all,
£47 million) were made to the States!
Although none is to be made this year,
it is clear that the pressures from the
States (at least one State) for another
revision of the formula is as strong as
ever, even if for different reasons than
made it encumbent on the Common-
wealth to make the special grants in
1961-62, 1962-63 and in 1963-64.
The formula applied from 1959 to this
year set as its base year (1959-60) a
total reimbursement of £242.5 million,
which was comparable with the previous
year s £225.75 million inclusive of
supplementary and special grants, so it
was a generous starting point. In the
first year (1959-60), the former method
of distributing it among the States, that
is on an adjusted population basis, was
unchanged. For the subsequent years
the grant for each State was adjusted in
accordance with a formula based on
movements in the State’s population and
for the so-called “betterment factor”*
that is 1.1 times the percentage increase,
if any, in average wages in Australia as
a whole in the preceding year. (In the
1948 to 1959 period the betterment
factor was 1.0 times average wage in-
creases.)
In other words, instead of the total
reimbursement being calculated by one
formula and then distributed between the
States under another formula, in the new
arrangement the total reimbursement
would be the aggregate of six separate
amounts which would be calculated by
applying the new formula to the in-
dividual State reimbursements of the
previous year.
It certainly took us a long time to

arrive at this sensible arrangement. It
would be difficult to improve on it, but
doubtless the premiers will have some
ideas on how to do so. Two possibilities
will probably occur to them. For in-
stance, they could go for another lift
in the basic amount of the reimburse-
ment. This, in view of the present
method of calculating the total re-
imbursement, would have now to be
done on a State by State basis. So this
could result not only in a straight-out
bargaining match with the Common-
wealth, but also in a dog fight among
the States themselves if any of them
stuck out for a bigger percentage in-
crease than the others. Secondly, they
could try to get a bigger percentage
increase in the wage or “betterment”
element of the adjusting factor. Last
time this was lifted by 10 p.c. It would
be worth a try, though, as I say, the
Commonwealth’s defence commitments
will loom large in any decisions.
Broadly speaking, the States are not
likely to find in the talks a panacea
for their finance problems. It is all very
well for them to set high ceilings for
expenditure. If they expect the Federal
Government to foot most of the bills,
they have ultimately to realise that its
resources are not unlimited and also
that a national order of spending
priorities has to be preserved.
Given such priorities however
rudely drawn and given the overall
design of Federation, while it is open
to all States to scrape their own barrels
for money within the defined limits of
the revenue-raising fields reserved to
them, there is no short cut across the
agreed dichotomy of Commonwealth
and State fields that any one of them
can take unilaterally.
Usually when a State, like Victoria
this year, finds itself in a tight financial
corner and gropes for unorthodox ex-
pedients, at least some of its troubles
are of its own making. For instance, it
may have pitched its spending targets
too high or may simply have failed to
have searched its spending sheets to cut
back in less essential directions. In-
dividuals and corporations cannot afford
these luxuries. Governments, however,
tend to think that commercial rules
don't apply to them, that more money
will come from somewhere to get them
out of a spot without need on their part
to economise.
Enough is known of the steady tread
and time-consuming pace of govern-
ment departments here to feel confident
that millions could be saved and not
a few of the financial difficulties of State
governments solved if a “Geddes Axe”
got to work in their departments. This is
to say nothing of the Federal sphere,
which would certainly have more of the
taxation it collects from the States to
hand back to them in reimbursements if
an axe was put to work in the depart-
ments there as well.
CROESUS
Sir lan on Capital Inflow
A highlight of the Banking School
npALKiNG to the general subject of the
A role of the hanks in rapidly expand-
ing economies several of the speakers at
the International Banking Summer
School in Melbourne in the last fort-
night managed to get to close grips with
some of the controversial economic
issues confronting Australia.
For instance, on the question of
capital inflow, Sir lan Potter thoroughly
debunked the notion entertained by his
fellow Melbourne broker Mr Staniforth
Ricketson and Labor Leader Mr Cal-
well that legislation is the answer to its
control.
It was not that Sir lan saw overseas
capital as an unmitigated blessing, or
that it shouldn't be canalised into
appropriate channels. On the contrary,
he spent much of his time exploring
both its advantages and disadvantages,
suggesting guide lines for it to be better
directed towards serving Australia’s best
interests.
There’s no need to dwell on the ad-
vantages —the immediate gains for over-
seas reserves, the better utilisation of
local savings, the secondary stimulation
to the economy when resources are not
fully employed, the acquisition of skills
and techniques, the stimulation of
locally-owned ancillary activities to the
operations of large international groups,
its uplifting effect on national income,
and so on.
Some of these and others advanced by
Senator Gorton at the Stock Exchange
symposium may be arguable. Sir lan
was quite frank about this. He was more
concerned to show that the dis-
advantages, such as the four mentioned
below, were not unmanageable and that
“the advantages have far outweighed the
cost'’. His view was that “since there
are some longer-term disadvantages in
overseas capital, it would be as well to
endeavor to avoid them in the future
through a more discriminatory approach
this does not imply the use of legis-
lation or taxation to dampen down over-

seas investment but to give encourage-
ment to invest in areas where it can pro-
vide the maximum national benefit,
avoiding redundancy and conforming to
the overall requirements of Australia’s
national growth.”
One particular field most appropriate
for overseas capital was, in Sir lan’s
view, minerals development. This was
also supported by Mr C. W. M. Court,
the West Australian Minister for In-
dustrial Development, Railways and the
North-West, in another address to the
School. In this he made a strong point
of the contribution being made not only
to minerals but also to
the establishment of essential public
services by the increasing number of
joint Australian-overseas owned com-
panies developing the minerals resources
of Western Australia. Sir lan himself
underlined the point that since the ex-
ploitation of basic resources is involved
in minerals development it is most
desirable that local capital should par-
ticipate (this is the case with all four
of the big groups entering iron ore
development in WA in the last iew
years).
In the same line, Sir Maurice Maw-
by told the symposium that the use of
“very large amounts” of overseas capi-
tal in minerals development was “in-
escapable if any development at all is
to be started.”
Speaking more generally, Sir lan
wanted to see overseas capital going
into long-term investment “to generate
exports and to enable substitution of
imports”, because such investment will
contribute directly to its own service in
terms of the balance of payments.
It may have been all right in the past,
but he doesn’t want overseas capital go-
ing into industries catering only for the
local market. Equally he doesn't want
overseas capital coming here for specu-
lative purposes “unless the risks of the
speculation fall on the shoulders of the
overseas investor.” Also he thinks it un-
desirable to use foreign capital for the
tertiary industries “unless it takes the
form of direct equity investment.”
As to methods of compulsion or per-
suasion to get overseas capital into the
most appropriate uses, Sir lan boggled
at compulsory legislation in any form,
unless a country had reached a stage
where capital imports could be regarded
“quite objectively”, which didn't fit our
position. Yet, canvassing the alternative,
he said that “At the extreme it would
be impracticable to legislate to prohibit
overseas investment except on the most
onerous and unattractive terms. The in-
strument of taxation discriminating
against the overseas investor is another
method that may have discouraging
effects, while a straightforward state-
ment of policy discouraging capital im-
ports may have an inhibiting effect even
if not supported by legislation.”
Turning his back on these, Sir lan
plumped for an ad hoc qualitative
approach rather on the lines of present
policy, but more positive. He examined
how this .might work more effectively to
modify four main problems arising from
capital imports. These were the in-
flationary effects, the failure to stimu-
late exports, overseas control, and
monopolisation and balance of payments
difficulties.
On the first, inflation, he thought the
monetary authorities should keep a close
watch on the quantity of capital im-
ports, so as to put any additional re-
straint on credit required to contain ex-
pansion to an extent compatible with
available resources. “Experience in Aus-
tralia has shown that such a policy can
gain effective results in a relatively short
time,” he stated. Further, the inflation-
ary effect could be mitigated by “direct-
ing capital imports as far as possible
towards eliminating bottlenecks in pro-
duction and generally saving on produc-
tion costs.”
As for directing more capital imports
into export production, Sir lan believes
that “a great deal can be done in the
early stages of negotiations between
Government and those in overseas cor-
porations making the investment; that
is to arrange for a certain proportion
of the production to be exported, and
for the overseas corporation to take the
responsibility of finding markets for
such exports.” On top of this, export
benefits and subsidies should be widened
“as in the case of the United King-
dom” (sic.).
Sir lan differed from Professor
Wheelright by underplaying the signi-
ficance of overseas control of Australian
industry. He believed it would cost
£4OO-£5OO million to acquire a 40 per
cent interest in overseas subsidiaries
operating here and thought this was
ruled out for balance of payments rea-
sons. So he wouldn't go along with any
compulsory requirement to get local
participation. “It can have very limited
use, certainly as far as established in-
dustries are concerned.”
However, he said, much better scope
is offered for local participation in new
investment, “even without legislative
enactment”, largely at the negotiating
stage between the overseas interests and
Australian government authorities or
financial institutions, when at the very
least moral suasion can be applied and
assistance, if necessary, withheld.


Bright Ideas on Investment
Views from Melbourne’s symposium
at the tail end of a fortnight
of many notable papers delivered at
the International Banking Summer
School, the Stock Exchange of Mel-
bourne’s symposium on Investment in
Australia last week ran the danger of
being somewhat of an anti-climax. It
is testimony to the quality of the speak-
ers and what they had to say in the three
tightly packed days that the discussion
was kept at a lively pitch to the end.
Befitting Britain’s place as Australia’s
biggest and oldest source of overseas
capital, appropriately the ball was open-
ed by a Londoner, Mr M. Shanks. It
was coincidental that he was also a
journalist, economic correspondent to
the “Sunday Times” and an adviser to
the new Labor Government.
Although Mr Shanks finished with a
strong avowal of faith in Anglo-Austra-
lian partnership, he had a number of
obstacles to jump in getting there. As
Professor Cochrane noted in the discus-
sion, he knocked quite a few and seem-
ed to crash at one. Of course it was
awkward for Mr Shanks to have to
speak against the background of Bri-
tain’s shaky economic position and the
current tightrope performance of ster-
ling. This made any forecasts of the
possible future flow of capital from Bri-
tain to Australia extremely hazardous
and this hurdle was surmounted rather
clumsily.
Mr Shanks rather dismayed his audi-
ence by saying that “as of now the
opportunities for profitable exporting out
of Australia may be less than appears at
first sight”, and that “we had to face
the fact that Australian enterprises are
pretty high cost, largely because of the
limited size of the market and that many
of them would therefore have quite a
job competing against bigger operations
in Britain and America”.
But Professor Cochrane of Monash
University came back at him strongly
to say that restrictions on export
franchises were holding up our export
expansion in manufactured goods and
that their prejudicial effect might well
outweigh the benefits of foreign invest-
ment here. If persisted in, the restric-
tions are likely to make the balance of
payments difficulties inherent in foreign
investment intractable much sooner than
otherwise.
Cochrane considered that the fran-
chise situation called for some drastic
action. He thinks “The Department of
Trade and Industry should continue its
investigations into the extent and nature
of these agreements, and every effort
should be made to encourage the aban-
donment of the agreements. While the
department might well fear that disclo-
sure of information makes it difficult for
them to gain the confidence of com-
panies, I am inclined to think there
comes a time when frank announce-
ment of the true situation is both use-
ful and necessary.
“With the anti-restrictive practices
legislation in mind, I can’t help won-
dering whether registration of such
agreements might not also be a useful
step, and if this is done a special body
might be established to consider them.
Finally, and I hope this step need never
be necessary, it would be possible for
the Reserve Bank, on the advice of this
special body, to limit the repatriation
of profits of those companies which con-
tinue to ignore all appeals to remove
the restrictions.”
Inevitably, after the tortuous experi-
ences of some speculative companies and
the investors whose money evaporated
as a consequence of them over the last
four years, the symposium had to enter-
tain a few coroners. Perhaps with some
of the principals of fallen empires at-
tending courts around the corner from
the Southern Cross Hotel to explain
away their misfortunes, it was just as
well not to forget them. Moreover, only
a couple of days before the symposium,
receivers took up the reins in another
development group, Savoy Corporation,
so these sort of trials are still with us,
despite everything.
npALKiNG to the subject of trends in com-
pany finance, Sir Alexander Fitz-
gerald, who has been an open critic of
recent legislation to strengthen some
part of the Companies Acts, again plead-
ed that, to control the activities of a
relatively few reckless “or even un-
scrupulous” financiers, we may have
gone too far in imposing onerous restric-
tions on legitimate company direction
and control. Even so, there was that
awful new example of Savoy.
In another paper, the Victorian
Attorney-General, Mr A. G. Rylah, had
something to say in defence of his recent
attitudes prompting tightening of the
Companies Act in his State. He admitted
that the companies legislation has gone
almost as far as is possible to go in the
direction of acquiring information to be
put before prospective investors and
members of companies. This does not
mean that all companies provide ade-
quate information for the investing pub-
lic, but improvements in this regard are
not so much a matter for more law as
a matter for improved standards in ac-
counting practice (for Sir Alex’s benefit?)
and a recognition by all concerned with
the operation of companies that the in-
vesting public is entitled to be given a
true and fair view of the position of the
company at frequent intervals.
Then, turning to the business world,
he accused it of having a deep-seated
love of secrecy. In his view the need
for secrecy is vastly over-rated. “Too
often the failure to make adequate dis-
closure springs from a desire to pro-
tect the interests of directors and man-
agement rather than the interests of the
company. Public companies depend
upon public support for their growth and
success, and the investing public is in my
view entitled to information about the
company’s position. It must be remem-
bered that much of the length and com-
plexity of company law springs directly
from the fact that the business world is
unwilling to give adequate information
to the investing public unless forced to
do so.”
Mr Rylah went on to run the rule
over the responsibilities of directors in
a fashion leaving no doubt that, in his
view, a great number were not living up
to them in the Australian business com-
munity and also that multiple director-
ships were often a menace to the com-
panies concerned. “The incompetent
director is no more dangerous than the
over-busy director”, may, however, have
been a rather negative way of putting
it. At any rate Mr Rylah evidently
wants to see the euthanasia of the part-
time director if he is not prepared to
give the necessary time to the supervi-
sion of the affairs of the company and
accept full responsibility for the major
policy decisions affecting the members,
and in many cases the creditors and
general public.
For investors who have lost their
money in ill-fated investments, Sir Alex-
ander Fitzgerald’s message was in future
to realise that high risks are implicit in
high interest rates, that the best
safeguard for an investor is the experi-
ence, ability and conscientiousness of
the persons to whom his savings have
been entrusted. Equally, attempts to
control borrowings by a company on the
basis of balance sheet ratios are, in his
view, likely to prove futile, even danger-
ous, for the simple reason that a balance
sheet is not intended to. be a statement
of realisable value.
All this may be true, said Mr C. R.
Darvell, general manager of the ANZ
Bank, but it should be remembered that
in boom times an investment fever builds
up. In the heady atmosphere investors
very often refuse to be protected against
themselves, not listening to sound advice
as to where and when to place their
funds.
Mr Darvell raised a lot of other points
on the provision of funds for companies

and didn't forget to throw in a plug for
liberalising the activities of the trading
banks. He produced a very telling table
showing how the banks’ percentage in-
crease in their outstanding loans had
fallen way behind other major lenders.
This showed that over ten years (rough-
ly up to 1962) the cheque-paying banks’
loans had risen only 33 p.c. as against
200 p.c. for lendings by non-retail
finance businesses.
Nor did he spare the punch lines. He
said that “the growth and importance of
other sources of finance compared with
the trading banks has been very closely
(sic) related to the use of the banking
system by our monetary authorities as
one of the major instruments in
administering monetary policy . . . and
it now seems to be clearly emerging that
it would be in the interests of the eco-
nomy to find means to bring the bank-
ing system back to a greater position of
importance in mustering the funds
needed for capital provision in our
rapidly developing economy”.
Neither the papers nor the discussion
on capital inflow at the symposium
seemed to measure up to the quality of
Sir lan Potter’s excellent survey of the
subject at the banking summer school
earlier in the week (see “Croesus”, page
56). Two Cabinet Ministers, Mr
McEwen and Senator Gorton, spelled out
the Federal Government's motives in
welcoming overseas investment and they
wisely refrained from airing any reser-
vations they may have about its unre-
stricted entry. “I am known to have
pretty definite views on the question of
foreign investment,” Mr McEwen said,
“but this is not the occasion to air
them—it is enough for me to say ‘we
must borrow but we should not sell
out’.”
The occasion didn't deter Mr J. S.
Wilson, managing director of APM,
whose criticisms were baldly uninhibited,
to say the. least. The Bulletin
pointed out in its issue of December 12,
when commenting on plans for the sym-
posium, it would have been wiser not to
have courted his kind of comments be-
fore such an audience, which included
influential people from the countries
providing us with most of our overseas
capital.
This summary of views expressed at
the symposium necessarily (for reasons
of space) has to stop short of reviewing
the opinion of experts from Japan, the
United States and Germany on whether
Australia is an attractive place for for-
eign investment. This will be done in
subsequent issues, together with an
examination of the symposium's consid-
eration of two essentially local subjects:
“A critical look at stockbroking and
underwriting” and “Are the stock ex-
changes in Australia meeting their
challenge?” '

More Than a Spectacle
The home-grown optical industry
Australia’s optical industry is by no
means a giant when compared with
the American, European and Japanese
complexes. That has not prevented it
from becoming as efficient and, to a
lesser extent, as mechanised.
The industry first started to cut its
adult teeth after World War II when,
because of a shortage of materials over-
seas, it had to become self-sufficient.
Today our optical industry is virtually
independent save for optical glass, all of
which is imported. This kind of glass
could be made here, say optical com-
panies The Bulletin spoke to, but
apparently the economics of manufac-
ture are prohibitive. “Several overseas
glass companies (Corning, Pilkington)
have established themselves here and, if
local optical glass manufacture was a
financially sound proposition, they
would undoubtedly make it,” one
executive said.
“Optical industry” is a broad term,
embracing spectacle lens and frame
manufacture, and scientific, industrial
and technical optical equipment. In the
spectacle lens field there appears to be
a certain amount of over-capacity. This,
in itself, is not dangerous, as the slack
will be taken up in what promises to
be a “vast future.”
A shot in the arm for the spectacle
business has been the introduction of
high-fashion frames, most of which are
designed and manufactured in Australia.
In the technical field a great demand
for surveying equipment has stemmed
from the level of building activity. In a
broader sense, projects such as dam
building, expressways, and electricity
and gas supplies call for expensive and
specialised equipment.
A spokesman for Australian Optical
Holdings Ltd. said the Australian optical
industry “is now complete in itself. In
the case of any emergency it would be
completely self-sufficient but for optical
glass, which would probably be made
here anyway. At the moment all our
glass blanks come from overseas. Plastic
or synthetic lenses are being made in
Adelaide from a material called CR39.
It is a new venture in Australia and one
which will undoubtedly develop over
the next five years. Lenses made from
this material are as scratch-proof as
glass.
“As far as spectacle frames are con-
cerned we have no need to import,
although quite a few from Europe do
come into the country. People are only
just now becoming conscious of the
fashion aspect of frames, so there is still
a lot of room for expansion. The Aus-
tralian industry is producing frames
equal to anything else in the world and
at a very reasonable price. The price of
a pair of spectacles here is definitely
lower than in America or Europe. Brit-
tain, of course, has its national health
scheme, so it’s very hard to compare
costs.”
The Bulletin spoke to Mr E. Hurst,
a director of Martin Wells Holdings
Ltd, spectacle frame maker and a re-
cent addition to stock exchange lists.
Mr Hurst said the optical industry “has
great scope in Australia. Spectacles are
standard equipment nowadays and are
becoming as necessary as clothes. This
is because more demands are being
made on the human body today. Traffic,
close work, long periods of concentra-
tion all these are combining to make
glasses necessary.
“But there is room for even further
improvement. In Australia there are
one and a half pairs of spectacles for
every spectacle wearer. In America
there are four pairs for every wearer
and in Europe three. As the Australian
public becomes more conscious of fash-
ion in glasses we'll draw closer to over-
seas spectacle wardrobes. When you
consider that spectacles last for a long
time and, unless they’re broken, never
wear out, they are a relatively inexpen-
sive fashion item as far as women are
concerned. And the fashions in glasses
don’t date as quickly as they do in
clothes.”
A spokesman for a wholesale seller of
spectacle frames and eye-testing equip-
ment and lens grinder said that during
buoyant periods in the economy the opti-
cal industry faced a labor problem. “Be-
cause there is not a very big demand
for lenses the industry cannot afford to
pay overtime and some optical mechan-
ics leave the industry to take on more
lucrative jobs.
“Although optical mechanics are paid
above-award wages the lack of overtime
means they are ndt very highly paid.
However, when the economy is less

buoyant and there is unemployment, the
optical mechanic returns t<~ his old
trade. At any time he can always find a
job.”
The spokesman said the industry had
become highly mechanised in recent
years. “Although we cannot afford the
expensive machinery such as is used in
America (we haven’t the demand to
warrant such expenditure), the mach-
ines we are using now have speeded up
the lens-making process without sacri-
ficing any quality. Automatic grinders
and diamond wheels, even if expensive
to purchase, have meant that we are in
a position to supply more, faster.”
One of the companies on the scientific,
technical and industrial side of the
optical business is Esdaile (Holdings)
Limited. It supplies and manufactures,
among other things, builders’ optical
levels, theodolites and other surveying
equipment, telescopes, binoculars and
magnifiers. Managing director Mr K. M.
Richardson said there was a great future
in Australia for photogrammetric equip-
ment. “We are an expanding nation
and the need for this equipment (which,
from aerial photographs, prepares highly
accurate contour maps) is growing with
us. Although it is a very expensive piece
of machinery (£15,000 to £20,000), it
can pay for itself fairly quickly because
of the time saved. Photogrammetric
equipment is used by the Lands Depart-
ment, gas and electricity authorities, shire
councils, in fact by anyone whose
activities cover vast areas.
“The recent building boom has caused
a great demand for smaller surveying
equipment such as theodolites and
optical builders’ levels, which we manu-
facture ourselves. With more and more
specialised and precision machinery being
used in industry every day, there is also
a strong demand for specialised levels to
ensure optimum efficiency of operation.
Among our other manufactures are
stereoscopes (for reading aerial photo-
graphs in three dimensions), range-
finders and height-finders and a machine
called an anatascope, used for viewing
and photographing cancer in women. So
far we have exported this item to New
Zealand, South Africa, North America
and Sweden. We are currently negoti-
ating to export it to South America.”
Mr Richardson said there was a good
demand for binoculars and telescopes.
“Binoculars have come down in price
so dramatically over the past few years
that they are now well within the reach
of everybody. The largest supply comes
from Japan, which is able to manu-
facture at a much lower cost than
England or Germany, our former two
chief sources of supply.”

British Portfolio Interest
An absolute rise predicted
As Australian share prices have been
drifting rudderless for more than a
month, on the face of it not much grist
seems to have been coming from over-
seas portfolio investment. This is under-
standable in the case of the United States,
what with the equalisation tax which
Mr Johnson has just prolonged. It is
less so with Britain, where a bigger flow
from politically distraught investors
might have been expected.
Apropos of this, it was interesting to
hear Mr Michael Shanks, a London
economics journalist, tell the Stock Ex-
change of Melbourne's symposium on
Investment in Australia last week that,
taking a two-year view, he expected
portfolio investment from the UK in the
Australian market to rise both absolutely
and in proportion to direct investment.
He didn't think it would be a
“dramatic” rise, though it might well be-
come so in the event of a “revival of
the kind of fears which beset us in the
autumn crisis, fears about the future of
the British economy or the stability of
sterling.” Further, he said another
factor which could become important
would be a flight of capital to avoid a
corporation or capital gains tax.
However. Mr Shanks doubted very
much whether the sort of money that
might come would do us much good.
For it would be “by definition money
that would be likely to return to Britain
on a change of government or in the
economic prospects of the UK and we
in Britain have had quite a lot of ex-
perience in recent years of the hazards
of living on hot money.”
Although he thought Australian share
yields were, on the whole, “distinctly on
the low side", the flow of institutional
money from the UK would be acceler-
ated if the Australian capital market
could be expanded. He said that “in-
stitutional investors in London tell me
that the equity market in named stocks
is uncomfortably narrow.”
Decimal Pickings
good progress is being made
in converting accounting machines
in readiness for decimal currency, “C”-
Day next February 14, it seems unlikely
that the task will be anything like com-
pleted by then. From this it can be
reasoned that many businesses, large
and small, will be virtually compelled to
buy some brand new equipment to tide
them over, quite apart from their normal
replacements and expansion require-
ments.
One of the newcomers to ’Change in
this field is Business Equipment Holdings
Ltd, whose 10s. shares were listed for
the first time (in Melbourne only) late
last year and have fluctuated within a
range of 19s.‘and 16s. (the initial price)
since then. They now stand at 17s. 9d.
to yield 5.1 p.c. on the prospectus divi-
dend estimate of 9 p.c.
Last week’s interim report (the first as
a public company) didn't give any figures
(the year to June 30 last year gave profits
equal to an earnings rate of 14.63 p.c.).
Yet it was highly optimistic, not so much
for this year's result, which is only
expected to be “sound”, but subsequently

Sims Pays Again
A fter three years’ absence from the
dividend lists, scrap metal dealer
Albert G. Sims has returned with an
i'nterim distribution of 3i p.c. This
indicates resumption of the 1961 rate
of 61 p.c.
The payment comes after a dramatic
increase in profit for the six months to
December. At £235,625 it is almost 75
p.c. of the last full year’s profit of
£315,511. Chairman Mr G. S. Gilder
says that trading volume increased
during the period.
The current trading position and
liquidity of the company is '‘quite satis-
factory”, he says. Another portion of
A. G. Sims’ bugbear, Morts Dock, has
been sold and negotiations are in pro-
gress for the sale of the rest of the land.
The market marked the ss. shares down
Id. to 6s. lid. on the announcement of
the return to dividend payments. At that
price they yield 4.8 p.c.
Another Record?
TAespite a drop in wool prices in the
latest selling season, woolbroker
A. G. Webster expects a higher profit
for 1964-65. Directors expect profits
from other departments to offset any
reduced earnings caused by the lower
wool prices.
In the light of the expected higher
profit, interim dividend has been raised
from 31 p.c. to 5 p.c. Last year a final
9-1/6 p.c. was paid to lift total dividend
from 10 to 12i p.c. This followed a
record profit of £124,295, equal to an
earning rate of 24.7 p.c.

given so no physical comparison can be
made. However, directors expect the
advent of the new Holden to contribute
significantly to the company’s 1964-65
results which should compare “favor-
ably” with 1963-64’s profit of £62,225.
Interim dividend is again 71 p.c. Last
year’s full payout was 20 p.c., including
a 5 p.c. bonus.

Brighter Steel
Oydney steel and aluminium merchant
William Atkins Holdings Ltd con-
tinues to look a picture of health. Latest
news from the company (winch has been
on public lists since 1937) is that pro-
fit is substantially higher, following an
increase in sales. The company is not
keeping all its earnings and will pay a
higher interim dividend of 61 p.c., com-
pared with the previous year’s 5 p.c.
Regrettably no figures are given in
the interim report, an omission share-
holders have complained about for
years. Directors say that all subsidiaries
contributed to the “very satisfactory”
trading result for the half-year to
December. There is every indication
that results for the full year should re-
flect the present buoyant trend.
The establishment of an annual divi-
dend of 121 p.c. follows last year’s
higher rate of 111 p.c., paid on capital
increased T>y a one-for-five bonus issue.
In 1962 and 1963 William Atkins re-
duced dividend to 10 p.c. because of
post-credit Squeeze difficulties. On the
latest dividend the ss. shares yield 4.4
p.c. from their present price of 14s. 3d.,
the highest level this year.
Good Casting
Cydney-based diecaster Raynors Hold-
ings Ltd will raise £206,292 with a
premium share issue. All told, 589,405
ss. shares, at 2s. premium, will be avail-
able to shareholders on the basis of
two-for-five. The issue will raise paid
ordinary capital to £515,729.
Directors said the issue would provide
funds to continue expansion of the
company's business in NSW, Victoria
and South Australia. They anticipate
that “in the absence of a material
change in economic conditions” the 11
p.c. dividend will be maintained on in-
creased capital. Dividend .was raised
from 10 p.c. to 11 p.c. last year, fol-
lowing the third successive increase in
profits and because of the “incidence of
higher living costs”.
Directors add that turnover for the
half-year ended December has in-
creased and orders in hand “are in
excess” of those held at the same date
last year. Raynors’ shares are presently
selling for 13s. and yield 4.2 p.c. from
the dividend and 8 p.c. from earnings.
Slow Bowling
\ fter a severe drop in pre-tax profit
for the six months to December 31,
Bowling Centres (Holdings) Ltd direc-
tors have decided not to pay an interim
dividend. The omission is also due to
a “continued shortage of funds”.
Unaudited half-year profit of £63,278
remained after £71,300 depreciation. A
tax provision of 9s. in the £ leaves a net
profit of £34,803. Figures for the six
months to December, 1963, were: Pre-
tax profit, £171,111; depreciation,
£54,100; net profit £100,528.
In their interim report, directors say
efforts to promote greater interest and
competition in ten-pin bowling are being

The Auto-Coin Drycleaning subsidi-
ary has made progress during the half-
year. The company-owned villages in
Sydney are operating profitably, while

Beer Dividend
United Brewery, a major
shareholder in Melbourne’s Carlton
and United Breweries, continues to dis-
tribute most of its annual profit to
shareholders. Earning rate in the latest
year to December 31 established a four-
teen year record of 15.3 p.c. The five-
year-old dividend of 13 p.c. is to be
lifted to 133 p.c.
The peak profit was £467,000. As
usual, most of it came in the form of
dividends from CUB. The figure was
£445,000 for the latest year.
Not So Sticky
A cautious note from Davis Gelatine
Consolidated Ltd says sales and
trading profits of the group have shown
a “reasonable” increase in the Decem-
ber half-year.
Guardedly, the interim report says “as
far as the board can judge at this stage,
it will be possible for the company
again to pay dividends amounting in
total to 9 p.c. for the full year”. To
bring interim and final payment rates
close together, the interim has been
raised from 3 p.c. to 4 p.c. Last year
the full rate was raised to 9 p.c.
Since its formation as a public com-
pany in 1955-56 Devis Gelatine had
paid 8 p.c. From the higher dividend
the 10s. shares currently return 4.6 p.c.
at a price of 19s. 7d. At this level they
appear to be a reasonable purchase.
The Brisbane Line

attending the investment symposium
in Melbourne last week, The Bulletin

oil shares index looked pretty sick.
“True enough,” was the riposte. “It seems
that when Brisbane starts an index this
is a signal for selling.”

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Mayne Nickless and its Acquisitions
Share prices high compared with Brambles
rpwo “transport” companies have earlier
A reported on the first six months
of their 1964- 65 years. Judging
by these reports, it would seem that the
calendar year 1964 has been a good one
for this particular industry. Mayne
Nickless Ltd has just reported mounting
turnover, “slightly higher” group profit,
and a steady interim dividend for the
December half year.
Unfortunately, it seems difficult to
make a comparison with the “previous
corresponding” period because of the
acquisitions that have been made during
that six months. In particular, the issue
will be clouded by the acquisition of
Metropolitan Industries, whose last re-
ported profit related to the 1962-63
year. It is understood that the 1963-64
profit was lower than £71,000 of the
1962-63 year but, so far as I can see,
the full information would not help to
make any worthwhile estimates of the
results that may have been achieved
since absorption into the Refrigerated
Services Division of Mayne Nickless.
Other acquisitions which can also affect
the comparability of the figures would be
W. T. V. Hoskins (acquired in March,
1964), Diesel Services and John Coady
Pty Ltd (acquired in October, 1964).
However, it is unlikely that Mayne
Nickless would make any mistakes when
assessing the future prospects of another
transport company. Thus it can be
assumed that these acquisitions will not
water the per share earnings.
Another factor of major importance
is the interest that the P and O Co. of
Australia has taken in Mayne Nickless.
This interest only amounted to an in-
crease of £3757 in the ordinary capital
in 1963-64, but there will be an in-
crease of a further £176,598 in 1964-65
and increases of £135,266 in 1965-66
and 1966-67. As a result of this trans-
action, Mayne Nickless will receive
funds totalling £1,465,386, of which
£450,880 will represent ordinary capital.
In terms of the dividend payment that
will have to be made, assuming the con-
tinuance of the 123 p.c. rate, these funds
will cost £56,360 per annum or 3.85 p.c.
after tax. This would be equivalent to
borrowing at the rate of 6.7 p.c. and is
therefore rather attractive. Furthermore,
the P and O Co. of Australia will lend
debenture' money of £750,000 for a
period of ten years at an unstated rate
of interest. These funds will be used
to reduce short-term borrowings and will
go a long way to correcting the trend
towards an imbalance which seemed to
be occurring in this item, so far as can
be judged by the published balance
sheets.
The amount repayable before June 30,
1965, according to the consolidated
balance sheet at June 30, 1964, totalled
£1,019,378, out of total term liabilities
of £1,249,154. In addition, the figure
“bank loans and overdrafts, net'’ had
increased by nearly £270,000 to just
under £960,000 at June 30, 1964. It
has been stated in the chairman's
address that, after redeeming the issue
of 8 p.c. notes which fell due on Decem-
ber 31 last: “The balance of the loan
(from the P and O Co. of Aust.) will
reduce bank loans and/or secured depo-
sits, as may be advisable.” For this
reason, it will be interesting to see the
result when the 1965 balance sheet is
available. Mayne Nickless might be in
need of further funds in addition to the
£574,000 received from the call on the
P and O shares made on July 1, 1964,
and'the £750,000 loan on December 31,
1964.
This feeling has been accentuated by
the fact that £152,000 had to be found
for the cash portion of the Metropolitan
Industries takeover. Therefore it was not
surprising that, in addition to allotting
145,590 shares to P and O Co. of Aust.,
as a result of the Metropolitan Industries
takeover, a further 100,000 were allotted
to “a subsidiary of the Peninsular and
Oriental Steam Navigation Company,
United Kingdom”. These two allots
ments would have produced about

£440,000. However, Mayne Nickless
has since continued to make investments.
Apart from acquiring K. F. Boxwell
Pty Ltd, of Queensland, a substantial
investment of £375,000 has been made
in Allied Freightways Ltd, of New Zea-
land. It may be that this latter invest-
ment will not be wholly subscribed in
cash.
So far as it is possible to make out
at this stage, ordinary capital ranking
for the interim dividend will have in-
creased by about 25 p.c. over the figure
at June 30, 1964. If the adjusted earning
rate is to be maintained, then the six
months’ profit will need to be of the
order of £275,000 to indicate annual
earnings of about £500,000. The second
half of the year will certainly see a
further increase in ordinary capital of
£72,745 as a result of the shares allotted
to P and O Co. of Australia in terms of
the March, 1964, agreement on January
4, 1965.
If the results of Brambles Industries
Ltd are any guide, Mayne Nickless
should have every possibility of in-
creasing profits for the first six months
of 1964-65 without the benefit of the
profits of acquisitions during the period.
(Brambles reported an increase of about
20 p.c. in net profit after tax, despite an
increase of 212 p.c. in the tax provi-
sion!) However, some regard must be
paid to the “warning” of the effect of
the increases in the basic wage and
annual leave on Mayne Nickless given
in the managing director's report of
1964. In this same report, attention was
also drawn to the rising incidence of
taxation (of all forms). While it is
difficult to find any similarity between
the figures for income tax given in this
report and those given in the published
profit and loss accounts, the figures con-
verted to an index basis give some

These figures indicate that the rapid
growth in turnover over the last three
years has been matched by “profit”,
despite the much greater growth in
payroll tax, which should be at least a
rough guide to the increase which has
taken place in the group’s major cost
factor, wages and salaries.
Recently, the shares in Mayne Nick-
less have been selling at 355. 3d. which
is 7d. more than the subsidiary of
P and O, UK, paid for its 100,000. At
this level the dividend yield is 3.5 p.c.
and, assuming the maintenance of the
1963-64 earning rate, the earnings yield
would be 6.2 p.c. The price is rather
high in comparison with Brambles but
still in line with the prices that have
been paid for MN’s shares over the
last two years, when prospects did not
always seem so bright.

In Defence of Shorting
And a gingerly entrance into oil
npHE investment symposium in Mel-
A bourne has proved well worth while.
Plenty of contentious matters were
raised by the distinguished group of
speakers and nothing sparks interest as
quickly as informed differences of
opinion.
Although the gates at Mount Isa are
now open, it will be several months
before operations return to normal.
Meanwhile, minor labor disputes seem
bound to occur.
In one way, the shorting of great
industrial enterprises such as Mount Isa
and CSR is little less than expressing
contempt for the Australian free-enter-
prise system. The defence of the specu-
lator is that the price of the shares of
the company is of critical concern, not
simply the company itself.
In fact the shorting of shares in a
company can later prove to be a benefit
to that company even when the seller is
forced to buy back in again. If there
has been a run on the shares then buy-
ing (in quantity) would have a steadying
influence on the share price. Not that
the 300 Mount Isa I have to buy back
in the next week or so will affect the
market.
Last week I gingerly eased myself into
the oil market. My target was the AAO
contributing shares. The average price
of the rights during the issue a few
months ago was 2s. 3d. With the Is. 6d.
application money thrown in, the price
of the contributings was in the vicinity
of 3s. 9d. for the start of their listed
life. Then, a couple of weeks ago, the
market started to slide. When the con-
tributing shares fell under 2s. and at
the same time the old shares were begin-
ning to firm, the temptation was too
much. In I went with an order to buy
500 shares at 2s. If the price goes to
2s. 9d. these shares will go out of the
portfolio as quickly as they came in!
A more permanent investment is
probably the 500 A. G. Sims, purchased
at 6s. lid. In the same way as there
are awards for the best annual reports,
then so could there be awards for the
best management. The present directors
of A. G. Sims would be well in the
running for first prize.
During 1962 the outlook was very
bleak for A. G. Sims. Governed then
by a board of working directors domi-
nated by Mr A. G. Sims, the company
had gone beyond its traditional field of
scrap metal operations and established
a shipping company in Hong Kong.
Also, as part of the expansion pro-
gramme, the Mort's Dock property at
Balmain was purchased for £825,000.
Both these decisions proved disastrous
and in 1962 the bank had to step in to
appoint a management committee.
This management committee, which
now forms the basis of the present board
of directors, was faced with huge losses
incurred by the shipping company, a
negative working capital and a waterside
property bringing in no income. Yet,
within two years, the directors had com-
pletely reorganised the business and
were able to present a good profit.
Equally impressive was the rise in the
working capital ratio from 0.83 to 1.90.
Early this week directors announced
a profit of £236,000 and a tax provision
of £264,000 for the first six months of
the current year. Based on this tax pro-
vision, earning rate on an annual basis
is over the 20 p.c. mark. The company
is also making a return to the dividend
lists with a payment of 31 p.c.
The prospect of a further increase in
the dividend rate and the likelihood of
a capital return in the next year makes
the shares still an interesting proposition
at 7s.
The portfolio doesn’t seem to be show-
ing much life. I could not clear broker-
age on NG Goldfields or Austral Motors.
Treloar did a little better with a £5 profit.
A small profit of a few pounds also
showed on the R. and N. Statham shares
which were bought back at an average
price of 14s. 3d.
Transactions for the week were:

THE MAN ON THE LAND
The Not-so-humble Spud
Another shortage on the way
VTo meal in Australia is complete with-
' out the potato. So much a part of
the culinary scene is the potato that it
goes by a number of affectionate nick-
names —spud, tatie, murphy—and it is
boiled, mashed, baked and chipped. It
is grown, by and large, by a tight-lipped
and somewhat select farming fraternity
known collectively as “spud-diggers”.
For the fellow “on spuds” nothing is
quite as good for business as a potato
shortage. Australians may do without
a number of things if they have to. They
do not like going without spuds.
Every few years there is inevitably a
shortage. When this happens the spuds
can still be obtained, at a price. These
periodic upsurges in price are the fruit
on the sideboard for the potato boys.
This writer would not be so incau-
tious as to suggest that all potato grow-
ers make a thing of capitalising on
shortages, or that these shortages are
actually engineered. That would be a
terrible thing to suggest and would de-
serve a thump on the head from any
self-respecting potato farmer.
Why, for sure, it’s the merchants pro-
bably at the back of it. (Primary pro-
duce merchants are not likely to take
offence at this because they have learned
to live with it—water off the duck’s
back.)
But whenever there is a shortage you
can be quite sure that someone, some-
where, has a shed full of spuds and that
he’ll sell them to you for maybe seven
to ten quid a bag compared with the
normal two or three. This writer has
nothing to hide. He’s bought “black”
spuds before and he will probably do it
again.
In a way, there is a rough sort of
justice here. All things considered, the
metropolitan nine-to-five worker gets his
potatoes pretty cheap. A shortage once
in a while helps restore the balance.
Potatoes can be tricky things to grow.
Despite modern machinery now avail-
able to harvest them, the fact remains
that lumping bags of potatoes around is
back-breaking work.
There are strong indications that
another potato shortage is headed our
way. Pretty soon now the metropolitan
papers will be able to run the headlines:
Potato Famine Hits Families.
If there is a shortage of potatoes in
Australia imports cannot greatly ease the
situation. This is because of strict
quarantine regulations affecting New
Zealand potatoes, the main potential
overseas supply.
This coming shortage, predicted by
pretty knowledgeable men in the trade,
is likely to be felt about May. It will
be a combination of a number of factors
and it may very well be a turning point.
There is a factor present now which,
only five years ago, was non-existent.
This is the extension of the contract
system of growing potatoes.
Growers contract to supply a large
manufacturing plant which turns out
potatoes in ready-packaged form. A
good many restaurants and hotels are
using them almost exclusively now.
They can be obtained ready mashed
also. Housewives are buying them,
though generally they are a little dearer
than buying brown spuds.
The contract system has resulted in
a rationalisation of potato growing in
a number of areas. Bigger farms, with
more mechanical equipment and neces-

shortage, oversupply, boom pattern does
not suit the new type of grower at all—
or the firm supplying him with a con-
tract.
This development is both a contribu-
ting reason for young farmers going out
of potatoes and an end-result of young
farmers giving potatoes away for some-
thing less arduous. As in any dramatic
change in farming methods, it is diffi-
cult to draw a precise cause-and-effect
conclusion.
The statistics tell us the position, if
not the reasons. In Victoria alone, in
1965, there are 25 p.c. fewer potato
growers than there were in 1962. The
acreage under potatoes has decreased by
18 p.c. compared with last year.
The unusually cold and wet spring
must reduce the harvest further in Vic-
toria and also in South Australia and
Tasmania. There are no indications of
bigger than usual crops in NSW,
Queensland and Western Australia.
It is not, therefore, surprising that
there is increasing talk of “potato
stabilisation”. Those growers who have
invested heavily in bigger acreages
(often buying out a neighbor who has
left the game), and who perhaps have
committed themselves to supplying a
contract, want to protect themselves.
They want guaranteed prices. If they
cannot be sure of a continued, and
consistent, level of payable prices, then
the machinery cannot be paid off, the
mortgage cannot be cleared, and the
firm supplying the contract may decide
to renew that contract at a lower figure.
It is the trend in all farming and it is
inescapable. The old style shortage
used to set things to rights in its fashion
—boom prices for the fellow careful
enough to store a couple of hundred
bags in a shed. Now it is not good
enough.
At the present moment the advocates
of a potato stabilisation plan believe they
have growers in all States won over
except in NSW. They believe they
must have a Federal scheme going or
(Section 92 again) interstate shipments
can wreck any price stabilisation plan.
Moves are going ahead to get the NSW
growers on side.
Potatoes, therefore, are pretty much
in the same position right now as eggs
(except that in the case of eggs it is
South Australia which is the hold-out
State).
We will probably experience a potato
shortage in May this year and we will
probably see some growers, and mer-
chants, cashing in on it. But the forces
in favor of stabilisation are gathering
strength. Within a few years they are
likely to win. It’s the trend. As sure
as eggs, or as sure as spuds if you like,
it’s unmistakable, right or wrong.
