Over the waves, safely, in protective wear made with
Geon vinyl resin. In the manufacture of life lackets, life belts and other marine wear,
Geon is a friend indeed. Tough on the job, film made from Geon withstands the
abuse of sunshine, salt water, soft water ... is wear and tear resistant. Soft and pliable,
it allows freedom of movement, is colour-fastly bright for easy “spotting”. More and
more manufacturers are discovering how Geon improves products or helps evolve new
ones. Have you a product we can help improve or develop?

He’ll do 614 mph on land—
but he won’t claim the record
'HIS TAA T-Jet pilot
A will be able to perform
this feat because of a miracle
of modern science.
He’ll be at the controls of a
Whispering T-Jet cruising at 614
mph but he’ll be stationary on
the ground in a £500,000 flight
simulator.
TAA has ordered the simulator
which is the most modern of its
kind in the world.
The simulator is made up of
the nose section of a Whispering
T-Jet with a fully equipped flight
deck. Controls and instruments
are coupled to a complex digital
computer enabling a pilot to
experience all the sensations of
flying the T-Jet without leaving
the ground. Even the sound of
flying is simulated.
The simulator will maintaia
TAA’s leadership in aircrew pro-
ficiency and aircraft reliability.
Air travellers can continue to
rely on TAA’s double depend-
ability of men and machines
as the jet age develops in
Australia.

TOYOTA have built the Lite-Stout for those who want a
really tough, hard-working, truck-size ute that has sedan
car comfort for three passengers—truly rugged but refined.
Utilities made from passenger cars just can’t carry the
truck-type loads like the TOYOTA Lite-Stout—its big load
area carries more than a ton. TOYOTA’S tough 65 B.H.P.
engine is really reliable—with lots of torque low down to
pull the big loads easily.
Under normal working conditions, loaded to capacity,
Lite-Stout gives up to 28 miles per gallon—32 m.p.g. on
light loads. The big brakes with finned drums give more
braking and less fade under heavy loads than any truck
at any price.
Easy handling, panoramic curved windscreen and passen-
ger car ride bring an entirely new feel to truck driving.
At only £1,058, TOYOTA toughness in the chassis, solid
reliability in the motor, economy on the go, Lite-Stout
gives you more for your money than any utility on the road
today.

TOYOTA Lite-Stout is available with either steel tray

Girder-type chassis makes Lite-Stout especially suitable
for mounting special bodies.

National Notebook
British Only More So
/Certainly they didn’t have William
Dobell’s drawing of the famous
fingers in their V-for-victory position;
there may not have been the com-
mercial breaks on television backed by
the jingle “This was a Man”; “D-Day”
posters may not have caught the eye in
newspapers, but it still seemed a mystery
why the British were making so embar-
rassingly little headway with a memorial
appeal for the most British of all men.
Not only was the Sir Winston Churchill
Appeal floundering in Britain, it was
falling short of the mark in New
Zealand, too.
Australian appeal organisers could
perhaps be -forgiven a smile of self-
satisfaction. With counting nearly com-
plete, the appeal figure stood at
£2,122,182. A final figure of £2,150,000
is expected, more than double the target
figure of £1 million.
This result is all the more striking as
fund-raising hasn’t been particularly
buoyant lately. This year’s door-knock
appeal for £150,000 by the Foundation
for Aboriginal Affairs brought in only
£BO.OOO.
The Federal Government’s contribu-
tion to the Churchill Appeal was
£150,000, the State Governments
£130,000, private companies operating
nationally £455,000, local donations such
as those from companies based in only
one State, individuals and organisations
provided £600,666. The door-knock
memorial appeal figures to date are
£821,516.
In Britain, with more than half of the
month set aside for the appeal gone, the
figures last week looked lame by com-
parison. Sheffield, for example, with a
target of £33,500, had raised £950; Man-
chester, with a target of £49,000, could
manage only £186; and Bristol, with a
target of £31,250, had raised £325. The
results from other centres also fell well
short.
In New Zealand, where they had
hoped for £500,000, the figure looked
like being only £160,000.
Mr Tom Staley, personal assistant
to Mr W. J. Kilpatrick, the National
Chairman of the Australian appeal, says
that the British results are not as bad
as the Press reports have made out. Aus-
tralia had fewer restrictions on keeping
the plan a top secret before Sir Winston’s
death compared with Britain, thus
enabling more organisation before the
appeal. Furthermore, the Australian
appeal was all centred around the one
day. In Britain it is going on all
month. The lack of security restrictions
here also enabled an advanced organisa-
tion to raise the bulk of the donations
before the door-knock appeal.
In New Zealand, Mr Staley feels that
the absence of taxation benefits for dona-
tions over £1 may explain the low figures
to some extent. The fact that donations
to approved charities are tax deductible
in Australia is a big spur to generosity.
Of course the answer may well be that
Sir Robert Menzies is right and we are
British to our bootstraps, only more so.
Top Journalist
oebbels would have been a top
journalist under any regime,”
Sydney historian Dr E. K. Bramsted told
us. Dr Bramsted’s book on Hitler’s
Propaganda Minister will be published
next month in the United States. “As
it was, he showed that in a totalitarian
state a skilful propagandist—and Goeb-
bels certainly was that can condition
people into accepting a great many
things.”
Dr Bramsted’s book, “Goebbels and
National Socialist Propaganda, 1925-
1945”, has already been described by
the British authority on Nazi Germany,
Sir John Wheeler-Bennett, as a “remark-
able and original contribution not only
to the history of the Third Reich but to
the more complete understanding of the
Second World War”.
The Michigan State University Press,
whose director, Dr Lyle Blair, is himself
formerly from Sydney, will publish the
book. The Cresset Press will bring out
a British edition later in the year.
In Sydney as part of his sabbatical
leave, Dr Blair said “Goebbels” was “a
very big book in every way”. That it is
with its 490 pages of text meticulously
footnoted and bibliographed.
Dr Bramsted, who is the Reader in
History at the University of Sydney,
was not only at the receiving end of
Goebbels’s propaganda in 1933 when the
Nazis came to power and he had to
leave Germany, but had another vantage
point from which to observe it in action
when he worked in political intelligence
for the British Government during the
war, first with the BBC and later with
the Foreign Office. He joined Sydney
University’s History Department in 1952.
One minor frustration during his
research, most of it done in 1958 on a
study tour of Europe, was that the
British Government’s ban on releasing
secret documents meant that he
was unable to read even his own memos
and internal correspondence.
Dr Bramsted is now working on a
study of Lord Robert Cecil, the eminent
British supporter of the League of
Nations. “What intrigues me is not just
why that gang of fanatics and thugs got
into power in Germany, but why so
many leading men of goodwill in the
democracies were so blind to what was
happening,” he said.
Self-supporting
T>eter Pagan arrived slightly out of
breath. “I thought I wasn't going to
be able to get here on time,” he said.
“So many people saying ‘Hello, haven’t
I seen your face somewhere?’ or, worse,
‘Don’t you remember me?’ 1 feel such
a fool. After all, it’s been 20 years since
I went to New York to take up acting,
yet I still am expected to remember old
family friends.
“It's extraordinary how much I sud-
denly want to feel at home back here in
"Apart from being captivated by the malty tang of our export lager
what qualifications have you?"

Your C. Itoh man
makes South Pacific fishing
his business, too
From catch to finish—freezing, canning, market-
ing a man from C. Itoh, one of Japan's oldest and
largest international trading companies, lives on-
the-spot—down at the beach, on the boats with
the fishermen, wherever his expert assistance is
needed. For example, you'll find C. Itoh deep-sea
fishing experts living in the Fiji islands of the
South Pacific. In fact, C. Itoh's international net-
work of 80 overseas offices and affiliates can put
a C. Itoh weaving, steel, ceramic, mining, [umber-
ing or any other kind of expert on just about any
spot in the world you care to name.
Why not let C. Itoh & Co. supply the kind of
technical assistance and trading know-how—whe-
ther it be in export, import, triangular trade or a
joint investment venture—that can make all the
difference in your own business ?

Australia,” Mr Pagan added. “To be
re-accepted, as it were. All I wanted to
do when I sailed away at the age of 24
was to get out of the place. I wasn’t
one of those who weep as they wave
goodbye at Woolloomooloo. But when
I leave this time I shouldn’t be surprised
if a tear or two falls from these crusty
eyes.”
He looked, in his comfortable tweed
suit and protruding paisley pocket hand-
kerchief, very much like Colonel Picker-
ing. He has just finished playing that
role in an American touring production
of “My Fair Lady” which starred Ray
Milland as Higgins. “Being English I
usually get cast in that sort of part,” he
said. Being English? “Did I say that?
I mean that in America the agents and
audiences see me as being* English. I’d
much rather be known as an Australian
but you know how it is in America: If
you speak English at all properly you
must be English.”
As one of the few Australian actors
who has managed to earn an extremely
comfortable living in America for 20
years without ever really starring in any-
thing, Peter Pagan, now in his mid-
forties, is a happy man. “I’ve never had
a burning ambition to be a great star.
I really don't bother about publicity
much: I like to act, that's all.” And he
knew what he meant by that. “Honestly,
I think the way American actors are
tying themselves in mental knots trying
to find motivations for their performances
is so much nonsense. I was brought up
to believe that actors are people who can
pretend to be other people, publicly and
convincingly. And if they can't do that
without severe mental gymnastics and
‘justifications’ then they're just not pro-
fessionals.
“What's more,” he went on, with ad-
mirable breath-control, “if they can’t be
heard clearly in the back row, they're
just no good.” Emotional acting likewise?
“Most definitely. It's a matter of know-
ing what you can do and being able to
do it every night.”
Before leaving Australia Pagan played
the juvenile lead in “The Overlanders”
and roles in one or two other Austra-
lian films that he says he can’t remem-
ber and would rather forget. Then he
'went to the United States.
In America doors swung open on well-
oiled hinges and the young Pagan found
himself with an agent, invitations to dine
with Beatrice Lillie and Oscar Hammer-
stein and membership of the Yale Club.
“I lived at the club and went out on the
town. I was a new face, you see. It
didn't last long but it was marvellous
while it did. Then I discovered that
Actors’ Equity would not allow me to
work in summer stock as I was an alien.
I could do local productions but not go
on tour. I was desperate, as there were
no new productions coming up on Broad-
way and funds were getting low.”
Enter Robert Porterfield with an idea
to start the Barter Theatre in Virginia.
“I joined that immediately. I spent two
years there playing every possible
English-style part they could find for me.
I was everybody’s idea of a juvenile lead
and I loved it. The audience used to
pay for their seats with jars of jam or
even a chicken. You could get a party
booking for a live pig. They still sell
seats for barter there. Who did I work
with? Gregory Peck, Ernest Borgnine,
Hume Cronyn, Margaret Phillips and any
number of others. We even took Shake-
speare to the Tennessee Hills where they
still speak pure Elizabethan. The effect
on audiences there of a live play was in-
credible. They laughed, wept, shouted,
fainted—really, it was quite unforget-
table, and very thrilling.”
After he left The Barter to return to
New York Pagan was content to settle
permanently in Manhattan with an
assured series of rather English roles
stretching out across the country, pos-
sibly forever. “It seemed like that, in a
way. I was no longer worried about
getting work. I knew they would always
want a good supporting actor with no
American accent and a bit of a name
for himself. That was me, then. It still
is me.”
No Rock ’n Roll Vicar
' I 'his week’s cover shows Arthur
Michael Ramsey, hundredth Primate
of All England, who is at present visit-
ing Australia. On page 21 Patrick Tenni-
son writes about the Church of England
in Australia. We will later publish an
interview with Dr Ramsey by Mr Tenm-
son.
Dr Ramsay is moving about Australia
with great speed and informality. But
wearing a life-saver’s cap at Bondi or
drinking billy tea does not make Dr
Ramsey a with-it, rock ’n’ roll vicar.
He has told his clergy in England
not to court popularity, or, “by sophis-
ticated attempts to be contemporary at
all costs, blunt the force that lies in the
universal imagery of the Bible.” He
offers no popular comforts. Faith is
hard, religion is not a cult of happiness,
some questions have no answers.
When British television interviewer
Daniel Farson asked him about the ex-
tent to which the Church had lost touch
with the people, he replied that he would
prefer to say that “the people have lost
touch with religion and God”.
Dr Ramsey’s cracking pace in Austra-
lia does not fit in with the popular picture
of him in Church circles in England. He
has himself made jokes about going down
in history as the “idle archbishop”.
But what an archbishop is may be as
important as what he does. An English
journalist wrote of him recently: “Dr
Ramsey is aware of the dangers of the
Church being too wrapped up in its own
affairs —apparently so vital at the time,
often so irrelevant to man or God half a
century later, as archbishops’ biographies
testify. He is desperately honest, and
very patient. He is a man of compas-
sion, and he just might turn out to be
a leader as well. It will be worth seeing
what he does with the Church of
England.”
INSPIRED BY THE LITTLE BOY FROM MANLY
feuLletin
80 Years Ago: March 28, 1885
WE are beginning to think that our
loyalty is doubted in certain
circles; for we consider we have been
subjected, if not to absolute insults,
at least to indifference at the hands of
the War Department. One instance
will suffice. Although we have care-
fully scanned the papers, we can see
J ., , * r
no acknowledgment of our contnbu-
non to the commissariat of the Soudan
contingent. The following was our
letter (which surely must have mis-
carried) to Mr Dalleyj “Bulletin
office, 10th March. 85. The Hon.
G. B. Dailey, Q.C., M.L.C., J.P.,
Attorney-General, Acting Colonial
Secretary, Minister for War, etc. Sir—
Fired by the noble conduct of the
little boy at Manly, we beg herewith
(for we were little boys once our-
selves, though not, unfortunately, of
Manly) to state that we have decided
upon giving the following prizes with
a view of inspiring our troops to deeds
of further valor:
“Prize I.—To the man who kills
the Mahdi One of Kirby’s best,
Prize 2.—To the man who dis-
c'up'rvrfrv the

cricketing trophy, the owner having no
further use for it.
“Prize 4. To the man who suc-
ceeds in getting back first One pair
boots (any size), colonial made.
“We wish this list to be read aloud
by the Commandant to the troops
when assembled on the quarter-deck
for Church, immediately after the
Chaplain has got to the end of
his so welcome ‘and now to God
the Father’.”
Nevermind; though we are slighted,
we proudly put our list in evidence.

"That one symbolises the Glorious Achievement of Revolutionary Socialism, that one is the Giant Stride
of the Free Society the big one means rain before morning."


PLAIN ENGLISH
The Refreshing Socialist
Tt is a refreshing exercise to compare
the views of a militant socialist
like Singapore’s Prime Minister, Mr
Lee Kuan Yew, with the policies of
the Australian Labor Party. In in-
viting him to address the Parliamen-
tary Labor Caucus, Mr A. Calwell may
not have expected, for example, such
a pithy summary of political realities
as Mr Lee’s statement that Communist
revolution in Asia came “not from
majority support but from majority
acquiescence”. The very same point
applies to Communist success in the
Australian trade unions and Labor
Parties; it comes not only from sup-
port of the Leftists but from the
“acquiescence” of the majority whom
Mr Calwell claims to represent.
Again, what must Mr Calwell and
his fellow Parliamentarians have felt
when Mr Lee told them Australian
troops could be needed in Malaysia
for another 20 years? Or take the
ALP’s foreign policy statement last
month, which offered only lukewarm
support for Australia’s defence of
Malaysia, and qualified such support
as it gave with demands for a treaty,
for United Nations intervention and
for a “friendship, trade and non-
aggression pact” with Indonesia.
Certainly Mr Lee was quite definite
that stopping Communism in South-
East Asia will depend as much on
providing “actual and visible improve-
ment in the lot of the people” as in
meeting military aggression, but, un-
like Mr Calwell, he was clear that
cultural delegations and economic aid
would not stop Indonesian guerrillas
raiding Malaysia. If Mr Lee had not
been a visiting militant socialist head
of state, but a young lawyer battling
for pre-selection in Victoria, he would
certainly have been invited to “ex-
plain” his views to the Victorian ALP
executive and then probably expelled.
What makes Mr Lee’s visit so re-
freshing is that his implied criticisms
of the Lederal Government were
equally shrewd and worthy of serious
thought. Lor instance, Mr Lee’s warn-
ings about the dangers of racial
divisions in Malaysia were meant to
induce wider Australian support for
the basic idea of Malaysia instead of
straight-out support for the present
Government of Kuala Lumpur, with
whose policies he feels the Australian
Government is too closely identified.
His unembroidered and plain-spoken
message to Australians is that “if
Malaysia should fail under Indonesian
pressure and the national boundaries
in South-East Asia are again altered,
then there will be no end to other
adjustments of boundaries in the whole
neighborhood”.
Oil to Burn?
lAne of the most significant features
of the current oil enquiry by the
Tariff Board is that it emphasises how
badly Australia still lacks a national
fuel policy. The most glaring example
of this is the continual refining and
disposal of Moonie oil despite the
obvious need to conserve indigenous
supplies of crude oil for defence pur-
poses. In view of the dangerous
military situation in Asia and Aus-
tralia’s new stepped-up defence policy,
the using up of these precious reserves
can only be classified as blind folly.
J. C. Horsfall of The Bulletin
(who discusses this problem on page
65) has in the past advocated a ban
on the extraction of Moonie oil and,
as compensation to the owners of the
field, Government payments to them
on the basis of an agreed theoretical
rate of extraction. Dr Malcolm
Mackay, MHR, has gone one step
further and urged the Government to
purchase the Moonie field. He
estimated that this could be done at
a cost of £5 million a year for fifteen
years which, in the context of a
defence budget of £400,000,000 a
year, is cheap.
Indeed a Government undertaking
to buy any new commercial field dis-
covered by the oil search industry,
until enough crude oil reserves are
proven, would not only conserve our
resources but may also be a sufficient
guarantee to ensure rapid exploration.
Apart from Moonie, other fields such
as Alton in Queensland. Yardarino
and Barrow Island in Western Aus-
tralia are good prospects, while some
areas in Queensland and the Northern
Territory are promising, and other
possibilities outside proven areas
urgently need exploration backed by
guarantees.
But the basic point is that we do not
have anything like enough oil reserves
to meet our needs, even for a short
emergency. In these circumstances it
is fantastic that the Minister for
National Development should have
announced a reduction in the oil search
subsidy programme and that the
Tariff Board’s terms of reference in
its current inquiry should centre on
the problem of using up indigenous
oil rather than conserving it.
The C. of E.
Tn his cover story on the Church of
England in Australia in this issue,
Patrick Tennison places his finger on
one of the weakest points of that
Church—the educational standard of
its clergy. Most Anglican ministers at
work today, he points out, did not
reach matriculation standard at school,
and although they have obtained a
Th.L degree after three years at a
theological college, the entrance re-
quirements for these colleges have
been low and the Th.L is not well
regarded in universities.
This unsatisfactory state of affairs
goes some way towards explaining why
so many of the Anglican clergy have
often failed to discuss the issues raised
throughout the world in contemporary
theological debates which are of
the greatest general importance (they
simply do not understand them); and
why they have failed to provide
leadership on all sorts of pressing
social and political matters (they
simply do not know enough).
The Archbishop of Canterbury has
often made the point that the Church
has not been losing touch with the
people, but that the people have simply
been falling away from the standards
of the Church. It cannot be over-
emphasised that the Churches do not
exist to cater for all the country’s
demands, however anti-Christian, but
the point remains that a Church which
is satisfied with low intellectual stan-
dards is not only losing touch with
the people but with Christianity itself.
One may at least hope that the
visit of the Archbishop of Canterbury,
himself formerly a distinguished
scholar and academic, will provoke
the sort of soul-searching and reform
that the Church needs.


THIS AUSTRALIA
FEDERAL PARLIAMENT
Develop or Defend
Paltridge versus Fairbairn
CANBERRA —An old argument has
been revived in the Federal Cabinet
about how priorities should be allocated
between formal defence —ships, planes,
guns and soldiers and the form of
defence strength which emerges from
economic development. The argument
has produced muted rumbles likely to
grow louder as time passes. Already
Defence Minister Senator Shane Palt-
ridge and National Development Minister
David Fairbairn have revealed in the
Cabinet room that their views are highly
divergent.
Paltridge takes the view that develop-
ment, on the scale contemplated and
fostered, has to be sacrificed to formal
defence. Where Australia could once
take a risk and develop at the expense
of formal defence, building up its long-
term defence as against its short-term
capacity, it could not longer afford to
do so. The situation in South-East Asia
where Australia had accepted commit-
ments, that meant that a brake had to
be placed on development, was such that
nobody could forecast the near, never
mind the distant, future with confident
accuracy.
By Alan Reid
Paltridge apparently holds to his view
with some intensity and is prepared to
fight for it. At a recent Cabinet meeting
he is reported to have “savaged” the
National Development Minister David
Fairbairn over proposals advanced by
Fairbairn for the indirect form of defence
which comes from development. Fair-
bairn wanted money for this develop-
ment. Paltridge wanted the money for
his ships, guns and soldiers, and insisted
that the need for them was so immediate
and urgent that the claims of develop-
ment must temporarily lapse.
Fairbairn, 48, energetic and appointed
to his present portfolio because those
qualities were just the ones that would
secure a speed-up, particularly of north-
ern development which has lagged behind
development elsewhere during the Men-
zies years of office,
could be fighting a losing battle. Palt-
ridge has the ear of the Prime Minister.
He is in a position to proffer views which
nobody in the Cabinet can rebut first
hand.
Overtones of the Cabinet argument
were present in a Senate debate last
week. Senator Cant (Labor, WA) moved
the adjournment of the Senate to
complain about the Commonwealth’s
dilatoriness in dealing with the applica-
tion by the West Australian Liberal
Government for Federal financial assist-
ance to complete the major works on
the Ord River which is a northern
development project.
sounded genuinely puzzled. Here
was a project to which the Prime
Minister Sir Robert Menzies, when he
opened the diversion dam at Kununurra
in July, 1963, had given his seemingly
uninhibited blessing. Dr Rex Patterson,
director of the northern division of the
Department of National Development—
a division deliberately set up by the
Menzies Government to give added
impetus to the northern development
programme—had gone on public record
as being 100 per cent in favor of the
completion of the project. The applica-
tion of the WA Government was for
£30,000,000 spread over 15 years (the
highest amount required to be paid out
by the Commonwealth in any one year
of the 15 years would be £2,900,000).
“But nothing has been done,” said Cant.
In sections of his reply, Paltridge gave
the impression that he was addressing
his Cabinet colleagues who differ with
him on this concept of the priority that
should be accorded formal defence, as
well as Cant and the Senate.
Said Paltridge: “I say to the Senate,
with a real sense of sobriety, that today
we are undertaking defence expenditure
of a magnitude which far exceeds any-
thing that was previously necessary in
peacetime. As the Minister for Defence,
with, I hope, a proper sense of responsi-
bility towards my job, I think I am bound
to say that the fact that defence expendi-
ture must necessarily have priority might
well, in the course of time, impose limita-
tions on other forms of expenditure and
development which up to this time we
have regarded as just in the ordinary
nature of things. But Senator Cant,
despite this huge expenditure on defence,
is prepared not to regard expenditure on
the developmental project in question in
the context of total Government expendi-
ture.”
S. PALTRIDGE
D. E. FAIRBAIRN
There is a strong possibility that the
argument will be resolved in favor of
formal defence with development rele-
gated, temporarily at least, to a secondary
place.
ABORIGINES
Don’t Take
the Lake
The nearest thing to home
MELBOURNE Last week Mel-
bourne was offered the unique spectacle
of a Member of the British Empire and
Justice of the Peace picketing Parliament
House. Pastor Doug Nicholls, MBE, JP,
led eight other part-Aborigines in a pro-
test on the steps of the House against
the Government's policy on the Lake
Tyers’ Aboriginal settlement. They car-
ried placards declaring “Lake Tyers is
our birth place. Don't steal this as well”,
“Land Rights for Aborigines”, “Retain
Lake Tyers”, “Secure a land tenure for
Aborigines”.
The pickets, who dwindled to three
after an hour of demonstration, also
included the Aboriginal baritone Harold


Blair, who stood as an ALP candidate
at the last State elections in opposition to
the then Chairman of the Aborigines’
Welfare Board, Mr E. R. Meagher, MLA.
The protest was organised after the
Chief Secretary, Mr Rylah, announced
that his Government intended to close
the Lake Tyers settlement and resettle
its 100 Aborigines in towns in Gipps-
land.
Both the Government and the Abori-
gines’ Welfare Board believe that most of
the families at Lake Tyers would like to
be rehoused in places where there are
better economic opportunities. It is also
likely that they feel the depressed Lake
Tyers’ settlement is an open target for
public criticism and that a dispersal of
its Aborigines throughout the State will
remove not so much the problem, as the
appearance of a problem.
Like most people who have visited the
Lake Tyers’ station, Government leaders
and the AWB are appalled at the
squalor of the place, at the lack of ini-
tiative of the Aborigines, and the general
untidiness of it all.
Whether a policy of dispersal and
assimilation will be any better is immedi-
ately open to doubt. The Board itself
reported in 1963 that some Aborigines
are not equipped for life “outside” be-
cause “their life at Lake Tyers has been
ordered for them and. the residents have
no training in making decisions for
themselves. They continue to be .de-
pendent”. And the fact remains that
with all its hygienic, social, and economic
drawbacks the Lake Tyers’ reserve is
the birthplace of most of the Aborigines
in eastern Victoria. It remains a social
and familiar centre for many who have
moved away, the nearest thing they have
to “home”.
The demonstrating Aborigines would
like to see their kinsmen in better cir-
cumstances than Lake Tyers, but they
fear that if the Government closes the
reserve it will subdivide it for the settle-
ment of white farmers and the last area
of land the Aborigines have in Victoria
will be lost. It is possible that the de-
monstrators, with the support of the
Churches and the Press, may have forced
the Government to abandon its plans to
sell the land. But the Lake Tyers’ re-
serve in its present state is certainly
doomed.
TELEVISION
A Lost Week-end?
Only blood, sweat and tears
SYDNEY In the dying moments
of the National Television Congress,
author Frank Hardy found himself in
what he said was a strange position.
Here he was, a Communist, following
a speaker who was a member of the
Liberal Party and a QC, Mr Edward St
John, and agreeing with him to ensure
a unanimous resolution. Before the
Congress was a seven-part resolution
meant to summarise the conclusions of
320 delegates who claimed to represent
543.000 members. They had been
meeting in the Grace Auditorium over the
weekend to discuss the implementation
of the Vincent Report the report of
the Senate Select Committee on the
encouragement of Australian productions
for television.
The clause of contention read: “That
the Federal Government has failed in its
trust in that having tabled the report in
October, 1963, and having adjourned
debate in April, 1964, it has taken no
further steps to complete the parliamen-
tary discussions, or to correct the abuses
and defects pointed out in the report.”
After debate, delegates accepted an
amendment moved by Mr St John
deleting the words “has failed in its
trust” and substituting the words “it is
highly regrettable” later in the same
clause.
The resolution, which was eventually
passed unanimously, also said that the
future of Australia, its rights and liberties
depended in large part on the responsible
use of mass communications, especially
television; that the television wavelengths
were public property to be used for
public benefit; that the Vincent Report
was a “clear and objective record of
defects and abuses” with recommenda-
tions for correcting them; that the
Federal Government should debate the
report with a view to “remedial action”;
that the Prime Minister and Postmaster-
General had a special duty in the matter;
and that every individual Australian
should join a publicity campaign to
arouse interest in mass communications.
The resolution, like the Congress itself,
has turned out to be non-specific. An-
other resolution which led to sharply
divided opinions proposed the setting up
of a National TV Committee whose job
it would be to follow up the work of
the Congress and to seek parliamentary
discussion on the Vincent Report, as
well as arousing public interest in the
general statement of the Congress.
It was also to act as “observer and
critic of television services and to be
“a co-ordinator of the efforts of those
who have at heart the improvement of
Australian television”. Its proposed
members were 16 men and two women,
mainly academics, churchmen, and rep-
A. E. MONK
resentatives of unions and associations
in the television and film industry. Les
Haylen was the only “political” member.
No sooner was the imbalance of the sexes
made clear than the chairman, ACTU
president Mr Albert Monk, found a
rash of women’s hands raised all over
the hall. Women delegates protested
vehemently. “A typical piece of Vic-
torian male impertinence,” said one. Her
fellow delegates clapped and cheered.
Their demands threatened the passage
of the resolution, and it took a com-
promise suggested by author Morris
West to satisfy them. Moving that the
committee be required to co-opt at least
five women delegates, he orated: “This
is a critical moment. We have worked
together for a common purpose with a
common spirit. If we were to fail to
move this resolution now it would be
a strange motion of non-trust in our-
selves.” The way ahead for the TV
Committee, he warned grimly, “was full
of blood, sweat and tears”.
As on previous occasions when he
had spoken, Mr West was lustily ap-
plauded. Without question, even if in
a “father-figure” sort of way, he had by
twilight on Sunday come to dominate
the Congress.
With the exception of Mr R. Newton,
QC, who argued that the Vincent Report
was wrong to recommend the introduc-
tion of another instrumentality (a TV
Council to advise the PMG), they dis-
cussed, nearly always fully supporting, a
whole range of issues raised in the report.
At the end of the Congress someone
asked: “Has it been a lost week-end?”
If it was not a lost week-end it was cer-
tainly a one-sided one. The organisers
had not invited the managers of any tele-
vision station in Australia, national or
commercial, to attend the Congress.
None of the lecturers, with the exception
of Mr Newton, said anything in favor of
Australian television or gave the case
of the managements. It was a case of
being found guilty in absentia.
SAM LIPSKI


MOUNT ISA
Copped It
“Just don’t turn up again ”
PAT MACKIE
F. BISCHOF
MOUNT ISA This Queensland
wilderness township last week was a field
on which two “armies” advanced, re-
treated and wheeled to the orders of their
“generals”. On one side were 75 police,
and on the other, 250 pickets, miners,
their wives and families. But no shots
were fired; nor was there any real
violence.
Commanding the police contingent was
the controversial Police Commissioner
Frank Bischof and, of course, leading the
miners was the baseball-hatted, cauli-
flower - eared, New Zealand - born Pat
Mackie. While Mackie directed his
pickets from his red Mini-Cooper car,
Commissioner Bischof stood outside the
main entrance to the mine.
Commissioner Bischof, his powers to
handle the idle miners boosted by an
anti-Picketing Bill rushed through State
Parliament last week in a day, won the
battle. First the police used shock tac-
tics. They arrested four pickets for
allegedly refusing to obey a police order
to disperse, then like sheep dogs, the
police moved the remaining pickets in a
herd back a mile to the Mount Isa shop-
ping centre. And in contrast to their
belligerent attitude of the past few
months, the pickets did act like sheep.
This mellowing, no doubt, was caused
by the positiveness of the baton-equipped
police on the one hand, and the penal-
ties under the anti-Picketing Bill on the
other. The penalties for breaches of the
Bill: a fine of up to £lOO and up to
six months’ gaol; or both.
When news of the Bill reached Mount
Isa, Mackie was reported to have said
that it would be defied. This pointed at
some dramatic offensive by the miners
the next day as AWU miners, sickened
by the strike, returned to work. Mackie’s
contribution was to drive up to the mine
gate twice in his car. The second time
police said, “Just don’t turn up again”.
Mackie did not. His comment later:
“No comment. But we might as well
be in South Africa.”
The anti-Picketing Bill followed a
claim by the State President of the AWU,
Mr Gerry Goding, that picketing was a
form of intimidation. And those miners
who had returned to work, or who had
weakened in their resolve when in sight
of the mine gates, agreed with Mr
Goding. So did the Government.
rp-HE Queensland public, long critical of
-*■ the Government's far from positive
handling of the seven-month-long costly
dispute, welcomed the Bill. Last week
there were indications that the dispute
could end in four to five weeks, as The
Bulletin reported. The presence of
Commissioner Bischof and police flown
from both Brisbane and Cloncurry into
Mount Isa, however, could lop a week
off this figure.
The Left-wing Queensland Trades and
Labor Council late last week talked of
fighting back against the Government’s
“police state” legislation with a 24-hour
State-wide strike of all unions affiliated
with the Council. Meanwhile the size of
the workforce at the Mount Isa mine
continued to grow towards the 600—
including roughly 300 AWU members.
The day does not seem far distant
when the AWU will call a mass meet-
ing to vote on a return to work. The
meeting looms closer as Mackie slowly
but steadily slips from power.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA
The Lottery
Referendums on social questions
ADELAIDE -■— The new Labor Gov-
ernment in South Australia, having
announced Its intention to abolish the
death penalty and flogging and not to
recommend any more knighthoods, now
shows signs of adopting a democratic
method of deciding social questions
which was virtually unknown in 32 years
of Liberal rule. The new Government
has reaffirmed its election promise to hold
a referendum this year on whether South
Australia should have a State lottery.
South Australians, who live in the only
mainland State without a lottery, send
thousands of pounds interstate each year
for lottery tickets.
(Former Premier Sir Thomas Playford
disliked lotteries so intensely he even
had the word banned from publication.
Lucky South Australians whose illegal
interstate investments paid off had
“windfalls”. New Premier Frank Walsh
put “lotteries” back into the newspapers
during the election campaign.)
Having committed his new Govern-
ment to one referendum, Mr Walsh has
now revealed that he would like to see
referendums on the extension of liquor
trading hours and the TAB. He says:
“It would 'be desirable to know the
people’s views.”
He has given an assurance that the
Government will not participate in dis-
cussions for or against a State lottery
and presumably this condition would
apply to any other referendums.
Premier Walsh says that if it becomes
the Government's policy to hold refer-
endums on all social questions, it will
use its own discretion on when they will
be held and whether there will be more
than one. The State ALP convention in
June is expected to recommend that a
referendum should be held on a number
of social questions simultaneously.

NEW GUINEA
No Business as Usual
Waiting for the economic take-off
MELBOURNE Despite the World
Bank Report on New Guinea, Australia
still does not have a clearly formulated
policy to encourage private investment
in Papua and New Guinea, said Mr
F. M. Hewitt, MLC, in Melbourne last
week. Mr Hewitt, a director of Australia
New Guinea Corporation Limited, was
speaking at a seminar organised by
the Council for New Guinea Affairs.
The most welcome step taken by the
New Guinea Administration so far,- he
said, has been the Pioneer Industry
legislation which completely exempts
from Territory income tax any enterprise
granted a “Pioneer Certificate”. But
much more than this is needed.
Mr Hewitt outlined a five-plank policy:
1. Taxation Policy. More should be
done in reducing the writing-off period
for depreciation, in the field of undistri-
buted profits, and in increasing special in-
vestment allowances.
2. Tariff Policy. The Territory has
no tariff policy. Tariffs have been viewed
almost wholly as revenue producers.
“Tariff policy means much more than
this,” he said. “It means/the formula-
tion of conditions on which the Territory
will grant to industries tariff protection
from imported competitors. Such condi-
tions will be based on the value of the
industry to the Territory’s development
measured in terms of the employment
opportunities provided, the need for the
goods or services produced in the event
of emergencies, the amount of local re-
sources used, the amount of imports
avoided, the possibility for development
of exports. It means, also, a willingness
to pass up income in the short-term for
longer-term development of resources. It
means the establishment of a Tariff
Board or Committee.”
3. Land Policy. “Recently, a com-
pany decided to commence operations
in the Territory. Preliminary negoti-
ations were completed, land was select-
ed, the rigmarole of public tender
was successfully hurdled. The general
manager visited the Territory to complete
formalities, sign the appropriate docu-
ments and annoufice the new industry to
the Press. At the last moment, when re-
leases were already in the Press, the
Department of Civil Aviation decided
that this particular type of industry would
be unsuitable for the land allotted. It
used oxy-welding equipment in some
stages of its process and this would inter-
fere with air-navigational devices at the
airport nearby. Now, if the industry
goes ahead, the whole land procedure
must start again. This is not an isolated
instance frustrating experiences by
would-be investors are all too common.
One cannot blame the Department of
Civil Aviation for wanting to protect air
navigation. The air safety record in the
Territory is something of which we can
all be proud. But it is possible to blame
a system which causes concern for air
safety to materialise at such a late stage.”
4. Power Policy. “In association with
the establishment of industrial estates,
some thought might be given to the
charges for power in the Territory,
which in any language are extremely
high.”
5. Finance. At the moment, the bulk
of the burden of financing private in-
vestment (apart from equity capital) is
shouldered by the Australian banking
system. It is doubtful if, in their pre-
sent form, the banks can do all that
needs to be done to finance the future.
Mr Hewitt agreed with the World Bank
on the need for an enterprising develop-
ment finance institution.
Mr Hewitt concluded: “I do not sub-
scribe to the view that the whole pro-
blem of developing industry belongs to
government, but it should create a
favorable economic climate and develop
the infrastructure necessary for private
development. From then on, private
industry must push its own barrow.”
LICENSING LAWS
Drinking:
Part I
An end to clock-watching
MELBOURNE The days of Vic-
toria's “six o’clock swill” are numbered
and the Chief Secretary, Mr Rylah, may
well usher in the spring by introducing
legislation to extend drinking hours to
10 p.m. When that happens, it will be
due in large part to the -work done by
a self-confessed “confirmed, if moderate”,
drinker, Mr P. D. Phillips, QC, the liquor
Royal Commissioner.
Part 1 of his report was a taste of
things to come in Part 2, which will
be tabled in State Parliament before
Easter. It was a report which cleared
the way for the introduction of later
trading hours, which Mr Phillips is cer-
tain to recommend in Part 2. Eighty-
two pages long with a 169-page appen-
dix, the report was tabled by Mr Rylah
A. G. RYLAH
who found it “most interesting and com-
prehensive”.
The report covers the relationship
between liquor and road and industrial
accidents, delinquency and other social
problems. It makes no specific recom-
mendations but does lead to some general
suggestions.
In dealing with the sociological effects
of alcohol, Mr Phillips has performed a
debunking job on some widely held
myths and has drawn attention to some
undeniably serious problems. He was
quite definite that total consumption of
liquor would not be increased by an
extension of hotel hours to 10 p.m., or
that this would lead to more drunken-
ness-or traffic accidents. If anything, he
suggested that the experience of other
States was that there could be a slight
decrease in traffic risks if there was no
“pressure to drink against the clock”.
But Mr Phillips was just as definite
that the unwise consumption of alcohol
had a real connection with motor acci-
dents, and recommended new laws en-
forced with suitable penalties for motor-
ists who drove with a blood alcohol
content of more than .05 per cent. With-
out a meal, this meant that an average
person could have seven or eight drinks,
without having more than three or four
an hour, and stay within the .05 alcohol
content. To drink more than this was to
be “selfish, reckless and anti-social”.
Some long-held and widely cherished
beliefs about alcohol were demolished
by Mr Phillips. There was no evidence
that drinking caused heavy industrial
losses; it was not a serious enough factor
in crime to justify special action, it was
not a serious factor in the growth of
juvenile delinquency, it was difficult to
determine whether drink destroyed mar-
riages or whether unhappy marriages led
to drink. Just what the real social costs
of alcoholism and excessive consumption
of alcohol were to the community was a
subject for research and investigation.
There was far too much ignorance about
drinking and its effects.

THE ECONOMY
“Yankee, Come Back!”
No panic
MELBOURNE The Australian cli-
mate for foreign investors thawed last
week when it dawned even on their most
redoubtable critics that our balance of
payments could be undermined by new
US measures designed to curb capital
exports to developed countries (includ-
ing Australia) and to get bigger repatria-
tions of overseas investment income.
The swiftest reaction came from the
Federal Government, stung by the fact
that Japan and Canada had been ex-
empted from the moves. The Prime
Minister’s letter to the President bore
an injured strain. Mr McEwen, the
Minister for Trade and Industry, gave
the stock answer that everything would
be all right if exporters would only get
really cracking, if international com-
modity agreements could be negotiated
and if the US lowered its trade barriers.
“For all its advantages,” he said, “the
inflow of overseas capital is unpredict-
able and holds inherent risks for Aus-
tralia’s economic growth and balance of
payments.” Much to Dr Cairns’s satis-
faction, Mr H. Holt, the Federal Trea-
surer, admitted as much, according to
Cairns, for the first time in Parliament.
Mr Holt gave the measure of the
problem. Capital inflow from the US
last year was about equal to that from
H. HOLT
DR J. F. CAIRNS
Britain, the two countries together pro-
viding about £197 million of the £215
million coming in. Obviously, while
Britain is wrestling with a mammoth
balance of payments problem and its
capital outflow is uncertain (if not yet
being restricted), the implications of a
reduced flow from the US could be very
serious. However, with our overseas re-
serves £794 million at the end of Feb-
ruary, only £6O million or so down after
eight months of trade deficits, the situ-
ation did not call for panic measures.
Talk of reprisals to prevent foreign-
owned firms raising fixed interest capital
in Australia got short shrift from Mel-
bourne financier Mr Arthur Goode.
Such loans were, from the balance of
payments’ viewpoint, preferable to bring-
ing in fixed capital from overseas be-
cause interest payments on them went
to Australians, he said.
Mr Goode continued: “Even when the
whole of the equity is owned outside
Australia, it is still a development for
us to be providing a great deal more of
the fixed interest finance here. The
Australian capital market is now big
enough to handle all these demands, and
this is the first time this could be said
with complete confidence.”

COMMUNISTS
At the Front
On to Algiers
SYDNEY It is the season again for
Communist Party “fronts”. The main
front of course is the World Peace
Council. The Australian peace movement
is an integral part of the WPC, to whose
meeting at Warsaw in March it will be
sending a delegate, probably the Chair-
man Dr A. G. Lawes. Closely following
the WPC in importance is the World
Federation of Trade Unions, a front so
blatant that the Australian Council of
Trade Unions instructed all Australian
unions to withdraw their affiliations. The
Women’s International Democratic Fed-
eration provides the front for women's
organisations. The Union of Australian
Women is a part of the WIDF; indeed
the UAW’s national secretary, CPA cen-
tral committee member Mrs F. Brown, is
a vice-chairman of WIDF.
These fronts are now preparing to
throw their weight behind the two other
fronts that are about to assail us the
World Federation of Democratic Youth
and the International Union of Students.
So complex do these fronts become that
WFDY and lUS will make their ap-
proach through yet another front, “The
Preparatory Sponsoring Committee for
the Ninth Youth Festival for Peace and
Friendship”, the festival due to be held
in Algiers during July/August of this
year.
The Communist Party’s youth organi-
sation, the Eureka Youth League, which
is allied to WFDY, will manage the main
proceedings, but once again through
another front, “The National Sponsoring
Committee”. The headquarters of this
sponsoring committee in NSW are at
421 Sussex Street, Sydney, which happens
to be the address of the NSW Peace
Committee.
It is from here that a screed has gone
out stating that in Sydney more than 20
people have decided to initiate activity in
support of the festival. Included amongst
these are the Reverend A. Brand, chair-
man of the Peace Committee, Mr Kevin
Butcher, folk singer, Mr Tony Barber,
waterside worker and Australian Olympic
boxing representative, Mr Tom Supple,
vice-president of the Sydney Waterside
Workers who last year attended the
World Youth Forum for Freedom and
Peace in Moscow, and Mrs Mavis Robert-
son, national secretary of the EYL and a
leading Communist.
The letter failed to state that an Aus-
tralian has already gone to Algiers to help
in the preparations for the festival. This
is a Mr Ogden, a Victorian state council-
lor of the EYL. Mr Ogden was spon-
sored by the Commonwealth Council of
his union, the Amalgamated Engineering
Union. His route to Algiers remains
unknown.

DEVELOPMENT
Land
Speculators
£3 an acre
PERTH A storm is building up in
the West around speculation by non-
resident investors in land opened up for
farm development. The first breeze
started blowing early last month at the
Farmers’ and Scientists’ conference in
Perth when Dandaragan Shire Councillor
W. A. Slee claimed that 60 per cent of
the people holding farms in his area
were not living on them.
Surveyor J. F. Morgan told Mr Slee
that he felt the figures were misleading
and erroneous, but a recent survey of the
shire showed that since 1952 only 38 per
cent of the virgin blocks opened up in
the Dandaragan Shire are lived on by the
owners. Of the rest, 62 per cent are non-
residents, and of these half live in dis-
tant country areas —though not neces-
sarily are all farmers—and 28 per cent
live in the city.
VTothing is more likely to stir the
farmers’ feelings than the thought of
city landholders sitting back and making
capital out of the 1,000,000-plus acres
being opened up each year in Western
Australia. Land allocated on conditional
purchase goes for only a few shillings
per acre (the last sale brought between
9s. and 165.), but soon appreciated to
around £3 an acre; adjacent blocks
worked by resident owners lift the value
of the whole newly developed area.
Mr Slee's claim evoked a great deal -of
support among farmers throughout the
State, andjast week a University of WA
survey team found that Lands Depart-
ment records on this issue were not read-
ily available to the public “in case land-
holders were open to pestering by con-
tractors”.


Is the C. of E. in a Mess?
The Church with a touch of Shinto
By PATRICK TENNISON
a certain amount of
Shinto in the Church of England
here,” one of its clerics confided
to me. “Just about anything is possible.
We’ll bury anyone.” And take it any
way you like, his remark seemed fitting
for an organisation that contains an ex-
traordinary number of quite blatant
contradictions.
Today, with murmurings of every-
thing from science to ecumenism in the
religious air, every Christian denomi-
nation is undergoing some process of
unrest. But in the Anglican Church in
Australia the struggles are far acuter,
noisier, and more public than in any
other Church.
“Unlike all the others, we’ve never
been strong on loyalty to our Church
as such,” one member tried to explain.
“Our loyalties have always been directly
to Christ and the scriptures first, the
Church second.” And, naturally, many
Anglicans will argue that it is good for
a Church to contain differences. Therein
can lie part of its all-embracing strength.
“Non-Anglicans would go off and join a
different Church, but we invariably stay
faithful Anglicans,” is a regularly heard
argument.
How much should a Church be exa-
mined and in what ways?
Take membership. The 1961 Aus-
tralian census showed that C of E was
the religion claimed by 3,668,921
people—or 35 per cent of the popula-
tion. Yet the same census showed that
in the previous year C of E marriage
services totalled 20,993 or less than
28 per cent of all marriages performed.
From this it is obvious that thousands
of Anglicans each year prefer to be
married in non-Anglican churches —■
presumably the one of their different-
religioned marriage mates or else have
religionless civil ceremonies.
Another investigation has revealed
that only 13 per cent of self-proclaiming
Anglicans attend church weekly, com-
pared with 31 per cent of Methodists
and 54 per cent of Roman Catholics.
No other denomination has a lower
attendance score than Anglicans.
Devoutness aside, on the numbers
alone the position of Anglicanism as
Australia’s biggest denomination is now
being threatened. Despite a 10 per
cent lead in numbers over Catholics, if
present trends continue, within 20 years
Australia’s biggest religion will be
Catholicism.
Under-staffing is another problem.
Australia’s Anglican population is the
same size as the Episcopalian popula-
tion of the United States. Yet we have
only 25 diocesan bishops, compared with
America’s 78. We have 1500 Anglican
priests, they have 8900.
“The majority of churchgoers today
are middle-aged and old people who
regard the Church as security—a fine
insurance job,” one harassed suburban
priest explained. “It’s not relevant to
young people or to the important
changes in the pattern of living. Breadth
of visions has increased, but the
Church hasn’t kept pace. We’re way
behind. The trouble is that we haven’t
yet got to grips completely with what
happened in the industrial revolution.”
Despite falterings on church school
aid decisions, financial affairs and dras-
tic moves to revise the Prayer Book,
Sydney diocese stands out as the most
dynamic in Australia. Militantly Low
Church, Sydney can claim higher figures
in seminarians, can make greater de-
mands on congregations and is, all told,
better and more compactly organised
than any other Australian diocese,
A non-Sydney priest explained it:
“They score because theologically they
are in a position of authority. They
demand! They are as bad in their way
as Rome ever was. But Billy Graham
types of conversion are a benefit in
Sydney.”
In the old High-Low controversy, it
is Sydney v. the rest of the country as
far as Sydney’s Low Church practices
and outlook are concerned. Few if any
dioceses in the world equal its con-
servative evangelicism. “It’s so Low it’s
not Anglican,” some critics grin. Mel-
bourne is more polyglot, but on the
Low side of centre with a High Church
movement at present ascendant. (High-
Low battles are strenuous, running even
to. “how to vote” tickets being circulated
in Synod.) Brisbane, like all Queens-
land, is a solid block of Anglo-Catholi-


cism; Adelaide is pretty uniformly High,
with roughly an 80 per cent show of
vestments on Sundays; Perth rides on
the High side of middle; Tasmania
is confusedly mixed.
These differences from capital to
capital, State to State, carry on for
generations and are the fruit of earlier
leaders who showed these leanings.
Interstate rivalries do much to cement
a particular outlook solidly into more
or less permanent place.
Few things amuse intelligent Angli-
cans more than outsiders’ puzzlement at
their High-Low differences. These
differences do not cause disruption or
even much concern. It is an inevitable
part of Anglican structure that unani-
mity on such points is in no way vital.
The very nature of the Australian
Church allows this: it exists as a group
of. autonomous regional Churches, all
having the same heritage, similar liturgy
and doctrine, but with each free to ex-
press itsqlf in terms of the culture or
surroundings in which it finds itself. It
was only late in 1961 that it was decided
to take up this national autonomy free
from the former control of England.
As it was, this finally came 130 years
after Canada and New Zealand had re-
ceived their autonomy. In Australia,
autonomy was first discussed about the
same time—back in the 1830 s when the
first Bishop of Australia, Bishop
Broughton, was resident. When Bishop
Broughton died, his successor was a
royal supremicist who opposed the
whole idea of autonomy so it was drop-
ped. So for nearly 130 years it was
cessively taken up and dropped until the
final breakthrough in 1961.
Similarly, then as now, division has
existed on the name of the Australian
Church. The Church of England in
Australia and Tasmania was the name
given it over considerable opposition
and, as a name, it stands out among
other Churches around the world that
are in the international Anglican com-
munion. All the others have far simpler
titles, such as The Anglican Church of
Canada, The Episcopal Church of the
United States, The Church of the Pro-
vince of East Africa. Within the Bri-
tish Isles, the nomenclature is simplicity
itself with The Church of England, The
Church in Wales, The Church of Ire-
land and The Episcopal Church in
Scotland.
Despite autonomy, strong inclinations
continue among clergy and laymen to
continue to look towards England for
example, leadership and leaders. In
many ways the thought domination of
England is as strong as Roma|i authority
is for Catholics.
English influence is most clearly seen
in the way Australian synods persist in
calling in English bishops, particularly
archbishops. The reason lies in the well-
entrenched belief that English clerics
are better trained and come to the job
better equipped. Mixed with this, too,
is a lingering snobbish reverence for
English university letters after a cleric’s
name. This reverence is in fact more
than just snobbishness. There is near-
universal agreement that Australian
theological training is inferior to the
English brand.
Australians predominate as provincial
bishops and as assistants mainly because
in such posts synods feel it is more im-
portant to have pastors who are close to
their people. But metropolitan areas
want something more.
Back in Bishop Broughton’s 1830 s,
the only theological training introduced
here was what was called (and some
still call) a “peasants’ course”. (Still
remembered is the bishop who defended
the present status quo by claiming that
it was impossible to teach medieval
theology in Australia because we lacked
the medieval atmosphere that was so
strong in England!)
Th.L. in low repute
VTumerically, Australia does not lack
theological colleges. There is one in
each State capital, plus several others:
in New South Wales at Morpeth; in
Victoria at Wangaratta and, in addition,
Melbourne University's Trinity College
takes some students and Perry Hall
takes married men with families; in
South Australia at Crafers, outside
Adelaide.
But even in theological training the
High-Low bugbear can cause certain
difficulties. For instance, Sydney’s
Moore College is, like the Sydney dio-
cese, extremely Low Church. A candi-
date with High Church leanings there-
fore would have a disinclination to go
there for training. So, as happens quite
frequently, seminarians have to travel
far, sometimes interstate, to study at the
college most amenable to their own
leanings. This is a physical strain that
no other denomination imposes on its
ministerial volunteers.
Once in, the candidate usually does
only the regular Th.L. course which in-
volves only three years of training. Is
this sufficient when you consider, for
instance, that there is no Catholic priest
in the field with less than seven years’
seminary training? On top of this,
although most theological colleges are
trying to raise the entry requirement to
matriculation level, the vast majority of
Anglican ministers at work today are
products of the earlier times when a
school leaving certificate was sufficient
to gain entry for training.
In Australia at least, the locally ob-
tained Th.L. is not highly regarded by
our universities. In fact a priest armed
with only a Th.L. will find himself un-
acceptable to any Australian university
unless he has also matriculated. One
way of looking at this is that since 80
per cent of our Anglican clergy have
only a Th.L., 80 per cent of our Angli-
can clergy are educated only to sub-
matriculation standard—at least in uni-
versity eyes. Paradoxically, this view
does not hold overseas as it is possible
for Th.L. holders to do B.A. courses at
Cambridge, and London University will
admit them to do the B.D.
Largely because of this, only 20 per
cent of our Anglican clergy has tackled
university courses. In more than
“medieval atmosphere” does England
offer greater chances for higher learn-
ing!
Recruiting of candidates for clerical
training has been most slack in the past.
But even today only two Australian
universities can show an Anglican chap-
lain on their campus. Most Anglican
schools have chaplains, of course, but the
axiom seems to be the better the school,
the poorer its efforts in keeping the
Church supplied with ministers. For
instance, Geelong Grammar School—
hailed by some as the nation’s “best”—
has produced only two Anglican priests
since 1938. Brighton Grammar in Mel-
bourne has done markedly better, yield-
ing three in the last 10 years. Melbourne
Grammar old boys in the Church are
believed to total a whole 10. Little
wonder one school chaplain was heard
to moan: “Our expensive church school
system produces far more atheists than
priests.” It is from the State school
systems that most candidates come, yet
this is the system with far less religious
influence of any sort.
Because it must ultimately reflect on
the men who lead the Church and,
through them, the Church itself, the dis-
mal and irregular standard of Austra-
lian theological training would seem to
be a root cause of much of the dissatis-
faction to do with Australian Anglican-
ism. As well as the High-Low differ-
ences, there are important geographic
reasons why the training at the various
colleges lacks any sort of uniformity
and cohesion. It is only recently that
the training at any of them has included
the philosophies of such latter day reli-
gious thinkers as Tillich, Bonhoeffer
and Bultman. Some colleges still exist
as if these men had not. At Melbourne’s
Ridley College they came under notice
officially for the first time only last year,
when a special seminar was held on a
lot of what is called the new thinking
and the whole “Honest to God” affair.
Another cause for complaint is that
Christian Ethics is only an optional
subject for the Th.L. and invariably
lacks a lecturer.
The very fact that Australia has so
many different colleges has frequently

been a source of criticism. It came
hard, for example, from America’s
Canon Howard Johnson in his book
“Global Odyssey”, which was a survey
of world Anglicanism following a global
tour he did in 1962. He wrote: “In
the day of the horse and buggy, these
many seminaries were a necessity. To-
day, however, regional pride is involved:
it would be humiliating to surrender a
single one of them. But the plain fact
is: Australia does not have enough
doctors of divinity to staff so many col-
leges adequately. Yet they go on, small
as they are, understaffed as they are,
with libraries so tiny and obsolete that
they made me weep. The obvious solu-
tion, it seems to me, is for many of
these colleges to join forces. By amal-
gamating teaching staff and libraries it
would be possible to produce a few
strong seminaries instead of a raft of
feeble ones.”
The Principal of Melbourne’s Ridley
College, the Rev. Canon Dr L. L.
Morris, confessed that he had not read
Canon Johnson’s book but agreed with
his notion of why we retain so many
seminaries: “Local patriotism always
enters into it. No one wants to close
Western Australia, for instance, although
possibly a good case could be made out
to close down some.”
The Morris questionnaire
T\r Morris returned to Australia last
year after two years as warden at
Tyndale House, Cambridge. Seeking ways
to improve Ridley’s training and
methods, he sent a questionnaire to
Melbourne’s 300 Anglican clergy; a
single printed sheet asking a dozen
questions that could be answered by
most in 15 minutes. Non-committally,
he revealed that he had received back
only 115. But the answers and com-
ments of that minority that did bother
to co-operate showed that considerable
discontent exists “in the field” about
theological training and the preparation
it gives.
To the question on whether they felt
they had received adequate instruction
in contemporary theological thought,
most replied “no”. It was “no” again
to a similar question about sufficient
preparation for pastoral skills. But
“yes” was the majority answer on
questions about whether training had
been sufficient in Bible knowledge and
Christian knowledge.
The answers also revealed a two-to-
one vote in favor of more seminars and
fewer lectures. To the question “Did
you receive sufficient help in your own
devotional life?” two-to-one replied
“no”. To the question “Was enough
attention given to preaching?” a solid
80 per cent said “no”. Asked what they
felt had been the main advantages they
had received from their training, most
mentioned the fellowship with other
students and the living together in the
college community.
On the general training pattern Dr
Morris admitted: “It can’t be said even
now that our recruiting is vigorous. We
run the Ridley Fellowship—a group of
men interested in the ministry—and in-
vite vicars to send along young men who
are interested. Matriculation is our
general entry standard now, although
not everyone has it. Earlier, matricu-
lation wasn’t even aimed at. But we
still like to keep the place open for men
with reasonable standards. I’ve got a
bloke coming this yejfir who is a
plumber.”
Putting it at its bluntest, to the out-
sider looking in at Australian Anglican-
ism it would all seem to be a mess. The
whole represents a picture of complex
enigma—insufficiently prepared or uni-
ted to face a modern, changing world,
foreign-led, its authority in the commu-
nity dwindling, its position as the major
Church slipping away, the frequent
charges of inefficient handling of internal
affairs.
Perhaps it would be a more thorough-
ly redoubtable organisation if, like its
English parent, it were Australia’s
Established Church, which it has no
great wish to be. Yet it still likes to
carry an aura of Establishmentarianism
about it, especially when taking the lead
at regal, vice-regal and official cere-
monials that require the faintest sort of
religious background. In these respects,
it is still the Church, though what will
happen when its numbers are overtaken,
as predicted, by Catholicism? (Pro-
bably, as we get closer to the American
pattern of Churches, we shall also fol-
low the American pattern of greater
competition and activity among
Churches with a resultant upward trend
in Anglican numbers.)
But even today, while it is still the
majority Church, it has far less power
politically than the Catholic Church on
one hand and the non-conformists on
the other. Where Catholics have been
most active, vocal and generally united
on the question of State Aid for schools,
Anglicans have played a far smaller
role individually or as a group. Their
disunity, in fact, was shown up badly
in Sydney when Synod went directly
counter to the Primate’s wishes. On
Australia’s perennial squabbles about
drinking, gambling and vice, it is the
Methodists and Presbyterians who have
shown most unity, spoken in the loud-
est voices. Governments are scared of
the non-conformists whenever issues
like these appear. Governments are
wary of the Catholic vote on issues like
school aid. But how long is it since
any Government gave a hang about
what Anglicans thought? (“It’s really

the other way around,” a cynical Angli-
can vicar chuckled when this point came
up. “Our people are more interested
in what Governments think of them.
When have we ever gone against a
Government?”)
Traditionally, the Anglican Church
has always held that its people can and
must have vast freedom in their own
minds on extra-Church issues. This is
the thrpwback still from ancient castings
off of Roman authoritarianism. But in
the light of the Church's position today,
it seems to boil down to a question of
where great freedom ends and laissez
faire begins. Many deep-thinking Angli-
cans are worried. Dismiss the High-
Low rivalry, as some do, as “a simple
matter of haberdashery”, revel in the
freedom of expression, belief and action
denied other religions, but freedom
brings special responsibilities.
Four-wheelers
IV/lany Anglicans are now aware that
most of their fellow Church mem-
bers are “four-wheelers” who use the
Church only for baptism, marriage and
burial.
The Rev. Peter Hollingworth, one of
Melbourne’s (and Australia’s) most for-
ward-thinking Anglicans, put it: “In
Australia, the Church is not only dis-
established, it’s disengaged. There are
many major points on which it could
and should speak but doesn’t. The
White Australia policy, for instance.
The Church has spoken against it, but
on this and other topics the opinion is
often modified.”
Peter Hollingworth, like an in-
creasing number of his fellows, feels he
can better fulfil his life’s religious pur-
pose by getting away from straight
parish work. That is why he is today
chaplain to the charity organisation The
Brotherhood of St Lawrence.
Organisations like this one are a small
but significant indication of an in-
creasing awareness in the Church that
it must expand its work and frontiers.
In earlier generations it was never
strong on missionary work or proselyti-
sing of any sort. As the British Empire
expanded, churchmen who travelled to
distant horizons with it did little at first
to convert the heathen. It was strictly
a w'hite man’s Church and a British
white man at that. In the 17th century,
for instance, it is believed that only one
Hindu was baptised. Mission and
gospel propagating societies did come
later, but in Australia at least it was
only in this century, and then consider-
ably under the spur of competition from
other denominations, that mission work
on the mainland and, more recently, in
New Guinea generated much interest
among Anglicans.
Some clerics, such as the Rev. Max
Thomas, Chaplain to Melbourne Uni-
versity, see the Church’s brighter hopes
in work of this kind, especially as far as
the Australian Church is concerned and
especially in New Guinea. “Where it
has gone out to all the people and where
we have not just built an Australian
compound, it has been a big contribu-
tion to the people and to the Church
as well,” he said. “Maybe the rest of
the Church can take a lead from work
of this nature in other things it would
like to achieve.”
Such Christian charity should start
closer to home, according to the Rev.
Peter Thomson, Melbourne suburban
vicar and outspoken Australian disciple
of Bishop (“Honest to God”) Robinson.
He sees education as the much-needed
key: “Eighty-five per cent of Anglican
children go to State schools where they
get little or no Anglican training. For
our ministers there is an unbelievable
inadequacy of specialised theological
training at a post-graduate level. Look
at the lack of divinity faculties at Aus-
tralian universities. Melbourne Univer-
sity has provision for one, but because
of internal squabbling within the
Church it has been impossible for any-
one to go ahead.” (Peter Thomson is
one of the fortunate ones who has been
overseas —but he had to go at his own
expense.)
Still, out of the maelstrom come occa-
sional heartening signs. One was the
recent agreement between Anglicans
and Methodists at the Australian Coun-
cil of Churches meeting in Sydney to
sign a covenant with a view to the two
Churches uniting. There are also re-
portedly higher interest and attendances
at Anglican churches recently, although
it seems confined mainly to middle-class
areas.
The Anglican-Methodist projected
link is seen as an ecumenical gesture.
In their traditional broad-mindedness,
Anglicans are generally warm to ecu-
menical ideas —as long as they do not
involve any sort of takeover bid by the
Pope or the imposition of too many
restrictive trade practices by the non-
conformists. But broadly, Anglicans are
probably more willing than most to be
sounded out and 'sound out ideas on
possible unifying moves.
In all Churches, ecumenism has
aroused considerable interest and this
could, in part, account for increased
activity among middle-class Anglicans.
The middle-class distinction seems rele-
vant, especially in the light of the sober-
ing international situation. It is in fact
the' middle-class that js more intelli-
gently concerned and more likely to
respond rather than the apparently less
interested “lower classes” or the more
urbane upper classes.
Another factor must be a slightly
greater reaching out to people in the
context of religious interests within
parishes. The Christian Education De-
partment and the General Board of
Religious Education are trying hard to
stimulate greater interest with their
parish life missions. “These missions,” said
one vicar, “are going beyond Anglicanism
and raising good theological questions.”
That phrase again—“going beyond
Anglicanism”— could again have signifi-
cance. It may be that moves beyond
Anglicanism and towards ecumenism
might in the end provide new challenges
and concepts for the unusual admixture in
the Christian compendium that is Angli-
canism. Backed by some of the hard-
working self-developmental groups al-
ready in action, pushed along by the
keen, eager minds that are willing and
able to do more than circumstances now
allow, thrusting out into missionising of
all sorts among all classes and neighbor-
ing races, gradually Australian Angli-
canism might discover a newer, more
dynamic role to fulfil.
The Archbishop of Perth, the Most
Rev. George Appleton, a man widely
respected for his learning and travels,
seemed to seize hungrily on a similar
theme at the Council of Churches meet-
ing when the Anglican-Methodist unity
move came up. “Suddenly we have
come to a moment of unity and inspira-
tion on this question,” he said. “We
must not let unity and inspiration go.
Whatever happens in our own Church,
we must not lose this.”

Dr Gough Replies
For his survey on Australian Angli-
canism, Patrick Tennison submitted a
sories of questions on present-day Angli-
can matters to the Anglican Primate and
Archbishop of Sydney, the Most Rev.
H. Gough. Here are the questions
and the Primate's answers to them.
The Anglican Church in Australia is
frequently criticised both in the Press
and in books such as Canon Johnson’s
“Global Odyssey”. Can you indicate what
you believe to have been unjust criti-
cisms?
As regards Canon Johnson’s book, it
was most unfortunate that the Canon
toured Australia during the summer
holiday season and failed to meet many
of our leaders and to see much of the
most important features of the work of
the Church of England in Australia.
His account is quite inadequate and, in
part, incorrect. Here in Sydney he saw
none of our leaders in spite of our
efforts to arrange for him to do so. By
way of example I would mention his
astonishingly incorrect remarks about
our work for migrants. The Church of
England in Australia carries out a re-
markably fine work in this connection,
providing chaplains 'on the migrant
ships, welcome to migrants on arrival
in the various ports, clerical and lay
visitors to the migrant hostels and, in
some parishes, houses and flats are pro-
vided for Anglican migrants until they
can obtain their own accommodation.
Much of the criticism that appears
from time to time in the Press is due to
misunderstandings based upon ill-
informed sources and upon consultation
with Church people who are not in a
position to know the full facts (for
example, the religious syllabus in State
schools of NSW).
In what way would you yourself cri-
ticise the Australian Church?
(a) We are too concerned with our
own “local” problems which assume
gigantic size out of all proportion.
(b) A lack of unity between dioceses.
But there are happy signs that this is
being overcome.
(c) A tendency on the part of the
wealthier dioceses to ignore the needs
of those working in the outback. But,
again, special attention is being paid to
this problem now.
(d) We tend to be living behind the
times and to concern ourselves with
Church problems which are no longer
as relevant as they were. •
What is your reaction to suggestions
that the Church should be more active
directly in political affairs?
I am anxious that Church people
should take a more active part in politi-
cal affairs. I spoke at some length-about
this in my Presidential Address to our
Diocesan Synod in October, 1963, and,
in particular, urged our young people to
join the youth groups of the political
parties, to study politics and to consider
the possibility of taking up a political
career. I do not, however, approve of
the Church of England becoming iden-
tified with any one party nor of the
clergy taking an active share in party
politics.
Are you happy with the standard of
Anglican theological training in Aus-
tralia? . Would you like to see fewer
theological colleges?
The standard varies greatly from
good to bad. Many of our ordination
candidates in Sydney are now success-
fully taking the London BD degree
which is of high standard. I do not
favor fewer theological colleges. Some
are already too big in membership and
the men lose the value of personal friend-
ship with their experienced teachers.
In what ways (briefly) do you see the
Church here as differing from the
Church in the UK in its day-to-day
ministrations?
Too complex a question to answer
properly. One of the happy differences
is the far greater readiness in Australia
to try out new ventures and methods in
tackling problems; e.g., the “Every
Member Canvass” (or “promotion of
pledged giving of money”) was adopted
here several years before it was intro-
duced into England. It has transformed
the financial situation in many dioceses.
Do you believe we shall shortly have
Australian archbishops here and do you
consider this would be necessary or
desirable?
The archbishops are freely elected by
their own diocesan synods. If the dio-
ceses want Australians they can and
will have them! From what is often said,
it would appear that English bishops are
almost “forced” upon unwilling Austra-
lians! Whereas they are elected by Aus-
tralians of their own free will and the
Englishmen only accept if they 'are con-
vinced they are really wanted. Whilst
obviously it would be a good thing to
have some Australian archbishops, I be-
lieve it is a good thing in these modern
days for there to be an exchange between
countries. Why not Australian bishops in
England?
Can yon agree with the suggestion
that it is “easier” to be an Anglican
than to belong to any other Christian
denomination?
It is no easier to be a fully committed
and practising Anglican than to belong
to any other Christian denomination. In
fact I would judge it to be harder in
many cases.
Do you believe present differences
between High and Low churchmen are
in any vital way damaging to the fabric
of the Church?
The Anglican Communion tradition-
ally is comprehensive and allows for
wide difference of convictions amongst
her members. It does not believe in
compelling adherence to rigid and de-
tailed interpretations. It allows variety
of interpretation. The harm comes
when difference of conviction leads to
bitterness and ill-feeling. Such used to
exist but is becoming less and less com-
mon here as elsewhere. As long as
there is no such bitterness and narrow-
ness, difference of opinion need do no
harm and can be beneficial and allows
for that variety of temperament which
is so common.
What surprised you most about the
Church here in Australia when you
came?
Nothing! I found it verv similar to
what I was accustomed to in England. I
was pleased to find a greater generosity
of giving of money and a willingness to
tackle new problems.
Do you like publicity being given to
Church affairs in, for instance, an article
like this one I have been asked to write?
I appreciate the amount of space
given in the Press, both daily and
weekly, to Church affairs. But I am
concerned that so much of what is said
is incomplete. For example, I confess I
was much disappointed with Peter Has-
tings’ account in The Bulletin of his
recent interview with me! We had a really
interesting conversation! But in my judg-
ment he omitted to write of the im-
portant things.

AROUND MELBOURNE
Just an Anonymous Airport
Intervention of the UN forces?
HEhe ugly "New South Wales-Victoria
battle is about to break out again
and this time, judging from Melbourne
reactions, we may have to appeal for a
small United Nations force to prevent
hostilities. The Federal Government has
made no allocation of funds for the
building of terminal buildings at the new
Tullamarine airport!
We had an inkling that something evil
. was afoot when the Australian Industries
Fair opened at the Exhibition Building a
fortnight ago. The Department of Civil
Aviation built a very fancy working
model of Tullamarine. It showed the
multi-storey control tower. It showed
the terminal with restaurants, observa-
tion bars and all. Actually the main
terminal building was three-sided with
three long fingers which went out across
the apron. The big jets could nose into
these fingers. At the lower level the
aircraft were serviced, at the upper the
passengers could enter or leave the air-
craft without getting wet or ruffled.
But then what happened? The Fair
opened. There was still no approval of
the terminal buildings from the Parlia-
mentary Works Committee, so the DCA
couldn’t describe their working model as
Tullamarine. If you see it up there,
it’s just an anonymous airport.
You can appreciate the tragedy of it
all. Everything seemed so settled, so
perfect. It was only last September that
we had the brilliant “start work” cere-
mony. Contracts for runways, roads,
aprons and such had been let for
£5 V million. All the city and Parliamen-
tary dignitaries went out to Tullamarine.
A ribbon was erected. The Minister
for Public Works, Senator Gorton, got
his picture in the paper by driving
through it aboard a sizeable scraper.
We were told the jetport would be in
action by 1967.
We may have to wait years. We had
only one international airline operating
into Melbourne, BOAC. The little
Comets could land at Essendon. Now
BOAC is pulling out and won’t return
until Tullamarine Day.
You can see the point of all this.
According to one figure, 28 per cent of
all visitors from North America make
Melbourne their destination, a figure only
slightly behind Sydney. The terrible fear
is that if all the visitors step off their
aeroplanes at Sydney they may never
step any further. The business of having
to take another plane is like the old
broken railway gauge.
We called Sir Maurice Nathan, our
leading Tullamarine protagonist. “Shock?
Of course it’s a shock,” said he. “I had
no idea about this. You know what
could happen now? If we open in 1967
we might have Nissen huts as terminal
buildings. And once you get Nissen
huts you get them for 20 years. We've
seen that before. This doesn’t just mean
loss of tourists. Look, the Victorian
Promotion Committee has been negotia-
ting for a big German firm to come to
Melbourne. Now today I learn they’re
not coming. You know why? No jet-
port. They’re going to Sydney because
they will be exporting some of their stuff
by plane.
“Look, any city that doesn’t have a
jetport simply does not rate. You don’t
even get your name on the maps. This
is true. If you look at the tourist air
maps in America or anywhere, Sydney’s
name is on the maps, but not Melbourne.
No jetport.
“Oh, it has been a long tale. Federal
aviation experts first approved Tulla-
marine back in 1958. The land was
bought and 4+ years went by without a
decision. All that time the Victorian
Promotions Committee kept up a fine
propaganda battle. Mr Bolte listed 70
cities smaller than Melbourne that had
a jetport. At one stage we even listed
our dear, little namesake, Melbourne,
Florida, population 100,000. It had a
jetport. Just before the big decision in
1962 Sir Maurice Nathan put out his
last dramatic appeal, a 244-word tele-
gram, sent to everyone in sight, which
cost £l4O. Senator Paltridge then an-
nounced the big go-ahead. I think it was
the words he used that caused all the
damage: “Tullamarine will be the jet-
age showpiece”.
Never will we forget the blasts from
Sydney, the editorials full of outrage.
This was a conspiracy, a Melburnian plot.
Seeing that we had all the leaders on our
side. Sir Robert, Harold Holt, McEwen
and the rest, it was too obvious what was
happening. We got to know the name
Alderman Moran. He said Tullamarine
was a conspiracy to make Melbourne the
great terminal and reduce Mascot to
something second-rate. Even more
dastardly, seeing that NSW contributed
more in taxes actually, Sydney money
would be used to push Melbourne ahead.
“The Age”, which normally does not say
harsh things about anybody, wrote: “It’s
only a matter of time before Aid. Moran,
leader of the anti-conspirators, calls for
the formation of a NSW Air Force with
jet fighters ready to buzz any aircraft
rash enough to head south across the
Murray instead of forcing their way
through the seagulls over Sydney.”
Now the great Tullamarine project
has broken down again. Nobody has
been given a satisfactory explanation as
to why the funds for the terminal build-
ings have not come forward. The Minis-
ter for Civil Aviation, Senator Henty, had
hedged shamefully. Here in Melbourne
we suspect a Renshaw-Jensen-Moran
counter-plot. Strange and frightening
pressures have been brought to bear.
Some time shortly before May 1 Mr
Renshaw will announce that Tulla-
marine is a dead, winged duck and he
will sweep all before him in the NSW
elections.

The Secret Life
of Barry Humphries
Not so much a person, more a way of life
From R. J. SCHOLFIELD In London
It is doubtful whether Australians have
forgotten Barry Humphries. The suc-
cess of his 1962 tour, the sheer quan-
tity of recognition throughout the subur-
bia he satirises and the fact that thou-
sands of his records have been on hand
in the very drawing-rooms to which they
refer have helped to keep the name alive.
When he comes to Australia in Septem-
ber for another tour, the image will
receive a further polish.
Yet in the act of sharpening the im-
pression his countrymen already have of
him, Humphries will be deceiving them,
for beneath the characters for which he
is best known a new Barry Humphries
is being born. He himself does not yet
know what the new Humphries will be
like, but one suspects it may be a poet.
Barry Humphries is already two
people, a sort of schizoid, doing one kind
of thing in Australia and another in
Europe. The two characters he uses in
Australia are Sandy Stone and Mrs Eve-
ridge. The two have gone over well in
Britain (he has even been told how
English they are), but his bread and but-
ter in London is a brief but leading part
in the West End musical “Maggie May”,
based on the story of a Liverpool prosti-
tute. Humphries takes the stage only at
the beginning and end of the show. He
tends to side with the critics who slam-
med the show, but he likes the part well
enough at £1 a minute and he is sure
it will “run for ages”. Between introdu-
cing and ending the show, he kills time
visiting other West End theatres, drop-
ping in at parties or slipping home to
write.
Bread and butter are not enough, how-
ever, for Humphries, and outside “Mag-
gie May” he has found other openings.
Foremost among them is his strip, “Barry
McKenzie”, in the satirical fortnightly,
“Private Eye”. The strip deals with the
adventures in England of an ingenuous
young Australian tourist. In the latest
episodes the hero is disillusioned by the
English, who are constantly fleecing him,
but he is conned out of the last of his
savings, ironically, by another Australian,
a plausible expatriate actor called Sean
O’Doyle, who spins a hard-luck story
about his mother.
Barry McKenzie’s exploits are follow-
ed by 45,000 readers, and McKenzie-
isms like “chunder”, “having a snakes”
and “I wouldn’t say £ no’ to an ice-cold
beer” are creeping into common usage in
highbrow circles. Even the “Times
Literary Supplement” is shortly to pub-
lish an article on the anatomy of Barry
McKenzie, and the London drama critic
Bernard Levin regularly gets “Private
Eye” and throws it away after reading
the strip.
He has just begun another strip for the
magazine “Queen”. It was intended
earlier for the “Observer”, but went to
the sophisticated glossy in a last-minute
switch by his agent. This strip takes the
form of an illustrated advice column for
people in social and cultural dilemmas,
like the homosexual who, having long
taken himself for granted, is distressed to
find, when it comes to the point, that he
has all the symptoms—such as never
having made a scathing remark and
liking stout shoes—of the normal.
Another concerns the child who, after
showing relief when its parents attempt
to punish it by pretending it is adopted,
sets them the problem of how to break
it to the child that it is really theirs.
Another literary task that Humphries,
under pressure from his publishers, is
rushing to complete, is the editing of a
potpourri from “Bizarre”, a French
magazine that combs the erotic and the
grotesque, the blasphemous and the in-
fantile, and which Humphries terms “the
last outpost of surrealism”.
For some months he has had a small
part in the BBC-2 television programme
“Not Only, But Also”, which sets out
under Peter Cook, brain behind the
super-successful revue “Beyond the
Fringe”, to parody BBC-l's “Not So
Much a Programme, More a Way of
Life”, which in turn began as a burlesque
of the arts programme “Monitor”, which
in turn . . . the cannibalism of British
television makes one dizzy. In this show
Humphries has done. little more than
fleetingly appear, but he is good friends
with Peter Cook and may soon find
voice.
He has appeared at London’s “Estab-
lishment”, doing a one-man show (which
was not successful), and on television's
“Monitor” in a satirical Australian
Christmas sketch, which, coming right
after John Betjeman had been lauding
Australia with excruciating earnestness,
seemed somewhat to sabotage the poet's
words. Now “Monitor” wants him to do
a performance as Mrs Everidge showing
her color slides of London, and he him-
self would like, on the same programme,
to pose as an old acquaintance of D. H.
Lawrence, whom he" tries to take to the
local RSL Club during a visit by the
author to Bondi Beach in the early
’twenties. Recently he almost made it
on to the controversial “Not So Much a
Programme . . .” as Dawn Fraser's
“swimming coach” after the news of the
10-year ban, but at the last moment the
swimmer was deemed not topical enough.
Since settling in England in 1959,
Humphries has played principal roles on
the stages of seven West End theatres,
as well as in “Oliver” on Broadway,

many times as Fagin. He is conscious
of much mediocrity in British entertain-
ment today, and thinks he knows the
reason for it: as the country falls apart
there is a frantic compulsion for the
articulate to excel in some way to
counter the decline, and this leads them
into “panic activity” that suffers from
haste, desperation and self-consciousness.
Humphries grows his hair long and is
inclined to let the soles of his shoes
wear through until they flap, but he has
little else in common with the beats who
sport such externals. He is opposed to
pop culture, likes exclusivity and quality,
loathes paperbacks and anything that is
easy to get at and defines himself as a
humanist-fascist —a classification that pre-
vents him from accepting free medical
treatment under National Health but
does not succeed in abolishing his aver-
sion to Sir Robert Menzies, “who”, he
said, “looked so sprightly striding
through the crowds at Sir Winston's
funeral that he must mentally have
changed places with the great man”.
Humphries used to live at Highgate,
but on the day before last Christmas he
moved to a house in Maida Avenue, over-
looking Regent Canal, in London's Little
Venice. There he benevolently rules a
household consisting of fair-haired New
Zealand wife Rosalind, daughters Tessa,
20 months, and Emile, six weeks, and a
French ait pair girl, Dominique.
The drawing-room, with its air of de-
cadent Edwardian luxury, might have
been designed as a fortress against Mrs
Everidge. The walls are crow'ded with
designs by Charles Conder depicting the
lesbian boudoirs of Balzac’s novels, bulgy
creatures lolling and entwined, like
bundles of worms. The theme extends
to two large sour dolls from the Caledo-
nian Market that glare from the top of a
grand piano, where they sit with their
arms stiffly around each other.
Oqueezed between the lesbians are other
paintings by Tom Roberts, Holman
Hunt, Arthur Boyd and Louis Buvelot.
On the lavatory wall hangs a sketch of
Humphries’ old school, Melbourne Gram-
mar. The donor of this work was John
Betjeman, who picked it up in a Padding-
ton junk shop. On each pilgrimage to
the closet Humphries ponders anew on
the unknown Old Boy who, down to his
last sixpence, must have trudged to the
dealer’s with the print under his arm.
Echoes of “Private Eye” and “Bizarre”
fill the bookshelves, where “Musk,
Hashish and Blood” rubs covers with “A
Book of Strange Sins” and “Venus in
Furs”, by Masoch —bound, could it be,
in human skin? There is a “Count
Fanny’s Nuptial” and an autobiography
of Salvador Dali, signed by the man him-
self, whom Humphries knew in New
York and whose wife once cut his hair—
although today, with long hanks alter-
nately peppering his shoulders with dan-
druff and brushing it off, one might not
believe it. “All the best reading is on
the covers,” he muses, smiling upon the
gold lettering of Marmaduke Pickthall,
M. P. Shiel and—his favorite —Jocelyn
Quilp with a delight known only to him-
self and perhaps to Mrs Naylor, his
astrologer, whom he consults on all de-
cisions. He would love to be able to add
to the collection “Professor Murdoch’s
Questions”.
T>arry Humphries does not systematise
his life but plays it by ear the whole
time, and this puts him at the mercy of
his high-pitched emotions. The constant
in his destiny is that he must be enter-
tained by what he does, and this, while
providing nothing so rigid as a plan, has
caused him to form some small immedi-
ate intentions that he has taken so much
to heart that even a recent Broadway
offer of second lead in the musical “Pick-
wick” found him only lukewarm.
While it would have served him well
in terms of money and prestige, “Pick-
wick” would not have supplied the relief
he is currently craving from an overdose
of performing. Humphries, who twice
won the poetry prize at Melbourne
Grammar, is lately feeling an itch to
write, and has suggested he might be
happy doing nothing else. It is a ques-
tion of whether Mrs Everidge will let
him. Even amid the Edwardian discour-
agements of Maida Avenue she materi-
alises, and one must be on guard lest the
dear thing, with a sighing cliche or a
wisp of nostalgia, slip momentarily into
the voice that is continually breaking
into a falsetto, ready to receive her. If
you point to one of the few conventional
pictures in the room, another junkshop
rescue in which Buvelot shows a swag-
man dwarfed by gums making his way
along a bush track at Mt Martha, the
odds are that Mrs E. will croon: “And
there, just over his shoulder, is a little
glimnse of our own Port Phillip Bay.”
One of Humphries’ loves is Portugal.
“It is beautiful and untiring. One can
relax there without being oppressed by
great art, as in Italy, where one must be
scrupulous about galleries and museums
to escape the guilt of squandered oppor-
tunity. It’s the Morninaton Peninsula of
Europe. If only Eric Welsh ran a pub
down there.”
He makes a good living in London,
and although he could probably earn
more in Australia in the short term his
range of performance there would be
more limited, and even if his public did
not tire of it he himself might, which
would amount to the same thing.
He buys a lot of Australian maga-
zines, obeying a need to keep in touch
with the mainsprings of his art-form as
he does with the personal forces that will
continue to pull him back to Australia
for renewal. His eye alights on, trivia that
crystallise as the barbs of his next satire.
Despite his own needs, Humphries
considers that the generation of Austra-
lians that felt Europe could offer it more
has been superseded. There is no longer
a feeling of cultural inferiority, and in
a perverse sort of way Humphries him-
self has probably helped to dispel it. In
his three-month tour from next Septem-
ber, Humphries will perform in Perth,
Brisbane, Hobart, Alice Springs, Auck-
land and Wellington. He will be as avid
as his audiences, especially when he visits
Melbourne, where a car is so often a
vehicle, a book a publication and a house
a home.


Watching New Nations
Emerge
Little birds in their nests
By PATRICIA ROLFE
Watching new nations emerge,
Mrs Elspeth Huxley said, was
rather like watching a bird
build its nest. You just had to sit there
quietly and see what happened. Per-
haps the eggs would hatch out and
everything would be all right. Perhaps
the bird would cast them out of the
nest, or eat them. But nothing you said
or thought about it would have any
effect on the course of events.
Mrs Huxley has quietly watched, and
later written about, the emergence of
new countries in East Africa, notably
Kenya, where she spent much of her
childhood. But after 30 years she felt
she needed a change and chose Aus-
tralia. “Australia is very ‘in’ in England
at present,” she said.
Not that Mrs Huxley thinks of Aus-
tralia as an emerging country. But her
last book, “Back Street New Worlds”,
was “a look at immigrants in Britain”
and dealt mostly with colored im-
migrants who, she says, are Britain’s
“biggest social problem today”. So she
felt she should see how British people
were coping as immigrants in Australia.
Mrs Huxley visited Australia for
three weeks many years ago with her
husband, Mr Gervas Huxley, a member
of the noted scientific and literary
family. She has written something like
20 books, fiction and detective stories as
well as her books on Africa.
While new-nation watching she takes
on the protective coloring of the typical
Englishwoman abroad, quick, neat,
energetic and resourceful. In Western
Australia she was reported as having
been prevented from entering the Kal-
goorlie native reserve. “It sounded in
reports, which, incidentally, were cabled
back to London, as if they had had
armed guards to keep me out,” she
said. “Actually, it was a tiny place with
just a few houses. I waited until the
people came off the reserve and talked
to them in a nearby park.”
Mrs Huxley is in Australia for four
months, which she considers a very
short period to gather material for a
book, although she is aware that many
have been written after shorter visits.
Sydney was a half-way house after
going south and to the west, and with
Queensland and the Northern Territory
ahead of her. She did feel that the
speed with which she was moving about
had given her a vivid impression of the
size of the country which she might not
have got from a leisurely tour. “I flew
over part of the Kimberleys one day
and the river-beds were completely
dry,” she said. “Then 24 hours later
I flew over again and they were in
flood. There was so much water you
could hardly tell where the land ended
and the sea began.”
At her elbow is a man from News
and Information, but she explains him
away by saying that “when your time is
limited you simply have to plan”. As
part of this plan she furnished a list of
basic subjects: Aborigines, migrants,
wild life conservation, art. But, she
insists, she is interested in all aspects of
Australian life. From the amused de-
tachment with which she examined all
the worn cliches about beer, horse-
racing, gambling, and so on as they
were carefully presented to her, one
feels sure that whatever impressions
Mrs Huxley gathers they will be her
own.
They will, however, remain her own
until she has got them safely between
hard covers. “You can ask me anything
you like,” she said, “except impressions
or conclusions. In any case,” she added,
“I think it is ridiculous the way Aus-
tralians , ask visitors their impressions of
the country. Nobody who visits England
or America is asked his impressions.
It’s, well, not childish, but I don’t
know why you don’t grow out of it.
And I don’t intend to reach any con-
clusions. I just record my impressions
and anyone can draw their own con-
clusions.”
One impression Mrs Huxley has
gathered—and which somehow got out
from under her guard—is that the White
Australia policy has become something
of a “bogey” with us. “If you want to
trade more with Asia you will have to
mix more with Asians and that will
eventually mean more of them here,” she
said. “But I can’t see that you are
likely to be flooded by millions of Indo-
nesians, unless you are conquered, which
doesn’t seem likely at the moment. I have
just been up at the Ord. Such schemes
rely on much capital and little labor.
There is no place there for coolie labor.
Schemes like that can only be run by
whoever is running the country.
“I am not in favor of big handouts to
countries, but you can probably profit-
ably exchange people and ideas with
Asia. But the best thing you can send
them is birth-control 'measures. Make
sure there are fewer mouths to feed. I
see that Oxfam is beginning to do this.
It is the only real answer.”
Mrs Huxley feels that it is much too
early to see what sort of nations are
being hatched out in Africa. “It is like
the earth in a molten state,” she said.
“There will probably be several more
divisions and regroupings before things
settle down into any final pattern.”
She made it clear that East Africa was
her field, that she hadn’t been in South
Afriea for many years and does not know
parts of West Africa or the Congo at all.
She believes that the idea of an African
union is a “romantic dream” which will
never be realised. In the same case is
the idea that the people of Africa would
be able to “liberate” the black people of
South Africa.
She felt no one could predict what
would happen in South Africa. The
Verwoerd Government had gone so far
on its course that no retreat was possible.
However, she felt the liberal white cause
was dead. “There is no hope of a multi-
racial society there, or anywhere else if
it comes to that, so the choice is white,
as it is now, or black,” she said. “If it
comes to black it will be long knives for
the liberal whites as well as the present
regime. I believe the liberal whites have
now either left the country or grown dis-
couraged and silent. Whatever white
opposition there is now is mainly a tool
of the Communists.”
As far as Kenya was concerned she
believed there would be a measure of
stability “as long as the old man was
there”. But who or what would come
after Jomo Kenyatta no one could guess.
She did not put much faith in the
Minister of Justice, Mr Tom Mboya, who

'eg’a Trade Mar,
visited Australia last year, as successor
to Kenyatta. She felt he was too moder-
ate and too Westernised for current tastes
in Kenya, and too arrogant to be per-
sonally popular.
Mrs Huxley said that in many ways
the parts of Africa she knew were moving
steadily away from European ideas. One
important way was in the acceptance of
a one-party Government as right and
inevitable for them. There were also
probably * more non-Africans in Kenya
than there were when it was a British
colony. These were often East Europeans,
Israeli or Chinese Chinese influence
was growing enormously.
Mrs Huxley agreed there was no lack
of goodwill between the Kenya people
and the old colonists. “But there never
has been a lack of goodwill,” she said.
“Except, perhaps, for a brief time during
Mau Mau, and that was mostly a civil
war rather than war against the British.
There is no lack of goodwill now. What
is lacking is law and order and this will
force the British people who have been
left with their land to give up eventually.
My mother, who is 80, is still farming
and still has her old people around her.
But any night someone might come on
to the farm and steal some cattle. You
can complain to the local policeman, but
he is a native and not properly trained.
He is quite likely to run in the opposite
direction if there is trouble. And if you
ship cattle away they may die en route
simply because they are not watered.
Nobody understands they must have
water. It is the lack of law and order
which will force the white farmers to
give up eventually.”
Mrs Huxley said that independence in
Kenya came as no surprise to the white
colonists. “What was unexpected was
the speed with which everything hap-
pened,” she said. “We all believed the
change would come over a long period,
that there would be plenty of time to
train people to take over the Civil Ser-
vice and to run the country, and there
wasn’t.
“Since I have been in this country I
have heard people talking about New
Guinea. It takes me back 30 years
when I hear people say we will train
so many people to university level, and
teach so many children to primary level,
that you will do this and that, and that
there will be plenty of time to do it in.
There won't be, you know. And the
more money you pour into New Guinea,
the more education you give them the
more politically-minded and nationalistic
they will become, and the sooner you will
have to get out. You know you are just
throwing your money away, don’t you?”


NEW YORK NEWSLETTER
Private Eyes in Wasteland
The fall of Fast-buck Aubrey
From GEORGE McGANN
The “coolest of the cool” has gone,
sacked as unceremoniously from
his quarter-million dollars a year
job as though he were the lowliest of
TV vice-presidents. But the heat re-
mains on the Columbia Broadcasting
System network which Jim Aubrey
headed and on the other two major
television networks, National Broad-
casting Company and American Broad-
casting Company, for a relaxation of
their death grip on TV programming in
this country.
Obscured by the flurry of headlines
and bizarre rumors concerning the sud-
den removal of the most powerful single
individual in American television from
the position of president of the CBS
network, was a much more significant
development which came to light coin-
cidentally at the same time. This was
the announcement by the Federal Com-
munications Commission in Washington
that it intended to put an end to the
iniquitous system which permits three
men —the heads of the three networks—
to determine what nearly 100 million
viewers will watch on their television
screens during the so-called prime-time
evening hours.
The FCC action, which rocked televi-
sion insiders far more than the firing of
James T. Aubrey junior, was inspired by
growing demands for an improvement
of the entertainment standards now pre-
vailing in what former FCC chairman
Newton Minow called “the vast waste-
land” of commercial television in this
country.
What the FCC proposes to do is to
open up the field now completely domi-
nated by the network bosses, so as to
enable people with different (and hope-
fully fresher and more imaginative)
ideas to put their programmes on the
air. As a major step towards this ad-
mirable goal, the Commission would re-
strict the networks to producing fifty per
cent of the programmes being shown
between the hours of seven to eleven on
weekday evenings. It would permit
other entrepreneurs, presumably inde-
pendent TV producers, the advertising
agencies and the commercial sponsors
themselves, to originate, produce and
present programmes entirely independ-
ent of network control. Cynics might
doubt that this method would actually
result in raising the present level of pro-
gramming concepts, tied to mass appeal
and the mad pursuit of high Nielsen
ratings. In fact the “New' York Times”
envisions “two wastelands” if the Madi-
son Avenue element is given full rein
in the field of programming, along with
the networks.
No man in television did so much to
contribute to the prevailing atmosphere
of TV entertainment, with its base on
the lowest common denominator of audi-
ence appeal, its frantic obsession with
ratings and its callous disregard for
cultural or educational values, than
Jim Aubrey.
Five industries —toiletries, drugs,
tobacco, detergents and food—buy sixty
per cent of television time and pro-
grammes in the United States. Aubrey's
job, as he saw it, was to put programmes
on the CBS network which would in-
duce as many of the potential market
of 100 million viewers to 100k —and buy
—as he could. To attract, hold and
influence these viewers Aubrey's bait
consisted of programmes such as the
Beverly Hillbillies, which he proudly
hailed as his most successful concept,
and Petticoat Junction, a product of the
same assembly line of writers, directors
and producers headed by Aubrey.
Aubrey's ruthless, one-eyed pursuit of
mass audiences earned CBS the domi-
nant position among networks. But what
Aubrey was doing could be done by
others. ABC came up with an inspired
concept—bringing daytime soap opera
to the evening scene, slightly upgraded
in quality—and Peyton Place, with em-
phasis on teenage sex notions, became
an overnight success. NBC countered
with Hullabaloo, a noisy rock ’n’ roll
show which also struck the popular
fancy. The competitive situation among
the three networks shifted dramatically,
so that CBS now finds itself in third
place, “Neilsen-wise”, instead of first.
Aubrey lived by the ratings. Did he
die by the ratings? Conclusion-jumpers
had no trouble with that answer, when
the news of his demise came suddenly
from Messrs Paley and Stanton, his two
superiors in the CBS hierarchy, on a
Sunday afternoon. However such astute
observers of the TV jungle as Jack
Gould, the “New York Times” critic,
refused to take the obvious leap.
Gould derided what he called “careless
speculation that a decline in CBS ratings
was the cause of Mr Aubrey’s exit” and
insisted “the reason was of a personal
nature”. According to “Variety”, that
peerless peeper of Broadway, his bosses
had recently employed private eyes to
report on Aubrey's after-hours’ activity.
An exceedingly youthful and handsome
46, and divorced from a glamor-girl
wife, Aubrey had a reputation as a “real
swinger”. Actually that enhanced rather
than detracted from his image in the
permissive world of television and it
seems hard to believe that any of the
women in his life could have shaken the
TV tycoon from his solitary pedestal.
The private eyes might have been
more concerned with Aubrey’s outside
business dealings, particularly with his
long-time friend Keith Brasselle, an ex-
actor who turned to producing television
programmes which Aubrey eagerly put
on the CBS air waves. These shows
were mediocrities, which helped to bring
down the network's Nielsen ratings.
Despite this, Aubrey unaccountably
maintained his friendship with Brasselle,
much to the wonderment of those who
knew how cold-blooded the TV execu-
tive could be in chopping off the heads
of hapless underlings who made mis-
takes. Brasselle's widespread wheelings
and dealings include night-club opera-
tions. He has an enviable reputation as
a party host whose female guests are the
pick of the Hollywood-Las Vegas-
Miami-Manhattan shuttle.
Brasselle’s appreciation of female
beauty no doubt was shared by Aubrey.
He is famed as the author of a memor-
andum to the producers of the Route 66
programme ordering “more broads,
bosoms and fun” in that series.
But no matter whether it was personal
peccadilloes or Nielsen slippage that
contributed most to Aubrey's dramatic
fall, his departure from the television
heights may be the sign for a long over-
due change in the basic attitudes of
those who control the electronic com-
munications medium. Aubrey symbo-
lised the fast-buck approach and the
preoccupation with people in the mass
which has reduced this young industry
to such chaotic mediocrity. It has been
said that television grew old too young.
The same can probably be said for those
subjected to the incredible pressures,
strains and torments of the upper eche-
lon of TV executives.
When Aubrey's bewildered successor,
handsome and dark-haired John Schnei-
der, was tossed into the pressure-cooker
of the network presidency literally over-
night, he submitted to a mass Press inter-
view.
“How old are you?” someone wanted
to know.
“Thirty-eight,” replied the new boss.
“But I’ll soon be fifty-five.”

ON THE MARGIN
Blessed Are the Budget-conscious
“T>etter amenities will be provided for
senior citizens,” said the local
paper. The report set me thinking how
uncommon the word “old” has become.
People of advancing years move into the
upper age-groups, become senior citi-
zens, present geriatric problems, and
live in eventide homes. But they don’t
grow old any more.
The change is one of many signs of
increased delicacy and tactfulness in the
way language is used. To take another
example, our cities are no longer dis-
figured by slums. They only have
pockets of substandard housing.
These improvements in the use of
words do not come about by chance.
They are due largely to the work of
that fine body, the Society for Less Un-
couth Diction, better known as SLUD.
I called recently on the secretary of the
Sydney branch, Mrs Dulcie Benvole.
She readily agreed to answer questions
about the Society’s work.
“One of the w'ords we don't like is
‘poor’,” she said. “It
causes embarrass-
ment to people who
are not well off. We
at SLUD don’t mere-
ly aim to eliminate
‘poor’ from current
use. We hope to re-
move it from the of-
fensive passages
where it occurs in
literature.”
“Could you give me an instance?*’ 1
asked.
“Yes, take the notorious reference to
the poor in Gray’s ‘Elegy in a Country
Churchyard’. Our Society believes that
it should be changed to read:
The short and simple annals of the
lower income groups.
“Then there is that crude inscription
on the Statue of Liberty in New York:
Send me your tired, your poor,-
Your huddled masses yearning to
breathe free ...
“The American branch of SLUD
(which is very active) is campaigning to
have this altered to:
Send me your lacking in pep, your
budget-conscious,
Your dwellers in high-density areas
desirous of improved living con-
ditions.
“Can you tell me about your Society’s
work on words referring to mental ill-
ness?” I asked.
“We have had outstanding success
there,” Mrs Benvole replied. “I think
the more unfeeling expressions such as
‘mad’ and ‘lunatic’ are now almost obso-
lete. But there is a job ahead in taking
them out of literary classics. ‘Alice in
Wonderland,’ for instance. To bring
the story into line with contemporary
thinking, we would prefer it to introduce
a Disturbed Hatter. Alice could attend
a Psychotic Tea Party.”
“Is your Society trying to suppress
words connected with racial discrimina-
tion?” I said.
“I’m glad you mentioned that,” said
Mrs Benvole. “Our ancestors were quite
callous in that regard, w'ith their habit of
calling dark-skinned people ‘blacks’. The
Society has a special committee to help
abolish this term. Unfortunately it is
common in nursery rhymes and folk
lore.
“We have been trying to teach some
children to say:
She likes coffee, she likes tea,
She likes sitting on a non-white
mans knee. K
But it's uphill work. We are having
difficulties with the
deplorable song Old
Black Joe. Our com-
mittee came up with
two proposed new
titles: Colored Sen-
ior Citizen Joe, and
Elderly African
Joseph. But the pub-
lic response has been
disappointing.”
I asked Mrs Ben-
vole to give me a run-down on the latest
activities of the Society for Less Un-
couth Diction.
“We have persuaded the business
world to drop the term ‘commercial
traveller’,” she said. “It has been re-
placed by ‘manufacturer's representa-
tive’, which sounds much better.
“We are taking ary interest in world
affairs, too. Through our efforts there
are no primitive or backward countries
now; they have all become underdeve-
loped areas.”
“Does SLUD concern itself with
Sex?” I asked.
Mrs Benvole sighed. “I can't v say
we’ve made much progress there,” she
said. “There is very little demand for
delicacy on that subject today. But we
have managed to do something with one
excellent word ‘fulfilment’. It is
coming into use on book jackets. You
will notice that girls find fulfilment with
Italians, sailors, and so on. I saw a
nice blurb for ‘Lady Chatterley’s Lover’:
‘The tale of a well-to-do woman who
found fulfilment with an employee in the
lower-income bracket’.”

OVERSEAS
Dixie’s Beloved
Governor Wallace
“I’d rather he a punk than a pink ”
From ROBERT G. SHERRILL, in Alabama
At a recent meeting of an Alabama
legislative committee where one of
Governor George Wallace’s power-
grabbing bills was under hot debate,
State Sen. Vaughan Hill Robison curled
his lip and asked angrily: “On what
meat does this little Caesar feed?”
The question is easily answered.
George Wallace, who is a hungry fighter,
feeds on the meat of ambition, and
with good effect: he is the strongest
politician to come out of the South
since the death of the Old Kingfish,
Huey Long, twenty-nine years ago.
One should immediately make a dis-
tinction, however: Huey Long was never
a racist and George Wallace, at least
verbally, is little else.
Wallace, unlike Long, reached this
position in almost one bound. He was
only a circuit judge before he became
Governor of Alabama, and he has been
Governor for two years.
Not always popular with other South-
ern governors (Georgia’s Sanders seems
to delight in insulting him), Wallace’s
appeal among the Southern middle class
and farmers is so potent that he is some-
times referred to as the “Governor of
Dixie”. And because of his surprisingly
successful forays into the North as a
buccaneering Presidential candidate,
Wallace, at least last year, could claim
to be the third-ranking power in Ameri-
can campaign politics.
A youthful politician—44 years old
and with the vigor of a former amateur
champion boxer, which he is—Wallace
should be satisfied with his progress to
date. Instead, he is impatient almost to
the point of neurosis. He loathes the
confining details of' the governorship,
the Office consultations, the paper work,
the necessary patronage chats with back-
country supporters. He has national
ambitions. He has been out of Alabama
as much as he has been at home,
spreading the gospel of segregation, and
consumed by what Marquis Childs calls
“an almost-messianic sense of his own
mission to free the South of the hated
Yankee domination”. He is full of re-
marks that have an ante-bellum ring:
“We are part of the United States. Why
don’t they treat us as part of the United
States? We are not a colony.”
Letters to the editors of Alabama
newspapers commonly refer to Wallace
as “our beloved Governor”. Grover
Hall, editor of the Montgomery “Adver-
tiser” and a close friend of the Gov-
ernor’s, does not exaggerate when he
says that “the man on the street is a
religious supporter of Governor Wal-
lace”.
Yet even a man of Wallace’s stagger-
ing popularity must expect to lose some
support when he gets a reputation—as,
in some quarters, Wallace now has the
reputation for debt and taxation,
favoritism, hypocrisy and ruthlessness.
Wallace’s capacity for revenge is well
known. Shortly after President Ken-
nedy’s assassination, Judge Roy May-
hall of Jasper, chairman of the Alabama
Democratic Committee, made an im-
passioned talk to a Young Democrats
meeting at which he laid down the
theme that “we are all to blame for
his death”. Wallace, who had been in
Dallas the week before the assassination
visiting H. L. Hunt and damning the
administration in speeches before Right-
wing groups, was incensed by Mayhall’s
charge.
For days thereafter, visitors to Wal-
lace’s office were brought up sharp with
the question: “Do you think I helped
kill Kennedy?” When a visitor assured
Wallace that he did not so think, Wal-
lace would flare back: “Well, Judge
Mayhall thinks I did.” Brooding on this
fancied accusation, Wallace finally de-
cided to unseat Mayhall, a circuit judge
of high repute for twenty-one years, and
applied the full weight of his office and
machine to achieve his vengeance.
One of Wallace’s most intense grudges
whirls around Oregon’s Sen. Wayne
Morse who, during the 1963 school
integration uproar, called Wallace a
“punk”. The Governor retorted that he
would “rather be a punk than a pink”,
and suggested that Morse “should have
his head examined”. Morse promptly
made public a private file of the Veterans’
Administration which showed that Wal-
lace was on 10 per cent disability for
combat-induced “psychoneurosis”, and
added that “since Governor Wallace has
not been examined since November,
1956, it would seem to be appropriate
for him to volunteer to be examined
(by a psychiatrist) at this time”. Wal-
lace came back with the remark that
Mrs Luce must have been right, that
Morse had been kicked in the head by
a horse.
Wallace’s fame rests entirely on his
role as the standard-bearer of segrega-
tion, and that is the great irony of his
career. For in truth, although Wallace
has carried the message of segregation
(sometimes thinly disguised as anti-
federalism) north to the Canadian bor-
der, east to the Potomac, and west to
the Negro-less steppes of West Texas,
no Southern politician has ever practised
segregation less successfully.
A successful failure
Tt was only after his 1958 election de-
feat that Wallace decided to go all the
way as a segregationist. On election night,
he told friends: “They out-niggered me
that time, but they’ll never do it again.”
And, in a sense, no other politician
has been able to out-nigger him —in

TONS
OF COAL
AN HOUR
That’s a lot of coal... Approximately
4,000,000 tons a year. Every graded
piece is needed to satisfy the hoppers
feeding the Vales Point Power Station,
where ‘English Electric’ 200 MW
turbine-generators create 600,000
kilowatts for N.S.W. consumption.
Problems of transporting unending
coal supplies from three nearby mines
to the Power Station were solved by
Malcolm Moore Industries Ltd.,
installing three enclosed feed-conveyor
belts, each with a 600-ton-per-hour
capacity at 550-feet-per-minute travel.
To complete the next stage get and
keep the conveyor belts operating
Moore Industries commissioned
‘English Electric’. The contract in-
cluded planning, constructing and
actual installation of 14 electric motors
totalling 1610 h.p., interlocking

words. But as his defeated opponent,
Ryan De Graffenreid, remarked when
Wallace moved into the Governor’s
mansion in 1963, still breathing fire and
brimstone: “It’s been the same pattern
in every State where you have a loud-
mouth, rabble-rousing Governor. They
have brought the walls of segregation
tumbling down on their heads.”
De Graffenreid was a prophet. In
his inaugural address last year Wallace
promised “segregation today, segrega-
tion tomorrow, segregation forever”.
But forever lasted only five months, and
today Alabama’s schools are among the
most desegregated in the South. All the
State universities are integrated, as are
all the big city public school systems,
and several rural systems, too. Alabama
is the only State forced to operate under
a specific State-wide court order to de-
segregate.
Oxford, Miss., under Ross Barnett,
was a tragedy; Tuscaloosa, Alabama,
under George Wallace, was only a
farce.
One Alabama college president, ap-
praising Wallace’s “successful failure”
as a segregationist, said: “I would term
the Governor a pseudo-demagogue be-
cause he really doesn’t believe what he
says about the race question. He uses
it only as a technique to get the vote
of the non-rsophisticated white man.”
In winning Alabama’s highest office
Wallace also promised that there would
be no more waste of State money. His
inaugural speech contained the sentence:
“the big-wheeling cocktail party boys
have gotten word that their free whisky
and boat rides are over.” And so they
were. Whisky isn’t served in the Wal-
lace mansion. And one of the State’s
two yachts has been sold.
But Alabama found that there is
more than one way to skin a State’s
kitty. Wallace, who had decried the
seven-plane air fleet that had accumu-
lated under previous governors, paid a
quarter-million dollars for a Lockheed
Lodestar to carry him on out-of-State
speaking engagements. He takes with
him on these trips three highway patrol-
men as bodyguards, a sizeable public
relations staff and several important
appointed officials. They are not in-
expensive ventures, especially since the
Governor is fond of making television
appearances. No full accounting of his
campaign expenses has ever been made.
Wallace claims that they were all
covered by free-will contributions.
At heart, Wallace is a populist. He
grew up poor; the mortgage on his
family’s farm was foreclosed in 1937.
Grateful for what the New Deal was
doing for rickety Alabamans, Wallace
was a devout follower of Franklin
Roosevelt. When he graduated from
law school, times were so hard he got
a job driving a truck. Some of his early
married life was lived in a renovated
chicken coop. When he became a
legislator, he did not forget his back-
ground. He sponsored a number of pro-
gressive bills and pushed them through.
And as recently as the early 19505, he
was stumping the State for progressive
Big Jim Folsom, and damning the rich
folk who opposed Big Jim’s aims.
Then Wallace, like the great but
tragic populist Tom Watson half a
century ago, decided he could not really
get to the top and stay there by dealing
in economic problems—that he would
have to bow to what Watson bitterly
had called “the inevitable nigger ques-
tion”.
Wallace, too, acts as though it were
inevitable. A close friend asked him
recently if he did not think that eventu-
ally, as Negroes become more widely
registered and Southern city folk be-
come more adjusted to the law perhaps
he would have to modify his position
toward the Negro, as Sen. Russell Long
had done.
No, said Wallace, he could not do
that. In fact, he added, the Southern
white would have to think increasingly
in terms of bloc v. bloc, and fight it out
at the polls that way. If national politics
has a place for a man with that rigidity,
then Governor Wallace, with his proven
ability to rally the masses, may have a
fine future ahead. But for his type there
is no middle ground, and if he has
guessed wrong, then he can at best hope
to be placed beside that old broken
musketeer, Ross Barnett, in Dixie’s wax
museum.

Cairo Confronts Bonn
But business is business
By EMERY BARCS
<,(. A re we here to punish Israel or
ourselves?” asked veteran Tuni-
sian diplomat Mongi Slim at the
end of last week’s Arab League confer-
ence in Cairo which met to discuss re-
taliations against West Germany for its
pending diplomatic recognition of the
Jewish State. Sober figures of £s. d.
clearly answered Mr Slim’s anguished
question. In 1964, trade of the 13 mem-
bers of the League was worth £443 mil-
lion with West Germany, a mere-
£29 million with Communist-governed
East Germany. Up to date the Federal
Republic of (West) Germany has pro-
vided almost £lBO million in all kinds of
aid to the Arabs. Except for a small
amount of machinery sent to Egypt, aid
from East Germany to the Arab League
has been negligible. But during his re-
cent visit in Cairo, which started the pre-
sent ballyhoo, Walter Ulbricht promised
President Nasser £4O million of credits
for the purchase of East goods.
To the other 12 Arab nations he pro-
mised nothing.
No true Arab can possibly abstain
from bidding high in the League’s “hate
Israel” campaign. Tunisia’s President,
Habib Bourgouiba, who merely suggested
that the problem of “Palestine” might
have to be solved without war, had
his effigy burned last week in various
Middle East capitals. But hatred of
Israel is one thing and business with
West Germany is something rather
different.
A few Arab regimes may follow Nas-
ser all the way in escalating the retalia-
tory offensive against the Federal Repub-
lic from rupture of diplomatic relations
to economic boycott and—as the piece
de resistance recognition of East Ger-
many. But the majority is likely to stop
before reaching the half-way mark. The
three League members which have most
to lose from an anti-Bonn boycott, Libya,
Tunisia and Morocco, have already re-
served their rights to act as they please.
Libya sells most of its oil to the Federal
Republic—and nowadays it is much
harder to find customers than suppliers
for this commodity. The economies of
Tunisia and Morocco are closely tied to
the Common Market (as is Algeria’s) in
which West Germany has a major say.
The difference between the Arabs’
approach to politics and to business was
quite revealing at the Fifth Arab Petro-
leum Congress in Cairo last week. At
the opening ceremonies delegates enthu-
siastically applauded speeches by the
Egyptian hosts who dealt less with the
problems of oil than with “the cancer
of Zionism”. Eventually, however, there
was much less support for mainly Egyp-
tian plans to “remove this cancer with the
help of Middle East oil”. Nasser him-
self has of course no oil to sell.
But essentially the present Middle
East crisis is a political one, though eco-
nomic factors are bound to play an
important role in its further develop-
ment. For the past 12 years Nasser has
repeatedly tried to exploit the question
of Israel for rallying 100 million Arabs
under his leadership. So far, fears from
a Nasserite preponderance have out-
weighed shared anti-Israeli sentiments in
the Arab world. But just now the Egyp-
tian dictator’s chances seem to be some-
what better than they were ever before.

Bourgeois
Revolt
Madrid’s students
From a Correspondent
Ortega Y. Gasset would have called
it “The Revolt of the Middle
Masses”. For what is happening
in Spain as student unrest continues in
Madrid and in provincial centres presents
a challenge to President Franco’s regime
not by the workers, but by the sons and
daughters of the professional and wealthy
middle classes. After a fortnight of
demonstrations, clashes with police,
strikes and arrests, the students seem to
have had, at least initially, remarkable
success. The Government has agreed to
their demands for a freely elected and
representative students’ union. It has
promised to guarantee the freedom of
the elections and the students will have
direct access to the Ministry of Educa-
tion.
If the Government honors its promise
in practice, not only will the students
have the first western-style democratic
union in Spain but they will have set an
explosive precedent. The workers are
bound to demand similar concessions for
organisation outside the framework of
the State-dominated corporatist unions.
Whatever the long-term effects of the
student unrest the Government is clearly
most concerned about it, more so than
it has been at any time in the past
ten years. It comes as a surprise to
recall that students at the University of
Madrid have been demanding the right
to have their own union for that long.
Yet what makes this year's discontent
significantly different is not only the
much larger number of students taking
part—the overwhelming majority of stu-
dents took part in Madrid—and the
greater range of student opinions repre-
sented, but the way in which the pillars
of the establishment, professors, the
Church and the students’ parents seem to
be backing the revolt.

FORUM
After the “Freedom Ride”
From Aborigine Republics to United Nations
From a Special Correspondent
This article does not deal with the
undoubted fact that the lot of our
Aboriginal people needs improving.
In some cases their plight is shocking,
particularly when their poverty and
squalor is compared with the general well-
being of the community today. But this
article will deal with another, and omi-
nous, aspect of the situation. I mean the
growing Communist infiltration of and
preoccupation with Aboriginal affairs. I
am in no way reflecting on those honest,
self-sacrificing people who have made it
their duty to help the Aborigines.
The Communist Party of Australia sees
work amongst Aborigines as United Front
work; that is, it sees the Aborigines not as
people but as one of a series of steps to
power. This is not something that has
happened suddenly. Since its inception in
1920 the CPA has tried to exploit the
Aborigines.
The “Workers’ Weekly” of September
24, 1931, published its first draft pro-
gramme for Aborigines. It wanted to
establish reserves on ‘large tracts of
watered and fertile country with towns,
seaports, railroads, etc . . .” and “the
handing back . .'. of all Central, North-
ern and North-West Australia”. These
were to be independent republics. They
were to have the right to make treaties
with foreign powers, including Australia,
and be free to establish their own army,
governments and industries.
This programme for Australia’s
Aborigines was largely framed in Mos-
cow. But the chops and changes by the
USSR kept the CPA too busy for the rest
of the ’thirties to do very much towards
implementing this policy.
It became evident around 1945 that
the CPA was still uncompromisingly
against assimilation, because this would
nullify their own mischief-making. They
came out strongly against it. But be-
tween 1947 and 1954 a complete change
was made in the programme to fit the
new world situation.
In 1954 the “Communist Review”
laid it down that the CPA would “fight
against all attempts to split the Aborigi-
nal people (into full-bloods and mixed
bloods) . . . and struggle for unity of
all Aborigines whatever their physical
make-up.” The article went on to speak
of all Aborigines as thousands of power-
ful, militant new allies. What had hap-
pened was that, in line with international
Communist thought, the Aborigines were
no longer an “oppressed colonial people”
(which must be granted “independence”)
but an “oppressed colonial minority”.
A search for leaders of Aboriginal
blood in the early ’fifties resulted in Mr
Ray Peckham, a very engaging Abori-
gine from western NSW, and a Miss
Faith Mussing who, though colored, is
not an Aborigine) going to the Commu-
nist-run World Youth Festival in Berlin.
Mr Peckham revisited Moscow last year
for the World Youth Forum and stayed
some months. Both he and Miss Mussing
have since been most active in Aborigi-
nal affairs, mainly in the Aboriginal
Australian Fellowship and the Federal
Council for Aboriginal Advancement.
It is the latter organisation which the
Communists have been most successful
in infiltrating. Some who are, or have
been, associated with this organisation
are Mr E. A. Bacon, Queensland Secre-
tary of the CPA, Mr J. Fitzgerald,
Queensland Branch Secretary of the
Seamen’s Union and CPA State Com-
mittee member, Mr A. McDonald, Cen-
tral Committee member and Secretary
of the Queensland Trades and Labor
Council, Mr L. Fox, Sydney journalist,
Miss Mona Brand, playwright, Miss
Shirley Andrews, a Victorian science
worker, Mr Sam Aarons, WA State
Secretary of the CPA, Mr T. Zeffert,
WA State Committee member.
The Federal Council for Aboriginal
Advancement is the organisation that
has been plugging energetically to take
the condition of Australian Aborigines
to the United Nations. In June last year
the NSW secretary, Mrs F. Bandler, said:
“To push their claims for improved
status for Aborigines, the Council . . .
considered taking the matter to the
United Nations.” In March, 1964, at
the Council’s Annual Convention of 140
delegates, which included 60 Aborigines,
the General Secretary said: “Council
appealed to United Nations ... A
prompt reply was received . . . The ap-
peal was referred to the Human Rights
Commission.”
So open is CPA infiltration of the
Council that CPA Central Committee
member E. Bacon criticised Communists
working in that body in the “Communist
Review” (March, 1964): “There is a
Rightist tendency even among some
Communists . . . active in the Aboriginal
Advancement organisations to accept
progress made in winning reforms as
proof that the Governments are really
sincere.”
j Aboriginal poet Kath Walker is secre-
tary of the Queensland branch of Abori-
ginal Advancement, but a report from
Brisbane claims that she is no longer
acceptable, being of too independent a
frame of mind, and that there is a move
afoot to replace her with an organiser
from a CPA-led union.
In August, 1961, the Queensland State
Council for Aboriginal Advancement
split and a rival organisation was set up,
OPAL (One People for Australia) to
counter Communist subversion of
Aboriginal organisations.
A recent Press report said that Mr
Charles Perkins, the part-Aboriginal
student leader of the recent “freedom
riders”, is going to suggest launching
nationwide “freedom rides” to the next
meeting of the Federal Association for
the Advancement of Aborigines. If this
is correct, then (without casting any
aspersions on Mr Perkins) it can be
said that there are those in the Associa-
tion who will not have the same high
motives regarding these tours as are
held by Mr Perkins.
For it would be trite to say that at
no time in its history has the CPA
interest in and work amongst the Abori-
gines been more manifest than it is to-
day. Of all the political parties it alone
has a comprehensive programme for
Aborigines and it backs the programme
up with a national network of party
members working exclusively in this
field. Still in its draft form the pro-
gramme has been under discussion by
the CPA and Aborigines for about 18
months and will probably soon emerge,
to Aborigines, as the most attractive
programme yet.

Letters to the Editor
Why Be a Teacher?
SlR.—Victorian secondary education is
described by Governments, unions and
parents as undergoing a great crisis.
According to our experts the sole
problem is lack of money, but will extra
finance alone ease the education prob-
lem? If teachers are reasonably dedicated,
will an extra £2-£3 per week make much
difference?
The point is: what does teaching offer
a young person today? A young teacher
can expect a reasonably secure 9 till 4
existence as a part-time educator, clerk,
sports supervisor and odd-jobs man, but
at all times a public servant. He is not
permitted to criticise the teaching service
or his employer, the Government. Be-
cause his public service hours range from
9 a.m. to 4.56 p.m., and his official
teaching time falls short by 56 minutes
each day, he may be required to work
without complaint through part of his
lunchtime or after school.
His daily grind will take place in either
a new regulation-type grey cement build-
ing or an older red brick, often dark
and dilapidated, structure. In the latter
case, the teacher may find himself work-
ing in surroundings that would horrify
any militant unionist.
If the teacher occupies a permanent
position it is very difficult to dismiss him.
Provided his classes are kept quiet,
appear to have learnt something to satisfy
his immediate superiors, inspectors and
the odd inquisitive parent, the teacher
may expect promotion and the financial
side benefits to eventuate at intervals.
Two associations, certainly not unions
in the militant sense, exist for the con-
venience of teachers. The Victorian
Secondary Teachers’ Association repre-
sents secondary teachers only, while the
Victorian Teachers’ Union claims to
represent primary, secondary and tech-
nical teachers. The aims of both associa-
tions could be condensed into pleas for
greater financial allotment for education,
smaller classes, higher salaries and im-
proved conditions. One current claim
is equal pay for men and women
teachers. At present, women teachers
receive four-fifths of the male salary
rate. To compensate for this inequality
male teachers perform such extra duties
as organising garbage duty in the play-
ground, tending of gardens and duplica-
ting exam papers.
Teachers’ associations are the official
liaison between teachers, the employed,
and the Government, the employer. As
junior and senior teachers, including
headmasters, are likely to belong to the
same association, a grievance of one
teacher against another cannot be dealt
with in the manner one would expect in
a trade union dealing with employee/
employer clashes. A teacher may clash
severely with one of his superiors in a
school without the possibility of union
intervention.
To achieve what might be called
“internal reform”, teaching must be re-
moved from the yoke of the public ser-
vice. Teachers must be able to criticise
inadequacies and faults in the present
system and be given the opportunity to
suggest solutions. The field of personnel
work in maintaining satisfactory work-
ing attitudes could well be introduced
for the benefit of teachers. Room exists
for an independent association composed
of personnel experts and teachers to
individually assist teachers in' need of
advice and to recommend any changes
to the headmasters in schools and to the
Government.

Tibet Part of China?
SIR. —The High Commissioner for
Pakistan, Mr Kaiser (8., March 6), is
reported as having said that, on the
question of Tibet, Pakistan took the
same view as Britain —that it was part
of China. Mr Kaiser can only be re-
ferring to the Simla Convention which
took place on July 3, 1914, at which
it was agreed that China could exercise
nominal suzerainty over Tibet. How-
ever, one clause of the Convention stated
that “so long as the Govt of China
withheld signature to the aforesaid Con-
vention, she should be debarred from
the enjoyment of all privileges accruing
therefrom”. For reasons too devious to
mention here, China never signed the
agreement either then or ever since.
At the General Assembly of the
United Nations in December, 1961, a
resolution was passed strongly condemn-
ing China’s actions in invading Tibet.
The United Kingdom delegate made it
quite clear, both by his stirring speech
and by his voteln favor of the resolution,
that Great Britain regarded the invasion
of Tibet by China as aggressive, in-
human, and unlawful.
Mr Kaiser’s statement would appear
to be mischievous.

Churchill
SIR.—I cannot follow your reasoning in
“Plain English” (8., March 13). Churchill
is not an Australian hero, and most Aus-
tralians know that he declared us expend-
able. He retained the RAAF in England;
he wanted to deploy Australian troops
in Burma. In short he cared nothing
for Australia as long as England’s inter-
ests were being looked after. Let France,
West Germany, etc., honor him, but let
us honor the men who looked after this
country.

The Irish
SIR. —It must not be supposed that the
articles now appearing in the Catholic
newspapers of Australia on Sir Roger
Casement reflect Catholic opinion. We
Catholics have been suffering for far too
long for the sins of the Irish and most
of us have no wish to be identified with
them in any way. Around this time every
year a series of articles appears in the
Catholic Press glorifying a gang of men
who were fools at best and knaves at
worst. All protests from readers are
rigorously suppressed.

Tanner
SIR.—As a Catholic, a father of eight
children in a land of opportunity, whose
family faces extinction mainly because of
the nation’s tiny population, Tanner’s
sneering and perhaps bigoted cartoon
(8., March 20) on the Christian Church
and children is offensive and disturbing.
Tanner reflects deep ignorance of man,
the Church and Australia’s needs. Other
than that he is an excellent artist.

LETTER FROM LONDON
Music’s Babylon
By CHARLES OSBORNE
In pre-war days, England was thought of
on the Continent as das Land ohne
Musik, and although even then it un-
doubtedly had more to offer than many
other parts of the world, it certainly
lagged behind the rest of Europe. The
situation today, of course, is vastly differ-
ent and has been so for many years.
This fact is at last being recognised by
other countries. The Hamburg daily
newspaper, “Die Welt”, declared in an
article some weeks ago: “London has
developed in the last two decades into
the greatest musical centre of the West-
ern world.”
Other important musical cities have
a winter season of 20 weeks or so. with
perhaps a two or three-week Festival
in the summer, but in London the musi-
cal season lasts the entire 52 weeks.
The five major symphony orchestras
which give regular concerts at the Festi-
val Hall are the New Philharmonia, the
London Symphony, the London Philhar-
monic, the Royal Philharmonic and the
BBC Symphony. With the exception of
the last-named, each has its own principal
conductor: Klemperer (New Philharmo-
nia), John Pritchard (LPO), Kempe
(RPO). The death of Pierre Monteux
left the LSO conductorless, but an ap-
pointment is to be made shortly, and the
new man is most likely to be Istvan
Kertesz. The concerts presented by these
orchestras, together with various con-
certs put on by other commercial man-
agements engaging the orchestras, as well
as chamber orchestras and ensembles and
solo recitals, combine to ensure that
there is something on at the Festival
Hall seven nights a week, and Saturday
and Sunday afternoons as well. There
are, of course, smallish halls for recitals
and chamber music in the West End, the
city and several suburbs. Two suburban
districts now have regular symphony
concerts by the London orchestras.
Croydon has its own new and excellently
equipped concert-hall, while at Swiss
Cottage the Royal Philharmonic under
Kempe and several famous guest con-
ductors gives Sunday night concerts in
the Odeon cinema. In addition to this,
in many of London’s beautiful seven-
teenth and eighteenth century churches
there are week-night performances of
baroque masses, Bach cantatas, and
modern music as well. A few nights
ago, in the beautiful St Pancras Church
where J. C. Bach lies buried, I heard a
fine performance of Bruno Maderna’s
“Tre liriche greche”.
None of this would be happening if
there were no audience for it. And much
of the credit for the building-up of a
musically educated audience over the
years must go to the BBC. Its Third
Programme has always introduced new
and unfamiliar music to supplement the
more familiar classics played on its other
two programmes (for even the Light Pro-
gramme offers a certain amount of so-
called serious music). This week’s
radio programmes, in addition to music
by practically every “in” composer one
can think of, include Nielsen’s Fifth
Symphony, Hindemith’s Quartet No. 6,
Cherubini’s “Medea”, Bizet’s “Dr
Miracle”, and works by Wellesz, Boulez,
Henze, Warlock, Bartok, Tippett, Tele-
mann, Corelli, Roussel, Bruckner, Ger-
hard, Luca Marenzio and dozens of
others, as well as a complete broadcast
of Richard Rodney Bennett's new opera
“The Mines of Sulphur”, and a half-
hour’s discussion of the work by its com-
poser, its librettist and myself!
Television, too, plays its part. Many
concerts are televised, artists of the
calibre of Menuhin or Seefried are seen
and heard rehearsing and talking about
the music they play, and operas are per-
formed. Last week we saw a most ex-
citing TV production of the Brecht-Weill
“Rise and Fall of the City of Maha-
gonny”.
As for the opera houses themselves,
their joint achievements are surpassed
only by Vienna with its Staatsoper and
Volksoper which also perform for ten
months of the year. (But even Vienna
cannot equal the rich diversity of non-
operatic music that London provides.)
At Covent Garden, Visconti, Zeffirelli
and the Strauss expert Hartmann are
amongst the producers. In addition to
the Mozart, Verdi, Strauss and Wagner
operas which of course must be made
available to any musically civilised com-
munity, more recent works are included.
Several Britten works are in the current
repertoire, as well as Poulenc’s “Dia-
logues des Carmelites” and Shostako-
vich's “Katerina Ismailova”. In June,
Schonberg’s masterpiece “Moses und
Aron” will be staged.
Such a wealth of activity is naturally
reflected in the achievements of con-
temporary British composers. This is
really what matters most. The fact that
' the normal musical scene in London is
so healthy, and that it is supplemented
by two really excellent Festivals each
year (the City of London in luly, and
St Pancras in March) which I haven’t
space to describe here, has meant com-
missions for composers and frequent
opportunities to have their work per-
formed. Consequently the younger com-
posers such as Bennett, Alexander Goehr,
Peter Maxwell Davies and Australian
Malcolm Williamson are beginning to
take their place alongside the already
established older generation.
THEATRE
Eternal Laughter
Present Laughter. Noel Coward. Russell
Street Theatre, Melbourne.
High Spirits. Hugh Martin and Timothy
Gray, based on Noel Coward’s “Blithe
Spirit”. Princess Theatre, Melbourne.
Thanks to Frank Thring and a great
American female clown called Betty
Kean, the revival of “Present Laughter”
can be counted a success. Both plainly
and uninhibitedly act themselves: Thring
romps in like a huge, lascivious kewpie
doll with a powerful, sibilant baritone.
Miss Keen, at the Princess, creates about
70 per cent of the high spirits.
In a vintage Goon Show, a gentleman
in snowshoes and parka once “mushed”
his huskies through a hot, summery
London, enveloped in his own personal
blizzard. This, more or less, is what
Mr Thring does in “Present Laughter”.
It may not be acting, and the play may
not be art, but the audience loves every
moment.
The plot is so trivial in detail as to
defy precis, but it is superficially con-
cerned with adultery, insincere emotion-
alism and the tug of war between the
young and middle-aged. With its acid
dialogue it is almost a benigner version
of “Virginia Woolf”. It rotates about
the outrageously extroverted actor Gary
Essendine (Frank Thring's own demon
twin), his ex-wife, -business associates
and worshipful young ladies. There is
also an avant-garde dramatist tottering
on the brink of idiocy, a part from
which Simon Chilvers extracts the last
drop of mirth.
In the first act the going is rather
slow as Coward wordily explains charac-
ters and elaborately sets up comic situa-
tions. But the second, in which the
daft playwright and a seductive adul-
teress are embroiled, is still clever, bright
comedy.
Moira Carleton’s production may not
be conventionally stylish, and some of
Coward's eloquence is lost, but Frank
Thring’s presence makes breadth manda-
tory and she has turned a possible liabi-

AUSTRALIA GOES PLACES ON OLYMPIC
Australia advances on wheels ... the wheels of cars, trucks

these hard-working wheels perform best on tyres specially made

lity into an advantage. The sets sparkle.
The whole company enters into the
game with zest. Marie Redshaw is
splendid as the seductress, Bunny
Brooke, Essendine’s secretary, holds her
difficult end up against the impossible
hero, and Stewart Weller, Terri Aldred,
Stanley Page and Miss Carleton herself
richly deserve their applause.
Any musical based on Coward suffers
from a natural handicap: you are bound
to wonder whether the Old. Man couldn’t
have done it better. To say the worst at
once—Hugh Martin’s and Timothy
Gray’s music, lyrics and book do not
fully assuage the doubt. The songs are
suitably mannered in the image of the
original, but they could be more catchy,
and there are no true-born warblers in
the cast. On the other hand, the “Blithe
Spirit” story is so entertaining and so
faithfully dealt with, and the production,
especially of the ballet numbers, so
colorful, that the evening more than
§ ets awa Y it.
But it wouldn’t if it were not for
Betty Kean. As Madame Arcati the
clairvoyant, she is superlatively good.
She ought to be kept in town to play
opposite Mr Thring; the partnership
would be irresistible, if the boards could
stand it. She grimaces, flows, skips and
gyrates her way across the stage like
demented ectoplasm. It’s worth anyone’s
money to see her prance in her bunny-
ears slippers. The other New York im-
portation, Hollingworth, plays
Elvira, the spirit-wife, with no want of
ghostly charm. Ruth, the second woman
in the life of Charles Condomine, the
writer, is jealously involved with the
apparition until she becomes one in turn.
Amanda Fox is Ruth. An English
actress now in Melbourne, she is an
acquisition to the Australian theatre.
She looks, speaks and moves extremely
well. In the present cast she is not
alone in having to cope with the contra-
diction between this type of drawing-
room farce and the essence of a musi-
cal. Stuart Wagstaffs Charles Condo-
mine is up against it even more. It’s
not easy, having to blend the atmosphere
and jaded elegance of a spooky tea-
party with the brio of a song and
dance show. Madame Arcati can take
it on the unsentimental level and there-
fore has no problem, which can also be
said for Edith, the loony maid, played
with happy drollery by Dorothy Brad-
ley.
Edgar Metcalfe’s production scores in
the robustness of interlude scenes, the
inventiveness of astral by-play, brilliant
lighting and the disciplined work of
chorus and dancers. It only needs a
little more body on the domestic side to
be set for a long run.

American producers have struggled
valiantly for years to dramatise the

gratefully the best of them were received

that only “Naked City” was rated a

So, inevitably, we came to “Burke’s

notion that a playboy millionaire police

viewers who tried to take it seriously.

“guest stars” were not. Nor was the

suddenly pathetic witticisms. When a
metropolitan police captain joins in
frequent interchanges at the level of

the jackpot rollers are due to come up
raspberries and lemons.
Only Burke's deductive method
remains interesting. It belongs to the
pure Sherlock Holmes school of “I tell
you, Watson, there is some vital factor
I’ve overlooked.” Very old-fashioned.
Even British television frowns on it,
preferring the near realism and raw
methods of “Z-Cars” or, more recently,
an excursion into the Government
laboratories of “The Hidden Truth ’.
This forensic science fiction series
also has its roots firmly in real soil. The
hidden truth lies in a setting of test
tubes, autoclaves, pungent chemicals,
grey coats, and neo-Beatle hairstyles.
The acting is morbid. Only Alexander
Knox, as the chief boffin, rises coolly
above the environment. The romantic
interest exists weedily in it. But the
scientists, male and female, prove that
realism with a dash of fiction is better
television than the razzle-dazzle glossi-
ness of a “Burke’s Law”.
Faced with such a flux in style of
crime and punishment shows, which
way could Australian producers jump
except on to the fence? Our first police
series, “Homicide” alias “D 24”, reached
the 15th episode before it collided with
Actors’ Equity.
Crawford Productions’ “D 24” was a
highly rated series when radio was an
entertainment medium, and logically it
should have a chance of success as a
television show. In this form it is writ-
ten around the characters of an inspec-
tor, played hypertensively by John
Fegan, a detective-sergeant, played by
Terry McDermott of Collingwood
ruckman stature, and a detective in the
person of Lex Mitchell who may repre-
sent the fresh, young, vital set.
The cases this trio clean up in one
hour are, I am sure, based on Victoria’s
fund of homicides. The settings are
authentic enough, and the camera work
is capable if unadventurous. The same
goes for the acting. But “Homicide” is
not very good television. It is too firmly
on that fence, lacking the flights of
fiction or the earthiness of realism.
There is no truth in the rumor that
“Honficide's” missing episodes were re-
placed by a series of W. C. Fields
classics to show what fictional realism
is like. “Homicide” will continue, and
the Old Master's series are being shown
separately by ATN.

Bloch and Walton, linked here by the
superb artistry of soloist Piatigorsky, are
both composers whose place in posterity's
estimate is rather hard to predict. But
both these 20th-century romantics, I feel,
have more to them than the more im-
patiently progressive assessors grant
them. “Schelomo” is an impressive work
by any standards, gorgeously colored but
intensely serious in spirit (and not so old-
fashioned for 1916.
Walton, always essentially a romantic,
has come in later years to accept more
and more the language of Romanticism
though still with an admixture of the
old Waltonian brimstone. In the 1956
Cello Concerto lyricism predominates
over the brimstone, but the work grows
more appealing with repeated hearings
and Piatigorsky is an eloquent pleader.
There are no two ways about Respighi's
CinemaScopic Roman travelogues—they
are as Dionysian as you please, and
Ormandy and the Philadelphians are just
the ones to present them in their full
colors (“for the first time on one LP”).
Here is everything that the most voracious
tonal voluptuary could ask for.

Satires in Song
Australian Broadside. Gary Shearston. CBS
8P233186.
There will always be a hard core of
genuine folk music enthusiasts, but it
would not surprise me if the current
popular revival collapsed presently due
to over-exposure and the dead weight of
too many mediocre practitioners. With
the exception of recordings made by
Negro artists and seldom released here,
these new albums are representative of
the best that the United States and Aus-
tralia have to offer; yet, doubtless because
my personal saturation point has been
reached already, I found them unexciting.
At least there is nothing dull about the
material used on “Australian Broadside”;
Gary Shearston steers clear of the bush
ballads which comprised his first album
and angrily belts out a batch of contem-
porary songs of social protest and topical
satire, all of which are Australian in
origin and flavor. Amongst the contro-
versial subjects vocally commented on
are the resumption of conscription, the
Voyager disaster, the treatment of the
Aborigines, trade unionism and capital
punishment (the Cooke hanging). “The
Roar of the Crowd” is a particularly fine
number in the Dylan manner written by
Sydney trade unionist Denis Kevans and
convincingly treated by Shearston. “Do
You Know Barry?” and “Sydney Town”
are more light-hearted and admirably
illustrate the use of satire in the folk
song.

BOOKS
Popcult for Eggheads
By R. M. WILDING
The Popular Arts. Stuart Hall and Paddy
Whannel. Hutchinson. 70s.
There have always been critics of popu-
lar entertainment, from the clergy and
aldermen who condemned the Elizabe-
than theatre through Dr Johnson who
dismissed romances read by women. Most
of these disapproving noises were made
in passing, but in the 1930 s the state of
popular culture was viewed with dismay
by the academic critics. Q. D. Leavis
published her “Fiction and the Reading
Public”, and her husband, F. R. Leavis
published, with Denys Thompson, “Cul-
ture and Environment”. These were
books that showed little sympathy with
popular entertainment; their thesis was
very much that the pre-industrial agrarian
society was something of a golden age,
industrialisation and mass production had
debased man, and that the destruction of
the organic society had meant a reduction
in the “quality of living” and was a
threat to culture.
The weakness of all this is clear enough
now historical and social research has
scotched that myth of the happy plough-
boy and the Golden Age; and Mrs
Leavis’s book is of more use in indicating
certain Cambridge elitist prejudices and
taste snobberies than the nature of popu-
lar fiction. After the war came a second
wave of criticism with books by Ray-
mond Williams and Richard Hoggart;
they took over the concern with the popu-
lar culture and mass-media, and a lot of
the arguments, but they viewed the plea-
sures of popular song and women’s maga-
zines more sympathetically. “The Popu-
lar Arts” is firmly in this second wave
Stuart Hall, indeed, is a “Senior Research
Fellow in the new Birmingham University
Centre for Contemporary Cultural
Studies under Professor Richard Hog-
gart.” They’re very organised in examin-
ing spontaneous organic communities
now.
The second wave is more sympathetic
■ — but its sympathy lives unhappily with
the tradition of this criticism, the tradition
of university based, elitist, what’s good
for the people, discrimination. They no
longer believe that all mass media are bad
or that the Press and pop songs are a
constant threat to culture. Yet they can-
not accept the mass media as what the
people want, or as what is good. So Hall
and Whannel have devised a basic distinc-
tion between the mass media and popular
art; the former being generally pernicious,
the latter being both Healthy and Art.
And so we jrun through, saying Yea to
Chaplin, the Music Hall, The Beatles as
popular art and life enhancing, and Nay
to Liberace, Cliff Richard and the other
creatures of the mass media. The im-
portant thing, they emphasise, is to dis-
criminate, and popular art reaching
back to the folk song and the oral epic
poem and the wheelwright’s shop —is
good. “A true training in discrimination
is concerned with pleasure. It places its
emphasis on what can be gained from the
best available. It is careful not to define
the best in narrow terms; by best it will
mean Tony Hancock rather than the
Brains Trust, ‘The Gunfighter’ rather
than the filmed classic, ‘Born, Yesterday’
rather than ‘Lust for Life’.”
What is so frightening in the writing
of these two discriminators is their un-
worried use of unexamined terms. What
is a “true training”? It implies a whole
unchallengeable background code of be-
lief and assumption; they use the term as
an absolute, as if there is TRUTH, and
the rest. Of course, for those who can
happily indicate the BEST as unequivo-
cally and simply as that, there probably
is. They are not narrow minded, though,
as they point out. Yet in the next sen-
tence they can compare critically Han-
cock with the Brains Trust. These seem
two totally different programmes dif-
ferent in purpose, in manner, different in
the type of entertainment we expect from
them. And notice that easy dismissal of
“the filmed classic”. It is fashionable now
to dismiss filmed classics as not “true”
"My God! It's a Coca-Cola badge."
cinema but in a book preaching care-
ful discrimination, a blanket dismissal
like that is unfortunate.
It would perhaps be wro'ng to claim
that Hall and Whannel are totally una-
ware of the problems in making their
discriminations. They do concede “it
is not useful to say that the music of
Cole Porter is inferior to that of
Beethoven. The music of Porter and
Beethoven is not of equal value . . .”
They have avoided one idiocy here, in
not comparing two composers who
would seem to have little in 'common;
but their use of language makes non-
sense of their argument. Certainly
Porter is not “inferior” to Beethoven—
but what else is implied in saying the
two are not “of equal value”? They
concede a difference in nature between
the two composers, but still think in
terms of an absolute “value” that can
be got from both, or that both can be
measured up against. This is not just a
carelessness in writing (though it is that,
and they are careless throughout) but a
carelessness in thought; and the book is
based on similar muddled assumptions.
Discrimination in clumsy hands leads
quickly to crude taste snobbery—and we
have predictably here the conventional
ratings of “Coronation Street” (out),
“Z-Cars” (in —though on the edge); in
film, David Lean out, John Ford in.
More interesting, though, is the way
moral judgments slip into the argument.
True discrimination suggests this—and
it comes out clearly in the comparative
assessments of the Thriller and the
Western, where not merely individual
programmes or books, but the entire
genres are discriminated between. The
Western, as a form, is good, as it de-
pends on established conventions, which
are good, and these permit the working
out of the basic conflicts of good and
evil; mythic is the word that is used.
Whereas the Thriller is stereotyped and
is basically fantasy, and fantasy is bad.
Initially the distinction here is a crude
aesthetic one. “The Western has
achieved a kind of artistic clarity of
shape which the crime play lacks.” How-
ever, this is soon replaced by moral
criticism, and “fantasy” becomes a
knuckle-rapping word. “The sex in
Spillane novels is a form of pure, dis-
tilled, adolescent fantasy.” “These are
powerful fantasies of seduction and
mutilation.” Nowhere, however, is it
explained why fantasy is wrong. And
nowhere is it clear what distinguishes
the fantasy of the Thriller from the
myth and convention of the Western,
and why one stereotype should get a
good word, and the other a bad one.
“Life”, “real”, “authentic”, the perni-
cious terms of some academic critics of
literature, are bandied around. And the
argument, such as there is, is conducted


similarly. Pop songs are often —though
not always—debased, but jazz is a true
popular art, not because it is popular in
the sense of being (as the word would
suggest) popular, but because it has its
roots in the people. “The original
‘swing’ of jazz was the swing of a pick-
axe.” But the fact that jazz has its roots
in the suffering of the people—as we are
told—does not make it any better as
art or as entertainment. Nor, to switch
to a different art, does the statement
that “no moral values are at work within
the film itself” tell us anything about
the artistic quality or the entertainment
power of “Butterfield 8”.
“The Popular Arts” is a very unfortu-
nate book. Its badness suggests that
any criticism of television or popular
film is likely to be bad in this moralistic,
confused and restrictive way; it sug-
gests that criticism is concerned with
comparing and dismissing, rather than
with understanding. It is directed at
schoolteachers, and the harm it could
do to schoolchildren is incalculable.
Worse, it provokes the reaction that the
mass media are better left alone —better
that than directed by the trained dis-
criminations we see at work here; and
that is just what the commercial entre-
preneurs would want us to think. We
agree with Kingsley Amis who is quoted
at the beginning. “I have only reached
the stage of firmly opting for an hour’s
worth of mass-culture in preference to
again being told about it.”
Irishman in Gotham
Brendan Behan’s New York.' Brendan
Behan. Hutchinson. 375. 6d.
A Welsh Eye. Gwyn Thomas. Hutchinson.
375. 6d.
On the Outskirts. Michael Fravn. Collins.
20s.
In the posthumously published “Brendan
Behan’s New York”, the rebellious Irish
playwright disarmingly admits “I know
as much about grammar as my backside
does about snipe shooting” and certainly
this careless, rambling impression of
“the most exciting city in the world”
could not be described as a syntactical
model. It is, indeed, what might be
expected from an ex-Borstal boy with
a natural, Irish felicity with words. If
his writing lacks discipline, it is at least
lively and he displays a tolerant attitude
towards his fellows and a refreshingly
unsophisticated outlook on the world
and its problems. He seldom forgets
that he is a celebrity and, to be sure,
it is a visiting celebrity's view of New
York that he presents, never probing
much beneath the surface of the place
he is describing, be it the Bowery, Coney
Island, Broadway, Harlem dr Green-
wich Village.
“The principal thing to do in this
world,” Behan says at one stage, “is to
get something to eat and something to
drink and somebody to love you.” It
is therefore not surprising that much of
his book is devoted to New York's
restaurants and bars. Other than this,
if his book adds little to our knowledge
and understanding of New York, his
own personality emerges in a way that
is rare in many a more literary work.
Paul Hogarth's evocative if lopsided
pencil drawings are a feature and they
duplicate Behan’s blend of crudity and
sensitivity.
It scarcely seems fair that an obvi-
ously dashed-off book like Behan's
should have so much more vitality than
the carefully composed “A Welsh Eye”.
As he has shown in a dozen novels and
several plays, Gwyn Thomas is a writer
of considerable wit and eloquence; but,
in this idiosyncratic testament to his
country, he is frequently precious and
occasionally dull. Although predomi-
nantly descriptive of Welsh life and
landscape, into this odd tapestry are
woven bits of history, social customs and
conditions, and childhood reminiscenses.
In one of the best sections, typically en-
titled “A Clutch of Perished Bards”, he
pays tribute to three Welsh poets —
W. H. Davies, Dylan Thomas and Huw
Menai.
One gathers from the book that the
population of Wales is about equally
divided between the chapel and the pub
and Mr Thomas wrings quite a few
laughs out of this situation of extremes.
Strangely, much of his rather labored
humor is expressed in Bob Hope hyper-
bole as, when describing a hill-top foot-
ball oval: “It was the only rugby field
where the players were allowed to dip
their bits of lemon in adrenalin while
sitting in an oxygen tent at half-time”,
and, again: “They were badly defeated
but once and then the victors were
found to have two Sherpas on the wing
on loan from Tibet.” John Evans’
smudgy illustrations do little to relieve
the pithead murkiness of what is in-
tended to be a light-hearted book.
Meeting a weekly deadline with a
humorous column must have some very
unfunny moments and occasional lapses
can be excused. Michael Frayn’s latest
collection of his “Observer” pieces has
its lapses (mainly with subjects that are
either too local or too topical to have
much impact here and now), but, on the
whole, as he examines the New Elizabe-
thans and lifts the emotional fog from
the Welfare State, he maintains his usual
high standard. He has the ability to
stand apart from the public scene and
point out not only when its slip is show-
ing but also when its show is slipping.
Unlike some satirists, he has a positive
point of view (slightly left of centre) and
obviously feels deeply behind his screen
of lunacy. He excels when discussing
unhackneyed themes like the importance
of resentment and the role of opinions in
our lives. One of the funniest pieces is
a send-up of unscripted television shows.
Satirists of Michael Frayn's calibre help
to keep a balance in this crazy world.

A Dictionary of the Cinema. Peter Graham.
Tantivy Press. 12s. 9d.
International Film Annual, 1965. Edited by
Peter Cowie. Tantivy Press. 12s. 9d.
Mr Graham’s undertaking was forbid-
ding: nothing less than an account, in
dictionary form, of the works of the
major directors and stars of the cinema’s
history. The job has been done with
heroic zeal, and, despite a sprinking of
mistakes (Edmund Goulding didn't
direct “Broadway Melody”, Emeric
Pressburger didn't co-direct “The Thief
of Bagdad”, and so on) the research has
been thoroughly done. One’s only
quibble would be the book’s relentless
emphasis on “in” names; it is nothing
short of ludicrous to include Walter
Lassally and exclude Harry Stradling,
whose career as a cameraman is far
lengthier and more distinguished.
The International Film Annual, no
less valuable, contains up -to - date
material on work being done in several
countries (including Australia, whose
DOI documentaries are warmly praised)
and, in a convenient form, makes it
clear just what is the state of the cinema
today, following on the slumps and ten-
sions of the earlier ’sixties.

Spring; down at the railway yard
the old bauhinia’s out in flower,
heavy with grit and incessant bloom.
After dusk, in its easy shade
no one cares about drunk or lover
seeking release from growth and grime
and all things thought and heard and
said.
Stumbling alone, or moving together
without shadow, with no name,
they reach the fence and climb over,
shaking the branches as they come.

jAgain the lights slip into the valley
suddenly dark and grown heavy.
From my window when I was young
I watched the land turn dark quickly
and waited for these lights to throng.
The city I knew turned almost golden,
a habit of light in a ready pattern
that made the evening crowd around.
Each night the lights spill out and open
and darkness shoves up without sound
watching them spatter on the ground.

When talking of industry, there can be no question about it the Railways of Australia are outstandingly
the biggest. Collectively, they represent a capital investment of £B7l million. As the nation’s biggest
employer, they directly give employment to 129,000 men and women; indirectly, they give employment to
scores of thousands more—from those who build their locomotives to those who supply carpets for the floors
of their air-conditioned trains.
How big is biggest? The Railways of Australia operate 2,726 locomotives, 7,526 passenger vehicles
and 90,105 goods wagons over 25,163 route miles; have a turnover of £232 million; pay out nearly £l5O
million in salaries and wages; buy goods and materials to the value of £52 million.
Last year, the trains of, the Railways of Australia ran 96 million miles (a distance to beyond the sun),
carried 471 million passengers and moved 56 million tons of freight in a never-ending collection and
distribution of the nation’s wealth. Railway support means more jobs for more Australians to work
towards the ideal of a more progressive, more prosperous Australia.

Antonioni’s Genius
Screenplays of Michelangelo Antonioni.
Souvenir Press. 535.
Antonioni, it turns out, is easier to read
than to see. What has always spoiled the
success of his films is their extremely
slow pace (along a course strewn with
symbolic detail). The screenplays,
however, move much more briskly, as
one would have expected, and reading
them provides an opportunity to review
the famous trilogy with the minimum
of effort. Not that I mean to suggest
the screenplays substitute for the films.
It goes without saying they represent
only a plan of Antonioni’s concept.
(Quite a different matter from reading,
say, the script of “Marienbad”.)
We haven't so far had a chance to see
all three films in one sitting, but a read-
ing of this book suggests they would
gain enormously from such a presenta-
tion. For my own part I am now con-
vinced the trilogy is a masterpiece.
Antonioni mourns the withering of
the human capacity for deep and abiding
love, and over-refined, desiccated or
abstract as his films may appear on the
surface they give ample proof of a
correspondingly emotional, even roman-
ticT approach to film-making. For in-
stance, the structure of “L’Avventura”,
which first audiences took for a perverse
attempt to baffle them, expresses his
theme with heart-breaking poignancy.
The reader will recall how on a cruise to
some volcanic Sicilian islands Anna tries
to explain to her lover why she feels
dissatisfied with their affair. He is too
egotistic, too distracted by other issues
(notably the accumulation of money) to
see what she means. (This is the pattern
of the other two films as well.) Then
she disappears from the islands. Her
“off-stage” decision to leave him only
gradually comes through to us during
the subsequent search; she herself
doesn’t appear again in the film. The
anguish of her lonely decision is con-
veyed most powerfully to anyone who
thinks back when the film has ended.
A very similar effect is used in the
finale of “L’Eclisse”. Vittoria and Piero
part in apparently good spirits, agreeing
to meet again the following day. The
next sequence opens at their usual
rendezvous but as one image succeeds
another we realise that neither means to
keep the appointment. They have both
decided it is useless to carry on.
The most romantic device of all is the
letter at the end of “La Notte”. Lidia
reads a long, rapturous love letter, while
Giovanni listens baffled and rather
bored. “Who wrote it?” he finally asks.
And her answer is: “You.”
An equally romantic feature of the
trilogy is its musical structure.
“L’Avventura” is the opening allegro,
the most brilliant and complex of the
three movements; “La Notte” is the an-
dante; and “L’Eclisse” the finale. Fur-
ther, in all three considerable emphasis
is given to the endings, making of them
well-marked codas.
For the most part, however, Antoni-
oni’s romanticism is carefully subdued.
Nevertheless it has so far helped to
counteract his leaning towards conspicu-
ous symbols. Preliminary reports un-
fortunately suggest symbolism has been
carried to a further pitch in his new
film, “II Deserto Rosso”.
The screenplays, then, provide a use-
ful adjunct to the study of Antonioni’s
work. It is a pity we are not told what,
precisely, they are. They are certainly
not transcripts of the completed films,
because discrepancies exist in many
places between text and film. In his
preface Antonioni implies they are
something like first drafts—but are they
the actual working scripts? Have they
been tidied up for publication? Who
is actually responsible for them in their
final form?
In other words, how authentically do
they represent Antonioni’s thought? The
translation is, in any case, one remove
from this. Some awkwardness in trans-
lation is only too apparent —there is one
real howler: Piero is said to balance a
telephone receiver “between his should-
ers”.
The texts given do provide insight
into Antonioni's methods of filming—
e.g., how much improvisation is there
on the set (a great deal in “L’Avventura”;
almost none in “La Notte”), but a text
based on the completed film would have
been more useful. The book includes
the script of “II Grido” which immedi-
ately preceded the trilogy, and is
generously illustrated with stills.

Greene Corn
Carving a Statue. A play: Graham Greene.
The Bodley Head. 18s.
He’s off again, the old sage whom we
can call a grey-mind if not a grey-beard,
destroying ruthlessly the bourgeois illu-
sion of the essential gemiitlichkeit of
things. Only this time it seems pretty
tired and faded—a long way from the
briliant, anguished, warm-hearted travel-
writings of the ’3os. The play concerns
a father who devotes his small income
and all his time to carving a statue of
God the Father, neglecting any respon-
sibility for the welfare of his motherless
son; this situation provides the content
of the first act. In the second act the
son brings along a girl with whom he
has a semi-lyrical dream conversation,
but who ends up giving herself to the
father, who is hardly interested. In the
third act the boy has found a deaf-mute
girl with whom he is soon to be married;
but the family doctor attempts a crimi-
nal assault on her, and she rushes out on
to the highway and is killed. This leads

the father to make some attempt at com-
municating with his distraught and des-
perate son, but finally he is claimed
again by his obsession.
It all reads like a dim self-parody—a
parody by another hand might be lively
and amusing, but this is sad and slight.
One wonders what unguessable theatri-
cal excellences led the “New Statesman”
drama critic, Ronald Bryden, to award
the play the encomium quoted at length
by the publishers, in which Greene is
likened to “the best Shaw, Pirandello,
Brecht and ‘Beyond the Fringe’.” Or
perhaps on reflection that is the sort of
list you’d have to compile in order to
praise a writer who one admits is not
seized of the skills of the professional
playwright.
Greene himself contributes a techy
“epitaph for a play” by way of introduc-
tion, in which he complains of critics
who found the play too full of symbols,
and declares: “I can detect na symbols
in this play.” Perhaps he can’t; but he
can’t very reasonably object to people
taking up his extraordinary invention of
a gigantic statue of God fifteen years
in the carving and still hardly begun,
and trying to extract a little help from
it in the interpretation of his play. He
suggests himself that it is “a game played
with . . . extremes of mood”, of farce
and tragedy. But the language seems to
let down such an intention: it has
neither the fierce, merciless crackle of
farce, nor the searching insight of tra-
gedy. The dialogue recalls that of
Greene’s' fiction: but lacks entirely be-
cause of the dramatic form, the invest-
ing of sensitive context which “places”
so finely the dialogue of his best novels.
And as a dramatic organisation this
experiment falls well below the level of
his other plays.

The Children at the Gate. Edward Lewis
Wallant. Gollancz. 265. 6d.
The Skin Dealer. Miles Tripp. Macmillan.
365.
Edward Lewis Wallant was an Ameri-
can Jew who died in 1962 at the age of
36, leaving four novels. That his death
was a considerable loss to American
letters was clearly shown by the recep-
tion given to his final novel, “The
Tenants of Moonbloom”. If not quite
as successful, “The Children at the Gate”
(an earlier novel, but just published) is
further proof that a serious and original
writer has been lost.
“If there is a God, why does He
allow such suffering?” is the basic
question Wallant poses and, in each of
his stories, he creates a central character
who, like a latter-day Jesus, feels com-
pelled to shoulder the miseries of those
around him.

VINSON FOR VALUE PRODUCTS
assistant who daily visits a New York
Catholic hospital soliciting orders from
the patients. The stupidity and primitive
Catholicism of his family have forced
him into a bitter, atheistic way of think-
ing. At the hospital he meets a Jewish
orderly called Sammy. Sammy is an
oddball: a drifter with a fund of fan-
tastic “sick” stories; a mocker of the
trappings of religion who, nevertheless,
has an obsession for love as a cure-all.
Even though he is a combination of
oafish clown, psychopath criminal and
saint, Sammy is believable. His practice
of stealing drugs and selling them to
patients in pain is typically ambiguous.
Although infuriated by Sammy’s goad-
ing, off-beat friendship, Angelo can’t
keep away from him and endeavors to
counter his wild sermonising with cynic-
ism and half-digested scientific logic.
The story is impelled towards its
shocking climax by the attempted rape
of a little girl patient and Angelo's ex-
posure of Sammy’s drug-stealing. The
disorderly orderly's eventual melodrama-
tic “crucifixion” on a railing spike and
its “redeeming” effect on Angelo are the
novel's weakest spots, but reduce only
slightly Wallant's remarkable achieve-
ment.
There are no allegorical puzzles or
complex characters in “The Skin
Dealer”. This is a straightforward, pre-
dictable story of a middle-aged love
affair played out against a well-docu-
mented African background. There is
no special merit in the novel, but it is
written in a logical, readable manner
and Miles Tripp avoids undue sentimen-
tality in what could easily have been a
pretty sloppy yarn.
Paul Phelan, a typical British Empire-
builder, is a dealer in animal skins in
Usumbura. His bachelor routine is upset
by the arrival of twice-married Karen
Fiizwilliams, a successful writer, vain,
selfish, unsatisfied. “For Karen each
new experience, sensation and piece of
erudition were raw materials to be con-
sumed as a whole, python-like, digested
and processed into usable copy.” She
writes in her diary: “From the start I
embarked on a deliberate campaign to
put this stable, certain, self-assured man
off-balance.”
Their parryings inevitably turn to
sweet nothings but, even with their love
admitted, he is unwilling to live in Eng-
land and leave his business, she unwil-
ling to live in Africa and give up writing.
Paul's will eventually proves stronger
and they marry, but the conflict is not
yet over. Enter the villain in the form
of an embittered, drunken Belgian
called Vehaeren with whom Karen be-
comes increasingly involved in spite of

Tape-recorder sociology being all the
rage, it was only a question of time be-
fore someone hit on the idea of going
round the United Kingdom to find out
what the much-studied teenagers were
saying about themselves. The result is
as inconclusive as could have been pre-
dicted.
Charles Hamblett and Jane Deverson
have spared no pains, and it may not be
their fault that this collection of snip-
pets is thoroughly disappointing. We
hardly need “Mods” and “Rockers” to
tell us what’s eating them—surely, it’s
all too obvious. Far less do we require
yet another instalment of Christine
Keeler’s confessions to get with it; and
to be earnestly informed by the inter-
viewer that her soft, young English skin
has a texture not found in females of
any other race neither advances our
comprehension nor, probably, would
Stephen Ward have confirmed it.
If anything can be gleaned from all
this, it is that the willing subjects are
human beings who, beneath the decep-
tive uniformity of their garb, remain
individuals with individual hopes and
ideals. Their revolt, if such it be, is
not very far-reaching. They are bored
to the gills with a life that lacks color
and are trying to provide a bit of their
own, and it is abundantly clear that
they themselves are the essential product
of what they are rebelling against—an
advertising civilisation. This is their
misfortune, but not theirs alone. To-
day’s problem kid is tomorrow’s aider-
man.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Britain Forced Closer to Europe
Post-mortems and soul-searching
in Britain after the sterling crisis
indicate that determined efforts
must be made to form stronger Euro-
pean ties. Despite the moral support of
sterling area countries at the time of
the November troubles it was proved
beyond doubt that only the assis-
tance of the European banking sys-
tem (encouraged by US backing)
avoided a forced devaluation of ster-
ling.
The recent visit to Germany by the
British PM, Mr Harold Wilson, stres-
sed the Labor Government’s recogni-
tion of the need for co-operation in
West Germany’s central European
policies and suggests the prospect of
a side-door entry into the Common
Market after France’s slamming of the
front door.
It has been a sore point for a long
time that US and French army expen-
diture in West Germany has been offset
to a large degree by German trade, but
Britain has been lucky to recover just
' more than 30 p.c. of what it spends in
maintaining troops on the Rhine.
Mr Wilson’s visit to West Germany
was to allay German suspicions .on
. Labor policies. He also won some
: German friends, says a London report,
.by stressing the need to extend controls
on armaments in Europe to Russian
intercontinental missiles pointed at
Germany and Britain. In moving
closer to Germany on defence policies
while France sides with Russia to en-
courage American disengagement, Mr
Wilson is seen as paving the way to
stronger trade ties. There have been
even suggestions that Germany might
place orders worth £stg4s million a
year with Britain to cover half the
annual cost of Britain’s Rhine Army.
For example, the Germans have shown
interest in purchasing vertical take-off
aircraft.
All this comes at a time when the
US and Britain are making drastic
efforts to correct their balance of pay-
ments deficits and some of these mea-
sures (like the curbing of VW sales)
are putting the squeeze on Germany.
Britain’s Labor Government is faced
with a precarious situation where, al-
though desperately needing new trade
outlets, its current bargaining power
with Europe is more along the lines of
political and military agreement.
Faced with the need to stave off
another devaluation crisis this year,
Britain is forced to recognise that she
must have further support from Europe
and that her strength (statistically) lies
more in this direction than with tradi-
tional Commonwealth ties. More
DR LUDWIG ERHARD
bluntly, she is faced with a choice of
remaining a dwindling nation living on
past glories or joining a successful
European bloc where it’s a matter of
give and take on the European pattern.
It is not a happy period for Mr
Wilson, therefore, as his Government
prepares to introduce a Budget in an
already deflationary period and when
some of his own supporters are ardently
calling for some stimulus rather than
the conventional restrictions.
Morale wasn’t helped any last week
when it was reported that a number
of large US companies with interests
in Britain were seeking advice from the
Federal Reserve Board in New York
asking if they should pull their money
out of Britain.
Other nations have turned to Ger-
many as a potential source of finance
and trade, now that traditional markets"
in London and New York have been
cut off. With these other nations woo-
ing Germany, it is obviously to Britain’s
advantage to have an open line to Lud-
wig Erhard’s ear. The British Labor
Party in this matter has been forced
by circumstances to moderate its long-
standing suspicion of Germany.
Mr Wilson, of course, did .bring
some tactical advantages to his talks
with members of the West German
Government. He could assume without
any question that the Germans still
want allied troops actually in their
country. If Britain’s straitened economy
might argue for a measure of physical
reduction in the Rhine Army, this is
all the more reason for the German
Finance Minister to search for pro-
jects to allow the elimination of the
yearly deficit arising from the stationing
of British troops.
A certain vagueness still attaches to
the Labor Government’s attempts to
forge a European policy without com-
promising too much its Common-
wealth-directed election promises. Yet
some erosion of these ideals may have
to be faced, not least by Australia.
UK Looks at Dividends
11/'ith Uncle Sam setting the fashion
” on restricting the outflow of
capital, there is strong argument in
Britain that similar action should be
taken to curb the outflow of private
capital.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer
does not want to cut off UK invest-
ment in overseas manufacturing or
exporting if it ultimately makes a
contribution to the balance of pay-
ments (such as financing an overseas
subsidiary in its exports to other
countries, which contributes to the
sterling area balance). So one of the
more obvious suggestions is that UK
portfolio investment in foreign
securities should be pruned.
The conclusion is that dividends
may be taxed more heavily. This
could involve some adjustment in the
double-tax agreements with various
countries (where local tax is deducted

that the April Budget could involve a
general shake-up in company taxes.
A reduction in double-tax relief
could cause some lack of support for
Australian companies which previously
enjoyed fairly strong favor on the
London market.
Advance Planning
Tt should be no surprise that Presi-
A dent Johnson’s instructions to US
banks to curb the outflow of dollars
is taking effect. Many US-owned com-
panies (some in Australia) quietly
admit that they saw the writing on the
wall and took steps to obtain finance in
advance. With their immediate needs
satisfied, they should have no hardship.
Outside borrowers, however, are
encountering a credit squeeze. Europe
reports that the squeeze on dollar loans
has put a real brake on expansion
programmes.
If the restraint on dollar outflow
shows up dramatically in the balance
of payments, as Washington expects,
Australia’s plea for some concessions
(in the face of a notable adverse bal-
ance of payments with America) could
receive sympathetic hearing.
Meanwhile, as advocated here
recently, Australia is giving considera-
tion to double-tax agreements with
various European nations and Japan.

More Protection for Coal?

that the inroads made by furnace oils
into the industrial fuel market have been
greatly to the national economic advant-
age, if only through the lowering effect
on industrial costs.
That it has no intention of doing this
has been made indelibly clear by the
coal industry’s evidence at the Tariff
Board’s current oil inquiry, which claim-
ed that a stiff excise duty should be
placed on furnace oil to offset the
alleged price cutting by the oil com-
panies. Moreover, fearing that natural
gas will also be at a price disadvantage
vis-a-vis fuel oil, prospective marketers
of this product have been equally loud
in their demands for a stiff excise duty
on furnace oils.
The oil industry has not sought to
deny that furnace oil is winning an in-
creasing share of the market for indus-
trial fuels. The order of the coal in-
dustry's loss of markets to oil in the
nine years to 1963 is put at about
21 million tons. In other words, the
coal industry has lost through competi-
tion from oil, say, 12+ p.c. of its market,
in a period when its own production
increased by 25 p.c. Nor has the oil
industry denied that with heavy addi-
tional capital expenditure ' on refinery
equipment it could produce less furnace
oil and more motor spirit to ease back
competition with furnace oil.
In saying there is no case for protect-
ing the coal industry from competition
with oil products, its main argument
before the Tariff Board has been that
protection for the coal industry should
primarily be considered in terms of its
long-term effect on the viability of Aus-
tralian industry in a competitive situa-
tion and the standards of living likely to
be enjoyed.
Its own estimates of the effects of,
say, a-£2 per ton excise duty on furnace
oils, the level which seems to be gener-
ally agreed as necessary to even up com-
petition with coal, are that £5 million a
year would be added immediately to in-
dustrial costs of existing furnace oil
customers. In five years’ time the extra
annual charge would double, quite apart
from any increase in the price of coal
which might be made to take advantage
of the situation.
Significantly, many of the industries
using large quantities of furnace oils in
their present production set-ups are in
the sheltered category but are of key im-
B. W. HARTNELL
portance, such as steel, cement, bricks,
lime and aluminium. Others like tex-
tiles, glass and engineering industries
have to contend with strong overseas
competition, while others are in the fore-
front of exports, for instance meat and
dairy produce. Farther, as was stressed
by a variety of users at the Tariff Board,
furnace oil is used extensively in public
utilities such as railways, electricity,
tramways and gas. An excise duty on
fuel oil would ultimately filter through
to higher charges for all these services
unless exemptions were given.
On top of this, many future major
projects could well stand or fall on the
availability of cheap furnace oil. Cases
in point are iron ore pelletising, magne-
site mining, petrochemicals manufacture
and aluminium refining. Projects in the
mining field, possibly the one area which
holds the best prospects for development
here in the next few years, require oil
fuels for diesel traction, beneficiation
processes, power production, ships’ bun-
kering and dredging. In most cases a
big proportion of the products from
mining will be sold abroad in competi-
tion with producers not necessarily bur-
dened with high fuel oil prices.
It is not that the oil industry neces-
sarily rules out some form of assistance
to the coal industry. It told the Tariff
Board, for instance, that, of the various
proposals put forward by the coal indus-
try, subsidy seems the most appropriate
because it would achieve a slight redis-
tribution of demand for coal and petro-
leum products without affecting the exist-
ing operations of the oil refineries or the
utilisation of crude oil best suited to the
operations of particular refineries.
Indeed a paper by Shell’s economist,
Mr F. G. Weller, went to some lengths
to show that, while the industrial costs
argument was decisive, the coal indus-
try’s claim that balance of payments
■ considerations strongly supported its
case for protection against cheap furnace
oils had weight behind it. This claim
runs on the lines that, being largely
based on imported supplies and conse-
quently making a heavy demand of the
balance of payments, the oil industry
should not be allowed to replace indi-
genous coal in any application in which
coal has been performing and can con-
tinue to perform satisfactorily.
In Mr Weller's view the problem is
far more deep-seated than one of merely
totting up the accounts of exports and
imports and investments involved. It is
one of deciding how best to overcome
the general problem of pressure on the
balance of payments. Reduced to funda-
mentals, it is a question of living with
the effects of direct action to reduce oil
imports, or developing other avenues of
imports saving or export potential to
pay for the imports needed.
Traditionally, he states, Australia has
endeavored to avoid action which would
involve interference with the operation
of normal commercial forces and sees
the reasons for this laissez-faire attitude
as being quite basic to the economic
philosophy of any country based on a
free enterprise system. “It stems from
a belief in the efficacy of competition to
ensure that the best allocation of re-


sources will be achieved and from the
belief that production (albeit with some
allowances for disabilities inherent in the
Australian economy) will be undertaken
as efficiently as possible in circumstances
where competition is permitted to oper-
ate effectively in terms of real costs. If
Australia is to aspire, as it does, to a
diversification of exports, or even to a
minimising of farm costs, then the
achievement of maximum efficiencies in
the use "of fuels must be at the very fore-
front of consideration.”
One of the coal industry’s other main
claims for protection is that it is a sub-
stantial employer of labor. This is less
telling than it used to be, as employment
on the NSW coalfields is now little more
than half what it was ten years ago.
That position is largely the result of
mechanisation and closing marginal
mines. Again it is claimed that the mas-
sive investment of resources in the coal
industry must be protected and for stra-
tegic purposes as a supplier of fuel, say,
to basic industries must be preserved to
ensure coal’s continued availability in
time of war.
Nobody should be deluded into think-
ing either that the coal industry is un-
profitable or that it isn’t already enjoy-
ing a heavy leavening of protection. No
figures are available yet for 1964, but,
in the previous year, returns on share-
holders’ funds of companies in the black
coal industry were on average better
than most industrial groups. Last year,
when output rose 1.7 million tons to a
record 20.7 million tons —most of the
increase going to steel, electricity gener-
ation and exports —results of companies
Will doubtless have been even better,
despite a drop from 30.9 to 30.3 p.c. in
NSW black coal’s share of total energy
provision in Australia.
At any rate the industry's profit
potential looked good enough for Con-
solidated Gold Fields (which doesn't
savor lame ducks) to put another £1 mil-
lion into Bellambi Coal Co. last year to
give it a 50 p.c. interest in the company.
Bellambi earned only 2.8 p.c. on share-
holders’ funds the previous year, well
below that of any of the other big com-
panies in the business (Clutha earned
46.1 p.c. on shareholders’ funds, Peko-
Wallsend 14 p.c. and Muswellbrook In-
dustries 10.2 p.c.).
There is a suggestion that the coal
industry's price-profit control mechan-
ism and range of protection devices —its
favorable tax provisions, accelerated de-
preciation rates, rail and freight con-
cessions, special research grants, Federal
Government handouts of capital for
loading and handling facilities and
general development—combine to dimi-
nish the industry’s incentives to reduce
costs and to use more vigorous pricing
methods. Nobody could accuse the oil
industry of these heinous business
crimes. Maybe coal should take a few
leaves from its book, to the national
advantage, before the Tariff Board hands
it more protection on a plate.
It would be ironical if the Tariff
Board’s current hearings, which are pri-
marily to probe the possible need for
the protection of indigenous crude oil
production, finished up with a recom-
mendation either for an excise duty on
fuel oil or an import duty on crude oil,
as desired by the coal industry to assist
its own competitiveness in the market
for industrial fuels.
(The prospects of a national fuel policy
are further examined in an article on
page 65.)

Too Many Back-Seat Drivers
Industry awaits new wage instructions
TTas the Australian economy too many
back-seat drivers? A good question
at a time when both the Arbitration
Commission and the Tariff Board in their
well-appointed seats in the rear of the
vehicle are deeply pondering what new
instructions they will give the entrepren-
eurs at the wheel and when the monetary
authorities seem bent on misting up the
windscreen in an attempt to slow down
the pace.
It is silly, perhaps, to talk about put-
ting back the clock to laissez faire. But
even discounting
complicating factors
for the economy like
present social wel-
fare priorities and
advances in econo-
mic thinking, there
seem to be far too
many people far too
often shouting at the
driver. This goes for
the multiplexity of
Government voices
as well as the others.
The latter are the
most vociferous.
They have always
been touching the
driver's elbow for
the warning word.
Now they do it vir-
tually sanS'Cesse and
the wonder is our
economic speeds are
so fast. The classical role of governments
was more to see that the economic road
was kept in good repair so that the
entrepreneurs could proceed with the
business of production, distribution and
exchange. Admitting that Governments
had to touch the entrepreneurs for taxa-
tion so they could carry out their road
work,> the classicists thought a minimum
of outside interference with entrepreneurs
the best way to maximise economic wel-
fare. They would turn in their graves if
they could see the measure of interfer-
ence today.
The most frightening aspect of this is
in direct Government interference, pos-
sibly seen at its worst in the influence of
J. R. KERR
fiscal policy on business. For a country
of less than 12 million people this in-
fluence is quite disproportionate. Some-
times one has the feeling that the Federal
Treasury considers itself a sort of dens
ex machina standing above the business
world, oblivious, or at any rate insensi-
tive, to the over-riding fact that business
expectations not only determine the level
of economic activity but also set econo-
mic limits to Government activities. It is
far too prone to look after Government
interests first and to leave the private sec-
tor to tag along after
those interests are
served.
This attitude
springs, I believe,
largely from the in-
evitabilities of a sit-
uation in which the
range and depth of
the Federal Govern-
ment’s activities have
developed to such an
extent that the Trea-
sury has come to re-
gard the public sec-
tor as something set
above the private
sector and therefore
with prior overall
claims on resources.
On the other hand, it
also seems that this
attitude has been
fostered by the re-
moteness of Canberra from the main
centres of the business world. When
the Treasury speaks to the driver in these
circumstances there’s an even chance it is
unaware of the real traffic situation or the
state of his vehicle.
A good example of this is seen at
present when higher interest rates are
being foisted on the economy, by what
seems to be Treasury dictation, in an
attempt to get more money into Govern-
ment loans at a time when higher interest
charges could tip the scales towards a
reduction in business activity.
It would seem that this particular voice
from the Treasury is giving the driver a
different message from that of the brief
expounded by Government’s counsel in

ASK THE 'WALES' FOR DETAILS
9.N.
the current total and basic wage hearings
to the effect that a rise in the basic wage
at this juncture would invite cost infla-
tion. There seems to be no recognition
that increases in interest rates and wages
exert the same uplifting effect on business
costs. At least one might have hoped for
some consistency in the Government’s
messages.
There's no doubt in my mind that the
message given to Mr Kerr is the right
one and that given to Dr Coombs is
wrong. So one would hope that the
former will get through to the Arbitra-
tion Commissioners who will give the
ultimate instruction on wages to the
entrepreneurs.
The Commissioners are certainly faced
with a delicate situation in deciding what
these instructions will be, because the
economy, which in any case looks to be
over the top of this trade cycle, is cur-
rently having to face the prospect of a
reduction in overseas capital inflow and
a worsening in the terms of trade.
Australia has prospered so well in the
last few. years it is only reasonable to
suppose the massive inflow of overseas
capital has had a lot to do with it. We
have been in the enviable position of
having this inflow coming in a period
when the terms of trade have been im-
mensely favorable. While it is difficult to
distinguish which of these two factors has
been helping us most, together they have
freed us of any concern about the balance
of payments and allowed us to get on
with the job of national development with
a will. The result has been an annual
growth rate of about 1\ p.c. at constant
prices over the last three years without
the economy getting feverish at any stage.
A truly remarkable performance.
Unfortunately this happy state of
affairs appears to be coming to an end.
It is not that feverish signs are appearing.
Indeed, rather the contrary. It is true that
consumer prices have veered upwards
from the sideways movement that lasted
for nearly twenty years to the end of
1963. But fever, no. If anybody doubts
this, look at the slump in share prices in
the last two months.
Incidentally it is worth recalling that a
slide of similar dimensions in September,
1960, was followed by the economic
malaise of 1961-62. Granted that malaise
can partly be attributed to the stern
economic -measures introduced by the
Government two months after the share
dive, but there was also a basic disequilib-
rium in the economy, as there seems to
be now, that needed correction. For-
tunately in this cycle the disequilibrium
has not been exacerbated by speculative
fever, so the task of adjustment could
well be easier this time.
We have passed the stage in the cycle
at which speculation could easily have
taken the full employment tide at the
flood. That danger looks to have been
safely passed. It is more likely that econo-
mic activity has moved slightly to the
downside on the cyclical curve, which
has had a more than usually long crest.
The next stage of the cycle could easily
be characterised by growing business
caution. This caution may not have much
effect on the level of investment for the
remainder of this year because fixed
investment pipelines are full and further
flows are waiting to be accommodated.
Thus employment in capital goods indus-
tries should remain high, at least until
the end of the year, whereas there could
well be a contraction before the end of
the year in other areas of employment.
Spending power is still rising but the
rise is tapering off. This slowing would
be expected to continue, giving rise to a
situation in which effective demand would
require boosting. Much would depend on
the trend of savings.
At present saving appears to have
slackened considerably. This suggests
that, for the time being, people have had
to use more of their disposable incomes
to the sacrifice of saving in order to
maintain their living standards in face of
the higher prices.
A small increase in the basic wage
would help to adjust this situation. But
in its judgment this time the Arbitration
Commission has to take particular notice
of the narrower profit margins resulting
for most of industry from last year’s
basic wage increase of £1 a week, which
was too big by half.
We have to thank the prevalence of
strong competition for the absorption of
this £1 rise without prices increasing for
most products. A new rise, say of 10s.
a week, in the basic wage at this juncture
w r ould force many more firms than last
year to attempt to increase prices. If they
did this, many marginal firms could be
in trouble from competitors who were
able to absorb the new wage increase.
One could expect most marginal products
to struggle on. Some would be phased out
and pockets of unemployment could
appear in some industrial areas.
The economic mixture facing Sir
Richard Kirby and his fellow Commis-
sioners is more complex than it was last
year, when the balance of payments
looked set fair indefinitely and there was
no suggestion that the inflow of direct
investment capital from overseas might
be interrupted by United States’ measures
to curtail supplies from there or by the
lessened availability from Britain conse-
quent on its, own balance of payments
struggle.
These facts of life, coupled with future
prospective demands on our overseas re-
serves for rising Government as well as
private imports and some weakness in
export prices, have brought our own
balance of payments back into the Com-
missioner’s court. So while an increase in
the basic wage is probably warranted in
the light of price increases and even on
productivity and effective demand argu-
ments, the prospective position of capa-
city to pay and the danger of more cost
inflation would suggest otherwise, that a
standstill would be the wiser course.


Eating Away from Home
Caterers tackle a variety of functions
/Catering, in all its forms, is a growing
industry in Australia and apparently
a profitable one for those companies in
the field which have the flexibility to
handle a multiplicity of functions.
Natural extensions of trends evident in
this country for many years are part of
the reason for the growth. Also to be
taken into account are businessmen’s
conventions, a growing entertainment In-
dustry which, in turn, requires food for
its patrons, and, to a certain extent, an
increase in home catering.
The trends evident for years are
numerous: weddings, engagement parties,
twenty-first birthdays, companies’ annual
meetings. In addition to these there is
an ever-increasing need for catering at
functions such as horse races and agri-
cultural shows. Undoubtedly, though,
two of the biggest forces behind the
growth in catering have been conven-
tions and nightclub-style entertainment.
As with other industries, caterers face
high wage costs. Their problem is accen-
tuated by the fact that they must pay
their staff for a minimum period, which
means that if, for instance, a drink waiter
is employed at a function he must be paid
a minimum of six hours’ wages, even
though he may only work two. Obvi-
ously the caterer cannot bear this cost
himself, so the end result is a bill often
much larger than the client expected.
Caterers point this fact out to custo-
mers but still often have to face an
angry client when the function is over.
The position becomes even worse after
midnight, when staff has to be paid
double time and provided with transport.
Catering organisations rely heavily on
casuals for a large part of their staff.
They employ a nucleus of permanent
waiters and supplement it with perman-
ent-casuals (those who work regularly
on a part-time basis) or casuals for the
lesser task of clearing up, etc. Here
again there is a wage problem, for the
casual is paid at a higher rate than the
permanent staff.
One of the largest and most flexible
caterers in Australia is Scotts Provisions
(Catering) Pty Ltd, a member of the
Scotts Provisions (Holdings) Ltd group of
companies. The company caters for all
types of functions, both in its own retail
outlets (the Philip Lodge Motel at Ash-
field, Sydney, is one) and outside. At
the opening of Australian Iron and
Steel's new mill at Port Kembla, for
instance, it catered for more than 15,000
people over a few days.
Scotts also holds the lease to cater at
the Royal Agricultural Society's Show-
ground in Sydney. It has recently com-
pleted, with the Society's help, what it
claims to be one of the most modern
kitchen-dining rooms in Australia. Stain-
less steel throughout, it has a 70-foot
counter and the facilities either to cook
meals on the spot or prepare those which
come from Scotts’ factories around Syd-
ney.
Apart from the new installation, Scotts
also has 30 retail outlets at the Show-
ground and six dining rooms and cafe-
terias. The Showground lease is year-
round and the company also caters at
speedway meetings, industrial exhibitions
and other functions held there.
Scotts also caters for private functions
in homes and offices, and runs three in-
dustrial canteens at Arnotts, Commercial
Union and Gilbarco. A director of
Scotts said industrial canteens are “a
costly business, but a necessary one.
The companies subsidise the meals ser-
ved in the canteens. Staff is a big pro-
blem, because there is really only one
selling period a day—the lunch break. A
fair-sized staff is necessary to serve all
the meals in one hour and consequently
wage costs are very high.
“For most of our outside catering we
prepare the food in our kitchens and
take it to the function. We also take all
the crockery and cutlery necessary, and
the staff. Home catering is becoming
more popular every day. I think this
is because of the fact that we are a more
affluent society and people are entertain-
ing more. Conventions and official func-
tions are also becoming more numerous.”
A director of a smaller Sydney organi-
sation, which has its own retail outlets
and caters mainly for private functions,
said his company maintained an outside
catering division “more for public re-
lations than profit. It would not seri-
ously affect our business if we were to
drop outside catering, but we have valued
clients to whom we feel duty bound.
They are regular customers and use our
service regularly.
“Most of our outside work is done at
private homes, where a man may be
entertaining some friends at Christmas,
and for society parties. They are mostly
buffet or cocktail style parties because
the host wants his guests to meet and
mingle. These types of parties have
grown enormously in popularity recently.
We'd cater for four to five hundred a
year.
“A big problem in Australia is lack of
properly trained staff. We, of course,
have our own hard core Of expert staff
who advise customers on food and
wines, but there are not enough of them.
“A noticeable trend in catering is the
swing to more exotic foods. A lot of
people think this is due to the Continen-
tal influence which comes into Austra-
lia with migrants. 1 don’t think this is so.
Australians are travelling overseas a lot
more now and they’re bringing back
ideas with them which they hand on to
their-friends and guests.”
Catering in hotels is also a growing
business. An executive of the Chevron
Hotel in Sydney said that although the
number of meals served in the hotel
(which includes all dining rooms, the
Silver Spade Room, and room service) in
1962-63 and 1963-64 was similar, there
had been a large increase in the latest
financial year. To July 31, 1963, the
hotel served 480,108 meals. A year
later the figure stood at 480,438. How-
ever, for the seven months to February
28 this year Chevron has served 304,570
meals. At this rate it will certainly have
served well over half a million meals by
the end of July, its balance date.

Chevron Sydney does not undertake
very much outside catering. When it
does it is usually for valued clients. “We
have the equipment to cater outside but
we’re not specialising in it,” the execu-
tive said. “To serve the number of meals
we do, we have 145 staff —80 in the
kitchens and 65 waiting on the tables.
We have 35 people employed serving
beverages in our restaurants. In addition
to this we employ about 45 casuals a
week.
“Staff is the main problem with cater-;
ing. Food is not the problem—it’s get-
ting people to cook it. And then there’s
the trouble of serving it. This part of
our business relies on casual staff, the
people who work three or four hours for
us. They are mainly people who work
in offices, those who need more money,
and so on. We have to pay them time-
and-a-quarter compared with the perma-
nent staff.
“There’s a big ‘mortality’ rate in casual
staff because people find that serving
food and wine isn’t as easy as it looks
and requires a lot of experience.
“Conventions are a very important part
of our catering business. Our conven-
tion room seats 1000 people, auditorium-
style. The importance of these con-
ventions to us is not how much food or
liquor we sell. They also bring accom-
modation.”
The executive said catering for func-
tions, conventions and so on within the
hotel was more profitable than providing
meals in the dining rooms and restaur-
ants. “With the set meals for functions
we know just how much it is going to
cost for food a'nd service and there is no
wastage. However, in the normal day-
to-day business there is quite a lot. We
must have meals semi-prepared because
no one wants to wait 35 or 40 minutes
for a chicken, so we partially cook them.
“But if, for some reason, nobody is
interested in chicken and there’s a run
on steak, a lot of poultry is wasted, as
well as time spent in preparation. In
the public areas you have always to cater
for more people than normal, in case
there’s a rush on one night.
In Melbourne, as in Sydney, houses
for receptions are very popular with the
public. Three of Melbourne’s better-
known and more-successful houses are
Rowallan at Ashwood, the Dauphine at
Ivanhoe and £Jine Darling Street, closer
to the city in South Yarra. Mr H. W.
Tickell, the proprietor of the Dauphine,
said that business at the moment was
“quite satisfactory. Of course we’ve all
gone downhill as far as the number of
functions go compared with a few years
ago. Around 350 was a normal number
then, but now we do only 150 to 160
functions a year. The cheaper type of
function has been dropped altogether,
since profit margins are inadequate.
“Don’t forget that today you need sub-
stantial capital to set up in the business
and more to maintain and modernise pre-
mises. Gone are the days when a chap
bought an old house, knocked a few
walls down and gave the place a coat of
paint. With more capitalisation, higher
profits are needed to give an adequate
return. The cheaper functions just don’t
provide this.”
Mr Ken McClure, who manages
McClure’s Restaurant in St Kilda Road,
has seen and foresaw further increases
in trade for the restaurant’s reception
rooms. “Business conventions and the
like are becoming more and more popu-
lar, following American trends. A deve-
loping idea out here is the breakfast
convention from seven or seven-thirty
in the morning and then off to work at
nine o’clock.”
The hotels and motels are a different
story. The former are still losing a lot
of business to the motels —mainly in
businessmen’s lunches and conventions.
According to one Melbourne caterer,
a lot of the small or average-sized func-
tions go to close-to-the-city motels.
“The bigger conventions, of course, are
still at hotels which can provide accom-
modation, lecture areas and so on.
“Two of note are the Southern Cross
and the Chevron. They promote them-
selves and offer inducements to win busi-
ness from other hotels. They have been
fairly successful. Take the Southern
Cross, for instance. It offers cut-rate
accommodation for a man’s wife during
a convention and sometimes even longer
than that when the husband stays on,
over a weekend after a convention ending
on a Friday.'*


Towards a National Fuel Policy
Current Tariff Board inquiry shaping well
rpHERE is every reason for satisfaction
A on the way the Tariff Board’s current
oil enquiry is shaping. The Government’s
ostensible purposes in instigating the
inquiry was to see if a protection solution
could be found to the problem of pricing
and disposing of Moonie oil. Nothing
short of a full objective study of the
matter was required if the differences
between the producers and consumers of
this crude oil were to be reconciled.
To get at the answer the Board has
been traversing the whole field of energy
provision in Australia. One of the fruits
of this will be a series of recommenda-
tions to the Government on possible types
and levels of protection from indigenous
energy suppliers. Another will be that
the Government will get from the enquiry
a full dossier of the relevant facts on
which to base a national fuel policy.
Of course, it would be naive to suggest
that the Tariff Board’s current inquiry
is the first time the various issues have
been ventilated or the facts of energy
cost and provision laid bare. The Tariff
Board itself covered a lot of the ground
in its tivo inquiries into the oil refining
industry before Moonie oil was dis-
covered. Since then there has been
valuable public discussion as well as
continuing work on the subject by the
Fuel Division of the Department of
National Development, the Joint Coal
Board, the oil companies, industrial
mobilisation courses and elsewhere.
On the other hand, this inquiry has
the special significance that it comes
appropriately at a time when something
will have to be done to arrive at an
acceptable pricing arrangement for
Moonie oil before the temporary agree-
ment —under which it is fetching about
30 cents a barrel more than its present
consumers think it’s worth to them
comes to an end.
Equally important, as the evidence
given to the Tariff Board has shown,
there is now an acute awareness that it
is time we had a national fuel policy, and
every interest with a possible stake in
the matter has been talking to the Board
to its own good purpose—in some cases,
the Joint Coal Board for instance, with
an eye to the main commercial chance
and in others, such as the oil refining
interests, mainly in defence of their
present monopoly.
Present peace-time considerations aside,
in the event of war Australia would
have to have a national policy to
rationalise the use of available energy
resources. This would, presumably, be
done by some central authority in Can-
berra, called if you like, a Ministry of
Power. It would be an essential instru-
ment in the mobilisation of economic
resources for defence. It would cut across
vested interests, in particular sources of
fuel supply and disposal, to ensure a
minimum of wastage. This is what hap-
pened in the last war and it worked very
well. It is a short step to argue that a
national fuel policy is required as part of
defence preparations in advance of an
actual war situation.
For security reasons the Government
would be most unlikely to court publicity
for such preparations, even though to
reassure the public and also for political
reasons it could see advantages in doing
so. Whether it is sufficiently active in
this direction or not, it is justified in
putting up a smoke screen. On the other
hand, there is every right to ask just
how far it has progressed towards formu-
lating a national policy to rationalise the
use and disposal of fuel in advance of an
actual war situation.
Pi —-
erhaps because the subject is so com-
plex, public discussion on it has been
somewhat inarticulate. Some knowledge-
able people have been pressing the Gov-
ernment to formulate and follow a
national fuel policy. But seemingly not
wishing to act precipitately and cut
across current commercial arrangements,
the Government has been going very
cautiously, even failing to take what
might be considered an obvious defence
step to conserve what precious little
crude oil reserves we have. It has been
left to the Tariff Board’s present inquiry
to probe possible ways of getting an
energy resources-use pattern more con-
sonant with national requirements in a
peace as well as a war setting.
A broad definition of a national fuel
policy would be one aiming to achieve a
pattern of usage of available fuel re-
sources best conforming to the national
interest. National interest would be
construed as • meeting defence require-
ments and at the same time achieving
the optimum use of fuel and allied re-
sources, given the objective of maintain-
ing full employment and maximising
productivity.
These dual demands of public interest
are not necessarily conflicting. More
obviously, national interests can conflict
with commercial interests and this poses
much of the problem facing any govern-
ment in formulating a national fuel
policy. Without war-time defence powers
constitutional problems pose the main
difficulty of enforcement of a policy.
This is one of the reasons, possibly the
main one, why the Federal Government
is looking for answers to the Tariff
Board.
Although the Tariff Board was chosen
as the sounding board for the various
interests which would be affected by a
national fuel policy, it is to be hoped that
the Government is keeping an open mind
on the possibility that further protection
is possibly not the best method of im-
plementing such a policy.
For instance, it may be the Govern-
ment which would find it convenient
simply to put either an excise duty on
fuel oil or a duty on imported crude oil
to protect indigenous fuel suppliers. On
the other hand, it could well be that all
it needs to do is to introduce import
licensing of crude oil imports. The
latter would ensure that all available
indigenous supplies were absorbed. If
necessary, import licensing could be
supplemented with bounties to local pro-
ducers from consolidated revenue to
ensure their operations were made profit-
able. In short, it has to recognise that
tariff protection would involve local
industry, and hence the public, in higher
costs, while non-tariff solutions would
not necessarily do so.
The main energy sources involved are
petroleum, coal and natural gas. Hydro-
electric power comes into it, too; so to
a small extent does wood and, remotely,
the more exotic energy sources such as
the sun, electric cells and so on. For
practical purposes just now, the main
issues range largely around petroleum
and coal. Though the commercial ex-
ploitation of our natural gas resources
has come a lot nearer in the last year
it has still to arrive.
Of the several angles for a national
fuel policy to take into account, perhaps
the most glaring is the current refining
of Moonie oil in face of the defence need
to conserve indigenous supplies of crude
oil. This is a real teaser. The ideal
would be to keep the oil in the ground,
as was suggested when the problem of
fixing a price for Moonie oil first came
up. My own idea, expressed at the 1964
summer school of the Australian In-
stitute of Political Science, was to ban
its extraction and, as compensation to
the owners of the field, for the Govern-
ment to pay them. on the basis of an
agreed theoretical rate of extraction.
More recently Dr Malcolm Mackay,
MP, has improved on this idea with the

suggestion that the Government should
actually purchase the field. On his
reckoning this could be done at a cost
of £5 million a year for fifteen years.
This may seem a lot for the Government
to pay for a national asset, but, in the
context of a defence budget, say, of
£4OO million a year, not exorbitant,
especially in the light of the need to
sustain private interest in oil search.
At this stage in the not-so-cold war,
the conservation of the small reserves of
indigenous crude oil so far established
here would seem to be the most urgent
requirement for a national fuel policy.
It is sheer folly to be using the precious
reserves of Moonie oil for current con-
sumption.
It could be thought that an under-
taking by the Government to the oil
■.search industry to buy any new com-
mercial field discovered by the industry
until a given national level of crude oil
reserves is proven would be a sufficient
guarantee to ensure rapid exploration by
private interests. Indeed, considering the
uncertainties over the pricing of Moonie
oil and the current world oversupply
position of crude oil, such a guarantee
could well increase investment in oil
search, which in any case needs more
generous tax allowances on new invest-
ment in oil search companies and bigger
subsidies. Nor would it necessarily take
an age to establish the required level
of crude oil reserves.
A s it is, there are several good prospec-
tive oil fields on the horizon apart
from the established commercial field at
Moonie. Alton (Queensland) is con-
sidered a certainty for commercial pro-
duction. Yardarino and Barrow Island
(WA) have good chances, while one or
two other areas in the Northern Territory
and Queensland show promise of success-
ful development.
Despite the improved prospect for
increasing supplies of indigenous oil, we
are still very distant from the goal of
having sufficient oil reserves in sight to
meet our needs in an emergency, even
a short one. We would still have to
import practically all our requirements
of crude oil in actual war. In the light
of this it is also difficult to understand
the Government's recent assumption that
oil search is practically in the position
of standing on its own feet, as intimated
by the Minister for National Develop-
ment when announcing a reduction in
the oil search subsidy programme which
virtually rules out subsidies for wells
outside proven oil and gas areas.
Having decided against keeping the
Moonie oil underground as a strategic
reserve, the very least we should be
doing is to push on with proving more
reserves at the utmost speed, with th«
aid of the maximum assistance the Gov-
ernment can afford.
As it is, the Tariff Board’s terms of
reference in its present inquiry all centre
on the commercial problem of using up
indigenous oil. The Board has been
asked to consider three problems. How
should the value of crude oil of Aus-
tralian origin be determined? What
measures of protection should it be
accorded in relation to imports of crude
oil? What combination of import duties,
excise duties and conditional by-laws
would give the appropriate level of pro-
tection to ensure that Australian crude
is used in Australia, and is marketed
under conditions sufficiently remunerative
to ensure that oil search in Australia
will be continued with vigor?
The Government also wants the Board
to keep in mind the need to keep down
costs of petroleum products to consumers
and also the desirability of making clear
the conditions under which oil search
might expect to operate in the future.
Thus, as the Government sees it, the
main questions about indigenous oil in
relation to a national fuel policy do not
concern its conservation but only its
profitable disposal, albeit paying lip
service to the cost to consumers of any
protection required and to the future of
oil search. As always when tariff pro-
tection is in the offing, the inquiry has
attracted evidence from the whole gambit
of interest likely to be affected.
Making two sides, of a vicious triangle,
the oil searchers and the coal industry
have been weighing into the third, the
oil refining and distributing companies—•
attack being seen as the best mode of
defence by all three. The nascent natural
gas industry has come into it, too, as
being as fearful of future competition
from the oil refinery companies’ furnace
oil as the Joint Coal Board is hostile
about its present competition with coal
in industrial markets.
Nobody has yet made it very clear how
the coal industry’s request for an excise
duty on fuel oil bears on the questions
of pricing and disposal of Moonie oil.
Its alternative, seeking an import duty
on crude oil imports, seems more to the
point, but here its main motive would
seem to be not the accommodation of
Moonie oil so much as to help itself in
competition with furnace oils in the
industrial fuel market, where it claims
the oil industry is guilty of dumping.
The oil companies are against any form
of tariff protection for indigenous oil
and think that the best method of assis-
tance could better be provided by way
of subsidy or bounty from consolidated
revenue. They say there is no question
of Moonie oil not being used in their
refineries, yet obviously they are not too
keen about it at the present going price.

A Quite Ironic Legality
The case of Reid Murray debentures
Seeing that the collapse of the Reid
Murray group was partially due to
the inadequacies of our company law, it
seems rather ironic that debenture holders
are now being denied a cash distribution
from the receivers because of a hold-up
in the legal system. The receivers of Rejd
Murray Acceptance announced last week
that £5l million was available for distri-
bution. However, until the rights of the
Series 3 holders, in relation to the others,
were settled by the Court, no distribution
could be made.
The trustees are still waiting for an ap-
plication on the matter to be heard. They
have been waiting for some time now,
and could give no indication whatsoever
as to when the hearing would take place.
The joint liquidators have estimated
that most debenture holders will receive
15s. in the £, while the Series 3 holders
will get 11s. If the Court rules against
the latter, they will receive as little as
7d., while the others will see their pay-
ment boosted as high as 16s. sd. as a
result.
The unfortunate aspect of the whole
business is that debenture holders are
losing more money every day. They can-
not earn dividends or interest on money
that is rightfully theirs as long as the
receivers are still hanging on to it. Of
course, losses here are .no doubt set off
to a certain extent if the money has been
placed on call and is earning interest, thus
increasing the amount they will eventually
get back.
Few would doubt, though, that a better
return could be earned if debenture
holders had the money in their own
hands, especially as tumbling stock mar-
kets provided some excellent income
earning possibilities recently. And mone-
tary issues aside, the mere fact that they
are being denied the right to do as they
please with their assets is somewhat
appalling.
Surely this is a situation warranting
immediate attention by the Court to the
Series 3 problem.
True Blue
Associated Portland Cement Manu-
facturers (Aust.) Ltd, local com-
pany of the UK Blue Circle group, ex-
ceeded prospectus profit forecasts by
more than 121 p.c. and earned £921,648
in the year to December 31 the first as
a public company.
In the prospectus issued last Septem-
ber directors anticipated a 1964 profit of
£BOO,OOO. A net profit of £950,000 has
been forecast for this year, though on
present indications this, too, will be ex-
ceeded. The profit for the period under
review is equal to 14.7 p.c. on paid capi-
tal of £6,-50,000.
It remains after tax of £389,415 and
depreciation of £697,532. From the pro-
fit the directors have deducted £498,681
to adjust for pre-acquisition profits and
losses and dividends paid to former share-
holders of subsidiaries before they were
acquired. This leaves £422,967 available
for distribution. As stated in the pro-
spectus, no dividend will be paid before
October this year.
Directors expect to pay 7i p.c. for the
nine months to June, 1965, equal to an
annual payment of 10 p.c. On this rate
the ss. shares would yield 3.6 p.c. from
their present price of 14s.

when the result collapsed from the 24.9

in progress and the unintentional over-
statement of past profits. Last year’s

margin in the current year, however.
The interim report said pre-tax profits
had been doubled in the December six
months.
Unfortunately, directors warned in the
same breath that half-yearly compari-
sons could be misleading. The figures
took no account of the profits from
progress deliveries of uncompleted con-
tracts. On the other hand, the unfinished
contracts not taken into account were
not as high in value as those in the pre-
vious period.
Putting all these complicated ifs and
buts aside for the moment, it would be
safe to assume that the group is most
definitely in for a substantial perform-
ance improvement in the current year.
The question that is really nagging
shareholders is that of dividends.
Following the 1961-62 setback, the
121 p.c. distribution was chopped to 5i
p.c. Then came 6 p.c. and 9 p.c. last
year. The current year’s interim is to be
a steady 4 p.c., so hopes for an in-
crease should be put aside for the pre-
sent but not completely forgotten.
Higher than 20 p.c. earnings this year
would warrant a return to 124- p.c.
However, directors will probably wish to
rebuild reserves before doing* this (they
are about £50,000 below the level that
reigned before stock values were ad-
justed). Having regard to this, and in
the light of the big improvement expect-
ed in results, the most likely outcome
seems to be a dividend lift to a nice
round figure such as 10 p.c.
Chemical Profits
TlTith the exception of a subsidiary
which depends greatly on the auto-
motive industry, all companies in the
Australian Chemical Holdings Ltd group
traded profitably for the half - year
to December 31, directors say in an in-
terim report. The subsidiary, Die Casters
Pty Ltd, suffered a severe setback be-
cause of industrial unrest in the motor
vehicle industry.
Reorganisation of this company’s
activities is taking place with the aim of
increasing the products range in other
industries, directors say. Interim dividend
is again 5 p.c., foreshadowing continu-
ance of the annual 10 p.c. rate started in
1963.
Directors also announce that the
Hercules Powder Company of the USA
now holds a 48 p.c. interest in Australian
Chemical Holdings. Originally the com-
pany sought 50 p.c. acceptance of its
offer of 255. a share although it was pre-
pared to agree to a minimum of 36 p.c.
Joint discussions have already been held
between executives of the two companies
on future plans for joint operations.

Two representatives of Hercules have
been appointed to ACH’s board and a
third will be nominated later. They are
(with their Australian alternate directors
in brackets): Mr J. M. Martin, vice-presi-
dent of Hercules (Mr C. R. Catt), and
Dr H. J. Taufen, general manager of
Hercules’ international department (Mr
J. P. Perry).
Australian Chemical’s 10s. shares are
available at the moment for 245. 9d. and
return 4 p.c. on dividend.
Transwest Confusion
A certain amount of confusion must
arise from the interim report of
recently listed Transwest Haulage Hold-
ings. Last December the chairman, Mr
V. J. Roche, said profits in the first
quarter of the year had risen by 24.6 p.c.
But in describing them for the latest six
months, he merely said that earnings were
“higher” and trading profits? “increased”.
This means precisely nothing to the
shareholders and, in fact, could be taken
as an inference-that the increase is some-
thing less than 24.6 p.c.
Fortunately the more important ques-
tion of a maiden dividend rate was not as
clouded. An interim of 5 p.c. will be dis-
tributed, indicating 10 p.c. for the full
year. The prospectus predicted that the
payout in the first year would be at least
9 p.c., so shareholders may end up with
more in their pockets than they expected.
Recovered Raymond
A narrowly covered dividend payer
for the last three years, G. N. Ray-
mond, has decided that discretion is the
better part of valor as far as 1964 is
concerned. For the 12 months to the
end of December, earning rate rose
from 8.7 p.c. to 10.3 p.c., but the distri-
bution is to be held at last year’s re-
duced rate of 8 p.c. The company has
wide interests—supplier to the shoe in-
dustry, printer, box maker, engineer and
timber merchant.
The decision is a wise one, but pos-
sibly disappointing for shareholders.
The 1961 payout was cut from 124 p.c.
to 114 p.c. Then followed a reduction
to 10 p.c. in 1962 and an 8 p.c. in 1963
as earnings continued to tumble.
Although the dividend news may dis-
appoint the pocket, the fact that profits
are at last looking up instead of down
gladdens the heart. ' The three-year-old
nosedive from 25 p.c. earnings to 8.7
p.c. was depressing, if not serious.
Moreover, prospects for the current
year look good although directors have
not said anything about them as yet.

The 1964 result was badly affected by
lower profits in the first half. A fire
damaged new timber kilns at Dande-
nong, causing considerable delays and
disruption to the production and sales of
kiln-dried and dressed timber and timber
components. The recent fires in Gipps-
l'and damaged only 160 acres of young
pines belonging to the group, which
were fully insured anyway.
Not So Sweet
rpo conserve funds for a new factory
-*■ at Ringwood, Melbourne, Mac-
Robertson (Aust.) Ltd, confectionery
group, has reduced its ordinary dividend
for 1964 from 10 to 8 p.c. by elimina-
ting the 2 p.c. bonus paid for the past
seven years.
Directors say that in the year to
December 31 the group's profit rose
from £252,056 to £265,612 after tax of
£167,045 (previously £126,778) and de-
preciation £191,652 (£175,393). The
profit was earned on record turnover.
The smaller increase in net profit is
due to lower margins on some sections
plus the impact of rising costs on the
trade in general. The group's 10s.
shares yield 4.4 p.c. from their current
price of 18s. Id.
Profit Steady
T>rofit of Borg-Warner (Australia) Ltd,
■*- automotive engineer, eased margin-
ally in the full year to December 31, a
preliminary report discloses. This is the
third profit drop in succession. From
£791,216 in 1962 to £523,007 in 1963,
earnings have dropped to £518,395 in
1964.
The latest result remained after pro-
viding £210,000 for tax (£295,000 in
1963) and £339,868 (£268,359) for de-
preciation. Earning rate slips back frac-
tionally— from 24.5 p.c. to 24.3 p.c.
and dividend is held steady at 6 p.c.
with a final payment of 3 p.c.
The company's 10s. shares, presently
selling for 235. 9d. yield 2.5 p.c. from
dividend and 10.3 p.c. from earnings.
Frugal Frigrite
Tn the words of the directors, 1964-65
will most definitely be a year of
progress for Frigrite, the refrigeration
and air-conditioning engineer. But in
the words of most observers, it will not
bring the group much closer to a divi-
dend-paying position. Last week’s
interim report announced a £13,000
profit for the December six months. It
compared with a £5OOO loss in the
previous corresponding period and an
£86,000 loss for the full 1963-64.
The profit, calculated on an annual
basis, would only equal a paltry 4.4 p.c.
on capital. Moreover, the second half
of the year is always a quieter one for
this type of business, so a real effort
will be required to maintain such an
earning rate. Again, the result did not
come from any increase in business but
from improvements in margins and
economies. To throw even more cold
water, it must not be forgotten that past
losses exempted the group from tax.
This must be payable eventually, and
performance is never enhanced by such
a payout.
So the shareholders' chances of a divi-
dend seem a long way off at the moment.
The last payment was an interim of
5 p.c. in 1962-63. The final was omit-

in the red. Unless the group is able to
expand its market and boost profit mar-
gins at the same time, a capital write-
down could well be necessary if an earn-
ing rate of dividend paying proportions
is to be achieved.
AW A Sparks Ahead
T|espite severe competition in the
December half - year Amalgamated
Wireless (Australasia) Ltd was able to
hold profit comparable with the corres-
ponding period in 1963. In their interim
report directors say they expect the full
year’s result to “at least equal” 1963-64’s
record earnings.
They say the improvement mentioned
in the last annual report has continued
into the current year. In the report
directors warned that although there was
an improvement it did not necessarily
mean profit for 1964-65 would be higher,
for the consumer market can be subject
to sudden changes.
Directors expect to maintain the 16
p.c. dividend paid for the last two years
and have made an interim payout of 5
p.c. Final payment has been 11 p.c. which
includes a bonus 6 p.c.
On the strength of the interim report
the market added 7d. to AWA’s ss.
shares to bring them up to 255. 7d. At
this point they return the investor 3.1 p.c.
on dividend and 5.5 p.c. on earnings.
Joy for Jacques
!T*he lift in Jacques Brothers’ interim
dividend from 4 p.c. to 5 p.c. con-
firms the prediction of a return to 10
p.c. dividends in the current year made
by The Bulletin last October 31 (p. 71).
The company operates from Melbourne
as a manufacturer of stone crushing
equipment and excavating machinery.
Directors said in last week's interim
report that profits had shown “consider-
able improvement” in the December six
months and they expected the trend to
continue during the last half of the year.
Shareholders have not seen 10 p.c.
dividends since 1960-61. In 1961-62,
troubles in the quarrying industry re-
duced earning rate from 15.7 p.c. to
6.4 p.c. and the dividend to an un-
covered 74 p.c. The same troubles in
1962-63, plus a gigantic stock write-off,
created a £114,000 loss and no dividend
was paid at all. In 1963-64, the im-
proved trading conditions in the in-
dustry and the absence of write-offs
restored earning rate to 16.4 p.c. and
the dividend to 8 p.c.
Apart from the introduction of more
efficient production methods, which con-
tinues to restore margins, the company
has been helped to a great extent in the
current year by a continuance of the
improvement seen last year in trading
conditions within the quarrying and
heavy engineering fields.
Redhead's Issue
lowing a revaluation of assets,
-*■ New Redhead Estate and Coal Co.
Ltd is to make a one-for-one bonus
issue. Directors say they have been
considering for some time the valuation
of the company’s assets.
Shareholders will be advised as soon
as legal work is completed and will be
given notice of a meeting to be held to
implement the recommendations. Fol-
lowing the bonus, paid capital will rise to
£246,536. In the brief announcement
no indication is given of dividend pay-
ments on the higher capital. For the
past four years it has been 13y p.c.
The 15s. shares currently yield 4.4
p.c. from their price of 455. 6d.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Sydney’s Oldest New Hotel
The Metropole’s excellent record
/~\ver the last few weeks, the prospects
” of four companies engaged in the
“transport” industry have been exa-
mined. The transport industry has been
popular with investors for some time
and the stocks which were examined
were, in general, fairly highly priced in
terms of earnings and dividend yields.
I now propose over the next few weeks
to examine some of the companies
which are engaged in the “accommoda-
tion” industry. This is the modern name
for the group of companies which
operates hotels and motels, where the
emphasis is on the provision of accom-
ipodation rather than on the provision of
alcoholic beverages.
In many ways this industry has been
under a cloud for a few years. It is
perhaps significant that some of the
major companies seem to be in difficul-
ties. Many reasons are offered for the
problems which have beset some com-
panies, including over-capitalisation
(Chevron Sydney being offered as the
classic example), over-supply of accom-
modation (perhaps contributed to by the
building of “terminal” motels), and final-
ly that usual catch-cry “poor manage-
ment”. It Is, of course, very easy to
blame management after the event, but
it should not be overlooked that a con-
siderable amount of luck can intrude
into business decisions. Just as with
department stores, shifts in the public
interest by locality can leave a hotel
quite isolated. This may affect its
business, though it is doubtful whether
this is as important as in the case of a
store. A decision by a government
instrumentality to enter into competi-
tion when there is already “over-capa-
city” must be regarded as an event which
“management” could not possibly have
foreseen and even if it had it is difficult
to see what it could have done about it.
Nevertheless, in a business which pro-
vides personal service, management must
be all-important. Yet it has an intangible
quality which is difficult to assess.
The Hotel Metropole Ltd describes
itself as “Sydney’s Oldest New Hotel”.
In a brochure, it justifies this appella-
tion by pointing out firstly that the
hotel opened its doors for the first time
in 1890 and secondly that nearly £1 mil-
lion has been spent on reconditioning in
the past five years. There is an old
saying which originated in the USA
that a hotel company is neVer successful
until after the second capital reconstruc-
tion. So far as the Metropole is con-
cerned, the capital was reduced in 1912
by cancelling the “A” shares and then
increased by an issue of ordinary shares,
so this may be regarded as the first “re-
construction”. In August, 1920, the old
company was liquidated and a new com-
pany formed. Although this particular
manoeuvre seems to be rather like a
bonus issue, it was described as a “re-
construction”.
The modernisation programme started
in 1959 and by June, 1960, 193 rooms
had been brought up to first-class re-
quirements. Within the next two years,
a further 60 rooms became available
and the elevator services were completely
modernised. Now the Metropole has
over 350 rooms of first-class standard.
From the published accounts, it is
rather difficult to trace the expenditure of
£1 million, though it is possible to trace
expenditure of the order of £700,000.
This suggests that the other expenditure
has been met out of revenue before
arriving at the net profit figure. But,
in the 1962 directors’ report, it was sta-
ted that finance for the renovations of
the foyer and the redevelopment of the
Phillip Street frontage had been
arranged with the company’s bankers.
As the Phillip Street alterations are only
due to commence in the current financial
year, it may well be that some increase
in borrowed funds can be expected from
now on.
While the redevelopment was un-
doubtedly necessary for the hotel’s com-
petitive position, a reduction in profita-
bility can be noticed over the last five
years. Using the usual ratio of net
profit before tax and depreciation to
total capital (fixed assets plus any work-
ing capital surplus), the following trend
can be noted:
Year to June 30 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964
23.3 18.6 19.3 17.7 16.5
So far as earnings and dividends are
concerned, the company has a very good
record not only in recent years but also
prior to and since World War 11. Over
the last nine years, the adjusted earnings
and dividend rates (adjusted for bonus
issues and the bonus content of rights
issues) appear as follows:
Year to
June 30 '56 '57 '5B '59 '6O '6l '62 '63 '64
Earning •
rate 8.5 10.5 10.1 12.7 14.8 15.4 14.6 15.9 16.3
Dividend
rate 8.3 8.3 8.3 8.3 11.1 12.5 12.5 14.0 14.0
These figures indicate that earnings
have been increasing at the average
annual compound rate of 8J p.c., which
is rather in excess of the increase in the
Gross National Product and therefore
puts the Metropole into the growth-
stock class. Dividends have increased
at the rate of 6f p.c. per annum during
the same period and this would certainly
justify the shares being on a 4 p.c. divi-
dend yield basis.
At the time of writing the shares were
not being sought by any buyer and a
seller was asking 19s. The last sale took
place at 18s. 9d. If the shares were to
yield 4 p.c. the price would be 355.!
It is most unlikely that the shares will
ever see this price in the near future.
However, once the investing public can
convince themselves that the Metropole
has survived the opening of the Menzies
Hotel, the Chevron Sydney Hotel and
many others in its 75-year history, and
consequently it is likely to survive the
opening of the Qantas Hotel, the price
could rise to 235. 6d.
A glance at the Metropole’s latest
tariff indicates the company’s strength.
In very general terms the rates are
50 p.c. less than the rates of the modern
hotels. There will always be a large
number of Australians (and not only
farmers and graziers) who will accept
the Old New Hotel because it is less
expensive.
In any case, you cannot go very far
wrong when buying a share with the
record shown above that today yields
li p.c.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Built Upon Co-ownership
Commodore Motels not for a quick turn
IIfHEN Victorian- based Commodore
Motels Ltd floated to the public
lists in mid-1962 it was the holding com-
pany for a motel at Geelong, one at
Colac and the Racecourse hotel-motel at
Flemington, totalling 83 units in all. In
1962-63 the funds from the public issue
launched the Queen’s Road (Melbourne)
motel of 40 units. The historic Western
Hotel in the heart of Warrnambool was
reconstructed into a 20-unit co-owned
hotel-motel, giving a grand total of 213
units at balance date, June 30, 1963.
Growth in the recent 1963-64 year
was substantial but not as startling. A
28-unit hotel-motel was completed at
Shepparton and a 30-unit hotel-motel at
Jindabyne in the Snowy Mountains area
of NSW. Both projects were developed
under the co-ownership plan, lifting the
total number of units to 271.
Directors, in their recent interim
report, are still able to talk about a
65 p.c. lift in gross income for the
December half-year, though earning rate
on capital remains much at 1963-64
levels. For the group now receives only
half the profits of the Queen’s Road and
Geelong motels (a 50 p.c. interest in
both having been sold); Shepparton and
Jindabyne hotel-motels are not yet
making any major contribution to pro-
fits.
Co-ownership has been extended to
all the group’s establishments now, with
the exception of the one at Flemington.
Colac, Queen's Road and Geelong have
all become only 50 p.c. owned in the
interests of providing internal cash for
expansion. No doubt Flemington will
go, too, when a favorable opportunity
presents itself.
Directors of the company hold the
avoidance of capital issues as a virtue.
Shareholders would, of course, agree as
long as benefits are generous in other
directions, such as a high rate of divi-
dend or the periodical bonus issue once
new ventures prove successful and re-
serves and earning rates have been built
to high levels. Putting these thoughts
aside for the moment, the board's aim to
finance the extension of their motel
chain from retained profits is most de-
finitely a wise one.
The co-ownership technique goes a
long way towards this goal, capital contri-
butions being offset to a large .extent by
building profits (the group has a subsidi-
ary which does a lot of the building).
Anything extra can be financed by re-
tained profits from normal trading.
The principle is not a new one, yet
it is unique and so far successful in the
motel trade. A refinement is the man-
agement of the co-owner’s investment.
In all, the company acquires a half-
interest for a minimum outlay, while a
larger share of net profits is attained by
passing on to others what would other-
wise be head-office management costs.
As the cash required for each venture,
after allowing for building profits, must
be found from the cash flow (retained
profits plus depreciation), development
is primarily geared to this flow. So a
type of natural “brake” is provided on
expansion, which may otherwise be in
danger of becoming too rapid.
A policy of financing 50 p.c. of each
new project by mortgage loan is fol-
lowed. The loans are usually for half
the value of the land and buildings, the
rest being capital from Commodore and
the co-owner in equal parts. This re-
stricts group borrowings to half the
fixed assets values, which is a fairly, con-
servative approach, for such a rapidly
expanding company, to the dangerous
business of borrowing.
At June 30 last there were five motels
and four hotel-motels in the chain. By
the end of the current financial year the
total figure will have grown from nine
to 15 and the units will take a pheno-
menal leap from 271 to 435.
As usual, sites have been selected
right in the middle of each township.
Initial cost is obviously made high, but
should pay off in the long run with in-
creased property valuations and higher
occupancy figures. A small 20-unit
motel will be ready in March for the
main street of Hay (NSW) on the Syd-
ney-Adelaide route. In Launceston
(Tas.), 30 units are ready in Brisbane
Street, overlooking the gardens, while
Albury will have 40 units across the
road from the Post Office. Opposite the
Grand Hotel in Deakin Avenue, Mil-
dura, will be a 40-unit motel.
A deal similar to the Warrnambool
one has been contracted for the Com-
mercial Hotel in Colac (where a 22-unit
motel is already owned on the out-
skirts). Again in the main street and
next to the post office, the hotel will be
modernised and a 20-unit motel wing
constructed alongside. The two are not
expected to clash, as the latter is essen-
tially a hotel business.
Finally, this financial year will see the
completion of the company’s biggest
project ever, and probably the riskiest.


From the Melbourne Racing Club
eleven acres have been purchased adja-
cent to the Sandown Park racecourse on
the Princes Highway, Springvale. Con-
struction has started on the hotel (it
will have, one of Victoria’s highest
licence fees) with a drive-in restaurant,
cocktail lounge (American-style, natur-
ally), 14 motel rooms, a drive-in bottle
department and parking for 700 cars.
The risk lies in the fact that, on its
biggest capital project ever, the com-
pany has seen fit to waive its principle
of building right iff the heart of things.
Surrounding the site are a few houses,
no shops or shopping centres, the
Springvale crematorium and the still
under-utilised racecourse. It is on a
speedy stretch of divided highway, half-
way between Melbourne and Dande-
nong. Although the hordes of passing
traffic and the big-scale nature of the
project should attract enough custom to
avoid any serious monetary problems,
the hotel is very likely to be something
of a lame dog for a few years yet,- at
least until the racecourse is more fre-
quently used and the rapid urban spread
engulfs it wholeheartedly instead of only
just, as at present.
Co-ownership has not been lined up
for the hotel yet, either —another de-
parture from the formula which has
proved so successful to date. Most of
the new motels, as well as the existing
ones, will incorporate restaurants. Some
have the blessing of a liquor licence
Geelong, Queen’s Road and Bendigo
were all granted one last year, thus pro-
viding another valuable source of pro-
fit. '
When the growth rate eventually
tapers off, shareholders can look for-
ward to getting a bigger slice of the
annual profits in one form or another.
The most likely will be the bonus issue,
coming from reserve build-ups once pro-
fits are no longer needed for expansion
or from the asset revaluations which will
be part and parcel of the group in the
years to come, considering the valuable
sites it holds at present. How far away
these days of plenty are is impossible
to ascertain at present. So the scrip
should only be purchased with the long-
term in mind. A study of the com-
pany's expansion plans in each annual
report would be the best way to keep an
eye on the expansion rate.
If further expansion is contemplated
for 1965-66, there may not be enough
liquid cash to finance it and an issue
may be necessary. This would violate
the natural “brake” built in to the
financial structure, so directors are more
likely to avoid such measures and
finance growth with loan capital or for-
get it altogether for 12 months.
Ordinary capital has been steady since
listing, while loan capital and reserves
have jumped overall, once again reflect-
ing growth. The easing in loan capital
in the latest year is a healthy sign. The
big slice for outside shareholders arises
because the motels, which are 50 p.c.
owned, have all been incorporated in the
consolidated accounts. (While this may
be contrary to the clauses of the Com-
panies Act it does, nevertheless, give a
slightly more accurate picture of the
overall position, - especially where co-
ownership is the rule and not the excep-
tion and where the co-owner is an indi-
vidual, not another company.)
Profits and earning rates have been
necessarily mediocre so far. The lower
1963-64 result was a result of the
establishment losses incurred at Warr-
nambool, Shepparton and Jindabyne, all
of which are operating profitably now.
These will all boost the current year’s
result considerably, although any im-
provement is likely to be offset or even
outweighed by the new ventures getting
under way. This depends on how long
they are open before the year closes
(some have started business already)
but, on the whole, it seems that overall
profit performance will not be very
spectacular.
The following year should see the first
signs of substantial improvement, de-
pending on what establishment costs
have to be borne. They must get lighter
with time even if expansion comes on
a larger scale, as there will be an in-
creasing number of profit-making units
to back the group up.
Dividends have been generous since
listing, from three points of view. First,
in the light of the need for expansion-
ary money, second, in relation to the
earning rates and third as compared to
the original prospectus, which predicted
payouts of only 8 p.c.
To sum up: considering the ss. shares
can be bought for only Bs., yielding an
attractive 6 p.c. or so from the dividend
after brokerage, buying would be wise
just now. But investors must be pre-
pared to treat the investment as a long-
term one, preferably anything from two
years and on. There is a remote chance
for an issue later this year, but this is
for the speculators only, especially as
the current year’s result is unlikely to
be outstanding. Shareholders will bene-
fit no end, eventually. At present they
should do little else but sit on the nest.

STEEL MILLS LTD
Reinforcing the Earnings
Oteel Mills Ltd has restored its divi-
•. dend to a 10 p.c. rate after two
years of reduced earnings. Now that
the production reorganisation is com-
plete, the company should prove even
more attractive to investors.
It was formed in 1954 and floated
with a public issue of 400,000 10s.
shares at par. The object was to operate
a light rolling mill at Villawood, pro-
ducing the lighter and more complicated
steel sections and shapes not usually
rolled by the larger steel works. Com-
mercial production began in 1956.
Profit-earning history during the next
five years showed a gradual improve-
ment, except for a setback in 1959
caused by keen competition which led
to a sharp fall in selling prices.
In 1961, the company faced a crisis
when the giant BHP began rolling
similar products. In order to cope with
this threat, directors decided to move
into the field of steel reinforcing mesh.
Shareholders were asked to contribute
additional funds with a l-for-4 issue.
The 10s. shares had been split into ss.
units and the new issue was made at a
premium of 4s. Paid capital was lifted
from £266,503 to the present £333,129.
The company’s rolling mill was closed
down gradually. All redundant equip-
ment was eventually sold last year.
Following the clearing of this equip-
ment, the layout of the reinforcing steel
shop was rearranged, resulting in a
considerable increase in output and
efficiency.
The changeover was not without its
upsets. In 1963, the first year in which
the full effect of the change, made its
presence felt, earnings were almost
halved, from £70,375, equal to 26.4 p.c.
on capital, to £37,845 (11.4 p.c.). Divi-
dend was cut from 10 p.c. to 8 p.c.
Earnings last year showed a good im-
provement, yet despite a 44 p.c. lift in
profit to £53,112, equal to 15.9 p.c. on
capital, dividend was maintained at 8
p.c. However, the improvement has

continued into the current year and
directors have already indicated restora-
tion of the 10 p.c. annual rate with an
interim 5 p.c.
On present indications 1964-65 earn-
ings should approach the 1962 result,
although, with local steel in short supply,
the company had to import quantities at
some cost. These additional expenses
were carried in the 1963-64 year, but
selling prices were increased in Septem-
ber with little or no effect on turnover.
The chief users of the company’s pro-
ducts are the road building, reinforced
concrete and construction industries.
With production of all these groups at
a high level and little likelihood of a
falling off in demand, the future appears
bright.
The latest accounts, made up to June
30 last, show the company to be in a
strong position to meet future increases
in business. Liquidity, though, was not
quite as good as in the previous year.
Sank overdraft was up from £79,485 to
£80,788. In addition, the company has
the use of an unsecured loan of £lOO,OOO.
' Reflecting the improvement in busi-
ness, debtors showed a substantial in-
crease from £80,591 to £180,405, while
stock was £38,910 higher at £244,385.
Following a revaluation of freehold,
this item was written up from £125,681
to £221,649. Against this was charged
the loss on the sale of the rolling plant,
which caused the fall in the value of
plant from £216,700 to £167,420.
Nevertheless there was a surplus left
to be transferred to capital reserves,
which now stand at £87,417. These in-
clude £51,080 in share premiums, giving
the company scope for a one-for-four
bonus when earnings permit. With all in-
tangible items written out of the books
several years ..ago, the net assets backing
of each ss. share based on book value
is Bs. 6d.
Current unsettled prices may still offer
prospect of capital improvement, par-
ticularly as another strong rise in pro-
fit in the current year brings closer the
likelihood of a bonus.

SPECULATORS DIARY
Taking a Middle Course
Not so easy on the bandwaggon
T ittle did I know that Mr A. C.
Goode would agree with my words
of advice about a cautionary examina-
tion of the present market.
A Press release last Wednesday told
us that when opening his Canberra
office, Mr Goode was so enthusiastic
that he reckoned all investors “should
not hesitate to climb on to the market
bandwaggon before it rolls too quickly
for them to be able to do little more than
shout after it”. Unfortunately the band-
waggon now looks as though it tem-
porarily has slipped into reverse gear!
It seems almost a case of being naive
to expect the market to recover as
quickly as it has fallen. More likely it
will be a case of the market using the
stairs to go up, as opposed to the
express lift in which it came down.
The fall is an anticipation that most
of the uncertainties facing the economy
will turn out unfavorably. Let us assume
that everything does go wrong. We may
see the drought dragging on and carving
into primary production; wool and
sugar prices remaining depressed, and a
scarcity of world markets for our wheat
production. On the other side of the
external trade balance sheet, the high
level of imports may aggravate the trade
deficit. President Johnson’s plans to
control foreign investment could also
make a serious impact. Within the
country, a tight Budget in August
presents the practically certain prospect
of an increase in taxes.
If you go to the other extreme and
assume that the drought does break
shortly, we may see only a moderate
easing in the country’s prosperity.
I myself will take the middle course,
which means a lot of activity for the
week. Good profits were made on two
of last week’s purchases. Steel Mills rose
to 7s. 4d. to give a £l7 gain. The rise
in Brambles rights did not quite match
the Steel Mills performance, yet still
added £8 to the kitty. The Nuttall
transaction also worked out well with
a £l6 profit.
Then came the necessity to face up to
some losses. The ISAS (NSW) par issue
has backfired on me. Rather than bring-
ing in buyers it has created a battery of
sellers. Quitting both the shares and the
rights meant a loss of £74. This was
hard to swallow.
Almost as disastrous was the sale of
200 King Island Scheelite at 11s. 9d.
The falling wolfram price some time
ago was the danger signal, though I was
slow to catch it.
A further reduction in the portfolio
was the sale of the 500 Kolotex at the
same price I had bought them four
months ago.
Some of these surplus funds were used
to buy 400 Tableland Tin at 30s. 9d.
Late last year these shares were close to
505., having since tumbled to their
present level. Surprisingly the world tin
price has been creeping up and now
stands firm around the £stgl3oo mark.
Tableland’s last profit of £132,000
should be eclipsed in the current year,
both because of an increase in production
and the very much higher average tin
price ruling for the year. Already a
dividend of 2s. a share for the first half-
year has been paid, so a total 20 p.c.
dividend for the full year seems likely.
The final transaction for the week was
the shorting of 500 Boral at 265. A
vague interim report with no specific
measure of profits could upset the market
a few more shillings.
Transactions for the week were:

500 Kolotex, 15/- £366

THE MAN ON THE LAND
Farmers Drive Towards Unity
Wool issues may galvanise the apathetic
T et’s assume for a moment that the
reserve price wool plan agreed to
by Federal Cabinet wins approval at
the Australian Wool Industry Conference
and at the referendum of growers. It may
not, of course. Cabinet apparently thinks
that woolgrowers should contribute more
financial backing for the plan than en-
visaged by the Wool Board when it pro-
posed it.
Another bone of contention will be the
matter of who gets the vote. Should a
man owning only a thousand sheep get
an equal vote with a man owning ten
thousand? Another factor must be the
outcome of the Logan Downs challenge
to the validity of the wool promotion
levy. If Logan Downs wins, then wool-
growers will have to contribute less for
promotion and may feel inclined to pro-
vide more financial backing for the re-
serve plan. If, on the other hand, Logan
Downs loses, then growers may not feel
so happy about providing extra money to
finance the reserve plan.
But, for the sake of argument, let’s
assume that all these things are settled
and the plan comes into being. The objec-
tion to the reserve plan (in this writer's
view the only important one) will also
come into being, namely, greater govern-
ment participation in the affairs of the
traditionally independent wool industry.
It has been said before, and it is
worth repeating, that the “traditional in-
dependence” is largely illusory. Never-
theless it cannot be entirely discounted.
However you look at it, the statutory
authority which will set the reserve prices
will be under a measure of government
control. It has to be. What will happen
then?
This writer believes that the iogical
outcome will be N a welding together of
primary producers, to protect themselves
against bureaucracy, in a way that has
never happened before. This is not a
guess. The seeds of real farmer unity are
already showing signs of sprouting.
The tremendous power of a solidly
united farmer organisation in this country
cannot be overstated. The power such a
body would have would be tremendous
that’s the right word in this case.
Some 200,000 farmers, each on an
average possessing assets of, say, £40,000,
would, by simple arithmetic, form them-
selves into a union (or industrial group,
if that sounds better) with assets totalling
£BOOO million. They would make the
AMA, or the Ironworkers, or the Federa-
ted Clerks, look like pie-eaters.
This business of farmer unity is well
beyond the theory stage. Some people
in the political sphere, who know what is
going on behind the scenes,, are both
interested and worried.
Consider the following extract from the
“Parliamentary and Legislative Review”,
a news-sheet which circulates amongst
members (and other interested persons)
at the State Houses of Parliament in
Victoria:
“The State Government must be watch-
ing with some interest moves to bring all
major farmer organisations together with
a common policy and aims.
“There is no doubt that unity between
the organisations, some of whom have
been warring for years, would be viewed
with some apprehension.
“The organisations wield a fair amount
of political power as it is; but as a single,
united body they would, virtually be
irresistible, politically.
“For example, the Wheat and Wool-
growers’ Association is incensed at the
new State tax of £1 on every £lOO on
new vehicle sales and its repeal is certain
to be demanded at the association’s con-
ference next month.
“If this issue were to be taken up by
' one body representing thousands of Vic-
torian farmers, including a number in
Parliament itself, the Government would
find itself acutely embarrassed. However,
although the unity moves are growing,
there seems little prospect at present of
the various organisations relinquishing
their separate identities and their own
comparatively small but vocal political
pressures.”
This puts the position in its right per-
spective, at present. The four farmer
organisations in Victoria the Graziers’
Association, the Wheat and Woolgrowers’
Association, the Australian Primary Pro-
ducers’, and the Dairy Farmers’ Associa-
tion usually do agree to differ on most
things. To bring them really together it
would need a major happening, a really
big item, and the reserve price plan for
wool could be just that.
This writer is neither attempting to


defend nor denigrate the plan. All he is
attempting to do is to predict what could
happen.
Victoria is probably a little further
advanced in the move towards farmer
unity than the other States. There has
been in existence, for three years, a study
group made up of representatives of the
four farmer organisations. ' They have
been looking at the problem of producing
a draft constitution for a single-body Vic-
torian Farmers’ Union which, in the
overall plan, would have counterparts in
the other States.
Overall, the National Farmers’ Union,
a progression from the existing NFU
and not necessarily that exact body,
would be the supreme body. This is the
body which governments, and industries,
would have to reckon with.
Part and parcel of the draft proposi-
tion is that the supreme NFU would be
a body equipped in every way to conduct
matters for farmers in the Arbitration
Court, at tariff inquiries and at industrial
hearings.
Squabblings between the ,four bodies
does go on. Right now the chairman of
the study group, Mr Wilfred Weigall, is
accusing the Wheat and Woolgrowers of
throwing a spanner in the works. The
chief president of the Wheat and Wool-
growers, Mr P. J. Meehan, has hit back
and has accused Mr Weigall of being a
“tool of the Graziers’ Association”.
“We are firmly behind unity,” says Mr
Meehan, “but we will have no part of
a hotchpotch constitution and that’s what
the draft constitution is a hotchpotch.”
Most of the dissension at the moment,
and this is significant, hinges on structu-
ral aspects. These include the number of
branches, the number of industry divi-
sions (grains, wool, meat, etc.), the rela-
tive powers of each, and, presumably,
who will get the biggest say when the
Victorian Farmers’ Union eventually
comes into being.
The APPU and the Wheat and Wool-
growers have big numbers, but the
Graziers have plenty of money. The
Dairy Farmers have both numbers and
money.
It will take some sorting out but, if the
issue is big enough, none of these things
appear insurmountable. As this writer
sees it, the question is not “will it happen”
but “when will it happen?” The wool
issue, if it does result in greater govern-
ment control (or fear of control), is not
the only thing which could hasten the
cause of farmer unity.
Other matters which might have the
same end result might be:
• Government action to restrict wheat
acreages.
• Government moves to reduce the
annual amounts paid in dairy prices
stabilisation.
• Government inability to check rising
costs for manufactured items necessary to
the farmer.
• An urban-minded government, bow-
ing to pressure from the 90 p.c. of Aus-
tralians who live in cities, bringing in
restrictions on the taxation benefits ac-
corded primary producers.
• In short, any government moves
which might make the primary producer
worse off by comparison with people
engaged in secondary industry.
The great stumbling block to unity
jealousies between the existing primary
producer organisations will lessen with
or without the impact of some major
happening. The younger generation of
farmers now and again indicates that it is
getting tired of the old hierarchy of
farm leaders. This younger generation is
noticeably responsive to the idea of one
unified farm organisation.
Just the same, the outcome of the cur-
rent wool issue could be the big stick
which will galvanise the reluctant and the
apathetic into really doing something
about unity.
Changing Order of Things
Lawrence Simpson joins the AWIC
old order changeth, if slowly.
Mr Lawrence Simpson has become
a delegate from the United Farmers and
Woolgrowers’ Association of NSW to the
Australian Wool Industry Conference.
And has thereby confounded his de-
tractors.
They said he would never make it.
They said he was a turncoat who had
left the Graziers’ Association and who
would, therefore, be forever suspect.
(Ignoring the fact that quite a few
notable figures in history have been
turncoats.)
Well, the United Farmers has nomi-
nated Simpson and he will take his
place on the Wool Industry Conference
when the new batch of delegates assumes
office in a couple of months’ time.
As far as this writer can discover, Mr
Simpson is breaking new ground. No
one in the past has ever left an im-
portant office in the Graziers’ Associa-
tion to win for himself an important
office in the United Farmers. It just
isn't done.
The reverse procedure—going from
the United Farmers to the Graziers
has been done, of course. But that’s
different (why?).
In the natural order of things, Simp-
son gravitated to the Graziers’ Associa-
tion when he first entered the politics of
his industry, woolgrowing. He was,
after all, a grazier (i.e., squatter) type.
Big property, Geelong Grammar, all that
sort of thing. Fair hair, too. “Batman”
made a good point in The Bulletin
some time ago about Geelong Grammar
types always having fair hair. Goodness
knows why, but they always do.
Of course Geelong Grammar has its
detractors, too. But you do not qualify
as a Geelong Grammar detractor if you
complain that the fees are so high that
only about two p.c. of the population
has a chance of getting an education
thfere. You do qualify, though, if you
assert that half the teachers there are
Communists. It’s a kind of game.
Simpson, having emerged from Gee-
long Grammar as someone who could
obviously think for himself, eventually
became president of the Jerilderie
branch of the Graziers’ Association.
Then he withdrew into a wilderness (of
his own making) to write and talk un-
ceasingly on the lack of what he termed
“sensible marketing” of wool.
He was too young to take any part in
the post-JO reserve price referendum,
and all that went with it, in 1951. He
came in fresh, about six years ago, and
began a one-man crusade. But from
a distance. He called, and paid for, his
own meetings, bought his own radio
time and advertising space, published
his own booklets, and flooded editors
all over the country with articles.
The Wool Board is in favor of reserve
price selling now; at that time it wasn’t.
Its chairman, Sir William Gunn, was
always in favor of reserve price, but,
being a natural-born politician, had to
go along with his Board. He could not
have stayed chairman had he not.
When the Board changed its mind,
Gunn was able to come out into the
open. Yet although Simpson and Gunn
are now both saying the same thing
(with the exception that Gunn supports
heavy promotion whereas Simpson does
not), the breach between the two is
deep indeed.
Simpson has taken Gunn to task many
times and Gunn has always been able
to write him off as a lone wolf trouble-
maker because of Simpson's lack of
official standing. Now Simpson has got
official standing—UFWA delegate to the
Wool Industry Conference. It may
prove highly interesting. Some licking
of chops is going on already.
Simpson's acceptance by the UFWA
does indicate that the old divisions may
be going. Most people would agree
that it would be a good thing if they
did. The industry is too big and too
important to be forever divided by sta-
tus symbols tracing back to the 19th
century. In any case the lines of social

distinction are incredibly bewildering
these days. You can find plenty of
UFWA members owning bigger proper-
ties than some Graziers’ Association
members.
Sir William Gunn is Graziers’ Asso-
ciation, went to King’s, yet he has put
forward a “small man’s” reserve price
scheme. But, then, he’s got black hair
(poor-show school) and, besides, he’s
from Queensland. A Queensland squat-
ter isn’t quite, you know, the same
thing.
The clash between Gunn
and Simpson on the floor of the Wool
Industry Conference (the “parliament of
the wool industry”) may sot eventuate.
One way or another it seems that the
wool marketing issue will be settled
within six months or so. There are
persistent rumors that Sir William, once
this is settled, would like a change.
These are rumors, tio more and no less.
A fact, though, is that his favorite
public relations man isn’t working on
wool matters at all now but on some-
thing else altogether. It’s anyone’s guess
what it is; but it isn’t wool.
Set Stocking for Sheep
Humanity must join efficiency
Tt might not be a bad idea if some
thought were given to what should,
and what should not, be allowed to hap-
pen to animals in the name of science.
If a man starves a dog, or a horse, in
a backyard he runs the risk of a fine.
Rightly so. Most people would agree
that the fines should be stiffer than they
are. But what happens if a group of
highly-trained, highly-respectable farm-
ing scientists deliberately starve large
flocks of sheep so that, at a chosen time,
they may be released to “efficiently”
graze a set area of grass?
Obviously nothing can happen which
might be termed an official, or legal,
reprimand. What does happen, how-
ever, is that those practical farmers who
dislike the cruelty, involved further stiffen
their resistance to the findings of scien-
tific experiment. The gulf between the
academic and the traditionalist widens.
This, perhaps even more than the suffer-
ing of the stock, is the tragedy of it all.
It may be that there is no real suffer-
ing. But enough people think there is
to warrant a closer look. In some
quarters of scientific thought in Australia
set stocking is held as the panacea for
the sheep industry. The scientists argue,
of course, that there is no real cruelty in-
volved; that the sheep are merely put on
a “starvation diet” and that they would
never be permitted to actually become
dangerously weak.
On the other hand, critics of the sys-
tem argue that “set stocking” is, in itself,
a misleading definition and that it should
be rightly called “starvation stocking”.
Some critics allege they have seen sheep
literally keeling over from lack of food
during the starvation period.
In a strictly results-speak-for-them-
selves sense, set stocking, or starvation
stocking, looks a neat operation. A
property run in this manner makes the
most economical use of available feed
because nothing is wasted.
If they are hungry enough sheep will
eat just about anything. So, when re-
leased from the starvation period (in a
yard or very small and bare paddock),
the sheep will eat off weeds, rushes,'
shrubs and any other normally non-
utilised source of feed.
By fencing the entire property info
small paddocks and introducing set
stocking there is little doubt, in the
scientific sense, that efficiency is im-
proved. After the initial fencing there
is not much more labor involved than
on a normal property.
This is where set stocking differs from
zero grazing, in which animals are kept
in a confined area and cut hay, or silage,
is brought to them from the more
distant paddocks. Zero grazing obvi-
ously entails fairly expensive equipment
and a labor force.

Which panel is "Perspex’?
The camera can’t tell, and that makes it tough for you to pick it. But we can
tell you this clear ‘Perspex’ acrylic sheet permits transmission of 92%
of visible light; that’s a higher factor than glass. Let’s also consider that
depending on the required degree of diffusion and light intensity, there are
special grades of ‘Perspex’ which give maximum performance.
Add to this, the fact that ‘Perspex’ allows complete freedom of design, that it’
lighter, stronger and safer than glass, and you have some pretty good reasons
why 1.C.1. ‘Perspex’ acrylic sheet is today’s outstanding product for lighting.
