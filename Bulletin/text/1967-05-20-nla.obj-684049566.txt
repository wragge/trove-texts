WYNNS
ESTATE
WINE
The wine growers story of favoured vintages.
Coonawarra Estate
’66 Riesling
The success of the Rhine
Riesling vines planted at
Coonawarra Estate is shown
by this wine. Bottled within
six months of vintage, the ’66
Riesling has retained fully
the fresh, slightly ‘spritzig’
Riesling character.
Coonawarra Estate
’63 Hermitage
The ripening period of 1963
at Coonawarra was
unusually humid, which
seems to have added
subtlety to the wine, giving
it greater delicacy, yet
with a deeply satisfying full
flavour. It may well prove
to be the best Australian
Hermitage ever.
Coonawarra Estate
’62 Cabernet
Following on the 1960
Vintage, (the 1961 Vintage
was a total loss at Coona-
warra Estate) the 1962 is a
bigger wine in which the
oak-maturation and
Cabernet Sauvignon
character form a well
balanced soft symphony of
flavour.
Modbury Estate
’65 Moselle
Riesling grapes vintaged
early in March result in a
light, delicate wine with all
the best characteristics of a
true Moselle. An undertone
of soft fruitiness adds an
intriguing characteristic
which will appeal to those
who prefer a crisp, not too
dry, white wine.
Ovens Valley
’62 Burgundy
A fine, big Northern
Victorian wine grown from
Shiraz, pressed and matured
in oak for three years. Now,
after bottle-ageing, this soft,
smooth Burgundy is being
released from Wynns. It is a
superb example of the big
wines produced in this area.
Modbury Estate
’65 White Burgundy
Semillion grapes, grown on
gently-contoured Northern
slopes, and expert care have
produced this full, rich
White Burgundy. The ap-
pealing fragrance and flavour
of this vintage earns it pride
of place in any cellar.

Modern Motor Readers' Poll, 1967
Winner BEST LUXURY COMPACT category
ROVER 2000
Thi s (me,
we expected to win.
Modern Motor Readers' Poll, 1967
Winner BEST ALL-ROUNDER category
ROVER 2000
This raie
surprised even us!
Know why?
In the ‘Best Luxury Compact’ section of Modern Motor’s
readers’ poll, we had some fairly healthy competition:
Cars like the □ Daimler 2.5 □ Jaguar 3.8 S and
□ Lancia Flaminia, plus the □ Chrysler Regal □ Fiat
2300 □ Falcon Fairmont □ Holden Premier □ Nissan
Cedric De Luxe and the □ Triumph 2000. Still, we
weren’t too surprised to win this one. It was winning the
“Best All-rounder” category that really tickled us. For
this was the question asked: “Which current model,
regardless of cost, would you choose as the best all-round
car?” You know, we really expected people to go for the
Rolls. We really did. Or perhaps, since the Bond epics,
the Aston Martin DB6. But no, our Rover 2000 took it
out comfortably. Seems that the average Australian
motorist agrees with the' motoring authorities and writers
around the world who have heaped laurels on the Rover
2000 to the point of making us blush. Of course, this was
Rover’s avowed intention when they created the 2000
to make it the ultimate “all-round” car. Not just a mag-
nificently-appointed luxury car. Not just a rip-roaring
sports car. Not just a long-loping, mile-eating G.T. car.
Not just the world’s safest car. Not any single one of these
but all of them. If you’ve never before driven four cars
simultaneously, you’ve a treat in store. How about today?

BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
Met any good,
used football
players lately?
IT HAS BEEN an awfully good start
to the footy season. Mr. Gough Whit-
lam came down here and had him-
self fitted out in a Collingwood foot-
ball guernsey. What’s more he had
himself presented with a Collingwood
badge which he wore in his lapel. How
sensible he was to do this. Most poli-
ticians understand the serious import-
ance of Melbourne football with the
electorate. After all, Sir Robert, a very
canny fellow, has always been number
one at Carlton. Arthur Calwell has
always been a good North Melbourne
man.
But there’s the difference, you see.
Gough Whitlam has been far smarter.
Collingwood is the biggest club, and,
as was said at the time, he’s getting
“with the strength.”
What else has happened this year?
You know the old practice in America
of having baby’s first pair of booties
“permanised.” You don’t? Well, in
New York it is quite the thing. For
$lO or so you can have baby’s booties
permanised in bronze, “every lovable
wrinkle preserved forever.” Then the
thing to do is to hang them from the
rear-vision mirror of the car or put
them on top of the telly.
Now this can be done in Melbourne,
but nobody is interested in baby’s
booties. We have made a natural cul-
tural progression befitting our city.
The news is that you can buy footy
boots permanised in a coating of cop-
per. So if you have in the family/ a
great football hero, who is at last
hanging up his boots, you can have
them permanised in copper, preserving
every lovable wrinkle. The great booths
of Ray Gabelich, former captain of
Gough Whitlam’s Collingwood, have
been permanised and put on display
at Foys.
The other interesting thing that has
happened this season is this: we now
buy and sell footballers. Even two or
three years ago the very mention of
the words “transfer fee” would have
shocked League officials to the backs
of their guernseys. It’s like incest,
everyone knows it goes on, but it is
never mentioned in polite society.
The Coulter Law, which forbids the
buying and selling of footballers, came
into force in 1930. It never quite
stopped trade, but one had to purchase
one’s footballer with the utmost dis-
cretion. You formed your select group
of rich patrons, or “the coterie” as one
club calls it. Then to get your man you
offered him a house, a Holden, a seat
on the board of BHP, depending on
his quality, but never doing anything
as unseemly as making it a straight
cash transaction.
The Coulter Law is still in force, but
this year, apparently by some sort of
mute agreement, everybody has decided
it doesn’t matter any more. Indeed,
rather than keep the matter a secret,
it is considered pretty good public
relations to leak out the transfer fee.
It is like being the star boy at MGM,
the leading Merseyside group, or the
president of General Motors, and it is
quite the thing to announce how much
money you are earning. So the transfer
fee to the fans is the symbol of success.
Would you like a little bit of a price
list? The price for the Latrobe Valley
League Bairnsdale recruit, Michael
Redenback, was $5OO. Fitzroy had to
pay $BOO to get Alec Ruscuklic from
Morwell. Fitzroy had to hand over
$2OOO to get back their former captain,
Kevin Murray, from Western Aus-
tralia.
The Victorian Football Association
has laid down a minimum price of
$3OOO for a transfer to the Victorian
Football League. This has caused a
total breakdown in relations between
the VFL and the VFA. There is a move
to make $4OO the standard payment for
a transfer from the country leagues, but
the real transfer of the year is Peter
Hudson, the new Hawthorn full-
forward.
Peter Hudson was a sort of dream
“We’re buying him on the instalment
plan...!”
full-forward who had kicked hundreds
of goals for New Norfolk, Tasmania.
New Norfolk laid down a flat price to
Hawthorn of $lO,OOO. Much bargaining
went on and the general opinion is that
Hudson exchanged hands for $BOOO.
Some say he was bought on a fine old
time-payment system $2OOO down
and $lOO weekly. If this is true, Haw-
thorn had better keep up their pay-
ments, or suddenly at 2.15 p.m. one
Saturday afternoon, 10, the New Nor-
folk bailiffs will appear outside the
dressing-room and Peter Hudson will
be repossessed.
Regrettably, Mr. Hudson is not kick-
ing a great many goals at the moment
and he is costing about $lOOO a goal,
but that is another story.
Batman believes that it is a very good
thing that all this has come into the
open. The Coulter Law was designed
to protect the poorer clubs, but curi-
ously enough it is the poorer clubs which
have been most aggressive in trying to
buy new players. Perhaps we may soon
switch to the American system where
millionaires or well-heeled actors like
Gene Autry buy and finance baseball
teams. Instead of having a Dame Pattie
syndicate we might have a Fitzroy
syndicate. Instead of Mr. Aubrey Gib-
son pouring his money into the National
Gallery he might pour his money into
North Melbourne or Footscray.
Alf Brown, of the “Herald,” even
compared the sale of footballers to the
sale of used cars. This would be a very
good idea. Somewhere out on the Pt.
Nepean Highway we could set up a
Used Footballer Lot. The footballers
could be labelled “one owner,” “slightly
used,” “A 1 warranty,” “only handled
by small country club suffered only
minor damage.” However, one would
expect, used footballers to be in clean
condition, cartilages in good shape, and
possessing the right number of ears.
There would be a fixed scale for de-
preciation. A footballer who had been
out on the road for 30 years could not
expect to fetch as much as a smart,
new, polished footballer of only 20. We
would keep a doctor on hand to give
a sort of RACV inspection service for
buyers, and Custom Credit would be
on hand to provide easy terms.
Any teams that were over strong in
one department or weak in another
could do good business through the
Used Footballer Lot. You may smile at
all this, but Victorian Football could
do with a little lift.
There’s one aspect that does not get
much publicity. Despite all the ballyhoo,
immense coverage on TV, and even
permanised footy boots, attendance does
not go up. Actually it goes down. Here
are the total attendance figures for the
first four rounds for the past five years:
1963, 701,666; 1964, 660,069; 1965,
577,324; 1966, 663,853; 1967, 590,326.
Some of these figures were boosted by
split rounds but it is still interesting
that despite rising populations and new
grounds, 1963 was the best year and
1967 is the second worst.

Crustiness in a
place that's
all so apple-pie
BY DAPHNE GUINNESS
ELEVENSES AT Scott’s: hot, steaming
meat pies oozing black-brown gravy,
tea served in the company’s best china,
“Now what do you say about our
beautiful, succulent pies, eh?” Dr,
Antony Norst, their food technologist,
quivers with anticipation. He is Vien-
nese and quivers beautifully. Mr. Arthur
Tolano, their manager, removes his eyes
for one second from the apple pie he
cut in half to prove the fruit is whole.
Peter Scott, nephew of managing dir-
ector and chairman, Uncle Kitchener,
munches meat and gravy like a half-
starved pie fanatic. He says it is his
breakfast.
The ceremony is in Mr. Tolano’s
office, a suitably gravy-colored place
with, for light relief, a print of Pieter
Breughel The Elder’s “Country Wed-
ding” on the wall, wherein the guests
are in the throes of a pie-eating orgy.
Dr. Norst imported this object of
scenic delight and thinks the expressions
on their faces are out of this world.
They knew what was good for them
in the 16th century. Which was more
than he could say about someone in
the 20th century well, someone’s nose,
then.
The piece of anatomy to which Dr.
Norst refers has, until now, earned
nothing but praise for its incredible
sensitivity. It has what might be called
a sixth sense that can pick up things
such as the smell of escaping gas which
the more humdrum nostrils miss. Its
owner does not care to boast, but she
believes there are several people alive
now who would be otherwise had she
not detected fumes of this nature.
Anyway, down at the Easter Show
this year, the same nose was assaulted
by the smell of Scott’s pies (1000 dozen
shifted at each window outlet, no
wonder), a fact which was duly re-
corded in The Bulletin. This hurt Dr.
Norst, who has grown to love the aroma
during his 11 years with the firm •
well, either that or he has become im-
mune to it and a visit to the Leich-
hardt bakehouse where 70 staff produce
anything from 600 to 1000 dozen pies
a day would, he suggested, put things
right. At any rate, its concentration of

smells would be jolly good exercise for
the nose.
There was a concentration of smells,
the first being strong coffee, but we
let that slide. A reputation for facetious-
ness is not desirable. Behind a heavy
steel door, Quality Control let forth
spices and herbs in a strength this nose
has never before encountered. There
is a girl here measuring everything out
in equal quantities. She does not smile.
No says Dr. Norst, it is not possible
for the wrong amount to be put in his
pies. Well, all right, it could happen,
but it would be discovered pronto! No
smell worth mentioning in Mixing

of pipes to Pie Casings on the floor
beneath, and what’s left is hosed away
by a gentleman from Poland. We rushed
into Sausage Rolls, which broke down
at our appearance. It would, says Dr.
Norst. The machine is English. He
allowed a quick word with Cornish
Pasties, but she, unfortunately, spoke
only Greek. Where does all the wastage
go? To the pigman, says Dr. Norst.
The Dough Room next, with a re-
quest for “SILENCE” on the wall,
and a flour-scattered floor like an ice-
rink. We skid round the pastry tables
and receive a lecture on the merits of
Puff versus Short. Thence down a floor
where the Fillings come out, pastry
lids snapped on, and an egg mixture
sprayed overall for shining, yellow pies.
This smell hit the nose hard. Dr. Norst
moved quickly to the ovens, then past
Packing, working flat out to meet
schools’ demands, and back again to
the office.
The unveiling of the pies took place
after a lady had staggered in with two
heavy trays, each covered with tissue
paper. She left Mr. Tolano to do the
honors. He removed the paper with a
flourish, lifted out a large round pie,
and swung it in a circle for everyone
to admire. It is an emotional moment.
We are at a loss for words. Mr. Tolano,
playing it for all he is worth, picks
up a large, vicious-looking, black-
handled knife and cuts the pie clean in
half “. . . and that,” he says, “is our
new platter pie. I guarantee you won’t
find another apple pie like it in the
whole of New South Wales.”
Maybe not. But Dr. Norst is agitated.
Listen to him and his platter pies. What
about the meat pies, eh? Let’s get on
with those. With breakfast barely
settled in the stomach it is difficult to
eat half a pie, and downright danger-
ous to tackle a sausage roll. Anyway,
after comments and criticisms, Mr.
Tolano wisely decided not to pass round
the apple pie. He could see we had had
enough. “Funny,” said Peter Scott out
of the blue, “John Pearce was here the
other morning and he ate a ton of pies.
He said he’d got a hangover, and they
seemed to cure it.”
Scott’s are now toying with the idea
of going into doughnuts.

MARION RAYMOND’S
COOK BOOK
There's more than
one way to handle
a hot potato
WHEN FIRST SEEN by Europeans in
the Andes about 1537, the potato was
thought to be a truffle. But once Sir
Francis Drake discovered it to be the
staple diet of the Indians in Southern
Chile it practically became the main-
stay of the western world.
Potatoes are unimposing to look at.
No one could guess that such a plain
vegetable could cause so much trouble
and strife. It or its absence has
caused riots, famines, and even wars.
Today, there are several hundred
varieties grown in the world. They
differ in appearance and skin color,
textures, times of harvesting, and in
their varying resistance to diseases.
What is a good spud in one area can
be poor in another. When I was a
child I could buy a pennyworth of
chips on the way to the pictures
and when I got home I was so full
I couldn’t eat my dinner.
Nowadays, five cents will barely pay
for one potato, and a packet of cold
potato chips can cost 20 cents so
the truffle theory might not have been
so wide of the mark after all.
Now that prices have placed potatoes
on a higher social plane I think we
should forget about serving boiled,
mashed, or chipped spuds they
never were very exciting prepared in
those ways in any case and elevate
their status on the menu. (Of course,
if they are meant to fill in the gaps,
or stretch the dinner from four to six,
as in some countries, that’s another
matter.)
One electrifying entree for a dinner
party requires a large potato per per-
son, a packet of sour cream, and a
jar of caviar. Bake the potatoes in their
jackets in foil, with a dab of butter
and some pepper and salt. An hour
and a half later, when they’re cooked,
slice off the tops, scoop out the inside,
mash with butter, salt and pepper, and
some very finely chopped shallots.
Add sufficient sour cream to make
a smooth mixture and tip in the jar
of caviar last of all, being careful not
to break the globules. Refill potatoes
and return to the oven to heat through
5-10 minutes then serve.
Once, in Portugal, we stayed in a
small pensao, or boarding-house, at the
foothills of the mountains of Sintra.

There were no hotels there at the time,
and it was the only place in the area
that put up visitors. We had intended
“ stav for a fortnight, but the weeks
extended into months. The food was
s 0 good, and in all the weeks we
stayed there we rarely ate the same
meal twice.
Only one thing recurred on the
menu frequently a potato soup; a
soup so good that we almost prayed
to see it appear again and again. Here
is the recipe:
Make a pint and a half of good
meat stock. (This is one soup where
nrepared stock cubes are better not
used.) Boil 21b. of mealy potatoes in
salted water until soft. Strain and mash.
Add to strained stock. This will keep
in the refrigerator for days until re-
quired. When you want to eat it, heat,
stir in a little fresh cream, add some
finely chopped parsley, and serve with
crisply fried and crumbled bacon or
garlic sippets (cubed stale bread fried
until golden with crushed garlic).
If this is the beginning of your meal
don’t serve potatoes with the main
course, will you?
When I was a child in Europe we
once had a Viennese cook. She hated
my mother, and my mother returned
the compliment. But she was such a
good cook that my mother very wisely
put up with her until she learned most
of her repertoire.
Naturally, my mother required her
to make the most complicated dishes
as often as possible, but the cook s
favorite pastime (to break the monotony
of preparing rich foods, I suppose) was
to make Kartoffel Puffer for her own
consumption and my delight. To
this day I can eat these potato pan-
cakes on their own, or with a good
meat stew.
To make them you need 21b. of large
potatoes. Scrub well, peel thinly, and
grate them coarsely. Drain off the water
and add sufficient flour and milk to
make a thick batter. Add two well-
beaten eggs and season. Have a hot
frying pan ready and fry each pancake
individually. Stack on absorbent paper
and keep warm in the oven until ready
to serve.
I’ve got nothing against mashed
potatoes, by the way, but they get
monotonous. The addition of 2 table-
spoons of tomato paste to a bowl of
mashed potatoes is colorful and piquant;
a little cream helps the blend.
A really super way to serve mashed
potatoes is to take the yolks of 4 eggs,
beat them well, add f pint of sour
cream, 2 tablespoons of flour, a pinch
of salt, and set aside. Mash about lOoz.
of cold boiled potatoes. Blend with
cream mixture and stir in 6 tablespoons
of grated cheese. Whip egg-whites until
stiff and fold into mixture last of all.
Butter a deep, round, fireproof dish,
pour in the mixture, and sprinkle with
grated cheese. Bake in a medium-hot
oven for 30 minutes. Now that’s what
I call mashed potato . . .

The binding ties
of Empire
and bookmen
Andre Deutsch
BRITAIN MAY BE prepared to let
go her Commonwealth as lightly as
she forsook her Empire, but British book
publishers believe that the sun will
never set on their traditional British
Empire book market.
That, at least, is the view of one of
them, Mr. Andre Deutsch, recently
here, who is active in British publishers’
associations. The traditional market is
most English-speaking countries except
North America. How it works is hard
to put simply, but it means that Aus-
tralian publishers get rights to American
and European books only when British
publishers don’t want them, or if an
American author sells Australian rights
only, no British publisher will handle
him. This, you might say, is stiff luck
for Australian publishers. However, it
also means that large numbers of titles
are filtered through British publishers
and Australian readers get only what the
British think of interest. We may never
see, say, a .first-class book on South-
East Asia because the British are fairly
lukewarm about that area.
Mr. Deutsch may believe that the
present arrangement is the best of all
possible worlds, but in other ways he
seemed more realistic and outgoing
than most of the long line of British
book publishers who have come here
in recent years to discover what goes
on in this, a substantial section of their
export market; in Mr. Deutsch’s case,
about 25 percent.
Mr. Deutsch travelled part of the
time in tandem with one of his authors,
fellow-Hungarian Mr. George Mikes
(“Everyone,” said Mr. Deutsch, “is
Hungarian”), who is writing the in-
evitable book about Australia.
After about 80 bookshops, and per-
haps as many Hungarians, Mr. Deutsch
was extremely enthusiastic about what
he saw here. He went to every State,
“unlike,” he suggested, “some of my
colleagues,” and to some smaller centres.
He also visited New Zealand.
Mr. Deutsch is an independent pub-
lisher, owning, he says, about 85 per-
cent of his firm, which he calls a
medium, medium size one, publishing
an average of 75 books a year.
He has lived most of his life i n
England and began in publishing during

A 2779
World War 11. At the end of 1944
he decided to go out on his own.
Deutsch at that time was not quite
the name for a British publisher, so
he thought up Allen Wingate. For some
years after he used to receive letters
from various Wingates, asking what
branch of the family he belonged to,
and even sending family trees for him
to mark his spot.
A few years later he bought Norman
Mailer’s “The Naked and the Dead,”
after eight British publishers had turned
it down. This, he says, “exploded” his
firm. “Many publishing firms larger
than mine was have been ruined by a
sudden best-seller,” he said. “I acquired
a larger staff, nice, dilettantish people,
and in August, 1950, I was out of the
firm I had founded. In 1951 I began
again, this time under my own name.
Allen Wingate survived only until
1957.”
Mr. Deutsch bought back some of
his old titles then, including “The
Naked and the Dead.” He still pub-
lishes Mailer, along with other Ameri-
cans, including John Updike. He is
strong on cookery books, publishes
juveniles and a language series, edited
by Eric Partridge.
Mr. Deutsch hopes to get half a
dozen or so books out of his Australian
and New Zealand trip. One will be a
book on Australia with chapters by
various authors, a “mood” or “think”
book, he hopes. He is also planning a
By PATRICIA ROLFE
bibliography of Australian children’s
books. He expects to get two new books
from Vincent Serventy, the naturalist,
already on his lists.
Mr. Deutsch’s enthusiasm was tem-
pered by what he called the “threat”
of American publishers in the field of
tertiary-level educational books in Aus-
tralia. He believes that he and his
fellow British publishers should meet
this “threat” vigorously. “I know the
British tend to be slow,” he said.
“Americans sell, the British take orders,
but we must try harder. I am going to
suggest that they invite a number of
Australian booksellers to Britain next
year and put them thoroughly through
it.
“The American book publishing
industry is quite heavily subsidised by
the U.S. Government,” he said.
“Indirectly, of course, in much the
same way that de Gaulle has subsidised
the French publishers so that French
culture can be spread. And there is
no doubt that trade follows books. At
the university level the Americans are
making quite serious inroads even in
Britain. Can you think of the effect on
a British student of, say, engineering,
who studies American textbooks?”
Mr. Deutsch’s Australian visit may
enable him to ponder the effect on an
Australian student of studying British
textbooks.

Blood streams all
over the
trading floor
“BLOOD WAS ALL OVER the floor
last week as complacent forward sellers
knocked each other around to cover
commitments.” That was the colorful
lead-in used by one of our financial
papers the other day. Had something
at last happened to awaken our Rip
Van Winkle index from its seemingly
unending sleepy doldrums? I’m afraid
not. The article referred to the Wool
Futures Exchange, where life appears
to be lived a little more on the excit-
ing side. This market, however, is not
for the faint-hearted. There, a change
of 1 cent in the wool price sends a
contract, which is the smallest unit
traded, up or down by an impressive
or depressive $30.00.
My own first buy this week was Con-
solidated Metal Products rights. The
company has just taken over W. Brown
& Sons, the largest scrap metal group
in South Australia. It financed the
deal with a one-for-three issue to share-
holders at a hefty premium and a large
private placement with Mount Mor-
gan. The move makes sense. It means
that Consolidated Metal Products
should double its profit and be well
placed for an increase in dividend.
Last year, earning rate on ordinary
capital was 24 percent; this year, even
on the higher capital, it should exceed
30 percent. This type of rate gives a
very robust cover for the 12.5 percent
dividend the company is currently pay-
ing.
A non-buy this week was Mac-
Robertsons. Despite what has certainly
been a poor year, the company’s yo-yo
share prices kept well up. It is once
more in the grips of takeover fever.
This has happened almost as many
times before as the Yanks have won
the America’s Cup. It is a wonder some
type of immunity has not set in. Never-
theless, I must admit that the com-
pany, with its relatively low-earning
rate and high-asset backing, looks a
deliciously tempting takeover proposi-
tion. In fact, one day it probably will
be a tasty mouthful for some hungry
competitor or an overseas group. In the
meantime, to save money and disap-
pointment, I’ll stay out of the stock.
In the past I’ve lost too many dollars
(and pounds) not to have learnt my
lesson on takeover rumors. The school
is too expensive for a refresher course.
An opposite position now seems to
be applying with Amalgamated Hold,
ings. Prices are down near the year’s
lowest point and the final result has
all the earmarks of being a good one
The company’s two main interests
Greater Union Theatres and Australian
Rank Xerox, both look poised for a
bumper year. The movie theatres are
once again enjoying pre-television-type
queues at their box-office windows and
the Xerox office-copying machines seem
to be turning up in an ever-increasing
number of offices.
A company I just couldn’t resist any
longer was Thiess Bros. So I finally
bought in. I know that I mentioned a
few weeks ago, when buying Coal &
Allied, that this stock suffered from
some unpopularity because of its en-
gineering contracts division, but I have
temporarily decided to overlook this
aspect. The way the company’s shares
keep going up, because of its excellent
prospects in coal exporting, have in-
trigued me to a point where I feel I
must “give it a go.”
On a subject to intrigue there was
an announcement I noticed last week
of the registration of a company with
the unlikely name Dial-A-Dog Pty.
Ltd. This was dreamed up by a New-
castle vet and his wife. The company
intends trading in just about every
type of pet imaginable. All the way
from horses right through to canaries
and snakes. 1 know many investors
often feel inclined to dial-a-prayer, but
Dial-A-Dog is fantastic. Perhaps ring-
a-bull or buzz-a-bear would be more
helpful.
Simpson Pope, Waugh & Josephson,
and Australia Hotel were sold off dur-
ing the week. Fortunately all yielded
profits. These stocks were all down on
their year’s peak, which they had only
reached a few weeks earlier, and now
look like weakening. I decided to play
safe.

Is it a sideways sandwich?
An aboriginal painting?
An aerial view of the railway yard?
No. It’s a detail of one of the anodised
aluminium spandrel panels on the new
Northern & Employers Group building
at 446-452 Collins Street, Melbourne.
It’s quite a story. The problem was how
to distinguish this new office from its
neighbours . . . how to make it stand
out from the other tile-and-glass
buildings. The architects (Godfrey &
Spowers Hughes, Mewton & Lobb) had
the idea of translating a series of
spandrel panels into a dramatic, con-
temporary metal sculpture. The metal ?
Tough, light, corrosion-resistant Alcoa
aluminium box extrusion. The extrusion
was cut lengthwise, leaving a burnt
uneven finish. The sections were anodised,
and mounted on Alcoa channel extrusion.
Then the nine panels were fixed to the
southern and eastern walls at mezzanine
floor level. It was a complete success!
Next time you’re in Collins Street, have
a look at this distinguished building.
See what can be done with Alcoa
aluminium and a bit of imagination.

the trend is
to The

Hotel
Here are the reasons why...
The experience of the new man-
agement team is already being
reflected throughout the entire hotel.
The newly decorated rooms and
suites offer the most spacious—and
most gracious—comfort in the city
(yet the rates are comparable with
standard hotels). There are new
catering facilities, new menus
and an enlarged Vintage Cellar.
There is a new look in service:
most friendly, most efficient, yet
most unobtrusive. There are many
extra services now available
such as free parking for house
guests. All these changes have been
subtly blended into the traditional
atmosphere which has long iden-
tified The Australia as Sydney’s dis-
tinguished hotel.

Everyone knows the
remedy, but no one
can stomach it
IT IS DOUBTFUL now that Soccer
in Austra’ia is ever going to be the big
success its enthusiasts have tried to
lead the public to believe. Recently
the senior N.S.W. Soccer Federation
celebrated its tenth birthday with the
reticence of an aging woman who
would rather not be reminded of the
occasion at all. There were no
banquets, no speeches and statements
—in fact, Soccer’s officialdom discreetly
let the event pass without a single
reference to it.
This peculiar attitude was motivated
not so much by Soccer’s modesty but
more by the fact that there was precious
little to celebrate. The game, never
really in robust health in this State,
has been suffering from numerous ail-
ments in recent years. And, far from
being on the road to recovery, many
of the symptoms have not even been
properly diagnosed.
When the N.S.W. Federation was
formed in February, 1957, there was
boundless optimism in the air. The
game’s followers had hoped that after
decades of frustration, caused by mal-
administration, Soccer would finally
strive forward, if not quite dethroning
League then at least giving it a fright.
None of this has happened. After
the initial boom years, over by 1963,
Soccer’s momentum wavered and then
started to peter out. Today Soccer is
no more a challenger to the mighty
League than is lacrosse or cray-
fishing—at least as far as “big-time”
public appeal is concerned.
The reasons are manifold and com-
plex. However, the most vital is that
Soccer, in all these years, has failed to
make up its own mind which market
to cater for. For many years, before the
advent of the Federation, Soccer was
essentially an amateur sport, drawing
small crowds and laying no claims to
international status.
It was predictable that European
migrants would be dismayed by such a
set-up and would, instinctively, try to
change it. Raised in the Soccer-crazy
atmosphere of Europe, they would not
settle for anything less than the best —
or , at any rate, what they hoped would
be the best.
Migrant clubs started to mushroom,
attracting the Dutch, Italians, Hungar-
ians, Yugoslavs, Czechs, Maltese, and
others into various clubs. For the first
few years the Australian district clubs
held their own in this sharp competi-
tion, but eventually, because of their
more amateurish organisation, wilted
and declined.
But now Soccer doesn’t quite know
how to cater for both the Australian
and the migrant population. Despite
many resolutions, nobody has succeeded
even in drawing up an intelligent plan
for the integration of the migrant clubs
into the Australian community, clearly
fearing to lose what they have for what
they only wish to have.
All N.S.W. migrant Soccer clubs still
retain their original names in full or
in part; APIA, Yugal, Croatia, Pan Hel-
lenic, Hakoah, Prague, Melita, and
Polonia, who dominate the scene. True,
some have been given a prefix to their
names to add “local” or “Australian”
favor to their club: Budapest is now St.
George-Budapest, Hakoah is Hakoah-
Eastern Suburbs, Croatia is South
Sydney-Croatia, etc.
How shallow these names are. The
fact is that none of these clubs has
really moved to a district, body and
soul; indeed, it is doubtful whether the
districts concerned are very much inter-
ested in having them at all.
As a result, N.S.W. Soccer suffers
from an acute shortage of grounds.
Few of the major suburban ovals are
ever available to Soccer and most clubs
crowd into the city areas, staging their
games at small fields. The position is
not much better in other States.
What of Soccer’s next ten years?
Some incurable optimists feel that the
game will finally establish itself
throughout Australia. They base their
hope on the rapidly growing number of
juniors—some 65,000 in N.S.W. alone
—and the fact that the code is at last
making successful inroads in public and
private schools, including some GPS
establishments.
There is also constant hope that
soon, possibly within two or three years,
Soccer can form a National League,
embracing at first N.S.W. and Victoria
and gradually incorporating the other
States. This, Soccerites tell you, would
be the only nationally run football code
in the country.
As more and more N.S.W. Soccer
clubs form themselves into fully licensed
clubs, money may soon become more
readily available for development, and
there are not many things in organised
sport that money could not overcome.
Still, Soccer’s chief aim for the
present should be to solve finally the
problem of integrating migrants into
the district communities or, as some
cynics say, integrate the districts into
the migrant clubs. One without the
other cannot possibly succeed; just as a
Soccer field requires two properly
set-up goal posts, the game itself badly
needs a joining of forces. Until that
happens, League has nothing to fear.

Seidler's imports
HARRY SEIDLER, architect of the
Sydney Australia Square project, has
announced with some pride, and appar-
ently with no sense of incongruity, that
art works for the main building of the
project, the “silo,” are to come from
overseas.
These are to be a sculpture by Ameri-
can Alexander Calder and two French
tapestries. If we had known Mr. Seidler
was so keen about tapestries we might
have suggested one from the current
John Olsen exhibition in Sydney, and
we could have told Mr. Seidler how
to get a Calder cheaply. One was with-
drawn from an auction at Geoff Gray’s
last year. It had a reserve price of about
4000 guineas; top bid was 45 guineas.
Doctors anonymous
ONE MEDICAL MYSTERY we feel
even the Australian Medical Association
and doctors themselves can no longer
unravel is the rule about anonymity in
Press and other media. Last week on
television the surgeon in charge of the
spectacularly successful Royal Mel-
bourne Hospital’s kidney transplants
was interviewed, but, the announcer
said he could not give his name “for
ethical reasons.” A few minutes later,
on the same program, another doctor,
name given, was chatting away about
Musak as therapy.
Almost any day you can turn the
pages of a daily paper and see some
doctor fulminating about something
in the letters column under the ethical
pseudonym of “Doctor” or “Medico”
(they are very fond of that). Turn a
few pages and you might see Medico’s
photograph, at a dinner or dance
following some medical congress, with
his name and branch of medicine
dearly set out in the caption. He
couldn’t have a better advertisement if
he wore a sandwich-board.

AS I SEE IT
Looking at certain
unhealthy factors
in the Senate
BY ALAN REID
A MUCH LARGER principle is at
stake in the current House of Repre-
sentatives-Senate wrangle than whether
postal rates are going to rise. At stake
is the principle of whether the Senate,
elected virtually anonymously under a
peculiar voting system in which a single
death can significantly change the
balance of power, or the House of
Representatives, the “popular” House,
is to be the supreme chamber.
The true nature of the dispute
emerges when you realise that postal
charges are going to rise anyway. If
the Government does not get Senate
approval for the rises in the present
form and is prevented, by any
manoeuvre, from imposing the increased
charges simply through regulation, it is
going to make them when the Budget
goes through. Under the Constitution,
the Senate cannot amend the Budget,
only reject it. And even with its present
almost obsessive drive to build up its
power vis-a-vis the House of Represen-
tatives, I do not believe the Senate
has reached such a stage of inflated
arrogance as to reject a Budget.
The former Opposition Leader
Arthur Calwell, in condemning the
action of the Labor Party in using the
Senate to reject a money Bill, told his
Labor Caucus colleagues that Labor
was becoming “Senate-happy.” A tradi-
tionalist, Calwell pointed out that Labor
was pledged to the abolition of the
Senate. Yet Labor was prepared to use
a chamber which it was pledged to
abolish to thwart the policies of a
Government which, however much
Labor regretted its election, had been
chosen by popular franchise with a
clear majority in the House of Repre-
sentatives to govern the Commonwealth.
I do not think Mr. Calwell fully
appreciated why Labor, after years of
sensibly joining with a Government of
any political hue to prevent the Senate
trespassing upon the powers of the
House of Representatives, has suddenly
switched its attitude and become, in
Mr. Calwell’s view, “Senate-happy.”
Labor’s Left Wing for many years now
has been using the Senate deliberately
to add to its powers. It can get elected
to Senate, under the almost anonymous
shelter of a Party Senate ticket, men
who would be rejected if they stood,
as individuals, for a House of Repre-
sentatives election. For example, the
President of the Left-wing Victorian
executive, Mr. W. Brown, was rejected
in the recent Victorian State elections
for what seemed the absolutely safe
seat of Coburg. But I am prepared to
bet that if Mr. Brown got the No. 1
or No. 2 position on the next Victorian
ALP Senate ticket he would be elected
to the Senate. People vote in the Senate
for a Party ticket, not for the in-
dividuals who are on it.
As it is their new stronghold, Labor’s
Left Wing sees it as in their interests to
build up the power of the Senate against
the House of Representatives, in which
the overwhelming majority of the Labor
representatives are still Right Wing.
Even among the Victorian-ALP-
executive-selected Victorian contingent
in the House of Representatives, you
will find persons with Right-wing lean-
ings.
Senator Henty, Government Leader in
the Senate
In handing out pre-selections for
House of Representatives seats even the
Victorian ALP executive has to take
into consideration whom the electors
might want. Otherwise they would
have on their hands, even in safe Labor
seats, repetitions of Mr. Brown’s rejec-
tion in Coburg.
The Left Wing are being assisted in
the moves to strengthen the Senate,
citadel of their Caucus strength, by the
fact that there are other members of
the Senate to whom Mr. Calwell’s
description of “Senate-happy” aptly
applies. I do not think the description
could be applied to the two Demo-
cratic Labor Party Senators, Vincent
Gair (Qld.) and Frank McManus
(Vic.). They are hard-headed poli-
ticians. They are merely using the
Senate, in which their strength is con-
centrated, to further the interests of
their Party. If they could establish the
same position of power in the House of
Representatives, they would use the
House and being realists would
undoubtedly be as determined as any-
one, Mr. Calwell included, to preserve
the power of the House of Representa-
tives against the Senate’s archaic chal-
lenge.
But the description could certainly
be applied to Senator Reg Wright, the
Tasmanian Liberal, who spends so
much time adorning the Opposition
benches during divisions that a sig-
nificant section of the Government’s
supporters would like to see him
“chancing his arm” electorally as an
Independent rather than running con-
tinuously at elections under the pro-
tection of the Liberal banner. Many
persons are not against the Senate
possessing reserve powers for occasional
use in the event of emergency, but
Senator Wright gives the impression
that he wants these powers not in
reserve but in active use to inflate the
importance and role of the Senate.
As I see it there are several un-
healthy factors in the present position.
The first is that if the Senate does,
as a result of the present dispute,
establish successfully its power of veto
over the House of Representatives, Gov-
ernment capacity to govern can be de-
termined by the death of a single
individual something which is both
stupid and a threat to the democratic
system, which needs continuity for its
security. As the Government Leader in
the Senate, Senator Henty pointed out
—justifiably—that the only reason the
Government was in its present plight
was because of the death of “two good,
sound, and loyal Liberal Senators.”
Senator Henty was clearly referring to
two Western Australians the late
Senator Paltridge and the late Senator
Vincent. Their deaths produced a situ-
ation under the present voting system
where the Government lost its majority
(against the general run of recent Aus-
tralian elections).
The second factor is a much more
delicate one to deal with. I do not
like criticising officials. They cannot
answer back publicly. I have rarely
criticised them in some 30 years of
political reporting.
But I think what follows has to be
said: some of the Senate officers seem
to suffer from a sense of inferiority as
far as the House of Representatives is
concerned. To maintain the status of
their chamber, some of them help indi-
vidual Senators to push what they re-
gard as the constitutionally justified
role of the Senate to extremes. There
is no doubt that some of them are
advising the Senate on what should
be the tactics for the “No” case in the
referendum seeking to break the con-
stitutional nexus between the Senate
and the House of Representatives.
As I see it, this is an intrusion into
politics and as such justifies comment.
For involved in this issue is a far
larger issue than whether postal rises
are delayed. At stake is the supremacy
of the House of Representatives as the
chamber in which the majority provides
a Government, and the issue of whether
the Government provided by the House
of Representatives is to govern or to
be thwarted by a chamber in which
even an individual death can alter sig-
nificantly and against electoral will, as
expressed in the most recent election,
the entire balance of Parliamentary
power.

AUSTRALIA
Any way you looked at it the
Bill was a blunder
A BLEARY-EYED Cabinet Minister
making his way back through the corri-
dors of Parliament House to his office
muttered to The Bulletin’s Canberra
Bureau man as he passed: “Bet you
didn’t work as late as we did last
night.”
He and his colleagues had been in
the House until seven minutes past five
that morning penance for imposing-
high telephone and postal charges on
the Australian public. Or perhaps, more
precisely, paying penance for Cabinet’s
political ineptitude.
Treasurer McMahon had the week
before persuaded the Cabinet that the
increases had to be made so why not
now? And Attorney-General Bowen
assured them all that the necessary
legislation was only a “money Bill”
and, therefore, immune from attack
in the hostile Senate.
They just didn’t think of the political
consequences; and, worse, they didn’t
know their book of rules. Section 53
of the Constitution clearly distinguishes
Bills appropriating fees for services
from general revenue or money Bills,
which the Senate cannot touch. Any-
body who had read the Clerk of the
Senate’s book on Senate Procedures
would have realised this. It was not a
“money Bill,” so it was open to attack
in the Senate.
Politically, the measure was a great
blunder, too. It was announced the
day before a N.S.W. by-election and
undoubtedly lost the Liberal Party
votes. It came two weeks before a
Referendum on having more Parlia-
mentarians, and on the heels of un-
usually intense public resentment of
Post Office mismanagement of new
sorting machinery.
As the man in the middle, Mr.
Hulme said to a crowd of 20 postal
workers and two housewives gathered
at the Canberra suburb of Curtin to
witness the opening of a new post office:
“It is not the best time to attempt
public relations stunts such as this.”
The DLP made more political
capital out of this business than the offi-
cial Labor Opposition. It led the Oppo-
sition at every stage. It announced it
would vote against the Bill in the
Senate and was able to “congratulate
the Labor Party for following our
lead.” Preoccupied as usual with inter-
PMG Hulme, man in the middle
necine squabbling, Labor was caught
out again later in the week when the
DLP announced it would move to direct
the President of the Senate to recon-
vene the Upper House should the
Government attempt to impose the new
imposts by regulation while Parliament
was in recess.
Looking to the future, the Govern-
ment will be thinking very seriously
about avoiding any repetition of such
embarrassment by following British
practice and transferring the Post
Office to a statutory authority with
responsibility to fix charges of its own
accord. The Government is quite set on
having the Post Office pay its way like
TAA, the Commonwealth Bank, the
Snowy Authority, the Commonwealth
Railways, and every other Common-
wealth business undertaking. So there
is no reason why the Post Office alone
should remain within the departmental
Public Service set-up. The great poli-
tical advantage in ending the present
arrangement would lie in eliminating
the political opprobrium of having to
make postal services pay their way.
Ironically the suggestion was made
by the Labor Party, and from his
statement at Thursday’s Press briefing,
it would appear that the Prime Minis-
ter is about to steal yet another of the
ALP’s ideas.
The ALP
Executive gambit
THE ALP’S LEFT WING indulged in
a nice psychological gambit in the
closing stages of last week’s Federal
ALP Executive meeting in Canberra.
Upon it could depend the political
future of Labor’s Senate leader, Sena-
tor Lionel Murphy.
The executive meeting was drawing
to a close. It was one at which Oppo-
sition Leader Gough Whitlam got a
continuous thrashing over the Wynd-
ham proposals for reform of Labor’s
policymaking machinery reform
which Whitlam has already stated is
essential to fit Labor for Government
in a modern Australia. With relish the
Executive knocked over every Wynd-
ham proposal of any significance. Just
to add to Whitlam’s black week the
Left-Wing-dominated Executive turned
on the N.S.W. ALP branch, probably
Whitlam’s only significant power base
in the Party.
The Executive put N.S.W. in the role
of defendant. Charges by the N.S.W.
branch of the Amalgamated Postal
Workers’ Union of N.S.W. ALP
interference in the union’s internal
affairs were 'made broadly. No really
substantial evidence was offered. Nor-
mally it would have got short shrift
and been referred back to the N.S.W.
ALP executive for report almost per-
functorily.
But the Executive “viewed the
charges with alarm.” Inexorably it
built up the atmosphere that there
could easily be Federal ALP interven-
tion in N.S.W. the type of inter-
vention that took place in the great
Labor split of 1954-55 when Federal
authorities dismissed the old executive
and appointed one of its own choosing.
Then the Executive moved on to
Senator Murphy. Powerful ALP per-
sonalities, some directly associated with
the N.S.W. ALP Executive, some in-
directly associated, have undoubtedly
been working hard to see that Senator
Murphy, if not deprived of his ALP
pre-selection for the Senate, is at least
deprived of the No. 1 or No. 2 position
on the ALP’s Senate ticket for the
forthcoming Senate elections. If any
of these contingencies happen to Sena-
tor Murphy at the College which
decides the ALP Senate ticket he is
out of the Senate. The Left Wing in
the Federal Parliamentary Caucus
helped to elect Senator Murphy to his
present position of Senate Labor


Leader. They do not want to lose
control of that position.
The Executive put the N.S.W. ALP
president, Mr. C. T. Oliver, on the
defensive —and kept him there. Oliver
knew nothing about the alleged inter-
ference in the APWU internal affairs.
He was shocked. He would have the
charges investigated. Nobody was more
willing than he to have an investigation.
As for Murphy, he thought he would
get his pre-selection all right. But the
motion which the Federal Executive
passed preserved the 1954 atmosphere
of possible Federal intervention. It
ordered N.S.W. to submit a report on
the APWU charges and the Senate pre-
selections in N.S.W. “as soon as pos-
sible.”
This was very close to the formula
used in the 1954-55 split when the ALP
Federal authorities were preparing to
march on the then N.S.W. Executive.
Then came the formal motion for
the Executive to adjourn, and the Left
Wing really turned on the psycholo-
gical screws. The next meeting of
the ALP Federal Executive would nor-
mally take place just prior to the ALP
Federal conference in Adelaide on July
31. But in the interval the ALP
Electoral College will meet on June
18 and the ticket for the forthcoming
Senate elections will be known. And
the Left Wing questioned whether there
would be need of an emergency meet-
ing between now and the date on which
the Executive would normally meet.
In other words, they conveyed to
N.S.W. that unless the Murphy business
turned out the way the ALP Federal
Executive wanted it, with Murphy get-
ting either the No. 1 or No. 2 position
on the ALP’s Senate ticket, there would
be Federal moves, including possibly a
Federal “takeover” of N.S.W.
It was a nice psychological gambit.
It will be interesting to see whether it
influences the outcome of the June 18
pre-selection ballots for positions on
the N.S.W. Labor Senate ticket.
The RSL
Privilege abused
THE INFLUENCE of the RSL in the
Federal political sphere has always been
well known and recognised, but it took
tangible shape last week when the top
brass of the RSL and Federal Parlia-
ment got together for the presentation
of two carved wooden chairs for public
use in Parliament House.
The setting was impressive it
always is in the stately vastness of
Kings Hall, Parliament House the
audience (Ministers, Members of
Parliament, secretaries, and RSL
officials) attentive, and the speakers
Prime Minister Holt, President of the
Senate Sir Alister McMullin, Acting-
Speaker of the House Mr. Lucock, and
the National President of the RSL, Sir
Arthur Lee superb. The only thing
missing were those destined to use the
seats most the public.
They were not far away 150
tourists, including 45 students of the
Smithton High School, all the way
from Tasmania to have their first look
at Parliament, waiting on and around
the front steps of Parliament House,
ignorant of the reason for the notice
placed up just before the presentation
ceremony at 2 p.m. informing “visitors”
the House would reopen for inspection
at 2.25 p.m.
But this little story of the influence
of the RSL in Federal Parliament had
an addendum in the Senate on Thurs-
day night, when the Government
Leader in the Senate, Senator Henty,
said it was true the League had pre-
sented a case to the ex-servicemen’s
committee of Federal Cabinet on May
9.
“The RSL has always enjoyed that
privilege,” he said. “It is not open to
any other body so far as I know. I do
not wish to deny the RSL that
privilege, but it is a privilege.”
The League’s submissions to the
Cabinet committee were the result of
a year’s preparation, Senator Henty
said. A motion appeared on the notice
paper, the League held a meeting in
Canberra, and a Press statement was
issued dated May 9.
The Press statement announced that
the national executive of the RSL had
resolved to press for an all-Party re-
view of the Repatriation Act to elimin-
ate a number of anomalies apparent in
recent years.
Senator Henty said the League then
had sent telegrams to individual mem-
bers of Parliament. “I believe that as
the national executive of the RSL has
the privilege of ' access to Cabinet, it
should not endeavor to pressurise by
telegram individual Senators,” he said.
“That is a privilege it should not
assume as a national body.”
Sir Arthur Lee, of the RSL
Schoolboys enter the House after the
RSL presentation
Senator Henty then revealed that as
far as he was concerned the issue had
still more serious overtones. “The
motion to set up a Select Committee on
Repatriation is a political move,”
Senator Henty said.
“It is motivated by politics, as the
Opposition hopes to use the numbers
it has gained by the death of two good
sound and loyal Liberal Senators”
(these were Senator Paltridge and
Senator Vincent, of W.A.).
The message was clear and no doubt
by now has crossed Lake Burley
Griffin to the League’s national head-
quarters.
The Vietnam war
Cost comparison
The cost of Australia’s involvement
in the Vietnam war is rising quite
rapidly, according to estimates given
by Defence Minister Fairhall. From
$73,000 in 1963 and 1964, it rose to
$1,112,000 in 1964-65 and to $3,876,000
in 1965-6. It is running this financial
year at just on seven times this amount
$27 million. Next year, with an extra
1500 troops, Canberra bombers, and the
destroyer off the coast, plus a far
greater replacement bill, the cost is
likely to double again.
But our effort is small compared
with the Americans’. Their effort, cost-
ing about $27 billion a year (a
thousand times more than ours), is a
quarter of their overall defence pro-
gram, compared with about four percent
in the case of Australia. The Americans
have approximately 2250 soldiers in
Vietnam per million of their population
compared to our 500 per million popu-
lation, and, of course, each American
has far more equipment and logistical
support than each Australian.


Apprenticeships
A feudal system
THERE ARE FEW THINGS about
Australia that can be fairly described
as feudal, but apprenticeship is one
of them.
To learn such relatively straightfor-
ward skills as laying bricks or painting
houses young men are bound to enter
into a contract to work for children’s
wages for several years while working
as laborers and getting a day a week
off to attend classes at “The Tech.”
Anyone over the age of 17 is simply
unable to acquire trade qualifications.
For years management specialists
and more enlightened employers urged
reform. After years of inaction the
Commonwealth finally came up with
a supplementary adult-training scheme
in 1964. But Mr. McMahon in his
years as Minister for Labor couldn’t
get anywhere with recalcitrant union
leaders and the new Minister, Mr. Bury,
has got no further. Now the ACTU
and the Government are attempting to
work through the Minister of Labor’s
Advisory Council.
Mr. Bury signalled another forward
urge with an interesting lecture to the
Congress on Human Relations in Mel-
bourne last week. “Technological
change must be thought of positively,
not as a threat to employment,’ he said.
“The Jeremiahs who intimately knew
the great Depression and its memories
are now in their fifties and more . . .
with progressively less influence on the
thinking of the working community.
Secured by a full-employment economy
the inhibitions and fears that led in
earlier days to restrictive and protec-
tive practices should have absolutely no
place in our attitude in the years
ahead.”
Mr. Bury said he wanted a new deal
for women workers—a vast expansion
of the range of occupations open to
them and the re-examination of legis-
lation restricting their terms and hours
of employment. He also wanted to
encourage a greater mobility of labor,
from place to place and from job to
job, but most of all he argued for
“far more” adjustments to systems of
trade and professional training.
“We cannot be content to rest until
there is a situation where semi-skilled
and unskilled persons can qualify by
training or experience to enter tech-
nician or even profession ranks regard-
less of age.” Saying that training for
trades must be opened for adults, Mr.
Bury called for a change of attitude
by State education and apprenticeship
authorities as well as by employers and
unions.
Asked by our Canberra bureau why
things were proceeding so slowly, Mr.
Bury replied: “We are operating in an
area of hide-bound conservatism and
entrenched interests of all kinds, so
you cannot expect immediate results.
Labor and National Service Minister
Bury
“You can report and exhort, per-
suade and cajole, and attempt to get
a consensus in support of this sort of
reform. Unfortunately, it takes time
and we only have limited powers in
this field. There is no other way. But
we do feel that a growing number of
people on all sides operating in this
field accept the need for change and
that we are, therefore, making pro-
gress. We should like it to be faster.”
Victoria
Mis-deal
SIR HENRY BOLTE was not
pleased. Not pleased at all. There he
was, a Premier who would deliver his
13th consecutive Budget speech in a
few months, a party leader who had
survived both private and public chal-
lenge in driving his Government on to
its greatest electoral victory only a week
before, and a prophet among the citi-
zens of his State who were about to
follow him into the bountiful era of
natural gas and oil.
But Sir Henry was not pleased last
week because, in spite of his manifest
virtues and triumphs, his Parliamentary
Party had staged a little revolt. It was
led by the men who are sometimes
known as the ’55-ers, from the year
1955 when the Liberals swept aside the
fragments of the ALP and seized office.
Most of the new men of ’55 have re-
tained their seats, but not all of them
have been able to win great favors from
their leader. By and large Sir Henry
prefers his friends to be of pre-’55
vintage, men who have known the
labors of Opposition as well as the
fruits of Government.
The backbenchers claim that the dis-
tance between themselves and Sir
Henry has lengthened over the past
couple of years, and, although they
were not able to conduct, and in most
cases did not want, a serious challenge
to the Premier’s authority, they were
determined to show some disaffection.
Their victory over the Premier came
in choosing the Speaker. It is generally
agreed that the former Minister in
charge of the difficult portfolio of
Education, Mr. Bloomfield, was asked
by Sir Henry not to stand for Cabinet
and promised the lucrative post of
Speaker. Sir Henry wanted a younger
and more able man handling Education
and was not happy with Mr. Bloom-
field for his opposition to the hanging
of Ryan.
The backbenchers, however, would
not go along with the deal and they
managed to defeat the Premier’s can-
didate and elect Mr. Vernon Christie,
’55, to the Speaker’s chair. Sir Henry
suffered an additional irritation when
his nominees, Sir William McDonald
and Mr. J. W. Manson, failed to win
Cabinet election in the ballot and were
saved only by the rule which allows
the Liberal Party leader to select the
final two members of the Cabinet.
The lesson for the Premier is that
he had better mind his temper and
spread the jobs around more widely if
he wants the next three years to slip
by happily.
One feature of the Cabinet which
could be the source of future trouble
is that there is only one Catholic, Mr.
G. O. Reid, the new Attorney-General,
and Minister for Immigration. Mr.
Reid was educated at Camberwell
Grammar and Scotch College and was
not born a Catholic.
It is also interesting to note that
all but three of the Victorian Cabinet's
15 members were educated in private
schools, at Scotch College, Geelong
Grammar, Melbourne Grammar, Gee-
long College, or smaller but not inex-
pensive grammar schools.
Volunteers Abroad
Much to gain
OVERSEAS SERVICE BUREAU
director Jim Webb fears that an “ugly
Australian” image could be fostered in
Asia if we are not wary.
The Overseas Service Bureau runs
the Volunteers Abroad scheme, which
has a number of workers placed in
Asian countries, 28 of them in Malaysia
alone.
Mr. Webb recently returned to Mel-
bourne from a regional tour in which
he discussed the Australian Volunteers
Abroad program with Government
officials in Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur,
Singapore, Jesselton, and Kuching. It
is a measure of'the increasing sophis-
tication of the idealists associated with
the volunteer scheme that Mr. Webb
declared on his return:
“Asian countries are not interested


in volunteers just because they are
volunteers. They want people with
real skills to fill gaps in existing pro-
grams of development. Critics in Asia
attack the heroic image sometimes pre-
sent in volunteer schemes run by the
West. Also there is resentment at a
dramatisation of rural problems of
developing countries. Officials do not
like foreign pressures for volunteers to
work at a ‘grass-roots’ level in rural
areas, where they may achieve little.”
Supplying agencies often see volun-
teers as agents of change. These volun-
teers are supposed to impart new and
more worthwhile attitudes among the
people with whom they work. Asians
generally regard this view as dangerous.
It is a source of great friction, particu-
larly when volunteers adopt a superior
and critical attitude toward the plans
of the receiving country.
Mr. Webb said that of the countries
he had just visited, Thailand, Malaysia,
and Singapore are all very interested in
obtaining the services of volunteers with
relevant skills and realistic views about
their worth to the host country. “These
Governments recognise that a period of
volunteer service is actually of consider-
able value personally to the participant
and to the sending country. They know
that volunteers have probably as much
to gain as they have to contribute in a
short term overseas.”
The Overseas Service Bureau, with
124 volunteers serving in 11 countries,
is anxious to explain to intending volun-
teers that they should look forward to
their period of service in this light. The
Bureau does not encourage volunteers
who would be likely to leave for foreign
shores with any modern variant of the
“white man’s burden” in their knap-
sacks.
Actors' Equity
Policing agents
ACTORS’ EQUITY JOINED the
casual musicians’ dispute with Sydney
and Melbourne television channels last
week in a role which projected the
image it prefers —one of Robin Hood
helping to protect the weak against the
strong. That followed closely on another
engagement in which the image got a
little distorted in the processing and
ended with Equity bearing a surprising
resemblance to the Sheriff of Notting-
ham.
The issue began as a straight goodie-
baddie affair, Equity v. Agents, with the
right, apparently, on Equity’s side. In
1956 only six variety agents were
licensed by the N.S.W. Department of
Labor and Industry under the Industrial
Arbitration Act, which permits a
theatrical agent to take no more than
10 percent of the artist’s fee. In the
following 10 years, with the rapid
growth of entertainment in licensed
clubs in N.S.W., the demands of tele-
vision in all States, and the big-money
pop concert tours, agents were not only
necessary in the business side of show-
biz but eventually became status sym-
bols. No one was anyone unless he or
she could speak of “my agent.”
All that the law requires of an agent
is that he or she be licensed, have an
office and no police record, and pay a
$4 licence fee. By November last year
86 licenses had been issued. Equity
suspected that a “get-rich-quick racket”
was in rapid growth and began an
investigation. It showed startling anoma-
lies, such as that some teenage pop
groups had been paying their agents 30
percent commission for every booking.
Tricks, and even extortion from fame-
hungry youngsters were alleged.
Equity instantly put a number of
agents out of business by issuing a new
list of conditions for gaining Equity
approval. Agents had to have a properly
fitted office and waiting-room, make
engagements for an artist which totalled
at least $2BOO a month in artists’ fees,
and never act as a manager as well.
“This last condition takes away the
right of a mother to act as her daugh-
ter’s manager—it’s ridiculous,” said one
agent still on the approved list. He said
Equity had been issuing “approved”
lists for some time. List No. 2 con-
tained 58 agents’ names, list number 3
had 46, and list number 4 —compiled
this month—contained about 30 names.
“All ‘small’ agents are ruined—for
instance, the musician agent who has
one act he manages is now out of busi-
ness because he can’t meet the $2BOO
monthly stipulation,” said the agent.
Equity has warned clubs that to
accept a booking from any agent whose
Australia’s increasing relations with the world can be measured in many ways.
One is the growing flow of important visitors. For example, Canberra was visited
last week by three Singapore Parliamentarians, three leading Indonesian newspaper
editors, and two Thai journalists. John McCloy (left), a special assistant to five
U.S. Presidents, was also there, greeted by Ambassador Ed Clark (right). He
arrived just as U.S. Under-Secretary of Defence Henry Kuss was leaving, and
remarked: “Oh, was Henry here? I didn’t know that.”
name does not appear on the approved
list will be courting trouble.
Even those who are included in
Equity’s list of 30 “approved” agents
think there’s something paradoxical in
the union’s adoption of a police role,
which seems based on the theory that
“you have to be big to be good.”
South Australia
The TAB age
In South Australia TAB betting is
just over a month'old, and the astonish-
ing thing is not that it’s working so well
but that it is doing so without a mur-
mur of protest from any quarter.
The only social criticism of TAB in
S.A. comes in a comparatively mild
request from the United Churches’
Social Reform Board that the Govern-
ment do something to stop children
from going into TAB agencies, even
with their parents.
It is too early to assess the effect of
TAB on S.A.’s SP betting. The first
surprising discovery is that it hasn’t so
far affected attendances at Adelaide’s
metropolitan courses. Certainly there
has not been anything like the 12 per-
cent drop that the race clubs, going on
interstate experience, were prepared for.
On the operations side, the most
serious complaint to date was that the
agencies weren’t staying open long
enough to give people a chance to col-
lect their winnings. That has now been
corrected.

Newspapers
"Sun"-beams
THERE’S A LITTLE bit of Sydney’s
“Sun” shining on Hong Kong. The
British colony is having a newspaper
war, one that is showing signs of
becoming a knock-down-drag-out affair
of the type staged in Sydney in recent
years by the afternoon terrors, the
“Sun” and the “Mirror.”
In Hong Kong’s war the' protagonists
are the two-year-old tabloid the
“Star” and the 122-year-old broadsheet
“China Mail” (founded 1848), which
is planning to go tabloid. In both
papers former Sydney “Sun” men are
filling the key posts of news editor
Alfred Lee on the “Star” and Jack
Spackman on the “Mail.”
Lee, an Australian-born Chinese, is
well remembered among Australian
journalists for such flights-of-reporting-
fancy as the Tasmanian Monster affair
and the Skripov interview when he was
the only reporter in a plane-load be-
tween Sydney and Darwin to get a
quote from the expelled Russian. Lee
has been in Hong Kong more than a
year, compared with Spackman’s two
or three months, and, therefore, has
a better knowledge of the local scene.
But non-news is non-news in Hong
Kong just as in Sydney.
The “Mail,” eagerly looking to T
(for tabloid) Day on June 1, has
dropped Vietnam and Indonesia (two
old regulars) as Page One lead material.
In their place have come a kidnapping
and a police chase, complete with gun-
fire and drama and women’s screams
in the best traditions of Sydney after-
noon journalism. The “Star” is fighting
back. Last week, alongside a particularly
vivid Page Three picture of a lady in
a G-string, ran the non-news story of
the year “Striptease for Hong Kong?
Never, says Licensing Inspector . . .”
The “Mail” has declared itself in
favor of a greyhound racing venture for
Hong Kong (the only newspaper in
the colony to do so) and this has
provided some good opportunities for
Spackman to use his “Sun”-acquired
skills. While the editorial columns have
supported the dog move, the reporters
have managed to dig up a series of
stories that all throw favorable light on
the proposal. A good old Sydney “Sun”
trick this one.
But the “Mail” really showed its new-
found class when it got the magic
word SHOCK on to a poster. The
story? Nothing less than that highly
significant newsbreak, the Elvis Presley
marriage.
. The readership they are fighting for
ts not all that big. Present estimates of
circulation are 16,000 for the “Star”
and 8000 for the “Mail.” But most of
the advertising revenue in Hong Kong
is spent on the small proportion of the
Population that has most of the money,
and most of them speak and read
nglish. The pickings, indeed, are
worth while.


Personality
Vic Richardson
THE VIC RICHARDSON Memorial
Gates, which open the way to the
Outer at Adelaide Oval, are in posi-
tion, but will not be officially opened
until next summer. It is to be a
cricketing occasion, not a football one,
though Vic was as good a footballer
as he was a cricketer. The gates carry
two bronze plaques by Adelaide sculp-
tor John Dowie. One is Australian foot-
ball and the other cricket, in which
the batsman is recognisably Vic
Richardson.
Other grounds have their memorial
gates to the famous. There are the
Grace Gates at Lord’s, the Sir Jack
Hobbs Gates at the Oval, the James
E. White Gates at Taunton, and the
Tate Gates at Hove. But as Sir Donald
Bradman has pointed out, the Vic
Richardson Gates are the first to be
erected as Outer ones. Bradman thinks
this is as it ought to be because Vic
has always been “a man of the people.”
He was marvellously liked. He was
goodlooking, he loved every game he
played and he had nerve and style.
He was the best all-round sportsman
South Australia has produced.
Cricketer, footballer, baseballer, athlete,
lacrosse player. In 1925, even before
he had captained a Test side, he was
voted Australian athlete of the year.
He’s 73 now and, because of his
broadcasting, still one of the best-
known personalities in Australian
sport. He is one of the deities of the
Adelaide Oval, the scene of so many
of his triumphs. From the broadcast
box he watches and criticises his
grandsons, the cricketing Chappells,
making their mark. Outside he has a
street which the City Council has
named for him Vic Richardson
Road. That should be worth a further
note in Wisden.
The beaches
Broken bottles
FROM AROUND AUSTRALIA in
recent months have come cries of “Ban
the Bottle” not from apostles of pro-
hibition but from municipal councils
worried about the advent of the ten-
ounce, 10c throwaway soft-drink bottle.
By 1970, manufacturers promise that ten
percent of Australian soft-drink pro-
duction will be in throwaway bottles,
20 percent in cans, and 70 percent in
the old-fashioned returnable bottle.
The Vic Richardson Gates
That will mean about 160 million
throwaway bottles in 1970.
In Victoria, a big battle seems to be
looming between the glass manufac-
turers and the councils, whose ranks
have now been joined by the Victorian
Bottle Merchants’ Association and the
Retail Confectioners and Mixed Busi-
nesses Association.
The bottle merchants say they will
not handle throwaway bottles, and have
sent a letter to every council in Victoria
seeking action against them. The rea-
son for their concern: some 20 million
dozen deposit soft-drink bottles are
collected every year for reuse by
bottlers. The throwaways represent a
substantial reduction in turnover.
The cafe and mixed business owners
have received a directive from their
Association not to handle the bottles,
and are heeding it. The Association
considers the new bottles a hazard to
the public and an economic imposition.
Australian Consolidated Industries,
which manufactures most of the throw-
away bottles used, naturally thinks the
problem is “vastly overrated.” Mr. B.
Gerathy, Officer in Charge of Broken
Glass for 36 years with ACI, said:
“There is very little broken glass around
the beaches. I walked from Manly
beach to Queenscliff in the middle of
summer and counted only ten bottles
on the beach.” But a beach inspector
on one of Sydney’s northern beaches
snorted when he heard this. “They’re
everywhere,” he said. “Dim risrht into
the sand, in the water, round ill. ">cks.”
N.S.W. shopkeepers don’t have too
much of a problem in disposing of the
bottles—ACl delivers huge drums to
milk bars throughout the State and
pays Boy Scouts and charity organisa-
tions to collect the bottles.
The main advantage of the throw-
away bottle to manufacturers is the
cut in labor costs. The returnable
bottle costs three times as much in
overheads. “It’s the only way to com-
pete with cans in the important field
of chainstores and supermarkets,” said
Mr. Gerathy.
Adelaide offers reassurance. At the
beginning of last summer when the
“stubbies” appeared there, seaside
councils warned that kiosk and res-
taurant owners might lose their licences
if they stocked the bottles. In the first
spasm of alarm, councils wrote to local
government bodies in the U.K., Europe
and U.S.A. Almost uniformly the
replies were that the dangers were
overrated mainly because shop,
keepers were reluctant to handle them.
With the summer over, Adelaide coun-
cils are less alarmed. The shopkeepers
had heeded their warnings, and there
was no increase in broken glass on the
beaches.
Seafood
Dollar catch
AUSTRALIA’S traditional deep-sea
fishing and prawning grounds have been
mostly south of Capricorn, but lately
bigger fishing companies, including two
international ones, have been extending
northwards along the east coast
toward the Gulf of Carpentaria and
in the west as far as Dampier. Eventu-
ally the operations are expected to link
up somewhere off Arnhem Land.
Much of the catch, so far, is in
tropical “banana” prawns (similar in
size to king prawns), but few of these
will reach Australian tables. The idea
is to process them at sea for export.
Fisheries men predict eventual year-
round operations, with tuna as the
alternative catch. Australia’s declaration
of a 12-mile limit within which Jap-
anese and Russian boats can’t compete
has made the development possible.
In Western Australia, the interna-
tionals Vestey’s Planet and Ross Inter-
national, together with Michael Kailis’
Gulf Fisheries, have been fishing for
king and tiger prawns the past few
seasons in Shark Bay and Exmouth
Gulf, but now the boats are moving
farther north around the Hamersley
iron port of Dampier, moving to the
more prolific but less dependable
banana prawns.
The pioneering technique has been
for the research boats and spotting
aircraft to go out first, followed by
small groups of fishermen to test the
new grounds. Some of the hauls have
been so big that the processors could
not keep pace and all the catch has
had to be tossed back. Larger process-
ing ships can’t be used without further
research because the variety is so incon-
sistent between 1962 and 1965 in
Exmouth Gulf it dropped from 50 per-
cent to nil, and where did they go?
But even as it is, the West’s prawning
industry has already proved a good
new dollar earner with a total catch
worth $2 million last year, expected to
go 70 percent higher this season,
gradually overtaking the W.A. cray-
fishing industry in export earnings.

COMMENT
When Aborigines become people
AS PREPARATIONS go on for the
May 27 referendum, with its proposal
that Aborigines be considered as people,
we looked through last week’s news-
papers and found this:
In Bega, in southern N.S.W., the
municipal council complained that it
had not been consulted when the State’s
Aboriginal Welfare Board bought
some land from the Church of Eng-
land and planned to build 14 houses
for Aborigines. The Council con-
sidered that Aborigines should be
educated to cope with the sudden
transition to “the best sub-division in
Bega” and the mayor announced that
there were no permanent jobs for
Aborigines in Bega.
In South Australia, to those who
complained that Aborigines drink too
much, the chairman of the Aboriginal
Affairs Board said: “We feel that
Aborigines are entitled to equality in
our community and should have the
same rights as ourselves, whether they
abuse them or not. They do not pre-
sent the problem of white teenagers.”
In the West, the little town of Pin-
gelly made news when local magis-
trates suggested birching or caning
troublesome blacks. At the same time
the “West Australian” criticised the
Commonwealth for being without a
policy, saying: “It is a pity that this
issue was not worked out in advance
by the State and the Commonwealth
so that the people could have been
presented with a firm, rational policy.”
It was a mixed bag of reactions,
reflecting the slowly changing attitude
of a community that has ceased to wage
its long guerilla war against the
Aborigines, but is not sure what to do
next. The “West Australian” is wrong
when it suggests that the Government
should go to the people with a policy
for Aborigines. The Commonwealth
is asking for an extension of its powers,
not for an endorsement of a particular
policy. But it is right when it says
that there should be a policy, although
the time for it is after the referendum.
What kind of a policy is it to be?
In general terms and on paper we
already have a national policy on
Aborigines, agreed to by the six States
and by the Commonwealth. As first
defined it was a policy of full assimila-
tion; when redefined, it became a
policy of assimilation on option, thereby
allowing those Aborigines who did not
want to fully join the European com-
munity to have the chance of not
doing so. But expressions of policy
of this kind, however admirable in
themselves as a general guide to action,
have the disadvantage of cloaking
failure to act with the generous verbiage
of good intention.
What the Commonwealth should
concern itself with first is money. If
Aborigines are to be treated as belong-
ing to the human race, special financial
provisions are needed to make up for
their recent arrival in that category.
There should be increased spending
on all kinds of services and amenities
so that the option of assimilation has
practical meaning. And then the Com-
monwealth should apply pressure.
Ministers should make speeches of
strong imaginative appeal, rallying sup-
port and crystallising opinion. We
have been too tight-fisted in handling
the special problems of the Aborigines,
but, even more important, we have
been too tight-minded.




THE OUT-SPORTS
BILLY WHITE WOLF, part Red
Indian, 17 stone, Master of Education,
is fighting Pierre (“The Beast”) La
Belle, Canadian, shaved head, educa-
tional qualifications unknown. Left wrist
to left wrist, they are locked to each
other by five feet of chain. They growl,
moan, spit, grimace. White Wolf, the
hero, suffers for a while under the
vicious attacks of The Beast. He rallies
a little, gets pounded by The Beast,
and almost expires. The Beast raises the
chain menacingly. The audience yells.
The chain scrapes over White Wolf’s
face and the blood streams down.
“More,” the audience screaftis. “Do
it to him. Blood, blood, blood.” White
Wolf stops suffering. He cuts The
Beast’s face with his chain. More blood.
An old man on crutches in the audience
waves one of his crutches at The Beast.
Policemen, smiling incredulously,
quickly move forward. A woman in a
ringside seat clutches her little girl’s
arm. The child looks glassy-eyed. White
Wolf wraps the chain around The
Beast’s neck and wins. He is carried by
his fairs to his dressing-room. His
bearers touch his blood and smell it
to see if it’s real. A man of 50 emerges
mto the fresh air of the street with the
smiling face of one who has seen the
light. “That’s what I like to see,” he
says. “A bit of blood a real good
mash-up.”
Wrestling is one of the out-sports,
the sports that Australians watch or
play but that you don’t read about in
the newspapers or even hear about
unless you are a fan. Yet wrestlers per-
form to full houses in most capital
cities every week, audiences with a sur-
prising number of children. It is one of
the most popular audience-participation
sports we have. Television wrestling
matches can attract 70 percent of people
watching television at the time they
are shown. The wrestlers are imported
and paid at least $5OO a week, working
a three- to six-month season, in per-
formances which audiences pay up to
$2 to see.
It is stretching words to call this
kind of wrestling a “sport” at all. What
it does provide is an unashamed grati-
fication of the lust for the enactments
of savagery that may also be part of
the appeal of some of the more polite
games. It is as much sport as a good
thriller, with equally improbable plots.
Similarly placed in the out-sports as a
gladiator substitute is the Roller Game,
now packing the hippodromes with its
mixture of toughness, histrionics,
savagery, and skill. Old narrative
themes are re-enacted when a bashing,
slashing, cursing team of 15 men or
women circle a hardboard track, im-
posing a blockade on the 15 equally
bashing, slashing members of the
opposing team.
Like the revival in wrestling, a
market for the Roller Game was first
created by television; then audiences
wanted to see their drama live. Two
American teams flew in for a season.
Now we are developing local talent. An
hour’s roller-game performance has got
much more bite to it than an old-style
cowboys and Indians film, as both
sexes, the women with their hair gaily
painted, thrash each other for an hour
in continuing battle.
The pleasures of the Roman circus
come in even rawer form in cockfight-
ing. A small and secretive group are
so infatuated with the thrill of watching
cocks tear each other to death with
two-inch steel spurs that they will
travel interstate to watch a good match
in one of the bushland locations out-
side the big cities, laying bets of up
to $lOO. Between matches cockfighting
fanciers can relax by reading the Ameri-
can magazine “Feathered Warrior,”
which keeps them in touch with world
trends in their chosen sport. There is
a reward of $5OO for information about
cockfights, but the information does not
come in.
At the other end of the spectrum of
the out-sports are those who get their
thrills by risking their own necks. Of
these, the most melodramatic are the
skydivers. We talked to Mr. Ken Bath,
an instructor at the Pacific School of
Parachuting in N.S.W., about 21-year-
old Jennifer Ann Douglas, who died


in March on her first parachute jump
with Bendigo’s Golden City Skydivers.
“She was the fourth in seven years
that’s not too bad,” Mr. Bath said. He
was anxious to point out that all the
deaths had been caused by human
error, not equipment failure.
The Pacific Club has training once
a month, training 72 people a year for
$32 each, including equipment and in-
surance on the parachute. (Personal
insurance is a private matter, and in-
surance companies would find a con-
fessed skydiver a bad risk.) It takes
two weekends to train a novice up to
the first jump. Seasoned jumpers can
then join the Sky Divers’ Club, a re-
doubtable group of 30. “It’s the only
sport worth doing,” Mr. Bath said.
“There are a thousand parachutists
floating alone in the Australian skies
every weekend . . . there’s nothing like
the feeling you get when you float in
the sky.”
The leather-jacketed motor-cyclists
Cricko is cricket warmed up—for women only
also put their own lives in the balance.
“I’m afraid of growing old,” said one
young taxi-driver who races at a cinder
track once a week. This seems a well-
worn James Dean complex, but is
apparently shared by the young and
not-so-young motor-cyclists. The sec-
retary of the Auto Cycle Union said,
“There are 63,000 miles between acci-
dents and only one in 14 is serious.”
The Auto Cycle clubs concentrate
more on skill than speed, he said. The
clubs meet every Sunday on a short-
circuit track with one left-hand and
one right-hand corner. Drivers must
brake to get round safely. The 1300-odd
active riders in the Union have one
thing in common an interest in
mechanics. Doctors, insurance salesmen,
clerks, they compete for silver cups and
a few dollars in prizemoney.
The new, light Japanese cycles have
created new enthusiasm for the sport.
Cyclists can pay anything from $2OO
to $lOOO for their bikes, and outfit
themselves in regulation leather jacket
and trousers, crash helmet and goggles
for about $5O.
Even floating on a kite is better than
nothing. This is the sport of the 500
members of the Kiteflyers’ Club, who
water-ski with a kite or skyplane
strapped to their backs. They take off
when the boat towing them reaches
about 35 mph, shoot 100 to 400 feet
above it, let go of the rope, and float,
gently down unless the kite flips
over and comes down with a force that
could kill, a risk kiteflyers are prepared
to take.
Many kiteflyers are also barefoot
skiers. The 700 members of the Barefoot
Water Skiers’ Club are now attempting
to run a world barefoot water-skiers’
contest, but although an American holds
the world record of one hour 19
minutes American enthusiasts cannot
muster the numbers to contest with the
Australians. Barefoot skiers who become
bored with straightforward barefoot ski-
ing try new tricks skiing barefoot
backward, or on one foot.
Another group of out-sports, while
not necessarily involving risk, consist
of doing things in a difficult way when
they could be done more easily with
modern equipment. The most notable
of these is the Australian Bowhunters’
Association, whose 60 members stalk
game not with rifles but with bows and
arrows. To make it even harder,
members make their own arrowheads.
(With three or four barbs and a sharp
cutting edge, these can take off a pig’s
leg with a direct hit.) Members like to
get well away from the cities for their
serious hunting, going as far as the
Atherton Tableland to hunt kangaroo,
or Darwin to hunt buffalo.
“Bowhunters give the animal a more
sporting chance,” said Mrs. G. F. Scott,
wife of one of the club’s members.
“It’s a real sport. Bowhunters will never
leave game to die in agony as riflemen
do. Our men will huht a pig for perhaps
seven miles, but they will kill him in
the end.”
Man’s (and woman’s) ingrained
desire to hit something with something
else is also expressed without killing.
Gun clubs are common enough, but
there are also 5000 registered pistol club
members in Australia, and about 2000
of them are women. In the “house and
garden” charm of St. Ives, Sydney, 30
or 40 pistol-shooters meet every week-
end at their bushland range, many of
them mothers with small children. They
settle down for the afternoon in their
cubicle with a set of earplugs, shoot-
ing case, telescope, and other para-
phernalia (equipment can cost up to
$600), and shoot at a still or moving
target 25 to 50 metres away.
On the afternoon we visited a shoot
an elderly lady with a brand-new Ham-
mersley free-loading pistol ($250) took
some minutes to get herself into the
professional stance, free hand on hip,
pistol raised to shoulder level, then
Hurling is the most rugged of all team games
knocked her knitting off the shelf in
front of her. It was as if someone had
dropped a prayer book.
But the largest group of out-sports
are not “out” because of any suspicion
of bloodlust or illegality. They are the
gentle addictions which merely arouse
in the outsider a feeling of puzzlement
Why choose cricko for your leisure
hours? What is the pleasure of a wet
ride down a river in a canoe? What is
sphairee?
Many of the 2000 archers in Aus-
tralia dress up in jerkins and feathered
berets to compete in tournaments with
evocative names like The York, The
County of Cumberland, and the Freddy
Herbert. Men use a 30 to 351 b. bow,
women a 271 b. one. You can pay from
$4O to $lOO for a bow, and $2O for a set
of eight shafts, which are made of a
light metal called duralium. The bows
come in plastic, the strings in dacron.
To correct range there are sights, wind
gauges, spirit levels, and built-in stag-


Users and vanes. “Archery,” says Sydney
archer Les Pratt, “holds more of a chal-
lenge than shooting a gun.”
In the 15th century, archers returning
from tournaments would throw their
arrows by hand at a target on the wall.
In clubs and pubs all over Australia
they are still at "it. The tournaments
may have shrunk to a row with the
boss, but darts is still the working man’s
game. “These games are not played with
one hand round a pint and one eye on
the board,” said a sports organiser for
R.SL clubs. “We have interstate cham-
pionships which are very important and
the boys take the game very seriously.”
The element of fantasy which plays
such an important part in out-sports
(as it does in in-sports) can also express
itself in newly invented games. In 1961
Mr. Frank Beck invented “sphairee.”
Because Mr. Beck is a student of Greek
he named his new sport after the Greek
word for ball. His game, which is played
on a concrete or wooden court 30 feet
Cave explorers see themselves as individualists
by 13 feet with a plastic perforated ball
•and wooden bats, is a kind of instant
tennis. “I wanted to think of some way
of abbreviating tennis,” Mr. Beck
explained.
Similarly, the game of cricko is a
kind of accelerated cricket. Played only
by women, this game demands a 20-yard
pitch and two creases a batting
crease and a compulsory aim crease.
If the ball crosses the compulsory aim
crease you have to hit it ready or not.
The balls are made of hard rubber and
throwing is allowed. The game seems
too strenuous for men. Only women
belong to the Cricko Club of N.S.W.
and Queensland.
We need some new blood,” Miss
P| U , e Graham, secretary of the Cricko
Llub, said. “A year or so ago we played
a team of English officers from a
visiting ship and we beat them hollow.
hey were very upset and wanted a
return game, but the ship sailed.”
Another gentle addiction is croquet,
w «h a dozen clubs in both New South
Wales and Victoria and a scattering
in the other States. Some 3000 people,
mainly women, and mainly between
40 and 80, spend a lot of time knocking
balls through hoops. Enthusiasts say
crocquet calls for the application of
chess and the skill of billiards. They
may be right. The balls clear the hoop
with less than the width of a penny to
spare and you must knock two balls
through the six hoops several times
before the game is over.
There are an estimated 2000 speleolo-
gists in this country. Harley Wright,
secretary of the University of Sydney
Speleological Society, says cave-lovers
are individualists who dislike organised
sport. “It is a mixture of science and
sport,” he said. “Some speleologists are
interested in cave fauna, some are inter-
ested in exploration; I do it for fun.”
On weekend trips speleologists take
six hours to feel their way through a
cave. Sometimes they find pockets of
foul air, fatal if you linger too long,
and they carry with them about 100
feet of wire ladder rolled up in a ball,
carbide lights, and ropes.
Pigeon-fanciers are a quiet breed of
men who spend their weekends tossing
80 or more homing pigeons into the
air, then sitting around waiting for them
to come home. Members of some of the
3000 clubs dotted all over Australia
take part in a series of races which go
on from June to October.
Each owner bands his birds and starts
training the young ones by letting them
out ten or 20 miles from home, then
increasing the distance to 700 miles, a
two-day flight. Most breeders keep
about 20 birds, each worth about $lO,
caged. Racing birds live in lofts. The
birds are sent to the starting-point,
which may be interstate, by trailer and
then are let loose to fly home. The
breeder whose bird clocks the best time
back wins only a few dollars, but “it’s
a real thrill to see them folding their
wings and sliding down to you,” Mr.
F. Shepherd, secretary of the Federa-
tion of Pigeon Racers, said.
“The birds weigh only 13 ounces, but
they can fly a mile a minute if the wind
is right,” he said. “No one knows how
their homing instinct works. That’s
part of the fascination of the game.”
The pigeons are beautifully colored,
pink, blue, and some speckled or white.
They eat a matchbox full of wheat,
pigeon peas, Milo, and corn each day
and live 30 to a loft.
A not-so-gentle addiction is hurling,
probably the most rugged team-game
played anywhere. Sometimes called
armed hockey, hurling has 15 players
to a side and similar rules to hockey.
The sticks are slightly broader at the
base than hockey sticks and can be used
Barefoot skiing is catching on fast
as anything from a tennis racquet to a
golf stick. Hurling players quickly learn
to duck.
Hurling is the national game of Ire-
land and is followed with passion here
by some 30,000 Irish-born residents and
some initiated Australians. There are
six teams in Victoria and three in both
New South Wales and South Australia.
A few Australians have tried to join the
teams but without success. “It has to
be born in you,” said Mr. Tom Kelly,
president of the Gaelic Athletic Asso-
ciation.
Dedication is the one thing the out-
sporters have in common. For instance,
we have in our midst some canoeists
who keep in constant touch with their
local water board so that they will know
when some water is being released from
a dam. When the water comes down
there they are, trying to make some
headway up a river against a strong
current.




ARE WE
WHITE ASIANS?
TEN YEARS AGO the average Aus-
tralian (including the present Australian
Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt) re-
garded himself for all practical pur-
poses as a transplanted European. In-
creasingly, the average Australian (and
Mr. Holt is certainly included in this
category) is nowadays prone to regard
himself as an Asian of European
extraction.
The recent visit of Holt to Cam-
bodia, Laos, Taiwan, and South Korea
undoubtedly brought this out. Holt’s
approach throughout was not that of a
European leader intruding into Asian
affairs but of an Asian leader dealing
with neighbors—fellow Asian leaders.
And not the least interesting aspect of
the Holt tour is that the Asian leaders
he saw —Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia,
Prince Souvanna Phouma of Laos,
Prime Minister Yen of Taiwan, and
Prime Minister Chung of South Korea
—seemed prepared to accept him as
exactly that. In fact, Prince Sihanouk
made the point precisely. Americans
were intruders upon the Asian scene,
was the effect of Sihanouk’s words.
Even though they followed a policy
different from Cambodia, one closely
akin to the U.S. policy and one with
which Cambodia disagreed, Australia
nevertheless had a right to take up
attitudes in the South-East Asian region.
It belonged there.
Possibly, these Asian leaders were
merely practising Asian courtesy toward
a guest. But my impression was that
they were not. At any rate, their atti-
tudes. were consistently reflected by
officials who did not have the same
reason to exercise the same courtesy
toward the Australian party (including
the Press). They seemed to accept the
fact that as a nation which—though of
European extraction and culture —was
nevertheless located on the periphery
of the South-East Asian area, even if
not precisely within it, Australians had
a right to participate in Asian affairs
and to hold viewpoints on Asian affairs
without becoming liable to the charge of
being external intruders. This pro-
pensity on the part of Australians to
regard themselves as, if not Asians of
European culture, at least people who
must of necessity have close links,
understanding, and sympathy with
the problems of their neighbors is nowa-
days undoubtedly intensifying, and
Holt’s tour (and the publicity which
accompanied it) will contribute to a
further intensification.
My impression is that the trip did
not change Holt’s basic views. He still
believes in the necessity of the United
States’ presence and that, but for this
presence, there would be no opportunity
of survival for the developing non-
Communist Asia which he is firmly
convinced he saw- emerging behind the
American screen. But the trip did pro-
duce either changes in approach or at
least confirmation of views some
opposed to those of the United States
which previously he had held only
tentatively. Cambodia was the best
example of this. Holt has always been
vaguely suspicious of the United
States’ analysis of Cambodian policy
and its allegedly pro-Communist lean-
ing. He has always felt that there was
a definite advantage to those involved
in assisting South Vietnam (including
Australia) in limiting the area of actual
A report written

conflict and that Sihanouk was not
a crypto-Communist but a nationalist
intent upon preserving the integrity of
his country and his people from the
horrors of war. Holt went and saw
for himself, and he arrived at the con-
clusion that his tentative opinions were
correct. Even though it antagonised
some U.S. opinion (and it did), he said
what he believed firmly, crisply,
and to the point.
There were also important changes
in policy emphasis. Australian news-
papers were inclined to dismiss Holt’s
report on his trip as a travelogue. But
it was far more significant than that.
It was a revision of attitudes. In the
past, Australians have tended to regard
the giving of aid to underdeveloped
countries as something that Australia
gave in self-interest, as a necessary
means of winning a point in the Cold
War. Said Holt: “We see the raising
of Asian living standards as a desirable
end in itself, not simply as a desirable
means of making gains in the Cold
War.”
The Australian attitude has always
been rather ambiguous on neutralist or
non-aligned countries. Holt said: “Our
relationships with other countries are
not determined solely on the basis of
whether they are allied with us. We
accept diversity. In our search for a
stable, secure Asian region, growing in
economic prosperity, we promote the
closest relations with Asian allies in col-
lective defence organisations. But we
also seek to promote the best possible
relations with countries which have
chosen the path of neutrality. We sup-
port and seek to uphold the national
integrity of all countries in the region.
And beyond this we look to a future
settlement with mainland China, with-
out which there can be no lasting peace
in Asia.” This for the first time that
I am aware of put the Australian
line on its attitude toward non-aligned
countries firmly on the record, and
with its reference to mainland China
is a tribute to the influence that
Sihanouk (in Holt’s view he is a nation-
alist with frontiers which Sihanouk him-
self described to Holt as indefensible)
had upon Holt’s thinking.
There has always been a fear in
Australia, unexpressed but real, of the
social revolution in Asia. Australians,
products of a society which has a high
degree of stability, both politically and
economically, are prone to distrust
dramatic social or political movement.
But Holt during his Asian trip saw the
immensity of the problems that his
Asian counterparts were confronting.
He was impressed by the largeness of
the problems in the same way as he
was impressed by the way in which they
were tackling them. He could see that
for them there was no easy road, as
there is in a long-established and pros-
perous parliamentary democracy for
people like himself. So he stated an
attitude toward social revolution m
Asia that is quite a change from the
one previously held. He said: “We are
not opposed to the social revolution
which has been taking place and is
continuing in South-East Asia. This
social revolution reflects long-suppressed
yearnings for national identity, social
betterment, and economic progress. n e
seek these things for ourselves. What
we are opposed to, is the perversion of
the forces of social revolution in Asia
to establish through indirect pressure,
through subversion, through insurgency,
through terrorism, and aggression, Com-
munist regimes which are neither
sought nor wanted by the majority of
the people in the country concerned.”
As far as I could judge (and I
accompanied him throughout), Holt
was quite a good Australian emissary
to send into Asia. The Asians appar-
ently find a discernible difference be-
tween the, European and the Austra-
lian, despite the Australian’s European
extraction. The fact that Australia is
a small country, with a population of
only 12 million and clearly has no
territorial ambitions and never has had,
while the Europeans belong to nations
that once had such ambitions, probably
helps. Australia not only wants a stable
and prosperous Asia, but indeed must
Prime Minister Holt’s recent Asian journey emphasised our egalitarianism
have one if it is to survive and to
continue the development that has
brought it the highest living standard
in the area.
I have a theory that there is another
factor which operates in Australia’s
favor. Generally, Europeans do not do
manual work in the tropics. They leave
such work, particularly if it is unskilled,
to the indigenes. But whether it is in
the tropics or in the more temperate
section of their continent, Australians
do manual work, both skilled and un-
skilled. This gives them the completely
egalitarian aproach to the Asians who
do the unskilled work in their countries
an egalitarianism which Asians con-
stantly comment upon and which ap-
pears to surprise them. When Tun
Abdul Razak, Deputy Prime Minister
°f Malaysia, visited Australia recently
he said the memory that always stayed
in his mind was of Australian soldiers
back in the rickshaw days getting be-
tween the shafts of the rickshaws while
the rickshaw operators (Tun Razak
said they looked “shocked”) lounged
back in the passengers’ seat. The tone
of voice in which Tun Razak told this
suggested he was convinced that no
one else but Australians would do this.
Holt has some of this egalitarianism
which, when expressed unaggressively,
appears attractive to Asians. He has no
sense of superiority, even when he is
entitled to feel superior. He is genuinely
humanitarian. Poverty distresses him. So
does family and national hardship when
translated into the terms of distress for
individuals.
He confessed quite openly that he
felt quite humble alongside some of the
Asian leaders. What constantly im-
pressed him was the quality of many
of the Asians who are trying to guide
and direct their people into a better
way of life. For him, by comparison,
the problems were comparatively
simple, and this brought out in him a
sympathy for those whose problems
were larger, more complex, and less
easily handled. He also in his own
words “tried to project an Australian
attitude of fairness and friendliness and
the knowledge that the views we put we
hold to grimly.”
He was sometimes almost embar-
rassingly honest in his reply to ques-
tions. In Taiwan, where he was warned
that the leaders were sensitive about
both Australia’s recognition of Outer
Mongolia and any suggestion of recog-
nition of mainland China, he was ques-
tioned about Australia’s reason for
recognising Outer Mongolia. An experi-
enced and able politician, Holt could
have easily evaded any reference to
mainland China. Instead, with complete
honesty, he threw in a reference, so as
to make clear to his hosts that, while
he recognised Taiwan’s interests and
would do everything he could to sup-
port them, his views on mainland China
did not coincide with those of Taiwan’s
leaders. He said: “It may seem strange
to some people that one announces a
decision like the recognition of Outer
Mongolia which is not likely to be
popular in the host country just before
you visit that country. I think you must
understand something of the Australian
character to understand why we acted
as we did. I would not like to have
come to this country, have said nothing
about this matter, and then, having
enjoyed your hospitality, gone away
and announced this decision. We felt
it was fairer and more honest to take
our decision on what we believe to be
the merits of the case and announce it
before my visit. The decision was an
exercise of an entirely independent
judgment by Australia. We have taken
the view that recognition should be
given to the countries which observe
the international standards appropriate
to membership of the United Nations.
We have put forward that view in
respect to mainland China on earlier
occasions.”
Some of the Asian countries Holt
visited may not have found the deci-
sions which Holt had made to their
taste. But they appeared to find his
straightforwardness in saying what he
had done, why he had done what he
had, and the general frankness with
which he stated his views and fears
refreshingly honest and appealing.
For Holt, the visit was undoubtedly
valuable. As he said at its conclusion:
“It does not matter how good are the
reports of your ambassadors and
officials. It is not until you have seen
something of a country and its leaders
for yourself that you can fit those
reports into a proper context.” Whether
the visit advanced Australia’s cause in
Asia remains to be seen. But on the
surface manifestations and the reactions
that the Asian leaders displayed pub-
licly to Holt as the personification of
Australia, it certainly did no harm
and could have done a lot of good.


NEW ZEALAND AND
THE COMMON MARKET
In Harold we trust
WHILE BRITAIN’S decision about the
European Economic Community was
awaited, New Zealand’s Cabinet met to
choose the type of short-haul jet air-
craft for the country’s domestic air-
line, National Airways Corporation.
This decision, expected in a matter of
hours, took four days. The jet choice
was between the British BAC 1-11 and
America’s Boeing 737.
It was common knowledge that the
Government preferred to buy a British
plane; but it had agreed with NAC
that the Boeing was the most suitable
for New Zealand’s requirements.
The final choice in Government
Caucus was delayed by arguments on
trade versus technical advice. Cabinet
Ministers with farms raised the question
of trade with Britain. However, the
Boeing got the nod following a loss by
the “buy British” members.
Announcing the decision, the Min-
ister of Civil Aviation, Mr. Gordon,
said the order for three Boeings to be
delivered next year is subject to favor-
able United States finance. He added:
“Many people probably thought that
Lord Brown, Minister of State in
Britain’s Board of Trade, had come to
New Zealand recently to suggest the
Government ought to buy British air-
craft to help with the trade problems
arising out of the Common Market
negotiations. He came here to talk
about aircraft, to satisfy himself that
the case for the BAC 1-11 had been
properly put to us and adequately con-
sidered. He did not apply any political
pressure.
“I do not believe for one moment
that the British Government, in the
light of all our history, or loyalties, the
breadth of our trading relationships,
and the size of the total problem, will
be influenced in the slightest by the
question of whether or not the British
Aircraft Corporation succeeded in sell-
ing us aeroplanes.”
Nevertheless, the decision apparently
rankled Mr. Harold Wilson enough for
him to comment last week that Com-
monwealth countries were already turn-
ing away from trade with Britain, and
specifically mentioned “plane deals.”
Mr. Wilson’s irritation is important
in view of the tactics New Zealand
has decided on to overcome the
problems set by Britain’s decision to
try to join the European Common
Market; it is putting its trust in the
word of Harold Wilson and hoping
that the Europeans will agree to allow
New Zealand to survive.
True, the Deputy Prime Minister
and Trade Minister, Mr. Marshall, is
going off in two months’ time for “vital
and momentous” talks in London in
which he will argue New Zealand’s
case. But it is clearly now a matter of
British and European goodwill whether
or not permanent arrangements can be
made to keep the country afloat.
Tremors are an everyday affair in
Wellington, seat of the New Zealand
Government. They are hardly noticed,
although deep down there is a conscious-
ness that one day there could be an
earthquake. Something similar was
apparent throughout New Zealand in
the past week as the nation faced up to
the effects of Britain’s EEC bid on
its livestock economy.
There was a tremor in Prime Min-
ister Holyoake’s statement that “the
British accept that New Zealand would
face quite exceptional difficulties if
they joined the Common Market with-
out having negotiated adequate safe-
guards for New Zealand. It is widely
acknowledged that transitional arrange-
ments alone would not be sufficient to
prevent severe dislocation of our
economy. Our particular problems are
also well known to the Governments of
the Community.”
And even more tremulous was Mr.
Prime Minister Holyoake
Marshall’s comment: “It’s not just
primary industry but our standard of
living that is at stake. We will have to
be firm, persistent, and determined. I
am cautiously optimistic about an out-
come that will enable us to survive.”
Sheer survival is the issue for New
Zealand, with pastoral products earning
90 percent of its export income. N.Z.
is the world’s biggest commercial ex-
porter of butter and other dairy
products, it is second only to Australia
in wool, one-third of its million
people live in rural areas, and trade
with Britain has always been its life-
line.
“New Zealand in the past six months
has made more detailed preparations
for the presentation of the kind of
arrangements which could safeguard our
position,” Mr. Marshall said. “In the
next few months it will be the responsi-
bility of New Zealand, together with
Britain, to negotiate in detailed and
practical form the arrangements for
these safeguards.”
The Leader of New Zealand’s Labor
Party, Mr. Kirk, accused the Govern-
ment of totally inadequate preparation
for the inevitable decision.
He added: “It is time for realism,
for a sustained attack on developing
new markets in those parts of the world
where living standards are rising rapidly
and where an increased demand for
high-quality produce from New Zealand
or some other country has to be met.”
One important field of self-help in
which New Zealand has been busy lately
is the tourist trade, and like many
another country has done, the first
courting steps were directed at peri-
patetic, moneyed Americans.
In April, New Zealand’s first tourist
mission, organised by the Government
Tourist and Publicity Department and
the N.Z. Holiday and Travel Associa-
tion, swung through Honolulu, Los
Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego,
Vancouver, Anchorage, and Seattle.
More than 1000 agents got the latest
image of the Dominion from talks and
films.
For double impact there was
another selling mission to the U.S., a
manufacturers’ delegation seeking new
outlets for forest products, crockery,
and carpets.
And early this month there was a
N.Z. Dairy Board delegation to Japan,
where N.Z. trade is now worth £N.Z.I4
million ($25 million) annually. En-
couragingly, on a visit to N.Z. this
month, Mr. Masayuki Echigo, senior
managing director of the giant indus-
trial company C. Itoh, predicted an
increased trade for N.Z. wool, meat,
and dairy produce.
Clearly in the search for new markets
pressure will be on Australia to become
one of them, to whatever extent might
be possible.
It would not be true to say that the
New Zealander in-the-street is already
talking more favorably about union
with Australia, or of an ANZAC
Market, but these are early days when
the nation is still waiting apprehen-
sively to see what the tremors mean.
Sir John Ormond, chairman of the
New Zealand Meat Producers’ Board,
summed up the “trust-Britain” line
when he said: “We have been assured
special arrangements will be made for
New Zealand lamb. While we accept
Britain’s decision about the Common
Market we will fight every inch of the
way to look after New Zealand’s
interests and the farmers we represent.
Mr. Wilson stated in the House of
Commons that special arrangements will
be made for New Zealand and I accept
the word of the British Prime Min-
ister.”

SUCH A
LOT OF
HOT AIR
Barry Jones enjoys the crossfire of radio talk-back callers
BY BRIAN BUCKLEY
“YES, MR. JONES, I’m a housewife,”
she began. “And I resent being called
a cabbage because I prefer to stay home
and look after my young family.”
“And how old are your children?”
inquired Jones.
“Three and five,” replied the house-
wife.
“Well, what are you going to do
when you’ve finished wiping their noses
and washing their dirty faces?”
“I don’t know.”
“That’s what I mean by becoming
a cabbage,” retorted Jones.
The crossfire continued for a few
minutes until the woman was thanked
and forced to ring off. The switchboard
was jammed with callers, each with one
ear attentive to the phone receiver, the
other to the radio, all of them waiting
their turn to talk back to Barry Jones.
The ratings have not yet been esti-
mated, but if the switchboard at Mel-
bourne’s Station 3DB is a guide, the
new direct-communication programs
are the biggest things to happen to
radio since the hit parade.
In Melbourne there are also “Talk
It Over” with Pat Jarrett, the “Dial
For Dollars” quiz, “Sports Forum,”
“Open Line” with Norman Banks, and
the “Bill Howie Show.”
The Sydney programs include Mike
Walsh’s “Two-Way Radio,” Ormsby
Wilkins’ “Open Line,” 2GB’s “At Your
Service,” a fair amount of listener-
commentator chat led by Anne Deveson;
John Laws, Robert Kennedy, and even,
at 10.30 p.m., 2UE’s “Highlights of
Open Line.” Brisbane has Bill Gates’
“Live Wire” and also an “Open Line.”
The Jones “talk-back” program went
into public rehearsal last February be-
tween 5.30-7.00 p.m. At that time it was
not legal to broadcast the listener’s end
of the conversation. Jones proposed the
topics and listeners answered back via
written messages read out by an
announcer. Subjects included “Should
we have a royal family?” “The Pill,”
and “The Space Race.” Despite the
cumbersome method some 40 or 50 calls
were received every evening.
Then came a change in the PMG
regulations on April 17, which allowed
broadcasting stations direct communi-
cation except for a seven-second
delay between what the listener says
and when his voice comes across the
air, a delay which allows the producer
to go for his “panic button” and erase
nasty words. The delay can be con-
fusing for talkers-back who have their
radios close to the telephone, and they
are usually asked to turn their sets down
or off.
When the Jones show changed to
the morning, protests were issued from
all over the State. “We like having this
marvellous man at our tea-table
put him back,” wrote one fan.
The producer of Jones’ “Talk Back,”
Peter Surrey, is excited not only by
the popularity of his program. He says
that the new listener-commentator
communication has “won back radio’s
self-respect.”
The Jones show seems to prove him
right. Surrey estimates that between
60 and 80 people try to talk back to
Barry every morning between 9 and 10.
The talk-back number has eight lines
and they are continually engaged. Those'
who can’t get through frequently com-
plain to the girl on the station’s normal
business number. Some complain to
the PMG.
One woman in the Western District
now tapes the morning program and
plays it back to her family over the
evening meal.
Others are more critical. A woman
who described herself as “a listener of
30 years and very disappointed” com-
plained to the station manager: “Have
you people taken leave of your senses,
allowing Barry Jones to take over. He
is taking full advantage of your lapse
by promoting Communistic views on
every subject his friends ring up about.
This morning they were as follows: anti-
football, anti-hanging, anti-Christian,
anti-police, anti-progress . . .”
Another listener advised Jones “to
migrate to a Red Country as soon as
possible and oblige all loyal Australians
who wish to keep our country free of
Communists . . .”
But, on the show, those who talk back
have less animosity. Most of the callers
are women, and their questions are
never frivolous. Listening for the first
time, one is surprised at how articulate
and serious most callers are.
The questions raised are usually of
general concern; not so many of the
“there’s a big puddle in my child’s
school playground” kind as of the “Is
the Education Department too huge and
rigid?” variety.
In Jones’ discussions with callers,
the talk-back sometimes becomes a
monologue—he tries to work from the
particular question or comment to its
social, political, or ideological context.
He carries the show along with a
boundless Methodist, Reformist en-
thusiasm. There are no cameras, but his
arms wave and his hands gesture as he
tells the lady who bought a discolored
egg to “phone the Egg Board,” and
encourages another who feels steamed
up about the meanness of our social
services to “go and join a local political
party.” (The station now sends out to
inquirers a roneoed sheet explaining
how to join a political party.)
By contrast, Melbourne’s other lead-
ing talk-back man, the übiquitous Nor-
man Banks, conducts a more parish-
pump style of discussion. The callers
seem less sophisticated arid rather
more cranky. However, one suspects
that a number of them know what
Banks means when he lets drop an
expression such as “pernicious cos-
mopolitan influences.”
The Sydney two-way programs vary
in intensity from the service program
on GB, where all kinds of profound
advice is dispensed by the most learned
of people, to the evening talk-back
and music show of John Laws, who lets
the listeners talk and keeps his own
opinions in the background.
The latter style may not last long.
The most successful programs are those
in which the commentator emerges as
a strong and opinionated personality.
This has been the case, also, in the
United States, where two-way programs
have been high in the ratings for years.
The most worried men in the game
are the disc jockeys. The bottom is
slipping out of the market—for canned
music and tinned mania—in the new
passion for talk. Managers and pr°'
ducers of the talk-back stations do not
disguise their pleasure in the new pro-
grams. They feel that ratings will rise,
that advertisers will be attracted by the
fact that people are now actively listen-
ing rather than passively hearing, and
that some of the best talk-back com-
mentators offer competition to television.
They agree with Peter Surrey that
this is commercial radio’s chance to win
back self-respect.

OVERSEAS
Australia writes a cheque to
Indonesia’s New Order
By PETER SAMUEL
AUSTRALIA IS LIKELY to give
Indonesia $5 million later this year to
help cover its $2OO million balance of
payments gap. An interdepartmental
committee (these committees are Can-
berra bureacracy’s most powerful insti-
tutions) is expected to pass recom-
mendations for this and other external
aid to Cabinet soon.
Dr. Emil Salem, a University of
Indonesia economist, now on General
Suharto’s staff, helped consolidate
departmental support for the proposal.
During an informal two-week visit to
Australia he greatly impressed officials
with the realism and determination of
the New Order to lift the Indonesian
economy out of the corrupt inflationary
mire which was Sukarno’s heritage to
his people.
Decontrol and debureaucratisation
are the key words these days in Indo-
nesian economic policy-making circles.
Realising that inefficiency and corrup-
tion in the Public Service cannot be
immediately exorcised, the strategy is
rather to cut out the opportunities for
them by dismantling the huge struc-
ture of regulations of the Old Order.
The ssm. aid which Australia is
granting will probably be given under
a new so-called BE (Bonus Export)
system, enabling private businessmen
and State instrumentalities to bid by
auction for import certificates for
goods on an essential imports list. The
ssm. is, however, the bare minimum
we could decently offer in view of other
contributions.
America was, as usual, the first
country to grant aid s6sm. con-
ditional on other countries combining
to make the total up to s2oom. Japan
has decided to contribute s6om., and
West Germany sl3m. They are making
their contributions in the form of long-
term loans at low interest rates, while
ours will, as usual, be a straight-out
grant.
Meanwhile the country’s stabilisation
program is showing some signs of suc-
cess. The rupiah has been firm in rela-
tion to the dollar for almost five
months now. Inflation has at least been
cut back from rates of 40 and 50 per-
cent to four percent recently, though,
of course, the Indonesians measure their
inflation by the month rather than by
the year. The price of rice in Djakarta
is Rpl2, a small fall from New Year
prices and the same as in the latter
half of last year. With Government
enterprises well on the way to covering
costs and a general austerity program
being carried out, the huge inflation-
producing Government deficit is dim-
inishing.
There is, however, a long way to go
before economic stability can be
claimed, and in the meantime all sorts
of dilemmas are being thrown up.
As Emil Salem put it: “We have had
to undergo painful and quick surgery
with very rusty old tools.”
Plenty of complications are inevit-
ably developing. They used to say in
Sukarno’s time, Salem tells us, that
there was only one factory in the whole
of Djakarta which worked three shifts
and efficiently: the note-printing plant.
Now there are no factories working
three shifts and very few working anv
The “Old Order” of luxuries like this ornamental pool in Djakarta has ended
Dr. Pang Lay Kim
where near single-shift capacity. An
intense credit squeeze afflicts all trade;
the suspension of work on Sukarno’s
prestige skyscrapers and sports stadiums
has thrown the building industry into
a deep slump. Freer trade has flooded
the local market with imports which
heavily underprice domestic products.
Textiles are a case in point, with
certain Djakarta factories virtually
closed down due to their inability to
compete with Hong Kong and Taiwan-
ese cloth. There are suggestions, too,
that rice imports are discouraging local
production, though this year’s harvest
is an exceedingly good one.
Another Indonesian economist, Dr.
Pang Lay Kim, thinks his Government
is taking its free-market philosophy
rather too seriously.
He admits the value of cheap imports
in the anti-inflationary effort, but thinks
the country should not go on spending
scarce foreign exchange on things it
can produce with existing factories and
otherwise idle workers. He would like
to see simple bans on the import of
certain lines of textiles to get those
factories moving again.
And Dr. Pang, a fat, jolly fellow at
present working at the Australian
National University, thinks that private
business may be the key to Indonesian
recovery. A former Djakarta business-
man himself, he describes the interest
in Indonesia currently being shown by
leading international business executives
as very encouraging. The great “break-
through,” to use his word, came at the
Pacific Industrial Council in Sydney
recently, when 100 of the world’s top
businessmen decided to send a survey
team to Indonesia to examine prospects
for private enterprise and draw up a


list of projects. Dr. Pang envisages the
formation of consortiums of companies
t 0 spread risks and get things moving
quickly.
Officials in the Department of Trade
and Industry across the other side of
the lake speak enthusiastically of the
new potentialities of the Indonesian
market under the New Order. They say
our businessmen who used to overfly
Indonesia on international trips are now
dropping into Djakarta like flies.
Trade and investment relations be-
tween our two countries are, however,
hampered at present by poor communi-
cations lack of a regular shipping
service and appalling telegraphic links.
The Japanese have just installed a
direct telex link with Djakarta, enabling
quotes to be given from Tokyo within
hours of an inquiry at the Japanese
Export Trade Organisation office. Cor-
responding communication with Aus-
tralia takes weeks.
Common Market
Wilson, a nuisance
PROBABLY President de Gaulle him-
self does not know quite how he is
going to handle Britain’s request to
enter the European community. It is
quite plain that he would like not to
have to deal with the matter at all. Mr.
Wilson is being a nuisance. But now he
cannot simply be brushed aside: the
problem is what to do with him.
General de Gaulle has three options.
He can blackball Britain again. He can
drag out talks to the equivalent of a
veto. Or he can agree to Britain’s entry,
setting a price for his assent.
So far the French have been busy
suggesting that the British cannot
genuinely pay the price of entry on
agriculture, on sterling, or on foreign
trade policy. This plays on the tradi-
tional suspicions of France’s five Com-
mon Market partners that the British
might still call the community in ques-
tion by a hundred and one apparently
technical objections.
But the French show signs of realising
that delaying tactics may not work. For
Mr. Wilson, true to himself, has shown
great ingenuity in keeping his options
open and, by some accounts, has pro-
vided bait for the French to hook him
on. But they cannot be sure that such
a slippery fish is not playing them.
So General de Gaulle must be weigh-
ing the pros and cons of another out-
right unargued Non! Many people
think that he would not dare to do
such a thing again. He could, of course,
just for the hell of it. A veto, although
unlikely in the immediate future, should
not be dismissed out of hand. But it
could not really be delivered lightly.
Today the British leadership, in all
Parties, is as united as it could be on
entry to the community, and it will be
hard to claim, as in 1963, that Britain
is in two minds.
Even in France, de Gaulle’s authority
is not what it was at the height of his
power four years ago. If he uttered
another interdict, the Five would not
revolt. But the colossal act of naked
negation would ruin his own hopes of
being the architect of European great-
ness. Whatever tomorrow’s Europe
might be, he would not have had the
last word in dictating its creation.
This is Mr. Wilson’s chance. If he
can really convince General de Gaulle
of his determination to enter the Euro-
pean community, he has a chance of
coming to terms with him. One of the
best ways to outflank the General is
President de Gaulle
to cling publicly to the letter and the
aspirations of the community.
This is the unavoidable basis for any
compromise with General de Gaulle.
Some people even argue that no more
is needed. They may be right. Yet it is
hard to imagine the General saying Yes
without some political deal that would
prove how he, once more, changed the
course of history.
There may be, perhaps, a character-
istic asking-price for Gaullist assent:
some gesture to show that Britain is
really European. That is, less tied to the
United States, particularly in defence.
It is difficult, however, to see what
gain there would be for anyone, Presi-
dent de Gaulle included, in a British
withdrawal from NATO. And the
British Government itself, if leaks from
Washington are to be believed, is con-
templating some further scaling-down
from east of Suez anyway. But there is
the nuclear deterrent.
It is plain that a Franco-British deter-
rent is a pipedream, and not a particu-
larly pleasant one at that: no one
imagines General de Gaulle, or even
Mr. Wilson, sharing his own national
responsibility with the head of another
Government. But joint efforts on pro-
ducing missiles could be another matter.
Britain will shortly face the problem
of whether to make a bid for Poseidons,
carrying multiple warheads (which it
would have to develop itself), to replace
its present Polaris missiles. The Ameri-
cans, the only possible suppliers of the
new missiles, are not keen on another
Nassau agreement to keep Britain’s
deterrent going for another generation.
At the same time the French, who
seem to be doing fairly well with their
rocketry, may shortly be able to com-
plement British warheads. The question
is at least technically open.
If the French and British got together
on missiles in return for the admission
of Britain into the European com-
munity, the “independent British deter-
rent” would have served some tangible
purpose. And even the Americans
would not be wholly shocked.
(AN "ECONOMIST" REPORT)
Singapore
Toughening up
NEVER ONE TO waste time or
emotion, Singapore’s Mr. Lee Kuan-
yew has characteristically not been
wringing his hands over the cutback
of British bases. Instead he has sug-
gested that labor made redundant by
the curtailment should be re-employed
by British industry in shipbuilding and
repairs, civil jet maintenance, and low-
priced manufacturing generally.
He has promised preferential treat-
ment to the British, whom, he asserts,
he would far prefer to the Japanese,
Germans, and Scandinavians. Cynics
say he has said the same thing privately
to the Japanese, Germans, and Scan-
dinavians; if he has, fair enough. But
on plain evidence, the Japanese have
built their own dockyard at the Jurong
industrial estate while Mr. Lee has
already given free dock facilities to
the British shipping interests.
There are daunting difficulties ahead.
Indonesian trade remains largely a
pious hope. Industrialisation is the only
durable solution to fundamental prob-
lems which are too heavy even for Lee
Kuan-yew and the “rugged society” he
is seeking to develop.
Mr. Lee has ridden crisis after crisis.
But what course can Singapore continue
to follow effectively by self effort alone?
Tough glands, a willingness to go out
in the midday sun, and even tough
local leadership are only part of the
answer.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Following the “Mob”
By CHARLES HIGHAM
WORD FROM FILM circles that
“They’re a Weird Mob” grossed $3
million in Australia comes at the same
time that the “season” is on us again
in announcements of Hollywood films
to be made here. As usual, a certain
amount of scepticism is necessary, but
one wishes the various ventures well.
Two new Ned Kelly ventures seem
to be in the wind: Michael Caine, now
the hottest thing in new stars, is said
still to be coming to make a version
of the story directed by Lewis Gilbert,
and Vic Morrow, first seen as the
hoodlum in “The Blackboard Jungle,”
and more recently the star of TV series
“Combat,” hopes to come here to shoot
the story at Ajax-Visatone studios. How-
ever, Brian Chirlian of Ajax says that
there may be legal problems, as the
relatives of Ned Kelly could lodge
action under the N.S.W. Defamation
Act. Mad as this sounds, it apparently
does present a possible danger to the
project, and this is something Chirlian
will be looking into in the next few
weeks.
Last week I talked in Sydney with
Louis Edelman, veteran producer of
such celebrated films as “Bullets or
Ballots,” “White Heat,” and the Chopin
biography “A Song to Remember,” and
Lewis Allen, equally gifted director of
the ghost story “The Uninvited” and
the Victorian melodrama “So Evil
My Love” (both starring Ray Milland).
These men plan to make “The Return
of the Boomerang,” the story of Adam
Peabody, a Boston man who is abducted
from San Francisco to Sydney in the
1850 s, imprisoned wrongly for murder,
and released on a special amnesty when
he marries a convict girl who is em-
ployed at the Female Factory in Parra-
matta. The couple, who have never pre-
viously met, get a land grant from the
Government as her dowry and settle
on the Hawkesbury, where they have
to fight off “natural disasters and bush-
rangers.”
“I originally intended to make this
picture in French Guiana because
Devil’s Island had similar rules of re-
leasing prisoners who married female
convicts,” Mr. Edelman told me. “But
when I wanted to do it the French were
disbanding Devil’s Island and would
not let me make it. That was back in
the 19505. So I thought: someone must
have done this kind of thing somewhere
else. And then I found the French had
borrowed the amnesty idea from the
Australians. So I got together with
Lowell Barrington, an American writer,
and gave him the idea. He turned it into
a novel. But it was many years before I
could get here to plan the picture.”
Edelman and Allen have been scout-
ing locations in the vicinity, and have
decided to use Nowra, Parramatta,
the Shoalhaven and Hawkesbury Rivers,
Victoria Barracks, several churches,
Government House, and Vaucluse
House, where they plan to stage a
garden-party sequence. The Mitchell
Library, Edelman said, had done a sterl-
ing job of research on the project (“half
the staff were working for us”), and
among the historical figures who will be
represented in the film is the Governor
of N.S.W. Location shooting starts in
September, and will take “50 or 60
days.” The screenplay is by T. E. B.
Clarke, author of the famous Ealing
comedies, including “The Lavender Hill
Mob” and “Passport to Pimlico.” There
will be an American male star to play
Adam Peabody and an English girl will
be signed to play the heroine, Bess Mc-
Guire. The art direction will be super-
vised by Hal Pereira, of Paramount
Studios. Details of budget and release
have not been set. Ajax Studios facili-
ties will be used.
Also on the agenda is a project by
Robert. Vaughan; less certain is
“Windows of Heaven,” based on a high-
powered novel about clashes between
blacks and whites by Roger Cleeve set
in the mid-19th century and to be shot
in the Blue Mountains by producer
Michael Royce-Wood for Erosmark, a
German company. According to the
film’s associate producer, Michael
Hyde, the German star Michael Kirner
has been signed for a leading role, and
Laurence Harvey, Ava Gardner, and
Geraldine Page have been approached
to act others. Further films in the wind
are the long-delayed Fox version of
Darcy Niland’s “Call Me When The
Cross Turns Over,” with Sean Connery
and Diane Cilento, and a project of
Mickey Rooney’s, as yet untitled.
Meanwhile, someone seems actually
to have achieved the feat of finishing
a film in this area. This is the Central
Australia story “Journey Out of Dark-
ness,” starring Ed Devereaux, directed
by Jim Trainor. The “rushes” have
come through and a finished cut is
expected in June; release will be
through Greater Union here. This story
of a tense relationship between a black
tracker and an outback policeman had
originally been intended as an “art
picture” for release at the various festi-
vals, but it may well, in the final cut,
look more like an “actioner” for the
general circuits.
In the past many projects have
foundered here because of the problem
of transporting crew to Australia and
obtaining of first-class equipment in
some studios in this area. Let’s hope that
the success of the “Mob” will encourage
all the studios here to invest in facilities
of international standard.
Music
For the sceptics
By PAUL FROLICH
Little Symphony Orchestra. Soloist,
Julian Bream. Conservatorium,
Sydney.
THE PROGRAM for the Little Sym-
phony Orchestra’s concert at the Sydney
Conservatorium contained a leaflet in-
viting listeners to a televised concert
and was headed “We’re looking for an
audience.” Although looking for an audi-
ence has often been the ABC’s concern
in the past, and poor bookings for this
year’s Sydney Youth Concerts suggest
increasing future attention to the prob-
lem, they have rarely done so in as
original a fashion as they did at this
concert. Almost a quarter of the audi-
ence, including most members of the
Press, found themselves locked out.
The single entrance to the Conserva-
torium Hall was so poorly managed that
at 8 p.m., official starting time, a large
crowd remained lined up in the foyer;
in spite of this, the door was shut and
the opening work, Corelli’s “Christmas
Concerto,” remained unheard by many,
including myself. It was fortunate for
the ABC that the large majority had
come to hear Julian Bream rather than
the orchestra; otherwise, indignation
might have been expressed by more
than angry muttering.
The remainder of the program con-
sisted of four works: two guitar con-
certi and two 20th-century orchestral
pieces. Turina’s “L’Oracion del Torero
is one of the Spanish composer’s char-
acteristic and temperamental works. Its
performance under Mr. Post’s cautious
direction was competent, but unexciting.
Many of the score’s subtleties failed to
emerge, and the whole thing sounded
somewhat tentative and passionless,
played with a lack of delicacy which
bordered on the clumsy.
The 20 string players, though by no
means all from the front desks, were
much more successful with Benjamin
Britten’s youthful “Variations on a
Theme of Frank Bridge.” This music
was first brought to us by the Boyd


Neel Orchestra in 1947, ten years after
its composition, and it has stood the
t es t of time remarkably well.
Julian Bream’s appearance in two
concerti was quite an exciting event as,
by local tradition, visiting guitarists are
not usually accorded the honor of per-
forming with our orchestras. The first
concerto, Castelnuovo-Tedesco’s opus
99 ( written for Segovia in 1939, is a
true virtuoso concerto. Opening with
an orchestral tutti, it includes tuneful
dialogues between soloist and orchestra
and a fine cadenza in the slow move-
ment. Much of it, try as one may,
remains music of some banality, but
Julian Bream did his best to make it
seem bigger and more interesting than
it really is. Despite his reticence, he
achieved his aim admirably and orch-
estral support was good.
Malcolm Arnold’s 1959 concerto,
composed for Bream, is a fine work,
in much better taste than I expected
from my general acquaintance with this
composer’s output. After a slightly
folksy first movement comes a quite
remarkable lento, written as an elegy
in memory of Django Reinhardt and
generally based on blues themes. This
is music of considerable intricacy and
beauty; the performance by soloist and
orchestra alike was movingly con-
vincing. The final movement, pervaded
by Arnold’s usual dry humor, gives
the guitarist a great deal of scope for
virtuoso display. Mr. Bream played the
whole of this unusual work with aplomb
and great artistry, and has, I feel cer-
tain, convinced a few more sceptics
that the guitar is indeed a serious
musical instrument.
Films
Curtain call
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Romeo and Juliet. Director, Paul
Czinner.
CZINNER’S previous ballet films were
photographed stage performances with
a few cameras in fixed positions, which
the director used in turn with an almost
audible click. They were interesting
and useful records but difficult for a
movie critic to assess since they didn’t
really try to be films. But with “Romeo
and Juliet,” we are told, Czinner has
moved into the world of cinema; this
has been presented directly as a film.
Well, has it? It may have been per-
formed on a sound stage but it looks
awfully like a theatre stage; the cameras
are, perhaps, more numerous and their
use more fluent, but Czinner has made
sure that we don’t get any wild cine-
matic ideas from this by having the
Covent Gardens curtains rise and fall
between acts and by employing an in-
defatigable, though invisible, audience
to applaud to the echo as the red velvet
drapes descend. Bless my soul, at the
end we even have curtain calls, with
everyone who just died by violence
coming out, bowing and smiling!
Still, viewed as ballet, the film has
considerable interest. Kenneth Mac-
millan’s choreography is not entirely
satisfactory the roguish gaiety of the
market-place scenes is hard to take, and
Juliet’s first scene with the Nurse gives
the impression that she is not only a
young girl but a half-witted one and
his groupings of the ensemble as back-
ground is static and unimaginative. But
he comes into his own in the more
intimate scenes. The two pas de deux
of Romeo and Juliet have a tender,
lyrical poetry which is brilliantly
parodied and distorted in Juliet’s scene
with Paris and when Romeo tries to
revive the apparently dead Juliet.
Margot Fonteyn is, of course, too
old for Juliet, a fact which the camera
makes mercilessly clear, particularly in
her early, childish scenes; after she has
fallen in love her maturity is not so in-
congruous. Anyway, the years haven’t
affected her dancing, with its magical
combination of grace and strength, its
underlying deep feeling. Also, she is a
very considerable actress; her despair
after Romeo’s exile and on discovering
his dead body is profoundly convincing
and moving.
In this regard she is streets ahead
of Nureyev, whose miming is perfunc-
tory and lacking in fire; his dancing, of
course, is above criticism, though the
very perfection of the technique rather
defeats its own ends in making it look
sometimes so easy as to be almost
mechanical.
Now that Paul Czinner has moved
his dancers away from the stage (though
not very far away) it is to be hoped
that he goes a step further and gives
us a ballet composed specifically for
filming, preferably by a choreographer
who knows something of screen tech-
nique.
Theatre
Company of one
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
The Canterbury Tales. Chaucer.
Dramatised by Rob Inglis. Indepen-
dent, Sydney.
The Caretaker. Harold Pinter. Gradu-
ate Theatre Company. Union
Theatre, Sydney University.
There Will Be An Interval Of Fifteen
Minutes. Revue. Directed by William
Orr. Phillip, Sydney.
THE ADVANTAGE of a one-man
show is that the actor, who also adapts
his own material, produces it, lights it,
and designs the stage setting, can, pro-
vided he is a man of sufficient taste,
energy, and imagination, make sure
that the performance reaches a high
standard in every detail. The difficulty
Rob Inglis in “Canterbury Talcs."
Independent, Sydney
is that one man must turn himself into
a whole company. When Rob Inglis
gestures toward the invisible company
he has created at the end of his per-
formance, the audience applauds de-
lightedly. Whether he is playing that
administrative genius, Mine Host of the
Tabard Inn, or the jolly four-times-
married Wife of Bath, Chanticleer, that
prince of roosters, or his darling Lady
Pertelote, whether he is trotting off ta
Canterbury astride a rough-hewn
chair, or perched on top of that chair
atop the refectory table as poor old
John the cuckolded carpenter sus-
pended in his barrel from the attic
ceiling, awaiting the ebbing of Noah’s
flood, Rob Inglis invariably suits the
action to the word with a lively skill.
Two other features of this produc-
tion give it an unmistakably profes-
sional stamp. One is the brisk pace
which Rob Inglis maintains through-
out. The other is the excellent arrange-
ment of the program, which is climaxed
by the uproarious vulgarity of the
drunken Miller’s tale.
“The Caretaker” is well acted, especi-
ally by Peter Collingwood, who plays
the unlovable old tramp Davies. But
Terence Clark’s production suffers
from the snail-like pace which mars so
much of our amateur and semi-
professional theatre. Admittedly, Pin-
ter’s is the theatre of pregnant pauses,
but this is the theatre of excruciating
hiatuses. The effect of deliberateness
and tautness which should be produced
by the pauses becomes slackness and
tedium.
Someone remarked to me the other
day that, as well as typical Pinter
characters, we are beginning to have
typical Pinter actors. In “The Care-
taker” I think of Mick, the successful
brother who has his own van, as the
most Pinterish character in the play:
sharp, aggressive, leather-jacketed, a
man who can hold his own in the jungle
of modern life. Even though he is pro-
tective toward his slow brother, his
attitude to Davies is relentless. Arthur
Dignam’s quiet performance seemed to
me too gentle for Mick, on whom a
great deal of the tension in the play
depends. Pinter himself played this part
in one of the London productions and


it would be fascinating to know how he
interpreted it.
Revue can be a very sophisticated
form of theatre, but our revues show us
to be simple souls and unswervingly
parochial. Leaving aside Barry Hum-
phries, a remarkable exception, we have
no talent for satire and, apparently, no
interest in politics or anything that
might upset anybody. Making fun of
a well-known woman columnist is the
height of our daring.
However, we do have some tradi-
tions of Australian humor, one dry,
knockabout and simple, and we have
also produced some good comedians.
In this show we have Gloria Dawn
and June Salter, and the sketches
which exploit their talents are very
funny. The very best is one which
uses both these funny girls together.
The other sketches range from weak to
abysmal and I would cut half of them
out if I were the producer.
The queen of the revue is Gloria
Dawn. Whether she is being blonde and
brassy and bouncing as a barmaid, or
an amazon of the Roller Game, or
dumb and immovable and quintessen-
tially Australian as the relentlessly
munching wife of a diet-conscious hus-
band, she is a marvellous clown. June
Salter, dry, witty, and sophisticated,
is the perfect foil for her. Together, in
an art gallery as a couple of middle-
aged suburban housewives doing their
best with culture as they slowly circle
round a large Henry Moore-like lady,
they are side-splitting.
If only more of the sketches were as
good as the best half dozen, this revue
would be very good.
Enormous juke-box
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Sweet Charity. Coleman and Fields.
Her Majesty’s, Melbourne.
Servant of Two Masters. Goldoni,
Russell Street, Melbourne.
All in the Family. Marc-Gilbert Sauva-
jon. St. Martin’s, Melbourne.
HER MAJESTY’S has become a
2000-seat juke-box. Deposit some coins,
press the promotional button and the
mechanism selects another musical. The
latest to slide into position is “Sweet
Charity,” very much the flipside for
“Funny Girl.” Like its predecessor, it
features a gawky, self-deprecating
heroine who wants love (to yearning
music), gets a man (to tra-la-la music)
and loses him (to smiling-through-tears
music). The main point of difference
is that “Funny Girl’s” score had bigger
hits and its book employed bigger
cliches.
“Sweet Charity” is, in fact, the
superior musical. It has got some
tough, West-Side-style lyrics and any
toothaching sweetness in the plot is
anaesthetised by the occasional injection
of cynicism.
As well, it has two notable set pieces.
The first takes us to a discotheque for
some stunning choreography by Betty
Pounder. The second, introduced to us
by the Church of the Month Club, is
an irreverent jazz service called “The
Rhythm of Life.” It is very funny.
Nancye Elayes plays Charity as
though her life depended on it, and
Judith Roberts and Buster Skeggs give
good support as her gum-chewing
cronies. Robert Randolph’s sets have
the cool Magoo look, and Fred
Herbert’s production is fairly animated.
Commedia del’ Art enjoyed a three-
century vogue, and left vestigial traces
in the harlequinade, Punch and Judy
shows, the routines of knockabout
clowns and the comedies of Moliere.
The masked actors were required to
improvise to a prearranged scenario,
but by the 18th century they’d talked
themselves out. Enter Carlo Goldoni
with formal scripts.
His “Servant” has an “As-You-Like-
It” plot, with the heroine masquerading
as a man, and lots of sleight-of-hand
and confusions. However, Goldoni’s
plays in translation lack the Elizabethan
lilt, and this is_emphasised by Ogilvie’s
lavish production and the cast’s
elaborate mime.
Robin Ramsay is splendid as the
crotchety Pantalone, and Dennis Olsen
impressed as the mountainous inn-
keeper. Alan Hopgood played the ser-
vant Truffaldino with the facial and
physical mobility of Harpo Marx, but
as usual John Gregg (Silvio) stole most
of the laughs. But while the production
is a must for the few remaining theatri-
cal devotees, it’s not recommended for
the thrill-seeker.
Nor is “All in the Family,” a comedy-
thriller which is neither comic nor
thrilling.

Love as luv
By ROBERT WARD
Luv. Murray Schisgal. Sheridan, Ade-
laide.
As Long As They’re Happy. Vernon
Sylvaine. Union, Adelaide.
Calamity Jane. Fain & Webster. Arts
Adelaide. Shedley, Elizabeth, S.A.
“LUV” is a comedy with a cast of three
written, I suspect, for the American
university or intimate theatre. It falls
into the same genre as Carlino’s “Cages”
and Manhoff’s “The Owl and The
Pussycat,” both of which were recently
performed in Adelaide, and, like them,
is remarkable for its economy of style,
its technical proficiency, and its ironic
handling of current American intel-
lectual postures, sexual and moral
absurdities, and modern love and mar-
riage.
The play is set on a bridge in New
York. Don Barker’s Harry, a heavy-
footed gangling neurotic, prone to
sudden catalepsy, meets an old school
friend, Milt, played by Edwin Duryea
as a scuttling, scampering, highly strung
wide-boy. Harry has arrived to commit
suicide, Milt to meet and kill Ellen,
his wife, who is played by Louise Smart
as a kind of de beauvoiresque chorus-
girl-quiz kid. Milt convinces Harry
that “luv” is better than suicide, and
that, ideally, he should find it in Ellen
and marry her, which would leave Milt
free to marry his mistress. This is
arranged in the first act, and the second
shows us what happens four months
later.
The Sheridan production of “Luv”
is an unqualified success. It is one of
the best things the theatre has done.
I feel this is due as much to the ideal
casting and Jean Marshall’s direction
as it is to the play.
“As Long As They’re Happy” is an
English drawing-room comedy, prob-
ably written during the ’fifties, in which
a stockbroker finds it hard to compre-
hend his youngest daughter’s infatuation
with a pop-singer, an elder daughter’s
marriage to an existentialist, and his
wife’s dithering tolerance of everything
and everybody.
Good, solid English commonsense
resolves the situation, then a third
daughter arrives with a cowboy hus-
band; curtain. I did not find it a very
amusing play, and the actresses made
it even less so. Steve Ramsey plays the
stockbroker with a certain ease and
confidence, but the part really needs
a stockier figure with a rounder, deeper
English resonance.
The Metropolitan Light Opera
Company’s production of “Calamity
Jane” is quite impressive. Effective
musical comedy (the marshalling of
singers, dancers, orchestra, etc.) on
what must be a small budget is a hard
thing to achieve, and the company
must be applauded for what is on the
whole a more than adequate presenta-
tion.

Art
Swinging show
By ELWYN LYNN
Georges Invitation Art Prize. Georges
Gallery, Melbourne.
Annual Interstate Exhibition, Contem-
porary Art Society. Argus Gallery,
Melbourne.
THE GEORGES Invitation Prize
has become one of the most significant
in Australia; not only is it second only
to the Transfield in monetary value,
it has had as previous winners John
Olsen, Len French, Roger Kemp and
Fred Williams, it gives a minor prize
for younger talent, and is also a
microcosm of the art world. As such it
makes nonsense of the jeremiads on the
evils of internationalisation of art and
the eclipse of personal expression.
Modern modes are tackled with such
elation, sheer enjoyment and that ac-
complishment that Patrick Heron
praises in the suppressed ABC-TV
program for “Spectrum,” that the
resultant heady variety and lively
individuality makes me wonder where
all the imitative uniformity that I read
about is hiding.
A swinging show in more ways than
one, it has paintings suspended by silver
chains from the black ceiling; Robert
Jacks’ elegantly decorated yellow tri-
angle seems about to split the floor and
Watkins’ yellow diamond, where two
scalloped rivers of orange and pink-
red converge on purple blocks seems to
hold space in suspension. Watkins,
Jacks, Jordan, Earle, and Aspden come
closest to an international style, but
their variety of approach is most re-
assuring: Jordan’s parallel bars of sub-
dued hues twice break into yellow
climaxes; there is no equal to the beauti-
ful, incandescent color in Aspden’s pink
vertical on a green, banded by rich,
pulsating purple; and with relaxed
finesse, Earle combines Matisse’s color
with the indolent flow of art nouveau.
They are all part of what Alan
McCulloch calls the civilised revolu-
tion, but some of their Pop counter-
parts are boisterous and indecorous:
Baldessin has an actual white tube
emerging from a brown-and-white
painting of woman and architecture;
Ross Morrow tosses about pop-clues
(two are flaccid-fleshed nude photo-
graphs) to a slightly menacing prob-
lem; Reinhard sets his large, firm-
fleshed nude photograph against the
deadness of grey streets; Larter has a
box construction with holes to peep
through you can see a Pollock, a
huge eye, and a cavernous mouth; Les
Kossatz lets a whirlwind loose about a
garden and a shield bearing the Union
Jack. It forces its way out of the pic-
ture and forms curving freeways. Not
as controlled and as analytic as the
ecole-de-Paris and Gorky-ish forms of
John Adam, who took the promising-
painter prize of $lOO, or as the toughly
balanced forms in Boynes, the Kossatz
has a zany recklessness.
It is Sansom who paints with the
greatest compulsion, whirling intestinal
shapes below a photograph of Francis
Bacon (a kind of back-handed homage
called One of Us Must Know), and
in his drawing making a virtue of
grubbiness, smudges, and torn paper.
Most of the Popsters share with the
other exhibitors something that is
becoming more noticeable in Australian
painting: the expressive use of scale.
If Rapotec’s golden-brown explosive
Experience in Seville looks a little com-
pressed, Sibley is achieving a new,
relaxed ease and exciting lyricism.
Connor places his sliding, jelly-like,
liquescent pink head most tellingly on
black, though the black is somewhat
theatrical and inert.
Peter Clarke’s thick pastes and
sanded textures can look inert, but on
this occasion his Castille Suite gains a
new life by being ten paintings so
subtly combined that it is one of the
most authoritative works on show.
Louis James, who won the $l5OO
Georges Prize, had a most beautiful
grey-and-black, post-cubist drawing-
painting of unequalled cohesion,
subtlety, and unassertive strength. His
large oil Event in Godzone, where
lightly painted and light-hearted people
rush to a black hell called Kings
Cross, is not so successful when his
didacticism becomes overemphatic
with symbols of degradation. The sec-
ond prize of $4OO went to Charles
Blackman, whose large drawing of a
monumental group by the curling sea
is deeply felt, but the idea in his
painting where pale silhouettes of
figures, ghosts of their former enthusi-
asm, seem to long for a life associated
with the entrancing blue rowing-boat
that floats, filling the bottom of the
work is incompletely expressed.
Melbourne viewers could enlarge this
splendid microcosm by visiting the
Contemporary Art Society’s interstate
show, where there are a few gro-
tesqueries, and some overlooked artists
like William Ferguson, who has a
magisterial, clotted and blooded work,
and Alan Leach-Jones, whose four
circles look like blown-up microscopic
slides. The prizewinner, Salkauskas’
Festive Landscape, seemed a little indo-
lent and funereal beside these, and Ron
Greenaway’s Indian festival, Kewley’s
Cobra celebration, Erica McGilchrist’s
floating, overlapping figures in a
Bunch of Nonsense, and Patsy Foard’s
open, loose-formed abstraction.
There was, in the younger painters,
a cautiousness not found at Georges,
and perhaps the Funk Event scheduled
for June 5 at the Argus may show that
he who hesitates may be lost.

His judgement is respected
all over the world: so are
his Parini suits
So many prominent people prefer Parini suits that
their reasons are worth exploring. First, there is the
purely personal reason of wanting to look one’s best.
Parini achieves this with dignity. Then —in such
people there is an inborn passion for quality, for skills
par excellent. Parini is generous in these things, too.
Finally, there is that urge for a little luxury . . . well-

Television
McGooley revisited
By FRANK ROBERTS
My Name’s McGooley, What’s Yours?
Channel 7.
ON “McGOOLEY” night last week I
revisited the show and found it good.
This is pleasant to report, as it had
been a poor show at the beginning of
the year, in my opinion, suffering from
anaemic plots and too much Gordon
Chater. It seemed to me, then, that
the writer-producer, Ralph Peterson,
had created two potentially strong
characters in McGooley’s daughter
and son-in-law, Rita and Wally Stiller
(Judi Farr and John Meillon), but felt
compelled to hold them in leash because
the show was named “My Name’s Mc-
Gooley, What’s Yours?” This was the
reverse of a situation which occurred
many years ago in an Australian comic
strip, “Wally and the Major,” in which
the principals became subsidiary to a
side character named “Pudden.”
Just as Stan Cross had to let his strip
be taken over by his more outrageous,
and, therefore, funnier character, so
Peterson had to decide whether or not
to let affection take its course and his
Wally become the main attraction of
the show. He has done this cleverly,
leaving McGooley still the mainstay,
the wily manipulating character on
whom the action turns but it now
turns Wally’s way, or did last week.
Meanwhile, of course, John Meillon has
been ill, and it will be interesting to
see how the show stands up during
episodes when he will have to be written
out.
Last week’s “McGooley” may have
been an exception, but at this stage in
local TV production all I ask for is
the exception. Creating one fair-to-
average plot each week, with even an
occasional outstanding one, over nine
months of the year, is a staggering task
for one man. The “McGooley” plot
was simple and uncluttered. Wal
decided on an economy campaign,
McGooley conjured an old suitor of
Rita’s into existence, Wally’s sister
(Noeline Brown) bought her a new
dress and a dark wig for his expected
visit, someone suggested champagne,
Wally almost had a fit.
McGooley slipped out and read a
supposed cancelling telegram to the
Stiller household, and, finally, flowers
for Rita arrived sent by Wally,
allowing the episode to close on a nice
note of pathos, well acted by the two
(now) principals, Rita and Wally. It
was good, rounded television humor,
and I found it, surprisingly, even better
than the same night’s “Hugh and I,”
the British TV humor show written by
John Chapman and based on the same
soft-hard character contrasts.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Round and round the taxing bush
NOW THAT THE absurd Post Office charges have been
defeated in the Senate, the Government has to work out how
to raise enough money to get by on. It has several choices:
Increase other taxes; cut down its own spending, or stimu-
late the general level of economic activity so that higher
profits and incomes automatically bring in higher tax
revenues.
The real answer to the problem lies in the second two, but,
unfortunately, the Government is certain to concentrate its
thinking powers on the first. So the taxpayer’s escape from
the talons of the PMG (who planned to mangle the public
even more violently than his letter-sorting machines handle
the mails) will probably mean simply that the taxpayer will
be hit equally hard but in another way in August’s Budget.
Yet there is no point at all in protesting about this, when it
happens, simply because it will take money out of taxpayers’
pockets.
Too many critics want to have their cake and eat it;
anyone who complains about increased taxation or Govern-
ment charges is obliged by logic to suggest what else the
Government should do about it. Should it spend less on air-
ports, universities, social services, housing, be less generous
with the State Governments, or what? It is not easy to find
areas of Government spending where the knife can be
applied. The good Cladstonian, putting his eye over the
Budget, will justifiably be horrified at the $2OO million
which goes on simple handouts these days as subsidies, not
only to the much-lamented dairy farmers, but to fertiliser
users, shipbuilders, airlines, sugar producers, and tobacco
farmers. There are excellent economic arguments for heavy
cuts here, but it must he admitted that any scheme for
pruning these uneconomic industries and relocating their
resources would involve, for some years at least, heavy
expenditure on adjustment assistance. So it would not be
any immediate relief for the Budget, even if it would save
the taxpayers of the ’seventies some money and cut some
dead wood out of the national economy.
Increased efficiency in Government is the usual answer
of critics of the level of Government spending. Usually, they
do not get very far, however, because they do not spell out
specifically how this might be achieved. And it is not easy
to find ways, although there are certain lines of reform
which could be profitably pursued. First, if the Government
is determined to make service departments like the Post
Office pay their way, they should be withdrawn from the
bureaucratic controls of the Public Service Board and estab-
lished as statutory authorities, with autonomy in hiring and
firing procedure and. charging. The Post Office is so huge
MEN AND MATTERS
ONE OF THE hardest things to do
in Sydney recently has been to try to
book the best suites in any of the lead-
ing hotels. For there has been a re-
markable procession of international
big nobs coming here (often to see
how we have managed to do so well
without the benefit of their capital
inflow). What with tecent visits of
a group of the world’s top central
bankers, a massive gathering of inter-
national business talent at the Stanford
seminar, the international conference
of scientific management, and the usual
flow of big wheeler-dealers from the
U.S., all the talk in recent times about
the threatened surfeit of high-class hotel
accommodation after the Wentworth
opened seems a bit unreal; there is a
shortage.
Latest of the big leaguers to visit
Australia is Lord Coleraine, one of the
top men from the Pru, out here to
confer with local executives of the
Prudential Assurance Company before
they pull down their big and fairly
modern Martin Place headquarters to
put up a much bigger and much more
modern Australian HQ.
A former journalist (what an im-
pressive list of former journalists there
ls! ), 66-year-old Lord Coleraine is the
younger son of Andrew Bonar Law,
the short-time British Prime Minister
°f 1922-23 (whose abilities have been
reassessed upwards in recent histories).
Lord Coleraine spent 23 years as a
Conservative MP before his elevation
to the peerage in 1954, holding minis-
terial posts in the war-time Govern-
ment and being appointed a Privy
Councillor in 1943.
IF MAN HAS become the victim of
his technology, Charles E. Silberman,
the U.S. economic journalist who sug-
gested it to the Congress of Human
Relations in Melbourne last week,
would seem to have escaped that fate.
A man in the Galbraith mould, he is
as much at home articulating on auto-
mation, economic, race, and religious
questions as he is writing about them
for “Fortune” magazine (he is on its
board of editors) and in his well-known
books.
He started life in the mid-west
(1925), but he is really a product of
New York’s schools and universities,
with the U.S. Navy thrown in for good
measure. In the past decade he has been
dividing his energies mostly between
his job on “Fortune” (which he joined
in 1953) and part-time lecturing at
Columbia University, where he gradu-
ated after his naval service. Now on
leave from “Fortune,” he’s engaged as
director of the Carnegie Corporation
project studying the “education of
educators.”
C. E. Silberman
Lord Coleraine
AT A TIME when the Government is
trying to attract increasing numbers of
men with business experience into its
service, yet another leading public ser-
vant is moving out to private industry.
G. Paul Phillips, the'4B-year-old Deputy
Secretary of the Department of Trade
(number four in the department’s
hierarchy and a top man in inter-
national commodity negotiations), is
leaving to be the first executive director
of the newly formed Australian Mining
Industry Council at a salary which is
understood to be not so very much
larger than the $12,605 he gets now.
A Fort Street boy who did agricul-
tural science at Sydney University, he
joined the Air Force after graduating
in 1941, and by the end of
when he entered the public service, he
was a squadron-leader.


that the mail services might well be separated off from the
telecommunications set-up (as in the U.S.A.) and two
statutory corporations created in place of the one P.M.G.
department.
There is also great scope for rationalisation of affairs in
Canberra. It is ridiculous that there should be five military
departments, each with its own training, research, stores,
personnel, computing, and other establishments. The
Canadians have shown that there are great savings to be
had in service integration. And the other departments are a
haphazard hotchpotch of functions. Many do not need full
ministerial status. Works, Territories, Customs and Excise,
Repatriation, and Health could well be brought within other
departments. Civil Aviation and Shipping and Transport
should be combined into a transport department. Trade and
Industry’s legendary spread could sensibly be contained by
taking off sections dealing with decentralisation, import
trends, and the like, and placing them within relevant
departments.
The whole approach to departmental budgeting needs to
he altered to take advantage of modern management
methods. The bureaucracy in Washington is currently switch-
ing to “program budgeting,” a sensible method of financial
control which does away with a lot of the waste of traditional
techniques. But there are no signs that this sort of thinking
has reached Canberra yet, and if it had it would take years
to make itself felt. To get the Government out of the red
is going to take higher tax revenues (either through higher
tax rates or increased returns from existing taxes if the
economy tempo increases). And as the Government itself is
the greatest single restraint on that tempo (fears of balance
of payment troubles ahead are very real in the corridors of
governmental power) it looks as if taxes may have to rise.
This means, in other words, that because the Government
has kept economic activity down, therefore its own taxes are
down, so therefore, in order to raise enough revenue it is
forced to increase taxes, which have the effect of reducing
economic activity, which . . .
Wincott astray
IT’S QUITE FUN when Mr. Harold Wincott aims a kick
at the bottoms of Australians who complain about foreign
capital—especially when it misses the mark by such a wide
margin as did his lengthy article in the London “Financial
Times” last week. But it is not so funny that sensible Aus-
tralian concern at the methods (rather than the volume) of
foreign investment here should be so (wilfully?) misunder-
stood. For Mr. Wincott and the “Financial Times” are
opinion-makers in Britain. And the Australian case against
foreign investment is worthy of a more reasonable
presentation.
More important, it is essential that British investors under-
stand the realities of the situation just in case (by some
chance) they are allowed to invest here again.
Mr. Wincott, who quite properly noted the “split mind”
Australia has about the extent and role of overseas capital,
sees it all in terms of those who want it here and those who
don’t. That is absurd. The division is more sensibly between
those who want it here in a completely free, unfettered way,
and those who want to impose various restraints on it. Apart
from a small idiot fringe, no one seriously suggests that we
could or should do without overseas capital.
It is offensive, for instance, to a great many Australians
who otherwise favor foreign investment here that foreign
companies should come here risking only small amounts of
equity capital but borrowing large amounts inside Australia
at a limited rate of return to the lender and in this way-
gearing up their profitability to fantastic heights.
Of course, Mr. Wincott has his usually excellent statement
of the facts of Australian capital imports, pointing out that
without these (and all other things being equal) we would
have been bankrupt over the past 17 or 18 years; that we
would have had to forgo a great many imports, or greatly
reduce immigration, or leave a great deal of industry and
natural resources undeveloped. But now let Mr. Wincott
discuss the more serious question of whether foreign capital
coming here should be subjected to any controls or whether
we should try not to be another Canada.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: The Reserve Bank observes
that the annual peak in bank and public holdings of
liquid assets was passed in March, and the subsequent
downswing is now. well under way. The community is
“reasonably well placed” to cope, the bank opines.
Listed companies raised a total $190.7m. in fixed
interest securities during 1966, well ahead of 1965’s
$143.5m.; equity raisings, at $140.8m., were below the
$170.3m. for 1965.
For the markets: Despite their moderate index
advance (spread over most sections) industrials on
Australian share markets can’t be described as very
certain; metals are still making most of the play.
Poor foreign trade statistics pushed London down,
with leaders quite irregular . . . Blue chips were notice-
ably affected by Wall Street’s usual profit-taking.
For companies: You can’t keep a good takeover
down . . . After the novelty of suggesting that Davies
Coop directors find a buyer for the 4.1 million DC
shares now held by Viyella, the bidding Viyella Inter-
national put in a claim for any 1966-67 dividend
whether the holding is sold or not; it remains to add
that the DC board has accepted the selling challenge . . .
Industrial Equity has sent its offer for Stack and Co.
straight to shareholders; Stack’s riposte points out that
the GM-H franchise is in danger if Industrial Equity
wins . . . Nearly half of Golden Poultry Farming's
capital is held by Ingham-British Tobacco as a result of
buying on the market; GP reports 15 percent more sales
in nine months to March 25 and a loss of $107,708 . . .
Leather merchants Associated l eathers and J. Bayley
and Sons plan peaceably to merge (by medium of Asso-
ciated) to become Australia’s biggest hide and leather
group; capital will become $3,803,400.
BHP decided to take a 50 percent working partner-
ship with Esso Standard Oil in the Marlin offshore
field—the same as with Barracouta . . . Extension of
Queensland Alumina’s Gladstone refinery is to be
financed by a Euro-dollar loan as well as by funds from
one Australian and a group of U.S. banks . . . Mineral
sands sent Western Titanium’s profit up from $645,300
to $664,567, after initial tax of $164,904, on revenue of
$2,152,988 (previously $1,848,015) . . . Associated
Minerals has secured a 92 percent acceptance from
Wyong Minerals . . . Golden Plateau must pass its half-
yearly dividend because of higher costs; more gold was
recovered in the July-April period ... Tin and wolfram
miner North Australian Uranium has fixed a 10 percent
dividend rate by a second 2.5 cents a share payout.
Sugar looked much more promising when Bundaberg’s
Gibson and Howes changed 1965’s $257,480 loss into
1966’s $212,960 profit, mainly as a result of a bigger
output; the current crop has started well . . . Higher in
the tropics Burns Philp (South Seas) .moved earnings
up 16 percent to $497,493, at the same time talking
about “lack of buoyancy” around the islands.
Bonus prophets rejoiced as Tooth’s payout went from
15f .to percent; earnings climbed gently from
$4,885,121 to $4,918,952 following a first-half retreat . . •
Maltster Barrett Burston may move completely from
Melbourne to Sydney . . . On the solid side, George
Weston Foods expects to hold its improved percent
rate . . . Fulfilling rumors, confectioner Macßobertson
(Australia) had to pass the final dividend, leaving 4
percent for the full year; profit dropped back 29.4
percent to $273,699, giving a 5.7 percent earning rate.
The latest fixed-interest raisings by financiers Indus-
trial Acceptance Corporation and Finance Corporation
of Australia carry lower rates . . . The MLC Ltd. took
almost the same surplus from the life and industrial
branches to pay the unchanged 15 5-6 percent divi-
dend . . . The H. G. Palmer group produced a total
$2,771,562 of losses in the December half, to bring
present known losses to nearly s43m.

Season of mists...
Braving the economic forums
By CROESUS
FROM MY COUNT of heads, few
brave the full exercise these days, but
any businessmen who try to keep up
with all the economic chit-chat from
various Melbourne forums in the
autumn earn their headaches. If three
recent nights’ listening to the Economic
Society coming to masterly inconclu-
sions about where the economy ought
to be heading would seem ordeal
enough, with only a weekend’s respite
the roll of the economic faithful was
called at the Southern Cross Ballroom
for three full days’ attendance at an
international congress on human rela-
tions. Travelling hopefully through the
same mists, I spotted enough imponder-
ables to last me all winter.
The trouble with attending economic
forums is that you’re likely to finish
up seeing all the signals in a kaleido-
scope of various shades of green, amber,
and red beaming out at you at the
same time, and come away as confused
as ever. That was more or less the case
with this latest one. The measure of
disagreement about where the economy
is going, at what pace, and whether its
direction and pace are the best we can
manage was substantial and at times
absolute. A good example of this was
the polarisation of views on what might
be called buttoning up the system. At
the south pole we had Professor Hogan,
of Newcastle University, wanting
(naturally enough for a New Zea-
lander) to stiffen controls, even to im-
pose restrictions, and, at the north,
an uncompromising Mr. Newton want-
ing to clear the decks, including the
tariff, so that the market could get
signals from a freer play of competitive
forces.
Mr. Newton didn’t say in any detail
how far he would go in freeing the
economy. One gathered he would get
rid of most of the present subsidies
and cut back tariffs mercilessly. When
somebody expressed mild horror at such
affronts to our precious economic but-
tons, his appropriate answer was that
at the moment it was more a matter of
stopping the rot in the other direction.
Nobody seemed to disagree with him
on that, but on another night we had
Mr. D. J. Hjbberd, of CRA, put up a
case for giving subsidies in the shape
of double taxation allowances for
minerals exploration. Mr. Newton
wasn’t in attendance to sharp-shoot this
idea and it was left to Professor
Maureen Brunt, from Monash, to ex-
pose the limitations of the case and
charm its propounder to extinction.
As for the economy getting the right
signals, W. M. Cordin, of the ANU,
went more than halfway with Newton
m his desire to unbutton the economy.
Nor was he as uninhibited as some of
me speakers about the usefulness of
cost-benefit exercises in advancing a
better disposition of resources as ad-
juncts to a freer play of market forces.
Earlier we had heard Dr. Bell, of the
AMP, say the institutions found such
exercises of very limited value in
assessing lumpy investments in minerals
projects and even Professor Willett
seemed not all that impressed by their
results, or at any rate their acceptabi-
lity, in more run-of-the-mill business
assessments. For my part, since read-
ing Professor Matthews on the subject
in his recently published (Cheshire)
“Public Investment in Australia,” I’ve
been truly bitten by the cost-benefit
bug and found Cordin’s own avowal
of faith in it most heartening.
Cordin seems on the right track in
saying that, even if the results from
such exercises may suffer from the
limitations of the data available to be
put into them, this should not deter us
in running this sort of rule over all
the choices open to us for the use of
resources, be they for investment in
either public or private sector. He is
in good company there, because this
is also being more widely recognised
overseas, particularly in the United
States, where, as Professor Matthews
relates, applications of the technique
have been foreshadowed even for some
unlikely candidates in the sphere of
public investment. These include in-
vestment in social welfare and educa-
tion. Such exercises on them involve
using weights for national priorities for
alternative expenditures and also
national interest rates on the funds in-
volved. At the very worst, such exer-
cises are better than nothing and an
advance on the present rule-of-thumb
methods of determining funds alloca-
tions in the public sector.
Doubtless overseas corporations do
their own cost-benefit (as well as cash
flow) exercises in determining whether
and on what scale they operate and
invest funds here. It is just a thought,
but perhaps we would get a greater
Australian participation in our own
economic developments if more locals
did them, too. Anyway, hardly anybody
at the forum was intolerant of foreign
investment. The idea of foreigners
usurping our natural resources didn’t
seem to be worrying anybody very
much, except Professor Brunt. Even she
seemed more concerned to postulate
the criteria for examining the place of
foreign investment in various segments
of the economy than to condemn it out
of hand, except, say, in the shape of the
international mining segment, operating
as if it were a semi-independent layer
on the rest of the economy.
The latter possibility opens up some
big and not irrelevant questions in
relation to present minerals develop-
ment here. The forum didn’t pursue

time ago, with one of the biggest U.S.
metals magnates I got some very
oblique answers. For Mr. D. J. Hib-
berd’s part, the assumption of a separate
overseas-controlled layer of mining
activity not tied in with general Aus-
tralian economic development was ob-
viously unrealistic and contrary to the
facts. Anyway, there were safeguards to
ensure foreign operators didn’t act
against our national interests, he said,
explaining that, apart from formal
documentary ones giving Australian
directors the last word when national
interests were threatened, mining
investments in any country are the most
vulnerable of all for foreigners. That
is not quite what Professor Brunt was
getting at, by any means, and doesn’t
cover the whole story.
In another of its aspects, the effect of
foreign investment on the balance of
payments, the forum also stopped short
of a full expose, or so it seemed to me.
It was more prepared to go along with
Mr. Hibberd’s run-down of the benefits
minerals exports will confer on gross
exports than to recognise the net
balance of payments effects produced
by the outflow of rewards and the re-
patriation of capital.
Several of the speakers even thought
it astonishing that so much fuss has
been made about the stark (to me)
fact that the Australian share (if any)
of the equity of some of the biggest
industrial and mining groups in the
country is so small (in the case of
Comalco, for instance, of which Mr.
Hibberd is head, it is only percent,
not 50 as he inferred in his address).
Professor Willett thought it laughable
that at one time such an unlikely pair
as Messrs. Calwell and Ricketson were
both beefing loudly in the cause of get-
ting more Australian participation, and
he couldn’t see what the problem was.
Cordin said it was all looked after by
the Federal tax man, who had a big
Australian stake in the equity of every-
thing. Mr. Hibberd, an out-and-out
foreign capital man, conceded only that
if there was any problem about foreign
investment it could be about control,
and, as stated above, he thought that
side could be dismissed as being no
problem at all.
So, although the matter of locnl
equity participation got an airing, the
discussion on it was most unsatisfying'
Nobody drew the correct balance of
payments inferences from the outflow
of dividends on overseas-owned equity
or, for that matter, from the repatria-
tion of fixed-interest loans of the type
Mr. Hibberd had been getting from
U.S. institutions. It is a pity Professor
Wheelwright wasn’t there to round off
the argument and that somebody didnt
follow an obvious lead into the question
whether it is better to have foreign
finance coming in as fixed interest loans,
a la Comalco’s recent inflow, or as
equity capital. This, at least, would
have put Mr. Hibberd on the spot.

Good hopes for Ampol’s dividend
MINING • SHARE • LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON in Sydney
AMPOL HAS certainly been in the
news in the past few weeks. There was
the first shipment from the Barrow
Island oilfield, where Ampol has a
one-seventh stake (and a royalty), then
the 0.4 cents a gallon petrol price rise
for oil companies; then expectations of
a bullish interim report to come on
May 25; rumors of a takeover (no one
in the company knows anything about
them), and, to cap it all, some of the
Ampol board had an informal get-
together with some Sydney finance
journalists.
It all seems to point to a strong
suggestion that Ampol will be able to
hold its 10 percent dividend despite all
the ominous noises (made here, among
other places).
As was pointed out here last year,
Ampol will need to increase its pre-
tax profit by 60 percent or so (or $3.3
million on top of last year’s pre-tax
figure of $5.1 million) simply to meet
the 10 percent dividend on higher
capital, if the company continues to
pay tax at about 30 percent of pre-tax
profits.
But the indications are that Ampol’s
tax bill may be kept very low indeed;
the company’s method of financing its
oil search now that it has income arriv-
ing from Barrow is geared to the tax
advantages. As a result, its oil income
will arrive tax-free because of past
losses and Ampol will then use some of
this to subscribe more capital, which is
a total tax deduction.
True, the latest price rise will not be
as good as the company hoped (it asked
for 0.9 cents for standard and 0.6 cents
for premium), but it will add some-
thing. Ampol’s managing director is
reported as saying recently that an
Speculator’s Diary this week appears
on page 12.
extra 1 cent on to the price would have
brought in an extra $1 million net profit
(although it would have added about
$3.8 million to revenue). So a 0.4 cents
addition would probably add about
$350,000 to $400,000 to Ampol’s net.
This month’s interim report is fairly
widely expected to show that the Lytton
refinery, which took longer to over-
come some teething troubles, will at
last be contributing to the group’s profit.
On top of that, the rate of increase in
petrol consumption, which levelled off
last year, is back to its old rate of 71-
percent.
In any event, the market, which’ had
jumped 12 cents in recent weeks from
59 to 71 cents, dropped back a bit last
week when the petrol price rise was
announced. At this price it yields 7.2
percent on its 10 percent dividend—if
it can hold it. Indications are that it
probably will and that current prices
may eventually look a bit low. But the
battle is far from finally over. Ampol is
not a stock for nervous holders.
FOILED IN the margarine business,
Marrickville Holdings’ Mrs. Jones may
next cause a flutter in the chicken coops.
F. Crago, the flourmilling and stock
feeds subsidiary, is reported to be tak-
ing up interests in a couple of Sydney
poultry processors and in a poultry
breeding firm. This will not only assure
markets for the feed mill, but give
Marrickville valuable diversification.
Of course, Mrs. Jones is only treading
the path of Queensland margarine
maker Provincial Traders, whose Dixie
chicken may be the biggest single selling
label in Australia.
ONE INTRIGUING assumption by
the directors of Stack and Co., that un-
impressive distributor of GM-H pro-
ducts, in the current takeover battle
with the Brierley group’s Industrial
Equity Ltd., is that since GM-H has
stated it would remove the franchise if
the takeover went through, “the only
proper course then available to Indus-
trial Equity would be to liquidate the
company,” so that Industrial Equity
would make a “handsome profit” at the
expense of any shareholder who
accepted the offer.
But without going into the merits of
the offer (33 cents a share for no more
than 60 percent of the capital of the
company, whose assets backing is 61
cents a share) it seems worth recog-
nising that there is more than one
motor vehicle manufacturer in Aus-
tralia, and that some large GM-H dis-
tributors around Australia have found
it worth their while to give up that
business and switch to Ford. A motor
vehicle distributorship is as useful to
one maker as to another.
Frankly, this is one takeover where
neither side deserves to win.
The Chartist says:
ALBERT G. SIMS LTD. is one industrial stock which managed to move against
the general trend of the market since 1964, but is now showing “bearish” tendencies.
The strong downward trend in force from 1960 until 1963 was followed by a 50
percent uptrend for over two years until the break late in 1965. Although prices
did manage to rise to a higher level about the middle of 1966, it seems unlikely
that they will move back to the 1960 peak. This stock should be closely watched
by investors, as sales below 60c would indicate that a decline to approximately
the 40c level would be a possibility. Last sale price on 9/5/67 —67 c.

Behind the balance sheets
Humes stops its
mistakes
IT IS NOT what the company is doing
but what it has stopped doing that
makes Humes Ltd. such an interesting
proposition at present. Certainly, a
large profit rise and most probably a
lift in dividend will follow from the
fact that Humes has stopped making
such large losses on things that were
not really within the scope of the
company’s basic skills —making cement
and steel pipes. It dropped $550,000
on the disastrous Wunderlich-Humes
operation; it lost $368,355 last year on
a Murray River penstock contract; it
went down $90,000 on its Martin Stone-
ware subsidiary, and its new 50 percent
owned PVC piping associate, Hume-
S-Lon, suffered a “small loss” last year.
But it is no longer suffering from
the Wunderlich affair, its losses are
mainly over on the Murray River pen-
stock job, it is unlikely to lose much
more at Martins, and although there
was an ominous silence from the com-
pany about Hume-S-Lon in the recent
interim report, it does not have very
great scope for disaster even if the
company continues to have difficulty
convincing various Water Boards that
its kind of piping can stand up to
stresses.
So a large part of the company’s
remarkable net profit rise of 62 per-
cent in the latest half year (or 47
percent before tax) is due to the fact
that the profits on making pipes have
not been dissipated on other things.
The recovery is entirely due to the
parent company’s trading activities,
profits from which rose, according to
the latest interim report, by $834,000,
or by almost 160 percent. And as the
group trading profit rose by only
$799,000, it is clear that the rest of
the group’s trading activities brought
in slightly less in profits. All this was
on a sales increase of only 4 percent
from the group (and 6 percent—or al-
most all of the group rise of $1.4
million to $33.8 million from the
parent).
Although they show the right trend,
these magnitudes of profit rises are
quite unreal; if unusual items are ex-
cluded (particularly such matters as
the removal of provisions for contract
losses one year and adding back half
of them in the next), then it seems
more realistic to reduce the parent
company trading profit rise to about
70 percent (or about $550,000) and
the group’s trading profit rise to about
28' percent (or $534,000, which is still
below the parent company’s rise). This
sort of adjustment brings out a group
net profit rise of only 18 percent (and
a parent company lift of 8 percent),
but this, too, is clearly unreal in the
context of a 40 percent ($318,000)

rise in the group tax provision and a
95 percent jump ($376,000) in parent
company tax. What all this shows is
that this year’s net profit rise is not
as big as it looks, only because last
year’s figures were really far better
than the company (and the stock-
market) thought.
The important thing is that the
latest half-year’s accounts show the
company’s pre-tax profit to sales ratio
is back up at about 7.2 percent, which
brings it into line with the ratio in
1964, when earning rate was up at
23.8 percent and dividend was at 14
percent. Two years ago the 14 percent
dividend was trimmed to 12i percent
after a one-for-four issue at 50 percent
premium, with the explanation that
the fundi were being used for capital
works not fully productive immediately.
At the same time, said directors,
increased sales called for a substantial
increase in working capital. Neither
of these conditions now apply, and the
company’s profits are now back to their
old level, so it is time the dividend
moved likewise.
Capital expenditure is slowing down.
The sl.7m. spent in the first half of
the current year compares with $3.84m.
spent in the past full year. This has
tax implications, as investment in manu-
facturing plant gave special investment
allowance of $134,000 in 1965-66. Tax
relief from this source will not be so
great this year, but will still be signifi-
cant. And in the Far East qualification
as a pioneer company by allowing local
participation in the Malaysian company
since August, 1963, has reduced tax
provisions to 21 percent and 16 percent
in 1965 and 1966 respectively, com-
pared with 42 percent and 44 percent
in the two preceding years.
Over the five-year period of our
table, profit before tax rose by 25 per-
cent in Australia, 24 percent in New
Zealand, and 57 percent in the Far
East. After-tax profit rose 40 percent
in Australia, 40 percent in N.Z., and
92 percent in Singapore and Malaysia.
But despite tax relief in later years for
such reasons as new plant expenditure,
tax is high in relation to profits. For
instance, in Australia, tax provided in
1966 was 49 cents in the $, compared
with 42c to 53c in the four prior years.
And in the latest half year profit looks
very much on the conservative side; the
group tax provision of $l.l million is at
the rate of 45 cents to the $1 of pre-
tax trading profit, despite considerable
capital expenditure that would have
brought some tax relief.
The brighter results recently
announced are due in part to extra-
ordinary items. In the first half of 1965-
66, contract losses of $200,000 were pro-
vided for on a Snowy Mountains job
and note issue expenses of $76,000 were
written off. In the latest period to
December, 1966, half that provision
for contract losses was written back,

In reviewing 1965-66 operations,
directors were fairly gloomy about the
parent company’s prospects, with indi-
cations of little or no growth in demand
for pipes (Humes’ most important
product) in the next 12 months. But
with three and a half months to run,
directors in their interim report pre-
dicted a substantial improvement in
profits for 1966-67, due to the improved
performance of the parent company,
which is returning to trading levels of
three years ago. This half-year im-
provement has still not brought the
parent company’s profitability up to
the level of its subsidiaries, as the
parent provided 60 percent of the
group’s sales but only 55 percent of its
profit.
In 1965-66, Singapore and Malaysia
contributed $509,000 and N.Z. $350,000
(both records) to the group’s post-tax
profit, applicable to Humes, of
$2,095,244. Thus overseas operations
contributed 41 percent of group profit,
although dividends from them con-
tributed only one-fifth of the dividend
paid by Humes. But their contribution
may well ease back this year due to
difficult trading conditions in the
second half of the year following a
generally satisfactory first half.
Raising s2m. in notes at the end of
1965, bringing notes borrowing to
$5.6m., gave the company a stronger
current ratio in the last published
accounts, as at June 30, 1966. It is
company policy to provide productive
capacity in advance of demand, and
current capital expenditure is being
made on additional concrete pipe-
making plant at Darwin and new steel
pipe plant in Melbourne. The biggest
growth potential on Humes’ horizon
is in the provision of pipes to transport
oil and gas from the Esso-BHP Bass
Strait discoveries.
This year’s expected improvement
in dividend will lift the dividend vie
on Humes from 4.1 percent to 4.7 per-
cent at current prices, and should
restore its dented status as a growth
stock. Prices should recover to the
$3.50 level later this year.

Profit from the cheap ones
By PELIAS in Melbourne
THE BIGGEST PROFITS come from
the cheapest stocks; it only takes a 10
cent rise on a share at around the 50
cent mark to bring in a 20 percent
profit (BHP would have to rise by
$1.40 to bring in the same sort of
profits). So there is real money to be
made by looking at the lower-priced
sections of the market provided the
stocks selected are those with reason-
able chances of doing better and with
minimal “downside” risks.
The best time to buy these stocks
is when they have been out of favor
but look as if they are on the way
back in again. Motor Spares currently
fits into this category. Last week the
shares appeared to have bottomed out
at 31 cents and a degree of buying
interest took them to 33 cents where
they look good, presuming a reaction
has finally come to a drift which has
afflicted them since last December when
buyers were paying par.
What really knocked the price was
the March interim report. It revealed
lower sales and profits for the Decem-
ber six months and directors deferred
interim dividend until results for the
full year become available. In 1965-66,
total dividend was cut from 10 to
eight percent after a slip in earning
rate from 14.8 to 9.9 percent. At 33
cents, the market seems to be expect-
ing no dividend at all this year; this
is being a little too pessimistic.
The company’s sales (and probably
profits) were well above previous
figures in January and February, fol-
lowing the recovery in the industry. As
this recovery looks like lasting all the
way to June 30, final-half profits of
the group should get a decent sort of
boost, maybe even enough to make up
the ground lost in the first half.
If this proves to be the case, there
may even be another eight percent divi-
dend. This would return more than
12 percent from the current market
price and warrant a return to par. On
the other hand, if the recovery does
not make up all the lost ground, a fair
sort of payout to expect may be around
five percent. This would yield 1\
percent from the current market price
and warrant a lift to above 40 cents.
Whatever happens, it is a fairly safe
bet that the recovery in the industry
m the current six months will enable
the group to pay some sort of dividend
and this should result in some sort of
a rise in market price.
THE INCREDIBLE recovery staged by
the retail appliance and music group
Brash Holdings in the December six
months indicates that a parcel of shares
would not be a brash buy, especially as
the market has apparently failed to
recognise the changed situation and
left the $1 units at 70 cents. Perhaps
part of the reason for this is the
market’s incredulity about the profit
jump from $Bl7B to $79,299 in the
December half, especially since the full
1965-66 profit was only $56,508. Admit-
tedly, part of the profit jump reflected
a heavy tax cut from $13,110 to $l3OO.
But even if tax were steady, profit
would have jumped by $60,000. The
situation is similar to that of Brown &
Dureau, pointed out in this column
earlier in the year. That is not to sug-
gest that Brash will also get a takeover
offer; who needs it when the market
situation alone offers the prospect of
a sizable capital profit in the next
few months?
At 70 cents, the shares are yielding
more than seven percent from the
1965-66 five percent dividend rate. As
the interim payout was raised from
to three percent, a dividend of at
least six percent can be expected this
year providing a yield of 8J percent.
However, it seems probable that dir-
ectors will return dividends to their old
eight percent rate now that earnings
have recovered so strongly. The last
eight percent payout was in 1964-65,
when the full $87,342 profit returned
11.6 percent on capital.
Brash’s recovery is explicable, how-
ever. In 1965-66, the company was
severely affected by the chaotic con-
ditions in the electrical appliance field.
Since then, directors have taken strong
action to reorganise trading on a basis
which would cut costs and improve
margins in the appliance and television
divisions, but keep a steady flow of
returns from the profitable musical in-
strument and records divisions. Their
plan has obviously succeeded.
So the profit recovery has been a
genuine one in that it has stemmed
basically from trading. On this basis,
the market must return the shares to
at least par in the near future. To go
any higher they will probably require
a restoration of dividends to eight per-
cent, and this does seem possible* As
long as the scrip remains below par, it
must also be remembered that, like
Brown & Dureau, takeover is worthy
of consideration, particularly for a
company with net tangible assets of
$1.60 backing every $1 share.
THE DISMAL performance of Easy-
wear since listing in 1964 has done
nothing to inspire confidence in the
company or its shares. Hence, the 50-
cent units of this plastic rainwear, foot-
wear, and rubber manufacturer are

selling for a mere 44 cents, even though
last year’s earning rate jumped from
6.8 to 15.7 percent and dividend was
raised from three to eight percent. In
the latest December six months a “sub-
stantially” higher profit was reported
and interim dividend raised from three
to five percent. As last year’s final was
five percent, this put the group on a
10 percent annual rate, providing a
dividend yield of more than 11 percent
from the current market price.
The past history of the group suggests
that the stock should only be one for
speculators. However, last year’s earn-
ing rate and the big improvement of
the latest half indicate that dividend
should be at least a well-covered 10
percent this year. The fact that the
group is now assessed as a public com-
pany for tax, purposes might help
things, too. If profit for the year is
well up and confirms the trends
revealed by the interim report, the
market might at last get a little con-
fidence in the shares and take them
to a more worthwhile level (for those
who decide to buy at the current level,
that is). The chances for capital gain
are high and so are the risks; but they
appear worth taking.
NOW THAT THE 50c shares have
come back to par, small-time hardware
merchant and building industry sup-
plier Bunny Industries Ltd. may be
worth considering. For income there is
a nine percent yield from the nine
percent dividend and the chances are
for a little capital growth in the short
term. It is a long time since the shares
have been at par; usually they move
in the 60 to 70 cent range. It is not
hard to see a return to these levels,
especially if the company announces a
steady profit for 1966-67.
The announcement of slightly lower
profits for the first half appears to be
the main reason behind the current
lack of buying support. However, last
year’s dividend will be paid this year
even if profits are a little lower the
1965-66 earning rate of 20.9 percent
gave a wide cover to the nine percent
payout. If profit comes out steady, and
there is every chance of this following
the upturn in building activity during
the March quarter, the shares should
move back to around 60 cents, leaving
capital profits for anyone buying at
the present level. The shares were
fetching round 75 cents early last year
after the 1964-65 earning rate and
peaked at more than 30 percent. It
would not take much extra business tn
lift them to this level again.

Mining
The background to Hill 50
THE MOUNT MAGNET goldfield,
300 miles north-west from Kalgoorlie,
has in years gone by had its own boom
as a goldmining centre, spawning com-
panies such as Eclipse, Hill 50 Central,
Hill 50 Consolidated, and many others,
most of which closed down long ago.
Hill 50 Gold Mine N.L. is still oper-
ating quite vigorously in the area;
indeed its prospects are perhaps better
at the present time than they have
been for some years. The market
appears to agree with this, as it has
priced the shares at over 50 cents after
letting them fall as low as 14 cents
in 1966.
Hill 50 has been operating for many
years; it commenced operations in 1937
and on its modest capital of $900,000
(in nine million ten-cent shares) it has
paid dividends totalling over slsm., the
best annual dividend being in 1956
when a total of 55 cents per share was
paid. Profit in 1963 was slightly more
than $1,200,000, but since that time
falling grades and lower production
have taken their toll and last year’s
profit was only $134,663 after receipt
of subsidy. However, dividend was still
paid, albeit at the much reduced figure
of one cent, against 3.33 cents last
year. This dividend hardly justifies the
current market buoyancy, which must
be due to speculative interest surround-
in the company’s chances of becoming
once again a very rewarding goldmine.
This prospect certainly bears investiga-
tion.
Developments at the mine over the
past couple of years have been quite
exciting. During 1965, directors decided
to continue the sinking of an explora-
tory winze (a shaft beginning under-
ground, e.g., joining two different levels
of a mine) below the 3010 ft. level of
the mine. The sinking of this winze
was to establish whether the rich ore
encountered between 800 ft. and 1000 ft.
was repeated at depth, as indicated by
geological interpretation.
Preparation and development of this
internal shaft continued during 1966,
but was suspended following discovery
of better ground in another area held
by the company which it was decided
to develop first. Instead of continuing
with the winze from the 3010 ft. level,
the company diamond-drilled the area
of interest and reported in December
fast year the results of two holes drilled,
these holes gave most encouraging
results; depressed at an angle of 65
degrees from the vertical, one drill
intersected 85 feet of ore averaging 7.5
wts. of gold per ton, while the other
intersected 82 feet of ore averaging 12.9
wts. per ton. These intersections
began only 40 feet below the 3010 ft.
evel and are in metallurgically favor-
? . e § r °und. The grade of the ore body
eing mined at present is 4.9 dwts. of
gold per ton, and the high values en-
countered by these holes led directors
to resume their plans for an explora-
tory winze, to go down 200 feet and
so enable more thorough examination
of the position.
The new ore discovered to date in
this development may prove to be only
a higher grade of the ore body worked
down to the 3010 ft. level but, should
it prove to be the beginning of a new
body of ore, the outlook for the com-
pany would be changed considerably. It
was from the mining of the ore body at
the 800-1000 ft. levels that the company
was able to pay dividends of 40 to 55
cents during the three years from 1955.
Incidentally, in 1965 the company pur-
chased equipment to service an internal
shaft down to the 3850 ft. level, so the
cost of proceeding with the exploratory
winze should be quite moderate.
The area which was sufficiently pro-
mising to cause the temporary sus-
pension of development work at the
main Hill 50 mine was the Morning
Star lease, over which the company
had acquired an option in 1963 which
it subsequently exercised in 1965. This
lease contained a mine which had
shown promising assays (about 10
dwt.) in holes drilled by an earlier
company, and Hill 50 reconditioned
workings down to the 700 ft. level in
order to evaluate these earlier drilling
results. In October last year, the com-
pany announced that it had intersected
an ore shoot from drilling at the 657 ft.
level and that the intersection corres-
ponded with surface drilling results of
a previous holder of the lease.
The grades encountered in these
intersections led the company to the
decision, referred to above, to develop
this mine in priority to the exploratory
winze at the main mine, and a new
main shaft was commenced at the
Morning Star mine to reach 1150 ft.
The company hopes to be operating
this mine at full production by Decem-
ber, 1969.
There is no doubt that the develop-
ment of the Morning Star mine will
prolong the company’s life in the face
of ever-increasing costs and a fixed
gold price, as well as the diminishing
grades being encountered in the main
mine. But on current information
available there does not appear to be
any justification for the recent sharp
rise in the price of the company’s
shares, as successful exploitation of this
new mine will add only a few cents to
earnings and will not provide any real
increment for a couple of years. On the
other hand, further encouraging results
from developments below the 3010 ft.
level of its main mine would provide
reasonable support for the current

Silver tales
THERE’S QUITE A lot of talk around
that silver may well become Aus-
tralia’s “next metal.” Whatever the
chances of new discoveries, and in the
midst of a fair measure of current
speculation, the metal’s good long-term
future must not be forgotten.
Certainly the American authorities
have clamped the price to a rigid
$U.5.1.29 an ounce, yet this could rise
to about $1.45 when the U.S. Treasurer
decides, or is forced, to stop sales. Ex-
pectations of an early arrival at that
position sent silver futures up between
40 and 60 points last week, with the
most prominent rises among the distant
deliveries now nine and ten cents
an ounce above the ruling spot price.
The Treasury price has been main-
tained since October, 1963. If prices
reach $1.45, the reserves in obsolete
U.S. coinage will be economically
usable. Some sources believe Treasury
stocks could be exhausted about two
years hence, or the price will rise, and
coins will be melted down. Speculation
is mainly directed to the time when
Treasury sales end and short supply
forces prices up on a free market.
An added stimulus stemmed from
a statement by the Treasury’s Assis-
tant Secretary, Robert Wallace, that
the department “may not feel obliged
to defend the current silver price after
Christmas.” He also suggested that
violent price swings might be pre-
vented by incremental increases.
Production of silver is largely tied to
other mining activity—the metal is pro-
duced commonly as a by-product of
lead, zinc, or copper operations.
Exploration for the metal has yielded
little success, though a price lift will
increase activity in this field and maki»
lower-grade deposits attractive. But the
situation remains interesting, and some
leading mining industry men believe
that silver could be a glamor metal in
the 19705. Australia is only a relatively
small producer of silver, but the local
output is concentrated in a few hands.
By far the largest is Mount Isa Mines,
with the various lead-zinc producers also
significant suppliers.

Security analysis
Henry Jones: between EEC
and a premium issue
UP TO MARCH 31, Henry Jones
(IXL) Limited shares had not sold
below $3.40 this year, yet at the time
of writing the last sale was $3.30, and
the shares were quoted $3.25 buyer,
$3 32 seller. It is possible that two
factors could have caused the recession
in the share price:
(a) The announcement that Great
Britain would again seek membership
of the European Economic Community.
(b) The announcement that the com-
pany would be making an issue to
shareholders at a 25 percent premium
next August.
Probably no other share has been
subjected to the speculation that Henry
Jones’ shares have been subjected to
over the past ten years or so. Those
who did not believe in taking any
notice of the facts or the rather more
mundane evidence that was available
were always ready to predict that a
very substantial bonus issue would be
made when Mr. Palfreyman retired.
They would also suggest that the
shares would reach $5 “one day,” be-
cause substantial “hidden reserves”
would come to light and show “how
rich in assets” the company really
was. Certainly the shares have come
close to $5, but in the past ten years
they have never reached that price.
The statistics since 1963 are as fol-
lows and it is quite correct to say that
“hidden reserves” had to be disclosed.
The figures have been “corrected” as
far as possible for the variations which
have occurred as a result of various
changes in accounting practice which
will be referred to later:

There are a number of factors which
make a year-by-year comparison of the
accounts a rather hazardous matter.
Firstly, until the 1963/4 year it would
appear that only dividends actually
received from overseas subsidiaries were
brought into the accounts in Australian
currency. All other profits and assets
w ere treated in the consolidated
accounts as though the unit of cur-
rency in the country concerned was at
par value with the Australian £. In a
note to the 1962 accounts, the directors
justify this action on the following
basis:
1. The currencies were at par when
the original investment was made.
2. The capital and retained earnings
were not available for return to Aus-
tralia but must remain invested in the
country of operation.
3. Even if they could be, remittance
would involve obtaining Exchange Con-
trol approval and perhaps some tax.
Two directors and the auditors state
that in their opinion the accounts are
drawn up so as to give a “true and
fair view.”
In the 1962 accounts, stocks are
said to be valued at “the lower of cost
or realisable value (being under cost).”
In the 1964 report, it was indicated
that the past basis for valuation was
not one that the taxation authorities
found acceptable and an amount in
excess of $2.6 million was required to
bring the opening stock value for the
year into line with that acceptable to
the tax authorities. This did not affect
the profits for the year, but a pre-
viously hidden reserve was brought to
light.
Whether there are any more such
reserves to be disclosed is difficult to
say, but net tangible asset backing per
share has reached $5.68, which is 72
percent greater than the current share
price.
Shareholders haven’t had very much
in the way of benefits from the com-
pany. The dividend rate was held at
10 percent from 1940 to 1965 inclusive,
and it must be admitted that the in-
crease in the dividend rate to 12 per-
cent in 1966 does represent a one-for-
five bonus issue. Four share issues to
shareholders have been made during
the same period one-for-five in 1950,
and one-for-six in 1953, 1958, and
1963. The issue was at par in each
case, so there was a fairly substantial
bonus content in every case. Even so,
growth in dividends per share resulting
from the bonus content of these issues
would not have exceeded 2 percent per
annum compound over the past ten
years (excluding 1966). It will, there-
fore, be interesting to see whether the
1966 increase was a “once-and-for-all”
affair or whether there will be more
such increases in the future.
On the basis of the present share
price, and it is very difficult to say
what will happen to the price in the
next three months prior to the opening
of the issue, it looks as though the new
issue will still have a bonus content of
about 8J percent, despite the premium.
The recent drop ir_ ihe price of Henry
Jones’ shares would seem to stem from
disappointment with the terms of the
new issue, and it does seem that the
market is no longer concerned with the
substantial assets of the company. If
it was, the shares would surely be
standing above the $5 level.
The effect upon Henry Jones should
Britain enter the Common Market must
be a matter of some conjecture. It is
likely that only recently has any guide
been given to the extent of the group’s
activities. Even now the Research and
Statistical Bureau of the Sydney Stock
Exchange describes Henry Jones (IXL)
Ltd. as “holding company of jam manu-
facturing and fruit canning companies
(IXL products).” In his address
to shareholders at the 1966 annual
meeting, the chairman listed the prin-
cipal activities of the company’s sub-
sidiaries as: jam manufacturing, fruit
canning, cool storing and freezing, fruit
and hop growing, sawmilling, flour-
milling, cattle and sheep farming,
export of fresh apples and pears, steve-
doring, road and water transport, in-
surance, merchandising and financing
of primary producers’ supplies, broad-
casting and television activity, special-
ised engineering, and carton manufac-
turing.
One suspects that many of the
activities listed are services to the more
basic activities of jam manufacturing,
fruit canning, and the exporting of
fruit. On the face of it, the extent to
which the group will be affected by
the Common Market entry will depend
on the proportion of the group’s total
sales of $4O million plus which would
have been made in the U.K. In the
same address, the chairman said, “Our
South African factories are maintaining
their turnover very well, a large portion
of which is in sales to United Kingdom
and Europe at satisfactory prices . . .”
As the overseas subsidiaries were making
a larger contribution to group profit
than the Australian ones when a dis-
section was last given, it seems that the
effect could be quite marked.
At this stage, it is not an accom-
plished fact and Great Britain may
again fail to be elected to the “Club.”
So far as can be judged, earnings
per share have been tending slightly
downward over the past four years. One
could hardly expect the new funds to
be raised by the August issue to earn
more than five percent, because this is
the present return on shareholders’
funds. After making adjustments for
the new issue, the shares at $3.30 are
selling at a dividend yield of just under
four percent and at nearly 12J times
earnings. Future prospects that can be
seen at the present time would justify
a price/eamings ratio of nearer to ten
and a dividend yield of not more than
five percent. It will be interesting to
see whether those long-time admirers
will he justified eventually in their firm
belief of great riches to come.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
It’s a relief, perhaps, to start with other than the two hardy
regulars. Anyhow, Conzinc Riotinto does claim some attention
since, after midweek reversals, the price showed a net 30 cents
advance to finish at $6.50. Prominent early, Broken Hill South
reached $2.9S by a 14 cent rise, while New Broken Hill gained
4 cents over the week to touch $4.94. Mount Isa eased 1 ceii
Back to the “pair.” Western Mining, $12.05, added another 3
cents; BHP closed 8 cents better at $7.14. Well to the forefrom
MLC jumped a whole 86 cents to hit $9.66. Macßobertsoi
actually crept up 2 cents to $1.32. APCM came back 12 cent

Here's
how
to
minimize
billing
staff
The Kienzle FA/36 Billing Unit, because of its electronic computation section, is able to reduce
the amount of staff and office machinery required for such operations as indexing, invoicing,
stock accounting, billing and is especially attractive when used for the preparation of payrolls.
The fully transistorized electronic feature offers the widest possible versatility and silent
operation coupled with the simplicity of operation by a conventional typewriter keyboard.
As the material is being typed on to the required forms or stationery, automatic computation
of all figures relevant to the entries is made and fed to the sole machine operator. This elimi-
nates the use of comptometrists on a number of jobs.
Stott & Underwood can offer a full advisory service on the use of these machines and employ
German factory-trained specialists for this purpose.
Contact us today—and learn of the advantages of introducing this Kienzle system.

of Proust’s writing in the light of his
search for a suitable theme for fictional
material he had long had in hand. To
put it a little more accurately, he
believed that Art was tremendously
important, and wanted this to be his
theme; what he probably looked for
was the reason for its importance. His
mind naturally pursued metaphysical
paths for the answer. An early mentor,
Alphonse Darlu, had preached that
apart from being poetic and moral, Art
should be metaphysical. And a few
years later the Symbolist movement in
French literature must also have influ-
enced him.
For years when he pondered on this
problem and on a theme for his novel,
the one novel he tried all his life to
write, Proust, like the hero of “Remem-
brance of Things Past,” found only a
“black cavity” gaping in his mind. It
was for this reason that something like
four versions of his novel were begun
before he finally embarked on the
definitive one. Moreover it was un-
doubtedly the discovery of a solution
and consequently of a theme that
enabled him between 1909 and 1913
to complete the novel —for the first
time.
What was the theme? Since only
the first of three volumes of the novel
he wrote in those years was ever
published, it is not possible to be sure.
The remaining sections of “Remem-
brance of Things Past” as we know
it may well have acquired a new
thematic emphasis, though this is
generally assumed not to be so. In
any case critics seem unable to even
agree on the theme of the latter
beyond the statement that it is the
story of how a small boy grew to be
a writer.
Thus Mile Bree glosses over the
srgnificance of the famous theory of
memory, a phenomenon
Troust had been trying to mould into
a metaphysical theme ever since the
time he wrote “Jean Santeuil.” As an
exposition of Proust’s thought, her book
] s at fault in not giving greater prom-
mence to this theory. However, if she
Meant to extract what is of enduring
value in Proust’s ideas, the omission
( s m °re than justified, for the theory
ls preposterous and better forgotten.
What she concentrates on is the
concept of an “inner reality” peculiar
to each individual; in other words, the
individual’s interpretation of external
reality. The greatest value of Art (and
this must have been Proust’s conclusion)
lies in the communication of this “inner
reality,” which might otherwise re-
main unknown. The duty of the artist
is to define and express, albeit un-
consciously, that reality.
Mile Bree puts all this lucidly and
forcefully. Wisely she avoids getting in-
volved in the metaphysical complica-
tions of the theme. (They are there
nonetheless, and she ought perhaps to
have indicated this. It would also have
been helpful to point out that in-
voluntary memory was the technique
used to define his “inner reality” by the
narrator of “Remembrance of Things
Past.”)
Since everyone has his own “inner
reality,” according to Proust everyone
is capable of being an artist, but through
“intellectual sloth” most of us fail to
be even aware of our own reality, let
alone translate it into art. “Every
artist,” Proust has beautifully summed
up, “seems to have come from an un-
known land which he has forgotten, a
native land, different from that of any
other artist.”
What of Proust’s own “native land”?
It is indeed an “enchanted realm,”
a world of exquisite, enamelled colors
and richly elaborate detail. Certain
sections of the book (Combray, Balbec,
Venice) stand out, as he intended, like
precious stones, set in the silver of more
analytic passages. Flowers abound
hawthorn, fuchsias, apple-blossom,
chrysanthemums, many more. On the
other hand, as Mile Bree points out,
the fauna, oddly enough, is almost non-
existent; animals and birds have been
excluded from this paradise, and only
a few traces remain, superimposed on
certain aspects of the human inhabi-
tants.
Proust’s landscapes are all urban. His
characters never wander far from town
or city. Streets are lovingly delineated,
from the narrow steeple-haunted lanes
of Combray to the great boulevards
of Paris, and the labyrinthine “calli”
of Venice. The sea is often just out of
sight, or else river or stream, whether
the foam-topped waves of Balbec
“plage” or the waterlily ponds of the
Guermante’s way.
Art is present, of course, very promin-
Marcel Proust
ently paintings, music, books, and
theatre; and artists form a large pro-
portion of the population. As for the
people themselves: they are as intang-
ible and changing as nature is constant.
With each appearance they are seen in
a new light, so that it seems impossible
to define them, to categorise their attri-
butes. One thing they nearly all share
though is ruthless self-interest, and most
totally lack insight. Among the most
memorable and enjoyable scenes in the
novel are the scenes of social satire, the
comedy of manners. In a series of
dinner-table conversations which form
a link through the novel, Proust subtly
and wittily exposes the vanity, the ignor-
ance, the stupidity of members of society
from the “bourgeoisie” to the “haute
aristocratic.” His satire is pointed but
not savage. On the whole, though he
had his moments of pessimism, Proust
was not, as is often idly supposed; a
misanthropist. Even when he is most
scathing one senses his fundamental
pity.
Proust’s humor, perhaps even more
than his poetic vision, is what one
values most in him, and those who in-
tend to make yet another attempt to
read his novel could do no better than
tackle these dinner-party scenes first,
and so convince themselves that there
is something in Proust they can enjoy.
It is heresy to say so these days, but I
find “Remembrance of Things Past”
eminently a book for browsing through.
The impact it might have made as a
whole on the ordinary reader was to
my mind dissipated in the hundreds of
extra pages Proust added to his original
three volumes.
So we come back to the question of
the novel’s genesis. As Mile Bree
rightly says, a knowledge of this is indis-
pensable to its proper enjoyment. One
also needs to know something of
Proust’s life. The reader who wants to


acquire this knowledge will find the
first part of the author’s book ideal.
Here is the most up to date and pene-
trating summary of Proust’s life and the
evolution of his novel. As it is in this
section also that she expounds the theme
of the novel as she sees it, “The World
of Marcel Proust” seems to me the best
all-round introduction to Proust avail-
able. About the second half of her book,
a critical discussion of some aspects of
“Remembrance of Things Past,” it is
not so easy to be enthusiastic. Her
earlier book, “Marcel Proust and De-
liverance from Time,” seems to me to
offer more insights.
“Laziness or doubt or impotence,”
wrote Proust, “takes refuge in the ques-
tion as to what form one’s art should
take. Should one write a novel? A
philosophical essay? Am I a novelist?
. . .” It seems incredible Proust could
have seriously asked himself the last
question, yet one must regret that his
answer to the first was a compromise.
What a pity he did not write an essay
on his aesthetic and psychological
theories, and separately illustrate them
in a novel, which would then have been
untrammelled with much of its present
philosophical content.
But one could muse endlessly on what
the novel might have been. The fact
remains that it is severely flawed due
to contingencies arising from its mode
of composition and publication, and to
inherent faults in Proust’s own make-up.
Paradoxically, while Proust is one of
the very greatest novelists, he has not
left us a really great novel. “Remem-
brance of Things Past” is for me like a
magnificent, half-ruined city, through
which one may wander time and time
again to one’s infinite reward, being
overwhelmed by this feature and that,
and passing regretfully by certain
others. To appreciate what were
Proust’s splendid, perhaps foolhardy,
intentions, one can only turn to the
commentators.
Cocktail chatter
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
Remembering Mr. Maugham. Garson
Kanin. Hamish Hamilton. $3.85.
THIS IS AN unutterably dreary book.
How such a ragbag of trivia, name-
dropping, fourth-rate cocktail party
anecdotage, and gorge-raising literary
obsequiousness ever saw the light of
publication is a mystery explicable only
on the grounds that anything, positively
anything, written about the late Wil-
liam Somerset Maugham is, for the
moment, anyway, a profitable book-
selling commodity. The Somerset
Maugham bandwagon is a surprising
and dispiriting phenomenon, and I
dare say we haven’t seen the last of it
yet. Perhaps one reason is the sheer
longevity of the subject. Maugham
lived so long that saurian-visaged
old thing living exquisitely among his
priceless paintings in the Villa Maures-
que seemed almost indestructible—that
material about him went on banking
up for years, awaiting the moment
when he was safely tucked away at
last and the memoirists could rush to
their waiting typewriters.
Somerset Maugham was often cruel
to his admiring friends. Well, some
of them are having a terrible revenge
now. What a licking of chops, what
eructations of pent-up malice, what a
torrent of reminiscence—adulatory, ad-
monitory, scabrous, or merely dull—
has signalised all the peeping and
botanising about the old man’s grave!
Maugham himself always insisted that
he didn’t want a biographer and that
he wished to be judged by his work
alone. When that time comes he will
be recognised for what he was —not
one of the great figures of English
literature (his human sympathies were
too cold and atrophied for that) but
an honest craftsman who found writing
“damned hard work,” a perfectionist
within the narrow confines he set him-
self, and one of the few English masters
of those intractably un-English literary
forms, the novella, and short story.
Meanwhile, the petty Saint-Simons
of the court of the Villa Mauresque
scribble industriously away, the band-
wagon rolls on, and the latest to climb
on board with more delectable morsels
to feed our (presumed) insatiable
curiosity about Willie Maugham, warts
and all, is Garson Kanin, an American
dramatist, novelist, and film writer.
Kanin and his wife, the actress Ruth
Gordon, were friends of Maugham’s
during the last 20 years of his life, and
came to know him as well as anyone
really knew the man inside the smooth
crustacean shell of Maugham’s outward
personality.
After each meeting Kanin jotted
down his recollections in a diary, and
this book is made up of extracts from
the diary with later comments
appended. It is plain that Kanin
admired Maugham this side of idolatry
and was highly flattered by the fact
that he was admitted to the select
circle of people Maugham tolerated.
Reading between the lines, it is equally
plain that Maughan was frequently
irritated, offended, or simply bored by
his admirer’s cross-examinations and
attempts to extract literary obiter dicta
from his casual remarks. One suspects
that Ruth Gordon’s company was what
Maugham chiefly desired.
Typical of Kanin’s remorseless spate
of trivialities is the following: “1951.
St. Jean-Cap Ferrat. I ask him today
if, in his work as a writer, he followed
any rule or principle with regard to
cutting. ‘Yes,’ he replies without delay.
‘lf it occurs to me to cut something I
cut it.’”
Behind this banality, reported with
perfect seriousness, you can hear the
weary disdain in the master’s voice.
There is a lot of this preposterous
rubbish. It reads like a gruesome parody
of Boswell on Dr. Johnson, without the
rough edge of the Great Lexicographer’s
tongue to give it salt and savor. “P our
Mr. Kanin another drink, Alan,” says
Willie, and up pops the indispens-
able Alan Searle to guard his master
from further wearying questions.
A few illuminating or entertaining
scraps of information lie scattered over
the desert of trivia. Maugham’s literary
models: Fielding, Dickens, Hazlitt, and
(an odd pair indeed) Cardinal Newman
and Trollope. His opinion of his
brother, Lord Maugham, Lord Chan-
cellor of England: “I have met a good
many odious men in the course of my
seemingly endless life, but never one
more odious than my brother.” His
passion for physical fitness, his financial
canniness, his fastidiously organised
household, the uncanny flair with which
he built up one of the most magnifi-
cent private art collections in the
world, and, of course, the much-
publicised, almost lunatic hatred of his
wife and daughter that embittered his
last years.
Kanin’s best anecdote concerns
Maugham and the celebrated lion-
hunting hostess Lady Cunard. After
dinner one night Maugham abruptly
announced that he had to leave.
“Lady Cunard protested. Maugham
said, ‘I must get to bed if I want to
keep my youth.’ Lady Cunard said, ‘Oh,
but why didn’t you bring him with
you? We would have loved having
him!’ ”
Alexandrines
By JOHN BAXTER
A Conspiracy of Women. Aubrey
Menen. Hamish Hamilton. $2.65.
AUBREY MENEN, in his latest novel,
tries to see the funny side of Alexander
the Great, a figure not noted for his
humor, nor offering, one would have
thought, much opportunity for jokes.
In the end, the writer fails in his
attempt to discover the essential
comedy of world conquest, sack,
slavery, and rape—but only by a
whisker. What success he does have
is owed to the book’s subsidiary theme,
the intransigence of the female sex.
“A Conspiracy of Women” deals
mainly with the background of a
single Alexandrian action, the poli-
tical marriage of some hundreds of his
officers to Persian noblewomen in order
to consolidate his conquest of the
country before moving on to India,
and the disturbances which this appar-
ently simple plan set up. Domestic
fury and military disobedience follow
in its wake, with the result that the
army’s efforts are severely hampered
and its officers drained of their resolve.


When the invasion of India fails, one
; s left with the impression that all
might have gone well had Alexander
ot been so foolish as to marry his
men off, not so much against their
wishes as against those of their
mistresses.
This misogynistic theme is presaged
by the book’s first lines, an exchange
to which Menen, in a brief introduction,
draws the attention of his readers. “One
day, when Alexander the Great was
sitting in his tent, he said to his friend
Hephaestion, ‘Hephaestion, have you
ever thought about the fact that
women make up half the human race?’
‘Once,’ said Hephaestion. ‘And what
did you think about it?’ said Alex-
ander. ‘I thought it was a pity,’ said
Hephaestion.” In these seven lines,
Menen states, resides the essential
point of the book. It is perhaps a
slim column on which to erect such an
edifice as this, but the author is a
practised architect and the structure
seldom trembles.
If the basic premise is not especially
rich in comedy, there is plenty of
incidental humor in some of the de-
scription. The sack of a Persian town,
during which the Greek Army, long-
inured to the dubious delights of
sexual despolation, ignores the lures
of rape for the more negotiable rewards
of booty, is nicely described. “Many a
woman cowering in a corner, awaiting
a carnal assault,” Menen remarks, “was
surprised to be asked politely by the
invading soldiery where the family plate
was kept.” There is a similarly amus-
ing finale to this scene, in which the
poetic Bathyllus, first of many Greek
men to be reduced during the course
of the novel to puling bewilderment
by women, finds himself involved, at
the height of the pillage, in a reciprocal
verse-reading with the lady he has
carried off.
The destruction by women, both
Persian and Greek, of man’s resolve
and reason accelerates after this brief
appetiser. When Alexander announces
his plan to marry his officers and
generals to high-born Persian ladies, a
chancy and difficult plan suggested to
him, naturally enough, by a woman, the
Greek camp-followers revolt and form
a sorority, the Daughters of Macedon,
devoted to stamping out such heathen
practices as mixed marriages. The
issue is further complicated when the
Persian women set up a temple to the
goddess Anaitis, and announce their
intention to install in it a priestess/
prostitute of the type found in all
temples of their persuasion. The
Daughters of Macedon are outraged,
there is a fight, and the temple is
destroyed. In the middle of this,
Alexander and his men, busily trying
to win a war, appear as little better
than children, the creatures of their
squabbling wives and concubines.
It would be doing a severe injustice
to Mr. Menen’s sharp and penetrating
w it to characterise all of “A Conspiracy
Alexander the Great
of Women” as merely amusing. As is
unfortunately not the case with most
modern humorists, Menen writes for
blood. Earlier books, especially his
acid first novel, “The Prevalence of
Witches,” have indicated a disinclina-
tion merely to play with themes.
Though his style, in this case at least,
is Wodehousian, the precise and painful
placement of his barbs owes more to
Wilde or to the French humorists. The
book might easily have been just
another exercise in the tradition of
“1066 And All That.” It succeeds
instead in lacerating some of our more
delicate feelings about our sexual selves
in a way that the schoolboy-howler
style of humorous history could never
hope to do. Whether this is a Good
Thing or not depends on one’s sensi-
tivity—or perhaps on one’s experience
of women.
The dark Danube
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Night Falls on the City. Sarah Gain-
ham. Collins. $3.85.
THIS NOVEL is, fortunately, not
what it seems. Although it has as
heroine one of the most enchanting
and maddening cities in Europe,
Vienna, and an alarming initial list
of some 45 “characters in order of
appearance,” its fat bulk of almost 600
closely printed pages, indeed its whole
format, suggests at first glance another
of those fledglings of literary tape-
worms like “The Carpetbaggers” or
“The Prize.” It is neither the book of
the film nor the telly spectacular to
come. Nor should one be misled by
the author’s reputation as a writer of
suspense fiction. “Night Falls on the
City” is a subtle study in depth of
the Viennese from the 1938 Anschluss
to the Russian invasion of 1945.
Both Sarah Gainham and her hus-
band are foreign correspondents who
have lived in Germany and Austria
since 1947. But this alone cannot
account for such a penetrating assess-
ment of that curious, contradictory
phenomenon, the German - Austrian
mind. This novel shows the basic
differences in outlook, the underlying
reasons for Chamberlain’s taking his
umbrella to Munich, and Hitler’s mis-
calculation in invading Russia rather
than England.
In Julia Homburg, the central figure,
the author has managed first to cap-
ture, then to personalise, quite unsenti-
mentally, all that is best in Vienna.
She makes her the leading actress of
the historic Burgtheater, marries her to
Franz Wedeker (Wedekind +
Baedeker?), a scholarly, intellectual,
democratic politician, who also happens
to be Jewish by birth, and sets her down
in a cultural circle far removed from
Technicolor Danubes and operetta
waltzes. Through them, she makes
the apparent stupidity of two intelli-
gent people all too credible. Like so
many millions, this couple stubbornly
refuse to see the writing on the wall:
surely Hitler, with his beer-hall rallies
and Chaplinesque grimaces, is nothing
but a bad joke that no one in their
comfortable and successful position
need regard seriously!
Doubly blacklisted, Franz tries too
late to cross the border after the blood-
less takeover of Austria. He leaps
from the moving train one carriage
ahead of the Gestapo and, returning
home, is hidden by Julia and her old
servant, Fina, in a secret room where
he writes a book of political philosophy.
Although other members of his family
are murdered, he survives the SS, a
serious illness, and bombing raids, only
to die at the hands of some indiscri-
minate trigger-happy Russians coming
like dangerous, uncontrollable children
to liberate the city (as, in fact, the
modern composer Webern died mis-
takenly at the hands of the American
troops).
By approaching her subject more
analytically than emotionally, the
author, within the framework of the
story, examines the psychology not only
of the obvious appeal of Nazism to the
bully and the no-hoper but also of the
more puzzling, subliminal enticements
it held out for so many others.
All the many shades of Austrian
reactions to Nazism are here: the collab-
orators from conviction, the fellow-
travellers from expediency (the “Herr
Karls”), the weak decadent aristocracy,
the downright obstructionists, the
servile fawners and the petty rubber-
stamping bureaucrats come into their
promised land, plus, of course, the anti-
Semites (“All Viennese are anti-
Semites, even the Jews”). In view of
recent events much of this reads again
more like future prophecy than past
history.

Narcissus
Lord Byron
By MARGARET IRVIN
Byron, the Years of Fame. Peter
Quennell. Collins. $3.85.
MILLIONS OF WORDS have been
written about Byron the poet, the
libertine, the traveller, the espouser of
causes. Peter Quennell’s famous study
of Byron between 1811 and 1816, first
published in 1935 and now reprinted,
is the result of responsible research,
dedicated interest, and a balanced
psychological insight.
When Byron returned to England in
1811, he was a practised voluptuary.
Heavily in debt, he had not yet suc-
ceeded to his title, and had just begun
to make his mark as a poet. But he
brought with him the first cantos of
“Childe Harold,” and, some months
later, woke to find himself famous.
From 1812 until 1816, he lived the
part of the most pursued, adored,
notorious profligate and social lion. His
beauty, posturings, affairs, debts, and
eccentricities shocked and delighted his
admirers. He was also possessed by a
certainty that he was a man of destiny,
and that fame and wealth would
inevitably come to him. Therefore, his
actions were always marked by oppor-
tunism. He was a showman par excel-
lence.
His life could be simply described as
evil, if it were not that goodness and
wickedness are never simple, and
should not be dismissed without a
search for cause and effect. Byron was
a complex character with “a dan-
gerous and disturbing heritage.” He
came from “a short-lived, disastrous,
dissolute family.” So much for
heredity. An early, unhappy environ-
ment completed the unattractive frame-
work. Congenitally lame, he was
abnormally sensitive about his de-
formity, and his unfeeling mother
added to his misery by referring to
him as “a lame brat.” His early years
were spent in Scotland, where he was
the charge of a Calvinistic nurse, whose
treatment of him appeared to alter-
nate between religious instruction and
displays of erotic affection. For the
latter offences, she was dismissed.
At Harrow, Byron gathered about
him, as a substitute for his mother’s
care and affection, young sybarites to
whom he was passionately attached.
At Cambridge, he appears to have
eaten and drunk and whored a great
deal. Even so, he had periods of
ascetic abstemiousness.
All his life he was to follow this see-
saw pattern of behaviour. As Peter
Quennell points out, Byron was not
amoral, but immoral, with a consequent
sense of guilt which became an obses-
sion. Like all obsessions, it had to be
fed, and only further sins could provide
more fuel for the flames.
It is, perhaps, mere historical chit-
chat that his “ethereal” pallor was
due to an excessive use of purgatives,
and, on occasions, to a diet of soda
biscuits and water, and that the dis-
position of the curls on his handsome,
high forehead was the result of curl-
papers, but the following observations
are most apposite: “I have suggested
that his nature included a pronounced
strain of homosexual feeling; but, as
in many bisexual temperaments, the
emotion was curiously narcissistic. We
love only ourselves, declares Paul
Valery; in love, it is the self we desire,
the self that we long to encounter; and
of Byron it is certainly true that a pas-
sionate preoccupation with himself—a
personage both loved and abominated—
ran more deeply than any normal
passion.”
This dichotomy helps to explain his
capacity for cruelty and kindness, easy
love and just as easy hatred; his Calvi-
nistic attitudes and debauchery, his
femininity and masculinity. Despite
passionate feelings for youthful
members of his own sex, for instance,
he could be very much a man among
men. His friends, the most prominent
being Hobhouse and Tom Moore, were
unswervingly loyal to him, and, in his
relations with them, there was not
a trace of homosexual feeling.
His will for power and fame was
offset by heavy indolence and attacks
of ennui, but the former was the driving
force behind his poetry. He had demonic
fits of inspiration, and would compose
at odd hours and in odd situations.
“Byron’s genius was, in short, instinc-
tive,” yet “few writers have had less
general aesthetic sensibility.” It j s
strange that the excessively romantic
Byron revered Pope and castigated
Keats “Johnny Keats’ piss a bed
poetry.”
One cannot help liking Byron, for
every vicious characteristic in him was
matched by its opposite. People today
may neglect his poetry, but it is almost
certain they will want to read about
his life.

Forward thinking on butter
By the RURAL EDITOR
BUTTER (IN AUSTRALIA) is
m ore than just for eating. Butter, be-
cause it is the principal dairy produce
export, is the key to control of the
dairy industry. The power of the Aus-
tralian Dairy Produce Board, the Dairy
Industry Council, the Australian Agri-
cultural Council and all the attending
appurtenances of Government is tied
closely to the export of butter.
Without export, the Australian con-
stitution (section 92, largely) would
have severely restricted the growth of
this control. Control is exercised in
various ways, sometimes with producer
participation and sometimes with pro-
ducers being little more than a rubber
I key to power
stamp. In addition to the above boards,
the Federal Departments of Trade,
Primary Industry, and Customs and the
State Departments of Agriculture ful-
fil certain roles, with the Department
°f Primary Industry, and its Minister,
the most powerful single institution.
Ah this began in 1926 with a voluntary
producer system.
Within Australia butter is made by
rarmer co-operatives and some pri-
vately owned factories but the mar-
king regulations and prices are de-
termined by the Government. It is
oubtful if the Government could have
S°t this degree of control without the
over the years, of export.
hether the industry, and the public,
' v ould have been better off is a good
Su ject for debate, which would be
ar § el y hypothetical.
A- branch of the Victorian Dairy
Farmers’ Association has just put for-
ward the revolutionary suggestion that
butter returns to the farmer should be
reduced by five cents a pound in an
effort to increase Australian sales of
butter. The suggestion will be dis-
cussed at the annual conference of
the Association in a few weeks’ time
and it may well be that it will be
thrown out. Even to get such a sugges-
tion on the agenda is, however, an
indication of forward thinking on the
part of at least some farmers.
The branch in question, Neerim-
Jindivick, points out that the problem
for farmers is one of increasing pro-
duction, through better management of
farms, against increasing difficulty in
selling the product. This is how
Neerim-Jindivick, in the heart of lush
Gippsland, sees it and in their par-
ticular case it is a statement of the
obvious. But it presents a rather dif-
ferent attitude to the one which pre-
vailed in Federal Parliament during
the debate on renewal of the dairy
subsidy. That debate, apart from the
speeches of the rebels, Wentworth and
Turner, was largely a competition to
see who could best support the tradit-
ional policy on which, of course, many
seats and many powers depend.
Neerim-Jindivick farmers suggest two
possible ways of utilising a five-cent
reduction in farmers’ returns. It could
be passed on as a straight-out reduc-
tion of five cents per pound in the
price paid by consumers, or it could
be used as a form of incentive payment
to retailers to promote sales of butter
in the stores. A combination of both
would be acceptable to Neerim-
Jindivick farmers that is, a reduction
in price to the consumer plus some
incentive payment to retailers. The
farmers appear to have gone into this
matter of a price reduction thoroughly.
In Britain, a cheaper home-produced
butter policy has actually resulted in
butter pulling ahead of margarine,
although it is still the more expensive
item. The lesson seems clear. People
will buy more butter .when it becomes
cheaper, provided this is not accom-
panied by a reduction in quality.
British butter promotion methods
are so good that Neerim-Jindivick has
suggested that the Australian Dairy
Produce Board adapt these methods for
use in Australia. This would go hand
in glove with an intelligent campaign
to expose the “false claims” of the
margarine manufacturers.

forward this list of suggestions are no
different to any other dairy farmers
when it comes to margarine. But they
seek a different approach. Perhaps
the most significant part of their pro-
posals is the reference to margarine
quotas. These have failed, they say,
because the quotas have aroused the
anger of the Australian housewife. How
very true.
This proposal will give the industry
a shake. It may not bring in any
worth-while change immediately but it
could be a beginning. In spite of the
logic of the suggestion that the home
market be exploited more fully, and
in spite of the obvious difficulties
ahead in selling butter once Britain
joins the EEC, the emphasis on butter
exports is unlikely to be diminished
until demand for a change in policy
comes from many farmer branches
instead of just one.

The point about
sacred cows
ONLY AT RARE intervals does this
column get down to the earthy bottom
of agriculture. This week, however,
quite unabashedly, the subject is cow
dung. Interest in this valuable and
voluminous commodity has been re-
newed here, in New Zealand, and in
India lately.
We often hear fellow Australians—
non-agriculturists, generally say that
they would feel happier about extend-
ing aid to the Indians if they co-
operated by slaughtering a host of
sacred cows. These critics, who believe
that charity should begin at home,
assume that the 80-odd million cows
in India are worse than worthless
because they must consume a great
deal of the productivity of land which
could otherwise be used for raising
human food. Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi is among those who have been
seduced by the facile solution that this
suggestion seems to proffer and has
launched several different cattle control
campaigns. (See 8., July 30, 1966,
which outlined one such scheme based
on the use of the contraceptive loop.)
The humble Hindus, who have an
instinctive appreciation of the funda-
mental importance of their cattle, are
naturally reacting against her pogroms
by organising nationwide fasts.
Such serious stirrings have stimu-
lated an American scholar, Marvin
Harris, of Columbia University, to re-
think India’s cow problem. His amaz-
ing conclusion is that India needs more
bovines and/or should feed the present
number of females better. His argu-
ment involves the vital importance of
cow dung in Indian agriculture and
the peasant economy generally. But
since agriculture is largely a matter
of soil fertility the world over, we will
see presently that we have a serious
obligation to make better use of the
cow dung that falls in our land.
Harris has calculated that India’s
cattle drop 800 million tons of dung
a year, of which 300 million tons are
collected by the women and children
for fuelling cooking stoves. A further,
but relatively small, amount is used
as plaster in the construction of their
rude dwellings. The heat value of
the dung fuel is equivalent to 35 mil-
lion tons of coal which, of course, the
Indians can’t afford, or 68 million tons
of wood, which they haven’t got. The
remaining 500 million tons provides
a highly valuable soil emolument,
particularly in a land where mono-
cropping tends to prevail. Possibly 160
million tons falls originally on road-
ways and uncultivated hillsides, but a
large proportion of this would ulti-
mately manure crops as it would be
washed down to the tilled fields by
the heavy rains.
It must be remembered that the
sacred cows of India are scavengers,
really, picking a herb here and there
along the verges of roads and ditches,
around the footings of buildings, tele-
graph poles, and so on. Harris further
argues that if the cows were properly
fed during early life they would breed
more often and milk better, so that

Sounds whacky, but it works. And to bring out the full potential of your best
Executives, $471 per man is virtually a no-risk investment probably less
than the bonus you pay right now. Plan the work schedule as tight as you like
the Hong Kong celebrity treatment (even at this minimum tourist rate)
makes any business trip seem like a holiday. And, of course, you can easily
adjust the type of trip to suit the man. Most important of all is that you'll reap
the benefits for years. Think about it. Then see your accountant. After he
explains the tax incentives, you might feel like trying a recharge yourself.
A trip to Hong Kong and
back is better than a
double shot of executive
youth serum. (And the
effects are far longer-
lasting.) Apart from the
relaxation of the trip
there and back, Hong
Kong is both a tonic and
an eye-opener. It jingles,
it jangles, it jostles, it
jives. It’s the melting pot
of the Orient that your
man shares with 4 million
others. He’ll dine like
an emperor and live
like a potentate. He’ll

see new ideas and new
people that will sharpen
his perception and widen
his outlook. Most likely
he’ll bring back some
bargains, too Hong
Kong is a free port, and
a paradise for shopping.
Frankly, there isn’t an
executive recharge in
the world to match it at

only thing your man

calf survival would be higher. India’s
dependence on cereals calls for the
plough, and hence a source of traction.
Bullocks supply this need, or rather
about one-third of it. There are simply
not enough of them to meet the power
requirements of the other two-thirds
of Indian farmers. Obtaining and
maintaining a pair of working bullocks
dominates the economics of every
Indian holding and explains many
seeminglv extraordinary traditions. For
example, an Indian will never relinquish
ownership of a cow, no matter how
weak or old she may be, because one
day she may rear a bull calf. Harris
concludes that the Indians are highly
dependent on their cattle and that cow
slaughter, if extensively pursued before
alternative sources of fertiliser, fuel,
and power are procured, would lead
rapidly to the deaths of tens of millions
of Indians.
On the other side of us, the New
Zealanders have completed a five-year
experiment which shows that chain
harrowing of cattle pastures to disperse
the dung pads is worth while. Though
the practice was popular once both here
and in New Zealand, the younger gen-
eration of farmers tends to neglect it.
In Australia's dry climate, cow pads
often endure for a whole year. During
this time they not only prevent pasture
from growing on the ground under-
neath but they lose most (80 percent)
of their valuable nitrogen to the atmos-
phere. Mr. P. Gillard, of CSIRO
Division of Tropical Pastures, Towns-
ville, has calculated that a typical steer
excretes about 301 b. of nitrogen in its
dung during the six summer months
of pasture growth in northern Australia.
Bought nitrogen, after allowing for the
bounty, freight, and the cost of spread-
ing, would probably be worth rather
more than 10 cents a pound. In South
Africa, where the climate is not greatly
dissimilar, cattle pads are dispersed by
various dung beetles within a few days
and most of their nitrogen (85 percent)
is safely buried in the soil. This con-
trast makes a strong argument for us
to try to introduce and establish here
the dung-eating beetles of the veld.
No doubt the CSIRO is busily sizing
up this possibility at the moment.
Valuable reprint
Economic realism
on the north
The Northern Myth. B. R. Davidson.
Second edition, pp. 283 and 22, Mel-
bourne University Press. Paperback,
$3.50.
THE ARGUMENTS that swayed
overnment planners in the relatively
small matter of a $3O million dam;
the costs of producing rice, peanuts,
sugar, safflower, and linseed on irri-
gable land on the Ord; the extent of the
necessary subsidies; the economics of
intensive cattle fattening in the north;
freight charges; the effects of tariffs,
and many more things are all spelled
out in this book. Important though the
accurate interpretation of pertinent
facts and figures is, the creation of a
realistic outlook about the development
of our continent beyond the Tropic
of Capricorn is vital. Dr. Davidson suc-
ceeds mightily in doing both.
Because it bluntly challenged the
fondly held hopes and dreams of many,
this book immediately on publication
almost two years ago provoked a storm
of controversy which, in turn, gave
rise to recriminations. While some
people sought to topple it by attack-
ing the minutiae of its data, others
claimed that non-economic considera-
tions, such as defence, were overriding
Wild hopes — Humpty Doo rice
and that the book had not adequately
disposed of these. In the heated ex-
changes some shocking assertions were
made, for example, that the supposedly
impartial CSIRO had suppressed
scientific findings which weighed against
the case for establishing an intensive
system of agriculture in the north.
This charge, by the way, has never
been officially rejected. Presumably, it
is either beneath contempt or too near
the truth. Certainly, the CSIRO, over
the past 20-odd years, has spent, and
is still spending, much money and effort
in demonstrating that by hook or by
crook crops and animals can be made
to grow in the north.
Despite the ructions, the book has
evidently triumphed, as it has now been
reprinted unaltered, except that Dr.
Davidson has added a second preface
of about five pages to take account of
new production figures. These do not
materially change his earlier conclu-
sions. Any taxpayer interested in how
his money can be used to best advan-
tage in national development and who
overlooked this book last time it
appeared in the shops should not miss
this second opportunity for enlighten-
ment and excitement especially at
the new low price.

Australian Image
Allow me to congratulate Mr. D.
Horne on “The Australian Image” (8.,
May 6). Having been in Australia for
six years as a student and having to
visit the Immigration Department every
year produces a certain attitude. I have
made many friends in Australia and
have great respect for ‘bird and booze”
and “beautiful” Australia. However, I
fail to understand many of my friends
when they ask me, “Are you stopping
over here or going home after your
studies?” This seems very unreal when
(supposedly) over 90 percent of Aus-
tralians are literate. “The old Chinese
taxi-driver in Singapore” mentioned by
Mr. Horne has a parallel in Australia
when I recall questions such as: “Are
there any cars in Malaya?” and “Do
you have cities like we do here?” I’ve
been had?

Young Executives
■“The Young Executives” (B., April 29)
was a timely, descriptive, and also very
polite harangue upon the business trend
of the present time.
While we who have been in the game
of selling and have most of the “quali-
ties” cannot join this venerated frater-
nity due to our age, we do appreciate
how hard it is for these young men to
try to keep up with us. After all,
the only way to run a supposedly suc-
cessful business these days is cling gal-
lantly to what is carelessly known as
Overseas Trends, and no amount of
psychology and careful pruning can
eliminate the need for the truly faithful
slave who, in his sublime ignorance,
does in his own devoted way cover the
lack of hard-earned experience in these
bright young men and so keep the
customer relationship at peace.

I was intrigued and appalled by Charles
Higham’s article (B., April 29). In-
trigued to discover just how closely we
are endeavoring to follow, in this aspect,
the American Way of Life. And
appalled to realise just how far we are,
as usual, behind the times, and how
stereotyped is our thinking. Mr. Higham
rriakes the point that conformity is on
the way out in the United States. Yet
here we are, again as usual, belatedly
blowing those we choose to think of
as our betters.
Can big business really profit by
employing a small army of perfect


carbon copies, grey silhouettes, each
exactly like the last? Is there no room
for the individual? Without advocating
the return of the robber barons, I
venture to suggest that think-alike minds
applied to industry, and, indeed, every-
day living, will bring about a state of
stagnation.

Tantrums in Travel
Your finance editorial “Tantrums in
Travel” (8., April 28) reasonably
points out that there are two sides to
the question of banks using their power
to grant overdrafts as a means of
gaining their clients’ travel business.
As an independent travel agent (and a
former president of the Australian
Federation of Travel Agents) may I
summarise the case against this practice?
Banks occupy a special position in
the economy. They are empowered to
supply credit for virtually any purpose
to the community at large. That the
tempo of business can be effectively
controlled by regulating the flow of
credit is an accepted economic principle.
To me, it seems morally wrong for
banks to juggle the economy in this
way with a view to making additional
profit from a non-banking function
in this case, travel bookings, on which
the banks earn commissions. If this
practice is not checked, what is to
prevent a bank from demanding travel
bookings and any other form of busi-
ness into which the bank chooses to
venture from a businessman who
needs finance to expand his enterprise?
Although I cannot accept that trading
banks have a place in travel, so long
as they engage in pursuits unrelated
to banking business they should be
obliged to compete on fair and equal
terms, and not be permitted to obtain
travel business by a method which, in
many other countries and many other
industries, would be labelled commercial
blackmail.

The Vietnam War
Your “Comment” and the accompany-
ing photograph (8., April 23) is worthy
of the greatest admiration; its sim-
plicity and humanity have gone right
to the heart of a dreadful situation.
However, I think there is an under-
lying assumption in the article that
once Australians find out more about
the Vietnamese war they will be more
likely to support our presence there.
This seems to me to be the opposite of
what happens. It is the people who
have found out the most about the
background and facts who are the
most concerned about the war’s con-
tinuance and escalation.
Very few Australians would like to
see Communism overrun South-East
Asia, but will the war avert this, or is
it creating a situation and a climate in
which Communism will be the only
effective system?

I am making a study of the English

visited both Australia and India. If this
is correct, it would have been some
time between September 1871 and Sep-
tember 1874. However, I have been able
to find no Australian reference source
to confirm that Lydia Thompson was
ever in Australia. Can any Bulletin
reader help?

Very Dry Run
I endorse your remarks about the
Empress of Australia (8., Feb. 2). I
travelled on the Empress with my wife
and two small children on New Year’s
Eve. Of a full complement of passengers,
only about 50 or so (when the purser
announced it was midnight) joined
hands and pounded out “Auld Lang
Syne.” Then God love him he
announced that the bar would remain
open till 12.30 a.m. Alcoholic beverages
were fairly hard to come by as you
mentioned in your article. Stewards
can only replace empty glasses, and my
wife is a slow drinker.
We were “first sitters” and upon
returning to the smoke room for coffee
and liqueurs we were informed that
we could purchase a soft drink for our
children only from the Milk Bar, but
unfortunately this was closed till 4.30
p.m. and again closed about 6 p.m., re.
opened about 8.30 p.m. well, as yot
say, there is plenty of cool water!
There is much more I could add
from other passengers’ remarks. I don’t
want to appear disgruntled, but, let’s
face it, you expect something for $3OB
return.

The AICD
In his letter (8., April 29) Simon
West, in defending the Association for
International Co-operation and Dis-
armament (AICD) against criticism in
a Bulletin article, leaves much unsaid.
In March last the N.S.W. State
Executive of the ALP imposed a ban
on the AICD. The (allegedly) Left-
dominated Federal Executive most
significantly, however, came to its rescue
at breakneck speed, and lifted the ban
the day before it was to operate!
If the AICD comes under strong
criticism from time to time, it has
mainly itself to blame through only
protesting and demonstrating against
some action or policy of the U.S. or
Australia, but never against actions or
policies of a Communist country or
government, of which many examples
could be given.

Critic's Critic
Miss Beverley Tivey, in her summation
of “A Man for All Seasons,” does an
extraordinarily poor job as the pathetic
“amateur” critic. The implication that
good films are often held back is
quite misleading “A Man for All
Seasons” was showing in Sydney before
the Oscars were , awarded in either
Hollywood or Britain, and, Oscar or
no Oscar, this film will remain one of
the finest and most intelligent portray-
als ever presented on screen.
It is a welcome change to see
presented a film about a man who was
morally upright, and perhaps for this
reason alone your critic was well out
of her depth which, one assumes, is
wading around in films devoted to
moral decadence.
Finally, this criticism of “Best film
the year? Best performance of the
year? Six Oscars? No. I’m afraid not,
is absolute piffle it is quite un '
warranted and must surely react to the
detriment of the critic.
