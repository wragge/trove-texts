The Child Mind—Some Samples
D. H. Souter has courted trouble (R.P.
15/5/’24) in directing writers for children
to “be simple—choose easy words—words
of more than two syllables are ineligible.
When they get to know of it, some million
humans under six will be after him for his
blood for giving that advice. The meekest
child hates being talked down to, and is
quick to detect and resent the patronage ot
deliberately cultivated “simplicity,” though
the resentment may be inarticulate.
It is foolish to lay down the law about
early mentality; but as far as literature is
concerned it is pretty safe to say (1) any
intelligent child likes what he does not
understand; (2) he understands a great deal
more than we guess; (3) his opinions are
well wrnrth seeking out, though extracting
them is a difficult and very delicate opera-
tion. They are apt to be funny, and that
is fatal. At the first sign of ridicule or even
suppressed amusement, back goes the inno-
cent little philosopher into his shell, and
thenceforth hides behind those solemn, in-
scrutable eyes of childhood that can be so
disconcerting.
Tried with poetry read aloud, young child-,
ren, like the savages they are akin to, pre-
fer strongly marked rhythm. “The Cloud
has often met with approbation, small
hearers following the recurring accents and
internal rhymes with evident pleasure. But
in one case when we reached:
That orbed maiden with white Are laden,
Whom mortals call the moon,
Glides glimmering o’er my fleece-like floor
By the midnight breezes strewn;
And wherever the beat of her unseen ieet —-
there came a giggle: “Like a tortoise wad-
dling!” It was quite a new picture ot
Shelley’s orbfed moon pacing the heavens,
and, once suggested, an unforgetable one.
Many a grave inquirer has grappled with
the mystery of the Dawn of Mind and in
the end confessed himself baffled. But there
is entertainment on the road. The young
stumbler into the English language, tangled
in analogies and associations and half-guessed
syllables, makes some very apt mistakes.
New Avords are coined, like “a dustagreeable
day” when the north wind was filling the
city with grit; and —this is a happy one—
“ Puss is sitting in a very proud cattitude.
“Joe Clarke” seems more natural for a figure
astride a horse than Joan of Arc while
some people would say “Lord . God” was
not far out for “Lloyd G eor S e -” '‘l could
tell you Psyche’s other name,” a very small
girl chipped into an adult discussion on
Greek names; “it’s Moses.” And through
the mirth that greeted this announcement
she maintained stoutly that she had heard
daddy say “Psyche Moses !”
Associations of words with other words
and meanings legitimately unrelated have
sometimes their origin in likeness of sound.
It is easy to see Avhy Emily’s little niece,
looking up at the chimney, should remark
pensively: “Whenever I say ‘chimbly’ it
makes me think of my Aunt Embly.” But it
is harder to guess the reason the same child
gave for her fondness for putting blue and
purple together Avlien she nlew'i
crayons. “No, I know it is not pretty,” she
admitted, “but” (with a pleasurable littie
shudder) “it makes me taste greengages.’
There is nothing blue or purple about a green-
gage. Perhaps the clash of colors set her
teeth on edge and gave her nerves a thrill
like that of “a sharp sweet; fruit to bite.’
But why should another infant say that the
name Ralph always made her think of mole-
skin trousers? Cautious cross-examination
elicited the facts that she knew nobody of
the name, and had never been told a tale (she
was too young to read) of a Ralph who wore
moleskin trousers. “But it sounds like them.”
slig insisted.
It is "a sad fact that the. hardened cynic
may sometimes refuse, to believe the angler’s
scale of pounds and inches of the fish that
got away. The world-weary sceptic may even
go as far as to doubt, just doubt, the truth-
fulness of all electioneering speeches. But
let him never venture an “I don’t believe it!”
when an original saying of a child is re-
peated. The more unlikely it sounds the
more likely it is to be genuine. When five-
year-old Bert had diphtheria his twin was
sent way for safety, and carried with her
the memory of distress at home and a dim
apprehension of the dreadful possibilities of
fate. These she must have pondered over
silently, till they culminated in the very earn-
est-query: “Auntie, which would you rather
do, have Bertie die on live all your life in a
wheelbarrow?” I defy any adult to have
invented the alternative. A three-year-old,
goaded by the miseries of a cold in the head,
stamped ' his foot and wished passionately
. that he had a “shiny tin nose.” Hay fever
or catarrh might exasperate a grown man
to the point where he momentarily Avishes
there were truth in the indictment of Ches-
terton’s dog concerning human beings : “They
haven’t got no noses.” But would the most
unscrupulous anecdotist have thought of a
tin one, much less of a shiny tin one?
Infants in church or class listen demurely
to the eloquence of teachers who must occa-
sionally wonder uneasily just what their
words are conveying to those active little
brains. Sometimes they find out quickly;
sometimes the child keeps to himself till later
years the sense he gathered from a spoken
phrase. In a history lesson, “The Piets and
Scots came over” meant to a certain little
boy that a lot of picks and some kind of
shovels were throAvn over a wall at the
ancient Britons by an enemy Avho smoked
clay pipes and wore boAvyangs. Tavo lines
of a familiar hymn:
Can a woman’s tender care
Cease towards the child she bare?
to another hearer naturally sounded like “the
child she-bear,” and the suggested picture
of a furry pet of the Billy-Bluegum family
helped to beguile the tedium of sermon time.
“What is a wortoise?” Avas an after-church
question. “I know a Avalrus and a tortoise,
but I’ve neA r er seen a Avortoise.” This ani-
mal Avas a poser, till trdeed back to “He
leadeth me beside still waters.” Very rarely
avc see the developing individuality take a
visible leap forward. “You’re my girl!” smd
doting grandma. “No, you’re my girl!”
chimed the circle of rival aunts and visitors—
“ You’re my girl, aren’t you?” Tiny Miss
Nora Ibsen looked round at the claimants
and said with the slow astonishment ot one
on whom the sun of a new truth has risen:
“I’m my own dirl!” ~
After all, the child mind is very like the
adult mind. It differs certainly m candor
and artlessness; but in its surprises, its
infinite variety of contradiction and inconsist-
ency, it is much the same as poor humanitj
grown old. Some minds never do grow up,
in the sense of opening out in imagination
and speculation. Others start. at tlieir very
inception to wonder and inquire. A group
of youngsters playing an old game repeated
the jingle of some half-forgotten folk-song.
When they reached the time-honored words,
Here she comes clad all in silk,
A russen a bussen as white as milk,
one interrupted the game to ask what a
russen a Dussen” meant. Should it be, per-
haps, “a rose in her bosom”? But the others
laughed her down. “A russen a bussen was
good enough for the children they learned it
from, and it was good enough for tnem.
Even so, Galileo, George Stephenson, Mrs.
Pankhurst —but it is dangerous to bring m
modern names. Anyway, even so was snub-
bed, and is snubbed, and ever will be snubbed
the one who interrupts the accepted order
of things, because he “wants to know.” And
so children mostly hold their tongues, and
humor the grown-ups who “teach” them.
ELSIE COLE.
The Evidence Against Caesar
Henry Molony (R.P. 5/6/’24) makes load
complaint about my statement that ‘ there is
not a tittle of real evidence that Caesar and
Cleopatra ever met” ; yet, though he fills a
column with words, he fails to produce any-
thing that could possibly be called evidence.
First of all, he declares that I am up
against Caesar himself in the last book of
his Commentaries. This is not true. There
is no statement in that book that Caesar met
Cleopatra. He goes on to say that Caesar s
work is completed in “De Bello Alexandriuo,”
and that here there is further evidence. I
cannot find it. The author of the book,
whether Hirtius or Virgil’s friend Pollio, says
that Caesar put Cleopatra on the throne of
Egypt. She may have come before him in
his purely judicial capacity, or the whole
affair may have been conducted by deputies.
Far from the proof absolute, which Henry
Molony asserts, of a meeting between them,
the most that is proved is that they were in
Egypt at the same time; and that is a very
different matter. Further, if the statement
actually did occur in “De Bello Alexandrine”
we should want a little more assurance as to
the authorship of the book to admit it as
wholly convincing evidence.
But it is Henry Molony’s reference to
Cicero that entertains me most. He has the
assurance to state, as if it were a fact, that
Cicero, in his letters, refers to Cleopatra;
and he allows it to be implied that the refer-
ences are to Caesar meeting Cleopatra.
Cicero refers to “the queen,” but it cannot
be shown that the person referred to is Cleo-
patra. He never mentions her by name,
never calls her Queen of Egypt, never hints
at any connection between her and Ca;sar.
We know that Arsinoe, who w r as also a queen,
was actually brought to Rome to grace
Caesar’s triumph. Any reference to be found
in Cicero may quite as easily refer to Arsinoe
as to Cleopatra. So it is ridiculously false
to say that Cicero furnishes evidence that
Caesar met Cleopatra.
Having exhausted the contemporary writ-
ers, Henry Molony turns to Livy. Livy
was 25 at the time of Caesar’s death, and
so might have had reliable information. Unfor-
tunately the books that might have contained
that information, like the historical works of
Pollio, are lo&t. Yet Henry Molony actually
presents as real evidence the things the lost
portions of Livy’s history might have con-
tained! Could absurdity go farther?
All the other writers mentioned belong to
a much later date. As evidence, their work
is just as reliable as a statement made to-day
about some unrecorded intrigue attributed to
Napoleon would be. Of these writers, by far
the most important, because by far the most
widely read, is Plutarch. , Plutarch tells a
picturesque yarn; and perfectly respectable
modern historians have taken his fiction for
reliable fact.
My point was that on just such slender
foundations as these much history is built.
Henry Molony rushes in to set me right ,by
giving a lot of references which in no case
have any weight as evidence at all. This is
hardly fair to the general reader, who is apt
to take a plain statement at, its face value
without going to the pains of discovering
how misleading it is. My own statement
absolutely stands as a fact : there is not a
tittle of real evidence to show that Caesar and
Cleopatra ever met.
I think myself it is exceedingly likely that
they did meet, and exceedingly unlikely that
there was any intrigue between them. What
is fairly certain—-though there is no real
evidence of that either—is that their names
were coupled in the injurious Roman gossip
of the time. Still, as Froude points out,
if Cleopatra was in Rome at the time of
Caesar’s assassination and living in his
house, she must have been there as the guest
of Calpurnia, who was certainly living with
her husband at the time. It is almost cer-
tain that Cleopatra pleaded before Caesar, as
judge, her right to the throne of Egypt; but
that merely judicial association would hardly
constitute a meeting in the sense in which
.we use the term. The whole story of
the intrigue may be true; but it would seem
that Augustus refused to believe it when he
put Cmsarion to death. The ground of
the killing was plainly enough Cleopatra’s
impudent claim that he was Caesar's son—
a claim which in the Emperor’s mind per-
petuated the original scandal spread by
Caesar’s enemies. Whatever the private
character of the greatest of the Romans
may have been, it seems hardly consistent
with our knowledge of his practical mind
that in those days of hard fighting and in-
tense danger in Alexandria he would enter
into an intrigue which was politically dan-

G. O. M.
W. H. Hudson
When W H. Hudson died a little while
ago the eritieal world had just begun to
recoenise that he was a master of English
S A few of his friends had discovered
the fact long before. I remember Cunning-
hame Graliame talking of him 15 years ago
in the Saturday Review as one ot the halt-
dozen writers of English who counted; but
at that time the statement looked a little
personal and eclectic. Graliame was a trienrt
of his, and, besides, Graliame was interested
in that South American world from which
Hudson had come. It was easy for lnm to
perceive the quality of “Green Mansions
and “The Purple Land,” but to other people
these books appeared shadowy and unsub-
stantial when placed beside those ot Hardy,
Conrad, Kipling and George Moore. .
Hudson's appeal, indeed, was not an obvi-
ous one. He did not announce himself with
trumpets. Even now it seems a little bla-
tant to refer to him _as a stylist, when his
style is as unobtrusive as the color in a
stretch of sunlit bush. In none of his books
are there any of those phrases that unroll
with a crackle, making a slight, stimulating
noise in the reader's ears and tempting him
along. His narrative is easy, flowing,'appa-
rently artless. It is not that of a man
speaking to a public audience, and concerned
at every moment with the impression he is
making; it is more like good conversation
between friends. Yet every page disengages
the charm of a personality that was so indi-
vidual that it did not need to draw attention
to itself in any conspicuous way.
Though born of American parents, Hudson
never visited the United States, and his
early years were spent in South America.
The wild, picturesque life of the pampas was
the chief influence that formed him. It is
easy to see in “El Ombu,” the finest of his
short stories, the eyes of an imaginative boy
brooding on the great tree that stood like
an island among the sea of grass, till an
epic of the pampas was shaped from it.
The ombu-tree was endowed, in his mind,
with a personality greater than any fragment
of the human life it sheltered, and this sort
of pantheism is implicit in his other books.
Like most men who have grown up in lonely
places, he did not regard Nature as some-
thing bland and idyllic, a pleasant field for
the arrangements of popular painters and
landscape-gardeners; he felt that it had a
life of its own, mysterious and never to be
finally subdued, and that its wild poetry
was only apparent to those who had no pre-
conceptions about its beauty or utility. In
“A Naturalist in La Plata” he explored with
the enthusiasm of a man entering a strange
world, where there are many wonders but
nothing personal to be picked up in the way
of trade or precious metals.
Perhaps “The Turple Land” is the most
charming of his books. It is a direct and
absorbing story of heroic adventure in one
of the South American republics a century
ago, and it has all the qualities of pure
romance. So much so that it makes the
romance of Stevenson and his disciples look
very cheap buckram indeed. The dew of a
country’s dawn lies on “The Purple Land.”
Starting from a haven of happy love, the
hero is plunged into a breathless world of
guerilla fighting where there is a clash of
swords on sunlit hillsides as swarthy patriots
meet in wild charges; and if a man falls
there is always some wonderful, dark-eyed
woman to bandage his wounds and lure him
into further adventures. Yet everything
flows so smoothly that no effects seem con-
trived or false. The world through which
the story moves has open skies, little houses
of white adobe, credible human figures and
great distances, but it seems a slightly dif-
ferent one from ours—a transfigured world,
in fact —and the hero can pass back with-
out compunction from his dark-eyed, roman-
tic women to the idyll he has left behind.
There are no questions, and no heart-burn-
ings.
“The Crystal Age” was not such a happy
venture. It is the vision of a time when
the race has been freed from all- the ills
that now trouble it, and even the turbu-
lences of passionate love have been over-
come. The chief thing to be said about it
is that most of the interesting things of
our present life have been eliminated with
the evils. There is a lack of warmth, vivid-
ness and the color of human flesh. Most
Utopias are singularly unattractive places
to inhabit, and Hudson’s is a dream-world
for angels with the habits of bees. In spite
of its beauty the imagination returns from
it a little lean and shrivelled, ready for a
good meal and a visit to the circus.
In later years Hudson crossed to England,
and was chiefly known as a bird-lover and
a student of Nature. But the rural Eng-
land he wrote about was not the tamed coun-
try of green fields and primroses; he was
more interested in Dartmoor and the wilder
parts of Cornwall. Indeed, he can almost be
said to have discovered an England that the
eighteenth-century upholsterers had covered
over —a primitive country of brown rocks
and scrubby furze, where there were still
stretches that had never known the plough,
and birds that had not been bred for shooting.
It is a little astonishing to learn from
Morley Roberts that this man for whom wild
nature was everything eked out a living for
15 years as proprietor of a shabby, unsuc-
cessful boarding-house in Bayswater. His
early books were forgotten, and his manu-
scripts came back from all the magazines and
reviews. Towards the end of his life (when
he was nearing 80) came a mild popularity,
but it was too late to be of any use to him,
as he said without bitterness. It gave him.
a chance, though, to renounce with a ges-
ture the small civil pension he had been re-
ceiving for a few years.
VANCE PALMER.
The Modern Martyrdom of Man
According to Dr. Harold Dearden {The
Technique of Living: Heinemann), the pub-
lic’s nerves are paying part of the price of
the Great War. In pre-war days “nerves”
were, like the “vapors” of the Georgian
period, a complaint chiefly of fashionable
dames of leisure. Betty at the washtub had
no time for “nerves.” “But at the present
day,” says the author of this volume well
worth the reading, “a complete change has
come over the whole range of medical prac-
tice.” Nerves to the right of us, nerves to
the left of us shatter and break us. Fol-
lowing on the long-drawn period of tension,
life has become more competitive, more en-
meshed in law, and altogether more exact-
ing. Civilisation has its obverse side, and
penalises every upward thrust by added
strain on the human machine till sometimes
we envisage a breaking-point. How to avert
that possible catastrophe, how to adjust the
human machine to the increasing strain is
what Dr. Dearden professes to show us.
His book is a combination of medical science,
modern psychology and every-day philosophy,
presented in terms well within the grasp of
Macaulay’s schoolboy. Its pages make us
reflect on the little capacity we show in
adjusting the delicate machine to the tasks
we put on it. A pill, a potion and an occa-
sional holiday are about all we give to this
servant of our will whose hours of toil cannot
be restrained by any industrial law. It is
the unceasing struggle to adapt ourselves to
these arbitrary restrictions that is at the
root of almost all mental and nervous in-
stability. The solution lies “in the preven-
tion of that initial error of thought which,
like a will-o’-the-wisp, leads these unfortu-
nate individuals, from the firm ground of
commonseiise to lose them finally, out of
earshot, in the impenetrable fogs and marshes
of insanity” :
The problems of life will be ever with us, bat
our method of approaching them can be profoundly
modified by training. The surest amulet against
mental and nervous strain in general is a true
philosophy, a practical method of approaching one’s
conflicts—in a word, a sound technique of living.
Though much of our behavior is purely in-
stinctive, intelligence may adapt instinct
to intellectual ends. Dr. Dearden empha-
sises the importance of the modifications
thus effected. He describes the three main
types of modification. “Negative adapta-
tion” is the getting used to, so as to dis-
regard, a particular instinctive stimulus, to
which, by frequent repetition, we have be-
come accustomed ; in other w r ords, becoming
habituated to our environment. Next there
is “the substitution of stimulus,” for that
which enthralled us in youth may bore us
in old age. And, finally, “the substitution
of a new response” for the one which nor-
mally was evoked by a particular stimulus.
To these various modifications of instinctive
reaction the word “habits” is given ; “and,”
remarks the author, “there is probably no
branch of psychology of such vital import-
ance to the individual as that which con-
cerns this vital property of nervous tissue.”
The formation of a habit depends essentially
on “the moulding of the plastic substance of
the brain into smooth channels, down which
the streams of energy may course with least
delay.” When an instinct is modified, the
flow of energy takes a new path to a new
destination. As a generalisation, it may
be said that the greater number of nervous
troubles are the result of nervous habits, and
good nervous habits can be acquired as cer-
tainly as bad ones.
Turning to the emotions, the author de-
fines their purpose to be “a prompting to
action” :
The presence of any emotion in our minds has
the effect of damming up energy in certain centres of
our brain, and so producing a state of unrest
throughout our whole nervous system. Until we
have dissipated the energy by giving way to the
prompting of this emotion and taking action, our
nervous system remains in this state of tension,
accompanied by a feeling of discomfort, and rest
becomes impossible.
An emotion finds its natural outlet in action,
but it may be repressed, or, alternatively,
find “indirect expression.” The effect of re-
pressed emotion is the perpetuation of the
state of nervous tension originally set up,
and this continued strain is one of the com-
monest causes of nervous exhaustion pro-
ducing the symptoms of lassitude, depression,
inability to concentrate, loss of memory and
the like. It is accompanied by irritability
of the nervous system, so that small causes
may produce quite disproportionate effects.
The sufferer, in short, makes mountains out
of molehills. The repressed emotion, find-
ing itself denied a legitimate outlet, may
secure the substituted one of indirect expres-
sion. “The value of this method is indicated
in the time-honored advice to ‘take the dog
for a walk,’ or it may take the form of in-
creased activity along intellectual lines, as
where an unhappy home-life drives a man to
immerse himself in his business.” The fatal
thing is to do nothing. Another avenue by
which an emotion may find indirect expres-
sion is “the habit of phantasy formation, or
day-dreaming,” for in such dreams we seek
completion for the emotions which are denied
fulfilment in the hard world of reality. This
psychological mechanism lies at the root of
all conceptions of a hereafter where wrongs
shall be righted and rewards bestowed. But
on this road to emotional relief a red sign
of warning is erected. The attempt to re-
turn from the dream world to the sharp reali-
ties of life may be too much to attempt.
There may be grave effects from this indul-
gence, even on the minds of the stable and
healthy, for such dreams “serve to dissipate
just that form of emotional stimulus which,
it properly applied, would tend to make our
visions true.” Often it is those whose emo-
tions are most rich and beautiful who do
least with them. Sterile emotions are vain,
inutile, and often destructive. “It is not
work that kills, but worry; and the basis
of worry is sterility. The secret of happi-
ness lies in action ; and to contemplate your
trouble is merely to domesticate ‘the worm
that dieth not.’ ”
Dealing with the effect of mind on body,
Dr. Dearden says “it is the merest physiology
to say that anger and fear have a harmful
effect on the body, and the same is true of
all depressing emotions.” The prescription
is : “Take plenty of physical exercise, exer-
cise that calls for no nervous tension, non-
competitive, not exhaustive, making no emo-
tional demand It is likely that when
the frenzied and despairing ‘golfer breaks
his club across his knee, he comes most
nearly to deriving benefit from his mis-
guided selection of a hobby.” Finally, the
doctor finds a place in his psychology for a
spiritual conception, and draws it from the
advancing study of subconsciousness. “There
is ample evidence,” he says, “to show that
through the sub-conscious comes that tide of
spiritual force which gives to some men
‘faith.’ We live normally outside this plane,
but from time to time we can, in the still-
ness of our minds, catch th,e low murmur of
its activity.”
T. B. O.
Literary Hoaxes
Here it is :—-
I can hear the bugle calling
And it don’t want me,
While the superannuation chap o’ Germany
’S a-fighting for the Kaiser in his Fatherland;
But our order’s for the young ’uns
O’ the old Brass Band.
We can stay a long duration,
Though the doctor said
How “the office will be worried when you drop down
dead” ;
But there’ll be a better judgment for
The Last Relay:
1 shall hear the bugle calling
And I’ll march that day.
No, I did not write it. It is two verses from
that masterpiece, “The Old Volunteer,”
which appeared in the London Times in
1915, signed “Rudyard Kipling.” There
were other verses; but you don’t want to
read them. In point of fact, the composi-
tion was not Kipling’s at all. The Times
apologised, and a vigorous and unsuccessful
hunt for the offender began. There are
some things, though, which can only be
wiped out in an editor’s blood. Evidently
the Times at the moment thought Kipling
capable of such stuff.
It would be difficult now to track the first
literary forger to his lair. Hoaxes of this
nature occurred in very early history. Onoma-
critus forged some verses of the Greek Thomas
the Rhymer to prove that Lemnos would dis-
appear under the sea 3000 years ago. Even
earlier, Solon, one of the world’s “seven
wisest men,” calmly forged a line in the
Homeric catalogue of the ships for the pur-
pose of proving that the town of Salamis
belonged to Athens. It is even a matter of
dispute whether Homer wrote the “Iliad”
and “Odyssey,” or whether, as Professor
Paley contends, both were forged at a later
date by a kind of Greek Macpherson. Cer-
tainly there are the faked “Letters of Pha-
laris,” the tyrant of Agrigentium, which were
written many hundreds of years after the
tyrant was dust. Among Christian writings
we have had so many apocryphal and pious
forgeries that the Bible has had to be freed
from them. And Frangois Nadot, in 1693, and
Cdrradino in the succeeding century, both
issued a sham edition of Petronius.
But the eighteenth century was singularly
prolific of forgeries, the most famous being
those of Macpherson, Chatterton and Ireland.
Macpherson w T as a Scotsman who published
volumes of what he alleged to be translations
from ancient Gaelic literature. He delighted
Gray and disgusted .Johnson, and the Great
Cham wrote to him: “I will never be de J
terred from detecting what I think to be a
cheat by the menaces of a ruffian.” Chatter-
ton is the best known of the trio. At 17
he deceived half England with the “Rowley
Manuscripts’'’ of fictitious poets of the
fifteenth century. He wrote these poems with
almost incredible rapidity—lie had begun the
work when he was 12—using Speght’s
“Chaucer” and an Early English dictionary.
The fraud discovered, he committed sui-
cide, the most youthful genius in our litera-
ture. Last of all came W. H. Ireland, accom-
plished liar and solicitor’s clerk. He started
in a small way by forging a Shakspeare auto-
graph for an old pamphlet, and thus pleasing
his father, who was a second-hand bookseller,
young Ireland forged legal documents relat-
ing to Shakspeare, cut off the ends of old
rent rolls, and bought up quantities of fly-
leaves, on which he indited letters, confes-
sions of faith, and even a pseudo-Shaks-
pearean play named “Vortigern.” Young Ire-
land was so successful in his documents that
Boswell went down on his knees and thanked
Heaven for the sight of them, while Sheridan
produced “Vortigern” as a Shakspearean play
at Drury-lane.
In the next century John Payne Collier
practised in a small way. He produced a
copy of a Shakspeare second folio, loaded with
ancient manuscript alterations, in 1849. This
found its way into the British Museum. It
was years before he was exposed, and it was
not until his death that it w r as certain he was
a fraud and not a dupe.
More modern times have not been produc-
tive of book forgeries on any such grand
scale. Only one is worth mention. That
was the work of F. W. Bain, Orientalist and
student of Indian literature. Writing at a
time when Asiatic literature was less known
than it is to-day, he had several of his novels
(“A Heifer of the Dawn,” “Descent of the
Sun” and the rest) placed in the Oriental
section of the British Museum as translations
from Sanscrit.
The whim of suppressed authorship has
many times provided literary men (if not
their readers) with a little entertainment.
Scott amused himself for many years in this
way. A. G. Gardiner withheld his name
from the brilliant sketches of well-known per-
sonalities which he wrote for the Daily
News in London; and Arnold Bennett
published “The Truth About an Author”
anonyiriously. In later days we have had
“The Gentleman with a Duster,” and (as
some maintain) Barrie’s authorship of the
“Daisy Ashford” book. But all of these give
way to the audacity of Bernard Shaw when
he produced “Fanny’s First Play” anony-
mously at the Little Theatre, and set the
three dramatic critics in the epilogue (made
up to represent well-known men) wrangling
over the authorship of the piece.
And then we had the Times and Mr. Kip-
ling. It is to be hoped that that jester wiil
not return to the attack. It would be a ter-
rible thing to sow doubts as to the bona fides
of “The Seven Seas” and “Kim.”
QUENTIN POPE.
Canberra’s First Hundred Years, by F. W. Robin-
son (W, 0. Penfold and Co.). Dr. Robinson goes
back to the explorations of Dr. Chas. Throsby, who,
in 1820, was the first white man to set foot cn what
is now the Federal Territory. Then he tells of
Lt. Joshua John Moore and Robert Campbell (he
of “The Wharf”) establishing settlement on the
Limestone Plains in 1823. Moore’s first huts were
erected on the high ground in front of Acton House,
opposite the present Commonwealth Bank at Canberra,
and those of Campbell’s superintendent were in front
of the older portion of Duntroon House. The name
Canberra (or Canberry, or Canburry) originally be-
longed to Moore’s river peninsula at Acton, but ft
was the bestowal of it upon the Campbells’ “family”
church that was the great factor in the preservation
of the name; and it is the history of the Campbells
and the church that mainly makes up Dr. Robinson’s
book. As the author says, the volume does not
pretend to be a complete scientific record, but it
contains enough information to give it a very decided
historic value.

Royal Cord lyres Are
Now Made by Three
New Processes Which
Have Revolutionized
Tyre Making
THE development by the United States Rubber Company of
three remarkable new processes of rubber manufacture now
gives to Royal Cord Tyres a quality never before reached by
any tyre.
1. The New Sprayed Rubber. A method so effective that
a virgin rubber of a quality never known until now is made
available to the world.
2. The New Web Cord. Of specific application to the art
of cord tyre making. A process of treating fabrics and cords
with latex, making it possible to manufacture tyres and other
articles with a degree of strength hitherto unattained.
3. The New Flat-Band Building Process. A method of
building cord tyres which is revolutionary. Finally and at
last assuring uniform cushioning and resistance in cord tyres.
Taken alone, either of these new discoveries would be regarded as
of the utmost significance, but together they are hailed as the most
important advance in the field of rubber manufacture since the
discovery of vulcanization nearly a century ago.
These three basic discoveries, fully protected by patents in the
U. S. A. and other countries, are the exclusive property of the
United States Rubber Company, makers of Royal Cord Tyres.

The Traffic Transmission
AT the automobile shows many manu*
facturers have exhibited cars on which
were offered certain new developments
involving brakes, tires, etc.
Some were accepted as undoubted im-
provements. Others are the subject of
sharp controversy.
In many cases these improvements were
offered as “optional”. That is, you paid
extra to obtain them. In others, it was
found necessary to cover their additional
cost with an advance in list price.
But the biggest, most important, most
fundamental advance of all was offered on
only one car, as an integral part of that car
—and at no extra cost to the purchaser.
This was the Traffic Transmission.
Embodying a totally new principle, it rep
resents the solution of the gear shifting
problem. There is nothing new to learn.
You move the gear lever and clutch exactly
as before. But the results are amazing.
You cannot clash gears. You cannot fail
in any attempted speed change, even when
racing down hill.
The speed and surety with which you
change to second gear gives you a positive
brake on the steepest grades. Vou can make
instant use of the motor’s equalized brak
ing power to stop short without skidding.
With no fumbling to change gears, you
park with ease and dispatch.
Small wonder that the Chandler is nation-
ally regarded as the easiest and safest of al!
cars to handle! It is the only car which
combines the Traffic Transmission with the
Pikes Peak Motor
This phenomenal power plant made Chandler the
national stock car performance champion, in high
gear mastery of hills and in flawlessly smooth, switi
acceleration, it knows no peer
Phone for demonstration! Make a point of getting
behind the wheel in one of the new smart, hand-
some, low-priced sedans. You never drove a car that
handled and performed like the Chandler

The surest way to calculate how far the Condor
Sunlite excels is to make direct contrasts.
Factory Managers and Workshop Superinten-
dents will find it a fact that in those basic
essentials of efficient lighting that they are for
ever seeking, the Condor “Sunlite” does offer
striking superiorities.
Besides incorporating all the usual qualities of
Condor Lamps, the Condor “Sunlite” is de-
signed and built so that the whole of the rays
are deflected downwards, thus throwing the
maximum possible illumination on to the
desired point.

When all the warm apostles of the breeze
Stirred the new bloom to honeyed ecsta-
sies
And birds to song, and all the world was
bland.
Deep in the gentle places of the mind,
Chilled by the winter of some dim regret,
We walk with silence; and no thought may
sing
For love of life the mate-song of its kind.
Our muffled steps in the pale glooms are
set,
Passing from Summer on the path of Spring.

Seasons.
The summer saunters by in blue and gold;
Bright autumn, gaily drest in robes of
red,
Laughs back at weary winter, bent and old,
Blowing a kiss to Spring above his head.
The seasons pass. In silence soft and slow
The grey days die; the rising sap returns
To stir the trees; December noondays glow;
The crimson leafy fire of April burns.
Each bears delight, refreshment, soothing
peace,
Each day a link in beauty’s endless chain.
Their splendid pageantry will never cease;
Joy leads through loveliness to joy again.
Blue violets succeed the daffodils;
The purple pansy sees with amber eye
The budding rose. New bloom, fresh frag-
rance fills
The garden when the roses droop and die.
The rainbow wheel of life turns tirelessly
And swiftly; yet the tale is grown no less
Of seasons fair and beautiful to be
And sweet with all the flowers of happi-
ness.
0 happiness! And still the grateful soul
Shall drink at streams of gladness, spark-
ling, deep,
When it has drained the alabaster bowl
Of death’s cool crystal draught of dream-
less sleep.

“Sufficient, to the Day.”
(Hobart to Launceston by road.)
Herewith I cast away
The past, the future's load ;
Sufficient to the day
This ribbon of the road
Unwinding, unwinding
Before us as w r e fly,
Past berried hedges burning bright and
harvest fields alive with light
Beneath a clean blue sky.
A cool quick whisper stills
On either side, and dumb
The supple curving hills
Plow past us as we come
Exulting, exulting,
Exulting in our speed
That thus the landscape's coil untwines and
melts its long and gracious lines
To meet the moment’s need.
Save for that swift-hushed stir
Of life surprised around,
The car’s contented purr
Remains the only sound.
In silence, in silence
And clear delight go we,
Such happiness upon us shed, the brown
hawks planing overhead
Are not more proudly free.
The air against our eyes
Streams crystal-cool and bright,
The blue cloud-shadow flies
And we have joined its flight,
Forgetting, forgetting
That ever to our shame
Grey dust and weariness have power, with
other things which in this hour
I will not even name.

Because so drab her life had been
Since lost youth’s blossoming,
She chose for gowns rose, blue and green,

From wispy hair her poor lined face
Peered on the world forlorn.
She loved the green trees down the street
Urging to take the sun,
As, near day’s close, on slim prim feet,
She passed when work was done.
So sweet had been her dreamings dead,
Sometimes their grey dust stirred
When o’er them winds' of memory fled,
Sad winds she only heard.
The grey-roofed cottage dear and small
She built again in dream.
And through a mist of Spring rainfall
She saw the garden gleam.
Wistful she looked on young babes curled
All warm in rosy rest,
As once she lay, ere dimmed the world,
At her own mother’s breast.

DEBT AND THE LURE OF THE
CITY.
The year which closes on June 30 will be
memorable: only once previously—in 1921-22
—has the Commonwealth acquired more new
foreign debt. The amount, including a muni-
cipal loan of a million, is set down at
£29,850,000, while the figure of two years
back was £38,000,000. It is difficult to
locate any large new outstanding work to
show for all this outlay, though of small in-
sect-like jobs which escape the memory there
are doubtless plenty. No new State or city
or port or town has risen as a result of the
borrowing of these many millions, nor is there
one railway which could be described as a
national work. Among the still missing un-
dertakings are the South-to-North line, the
short line from Sydney to the West, the con-
version of the East-West line to a uniform
gauge, the N.S. W.-Queensland connection
with its costly bridge over the Clarence,
and the Sydney Harbor bridge. Railway
construction has been on a pettifogging scale
of late ; on the other hand, between June, 1919,
and June, 1923, the State debts alone under
the heading of “Land purchased for settle-
ment'’ increased from £10,170,000 to
£53.164.000, and such items as “Roads and
bridges” and “Public buildings, including
schools,” grew handsomely, though an erratic
system of lumping items, now under one
heading and now under another, makes the
details of these less easy to arrive at. Now
a scheme is mooted for the raising of a Fed-
eral £20,000,000 loan for this same absorbent
purpose. It was a mere £10,000,000 affair
some days ago, but it grew like the shady
plant of Jonah. Presumably the money is
to be subscribed in England, for the British
taxpayer is to pay—to himself—a portion of
the interest for the first few years, in con-
sideration of having some surplus population
taken off his hands. The amount, should it
eventuate, will either stay in London and
be used to pay interest bills, or it will come
here in the usual shape of goods. Real
money has ceased to be a movable commodity,
so far as its import to Australia is concerned.
Despite all borrowings, all the money known
to have reached here last year was £30,824.
* * * *
. In view of the great financial happenings
in the name of “settlement,” it is natural to
inquire how real settlement, which is indi-
cated by the growth of country population, is
getting on. This is how Federal Statistician
Wickens estimates the rush, from census day
(April 4, 1921) to the last day of 1923:

Queensland is the only one of the group
which makes a decent showing, and it put
nearly half of the new population that came
to its gigantic area into the metropolis. But,
then, Queensland was, until recently, effec-
tively decentralised into three or four States
by the fact that several of its railways didn’t
connect with Brisbane, but did with other
ports. If the year 1923 is taken by itself
the position is still worse, the estimated new
population added to the six State capitals
being 98,813, and that added to the country,
the minor towns and dear old Canberra
17,713. The respectable total of 116,526 new
inhabitants would justify a claim that Aus-
tralia is really being settled if it was a dif-
fused total; but when it is mostly jambed
into two monster cities in the south-east cor-
ner it only accentuates the abandonment of
the mass of the continent. And the two
States where the failure in recent times
to “settle” except in the metropolis has been
most awful are also the two which have
worked the settlement-loan swindle hardest.
Victoria has borrowed over £26,000,000 under
that heading, and Westralia over £10,000,000,
and both are still hard at it. Wherefore
some uneasy folk in England begin to sug-
gest: (1) That Australia borrows in London
in order to have real money there to pay in-
terest with ; (2) that it spends a correspond-
ing amount of paper money here on works,
jobs or freaks, so that it can say that its
foreign loan-mongerings are for works pur-
poses ; (3) that the position would really
be no worse if the gold borrowed in London
was openly used as revenue to pay interest
with, and the works and “settlement” and
sundries were dropped as too thin a sham
altogether. When, as often happens, works
pay no interest, fail entirely to promote
settlement, and are a drag on the revenue
for running expenses, it is better to owe for
them and not have them than to owe for
them and have them.
* * * *
The casual bankrupt of large estate is
quite capable of believing that he has a fine
surplus until some untoward event precipi-
tates an inquiry; whereupon he discovers
that he has been insolvent almost since child-
hood. A picturesque old generation of Irish
landlords ended that way. What actually is
the position of Australia? It may be taken
for granted that the present loan pace can’t
continue. The average peace debts of the
States, less all sinking funds, were over £94
per head at June, 1923, and the £lOO limit
may be reached this year. If we go on bor-
rowing it is inevitable that London will take
alarm some time or other, and if it takes
alarm suddenly the may be unpleasant.
A gradual voluntary affd continuous reform
might avert panic, but of that there is no
sign. It is difficult to see how this country
can at once pay its way in London when
called upon, but there are two plans by which
it may perhaps be made to do so. One
is by a great increase in the exports Of “pri-
mary products,” as they are called, though
the plough which prepares the ground for
the wheat really looks much more primary
than the wheat itself. Unfortunately the big
buyers in the outer world don’t greatly want
our “primary products,” barring wool, and
the Australian flocks are a sadly diminished
lot. Twenty-one years ago, when one-fourth
of our primary products consisted of gold, it
was otherwise, but now that always saleable
substance has dropped to be about one-
fortieth of our exports, and instead of the
gold output paying the interest on the whole
debt and leaving three millions of a margin
it covers only about one-eighth of the State
bill alone, and now there is a Federal bill as
well. Our wheat has to be sold very cheap
at this end so that, after paying for a long
sea journey, it may arrive at its destination
with a feasible price-ticket on it. And no
enthusiasm is manifested for our meat. The
other plan is, while still giving intelligent
encouragement to the production of primary
products, especially wool, to cut the imports
of manufactured goods down to bedrock; and
that offers far more promise. To create a
manufacturing boom might call for more work
and harder work-in other words, the artisan
might have to toil more after the fashion of
the ill-paid cocky than he does now—yet
something of the sort must come.
* * * *
But to make any boom worth having
it is necessary to be rid of thd habit of try-
ing to stuff all the population and factories
and wealth of a big State into one unnatural
city, and to get, instead, into the way of
cultivating the small industrial town. Ex-
perience has proved that population can be
attracted to new centres by the establishment
of new States and pew State capitals. Maori-
land, Tasmania, _ Victoria and Queensland
are among the evidences. And it is obvious
that a fair diffusion of population can be
brought about inside any State if the official
railway policy is to connect every promising
district so far as is possible with the nearest
good port, and then abstain from crooked de-
vices and rate swindles. It is by this method
that Maoriland, Tasmania and to a less de-
gree Queensland have escaped the common
fate by which a State consists of one palace
and a vast herd of hovels. The immensity
of the gap existing in some cases between
tne palace anu even an eminently respectable
hovel may be illustrated in this wise:—

In Victoria, according to the estimates for
last December, the biggest town was then
22\ times the size of the second one. Only
the systematic encouragement of the minor
towns, which implies the systematic dis-
couragement of the overgrown capitals, can
meet Australia’s case. The discrepancy be-
tween the absurdly large luxury of the metro-
polis and the absurdly small meanness and
dulness of the little country centre consti-
tute that “lure of the city” which declines to
be counteracted even if two hundred millions
are borrowed at 6 per cent, that people may
be “put on the land.”
PROFITS AND PROFIT-SHARING.
The much-advertised Nash, who has just
distributed a million dollars among his 4000
workers, is more likely to bring the Golden
Rule into further contempt than to solve
any economic problem by his alleged appli-
cation of it. His idea of handing the whole
profit made on the year’s work to those who
were “his agents in making it” leaves a lot
of questions to be asked, and suggests that
management and goodwill in traue have no
cash value. Profit-sharing has much to be
said for it; but here the profits are not
shared. They are given to a body of people
who constitute only a section of the organisa-
tion ; and the donor’s declaration that if he
did not make this distribution he would be
a thief suggests crooked reasoning. A sum
of £200,000 divided among 4000 workers
gives £5O per head, or what at American
rates of wages might be about an extra
month’s pay for each person concerned. So
from the worker’s point of view the gift
would not be overwhelming; and it might
be a far better adjustment to put the profits
of the year into a reserve and either slightly
increase the wages all round, or by an in-
crease of plant add to the volume of employ-
ment offering. Profit is not money inevit-
ably lost to the worker. A few years ago
The Bulletin, out of its office window,
watched a man start a little cardboard-box
factory. His staff consisted of one man and
about five flappers. Not only did nine-
tenths of the profit the employer made go
back into the business, but the fact that
there was profit induced friends to offer some
of their savings to extend the industry; and
to-day over 500 people get good wages in
one way and another through that enterprise.
Moreover, if it is theft, in the Nash view, to
retain the profits, a nice question arises as
to whether the workers have been underpaid
or the buying public overcharged for the
things the workers made. The workers are
organised and have their unions to fight for
them, but the buying public is without any
such protection; so the moral weight of the
argument seems to suggest that Nash’s
million dollars should have gone back to the
public, if the management was too high-
minded to touch the cash it helped to make.
The loud newspaper advertisement of the
gift opens up the whole question of the rela-
tion of thoughtful enterprise to the labor it
employs. It is untrue to say that the man
working on a farm or in a factory makes
the wealth that is produced. That wealth is
far more really the product of the brains
behind the labor than of the labor itself. A
great number of elements have to be con-
sidered. Knowledge of the business, the
organisation necessary to carry it on, the
marketing of its products and (in a less de-
gree) the goodwill created by a firm’s general
dealings with the public are matters in which
the worker is not directly the agent. All
these things represent labor of another kind
and of a kind so much higher than that done
by the average factory worker that they
have a right to be better rewarded. But here
there appear to be two distinct schools of
thought among the world’s greatest employers
of labor. Ford, w r ith his intense organisa-
tion and general scheme for making it easy
to do things well, is able to pay high wages
to the poorest kind of worker. He~shows a
reasonable concern for that worker, regard-
ing him as a piece of delicate machinery
which must be properly oiled and never sub-
jected to any undue strain, in order to attain
its highest efficiency and speed. Carnegie,
on the other hand, was inclined to regard the
ordinary manual toiler as of about the same
value as his bars of steel or the coal thrown
into his furnaces. It was for the men who
showed special skill and brain power that he
had the consideration—consideration that
went so far as to turn a number of them into
millionaires. In its main features the Ford
system looks the more humane and kindly;
but in its relation to race development and
human evolution Carnegie’s is the more
sane. Universally applied, the Ford system
must in the end produce two classes far more
widely sundered than even the nobility and
the peasants of the old Russian days; the
Carnegie idea wmuld keep life continually
moving, no doubt with a harsher turning of
the wheels, but with the fittest minds always
climbing from the ruck to the places of direc-
tion and command. It is not easy to see how
a young man trained to stick a spindle
rapidly through a hole several thousand times
a day in the Ford manner is ever going to
show the outstanding ability he may possess;
whereas the worst Ford workman, under the
eye of a Carnegie looking for other qualities,
might quite likely become a manager of works
in a few interesting and hard-thinking years.
A Nash, with his peculiar Golden Rule
notions of theft, appears to give no consider-
ation to working methods or the deeper prin-
ciples of organisation. His workers made
the clothing, therefore they made the money,
therefore he hands it back to them! It is all
crude and slovenly and indicates a shirking
of realities.
* * * *
Probably the finest form that modern in-
dustry could take would be a decentralisation
of effort, the creation of countless small fac-
tories producing finer articles, in the making
of which the artisan blended with the artist
and the old pride of craft returned. But
such a turning back upon our tracks seems
impossible at the moment. The world’s de-
mands are very large and the output of the
Digger organisations is necessary to meet
that demand. Yet there is no reason why
something of a larger pride of craft should
not go hand in hand with the making of
things on a larger scale. A sane system of
profit-sharing that laid the main emphasis on
quality of work and intelligent interest in
the job would go far to foster this. The
bulwark of every industry is the goodwill
° f th , e Public and a faith in the things pro-
duced. 1 here are firms in the world whose
names are a solid guarantee of a faithful and
honest article. In a country of new indus-
trial effort like Australia a repute of that
kmd can only be gained by having a spirit
in the factory itself as good in quality as
the article on which the factory hopes to
tound its fame. To promote such a spirit
should not be beyond the power of any man-
agement. Closer organisation on the Ford
pattern might do much; profit-sharing on a
just basis might sweeten labor and make sure
ot its constancy (though the profit-sharing
system breaks down when applied to babv
industries, which as a rule have no profits
to share) ; tests of intelligence and integ-
rity, on the Carnegie plan, might continu-
ally strengthen the brain of the industry.
But the first need of all is the will to turn
out the best and only the best. A mere
assertion that profit is theft can do nothing
but reduce standards all round.
“THE QUACK.”
It is difficult to define the exact position in
science that is occupied by medicine, or to
say where the profession leaves off being
academic and becomes merely commercial.
It differs from other professions in its cus-
tom of giving freely that which people have
not the means to purchase; on the other
hand, unlike every other branch of science
it is characterised by an intense and unyield-
mg conservatism, which is manifested out-
wardly by an extreme disinclination to
accept anything new simply because of its
newness. Perhaps this may be no more
than an expression of the sense of extreme
responsibility, which warns the profession to go
slowly and carefully. But it has been to
blame for the fact that many of the most
epochal advances in medicine have come from
outside instead of from inside the profession
and that nearly all of them have been forced
upon it slowly and unwillingly. In almost
every period, from the days of Hippocrates
to those of Pasteur, there has been found
this dislike of innovation, hindering and im-
peding those who would run ahead of tlm
crowd. Always has its weapon been that
keenest and most damaging of shafts, ridi-
cule, with which it has sought to confound
and confuse the men who refused to confine
their ideas to_ conventional grooves. Few
of the great pioneers have escaped derision,
and the greatness of these may be measured by
their ability to withstand it, and to triumph
over it.
The pedestal upon which modern medicine
stands is formed by those discoveries of
which the circulation of the blood was the
first. By it all former ideas concerning phy-
siology were reversed, and a new school of
thought was created. Yet Harvey was sub-
jected to the bitterest criticisms when in
1616 he announced his deductions from the
anatomical structure of the heart, and from
the presence of the valves in the vascular
system: and when 12 years later he pub-
lished his “De Motu Sanguinis,” he was
again assailed from many professional quar-
ters. Perhaps there is no better indication
of the mental attitude of seventeenth-century
medicine than in the works of Thomas
Sydenham, who in 1680 wrote that he dis-
agreed with the current professional doctrine
that venereal disease should not be treated,
because if there were rejected all afflictions
which men brought upon themselves there
would be little room for mutual love and
charity.
No period of medical progress is marked
by more hostile opposition from this conser-
vatism than that of the introduction of anes-
thetics. In 1798 Davy discovered the anes-
thetic properties of nitrous oxide, and imme-
diately discerned its value to surgery. In
vain he tried by practical demonstrations to
popularise its use. None would listen to
him, and 30 years had passed by before it
dawned upon the profession that the gas
offered a means of performing operations
that vvould be impossible without it. Even
then its introducer, one Hickman, a sur-
geon of Shropshire, had experienced 10
years of rebuffs which eventually drove him
to France, to place the results of his re-
searches before the Paris Academy of Medi-
cine, and to be laughed at there as well.
Both ether and chloroform have a similar
history, the former not being used in medi-
cine until nearly a hundred years after its
anesthetic properties had been described, and
then only in the face of much opposition.
It was in the height of the Victorian era
that James Young Simpson, of Edinburgh,
first made use of chloroform by administer-
ing it in an obstetric case. By doing so he
aroused a storm of protest and religious
objection typical of the theological teachings
of the day. Because the patient had suffered
less pain Simpson was attacked by many
of his professional contemporaries, who held
that all pain was a punishment for sin, and
that the agony of labor was in the nature
of a fair exchange, to be endured in a proper
spirit of humility and meekness. All over
the country medical men denounced Simpson
for his impious efforts to thwart the Divine
Will, and the Bible was quoted to prove his
wickedness and the inherent sinfulness of
attempting to remove the primal curse placed
upon women by the Almighty. Not until
Queen Victoria was given chloroform dur-
ing the birth of Prince Leopold in 1853
did the tide of opinion set in the opposite
direction.
The use of anaesthesia had hardly become
general before Joseph Lister appeared with
his doctrine of antiseptic surgery. At that
time the condition of the public hospitals
was incredible. A statistical investigation
in 1869 had revealed that out of 2089 ampu-
tation cases 855 had succumbed from “hos-
pital gangrene.” and that in surgical prac-
tice the medical officers were satisfied if the
death-rate did not exceed 50 per cent. Even
in the light of practical results Lister had
difficulty in introducing his methods, which
were regarded as being founded on an iro-


possibility. On all sties they ™
with coenticism and scorn. xne uermuu
hospitals accepted his teachings.tong before
those of his own country and when Lister
visited Germany m 18 <5 at the invitation
of the great military surgeon of the Franco
Prussian War, his progress was a trium-
phal procession. When it was over he re-
turned to the arduous task of converting
EI S knew no nation-
ality was demonstrated a few years later by
the ridicule and the abuse that greeted 1 AS-
tfitr’s efforts to explain the cause of puer-
-3 septicaemia. The refusal of the. profes-
sion to listen to him was based mainly on
the fact that he was a chemist, for medicine
has ever been reluctant to give ear to one
outside its own ranks. The stoiy of the
gibes and laughter that broke out when he
drew on a blackboard before a gathering of
Paris doctors the organism that was killing
half the women in the maternity hospitals
has become almost classic, and it was no
until angry public opinion had been aroused
in France and England that obstetricians

the organism could be avoided, and that the
death through it of even one woman in child-
bed could be prevented.
Even at this present day the spirit sui-
vivcs, and the same characteristic distrust
of anything new is to be encountered. In
Australia there are practitioners who regard
Von Erlich’s organic mercury therapy in
the same light that Simpson s contem-
poraries looked upon his use of chloroform
in midwifery, on the grounds that syphilis
is a Divine punishment, and that it is
sacrilegious to treat it with these compounds.
That their objection is not wholly a religious
one is shown by the fact that they Wl ll em-
ploy readily enough the older system of niei-
eurv and potassium iodide. Others vigor-
ously condemn the new and useful synthetic
drugs, while within the last five years one
of Australia’s foremost medical scientists
has been stripped of a university lectureship
and driven from his university because he
dared to teach his far-reaching researches
in organotherapy. , „
Because of this slowness to learn, medicine
owes a heavy debt to humanity, and one
that can be measured only m terms ot the
pain and suffering that might have been pre-
vented How much further ahead would it
have been had it displayed the eager acquisi-
tiveness of chemistry or biology during the
last 150 vears ’( And how much more pio-
gress would it be making now in the con-
quest of disease w r ere it to at the

paths that has always distinguished these

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Two Varieties of Settlement.
Angwin, the new Westralian Minister of
Lands, is a shrewd little Cormshmarb and
since the Labor Government assumed office he
has been trying to get at the truth about the
State-aided settlement of agriculturists with
little or no money or knowledge, which
truth was discreetly hidden by the Mitchell
crowd. Summoning a conference of mem-
bers of the Industries Assistance Board,
trustees of the Agricultural Bank and ad-
visers on soldier-farnnng, he was told tilings
which startled him. One of them was that
£10,030,070 of loan money, borrowed tor
the most part at high rates of interest, had
been “advanced for the development of farms
and farming business.” This amount, as
Angwin ruefully observes, is approximately
one-fifth of the Westralian public debt. But
it is only half of the story, for as much
again (or more) has been lavished on agn-
cultural railways, which are run at a mas-
sive loss. Commissioner Pope wasnt
present at the conference, nor do his pub-
lished reports go into details of loan expendi-
ture ; but apart from the Hedland-Marble bar
line and the short Bullfinch section, the
Government has built no other sort ot rail-
ways since 1904. At the end of that finan-
cial year the capital cost of the Government
railways was £8,956,000; on June 30, 1J23,
it stood at £19,160,000, and nine more agri-
cultural propositions, to some of which the
Commissioner refers dubiously in his latest
annual effusion, have been authorised by
Parliament or are under construction. Ang-
win should make it his business to ascertain
the capital expenditure and accumulated de-
ficit on such farming lines as are open tor
traffic. In the absence of district returns
all that can be said is that the Westralian
railways earned £1,497,000 less than work-
ing expenses and interest in the lust live
vears, the net loss per train mile being
20.41 d. in 1921 and 20.28 d. in 1919. On
the subject of direct advances to settlers the
Minister was informed that £1,888,400 had
been shovelled out by the Industries Assist-
ance Board, which has been supplying seed,
super., horses, cornsacks,
crop insurance, waggons and “sustenance
since the 1914 drought, and that £1,000.000
might be regarded as irrecoverable. The
Agricultural Bank has. lent £3,042,000 on
fixed mortgage to civilian . farmers. . On
December 31 they were behind with instal-
ments of principal to the extent of
£674,200; on March 31, “after a fairly good
harvest,” their overdue interest bill amounted
to £204,400. Soldier-settlers, to whom
£4.494.000 has been advanced, also owe
£242,900 in interest; their piecemeal
repayments of principal are not yet
•due. “The whole position is unsatisfac-
tory,” remarks the exasperated Angwin.
“This business of ‘heads I win, tails you
lose,’ the Government being the tail, has
been going on too long, and the Government
intends to stop it.” He .will render a ser-
vice to Westralia if he is as good as his
word. Past Groperland Governments have
had the settlement of wheat cockles, with
little capital and less experience, on the brain.
In the indulgence of their fancy 20 millions
(nearly £6O per head of population) has
been added to the public debt, at the rate ol
a million a year. Certainly some good wheat
land has been opened up, and there are pros-
perous cocky-eolonies where there used tc
be only salmon-gum; but for every grain-
grower who has succeeded, beyond question
four or five have faded off their blocks oi
remained as burdens on the taxpayers. In
the same 20 years, without any Aovjnsh of
trumpets or 'squandering of loan funds, there
has been a notable advance in the pastpral
industry. Sheepmen have spread over aban-
doned- goldfields and into “desert country
condemned by Professor Jeremiah Taylor,
the output of Westralian wool has gieatly
increased and the. quality (not highly re
garded at one time) has been correspondingly
improved by scientific breeding from higb-
grade imported stock. As a result, the -
ports of wool alone for the last three years
were worth £1,383.000 more than the exports
of wheat alone. The comparison is stnkii g
enough to suggest that the business or
gamble of “settlement” should m future be
left to men who are ready to back their
knowledge, such as it is, with their own
money.
A Chance for the Benevolent.
At a function to mark a conference of the
Association of Victorian Ladies Benevolent
Societies a member read a paper on ihe
Segregation of the Unfit.” An extract.
She had been told by a medical officer at Kew that
in 60 per cent, of the inmates the direct cause of
thei. lunacy could be traced to venereal disease,
while at Royal Park, where the medical officer had
effected wonderful and necessary reforms were othci
mentally deficient children who were also victims to
this disease. In one case, a small hopeless paralytic
would still have been roaming the stieets at
had she not made • inquiries and had him placed m
the home.
And the remedy?
There was already a clinic for women at uie
Women’s Hospital, and the children ot those attend-
ing were generally free from disease Women could
do much in taking care of individuals in their dis-
trict and in persuading diseased motheis_ to attend
clinics. They could not, must not, allow these things
to rest. _ .
Clinics are very good institutions m their
wav; and the permanent segregation ot the
hopelessly and dangerously diseased has long
been practised in the case of lepers. But
surely the first aim of the community should
be to prevent persons getting into such a
state that they need to be segregated, much
less lethalised —a measure of desperation
which the lecturer hinted might be best mercy
for some! At present thousands ot doctors
are working to discover a means oi prevent-
ing cancer. The Imperial Cancer Research
Fund was founded for the purpose, and theie
are other vast funds in other countries
directed to the same end. The annual cancer
death-rate has about doubled in the Past 4U
years • it has gone from .42 per 1000 inhabi-
tants in 18S4 to .87. It is a well-advertised
horror chiefly because it is painful (some-
times), according to what seems the _ best
opinion, spectacular and easy to talk about.
But it is not transmissible from parent to
child, and it is not contagious. From an
economic standpoint it is the most benign
of all diseases: its worst ravages are effected
amongst the old. Venereal disease (described
by Dr. James Barrett, in Melbourne Town
Hall, some time back as ‘ the greatest ot the
killing diseases”) is essentially the enemy of
the youthful, which is to say the section that
the State can least afford to lose. About 2o per
cent of its incidence is among children who
have not yet learned the meaning of sm. Une
victim may be tlie cause, inside a generation,
of the infection of thousands, and any one
of these thousands may cost the nation the
price of a small war. Americas Juices
family—the product of a syphilitic man and
a woman whose parents were almost cer-
tainlv diseased—had cost the U.S.A. over
two million dollars in institutional fees alone
when the case was last investigated. In the
words of Sir James Crichton-Browne, m
an address at the British Sanitary Inspec-
tors’ Conference, “syphilis was the direct
cause of a vast number of cases of abortion,
miscarriage and still-births, and it was a so
responsible for many deaths attributed ».o
other causes, such as angina pectoris, Bright s
disease, aneurism and cerebral haemorrhage.
The one bright feature of the ghastly picture
is that venereal disease, unlike cancer, can
be prevented. It has been prevented. Dur-
ing the war it was reduced to negligible pro-
portions amongst soldiers in the prime of lire,
and far from the inhibitions that govern the
conduct of many men in civilian conditions.
If all the benevolent ladies of Australia de-
cided to-morrow to jettison Messianic super-
stitions about the venereal i diseases being
punishment of sin, about the deterrent effects
of these complaints, and about the possi-
bility of abolishing them by holy counsel
and' prayer, and if instead they agreed to
support whatever methods of prevention the
scientists offered, there would be little need
for clinics inside a dozen years. There would
be no more “mentally deficient children and
no more “small, hopeless paralytics roaming
the streets,” as witnesses of the smugly
camouflaged Moloch in our midst. By a
trifling sacrifice to the inane gods of convene
tion and respectability these ladies might per*
form the most effective act of benevolence in
the history of the race.

The Triumph of Disease.
Last week Melbourne Hospital was_ dis-
closed to have 360 patients on its waiting-
list, and the medical superintendent re-
marked that “unless relief came it might be
necessary for the institution to close .its
doors.” Almost simultaneously a deputation
waited on the N. S. Wales Chief Secretary
and asked for £50.000 for Sydney Hospital
“to overcome the demands for extra accom-
modation in all departments, particularly m
the venereal clinic.” The vice-president of
the Hospital Board said that the staff was
finding it impossible to carry on, particularly
in the clinic, with the present accommoda-
tion, and it would be necessary to close the
clinic for three or four months in order to
catch up with the work” ; and another depu-
tationist mentioned that “they were desirous
of installing apparatus for the treatment or
cancer, but they could not do so on account
of lack of room. In fact, in this department
they were working under dangerous condi-
tions.” • What are such revelations hut. un-
answerable arguments against voluntaryism
as applied to hospital upkeep? Human beings
are individually kind. Nine out of ten are
deeply moved by the spectacle of a street
'accident to a stranger, or by the sight of an
animal in great pain: many, indeed, will
weep at the mushy sentiment of the cinema
and “sob-stuff” press. If they could only
be got to see the plight of a V.D. victim
(often a child who is suffering for the sin
of its father) or of a cancer patient they
would be as distressed as by any pictured
story of the necessitous wife and infant of
some picturesque American crook. Unfor-
tunately they are usually unimaginative in
proportion as they are kind. A less pleasing
aspect of human nature is its disinclination
to move in a concerted manner unless its
prejudices are aroused. A socialist party
can always collect adherents (many of whom
wiPl back their opinions with hard cash) by
fustian 'about “the bowelless greed of Fat" ;
and similarly most of the recruits to High
Toryism are gained by arguments implying
that every worker is a congenital loafer
and robber. Wars are made possible by
popular hatreds worked up on much the same
lines. But it is impossible to excite a large
body of citizens regarding either the malign
powers; Of disease (unless the disease is a
spectacular horror like plague, small-pox,
leprosy or cholera) or the pitiful weakness
of a hospital system. Venereal disease, in-
deed, which does more directly and indirectly
to populate State institutions (asylums,
gaols, homes for the blind, etc.) than any
Other has' its sturdy defenders —as witness
the case of a Sydney archbishop who last
week deprecated the educating of the adoles-
cent on such subjects—he called it “interfering
with innocence” ! What it all boils down to is
that the people’s health is as much the province
of the State as the nation’s liberty or the
individual’s property. Thousands could
always be relied on to consult private doc-
tors and patronise private hospitals, as at
present, but there is a residue that needs to
be saved from itself if only in the interests
of the community. The race will nerar attain
its maximum capacity for work and happi-
ness till it is as difficult for a habitually-
diseased person to go undetected qnd un-
treated as it is now for a homicidal; maniac
to remain indefinitely at large.
Partyism and Unrest.
The dominant note in the world to-day is
disillusion. This is the Age of Unfaith, and
Party politics are chiefly responsible, i-i
rewards promised to the faithful by the pro-
phets of old related to the next world: the
assurances of their modern substitutes are
just as fantastic, but, being concerned with
immediate benefits, they are capable of imme-
diate disproof. The most horrible examp e
of betrayed trust on record is afforded D>
the Soviet Government of Russia. Bolshev-
ism was to give the war-weary moujiks
peach : the standing peace-army Af European
Russia under Czarism was 950,000, under
Trotskyism it is 1,003,000. Phe Soviet
leaders promised Communism and an im-
proved standard of comfort for the poor:
after years of misery, resulting in the death
of millions from starvation, Trotsky and
his colleagues have reverted to capitalism.
Meanwhile these proven frauds are scandal-
ised at the poor performances of the British
socialist Prime Minister. According to one
of them: —
Mr. Macdonald's policy is that of a valet serving
a great lord. It is dictated by a desire to serve the
British bourgeoisie without diminishing his cretin
with the British workmen.
In itself the complaint is not unjustified.
Macdonald, when out of power, and in con-
sequence bright Red, pledged himself to give
the nation disarmament and make things
pleasanter for the proletariat by applying
the money thus saved to humanitarian
schemes. Almost liis first administrative act
was to authorise the construction of six new
cruisers; and a cable of last Thursday^sug-
gested that the Singapore dock project is by
no means dead. He promised to introduce
the capital levy and other penal legislation
against the rich; he has not even attempted
anything of the sort. In Prance Poincare
has been put out of office because his social-
ist opponents claim to be able to reduce taxa-
tion without endangering the nation s safety.
They cannot fulfil their promises either. It
Germany could not be made to pay three
years ago when the Allied countries were
solidly against her, she will not be prevailed
on now that the French are almost as un-
popular in England and the U.S. as the Ger-
mans were at the time France entered the
Ruhr. If Germany was dangerous when the
Ruhr was occupied, she is 10 times more so
now with the ex-Crown Prince home again
and a Monarchist Party accepted as part of
the natural order of events. In other words,
Poincare’s successor will proceed, tor all
practical purposes, as Poincare did. Any
attempt to put into practice the principles
by which he achieved power would produce a
revolution, and the politician in office shuns
revolutions. The revolution of violence is
only acceptable to those who hanker for mur-
der, loot and revenge; and they represent but
a tiny class in normal countries and normal
times. Promises by office-seekers are many,
performances practically nil; and with every
fresh proof of the untrustworthiness of their
representatives the sovereign people grow
more cynical and restive. This almost uni-
versal situation is the severest indictment of
Partyism and the strongest argument tor
Elective Ministries. No Party leader on
either side of a legislature seriously wants a
revolution, but Party methods give revolu-
tionaries outside their chance by imbuing
the populace with a contempt of Constitu-
tionalism, and a suspicion that unconstitu-
tional methods may, after all, be the most
effective. The Party system became an
anomaly when caucus government was
grafted on to it: in its present development it
is a national menace.

The Colored Brethren.
Dear Bulletin, —By a happy accident two
apostles of the brotherhood of man were re-
ported in Sydney Telegraph of a recent day,
and if each wasn’t surprised at the company
he found, himself in they are an unemotional
pair. One was old Laborite A.RTHUR Rae,
preaching the new gospel by which his party
is gradually putting the Red Flag , and the
Red Objective in the place of A\hite Aus-
tralia. Speaking of the gore-anthem, he
wrote: —
It inspires feelings of human solidarity, free / r f® n
the jealousies, hates, pride, conceit and folly of the
watertight compartments of mankind termed nations.
So far as the Red Flag is emblematic of the fact
that all races aiid nations are of one blood--so tar
as it svmbolises the hope that the workers by hand
and brain of every race and community will unite
for the common triumph of their class throughout
the world —I regard the Red Hag as infinitely
superior to all others as the Alps tower above an
anthill.
The idea is really that all dogs are of one
blood, and should unite and intermarry until
tliev produce the triumph of one common dog
—a very common dog, without jealousy,
hatred, pride (having nothing to be proud
about), conceit or watertight compartments.
When the Communists have completed the
capture of the Babor machine the organisa-
tion of this mixed creature will presumably
commence. The other report concerned a
speech by a Dr. Ritson, “one of the two
general secretaries of the British and Foreign
Bible Society,” at a lunch given at the Mil-
lions Club, where every “respectable gentle-
man who desires to talk nigger appears to get.
the glad hand and the liberal victual. That
of which he was accused was as follows: —
The cruel distinction of color in the races of the
world must soon cease. The black. races weie in-
creasing in population at nearly twice the rale ot
the white races. The white races had no right to
dominate over the black peoples. He was in a
position to assert that there were great possibilities
in the civilisation of the black races who, with the
vellow races, were intently watching events in the
o-reat Christian country—Europe. The Africans
were now coming into their place, and whether it
was liked or not they hud to be reckoned with. The
black races promise to develop into a splendid man-
hood There now were political jealousies between
races’ but the time was coming when these inter-
national troubles would pale into insignificance and
all races would blend into one great brotherhood.
The spread of the gospel in 570 languages was the
power that would achieve this result.
It is hoped that the good reverend was satis-
fied to find himself in the same camp as the
man whose creed comes from the terrorists
and atheists of Moscow. One view is that
tliG races of mankind will set together, in
sturdy Communist fashion, to blot out the
“bourgeoisie” in blood and bury them in
blither and profanity, while the other is that
tribes will assimilate to hum hymns and buy
Life in Death.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The French authorities have decided that no
attempt shall be made to restore the ruined town of
Thiepval, and that it shall remain ‘a dead village
as a memorial of the war for all time.” Cable.
No town is there. Man saw to that.
Where shops and pleasant cafes stood
Amid a landscape lush and fat,
And peasants met in merry mood,
Silence and desolation reign
As though the very earth were slain.
Here it is thought to keep alive
The fury of the battle years,
And ancient jealousies revive,
And memories of fading fears;
With this maimed soil perpetuate
An endless legacy of hate.
But Nature’s work is to forgive;
And soon the nation’s petted waste
With Spring’s gay colorings will live;
Flowers and grass with gentle haste,
By day and ’neath the quiet stars,
Will cover up these man-made scars.
Nor will the mother of us all
Unaided Peace’s mantle spread:
She will enlist to lay her pall
The help of the forgiving dead—
Their last, mute call to end a strife
That cost them all they loved in life.

Black Brother in North Queensland.
This is from a contributor whom The Bul-
letin has found trustworthy:—
I know nothing of the treatment of Black Brother
in other ; States, but I know a great deal of what
goes on here in far North Queensland, and it is
not to our credit. For years there has been a
steady drain on the blacks’ numbers. Periodic raids
have been made upon them by police in order
to fill the mission stations, which institutions the
blacks regard with fear and loathing. The Law
which puts - them into these stations is represented
by the police, with the result that the police are
feared, .too. At their approach the aborigines
hide, children are hurried away into the bush,
and they will not appear again until they .think
all danger of being carried off into captivity is
past—for the time. Far Northern blacks are now
transported to Frazer Island, and from theie the
desirable boys are being taken in parties by the
police and Jet out to cane-farmers on the Johnstone
River. People' in this Far Northern district, who
know the local blacks and are trusted by them, may
not employ'one for an hour without signing him on
with the police and paying a ridiculous wage, not
to him, but to the police. There is a large accumu-
lation of these funds, the property of the blacks.
It would be interesting to know if a proper account
of their origin and application is made, and to whom.
The meanest tricks are employed to capture the
aborigines for transportation to mission station or
penal settlement. A black and his gin and picca-
ninnies have been hiding in the bush near here for
four years. The police are determined to get the
man, although there is no charge against him.
Whether he is desired because he has so far escaped,
or whether the children are wanted for the cage, Cion
knows; all I know is that, in those four years he has
been the quarry of the police. Recently they got
a half-caste to help. them. They prepared a trap;
but four years of being hunted makes a “boy” cun-
ning, and" the poor creature, suspecting an ambush,
slipped away before the net closed.
A black “boy” belonging to this district was in-
duced some time ago to join a Japanese fishing-
boat. At Townsville he left the boat, and walked
overland to his home, not far from Cooktown. He
lived there quietly for about two months, when he
was arrested, and with his wife and children taken
*o Palm Island, a kind of convict settlement for the
blacks. He was charged by the Japanese with
making a hole in the water-tank. The boy said
that he made no hole, but that he ran away because
he was “knocked about too much,” and water to
drink was not given to him when diving. Diving
for shell and fish means long hours in the water,
and if the boys are not successful they suffer in
shortness of food. Who is to know if these natives
of a free Australia are properly treated by the aliens
who emplov them? We are not even assured of their
well-being'at Palm Island, or at other settlements
where some hundreds of blacks of different tribes
(and, therefore, often enemies) are collected, with
only a few white men in charge. I have heard shock-
ing' things; I cannot prove them, but they should
be investigated. If a protest is made to the Protector
of Aborigines the matter is referred to the police, the
agents. So, of course, people only protest, as a ruie,
in private.
Lo the poor Australian! He is weak, he is igno-
rant. There is hardly anyone to speak for him. He
cannot learn to till the ground; he is a nomad and
a hunter. We'take his hunting-grounds; and his
camps--are -hungry -because the hunters have been
torn away to use their strength for strangers. W e
force him into an unnatural existence, and wash our
hands, like Pilate, and are not even sure that while
in captivity he is fed:

the wares of the British and Foreign Bible
Society. But the parties agree that there
ought to be a great intermingling, tending to
the evolution of one common dog—both tem-
poral and spiritual mongrel, I assume. I
would like to suggest that the black folk
show no special tendency to increase except
where they are dry-nursed by white men, as
in Egypt, Java, South Africa, etc., and I
am not sure that the white man isn’t a fool
for his pains. The Africans in particular
apparently tended, when left alone, to dimin-
ish, or die out, or kill themselves off, and if
the white man left them I believe they would
resume the habit; and I wouldn’t call it such
a bad habit either. I don’t think that they
ever developed a civilisation, though they
have been found in places sitting among the
wreckage of white civilisations. The culture
that was imposed on them or taught to them
by lighter nations didn’t stick if they chanced
to get away again by themselves ; the Asiatics
and Africans who came to Spain, and wore
decked out for a while in Roman, Greek and
Gothic clothes, shed the garment of culture
when they quitted Europe, and became just
nigger again. The African in the United
States would probably do the same thing in
a worse degree if given the same opportunity.
llam may, as alleged, “promise to develop
into a splendid manhood,” but if one turns
over Ham’s p.n. to that effect the lack of a
reliable endorsement on the back is very
marked. My idea is that he will remain what
he is, and, as contemptuous Jeremiah put it,
will fail to change his skin. Anyhow', if he
has intentions of growing up it is time he
made a start. Furthermore, if the British
and Foreign Bible Society, by printing the
Bible in 570 languages, is going to abolish
political jealousies and “blend” races, it is
t ime it made a definite start also; and Europe
(say the Balkan end) would be no bad place
to experiment on.—Yours. Solomon MALA-
PROP.

Stefans son.
From Dr. F. Antill Pockley :
“Malaprop” is a good cognomen for the anony-
mous writer who sneers at Stefansson, for nothing
could be more inappropriate, misleading or in worse
taste than his rude gibes at our famous visitor.
They would be beneath notice but for the fact that,
The Bulletin is probably the most widely read of
all Australian journals, and practically the only
one regularly seen in the remoter parts of the con-
tinent. For this reason “Malapropos” diatribe should
not be allowed to pass without protest.
I have not the privilege of knowing Stefansson,
but have read some of his books and heard him lec-
ture on three occasions, and in neither one nor the
other does he claim what “Malaprop” misquotes
and misinterprets him as professing; yet it is on
such foundations that “Malaprop” attempts to
ridicule him, apd insinuates that he is a charlatan.
Fortunately there are others who know better and
who have a different opinion. The Professor of
Ethnology in the great University of Harvard, one of
whom a man of the calibre of Professor David
speaks with enthusiastic admiration as among the
gieatest of all the Arctic explorers (which is pretty
considerable praise), and of whom Professor Hill
Griffith and Captain Wilkins speak in similar
strain, who has been honored by the Government,
and whose lectures have been repeatedly attended
by the Governor-General and many of our leading-
scientists such a one can scarcely be the cheap-jack
“Malaprop” would have us believe; and one who
has spent 11 years in the Far North will probably
know more about that region, its flora and fauna,
climate and economic possibilities, than one who
has probably never been within hundreds of miles of
the Arctic. Incidentally, Stefansson is not a
“foreign expert,” but a Canadian by birth, and is
proud of his British nationality.
“Malaprop” reveals colossal ignorance as to the
geographical distribution of animals and Nature’s
limitations of their migrations when he says that,
because the bison did not migrate to the Arctic,
therefore there cannot be many reindeer there. As a
matter of fact, the very lowest estimate of their
numbers is five millions, and single herds estimated
at half a million have been seen. It would be just
as senseless to say r that, because the grizzlv has not
penetrated to the Polar Sea, there cannot be many
polar-bears there.
one ’. r should imagine, has asked “Malaprop”
to “worship at Stefansson’s shrine” (he is not
dead yet), and his declining to do so will cause no
one, least of all Stefansson, to shed tears or lose
any' sleep. Nor is it likely that his hope that
Stefansson will soon go away likelv to hurry his
departure—at least to the extent that anyone would
notice.
And from an ex-Naval Officer:—
“Solomon Malaprop,” in his analysis of Stefans-
son’s “new” discoveries, hits one nail on the head;
but he might have smitten a few more. A “good”
press hails Stefansson as the Polar authority, and
Professor David greeted him as “among the greatest
of Arctic explorers.” Shades of Parry, Franklin,
Nares! Stefansson does not claim to be a Polar
explorer; he has merely spent a few years in North
Canada and Greenland. His enthusiastic discourses
about the reindeer, the musk-ox and the beautiful
flowers refer to the lands of North Canada and
Greenland—not to the Polar basin, which is a vast,
frozen sea. Stefansson merely followed a long line
of people who for four centuries have nosed around
the archipelago north of Canada, an archipelago
which does not approach within hundreds and hun-
clieds of miles of the Pole, As for his discovery
that man can live on the country, Nansen and others
observed this fact when Stepansson was wearing
knickerbockers. The alleged new facts concerning
the Eskimo are about 150 years new. Danish mis-
sionaries and others have lived with the Eskimo and
compiled dictionaries, etc., ever since Hans Egede
began the work in 1721. In any case, the Eskimo don’t
live in the Polar regions, for the simple reason that
they couldn’t; they live in North Canada and Green-
land on terra firma, like the reindeer and musk-ox.
The nearest known land to the Pole is Cape Colum-
bia, and that is exactly 423 miles distant therefrom.
Once more let us solemnly remind ourselves that there
is no land in the Polar regions, and that Stefans-
son's beautiful flowers grow on terra firma in the
Arctic region, a very different matter.

The Proprietary Medicine.
There is no sense'in merely turning up the
nose at proprietary medicines. There have
been fraudulent pills and potions on the
market, no doubt; hut it is pretty certain
THE QUID PRO QUO.
“Exception is taken in some quarters that airmen Goble and Maclntyre were awarded only O.B.E.’s in
the birthday honors for their historic flight around Australia.”
GEORGE REX ; “I see some more of those Australian aviators have been doing things.
Pend ’em the customary O.B. E.”
MY LORD-IN-WAITING : “ Pardon , sir. O.B.E.’s were considered inadequate the last time.”
GEORGE REX: “H’m, that’s awkward. We’ve got to save the titles with handles for the
politicians and picture-people. How about making ’em J’s.P. —would THAT do?”
that the fraud does not have a long life,
and that the great majority of the remedies
in popular use are based on the formulas
of either medical men or chemists of wide
experience. The cure-all may be dismissed;
but of articles put on the market for specific
purposes it can be said without hesitation
that four-fifths of the homes of Australia
are their purchasers, and that in the country
districts, at any rate, they are indispensable.
Yet because charlatans have exploited the
public hitherto, Parliaments are occasionally
disposed to treat the entire body of pro-
prietary medicines as something to be kicked
and cuffed. In Victoria the Legislature has
gone so far as to declare that from a date
to be fixed (September has been mentioned)
every proprietary medicine—potion, pill,
powder or ointment—shall be labelled not
only with the constituent drugs, but with the
quantities used. This is not only quite un-
necessary, it is quite unfair, and it will cer-
tainly mean that some remedies of world-
wide use and of proved value will be with-
drawn from sale in Victoria, notwithstanding
that many Victorians may have employed
them hitherto with great benefit. \Y hy should
a man who, after long experimenting and
experience, has produced, say, an ointment,
and has spent a great deal of money in mak-
ing its virtues known, tell his lazier or less
knowledgeable and experienced competitors
exactly how it is compounded? If it is
claimed that it is necessary for the protection
of the public, the reply is that the plan offers
no protection at all: the mere publication of
the formula means nothing to the public,
though it may mean a great deal to a busi-
ness competitor. The proper thing to do—
the thing that is done in almost every other
country of the world—is to draw up a
schedule of poisons and deleterious sub-
stances, and require every person who puts
out a proprietary medicine, and who employs
therein one or more of those scheduled sub-
stances, to state the fact conspicuously in red
letters on every packet or bottle. That an-
nouncement would mean something to the
average purchaser; moreover, it would give
the public all the protection to which it is
entitled. As the law stands in Victoria the
public will not be protected ; and while it
will be deprived of the use of some of the
most valuable of the remedies, it will still be
able to procure the least valuable and the
most harmful.

“Tuart” ; Knighthoods having been granted
to the pony-racing and music-hall industries,
it was only right that the film exhibitors
should get one. The showman selected for
the “honor” is Tommy Coombe, of Perth.
Until Ben Fuller received the accolade,
Tommy labored in modest obscurity, content
with his share in spreading the culture of
California, as revealed in such pictorial
masterpieces as “Girls Go Gay” and “Abdul’s
White Tart.” Inspired by Ben Fuller's
example, he endowed a few scholarships, and
got pressmen to serve on the committee. He
gratified Government House by supporting its
languishing fund in aid of the unemployed
Somalis, and sending flannelette underpants
to the shivering Armenians. He arranged a
political dinner for a home-coming Premier,
and made Perth grin delightedly by joining
the Boy Scouts. In the result he has reached
the dizzy eminence of Ben Fuller, his
exemplar, and the outlay was probably no
greater than the local profits on one or two
pictures like “The Sheik.” Titles are cheap
nowadays. Still, they cost a lot more than
the irreverent multitude’s valuation—three a
penny.

A scrap of evidence given before the N.S.W.
New State Commission as to how things
aren’t done when the State is big and the
Circumlocution Office far off:—
Some 12 years ago the Nymboida hydro-electric
scheme was stated by the Minister of Works to be
the most promising in the whole State. A scheme
was propounded, and the inhabitants of Grafton
were very keen; but, unfortunately, the Public Works
estimate was £23,000, or £3OOO above the amount
which can be spent without reference to the Public
Works Committee, though the local council, and not
Parliament, was to do the paying. Then the fun
began. The Public Works Committee was started
on its inquiry in 1915, and it has not finished yet.
Agitation after agitation was raised, and in 1918-19
Parliament, without the P. W. Committee doing
any more, was induced to include in its Electricity
Bill the sum for the development of this work. Still
nothing happened towards installing the scheme.
The local people, exasperated, asked for power to
do it themselves, by a combination of local govern-
ing bodies or by means of a syndicate. The Gov-
ernment refused this request, and still did nothing
itself. Then the local people offered to raise a
loan locally, and give it to the Government to do
the work with. The Government at first refused,
but further pressure was brought to bear, and the
Government said it was willing to carry out the
work on condition that the district raised a local
loan, but insisted that the bonds should be non-trans-
ferable for ten years. Such an unprecedented condi-
tion prevented anything being done. After further
agitation amending legislation was passed relative
to local powers. The Clarence County Council was
formed to carry on the work with its own money
but not in its own way. For months and months
the County Council went from one department to
another. It could not get a loan till it had
possession of the land it needed. It could not get
the land till it had the Water rights it needed. The
water rights would not be given till it had the
money, and the money could not be given till the
whole matter was completed, etc.
In one form and another, about roads, rail-
ways, harbors and sundries, this sort of
thing has been going on for 60 years or so.
and it has been borne with a patience like
the patience of sheep and angels. No local
association has organised a strike of tax-
payers, or turned off the gas and left a
town in darkness, as a sign of mourning and
disapprobation, when a Minister dropped in,
or organised a stoppage of local transport
for his benefit. It suggests old stories of
the man with a grievance who spent the rest
of his days in the outer room of a Govern-
ment office till he became recognised as part
of the furniture, waiting till Lord Decimus
Tite Barnacle would become aware of his
existence, which that great personage never
did. He was an innocuous character, and he
died waiting, or else he is there yet.
♦
No one knows exactly where the Myerson-
Smith case is now, but the original verdict,
which was an expensive article, was upset
and there is to be a new trial when the
parties have finished half a dozen side-issue
trials to decide what form the new trial will
take. Dr. Thompson, of Sydney, first got a
jury verdict against the 8.M.A.; the judges
not only threw it into the discard, but re-
placed it with a verdict for the defendant
and shifted round the costs. It recalls that
legendary case in which the prisoner, by
superior agility, or greater financial re-
sources, hanged the hangman. The Privy
Council has backed up the judges against
the jury, as was to be expected, a jury being
so often only a bad joke these days. In
England an affluent farmer named Harnett
was confined for nine years in an asylum
though declared to be quite sane, and but for
the fact that he burgled his way out he was
apparently there for life. He probably
thought he had done a smart thing when he
got a verdict of £25,000 against the doctors
who put and kept him in, though it cost
£50,000 to get. Promptly, however, a court
of judges held, not that Harnett was really
mad, or that he put himself in the asylum,
but that a certain legal hair concerning the
apportionment of the blame between the two
doctors and possibly some third parties
hadn’t been properly split. Having weighed
the two halves of the hair, and decided that
one was half the ghost of a dream heavier
than the other, the Court declared £50,000
worth of proceedings null and void, and
ordered that everything should begin afresh.
Justice isn’t really armed with a pair of
scales these days. She carries a bookmaker’s
bag.

manufacturers contrived to make) the co. reported
a loss. The Central Wool Committee, which. had
protested against the contract, thereupon put in a
claim for compensation based on what 9047 bales
would have realised under the arrangement with the
British Government. What with interest the claim
has grown to £900,000, it being contended that the
British Government was entitled to one-half. The
facts were cleverly marshalled by Scullin, M.H.R.
for Yarra, who accused the Government of haying
agreed to compensate B.A.W.R.A. and the British
Government without consulting Parliament, and of
having had no authority for the payment of
£137,696. Bruce replied—unconvincingly—-that he
bad a right to make the payment out of the Trea-
surer’s advance, and insisted . that his Ministry
had rejected the British claim, although'B.A.W.R.A.,
“out of its generosity,” had divided with the Brit-
ish Government. But he was obviously unhappy
without Hughes. Also, he failed to point the moral,
which is that Governments are fools to meddle in
business, and so missed the chance of reminding
Scullin that that is the Labor policy.
A small army of Federal officers is kept
busy gratifying members’ thirst for informa-
tion, and most of it is not worth the trouble
or a quarter of the expense. It lately cost £163
in overtime pay to answer a string of conun-
drums put by a N. S. Wales Labor member.
Worse, it is becoming a habit to ask ques-
tions inspired by gutter-rags in the interests
of their vamped-up “sensations.” No doubt
there are difficulties in . the way of refusing
members the information they say they thirst
for; but at any rate they ought to be re-
quired to satisfy a committee that they thirst
in the public interest.
A witness from Tenterfield, on the Queens-
land border, before the -N.S.W. New State
Commission :
Over *'9o per cent, of the rising generation left the
district, most of them for the city, and most of the
parents went with them. All the secondary industries
of the district had disappeared, except the butter-
factory. They included two flour mills, tanneries,
cheese-factory, meatworks and boot-factory. The
railway system crippled rather than fostered indus-
tries.
There was a time in last century when a
Although the Commonwealth Parliament
re-opened for business on March 2t>,. after
having been closed for seven months, it lias
shown no disposition to grapple with the im-
portant work left undone last year. Adjourn-
ments and formal motions for adjournment,
a no-confidence debate and several miles ot
questions have taken up most of its time.
One sitting day was abandoned because a
Senator had died six months before; another
because the Government wanted 24 hours to
think over the censure, motion. Wire-netting
was discussed at length on a motion for
adjournment; then Italian marble, white lead,
the complaint of a military pensioner, and a
small local grievance against the Electoral
1 iopartment IS months old. In another case
a gentleman wanted to get a speech published
in Hansard before he went on a holiday : a
formal motion for adjournment, and the thing
was done. All this while there is a Defence
policy to be framed, a Commonwealth Rank
Bill to be considered, and a tariff to be re-
vised upward. Parliament should drop tom-
fooling and get on with its job.
A legacy from Hughes:—
For once the Bruce-Page Government has had
cause to regret the absence of Hughes. It would
like to hear him on his contract with his namesake
of the Colonial Combing, Spinning and Weaving Co.,
as a result of which his successors have agreed to
pay B.A.W.R.A. £275,393 (£137,696 has been
handed over), and, incidentally, acquired a censure
motion. The contract was made in March, 1920,
when Hughes was dictator; it provided (1) that the
co. should get up to 10,500 bales of wool at ap-
praised prices, out of the clips sold to the British
Government at a flat rate of Is. 3Jd., and resold at
a profit, of which the Australian pool got half ;
and (2) that in return for this- concession the Com-
monwealth Government should receive 80 p.c. of the
co.’s net profits. But instead of profits (which other

ing to grow up with the place and share its
future, and make a pile out of the unearned
increment, among other things, Now there
isn’t one town in the Ma State outside, the
County of Cumberland which looks as if it
had a future; and people don’t grow up
with the place, because it is growing down;
and the joy of making a pot of money out
of the unearned increment has ceased to

average bush town as in the Old Men’s Home.
British Prime Minister Macdonald never
showed himself more completely a Little Eng-
lander than when he decided to involve the
three biggest Dominions in the Irish Donny-
brook by appointing a representative from
each of ‘them to the Boundary Commission.
In Ireland an irresistible body is up against
an immovable mass. The Orangemen of Bel-
fast are determined that not a yard of their
province shall be added to the Free State.
The South is equally determined to have
what it regards as its territorial dues on a
basis of ethnology and self-determination.
The Dominion Judges wall only be asked,
presumably, to pronounce on issues of law,
but such fine distinctions will not be con-
sidered by the raging partisans on either
side; and whichever way the verdict goes it
is bound to be flouted and howls of oppro-
brium directed at the interlopers.
In four Assembly constituencies Victorian
Cockies are fighting one another; even Allan,
the leader, has Chanter against him for
Rodney. Allison, who is so ill that he is
hardly fit to go on campaign, is engaged
with three of his brethren in Borung. _ 1 re-
ferential voting and no pre-selection is the
Farmers’ slogan; but agriculturists, like
other humans, are liable to put their own
Cocky first and his brethren nowhere, it
they do they will deserve the smash they will
inevitably come.
Victoria’s Peacock Government has come
out with what it defines as “a bold policy”;
but, then, no Government ever comes out
with anything else. It is proposed to raise
a million for tree-planting, and also ‘to
nationalise the main arterial roads and secure
financial aids from the Commonwealth to-
wards their maintenance,” which is at least
heroic cheek. Also, and furthermore :
A Soldiers’ Settlement Appeal Board will be estab-
lished to determine on appeal the fair capital value
of any area, and whether it is a reasonable living
area. Power will be given in necessitous cases to
fix the amount that a settler may be obliged to pay
within the next three years. v ,
That presumably implies that one of the
big chickens is expected home to roost.
Out of the 53 millions of loan money which
the States owe under the heading “Band pur-
chased for settlement,” little Victoria owes
more than 20 millions. As the Government
made this a 'rush job, it raised prices against
itself in a brisk fashion, and then passed
its bad bargains on to the settler. Now he
begins to say that unless there is a liberal
reduction he will have to pass them back
again. The difference will, of course, be the
taxpayer’s funeral.
From North Queensland: —
Theodore will probably win the Labor ballot for
■ the Herbert, although Ferrieks is no mean opponent;
but his chance of capturing the seat will- largely
depend upon the time of the year in which the elec-
tion is held. In 18 months or thereabouts there will
be 23 sugar-mills in the Herbert electorate. ' During
the crushing season these mills employ, on an aver-
age, nearly 200 men apiece. Add to these cane-
cutters and wharf-lumpers, and it can be seen
What a big electoral factor “the crushing” will be.
But if the contest happens in March, when the
nomadic voters are elsewhere, Theodore will cer-
tainly know' there has been a fight, especially if W'.
H. Green, ex-M.L.A. for Townsville, or Dr. Kott,
Mayor of Mackay, happens to be his opponent. Green
is well liked in North Queensland, but is not very
keen on re-entering politics. Dr. Nott is also popu-
lar, and when that sort of medico takes to politics
he is a difficult man to beat. A good speaker, with
a keen sense of humor, the doctor won the Mackay
mayoralty agaiirst a Labor candidate after unsuccess-
fully opposing Forgan Smith at the State election.
To show their warm regard for Hollywood
“pitchers” the half-Priministers, Labor-'
leader Charlton, Vic. Premier Peacock and
others lunched in Melbourne the other day

to imagine Ramsay Macdonald. Baldwin,
Asquith and Cosgrave, of the Irish Free
State, rushing to feed with a person whose
claim to such recognition rested on his hay-
ing heaved loads of Yankee offal at a public
that never harmed him, but Australian poli-
ticians have peculiar ideas of the fitness of
things, and their legs are easily got at.
None of them suggested that pictures as
good as anv in the world, might be made in
the Commonwealth by Australian writers,
actors, photographers, stage-hands, carpen-
ters, electricians and so forth, in which case
the gentleman wouldn’t need to tear himself
away from the country nor would Car
Laemmle, Adolph Zukor, Myron Selzmck and
the like help to drain it of gold. And no
one thought to mention that local production
could be brought about by substituting High
Protection for the ridiculously low duty on
films. _ .
Premier Alec Peacock is not putting
much fight into the Vic. Assembly election,
but his first lieutenant, Argyle, has a ban-
ner in one hand and a sword in the other,
and his Avords are not as soft as lie uses to
patients in his X-ray surgery. The Minis-
try has made a big bid for the civil service
and railway vote —probably 80,000, count-
ing wives, sisters, cousins and aunts—by
proposing superannuation and a 48-hour
week for mental hospital and prison warders.
Nominations close to-day (June 12) tor the
new House, and it looks as if there will be
close on 140 candidates for 50-odd con-
tested seats. There is little hope of a
Liberal majority; the Cockies will again
swing the see-saw.
The little flock of Foreign-trade cranks
who write to the Sydney papers about the
blessed times we might have, grow almost
reckless in their assertions. One shouting
enthusiast who appeared lately in the Ikle-
GRAPH under the heading ot Remove the
Duties” offered this inducement: —
Remove the abnormal duties on cars, trucks and
farm machinery in general, and you have given the
average man on the land a chance to overcome his
isolation, and with his accessibility to the truck
and tractor at the reduced price so raised his effici-
ency that he can produce double the goods with hall
the effort, time and money.
Now we know why agriculture is so pros-
perous in England.
Recent developments have rendered it
doubtful whether one Labor party or seveial
will contest the next N. S. Wales general
election. In the rumpus between the Mate
and Federal A.L.P. executives, the former
body has scored, having boycotted the other
crowd’s inquiry into the affair of the ballot-
boxes with sliding panels and compelled an
A.W.U. organiser to absent himself _ from
the proceedings. On the other hand, it has
been obliged to yield to the demand of the
Communist-bossed Trades and Labor Coun-
cil, backed by the A.W.U., for a special con-
ference, at which all sorts of questions will
be discussed. Unless a general peace is
there arrived at (it has been hopefully sug-
gested that all faetionists should agree that
it was Tutankhamen who faked _ the selec-
tion-ballots), three factions will issue from
the scene of disorder— (1) the “moderate’
Lang-Dooley group, supported by Willis
and his A.L.P. executive; (2) a Red Indus-
trialist group communicating with Moscow,
and (Mi an A.W.U. group. The A.W.U.
and tlie Reds are at present united by
hatred of Willis and Lang, but it would be
humanly impossible to keep them together.
Neither could long restrain itself from the
fierce joy of declaring the other bogus.
; ..“Elizabeth B.” earns an unwanted crown :
Freedom of speech is a priceless heritage, but there
are salutary limits, as when the speaker is so free
as to require the protection of hordes of police. I
counted 23 uniformed men round the “Protestant”
platform in Sydney Domain-the other Sunday, and
one of them told me bitterly that a similar number
of plain-clothes men were wasting the State’s money
in the gathering. The orators confined themselves to
gibes at Rome (some, such as a waggish reference
to the physiological processes associated with the
consumption of the Host, of a broadly Rabelaisian
nature), and the galled R.C.’s winced audibly. With
fewer police the reformers would have to substitute
argument for ribald abuse. For my own part I re-
turned home to find that a gang- of boy-marauders
from Woolloomooloo, who over-run undefended Potts
Point every week-end, had stolen the lid of my

the back yard, and smashed the wash-house window.
Since the'two officers detailed to check the depreda-
tions of these lads were among the first I recognised
on duty in the Domain, I can claim, in a humble
way, to be a martyr to a splendid principle. But
I’d willingly swap the martyrdom for that lid.
“Singemoine”: The retirement of Austin
Chapman with a K.C.M.G. emphasises a condi-
tion that is pretty well universal throughout
Australia. With a few exceptions this is the
day of the Old Man in politics—meaning not
so'much the man stricken in years as the
one with a long record of Party battling to
his cheek. Something like it was the chief
cause of tlie collapse of the Roman Republic.
In Cato’s day, and afterwards, practically
anyone wlio was not in the political swim
who was not related to a dictator, censor,
consul or praetor—was a “new man,” and
hence ineligible for the comtemporaneous
equivalent of pre-selections, Ministerial pre-
ferments, etc. Sir William Smith (“His-
tory of Rome”) observes of those who had
“exclusive possession of the Government”:
Their wealth enabled them not only to incur a
prodigious expense in the celebration of the public*
games, with a view of gaining the votes of the people
at future elections, but also to spend large sums of
money in the actual purchase of votes. The first
law against bribery was passed in 181 8.c., a sure
proof of the growth of the practice.
It may not have quite come to that in the
case of our Party monopolists, Labor and
anti-Labor, but a smell of it is there, and it
is growing stronger.

And the mule-like kick in the new-flung dope makes
ginger pop of the old,
And still in the offing the Rum Fleet rocks, with
the best for patrons’ tables—
Bottles whose corks have aureate frocks or treble
stars for labels—
And the Wall-street holders of shares and stocks
Put up a Storm like the equinox;
Is it any wonder it gives them shocks when the
anchors foul the cables ?

Bank of Australasia accounts are made up
for periods of 12 months ended October, but
as they are not presented until five months
later both the conditions under which the
profits were made and also the general
balance-sheet position may have undergone
considerable changes by the time the figures
reach the Commonwealth. On this occasion,
for instance, the drain on liquid resources in
the Commonwealth and Dominion has be-
come more and more severe since the ’Asia’s
financial year closed, due chiefly to the pur-
chase of bills for exported produce—and
these payments, especially for wool, have
run into big figures lately. Still, the accounts
allow comparisons to be made, and these are
fairly trustworthy, because, broadly, there
are the same seasonal influences at work
every year. The ’Asia is the second-biggest
bank measured by visible funds; its
four millions of paid capital and 3f millions
of reserves rank next to the Wales’s six
millions paid capital and £3,900,000 of re-
serves. Very soon a new share issue will in-
crease the National Bank’s paid capital also
to four millions; but its reserves will be only
slightly more than two millions. Arranged
according to deposits in the Commonwealth
and Dominion the ’Asia ranked but seventh
at March 31 last; Wales, £53,313,000; Syd-
ney Commercial, £32,237,000; National,
£30,842,000; Commonwealth, £29,940,000;
Union, £28,167,000: Bank of N.Z.,
£27,571,000; ’Asia, £27,170,000. The next
table shows how the business has grown in
10 years and how it is distributed: —

These figures, of course, do not take English
business into account. The outstanding fea-
ture has been the expansion of interests in
Victoria and Maoriland; the increases in
these two branches accounted for 73 p.c. of
the total growth of deposits in the 10 years.

Even though the British Corporation tax
was halved last year and income-tax both
in England and Maoriland was reduced, pay-
ments to Treasuries took 22.3 p.c. of gross
profit compared with 7.7 p.c. in the year be-
fore the war, and the expenses have so in-
creased that only Bs. 4d. in the £ of gross
profit becomes net profit instead of 10s. lOd.
in 1913. Nevertheless, earnings are so large
that, after voting large sums into the inter-
nal reserves which protect weaker securities,
proprietors receive 13 p.c. p.a., free of tax,
regularly, and in each of recent years
approximately £lOO,OOO has been left for
visible reserves. Provisions for all varieties of
contingencies have been features of the
’Asia’s career, and one corner of the balance-
sheet strikingly illustrates the effect of the
policy. London headquarters were recently
rebuilt —most of the cost was charged against
inner reserves —and freehold properties
throughout the Commonwealth and Dominion
and in London have an aggregate book value
of only £30,306. That is no more than the
current market value, of a few feet of any
of the bank’s city premises.

“Bills receivable and remittances in transit”
are nowadays such formidable items that they
are separated from advances. All liabilities
in October last totted up £31,474,320, but
after payment of the year’s divs. the bank’s
own funds amounted to nearly 7f millions,
and the management, therefore, held only
£4 Is. 3d. of the public’s money for every £
of capital and visible reserves. Looked at
from another angle, there were advances with
a book value of £25,947,537 and all the pre-
mises to give backing to £17,972,415 of lia-
bilities not fully covered by cash, notes, gilt-
edged securities, loans at short call and bills.

The English Electric had an eventful year.
Twelve months back the heavier electrical
equipment could be landed from overseas at
less than local production costs, the tariff'
protection being insufficient to wipe out
the foreign advantage in wages, etc.
In the report issued in April last
year the directors stated that the axe
of cheap imports was suspended over
several departments. It seemed that trans-
former and turbo activities, at least, were
likely to be very limited until more favorable
conditions returned, and that, while the large
amounts of capital tied up in these sections
would be unproductive, the co. would have to
depend a good deal on its electric-lift business
and on its agency arrangements with the big
English amalgamation with which it had
linked up a few years before. Subsequently,
however, the Tariff Board investigated the
industry and considered it worthy of assist-
ance. “It is not too much to say,” the direc-
tors record in their latest report, “that it is
owing to the sympathetic attitude of the
Tariff Board towards Australian industries
that our big Sydney: shops are in operation
to-day, and full of work.” That is hearten-
ing to shareholders w;ho have built up capital
from £168,000 to £403,000 (including deben-
tures) in a few years to enable the co. to
launch out as pioneers in the manufacture of
heavy electrical-equipment. Having completed
two turbo-alternators for the N. S. Wales
railways, two larger units are now under
construction, and, despite the competition in
transformer work, that section during the
year “secured a large volume of business, and
prospects appear good.”
The outstanding feature of the period was
that, though for months the management
concentrated on the costly work of preparing
plans and tenders for its bid for the North
Shore bridge contract, after writing off that
expenditure the profit was a few hundreds
larger than for the previous year, and the
usual 10 p.c. divs. are to be paid. How pro-
fits were made up is not disclosed; the
accounts tell no more than the net result
of all operations after depreciation and all
other charges of unspecified size had been
debited. Under current manufacturing and
trading conditions the co. is doing remark-
ably well if its newer activities are any more
than self-supporting; probably the mainstay
of the company is still the electric-lift busi-
ness, which should have been doing unusually
well during the construction boom. Until it
acquired the Australian agency and rights of
the big English amalgamation, this co. was
the Standard-Waygood-Hercules, Ltd. Nowa-
days the lift business is run by two subsi-
diaries, Standard-Waygood, Ltd., of Sydney,
and Weymouth’s, Ltd., of Melbourne. How.
balance-sheet figures have moved in five years
is shown next: —

Subsidiaries, etc. 86.757 74,976 70.944
The expansion of the enterprise was partly
financed by an issue of £llB,OOO of 6 p.c.
debentures due in 1920, which carried rigiits
of conversion into ordinaries after March,
1922. Shares were taken for £BlOO of de-
bentures during the past 12 months, reducing
the debenture debt to £33,400. The conver-
sions have had this effect: two years ago
debentures and floating liabilities exceeded
stocks, book debts and cash by £6374; those
liquid and semi-liquid assets are now £83,843
larger than all liabilities. Allowing for the
funds tied up in big contracts on hand, the
enterprise appears to be snugly financed;
apart from debentures, liquid and semi-liquid
assets are almost three times greater than
current liabilities. The position generally
is encouraging; the co. has certainly done
remarkably well to have come through the
recent very difficult period with a run of
three 10 p.c. divs.

Profits were a little larger than those for
1923 ; the reduction in the introductory table
is accounted for by provision having been
made for taxes on divs. Instead of taxing
individual shareholders the Commonwealth
Government now taps the fountain from
which divs. flow, thus relieving proprietors
to some extent and encouraging manage-
ments to squeeze a little more from trading.
Latest Sun profits are remarkably good,
taking into consideration that they were won
with a penny paper, whereas in the previous
year the price was for three months, and
that new wages awards have lately increased
exes. The cost of newsprint has, however,
come down a little, and on a big circulation
a slight reduction in price runs into big
figures. The published accounts of Sun
Newspapers, Ltd., do not give detailed results
of the business. The co. is nowadays partly
a holding concern: the two Melbourne dailies
are run by a separate co., in -which share-
holders put up £lOO,OOO in 8 p.c. prefs., eli-
gible to go to 10 p.c. if profits permit, and
the parent concern has provided the balance
of funds by re-investing in the subsidiary
cash raised from its own share issues.
Sltn Newspapers (Melbourne), Ltd., is
still in the development Stage; it has
so far issued no accounts, and sharehold-
ers in the parent co. cannot learn the finan-
cial health of the £302,466 of “investments”
shown-in its balance-sheet. The Sun News-
Pictorial, the directors report, has in 18
months “been established as a profitable ven-
ture,” and the evening daily in 12 months
has reached the position in circulation and
advertising which it took the Sydney Sun
five years to achieve. They are very encour-
aging results, and the directors are confi-
dent that during the current year both Mel-
bourne propositions will become profit-earners.
Meanwhile, the Sydney and Newcastle busi-
nesses are doing so well that the parent co.
continues to show a substantial surplus after
paying 11 1-9 p.c. on all its paid capital,
which has been greatly enlarged to finance
Melbourne operations, and almost one-third
of which is represented by goodwill.
How balance-sheet figures have expanded
in only five years is shown by the compari-
sons which follow:
1919. 1922. 19§3. 1924.
Paid capital. . £196,910 £594,742 £670,230 £804,408

Investments . . 90,110- 222,230 317,564
Goodwill ... 217,633 215,000 215,000
Paid capital has more than quadrupled since
1919, but a considerable portion of the in-
crease was bonus scrip from the reconstruc-
tion in 1920, when by writing up assets, and
giving goodwill a book value of £245,633,
scrip for 525. 6d. was issued in place of every
£1 previously held. Goodwill in the parent
co. has since been reduced to £215,000, but
£25,000 was transferred to the Mel-
bourne concern, and that co. may have other
intangibles on its books. However, even if
the Melbourne accounts were available to
permit a detailed inspection of assets, the
figures would not be of much value. In a
newspaper enterprise machinery can’t earn
profits without journalistic and business
organisations, and these latter no man can
appraise—the only worth-while test is,
broadly speaking, in the profits. In Sydney
the co. continues to make headway: the cir-
culation of the evening newspaper now fluc-
tuates between 186,000 and 190,000 per day,
and the Sunday edition has bounded to
226,000 every week. The five newspapers in
three cities have weekly sales of 2-\ millions;
a remarkable development of the little co.
with £24,950 paid capital which bought out
the Australian Star only 14 years ago
for several thousands less than its assets
were reckoned to be worth.

This is another co-operative wool and pro-
duce agency concern which is diverting com-
missions from middlemen into clients' pockets
and paying good divs. to shareholders.
Droughty conditions during the earlier por-
tion of last year considerably curtailed the
turnover of both wool and livestock, notwith-
standing that the management enlisted many
new clients in the latter department. Gross
earnings were £1574 less than in 1923. How-
ever, the management reefed exes., and the
net result was £1299 better than in the pre-
vious 12 months. Bonuses to consignors—
-30 p.c. of wool copimissions and 15 p.c. of
charges on other lines—took £7434. Alto-
gether in its 14 years the co. has rebated
nearly £60,000 in this way.
The next table gives details of turnover
since 1912, and shows how gross earnings

Paid capital was increased to £37,417 during
the year by a call of 2s. 6d. per share on
the 100,000 issued shares. The new funds
have been required to finance the construc-
tion of new wool stores and salerooms, now
nearing completion. The management ex-
pects improved selling conditions to attract
more business to the co-operative fold. Lia-
bilities at March 31 were heavier than usual:
£56,853 had been raised on mortgage (to
bankers) and £29,589 was owing to other
creditors. New stores during the 12 months
increased the co.’s property account from

As the N.Z. Consolidated Dental Co., with
paid capital which had long remained station-
ary at £29,431, this trader in jawsmiths’
supplies did fairly well. Div. rates were mild,
but shareholding-customers received a bit
more in bonuses on purchases, the business
having been to some extent co-operative. In
1921 the co. decided to widen its field and
handle medical and surgical goods ; also
shareholders agreed to increase capital to
provide funds for new headquarters and to
enlarge stocks there and at three branches.
Subsequently the co.’s title was amended to
describe more accurately the larger scope of
operations. Balance-sheet figures have

except £l4OO of the subscriptions went into
premises and fittings, and as stock “o*°°*
debts have also nearly doubled, the eo n
depending on a substantial overdraft. How
ever, against total outside liabilities of
f2l 372 at March 31 there were stocks, hook
debts and odds-and-ends of liquid assets with
a book value of £56,262.
Just about the time when the business was
being expanded, the world-wide slump m
values set in, so the 1923 financial year
showed a loss of £435, and £2OOO more dis-
appeared by a “quondam sound investment
turning out bad.” Last year’s results were
also disappointing; though turnover showed
a “very marked increase,” the management
could squeeze only 3$ p.c. on paid capital.
Nevertheless, the directors have drawn upon
a div. equalisation reserve to pay 5 p.c..
and reserves have declined to below the level
of six years ago. Considering the depend-
ence on bankers to provide adequate stocks
and the prospective requirements for ex-
panding medical interests at branches, the
distribution of approximately £lOOO more
than was actually earned does not seem justi-
fied. The directors say that values are now
all they should be, and they are confident
of the results which the enlarged business
will produce. But as 8 p.c. divs. will in
future require £4618 annually—and that is
more than the profit for any one year in the
co.’s life—the management has been set a
task if it has also to provide for rebates on
purchases by both medical and dental share-
holding-customers.

Ivanhoe has, after much difficulty, got its
No. 1 bore-hole down at Wiluna (W.A.).
When the drill started in February the co.
expected to learn something about values by
April, but bad ground retarded work, and
results to date have been almost negligible.
Unless boring can be speeded up there is
a danger of London, which has been keen
on the venture, becoming wearied. Most of
the country for miles around is still shep-
herded in ' the hope that Ivanlioe’s efforts
will be successful and create a boom which
will permit a gamble in many worthless
blocks. Meanwhile, almost every lease on
the field is described as “promising.”
* * * *
The affairs of Oroya Black Range East
(W.A.) are in a horrible tangle. Two pros-
pectors sold the mine for £4OOO to the co.
and also took up some thousands of contri-
buting shares. Subsequently a call was
made, whereupon the prospectors offered _ to
lend the co. £5OO conditionally. on (1) being
given a mortgage over the mine, (2) calls
on their shares being _ deferred, and (3)
being allowed to work in specified sections
of the mine until they had earned £5OO in
wages. The directors accepted the offer,
and now the prospectors figure as vendors,
mortgagees, workmen and contrib. sharehold-
ers who have not paid calls. On present
appearances, before long they will become
mortgagees in possession.

Hampton Properties proposes to use some
of the £20,000 recently raised by its new
share issue to buy more debentures and
acquire a controlling interest in the Celebra-
tion (W.A.). Chairman Slater told share-
holders in Edinburgh recently that the
blighted show looked promising at 400 ft.,
but that its prospects there had been rather
dimmed by poor returns through shortage
of water. Furthermore, lack of funds had
handicapped development.

Lake View and Star announces the dis-
covery of a big body of 2oz. stuff in work-
ings off a winze below 1600 ft., and shares
have soared to a figure which gives the show
a market value of £150,000. Ore going 2oz.
should give a profit of between £5 and £6
a ton, but obviously a big tonnage is re-
quired to warrant the value now given the
old show.

Edna May Central is reconstructing in
order to raise funds for a spectacular show
at Meekatharra, on which it has taken an
option. Central was one of the tragedies
of Westonia. In 1916 the co. put out a
prospecting crosscut, and cut a big bulge or
ounce ore. This development was boomed
to such effect that shares rose from 16s. to
£6 in a few weeks. The find was of little
importance, and Central never recovered its
reputation. #
Almost-forgotten Brownhill Central, Kal-
goorlie, has again been resurrected. This
time ounce stuff is reported from “a continua-
tion of the rich lode lost in the early days,
and a high price has already been placed on
the ‘‘new find.” The Bulletin’s recollec-
tion bf the show is that there never was any
rich lode in the property, and that the weakly-
financed Adelaide co. which worked it gave
up in despair.

From the secretary of the May Queen: —
The “Wild Cat” (22/6/’24) stated that the May
Queen, Southern Cross (W.A.), had been worked con-
tinuously for 16 years. It was discovered in 1909 by
Bill Domney and worked by the discoverer and his
partner, Fred Liddle, not continuously, but spas-
modically. During this period more than 3000
tons were broken and raised, but only 900 tons
treated, the balance forming a big dump on the sur-
face. The par. says that “the problem is wholly
one of tonnages, and the May Queen has been another
example of the folly of rushing up plant on the
strength of a few hundred tons showing.” LiddJe
and Domney gave the Perth crowd a six-months
option in December last, and the only plant they had
was a small winch for hauling purposes. Since then
a 5-head mill, boiler, compressor, receiver and battery
engine have been installed, the boiler supplying the
necessary power to drive the lot. The reason for
putting in this machinery was because the dump has
been thoroughly tested, and the average by four
different assays was 17dwt. The nearest battery is
17 miles away, and, as it is not a Government affair,
the owners of the mine had no say as to when
the stone would be crushed; moreover it does not
pay to cart anything under ounce stuff.
Diddle and Domney won 46270 z. from the stone
crushed, and instead of capitalising some of their
profits and turning it into machinery and further
development, they inyested in Perth property and
are now retiring. So it is scarcely putting it fairly
to say that the May Queen is being “given
another chance.” The Perth crowd is merely having
a go at it, and it is quite possible that in 10 weeks’
time (the battery should be ready by the end of
July) sufficient gold will be won to pay for the
whole of the machinery, and the dump will keep
the mill going while further development is being
carried out. Another point to be considered is that
Diddle and Domney have left at least 600 tons ore
blocked out, and it should average 2oz. per ton. The
shoot is certainly short (160 ft.), but it averages 3ft.
wide. Very little prospecting work has been carried
out, and it is the intention of the present co. to
give this matter early attention.
* * * *
Geo. Beard, manager-of Mt. Isa Mines
( N.Q.), is on a visit to Sydney. He reports
developments on his group as favorable, par-
ticularly on the Black Star, where cross-
trenching has exposed a width of 50ft. to
60ft. that will probably, with the included
country, average payable values. The work
shows 15ft. wide of solid ore. Careful
sampling of this development is in progress.
Mt. Isa South has bottomed on an exten-
sion of the liio Grande lode at 70ft. ver-
tical, and has proved solid ore 12ft. wide, but
rather low in silver values. A bulk assay
of the full width went 32 p.c. lead and 15oz.
silver per ton. The ore is clean and free
from zinc, and silver values are probably
low because most of the ore is carbonate.
The South is also testing one of the large
ironstone caps on its leases. These are con-
sidered to have possibilities, as they may
be the leached caps of lodes lying beneath.
Chief-geologist B. Dunstan, in his recent
official report, says that it seems almost im-
possible, on the evidence now available, for
the lodes (1) not to continue for considerable
distances under the soil covering of the
plains, and (2) not to live to considerable
depths.

Australian Oil Corporation is at last mak-
ing a start sinking its first well, near Dunn’s
bore, in the Beaudesert district (Q.). The
co. is acting on Dr. Jensen’s advice, and pro-
bably several bores will go down to locate
a favorable structure. Jensen regards the
oil at Dunn’s as a true seepage, though a
slight one; but the occurrence lias been the
subject of considerable controversy among
geologists.
Developments on the 112 ft. level of the Mt.
Cobalt mine, Cloncurry (N.Q.), continue
satisfactory, sft. of rotten diorite and schist
carrying small veins of cobaltite. Stoping is
chiefly being carried out over this level, and
about 120 tons, averaging 20 p.c. concen-
trates, and worth about £2OO a ton, are being
extracted monthly. Several spots of rich
silver ore have been struck in the workings,
but they are too rare to make much differ-
ence to average values. The mill is run-
ning satisfactorily now.
Trade on the new Bowen River coalfield
is dull. The Consolidated mine is doing
fairly well with small northern contracts, and
the sugar season will swell orders. The
miners, anxious for a hewing rate to be
fixed, have agreed to 6s. 3d. a ton, which,
considering the size of the seam and easy
working conditions, is generous. A Oft.
section on the Garrick is now being worked,
but the co. is also sinking 400 ft. for the
Bowen seam underneath. Several bores
there indicate a working section of at least
12ft. of hard coal. The present seam is
rather soft, but is improving as the cover in-
creases.
* * * *
“Old Alluvialist”: The new Ristori deep-
lead, Allendale, near Ballarat, must be con-
sidered from the standpoint that it costs
anything from £50,000 to £lOO,OOO to get
an alluvial show on the div. list. Even then
blanks are as frequent as winners) New
Langi and South Langi have both spent more
than a hundred thousand without even- flat-
tering their followers. New Ristori is com-
paratively shallow, and in this respect has
a pull over deep mines like those at Ararat.
So far some potholes put in from 170 ft.
have given moderate samples of gold. The
big job is to get well under the lead, bore up
to drain the wash, and then try its quality.
E. L. Vince and the rest of the Ballarat
crowd know all about deep-lead work, but
they are not justified in promising that the
crosscut west will add a valuable reef to the
assets. Notoriously poor has been the
quality of every run of quartz, beside or
crossing the gutters. The verdict is that
they shed their contents, when they had any,
into the leads. Glenfine South gave reef pros-
pects, but what a waster it proved to be!
The best thing about New Ristori is that, as
deep-lead work is unpopular and cash hard
to raise, no attempt is made to boom the
show. The lead is being tested before even
the puddling machines are put up. This
is a reversal of the old policy.
* * * *
For five years a little Sydney syndicate has
been persevering with a gold proposition on
Bushrangers’ Mountain, between Portland
and Sunny Corner (N.S.W.), and has
equipped it with a five-head battery, pump-
ing plant, etc. Development, backed by a re-
cent trial crushing, has encouraged the syn-
dicate to seek additional capital to open up
the show, so the Wee Jean G. M. Co., Ltd., is
being formed to attract £lO,OOO in cor„tnbs.
The syndicate takes 20,000 fully-paid os.
shares and £2OO cash, and 40,000 shares are
offered. It is an unusual little float; no
brokerage is payable and the promoters
undertake to return application money in full
if less than 20,000 shares are applied for.
It is proposed to open out at 50ft., where
there is hope that pay-stone will provide
funds for further development and equip-
ment.

Old-timers and prospectors are continu-
ally predicting great things for the Gulf
country* in the wilds about 20 miles to the
north of Emmaville (N.S.W.). Prospectors
have been active in the rugged mountains,
and several promising shows have been un-
earthed. One claim was sold some time ago
for more than £4OOO, and the co. which took
it over has spent nearly £13,000 for no
startling results. Lately two prospectors,
Gibbs and Andrews, made a promising find,
and a well-backed syndicate is taking it over.

Rex Thompson, of the dredge-building
Thompsons, of Castlemaine (Vie.), is the
leading light in the Kampar River Tin
Dredging flotation, near Ipoh (F.M.fe.). A
co. in 150,000 20s. shares is to be registered
in Melbourne, 48,000 fully-paids going to the
vendor, Chung Thye Phin, in payment for
160 acres of pound ground in which
13,000,000 yd. are available. J. M. White,
of the Malaya Tin Corp., is responsible for
the boring chart, and check boring was done
by W. J. L. Smith. On the north boundary
25 acres more have been applied for, and they
should add two million yards. The 72,000
contribs. have been taken by Melbourne and
Sydney, mostly in large parcels.
Ratrut Basin (F.M.S.), which had a dis-
appointment last year with a new area that
failed to give the values claimed by the ven-
dors, is now floating a new dredging cm, the
Kundang, in the Selangor district. There
are 644 acres, and 416 bored average o4tt.
deep and are estimated to offer 12oz. for
23,113,000 yd. Capital is to be £116,666 m
20s. shares; vendors are to receive 44,0dd
paids, Ratrut takes 11,667 for its No. 2
dredge, and Ratrut holders are offered dU,ddd
shares at par, and a similar number are to be
allotted them fully paid. J. M. White and J.
Malcolm Newman certify to values and
yardage. » * *
Melbourne-owned Ronpibon (Siam) com-
menced dredging with its 100,000 yd. Ruwolt
plant in April, but has been ploughing
through tailings before nosing into solid
ground. For April 19 tons tin were won
from 57,000 yd. ( average 12oz. ), and for
May 30 tons from 69,000 yd. (0.971 b.).
Puddling equipment is being added to the
plant, and in a couple of months, when the
tailings area has been passed through, Kon-
pibon is expected to be a substantial pro-
ducer. Bores show values running up to olb.
South Aus. Oil Wells Co. announces that
it is erecting a rotary drilling plant with a
core barrel of the latest _ type used in
America. The preseht bore is down to 600tt.
and the new plant ought to be going in two
months at Caroline (S.A.), near the Vic-
torian border and on the Glenelg River,
where two “seepages” have been reported.
The report also refers to the use of an
electro-magnetic oil-finding niachine of Brit-
ish design. The instrument is claimed to be
-influenced by underlying oil-pools, and the
presence of water is compensated and does
not affect the readings. The principle of the
machine is based upon the detection of the
variations of the earth’s magnetic field. A
reading of over lOdeg. is alleged to indicate
the existence of “payable oil.” This read-
ing was registered near the present bore,
and is therefore claimed to have confirmed
the work of geologists Jensen and Lyne.
Waihi (M.L.) for the 12 months to De-
cember last put through 201,430 tons for
£361,154 of gold and silver. The working
profit was £114,739, compared with £34,302
for the previous year and £106,033 for 19-1.
After setting aside £21,855 for taxes,
allowing £12,081 for depreciation of
plant and voting £15,000 for mine develop-
ment, the net profit was £65,803. The direc-
tors distributed £49,591 in divs. Develop-
ment was not far behind extraction during
the year: 193,014 tons new ore were opened
up, and reserves at December 31 were 439,289
tons in general account assaying 345. 2d. and
250,006 tons in suspense, worth 355. Id.,
making a total of 689,295 tons assaying 345.
6d. In 30 years Waihi has given almost
14 millions’ worth of gold, and paid nearly
5J millions in divs.

“Lex” thinks even Governors have rights:
British communities have suffered for centuries
from illegalities which were endured for class
reasons The Corinthians, Mohawks, etc., of the
18th century assaulted the Watch, wrenched off
door-knockers, kicked tradesmen and kissed their
wives and fashionable England smiled fatuously
and ’remarked that high-spirited young men of
means could hardly be expected to restrain them-
selves to the drab conduct level of mere apprentices.
A survival of' this superstition may be identified
wherever a University Commem. is held. In Sydney

“p p” • Although the N.S.W. Gov-
ernment ‘ has had no luck with its
latest cure for drunkenness, yet the
scheme looked
businesslike when
two rooms were
comfortably fixed
up at the Central
Police Station.
What wrecked it
may have been that
the consent of the
patient was re-
quired, and inebri-
ates who wanted to
be deprived of the
pleasure of getting
drunk again proved
to be rare birds, or
disinclined to be ex-
perimented on in
th e> interests o f
science and moral-
ity ; anyhow, the
rooms have been
surrendered to the
caretaker. The
treatment was by
hypnotic sugg e s-
tioii, which enters
into most of the
schemes for curing
drunkenness. There
was a system to
which a previous
Government gave a
passing encourage-
ment. A journalist
with a bibulous re-
putation was one of
the few who sub-
mitted to it. Appa-
rently he received
some benefit; but
he used to say that
the whole basis of
the cure was the administration of
whisky, disguised as a medicine, with a
nauseating mixture which made the “patient”
sick. The association of the whisky taste
with sickness created an antipathy to the
intoxicant ; but although for some time the
journalist maintained the role of a “cdred”
man, the effect was not permanent.

that they were escaping froin the
tyranny of unsympathetic parents, and mak-
ing their way to a station belonging to an
uncle, whom they relied upon, as “a decent
sort,” to give them shelter till they were old
enough to carry out their matrimonial pro-
ject. The manager notified the police ot the
whereabouts of the youngsters, wno mean-
time stayed on, while the waitresses tell over
one another in their desire to touch the edge
of a romance by ministering to the runaways.
On the second day, the first having been dis-
tributed between meals, picture-shows and
sundaes, with a dash to the Zoo, relatives
arrived from a country town and reclaimed
the fugitives, who went so willingly as to
create the suspicion that their funds were
just about exhausted. But it will be years
before the girls in that hostelry cease to talk
of that “perfectly lovely” incident.

“Esmond” : British brass-liats weren t all
Elgoods in their estimate of Australian
troops. The best summing-up of the Dig-
ger’s good and points I ever heard was that
of an English major-general, to whose divi-
sion our brigade was attached m March,
1918. He said: “In military circles there
are two brands of discipline, A and B. 1>
discipline relates to a soldier’s behavior on
parade and in barracks, and I don t think
vou fellows can claim to be well-disciplined
in that sense. The A brand of discipline,
the kind which really matters in times like
these, is the discipline of the battlefield; and
in that respect you Australians are 100 per
cent, efficient. I am glad to have you with
me, because you hold the flank; and, believe
me, it is a happy general who will go to
bed to-night knowing that Ins flanks are
safe.” And then a Digger in the rear spoiled
everything by asking suddenly and irrele-
vantly, but quite characteristically, When

“Harold Hardupp” : In these days of fierce
business competition a birth notice is liable
to bring down on happy parents an avalanche
of literature from firms specialising in baby
foods, medicines, clothes, articles of furni-
ture and even land (“an investment tor
baby” is the appeal). Nor are the birth
columns the only ones that enterprising tin-
ders watch. A man who recently inserted a
“view mat.” ad. in the S. M. Herald showed
me some of the results, or, to put it more
accurately, the by-products. He had col-
lected a bundle of 37 letters: three of them
were from jewellers who specialise in engage-
ment- and wedding-rings, two from tailors,
six from house furnishers, one from a piano-
dealer several from vendors of lots m rising
residential suburbs, and a couple from m-
surance agents. But the gem of the colltc
tion was a hairdresser’s card. It was a really
thoughtful act to remind the would-be swam

5/6/’24) certainly looks an outsize in queer
names, but while searching the registers in
Narrabri (N.S.W.) I found a couple that
take some beating. Charity Oilstriker was
apparently one of a family who flourished
in the district for some years ; but poor Scan-
dalous Lankey, who was found dead at a
pub, was only known as a seaman, and his
birthplace was America. That was the end
of Ms record. He was not the only one on
the same register who was found dead at
a pub; it appears to have been a not unusual
ending 60 years ago. While on the subject
of these old registers, I find they often repay
perusal. I traced the history of one hectic
week in another country town. Billjim mar-
ried the girl of his choice on Monday, her
baby arrived on Tuesday, and the poor soul
died on Wednesday. Without a pause for
reflection, Billjim married his deceased wife’s
sister on Thursday, and her baby was born
on Friday. Unfortunately, the records are
silent as to Saturday, but it is difficult to
think that it was quite a blank. I have
worried ever since as to what Billjim did on
that last day of his Wonderful Week. Some-
times I see him laying-off, smoking a quiet
pipe with the old man down at the woodheap.
Other times I imagine him, like the hero he
was, going on the jag of his existence. Per-
haps he set fire to the house. There is only
one feature of the case that puzzles me. hlow
did he decide which girl wanted marrying
first ?

“T.P.”: “0.P.H.” (B. 22/5/’24) on the
English stationmaster who pulled a cigar
from Palmerston’s mouth reminds me of
schoolmaster Dimsey, a prominent social re-
former of the ’nineties, straightening up
Alexander Peacock, newly-made Minister of
Public Instruction. Alec, on the road home
to Creswick, puffed his cigar on the Ballarat
West station. A porter approached him.
“Sorry, sir. but Mr. Dimsey says you got
to put it out.” Alec roared his laugh, then
in its pristine glory, and complied. But he
was not to escape so easily; presently the
porter returned with a second message from
Dimsey asking if the Minister didn’t think
that “a man who makes the laws should
obey them” without having to be asked to.
Peacock bore no animus. Neither did Dickey
Vale, M.L.A., when the same reformer got
him fined £2 for smoking in a non-smoking
compartment, and telling Dimsey to go to the
Devil when he protested. Tait took
up the railways they tried the same game on
him; but he blew rings, studied the notice,
said, “Wal, I never saw the damn thing
befoah. Boy, take it down.” And that
finished the business.

“X.N.0.”: According to “Skipper” and
“Hennessy”. (B. 29/5/’24) the Army has
a toughish job to convict when it court-mar-
tials a man for desertion. The Navy does
it in a simpler way. In the senior service a
man becomes a deserter if he remains absent
without leave for seven days—the intention
of the defaulter does not enter into the
matter. Joining another unit under another
name would be difficult, as all ratings in the
Navy are drafted from barracks. In any case,
an absentee’s period of absence terminates
when he surrenders or is brought aboard any
of H.M. ships or turns up at any naval estab-
lishment - whatever. It will be understood,
therefore, that when Admiral Field stated
that a Certain number of men had deserted
from the Special Service Squadron in dif-
ferent Australian ports he meant no more
than that these men had been away for seven
days or more without leave. Actually, no
doubt, many of such rejoined before the
Squadron left, but they were still deserters.

“Trooper Ketch’s” one experience of a
firing party:—
One sunny morning in the High Veldt, during the
S. African disturbance, my troop-sergeant informed;
me —-in the disagreeable tone of one who, liking nif
as little as I liked him, knew that he was “putting
it over” on me—that I was to fall in without my
carbine at the end of the lines. In some mystifica-
tion I did so, and was then marched off with five
others through the frosty grass in the direction of
the Nth Cavalry Brigade’s bivouac, about a mile
from our own. A few hundred yards from where
their horse-lines extended along a gentle rise, we came
to a white Boer cottage shaded by a clump of
eucalyptus, and at the foot of its devastated potato-
patch a sergeant’s guard “stood easy” near an open
grave. Beside the grave was a wooden chair, and
eight or nine paces in front of' it six Lee-Metfords
lay on the ground In line. A few soldiers loafed
about the doorless and windowless farm-house, and
an- officer’s pony was hitched to a wacht en beetje
bush at one end. It began to dawn on us that
something unpleasant was to be the outcome of the
queer expedition upon which we were engaged—a
forecast which was verified presently, when an ex-
ceedingly black kaffir, handcuffed behind, was marched
down from the house between a couple of Tommies,
followed by a provost-marshal and a surgeon. The
prisen’r was seated, with his back towards us,
straddle-legged on the chair beside the grave, and
on his jacket was pinned a piece of white paper in
the vicinity of his left shoulder-blade. We were
whisperingly directed by the P.M. to pick up the
rifles, which, he said, were at full-cock, to aim when
he gave us the order, and to fire when he dropped
his hand —he held a red silk handkerchief in it. It
was then that a furious resentment overtook me, in
which, I was informed afterwards, my colleagues
shared. I had not come to Africa to be a
hangman, I’d be if I would be one, and I
SHE HAD TWO.

would certainly send my bullet over the mute man’s
head. The rest of the disgusted firing-party after-
wards confessed to the same sentiments and inten-
tions, which, within the next few seconds, were to be
curiously modified and abrogated. In a half whisper
the P.M. gave us the order to aim, stretching out
his fist with the handkerchief in its grip, and I
sighted so as to clear the man’s left ear. And
then, suddenly, realisation came that the white-
faced sergeant of the provost-marshal’s guard, obvi-
ously sick and shaking, who stood with his revolver
drawn, was there to -finish our victim in case we
bungled the job—and I got my foresight on to the
patch of paper. So did the others, sni at the end
of a few long seconds the rifles crashed, and the
prisoner jumped over sideways, seeming to be well
and truly dead. We were ordered to ground arms,
and were marched back to our own brigade, in com-
plete ignorance as to what deceased had done. The
six Lee-Meftfords were loaded—none of us had any
doubt about that. What we had doubts about was
the parentage of those who had borrowed us to do
this dirty job.

“P.M.”: It was, of course, on Anzac Day,
1919—not 1918 (B. 29/5/’24)—that the
A.I.F. marched past the Prince of Wales
and Douglas Haig at Australia House. One
episode I remember vividly. Just outside
the main entrance stands a statue of Glad-
stone. An enterprising Digger climbed up
on the shoulders of the figure, put his Aussie
hat on the G.O.M.’s head and solemnly
raised it to each commander in turn as
he passed. I was standing between the
humorist and the platform, and I noticed
Haig watching him with one eye and trying
hard to smother a grin.
“T.P.” : The rejection of Wing-Commander
S. J. Goble, D. 5.0., 0.8. E., etc., as a
volunteer in 1914, on account of defective
vision, recalls a N.-E. Vic. sharpshooter and
bushman who was turned down for a similar
reason. He appealed against the decision,
and modestly pointed out that on one occa-
sion, with three shots from a repeating rifle,
he had picked off three foxes running on a
mountain side. “My man,” snapped an
irascible member of the Board, “men are not
wanted ovah there to shoot foxes!”

“Shed Hand”: A new railway can be
opened during the small hours of the morn-
ing just as well as in daylight. I was working
on the night shift of a metropolitan goods-
slied when a pair of keen eyes discovered
under a tarpaulin a number of cases of wine,
addressed to the Minister for Railways, Poow
Poow, where the new wheat-line was to be
officially opened a day later. A case of
bottled sunshine was smuggled out into the
transit-yard, and in the shadow of a rake
of coal-trucks we gathered round. One
barrowman was appointed bottle-opener and
another noise-smotherer, while the tally-clerk
became Premier and the stower Minister for
Railways, the last-named giving a rattling
half-minute speech on the backbone of the
country. I was the picker-out of the gang,
and, having a relative on the land combing
stumps out of virgin soil, was made Cocky
representative, and was on the point ot can-
ing for three cheers for the Government
when the official noise-smotherer rammed an
empty straw-envelope down my neck. i
took it as a hint that some person m
authority was prowling around. fetui,
didn’t matter —we’d done the job.

“D.F.”: Australia has not yet developed
any dialects, but certain curious differences
in the use and meaning of words may already
be noted. By way
of illustration, take
a couple of geo-
graphical terms
which are almost
confined to the
Speck. The appli-
cation of the. little-
used word “tier"’ to
ranges of hills
ing up one behind
the other appears
to be a Tasmanian
invention. Th e
best-known case is
the Blue Tier, in
the north-east of
the island, but
there are many
others Shannon
Tier, Ragged Tier,
Splitter’s Tier and
Brown Tier. Again,
the use of “bluff”
for a hill or moun-
tain which juts
boldly, though
common in Tas-
mania, is practi-
cally unknown on
the mainland. As
a rule, the word is
applied to promon-
tories jutting out
into the sea, such
as the Don Bluff,
Yellow Bluff,
Humper’s Bluff,
Ilellfire Bluff,
and Oakhamp-
ton Bluff. But the Barn Bluff, which rises
to a height of 4000 feet, is a long way from
the sea. The use of the word in a similar
sense is found in western U.S.A., where it is
applied to wooded heights rising out of
the prairies. But the Tasmanian use is quite
independent and probably older.

“Vanikoro” views his countrymen from the
knees downwards: —
Australia has been in a pre-eminent degree the
continent, of trousers. It is the only quarter of the
world that jumped at one bound from no coverings
on the legs of the male inhabitants to the full glory
of trousers. Europe had long ages of doublet and
hose and of knee-breeches, not to mention the tunics
and togas of ancient Greece and Rome. America
had centuries of the hose and knee-breeches between
the first coming of Europeans and the spread of
pants. As to Asia, though trousers are a very
ancient invention in the effeminate East, yet they
have had to compete with robes and other loose
effects. In Africa clothing in which trousers played
no part goes back to a period long before Tutankha-
men. Admittedly, the occupation of Australia by
white men fell well within the knee-breeches era, but
even in those early days the great majority of the
male population wore trousers. Perhaps the fact
that the first four Governors were naval men, and
QUITE ALL RIGHT.

THE BOSS: “Cert’nly not. She's engaged.”

that sailors were amongst the few trouser-wearers
of that day, had something to do with it. In the
requisitions for clothing for the assisted immigrants
of the early days we find that trousers were always
provided for them. For a time a minority went
about in knee-breeches, but not for long. Even to-
day the Australian affects trousers where English-
men, for instance, would prefer knee-breeches. Riding-
breeches, for instance, are a sure mark of external
influence; and so are the weird rigouts in which
golfers and some others affront the day.

G. C. DIXON, Melbourne Herald’s literary
and dramatic critic, and a Red Page
contributor, who has left for Eng-
land via Java, China, Siberia and Russia,
writing as he goes.
Col. R. Eccles Snowden, who takes over
the job of Tas. Agent-General from A. H.
Ashbolt, commanded the 47th Batt. in
France and took to munition work after
leaving the trenches. He was three times
Mayor of Hobart, and wore the bunny-
skins with aplomb when the Prince was
there. The Speck’s Agent-Generalship car-
ries only £lOOO a year, so the holder has to
spend a good deal of his own cash to keep
up appearances; but this will occasion Snow-
den no loss of sleep, as his draper father left
him well provided for. The old man, by
the way, _ was something of a wowser, but
the son is a racehorse-owner and a good
sport generally. He is an M.L.A., and was
for a few weeks Chief Sec. in one of Walter
Lee’s Governments, but had to make way for
another when there was a cave in the party.
The'very capable Cussen family put up pro-
bably a world’s record in the Vic. Supreme
Court the other morning. Allan Cussen was
admitted to the Bar on the motion of brother
Maurice, with the permission of the dad of
both, who is Acting C.J. .Tack, another son,
made the record as associate.
out in Melbourne last week, Albert
William Frederick Tocke, a barrister and
solicitor, whose shy reserve concealed sundry
engaging talents. After having been called
to the Bar in London, he went police-magis-
trating in India; then when his health took
a bad turn he joined the Pacific Phosphates
Co., of which his dad was a director. While
holding this job he collected much material
about the Pacific Islands, which he subse-
quently put into several articles for the
Argus. He did much other work privily
in drama and verse while practising once
more at his old profession in Melbourne.
Also he had a liking for the stage, and once
played small parts with Lily Langtry.
“Derf. Commor”: A name resurrected in
connection with the Mt. Isa (N.Q.) field is
that of Jim Elliott, discoverer of Mt. Elliott,
in the Cloncurry district. In the late ’sixties
Elliott was sentenced to 15 years’ penal ser-
vitude on a charge of robbing and severely
maltreating a Chinese on the Cape River
goldfield. He had served 10 years when
the real culprit confessed the crime on his
death-bed at Blackall (Q.Q.). Elliott came
out of prison a morose; man, keeping to him-
self, and .distrusting everyone. He went
prospecting, and occasionally spoke of a rich
lode he had discovered some miles from Clon-
curry, but he would never divulge the
locality. He died nearly 20 years ago, and
many think that Mt. Isa should be known
as Elliott’s Secret.
“Bathurstian” on a clerical matter:—
Dean Marriott, who died in England last week,
was a remarkable character in many ways. He
married tor the second time towards the end of his
incumbency of All Saints’, Bathurst, and was very
coy on the subject of his age. It was estimated
locally that he must have been nearly 80. For one
thing he was known to have been headmaster of a big
English grammar school 45 years previously. A
gentle, shuffling little old man, who avoided gazing
into the human eye and spoke in a high, querulous
voice, he yet wielded the hand of steel in the home-
made mitten of woo], as his bishop eventually found.
Bishop Camidge, a. large, hearty prelate with a tre-
mendous voice (local legend attributed its Carrying
powers to elocutionary lessons from Theodore Roose-
velt), was the antithesis of the Dean, but when lie
tried to take command of the cathedral funds the
latter defied him. For some time the Bishop, assisted
by his friend Canon Eyton, officiated at a small
tabernacle near the railway station, while the Dean,
supported reluctantly by the Rev. Gordon Tidy
(whose spiritual home was in the other fold), held
the cathedral trenches. The dispute was settled
honorably to all parties after a while. The Dean
went to Bathurst from Burwood in 'B2 and remained
in the pleasant job for 30 years.
Some changes in Brisbane River were wit-
nessed by John A. Dunlop, an octogenarian
Scot who died the other day after an acquain-
tance with its banks that went back for
over 60 years. Settling at Oxley, Dunlop
used to row to both Brisbane and Ipswich
to market his farm produce. In 1863 he
rowed from Oxley to Brisbane for his
wedding and took the bride home in the
same way. He was one of the first prospec-
tors for tin on the Stanthorpe field* and a
successful grower of cotton 50 years ago.
James Waterfield, who was found dead in
ms shack at Selby (Vic.) the other day, was
the son of the first Congregational minister
in V ic. the man who hobnobbed with John
Pascoe Fawkner and other pioneers. Water-
field prized his dad’s diaries, which shed much
light iipon the days when Melbourne was in
swaddling clothes. The Mitchell Library,
Sydney, now holds them. The son, who was in
his 71st year, retired from the clerical staff
of Vic. Education Department in 1913, and
indulged his taste for the simple life up in
the hills. It was the delight of the amiable
old bachelor to bring some former town
cronies up to his wee cottage and show them
how he could serve afternoon tea. He got
the call suddenly, and his shack was his tomb
for a week or more.
After 60 years of soul-salvaging—4o of
them in New Guinea--Bishop Louis Couppe,
ot the Missionary Order of the Sacred Heart,
whose Australian headquarters are at Rand-
wick (N.S.W.), has laid down the crozier.
During his IS cw Guinea period his mission
put the R.C. brand on 25,000 of our dis-
colored neighbors, and between whiles he, like
Paul of Tarsus, was thrice shipwrecked.
Also he had the unpleasant experience of
having spears poked in the midriff (five of
his priests were murdered by the Baining
natives about the same time—l9o4). The
veteran will spend the afternoon of life in
the country house of his Order at Douglas
Park (N.S.W.).
“Hamer”: The passing of Monty Somer
removes the third of a congenial trinity—
they have all gone out with dramatic sud-
denness within a few months. Alf
(“Widow”) O’Brien left for Melbourne in
apparent good health on a Friday, and died
on Sunday night after his return from a
boating excursion; Bede Carroll collapsed in
a tram, and was
dead before h e
reached hospital;
and Somer died
between his home
and his office.
O’Brien, as a pro-
vider of bands and
a promoter of
sports; Somer, as
the secretary of
the R.A.S.; and
Carroll, as a press-
man interested in
sport, had com-
mon interests
which drew them
together fre-
quently. The three
had been athletes
in their day, and
they were all
stopped suddenly
by the heart weak-
ness which comes
to so many men
whose early days
have been strenu-
ously athletic.
Colonel E. T.
LEANE, just
appointed Admin-
istrator of Nor
folk Island.
.1. W. Crickmore Flower, who died the
other day in Sydney, set out as a boy in a
300-ton barque to join an uncle already estab-
lished in Australia. On the voyage the vessel
was chased by a Russian privateer, and ended
by piling up near the mouth of the Glen-
elg, the survivors afterwards having to tramp
through the bush to Portland Bay. Flower,
who married the only daughter of Sydney’s
first pilot, Captain Kyle, became a man with
many pastoral interests, and was one of the
pioneers of the frozen-meat export trade.
G. F. Todman, who died in Sydney at the
week-end, aged 75, made a lot of money out
of tobacco; and he gave it away freely—•
£20,000 to the Western Suburbs Hospital,
£lO,OOO to build a new wing at the Children’s
Hospital, £30,000 for cancer research were
among the cheques he passed out. Like
most of the other men who ruled the tobacco
business in the eastern States 30 years ago,
he was a devoted churchman : his brand was
Congregational, but he helped many a young
man into the; pulpit of the Baptist and other
churches.
Mrs. Catherine Elmslie, who laid down
life’s load at her home at Flemington the
other day, was the mother of the late G. A.
Elmslie, Labor Premier of Vic. for 13 days
in December, 1913, and Opposition leader for
about three years. Born in the year Queen
Victoria came to the throne, Mrs. Elmslie
was a slip of a girl when she landed in Mel-
bourne 71 years ago. Two sons and a
married daughter survive her. The grave
claimed her husband and another son besides
George a few years ago.
Mrs. Margaret Falconer, who died in her
102nd year the other day, came with her
husband and four children to Sydney 71
years ago. He got employment with William
Randal, the for the first railway
—that to Parramatta—and lie was the first
stationmaster at Homebush, later holding a
similar post at Newtown, where he remained
until his death in 3885. Besides a flock of
other descendants the old lady left one g.-g.-
grandchild.
The other day the staff of the London and
Lancashire in Melbourne handed chief-clerk
C. H. Creswell some pieces of silver, and
said things about his tenacity in holding his
job continuously for 50 years. Creswell
was taken over with the old National Insur-
ance Co. of Australia when it was mopped
up by the hungry L. and L. 30 years ago,
and, now rising 70 and in perfect health, he
reckons on at least another decade of work.
He is one of the few insurance men who
topped off his education with a degree—he
is an Associate of Arts of Hobart.
Dr. W. H. Weston, president of the
National Dental Assoc, of Aus., which is to
have its triennial congress in Sydney in
September, holds both medical and dental
degrees. Although he practises as a den-
tist he served in the war as a doctor —and
got an M.C. and a “mention.” Though an
American, long residence has made him a
good enough Australian for his confreres to
give him the highest position in the dental
profession. As their president, he repre-
sented the Commonwealth at the annual
meeting of the Nat. Dental Assoc, of America
last year.
Lord Derby is known to have begun pub-
lic life with the same ambition as Lord Rose-
bery— to be Prime Minister and win the
Derby. He brought off one leg of the double
last week, when his colt Sansavino won the
great race in the rain. But his chances of
the other are now slim: in his capacity of
patriotic Lancashire native he is strongly
Freetrade, while all his other affiliations are
With the conservative Protectionists. He
Was Ambassador in Paris during the last
months of the war and afterwards, and,
though he made the French writhe when he
attempted to make speeches in their tongue,
as he often did, he was a great success, chiefly
because he had had no regular diplomatic
training whatever. He spoke his mind
bluntly, and Paris liked that, at any rate.
Vic. Parliament was for a long time without
any medicoes, but for the last three years
there have been three—Harris, M.L.C., and
Argyle and Fetlierston, M’s.L.A. Now three
more—Kent Hughes, Atkinson and Carnegie
—are trying to get in, and the knightly
Barrett will have a nibble, if he can. Given
five or six, their differences might provide
hvely ‘'copy.” A Barrett-Argyle tilt would
be worth sitting up for—the pair are not
exactly cousins.
Archbishop Kelly was anxious lately to
reward a trio who had been attached to St.
Mary s Cathedral for some years, so he put
the word through to Pius XI., who forwarded
three of the Crosses of Leo, a special creation
to meet cases of the kind. The captain of
St. Mary s bell tower, Bob McDonald, got
on ®; J; E. Burke, sec. of the Guilds, another,
and Mick Candrick the third. As the Arcli-
bish. is out to raise the cash required to
complete the Cathedral, there is more than
a hint in this investiture to prospective
workers in the neighboring parishes.
Darn ley Naylor, the handsomest and most
popular professor of the Adelaide ’Varsity,
smokes, goes to the kirk on North-terrace
every Sunday, puts half a crown in the plate,
and abuses anybody who is cruel to animals.
At Cambridge he took the classical tripos and
the Walker prize. For 11 years he was
classical lecturer and tutor at Ormond Col-
lege, Melbourne, and was afterwards vice-
master. Now he sits in the chair of classics
at. Adelaide. He loves English and Latin
idioms, and has contributed largely to the
Classical Review and the Classical
Quarterly. The League of Nations is one
of his hobbies; he can preach a good sermon,
is fond of music (his father was organist at
xork Minster), and lifts a fine tenor to swell
the hymns o’ Sundays.
E. T. FISK, managing director Amalgamated
Wireless ( Aus .), Ltd., of Sydney, who
had a direct talk with the Marconi
people at Poldhu, in Cornwall, the other
night.
Finished his last trip, Tom Savage, known
to successive Hawkesbury (N.S.W.) genera-
tions as Tom the Mailman. He had run the
mail between Windsor and Sackville Reach
for so many years without a stoppage that
the old hands have forgotten when he started.
However, one landmark was set in his career
over 50 years ago, when his leg was ampu-
tated with the aid of a butcher’s saw, and the
only anaesthetic available was the rum of the
period.
June 16 is the centenary of the S.P.C.A.
The founder was Richard Martin, M.P. for
Galway, who, in 1822, carried through the
House of Commons the Cruelty to Animals
Act, the first legislation of its kind in the
world. Martin was noted for the number
of duels he had fought, but was so fond of
animals that he maintained a private gaol for
the imprisonment of those of his tenants
who illtreated their beasts. He died in 1834.
THE OLD SEAMEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Along by the river and along- by the quay,
where fresh from the ocean conies a wind blowing
free,
The old men, the seamen, sit huddled up and wan,
A-thinking and a-dreaming of the days long gone.
A-thinking and a-dreaming of the old black ships,
Their whisker® a-wagging and the salt on their lips,
W ith eyes that are rheumy and sticks going tap,
Where the tarred ropes grumble and the grey waves
lap.
And ay! but they’re back again as they’ve been
before,
Their feet in the damp of a dajk fo’c’s’le floor,
Tacking up to nor ard in the flury of a gale,
With a wrenched hull leaking and a snugged-down
sail.
Only the quay is there, the wide river mouth.
But, ho! they are beating up again from the south,
The wind in the shrouds and the foam at the keel,
Soaring up aloft or straining at the wheel.
Now they're round the Horn with white sails spread,
Tracking up to China or glimpsing Java Head.
They’re fast at their moorings by the wee, white
towns ;
They’re lying off the Lizard or anchored in the
Downs.
Drifting on the Dogger Bank great sails in the moon,
The wind and the wash and the rigging all a-tune;
Rolling up to Rio on the arms of the sea,
Or down from the Hoogli with a hold full of tea.
With red lights and green lights getting under way,
W ith sea-boots and oilers that are glistening with
spray,
Sheeting home the top-sails, hauling down the jibs,
They’re swaying to the tremble Of the taut, live' ribs.
Rosy in the morning they swing with the tide,
Over from Belfast to the mast-thronged Clyde;
Blaring through the fog with the wind abaft the
beam,
Where the white gulls are wheeling in a world of
dream.
Whaling-ships from Hudson’s Bay and windjammers
full,
Coal-hulks and steamers and clippers stowed with
wool,
Slim fore-and-afters, barquentines and brigs
And creeping tubs from Persia with brown dates and
figs.
But now all the old men are sitting side by side,
Hearing vanished voices in the surge of the tide.
God ! There’s little left of hearty life to be,
For their lives are behind them in the long, lone sea!
Away past the bar steal the great grey ships;
They are watching them sail with their hearts on
their lips.
Oh, they can never go till the full tides are run,
Till the eight bells ring for their long watch done!
VICTORIA.
MYRA MORRIS.

“Alastor”: Salmon of Morinish, about 30
miles from Rockhampton (Q.), who has had t>o
yeark’ experience of snakedom, insists that the tiger-
snake has a pilot in a brown lizard which is about
lft. long and has a stumpy tail and short legs.
He swears that wherever this lizard is seen a tiger
is not far away. Even if the snake is not on view
there will be a hole in the vicinity, and if you dig
this out, as Salmon has dene frequently, John Tiger
will invariably be unearthed. When on the march
the pilot-lizard travels in front of the snake, and
gives warning when an unfriendly biped appears on
the scene. Salmon says this particular lizard pilots
only a snake of the tiger species.

“Winge’lr’: The other day Arrawingie
proved that the ethnoloigsts are really talking
through their hats. “My plenty savvy,” she said
when I asked her why her tribe ranged through all
colors, from the black of a newly-cleaned boot to
a pale ashy grey. “S’pose piccaninny come, him
mumma catchum plenty fat longa goanna, plerjty
charcoal knga burnt log; him rubbum baby all
over, makhm black-—black all same old log longa
fire.’ S’pcse him good feller mumma longa baby,
him rubbum all time longa charcoal. S’pose him
lazy-feller, him only rubbum little bit. Good
feller mumma gettum good feller black baby; lazy-
feller gettum baby only little bit black—might be
him yeller, all same Chinaman.” “And what about
white feller babies?” I queried. “H'm; him mumma
altogether too much silly feller. White feller no
more savvy any sing!”

“Bouragi" : Trial by the ordeal of poison,
mentioned by “Moe” as being prevalent in Dutch
ONE ADVANTAGE.
“Don't you Know that Hell is full of cigarette-smokers?"
“Must be a great place for cigarette-cards, mister."
New Guinea (B. 22/5/’24>, is or was practised all
over Papua and other islands of the Western Pacific.'
The Papuan brew is a herbal one, and is not prepared,
like “Moe’s,” from a deceased hero. One of the
many poisonous euphorbias is suspected as the origin
of the deadly stuff, though the Papuan Medical
Association keeps its secrets well. The drink is said
to cause the person on trial to vomit violently if
the dose is o.p. This is held to clear both his
reputation and his stomach; and all is well. A
weaker dose stops down and puts a painful end
to the guilty individual. The stuff is always pre-
pared and administered by the medico-sorcerer—
the professions are combined in Papua—and the
’guilt or innocence of the accused is dependent solely
upon the amount he or his friends can afford to
spend, just as sometimes happens in our own be-
nighted civilisation.
“Capta”: With shame I confess it—l have
murdered a wonderful mother. She was apparently
a lone widow, and when I shot her she fell limply
from her peppermint-bough domicile and exposed to
my sorrowful gaze five naked babies. Her name
was Mrs. P. Peregrinus—- Ringtail to her intimates
—and she must surely have put up a record with
her quintet.
* * » *
“Numbugga”: I can support “Brud” (B.
22/5/’24) re the aquatic ability of the boar, but not
so in regard to his fat sister or brother. On the
Kameruka (17/10/’97) some of us aboard the old
wreck had ample opportunities of putting the thing
to the test. Securing light lines to the hind leg
of a big porker we sent him over. He. had about
400 yards to do among the breakers, but the sea was
far too rough and he quickly succumbed. The same
fate met three more fats in quick succession. Then
my. eye lit on a thin old boar. Why they should
have consigned him to market the Lord only knows.
Anyhow, the remainder of our fine lines were attached
to him and overboard he went. Good old Dennis
did the trip, little by little, making temporary land-
ings wherever a tiny rock showed. In 50 minutes,
amid the thunder of mighty seas, the old gent,
climbed to safety, and when liberated from the line
trotted off to the scrub on Pedro Point. Though
Dennis had acomplished his part of the business,
however, the line itself immediately snapped from
the jags received among the rocks, and we had to
wait till other means provided a rescue.
“Adelaide”: Ever know a bird that took
an interest in pictures? Port Pirie (S.A.) has a
sulphur-crested cockatoo which studies an animal
book with real interest; as the leaves are turned 't
cackles at the portrait of a hen, moos at a cow,
neighs at a horse and at a dog’s picture screams for
Tim—the name of the family hound. Similarly, it
sings “The Wearin’ o’ the Green” on seeing a flag
of that color, the usual tune for the British flag
and “The Song of Australia” (S.A.’s local national
anthem) when the Australian flag is waved. Finally,
it can spell out its own name oh a rough wooden
typewriter made for the purpose. H. A. Johnstone,
printer, owns the marvel, and is always glad to put
it through its performance.
* * * *
“Callopus”: The other day I saw what
was to me a novel method of getting jibbing horse 3
to work. A neighbor was starting for market with
a vanload of pigs. The road from his front gate
is a stiff pinch for several hundred yards, and as
the air was keen one of the nags refused to get
into the collar, and its mate declined to do the
job on its own. Coaxing, profanity and the whip
all failed to get them to pull. Finally an acquaint-
ance happening along asked to be allowed to have
a go. Gathering up the reins he climbed out on
the pole, and, mounting the prad that started the
trouble, dug in both heels. The effect was instan-
taneous. Dobbin put every pound into the collar,
and the buckle-end of the reins brought his mate
along. They took the hill at a hand gallop, artil-
lery fashion.

“Homfrey Beale” : Before the advent of the
white man in Papua it was the custom amongst most
of the tribes to bury their dead in a central plot in
the settlements. The practice being dictated by affec-
tion it was hard to wean the natives from it. Magis-
trate F. Lawes, of the Central Division, was probably
the first to put both boots down heavily on the cus-
tom. In February, ’92, in a village of Freshwater
Bay, four bodies were buried one night just, prior to
his arrival. Although it was late
and the natives none too friendly,
Lawes strode alone to each of the
offending parties in turn, and, by
bullying and cajoling diplomati-
cally mixed, extracted a promise- of
removal, of the bodies to an area he
indicated. Next morning the
natives reported that the order
had been carried out; but the test
of probing the graves with ' a spear
showed that only one body had been
'’removed, the tops of the othe,r
graves haying been disturbed in
order to deceive. Lawes said 'lie
was sorry they had deceived him,
but knew they were tired the pre-
vious night and intended to begin
the work at once, and offered a pre-
sent to the one completing the job
first. He also, told the chief he was
sending a guard of honor of police
with a present that afternoon. The
old chief thought that remark out,
and when the police arrived all the
bodies had been removed. Lawes
kept his. word, the police carrying
a''liberal present of food, toma-
hawks* and ornaments. They also
carried another kind of present, to
be delivered had the bodies not beeh removed, and
had 4ny hostility been shown to their removal by the
police. Lawes carried on, and to-day the custom is
entirely abolished. Not one case of bloodshed occurred
over it.

“F.A.”: “Wessel’s” remarks rc the 1770
picture of the kookaburra, by M. Sonnerat (B.
29/5/’24), recalls ■ that the bird’s familiar, name ap-
pears very rarely in early works upon Australian
ornithology. In Captain Arthur Phillip’s “Voyage
to Botany Bay,” published in 1789, there is a par-
ticularly tine engraving by Stockdale of a bird,
unmistakably a kookaburra, which is designated
“The Great Brown Kings Fisher.” The concluding
remark may throw some light on “Wessel’s” sur-
mise as to how Sonnerat became acquainted with
the kookaburra, seeing that’ he visited only New
Guinea and not Australia. He says: “The species
inhabits various places in the South Seas, being
pretty common at New Guinea, but the specimen
from which our figure was taken was sent from
Port Jackson, in New South Wales, where likewise
it is not infrequently met with.” It thus seems likely
that in former years the kookaburra was seen on the
otner side of Torres Strait. The abo. name for
the bird differed with different tribes. Early- orni-
thologists give the Yass (N.S.W.) tribe the credit
for the nearest approach to the current name. These
natives called it “gogobera,” while neighboring
NOT A JOY RIDE EXACTLY.
PASSER-BY: “Is it true that old Sheepskins is dead?"
STREET LOUNGER: “Well, he ain't in the hearse for a joke."
Binghis used the abbreviation “gogera.” Dr. George
Bennett, in 1834, classified the wotd as derived from
the sound.

“7P.N.”: Long Jim, an old friend of mine,
owns sugar-land on the coast beyond Townsville
(Q.), and of late years he has taken to letting
it to tenants on very good terms, “Come for a
walk with me,” says he on the occasion Of my recent
visit; “I’ve a little business ter transact down
th’ crick.” As we passed out of the garden he
intimated he had “a bit er rent ter collect.” Jim
explained as we went along that he did a bit of
financin’ on th’ side. Last year, th’ season bein’ dry,
>..r had advanced his tenants sums up to £lOO on
ensuing crops at : a good rate, of interest. The
one we were on our way to see owed him a tidy
sum in rents and cash advances, “It gives ’em
confidence in you;” he said, “if they have a bit of
overdraft each year—they like ter feel they owe
yer a few quid.” I nodded. “An’ , when th’ crushin’
season is over I call round fer th’ rent an’ th’
loan an’ th’ interest.” I said, “Ah?” “Yairs,”
Jim said; “it’s like callin’ round ter th’ bank for
yer money.” We crossed a gully and came to the
residence of the tenant whom Jim was seeking. It
was a nice, neat little shack, with everything in
order, buj: there was no one about. “We’ll go over
th’ crick an’ see th’ neighbor,” says Jim. When wo
arrived there the neighbor, in loose cottcn attire,
was squatted on his hocks on a patch of hard sand
outside- his humpy cutting up a pumpkin. He
looked up as our shadows fell across the sand patch.
Jim jerked his thumb back toward the creek.
“Where ’nother man?” he asked. Ten, thousand
years of inscrutable mystery were in the, expression-
less brown eyes' of the other as he replied; “He go
China.”

“Werrimee”: Re bee-stings. Recently,
while eating some comb, lioney, I got a bee in mv
mouth, and it: left its, sting in the inside of the
lower lip—rather a tender place for the operation.
I .pulled the sting out, and immediately dabbed a
little honey on the spot. That stopped the pain in
a, few seconds, and there was no swelling. Thus
the bee supplies an effective antidote for its own
damage.

“Nugget” : Text-boobs state that the Aus-
tralian botfly deposits its eggs only about the chest
and forelegs of a horse; that the eggs are licked
off by the animal, and hatch in the mouth before
passing into the body for complete development at
the expense of the stomach tissues, and that on com-
plete development these star-boarders are carried
to earth, where they bury themselves for the pur-
pose of pupating. My own observations have, nbt
supported this theory. I got the impression that in
making an attack the bot always flew between the
nag’s forelegs and struck him between the jaws,
where • the eggs hatched of their own accord, ahd
that the young worked their way under the skin
to feed on the discharges caused by their irritating
presence. I have, at any rate, never found botifly
eggs on any part of Dobbin other than between the
jaws; and for obvious reasons he could not lick
them into his mouth, with the kindly intention of
incubating them. Horses with old scars cn the
part mentioned give evidence of the Australian bot
having developed along the same lines as his Euro-
pean cousin, who, however, attacks only the neddy’s
back. Can any of the Council explain whether
both species are found here, or whether the stomach-
inhabiting variety is capable of adapting its mode
of living to its position?
“Bad Australian”: I’m with “Adamascus”
and “Jimmy Possum”
in their contention that
the koala doesn’t drink
water. Years ago I
humped a theodolite
through the country be-
tween the Ovens and
Goulburn (Vic.), and in
those days there was
very little surface water
between the rivers, yet
the red-guni and box
forests literally swarmed
with the foolish animals.
Although I met thou-
sands of bears during
my protracted peregrina-
tions I never saw one
drinking or even on the
ground after sundown.
The koala, like the wom-
bat, never travels far
from the place where he
was born, and he is so
averse to the wandering
life that he frequently
spends weeks on the same
tree. “Suer e” (B.
15/5/’24) may have
scalped bears for his
bread and butter 30
years ago, but, all the
same he will find it
darned hard to convince
any old bushman that the
animals “come down to
the nearest water after
sunset,” or at any time
“to fill up to Plimsoll
mark for the next day.”
* *
“Hecagus”: Jack.v,
one of our niggers, had
had a bad break below
the knee and the wound
was mortifying. After
examining it one morn-
ing the doctor said, “It’s no use, Jacky—l’ll have to
cut the leg off.” The abo. was in a blue funk.
“Oh cripes!” he gasped, “that no plurry good to
me, boss; can’t you ringbark ’im?”
* * * *
“Ululah”; When that near-white young-
ster mentioned by “Centre” (B. 22/5/’24) gets his
second teeth he may do something out of the ordinary
with them; but at present he’s not in it with Joe
Snell, of Townsville (N.Q.). I’ve seen Joe bend
down, grip an ordinary pine-topped table (4ft. 6in.
by 3ft. 6iri.) in his tusks, then stand upright, holding
the table out in front of him, arid mean.vhile hitting
a gong on it to give the stunt a finishing touch.
On the edge of the table where he’d fasten his teeth
he would place a rag or handkerchief—riot to
protect his ivories, but himself from any subsequent
claim for damage to the table. And, talking of
freak performers, Jack Griffin, of Maryborough (Q.),
often for a wager butted weathe-boards out of
a wall with his bare head. A load of wood once
fell on him, and if any damage attended the mishap
it must have been the wood that suffered. John
certainly did not.
A FREAKISH APPETITE.
HIS DOILNG OWNER (to tramp who com-
plains of being bitten by dog) : “Well,
well, there’s no accounting for tastes.
And him with six lovely kidneys waiting
for his breakfast all the while!”
“Bouragi”: “Te Pana” (B. 22/5/’24)
dwells on the difficulty of getting the Maori to dis-
tinguish between r and l. It is still worse when you
g'et among a people who us,e. either indiscrimi-
nately, like the Binandelq-speaking tribes of .N.-E.
Papua. “Nasi dao loli” was an accepted phrase for
inquiring the name of a new village; but it went
just as well if one said “Nasi, dao' rori.” A native
would use 1 or r perhaps for the same word in one
sentence. For instance, I have heard a man say
“lili” and “riri” for bridge in the same breath,
and both “rarata” and “lalata” for “boys.”

THE RAIN ON THE ROOF.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Like, one who strokes the heated brow
With cooling hands, and bids man sleep,
It cools and comforts, mother-wise;
And some there are who close their eyes
And vision men that, sow and reap.
And some that hear it see in dreams
Wide fields of golden grain outspread,
Svnlit, wind-swept; and dreaming so
Forget their fears, their cares, and know
No worry for to-morrow’s bread.
What says the rain upon the roof?
“Unguessed, unmeasured is my worth.
Without me worm nor m:.n may live:
Life manifold ’tis mine to give:
I am the Mercy of the Earth.”

“Bouragi”: “S.C.’s” young dead leather-

could hardly have died of starvation, as he suggests.
Ko leatherjacket, of all fish, would hesitate to dine

off a mate, dead or dying. The casualties were
probably due to shock of some kind. It isn’t so
' ery long since what appeared to be a drifting
mine was reported between Sydney and Melbourne,
and one of these touched off would flatten out
any shoal within a half-mile. Warships occasionally
carry out target practice in those waters, and a
bursting six-inch shell could also cause the trouble.
Even the casual dynamiter might be responsible if
the shoal of little chaps was caught in shallow
water. I can remember seeing the beaches from
the Waria River to the Mambare, in N.E. Papua,
covered with all sorts of small and medium fish m
1903. A submarine variety of earthquake was blamed
for that.

“Centre” : .Like “Skyrider” (B. 22/5/’24.)
I have heard the nightingale; and,
while fully appreciating the beauty
of her song, must confess my prefer-
ence for the joyous morning carol
of our own magpie. Maggie’s notes
are pure liquid silver, mellow and
full, and to hear them in the early
morning, when the air is still cool
and crisp, is to feel an uplift that
no nightingale could ever give one,
sang it never so sweetly. Maggie
is a friendly bird, too, and responds
quickly to advances if made in the
right manner. I have palled up
with a couple who now come regu-
larly to my verandah-rail every
morning and accept my little offer-
ing of fragments of meat that I
place on the small board I’ve nailed
to the' top of the rail. They
always announce their arrival with
a burst of full throat,}’ song before
touching the breakfast, and ,seem to
accept my whistled reply as a
sign that all’s well. Lately they’ve
induced three of their relations to
come and share the snack with
them, so I’ve added to the allow-
ance. They fly to the garage roof
when the meaj is over, and from
there give my £ j-eal Australian ver-
sion of “Joy qf Life.” To keep a
magpie in a cage is needless cruelty.
You can tame the birds without
making them prisoners, and can
make friends with them without
keeping them behind wire-netting
or in bird-cages.
“Davrich”: “Werrimee’s” abos. who snared
ducks with pole and noose apparatus (B. 22/5/’24)
must have been well civilisation-tainted. A much
surer and quicker way is employed by wild abos. A
head-dress of reeds is made and fastened round the
operator’s neck. The reeds reach to about a foot
above the top of the head, and narrow eyeslits are
left —very narrow, for ducks are quick-sighted. Thus
arrayed the hunter wades into the river or lagoon
neck-deep, and awaits his quarry, previously located
making in that direction. Ducks are notoriously
curious, and invariably make for the strange islands.
As they come up they are deftly pulled under by the
legs. Their sudden disappearance seems to render
the remainder even more curious, and they crowd
closer till all are snared. In ’96 I saw an abo. get
27 in a quarter of an hour on an arm of the Narran
lakes. As he caught eacli duck he pushed its head
under a leather belt he wore round his waist. 1
have caught a few myself, but always bungle the
operation by making a splash and so frightening half
the menu away. Yet many whites are adepts.
‘Old Timer”: Re “Gouger’s” mate with
the feline sight (B. 15/5/’24). I knew a boy who
not only could see at night but had eyes like a
cat’s. They were yellow-brown and the pupils were
elongated. His face was long and thin, and he had a
couple of round grey spots of hair on his carroty
head. I lost sight of him years ago, but I wonder
if the front name of “Gouger’s” mate was Peter, as
his was.
“Te Babarantiko”: Now that mawkish
apologists for niggers’ cruelty have had their say,
it may interest all concerned to know, as evidently
some don’t, that even the obscurest island languages
and dialects have a word or words translatable
into “cruelty” or its equivalent.
* * * *
“Barwonite” : Re the argument as to
whether pigs cut their throats when swimming (B.
22/5/’24), I can tender evidence to show that some nigs
don’t, anyhovv. The case is famous out in the Gwydir
(N.S.W.), and is regarded as having settled the mat-
ter for all time. During the 1921 flood about 30
pigs at the Walgett slaughter-yards were caught in
the meeting waters of various rivers, creeks and
lagoons, and. left swimming in a sea about 20 miles
across in any direction. A passing voyager took
news to the owners. They constructed a raft and
28 hours later found the pigs still feebly clawing
the water amid a babel of strong swimmers in their
agony. They were got on board and a count showed
all present. A small percentage had neck wounds
from foot strokes. Owing to lack of dry land they
were all discharged medically fit to the brine-caslc a
few days later.
* * * *
“F.0.N.”: Tell “Parama” (B. 8/5/’24)
that his piece of ambergris, which he describes as
a lucky find, worth £75,” is not in the same pond
as the chunk taken out of the water on a beach near
Mackay (N.Q.) by Charlie Pagel, a local fish- and
oyster-merchant, in September, 1922. It weighed
251 b.;, and .his bank balance was bloated by £5OO
when returns came from the sale.
“G. 5.8.” : While I stayed at a farm last
week, the boss Cocky entertained me with a dis-
sertation on false teeth. “Look you ’ere, young
feller-me-lad,” confided the old chap for the’ fiftieth
time, “I got my teeth all yanked out 10 year ago,
an’ wouldn’t swap ’em back agen fer 50 quid.
Talk about ’angin’ on ter yer natural ones as long
as yer can why, if yer don’t keep wastin’ time
cleanin’ ’em the blasted things send yer nearly
crazy wi’ jor-ache.” “But don’t you have to clean
your false ones too?” I protested. “Of course yer
do,” he replied, “but they’re not ’arf the bother;
all yer ’ave ter do is ter spit,, ’em put now and
agcn, give ’em a rub on the seat uv yer pants—
an’ there yer are ! ”
* * * *
“G.8.L.” : Many Bulletins ago a discus-
sion as to whether Cook or Dampier was the first
white man to see the kangaroo was settled by
“Zanthus,” who pointed out that neither of them
was, as a woodcut of a marsupial appeared in a
work published in Europe about 1580. According
to the article on Australia in the latest “Chambers’s
Encyclopaedia,” it is highly possible that the animal
was observed lcng before even that date. The
writer, the Sydney man A. W. Jose, says “some
authorities declare that an allusion by Lucian
(a.d. 150) to animals that ‘use their belly like a
pouch,’ must have been inspired by sailors’ talk of
the kangaroo.”
“P.M.”: My newclium lad came into the
barn the other night gasping excitedly that a cow
had the waggon in her mouth and was walking
round tne yard with it. He didn’t appear to be
either mad or drunk, so I went to investigate, and
found that Strawberry had caught the hooked end
of the swingletree in her eyelid and had pulled
the waggon 25yds. by it. The eyeball was not even
touched, and the eye, though now slightly swollen,
is getting on all right, the sight being still O.K.
Another unusual feat was performed the other dav
by a neighbor’s cow. He put a bell on her, and
later found her hanging from a limb of a stringy-
bark. She had fallen over a steep bank towards the
creek and hanged herself on the tree by the bell-
strap on her way down.
* * * *
“Calaxias” : Oil the eastern side of Fores-
ter Peninsula (Tas.) a little stream rises under a
big rock and runs down to the edge of a 250 ft,
(“lift, over which it falls into a slight indentation
called Lady Bay. It is not a quarter of a mile
long, and the gully in which it runs lies between
the 2000 ft. Mt. McGregor on one side and the almost
equally high Goat Hills on the other, while at its
head a high ridge separates it from the creeks that
>un into Blackman’s River. Yet the holes of this
tiny stream abound with the little spotted, fresh-
water native trout (Galaxias truttaceus). The big-
gest specimen I ever caught (8oz.) came from this
isolated stream. How did they get there for a
start t they are a strictly fresh-water species, un-
like the related Galaxias attenuatus , which is found
in the brackish water of estuaries, and even if they
went to sea they could never climb the cliff. They
must have lived there as an isolated colony from the
time the configuration of the land was very different
from what itis to-day. But, then, the Galaxias are
an ancient family, since they are found, with very
slight differences, in South America as well as in
Tasmania.
* * *
Arilcumi : The poorest rich man-—or
richest pool' man I ever struck was a chap who
was working a claim on the Wauchope Crossing
wolfram field, a little sister of the Hatch’s Creek
field and 80 miles nearer the overland telegraph
line. He had a camel-string load of 70 p.c. wol-
fram on the road (worth between. £l2OO and
£1300) and about another £l2OO worth at grass.
He wanted a letter posted, but hadn’t a stamp
and couldn’t raise the penny for it (it was penny
postage in those da3's). After an embarrassing
approach to the subject, he managed to ask for
the stamp, and confessed his impecunious state. I
know it’s true; Dick Turner was his name, and I
was the bloke that handed over the stamp.
* * •* *
‘‘Country Ped” : Tlie Victorian freshwater
mussel is a übiquitous sort of person, it is found
in all fresh-water streams, channels and dams. How
it manages to get into isolated dams far removed
is a mystery to me, unless the aquatic wftding birds
pick up tiny ones with the mud on their legs and
feet, and so convey them to fresh quarters. Evi-
SHE’D HELP THEM TO KEEP
STRAIGHT.
MRS. PRIM ( about to engage a new cook) : “I
want you to distinctly understand now
that everyone in this house is a strict
teetotaller.”
APPLICANT : “That’s all right, mum. It
shan’t be me that’ll put temptation in
the way of any of ’em —I know what a
terrible thing temptation is, mum.”
dently the mollusc is a prime 'favorite with the
fresh-water rat, for where these cunning animals
abound the banks are usually strewn with the shells.
The rodent bites through just at the hinge, which
makes the parting of the shells a very easy matter.
THE LAND WHERE THE SUN GOES DOWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tell me, old Bill,” said the sun-browned child,
As he straddled the swagman’s knee,
Tales of the land where the sun goes down
And of wonderful things you see.
Are the houses all crowded side by side
Like the ones we have seen in town ?
Are there sheep and cattle and kangaroos
In the land where the sun goes down?”
The old man fumbled and found his pipe;
Put it back, as he changed his mind.
“There’s a town,” he said, “such a long way off
That it’s terrible hard to find.
Ihe track is rough and the way is long,
Theie are rivers and creeks to swim”
He patted the bush boy’s tousled head
As he snuggled up close to him.
And in the town there are wonderful shops
Where saddles are made for boys;
And ribbon- and doll-shops all in a row
Where little girls get their toys.
It’s always bright in the streets at night,
Very busy all through the day,
While shopmen stand at their doors and tell
Of the things they are giving away.
“No trains can run to that distant land,
For the mountains are bold and high’;
And right on the top you may touch the’ clouds
With your hand as they’re passing by.
Theie are no good roads where a cart may go,
So most of the travellers ride
Up hill by a narrow and crooked track
Through the scrub on the other side.
“The seasons are always good out there;
And there’s always a sward of grass
That waves as green as a field of corn
By lakes that are smooth as glass.
There are mobs of ponies, rolling fat,
For the boys and the girls to ride;
They learn to ride as they learn to walk,
And the little girls sit astride.
“Some of them ride on the poddy calves,
Whose backs are as sleek as silk;
And some of them buck like brumby colts,
They re so fat with the grass and milk.
And every boy has a catapult
That will shoot as straight as a gun,
Though no one shoots at the birds for sport
In the land of the setting sun.
“There are mulga apples all soft and sweet
And quandongs yellow and red;
The nardoo seeds —they’re as big as eggs
Make a wonderful kind of bread.
The emus lay on the open plain
At a spot that’s easily found;
And some of the nests of the mallee hens
Have a hundred eggs to the mound.”
“Tell me, old Bill,” said the sun-browned child,
“Of the needy old men with sw'ags.
Do they get nice flannels and dungarees
And a feast in their tucker-bags?”
The old man gazed on the keen young face
With its questioning eyes of brown •
He said “There’s a place for the old men, too,
In the land where the sun goes down.
HIS SERIOUS DAY.
SHOPWALKER: “What is your pleasure, sir?”
CUSTOMER : “Er- women, wine and horses, But I want
a black tie to-day for a funeral.”
“And many a weary man rests there
Footsore from a long, long tramp.
The sugar and tea and food are free;
There’s a place for his dog to camp.
There’s a spot that only the old men know
On the shady side of the town—
’Tis a Swagmen’s Home; and the beer is free
For them all as the sun goes down.”
Then hoisting his well-worn swag and kit—
It was more than a white man’s load—
He waved good-bye to the sun-browned child .
From the dust of the long red road.
Through hot, dry summers the bush child watched
For the man who never came back—■
There are bleaching bones and a rotting swag
Far out on the sunset track.

Another proof of the change in the J. J.
Garvan luck was given at Randwick on
Saturday, when his colt Houdini won the
Novice Handicap. Like his fellow-poloist
Colin Stephen, Mr. Garvan only races for
the fun of it; but he likes winning, all the
same. The afternoon was piercingly cold;
and most of the women who owned furs wore
them. Lady de Chair’s sable coat provoked
loud murmurs of envy, and so did Mrs. Tony
Hordern’s mink covering. The Cullen dame
wore sealskin, and Mrs. Herlbert Marks
affected a taking Kolinsky cape. Those who
spurned furs were mostly English, and hence
inured to climatic horrors : Irene Vanbrugh,
for example, looked quite cosy in a suit of
green wool, and so did Mrs. Pitt Rivers in
a wonderful gown which featured Chinese
embroidery. Both Exes, gave luncheon
parties. The G.-G.’s was the larger and more
festive, with Dion Boucicault and his hand-
some wife as the guests of honor. The State
Governor entertained the visiting English
railway experts. Amongst those in his party
were also the just-returned Esmond Friends
and the shortly-to-depart Mrs. Ewan Frazer.
She has transferred from the Queen’s Club
to the Australia, by the way, where she has
a brother from the country staying with her.
Chief Justice Adrian Knox will not be
sorry to visit London as a member of the
Irish Boundary Commission. His wife and
family are there, and he has let his house,
Osterley, in Macleay-street, to Mrs. William
Collins, of Queensland. Further, the stern
call of Imperial duty will land him in Eng-
land right in the midst of the flat-racing
season, and as he has even more friends in
the Turf Club than the Temple he will pro-
bably tear himself from his judicial work for
Goodwood Week. He is the second Chief
Justice and the second famous sportsman
to be associated with Osterley. It was for
years the home of Mrs. Long, whose son Bill
Long, M.L.C., owner of Grand Flaneur, lived
with her there, and whose eldest daughter
married James Martin, C.J.
Freda Sternberg, who is stage-managing
Stefansson, has contrived to turn her charge
into a social lion, so far as Sydney is con-
cerned. The Tony Horderns, Pat Osbornes,
Ken Richardses and others of the sporting
set have attended faithfully at most of his
lectures; and as the University notabilities
—and more particularly that perfect stage
presentment of a scientist, Professor David
—have done the same, the front chairs have
provided an unusual blend of frivolity and
intellect. On Sunday Owen Cox had the
Davids, Lachlan Beatons and others to
lunch with the explorer at Castle Hill;
and the James Burnses asked a
party from Admiralty House to meet
him afterwards at Gowan Brae. In-
cidentally, this celebration was in the nature
of a swan song. . The Burnses have decided
not to make their home at Gowan Brae —
it is too far from Sydney, and the expense
of modernising the lighting and hot-water
arrangements would be enormous. So, in
terms of the will made by the late head of
the family, it is to be added to the colony
of Burnside Homes that already beautifies
the road between Parramatta and Pennant
Hills. And from whatever place good Scots
inhabit when they die, old James Burns is
certainly smiling his warm approval. It was
his dearest wish that Gowan Brae should go
to his church unless his family found the
idea of parting with it intolerable.
A note from New York tells that the new
color there is sunset—in easy language, all
shades of flame and tile-red. Yellow is seen
everywhere. Skirts are very narrow and
built on long, graceful lines. The newest
shades in hose vary from dawn to sunset,
and are worn above black patent shoes. And
there’s still another hair-cut for women—
the garcon.
If charity begins at home, in Sydney it
doesn’t stay there. The cheque from St.
Vincent’s Ball ran to nearly £l2OO, Mrs.
Swinson’s Fair at Turramurra netted just
on £llOO, and the Eynesbury F@te on the
same afternoon brought almost £2OO to the
District Nursing Association.
The State Excellencies had a crowded two
days in Goulburn, laying foundation-stones,
unveiling honor-boards and doing other
chores. After dining at General McNicoll’s
t‘ ie viee regnl party attended the Diggers’
Ball. This was held at the Arcadia Skating
Rink, and the hall was very beautifully
decorated. The supper-tables were blue and
gold Sir Dudley’s colors—find a miniature
ship was in the Viking’s section. With their
Dxes. the town’s mayor and mayoress had
their snack; so did Education Minister
Lruntnell and General McNicoll and his wife.
Cupid is keeping up with the times. He
has fitted himself with a new pair of wings
and is out after high-flying game. Last week
he bagged two airmen. St. Mark’s at Darling
l .oint saw the complete surrender of his first
victim, Leslie Holden, M.C. The bride was
Kathleen Packman, of Kogarali, and she flew
cloth of silver and two veils, the billowy
tulle one being anchored by a Limerick lace
beauty. Two bridesmaids added the sheen of
brocade frocking that was the gold and brown
of the busy bee. The Cavalier was the ren-
dezvous for congratulations. Nigel Love was
the other Mercury who laid aside his wings
in moth-balls and switched off the “Going Up”
signal to substitute the “Coming Home.”
The nice girl who promised to have his even-
ing mea ls ready is Phyllis Eloise Davey.
Vellum velvets and silver lace, the whole
frosted over by a veil of Brussels lace, were
the bride’s supports, plus two ’maids and a
trainbearer. Nigel’s cheerers were George
Sutton, of Melbourne, and John Love.
Tramway-superintendent Doran had a wed-
ding in his family the other morning—he
handed over second-daughter Lylie to the
care of Dr. Leslie Roberts, of Brisbane. Four
priests and the bride’s uncle, Monsignor
Doran, of Canowindra, tied the knot during
the Nuptial Mass at St. Brigid’s, Marrick-
ville. The pretty bride emerged from ivory
brocades and the usual veil and orange-blos-
som entanglements. Over 100 guests were
afterwards lunched at the Cavalier.
Nearly two centuries back Nano Nagle, a
woman whose name is still held in venera-
tion in Ireland, founded a congregation of
nuns, and 50 years ago Archbishop Polding
introduced a group of the sisterhood into
N. S. Wales. At the golden jubilee celebra-
tions at Wagga the other day the sole sur-
vivor of the group, Mother Mary Stanislaus
Dunne, received congratulations from the
various convents of the Presentation Order
of enclosed nuns in Victoria and Queensland
which sprang from the original foundation.
There is at present in the Manly Hospital
a young Cornstalk who should occupy a front
place in the next procession that marches up
the centre aisle of Sydney Town Hall for
Humane Society medals and certificates. He
is a 14-year-old named Arthur Carter, and he
is recovering slowly but cheerfully from ter-
rible burns of body, face and limbs. During
the Easter holidays a party of Manly lads
were camping in a 6 x 8 tent, which during
the night somehow caught alight—probably
from a spark from their fire outside. The
lads were sleeping side by side on a rug-
spread over loose straw, and young Carter
was awakened only when the tent was a roar-
ing flame. He managed to roll clear, but im-
mediately realising that his brother and
another boy remained in the furnace, he
plunged back again and succeeded in
pulling them out of it. Unfortunately
both of the rescued pair died from shock
and burns, and for weeks the rescuer’s own
life hung in the balance. Only skilful doctor-
ing, devoted nursing and his own pluck pulled
him through. And he doesn’t seem to be
aware that he did anything at all out of the
common.
This is Christina Ormiston, whose work
as Renee in the Mosman Musical Society’s
production of “The Duchess of Dantzic”
made such an impression that it might be
called a dent.

brought with
her a record of
prizes won in
the Windy
Islands’ musi-
cal competitions. Now she is studying opera
seriously with Fossati. Other successes have
been engagements to sing for the Parliamen-
tary Recreation Society (now we understand
those all-night sittings!) and the Orphans.
Sydney Jewry has been doing honor to
the venerable and distinguished-looking Rev.
Van Stavern, Rabbi of Wellington (M.L.),
who is on a visit here. Born at Bolsward,
r nesland, 75 years ago, his erect and strik-
ing figure belies his years. He was handed
r . care , , the Wellington congregation in
IS<<, and has remained, something of an
idol amongst it, ever since.
Isabel Ramsay Letham, an ex-Manly
mermaid, who was some time ago appointed
assistant-director of swimming at the Cali-
fornia ’Varsity (U.S.A.), has now landed the
job of director of swimming to the city of
San Francisco. The athletic young lady with
the boyish figure was the first of her sex to
exploit the big surf-board at Manly and Dee-
wliy, and the “aquaplane” in the harbor.
She went to America several years ago with
the idea of breaking into the pictures, but
found that distance had lent enchantment
to many aspects of Hollywood. So she took
to the water.
May Moore’s camera caught this picture

the Conservatorium on Monday night. At
nine years old the Castlemaine girl played
with charm
and power,

London she gave a concert at the Wigmore
Hall, and received as glowing notices there
as she got for her Sydney performance. Lady
Forster was a front-seater at Monday’s
concert; so were Gladys Teece and Mrs.
Albert Littlejohn, who as family friends and
admirers had worked hard to make the even-
ing a social success. Manager John Brown-
low looked after the business side.
Paddington Town Hall isn’t being left for-
lorn these fine jazzing nights. Last week
Riverview Old Boys held their re-union on
the favorite dancing floor of a former genera-
tion. Many well-known River names—
McElhone, Oxenham, Hughes, Macken,
McCarthy—were duplicated, not to say mul-
tiplicated, among the revellers, and represen-
tatives of the other Catholic colleges were
well to the fore. St. Aloysius’ was there in
the persons of the medical Morans, she in
daffodil velvets; the A. P. Burnses did the
honors for St. Joseph’s; and Mrs. James
Hughes and her bit of the B.M.A. enjoyed
the fleeting hour. President Anivitti
escorted his better half, in black satin and
sequins; and Mrs. George McElhone, whose
husband and W. H. Williamson were brack-
eted as joint hon. secs., as though they were
a new sort of Siamese twin, warmed her blue
taffetas with bands of fur. Scores of young
things kept the ball whirling, and ever and
anon were deluded into the belief that the
stairs, with their spreading palms and buxom
pink chrysanthemums, were a nesting-place
for two, only to retire hastily, not at all
agreeing with Mr. Stefansson that the
terrors the Arctic are mostly imaginary.
To-night (Thursday) the Wentworth is set
apart for the Shore (Church of England)
Grammar dance. Postponed from May be-
cause of the death of the school’s sports
master, there will be a thread of regret
running through the year’s rejoicings.
Pitt, Son and Badgery’s boardroom was in-
vaded by womanhood the other morning when
the Hon. Rachel Pitt Rivers, as president,
made tryst with the committee of the Singing
Ball. This is in aid of Iveera House, the
seaside enthusiasm of the Country Women’s
Association, and will be held in Polo Week.
If is expected that most of the teams fighting
for the Dudley Cup will come along to sing
about victories past and present. Mrs.
McMorran, who nobly led the Polo chanteys
last year, will, colds permitting, do so again,
and Mrs. James Ashton lias turned poetess
in the Cause, and after long consultation with
the Muse has composed a song bringing in
the names of notable players from the dark
days when Jersey and Carrington wore the
Imperial purple.
The profits from the Newingtonians’ fifth
annual foregathering the other night go to
help remodel the sports grounds of their old
school. Judging by the look of the Went-
worth, the cause is popular among the boys
and their best girls, for the ballroom and
the Palm Court bulged with dancers. The
College flag gallantly draped the balcony,
and the frocking was as colorful as a Spring
flower-show or an exhibition of cold-water
dyes.
An exhibition which was opened at the
Kodak Salon in George-street last Friday
morning by Mrs. Pitt Rivers consists of pic-
tures amassed by Mrs. Alfred Milsou, the
S. Australian wife of N.S.W.’s best-known
yachting man, during her recent visit to
England, and comprises work by almost
every front-rank photographic artist in the
Empire. F. J. Mortimer’s seascapes—there
are a couple of dozen of them —are alone
worth a visit to the show, and Fred Judge
has some exquisite bromoil lithos. of London
—notably a scene in Hyde Fark and one on
the Embankment. Other exhibitors are John
Anderson and Ward Muir.
The Australia now houses three well-known
Sydney families, all of them homeless. The
Claude Parburys have just arrived from Wir-
rian, which they had during the O. E
Friends’ absence in England; the Alec Hays
have had a suite there for some months; and
on the ninth floor are the Sep Levys, in rooms
from which all the hotel furniture has been
bundled to make way for their own things
The Levys are well used to hotel life. They
put in most of the war, when their boys were
in France, at the Carlton, in London.
The Palais Koyal helps one to measure the
size of the jazzing craze—it is on the trail
°L dancers of Australia,” and
offers prizes of £5OO to the winners. The
dances on which the contestants will be
judged will be the waltz and the fox trot.
The judging in the preliminary and semi-
final heats will be (of course) by public bal-
lot. The finals will draw their own crowd;
so for them the entrants have the right to
choose their own judges.
One of the big fixtures for July is the
Bankers’ Ball, an annual money-spinner for
Prince Alfred Hospital. The president of
this year’s committee is H. H. Massie, of
the Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney.
The National Council of Women crowded
into St. James’s the other night to listen to
Acting-Consul Hajuy lecture on his native
Czeclio-Slovakia. This the young man did
with great earnestness, pouring out a flood
of facts that submerged his listeners. He
read by the light of a torch, on a darkened
stage, the history of his country, from the
beginning of time up to the era of the League
of Nations. And of those things that some'
of us wanted to know—how they dress, what
they eat, their plays, their dances, and their
folk-lore, their artists and their writers —he
revealed not a word. The Havana band and
a girl with a pretty voice later on demon-
strated something of the Czecho-Slovakian
music.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Sir Matthew has been quite a lot to see Allan
Wilkie’s Shakspearean Co. For the first night of
“Winter’s Tale” his Ex. had with him the Stables,
the Alan Jeffrays, Mrs. Turner and Barbara Sisley,
and Private Sec. Saunders looked after them all. In
the big audience were the W. H. Wallaces, whose
pretty daughter was taking the part of a walking
lady, with her golden hair a long way down her
back.
“King Lear” also drew a big crowd, which in-
cluded the Murrays and Lloyd Williamses, Emily
Bulcock, Nell Graham and the Gillies and Percy Rea'y
matrons.
His Ex. went along with Mrs. Leonard Turner and
Private Sec. Saunders to hear Erie Hayne play the
fiddle and Esmee Dawson the piano at the Elite
Theatre. The Morrows and Cribbs, Carr Boyds and
Andersens, Beryl and Clarice White, Eunice Cochrane
and Leonard Francis were there, too.
Kathleen Hirschfeld staged a tea for May Beirne
at Lennon’s amid the fragrance of sweet-peas. Amy
Hall also tea-ed May at the same place, when the
bride-elect’s frock was of black with touches of king
blue, and the hostess was in navy.
His Ex. went with Capt. Turner to Ascot for
Stradbroke Day. The weather was bright and cold,
and among the pretty frocks were Mrs. Gilbert Wil-
son’s almond-green broche with floral silk facings,
Mrs. Arnold Weinholt’s sand and black, the Mayor-
ess’s black charmeuse and Mrs. A. D. Walsh’s blue
and black.
Nell Tully, who marries H. Mort on the 24th, was
the guest at Jim Brown’s dance at Merthyr, and Mrs.
J. E. Stewart poured Pekoe in her honor at tables
covered w 7 ith roses —there were also bridge tables
covered with cards. In the throng were the E. K.
Tully, Cecil Palmer, Leonard Turner, Feez, Darvall,
Lavender and R. J. McNab dames, Nell Tully, Hal
L’Estrange, Leith Graham, Elma White, B. and C.
Cadell-Garrick and many other pretty girls.
The Governor gave a weighty address before the
Country Women’s Appeal gathering. Mrs. H. J.
Fairfax, Mrs. A. J. Thynne and the Mayor also
spoke their pieces to an audience which included
archbishops, moderators, mayors and aldermen.
The Mayoress of Brisbane and the Tom Ryan and
Weller matrons fixed up a jazz afternoon at the Belle-
vue (lent by the Finnigans) for St. Joseph’s, at
Corinda. Yellow and white was the color scheme,
and nearly 400 jazzers rolled up. Little Brian
Lawrence was among the songbirds, and Win.
Macobo.v, from Cremorne; Mrs. Robert Bell and
Addie Cantwell also helped.
King’s Birthday saw the Brisbane Cup run at
Ascot, and so did Sir Matthew and A.-D.-C. Turner.
Among the dressers were Mrs. A. H. Whittingham in
paisley, sand and furs. Mrs. Cecil O’Beirne in navy
brocaded marocain wdth handsome furs, Mrs. Hollis
in blue and musquash, Miss O'Shea in ivory silk
jersey with envy-raising white squirrel, and Pearl
Unmack in sand with brown ’broideries.
Eunice Cochrane’s recital filled the Albert Hall.
She sang in pale yellow brocaded crepe de Chine:
Mabel Zillman, the pianist, was* in pink; and Lena
Hammond, who accompanied the star, wore black
with a panel of blue.

superfine cloth it is necessary to
spin the yarn to such fineness
that a mile weighs less than an
ounce.
Look for the Fox Trade Mark
which gives entire satisfaction
because it is backed by this
guarantee
Fox’s Cloths are all pure wool
and will not shrink or fade by
land, sea or air.

The Governor and Lady Stradbroke to-day
bid au revoir to daughter Charlotte, who
is off on June 12 for a few weeks in her
native fog, with a short halt in Maoriland on
her way. Lady Charlotte Rous inherits the
Countess’s willowy elegance and good looks,
but she is handicapped by a distressing shy-
ness which keeps her in the background at all
official functions, leaving her younger sister
Helena to support her vice-regal mamma.
Despite the boadcasting of a permit to wear
sac suits at the vice-regal lcv6e, the function
failed to draw the crowd, though official gold-
lace, horse-hair and ruffles were there in
abundance. The moistness of the weather
was politely blamed for the shortage; but
the finger of suspicion points to the growing
habit among Melbournites, from Toorak
to Collingwbod, of turning up noses at
purely formal functions.
Justice Cussen, now understudy to the
absent Chief Justice Irvine, wall shortly
attain the dignity of Lieut.-Governor. Lord
Stradbroke is preparing to have a look at
the Northern Territory, and will slip the
official chain for ten weeks.
Past Gallery students, presided over by
artist John Longstaff, had for their annual
revel eight long jazz-laden hours in the St.
Kilda Town Hall on Friday night and Satur-
day morning. That effervescence which the
artist hath and the Fitzroy push hathn’t was
not hilariously in evidence—maybe because
of the horde of Philistines who were allowed
in as financial make-weights. Although
billed as a Grand Opera Ball, only a few
were in. operatic character, most of the fancy-
dressers being in any old motley, the re-
mainder sporting ordinary evening togs. The
artists had brightened up the hall with a
clever blend of humor and art. Posters show-
ing Grand Opera slaying the Comics, Mamie
Watson burning at the stake, Seymour Hicks
being driven out by an opera star, and so on,
panelled the walls, and there were banners
and balloons everywhere. John Longstaff
awarded, and Peter Kirke handed, the best-
costume prize to Win Frances, who had dis-
guised herself as the princess in “The Coque
D’Or.” Her head was fitted into the Daryl
Lindsays’ best dazzle-patterned tea-cosy, art-
fully disguised as a regal head-dress, with
a dripping of green ostrich feathers. W. R.
Coleman’s Eastern trappings earned him the
prize on the male side. Dr. Jack Ross Soden,
as a Cingalee, convoyed his medical wife,
who had encased herself in futurist pierrette
trouserings. Mrs. Teddy Dyson, as some-
thing out of Egypt, was swathed from head
to ankle in a white silk Oriental shawl, and
Mrs. Monty Grover was likewise Easternly
draped. The committee people were mostly
numbered among the plain-dress offenders,
but little Isa de Soyes fluttered pleasingly
as Madame Butterfly. Dora Wilson, Peg
Clarke, the Daryl Lindsays, Margaret
McLean, Jessie Traill, Jo Sweatman and
M. Withers swelled the art section of dan-
cers. Five hundred of the crowd stayed out
the revel, and even then many did not want
to go home at all.
Youth and beauty were at the helm when
Eleanor Hasell was made over into Mrs.
Brian Rosse Woods on Saturday afternoon
at Brighton’s St. Andrew’s. The job was
done by Canon Hancock, with the assist-
ance of padre Booth, who had chummed up
with the medical bridegroom at the Front.
The golden-haired bride looked like a fairy-
tale princess, in silver sheathings moored with
orange blossoms. Silvery lace hemmed the
edge of the rearward shimmer, while more
blossoms coroneted the tulle veiling (lent
by a Sydney aunt, Mrs. Clubbe), and a
bouquet of hydrangeas set off the silvery
background with a delicate blue. Sister
Dortge and Ella Ross Hewton (from
Tas.) ’maided, in shrimp velvet under droopy
little greyish-blue hats, ribbon-wreathed in
the two colors. Roy Johnston and Dr. Keith
Ross looked after the ’groom, while Dortee
Ilasell’s fianc6, Jim Cooke, and Dr. Holman
ushered the guests into the heather-decked
church pews. At the after-cheerio at the
Arthur Hasells’ Brighton home the host
played a lone hand, as his wife has not yet
landed back from her English trip. Dr. and
Mrs. George Woods came up from Geelong
to see their eldest hope assume his matri-
monial responsibilities. Mrs. Cooke was there
with her daughter; also headmaster Frank-
lin, Carl Kaeppell (one time of Sydney),
Mrs. Jack Gurner, Mrs. I)e Courcey Talbot
and daughter Lucy, Ada Krohn, Dr. Eric
Atchinson and his lately-acquired wife (she
was a Laidlaw), Dr. Moore (who described
himself as the bride’s very first acquaint-
ance), Fred Newman, Mrs. Brian Hooker,
the Fairchilds (they had motored from
Whittlesea) and the Perrins.
The Women’s Automobile Club mounted
its gladdest brocades on Thursday night for
the annual ball, a cheery affair, on Carlyon’s
orientally-tented jazz floor. A giddy out-
burst of swaying balloons splashed the side
wings of the hall with color, while toy hoot-
ers and such-like cabaret noise-producers
helped to liven things up. The popular club
president, who was chief constructor of the
shivoo, was attractive in black with blue
sequins, and she bore a hand shower of pan-
sies and maiden-hair as well as a mid-Vic-
torian posy of scarlet blossoms, both given
her by the ball and club committees. Shower
bouquets were also handed the two vice-pre-
sidents, Mrs. Ernest Cox (wife of the pre-
sident of the Australian Automobile Club),
who was in delectable draperies of filmy
mauve brocade, and Mrs. Felix Eloyd, who
sported an ermine-collared wrap over a smart
black-and-gold frock. Another club head-
light, pretty Mrs. Edgar Dye, carried black
velvet side-entanglements on silver sheath-
ings which were chained with shining paste.
Bertha Collin, who lias just joined the club
committee, was one-pieced in orange crepe.
Paper caps in the club colors, blue and
silver, were handed out as the dancers-in-
ordinary left; the Automobile section stayed
on for an extra —a scrumptious supper served
up at small tables glowing with chrysanthe-
mums bedded in russet leaves.
Kathleen Morton, who is learning the
business of soothing the sick at St. Vin-
cent's Hospital, East Melbourne, is carry-
ing round a half-hoop of diamonds which
signifies that she meditates matrimony with
F. M. Forde, the bright little member for
Capricornia in the National Parliament.
Forde comes from Rockhampton (Q.), but
his bride-to-be hails from Milbrulong, near
Wagga (N.S.W.).
A past generation of society frivollers
will be interested to learn that a Dame
Grand Cross of the British Empire has been
pinned on to Lady Willingdon, formerly
known in Melbourne as Mrs. Freeman-
Thomas. She is a daughter of the late
Brassey, and, with her husband, who was an
aide on papa’s staff, she kept depression
away from Government House during her
stay in Victoria. A bright, pretty woman
with an erect carriage in the hunting-field,
she subsequently figured in the sensational
grounding of the R.M.S. China in the Red
Sea. At the time of the impact she was
giving a party on board, and it was alleged
that the disaster was due to someone’s eye
straying from the compass to look at the
revel.
Violet Concannon, who smiles at you from
this Ruskin photo, is the Kalgoorlie girl
wlipm Melba
beckoned over
from Westralia
to step into the
grand opera
cho ru s. She
was born and
reared on the
g o 1 d iff e 1 d s,
where she has
been known
for the sweet-
ness of her
singing almost
ever since she
could toddle.
When t h e
voice was par-
aded for Dame
Nellie’s inspec-
tion some time
back, the diva
promptly ad-
vised its owner
to have it pol-
islied at the Albert-street Con., and accord-
ingly the modest little Kalgoorlie violet
was transplanted to Melbourne, where
she spent three years under Anne Wil-
liams, and, incidentally, amassed a
thorough musical training, together with
some useful _ stage experience in Fritz
Hart’s operatic productions. Melba’s sig-
nal the other day found her teaching in
Perth, but she promptly handed her pupils .
over to an understudy and hurried back to
this city and her grand-opera chance.
Charming Barbara Hoffe, the young Eng-
lish star whose twinkle was dimmed by
typhoid just as she was to make her first
Melbourne appearance with Seym ur Hicks,
made her belated bow in “Bain,” at the
Palace on Saturday night. She was accom-
panied by her ex-Welsh Guardsman husband,
Captain Oakshott, in the slender r6le of a
U.S.A. soldier man. She gets no chance to
air any sartorial wonders; but one does not
miss them. She opens out in a shimmery
white cr§pe one-piece with vivid scarlet
peeping from the accordeon-pleated skirt;
but the charm of her second effort, a pinky
check frock, is obscured by the rain-dimmed
atmosphere. A fleecy white wrapper confines
her graceful silhouette during the most
breathless moments of the drama, and there-
after she switches back into her wliite-and-
scarlet finery, which she tops with a coatee
and pull-on hat of paddy-green. The “house
full” sign was flown early in the evening.
Gaud Mayor Brunton and his wife decorated
one of the gilded pens, and Mrs. Brenan, who
never misses a Ward first night, was with
some pals in an opposite box. The Barry
Thompsons were in the circle; French Con-
sul Turck was stalled with daughter Ninette,
and Mrs. Seymour Dennis and Mrs. Max
Trythall was also sighted. *
Meet Vida Sutton, another young singer
who has appeared as the Shepherd in “La
Tosca,” as Martha in “Faust” and in
“Lucia,” “Cavalleria” and “Tales from Hoff-
mann.” She
was born in
Broken Hill,
and made an
early start in
her musical
career by
acquiring a
gold medal
from the
Royal Aca-
demy of Music,
London. Then
she came to
Melbourne, en-
rolled as an
Albert - street
Con. pupil,
and had her
talent trained
b y M ary
Campbell and
Dame Nellie.
The latter de-
clared that
Vida’s was a beautiful voice which should
awaken notable echoes in the musical world.
After appearing as a concert artist the
songbird trilled with the Verbrugghen
Orchestra and the Liedertafel, both here and
in Sydney, and more than once with the
Northcote Orchestra. During her Conserva-
torium days she starred in the name-parts
in Fritz Hart’s operas, ‘Tphegenia” and
"Olivia.” Ruskin made this photo of her.
A £6O cheque will drop into the District
Nursing Appeal fund from the bridge drive
in the Town Hall supper-room on Thursday
afternoon. This was engineered by the
Brian Hooker, Leigh Atkinson and Consett
Carre-Riddell matrons, and a big detachment
of the Very Nicest came along for a flutter.
Miss Michaelis gathered a bag of extra
shillings by raffling u complete outfit of
baby’s woollies, and a group of flappers
further weighted the takings with the sale of
lollies. Gaud Mayor Brunton earned sev-
eral hearty cheers by lending the room, and
his Mayoress gave a hand by taking a table. .
The afternoon tea was not allowed to break
in on a rubber, but was there when called
for. A solitary man heroically waded
through the petticoated sea, to make a
fourth at one of the green-baized boards.
Among the players were the Jack Menzies,
Frank Beggs (Western District), Edmund
Jowett, W. Parbury, A. Baillieu, Alfred
Bright, Frank Dobson and G. Falkiner
matrons, two James Barrett daughters, Beryl
Gatehouse, Betty Macmeikan and a Parbury
lass.
The Victorian Art Galleries housed the
Alliance Franqaise’s gathering the other
evening with nice effect. The programme
started with a reading of Molifere’s “Medicin
Malgre Lui,” and readers, led by Rene Van-
derkeln, deserve Iron Crosses for squeezing
every ounce of Molierian worth out of the
diverting comedy against the heavy handi-
cap of no scenery and no costumes. Then
came supper in the picture-hung vestibule,
and afterwards, with Gallic versatility, the
gathering broke into a vivacious foxtrot. The
French don’t believe in confounding culture
with dulness.
Mrs. W. W. Robins loaded her Hawthorn
parlors with autumn blooms on Thursday
afternoon for a talk over the teacups. She
was in black silk, with a dash of ecru, and
her daughter, Mrs. Norman Price, topped a
navy-blue crepe frock with a black velvet hat.
After the talk had warmed up from two-
somes to general chatter, the hostess and her
particular chum, the Tallis lady, announced
their intention of founding a canteen at the
Eye and Ear Hospital, where patients now
sigh in vain for a pick-me-up of tea in the
dreary periods of waiting. The pair are
conspiring to lay the financial foundations
of the canteen with the returns from a bridge
afternoon at His Majesty’s Theatre some-
time this month. As the guests promptly
chorused their intention of taking a hand in
the project, it is not likely to collapse for
lack of props.
Only that she is on a world tour, Mrs.
Edith A. Water worth, well known among
women’s health societies and the like in
Hobart, might have been the first woman
member of the Speck’s Parliament. At the
general elections she was only just beaten
for a seat. Now Snowden is retiring to
go to London the law says the vacancy is
to be filled by a scrutiny of the retiring
member’s ballot-papers. On these Mrs.
Waterworth would have an excellent chance;
but she would have to give her written con-
sent to be a candidate. A telegraphed con-
sent would be accepted if confirmed within
17 days, but as the lady is taking her hus-
band through America just now on the way
to Wembley, she will not bow to Mr. Speaker
in this Parliament. There are some mere
males in the House who won't be sorry,
knowing as they do with what caustic effect
she can talk.
His fellow-surgeons think that George
Syme richly earned his knighthood—that is,
if he, unlike his late uncle David, of the
Age, places any value upon the gaud. And
apparently he does, for he used the new
handle to his name the very day he got it,
as the scribes who sorted the cards at the
Governor’s levee noted.
Colonel Eccles Snowden, twice Mayor of
Hobart, who is to be the new representative
of the Speck in London, is a nephew of
Argus editor Cunningham. He is a cheery
Anzac, and his little wife shares his popularity.
Hats off to Mrs. Tudor, of St. Jolm’s-
street, Windsor, who, instead of wailing over
the disabilities of being prisoned in her bed
by spinal trouble, gives most of her time
to brightening the lives of others. For months
now she has been working to launch a Dollies*
Day in the Prahrnn Town Hall at the end
of the month in aid of the Salvation Army's
rescue work. The Dolly Lady has already
got enough to stock the hall, but, like old
friend Oliver, wants more; wherefore anyone
who would care to help her relieve the lot
of the people of the slums may send along
a doll. The other afternoon Toti dal Monte
responded to the call with a waxen beauty
dressed by herself, and the operatic star was
so impressed by Mrs. Tudor’s unselfishness and
cheerful heart that she reinforced her gift
with an outburst of song, which astonished
aud delighted the neighborhood.
That other Mrs. Tudor, the. late Labor-
leader’s widow, though a little better than
she was, is still very seriously ill. Feeding
by the mouth is often quite impossible.
The Society of St. George is engineering
a Cinderella dance, to be held in the Ormond
Hall on .June 17, in aid of St. George’s Inter-
mediate Hospital. On Thursday afternoon
president L. V. Biggs and his wife enter-
tained members and their other halves at
afternoon tea in Buckleys’ rooms with the
dual objects of letting everybody become
better acquainted with everybody else, and
making final arrangements for the jazz. Mrs.
Biggs hostessed in black braided navy tailor-
ings under an autumn-tinted hat, and the
teacake was handed round with a backing of
red, white and blue and the banner of the
tin-encased gentleman who killed the big
goanna.
Some gossip from Adelaide:—
Even a vile day didn’t keep racegoers away from
the A.R.C. meeting at Victoria Park. Lady Bridges
was in a grey frock and fuchsia-toned hat, and Mies
Judge in brown coat and skirt and henna -lid. One
of the smartest frockers was a youthful matron in
straight-hung brown, fawn-embroidered, topped by a
brown hat; and there was a navy coat-froek with
embroideries of red and green and gold that ran her
a close second.
All those who weren’t drowned in the violent
deluge in the afternoon were dancing on Friday night
—some at Boscobel, the Clem Hill home at Unlcy
Park; some at the Osborne Hall, with the old
scholars of St. Peter’s School for Girls as hostesses ;
the rest at the Methodist Ladies’ College at Wayville,
where old M.L.C. pupils did the honors. At the Bos-
cobel frjvol Mrs. Walter Smith, of Yalumba, and her
daughter-in-law, Mrs. Hill Smith (she who was Bar-
bara Bangs in “Healo”), were hostesses. Guests
were largely a replica of the “Healo” cast, and here
and there dresses were a replica of “Healo” froeking.
For the two school dances decorations were the
school colors (blue and white for St. Peter’s girls,
red and white for the others), with corn-flowers and
poppies to carry the schemes through. The season
has been a long time in waking, but now that it is
awake there will be little time for sleep between
frivols. June bristles with dances, and already host-
esses are scrambling for dates as far away as August.
While the younger generation dances the older one
is mostly money-raising—not for itself, but for the
hundred-and-one charities that have suddenly decided
that extra cash is essential. The “Blue Sisters” want
£7OOO to add a general wing to their hospital in
North Adelaide, the Methodists are after another
£7OOO for a maternity wing for their Memorial Hos-
pital, and the Children’s Hospital is reaching for
£20,000 for an out-patients department. As this
department put through 25 operations a year when it
was first built, and now has 625 a year with the
same accommodation, there seems to be something
in the plea that new quarters are necessary. The
Government has promised a pound-for-pound subsidy,
and committees are working hard to get the remain-
ing £lO,OOO from the public. One of the shows
will be a ball at the Palais, backed by a committee
of 40 or so of our best-known matrons. The mem-
bers of “The O’Brien Girl” co. will go along after
their show, and have promised a turn or two; and
the Bridges are also to be there. The affair is one
of half a dozen that are being run under the wing of
Mrs. Glover, the city Mayoress, other items of her
campaign being a street appeal, a house-to-house col-
lection in the suburbs, bridge parties, and a musical
afternoon at the Town Hall at which Clifford Lath-
lean’s mother will be responsible for the musical p,-o-
gramme and “The O’Brien Girl” co. will again lend
a hand.

WAX Your Linoleum
YOUR linoleum will last longer, look bet-
ter and clean easier if you polish it occa-
sionally with Johnson’s Paste or Liquid Wax.
It prevents cracking and blistering—brings
out the pattern and colour—protects linoleum
from wear —and makes cleaning easy.
JOHNSON’S
Paste ** Liouid - Powdered
POLISHING
WAX
Johnson’s Polishing Wax is the ideal finish for all your
floors. It will make them beautiful —easy to care for—
they won’t be slippery—and will not heel-print. And
Johnson’s WAX is, by far, the most economical finish
for floors and linoleum. With waxed floors expensive
refinishing is never necessary, for walked-on places
can be easily and quickly rewaxed as worn spots
appear, without going over the entire floor.
The easy way to wax floors and linoleum is with a
Johnson Weighted Polishing Brush. It spreads the Wax
evenly —polishes the floor easily—and is an ideal
floor duster.

SO THE JOB
PROPELY
As generally happens, the A.J.C. got a
heagre return from owners for the handsome prizes
it distributed at its June meeting. For six races
worth £6750 in added money, there were only 52
starters, and apart from Les Paddington, Clan
Robert, Chrysostom and one or two others, the
quality was poor—indeed, some of the competitors in
the jumping events were hardly worth the acceptance
money. Les Paddington (7’s), though burdened
with 351 b. more than the 9st. 12lb. he carried to
victory last year, outstayed the opposition in the
£2OOO Hurdle, Gindi and Clan Robert having no
chance with him over the last bit; but in trying to
add the Second Steeplechase (also worth £2000) to
his highly creditable record, he fell at the first
jump. Chrysostom, who has been very successful
at Randwick (he has had four starts for three wins),
annexed both races over the big timber, and was
twice second favorite at S.’s. Another double went
to Giggle (Absurd—Chuckle), who was backed from
15’s to 3’s in the First Nursery, and was friendless
at 12’s on the second occasion; and Farceur (Absurd
—Our Lady) was second in one handicap and first
in another. All three were bred in Maoriland.
Braehead and Trimacre were the best sprinters pro-
duced, the former running a close second (with lOst.
31b.) to the unbacked Naharadan and the Cooltrim
mare, who is to be retired to the stud, winning com-
fortably with 9st. 21b. up. And Polycletan, after
running poorly the first day, had no trouble in beat-
ing Note and Ulandra in the 13-furlongs Winter
Stakes. This is the fellow that downed Ballymena
in a middle-distance handicap at Moorefield the
week before the runner-up took the A.J.C. Derby. He
is a very uncertain customer, but good on his dav.
* * * *
Candidates for the Grand Nationals were
conspicuous at the V.R.C. Birthday meeting. The
most striking performance among the hurdlers was
that of Moogana (B’s) in the York H. R. ; he cut
down Bendoc and Silver San (both fancied for the
Flemington engagement on July 5) in most resolute
fashion, and carried 91b. more than his National
weight (9st. 51b.). Rahda’s success in the Marl-
borough Hurdle was also encouraging to his National
supporters, for Bronzillet was one of the beaten divi-
sion. Tarmoola (7 to 2), battling out a keen finish
with great grit, struggled home half a head in front
of the favorite, Irish Rufus, and Berribee in the
Hopetoun Steeplechase on Saturday, but two days later,
with another 31 furlongs to travel, Berribee (5 to 2)
was first and Tarmoola third. Berribee has list. 51b. in
the National (21b. more than he won with on Mon-
day), Irish Rufus list. 21b., and Tarmoola lOst.
91b.; and Berribee’s chance looks best at the moment.
The Monk did the Tye-Corteen-Godby alliance a
good turn by leading all the way in the £5OO Royal
Handicap, in which he was topweight with 9st. 4ib.,
and favorite at 9 to 4. Though a disappointment
in the Spring the handsome fellow has run very con-
sistently these last few months.
* * * *
A tidy swag of Queensland money was
transferred to Sydney last week, when Balaton won
the £2090 Brisbane Cup. Though last in the w.f.a.
King’s Plate on the first day of the meeting (Sere-
mite won it from Warwick Gun and Yacamunda),
the sluggish English chestnut was substantially
backed for the Cup, especially when it was seen that
Toohey had the mount, and 7’s was his price at the
start. The slushy track helped him to keep with the
field (in Sydney they nearly always went too fast
for him at the beginning), and, nicely handled by
Toohey, he was a head in front of the topweight,
Keremite, who was a neck to the good of the St.
Leger winner, Ardglen, after a rousing struggle along
the straight, Warwick Gun, the favorite, being a
close fourth. Munro rode Seremite, who put up a
gallant performance considering that he carried 9st.
51b., was conceding Balatcn 191 b., and was just
touched off at the finish of two miles run in ghastly
going. He may be worth remembering if he comes
south for the Metropolitan. Ardglen is evidently
another decent bit of stuff —after his Leger and Cup
races he took the £lOOO Moreton Handicap in the
gamest possible style.
The most-discussed horse of the season is
Stand By (Lanius-Comedietta). When in Sydney ?t
Easter the bonny black colt impressed some of the
Randwick watchers as a champion and others as
merely ordinary. Among the adverse critics was
veteran Bobby Lewis, who swore that wherever Stand
By finished in the Sydney Cup the plodding Drongo
would be ahead of him. As it happened they didn t
meet. After a brilliant performance in the S.A.
St. Leger, the black failed horribly in the Adelaide
Cup, and Dempsey, the jockey, assured the reporters
that he wasn’t much good. In the A.R.C. Birthday
Cup, however, with Veale substituted for Dempsey,
he met the same lot of horses —bar Wynette, the win-
ner at Morphettville—over the same distance (13 fur-
longs), and won like a good one, Imputation being
second and game old Paratoo third. Perhaps the
heavy going suited Stand By ; at all events he trav-
elled" more kindly for Veale than he did for Dempsey.
Those who stuck to him got 4 9-1 Q to 1 for their
money, and Imputation’s dividend was at the rate of
11 to" 4.

For the first time since 1787, Sir Peter
Teazle’S year, the Epsom Derby has been won by a
colt racing in the Derby colors. The twelfth Earl estab-
lished the race in 1780, and the seventeenth Earl got
second with Stedfast in 1911, with Archaic in 1920,
and with Pharos last year. Sansovino (Sw.vnford —
Gondolette) ended the long spell of misfortune; he
rounded Tattenham Corner with a good lead, and the
further the field went (there were 27 starters) the
more he gained. Weston rode the winner, who
started at 9 to 2 and took 2min. 46 3-ssee. to run
the 12 furlongs on sodden turf, and Bullock, the
Victorian jockey, was on the second horse, Lord
Astor’s St. Germains (Swynford —Hamoaze) ; Hurst-
wood, a son of Gay Crusader, who won in 1917, was
third.

In Victoria these days very little is heard
on the hustings about legalising the Tote. The Pea-
cock Ministry is divided on the subject, and, of
course, it isn’t in the programme. Morley, retiring
member for Barwon, is still the chief champion of
the implement, notwithstanding that his bill, intro-
duced in 1922, was thrown out by 41 to 15. That
a majority of the electors would prefer the machine
to McShortodds there isn’t much doubt, but no group
has thought it woi'th while to organise. So McShort-
odds feels secure.

Melbourne Cup nominations number 349,
which is a record, and 336 animals have been entered
for the big affair at Caulfield. The feature of the
rush for the Flemington prize is the strong conting-
ent from Maoriland. One of the projected invaders
is Nigger Minstrel, Desert Gold’s brilliant brothel - ,
and Ballymena is also expected to join the throng,
but Rapine will not be a starter this time. Neither
will David.
* * * *
“Lexo”: After having had the place-
machine for 40-odd years, Tasmanian racing clubs
have been allowed to run a straightout tote as well.
The thing was a success from the start. On the
first day winners paid 25 to 1, 12 to 1, 13 to 1 and
8 to 1, in ordinary fields, and now the punter who
wants to get a straight-out bet must make up his
mind early. The innovation will do McShortodds
more harm in a few months than repressive legisla-
tion and special constables would accomplish in as
many years.

“S.T.S.”: For the writer of the worst
sporting journalese in the world I confidently nomin-
ate Major Harding Cox, friend of King Edward VII.,
judge at dog-shows, M.F.H. and amateur jockey, who
is now publishing his reminiscences. Very jolly
reminiscences some of them are, but —an angry dog is
to the Major “this prototype of Bombastes Furioso.”
Fox-hunting talk is “the shibboleth of those who go
A CRIME.
THE ORAULE: “As I said to George Fuller,
I don ’ believe in them wheat-lumpers
bein’ compelled to carry those back-
breakin’ sacks.”
out' to harry Charles James.” A hare and a fox are
compared in this tortured style: “Artful and cunning
though ‘Charles James’ undoubtedly is at times, the
evolutions of ‘Tricky Madam’ have ‘The Gentleman
with a Brush’ beat to a frazzle!” A rabbit is “the
lively but odoriferous coney.” and hare-hunting “the
Red Currant Jelly business.” Scraps of foreign lan-
guages are everywhere, of course. Perhaps the love-
liest touch is that which calls miscellaneous classes
in a dog-show “the usual olla podrida of dogdom.”
Happily we have forgotten how to write like that xn
Australia; though I can remember a time when our
sporting writers loved to refer to the outsiders in a
race as “hoi polloi” or “canaille.”
* * * *
“Zwei-up”: I can’t quite agree with “Car-
tot” (B. 22/’5/’24) as to the chances the two-up
school offers to operators with a shilling or two of
stake money. In the first place, when much money
is about, the ringmaster, or players generally, require
a “show-down” from a newcomer; he must satisfy
them he is possessed of something worth having
before he is allowed to play. In the second, experi-
enced gaffers will not risk £lOO in a school whose
collective wealth might not amount to a tenner. But
I am convinced of the fascination of the game itself.
I know men who never attend unless in possession of
a sum which is likely to have taken them months
of saving to acquire; but who will do it in in one
session, satisfied they have received a fair run
for their money. One such (a foreman butcher)
I remember. His minimum was £75, and he- con-
fided to me that he could always “feel in his bones”
how much dough there was in a school. One Mon-
day he called me into his shop and recorded, jubi-
lantly, that he had headed ’em 11 times running the
previous afternoon. Asked how he had wound up,
he replied that he had left stony; but this was quite
a trifling incident compared with his remarkable run
of heads. Yet this man would not even toss for
drinks in ordinary circumstances.

Albert Lloyd (13st. lib.) is slow, but
Archie Hamilton (12st. 51b.) is slower, and after the
sixth round of their uninteresting dispute at the
Sydney Stadium, Hamilton couldn’t get out of the
way of Albert’s ponderous lefts and lights. He
stayed the 20 rounds, but mightn’t have lasted 10 if
the returned wanderer had gone in to fight. Lloyd
got the decision, and looks like getting back his
championship ci'own —not that it is worth much.
PARKIN, THE ENGLISH CAPTAIN.
Iu the course of nine days the N. S. Wales
Rugby League side has played four strenuous matches
and been overwhelmed with criticism, some of which
has been turned to good account. Having been twice
defeated by Queensland (in the second game by
2o to 7), the team made a creditable showing against
the Englishmen, who, after scoring 7 to nil in the
first ten minutes, ended with only 10 to 5. The burly
English foxwards wtre decidedly superior to the local
lot, so much so that during part of the game they
were content to play five men against six. Bennett,
a hefty and clever rake, gave the invaders a feast
of the ball. But in other respects they did not
come up to the expectations excited by the League
publicity experts, who laid on the treacle too thick.
Their defence was inferior to that of the Sydney
men, for whom Dawson and Blair did splendidly.
Gallagher (in the forwards) and Rix (a fleet winger)
were the most noticeable English pair. The goal-
kicking was nothing to write home about on either
side.
With Brogan, the Wyalong heavyweight, in the
forwards (Evatt was dropped), N. S. Wales got all
over the Britons in the return match, scoring 33
to 18. The change was due chiefly to accurate hand-
ling by the Blue backs and sounder work among
the forwards. Except in the opening five minutes,
when they ran up 8 points to nil, the Englishmen
were never in the picture; at one time the score
was 33 to 8 against them. Horder, playing one of
his old-time games, made opening after opening for
the winners, and Wearing (on the right wing), Ben-
son (half) and Brogan justified their inclusion. Ring
(winger), Carr (centre) and Brough (a clinking for-
ward) were the pick of the losers.
Estimates of League crowds differ widely, but it
is reckoned that there were 41,000 at the first match
and 40,000 at the second, whereas there were 55,000
on the ground when Queensland scored their two-
point victory over N. S. Wales. Parkin’s men were
plainly bothered on Saturday by the referee’s whistle.
He penalised them monotonously for off-side play, and
near the finish a couple of young players showed tem-
per, one of them (Ring) being sent off. A lot of the
whistling would have been rendered unnecessaiy by a
preliminary conference, as was here suggested. Again,
about half the team are suffering from influenza and
other ailments. Parkin himself is decidedly off-color,
Sullivan was unable to play on Monday, and Bacon
didn’t reappear after the first half, in which he was
hurt. In the circumstances, their prospects of lick-
ing the Queenslanders, whom they meet on Saturday,
are l’ather remote. No doubt they will improve on
their Sydney form, but they will need to make a very
decided improvement to have an even-money chance
against Australia.

“Past Grammar” : The Maoriland R. U. is
sending over a special team to engage N.S.W. in
July, though the men all belong to the All Blacks
who will tour Britain. Of those new to Australia
the fullback, Nepia, is most interesting. A Hawkes
Bay Maori, he is reckoned the best Enzed “full” since
Wallace, and, like him, is a great place kick. Robil-
liard, the second back, is a son of that Robilliard
who played for Canterbury Province in the 1890’s,
scoring two tries against Queensland in ’96 ; Lucas is
the Auckland centre and winger who shone against
N.S.W. in the Dominion last year; Cooke, a club
mate, is one of the best “stand offs” in Maoriland;
Brown and Hart, of Taranaki, are exceptional threes;
and Dailey is understudy to Mills, the great scrum-
half who visited Australia with the last lot of Maoris.
Of the forwards Murves was over here with the com-
bined M.L. Uni. teams. Though 14st., he is one of
the lightest men in the All Black pack. N.S.W. has
also found some good new blood, including Hill, a
fine forward from Manly, and Hingst, the Uni. break-
away against Beilis’s team in 1922.

By way of preliminary to the Australia-
Canada Soccer match at Brisbane, there was an argu-
ment between selectors and players. The former
had excluded Edwards, a right-winger, and most
of the Australians refused to appear without him.
So the selectors made a virtue of necessity, and
Edwards played. Australia had much the better of
the game, and won by 3 goals to 2.
Saturday’s two League games in Mel-
bourne attracted 50,000 spectators, who were re-
warded for braving the wintry weather by two of
the best games seen this season. Collingwood were
at home to Geelong, and went off with a smart lead,
holding it up to half-time. After that the Sleepy
Hollow experts woke up, played with better system,
and after a tremendous struggle won by a goal—ll
goals 16 behinds to ’Wood’s 10 goals 16 behinds.
There was an even fiercer battle at Carlton, where
South Melbourne started below their form and
looked in an unhealthy position at lemon-time, with
but 42 points to Carlton’s 52. But in the last term
the Red-and-Whites did their darnedest, piled on six
clear goals to Carlton’s two, and won by one goal—
-11 goals 12 behinds to 10 goals 12 behinds. So
strenuous was the —ex - —play in those last few
minutes that umpire Wickham called a halt and
addressed a few soothing remarks to the battlers. He
didn’t want to be mixed up in a case of man-
slaughter. On Monday Fitzroy downed St. Hilda by
93 points to 84, and Richmond had a narrow win at
Melbourne’s expense—B7 to 83.

Football in Adelaide is an uncommonly
level thing this season, and the excitement is in pro-
portion. When only two matches had been played
only two of the eight teams were left unbeaten,
West Torrens and West Adelaide ; and Norwood, pre-
miers of last season, had lost both times. But, with
five played, W.A. were nearly at the bottom of the
list, and W.T. second, Sturt having gone top, and
Noiwood started a recovery. The recovery included
a tie game with West Torrens, who immediately
lodged a protest against one behind scored by Nor-
wood midway in the game; the League sat on the
case for two evenings, but finally dismissed it. Now
Norwood have been beaten by Sturt in the finest
match of the season. An odd detail is that the goal-
kicking list is headed easily by a Glenelg man, yet
Glenelg have never won a game.

H. W. McLelland, of Wollongong, is the
1924-25 amateur golf champion of N. S. Wales.
Runner-up in 1919 and 1922. he gained the title after
an extremely close game with H. R. Sinclair, who
looked a certain winner at one time. Sinclair has
had more than his share of seconds; he was downed
iix the finals of both N.S.W. and Australian cham-
pionships last year.

Britain sprang a surprise on the prophets
last week by beating Spain for the second round of
the Davis Cup. But for the presence of Manoel
Alonzo in their team, the hidalgoes’ defeat would
have been a rout. Flaquer failed dismally in his
singles engagement with Wheatley, and the older J.
M. Alonzo, who was substituted, probably througli
sickness, in the other battle with Gilbert, captured
only four games in three sets. Flaquer and J. M,
Alonzo were also walloped by Godfree and Woosnam
in the doubles; but Manoel Alonzo ran home easily
in both of his singles, taking a love set from Wheatley,
who is rather fancied bv English tennis-writers. Bid
tain has now a great chance of fighting France for
the privilege of going to America. The French
squad, in which the youthful Lacoste was again
showing his ability to score in sti'aight sets, was far
too good for the Irish in Dublin. Of the other coun-
tries still in the running India is the most threaten-
ing at present. Sleem and Jacob put up a great
performance for India in eliminating the Dutchmen
without the loss of a match. The Dutch possess a
formidable man in Timmer, who has beaten Washer,
the best hard-courts player in Europe, but he didn’t
carry enough guns for Jacob, though he prolonged
the argument to five sets, and was only four games
down in the aggregate.

“Adelaide”: C. T. Studd, the Cambridge
cricketer who played for England in 1882, in the
famous seven-runs match won by Australia, has just
been heard from. The terrific strain of that tight
finish, when England went in to make 80-odd to win,
and failed, told on the younger players. It is a
matter of history that, while Lucas and Lyttelton
were keeping their wickets up, Studd was given
brandy in the pavilion by captain Hornby to fit him
for the ordeal. But he showed no sign of nerves
when he visited Australia with an English team. His
father was a prominent racehorse-owner, who was so
moved by the evangelist Moody that he gave up the
turf. C.T. himself has been a missionary for the last
40 years, and his wife is now in Adelaide, intent on
getting 100 young men missionaries for Central
Africa, and as many more for a new mission among
the Indians of the Amazon basin. I don’t fancy
her chance of finding them.
* * * *
“Tren” : I think the world’s cricket team
suggested by the London Evening News',' a good one,
despite “Bast Grammar” (B. 15/5/’24). Surely
Hobbs, Macartney, Gregory, Woolley, Hendren, Pons-
ford and Tate pick themselves. Fender, now better
than ever, is a good bowler, a fine hard-hitting bat
(he made the first century against the S’Africans —
102 in less than even time), a brilliant slipfield and
the best captain in England. Australians would pro-
bably prefer Kippax to Taylor (S’Africa), but the
latter has shown himself time and again the man
for a gi'eat occasion, while Alan has yet to be proved
in the best company. Challoner is in for his model
batting when on tour with the West Indians in Eng-
land last year. In first-class matches he made 1556
runs (five centuries), avei’aging 51. Every man in
the News team is a batsman; even Tate gets his 1000
runs a year. All are stars in the field, and with
Gregory, Tate, Woolley, Fender, Taylor and Macart-
ney. there is a splendid attack.

Twelve months ago, in the final of the
Vic. Waterloo Cup, Vanity Verse, a hot favorite
throughout, was unable to raise a gallop, her co-
finalist, Unie, being awarded the bauble, Unie ran
in the N.S.W. WatexToo at Rooty Hill last week. The
going was like smashed glass, and, used to softer
country, she tore toenails and stoppers about in gory
fashion. Nevertheless, she won course after course,
eventually getting a bye into the final. Heavily-run
and footsore, she stopped before reaching the hare, and
her owner (Dickie, of Bacchus Marsh) withdrew her.
Thus history repeated itself, except that it was Unie
who took second money at Rooty Hill. Lamb’s un-
beaten greyhound, Low Comedian, annexed the Cup.
but he had to go for his life to beat Shiela 8., who
was favorite from the call of the card. It was 16 years
since Lamb had captured a Cup, Lanoline having won
for him in 1908. He doesn’t get tired carrying them
home—the coursing enclosure forms part of his
estate.
EVEN BETTING.
[FOR THE BUKLLETIN.]
“Long hair is rapidly going out of fashion. In a
few years’ time every woman will be either shingled
or bobbed.”— Sydney Evening News.
Somewhere, sornewhen, she waits for me,
She does, as sure as Fate,
My preordained affinity,
My in juturo mate.
Her lines, although we’ve never met,
With mine are intermingled,
And though her mane, I think, is jet
It seems to be an even bet
Whether it’s bobbed or shingled.
What quaint ideas a fellow has;
Once I’d have risked a quid
Her hair would ripple round her as
Godiva’s tresses did.
That vision now I must efface,
O’er which I thrilled and throbbed.
Two types alone are in the race,
They round the corner, pace for pace,
The shingled and the bobbed.
It’s not a race, it’s just a match
Between a brace of quads ;
I only wish that I could catch
Some glimmer of the odds.
The bookies’ hoarse, insistent roar
In verse I’ve often jingled,
I wish they’d lay me five to four
She’s bobbed—whom I’ll one day adore—
Or take that price she’s shingled.
’Gainst fashion’s dictates who may kick?
Her head-thatch must be short;
Before my time arrives to click
There’ll be no other sort.
She’ll come, of woman’s radiant, rare,
And crowning glory robbed.
It’s even money if she’ll wear
Artistically shingled hair—
And even money bobbed.

Each and every day, if necessary, the
“Cletrac” Tank Type Tractor is
always on the job—no stopping for
sore shoulders —and when it’s not
ploughing, harrowing, pulling loads,
reaping and binding, it’s using its
power pulley for threshing, pumping,
sawing, grinding feed, etc. In fact,
there are no idle moments for “Cle-
trac,” and, above all, it runs economi-
cally on Kerosene. If you want to
keep ahead of your competitors you
cannot, afford to be without a
“Cletrac.”

“D. H. Robb": “Edward Denman” (B.
15/5/’24) is wrong: the Buffs are not the
oldest regiment in the British Army. The
oldest regiment of the line is the Royal
Scots or Lothian Regiment, the old Ist
Foot. Its number alone attests its seniority
to all other line regiments. The Royal
Scots are lineal descendants of the Scottish
Archer Guard of the kings of France of the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.
“Blanc”; Apropos military orders in the
Big Strafe. In December, 1917, the follow-
ing was read to us on parade:—
The practice of troops proceeding from the base to
thejr units firing at prisoners of war working along
the railway lines must cease. It is dangerous to
civilians, and two transport horses have been shot.
This order had no special reference to the
A.1.F.; it was promulgated throughout the
whole army, and the necessity for it doesn’t
make me think any the more highly of “civil-
ised” war.

be of some interest to prospective homicides.
A Mrs. Gemmell sued a well-to-do Wanganui
farmer who had been charged with the wilful
murder, and had been convicted of the man-
slaughter, of her husband. She asked for
£3OOO damages, and the jury gave a verdict
for £2OOO. Though a civil action always lies
in these and analogous cases, it is not com-
monly resorted to, perhaps because the slayer
is seldom worth legal powder and shot.
Wealthy assassins, however, would do well
to take the hint.
“Sturt”: An Adelaide workman has un-
successfully contested the claim of his recent
employers, the Simpson tinware co., for a
refund of the money spent on his passage
from England. His lawyer pleaded the Con-
tracted Immigrants Act of 1905, which pre-
vented workmen being engaged in Britain for
Australia, except by special consent of the
External Affairs Department. The co.’s law-
yer argued that this was obsolete since Wages
Boards came in; and the Court held that the
written agreement to refund was outside the
Act anyway, and was good. Verdict for
plaintiffs accordingly.
“G. Moses” : A Judge laid it down a while
ago that if a man bolts without permission
in another man’s motor-car, but says, when
captured, that he meant to return it, he is
innocent of stealing, even though he gives
no evidence save his word that he ever in-
tended to return anything. He may have
started from Armidale (N.S.W.) and be
almost at the South P'ole when stopped, and
still be guiltless if he alleges that he was
only going round the world and meant return-
ing the other way. If the owner cut him
open and produced his bad intentions on
the table of the court it might be evidence,
or it might simply cause a row. I have heard
a rumor that Parliament thinks of legislating
the crazy precedent out of existence, but I
don’t believe Parliament thinks of anything
at all.
A local record in fines has been piled
on to MacDonald, Hamilton and Co.,
the Brisbane shipping-agency firm, in
Port Adelaide, for letting nine China-
men come in as stowaways on _ the
steamer Manora, from Calcutta via Singa-
pore and Fremantle. The men got six
months each, pending deportation, and the
firm was fined £lOO for each of the nine.
Counsel admitted that the Court had no
option in the matter, but urged that the
Commonwealth should be asked to remit the
fines. As far as can be ascertained, no re-
sponsible officer even suspected that the men
were aboard —the S.M. was inclined to thmk
the ship’s Chinese carpenter had done th<?
business. He promised to report favorably
on a proposed petition for refund.
Arnold Weinholt’s send-off to another lion-
hunter :
At times there have been Abo. pars signed by one
Ben Johnson, of North-West Rhodesia. The Bulle-
tin will publish no more; for my.friend Ben John-
son has gone over the range. Though an English-
man and never in the Commonwealth, Johnson
always had a good word for Australia and Austra-
lians. I first met him at Sesheke, in Barotzeland,
not long after the outbreak of war in 1914. He
was then going as an intelligence scout for the
Rhodesian Government into wild country, on the
boundary between German South-West Africa and
Angola. Having just come in from there, I was, I
hope, able to give him a little helpful information.
Later we served there together as scouts, till the
German colony surrendered. Johnson eventually made
his home on the Quando River, in far south-east
Angola—a pretty lonely proposition, for the nearest
white men were on the Zambesi, about nine days
away. Though reticent regarding his own affairs, I
know he had been employed by the British Secret
Service. He served as one of the original I.L.H.
in the Boer War, and after that drifted about a good
deal in Central Africa, taking contracts for shooting
meat for various mines in out-of-the-way places. He
was a splendid shot, with the coolest of nerves, and
when I last saw him he had just shot his 27th lion,
all on foot, and mostly alone (that is, as far as
any white companion went). A handsome, middle-
aged man with a soft, almost drawling speech and
quiet manner, my friend was all kindness where
women, children or animals were concerned, but a
bully would mistake this manner and speech to his
cost. Only a few weeks before I last met him he
had been murderously attacked by a notorious ruffian,
one John the Greek, whom he promptly and justly
shot in self-defence. Johnson was well-read and cul-
tured, and short poems from his pen have appeared
in English papers, and articles, generally about lions
and lion-hunting, in Chambers’s Journal. During
the winter of 1923 I had made my main hunting-
camp about eight days (for porters) from his home,
and we exchanged friendly notes by native messen-
gers at intervals. I had intended to see him again
on my way back in October, but couldn’t manage it.
I am sorry novv that I did not go up for at least
one good day’s yarn, as he was then evidently grow-
ing very despondent. Some weeks later, becoming
more and more a prey to melancholia, he decided to
end his life. I have just heard what happened.
Sending all his boys away, he shot his few cows, his
small span of trek oxen and his old mule Biddy.
He then put all his belongings on his little Scotch
cart and set it on fire. When that was done, taking
off even his singlet, he committed it also to the
llames —and well I know his feeling that not an
article of his should ever be used afterwards by a
native. Stark naked, the poor fellow then walked
to a spot overhanging the Quando, leant over the
dark and crocodile-infested stream, and pressed the
trigger of his rifle.

“Sally” reappeared at Sydney Theatre
Royal for a brief season on Saturday, and
r{ * n her mad, glad way from the drudgery
of dishwashing to the roses and raptures of
captivating all hearts with dance and song.
Josie Melville returns as roguish and vivacious
and appealing as ever, and, it might be added,
as obviously unspoiled by success. The cast
contains a few changes. Dan Agar succeeds
George Lane as the Czechgovinian Duke and
comic waiter, and taps a rich vein of gro-
tesquery. Thelma Burness replaces Gracie
Lavers as Rosalind Rafferty, and gladdens
both the eye and ear. Noel Allen plays Blair
Farquar, Sally’s lover. George Gee, as Otis
Hooper, theatrical agent, scores his old quota
of full marks for quips and quirks and freak-
ishness, and Pixie Herbert, as the statuesque,
radiantly-attired Mrs. Ten Brock, retains all
her effectiveness. So do Reginald Roberts
(Richard Farquar) and Jack Dunne (Jimmie
Spelvin). What with fine staging, zippy
dances, gorgeous ballets and songs like “You
Can’t Keep a Good Girl Down” and “The
Schnitza Komisski,” “Sally” could retain her
grip on the public for many a day.
“Lilac Time” still lies as gently on the
spirits of people with musical tastes as tired
eyelids upon tired eyes—or the fragrance con-
jured up by the play’s title on receptive noses.
This is at Sydney Majesty’s.
The Vanbrugh-Boueicault season draws to
a close at Sydney Criterion. Since Saturday
“Half an Hour,” another of J. M. Barrie’s
three-scene playlets, has replaced the same
author’s rather depressing “The Will” as
curtain-raiser. There is more thrill and less
bleat in the new piece, which also gives Miss
Vanbrugh and Mr. Boucicault opportunities
of plumbing new deeps of versatility.
“Aren’t We All?” will rock the Cri. with
merriment for six more nights only.
** * *
At Sydney Opera House Seymour Hicks,
as “The Man in Dress Clothes,” continues to
spar for his tucker and to buffet his way
back to conjugal felicity with considerable
noise and gesticulation.

“Madame X” is in the closing stages of her

More Stefansson:—
The most challenging of Stefansson’s Sydney Town
Hall lectures was Thursday night’s—on ciimates. His
gospel is the economic future of the Polar regions,
and he wins believers more by his own passionate
beliefs than by the proofs he submits in support of
them. He holds in a general way that the worse
within limits a climate is the better it will serve
“LILAC TIME,” AT SYDNEY
MAJESTY’S.

(Arthur Stigant) to become merry.
the white races—provided it is stable in its atrocity.
He will accordingly go to the wilds of Central Aus-
tralia (Professor Griffith Taylor’s “almost useless’’
country) with a prejudice in their favor; he can
remember when other Taylors said Arizona was use-
less. (He fears the effect of Eastern Australia’s too
perfect climate, by the way, on the race.) But his
deepest enthusiasms are for those parts where man
has to go all out in the effort to survive. The
Arctic circle is already- being effectively settled. One
of his pictures shows a mixed herd of tame reindeer
and oviboes numbering thousands, and another a
homestead surrounded by a flower-garden that would
do credit to any city suburb in Australia. Both
were taken on farms within a few hours’ flight of the
North Pole. If Stefansson’s theories are correct the
future air-route from Britain to Japan will be via Nova
Zembla and Saghalien, or just half the present dis-
tance ; and on the way the travellers will pass over
some of the greatest food- and mineral-producing
areas in the world. He is not the best of advertise-
ments for the North Pole as a health resort in his
own person. He is rather frail, rather tired and
older than his years, and he has that air of gentle-
ness and infinite patience which mark those men who
have suffered for their dreams. Trappist monks and
pioneer settlers often have it; city bookmakers never.

ventriloquial sketch is clever fooling, Ruth
Astor’s impersonations are spirited, and
nothing tickles the ears of the groundlings
and the diaphragms of the gods more than the
song impressions of Ambrose Barker and
Peggy Wynne—especially when their har-
monious hilarities take the form of the kind:

“Conductor 1492,” at Sydney Lyceum, is
a dashing chaser of car-fares; but after
you’ve been told how he hooked a million-
aire’s daughter and saved her pa from being
outed by a business rival, you feel that your
leg has been stretched. “Shifting Sands”
supports the footboard warrior, and is an
epic of the desert, of fleeing wives and pur-
suing husbands and squealing flappers. The
Strand presents “St. Elmo,” a high-minded
young man who cuts short the life of a faith-
less friend, clears out of the country, and
returns to wed a blacksmith’s girl. The.
Globe still nurses its passion for forest fires:
the trick is worked again in “Flaming Bar-
riers.” “The Law Forbids” starts with the
judicial separation of the parents of a nipper
who in the last act re-joins the pair. Hoyt’s
is the address of the wonderful infant; also
it is the abode of Constance Talmadge and
Monmouth’s rebellion and a quantity of per-
verted history. “Rosita” shows no inclina-
tion to leave the Crystal Palace.
* * *
A one-woman Sydney show:—
Cumbrae Stewart strikes no definitely new note
in her pastels at Gayfield Shaw’s gallery in Callaghan
House. She is still giving much time to carefully-
rendered semi-nudes posed with studied circumspec-
tion in indoor lighting, but she has done some equally
careful portraits, still-lifes and a landscape. Her
work generally is marked by very sound drawing,
harmonious if unenterprising color and a fine appre-
ciation of the subtleties of flesh. But the most wel-
come thing is the hint here and there of a broaden-
ing of treatment and an accession of virility, which
suggests that the artist is at last tiring of mere
prettiness. Pastel is a dainty medium, but there
are fine possibilities of strength in it; and when one
so well equipped for the handling of it as Cumbrae
Stewart sets out to exploit those possibilities, some
really distinguished work is a foregone conclusion.
❖ * s’: $
“Rain,” at Melbourne Palace, is only a
modern variation of the old, old tale of the
anchorite and courtesan which Anatole
France described artfully in “Thais.” In the
present case a South Sea missionary strives
for the soul of an American siren who, in
the course of her conversion, arouses a pas-
sion he cannot quell. He struggles hard
with the coarse longing, returns to paw her
over while she is lost in holy meditation, and
then follows her crudely into her room. A
little later he celebrates his dishonor by
cutting his throat, and when morning dawns
is found dead on the beach. His lady love,
who has shed her sudden saintliness, then
resumes her former demeanor of challenging
giddiness and makes a date in Sydney with
a U.S. marine. The sordid yarn is staged
in a hotel-store in Pago Pago, where the
rain plays an infernal obligato to the tra-
gedy, and the desultory patter of Joe Horn
and other minor characters adds to the dis-
malness.

It is not a delightful vehicle for the Aus-
tralian debut of Barbara Hoffe, and it can’t
be said tliat she makes a great success of
Sadie Thompson. She looks angelically un-
real as the white-faced convert who is full
of hopes of salvation, and is only moderately
convincing when, shocked out of her
righteousness, she appears again as a dere-
lict titbit in smart holiday attire. The effect
of her Morning After, following the soft and
trusting Night Before, is garish. The feel-
ings of the Rev. Alfred Davidson are ex-
pressed in the routine baritone of the con-
firmed “heavy” by the veteran Jefferson
Taite. It is not his fault if the part is
rather absurd, but it could be improved by
amending the trousers, which concertina ridi-
culously about the ankles. Eily Malyon is
the depressed partner of the sultry missioner,
whose real trouble is correctly diagnosed by
Dr. McPhail, suavely acted by Frank Dunn.
Beryl Barraclough chatters intermittently as
Mrs. McPhail, and Brandon Cremer has a
minute or two as Bates, the quartermaster,
in the first act. Jack Kirby disguises him-
self effectively as Joe Horn, the trader, who
discovers in Nietzsche and the rum-bottle the
only possible antidotes to living with a
colored wife in a damp climate. Kirby’s
make-up is excellent, his plumpness is an
advertisement for the island food, and his
wheezy comment is all the better for a touch
of jocularity. Maurice Tuohy is a hatchet-
faced and twangy hero who has few chances
to score between the rainstorms and Jeffer-
son Taite’s loud communion with the Almighty.
Renee Glynn, in a gown made by Sacque
et Cie, doesn’t give short weight in the role
of Mrs. Horn, but some of the tinted inhabi-
tants who drift in out of the wet show a
want of confidence in the local hairdresser.

Though in the throes of last nights the
J.C.W. management has decided to squeeze
in one performance of the long-looked-for
“Don Pasquale,” at Melbourne Majesty’s
next Saturday. For once the reliable buffo
Gaetano Azzolini will have the name-part,
and Toti dal Monte, Dino Borgioli and the
brilliant Granforte will furnish a feast of
song in the other r6les. Next Monday the
season expires in a blaze of souvenir fare-
wells of “Faust,” “Tosca,” “Tales of Hoff-
mann” (Wed. matinee) and “Aida” (Wed.
night), ending with Dal Monte’s favorite.
“The Barber of Seville,” on the following
evening.

The Cherniavsky Trio revealed in their
opening programme at Melbourne Town Hall
on Saturday that they are an impressive
combination. Individually or together, they
captured the house, there being little to
choose in actual musicianship between Jan’s
fingering of the piano and Leo’s and Mischel’s
work on fiddle and ’cello. Mischel,
whose tone has acquired a rare breadth and
mellowness, ran from reverie to dance-time
in the charming Variations Symphonique
of Boelman. Leo obliged with Nardini’s
Sonata, through which he cruised with a rapt
air, though he was not unmindful of the
sparks in the first movement. Jan’s art
shone in the whimsical pattern of Chopin’s
Nocturne in E M a i° r > and added the
Scherzo in B Minor and a couple of other
delicate studies by the same composer. The
young man kept his big instrument in its
place in Beethoven’s long trio for piano,
’cello and violin (Op. 70, No, 5), which
started the entertainment; but his brothers
were equally notable in their reticence,
though contributing their quota to the
general achievement. The congregation
liked their arrangement of the Ave Maria
(Bach-Gounod), and there was a lusty
demand for encores when they dusted some
of the cobwebs off Boccherini’s Minuet and
made it almost a new thing. They give
their fourth evening concert to-morrow, but
on Saturday they must be content with a
matinde only, as explorer Stefansson takes
the floor at night.

Hoyt’s, Melbourne, are providing their sup-
porters with a few peeps into the jungles of
Papua. The film, which was taken by Cap-
tain Frank Hurley, is a notable bit of close-
up photography. Foremost amongst the
current fiction at the same house is “The
Dangerous Maid,” featuring Connie Talmadge
as a madcap super, in Monmouth’s Rebellion.
The Providence which watches over film stars
in tight corners saves her from the amorous
clutch of Colonel Kirk and a stretch of three
years handed out by Judge Jeffreys. A
magic rug figures in the oddly-humorous tale,
“Eden and Return,” at the Majestic, but the
Colt is producing some equally strange effects
in the latest celluloid version of “The Vir-
ginian.” Kenneth Harlan, the movie hero,
is more frowning and less debonair than
Charles Waldron, who originally did the part
in Australia. “The Midnight Alarm” is call-
ing Percy Marmont to the rescue of Alice
Calhoun at the Britannia; and Pola Negri is
emerging from “The Shadows of Paris” to
take her fill of the high lights at the Melba.
Hugh Ward’s experiment in reopening the
Prince of Wales’s in Adelaide has resulted
in packed houses for “The O’Brien Girl.”
Mamie Watson is as dainty as Maud Fane
used to be, but has not the same ringing
voice; in fact, the weakness of the solo
voices is the co.’s lame leg. Mark Daly
made himself an instant favorite; the Ameri-
can authors have given him some quaint
curses and other jests, but he gets a lot
more out of the part than they put into it.
Ireland Cutter and May Beatty play up to
lum well, and the vigor of June Roberts is
delightful. At the Royal the Forbes-Rob-
ertson co. is starting with “Smilin’ Through.”
and at the Majestic a big slice of the bill is
failed by Hurl and Evans with a Sunbeam
revue co. _ In pictures Betty Compson, at

From an Adelaide critic:—
Horace Trenerry, at 21, claims attention with a
one-man show at the Society of Arts. Like Heysen
he lives in a cottage in the hills behind Adelaide’
and, except for a few glimpses of Sydney Harbor, his
subjects are all found close at home. He is a quick
worker nearly everything shown has been produced
within the past 12 months—and a picture here and
there suggests that another day or so spent on it
might have been an advantage. But he has power

BOURNE HIS MAJESTY’S.

and a strong sense of the value of light, especially
as seen through gums. George Cowan, one of Adel-
aide’s generous collectors, opened the show; Van
Raalte, the Art Gallery’s expert, gave it his blessing;
and the public has shown a practical appreciation.
With this needed encouragement, Trenerry should
within the next few years be a real force in local Art.

With Norman Campbell's wreath: —
Harry Roberts, who died last week at a Sydney
private; hospital, had been: honorably associated with
the Australian stage for a generation. Slim, upright
and alert, he always looked younger than his years.
Playgoers spoke of him as “Maggie Moore’s husband,”
but he had a stronger claim on their regard because
of his histrionic ability. In his time he played
under most of the Australian managers,, in an aston-
ishingly wide range of parts. He was with the
Brough and Boucicault co. for a while in ’95, but
declined to take Arthur Dacre’s place on that actor’s
tragic death in November of that year—“too super-
stitious,” he explained. The Maggie Moore-Roberts
Co., which included J. P. West and James Athol-
wood, and had the late Harold Ashton as advance-
agent, then began its fairly long career. “Struck
Oil” was the trump card, and Roberts was an excel-
lent John Stofel, being particularly telling in the
dramatic scenes of the last act. He also specialised
in Irish comedy parts like Myles-na-Coppaleeu- and
Felix O’Callaghan. In ’97 the co. opened at~ Melb.
Royal in a burlesque of “Trilby,” then in the boom,
ALWAYS SO MANY FIRSTS.
“But don’t you think a man ever marries his
first love?”
“Never, my dear! It would be polygamy.”
with Maggie Moore in the title-role. Roberts was
an admirable Svengali, and the piece had a great
run. ; Subsequently Roberts went to America and re-
mained there for some years, appearing with Belasco
and other front-rankers; he also played in London
and the provinces. Returning to Sydney as lead in
“The Prince Chap,” he remained in Australia till the
end of his days, playing almost everything, from
panto dame to Shakspearean juvenile lead. His
last appearance was as King Solomon in a movie
prologue at the Sydney Town Hall. Harry married
Maggie Moore at New York on April 12, 1902.
“Norbell” : Maggie Moore will complete her
50 years’ spin on the Australasian stage on
August 1. Her benefit, already in course of
arrangement, should be the most momentous
stage happening for many years, and it has
an added sympathetic interest now that Aus-
tralia’s old friend has lost her husband, Harry
Roberts. All the mummers in the Common-
wealth will want to help. Nellie Stewart is
hard at work on a special attraction. “I'd
sell the boots off my feet for Maggie Moore,”
she writes.
"B.”: Melbourne playgoers regret the
sudden end of George Dawe, who played
in “The Squatter’s Daughter” for William
Anderson a few years back and more recently
was associated with the Pioneer Players.
Dawe will be remembered as a breezy sun-
downer in Louis Esson’s “The Battler” when
it was produced at Melbourne Playhouse, and
lie also served as an intellectual swaggie,
with a. leaning for tine literature, in
the same writer’s “Mother and Son,” at St.
Peter’s Hall, East Melbourne. The son of
a monumental mason, the dead actor had an
odd talfent for clay caricature, modelling
burlesque figures with an adroitness that de-
served to be better known. His widow, who
was also at one time on the stage, is a sister
of Judge Williams.
“Santander” : One artist who has not had
much of a show in the opera co. is Phyllis
Archibald, the English contralto. A mem-
ber of the British National Opera Co., with
numerous contralto parts to her credit, she
deserved more recognition than she has
received. _ She opened in Melbourne as
Azucena in “II Trovatore,” and the excel-
lence of her singing in an unbeautiful role
warranted the repetition of the opera once
or twice: but it was early withdrawn from
the programme. The same fate befell
“Samson and Delilah,” in which She was an
aMuring siren; and now her many admirers
can only see her in the final flutter of the
season as Amneris in “Aida,” which remains
on active service because it is a popular
draw. Many would have appreciated her
Carmen, which, next to Delilah, was her star
part in Britain.
• ' There * was a noteworthy produc-
tion of “Faust” a quarter of a century ago in
the old Melbourne Alexandra. Berthaßird, the
Marguerite, had a phenomenally high voice,
and sang some of the music an octave higher
than the composer intended. Louis Lus-
combe, a clever young Jewish baritone, was
Mephisto ; Rebottar®, who now teaches sing-
ing in Melbourne, was a fine Valentino. The
late James Ure waved the stick for a fort-
night of performances, and they invariably
got an encore for the Soldiers’ Chorus.
A dissertation on films:—
Some of the British moving-pictures shown at
Sydney Lyceum (B. 29/6/’24) -must have reached
Australia via the U.S.A.; they certainly were sub-
titled to meet that country's odd taste. All the
same. “The Grass Orphan” and “The Bohemian
Giii were .miles .above the Los Angeles average.
With a few exceptions, such as Mary Pickford, Billie
Burke, Hart and Will .Rogers, the Yankee photo-
player can’t act for nuts. No one would say that
of Margaret. Bannerman, , Gladys Cooper, Constance
Collier and Ivor Novello, who figured on the Lyceum
programme; . moreover, the interesting quartette
were much easier to gaze at than ,U.S. film-mimes
w ho are picked exclusively for their looks, which
looks are nothing to rave about, judged by’ British
and Australian standards. A few r Cockney charac-
ters were introduced in “The Grass Orphan,” and
after a prolonged course of ham-faced Benighted
States crooks, the honest, humorous Cockney coun-
tenance was wonderfully refreshing. Failing a regu-
lar supply of Australian films, our cinema-theatres
can do with a lot more British productions of the
sort made by Margaret Bannerman, Gladys Cooper,
Novello and Lupino Lane, who will probably rival
Chaplin if he gets the same chance. But Australia
ought to have a film industry of its own. It pos-
sesses all the natural advantages, as well as a great
home market; and as for the human material——well,
consider the number of Australians who have made
names for themselves on the other side of the
Pacific. Enid Bennett is reckoned a star at Holly-
wood, but I could mention a dozen Williamson girls
whom I would rather see on the screen than the
much too languid and self-conscious Enid. Imagine
a Williamson ballet alongside those vacuous and
stiff-legged females who do the cabaret stuff in Holly-
wood photo-drama! The Firm should be making
films - so should Hugh Ward. No doubt both would
if the Australian fiscal policy—not yet extended to
the movies—made it worth their while.
“D. ; Let me enter “Woman to Woman”
as an example of a film that ought to be
suppressed. Its heroine is a French dancing-
girl who meets an English officer on leave in
Paris, succumbs immediately, and has a child
—a boy. The man goes back to the Front,
gets shellshock (which causes him to forget
the Paris episode) and marries another. His
wife is really the villainess: she is a “society
butterfly” who meets her spouse’s moaning
demands to be “given a son” with angry
scorn. The tangle is straightened out by the
death of the dancer (from heart disease), and
the adoption of the boy by the Malthusian
wife. There is no single episode that will
offend the most puritanical, yet the cumu-
lative effect is to present a girl who has an
infant by a chance acquaintance as a highly
respected and materially successful character.
Both propositions are absurd in 99 cases but
of every hundred, but many young woifien
with the picture habit take the shoddy les-
sons broadcasted by Hollywood for gospel
A far-sighted seducer could not do better
than take the object of his designs to
“Woman to Woman.” It is a destructive cri-
ticism of two of the chief arguments that
have been used adown the ages to keep de-
fenceless maidens on the narrow path.
“S. Gumm”: At the Sydney premiere of
“Sally” the audience was detained by the
spectacle of an overwrought producer em-
bracing the leading lady. There was a re-
petition of this affecting incident when the
Ulimaroa brought the co. back from M.L.,
and the Sun did it justice:—
George Highland got excited to-dav....He pushed
his hat down over his eyes—tore into the street,
into a shop, jumped into a taxi, and was on the
wharf just as the vessel drew alongside. “My Jose-
phine! My Josephine!” A childish voice called back
from the thickly-lined deck. As soon as the gang-
way was down George Highland was aboard the
steamer. He was surrounded by the girls of the
company, but he could spare them little time. On
he went, the flowers being badly knocked about in
his advance, till he stood before a childish, pale-faced,
smiling girl. It was Josie Melville. With no
thought of the passengers who stood around, George
Highland forced the flowers into her arms, and flung
his arms round her and kissed her. “My million-
dollar girl!”
Fond fathers and devoted brothers not con-
THE HANGING COMMITTEE.
“Yes. but the cost of building is terrific, so my wall-
space will be limited. Couldn’t you give me a
little more picture and a little less frame?”
nee ted with the stage were greeting long-
lost daughters and other blokes’ sisters with-
out parading their emotions. But the feel-
ings of an elderly theatrical gent, on en-
countering a well-boomed member of his
company whom he hasn’t seen for quite six
weeks are incomprehensible to the common
herd. At the most tense moment a brutal
coal-lumper was heard to entreat his mate
to “ ’ave a screw at gran’puppa muggin’ the
little tabby in the fur coat.”
“Harold llardupp”: Some quick work is
to be put into the new St. James’s Theatre,
on the site of the old Girls’ High School,
Sydney. Twelve storeys are to be thrown
against the skyline, and the whole interior
completed, by December of next year. There
are really to be two theatres, one on the
ground floor and the other a “roof garden
theatre”; four lifts capable of holding 40
people each will help to clear the audiences
from the latter back to terra firma. The rest of
the big building will be let out as offices.
With David Jones’s new stores at the
Market-street end, and the Daily Tele-
graph premises on the King-street side, the
block should be the most massive in Sydney.
( “Caesar’s Ghost” : Before the end of 1925
Sydney will have three new theatres—the
Carrolls’ playhouse, whose blank back wall
stares at the Hotel Australia, and two in
Fuller’s new building; but the Criterion will
have gone. There should be ample room and
verge enough for the additions; 25 years
ago, when the Lyceum (now given over to
pictures), the Standard and the Alhambra
were in the business, the town supported as
many legitimate temples of Thespis as it
does to-day, although the population has
doubled. Vienna, with 1.800,000 people
against Sydney’s million (it is just on that),
keeps 49 legitimate theatres going, hard up
as the Austrians are —49 to Sydney’s five,
excluding vaudeville as well as pitchers. The
Viennese are not keen on pitchers.
From Piccadilly:—
Sutro’s “Par Above Rubies” has been withdrawn
by Marie Lohr after a very unprofitable run. “The
play is a failure, thanks to the newspapers,” said
the author bitterly. Marie Tempest, whose work was
the one bright spot in the production, has had np
luck since she returned from Australia—not that she
had much there.
Alfred Moul, formerly the bludgeoning musical
critic of Melbourne Age and afterwards manager of
the London Alhambra, left a tidy £24,356 behind
him, a lot of it to charities.
The Labor Government’s dramatic censor didn’t
take long to provoke remarks. Everybody has been
asking why A. A. Milne was ordered to change the
title of his new play, “To Meet the Prince.” Ramsay
Macdonald’s new man apparently jumped to the con-
clusion that the Prince of Wales was aimed at,
whereas the potentate referred to was supposed to
hail from the Balkans. However, Milne and his
actor-manager, Gerald Du Maurier, obeyed the order,
and the was re-christened “To Have the
Honor.” It is uncommonly bright and amusing, and
Madge Titheradge revels in the leading feminine r6le
—that of a grass-widow who recognises in the
princely impostor a former husband.
“M. 8.”: This is to inform “J. 8.” (B.
5/6/’24) that “The Mystery of a Hansom
Cab” has been screened. About 1909 I saw
a version at a little picture-show near South
Melbourne beach. It was photographed in
Melbourne, too, as I recognised St. Kilda-
road and Spring-street in it. I recall that my
scat cost me only 3d., which is evidence of
the remoteness of the date.
“Dido”: The equilibrist was up to his
tricks in Banvard's old circus at Wii-
carmia. He had piled table on
table, and having mounted the
structure was oscillating his
pedestal dangerously—or so it
seemed —and making the usual
pretence of being terribly afraid
of a fall. The oscillation had
approached that point at which
a catastrophe seemed imminent,
when a bushie hopped over into
the ring, seized the structure of
tables, and propped it perpendi-
cular'. “Now,” he said, “come
down and fix up your show
properly before you break your
neck!”
“George D.” : Members of the
criminal classes get some useful
tips from Yankee pitchers, par-
ticularly when the censor has
dozed. The Melbourne subbubs
have recently been shown how
illicit stills are run in the
American bush. First they
feasted their eyes on a party of
bootleggers gathered round their
simple apparatus; then they
were told the ingredients; next
there was a glimpse of the look-
out man at his post; lastly tin-
case with which an outfit can
be got rid of when the police
are sighted was methodically
illustrated. Obviously a new
outlet for the energies of high-
spirited young ruffians who
aspire to get their ugly mugs
in the illustrated section of the
Daily Garbagetin.
“Osric”: In the revival of “Madame X,”
at Sydney Royal, Jack Cannot is a bright
object-lesson as to why operatic and burlesque
comics should be kept out of serious drama.
It is a French play, the characters are French
people, and the venue is France. Yet Cannot
gags -and jars horribly—about wanting to
get away before closing-time, 6 p.m. “Let
those that play your clowms speak no more
than is set down for them.” There were Can-
nots in Shakspeare’s day.
“Second Murderer” : The amateur outbreak
of “Pinafore,” at the Conservatorium, Syd-
ney, on June 25-0, is being “produced” by
Fred England, surely the best man in Aus-
tralia for the job. Fred was with the
Montagii-Turner Opera Co. 40 years ago, and
has been with the J.C.W, Royal Comics
almost ever since they first staged Gilbert and
Sullivan. llis rich bass has boomed out as
Dick Deadeye to every Josephine Australia
has known. The Firm, not unmindful of
Fred England’s long service as a singer, has
found him a snug position at Sydney Royal.
J. J. 8.”; I can’t fix the date of Ristori’s
appearances in Melbourne (B. 29/5/’24),
but I saw her play “Queen Elizabeth” iu
Sydney on August 21 and October 21, 1875,
and on the former occasion the sleep-walking
scene from “Macbeth” was added.
"Sierra”: Great, is the appeal of sensa-
tionalism in pitcher-show advertisements.
This was evidenced in Sydney recently by the
women who swarmed to see “Condemned to
Death; or In the Shadow of the Gallows.”
The theatre entrance was fitted out as a
condemned cell, in which stood a “parson,”
open prayer-book in hand, and a manacled
convict. The subdued strains of an organ
wailing “The Rosary” floated through the
back gratings. Occasionally the spruiker
dodged behind the scene and tolled a mourn-
full death-knell, which sent a delicious
shudder through the crowd. The ticket-office
represented a riveted steel cage, through
the bars of which the women poked their
hands for tickets; and the thrill of that,
combined with the soul-tearing music and
the shivery effect of the tolling bell, was
better worth the money than the dreary
drivel exhibited inside.
THE ONE THING NEEDLESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is an opera. Anyway
It has some attributes
Thereof. The music’s light and gay,
And every person toots.
There is a big and pompous wife,
So very stern and true to life;
There is a husband thin and small,
M ho’s always worsted in a brawl.
There is a chorus slim and fair,
And ballets numerous,
A comic man who’s glad to share
His happiness with us ;
There is a prima donna, too,
Exceeding pleasant to the view.
Could I address the nice young thing
’Twould be in manner following:
I know you’re prima donna, since
You have the leading place,
And love the trim, untitled prince.
And I adore your grace.
Your talking voice is quite a treat,
Your dancing’s wonderfully neat,
No end of charms about you cling,
But, oh, my dear, how dare you’-sing ?

Converted Power to Man’s Use
TVTIAGARA FALLS, one of the wonders of the world, was
harnessed with alternating current by the master
craftsman, Westinghouse.
Nature’s power was bent to man’s will for his use. It
called for all the inventive genius of engineers sailing
uncharted seas. This achievement stands as a monu-
ment to posterity showing what can be accomplished
in subjugating the power of nature for the use of
mankind.

A Dainty Advocate of Mercolized
Wax for the Skin.
FOR A
BEAUTIFUL SKIN
Wash your face in warm water,
and while the skin is still damp
lightly smear a little pure mercolized
wax over your face and neck, and
leave on until the morning. After a
few nights of this treatment the
blemishes on your skin should dis-
appear.
Mercolized wax dissolves away
the old, dry skin and leaves behind
a new, healthy complexion. Beauty
is but skin deep—mercolized wax
brings it to the surface. It is empha-
sised that this wax is quite harmless,
and contains only the purest ingre-
dients, being free from any poison-
ous mercury salts.
The meaning of the word “mer-
colized is active, and its activity
is obtained from its oxygen content,
which is Nature’s own beautifier. As
a general facial cleanser mercolized
wax is unequalled, being in universal
everyday use by up-to-date, dis-
criminating women. Husbands also
find it beneficial for use after shav-
ing, especially if the skin is chafed.
It should always be used before the
application of powder, as the wax
will prevent the pores of the skin
from becoming clogged and un-
healthy.
All Chemists can supply you with
pure mercolized wax, in neat,,
original tins, containing sufficient to>
last from six to eight weeks. Price,
5/6 per tin, or post free from

CAN YOB DRAW?
You may think you cannot, but really
you can, for if you can write you can
draw; the same principles apply in
each. With the thorough tuition you
receive from the Weston Course, there
is no reason why you should not in-
stantly dash off free, bold sketches
similar to the one above.
THE HARRY J. WESTON
Postal School of Drawing
takes you step by step from the rudiments of
sketching to the highest branches of art.
The lessons are simple, interesting and effi-
cient.
Remember, we teach to DRAW not to COPY.
Learn more about the Course! Post three
stamps with your name and address, and you
will receive a copy of Mr. Weston’s interest-
ing Booklet—“ There’s Money in the Pen” ;
it explains all about the Course.

Stell: Your classification is wrong. It’s
only the surgeon-specialist who prefers to be called
“Mister.” And, as a rule, he prefers to be called
it only until he can persuade somebody to call him
“Sir”.... Arty: Too small a subject to get through
unless the pen was very sprightly Una O.: Scrapoed
accordingly, but with some regret. The work is
good, but the subject is p00r.... A.F.: Out down by
half it would stand a better chance.... Ohota P.:
That infant isn’t an infant any longer—it is an
army.... Eve: Pleasant little verses that move along
familiar lines... .Ripponlea: The sonnet is a bit
unusual, but it breathes a fine spirit:—
To hazy literary heights I aspire,
E’en though, mayhap, as yet my work is strange;
Unbounded is my vision, also my range,
As each delightful unbelabourds’t phrase I arrange.
Writing to Time and Space doth raise my ire.
A delicate style is mine to acquire ;
From this preconceived policy I will not change,
And then my work will seem on fire.
For to the world myself will I endear;
From Triumph on to Triumph I’ll achieve.
With songs sweeter than of Sparta and of Troy.
For various are the themes I’ve up my sleeve,
And as yet I’m merely but a boy
And in due time to th’ world will they appear.
. ...J.C.V.: It doesn’t suit our complexion....
8.V.E.: Thanks; but we couldn’t publish that....
0.M.L.: Doesn’t move u 5.... Dorothy G.: Rather a
feeble little thing. .. .Plantagenet J.: Too obvious...
H.E.C.: Doesn’t [make us believe it’s true....
W.E.8.: “Tom” didn’t cheer u5....R.F. (Parkville):
Imitative; and it hasn’t enough virtues to counter-
balance that defect.... Harry P.: Not the goods for
this sixpenn’orth. .. .0.R.M.: Not up by some dis-
tance. . . .E.M.G.: Nothing in it.... Stranger: The
point is too blunt... .Vera C.: Not well enough
done... .R.E.R.: “The Witch Girl” falls down in a
few places. It might be worth more attention....
8.M.N.0.: The cow yarn is thin and old. ...W.H.8.:
Misses... .J. A. Iv.: No good. .. .N.A.E.: “The Faith

poor verse.... Echo: Bad verse with an evil smell.

write about the little things you know ?... . Rin
Chin: Very barren.. .E.M.E.: Misses... Double Issue:
Sounds too improbable.... Margaret M.: There’s an
idea, but it is not well worked out. See if you can't
do it better... .D.J.H.: A variation of an old, old
theme... .8.C.M.; The “Unwanted” don’t cry in a
sufficiently moving fashion. .. .Joe W.: Doesn’t make
us want to print it. .. .H.H.T.: Very rugged....
Angus: It’s probably very profound poetry; anyway,
we don’t understand it:—
Dad and Mum whilst lying in their bed
Roared with laughter as they Jimmy’s letter read.
Said Dad, “He’s clever, you must agree;
We’ll be better off—yes, you and me.
Yes, Mum, I wish him luck, I really do;
Pigs we will fat, if it’s but a few.
We’ll send them down upon the lorry,
Even if it makes the other fellow sorry.
The prices given were far too low ;
It’s kept us poor, my frame is like a crow.”
. ...Anticus: There is nothing weaker in verse than
a string of unanswered commonplace questions. ...
A.R.S.: Falls down badly... .L.A.R.: Hasn’t much
point... .Nazarite: The poem about the snow piled
high to make love’s funeral pyre doesn’t make our
spine crinkle as it should.... A.A.1.: The verse is
not bad, but it doesn’t get to anything. .. .8.C.F.:
Misses.... Bellerive: You seem to be paying the
usual penalty of fame: —
The crockery upon the dresser shook
To a thundering rat-tat-tat;
I opened the door to a canvasser—
Now what do you think of that ?
“I learnt,” said he, “about your poems,
From a friend named Mr. Green,
A reader of the weekly verse—
In the Sydney Bulletin.”
He mentioned Henry Lawson’s name,
And the works of Roderic Quinn;
Claimed to be a poet himself,
Who’d failed to get ’em in.
“Man’s lucky,” he sighed, “to be alive;
’Tis no use to complain” ;
Glanced up at the cloudy sky,
And inquired ’twas going to rain.
He gently opened a leather bag
Upon the doorstep mat,
And tried to sell me a fountain-pen—
Now, what do you think of that?
....Snagging: The verse falls far short... .G.A.
(Howard) : The sonnet is not up... .K..J.5.: Your dear
“Old Maiden” weeps in vain. .. .P.F. (Childers):
None of the verses reach the standard. Incidentally,
don’t write on both sides of the paper.... J.S.: “Rain”
courses through rather old ground. But it is quite
promising... .D. Mae: No use here. .. .C.E.11.: Yarns
written in imitation of those in the “Young Lady’s
Companion” can’t roost in this tree. .. .F.M.H.: Poor
and commonplace. . . .W.Ii.K.: “The Bridegroom”
doesn’t deserve the eminence of print.. . .Will R.:
Doesn’t get to anything... .N.C.M.: Your birds seem
to fly tail-first, with their feathers stuck in the. wrong
way. .. .T.8.C.: The verse is too staggering and
weak to carry the ideas.... Arthur M.: Not quite
interesting enough... .Harold L.: Bad prose chopped
up to look like verse... .L.N. (Tas.) :No use to u~.
.... A.M.H.: Sorry, that ground has been ploughed
already. .. .L.R.: Too trivial... .G.R.: Doesn't sound
true... .C.L.J.: A bit off our beat... .Mantis: We've
cancelled your poet’s license for going to sleep over
your steering-wheel.... Avalon: We’ll buy anything
from anybody if it’s of interest to Australians end
well enough d0ne....H.J.M.: Pity to waste such
good work on a thing that is merely horrible....
Tom F.: Fair, but a bit thin.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
M.D.: Your prize ram is pathetically like a billy-
goat. . . .A.J.R.: Not up. .. . J.C.H.: Bullocky with
deformed arm sent to the home for incurables....
A.A.8.: Call round again when you’ve got whiskers.
. ...J.C.C.: Drawing below the mark... .L.F.: An®-
mic humor. .. .R.M. Suspiciously ancient smell about
both... . T.L.: Much scratch, little effect.... G.W.:
That gag’s had many birthdays... .V.W.: They’re
terrible boots, anyway 8.C.: Gentleman with a
foot at the end of his sleeve cast forth. .. .L.D.T.:
Yours is the valor of innocence.... D.M.: Cuneiform
characters very pretty, but we can’t even tell the dog.
from the fat lady’s reputation.
“Pollio”: Sorry to explode “Iford’s” de-
lightful theory (B. 5/6/’24 ) that Cape Lip-
trap (Vic.) was named after a prize-fighter's
booze. But Lieutenant Grant himself has
made guessing unnecessary. “I named the
northernmost cape,” he wrote in his journal,
“after my friend John Liptrap, Esquire, of
London.”

Australian Prices of
Studebaker Cars

Special-Six-—from £565.
Big-Six—from £695.
Car illustrated below:
Light-Six 5-seater Touring Car.
Australian Body., £455.
Imported Body, £485.
STUDEBAKER motor cars are not
built down to a price. Quality-
alone is the objective toward which
manufacturing endeavours are directed.
Studebaker could cheapen its product.
Butin buildinga cheap car one skimped
in material and slighted in workman-
ship— Studebaker’s 72-year-old reputa-
tion would be sacrificed.
Hidden Qualities Reveal
Value
Consider upholstering for example.
Imitation leather could be used in the
open models instead of genuine leather
which costs about 300 per cent more.
In the closed car models, cotton or or-
dinary wool material, or a mixture of
both, could be used instead of Chase
Mohair, made from the fine fleece of
Angora goats. It costs up to £2O per
car more to use Chase Mohair. But the
extra cost is justified by its long wearing
qualities. That is why Studebaker uses
Chase Mohair.
In place of Timken bearings, cheaper
bearings could be used. But the Timken
bearing wears longer, is adjustable and
delivers maximum satisfaction to the
owner. There are few cars, regardless of
price, which equal Studebaker in the
wide use of Timken bearings.
Highest Grades of Steel
Used
On some steels, a 15 per cent bonus
is paid to makers in order to get
Studebaker formulas exact. Average
grades could be used and save this 15
per cent. But quality would have to
suffer by such false economy.
• Lack of vibration is a feature for which
Studebaker engines are famous. It is
accomplished by machining Studebaker
crankshafts on all surfaces not simply
the bearing surfaces. The extra cost Of
doing this is £120,000 yearly.
Inspections Safeguard
Quality
These are just a few illustrations of
the extra amounts spent by Studebaker
to secure quality. The 1200 inspectors
who make 30,000 inspections on every
Studebaker car; the laboratories in
which 125 experts are employed, all are
essential in safeguarding quality.
And yet with all the money spent to
obtain the highest quality, the prices of
Studebaker cars are unusually low. That
is because the demand for 15 0,000
Studebaker cars per year cuts produc-
tion costs. Savings result to offset the
extra cost of quality. Economies are
also effected through the policy of manu-
facturing in Studebaker’s own factories,
practically every vital part used in
Studebaker cars.
So the purchaser obtains not only high
quality, but high value as well when he
buys a Studebaker car. No wonder
Studebaker sales have almost trebled in
the last three years'.

“Calixto M.”: Wrecks, of which there are
a good many round the M.L. coast, have
yielded some good divvies to salvage opera-
tors lately. From the Port Elliot, which
ran ashore on East Cape, two propellers
valued at £BOO apiece were recently re-
covered. Each contains five and a half tons
of phosphor bronze.
‘ Harold Hardupp”: Letters from Germany
no longer present the appearance of having
been posted by millionaires—an indication
that the stabilisation of tlie mark has met
with some success. A package received from
.Berlin a few months ago had been started
on its journey with stamps showing a face
value of 30 million marks: an equal-sized
packet which arrived the other day had a
single stamp of the 30-pfennig denomination.

“Gordon Morrison” : “X2X” (B. 22/5/’24>
is right; viewed microscopically, Sydney milk
must be about the best-populated fluid in
the world. But to improve it considerably
with the present system of can-distribution
is practically impossible. Why not take a
leat from American methods? In San Fran-
cisco, prior to being retailed at (id. to 7d.
a quart, milk is pasteurised and bottled in
depots under the direct supervision of the
city s health officer, who also examines
samples bacteriologically and chemically
every two weeks.

Derf Cornmor : Thousands of cane-
cutters, with visions of big cheques, leave
the southern cities each year for North
Queensland, and this year plenty of such
visions should be realised. Everywhere crops
are looking splendid. In the Lower Burdekin
it is estimated the district’s sugar yield will
be worth over £1,000,000, and Mackay and
other centres will be a good deal better. Evi-
* *l5 e " lvon at Cairns last week before the
Arbitration Court showed that some cutters
earned from £220 to £250 for last season—
the guns, of course, who in a good patch can
knock out as much as £l2 to £35 weekly.
It s a poor cutter, in fact, who cannot earn
£8 m good cane.
D.F. •: There are some good arguments
tor Australian timber at Cattle Bay, one of
the inlets of Twofold Bay. They are the
posts of the crush yards from which Dr
Imlay used to ship his cattle to Tasmania 8(3
years and more ago. They are still appa-
lently sound and solid, and look good for
another century. The Imlays were about
the first station-holders on the far South
Coast of N.S.W., and Dr. Imlay had a con-
tract to supply beef to the convict settle-
ment on Tasman Peninsula (Port Arthur),
lie had a station at Lagoon Bay, on the east
side of Forestier Peninsula; the cattle from
.twofold Bay were landed there and driven
overland to be slaughtered.

“The Deacon”: Women are invading yet
another domain of the casual wage-earner* In a
western Sydney suburb on a recent morning I
noticed a team of “dodger” distributors work-
ing like beavers along several streets. As
most of the women were either at work or on
the front verandah sunning themselves, the
lady grafters were in most instances able to
pass the literature on direct—on*the wing as
it were. Compared with the greasy indi-
vidual who crumples the stuff up and throws
Ll Vei 'V! : J’ d J .- 0 ! lly , succeeds in raising the
curses of the tidy householder when it is dis-
covered later on, and who only works at
nail, speed, with occasional intervals for beer
these women made it look as though another
line of business might pass away from the
mere male.
: The State railways, mostly
hard hit by motor-lorry competition, might
take a tip from certain English companies
it they want to recover some of their lost
custom. In all U.K. towns of any size, a
p.c. to the nearest goods station brings a
lorry to the door, and also ensures that
goods are delivered by lorry at the con-
signee s address— not the nearest station
as a rule, without any charge above the
actual rail freight. The responSbili?y of X
railway co. runs not from station to station,
but from door to door. Such a system
here would be a godsend, but doubtless it
would arouse a storm of protest from the
host of carriers who now fatten on the inefli-
ciency of the railways and the casualness of
the public.

“Panchaz”: The N. S. Wales Lands De-

that the reserves for the preservation of
native flora are a joke. These sanctuaries
tor the beauties of the bush should be
amongst our most jealously-guarded reserves,
but any stray applicant who comes along can
usually obtain a lease of one. The greater
number of the reserves are in the better
parts of the State, particularly the North
Coast where vegetable pests are rampant. In
the absence of supervision the pests have in
many instances got a grip on the land, and
instead of the reserve being a beautv-snot
it is quite likely to develop into a menacelo

“Box 689”: Saintdom may have a modern
conscript shortly. An irate female has writ-
ten to the M.L. Pensions Board threatening
that if her husband’s pension is not increased
she will be forced to lead an immortal life.
“V.A.8.W.” : The old P. and O. liner Aus-
tralia, lost in 1890, was not the first of that
co.’s steamers to come to an untimely end
(B. 22/5/’24). The Indus was lost on the
east coast of Ceylon and the Tasmania in
the Straits of Bonifacio in the ’eighties.
“Uramao” : Ward and Massey were not the
only recipients of mementoes from Maori-
land’s gift (and still unpaid for) battleship.
Through the instrumentality of Admiral
Halsey, the first commander of the boat, who
conceived a liking for Waitaki High School
on his two visits, enough wood has been
donated to that institution to construct the
furniture for a Hall of Memories about to
be erected in honor of the school’s war heroes.
“Skipper” : “Billy Cann,” on the luxuries
that occasionally found their way to Galli-
poli (B. 15/5/’24), recalls many a tasty dish
I shared with my batman in the early days
there. He preserved a discreet silence as to the
origin of the feast, and I asked no questions,
contenting myself with replenishing the purse
from time to time. One night a barge carry-
ing stores was driven ashore, and so fierce
was the gale that some invalid port intended
for the hospital was carried right into the
front-line trenches.
“The Oldest”: One of the oldest pubs on
the Sydney Rocks, having lost its license
through the Reduction Board’s operations,
has passed into the hands of the Anglican
Church Mission, which has philanthropically
converted it into a refuge or night shelter
for down-and-outs. The Beehive, as the
house was named, stands in Princes-street, by
the bridge over the Argyle Cut, and was
built out of stone quarried therefrom. It
was first licensed about 1845, the licensee be-
ing one William Cole, who had previously kept
the Brown Bear in Lower George-street, the
pub which gave its name to Brown Bear-lane,
now Little Essex-street.
“Herodot”: Just prior to the first Con-
scription referendum, when rejection certifi-
cates were in demand, a few doctors and
chemists in Sydney and Melbourne reaped a
harvest. One chemist prepared a potion
guaranteed to secure the rejection of any-
body who took it a short time before being
medically examined. Putting this up in one-
ounce bottles, he disposed of it at several
pounds a bottle to a clientele which consisted
mostly of employees or patrons of the pony-
racing industry. In a large number of cases
the stuff was successful in obtaining the de-
sired result. Composed of strychnine and
another drug, its effect was to temporarily
disturb the action of the heart. As is usual,
however, Nemesis had a look in somewhere.
There was a strong suspicion that one timid
youth died from the effects of it, while the
chemist himself shortly afterwards went to
gaol for a long term in connection with an-
other matter.
Back from England, on a brief business
visit to Australia, West and East, James
David Connolly, who Agent-Generalled for
W.A. for two terms, from 1917 to 1923. A
native of Warwick (Q.), he heard the call
of the Coolgardie goldfields in his early twen-
ties, and plunged into contracting and build-
ing in the mining settlements at an age when
the average ’Varsity undergrad, is still
struggling for a degree. His rise in the State
Parliament was rapid; for five years he was
leader of the Upper House, and Colonial Sec-
retary in the Moore and Wilson administra-
tions. Before succeeding Newton Moore as
Agent-General, he had a term in the Assem-
bly as member for Perth. He had no pre-
tensions to oratory or dialectic skill, but
established a reputation for administrative
capacity and straightforwardness. Like his
predecessor, Moore, he was approached to
stand for a seat in the Commons when he
relinquished the job of representing his State
in London, but either modesty or conflicting
business interests, or both, led him to decline.
“Hoppy”: Touching the suitability of
Papua for successful cotton-growing (B.
15/5/’24), it is worth mention that the last
season’s crop from Kiana Tavai plantation,
near Patakalana, which was sold to Bond
and Co., the stocking manufacturers, of Syd-
ney, lias been pronounced far superior in
quality to parcels purchased by them in
America, Queensland and New Caledonia.
The fly_ in the ointment, according to
“Natara,” is the native labor question and
the proneness of Brown Brother to knock off
work for a feast or a funeral. But this only
applies to casual labor. Indentured labor is
recruited from anywhere up to 300 miles dis-
tant, and there is little chance for the inden-
tured laborer, signed on for one, two or
three years, to go to many funerals of his
kith or kin. As to the contention that “in-
dentured labor, unless it can be profitably
utilised during the growing of the crop, is
extremely expensive,” cotton plants, when
growing, require considerable attention if the
cr oPS® re to be kept clean, etc. In any case,
a 0000-acre estate will offer plenty of scope
for energy for all its indentured labor.
“Lex” on the degeneracy of juries:—
In Spain, under the regime of General de Rivera,
the first institution to go was trial by jury. Experi-
ence had shown that the more formidable the criminal
the less disposed juries were to convict. There are
tunes when I fancy that a De Rivera would not
be out of place in Australia. Take two fairlv
typical cases of last week:—
Edward Ephraim was charged with shopbreaking
and stealing or, alternatively, receiving. A police*
man swore he saw Ephraim leaving a shop which
) v a ® afterwards found to have been burgled, and
in Ephraim s room and on his person were discovered
articles identified by the wronged trader as his.
Acquitted.
Mervyn McAuliffe was charged with having stolen
a motor-car. He admitted that he had had the
car for a week, and that it was in a garage un-
known to its owner when retrieved by the police.
But he had not meant to steal it—only to take
rt for joy rides. Acquitted.
In each of these cases the good old doctrine of
“recent possession’’ was employed to win over the
jni y. All that the accused had to do was give
a reasonable account” of how they became possessed
of the property—satisfy the jury that, whatever else
they intended, they did not mean to commit theft.
Abortionists practically always escape—especially if
they are doctors—even though their previous mis-
haps have been notoriously as numerous almost as
the sands of the sea. Judges and magistrates go
a good deal on the demeanor, etc., of the accused
or defendant; juries apparently never do. Any old
story, told by the most palpable ruffian or degene-
rate, goes down, provided it can be brought within
the four corners of a legal quibble.

r|"l HE smooth Pacific rollers came
White-armed and warm to meet
L her;
The winds that set the seas aflame
Swept to the shore to greet her.
While in the port the ferries shrilled
Their songs like sirens jesting,
Outside the ocean world seemed stilled
In thought to plan the testing
Of the sheer valor of this ship
By men’s hands newly fashioned
How would she strip, as fighters strip,
To meet the storms impassioned?
Deep in the swell her black bows dipped,
And sea and rail ran level;
Along her sides the smooth waves slipped
In soft and evil revel,
Till at their loathsome touch, it seemed,
She sprang with swift screws racing;
From crest to trough her forefoot gleamed
And foam spun, lightly tracing
The shape of this new hull that sought
To prove again the story
Of ships that cunning man had wrought
To crown his skill with glory.
The winds fled back beyond the sky
Till night should come and smother
All that a captain reckons by
On one course or another.
At dark they drove the storm-clouds down
In lowing herds before them,
With waves that changed from blue to brown
The ocean’s breast that bore them.
Into the wrack of spray and clouds, ,
With ne’er a star-beam burning,
The new ship drove, with crying shrouds,
And mighty engines turning.
Now in wide arcs, as lost stars reel,
The black seas rolled and rolled her.
Yet nothing could withstand her steel;
So had the hammers told her.
Nor would her loud propellers fail,
Though in extreme uplifting
They spun white foam, as in a gale
The broken surf goes drifting.
In the deep troughs that grip and cling
She fought and lunged and quivered,
Then rose to meet another swing,
Another blow delivered.
Nothing could aid her but the hand
Of man on wheel and throttle,
And the true workmanship that planned
And built her for this battle.
So the fight staggered through the night,
Men cursing in her tunnels,
Men shouting from her bridge-deck white,
Through seas that lashed her funnels.
Nothing could aid her but the laws
That give to man the power
To take hard-driven hulls across
Black ocean’s blackest hour.
There came next day no pleasant dawn
With smiles to shower upon her;
For days the battle was not drawn
Nor lost nor won. No honor
Came to the tortured ship that reeled
And leaped and plunged and thundered.
But that their hearts with pride were steeled,
Oft would her crew have wondered
Whether she’d rise or fight no more
From knock-out blows that thudded
So, ’mid the seas’ and engines’ roar,
Are the great sea-ships blooded.

To Blame or to Pity?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
M| HE passed out of the lighted drawiug-
room into the warm gloom of the
palm-house. The youth at her side
piloted her past Wakeford, the international
shipping man, and his friend St. Johns, and
drew her to the farthest, darkest palm-
corner. St. Johns rose.
“Come on, Wakeford. We’re in the way.”
The two strolled in silence out of the
palm-house to the smoking-room. St. Johns
proffered cigars.
“She’s been here five days,” he said. “She
has not, to the best of my knowledge, passed
a single night alone.” lie pulled hard at
his cigar. “Funny problems, these women.”
The other drew his cigar to a glow before
replying. “They don’t interest me,” he said.
“I am accustomed to ladies. That sort of
female I leave alone.”
There was a deep silence. Suddenly—-
amazingly—the other said: “A good Samari-
tan, eh?”
“What?” Wakeford sharply inclined his
ear.
“Ever read the Bible?” continued the
other, still amazingly.
Wakeford, being a man of breeding and
restraint, did not stare. He merely hesi-
tated. Then : “Now and again,” he said.
“ ’Member the yarn about the fellow who
ran up against thieves? They stole his
clothes and bastinadoed him.”
Wakeford’s mind groped back through the
long years. “Ye-es,” he said.
“And then there passed by a pious Jew.
He took no notice. Then a rich merchant.
He also passed by. Finally, a gentleman
from Samaria, not too well off. ’Member
what he did?”
Wakeford coughed. “This takes me back,”
he said. “Many years. To the days of my
youth”
“Precisely. Well, the Samaritan gave him
food and clothes, set him on his feet again,
and wms called ‘the good Samaritan’ ever
after.”
He knocked ash off his cigar wfitli an agile
little finger. Then ensued a pregnant pause.
“Well?” said Wakeford at last.
“You don’t see the relevancy?”
“No.”
“You may, later.” He broke off to call
to the waiter. “What’re you having?”
They ordered alcohol, and for a while
talked of everyday things. Presently the
conversation turned back to the problem of
the woman.
“The statement of the problem is simple
enough,” said St. Johns. “Here is a young
girl—l’d say she was .20 —pretty, clever,
fascinating, well-bred. And quite immoral.
How do you look at it?”
The other ruminated. “I confess,” he
began, “that, in spite of the general—er—
modernity of the age, I hold to the prin-
ciples of my father and grandfather. When
you have said ‘immoral’ you have said every-
thing I want to hear.”
“Ye-es. I suppose that’s so. You haven’t
worried about these things?”
“No. Why should I?”
“Why, indeed!” St. Johns laughed. “It
must be very comfortable to be like that,”
he added.
Wakeford wrinkled his brows. “I don’t
follow. You’re a peculiar person, you know.
So far, everything serious you’ve said has
been unintelligible to me.”
“ ’Fraid it’s not a thing that explains it-
self. But —well, you, I take it, blame that
girl? She lives that life through her own
innate wickedness —eh?”
Wakeford appeared to consider. He ear-
nestly scrutinised the end of his cigar.
“Well, yes.” He took a whiff. “Of course,
I’m a business man, pure and simple. Never
had time—or particular inclination —to
study the why and wherefore of these
matters.”
The other was silent.
“On the whole,” added Wakeford, “I don't
think my own code is such a bad one. It
has satisfied me throughout my life.”
Suddenly St. Johns laughed, a laugh with
no mirth in it. “You’re marvellous,” he
said. “Simply marvellous. I suppose you
control some 15 million pounds’ worth of
work and material in this world. Society
let-- you— you, mark you—have the use of it,
for good or evil to the rest of the world.
You! It’s marvellous.”
Wakeford frankly stared at him. He had
known this man a week now. For the first
time he wished he had not.
Very suddenly St. Johns recovered. “To
get back to the eternal question of woman—
this woman,” he said lightly. “Setting aside
the matter of abstract morality—we’ll say
she is wicked, according to the usual view—
I think myself that it isn’t entirely her own
fault.” He seemed anxious to revise the
sentence. “What I mean is, who can tell
what is responsible?—you’ve got to trace the
matter down to first causes.”
Wakeford was disconcertingly silent.
“To put it in simpler words, how do we
know what made her go wrong? There may
have been a host of things—lack of money,
bad parents, medical reasons, anything. You
can’t blame her. You must pity her.”
His listener shrugged. “We differ,” he
said. “I think I’ll turn in.”
He rose and strolled out of the smoking-
room, The long electric-lit corridors were
as yet deserted and strangely silent as he
passed through them. Then as he turned the
corner leading to his room he heard voices.
At the far end a man and a woman passed
rapidly along a corridor at right, angles to
the one in which he was. It was the girl
of the palm-liouse and the youth. They
were walking towards her room.
“Telia!” Wakeford shrugged. Presently,
as he stood before his own door —“Fool!’
he said in response to a memory.
* * * *
They breakfasted together. St. Johns was
unusually silent. “Three detectives arrived
late last night,” lie said at last. “Have you
anything worth stealing?”
Wakeford put down his coffee-cup very
quickly and stared at him. “Is that so?”
“Yes. Does it affect you?”
Wakeford considered an instant. “In a
way.” lie said, guardedly.
"So it does me. In fact, I gave them the
hint myself.”
“What for?”
“My own reasons. Not my own stuff,
worse luck. But I shouldn’t like to lose it.”
“But do you think there will be an
attempt ?”
“No, I don’t think. I know.”
They ate in silence for a minute.
“Who is it?” asked Wakeford.
“An American. Well known.”
“H’m. I’ll have to see those detectives.”
“I shouldn’t.”
“Why?”
“Well, if you’ve anything worth stealing
that’s the surest way of letting the thieves
know it. Keep quiet.”
“Mine’s in the strong room.”
“So’s mine. I’m taking it out this after-
noon.”
The other was perplexed. “But” he
began.
“Well, where d’you think they’ll look
first?”
* * * *
That night the after-dinner loungers were
treated to the spectacle of two young, exceed-
ingly well-born men, clad in evening-dress,
fighting primitively on the first landing. The
lady in the case stood half-way up the second
flight and looked on.
St. Johns and Wakeford joined the rush
from the smoking-room at the first sounds
of combat. They could hear the voice of
the manager mingled with the uproar as they
strode through the main hall. A patent-
leather shoe suddenly fell from above.
“What odds that girl’s in it?” asked St.
Johns.
“It wouldn’t surprise me.”
She was. The rivals fought savagely some
six feet below her. She stood on the stairs
and watched them excitedly, one hand at her
bosom, her lips parted and a perfectly dis-
cernible smile on her face.
The affair was over as soon as Wakeford
and St. Johns arrived. Large authoritative
men took command of the situation, hustled
the dishevelled young men off to their rooms,
blandly excused everything to the women who
had been attracted. The manager, -waving
a handkerchief, wandered bleating in and
out of the throng. People began slowly to
disperse.
“Quite prehistoric, wasn’t it?” said St.
Johns.
“It was. Fine subject for a picture.”
“She looked her part, too.”
“She enjoyed it. Her sort do.”
Suddenly they heard the voice of the man-
ager raised on a higher, firmer note.
“Kindly leave the hotel at once. No, I
said at once!”

Have you suspected
your Kidneys?
Are you dragging along day in and day out with a dull,
throbbing backache?
Do you feel lame in the morning, tired all day; suffer sharp,
torturing twinges at every sudden move? Then there’s something
wrong!
You may never have suspected your kidneys, yet often it’s
the kidneys that are at fault. A cold, strain, or overwork congests
the kidneys and slows them up; poisons accumulate in the system,
and many mysterious aches and pains result.
You may have headaches and dizzy spells, too, with perhaps
some annoying bladder irregularity. Don’t wait for more serious
trouble. Use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They have helped
many Sydney folks. They should help you.
SYDNEY TESTIMONY
Mr. A. B. Cowell, wlio lives at the corner of Park Road
and Hardy Street, Mascot, Sydney, says“ Some months ago I
was suddenly seized with a terrible pain across my back, just
above the kidneys. It did not go away, as I thought at first it
would, but, on the contrary, it got worse, and I was soon so bad
that I was bent almost double. I was completely crippled and
even at night I got very little rest from the constant pain. I
could not turn over without suffering acutely, in fact, no
position was comfortable for long. My secretions were affected,
being thick and cloudy, with a red sediment. I tried different
remedies, but they gave me no relief whatever. One day a
friend suggested I should take Doan's Backache Kidney Pills,
and it proved to be good advice, too, for three bottles cured me
completely. I feel splendid now. and my recovery is due solely
to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.’’
Pour years later Mrs. Cowell says : —“My son is still well,
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills having completely banished all
signs of kidney trouble.’’
DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS are sold by all chemists and stores
at 2/9 per bottle, or from Foster-McClellan Co.,

IRRITATION OF THE SKIN USE
DOAN’S OINTMENT.
SYDNEY PEOPLE TESTIFY.
A WOMAN’S WORD.
Mrs. W. Membrey, Como, 79 Sim-
mons Street. Enmore, says :—“Fox-
three yeai-s I was a martyr to Piles,
and I don’t think any ailment causes
more suffering and loss of sleep. I
used Pile remedies, and was treated
by a doctor, but nothing gave me any
relief. After so many failures I
thought there was no cure for this dis-
tressing complaint, but I was mis-
taken, as a treatment with Doan s
Ointment proved. A short course of
this wonderful preparation cured me,
and I advise sufferers to give it a
trial.” ~ ,
Eleven years later Mrs. Membrey
says:—“Doan’s Ointment cured me of
Piles over eleven yeai-s ago,. and 1
have been free of the complaint ever
since.”
A MAN’S WORD.
Mr. A. H. Francis, 192 Union Street,
Erskineville, Sydney, says :—“I used
Doan’s Ointment for Itching and Pro-
truding Piles, and I am pleased to tell
you it completely cured me. Previously
I had tried all kinds of Ointments, but
they gave me little or no relief. 3 was
suffering terribly when I first applied
Doan’s Ointment, and had little hone
of it doing me any good, but its sooth-
ing and healing effect was noticeable
almost at once, and by the time I had
used one pot I was completely cured,
all signs of Piles having disappeared
entirely. 1 am a great believer in
Doan’s Ointment, and consider it the
best Pile remedy known.”
Twelve months later. Mr. Francis
says:—“l have not been troubled with
Piles since Doan’s Ointment cured me.”

The two men turned sharply. “Turning
her out!” said St. Johns. They walked slowly
back to the scene of the disorder.
Two waiters, the manager and three or
four men were grouped on the landing. Facing
them was the girl.
“But I can’t. I’ve nowhere to go,” she
was saying. There were tears in her voice.
“I couldn’t help them fighting.”
“No? D’you think I’m blind?” The man-
ager’s sneer cut across her sentence like a
whip-lash. The girl reddened from neck to
forehead.
“What business is that of yours?”
She was struggling with her emotions. The
manager looked her up and down, from her
heaving bosom to her silk-stockinged feet.
The glance was an insult.
“My business all right. This is a hotel,
not a”
The color died out of her face. Her
very lips went white. Two of the men
looking on turned abruptly and walked away.
St. Johns gave a start and took one pace
forward. Wakeford pulled at his sleeve.
"Come on. We’ve heard enough. Sooner she
goes the better.”
St. Johns snatched his arm away. He
went forward as the manager began again
to speak. He pushed past that gentleman
and took the girl’s arm.
“Come with me,” he said. She hesitated,
as if suspicious of him. “It’s all right. 1
know where you can go to-nigiit,” he added
reassuringly. “We’ll see about your clothes
in the morning.” »
Amid a dead silence he led her past the
group of men. Down the stairs and into
the hall. Curious eyes watched him. He
spoke to the commissionaire, and a taxi slid
out of the darkness up to the door.
Later he joined Wakeford in the smoking-
room. He ordered a liqueur.
“I confess you baffle me,” began Wakeford.
“Mind you, I like you for what you did. But
—is it worth it? In fact, does it do more
good than harm?”
St. Johns rolled a mouthful of Chartreuse
, round his palate before replying. “Yes,” he
said at last.
He took a cigar from the box on the table.
“Emphatically yes,” he added. “But I think
it would take me a long while to make you
see why. Or, rather, why I think so. I
doubt if ever I should, in fact.”
“Try,” suggested the other, aiid handed
him his cigar-cutter.
“We, unfortunately, have very little com-
mon ground. In a nutshell, it is thus. You
believe in the intrinsic evil in human nature
—intrinsic, mark you. Hence, you say, the
—the—general rottenness of life and men.
Quite logically you conclude that, until
human nature alters. Life will not become
better than the unsatisfactory thing it is now.
Now, I, on the other hand, believe in the
intrinsic decency of human nature. My own
idea is that Life—civilisation, if you like—
is a failure because the decency in human
nature has never had the chance to come
out. Practically everything tends to sup-
press it. Which results in—l suppose, by
the way, that you do agree as to the imper-
fections of this life of ours?”
Wakeford was frowning heavily. “Yes.”
he said, deliberately. “I do. Which you’ll
admit is more than a lot of men do. But
what’s all this got to do with the girl?”
St. Johns made a hopeless gesture; then
checked himself. “Everything,” he said in
the calm voice of one holding himself tightly
in hand. “It has everything to do with her.
She’s only one—just one—little example of
what happens to human nature. Life has
got a grip of her. She has —all of us have
—so little control over life. It’s gripped her.
twisted her, made her rotten. She’s typical
of w'hat life does to mankind. _ What it does
all over the world, to all men.”
He was smoking furiously. His voice,
though low and carefully toned, was full of
some fierce, deep emotion. Now he removed
his cigar from his lips for clearer speaking.
“Life—things as they are—the established
order—modern civilisation —call it what
you like —takes hold of everything from its
birth. Human lives, ideas, ideals, things
that start well, that are full of beauty and
hope and power, it takes them aM crushes
them into something hideous. Something
poor and weak and disgusting. Beauty, love,
knowledge—all those things. The pity of it!
What chance has a poor human will against
that force? How can you blame so frail a
thing as human nature if it fails? You
can’t. To punish is to add one more blow
to the thousand that has already fallen. You
must give human nature a better chance.”
He ceased speaking and. glanced at Wake-
■ That • gentleman was lying back in
liis chair. His gaze was riveted on the
ceiling. Ills expression was a mixture of
boredom and pained surprise.
“Sorry,” said St. Johns. His hands were
shaking. “Time I went to bed.”
Wakeford definitely decided to drop him.
Wakeford informed the manager of his loss
at 7.30 the next morning. He sat on the
edge of the manager’s bed.
“My room was not disarranged in the least.
1 should have known nothing had I not
chanced to see a cigar butt on the dressing-
table that I knew was not there last night.
I remembered then something that I thought
was a dream. They must have doped me—
chloroform, or something like it. I feel per-
fectly well this morning. Anyway, there’s
a hundred and twenty-seven pounds of it
gone. Finest ambergris ever found. Worth
twentyrfive thousand.”
The manager took a sip of his coffee. “It
was a preparation of chloral and something
else they gave you,” he said calmly. “We
have the stuff —and the ambergris—in the
strong-room.” He paused and surveyed the
amazement on the other’s face. “Why on
earth you removed it from the strong-room
is beyond me.”
“But, good Lord! Do you mean to say
you’ve got it?”
“Certainly. We also have the gentlemen
themselves —four of them.”
Wakeford gazed helplessly at the manager.
“I took it out on the advice of a friend,” he
observed slowly. Then his brow became
thoughtful. “7/e said lie had some stuff of
his own in the strong-room.”
The manager’s eyes above his coffee-cup
were full of intelligence. He put down his
cup.
“A friend, eh? Called himself St. Johns,
I think? Yes. We have him. He’s quite
well known —but not as St. Johns.”
PHILIP BENN.
The Priming.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SOMETIMES a railway employee will
work fast out of sheer necessity. For
instance, he may have an appointment
with a girl or want to “stop at the corner”
on his way home.
Loading-checker Bangley, of the big goods-
shed, urged, chivvied, bullied and rushed his
barrowmen in an endeavor to speed up the
loading of the 16-ton brake-van in roadside
order for the 23 stations and sidings on the
90-mile run to Paddyvale. The porters, not
understanding, retaliated with remarks, ad-
dressed to the roof, which made the little
spiders run to their mothers on the rafters.
The men engaged in a little sing-song, re-
started old arguments and got in each other s
way. A barrow-load of cased fruit crashed
over, and apples rolled in all directions.
Bangley’s picker-out messed up the brands,
and the work went slower than ever, until
the worried loading-checker took the gang
into his confidence. .
“I’m trying to shake it up,” he explained
to the little assembly behind a stack of cases,
“so as I can finish off the brake before time,
duck home, change and be back again to catch
this same goods train to Paddyvale. My
Uncle Bill is opening a pub at Paddyvale,
and it’s going to be a free house the first
day. He’s asked me to come along and help
be' barman. I’ve got two days’ holiday up
my sleeve, and if I overdo it I’ll have to be
sick. I don’t”
“That’s all right from your point of view,
the stower interrupted.
“Give ’im a fair ’earin’,” said the picker-
out, holding up his case-hook. “Give ’im a
fair cracker the whip.”
“There’s no more to it,” said Bangley, ‘ ex-
cept I’m going to catch No. 121 brake-van or
bust. Opportunity doesn’t come too often in
this life.”
“But,” expostulated the picker-out in a
pained voice, his hook still in the air like
an auctioneer’s hammer, “you can’t rush ’ead-
long inter oceans o’ beer without some sorter
primin’. Thinker the ’arm, man !”
“I’ve thought of that, too. I’ll ride with
the guard and have a few whenever we stop
near enough to a pub.”
“Wot if it’s a wowser guard?” ,
“I don’t know any guard, but I know all
guards drink. Now, is my explanation satis-
factory, or am I to barrow the blasted stuff
into the brake-van myself?”
“Nothin’ else?”
“Nothing,” said Bangley defiantly.
No. 121 brake-van was pulled out of the
shed easily ten minutes before her schedule
time of finishing, and was hooked on to the
tail-end of her rake in the transit yard. Half
an hour later, as the train was slowly mov-
ing out on to the main line, a man dashed
across 20 sets of metals and swung himself
on to the platform of the van. He was
neatly dressed, but showed great signs of
recent hurrying. “Gee!” he gasped breath-
lessly. “I had—to catch —this ’bus.”
The guard blinked red-rimmed eyes at him,
and tried to appear stern and unbending.
“You’ve got no right to do that,” he said.
“Got a permit to travel in the van?”
“Strike a light—no!” said Bangley.
“Never had time. But I’ve brought along a
couple of bottles of beer to freshen the air
if you care about a drink.”
“Good!” exclaimed the guard, his air of
sternness melting. “How far are you going?”
“Paddyvale.”
“Corks!” said the guard, delightedly.
“There’s a pub at every stopping-place ex-
cept at Pigmelon—two there, one each side.”
“Suited!” said Bangley. “I’ll help chuck
the goods out at the stations.”

Although railway wheels revolve in a quick
enough manner, other matters in the Depart-
ment may take months to move. At the age
of a fortnight the joysome trip to Paddyvale
was rapidly dimming in Bangley’s memory
until a file, couched in language not pleasant,
was pushed under his nose. He groaned as
he finished reading.
Five minutes afterwards he walked into
the guards’ room at the Central Railway
Station, and a cursory glance around brought
him face to face with the object of his visit
—the guard with the red-rimmed eyes.
“Hullo.” said Bangley. “Remember me?”
The guard blinked. “I should reckon,”
he answered with a smile. “You went to
Paddyvale with me in the brake-van about
two weeks ago.”
“That’s right. Remember anything else?”
“My oath ! My head was like a circular-
saw gone mad for two days.”
“I understand,” said Bangley grimly. “Got
time to slip out and sink one now?”
Over two foaming beers the guard smiled
reminiscently. “Corks ! I was full that trip.
Got into a bit of a fix with the Department
over it, too.”
“How was that? Everything went all
right, didn’t it? You remember I helped
putting out the goods at each station?”
“You did, old man. I couldn’t help re-
marking you were slick at the game for a
stranger. You seemed to know the proper
stuff to put out at the different stations with-
out looking at the brands or the waybills.
Not a thing over-carried either. The trouble
was we ran half an hour late, and the office
howled like 40 thousand poisoned cats, and
stuck a ‘Please explain’ into me. I had to
wriggle.”
“Of course, you didn’t mention me?”
“Not for all the cherry blossoms in Japan,
old man. We have a way of dodging these
tilings in the railway. We make somebody
else carry the baby.”
“Babies are dirty, irresponsible little
tilings,” remarked Bangley absently.
“Some are,” agreed the guard. “But what
I mean is we pass the blame on. I explained
the late running by blowing in a report on
tlie condition of the loading of the brake-
van. I said it was the most disgraceful truck
I had ever dealt with —everything upside
down and the stations in wrong. I rocked
it into the man who loaded it.”
“Isn’t that unfair?”
The guard chuckled. “He’ll have to w T riggle
like anybody else. Some poor silly cow has
to bear up against official blame,”
“Loading-checker Bangley sighed sadly.
“Yes,” he said tonelessly. “I’m the poor
silly cow who loaded that van. But drink
up, old man ; don’t let me interfere with the
taste of your beer.”
