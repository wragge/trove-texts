The large sale for “EUMENTHOL JU-
JUBES” has led to a number of imitations
being manufactured under the name of men-
thol and other jujubes. It is important,
therefore, when buying to be sure and get
HUDSON’S EUMENTHOL JUJUBES. You
may be asked to buy other jujubes, and be
told they are “just as good” as Hudson’s
Eumenthol Jujubes. This proves that these
imitations and substitutes have no reputa-
tion of their own, and can only be sold on the
good repute and high character of Hudson’s
Eumenthol Jujubes.

July
Despite the war 30 sonneteers took part
in our Australian July competition. Rimes
seem to exasperate R. G, Henderson: —
I’m tired of sonnets on our dozen months.
What do I know of sonnets t That some are quite as
Hot as tiie “Answers to Correspondents’’ column.
Rime cannot do them justice, and I have no
Time to acquire their fit vocabulary,
Not so the rest. They freeze my marrow solid.
Cotton for some—Australian wool for others.
Limejuice for February—June wants something
warmer.
That’s my poetic calendar ! So —July !
Hail, thou midpoint of Winter, months of coughs,
Colds, influenza, football in all the codes,
Hats that can stand the rain, dark clothes, stout
boots
(Sale bargains mostly), tangoes and wliate’er else
Folds in thy gloomy bosom —Hail! July 1
R. G. Henderson.
And “Mick Much” excels himself in his
final simile; —
Jooly’s orlriglit, the days are jist the thing
Fur solid yakker till yer day. is done ;
Uz fur the nights, there’s allez whips o’ fun
In ’ops wif righto heifers ut yer wing.
Then sittin’ tight w’en damcin’s ud its fling,
En kiddin’ to yerself yer jist the one—
Until some screwin’, crook son uv a gun
The diner grabs, en’ show yer’ve ’ad a string.
The ’Urdles now, en' Steeple’s all the go
Ter give the blokes a charnce ter do their dough.
Then fetch a skite their forchin jist got pipped!
It ain’t too dusty livenin’ aroun’
These early morn's wif Jack Frost on the groun’,
Uz if the moonlight froze w’ere it wuz tipped.
Mick Much.
Our sympathy, too, goes out to “Phillip
Phrozeout”: —
Oh, ’oly wars! Ain’t ole July dead tough!
Me pot er mizree’s full; I’m close up blind
Wiv smoke frum soddin wood; I’ve arfer mind
Ter crawl rite up er ’oiler log en’ snuff!
Thet’s ’ow I feel. I’ve got th’ flamin’ ’uff!
It seems like years since good ole Solly shined.
It’s pelted rain ier days, en’, struth! th’ wind
Is blowin’ strate orf liozzie’s frozen scruff!
I’m short er nap, too —thet’s ernuther cow!
’Bout 2 a.m. w’en Jolino’s nippin keen,
Phil’s got ter rise en’ lite er fire er die.
I ain’t er bloke ter make er silly row,
But, struth, sum gems uv purest ray obscene
Er fired frum roun’ me camp-fire et July.
Phillip Phrozeout.
Good average sonnets were submitted by
Charles P. Pettinger, H.W.C., R. Blantyre
and Leslie Lee (2). The sonnets of a higher
class are noticeable this month for their
unevenness. Few are good all through. Some
start off happily, but get chilblains on their
sestettes; others take an octette before they
thaw. In the frozen sestette class are: A.
Gore-. Tones and S. Elliott-Napier, with a
purple alliterative chilblain on his last line;
while Duncan Brown and Emo are frost-
bitten in their octettes. “Aeneas Hayseed”
supplies a straightforward sonnet that looks
too much like a seedsman’s catalogue. Son-
nets by Lilia Gormhuille McKay, Syd. C.,
Nina Murdoch, Mary A. K. Robb and “Jul-
ian” remain for final adjudication. Mary
A. K. Robb begins with a fine image, but
descends to prose in her sestette. There is
more poetry, despite the space taken to
develop his first theme, in Syd. C.’s simple
effort, with its lilting promise of spring:—
A quivering veil of silver rain is thrown
O’er boughs that lift their gold against the grey.
And clings in tremulously crystal spray
To wraith-like blossoms magically blown
In leafless orchards where the earth is strown
With the pale emerald of her new array.
And hark! the river plunging on its way
Thunders in deep, insistent monotone.
But, cold and keen, the wind uprising brings
Snatches of warbled joy that stir the blood.
The bleat of lambs, the breath of flowers new—
And back the cloudy pall impetuous flings,
Baring the wet earth to a golden flood,
Poured from a soft infinity of blue.
Syd. C.
“Julian” just fails by bis carelessness
about the caesura in lines 12 and 13 and his
banal last line :— ■
Now icy spears assail the patient Earth,
Hurtling in shotvers, yet her gracious heart
Bids hut a hundred lovely braveries start.
The sodden fields see the white sundew's
birth,
The pinlc-tipped saplings press to nobler
girth, -
Lichen and fungi ply their fairy art,
And passionate heaths that love and live
apart,
Fling their last challenge to the wintry
dearth.
White mists surge up at dawn, and all the
heights,
Like gleaming isles, float in the silver flood,
Shifted o'er purple gulfs by arrowy lights.
Earth heaves, soft riot parts the brooding
air,
Buds stir, there is a quickening of bright
blood,
And August comes, the fairest of the fair.
Julian.
Of the two sonnets left that 6f Lilia
McKay is more sincere than the somewhat
•elaborate simile of Nina Murdoch. Had the
prize not been offered for an Australian son-
net, it would have gone to Lilia McKay, an
Auckland competitor. She exquisitely pic-
tures a July, but it is a Maoriland July.
JULY.
By T.H.I.A GORMHUILLE Mc KAY.
By fragrant tokens on the wintry way
I know she has been here, timid and fleet,
Too frail to linger yet and boldly meet
Rough Winter's jealous wrath. Saw you
her, pray?
A primrose wreath upon her brow, and gay
Red wind-flowers at her breast, all dewy-
sweet? . .
Heard you the tread of light, wind-driven
feet f
Did such a maid delight your eyes to-day?
Ay! on the highway in the windy morn
\Ve saw her pass, in gown of green arrayed,
Wit a tossing hair and sheaves of daffodils;
But as we spied her Winter's clam’rous horn
Mustered the storm-clouds. Suddenly dis-
mayed.
She fled. The grey rain hid the misty hills.
The best Australian, as distinguished from
Australasian, sonnet is that of Nina Mur-
doch, 77 Ben Boyd-road, Neutral Bay,
Sydney:—
JULY.
By NINA MURDOCH.
The fig-leaves fall before the wind in
sh owers —
A cutting wind that rushes from the west —•
The snow lies thick on Kosciusko’s breast,
And on the coast the twisted ti-tree cowers
Before the rain! Lot in an instant, bowers
Are filled with sunshine as at Spring's behest,
And in a vision, August, golden-tressed,
Passes with joyous arms weighed do ion with
flowers.
July is like an adolescent youth
That wakes the echoes iv-ith his boisterous
shouts,
And then falls dreaming for a sudden space
Lost in a maze ’twixt wonder and the truth
Because of joy and strange desires and
doubts
That move, him at a passing maiden’s face.
Dawning of a horrid doubt as to the Divine
Right.
(A Cartoon by Max Beerbohm.)
Russia
The Mainsprings of Russia, by Maurice
Baring (Nelson, per Dymock’s Library), is
not Red Russia , The Real Russia, Russia as
She Is, or Russia as She Isn't. It is merely
a truthful account of Russia by a. man who
knows the Russians. The Slav is a white
man; he has nothing in common with any-
thing Tartar, Mongol or Semitic, though
from the 13th to the 16th century Russia
was under the dominion of the Mongols.
During the period from the first Mongol
invasion till their expulsion by the Slavs in
the 16th century, Russia acted as a buffer
between Europe and the Oriental barbarians :
it was Russia that saved Europe from the
Mongols.
The most important factor of Russian life
is the Russian peasant. He owns the
greater part of the arable land, owns and
tills it. This fact is practically unknown
outside Russia. The peasant was, indeed, a
serf; but serfdom in Russia was not a
slavery resulting from conquest or difference
in race: it was merely due to economic con-
ditions.
“When the legislation which ultimately
produced serfdom was framed, it was not
regarded by those who framed it as a per-
manent solution of the relations between
landowner and peasant, but only as a tem-
porary makeshift. The result —slavery—
was unforeseen. The peasants never, through
nearly two centuries of slavery, lost sight
of this fact. Moreover, they kept fast hold
of the idea that the land was theirs, that the
land belonged to the. people w r ho tilled it.”
The emancipation of the serfs, in 1861,
meant chiefly that a portion of the land
which the peasant considered to be his by
right was restored to him. Over 350,000,000
acres passed from the hands of the land-
owners into the hands of the peasants for
ever. On an average each peasant received
from eight to 11 acres. The procedure
seems to Australian minds like a gigantic
resumption of estates for closer settlement.
The landowners were paid for the land by
the Government: the peasants had to pay
back to the State in instalments, over a
period of more than 50 years. The State
acted as banker to both parties, paying the
landowners ready money and advancing the
money to the peasants. In 1907 the pay-
ments by the peasants were cancelled. After
the emancipation the land was owned by
the peasants in common, as they had always
held it. All the land that was fit for culti-
vation was divided among the peasants,
according to the number of taxed members in
each household. In 1904 agrarian riots all
over Russia led to every landowner selling
a certain amount of his remaining land to
the peasants. Now the peasant can leave
the Commune, can become the permanent
owngr of his individual share of the land, or
can. exchange his strips of Commune land for
an allotment and start a farm. It is evi-
dent, therefore, that the peasant is the most
important unit in the nation. In the long
run the peasant will become the owner of all
the arable land in Russia.
Jt
Anybody can become a noble in Russia.
He has simply to reach a certain definite
step in the army or the civil service; and
the service is open to anybody who can pass
a certificate examination at the end of his
school time. The two consequences of this
arrangement are that the nobility in Euro-
pean Russia number about 600,000, and there
is nothing aristocratic about such a nobility.
The Russian noble is a State servant.
Originally the servant of the State was
rewarded by the possession of land, and soon
the corollary followed that the landowners
must serve the State. Their land was merely
their pay. Thus no landed or territorial
aristocracy came into existence. “In Russia
there are no feudal castles, no families tak-
ing their names from places, and compara-
tively few stone houses in the country.”
The Russian landowner is an absentee land-
owner ; and in the end the nobility as a caste
of landowners will disappear.
But with such a democratic arrangement,
why is it that Russia is not democratic '! In
practice there is a gigantic machine worked
by a governing class of officials which is
absolutely uncontrolled by public opinion.
“Though the system is theoretically favorable
to the advancement of merit, it is a thousand
times more favorable to mediocrity, routine,
office-hunting, officialdom, red-tape, to the
stifling of all individual initiative, and the
shirking of all moral responsibility. The
chief evil result of the system was the
uncontrolled arbitrary character of the cen-
tral government and the local administration
as carried on by the provincial governors and
other Government officials.”
There is a similar answer to the question :
“Why are the Russian people discontented V”
The reason is that in 1005 explicit promises
were made to the Russian people, which, if
carried out, would insure their complete
political liberty and full rights of citizenship.
These promises have in some cases not been
carried out at all, and in other cases they
have been canned out partially, or according
to the letter and not according to the spirit.
The Government’s attitude toward the Duma
is to do everything to prevent the Duma
becoming a vital factor in the State, and to
try to convert it into a passive annex of
the Government. And the local administra-
tion has the effect of exasperating the people.
The secret police, too, must live; and if they
did not represent the discontent as more for-
midable than it is they might lose their jobs.
And not even a secret policeman likes losing
his job.
£
A word of warning is given by M. Baring
to those who judge the Russians by the works
of their novelists of genius. The characters
of Dostoievsky are Russians; but they are
not average Russians, any more than Lear
is a portrait of the average Englishman, or
Faust the image of the ordinary German
bourgeois, even when he is not laying float-
ing mines. The average Russian is well-
educated, cheerful, sociable, intensely gregari-
ous, hospitable, talkative, expansive, good-
humored and good-natured. He is pre-
eminentlv indulgent, the most tolerant of
human beings, and as a juryman addicted to
verdicts of acquittal.
“Ultimately, it is_ safe to say that the
achievement of political liberty in Russia
will depend not on dynamite and the death
of revolutionaries, nor on the measures of a
statesman, however far-seeing and however
wise, but on the will and desire of the average
man. On the day the average man really
desires political liberty he will get it.”
Of the intelligentsia Baring remarks:
“They are extremely well educated;
infinitely, incomparably better educated than
the average Englishman. They are some-
times over-educated. .. .The average Russian
of the educated middle class is so much
better educated than the average educated
Englishman that comparison would be
5i11y....1f you took an average Russian
schoolboy of 13, and put him at an English
public school, he would find the work given
to an average English schoolboy of 13 not
only easy, but childish In Russia, the
average reading public and the novel-reading
public is on a much higher level than the
average English-reading and novel-reading
public, and the average literature food sup-
plied to it is higher also; the average
Russian novel or story never descends
to the level of silliness which you
find in the great majority of English
magazines The Russian stage is on
a far higher intellectual level than the
English stage, and the Russian theatre-going
public is incomparably more intelligent than
the English theatre-going public.”
“Russians often single out laziness and
the want of practical energy as a national
failing. But the defence of Sevastopol, the
creation of the Trans-Siberian Railway, and
the transport of troops over a single line
during war time, are examples of abnormal
energy in the domain of achievement; and in
the persons of Peter the Great, Suvorov and
Skobeliev Russia has given to the world
examples of terrific and explosive energy*
Stern stuff must exist somewhere in the
Russian character, or else the Russian Em-
pire would not be there to testify to the
fact. The Russian Empire is the result of
something, and it is there.”
Ultimately even Germany will have to
admit this fact.
Poems Translated from the Irish
I SHALL NOT DIE FOR YOU.
0 woman, shapely as the siban,
On your account / shall not die,
The men you've slain. —a trivial clan —■
Were less than I.
I ask me shall I die for these,
For blossom-teeth and scurlet lips?
And shall that delicate swan-shape
Bring me eclipse?
Well shaped the breasts and smooth the skin,
The cheeks are fair, the tresses free;
And yet I shall not suffer death,
Cod over me!
Those even brows, that hair like gold.
Those languorous tones, that virgin way;
The flowing limbs, the rounded heel
Slight men betray.
Thy spirit keen through radiant mien,
Thy shining throat and smiling eye,
The little palm, thy side like foam —*
I cannot die!
0 woman, shapely as the swan,
In a cunning house hard-reared teas I;
O bosom white, O well-shaped palm,
I shall not die.
■—Padraic Colura.
THE STARS STAND UP.
The stars stand up in-the air,
The sun and the moon arc set,
'The sea that ebbed dry of its tide
Leaves no single pebble wet;
The cuckoo keeps saying each hour,
That she, my Storeen, is fled—
O Girl of the brave, free tresses,
Far better had you struck me dead!
Three things have I learned through love,
Sorrow, and death, and pain.
My mind reminding me daily
I never shall see you again;
You left me no cure for my sickness,
Yet I pray, though my night be long—
My sharp grief! and my heart is broken —
That Cod may forgive your wrong.
She was sweeter than fiddle and lute,
Or the shining of grass through the dew,
She was soft as the blackbird’s flute
When the light of the day is new;
From, her feet on the lone hilltop
I have heard the honey dropping;
Why, Girl, did you come to my door:
Or why could you not be stopping?
From “The Poem Book of the Gael.”
You pay your subscription to a circulating
library, and find before you an enormous
number of novels (chiefly) from which to
make your selection. But these novels are not
all the latest novels published. In the latest
issue of The Athenaeum, the London
weekly that notices every London publica-
tion, 25 novels are listed ; and these include
but a small proportion of the novels pub-
lished in the United States and Australia.
But these 25 new novels are not imported
by the Australian subscription library. Only
a selection is bought for your selection. Who
makes that selection of the sort of novels you
will like, and on what principles is that
selection made? The manager of the library
is responsible. In the case of known authors
his judgment is easy. He knows the demand
for a particular popular author, and orders
the dozen or the hundred copies necessary.
In the case of an unknown author the library
manager has had a proof copy long before
the book is published. He cannot be ex-
pected to read every one of these new novels:
he is compelled to dip. The manager of one
Sydney library confesses his method. He
reads, carefully, the first four pages. If that
instalment interests him, he dips further
ahead: if still interested, he orders a copy
or copies. But the main test is the first
four pages. They must interest —or the
new novel is omitted from his list. A hint,
here, to our young authors: make your first
four pages interesting, stimulate your reader
within that limited space, lure her on....
You see the same method of selection in the
average library subscriber. She takes up
one of the latest novels, skims the first para-
graph. the first few pages. “I’ll take this
one, please....” A low basis of judgment,
but the subject-matter is the popular novel
of commerce suitable for vague feminine
reading.

ANTHONY HORDERNS' FOR All SPORTING GOODS
■— (
Anthony Horderns’
for RAZORS.
The MODERN SAFETY RAZOR is an INEXPEN-
SIVE LUXURY; it SIMPLIFIES SHAVING, makes
it SO EASY that the NOVICE is INDEPENDENT
of the BARBER, and, with the GEM JUNIOR, as
well as several OTHER STYLES OF SAFETY
RAZORS, there is a NEW BLADE for EACH DAY
of the week. In the LIST that follows we quote a
SELECTION, and offer them at
ANTHONY HORDERNS’
FAMOUS DOW PRICES.
GEM JUNIOR SAFETY RAZOR.
The GEM JUNIOR SAFETY RAZOR solves the
problem for the man who cannot rely upon the old-
style Razor. It is unequalled for easy and luxurious
Shaving, and does not scrape nor pull.
The GEM JUNIOR SAFETY RAZOR, with the
New Bar, adds still further to the EFFICIENCY
of this popular Safety Razor. THE GEM JUNIOR
provides a KEEN BLADE for EVERY day in the week.
Every Blade automatically adjusts itself, and as the
BLADE does the shaving it is the first consideration.
GEM JUNIOR BLADES are made from the best
Razor Steel, tempered by a process, patented by the
Gem Cutlery Co. (the oldest makers of Safety
Razors), that provides a keen, lasting edge.
After using GEM JUNIOR BLADES several times
they may be stropped—the steel is superior, the
temper and edge so fine that stropping makes them
as good as ever.
The New Bar smoothes out the creases of the skin,
raises the beard just ahead of the cutting edge, and
makes perfect shaving a simple matter.
The GEM JUNIOR SAFETY RAZOR is made and
finished in the BEST STYLE, of the BEST materials,
and by the best workmanship. It comprises Nickel-
plated Frame, extra handle for Stropping Blades, and
Seven KEEN-EDGED BLADES, packed in neat case.

Extra Blades for the GEM JUNIOR RAZOR,
Packet of 7, 2/-; by post, 2/1.

somely finished, triple silver-plate, with 12 special
blades for heavy beards. The GEM PALACE makes

GEM STROPPING MACHINE, specially designed
for the GEM JUNIOR SAFETY RAZOR. It can be
used with any strop. The operation is simple, the
handle is automatically adjusted to the correct
angle, and a keen edge is speedily restored to the
dullest blades.
Price, 5/-; by Post, 5/4.
DURHAM DEMONSTRATOR OUTFIT.
The phenomenal popularity of the DURHAM
DUPLEX SAFETY RAZOR, sold the world over for
21/- has led to the introduction of
THE DURHAM DEMONSTRATOR.
The Razor is made specially for DURHAM
DUPLEX BLADES, and, except for the handle, is
identical with the high-grade Duplex.
The DURHAM DEMONSTRATOR, like the Durham
Duplex, incorporates the best points of the old-
style Razor, and the advantages of the safety guard
and interchangeable Blades.
The DURHAM DEMONSTRATOR RAZOR affords
the correct sliding diagonal stroke, together with a
safety guard and interchangeable blades, and, there-
fore, enables you to shave correctly and with safety.
It does not cut you—-neither does it scrape or pull.
DURHAM DUPLEX BLADES are manufactured of
the finest carbonised steel, correctly tempered, ground
on two edges, and perfectly honed and stropped. The
blades may be stropped by using the blade-holder
attachment. When a blade loses its keenness, strop it,
or use a new one.
DURHAM DEMONSTARTOR RAZOR OUTFIT, com-
prising Silver-plated Set, consisting of Razor, Safety
guard, Stropping Attachment, and six Double-edged
Hollow-ground Durham Duplex Blades of finest tem-
pered steel.
Complete in Box, 6/6; by Post, 6/9
DURHAM DUPLEX RAZOR BLADES, 2/6 PER
PACKET OF SIX.
By Post, 2d. extra.
THE REVO SAFETY RAZOR.

is packed in a flexible leather case, which will fit
the Vest Pocket. The frame and solid sanitary handle
are triple silverplated, and the toothless guard is
easily cleaned.
THE REVO is a boon to travellers, and the latest
product in the world of Safety Razors incorporating
improved features, which automatcally give the sliding
stroke anvle.
REVO BLADES are hand-stropped and hollow-
ground Norway Steel, converted into blades by a
process which ensures a keen, lasting edge.
REVO BLADES may be stropped time and again.
Price, with 7 Blades, 3/6; by post, 3/9.
Extra Blades, Packet of 6, price 1/6.
SAFETY RAZORS SHARPENED.
Save your 'old, thin Safety Razor Blades. After
they have passed beyond the stage of revival by
means of the ordinary strop, the Safety Blade Expert
can renew the keen edge of the hand-ground blade
with the patent, high-speed machine specially designed
for Safety Razors. It sharpens any thin, Safety
Razor Blade.

I am a living witness to the marvellous curative
properties of
VITADATIO
Eighteen years ago 1 was declared absolutely
incurable by three of the finest physicians in New
Zealand. 1 had suffered for fourteen years from
HYDATIDS
and had tried all the ordinary advertised
medicines, doctors, and herbalists, but without
any permanent benefit, and at last underwent an
operation, but was then pronounced incurable.
I was advised to try VITADATIO, and as a
result of giving this now famous medicine a
consistent trial, was thoroughly cured. My cure
took place seventeen years ago, and I am still in
PERFECT HEALTH
and have introduced this great medicine through-
out the world, and marvellous cures have been
effected by Australia’s Great Remedy in all
countries.

In these enlightened times everyone knows that disease attacks the system owing
to a poor quality of the Blood, and as VITADATIO is a natural herbal blood maker
it has successfully cured :

Cockle’s Pills regulate the system, tone up the liver and improve
the digestion, enabling the processes of the body to be carried out
quietly and steadily, while you remain blissfully unconscious of
their working and free to enjoy every moment of life. Cockle’s
Pills are made from the prescrip-
tion of the famous Dr. Cockle.
The first Steamship to
cross the Atlantic
was the “ Great Western ” which made her first
trip in 1838 taking 15 days on the voyage.
There can be little doubt but that she carried a
supply of Cockle’s Pills for they were the most
popular remedy in England at that time and their
fame was rapidly spreading all over the world.

The Roving Kilchen
As the result of experiments carried out at camps
of training', the military authorities have decided
that travelling kitchens are a practical advantage,
and it has been decided that a number of them shall
be purchased for distribution throughout Australia.
—News Hem.
And now a-down the rural roads the travel-
ling chef will go :
He’ll eat the bread live miles ahead though
ten back it was dough :
lie’ll boil the beef at Rillybong, the spuds
at Overflow.
'Phe creaking wheels will be attuned to some
old kettle song.
What time they turn, and ever turn, the
winding road along.
Retween the Army’s city base and Kangaroo-
-1 a.gong.
The roadside kids will gather from the
humpies where they dwell.
And watch tin l kitchen pass as though be-
neath some magic spell—
For where a kid and kitchen meet the world
goes wondrous well!
The lonely triulger in the dust will sniff from
out the breeze
The fragrance of the juicy roast, the glorious
scent of cheese.
And all the perfumes wafted out from boiling
pork and peas.
lie’ll breathe great mouthfuls of the air. and
lick his lips, and start
I’ursuing. like old Nemesis, that quaint old
jolting cart.
With emptiness behind his belt, but fullness
in his heart.
For in that travelling kitchen will his hopes
be set a-stack :
Y\ here all the roads lead out from home, but
seldom one leads back—
lie’ll even glimpse a wandering pub along
tin' Sunset Track !
And so in fancy I can see where rural road-
ways wind.
And where the wheels eternally the gleam-
ing gravel grind,
A joyful welcome far ahead—a hunger march
behind !
Ret s hope that where the ways are long, and
where the plains are wide.
That roving kitchen’s chef will keen l:is>
larder well supplied—
And we who plod the pinch-gut path be asked
to step inside!

THE TRUCE OF GOD AND THE
ABSURDITY OF MAN.
In days long gone by, when the arm of the
King was short, and his writ ran stiff, and
men often fended for themselves and slew
their enemies as occasion offered, the Roman
Catholic Church devised the Truce of God.
Private enmity was suspended from the
middle of Saturday to the middle of Mon-
day—just as if the rich city merchant was
taking the barmaiden to Manly for a week-
end. Later, the Truce of God was extended,
and private murder wasn’t allowed, under
penalty of the ban of the Church and the
reprobation of all decent people, between
Wednesday morning and Monday morning.
The Church knew that it couldn’t wholly
obliterate private warfare. The attempt
would have overset its authority. But it
endeavored to establish a restful interval.
In like fashion the embai-rassed Irish land-
lord of the period of George IV., William
IV. and the early days of Victoria, was a
“Sunday man.” He could go out on Sun-
day, that day representing his Truce of
God, when he was exempt from arrest for
debt. Now, by reason of the great war, a
Truce of God is proposed among politicians
in Australia. The idea is that parties in
the State and Federal Parliaments should
coalesce in a limited sort of way; and that,
while the military trouble lasts, political
differences should be drowned amicably in
the pot of patriotism. Matters which are
liable to lead to dissension, such as the
tariff, the loan problem, the route of the
Port Darwin railway, leasehold or freehold
distribution of public lands, Federal or State
ownership of railways, uniform railway
gauge, public or private steamship owner-
ship, the establishment of State-owned cities
on our neglected ports, and many other
matters which are liable to lead to quarrels
are to be set asid.e.
The question arises whether there may
not be too much Truce. Patriotism, in an
emergency, doesn’t wholly consist in a coali-
tion of parties, who will vote money for the
support of an expeditionary force, and sit
down hard to watch its departure, and cheer
when it leaves, and then do nothing save
offer the Empire their best wishes. Things
have to ’se done if the country is to be
kept in a state to carry its share of the wax-
burden, and to maintain its people during
the period of disorganisation which war
creates, even though the field of battle may
be a long way off. And if strife comes
right to our shores —which may happen, for
strife is an uncertain creature —a great
many things will have to be done. One
of the first griefs which struck Australia
when the guns began to go off was the
closing down of a number of mines which
have been in the habit of selling their
raw or partially refined products to Ger-
man manufacturers. There is no cause
why these products should not be dealt with
in Australia, or why this country should
depend on Germany, but through a fail-
ure in the tariff, or by reason of something
about which political parties have failed to
agree, this country depends largely on Ger-
many. And because Germany is our enemy
hundreds of good Australian citizens have
become unemployed and have to rely on
such assistance as the rest of the commu-
nity can render them. In a few more
weeks thousands of Australian citizens may
become unemployed for the same reason,
and be compelled to lie back against public
charity at a time when public charity isn’t
feeling very good itself because its divi-
dends have ceased. If the war lasts fox-
years the situation will become serious.
Supposing the Truce of God continues, and
Freetraders and Protectionists decide to
sink their differences about the tariff until
Peace reigns supreme, and devote them-
selves wholly in the meantime to watching
the . departure of troops, and refuse to
inquire, in profound respect for the Truce,
why so many Australians are out of work,
it may be a very fine and pious and patriotic
business. There is something beautiful in
the spectacle of political parties embracing
each other on the shore when the soldiers
set forth. But the pai-ties shouldn’t become
so friendly that they must cease arguing
about how to raise the money to pay for the
soldiers.
* * * *
The first days of the war have shown
that there is something rotten about Aus-
tralia’s tariff, or its loan nolicy, or its
manufacturing. policy, or its general
methods. It is obviously a public matter
of some sort. And if our Australian
political . patriots refuse to find out
how it is that the Germans can bring
so many Australian citizens —who are
also British citizens —to want by a brief
suspension of business, they are liable to
appear futile and wholly absurd.
* * * *
Australia is about as far away from the
sound of the guns as any other part of the
British Empire. It hasn’t seen a foreign
soldier on the horizon. It hasn’t heard the
report of a hostile rifle. The British terri-
tories haven’t been invaded, and the Mother
Country has been less heavily involved in
the war than any of its Allies. Yet Aus-
tralia’s loans can’t be floated at the old
address on anything like reasonable terms
because Europe wants its loose cash to
finance its armies. The unfinished railways
which are dependent on the loans may
presently be suspended, and that will
greatly ci-ipple the community. Even the
inrush of chiffons and picture hats and
giddy underwear is diminishing. Drapery
girls and such-like picturesque creatures are
being thrown out of work because we can
no longer sell goods to our enemies in order
that we may buy or borrow from our friends.
If Australia was a country which smelted
and refined its own ores, made its own
Woollens and cottons and silks, built its own
clothes and hats and boots, constructed its
own rails and locomotives and ships, paid its
way out of its own revenue (or at least
floated its own loans), and did what trade
was essential with its own vessels, this
remote scuffle iu Europe Wouldn’t have
begun to affect it yet. Australia Would
have at least 30,000,000 people instead of
less than 5.000,000. It would be able to
supply 100,000 trained soldiers for the
defence of the Empire instead of 20,000
volunteers. And it wouldn’t look iu the
eye of public insolvency because of the
debts that are falling due.
The whole matter of imperial patriotism
consists in building up Australia so that
it will be a strong, solvent, self-dependent
section of the British Empire. If it is to
go to pieces whenever Germany can’t buy
its ores and Britain can’t lent it money
with which to buy foreign underclothing,
and France and Belgium can no longer pur-
chase its wools because the men employed
in their woollen factories have gone to the
war, then Australia is a mere pauper and
parasite. If peace between local parties
means the abandonment of any attempt
to find out why this country is of such
small value, it might be better to go back
to the old party strife and call the Truce
of God a failure.
The present state of things might be
expected to lead to a great increase in
Australian manufactures, a great decrease
in Australia’s dependence on German ore-
buyers and Hebraic money-lenders, and a
vast advance in the country’s population.
But no one can be expected to put up huge
factories in which to manufacture the goods
which we can’t at present get from Europe,
or to treat the raw products which we
can’t at present sell to Europe, if the coun-
try is to go back to the old, slovenly, ineffi-
cient order of things as soon as the war
is over. Then the new factories, would be
a bad debt and the new industries would be
dead. Our chance of being a really for-
midable section of the Empix-e would again
depend on our luck in selling crude ores
abroad and our chance of borrowing money
in foreign parts. Also the Sydney Tele-
graph and the Herald and the Bruce
Smith party would probably go back to
their old attitude, and preach the old doc-
trine that we should devote ourselves to the
production of raw material, such as hides ,
and timbpr, and depend on more “advanced”
nations like Kaiser William’s country for
the products of a higher civilisation.
* * * *
The situation, So far as The Bulletin
can see it, is embodied in these few proposi-
tions :
(1) Out of an intense regard for the Empire which
is holding up a good cause against Germany there is
to be a Parliamentary peace, and all the ordinary
controversies, of which the fiscal controversy is the
chief, are to be hung up.
(2) Therefore no effort is to be made to find out
why such a large proportion of the Australian mining
population depends on a hostile race to boil down
its products, ond is faced with hunger as soon as the
hostile race becomes unusually hostile.
(3) Or to find o.'t why it must simply sit down
and keep on hungering till the foe is pleased to leave
off being- hostile.
(4) Or to discover why the greatest wool-produc-
ing country in the world is to have its wool left
on hand as unsaleable stock, and (if the war proves
to be a matter of long duration) to clothe itself in
old bags.
(5) Or to ascertain why a great gold-producing
country is liable to become a crippled member of the
British power because it can no longer borrow gold
from places which don’t prod’'" l -Id.
(6) Or to inspect the reasons why its railway
system, which is a very conspicuous feature of its
share in defence, is rendered so inefficient by reason
of diverse gauges and divided control.
(7) Or to look into a multitude of other things.
Australia doesn’t want, at this crisis, to
have Ministries shoved out to-day and
shoved in to-morrow by reason of the old
political controversies. But there was
never a time when it could less afford to
drop these controversies, because, unless
the tariff que,- tion and the borrowing ques-
tion, and the question of State or Federal
railway ownership and the problem of
the route of the Port Darwin railway
and a number of other matters are
decided in haste, Australia may, before
the conflict ends, be wholly incapaci-
tated from doing its duty. Therefore this
paper again puts in its plea for the Elective
Ministry on the Swiss pattern. That sort
of Ministry would be fixed in office for
three years, whether its measures were
rejected or not. Therefore it could deal
with every question which bears, however
indirectly, on the efficiency of Australia,
and get a Parliamentary decision upon it,
without the risk that sudden changes of
portfolio-holders would create trouble at a
Ume when trouble should be avoided. The
Truce of God is a great idea, provided it
is carried out logically. Let us, for once, be
logical. There is nothing in the written
law. to prevent every Legislature in Aus-
tralia electing a Ministry with a proviso that
it will last as long as the Legislature lasts.
[James Edmond, 214 George-street, Sydney.)
THE ALLEGED NEW POLAND.
Russia’s political methods are often
regarded as coarse and heavy and bear-like,
and plantigrade, yet the Big Cold Country
strikes the right moment about as often as
anybody else. It was announced the other
day, in a quiet sort of fashion, that Home
Rule would be granted to Russian Poland.
Whereupon Russian Poland sat up and sang
the local National Anthem, and became more
enthusiastic about the supply of men to the
Russian army that it ever was before. Inci-
dentally Austrian and Prussian' Poland
were necessarily seized with the idea that it
might be a good thing to be attached to
Russia, and to form a part of a resurrected
and autonomous Polish State, with its own
army and a large measure of its own Govern-
ment, and with the Czar as sovereign.
Poland has no old royal family of its own,
like the Stuarts or the Bourbons or the
Orleans crowd, or the that
it wants to restore. The Jagellons and
the Sobieskis are long since extinct. They
represented, in a sort of fashion, hereditary
ruling races, but they were an exception.
Most of the later Polish kings were mere
elected shadows. Often, like Stephen
BaThorY, and WENceslas of Bohemia, and
Plenry of Valois, and Sigismund of Sweden,
and Augustus of Saxony, they were for-
eigners. No one in Poland wants nowadays
to hunt up a Poniatowskl and restore the
traditions of the last monarch, for if there is
any Poniatowskl left he is probably a
decayed person living in a boarding-house.
With Uo old kings to fight for, the Polish
pride will probably be fairly well satisfied
with a local legislature and a local defence.
The offer of these concessions will almost
certainly put a charge of dynamite under a
corner of the house in Austria and Germany.
* * * *
Two countries which have suffered greatly
through the ignorance of people whose infor-
mation is 50 years old are Russia and Aus-
tralia. There are still folk who fancy that
almost everybody in Russia is sent to Siberia,
and that almost everybody in Australia is a
convict sent out from England, -and duly
flogged on arrival. The information is less
accurate than it might be. The Polish
masses, despite all their wrongs and hard-
ships have always had some traces of kindly
feeling towards Russia. When Frederick
the Great, of Prussia, proposed the First
Partition it was Russia which tried to keep
together the miserably decayed State—a
Slate which had made the payment of taxes
a voluntary matter, and allowed its army
and police and courts of justice to disband
for lack of salaries, and left its king with
no means of living save what he could borrow
from foreign ambassadors, and established
complete liberty—even the right of insurrec-
tion, for its 200,000 “nobles.” and complete
slavery for almost everybody else. Russia
'tried in a high-handed fashion to prop up
and reform this amazing wreck of anarchy
and beggary and lawlessness, so that it might
be a buffer against Frederick. Having failed,
it stole all of Poland that it could get, on
the simple and obvious plea that if Prussia
secured the lot its guns would almost com-
mand St. Petersburg, and the need to keep
the Prussian guns a long way off was plain
to the humblest understanding. If the
Polish carcase couldn’t defend itself, mainly
because of the treasons and dissensions of
its innumerable “nobles,” somebody had to
bury it.
Russian Poland was allowed, for a number
of years after the conquest, to have its own
'Parliament of a sort —-composed, unfortu-
nately, of the same old “nobles” —and its
own army, and a considerable measure of
Home Rule. In this respect it received
better treatment than the other divisions of
the unfortunate country. The methods
might be crude and uncouth, but they were the
methods of the time, and were the methods best
known at the time. It was only when the
amazing horde of “nobles” proved utterly
unmanageable that Russia fell on them like
an avalanche. Some of them went to
Siberia. Some went to Paris and London
and became music-teachers and dancing-
masters. This gang of dispossessed slave-
owners was so vast that many people mis-
took it for the whole Polish nation gone into
exile. Meanwhile the lands of the exiles
were to a great extent divided among their
serfs, and the real Pole —the unlettered, in-
articulate toiler, who couldn’t write patriotic
verse or deliver heroic speeches, and who
had mostly lived in a hole underground—
began to get a show. He hated the Russian
because he was of a foreign race and a
s trahge religion, and because liis policeman
was arrogant and his soldier not too kind.
Vet,. by way of a sort of under-current, he
realised that the Russian had released him
from slavery to some extent, and put him in
the way of having three square meals per
day—or at least two. Also he occasionally
had a drink, thouglj the liquor wasn’t of the
best.
* * * •
The habit of lamenting about the wrongs
of the expatriated Polish noble,' 1 in his capa-
city of Polish patriot, gradually declined.
The nations of Western Europe grew tired
of trying to spell his name, which was mostly
16 consonants and one vowel; and sometimes
he had sense enough to call himself Brown
or Smith or Boleslas McDougal, and to
sink liis -lost dignity and his ancient unin-
telligibleness. Even the British Government
became weary of paying allowances, however
small, to the outcasts, and giving them
house-room in barracks, such as Walter
Besant described the situation when he
wrote “By Celia’s Arbor.” So the outcasts
began to get work. They grew less and less
sanguine over their policy of rushing occa-
sionally back to Poland and calling the people
to arms, because the people became less and
less inclined to take up the cudgel and the
scythe, and follow their incompetent
decayed old proprietors in hopeless in-
surrections. . The Polish provinces developed,
in time, into the richest and most
densely-peopled section of the Russian
Empire. Their position was far better, so
far as material comfort went, than in the
days of the old squalid independence. Still,
there always remained the Russian police-
man and the feeling of conquest and subor-
dination.

If a new Polish Legislature is established,
based on a wide suffrage, instead of the old
Diet of “nobles,” it will probably shake up
Central Europe in a surprising fashion. The
great ambition of the Poles is to get as much
as possible of their old kingdom together
again, and Russian Poland may become the
rallying point. This isn’t a time when either
Austria or Germany wants any section of
its subjects to find a rallying-point under a
hostile flag. Poland may prove another Ire-
land, with this difference —that the north-
eastern section of Ulster may be fighting to
get into the Home Rule movement , rather
than fighting to stay out of it. Therein lies
no small difference, and when Europe is full
of differences it must annoy our enemies to
strike a fresh one.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Spirit that Makes Revolutions.
The Sydney Telegraph was responsible for
the following indisputable bit of horse-sense
last week
A crisis like the present will always discover a
type... .anxious to discover how they may selfishly
turn the public difficulty to their own advantage. In
a neighboring State the carcase butchers announce
that they will have to raise the price of meat....
It is they and their like who in every country make
the Socialists and inflame the mad passions of
anarchy.
In the same issue appeared a report of the
annual meeting of the shareholders of the
Australian Gaslight Co., at which it was
announced that though dividends of 9 per
cent, were to be paid on the A and B
shares, and of 7 per cent, on the C shares;
though the said dividends included income
tax charges, and so freed individual share-
holders from further liability in this direc-
tion ; and though there was the tidy balance
of £11,545 IDs. 7d. to be carried forward,
after the paying of the above-quoted divi-
dends, yet the price of gas was to be in-
creased to 3s. lOd. per 1000 . feet. The
A. G. Co. is in a far more favorable position
than the Melbourne carcase butchers, from
many points of .view. Its monopoly is prac-
tically complete. People can do without
fresh meat for weeks, and suffer no serious
inconvenience. Gas the majority of them
simply must have. The butcher who sup-
plies bad meat is shunned; if it is very bad
he is prosecuted. If he over-charges, his
customers deal elsewhere. Debtors let 'him
in, and legal redress is liable to be more pro-
fitless, so far as he is concerned, than bitter,
though futile, blasphemy followed by in-
action. The A. G. Co. is in a position to
supply whatever sort of gas it likes; and
some of its goods are very, very bad. The
variety, for example, that the writer has
been paying for during this winter failed
miserably, most of the time, to warm the
heater of his humble bathroom. If there is
any delay in settling up for this absurd ser-
vice a “collector,” without the courtesy, bul
with roost of the other characteristics of a
professional blackmailer, transpires and
makes things unpleasant. If there is further
delay the gas is cut off and the payment of
an impost is required before it is turned on
again. So about the only bad debts the A. G.
Co. ever incurs are in connection with those
who are prepared to go back to wood-stoves
and lamps. The country is faced, at the
present time, as the Telegraph notes, with
a crisis. The latter is inevitably going to
become more acute as time goes on. Sydney
—which is to say the region where the A. G.
Co. operates—is bound in the nature of
things to feel the trouble worse than most
other centres, if only because, being the seat
of Government, it must be the bourne of the
State’s unemployed. And in this place and
at this time one of the most prosperous
monopolies in the Commonwealth considers
that it is a fair thing to hoist out of all
reason the price of the necessary which it
purveys. The fact that the Telegraph
chides the carcase butchers of a “neighbor-
ing State” but has not a word of blame for
the A. G. Co. of its own city is characteristic
of the local Liberal mind. The oppressive-
ness of the meat-sellers is new, and hence
dreadful; that of the gas-dealers is justified,
not to say sanctified, by yeai;s of usage. As
a matter of fact, there is a certain amount
of justification for the action of the carcase-
butchers. The war in Europe has occasioned


an extraordinary demand for meat, and the
carcase men have to pay more for the stuff
which they retail, in proportion as an un-
usual quantity of it is being shipped abroad.
But there is no export of gas. The gas in-
dustry is one of those which is in no way
prejudiced by the trouble on the other side
of the world. The N. S. Wales Government
is here offered an opportunity to do the com-
munity a useful service. Prices of neces-
saries. are being legislatively fixed in all
directions. What is wrong with Parliament
fixing the price of gas in Sydney at a reason-
able figure—one that would give the A. G.
Co. a fair return (say, an average of 7 per
cent, for all classes of shareholders), and
at the same time free the country from the
possible inflammation of “the mad passions
of anarchy”?
A Tariff Side-Issue and Some Sundries.
In time-off trouble 'Broken Hill lias' a habit
of getting in early with its own concerns.
Lately the local A.M.A. demanded that the
directors of those mines which have ceased
operations should be compelled to resume.
Not a word was said about the fact that the
fiscal-sinking policy, or semi-Freetrade policy,
for which Barrier Laborites have done their
full share,, has prevented Australia becom-
ing the great metal-refining country it should
be, and has compelled many of the mines to
depend on the German market —now closed —
for the sale of their concentrates and for the
money to pay wages with. If the directors
don’t resume work it was requested that the
Government should take over the mines and
work them. But if the Government does
that it must face one of two alternatives. It
may stack a vast quantity of unsaleable pro-
ducts till the war is over, and meanwhile
pay wages out of extra taxation at a time
when extra taxation is a difficult problem.
Or it may establish ore-refining works "of its
own, which promise to be something very like
a bad debt when the war is finished imless
the tariff is radically altered, and these
Broken Hill folk say nothing about an inten-
tion to abandon fiscal sinking and to support
tariff reform. As a third alternative it was
proposed that the Holman Ministry should
provide work for the Broken Hill toilers and
moilers by immediately commencing to build
the Menindie-Barrier railway. Unfortunately
the Holman Government, with abundant
support from Broken Hill, has turned dog oh
its old Labor pledge that it would reduce
borrowing, and learn how to do the great
bulk of its public works out of revenue. It
has become —with the support of Broken
Hill—a foreign loan Government pure and
simple. It doesn’t know how to be anything
else, and now that foreign loans are scarce
it is little use for Broken Hill to demand
that it should make bricks without straw.
Then, in addition to demanding that work
should be as abundant and as well-paid as
usual, the local A.M.A. urged that the
price of provisions should not be raised,
even if they were imported provisions and
the price was raised at the other end. And
it suggested that everybody on the Barrier,
including single men who occupy lodgings,
should cease to pay rent, and that time-
payment furniture instalments should leave
off till the scuffle at the far end of the globe
is over. If the concessions are granted, then
the A.M.A. folk at Broken Hill will make a
solid dividend out of their country’s troubles
and the Empire’s troubles. They will be the
unpaid rent and unpaid furniture instalments
to the good. No doubt the Hill is a dry,
lone, weary, dusty, depressing place where it
is difficult to cultivate the finer emotions,
yet the lack of these emotions may be carried
too far. The female —she is generally a
female, and sometimes possesses a baby—who
lets rooms to bachelor miners will have a
dismal time if her rent is stopped indefinitely,
and the furniture man’s clerk and rouseabout
will have very little dinner on Sunday should
the instalments leave off. Just here it may
be noted that nothing was said by the A.M.A.
about making any special effort on behalf of
Australia if, as demanded, it got plenty of
work and a stoppage of rent. The proposi-
tion lias a one-sided aspect somehow.

War and Business.
“10-2-4” — his sentiments :
Someone wrote to the S. M. Herald last week to
ask if the upheaval in Germany was “a capitalists’
war.” The answer was as follows: —
To talk of “a capitalists’ war” at this juncture is
merely to utter sounds without meaning. The capi-
talist has always feared this particular war more than
anything else in the world, except, perhaps, Social-
ism If anything is clear in the world, it is that
this war is the outcome of racial differences, which
have nothing whatever to do with wealth or the
absence of it.
The sounds without meaning appear to the writer to
emanate from the Herald. Most wars are business
wars, and if ever there was a “capitalists’ ” or
“trade war” this is surely one. The Servians have
loathed Austria for generations, not so much on
racial grounds (millions of Franz Joseph’s subjects
are their fellow-Slavs) as for the sordid reason that
the Servian capitalists, big and little, in the pig
industry have been financially harassed by the Dual
Monarchy’s tariff, and by its refusal to let them have
a free path for their products to the world outside
via an Adriatic port. The Servians who engineered
the slaughter of the Archduke Ferdinand played a
subtle part from their country’s viewpoint. They
not only robbed Austria of the one possible ruler
who could have held the two kingdoms together—
the man who had created, single-handed almost, the
Empire’s present Army and Navy—but they also
brought the enemy of their nation’s chief business
into conflict with the rest of Europe. The motive
power at the back of the general conflict, like that
at the back of the particular row between Austria
and Servia, was, again, not racialism, but trade,
business, capitalism or whatever else one may choose
to call it. Who thinks of the Pan-Slav issue now?
It is Germany against the world, Slav and otherwise.
Germany’s amazing Emperor is up to nis neck in
one of the bloodiest gambles that was ever known,
not on a point of racial sentiment, but in a frantic
reach after trade. That his hand has been forced,
that he is reaching months, perhaps years, before he
intended to, is plain from various indications. For
example, the rate in the German State Banks has been
extraordinarily low—often as low as 3i per cent. —
during the past 12 months; and cheap money, and a
resulting depletion of the national gold reserve, is
the last thing Berlin would have allowed had war
seemed imminent. But there is no doubt that when-
ever the position appeared favorable Germany meant
to fight—for the colonies which it hasn’t got; in
bri. ) for trade or capital. Germany has notori-
r =ly been prepared for years to fight Britain for
Africa, and France for the latter’s colonies, and for
security of tenure as regards Alsace-Lorraine. (Aus-
tralia it doesn’t want.) The position wasn’t particu-
larly favorable to Germany when it butted furiously
into the present dispute—one with which it had, on
the surface, no connection whatever. But it was
more favorable than it was likely to be for decades
to come.
Consider the circumstances. The Archduke
Ferdinand —a War Lord of sorts, a naval and mili-
tary enthusiast, one who might have made a great
cohesive ruler, and who would certainly have been
an impressive figurehead—had been killed. The old
Emperor may die any day, and Ferdinand being
dead, his successor will be a boy who has not been
even heard of by most of the nation. It is agreed
by all the experts that the last Balkan War caused
a 50 per cent, depreciation in the value of Austria-
Hungary as an ally. With Franz Joseph gone and
a feeble youth at the head of things, the troubled
empire might well have depreciated the other 50
per cent. Germany’s only hope of colonial expansion,
within the lifetime of the present Kaiser, was plainly
to strike while Austria was still of some value. And
so Germany struck. Its position is the burglarious
one of wanting some valuable property which a neigh-
bor possesses, and being determined to seize the
same, whatever the risk, while the chances seem
brightest. Had the Archduke’s death not precipi-
tated the necessity for the great steal, Germany’s
intention was to greatly strengthen both its navy
and its army during the coming two years—a pur-
pose which was indicated by the recent elevation of
the financier Kuhn to the Secretaryship of the
Imperial Treasury. The business of Kuhn was to
advise as to the best way of raising the necessary
millions, and financing the armament expansion
scheme generally.
To sum up, the present war is essentially a busi-
ness one, as regards the nation which is really to
blame for it. It will unquestionably ruin many
capitalists of all nationalities. All wars do. But,
on the other hand, it will make fortunes for other
capitalists—as every war does. If Germany loses,
the British Empire will keep its existing trade, and
probably get the trade of various German colonies
into the bargain. Also, the other members of the
Entente will benefit, in a financial sense, and Servia
will be able to export its pigs free of tariff inter-
ference from Austria, and in other respects the
winners will be richer than they were. If Germany
wins, it will be immeasurably richer, which prospect
is the sole reason, \Vhen all is said an'd dbnle, for its
entry into the present appalling struggle. Nations
don’t differ much, in the essentials, from individuals.
National pride is largely a matter df national wealth.
The same sentiment which inspires a man to amass
millions impels his country to amass colonies. If
Germany is reduced to the rank of a third-rate
Power, as a result of the present war, the truest
epitaph that could be inscribed on the stone ’at the
head of its dead greatness will be: “Another Victim
of the Get-rich-quick Habit.”

Our Daily Lies.
The language of “O. C. Cabot” :
Consider the rumors of the war, how they grow.
They cease not, night or day. The papers cannot
longer manufacture or cultivate them, but the
blitherer known as the Man in the Pub circulates
“cables” and “special messages” which leave pro-
bability comatose and possibility gasping for breath
(or beer).
The most pretentious, absurd and circum-
stantial lie of the last week or 10 days I give
from my' own experience in the reverberating and
crepitating city of Sydney. It started on August 6
with the account of a battle in the North Sea
between the British and German fleets. My infor-
mant (the first of 17 dittoes) gave the figures of
loss as 13 British Dreadnoughts and 13,000 men;
Germany, 21 Dreadnoughts and 23,000 men. No
small craft referred to. This rumor did heavy
work until about 11 a.m. on the next day, when it
shrank a little. I was then informed by 251 persons
(not all at once, but before five o’clock in the
afternoon) that the British had lost eight Dread-
noughts and the Germans 13 ! The loss of personnel
was kindly omitted. On Sunday night we were all
dragged out into the cold (I live at an altitude of
3400 ft., and in August the Sunday nights are dashed
chilly), and told that “special word” had come from
the lying old city of Sydney to say that the
“British loss was definitely known” as 14 Dread-
noughts and “about” 17,000 men; while the miser-
able Germans had been sent Below to the tune of
23,000 in 32 ships—presumably Dreadnoughts! By
this time I had got hardened, and simply asked our
informant whether he was sure it was only 32 Ger-
man ships. He said he thought so. On the follow-
ing morning 2761 people in Pitt- and George-streets
told me (during the day) that 11 British battleships
had “gone” ; also that the German Navy had been
“entirely wiped out.” On Tuesday a total eclipse
of the lie occurred ; 17,880 people from the Central
Railway Station down to the Quay agitatedly re-
marked that “a disaster” had struck J. Bull’s big
fleet right on the Dogger Bank. The news was so
bad that the Admiralty, the authorities, Garden
Island and the Salv’army Headquarters had unani-
mously refused to give the least publicity to the
facts. I had two drinks on the strength of this
awful defeat, to put myself right with the world,
and got a friend to pinch me hard in two places.
(I am sorry to say he pinched me in three places—-
one for half a crown.)
The news steadily got worse for the next
two days. The fact (?) that the Australia
was sunk off Norfolk Island, on Wednesday,
added nothing of real importance to the information
which had got Sydney (and I assume the rest of the
Commonwealth) down, and when I returned to the
village on Port Jackson I was quite prepared for the
worst. In fact (or fiction), I positively apprehended
the “authoritative announcement” that the German
Pacific fleet was even then shelling Manly or Pfah-
lert’s Hotel —two spots, though occasionally lost to
sight, to memory always dear. But, cher Monsieur
(that’s French), picture my relief- —my transports—
on learning from 28,991 people—lingering in the
vicinity of the pubs, tramsheds, newspaper offices
and churches of the metropolis—that “good news had
come!” It seemed (this would be last Thursday)
that the Governor-General and the Minister for
Loans (I mean Works) had received “an official
cable” from London, or Lowestoft, or Lourdes, or
some place commencing with “L,” to the effect that
“there had been a great battle in the North Sea.”
Hastily dashing out, I purchased seven different
“war” editions of the most religious papers in sight.
Violently dashing in, I searched them hard for
details —much as an old woman searches her blanket
for the 'nimble flea. All that the most rigorous
scrutiny could detect was a few lines which said
that the “German fleet was bottled up, somewhere
in the North Sea.” Putting up a prayer that Some-
body would keep his thumb on the cork of the
bottle, I retired to the mountains for the night. But
even there the war and rumor of war ceaseth not
from the uprising of the Sun even unto the going
down of the S. M. ’Erald. On Friday (to-day —
this very moment that, tremblingly I write you,
cher Monsieur (Vive La France!), 156,927
persons have, are, or will be told, telling
or informing me that it is true that
“there has been a great battle in the North Sea.”
The last report is that there “has been a victory” ;
Admiral Jellicoe and Prince Albert, the King’s
young son, the most prominent (and improbable)
among the “dead” who number 12,000; also, “we
have lost six ships, including two super-Dog-
boxes.” The Germans are out; nothing less; their
“loss” is 33 ships, and “ALL their Dreadnoughts!”
Well, thank Heaven, the “truth” is out at last.

“H.”: Last week a whisper went around
the saloon bars that in the near future
w-bisky and soda would cost ninepence per
nip. Pray Joss it may be so! A fortnight
previously John M. Joshua, of Joshua
Brothers, appeared before the Inter-State
Commission with a request that the duty
on proof whisky be increased from 14s. to
17s. per gallon. He explained that the
protection for blended whisky, under the
preference clause, was only 2s. per gallon.
Pure malt whisky and pot-still whisky had
a protective margin of 4s. per gallon, but
as no one drank them it made no real differ-
ence. Popular taste, these days, runs to
blended whisky. Given a duty of 4s. per
gallon on “blended whisky.” and the Aus-
tralian-made goods would boom. As it is,
the firm , distills only once in three years,
and has never succeeded in selling within 20
per cent, of its capacity, which is 400.000
gallons per year. So every good Australian
will fervently pray (in fact, he will pray
twice) :
(1) That Joshua Bros, have on hand a very large
stock of Australian whisky.
(2) That the price of imported whisky rises to
ninepence per nobbier.
Incidentally, Norman Shelley, wine and
spirit merchant, declared that it would cost
a heap" of money to break down the preju-
dice against Australian whisky. Maybe;
yet there was just as strong a prejudice
against Australian brandy, until the doctors
ordered the South Australian spirit to be
used in the hospitals, on account of its
purity. Then the prejudice began to dis-
appear and went on disappearing. Inter
alia, Shelley remarked that if a higher
duty were imposed on blended whisky, he
would consider the advisability of starting
it whisky-mill. On that admission alone it
looks as though Australia couldn’t do better
than give the higher duty a chance.

In view of the fact that this is a day of
stress; considering the circumstance that
the gold reserve of the country should be
economised if Australia is to be in a posi-
tion to do its duty to the empire: keeping
an eye on the obvious proposition that
bankers are loyal and devoted citizens; not
forgetting the plain and naked and unvar-
nished event that this isn’t a time to throw
dirt at the solvency of the Australian
Government, especially when it is doing its
best to hold up the British flag—viewing all
these matters dispassionately, will the man-
agers of Australian banks lay in a big supply
of handy Australian notes (£5 and £1 and
10s.) and offer them, also press them, in
payment of all demands, only supplying gold
when gold is absolutely asked for? That
would do more to help this country through
the crisis than the delivery of 1000 speeches
and the waving of 20,000 belltoppers. There
are too many speeches and the waving of
belltoppers becomes a weariness. No bell-
topper ever killed a German soldier. If
every man will do what littlte he can in
his own line df industry, instead of drawing
diagrams in beer on the bar-counter of a
pub, showing the position of the Belgian
army, he will be a better patriot. Bank
managers who are prepared to attempt
their little bit in support of the Common-
wealth and the Empire are invited to roll
up.

The Melbourne Argus, being apparently
unable, for the moment, to secure an
imported match with which to light its
imported cigar, has wailed thuswise: —
The safety-match position is only another of those
unfortunate shortages which have upset business in
that article so often during the past five years.
Importers have always been careful to have as moder-
ate stocks of imported matches as possible, realising
that it was only a matter of time when with the
assistance of the duty the Australian article would
destroy the necessity of importing matches. The
extraordinary thing is that each time an interruption
to supplies of imported matches has occurred our
factories have failed to cope with the position. Some
contracts for Australian matches are already behind
as it is.
The position appears simple. The tariff
being inefficient it has been “a matter of
time” till Australia would be able to supply
itself with matches. This country was a
man sitting on two stools, or an ass hovering
between two stacks of hay. The local sup-
plies were insufficient because the tariff
wasn’t quite good enough, and the imports
were insufficient because the tariff wasn't quite
bad enough. When the imports were parti-
ally cut off it was held as a grievance against
Protection that our insufficiently-protected
match manufacturers didn’t, inside a Week,
put up works capable of supplying ali
tralia, with the chance that these costly
buildings would be a bad debt as soon as the
rush of cheap-labor imports got into full
swing again. There is much weariness and
exhaustion about this habit of regarding the
Australian worker as a person who must
stand around idle until, perhaps once in 20
years, the importing business strikes a snag,
and. then rush into the breach, and retire
again as soon as the blighted importer is able
to resume duty.

This is a time when, by reason of the war,
it is especially important to conserve the
gold reserves of the country. Therefore The
Bulletin asks once more whether there is
any Australian bank manager who is so pro-
German that he still refuses to stock the
Australian 10s. notes, and fails to instruct
his tellers that they must always offer Aus-
tralian Government notes, and only supply
the yellow metal when it is demanded? This
paper only knows three banks in Sydney,
apart from the Commonwealth institution,
which profess to keep the ten-bob note on
hand. It doesn’t know one which makes a
habit of offering payment in notes. There-
fore it has an idea of making out a list of
Sydney bank managers, and sending the same
to Kaiser William, with an intimation that
they are his good friends and allies. And it pro-
poses to get its Melbourne and Adelaide and
Brisbane representatives to make up similar
lists in their cities, and forward them for the
joy of Kaiser William. There was a time
in Scotland when the people resolved to
stand by their country by demanding notes
and thus saving the gold reserve, and they
did it so strenuously that the sovereign fell
to a discount as compared with the £1 bit
of paper. In other words, McDougall
McPherson and McTavisii decided that,
even if they couldn’t go personally to the
front, they would do their little bit in their
own little sphere, to help the nation. Aus-
tralia might do as much without injury.

Gregor McGregor, the Labor leader for
whom the Senate had a genuine affection,
died last week; and in South Aus. the
Senate election will be disturbed in conse-
quence, for no other Labor nominee can
now be put forward in his place. The
rough-hewn old man commanded universal
respeft because of his unfailing cheerfulness
and good temper under conditions which
would have broken most people. He had
been almost blind for over 20 years ; yet he
continued to be one of the best informed
members of the party. Every moment of
spare time he had in his little home on the
Adelaide foothills was filled in by some one
or other of his family reading to him —read-
ing anything, everything; reading and per-
haps re-reading till the patient listener had
stowed the facts away in his mind. In
that same mind he also kept a most amazing
collection of anecdotes, which made him a
popular speaker almost anywhere. Long
before the first Federal election, at which
he was successful, he had been one of the
Labor group in the local Leg. Council; in
fact, for 20 years he had continuously re-
presented Labor, and had never repre-
sented it anywhere but in an “Upper”
House. Though he was unable to take a
portfolio through his partial blindness —to
which was added in recent years increasing
deafness —he throughout led his party in
the Senate. There his wise old head kept
his followers out of many difficulties, while
his unfailing good humor and personal popu-
larity got them out of most of the others
that they fell or were pushed into.
Non Credo.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I rise from perusing the papers
Which sell at a penny a time,
(Our good old opinion-shapers
Which feature sensations and crime),
My sense of credulity scattered,
My faith in veracity fled,
My idols of rectitude shattered
And left in the gutter for dead.
(And the whole regrettable business is the
natural, in fact inevitable, outcome of study-
ing the war-neivs.)
Which moves me to cry to the mountains,
and likewise the plains and the hollows,
My newly-constructed “Non Credo,” the
substance of which is as follows -
I do not believe for a minute
That ninety of Germany’s craft
Invaded the Channel, and in it
Were challenged and raked fore and aft,
And finally captured and taken
To London as prizes of war.
My faith in such thrills has been shaken.
I now —though with grief—go so far
As even to question the story
That nineteen of Germany’s ships
Were blown, without mercy, to glory
When they and our fleet came to grips.
I do not believe that those over
From any great maritime scrap
Vre landing at Calais or Dover,
Or anywhere else on the map.
As a fact, to be brief.
If you want my belief,
It is this: There has been no such scrap.
I cast an eye of cold distrust upon the weird
narration
Of how a Gallic medico, while poisoning a
well,
With cholera bacilli, was—to everyone’s
elation —
Discovered by the other side, and promptly
given Hell.
I view with equal disbelief the circumstantial
stories
Of Germans shooting little girls and execut-
ing priests.
However dread an alchemist a European
war is,
It cannot, in a week, transform kind folks
to savage beasts.
I have my doubts that any son of Marshal
H. von Bieberstein
Remarked : “My country, ’tis for thee,” and
then fell down and died ;
And also that a Belgian lancer hurried from
his battle-line
And killed and captured Uhlans, single-
handed, far and wide.
The' Matin boasts that France does not
contain one Teuton warrior;
The Anzeiger that Paris will have fallen in
in a week ;
And both are lying hard. I know, though
which one is the sorrier
In this particular respect is somewhat hard
to seek.
I question if the Goeben exists,
And if the Breslau ever was afloat;
I doubt the so-called flight from Swakopund,
And that our foes left Windhuks in a
boat.
(In passing. I may mention, I am quite
prepared to find
That Swak and Windhuks both are myths,
or something of the kind.)
I class as liars all those sheets which claim
That prices have sone up in Berlin town.
I likewise give the lie direct to those
Who talk of prices being “fixed” or
“down.”
I even, in my frenzy, am nrepared
To prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt,
That Belgium’s not the Cock-pit of the
North! !
And so lay all the leader-writers out.
And, finally , if the press-lying which has
characterised the present trouble goes on
much longer, I am ready to support, with
cogent argument, the proposition that the
whole story about there being a European
war in progress is a fabrication, concocted
with the object of booming the circulation of
the newspapers.

One of the blights of genius which Muriel
Starr occasionally touches is her tendency
to gabble. Her voice has an extraordinary
intensity of appeal, but she does not inflect
it sufficiently for the sake of dramatic effect.
On Saturday evening, at the revival of
“Within the Law” at Sydney Criterion, this
defect was occasionally too apparent. Her
rapid delivery became monotonous. But she
is a great emotional actress, and Bayard
Veiller’s melodrama was an admirable
vehicle for her undoubted powers. Mary
Worth, in the part of a demure confi-
dence woman (all women are confidence
women), had the opportunities for character
acting cruelly denied her in “Madame X.”
Her work was delightfully finished. Gwen
Burroughs, however, proved a decided weak-
ness to the cast. Her impersonation of the
guilty saleswoman was on conventional,
colorless lines. In the scene where she is
supposed to be fainting with hunger it would
have required the production of two doctors’
certificates before the audit nee believed her.
E. W. Morrison repeated his faultless imper-
sonation of the forger Carson, achieving the
full pathos of his last scene with the most
delicate touches of artistry. Eric Maxon, who
failed to be as youthful as the author meant
him to be, showed again an unexpected
power in his emotional moments. His socks
were of the thinnest silk of the most
decollete, tendencies. Boyd Irwin remains
the one convincing detective on the contem-
porary stage; and if the New York police-
officers are not like Lincoln Plumer this
critic confesses himself disappointed with
the United States. Gerald Ilarcourt, as the
“stool pigeon,” was not an improvement on
the previous cast. But, on the whole, the
melodrama was disappointing, owing to the
failure to rehearse the final scene. This
scene occurs after the company has received
the flowers from the audience. The curtain
f°ll and rose, to disclose the star bowing on
the empty stage. The curtain fell again
and rose, invariably catching the star in an
attitude of modest surprise. It was evident
that she had not, for one moment, imagined
that the curtain-raiser would lift the rag
again. This little scene was repeated with
variations during the next six times the
curtain was raised. Either the curtain-
raiser sluuild be discharged for incompetency
or the actress should be sufficiently re-
hearsed.
War’s alarms have had little effect on “The
Girl in the Taxi” at Her Majesty’s, Sydney.
The vehicle has now been running for 10
consecutive nights, and the mileage is ex-
pected to be something tremendous before
the differential drops out or the carburetter
falls to pieces.
Le Roy, Talma and Bosco are still bright-
ening things up at the Palace (Sydney),
particularly since the new illusion and tab-
leaux', “To the Glory of France.” were pro-
duced. Naturally, this depicts the result of
Armageddon (not R. McGeddon, The
Bulletin verse-builder) in a manner suit-
able to local patriotism and the show cen-
sor’s idea of things. Fresh turns by the
supporting entertainers induce this paper
to retain its previous good opinion of them.
It was only visions of Fat and the Church
stampeding and tearing out their hair with
rage that made The Bulletin give up the
idea of coming out a day late this week in
order to include a sledge-hammer notice.
Therefore, since Wednesday was the first
night, Sydney Adelphi show is ordered to
come up for sentence next Thursday, and,
meantime, is bound over to keep the peace
without the option.
The Sydney Tivoli’s latest acquisition,
Harry Taft, who is billed as “America’s
famous whistling comedian,” has a whistle
that is more suited to a sheep station than
anvthing else, and a supply of talk that isn’t
suited to anything that this paper cares
about.. The Bulletin advises him to sit
down and listen to himself for half an hour
and then think it over. Meanwhile Cinque-
valli, boss juggler, is due on Saturday.
** * *
The daily afternoon performances at the
National Amphitheatre (Sydney) have
proved a winner for the Fuller-Brennan
firm. From the start the scheme caught on,
and nothing is likely to lessen its popu-
larity, except war depression. And, of
course, as there is no war depression for any-
body but Bill of Berlin, the present arrange-
ments will continue as usual.
All’s well at the Imperial (Sydney). The
tangoist threads his (and her) mazy way
and the ragger leapetli like the mountain
goat. Also, the box office keepeth its tail up.
Sydney Glaciarium’s annual corroboree,
“The Palace of the Golden Domes,” corrobo-
rates to-night.
Concerts and meetings “in aid of the War
Relief Fund” are the main interest of
Adelaide juft now. Evemthe visiting Science
men had to listen to a variety of patriotic
songs and speeches during their brief stay.
The massive, Salisbury-like Oliver Lodge
gave a fine (and quite intelligible-to-thc-
crowd) discourse on ether, but most of the
visitors were bent more on acquiring local
information than giving any. At the Tivoli is
Beth Tate, the American girl with a manner
that is demure and songs that are moder-
ately demure. Josh Dixon works hard at
his trade of comedian, and amuses many—
but not all. The Omega Three and Thornley
Dodge are just coming in. At the King’s
are a clever lot, singers and dancers mostly,
and Deaves’s “mannikins” from the U.S.A.
This little theatre has caught the public
fancy strongly. “Her Luck in London”
(Anderson Co.) has also nothing to com-
plain of in the nublic patronage at the Royal,
but a good military drama would go much
better just now. Branscombe’s “pink” co.
of Dandies has started a short season at
the Town Hall, and army and navy films
continue to do good service at Wondergraph,
West’s, Pav. and Empire.
The last-but-one-week of the Gil-Sul sea-
son at Her Majesty’s (Melb.) has brought
the sweet, familiar melodies of “Patience”
back to local hearing, and the fact that
even a British dook can get tired of toffee
is once more in evidence. “Patience” calls
more attention than some of the other operas
to the want of personal attractiveness in
the chorus. The 20 love-sick maidens (who
number only IS in this production) are
sufficiently unbeautiful to justify Bunthorne
and Grosvenor in the habit of walking ahead
of the ladies, and steadfastly resisting their
importunities. Also the 18 dragoon guards-
men suggest that the standard of the House-
hold Brigades is not what it used to be.
But the choral singing is quite satisfac-
tory, the orchestra admirable, and the well-
worn scenery blends with the music. As
for the principals, they were at least equal
oil Saturday to most of the opportunities
for a double-encore which a first-night per-
formance offers. Kavanagh, with his loud
military voice and swelling lower chest, gave
importance to the character of Colonel Cal-
verly. Frank. Wilson, who failed to look a
blonde and handsome Grosvenor with the
assistance of a brick-red wig, sang his songs
incisively. Arnold was a droll little Major,
especially in the famous posturing trio.
LEROY , TALMA AND BOSCO AT
SYDNEY BALACE.
Bosco, the human rabbit hutch .
McKeown did nicely as the toffeed Duke, and
Walenn’s sardonic little Bunthorne, being
rather insignificant, gave the other charac-
ters more apparent value than they had
when Howard Vernon’s tall impersonation
of the fleshly poet used to overshadow them.
In the name part, which needs clever acting
as well as singing, Miss Pearl Ladd lacked
nothing but a strain of essential melody in
her warble. Miss Ethel Morrison did fairly
well as Lady Jane, and the three leading,
rapturous maidens were not unduly bril-
liant. This is a company wherein nobody
ever casts a searchlight on the proceedings.
“Pinafore” is announced for the last five
nights of the season, beginning next Satur-
day. A week of panto, revival will follow.
“Bunty” struck an unsuitable time for
pulling the strings at Melbourne King’s.
The Scottish character comedy with the art-
lessly melodramatic plot would seem more
at home in piping times of peace, when the
haggis and the pibroch lie down together and
business is guid all round. Just now
“Bunty” is a very unseasoned dish to set
before the King’s, and although some of the
ingredients have virtues of their own, the
first-night feeders didn’t speak of the re-
freshment in a warm, advertising spirit.
“Bunty” came, however, with the intention
of staying six weeks, which is lots of time
for sincere admirers of the Graham Moffat
show to drag in their friends and persuade
them to acquire the taste. There are many
points of honest humor in the dialogue, and
minor incidents.
At Melbourne Royal the demand for “A
Royal Divorce” is unabated, and the roar of
the stage cannon will continue until further
notice. Julius Bonanarte’s reference to
the British bulldogs who “fight on, fight
on, fight on” is largely responsible for the
turning away of money on Saturday nights.
If he were to drop in a few remarks about
“brave Belgians” and German swank the
management might have six Saturdays and
three crowded matinees a week.
“The Glad Eye” will be looking for
patronage at Melbourne Princess’s on Satur-
day (22nd). Ten gentle strangers have
arrived from England to present “the funni-
est play within memory” to Australian
notice, and Willoughby, Ltd., in conjunction
with Beaumont Smith and Louis Meyer.
Leroy becomes enthusiastic over his
Entente Tableau.
will produce them on the date aforesaid.
Meanwhile Alien Doone is closing his season
with “Sweet County Kerry.”
The Melbourne Tivoli bill has already lost
Cinquevalli, if the advt. spoke truly, and
another principal item is already on the spot,
or may be expected immediately. Bar the
graceful old daddy of modern jugglery there
was nobody of particular note at the Tiv.
last Saturday. The Carpatii Bros, are one
clever gymnast in tights and another in
baggy pants, who labors to be funny. Welch
and Carbasse have a feeble sketch; the
Four Vags are singing no better than before;
and the Baroness continues to serve out
obsolete coon songs with the help of a well-
nourished tenor. Also, Dusty Rhodes
devotes a fine, fruity voice to witless ditties,
and Eugene Damond plays admirably on
his violin. None of these turns are excit-
ing.
West (Melbourne) is still publishing inci-
dents in the career of the late Queen Vic-
toria, omitting naught that will help to a
complete revelation of the lady’s stedginess
and respectability. The historical incidents
are generally well produced, but numerous
domestic pictures are rather spoilt by the
presence of an Albert the Good, played as a
languid burlesque of a Ouida guardsman
with most of his character in his feet.
Melbourne Bijou is now haunted by the
comfortable presence of Edward Blondell,
the much-advertised “Lost Boy” from Noo
Yark City. Edward’s turn is mostly a long
conversation with an unimpressive lady
accomplice, admittedly funny in spots, but
generally insufficiently droll to warrant its
discursiveness. The less-boomed Ray and
Ray are more laughable and more naturally
humorous, and even the rough, homespun
work of the Waldrons seems striking by
comparison. The two best acts on the
present Bijou bill are furnished by Carlton
Max, an accomplished ventriloquist, and
Juno Salmo, a singular contortionist got up
like a Mephistopheles at a fancy-dress ball.

Of midnight thirst within his mouth.
Intolerable is my drouth.
This tongue is like some fire-dried hob.

Who happens to require a beer.
Let me be absolutely clear.
You may entreat, rave, rant or sob,

Avail to wipe their stain away.

u* ™ 6S i heroine blackmail her parent,
bully her young bloke, talk like a suffragette,
and pry into everybody’s business, and then
asks us to believe in all her endearing young
charms. I was haunted all the time by the
vision of a middle-aged Bunty tyrannising
oyer a henpecked Weelum and winning the
dislike of the village by insisting upon “man-
agin the sewing bee, kirk choir, mothers’
nn }? P n an d every other movement for the
uplift of Lintiehaugh. When crossed by
her father, Bunty throws her keys on the
floor and tells him to get another house-
keeper, and when Weelum becomes restive
under her bossing she promptly returns her
engagement ring. The play ends prior to
her marriage, but I feel convinced that when
Weelum himself tried a little “managin’ ”
she tore up her marriage lines and left him
to grapple with the world, the flesh and the
haggis on his own, while she “managed” the
hoose of an elderly verger who would as soon
think of questioning her authority as of
playing the bagpipes on the Sawbath.
“C. Ockney”: Pinero’s latest play was
produced in London last month —a tragedy
called “The Bulkeley Peerage.” It proved
that every peerage is a tragedy. The chief
characters were Ponsonby Sweet (played by
Gerald du Maurier) and his wife, their little
boy, a detective and Lord Bulkeley—this
part falling to Australia’s old friend,
Edmund Gwenn. • The plot? It was all plot.
The Sweets plot to take Lord B.’s title, and
assure Sweet junior that some day he will
be a peer, at which the innocent youngster
asks, “Shall I have a pavilion at the other
end of me?” Lord B. is murdered by the
couple, asphyxiated with the help of a patent
stove. The detective then appears and in-
forms the guilty pair that, the night before,
Bulkeley had, with all his brother peers,
renounced his title and become a mere com-
moner ! Curtain. This giddy little piece
provided one of the sideshows at a theatrical
garden party, given in aid of the Actors’
Orphanage fund, and was the biggest success
that Pinero has scored of late.
“Harrison O.”: “C. Ockney” suggests
(B. 13/8/T4) that my yarn concerning the
improvisation of an opera by Teddy Solomon
and Sydney Grundy “is not quite correctly
given.” I don’t wish to be uncivil to “Ock.,”
blit I am impelled to state that he lies. I

am prepared to make an affidavit on this
point, or even, if necessary, to bet about it.
Still, preserving my temper and keeping
well within the frontiers of strict courtesy, I
furthermore mention that the insinuation
that Grundy would have required to be “hard
up” before collaborating with the clever
Yankee Yid is asinine. At this time Solomon
was trying to rival Sullivan, and many
thought, myself included, that he was going
to succeed. And whether “hard up” or not,
Grundy did collaborate with the Hebrew
musician in several operas, including “The
Vicar of Bray” and “Pocahontas,” which
was produced at the Empire in 1895. For
the latter piece Hayden Coffin was cast as
Captain John Smith, but, on the alleged
ground that he had had no operatic train-
ing, the part was wrenched from Coffin
almost at the last moment and handed to
Frank Celli. A few weeks later Coffin was
given his chance in “The Lady of the Locket”
(also by Solomon), and scored a sensational
success. These things have nothing to do
with the controversy, but they may help to
cow “Ockney” by showing him that he is
assailing me on a familiar topic.
Died the other week, Carlotta Addison,
who in her day was one of the sweetest and
best of comedy actresses in England. Her
young day was that of the Robertson and
H. J. Byron comedy, and she played the
sentimental heroine, as a rule, after which
she developed her art on graceful matron
lines. Her last appearance was in Bernard
Shaw’s “Pygmalion” at His Majesty’s
(London). When the old favorite actress
fell ill her place was filled at short notice
by the much-travelled Australian Nellie
Mortyne. But when, 10 days later, Miss
Addison died and another actress had to be
engaged for the rest of the season, manager
Tree chose Alma Murray for the vacancy.
The merits of the emergency lady didn’t
count. All that was the matter with her
was that her name wasn’t big enough.
“Allegretto”: The late Alice Charbonnet
Ivellerman took the musical world in Mel-
bourne and Sydney by storm with her musi-
cal fireworks. Even the dour musical critics
who suspected her of superficiality weren’t
proof against her youthful beauty, vivacity
and charm. Soon after arriving in Sydney
she married (why no one ever knew) a
N.S.W. public servant in a moderate posi-
tion. The more remarkable thing was that
she turned him into a high-class music
teacher. Their school in Darlinghurst
was, 30 years ago, Sydney’s leading
musical centre, and flourished for nearly 20
years. If the lady’s splendid energy hadn’t
wasted itself in amateur theatricals (for
which she fancied she had a genius) the
place might have lasted longer. As
it was the family struck hard times until it
shifted camp to Paris.
“C. Ockney”: Providing Europe quietens
down sufficiently to enable the mummers’
voices to be heard, London is in September to
see a revival of Barrie’s “Little Minister”
at the Duke of York’s. This is the piece
that gave Harry Rickards an opportunity
for an excursion into the “legitimate” some
16 years ago. Pattie Browne was the lead-
ing lady, playing the part that Winifred
Emery created in London —Lady Babbie.
Two of the original London cast are at pre-
sent in Australia —Eardley Turner and
Clarence Blakiston. The latter has yet to
make his first appearance here. He is
Nellie Stewart’s newest leading gent.
Eardley Turner has been to the front for
quite a while, and when he has nothing
better to do he writes verses for The
Bulletin. Incidentally, Tiie Bulletin
has never seen any reason to object to the
verses.
According to a just-issued British blue
book there were 9076 persons calling them-
selves actors in the Cold Country in 1911,
compared with 6044 in 1901; and in the
same period “actresses” increased from 6443
to 9179. The vaudeville profesli is stated
now -to give employment to 3213 male and
2445 female grease-painters.
H. B. Irving has got back to the
stage in London, in a play by
Stephen Phillips on the David and
Uriah theme. The idea is followed
closely, though the characters are
placed in Cromwell’s army. Colonel
David gives Captain Uriah a need-
lessly dangerous post—and marries
the widow. At the end, where the
child dies, Colonel David, recognis-
ing his sin, vows to “live ascetic-
ajiy” for the future —a thing which
the original David would never
have undertaken. The part does
not seem to have suited Irving.
The papers all say he was splendid,
of course; but one tells the truth
in this delicate fashion —“albeit his
great talents are not attuned to
the emotions of a passionate lover.”
There is no Borneo strain in any
Irving’s composition, somehow.
“Harrison O.”: Attended Melbourne Her
Majesty’s on the opening night of “Patience”
and lost mine because the principals seemed
to imagine that it was their place to be
seen and not heard. The words of the aver-
age musical comedy song do not matter
tuppence, but with a Gilbertian “lyric” the
words are of as much, and sometimes more,
importance than the music. Both the
heavenly twins —the one with his galloping
tiifcq, and the other with his long lines, diffi-
cult proper names and words of many syl-
lables —were apt to treat with scant con-
sideration those who had their songs to
sing-oh. A clear, crisp enunciation should
be insisted on in a Gilbertian comedian, and
it is what Walenn, the present frivoller-in-
chief, most conspicuously lacks. Frank
Wilson, in this respect, is the most satis-
factory member of the co., for he takes the
audience into his confidence from the jump,
and warbles like a man who has nothing to
conceal.
“Sr ”: A Melbourne show that to my
recollection lias never seen the “P.P.” column
is the Aquarium. Sole lessees and managers
are the Exhibition Trustees. The perform-
ing seals and dogs have always been with it,
and likewise a small supply of moving pic-
tures. Interspersed with these is a mild
sensation in the form of the Salome dance by
a nicely-shaped young lady, undressed beau-
tifully to the character. Whenever I get
down to Melbourne the Aquarium is my
first Sunday-show visit, and for the past
three years I have regularly met this particu-
larly nice Salome with the lights turned
down low. May her shadow never grow less
definite*
“Binnacle” : An unusual case was heard
in N.S.W. Vice-Admiralty Court this term,
when the crew of the N.S.W. Government
pilot steamer sued the' Chinese owners of
the barquentine Alexa for £2OOO and the
skipper handed up a claim for £lOOO on
account of salvage. One bad night in Jan-
nary last the Alexa broke away from a tug
right under North Head while entering Port
Jackson. The pilot vessel Captain Cook
answered its signals of distress and extri-
cated it from a dangerous position just

EXCITED PATRIOT: “Bravo! Hooray! Germany loses 8000 men. Hooray!”

when hope had been abandoned. All this
was practically admitted, but the case raised
an interesting point as to the liability of a
merchant vessel to pay salvage to a Govern-
ment vessel whose upkeep is the affair of the
taxpayers. The N.S.W. Government aban-
doned any claim it might have had against
the Alexa and its valuable cargo of copra,
but granted permission to the officers and
crew to sue on their own account. The case
was heard before Justice Sly, who found
that valuable services had been rendered by
plaintiffs; that, in fact, they had rescued
the Alexa. But he dismissed the case on
two points: (1) That the regulations under
the Navigation Act require the crew of the
pilot steamer to render aid to vessels in
distress; (2) That no King’s ship can sue
for salvage without the consent of the
Briitish Admiralty. Had the case (the
first of its kind in Australia) gone the other
way, and the crew of the Captain Cook
established the right to claim salvage in re-
spect of vessels assisted, the rush for billets
in the pilot service (already big) would
have become a regular stampede.

Time is a strange old creature and can wait
for his revenge. He has all Space and Eter-
nity before him. A few centuries, or even a
few eras, don’t matter. When, not very
long ago, Persia sent an embassy to Greece,
after more than 2000 years’ suspension of
diplomatic i-elations, the last Persian Minis-
ter having been thrown down a well by the
Greeks away back in the tangled wilderness
of 8.c., Time was hurrying. _ But the other
day he got on a devil of a sprint. In 1870 a
dispirited and ill-conducted French army
crossed into German territory and fought the
first skirmish of Napoleon lll.’s war at
Saarbruck. Then the tide of battle turned,
and France never looked up again. Saar-
bruck was where the Prince Imperial, who
was afterwards killed by an unimportant
nigger in Africa, received his “baptism of
fire.” Now, after waiting 44 years, a much
greater French army, full of fight, is pouring
over the same frontier, and the battle which
was interrupted in 1870 is going to be
finished. One way or another the arrears
are to be cleaned up.
The late Gregor McGregor took about the
biggest jump on record on entering Parlia-
ment, going into South Australia’s Upper
House straight from pick-and-shovel work,
However, before he came to Australia, aged
30, he had been prominent in Labor move-
ments in Glasgow dockyards, and he waited
17 years before becoming M.L.C. He filled,
meanwhile, most of the higher posts in the
State’s Labor party. In 1901 S.A. sent
most of its best men of either side to the
first Federal Parliament, and McGregor
became Senator almost as a matter of course.
He was only 66 when the end came.
There seems to be —as Hughes said last
week —a “dreadful fatality” attending the
South Aus. batch of Federal politicians.
“Stadium”: Germany, to me, seems to be
in the position of a fight-thirsty pugilist
who has gone down to the stoush depQt to
have a cut at an old opponent and struck a
whirlwind of opposition on the way to the
ring, where the old opponent is smilingly
awaiting him, reinforced by two tremen-
dously powerful friends, one of whom in-
tends to be always behind him. Meanwhile,
one of the confident lad’s supposed friends
is scuffling ingloriously in a corner with the
hostile small boy he tried to bully,
and the other is taking a front seat
and preparing to watch the contest
with an impartial eye. The only ques-
tion seems to be: How far will it go?
As there is no referee to score the points, it
is bound to be a knock-out. And the unfor-
tunate person who is just trying to get to
the ropes has only one notable victory to his
credit! A fight promoter who staged such a
contest would deserve all the hard things
that could be said about him. But then the
fight-hungry one has been his own promoter.
The permanent and reproductive railway
that the Australian always builds out of
loan money is the first asset to be torn up
by the roots when war really arrives.
Sometimes the enemy (who doesn’t own
it or owe for it) does the job in a care-free
manner, and sometimes the groaning bor-
rower has to wreck his own security to
save worse trouble. But neither of the
belligerents can utterly destroy and efface
the bill. A skilled and earnest gang of
wreckers, working at high pressure, can
make the most permanent and reproduc-
tive railway look just like a heap of old iron
in a few hours. But, providing the borrower
survives, it remains on Cohen’s books as a
beautiful, complete railway in good working
order. The really permanent, eternal and
imperishable railway hasn’t yet been in-
vented. Nothing is permanent and im-
perishable but death.

BRANAGAN'S BACK.
WILLIAM : “ Branagan is half-back.”
AUGUSTA: “ You're right—he is rather
decollet e.”
“Hot Room”: One of my pet vices is
Turkish bathing. Once a week I rest my
.jaded mind and body by retiring to a place
of heat and silence and getting myself par-
tially cooked. It isn’t so much the cooking
that refreshes me as the silence and nudity.
The washing and kneading are secondary
considerations, and I believe I could
do without them altogether. However, when
I arrive at the baths on Saturday afternoon
I am too tired to say so to the manager, and
the odds are he wouldn’t understand me if I
did. So I submit to the usual washings and
take my money’s worth in peace on the slab.
But when I arrived last Saturday the
usually peaceful baths were filled with hot
unclothed men of various shapes who were
shouting alleged war news at one another.
They had collected a mass of scare intelli-
gence and were hurling it backwards and
forwards like a caye-full of barbarians. All
they wanted to complete their make-up
was a bundle of stone axes and a bearskin
or two. Before I could draw back, they
had demanded my opinion on the situation,
and straightway I found myself engaged by
a total stranger of globular shape who wore
a small towel round Iris shoulders and a
gleam of frenzy in his eye. When I had
fought myself clear of him I was tackled
by a tali person like an armored cruiser
gone to ruin. He had no intellectual guns
worth mentioning, but his mind was full
of poisonous gas, and he kept at me till I
rose and steamed at top speed for my
clothes. I finally escaped from the place
with my mind shot to rags. When the war
is over I will resume the Turkish bath
habit. There is nothing in it just now,

“Fiddlestick”: This is the tale of a
patriotic boardinghouse proprietress, and a
string band. Madame Hash is in the habit
of hiring an orchestra of sorts and giving
her guests a “musical dinner” once a week.
The night on which the news came that J.
Bull was at war, the band was just turning
up preparatory to murdering the overture,
and the boarders were on the point of
attacking the soup, when the lady_ rushed
into the dining-room in great excitement.
“Stop!” she commanded; and the soup-
eaters and the fiddlers alike ceased their
noises. Approaching the leader of _ the
orchestra the true-blue patriot asked in a
voice trembling with emotion: “Are there
any Germans among you?” “Nein!” came
the instant reply. “Ye vos all, eferyone,
Oustralien* 1”

Some military .terms explained : —-
A convention is a ■meeting' to arrange rules of war
for your enemy to obserae during peace.
A censor is an officer who gives the newspapers a
chance to pretend that they know more than they
tell.
An enemy is one who can’t keep up the pretence
of being your bosom friend any longer.
A peace society is a society which is at peace
•during war.
An ambassador is a gentleman employed at a large
salary to write history in advance.
Patriotism is a quality
in man nearest akin
to virtue in woman;
and the virtuous
woman takes her vir-
tue for granted.
An armistice is an
opportunity given to
war correspondents to
renew their imagina-
tions.
War news is the hot
poker with which the
papers warm the pot
of public enthusiasm.
AVhen it has done its
job it is withdrawn.
Alliances are things
you quarrel about
when no other pre-
texts are available.
An army is the most
you can get for your
money.
Tactics are the series
of accidents which hap-
pen to you when you get into a row. Strategy is
the list you draw up for your enemy beforehand.
Armageddon is the general term applied to the
next great war.
“0.K.”: It should be dead-easy for the
Pankhurst militants to (get Woman Suffrage
granted by the next British Parliament. All
they have to do is to enlist as field-hospital
nurses, organise a system of relief-work in
Britain, and otherwise make themselves con-
spicuously useful. After thus rising to the
occasion they can march to the House of
Commons, and the vote will be brought to
the heroines on a silver salver. Militancy
has failed hitherto, because it wasn’t admir-
able. The time was Not Yet Ripe. But the
blood-red sun has ripened it. . “Votes for
Women,” placarded in every military hospi-
tal, and pinned to the heaving breast of
every nursemaid when Tommy and Jack
come back with woioden legs, will convert
the Army and Navy to the rebel cause; and
what the Army and Navy wants it has only
to ask for, and (for a time, at least) it will
get.
A practical joker, whose methods belong
to the pre-booby Trap, or Stone Age period
of humor, is operating just now at Carlton
(Melb.). He sent by telephone to one
house last, week a doctor, a couple ot par-
sons, two undertakers, and finally a nunibei
of policemen, to remove the alleged victim
of an accident to the morgue. . The last
time this class of joke was played in London
the victim sent the wag, by way of a return
jest, a retired pugilist with instructions to
take it out of the humor-
ist’s hide. In the re-
sulting court proceedings
the magistrate said that
the one joke seemed to
him as justifiable as the
other.
AH INSULT.
SALVATIONAIST (singing): “Now , the Lord is passing by—passing by — passing by ”
DRUNK (threatening): “Are you alludin' ter me , young feller?”
Some remarkable testimony is adduced
against compulsory training in “The Mili-
tary Menace in Australia,” a tract in sup-
port of the Australian Freedom League and
its noble propaganda : —•
The ideals of manhood and morality set before
armed Europe may be summed-up in the words of
Kaiser William to his conscripts: “I may call upon
you to shoot down or bayonet your own relatives—-
father and mother, sisters and brothers. My orders
in that respect must be executed cheerfully and with-
out grumbling.” Hear him again: “The Gospels must
he introduced with a fist of iron.” Again: “The
army in China must take r.o prisoners, but kill all.”
Wherefore, asks the quaint Freedom League:
“What is the Australian citizen’s duty—to
foment and hasten strife by training our
young in the principles of war?” Nay, nay
indeed! Rather let us offer no resistance to
Bill Hohenzollern when his “gospel” arrives
in these parts. After putting sister and
wife in the forefront of the slaughter, mother
with them, and grandmamma in between,
nothing will remain for ourselves, of course,
but to tear hastily for the tall timber, with
Freedom still our watchword and peace
reigning over all!
* * * *
“Hermes”: I suspect that this European
turmoil will be decided by the plain Jenny
Wren type of officer who runs the commis-
sariat. Any fool with enough cash and
men can raise an army 1,200,000 strong, as
Kaiser W. has done. But it requires a
genius to collect food and general supplies,
and have the lot always where it is wanted.
The French, Belgian and British forces are
acting chiefly on the defensive, so their food,
problem, although big enough, is not so big'
as that of the Germans, who are the attack-
ing party. Imagine about twice the popu-
lation of Sydney shifting its hungry mouth
every day, and you get some idea of this
German horde and what the feeding of it
means. The difficulties of transport will in-
crease as the army advances, and if there
should be a big battle and an unutterable
smash it will be about impossible to feed
such a mass of men on a retreat. It looks
as though the modern system of hurling all
the able-bodied of a nation at the throat of
another, and leaving the feeding of them to
the old, the feeble and military unfit, will
bi’eak down under its own weight.
Australia does not realise what an unusual
place it is until it sees the astonishment and
delight of a trained observer such as any of
the big Science Congress men. According to
their various bent, they go into ecstasies
over their first experience of a blackfellow,
or a gold mine, or a kookaburra or iguana,
or an acacia-wattle in bloom, or even over
the sun persistently in the north. South
Australia showed them all these things, bar
the gold-mine; also it took them to see its
Hallett’s Cove rock grooved by (alleged!
glaciers, and led them into a copper-mine and
the big winery at Seppeltsfield, and got up a
corroboree, and remarked upon its ideally
laid-out city. Only when they congratu-
lated it on its perfect midwinter climate, it
smiled sadly, and tried to look as if cloudless
skies were not steadily assailing its most
important and vulnerable spot, the wheat-
field, where a worse disaster is threatened
than any the State has known for years and
years.
TERRIBLE THOUGHT.
SCHOOL SPINSTER (to Art spinster): “If the
enemy [?]ome they might seize us girls to be
their Hives.”
The war discovered the existence of a.
woman with an undue amount of good luck.
When the dreadful news arrived that Britain
was involved she fled, in a state of acute
financial panic, to the post office, and wntn-
drew the' whole of her savings, viz., *5/,*
Of this sum £3O was in Commonwealth
notes. She lost the notes on the way home,
and notified the police. The latter adver-
tised iind next day a “Mr. Walker, a
laborer,” called and handed over the
“flimsies,” receiving the lady’s thanks in
return. When you remember the uninteln-
gence of Melbourne’s police and add to it
the odds against the notes having been
found by a citizen sufficiently honest not to
steal them, you arrive at the vast sum ot
this foolish female’s good fortune.
BOG IN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A Belgian named Boggarts dashed from his o\ Vn
ranks, killed four Germans, and regained his coiu-
rades without a scratch. He made these salli es
several times.- — War cable.
The Uhlans do not want to fight, their hearts are f ar
away;
They do not hate the Belgians, and they do not want
to slay ;
But, since the war-drunk Caesar drives them on their
bloody track,
We must whack them very swiftly; we must break
and drive them back.
We must thrash them till the Kaiser has his thirst
for fame a-slako,
And our German brother we must wallop for that
brother’s sake;
We must kill a-many Germans, that the German V ve
may win—-
So, bog in, Boggarts ! Bog in.
A mighty people dragged to death behind a Kaiser’s
car;
The Rhine grapes rot because the press treads out
the grapes of war ;
Down by Treves, and up at Namur and from Liege
east to Cologne,
We must make the reaping swiftly of the death the
Kaiser’s sown ;
With some quick, decisive battles, that their hearts
may fail them soon,
And that peace come ere the wounded faint beneath
a wintry moon;
’Tis sacrifice of guiltless blood to purge the war-
lord’s sin!
So bog in, Boggarts! Bog in!
Give our brothers not a minute’s rest to steel their
hearts anew.
So that next harvest may be peace, let battle’s ghastlv
dew
Splash the fields of corn and poppies ; let the furrows
be a grave
For the few who are the luckless, that the others W e
may save;
Strike hard and strike them quickly; deal swift
penance for their sin !
Bog in, Boggarts i Bog in!

TO STRENGTHEN WEAK LUNGS AND
IMPROVE APPETITE AND DIGESTION.
Modern scientific treatment of lung affections
aims first to improve appetite, digestion -and
nutrition, and secondly to heal the inflamed or
diseased mucous membrane of the lungs and
air passages.
The ideal prepara'ion for accomplishing
these two objects is Angier’s Emulsion. This
remedy combines the soothing, healing pro-
perties of a specia’ly purified petroleum with
the tonic properties of the liypophosphites of
lime and soda. By its soothing an 1 disinfectant
action in the stomach and intestines it corrects
digestive irregularities and greatly improves
assimi'ation and nutrition, while at the same
time it exerts a most invigorating tonic in-
fluence upon the general health. Briefly stated,
Angier’s Emulsion is soothing and healing to
throat, lungs, stomach and intestines, an aid
to appetite and digestion, and a vitalizing
tonic and restorative. For twenty-one years
it has been prescribed by the medical profession
and used in the hospitals, and is now universally
recognised as a standard approved remedy for
lung troubles, digestive and bowel disorders and
wasting diseases. The combined healing and
strengthening properties of the emulsion
I make it invaluable for healing the lungs and
building up health and strength after pneu-
monia, pleurisy, influenza or any illness
affecting the lungs ; also after measles, fevers
or any protracted illness. Even for the person
of average good health, Angier’s Emulsion is
of value, because it keeps the digestive organs
in a normal healthy condition to perform their
functions naturally, thus making the use of pills
unnecessary. Of all chemists at 1/3, 2/9 and 4/6.

The story of one patriot and another: —
l, George Gordon, Gas Manager, Port Fairy, Vic-
toria, solemnly and sincerely declare the contents of
tin's letter to be true. —Geo. Gordon. Sworn before
me, J. C. Holden, J.P., Port Fairy, Aug. 10., 1914.
(1) I am a member of the Port Fairy Rifle Club,
and at a special meeting of the club on August, 6 1,
with six others, volunteered to serve my country
during the war.
(2) On Saturday, August 8, my landlord informed
my wife and;myself that he had heard 1 had volun-
teered, and that the allowance to my wife was only
3s. per day. He said she could not -keep herself
and family and pay his rent on this amount, and in
the event of the rent not being paid it would be his
duty to put her in the street. He said people would
condemn him for doing this, and, .to make himself
right, I must take written notice to quit in 30 days.
The notice to take effect immediately the rent
became in arrear. 1-Ie said I should have hung back
until I was forced to go.
(3) As I expect to be called any day, and as there
is no other house available here in any way suitable,
1 have had to make arrangements for the sale of
my furniture and the transport of my family- to
Melbourne immediately on receiving orders to report
myself.
(4) My said landlord is a Justice of the Peace.
(5) My rent has never been in arrear since" I
became the said landlord’s tenant.
(6) I am one of the-picked spots of the club.
(7) The said landlord. is a‘ man of substance and
a considerable property, owner.
(8) l have had the extreme pleasure of kicking
him off my premises; and 1 have reported the facts
of the case to the Hon. the Minister for Defence and
the Hon. the State Premier.
Dear Bulletin,— The war ended almost
as soon as it began, and Britain is obli-
terated, and its coat of arms is defaced, and
its sun has gone down with ignominy and
contempt into the ocean wave. Never again
will it look up. This was how it all hap-
pened. Two Hebrews, who used to give me
reasonable credit, became afraid that I would
lose my job through the downfall of our
civilisation or some other beastly old animal.
They mobilised themselves —nowadays every-
body is mobilised save the people of the
Falkland Islands—-and advanced on me in
close order. Their artillery, in the shape
of a writ, was pushed in front. Their light
cavalry, consisting of a time-payment furni-
ture agreement, on which six instalments
were overdue, covered the country and cut
off supplies. As Tennyson or Macaulay or
Shelley put it —I forget which of them put
it, and I recite from memory:—
Their light-armed ships blockade the ports,
Their archers hold the mountain forts,
Their horsemen tread the harvest down.
The river, black with many a mast,
On twelve proud bridges have they passed,
And pitched their mighty camp at last
Before Gain’s imperial town.
The quotation may be wrong in places, but
in the hurry and scuffle of war no one can
be wliollv accurate. I faced the enemy in

didn’t arrive in time. In other words, a
fellow named Smith who promised to cojn-
mit perjury on my account was late through

that my fortress was taken with ss. costs.
It seems to me, an ill-omened beginning of
the great struggle, and I fear the worst. I
wouldn’t be astonished if I heard to-morrow
that London had been captured.—Yours, etc.,

It is suggested that murderers should have the option of submitting themselves to some “simple
surgical experiment” as an alternative to hanging.— Social science note.

cerebellum lan[?]? ”
PRISONER (on thinking it over): “ No, thanks; ust the plain hanging."
“Moana”: A year or two ago Bertie
Wright, as Timothy Gibbs, was creating a
roar of laughter nightly in “Our Miss Gibbs”
by holding a lost umbrella up to the receiver
of a telephone and asking the lady at the
other end of the wire if it was hers. A few
years earlier, when the telephone was new,
a coipic paper pub-
lished a drawing-
depicting a dude
dressed in a suit of
pyjamas speaking into
a telephone in the
early morning and
saying: “Excuse me
for speaking to you in
this rig.” Both of
those alleged jokes
have come true re-
cently, it now being
possible to see by wire.
The device is fitted
into a box that can
be attached to any
telephone, and with it
the persons using the
instrument can see
each other while they
are speaking. It can
be used in conjunc-
tion with wireless,
and so scientists are
predicting that shortly
Australasians at home
will be able to appre-
ciate Uncle Cohen’s
bright smile when he,
at Loandon, collects
his dividends on their
pawned assets. Now,
will somebody please
invent a machine that
will enable the bor-
row and bust crowd
to look upon the face
of Posterity and feel ashamed of themselves.

One awkward outcome of the war,, fiom
the point of view of certain folks, is the
automatic disappearance of the rights at
civil law of “alien enemies.” Thus when
Carl Tauber, a German subject, of long
Australian standing, recently asked Vic.
Insolvency Judge Moule for a certificate of
discharge from his debts, and argued that
the Crown’s right to confiscate an alien’s
property extended only to corporal goods
and not to debts, his Honor replied that the
Crown didn’t want Tauber’s debts at all,
whether he was an enemy or not. The posi-
tion was that at present he couldn’t recover
debts, and the Court wasn’t going to wipe
out his debts either. The _ Judge’s point
was that so far as the civil law went
Tauber simply didn’t exist. Legally he was
a nameless corpse.
“Sawmill Charlie”: If the Croatians at
home are anything like the Croatians in
Maoriland, Francis Joseph isn’t likely to get
much solid help from them. They’re Slavs,
nearly all these so-called Austrian gum-
diggers, and would make poor soldiers on
the side of any piratical old Emperor in a
campaign against others of the same blood.
In fact, I’m inclined to think they’d make
mighty poor fighting stuff in any scrap last-
ing over five minutes in a tight place. It is
true they dig sometimes as if pursued by 17
devils. They can live on the smell of next
week’s dinner, and are not addicted to con-
siderations of personal comfort. But, physi-
cally and mentally, they are poor stuff. About
most of them there’s some indefinable quality
of pathos; they appear to bear the centuries-
old brand of an iron heel. They work, as a
rule, with the resigned, plodding persistency
one notices among Chinamen. They live in
shacks and hovels. They are given to wild
bursts of Booze, to running amok and kindred
frenzies. But if one could turn loose an army
in the frame of mind I once saw an Austrian
digger occupy at Dargaville, they’d clean up
all Europe. This wild cat, full of cheap
spirit, wrecked two pubs and three shops,
shot a couple of citizens and knifed four or
five others. It was only when the firebell
rang and the whole population fell, on the
alien en masse that he hoisted the white
flag. Then he relapsed into a wooden silence,
which had not been broken 12 months later
when I heard of him in a lunatic asylum.
The war supplies a whole essay on the
necessity for providing every ship, which is
something better than a ferry-boat, with
wireless telegraphy. The economical Ger-
mans send many of their big vessels to sea
without wireless. One after another of
these has plodded, honestly and full of good
faith, into a hostile port, because the cap-
tain didn’t know that strife had commenced.
Australia has arrested some and _ hopes to
get more. Probably a few British and
French ships have struck the same sort of
disaster. The maddest man on the seas
just now is the skipper who takes a ship
worth £lOO,OOO up to the old, familiar wharf,
and finds himself and his vessel arrested by
an official who earns only £3 a week. A
mere trifle spent on a wireless installation
would have enabled him to turn back and
sprint for home, or else flee for neutral
waters. Last Saturday all the lager beer
on earth wouldn’t have cooled the feelings
of the captain of the Lothringen, because
he steamed into Melbourne harbor, and Mel-
bourne spread out its arms and gathered him
in. He was almost wild enough to speak
disrespectfully of the Yarra.
* * * *
“Non-Com.”: That Kaiser Bill never ex-
pected Russia to call his bluff is made evi-
dent by his lack of preparation for the
rush on France. For years it has been
known that the German plan of campaign
was to demoralise France with a sudden
dash on Paris, and then throw a million men
back across to meet the Bear as he came
in over the frontier in his slow, deliberate
way. When the Morocco affair threatened
to end in war it leaked out that the German
preparations for the dash were hideously
complete. German agents were in all the
frontier .towns to seize the available auto-
mobiles, to cut telegraphs and to blow up
railway bridges and viaducts. On this
occasion, it seems, none of these prepara-
tions were made; when the Germans
rushed into Belgium there was no commis-
sariat even, and the unfortunate troops were
fed on lead and steel instead of meat and
bread. The Prussians at the rear were so
busy rushing men to the front that- those
who got there first were two days without
food, except what they could scratch up
for themselves. But they were mostly
Bavarian and Wurtemburg soldiers —
people, in the eyes of the swanking Prussians,
fit only to be food for cannon. The whole
conduct of the dash suggests that William
was the Unready. Meantime an army corps
has been wiped out and a week of most
valuable time lost; and no doubt across the
track to Paris are, by this time, whole series
of trenches waiting for the defending force
to snugly step into.
MAKING THE BEST OF IT.
Australia has offered a contingent for service at
the front. — News item.

“Suppressed” : Allow me to raise my voice
—anonymously, of course. This tremen-
dous fight for freedom has inspired me to
raise the standard of revolt and (without
mentioning my own name) to denounce the
so-called sanctity of the home. I have a
home —at least my wife has. lam the
honorary parcels express and week-end
gardener. lam also the doer-of-odd-jobs
and the night watchman. I pay an indem-
nity of two-thirds of my weekly salary, in
consideration of which she is supposed to
refrain from invading my peace of mind and
bombarding me with questions. Needless
to say she doesn’t respect her solemn treaty
obligations any more than a certain Power,
now very much on the job. I am in a con-
tinual state of war, but no Power or group
of Powers will come to my assistance. It
seems horribly unjust, so I am putting in
my claim while there is assistance avail-
able. lam not a nation or a. people —but
I am one people, and I consider that I
have a small claim for protection. Any
benevolent Power with time to spare will
be supplied with my name and address on
production of a reference from an ordained
clergyman or other responsible person.

You’d never think we were at war ;
All round the church is still;
Doves coo, and o’er the vestry door
A sparrow whets his bill.

And madly ring the bells.

And dash stones in the goldfish pool
And make some vulgar sound.

HOW I RUBBED AWAY A STONE OF
FAT FROM MY HIPS AND ABDOMEN
IN TWO WEEKS’ TIME.
For years I tried every possible means to
bide the excessive fat on my hips and
abdomen, it seemed as if it had accumulated
on just the two places that it would be most
noticeable. Everything that I tried failed to
make me any thinner. But thanks to a lady
friend who had studied herboristerie, I
learned the secret of a harmless plan which
enabled me to rub away with ease a stone
of useless fat in only two weeks.
The plan is so simple and some of my
friends seem so glad to know of it that I
think there may be sister readers of the
Sydney Bulletin who have perhaps been
longing for this very advice. First, get
from any good chemist 1 dram of quassia
chips and 3 ounces of cirola bark extract.
Take them home and, after putting the
quassia chips in a pan, pour over it a tea-
cupful of boiling water. When this has
stood for about a minute, strain through a
cloth and add the cirola bark extract. Then
pour the mixture into a bottle and apply
it every night and morning with’ your hands
for about ten minutes, using a circular
movement. Each time you can almost see
some of the fat melt away. At first I
thought it must be a dream, but. when I
measured there was no longer any doubt. I
soon grew too slender for my clothes and had
to have them taken in, but it was a pleasure
to do it. and I shall feel eternally grateful
to Ihe lady who showed me how easy it was
to regain my youthful figure. —E. E. A. "

Senator and Father of S.A. Far.
It is just possible that the poor showing
which the German host has made in Bel-
gium is owing to it being 10 months too
previous. Next June will see the 100th
anniversary of the victory—largely a Ger-
man victory—at Waterloo. Now if it hap-
pens that Bluchers ghost arranged to rise
from the grave on the day of the Waterloo
centenary (and no one knows what arrange-
ments a ghost may make) it is the Kaiser’s
previousness which has deprived his country
of the services of a magnificent old spectre.
Even the dry bones of “Marshal Forwards”
might be an inspiriting asset these times.
But if Germany has been too soon in one
sense it has been too late in another. The
war has been postponed until the German
population has outgrown the local food
supply. It depends to some extent, though
not to anything like the same extent, as
Britain, on imported victuals. Austria also
has just got over the line at which there is
surplus food for export. With land sup-
plies cut off by the anger of Russia, and
sea supplies stopped by the French and
British fleets, Germany may, for the first
time in history, have to fight with nothing
save old Rhine wine in its stomach.
UNDOUBTED LOYALTY TO THE
BRITISH FLAG.
THE HOSTESS: “How did your friend Oscar
express himself on the war with his
country?”
THE GUEST: “Very displeased , I assure you.
He absolutely refused to drink any more
German beer.”
The law is wholly unable to see a good
thing when the good thing comes along. Last
week a German resident of Sydney, who
had been insolvent for no less than 21 years,
but had now paid his creditors in full, asked
the Bankruptcy Court for a discharge. This
being a time when Germany is at war with
us the Court should have given three cheers,
because one of the hostile race had gone
broke. Then it should have, given three
more cheers because he had paid up, and no
British citizen had lost by him. Three more
cheers might not have been out of place in
granting the discharge, so that the bankrupt
might go away instead of staying here to
inspect the fortifications or otherwise serve
Kaiser William. And if an odd cheer had
been thrown in by way of discount it
wouldn’t have been amiss. That would have
made 10 cheers altogether. Instead of which
applause the case of Emil Julius Silberberg
was adjourned till next month on the ground
that he was some sort of a public enemy.
Now, how much adjournment will make any
difference to his position as a public enemy?
“Budda”: Died recently, on the rough
track between Groggin and Corryong (Vic.),
John Riley, said in those parts to be the
original of Paterson’s “Man from Snowy
River.” For 30 years Riley had charge of
Groggin, a cattle station at the foot of
Kosciusko, 50 miles, from Corryong. It is
accessible only by bridle or pack tracks. The
main track keeps to the Victorian side all
the way, and in crossing the precipitous Indi
Gorge much rough country is met with.
Anyone unacquainted with the Upper
Murray could scarcely conceive the difficul-
ties which beset the bushmen who, under
the Kosciusko guide, Finlayson, undertook to
carry a dying mate through gorge and ravine
to medical attention. The first obstruction
was the Hermit Hill (2000 ft.)., five miles
from Groggin. Snow was falling and the
sides of the precipice became so slippery and
the cold so intense that the bearers had to
abandon the stretcher. A mountain pony
was introduced, and Riley placed' in the
saddle. Butler, the lightest of the party,
mounted behind and supported the dying
man till Surveyor’s Creek Junction was
reached. Death met them there. The body
was, however, conveyed per stretcher, and
buggy to Corryong, where it was buried.
Riley was an open-hearted busliman, a
superb horseman, and a fearless stockhand
with the homing instinct of a dingo.
Dead recently, aged about 90, WiHiam
Moore, Tasmanian Parliamentarian, wno
sat for Wellington 1871-77. At the close ot
that term he went to the Upper
representative of Russell. He held se\e <
Ministerial offices, and in 1889 was elected
President of the Legislative Council; also,
in 1891, he attended the Sydney federation
Convention as one of the delegates of App e
speck. . e ,
“Kola”: Among the many notices of the
late O. W. Palmer, of Terang, I have not
seen any reference to an ill-starred expen-
ment made by him in the ’Bo’s. Palmer had
a dairy farm at Tooram (Vic.), a few miles
east of Warrnambool. Having some diffi-
culty in securing hands, he conceived the
brilliant idea of importing colored labor.
So he brought out a shipment of Hindoos
and set them at the cows. But the Ram
Chunders didn’t take kindly to the work,
and Palmer had great trouble with them.
They were dirty, also; but that was a sec-
ondary consideration. They started light-
ing, and one turbaned shirt-tail nearly slew
another. The climax came when they joined
forces and threatened to smash up Palmer
arid defile liis bones. The Law then stepped
in. and Gunga and his compatriots were
fired home to Delhi’s coral strand, where the
waters go down at Lahore.
Old Alfred Allen, who. 25 years ago, was
the laurel-crowned harpist _of Bulletin
political cartoons, is very seriously ill. Just
before he was elected for Paddington (1887)
lie published a book of poems, “Australian
Verse Drift”; hence the laurel and the harp.
In his early days he was known as the
Quaker noet; in the House he was a faint
echo of Henry Parkes. He was the useful
author of the Early Closing Bill and the
kindly founder of the Sydney Night Refuge
and Soup Kitchen in Kent-street. The
building in which he established this charity
was the first home. in Sydney of James
Dowling, Chief Justice, who occupied it in
1828. It still stands. Mr. Allen’s father
was a soap-maker, who set himself up in
that business at Blackwattle Swamp three-
quarters of a century ago. In those days,
before tinned meat and freezing chambers
were invented, soap-making included sheep
and cattle-boiling, the surplus stock (when
there was any) being thus got rid of for
their tallow.
“10-2-4”: Let me make amends. About a
month ago I cited young Quinlan, who
killed a woman in a Sydney hotel under
peculiar circumstances, as an instance of
a dangerous psychopath. I went on the
reports of his trial, which made the crime
appear motiveless to the point of insanity.
A friend of the youngster’s blameless and
altogether estimable family assures me that
the reports fail to do justice to the actual
situation. It appears that he had particular
need of money, that he went to his victim’s
room to get it, and that he attacked her in
a sudden panic of-being discovered. If this
is so it puts him in a much less dangerous
class than the Sadistic lunatic. The mur-
derer-for-gain may be cured of his tendency
by a steady and decently requited job, where-
as the other sort of offender remains a public
peril till he dies.
A DANGEROUS BREATH.
INEBRIATED HUBBY: “Splendid (hie) victory,
m' dear. Allies (hie) surprish the

WIFE: “Well, it's a good job you were not
there. T he enemy would have smelt you

Now that Britain is involved in a big war
one wonders how Joshua Ratcliff, the Mel-
bourne “conscientious objector” to compul-
sory training, feels on the subject. After
selling all that he had—at a sacrifice, no
doubt —and wiping the dust of “military-
ridden” Australia off his shoes, Joshua de-
parted with his lads for Europe—and peace !
A line from Joshua, explaining how he likes
peace, would be very interesting.
Died at Glen Innes last week, aged 87,
Sophie, widow of William Gunsell Burgis.
She was a Hawkesbury native, a daughter
of Thomas Dargin, a free man, and one of
546 Hawkesbury settlers who signed an ad-
dress of welcome to Governor Bligh in 1807.
Bligh was good to the Hawkesbury, and
put the curb on the military “trader” who
fleeced the settlers of his produce, giving
him rum in return. Even rum has its
limitations.
A. B. MONCRIEFF, Railway Com-
missioner of S.A.
Dead at Newcastle last Thursday Henry
J. Brown, the oldest solicitor on the N. 8.
Wales roll, admitted 1858. The patriarch
of the profession is now Henry Deane, of
Springwood, admitted in 1809. lie belonged
to the old-time firm of Deane and Deane,
founded by William Deane in the ’so’s.
One of the most indignant ladies in Europe
these times is the Grand Duchess of Luxem-
burg. She protested personally against the
entrance of German troops into her little
yard, whereupon an oflicah drew his tireiron
and said “Voman, go avay!” or words to
that effect. So she vent avay, threatening
to write to the Kaiser about it.
Maoriland’s Legislative Council, which is
busy reforming itself into an elective instead
of a nominee* body, has seven life members
left in its voting strength of 39. These are
W. D. 11. Baillie (appointed 1861), 11. J.
Miller (1865), George McLean (1881), E.
C. J. Stevens (1882), C. C. Bowen (1891),
C. «T. Johnston (1891), J. D. Ormond
(1S91). Only one of them, “Charlie”
Johnston, is a native, lie was born at Wel-
lington 69 years ago.
Mrs. Katherine Dendy, widow of Henry
Dendy, of Brighton and Walhalla (Vic.),
died in Sydney a few days ago. Henry
Dendy was an old Port Phillip colonist who
took advantage of a land regulation of 1841
whereby a person paying £5120 into the
Treasury might fix upon any portion of
unreserved territory and require the authori-
ties to survey for him eight square miles.
On June 8, 1841, Governor Gipps notified
that eight of these special surveys had been
applied for. One of the eight applicants
was Henry Dendy, who took his kingdom on
Port Phillip Bay, including the whole of
what is now Brighton. Besides getting the
land at £1 per acre, Dendy and the others
had the right to nominate “one of the labor-
ing class” for a free passage to the colony
for every £2O paid.
“Chasuble”: Monsignor Cerretti, the Apos-
tolic Delegate who is to be located in Sydney,
was to be consecrated at St. Peter’s, Borne,
on July 19, the officiating prelate being Car-
dinal Del Val, Secretary of State. To be
sure, this would be in the chapel space at
one side of the capacious floor, yet it is a
mighty honor. Putting this and that to-
gether, I don’t think the Australian arch-
bishops and bishops relish Cerretti. Cer-
tainly I do not find any of them gushing
about him. Nor does the. religious press
gush, and it takes its cue from the leaders.
Meanwhile, sundry Catholic Australians have
been interviewing Cerretti in Borne. But
not a syllable can be extracted from him as
to what he is going to do, or what are his
powers. At the same time, he is most loqua-
cious. He is only about 40. and therefore
younger than almost any other magnate of
the Church here. Thus we await the bland
Sphinx. On appearance, he might be a
nephew of Archbishop Carr.
The London papers lately got a story
from the Pie Commissioner’s office about: a
remarkable discovery. In November, 1849,
Margaret Cameron wrote from Fort YV il-
liam, in Scotland, telling brother Donald
about a legacy. The yarn runs that Donald
dropped* the letter on the road between
Castlemaine and Taradale (Vic.), and for
34 years it lay there, till Edward Taylor, of
Taradale, found it. Edward kept the letter
which had been lying on the road for 31
years, and 31 years later, when somebody
advertised in Melbourne for the missing heir,
Taylor rooted out the ancient document and
sent it on spec, to rhe advertiser. That
more or less fixed i Km, aid. who was
earthed in Queensland aged 90. Tiie
Bulletin hates to disbelieve a word of it;
still it can’t help remembering that the name
of the man who is alleged to have left the
money unclaimed for 65 years was Cameron,
and Donald Cameron at that. But perhaps
that’s really the remarkable discovery.

The WILDCAT
COLUMN
The conference between the Federal Gov-
ernment and State Premiers# adopted the
proposals made here last week for enabling
vhe gold resources of the country to do the
utmost of which they mre capable in the
present world crisis. The idea was to turn
some of the credit of the country into cash
when cash may be badly needed. The
method suggested for carrying out that idea
was that the Commonwealth should issue
notes against deposits of gold with the
Federal Treasury—a £J note against ss. or
Us. Sd. worth of metal. The scheme actually
adopted was to authorise the issue of 20s.
worth of paper against ss. worth of gold in
the case of State Governments, and 6s. Bd. of
gold in the case of private banks. A State
Treasury with £500,000 of gold can there-
fore command £2,000,000 of legal tender, and
in the same circumstances a bank can com-
mand £1,500,000 worth. Besides the gold.
I he State or the bank will deposit its promise
to pay; in short, the Commonwealth will
allow it an overdraft at the rate of 4 p.c.
This is very good business for the Common-
wealth, which will thus be making 4 p.c. out
of its own credit —a very handy source of
revenue, at a time when revenue is badly
wanted on account of the shrinkage in cus-
toms receipts. It is equally good business
for the States and the banks, which will get
money at 4 p.c. at a time when money is
very hard to get no matter what inducement
is offered. And it is also good business for
the individual citizens, who are thus enabled
to draw against their own resources at a time
when, without some such scheme, their
resources would be of little value to them,
and might be seriously jeopardised for want
of a trifle to carry on with. If any legisla-
tion is needed to give effect to the scheme,
there is no doubt that it will be promptly
passed.
The whole plan, of course, depends upon
the fact that Commonwealth notes are legal
tender. To issue them without any backing
of gold at all would be dangerous, seeing that
the Commonwealth undertakes to pay them
in gold ; but a reserve running from 25 p.c.
upwards is ample for the purpose. The other
75 p.c. is as good as gold. Of that there
can be no shadow of doubt whatever. It
will be absolutely impossible for the Com-
monwealth to issue on the terms above-
mentioned more notes than it can pay. If
every 7 ounce of gold in Australia were dumped
into the Commonwealth Treasury and paper-
currency of four times the gold value were
issued against it, the issue would still be
well protected. The plain fact of the matter
is that the Commonwealth is mortgaging all
the taxable wealth of the country, and that
wealth isn’t a mere four times more than
the gold reserves of the country—it is
upwards of 20 times more. Behind every
note that is issued stands Australia, and all
its gold mines and its coal and silver and
copper mines, and its sheep and its cattle,
and its wool and its wheat, and its timber,
and its grazing lands, and its farming lands
and its orchards, and its shipping and
its stocks of merchandise, and the labor and
the earning capacity of all its people. If
anybody feels a doubt about a Commonwealth
note with that backing, he is a fool who is
beyond arguing with. And if, under pre-
sent circumstances, he pushes his doubt to
the extent of depreciating the Commonwealth
note issue, lie is an unpatriotic fool to boot.

The dividend on the old shares comes down to
0 p.c., which is 1 p.c. under the standard:
hence the directors notify that they have
“decided to raise the price of gas to 3s. lOd.
per 1000 ft., of which due notice will be
given.” The standard price fixed by the Act
of 1012 is 3s. 6d.; and for every Id. charged
beyond that the dividend on the old (“A”
and “B”) shares must he reduced i p.c.—
unless a Judge will certify that there has
been an increase in the' cost of production
sufficient to warrant the increase in price.
Thus far the co. has not been able to satisfy
the proper authority on this point. Some-
thing, certainly, has produced a slump in
profits, and it doesn’t appear to be a fall in
consumption. For the first half of 1913 the
revenue was £322.661; for the past half-
year £343.112. The directors refer to “the
partial dislocation of business and abnormal
conditions existing during the period of tran-
sition at: Mortlake,” and this has, no doubt,
been responsible for excessive costs and con-
sequent shrinkage of profits. In the half-
year to December 31 £311,064 was collected
from private gas-consumers. For manufac-
ture (which is kept apart from distribution)
the cost in wages and gratuities was £45,535.
In the manufacture of gas which, so far as
private consumers are concerned, brought in
£200,398 in the past half-year, the wages
cost was up to £49,337. On account of the
“partial dislocation” before mentioned, some
or all of the higher costs and lower profits
are, however, only temporary, and the half-
year’s figures are nothing to go upon. There
may be justification, apart from these figures,
for an increase in the price; for, in
view of the compromise embodied in the
Act, it would not be a fair thing to require
the co. to pay such higher wages as would
necessitate a reduction of the standard divi-
dend. But. if the higher wages cost is due to
a temporary disturbance (the result of chang-
ing-over from Darling Harbor to Mortlake,
the result of which will be to reduce costs
and increase protiis presently) the argument
for an advance does not apply. Presumably
the co. gets something for disturbance as
well as for the actual Darling Harbor pro-
perty taken over by the Government. If it
gets paid for disturbance in a lump sum, it
can’t reasonably ask to be paid for the same
disturbance in (lie shape of a higher price
for gas. Still, so far as one can see, the law
allows it. The dividend having been reduced

be automatically raised 4d. It looks as if there
is a flaw in this Act—as in most others.
During the half-year there has been a
heavy expenditure on capital account
amounting to £400,788; and as temporary
loans raised during this period were £263,462
(making the total £662,113) the directors
propose a debenture issue to fix the debt. At
present, of £2,522,616 charged to capital,
£1,275,000 is represented by “A” and “B”
shares (limited to 10 p.c., unless the price
of gas is put below 3s. 6d.), £255.000 by “C”
shares (limited to 7 p.c.), and £300,000 by
debentures; the balance (£692.616) has so
far been raised by overdrafts, etc.

This was one of the litter of the Queensland
boom of the late ’ciggies, and, like the rest
of them, it soon < id for the surgeon’s
knife. There were £1 shares and 15s. shares;
the former, on a revaluation of assets, were
written down to 14s. 6d. and the latter
to 9d. That left the co. with no capital to
speak of; and it had a business to watch.
Nevertheless a few live people with money
saw that there might be the foundations
for a profitable trade; so they took the thing
in hand, suppressed dividends for a time,
put every penny of profit back into the busi-
ness, called up more capital until there was
£60,000 of it, and gradually got the shares
out among free-house owners and others who
could do the co. most good. Meantime
Queensland was feeling entitled to extra
drinks on the strength of fine wool clips,
good meat prices and record sugar harvests.
This co. also saw a chance to specialise in
bottled stuff, and jumped at it, all the more
eagerly because it reckoned that, if the
Wowser should prevail and pubs were shut,
it was the bottle trade that would get the
most advantage. When its competition and
that of another smallish concern began to be
worth taking notice of, a beer war started,
and there was a check in the growth of pro-
fits! Then things were arranged in the usual
manner, and, with improved premises and
new plant supplied partly out of the new
capital and partly out of the co.’s own
savings, trade moved on rapidly. The next
table shows some details: —

Management . . 11,715 20,065 22,313 26,502
For many years, as shown above, the bulk
of the profits were written off, and the money
used to make replacements, etc. Apparently
the management reckons that assets are
worth at least book value; wherefore a con-
tingency fund of £7OOO has shown up among
the reserves, and £3870 is now added to it.
The arrival of this visible contingency re-
serve seems, in short, to be a hint that the
directors find that £7OOO more than was
necessary had been written off assets; and
that being so it looks as though the £7OOO
plus the £3780 now appropriated for that
fund might properly be added to the re-
serves. But even if the £3780 wasn’t true
profit, the year’s financial results would be
splendid; there would still be over £6OOO in
excess of the 9 p.c. div. Of course Brisbane
has had more money to burn than it can
hope to have generally, and the co.’s profits
may not keep up where they are; neverthe-
less" the concern has unquestionably worked
up a good, solid connection, and lias estab-
lished a popularity which it could hardly
have expected 10 years ago.

Included with the profit in the last line is
£2389 written off; and as the bulk at this
is against wear and tear of P l^’ c( |“ e rT t
profit is considerably less than £4989. How-
ever, it is substantial, and there is no visible
reason why it shouldn’t continue so. As '
matter of "fact, having most of the biggest
co-operative butter factories behind it, anc
therefore starting out with a ready-made
connection, it ought to have shown good pio-
fits from the beginning. Unfortunately it
tried to climb over difficulties which were
put in its way by getting a large stock ot
timber from Japan, and that was a disas-
trous move. Gradually that .stock was got
rid of—at a heavy loss —and no trouble is
found now in securing regular supplies ot
M.L. white pine. While the £30,000 worth
of Japanese timber was being worked pit,
interest and insurance had a big appetite.
To June, 1913, they cost the co. £3253 tor
the 12 months. In the past year the out-
goings under these heads were got down to
£2009. And they should go still lower when
more share capital is got in. Presumably
this will be done. At present only £lo,oio
is paid, and that isn’t enough to cover even
the stocks of timber in hand. Nor is it
likely that those stocks can be much reduced;
even with a timber-drying plant the wood
must have some seasoning. M.L. white pine
needs probably as little as any in the world,
because it is practically tasteless and odor-
less to begin with; but two months is none
too little to keep even this stuff, in view of
the use to which it is to be put. For the
other £25,000 or thereabouts required to
finance the business, and represented by a
freehold (which the co. got at the bargain
counter), book debts (£7228) and machinery,
the co. has to depend on the bank (£11,783),
an advance from its foster-parent, the
Coastal Farmers’ Co-op. Society (£4229),
and sundry creditors (£8180). Altogether,
the accounts show that the co. has made an
excellent recovery; and. besides promising a
future good return on the co-operators’ capi-
tal, it is even now unquestionably rendering
them fine service by providing them with
boxes at a price which they couldn’t have
hoped for had the co. not been born. In fact,
it was only born when the price was gradu-
ally pushed up from Is. Id. to Is. Bd. At
that time costs were much lower than they
are now; yet the present price of boxes runs
no higher than Is. 6|d.

Tinder ordinary circumstances that would
be quite sufficient security, provided the
risks extended no further than the estates
in hand. But the shareholders’ funds have
to back £16,637 of “sundry debtors” as
well. If these are advances made to un-
realised trust estates, mainly for the pur-
pose of paying probate duty, the security
should be good ; but “Father of Fifteen” an,d
“Constant Reader” like to make sure of
everything before they decide who is to
administer affairs when they are too dead
to do much administering themselves. And,
especially as the co. is up against a Govern-
ment Trustee, it would remove _ a doubt
which can’t be good for it if this item were
either reduced considerably or a fuller ex-
planation than “sundry debtors, £16,637”
given. To finance these loans the co. has
liabilities (thrown in one heap and labelled
“sundry creditors”) of £7307. The balance
of the funds is in a deposit with the State
Treasurer £5OOO. mortgages £5525, bank £731,
and property £3258. As usual, the business
shows a handsome profit, though the direc-
tors are evidently indisposed to suggest that
the figures will last. Anyway, 5 p.c. of the
present 15 p.c. div. is handed out in the
shape of a bonus.

The capital is now £106,250, and that and
the reserves provide enough for trading.
The liabilities amount to only £14,171 ; but
against that there is freehold and leasehold
property valued at £28.244. The financial
position is therefore very easy: if the co.
takes risks it any rate does it with its own
money, and doesn’t endorse anybody else’s
bills. How it would fare under specially
adverse Australian conditions isn’t too clear.
In the first half of 1904, when things were
bad in Sydney, it made a profit at the rate
of 12 p.c. p.a. on its then capital and
reserves; last half-year, under conditions of
general prosperity, it made just 10 p.e. p.a.
That looks as though the co. is liable to make
better profits when times are bad than when
they are good. Still, if bad conditions were
to last, a lot of the gilt might have to come
off the gingerbread. It may be that the co.
made no big losses in the bad times because
they were quickly followed by good times.
Anyway, in tliose bad times the co. set aside
some of its profits to build up a contingency
fund to allow of shrinkage in securities.
Luck stood to it —prosperity returned, and
the securities didn’t want protecting. If
any such provision has been made during the
recent long period of high prices for every-
thing, there is no trace of it in the accounts.
Perhaps there is a secret stocking some-
where. If not, it looks as though a time like
this might see the profits reduced
through a bad shrinkage in the value of
the co.’s pledges, etc. However, the writer con-
fesses with shame that he doesn’t know as
much about the innards of this business as
lie would like to. He never ran a Monty
I’eet. He has tried to get a treatise on the
Art and Mysteries of Pawnbroking, and
can’t. He appealed to an American college
that teaches everything by post. It replied
offering him special terms for a course of
card games—apparently the nearest thing
these univei’sal instructors, had in stock. In
desperation he annealed to Napthali, who is
in the business. “Learn?” exclaimed Napthali.
“Here’s noddings to learn. You lose und you
lose, und you go on doen id. Ain’dt id,

Tasmania had a dry time early in the year,
and it looks as though there was a run on
the brewery to moisten things a bit. Any-
way, net revenue from beer, etc., was £14.495
as agaiust £10,171 for the first half of 1913.
There was no corresponding increase in
operating expenses (salaries, travelling,
“trade,” etc.) ; so this meant a large in-
crease in profits. In addition, £670 has been
dropped into the “Property Reserve Fund,”
evidently profit on property sales —portion
of the cumbersome Cascade Estate, perhaps.
But whether the extra demand for beer is
to be a regular thing, or whether it is merely
a passing burst, the accounts don’t so much
as whisper. One satisfying result of the
exti'a profits and the sale of assets is that
the co. has been able to make an attack on
its overdraft, which stood six months ago at
£24,451. Now it has been carved down to
£19,412. Unfortunately a large amount of
the co.’s capital is in land which isn’t
earning its keep, and the co. appears to be
doing its best to replace it with something
more lucrative. The directors are finding it
a long job, though. Other liabilities, mostly
mortgages, are heavy, and the debt is
£113,124—a big weight for a co. with a capi-
tal of £lOB,OOO, and all the heavier because
much of it is unproductive.
The next table shows how various items
have moved :—-

The fact that so much interest is being paid
on unproductive assets explains the smallness
of the profits. However, this dead-weight
should be got rid of by degrees, and, maybe,
at prices in excess of book values. Mean-
time the company is building up a very fair
Australian trade, and, locally, is in the for-
tunate position of having no Cold Tea party
of any magnitude against it, though there is
no saying when Tasmania may be
afflicted with that just as it is with potato
blight and King O’Malley.

Half the mine’s at Broken Ilill are either
closed or closing down, and the others
are for the present working half time;
copper production at the big Cloncurry (Q.)
mines lias ceased, and there probably isn’t
one small copper producer at work in Aus-
tralia, the buyers having shut absolutely.
The resurrection of Cobar has been post-
poned indefinitely; and tin-mining has prac-
tically ceased throughout the Common-
wealth. the buyers of this metal also having
put their books away in the safe.
Yet with men and mines available there
is no reason whatever why Australia should
stop producing the industrial metals which
the world will want to buy as soon as the
war is over. The only question is one of
finance. And that is' not overwhelmingly
difficult. Three years or so ago, when the
markets were not propitious, many tens or
thousands of tons of Broken Hill zinc-lead
concentrates were stacked at Burns, on the
N.S.AY.-S.A. border, and they were there
for 12 months at least. If they could be
financed then, the same thing can be done
now. In that case the buyers, mostly Ger-
man, leaned up against Australian banks.
The latter presumably made advances
against metal certificates, which is the usual
practice. The same thing could be done
now, with a few modifications to meet the
circumstances.
The first question is: Who should do the
financing? It might be done most comfort-
ably through the credit of the Common-
wealth ; in other words, advances against the
output could be most conveniently made in
Commonwealth notes, which for internal
purposes are as good. as gold. Under the
arrangement made last week on behalf of
the Commonwealth and State Governments,
the banks are to be entitled to get £3 in
Commonwealth notes on depositing with the

Federal Treasury fl in gold, and the State
Governments may draw £4 in notes for £1
in gold. The Commonwealth, that is to say,
lends the banks in the one case £2, and in
rhe other case £3, and gets 4 p.c. for it. Now
the banks might possibly advance out of the
money thus borrowed enough to finance the
producing mines, taking the product as
security. Whether they will feel justified in
doing this business is another matter. The
metal prices at which the advances are to
be made would, of course, be a matter of
arrangement. Whoever made the advance
would not make it to the full present value
of the metals. But copper at £4B, lead at
£l4, zinc at £l7 10s.. silver a.t 2s. and tin
at £lOO ought to be perfectly safe proposi-
tions.
On advances at such prices it would be
impossible in most cases to pay the present
rates of wages. But that difficulty could be
got over by paying such a reduced rate of
wages as an accountant might certify to be
necessary, issuing at the same time a coupon
entitling the holder to an additional payment
on the sale of the output if the price then
warranted it—so much extra per day for a
realisation of (say) £1 in excess of £4B for
copper, and so on. (In practice it would
probably be best to pay the excess on the
basis of the average metal prices 12 months
after peace is proclaimed.) Though the
banks might handle this business it would
be an advantage in many ways if the Com-
monwealth worked the whole of it through
the Commonwealth Bank. There would,
for one thing, be le.ss difficulty in persuad-
ing the men to take a reasonable view of
the matter of reduced payments, and there
would be far less doubt about the value of
the excess coupons. Also the business would
come cheaper to the mining companies and
the miners, etc., for if the banks make the
advances and take the risks they will natu-
rally want to be paid for it; and this is a
case where no profits ought to be looked for,
and where the risk (if any) should be borne
by the Commonwealth. Besides, the banks
will have plenty to do in financing the pas-
toral, agricultural, manufacturing and ordi-
nary trading concerns.
If the Commonwealth finances the pro-
ductive mines, making advances against
metal certificates, there would no doubt have
to be a special issue of Commonwealth notes.
Ordinarily a Commonwealth note must have
25 p.c. of gold lodged and maintained against
it. A productive mining co. may have 1000
tons of copper, or 10,000 tons of zinc-lead
concentrates, but it may not have a single
golden sovereign to lodge with the Treasury.
But that should be no insuperable difficulty;
for if it is safe to issue £4B of Treasury
notes against £.12 of gold, surely in a time
like this, in order to continue the production
of wealth, of which the country is capable,
it is not only perfectly safe but highly desir-
able to issue £4B of Treasury notes against
a quantity of copper which, at the present
moment, is worth over £6O, has not been
worth less than £5O for many years, and,
on account of the vast consumption in this
war, will probably be worth £65 as soon as
peace is declared! The Commonwealth
Bank or any other authority might be
authorised to undertake this special issue
so as to keep it distinct from the ordinary
issue of Commonwealth notes. They would
of course carry interest : that is to say, the
company lifting them against a metal certi-
ficate would pay (say) 4 p.c. until January
1, 1916, when the note would be payable in
gold. This would mean revenue for the
Commonwealth ; and, much more important,
it would mean continuing the wealth-pro-
duction of the country. And this is of enor-
mous importance, because, war or peace,
rain or fine, our vast interest bill has to be
paid.. We shall want all the help we can
in that direction next year, for wheat and
flour shipments will be small on account of
the now-certain failure or partial failure of
the harvest in S. Aus., Victoria and Riverinh.;
and for the same reason the wool clip will
be deficient.
The first move must be taken by the Com-
monwealth Government. If the Prime Mini-
ster will call a conference, inviting Fisher
and Hughes. (Labor), BaiHieu and Colin
Templeton (mine-owners). Delprat or
Courntney (managers), Miller (Common-
wealth Bank) and F. H. Snow (metal
buyer, who knows all about metal account-
ancy), details could be arranged in a day.

“Praeeo” : It must make a few men
thoughtful to observe that the six Australian
States have to renew loans next year amount-
ing to £16.714,320, by far .the largest lot to
be arranged until 1924, when £81,682,214
will have to be settled, chiefly by N.S.W.
and Q. The 1915 list runs thus': N.S.W.,
£3,881.081; Vic., £525.000; Q.. £11,722.800;
S.A.. £311,975; W.A., £85,840; and Tas.,
£181.624. The inherited curse of that fixed
date for repayment of our public loans will
ifiall heavily on Australia in the near years.
British Consols are interminable. Why not
Australian debentures? Why should the
terms of our loans range from 15 to 50
years? Why should there be so many vari-
ous forms of bonds, inscribed stock, deben-
tures and Treasury bills, with a very few
interminable securities? If for nothing else
but to simplify and make permanent our
debt obligations, their conversion by the
Commonwealth Government is imperative.
Not, let me add quickly, that an interminable
debt cannot be paid off. The great point is
that they can be liquidated in good times, as
British Consols are, while there is no danger
of a renewal having to be negotiated in bad
times when money is scarce and interest
rates are cruel.

Daniel Grove’s contribution to the discus-
sion of Australian diamonds: It is generous
of Mr. Havelock Smith to admit (B.
30/7/T4) that the Mount Boss co. has done
some useful work, and I daresay the mining
community at Copeton will be astonished to
learn, from such an impartial authority,
that the property was proved, by its earlier
owners, to yield seven carats of diamonds
per 100 loads of washdirt treated. No men-
tion has been made of the quality of the
tailings from. the old gear, nor has any
credit been given to the present owners for
making such an alleged low-grade proposi-
tion yield a good livelihood. It is difficult
to imagine that a man of Mr. . Havelock
Smith’s wide experience on the South
African and Australian diamond-fields would
allow new, virgin ground to remain un-
prospected ; yet it is said by men on the
field that for some years he has modestly
declined to. place his knowledge and capital
at the service of the mining community in a
search for large diamonds. I personally
take full responsibility for inducing my
Holland-Belgium principals to have the
field examined, and several propositions
tested, believing, as I did, and do. in the
reports made to me by Messrs. A. R. Pike,
Walter Hill, Peter Rooney and William
Cross, which have since been corroborated
by independent experts, whose credentials I
have reason to believe will compare favor-
ably with those of Mr. Havelock Smith. I
state publicly that Dr. Fuldaner, on whose
good name I allowed his group credit for
£BOOO cash expended by me, and whose in-
terests I have since upheld because I be-
lieve they mean to open the Australian fields
when the conditions are more favorable, has
done more for Australian diamonds than has
Mr. Havelock Smith, who now sits in judg-
ment on the entire industry.

Resolution of a meeting of diamond miners
held at Copeton (N.S.W.) on August 8:
“That we, representing the various diamond
mines of Copeton, express indignation con-
cerning Mr. Havelock Smith’s statements in
The Bulletin of July 80, regarding the in-
dustry and its prospects in this district, the
same being misleading in many points, and
in opposition to facts.”

The Mabel mine, at Wiseman’s Creek,
Oberon district (N.S.W.), has put up the
shutters after a brief career under the all-
solution system. Ore operated on was the
gossan capping of the copper lode, on which
the once fairly-payable Phoenix mine is situ-
ated. The gold is fine, derived from the
decomposition of the sulphides, and acid and
iron salts are present in appreciable
amounts. Underfoot the carbonates come
in, and working at any great depth is thus
precluded so far as cyaniding ore is con-
cerned. Still there is a pretty large quan-
tity to be obtained above the carbonates, as
the shoots (it may be one shoot) of gold
extend a considerable distance; and if the
gold could be saved, there are many worse
properties than little Mabel. But as only a
very poor extraction can be made by amal-
gamation, and as present proceedings indi-
cate that the all-solution process is not satis-
factory, the circumstances are not favorable.
WiTfc acid copper and iron salts to interfere
chemically with cyaniding, and with baryta
to give trouble mechanically, Mabel can
supply many obstacles in the race for wealth..
Low values and high difficulties are a bad
combination; but they were tackled plucltily,
and all honor to those who courageously
failed.
Hawkins Hill Reward (N.S.W.) is going
slow with development in order to put out
a good crushing. In July the mill crushed
90 tons for 89oz. A new reef has been cut
at the 200 ft. level from the Exhibition shaft,
and prospects so far have been about loz.
per ton for a width of 12in. The deepest
level at 320 ft. vertical has failed to pick up
the rich stone so long talked about, but
quartz leaders in favorable slate country
may lead to something better. There is
18in. of loz. stone at No. 1 winze, so calls
should not be necessary for some time.

Because it took £3849 to win tin worth
£3300 in six months at the Melbourne
Cope’s Creek claim at Tingha (N.S.W.),
the two plants working are to go on single
shift. No. 1 is on lb. tin but with costs
at over Bsd. per cubic yard, and the metal
where it is a bigger yardage will need to
be sluiced before there is a decent margin.
No. 2 plant costs, 10M. per cubic yard, are
even worse, but the ground is tight and
labor dear.
* * * *
Elsmore is another Tingha tin co. in
Jimmy Mackay’s office that feels the pinch
of hard times through the flopping of the
metal market, and it took £3765 to get tin
worth £3460. That isn’t payable, so one
shift is ordered. The consolation held
out to the shareholders is that the two
plants have at least 12 months ahead in
their present paddocks, and that the
machinery is in better order than ever
before.
Work at Cock’s Pioneer Eldorado. Vic.,
is on behalf of a mixed London-Melhonrne
crowd, with Y-Water Moline finding the
brains. Co. is to have a slap-up plant to
replace Jack Dane’s rattle-traps, as Bull
put up plenty of cash for the show, believ-
ing that, he had little to risk. From next
month on Moline will discover the truth
about the three-layer ground at Eldorado.
-Die co.s balance-sheet shows that he will
start with about £lO,OOO in hand and so
miss the financial gruelling got by the
Adelong Estates because of cutting into
heavy clay. Cock’s Pioneer’s new barge
will work up stream, and, as the old plant
cut out the paddock before Bull bought in.
Moline’s will get into the pay-dirt from the
start. He is wise to leave behind him the
big block of untested drift extending up to
the boundary of Langford’s claim. Dane's
old co. averaged per cubic yard about Is. sd.
from tin and gold, and paid divs. with a
patched-up plant. Tf Moline gets the same
grade working to where Dane’s plant
stopped, he will soon add to- the Collins
House gold reserves.
* * * *
Outtrim-llowitt, having been elbowed out
of the Powlett Basin by the Victorian Gov-
ernment, has lit out for Kilcunda. The
old mine is a mere shadow of the past,
unable to bear State charges and working
costs and then give Private Enterprise a
bite. A whole lot of faith will have to be
packed behind Kilcunda, for it only counts
on a 24ft. seam near the shaft. A bit east,
bores show the coal thickening out to Sift.,
but with faults and high costs. The new
mine seems to have been got on job-lot
terms and is now at work. As the Outtrim
pit gave only 8000 tons of coal for the half-
year, the move-on clause had to be enforced.
* •* * *
During the first six months of this year
16 Charters Towers mines, employing 898
men. crushed $8,771 tons of stone for
£101,894. The most important returns were :
Brilliant Extended (9875 tons) ..£26,713
Brilliant Deeps (3683 tons) . . 13,049
Mills United (3009 tons) . . .. 12,523

Gympie (Q.) didn’t close its Stock Exchange
because of the war scare —business became
so dull that there was no necessity to close.
No. Columbia’s Od. dividend cost £l6OO,
and the mine has the distinction of supply-
ing the State Government with specimens
valued at £350 for exhibition purposes. A
State-subsidised mine, Columbia Consoli-
dated, is said to have cheerful pro-
spects. G,nn [tie’s total for July was 10,320
tons for 37270 z. smelted gold. Of this the
Scottish gave 12210 z. from 5000 tons, and
No. 3 Columbia 1050 oz. from 839 tons.

Melbourne office of Lode Hill, Cooktown
(N.Q.), hands out its second half-
year’s accounts. The surplus is £2625,
of which £1283 is cash, and the
balance a valuation on 13 tons 2cwt. of
oxide on hand. On the same basis, work-
ing profit on an output of 47 tons 17cwt. of
tin oxide is £2099. The oxide therefore
goes into the accounts at practically £lOO
per ton. Gaps in the co.’s report are the
grade of the tin concentrates and working
costs, which, roughed out, appear to run to
about £54 10s. per ton of tin oxide. Stiff'
going this for a mine having plenty purling
water and an easy run for slum. First
return was 214 tons from 30,000 cubic yards;
the third 11} tons from 55,000 cubic yards.
On top of this the co. got into a cyclone in
the metal market, and, last of all, ran into
a belt of stones 24 chains wide left by the
original owners. Reading between the* lines
it looks as if Manager Northey had only a
toe of drift to sluice before he butted against
this. People down south await chairman
Turner’s reading of the lesson over this
little surprise packet.
Mount Lyell’s four-weekly output of blister
copper was 673 tons, the best for two years.
The amount smelted was 27,949 tons com-
pared with 26,434 tons for the previous four
weeks. Fine copper contained in blister
(665 tons) is 91 tons better than the pre-
vious return, and the average extraction has
improved to 2.41 p.c. copper per ton of ore,
although some of this improvement may be
due to the rich ore being obtained at the
lowest level, 1100 ft. The entire return was
665 tons copper, 34,2060 z. silver and 8760 z.
gold. Costs run to about £30,000 per month.
* * * *
Mount Lyell Blocks at the half-yearly
meeting announced its intention of raising
fresh capital to go on with the sink and to
drive at 1200 ft. and 1300 ft. in search of
ore underlaying into the Blocks’ lease'. Co.
spent £13,702 in 12 months, and the avail-
able capital and calling power has now been
exhausted. Shareholders are practically
asked to back the opinion of one mining man
against another.

Associated Northern iW.A.) is in trouble
again. The gas engine which was to com-
plete the sulphide plant on the co.’s Victori-
ous mine at Ora Banda was to have been
shipped from “ ’Ome” last month, but so far
no intimation of it having been despatched
has come to hand, and the possibilities are
that it is not yet on the water. So the co.
may decide to keep most of the £3OOO a
month it is now’ spending on development in
its pocket until the engine arrives and
enables gold production to be resumed. An
offer by tributors to re-treat on a royalty
basis the big pile of already re-treated resi-
dues on the Iron Duke (Kalgoorlie) lease is
being considered by (lie Board.
Siberia Consols (W.A.), of which The
Bulletin was never an admirer, expects to
crush 200 tons this month for a return of
between £BOO and £9OO. Management
reckons that future returns will pay for all
exes, including development; but the reports
on which the show was buoyed up at the
time of flotation prophesied more than this.
From all accounts the property isn’t good
enough for a co., and if it were, the want of
sufficient capital would prevent it from
surviving.
The Melbourne Mary Mac Co. is doubling
its 10-liead mill and adding grinding pans,
cyanide vats, and other things to its tieat-
inent plant on the Lady Harriet at Laverton
(W.A.). The workings are reported to he
showing good stone and the mine's barrack-
ers declare that returns will justify the
duplication of the plant.
Collie (W.A.) produced 100,723 tons of
coal for the six months ended June, or Slob
tons more than during the liist half of 1013;
527 men were employed, and of these 102
were underground workers. Additions and
improvements are continually being made to
the plants on the mines, but development
work is said to be a bit backward.

Westralia exported £08.140 worth of
minerals other than gold during the first
half of this year, and of Ibis sum £24,225
represented tin; £28,031 silver-lead ore;
£B3lB copper; £11,058 silver; and £25,880
miscellaneous. The value of the segregate
exports to June 30 was £3,543,207, nearly
half of that amount being made up of copper
and tin.

APPENDICITIS FREQUENT.
NUMBERLESS SOCIETY PATIENTS.
[From Our Special Representative.]
London, Wednesday, 11.10 p.m.
Operations for appendicitis are becoming common
amongst society folk. The latest case is that of Sir
Charles Oust, equerry to the King, who accompanied
him on his Australian tour when Duke of York.
Appendicitis during recent years has become very
ordinary throughout the civilised world, and it is
held in many professional centres that before appen-
dicitis was correctly diagnosed numberless deaths
resulted, the physicians being at that time under the
impression the cause of death was peritonitis or in-
flammation of the bowels. Medical men, with the
educated finger-touch that comes with active prac-
tice, readily diagnose the complaint to-day, aided by
symptoms only too easily recognised.
Medical science of to-day has reduced this opera-
tion to an almost painless nature, but prolonged
weakness often ensues, as is shown in the case of Mr.
P. R. Miles, who was operated on in Melbourne last
year. In an appendicitis sense, his case was similar
to that of thousands of others, but the weakness that
ensued baffled all attempts to cure, and as he repre-
sented one of the largest commercial firms resident
in Australasia, his life was a very valuable one.
Prescriptions and medicines were alike useless to him
until he, as a last resource, took Clements Tonic,
the great nerve and brain medicine, and in a mirac-
ulously short time his strength and health were re-
stored. His nerves are now as sound as steel; he says
he is completely cured. As all chemists and stores
sell this medicine, it would be wise for all wevik-
nerved people to get it and get well.*

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, August 17, 1914.
My Dear Akini, —
There has been wrinkling of fore-
heads over the Mayoral hop in honor of the
British Blue Socks. This is timed —war
permitting—for August 24. The notion of
substituting a heavyweight form of enter-
tainment is in favor with the ’Varsity set
which is up to its eyebrows in Berlin wool —■
beg pardon, Mr. Censor, I meant knitting
yarn. As only 10 per cent, of the company
at these huge official crushes ever attempts
to dance under any circumstances, no one
need be afraid of too much frivolity on this
occasion. The spectacle of the right wing
of British Science being dragged into a
Lancers’ skirmish, and looking over its spec-
tacles for help from its absent-minded main
body, is likely to be the most frisky event of
the evening.
Professor Morgan, who hails from Dublin,
is going to shelter under the Tom Watsons’
roof at Double Bay, while he chats about
Science in this city. The Watsons are also
Irish by persuasion, and are descended from
King Nial of the Showers, or Nial of the
Hostages, or Flan of the Shannon, or some
other grand old warrior.
Mrs. W. B. Ma cart bur is putting up Pro-
fessor Wheeler at Kingsclerc, the huge, sky-
scraping flats that look like a brick gridiron
from our blue-water front.
Dr. W. M. Tattersall, of the learned,
spectacled brigade, will have every induce-
ment to cultivate a knowledge of Our
Harbor while he is in Sydney. He unpacks
his valuable ideas in the Christian house-
hold at Tudor, Elizabeth Bay. This beauti-
ful site, with terraced gardens falling into
the waters of the bay, which splash against
n stone rampart, used to be occupied by the
.T. C. Williamson menage. The view that
Tattersall’s eye will sweep—this is no allu-
sion to any Melbourne Cup sweep of the
same name- —suggests the blue and green
effects of an Italian lake after a spring
cleaning.
Staff-Surgeon Robinson, R.N., who mar-
ried pretty Grace Aclieson, of this city,
packed up his medical kit for the North
Sea a week or two ago. Mamma
Acheson gets a carefully-worded cable re
her only chick now and then. Just now
Grace is in the South of England.
Battle pictures in our National Gallery
are drawing the casual public like honey-
pots. The great canvas that shows the
famous charge of French Hussars at
Friedland, in 1807, was surrounded the
other afternoon bv mild city men and young
children, drinking in Detaille’s brush
work. Fighting, in the days when French
troops yelled “Vive l’Empereur,” was a
hand-to-hand affair, with such a dense cloud
of dust round a cavalry rush that one
wonders how many victims on eacli side
were hurriedly slaughtered by their own
friends before they gripped their enemies
by the throat.
Queensland is said to be searching the
British horizon for a spare Admiral as its
next Governor. There has been a whisper
of the nopular name of KingTlall —the best
naval barracker in the matter of an Aus-
tralian fleet this country has had, barring
Admiral Henderson.
The A. B. Piddingtons’ domicile in
Woollahra will roof Professor Jungerseu
and his wife during the invasion of Know-
ledge in the gross. Jungersen has a peace-
ful Danish sound, or possibly it is Swedish.
(No allusion to the Sound which Separates
these two countries.) Anyhow, it is war-
ranted not to go off suddenly if someone
sits on the Kaiser’s topknot for five
minutes.
Sydney’s well-known water-waggoner,
Archdeacon Boyce, .of St. Paul’s, Redfern,
who is going to and fro upon the earth seek-
ing health, accepted a chaplaincy under the
Colonial and Continental Church Society,
and was stationed at a place in Germany,
the name of which sounds remarkably like
Badlanguage-walbach fthe spelling being
Bad-Langenschwalbach). He expected to
remain until July 25. He was in Germany
on July 8, since when his family have had
no tidings. His Sydney congregation has
cabled to London in the hope of receiving
news re the text of his last week’s sermon.
The Archdeacon is 70 years of age, and has
been 46 years pursuing the horned Enemy
with the barbed tail.
Our tennis champion, Norman Brookes,
and his wife were week-ending under the
haughty Marlborousrh roof when a late mail
left London. Charles Richard, etc.,
Spencer-Churchill has various roofs, of
course—not including those humble ones
he recently sold “in person”—but the most
interesting ought to be Blenheim House,
stuffed with loot of the famous Churchill’s
swashbuckling career.
Lady Patey opened a sale of all sorts —
with a multitude of kitchen saucepans and
able-bodied pans in the rear —for the Ladies’
Home Mission Fund, the other afternoon. In
consequence of the address of this show hav-
ing; been changed from the Concordia Hall at
the last minute, the Chapter House, a dismal
kind of crypt off St. Andrew’s Cathedral, was
hung with doyleys and similar domestic
gauds. There was no air worth men-
tioning in this stone sarcophagus. So
the company panted round the stalls,
purple in the face, but firmly re-
solved to buy something it didn’t
want, or asphyxiate in the struggle. Mrs.
Brady’s pretty youngster, a vision in flaxen
curls and orchid mauve, passed the Admi-
ralty lady the usual floral tribute. His
Anglican Legs pronounced a blessing on the
lingerie present, and Mrs. Archbishop’s
commanding presence was in front of events.
Mrs. Baronet Cooper’s best blue feathers
tossed aloft in the buying arena, and the
whole gathering saved its individual lives
by dashing into the open air as soon as it
dared leave the doyleys by themselves. The
Ladies’ Home Mission aims at giving the
small clerical fry a scrape of butter, instead
of dripping, when times are hard.
Tenor Dufault inclined his ear to the
youthful warble of Madeline Collins and Ella
Goodman. He has issued the following ulti-
matum: The former girl is a fine dramatic
soprano, and the latter has a pretty chirp
suitable for light opera. The maidens will
now pursue their vocal gymnastics with
renewed energy.
Mrs. Mayoress Richards handed over
£290 to the Mater Misericordiae Hospital
authorities one glad day last week. This
prize money was the result of the July ball
in our Town Hay-loft, or Hollow Municipal
Void. The function was organised by
honorary organiser Mrs. Leahy, of Mosman.
She was generalissimo, and the way she led
her troops to victory suggests that she
should have inherited Huerta’s job when he
found it too big for him. There seems to
be no reason why the 1915 ball for this
haven for sick women and children shouldn’t
collect a £5OO cheque.
The Nurses’ Club ball committee still
hopes to pull its forthcoming revel, in aid
of a building fund, to a successful climax on
August 26. The Salon de Luxurious and
Romaine’s orchestra —which is It in dance
music—contribute to the gaiety of this hop.
Glad Rags, as displayed at various spring
shows, have been pushed into a retired
corner during the rush of politics. Almost
everybody has postponed the purchase of a
new blouse until hearing whether a Servian
general, with a name like chronic bronchitis,
has, or has not, shoved his army across a
river that sounds like a bird-cage in fits.
If these names were easier to pronounce
there might be more business doing,
but when a magnificent warrior named
I’zzkfptbszzrxxxxbj is fighting the good
fight in our cause on the banks of the river
L>jkh and everything- hangs in the balance
it is difficult to fix our thoughts on a yard
or two of ninon. Still, here goes! Bustles
predominate as the last whoops of Fashion.
The busy housewife who wears a camel’s
hump behind might use it to stow away
provisions on the march to the drawing-
room front. Black and white, a safe blend
in these uncertain days, rejuvenates the
shiny black glace of long ago. Hips are
built up under formidable outworks of puffs,
and you have to be Dolly Yarden below the
waist, and fish-tail round your heels.
Colors are like the tints in tropic orchids.
Hats are pancakes folded down, or spiky
towers that toss their plumes like the tail
of Chanticleer in a head wind.
Dorothy Holmes, daughter of Mr. Holmes
of the Water and Sewerage Board, was mar-
ried the other day to Reginald Travers.
Holmes, senior, is Colonel in a local
militia regiment, which is gnashing its
sword to be up and at it. Grandpa
Holmes was an old Imperial fight-
ing man, latterly chief clerk to the N.S.W.
khaki forces, when Dawes Point battery
was in working order and a matter of inter-
est to adjacent nursemaids.
Sydney Grammar School boys have shown
their common sense by saving the cash usu-
ally spent in trophies at their yearly sports.
Victors at these 1914 local Olympian games
may be crowned with anything handy—a few
sprigs of parsley or a cauliflower leaf—and
will go away with a certificate instead of a
silver mug. Half a hundred pounds—the
saving mentioned —has been hurried off to
Mayor Richards’s patriotic nest-egg.
The Cedric Bowkers, who belong to this
city of blue waters and blue skies and
islands and old traditions, are in London
just now, under grey skies and beside
muddy waters. After skimming over Eng-
lish roads in a swift petrol chariot, they
retired in good order to the arena of Russell
square.
Professor Benjamin Moore, who has been
dealing out physiology to Melbourne in the
gathering of Blue Socks, is going to camp
with Dr. H. G. Chapman—a local pillar of
the welcome committee —during his stay in
Sydney.
The October Dolls’ Carnival m aid of the
Alexandra Hospital has had all the sawdust
knocked out of it. Young men who were
going- to prance round as elephants, kanga
roos and peacocks in the Noahs Ark se
now absorbed in the Weltpolitik. (I think
that is how it is spelled, and 1 don t care it
it isn’t.) One of them who was going to he
a light and airy kangaroo stopped me yester-
day to ask my opinion about getting up an
expedition to nrevent the Arabs seizing
Siberia. The Dolls’ frivol is packed up till
further notice.
Dr. Emma Buckley, a graduate of Syd-
ney Uni., puts aside her stethoscope every
Monday evening to lecture on lurst Aid at
the ambulance classes under t,lie Girls Realm
wing in Vickery’s Chambers. Talks on the
right way to bandage continue till JU per
cent, of our girls begin to tie up the furni-
ture 011 sight. Even piano legs are not sate
in this rush for knowledge. A juvenile
enthusiast who smashed her parents best
gamp, the other day, so that she could ban-
dage its broken ribs, is not held up as a
domestic example of Force applied to the
best purpose.
Barrister Hanbury Davies got a firm giip
of a local Red Cross meeting which was
beginning to fall over itself in avoirdupois
weight last week. Miss Gould, one of our
star nightingales —with South African ex-
perienee—brushed aside a few cobwebs irorn
the lorgnettes of those present. Dr. Stone
Dixson, who preaches First Aid all the year
round, also handed the company some valu-
able advice.
The Gentleman Help service has been
hastily reorganised, since so many recent
importations have dashed off. Lord I reddie
Blackwood, Captain Anstruther and little
Help Henry Talbot, a loo’tenant in the 11th
Hussars, also A.D.C. Gale (on the Vic-
torian Governor’s staff) are now bumping
about in the Egypt after a frantic rush to
stuff their gorgeous uniforms into cabin-
trunks and put their hair-oil in the hold.
Lady Freddie went off from Sydney with
the Egypt contingent, and hopes to wait in
England while her tall soldier waves his
sword on the battlements of Jerusalem.
About the most dashing-looking aide who
fled from Sydney was Captain Hopwood, of
the South Australian sub-regal humpy.
Ilopwood, whose male parent is Under Sec-
retary of State for the Colonies, amongst
many other things, departed in the Will*
ochra.
The N.S.W. Patriotic Fund, which wants
a violent shaking up to bring it into line
with Victoria’s big financial whack, is going
to have an immediate prod from various
local mummers. The Little Theatre, bustles
into action with a matinee before this meets
your ruminating glance. Hugh Ward is acting
commander-in-chief of another huge matinee
for the Fund. It is bringing such a rush
of stage volunteers who want to do their
bit, that the J.C.W. tetrarch will arrange
the forthcoming campaign with a wet towel
firmly affixed to his massive brow.
Librarian Hugh Wright, of our Mitchell
Library, is gathering musty MSS. at the
present moment. The Sydney man left Lon-
don in July for France and Spain, to peer
into moth-eaten records of early Austral-
asian story. There are said to be many
odds and ends of our ancient narrative to
be found in Spain, for the old dons were
wonderful navigators, and it isn’t quite cer-
tain even yet that they didn’t land on the
Queensland coast before the Dutch and
British and Portuguese were around, and
say mass in the neighborhood of Mary-
borough.
Dr. and Mrs. Chenhall, of this township,
with small son Freddie in tow, mean to do
some more European sights before rushing
up the gangway of an Australian-bound
craft at old picturesque Genoa. The date
of their return is uncertain.
“Yesterday,” writes Kate Rooney from
London, “the newest thing from Sydney in
baby sopranos came to sing to me. I mean
lima Elliot. Her voice is deliciously pure
and sweet. Very wisely she is going first
to Italy to complete her studies... .When
she returns to London engagements will be
waiting for her.... 1 think this is a big-
feather in the cap of my dear old teacher,
Mrs. Christian, who has given lima her
entire training.” Concerning herself. Kate
writes in high spirits after a strenuous 12
months in America. Part of the Sydney
contralto’s English holiday is laid out in
studying the leading contralto roles in
“Aida,” “Trovatore” etc., for a late autumn
tour in Robyn’s Opera Co.
Mrs. Gleeson is bustling round a concert
in St. James’s Hall, to help the Sydney Day
Nursery funds. This event will march on
to a suburban victory, for the kiddies’
nursery at Forest Lodge, on August 28.
Our First Australian Infantry celebrated
its Diamond Jubilee with the loud popping
of chamnagne corks at the Australia. A
guard of honor that flashed cold steel under
the glittering arc-lights in Castlereagh-
street flung out its chest and tramped for-
ward to meet Governor Strickland. For
10 minutes or so this comparatively peace-
ful city street—where the roaring tram-
cars roll onward to the quay —was full of
warlike feathers and bayonets.
Professor Pope, a big British gun >r
howitzer in chemistry, who was handed a
Doctor of Science degree in Melbourne, will
wear his new frill at the Medical Lightoller
lireside, while he unfurls his umbrella in
this settlement.
The Austral String Quartet, with fiddler
Cyril Monk in command, recently gave, as a
new offering to the hungry maw of local
music fiends, a quintet for piano and strings
by Fritz Volbach.
The Kindergarten Union put on its best
bonnets to sally forth to a meeting at State
Government House on a recent fine after-
noon. The Strickland ladyship presided.
General-secretary Ellen Desailly, in her
spring millinery; Mrs. Francis Anderson
(one of the founders of the Free Kiddygarten
schools here) ; Miss Harriet Duinolo, the
youthful principal of the training college for
teachers of the cult; and Mrs. Dane orated
round the long list of things done, and
money spent, in the cause. Pastoralist
John Mackay, president of the Cult of the
Unsmacked Child, and a bulwark of the
Free Kindergarten schools--where babes are
taught nice manners and (he correct use of
hankies —made a few non-combative remarks.
The big American, Mr. Boorman, an old
friend of the Cause, rounded up the speeches
with the hope of good times to come. The
brand-new A.D.C., Wakeman looked as
cheerful as circumstances permitted. Before
stamping down the red gravel path to its
blustering trams, those present fell upon
the sub-regal refreshments with great
slaughter. The bun had no more chance
than the Egyptians in the Red Sea.
The final Dufault warble in the Town
Hall repeated the success of the tenor’s
previous concerts here. Encore fiends,
ravenous for more —some day these Oliver
Twists may be tamed down to more reason-
able demands —kept Paul’s evening slippers
on the trot from the artist’s den under the
growling organ to the municipal dais.
Legions of damsels in the galleries waved
a frantic farewell, after the tenor had con-
ducted the National Anthem to a full stop.
Premier Holman and his wife wandered
in to hear Dufault say good-bye to Sydney.
The N.S.W. politician looked a very weary
man, with the coal dust of the journey from
Melbourne hastily brushed off his top-coat
and the cinders hardly removed from his
back hair.
Much sympathy is offered to the well-likec
literary man. Dowell O’Reilly, whose wife —
formerly a Miss Piddington of this city—
passed over the shadowy border the other day.
Dowell, by the way, is only literary and
poetic in his spare time. He usually drives
his work-a-day quill in the Civil Service.
His booklet. “Tears and Triumph,” which
places Woman in the animal kingdom as a
useful maternal beast of somewhat limited
intelligence—except in the cow-like finality
of carefully tending her young—is a queer,
clever outbreak against modern feminism.
A well-known Australian journalist, who
put in 15 years solid work on the London
press, was not impressed with the type of
male pussy who writes Society notes on one
or two papers in John Bull’s antheap. “They
have been known for years as ‘mealers,’ and
frankly use their position to fare sumptu-
ously—-on the nod.” They are noted “walk-
ing stomachs,” and their impartial (?)
news is regarded by the people who feed
them as the direct reward for services ren-
dered. Women are not lured by food in the
same way. The average presswoman, if she
has a thin skin, holds aloof from the Society
crowd which is willing to pay its parasites
in kind —expensive food, seats in its innumer-
able cars (when no one more important is
about) and other social perquisites. The
returned Australian opines that the few male
lackeys on the press count for little against
the herd of women scribes who munch their
humble lodging-house hash seven days a
week.
Paling’s people publish a new song with
the title, “Good-bye, Dear Heart.” The
words are by Henry de Witt. The melody,
by Percy Dixon, flows softly round the
crooning verse. The title is absolutely
original. No one previously struck the idea
of “good-bye” as a song theme.
Our ex-G.-G. Denman recently told Lon-
doners that they might do more for visiting
Australians than was their wont. The pre-
sent visit of the British spectacles bears out
the Denman argument, that the Common-
wealth exudes hospitality to the strangers
within its gates.
That oddment in dukes. His Grace of
Manchester, who may be described as an
outsize in peers, has now added to his
accomplishments the r6le of “exploration
and geographical secretary” to a moving-
picture corporation. This body proposes. to
elevate the plain citizen by supplying
churches and institutions with “educational”
films. Possibly the average cleric isn’t look-
ing for more Light in his parish from that
will-o’-the-wisp of Manchester.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, August 17, 1914.
My Dear Yarrie,—
A young Australian doctor, Judah Jona,
has lately tacked up his brass-plate in the
practitioners’ paradise of Malvern, where
patients are both prosperous and numerous
enough to provide for those who help them
to die comfortably. Dr. .Tona commenced
collecting degrees in Adelaide. Continuing
the hobby in Europe he happened to he in
the Balkans when trouble arose there, and
kept on arising. Offers were made him by
two of the a risers; but Jona thought of
another Land of Promise, and pleaded an
Australian engagement. Asa private citi-
zen. however, young Jona saw a good deal
of the gory doings which ensued, and finds
Malvern quite a ladylike suburb after the
blood-and-tliunder happenings of the corpse-
strewn regions around Boastchook. Dr.
.Tona recently married into the family of
Austral Hat-Miller Kozminsky.
Sir Edward Schafer and his wife were
the guests of honor on Wednesday _ after-
noon last week, when Dr. Jona and his wife
received their friends at the Oriental. The
.Tona medico, of Malvern, struck up a. friend-
ship with the Schafer knight in England last
year, when lie was scientifically researching
at the Lyster Institute. In fact, Ihe
Schafers had arranged to stay with their
Australian friends ere the entertainment
committee insisted on taking them in charge.
The gathering at the Oriental Hotel was a
great success. Imported scientists rubbed
shoulders with local doctors and University
profs., and Mrs. Jona, as hostess, had the
afternoon <>f her life.
Lord Frederick Blackwood has gone
away, which is rough on poor little Lady
Frederick, hardly convalescent after her
operation. lie fought in South Africa and
was shot so hard or so often, or something,
that his distinguished Marquis parent rushed
to his bedside to say farewell. However,
nothing very dreadful is likely to happen to
him this time, as he has merely to lie low
and defend England.
Victor 1 food, who has stood in the social
firing-line with so many Governors, is also
off to the front —1 say front advisedly, since
in this war Ihe whole of Europe appears to
be the front, and the only rear that can be
railed a rear is Snitzbergen. My old friend
Humor avers that he intends to ask Kitch-
ener for a job. lie met Kitchener
when he was Private-Secretary to some State
Governor or other, and ex-vice-regal helps
arc well known to be useful War Office
officials.
And, finally, the vast and splendid
Anstruther aide is off as well. He was not
only an aide, but an eligible—a rare com-
bination. The local girls who frequent Gov-
ernment House are desolate.
The Antarctic Mawsons are on their way
to Melbourne. He proposes to lecture there
on the icy district where the chilblains come
from.
Captain Davis, by the way, is being
housed by the Registrar at the University.
For'all his experiences in Antarctica he says
he was never so cold in his life as
on the trip from Adelaide in the wee sraa’
hours of the morning. ITe is very tall, with
a Viking brand of bright gold hair and
beard.
One of the visiting scientists is Roseufeld,
some time of Melbourne, and an authority
on metals. He was chosen months ago to
speak in the Town llall. Melbourne, on
Saturday, August 15, on the “Making of a
Big Gun.” If that lecture isn’t the most
popular of the series it won’t be for lack of
a huge, free advt.
Captain I.andale, who married Miss Vera
Clarke, is rejoining the cavalry regiment
which he left half a dozen years ago. His
sword has been hammered into a shearing-
machine for some time now, but it is being
straightened out, and is expected to look as
good as new when finished. Not so his uni-
form. The sheep industry is one that in-
duces Mesh in many of its votaries, and the
tall, fair pastoralist will never take the
same size in waists again. Also he will need
a stout charger to carry him. When he
went through the Boer war a mere pony
would have sufficed.
Mr. Richmond, who had been soldiering
with the Black Watch before he returned to
the family sheep-run (Haddon Rig. N.SAV.).
is also going back in quest of trouble.
The cause of the hanging fire of the great
battle in Belgium was the fact that the
British force was waiting for Mr. Rich-
mond’s arrival. But if the Germans meanly
attack before he reaches the scene there is
another Richmond son on the spot, likewise
a son-in-law called Gordon Finlayson.
An interesting military wedding of the
hurried order was that of Miss Dolly Clegg
and young Harold Hall, who lately added
many Walter Hall thousands to what his
late parent had already put to his credit.
A couple of army corps of unnatu-
lalised Germans were grabbed one n’ght
last week by the police (mostly the
quarry was run to earth at the turn
Yerein) and requested either to take
i heir oaths that they would not play the
Commonwealth false in any way. or submit
to being- interned during the progress of the
war —“interned” being the international
periphrasis for gaoled or qitodded. *' uum-
her of them decided incontinently to become
British. One who dresses ladies’ hair in a
Coll ins-street shop was locked up for hours
without a drop of lager, while SassicU
women sat furiously waiting for switches,
fronts, bangs and so on. They were just
meditating a reconnaisance in force, with
the idea of retrieving him. when he arrived
parched, and in floods of tears, owing to the
loss of his nationality. It appears the
authorities naturalised him during the night,
lie has not been the same since. . e , 5 -
minds me of Samson after he had liis hair
cut. of Ernest Terah llooley after he tiled
his schedule, and tragic ruins like that.
I was pained in the tenderest part of
my Rule Britannia feelings the other night,
at Spencer’s pictures, to see Queen Mary in
the act of putting up an umbrella. Queens
and gamps don’t go together, somehow.
Many of our own social monarchs, scions
of 50-year-ohl importing houses and 40-year-
old sheep families, beast that they do not
own so much as one personal brolly. Vi hen
it rains they either make the chauffeur shield
them from the elements with his. or they
borrow the gamp of a friend. A passion for the
umbrella appears, by the wav. to he pretty
general in the Royal Family. Princess Mary
is usually depicted carrying one of tlic same
brand as her mother uses, and wielding it.
moreover, in the same resolute and uprigoi
manner. The Medicis loved rubies —the
Guelplis umbrellas, which latter are both
cheaper and more respectable.
May Vale Gilfillan had a, goodly crowd to
see the pictures in her Collins-street studio
last week. Most of May’s sitters appear
to be men. Doctor Alexander Dan-nay was
one of them, and State-Secretary Callaway
—the man who is so interested in gaols—
made another forceful portrait.
The week lias been divided between Science
and War. If by this time I do not know it
all. from the Genesis of Diprodotoiis to the
Campaigns of Alexander, it is not, believe me,
for lack of verbal hints. First in import-
ance, among the gatherings given to discuss
the burning topics of the hour, in the inter-
vals of eating, was the G.-G.’s immense party
on Thursday night. About 2000 people surged
into the ballroom, and another thousand
crowded the drawing-room and picture-
gallery. It was democratic, but not
altogether pleasant. The traffic confu-
sion at the outer gates was awful.
Motor-cars went mad, and cabbies be-
came insane- in the square arranged
for them. Generals in the police force yelled
and danced in their efforts to prevent humble
people who had arrived in trams from being
run over and put out of social action. Arrived
in the ballroom, everyone who was anyone
was promptly lost. In this respect it was
really more like the infernal regions than a
respectable Government House. There were
exceptions, of course. For example, Sir
Oliver Lodge, who is too large and conspicu-
ous to he mislaid anywhere. He stood head
and shoulders above the crowd, and his long
hair obscured the back of his neck like a
silver cascade. However, Sir Edward and
Lady Schiifer were lost almost at once by
Mrs'. Burston, and her cries of despair on the
subject would have moved to pity the heart
of a Uhlan—-one of the sort that commits the
newspaper atrocities when nothing more
authentic is doing. Also, Mrs. Geoffrey
S.vme —conspicuous though she was in an
adorable dress of blue and silver brocade-
got completely off the scent of the Luptons.
One of the A.D.C.’s and I were just hurry-
ing off to the stable to requisition the ser-
vices of the household bloodhound, when a
view-lialloa from the neighborhood of the dais
intimated to us that the quarry had been
run to earth. It was, indeed, a stirring
evening—though, as I said before, somewhat
congested. What it would have been had all
the invited turned up, I tremble to think.
As it was, many of them stayed at home for
various reasons. Mrs. Review of Reviews
Stead had some overseas geniuses staying
with her who lost every fragment of their
luggage. Diana, I fancy it was. who killed
Actseon for seeing her undress. In a similar
spirit Mrs. Stead’s guests announced that
they would see Sir Ronald shot before he
viewed them in undress. Most of the guests
were anxious to see the famous Ferrrr-
gusssson pictures, and the ones that didn’t
care two straws for the pictures felt called
on to. pretend that they did. and so there was
a tremendous rush on the gallery. I got a
splendid view of back-hair, osprey, jewelled
comb and bald head. Also, I saw sonic lovely
tapestries on the walls and a number of
electric lights, which were designed to illumi-
nate the canvases. Then I decided that Life
was sweeter than Art, and got out. It would
he a sound move, in my opinion, to put a
placard at the entrance to the gallery on
future occasions, inscrib’d “No Food Here.”
lending a helping hand to Art -the Art oh War. The
proceeds of lTeinnecke’s concert are to go to the War
Fund, and, a branch of the. Red Cross Society has
been formed. Madame Del mar Hull is arranging for
a big patriotic concert on August 29, and as bands
and orchestras and singers are giving their sendees
free, there should be money in it.
A big University audience did itself honor when it
greeted with specially .warm applause such of the
visiting scientists as were Austrian or German—two
of them are members of the Kaiser's Privy Council.
The crowd simply remembered that these men, its
invited guests, were in a dashed awkward situa-
tion, and they were helped through it generously ; m
return for which the “alien enemies’’ listened to a
lot of “God Save the King” (of England) with
(apparently) profound respect.

One young man, in a wild impulse to *
the supper tables, walked along a 1 « ••
blue-satin-upliolstered sofa which blocked h s
speedy progress. If the looks ot those who
were not active enough to follow his examp c
could have killed, lie would never have tasted

early, and when last observed was putting a
half-nelson on one of the footmen m an
attempt to get somebody else s champa B
from the faithful domestic.
The afternoon party given by the Hennes-
seys in the Town Hall was a smaller and
more restrained affair. The Mayoress pump
handled in a dainty mauve and green silk
frock, topped with a duck of a small baev
hat. Her worshipful partner s furs ana
chains made the lady’s gown look the molt
springlike. The Governor-General snatched
a few minutes to be there, also politicians
by tbe cartload, who seized a chance tor a
little discreet electioneering business.
With almost everybody else bursting with
patriotic demands for funds, the Mayoral
Willises of P’ran are devoting themselves to
local needs. He has raked in £2OOO oit. his
own bat on behalf of the Alfred Hospital.
And a children’s fancy-dress party, which the
pair gave on Friday night, was to help the
epileptics, whose home is inclined to bo over-
looked in the rush. There were 15 or 20
“sets.” and the committee ladies powdered
their hair as a mark of prominence and paid
particular attention to the feeding of the
hungry dancing youngsters. Lady Helen
wore a brilliant red feather in her hat, a
blue dress and a white ruffle. Thus attired
she repaired to the dais, surrounded herself
with the more important dames, and talked
War. T didn’t hear her myself, but you can
safely take the information as from the
stable. These are stirring times when_ there
lives none with soul so dead as to discuss
the weather. Mrs. Alfred Deakin was a
tall, conspicuous presence in black. Gov-
ernor Stanley looked depressed in a sad.
grey tie, like a winter blizzard sweeping
through a slie-oak. He gave a very fair imi-
tation of a leading character at an interment.
What ailed him —whether it was dyspepsia
or the absence of his pretty little wife, who
was home nursing a cold —I was unable to
discover. Food (forgive my insistence on this
theme, but it simply insists in cropping up),
food. T say. was set out in the big council
rooms, with a backwash in the portico bal-
cony, where the red and white blinds were
drawn to screen the feeders from the man
in the street. Congress people came and
went in motored relays—dashing wildly in
for half an hour on their way from Some-
where to Somewhere-else. A band blared
from the balcony.
From “Hosna,” now in London :
Sydney’s musical god-parent, Southwell, is back
from the continent of Europe. When last heard of
he was visiting a Catholic priest in the South of
old Oireland, preparatory to sharing the hearth-
stone of a .Presbyterian minister in the North.
An enormous and striking Will Dyson portrait of
The Bulletin’s old friend Fat is now decorating the
London hoardings, as a poster to advertise the Daily
Herald. the second series of Dyson car-
toons in hook form is selling- like hot cakes, and the
critics are saying the eivilcst possible things about
the Australian artist. The Daily News and Leader
hails him as “a force in contemporary England.”
Why “contemporary” I know not, but it sounds
imposing.
Tiie London Women Journalists’ Society provided
Ihc best Hint to Harassed Housewives T have seen in
(his Mary-Aimless age. They gate themselves a
party..the other day in Dr. Johnson’s old house,
buried among blind alleys at the hack of Fleet-street:
the same having been lent them by Cecil Harmswortli
when he had duly placed a posse of police around
it to keep, off marauding suffragettes. To feed the
hungry notables who came to the revel they did not
go oiit and scour -a barren landscape for extra
waitresses; but hired a bunch of messenger boys from
one of the express:,message companies. These young-
sters. in their neat uniforms and enjoying their own
frightful' importance, handed tea and ices with

From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The Science Congress has come and gone. The
opening engagement of the campaign was at the
Town Hall on Saturday evening, when the delegates
encountered the local Ministry, Both sides com-
ported themselves with courage, though tiie speechify-
ing—which included addresses by the Governor, the
Premier and Sir Oliver Lodge—was deadly in its
precision. Amongst those in the forefront of +he
firing-line were Lady Galway, in gold and blue
brocade; Lady Lodge, in ivory brocade; and Lady-
Butler in a serviceable field dress of grey, with
cloudy drapings of pink ninon. On Monday a
special armored train took the visitors to Aligns on,
where the commissariat arrangements were in the
hands of the Charlie VngaseS. and later on they
motored to the Lindsay Park garden. Meanwhile
scouting expeditions were being flung out in the
direction of the Hills and Milang. Also there was
a two days’ geological foray for some of the party.
On Tuesday Mount Lofty and Mount Pleasant were
carried by assault, the invaders returning to Adelaide
the same day, in time for the Mayor’s reception in
the evening. And on Wednesday a hurried mobilisa-
tion occurred and tiie entire force was transported
to Melbourne. It was brisk work and a credit to
all concerned.
The Mayoral reception was in the Exhibition Build-
ing, transformed for the occasion into an Egyptian
Hall. The supports of the gallery were clothed in
cardboard stencilled with Egyptian designs ; and hang-
ing hessian, also stencilled, hid as much of the walls
and the ordinary paint and gilding as possible. And
then there were electric lights and garlands of
oranges and bunt lies of grapes and a pond fringed with
water lilies, and many other things that one is accus-
tomed to find in the typical Egyptian flail. It only
needed a few unclothed savages howling for back-
sheesh, and about a ton of dust and some (leas and
four or five camels to make it absolutely perfect.
With the Government House party were Major Connor
and Private Secretary Mulholland : Captain Hopwood
having left in nucst of Teuton gore. Moss Cheek,
Mr. Walter W»od, -Mr. Cooper and Mr. Robyns pro-
vided the musical programme, with Mr. Prims as
accompanist; after which there was supper in the
western annex. Everyone was carefully dressed
.eeerdii.g to their lights; so 1 won’t invidiously pick
any me out for special mention, and about 3000 pev-
- ns who have not been definitely discovered in any
really serious offence participated in- the proceedings.
When not assisting Science we hate mostly been
Yours sincerely.

“limner” : A S. M. Herald correspondent
gave an illuminating illustration of the
patriotism of commerce. Ilis son is a
trooper in the Light Horse, receiving from
the Government ss. per parade, to repay
him for the hire of the cat’s-meat. But the
rent of a bueephalus has long been more
than ss. It was 7s. Oil. for some time, but
directly the war scare made parades more
frequent the charge was put up b.v the
horse-owncr to 10s. and 12s. oth. with the
intimation that a modest £8 would be asked
fur 12 days in the event o r the mobilisation
of the beast. And the thing is only a frame-
work with some beef tied on to it.

“^Esculapius”: In ancient Greece they used to
erect temples over natural springs and give to each
a titular dietv. We moderns are no less appreciative
of the healthful virtues of a mineral water —only our
methods differ somewhat. For instance, up at the
famous Helidon Spring, the water is secured just as
it bubbles up from the earth, and hermetically sealed
until the process of aeration and bottling is com-
plete. You don’t need a Greek fineness of palate to
appreciate the cool charm of Helidon Spa—it has
the same delicious refreshingness to Billjim as to the
Earl of Ilopetoun. As a blender with wines and
spirits, too, it gives just that added snap and
sparkle that counts so much in the sum of pleasant-
ness. You’ll be wise to always make it a practice to
“Figaro”: Read a par. here the other week about
Nature planting the giant stinging nettle in N.Q.,
but close beside it the tree whose leaves serve as an
antidote to its sting. This provision of Nature is
in no way unique, for, just as she curses us with
indigestion so she blesses us with Hclidon Spa.
After dining out you’ll have no next morning head-
ache if you take a bottle of “Helidon” before turning
in—this delicious mineral water is Nature’s gift to
those who have dined not wisely but too well. A single
glass will dissolve the undigested food and at the
same time ensure a perfect night’s rest. Quite apart
from its health aspect, “Helidon” greatly enhances
the flavor of wines and spirits—so truly the way of
wisdom is always to
SPLIT IT WITH
HELIDON.
ABORIGIN
ALITIES
“De Oriel”: Had a quaint experience in
the sleepy little town of Wentworth (N.S.W.). Was
in'advance of a company (Howard Bros.). Made a
big show of paper on the old walls and fences that
night. Woke next morning and was amazed to find
that all vestige of my evening’s exertion Had
disappeared. Goats are legion there. I solved the
problem by adding bluestone to the boiled flour. It
killed a few goats but kept the town well and truly
billed.
DIFFERENT CONDITIONS.
BUSHMAN : “I believe you come from down
Sydney side! ”
TEACHER: “Yes, that's correct."
BUSHMAN : “I suppose the Sydney school's a
flasher buildin' than this?”
“Billy T.” : They were discussing the
accident to poor Jock Mackintosh, who had just been
carried in with a broken leg. “I eanna onderstand
hoo it is a bright, carefu’ mon like Meester Mackin-
tosh kirn ta step fra a movin’ train,” said McDougall.
“Ah’m theenkin’ there’s more in yon business than
meets the eye.” “Aye!” responded Saunderson.
“Aye! I happen to ken the poor body caught sight
of a bright wee penny on the track, and he just
steppit off under the confluence o’ oncontrollable
eempulse.” “Ah,” said McDougall; “then it’s reason-
able—verra reasonable.”
“Rufus”: Re the yarn (B. 16/7/T4)
regarding Binglii’s habit of mummifying his defunct
relations. When Dr. Mjoberg, the Swedish scientist,
was in North Queensland last year, he was very
anxious to secure a mummy, but, so far as I can
learn, his efforts were unsuccessful. On one occasion
I accompanied him to a camp where it was known
there was a corpse in process of curing, but we were
not permitted a look inside the preserving room.
The doctor tried to bribe a member of the tribe to
secure the departed, but the said departed's dele-
gates objected. A few days later I happened on a
camp some miles away, and walked unobserved to the
entrance hole of the largest gunyah. I just had a
glimpse of a swathed form suspended over a smoky
fire when I was roughly pushed aside by an excited
buck, and narrowly escaped a crack on the head.
The local tribes say that if a black dies away from
his country, i.e., his birthplace, the body is dried
and carried about by the tribes-folk in their wander-
ings till they arrive at the birthplace. Then the
body is secured in the fork of a big tree, but with-
out its internal machinery, same having been
removed immediately after death. There is no hurry
about the funeral, and the gone-before may be
humped for months before he is finally treed. As
far as I know, the gone-before have never objected to
this.

“Gouger”: A few days ago the Empress of
China took from Cooktown 97 tons of sandal-
wood, worth well over £3OOO. A good deal of
the wood came from the Peninsula and the back
country around Cooktown. Most of it was brought in
during these last two months. The Chinese are
almost the sole buyers of the wood, which they ship
to China. When polished, the Chinese turn it into
beautiful furniture, also into glove and hanky and
jewel cases for the expensive white missy. Yellow
storekeepers at Cooktown are now paying £45 per
ton for the timber, an enormous rise on prices they
have been giving for years. All through the Penin-
sula the miners are dropping the pick and the dyna-
mite and the wild cat, and taking the axe after the
more profitable sandalwood. Teams of every descrip-
tion, from the one-horse waggonette to the big-string
waggons, from the mob of carrying niggers to the
300-horse packs, are scouring the Peninsula
in search of the dirty-looking article for which John
Chinaman is giving his good gold.
“Y.Z.” : It was about 12 o’clock at night
when we found him lying on the Brighton electric
tram track. He was about 30 pints in, and all out.
Henry shook him up. “Le’ me Tone,” he growled.
“You must get out of this, old chap,” said Henry
kindly; “there’s a tram due. You’ll be killed.”
“Don’ be damfool; le’ me Tone. I’m all ri’,” said
the drunk. “But you’re not all right. You are on
the tram rails, and there’s a tram coming.” “Rot!”
snorted the inebriate. “I’m not on tram rails. I’m
perfecly all ri’ ’n’ comfo’ble—l’m in the gutter!”
Argument was useless. lie insisted he was safely,
perfec’ly all ri’ ’n’ comfo’ble—in the gutter!
So we took him by the left leg, and dragged him to
the side of the road, lie was very indignant. lie
expressed the righteous contempt he felt for our
outrageous interference with his liberty, then pawed
round till he found the gutter, and rolling into it
settled down once more while the stream purled
round him. “There,” he said. “Now I’m qui’ safe.
Man’s alwiz qui’ safe in gutter. Wha’ else is gutter
for?” He raised his head and his voice to be more
impressive. “Take away man’s gutter again,” he
said, “sue you for trespass.” So we left him.
The Maoriland system of hooking a dozen
farmhouses on to one telephone wire is a doubtful
sort of blessing. If one subscriber
rings up anyone the whole of the
other subscribers can walk to their
instruments and listen to the conver-
sation if they are inquisitively
inclined. Usually they are. If the
vife rings up the nearest store for
a new hat all the other cats know
it; and if the boss rings up the pub
for a two-gallon keg everybody calls
and helps to drink it. On one com-
munistic line there has been a lot
of trouble lately. A frantic- indi-
vidual has quarrelled with all the
other subscribers, and whenever one
subscriber rings up another he
dashes to his ’phone and delivers
such an assortment of cat-calls, dog
barks and monkey language into
the trembling wire that no one can
use the thing. He seems to sit up
beside the instrument all night, for
no matter when an attempt is made
to use the service the menagerie
breaks loose. Just at present the circuit
is down and out> bl]t the officials are saJd to
be going for the frenzied party with a summons.
f' or an individual like that a summons is not nearly
g 0 convincing as a p i c k-handle.

“He Oriel’’: In a village of pubs and
sugarcane, out from Mackay (Q.), named Finch
Hatton, live a large number of big black beetles. I
will guarantee the sort I mean to be 44in. long and
with nippers 011 them like lobsters. As this pest is
an enemy of the sugarcane, his corpse is worth 9d. a
lb.! Smart men flourish, frequently earning 9s. and
12s. a day.
* * * *
“T. 0.1.” : I’ve come on a new explanation
of the lately-discussed phrase, “Mad as a hatter.”
“Phrases and Names, their Origins and Meanings”
by T. 11. Johnson, 1906, has this: “ ‘Mad as a hatter.’
a corruption of ‘Mad as an after.’ ‘After’ expressed
the Saxon for viper or adder. The word ‘mad’ was
anciently used in the sense of venomous; hence this
expression really meant ‘Venomous as a Viper.’ ”
A MATTER OF ECONOMY.
THE TRAGEDIAN: “The fact is, dear
boy , I can't stand many drinks.”
THE COMEDIAN: “ I believe you. Any-
way, you don't.”
“Nedboc”: Re John Reid’s (B. 80/7/T4)
remark that “Australia has no organised [military]
transport of any kind.” What about this suggestion,
thrown out by the farmers’ official educator in
Bananaland ? ,
Couldn’t the Defence Department do something in
the way of subsidising a motor-truck or waggon?
The War Office does so in England. Indeed, if a
man spends £6OO in buying a motor waggon that
comes up to the specifications of the War Office, he
gets a grant of £llO towards the cost. Why shouldn’t
our Defence Department do something similar? Our
transport corps is notoriously dependent on the
farmers for vehicles. Why not help the farmer to
provide the best possihl. vehicle?
It can’t be done this week, or next, or the week
after; but it seems to me there’s something in the
idea. It would have to be stipulated, of course, that
the vehicle didn’t habitually honk in • the remote
places beyond Birdsville. If it was there it probably
wouldn’t know it was wanted until it was too late
to matter, anyhow.
* # * *
“Lagani-Namo”: The most convincing
warning to trespassers that I’ve happened on to was
at a trading station in the New Hebrides. On each
of the four gate-posts to the compound was a human
skull and thigh bones—the device so popular with
the buccaneers of old. Over these grim ornaments
was written: “Any dogs, pigs or niggers found in-
side this fence will be shot. By order, Jut,ns.” One
day some strange boys ignored the warning and were
promptly given a passage into the Great Beyond.
Jules quietly explained to their angry relatives how
the departed had disregarded his taboo marks; and
the relatives admitted that the punishment was
deserved. Then they bade him a friendly farewell and
scattered for home. At break-o’-day, a week later,
they called on Jules again, murdered him in his
sleep, cooked him with wood from his own fence,
digested him, and finally tied his bones alongside
those at the entrance-way. Incidentally the sign of
the skull and crossbones is used by the Common-
wealth Government at Pennant Hills, N.S.W., above
the warning to the public to keep clear of the wireless
station in certain weather conditions. Some day an
infuriated citizen will call there and eat Joseph Cook.
* * * •
“Boronia”: How far inland has the boom
of a. rough sea raging along the coast been heard?
On clear, calm nights when all the atmospheric con-
ditions were favorable I have heard the hammering
of billows on Cape Leeuwin, a distance of 50 miles.
Let Baron Munchausen or Dictator Joseph Cook stand
forth. [The reference to brothers Munchausen and
Cook is by me, Hermann von Plugge, a patron of
the arts and other liquids.]
“Moana”: It isn’t all Garbage and Nat
Gould in the backblox. Went into a little shanty
in Maoriland miles from .anywhere the other day, and
in 'a rough bookcase in one corner found a small
collection of books that made me stare. Here is the
little list: Keats, Omar, “King Lear,” Green’s “Short
History,” Carlyle’s “French Revolution.” “Marcus
Aurelius,” “The Treasure of the Humble” (Maeter-
linck), “Candida” (Shaw), “Captain Brassbound’s
Conversion” (Shaw), “Life of Gladstone” (Paul),
“Life of Parnell” (O’Brien), Scott’s “Voyage of The
Discovery” (2 vols), “Scott’s Last Expedition”
(2 vols.), “Marie Claire,” “The Contagion of Charac-
ter” (Hillis), “Personal Power” (Thomas), “From
the Cape to Cairo,” four small books by Arnold
Bennett (“How to Live on 24 Hours a Day,” “The
Human Machine,” Literary Taste” and “Mental Effici-
ency”), and one novel, “The Way of All Flesh,” by
Samuel Butler. Not at all a bad little collection of
reading matter to be left alone with. Of course, the
man that owned them was an exceptional sort of
bloke, as blokes go, but still he was a bloke.

A WAR DIRGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Three cheers for the Glorious Game of War,
So ripe with sorrow and red with gore,
And pretty with bright shivoo.
The sides are picked, and the pipers play,
The crowds are crying Hip-hip-hooray,
And the teams look trim as they march away,
Their mission to die or do ;
Whilst many an eye that sees them go
Is shedding a tear of silent woe,
With life to lose, and naught to win
The “Tommy’s” lucky to save his skin
In the Glorious Game. Hooroo!
The umpire’s name it is Gruesome Death:
He blows his whistle with all his breath,
And barraekers get their fill
Of the “sport” the players must now provide:
For the Lord of Hosts (on the stronger side)
In the sacred cause of a Nation’s Pride
Is working His holy will.
The game goes on till call of Time,
When Peace is made and joybells chime.
The side that won, the side that lost,
Must mourn their dead and count the cost —
And Poverty pays the bill.
So wear your colors and spread your chest,
For the play is hot and the match a Test —
Oh ! a glorious game is War.
On land and sea men fight and die,
And bombshells drop from the frowning sky
Like thunder-bolts from the Lord on High
Whom emperors all adore.
The players of every race and creed
Are true-born boys of the Jingo breed,
And a citizen barracker’s chief delight
Is to wave a flag on a noisy night—
The Lord only knows what for.
Australian blood, on the word of Cook.
Shall flow as free as a babbling brook
Ere Britain is brought to shame.
Joe blinks the truth though he speaks aright,
Whilst Britain is fighting a far-off fight
We’ll hold our own, with a grip that’s tight,
In the Empire’s ancient name.
Let Britain’s strength be a British boast:
This land of ours has a wider coast;
With never a man or a ship to spare.
On behalf of our kinsmen over there,
We sing “Save the King” as we now prepare
To play a defensive game.
VICTORIA.

FRUIT LAXATIVE FOR MAMMA, DAD,
BABY, “CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.”
Better than calomel, oil or pills to clean
and regulate liver, bowels and
ctomach.
Mother, daddy and the children can always
keep feeling fine by taking this delicious
fruit laxative as occasion demands. Nothing
else cleanses the stomach, liver and bowels
so thoroughly without griping.
You take a little at night and in thj morn-
ing all the foul, constipated waste, sour bile
and fermenting food delayed in the boAvels
gently moves out of the system. When you
awaken all headache, indigestion, sourness,
fold taste, bad breath, fever and dizziness
are gone ; your stomach is sweet, liver and
bowels clean, and you feel grand.
“California Syrup of Figs'’ is a family
laxative. Everyone from grandpa to baby
can safely take it, and no one is ever disap-
pointed in its pleasant action. Millions of
mothers know that it is the ideal laxative
to give cross, feverish children. Ask your
chemist for a bottle of “California Syrup of
Figs,” which has directions for babies, chil-
dren of all ages, and for grown-ups plainly
on the bottle. Remember there are counter-
feits sold here, so look and see that your
bottle bears the name of “California ‘Fm
Syrup Company.” Hand back with contempt
any other tig syrup. “California Syrup of
Figs” is sold by all leading chemists, 1/11
and 1/9. ' . / ?

OVER THE CORDUROY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There are some who travel on well-made roads
And sit in a motor-car,
AVith rugs and cushions to keep them warm
As they spin to a town afar,
And some pay well for the rides they take,
While others steal rides of joy ;
But we of the bushlands jar and jolt
Over the corduroy ;
AA r e thump and jump with many a bump
Over the corduroy.
There are some who drive their mettlesome steeds
And sit in their landaus smart;
But we have only a tired old nag
And ride in a creaking cart
Along the gullies and round the hills,
While the swarming flies annoy;
It's a weary trip for man and nag
Over the corduroy,
And it’s oh for the rack of an aching back,
Over the corduroy.
There are some who stick to the railway tracks,
A “first return” they buy,
AVhile others go up in an aeroplane,
And wing their way to the sky ;
But we who live in the bush afar
Must humbler means employ,
So we bump along in a worn old cart,
Over the corduroy,
With a jar and a jolt that loosens each bolt,
Over the corduroy;
AVith a jump and a thump and a bump, bump, bump,
Over the corduroy.

O’PIIIMERTY.
“Y.Z.”: I had been invited to spend a
pleasant Sunday evening at Flohm’s. The Cohens
were there, and the Blooms, and the Tleinsteins;
also Mr. and Mrs. Yaeobs, and four persons named
Moses. 1 think they were Jewish, too. We played
cards mostly, but my interest was centred in old
Mr. Flohm, the father of our host, a patriarchal
gent who looked like Moses out of his bed quilt, and
who had a nose that snuggled down in his whiskers
like a bird in its nest. Flohm, senior, did not play
cards. He had a piece of pencil, and employed him-
self making marks on anything and everything. When
Flohm took the paper from him he made marks on
Bloom’s collar. Every now and again Mrs. Flohm
would whisper: “Issatore, dere is fadder ad id again.
Sdop him, vill you ?” Flohm would stop his ancient
sire ; but presently the old man was as busy as ever,
making marks on what cards he could sneak, on the
wallpaper, on the woodwork—anywhere. - I investi-
gated later. The mark Flohm the elder was making
was this “£.” I found the walls literally covered
with it to a height of seven feet. Flohm’s. outhouses,
his asphalt and his back fences are thickly orna-
mented with the magic sign. “Vot, aind’t de poor
olt shendleman right in hiss mindt ?” asked Bloom.
“Righd in hiss mindt?” squealed Issadore indignantly.
“Of gourse, he’s righd in hiss mindt. Can’d der
fadder haff some innocend amusemends? Vot he
tinks is dot he is sdill making money hand-oafer-fist.
Righd in hiss mindt! Righd in hiss mindt! Veil, I
neffer see such tarn impudence!”
THE TARIFF RAIL-SITTER—

“Moana” : Although the fact is not gener-
ally known, the Maoriland tui, or parson bird, is
one of the best talkers in feathers on this planet.
The average parrot is an also-started alongside of
him. Its wowser name was given it because it
is quite black save for a white plume underneath the
throat that sticks out and looks like a parson’s little
white tie. I know of a tui that an Auckland man
had, which learnt lengthy sentences and picked up
many scraps of stray talk not intended for its ears.
Its enunciation was remarkably clear, and it invari-
ably used the exact tone of voice employed by the
person whose words it was repeating. But it never
learned to write and its cheque was no good at the
Bank of Ohinemutu.
THE REVERSE.
BIOBBS : “I hear it's a fact you are unable to meet your creditors .”
DOBBS: “Far from it, dear boy , far from it. I seem to meet the brutes everywhere .
“0.H.5.”: Arrived at Port Moresby last
Saturday, and one of the first objects that met my
eye was a white nigger. In formation his features
are exactly the same as any other native, but his
skin is quite white and his hair quite fair. The
oldest inhabitant told me that he (the bleached nig)
was born of parents as black as the outlook in
Europe, and was simply a freak of Nature.
* - •* ' * *
“F.H.R.”: Was asked by an old battler
t’other day if I knew of any work. I told him of a
bit of fencing on the tops that should suit him ; good
sinking and soft, and plenty of timber handy. “Any
bees-nests he asked. I told him that it was rather
cold for bees up there. “No good ter me,” he says.
“Why, what’s a man going to eat with his damper?”
'these old battlers never dream of buying butter or
jam.
* * * *-
“Wyangarie” : Surely it is about lime that
our Forestry Department began to take reafforestation
seriously. At present it’s only policy seems to be
the collecting of royalty. Writer knows one forest
reserve, no great exception either, on the North Coast
(N.S.W.). three miles from a deep-sea port, with
hardly a suitable tree for milling purposes on it.
If the reserves of this description were felled and
burnt, thousands of seedlings would take the place
of the present useless and ant-ridden timber. With
a little discriminate thinning out in the early stages
of growth, Nature would accomplish the rest; and in
30 or 40 years the State would have a fine forest and,
incidentally, a big commercial asset. Anyone familiar
with the hardwood forests of the North Coast can
have ocular proofs of this in the areas felled by the
early selectors. Some of these were abandoned, and
are now covered by healthy trees, which if pro-
tected for a few years from the timber-destroying
mania of the settlers would be fit for the sawmill.

“Mrs. Lance Itawson”; His Gaiters of
Papua can have his native “converts” for- me. I
know them —have known them since the ’Bo’s. As
far back as that time there was a mission station
on Fraser’s Island, and the “converts” were its
joy and pride. One time the rations gave out and
the blacks deserted and came over to us on the
mainland, to steal and fight, loaf and drink (when
they could). They were given to standing at the
street corners in Maryborough and repeating the
Lord’s Prayer and the Ten Commandments for
sickapence: “You gib it sickapence, I say Lord's
Player, I say it Cleed [Creed], I say it Command-
ments,” was their way of drawing a crowd and
taking up a collection. When asked why they didn’t
return to the Mission, the reply generally was: “Him
got no more beef, no more phflour—me no wantem
Jesus Chlist.” Black Brother is not a Mission hoy
from inclination. He’d be anything while the tucker
lasted.

I don’t believe that because aborigines become
civilised and live ill houses they will die rapidly.
It is the chopping and changing' about that reduces
the numbers. The native lives, in a cottage for a
while, but suddenly hears-the call of the wild, and
goes out and makes a camp in the bush. If he
stuck to either the wurlie or the cottage he would
be all right, but shifting from one to the other brings
on pneumonia. It Would be far better for the full--
bloods if they Were working in a city, They Would
have so many things to see find think about that their
hereditary instincts would Weaken. To put them in
a mission station that is surrounded by the bush is
like placing a chicken in reach of a tame fox. A
black will Want to camp in the bush at some time
or other, and the chopping and changing in this
condition of life will bring on lung trouble. The
common ailments at the mission station are colds,
bronchitis, pneumonia and indigestion.
FAME.

Andy’s Quid.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Til IS likely yeh didn’ know Boghole,” said
JL Quinu —“a shmall biv iv a place ’tween
Tim’s Crick V Mollywell, here in Bungaree. ’Twill
be seven year or more since I was lasht there,
attindin’ the winther meetin’, whin I met wid Andy
Looney. Boghole, I’m Cellin' yeh, is mostly inhabit

predominit, consequence iv the Looneys havin’ more
male childer than faymale, V marrvin’ thivn iv the

most terrible.
“Andy Looney was then a giant iv a

great weight V eireumf’fence. Yid not see a
thicker head in a million than Andy's, V the face iv
him was like a larrge melon, bit ’n' twist wid the
frost. Andy had grown wid such velocity 'twas im-
possible fer his throwsers t' overtake him, V his
vveskit would be a year late ever, ’n‘ the coat he’d
wear would look impossible t’ git on, ’n' improbable
t’ get off, barrin’ miracles.

down his pound-note. ’N’ ‘that’s the wan!' sez he,

Mr. Public House is the latest person to
be threatened with industrial trouble in N.
S. Wales. The position is about as tangled
as a serpent in a fit. The Ma .State’s pub
servitors were originally organised by the
Hotel, Club and Restaurant Employees’
Union. This body obtained a regulation of
conditions through the Industrial Court.
There are, however, rival organisations, one
of which is the Federated Liquor Trades
Employees’ Union. As a preliminary to
taking matters before the Commonwealth
Arbitration Court, the Federated Beer Union
secured a compulsory conference with the
employers in the various States; but Mr.
Public House of N.S.W. refused to come to
any agreement, holding that the award ob-
tained in the State by the Hotel, Club and
Restaurant Employees’ organisation made
further action unnecessary. Now the fede-
rated union has a considerable membership,
and is. threatening industrial battle. A
strike is not feasible; so the Federal Union
threatens to take its agreement to the hotel
licensees individually, and ask them to sign.
Those that refuse it proposes to put on a
black list, and it hopes to get the Labor
Council to declare a boycott against their
beer-pumps. If Mr. Public House in
general is obdurate, the Union will try an
agitation to have all beer pumps brought
under the early closing law. The Union is
taking . a lot for granted, for its success
with either the State Government or the
Labor Council is doubtful; nevertheless Syd-
ney may yet see rival Messrs. Pub waving
different badges of “whiteness,” given by
rival . organisations, while the puzzled
unionist will try to worry out which beer
really is black and bad. He will probably
wind up by deciding that all beer is amber,
and there is none that isn’t good on a hot
day. Between drinks, if he is wise, he will
decide that, since the Commonwealth con-
trols the tariff, and the tariff and wages are
inextricable, the sooner the whole business
of fixing wages, etc., is passed over to the
Commonwealth the better.
Au ancient Maori woman died the other
day at Orakei (M.L.). She was declared
to be one of the tribe that, in 1840, sold to
Captain Hobson the land on which the city
of Auckland now stands. Presumably there
was a person named Hobson. Her name
was Katene Rewiti and she was alleged to
be about 101 years old. The alleging party
is at large, but his address is obscure and
fleeting.
“B. J.”: Are there any other bishness
men who treat their clients in the habitu-
ally arrogant manner of some of the chiefs
of the amusement industry hereabouts? Not
even patent-medicine vendors more con-
sistently misrepresent the quality of their
goods. Even if the theatrical man carries
out his contract, more or less, in regard to
the seat which he has sold, he may still, if
he. feels that way, give an entertainment
quite different from the one his clients have
paid to see. For instance, a change of
programme was announced for the Thurs-
day of Lauder’s last week in Melbourne,
but only one of the seven new items adver-
tised came to pass; so that those who had
come to listen to new stuff, having paid
their money, took the management’s choice.
What would be the position of a publisher
who put the letterpress of a July magazine
in an August cover and sold the thing as
the latest issue?
Condensed yarn of the Genteel Landlady:
She said she was just having her afternoon nap.
Or was it nip?
Anyway, her house wasn’t like some she could
name. She wasn’t a Colonial herself. She took
only the best class of boarders, and took them for a
pastime, her husband being the head of a State
department, and having considerable means. Never
any unpleasantness here, no irregular payments, no
late hours, no drink, and none of this familiarity.
“And don’t you let them get familiar, either.
There’s a young girl here—but you’ll find out for
yourself.
“Now, see this room here, Kid. A young actor
has it. It’s a bit untidy now. He says to me the
other day, ‘When are you going to clean my room
out, Nell?’ I says, ‘When are you going to pay
me?’ Ah, you don’t know them.
“Wait till I tell you about the two sports in
the top room. I won’t have no bad language or
carrying on in my house, and I told them so one
night last week. Two o’clock it was; and, look, Kid,
they oidy laughed and says, ‘Come on and have a
drink, missis.’ And me that doesn’t touch it, and
neither does my husband.
“I set my teeth, and I says, ‘By the living Gawd,
you’ll clear out of this damn house to-night, or
I’ll get the traps in.’ I came down, got on my
clothes, got the revolver, and went into the young-
actor’s room. He was just getting into bed, and I
says, ‘Will you stand by me as a man?’ Well, I
went upstairs again, and I says, ‘Now, then, out of
this, you rotten mongrels, or, by the living Cheddar,
I’ll shoot you dead where you stand.’
“And just then if the boss didn’t come home, and
he’d had a fair drop, and between the mob of
them things was lively. But they didn’t know me,
son. When my blood’s up, and I have a drop of
drink in, I’ll fight-t-t. I let off that revolver; and
when they took it from me —the d—n cowards—l
up with a beer bottle and smashed the lamp to
smithereens. And the d—n curtains blazed up
and ■
“Oh, I see; too far from the city. Well, you
know best, Kid.”
The query of the moment: What sort of
a picnic would Cook and the other Dread-
nougliters have had if to-day’s war cloud had
blown across the European sky four years
ago!
[F. C. Jones., Elgar-road, Burwood, Vic.]
Great are the Fishers among men. It
was one, Andrew, who gave us that Aus-
tralian fleet for which now we sleep more
soundly o’ nights; it was another, Johu,
who, in the face of other fierce opposition,
insisted on the concentration of Britain’s
naval strength in the North Sea.
“Westerner” : Attorney-General Tommy
Walker, of Westralia, who has been in the
limelight lately, was for some years a familiar
figure on the Inky Way. lie edited Perth
Sunday Times (which paper is now fiercely
attacking him), and afterwards moved on to
Kalgoorlie to take John Drayton’s place as
chief charioteer of the Sun. Between whiles
he launched a sensational journal of his own
(Perth Sunday Press), but piled it up on
the rocks. Tommy is a brilliant speaker,
but a dull and diffuse writer, with a style
as stodgy as cold porridge. His journalistic
recipe was to mix an ounce of fact with a
ton of verbiage. If he had to record the fact
that Bill Jones was before the beak charged
with being drunk and disorderly, he would
start out by recounting the glorious “burst”
with which Noah celebrated the grounding
of the Ark ; quote the story of Dot and his
daughters ; look in at the marriage at Cana
in Galilee; glance at the “banquet” of Plato,
the solitary repasts of Lucullus and the orgies
of Nero and Heliogabalus ; and after filling
a column with the names of famous “tanks,”
ancient and modern, would flop down to the
lame conclusion that Bill Jones was fined
10s. The outstanding feature of his editor-
ship of the Sunday Times was a libel action
brought against the paper by a parson named
Price, whom Tommy had accused of illicit
housemaid. The information came from the
girl herself; bfit on examination her story
resolved itself into the same old imaginative
yarn, and the narson collected damages.
Among many other things in his varied
career, Walker was for years a Freethought
lecturer. He once showed the present writer
his library of controversial works —Tom
Paine, Bradlaugh, Ingersoll, G. W. Foote
and the rest. On the writer remarking how
dead these old controversies were, Tommy
threw out his chest and exclaimed: “Do
you want to know why? It’s because we
have won the day!” And from the pride
with which he spoke, it was easy to see that
he believed he was entitled to no small share
in the honor and glory of the victory.
In these days the big Broken Hill Prop.
Co. is a mixed grill. The chairman, Hugo
Carl Emil Muecke. has long been the Ger-
man Consul for South Aus. The general
manager. Guillaume Daniel Delprat, is Con-
sul for Holland in Adelaide. If these two
settle their international differences in the
usual manner there will be a Dutch victory
in the first round. David Baker, the man-
ager of the iron and steel works at New-
castle, is ’Murikan, of course; and
equally, of course, the chief engineer.
Lindsay, is Scotch. The Broken Hill
manager, Horwood, is Australian —a Ben-
digo boy 30 years ago, trained for
a start at the Melbourne Uni.’s Engi-
neering School. Apart from Muecke,
the Board almost without exception takes
parritch for its breakfast, and has been like
that for 25 years.
C. 11. Bertie, the Sydney Municipal
Librarian, is advocating the establishment
of a Museum, distinct from the general
Museum, for the preservation of curios con-
nected with the city. He suggests that Vau-
cluse House, the old home of the Wentworths,
now public property, would be a suitable
place for the glorified waxworks show. A
hundred years ago this Vaucluse was the
home of Henry Brown Hayes, the titled
gentleman who had abducted a Cork quaker-
ess, Miss Pike, and got a life sentence for it.
He, by the way, after receiving his speedy
pardon, established the first Masonic Lodge
in Sydney.
From “Rosna,” in London: —-
AVe have just erected a statue of Captain Cook;
and as it is only 144 years since the useful sailor
acquired the best country on earth for us, this seems
precipitate. However, we made up our minds to it
with the celerity of lightning in exactly six years,
on the strength of a letter from Joe Carruthers, of
N.S.W., who pointed out what would have hap-
pened if Captain Cook had never landed there, etc.
The statue is in bronze, and is on the wrong side
of the Admiralty Arch, where no one will be in
danger of meeting it unawares. Prince Arthur of
Connaught was employed to disrobe it —the Con-
naughts being much in demand for Dominion jobs
of this kind. The usual busy people looked on,
guarded by the party of Australian cadets who are
here, to study the ways of the army. A great grand-
nephew of the captain, one F. W. Kealey, was also
present to show his gratitude at this swift appre-
ciation of the services of his ancestor.
How to be Beautiful.
By RITA MOYA.
It Is not every woman’s good fortune to be endowed by Nature with fine features and
a flawless complexion, but nowadays it is possible to make the plainest fade attractive, and
that too in the privacy of one’s home, without recourse to beauty specialists, which usually
involve expensive treatments and much loss of time. I shall endeavor to show you in the
following lines how much may be done in this direction bv any woman of ordinary intelli-
gence. When facial applications are necessary, use only the pure ingredients just as they
come to the chemist himself. Do not allow yourself to be persuaded into buying some
cheap, ready-made preparation instead. Any chemist will gladly obtain the original con-
centrated ingredients for you, if you insist, and although he may not have them in stock,
you will be well advised to wait while be orders them for you. The improvement in your
appearance will be ample compensation for any trouble taken to obtain these simple and
harmless beautifiers.
Beauty in Breathing.—A great deal can be
done towards brightening the eyes by system-
atic breathing for 10 minutes each morning
and evening. Breathe slowly and deeply to
the fullest capacity of the lungs. You should
stand erect by an onon window. The corsets
should not be worn during this exercise.
About Shampooing.—Even the best shampoo
is somewhat drying, and if the hair is not
naturally oily I suggest that just before the
shampoo you apply olive oil to the scalp, rub-
bing it into the hair roots vigorously. Then
use pure stallax for the shampoo. Dissolve a
leaspoonful in a cup of hot water. This will
leave the hair very clean, soft and fluffy.
An Instantaneous Beautifler. —Instead of face
powder, use a simple lotion made from one
ounce of cleminite and four teaspoonfuls of
water. This lotion will tone and clear the
skin, and acts as a protection against sun and
wind. A little applied with the finger-tips
instantly gives the skin a delightful “bloomy”
appearance. No powder is necessary, and the
result lasts ail day long under the most try-
ing conditions.
To Permanently Remove Superfluous Hair.—
It is a simple matter to remove a downy
growth of hair temporarily, but to remove it
permanently is quite another matter. It is a
pity that it is not more generally known that
powdered pheminol may be used for this pur-
pose. Apply it directly to the hair. The
''’'•’"ended treatment is designed not merely
to instantly remove the hair, but also to event-
ually kill the roots entirely. Any chemist
should be able to- supply you with an ounce
of pheminol, which quantity should be suffi-
cient.
The Real Cause of Most Bad Complexions.—
It is an accepted fact that no truly beautiful
•oinplexion ever came out of jars and bottles,
and the longer one uses cosmetics the worse
the complexion becomes. Skin, to be healthy,
must breathe. It also must expel, through the
pores, its share of the body’s effete material.
Creams and powders clog the pores, in-
terfering both with elimination and breathing.
If more women understood this there would
be fewer self-ruined complexions. If they
would use ordinary mercolised wax instead of
cosmetics they would have natural, healthy
complexions. This remarkable substance is
not absorbed by the skin; its action is just
the opposite. The skin repels mercolised wax,
and at the same time throws off all imperfec-
tions. An exquisite new complexion peeps
out. quite free from any appearance of artifi-
ciality. Apply nightly, like cold cream, for a
week or two, washing it off in the morning.
About Hair Tonics. —Each week almost one
hears of some wonderful discovery for im-
proving the hair, and although this paragraph
may seem a little superfluous, an old-fashioned
recipe may coim as a welcome change. One
thing about it is that it will grow hair, and
also prevent it falling out. From your chem-
ist get an original package of boranium, to
this add I-pint of bay rum, allow it to stand
SO minutes, then add sufficient water to make
half a pint. Rub briskly into the scalp with
the flnsrer-tips and you will immediately ex-
perience that clean, tingling sensation which
is a sure sign of healthy action. [2

At Echuca '’Vic.) the loyal multitude has virtu-
ously refused to drink German beer.
Ah, brethren, this is war indeed,
Insatiable hate!
There many are who’ll gladly bleed
For home and country and for creed,
But few, I dare to state,
Who nobly for their country dear
Will turn their backs on any beer.
In fair Echuca now-a-night
It is not safe to go
Around the town extremely tight,
Unless prepared to make it right,
And definitely show
The drink that put you on your ear
Is French or Dutch or British beer!
In this emergency a pi .n
Echuca’s hit upon.
There every upright British man
Drinks all the English beer he can,
And when the booze is gone
His loyalty to manifest
He sticks the labels on his chest!

LITTLE VERSES OF WAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Red glows the forge with the fires of hate ;
Loud rings the anvil ’neath the hammer-strokes
of War,
Ho! for the blacksmith welding fast a State 1
Bui the bright sparks perish on the cold, black
floor !
The Kaiser’s Promise:
He said the Belgian lands would smile—
Or' so the story runs;
But every dreadful shattered mile
They looked in vain to see it smile.
It only grinned with guns!
Song of the German Soldier Besieging Liege:
Why should I march to Death
When Death is close behind?
The frontier guns’ hot breath
Has our own trenches lined
With shattered comrades who
Will nevermore draw breath.
Now Russia’s breaking through,
Why should I march to Death?
Why should I march to Death
When Death behind me comes?
I feel his charger’s breath -
I hear his rolling drums!
For those behind I pray
With every sobbing breath!
My Emperor ! Oh, say,
Why must I march to Death?

There’s a Life-Saving Power about
I
HEARNE’S
Bronchitis Cure
that raises this remedy right out
of the Ruck. Read this and reflect s
“When my little girl was 3 years old, she contracted
upon which supervened Bronchitis, Pneu-
monia and Congestion of the Lungs. She was attended
by a Doctor of high standing whose treatment however
“was not successful. On Saturday, 21st October, he
said that her life was in danger—that there was very
little hope for her. For eight days and nights she had
“ been prostrated with Cough, Pain and Fever, and
‘‘was lying like a statue, Unconscious. At this
stage, I was persuaded by a friend to obtain
“Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, with its auxili-
ary medicine for the Fever and Congestion of
the Lungs, as directed in the Catalogue
of Medicines which accompanies each
bottle of the Bronchitis Cure. I gave the
Medicine as directed, and there was an
‘ improvement from the First Dose
“of Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
The improvement continued
“steadily after each dose of the
“Medicine. In a week she was
“perfectly free from the Pneu-
monia, Congestion, Cough, Pain
‘‘and Fever, and was well, except
“that she was still weak. In a fort-
night she was quite Recovered,
“and is now in splendid health and
“Stronger than ever. It Abso-
lutely Snatched my Child

gradation and fineness of grain—are consistently uniform and dependable.
It’s a “Sun” Plate you need.
They are made in Australia, and are, therefore, perfectly fresh. Obtainable

PRACTICAL PRESCRIPTION AGAINST
STOMACH ACIDITY.
BY A SPECIALIST.
“Nine-tenths of all eases of stomach
trouble nowadays,” says a leading specialist,
“are caused by too much acid. In the begin-
ning the stomach itself is not diseased, but if
this acid condition is allowed to continue the
acid is very likely to eat into the stomach
walls and produce stomach ulcer or cancer,
either of which may render a radical surgical;
operation necessary, even to prolong life..
Therefore an ‘acid stomach’ is really a dan- 1
•gerous condition, and should be treated seri-
ously. It is utterly useless to take pepsin'
and ordinary stomach tablets. The excess
acid must be neutralised by the administra-;
tion of an efficient antacid. For this pur-
pose physicians nearly always recommend'
taking half a teaspoonful of bisurated mag-
nesia in a littld water after each meal.
Larger quantities may be used if necessary, 1
as it is absolutely harmless.. But be sure to:
get the bisurated magnesia, as other forms
of magnesia have not the same action in the
stomach as the bisurated, and frequently do]
more‘harm than good.”*
A Simple Recipe for Clearing
the Complexion.
Exposure to hot winds and sun makes the
nerves and muscles of the face tired and life-
less, and the skin shrivelled, wrinkled and
unhealthy.
If anyone with a sallow, blotchy, wrinkled
or pimply complexion will only take a little
trouble in following the directions here given
they will find a marvellous improvement in
their complexion. Get some Puritol Wax
from the chemist or draper, and apply at
night, washing off in the morning with warm
water and soap. Then lap a little cold
water 10 times upon the face with the hands,
allowing it to get thoroughly round the
closed eyes. The treatment should be fol-
lowed out in every detail to ensure success,
and undoubtedly accounts for many of the
clear complexions so much admired by those
who do not yet know the secret. See that
you get the right kind, it will not injure the
most delicate complexion.*
THE HOWARD: Exact.
T n 1829 Edward Howard was apprenticed to
Aaron Willard, Jun., the descendant of a long
line of English Watchmakers, who settled in the
Massachusetts Colony about the middle of the
eighteenth century.
In 1840 he started in business for himself. Up
to that time watches had always been made by
handwork exclusively. Howard’s plan was to
make automatic tools that should perfect the
parts of a watch, leaving to the hand the task of
assembling and finishing the parts.
In 1842 the first Howard Watch was produced
—a thoroughly practical watch. The Howard of
to-day is the finest practical timepiece in the
world for a man to carry in his pocket.
It has a patented hard-tempered steel balance,
which will not knock out of true with the jolt
and jar of the severest service.
Peary carried a Howard on his trip to the
Pole.
Orville Wright relied on a Howard in his Aero-
plane Tests.
Admiral Chas. D. Sigsbee carried a Howard for
forty years.

THE NEED OF CALM PRE-

'Midst the whooping of war news the daily papers
find time’only to rebuke Australia for daring to
want a Parliament at such a time, etc., etc.
Ci.ara Catchpenny : “Hi! Europe ablaze !

From Teesdale Smith, regarding o bother-
some railway contract: —
I regret 1 have no time this week to reply in
detail to Randolph Bedford’s remarks (B. O/8/’lI).
i want now merely to suggest to him to invest in a
Castles machine and take on the contract for the
construction of the East-West line from 122 miles to
260 miles. As Mr. Bedford is quite satisfied that
the machine would do the work for something under
3d. —and. allowing a third more for supervision and
repairs, making a total of Id.—he will be able to
get a return of 1200 or 1300 per cent.; and if he
makes up a little syndicate of Messrs. Bamford,
Gardiner and Rae, with himself as general super-
visor, it will net be necessary for him to take my
thousand, which can be left for dissatisfied Senators.
1 shall be glad if this letter can be shown Mr. Bed-
ford this week, as tenders close on the 18th inst.
There is one infuriated elector in a Mel-
bourne suburb who has an objection all his
ovvn to Andy Fisher’s proposed pension for
widows. He attends every meeting. lie
asks every Senate and Rep. candidate the
same question : “Are you in favor of pension
for widows?” Receiving a reply in the
affirmative, his feelings overpower him, and
he speaks out: “It’s a bonus fer manslorter,
tlia’s what it is. You orter know better.

[Edward Dyson, St. Kilda, Vic.]
“Liberalism” is again waving the Rural
Workers’ log in the face of the gentle agri-
culturist, and urging him to save himself
by voting the Fusion ticket. The Argus
publishes the log and asks the farmer how
lie will like that, although it knows very
well that, if the log goes before the Arbitra-
tion Court, reductions are bound to be made
—just as they were made in the journalists'
log, otherwise the Argus would be paying
senior reporters £9 a week, instead of £7.
Moreover, in this matter, it will make no
difference to the farmer which party is
returned, since neither has offered to amend
the Arbitration Act so as to prevent the
rural workers going before the Court.
[B. J. H. Owen, 108 Albert-street, East Melbourne.]
Defence Minister Milieu :
One of the greatest difficulties in equipping the
expeditionary force is that of providing the large
number of horses required. The difficulty arises, not
from any shortage of horses in Australia, but from
the necessity of procuring them in the very limited
time that is available. The kind most urgent] v
needed are gunners’ and draught horses, which should
all be broken.
With stud farms in various parts of this
continent, the defence authorities would
have been able to supply their needs simply
by wiring the farm-managers, instructing
them to send the required number of trained
animals of various classes to port without
delay—quite a different proceeding from
scouring the country for more or less un-
trained animals, with a time-limit which
may mean the acceptance of animals that
would not be passed otherwise. Presumably,
as the Minister now knows the “difficulty,”
Australia will, make a start at. stud-farm-
ing forthwith. A second “difficulty” may
not be as successfully climbed over as the
present one has been.
[Frank llenty, Glen Iris, Victoria.]
One of the few interesting election fights
is taking place in Wentworth (N.S.W.),
where Labor-man Robert Cruickshank is
giving Kelly some anxious moments. Cruick-
shank is a. journalist, who also knows the
advertising side of the business, a, good
speaker and an experienced campaigner. He
long fought with Drake, the Federal Attor-
ney-General, on the White Australia side in
Queensland. At the last State elections
Labor won on the second ballot in Waverley,
and only missed Woollahra by a whisker or
so;, and since then the Laborites reckon that
their vote has been so augmented in Padding-
ton, Woollahra and Waverley that Kelly's
margin will be wiped clean out.
[Harold Mercer, Katoomba, N.S.W.]
If by chance the big armies—German on
one side and Belgian, French and British
on the other—fight one stupendous battle
instead of a number of small engagements,
that shock will be the biggest thing of its
kind in history, so far as concerns the num-
bers engaged. The record battle up to date
is Liao Yang. Chalons, with Aetius, the
Roman, in command, comes next. Certainly
there, are wild and awful conflicts in the
Book of Mormon, showing how God went
to America in the time before Moses, and
24,000,000 Americans —more or less —were
induced to do battle, and everybody was
killed save one, and his name was Jones, or
Briggs or something of the sort. But the
best authorities on fortification have doubts
about that battle which, according to the
Prophet _ Smith,- happened when God went
to America.
An appeal that this country should keep
on. buying British goods, and thus
help the Ma Country, reached here
last week. About the same moment a
number of the smaller Australian news-
papers, which carry limited supplies of raw
material, applied to British agents in this
country for paper. They tyere told that
supplies were low. They cjabled to Eng-
land, and learned that Belgian and French
and German paper mills being practically
closed, English supplies were also low. The
Ma Country, it seems, is well off for grind-
stones and dried cod. but that doesn’t greatly
help the newspaper man.
The State Governments, whose foreign
borrowings have been a scapdal. are now
putting a brave face on things and declaring
that, though foreign loans must necessarily
cease for a while, the finances couldn’t be
better. So the inference is that the borrow-
ing was quite needless, and that Holman
has been pawning the country for a jest,
and Scaddan lias been selling posterity into
financial bondage out of pure wickedness.
Australia is beginning to got a proper
view of the value of the bygone Fisher
Government. In the days when the Oppo-
... . ~ , , , , ~ “Hnnnt
sition talked at random about a tmpot
Australian fleet and a conscript army,
Andrew Fisher and his party pushed on
with the details of the national defence
scheme. Had the Liberals been on deck
and put their own alleged principles into
practice we would have liad no army, no
great battle cruiser, no small-arms factory,
no Commonwealth notes to ease the strain
on the gold reserves. Truly, the gold reserves
were never strained, hut they might have
been had that German army rolled through
Belgium like a wave, and the High Seas
Fleet swept the British First Battle Squad-
ron off the top of the North Sea. Fisher
is a man who lias done a heap of things,
Cook is a politician who merely sits on
that heap and asks Australia how it thinks
it could possibly manage without him. He
is the noisy fowl that cackles after another
lien lias laid the egg.
[G. A. Jeffries, 214 George-street, Sydney.]
IN THE COUNTRY OR MARY WARS.
PROUD GERMAN SON : “Fader, I am ordered to der front.”
PROUD GERMAN FATHER: “Yah, but which front is dot?”
A timber company which had applied to
the Tariff Commission for an increase of
duty on dressed timbers came along the
other day and wanted to withdraw the appli-
cation. It foolishly explained why: It
thought of closing down its mils in Aus-
tralia, and having its timber cut in Siberia,
where labor was cheaper. Which means, of
course, that the present duty is not sufficient
to protect the high-wage Australian workman
from the.cheap labor of the Russian ; where-
fore what was an Australian industry is
likely to become a Siberiap business. The
change will make little difference to the
co., which will still get its profits; but it
will mean a lot to the workmen who will lose
their jobs. Apparently the co. forgot that
the Commission might be more or less in-
terested in the workman.
[Harold Mercer, Katoomba, N.S.W.]
“Had Joseph Chamberlain retained his
health and strength lie would have driven

the unbunecl corpse that is still permitted

From “Croson”: The war has at least
taught our Tory-minded State Premiers the
practicability of regulating prices. Faced
with the cornering of necessaries 'by ultra-
loyal wholesalers, the said Premiers at once
discovered that the alleged ‘'impossible in-
terference with trade” was quite feasible,
All they had to do was to follow the lead
0 f Westralia, which penalises any person
who sells food-stuffs over and above any
required for his owu personal consumption
—at a price higher than that fixed by a
commission. And they promptly did so.
It will be handy by-and-bye to remember
that the “hasty legislation” thus initiated
may not only be continued hut extended,
so that the prices, not of food-stuffs only,
but of other commodities, may be fixed by
law.
“F.H.” : The Australian Freedom Leagi
in Melbourne has its own quaint ideas aboi
the right moment to do things. It appea
that the present is regarded as appropria
for the “confronting” of the Federal authoi
ties with a petition, “signed by thousam
of citizens,” demanding the repeal of tl
compulsory clauses in the Defence Act. Tl
latest information on the matter was hand'
to me by an elderly lady-canvasser on th
busy day when, full of enthusiasm, the loc
sections of the Brighton (Vic.) regime
were moving out in preparation for ti
defence of home and mother. The aged o:
who brought along her petition seemed qui
unmoved by the intelligence that certa
German warboats were in waters not ve
remote from these shores. The fact a
peared a trifle to her, compared with h
own belief that ‘'little boys of 13 are fore
into the company of boys of the streets
while “a little boy has become a physic
wreck through being starved on bread ai
water because he doesn’t believe in compx
sory training.” The Australian Freedo
League, with its array of highly-color
arguments and its energetic force of intel
gent house-to-housers, had no time for sun
things like unleashed battleships and armi
marching to the slaughter: the little bi
who was fed on bread and water for beii
naughty was the mighty atom that filled tl
League’s whole landscape.

The great ships took their flight.
The sweeping shadows, line on line,
Stretched out across the tide-
/. tested cable, tough and fine —-
A thousand years of pride:
'.fink after link, without a sign,
It went —and Britain sighed.
Fair Britain. Mistress of the North,
She closed the casement then.
As in the years when knights rode forth,
She looked not out again,
But prayed that they with fire and wrath
Might free the sons of men.
Though Rumor creep with tales of dread
Arid conjure sights of fear,
Fair Britain will not turn her head
Or lend an eager ear,
For ancient pride with honor wed
Holds human life not dear.
His sword was keen, his arm was strong
And glorious was his state ;
He held the Right against the Wrong
And Freedom was his mate.
Who finds the-hours too dark —too 10ng?....
His trumpet at the gate!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Germany is being doped with fake news.— Cable.
I sympathise with those poor folk
: (Though enemies they be),
Who daily have to sadly soak
In vague uncertainty.
It makes my indignation fuse;
In fact, I cannot bear,
To think the Germans fake the news—
Thank God, we don’t live there!

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Reginald (commonly known as "Snowy )
Baker is organising a great military tattoo at the
Agricultural Ground for the afternoon, and _an
assault at arms at the Stadium in the evening. The
date is September 7, and all loyal Australians are
notified to keep that day quite clear. The object is
patriotic—to wit, the raising of funds in connection
with the families of the men who are now on active
service. Further particulars will appear in the next
issue.
Ivennington Oval (London), where the
cricket matches used to be, is now in use as a
military drill ground. And still C. B. Fry is look-
ing forward to the day when “Cricket shall be the
bond of union between the nations; the basis of
understanding; the game of games."
A “sporting” cricket match was that
played this English season between old boys of Eton
and Harrow. Ilawke was asked to captain the one,
and A. J. Webbe the other ; but they preferred to let
younger men play. Jackson and Maclaren, both
Harrow, were the veterans of the 22 ; and they
scored 55 and 73. In the Eton team were Bosanquet,
young Tennyson and Johnson, who was here long ago
with Warner’s amateur lot, and now made top score,
102. Harrow led on the first innings, but the game
was left drawn.
* * * *
The war lias knocked to shreds and frag-
ments a goodly array of atmospheric castles in the
sporting world. Three club football teams and a
N.S.W. lacrosse tribe were in readiness for a visit
to Maoriland, but the war has sent the tours to the
dustbin. An amateur expedition to Panama Exhibi-
tion is off. The Australian XI which proposed to
trek to South Africa, will stay in its ain countree
to defend its hearthstone in ease things go tempo-
rarily wrong in the North Sea. The importation of the
army of hike pushers from Europe and America is
suspended till this cruel war is o’er—when a fair
percentage of the best of them will have gone out
in a blaze of glory. It is quite a record hold-up.
* * * *
Another contest that has gone overboard
owing to the war is the race for the America Cup.
The general mind is too occupied by graver thing's
1o be interested in a yacht race—so the event is
postponed for one year.
“Bilrock” (from London, .Tuly 10) :
Merrie England suffered some sad shocks as a result
of the last seven days’ doings in the sporting world.
At Henley, in the greatest rowing carnival of the
year, two American crews, one Canadian and one
German, outed the opposing English rowers in the
Grand Challenge Cup. the Harvard University wiping
the floor of old Father Thames with the famous
Leander Club. Thus J. Bull found himself in the
mortifying position of being without a representative
in the semi-finals, and the British lion dragged his
tail mournfully in the mud. The field narrowed
flown to a final collision between the two Harvard
crews. The Yanks use a short stroke, and their
style is very similar to that of the Australian crew
which swept all behind it at Henley in 1912. Eng-
lish amateur scullers were also left. In the final of
the Diamond Sculls the Cambridge expert. Stuart,
met Sinigaglia, the beefy Italian, who, rowing in
anything but a finished style, pushed his craft in bv
brute strength two or three lengths to the good.
Never in the history of rowing have English clubs
received such a set-hack. It was the triumph of a
modern stroke with devil in it over an antique and
bewhiskered style, said to have been originated by
Charon on the River Styx. Nothing short of a
cyclone, however, will induce John Bull to wake up
and rearrange his stvle. Then the Australian tennis
learn fell upon AVimbledon and smote it hip and
thigh, bestowing the very father of a hiding upon
the English crack players. Spectators were treated
to the astonishing spectacle of a semi-final for the
All England Men's Doubles Championship being- con-
tested by three Australasians (Brookes. Wilding and
Doust) and a Greek (Mavrogordato). For the lasi-
three years tlm Lawn Tennis Singles Championship
of England (which is tantamount to the champion-
ship of the world) has been held by a Maorilander.
who last week lost the title to an Australian. In
the same week Australian cricketer Tarrant, who
had temporarily given place to -T. W. TTearne, jumped
to the front- again in the list of batting averages.
But there are signs of a great awakening. A well-
known sporting writer in one of Uoandon’s big dailies
has come to light with the remark that “the supre-
macy of England in the realm of sport is being
seriously threatened.” #
The Y.R.C. suggestion that, all race-
meetings should he suspended was an essentially fool-
ish development of war scare. Regarded as an
expensive show for the grandstand public, and a
cheap excitement for the flatites, a race meeting has
the recommendation that all the money it causes to
change hands is kept in the country, whereas the
receipts of Harry bander or a foreign musical artist
go mostly out of the country. As to whether it is
less “seenily’-’ to gamble on a racecourse than to
laugh at the performance of an imported comedy co.
when guns are going off in Europe, the V.R.C. is
no licensed censor of the people’s pleasures. If the
people don't want amusement, race meetings will
stop soon enough, without being “suspended on
account of the war,” for the takings will drop to
freezing-point. The one practical patriotic thing'
the racing clubs in Vie. and N S.W. can do is. to
agitate for the legislation of the Tote, which pays
a percentage of its receipts to the Government, and
forces gamblers who live on the game to devote
themselves to other business. Some of them are
even driven to work, and this country needs workers.
The punter who nurses a hope of growing
rich on the losses of benevolent bookmakers had an
object-lesson in the first batch of N. S. Wales Income
Tax prosecutions. Thirty-seven people liable to tax
were sued : and of the lot twenty-nine were book-
makers, who had, it was said, never supplied returns,
on the beautiful plea that, as gambling was illegal,
the Commissioners had no claim. The magistrate,
of course, brushed aside the cheeky inference that
the man who acquires affluence by an illegal occupa-
tion need not pay the taxes which the legitimate
business man has to meet, and imposed tines and
costs total line' £4Ol, Nothing was said about the
taxes that had been dodged for years past; but the
axe of the Commissioners is sharp, and their arm
has a long reach, so McNoses may yet wish he had
paid up by instalments instead of waiting for the
expensive law to pursue him for the lot in a lump.
“Tote”: On May 80 the Wagga (X.S.W.)
Amateur Picnic Race Club held a horse meeting on
the course of the Murrumbidgee Turf Club. Book-
makers were tabooed, but a makeshift totalisator was
run. Its transactions, it was understood, were limited
to members and honorary members. The Crown Law
authorities prosecuted the club officials for betting on
horseraces contrary to the Gaming Act. The defence
was that all the club was doing was to assist its
members to run a series of sweepstakes such a> arc
held by the hundred at every race-meeting, and that
defendants were not personally making a profit out
of the scheme. The magistrate held that the club,
bv allowing its members (hon. or otherwise) to use
the club room for tote purposes, was not guilty of
betting .within the meaning of the Act. That being
so, what’s to prevent any club inaugurating the tote
and making its patrons hon. members on race days?
Uncle Sam, the brilliant gee of two years
ago, had an airing in a six-furlongs sprint at Flern-
ington last Saturday, and ran at the wrong end of
the field all the time. Uncle will do better than
this presently, of course, when he has been put to
strong work again, but as a possible winner of a
big race over a distance the old reprobate is not
worth considering. He seems to be a hopeless case
of nervous dobilitv.

The easy victory of Londonderry in the
Adelaide G. N. Hurdle Race was gall to a good
many punters who backed him for the maiden
hurdle race at Flemington last month. London-
derry then was talked about as a “rod in pickle,”
but his stable companion. Lady Pistol, carried the
money and did the trick. At Adelaide the gelding
met the mare on 111 b. better terms, and both were
placed. In the management of jumping horses the
Adelaide men—Jas. McCann trains Londonderry—
are at the head of their profession.
Judas MePalestine writes bitterly: When
the owners of racing nags hit upon such names as
Whakarewarewa, Algabohnvah, Ootacamund, Mosque-
terie, Mnesarahus, Spegliesen, Laissey, Waukenphast,
and so on, it is not surprising that decent Asiatics
of my tribe get our tongues twisted into knots. Our
errors are excusable in a measure, but a glance
at the Turf Register suggests that owners send the
stable boys to enter their horses on its classic
pages. Anacrion was, presumably, called after the
Greek poet who warbled of wine and women, and
signed his verses Anacreon when he carted them
round to The Bulletin of the day. The brute is a
four-vear-old gelding by Tom Moore, and as that
excellent bard published some translations of his
Greek predecessor, and was occasionally known as
the “Irish Anacreon,” the reason for the horse’s
name is obvious —but why spell it wrongly? Nudity
was the name chosen for one promising filly, and the
animal managed to get loose in the racing world as
New Ditty. There are a few more samples of the
same thing, but these are enough to go on with.
Ali [?] Snylor [?] the scalp of [?]

A pleasant record fell to a ticket-holder in
a Tatt.’s sweep the other day, when one particular
piece of paper drew £5O, £4O and £2O cash
prizes. Writer has sunk some hundreds of pounds in
Tatt.’s dining liis misspent life and never drawn a
copper. The person who can scoop three prizes
on one investment is evidently an abnormality, a
caitiff who has rubbed shoulders with a cross : eyed
Chinaman, a brownie or a Bulgarian general.
How the motor does flourish in Australia!
For the half-year ended June 30 the value of motor
vehicles imported, either whole or in parts, amounted
to £1,032,041 —a bound of £201,632 on the figures
of the previous year. If only half this enormous
mass of manufacturing had been done in Australia
we should not be so hard hit to-day at the mere
rumor of a war in far-away Europe, which war has
not vet properly begun.

,T. It. Hooper, of the Ma State, made small
spuds of the opposition in the Australian billiard
championship at Sydney last week. In the first
round S. 11. Wilson, of South Australia, put up a fine
struggle against the Ma State champion, but
went down when the scores were 1200 to 936 against
him. L. Beauchamp, of Victoria/ outed Artley, of
Queensland, by 1200 to 563. The final proved a
good thing for Hooper over Beauchamp, and the Ma
Stater ran out when the scores stood at 2000 to
1003. Hooper hails from Newcastle, and his mastery
with the cue threatens big things. Those who ought
to know opine that Hooper is the best amateur
N.S.W. has yet produced.
Sydney baseball put up the shutters ou
the second round, on Saturday, and left- the P 1^ 1
ship. very open. The tixture which threatened *
works was the riot between AVaverley and Petersham,
but Petes threw their chance to the wind by bad prun-
ing’, and went to earth by eight runs to me.
AVaverley batters smote pitcher H. t raiicis to the
four corners of the field in the first four innings ant
rattled up eight runs ; bilt, after N. Clarke mounted
the slab, AVaverley crumpled up and failed to score
in the other five innings. It was an excellent effort
by Clarke to save the game, hut, like the historic
pardon, it came too late. Lane Cove and 1 addington
also kicked up considerable dust, and a heavy sconng
game ended in Paddington being scrunched jay 14
runs to 11. In the other fixtures, Leichhardt tell on
Mosman-N. Sydney by 24 runs to two, while Bin-wood
got bine funk and forfeited to ‘Varsity. AVaverley
(13 wins), Leichhardt (12), Petersham (nine). Pad-
dington (seven) are the only clubs with a chance
superior to Buckley’s in the remaining matches ot the
season.
* * ■*'
Bill Anderson passed out the other day -
not the modern AA’illiam who runs the bellowdramas and
gee-gees, but an old-time Victorian bookmaker of the
same name. J. J. Miller writes reminiscently re this
Anderson of yore: “He was one of the promoters ot
the fund, for sending Arthur Orton, the ‘Ticlibornc
Claimant,’ to England, and another of his unlucky
ventures was a scheme to break the bank at Monte
Carlo. Bill Anderson had the late Bill Branch with
him in the bank-breaking job. They prepared an
infallible ‘system,’ and went to Monte Carlo with a
lot of money. They came back convinced. The
bank repulsed the attacking party with heavy loss.”

Sydney and Petersham, in the lacrosse
final at Hampden Oval (Sydney), on Saturday, pro-
vided a tussle worth roaring at. In the first quarter,
Sydney bounded off and led by four goals to one. At
half-time it still had the sniff of victory in its
nostrils, and showed its heels by six goals to four.
The third quarter, however, saw Petersham shake
thing’s up, and go into the lead by seven goals to
six:. The Anal quarter was a hurricane affair, and
Petersham —which probably didn’t fail to have a
dope in the interval—lasted just long enough to win
by 10 goals to nine. The peculiarity about Sydney
lacrosse premiership has been the success of Peter-
sham in gathering the title five times in the past
six years; while Sydney lays claim to filling- the
runner-up position in a like number of seasons.
* * * *
Parramatta to Sydney “semi-Marathon”
on Saturday proved the weak joints in the physical
armor of the competitors. AVarm weather and clouds
of rolling dust played havoc with the bold spirits
who started in the 15-mile jog. Before half-way was
reached distress signals were frequent, and demands
for liquid refreshment were hung out emphatically.
Choked runners reeled into the bars all along the
way and gasped for beer. Some of them couldn’t
even gasp, and merely beckoned for beer. The
roadway was in a shocking state. It always is, but
on this occasion it seemed worse than usual, with
long stretches of broken and unbound blue metal at
frequent intervals. Before a similar race is held
the bloques or coves who choose the track should
be made to walk over the chosen highway. The
result was a win for F. Hourigan, who started from
the 15-minute line; while AV. E. Corben, from
scratch, put up the fastest time by throwing the
broken and decrepit distance behind in llir. 39min.
lOsec.—about four minutes slower than his own
record for the same journey. That dust would
break up anything.

Otago (M.L.) cross-country champion-
ship, decided at Dunedin recently, was won by M.
Mickclson, who beat J. Beatson, the holder and the
present Australasian three-mile champion, bv 100
yards. This is the first time in six years that Beat-
son has been defeated in this event, he having won
it from 1909 to 1913 inclusive.

There was an inter-State savor around the
Enfield to Camden (N.S.AV.) bike races on Saturday,
when, besides a small army of Union competitors
from the cyclists’ amateur body, three AVestralians
faced the starter. Although treated leniently by the
handicapper they were unlucky, and failed to scorch
the countryside into a state of incandescent excite-
ment. The country-side was, apparently, soaked in
some solution of asbestos. Although AV. Holdswortli
won from the fimin. 45sce. start, and C. R. East was
second from 7min. handicap, E. E. Pedersen, the
scratch man, took the honor and the glory and all
the emoluments. This human sky-rocket swept over
the distance in lhr. 38min. 12see.

Inter-State hockey players took advantage
of the absence of lioofball in Melbourne the last fort-
night to carry out their tourney. On Saturday week
Victoria tackled the Croweater land of South Aus-
tialia, and with difficulty won through with four
reals th two: while at mid-week the Cornstalks
demolished the same South Australians by 10 goals
to one. Naturally, when the Mn Staters met the
Gumsuckers on Saturday they felt good and hanpv,
especially as Ma had never been walloped in these
contests, but the lighter and speedier AHetorians,
using better system, stalled off all attacks and mono-
polised what scoring there was. Result was two goals
to nix. Attendances at all the games were poor,
which is a desirable circumstance, hockey being a
recreation that appeals more to players than specta-
tors.

The tour of the Maoriland All Blacks
grows monotonous. On Saturday last at Sydney
Sports Ground the team scored its tenth successive
victory. It was not a battle but a battue, the scores
at the sound of the whistle standing at 22 to seven.
This is not war—that is to say, sport. However, .this
was the last smash, and on Saturday evening, after
bread had been broken and wine luid been spilt, the
ever victorious NA' left by the AVarrhnoo for the land
of the Maori. It scored 246 points against 47-. It
won three'matches, two of thorn consecutive struggles,
in which it scored 41 to nil. It never lost a game,
and it did as it liked.

In the Continental or Australian code
Armageddon is now raging in Sydney. South Aus-
tralia went up against Victoria, and the latter
State won by 77 points to 40. AVestralia knocked
corners off N. S. AA'ales, galloping out with 222
points to 58.

South Sydney looks fairly safe to bag the
football premiership. It still maintains its lead of
one point from Newtown, and as only one more after-
noon of fighting remains, South's chances look cos.'. .
On Saturday, South bumped into North Sydney, and
it was expected that a Homeric scrap would result.
Nothing of the sort happened. North just crumpled
up, blew out and went bung, and South triumphed by
19 to three. Which was plain Banagher. Newtown
kept its end of the log up by falling on the
depleted ranks of Glebe. Something had deprived
Glebe of its best and bravest, and second-grade men
were drafted into the ranks to fill the waste of war.
They were not seasoned to be trodden on by first-
grade men, and though they struggled gamely enough
they had not the faculty of controlling luck —which
is a. fine accomplishment in any walk of luck. Glebe's
name was Sewage, and Newtown leaped delighted to
victory with 18 points to five. Balmain gave West-
ern Suburbs an awful hiding, the figures being f>9 to
eight. This sort of happening is too painful to dwell
upon. Further comment is censored. But this Tittle
list was not in it with the upheaval of Annandale,
which walloped Eastern Suburbs, the premier teajn,
by 16 to 14. Think of it! Writer has always pro-
phesied good things from the plucky, hard-struggling
Annandale crowd, and now that particular mob Has
done it.

In the British Association’s wild and com-
plicated rumpus, which no man who is not a Soccer
enthusiast can follow, Granville is easily ahead in
the First League premiership. It is six points in -
front of the next best, and has only two games to
plav. So it can lose with a light heart. On Satur-
day last Sydney, declining to face the music, passed
in a forfeit. Balmain, which is stronger and more
reliable at Soccer than at any other branch of the
toeball game, downed Annandale by four to nil.
Glebe overthrew Newtown by four to one, and North-
ern Suburbs played a scoreless draw with Canterbury.

Melbourne was without senior football on
Saturday, League and Ass. having agreed to arrange
a vacant date on which the visiting English team
might tackle the N.S.W. Rugby Leaguers, for the edifi-
cation of Victorian innocents —and for the “gate.”
Here it may be remarked that the said “gate” was
hardly worth collecting, a poor 5000 or 0000, largely
M C.C. deadheads, being the measure thereof. The
game was cheerful and willing, but the tremendous
English forwards super-imposed themselves on the
proceedings, and none of their opponents seeijred over-
enthusiastic about tackling the elephants. At half-
time the scores were nine points to eight in Eng-
land’s favor ; but soon after resuming a penalty goal
put the Cornstalks in the lead. After that, Longstaff
was ordered off for rough play, but the teams were
equalised through Leggo being knocked out and having
to retire. The visitors ultimately prevailed, with
three tries (two converted) and four penalty goals to
N.S.W.’s three tries (two converted) and one penalty
goal—2l points to 15. The inexperienced spectators
didn’t seem enamored of the disturbance, many opin-
ing that if the local first-class teams bogged in on
(he reckless lines of the Britishers there would he a
call for more hospitals and ambulances and an extra
cemetery or two.

The Davis Cup comes back to Australasia
after having spent two seasons over the water —
England in 1912 and America in 1913. The new
holders, Brookes and Wilding, with Doust and Dunlop
to fall hack on, had beaten Canada, Germany and
England. Last week they fell on America, the
holders. But it wasn’t a very desperate beating.
U.S.A. relied on McLoughlin and Williams for the
singles, with Bundy to give McLoughlin a hand in the
doubles. McLoughlin was the only one who caused
much damage, and he beat both Brookes and Wilding
in the singles—beat Brookes three straight sets (one
going to 17-15, a Davis Cup long-distance recordl
and Wilding three out of four. Williams lost each of
his singles,’ and the Australasian pair collared the
doubles without much bother. And once more The
Bulletin asks: Who in Australia is going to stand
up against McLoughlin, who is a colt, when Brookes
and Wilding are done? The habit of sending the
same two to play each year may win the Cup, hut it
is mud for the younger nlayers. Australasia lias now
had six wins ; British Isles five : and U.S.A. four.

The sudden come-back of David Smith at
Brisbane is explainable in a dozen different wavs.
Smith may have pulled himself together and made a
supreme effort. On the other hand, flushed by ins
former easy victory, Clabby may have grown careless.
Smith is a stronger man mentallv than the average
boxer, and if he had the moral fibre to pull himself
together after the crushing defeats he had endured,
anything was possible. He might have started on
another career of conquest, for the man who can out-
point Jimmy Clabbv for 20 rounds is obviously up
among the first flighters. That is, of course, it
•Tames were battling at his best. Anyhow, eveiy-
body is glad to hear that our Smith did overcome
that valiant Yankee, and he seems to have done it
in first-class style.

A walloping match that has been looked
forward to for “years and rears,” as the parson said,
eventuates at Sydney Stadium next Saturday night
when the pride of Australian lightweights, Hughie
Mehegan and Herbert McCov, will battle for the
championship of Australia. Mehegan’s luck has been
out for some time now, c.ud in meeting McCoy he is
up against the battle of his career. If he loses this
ho will fall from his high estate, and he no moiC’
ohamnion. If he wins, he will have demonstrated
that he is no back-number, and. in spite of his recent
defeats by foreigners, is still the best Australian
lightweight. It should be a sterling battle, as both
youths are, hard hitters and belong to the class of
fighters that hits all the time. They are always
good to watch.

The Milburn Saylor-Joe Shugrue contest
at Svdney Stadium on Saturday night was not tne
rousing contest that was expected. True to his
word Saylor “fought clever,’’ and his clever fighting,
though more skilful, is not nearly so picturesque
as his whirlr-whirly style. Shugrue seemed to x
somewhat off. He was not the bounding wild cat or
a previous night. He lacked the speed that in
enabled him to land blow after blow and escape a
return compliments that were flying about, it wa.
more of genuine fight on his part, and more or
boxing exhibition on the part of Saylor, tna
young man having suddenly awakened to a Pr°V-
appreciation of the value of correct, timing,
result was that he succeeded in giving that brig ■
and elusive youth more than Shugrue could r ' ls P e ,,
to him. It was a good scrap, hut had not tn
atmosphere of wild excitement that usually tna ,
terises the Saylor battles. There was no great ■
decisive victory about it. But there was a sumc-
ently ample margin in favor of Shugrue to save

The co., which owned many freeholds, and
wrote them down pretty severely some years
ago, decided recently that it was a good
time to sell and then centralise its opera-
tions. In 1911-12 considerable business was
done in that way, and again last year. As
at June, 1912, freeholds were in the books at
£lB.OOO and leaseholds at £37,500. Last
year, after the further sales, the freeholds
were revalued and £lO,OOO was added to their
book value. Obviously, though it was pro-
posed to make other sales, there isn’t very
much left to do in that direction; and on the
present look of things it is just as well,
seeing that the property market isn’t likely
to get back for many a day to where it was
a few months ago.
The sale of property, along with a certain
amount of machinery and plant, has put a
different face on the accounts in recent
years:—■

Cash and book
debts, etc. 32,177 55,251 60,907 81,647 122,433
Thus in the last 12 months cash and book
debts, including shares in other cos., have
increased by £40,786, while liabilities have
been reduced by £8893. Total £49,679. This
amount has been made up by reducing stocks
(£14.916), selling assets or writing them
down out of profits (£32,441), and accumu-
lating visible profits (about £2000). The
big item, “Cash and book debts, etc.,” cannot
be split up: but assuming that they are a
good lot, then the co.’s position is extra-
ordinarily good. And it is incredible that a
eo. like Goodlet and Smith, with an enviable
reputation behind it and a splendid name to
carry on with, would gild a doubtful item
with its cash. Together this item and the
properties represent practically the full
amount of the capital (£165,000), leaving
the stock and the plant and machinery—
which has been severely written down during
the last few years—to represent the reserves
and the handful of liabilities. As things
have turned out the reduction of the stocks
is greatly in the co.’s favor. There is going
to he a severe and probably long slump in
such materials as Goodlet and Smith mostly
handle; and when money in stocks that you
can’t sell is earning nothing but insurance
bills, it is a fine thing to have it in some-
thing else. Profits from trading will pro-
bably shrink a good deal: still, if the big
composite item before mentioned is as good
as the cash which forms part of it. the co.
may reckon itself extremely fortunate in
disposing of property and fixed assets and
in reducing its stocks just when it did.

That is an uncomfortable shrinkage in
profits; and of course the directors’ report
doesn’t explain it. Directors’ reports very
rarely do. In nine cases out of 10 you have
to he a friend of somebody’s to find out
whether a shrinkage is just a bit of passing
had luck or the result of a disease which is
likely to be chronic. All the light that can
be thrown upon the trouble in this case is
derived from this comparison:—

1913 . . 12,888 7532 58.5 „
1914 .. 11,807 7814 66.2 „
Operating exes, include wages, fuel, taxes,
maintenauce (but not allowance for depre-
ciation) and salaries; and it looks as though
some of these items are moving along fast.
If isn't all wages, either: “salaries” have
moved like this-—£623, £745, £B7O. The
interest bill is also moving up : hut the new
capital may arrest it. Altogether, then, it
doesn’t seem as if a mere passing stroke of
bad luck has cut at the profit. Costs gener-
ally have gone up; and it’s usually a tough
job to pull them down again. it
is worth noting that, after allowing for
depreciation, there isn’t now any large mar-
gin of profit beyond the amount required to
pay the 10 p.c. dividend. Certainly the new
£lO,OOO of capital lately got in may not
have been earning its best throughout the
half-year, though it has been favored with a
full half-year’s dividend. As for the security of
the capital in the business nothing much
can be said, because five-sixths of the assets
are shovelled into one untidy heap—“ Fre-
ehold and leasehold properties, plant and
machinery, rolling stock, _ goodwill, water
supply, etc.” —and there is no telling liow
much of this is good, honest beer and how
much is goodwill froth. On the whole, the
position doesn’t look as good as the dividend.

“Nixpenee”: War pays-—tile newsboys.
During last week, when editions were pouring
out of the Sydney offices as fast as news and
alleged news concerning' the trouble in
■Europe would admit, the sellers were coining
money. One of them cleared £5 Ins. before
knocking off for tea.
A new English half-crown quarterly
announces itself as “The manifesto of the
Vortieists,” who seek to aim a “death-blow
to Impressionism and Futurism and all the
refuse of naif science.” But if its purpose
is vague its title, at any rate, is expressive:
it is the one beautifully simple word. Blast !
-Jf * # *
“.T.F.11.”: I have my doubts about the hustle
which has followed the alleged modernisa-
tion of London’s inky way. Chamberlain
passed out at 10 o’clock on a Thursday
night, in his London mansion in the South
Kensington quarter, and not a single Friday
morning paper had a line about it. Even
the Daily .\Jail. which is nearly always on
the spot, was napping. Immediately after
the death the two doctors posted a notice
to that effect on the porch, but either nobody
bothered to read it, or, if anybody did read
it. he did not know that it was
news worth money. Of course, if the
morning papers had known that Joseph
was sicker than usual (he had been
helpless for eight years) they would
have been on the alert, but the family was
reticent and gave no public intimation of
danger. So the Friday evening papers got
a scoop, and the Saturday morning ones
seemed ashamed of themselves in their stale
editorial appreciations and pages of belated
biography.
C. A. Pearson, the English newspaper
man. having gone blind himself, is battling in
London for a big fund to provide blind
readers with Braille literature. Just bow
much money is needed Pearson indicated in
a note tbe other day: “Ivanhoe” cost £4o
for plates to start with, and then every copy
cost 10s. fid. to produce.
"J.F.H.”: T. P. O’Connor, one of tbe
Irish M’s.r.. has built up a record in the
Inky Way. He started the Star. London’s
halfpenny evening paper, quarrelled with
partner Prof. Stuart (nephew of a one-time
Premier of N.S.WO, and retired. After
that be founded another evening paper, the
Sun. and passed it on to Horatio Bot-
tomle.v. Next it was a gossiping weekly—-
M.A.P. Here be quarrelled with partner
Iharson, and retired. T.P.’s Weekly fol-
lowed: and now he is quitting that “in order
to establish a new journal in the autumn.”
In a spare moment he also founded T.P's.
Monthly, hut that perished before he bad
time to quarrel with anybody. “T.P.” turns
out a tremendous amount of copy every week
for London and American papers, and is
constantly clicking his typewriter in the
House of Commons.

“Poetaster”: I recently visited Adam
Lindsay Gordon’s old home. Dingley Dell,
about a mile from the ocean at Port Mac-
Donnell (S.A.). and not far front Cape
Northumberland lighthouse. The cottage
nests in a pretty nook surrounded by a wood
of typical Australian trees. Of course, the
house shows signs of age and neglect, and
like the Pyramids of Ghizeh. the Wall of
China and the Eiffel Tower, there are dis-
tinguished names scribbled over if. such as
Potts. Watts, Clegg, Higgins, Ham and Wjn-
terbotham. The pronerty is owned by a
Mount Gambicr publican, and is carefully
locked up to keep out the nine Muses and
other vagrants.
GOING GENTLY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
(War poem made by a nervous bard with a censor
in the next room.)
I do not know a single thing,
But —/ am, not to tell!
So, in an undertone, 1 sing
That war is always Hell.
(Indeed it is—it's Hell!)
There’s just one thing to write about;
But nothing’s coming through,
And ITE sits ready to knock out
The little things 1 do —
The songs and pars. I do.
Down in the street news-liars ydl
The “news’’ of yesterday,
And eagerly to asses sell
The same old truss of hay-—
The stale, familiar hay.
Vague rumors hurtle round the town;
None can their authors catch ;
So many up—so many down.
It’s like a cricket match- -
Some distant cricket match.
I hear no gun —1 see no smoke;
The only foe / see
Is that perambulating- bloke
Who sells stale “news” to me —-
Poor, unimportant me!
And yet—-and yet I'm not to tell!
I Vho says that modern war ain't Hell?

[FOR THE BULLETIN]
[ wrote u title poem oti the European War;
1 used a lot of tricky rhymes no poet used before;
1 filled it up with slaughter and 1 sprinkled it with

To heights of verse my pen soared !
1 wrote in patriotic mood of England and of France;
I urged the Empire onward, and I yelled to it,
“Advance!”
1 smote the German heavily: my pen became a

But it was censored!

Y
LIGHTING EXPERTS AGREE
that the qualities of Economy, Brilliancy and
Durability are essential in a satisfactory lamp.
Tests of various lamps give the following results :
1. CARBON LAMPS. This type proved durable
but deficient in economy and brilliancy —
therefore satisfactory only in one feature.
2. METAL LAMPS (pressed filament). Although
economical and brilliant, found lacking in
durability—satisfactory in two qualities.
3. MAZDA DRAWN WIRE LAMPS stood up
excellently on test, and possessed the three
qualities essential to complete satisfaction.

NO MORE THIN PEOPLE.
HOW THIN MEN AND WOMEN CAN
PUT ON FLESH QUICKLY.
There are many thin people, ladies
especially, who long to increase th ;! weight,
yet imagine they can only do so b% physical
exercise or stuffing themselves wi, , food —
but poor health and small appetite >v'U not
allow of these methods. Generally speaking,
however, such people cannot become plump
and well' developed in this way, they are
thin and unhealthy because they do not
assimilate the proper proportion of the food
they eat. To these the use of Phormoid, a
highly concentrated food product possessing
remarkable properties for increasing the
power of assimilation by feeding and
strengthening the nerve tissues, is strongly
advised. Simply get a supply of the stan-
dard 20-grain tablets from your chemist and
eat one tablet before each meal. Your appe-
tite will quickly improve—you will have a
pleasant feeling of renewed vitality and fit-
ness for work and pleasure, and your weight
will increase with astonishing rapidity.
Caution to Ladies.—Tliin ladies who
object to an increased bust development
should not take Phormoid, as it- generally
develops the bust from three to four inches
in a few weeks*

IN BANANA LAND
Eight men employed by the Brisbane
Water Board recently struck for higher
wages, on account of having to work in mud
Extra wages for working in mud? Nonsense!
Queensland politicians do it at the usual
pay, and you never hear a grumble from
them !
“Rangan”: Time is proving to Banana-
land the value of her scrub lands. The
largest and richest of them all, the Atherton
tableland, is receiving some of the attention
that has been owing to it for years. This
land consists of a patch of cedar scrub 130
miles long by 30 miles wide, and cedar scrub
soil is the richest of all scrub soils. The place
is about 3500 ft. above sea-level, with the
bracing climate that makes the dairyman’s
hehrt rejoice. Richmond River and South-
ern Queensland dairymen have gone there
in dozens in the last year or two,
and the results obtained have exceeded the
highest hopes. The soil grows any quantity
of paspalum, Rhodes grass, panicum and
clover, and one farmer’s cream returns for
June averaged 30s. per cow. This year a
butter-factory has been erected, and is ex-
pected to turn out, before the end of the
year, over 25 tons of butter a week.

“Rangan” : Bananaland is preparing legis-
lation to increase the power of its stunted
District Courts. These institutions haven’t
been revised for 20 years, and badly need
repair. The chief objects of the alterations
are to give them power to take some of the
work off the hands of the Supreme Courts,
and thPs'save the time, trouble, expense and
delay of litigants. To make up for the addi-
tional toil D.C. judges are to have their
salaries increased from £lOOO to £l2OO,
which, considering the importance of the
work they do and the wage George Reid
draws, is not exactly munificent.- If now
Police Courts were revised and their
jurisdiction extended, affairs in Bananaland
would be about balanced. I don’t propose,
of course, that the Bobby Courts should pass
capital sentences on drunks. And whereas,
in .the old crude style of melodrama the
w/ongfully-convicted man who had escaped
from Dartmoor, with the fragments of his
life-sentence trailing behind him, used to
have his conviction cancelled and his estate
restored to him by the cop at the street
corner on production of the lost document,
I hold that it is better to stick to the old
stolid order of things. The cop at the-scorner
might be a cheap court, but he was unreli-
able. Still the idea of shifting a certain
amount of work to the inferior tribunals is
none the less meritorious.
The Wages.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Women do better work than men. They make
better dairymaids. Any member would sooner feel
the soft, white hand of a woman tonsorial artist
on his face than the rough grip of a man. A
woman was the best typist in the world, and he felt
sure that members would rather have a smart, dainty
woman to do their typewriting than a man. — M.L.A.
recently advocating equal pay for the sexes.
He was a legislator bold,
Who made a thrilling speech,
Wherein he pled with tears —and told
How dainty Dolly Peach,
Who toiled for half man’s daily wage
Could come in competition
With any males who till the age
With anger and sedition.
Could make the trousered tyrant yield,
Could win her way without him,
Could face the foe in open field,
Or turn his flank —and rout him.
“For instance,” said that orator —
“My chin-growth here, arboreal
This morn a buxom maiden shore
With lily hand tonsorial;
“And as she smoothed the tender face
Of Me —the Politician,
I found her all compact of grace
A shapely shearing vision.
“There is no man here would prefer
A masculine typewriter
With bristling beard in place of her
Who makes his office brighter.
“And how could man drop pen or plow
To supersede the fairy
Who pats the sow, or milks the cow
In well-conducted dairy?
“Where’er in this industrial mill
I meet the female toiler
I find her high in zeal and skill
Above the whiskered moiler;
“And in the lines where gentle touch
And kindly glance are needed
No man could ever give you such
A treat as charming She did!”
* * * *
That night that same Demosthenes
Was found abroad and raving—
“My missis turned me out to freeze
Because of Dolly’s shaving.
“She says she’ll pull my office down
On gentle typist Mary,
And show me up about that brown
Young hussy in the dairy;
“And when I plead : ‘That speech, my dear,
Was only ideality,’
She grips again my handiest ear
And cries : 'This is Reality!’
“No more I’ll champion ladies fair
Against the Wrongs of Ages,
I guess the sex that raised my hair
Can also raise its wages!”
QUEENSLAND.
PHILANDER F.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, August 15, 1914.
My Dear Tiiargomindaii,—
This has been a most exciting week; a
jumble of patriotic meetings, races, fat
cattle, dust, noise and children. The last
four were banded together at the Show, of
which they seemed to be the greater part.
Mayoress Jenkinson has been making her
gentle voice heard at various patriotic
gatherings this week. On Thursday 257
women surged round the door of the Town
Hall and endeavored to squeeze themselves
into the deliberative room of our City
Gran’fers. Eventually, the Mayor, with
perspiration in his voice, announced that
the Albert Hall had been hurriedly borrowed
to meet the rush of business, whereupon
there was a great sound of swishing skirts
and a clatter of shoes making for the ren-
dezvous. Colonel Lee, the indefatigable
Mayor, Colonel Sutton, P.M.0., Colonel
Harris and Major Butler all made speeches,
and the meeting formed a Red Cross Society.
Also, it dropped £212 into the neat military
cap of Colonel Sutton. This, together with
as much more as the Society can gather in,
will be blewed in medical stores and com-
forts for the British Army, or for our defend-
ers in case of invasion. If any other Queens-
land women want to help, they should write
to the hon. sec., Mrs. L. M. Bond, Crescent-
road, Hamilton, Brisbane.
Mrs. William Collins, the pretty little
squatteress, has given £lOO to the society,
and, with Mesdames Ross-Munro, Cecil
Palmer and E. K. Tully, is arranging a big
ball for next Tuesday night.
Brisbane theatricals have, as usual,
generously given their time and money to
the good cause, and a big matinee, at which
every show in the city will be represented,
is to be held in H. M. Theatre on Tuesday
week. The proceeds go to the Mayor’s
patriotic fund.
The mgin social item of the week was the
QueensTSjud Club Ball on Tuesday night.
The whole top floor of Winchcombe, Car-
son’s big'wool store at Bulimba was used,
and for once in the social history of Bris-
bane several hundreds of people were able
to dance in comfort. The little hall at the
South Brisbane Technical College is about
the only prancing pavilion in town, and it
is far too small for requirements. The big
wool store looked like a botanical garden.
A small forest of palm trees must have been
slaughtered to line the walls and make the
pretty little sitting-out places. Sweet peas
were the floral decorations on the supper-
tables, and these were enhanced by white
chicken, pink candles, green and purple
salads and other delicacies. The band was
from Toowoomba. A. 11. Wittingham and
wife did the necessary with the official wel-
coming hand.
The races on Wednesday and again this
afternoon were largely attended. A run of
outsiders romped home to-day, and one
quadruped snared £3O for the lucky few who
backed him on the tote. If .they had been
doing business with a bookmaker they might
have snared as much as 30s. or else got a
back view of the bookie as he fled over the
horizon.
Dolores gave two concerts here this week,
and collected some truck-loads of flowers on
each occasion. On ( Tuesday afternoon Mrs.
Crase gave a tea-party in her honor, andi
on Friday the Brisbane Women’s Club per-
suaded her to a reception. Pianist Elsie-
Hall should have been there too, but she-
couldn’t come. So she was absent. Dolores
shed smiles on all the company and compli-
mented a few local amateurs who tickled'
the piano with their fingers or hit the old!
welkin with their voices. ■
Yours faithfully,
AUSTRLIA JANE.
Labor-leader Ryan: “We want to do some-
tiling.” Minister Blair: “You want to do*
somebody.” That’s the crux of Party Gov-
ernment —Bill trying to “do” Jim out of'
his job, and Jim defending it tooth and!
nail.
“Rangan” : They rather overdo tbe depu-
tation business in Bananaland. Recently
three people came 400 miles to Brisbane to
try to borrow £l7 from Treasurer Barnes..
They wanted the money to patch up a broken
road. The road certainly needed patching
(most Bananaland roads do), but the shire-
council which they represented could have
done a deal towards it, if not the lot, by
bogging in with the money wasted on the
jaunt to Brisbane. Incidentally the deputa-
tion arrived just when the city had on its
glad rags and top hat to attend the annual
Show. This may or may not have had
something to do with the case. Anyhow,
Barnes hit the request to the boundary with-
out unnecessary apology.
“Lex”: Cabled to-day (17/8,/’l4) that
Japan has delivered an ultimatum to Ger-
many to get out of Kiao-Chau. This may be
taken to mean that Nippon is in the present
conflict for keeps. A declaration of war is
not an essential nowadays. An ultimatum
may take its place. Hostilities commence on
the hour fixed in the ultimatum, and the
subsequent declaration, if one is issued,
amounts merely to an intimation to neutrals
that a state of war exists.
“The Old Soldier”: How little we have
heard in the present scrap about the new
weapons—the “cheap submarine,” the mis-
sile torpedo, the Zeppelin and the aeroplane.
A submarine has been sunk, a few ’planes
have been used for reconnoitring—and that
is about all. Some of us were not quite
unprepared to find the torpedo rather less
effective than it is supposed to be. In the
Jap-Russ war, Togo’s flagship, the Mikasa,
is said to have been torpedoed by mistake,
but it was not much the worse. In the
Balkan war the Turkish cruiser Hamidieli.
was torpedoed in the bow by the Bulgarians..
Repaired by tbe Turks, it was making his-
tory in the Mediterranean within three-
weeks. Science doesn’t seem to be in it,.
after all, with a steady, reliable supply of'
human meat.
“Hamer”: A peculiar situation lias been-
created by the death of Gregor McGregor
in regard to the Senate elections in S.A..
The passing of McGregor automatically
cancels his nomination. Every Labor voter
will have to give his sixth vote to one or
the other of the Liberal six. In such a case
it is likely that one of the least promising
Liberals will be selected, because he will
bring tbe least intelligence into the enemy’s
camp. Many Laborites believe that they
are still entitled to cast a vote for the dead
hero, but even if they elected him there
would be a vacancy, which will be filled by
the South Australian Parliament nominat-
ing the losing Liberal with the highest tally
of votes. Apparently each party should
have a dummy candidate or understudy
whose votes don’t count unless one of the
real candidates passes out while the election
is in progress. That is to say, the under-
study candidate should vote for himself, but
no one else should be allowed to vote for
him unless he is wanted.

IN Bostoek shoes the feet always feel beauti-
fully light and comfortable; and the wearer
is ready for a garden party or any smart func-
tion. So perfect are their fitting properties that
the shoes positively feel as though they have been
made specially. Every time they are worn the
wearer experiences a sense of satisfaction, wohder-
fully like that enjoyed in a smart Parisian
gown; and this feeling is intensified by knowing
that the shoes are exclusive in style and exquis-
itely finished.
Bostocks are the cream of imported shoes.
Special shipments have recently arrived at the
leading stores, and ladies should call before the
choicest styles are sold.

W. Ingers: In this paper’s opinion the
purest English isn’t spoken anywhere in par-
ticular. Pure English is largely a matter of
individual, opinion. Thus Alderman Thomas Henley,
of Sydney, considers that his method of employing
the language is correct, while Arthur Balfour, M.P.,
of London, would probably commit suicide rather
than talk like Henley. Boston (U.S.), which uses
phrases like “gotten,” is as satisfied that it is right
as "Oxford (England) ; and Shakspeare would need
an interpreter to understand either of them. ... J.R.:
Thafks. When things settle down, it might be
worth while going into the case with a view to
getting the youngster some relief. Let’s hear from
you then. .. .T. Tabby: It was a good yarn once. . ...
Archibald F. : Wind Billy: True, maybe; but
there’s no hope of saying so just n0w....Le0 B.:
When a yarn is returned in that way it may be
taken as a hint that the editor, though he didn’t
want it himself, thought it might be worth submit-
ting somewhere else.... Old Reader: (1) Yes; the
information was given to the captain of the Swan-
hilda. The papers that were handed him in mid-
ocean showed that the police knew Butler to be
aboard as a seaman. The captain and the mate kept
the news to themselves until the Swanhilda was
boarded at the Golden Gate; (2) Senior-detective
Roche (now Superintendent of Detectives), Detective
Mcllattie and Constable Conroyd. .. . Yank : Sir
William Johnson was born in Ireland, and went to
U.S.A. in 1738. As a fur trader and soldier he
acquired great influence amongst the Indians, whom
he often led against the French. It was he who
enlisted and equipped (under instructions) the Six
Nations (Iyoquois) against French Canada. After-
the death of his wife, Catherine Wisenberg, he had
many mistresses, amongst them Molly Brant, sister of
the famous chief, Joseph Brant. Can’t swear she was
styled Lady Molly, but it is probably correct....
G.: No interest in the bygone aviation prediction of
Kepler that Germans would yet inhabit the moon.
Perhaps he was right. They appear likely to go
sky-high, anyhow. ... D. 0.: Can't republish....
Henley: Not known to this office. Shouldn’t think
it was right in the sense your letter conveys....
Brumby: It’s a good story, spoiled by the fact that
there's a wages-board award in that industry, and the
young women get the benefit of it whether they are
unionists or merely loafers on the unionism of others.
. ...J.M.: The Peacocks who make jam and the
Peacocks who make strange noises are different birds
altogether. .. .Cowslip: The Commonwealth Govern-
ment has nothing to do with land laws ; but so far
as N. S. AVales is concerned there’s a provision more
liberal in most respects than the S’African land-
purchase law mentioned. .. .F.E.W.: No use to
us. Try the public hangman. .. .Isabel M. M.:
Sorry verses not strong enough. Verses that
can stand on their own feet are at present in
most demand. .. .Bayonet: It is rather late to start
shouting “Prepare!” Write something about “For-
ward!”... .William F. G.: In a time of excursions
and alarums, you arrive as an extra infliction.
Can’t you join something or go somewhere in a
tremendous hurry ? Go and annoy the enemy....
Bugle: Sentiments excellent, but you don’t blow
hard enough. .. .Alice F.: Your gentle preoccupa-
tion with violets and paddocks is pleasing in this
time of stress, but your violets are somewhat faded
and your paddocks du11.... Sapper: “Where are my
comrades sleeping?” Don’t know. But the odds are
they’re not sleeping at all. . . .W.J.C. (M.L.) : Yes,
“the firm’s” Gilbert and Sullivan operatics are
booked for M.L. at the end of the year. . . .J.W.B.
(V.) : You have diagnosed it correctly—it is a chest-
nut E.P.McC.: Stop it now! F.M.11.: (M.L.) :
Smith torpedoed and sunk.. . .F.S.McD.: Too much
wattle about your poem.... Ben Rio: Very labored
verse... .L.McI.: Sort of apoplectic seizure in verse.
. . . .Eulomogo: Nothing original about it, but it is
melodious. No print value here. . . .W.R.McA.: Par-
tially dead poem received. Case hopeless. .. .J.S.
(Sydney): Unsuitable. ... G.S. (Bondi): The old
trouble—fine spirit, poor verse. .. .P.T.B : Doesn’t
raise a shriek. .. .L.V.Y.: Old idea dully handled....
L.H.P. (Q.) : Your verse is just amputated prose. .. .
Bowyangs: Too strained. . . .Miss E. S. (S.A.) : Passed
on to Babette’s husband... .Mallee S.: Not enough
in it.... Alice: YYm’re too late for Darlinghurst. Try

has to work with you.. . . Stalworth: Here you are —
if it is you:—
GENTLEMEN, THE PELICAN.
Here's to the bird they call the pelican !
He can hold more in his bill than his belly can !
He can hold more in his beak than he can eat for a
week —
And I don’t know how in the hell he can!
. ...F.D.M.: One is over the edge and the other is
into the basket.... Author of “Black Squad”: You
have not attached your name and address. Let us
have both. Manuscript tied up in the meantime. .. .
Bal M.: Too awful for print, but just right for
the basket. . . .Gay O’Hara: Pleasantly written, but so
slender ,it hung easily on a cobweb that Martha
Washington had overlooked. .. .C.W.M.: Don’t know
who published “The Mongrel Grey.” Try some of
the Sydney bookshops... .Wombatina: Your “ode”

we’d been overcharged 3Jd... .Curlew: You're an-
other short-weighter whom the basket has swallowed.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
Ron S.: “Will you kindly let me know what is
wrong with the sketch?” There is nothing right
with it.... Gee Gee; Nothing terrible about your
War God—he’s merely fat. (P.S. —Almost anyone
can be fat.)... .William R.: Suggestions of no value.
....E. Rhodes: Sketch is far worse than the war.
. ...N.P. (Melb.) : Gag is no good, and sketch shows
that you haven’t been learning steadily during your
five years. .. .G.G.K.: That subject is an impossible
one just now J.T. J.: No more sparkle than a
cow 5.G.8.: The only interesting thing about your
drawing is the fact that the lady-blob has a crow or
magpie under her armchair. Stop being an amateur
in blue and white on lined writing-paper... .Iv.K.K.:
Both figures look as if they had been boiled
Warragul: Old ? Why, it was old enough to get
into a pantomime three years ago... .A.D.: Picture
too incongruous. The bleat is Oxford, the hats are
nondescript, the coats are slop-made, the shoes and
socks are of “the block,” and the faces hail from
Surry Hills. Also the soldiers are German.

There seems to be prevalent among hotel
managers an intense dislike to the guests
drinking water in their rooms; and to dis-
courage the practice usually only one glass is
placed in each bedroom. This, of course, is
generally used for laundrying the teeth, and
nobody but a person of the depraved tastes
m
of a German Emperor
would care to use for
a drinking vessel the
same utensil with
which he conducts his
teeth-scrubbing. And
even where there are
two glasses provided,
no effort is made to
distinguish which are
jaw-baths and which
are water glasses. All
good mouth washes
have flavors which
linger long and cling
hard, and even when
there is nothing to dis-
tinguish the molar bath from the drinking
glass they are bound to get used indis-
criminately. What is required is a glass for
mouth scrubbing which is obviously intended
for that only. Difference in shape is not
sufficient. There should be some easily-
recognised distinguishing mark, which would
be understanded of by all men. The Odol
Company, of London, is offering such a glass
—a specially-designed toilet tumbler, with
the word “Odol” plainly etched on the side—
and, as all civilised people connect “Odol”
and teeth, the use is obvious. The eo.
supplies these glasses at quite a nominal
price.*

By simply wearing a Danjhill Earphone a deaf person can sit in a room and hear
all the conversation with perfect ease. It collects sounds from all directions without
losing any of their strength.
It transmits the voice clearly, and can be used in a Public Hall, Theatre or Church.
For years past Jerdans Ltd. have been successfully attending to the eye
troubles of the public.

The Vic. Public Service offices had a
lovely joke last week. One or two conse-
quential blokes at the Treasury building had
drawn up a circular laden with questions as
to what kind of a patriot the recipient would
like to be —soldier, special constable or what
not. This was an attempt to get in front
of the military recruiting officers, and its
only apparent cause was the author’s desire
for advt. The circular was solemnly para-
graphed in the dailies, and the juniors in
the service sent in their answers without
questioning the authority of the bloke who
was worrying them. But one day a skit on
the uncalled-for document was posted up in
the Treasury, and before the authorities
could tear the thing down it had sufficed to
blow out the circular aforesaid. The skit
had a list of 19 questions to be answered,
beginning with “What is your fighting
weight?” and ending with “Can you state
the policy of Cook.” One of the 17 inter-
mediate questions was “Have you done any
barrow pushing?”
Moltke, the nephew of the great strategist,
who is now Chief of the German General
Staff, is one of the few who has had the
nerve to stand up to the Kaiser and tell him
when he was acting foolishly. One of Wil-
liam’s fads was to lead cavalry charges at
manoeuvres. Moltke stopped this, declaring
that charges by masses of cavalry were not
practical tactics, and were calculated to
cause losses out of all proportion to anything
that could be gained by them. He also in-
sisted on night operations and night marches
being constantly practised. The cable tells
both of night work and of charges made by
great masses of German cavalry resulting in
heavy loss. If these stories are true it would
seem that in at least one respect the Empe-
roar has overborne the judgment of his Chief
of Staff. But the war cable is notoriously
our most prominent liar nowadays.
Thus Melbourne Akgus :
Faced by war, Australians recognise that at the
very least they must submit to diminished revenues
and increased taxation. If need arises they are
prepared to see their country bled white by the
drain of its resources in order to preserve its integ-
rity and that of the Empire with which it stands or
falls.
Yet when Fisher proposed to spend coin on
unifying the railway gauges and doing other
important defence work, the Argus wailed
that unless the electors trod heavily on
such hair-brained proposals, there was mil-
lions of defence taxation looming ahead —-
and Australia was expected to shudder at
the very thought of it. The Argus is quite
willing that Australia should be bled white,
apparently; but with its big, broad views it
insists that its own handy-man shall have
the job of sticking the pig.
[B. J. H. Owen, 108 Albert-street, East Melbourne.]
The Ardath Tobacco Company, the pro-
prietors of the well-known State Express,
Winfred and Splendo Cigarettes, and the
famous Ardath Smoking Mixtures, has taken
the lead in harnessing scientific methods to
the needs of Commerce. To the State Ex-
press Motor Delivery Van it has,' after
much experimenting, added a complete
wireless installation by means of which the
traveller on his daily round is enabled t©>
communicate at any time of th» day with
the head offices in Finsbury. In this way
the urgent requirements of the Company’s
customers are dealt with more speedily than
is possible even by the use of the telephone,
and the facilities so afforded have already
been taken extensive advantage of. The State
express car is fitted with a complete trans-
mitting set. capable of getting into communi-
cation with the head office within a radius
of 20 miles. The Company has experimented
for a considerable time in this direction, and
many difficulties have had to be overcome
before satisfactory connections could be ob-
tained. An ingenious feature of the installa-
tion is the method adopted for completing the
circuit and making “an earth” by dropping
a metal chain on to metallic manholes or
drains, or by trailing same in water.*


On Face, Hands and Legs. Ashamed
to Take Children Out. Looked
Dreadful. Used Cuticura Soap
and Ointment, In Fortnight Quite
F ree from Sores.
427 Bay St., Port Melbourne, Vic.—
“ Some time ago my two children were suf-
fering from very nasty sores on face, hands

and legs. I tried various
remedies "without any good
results. Seeing a testimo-
nial in “Age,” a case the
same as his being cured by
Cuticura Ointment and
Soap, I obtained some of
these and started oo use
them. I first made a strong
lather of Cuticura Soap and
hot water, bathed sores well with it and
applied Cuticura Ointment on clean rag. I
have much pleasure in informing you that
in a fortnight they were quite free from
sores. Before I tried Cuticura Soap and
Ointment I was really ashamed to take the
children out. They looked dreadful and
the neighbours were afraid to let their little
ones play with mine, in case they got sores
also. I think Cuticura is splendid also for
the hair, as it cleanses the scalp from dan-
druff, etc., and so promotes growth.
“My sister is at present using it for
eczema on arms and neck. I think Cuticura
is the best soap one can use.” (Signed)
Mrs. May Poison, Sept. 25, 1912.
For treating poor complexions, red, rough,
hands, and dry, thin and falling hair, Cuti-
cura Soap and Cuticura Ointment have been
the world's favorites for more than a genera-
tion. Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment
are sold throughout the world. Liberal sam-
ple of each mailed free, with 32-p. Skin Book.

If you would like to see the alteration Grey Hairs
make, just lay a piece of paper over each of the two
halves of the above portrait. The Grey “half” will
then be seen to have the appearance of 45 years of
age, whereas the other half looks only 30. Dr. B.
Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut Stain will make
all those years of difference if you are grey or prema-
turely grey. It is perfectly harmless, easy to apply,
and will quickly restore the Hair to the natural shade
of youth, or younger years.

CATARRH CENTRES OF THE HEAD.
“ Kat-ar-ah " Treatment provides an rnlar'iea
Supply of medicated air to soothe and heal
these discharging surfaces.
THE MENACE OF
CATARRH!
There are few human ailments which create such
discomfort and misery as Catarrh —the mother of
all disease. It pursues you at work and at play;
it is with you everywhere, threatening Deafness,
Throat Diseases, Bronchitis, Asthma, Dyspepsia,
Neuritis and Consumption; making you down-
hearted, ruining your hopes, wrecking your life
and holding the weapon of greater suffering
always before you.
Those offensive discharges from the nose, the partial loss of
hearing, the irritating head-noises, the dry “ stopped-up ” feel-
ing in the nostrils, the constant sneezing, the husky throat, the
frequent headaches, the continual hawking and spitting to dislodge
the mucous secretions, the heavy tired feeling when you awake—
these symptoms are as nothing compared with the fact that you are
inviting the entry of some worse affliction if you neglect Catarrh.
Free to Sufferers .
To all who are afflicted with Catarrh in any form I offer a FREE
TRIAL of “ Kat-ar-ah ” Inhalant. It gives immediate relief to
the inflamed membranes, clears the head, nose, throat and
lungs, conveys health-giving, purifying and germ-destroying
medicated air to the affected parts and cleanses the nasal
passages of accumulated mucous. No matter how many remedies
you may have tried do not consider your case hopeless until
you have tried ‘ ‘ Kat-ar-ah ’ ’ Treatment.
When writing give your full name and address; be sure to
mention this paper, and enclose Sd. in stamps to cover cost of
postage. The Trial Bottle will be sent you by return mail,
together with a copy of my new and interesting booklet: “Catarrh
—its Cause, Symptoms and Treatment.”

“Heave ho”: The 8.1.’s new tug Coringa
has just put up a fine performance—almost
a record for this part of the world. It.
passed a line - aboard the disabled Cairnhill
at Namatamai, in the German Archipelago,
on July 9, and pointed its nose for Australia.
What with heavy weather, the foul con-
dition of the Cairnhill (it had been lying
with a snapped tail-shaft since March) and
the SOOO tons of phosphates. and coal on
board, the first 500 miles glided past at the
rate of 2.S knots per hour. Finer weather
then fell out of the packet of samples and
the next 800 miles were done at four knots.
Townsville was reached on July 26, and
given reasonable conditions it was reckoned
that they would tie up to Sydney about
August 12. The only better tow that I re-
member was from Broome (W.A.) to Syd-
ney, via Torres Strait, in ’99. The Flinders,
an Adelaide co.’s tug, struggled with the
Serina, which had been bought from the
underwriters for a song. And it may not
have been a better tow, either; for though
the pull was longer there was no dead
weight aboard and the weather devils were
asleep.
“Ricardo”: Sydney and Melbourne, stand
up! The 173rd lesson is to begin. For the
past year London County Council’s Tram-
ways show a deficiency of £BB,OOO, after the
statutory charges have been paid. This is
the first year to end with any deficiency at
all! So much for the war which foolish
authority allowed Private Enterprise to wage
with the public through the motor-’bus. Of
the debt of £12,000,000 London has paid off
less than £8.500,000, and has been mad
enough to allow a tricky lot of private capi-
talists to play havoc with the assets repre-
senting the still-unpaid lOU for £8,500,000.
Sydney and Melbourne, go back to your
places— -and don't moke fools of yourselves.
* * * *
“Briner”: The German commercial navy
has the finest sailing vessels in the world,
trading - between Hamburg and South
America chiefly. They are manned by none
but Germans —crews such as used to be in
our Australasian clippers, like the Sovereign
of the Seas. Lightning. Red Jacket and
R'angatikei. Such of these vessels as hap-
pen to be on the ocean will be in grave
danger, for Britain lias a svvarm of cruisers
not required in the North Sea, where the
business is mainly for Dreadnoughts. The
commercial steam,er can trust much to her
heels. If there is smoke on the horizon she
is off, and the stern chase, with steam in
both, is long. With a sailer the case is very
different. What may happen to Germany,
once Britain masters the sea, may be
guessed at from the fact that the then
rapidly-growing United States commercial
navy was ruined by the Civil War. and in
nearly half a century has recovered but
little, the trade having gone to the British
and German flags. Now, the Americans
are out to grab it from the Germans. So
the whirligig of time brings its revenges.
“Carbon”: Sydney and Newcastle com-
mercial men were thrown into a state of
anti-hallelujah on August 7. when a notifica-
tion was issued by the Customs that coal
was not to be carried coastwise. The notice
posted up read : “Articles prohibited include
Sacks, Coal, Silk Thread, Silk Braid,” etc.
For three hours the Customs Houses in
Sydney and Newcastle were in a state of
siege. Arrangements were about to com-
mence to lay up the collier fleet and close
some of the mines, when a bright official
discovered that two small signs had been
omitted. The notice should have read:
“Sacks (coal), Silk Thread.” etc. When
the error was corrected the coal-dealing
community went out and had a drink and
holders of gas shares countermanded their
orders to sell. But it was a torrid three
hours while it lasted.
* * * *
“jVloana” : The West Coast of Maoriland
is inhaling great quantities of hope because
a company, with much Sydney cash behind
it, is about to put a powerful gold dredge on
the Aliaura River. The vessel, which has
been working on the Macquarie River, is a
50-li.p. plant wfitli 7ft. buckets, and is capa-
ble of lifting and treating 16,000 cubic yards
per week. During the last M.L. dredging
boom a small and inefficient struggler worked
this claim, and in three years took
out £lO.OOO worth of metal. As this baby
mammoth was incapable of breaking the
ground in any quantity or doing anything
like justice to the claim, big things are ex-
pected of the new plant, which is a full-
grown mammoth. The Aliaura River cuts
a belt of gold-bearing country which, during
the boom, supported four dredges and yielded
over £400,000 worth of sovereigns. If the com-
pany succeeds, it contemplates building three
more dredges to scratch the ground. At pre-
sent it is brimming with confidence in the
future. The trouble is that the future has
such a horrible habit of turning out dark and
dismal and filled with cursing.
« * * *
“Knocks” : The world is turning to gall in
the mouth of the Colonial Sugar Co. The
taste was bad enough when the Australian
cast out the colored laborer from the north-
ern eanefields. Still, the gentle Fijian
remained to the co. as a sweet savor. But
now the sweet savor has turned sour and
told the horrified co. that it wants five bob
a shift for handling cargo by day, and ten
bob —ten bob —if the w T ork is done at night.
Ten bob for a nigger! Alas it is true: in
its agony the co. discovers that the Fijian is
a nigger.
* * * *
“Hamer”: Prison administration in
N.S.W. is a completely changed thing, and
it badly wanted to be changed. On the
North Coast an area has been set aside for
tree-planting by prisoners, and the experi-
ment has proved such a success that the
Government is extending the programme by
the purchase of an area at Emu Plains,
where prisoners are to be put to work grow-
ing fruit and vegetables for the public in-
stitutions. The gaol loafer is, in fact,
threatened with utter abolition. Already
the man who goes to prison on account of
his disregard for domestic obligations is not
suffered to waste his time in idleness: he is
put to work, and a portion of the money he
earns goes to the suonort of his neglected
family—the sanest thing in penal reform
ever attempted.

Why suffer from Eczema? Why toss on your bed at
night, and scratch your burning skin? Although Eczema is
the most common of all skin diseases, and often results from
a trifling exposure to heat or cold, do not under-estimate its danger. It often
becomes chronic, causes dreadful suffering and disfigurement, and even blindness,
deafness or loss of hair.
Rexona, the Rapid Healer, is a dire enemy to Eczema, as well as to all other
skin diseases. Rexona will make your skin healthy, destroy the germs of the
disease for ever, and cause the building-up of new skin tissue. A hot bath with
Rexona Soap, gently anointing with Rexona Ointment—a pleasant treatment.
Result: Sleep quietly, skin soothed and healed, while soon all trace of the disease
leaves you. You are healthy. Eczema yields to the powerful healing influence of
Rexona, the Rapid Healer.
MR. I). (JAMHUGS
(From a photo.)
“I have been troubled very much
with Eczema on the leg, and have
used many preparations, but derived
no benefit therefrom,” writes Mr. D.
Cameron, 2!) Ann Street, Roslyn,
Dunedin, N.Z. “Hearing of your
Rexona Ointment and its healing vir-
tues, S gave it a trial, and I am
pleased to say that, after using a
number of so-called cures, I at last
found a quick and reliable remedy in
Rexona Ointment. It took away all
the irritation, inflammation, itching,
and soothed and healed a bad case of
Eczema that was causing me a great
deal of worry and much pain. I can
honestly recommend your Rexona
Ointment as a rapid and reliable
remedy to any person suffering from
the above complaint.”
Rexona, the new Rapid Healing Ointment, is particularly designed to remove
Eczema and other kindred skin a flections, and is an unsurpassed preparation for
this purpose. Rexona promptly allays the irritation and itching, taking a\vav the
desire to scratch the parts affected, quickly dries up any pus or exuding matter,
eases the ache and pain, and. being a germicide of the highest order, promptly
destroys all germs and bacteria, building up at the same time new skin tissues
and cells, so that in the end a new and perfect skin is formed where the disease
formerly existed. Rexona is sold only in triangulai tins, at 1/b ami •>/

A Ballad of the Purple
Parramatta.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BN the purple Parramatta, where the
nascent morning dawns
Over dun-brown - boiling-down works
and grey wool-scouring lawns,
•Just beyond the classic bone-nulls built by
Alley, Pose & Co.,
Dwelt the hero of this poem, James Adolphus
Pummeloe.
James Adolphus was a simple, kindly, lanky
sort of chap,
)\ itli a vacuous expression and a nose shaped
like a tap ;
At the early age of twenty James Adolphus
got a job
A ith the Parramatta Council, under sub-
inspector Blobb.
Mister Blobb, the sub-inspector was a very
solemn man,
\N ho took life in deadly earnest on the
strictest Baptist plan ;
He was trusted by the Council —solemn per-
sons always are;
And he sub-inspected strongly in a dinky
motor-car.
Almost everything that cluttered Parramatta
Mister Blobb
Sub-inspected once fortnightly ; for, you see,
it was liis job;
And wherever it might happen Mister Blobb
might choose to go
He was always sure to carry James Adol-
phus Pummeloe.
In the long, hot, dusty summer of a recent
year of grace,
Parramatta, once historic, grew a most
hysteric place ;
For there came a Mighty Odor —an Objec-
tionable Smell —
Which persisted and insisted till the people
felt unwell.
'Twas a wonderful ha!it an —penetrating,
silent, strong,
Yet elusive and . diffusive like an operatic
song;
It was also highly complex, chromotropic,
yet obscure;
And it shared the gift old loans have —it
seemed able to endure.
When the Mayor and Council smelled it —as
they did in course of time —
They requested the police-force to investigate
the crime,
Which (they said) they felt had happened
somewhere in their happy town ;
And the Mayor said, with great feeling,
’twas an insult to the Crown!
For the supposititious corpse the force
looked all in vain ;
• Every morning Parramatta smelled the
Same Old Smell again ; /
And complaints poured in from Robinson.
and likewise Smith and Jones,
Sarcastically hinting that the Mayor should
shift his bones.
After frequent consultations, cogitations and
remarks —•
Also “lively” Council meetings—and the
searching of the parks,
Gardens, back-yards, drains and foreshores
of the municipal bound
It was solemnly decided that the Smell could
not be found.
Then the patience of the townsfolk, greatly
tried, at last gave way;
And they formed a deputation to approach
the Mayor and say
That the thing was gettiug boresome; some-
one had to do the job ;
And his Worship pronmtly answered: “Send
for sub-inspector Blobb !”
When that solemn sub-inspector, with his
Baptist face and air.
Stood before the troubled Council it was
promptly to declare
That the only course to follow was to show
a contrite heart.
And repent them of their sins, and vow to
make another start.
But, although some half-applauded, it was
very quickly guessed
By the Council that the problem that way
wouldn’t go to rest:
The position called for action —here an
alderman arose
And suggested the employment of a man
who had a nose.
“Ret him take a skiff and follow every wind-
ing of the creek”—
fSaicL that fertile-minded alderman) —“e’en
though it take a week.
If he rows about the river for a month or
two lie’s bound
To locate this horrid odor — and ire'll pro-
secute when found.”
Great applause met the suggestion; but.
which man should do the job?
Some said. “Leave it to flit- Mayor!” Others
mentioned Mister Blobb :
But that worthy sub-inspector under inspi-
ration's glow
1 Cried. “I know the man. yer Washup—James
Adolphus Pummeloe!”
Straight they sent for James Adolphus;
when the Council saw his nose
It was felt that here was one who could the
mystery disclose; '
And without a day's delay they fitted out a
skiff for James
And despatched him on his mission to dis-
cover smells and shames.
Past the bone-mills of his boyhood—past the
soap works paddled he;
Past the spntie tanks and gasworks, and the
new fell monger y :
Past the tannery owned by Flannery, and Ihe
glueworks. in tin 1 glow
Of the rosy-crested sunset paddled .T. A.
Pummeloe.
Gallant soul! lie never faltered in liis hard,
smellifluous task ;
No—not even when he reached the spot
where very dead dogs bask.
And the ancient fish lies sleeping in the
Parramatta ooze—
Alas! he failed; though now he'd find, and
now, again, he'd lose.
Sore spent and baffled oft he rowed, his tap-
shaped nose spread wide
To catch the quaint effluvia that meandered
o’er the tide ;
In vain! That complex and elusive Odor of
tile heat
Completely puzzled faithful James; in short,
it had him beat!
And so he gave it up? Not he! No, no!
Good, faithful lad ;
At duty's oar for evermore he rows and rows
like mad :
Where the purple Parramatta in the rosy
sunset glows
You’ll see Adolphus Pummeloc with elevated
nose.

When the War Started.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HENRY SEA BOTTOM had never
troubled himself about the fabled
world that was supposed by religious
mermen to exist in a dry fashion miles above
his head. As a prominent sandlord and
alderfish, Henry had a reputation to uphold,
lie did not want his fellow-mermen to get
the idea that his head was filled with vague
and unprofitable speculations about other
worlds. It was well enough for curate-fish
and sea-astronomers to go about with their
mouths open —that was their job. Bui
Henry classed himself as a practical fish, with
investments and sand to look after, and lie
never allowed his mind to wander from
those subjects, not even when he was swim-
ming to church with his belltopper gleaming
phosphoresccntly and his family wriggling
behind him.
Henry had a nice house in Sea Channel, a
suburb where the sea-serpent service was
good. If he missed the 8.45 serpent to town,
be simply sat on his tail, opened his Morn-
ing Cuttlefish, and waited for the 8.50.
In fact, there were so many serpents (some of
them swimming express) that his acquaint-
ance with the time-table was very limited.
His friends, too, were numerous, weighty
and of regular habits; and he found that, by
varying his serpents judicimisly, he could
manage to have a chat with everyone once a
fortnight, and thereby gain a good first-hand
knowledge of what was going forwaul. liis
whole life was oidered in this careful
manner, for Henry Seabottom was not the
sort of oyster to miss any chances, however
small. lie was generally regaided by his
business associates as being as keen as a
swordfish, and was revered accordingly; but
the curate-fish, though very grateful for his
numerous donations of shell to the church,
used to heave bubbling sighs of regret when-
ever Mrs. Seabottom spoke with regret of
her husband's preoccupation with the world
about him. The constant cry of the curate-
fish was, "I wish he could be given a Sign!
I cannot help fretting about him, Mrs. Sea-
bottom, because 1 have a sincere regard for
him. The sea would be a Better Place if we
had more fish like him!” Despite all this,
Henry continued to be preoccupied with his
sand sales and talked business with his pals
on the morning and evening sea-serpent.
Henry had one child, a daughter, who was
tin apple of his protruding eye. He wor-
shipped the very sand she swam over, and
worshipfully swallowed the bubbles that
marked her track. He gave her everything
she wanted —all but the useless young poet-
fish who used to call round in the evenings
and read the wild romantic nonsense he had
composed about fights in other worlds and
still, speechless, staring things with two
tails apiece who drifted down from the
water-sky and lay about until removed by the
ancient town council at considerable expense.
The poet-fish, himself, lialt'-believed in these
things, and, of course. Henry’s girl thought
they were simply lovely. But Henry him-
s< If thought the writing of such imaginative
nonsense a criminal waste of time. The
impudence of a fish of the kind aspir-
ing to his daughter sometimes moved him to
such a pitch of fury that he was unable to
sit quietly in the parlor, opening and shutting
his mouth, but had to swim quickly to and
fro. Henry would have been hard put to it
to conceal his delight if the evening poet-fish
had been taken by a shark, or run over and
killed by the sea-serpent. Once, indeed, he
nearlv ordered him to swim out of the house
and never lighten his door phosphorescent!? 7
again. Only a tearful appeal by bis wife
prevented him from taking this extreme
measure. She reminded him that, after all.
lie was only trying to secure bis daughter's
happiness. Why ruin it by turning out this
foolish young fish, who might possibly become
sensible in time? Henry, like a reasonable
fish, yielded, and even managed to contain
himself while the poet fish fastened
on to him and started to tell him
how the fabled drowned men with two
tails who had cqme down from tlx' water-sky
in the long ago had been bound about
the chests with polished steel. With a'dmir-
able self-restraint, he curtly told the foolish
young poet-fish to keep all such observations
for his daughter, who was young and could
be imposed on. For himself, he was just a
practical fish, and the less nonsense fish
talked the better he liked them. From that
time on. the young poet-fish, whenever he
encountered Henry Seabottom. talked sand-
sales exclusively: and. although he didn’t
talk verv brilliantly on that line. Henry met
him half-way and condescended to instruct
him and be very boring. But once in the
drawing-room (or drawing-pool) the poet-
fish would commence again with his
legends, and Henry’s daughter would fall
into a sort of trance and admire the poet-
fish's eyes.
One morning Henry Seabottom discovered
that the kitchen chimney was blocked up.
At first glance it doesn’t look the sort of thing
that shoubl change the whole course of a
merman’s life, upset all his carefully matured
views, and drive him out of his intellectual
trenches. But the fact remains. Tim block-
ing up of Henry’s chimney was the beginning
of the end of him. He investigated with the
longest household ladder, and. after much

When a Woman has Backache, Headache, Rheumatic Twinges,
Urinary Trouble; when she has Aching Limbs and Swo)!en Joints,
WEAK KIDNEYS ARE THE CAUSE.
A woman has more than her share of burdens in life.
The care of the house, the needs of the family, the making
and mending —and constant anxiety for everybody round —
except herself.
It is not surprising that women are subject to kidney
weakness —their kidneys cannot stand the strain that’s forced
upon them.
Backache from morn till night, worn and tired before
mid-day with headache, dizziness —to stoop is painful, and to
rise again is torture.
Sallowness, weak heart, sleeplessness, sciatica, rheuma-
tism, dropsy, gravel, stone are outcomes of diseased and tired
kidneys.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills act diredlly upon the
kidneys —they help them to filter the blood—to take out the
uric acid and impurities that cause the aching back —they
give relief in cases of dropsy, heart palpitation, neuralgia,
lumbago, rheumatism, sciatica, stone, gravel and all urinary
ailments.
•• Every Picture

SYDNEY WOMAN CURED.
Mrs. A. G. Cox. lIS Walker Street, Redfern, says“ For a long
time I suffered from kidney trouble, the worst symptoms being severe
pains in my back, bad headaches, dizzy attacks, disordered secretions, and
a dull, tired feeling that I could not shake off. The pain in my back
was often almost unbearable, and every movement seemed to increase
my sufferings. As time went on I got worse instead of better, nothing
I took doing me the least good. I was really far from well, and badly in
need of a medicine that would cure me. At last I heard of Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, so I got a bottle to try them. They, proved to
be the very thing I wanted, for after taking three bottles of these Pills
I was quite cured, and I have had no return of kidney trouble since. I
am sure sufferers cannot do better than take Doan's Backache Kidney
Pills ; what this remedy has done for me it will do for others.”
Two years later, Mrs. Cox says:—“My cure has proved a permanent
one, for I have not had a sign of kidney trouble since Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills cured me two years ago.”
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are sold by all Chemists and Store-
keepers at 2s. 9d. per bottle, or will be posted on receipt of price by
Foster-McClellan Co., 76 Pitt Street, Sydney.

A Lasting Cure by
DOAN’S OINTMENT .
Mr. Joseph Abrahams, 25 Bourke Street, Redfern, Sydney, says:—“For twenty-
five years I have been tortured with Itching Files. The pain and irritation of this
ailment are terrible, and only those who have suffered know what an awful complaint
it is. I used dozens of Bile remedies, but could not get anything to give me ease. 1
never expected to get a cure for Biles. A friend urged me to try Doan's Ointment,
saying he was sure this preparation would cure me. i got some, and commenced using
it," and in a very short time I was completely cured. I shall be pleased to personally
verify this should any sufferer call on me.”
Three years later, Mr. Abrahams says:—-“I- have not been troubled with Biles
since Doan’s Ointment cured me over three years ago. I have advised many sufferers
to use this, grand remedy, and 1 am sure it will cure in every case if people will only
apply it properly.”
Doan's Ointment is sold by all Chemists and Storekeepers at 2 9 per pot,
or post free by Foster-McClellan Co., 76 Pitt Street, Sydney.
trouble, got a purchase on a boot and hauled,
out a perfect stranger who tallied in nearly
every way with the descriptions supplied by
the mentally crippled poet-fish. Every scale
on Henry’s tail stood up on end with horror
and astonishment. He had acquired the very
thing he had always denounced as impossible
and absurd, and the fish who would probably
laugh loudest was the one for whom he had
the most profound contempt. Balanced pre-
cariously on his tail on the top rung of the
laddei’,. and with the dreadful exhibit waving
beside him, lie asked himself a series of
questions. The first question was: “Am I
mad?’’ That got a hearty negative, for
Henry Seabottom’s belief in his own sanity
was tremendous. The next question was:
“Is it real?” After furtively considering It
from all angles, Henry muttered, “I don’t
believe it is!” Then he drew himself up,
opened his mouth and bubbled, “Who put
this effigy in the chimney?” The answer at
once stx’eamed into his mind: “That d —d
poet!” Looking hurriedly around to make
certain that no fish had seen him, he
descended the laddei-, concealed the body in
the weedshed, and went off, bubbling ven-
geance, to look for his px-actical joker.
As Henry swam down the street to the
sea-serpent station, he promised himself that
he would do something serious to the accursed
poet-fish when he caught him. But his fury
cooled somewhat when he remembered that
it was just the sort of thing the poet-fish
wouldn't do. If the Thing at home in the
weedshed wasn’t i*eal, then it was a wondei’-
ful imitation, and the poet-fish must be either
rich or industrious —and Henry knew he was
neither. What if Mrs. Seabottom should
chance to swim out to the weedshed and
discover it! Henry had almost decided to
go back and stow it away when he recol-
lected that it was washing day at home. He
swam on in a hot perspiration, carefully
avoiding the eye of the local sergeant-fish,
who was waggling his fins in an idle manner
at the street cornei\ He pui'cliased his
Mobning Cuttlefish as usual, but, during
the journey into town, it lay unopened on
his lap. The Thing in the shed at home
was becoming more realistic every minute,
and, by the time the sea-serpent ran into the
central station the mild poet-fish he
had set out to discover and assail
was the very last fish he wanted to
meet. He decided to buy theatre
tickets for his entii-e family for that evening,
and have the Thing removed and buried
befoi-e they got home again. He sighed with
relief when he thought how near he had
been to unbosoming himself to the half-witted
and unreliable poet-fish. Suppose he had
rushed like a fool to that babbling idiot and
revealed bis dreadful secret? Why, the news
would have been all over town in an hour,
and he would have been humiliated and pro-
bably ruined ! .
Before Henry swam into his town office
he composed his face (Henry was no
musician, but he could compose his own face
twice a day if necessary), and waited till
his tail had slowed down to a dignified beat.
Then he swirled in and bumped into his
partner Ray, who had a paper and seemed
excited.
“See the special edition?” asked Ray.
Henry said he hadn’t.
“Here you are, then ! They’ve discovered
a merman with two tails! What's the
matter?”
Henry sank into his chair and buried his
face in his chest-fins : “I—l’m not well!.. ..
Where did they”
“Out here in the street! It’s the greatest
discovei-y of the age. Fish are fighting to
see it!”
Henry was a fish of great recupei-ative
powers. He was also a fish of iron will.
He had ironed out too many fish not to know
an opportunity when he saw it. He rose on
his tail-tip and struck an attitude.
“Feel better?” queried his partner.
Henry blew a few bubbles with his mouth
and made his scales sparkle. “Well,” he
said, “I don’t need to fight to see their
double-tailed merman. I’ve got one at home
in the weedshed!”
His partner wriggled forward and shot his
eyes out. “Where did you get it?”
But Henry did not give away secrets easily
like that. He liked to make other fish stand
off and say he was a Marvel. “Never you
mind ! I’ve not only got one of my own,
but I know a young fish who can tell you
more about these things than any other fish
in town !” Then, in order that some shark
should not get in ahead of him and secure
the young fish-poet, he took his hat and said
condescendingly to his partner: “Come along
and I’ll introduce you to him.” And his
partner, who was frightfully interested, and
loved a free treat, bubbled gratefully:
“Thanks, I’d love to!” They hurried out
together, only pausing at the Giant Clam
Safe Deposit to get some papers Ray had
left thei’e.
The young fish-poet wms found at last in
a library doing something particularly use-
less; but Henry Seabottom greeted him no
less warmly on that account. He had col-
lected a few of his best friends as he pro-
gressed and they made an impressive depu-
tation. all of them being fish of great bulk.
The young poet-fish drew back when he first
saw the mass of respectability advancing in
close formation; but when Henry had ex-
plained their mission, he wrung his fins with
pleasui-e and swam off at top speed with them
in close pursuit. They wei’e lucky enough
to just get a through sea-serpent and were
quickly landed on Henry’s home-station.
But, as they approached his home, they saw
that, the house was surrounded by a large
and glittering collection of excited fish.
They forced their way through the press to
the inner cordon of police-fish; and there
they found what all the trouble was about.
The merman had been found and was lying
of the verandah in full view of the street!
Several police-fish had it in charge and were
arguing as to what they should do with it.
Mrs. Seabottom was distractedly blowing
bubbles and wringing her fins with shame
and confusion, while her daughter was clap-
ping her fins with delight and proclaiming
that “Herbert must be told at once.” When
Herbert burst from the crowd, she swam to
his side like a flash and led him, wriggling
with pleasure, to the prostrate exhibit.
“There you are, dear! It’s all come true —
every word that you said! Father won’t
ever be rude to you again !”
They bent lovingly over the strange,
silent, pale thing with the strange red
opening in its chest. Henry took
chai-ge in his accustomed manner. As
an experienced aldei-fish, he knew how to
make impromptu speeches about things of
which he knew nothing; and this was too
good an opportunity to be missed. It was
a splendid speech. Henry took up the atti-
tude of a public benefactor who had just
made a valuable contribution to science and
wanted to remain anonymous—or as anony-
mous as possible under the circumstances.
He mentioned in a tremendous voice that he
didn’t want his name mentioned and that
wimt he had done had been done without
any thought of gain. (Loud applause.) He
handed over this unique specimen—this deni-
zen of another world —he handed it over
without reservation of any kind to the
State. (Tremendous cheering.) He consid-
ered that in doing so he was only doing his
duty. (“No, no!” and “Yes!”) lie con-
sidered that every fish should do his duty.
(Cheers.) And he knew that every fish
there would do his duty when the time came.
(Deafening applause.) But for himself—
(More cheering for himself) —for himself he
was quite satisfied to have the love and
esteem of his fellow-fish. (Hear, hear!)
And now he would call upon his young friend
Mr. Sofafish to give them the benefit of his
wide and unrivalled knowledge of the world
from which this wonderful —this uniquely
wonderful—specimen had come. (Great
cheering.) His dear friend and associate,
Mr. Sofafish, had devoted the best part of his
life to this fascinating study, and he was
sure they would listen to him with the
greatest attention. (Cheers.) He thanked
them once again for their touching expres-
sions of confidence and good-will, and assured
them that he would not accept the slightest
rewai’d from the State for the specimen—no
matter what its value might be. (Loud
cheers.) As reoresentatives of the State
there assembled, he presented them with the
specimen. (Roars of joy.)
Mr. Sofafish wriggled forward and faced
the cheering thousands. He was just about
to open his mouth when something drifted
slowly down from the sky and settled before
him on the sandy front garden. It was another
specimen exactly like the one on the veran-
dah ! The crowd roared again, and swayed
to and fro. Henry Seabottom rose up on
his tail and stared. Sofafish bubbled with
insane joy and claimed it. as being nearest
to it when it fell. And those were the last
words that were heard for some time, for at
that instant specimens in hundreds came
twisting and writhing down from the sky,
and it was a spry young fish that didn’t get
a few scales knocked off through being
bumped by the heavy, helpless things. The
temper of the fish ci’owd changed in an in-
stant, and instead of roailng applause it
screamed with anger and derision. Henry
Seabottom and Sofafish waved their fins on
the verandah and tried to explain ; but they
might as well have tried to explain to a herd
of mad whales. Old and furious fish could
be heard denouncing Henry as a humbug
for solemnly presenting rubbish to the State,
and young fish ui'ged him to go and get
netted. These remarks were screamed at
them as they watched from shelter the
frightened crowd dodging the bundles that
came hurtling down by twos and threes and
discoloring the water. Sofafish (a fool to
the last) was trying to tell old Henry some
old myth about legendary beings who lived
up in another world where all was dry and
hot and no mortal fish could exist, and how
these beings or gods sometimes fought one
another with iron and fire (fire was the
stuff they fried the moiming bacon with, in-
stead of drowning it in a pot fish-fashion)
and how, when these gods or devils were
killed at sea (sea wasn’t their element, but
they went on it for some silly reason), they
couldn’t swim, and that this shower showed
thex-e was a fight away up in the next world.
All this and much more the half-witted Sofa-
fish screamed into the gills of his beloved’s
father, instead of firing on the family cuttle-
fish and obscuring the issue sufficiently to
enable the Seabottom family and liimseif to
escape the frenzied mob. The consequence
was that Henry Seajbottom and he had to
stand at bay until an enormous shadow
scared away the mob in one glittering rush.
Sofafish and Henry, being two different sorts
of fools, didn’t take the cue, but instead
stayed to ask each other what the matter
was. And the delay was fatal, for next
instant the warship that had been sunk in
action settled down cx-ushingly on the house
and all in it. The others were killed
instantly. But Henry lingered long enough
to have a few words with the first rescue
party. He said he had never done any harm
to any fish, and that the sea was becoming
unfit to live in. And then he died in it.
Moral: Some of our present misfortunes may
be passed on.

LEADING SEAMAN.
My Standpoint.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THIS gay old giddy world of ours
Is full of joy and beer and flowers;
And beer, or joy, or flowers I choose,
Uncaring who these things refuse ;
And yet a man who next door houses
Looks o’er my fence at me and wowses.
This wowser filled with holy wx-ath,
Abjures my pleasures. Life is froth;
I am Content to take a drop
Which bears its only froth on top,
But this man never yet I've chided
Because he did not do as I did.
I do not look across his fence
With piety as my pretence
For interference in his cheer,
And urge him to indulge in beer,
Or shun the dangers of the choir,
And fix his thoughts on something higher.
If I should slumber at his door,
And kill his rest with song or snoi’e,
Or drop a flounder in his milk,
Or any. way his pleasure bilk,
lie has his remedy in storming.
But I resent his d —d reforming.
Some day I’ll meet him in a lane,
And, holding him by might and main,
Will pour his holy gullet down
Some seven pints of liquor brown.
To show I know will be my labor
His sense of duty to a neighbor.

The importance of efficient insulation, in many cases, is not realised. Great
care is shown in the selection of a steam plant to ensure the greatest economy,
yet the insulation which is of equal importance is in many cases partly neg-
lected. If you strive to make a saving in the steam consumption of your
engine, why not make certain that it is not wasted again through faulty in-
sulation? The claims we make as to the exceptional efficiency of Newall’s
Coverings are fully borne out by actual test, and, further, by the enormous
sales, including repeat orders, and we do not know of a single instance where
any other covering has been used once Newall’s have been tried.
The Ultimo and White Bay Power Houses are insulated throughout with
Newall’s Coverings, and this material has also been adopted exclusively by the
N.S.W. and Victorian Governments. These are facts which will tend to fur-
ther prove our claims. The innumerable advantages of this material over all
other forms of lagging are described in interesting booklet, which we will be
pleased to mail you • along with samples.
