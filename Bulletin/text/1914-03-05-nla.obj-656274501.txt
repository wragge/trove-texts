Flat Roofs are an economy. Very few large city buildings have been
erected of late years without them. Enquire round the Capital Cities
and you’ll be surprised how many. While enquiring how many, ask
how many are Malthoid. You’ll be surprised a second time—unless
you know how most architects swear by Malthoid; then you’ll be
prepared, of course. Malthoid Flat Roofs are recommended by the best
architects because they are absolutely dependable. They’re watertight
and weathertight ; they’ll stand any amount of traffic, and they rarely,
if ever, call for repairs. May we send you Booklets and Samples ?
If you live in any of the capitals may we send a man to chat with you ?

The Red Page
The Female
Ahis fuss in England about votes for
females sounds futile over here. If English
females want a vote, why don’t they come
over here, where votes are plentiful and
cheap? Why spoil golf-links and pillar-
boxes, why shriek and starve for a single
vote apiece, when Australia offers them
almost as many votes as any spinsterette
can desire? If the Unspankedhursts want
votes, in Australia they could have 12 votes
apiece. In the last Federal election they
could have had three votes for the Senate, a
fourth for the House, and six more for the
Referenda. Then in the recent N.S.W.
State election they could have had two votes
apiece, one for their candidate and one for
local option, with the sporting chance of
another vote on the second ballot. Surely a
dozen votes, @r a baker’s dozen, should be
sufficient for any spinsterette? And if the
double dissolution be granted, at the next
Federal election the female will have an
three votes for the legislature. Why
doesn’t the whole boiling of spinsterettes in
England emigrate to a continent rather
lonely for women, or why doesn’t the British
Government imitate South Africa and deport
the lot? We’d have them : we’d have anybody
white. And a rather troublesome squabble
in England would be settled quite cheaply;
and when the spinsterettes became Ainitea-
lians they would see that even 12 votes
leave their possessors not one penny the
worse. _ It is remotely possible that some of
the spinsterettes might get married and
boost the Australian birth-rate.
The notable, almost inconceivable, thing
about the books written, chiefly by women,
on the female question in England, is that
their authors never take the trouble to in-
vestigate this paradise of votes. They go on
arguing for or against the vote —beautiful
arguments and gorgeous hypotheses—as if the
vote , for females were something new, even
something unheard of. And when the Un-
spankedhursts flee from a starvation diet,
they go to France, where there are no female
votes, or the United States, where, here and
there, a vote o-r two is given to a female who
doesn’t know in the least what to do with
the awkward thing. They carefully over-
look the continent where votes are given
women by the bucketful, and where nobody
cares what the female does with her votes or
what difference it makes anyway.
J*
Here are five spinsterette books, three
written by females and two by males.* And
all are dull. One wonders whether it is
dullness that drives people into being spin-
sterettes or whether asking for votes makes
people dull. The same conundrum applies
to the anti-spinsterette. Mrs. Colquhoun is
opposed to the demand for the suffrage, but
sees behind it a far deeper and more funda-
mental discontent than can be met by grant-
ing votes to females. Occasionally she
makes a bright feminine suggestion :
As diners, and convives generally, women
are still amateurs, and one cannot help
wishing that they could evolve some new
and congenial form of meeting, in which the
awful formality of a set dinner and the
chances whb o may place one between two
uncoil;?.-! o.: or shy people might be elimi-
l i'-i' O. Set meals and set speeches make no
•special appeal to women....
Matters would be immensely simplified if
one knew beforehand which girls would
marry and which would not —if, in short,
they came into the world labelled. The
uncertainty of their destination complicates
the question of training and education in
what may appear to be a hopeless manner
.... In obedience to the modern theory of
female education, mothers permit their
daughters to be trained for everything but
matrimony.
Mrs. Colquhoun’s aim, heavily expressed,
is to establish the thesis that “women are
women and men are men”—the one thesis
that the spinsterette repudiates, though there
are other people, many of them males, who
think that there may be something after all
in such a hypothesis. The only chapter of
interest in her book deals with the sugges-
tion that the superfluous female in Britain,
where the males are in a minority of over a
million, should be dumped into Australia,
where the males predominate.
The fundamental objection to any such
scheme is that the character of our overseas
dominions, their rapid advance and success,
has been due to the fact that they were
populated by a particular class of man and
woman—a class in which energy and the
spirit of adventure were strong... .We want
as far as possible to ensure that the stream
which passes from us to them is inspired
by this spirit.... a stream of individual
pioneer women to match the men who go out
every year in increasing numbers to lands
where they can hardly hope to find a mate
....Can we find in modern (British) edu-
cation? . .. any trace of the idea that some
of the girls who pass through it are destined
for such a 1ife?....1t is doubtful whether
we are rearing, especially in the much edu-
cated class, a type of woman physically
fitted for the strain of domestic labor plus
child-bearing which life in a new country
involves for women.
Surely the spinsterette belongs to a class
“in which energy and the spirit of adventure
are strong”?
Mrs. Swanwick runs over the same
ground. The female, she explains, is craving
two things, knowledge and scope. “Women,
as well as men, should have the fullest pos-
sible opportunities for development, not be-
cause they are ‘equal’ to men, but because it
is good business, socially speaking, to de-
velop all your human as well as your
material resources.” Besides, “if man be
really the intellectual superior of woman,
why should he fear her competition?” But
does he? The male may be the intellectual
superior of the dog, but does he fear the
competition of the trained poodle? But
Mrs. Swanwick is unfemininely fair; hers
is no shrill scream for woman’s rights. For
instance, she disclaims altogether “the kind
of assumption that one frequently finds im-
plicit in much of the feminist talk of the
present day—the assumption that men have
been the barbarians who loved physical force,
and that women alone were civilised and
civilising. If men have enjoyed fighting, and
gloried in bloodshed, as many still do, that
is because their blood was hot within them,
and the women of their age and race loved
them for it.” And the author does not
altogether shut her eyes to the fact that there
are countries where votes for women—even
bucketsful of votes for women —are accom-
plished facts. She quotes Australia and
Norway in refutation of the cry that votes
for women will “feminise” a country. And
she admits that where the vote has been
given females'it has not much affected the
balance of parties; “that is to say, it has
not had just that element of fighting that
so interests the sensation lover and that is
so fundamentally contrary to real progress.
There has been n 0.... sex-war, but politics
have been peacefully penetrated by the
women’s point of view.” A just pronounce-
ment.
In her consideration of the economic
problem, too, Mrs. Swanwick is outspoken:
No discussion of the economic position of
women would be honest which did not take
into account the undoubted fact that women
can make more money by the sale of their
bodies than in any other way... .Kings have
given their mistresses titles, and have made
their sons peers. How many other women
have been ennobled for any other services?
While a first-class university woman rarely
gets a higher salary than £5OO a year, an
illiterate courtesan, if she plays her cards
well and has luck, may dip her hands into
millions Every poor, sweated girl knows
she can in one night double her week’s wage
if she chooses. This is a fact. If we do
not fearlessly face it, we may as well give
up talking about the woman’s movement, for
it will only be play.”
dff the books in this list The Future of
the Women’s Movement is the most inter-
esting and the least unbiassed.
«£*
Walter M. Gallichan, though he tells us
that “happy wedlock is the greatest moralis-
ing influence in society,” that “the battle
of the sexes, in obtaining the means of sus-
tenance, has assumed a menacing aspect,”
and that “a woman constantly mewed up in
the home becomes narrow in her outlook,
irritable, and subject to discontent and de-
pression,” with other dull commonplaces,
fails to tell us how to manage modern
woman. Some female ought to marry Walter
M. Gallichan.
Mrs. St. Clair Stobart was the founder of
a woman’s convoy corps that rendered good
service in the recent trouble in the Balkans.
Her story of this company, composed exclu-
sively of women, which for 10 weeks carried
on a field hospital for the wounded at the
front, and in which the trained women did
everything for themselves, is highly interest-
ing. The Woman’s Convoy Corps had been
trained for four years in England in all
forms of work occurring between the field
hospital and the base. They seiz-ed the oppor-
tunity to put the work to a practical test in
Bulgaria. The author received little assist-
ance from the British Army, which appar-
ently has no use for women nurses- and
doctors. Her experiences in the Balkans
brought home to her that: —
It is an evil thing that men only should
witness the results of war. Wars will
never cease till whatever cost to
themselves —are admitted behind the drop-
curtain, and discover, amongst the card-
board scenery and the grease-paints which
glorify for the public the tragedy of war,
the brutal realities which are the secrets of
those behind the footlights.
Her narrative, therefore, is made the
basis for a strong plea in favor of the ser-
vices of trained women being incorporated
within the British scheme of National De-
fence.
All that need be said about Almroth E.
Wright’s Vnexpurgated Case is thqt he has
written nothing that the wowserest Wowser
could discover to expurgate; and the whole,
flat, dull thing is of value only to remind us
that there are still in existence Tories of
the type that pig-headedly object to pro-
gress, even in Woman. The book has been
written simply because in a letter to Lon-
don Times this doctor caused a little local
fuss by stating that “the mind of woman is
always threatened with danger from the re-
verberations of her physiological emergen-
cies.” And his objection to competi-
tion in his own job is that he wishes to keep
up—as between men and women —even when
they are doctors —“some of the modesties
and reticences upon which our civilisation
has been built up.” Almroth E. Wright is
the finest fossil that the spinsterettes have
yet unearthed. Unfortunately, he is as dull
as they.
•
Much, but not all, of the exuberant per-
sonality of Randolph Bedford has found its
way into Explorations in Civilisation (Syd.
Day, Sydney, Is.). The pursuit of the wild-
cat has led Bedford into many strange
backyards of Europe: he has discovered the
animal amid medieval Italian castles,
has run her to earth through miles of lilies
and irises in bloom, has sought her in mer-
cury mines and in ochre mines, and killed
her in the marble quarries of the Apennines.
But he has brought back something worth
more than wild-cat’s meat: he has brought
back this vivid collection of travel sketches.
The astounding vision of Bedford perspir-
ingly fleeting over the Italian landscape is
less real than that landscape. Literature
is with this Australian a mere by-product:
his wary eye is ever on the disappearing
wild-cat. But this book presents to Aus-
tralian readers a brilliant picture of Old
World civilisations; its peculiar value lies
in the fact that the author takes always
as his standard of comparison or condemna-
tion this Commonwealth of ours. “At the
hotel (in Rome) I looked from my window
into another Romeo and Juliet garden,
flooded by moonlight almost Centralian in
its intensity... .The Tiber is quite as muddy
and about as wide as the Yarra...,The
organ-grinder was a most miserable wretch;
his face as white and weak and despairing
as that of a man I saw hanged in Ballarat
in 1891; and he had wept himself dry, and
had taken two days to do it. .. .How like is
Australia to Italy in atmosphere. There is
in my garden in Grey-street, East Mel-
bourne, a cypress as beautiful as any here,
and as calm —it looks east to the Dande-
nongs, which are lovelier than the Apen-
nines.” Bedford sees the things that other
travellers wish they could see, and that
tourists never see. His humor is contempt-
uous, his naive frankness delightful, and
he tells a story—such as that stirring epic
of the guano trader, the Italian who “was,
amico, very strongly in affairs of the manure
of the fowls” —almost as well as he tells
them, though hardly as picturesquely as he
tells them in a taxi-cab at 4.30 a.m. Mean-
time Australia waits for a novel that will
fulfil the vivid promise of True Eyes and the
Whirlwind and The Snare of Strength. The
Pursuit of the Dago Wild Cat is reprinted
from The Bulletin.
The MS. of South Sea Shipmates (N.S.W.
Bookstall Co.; Is.) was found among the
papers of the late John Arthur Barry,
known to Bulletin readers as the author
of Steve Brown’s Bunyip and The Luck of
the Native Born. These “matter-of-fact ad-
ventures of two Australian sailormen in
various seas, and of ships of varying degrees
of maritime iniquity,” are admirably told,
with little literary art but much sincerity.
Especially delightful is the story of the mem-
bers of the League of Ancient Mariners, aged
captains who h*»d long given up the sea, who
to decide a bet shipped on a Sydney sailing
craft and navigated her, if not to the satis-
faction of the captain, at least to their own
glory; and who got their A.B.’s discharges
with “V.G.” on every one of them, despite a
mutiny on the hieh seas. The book should
appeal to every sailorman.
The anonymous Diary and Other Indiscre-
tions (Harrison, per Angus and Robertson,
Sydney) take the form of a large page diary
for 1914, annotated by epigrams that vary
from fair to middling. Some samples that
may serve to help us on our way through
the year: “A woman’s mistakes are generally
the result of inexperience on her part—and
experience on his... .Nothing ages a woman
so much as the perpetual struggle to remain
32.... The tragedy of life to a middle-aged
woman is not that she is growing ugly, but
that so much of her beauty remains. .. .It
is positively unkind nowadays to say that a
woman is as old as she looks. Women use
powder and paint so freely these days that
they invariably look far older than they
really are....” The author is said to be
E. A. Watt of Sydney.
THE BEGINNING.
“Where have I come from, where did you
pick me up?” ,the baby asked its mother.
She answered half crying, half laughing, and
clasping the baby to her breast —
“You were hidden in my heart as its desire,
my darling.
You were in the dolls of my -childhood’s
games; and when with clay I made the
image of my god every morning, I made
and unmade you then.
You were enshrined with our household
deity, in his worship I worshipped you.
In all my hopes and my loves, in my life, in
the life of my mother you have lived.
In the lap of the deathless Spirit who rules
our home you have been nursed for ages.
’When in girlhood my heart was opening its
petals, you hovered as a fragrance about
it.
Your tender softness bloomed in my youthful
limbs, like a glow in the sky before the
sunrise.
Heaven’s first darling, twin-born with the
morning light, you have floated down the
stream of the world’s life, and at last
you have stranded on my heart.
As I gaze on your face, mystery overwhelms
me; you who belong to all have become
mine.
For fear of losing you I hold you tight to my
breast. What magic has snared the
world’s treasure in these slender arms
of mine?”
Rabindranath Tagore, in The Crescent
Moon (Macmillan).
Rabindranath Tagore, the winner of the
Nobel Literature Prize, does not show in
Sddhand: The Realisation of Life (Mac-
millan ; 55.) any added reason why that
award has been made. If anyone desires to
“come in touch with the ancient spirit of
India as revealed in the sacred texts and
manifested in the life of to-dav.” he may
possibly do so by the aid of these dull essays
on Buddhism. The Crescent Moon (Mac-
millan; 4s. 6d.), a series of prose poems of
childhood, translated by the author from
the original Bengali, lacks the indefinable
appeal of his Song Offerings ( Gitanjali ),
though here and there one finds a charming
echo of the wistful, trance-like meditations
of Gitanjali.
•
Entries for the sonnet on our perspiring
February will close, addressed ho this page,
to-day.
Kipling’s many verses, scattered through
his books of prose, or used as chapter-head-
ings, are collected in his Songs From Books
(Macmillan, per Sydney Book Club). This
miscellaneous collection, in which the occa-
sional snatches of song are in some cases
completed, contains verse of varied quality,
ranging from perfect little things like “A
Charm”- — Take of English earth as much As
either hand may rightly clutch...., to jour-
nalese of the minute like “The Puzzler.” All
the verses display, however, much metrical
and riming ingenuity. The bulk of Kipling’s
work is his chief claim to his renown: much
of this stuff has been bettered by individual
bards, but so much, sustaining so high an
average quality, is an achievement somewhat
rare.
One stanza will suffice to rank Fred Jas. Forrester,
author of Waratah Songs and Poems, first and second
series (W. Brookes, Brisbane; 6d.), in the hier-
archy of Australian poets. It is taken from “Our
Old Chestnut Horse”:—
His points I know cannot stand a test all round,
He has three white legs, rather lanky as well;
But they are strong, firm and sound.
They may bring down his price if we him sell.
But with the good ole horse we will not part,
For he has a kindly eye and a well-shaped head,
He is docile as a lamb ; has a kindly heart;
Can by a ten-year-old child be led,
Quiet is our ole Chestnut Horse.
Verses and Essays, first edition, by J.M.T. (Able,
Dykes, Auckland, M.L., ver W. Dymock, Sydney;
Is.), has this to tell us of the Bottle-O: —
I’m a Bottle O, and oh, and oh,
It’s fine to be a Bottle O!
For don’t yer know, in Bottle 0,
Yer finding treasure high and low.
Bottle O, Bottle o—Oh !
Maybe. This extract is from the verses section. Let
us consider his essays. In “Trees” he remarks:
“What a beautiful invention trees are!” and he
gives us some encouragement in his remarks upon
“Mixed Surf Bathing”: “Surf bathing, though con-
demned and scoffed at by a few prudists, is one of
the most innocent, healthful and enjoyable of all
recreations, and when wisely regulated and controlled
should have every encouragement.” It is evident
that J.M.T. has been plagiarising the editorial
columns of the Sydney Morning Herald. He has
also something as editorial to say upon “Roads’ ;
and this, in another essay, is a valuable contribution
to modern thought:—*-
“How vastly are we in need of new words to
distinguish, for instance, the male and female off-
spring of the lower animals from those of the human
race! Fancy calling the foal of a horse, or the
calf of a cow, a son or a daughter! Is the thought
not nauseous, loathsome, repugnant? Surely we
should find another name for the young of a cow
than that of our own young—or children ! What we
want is more words—nouns and adjectives in par-
ticular.” f L . -
Meantime J.M.T. might make better use of the
nouns and adiectives he’s got. The airy confidence
that J.M.T. displays in mentioning that this is his
first edition—since a first edition presupposes a
second one—is not shared by us.

MODERN MIRACLES
Remarkable Cures by
CLEMENTS TONIC
RECENTLY, in France, a peasant woman, whose little girl had
been bed-ridden with paralysis for years, had occasion to visit a
churchyard which 'contained the statue of a well-known saint.
Some of the mould from the tomb adhered to her handkerchief, which
upon touching her child cured her. This fact is vouched for upon
reliable authority.
Miracles are not all confined to the older countries, for we have
heard also of similar remarkable incidents in newer countries, and very
often in Australia, where only eighteen short months ago a certain
section of Broken Hill was electrified by the recovery from apparently
incurable St. Vitus Dance of the daughter of Mrs. R. A. Addington, of
Argent Street. It was on the 10th October, 1911, when first the
mysterious cure was reported. The mother, being seen by a special
interviewer, and overcome by gratitude that her daughter was healthy
again, told the facts at once. She said that the disorder occurred
through her daughter falling from a tram. This gave her a great
shock, and so affected her nervous system that eventually St. Vitus
Dance ensued. She became so bad that it was impossible to hold a
knife or fork, and going out of the house was impossible. This
remarkable condition continued for some time, medical skill being
useless, Mrs. Addington declared, when suddenly, as the result of using
Clements Tonic, a wonderful change took place. She gradually
improved, and soon regained her normal condition. Nearly two years
have elapsed since her complete recovery, and all that time she has
enjoyed the best of health. “I have great faith in Clements Tonic, and
always recommend it,” added the mother, “and you can make what
use you wish of this.”
It is not strange that miracles should follow the use of this
miraculous medicine. Its cures of weak nerves, insomnia, debility,
sick headache, indigestion and constipation are really remarkable.

THIN WOMEN!
What is more pitiable than a pretty woman whose neck, arms and
scraggy chest destroy her every chance of being really charming?
Nothing gives charm to a woman so much as does a full, well-rounded,
perfectly-developed figure. If you lack it, science will enable you to
obtain it.
WHEN you look into the mirror and your
hollow cheeks, thin neck and scrawny
arms mock even you, what effect do
you suppose they have on those with whom
you mix socially?. .. .A woman’s chief charm
is a well-rounded figure and full bosom. With
these, thin arms and hollow cheeks are a
rarity.
If your bust lacks development, and you
are scraggly and attenuated, we will advise
you free and gladly as to how you may im-
prove your figure and beautify your bust.
We are only too pleased to tell you the
secret, for we know it cannot fail, and that
in a few weeks you will be happier, healthier
and more sought after socially than in your
present undeveloped, emaciated condition.
Thousands of women suffering the ravages
of ill-health have sought and accepted this ad-
vice, and to-day are models of womanly de-
velopment and examples of perfect health.
The same success awaits your call. In the
wake of attenuation follow such complaints
as constipation, indigestion, bilious head-
aches, internal functional derangements, etc.
As your development advances and weight im-
proves, these gradually disappear and perfect
health results.
Every case is accepted under a guarantee
to refund fee if satisfactory results do not
follow the use of the treatment. SEND FOR

Aftermath.
With dim and misty notions, *
While pleasure idled by,
We dallied on Youth’s Highway,
Together, he and I.
We parted at the cross-roads
Each lauding his life’s scheme,
He chose the lioad to Riches
And I the Bath of Dream.
He bade farewell to friendship,
And travelling hard and fast
The shrouded road he’d chosen,
Attained his goal at last.
And there, as he predicted,
Found all his purpose sought—
Vainglory, power and riches,
And all that riches bought.
Among the money-changers
His blood ran fever-high,
With gold he purchased passion.
But Love he could not buy.
For gold he wed a stranger,
And, waxing richer, grew
A stranger to the children
He never prattled to.
And then, the utmost wrested
From fellow-men of gain,
The hour of Youth remembered
He groped for love in vain.
His lonely hearth with ashes
Is white, where once the blaze
Of friendship burned the fragrance
Of tender wooing days.
For pomp and place and plaudit
He sold his heart outright;
He swayed a million people
But never Heart’s Delight.
Prince of the mob that flatters,
He sits in state alone —
Alone with all his grandeur,
Unmoved and cold as stone*
And in his heart strange yearning,
Like yearning of spring flowers,
Heaped on a dead man’s coffin,
For singing, sun-rayed hours.
His hard-won gauds and fardels
Now scarcely worth while seem ;
He rushed the Road to Riches,
I roamed the Path of Dream.

Rising.
Ah, good intentions, and well-meant endea-
vor !
Oh, resolutions formed to last for ever!
Ah, high resolves I make as I awaken,
Of all the habits that must be forsaken
And undertakings to be overtaken!
Oh, blest condition of the early riser,
Who lies down wise, secure of rising wiser—
To-day’s economist, to-morrow’s miser,
Swearing to scrape and save each precious
second
Out of the wreckage hitherto unreckoned.
How comforting that firm determination,
To do to death the thief procrastination,
To sweep the slugs of sloth —the loathsome
lumber,
Out of the morning’s path that they encum-
ber !
And, maybe, to disturb the slavey’s slumber.
Oh, it is pleasant—past the comprehension
Of such as hold at dawn their best intention,
In tent, or under hangings, in suspension—
To stand alone, awake to early virtue,
Conscious that no one will rise up and hurt
you.
Yet are those golden hours of peace un-
spoken
Subject at times to being rudely broken
In ways that resolution’s nerves unsteady—
Like this untimely cry I hear: “Now Teddy!
What are you doing out there?
Breakfast’s ready !”
MAJORCA, SPAIN.
WAIF.
Memory Land.
The sunlight gilded leaf and frond,
There woke a vagrant breeze
That wrecked the startled ships of mist
Upon the mountain’s knees,
And a bell-bird called the matins from
The temple of the trees.
’Twas there I saw the turquoise smoke,
Above the golden corn,
Go up against the purple hills
As incense to the morn,
As though to Heaven by angel hands
Some fairy scarfe were borne.
The bullock teams among the spurs
Like crippled pythons crept,
The groaning wheels that bit the stones
Their plaint of anguish kept,
And swift as master swordsman’s steel
The raw-hide whip-thong leapt.
From dawn to dusk the droning saws
Sang through the fragrant pine
And spilt a perfume on the air
That stirred the heart like wine,
And lightened labor as with song
From some pure lips divine.
The utter peace of shadowy aisles,
Beneath the pine’s dark spires,
Was like some powerful soothing drug
That quieted vain desires,
And cooled the flaming lust of youth
And damped its eager fires.
I dare not ask those hours again
When hope and joy were wed.
I know there can be no return
Where life’s young fancy led ;
For he who dares to wake the past
Must needs awake the dead.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to , The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertiseinents, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for "copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

fused.

The Bulletin will return all unsuitable MS. when
the address is specified and stamps are enclosed. But
no MS. will be returned, or preserved, unless these
conditions arc observed. When MS. is forwarded
without stamps for return it will be understood that
the copy is to be destroyed if not acceptable. Per-
sonal applications for return of MS. cannot receive

THE DRYBERRA CAPITAL. AND THE
JOYS AND HOPES THEREOF.
The short drought broke all of a sudden the
other day, and all manner of outlying places
in N.S.W. were blessed with rain. It fell
at Cudal and Gilgandra and Boomi and
Mungindi, also at Angledool, Boggabilla, Col-
larenebri, Coonabarabran, Dungog, Murwil-
lumbah, Mullumbimby, Pilliga and many
other localities with hard names that are
calculated to blow out the speaker’s front
tooth when pronounced suddenly. But on
that preliminary list which filled the Corn-
stalk soul with gladness the blessed Federal
capital didn’t appear. Its case wasn’t abso-
lutely hopeless, but as usual it lagged behind
when Providence was serving out the drinks.
Recent news was to the effect that
the Molonglo was dry, the Cotter had
ceased to flow, the Queanbeyan had become
a sort of stagnant morass, and the Murrum-
bidgee was feeling debilitated. The Quean-
beyan and the Murrumbidgee matter little,
for they are low-lying streams from which
water could be brought to the Federal city
only by a most expensive pumping process.
But the perishing, after a very brief rain-
shortage, of the Molonglo and the Cotter —
the alleged sources of the capital’s beauty
and glory, and the thing it was to mix with
its whisky and the wherewithal to boil its
tea —was ominous. So were the recent strikes
and clamors of the workmen engaged on the
Federal canital site, their troubles being
mostly based on the undrinkable character
of their surroundings.
The prospects of the rotten capital can be
gauged fairly well by official records. North-
west of it is the meteorological station at
Yass; and east or south-east, but much
nearer, is the one at Queanbeyan.
These, especially Queanbeyan, are the
two most adjacent recording stations,
and on their figures an estimate can
be formed of the amount of rain
which falls directly on the all-Australian
city of Canberra. A little way south is the
recording station at Cooma, and as the
streams of the district mostly come down
from that direction, the Cooma figures are
also an indication. There are 27 meteor-
ological stations on the N.S.W. tableland,
and the latest Official Year Book of
N.S.W. (Part I. of 1913, page 40) giv.es
these figures as the annual average —not a
mere one-year record, but the average:—
Rain Per Annum.
KIANDRA (the reservoir of the abandoned Federal
Capital at Dalgety), 6456 points.
Katoomba, 5606 points; Kurrajong, 4973 ; Spring-
wood, 4059 ; Moss Vale, 3824 ; Mount Victoria,
3685; Tenterfield, 3311 ; Crookwell. 3190 ; Mnr-
rurundi, 3179; Glen Innes, 3173; Armidale,
3133 ; Waleha, 3073 ; Inverell, 3057 ; Bundarra,
3007 ; Pieton, 2977 ; Careoar, 2931 ; Mudgee,
2570; Goulburn, 2526 ; Covvra, 2408.
YASS (station adjacent to the Federal Capital on
the north-west), 2382.
Cassius, 2378 ; Scone, 2374 ; Muswellbrook, 2369 ;
Bathurst, 2369; Bombala, 2256.
QUEANBEYAN (about 10 miles east from the
Federal Capital and the nearest recording station),
2239.
COOMA (the rainfall of which region feeds the
Federal Capital’s rivers), 1898.
In this country the water supply of cities
—to say nothing of the water supply of
other places —is a matter of great import-
ance. Yet the Australian capital was delib-
erately shifted from the best-watered region
in New South Wales, and put on the driest
part of the tableland. A triangle was drawn
having at one extremity the most arid station
in all the vast elevated region which extends
from north to south of tile State ; at another
angle was the second most arid station ; at
the remaining angle—well, the third driest
place couldn’t be roped in, for it didn’t
happen to be near enough, but the best
substitute in the way of drought formed the
last point of the three-sided figure. Taking
the whole coastal district, the whole table-
land and the whole of the western slope,
there are two specially and notably dry
towns on the official list—Urana, with 1694
points of rain per annum; and Cooma, with
1898. It was impossible, with any pretence
of decency or plausibility, to drag in Urana
as a source of the Federal city’s water sup-
ply, so Cooma was taken as the next worst,
or the next damnedest. Walgett, away out
on the Western Plains, averages 1870 points
of rain every 12 months. Cooma and Quean-
beyan are the only places within 200 miles
of the coast, as the crow flies in its sober
moments, which are almost as bad as Walgett.
The selection of the Canberra site was made,
bv the centralisation mob of Sydney, a kind
of gospel, a species of religion, and a new
varietv of crusade. The place became a
Holy Sepulchre which was right as regards
the sepulchre, but wrong as regards the
holiness. To be an anti-’Berra-ite was akin
to being a pro-Boer or an atheist or a bigam-
ist or a worshipper of devils. All this
despite the fact that the place has no great
coal or timber supply, no water-power for
cheap manufacturing purposes, and so little
drinkable fluid that even in the early stages
of the city’s construction the local labor
troubles turn largely on the water question.
On the other hand, the Dalgety site,
originally chosen and afterwards disqualified
by the efforts of the Geebung party of Syd-
ney, has certain claims that oan’t be over-
looked. It is within the borders of New
South Wales as specified by the Federal com-
pact. It is much closer to Sydney than to
Melbourne, and is even closer to Sydney
than to any possible deep-water port in Vic-
toria ; also, as a matter of course, it is much
closer to Sydney than to any port or possible
port in Queensland, S.A., YVestralia or Tas-
mania. It possesses a magnificent water
supply, and the best water power for cheap
manufacturing purposes to be found on the
mainland outside the tropics. That water
was going to waste when the site was
selected, and is still going to waste, and
seems likelv, if the present One-Big-City
crowd of N.S.W. has its way, to go to waste
till Judgment Day. Dalgety, as an Aus-
tralian capital, involved the surrender bv
the Ma State of an almost empty region, and
one which its congestion and concentration
policy is making still more empty. It is far
enough away from Sydney to make it im-
possible that a big Federal city on the Snowy
River and a prosperous Federal port at Two-
fold Bay would seriously compete with the
Ma metropolis. Yet the frenzy of the old
Congestion crowd of Sydney, when the site
beside the Snowy River was appointed as
the Federal centre, was like a bush-fire or a
Mexican insurrection or an unrising of canni-
bals. The breaking out of a Zoo would
have been mild by comparison. The thing
suggested a conflagration in Sheol, and a
panic, and the fire engine disabled, and a
door that opened inwards, and the largest
devil on top, and the smallest devil under-
neath.
* % * -f
The other States, after they had agreed to
let the Ma Community disqualify them as
possible competitors for the capital site- took
little interest in the matter, and New South
Wales has been so accustomed to be con-
trolled. entirely from Sydney that the roar of
that city’s Tory papers and Tory politicians
drowned all other noises. The most untidy
roar of all was that of then-Premier Joseph
Carruthers. Ilis first plea was that, owing
to the immense population and vast richness
and unbounded progress of the Snowy
River district, the State couldn’t dream of
parting with it. ,T. C. Watson —this was
before Watson turned his political coat and
became, like the rest of the Sydney politi-
cians, an advocate of the Dry Capital
made a jest of Carrutiiers’s ignorance by
quoting a few figures from the census. There-
upon the Geebung party strenuously alleged
that the Monaro country was too poor and
barren for the magnificent destiny' of con-
taining the one continental capital on earth,
and the one continental capital in all his-
tory. The party craved to give a richer and
more glorious present to the Commonwealth.
And it never rested in its frenzy of lying
and generosity until Australia got the site
which lies in the triangle formed by Cooma
(less than 19in. of rain per annum), Quean-
beyan (about 22in. of rain per annum) and
Yass (under 24in. of yearly rainfall).
* * * *
In the earliest days of Federation the Old
Parochialists and anti-Federalists and anti-
Australians of Sydney were very mad over
their defeat. The community has a short
memory, and has almost forgotten how the
Purely Local crowd of Pitt and George
streets raved a dozen years or so ago. There
was abundant talk about an appeal to the
British sovereign to squash the Federation.
Some people suggested the raising of an
army to invade Victoria. Victoria, as the
place which for 40 years, had a bigger
population than N.S.W., was a sort of
King Charles’s Head with the For-
eign-traders and anti-Federalists, and once
a single issue of a Sydney anti-Federal
daily contained over 40 separate and indivi-
dual denunciations of the adjacent State,
though it wasn’t claimed that it had origin-
ated the Federal movement or shown any
special energy in the matter. In those days
of drink and blither the statement that a
New South Wales politician was under “Vic-
torian infiuenqes” was about equal to say-
ing he had leprosy, and \ a Sydney madman
proposed to disfranchise the border counties
of N.S.W. because they had acquired
“Victorian ideas.” One Sydney paper
afforded space to an apparently respectable
barrister, said to be in his right mind and
not running about the streets in a nude con-
dition, who offered tp lead an attack on the
local G.P.0., rescue the mails from the
oppression of Federal control, scatter the
Federal officials, and put the Ma State once
more in undivided possession of its post-office
order, its postal note and its penny stamp.
After that the band would presumably play
and an ox be roasted whole. A New South
Wales State Premier demanded that the
first Governor-General should not set foot
on land at Fremantle, Adelaide, Melbourne
or any other polluted place of the sort, but
should save himself up till he reached the
sacred soil of Sydney; so that he should
make his first entrv at a clean, respectable
sort of locality. In the tail-end of this beer
and madness, the Canberra capital was born.
*■){•**
It was intended from the first that it
should be a poor, mean place, for the theory
prevailed, amid the mmg that was running
things by sheer clamor, that no place could
be too mean for a Federal canital. By the
restriction of the Federal port to an isolated
scrap of land at Jervis Bay, with Federal
rights ending at high-water mark, so that
no ships could reach it, the Parochialists
safeguarded themselves as far as might be
asrainst the possibility of any port arising on
the New South Wales coast to be a possible
rival of Sydney. This was an important
matter with the City Parochialists, who hate
all of New South Wales which isn’t Sydney
almost as much as they used to hate Vic-
toria. Anybody who looks on the ruins of
Bo.vdtown, on Twofold Bay, the rival port
that was disqualified by Sydney influences
in the early days, or who considers the costly
deviation which the new North Coast rail-
way makes to avoid opening un Port Ste-
phens, can understand the depth and vast-
ness of this prejudice. Yet Canberra, even
in its capacity as the hopelessly mean capi-
tal of a continent—“a large country town,”
as the Sydney Telegraph described it —
must have a little trade, so it was set down
to its credit that, by reason of its position,
Sydney would probably be able to annex
that trifle. The place was to be a mere
suburb of Sydney. Because of its deficiencies
it couldn’t really set up for itself as Dal-
gety and Twofold Bay might have done,
thereby offering a dreadfuPexample of decen-
tralisation. It might be another Bathurst,
but not another Berlin or New YoTk.
*** * .
In this way the Dry Capital arose—or
rather it didn’t arise. Even the Svdnev
Telegraph smites its political idol, Prime
Minister Cook, with a feather now and then
for his lack of enthusiasm. But it doesn’t
smite hard, for it has lost the energy of the
davs when it was the namnered orvan of
frantic Geebungs who wanted to obliterate
the Commonwealth by force of arms. And
Cook, who has probably seen a great deal
too much of Canberra by this time, develops
no strong enthusiasm. The Dry City plods
along, and very slow and large-footed and
bob-nailed, and lacking in vim is the plod
thereof. Yet it has intervals. When life
becomes too dull, the place has a fuss among
the workmen, who complain that there isn’t
enough water, and that such water as there
is has a bad effect on the stomach by reason
of green scum or dead rabbits, or something.
RE DACEYVILLE.
The Bulletin has received this very
lengthy letter: —
Dear Bulletin,--! don’t see how T can get anv
fair chance of explaining the Dacevville proposition
if you cut mv statements to pieces and publish them
in scraps. You return to the charge against the
Housing Board this week on the same mutilated and
incomplete statement of mine reviewed last week.
Mav I remind you of a few things:—
(1) The administration of Daeeyville is conducted
by a non-political Board, under statute.
(2) Tf there’s a derogation of the statute law by the
Board, we are responsible and not anv Govern-
ment ; nor can criticism of the General financial
policy of the Government affect in any way the
Dacevville scheme, so long as the administrative
Board is honest and competent.
(3) There are surely some things which ought to be
above party strife, and an experiment intended
to cure a real evil and set a well-needed example
to Private Enterprise should be treated fairly.
If as is the fact, you are making charges of malad-
ministration against the Board vou should allow the
case of the Board to he put without mutilation If
you do not, we must wait till the next report of the
Auditor-General will vindicate us —as it will, or
until you initiate proceedings against us in the courts
for maladministration of public offices and funds.
Meanwhile, I cannot see why The Bulletin, which
deprecates partyism and hits fairly all round, should
endeavor to misrepresent an experiment of great poli-
tical value merely because it was initiated by a
Government which it now opposes.
* * *
In ‘‘H. ; Horsecollar’s” letter there are only two
matters which I can reply to now, as, if 1 state
the case fully, it will probably be cut down. These
are: —
(1) That the sinking fund period (50 years) is
unduly long. On that head your correspondent says,
in effect, that as a number of houses in Sydney and
elsewhere, which have been built more than 50 years
ago, are decayed and ramshackle, therefore the
Daceyville houses will not last out the sinking-fund
period. May I point out in regard to this: —
(а) It is an historically incorrect assumption. Some
of the most faithfully-built surviving houses in
Europe were built centuries ago, and in Sydney
some still survive which were built considerably
over 50 years ago, and are good structurally
to-day, though, of course, they are not built
according to our contemporary knowledge of con-
struction, material, sanitation, hygiene, lighting,
room space, ventilation and convenience.
(б) A well-built house of the Daceyville type, with
proper care, ought to last a century. With the
knowledge referred to above and good material
and workmanship, ours ought to last that long
The workmanship and material have both been
praised by experts.
(c) In the decision of the sinking-fund period, the
Board acted upon the best expert advice avail-
able, just as a company would ; and I challenge
any well-known and responsible authority to
gainsay either the competency of the experts
appealed to, or the judgment of their decision.
(2) This statement below I strongly object to.
It is this: —
“Mr. Fitzgerald himself admits that (whether
for purposes of political advertisement, which means
the purchase of votes, or for some other reason) the
rents were originally fixed too low to make the pro-
position solvent even on paper, but the people in
charge apparently haven’t the courage to raise the
rents upon the present tenan. . ’
1 gave the reason of the re-appraisement of the renls
of the first 20 cottages built in these words, which
you extracted from my complete defence:—
“The Board had to fix the rents before the returns
of costs were available for the first houses 1 uilt.”
This might occur to any private owner; but in Ins
case he would have left a margin on his side. The
policy of the Act is not to make a profit out of the
experiment—though if put upon the basis of a private
speculation it could easily pay the ordinary return
required by the investor. Our difficulty—and, of
course, difficulties always arise at the threshold of
such matters, or we would be unusually lucky—was
that we could not obtain from our contractors an
exact statement of the cost of the buildings when the
first were ready for occupation. We did not care to
lose way by waiting, and keeping the houses empty;
there was a dearth of houses, and we had to fix' an
approximate rent on the estimate before us. We
revised this when the true returns came in ; but
without prejudice to the tenants who had taken
possession (20). I think that a fair proposition.
* * * *
I could, if I had space allowed me, show how
in the working out of the village there will be many
sources where the working of a commercial profit
will be perfectly legitimate and business-like. Bfut if
my defence is to be mutilated, it is better to trust
to time to vindicate the character of the management.
May I say three things in conclusion: —
(1) I repudiate the charge—implied as stated—of
maladministration, which you have brought against
the Board, on behalf of my colleagues and myself.
(2) I repudiate the imputation that (lie Board,
which includes the permanent Under-Secretary of
Finance, Mr. J. W. Holliman (who cannot purely be
called a political partisan) ; and Mr. T. 11. Nesbitt
(whose official position ought to be a guarantee r.f
non-partisanship), that we fixed the lower rents for
the first houses —as you say—“for purposes of politi-
cal advertisement, which means the purchase of
votes.” I doubt if a shilling a week on or off the
rent could buy a man’s vote, either in Daceyville or
in Tiie Bulletin office. But that is an imputation
upon the members of the Board which I think is
unwarranted.
(3) I can, finally, give you the assurance that 1
hold the position of chairman of the Housing Board
by statute, and have never been influenced (:•
approached for the purpose of influence by the Govern
ment or any member of it; and, further, that if
such influence were attempted to the detriment of a
scheme built upon lines of policy which I and The
Bulletin have been preaching for the last 24 years,
I would at' once dissociate myself from the manage-
ment. The Bulletin ought to be the last in the
world to rejoice over the failure of Daceyville—if it
were a failure—and the first to rejoice over the
success of an experiment brought into being by a
sentiment which The Bulletin had more to do with
creating in the minds of the Australian democracy
than any other journalistic factor. —Yours, etc.,
John D. Fitzgerald,
Chairman Housing Board.
These propositions in reply:—
(1) This paper alluded in about four lines to a
Minister’s statement that Daceyville wasn’t paying.
It didn’t mention Mr. Fitzgerald at all. That
gentleman sent more than a column of large re-
sponse. Like a natural house-agent or chronic town-
planner, he wallowed in descriptions of the premises
at Daceyville—the back yards and the front yards,
the heating arrangements, the ideal life, the local
festivals, and other irrelevancies. The Bulletin,
not being a cheap advt. for any house-agent, nor a
tramp steamer of 4000 tons, nor a grain elevator,
left out the superfluous exuberances, but it published
word for word, what was relevant—Mr. Fitzgerald’s
remarks on the financial aspect of Daceyville. The
summing-up was that a Minister had declared Dacey-
ville to be run at a loss; the Auditor-General con-
firmed the statement; and Mr. Fitzgerald admitted
it. With all his desire to make a . cui.J case, he
acknowledged that rents were, in some cases, too
He doesn’t deny it now, though he explains a
great deal. This paper, being apparently regarded
as a simple-minded advertising medium, receives about
80 columns a week of this sort of protest. And when
, it doesn’t publish' the stuff in full somebody generally
complains that he has been “suppressed” or “muti-
lated.”
(2) It is, to put the matter shortly, a sample of
gross effrontery to say that The Bulletin misrepre-
sents Daceyville because it dislikes the Holman
Government. The Bulletin stated its objections
clearly enough—-one being that the profits of an
enterprise which belongs to the people at large, and
is created by the money of the people at large,
ought to go to the people and not to a small handful
of favored tenants.
(3) The Bulletin didn’t say that any man's
vote coitldf he bought for Is. per week. Mr. Fitz-
gerald himself puts down the advantage given to the
Daceyville tenant, as compared with the ordinary
tenant, as something much more like 10s. per week.
(4) The statement that the sinking fund, based
on the assumption that the houses would last 50
years, was probably inadequate, was a result of the
Auditor-General’s report. And it seems reasonable
enough. Of course, a Daceyville house may be built
to last 100 years. Many houses are. But evep the
devices of the most enthusiastic town-planner grow
antiquated very fast. Good houses don’t wear out:
they become obsolete, and have to be reconstructed
at great expense or destroyed. It is quite possible
that, 50 years’ hence, Mr. Fitzgerald’s methods may
look like those of a cave-dweller, and people may
wonder if his architect lived up a tree. It isn’t
good to give way to that intense conservatism which
assumes that the ideas of the present time are perfect
and final, and to estimate the sinking fund accord-
ingly.
(5) Finally, Mr. Fitzgerald is requested not to
wail too much about not being allowed space in
which to spread himself. Everything in his first
letter that had the slightest bearing on this naper s
remarks were published. When he pours himself
out by yards, and does it in about the worst fist to
be found between here and Timbuctoo) he hasn t
to find the space. That job is left for the paper that
prints him. It isn’t a friendly dodge to make thp
renlv so long that it must be cut as a matter of
space, and then use that abbreviation as a grievance.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Bruce Smith's Body.
A defunct Briton, who being oead yet
speaketh, has been holding forth for some
weeks past re the value of British protec-
tion. His name was Benton oefore it be-
came simply Body, and he was a landowner
in Mexico. One day he went to see a general
variously described as a “rebel,” a “consti-
tutionalist,” a plain brigand and a soldier
of fortune; there are about 600 generals
loose lor tight) in Mexico just now, and they
are hard to size up. He went to complain
about alleged damage done to his property,
and he never came back. Inquiry broke out,
and it transpired that he was dead. All the
subsequent news comes from the Mexican
general—one Villa. The other man being
dead Villa has the story all to himself. He
lias alleged, variously, that he was abused by
Benton, that he was attacked by Benton,
that Benton had committed four murders,
that the execution was justified by military
law, that he would do the same again in like
circumstances, that he has a good case —and
that he won’t dig up and return the body, for
that would be sacrilege, though later he
offered to send certain diplomatic representa-
tives to the body by special train. Anyhow, it
appears certain that no British consul or other
British representative was present at Ben-
ton’s trial, if he had one; and that he went
to his grave in such a hurry that lie hadn’t
time to lodge an appeal either with the
nearest British authority or with Villa’s
commander-in-chief, or with the more or
less nominal President at the City of
Mexico. It seems to have been his
busy day and he couldn’t wait. Now a
military commander in war-time has large
powers as regards foreigners who butt in,
but even the general-in-chief of the army of
a great Power usually conducts the proceed-
ings with some semblance of publicity, and
professes to show that the foreigner did
reall-y butt in. Also, Axilla, who was a bri-
gand of sorts before he obtained a general’s
commission to keep him quiet and became
one of the innumerable scrimmagcrs of
Mexico, hardly ranks with a French or Ger-
man or Russian field-marshal. In the circum-
stances one might expect an intimation from
London that the matter would be coldly and
impartially investigated, and that Villa and
his chief would have every opportunity to
explain, but that if the explanation didn’t
improve on acquaintance Villa would , have
a meat strike all to himself, even if the re-
public had to be turned upside-down in the
process. But things are different nowadays.
The United States won't protect foreigners
in Mexico and Central America, yet under
the Monroe doctrine it prohibits other
countries interfering. There isn’t much of
an army behind the prohibition, but a very
small row with the U.S. would stop a por-
tion of Bull’s foreign food supply, and ff
the U.S. carried the war into Canada it
might stop a large portion of Bull’s food
supply and make the chop and loaf go up
wonderfully. Also, the U.S. tourist would
cease for a while to come to England and
spend money. Then Britain owns a huge
proportion of the great ships that trade to
the United States, and in case of war they
would be shut out, and the Germans and
other folk would annex the trade. Britain
has its ships on every sea to be harried by
fast U.S. cruisers, while there are so few
U.S. merchant ships on the seas that British
cruisers could hardly nay for axle grease
even if they ran down the lot. Furthermore,
J. Bull has become so rich —or rather the
rich Bull has become so rich, for the poor
Bull is very impecunious—that many a
feeble twonennv Sta»te could make a profit
by war with him. It would confiscate local
British capital, and repudiate the debt it
owes to Britain, and would then retire into
its back yard and wait events. Furthermore
Bull has a very small voluntary army, and
he has hundreds of millions of nigger sub-
jects to keep in order. So he has a great
fear about tying up his armv in foreign ven-
tures, unless there are rich goldfields like
those of the Boer country to be exploited,
and all the Jews of Old Jewry are shoving
from/behind and bidding him take risks. So
Benton will nrobably remain very quietly
in his grave. This is bow the course of the
recent cablegrammic information goes:—
Mr. F. D. Acland. Parliamentary Secretary to the
Foreign Office, said that. .. .British intervention
would be futile and impolitic.
Sir Edward Orby said that.... he had communi-
cated with the United States because the latter alone
could exercise influence in Mexico with a view to
getting justice done.
Sir Edward Grey said the Government had ashed
the United States to inform General Villa as to
the feeling created in Great Britain by the execu-
tion of Benton.
This will probably make Axilla feel very
bad.
The British Consul at Galveston had been ordered
to proceed to El Paso.
It is thought likelv that the United States will
now rely on General Carrenza to coerce General
Villa to return Benton’s body.
Benton may not be any special sort of per-
son, but the episode gives rise to thought.
If this country is invaded, and things are
done which are altogether outside the usages
of war, and the French Governor of New
Caledonia, at the instance of the British
authorities, relies on General Hung Won to
coerce General Cow To and make him re-
store Bruce Smith’s body—well, how fax-
advanced will we be? It might be almost
better to rely on our own defences.

A Tale of Rank Foolishness.
Off Dalley-street, which is a yard or _two
from this office, there lies a blind alley 50ft.
or 60ft. long, by about 10ft. or 12ft. wide. 1 - A
member of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals could get enough material
for prosecutions from this lane alone to
satisfy him for weeks; and it is only one of
thousands like it that are scattered through-
out Sydney. Horses are driven into it
daily, attached to drays and tipcarts; and
subsequently backed out with shouts, oaths,
hlows. kicks, mouth-iabbings and other mani-
festations of man’s inhumanity to brute. If
the lane were abolished altogether it would
add to the beautification of the city; and if
it were run right through into Bridge-street
(a feasible step, since the building that
makes it an alley of the blind variety is
coming down t. a lot of needless misery
would be obviated. Owing chiefly to the
idiotic state of the law the chances are that
neither of these things will be done. The
adjacent pronerty-owners are highly un-
likely to undertake the job at their own
expense. Their line of argument would
naturallv be that anything of the sort is
essentially the business of the City Council.
And, of course, by all the laws of common-
sense it is. But by statutory law. which so
often has no relation whatever to sense, the
Council is debarred from touching the lane.
The reason is that it is less than 20ft. wide
Years ago, when the Council had a free hand
in regard, amongst other things, to alleys
or lanes of any length or width, Private
Enterprise took to constructing on its prop
erties narrow ways of such a hopelessly in-
sanitary, and dangerous and generally unde-
sirable character that the Council was
driven, in the public interest, to deal with
them on the spot. The villainous proprietors
of the causeways were then enabled to claim
heavily , for business disturbance, for resump-
tion, and for other profitable shams. The
habit of constructing snail- or goat-tracks for
the purpose practically of blackmail, grew so
common that Parliament waded in to check
the abuse. It acted with extraordinary
futility. Instead of legislating so as to pre-
vent the wrong, it legislated in such a way
as to weaken the hands of those who had
tried, as best they could, to right it. In-
stead of laying it down that no more of these
alleys should under any circumstances be
built, and that the existing ones should be
immediately done away with, it decreed that
the Council should henceforth have no power
to touch any of them, no matter how unde-
sirable. The Council’s activities were
limited to lanes of the width of 20ft,. or
more. That is the whole explanation of the
continued existence of archaic survivals such
as the above-mentioned blind alley-way off
Dalley-street. It is a public eyesore; an
inconvenience to those who have to use it;
and an engine of torture to inoffensive ani-
mals. Yet it can’t be abolished, seemingly,
unless a number of private citizens come
together and decide to do the work out of
their own pockets.
The One Disease That Really Counts.
Ovek three years ago Dr. Bull, of Mel-
bourne University, was instructed to carry
out a series of tests of blood specimens sup-
plied from various sources, to determine the
relative prevalence of syphilis. He reported
to the Board of Health the other day, and
his figures are instructive: —
Sources of Blood No. of Reaction Percentage.
Specimen. Tests. Positive. Negative.
Wards of the State .. 258 31.39 68.61
Hospital and private
patients . . . • 13,594 41.98 58.0-
Lunacy department . . 525 59.39 40.61
Criminal department .. 122 61.4/ 38.53
These tests, comparatively small though they
are in number, make it possible to trace the
course and effects of the disease. Plainly
it is almost wholly inherited, as regards the
first class of victim; partly inherited and
partly acquired as regards the second (in
this class the number of tests is so large as
almost to fix absolutely the respective per-
centages of clean and unclean) ; and finally
one gets the results in lunacy and crime.
What an overwhelming charge on the State
i t represents ! What mad extravagance (to
put it on no higher grounds) to leave such
a curse practically unassailed! Yet the
confirmed syphilitic is not sent to a sana-
torium, or the incipient to a hospital; they
are not quarantined; they are not even
fined “ten bob or the rising” like the com-
mon drunk. But drink doesn’t fill per
cent, of the gaols or 59 per cent, of “insane
hospitals.
The Newest Peace Apostle.
The very latest peace humbug who has
arrived in Australia is a certain Jordan, of
Stanford University, California. Jordan
follows a safe occupation _ as Professor of
Arboreal Geology or something, and has care-
fully selected as his residence a country
which has never seen real trouble within his-
toric times, for even the U.S. Civil War
didn’t get further west than New Mexico,
where Canby, the Federal commander,
scrapped amid much blood and ruins with
the Confederates Sibley and Scurry,
around Albuquerque and Santa F 6. Jor-
dan, lifting his eyes from his books in his
shaded and cobwebbed collegiate retreat,
where his salary is secured by the munifi-
cence of certain dead-and-gone patrons, and
not even the moth and rust interrupt his dig-
nified leisure, gives lofty advice to the people
who are fighting the world’s battle out in the
sun. Here is some of it: —
I know you are very touchy on your White Aus-
tralia policy, and so are the people of California, so
far as the" .Japanese are concerned. The Japanese,
I say emphatically, do not want to emigrate to Cali-
fornia, nor do they want to come out to Australia.
They are not tropical people, and they don t want to
settle in the tropics ahy more than Europeans do.
They have absolutely no thought of aggression, ex-
cept, perhaps, in Manchuria. They wouldn’t utilise
Australia if it were handed over to them. For
the next 50 years they will have their hands full in
putting their own house in order.
I think I know what I am talking about, as
I have been all through Japan, and have inter-
viewed different people from the Emperor down to
the peasant. The working classes are as much against
war as they are in other countries....
All the agitations against Japanese emigration are
to be deprecated, because it provokes feeling in
Japan, and embarrasses the Government. The best
way would be for the Australian people to send a
delegation to Japan, to have a heart-to-heart talk
with the Japanese Government. This would be much
better than all the agitations.
No; in my opinion, there is not the slightest
necessity for Australia to have a navy.
The apostle of No-Defence is a curious crea-
ture. The Japanese, he says, are not tropi-
cal people. AVell, no one said they were.
Nor are the English. But as Melbourne and
Adelaide are much further away from the
tropics than Tokio, Jordan’s statement
doesn’t seem to carry much comfort for Mel-
bourne and Adelaide. Not being tropical
people, it is alleged, the Japs don’t want
either Australia or California. It is hard
to see where the evidence comes in, seeing
that most of Australia is outside the tropics
and California is wholly outside them —in
fact it is in almost exactly the same lati-
tudes as Japan. The working classes in
Japan, so the peace professor avers, “are
as much against war as they are in other
countries.” If that is all he can say, it is
a very poor reason why this country should
disarm and trust to Providence. For if the
Jap is only just as unwarlike as the Bul-
garian, Serb, Turk, Macedonian and Mexi-
can, to say nothing of the Haytian,
and the Arab and Moor and a lot
more, then he is fully as placid as
a bag of hornets, and distinctly less hostile
than the Devil. The man who tells Aus-
tralia it can do without defences because its
prospective enemy is as bad as anybody else,
looks like an outrageous joke. The assur-
ance that the Japanese don’t want to push
their way abroad is rather quaint as coming
from a man whose Government has just been
bullied by the Japanese into lettingtheir
people come' abroad —into U.S. territory.
And it seems rather a muddled thing on the
part of a mild, unwarlike professor to wail
about the white man’s “agitation against
Japanese emigration,” when the Japanese has
shoved the white man out of his own: Jap
country so strenuously that at last census
there were less than 7000 whites left in all
Nippon, while the Jap abroad in white men’s
lands amounted to between 200,000 and
300.000. The apostle of peace is really a
misfortune. He can’t preach his gospel to
the colored alien, for the colored alien would
hit him in the eye with a clod as soon as he
became serious. Being an inveterate coward
and a hater of clods, he avoids the colored
alien. But he holds forth to the patient and
forbearing white man, and urges him to let
the colored or partially-colored person tread
on him with impunity, and assures him that,
if he is good and kind and just and mild and
unarmed, the colored or partially-colored per-
son won’t dream of doing him any harm, he
(the colored or partially-colored person)
being the same as God, and incapable of
wrong. It seems a pity that Jordan should
waste his eloquence on such a well-ordered
community as this. He should go across to
Mexico, right at his own door, where a
peace apostle is badly wanted, and tell his
tale to General Villa —the man who lately
killed Benton and others.
Dry Rot.
The ■ Weary-AVatt Government of ATctoria
has annarently given up the idea of doing
certain vitally necessary things as being too
hopelessly laborious. At the customary rate
of nrogress the long-demanded Greater Mel-
bourne Council Bill will take six months to
pass; an effective Charities Bill cannot be
run through in a day. or a week; anew and
sane Public Health Bill is an urgent neces-
sity, and a dozen other measures crv aloud
for consideration and enactment. And mean-
while the session is closed. From an admin-
istrative point of view the Murray crowd
is even more futile than it is from a legisla-
tive one. Ministerial control of the Railway
Department is a subtle joke; in Education
matters the Minister is a mere figure-head ;
vhe Mines Minister takes so little interest ir,
the duties of his office that he has not vet
troubled to take action on the scarifying
report of the Dredging Commission, handed
in over a month ago; the Closer Settlement
“head” has allowed things to get into such
a state of muddle and loss as would ensure,
his immediate “sack” were he in the employ
of Private Enterprise ; the Vic. immigration
policy, such es it was. together with its
co-ordinating labor bureau, has practically
come to a dead end ; the Public Health De-
partment is above ground, but it might as
well be under: and the Chief Secretary’s De-
partment —well. Weary is chief, and that
says enough. The chaotic state of affairs
regarding I’ublic Health is typical. Ihe
other day a Warragul shire councillor made
some startling allegations about the dairies
in his district —about the maggotty cream
that was sent to city factories and there
manufactured into prime factory butter,
about rats, sucking pigs and other abomina-
tions that fell into cans of milk that was
afterwards consumed by Melbourne babies
and adults, and so on. Questioned whether
he proposed to do anything in this matter,
Health Minister J. Dry Brown said he
didn’t think so. He wasn’t sure whether the
case wasn’t rather one for the Agricultural
Department; the various and amended Health
•Acts were so complicated that no one seemed
to know what powers the Board had, or
whether it had any at all; in fact, there
was not in existence one solitary copy of the
Act which had been altered so as to bring it
up to date in accordance with successive
amendments. But Brown proffered a gleam
of hope —“anew Health Act was wanted,
and he was busy making investigations with
a view of framing one.” Not framing one,
be it observed, but only making investiga-
tions.
A Chance of Wealth.
Last week, the Editor of this paper leceived.
at his private house, an unsolicited batch of
tickets in the “John Bull” Derby Sweep,
1914. The gamble has been organised,
apparently, by the trouble-scarred editor of
John Bull, of London, and it is being run
bv a firm named Smallman and Terry, of
Geneva, Switzerland. Switzerland is the
country that the commission agents and bet-
ting touts of old England have invaded since
they were warned off Dutch and Belgian soil;
so one may assume that the “managers” of
the Derby Sweep are, in their working hours,
bookmakers. They profess to hold £50,009
wherewith to pay a fortune to the ticket-
holder who draws the winner of this year’s
Derby ; and various smaller fortunes to those
whose luck is less astounding. The John
Bull Football Cup Sweep, which was brought
off under the same auspices last year, ap-
pears to have been the inspiration of the
Derby venture. The reflection is not an
encouraging one to possible investors.
The Football Sweep occasioned pro-
found dissatisfaction amongst Cold Land
punters, also widespread suspicion and
blasphemy. The idea was prevalent in
British gambling circles, and in the bosoms
of countless artless British “mugs” that
things had been far other than they seemed.
For the benefit of Australians who may be
disposed to risk their hard-won or -earned or
-borrowed or -stolen —as the case may be —
savings, in a sovereign’s worth of John Bull
sweep tickets, it may be mentioned (1) that
Mr. Bottomley, who is the originator of the
venture, while a man of conspicuous ability
as company promoter, as conductor of his
own defence in the various legal cases with
which he has been associated, and as a
Bankruptcy Law expert, is not the sort of
citizen to whom one would hastily en-
trust one’s entire fortune; that (2) Messrs.
Smallman and Terry are oply in Geneva,
because Ostend, Flushing and other towns,
not to mention London, refuse to stand
them, in a business sense ; and (3) that Aus-
tralia is over 12,000 miles from the scene of
the sweep-drawing. Other reasons might be
adduced why the John Bull Derby Sweep,
1914, is a sound investment to leave alone;
but the above should suffice. In the mean-
while! the attention of the Postal Authorities
is hereby called to this concern. The
sooner they refuse to touch Smallman and
Terry’s correspondence, the sooner the cash
of a number of Australian simpletons will
cease, to stream out of this country, never,
in all likelihood, to return.

“H.S.” : The S. M. Herald printed the fol-
lowing, in its leading columns, on last Mon-
day :
It may be remembered that even Sydney, in spite
of the' N. S. Wales sheen and cattle runs, was the
scene of a serious meat famine at least once within
recent, years, when its meat supply was still the
private business of certain public companies. The
meat service had to be restricted in some parts to a
few hours of the day. In the mild panic which fol-
lowed,' the State made short work of the meat com-
panies’; and the greatest city in Australia is now
considered reasonably safe from any possible failure.
On looking more closelv into the matter I
find that what the Herald actually printed
was this
It may be remembered that even London, in spite
of the English climate, was the scene of a serious
water famine at least once within recent years, when
its water supply was still the private business of
certain public companies. The water service had to
be restricted in some parts to a few hours of the
day. In the mild panic which followed the State
made short work of the water companies; and the
greatest city in the world is now considered reason-
ably safe from any possible failure.
A trifling difference in terms, I grant you,
but the good old Socialistic principle is the
same. State water, State railways, State
gas, State meat—who shall say that one is
more or less desirable than the other? The
sole difference between the Herald and an
avowed Socialist is that the Socialist ap-
proves of Socialism, whereas the Herald
only grows lvric on the subject of all those
forms of Socialism that have already been
introduced.
“Molar” : The N.S.W. Full Court has given
a sensible decision in a case which has been
worrying the tooth-pulling industry for
months past. Before 1912 certain dentists,
registered or licensed under the law, were
entitled to use the letters L.D.S. (Licensed
Dental Surgeon). In 1912 the Dental Board
passed a regulation refusing this right, and,
when some of the well-known members of
the profession in Sydney declined to obey the
order, proceeded to roll up its sleeves
and sharpen its tusks. Finding that it
could only deal effectively with dentists who
were guilty of “infamous conduct” the
Board boldly announced that the conduct of
the men who flouted the restrictive regula-
tion and continued to use the forbidden let-
ters was “infamous,” and refused to allow
them to practise. Against this one of them
appealed, and a flo»d of argument was
poured before the Full Court as to the
meaning of the word “infamous.” Of course,
it fell -to the lot of the luckless Ma State to
conduct (and pay for) the Board’s marvel-
lous contention that a licensed dental sur-
geon had no right to mention the qualifica-
tion after it (the Board—which had noth-
ing to do with the matter in the first place)
had told him not to do so. The Full Court
didn’t say “tripe,” as our Prime Minister
puts it, but it said something equivalent
with a dash of Costs.
The Capable Lieutenants.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Mr. Wade has come to the conclusion that in view
of the present state of political parties in the House,
he is justified in devoting more time to the practice
of his profession. . . .The Government has an effective
majority, and nothing that the Opposition can say
or do is likely to reduce it Mr. Wade's figure
has dominated the Liberal party of late years. He
has been so unequivocally the leader and the only
possible leader that it is not easy to discover who
is going to take his place during his absences in the
next Parliament. . . .The Liberal party does not take
sufficient trouble to encourage new blood.
—S. M. Herald.
When the tired Lender thought he’d retire
—he was always alone in the fight—
The “Liberal” press with a good deal of ire
admitted that he was right.
But kept to itself the reasons which urged
the Leader to flee,
Because, as a matter of fact, they verged on
political lunacee/
Firstly, it said, there was nothing on earth
to pass out the Borrowing Crew —
They couldn’t reduce the majority’s girth,
or hinder its lOXJ !
Which they cheerfully hoped might grow
still more, because, if it didn’t, we’d be
In a terrible hole, or upon a lee shore, for
casual £ s. d. !
Still, at the same time, they were afraid if
Labor by chance did last,
There wasn’t a soul but Gregory Wade who
Labor from power could cast!
Because there was no one to step in his
shoes, or wall: in his trousers and
socks * i
So Labor still scatters its lOUs, and the
Liberal ship’s on the rocks.
Yet, nevertheless, and please do not forget,
there are others —the papers say
Who may know enough: to come in from the
wet at a possible future day;
Though only the ’Erald and Telegraph
know the heroes who are to replace
Our Gregory Wade in the frontest row —
and save Ma from disgrace!
Again, as the ’Erald wisely remarks, when
Wade is gone there will be
A H of a row where the Parkiiill parks
in the Cellar where few can see,
Because it will have to “encourage new
blood” and purchase a new rig-out,
Or else it’s name will lie just plain Mud,
and its principles up the Spout! t
But, meantime, Holman and all his gang
of Borrowing Fiends will rest
In peace, and hurl their loans with a bang
at old Bull-Coiien’s chest;
For Wade is tired and wants to retire —as
the ’Erald is glad to see —
Though who the dickens will now aspire
to Wade’s job puzzles me!
It’s all very rotten, and more than sad to
see the Party we knew
In days of old, that was not so mad with
the loan and the lOU
As Labor has grown in its lust for power,
and jobs, and billets and perks—_
To see that party crawl and cower while its
Leader tires and shirks!

Fob a long, cheerless; beefless week Premier
Holman wandered in and out and round
about Sydney imploring the butcher commu-
nity to lend him its ear. And for a whole
week be met nothing but disappointment.
The strike was wholly illegal, and a breach
of the award of the Labor Government’s
own Arbitration Court, and a reflection on
the Labor Government, and a clod hurled at
the union officials. Also it became a rather
purposeless piece of bravado when the
strikers were offered an early hearing of
their demand for anew award, provided
they would ?"-> through the form of obeying
the law and observing the old award in the
interim, and thereby cease to lose their
wages. Unfortunately, breakage of the law.
especially when the Labor Government has
made it. is now something like a point of
honor with a certain section of unionists.
And the Tlolman Government, presumably
for fear of losing votes, would as soon com-
mit suicide as enforce the law. It has the
mistaken idea that weakness and wobble
are the qualities that lead to long continu-
ance in office. One of these days Holman
will be run over by a tramcar while return-
• ing, covered with onnrdbrium, from a meet-
ing at which he has vainly implored the
Preachers’ Union or the Associated Dossers
to make some pretence of consideration for
the statutes.
In its present form the Advertising Associa-
tion of Victoria looks a very hopeless propo-
sition. It is divided against itself. The
intention of the promoters was to organise a
close ass. of advertising agents, canvassers,
advt. writers and kindred commercial jour-
nalists, together with advertisers who are
looking for new ideas. Confined to persons
concerned only in the business methods of
advertising, the A.A. would prosper. But
some of its first members are members also
of the Typothetse, which is right up against
the interests of all the other fellows. One
of these told a plain, unvarnished tale of
Typothetse extortions to the Inter-State
Commission last week. When he called for
tenders for printing a catalogue (18 months
a?o). seven Melbourne printers conspired to
ask £715 for the job. Another local printer
put in a £550 tender, but afterwards with-
drew it, under fear of “Typo” punishment.
Three Ballarat firms were afraid to open
their mouths. The job of printing this advt.
matter was eventually placed with a Sydney
firm for £485—£230 less than the Melboui’ne
Combine price. More evidence to the same
effect went to show the absurdity of an asso-
ciation wherein the advertising lambs are
expected to fraternise with the printing and
paper-selling wolves.
“Binnacle” : Once more disaster lias over-
taken the imported dredge. This time it is
the Dutch dredge Posidonia, imported to
work the seaweed deposits in Spencer’s Gulf,
S.A.“ It was purchased in liotterdam \.o the
order of the Anglo-Foreign Fibre Cos. It
arrived damaged at Carnarvon (W.AA, and
after being, fixed up. got as far as Fre-
mantle, which port it left on January 28.
Being over a month out and practically un-
insurable, the dredge, with 22 lives on board,
is regarded as lost. Last year, when the
Manchester disappeared between Maoriland
and N.S.W., it was stated that henceforth
dredges would not be allowed to make voy-
ages in Australian waters without convoy.
Primarily built for harbor work, this type
of craft is quite incapable of surviving heavy
weather such as is experienced in the Bight.
Still, the Posidonia was insured, and that is
a comfort. So is the fact that there are
plenty more where it came from. Every
Tory and Foreign-trader knows they can’t
be made in Australia.
An old Victorian sergeant of police
arrested attention last week in a suburban
court whilst making the usual farewell re-
marks. He stated that the old-timers in
the force reckoned they had not had a
square deal, inasmuch that the Government
(which is a changeful and forgetful animal),
after giving them to understand that they
would be turned out permanently to grass
on reaching the age of 55, had compelled
them to linger «n like toothless lions until
they were GO, thus wringing an extra five
yehrs.’ service out of them just when they
were ready to take off their helmets and
throw them into the dustbox. As well as
being a bad breach of faith, it is a poor,
shabby device to keep the so-called “force”
strong on naper when actually it is no more
than a walking partv of aged men who are
no longer fleet of foot or strong of arm.
A 60-year-old cop can’t be expected to out-
run a speedy criminal or wrestle with a
strong one, and the chances are that he is
too weary of his job to be even intelligent.
“Converted Lag” : The no-licence but not
no-drink town of Invercargill (M.L.) pos-
sesses a gaol. Inside the gaol is a church.
On the roof of the church is a sort of gang-
way, where an armed warder does sentry-go
during service. Indoors the parson says,
“Flee from the wrath to come.” and outside
the .warder shoots the person who takes the
advice too seriously.

Another revue has come to Sydney town,
although William Anderson, who imported
it from America, has branded it a "panto-
mime extravaganza,” whatever that may be.
It lias all the requisite features of a
revue, as Australia understands it. It
is about less than nothing in particular,
lias a hotchpotch of ragtime and music, the
"book” was apparently raked together in
oOse.c. from the back files of the more or less
comic magazines, and there is a plank run-
ning down the centre of the stalls, so that
the most effective display of the female por-
tion of ' the co.’s—er—limbs may be made.
After that the. doubt as to whether “The
Land of Nod” is a revue is cleared up and
totally evaporated. The first act finds Alice
(Bonny) in Wonderland (Land of Nod)
where she meets the Jack of Hearts, the
King and Queen, the Man in the Moon, the
Welsh Rarebit, the Chorus Girl, the Weather
Man, the April Fool and various other notor-
ious characters. The setting is the House of
Cards, with the Peppermint River in the dis-
tance, and for this, as well as for the setting
of 1 the second act (Nightmare Palace), Rege
Robins and liis assistants can peg two. Also,
the dressings of the crowd on the stage are
highly recommended ; and the girls are pretty
and will probably get more dash and abandon
into their work as the season gets going.
They show signs of that in “On the Mississip-
pi,” which, although it is rapidly ageing, gets
the big applause and shout of the show.
Next to it the most pronounced appreciation
goes to the Man in the Moon and Bonnie
after singing the cuddle song. “You Made Me
Love You.” which is about the most lunatic-
asylum brand of rag ditty that The Bulle-
tin has met.
“ NEVER SAY DIE” AT SYDNEY

nevertheless, she is bright and vivacious and
wins her audience at once. Priscilla Verne,
as the Chorus Girl, is the same old popular
Priscilla. She sets the show moving in the
first act with “The Belle of Baldhead Row.”
Maudie Goldspink, as the Telephone Girl, in-
(duces this scribe to be calm for her sake next
time he has to use the d— instrument. Like-
wise his supply cf flattery is available for
Jane Curtis (is “Jane” going to be the
fashion again, or is it a printer’s error for
“Janfe”?) as the Queen of Hearts. Neither
of those girls has a word to speak, but they
don’t need it. Ruth Nevins is a fine, up-
standing Jack of Hearts, who has the “fat”
of the singing, and gets through creditably.
A girl whose name is not on the cast leads
the song and dance, “On the Mississippi.”
Her name should be there permanently. Of
the men, Tom Armstrong is the Man in the
Moon and the best of the bunch, but he
ought to have enough experience by this
time to know that his long, wearisome gag
turn with Priscilla Verne howls for reduc-
tion. The same remark applies to his later
gagging with Harry Quealy (the Welsh
Rarebit), and Arthur Don (the April Fool).
"The Land of Nod” will run at Sydney
Palace for six weeks, bar lire, flood, inva-
sion, battle, murder, tornado, unexpected fall-
ing down of the premises, unexpected fall-
ing down dead of all the principals, riot,
insurrection, plague, repudiation of the
Public Debt, incurable drought, general
strike, Judgment Day, or other unavoidable
happening.

The Australian drama is not yet drama-
tised. The Theatre League of N.S.W.,
formed for the encouragement of Australian
plays, Australian playwrights and Austra-
lian players (P. A. Cameron, hon. sec.,
Town Hall, Sydney), gave its first per-
formance at the .Repertory Theatre last
Wednesday. An ambitious programme of
five ofie-acters was drearily presented by
amateurs. In order to present the plays
anonymously the League mentioned the
several authors only by their initials —and
in three cases there were actors with these
initials in the cast. Thus it wn« easy to
identify F.R.F., the author of “Fore-
stalled,” as F. Robert Forster, who played
the chief part. “Pipette” was announced
as an adaptation. The audience did not see
the necessity. “Things Look Black” was a
conventional comedy built round an old and
trivial idea ; and there wasn’t any building
to speak of. “The Tale of a Comet” was
titled an Australian farce, and dared all the
conventions of the evenin'- by pretending to
take place in Australia. The scene,
in a country newspaper office, had possibili-
ties of good “Abo.” Australian comedy.
Nothing happened except some mild compli-
cations of the sort that occur wherever there
is a music hall. “Forestalled” promised well
when a burglar discovered a placid wife
about to elope with a drear gentleman friend.
But he merely seized the opportunity to
utter moral platitudes, then to recount the
story of his life, and finally to recognise
that the wife was bis long-lost che-ild. The
only play that looked like a play bore obvious
evidence of having been manufactured in
New York, and therefore it needs no criti-
cism here. The stage appointments were ad-
mirable. Miss Millie A. Cole and F. Robert
Forster were bright spots in a sea of un-
intelligent acting. The Theatre League is
ambitious, and performances such as these
are to be encouraged, since without them
authors could not see how bad their plays
are.

If Uncle Tom had not engaged four nig-
gers to supply ragtime songs and a few
miniature performers to singandance rag-
time in between, his show at the Sydney
Adelphi would have fallen almost as flat as
it is possible for a show to fall without dis-
appearing altogether. When things begin
to sag, and they do sag at times, whoever
is handiest invites the niggers, who are
always kept handy, to oblige and then the
house cheers up and is ready to bear with
Uncle Tom for a while longer. But the
Thomas whom authoress Harriet B. Stowe
viewed through the eye of imagination at
long range would scarcely recognise him-
self if he wandered into the Adelphi. Appar-
ently as long as there is a villain to make
things unpleasant for a few burnt-cork
slaves, a quadroon gal, a more or less re-
ligious neighbor, and the pious nigger Uncle
Tom ; and so long as there are the burnt-
cork slaves, the quadroon gal. etc., etc., to
shake at the knees when the villainous slave-
boss comes in sight, and provided there
always remains and continues a well-edu-
cated slave to make heroic speeches and
escape and be persecuted by the slave-boss
aforesaid, it doesn’t much matter whether
the play bears any further resemblance to
the original book. The crowd goes out for
its beer during the intervals quite satisfied.
Cyril Mackav, as George Harris, the edu-
cated slave, has a fairly easy time, with
little more to do than look worried and say
good-bye to Eliza. Miss Gertrude Boswell,
as Eliza, who doesn’t have quite so much
spare time on her hands, is a decided suc-
cess. Vivian Edwards as Simon Degree, is
everything that an Adelphi villain should
be if he wants to keep his job. Also Herbert
Leigh, as Uncle Tom. and Miss Nell Hol-
royd. as the utterly impossible Topsy, get
honorable mention, along with the four nig-
ger ragtimers and the juvenile songan-
dancers.

Where to go in Sydney till it’s time to do
something else: —
Crystal Palack : "The Third Degree,” five reels
of “thrilling situations,” wherein the N. York police
methods are exposed. If it isn’t the “most absorbing
drama ever enacted for photo-play purposes,” the press
agent is what, of course, no press-agent can be.
Empress: “The Wedding Present,” full of “grip-
ping episodes,” which sounds as though it might be
another masked-burglar scare.
Colonial: “The Buried Crime,” concerning a pro-
fessor who invents a terrible explosive, capable even
of shattering little William McMillan’s faith in him-
self.
Lyric : Satan s Castle,” based on the carryings-on
of the barons of the bad old days.
Glaciarium and Olympia: Asta Nielsen, in “Suf-
fragette,” wherein one of the shrieking sisterhood is
deputed to blow up the Prime Minister. Marries him
instead. Said to be much more effective.
Spencer’s Lyceum: Re-opens on Saturday with
“Leah Kleshna,” the converted burglar-lady.
Imperial: “The Forgotten Melody,” a “domestic’
drama with a detachable moral.
Between Tango Teas the Sydney Tivoli
still manages to make a few bob for Hugh
Mclntosh, and if the cash is as good as the
programme lI.D. needn’t grumble about the
quality. The chief names on the pay-list
this week are the Two Bobs, violinist
Tucker, Waterbury Bros, and Teenev and
the Tom Davis Trio of motor-cyclists,' about
whom all the remarks that are called for
have been made already.

Meat-famished Sydney is still thronging
to the Criterion to gloat over actors eating
a real dinner in public. These exhibitions
will be continued until the price of food-
stuffs soars too high. One evening, however
the cast of “Never Say Die” will be one
short. The artist who plays Herman, whose
delightfully naturalistic work this critic in-
advertently overlooked in his notice last
week, will appear as “Roast Beef,” elec-
trically cooked, in the sensational dinner
scene, positively his farewell appearance.
It will be impossible to find an understudy
for Herman, win it may be mentioned, is a
tripe-hound that looks like a centipede with
all but four of his legs missing.
On Saturday that pleasant morality for
everywidower, “His House in Order,” will
have its final presentation by the clever
Little Theatre company, and Sydney will see
it no more. On Monday night “David Gar-
rick” will be revived—which is not to infer
that that David was ever really dead.

At the National (Sydney) this week the
bill has contained much the same performers
as during the previous week, but they are
mostly the kind of performers that are
allowed to stay a long time anywhere they
go. To-night, however, Henri Kubelik will
play his fiddle for the last time before mov-
ing on. Other changes are darkly hinted
at by the publicity department, whose busi-
ness it is to insinuate things as in a glass
darkly so that the news won’t burst on the
public too suddenly.
Sydney’s White City has been feeling the
depressing effects of lying out in the wet
during the nights of last week, but now that
the local pleasure-hunter appears likely to
get about again minus sea boots, and a para-
sol, the big park, with all its side-shows, will
draw him and the girl as heretofore. Cal-
vert, the high wire-walker, is still going
strong, and has to date covered about 1170
miles of his narrow and aerial chalk-line.
Any angel, walking fly-fashion up the wall
of Heaven or walking upside-down, bee-

the fowl to this office.

“Diplomacy,” the Society melodrama now
running at Sydney Royal, will finish up on
Friday. On Saturday night “A Roval
Divorce” goes on, with Julius Knight in his
old part of Napoleon. Some comedy might
be worked into the show by engaging boxer
Tommy Burns (now revisiting Sydney), and
having two Napoleons, each trying to look
more Napoleonic than the other pretender.
“Come Over Here” is still going strong at
Her Majesty’s, Sydney, and last week .Tack
Cannot’s collection of cigars is alleged to
have touched the 10,000 mark. The comedian
has no intention of smoking any of these
offerings. When a sufficient number has
been amassed the idea is to form a company
and have them treated so as to nroduee a
new variety of rabbit poison. Operations
will begin after the Revue has been running
another six months or so.

A
SWIFT &- COMPANY, AUSTRALASIAN AGENTS, O'COMyExi'&T SYDNEY'
seekers, is taking a ldt of the limelight just
now, and Mclntosh is often over in consulta-
tion with manager Crawford. Last Saturday
it got definitely open again—instead of being
open only sometimes—the very popular Gene
Greene giving this “winter” season a good
start. The Tivoli Gardens, at the Oval, now
have an independent Costume Co. playing a
kind of revue. Along at the _ Exhibition
Garden are Branscombe’s Dandies, with a
steady patronage; the March Show is now
driving them away to the Town Hall for a
week. Also in the open (with a duplicated
programme in its Hindley-street house) is
Wondergraph, with a really striking picture,
“In the Midst of the Jungle,” wherein a lost
girl grows up among lions, jackals and other
strange beasts. These are somehow induced
to play villain or hero; and are shot 05 other-
wise dealt with as the story requires.
West’s has a Stolen Child drama, French,
and finely acted. The Star pictures, run-
ning quietly in the old Tivoli house, have
suddenly come to the front with a Bathing
Beauties’ competition, the girls appearing
personally instead of ner film. The show,
perfectly discreet, proves a distinct draw.
The King’s, where Lennon has replaced
Muller as manager, has a strong programme
—all new Brennan-Fuller turns, except for
the reappearance of Mantell’s quaint mario-
nettes.
From an Adelaide critic: —
Clewin Harcourt’s one-man show at the Society of
Arts contains a few of the striking figure-studies with
which the Australian ex-miner made a name in
Enrope. His charming picture of a small girl was
privately bought to remain in Adelaide after the last
Federal exhibition, and the same model is noticeable
in several of his best things this time. Also, he draws
again and again from a more mature lady, whom
one admitted “portrait” shows to be a professor's
wife. Harcourt seems to have come under the same
influences as Lambert and the lately-dead Englishman
who painted “Diana of the Uplands.” His big “One
Summer Afternoon” is a purely decorative presentation
of a lady and two girl-children—he seems to have no
eyes for boys—under a spreading tree. It has already
been seen in the Royal Academy and one of the
Paris salons. Clever, also, is “The Smile” ; but more
attractive the work done from the other models, “The
Bouquet” and “Carmen.” The draped figure is Har-
court’s strong suit. The nude he does not touch in
this show, and the various landscapes are simply
negligible as compared with his strong figure-work.
A good job, too ! Australia is overflowing with com-
petent landscape painters already, and the gum-tree is
abundant in the land, likewise the wattle and the
bush fire and the old horse. But it is one of these
landscapes—a grey-skied day in an English harbor—
that the Art Gallery Board has recommended for pur-
chase. Private buyers in Adelaide already own some
of Harcourt’s best work.

At Melbourne Royal the wife of Potiphar
continues to offer Joseph more encourage-
ment than he knows what to do with. The
Temptation Scene is the one forcible item
in the drama of “Joseph and His Brethren,”
and if Miss Warwick, as the imploring lady,
and Tearle, as the unwilling young man,
were to play with a trifle more viyor, public
interest in the entertainment woufd be more
pronounced. Something to thrill the audi-
ence is the more necessary because there is
nothing to make one laugh, except Cam-
bourne’s impersonations of two different
Egyptian civil servants. Firstly, Cambourne
appears as governor of the Goshen Gaol, and
afterwards he is the trusted servant of
Joseph. In both characters his elocution,
his deportment and bis Nose lend an air of
modern Comedy to the proceedings.

“The Forty Thieves” have marched across

■ “The Rebel.” which is so strangely unlike
Allen’s other Dooneries, will present that
mild youilg divil of a hero in a bloodthirsty
capacity for one more week, and Melbourne
will be edified as much as it expected in con-
sequence. This is the only Hibernian drama
—as far as The Bulletin can remember —
in which Doone undertakes to slay the
villain, and acts accordingly. His rebellion
of ’9B is otherwise a dismal failure, but he
does at least rid the world of the spalpeen
who tried to annex his colleen, and the cur-
tain falls on the question whether he is
going to live happily ever afterwards or be
hanged without the option of a fine.

The “Smart Set” Entertainers are putting
in a farewell week or so at Melbourne
Athemeum Hall. The reappearance of this
well-balanced little co. in Melbourne is
another reminder that musical comedy of the
expensively elaborate sort begins to lag
superfluohs on the stage hereabouts.
“Dandies,” “Butterflies,” “Smart Sets,” etc.,
supply as much music with mere frivolity
as suffices to soothe the average citizen’s
brain when it is resting. The humor of
open-air or “drawing-room” entertainers has
an unrehearsed appearance, which is refresh-
ing, and even when their little stunts are
least fuhny the effect is less trying than
the failures of loud mummers who are labor-
ing pretentiously and mechanically on a
larger stage. The “Smart Set” entertain-
ment is neatly arranged; moreover, the co.
has some good, natural talent. Miss
Martin, singing character songs on her own
or doing a sketch with the genial Walter
George, is about the drollest little lady in
the business. Elliott’s ventriloquial turn
goes very near to making his dummy figure
an object of human sympathy, and the
ballad singers and the pianist do their duty
by. the show.

At Melbourne Olympia on Saturday
Charles Spencer screened “The Convent
Gate,” a long, sentimental story which has
the great honor of being devised by the
Marchioness Townsend. The yarn, which is
highly bellowdramatic throughout, deals
with a discreetly-filmed infidelity, seasoned
with raw piety and moral precept to make
it acceptable to Baptist palates. “The
Engineer’s Revenge” shows that retribution
deferred maketh the resolution weak, and
“Tell Tale Stains” describes how the tobacco
habit ruined a crook’s career.

At Melbourne King’s Ned Silverton is
still soaking his young intellect in hr-adv
fluids and repenting his thirst at the eleventh
hour. Also the villain, Mark Beveridge,
continues to accuse the young boozer of
theft and murder, and to be, in general, a
bad egg disguised in the clothes and man-
ners of a draper’s assistant. It must be
said for Mark, however, that the dramatist
allows him few opportunities to be a really
bad, explosive egg, and even his lurid femafe
accomplice is left comparatively speechless
at critical moments. The forces of evil
arrayed in “The Ninety and Nine” are there-
fore mild enough to be entirely negligible.

The Daunton Shaw cyclists were
the most notable first-appearers at Mel-
bourne Tivoli (late Opera House 1 on Satur-
day. The team comprises four flapper-aux-
iliaries and two expert males, the latter
demonstrating the infinite possibilities of
trick biking when conducted by young men
with a steady seat and a ready head. The
pole-balancing of the Graus Bros., which
has a Japanese aspect, is accepted with
thanks; and the world seems the brighter
when tuneful Talleur Andrews tells all he
knows of two “sparkling eyes,” as if reveal-
ing an awful secret. Also still entertaining
the curious is Miss Adelaide Waldorf, the
double-voiced warbler, who could not pos-
sibly strut with more importance if her
front name were Chicago or Constantinople.
By the way, has there ever been a feminine
entertainer called Miss Timbuctoo Smith or
Miss Sarah Jerusalem?
AT POVERTY POINT.
Consider the dread monotony of our usual Christ-
mas course at the theatres. The same features, largely
the same people, the same old jokes, the same old
legs.— Melb. weekly.
This is not fair. The tricks are old ;
The “features” are not strange!
The jokes have long been still and cold ;
The ragtime has the mange.
But when the chorus girls come out,
And wag their shins at you,
You will admit, without a doubt,
The legs are all bran new !
It remained for Quinlan to discover the makings
of a notable operatic tenor in Hector Goldspink, son
of a Carlton J.P. Hector had been singing occasion-
ally in Melbourne since Good Friday last year, when
lie revealed the results of his “European training” at
a concert in the Princess. He had just returned
from, a visit to Italy. The young man’s voice, ap-
pearance and style in general proclaimed him the
most promising of Australian tenors up to date, but
for a long time nobody wondered why local managers
didn’t talk about him until it transpired that Quin-
lan had heard Hector Goldspink, and had offered him
an engagement. He leaves for London on the 24th,
and will probably make his first appearance in grand
opera as Faust. A fairly tall, graceful and good-
looking tenor, with soul in his warble, doesn t need
a great voice. But the Goldspink voice is by way of
being somewhat great.
Marie Lolir, the Australian, has scored unmistak-
ably in Tree’s revival of “The Darling of the Gods,
in London. Critics are unanimous in her praise.
The Daily Telegraph says “she gains in power and
emotional truth with every part she plays, and there
has never been such passion in her acting as she gave
ns with Yo-San. She is the daintiest daughter of the
gods, marvellously disguised in lier Japanese sem-
blance, black-haired, flowing gowned and hugely
sashed.” And the Referee says it never saw “this
talented young actress” play “more passionately, ten-
derly or feelingly.”
The veteran Mrs. G. B. W. Lewis is still heard of as
a prosperous old Australian theatrical identity in the
Cold Country. The other week she scored flattering
notices and a cheque io match by giving her remin-
iscences at the Playgoers’ Club in Bristol. Her recent
Lbndon performance of the garrulous old Nurse in
“Romeo and Juliet” brought her a tempting offer to
play the part with an American touring co., but she
preferred to stick to the easier work of teaching a
Shakspearian class. For an old stager who knows her
business and can keep her name alive with an occa-
sional appearance in a big production, London is a
very good pitch for a school of “legitimate” acting.
One thing that St. Hilda's new Palais de Danse
has done is to enable at least two dear old ladies
to add a little to their attenuated incomes. Young
females are not admitted to the “Palay” unless
accompanied by a male or an elderly representative
of their own sex. Many a brace of girls, out on their
own, do not mind spending a couple of shillings on
a temporary “mother.” And if the girls do happen
to meet somebody they fancy, or who fancies them —
well, it is a mean “knut” who won’t butt off a
hired parent.
“Way Verley Penn”: With the foolish act of the
Adelaide Council as a warning, the Kalgoorlie Muni-
cipal Council has been guilty of the howling blunder
of leasing the local Town Hall to one Madorsky for
three years at £lOO a month. The morning after
thev had done it, eight Kalgoorfie councillors glee-
fully touted for applause for effecting a “good busi-
ness n»al.’ £lOO a month stood for £l2OO per
annum, and the hall revenue for the previous year
had only just got over the £lOOO mark, they
bleated. Ratepayers to a man and woman wouldn’t
compliment the councillors, but gibed at them for
virtually sentencing the town to a three years’ pic-
ture bill-of-fare, or whatever sort of show Madorsky
likes to turn on. The astute Hebrew can now ask
What he likes in sub-letting the hall. Back in
Mayor Rosenberg’s time, Mike Joseph (now of the
Fraser Film Co.) offered, on behalf of Harold Ash-
ton, to take a three years’ lease of the same Town
Hall at £4O per week, but no ebusiness resulted.
“Singemoine”: The cable announces the death of
“Professor Fox, the well known Australian snake
expert.” He wasn’t an Australian —as a matter of
fact, he was an Englishman—but he was on more
friendly terms with snakes than any native. For a
fee of a sovereign he would visit people’s houses,
snakes in hand, so to speak, and give demonstrations.
He came to my house one night for this considera-
tion, bringing with him 40 snakes in four sugar
bags. My guests and I sat on the backs of sofas, and
so on, while Fox toyed with his property on the
floor. Some he wound round his neck, some he
thrust down his back and shirt front, and he finished
the entertainment by offering to make any snake in
his collection bite him. He'segmed really sad when
the offer was turned down. He was a great showman
—the only good showman I have ever met in his line
of business. He wore his lank, yellow hair very long
and cut square behind, and affected a cheerily imbe-
cile expression of countenance which suggested
vaguely that he had been driven mad by the amount
of snake that he had absorbed into his system.
This he accentuated by his manner, which was delib-
erately eccentric. It was all very effective from a
professional standpoint. He made from three to five
pounds every Sunday, during the summer, at La
Perouse, where he gave exhibitions ; and a good deal
more during the week by extracting the poison from
the thousands of snakes which he had at his home at
Botany, and selling it to the University and similar
institutions. It was his firm conviction that no
snake could defeat his antidote, and he went to India
with the express intention of engaging a cobra. Why
a cobra I never clearly understood. It isn’t a par-
ticularly deadly reptile—nothing like so deadly, for
example, as the puff adder, or the lcrait, which ulti-
mately slew him. However, to Fox a successful
engagement with a cobra meant more than, gold and
rubies. As a matter of fact, about the only reptile
capable of destroying him —barring accidents of the
sort that happened in India —was a boa-constrictor.
“Harrison O.”: The chief value of “The Ninety
and Nine,” produced by the Bert Bailey company at
Melbourne King’s, is that it shows the futility of
trying to give a local appeal' to an imported play
merely by Australianising the names in it. “The
Ninety and Nine” is a Yankee moraldrama, which
wanders through one village called Boronia, and into,
another named Wattle Vale, and so on. Not much
care has been expended on the sub-editing of the
names of the characters, and Dick Sassafras finds him-
self in the company of Gene Hammers and Kate
Van Dyke. It was generally hoped that the success
of the Bailev-Duggan co. with Australian plays would
glue them to Australian authors; and the mere fact
that they thought it worth while to “localise’ this
Amurkan production shows that they still reckon
Australian interest is good from the box-office point
of view. Why, then, stage this hybrid stuff?
From London: Australia’s old friend, Henrietta
Watson, has turned up again this Chßistmas, as
“Mother” in one of the many children’s fairy plays.
Lewis Waller’s manager cables that his boss’s Beau-
caire was received in Melbourne with “scenes of
extraordinary enthusiasm.”! “Joseph and His
Brethren” is to come off after the 150th perform-
ance. Tree is going to replace it by a revival of
“The Darling of the Gods,” and then (probably) a
Copperfield play, himself taking on the sporting
double of Micawber and Peggotty. The hardy
annual, “Charley’s Aunt,” is having its seventh
successive Christmas run at tbe;«P£i|ce of Wales’,
and goes as well as ever ;, on the. otpaii hand, “Peter
Pan” is'missing this year. Little If ©by Claude is
giving a “Petite Gaby” turn at a suburban house.
George Edwardes boasts that he has had at “The
Girl From Utah,” within a fortnight, two kings
(Spain and Norway) and three queens. A lot of
princes and princesses also r,an.
Fred Niblo, in “Never Say Die,” at Sydney Cri-
terion, is a suggestion that he might exploit some
more of Charles Hawtrey’s parts in Australia. Niblo
is something of an American edition of Hawtrey as
regards cool audacity characterisation. Moreover, he
is a good deal younger, and is more clear in his
rapid utterance of words than the London man.
When the Coogee collided with the Bom-
bala in the Yarra last week, Melbourne had
another narrow escape from a trade blockade.
If either of the ships had sunk 'bind one day
a bumped shin will sink) all the boats above
the wreck would have been locked up without
the option until such time as the sunken
craft was raised. The old brown streak of a
river that floated Batman’s tqy craft does
very well for its size in swallowing the liners
and cargo-carriers that use it nowadays.
But it takes a special sort of hair-splitting
navigation, and some day when a pilot splits
the wrong hair the overworked ditch will
be closed indefinitely. Then there will be
the devil and a drove of infuriated ship-
owners to remunerate, and the folly of hav-
ing a State capital up a one-ketch creek will
be plain to every congested lunatic.
“Wallaby”: The luck of the drunk is
nothing compared to the luck of the Port
Jackson ferry cos. On Feb. 27 two of the
argosies, Kangaroo and Kirribilli, which
paddle after dividends for the Sydney Fer-
ries, Ltd., while rounding one of the multi-
tudinous corners of Our Beautiful, slopped
into one another. The result was disastrous
to the Kangaroo, but (and this is where the
luck of the co. stuck to it), it was an empty
ship, having just been taken off the run.
The collision completely demolished all one
side of its sitting accommodation, and, had it
been full, as it easily might have been, the
occupants would have had not a of
escape. It was a mere chance that the Kan-
garoo got the brunt of the collision instead
of the Kirribilli. Thus does Heaven look
after the lame, and lazy, the affluent, the
overcrowded the people who take too many
chances, and the pitcher that goes to the
well oftener than it should do.
The Aurora, with Douglas Mawson on
beard, slipped up quietly from the Antarctic
into Adelaide last week. Coming from as
far west as DO degrees, the vessel could
have struck any southern port with about
equal ease : but Mawson —Sydney born —has
been a lecturer in Adelaide University for
years, and it claimed the right of first wel-
come. Its Chancellor Way is also Chief
Justice, temporarily Lieutenant-Go /ernor,
and a master of diplomacy, and it was he
who got the function for Adelaide. The
Aurora still shows some marks of her bat-
tering by Antarctic ice. Mawson is fine-
drawn, and thinner in the thatch. He went
away a youth, and has come back a man.
He still hardly cares to talk of the time —
close on a month —when, after losing Ninnes
and the supplies down a crevasse, and Mertz
from sheer exhaustion, he pushed on alone
to his base, stormbeaten and nearly starved
all the way. If he were not a man of amaz-
ing vitality, it must have been the Scott
tragedy over again. D— the Antarctic,
anyway!
“Oyez”: That staid and decorous publica-
tion, N.S.W. Goveknment Gazette, con-
tributed a welcome note of hilarity in a
meat-stricken week by publishing on Feb-
ruary 23 a copy of a petition addressed by
Walter Bennett, politician, to Governor
Strjckland requesting that potentate to upset
the election of William Brown for the elec-
torate of Durham last December. The
petition, which, by the way, jovially de-
scribed the petitioner as “Water” Bennett,
started off as follows :
To His Excellency our trusty and well beloved Sir
Gerald Strickland, Count della Catena, Knight Grand
Cross of our most distinguished Order of Saint
Michael and Saint George, our Governor of our
State of New South Wales and its dependencies in
the Commonwealth of Australia.
If this is a copy of the document hurled at
Governor Strickland, I wish I had heard hisr.
language when that dragon for official eti-
quette perused the preamble, and realised:
that he was the trusty and well-beloved]
friend of Mr. “Water” Bennett. The pre-
amble, of course, was that used by the King-
when appointing persons by Commission..
How the error passed all hands is one of'
those things no printer can understand.

The other day a Hobart man was found
alive and floating in the Derwent River 31
hours after he had fallen in from the Naval
Pier. He had drifted not more than 300yds.,
and the wonder was that he had remained
on top of the water for so long without get-
ting to shore. The apparent explanation
of the mystery is the gentleman’s exceptional
stoutness. He floated as George Reid
would, if George stumbled off a pier and had
the presence of mind to turn upon his back
:and doze the hours away. Grease rises
naturally to the surface. Book how it floats
on top of the soup!
A recent unsuccessful action against the
manageress of a Melbourne “Home of
Rescue,” for alleged wrongful detention, dis-
closed some queer points of view. Plaintiff
had been put there by her husband to wean
her from an alleged passion for tanglefoot.
As the chief features of the “Home” were a
mangle, a wash-tub and a 12-foot wall topped
with barbed wire, she not unnaturally grew
bored with it. However, she was kept there
for six months. The jury found that the
mangling and so on had done her good, and
that she should be grateful to her kindly
husband, who had put these relaxations in
her way'. The matron opined that a husband
had the; right to keep a wife in such an in-
stitution “as long as he chose.” And from
these views neither the Judge nor anvone
else in court, barring the plaintiff, anneared
to dissent. It would be interesting to know
exactly how many “cases” there are at the
Home ; how long they have been there; how
long they are to stop, and whether they
have or have not any relatives desirous of
keeping them there, or friends desirous of
getting them out. The wash-tub is Jiut
usually regarded as a successful reformative
agent, though, if properl v managed and
served with plenty of cheap labor, it may be
a most profitable spec.

Poor old strangled Portland, through its
mayor, had the cold joy of signalling a wel-
come to the mailboat carrying the latest
imported State Governor past its deep and
neglected front door to the wandering shal-
lows of Port Phillip and the loyal fuss of
congested Melbourne. A few toy flags flut-
tered on the lighthouse flagstaff on top of
towering Cape Bridgewater, and the ocean
was informed that “Portland welcomes our
Governor —Williamson, mayor.” Then a
few colored specks crawled up the signal
halyards of the mailboat: “Their Excel-
lencies thank you, and wish prosperity to
Portland.” By the' tiine that signal had
been made, the boat —like prosperity —was
well past the place, and the sea looked as
empty as a compliment. When Stanley, at
the end of his term, passes Portland on his
way back to England, he will see Portland
still waiting on its cliffs for its splendid but
mislaid future.

From the Oldest Inhabitant: —
One ot the few remaining bits of Old Sydney is
coming down—the building on the corner of Grosvenor
and George streets, built by Samuel Lyons in 1833,
as shown on the coping stone. Montgomery Martin,
writing in 1836, said that it contained the finest
room south of the line. It doesn’t look much now,
but in its day and generation people thought it was
a work that' would last almost for ever. In this
room Sam Lyons carried on the business of an auc-
tioneer until his death in 1851. There, too, was
held the meeting of merchants at which it was deter-
mined to erect an Exchange and establish a Chamber
of Commerce. After the death of the owner the
building was converted into offices. Lyons also built
0 8421 a big terrace in Liverpool-street, a part of
which has been demolished to make a new thorough-
fare. The George-street ground originally belonged
to John Jamison, who cut it up and sold it in the
early ’3o’s. Lyons’s two lots brought £25 per
foot. Before Jamison got his grant—and that was in
the very early davs —the cottage of the Lieutenant-
Governor was on the site; and there the first oak
trees seen in Australia were planted.

CHATRMAN OT DIRECTORS (at the firms annual dinner): “ Gentlemen, it affords me great

The weird sentence which Judge Eagle-
son, of Victoria, imposed on a couple of
offenders the other day (viz., that they
should abstain from both drinking or gamb-
ling for the terms of their natural lives,
under penalty of 18 months hard) will take
a bit of obeying. It is easy enough to keep
off the drink, but which of us can undertake
never to gamble? A gamble “of any kind”
will bring them within the grin of the law,
said the Judge. So, presumably, they may
not go' on the Stock Exchange, nor invest
money in exploration or mining syndicates,
nor purchase any shares in any company,
nor buy a Tatt.’s ticket, nor have a flutter
in Melbourne Tramway stock, nor buy Vic-
torian Government bonds, nor invest in
anything which is in the slightest degree
an affair of hazard—and everything in this
life is a matter of hazard. They may not
even marry; or have children (the biggest
gamble of all); or cross a street; or eat
tinned food; or take any one of the million
chances which mankind is heir to on every
day that passes. Of course, they inevitably
will, and when Judge Eagleson discerns one
of them taking some such even money toss-
up with Death as consists (say) in eating
oysters in March he is quite naif and un-
worldly enough to feel hurt about the occur-
rence.

Melb. Age, with the kindest and most
grovelsome intention, noticed that the new
Gov. of Victoria had “an attractive lisp.”
As a matter of fact, the young man with
the iron-grey hair is less decidedly “lithpy”
than Malcolm Tearle, the juvenile lead in
“Joseph and His Brethren.” Stanley’s occa-
sional mannerism of speech is due to the
ordinary English thickness of tongue, or
some other internal characteristic of the
bull-dog breed. He talks like one who has
been through a laborious course of training
in elocution, and will be all right with his
“r” and his “w” when he is not nervous.
At any rate, he-, is an improvement on most
of his predecessors in the billet. Carmichael
was halting and indistinct in his speech-
making, and the. recent John Fuller was a
jerky person, who had nothing to say and
sahTit rather incoherently, as a rule. Stan-
ley has no traditions to beat- in the way of
local vice-regal oratory—always excepting
the eloquence of John Madden, of course.
The local press has evidently determined
to love him to distraction. But it was a
rather disconcerting idolatry which compli-
mented the young man on his “attractive
lisp.”
The Adelaide Register, collecting opinions
of various local parsons on the word. “obey"
in the marriage service, got only two worth
mentioning. The others either said that
they had dropped it in their own churches,
or that the Bible said so, and that settled
it. R.C. Archbishop, Q’Reily called the word
“stupidly superfluous,” because “the woman
who is not prepared to obey will never make
a good wife, and the husband who takes her
makes a very silly bargain.” The other par-
son, having had American experience, re-
garded marriage as “a mutual business,”
legal rather than religious. In the U.S.A.
“they don’t even have a ring half the time.”
“I think,” said this cheerful Yankee, “it
would be better for men to be pledged to
obey women. They’ve mostly got to do it,
anyhow.”

Dear Bulletin, —It is cabled from Lon-
don that the Christian Commonwealth—
whatever that may be —-has denounced a
publication called “A Sight of Hell,” written
by a Catholic priest, and described as “a
book for children.” This news is like a
voice from the Middle Ages. The-“ Sight of
Hell” was probably the most unlimited hor-
ror ever issued in the name of religion. It
was Dante without a shred of Dante’s refine-
ment. Everything in it was murky, bound-
less, red-hot, boiling and unspeakable. The
writer told how,, after billions of ages of
frying on the gridiron of Tophet, the punish-
ment of the boy who went to a theatre, or
the infant who misappropriated a penny
which should have gone into the plate, had
hardly even commenced. There were folk
who roasted inwardly and breathed flames,
and girls who begged to be let off the red-
hot floor for one secord in all eternity and
were refused, and living human cinders who
asked the time, in the hope that things
might be near an end, and were told that time
had entirely ceased. Pages were filled with
these wild hot shocks. The book had a sort
of drunken and combustible vigor which
carried weight with the young and fliterate.
Even in the early 70’s of last century some
boys and girls ran wild and committed sui-
cide after reading it. I really thought the
thing had gone out of print or been burned
by the common hangman a generation ago.
If it is the same old unamended book it
ought to be burned by the common hangman
now, supposing a sufficiently common one can
be found. Failing him the common lunatic
might do. —Yours, etc.. Henry llokse-
COLLAR.
WHO PAYS?
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
It appears that at the beginning of May, 1913, the
Katoomba Town Hall was engaged for a meeting, at
which speeches were delivered by certain prominent
members of the Liberal party. There was much
political enthusiasm and the meeting was declared
to have been a pronounced success ; but the enthusi-
asm did not last long enough for the promoters of
the movement to collect the fees payable for the hire
of the hall. The secretary of the local Liberal Asso-
ciation does not admit liability, and others who
have been appealed to pass it on with monotonous
uniformity.- —Sydney Sun.
The Liberal howls that woke the Mount
A year ago won’t pay
The town clerk’s little hire account
That lingers still to-day.
The patriots who shrieked and stamped
Their hero Wade to get
Have, like a flight of crows, decamped
And all is doubt and debt.
'Theirs not to reason why—or pay!
The battle was not won ;
.And so the town clerk is to-day
An angry, puzzled dun.
The Cause is there, the man is there,
The hall is plain to see.
Where stands the Liberal who will hear
The cost of oratory? •
Ah, who can pay with silent shrieks
The man who runs the show ?
<or plug the State’s financial leaks
With last year’s bluff and blow?
Word haystacks melt before the wind
And towers of blither fall;
And Someone roars, in anger blind,
“WHO’S PAYING FOR THE HALL?”

“Singemoine” writes: —
And so the latest to claim to have been the origi-
nal “Bubbles” of the notorious picture is a profligate
cabman, who, by the look of the cable, only laid
down the beer-bottle in order to be completely un-
hampered in the business or sport of kicking his
wife. This makes about the 40th original “Bubbles”
that I have either met or heard of in my time. The
same mysteriousness attaches to this character as we
find surrounding' such questions as the birth-place of
Homer, the nationality of Gladstone, the legal iden-
tity of a place, and so on. The last “Bubbles” I
saw in the flesh was in Sydney on a British warship
the other dav. He had hair that was not so much
red as pink, and an immense mouth. Still, time and
a sea-life work wonders in the way of ravagement.
His story was, I believe, that he had been less
awful in infancy ; so much so that Millais, who was
a friend of his father’s, shouted with approbation on
first seeing him, and began the dreadful soap picture
there and then. I met an elderly German in Dieppe
about 10 years ago who said he was “Bubbles.” He
was unsober, and cried a good deal as he described
the way Millais used to pose him. As a matter of
courtesy, I cast no doubts on his story, but I re-
member calculating at the time that unless his appear-
ance belied him he must have been about 30 years
of age when the picture was done. A schoolfellow
of mine once claimed to be “Bubbles,” but a united
assault on the part of his young friends cured him
for life. It is curious this passion for vicarious
glory. Norman Lindsay has a double—a futile liar
who wanders from bar to bar, in Sydney; informing
the listless and disinterested beer-pullers that he is
I'he Bulletin’s pub-hating artist friend. Heaven
knows what gratification he gets out of it. Even
1, the writer, have an impersonator. I have never
seen him, but I know of his existence by the steady
stream of ill-spelt letters and post-cards which flows
in on me from illiterate young women to whom he
has made love in my name. Is this reliance on the
potency of somebody else’s name or fame a manifesta-
tion of conceit or utter humility? The latter I
think. What infinite pathos there is in the man
whose chief distinction is the fact that he sat for
a picture that presently became a soap advertisement 1

Out in the Pilliga (N.S.W.) scrub a
woman was living alone with four young
children. Her husband was away at work ;
her nearest neighbors were six miles off.
On the Saturday, about 2 p.m., she dropped
at the clothes line in a fit. Her eldest boy.
10i years old, seeing his mother fall, rushed
to her assistance. He put a blanket on the
ground for her to lie on, and a pillow under
her head. Procuring wet rags, he laid them
on her forehead, and covered her face and
hands to keep off the flies. Then he
gathered up all the clothes he could find
belonging to his little brother and baby
sister; locked up the house, put the two
children into a box on wheels, and, taking
two loaves of bread, four eggs, and some
matches —-“in case we knocked up and had
to camp out”—Started off to pull the cart six
miles through bush —ith the temperature
over 100° in the shade. He did it, too,
arriving at his destination just before dark.
The Sydney paper which reported his doings
gave him very little space, but it spared a
whole column to the hobbies of a musical
comedy “tart.”
UNPLEASANT HEARING.
HE : “I would like to know why you refuse to
marry me?"
SHE : “Pardon me, but I don't think you
would."
BY THE SKIN OF HIS TEETH.
“Well, anyhow, that newspaper cat can't help
noticing my gown this time,"
“Possibly, my dear, possibly. But if there had
been a little less of it it would be un-
noticeable."
At the ; Glebe (N.S.W.) bobby or cop
court, on a recent day, a woman sued her
husband for maintenance and was blown out.
It seemed that she had asrreed, in considera-
tion of £2O, to go forth permanently into a
cold world and make no more trouble, and
the agreement, wonderful to relate, held good.
The bargain was wholly lopsided, for the
third party wasn’t consulted. Either the
woman (No. 1) must support herself, which
she apparently was not able to do ; or her
husband (No. 2) must support her; or the
cost of her sustenance must be charged to
the public (No. 3). So No. 1 being beguiled or
persuaded or coerced by No. 2, they agreed
(Nos. 1 and 2) to leave the responsibility to
No. 3. who wasn’t consulted. Poor old No.
3 is always being left in wav« like that.
“H. 0.”: I doubt not that “J.
Pannikin” and others, in their
divagations West o’ Sunset and
Back o’ Old Man Plain, have
come across many strangely-
named pubs. Here, in Mel-
bourne, conservatism and syco-
phancy seem to have been
the guiding principles of the
forefathers of the hamlet’s
beer-numps. I have personal
knowledge of the Dooks of
Edinburgh, York, Kent, Buck-
ingham. Wellington, Albany
and Devonshire; of the Markiss
of Lome and the belted earls
of Zetland and Lincoln. I have
also taken refreshment in four
London Taverns, the most fam-
ous being the old one in Eliza-
beth-street, which has laielv
been rebuilt. Hereabouts, too,
there are at least half a dozen
Georges (notably the one at
St. Kilda, which is about the
largest pub in Watt’s State),
and Royals are as numerous as
currant buns at a Sabbath-
school picnic. Strange to say,
the idea of naming pubs ifter
girls does not seem to have
occurred to more than one or
two persons, although there are
three Village Belles in the
Yarra city. Pubs with more
or less unusual names are the
Old Lamb in Elizabeth-street,
the Adam and Eve, the Anchor
arid Hope, and the Cherry Tree
(the last two in Richmond), the
Labor in Vain and the Perseverance
'(both in Fitzroy), the Early Bird and the
Shakespeare, North Melbourne being the
suburb in which Bung delights to honor the
Bard. Carlton has a Baden-Powell, but if
it lives up to its name there is more froth
than body in its pewters.
The discussion on the
morals of Port Adelaide
still goes on. Since they
were attacked by par-
son Lionel Fletcher,
they have received tes-
timonials from Attor-
ney-General Homburg,
Governor Bosanquet (a
sailor himself) and R.C.
Archbishop O’Reily—
who probably don’t know
much about the water-
side bars and two-up
schools. An anonymous
traveller now bursts in
with a different yarn.
“Mostly everybody,” he
says, “knows a little of
the colossal gambling of
the Port. If you chat
with some of the men
on the wharf it would
be a revelation.... 1
have visited, profession-
ally and frequently, all
the chief seaports of the
world. I do not think
that in any other Eng-
lish-speaking port I have
had to listen to such dis-
gusting, revolting, ab-
horrent language as in
Port Adelaide. ... Sail-
ors come here and per-
fect their vocabulary of
blasphemy.” But if
that's all that’s the mat-
ter with Port Adelaide,
the population has prob-
ably been merely visit-
ing Moonta lately. You
can’t beat the cousin
Jack miner of those
parts for religion; yet
win a it comes to lan-
guage—well, ask ex-
Premier Jack Verran,
who is a “local
preacher” himself.
“Pick’ : Under the present system every
member of a rifle club is required to share
his gun with four others; and this fool
regulation does more towards killing the Re-
servist movement than any of the many other
disadvantages under which riflemen struggle.
“What is everyone’s business is no one’s
business”; so the rifle, for want of proper
attention, Soon becomes unserviceable,
whereupon five riflemen, disgusted with
their inferior success at the targets, drop
out. Any member of a rifle club may, it is
UNREASONABLE.
MOTHER: “ Why are you so unkind io poor Fido, Tommy?"
TOMMY: “He won't do as he’s told."
MOTHER: “Well, you should coax and pat him pettily.”
TOMMY: “Well, why don't you treat me like that?"
true, purchase his gun; but that means
£3 15s. 9d., or with up-to-date appliances,
£5, or thereabouts. To the man who keeps
himself in constant practice a new barrel
(£2 15s. or upwards) is also required every
third year or less. As a consequence, only
the pot-hunter or first-rate enthusiast sticks
to rifle practice; aid that's no good to A„s-
tralia, which, being dismally short of men,
requires that every physically-fit one of
tliem shall be a marksman.
The Argus, with sedate Tory rapture,
spoke thus of the arrival of Governor Stan-
ley and family :
Everywhere, in some mysterious way, they called
forth an unusual display of warmth and enthu-
siasm.
Seeing that bands of school children were
stationed at definite spots to burst into rap-
ture at a given signal on the approach of
his Ex., and that lines of cadets were there
to link up the bursts of rapture, the paper
that could find anything mysterious, occult
or enigmatic in the display is very easily
taken in.
An Adelaide paper assures its readers
that there is more in George Reid “than
appears on the surface.” Well, unless he
carried his last meal in his hand there must
be.
T H E MOTOR-OAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Alderman W. P. McElhone, chairman of the finance
committee, stated that the proposal for the purchase
of the car had not emanated from Alderman Richards,
but had come from the speaker. He (Alderman
McElhone) had felt that it was not dignified for a
cord Mayor to have to use his own private car lor
the many official visics mat had to be paid. the
motion was carried. —Item from typical important
debate in Sydney 'City .C«ocil.,
I must confers it grifyeg .me some,
When all tire, nobs .assembled are,
To see Lord Dicky Richards come
In such a measly motor-caT ;
He ought to move in spangled pride,
Dressed in a coat of rabbit-skin ;
With flunkeys, sitting on the side,
And coats-of-arms outside and in.
It’s grand to hear him called “My Lord.”
Instead of “Dicky,” as of yore;
And surely Sydney can afford
To boost him up a little more.
It only wants a trifling rate
To give his dignity a show,
And lift him into proper state ;
And what’s a motor-car or so?
We’ve half a dozen here and there ;
Inspectors use ’em more or less.
And when his’ I 'Lordship takes the air
We want a bigger splash, I guess.
He never ought to. move around
Without a lot- of frill and fuss ;
And when with glory h ' is crowned,
A bit of it belongs to us.
So whoop for Dignity and Splash,
And buy another car or nvo:
There’s somebody to find the cash —
It won't be paid by me or you.
And when in pride his Washup swanks
And toots his passage through the crowd,
The multitude will say with thanks:
“We bought it, and it does us proud.”

The printer does not always make use of
his opportunities. The other day the papers
published a report to the effect that, while
in Adelaide, this country’s Dry Commis-
sioner. had become indisposed, owing to the
excessive HEAT and not one paper dropped
the unnecessary “h.”
A change in the ancient firm of Gibbs,
Bright and Co. is announced ; the evergreen
“Reggy” Bright is retiring. “Reggy” came
to Australia in the Great Britain in 1852,
and is now 80 years of age. His brother,
Charles E., who married a daughter of Lord
Canterbury, one-time Governor of Victoria,
came a couple of years later. The firm
started business in Lonsdale-street West
Melbourne, but in 1854 removed to Flinders-
lane. C. E. Bright is now 85 years of age
and is still a figure in London society. The
Gibbses are persons of tremendous tonnage
in English banking and commerce.
THE PRIDE OF
LAUNCESTON—
BOB SADÈR,
M. H. A. (Tas.).
The cotton-
spinning firm of
Coats continues
to be a good
friend to the
British revenue.
Another Coats
passed out re-
cently, making
the fifth who
lias paid the last debt of nationality
within a few months. One was a
mere outsider, who left only a quarter
of a million sterling for the Government to
collect from. The other four averaged about
two millions each, and collectively the de-
ceased have been worth a million in probate
duties. All made out of the British Thread
Trust.
Peacock’s cackle has reached the Fog. The
owner of the weird thing was among the Vic-
torian . Ministers who went down Hobson’s
Bay in the Hygeia to meet the new
Governor. When a happy party had
got together, Stanley began to talk
about Victoria, its productions and so
forth, and the first of the great natural
resources he mentioned was Peacock’s laugh.
Declaring that he wouldn’t be happy till' he
heard it, he waited—and of course the noisy
showman obliged with the best he had.
According to Melbourne Argus (23/2/T4)
George Reid’s secretary telegraphed from
Mount Gambier to Adelaide last week as
follows:
Owing to the awful heat the High Commissioner
greatly regrets that he must cancel all his Adelaide
engagements, except! perhaps, luncheon with Minis-
ters on day of his departure.
It is cheering to know that, as regards at
least one important side of his job, there is
no force in existence that is capable of pre-
venting Gried from facing the music.
Golding-Bird, first Anglican bishop for
the Goldfields diocese (Westralia), is a
comparatively young ploughman in the vine-
yard, though he has seen service in East
London and West London, in the Boer War
at Dover, the Falkland Islands and New-
castle (N.S.W.). He is a firm believer in
the idea of the Church being really militant
here on earth, and his utterances in New-
castle Cathedral on mere bloke-like affairs
have attracted wide notice. In the last big
Newcastle strike he shook out a reef in his
surplice and sailed into both sides for plung-
ing the State into industrial war. Nobody
heaved a beer bottle at him, which might go
to show that nobody had a spare beer bottle
with him in the Cathedral, or that he was
atraid the cleric might throw it back. He
looked as if he might be a dangerous throw-
back if lie once started to shoot bottles at
the godless.
Albert Dorrington, the Australian writer,
has lately been pulling the Spaniard’s leg
through La Illustracion Artistica, which
has been printing “The Radium Terrors.”
And, as further showing that the “Alba
Dorion” of old has achieved something of
an international reputation, a German firm,
after one satisfactory experiment, is this
year publishing two of his books —“The
Half God” and “A South Sea Buccaneer.”
“The Religious Editor” : Munro-Ferguson,
so the cable murmurs, has been ordained an
elder of the Scotchbyterian Church, so Mo-
Ferg will probably use his influence as G.-G.
to make Melbourne observe the Sabbath.
And Melbourne observes the Sabbath beauti-
fully. It is an ideal city to be buried in on
Sunday. The people have nothing else to
do but look at funerals. a~d the streets are
so straight and level that every funeral can
be watched for miles. But, whatever hap-
pens, it will be a change for the little vice-
regal procession to go up the Collins-street
hill t" Scots’, instead of turning in at the
convenient and noisv St. Paul’s, which is so
placed that it always seems to be praying
exclusively for the Flinders-lane warehouses.
John Blakeney, editor of Sydney Free-
man’s Journal, has gone where the most
inveterate pressman has a rest at last. He
was an able man, a mine of information, a
hard worker, a good friend, a very inferior
enemy because he seldom took the trouble
to really hate anybody, and a person who
didn’t advertise. The hand which he didn’t
require to hold the stick which propped his
faltering footsteps was extended in friend-
ship and kindliness to almost everybody.
RJakeney was gone in the feet as a sort of
Mbit. Gout and rheumatism were invented
when the world was young, and he had more
than his share of one, or both. So he died
leaving much good work done and much un-
done, while people who have nothing wrong
with them save swelled head live on.
From “H. 1.0.” :
Randolph Bedford is relying on a rotten premise
when, apropos Jimmy Tyson, he says that the men
who were responsible for the internal development
of Australia were innocent of culture. As far as
the pastoral industry is concerned, nothing could be
farther from the truth. The men who opened up
Queensland, at any rate, were, almost without excep-
tion, well educated. The Leslies, the Sandemans, de
Satge, the Rowe brothers, the Jardines, were only a
f?', v ili a long list. They had their counterparts, too,
in other States. In this connection, it is characteris-
tic of Randolph that he can only picture Lord
Chesterfield, a great Ambassador, and one of the best
Lord Lieutenants Ireland eVer had, as a Groom of
the Bedchamber. I do not quarrel with Tyson’s
spook because the old man wore strange garments,
but because his attitude on this question was one of
posing pure and simple. An ordinary, decent get-up
would have put him in the ruck. His clobber or
garniture brought him the neck-craning, the stage
whispers and the subservience of the crawlers which
his vain, mean old soul loved next to Money.
Dr. F. W. Taylor, of Queensland, just
appointed chairman of next year’s Medical
Conference, which is to be held in Brisbane,
is a dapper, unassuming little man—to the
eye a typical “family practitioner.” Hence,
when, in the Q. Legislative Council, he
battled furiously against the repeal of the
C.D. Acts, he surprised everyone. So well
did he strive against odds that provisions
practically similar to those of the repealed
Acts were dropped into the new Health Bill,
in spite of the Holy Joe Ministry, which
sent the measure back twice. Forced to
accept the new clauses, Home Sec. Appel
declared that they did not matter, as they
could only become operative by special pro-
clamation, and he would answer for it that
no such proclamation would ever issue. Now,
only about 12 months later, the necessary
proclamation has issued, and Appel has been
busy consuming his own smoke.
Robert Singleton, accountant and sur-
veyor, who has just died in Melbourne, was
a pensioner from the Victorian railways,
where he had served from field-assistant and
draughtsman to accountant. The Single-
tons have had a remarkable capacity for
varied work. Robert’s uncle was the old
Irish doctor who set up an establishment in
Collingwood (Vic.) for the healing of soul
and body. He started a free dispensary,
and in connection with it had a Christian
Mission. Both institutions were well
patronised by crowds from the “Flat” and
the surrounding suburbs. Besides giving
medicine and spiritual advice free, “the old
Doctor” always found a sixpence in his
pocket for any poor devil who said he had
nothing to eat and nowhere to sleep. Robert,
his nephew, who has just died at 73, was ip
the Victorian railways from 1858 to 1901.
Till lately the Parliamentary wage in
Tasmania was three pounds a week, and now
it is only four; and electioneering exes, mop
up a lot of it, because under the
Clark system the districts are big and not
easily worked. So the Labor members mostly
run a side-line. The hustling Dicker adver-
tises that he personally conducts the tourist
at reasonable rates. Jack Earle, the leader,
runs a newspaper shop. Two others are
freelance journalists. Giblin, one of the
bulkiest politicians in the Commonwealth,
who dresses like Hayseed going out to bring
the cows in, runs an orchard or something.
Most of the others are trades-union secre-
taries —which is nearly as precarious a job
as freelance press work.
Regarding Jacomb, the young Englishman
who has published a book of curses about
this countiy and all its contents, a Svdney
Sun reviewer made this remark:
While in Australia he married. He became ex-
tremely bitter against everything Australian.
Perhaps the Sun man didn’t see his own
epigram. Perhaps he did. Anyhow he left
it at that.

“Lud” : Old-man Tenniel is dead, at 94 —
old-man Tenniel, who for years and years
was on London Punch as artist or car-
toonist, but never caricaturist. Jerrold re-
commended him when Doyle resigned through
attacks on his Church, the Pope having been
depict as Sairey Gamp. A lot of nonsense
was talked about Leech being deposed from
the job of contributing a weekly cartoon in
favor of Tenniel. Leech’s cartoons were
always inferior. His genius, like Du Maur-
ier’s, did not lie that way. Sambourne and
the others who replaced Tenniel have never
been able to hit a grand style, or achieve qnp
cartoon that is a topic, like Tenniel’s of Pal:
merston, Gladstone, Disraeli. Napoleon' 111.,
and Bismarck. The artistic world is’ apt to
give the palm to Keene, but if he parhpd it
at all it was only for his technique.'

Australia. His car-
eer in this country
was eventful. He
went to the Terri-
tory from Queens-
land with a mob of
cattle. These either
died or were lost
en route, and the
amateur stockman
was stranded. He
went in for carry-
ing with pack-
horses, and for
mining; that is, he
let tributes in his
old age to the Chi-
nese. Also he had
great hopes of a
future prosperity
founded on raising
goats. For over a
flecade he dwelt ip
a bark humpy with
a thatched roof,
and for the last
few years under a
roof without any
sides. In the wef
season there was
often 2ft. of water
under his bunk.
He gnawed salt
beef while his
grinders lasted;
and he drank
square-face ; and in
spite of all this
care, an awful cli-
mate killed him at
71. John Cleland,
now in Melbourne,
is 71 too, and he
has been roughing
it for nearly a
quarter of a century in the Far North.
And Dick Webb, at 73, has gone over to
Melville Island with a saw mill to cut tim-
ber.
THE MUNICIPAL PATRIOT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Aid. Richards (Lord Mayor), replying, said it
was no joke being- Lord Mayor of Sydney. (Laughter.)
He called them “comrades in arms,” because he
recognised that th'-- were members of a vast con-
cern equipped for the security not only of the city
of Sydney, but of an area beyond its boundaries. He
was fully aware of the responsibilities that he had
undertaken when he was elected to his present posi-
tion ; but he was soldier enough to sav that when
any fighting was necessary, lie would be ‘there.
—Report of a Sydney regimental dinner.
It was Alderman Richards, the brand-new Lord
Mayor
As rose up in state from ’is banquetin’ chair,
And made a speech, wavin’ one ’and in the air.
E was dressed in ’is robes like an old dressin’-gown.
An’ the rabbit-skins on ’im in long strips ’ung down]
While th’ chain round ’is neck made ’im look like a
dog.
Rut ’e looks at th’ officers sinpin’ their grog,
An’ ’e winds ’imself up in ’is bedgown for biz,
An' re-marks it ain’t no joke to be wot ’e is.
An’ that gets ’im a laugh. Then, obscurin’ ’is charms
With that nightdress, ’e calls them “ ’is comrades
in arms”
Well, that stung ’em, you bet, but they took it
orlright,
So ’e spread out ’is wings, an’ ’e took a big flight,
Sayin’ Sydney was not all they ’ad to defend
There was Somethin’ beyond th’ last suburb’s dim
end.
If you went to th’ very last lamp post ’e knew,
There was something like mountains quite plain to
the view.
’E ’ad ’eard it described as “the rest of th’ State,”
An it couldn t he killed with a stiff railway rate.
’E ’ad ’eard people call it “a mere ’owlin’ waste,”
That was ’owlin’ for somethin’ to fill it in ’aste.
But it couldn’t be filled up with Sydney’s tame
’ordes
Till no landlord ’ad ’ouses or land-agent boards,
An’ each patch o’ land ’ad been cut up an’ built on.
Yet ’is own flamin’ blood would be cheerfuW spilL-ty*'
■Whatever was there' 'cause' '{'stooTbeTnd Sydney,
An’ appealed to all patriots of ’is own kidney.
’E ’ad ’eard several times indirectly of late
That this wild savige region was part of th’ State,
An’ he’d said to himself, as he stood by th’ lamp
Where his by-laws left off, an invader might tramp
Through that same blessed place to his own little
throne
In th’ city where ’e knew each buildin’ an’ stone.
So ’e offers, in chain an’ in rabbit-skin, too,
Through that dim land o’ devils to curse an’ pursoo
All blokes who would bust up his by-laws an’ bins,
An’ flirt on th’ way with th’ wilderness gins.
(An’ th’ wind hums a wild an’ a desolate strain
As it ruffles ’is rabbits and rattles ’is chain.)
It was Alderman Richards, th’ dauntless Lord Mayor,
As sat with flushed face in ’is banquetin’ chair. k ,
Ah, ’is stummick was ’ere, but ’is spirit was ‘there!

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Australia has an ther peaceable visitor —
Professor Jordan, of Stanford University, California,
lie has a profound contempt for defence, and one of
his statements is thus reported:—
For a very small sum I will undertake to insure
Australia against a Japanese invasion.
Australia has already met with some shamelessly in-
solvent insurance companies, and the most imperti-
nent and bumptious and inflated and dishonest of the
lot came from Jordan’s own country. Still, Jordan
may be all right, even though his financial record
can’t be found in Bradstreet. The questions arise:
What premium does he ask to insure Aus-
tralia against Japanese invasion? How much
will he insure for? How much capital has
he to pay losses with? What is his reserve
rund ? Will he stay here so that he can be found
when the claim falls due, or will he retire early?
Will he consent to be hanged if he pays less than Id.
in the £ of his liabilities? And will he, as a sort of
preliminary canter, insure Sydney or Melbourne
against burglary, embezzlement, pocket-picking, sneak-
thieving, robbery with violence and common assault,
so that the police may be dispensed with? If he
will take on this simple line of business we will be
able to decide, before the Professor has fled, or burst
on a ruinous scale, whether he is a reliable financier
or a fraud and a three-card trick. A new insurance
company should begin with small risks, and work up
to bigger things when it has earned a reputation
by honesty and reliability. The offer of an un-
registered concern with an unknown and unstated
capital to insure Australia against Japanese aggres-
sion is too much like the sort of business pursued
by Tigg Montague’s Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested
Loan and Insurance Co., of which David Crimple was
secretary.

The wicked unions have cut the profits like that,
and the wickedest of them all is the Journalists’
Association, because the journalist might at least
have been expected to be a gentleman even if his
trousers were frayed. However, he has sordidly pre-
ferred to have better trousers; and the Daily Tele-
graph’s profits are smitten in consequence. It is
really too late for the D.T. or anyone else to throw
stones at a gentleman for being a trades-unionist;
they would all be far better occupied in throwing
bricks at those trades-unionists who won’t be gentle-
men —who make agreements only to break them ;
who take the best money the employer can give, and
give in return only their second- or third-best ser-
vice. Tall wages certainly do harass some employers,
especially those who, like the farmers, have to find
their principal market in foreign countries, and
can’t pass the increases on. But a far greater
trouble to most is, not that they have to pay high
wages, but that they don’t know what wages they
will have to pay for a reasonable time ahead, agree-
ments made with employees being now of very little
value —except to the employees.
Still, there are few lambs to whom the wind has
been better tempered than to the people who got
early into the Telegraph. For a few years it was
a struggle; then, getting firmly on its feet, it saw
that it was desirable, in order that the dividend
shouldn’t appear to be too outrageous, to begin capi-
talising accumulated profits; and the process has
now become a habit or a hobby. In 1897 the capital
was £50,000; now, though no money has been actu-
ally paid in since by shareholders, it is £266,666.
The movement has been as follows: —
1897 .. .. £50,000 1906 .. ..£120,000
1898 .. .. 57,500 1907 .. .. 133,100
1899 .. .. 60,100 1908 .. .. 150,000
1900 .. .. 66,100 1909 .. .. 165,000
1901 .. .. 66,100 1910 .. .. 181,500
1902 .. .. 75,000 | 1911 .. .. 199,650
1903 . . . . 85,000 | 1912 . . . . 219,620
1904 .. .. 100,000 ' 1913 .. .. 250,000
1905 . . . . 110,000 | 1914 . . . . 266,666
So the 12* p.c. div. to-day is worth 66 p.c. to the
man who held shares at par in 1897. As, in addition, he
this year gets one new free share for every three
that he held in 1897 (provided he has gone on hold-
ing them), and as his free share is worth about
£65. it follows that the market value of the year’s
bonus is £2l 13s. 4d. for every old £lO share. As
the year’s bonus has been rather less than the avei-
age for many years past, it is scarcely an exaggera-
tion to say that the original shareholder has done
pretty well.
The present-day investor who comes in at £65 is
on a different wicket altogether. Suppose the bonuses
for the next few years average one in 10 (last year’s
was one in 15; for the year before, one in nine).
Then his dividend on an investment of £650 will
be as follows ; First year, £l2 10s. ; second, £l3 15s. ;
-bird. £l5 2s. 6d. ; fourth, £l6 12s. 9d.; fifth,
£lB 6s. Id.; sixth, £2O 2s. Bd. ; seventh, £22 35.:
eighth, £24 7s. 3d. To make 4 p.c. on £650 you
must get £26 a year; so, paying £65 per share
now, and piling up the annual bonus shares at the
rate of one new for every 10 old, the investor at the
end of nine years will be drawing 4 p.c., and not
before then. At the end of that time, he may be
able to sell out his shares at the present price (in
which case he will make a nice little £650, having
bv that time doubled his holding) ; but present
prices can only rule then in the expectation that bon-
uses will still go on until the shares are again more
than doubled (that is to say, until the capital is
increased to nearly £1,250,000) ; and though that
is possible, there is a sizeable risk about it. There
is a limit to the profit-earning power of even a
daily newspaper. In fact, there is a very large pro-
bability that the co. won’t be' able to average any-
thing like a bonus of one in 10 during the next
nine years. In that case, it will be more than
nine years before the investor at £65 gets a 4 p.c.
return. The chances are by no means improved by
the almost-certain appearance of a Labor daily in
Sydney during the next couple of years or less. The N. S.
Wales unions have already put up £95,000 for that
enterprise; and though it is all sunk in city free-
hold premises, another £60,000 is being whipped
up to buy machinery and to finance the concern;
and even if the £60,000 doesn’t arrive, though
£30,000 is said to be assured, it would be quite
easy to raise the money from the N.S.W. Labor
party’s new-found friend Cohen on the security, of the
freehold. The competition certainly isn’t going to
do the Daily Telegraph any good. Possibly (though
the Labor paper is to come out in the mornings,
and not, as was at one time proposed, in the after-
noons) the D.T.’s circulation and other revenue may not
be sadly affected; but the competition will mean
extra expenditure. It is no use the investor comfort-
ing himself with the reflection that in Adelaide the
local Labor paper has notoriously done the Adver-
tiser no harm. The Adelaide Labor paper never
had a decent capital to make a fight. And, any-
how, Adelaide isn’t Sydney. Incidentally, the Tele-
graph is investing in new office premises, too. But
it doesn’t make the mistake of Labor Papers, Ltd. —
after buying its plant and establishing itself it saved
up £225,119 of liquid assets, and that is the nice
little lot with which it faces the contractors,

The Bulletin has been waiting for something to
happen; but the chairman deferred it, and promised
that it should hannen within six months. By the
next meeting the Board will have prepared a scheme
under which the ordinary shares may get a taste of
dividends. This, the chairman remarks, will involve
the payment of 4 p.c. to the pref. shareholders. The
holders of ordinary shares may in that case think
themselves extraordinarily lucky. On the other
band, pref. shareholders will have solid cause to
complain if their maximum 4 p.c. has been with-
held from them until enough capital has been accu-
mulated out of profits to earn a dividend on ordi-
naries. The proper course seems to be (and to have
been all along) to pay prefs. their 4 p.c. as soon
as the profits justified that distribution, allowing
the ordinaries to wait until such further profits were
made as would justify a payment on ordinary shares.
But there is a further point. This pref. capital con-
sists of old deposits converted into capital. The
ordinary capital consists of the money of the old
shareholders. That capital was lost. As at December
31 the balance-sheet says there was still an esti-
mated deficiency of £811,490. The holders of pref.
shares would therefore be very well justified in
asking that the ordinary capital, not being repre-
sented by assets, should be written off. To claim
that £1 of the ordinary capital, which is liable to
be written off, having been lost, should be worth
four or five times more than the pref. capital, is
absurd.
What remains to be done is to make some com-
promise between pref. and ordinary shares. On the
one hand the prefs. have no right to ever get more
than 4 p.c., which means that, except when the money
market is phenomenally easy, these shares will be
at a discount. And it is not good for the shares of a
bank to be at a discount; nor is it good for its
business that it should pay so small a dividend as
4 p.c. on the bulk of its capital. It may be unwise
of depositors and borrowers, who make the money
for a bank, to take any notice of the dividend paid ;
but they do. Small dividends they assume to mean
poor assets, and when they have their choice they
will not turn into a bank with poor assets, and
therein they are wise, no matter whether they be
depositors or borrowers. It will pay the holders of
ordinary shares, then, to make a compromise by
which, on the writing-down of the pref. capital, the
latter shall be entitled to something over 4 o_c. As
said just now, the ordinary shares have no right to
one penny of interest until the capital is _ restored.
The most they can ask is that their capital shall
not be written off to wipe out the acknowledged
deficit. What the exact deficit is nobody knows
except, perhaps, the non-communicative general-
manager Heron and half a dozen others. But it is
certainly big enough to mean that, if the ordinaries
are to wait until the deficit is made good, there
won’t be any dividend for them for many a year
to come. When the bank exploded and made a
rather worse smell than any other at the time of
the big smashes, the rottenest of the securi-
ties were handed over to a Trust to nurse and
realise. The bank guaranteed the capital of this
Trust. For all practical purposes, therefore, the
two are one. This is now frankly admitted by the
inclusion of these two items in the bank’s balance-
sheet: “Deduct [from the bank’s capital) estimated
deficiency in connection with Special Assets Trust
Co., £811,490,” and, on the other side “Contingent
assets, consisting of the remaining assets of old
Bank, the value of which is estimated to be about
£39,000.” Regarding the two, then, as one, we
get this history:—

Thus, in five years the deficit has been reduced by
£276,591, and, allowing for the earnings of the
accumulated profits, it would be approximately 10
years before the hole would be filled up. True, the
deficit may actually be less than £803,800, because,
as this paper has all along said, the management has
been putting surpluses received on sales up its
sleeve. There was nothing wrong in this: after the
new general manager made his valuation, he had a
right, when he got a bit more for a property than
it was valued at, to protect himself by establishing
a contingency fund in case the other properties didn’t
pan out so well. But it has to be noted that, while
these surpluses may by this _ time form a con-
siderable internal reserve, reducing the actual deficit
below £803,800, there are mighty few assets left
from which to get further surpluses. If the capital
is restored in 10 years the ordinary shareholders will
do very well; and, as before affirmed, until that
happens, they are not equitably entitled to a penny
of dividend.
The problem for the management is to so adjust
conflicting interests that (1) prefs. may get more than
4 p.c., which low rate prejudices the business of
the bank; and (2) ordinaries may get a dividend
at once, instead of waiting (sav) 10 years for it.
Ordinaries may argue: “Well, 10 years is not long,
and as, at the expiration of that time, we shall be
entitled to the whole of the surplus profits, we reckon
our shares are worth a very big figure. Our ordinary
capital is only £95,644 (in 191,288 10s. shares),
and even a profit of £66,000 a half-year, such as
we have averaged in the past two years, would pay
nearly 40 p.c. p.a., and still allow £5OOO for re-
serves after paying the prefs. 4 p.c.” That is true:
the profits might in a few years very easily allow
of the ordinaries getting 100 per cent. But will
the prefs. allow the reserves to be starved (thus
reducing their security) in order to feed the ordi-
naries’ fat? There are over 20,000 more pref. than
ordinary shares, and every share, pref. and ordinary
alike, has the same voting power. Also legislation
looks unkindly on over-fat dividends nowadays, and
it would take less than a 25 p.c. div. to incubate a
Bill limiting bank divs. just as gas dividends have
been limited in N. S. Wales. The ordinaries may
thus lose a lot by grasping at too much.
In the settlement of the business there must be a
lot of give and take. Nobody can produce a scheme
and say: “That and only that is the fair thing.”
The ordinaries will certainly get 10 p.c. when divs.
are resumed (if things go right) ; but other good
Australian banks with wise managements—the Wales
and the Commercial of Sydney, for instance —have
evidently made up their minds that dividends of
more than 10 p.c. are impolitic. Some such rdan as
this might be possible. Reduce the £lO pref. shares
to a nominal £4 ss. That would give the manage-
ment £1,217,476, and allow it to wipe out the
deficit and establish reserves of probably £400,000.
With the ordinary capital the total capital would
then be £995,518. on which, on past showing, a
10 p.c. div. could be comfortably paid. Ten p.c. on
£42 10s. (10 shares) would give the present pref.
shareholder £4 ss. a year. His present limit (4
p.c.) cannot allow him to get more than £4; and
he is entitled to the little bit extra for foregoing
his preference, which certainly isn’t worth much.
The ordinaries might get one share for every six,
with the right to pay up another £1 ss. to make
them fully paid. On their £3 (equal to six shares
of 10s.) they would get 10 n.c. straight away; and
the right to pay 255. more, on .which they would
also get in ordinary circumstances 10 p.c., would
be a fair bonus —and they would get a fair bonus,
too, in the fact that there would no longer be pref.
shares ahead of them. With the 255. paid the
capital would be £1,035,369 —well into seven
figures, and quite respectable. A 10 p.c. on that
lot would be easy. The present ordinaries would
have £135,495 of capital, and 10 p.c. on that
would be equal to over 14 p.c. on their present cap-
ital (or, say, 12 p.c., allowing for the extra capital
to be naid up). Perhaps shares of a smaller denomi-
nation than £ 4 ss. might be better ; but that is a
mere matter of detail.

The magician waves his stick and a whopping
deficit is turned into a whopping surplus available
for reserves. It is quite easy. There were four
big concerns in the picture business —Spencer’s,
West’s, Taits’ and J. D. Williams’s. The General
Film Go. took over the businesses of the Taits, West’s
and Spencer’s, and the film businesses of Paths Frhres,
Harrington and Gaumont in Australia. Then, on
the J. D. Williams Co. coming in, two cos. were
formed —-Union Theatres, Ltd., in 300,000 shares, of
which the Williams Co. took 120,000, to exhibit
pictures; and Australasian Films, Ltd., to hire the
pictures out. This latter was in 300,000 shares also,
of which the Williams Co. had 75,000. Total hold-
ing of the co. in the two Combine cos., 195,000. The
J. D. Williams people soon saw the fly in the oint-
ment ; if the other people in the Combine were at
any time nasty, they could put up the price of
films, so that the co. in which the J. D. Williams
people had the biggest interest might make only a
small profit, while the other co. in which the other
people had the biggest interest would make thump-
ing profits. An arrangement was, therefore, made by
which the J-. D. Williams Co. sold one lot and
bought another, thus giving it 97,500 shares ( £1)
in each. But the two Combine cos. didn’t take over
the freehold and leasehold properties, etc., of the
'subsidiary cos. They merely took leases, paying for
them by debentures. In other words, the two Com-
bine cos. began with no assets to speak of, and
the £600,000 of capital is nearly all represented
by that intangible and hypothetical asset, goodwill.
Consequently, the £195,000 of capital which this
co. owns in the Combine cos. is represented by
nothing much that is tangible; and, though the table
alleges that its deficit of £56,577 has been con-
verted into nominal reserves of £40,727, it must be
clearly understood that the position, so far as
tangible assets are concerned, is at most only a few
thousands better than it was 12 months ago—that is,
of course, after paying the current dividend. Fur-
ther, as to the debentures ( £14,000), they mostly
represent the amount paid for nothing but paper —-
to wit, the lease of certain premises. It will be
seen that the table alleges that the assets were
written up £93,939. That, however, is net. The
business was transferred to the Combine for a much
larger sum than that; but the sum in excess of
£93,930 (whatever it was — The Bulletin doesn’t
know) was used to write down other assets.
So far as concerns tangible assets (apart from the
shares in the Combine cos.), this is the position:—

Total .. .. £129,725 £61,798
Liabilities 61,912 41,768
Surplus assets as above . . £67,813 £20,030
That shows a big shrinkage of assets. But it isn’t
startling. First, films and merchandise have been
transferred to the Combine. That accounts for
nearly £40,000. “Book-debts, etc.,” include pay-
ment for goods to arrive; and, no doubt, that part
of the business has also gone to the Combine. Yet
there was this gruesome fact as at December 28,
1912—the co. (capital, £180,506) had solid assets
only £67,813 in excess of liabilities, the balance
being made up of leasehold" t for which large sums
were paid) and improvements thereon (of doubtful
value in some cases), and intangible assets. The
surplus of solid assets is now £20,030, the
balance of the capital and alleged reserves being
made up of interests and investments with two con-
cerns of whose financial workings and position the
public knows nothing, and doubtless will not be per-
mitted to know anything. Those two concerns may
be exceedingly profitable. They run all the picture
theatres of the four big associated cos., and take
the profits from the hiring-out of films; and the
four associated cos. cut up the profits between them.
But what security they offer is quite another
matter. The public doesn’t know, and the public isn’t
likely to know.
Hence the security for principal put into a J. D.
Williams investment is a mystery also. You can see
the £20,030 set out above. The rest you can’t
see; it is hidden behind the Combine’s barriers.
But you can guess what it is likely to be—vast sums
paid (on paper) for leases; vast sums paid (on
paper) for goodwills; stocks of films, and “exclu-
sive rights,” and such-like probably valuable assets,
but not worth much if you found them among the
lumber in an auction room; and possibly a few
thousands in plant and other more or less solid pro-
perty. If one is looking only for profits and doesn’t
bother about security for principal, the whole thing
may be excellent. Enough has come to the J. D.
Williams Co. from the Combine for the past year
(note, by the way, that it is a trifle more than a
year) to pay 5 p.c. and leave a bit over, and the
directors are no doubt quite justified in saying that
the results would have looked much better (1) if the
Combine, having no cash capital to start with, hadn't
been obliged to accumulate some to finance itself, and
2) if the co., instead of including only dividends
actuallv received, had taken credit for its 6hare of
the Combine’s undivided profits up to January 3.
Further, the management is now sane and hard-
headed. and has some ideas about economy. But
here’s the trouble—it is no use backing this co.’s
management, since this co.’s success depends, not on
this co.’s management, but on the management of
the Combine.

Besides the £105,000 mentioned in the last line,
£lB,OOO was provided to pay interest on instal-
ments of new capital; and the £lB,OOO, being reck-
oned as interest paid, is not shown as profit in the
table. This no doubt accounts for the apparently
reduced profit shown during the half-year, inasmuch
as, though interest was paid, it is hardly likely that
much was earned on this new money. The new
capital will be £500,000 with £400,000 of pre-
miums for reserves (20,000 £25 shares issued at
£45), and at the end of the half-year £461,090
was in hand. The liquid assets, compared with those
12 months previously, were larger by this amount
and £133,580 besides; this, supports what was said
just now—that, though new capital came in during
the half-year, and had to be paid for, it was not
practicable to employ it.
The figures, since most of them have to take a
couple of ocean voyages before they reach us, are
old by this time, and great changes have taken place
in the money market since they were nominally
made up. However, the changes wouldn’t affect the
extraordinary strength of the Union’s position. Take
these figures first: —

Thus the bank owed the public £23,228,340, and
its liquid assets amounted to £10,573,084. Of
every £lOO it owed it could pay £45 practically
out of the till. The other £55 is represented by
£7O of advances and premises; and whether they
are worth 20s. in the £ one can perhaps judge from
the single fact that the whole of the bank’s pre-
mises in Australia and Maoriland are in at £388,600
—about the value of the premises in Sydney and
suburbs alone. The rest of the true value represents
an undisclosed reserve —and there are probably more
of such things on the premises at the credit of vari-
ous contingency accounts. There was a time (and
nrobably it is so still) when the chief manager, in
London, had a contingency fund of his own, built
up out of odds and ends of profit that had never-
been disclosed. Everybody was supposed to make-
every provision for contingencies, and there were sup-
posed to be reserves for the purpose; and then the-
chief manager had his little secret stocking in case-
something terrible happened to all the other stock-
ings. Working on those principles, it isn’t aston-
ishing that the bank hasn’t missed a dividend since
its babyhood in 1839. One change, by the way, has-
occurred in the published accounts. For a few years
past they have been signed by an Earl or two and; 1
“A. C. Willis, manager ; C. M. C. Shannon, account-
ant.” Mr. Shannon has now become general manager-
of the Australian Bank of Commerce (Sydney), and;
if he can do as well for the shareholders of that
concern and a little better for the staff, the whole-
congregation will be entitled to stand up and sing
the Doxology.

W. Mofflin & Co., Ltd., was formed late-
in 1911 to acquire an old-established wool, skin and
tallow business carried on in N. S. Wales and'
Queensland. William Mofflin, sen., founded the house-
nearly 40 years ago, and after running it for years,
sold to a private co.—mostly a family affair-
—with a capital of £20,000. From this:
private co. the present co. bought the outfit,
paying £20,000 in shares and £12,500 in.'
cash for the following: Stock (guaranteed), £20,000:
plant, etc., £2742; goodwill, £9758. In the fol-

That looks pretty dreadful for a co. with a capital
of only £40,000. Of course, nothing like it ever-
happened before. “In the whole history of the busi-
ness, extending over 40 years, such a heavy decline-
in prices for furskins has never before been experi-
enced.” But why should that have mattered? Said'
the prospectus: “The business is almost entirely a
commission business, and is conducted solely on a:
cash basis.” Now, was it? The auditor (highly -
reputable old William Clarke) certified that the
profits of the private co. from January 1, 1909, tm
June 30, 1911, were £23,398, after writing £l3oo'
off plant, etc. Certainly it is quite possible for a-
co. with a capital of £20,000 to earn £23,398 net-
in commissions in 2i years; but in that case why
should the old co. want the public to come in, and
why should it sell the goodwill for £9758? An,

The busiest time of the year—when every minute
counts and every machine is called upon for the best
possible service—when breakages mean pounds out of
the pocket of the Plant or Mine Owner—that’s the
time to test “Pioneer” Leather Belting, because it
will once and for all prove to YOU that it is the most
economical and dependable Belt you can put on your
drives. The difference between “Pioneer” Leather
Belting and other kinds is that in building “Pioneer”
we begin with the Raw Leather —selecting flawless
hides and oak-tanning them in our own tannery,
Each succeeding process of manufacture is carried
out by skilled workers along lines which we know
are best. YOUR profits depend so much on the
“always driving and non-slipping” of your Belting,
and so sure are WE that “Pioneer” Leather Belting
will give you best results that we guarantee to re-
place any length that fails through defective
material or make up. We will gladly write you
personally about any Power transmission problems
—we’ve time to do it to-day. “Pioneer” Leather
Belting is made only bv J. C. LUDOWICI & SON, LTD.,
Pioneer Works, 117 York Street, Sydney. Sold
direct and through Agents in all principal Inter-State
Cities.*

Mine managers and engineers contemplating Re-
inforced concrete construction should write for par-
ticulars of the Indented Steel Bar, which gives the
greatest bond, and is the strongest and cheapest re-
inforcement on the market. Used by the N. S.
Wales and Queensland railways for bridges, by the
Sydney Water and Sewerage Board for elevated re-
servoirs, by the N. S. Wales Government Architect,
and by all the leading architects. Should guaranteed
designs be required for concrete structures, our ex-
pert will be pleased to furnish plans and descrip-

For rapid and accurate sizing of samples, the
Hoover Rapid Laboratory Sizer is unsurpassed. An
ordinary hand test over 12 different mesh screens
takes about 10 hours to complete, the Hoover Sizer
will make the same test in about half an hour. By
the use of one of these Sizers the saving in time
would, in a very short while, cover the small initial
cost of the machine. The machine can be dressed
with any series of screens. The Austral Otis Eng.
Co., Ltd., of Melbourne, will be pleased to furnish
particulars.* [4

iunpleasant suspicion is left that, instead of buy l g
anto a reasonably-safe commission business which
was earning nearly £lO,OOO a year, the pubic
bought into a concern which speculated in skins, etc.,
and, striking a couple of good years, made big pro-
mts. Fortunately, the profits lasted another year ;
ithen “the co. bought large stocks, the bottom tell
•out of the market, and the other side of the specula-
stive- business turned up. Or, if it actually was a
‘commission, business before, then its nature has been
•changed. In either case, the fact that the co. was
engaging in speculation should have been made plain
12 months ago; and then, instead of the market-
hoisting dividend of 221 p.c. being paid, a large
sum should have been put by to provide for the con-
tingencies of the business.
Of the capital of £40,000, the amount represented
bv substantial assets as at December 31 was only
£17,509. The balance is made up of accumu-
lated losses on trading, £12,733 ; and goodwill,
£9758. The substantial assets consist almost ex-
clusively of stock (£34,680) and book-debts; and
on the other side there are liabilities totalling
£28,882, exclusive of items in suspense. As for the
goodwill item, the goodwill of any business which
makes most of its profit (or losses) by speculation is
worth very little. In this case, for instance, William
Mofflin, sen., retired from the Board about a year
ago; and though MofHin may have been a successful
speculator in skins and hides and tallow, it does not
at all follow that his successors will be. You can
train men to do a commission business. Speculation
is a different matter —a matter almost entirely of
personal judgment, which a man can’t pass on to his
successors. So far as goodwill consisted of the per-
sonal judgment of the founder of the business and
the man who ran it with apparent success, Mr.
Mofflin’s retirement means that a part of the co.’s
capital is now represented by nothing whatever.
0.T., Ltd., which reports another very
successful half-year, declares an interim div. at the
rate of 10 p.c. p.a. The co., in view of its large con-
sumption of bottles, has bought a bottle-works in
Melbourne. This will be run by the City Class
Bottle Co., Ltd., with the O.T. Co. as the owner of

factory for its cordial and other products in Sydney,
supplementing the one now in operation in Mel-
bourne.

The reserves in this case include depreciation and
contingency funds, and that, of course, means that
the profit includes amounts transferred to those
accounts. Apparently this depreciation fund is the
only provision for wear and tear of plant; and as 20
p.c. p.a. is none too much to write off mill plants,
the true profits are probably at least £ll,OOO less
than the £152,596 mentioned above. Altogether, in
fact, the management, unlike that of most of the
big Broken Hill cos., seems disposed to put every-
thing in the shop-window. For instance, the directors
■quote the general manager that the reserves stand
at 2,000,000 tons. Then: “It can be safely esti-
mated from the highly satisfactory developments at
the 1400 ft. level that a further 1,300,000 tons will
be addded, thus making the estimated total reserves
above the 1400 ft. level 3,300,000 tons.” It is highly
probable that there are 3,300,000 tons above the
1400 ft. level; but no mine of the status of the
North should refer to the ore below the 1250 ft. as
“reserves” or even “estimated reserves.” At the
date of the general manager’s report two diamond-
drill bores had got through the lode, and a third was
in progress. One proved the lode 112 ft. wide; the
other “122 ft. in width, square across the lode.” How'
anyone could be sure it was “square across the lode”
Heaven only knows. A third bore had “just cut the
ore.” If George Weir estimated the reserves on the
strength of two bore-holes and one that had “just cut the
ore,” and did it without suggestion from his direc-
tors, this paper’s opinion of George Weir will have to
be modified. In any case, the whole business leaves
an unpleasant taste, and suggests that the investor
can’t afford to put the North in the same class
as, for instance, the South.
Of course, the North is a great mine; and the
management has done great work. During the half-
year the mill treated 154,829 tons of ore, and £3375
was received on account of slimes sold to the Junc-
tion North; but that amount is not equal to the
value of the slimes produced, which were apparently
stacked, so that it can be safely said that the
154,829 tons produced the £152,’596 mentioned above,
less an allowance for depreciation and contingencies.
That is approximately £1 per ton. But it isn’t safe
to assume that the ore in the mine will average that
much profit. The ore at the bottom level, on such
evidence as the diamond-drill cores offer, is richer
than the stuff lately going through the mill; on the
other hand, the metal markets can’t be expected to
stay where they have been lately. In connection with
B. IT. South it was shown last week that whereas
on last half-year’s figures the profit was 16s. 9d. per
ton, the dividends paid during the past seven years
have averaged only 9s. 6d. per ton; and the North
is open to exactly the same market vicissitudes. On
the same basis, computing the North’s true profit last
half at 18s. 6d. per ton, the former’s divisible profit,
based on the seven years’ experience of the South as
to metal markets, etc., would be 10s. sd. What
quantity of ore we ought to allow the North to have
is quite a matter of opinion. It looks safe to-
assume that there are 3,300,000 tons; for if there
isn’t as much between the 1250 ft. and 1400 ft. levels as
is officially estimated on evidence which The Bulle-
tin can’t regard as satisfactory, there is certainly
some ore—perhaps a great deal of ore —below the
1400 ft. At 10s. sd. per ton 3,300,000 tons would be
worth £1,718,000 to the shareholders; and as there
are 600.000 shares in the co., that 'works out at
£2 17s. per share. That is for the ore which may
reasonably be expected to be in the mine, working
on last year’s recoveries, etc., and seven years’ metal-
market experiences. For the rest, there is £208,460
of liquid assets in excess of liabilities; and that is
another 6s. 9d. per share —a little lot to cover con-
tingencies, etc. The market, curiously enough, values
the North at £2 17s. ; so, for once in a way, there is
no conflict between the market value and the value
worked out on reserves and average profits. But a
man with a weak heart, or one who is likely to want
his money in a hurry within seven years or so, isn’t
advised to buy these or any other metal-mining
shares—except for a speculation ; and with that The
Bulletin has nothing to do. For nothing is surer
than that, though the mine ought to pay the money
mentioned and a bit over for interest, there will be
times when the metals will sag and the market price
will sag with them.
Great Cobar is developing limestone de-
posits near Molong; about 50 men are opening up
the quarries. A loop line will make this limestone
available in large quantities for the Cobar smelter,
and cheaper fluxes will help to reduce smelting costs.
It is a constant struggle to make an average ex-
traction of less than 2 p.c. copper pay with copper
at low prices, for 2 units at £6O a ton are worth
only 245.

Carpathia, Ardlethan, had its half-yearly
meeting in Sydney last week ; but no accounts were
published. The chairman, however, made a speech,
and another Is. div. was declared —the first since Octo-
ber. But the mine has earned little more than Is.
per share in the six months. The profit was said by
the chairman to have been £7071, and a Is. div. takes
£5203, so there wasn’t enough to pay even another
6d. out of the half-year’s .profits. With the shilling
now provided by drawing on past profits, the capital
expenditure has been repaid; and there is a whoop
accordingly. Unfortunately, this only means that
those original few whose shares cost them 4s. apiece
have got their money back. The others who were
drawn into the atrocious Ardlethan boom, and paid
over 305., have a long way to go yet. There is, of
course, not a word about ore reserves, the fact being
that there are none worth mentioning. As in 99
lode-tin mines out of every 100, the bodies are
irregular in size and value; as the old Cornish tin-
miner said, “Where ’tis, there ’tis.” The Carpathia
may go on for years turning out ore in uncertain
quantities; but it will be a gamble all the time.

The show known locally as Breakfast
Creek, or Blackfellow’s Reef, in the Oberon (N.S.W.)
district, has.been under investigation for some time
by a Bendigo crowd, in which the Lansells are said
to be interested. Parcels of ore have been sent to Vic-
toria for treatment, with satisfactory results, and
the making of a large dam has been commenced, and
a 10-head battery is to be erected shortly. The mine
is not far from Wiseman’s Creek, in a large but
poorly prospected metalliferous district, which has
more than a sporting chance of some day producing
something worth while.
* * * *
Mount Boppy, N.S.W.’s most productive
gold mine, shut down for a few weeks past through
want of water, has' got enough out of a monsoonal
shower to start up again. Further out the country
is still dry. Broken Hill has had just under 7in. in
14 months; and still the water co.’s Stephens Creek
reservoir hangs out very well.
* * * *
Though Black Range (W.A.) will never
be fully trusted again, the developments at the
bottom look fairly right. At the date of the mana-
ger’s report put before shareholders in Melbourne
last week the stone met in the shaft 200 ft. below the
bottom (No. 13) level had been driven on 26ft., and
varied from 2ft. 6in. to 3ft., worth at one end lOdwt.
and at the other 30dwt. Nothing has been done on
ore between No. 13 and No. 15, now started; and
how far up the lOdwt. to 30dwt. ore runs towards
the No. 13 level can’t be even guessed. At No. 13
the reef is worth very little, being very poor as well
as broken. Just below where the No. 15 has been
started a bedding plane cuts off the good values; and
beneath that the stuff in the shaft is worth only
4dwt. It is possible that the good values don’t run
up far above this plane. If so, the new lease of life
which the mine has got isn’t much to crow over.
Anyway, it is quite plain that the stone is very dis-
turbed ; so the stock must remain one for the
speculator. On December 31 the co. had, well over
£12,000 liquid in excess of liabilities; and as there
are still fair pickings, the quarterly Is. divs. look
safe for a while. Last half-year’s profit was £8139,
after paying the heavy bill for the main shaft and
other development ( £7322). There are 72,500
shares.
From an Edna May admirer at Weston’s
(W.A.) :—“The outlook is as right as pie. When
the third div. is paid it is estimated there will be
£BOOO in hand in cash and gold in transit.
Profits over working costs for the 12 months begin-
ning January 23 may be estimated at approximately
£85,500. Present cash reserves plus proceeds from
treatment of accumulated slimes should cover the
current outlay on additional plant and development.”
Is this profit actually in sight, and, if not, how
much of it is being taken for granted? One un-
favorable development, and the unloading by holders
behind the scenes, would, in the case of a fettered
stock like this, paralyse the market and knock the
small and weak holder down and out. To make a
stock, like Edna May worth 6d. there ought to be
4d. worth of . divs. staring one in the face, with the
bottom of the mine looking well and strong. Other-
wise such shares should be left to professional specu-
lators.
Wandiligong isn’t worrying much about
the dead-set made against the bucket dredges in the
Bright (Vic.) district. The co. was formed in 1905,
and on a capital of £5400 has paid out £21,510 in
divs. ; but there is only a few weeks’ work left for
one dredge and less than 12 months’ work for the
other, and there is no inducement offering to hunt up
new ground. As at January 31 the co. had a surplus
of £3428 of liquid assets, besides a stock of firewood
and stores —enough to comfortably pay 10s. a share.
As the plant ought to run out the remaining ground
without further expenditure, the monthly shilling
should be pretty well maintained without touching
the cash now in hand.
Things aren’t happy yet at the Cathcart
Central, Ararat (Vic.). Those who go down to the
mine see swelly ground up the lead, and doubt as
to yields down the gutter. There has been a
deepening of the shaft to command the wash to the
south-west. Thus the costs sheet will so bulge that
the chance of further 2s. divs. are remote. A sad
crowd which plunged in at the 50-60 shilling stage
on the tarradiddle that 2s. divs. were in sight for
goodness knows how long ahead now expects nothing
till April, and single shillings thereafter. Ballarat
• and Melbourne jackals sniffed the prey long since,
and now yap contentedly because of the profits
snapped from the victims. The Bulletin all
through hated the payment of 2s. divs., for it knew
that the present dead-end must be reached at no
distant day.
United Hustlers and Redan scrapes honey
out of the pot in the upper levels of its old Ben-
digo mine, The cold-footed crowd prate about the
risk of breaking into the old workings, but yields
tot up and hice dividends are shelled out to help the
field. In the old days in the faulted region the
shallow workings gave rattling yields. The plan
now is to Work into the synclines, as the Dagmar
is doing at the Pyke end, to see if the stone there
carries the precious metal. The fault zone at 500 ft.
is to be brought under command. By that time an
idea will prevail of what’s possible at 1135 ft., whence
a good deal of quartz ought to be easily got now
that connections have been improved.
* * * *
A steady shortening of the shoot of stone
in the old Cassilis (Vic.) mine, with the complex-
ity of the ore and a big machinery bill, has landed
the co. in the shallows. The Cerisa shoot to the
south, only down 400 ft., looks like a permanent
make; but it is a narrow formation, and so doesn’t
stand costly mining. The Watt Government, in hope
of saving the district, has put up £4OOO to help
the co. This induces callpayers to find more to
sink the main shaft and crosscut at 500 ft. to reach
the Cerisa reef at that point. Both jobs mean good
prospecting. A big belt of unexplored country lies
between the Cassilis and the Cerisa shoots, and pay-
able ore goes underfoot at 950 ft. from the main
shaft. #
Things are not going to be made any
easier or safer for the bucket-dredgers of Victoria by
the fact that Bright and other townships are crying
out about want of water. The Ovens flows through
Bright; and though it is a clear stream when the
dredges are having a holiday, the liquid is peasoup
or thereabouts when the banks are being put through
the big churns higher up.
* * * *
In the last sink to 1300 ft. the Lyell
Blocks shaft is going down in conglomerate “as
hard as the hobs of Hell,” Queenstown says. Natur-
ally there was a question asked about the cost at
the meeting last week. For only 89ft. of sinking
and for the driving of a connection to the North
Lyell workings £5691 does look a lot of money.
Still, there isn’t tougher stuff to handle in the
Commonwealth than the jasper rock of the Lyell
field at depth. At 1300 ft. Lyell Blocks will cast
about for the North Lyell shoots on their underlie.
If the co. gets them, as manager Bob Ferguson
promises, critics won’t fuss over Melbourne or London
expenses. They will want to be told the price at
which they can take over Sticht and his smeltery at
Queenstown. Of course, Lyell Blocks office costs are
high; but look at the Board-room fittings, and the
quality of the directors!

In the circular officially reporting to
shareholders the shut-down of the Chillagoe (Q.)
works, the secretary says “the directors have gone
into the matter [of finance] as closely as possible,
and the position at date appears to be a debit of
£7OOO. This does not include debenture interest
due April 1 ( £14,336), nor take into account
£30,000 uncalled capital.” There is some likeli-
hood of the Mulligan coalfield railway (which is
being built by the Government) being ready in
September, and shortly afterwards the Chillagoe
works are expected to start again.

Great Fitzroy (Q.) has decided to close
down. In January costs were £14,102, and the
estimated revenue only £12,492, with electrolytic
copper taken at £66 9s. 3d. The revenue esti-
mate for October was based on copper at £75
10s. 6d., so in this short time there has been a
drop of £9 Is. 3d. per ton. In four months to
January 31 the expenditure was £58,142, and the
estimated revenue £56,692 ; but the loss was really
much heavier than indicated by these figures, because
the slump in copper has reduced the actual revenue
below the estimate. The co.’s face is now turned
wholly to the Laloki mine in Papua.
* * • * *
At Charters Towers Clark’s total pro-
ceeds from 18 tons of stone gave an average of
£l2 14s. Id. per ton. The rich little vein that
gave this return branches off from the main level
into the hanging wall, and crosscutting is in progress
to pick it up ahead of the short section that has
been driven on. At the Perseverance lease, now
being worked by the S.E. Day Dawn, a strike of
lOin. of good stone some 300 ft. from the New Queen
Gross boundary has brought shares along in the
market. Papuans are weak because of a poor clean
up. Redmond’s Brilliant Freehold and Day Dawn
crushed 200 tons for an average of £6 14s. 2d. The
directors hand out a shilling div. on prefs.

“Northerner”: The Bulletin’s remarks
regarding the conclusions arrived at by Pellew Harvey,
a director of Great Cobar, apply also to the new'
Mount Mulligan coal enterprise of the Chillagoe Co.
Before Mulligan gets too'deep in the mire and drags
the gasping Chillagoe with it, it would be well if
the directors sent along a Pellew Harvey to report on
the value of the development work thus far done. I
should be surprised if he reported that there was more
than £6OOO worth to show for the £lO,OOO spent.

A Mareeba (Q.) man reports the sale of
8 tons of ore, showing 94 p.c. molybdenite, at
£462 the ton, an increase since last October of
£2OO per ton. Bananaland is now scratching for this
stuff vigorously. Last year a German expert came
along to give the industry a fillip. He met with little
immediate success, but the jump in price has done it.
Chillagoe and the Star River have been mining it
for some time, and prospectors have now reported
finds at Stanthorpe and Bamford.

The tests regarding the safety of brigalov
timber in Mount Morgan run out this month. But
the results won’t make any difference: the men
don’t want to use the timber, and nowadays the
Mount Morgan management isn’t able to get the

“Machete”: Mention of he Yodda Valley
(Papua) Dredging Co. reminds me that as far back
as 1902 the lower reaches of the Mamba and Gira
rivers (not to be confused with the Gira alluvial
field) were taken up in dredging claims which were
plotted out on contract for the Government by one
McGuire. The Mamba was marked off 40 miles
from the sea to Clark’s Fort. Though both these
rivers are fairly easy of ascent (the Mamba particu-
larly so), the difficulty and expense of getting
dredges on the ground wrecked the enterprise and
one or two others. True, a wire suspension bridge
crosses the river, but its carrying capacity is not
tremendous. The “road” is just a jungle track, and
the dredge will need to be packed in vest-pocket
sizes. Little has been done, by all accounts, to
make the track more like a real road than it was
originally. The same old attenuated nigger trots
to and fro with the same old 351 b. load ; and with
no desire to doubt the bona fides of the Yodda
scheme, it seems to me that the co.’s task of getting
a dredge up will not be a light or cheap one. In
all, the distance from the sea by the present road
from Buna Bay is, as the drunk staggers, about 80
miles. I spent some time straightening out the first
cutting of the line, and speak from experience. Apart
from the other difficulties, such as boggy country,
etc., there is one deep and rapid river to cross (the
Kumusi), and a steep range. They may try the old
route up the Kumusi to Bogi, and thence 40 miles
overland*. The Kumusi is one of the most rapid and
treacherous of Papuan rivers, with bars that even a
light launch cannot cross in a fresh. The road from
Bogi is worse than that from Buna, with the same
obstacles of river and range. Possibly to-day it would
need to be re-made. If the dredge ever gets to the
Yodda, it should do well. Much rich ground was
passed by the ground sluicers because there was
plenty of easier gold, and by reason of the heavy
overburden. Apparently an old drained lake bed, the
Yodda deposit is very deep and only casually tested.
The old-time Papuan digger was particular. Good
gold was no use to him. He wanted it blanky good.

Wallaroo and Moonta (S.A.) lias reached
2640 ft. in Taylor's shaft (Wallaroo). The bald
statement that 3332 tons were smelted in a fortnight
and 300.5 tons of “copper placed to store’’ doesn’t give
one an idea of the average quality of the stuff
hauled; but quantities of 2, 3 and 4 p.c. ore are
known to exist below 2430 ft., and at the end of the
west level there is 4 p.c. stuff in the face for a width
of 3Aft. The winze below the level shows ore of
similar grade. With copper at £6O, 4 p.c. ore is
worth 485., which isn’t too fat considering the great
depth of these mines and the wasteful mill-
concentrating process; but, then, there are only
160,000 shares to support. And, in spite of the
vicissitudes of the copper market, shareholders have
got something every year for the past 10 years. Not
very much sometimes —as little as 24 p.c. p.a. for
three years running—but 43 p.c. in another year. The
face value of the shares is £2.

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, March 2, 1014.
My Dear Arini, —-
“With the customary ceremonial” the State
Legislature will have been opened ere this
meets your eye. The Gov. came down from
SiittOn Forest to-day for the purpose, but he
will make a quick getaway after the event
tO-inorrow in order to be On time with a
Catholic bazaai' at Moss Vale.On Wednesday.
Some Literals might scent a hidden meaning
ih the juxtaposition Of the two Openings.
Flit the outstanding fact is that nO Gov.
worth his screw, will ever show his face for
long in Sydney in March,
Lite GoV.-General recently stayed with the
Ogilvies, of Illparan, Glen limes, with whom
the vice-regal folk have been on friendly
tei-ms; . Some time ago Maud Ogilvie stayed
at Federal Government House, Melbourne,
where she met Lady Masserene, then on
her Ravels. Now Miss Ogilvie is going td
England by the. Demosthenes on March 11,
chaperoned by the Mdddrells, of Braidwood.
Wheh she reaches London, it is confidently
asserted. by those who know that she will
be “iii it.” For the Deiimans will be on
hand to show her around, and Lady Masse-
rene has m-omised to take her to Court (not
police, biit Royal Court). Miss Maud is a
beauty and musical,
The wetness of things iast Saturday
damped down several jaunts which were
afoot. Particularly disappointed were the
cadets who fully anticipated a glorious dav
of arms at Centennial Park under the eagle
eve of. General lan Hamilton—otherwise
“Old Half-Rations.” All Friday evening
our boys in bi'own were behaving like the
English soldiers under Lewis Waller the
night before Agincourt. They Were polish-
ing up numerals, belt, buckles and studs till
the metal gleamed like helio flashes. But
everything was, in schoolboy language,
“mucked up.” The boys didn’t know of
the postponement of the review until mid-
day, and then it was too late to plan other
joys for the day. So they just loafed, a dis-
appointed, sad-faced young army.
Talking, of schoolboys, if you just take
notice a little you will see a change in the
boy of to-day, which causes him to soar
sartorially and socially above the adoles-
cents of the past. Boys now go in seriously
for fashion as soon as tliev get into “long
’uns. The creases of their pants cause
them thought and anxiety. “llow do you
manage to keep the creases in your trou-
sers?’ one boy asked another lad, who told
me the tale with unholy glee, for Lad 11.
is a normal kid who would prefer to live in
a bathing costume always. The questioning
youth then described gravely how he had
trousers stretchers and various other aids
to an elegant appearance, but somehow the
crease was not in his pants for keeps.
Boys are ingrained snobs. This charge
is usually kept as a particularly hard pellet
to hit girls with, but like most feminine
vices, such as gossip, it is only a pale re-
flection of a man’s wickedness. The
boarders at a well-known high-toned school
are very keen on classifying their mates.
If his parents don’t possess a motor-car, a
poor kid is treated with scorn, like Jupiter
looking at a germ. There are only three
boys in that state of destitution in the
school. One of these poverty-stricken lads
begged his mother, when she came to see
him in a taxi, to have the symbols of pub-
licity, and disgrace t ken off, so that the
damning fact of its being a hired vehicle
might not creep out. What would happen
to a mother who arrived to visit her boy per
boot I shudder to think.
The normal boy would weep with rage if
compelled by domestic tyranny to Wear girls’
things, but I know personally a lad of 14
who, when he wants to be very smart, bor-
rows his mother’s best purple silk stockings,
“because they stay up so well,” and they
match his tie. He brushes his hair about 20
times a day till it gleams like Lord Den-
man’s, and wears a monocle like G. Reid.
For the credit of Australian boyhood I
hasten to add that this Admirable Crichton
lives in England now, and he is going to be
a curate. He will be a curate. He says he
wants to. And I don’t see why he shouldn’t
be a curate. He is quite unfitted for
brigandage.
The women’s industries’ section. of the
R.A. Show is going to be much better this
year. So Mr. Somer says. The depressing
fact that Mr. Somer has said this every
year since the memory of man—including
the Oldest Inhabitant, the Early Resident,
the Pioneer, our Esteemed Fellow Towns-
man and the Rude Forefather of the Hamlet
runneth not to the contrary escapes the
optimistic presswoman who wishes to
brighten her ore-Show par. Well, we’ll soon
see. The prehistoric patchwork quilt is down
and out. That is so much to the good. They
never send the article now. The patch-
workers are all too busy learning the tango,
which has penetrated even to the dairy-farm
districts. The girls practise Texas Tommy
at the separators. But nothing so large as
'the patchwork quilt, which had the great
advantage of filling wall space, has come to
take its place, except the oil paintings, and
it takes six paintings to one quilt, in space
rtieasufement.. Any pleasant forecasting of
beautifhi exhibits iit the women’s section is
another example of the triumph of hope over
experience*
Women—frivolohs creatures —are really
caught by the tango tea craze. You see. it
appeals to the leading feminine passions;
namely, learning all about the new fashions
and getting something for nothing. The
half-dollar Cfatrance fee covers a dancing
lesson, also tea anti icd-cfedm, hot to speak
of the fiotvefs thi-own. by the bohris On tile
plank. Some of these houfis (not the HoWet-
throwers), oh Friday at tile Tivoli ted,
walked about with languid grace to display
the newest kind of fur wear fot the coming
fi<™rs of our Antarctic wintef,. When the
blizzard blows across the blimp ice in
(.leorge-stfeet, and when the pedestrian is in
danger of falling down the. crevasses near
ibe (space left here for any bank that wants
to advertise),, then these furs will come jn
really useful. But of course everybody
knows t.bat furs are hot wotii for warmth
—only for show.
Enormous were the Coats displayed by the
fur wearers. The girls did not altogether
live up to their garments. Ah immense
bearskin codt demands a heavy majesty iii
its owner. A giri in furs should never slink,
Unless her furs are otter. There was a set
of squirrel—that grey, depressing fur the
color of an asphalt pavement; also A per-
fectly splendid coat, and mUff to match, of
spotted Australian cat skin. (Some people
call it “native cat,” Us if the average cat
was always an alien.) One mannequin
carried a whole dead fox, head one side, tail
the other, slung in front of her waist as a
muff. The innards of the fox had, of cotitse,
been scooped out to make room foi- her bands.
The daisy of the show whs a ripping set of
black fox. Seen against the crimson bang-
ings of the background, it showed up well
and gave to the girl who wore it an added
brilliancy. She snorted, too, a chic little black
velvet hat. There is nothing dead or
dull about black, fur. because all the
high lights are white. The lingerie displaw
which some folk are shocked at, serves to
prove that better is a full-skirted nightgown
than a slit-skirted gown. A gasp goes
round the audience as mannequins stroll on,
displaying under-garments not ordinarily
visible to- the naked eye. The eye is not
the only undressed portion of the’anatomy,
either.
The swagger lift at Stanway House was
kept busy on Saturday afternoon, hauling up
guests to the British Empire League tea-
party, which hannened in the Women’s Club,
on the seventh floor of that building. The
festival was to have been a garden party at
the McMillan ancestral halls at Waverley,
the doughty knight thereof being president
of the League. Miss Alice Phillips (bon,
treas.), Mr. Eklridge and Mrs. Malcolm
Stephens (hon. secs. ) were there, of course.
The men carried belltoppers to a man, and
the frockcoat of ceremony was seen. Though
by rights the frockcoat is not the correct
morning dress now. Short cut-away tails
have supplanted the full skirts of the frock.
The hostess wore one of those fashionable
skirts that dwindle to vanishing point at
the ankles, with a fishtail train. Her gown
was of black cliarmeuse, trimmed with white
lace and silver embroidery, and she showed
curly feathers in her black hat.
The dolls’ carnival meeting was quite a
surprise on Thursday, by reason of the great
crowd .who assembled to talk doll, and the
great interest shown in the tbeme. Mr.
Clarence Moss explained to the crowded
meeting, presided over by Mrs. Richards in
the Mayoress’s room, that the carnival will
be held in the course of next Spring race
meeting in the Town Hall, and will be in
aid of the Children’s Hospital. Mrs. llux-
table undertook to work up the Leura dis-
tricts. Artist Souter and Captain Nieseigh
also promised to lend a hand to push the
good thing along.
The Lady Edeline Hospital for Infants,
out Vaucluse way, is an entirely new and
original institution for dragging money from
the pockets of the more or less willing pub-
lic- A bridge evening at Mosman was one
of the many devices for coin extracting. A
box of sweets was put up to auction and
must have made the record price for lollies.
It was sold, distributed into small parcels,
and then sold again, until ss. worth of lollies
ran up to the respectable figure of £5. Mrs
11. Rogers, Narbethong, Bradley’s Head-
road, was the party-giver, and £2O was got
together for the Lady Edeline babies.
Sir Gerald Strickland has nominated Guv
Wiudeyer aged 13. the fourth son of Mr.
and Mrs. Richard Windeyer (and grandson
ot the late Judge) to a cadetship in tbe
Royal British Navy. Should the hov pass
the entrance examination, he will leave for
England in July with his mother. Mrs
\\mdeyer will join Mrs. Justice Rich, who
left in the Otranto last week.
~ M £; Bell - C ,, t ? le managing director of
the North Coast Shipping Co., was given a
send-oft last week before leaving on a health
trip, on which he indy also pick up a few
wrinkles regarding the special qualities of
ships built to negotiate bars: Hut seeing
that Australia developed the stump-jumping
plough} it should be able to build the
leaping ship without foreign aid* The
Northern Rivers have done as much Us any-
thing else to worry the manager into requir-
ing a health trip; Every day that a bar-
bound steamer is tied up it means several
hundreds of the harmless, necessary profit
Out of the firm’s pbcket.
“Bob’* Bell arrived at his present position
by way of the Union Co.; which he joined
long years ago as a lad in Maoriland. Mrs.
Bell, who will accompany her husband, was
complimented with a gold bangle.
Detective Ward is an indubitably good
detective, for he has dofie the Sherlock
IlOlmes sthnt in picking out fob his wife One
of the richest widows in this city. Mi - .
;J. J. Macken; Mrs. Wdrd’s former husband;
is well rembmbered ds the owner of Tartan
and other good nags which should have won
the Melbourne Cup, but didn’t, owing to
some other horse running faster. He pos-
sessed a good paternal estate in the Ould
Land, which he left entirely to his widow.
Besides this, the lady is a Foy sister, and a
sharer in the profits of the big Foy business.
Thefe ate eight children. Two are daugh-
ters. One girl; Doon; is studying in Dres-
den ; the other, Marjorie, is going to he mar-
ried Very sdon; Some detectives really know
a godd thing when they see it, and, in recog-
nition of that fact; some of Mr. Ward’s
friends met and give him the usual little
testimonial; with many good wishes. Oil
the other hand, I have known detectives whd
wouldn’t be able to detect a mouse in a meat
pie, and the detective force of New York
failed to discover Mark Twain’s stolen white
elephant.
A letter from Snowy Baker in ’Frisco:
“Mrs. Baker and myself arrived in this fas-
cinating city January SO. As admirers of
feminine beauty and good style, we have not
lacked something to admire here. The
women wear quite beautiful frocks, but are
wearing high necks and hats in the evening.
I suppose this is from the fact that most
people dine in the cafds. This dining-out or
cafd living is quite fine. During your din-
ner pretty girls, suitably attired, dance up
and down the aisles between tables, singing
sweet songs and doing the tango, the latest
craze. One night the Argentine tango is
the most popular, another night the Maurice,
and so on. The Maurice really is holding
San Francisco by the ears at present. If
you don’t tango, you don’t live, and if you
don’t tango—well, the girls don’t wish to
know you. All the cafes are artistically
decorated, and the very best vaudeville per-
formances are going on from 6.30 p.m. to one
or two o’clock in the morning. At one
o’clock in the morning after Sunday night,
San Francisco life is at its highest.”
The spaciousness of Kenilworth Lodge
was much admired at the Adams-Monk
wedding. Mr. Jack Want once lived in
half the house. When Mr. Monk bought the
property he knocked two houses into one.
He also added a ballroom, with a musicians’
gallery. Here the gorgeous array of wed-
ding presents was displayed last Tuesday.
Miss Thelma Reid is alleged to have left
Australia engaged to a young man in Bris-
bane. Only her intimate friends know of the
affair, and they lmve sworn not to reveal
the secret until Miss Reid has left Aus-
tralian waters.
Miss Brace has come back to Sydney, and
has much to say concerning that experiment
in open-air education, Woodford House
School, at IJawkes Bay, Maoriland. Miss
Brace is an admirable woman, who took for
her motto, “What a Chinaman can do a
woman can do” ; and on the strength of that
assumption went on the land up Glen Lines
way, in order to cultivate closely her mother
earth. After a few years she tired of that,
though she distinctly made good with her
woman-run farm, and she and her partner,
Miss Alcock, _ separated. Miss Brace then
went to Maoriland, as aforesaid. She is the
typical outdoor woman, strong and sturdy,
of the short-haired coat-and-skirt variety.
There is something about her redolent of the
English “Shires” and “the huntin’,” don’t-
you-know? She was an ardent follower to
hounds in her girlish days, and the hounds
followed a brownish-reddish animal of no
value, and ahead of the brown animal was
nothing in particular except scenery, and a
good deal of the scenery was mud.
Beaufort Burdekin. son of the late Sydney
Burdekin, has been chosen, according to the
cable, as spare man in the Oxford Eieht.
Beaufort is well known here—a tall, fair,
good-looking citizen. He is in his third year
at Magdalen College.
The press party to Burrinjuck last week-
end included three ladies. Mrs. Harrison, of
the Herald ; Mrs. 11. K. Williams; and Miss
Yarran. Mrs. Donohoe, of Paris, now stay-
ing hereabouts for a few months, did the
trip a few days ahead of the party; then
went on to Albury and to Yanco. The rush
to Burrinjuck and back in a couple of days
is alluring though rather breathless.
Freida Bennett, of Mosman (daughter of
Mr. Alfred Bennett), was one of the pretty
girls appearing in the one-act plays produced
last week at the Repertoty Theatre, Linda
Freshfield was another; and she was fortu-
nate enough to draw a word of applause frorli
the critics. Miss Bennett said the papers were
so tough On the fiferfotmers that she was
glad hot to bfe inentioned even among the
also-rahS, The Theatfe League of N.S,W,
was the society which evoked the comment:
The Otranto took away many notables, in-
cluding the Randal Careys, Just befote the

mony of laying the foundation-stone of the
hew Telegraph office* corner of King and
Ctlstlereagh stfeets, in the presence of
a limited company. Bht the stone 1
layer, who is also managing directof,
promised a bigger function later on, which
cheered up the drooping spirits of the staff,
as none of them were invited to last week’s
event. Mr. and Mrs. Hugh Macneill, of
Edgecliffe, also sailed in the big steamer.

Thg Theo Marks have just got, into their
new home in Wodilahra. It used to belong
to the McCabes. It has been feldborately
done up, and now, with its white walls and
gaily painted shutters, resembles the sort of
Italian villa residence that is most in keep-
ing with the local scenery and, climate. Mrs.
Marks may now be said to have thfe most
artistic home and the most artistic motor-
car in Sydney. The only rival she has as
regards the latter is MrS: Philip Moftfcfh.
Just to shake things up, and put d little
life into the prevailing deadness and funeral
of events, and to paint a radiance on the
social tombstone, the Adams-Monk wedding
was a welcome event at the beginning of
last week. Shrove Tuesday was the happy day
whereon Hypatia—yes, that’s really her
name, and she has a sister called Boadicea —
was veiled for William Charles. Their life
sentence was pronounced by Rev. Wallace
Mort at All Saints’, Woollahra, and the
subsequent revel was held at the beautiful
home of the bride, Kenilworth Lodge,
Woollahra. Mr. and Mrs. D. J. Monk are
Vei-y well-known and poptilai* folk. , Mrs.
Mohk’s Cdnnfection with thfe British Hinijite
Le&gue has done nothing tb, dim her geniality
and kindliness of heart;. Thferfe is an import-
ant aunt attached to the family; Miss Alice
Phillips, who is a trufe. sport and fery
pleasant withal. When the family is reck-
oned Up there are many mote aunts and
uncles, for there were 24 Phillipses,
and if I mistake not they claim collateral
descent from the in the Sydney
Botanical Gardens, the pioneer whose nose
is large enough to throw a grateful shadow
on the warmest day—l mean the original, of
course, not the actual statue. And whether
they also take in the bronze Neptune and
the nymph, and the beaks and anchors of
ships and hang them on the family tree
too, I am unable to say. You’d have to go
to the Mitchell Library to find out.
Miss Alice Phillips and her nieces Hypa-
tia and Boadicea —you can read all about the
latter in early English history where she
was _ caned by the Romans —came into
the limelight last Melbourne Cup time, by
reason of going to the gay capital in their
own car and driving themselves. Nothing
happened except that they arrived. Not
once did any of the ladies need to “get out
and get under.” They reached the Cup in
time, wore their prettiest frocks, which had
been sent by express, and generally enjoyed
themselves. Now Mr. and Mrs.. W. C.
Adams are on board the Otranto, sailing for
Cold England, on their wedding tour. They
have hosts of friends, and the gay, colored
streamers were broken in fareweli by hun-
dreds of those who went to the Quay to speed
them on their way.
Miss Tempe Pigott, of the Little Theatre,
tells an authentic snake yarn, and it never
fails to make its effect in the snake season,
which is now. It happened in church, dur-
ing a long-ago harvest celebration. The
building was filled with greenery, hay,
pumpkins _ and fruit of sorts. Miss Pigott
was kneeling in a front seat when she saw
a little green snake wriggling at her out of
the fodder. She neither screamed nor fainted,
being a Bananalander and used to snakes,
but stood up, greatly to the surprise of other
worshippers, and stood firmly on the snake’s
head, squashing it flat. Tempe has a good
firm tread. It was quite appropriate, for she
felt she was carrying out the saying that the
woman should bruise the serpent’s head.
Yours affectionately,
Cleo.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, March 2, 1914.
My Dear Tarrie, —
At Flemington on Saturday the grand-
stand folk flowed backwards and forwards
in a gaily-colored tide from grandstand to
betting enclosure and lost the usual amount
of money by their pilgrimages. The vice-
regal people and an impressive array of
more or less distinguished deadheads joined
in, and had their heels trodden on in the
friendliest manner. G.-G. Denman, back
again for a spell from camps and air flights,
clasped his race-book fondly and wore his
neat straw hat at a rakish angle. Help
Tommy Curwen livened up his straw with a
red and yellow band that arrested attention
and made bookmakers blush. Help Pollok,
who has been running behind the flying
G.-G., showed how delighted he was to get
back to Flemington by doing a sort of single-
handed tango down the steps of the vice-
regal pen. So far as I could see, nobody
reproved him. Chamberlain Nevill looked
pale and exhausted; he has had a busy time
lately, and there is a new potentate coming
along who will have to be taught the busi-
ness and shown where the goods are kept.
State-Governor Stanley, who has only been
on the premises about 10 minutes, really
should have worn his cocked hat for pur-
poses of identification. People who were
anxious to show that they were loyal to the
core craned their necks continuously on
Saturday, but could not decide which young
man was figurehead of the State. The tire-
less Stanley smile was hidden under a grey
felt hat which was much too large. The
Gentleman Helps had carefully bought them-
selves duplicates, and in addition had
wrapped their feet in fawn spats. The
Denman lady was in her favorite pea-green,
with a big Elizabethan frill blowing about
her neck and big white feathers fluttering
on her hat. Her Ex. has been smiling ever
since the resignation of her husband was
announced. The little Stanley dame looked
modest and sweet Under an unassuming
yellow straw . hat, and the blue sash
round her white muslin waist made her
the appearance of a sugar-sweet heroine
in an English country love story. Miss
Knatchbull-Hugessen inhabited a startling
paddy green cloth dress, and the de-
voted Barttelot pair haunted the Birdcage
together. Help Burnham (our most distin-
guished bridegroom-elect) looked almost
ready for the altar in pale grey. He strode
beside tall Maggie Niall with his head about
three storeys above her purple hat. A small
bridesmaid-elect hurried along with them
like a pilot-boat. A number of professional
bridesmaids (the craft have been very busy
lately) trailed over the lawn together and
aired wedding-cake dresses, while appraising
a group of presentable naval youths from the
visiting warships. Young Hogan, of the
Pioneer, promenaded with the Crisp girl he
captured in holy matrimony down in Hobart.
The bride, who has a real Tasmanian com-
plexion, was gowned in blue. Rupert Clarke
watched Jolly Beggar (his Tatt.’s ticket
horse) hug the rails all the way in the New-
market and get handsomely beaten. While
doing so he tilted his straw hat over his
nose and thereby exposed the small patch
on the back of his head where hair is not.
His lady, looking like a slender blue stalk,
supported a black velvet belltopper like a
factory chimney. Mrs. Connolly saw hubby’s
horse, Sea Prince, just miss winning a race;
but ber glittering breastplate of diamonds
helped her to bear up. Fan Dango Mackay
hovered about Radnor’s stall. She was
dressed in yellow and had a big black velvet
F on her bare chest. If it was a charm it
worked, for Radnor got home safely. Mrs.
Glenloth Peter looked cool in white crepe
de chine, while Mrs. Leslie Stuart was an
impressionist study in blue and purple. _ The
country people were in force. . Falkiners,
McEvoys, Austins and Clarkes jostled good-
naturedly in the Birdcage, and the Millers
and Moffats were not absent. Little Min-
ister Willie Kelly took up a prominent posi-
tion in front of the stand, set fire to a cigar
that was much too large, and gave a fearless
imitation of a man smoking. Not a soul
applauded, but an elderly lady was over-
heard to say that it ought to be stopped.
New Governor Stanley, who, like most
new employees, is feverishly anxious to
please, has been trotting about all the. week
and trying to show how popular and friendly
he can be. The good work was begun on the
way out. He walked the deck and had
morning chats with accredited first-class pas-
sengers, and occasionally hovered like an
angel round the deck chairs of second-class
travellers while he murmured nice things
about Australia. Sometimes the whole
family condescended tremendously, and
made pilgrimages to the third-class, where
they patiently listened to third-class con-
certs and said everything was very nice in-
deed. The Stanley lady, pretty and fragile
as a bit of Dresden, was in a state of col-
lapse when the last photograph of the first
tedious day had been snapped.
The Tango Tea, which was instituted,
launched or unveiled in the seat-encumbered
Opera House, is being given a better social
setting nowanights. The whole of the Paris
Cafe was retained on Saturday night
(“from 11 o’clock on”), when the • gaily-
inclined booked supper seats at half a guinea
each, down both sides of the room. The
tall and graceful Dudlev Hamilton, from the
Opera House, demonstrated steps in the
cleared space until the watchers could stand
it no longer and started to compete with
her. The champagne and tango music com-
bined got into the heads and feet of most
present, and soon the whole of the
dancing space was filled. Ragtime Josephine
Davis, swathed in a black silk scarf, got
most of the partners, while Bonnie Watt
got a round of applause for her version of
the dance. Men were soon begging at her
small, purple, suede shoes for the honor of
gyrating with her. She is a proficient, hay-
ing tangoed extensively in America and in
the country houses of English relations.
Edna Keeley, of the Doone co., had a table
of Americans talking through their noses
and using their mouths exclusively for eat-
ing and drinking. The Jim McEvoys came
along after a theatre party—Mrs. Jim in a
noticeable purple mantle. The affair was
intensely proper—as these affairs go—most
people sitting up straight and waiting for
the other person to commence. One pretty
girl managed to attract the attention of all.
You see her flimsy white evening bodice (one
layer or so of chiffon) would fall off her
shoulders and necessitate hitching up. Need-
less to say, the shoulders were very shapely.
A daring suburban dame at first showed
real tango pegtops when she stepped out,
but later on her agitated husband insisted
on her ginning the edges of the slit together.
One pair of partners had such prominent
noses that they had to omit the face-to-
face steps. A number of naval young men
barged into the careful revel about one in
the morning. They all use. the same brand
of tango—rigid parade backs and movements
spasmodic as salutes. But. bless you. no
girl dreams of complaining when every danc-
ing young man has about nine yearning
Eartners to < choose from. The Paris Cafd,
aving no license, can go on until any hour
it iikes. These half-guinea tango slippers
are to be eaten and danced every Wednes-
day and Saturday. Saturday’s function was
packed, although it was not a big theatre
night. There should be some jolly times
when the shoWs ate booming and everybody
is in towti.
The blooming voting widow McCarthy, of
Wellington, who recently married Mr.
Walter Reid, passed through Melbourne the
other day with her bridegroom. They were
feted by their friends at Menzies’, Mrs. F.
H. Patterson (wife of the auctioneer) tak-
ing the hospitable lead. Mrs. Patterson’s
sister is married to Mr. Reid’s brother, and
F. H. Patterson’s brother is married to
Melba’s sister. Now what relation is the
Voice to ex-widow McCarthy and her thou-
sands? Sister-in-law three or four times
removed ?
Ruby Austin, daughter of the late Edwin
Austin, who reposed in the Upper House
for years, was duly married in All Saints’,
St. Kilda, to Mr; Linsley' (“Pin”) Smith, a
Ballarat metallurgist with many friends.
Dr. Gould and Victor Legge supported him
and looked after bridesmaids Hilda Austin
and Estelle Boyd, both of whom put absurd
scraps of blue tulle on their heads and con-
sidered they had thereby satisfied poor, dear
St. Paul, who couldn’t stand women with
uncovered thatch in church. The bride also
got under a misty blue veil and felt that she
was just a little different from all other
brides, past or present. Of course, Austins
came from every quarter of the compass to
dance at the wedding, which was an evening
function and very suitable for dancing at.
Rupert Clarke drew Jolly Beggar in one
of Tattersall’s sweeps on the Newmarket.
Now what can a man with £40,000 a year
or thereabouts want with a ticket in Tatt.’s?
The country would have burst with indig-
nation if Jolly Beggar had rushed home
first and earned Rupert the big prize.
Gaud Mayoress Hennessy is back from
the Queenscliff surf and busy once more
with her charity plots. On Friday after-
noon she loomed at a Town Hall meeting,
the object of which was to help Max Pirani,
pianist and composer, who wants to get
half a pint of study in Europe. The young
man has talent as well as hair, and Society
is on his side. No less than four nice girls
are attending to the secretarial job. They
are Nettie Caro, Vera Bradford, Biddy Eng-
lish and Nellie Billings. The fact that
George Allen is acting as treasurer amounts
to a guarantee of young man Pirani’s pre-
tensions to future fame, for Allan, of the
music business, has no time to waste on
hopeless propositions. On Friday a plan of
action was mapped out, and things look
quite all right for the young Australian.
The wife of Dr. Longdon, of Buninyong,
which is near Ballarat, has just returned
from the Apple Island with a valuable pair
of girls under her sunshade. They are the
Geelong heiresses Grey (or Gray), and they
were so keen on motoring that the party
left tracks all over Tasmania. Mrs. Long-
don has just retired to the Queenscliff hotel
for a well-earned rest after her spell of
chaperoning.
Mrs. Gilruth, wife of Administrator Gil-
ruth, of the Northern Territory, is at
present in Melbourne trying to buy a year’s
supply of clothes. She finds the shopmen
politely incredulous when she makes a raid
on the “cottons.” “Why, madam,” they
moan, “only autumn things are showing
now —even the cotton sales are oyer.” The
perambulating dukes cannot understand
such a strange phenomenon as a woman
wanting a next summer outfit when fur is
on the counters. The drastic changes in
the fashions make the lady of the Territory
gasp. She says she really feels like Rip
Van Winkle’s grandmother, instead of one
who has merely been absent a few months.
Her healthy looks are a testimonial for
the N.T. climate. She is up at seven every
morning, doing things about the house, and
she plays tennis every day. “But I do
miss my mid-day sleep here,” she complains,
looking out at the baked street that is never
empty. “No, you can’t get white maids up
there. But if you take the lubra gently,
and don’t ask too much, you get something.
Sometimes they clear out for a stretch and
take to the bush; but they always come
back to earn some more clothes.” She likes
the rains which many people consider are
unhealthy. “The big, soft-grey canopy of
clouds is a relief after months of continuous
sunshine, and the nights are very cool.”
She is to make a round of country visits,
beginning with Mrs. Bertie Austin, at Eilyer
station, in the Western District.
Three new girls are to “come out” pres-
ently, and the world, which is already well
supplied with women, is expected to fall
oyer backwards and wave its heels in the
air. The debutante trio consists of Katliie
Austin, daughter of Mrs. Bertie Austin;
her cousin, Miss Moffat, and Miss Millear.
The mothers are making a sort of dress com-
petition of it, and if Society isn’t aston-
ished it will deserve to be kicked.
Geoffrey Stuart, who helps to keep the
cruiser Encounter going, is engaged to Cecily
Innes-Noad. The lucky young man has ac-
quired one of the loveliest girls in Sydney,
but as the leading tango expert he deserved
a special prize. Cecily’s mother belonged
to the Howard Smith shipping family before
she married litterateur and savant Innes-
Noad. ( The Innes-Noad girls are to have a
house in Melbourne for six months, presum-
ably in order that Geoffrey may run along
as often as possible,
Mrs. Phyllis Reggie Power and the Billy
Williams matron have returned from Tas-
mania and rejoined their respective hus-
bands. The men grass-widowed together at
Bungowannah Park, the Albury sheep depot,
while their ladies were away.
A correspondent makes an appeal for jus-
tice : On Thursday, Feb. 26, a number of
bird-lovers got together in the Beasant
Lodge, Centreway, and grew mildly furious
re the torture some feathered Australians
are subjected to. The tortures by thirst
and overcrowding of the necessary sheep
and bullock are periodically written up; but
the captured wild bird, though it is treated
just as badly, rarely gets any publicity. And
publicity is the only thing that can help
the poor brute that' is on the way to the
slaughterman, or the unlucky wild bird that
is bound for a cage. It is saddening to look
into the average bird-shop en a hot day and
see the fluttering things crowded up together ;
but, as several speakers at the Centreway
meeting testified, the little aviators have
their most awful time when they are packed
unmercifully close in cages and railed down
to town and lifelong imprisonment. It
doesn’t seem logical to teach school-children
to know and appreciate the cheery tree-top
Australians whilst allowing the bird-catchers
and sellers to run a sort of private Spanish
Inquisition. Every Australian who loves
the bush (and how few are they who don’t?)
should help to save the little bush singers.
Squatter Cedric Campbell has brought
home his English wife and his sister, and the
new missus is now getting acquainted with
her new relatives at the John Campbells’
house in Toorak, before being whirled on to
her husband’s N.S.W. sheep studio.
Mrs. Geoffrey Syme has achieved a
daughter, and the house where Geoffrey
captured the burglar is rejoicing exceedingly.
From my Adelaide correspondent
There was a gymkhana at the Plympton grounds
on Saturday to celebrate the end of the polo tourna-
ments. The A. J. Murrays were there, with a re-
cently grown-up daughter (their only one, by the
way) and a couple of sons; the C. H. Angases, also
with a son ; the Frank Downers; Mr. and Mrs. A. G.
Fenner; the George Bagots; a sprinkling of Law
Smiths and Jessops; some more of the Murrays—the
Rhine Park section of the family ; and an assorted
collection of Melroses, Gilberts and Croziers. A
woollier crowd you never saw; and in the nature of
things the sheep experts got most of the prizes.
(There is a heap of time to practise riding and so
on while the sheep are out in the paddocks waiting
to be shorn.) Despite the staggering odds against
him, Mr. Cecil Bray, a mere townsman, won the Cigar
and Umbrella Race. I suppose they use umbrellas
more in the city than they do up-country, which
would be a point in favor of Mr. Bray. A feature of
the proceedings was a Whistling Race. The man
tried to whistle a tune, and his lady partner strove
like mad to identify it. Mr. G. Melrose and Miss
Lily Melrose won. He had the subtlety to select their
favorite family hymn, “God Save the King,” and
she recognised it at once—or thereabouts. After the
well-nigh fainting contestants had been refreshed
with tea, Mrs. Wm. Gilbert handed out the prizes,
and the revels ended.
The Aurora arrived at the Semaphore with the
Mawson party aboard at about 3 o’clock on Thursday,
and was met by representatives of the University, who
were on the Conqueror, and members of the Royal
Geographical Society, who were on the jetty. The
heroes were given a reception by the University on
Monday afternoon, at which the Governor-General
said a few well-chosen words. The latter put in
Sunday night with the T. E. Barr Smiths, at Aid-
gate.
On Friday Miss C. Coles, the' second daughter of
the late Speaker of the House of Assembly, died at
the North Adelaide Hospital. She had been ill for
some time, and it was thought that an operation
might do something for her, but for days no hope
had been held out for her recovery.
Thursday’s mailboat removed the F. J. Fishers,
Miss Estelle Bowen, and Dr. and Mrs. Swift. They, by
the way, have let their house on Brougham Place to
the Martens, who are due in a few days.
George Inglis, who died on Thursday, had been
chairman of the State Bank since 1900, and was
one of the last of the original trustees who were
appointed in ’B6. He came to Australia with his
people 59 years ago, and took up land in the South,
where he stayed for some years—in those days the
South was the country. Then he moved to the
Lower North, and mixed up institutes, road boards
and other public affairs with farming..
Stanley, Victoria’s latest Stipendiary King or
Emperor or Doge, or what not, passed through in the
Osterley last week. He was preserved from what I
understand is one of the most dreadful of deaths —
I refer, of course, to starvation —by the Chief Justice,
who stood him lunch at the Adelaide Club. The
C.J.’s wife did the same kindly office for Lady Stan-
ley at the Queen Adelaide Club, a few doors further
down the Terrace. The potentates then viewed
Government House garden, went for a motor drive,
had tea, and fled.
Miss Gouger has handed over to the Public Library
Board her father’s diaries of voyages which he made
to and from Australia in ’36 and ’37 ; also, a letter
which accompanied a presentation given him in recog-
nition of his services to the Province (S.A. was offi-
cially a Province all through the unfederated days—
never a Colony) and a few sketches. You, my dear,
being immersed to the very ear-lobes in historical lore,
will not require to be told that Gouger pere was
S.A.’s first Colonial Secretary.
Mrs. Owen Smyth, who has been for a trip to
England, returned by the Ascanius on Friday.
A Methodist conference is on, and one is liable
to fall over a bevy or troupe of dejected-looking
clerics, with things like black plates on their heads,
at any given street-corner. The element of hilarity
is markedly absent from the business of waging war
on the Devil. Perhaps it is due to the buns which
figure so largely in the commissariat of the Heavenly
legions. The conferencers discover some fresh moral
sore in the body social of Australia every half-hour
or so. You never really know what a gang of thieves
and rakes and gamesters and tipplers you are sur-
rounded by till you visit a Methody Conference. On
second thoughts, it may not be the buns and other
lowering food which makes the Methodists look so
dispirited, but the conviction that the entire com-
munity is booked for Gehenna. That is certainly a
view that makes for gloom.
Yours sincerely,
Johanna.

“iEsculapius”: In ancient Greece they used to
erect temples over natural springs and give to each
a titular diety. We moderns are no less appreciative
of the healthful virtues of a mineral water —only our
methods differ somewhat. For instance, up at the
famous Helidon Spring, the water is secured just as
it bubbles up from the earth, and hermetically sealed
until the process of aeration and bottling is com-
plete. You don’t need a Greek fineness of palate to
appreciate the cool charm of Helidon Spa—it has
the same delicious refreshingness to Billjim as to the
Earl of Hopetoun. As a blender with wines and
spirits, too, it gives just that added snap and
sparkle that counts so much in the sum of pleasant-
ness. You’ll be wise to always make it a practice to
“Figaro”: Read a par. here the other week about
Nature planting the giant stinging nettle in N.Q.,
but close beside it the tree whose leaves serve as . an
antidote to its sting. This provision of Nature is
in no way unique, for, just as she curses us with
indigestion so she blesses us with Helidon Spa.
After dining out you’ll have no next morning head-
ache if you take a bottle of “Helidon” before turning
in—this delicious mineral water is Nature’s gift to
those who have dined not wisely but too well. A single
glass will dissolve the undigested food and at the
same time ensure a perfect night’s rest. Quite apart
from its health aspect, “Helidon” greatly enhances
the flavor of wines and spirits—so truly the way of
wisdom is always to
SPLIT IT WITH
HELIDON.
ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
L I on” : As the lack of timber vegetables
is getting serious, I move that Mr. P. Enterprise be
invited or persuaded or compelled to bear a hand.
If the owner of every bit of land bigger than a build-
ing allotment and less barren than a Liberal session
were obliged to do his share of planting, P.Ei,
without turning a hair, could provide for posterity’s
firewood and fencing-posts, for the larger part of
posterity's armchair and grand piano. Incidentally,
he would greatly improve the appearance of his
demesne and earn the gratitude of aesthetes and cows,
who would then have something better than a barb-
wire fence to shield them from sun and storm. And
if he starts his beneficent labor by. planting creek
and river banks, he’ll save many acres of his choicest
soil from washing down to dirty the ocean and strand
ships.
TRIFLES LIGHT AS AIR.
Fashion news: Some of the latest Parisian frocks
may be held in the palm of the hand.
HUBBY : “Am I to inter that you will go out
attired in a filmy nothing tike this?”
WIFEY: “Of course , George, dear. And don't
you think it silly to get mad over a little
thing like that?"
“Doubter”: I think “Gouger” must be
mistaken i when he asserts that ants will build amongst
copper. I lived on a copper area for years and never
saw an ant. ’That taught me to anply strong copper
water and a little powered azurite to table legs,
safe-tins, etc. It’s the most effective ant demoral-
iser I know. On the other hand, the pests seem very
partial to stream tin, and I have seen nests built half
of clay and half of tin. Incidentally, has any Abo-ite
noticed a small, black ant that builds in the bed of
creeks in the dry season ? A few hours before the first
rain you’ll see him working to save his property
like a Legislative Council when a Socialistic Bill is
signalled by the look-out at the mast-head.
Gil Gunnia” : One of the most useful of
our indigenous plants is the Vitis, or water vine.
1 his grows plentifully on our North Coast (N.S.AA’.)
districts and in the Queensland coastal scrub. I
remember one torrid day outside of Gladstone (Q )
when our supplies of aqua had run out and we could
strike only brackish water. We ran against an
enormous water vine, which was throttling a gum-
tree with its thick lianes. We selected a voung
stem (they are more porous, and the water "oozes
out quickly), cut it right through, and made an
incision about 4ft. higher up so as to admit the
air. It filled a breakfast cup in less than two
minutes, and from that 4ft. stem we took over a
quart of water. The liquid is pleasant to taste, and
cool. West from the coast its equivalent is a variety
of myrtle, which the Binghis call “Kurleah.” I
was travelling by camel from AVinton to Charleville
whh a native boy, when our liquid supplies ran out
about 20 miles from the latter town. Suddenly
Billy silently shuffled off the track for about a chain,
and I saw him digging furiously round a tree. As
1 came up he struck a root and pulled out a length
of about 6ft. He sucked at one end while I cut off
part and filled a flask with fluid, clear and colorless
at first, but becoming brown when exposed to air.
I can recommend it as a good substitute for soda at
a pinch or even at some other occasions and sub-
stances.
“Gouger”: On the decayed Starcke gold-
field, 80 miles north of Cooktown, lives a contented
man. He has no money, has no cares, is in superb
condition, and lives in plenty without working, llis
mansion of bark looks idyllic with its surrounding
of banana trees, which bear luxuriant fruit. Inci-
dentally, banana trees require practically no looking
after once they are planted. Another of the
easiest growing vegetables is sweet “buks,” which
thrive round the establishment in plenty. “Buks”
are spuds. Numerous fowls adorn his landscape,
these are no trouble. Given a slight start, they
produce themselves, and in season shed their fruit
plentifully. Bananas, potatoes and eggs are market-
able commodities to the few miners scattered about.
Thus the contented man is making money, though
against his will. For meat, his gun supplies wild
ducks, bandicoot, wallaby and an occasional porcu-
pine. In lieu of tea he drinks water, though, when
feeling gay, he prepares a fluid which produces a
sensation very much akin to intoxication. This liquor
is prepared by hanging a big bunch of over-ripe
bananas in a bag, from the ceiling, and placing a
kerosene tin underneath. The bananas gradually fer-
ment, and drain through the bag into the tin. AA'ith
sugar and water, this decoction produces a superb
Glad Eye feeling, but too frequent application breeds
rare and radiant fantods.
X.P.D. : I could add to the instances
given by McNorth” (B. 22/l/ , 14) of Binghi’s
everyday cruelties; a few gathered
from Papuan experience, such as crabs
being roasted alive, human captives
having their bones broken to prevent
escape, etc. But I don’t need to go
nearly so far to find atrocities. Just
beyond my garden fence there’s a rail-
way line, along which truckloads of
sheep and cattle are hauled to the Bris-
bane market. Some of these poor brutes
are in the trucks for days without
food or water, and within the past few
weeks the shade temperature has been
as high as 109 deg.! Sometimes there’s
a noise made about the few animals
that fall down with exhaustion and
are trampled to death by their mates,
but nobody seems to bother about
the raging thirst of the thousands of
jumbucks that don’t cheat the hang-
man. Maybe it isn’t practicable to
water stock while they are in the
trucks, but it seems to me there’s
enough profit in the meat industry
to justify the Railway Department
making a regulation that stock shall
not be penned up in trucks more than
(say) two days without a drink and
a spell. Evidence was given at some
inquiry or other in N.S/YV. a month
or a century ago of stock having
been five days in trucks. Add to this
a couple of days for waiting-time at
each end, and you have a drinkless
period that would drive a human
being mad.
“Masarcus”: “Gadsby” (B. 5/2/’l4)
mentions the Gippsland bulloekies who staked their
teams over the poker table. Well, this is my trouble.
Five of us were playing one night last year up in-
well, it’s a dead mining camp north of Kalgoorlie.
One was the local chemist, another owned a motor
garage, the third ran the weekly rag, and the next
man owned a claim. I was the fifth. We started
out on small rises, but as the night advanced, so did
the rises, until about 1 a.m. all limits were hurled
aside and we commenced betting up to the sky.
Before I knew where I was I had become proprietor
of th'e Thunderer —plant, comp., bad debts and all.
And in case I starved as a journalist I found I had
an apothecary’s stock to fall back on. Certainly it
was dead stock —so dead, in fact, that when I
approached the chemist after he had pocketed the
gold lease and the motor garage, and wanted to
effect an exchange, he laughed scornfully, and said
he had been thinking of calling in the undertaker
for some time. He also thanked me for saving him
the expense. Does anyone want to buy a miscellane-
ous assortment of medicine bottles and an old print-
ing press ?. .
THE EXCEPTION.
ADVANCE AGENT: "We
make it a rule to pay
as we go. ”
BUSH BUNG: “ Well ,
here you n"t pay as
you come."
“L’Fou”: Does the modern cow's speciali-
sation in milk production invite tuberculosis? Con-
sider the life she leads. Starting as a casual skim-
milk-fed poddy, most likely her active milking career
commences as a two-year-old. (Maturity is not
reached till four or five years later.) From then, with
(say) a couple of months’ spell before each calving,
shell probably milk until (1) she dies, or (2) be-
comes “worn out,” i.e., unprofitable or diseased.
Few cows are thought worth keeping any time in
idleness, so if she fail to produce the annual calf
and resultant milk she’ll be sent butcherwards. Now,
whatever lowers the general standard of health and
fitness invites, or lowers resistance to, disease. Over-
prolonged lactation, I am convinced, is injurious to
the constitution of mammalia. Still if the milch
cow was always Duchess 14th of Butterfat and was
fed and pampered accordingly she might stand it;
but old Poley’s shiftless, stackless, siloless owner
will often milk her to a living skeleton in a dry
or cold or wet season, and submit her to other
privations in plenty. Even the worst of our dairy
cattle are bred to produce milk far in excess of
natural requirements, and the extent to which an
emaciated cow will put fat in the bucket under un-
favorable conditions is a breeder’s triumph; also it
may be the trait or weakness by which that disease
of malnutrition, tuberculosis, creeps in. I read in
an agricultural journal an interview with a western
district (Vic.) dairyman re the latter’s famous
milker. Said the owner: “I don’t know if she can
keep it up. Her mother was a great milker, but
she only lived eight years, and I’m afraid this one
will just milk herself away the same.” Take a jump
across to the hennery. The White Leghorn has
evolved into a wonderful egg ; making machine, and
is booming as the world’s best. Yet it’s common
poultry gossip that in size and hardiness the breed
has deteriorated. And don’t the fowls that die in
laying competitions mostly die of laying competi-
tions ?
“B. Lugs”: The bank was valued at six-
pence when Hugjgins and Jemson met Roberts.
Roberts was drinking, and Huggins and Jemson
assisted him joyfully. Shortly the hard word was
put to Roberts. “A dollar,” whispered Huggins.
“No! Certainly not!” roared Roberts. Huggins and
Jemson were in the street when they recovered. Rob-
erts was still in the pub. Suddenly Huggins paused
in the midst of a sentence which was not flattering
to Roberts. He dragged .Jemson with him on to a
Paddington tram. From the business-like way he
stopped the tram, got out and made down a side
street, you could see he knew hid ground. He
reached the house at a hand-gallop. “Good-night,”
he said to the lady who answered his knock. “Mrs.
Roberts, I presume?” She admitted it. Huggins
did not delay at the barrier. “Excuse me,” he said,
“for calling at this time of night; but your husband
has had—you’ll forgive me mentioning it—a few
drinks in town, and has been locked up. He asked
me if you would send up a pound to bail him out.”
Mrs. Huggins produced the money straight away.
Things began to get vague after that, and none of
them remember if it was Huggins, Roberts or Jemson
who wanted the bail. Perhaps it was all of them.
“E.D.” : Carpenter is a grazier in Gipps-
land. For some time he had a young fellow named
Peters working for him, a native of the district and
a typical born-and-bred bushy. One day Carpenter
and Peters had a little difference over a broken fence
and some missing sheep, and the argument ended
in an indecisive fight, interrupted in round two by
Mrs. Carpenter, whose fainting fit diverted the issue.
For eight months a sort of feud existed between
Peters and Carpenter, although no further mischief
was done. One night at the end of that time Car-
penter heard a faint knock at his side door, and on
opening it saw Peters standing on the verandah well
back in the shadow. “What do you want here?”
asked Carpenter. “I don’t want anything, but a
bloke’s bin hurt.” “Well?” He’s bin shot by
accident.” “Well?” “I Was wonderin’ if you’d
help him, seein’ there’s no othey house near.” “Gopd
WHAT HE REALLY IF ANTED.
SOMEONE'S VICHM (asking advice in selecting
a present): “ Really, it's hard to know
What to do. But if possible I'd prefer the

Mantle and Millinery Duchess: “Indeed.
Then you'll find the groceries and iron-
mongery departments in the basement. Take
the lift."
God, man ! of course I’ll help him.” “It’s on’y fair
to say he’s a friend of mine.” “What does that
matter? Is he near here?” “Yes, he is right handy.
To tell you gorstruth—it’s me!” Then Peters went
down in a heap. He proved to have been so badly
hurt that it took three months’ hospital to put him
on the track again.

A PRAYER FOR RAIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
. Perth, Tuesday.—The floods in Kimberley, accord-
ing to a telegram from Broome, have been very
severe. The rainfall up to date was the heaviest for
30 years.
Kiama, Tuesday.—At a united service in the Odd-
fellows Hall prayers were offered this morning for
rain. Services were also held at Jamberoo and Ger-
ringong at the same hour.
~Two news items, on the same day.
The Lord relieve our droughtiness, and send us lots
of rain!
In helpless inefficiency we’re asking help again.
We know Who runs the universe—we hate to inter-
fere-1-
But drought is most unfortunate so early in the
year.
Iconoclastic atheists have got the awful nerve
To say we shouldn’t pray for rain, but rather should
conserve
The moisture of the rainy months, that dams we
should prepare—-
Oh! dams be * * *! It’s easier to trust His loving
care!
Where’s Kimberley ? Some savage spot where infidels
abound !
But Jamberoo to Gerringong is God’s own special
ground ;
And so we pray for miracles, in meek humility,
We wouldn’t dream of asking, but, well-water’s
scarce, you see!

YOUR ADVANTAGES.
There are a number of distinct ADVANTAGES TO YOURSELF in buying a Beale Piano in preference to any other,
some of them :
Here are
1. You make a Big Saving in Price, Quality for Quality.
You buy your Beale Piano direct from the factory, without paying profits to any middlemen or agents, and
without paying the 35 per cent. Customs duty.
2. You get a Better=toned Piano. ... * i _i
Beale Pianos have a most harmonious, mellow, delightful tone. They contain the only successful ste
tuning-system ever invented, and by means of this device the tuning-pms are held _ firmly for all time,
confining all sound to the sounding-board , which is the only proper construction. _ This invention makes the
piano more durable, because the iron frame alone bears all the tiemendous strain (neai y tons) o le wo
hundred and sixteen tightly-stretched steel strings. This construction cannot be had m any other pianos.
3. A Better=toned Piano because, also, of the Violin=like Sounding Board.
Only Beale Pianos contain sounding-boards constructed on the same principle as a violin-belly. this
construction, and our secret sounding-board varnish, are responsible for that splendid tone which wins such
favor with singers especially. The Beale tone is sympathetic, sweet, mellow, sonorous and Lasting the
tone of Beale Pianos, beautiful at first, improves with use. This is the sure test of an artistically-
constructed piano.
4. You get a Longer=lasting Piano. . . .. .. , r -n
Beale Pianos are made in the Australian climate, of timber seasoned _ m the Australian climate, so they will
withstand the Australian climate better than pianos which are made in cold, wet countries.
5. Your Beale Piano will have a Better Touch. . . ,
We supply a better “ action ’’—one of the most expensive parts of the instrument—m Beale Pianos than y
find in any other pianos of similar price. We supply the recognised best action in the world in our /0-guinea
Beale Pianos, whereas you must pay mot less than /105 for an imported piano containing the same action-
system. It provides that perfect touch demanded by master-pianists.
6. You gain by the Unique Experience of probably the Greatest Piano Expert in the World.
Associated with the founder of this Company (Mr. O. C. Beale) is Mr. George D. Rose, for many years Technical
Director of Messrs. John Broadwood & Sons, London, now acting exclusively as our Technical Lxpert and
Factory Manager. Mr. Rose is the third generation in his family to devote a lifetime to high-grade piano
making. He has had a unique experience in all branches of the art in the best piano factories of Fnglan ,
Germany, France and America, and is recognised in Europe as probably the greatest expert m tone-
production in the world. He has invented epoch-making improvements m pianos. He was lor over twelve
vears President of the British Piano Makers’ Association.
7. You get a Written Guarantee from us—the MAKERS —for twenty=five years.
No other maker guarantees his pianos for such a lengthy period-ten years is the usual thing. But we know
how Beale Pianos are constructed, and we know they will last longer than any others. In any case, it you
buy an imported piano you will find that the guarantee (if any) thereon will not be of much value to you, as
the maker is in Europe, twelve thousand miles distant from you ; whereas we are here, m Australia, with ah
our interests in Australia, ready to support our guarantee on the spot.
8. Only Beale Pianos have quite Reliable Bass=strings. . ~ .
You know that in all pianos the strings (steel wires) in the bass portion are wound with copper or other wire
to make them heavier, and thus afford the necessary slow vibrations. . In Beale Pianos these steel wires are
six-sided, instead of round, and thus afford a firm grip for the copper winding. Consequently no Beale Piano
ever develops buzzing noises caused by loose binding of the bass-strings. Other Pianos have round steel wirem
the bass, affording no secure grip for the copper. Six-sided steel wire costs more than twice as much as the loun .
9. You get a Piano which is built only of Tested Parts. . .
Every part—every detail—of every Beale Piano is tested and scrupulously examined before it is embodied m
the instrument. The slightest flaw in material or workmanship and the part is entirely rejected.
10 Your Beale Piano is Guaranteed Against Damage in Transit. .
We take the entire risk of damage in delivery of the Beale Piano right up to your door : you take no risk.
If it should be damaged by any mischance, we make it good, or supply another piano of equal quality.
11. In case of Damage while in use, your Beale Piano is Easily Repaired. f
We are the makers of the Beale Pianos, and our factory is here m Australia. Therefore, if any part of your
Beale Piano should get damaged through accident or carelessness we can always supply new parts at low cost,
and the piano is restored as good as new. How could you obtain new parts for a foreign piano ? 1 lie agents
do not carry stocks of spare parts, and they have no factory facilities for making them, either. We can make
or renew any part of any Beale Piano at any time.
If you make a careful study of such advantages as other firms offer you, and compare them with the foregoing, you are sure
to come to the conclusion that you will be getting most benefit by obtaining a Beale Piano. Study what we have sai
think it all over—and you will say that it is just simple common-sense reasoning.

Edison says on account of the increasing cost of
wood all furniture is destined to be of steel. “Since
the steel for a given piece of furniture costs only
one-fifth as much as the wood. Steel furniture is
light, because only a little steel is required and it can
be polished in perfect imitation of mahogany, walnut,
or oak. Babies in the next generation will sit on
steel high chairs and eat from steel tables.”

“Eddyson’s” story of a holiday crime:—
J a : j j es ,°! ™ y acquaintance set out (le-
durine I fhe t l^ ta pn S^ + lndepen^ent Woman > Limited,
curing the last Christmas and New Year holidays
are all over 25, but are making no boast of
they are typistes and things of that sort in the
city, and they have literary proclivities and desoise
man because of his nasty habit of down-treading weak
woman. Their holiday scheme was verv simple Thev
tint n n e pr) t l° betak ® them selves to the wilds, P e t up a
tent and live and breathe and have their beino- in an
knwhlh fennnine community of three. They would
kill their own game, conduct their own affairs ami
provide mutual edification, and be hanged to man'
They were Doll, Amie and Ann. They weni to
Moiwell in a man-managed train the Yob j
them into the hills, the Yob set up their tent and
£> b un or , ded , Va , k ' a ' ,le first aid P in the matter of
rigging up bush bunks, providing drainage and
ater S^ p P ly > and running an out-door cook-
ing apparatus, and instructing the campers in an
elementary cure for snake-bite. Apparently the Yob
did not count. Doll and Amie and Ann lived up to
in th£r ln nr Ple i S f ° r ® ye h ° UrS ’ and were alm ost happy
in their proud consciousness that the world was re-
ceiving an eye-opener and man was unutterably
staggered. Then the Blonde Brute drifted in and
a tre ?’ and hoped he didn’t “intw’ude.”
S®JV* d tbe . tw ° lar SC front teeth so distinctive of an
Lnglish heir, he had a tourist suit, two large pale

drooping yellow moustache and a monocle, and he
DoH °thl s °L h >f f Xf °!', ds ’ of Lexford, Berks. He told
he leanedon the tree and critically in-
spected their preparations for dinner. He said he
was dooeedl sorry to intrude. It must be jolly
embawassin for them, he said, to have “stwangers”
hanging about in this beastly way, what ? But he re-
wi net ß ; l nd to 1? th T aII about his people of Lex-
foid, Berks, and explained what a really good sort
of Johnnie he was when you came to know him
Sporting, and musical, and dancy, and all that sort
yeS ' H f. Was laying at the farm house by
the brook across the dell, he said. He gave them to
understand he was looking Australia over with a view
to purchase Before going he promised to call again,
and cheer them up, that was if they didn’t mind
wb V b n nn a nnH W T ard , ° f a fellah ab ° ut the place,
with no particular bwains and that rot, and no claim
but ln being an English gentleman, what?
? hc t bl r °" de Brute returned that evening, and played
th T on , a one-stringed instrument made of a
cigar-box and a shovel handle. The music might have
been worse if the instrument had been made of a dust-
bm and a back gate, but I doubt it. He also showed
thorns nf 6PS 0f rl t . he T ango. They looked more like
r f f ° rdlnary tangle at 2 a.m., but nobody
minded, Lexford was so fascinating. Then he sat
scbon? ar t ll ’, t6 i ling them what a devil be was at
school. Lexford was profoundly interested in the
Australian girl; he was making a study of her. Gad
“w'n a - S af 4 aid he ’. d blessed well lost his heart to a
wipping Austwalian gell.” Doll was sure she caught
a meaning glint in his monocle when he said this.
Amie was happy in the consciousness that his
sparking eye was on her. So was Ann. In two days
Doll was not speaking to Amie, and Ann was speaking
to neither. But the Blonde Brute did not seem to
be aware of any estrangement. He visited them
SEKft and ’ stra ?F ely enoUKh > ea ch thought he was
visiting her in particular. He had a sort of Oxford
nl I ’F'n v l L h i , , S nT k tha F } V!iS sim P ]y delightful, and
P la “ Iy be had been a bad boy in the opinion of his
8011 . dld n o * kn ow whether she would go
abroad after the marrfage, or persuade George Arthur
to stay in Australia, and put into practice his great
idea of purchasing 300,000 acres and growing par-
? n a , lar ° e T scale - Amie resolved she would
prefer to return to Lexford, Berks., and be an English
country gentlewoman with all the modern improve-
ments. Ann was determined to persuade him to travel,
it he had Aunt Bertha’s money and was certain of
getting Aunt Johanna’s, he could very well afford
to leave the grand parsnip enterprise to commoner
mortals Perhaps the Blonde Brute had been a little
more attentive to Doll than usual; anyhow, there
was trouble in the tent of Independent Woman,
Limited on the fourth night, and Doll bore all the
traces of the fray. She sent for the Yob next morn-
ing, tumbled her belongings into his trap, and re-
turned to town, consoled with the consciousness that
George Arthur loved her alone, and the knowledge
that he had promised to call upon her in South
Yarra in the course of a few days. The remaining
partnership did not survive. Again the Yob was
called in ; but as Amie and Ann positively refused to
travel in company, he was compelled to make two
trips to Morwell. Independent Woman, Limited
was down and out. It was a dismal failure; and
why. Doll and Amie and Ann, who aren’t speaking
and positively never will, have all been fully ap-
prised of the hideous truth. The firm was exploded
by a hideous concoction of the enemy. The deliber-
ate intention of the expedition having come to the
ears of other holiday-makers with a rooted apprecia-
tion of things as they are, a mean, vulgar, low-
comedy plot was concocted to break the firm. George
Arthur Lexford, of the Lexfords of Lexford,
Ilungerford, Berks., Eng., was chosen as the dis-
rupting agency, and George was impersonated by a
large, lean amateur actress with a disproportionate
sense of humor. There is the true gall and wormwood
the Blonde Brute was a woman!
A WORSE DISEASE.
NURSE: “ Have you pyjamas?”
PATIENT: "Wore'n that. It' pendercitis."
“Ginger” : Since the Act for the suppres-
sion of Comboism was passed in N. S. Wales, promis-
ing a “sixer” to the bushwhacker that strained
Black Mary to his hairy chest without the blessing
of Mother Church, many boundary-riders, rabbiters
and cod-hunters in Riverina have taken the dusky
damsel as their legal rib. Let it be said the average
Black Mary is no small potato as a camp cook, and,
despite a penchant for pinching her white lord’s
tobacco, a fair housekeeper. She hangs out the
wash every Monday as regularly as White Mary. At
the Balranald Show the prize for home-made bread
was hung on the exhibit of one Lucy Bell. When
it transpired that she was a station gin the judges
made sounds suggestive of astonishment.
THE MISSING
WITNESS.
“He died on the 5th."
"I say it was the
7th.”
“Pity he's not here
himself. He was a
k nark on dates."
Machete”: The Island barquentine
Lochiel, mentioned by “Celia Lloyd’’ in a recent
Bulletin, had a long run as a blackbirder. The
last I saw of her wag in Townsville, where she had
been bought for a hulk. As far back as 1883 she
dropped into Empress Augusta Bay, in the Solomons,
to find that the recruiting party of her sister black-
birder, the Frederick Wilhelm, had been butchered.
Only Rowe, the Government Agent, got away alive.
He swam out to the covering boat with the top of
his head sliced off. The Lochiel had a shipwrecked
crew on board, and a strong party took the unusual
course of landing and pursuing the heathen into his
mountain fastnesses with satisfactory results—to the
avengers. A curious item was the finding of one of
the whaleboats many hundreds of yards inland and
well up the hillside. What Brown Brother intended
to do with it was not ascertained, owing to pressure
of other business.
* » m
Condamine”: Some time ago I wrote in
these columns anent the optimistic reports of Roberts’s
gas experiments at Dulacca (Q.)> advising people
to wait until the growing season before
building too high hopes on the result.
The growing season for pear is now well
advanced, and, according to “Equah” (B.
15/1/’l4) the pear is sprouting out of
the apparently dead branches. This is
bad, but even if no better results are
obtained the method cannot be written
down a failure. The most effective de-
stroying scheme at present is slashing,
spraying with arsenic, and burning the
pear. No matter how carefully it is
poisoned, some of it will shoot again;
also, there is always a quantity of seed
underneath that would grow if "not fired.
Roberts’s method is almost sure to make
it possible to burn pear without additional
fuel, and as this saves slashing, it is a
big save. For scattered pear Roberts has
a small instrument of the nature of a
barber s spray (he calls it an atomiser)
to distribute the gas in small quanti-
ties. As for ploughing the land to finally get rid of
the vegetable porcupine, as “Equah” suggests, if
The Bulletin would like a nice, even crop of pear
to play with, that is just how to get it.
* * * *
‘Onlooker” tells how the funeral proces-
sion was marshalled:—•
Masterton Maoriland. Somebody has died, in the
pa outside the township. The coffin is on a couple
of chairs outside the meeting-house, waiting for pro-
ceedings to begin. A young Maori, seated alongside
ol it, is playing on a mouth-organ. Can’t pick the
tune and don t fancy there is one ; but whatever it is
it is set to some species of ragtime. Maori women
are seated all round, wailing and moaning. Dogs
ivT r! oze - n ceef ? .the old women company. Governor,
the M. 0., is rushing round giving countless orders,
and perspiring pints. The hearse drives up and
stops alongside the coffin. The mouth-organ player
pulls up in the middle of a bar and greets the
d ™ v er of the cemetery: “You here te plenty o’ time,
eh? Governor, the M.C., rushes up and says: “You
drive over t’ere and stop by te gate. When I
whistle, you drive up here.” The hearse trots to
the gate. A scatter of dogs, pigs and Maori young-
sters, and a horse comes galloping along with a
drayload of Maoris. Governor, spotting them, yells:
Eh? Where te blazes you fellows going? We got
plenty work to do before te funeral.” The musical
Maori resumes his ragtime. Eight or nine dogs
have an argument amid clouds of dust. Governor
completes his general orders, and whistles the driver
of the hearse: “Pring te hearse up.” The hearse
drives up, the procession forms, and all make a
straggling beeline for the cemetery.
* * *
“Sarto”: Ettamogah has one of the best-
known vineyards in N. S. Wales, and that is about
the only visible evidence the place can show in sup-
port of its claim to have any sort of designation of
its own. Ettamogah is not a native word. These
so-called native terms are mostly the early white
man’s interpretation of Black Brother’s efforts to bite
his ear for bacca ’ or something. It was borrowed
from the natives of one of the islands, and means,
above all things, “Comeanaveadrink.” Situated
about seven miles from Albury, the vineyard is on
the main Southern line between Melbourne and Syd-
ney. When the Albury-Sydney line was first opened,
some 30 years ago, Ettamogah was not a scheduled
stopping-place. However, the then drivers and guards
evidently knew the meaning of the word; so it was
the usual thing for the guards to call out “Etta-
mogah” on nearing the vineyard, same as they do
now. Then the train would pull up and all who
were in the “know” would sprint to the cellars, a
quarter-mile or so away, and look upon the wine
when it was red, and white, and striped. In course
of time the trains got so into the habit of stopping
to kill a few snakes that the railway bosses made the
best of a bad job, and Ettamogah duly appeared
among the scheduled stations.
“Ananias Walton” : I read with great in-
terest the remarks of “Nestor” on the “Toll of the
Surf” (B. 29/1/M4), and, like him, I offer a sug-
gestion. He proposes patrol boats as on the conti-
nent of Europe; but my idea is far less expensive,
and in time would be practically self-supporting. Now
that the harbor is full of sharks, a number of the
younger ones should be caught and placed in con-
finement in one of the harbor baths, there to be
tiained to retrieve distressed bathers. Everyone who
lias shot with a good game dog knows how gently
these intelligent animals “mouth” wounded game.
My sharks would be trained to the same delicate
manners. Beginning on politicians and others who
are tough in the hide, they would pass from stage to
stage until they could bring ashore a leading lady
without injuring her reputation. Once trained, bands
of them would patrol the breakers at the various sea-
side resorts. Any ass of either sex going beyond the
danger limit once would be gently returned, but
would thereafter be compelled to wear a distinguish-
ing badge. On offending for the second time, the
shark patrol, after satisfying itself as to identity,
would be permitted to dine on the culprit. Of course
this privilege might be abused now and then, but
this could always be met by the delinquent shark
being struck off the rolls, with no chance of reinstate-
ment until, at any rate, he had worked himself up to
the office of Speaker of the State Legislature.
If the Watt Government had courage
enough to tell Melbourne the truth about it-
self, then, instead of dredging the long,
shallow, narrow channel down Port Phillin
Bay to the Heads, and trying to make a
decent harbor of that which Nature never
intended to be one, it would concentrate its
energies on developing Westernport and im-
proving the rail communication between
that real seaport and the metropolis. West-
ernport is a real seaport. It has an en-
trance three miles wide, with a low-water
depth ranging from 42 to 90 feet. Within
the entrance there is an area of 38 square
miles, with a low-water depth “of from 42
to 100 feet. The deep water comes close to
the shore, a railway already runs thence to
Melbourne, and the wharf is but 40 miles
from the city. Not only the battleship Aus-
tralia, but the largest and heaviest super-
Ilreadnoughts in Britain’s navy—in fact, the
■whole blessed navy itself, also the biggest
ship afloat or devised, to say nothing of a
ship three times as big as the biggest one
yet devised—could enter and lie in that
harbor in peace and safety without the ex-
penditure of £lOO on dredging. Of course,
the commercial interests of Victoria lie on
the Yarra and about Hobson’s Bay, but the
persistent effort to make Melbourne an up-
to-date, adequate port for the big ships
that are coming is merely a kicking against
a brick wall. Unless the trade is kept as
near the metropolis as may be by developing
Westernport, all the dredging of Port Phillip
Bay will not prevent Melbourne becoming a
subsidiary port to Hobart.
«
Rangan” : The worst paid man in Aus-
tralia is the pilot. As this country has gone
in for the policy of turning any old mudhole
into a port, and neglecting the best natural
harbors, he is a' necessity, of much experience
and high qualifications. He is asked to take
hold of any ship in any weather—anything
up to half a million pounds’ worth of
machinery, etc., plus human freight—and
lead it up some of the crookedest and shal-
lowest waterways in the world. The eccen-

SWITHEN'S ROUSEABOUT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Don Conochie was big and red,
And Swithen showed him off with pride:
“And little but his bit of bread,
His drop of drink and simple bed
He asks.” We all with envy eyed
The wonder of the country-side.
For Labor then was scarce at Gunn,
And Don could graft tremendously.
At least, that was the yarn he spun.
He knew all things beneath the sun,
And every twist about a run—
Could shoot, and ride, content to be
In bed at one and up at three.
Alas! Don was the last and least
At one important job, somehow.
That week they sent him (for a feast)
To yard and kill a fatted beast,
And he obeyed. O Lord, the row
When Swithen found he’d hanged the cow!

Sore Throat and Influenza,
THE COMMONEST WINTER COMPLAINTS :
THEIR PREVENTION AND CURE.
When the days are cold and wet in winter, disease
germs have a much greater power over man than
they have in summer. The reason is that chill and
damp lower the vitality and render the body less
liable to withstand the attack of the germs and to
destroy them.
Although Nature has made a wonderful provision
for meeting these germ attacks by delegating to
certain particles of the blood the mission to eat up
these intruders, the warmth and moisture in the
back of the mouth and throat enable the germs to
develop with extraordinary rapidity. Each germ
divides into two in twenty minutes, so that, in the
course of a few hours, a .single germ will have pro-
duced hundreds of thousands.
If the body ic in a good state of health, the germs
are destroyed very soon after being inhaled, so that
they produce no ill-effects.
When, however, the system is below par or
weakened by any cause, the germs easily overcome
the defending forces in the blood, and we get the
particular disease they produce.
It is in this way that sore throat,
influenza, and bad colds arise.
Obviously the only means of cure
and prevention is to destroy the
germs in the mouth and throat.
Of all the methods hitherto de-
vised by Science for producing this
result, nothing can compare with
Wulfing’s Formamint. This is
unanimously admitted by the medical
profession.
Many thousands of doctors, in-
cluding several to crowned heads of
Europe, have written to the pro-
prietors stating that they invariably
use Wulfing’s Formamint for treat-
ing sore throat. The reason is that
nothing destroys the germs so rapidly
and completely.
This was first proved by a famous
scientist, who removed some virulent
germs of diphtheria from the throat
of a patient seriously ill with that
disease, and mixed them with a
solution of Formamint. Within
ten minutes they were all killed. In spite of
this, Formamint is not offered as a cure for
diphtheria, although it will undoubtedly prevent
that dread complaint and other serious germ-
diseases.
The Prevention of Diphtheria.
This fact is vouched for by many sanitary
inspectors. The sanitary inspector of High
Wycombe, England, writes : “ I know of no other
preparation so effectual in preventing infectious
disease as Wulfing’s Formamint. During an out-
break of diphtheria I have frequently given away
Formamint to those who have been in contact with
the disease, and no other cases have been removed
to hospital from the same household.
our ambulance is ordered out for the removal of an
infectious case, Formamint always accompanies
us.”
Many articles have appeared in the medical
papers pointing out Formamint’s supreme excel-
lence in the cure of sore throat. In The Prac-
titioner the Chief Medical Officer of one of the
largest Infectious Diseases’ Hospitals in the world
writes: “ I have never had sore throat myself since
I began to use Wulfing’s Formamint, although I
suffered periodically before.”
A writer in the Lancet states : “ I have had the
best results from the use of Wulfing’s Formamint
Tablets.”

THE GERMS OF INFLUENZA AS CEEN UNDER THE MICROSCOPE.
Experiments made at the Physiological Institute, Berlin, by Dr. Piorkowsku
Fiji. 1 shows the germs allowed to grow freely on
a culture medium comparable to the favourable
breeding ground of our throats. Fis. 2 shows the
remarkable decrease in the number of germs when
the breeding ground had -;en treated _ with the
saliva of a person who had sucked three Formamint
Tablets. Fig. 3 shows the entire destruction of the
germs when the breeding ground had been treated
with the saliva of a person who had sucked five
Formamint Tablets five minutes previously. Tims
the sucking of Wulfiug’s Formamin t prevents germ-
diseases by destroying the germs which cause them.
It should be noted, however, that only Wulfing’s
Formamint produces such results. None of the
many imitations now on the market will do . so.
How valueless they are is shown by a physician,
who writes that he 11 has tried .six substitutes, and
has not found one of them efficacious.”
Remarkable Concensus of Opinion.
The social testimony to Formamint’s value is as
remarkable as the medical. No preparation, with
the single exception of Sanatogen, which is made
by the same firm, has received such distinguished
-testimonials.
The Right Hon. Viscount Massereene and Ferrard
writes: “I have found Wulfing’s Formamint most
effective for the cure of sore throat, which quickly
disappears after using a few tablets.”
The Right lion. Lord Glantawe writes : “ I have
been using Wulfing’s Formamint for sore throat
with most satisfactory results.”
The Right Hon. Lord ICingsale writes: “I and
my family rise quite a number of Wulfings
Formamint Tablets, and find them all you say they
are. I always carry a goodly number in my pocket,
and have recommended them to many friends.
As to their value in influenza, Sir George Alex-
ander writes : “ Formamint Tablets have been m\
constant companions during the wintpr, and I have
founjl them a dangerous enemy to the influenza
fiendi”
Among other distinguished users
of Wulfing’s Formamint may be
mentioned the Right Hon. Arthur
J. Balfour, M.P., Sir Gilbert Parker,
M.P., and scores of other M.P.’s; the
Hon. Mrs. Alfred Lyttelton ; Madame
Adelina Patti; and Lord Justice
Buckley, in addition to many leading
barristers, clergymen, actors and
singers, to all of whom the preserva-
tion of the voice and the avoidance
of sore throat is of the utmost im-
portance.

THE HIGHER LIGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The value of the aeroplane for scouting having
been enlarg'ed upon in Melbourne, some good soul
suggests that aeroplanes, with searchlights, might be
employed in the supervision of our parks and gardens
“in the interests of morality.”
Where lovers on the grateful grass
In sweet abandon scatter,
Will holy airmen as they pass
Throw light upon the matter.
The cherubs these aloft, who keep
An eye upon us lest we sweep —
Condemned by Wowserish suspicion—
A-down the gulf of black perdition.
We see them with the eye of faith
Go flaming o’er the closure;
No kissing miss, no whimp'ring wraith
Can hope to ’scape exposure.
Had they been earlier on the scene,
Salvation sure it would have been—
O’er Eden they’d have cruelled Madam
Eve’s naughty plot to ruin Adam.
The “Light” the Scriptures tell about,
Synonym of felicity,
Is now quite understood ; no doubt
It's modern electricity.
Athwart the world it will be shed
By Wowser airmen overhead.
Then preen your wings, oh, dour ascetic,
“Sky Pilot” was a term prophetic!
VICTORIA.
EDDYSON.
“Wandi” writes: —
A deputation from the Sydney Labor Council
asked, nay implored, the Minister for Industry and
Labor to start Socialistic registry offices. What
with the scarcity of good jobs, the arrogance of the
bloated employer, the rise in the cost of alcohol and
other factors, the registry-office keeper has got above
himself. He is becoming less like an inoffensive
barterer of jobs, on a trifling commission basis, and
more like an Old World buccaneer. It has come
to this now, that unemployed persons have to buy
work, and in many cases buy it at an exorbitant
figure. The current price of billets varies enor-
mously, according to the experts on the deputation.
For a pleasant job at £3 a week a tenner would be
demanded and, mayhap, paid. Hard graft, attached
to irregular hours and rotten pay, can be had at
bargain rates. The character of the boss affects
rates even more than the class of work or its
locality. Very few will invest a dollar in a Wow-
ser, and the same applies to places where the
“missus” takes a hand at bossing the man—or men.
One deputationist stated that he had paid £3 10s.
for a job worth £4 10s. a week—which was con-
sidered a cheap lot; another had paid £1 for a
billet worth £1 a week —and which only ran to one
week. A £2OO a year occupation for a married
couple in the country (without “encumbrances”)
changed hands at £7. Most job-hunters have to
pay a registration fee of ss. before their applications
for a vacancy are so much as considered. And even
then they buy the job in a bag, as it were, since
thev are not informed as to its whereabouts or the
identity of their future employer until the cash is
paid over. They may find, when the price of a score
of beers has fled, never to be recaptured, that the
yearner for hired help is 300 miles away, and that
they have not the means to reach him. In
that case the job is forfeited, and may be sold again
to somebody else. Under this system jobs have been
sold as many as 50 times, to the great joy and
profit of the vendor. Then there is the double
system, which requires the boss to buy his man
("who may not stay when he gets him), besides com-
pelling the man to buy his boss (who may sack him
the day he arrives). All things considered, this
matter of job-trafficking appears to be an excellent
one for the Government to take in hand.
“Suburban Rebel”: There can be no
doubt about the earnestness of these Ulster
lie-and-she-patriots. To a man —and a
woman —they keep on promising, in the most
heroic possible manner, that the other fel-
low will shed the last drop of his blood in
the defence of the blessed half-province—
the other half is strongly Nationalist —
though it has never been clearly explained
what the place is threatened with, and how
the last drop is going to save it. It is a
perfect orgie of national sacrifice.
Everybody appears to be offering up his
relations, friends and creditors, regardless
of expense. Some rash and unreasoning
female who has stitched a flag for the
cohorts of Carson in the stuffy seclusion of
a back parlor is the latest to promise that
a number of other people whom she doesn’t
know to nod to will give their last drops,
dye the battlefield the usual tint, and expire
in a highly spectacular manner. I am
waiting for one of these martyrs-by-deputy
to be contradicted by one of the prospective
corpses, as young Farmburner contradicted
his Jingo old man, the week before con-
tingent sailed for South Africa. Young
Farmburner had been overjoyed when he
was selected ; and he continued to be over-
joyed until he overheard his proud and
wiiiskyfied parent bragging to the man next
door that his boy was going to shed his
blood for the Dear Old Motherland, and “if
I was a younger man, by God,” etc., etc.
The free and hearty manner, in which the
old man continued to shed his (the son’s)
blood for the uplifting of the neighbors at
last affected young Farmburner’s nerve, and
lie tramped on to the dark verandah whin-
ing wretchedly: ,l, Ere! give it a rest, carn’t
yer? Go an’ shed yer own damn blood, if
yer want ter. Leave mine be!” Of course
he was quite right. Every man should have
the disposal of his own blood.
There is a gang in Melbourne known as
the Dandy Dozen, who toil not, neither do
they spin. They are confidence men of the
minor sort and hunters of small game, like
the individual who goes out int“ the wilder-
ness and shoots a bee, and then runs. Cav-
ing ingratiated himself with a too-confiding
damsel in the city, the Dandy trots his prey
off for a talk in Alexandra Gardens, snatches
her purse, and then eats up time and space
in his retreat. Still the Dandy does not have
all the luck. One night recently, a minor
commotion was heard in the vicinity of the
Burns statue on St. Ivilda-road, and early
arrivals witnessed a smart dust-up between
a nice-looking, gentle-looking, neatly-
dressed girl and a gay, clean-shaven youth
who had an expression of deadly fear and
all the signs of having been hit on the mouth
with an umbrella. She was giving him more,
too —with her feet, as a general thing—
while complaining aloud, and demanding the
return of her purse. The Dandy gladly re-
stored the purse, saying it had fallen into his
pocket under a misapprehension. Then he
fled in the darkness, holding his nose. The
purse contained two threepenny bits, a silver
ring and a city tram ticket. Some night a
Dandy will catch that girl when she has one-
and-nine in her purse, and then there’ll be a
justifiable homicide and only eleven
Dandies.
The Irish Parliamentary party has con-
tributed £25 towards a memorial for the
grave of J. G. O’Connor, at Sandgate ceme-
tery, near Newcastle (N.S.W.). This
O’Connor was an old-time printer and jour-
nalist of Sydney, and was chairman of the
first meeting held by John Redmond in the
Scandinavian Hall, where now the Tivoli
stands.
From The Bulletin’s Hired Antiquary:
That Hindu professor who tried to frighten the
U.S. Government by threatening trouble if Hindus
continued to be excluded from America, and
who wound up his diatribe with the words: “Hindus,
as Aryans, are entitled to the same privileges
accorded to other Aryans,” was talking through his
neck. The Aryan invasion of India occurred some
4000 years ago". The newly-arrived whites began by
despising the local niggers. Then they started to
make slaves of them. Later, they intermarried freely
with the “Sudras,” as they called the contemned
savages; and that sort of thing has been going on
for 2500 or 3000 years. It would be impossible now to
find a native of India with a drop of pure, unadul-
terated Aryan blood in his veins. Talking of falla-
cies, there is the question of the antiquity of Indian art
and learning. It is now pretty well certain that
until long after the Greek invasion under Alexander
there was no Indian art worth the name. The great
Buddhist Emperor Asoka imported Greek architects and
sculptors to build and ornament his capital. The
oldest and best statues of Buddha are said by com-
petent judges to be of Grecian origin. There was no
Indian coinage till the Yavani (Greek) kings, haying
been driven out of Bactria by a Mongol invasion,
first established themselves at Cabul, and later in
the plains. A curious proof is that the oldest Hindu
coins have Greek inscriptions even when they were
issued by undoubted Hindu Rajahs. Later, the Greek
alphabet continued to be used on coins, though the
signification of the letters were changed. Inciden-
tally, the greatest Buddhist monarch of India after
Asoka bore the Greek name of Menander. What is
ancient Indian art worth, anyway?
From a man who is trying to do something:
Up here on the Atherton tableland, close to where
Australia will strike trouble some day, there are hun-
dreds of boys to whom the Department does not give
even one lesson a year in the art of Defence. There
are no cadet corps here, and the two rifle clubs seem
to be for the amusement of the men. That my 14-
year-old boy may learn how to defend this country,
he has to ride 14 miles each Sunday and pay Is. for
marker and Is. 6d. for 30 cartridges to shoot out of
an obsolete rifle. Last Sunday four out of the first
seven cartridges blew out of the wrong end, almost
blinding the boy with smoke and dust. The ball on
one occasion dropped 20 yards from the muzzle. Now
to give this boy the chance I spoke of, I pay £2
15s. for a rifle, “send him 14 miles each Sunday, and
pay at least 2s. 6d. a shoot and 10s. to make him a
member of the rifle club —all that he may be the
better able to help protect Australia. All the boys
here would readily become trained defenders if given
the chance which I can give my lad, but which scores
of others cannot afford to give theirs. Why doesn’t
the Defence Department move? Doesn’t it want the
help of men who are growing up in the danger zone?
It seems to me that, with training, their special
knowledge ought to make them of special value.
And, besides, thev are here —and how a lot of those
who are being trained in the South are going to get
here Heaven only knows.
*
The Australian Agricultural Show is a queer
sort of institution —part fair, part circus and
part gambling hell. Without the Ring events
it would burst financially, and without
the introduction of the bookmaking element
most of the Ring events would he limited to
about two competitors. For example, the
trotting “exhibitions.” Everyone knows that
they are really races; and the wagering is
as keen on them as it is on the average
event at the average legitimate meeting. The
patron of a black-blocks show can gamble
on pretty well any old thing if he knows his
way about. At the recent Stanthorpe (Q.)
Show there were 12 “sweat tables” going,
each worked by a gang comprising a croupier
and three or four whisperers skilled in the
art of luring the rustic gamester on to his
undoing. At the same show the “books
were laying and taking the odds .openly
about the wood-chopping contests. And at
most of these annual jamborees there are
opportunities—which opportunities are freely
taken —for betting on most features barring
the championship of the needlework section
or the local oil-painting premiership. There
would be no particular objection to any of
these things were the shows not subsidised
by the different State Governments, with the
ostensible object of inculcating agricultural
lore into the persons who attend them. In
actual practice, by reason of the lines on
which they are run, the bucolics who chiefly
patronise them have no time to absorb any
agricultural, horticultural or other lore of
value. They (the bucolics) are too much
occupied watching circus horses leaping over
fences; trying to pick the winner of the
Trot, and get their money on at a decent
price; or punting at side-show games which
have all the evils of two-up without any of
its extenuating features.
“Petrol” : Have been waiting with some
curiosity the result of the official inquiry
into the burning of the M.L. coasting
steamer Moa. Two small coasters left port
together, the Moa with 2500 cases of benzine
and no passengers, the other with 3000 cases
and a dozen passengers. The Moa caught
fire, and all hands jumped for the first thing
handy, which happened to be the South Paci-
fic Ocean. One man who delayed in order
to take a long breath was blown into the
South Pacific atmosphere. _ The other
steamer lowered a boat and picked up what
was left of the crew. This casualty raises
again the question of the carriage of petro-
leum oils on shipboard. Apparently it is
legal in Maoriland to cram under hatches
unlimited quantities of highly inflammable
spirit. Just what happened to the Moa is
not clear, but a naked light probably came
into contact with the vapor given off from a
leaky tin. The least trivial bit of inatten-
tion’ on anyone’s part may have caused the
explosion. Then, with 2500 cases of benzine
handy, the ship was all blazes and sudden
Sheol from end to end. In N.S.W. passenger
boats are limited to a definite quantity of
combustible oil (too large, most experts
think), and none may be carried under
hatches. Emigrant ships cannot cart oil at
all, but steamers limited to the first-class
passenger trade may stack 500 cases on deck.
Don’t know why a saloon passenger is less
liable to fire benzine, or less liable to be
burnt by it, than a steerage traveller, but
apparently the authorities reckon he
is one or the other or both. There
are several regulations that require
overhauling. The best idea would be to pro-
hibit the conveyance of the stuff, and let
every country grow its own oil or go without.

What especially distinguishes
Odol from all other mouth-cleaning preparations
is its unique antiseptic property.
After the mouth has been rinsed with Odol an
all-pervading influence spreads itself imperceptibly
over the whole of the interior of the mouth,
exerting its power for hours.
It is this lasting effect (which no
other preparation possesses) that gives
to daily users of Odol the absolute
that their mouths are
assurance
permanently protected from processes
of fermentation and decomposition
which, if not guarded against, inevitably
destroy the teeth. ■ -->

POLITICAL
POINTS
The emptiness of all the talk about the
“Greater Melbourne” movement is shown
in the fact that the town council of North-
cote, one of Melb.’s outlying suburbs, is
petitioning the Watt Government to declare
Northcote a “city” within the meaning of
the Act. Every blessed suburb wants to be
a “city,” or the local mayor and council
have strong personal feelings on the matter,
anyhow. And now that Labor men are
getting into -the -councils the -Labor party
feels like supporting the Fat party against
any reasonable scheme for the extermination
of unnecessary “civic dignitaries.”
AN EMBARRASSING ATTACHMENT.
We are prepared to sacrifice everything rather than
submit to a hateful rule. Nothing under Heaven
will divert us from our fixed determination to remain
with you. —A spasm from Carson , M.P.
T HE OLD 'UN: “ ’Eaven! If only he wasn't
quite so affectionate! ”
“A.C.”: “Cavalry under Canvas” makes
an alliterative headline for the S. M.
Herald’s account of the Light Horse camp
at Tirranna. But cavalry, is just what the
Australian light horsemen aren’t. We haven’t
bad any cavalry since the Lajjncers. And
we aren’t going to have any. Heading
novels of the John Strange Winter brand
makes some reporters believe that all sol-
diers on horseback are cavalry.
“Peace with Honor Wanted” was one of
Sydney Telegraph’s big meat strike head-
ings last week. But what the community
really wanted was Beef with Honor. And
at a push it was ready to do without the
Honor.
There was a moral for Peace Society
members, Quakers, conscientious objectors
and that class of animal generally in the
recent escape of a leopard at Brunswick
(Vic.). It, to all intents and purposes, in-
vaded that part of Australia. The invasion
was utterly unexpected. In fact, the odds
against its happening were hundreds to one.
The countryside fell into a state of panic and
complete demoralisation. Then someone —
quite possibly a Quaker —remembered the
Defence Question —that is, he called to
mind the fact that a rifle-shot lived adja-
cent. The latter came along and handed the
leopard three bullets where they couldn’t be
digested. Like the foreign invader, the leo-
pard has no time for talk about universal
brotherhood, international arbitration and so
forth. There is but one argument that ap-
peals overpoweringly to both, and it is in
the habit of emerging from the end of a
gun. j
THE LIFE SENTENCE.
Besides holding-him in two sureties of £100 each
to be of good behavior, Judge Eagleson condemned
the prisoner to teetotalism for life, and cautioned him
that if he drank a glass of beer he would be brought
up and sentenced .to 10 months’ imprisonment.
Harrowing news item from Victoria.
“And 1 direct that you continue taking ONLY
w ater through your neck tilt you be dead.”
If a new name happens to be wanted for
the Australian capital at Canberra it might
be called Gideon’s Fleece. According to the
Book of Judges, chapter 6, verse 40, “It
was dry upon the fleece only, and there was
dew on all the ground.” Gideon would have
made a very good judge of a Federal capital.
“E.D.”: Cook’s cancellation
of the contract with the Wes-
tralian Government for the sup-
ply of railway sleepers is a
shabby trick. Even the Pifime
Minister’s strongest Westralian
supporters, who, being on the
spot, know the facts, admit that
the sleeper supply is in advance
of everything else, and that by
putting on a spurt Premier
Scaddan could still get in ahead
of contract time. All the same,
Scaddan and his clan deserve
more kicks than pity. The
contract was signed early in the
day, in the belief that the line
would be at once pushed ahead.
Instead, of the push there has
been quite a year’s delay, thus
giving the sleeper-getters a
splendid chance to put, the sup-
ply far beyond the demand.
Scadda’n didn’t take the
chance. Instead, he took the usual sleep,
or turned his attention to something else,
so that he fell behind with his contract, even
though he was ahead of requirements, and
Cook had his chance to pull his tail hard.
A habit of wearing his tail hanging down
behind and handy to be pulled is Scaddan’s
mistake.
Some of the Vic. gold-dredging fiends must
have bitten the ear of Drysdale Brown, the
Minister of Mines. The recvnt report of
(he Dredging Inouiry Board was definite
enough as to the need for a prompt rescue
of the most polluted water-courses from the
hands of the syndicates that do £lOO worth
of damage to the country for every six-
pen’orth of profit they make for themselves.
But Brown is not convinced. He is motor-
ing around to the scenes of desolation for
the purpose of presently reporting on the
Board’s report. Meanwhile the dredges are
playing II —11 more than ever.
Even the patience of Federal Justice Hig
gins has given out, and he states that there
may be arbitration or there mav be strike,
but there can’t be both.
“Pink Tape” writes :
D. R. Hall, Attorney-General (N.S.W.) last week
opened a State bakery, and made a few observa-
tions about its cost. Besides being Baker-in-Ordinary
and Attorney-General, Hall is Minister in charge of
the Police Service Board, and he has just sent that
triumvirate a curt instruction that Departmental
Boards, appointed under an Act passed by Wade,
must not grant any more increases, as there is no
monev to pay them. Consequently, the Boards have
all ceased work, and officers who, in some cases, have
been clamoring for months for a grading are denied
the right of as much as the hearing provided for in
the statute. I know, of course, that something had
to be done to hold down the rapacity of the bread
barons, in dealing with public institutions, but there
was a sounder way of doing it than dipping from Cohen
and dodging the sinking fund. There was the Refer-
endum, but the Holman gang didn’t want that.
Besides, old bad habits are not easy to get rid ot.
Neither is Old Henry.
Months ago, recognising that their finances
were drifting to confusion owing to increased
costs, the N.S.W. Railway Commissioners
recommended higher fares on trains and
trams. The Ministry, which alleges that it
is a whale on decentralisation, presently ap-
proved of the railway increases, so far as
country lines are concerned; but the sub-
urban rates are not touched, and the Govern-
ment is hunting around for other means of
raising the wind so as to dodge “any further
burden on the people who patronise the
trams.” Presumably this tender solicitude
for the people who are huddled up in the
city, and the stern decision to make the
people in the country part up like a man and
keep the finances straight, is part of the
Ilolman Government’s bold anti-congestion
policy.
The Northern Territory Royal Commis-
sion has presented its report, and the main
feature thereof is the fact that the Commis-
sion clamors for the completion of the
straight railway line from Port Darwin to
Adelaide. It couldn’t with the slightest
pretence of honesty or decency do otherwise,
for these reasons: (1) The straight line
means a connection with the nearest big capi-
tal —Adelaide. (2) It means supplying the
Empty Province with the shortest possible
connection with Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne
and Hobart—four capitals out of six. (3)
It gives almost as short a line between Syd-
ney and the Territory as the eastern route.
(4) It involves the least amount of railway
building—therefore the least expense and the
least) delay. (5) It puts the Territory in
touch with the places which are most likely
to have defenders to spare when the same
old Territory requires them—the districts
down south. When the Territory is really
threatened the enemy will have possession of
the Northern Seas, wherefore Brisbane and
places up above it on the map will be clamor-
ing for aid rather than offering assistance.
(6) The direct route means a Federal line
to open up the great Federal property from
end to end, whereas the eastern deviation
means a line that will simply cut across a
corner of the Territory, and then proceed to
enrich the Eastern States with Federal
money. (7) Lastly, the straight line is a
device for opening up the high, cool table-
land of Middle Australia, while the eastern
deviation must go down into and through
the great region of remarkable heats and
sudden floods which is marked on the map
as “sea level.” Despite the clamor of cer-
tain Brisbane and Sydney dailies, to have
the costly Federal railroad rushed straight
to their doors, regardless of consequences, it
is difficult to see how the Commission could
have reported otherwise than it did.
THE NE WEST SPORT.
At a meeting of the AYagga Pastures Protection
Board,-. Director Halloran moved that the Board
advertise, fox, the benefit of stock-owners, for the
best-known remedy or preventive for rabbit-eating
by sheep. He said the matter was urgent, as'he had
noticed a large number of sheep suffering from having
eaten rabbits.
Rabbit hunting in Australia with, trained
sheep in lieu of dogs.
It is reported that some members of the
N.S.W. Labor Caucus want the session
lengthened so that there may be time to deal
with industrial matters. But these people
surely can’t be serious. When awards and
agreements are torn up almost every day,
and the Holman Government dare not en-
force industrial laws, and things are settled
by a reversion to the simple old strike
method, industrial legislation looks like a
waste of time.
RINGBARKED.
The Commonwealth Government has started on a
policy ot retrenchment in regard to the Northern
Territory.— News item.
The researches of the inter-State Com-
mission into the operations of the Victorian
Typothetse must make unpleasant reading
for Prime Minister Jocook, and his fellow-
assailants of the preference-to-unionists
principle. The Typothetse members were
prepared, in order to secure preference to
the members of their particular union, to
cut off the supplies of the non-unionists. In
Sydney the master-butchers not only went
in for preference to unionists, but coerced
the members Of their own union who would
not go on strike, and got the carcase butchers
to help them by cutting off supplies. The
British Medical Association uncompromis-
ingly declines to recognise or work with doc-
tors who are not members, even if human life
is endangered thereby. All these things con-
stitute preference of one sort or- another.
In fact, in the present state of society, pre-
ference seines to be ineradicable.
February began badly in N.S.W., but it
was a gladsome month towards the finish.
No less than 196 meteorological stations
reported rain, and as to the few that didn’t
report rain, the chances are that, in some
cases, the wires were down. In the coastal
districts, the tablelands and the Western
slopes, there was wetness at 136 stations.
Of these the worst, bar two, was Cooma, the
place directly south of the Federal capital
at Canberra, from which the waters pour
(more or less! down to ’Berra. Cooma never
has much luck, and its record was less than
one-twelfth of an inch, which looks poor in-
deed, seeing that 41 stations varied from 2in.
to nearly 6in. Queanbeyan, the station
nearest to the Federal capital, had a, shade
over one-eiglith of an inch • and Yass, on the
other side of the Federal city, had exactly
the same. There were only five stations out
of the 136 above referred to (Cooma and
four others) which showed, a worse result
than Yass and Queanbeyan. Out in the dry
West the whole three were badly beaten by
Wanaaring, Ilungerford, Barringun, Enn-
gonia, Goodooga, Angledool, Mogil, Collar-
enebri, Brewarrina, Gongolgon, Byroc-k,
Bourke, Louth, Tilpa, Wilcannia, Cobar,
Nymagee, Mount Hope and even Euabalong.
There is a little triangle of drought-cursed
country on the N.S.W. tableland —the driest
patch within 200 miles of the coast—-and
some fools or scoundrels or anti-Australians
put the Australian capital there.
An old fellow called O’Meara
or something like that was
said sometimes to nod, and simi-
larly the S. M. Herald, when it
isn’t watching itself, occasion-
ally forgets that it is a State-
frighter. In its issue of
20/2/T4 it pointed out that in
U.S.'A. the Federal Govern-
ment main roads with
£1 for £3; and “When shall we
have a Federal Bureau of Pub-
lic Highways?” it asks. If
asks. If anybody , proposed one
there would be 500 leading articles in the
paper howling against “encroachment.”
A meeting was recently held at Broken
Hill (N.S.W.), to consider the advisability
of making every local unionist take and pay
for the local Labor paper. The man who
didn’t pay would of course cease to be a
unionist, and would become a “scab,” and be
cast out and disqualified. The matter was
referred to a ballot. The idea of Compul-
sory paper-buying seems rather rough on the
buyer if he doesn’t happen to think niiich of
the paper, but at any rate it is the sort ot
thing that keeps a party organ afloat.
THE - VICE- REGAL ELDER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
According to a Presbyterian journal Sir R. Munro-
Ferguson was on a recent Sunday ordained as an
elder in Abbotsliall -.Parish Church, Scotland. “We
wonder,” says the paper, “if Scots’ Church will be
looking to add a GoVcrnor-General to its eldership?’
—Age. *
And have Imperial powers at length
Consented 'to inveigle
A fellow of religious strength
To offices vice-regal ?
I long have prayed for such a one
Clothed like the dismal raven—
A Wowser who’ll sedately shun
Official sprees, and take the sun
Apropriately shaven.
I’ve dreamed upon his long, lean lip,
His Presbyterian whiskers,
His way of smiting thigh and ljip
These upper-circle friskers,
I’ve seen him in his -coat of state
(As long as frock dpat pdn go)
Tote round the baize-lined Sabbath plate,
Or rise in pious wrath to slate
Demoralising Tango.
The one I dreamed of ever wore
A very long belltopper,
And books of pray’r he softly bore;
His gait was ever proper.
And, Oh! the man was dour and stern,
And full of prayer and solo,
And never wolild he stoop to learn
Those wicked, wicked words that burn,
Which others use at polo.
And now he comes, the unco’guid,
Ordained an elder lately.
To preach against the semi-nude,
And profit all men greatly.
’Tis well! His thanks the bard indites
To Asquith, who disburses
This boon to comic artist wights
And to the toiling wreteh-who writes
These trenchant topic verses!

PIMPLES AND BLOTCHY,
ALSO BILIOUS HEADACHES DUE TO
SLUGGISH LIVER, BANISHED BY
DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS.
DAPTO LADY’S EXPERIENCE.
Trying to get rid of pimples and blotches
by applying powders or creams is only help-
ing to aggravate the complaint, whereas the
effective way to overcome these painful dis-
figurements is by taking a remedy that will
get at the cause, which is usually a disor-
dered stomach or a sluggish liver. Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills are just the
remedy to put these organs in order, and a
dose or two will invariably be found to give
relief.
“I consider there is no medicine equal to
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills for eradicat-
ing biliousness from the system,” writes
Mrs. N. Allen, greengrocer and fruiterer,
of Bong Bong Street, Dapto, N.S.W. “Those
frequent bilious headaches, pimples and
blotches on the skin and face, so often aris-
ing from bilious disorders and a sluggish
liver, are so easily overcome, as in my case.
Whenever a pimple makes its appearance on
my skin I find one Indian Root Pill will
remove it in a night, clearing and cleansing
the blood in an unmistakable manner that 1
would not be without them in my home. My
husband finds them invaluable for head-
aches. I recommend them to my friends
and feel sure thousands would find imme-
diate relief from bilious headaches if they
would give these pills a trial. You may use
this testimony if desirous for publication.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The brightest sporting item on the bill for
the first day of the V.R.C. Autumn Meeting was
the race for the St. Leger. Everybody regarded it
as a match between Radnor and Andelosia, but
nobody expected a specially brilliant performance
from the winner. Under the circumstances, Radnor’s
runaway victory was amazing. The pace was sound
for the first half-mile, and then Radnor went to the
front and increased his lead until he had won, actu-
ally pulling up eight lengths from Andelosia. The
other four starters battled for third money 10
lengths further in the rear. The time (3min. 2fsec.)
is an easy Leger record for Flemington or Randwick,
with one exception. Amberite long ago won the
A.J.O. Leger in 3min. The next best time
for the classic race on either course is Cadonia’s
3min. 4}sec., which also was scored at Randwick.
Seemingly, Radnor’s recent trip to the West and his
subsequent sojourn in Victoria, under Hickenbotham’s
care, has improved the sturdy son of Earlston. He
ran on Saturday like the real good stayer that Earn-
shaw said he was—in the Spring.
* * * *
The Newmarket Handican. worth more
than £3OOO to the winner this year —will always
be a good betting race and an unsatisfactory spec-
tacle viewed from anywhere near the winning post.
Most of the 35 starters appeared to be charging
down the course in a straight line. The eye of the
onlooker was unable to take in the colors of all of
the leading lot that looked to have a chance. Finally,
the foolishly named lownit was seen to be beating
Cider, with Aleconner close behind. Of all the
others, Brattle was the only one that had conspicu-
ously lost his place after being conspicuously in the
lead. lownit, it seems, was always near the front,
likewise Aleconner and Gold Brew, who finished
fourth, but Cider had been less slick in finding his
legs, and the pace was too hot for him to make up
all his leeway. “Class” asserted itself in the last
furlong of the long-sustained sprint. The runner-
up, Cider, was an A.J.C. Derby winner. Aleconner
captured the Epsom Handicap three months ago.
Gold Brew won the Maribyrnong -Plate up the same
course. And lownit represented the very best of
sprinting form in South Australia. As a 3-year-old
his jecord in sprinting races was four wins, one
second and one third out of eight starts, and he
had been weighted up. to 9st. 91b. With only 7st.
131 b. on his 4-vear-oid back lownit was worth con-
sidering, but there was a doubt as to whether the
son of Grafton could last out the trying “straight
six,” seeing that he had been badly beaten in every
attempt to go more than seven furlongs. A New-
market Handicap winner needs to be something more
than a brilliant squib. He must be good for a
mile on a circular course. It was not yet proved
that lownit could go a mile.
* * * *
The Sydney youngster Woorak made
amends for his disappointing run at Caulfield the
other week by winning the Sires Produce Stakes from
end to end. Up to then the local cognoscenti had
remained firm believers in Traquette, the flying filly
of three months ago. Traquette now appears too
big to be true. The filly has outgrown her strength,
probably, and half-brother Woorak is much the better
juvenile at present.
* * * *
Eight horses weighed out for the w.f.a.
Essendon Stakes (12 furlongs), and the “books”
offered “20 to 1 bar three” before the barrier rose.
When Wallalo, an ex-hurdler, came with a fast run
and beat the favored three, it seemed that w.f.a
“form” must be very poor just now. Cider was
excused on the assumption that his effort in the
Newmarket had taken all the ginger out of him, but
the spiritless finish of Sea Prince (an even-money
chance) after he had shaken off Audacity was a
caution to punters. The English horse showed no
Oash. and jockey Killorn seemed afraid to move lest
the brute might stop altogether.

V.R.C. Newmarket is another sad example of the
evil effects of centralisation. In sport as in every-
thing else, Sydney and Melbourne are Australia. Out-
side those cities nothing counts, nothing happens,
nobody lives. lownit is a N.S.W. bred nag, but
when he was bought for Adelaide he ceased to be a
horse, and became a jim-jam. Nothing he did in
Adelaide was ever commented on outside of Adelaide.
In 1912 he won the Beaumont Trial and Sturt Handi-
cap (both seven furlongs) ; Plvmptom Handicap (six
furlongs) ; the Christmas Handicap (61 furlongs) ;
Norwood 11 aridi cap (also six furlongs). The races
he lost were Tatt.’s Guineas (one mile), wherein he
ran-fifth; The Kennels (six furlongs), in which he
was second ; Port Adelaide Cup (one mile), fifth;
Goodwood Handicap (six furlongs), third; City Han-
dicap (seven, furlongs), unplaced; Rose Park Handi-
cap (five furlongs), unplaced; and Tatt.’s Cup
miles), ninth in a field of 12. Summed-up: He
started in nine sprint events and won five of them.
Had he done the same trick in Sydney or Melbourne
he would have started an odds-on-favorite for the
six-furlongs Newmarket.

At the W.A.T.C. meeting at Perth on
Saturday the 10s. tote passed out a few handsome
divs.: £7 Is., £lO 175., and £5 10s. —equal to 14
to one, 21J to one, and 11 to one. In Brisbane
the winner of the Trial Handicap paid £l4 4s. for
each sovereign invested on him. If these odds were
laid by a bookmaker we should know that there were
hardly anv backers and very little cash involved.
With the Tote it means that the big majority backed
something else, but the solemn fact that remains is
well worth considering. No matter how much was
invested on losing horses the whole sum, less .11 per
cent., went back to different members of the public ;
whereas, under the regime of Judas McPhilistine, the
vast mass of the money invested on losers would have
stayed in the bags of the small ring of bookmakers.
The Onkaparinga (S.A.) Racing Club has
sent its secretary, Alfred von Doussa, round examin-
itip- the steeplechase tracks of other States. The chief
immediate result is that the well-known stone wall
is to be removed before Easter Monday, a brush fence
on the Randwick model taking its place.
“Cog”: One of the many cherished delu-
sions of the horse reporter is that the V.R.C. is as
old as the Melbourne Cup—that the V.R C. inaugur-
ated the Melbourne Cup, in fact. When the 50th
Melbourne Cun was run in 1910 the occasion was
unanimously referred to bv those turf authorities as
the “V.R.C. Jubilee.” In 1911, some of them called
the big two-miler of that year the “Jubilee Cup,”
and also headlined their reports “V.R.C. Jubilee
Meeting.” The fact that 1911 was 50 years after
the first Melbourne Cup had been run was to them
proof that a double jubileee was happening! Shortly
before last Melbourne Cup a ponderous Cup supple-
ment, printed in Sydney, whooped joyfully at the
difference between the £2OO “given by the V.R.C.
to the first Melbourne Cup” and the 8000sovs. of
1913. The V.R.C. didn’t give a bean to the first Mel-
bourne Cup, nor to the second, nor yet to the third,
for the excellent reason that the V.R.C. wasn’t in
existence when the first three Cups were run. In
1861 the Victoria Turf Club (the Victorian pioneer)
ran the first Melbourne Cup. Early in 1864 the
V.T.C. and also the Victorian Jockey Club vanished
off the earth, and in March, 1864, arose the V.R.C.
All of which means that the current meeting at Flem-
ington marks an important and picturesque milestone
in our turf’s tangled story, viz., the actual jubilee of
the V.R.C.
It is a sign of the times that the Aus-
tralian dailies are having cabled to them now the
‘ progress of the fight for the English Cup (Soccer
football), and even the week-to-week score in the
League championship. To the class from which
immigrants are mostly drawn these things are among
the dearest interests in life, and to get unexpected
news of them thus must be like a letter from Mother.
The League is a self-governing body composed of the
20 strongest professional clubs, with home-and-home
matches (38 for each, obviously). The two at the
bottom of the list each year go down into the second
division, consisting of 20 more clubs, whose top two
going into the first. The competition is merciless, the
fittest survive, and the high level is kept up. The
Cup is a sporting affair run by the Association, which
governs the whole game, and to which the League
gives a careless allegiance. Every club in the count-
try enters for it, just for the fun of the thing. One
defeat means out of it, and the numbers come down
rapidly. The saving of the Crystal Palace for the
people—another thing just cabled —has been much
helped by the fact that nowhere else, so far, has
been found a ground giving a decent view of the
game to the 120,000 people who want to see the
Cup Final at the end of April. You can book a
seat for that match, and pay 10 bob for it, too, as if
it were a theatre.
THE NEW STRUT.
Now that airships are abroad lovely woman
will develop the elongated neck walk , so that she
may keep a dignified look-out for flying cats.
The breaking of the drought on Friday
and Saturday last played ancient Henry with Syd-
ney’s sporting events. There was no cricket in the
First Grade, and as it was the second day of the
10th round and the matches had to finish, they
were all drawn games. A weird business, but which
left all the clubs as they were —which was rough on
the batsmen who had done mighty deeds the first
day. However, the Australians in Maoriland had a
good time, having collared the Canterbury bowling
at Christchurch and slogged 651 runs for the loss of
nine wickets. Had the news come on Saturday it
would have lit up the gloomy afternoon.
* * * *
The fact that summer is dead and autumn
is here was brought home by the announcement last
Monday that on next Monday the N.S.W. Rugby
League will commence the issue of the season tickets.
Preference is to be given to last year’s holders, and
the tickets (which include one for a lady) are a
sovereign each, and entitle the owner to admission to
the grandstand at all and any of the matches. It’s
a cheap pound’s worth for those who like football.

London Sphere (24/1/T4) records the
sale of a baseball player in Chicago for 25,000d01.
—say, 5000 guineas—far more than any footballer
has ever fetched on the less fanatical side of the
Atlantic. The Sphere, apropos of nothing, “wonders
what the Australians would give for Barnes.” The
Australians wouldn’t give anything for Barnes.
* * * *
Victor Trumper had a picnic in Maori-
land, scoring 92 against Wanganui and 293 against
Canterbury in successive biffs. Trumper in form is
something the Maorilanders will appreciate, even if
the slaughtered bowlers are their own.
Sydney Inter-club Lawn Tennis threatens
to explode during the coming cold spell. Altogether
81 teams have entered —12 in the A division, 60 in
the B (spread into five sections), and 19 in the C
grade, for the season’s turmoil. The swollen entry
is causing the Association sleepless nights. It
doesn’t know where it is going to find playing accom-
modation.

There are signs and portents that lacrosse
will cut considerable ice in N S.W. this winter.
Bananaland and Tasmania, of all places, will send
along armies with sticks and onion-nets, and there
is a possibility of a triangular dhel between the Uni-
versities of Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. Ma
will also send a contingent to Maoriland in August.
After all, the visit of the Yankee Athletic
team was not a boon and a blessing, and, besides
losing sundry championships, the N.S.W. Amateur
Athletic Association finds itself on the wrong side
of the financial fence. So much so, in fact, that
it has notified the Olympic Fund Committee m Syd-
ney that the proposed athletic carnival had better be
quietly dropped overboard, because as a draw-card an
amateur athletic gathering seems to have but little
effect on the public pocket.
* * * *
The Australian bowlers struck quite a
reef of snags in Maoriland. Of 14 matches the wan-
derers won only four, and one ended in a tie. In
the other nine various kinds of slaughter were handed
out. To get down to sordid figures, Maoriland scored
2212 points to Austraila’s 1995 —a surplus of 217.
But the hospitality made up for everything.
* * * *
Maoriland is enthusing over cyclist G. V.
Tozer, who at Timaru (Canterbury) recently re-
duced the paced records for one mile to lmin. 30see.,
and then chipped the three-miles figures to 3min.
Although they are only local records and still
behind Australasia’s best, they are good considering
the sort of track they were established on. Tozer
evidently has more in him than his dinner.
Another limb of the Paddon family covered
himself with glory at the Woodburn (N.S.W.)
regatta last week, when George of the clan easily
won the championship of the Northern Rivers and a
goblet. This young brother of the burly “Jim” is
credited with being much more promising than the
Australian champion.
Saturday in Sydney was a day of cloud-
covered sky with the faintest of weary north-east
breezes. The Prince Alfred Yacht Club ran two ocean
races, for A and B class yachts, from Fort Denison
to a mark five miles to windward of South Reef and
back. There were onlv three yachts in the A divi-
sion—Rawhiti, Culwulla 111. and Sayonara. Cul-
wulla was 61sec. late getting away, and they went
off on a strong ebb tide with topsails set. But
Culwulla soon overtook and passed Sayonara, which
immediately blew out a jib topsail. By the time
the open sea was reached Culwulla was leading, with
Rawhiti and Sayonara behind in that order. The
wind was deadly sick. Frequently it fell down dead
and took its whole lOsec. on the floor. The yachts
had to tack several times to clear North Head. Off
Bluefish, Rawhiti caught Culwulla. Sayonara was
hopelessly out of it, and finally dropped away from
the business. Culwulla failed to make up the leeway,
and was eventually beaten by a shade over 4min.
In the B class race, Petrel, Aoma and Ranee really
started. Owing to want of breath Curlew failed to
reach the line in time, and got away 16min. behind
the tail end of everything that mattered. It was
hardly worth while beginning at all then, except on
the off-chance that the wind might freshen. Aoma
seemed to have everything its own way, but rounding
the ocean mark it was found that Petrel had been
creeping up, and was only lmin. behind. Petrel got
the spinnaker aloft first, and a splendid crawl ensued
between it and Aoma. Petrel began to creep up,
drew level, and passed, and won with 24min. to
spare.
* * * *
Although the breeze was no more than a
sigh, the open-boat crowd on Port Jackson con-
trived to get considerable excitement out of it, the
Sydney Club having quite a sensational finish. No
less than 21 boats started, and made a fine display,
every rag that the craft could carry being shaken out.
The winner turned up in Scot—a regular outsider
at the start, on of handicap—with Arline'
(4min. start) and Chris Webb’s Australian (scratch)
second and third. These three fought a very stubborn
battle, although the pace was deadly slow. It was
a fierce clamor of snails, and the extras blotted out
the landscape. Scot was very skilfully handled, but
Chris Webb excelled himself. In such a stagnant
atmosphere it was a wonderful performance to work
through that huge crowd of boats and finish third.
Murray Aunger’s dash from Melbourne to
Adelaide in his Dunlop-shod Prince Henry Vauxhall
motor-car was a good performance. The distance is
570 miles and includes 80 miles of general Sheol in
the Coorong Desert, where there is no road and often
not even a track ; a dreary waste of ruts, rocks, holes
and 6oft sand. Yet Aunger ran through the whole
distance in 14 hours 53 minutes, an average of 38§
miles per hour. The full merit of the performance
will be better realised when it is remembered that
the express train between the two cities, which runs
over only 483 miles of steel rails, takes 17hr. 56min.
to do it —an average of 27 miles per hour. Aunger’s
record is shr. 13min. less than the previous best, put
up by Mr. G. G. White. Of course, the frequent
stoppages are bad for the railway speed. If the two
capitals were joined by a mono-rail system over
which the non-stop trains flew at 70 or 90 miles an
hour, picking up and setting down passengers as they
flew, the motor-car would have no earthly chance of
putting this stigma on the railway, and the capitals
would be only seven to 54 hours apart. The chief
effect of Murray Aunger’s effort will be to bring
home to the minds of thoughtful people what a slow,
cumbersome business the two-rail railway is.
Tahmmy Burns and his kennel of pugs
arrived in Sydney on Monday this week, and took
up their quarters at Brighton-le-Sands. The string
consists of Arthur Pelkey, heavyweight; Fritz
Holland, a welter-weight, and Lee Johnson, a black
featherweight. Tahmmy himself has now settled
down to the chin-fighting job of managing. He is
much more rotund than in the days when he swung
dirty lefts and stopped ’em. The interesting person-
ality is Pelkey, who stands over six feet high, and
who, it is understood, is to meet Bill Lang. Pelkey
looks a very formidable customer, but judging by a
magnificent cauliflower ear which is among his
goods and chattels he must have been in the wars
some time or other. Burns, on the other hand, has
not one scar as a memento of his 56 battles. At
Sydney Johnson hit him 19 times on the jaw in three
rounds and never left a mark —and yet there are
people who regard Johnson as a mighty walloper.
As far as his face is concerned, Tahmmy might have
passed his life as pet preacher in a Little Bethel, or
chucker-out to a Peace Society.

Tahmmy Burns has an action for damages

Johnny Summers repeated his hurricane
act at Melbourne on Saturday night on the ribs and
head of Alf Morey, the Westralian boxer. Summers
declined to take his opponent seriously, and evi-
dently determined to make the contest brief and
merry. Morey was down for seven in the first
round, and for the rest of the round he fought a
rearguard action with very little luck. Summers
cut loose again in the second and Morey clung to
him frantically and wrapped himself round him.
In the fifth round referee Fullalove warned Summers
to keep a better rein on his head In the
seventh Morey was warned to hit with his fist and
not his forearm. Just after this Summers got his
head against Morey’s chest and commenced to play
the Devil’s tattoo on Morey’s ribs; but before he
could get reallv going Fullalove stopped the fight
and disqualified Summers for butting. Summers
nearly staggered back into the United States with
the shock, and explained that he always fought like
that, but Fullalove grimly declared he wouldn’t fight
like that in his ring; and that was the end of it.
Writer has always expected Summers to strike
trouble because of the way he jerks his head about.
It may not be intended to hurt the other fellow,
but a large number of him have been badly bumped
at times, and the day has evidently arrived for
Johnny to avoid the appearance of evil. It was bad
luck for him, seeing that Morey had no more chance
at this stage of the game than a tandsticker match
has against an ironclad.
“Bilrock,” from London: The wave of
boxing popularity in Paris has brought to light an
appalling ineptitude of the French language to
grapple with the sport. Up to date boxing parlance
on this side of the globe is essentially American.
Even the older English ring terms have given place
to the phraseology of B’rer Jonathan. But in spite
of the strong Yankee element that pervades the ring
in Paris, frog-eating scribes have been unable to
acquire a sporting style. They serve up a fight in
the diction of a housemaid’s novelette. Witness the
following par. from the account in the Matin of the
recent Langford-Jeannette contest: “Suddenly, again
coming out of a clinch, Jeannette receives a formid-
able hook in the mouth, which causes the blood to
flow. The unhappy man, whose eyes appear to seek
the succor of someone among those who, much moved,
watch this tragic end to the match, can scarcely
hold himself erect... .With hands uplifted, he seems
to implore the mercy of the conqueror. And the
anguish is such that only by an effort of self-
restraint can one check the cry of: ‘Pity, pity for
him!’ ” At the recent collision between the two
Johnsons (Jack and Jim) the management, in a
high-souled effort to educate the sporting fraternity,
introduced a “Petit Dictionnaire de la Boxe.’’ In
this little booklet it sought to reduce the technical
terms of the game (which an Australian boy learns
before the cradle-marks fade from his back) to the
lowest common French denominator. Ordinary fistic
phrases appear in English with definition opposite
each in idiomatic French. In the book I found such
streaks of wisdom as the following: “Punch (avoir
le) : It is said of a boxer who strikes very strongly.”
“Seconds out: Signal requiring seconds to evacuate
the ring.” “Groggy:- It is said of the boxer who
has been rendered stupid by the blows violent.”
Amongst the terms dealing with the conclusion of a
fight was “Knocked-out: It is said of a boxer who
has rested 10 seconds on the ground.” But I looked
in vain under this heading for an explanation of
such illuminative Australian terms as dished,_ outed,
stiffened, lined, walloped, put to sleep, laid out,
kyboshed and donkey-licked.

The meeting between Matt Wells and Ray
Bronson at Svdney Stadium on Saturday night was a
sad sort of business. It was Matt’s first appearance as
a welter-weight, and although Bronson weighed a
quarter of a pound more physically, he was about a
ton short in speed and skill. At first glance Wells
looked the heavier, but a second inspection showed
that Bronson possesses gigantic legs. Matthew, as
is his wont, started cautiously, but was soon quite
satisfied that he had nothing to fear from this hand-
some Yankee boy. He was beautiful, but he was not
warlike. The eagle-like Wells stood off, hovered
more or less, regarded the enemy critically, flapped
his wings a few times, and then biffed where and
how he liked. Wells was a splendid fighter when he
came here, and he is greatly improved. He hits much
harder than he used to, and yet his speed has not
deteriorated. Bronson smiled brightly through it all
and plugged slowly away—so slowly that when his
fist struck Europe Wells was always in Central
Asia. During the whole seven rounds he did not hit
Wells more than three times, except in clinches.
And at the close fighting as at the long range, Wells
outpointed and outwalloped the American very badly.
He beat him at every department of the interview,
and apparently he simply detested doing it because
the business was so one-sided. Once he sent Bronson
to the boards with a loud noise, and, quite for-
getting he was for the time being a gladiator and not
a Samaritan, he bounded forward and lifted the
horizontal one to his feet. Then he walked back
to where he jumned from. In the sixth round Wells
gave up har'd hitting and in the seventh he com-
menced to do the woodpecker act, iabbimr home
little short-arm left jolts, which found the mark every
time. Bronson was falling into the sere ana yellow
leaf, and was in the autumn of his scrap when his
manager ran round the ring and made a sign, and
the sponge tore through the air. Wells immediately
seized his opponent and held him up while he got
his second wind, and then assisted him to his
corner. It suggested Bulgaria holding up a stunned
Turkish Empire outside Adrianople.


MY HEALTH EXERCISES
PERMANENTLY CURE INDIGESTION.
Indigestion is NOT caused by the food you
eat. It is purely the result of a stomach
that has been ill-used —that has been shame-
fully neglected —that has been allowed to
rust, through want of exercise.
Very few people overeat. If the muscles
of the stomach are of normal strength, your
food will give you every particle of its nour-
ishing qualities.
My Health Exercises, for banishing indi-
gestion. quickly build up and strengthen the
muscles which govern the stomach —make
them easily able to assimilate the food —give
nourishment to every part of the body. Be
guided by the experience of others who’ve
benefited.
Bead these excellent reports :
“Your exercises have done me a lot of good.
I feel much stronger in every way, and get
better health. I used to suffer from indi-
gestion, but have not been troubled for some
time now.” —J.R.K., Wallendbeen, N.S.W.
“Those last lot of exercises have banished
all the aches and pains of indigestion, of
which I had a terribly bad attack the week
before I received your last letter.”

The Cult of Beauty
A RARE COLLECTION OF BEAUTY
HINTS FROM NEAR AND FAR-
HOME RECIPES.
How to Have Thick and
Pretty Hair.-^
“Home Talents.’’
Soaps and artificial shampoos ruin many beautiful
heads of hair. Few people know that a teaspoonful
of good stallax dissolved in a cup of hot water has
.■a natural affinity for the hair and makes the most
-delightful shampoo imaginable. It leaves the hair
brilliant, soft and wavy, cleanses the scalp com-
pletely and greatly stimulates the hair growth. The
-only drawback is that stallax seems rather expensive.
It comes to the chemist only in sealed packages,
-which retail at half a crown. However, as this is
-sufficient for 25 or 30 shampoos, it really works out
very cheaply in the end. *** For an actual hair-grower
nothing equals pure boranium. It is quite harmless,
and sets the hair roots tingling with new life. *** The
use of rouge is almost always obvious, but powdered
eolliandum gives a perfectly natural color and defies
detection.
To Kill Roots of Superfluous
Hair.
“Home Science.”
Women annoyed with disfiguring growths of super-
fluous hair wish to know not merely how to tem-
porarily remove the hair, but how to kill the hair
roots permanently. For this purpose pure powdered
pheminol may be applisd directly to the objectionable
liair growth. The recommended treatment is designed
not oidy to instantly remove the hair, but also to
actually kill the roots so that the growth will not
return. About an ounce of pheminol, obtainable
from the chemist, should be sufficient. *** For com-
plexions inclined to be oily many smart women are
now using just the natural allacitc of orange blos-
soms. It is perfectly harmless, makes a capital
greaselcss cream which holds the powder perfectly
and dors not encourage the growth of hair. *** Dis-
agreeable body odors can be instantly neutralised by
the occasional application of a little powdered
(white) pergol to the affected surfaces.
Using Oxygen for the
Complexion.
“Chemistry at Home.”
The well-known characteristics of oxygen may be
effectively applied to the renovation "of the com-
pletion. Mercolised wax, such as may be found at
any chemist’s, contains oxygen which is released
directly the wax comes in contaot with the; skin.
Oxygen consumes waste matter in the body, but does
pot; affeot healthy tissues at all. Therefore, it
attacks and removes the deadened waste accumula-
tions on the skin which show in the disfiguring form
of sallowness, moth patches and a general appear-
ance of lifelessness. The fresh young skin which
has been obscured by this disfiguring veil of waste
matter is thus allowed to show forth in all its
healthy beauty. The mercolised wax is absolutely
harmless, and indeed very beneficial to the skin. *** To
bring a natural red color to the lips, rub them witli
a soft stick of prolactum. *** For tired, hot or per-
spiring feet use a teaspoonful of powdered onalite ip
a foot-bath.
Emergency Complexions.,
“Novel Recipes.’V
Even a complexion which is hopelessly dull or
greasy can be made beautiful in a pioment by a
perfectly ‘harmless home recipe. If you have no*
ejeminito. in the house, get about an ounce from
your, chemist, and add only enough water to dis-
solve. it. Apply, a little to the face with tin; finger
tips. The process defies detection, and the result
is an immediate appearance of velvety, youthful
“bloom,” which every woman desires. The effect
will last all day under the most trying conditions,
indoors, or out, and renders powdering quite un-
necessary. This simple substance is also very good
for the skin, and no possible harm can come from its
regular use. *** To make the eyelashes grow long,'
dark and curling, apply a little mennaline with the
finger tips occasionally. It is absolutely harmless,
and. beautifies the eyebrows as Well. *** Pilenta soap
is the most satisfactory for all complexions. It even
works well in cold or hard water.

They have an arm as accu-

helps the Canadian

their skill.
The same care is used
in selecting material,
in boring and in sight-
ing “Ross” {sporting

result is that sportsmen
are as proud of their

The Inky Way,
Not many people think of “nifty” as an accepted
dictionary word with a nice meaning. The other
day it was told to Edmund Fisher, of this paper, that
he had come under the notice of a Melbourne lady
who afterwards inquired as to whether he was “the
man who writes the nifty poems?” The word sounded
like a sad reflection on the moral character of Fisher’s
verses, and lie blushed for himself. Then he looked
up the dictionary and found that “nifty” signified
“stylish.” Perhaps the compliment was unintended,
but he took it all the same. Also, he posted the fol-
lowing lines to the friend who told him of the other
lady’s query:—
Reuter’s correspondent at Peking, A. K. Wearne,
lately arrived in Sydney to spend a holiday in his
native atmosphere. Australia has sent some illustrious
journalists to China, chief amongst them, of course,
being Morrison, now adviser to that other astute
gentleman, Yuan Shih-Kai. Wearne reckons Morrison
will have a brilliant diplomatic career, and will
cause the harassed consuls of the nations to write to
Percy Hunter for a map of Australia, so that they
r can see wliat sort of a condemned place bred the man.
*•* * *
There was a lady correspondent (get that right)
at the Balkan shambles, and there isn’t anything
finicking about the chief opinion she seems to haye
formed about the business. She thinks—“she” is
Mary Durham—that Red Cross aid should not be
sent to battlefields. . Surgery does such wonders nowadays
that a big percentage of wounded are ready to rejoin
the scrap in 10 days, and that merely prolongs the
disturbance. Gentle Mary’s idea is that the sooner
both parties lose all the men they can afford to lose
the better —the sooner the others can then get back
to their donkey work, and bring some wages home for
the missus. There’s some sound sense and a lot of
rotten humanity in the lady’s summing-up of a
touchy situation.
* * * *
“J.F.H.”: Henry Lucy, “Father” of the House
of Commons press gallery, and best known now .as
“Toby, M.P.” of the dreary London Punch, has bej|n
pouring out his reminiscences, for goodness-knoWs-
how-long in the Cornhill, under the titty* of “Sixty
Years in the Wilderness.” But everything comes to
an endi excep,t eternity, and' Lucy’s rpjeanderings are
now in their last stage—“nearing tide Jordan,” 'as
he, labels the final instalments. • Towards the finish
he makes an allusion to Charles Gavan, Duffy as
“home from Australia bn a visit to the country
whence, earlier in his career he found it expedient
to take flight,” and seems to suggest that Duffy had
been sheep-stealing, or landlord-shooting, or something
of that sort. As a matter of fact, Duffy threw up
his seat in the House of' Commons and emigrated .
to Melbourne because he was sick of the political ;
situation in Ireland. He wasn’t transported for
shooting. Henry -Lucy or any other, annoyance. Lucy,
who becomes, in the heaviness of his style, more and
more, suggestive, of . Trollope’s famous William
Amelia,- awards the Irish oratorical championship,' to
A. M. Sullivan, who succeeded Duffy as editor of -the
Dublin Nation, and- whose, eloquence won ‘the
publicly-expressed admiration of Gladstone. A bro-
ther of Sullivan’s spent some years in Sydney as
editor of the Freeman’s Journal. He quarrelled
with the proprietors of the paper, and sailed across
the Pacific to become editor of another paper in
San Francisco.
Tlie first, issue of Maoriland’s ne\y metropolitan
evening paper, Christchurch Sun, apeared on February
6. It is a narrow baby of 16 pages, but it looks healthy.
Christchurch has now, three evening papers serving a
population of about SO,OOO, city and suburban. I-n its 1
introductory, remarks the. Sun says that it. removes ‘.‘a
source of surprise and wonder to visitors that Christ-
church people should be content to do without ap
evening paper that, in some measure, corresponded,
in size and influence to the evening papers of other
centre's of the Dominion.” Thus peace and goodwill
start on the old round with a club in one hand and,
an inkpot in the other.

London Timer, in its annual summary of the
events of 1.91j5, gives as “the most interesting and
probably the most influential feature of the year” in
England the mere fact of the “maintenace” of 1 the
two Labor dailies started in 1912. The Daily Citi-
zen, at a ha’penny, is the Labor party’s official,
organ, and is now “firmly established, though not
yet self-supporting,” the trade unions still having to
subsidise it. The Daily Herald is “rather a daily'
pamphlet than a newspaper.” It is “run by middle-
class capitalists, ’ and represents “,tlie Rebel move-
ment, the revolutionary tendencies of the day.” Both,
papers, the Times handsomely admits, have unoties-'
tionably exercised a great influence during the past,
year.

“Swan” : Who says all the genius is gone out of
religious writings? This '.is a verse from a poem in
a recent Methodist Times •
When we creep so slowly upward,
When each dhy new burdens brings,
When we strive so hard to conquer
Vexing sublunary things.
When we wait, and toil, and. suffer,
We are working for our wings.

“J. 0.8.”: James Martin, afterwards Chief Justice,,
published a queer little book of sketches in Sydney, '
in 1838. The young lawyer asked 6s. for his book-
let, -which was a trifling thing, with scarcely as
much in it as a bookstall could sell for 6d. to-day.
His onslaught on the poets, or pseudo-poets, brought
down showers of lampoons,' and the “Sketch Book”
was so ridiculed that the sequel the author professed
to have in hand never appeared. He notified, on a
fly-leaf: “This is the first literary production that
has emanated from a person educated in Australia.”
And to show either how full his hands were of other
matters, or how little he cared for his readers, he
added: “I sent each sheet to the printers as soon as
written and never revised any.” However, as being
the first literary production in book form by an Aus-
tralian-educated scribe, it is worth a place on a col-
lector’s shelf.
Wilson’s Sydney Street Directory is in-
valuable for the man who is chasing the bad
debt, and hasn’t time to ask 17 policemen
the way to its new address. There are 75
maps and plans, with all the streets alpha-
betically arranged and located.
NIFTY.
A poet in his latter days
Is glad to meet the honest gaze
Of any smart young creature
Who, be she widow, maid, or wife,
Expresses all the joy of life
In style as well as feature.
The furtive smile, the downcast eye
Denote a syren somewhat sly
And dangerously shifty:
She may have beauty of a sort
But no man reckons her a sport,
Or speaks of her as nifty.
The nifty “piece” in festive dress
Of ten stone weight, or even less,
Inclined to be unruly
(No saint from Heaven, nor a tart,
But quick of wit and warm of heart)
Appcaleth to Yours Truly.
A dowdy girl is rarely rash :
She has a keen regard for cash,
By nature she is thrifty;
Give me the girl with joyous face,
Who fain would ever go the pace,
And cut a figure nifty.

MODERN SUPERHEATED STEAM ENGINE GONSTRUGTION.
In regard to durability, reliability, steady running
and adaptability, Wolf Superheated Steam Locomo-
biles at least equal the best steam engine or turbine
plants of several 1000-h.p.
Their superiority in economy is attained by their
faultless construction, and in obviating the many
losses, including radiation, etc., which are unavoid-
able in steam plants having separate boiler and
engine.
Over Suction Gas Plants, Oil and Gs(s Engines, Wolf
Eocomobiles possess the following ; advantages:—
Cheaper cost of fuel; great reserve of power, allow-
ing overloads up to 50 per cent.; steadiness in run-
ning under extreme and sudden variation of load; use
of any kind of fuel besides coal; utilisation of steam
for heating or manufacturing purposes; easy attend-
ance, even by unskilled hands; Absolute Reliability
and Greater Durability; greater simplicity and con-
tinuously maintained economy also at lower loads.

“Deeby’s” anxious inquiry :
Why is Kosciusko set apart by the N. S. Wales
Government as a playground for wealth only? Such
& magnificent sanatorium should surely be made
available for city workers and others in need of a
tonic. Yet everything seems deliberately planned
to make this unique State mountain resort a mono-
poly for the rich, where money-bloated snobs can
foregather without the hideous possibility of meet-
ing no-bank-account toilers. It is necessary to
sojourn at the Hospice, as at present conducted, to
realise what a deep root that imported noxious weed
Snobbishness is taking in Australia. From my door
i see every car going to the Hospice, and, taken as
a whole, a more dismal-looking procession of blase
rich 1 have never seen, even at the tourist resorts of
Southern Europe. They get on my nerves. Specially-
reduced tourist fares to Cooma should be arranged
with cheap motor-car service to the Hospice. There
the tariff should approximate that of the average
country hotel. This would bring this recuperative
holiday trip within the reach of the people who
really'need it. Certainly the Labor Government did
make an attempt to provide a cheaper motor service
from Cooma, but the clamor raised by the local
motor monopolists scared the member into persuad-
ing the Government to withdraw the cars.
What “Deeby” overlooks is that Kosciusko
is not geographically a playground of Syd-
ney, any more than are the Andes or the
Himalayas, but is the natural summer re-
sort of the big city which should stand at
Twofold Bay. The fact that there is no
city there doesn’t entitle Sydney people to
be carried by train and motor-car at far less
than cost to the scene of action. At present
fares the N.S.W. railways don t pay. their
way, and at reduced fares they would show a
bigger loss. That means that the moderatciy-
well-off toiler who travels to Kosciusko is,
to some extent, a pauper, having part of
his expenses paid by taxes levied on tne
worse-off toiler who has to stay at home
because he can’t even pay the reduced fare
to Kos. Of course if the Sydney-Monaro
railway wasn’t the dead loss it is, cheaper
fares from Sydney to Kos. might be easy,
but while Sydney, by persistently supporting
a purely Sydney Government, insists that
that railway must be a bankrupt proposi-
tion, ending at a mountain village instead ot
at a big .rival seaport, the Monaro railway
must remain insolvent. Anyhow, the old
metropolis, with its Blue Mountains and its
rivers and bays, isn’t badly off for handy
holiday resorts. If it provided the people
of Bourke and Nyngan and Cobar and Hiin-
gerford and Milparinka and Brewarrina with
as good facilities for getting to (say) the
Hawkesbury as it enjoys for getting to Kos-
ciusko ,it would look rather less selfish than
it does.
From “Tarry Hope”
The effete Navigation laws of N. S. Wales and
Maoriland are allowing the White Australia policy
of Australasia to get some knocks below the belt, at
the hands of men who would feel hurt if told that
thay were selling their country, like Judas sold the
Christ, for thirty pieces of silver. Ships with col-
ored and cheap foreign crews are chartered and coal-
loaded in Newcastle, whence they clear they customs
for Java, Guam, etc., but sail direct for Maoriland
with their pirated cargo. It is well up to the
Government to get a move on with the Commonwealth
Navigation Act, and stop this little game. Until
the Federal laws declared the Shipping Combine
illegal, the Australian shipowner saw to it that no
outsider came in with cheap and colored labor to
undercut the trade that had ’been built up
by Australian men and money; he knew that
he couldn’t pay Australian rates for the
navigation of the ship, for ins repairs and
for his stores, and at the same ' time compete
against the Asiatic-manned ship. The Combine did
not tend to the advancement of a strong and abundant
Australian mercantile marine, but it at least at-
tempted to keep the Asiatic out of the trade, which
so far the Federal Government has failed to do. if
the latter does not want an Asiatic merchant service
in Australian waters to make a chimera, a delusion,
and a snare of the Australian Naval Defence scheme,
something will have to be done. What can a navy
be that has to defend a commerce manned by aliens l
Where will it draw its reserves from? Or is the
call to the sea and the navy to be a dead-end call
for Young Australia, with no merchant service to
fall back on when time-expired, or tired of the neces-
sarily more rigid ■ control -of navy discipline? No!
Unless the Federal Government is prepared to build
up and assist a white-manned Australian Mercantile
Marine it may as well stop fooling with an Aus-
tralian Navy, as the one without the other is worse
than useless. And if we drop the pavy we may as
well stop spending money in developing the Northern
Territory as a AVhite Man’s country. .
It may be said I am squealing before any hurt is
done, as' one or two ships do not make a mercantile
marine. Neither do one or two_ swallows make a
summer ; but they show summer is coming. And it
one or two ships with cheap colored crews are
allowed to engage with impunity in the Australian
trade, there will soon be a fleet of them. Now is
the time to settle the question whether it is to be a
white, black, or yellow Australia.
«► - ' '
Years and years ago the Vic. Indeter-
minate Sentences Board advised the estab-
lishment of a Reformatory Farm at an
estimated cost of £lOO,OOO. And now John
Weary has decided to get busy in the matter.
It is his intention presently to provide a
farm, reformatory and schools where mde-
terminates may be taught useful trades,
agricultural work, etc., at a maximum
cost of £3000! The idea doubtless is to
attempt the regeneration of one seasoned
sinner the first year ; and if he is thoroughly
reformed and doesn’t escape, and the man-
agers don’t grow too fat on the profits,
another tenner or so may be granted the
institutions next year, till there
are five or six or even more ; moral patients
undergoing treatment. A {paring scheme in
sooth —that is, when one'Considers who is
its author.
“Chudah”: The Lord’s people in Mel-
bourne- are somewhat disturbed by the pro-
posal to build a new Synagogue in Carlton,
which is a stronghold of the Faith. Indeed
the project has made such headway that
the land has been bought in Palmerston-
street, between Rathdown and Drummond
streets, and £5OO paid for it. The Rev.
Chodowski, from Maoriland, cuts out the
running, helped by Nathanberg and other
enthusiasts of Jewry; The synagogue in
Bourke-street West had a monopoly till the
Rev. Moses Rintel led a rebellion in 1857.
The issue was between English and non-
English Jews. The latter, splitting off.
furnished the fine East Melbourne Syna-
gogue. For a while there was bad blood;
but the pipe of peace was smoked and the
hatchet buried when Rintel moved on.
Nowadays harmony is complete between
Rabbi Abrahams in the West and Pastor
Lenzer in the East. The combine was dis-
turbed for awhile by still another newT-
comer, the St. Kilda Synagogue; then out
came the pipe again—all the more readily
produced in that case perhaps because long
ago St. Kilda had a luxurious little private
Synagogue, now the billiard-room of a
lodging-house.

MELBOURNE TO ADELAIDE
MOTOR CAR BEATS EXPRESS BY 3 HOURS
The Melboume-Adelaide Express averages 27 miles per hour for 483 miles
—along practically a level rail track. By road it’s vastly different: There’s
an 80 mile sand desert to negotiate, and hundreds of miles of rutty roads
and rocky bush tracks to drive over; yet Mr. Murray Aunger, of Adelaide,
averaged 38 miles per hour from capital to capital, covering 579 miles in
the wonderful time of 14 hrs. 54 mins. HE USED
DUNLOP TYRES
THINK WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE TYRES! THE STRAIN IS
TERRIFIC —for pace has to be maintained irrespective of road surface.
This is where the Remarkable Strength and Durability of Dunlop Tyres is
emphasised and appreciated, and where the Quality of Dunlop Material
and Workmanship is tested to the utmost, and proved Good and True.
The same features have made “ Dunlops” the most popular and economical
in Australasia to-day. THEY STAND UP TO HARD WORK, and they
should, for “Dunlops” are the Best Tyres made. It pays to use them!

IN BANANA LAND
E. W. Archer, of Gracemere, aspires to
succeed Fox as M.L.A. for somnolent Nor-
manby, and his success there is pretty cer-
tain. Archer is an old political war-horse
who represented Rockhampton for years
until he was defeated by “Wullie” Ividston.
The historic squatting families of Queens-
land are quietly creeping back to the State
Parliament; and Archer will give them
another representative.
In the middle of the Southern butchers’
strike Chief Justice Pope A. Cooper paid
his vacation visit to Sydney. He once went
on strike himself. He was circuit Judge in
North Queensland at the time, and some
friction as to expenses .arose between him
and the Department of Justice. The De-
partment was obdurate, so his Honor, after
an ultimatum, threw down his tools. Then
telegrams whizzed to and fro. the De-
partment yielded his Honor’s terms, and
capital and labor resumed their old relations.
The Chief Justice is a N.S.W. man, born
at Willeroo, his father’s station on Lake
George, but he gained most of his law know-
ledge in London. He was one time an
athlete, and is still a figure among the well-
dressed.
Queensland Home Department intends, on
the suggestion of Judge Chubb, to minimise,
if not wholly abandon, the system of pro-
ducing an accused person’s “record” and
keeping it for ever in evidence against him.
Minister Appel thinks that “photograph and
finger-print might be removed after a few
years from the Rogues’ Gallery.” The prin-
ciple of letting (say) 30 years’ decent citi-
zenship wipe out a previous smudgy record
is right; but it is very doubtful whether it
would be a good thing even for the criminal
to abolish altogether the system of producing
his “record” after conviction and before sen-
tence. The object of gaol nowadays is cor-
rective and reformatory, and the sentence
which might give a green hand the neces-
sary correction would be simply wasted on
the old hand.

■‘Youngsters nowadays go to the dogs early."

Abandoned Infant. —Common press headline.
How came it, luckless infant, that precisely
When other infants wander well and wisely,
Thou, thou, on whom we set such expecta-
tions,
Shouldst damn all hopes by wanton aberra-
tions?
Didst thou transgress from innate vileness
purely,
Yet hope to tread the primrose path se-
curely,
What time the erring youngsters with thee
ranking
Would howl beneath a stern maternal
spanking?
One scarce can think when gazing on thy
features,
So bland and smooth, most plausible of
creatures,
That evil’s rooted deep in such a midget.
Although thy pranks would make an angel
fidget.
“Abandoned Baby,” do they harshly call
thee?
The name, I notice, doth not much appal
thee.
And though they bend a chiding brow above
thee
Perchance a tender heart may somewhere
love thee.
What led thee, wee one, to thine earliest
tripping?
How came it that so soon thou went a-slip-
Ping?
Was it the babbling bad of some small
waddler
That turned thee to a sin-encrusted tod-
dler?
Or did the grimy cubs of Jones’s Alley
Deflect thy footsteps down Temptation’s
Valley?
And leave thee, tiled, a hapless, stranded
brother
Depraved and dirty—wailing for thy
mother?
I ask in vain. With steady gaze unblink-
ing
He answers not —no doubt he’s busy think-
ing ;
And munches on to get his little skinful.
And then goes on his devious ways and sin-
ful.
QUEENSLAND.
PHILANDER F.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, February 28. 1914.
My Dear Thargomindaii.—
This week has been dull socially and
gloomy meteorologically. It only required
the Presbyterian Elders’ Congress to be sit-
ting to have made it wholly depressing.
George V.’s stipendiary viceroy, satrap,
deputy-King, sub-Basileus, assistant-Pen-
dragon, Caesar, Protospathaire, Dauphin,
King of Rome, general-and-
admiral-at-sea —well, whatever his real title
may be, our wjell-beloved Macgregor went
out on Thursday in all his armor dressed
and chasing his snow-white plume in front
of him, and declared the Mary Vale railway
extension open for traffic. An eighteen-
penny advt. in the papers would have done
just as well, but that would have been a
low-down trick on the local mayor and the
shire councillor. Besides, this is the off
season for sheiks and ealdormen and pashas,
owing to the Parliaments being closed.
Every little job helps to fill in time and
catch np to the salary, or the squeeze, as
they call it in China, which is the same as
the boodle or the loot or the remuneration
or the honorarium or the pin-money.
The day before the momentous ceremony,
Acting-Premier “Bishop” Barnes tried his
hand at opening the Killarney Show, with
NOT GOING.
PUNTER (excitedly): “Say, old
chap, what chance has your
horse in this race?"
OWMER: “Sh! Speak softly of the dead."
the co-operation of Mrs. Barnes, the moral
support of some members of Parliament, and
the respectful attention of a brace of under-
secretaries. But the heavens went back on
him and wept mournfully.
.To-day the Governor will open the Tech-
nical College at Warwick. (What a handy
man he would be at Sydney just now, where
you appear to be Jiving on tinned goods!)
To-morrow he will unveil the obelisk to'the
memory of the late Joshua Bell, at Dalby.
Miss . Macgregor, accompanied by her
small niece, Honor Paget, is spending a few
days with the Cecil Roberts.
The Railways’ Jubilee was successfully
celebrated on Wednesday night, when hun-
dreds of officers of the Department, with
their ornamental halves, gathered at the
Exhibition Hall. The fact that the head of
the Department, Charles Evans, C.M.G.,
was lying ill in a private hospital in Syd-
ney was much deplored, more especially as
the occasion was to have been a dual one,
combining the jubilee With’ the pleasures of
a presentation to him on the eve of his
departure for England and America. In
the absence of her father, Miss Evans was
the recipient of the gifts, which included
handsome presents for the family. The
handing over of the order of C.M.G., which
was to have been the business of the Gover-
nor, was deferred.
At the civic welcome to General lan Ham-
ilton last week, a progressive M.P. ex-
pressed surprise and disapproval that the
North, of Australia was not to receive the
attention of the Inspector-General. Nastv
rumors are afloat up there that the Tburs-
day Island garrison is misplaced, and that
vessels entering Torres Strait are out of
range of the guns. The light-keeper at the
entrance to Darwin is telling a yarn that
one day may have a sequel. Qne dark night
recently he noticed what seemed to be the
glare from a vessel’s funnels. No lights
were shown on the phantom ship, and the
engines were silent. After some time the
mysterious glare was seen passing out
through the entrance.' It was shown on
inquiry that no vessel had berthed at the
Darwin wharves that night, but it was
known that the Japanese squadron had
passed Thursday Island a day or two pre-
viously. On the strength of this, Tliargo-
mindah, I am furbishing up mv St. John’s
Ambulance certificate.
A. H. Whittingham, M.L.C., and Mrs.
Whittingham were expected to return here
last night from their wedding trip to Eng-
land and the Continent. They will go into
residence at Mayfield, Ascot, a wedding gift
from the bridegroom to the bride. Mrs.
Mr., and Mrs. Alex. McNab and daughter
have been farewelled at great length and
high pressure this week prior to their flit on
Tuesday for America and Britain. The
flit there and back will occupy eight months.
Mr. and Mrs. E. T. White have also been
victims of the farewell cranks, who fall
upon the departing citizen with food and
fizz and flattery when he (or she) is burst-
ing his (or her) buttons in a wild attempt
to make a portmanteau close in time to
catch the boat. The Whites left for Maori-
land when they could tear themselves free,
and, at Auckland, will join the McNab party
on board the Vancouver-bound steamer. Mr.
White, who is a tooth plumber by trade,
will represent the Commonwealth and
Queensland at the Dental Congress to be
held at London in August.
Leslie Cohen, one of Brisbane’s eligibles,
has taken Blair Athol, the McNab residence,
and will live there during the McNab ab-
sence.
An engagement officially announced is
that of Dolly Schwabe to William Hay
Jefferson, of the Malay States. He is the
eldest son of J. M. Jefferson, of your city.
That jade, Runior, is making the rounds
again. This time she is bracketing the names
of two of our Society buds with those of
two. of our professional men. One is a
brilliant medico and the other looms large
in the legal community.
Whittingham is a member of the hospitable
Taylor family, whose home is Belle Vue
Station. Her trim little figure is well
known in the country show-ring, and she is
a fearless horsewoman.
A wedding brightened up Warwick last
week, -when Irene, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Moody, of the Q.N. Bank, Warwick,
was married to Colin Murray, of Mount
Watson station, fourth son of the Hon.
J. and Mrs. Murray, of Brisbane. The
ceremony was performed in the home of
the bride’s parents. The nest quitter wore
the regulation wedding dress, plus quantities
of Limerick lace, and sister Laura attended
as bridesmaid. After the breakfast Mr. and
Mrs. Colin Murray left by motor en route
for Sydney and Melbourne.
The Q.T.C. races came off to-day at Ascot
in dull and cloudy weather and an atmo-
sphere too steamy to admit of winter frock-
ing. Nothing very smart apneared on the
lawn. Mrs. E. K. Tully, however, looked
fresh and pretty in a lime-colored gown and
a black and white hat; Mrs. Gilbert Wilson
(lately returned from Melbourne) was slim
and cool in white ; Miss Bell of Coochin was
noticeable in purple silk and a white hat:
the handsome Sydney Jones sisters appeared
in grey and white respectively; and Mrs.
Iloy King (formerly Miss Preston, of Kim-
billi) was admired in white satin with an
overdress of pink.
Though the atmosphere is that of a Turk-
ish bath most of our shops are bravely dis-
playing their winter goods. Tango reigns
supreme, though to the unsophisticated eye.
even when carried out in exquisite material
and coloring, the tango underskirt
approaches closely the bulging breeches of
(he circus clown.
Talking tango reminds me that (lie ex-
citement of the week was a tango evening
given on Thursday by one of our dancing
experts. A number of invited guests, in-
cluding some of our Very Best, assembled to
pass judgment on Jhe much-criticised dance.
Exhibitions of stage and ballroom tango
were given and applauded.
Yours within sound of steady rain.
AUSTRALIA JANE.
The Queensland Opposition and a
majority of the Government’s supporters
favor a rise in the Parliamentary screw,
and will introduce it again next session;
hut neither crowd is game to put the matter
to a referendum. Both sides know quite
well that the public wants not to raise but
to reduce the cost of government, and that
it accepted Federation as a means to that
end; also they know r that the public of
Queensland is . hungrily' a'Waiting a chance
to vote for unification and reconstruction —
a change which would not only reduce cost,
hut wipe out various blazing anomalies and
produce more efficiency.
“Jack S.”: The new Yankee meat factory
by the haunted waters of the Brisbane River
is just now the Mecca of the hard-up but
strenuous of all classes. Considerably over
a thousand men are at work on the coming
beef, mutton and pork octopus. Busted bank
clerks shove the barrow side by side with
bush blokes and navvies. Cabs are provided
for the workers to and from the railway
station, and a big motor-launch bustles them
(the toilers) down and up stream night
■ and morning. .But when the morning steak
has the sky for the price limit, we shall
probably hear a different song from the
trusting and “trusted” Bananalander.
Bananaland’s chronic Liberal Government
is a casual concern. The Port Alma “guar-
anteed” railway line has just finished a
year. The estimated cost was £70.000, and
the guarantors were told that 15,000 tons
of freight at ss. the ton would pay. The
cost, however, climbed almost to £lOO,OOO.
Still the guarantors expected that, and
didn’t grumble much. But when the year
saw 28,000 tons carried over the or
nearly twice as much as the guarantors had
been told would pay exes., and when, never-
theless, a bill arrived claiming £2700 for
deficiency, those guarantors saw 'blue, and
swear they will charge the Government with
false pretences or bushranging or conceal-
ment of birth or something.
An interesting character of varied plumage
was Ebenezer Thorne, one-time Brisbane
journalist. Thorne dropped into Queensland
back in the ’7o’s, ran a Maryborough paper
into success and sundry libel actions, and
then drifted down to Brisbane, where he
assisted to found the Nord Attstralisciie
Zeitung, the Planter and Farmer, and
several minor ventures. He shone in those
days in Church circles, and, incidentally,
married twice over. A short time ago Maori-
hand papers told how a widow named Ber-
ridge had applied to the Public Trustee to
set aside the transfer of her property to one
Enroth, whose wife she had believed herself
to be —until she discovered that he had a
wife. living in Brisbane and a few others
surviving in England, and that two of these
ladies had kindly handed him most of their
property. Enroth and Thorne, it then trans-
pired, were identical. Incidentally, Thorne
was a smart pamphleteer, frequent local
preacher and Sunday-school teacher, as well
as professional bigamist. He died in 1911.
leaving nearly half a dozen supposed
widows to lament him. \

smaller rooms. It has most of the

Simplicicus: The proposition laid before
you is that ‘‘the farmer has to take the world s price
for his wheat, therefore he should be able to buy
his requirements at the world’s (Freetrade) price.”
It sounds like the theory: “Who drives fat oxen
must himself be fat.” Well (1) the farmer doesn’t
pay the world’s price for his land or the world’s rent,
either. These things are conditioned according to
what he can make out of the land even if he has to
export some of his wheat. (2) He doesn’t pay the
world’s price for railway freight on his produce.
Under State Socialism farm produce is carried on
specially cheap terms, and the extra heavy charges
levied on manufactured goods fill up the shortage.
) The farmer only exports prirt of his wheat. If,
for want of protected artisans here to serve as cus-
tomers he had to export a lot more of it, he would
probably get less money. When there are more pro-
tected artisans here, he won’t need to export at all.
14) The farmer needn’t grow so much wheat if it
doesn’t pay him. The crops of maize, barley, hops,
tobacco, cotton, etc., are always below the demand,
and even oats are usually in short supply. Also,
coffee and tea have haidly been tried yet, and this
country even imports timber at times. (5) Under
Freetrade. the farmer doesn’t get imported goods at
“the world’s price.” He gets them at the city im-
porter’s price, regulated by a sort of “honorable
understanding,” with freight added. That is why
the innocent agriculturist often pays £4O for a
foreign piano which costs £lO to build. .. .H.Y.P.:

L.M.S.: Quite out of The B.’s line. And written
without much knowledge of the subject, anyhow....
Officer 666: Your information re the alleged vagrant
who had been in a Vic. gaol at the time she was
represented to have been wandering the streets, would
be acceptable were it not about a month 01d....
Finebull • Secretary Law Institute, Sydney... .K.I.K. :
It got it R.N.C.: A pearl of no price. .. .Z:C.S.:
If the actor mangled -his English like that he deser-
ved to fail. . . D.M.: Jerry’s ghost is too slow on his
feet.... Hal: Your verse creaks. .. .H.T.8.: Poem
straggles and staggers pathetically down narrow
strips of paper, and generally resembles a singing
drunk making towards home by all the narrow lanes
he knows. .. .J.8.H.: A feeble rhyme—and there is
nothing more wretched... .Faust: That prayer won’t

Whv this feverish hurry to write a poem about the

firmed.... Beyah : Immoral story, but not sufficiently

Warm: The asides are apparently contributed by a

the young woman gave up school teaching to marry a
dairy-farmer and chase cows whilst attired Suitably
in dungaree pants is only mildly interesting as you
present it H.H.: It merely falls round whet; it
should go as the crow flies. . . .L.W.N. (Vic.) : We’ll

out of our line. ..-Author of Bushman’s Farewell:

that “even a Chinaman couldn’t make a decent living
at cement-manufacturing in Australia,” sicklied the
whole lot o'er with doubt. At least three concerns
have for years past been doing handsomely out of
cement manufacture in Australia. .. .E.W.: You say,
“Sir, I would be glad to know if it is any good.”
We say, “Sir, we are glad to reDlv it is no good.”

that yarn crossing the isthmus to Panama.... Teleko:
Thanks: always glad to read good copy from the
South Sea Islands, but uhotographs not desirable.
The suggestion! however, has been forwarded to the

about the pickles; at least, it was once upon a time.
So were the others.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
L.V.K.: Evidently some of your ideas are good,
but your drawing is very bad. Look at (11 the
drunken lady’s ankles, (2) the flat policeman’s
round, stiff tunic that doesn’t touch him, (3) the
absuid shovel or scoop on the back of his regulation
helmet. Then observe that his feet are different
sizes and that his pants appear to be on back to
front ; also, glance at the newsboy’s cap and ask
yourself if it is a fair thing. Buy some tuition....
Sievwright: Bad picture received with very old Lon-
don Punch *oi-a about the “’bus comoanv” charging
its passengers by weight. And you say it was “over-
heard in a Melbourne motor-bus.”
“327th Duke of Derrimut”: “G-up” (B.
12/2/’l4) says Queensland’s Governor is
the poorest public speaker he has met. The
Chiel has no oratorical flourishes. He has
a weak throat, picked up fighting malaria and
filaria on some Outpost of Beyond, and even
his best friend couldn’t accuse him of
humor. But it isn’t correct to say that he
is a poor speaker. He is a fluent speaker for
a Scotchman. The main trouble is that he
wants to be useful —to give advice. He
takes his job seriously. When he gets into a
district where the soil is shrieking for super-
phosphate he gets right on to that subject.
Just as he is warming up some empty-headed
idiot starts to giggle, and “the old man”
shuts like an oyster. He then produces an
old envelope on which he has made notes
and says: “Before I declare the show open,
I’d like to refer to the women’s work. It is
gra-and worrk. I saw some beautiful em-
broidery in the building, and the hem-stitch-
ing is the best I have seen anywhere,” etc.,
etc. When he finds the crowd isn’t inter-
ested in decent stuff, he supplies what Joe
Cook would call “tripe.” Perhaps “G-up”
was one of the crowd that looked as though
it wanted tripe.

greatly from skin trouble which was con-
fined to my head. It commenced with
severe irritation of the scalp, and the con-
tinual scratching consequent upon this
caused small sores to appear.
“I heard of the Cuticura Remedies and
sent for a sample of the Cuticura Ointment
and used it as directed along with Cuticura
Soap and these very speedily relieved and
I can now say have completely cured me,
as the irritation and sores have quite dis-
appeared. The Cuticura Soap is, I con-
sider, so nice for toilet purposes.” (Signed)

it was a skin eczema and would wear away
in time, which it did not. I sent for the
sample tin of Cuticura Ointment as adver-
tised, and had such faith in it that I bought
a large tin of Cuticura Ointment and two
cakes of Cuticura Soap and they cured him
completely.” (Signed) Mrs. E. J. Richards,

If you would like to see the alteration Grey Hairs
make, just lay a piece of paper over each of the two
halves of the above portrait. The Grey “half” will
then be seen to have the appearance of 45 years of
age, whereas the other half looks only 30. Dr. B.
Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut Stain will make
all those years of difference if you are grey or prema-
turely grey. It is perfectly harmless, easy to apply,
and will quickly restore the Hair to the natural shade
of youth, or younger years.

New Preparation
Causes Big Scare Among Hair Specialists.
My True Hair Grower has a most wonder-
ful effect upon the hair glands and tissues
of the scalp. It is the only remedy for the
hair ever discovered that is similar to the
natural hair foods or liquids of the scalp.
It penetrates the pores quickly, and the
hair soon shows the effects of its wonder-
fully exhilarating and life-producing quali-
ties.
Besides being a True Hair Grower, my
preparation quickly removes DANDRUFF,
and stops FALLING HAIR and ITCHING.
It is known the world over, and I have in
my consulting-rooms upwards of 3000 grate-
ful letters from men and women who have
derived so much benefit from the use of my
True Hair Grower as to compel them to
write and thank me.

South Bundaleer, one of the last of S.A.’s “big”
estates lying within the range of safe rainfall and
therefore of safe wheat-growing, has been cut up by
Elder, Smith and Co., and sold for J. F. Maslin, the
owner. It was divided into 18 blocks, varying from
500 to 2500 acres, and in half an hour they were all
sold. The top price was £8 an acre, and the average
over £5.

A booklet, entitled “Milestones,” has just been
turned out by an energetic follower of the Inky
Way, J. AY. H. Bannerman, who lives at The Bluff,
away at the lower end of the Great Loan Land, where
you only need to take one jump to land at the South
Pole. The booklet contains the stories of all the
shipping disasters that have happened in Southern
Maoriland in the last hundred years; and, although
it doesn’t wander far afield, it records no less than
160 wrecks. This gives some idea of the sort of
trap the M.L. coast is. Bannerman’s book gives fairly
lengthy accounts of all the famous disasters, from the
General Grant to the Tararua; and mention is even
made of such ancient smash-ups as the Boussole
(1788) and the Endeavor (1795). For sub-editors
it’s a handy publication; but it’s to be hoped it
doesn’t fall into the hands of Lloyds’, or premiums
on shipping to Maoriland will shoot skywards.
The exactions of the working classes are dreadful;
and, as every Right Thinking Person remarks 10
times a day, things can’t go on like this. There is
the cost of haircutting in Melbourne, for instance.
A while ago it was sixpence. Then the brigands who
use the scissors got an extra 10 per cent. Ten per
cent, of sixpence is an absurd fraction of a penny;
and how could customers carry round absurd frac-
tions of a penny? The result was that the master
hairdressers had to collect an extra threepence, hand
the absurd fraction of Id. to the brigands, and put
the other 2 id. or so into the till. It was a most
painful thing to do; but how could the master-
barbers escape taking just four times more of a
rise than the brigands got ? True, a few did say it
was a “bit tough,” and refused to put up the price
at all; but these are a dull lot, who don’t know
how to grab the skirts of opportunity. They are
almost as dull as those few Sydney grocers who
wouldn’t put up the price of preserved fruit the
other day when the butchers struck.
* * * *
A faint echo of the Maoriland strike reached
Wellington the other day, in the shape of 6000
tons of cheap coal, per tramp steamer Border Knight,
from Moji, Japan. When the down-tools fever struck
The Great Loan Land last year, Capital immediately
hurled cables all over the planet in frantic pursuit
of something to cook the roast duck with. So a
small fleet of boats, loaded with derned poor coal, is
hurrying towards Massey, and someone is going to
drop a hatful of money over the business.
* * * *
“J.P.”: The dear little Japs who were last in
Wellington (M.L.) with a couple of cruisers took
away a Maoriland rug apiece to hide their smiles
and cover up the plans of the local fortifications.
When they got back to Japland they advertised that
they’d got sample rugs for sale, and the local woollen
factories swooped down and bought the lot. The
result is that rugs are now being turned out by the
Darlings of the Gods which, as far as outward appear-
ance goes, are an exact imitation of the famous
Maoriland goods; and, as foreign orders are being
booked for the piracies, the men in Maoriland who
patted the little Japs patronisingly on the head are
saying things that can’t be printed in a paper which
Billjim mostly keeps for his Sunday reading.^
“Jonfa”: They were city-bred, both on the right
side of 30, and as keen as mustard. Old man Mel-
ville, when he passed in his cheques, cashed out for
10,000 sovs., and his sons decided to let sheep in-
crease and multiply it. They read all the sheep-
literature within hail, and what that didn’t teach
them, old Goldsby, the manager of Floddey Downs
(who was reckoned the shrewdest man in the West)
did. He, of course, had the very thing to suit them
—two adjoining grazing farms, each 26,000 acres,
and stocked with 14,000 ewes. The price was only
enormous—not more than that. The farms had no
water supply of their own, but the water from the
big bore of Floddey Downs ran through them. The
brothers were delighted, but they had to admit their
exchequer wasn’t equal to the deal. Goldsby told
them not to let that little matter worry them. He
drove them into town and introduced them to
Jobson and Co., where they were accommodated.
There had been a dry spell for a while, but for the
next four months things went well with the brothers.
Then came a letter from Goldsby, regretting that
he had to inform them that after two days the
water supply from Floddey Downs would be cut off.
The Melvilles were up against it. The ewes were
heavy in lamb, the nearest bore and scour was 30
miles away, and a dry stretch in between. They rode
over and interviewed Goldsby. He told them how
sorry he was, but the dry weather made it impera-
tive. So they begged him to take the sheep. After
much hesitation he agreed, as a favor, to take them
at 6s. a head. Melvilles hadn’t got back home 20
hours when it started to rain, and it didn’t stop
until the gauge registered 6in. Two days later over
came Goldsby with some station hands. The elder
brother met him, thanked him and said it would not
now be necessary to sell. Old Goldsby from his
saddle reminded him that business was business.
They mustered the sheep, which were now worth 14s.
a head, and Goldsby handed over a cheque for £4150.
The brothers held on for two months longer, then in
stepped Jobson and Co. and made a few remarks.
In six months, in a fairly good season, Melvilles had
dropped £lO,OOO.
HUSH! NOT A WORD!
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The financial outlook is not too bright.... The im-
ports of the Commonwealth are down very consider-
ably ; hence the Ma State will be about £500,000 to
the bad on the next Federal Budget. .. .The money
market is rising again.... A severe drought is raging
on the North Coast. ... Ditto, ditto on the South
Coast.... The West is that dry it can’t spit.... The
Cotter and Molonglo “rivers” at the capital site have
ceased to run.... The Murrumbidgee has nearly ceased
to run.... The Nepean has ceased to run. .. .The
debt (about £118,000,000), on the other hand, is
doing nicely; interest is still running, and presently
N.S.W. also will be running for more loans.

Let others rave! no matter what the news may be —
good or bad or only sad —we see not, nor are seen !
Who breathed of Drought ? Pish! not worth con-

abound ?
Out, croaker, out! You’re nothing but a niddering !
Can there be Slumps while UNCLE lends a
pound ?
Soft! whisper low; a crisis may be nearing us; great
Mammon, help us in our sore distress!
What do we owe? S-s-ssh ! UNCLE may be hearing
us! What matters it a million more or less?
Still —ah! keep still! you’ll put the blessed show
away; why do the papers even hint at Drought?
Think of our bill, and pray the gods to blow away
heat, sun and dust that put good times to rout.

Oh, hear us swear (beneath our breath) to be

Is undoubtedly the most valued preparation ever compounded for external application, because it
is the most reasonable and scientific of modern medicines. It is totally different from any otlic-r
limiment on the market, and contains rare products not previously employed in like preparations.
It will penetrate to your very bones, soothe, soften and subdue all aches and pains. It is an
antiseptic and germicide of the highest order. Applied to a wound, it prevents germ infection,
avoids the danger of blood poisoning or lockjaw, and any wound heab five times as quickly as
without it, and heals like a surgical wound, without inflammation.

Kephadol is the doctors’ remedy. It was dis-
covered by a noted doctor —is used by doctors
prescribed by doctors —and most enthusiastically
endorsed by doctors.
It does not affect the heart action. It can be
safely taken in large doses for exceptionally bad
cases, and it is guaranteed to be totally and wholly
harmless. It is registered under the N.S.W. Pure
Food Act, 1908, and its use does not disappoint.
Experience has taught us that, once used, no other
remedy has a chance of substituting it.

In 2J years the population of Sydney has in-
creased by 89,000, or at the rate of 4.9 per cent, per
annum. Should it continue to increase at that rate
during the next few years, then towards the end or
1920 the metropolis will contain 1,000,000 inhabi-
tants. Meanwhile the population in some ot the
country districts is steadily decreasing.
She lured you in from the scented Bush
with her storeys and her spires- - .
From out where the battered billies boil on
the eucalypti fires.
You have come from where the hills are tall,
and from where the plains are wide;
For her call went out, and we heard you
shout: “Ho, ho! for Sydney-side!”
She made you tire of the wide blue sky and
the tracks that were yours to roam
Till all you saw were the harbor lights and
the sheen of the silver foam.
She filled your hearts with the wander-lust,
and it would not let you be —
For it made you long for the fevered throng
and the salt of the open sea!
She set her lights in her sable cloak, and Oh !
like gems they gleamed
Till yours were the dreams, O restless ones,
that were better left undreamed !
For yon left the pick, and you left the spade,
and you left the stampers’ roar,
And you sacrificed your strength—enticed
by the Siren on the Shore.
You dropped the shears in the outback shed,
and you left the axe in the scrub,
And you turned your back on your mother-
Bush with a smile that was half a snub.
You left the paddocks of golden wheat and
the crops of tasselled corn,
Because she blew for the ears of you her
honey-musicked horn.
The rowels rust that once were red, and un-
used on the stable wall
Are hune the ribbons that guided once the
noblest horse of all.
The morning rides, and the twilight rides,
and the long rides in between
Are no longer yours—for she lures and lures
the Shall from the Might-Have-Been!
She hemmed you in with a smoky pall; and
she flings against your ears
The cries of unnumbered broken hearts and
the sighs of uncounted years.
She turned you into a lielnless throng, and
she worked you night and day
Till you long once more for the unlocked
door and the open, sunlit way.
Oh, she is a luring, heartless one, and you
are her bonded slaves.
And you’ll loathe the sight and the sound of
her till she plants you in her graves.
She dries your souls to withering husks, and
your brains with madness whirl —-
Because you turned from the Queen you
spurned for a seaside dancing girl!
She has lured you in, and she holds you
fast; and so till the day you die.
You’ll lona for the hush of the sunlit Bush
and the stars you wandered by.
You had your choice, and you made your
choice, and so your choice must be —
But Oh ! for a road and a gipsy’s load and
the faith of the fancy-free !

The Double-bed Dialogues.
THE FIRST QUARREL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
IT all happened because I forgot to kiss
Babette on the nape of the neck. She
has an adorable and eminently kissable
nape; and, though I necessarily have had
a limited opportunity of comparing and
classifying women’s napes—l can conceive
of no more delightful and useful profession —
I am inclined to declare that the nape of
Babette is the most beautiful in the world.
Perhaps this is because I discovered Bab-
ette’s nape by myself, unaided. Before I
triumphantly announced my discovery to
her, she had been quite unaware that she
possessed a nape at all. Thus I have, as it
were, unalienable rights of possession to my
discovery.
Of course I have no excuse for omitting to
kiss her nape. It was there, waiting to be
kissed. But for my otherwise inexplicable
omission the only thing I can blame is Bab-
ette’s evening dress. Babette, in addition to
being my wife, is, it might be mentioned, a
woman. And, despite the fact that she has
been my wife for three months, she persists
in remaining a woman. Hence every dress
of hers is, with one exception, buttoned or
hooked or tied or pinned at the back, the
only place in the human anatomy that
your fingers are unable to reach. The one
exception in her trousseau was her night-
dress, which, as far as I could discover, did
not button or hook or tie or pin up or down
anywhere. She just flowed into it somehow.
But the rest of Babette’s attire needed
more putting on that that. In fact, dressing
with her was more in the nature of a cata-
clysm or a building operation, triumphantly
conducted under a series of harassing and in-
tricate municipal by-laws. But she was not
the architect of her own fashionable loveli-
ness. It is true that she laid the founda-
tions of her fortune herself. To begin with,
she had a figure that could be, as it were,
comfortably poured into the shapes demanded
by each succeeding fashion. How she
managed it it is not my province to tell; but
if certain gentlemen in Paris suddenly de-
creed that every woman in the world should
dispense with hips, within a month Babette
was hipless. And if those interfering Paris-
ian males ukased straight fronts, Babette’s
curves straightway became straight.
And on this plastic foundation —or would
it be more accurate to term it plasticene?—
she built up, layer by layer, the diaphanous
swathings necessary. Mere brickwork, this
—foundation stones of silk and openwork and
lace, ready for the reinforced concrete of
corsets, bracing the beautiful edifice with a
multitude of tapes and elastic bands. But
the final coat of paint, the final surface orna-
ment, was left for me.
She would call me when she was ready—
usually when I was in the midst of that
tremendous struggle with my tie. I would
find her in front of the glass, with a strained
look and the preliminary layer of powder on
her face. She would indicate the gap in her
back, through which I could discern the
lovely nape treated of in this chapter, the
foam on the surface of her slip bodice, and,
lower down, a barricade of intricate tapes.
“Begin at the top,” she would command.
“There’s a hook —or there ought to be —some-
where hidden among the lace. See that you
get the right hook, so that the trimming
meets, and go right down. The lining first,
of course. Don’t touch anything but the lin-
ing till you’ve got that done. And be quick.
We’ve only got half an hour, and I’ve got to
powder my neck yet.”
A man’s fingers, even a husband’s fingers,
are not built to manipulate microscopic hooks.
He is not naturally clumsy ; but there is no
purchase in hooks that must be strained to
hidden eyes. The task is difficult enough if
you are dealing with a stationary figure; but
you are dealing with a woman. It is like
trying to thread a needle in a sewing-machine
going at full speed. And Babette insists on
me hooking her up in darkness. No matter
how often I place her back to the light, with
the light coming from behind my left
shoulder, she manages to wriggle round. She
explains that she wants to see how she looks,
but she had been doing that for the past hour.
And there are so many hooks. Usually I
get twenty-three hooks securely fastened be-
fore I discover that there is one hook that
hasn’t any discoverable eye. I announce this
startling discovery to Babette, and she exas-
peratedly bids me look for a missing hook up
at the top. Then I have to unhook twenty-
three hooks and begin again.
But it is as I approach Babette’s equator
that I brace myself. She is adorably slim ;
but no woman is nowadays built slim enough
for the waist she wants. Babette helps: she
holds her breath for a full minute —and no
modern woman is patient enough to stand
that torture without damage to her temper.
Not that Babette has a temper except at
crises such as these.
So I manage clumsily and methodically to
get the lining braced tight, and, with a con-
fusing series of instructions, I somehow get
the rest of the dress, flimsy stuff that seems
too delicate to handle, adequately hooked.
Then comes my final degradation. I have to
put in the last pin. I have never understood
the need of that final pin. You would think
that somewhere in the world some super-
woman of a dressmaker would anticipate the
need of that final pin and put a hook and
eye there. But none of Babette’s dressmakers
have had that bright idea.
It is at moments such as this that I wildly
invent a dress that will fix up at the back
by a single, turn of a small Yale key. All
you have to do would be to bring the gaping
parts together, insert the key and snap the
lock. I suggested this idea to Babette once
while I was hooking her ; but I’ve decided
not to mention it to her again.
Well, I get her hooked up somehow ; and
it takes her all the journey to the theatre
before she forgives me.
This crisis occurred quite early, in our
honeymoon. I believe it happens in every
honeymoon. And it keeps on happening all
through married life. And the percentage,
of unhappy marriages, they say, is steadily
rising.
But the unhooking of your wife is the
grimmest test of marital courage. You are
tired. The material you work on is tired.
Your fingers, scarcely recovered from their
earlier task, are quite unfitted for delicate
operations now. Again you must begin at
the top, and usually there is in Babette’s
evening dresses a tiny thread that mercifully
keeps Babette from plumning out of her
dress ,al together. It is hidden away, tucked
down her back. It has to be fished up and
carefully untied. And there are seven pins
where you distinctly remember putting only
one. And five more in quite unexpected
places. And, probably because it is after
her supper, the unhooking of the king pin at
her waist is a task that requires physical
strength allied with deftness never met with,
in the human race, except in the rare case of
happily married males.
But. as at last Babette gives her body
that animal wriggle to make sure that no
hook still holds, there is the benediction to
be pronounced on a good work done. This
is the soothing ceremony of kissing Babette’s
perfect nape. The first time I had the in-
spiration to do it she was surprised and
delighted; every time I do it she is sur-
prised and delighted. Unfortunately this
evening, in sucking my thumb from a hook
that had meanly reared itself on end and
stabbed me, I forgot her nape. I had not
bestowed a thought upon her nape, though
it was staring me in the face, from the
moment that her waist had leapt open.
Of course, Babette did not remind me.
No wife ever does —at least, just then. She
has to work up to it, to think hard of all the
other times when her husband has shame-
fully neglected her, to arrange the list of his
omissions in order, and to work up a sulk
sufficiently sulky to make him sit up and
take notice. This does not always result.
Many a misunderstood wife has gone to
infinite trouble to produce a sulk; and her
husband hasn’t even noticed that she was
any different, simply because he was specu-
lating on the chances of Grey Prince for the
Cup.
This night, after we had got into bed, it
gradually dawned on me that Babette was,
for her. extraordinarily monosyllabic. But
I sleepily put it down to the possibility that
she was sleepy, too, and comfortably lay
silent, hoping that soon her monosyllables
would lengthen into snores. I had not
neglected to say good-night. Certainly it
was a perfunctory and unimpressive one —
honeymoons won’t last for ever —and sug-
gested putting out the light.
She had been waiting for this. “Didn’t
you forget something to-night?” she quietly
ftskfid
I thought of the back door —yes. I re-
membered locking that; and the hall gas —
that was certainly out. I was too sleepy to
think of the cat.
“What?” I yawned.
“When you unhooked my dress.” ■
“Did I leave a pin sticking into you?” I
anxiously asked. “I am certain I only stuck
in three, and I pulled out twelve. Did I
miss one, after all?”

KIDNEY DISEASE PREYS ON THE MIND
The patient who has to keep getting up in the
night knows there is something seriously wrong with
his kidneys.
It preys on his mind, for kidney disease is well
known to be one of the hardest diseases to cure.
Patients are, therefore, very apt to grow disheart-
ened, but much may be done, even in advanced cases,
by careful dieting, and a thorough course of Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills taken in regular doses after
each meal with a glass of water. This flushes out the
kidneys and urinary system, and disposes of the
excess uric acid, which is the great cause of: —
Gravel, Urinary Disorders,
Distress in Relieving tRe
Bladder, too free a flow.
Dropsy, Backache,
Pains in tRe Loins,
Heart Attacßs, Lumbago,
Dizziness and Faintness,
Unnatural Drowsiness,
Rheumatism, Sciatica.

NOTE.—Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are not
for constipation, or disorders of the liver, stomach
and bowels. They are solely for the kidneys and
bladder, and regulate the urinary system like laxative
medicines regulate the bowels. They are safe for
all—men and women, old and young.

Sydney People Cured
' A SYDNEY MAN.
Mr. George Woodroffe, 10 Roseby Street, Drummoyne,
Sydney, writes : “I derived very great benefit from the use of
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. I have been a great
sufferer with the kidneys for the past 17 years. My suffer-
ings started with a cold, and eventually inflammation of the
kidneys and bladder set in. I have been treated by some of
the cleverest and best known Sydney doctors, and was for
17 i weeks in the Sydney Hospital. I was also two months
in the Coast Hospital, where I had one kidney removed.
Though the various treatments eased me for a time, I was
not cured, and would soon relapse into my_ former ill-
health. I also tried patent medicines advertised to cure
kidney complaint, but they did not even give me temporary
relief. My brother was always worrying me to try Doan s
Backache Kidney Pills, if I took only one bottle. To please
him I got them, and before I had finished the bottle I felt
extraordinarily well. I had not felt so well for years; the
pills were working wonders for me. I continued taking
them, and am now perfectly cured of every symptom of
kidney trouble.”
Mr. Woodroffe confirms the above eight years later:
“My cure has lasted, for I am still free of every symptom of
kidney and bladder trouble. All sufferers should know about
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”
A SYDNEY WOMAN.
Mrs. E. Wilkinson, 29 Campbell Street, St. Peters,
Sydney, says: “For some time I suffered agony from lum-
bago-like pains across the small of my back. These pains
prevented me from bending or getting proper rest at night,
and seriously hampered me when attending to my household
duties. Sometimes I was so bad I could hardly move, and it
I tried to get about the house the pain was almost unbear-
able. My kidneys, I knew, were very much out of order,
and were really the cause of my constant suffering. I tried
all sorts of medicines in the hope of getting well again, but
was not successful in finding a remedy that suited me. At
last a friend recommended Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills,
and they did me good almost at once. After taking two
bottles of these pills I was ever so much better, and eight
bottles completely cured me. That was 12 months ago, and
I have been well ever since. I always keep a bottle ot
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills in the house and take a dose
occasionally, and they keep me in splendid health.’

“You missed me,” she mournfully said.
I remembered, and suddenly was wide
awake. I knew it would be an all-night
sitting. “Never kissed your nape? By
Jove, no more I did! Meant to; but you
were in such a hurry and such a wriggle
and there were so many pins, and they had
S ° pomts
‘ There now!” cried Babette. It’s no use
trying to put the blame on me. Just
like a man! I’ve been waiting all this
while to hear your explanation—your
apology. You’d clean forgotten it. There’s
no excuse. There was my neck, and I was
helpless—and you didn’t kiss me. Henry !”
Her voice was tragic—and I love it like that.
Henry, you simply don’t love me any more!”
u Babettelans!’ I cried in my anguish,
you can’t mean that?”
You re beginning to tire of me,” she
mournfuHy insisted. .
Absurd ! I said, beginning to get rather
frightened. “Just because I didn’t do a little
thing like that!” _
Babette sat up in bed, looking like Venus
rising from the foam of her nightie.
“Henry,” she said gravely and sorrowfully,
vvith a wounded sadness in her young eyes,
“it’s just because it was such a little thing
that I know. It’s just the little, trivial
things that count. It has set me thinking,
and looking back. This is the beginning of
your disillusionment. You do not care for me
—not in the way you used to care. I always
knew you idealised me, and I’ve always been
afraid, even on our wedding day, that you’d
find out. I used to hide that switch, and I
made up my mind never to let you see my
f . ,
Babette s teet are charming feet, as
women’s feet go. She has always worn tight
shoes; and tight shoes have taken their in-
variable revenge. Her little toes are
twisted and curled, like parsley, and there
are three corns on her right parsley-leaf
and two, but larger, on her left. In her
arVi IC i, lOOkS c ha rmmg-but underneath
she is bffihous. I wonder how many hus-
bands have ever seen their wives’ feet?
Babette was near to tears. There is only
one thing to do when a man’s wife—or
another man’s wife—is near to tears. I sat
up to do it. My wife wouldn’t allow me to
kiss her!
f/ T ri ® ls ! ~,,,,
. I knew you would do that, she gloomed
miserably. “You think I’m a weak woman,
You men think that everything is made all
right at once by a kiss. No. Nothing—
nothing you may do will wipe away the
memory of the lass you forgot to give me on
my neck! That will always remain like a
scar on my soul. I shall always feel there
is something wrong with my neck.
“Not that it matters in itself,” she went
miserably on. “I was disappointed, of
course—not that I wanted it, but because I
thought you liked me enough to want to kiss
rue anywhere and any time you got the
chance. And you had all my neck and
shoulders, too! No; it’s a warning to me.
You re losing interest in me. I suppose all
find that out. But I thought you would
be different—indeed, you promised, solemnly
promised, that you would be. And now—
you’re just like the rest of husbands !”
, ‘, Let explain!” I began, not that I
had anything to explain; but if I let her
go on she would work herself up, and the
would go on till breakfast-time,
“w no Henry,” she sadly said.
-Nothing could explain that kiss away. It’s
only another sign. Once when you came
home from the office you took off your
goloshes before you kissed me. And last
Thursday week, when you were running for
your motor-’bus at the corner, you forgot to
wave your umbrella to me. though you knew
I was watching for it at the window.”
Last Thursday week?” I wondered. “I
can t remember, that day at all.”
t It was raining hard, teeming.”
And you expected that I would stop in
the pouring rain and whirl my umbrella in
the wet and get the rain down my neck, just
because you were standing comfortably in a
warm room, watching me splash through the
mud !”
I was angry with Babette, and yet de-
lighted. (she had unconsciously given me a
chance to defend an action of mine—-a thing
I could not do about the omitted kiss. If I
could only be sufficiently indignant about
this charge she might forget all about her
neck.
But she had the superb suburban strategy
of all wives. She abandoned details. She
advanced her battalions to the attack by a
general charge. “There,” she exclaimed, “I
knew you’d revile me. That only shows that
you wouldn’t care if you never kissed me
again—-until, perhaps, you kissed me in my
coffin !”
This was so unfair that I told her angrily
that I hadn’t the least desire to kiss her as
long as she said things like that.
And then I had an inspiration. It was
only a chance shot, but I decided to fire it.
And about that kiss on the nape,” I said.
I in sure you didn’t remember that I hadn’t
kissed you till you got into bed.”
“Oh!” she said angrily—so angrily that
I knew I had hurt her unfairly. “How
could you think such a thing? What must
you think of me to say a thing like that!
It just shows me how little you care for me.
Oh, I was warned, everybody warned me,”
she wailed.
Heart-stricken I listened to her sobbing.
It was the first time that I had heard my
wife really settle back and tackle the job of
sobbing. Afterwards, of course, I got used
to it. But now it seemed to me as if the
end of the world had come, as if all that
was left of our lives was being steadily and
ruthlessly submerged beneath those stream-
ing tears. I felt like Noah as he looked out
from the ark and contemplated his drowned
rain-gauge. I had really begun to wonder if
the sheets had better not be changed. I
was always afraid of rheumatism.
Desperately I attempted to take her in
my arms—a difficult enough job when both
parties are sitting up in bed, and now un-
utterably complicated by Babette’s wet and
crumpled appearance. She shook me sadly,
moistly off. I spoke endearments to her,
called her by all the silly pet-names of the
honeymoon. She merely wept the more deso-
lately. If only she would interrupt those
shaking sobs to say something more intel-
ligible !
“Speak!” I cried. “Say something—any-
thing !”
“Ge-ge-ge-get me a handkerchief!” she
wailed. “A big one. One of yours!”
I climbed out of bed, glad to do anything,
and grabbed a couple of my best handker-
chiefs. Babette absently absorbed them.
Then I spoke to her —she would let me
touch her now. I apologised, I grovelled, I
lied, abjectly I swore that I had never loved,
nor would I ever love, any woman as much
as her. All of no avail. A woman’s tears
must run their course. So I relapsed into
silence; and at last, listening intently, I
heard her sobs subside into sniffs.
There is something solemn in sobs; but
every wife knows there is no tragedy in
sniffs. Babette had sufficient sense to recog-
nise that I was getting critical.
Weakly, in the voice of a sleepy, miser-
able child, she said, “Henry..../ forgot,
too!”
“No!” I insisted, almost hating her for
her collapse.
“I didn’t notice you hadn’t kissed my
neck till after I got into bed. But I knew
there was something worrying me”
“Subconsciously,” I put in.
“Yes,” she said gratefully. “I felt it in
me. I thought of all the things I might
have forgotten, but I couldn’t remember
what it was. And then I remembered, and
it came over me that this was a sign that
we were drifting apart. To think that you
could forget to kiss me, and me forget that
you didn’t! That was the terrible thing.
Of course, you were to blame. If you had
kissed me I wouldn’t have had all that
worry.”
“And all this quarrel” I began in-
dignantly.
“It was because you had made me feel so
ashamed of myself. I simply had to blame
somebody—any woman would.”
“Babette,” I said sternly, “I am going to
kiss you now—right on the nape—five hun-
dred and fifty-nine times. You count!”
“No,” she .said pleadingly. “I know why
you are going to do that. Because you think
you ought to —not because you really want
to. You think it will please me and put me
in a good temper. You think I’m just a
woman, and that all a woman wants is to
be kissed. Never kiss me because you feel
it’s the right thing to do, Henry. I’d simply
hate you if I thought you were only going
to do it to please me. I don’t want that sort
of a kiss. It would be an insult to me.”
“But I want to, want to, want to!” I
exclaimed. “Good God, Babette, if you
could only see your neck as it shows now
from the lace of your nightie, you’d under-
stand that I can’t help kissing it. No man
could.”
“Really and truly?” she wanly smiled.
In a speech of ten minutes’ duration I
convinced her. There was not much credit
to me, however, in that. She was tired
out, and in that comfortable, penitent mood
that comes to every woman after the relief
of a real good cry. She wanted to be
nursed and petted and comforted.
“No,” she smiled, as I bent over her to
start on the 559 kisses, “not to-night,
please!”

That to run a Steam Plant Economically
you must have Dry Steam. The only
efficient method to adopt to ensure your
steam being free from water is to lead
the water with the steam to a proper
collector, and discharge it through a
Steam Trap. But you must have a Trap
that is Reliable and does not Leak.
