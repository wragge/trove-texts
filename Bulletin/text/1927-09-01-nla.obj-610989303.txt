THE MOUTH THE GATEWAY for DISEASE.
Scientists have proved conclusively that no fewer
than 38 different infections may be traced to the
human mouth as a starting point. The mouth thus
being the gateway for the entrance of disease, it
is here that precautions are most necessary.
Hudson’s Eumenthol
Jujubes
Are the most powerful, safe and pleasant Germi-
cide and Antiseptic known. Beine' destructive to
all organisms which give rise to infectious diseases,
they keep the mouth in a sweet, healthy condition.
The Lancet (London) states: —“Their purpose is to
act as a bactericide in the mouth. This result is
likely to be gained, for in the experiments tried
Eumenthol Jujubes proved to be as effective bac-
tericidally a 3 is creosote.”

£1700 Prize Story Competition
This country, rich in short stories, is
suffering and always has suffered from a
great dearth of full-length Australian novels.
The book-stores and -stalls are in conse-
quence overflowing with novels written and
published elsewhere, and too often advertis-
ing some other country.
The Bulletin, which has been respon-
sible for popularising the short story in
Australia, and has created a school of short-
story writers, realises that the time has
come when something should be done for
the long story and the long-story writer.
It therefore announces a competition with
prizes so substantial that it believes the
very best of which Australia is capable will
be forthcoming. A MINIMUM OF £l7OO
WILL BE DISTRIBUTED. The First
Competition will close on June 30, 1928,
at The Bulletin Office, Sydney. Prizes:
First, £500; Second, £125; Third, £75.
Further Competitions will close in 1929 and
1930, the prizes for which will be not less
than £5OO each competition.
The prize stories are to be available for
publication serially in The Bulletin and
the Woman's Mirror; but apart from that
the copyright of every story will be reserved
to the writer, to whom all profits on the
publication of the story in book-form will
belong. It is expected that, as the result of
winning the competition, the prize stories
will have a very large sale in Australia and
Great Britain. Picture rights also will belong
absolutely to the writer. Competitors must
be Australian-born or bona fide resident in
Australia. (Australia, for the purposes of
this paragraph, includes New Zealand and
the Southern Pacific.)
Details with regard to the judges will be
announced later. There will probably be
five, including the Editors of The Bul-
letin and the Woman’s Mirror; and the
A.J.A. (Australian Journalists’ Association)
will be invited to nominate one.
Members of The Bulletin and Woman’s
Mirror staffs will not be eligible to com-
pete.
Every story for competition must be
submitted under a nom de plume; and the
name and address of the writer, with the
nom de plume, must accompany it in a
sealed envelope, which will not be opened
until after the stories have been judged.
Stories submitted for competition must not
have been previously published.
Seasons and Conventions.
In some recent Bulletin verses Arthur
Adams shuddered at the imminent descent
on editors of a horde of spring poems,
though, he says, they at least can happen
only once a year. According to British
tradition, which Australian versifiers mostly
follow with docility, there are four seasons;
and the announcers of them are with us
always. Being a frequent offender of this
kind myself, I am thoroughly qualified to
complain about others.
Are there four seasons in Australia? We
have extremes of heat and cold; but do we
have in plainly marked succession three
months of summer followed by a mournful
dying autumn; a harsh winter with “barren
bush and shrub and leafless tree,” as was
printed the other day; a sudden spring
revivifying the dead earth? Speaking
within my own knowledge of Victoria and
New South Wales, I say no. As far as our
wild vegetation is concerned, spring begins
in March, rises in a long crescendo to a
climax about November, rests—a little—in
the dreamy hottest months; and immedi-
ately starts it all over again.
But a certain period is officially called
winter, and that winter in our bush is very,
very beautiful. It is full of hearty growth
and brilliant color. It gives us a quantity,
of sunshine that astounds visitors from the
Old Country, though it is apt to pass un-
noticed by ourselves. Even in the cities
where the streets are chill and shadowy
wells at the bottom of the skyscrapers, the
flower-boys’ masses of spring blossoms are
one of the first signs that winter is upon
us. Yet so strong is the grip of convention
that when I mentioned something of this
kind lately, my “mistake” was automatically
corrected by a sub-editor who must turn
blind spectacles daily on the evidence as ho
passes to his work.
March is admittedly the last month of
summer, and, I repeat, for all practical
purposes it is the first month of spring,
if spring be, as the dictionary declares, that
season of the year at which plants begin
to spring or grow and flowers to blossom.
It is in March the young grass breaks out
and spreads like emerald flames, wild rose-
mary turns white with tiny stars, and the
golden-guinea bush drops its cheerful yellow
coins in little heaps all round it. One of
the most exquisite of our flora, the correa
or wild fuchsia, with its long-pointed bells
as green as moonlight, is essentially an
early blossom, at its best in March and April.
In winter, too, come the green bottle-brush,
white epacris and the parrot-gay dillwynia.
These and many others have long been
flowering round my home, which is near
the sea. Inland, the hills decked themselves
months ago with acacia discolor, the aptly-
named Sunshine wattle, crimson correa. all
shades of heath, and various eriostemons,
waxy pink and white.
Very few rhymers point out the bush
beauties of these “barren months.” Most
of our winter verses give the impression
that the writers pull down the blinds, stoke
up the. fire and call on the Muse of the
Northern Hemisphere, who dictates the
.-ame mechanical o!d lamentations. Louis
Lavater has dared to write a fine poem on
the joys of winter, part of which runs:—
For those who wander abroad
Shall not be lacking gentle joys by day or
night—
To look upon the heath in bloom,
Acres of blushing ecstasy ;
To catch the breeze-borne fragrance
Of early wattles ;
To which for heath-pink skies at nightfall.
Or when the wind has blown them clear,
To see the star-wrack littering the blue
Like golden wattle-sprays.
Yet even he has not quite shaken off the
shackles, as the last words of the poem
speak of being “ready for the spring,” with
the old suggestion of waiting-waiting, for
what has already happened. How Nature
must smile at us sometimes!
Because the early singers of Australia
(who wrote of the laughter of the mopoke
and the blooms of the magnolia in the
bush) relegated the wattle blossom to the
almanac spring, are we to shut our eyes
for more than half a year beforehand?
Yellow-haired September certainly has A,
pycnantha and A. dealbnta, the favorite
Gold and Silver wattles; but they are late-
comers, stragglers near the end of the
procession which starts as early as February
with A. data, the lovely honey-pale Cedar
wattle. Keeping to personal experience, for
the last few months I have been gathering
in abundance wattles that include A.
armata, A. tongijolia, A. suaveotens and A.
leprosa. Coptarnundra and Normalis are
now leading up to the Golden and Silver,
which will be followed by the Black, whose
clouds of creamy almond fragrance blow
on almost into Christmas. No; spring is
not defined by wattle-blossom.
Disregarding the foreign plants that have
been brought to our streets and gardens, we
have emphatically no sad autumn of decay
and desolation. And with due respect to
many of our poets, I maintain that in
South-Eastern Australia, winter is no
decrepit old man dying in a drab senility;
nor even Louis Lavater’s “blustrous”
Winter, the Male, the Invigorator....
Winter, the Male, the Rebel,
Dark of countenance, and habited in clouds,
With a scourge of lightnings in his hand.
On the heathy slopes along the bay-side,
in the forests of the foot-hills, anywhere
away from walls and roofs and radiators,
we may see our winter as a child-woman,
young, cold, virginal; most joyous. She is
an athlete, swift and vigorous, a kind of
Atalanta before her first dreams of Mil-
anion. Her eyes are rain-grey and austere,
but her cheeks are softly flushed. Her
gown is rain-grey, too, and fringed with
frost, but a magpie warbles on her shoulder,
and her arms are piled with flowers.

Musical Examinations
The London musical journals have been
devoting much space to the question of
musical examinations. The examination
idea seems to be part of the human con-
stitution. The savages of various tribes
admit their youth to full membership after
one or two of the heads have examinee
them both practically and theoretically in
the customs of the people. It is a flattering
thing for both parties, firstly for the ex-
aminer, who deludes himself that his
of inquiry is an adequate method of esti-
mating the candidates’ capabilities, and
secondly for the examinee, who obtains
immense personal gratification from satisfy-
ing the deluded examiner. In music a third
party enters the stage, the teacher. This
individual obtains a very useful and flatter-
ing advertisement from the successes of his
pupils.
Some examinations are of course necessary
It is necessary, for instance, that the State
should insist that those who seek to cure
the illnesses of the people should prove that
they possess a certain amount of knowledge
of their subject. It is necessary that those
who administer the law of the land shoulc
prove their knowledge of it, first of all
These examinations serve a very definite
purpose. The student in medicine and law
does not present himself for examination
for the subconscious purpose of flattering
his own vanity, and ' there is no private
teacher behind the scenes who is reaping an
advertising benefit from the published
results.
Consider the case for the musical exami-
nations. They are in several categories. There
is no fixed standard which will admit one
as an Associate ad eundeni gradum to any
other musical examining body. There is,
worse still, no fixed standard of competence
for the examiners themselves. There is no
State control or even supervision of the
‘‘colleges.” There is nothing to stop any
small body of musical incompetents from
forming a “college” and issuing worthles:-
degrees. There is no protective informa-
tion available to the general public concern-
ing these degrees. The “colleges” are able
to, and actually do, sell their so-called
degrees with the same enthusiasm as an
enterprising merchant sells his own brand of
tea. Of course, some institutions, like the

Nothing like it in the World
With the completion of a four year development and
building programme, Hudson and Essex each present an
entirely new line of bodies and an entirely new chassis
that gives new meaning to motor-car performance.
The Super-Six principle, long held in check, is released
to its full capacity.
That required chassis specially designed to permit full
expression of its wider, more flexible and nimble power.
It meant greater roadability; and a driving and riding ease
not heretofore known. It meant a reliability and sturdiness
that would meet uninterrupted and sustained performance
at top speed for any period of time.
Riding That is Like Flying.
In both Hudson and Essex, you will note at once, and always
remember, an effortless ease in all performance, that can
never be confused with any other car. It is the exclusive
characteristic of the Super-Six principle. Power is so
smoothly delivered in all ranges of performance that you
are scarcely conscious of it. You take the lead at the
getaway, you dart in and around traffic, or you travel all
day at sustained high speed, with only the way you out-
distance others to tell your supremacy. There is no sense
of mechanical effort, no explosive lunge of power, either
m your flashing getaway or in any phase of this flexible
performance.
The bodies are of such variety and beauty as will satisfy
all demands for luxury and exclusiveness as well as comfort
and price advantage.

Branches and Agencies throughout Australia and New Zealand.
Royal Academy of Music, are above sus-
picion. Others, one of them very promi-
nent in Australia, are as worthless as they
are notorious. They issue their hilarious
“degrees” to over 80 per cent, of those who
submit themselves for “examination.” They
permit the foolish deluded ones to place
a few attractive but utterly valueless letters
after their names and to wear a cap and
gown. One enters comparatively few homes
without seeing somewhere a photograph of
a member of the' family wearing a cap
and gown. Cui bono? The visitor is then
probably introduced to the alleged prodigy
of the portrait, who, on being asked to
oblige with a pianoforte solo, either mur-
murs something about being out of practice
or sits down and murders “Rustle of
Spring.”
It is these institutions that have lately
been attracting attention in the English
press. The velvet gloves have been left at
home and certain of the worst offenders
have been individually cited as musical
immoralists. They have been charged with
being pure money-making concerns which
ladle out “degrees” in return for the fees
paid. One of this variety of “college” has
a firm hold in Australia, and it is a very
poor performer who fails to collect its
Associateship. The performer, be he
amongst this year’s failures, can console
himself with the thought that he will
assuredly be with the more fortunate at
his next attempt.
An even more important question than
the status of musical colleges is the perti-
nent one concerning the necessity for hold-
ing any examinations in music other than a
State-controlled one for the granting of a
teacher’s diploma. What is the use of giv-
ing a child half a dozen set pieces at which
he is driven to toil many months in
advance of a given examination? What, is
the sense in making him play these six—
and no others —for months on end? From
the aesthetic side, could anything be more
deadening than the endless repetition of a
set half-dozen pieces? Possibly it is of
some use in spurring the pupil on, but if
his love for music can only be flayed into
activity by the spectre of an impending
examination, it is a waste of valuable time
trying to teach him. It is easy to see what
value the public really places on these
musical degrees. It flocks in crowds to
the Town Hall despite the fact that Heifetz
cannot boast an A.Z.C.M. or Paderewski
a cap and gown.
I have been told by music teachers of
standing in this country and elsewhere that
no one would be more grateful than them-
selves to see a sweeping extermination of
the examination bunyip. They assert that
it interferes with the normal musical develop-
ment of the pupil. “But,” they one and all
ask plaintively, “if the man next door
advertises his examination successes far and
wide, what are you to do?” The only thing
to do is to form a combination of better-
class teachers who will be brave enough to
dispense .with all examinations except a
standard teacher’s diploma.
KEITH BARRY.
Benjamin and Franklin Kidd
Dr. Franklin Kidd, of the Cambridge Low
Temperature Station, at present in Aus-
tralia with his wife, a trained mycologist,
investigating cool storage and transport
problems by invitation of the Common-
wealth Council of Scientific and Industrial
Research, is a son of the Benjamin whose
“Social Evolution,” “Principles of Western
Civilisation” and “The Science of Power”
made considerable stir in evolutionary and
sociological circles at intervals during the
last 30 years. A posthumous book, “A
Philosopher with Nature,” which contains
some “nature studies” of extraordinary
beauty, was edited and brought out by
Dr. Kidd, who also had a lot to do with
getting out “The Science of Power,” most
of which was written before the war but
not published till 1918.
Great hopes of this book were enter-
tained by its author, who regarded it as
the first formulated statement of the evo-
lutionary principle of society as opposed to
that of the individual. He may be said
to have been the Tolstoy of Western
science, for as Tolstoy, a supreme artist,
found in the original teachings of Chris-
tianity (as laid down in the sayings of
Jesus) , the corrective of the falsities of
art and institutional religion, so Kidd
found in them the principles determining
lihe evolution of society as against that of
the individual; and as Tolstoy found in the
loaders of science a hopeless confusion of
thought, so Kidd was more than half-
prepared to endorse the pronouncement of
P. Ramanathan, sometime Solicitor-General
of Ceylon, that “Western science is. ignorant
knowledge.”
“Darwinism,” says Benjamin Kidd, “is
essentially the science of the integration of
the individual efficient in his own interests,”
and he quotes with approval Bagehot’s
“brief and vivid summary” of the Dar-
winian doctrine: “If A was able to kill B
before B killed A, then A survived. And
the race became a race of As, inheriting A’s
qualities.” The doctrine coincided with the
inheritance of pagan ideas with which
Christianity for 1900 years had waged
unequal conflict, and it had a tremendous
influence, changing the whole current of
Western thought. In place of the belief
that the predestined end of humanity is a
universal peace, and that war is a regret-
table and preventible accident, was insti-
tuted the belief that war and the pre-
paration for war and not peace is man’s
normal state of existence. Out of such a
belief, held in greater or less degree by all
the European peoples, the world war natu-
rally and inevitably arose.
Kidd believed that the greatest result of
the war would be to rid Western civilisation
of this obsession. Against the Darwinian
theory of individual evolution depending on
the survival of the strongest and most
ruthless, he postulated a theory of social
evolution resting not on the assertion of
force but on self-sacrifice and renunciation.
“Power in civilisation,” he said, “rests on
collective emotion,” and neither on force
nor reason.
As a matter of fact, Kidd contends, the
part played by heredity in the evolution of
the individual as against that of its social
environment has been grossly overesti-
mated by the Darwinian school, and in
social evolution “the heredity with which
civilisation is supremely concerned is not
that which is inborn in the individual. It
is the social inheritance which constitutes
the dominant factor in human, progress,” a
kind of heredity subject to laws far other
than those by which the fighting male, has
been evolved. As already indicated, it is
not on reason but on the capacity for
emotion that social efficiency depends, and
“there is not an existing institution in the
world of civilised humanity which cannot
be profoundly modified or altered or
abolished in a generation There is no
ideal in conformity with the principles of
civilisation dreamed of by any dreamer or
idealist which cannot be realised within the
lifetime of those around him.” We are not
yet civilised. What we call civilisation is
as yet scarcely more than “glorified sav-
agery.” But if we so will it, we may attain
a true civilisation in our own time.
Darwinism is the science of the evolution
of the individual, of which the keynote is
force, the capacity of A to kill B before B
kills A. It is not the science of the evolu-
tion of society. “The mechanism of inborn
heredity is in the individual; (lie mech-
anism of social heredity is outside of the
individual,” and the supreme type of the
future is not the fighting male but the self-
sacrificing female to whom, as Schopenhauer
complained, the race is always more than
the individual.
“The emotion of the ideal” is the-chief
human organ of the science of Power, and
the means by which, if we will it, the
world may be rapidly transformed for the
better. “Power in its highest expression is
the science of organising the individual
mind in the service of the universal.” Ger-
many showed what could be done by
organising the individual mind in the ser-
vice of war. What nation will first, show
what can be done by organising it in the
service of humanity? “Give us the young,”
cries Kidd, “and we will create a new mind
and a new earth in a single generation.”

Novels Worth Reading
This list has been compiled by a com-
mittee of judges nominated by the Associ-
ated Booksellers of Australia and Maori-
land. It is issued to serve as a reliable
guide to fiction of merit:—
Books of Literary Merit. —The Portrait
of Claire, by Francis Brett Young; Pilgrims,
by Ethel Mannin; The Return of Don
Quixote, by G. K. Chesterton; Absolute at
Large, by Karel Capek; Rogues and Vaga-
bonds, by C. Mackenzie.

don ; The Feathered Serpent, by Edgar

Chase, by R. W. Chambers; The Black
Camel, by Thora Stawell; The Romance of
Nikko Cheyne, by Roland Pertwee; Now
East, Now West, by Susan Ertz; Three
Ships in Azure, by Irwin Anthony.
A Satchel of Books
Flying Clues, by Charles J. Dutton (John
Lane). An exciting detective story.
Men Are Pigs, by Bueno de Mesquita
(Cecil Palmer). A little book of more or
less smart aphorisms in which woman hits
back on behalf of her sex.
Blue Magic, by Roy- Devereux (Crosby
Lockwood; Robertson and Mullens). The
sheik theme presented in an unusual garb.
Everybody writes letters to everybody else
and the author miraculously recovers the lot.
A not inartistic achievement epistolatory
drama.
The Spindrift of Youth, by Lawrence
David (Parsons; Robertson and Mullens).
Hailed as a new Conrad, this writer reveals
nothing as yet but the ability to write a
good stirring sea-yarn without much depth
of character-drawing or philosophic insight.
But quite readable.
Beethoven’s Pianoforte Sonatas, by Wil-
liam Behrend (Dent). The centenary year
has produced a harvest of Beethoven litera-
ture. The object of this well-known Danish
author is to assist in restoring to the living
work its pathetic power and its compelling
savor.
A Londoner’s Own London, by Charles G.
Harper (Cecil Palmer). The queer out-of-
the-way things the author knows and the
quaint trifles that have interested him in a
■London that is rapidly changing. For such
as know and love the vast city the book
will fill many a happy hour. Illustrated by
the author’s own sketches.
Masters of War, by Neville D’Esterre
(Allen and Unwin). Three essays, “Mas-
ters of War,” “Israel in Egypt” and “A
Dissertation on England and the English,”
are designed to serve as stepping-stones to
the study of history. In the first Mr.
D’Esterre skilfully uses his materials with the
object of freeing militarism from its romantic
setting and stating its stark, ugly facts; in
the second he endeavors to reconcile the
Hebrew chronicles of the Pentateuch with
such historical facts as are at our disposal;
the last deals principally with English local
nomenclature and as a study of place names
is of chief interest to philologists.
The Sun of the Dead, by Ivan Shmelov
(Dent). The translation of a novel by a
Russian author. Who reads it sups horror.
It is a realistic story of life in the Crimea
after the withdrawal of the remnant of
Wrangel’s army and the restoration of the
Bolshevik terror. Interspersed are vignettes
of scenery, the beauty of which is in dazzling
contrast to the sombre narrative. Discursive,
as all Russian novels are, but powerful.
Edmund Burke, by Bertram Newman
(Bell and Sons). In addition to giving the
main facts of Burke’s life, the author has
tried to give the substance of his most impor-
tant utterances, so far as possible in his
own words. The American breakaway, the
impeachment of Warren Hastings and the
French revolution necessarily occupy much
space, but within a reasonable compass the
author succeeds in presenting a graphic and
intimate picture of a life that filled and still
fills a large place in English rhetoric and
literature.
Old English Mills and Inns, by E. Thurs-
ton Hopkins (Cecil Palmer). The book is
the outcome of many years’ tramping of the
English countryside, and its writer has a
keen eye for the picturesque and a sharp
nose for the romantic. There are stories of
eccentric characters; of ghostly, deserted
mills; of millponds associated with tragedy;
and a chapter is given to drinking songs
Beneath this stone lies old Join. Trout,
Who left this world from the pains of gout;
On the bitter bier was John borne to the
earth so cold.
Ilis mournful friends murmured “Alas, our
poor brother,
Nevermore we’ll bear his voice say ‘Come
have another.’”
The New Colonial Policy, by Hclmer Key
(Methuen). The author is a distinguished
Swedish publicist of whose earlier work,
“European Bankruptcy and Emigration,” the
present volume is a continuation, bringing up
to date that account of the world’s position,
The remedy for our present complications
arising from the immense indebtedness of the
nations and from the impoverishing effects
of the World War can, in the author’s opinion,
only be found in inventions and in tlie_ pio-
neer activity capable of exploring new ideas
of world-wide economic importance. He sees
in modern enterprise the only means by
which the civilised races can possibly escape
from their present economic confusion. I on-
tical democracy has shown itself incapable
and capitalism seems to be the only way ot
escape.

Bios) . A handsomely produced volume ot
travel m Peru. The land of the Inca. i.
flora and fauna of its jungles and its moun-
tain Deaks. The vampire, we learn, mci-
dentally is not a mythical creature but a
real one’. “The only sound from outside the
house ” says the author in a glimpse of the
jungle, “came from the bats which screamed
like demons. They wmuld circle round tlie
house and then swoop up across the an .d

Costume and Fashion, by Herbert Norris
/p> ent ) Volume II of this handsomely and
profusely illustrated work covers the period
jo(>6-1485. “Changes in fashion,” remarks
t j ie author, “arise from strange and diverse
causes: sometimes a vanquished foe revenges
himself by revolutionising the dress of his
conquerors, or of their wives; sometimes a
w him or deformity of empress or courtesan
imprints its seal on the mode of the century;
a g a i n , the arrival of some new royal consort
or gre at nobility from afar brings its train
0 f consequences either to enrich or simplify
nation’s dress.” In studying the cos-
tumes of a period it is not sufficient to know
the cut, shape and decoration of each gar-
ment; one must also know the manner of
wearing and the general effect aimed at by
the wearer. vVith this in view, much inter-
esting information on such points is inter-
woven with the descriptive text. The author
does no t confine himself to the merely tech-
njca j s i de his subject, but sets it against
picturesque historical background. A
va | ua hi e and an admirably compiled book.
The Harvest of the Years by Luther Bur-
bank with Wilbur Hall (Houghton Mifflin ,
Angus and Robertson). I found a Japanese
'daisy, small and waxy, a Michaelmas daisy
in England that was large and showy but of
poor color, and the little New England daisy,
which was sturdy and a profuse bearer,
Nature had made these variations of the
original daisy possible; I used Nature’s own
methods to re-combine those three heredities.
The result was seed from which there came
an infinite variety of daisies.... By seiec-
tion I eliminated the undesirable plants find
by careful cultivation I began to get more
and more daisies, from the two or three first
successful combinations that came true from
seed w ith the waxy whiteness of the Jap-
anegc, the size of the English daisy and £ the
s turdiness and productivity of the one that, I
had known as a boy in Massachusetts. |By

The stout, double sole of this
Abbey Boot yet is so supple and so
carefully built-up that it has a
softer, cushioning effect. It eases
the roughest going, withstands the
hardest wear.
The upper is lined throughout
with soft leather. Its design elimi-
nates all tightness at the instep by
a slight arching where the boot
laces. It is cut lower at the back—
to fit the ankle snugly—and is
neatly shaped so that it grips the
heel and prevents chafing.

tion of durability ani good looks in

Most people think of the carpet
sweeper as a box* four wheels and a
brush but there is a decided differ-
ence in sweepers.
For 50 years Bissell Carpet Sweepers
have by sheer merit alone maintained
their international reputation for su-
perior mechanical construction and
handy, quiet, thorough sweeping. Only
a tremendous production yearly in the
world’s largest carpet sweeper works
permits its quality at the price.
Millions of users have recognized
Bissell’s marked superiority. No other
sweeper equals it because it alone has
the famous “Cyco” ball bearings, one
set for each wheel where they do the
most good, make the sweeper easier
running, give greater brush propelling
power and automatically take up wear.
Little Bissells for little girls at trifling cost
make lovely gifts and happy children. Sold
by leading merchants everywhere. Write for

Unfettered.
I would be kin to the winds that blow
If mine were the right to choose
\\ hither my wandering soul should go
When Death had set it loose;
For the winds blow out and the winds blow
in
Where never a foot has trod;
They touch with their skirts the streets of
sin
As they blow to the throne of God.
I would be sib to the stars as well,
For the stars are always true,
And so would I learn what the still stars
tell
A* s th ?y shine the long night through
Where time doesn’t matter and distance dies
And peace is everywhere....
Do they know how the millions lift their
eyes
In their faith that their God is there?
Travelling out with the kind old winds
That blow to the farthest stars,
I would be free of the tie that binds
And the fetter of time that mars.
Never a check would there be, or stay,
No quickening spur or thong,
Near at hand or far away,
Only the old wind’s song.
gome would be down by the sunlit sea
And some on the mountain peak,
If they had the choice where their souls
should be
When Death has paled the cheek;
And some in a sheltered, crowded place
Where the harps of angels play,
But I would go out with the winds that race
Away, away, away!

The Wandering Foot.
We saw Tahiti in our wake,
We passed by Puget Sound;
\\ e watched the waves of Torres break
And answered, out and round,
Unto the call of them who take
For aye the outward bound.
A wand’ring foot, the Celts contend,
Though yet a man grow old,
Will itch for roaming to the end:
Nor peace their sons shall hold
Whoso fathers where the rainbows bend
Have sought the crock of gold.
By books bemused some men have been,
And some by women’s smiles;
But oh! and oh! the stars that sheen
Along the moving miles!
And oh! the fairways blue and green
Unto the Blessed Isles!
We see the Straits of Sunda shine,
We watch the Arctic light;
Around the Horn, across the Line,
Our ships pass in the night;
Our ships of rosewood, carven fine,
With sails of damask white.
Yea, pilgrims of unrest, we toil
The desert and the snow,
Each pining for the wine and oil
That somewhere surely flow,
Each seeking for a secret spoil,
Far hid where none may go.
The undines and the mermaids sing
The songs of our desire;
The phoenix who unloved doth bring
Her body to the fire;
And Circe and the sprites that winsr
The magic coasts of Tyre.
Unto their siren music he
Hath listened unawares
Who now by land, and then by sea,
Thus half-contented fares;
Nor knoweth what his quest may be,
Nor very greatly cares.
It may be as the Irish say
That, where the rainbows bend
O’er green Hy-Brasil, far away.
With broken dreams to mend,
The wandering feet will come some day,
Their quest be at an end.

Song in Spring.
Oh, I should have been grieving, and I
should have been sad,
And sighed because, beloved, you turned
away from me;
But all the little leaves danced, and all the
birds were glad,
And there was laughter rippling in the
gay waves of the sea.
Oh, I should have grown pale then, and
gone with grieving heart,
As maidens do forsaken, but, oh, the
morning blue
Was made for lilting laughter—l should
have wept apart,
But (oh, may Cupid pardon!) I thought
no more of you.
Oh, I should have gone sadly, but carolling
the Spring
Came with the azure morning, and all
the boughs were lit
With rose- and lilac-blossom, frail blossom
glimmering,
And I could not be sorry—and that was
all of it!

Winter Night.—Andante.
To-night I want the splendor of old things—
The scent of summer in old Rhenish
wine;
The soft, slow sobbing of some muted
strings,
And long-lost books, that were old friends
of mine.
To-night I want a road that runs to Rome
And distant empires where old Time has
trod;
To-night the tramp of armies coming home
With incense burning to a pagan god!
To-night I sail with Cortez out of Spain,
With eyes that gaze beyond the setting
sun;
To-night I want a world grown young again
When gamblers gambled all, and lost, and
won.

Poppies in Lorraine.
Poppy-plumes are waving in the fields of far
Lorraine,
Scarlet plumes that beckon me, but beckon me
in vain.
Oh, to go in answer to the deep, insistent
cail,
Thrilling to all wonder that has held the
world in thrall!
Death’s nepenthe soon will steal all beauty
from my eyes,
Light of sun or misted moon; though dream-
ing Ronda lies
Clinging to her canyon cleft by silver river-
blade ;
Fretted Moorish arches still destructive Time
evade. .
Light of sun or misted moon will glow no
more for me,
Beauty of the world shut out by Death’s
opacity.
Oh, to stand, before I pass, on Athens’ brood-
ing hill
Where fond fingers of the sun caress the
columns still.
Long-set suns again would light each silent
marble fane,
Trireme oar-slaves see the dawn-white won-
der once again.
Skies star-scintillant are caught on Brusa’s
minarets,
Echoes ring to fortress heights in cobbled
streets of Metz.
Oh, to follow round the world the call of
heart’s desire,
Glimpse the symmetry supreme of Antwerp’s
tallest spire!
Oh, to follow round the world, pluck poppies
in Lorraine;
Then the restful peace of home, the peaca of
home again!
Burdensome the daily round, the little daily
things
Veto vagabond desire, denying me my wings;
But if I should seek afar the poppies in
Lorraine,
Heart of mine, the peace of home would
call me back again!

Forgetting All.
Would you holidaying go
For a week or two,
Casting worry to the winds
As ’twere wise to do?
Peace and solace you shall find,
Far from street and alley,
Where the Wollondilly flows
Through its verdant valley.
Walled by mighty mountain walls
There, with mind amazed,
You will quite forget, my friend,
Walls by builders raised ;
Wonder shall take hold of you
As with gaze uplifted
You behold them ranging far.
Massive, scarred and rifted.
Morn shall be a joy to you,
Noon a golden swoon, •
Wherein you shall dream fine dreams,
And through afternoon,
As you climb the valley-side—
Pausing, praising, panting—
Mighty shadows you shall see,
Shadows blue and slanting.
Kindly winds daylong shall broom,
As you wander there,
All the cobwebs from your brain
Spun by Spider Care;
Free of them, you shall behold
Life renewed and splendid—
Seeing beauty everywhere,
Soul and body mended.
Though afar from town you be,
Far from city folks.
Goodly company you’ll find
In the river-oaks.
Ripples singing on their way,
Oaks beside them singing,
Ripples shining in the sun.
Oaks rich gloom down-flinging.
Beautiful shall be your hours,
Sweet shall be your rest,
As you watch the fallen leaves
On the river’s breast.
As you wateb the fallen leaves
Drifting willy-nilly,
To-and-fro and liere-and-there,
On the Wollondilly.

because all the refinements of the highest-grade special target arms are
built into its barrel and °nti o n The ™ci~ az j ne> which is tuirved in shape and of
entirely new design, brings each of its five .22 Long-Rifle cartridges exactly into line with the
breech when the bolt is pulled back. Double Extractors grip the rim of the shell as it rises from
the magazine, and holding it nrmiy reed it in a perfectly straight line into the close-fitting
chamber.
When the breech is closed the Bullet is seated rio'ht into the grooves of the rifling, ready to
take its spinning flight the instant the trigger is pressed. This means that there is no pre-
liminary “jump” as it leaves the mouth or the shell, and the oore being completely sealed, every
ounce of pressure is exerted against the base of the bullet. The result is superb accuracy, and
the full energy of the particular cartridge used.
These Special Features Are Found in No Other .22 Sporting Rifle.

Information Sought.
(1) Has the .V.N.iP. Education Depart-
ment a correspondence system for the benefit
of bush children? (2) Does the Government
allow anything to the parent or teacher who
instructs these children at home? — l242.
(1) Yes. Children between 7 and 15 are
entitled to such instruction up to the sixth-
class standard, and are supplied with station-
ery and certain necessary books free. (2)
The department does not pay any subsidy
to supervisors of correspondence-lesson
sheets. The only subsidies that are paid are
those for conveyance, boarding and aid to
private teachers in subsidised schools.
How many skins of new-born calves are
necessary to make a i()-ineh coat? Is it
very difficult to tan these skins. — 1250.
(1) Three, if very young. Select largest
for the back, next for the two half-fronts,
and smallest for sleeves, etc. (2) In remov-
ing the flesh and fat use no sodium, as this
hardens the fibres of the skin. Soak in clean
cold water for 24 hours, and over a convex
surface scrape the back of the skin very
carefully with a blunt instrument. Tanning
liquor: 31b. finely-chopped or ground bark
(South Aus. wattle is best), 4oz. powdered
alum, 2oz. borax, 10 gallons water; pre-
pare in a wooden cask. Put skins in
separately, and completely cover with the
liquor for seven days. Every day, or oftener,
the skins should be moved about —top skin
to bottom and so on. The next liquor is to
be slightly stronger—(ilb. bark, alum and
borax the same. Before putting skins in
again scrape. The same handling as in
first week. The third liquor is for only two
flays, and is much stronger. Use 201 b. bark,
2lb. common salt and just sufficient water
to cover the skins. During the first day give
the skins four or five handlings, and none at
all the second day; then take out and wash
four or five times, until the smell of the bark
is quite gone. Dry slowly in a cool,
draughty place. The length of the skin
from the shoulder to the base of the tail will
determine the size of coat it will cut. Very
small skins are not so desirable, as they
will require joins across the back and front.
Can payment under any insurance policy
be collected before probate is granted? —
1210.
This inquirer writes from Tasmania and
if he is domiciled there any policy he effects
would be subject to Tasmanian law. For a
policy not exceeding £250 (exclusive of
bonuses) issued in the ordinary way payable
to the executor or administrator of any de-
ceased person, an office without requiring
probate or letters of administration may pay
the moneys together with any bonuses to the
“husband, wife, father, mother, child, brother,
sister or nephew” of the deceased person who
can prove to the satisfaction of the company
that he or she is entitled thereto under the
will (if any) or under the statutes for the
distribution of the property of intestates
(Life Assurance Companies Act 1915). If
the parties interested prefer the policy may
be effected under the Married Women’s Pro-
perty Act, 1883, section 11 of which pro-
vides that “a married woman may....effect
a policy on....the life of her husband,”
in which case the sum assured would be
payable to the widow without the necessity
of her taking out probate or letters of
administration. If the wife survived she
would draw the money on proof of death;
if she predeceased, probate or letters of
administration in her estate would be re-
quired. Again, the M.L.C. and probably
others issue policies for amounts up to £3OO
payable to the deceased’s executors or
administrators or, at the option of the co.,
to the wife or husband or any relative by
blood or lawful beneficiary or connection by
marriage of the assured. In this case, if
the case be clear and there be no will, the
company would undoubtedly exercise the
option of paying the widow, if any; or fail-
ing her any other person within the defi-
nition. The position thus seems to be fairly
well provided for.
How does Melbourne Cup compare with
English Derby for prize money? —l336.
Melbourne Cup is a handicap sweepstake
of £75 each with £lO,OOO added. Second
£2OOO, third £lOOO out of stakes. Derby
is a sweepstake of £lOO each with £3OOO
added. Second collects £4OO, third £2OO, and
the breeder of the winner £5OO.
(1) Where can I sell mica? (2) What
size and quality is payable? —l24B.
(1) There is not a regular Australian mar-
ket. England and the U.S.A. are steady
buyers; but there is a tariff against it in
the U.S.A. (2) Good quality is saleable
down to 2in. by 2in.; that size would be
worth 2s. per lb. London. Sheets lOin. by
Gin. sell for 15s. to 30s. per lb. But there
is very little of that size.
How do ] go about' painting my old Ford?
Can you recommend any paints or enamels?
—1289.
Remove all grease and dirt by a weak
solution of washing-soda and warm water.
When dry sandpaper carefully till all tlje
old gloss is rubbed off. If the old paint
work is chipped fill up w'ith a paste filler
softened with turps, and when dry rub
smooth. Apply all over a coat of undercoat-
ing paint, thinned dowm with pure turpen-
tine and tinted with a little of the enamel
chosen for the final coat. Allow the under-
coating to dry for 24 hours and then
apply the enamel. Flow' it on smoothly and
evenly and do not attempt to work or brush
it out too much. Do not allow the car to
stand in a draught, and work in a room as
free as possible from dirt and dust. The
enamel works more easily on a still, warm
day, and if the car has first been warmed in
the sun. If necessary an extra coat of
enamel can be used after rubbing the gloss
off the previous coat with fine sandpaper.
"Ripolin” Enamel and Berger’s Motor Gloss
Enamel are two good preparations.
Is there a cheap paint to stand three
months in salt sea-water on a wooden boat?
Here at Thursday Island I've used red oxide
and red lead and they last only jour weeks.
—1277.
Broomfield’s Ltd., Sussex-street, Sydney,
recommend Peacock and Buchan’s brown or
red copper paint; 4s. 6d. per 31b. tin.
They can also supply a green anti-fouling
paint in tins at 7s. Gd. per quarr.
Anti-fouling paints will not, however, keep
clean in any waters for more than three
months.
In mixing paint what should the propor-
tions of boiled and raw oil and white-lead
be? How many gallons to give two coats
to a wall 120/f. x lift. How to make a stone
color? —131!).
(1.) For first coat: lewt. of white-lead,
5 to 5* gal. raw linseed oil, Jgal. turps and
igal. terebine. Second coat: Cut the oil
dowji to about 4gal. to lewt. of lead. (2)
First coat, about 281 b. lead, l|gal. raw lin-
seed oil, 1 pint turps and one pint of tere-
bine. Second coat: 281 b. lead, lgal. oil with
h pint turps and I, pint of terebine. (3)
Ochre or sienna stainor, the proportions
necessary being dependent upon depth of
shade.
Our municipal council generates and sells
current. After most house-occupants had
become consumers, the council decided to ask
for £1 deposit to guarantee payment of the
light account, the charge only affecting new
consumers and irrespective of whether the
consumer be a tenant or an owner. (1) Has
the council the power to make tins charge?
(2) Has it the power to charge new con-
sumers and not old? (3) Can it, make this
charge to a tenant and not to an owner? (4)
Is it necessary for the council to ask for
a guarantee—could it not claim against the
property ? —lll6.
(1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) The person
against whom the charge is made is the
person who applied to the council for a
supply of light; that is to say, the person
who signs the agreement as consumer. (4)
The council cannot recover against the
property for electric-light charges.
What does the N.S. IF. Prickly-pear Com-
mission cost the State per annum? What is
it doing?- —1226.
The Act of 1924 provides for five years
from January 1, 1925, an annual £30,000 for
pear destruction. The chairman of the Com-
mission receives £1250 p.a. Up to date only
one report on the activities of the
Commission has ■ been made—for the period
to June 30, 1926. The second report will
be available shortly. The distribution
of poison did not commence until February,
1926. Up to .Tune 30, 1926, 81 tons
of poison had been sold to landowners;
also 67 atomisers, 38 poison guns, pistols
and stabbers. An area of 207,380 acres had
been inspected and classified. The Commis-
sion conducted pest-clearing operations along
the North Coast, at Gravesend and at
Eulah Creek near Narrabri. The Commis-
sion has seriously set out to combat the pest,
but the data is not sufficient to allow of a
judgment of its success or otherwise.
Can sarsaparilla, such as one buys' at
pubs, be made from the plant that grows
in Australia? How is the liquor made? —
1340.
Sarsaparilla is not grown commercially in
Australia (what is known as wild sarsa-
parilla has no value) ; but the prepared plant
is obtainable from wholesale druggists.
There are two beverage preparations, the
beer and the syrup. For the heer: sarsa-
parilla 40z., sassafras -joz., honey |lb..,
sugar lib., yeast 40z., boiling water 1 gal-
lon. Boil the drugs in part of the water, decant
and boil again with more water, and con
tinue until the water is exhausted. Mix the
rest, add the sugar and yeast and enough
water to make 25 gallons, and put in a cask
and allow to ferment. Sarsaparilla syrup:
oil of wintergreen 10 drops, oil of anise
10 drops, oil of sassafras 10 drops, fluid ex-
tract of sarsaparilla 20z., simple syrup
(sugar and water) 5 pints, and powdered
extract of liquorice 4oz. Mix well.
How can ] treat springs, swampy country
and' waterholes with bluestone for fluke? —
1253.
A spray pump should be obtained and a
solution of 1 per cent, bluestone, which is
approximately two teaspoonfuls to a gallon,
sprayed all over. Stock should be kept off
for about eight days. Where this plan is
impracticable the bluestone could be placed
in a bag at the head of the spring where it
will dissolve out and flow over the pastures.
With regard to waterholes, it is difficult to
estimate cubic capacity, but a tank 10ft. by
10ft. by 64ft. would hold approximately 4000
gallons, to which 41b. of bluestone should
be added. These solutions are so weak that
they are not likely to cause poisoning of the
stock.
How and when docs a girl obtain employ-
ment during the N. S. Wales fruit-picking
season? —l297.
Employment for girls during the N.S.W.
fruit season is almost exclusively confined
to work in the canning factory at Leeton ;
there is generally sufficient local labor for
picking purposes. Apply Manageress.

blady-grass. though it may take some years
to do it. Banana-growers give it three or
four clappings—that’s usually sufficient.

word Wooragee—the name of my birthplace,
a small farming settlement midway between
Beechworth and Yackandandah (Vic.).
When I thought of Wooragee as the name
of my present residence, I consulted an auth-
ority, Mr. Kenyon, of the State Rivers
Department, and from the information he
furnished I was satisfied that it meant
“Eating place” or “Place where I eat.” I
regarded this as most appropriate and accord-
ingly adopted it. Wooragee, I should add,
contained trees which yielded manna; I re-
member gathering this sweet stuff as a boy.—

OLD KING CANUTE IN THE ARBI-
TRATION COURT.
The International Labor Office at Geneva
is an institution which lives on industrial
statistics, and having the information of
the world at its disposal its statements
command some respect. It lately reported
that the average adult wage in the United
States is now £253 per annum, which is of
interest inasmuch as the average Aus-
tralian factory wage was recently stated as
£193 per annum. The Labor Office further
reported that during a period in which the
average Yankee wage increased by about
110 per cent, the cost of living rose by only
31 per cent. That is different from the
experience of Australia, where the cost of
living sprints up as fast as, or faster than,
wages, so that the industrial end is at least
as bad as the industrial beginning. A fre-
quent explanation is the habit of making
less work go along with more money.
When there are only 11 units of produc-
tion to supply larger wages where there were
formerly 12 units to snpply smaller wages,
it is obvious that the price of' articles,
which is the cost of living, must rise the
faster of the two. This simple proposition
is less understood than might be expected.
Two outstanding historical figures are
Canute Sweynsson (a.d. 1027) ordering
the tide not to rise and thus keep pace
with the moon, and Canute Piddington
(a.d. 1927) announcing that the cost ol
living would not rise and thus keep pace
with the award. The chief difference
between them is that the first was a wise
man in jest while the second is an unwise
man in earnest.
* :|: * *
Interested parties, Red and other tints,
enter violent protest against the assertion
that the United States workman, under the
regime of profit-sharing, piece-work and
other devices which union bosses here order
their subjects to hold accursed, is better
off financially than his much-arbitrated,
strike-haunted, day-labor, stop-work brother
on this side of the Pacific. A mass of
evidence says that he is better off, even
though last census showed 13 per cent, of
the U.S. population to consist of imported
aliens, many of them ill-educated and
unpromising, while another 10 per cent,
were colored folk of African descent. A
positive certainty, which stands out with-
out any need to send over caravans to
discover, is that the U.S. toiler can be
much better off financially, even if he isn’t
so yet, the means to make him so being
available. Furthermore, wages in the
Republic have a very fair prospect of
rising higher, while those in the Common-
wealth have a very large prospect of falling
lower. In a recent year the Republic
exported £160,000,000 worth more than it
imported, invested a good deal of this
abroad, and proceeded to enjoy the income
from the investment. In the same year
the Commonwealth imported £21,000,000
worth more than it exported, added that
sum as well as the year’s interest to its
foreign debt, and started to pay interest
on the lot in addition to the interest it
was paying already. The United States is
in a unique position. (1) Its own debt,
which is about £1,500,000,000 less than at
the close of the war, is held by, and the
interest is paid to, local people. (2) The
Government has between £2,000,000,000 and
£3,000,000.000 due to it by 20 foreign
States, and it has had successes in the way
of collection which make Britain’s efforts
look quite inferior. A Government which
extracted principal and interest in full
from Cuba, which has nearly accomplished
the same feat with Nicaragua and has
screwed payments out of Hungary and
Liberia is no poor collector. And (3) the
investments of private Yankees abroad,
including the Australian bonds which are
being sold by the cartload, are a vast but
indefinite source of revenue. The essential
reason why the Yankee, whatever he may
be paid now, has a prospect of better things
is that the money (the country’s own
money) is there and the accumulation is
always growing. The essential reason why
the Australian has no permanent and reli-
able prospect of the sort is that the money
(the country’s own money) isn’t here, and
the liability is always growing.
* * * #
The State liabilities, which are wholly
apart from war expenses of any kind, divide
conveniently into two fairly equal sections
—before June, 1914, and from then to June,
1926, later and worse figures not being
available. They read like this: —
Debt at
End of First Added during
Period (about Second Period
59 years). (12 years).
New South Wales .. £116,695,031 £106,809,740
Victoria . . . . 66,130,726 74,134,263
Queensland . . .. 54,523,506 47,793,360
South Australia .. 33,564,332 47,909,292
Westralia . . . - 34,420,181 36,386,740
Tasmania , . . . 12,265,012 12,212,578
It was a remarkable dozen years in which
three State debts more than doubled and
three nearly doubled. The dazzling and
intoxicated performance can’t be repeated
on the familiar lines, for if South Australia
more than doubled its debt in order to pay
interest, and keep the tawdry and dubious
glories of its boom still in evidence, some-
body must needs lend it about £105,000,000
in the next 12 years, and nobody will. The
wage rate of Australia has increased, but
not. so much as that of the United States,
and the cost of living has risen more than
that of the United States, assuming that
the purveyors of official figures know their
business, which they probably do. And as
the person who collects the interest on a
vast mortgage to supplement his earnings
must be on a better wicket than the one
who pays the interest out of his earnings,
the position is only natural. Piddingtons
and others of the Canute breed may
arrange for results to be different, but all
their arrangements won’t make them
different.
HOW TO REDUCE TAXES.
The Bruce-Page Government will probably
yield to the agitation for lower rates of
income-tax. It is a yielding sort of Govern-
ment. Whether the agitators will get any
enduring relief from the expected reductions
is another question. That will depend upon
the State Governments, and the history of
their manoeuvres is not encouraging.
When the Bruce-Pages abandoned their
tax on entertainments where the charge
was less than 2s. 6d., the Westralian Gov-
ernment weighed in with a tax on admis-
sions costing between 9d. and 2s. sid. Cuts
in the Commonwealth income-tax have
also been followed by the raising of the
State imposts, particularly in N. S. Wales
and South Aus. N.S.W. Premier Lang
increased the tax on company profits irom
2s. 6d. to 3s. in the £. and individual tax-
payers were correspondingly smitten. The
Westralian and Tasmanian Treasurers are
receiving substantial grants from the Com-
monwealth, and while these continue they
are not likely to bump up their income-
taxes. Westralia’s Collier, in fact, has
recently used £200,000 of Commonwealth
money for tax-reduction (and electioneer-
ing) purposes. But those who imagine
there is no danger of the other four Trea-
surers reimposing the taxation they expect
the Bruce-Pages to drop are optimists.
Three of the four confess to being fear-
fully hard up; and Lang is the other
gentleman.
* £ fit *
The important fact which the tax-reduc-
tion campaigners ignore is that the State
Governments arc borrowing hugely in dear
markets (through the Commonwealth Loan
Council unfortunately) for all sorts of un-
payable undertakings and resorting to their
income-taxes to meet the soaring interest
bills. Some of them are also using their
income-taxes to provide all manner of con-
cessions for their clients at the expense of
their opponents. So long as these practices
continue the income-taxpayer will be over-
burdened, however the Bruce-Pages may
try to lighten the load. His outlook would
be brighter if taxation of incomes were
made exclusively a Federal matter. Were
this done the income-tax could be reserved
for payment of war-debt interest and sink-
ing fund and the war-pensions account, being
reduced as they were reduced, instead of
being recklessly abused and squandered by
thp breed of State borrowers and vote-
buyers. By way of consideration, the Com-
monwealth might give up taxing enter-
tainments and land values 1 fear of
the farmer’s vote would be a check on
State extortion there); also, it could take
over a considerable portion of the State
debts, especially those on which the interest
is free of State income-tax. With the
'per capita money to negotiate with, the
Bruce-Pages are in a position to bring
all these reforms about. If they cared to
use the power the control of these millions
gives them they could even veto State
borrowing tor Hopeless “works.” But they
are a ,r reat deal too polite for that
# * * *
One Australian income-tax would natur-
ally cost less to collect—a great deal
less—than the seven imposts do. And,
unless there was sad bungling or worse, it
would reach a good many people who now
escape, wholly or partly—investors in the
tax-free loans, for instance fa numerous
body now), seafaring men and others who
never stay long enough in one part of
the Commonwealth to be liable for State
income-tax, and property-owners drawing
rents from two or more States. Under the
present system or lack of system it is
possible for a man who lets houses in
several States to claim exemption from
State tax on income totalling £lOOO, whereas
a neighbor in receipt of a personally-earned
income of £lOOO would have to pay in
State tax £3O or £4O. Moreover, scores
of thousands of bachelors in a much better
financial position than married men who
have to fork out are allowed to go scot-
free. The Commonwealth Government, with
the war to pay for, allows single as well
as married men an exemption of £3OO a
year. J. Bull discriminates—and wisely. The
total exemptions in his country are £135 and
£162 for the single (according to whether the
income is derived from property or personal
exertion) and £225 and £270 for the married.
Where a bachelor can show that he is main-
taining his mother, instead of giving her
£1 a week and taking the rest out to the
races, he is granted a deduction of £6O.
John Bull also imposes a flat rate (4s.
last year) on ordinary incomes and a super-
tax (9d. to 65.; on large incomes. The
Australian taxpayer is warned what to
expect in these thrilling terms:—
Personal exertion: First taxable £l,
3 3-Sood. ; and for every further £1 up to
£7600 inclusive, an increase of 3-SOOd.
obtaining for whole taxable income.
Income from property: First £l, 3
1-181,055 d., increased by 1-181,055 d. for
each additional £1 to £546 inclusive. From
£547 to £2OOO the increment on which the
rate is fixed increases on each additional £1
to 33.600 d. at £2OOO, etc.
The British method is at least simple and
intelligible—a man knows at a glance what
he will have to pay. In Australia crowds
of cursing victims, unable to solve the
department’s conundrums, pass them on to
taxation-agents, thereby, in ' effect, paying
another tax.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Hope That Radiates from Hogan.
An air of mitigated bustle has come over
Victoria by reason of the Hogan Govern-
ment’s assurance that it means business in
the matter of developing two or three
neglected ports, and giving places besides
Melbourne a chance to grow. It is a pity
the idea wasn’t taken up before. Lawson
and the Allancocks almost doubled the
public debt in eight or nine years, largely
in the effort to set people growing things
so far from ports and big towns that the
produce ate itself up on the way to market
When Providence has made a port which
only requires a little improvement, and has
put good. land handy, it seems reasonable
that business should ensue; but such States
as N.S.W. and Victoria evolved the quaint
lunacy that it shouldn’t be allowed to
ensue. The view taken was that every sea
outlet save the one where the overgrown
capital city stands is a curse and a thing to
be repressed.
No white community outside Australia
produced quite so demented an inspiration.
In the effort to stop some new Liverpool
or Cardiff or Hull from making a beginning,
as much money has been spent, directlv
and indirectly, as would have sufficed to
create the place. The losses on absurdly
long and crooked railways, built not so
much to carry trade as to divert it, are
mere items in the account. Victorians
are now beginning to make calculations, and
they discover that in some cases an unob-
trusive new port where deep-sea ships called
might reduce the freight to some big market
by 50 per cent, or more and create a lot
of unearned increment as well. And the
freight matter may make all the difference
to the settler between success and failure.
Whether the Hogan Government will
make a success of its great endeavor or
whether the influence of the Big City
(which held 41 per cent, of the State's
population in 1901, 45 per cent, in 1911,
and has now attained to nearly 56 per
cent.) will push it back into the old groove
remains to be seen. But at least it is trying
to get away from the old foolishness, and is
entitled to a great deal of encouragement.

Is This the Price of Arbitration?
John Bull, although he has been familiar
with the idea for 127 years, has never fallen
in love with compulsory industrial arbitra-
tion. His Industrial Court, established in
1919, can only act if both parties voluntarily
submit to its jurisdiction, and his Par-
liament is still looking carefully at the teeth
of a proposal that the Court’s awards should
be enforceable by law. Large bodies of his
workers—the miners are a case in point—
refuse to have anything to do with either
conciliation or arbitration. .Joint Industrial
Councils, as recommended by Speaker
Whitley’s Committee, operate in many in-
dustries, but their decisions are not always
accepted. Employers can—and often do—
flout, them, and a trades union that thinks
the bargain dictated by the Council is a
bad one for it can do what it likes about
it. There is no such thing as a “basic wage.”
Yet about three million of John Bull’s
wage-earners work fairly peacefully and
contentedly under awards or agreements
that neither they nor their employers need
observe if they think there is some better
’ole to go to.
Australia for several years has been pre-
tending to compulsorily arbitrate its labor
wars, but the pretence grows thinner each
year, and the employers on the one side and
the most militant wing of the Labor move-
ment on the other unite in condemning the
swindle. At the moment, a Commission is
sitting in Sydney to inquire into allegations
reflecting on the impartiality of the man
who fixes wages in the Ma State; that
same man is gravely considering whether
the Railway Commissioners have a right to
suspend employees who had first suspended
themselves, and an Industrial Judge is tinker-
ing with an award that precipitated a strike
in the industry he applied it. to. All over
the country people who are supposed to
have been conciliated and arbitrated are
carrying strike banners, even in States where
“conciliation” tribunals are presided over
by a Labor nominee, ensuring a Labor
majority on any division.
The two gravest defects of the compul-
sory arbitration theory, as J. Bull regards
it, are the difficulty of constituting a tri-
bunal whose impartiality will be above
question, and the futility of any attempt on
the part of the State to deny the wage-
earner the right to knock off work if he
doesn’t like the wages, or the hours, or
the color of the boss’s hair. There is a lot
of reason in John’s objections; but Aus-
tralia can give him another to add to his
collection—the discredit that is cast on all
law and authority by the failure of Arbi-
tration Courts to enforce their awards. No-
thing more serious than that is happening
in Australia to-day; it is doubtful whether
anything more serious could happen. If it
is a feature inseparable from Arbitration
Courts, then the price is too big to pay, and
Arbitration Courts must go.
Two Labor Premiers.
In the space of seven days there have been
two menacing mob demonstrations in Syd-
ney. In one case there was a procession of
dissatisfied unionists, headed by Garden,
the Moscow pilgrim, to the precincts of the
Commonwealth Arbitration Court, where
21 members of a union were about to be
charged with taking part in an illegal strike,
the apparent object being to intimidate the
Judge. In the second instance the same
Garden and other Reds from the Trades
and Labor Council and the A.L.P. execu-
tive, obeying the signal from Moscow to
stir up mob protests against the execution
of Sacco and Vanzetti, collected a crowd of
unionists, who marched through the Sydney
streets, holding up traffic, hurling insults at
workers who refused to join them, and paus-
ing at the cenotaph in Martin-place “to
offer a silent tribute to the dead”—not the
dead Australian soldiers, but the dead
Italian murderers.
While this lawless exhibition was in pro-
gress the mob-Premier was nowhere to be
seen. When several hundred demonstrators.
Government railway employees who had
been dismissed for throwing down their
tools without notice, marched to his office
and demanded to see him, he begged to be
excused as he hadn’t had his lunch! Placed
in a situation in which strength was


demanded, he showed himself the weakling
Peter Loughlin long ago called him. He
was afraid to take part in the demon-
stration, afraid to denounce it, afraid to
face the dismissed railway employees, afraid
to tackle the Commissioners who dismissed
them. With his tail well down he sent for
Piddington, the Industrious Commissioner,
who obligingly agreed to take the trouble
off his hands. Then the mob-Premier hur-
ried away to deliver an election address to
a thousand policemen, who were promised
a rise of 7s. a week as from July 1 and told
they were models of manly beauty, integrity
and intellectuality—“the finest body of men
in the world.”
It is refreshing to turn to the attitude of
another Labor Premier. The man in
Queensland is standing behind his Railway
Commissioner in sacking all railway-
men who refuse to obey orders relative to
South Johnstone sugar-mill traffic, declared
“black” by their Red union bosses.
McCormack is deliberately taking the risk
of another railway strike rather than accept
the Red theory that the union is superior
to the “capitalist” State. He has just come
from a country in which cbwardly surrender
of the authority of Government to arrogant
minorities, persisted in until it became a
habit, ended in a frightful civil war.
*
Group Settlements.
The S. M. Herald (8/8/’27) put a “special
representative” at work to bless the West-
ralian “group” settlement device, but he
rather missed fire. It appears that 4305 settlers
were planted in the course of five years, and
there were 2069 remaining last June. At
least the Government says there were 2069
remaining last June. The Government also
mentions that a further “500 locations” are
to be “reduced” owing to “disappointing
results.” Seemingly, it does not share the
enthusiasm of the Herald man.
The settlements are all in the south-west
corner of the State, fairly close-up to the
capital, so it isn’t exactly a matter of
pioneering the wilderness. The country is,
or was, largely forest, and as the “special”
explained: “The first method of tackling the
clearing work was to fell all the timber,
big and small alike, with the aid of tractors,
and then to burn off as much as possible
of the fallen stuff But even after gelig-
nite was used on the trunks of the big tim-
ber, gigantic logs resisted the fire. The
labor involved in removing them involved
considerable expense, and it became clear
that it was sufficient to ringbark the bigger
stuff and leave it to fall hy itself in the
course of years.” The value of the timber
destroyed isn’t even estimated, but one
item of expense was 10s. per day sustenance
money for the destroyers.
The actual cost of the “group” business
is hard to arrive at. The Government
calculation is that £4,680,000 was spent up
to June 30. During the five years 1922-26
the State debt rose from £49,000,000 to
nearly £71,000,000, while the population of
Perth is estimated to have grown by 22,450,
and that of all the other 975,900 square
miles of Westralia by 12,688, “groups” in-
cluded. Westralia is a rather backward
place for “secondary” industries. It would
be far more advanced had it acted years
ago on the advice given by the late secre-
tary of its great co-operative organisation,
to take advantage of the tariff instead of
inveighing against it. Still during the few
years while the 2069 “group” settlers who
remain were being collected, it added 4023
to its factory employees, many of them
being as prolific fathers of families as their
bucolic brethren. They cost the State
little or nothing to gather, and no forests
were devastated to make room for them;
also they catered for a sure market at the
door, and not for a dubious one a continent
or two away. The Freetrader declares with
intensity that if Protection was abolished
the new and rather nomadic arrival on the
land could be provided with a slightly
cheaper axe with which to ravage the splen-
did timber; but even that is very uncertain.
♦ ■
Lang and the Country.
Inverell affords a good example of how
Lang’s heart bleeds for the country.
Inverell has no water supply, although
£70,000 was voted for one in 1916 and the
first sod was turned with all the pomp and
ceremony Governor Strickland could lend
to it. The war stopped the work, and when
it was proposed to start again H.C.L. and
a few other things sent the estimated
cost up to £157,000. The Works Depart-
ment funked and the water stayed in the
Gwydir River 13 miles away.
Later the department was induced to
look underground for water. A couple of
boreholes discovered it in abundance at
a depth of 350 feet. The water rose to
within 70 feet of the surface and defied a
pump to lower it. To hasten the work of
reticulation, etc., a deputation went to
Sydney in June. It was bad luck for it that
Flannery had just been kicked out and the
£175,000 he had been hanging on to for
country-town water supplies had been com-
mandeered by Lang to help pay the extra
cost of 44 hours on jobs around the city.
Ratcliffe, Flannery's successor, didn’t
know anything about the matter, or if he
did he kept it so carefully concealed that
the deputation began to wonder if the city
had ever heard of such a thing as a
country-town water supply. Then the depu-
tation got into touch with the officers of
the department. They were courtesy itself.
Everything was soon arranged except
finance. The department hadn’t a bean,
and, worse still, was not likely to have any;
the Treasury was empty, . Borrowing from
a private lender would not be permitted;
but if the aldermen would undertake- to
hawk Treasury bonds at 5$ per cent, the
money so raised might be used for the pur-
pose of installing Inverell’s water supply.
The council had barely started bond-
hawking when Lang announced that he had
a surplus of nearly a million and a half!
A few days later the same Croesus
informed the city papers that he was mak-
ing available two millions for the Eastern
Suburbs underground railway, three millions
for electrification of city railways and one
and a half millions for the approaches to
the Harbor Bridge. Yet the Treasury
hadn’t a bean—for the country.

The German Army of Commerce.
To pay the foreigner ultimately £125.000,000
a year and at the same time keep the home
supplied with necessaries looks a tough job;
yet that, since the adoption of the Dawes
plan, is what the German has to face. How
is he doing it?
Before the Great War Germany had with
regard to certain of its industries, such as,
coalmining, iron and steel production and
the manufacture of textiles and chemicals,
a system of centrally-controlled associa-
tions dealing with their productive capa-
city and output. The existence of these
organisations, or cartels, was found to be
of the greatest utility in the machinery of
war. England had to build up their equiv-
alent out of dismembered material. Long
prior to 1914 the German had in a wonder-
ful penetration of outside nations by his
commerce shown a genius for business
organisation. There were few markets in
which he could not adapt his products to
local needs and customs and prejudices.
With the post-war problem before him he
resolved to further extend and tighten up
the organisation of his industries. He had
not only the reparations money to find
but also interest on the loans he had been
obliged to raise for present needs, the
greater part from the U.S.A.
To get back after war to competitive
efficiency called for the overhaul of the
industrial machine. “Germany has,” Hugh
Quigley wrote in “Towards Industrial
Recovery,” “set out on a vast scheme of
regulation, chiefly from within, but also
with the encouragement and advice of the
State.” Though the French occupation of
the Ruhr and the stabilisation of the mark
had operated to adversely affect the trusts
formed during the inflation period, the
central idea of constituting widely embrac-
ing organisations in finance, industry and
commerce had not ceased to occupy the
German mind. The heart of discipline still
beat. The object was “to elaborate a new
form of industrial organisation which would
preserve a high standard of efficiency and
operate on a common policy.” The con-
version of the central associations of firms
in the same group of industries—the car-
tels—into the trust (in effect a more power-
ful form of cartel) was set in operation.
What was aimed at was a vast aggregation
of allied groups of industry with powers of
price-fixing, standardisation in manufac-
ture, discount adjustments, central selling,
marketing and so on.
In iron, steel, chemicals, papers, silk,
linoleum and other large industries for
which a foreign market must be sought
the movement has been strongly in the
direction of this trust or single syndicate,
embracing complete financial, administra-
tive and technical and price control. By
thus knitting together distributed and iso-
lated individuals of the one branch of
industry, unfruitful competition is avoided,
overlapping eliminated and price conflict
excluded. The German’s genius for dis-
cipline, which enabled him for over four
years to resist the pressure of the most
formidable alliance of nations ever brought
together, is now being utilised in a war of
commerce.
And the huge trust systems thus being
built up will be invaluable in any war in
perspective which may be glimpsed through
Fritz’s spectacles. That the dread of this
is not wholly absent from the British mind
is suggested by a recent cablegram. The
combination which holds within it the
extensive chemical production works of
Germany has been directing its great
strength to such objects as “the fixation of
atmospheric nitrogen in the liquefaction of
coal, the manufacture of cheap hydrogen,
artificial silks and the Svoollenisation’ of
cotton.” More recently it has aimed at a
European chemical trust; and there is
anxiety in London lest such an agreement
might tend to give Germany an advantage
in war-time. It is predicted that the next
war —probably to end civilisation —will be
a chemical one. In such an event a huge
trust, such as it contemplates, might con-
ceivably mean a huge victory; for it is not
characteristic of the German’s psychology
to invite neighbors into a scheme out of
which he himself has no prospect beyond a
common profit.

Australia in the Saddle.
It came as a shock to many admiring
Britons to realise during the war that a
great proportion of the Australian soldiers
they met not only knew nothing about
horses but had never ridden one. The rush
to the cities has had its share in eliminating
the type which once made the Australian as
famous among horsemen, as the “Waler”
was among horses. The spread of the
sheep has helped. The vogue of the motor-
car has done even more. Save on the ever-
receding cattle-stations, it is becoming more
and more difficult to find the horse and
rider of this vanishing type.
That is written with reservations, of
course. Very good horsemen—as distin-
guished from trick buckjump and show-ring
riders—are still with us; and a great propor-
tion of them must nowadays be sought in
the ranks of the polo players. The game
has given to many a new reason for acquir-
ing horsemanship. It is also reviving an
interest in the once-renowned Australian
horse-breeding industry. There are, it is
true, comparatively few breeders of polo
ponies in this country as yet, but their pro-
duct has already acquired an international
reputation; the English team from the
Indian army, which will meet the Ameri-
cans this month for the International Cup,
will be largely horsed with Australian
ponies from India.
So This Is America!
“An American rum-runner berths at a New
York wharf. Motor-trucks and cars swoop
down and fill up with liquor valued at
1,000,000 dollars. (Everything outside of
a 10-ccnt store in Noo Yoik seems to be
valued in round millions.) The vessel
dashes for freedom, blunders on to a shoal
and is captured by police, marine patrolmen
and coastguards.”
“A mayoral election is in progress in
Chicago. Thugs and gunmen dart hither
and thither, blow up polling-booths, murder
100 per cent. Americans and fellow thugs
and gunmen who—for a consideration —
are for the opposing candidate. Armored cars
and machine-guns belonging to the factions
make bloody play at strategic points.
Those are two incidents only in the every-
day life of an amazing country. They
are extracted because Al Smith, Governor
of New York, and William Hale Thomp-
son, elected mayor of Chicago more or less
by armed force, are being seriously discussed
as candidates for President of the United
States when Calvin Coolidge lapses back
into obscurity or thereabouts.
It is a pretty possibility: that one of
these may be the head of the greatest re-
public in the world! A republic which
boasts of its advancement in civilisation;
of its monster universities; of its efficient
large-scale industry; of huge skyscrapers;
of a thousand and one best-in-the-world
things. And yet not so amazing. For to
America goes the credit of disarmament
conferences which are insistent on increas-
ing armament; of lynch law for negroes;
of law which weakly surrenders to bomb
outrages and mob sentiment; of political,
judicial and social scandals on a scale in
keeping with its skyscrapers. It seems in-
conceivable that Smith or Thompson will
reach the White House. But should either
be elected at least he will not be markedly
incongruous in that extraordinary hotch-
potch of political and social incongruities
that is the United States.
«
Chipped China.
The Chinese situation looks confused, but
some leading facts stand out. The Russian
emissaries who lighted the fire have mostly
departed lest they should be trodden upon
in the rush, taking with them less loot
than they expected. The war lords and
bandits didn’t leave much for outsiders. The
original notabilities of the shindy, including
Chen, Chang, Ching, Chong, Chung and
Chump, have mostly passed off the stage,
but some of them have been succeeded by
others of the same name. A few of the
absentees are reputed to have taken as much
as two million dollars with them, and other
absentees are said to be in hot pursuit be-
cause they want the money badly them-
selves. Most of them “saved face” by leav-
ing behind them turgid proclamations, the
general effect being that they hadn’t fled in
terror, but had gone to collect countless
reinforcements, and on their return there
would be great happenings. One manifesto
ran to 10,000 hieroglyphics and covered a
paddock of paper.
Six armies on an average can be descried
amid the smoke and dust and verbiage, and
on the average they have all deserted six
times and served six generals in turn. The
usual cause of desertion was that their
pay was in arrear or that they were offered
liigher wages and shorter hours. War lords
who are under a cloud turn up any day at
any city, with a bodyguard and a trainload
of loot and concubines, and leave again
giving a wrong address as their destination.
A few cities, including Nan-king, are re-
ported as on fire, having been set alight
as a protest against something, or to annoy
somebody, or possibly for the sake of the
insurance.
There are no discernible rules to the
game, which appears to be run on the catch-
as-Chow-can principle, and the original
cause of the trouble, if there was one, is
never mentioned now. Almost the only
native institution which doesn’t seem to be
more or less dissolved and flowing all over
the place is the republican Cabinet at Pekin,
which preserves its job and its dignity, even
if its writ doesn’t run far. Thanks to the
introduction of railways and steamships
this is the most rapid civil scrap in Chow
history. Precious internal disturbances
gave the impression of wandering round in
a hearse.

The Plagues of Egypt.
Speaking with all possible charity, the
death of Zaghlui. Pasha will come as a
blessed relief to the British Government,
and the Government of every other country
with legitimate interests in Egypt. Be-
ginning as a protege of the Administration
which lifted him to power and honor, he
lived to become the soul of revolt against
the benefactors of himself and his country.
He was a fellah of the fellaheen, born in
the ranks of the lowest and most oppressed
peasantry in the world. But for the
British he could never have hoped to leave
the ploughtail or the shadoof. That he was
a man of the people was responsible for
his extraordinary success with the masses,
and there is good reason to think that, in
his later role of liberator from the foreign
oppressor, he received much covert support
from the members of the old regime, who
saw in the withdrawal of European control
a hope of reviving the old-time welter of
loot and oppression on which their order
had battened. With all his genius for in-
trigue, he had the faults of his race strongly
accentuated, and an utter inability to fore-
see consequences—which is the hall-mark of
the professional disrupter the world over.
While he lived he was a serious menace to
the Empire. He has left no one capable as
himself to carry on the task he set himself;
and without him it seems likely that the
extremist spirit of Egypt will pass into
quieter and saner paths.

Prevention of T.B. Among Children.
It has been estimated that 50 per cent, of
T.B. cases in children are due to the bovine
type of bacilli, indicating that the medium
of transmission of the disease has been the
milk.
Under a new American scheme the milk-
supplying areas are divided into sections
and each of these sections has its cattle
tested every six months. First the milk
is tested; if this shows a positive result
the affected cow or cows are tracked down
by trying the herd one by one. The posi-
tive beasts are carried away to slaughter.
Once a section has been declared clear no
beast is allowed to enter until it has been
tested for T.B.
There is still much doubt about the rela-
tion of the human type of bacillus and the
bovine type. The former may possibly be
but a form of the latter—merely camou-
flaged by dwelling in the human tissues.
That being so, with the eradication of
bovine T.B. the occurrence of the human
bacillus may become quite rare.

The Sword and the Clod.
There is interest in the statement of the
Rev. H. E. Wareham, a Central African
missionary of many years’ standing, as to
the future of Mohammedanism. He told a
Sydney audience the other day that Islam
was losing its hold on the countries of its
earlier practice, but was spreading rapidly
among the millions of primitive and illit-
erate folk who make up the bulk of inland
Africa’s population.
There is even a special interest in Dr.
Wareham’s story for Australia, cut off from
Moslem influence, but still a unit of the
greatest Moslem Empire on earth. For there
seems a strange analogy between the spread
of Islam and of the doctrine of Bolsh.
Mahomet banded together a wretched and
oppressed people by the promise of a para-
dise in the world to be, with unlimited loot-
ing on earth of those who did not profess
the new faith. His doctrine differs little
in essentials from that preached by the
Soviet’s founders. He offered the rest of
the world its choice between the Law and
the Sword. The Soviet’s insistence on the
dictatorship of the proletariat is neither
more nor less than that.
But there the resemblance ends. Islam
captured half the known world of its earlier
day; but if it destroyed mightily it also
built up, for the Arab endowed the Europe
of the Dark Ages with the beginnings of
most of our important sciences. The Red
Russian, impotent with the sword, is
relying on corruption and international
treachery to win his world. Islam was at
least built on a great and honest conviction.
The modern Terror which aspires to emu-
late the once all-conquering success of
Mahomet’s followers seems to have thrown
to the winds every conviction, honest and
otherwise, save that which obsessed Lamb’s
famous Chinaman—that to obtain roast
pork it was necessary to burn the house
down.
And it would seem —for Dr. Wareham is
backed by sound authorities—that the trend
of Islam and Bolshevism is in the same
direction—the recruiting of the ignorant and
the greedy. Both have been and are being
rejected by the more educated and the
modernised—-to use a trite phrase, the intel-
ligentsia. The hope of each lies in the clod
and the unscrupulous exploiters of the clod,
who see material and financial gain for
themselves in the exploiting.

The bungalow dweller with a vacant allot-
ment on either side of his trimly kept home
has a lively dread of a butcher or a baker
squatting down on one of these eligible
sites and bringing flies, noise and unpleasant
odors to disturb his enjoyment and prob-
ably reduce the selling or letting value of
his red-tiled property. It has therefore be-
come a practice for municipal councils to
consult the interests of their ratepayers by
passing by-laws defining certain portions
of the municipality to be shop areas and
other portions residential areas. The Vic-
torian City of St. Ivilda. in view probably
of the fact that it is a city and therefore a
cut above the mere suburb, drafted a regu-
lation which had the effect, at least by im-
plication, of banishing from the residential
area not merely the shopkeeper, the laundry-
man. the wood and coal merchant and the
like, but also the offices of barristers, solici-
tors, medical practitioners and “members of
other lawful professions.” This haughty
and exclusive regulation came before
Justice McArthur, who struck out as bad
such portions of it as tended to herd the
members of the learned professions with
the grocers and the vendors of hokey-
pokey and lemonade.

£l7OO PRIZE STORY COMPETITION.
"The Bulletin” wants the Australian novel to take the place of
the American and English productions which now flood the bookshops.
A school of short-story writers has been built up in Australia
through “The Bulletin’s” efforts during more than 45 years past.
Now “The Bulletin” is going to see whether a school of novelists
cannot also be built up.
To this end it offers a minimum of £l7OO in prizes for novels
during the next three years.
The first competition will close on June 30, 1928. For this the
prizes will be: First, £500; 2nd, £125; 3rd, £75.
All persons Australian-born are eligible; also all persons bona fide
resident in Australia.
The stories are to be available for serial publication in “The
Bulletin” and “The Woman’s Mirror.” Otherwise, copyright will
belong wholly to the writer; all picture rights will likewise remain hi 3
property.
POLITICAL
POINTS
The Commonwealth went to N’York for
a loan of £N,200.000 last week, and Unc. Sam
produced it within two hours. Australia
seems to think it ought to be very proud of
itself. But the man who has just pawned
something hasn’t much to be proud of, really ;
Ikey. who has the money to lend, has 'the
best right to be satisfied. It might even pay
the borrower to find out how the lender
got into a position to lend. In the U.S. case
it is by doing most of the things that Aus-
tralia is neglecting to do and refusing to do
most of the things Australia is doing with
enthusiasm.
The Commonwealth’s second New York
loan was neither so large nor so cheap as
the first one, but it was vastly cheaper than
the two that N.S.W. raised on its own in
the interim. It is explained in a smug
general way that the money has been ob-
tained on behalf of the States for public
works and possibly a trifle for Common-
wealth works. But the proceeds arc being
largely or wholly shifted to London, and as
neither States nor Commonwealth have any
extensive public works there the statement
may be described as a smug general lie.
Retired Judges Edmunds and Bevan and
Loxton, K.C., have been appointed a Com-
mission to inquire whether it is true that, in
effect. “Goad old Piddo” is a creature of
the Government. Some people wonder why
Loxton was appointed. Other people may
suggest that some judicial vacancies will have
to be filled soon, and that the Government
wants to find out whether Loxton is a fair-
minded man.
One of the bright spots on the horizon
is the rabbit. In the space between 1922
and 1924 the export value of rabbit and
hare hides increased by £2,000,000 per
annum, and even then the goods were mostly
sent away in the raw so that the profits of
treatment were lost.
Victoria has about finished the inspection
of its great soldier and civilian settlement
scheme, the work of Lawson and the Allan-
cocks. The loss is estimated at £23,000.000
plus the failure to make any perceptible
settlement except in the metropolis. Some
shire councils are deep in the soup, the
Government having bought out ratepayers
and replaced them with novices who can’t
afford to pay rates. A special and liberal
sinking fund to pay off £23,000,000 is now
in order.
The municipality of Sydney has a popula-
lion of 10S.000, and, owing to the spacious
ways of its Labor aldermen, this handful
of people want £4,250,000 of loan money
this year, or about £4O per inhabitant. Quite
a respectable public debt in itself. It will be
a serious matter if Sydney has some day to
be abandoned to its creditors.
Hogan and Co. (Vic.) may decide to
make the duty on cheques 2d. instead of
ii penny. Revision of legal and Titles Office
tees, together with other odds and ends, is
also likely to be proposed. There was an
idea at first of levying another half-millio.t
in income-tax, but the amount of the demand
for that species of impost is now likely to be
reduced. Hogan is bent on making his books
honestly balance.
Within the past fortnight three Australian
Premiers have been confronted with sinister
outbreaks of job-control among Government
employees. Lang is all for crawling to the
job-controllers; Butler’s way in South Aus.
and McCormack’s in Queensland is to dis-
miss them. And their way is the right
way. The other is a cowardly surrender
to mob law, and mob law is the forerunner
of civil war.
The Broken Hill Prop, and Block 14, next
door, are on the point of closing down ; and
the British and others may have to follow—
will have to follow unless either costs are
reduced or metal prices are improved. But
there is no thought of honestly facing the
situation : the only thing anybody seems able
to suggest is unemployment relief—with
borrowed money, of course. And as such
works never earn their interest, the result is
merely to make to-morrow pay for to-day.
It is a mean and cowardly age in politics.
E. W. Ericsen, “secretary of the Barrier
Industrial Council,” tells the local people
that the talk of closing down the poorer
mines is “a threat, ” and that if they do close
NO GOOD TO THE HORSE.
“The Vic. Hogan Government is pathetically anxious for the Federal Government to take over the
losses on Soldier Settlement, which it finds most embarrassing.”
HIGAB (to Bruce): "Take this top bundle, will you? — it’ll make things lighter for me.”
THE PATIENT BEAST OF BURDEN: “Yes, but what about me?”
down it will be a lockout. If Mr. Ericsen has
a home be has also locked out all the
unemployed cooks, nurses, footmen, chauf-
feurs, butlers and bottlewashers in Australia.
Why doesn’t he employ them? For the same
simple reason that presently, unless con-
ditions improve, some of the cos. won’t be
able to employ miners and drivers—because
lie can’t pay them. We shall never have
peace till the foolish Ericsens realise that the
simple rules which apply to the cottage apply
also to the workshop and the mine.
Dr. Evatt (Balmain) and A. McClelland
(Liverpool Plains) are the last of the anti-
Lang M’s.L.A. to be deprived of nomination
by tlie pre-selection box of tricks. Evatt won
his first ballot, but another being ordered—
apparently because lie won too easily—he
was beaten by the block vote of Red coal-
miners, it being arranged that their block vote
should be preponderant. He is going to stand
as a Laborite opposed to “a system of pre-
selection which has broken down before the
electors’ eyes because of its corruption.” So
some good lias come out of an evil business.
I ic. Assembly has passed the bill providing
for the erection of Spencer-street bridge, at
a cost of £350,000, including £150,000 com-
pensation for Melbourne Harbor Trust. It
agreed to let the Labor Ministry decide
whether the work should be done by day
labor or contract; whether the Upper
Chamber will be equally confiding remains
to be seen. Perhaps it will, for it has a
good deal of faith in Jones, Minister for
Works. Jones is the author of the bill, and
has charge of it in the Plush House.
Seven gentlemen have been appointed a
Federal Commission to inquire into desir-
able amendments of the Constitution. They
are not apparently to recommend changes
even if they have definite opinions on the
subject, but are to sit on a bench and listen
to the opinions of others who think it worth
while to come to the court and talk. The
business will perish by the wayside, either
because the Ministry doesn’t feel game to
chance adopting the amended Constitution
as its own legislative child, or because Par-
liament fails to take an interest in it, or, as
a final resort, because the referendum results
in a languid chuck-out as usual. No suc-
cessful constitution was ever made by Royal
Commissioners drifting around to collect
intellectual scraps.
In the opinion of Vic. Crown Solicitor and
two counsel, Weigall and Lowers, Melb. City
Council has broken the covenants under
which it holds its city market sites, and the
Crown could step in and resume possession.
Similar information is extracted periodically
but nothing happens, and nothing is likely
to happen now. although Land Minister
Bailey says Cabinet is considering what it
will do. The Western Market (Collins-
street West) is worth a quarter of a mil-
lion or more, and possibly the Eastern
(Bourke-Exhibition streets) and the Vic.
(Victoria-Elizabeth streets) would bring
another £350,000. The Western and Eastern
properties are used for offices and shops
(mainly), and a huge income is derived by
the corporation, which got the two areas for
a quit rent of a farthing each “on demand.”
Commonwealth Arbitration Judge Beeby
was lately called upon to fix up an award
for the metal trades. The metals liked one
part of the award, and went on strike against
the part they didn’t like. The Court offered
to reconsider the features objected to, pro-
vided the metals would save its face by going
back to work. Of course it was assumed that
unless a rehearing led to the Court climbing
down, the strike, which was partly off, would
be fully on again. If a Criminal Court said
the sentence would be six months, but
couldn’t even make the defendant promise to
lock himself up in his own bedroom, it should
be strengthened if possible or abolished if
impossible, and the principle applies all
round. No one is ever likely to give any
Arbitration Court a criminal jurisdiction
and a gaol of its own, so abolition appears
due. Then it is possible that a workable sub-
stitute would be agreed upon.
A breeze ruffled the calm of Tas. polities
when Piggott, M.H.A., asked for a Royal
Commission to inquire into the administra-
tion of the Public Trust office and the con-
nection therewith of Attorney-General Ogil-
vie’s legal firm. Piggott alleged that the
firm in question had obtained mortgages,
etc., for clients on better terms than it
would have got if the junior partner had not
been Ministerial head of the department. In
a half-hour’s reply Ogilvie insisted that
everything was square and above board: but
feeling ran high, and subsequently Premier
Lyons promised to ask a Supreme Court
Judge to inquire whether the Public Trust
Act requires amendment. Whatever the out-
come of the inquiry, the dust-up seems to have
ended the non-party era.
The National Federation of Hosiery Manu-
facturers is raising a dust in England be-
cause this country has raised the duty on
socks and stockings in the hope that by
promoting local industry it won’t need to
borrow so much abroad to pay for imported
socks and stockings. Britain imports more
than £2,000,000 worth of hose per annum
itself, mostly from the United States, and it
could more than make up any loss here by
putting on a duty that would secure it the
use of its own market. But the ghostly fear
that Adam Smith wouldn’t like it is always
in the way.
Still another Victorian ex-soldier, having
put in five years struggling with the allot-
ment which his grateful country sold him.
has gone off his head and committed suicid •
after doing his best to destroy the family
with an axe. There are rather many such
cases. Two prevailing causes of homicidal
mania are wounds the patient received at
the war and the farm he received after the
wa r.
Although lie knows that the majority of
the Cabinet is against the restoration of
the police sacked in 192.'! after the strike,
I’rendergast, political head of the Police De-
partment. still champions the ex-1 lops. Re-
cruiting has been stopped because Hogan will
not incur any additional expenditure till
extra revenue, for which he is budgeting, is
provided by Parliament —at least, that is
the explanation—and the force is 200 con-
stables short. There is a strong suspicion
that circumstances favourable to the ex-police
are being deliberately created ; all the same.
Hogan and Jones are hardly likely to
risk wrecking the Ministry by reinstating
the strikers. Reinstatement was not in
Hogan’s Ballan programme.
“Suit to Rectify a Register” is a line in
the law reports which grows wearisome—
at least so far as N.S.W. is concerned. The
monotonous tale is that somebody put on
the market a concern known as Aggravated
Swindles, Limited, in which practically the
whole of the 125,000 shares were reserved
for the general public. The co. proposed to
extract the cube root by a process whim
would enable its oil contents to be put on
the market at a low but immensely remu-
nerative figure. Somebody having persuaded
Adam Phule to sign for a quantity of
shares, the object of the suit is to get his
name taken off the register, and the object
of the counter-claim is to keep his name on
and make him pay up in full. It would be
a great saving if there was a sort or Torrens
titles office where the prospectus of every co.
which proposed to ask the public for money
had to be lodged, accompanied by the proper
fee. Then nothing should be done till the
document emerged with a certificate to tin-
effect that it was mentally and physically
sound in every particular.
Bukharin, one of the noisiest politicians
Russia possesses, declares persistently that
war with the British Empire is inevitable,
and that it will be soon. Britain provides a
large market for Russian goods, and it has
made amazingly little fuss about its people
being robbed to the extent of one qr two
tliousu 'd million pounds by the Soviet' I ,rs.
Nor did it complain much when the meddlers
at Moscow explained categorically that
foreigners visiting Russia were liable to
execution without trial, and executed at least
one under particularly horrible circumstances
to illustrate the point. But it is held that
the refusal to maintain a British ambassador
at Moscow or to receive a Russian one in
London amounts to a casus belli and tha.
the insult must be blotted out with blood.
The S. Aus. Parliament will have to elect
another stopgap Senator presently; Barwell
goes to the London office to succeed Price.
Harwell confesses that he was out of his
element in the Senate —“had I stayed there
much longer it would have broken in.v heart.
Senators from other States might retort that
he .stayed long enough to get on their nerves.

“K.A.” : It was on the Melbourne-Sydney

“G.F.E.”: The cheap-jack, with one eye
on a large policeman who was cruising along
a few chains away, was making a last
desperate effort to dispose of some of his
wares. "Coin’on, gents! For the considera-
tion of a cuppler shillings we are presenting
you with this magnificent 14-carat, gold-
nibbed, self-filling, non-leaking, fully-guaran-
teed fountain-pen. And as a further induce-
ment, to each and every purchaser of these

mopping his brow in desperation, he was
about to shut up his bag of tricks, when a
telegraph messenger-boy tendered the requis-
ite florin in a grimy hand. The kerbstone-
merchant raised his eyes heavenwards, and
murmured feelingly: “And a little child shall
lead them!” I was so touched by the apt
quotation that I parted with my two bob
almost mechanically. To date the fountain-
pen has stubbornly refused to fount and
the pencil won’t write, but the bottle-opener
seems to have possibilities.

“Yardley”: In my remote days at sea
mashed potatoes thickly spread with pepper
(B. 18/8/’27) furnished a remedy for sea-
sickness seriously recommended and often
tried by those who wouldn’t take alcohol or
couldn’t get it. In the case of members of
the crew they hadn’t much chance, for
brandy was supposed to be carried solely
for medicinal purposes, and the skipper, being
also doctor, seldom prescribed it for any
ailments except Ins own. Ilis favorite spe-
cific for sea-sickness in a member of the
ship’s company was Epsom salts. There was
another fo’c’s'le prescription which I still
remember. The sufferer was advised to tie
a string to a slab of fat pork, swallow the
slab, pull it back with the string, and re-
peat the process until he felt better.

“S. Inna”: During a quiet night in a
country pub Mrs. Bung suggested I might
give her 11-year-old a hand with his home-
lesson. Having done my best I casually
glanced at some of the youngster’s previous
efforts in composition and came across an
essay on Solomon. It ended : “King Solomon
was a very good man till near the end of his
reign, when he fell into the company of bad
women.” The teacher’s annotation in red ink
will always remain a treasured memory with
me. It ran : “This should have been ex-
plained more fully.”

“Wang”: Pipe-smokers had an unsolicited
testimonial handed to them in a Melbourne
suburban court the other day when a weedy-
looking youth was being charged with
attempting to relieve a young woman of her
handbag. The lady had stated in her evi-
dence that when the accused approached her
lie was smoking. “What was lie smoking—a
pipe?” asked the accused’s counsel. The
lady looked at him scornfully. “Ilis sort
don’t smoke pipes,” she replied. “I’d never
be afraid of being interfered with by a pipe-
smoker.”
“Merris”: Speaking of some Diggers’
sheik-like qualities in the epistolary line (B.
18/8/’27), I recall one Lothario who wrote
letters (not merely postcards) to 17 separate
and distinct charmers in one week. We
were lying in Lemnos Harbor, and stormy
weather was preventing us from lauding.
“Dearest Maud,” he wrote, “Cooped up here
on the troopship, my thoughts stray back to
that wonderful evening we spent at Hen-
1ey”.... “Darling Alice,” began the second,
“Cooped up here on the troopship, my
thoughts stray back to that mystic night

“S. Inna” : It reminded me partly of Lot's
wife's fate and partly of Peeping Tom's in-
discretion. In a swagger North Coast pub
a painter was diligently working at the top
of a 12ft. ladder, which incidentally com-
manded a first-class view of the nether limbs
of anyone mounting the staircase. A trim
house maiden tripped up the stairs murmur-
ing roguishly as she went: “Dick, don’t you
look.” With some pals I turned to see the
reason for the admonition, and while w T e were
discovering the same a terrific crash dis-
tracted our attention. We turned to find
Dick on the ground, paint cascading from
his face and hair and oozing from his ears.
The obvious inference was that he had looked.

“Miro” : At Auckland about 2 a.m. a sus-
picious-looking car with a lady at the wheel
attracted the attention of a policeman:
before he could investigate a man dashed
out of a shop in which lie had evidently
been prospecting, and the couple sped away.
Stopping a passing motor-cyclist, the con-
stable gave chase, but was soon out-distanced.
In a suburban street a detective and another
constable were exchanging notes when they
heard the car approaching at a liell-for-
leather pace. Focussing their lights on it
and finding the wheel in possession of a lady
who intrepidly charged them and sent them
reeling into the gutter, their interest became
intense, and they swiftly commandeered a taxi
and gave chase. At 50 miles an hour the
two cars dashed through the scenery until
the leading one ran into a ditch. The
fugitives abandoned it and fled across coun-
try, pursued by the police and the taxi-
driver. The man managed to escape, but the
lady failed to outrun two hefty policemen.
Her co-shopbreaker was later found peace-
fully asleep at his home.

“Boronia”: An unfamiliar word will some-
times turn away wrath as effectively as a
soft one. A teacher friend of mine who
runs a school in the W.A. backblocks was
organising a concert with his 80-odd
pupils. A few days before the entertain-
ment an aggrieved-looking railway fettler,
father of one of the pupils, called at the
school and menacingly demanded to be told
why liis Jimmie hadn’t been picked to sing a
soiig. One reason was that the boy has a
voice which suggests a hand-saw being used
on galvanised iron ; but the dominie has ac-
quired some of the wisdom of the serpent in
the course of his long dealings with his
charges’ parents. Jimmie, he readily con-
ceded. had a nice voice, but unfortunately
it did not possess the correct timbre for solo
singing. The parent nodded understandingly
and left, obviously impressed.

“Carisbrook, .Tun.”: The Malabar had

“X2X” : Although Sydney’s Tank Stream
disappeared years ago beneath masses of
masonry, it still makes its presence felt.
Near where it winds its subterranean course
into the harbor there are a number of build-
ings with their foundations right on the

a well-known life-assurance society, has its
strongroom in the old course of the stream,
with the result tnat moisture continually
seeps in and damages the papers. All docu-

his greatest triumph tan unsuccessful attempt at
a non-stop 100 hours’ dance] .... America is always
foremost in all such daring and original feats.
Lindbergh’s recent flight across the Atlantic is only
on'e other example.” —Letter to Melbourne Sun.
Undaunted scions of a dauntless race,
In whom hath grim determination wed
’With gay, light-hearted courage, here’s your
place!
Here in the van of heroes must you tread,
O fledglings worthy of your soaring breed!
O proper sons of sturdy pioneers,
In lasting fame must lie your fitting meed.
But hearken now unto your kinsmen’s
cheers:
Lindbergh, intolerant of an ocean’s sway—
And daring, dancing Alexander J.
For one the hungry menace of the seas,
The lost, lone tracks of air, the engine’s
roar
Of hoarse defiance at immensities
That brooded death from shore to sound-
ing shore;
And for the other... .how the limelight laved
Those cutely pointing toes and bending
thews,
.is hour by dreadful hour lie nobly braved
The horror of—the Hooji-booji Blues!
Lindbergh, who walked with death, an easy
prey—
And jigging, jazzing Alexander J.
Around this shrunken world the tidings speed
Of wonder fresh that for a moment stuns
Our doubting senses: by some peerless deed
A nation is ennobled of her sons.
A people’s valor we may not deny,
Nor hesitate in world acclaim to share;
But, oh, the humor that has passed them by
Who in all soberness can calmly pair
The eagle, Lindbergh, on his lofty way
With this —this—well, this Alexander jay!
VICTORIA.

“The Immature Male”: The Hyde Park
(►Sydney) drunk sat up suddenly, finished
what was left of a flask of rum and, stagger-
ing across College-street, lurched into the
Museum, apparently under the impression
that it was a hotel. Clawing his way up
the stairs he ultimately came to anchor in
the department labelled “Crustacea,” and
corrected his first impressions. Staggering
up to a person in authority who was chang-
ing the mothballs in the. butterfly collection,
lie demanded: “Shay, giv’us a cray and a
(liic!) coupler pounds of prawns.” The
entomologist caught his breath for a moment.
“My good man, we don’t sell crayfish here.”
he said curtly but not unkindly when he had
grasped the situation. “Don’ ya ‘good man’
me l” bellowed the drunk. “You gimme a
cray, or there'll be trouble, see!” He laid
unsteady hands on the unresponsive one as if
to emphasise his threat, and the spilled moth-
balls fell to the floor with a clatter like that of
hailstones. The man of science bellowed lus-
tily for help, and my final view of the disturb-
anee was that of several panting attendants
endeavoring to prise the drunk from the
embalmed body of a sun-fish, to which he
clung with limpet-like tenacity, yelling the
while, “ 'Ere, leggo me crook arm, blast
yers! I only wanted a Cray, I’ve got the
money ! Leggo !” Ultimately he was coaxed
down the stairs, and pushed into the street,
still muttering aggrievedly.

"Blue Duck”: Nineteen drunks were pre-
sented at the Port Adelaide police-court the
other Monday, 15 of them collected during the
Day of Rest. It made the S.M. curious to
know why this particular Sunday should
have been such a thirsty one. A police-
sergeant enlightened him. There were sev-
eral empty beer-barrels on the wharves; these
had been swilled out, “but still had plenty of
bite,” concluded the witness, sagely.

“E.S." : Considering the number of jerry-
built houses in some Sydney suburbs, it is
fortunate that the over-packed area is not
on the track of cyclones. I watched some
carpenters at work on a modern dwelling
the other day. Instead of the studs (up-
rights) being mortised into groundplate and
wallplate, a thin pine batten was nailed to
the top and bottom ends, the whole line of
studs placed at once, and the battens nailed
to the plates. When the weatherboards and
lining went on, of course no one could sus-
pect the lightning process.

“Stock” : From the report of a Melbourne
Diocesan Mission on one of the institutions
which it runs:—
The Cathedral rendering of Stainer’s “Crucifixion”
(by radio) on Good Friday evening was most beauti-
ful, and a fitting ending to that day, when the
girls had been touched by the Three Hours Service
in Chapel, and the “Hallelujah Chorus” after Even-
song on Easter day was especially clear and impres-
sive. The vegetable garden has been most prolific,
thanks to the permanent water supply.
One eye on Better Things, as it were, and
the other on the cabbages.

“Eureka”: As the loneliest hermit in Aus-
tralia I nominate the recluse of Piper’s Flat,
within the shadow of Mount Kosciusko.
Once a year he visits Kiandra to lay in a
supply of food for himself and his dog and
a batch of newspapers. During the winter
he is snowed in.

“S.V.D.”: A good many officers and n.c.o.’s
of the A.I.F. must have had brothers under
them. In 1916, my late brother, one month
short of 21 years and with 22 months’ A.I.F.
experience, successfully claimed my transfer
from the 23rd Battalion, I being just 19
years of age and a Digger for 17 months.
Thus for a period he was my 0.C., having
risen from the ranks to be signalling
officer of the 7th Battalion. Doubtless there
were a few cases of younger brothers having
charge of their elders. I never came across
a son in direct command of liis father, but
I shouldn’t wonder if there were instances of
even this.
A BIT OF EARLY FAMILY HISTORY.
“If a girl sets to work to catch a man she’ll do it. Even Adam couldn’t help himself,

THE DIRTY DOG.
FREDA: “Fed up! Of course I am. I’ve lost
all confidence in men."
EDA: “But, why, darling?"
FREDA: “Well, the last three times I’ve gone
to the movies with another boy I’ve
spotted Fred there with another girl.”
“Kai te Kuri” : Touching the dangers of
gas even when not taken internally (B.
14/7/’27). When the Maori Pioneer Batta-
lion was laying a plank road near Hooge
crater, almost a whole company was caught
before we tumbled to the business. The
planks had been carted up to a dump near
Burr cross-roads by motor-lorry and left
there for a night, during which they acquired
a liberal coating of mustard-gas. In the
morning they were collected by unsuspect-
ing Maoris and carried up to the job. A
day or two later the hands and shoulders
of most of the carriers developed black, putre-
fying blisters, which took weeks of hospital
treatment to heal,

“Snowdon”: Firemen’s queer jobs (B.
4/8/’27) ? The Hobart brigade has twice
saved the Zoo lion from drowning in the
water pit which forms the front boundary
of its den. And once the firemen sallied
forth with block and tackle and rescued a
horse which had managed to get on to a
factory roof and was reluctant to evacuate
the position.

“Lao-dah” : Geelong is setting an example
to a good many other places in the way it
is tackling the proposal to convert the road
to Melbourne from the bleakest highway in
the world into a pleasant, tree-lined avenue.
Local townplanners are voluntarily turning
out to plant the trees, which have been sup-
plied by various departments, timber mer-
chants are offering the wood for guards, and
owners and drivers of motor trucks are
carting the material free of charge. If all
the districts along the route follow suit
the job should be completed almost before
a paid day-labor gang has finished spitting
on its hands.

“Nakhoda”: If the movie factories spring-
ing up all over Melbourne want a good “loca-
tion” they don’t need to go further than 50
miles from the G.P.O. Donna Buang is the
spot. This precipitous mountain still carries
magnificent' stands of giant gums rising
up in heaps of shed bark like slim Hebes
disrobed for the bath. After a heavy snow-
fall the thousands of prone trees bear a
layer of white icing, the tree-ferns serve
peche Melba in elegant epergnes, and moun-
tain lories and rosellas alighting on snow-
encrusted shrubs provide a momentary vision
of a stage fairyland by Oscar Asche. The
fields of snow near the summit are wide
enough to supply a camera-setting of a
frozen waste. Timber tracks climb steeply
up through this landscape at about the
grade of a ladder placed against a wall.
The logs are loaded on to trucks and shot
down the rails at approximately 300 miles
a'n hour. It wouldn’t take long for the
scenario-writers to equip this romantic-
looking spot with abo. Pocahontases, bush-
rangers, gold-smugglers, Tom Mixes and
damsels in distress.

“Pfella” : The habit of lashing down dwell-
ings in Groperland’s Nor’-West began long
before lugger-chains and anchors were avail-
able for the work (B. 4/8/’27). Nearly
every exposed house along the coast is wired
down to something heavy underneath the
surface, and many a housewife has used
such wires as a clothes-line. Even the
nigger in the land of willy-willies sees to it
that his ramshackle abode is secured by
tough vines fastened to rocks sunk in the
earth.
* * * *
“Haka”: The discussion had turned on
various religious leaders, and after Paul,
Luther, Wesley, General Booth, Gypsy Smith
and several others had been passed under
review, somebody mentioned Brigham Young.
“What tis Prigham Young do?” inquired
Henare, who was an interested listener.
“Oh,” said someone, “he was the man who
had a wife for every day in the month.”
“A—w, I know tat,” drawled Henare, “but
what he do in te tay-time?”
* * * *
“Sebrof”: Quaint combinations in call-
ings? I know a youth at Fitzroy (Vic.) who
is a blacksmith’s striker during working
hours ; at night and at week-ends he takes
his place in the ranks of a badly-known
“push” and pulls pickets off fences, hurls
beer-bottles about or kicks policemen. As a
side-line he makes ladies’ handbags, for which
he finds a ready market in a smart Collins-
street shop. His taste and skill are really
remarkable, but I suspect that were his
occupation to become known to his intimates
social ostracism would follow.

“Hostilities in China have been interfered with by
severe weather.... At a stormy conference of Nan-

The wars are raging in China; Chiang Kai-

of pay also,
Or casually retiring because of rain or snow.
But in my Sydney suburb, remote from old-

No hint of sandalled shindies by any chance

There are no tramps of armies, no verbal
interludes.
All unperturbed, impassive, John balances
his pails,
Or frees the homely cabbage of interfering

liis China is Australia; his province New
South Wales.
John may belong to factions; perchance in
dreams he sees
111-paid, disjointed armies eager to strike and
seize
But altogether reluctant to soak in the rain
or freeze.
John may bestow approval on what they
do or dare
In China. But I’ve a notion lie really

A tinker’s dam for China —because he isn’t

“M.”: Randolph Bedford, in his
article on “Australian Worthies”
(R.P. 11/8/’27), repeats the old myth
that Anthony Van Diemen had a
daughter named Maria, although he
qualifies it a little by admitting that
she was not the lover of Abel Tasman.
Flindeifc started the story (in his
“Terra Australis” ; he was followed by
Dunmore Lang and others, and a fair
quantity of sob stuff, in prose and
verse, has been turned out since then
about the young and intrepid Tasman’s
infatuation for a charmer high above
him in the social sphere, to wit, Maria
Van Diemen. Actually there is no
evidence that the man who was Gov-
ernor of Batavia in 1642 ever had a
daughter at all: on Tasman’s own
showing, moreover, such places as
Maria Island, Cape Maria Van Die-
men, and Maria Bay in Tonga were
named “in compliment to the wife of
Governor-General Van Diemen.” There
is another question relating to Tas-
man (and the word Tasmania) that
has never been conclusively answered,
viz., how did lie come by that surname
at a time when family names were not
yet in vogue in the province of Gro-
ningen, where he was born? The late
J. Backhouse Walker, in his book on
early Tasmania, pointed out that in
the old records Tasman is often desig-
nated simply Abel Janzoon (in Eng-
lish, Johnson) ; lie was, in fact, mar-
ried to his second wife under that
name. Walker conjectured that the
affix Tasman was used to distinguish
the navigator from some other Abel
Janzoon, and may have been derived
from a boat or craft called the Tascli
(bag or net) belonging to the family.

“C. Coral”: Touching the wreck of
the French ship St. Paul in 1858, the
consumption of the great majority of
her 327 Chinese passengers by the
natives of Rossel Island, and the yarn
of one lone survivor who became a
hermit (B. 14/7/’27), I suspect part
of the story arose out of the adven-
tures of a white castaway, one Nar-
cisse Peltier. This lad was brought
into_ Somerset by the brig John Bell in
1875, 17 years after the wreck, having
been found amongst the natives of the
north-east coast at a spot near Cape
Sidmouth. He had almost forgotten
his native tongue; but later on he was
able to communicate his tale. He was
a native of France, and a boy of 12
at the time the St. Paul was wrecked.
With the captain and five others he
left the wreck in a boat, hoping to
reach New Caledonia, but apparently
got down the Australian coast. The
story told by Narcisse was that they
put into a bay for water and somehow
he was left behind and fell into the
hands of the blacks. The tribe treated
him kindly, but would not allow him
to communicate with any passing ves-
sels. His body bore various tribal
marks, and his nose and ears were
pierced and perforated. From Somer-
set lie was sent down to Brisbane, and
the Government officer of the period,
writing to the Colonial Secretary, pre-
sumed that “the Vice-Consul for
France would reimburse the Govern-
ment for this expense and would take
steps to have Peltier forwarded to his
own country.” If Peltier ever got
there he had the material for a more
veracious story than De Rougemont
unfolded in England 40 years later.
“Mako”: Something akin to the process
by which various native tribes shrink human
heads to small dimensions while preserving
the proportions must have gone on inside a
safe which was subjected to intense heat
in a recent fire at Dunedin (M.L.). Several
legal documents were removed after the
blaze, and while the contents were clearly
legible and the paper practically undamaged
they were found to have shrunk to less than
a quarter of the normal size, and to have
taken on the pale-yellow appearance of old
ivory. Otago Museum is angling for the
curiosities.

“C.P.8.": Having no pretensions to a
place in the sheik class, I felt less flattered
than embarrassed when the florid and slightly
sozzled lady who was my neighbor in the
crowded tram-car singled me out for special
attention. Amid the unrestrained giggles of
several delighted flappers she lurched affec-
tionately close to me, and I had a deadly
fear she might throw her arms around my
neck at any moment. It was quite a telief
when she rose, but my heart sank when she
subsided into her seat again. After this per-
formance had been repeated several times it
occurred to me that she might have missed
her stopping-place while exercising her fas-
cinations on me or be in need of directions, and
I interrupted her chatter with a crisp “Where
are you getting off, madam?” Quick and
warm came the response, audible all over the
tram, "Anywhere you like, dearie !” I didn’t
waff for the next stop, preferring to risk my
life by jumping off.
'i : ❖ *
’f).D.” : I have heard town-criers or bell-
men (B. 11/8/‘2<) in several N.S.W. towns,
including Bathurst, Tamworth and Armidale.
But has any other Bulletin reader heard
a night-watchman—not the sort who march
round warehouses trying doors and windows,
but a survival of the old-time London public
utility who patrolled the streets crying the
hours? I heard one when on a visit to
Orange (N.S.W.) somewhere about 1875.
His call, of which I still retain a vivid
remembrance, came to my wondering ears
one wakeful hour: “Two o’clock of a frosty
morning, and all’s well !” He chanted the
first seven words on one note. The “all’s” was
long drawn our and pitched somewhat higher.
* * * *
“Columba”: Some heraldic authority has
discovered that the City of Melbourne is
using a coat of arms which is not registered
at the Heralds’ College and for which no
“grant of arms” can be traced. This is an
undignified state of affairs for a place of
such importance, although doubtless there
are many Australian towns similarly cir-
cumstanced. Heraldry, for all the ridicule
that is poured on it nowadays, has, or should
have, a real value ; much of English history
can be read through the arms of English
families and the old English guilds, and it
would not be a bad idea to bring the whole

“The £200,000 which the Federal Government has given to Civil Aviation automatically

subject under review in Australia. Certainly
some of the civic devices that are in use
seem ludicrously inappropriate. The offi-
cial seal of the liandwick (Sydney) Council,
for instance, depicts a beehive and other
emblems of industry, quaint symbols for a non-
industrial suburb—unless horse- and pony-
racing can be called an industry. For all
that, the fact may have some interest for
the historian and archaeologist who seeks to
reconstruct the early-day Randwick.

“Chancery Lane”: In the Fitzroy (Vic.)
Police Court recently a man was charged
with the theft of a number of collars and
handkerchiefs. Asked how he would plead, he
look off his collar and handed it to the
Bench for inspection. It bore the same
initials on it as the articles which were
alleged to be stolen. “I’ve got a handker-
chief here with the same initials on, but
it’s too dirty to show your Worship,” he
added, apologetically. The police thereupon
requested that the case be struck out.
* * * *
“Asta Rusque”: Few members of the first
naval and military expedition to German
New Guinea will forget a morning when
they were drawn up in hollow square to
witness the administering of corporal punish-
ment to half a dozen Germans. Their offence
was that they had beaten a missionary with
canes. All natives were confined to their
quarters while punishment was being ad-
ministered. General Holmes, in a prelimi-
nary speech, mentioned that a petition had
been handed him by the German residents
pointing out that he was, in his contem-
plated action, about to insult the flag of the
Fatherland. With a wave of his hand at the
Union Jack. Holmes reminded such of the
petitioners as were present—they all walked
off before the flogging began—that the British
flag had already been insulted by the act of
the accused ones. The culprits were led out one
at a time, examined by the M.O. and fastened
over the oval top of a Saratoga trunk. They
took their medicine without a whimper, the
canes used being similar to those with which
they themselves had operated.

"Eureka” : “Carisbrook, .Tun.” states that
he listened-in to 2BL‘s re-broadcast of 2LO,
London, and heard London’s Big Ben chime
the hour of six five minutes after Sydney’s
G.P.O. clock had boomed the hour of 4 a.m.
(B. 11/8/’27). I was within hearing dis-
tance of Sydney’s G.P.O. clock and also a
wireless set on that particular morning, and
the four strokes of the Sydney clock exactly
timed with the first four strokes of London's
7 a.m. The times of London and Syd-
ney differ by 10 hours, but the extra hour
is accounted for by the fact that a daylight-
saving law is in operation in London.

“The Rumpus”: Searching for a certain
Italian woodchopper on the Westralian gold-
fields, I came across a camp of his country-
men. “You looka for da Antonio?” said the
cook. “S’pose you wanta him for the gooda
thing—-all right; s’pose the bada thing
—look out! Antonio da stronga man, catcha
hold of the big fat policeman, sque-e-eeze—
huh, boy scout!” I must have looked as if
the metaphor impressed me, for he continued
in the same strain. “Huh! You don’ta
know Antonio. He da stronga man, I tella
you. He taka da half-crown, sque-e-eeze—
huh, traybit! You getta me? By da cripe,
don’t you maka da Antonio wild.” When I
found my man he proved to be almost the last
word in weediness.

“Uramao”: The most amazing combination
of callings that ever came within my pur-
view was managed by a person whose work-
ing hours were from about midnight to 8
a.m. Our town was only partly sewered at
the time and the first half of his labors were,
pursued “by the struggling moonbeam's
misty light or the lantern dimly burning.
Finishing that job, he donned the habiliments
of a milk-oh and went his rounds with the
rest. The first morning I saw him with the
milkeans was through the window while I
w r as shaving, and the shock was responsible
for a severe gash on m.v jaw. Nobody
grudged him his success when he had made
enough money by his double job to embark in
the second-hand furniture business.
"Kwinana” : One has to listen to the beam
station in Ballan (Vic.) to appreciate thi
dizzy speed at which it clatters. The other
night at 7.55 VIZ (Ballan) told GDII
(Grimsby, England) that he had 500 words
of press. GDI! immediately replied with
“G.A.” (“Go Ahead”). There was a short
unintelligible burst, and at 7.57 GDI! gave
“R. .o.k. It takes a telegraphist to appreci-
ate the despatch in less than two minutes of
what would take him 20 to 30 minutes to do
manually. Listening to the beam is almost
like listening to the drone of a bumble-bee,
with the exception of an occasional “new
tape” sent on the key at a readable speed.

“Cucliulain”: We can only guess at the
impulses that sway the somnambulist, but
memory must have much to do with them.
A lad returned from a North Coast (N.S.W.)
home to his school at Armidale, reaching
there about midnight. lie went to his dormi-
tory and to bed. Next morning he found
himself in another dormitory, a floor below
the one he retired in, in a bed he had occu-
pied four years before. His face and hands
showed that he must have sustained a ter-
rible fall. Another boy summoned the matron
and the matron called the doctors. The lad
was found to be badly hurt internally, but
he was quite conscious; he told his father,
who came in response to an urgent message,
that he had no recollection of being injured
until he woke. He died after an operation.
The father stated that he was aware the
boy had walked in his sleep.
“Marchese di Vermicelli” : Ben Mus-
solini’s decision to wipe out all Italian
titles save the comparatively few that
are actually listed in the Stud Book
will strike Yankeeland harder than
any outside country. For many years
one of Italy’s chief exports to the
United States has consisted of titled
husbands for American heiresses, who
thus acquired vicarious ennoblement.
Matters are further complicated by
the fact that in Italy the purchase of
an estate was often held to include the
purchase of the more or less shadowy
title pertaining thereto, and many a
sturdy Republican from across the
Atlantic has killed two birds with one
bag of dollars, as it were, ’by purchas-
ing a vineyard as a going concern with
some sort of prescriptive rank thrown
in. In any case, if the Duce persists
in his intention of wiping out pre-
tenders, whose numbers are said to
run into six figures, a lot of American
contesses will have no excuse to offer
for the husbands they have acquired,
and a whole horde of Dago near-noble-
men will have no visible reason for
their continued existence.

“Ess”: Our bush township didn’t
seem to be going ahead as fast as it
should, and finally a few enterprising
spirits met and formed a progress com-
mittee to boost things along. It was
agreed—secretly—that another baker,
another butchery and another store
were among our crying needs, as with-
out competition of any kind everyone
was at the mercy of the one-and-only’s.
The committee succeeded in inducing
another baker and a second butcher
to give the place a trial, and as these
were more reasonable than the whilom
monopolists they acquired about 50 p.c.
of the trade. But this wasn’t enough,
so, after a month’s struggle, they shut
up shop and drifted away. Then the
fun began. When the reformers and
those who had followed their lead went
back to the old shops, there being no
longer any choice, there was neither
bread nor meat for them. The baker
was only baking enough for regular cus-
tomers, and the butcher wasn’t killing
so much now, as the consumption had
slackened. This went on for three
weeks before the supporters of progress
were grudgingly wiped off the black
list. It was a case of shops boycotting
customers.

“Boronia” : The accordion dies hard
in the Outback. It was at a bush
darnce recently where the operator
failed to turn up. There was general
dismay, and it looked as if the func-
tion would have to be postponed ; but
two commercials who were putting in
the night at an adjacent pub heard of
the predicament and, digging up a
violin and a banjo, hastened to the ’all,
where they supplied some real dan'’"
melody for a few hours. I am still
wondering what they thought when the
M.C., who had worn a mournful ex-
pression all the evening, mentioned in
his closing remarks that he wished to
“apolergise for the music; the gentle-
man as generally plays slipped us up!”

“Jackpot”: It is just as well that
we should occasionally see oor flag as
ithers see it. Writing to the London
Times, Vice-Admiral Dumas complains
that, from a seaman’s point of view,
it “does not fulfil requirements, having
within it almost microscopical designs that
can certainly not be made out from afar.”
The Canadian flag, according to the old sea-
dog’s criticism, is open to much the same
objection.

“Basra”: The income-tax authorities have
been engaging in some drastic action at Mel-
bourne. Warrants were issued by a police-
magistrate on information sworn by the chief
investigation officer of the department; 18
police-constables and 20 officials acted on
them. They were accompanied by some
mechanics whose specialty is the opening of
safes and strongrooms when keys are not
available. Seven firms, 12 partnerships and
nine individuals were visited and loads of
documents impounded.
HIS MATE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“There’s only one straight cove I know as
always sticks to me,
A dinkum friend, a’ honest cove, as clean
as clean can be.
’E ain’t no fool, for, strike me pink, ’e
knows ’is way about,
An’ ’e is wise to worldly wiles —’e is without
a doubt.
“When I gets stuck for ’arf a quid ’e offs ’is
ragged coat
An’ sweats an’ grafts until ’e earns that
filthy ’arf a note.
’E doesn’t get a word of thanks; but ’e
don’t seem to care,
For when I ’its the rocks again, I’ll always
find ’im there.
“ ’E never nags when I go wrong, as many
cobbers do,
But cheers me up by sayin’ ‘Lad, there’s
others worse than you.’
’E never flings it up to me, that loan of
’arf a jim;
I reckon there’s no other chap in all the
world like ’im.
“ ’E’s been with me for forty years an’
never jarred at all
Or done a thing to make ’is mate look silly
or sing small.
’E’s white all through, ’an true an’ square,
’e’s all a mate can be;
’ls name? Well, Morrison’s ’s name—
Jim Morrison —that’s me.”

When she makes jam there is no need
Of sugar in the recipe.
While other cooks, perforce, must heed
(When she makes jam there is no need)
To use what flavoring’s agreed.
For ah, so honey-sweet is she
When she makes jam there is no need
Of sugar in the recipe!

The co. began the issue of debentures in
1915, when it got to work on its great iron
and steel enterprise; and the table shows
the money that has been swallowed up since
then. In addition to capital raised and
earnings put back into the business, a nice
lift was got in dark days, when lifts were not
easy to get, from the sale of the Pirie smelt-
ing works.
And it is not merely that the plant has
cost a pot of money ; it takes a -big handful
to carry on the business:—

On an investment of the size shown in the
first column you have to earn big money
merely to provide for replacements; actually
for the past year the amounts visibly set
aside for this purpose exceeded the dividends.
The balance from working accounts was
£685,941; but most of that went this way:—

Debenture interest .. 131,227 106,788 103,683
Income tax . . .. 59,760 65,893
And besides that £280,979 there was a
special £38.060 written off. Thus if the co.’s
mining and industrial enterprises had had
to carry the whole load last year, the net
profit would have been only £118,362; but
fortunately there was £161,127 available
from dividends, interest, etc., and a few
pounds from other sources. That £118,362
was all that was left to the co. from pro-
duction worth £4,687,004.

In the past 12 months the old Broken Hill
mine must have put a handy trifle into the
till, too; there should have been something
got out of the production of 19,672 tons lead
concentrates and 24,637 tons zinc con-
centrates at the very good prices which
ruled for most of the year. But metal values
are much lower now, and the Broken llill
mine can only be regarded as something to
be drawn on when conditions are peculiarly
favorable. They don’t promise to be for
some time ahead.
The financial position is easy:—
1924. 1926, 1927.

Excess liabilities £532,934
Liquid surplus .. £135,226 £279,667
The disappearance of those “excess liabili-
ties’’ and their replacement by “liquid sur-
plus’’ looks good on the surface. But it isn't.
It would be far better for Australia if the
co. had enjoyed so much success that it had
been encouraged to spend another million or
two in plant. As things are, the margin of
profit is so small that the co., having com-
pleted its works programme, has been con-
tent to make additions with great caution.

That big drop of £19,872 in last year’s net
profit was mainly the result of smaller crusli-
ings due to dry conditions in the Bundaberg
district. The export surplus was lower, and
chiefly because of that the season’s price
was about £5 better, averaging £24 10s. l()d.
per ton ; but the reduction in the quantity
of cane handled and the poorer sugar con-
tent meant higher overhead and other costs
per ton. The £51,784 netted last year was
equal to 10.3 p.c. of the paid capital of half
a million, compared with 14.5, 14.2, 9.6 and
14.2 p.c. back to 1923. However, partly
because the cane workers in the North are
playing up, the prospects for the southern
fields have improved, and the outlook is so
good that the board handed shareholders
only 2 p.c. less than it did a year ago. The
margin (£1784) sent to reserves was small,
but the latter are comfortably corpulent at
£186.829. Also the cautious management—
M. (4. Haymen, general manager of the
Q.N. Bank, is managing director—is not
likely to have failed to make adequate pro-
vision for contingencies before writing the
final figures.
Just as the year’s operations were com-
plete a fire destroyed part of the refinery
and most of the sugar and syrup stocks.
The lot was covered—luckily, for at the
time the damage was estimated at about
£200,000. Also luckily the chief profit-
earner, the raw milling plant, was undam-
aged, and most of the machinery destroyed
was about to be replaced with modern
types. These figures show the effect of the
tire and other changes:—

Liquid surplus .. £132,711 £151,763 £1,903
Stocks, of course, contracted substantially,
and book-debts were £28,815 lighter. Also
£63,539 was clipped off the outside debt,
reducing it to £122,383. The cash holding
was drawn upon for £120,158, and invest-
ments, which are not included with liquids in
the table, increased no less than £180,007,
mounting to £247,564, which is equal to
29.4 p.c. of the total assets. The nature
of the securities held is not disclosed, but
the co. has a substantial holding in the Bun-
daberg Distillery Co. The embargo on
foreign-grown sugar expires next year, but a
Government, which has protected the pro-
ducers of woollens and boots will no doubt
continue to grant protection to producers
of a line in which the threatened completion
is from countries employing cheap colored
labor.
Over the last 10 years shareholders have
received an average of 9.6 p.c. p.a.; and
£119.089, equal to 20 p.c. of the declared
net profits, went to reserves. After allowing
for the final div. net assets totalled 275. sd.
per share at June 30. The market prices the
scrip at 275., at which figure the return to
the invesor is a shade under 74 p.c. p.a.
on a 10 p.c. div. basis —the average div. for
the past five years has been just over 11 p.c.

Last year’s net profit was only £9GI more
man the previous year’s; nevertheless the
hoard handed an additional i p.c. (£1509)
: ' nit a s there was still
£10,94;) left for reserves the “Wild Cat”
doesn t accuse the directors of making the
pace too furious. Moreover, the £42,317 of
net profit shown may not, probably does not,
represent the full harvest. During the year
advances moved up no less than £54 007
compared with a growth of £7130 in the pre-
vious term; freehold, etc., on the other hand,
contracted £10.459. Apparently this means
that the co. has been successfully unloading
its subdivisions and making advances to pur-
chasers for building purposes; and that, of
course, is entirely a satisfactory movement-
under fair conditions it ensures a revenue for
some years to come. Balance-sheet figures
have moved in this way:—

Last year the debt increased £13,051
and reached £32,739. Most of it is held on
deposit; but there was more than enough in
Commonwealth bonds, cash and temporary in-
vestments to pay off all the creditors, who had
only Is. 3d. at risk in the business for every
£1 belonging to shareholders. The risk share-
holders run depends largely on things beyond
their control. They can’t say how long the
borrowing and importing boom will last or
what will be the manner of its death. It
may collapse with a bang, or the hot-air may
just leak away—the banks even now are
letting a little of the gas out. If there is a
sudden collapse, then this co.’s shareholders
will have to go hungry for a while. Nothing
worse can happen, however, so long as it re-
fuses to go into debt. If the gas just leaks
out the co. will simply go on making profits
on a smaller scale.
During the 10 years to 1920 reserves were
dipped into seven times and £247.266 of bonus
serin was handed out. The last lot (£78,277)
came from inner reserves —provision made for
that collapse, slow or sudden, which every
well-managed concern of the sort must pre-
pare for. Presumably similar provision has
been made out of more recent profits ; and this
will, of course, simplify the continued pay-
ment of dividends even under adverse con-
ditions. Net visible earnings in the last
seven years total £270,042, of which only
two-thirds has been distributed; the balance
(£90,174) increased the pile of visible sav-
ings to just a shade under 59 p.c. of paid
capital. So total funds have now to earn
only a fraction over 6 p.c. to pay a 10 p.c.
div. At June 30 net assets amounted to
31s. 9d. per £1 of paid capital. The market,
confident that the 10 p.c. distributions will
continue, tacks on another Is. 3d. for pros-
pects and gives 335. for the fully-paids. At
that figure the return to the investor is 6
p.c. p.a. on the basis of last year’s div.

*Divs. paid on face value of scrip and excess over

This business was established by Samuel
Allen in Townsville over half a century
ago. It was mainly a family concern till
1923. when, most of the sons of the original
Samuel having died, the public became inter-
ested in an issue of 64,122 £1 8 p.c. prefs. In
1920 a half-million ords., paid to 10s. each,
replaced a quarter-million fully-paids, and
up till 1924 divs. were paid on the face value
of the scrip. Any excess over 5 p.c. in the
rate declared went to reduce, the amount
unpaid on the ords. : that resulted in the
capitalisation of £75.000 of profit, equal to
3s. per share, over the five years. However,
the strain on earnings was too severe- and
to reduce it the 500,000 ords., 13s. paid
were converted into 325,000 £1 fully-paids
—that was in 1925. Reserves were thereby
given a chance to accumulate. To finance
further expansion 100,000 8 p.c. 2nd prefs.
were offered in the same year; thus paid
capital was increased to £512,000 in 100,000
Ist prefs., a like number of seconds and
325,000 ords. at June 30. There was then
£13,000 to come in on the 2nd prefs. Prefs.,
by the way, are not preferential as to capital •
that is to say, they wouldn’t come in first on
a distribution of assets.
The £50,213 netted last year was equal to
J.B p.c. of paid capital compared with 9.7,
8.5, 10.5 and 10.4 p.c. back to 1923. The
divs. called for 87.9 p.c. of the year’s net
earnings, and the balance (£6043), together
with £lO,OOO from inner reserves, brought
the visible lay-by to £16,043, which is a
mere 3.1 p.c. of paid capital. Goodwill—it
first appeared at x 40,000 in 1912 —was writ-
ten out of the books in 1926. Balance-sheet
figures have shown marked expansion over
the last five years :
_ , , 1922. 1920. 1927.
Paid capital .. £287,500 £508,745 £512,000

At .Tune 30 there was £507,687 in
stocks and book debts (the latter, by the
way, including secured advances and
accounting for 51.5 p.c. of the total assets)
to meet outside liabilities totalling £253.835.
No mention is made of provision for bad or
doubtful debts; but the board, which has
graduated in the business, knows the risks.
And it is pretty good proof of the quality of
past management that nearly all the present
ord. capital has come out of profits. The
£3255 of new- capital that came in during
the year and the £24.316 added to the over-
draft all went to finance clients, who owed
£28,355 more; and stocks were £6572
heavier. Freeholds are very substantial, but
at the last valuation w-ere worth a good
deal more than book value. The Brisbane
branch, opened in 1919, is being re-organised
oil the lines of the co.’s Sydney and Mel-
bourne businesses —largely indenting. The
position would be more comfortable if the
liabilities were less.
The ords. do not often appeal- on the mar-
ket. Pref. rights are, as said above, limited
to the 8 p.c. div.; last year’s net profit was
over three times total pref. requirements.
The net tangible backing for all classes at
June 30 amounted to 20s. 7d. per £l.
For the Ist prefs. buyers at 19s. (id. fail
to. attract sellers. The return at that
price is a shade over 8 p.c.; but it has to
be an extra good security that more than 8 p.c.
isn’t asked for in North Queensland. Why,
isn’t obvious ; there are no greater risks there
now- than in most parts of Australia. The
fact seems to be that money is more plenti-
ful up that way than anywhere else in Aus-
tralia, perhaps, and 10 p.c. looks no better
there than 7 p.c. does in places that are a
great deal poorer.

Standard Portland Cement Co.—This
is the co. which started off with a N.S.W.
Government contract for 150,000 tons of
cement on condition that it was “owmed and
controlled separately from and in no way
associated with or an adjunct of any other
c 0.,” the intent being to establish “an inde-
pendent competitor in the manufacture and
supplying of cement in N. S. Wales.” The
Government undertook to be a customer for
50,000 tons a year for three years at
£2 17s. 6d. per ton without bags at the
kilns, and works with a capacity of 100,000
tons p.a. were planned. Wage increases are
to be added to the £2 17s. 6d. under the
Government contract. Deliveries were begun
in January of this year. Two units have
been provided at the works, which are on
the Mudgee line, 152 miles from Sydney; and
contracts have been made, the directors
report, which will keep the entire plant
busy this financial year (to June, 1928).
As up to June, 1927, only one unit was
operated, and that for but part of the term,
financial results for the year cannot be taken
as a guide to the future. Nevertheless, with
the aid of £3601 from land sales, a trading
profit of £13.649 is shown on the capital of
£466,691. This profit is employed as follows:
Depreciation. £6700; preliminary exes,
written off, £4269 ; balance forward. £6BO. Pre-
liminary exes, amounted to £21,343. and the
directors’ purpose is to write off the lot in
three years from January 1, 1927. The fly
in the ointment is the unexpectedly heavy
cost of the equipment; the result is that
the co. owes £169,248 outside, part of it,
however, not payable till 1930 —this in
respect of plant. As the prospectus was
dated April. 1925, the co. has got to work
very briskly; the reports on which it got
its capital were both solid and enticing;
and the apportionment of the year’s quite
satisfactory profit suggests that the board
is solid, too.

Geophysical prospecting has lately come
into prominence in this country, and some
highly-placed Australian mining engineers
are keenly interested. But unless some action
is taken at once by Authority charlatans will
weave wondrous stories and fleece, the public
with promises of mineral wealth and oii
disclosed by the new method. There are
signs that this kind of swindle may soon be
tried, and it is up to the Federal Govern-
ment to take a hand and keep the fakir in
his place.

The noisiest section of Broken Hill union
leaders are telling the men that this talk of
shutting down mines is “merely propa-
ganda.” Shareholders wish it was. But
with lead fallen from. £32 3s. 6d. to £22 7s.
6d., zinc from £34 Is. 3d. to £27 11s. 3d.
and silver from 2s. 5 l-16d. to 2s. l£d.,
all inside 12 months, they know it isn’t.
=i= * * *
A water-shortage scare is being worked
up at Broken Hill. There is nothing in it.
The supplies at both Stephens Greek and
Ilmberumberka are good, in spite of a dry
year. The scare is merely part of a plan
to get the Darling River scheme put in
hand to absorb the men whom the smashing
fall in metals will throw out of work.
s|t * * *
Latest from the R.O.G. at Roma (Q.)
is that the water has been successfully shut
off down to 3550 ft. Boring has just been re-
started, and another 150 ft. will bring it to
the level of the gas horizons in past bores.
Nothing short of a miracle can stop them
getting the gas pool, but the few hundred
feet below this is the real thing aimed at—
it has never yet been accomplished. Roma
bores are the only ones in the artesian
basin that have produced wet gas with
ethane and the higher paraffins; and, taking
the normal zoning of wet gas and petroleum
in established fields abroad, it is more than
desirable that a competent test down to
4000 ft. should be carried out with all ad-
ditional w-ater shut off. For the first time
in Roma's chequered oil career this looks
like being accomplished.
* * * *
The big mother lode at Ravenswood
(N.Q.) has had a crushing from the 70ft.
level. For a lode measured in yards rather
than feel results were very satisfactory, as
96 tons produced 520 z., or a shade over
10dw T t. ore. As this was not picked, but
an average of the ore on the level, more
capital will be sought for additional plant in
order to reduce costs by bigger tonnages.
It is expected that 6dwt. stuff will pay.
* * * *
Although Mt. Elliott, Ltd., closed down
its experimental leaching plant at Cloncurry
recently, it is going on with boring investi-
gations into the so-called “porphyry” de-
posits. Two drillers have been imported
from U.S.A., and a Sanderson cyclone churn
drill is now making holes. Assays of every
sft. of sludge will be made. 11. S. Mackay,
who put up the plaut and claims to know the
principal copper-bearing porphyries of
C.S.A., considers those of the Cloncurry
district of identical character and probably
of higher grade than the average American.
Samples from pits ranged from 24 to 7 p.c.
copper. Most of the 11.5. A. range from 1
to 2 p.c. The first bores are intended to
be scouts, and when the form of the deposit
is defined it will be close-bored.
* * * *
Kunwarara Magnesite Syndicate, operat-
ing on the Queensland North Coast line,
hopes to bring in another new industry to
North Australia. The mineral occurs here
as crystals or in white compact masses.
It is principally used for lining furnaces
where great heat has to be resisted, but
there are many minor uses as well as by-
products. Supplies have mainly come from
the U.S.A. hitherto.
* * * *
Mt. Nolan tin-mine, Silver Valley, Herb-
erton (N.Q.), is raising good ore, the last
crushing of 90 tons realising nearly 6 tons
of cones. A further tonnage is at grass
estimated to carry at least 8 p.c. More capi-
tal could be used here with advantage, as the
lode looks strong and capable of considerable
development, and additional pumping plant
is necessary to cope with the umter.

From Arthur Clarke (Cairns) :
Re Palmer River Dredging Co.’s machinery. This
is to go, not by way of PalmerviUe, but by a
direct northern route from Laura to' Strathleven,
a distance of 90 miles—a much easier track. General-
manager Baker has inspected it, and reckons it
won’t cost more than £5OO to put it in order to
carry the machinery. The only heavy piece is a G-
ton boiler; the balance can be easily conveyed on
3-ton or 5-ton lorries, and 6-ton and 12-ton lorries
will not be required, as stated in “Wild Cat,”
28/7/’27. Numerous applications have already been
received from lorry-owners willing to transport the
plant.
The start of dredging depends entirely on finance;
if the 10,000 cum. 10 p.c. prefs. about to be
issued to the public (the balance of the 22,000
offered last year, and which were withdrawn after
12,000 had been applied for, as it was expected
financial support would be received from the Mines
Department) are quickly subscribed, operations maj'
start at the end of this or early next yeUr, as the
pontoons are ready for shipment from Melbourne.
The co.’s calling power is limited to Is. per month;
and, although it can call a further £12,000 at
this rate, it would take 18 months to get it all in.
Ilence the further issue of 10,000 prefs. to lmrry
things along.

Frency Oil Co. (W.A.) again expresses
satisfaction with geological indications, but
there is still no oil. Balance-sheet at .Tune
30 last shows cash £3194, and plant valued
at £15,807, but worth old-iron prices if the
co. gave up.
* * * *
South Kalgurli, despite yarns to the con-
trary, is not adverse to amalgamating its
interests with those of its neighbors. The
directors are ready to adopt a scheme likely
to benefit their own and other mines.
* * # *
Cash subscribed, £60,000, with a good deal
more, has gone in development and experi-
mental work in connection with proposed
treatment processes at Wiluna (W.A.). The
treatment plant remains to be installed, and
by the time all is ready for the first run
something like £300,000 will have been ex-
pended. Fuel has also to be provided for.
Altogether a big job.
A good many Great Bcfulder (W.A.) tri-
butors are doing remarkably well, and could
do better if they could get their ore promptly
treated. They are backing their expressions
of faith in the mine, too, by buying thou-
sands of shares at about Is. So far they
have had no trouble in buying, as someone
has a tap turned on.
* * * *
Adelaide seems to have struck a lame duck
in New Wiluna, a float-off from the Golden
Token Syndicate. The public does not want
the shares, and developments disclosed to a
depth of 50 feet support its judgment. To
that depth nothing of value has been dis-
closed.
* * # *
McCahon’s Co. has secured an option over
the flooded Edna -May Consolidated at Wes-
tonia —the water is up to the 110 ft. level.
There is approximately 5000 tons of payable
ore in sight above that level, with the possi-
bility of further patches; but this isn't
enough to show much profit over the pur-
chase price. There is, however, a chance
of a parallel ore body being located.
* * * *
As a result of a motor trip to Bremer
Ranges, Dundas goldfield (W.A.), Inspector
of Mines Rockett is sooling prospectors on
to that locality. Certainly the structure is
favorable, but prospectors have been making
flying trips to the district for a quarter of a
century with poor luck. It is inaccessible
and lacks water, too.
* * * *
Paringa Co., of W.A. and elsewhere, has
issued another lean report. Receipts, de-
rived solely from interest, dividends arid
profit on shares sold, were £1056; expendi-
ture, £1674. There is £1063 in cash left,
and investments that cost £11,481 are now-
valued at £5593. Holdings comprise a mine
on tribute at Kalgoorlie, an interest in a
Bolivian rubber-trading co., and shares in a
syndicate “controlling large deposits of brown
coal at Morwell (Vic.).” It used to talk
about a Rhodesian golden quarry in which it
had an interest, but this time is silent about
that venture.
*-* * $
Monte Carlo co. has secured a further ex-
tension of its option on Glenelg Hills
(W.A.). The previous extension was ob-
tained in April last, when the co. agreed
to pay the vendors £5500 in three instalments
over nine months. The first instalment of
£l5OO has been met, and in consideration
of agreeing to the co.’s request for more
time, the vendors are to receive an additional
£2OO or £3OO and 6000 paid shares.
* * * *
The Marranboy Co.’s 20-head plant should
reach Darwin early this month; it can be
transhipped direct into trucks and railed to
Katherine. The co. has sent with it a
3-ton International truck, and this, with
the co.’s traction-engine and trailer (15
tons a trip), will transport the plant to
Marranboy. It is expected to have 10 head
working by the end of the year, and the
other 10 head will be added as quickly as
possible. The contractors for 1000 tons
of ore have delivered 790 tons, which has
averaged 2j per cent, tin, the last 80 tons
returning 3.62 per cent; the balance of
210 tons is expected to equal the last 80
tons, as the lode in the bottom of the open
cut at 90 feet carries very good values over
a width of about 15 feet. The issue of
15.000 pref. 10 p.c. shares, of which 7500 were
taken up by the old holders, was supported
sufficiently well to finance the mill. Suction-
gas and electricity will be the motive power.
William Bale, of iSydney, designed the
plant.
“Black Tracker” : A find of opal of good
quality has been made about 20 miles from
Coober Pedy opal fields, in the south-west
of South Australia. A party of prospectors
had purchased an old motor-’bus and started
out to inspect some distant country. When
about 20 miles out they had engine trouble,
which compelled them to camp while one of
them went for assistance. While nosing
around the party discovered a patch, which
led on to the find. It has been named tin 1
Twenty Mile.

Latest report from Lakes Entrance oil
well at Gippsland (Vic.) states that a “most
regrettable incident” occurred —the sort of
accident which happens far too frequently
during the search for oil in Australia. After
the core of the drill from 1218 feet had been
analysed by the chief chemist to the Vic.
Mines Department, lie reported “a small
percentage of a dark reddish-brown petro-
liferous oil.” The core was split in two,
lengthwise and crushed. The inner part
gave 0.36 p.c. of mineral oil, and the outer
0.39 p.c. Then the customary phenomenon
happened—a clamp in the drilling rig fell
out, or came out, or was pushed out, or
simply sneaked out for a rest, and tools
went to the bottom of the six-inch borehole.

In the 12 months New Oswald, Maldon
(Vic.), has crushed 3466 tons for 17350 z.;
about lOdwt. a ton. Cyanide gave 7090 z.
and plates 650 z., while concentrates sold for
£1242 net. Tributors mined 26 tons for
350 z. Gold from all sources, £11,190. Wages
ate £6572, or 58 per cent, of total receipts
—which is why the old mine doesn't pay divs.
The mine stands in the books at £1.0,500,
which in old Bob Oswald's heyday was about
a fortnight’s gold yield.

Cock’s Pioneer (Vic.) has 120,000 shares
paid to £1 and has given £60,000 in divs.
Last half-year (to May 31) it lost £3593,
although it produced £4lOO of gold and
holds tin worth £2176. In six months
244,700 c.y. were treated, including over-
burden, for lOlloz. gold and 11.7 tons of
tin ; the gold averaged 3.97 d. a cubic yard
and the tin concentrates 2.13 d., or 6.1 d. per
yard. Now that so much overburden has
been removed there niay be better times
ahead. The figures for development stand
at £84,204, and for plant and building

T. Kilroy and party, three all told, who are
working a small quartz show at Bolinda
Vale, only 20 miles as the crow flies from
Melbourne, had another lot (the fourth)
crushed the other day at Queenstown battery.
From 154 tons a cake of 1370 z. resulted,
and the ingot was shown to the Minister
for Mines. To enable the owners to de-
velop tl*e claim (the shaft is down 47ft.
with a short drive) Kilroy has asked for
£lOOO advance from the Mines Department.
It will be inquired into.
Oriomo Oil Co., Papua, has already
conveyed hundreds of tons of gear and
general supplies from its Daru depot to
boring sites 30 miles up-river. Though there
are shallowish channels entering Daru road-
stead. these could easily be made safe for
the deepest craft; and seeing that they open
right into Torres Strait, and Thursday
Island is but 120 miles away, there could
scarcely be a handier situation for an oil
concern.

Austral Asiatic is out with its first float,
Muang Tin, a Western Siamese proposition.
Nominal capital is £150,000 in £1 shares—-
20,000 to be allotted to Asiatic Tin, which
also takes £20,000 cash. The co. is offering
80,000 cumulative 74 p.c. pref. shares, which
are to come in with ordinaries for any divi-
dend beyond that. Thirty thousand of these
have been disposed of in Penang (F.M.S.),
which may be taken as an indication of
what local folk think of the show. Or if
not of the show, at least of the chance of
getting out at a profit. The balance of the
issue—it has been underwritten—is being
offered in the first instance to Austral
Asiatic shareholders; any shares not taken
up by them are to be at the disposal of
the underwriters. Joseph Tomlinson, chair-
man of directors, has made a good beginning
with A.A.’s first flotation, and his success
in getting the whole issue underwritten in.
the present rather sullen condition of the
Eastern Tin stock market is worth three
cheers from shareholders. The property
comprises a dredgable area of about 379
acres near Ban Nasan, on the Penang-Ban-
kok railway. It has been thoroughly bored in
three-chain squares by the co.’s field engineer,
A. C. S. McLeod. He values the whole area
at 0.8931 b. of 70 p.c. tin oxide. The ground
is easy, and a bucket dredge of 80,000 c.y.
per month capacity should return a monthly
31 tons or more. ,
Rawang reports a net profit of £172,000
for the year, as compared with £32,867 for
the previous year. Much of the increase is.
however, due to the inclusion in P. and L. of
shares in Rawang Concessions, a subsidiary
recently floated and valued at £45,000, par.’
There was also a profit on sales of shares in
the same co. which amounted to £22,500.
So actual profit pans out about £lOO.OOO, and
as Kawang’s capital is £240,000, that
amounts to about Ss. a share. Four shillings
of it has been paid in dividends, and the
reserves are in keeping with the co.’s repu-
tation for conservative management. Never-
theless, there is reason to suppose that the
Rawang dredge has come near exhausting the
pick of its ground, and that the sluicing
plant is in the same case. Rawang Con-
eesssions may carry on the old tradition. A
quotation of 435. for the £1 shares seoins
optimistic.

Australian industry lost a good friend
when R. M. Oakley, head of the Customs!,
and for some time also chairman of the
Tariff Board, died suddenly in Melbourne.
Three years ago Fred Holden, founder of the
Holden motor body works, which in the
past year had a turnover of nearly three
millions, told The Bulletin that Oakley
was the man in the department who had
been able to visualise the possibilities of the
industry, and who had helped him most to
get the protection the Bank of Adelaide re-
quired before it advanced the money for
the start in a big way. Born at Warrnam-
bool in 1871, he died much too soon at 56.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : The Hon. Anne Judith
Denman, younger child of Australia’s ex-
G.-G. Lord Denman, is at Newnham—the
only girl student of engineering in that
great seat of learning. Engineering, by the
way, is quite a usual profession for women
in Sweden. The Denman heiress is 20,
pretty and vivacious. Her brother Tom,
who recently came of age, promises to follow
the busy and useful lines which his parents
have favored. In Australia Lord Denman
was fond of telling a story against himself.
As a young man, when he first stood for
the House of Commons, he was addressing
a public meeting in the Midlands. After
a series of faltering preliminaries and dis-
turbing interrogatories he said: “And now
I shall ask myself a question.” “And a
damn silly answer you’ll get,” was the re-
tort from a rude member of the audience.
Speaker Snowball (Vic.), whose business
it is to suppress interjections, got in one him-
self the other day. For the moment the
member for Brighton got the better of the
Speaker. When a member asked how much
Brighton would have to pay in extra rates
to provide its share of the cost of the
Spencer-street bridge, “Snowy” retorted to
an amused House : “Brighton is not squeal-
ing.” While F. C. Mason was Assembly
Chairman of Committees he was speaking
one night 32 years ago as a private member
from his place in the Ministerial corner.
Upon being interrupted he frowned and
called out “Order!” Then he joined in the
laugh against himself.
Jim Dooley, beaten for the A.L.P. selection
at Hartley, passes himself out of politics
as complacently as he passed himself in. The
fact that he hasn’t to go back to a miner’s
pick or a laborer’s hod probably assists to a
philosophic acceptance of defeat rare in
these turbulent party days. Dooley is a
tailor by trade, but should have been a law-
yer. The Laborites have deprived themselves
of a big part of their logical debating
strength in passing him out. He had been
only a couple of years in Litligow when his
interest in Labor got him his political
reward.
E. Kidson, who succeeds D. C. Bates at
the Meteorological Office in Wellington
(M.L.), is an Englishman by birth and a
Maorilander by education. The new director
is a graduate of Canterbury College, and
his talents as a climatologist got him a job
with the Carnegie Institute, which told him
to go and study Australia. He traversed the
continent many times on the back of a
camel. The Big Scrap took him to Salonica,
where he served with the Royal Engineers.
After that he had charge of the magnetic
observatory at Watteroo (W.A.). and for
four years he has been assistant-director of
the Commonwealth Meteorological Office 1 .
He is one of the few Doctors of Science
turned out by the Canterbury College.
Stan Argyle will replace ex-Attorney-
General Eggleston on Melbourne Uni. Coun-
cil as a representative of the non-Labor
section in Vic Assembly. The doc.’s report
on his whirl around hospitals in Yankeeland
and Canada was disappointing. It was to a
large extent a record of impressions. Hos-
pital committees and staffs may be interested
and may be envious of the dollar-scatterers
who build and endow the institutions which
illustrate the report. But because of Ar-
g.vle’s three years’ Cabinet experience some-
thing more valuable was expected.
Old Clobs, historic identity of the King’s
School, where he. was drill-sergeant from
1882 until he retired in 11)17, has passed on.
E. P. Lindsay i herited his nickname from
a predecessor who considered “swingin’ the
clobs” good medicine for refractory boys.
Although a strict disciplinarian Clobs had
his kindly side, and was popular amongst
the thousands of boys who went tlirousrh his
hands. J. H. Abbott has mentioned him in
several stories.
This year’s crop of Rhodes scholars leaves
for Oxford on the Commonwealth liner Es-
perance Bay. Including a Maorilander they
number six. Two arc from Melbourne Uni-
versity, N. S. Bayliss of Queen’s College
and F. K. S. Hirschfeld of Trinity, Hirsch-
feld, whose family is well known in Bris-
bane, bears the Bananaland scholarship.
Brisbane Grammar and Uni. claim most of
his career. Bayliss and Hirschfeld have
inter-Varsity sculls nailed over the family
mantelpieces. Both will go to New College.
Jack Sloan, who was almost as well
known as his friend Alec Peacock, has taken
the long road. Latterly Jack was auction-
eer as well as agent. He was everybody's
neighbor, and was one of the best-known
A.N.A. men in Vic. A friendly soul, he got
a good deal of fun out of his innings of
three-score years.
Unlike Andrew Fisher, who has chosen
Scotland as the home of his retirement, Joe
Cook, having finished his term as High Com-
missioner, is coming back to Australia, where
10 good Australians —nine sons and a daugb-
ter —anchor him. Cook, who is now _67
years old, arrived in Litligow as a miner
in 1885. Taking an active part in the Repub-
lican, Single Tax and Labor agitation of the
time he got office in the local branch of the
Miners’ Association, from which he stepped
into Parliament with the first official Labor-
it< s in 1891. He split from Labor over the
solidarity pledge. A portfolio as P.M.G.
brought him over to George Reid. There-
after he wore a political coat of many colors,
achieving for a while the highest office in
the Commonwealth.
The cable which tells of the production
of a modernised version of the Old Testa-
ment recalls that a Nineteenth Century New
Testament was produced in England in the
’nineties. The job was undertaken by a
group of Hebrew scholars, mostly of Cam-
bridge, and Hampden Cook, a Congregation-
alist, returned from his church- at Broken
Hill to join in the work. It was better
English than the Chicago experiment seems
to be; but it was soon forgotten.
Among the candidates for the coming
N.S.W. elections are a couple of inedieoes—
Dr. Arthur, the National certainty for Mos-
man, and Dr. J. E. Webb, Chief Secretary
Gosling’s opponent at Oatley. Nurse Francis
is the A.L.P. nominee at Bondi, J. McGirr,
Labor aspirant at Bankstown, is a. quali-
fied chemist, and there are a couple of
parsons (Riley, Tumberumba, and Gray,
Drummoyne) in the field. The nomination
of an undertaker would complete the circle.
The House hasn’t had a conspicuous under-
taker since Jabez Wright’s day. The most
famous it ever had was Ninian Melville,
long time Chairman of Committees.
When, after years of retirement in Vic-
toria, an 81-year-old ex-fossicker, J. Rowan,
made the trip to Ivalgoorlie to take part in
the “Back to the Goldfields” Carnival, for-
tune laughed out loud. Pottering about the
old claims he knew at the Six Mile he un-
earthed a nugget weighing 260 z. 14dwt.
“Hop’s” old friends and admirers may
like to have something of his that they may
put on the wall. The Bulletin’s _ Service
Department has taken the matter in hand
and will, on request, forward a copy of
“The Roll Call,” “I Thought I Had a
Stamp” or “The Flowing Bowl,” beautifully
printed on art paper. No charge will be
made for the print; but 4d. in stamps is
to be sent to the Service Department, Bulle-
tin Office, Sydney, to pay for packing and
postage, and the ordinary Service coupon
(printed inside back cover) is to accompany
the request.
“HOP.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Never a page shall leap to life again
Limned with his art or lighted with his
wit,
A-gleam with fancies from his fertile brain,
Quaint fantasies across the years to Hit
Like sunbeams through the gloom. The path
he chose
Was ranged from base to summit. Now he
goes
Into the Infinite.
The masters of the pencil and the brush,
Aye, and all else, are taken one by one.
Folded the quick deft hands. In solemn hush
The curtain falls; the earthly play is done.
Write above all the tributes to his worth:
lie used his gift for gaiety and mirth,
Searing or scathing noiie.
Gone the tall figure. Stilled the step that
fell
Slower from year to year upon the stair.
What memories, above the craftsman’s spell.
The artist’s wizardry, shall linger there!
The tears will pass for him who left the
smiles
Among the pages of the close-packed files,
Around the Empty Chair.

■ SATURDAY NIGHT.
[Fon The Bulletin.]
It's good to be out on a station, when you’re
young, and it’s Saturday night,
With a brand-new tie, and your Sunday boats,
and a girl on your arm in white ;
When down in the shepherds’ whare they
have planed and powdered the floor,
And set some benches along the wall, and a
mirror behind the door;
And the lacquered tin lamp is competing with
a bottomless Ilennessy’s prime,
Then it’s twenty to nine by the cook-house
clock, so it’s eight by the station time.
And it’s “Gentlemen, take your partners,”
and you saunter to the right,
And please don't sit through the promenade
if you wish for a rollicking night.
Just sway to the old accordion, for Joe's at
the top of his form,
And each of the windows is open, so don’t
be afraid to get warm.
There’s a bracket high up in the corner, you
can look at the clock if you climb,
When it’s five past ten by its old Swiss face,
then it’s nine by the station time.
There are coffee and rolls and cakes galore,
abundance and more to spare,
And please drop the pannikins down by the
step, there’s a dress-basket handy there.
We’ve the Supper Waltz then, by the shep-
herd out back, on his supple-jack station
kazoo,
It’s “After the Ball” or “Polly” or “Nile”
or “A Bicycle Built for Two.”
And we mustn’t forget what the old folk said,
let’s finish by midnight’s chime,
It is forty to twelve by the cook-house clock,
and eleven by station time.
Then comes the witching “Danube,” and
smoothly on we glide,
And the flaring lamp and the candle move to
the thrill of its magic tide,
And the grey dawn pierces softly the thick
smoke-laden pall,
As the haunting “Slave’s Lament” rings out
in the last dear dance of all,
And Azrael places the white gloves down by
the great tome marked for crime,
Though it’s after two by the cook-house clock,
and it’s five by the station time.
MAORTLAND. MARY WALKER.
“Sea Nomad'': Thursday Island is the place
for electric torches. Only seven of the white
inhabitants are without them; the majority
sport two or three. The unlighted town and
the dark hill paths by night, after a picture-
show, seem to be dotted with giant fire-
flies. Islanders and New Guinea boys
employed on the shelling fleets greatly covet
these torches and spend their salt-encrusted
wealth in taking a flashing treasure home
to their brethren; at many a village dance
the star performer is now outlined by an
electric flashlight, instead of by the time-
honored pandanus torch. When the batter-
ies run out loud is the moaning in the
villages. One grizzled old cannibal com-
plained to me: “This feller he no like sun,
he go out altogether. Me fill 'im longa
kerosene, him no light. Dam’ sulky feller
this one.”
* * * *
“Con Drew" : Years ago on Texas station
(Q.) I gave an abo. a stick of tobacco in
exchange for information regarding the
method of tracking bulls when they wandered
away with the mob. Binghi contended that
a bull’s habit of pawing the ground causes
the hoof to wear to the shape of a saddle
dee, and his track can thus be easily dis-
tinguished. A working bullock's track is
somewhat similar, owing to the wear and
tear of Strawberry’s toes when straining
under the yoke; but in Strawberry’s cdse
the toes arc bent upwards and do not wear
off like the bull’s. Another sure sign that
a bull lias passed along is the presence
of mutilated shrubs from the animal’s habit
of horning the tufts of undergrowth.
❖ ❖ ❖
“Pfella” : Wayfarers looking for a tree to
doss under (B. 28/7/’27) would suffer from
eye-strain in some portions of Groperland’s
vast nor’-west. There the deepest rut in
the road is considered the softest bed. Three
inches of fine, red dust under your lay-out
is better than a kapok mattress. Some, how-
ever, prefer a sandy, dry river-course. They
scoop out places for their bony parts, spread
their swags and let the galahs wake them at
dawn. But the fastidious footslogger in
these lonely regions will tramp on for miles
to reach a spinifex clump. A six-foot forked
stick jabbed under each plant severs its stem,
and when a number of these bushes have
been turned over and jambed together even
Hans Andersen’s princess would wake radi-
ant after a night’s camp on top.
* * * *
“Echoe”: Any zoologist could name a
score of differences between alligators and
crocodiles, some of them greater than those
pointed out by “Baja” (B. 4/8/’27). A 25ft.
crocodile is no curiosity, but a 13ft. alligator
has yet to be found. In Florida, U.S.A., where
’gators are bred for their skins, the largest
ever stripped of his suit measured just over
12ft. The ’gator moves his bottom jaw; the
croc, his top jaw. The croc, has a three-
chambered heart; the alligator a two-
chambered one. This proves that the croc,
is a much older creature than the ’gator, and
has progressed further along the line of
evolution.
THE COMFORTER.
NEIGHBOR (to lady who is being lumbered): “Go along with the gentleman, dearie;
he’ll give you a nice cup of tea when you get there.”
“E.S.S.”: Menindie, on the Darling, has
been a watering-place for outbackers ever
since the first white man went into “the cor-
ner.” It was the outpost of civilisation whence
TYPOGRAPHICAL.
DINER: “Waiter, there’s a button in my soup.”
WAITER (an ex-printer): “Ah, mere typographical error, sir—it should be mutton.”
Burke and Wills set out on their tragic
expedition ; and now that there is a through
train from Sydney via the old depot to
Broken Ilill, it is expected that the sandy
hamlet will sparkle up. It has known peri-
ods of wild, roystering days, with long inter-
vals of peace between. The greatest event
to the oldest inhabitants is the building of
a new house. Said one to me recently: “I
wouldn’t be surprised to see a house or two
go up now.” Bourke, too, had expectations
with the coming of the railway, but Bourke
withered. Menindie couldn’t wither with-
out disappearing.
* * * *
_ ‘‘Up North” : There has existed for centu-
ries among the Torres Strait islands a power-
ful secret society—the Bomai-
Malu cult. Of late years a
white man has now and then
been taken into the partial con-
fidence of the natives; but we
shall never fully understand the
inner workings of the groups
nor see the more important
parts of their ceremonies. A
missionary and a one-time'
schoolmaster at Murray Island
holds practically the civilised
world’s store of knowledge con-
cerning this secret society. It
has its varying degrees of mem-
bership, is strictly and effi-
ciently controlled, and across
one line of islands its dictates
are law to over 3000 people.
By means unknown to us, and
also by hand-grips, a twitch of
the eyes or lips and other signs,
members recognise one another,
and they can converse secretly
in the midst of a crowd of
strangers. For insignia the head-
men sport carvings of pearl,
nautilus and tortoise-shell; and
the dresses of office are finished
off in wildly barbaric fashion.
The sacred badges seem to re-
semble large diamonds and
rubies.
“Te. W.”: Lieut. Joshua Moore, the
earliest settler in the district which includes
Canberra, seems at some time to have pene-
trated still further afield. At any rate, two
small lakes near the main road from Cooma
to Bombala, on the recently dismembered
Bibbenluke station, are known as Joshua
Moore’s Lakes, while the part of the run
around them is called Waterloo.” Moore
was a Waterloo veteran. Another locality,
not far away, is known as Moore’s
Springs. The old warrior seems to have
added a slice of the Monaro country, then
in a wild state, to his Canberra holding,
which he obtained in 1823. Later on when
the vast Ben Boyd holdings on Monaro came
under the hammer, Ashton station, a few
miles to the south of Bombala, fell to a
buyer who never even saw it—Sir James
Mathieson, of the great Eastern firm of Jar-
dine, Mathieson and Co., whose mana is still
great in the cities of the war-torn Celestial
Empire.
“C. Coral”: The people of Southern
Papua have a legendary story of twins who
w T ere born back to back and performed many
extraordinary feats. Some of the early pearl-
shellers got hold of this and, not being
ethnologists, came to the conclusion that the
twins actually existed. They offered various
items of “trade” for the freaks with a view
to their transportation south for exhibition
purposes; so keen was competition that one
ship which called in at Somerset_ made a
straight-out offer of £2OO. The twins, how-
ever, were not forthcoming.
* * * *
“8.F.” : We were in a car that pulled up
midway between Jericho and Blackall in the
drought-stricken area of Central Q. The
water was sizzling from the radiator, to
the accompaniment of a strange musical
sound. We looked and found ten Australian
canaries trying to drink from the bubbles
that came out of the radiator. As we had
a long way to go we could not spare them
any water, so a member of the party formed
miniature troughs out of some brown paper
into which he poured horehound beer. In
,a twinkling the canaries gathered round and
drank to their heart’s content. We com-
pleted the treat by throwing them some
crumbs.
* * * *
“Kiwi” : A bullock team, a horse team and
a tractor were recently to be seen working
in adjacent paddocks at Caledonian Flats
("Vic.), a tiny settlement on the edge of the
Mallee. The sight was' probably unique in
the annals of Australian agriculture, but what
made the spectacle stranger still was the
fact that the bullocks worked four abreast.
The ploughman, an 18-year-old share farmer,
Jimmy Weatheritt, had made the harness
for his beasts, one of which he had bought
from a butcher for ss. The straightness
and uniform depth of the furrows woujd
have brought delight to the eye of any practi-
cal farmer. Behind the plough strutted the
lad’s constant companion, a big Rhode Island
red rooster, picking the titbits turned
up by the plough. Jimmy has also a single-
furrow plough of his own manufacture, with
which lie tills the home garden, the motive
power being supplied by a nanny-goat.
* # * *
“F. 5.11.”: The stem of the walking-stick
palm makes an unbeatable maul handle. The
palm is of the dwarf family, and grows
abundantly on the gravelly banks of coastal
ridge creeks in N. S. Wales. The stem ?s
dark green in color and is built in small
rings, one on top of the other. The •wood
is stringy and as tough as leather. The
rings do not blister the hands as might be
expected, and the pliability of the wood cuts
out jar and vibration when swinging the tool.
North Coast (N.S.W.) bullockies favor this
palm for whip handles also.

“Fana”: New Guinea has produced some
outsizes in gorgeously-colored butterflies. A
black and dark-blue variety captured near
Eitape, on the n.-w. coast of the Mandated
Territory a few months ago, made entomo-
logists marvel; when its wings were fully
extended they measured from tip to tip a

shade under 18in. The body was about 7in.
long and at the thickest part nearly 3in. in
circumference. A search was made for the
partner of this gorgeous thing, but it could
not be found.
“Rossy”: When Pierce, a locally famous
dogger and tracker, died at Moonpool Lake,
15 miles from the Murray, his wife and
daughter and an old black shepherd dug an
enormous square hole some distance from the
hut. To this they dragged the old iron
bedstead on which the dead man lay—he was
a 15-stoner —and lowered it in. Then, having
placed some food by the bed. they filled up
the grave. Pierce’s personal belongings were
next piled on the table in the hut, saddle,
bridle and spurs being tied together. The
women and old Jerry harnessed the horses
to the express waggon, loaded into it their
own clothing and effects, set fire to the hut
and drove to the station satisfied that the
debbil-dcbbils could do no harm now.

“Jimmy Possum” : The day they planted
Full Moon the station-manager met Toby
dodging lazily along with nulla-nulla and
boomerang, sucking at his well-blackened
clay. “What for you no go longa
Full Moon’s funeral?” the boss
demanded. Taking an extra long
draw, Toby blew a dense cloud of
smoke through his distended nos-
trils, a thoughtful expression on
his hairy black face. “What fo’
me bin go longa his fewnal?” he
grunted. “Him not go longa my
fewnal when I die.”
❖ *
“Yarri” : Bandy was a scheming
sundowner who carefully avoided
certain places on his old tracks.
One was a wayside pub on the
Maranoa, near which he had
pitched his tent one evening while
a number of shearers and urovers
were having a good time. In the
night he was burnt out. “Every-
think I owned —even a poun’-note
in me best pants pocket,” he said
dolefully to the crowd. They
passed round the hat and collected
a few pounds for him. Three days
afterwards, near another popular
pub, he was burnt out again. Some
of the drovers, having reached
there from the previous fire, paid
a visit to Bandy’s camp. In the
ruins they found the steel ribs
of a pair of stays, the remains of an old
bonnet, and other oddities evidently collected
from the rubbish-tip. Not far away they
fossicked out Bandy’s swag hidden in the
scrub. He left in a hurry.
“Simon”; The trial-marriage idea now
being championed in America is not new on
this side of the globe. On the little island
of Woodlark, a couple of hundred miles off
Port Moresby, the natives have practised it
for generations. If a couple can’t hit it
after three or four months they separate and
take another pick.
“Redraw”; According to “Herodot” (B.
4/8/’27), “no doe yet born has produced 14
babies in one consignment.” I have several
times found 14 belly-young in does. On one
occasion I counted 15 young rabbits in the
one nest. It was an outside nest, away
from the big bur-
row, so it is most
unlikely that two
does would use it.
All outside nests
are covered up
during the daytime
and visited only at
night.
UK NEEDN’T WORRY ABOUT THAT.
“My mother’ll kill me if I go fighting.”
“No, she won’t. There won’t be nothing left of yer to kill."
“Prop.”: The horizontal scrub of Tas-
mania’s West Coast (B. 4/8/’27) is a fool
to the fagis of Baru Bluff and the Pillion
tableland in the the same island. Fagis (the
only name I know it by) is a deciduous shrub
that grows in beds a mile or two long by a
quarter of a mile broad. The blizzards and
heavy snow that sweep down from the Cradle
Mountains have so twisted and entangled
the branches and twigs that, though it has
no thorns, it tears your clothes to pieces
should you be reduced to forcing a passage
through it.
* * * *
“Wandi”: Swamp-grass, or water-grass,
which forms broad patches and long, green
points in swamps, and is often dense enough
for water-fowl to walk on, grows to the
surface from surprising depths. I discovered
this one winter morning after shooting two
ducks on a strip which ran out for about
20 yards from the shore, and which I mis-
took for a projecting point of land. One
of the ducks was flapping towards the edge,
so I ran down and leaped out to grab it,
but shot through the green deception into
10 feet of water. The length of some of
the grass that I brought up round my neck
was a revelation. Cattle are fond of this
feed. I have seen them swimming and feed-
ing, and horses burying half their heads
to get at it when the surface had been eaten
off. The swamp is a good stand-by for. a
dairy herd when paddocks are otherwise
bare; but where there are leeches it is a
danger. I had some cows that almost lived
in a swamp, and a couple of them often had
leeches on their teats. A cow unattended
in such circumstances soon became ruined.
* * * *
“Bulantum”: Traffic in human skulls is
now forbidden in the Mandated Territory
of New Guinea and is punishable by a heavy
fine. It was not confined to natives; whites
eagerly sought skulls, particularly those from
the Sepik River, for which a pound a skull
could always be got—even within the Terri-
tory. These Sepik River skulls are excellent
samples of native art. The features of the
dead are modelled in clay, and human hair
is stuck on the scalp. Shells are inset as
eyes, and after the artistic restoration has
been baked one has a fair idea of what the
deceased looked like in life.
* * * *
“C. Coral” : Now that carpet-snake skins
are fetching big prices, the Torres Straiters
and the mainland boys are keeping their
eyes open for good specimens. Charlie
Lifu, an old hand, was lamenting his ill-
luck. “Me, I go out shooting wallaby,” he
confided to the writer; “I take my gun and
two dog. By-’n-by I see big wallaby, and
I keep quiet, ready for shoot. That wallaby
he stop, look up along tree. I slew my
eye and I see big carpet-snake ; he got tail
; fast round tree, and put his body out straight
like bar. long way. That wallaby he look, he
think ‘What kind ting that?’ That carpet-
snake he make his head come out quick,
catch that wallaby long neck belong him. That
wallaby he sing out, and he kick, kick, tins
way and that way and try run round. But
that snake he turn his body round now, tie
him up all same man coiling rope along boat,
haul him come close to that (ree. All time
he make him come more small. When he
haul him close up now, he get ready tor
swill down that wallaby. He make spit, all
over him first, and leave him ; then do that
trick again and leave him ; by-’n-by swill him
down. I no wait that one, though. I take
some piece wood and kill that snake ; then I
say, ‘T’ank you for get that wallaby for me,
and I 'take him go. He proper big wallaby.
Before, I see carpet-snake eat plenty wallaby
—but I too sorry this time; Ino savee that
skin he got price, and I chuck him away;
I look round good ’nother time, though!”
* * * *
“Kayeff”: One interesting island custom
wiped out by the spread of civilisation was
the keeping of a village virgin. This used to
be a feature of villages throughout the Gilbert
group. The maiden was kept from infancy
under strict guard in a specially built hut,
the sides heavily matted to exclude all strong
sunlight. The practice had a religious sig-
nificance, and a powerful tabu was laid on
the immediate vicinity of the hut. The incar-
ceration lasted till the girl was about 17.
Long immurement without sunlight made her
skin milky white. An old-time. resident-
magistrate assured me that these girls would
easily pass for Europeans.
* * * *
“Bihai”: The Binandele people in the
north of Papua have a cult called “baigona.”
It is snake-worship, and the wriggler is safe
where it exists. The Mekeo people will not
kill a snake, because it is the medium through
which the sorcerer works, and to kill one
of his familiars might mean one’s own early
demise. In the West, however, snake is an
esteemed article of diet; I have seen a Goari-
bari native weep bitterly because his boss
refused to let him waste time in climbing a
tree after a python. On a plantation on the
Tauri River I was shown a queer sight.
The laborers, Purari Delta boys, whilst clear-
ing out the kura-kura grass from between
the cocoanut-trees, found many snakes. These
they caught alive and took to a patch of
grass near where their gear was stowed;
there they tied them by their tails to the
long grass, thus safely anchoring them until
knock-off time. When the planter stepped
into this patch of grass alive with tethered
snakes he thought the boys were trying a
novel means of getting rid of him. It was
only a method of storage, and the snakes went
to supplement the rations at the evening
meal.
* ■ * * *
“Tongio West”: In all old Vic. mining
districts there is not one deserted shaft in a
hundred that hasn’t got ferns growing out of
the old steps, the corners of shafts or
crevices left by the long-forgotten miners.
In many of these districts there are no ferns
to be found within many miles, yet the
varieties found in these are astonishing. Are
birds the carriers of the seed, or what?
“AMELIA’S FELLER.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“'E don't suit me,” the old man said; “’e
ain’t a cove, I think,
As knows enough to earn enough to make
’is food and drink.
'E ain’t got sense to judge a ’orse, ’e’ll never
earn ’is corn,
’E talks like some darned foolish pote.” He
stooped and spat in scorn.
“These writer chaps are useless coots, I
dunno why they’re born.
“Now my Amelia, ’ere’s a gal whose ekal's
hard to find,
At yardin’ up an’ milkin’ cows she leaves
the rest behind.
I seen ’er get ’er twenty done while Maud

An’ cuttin’ fern or stookin’ ’ay she’s worth

But this ’ere useless writer cove” —lie turned
and spat again.
“I’ve ’eard it said that love is blind. I
reckon that it’s mad—
It’s made my gal Amelia put that cove
before ’er dad;
Me, who ’as slaved an’ slaved an’ scratched

She wants to wed that dandy dude, the

“ ’E does ’is ’air with glycerine an scent

The cheek of this ’ere cove who wants my

SOIL RENOVATION.
“Kirk”: In my district in Tas. I have
seen most effective soil renovation carried on
over a 300-acre farm. When the present
owner took it over 30 years ago he got it
cheap, as it was considered a worn-out place,
smothered with twitch and producing very
light crops. It is now one of the best pro-
perties in the district, producing wheat,
oaten hay and fat sheep, with yields of 40
bushels of wheat to the acre—often over 50—
and from 2 to 34 tons of Algeiuan hay per
acre. He has accomplished all this by pin-
ning his faith to rape, fed off by sheep.
Ilis method is to fallow for rape in the
spring, working the ground for this crop
to a very fine tilth; sow the rape with a
dressing of 14 to 2 cwt. of artificial manure
at the end of February or in MarchI—a 1 —a suit-
able rain often occurs at this time in Tas. —
feed it off with the sheep through the winter
and spring, and then plough it up in Novem-
ber or December, for wheat the next year.
Some years lie shows a good profit on fatten-
ing the sheep, other years he may only cover
expenses. Wheat follows the rape, and then
one or two crops of Algerian hay, with the
last crop of which he sows cow-grass clover.
With the exception of a couple of paddocks
under clover, the whole of the farm is under
the plough each year, and has been con-
sistently growing excellent crops ever since
his system got into its stride.
An intelligent rotation, including rape and
clover, with, of course, the use of artificial
manures, will keep any land that will grow
them practically up to its virgin fertility.
ELECTRIC PLOUGHING.
“R.X.8.”: The report that negatively
charged ploughshares assist ploughing may
appeal to “Kai te Kuri” (B. 11/S/’27), hut
it leaves me cold.
Best results in the matter of electrical
soil treatment seem to be obtained by back-
yard farmers who always forget to mention
that constant attention, heavy manuring and
augmenting the rainfall by the use of the
garden-hose may have helped a bit. The
fact that grain crops yielded more heavily
after a season when electrical storms (which
brought heavy rain, of course) were fre-
quent led to a more elaborate method than
“Kai te Kuri’s” in America. Grain-growers
invested in small dynamos and attached them
to the engines of the tractors, and a negative
potential was thus supplied to the rollers
of the cultipackers, while a positive was
supplied to the droppers of the seed drills.
Yankee papers then reported that the yields
were doubled and trebled, but the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture assures me that they
weren’t, and that the results were quite value-
less.
CROP RECORDS.
“Woodside”: “Ikey Ironbark” asks (B.
11/8/’27) why soil of volcanic origin
capable of growing 80 bushels of maize per
acre does not seem equal to producing more
than seven tons of potatoes. Under favor-
able conditions it should be, but the well-
known “law of the minimum” may be operat-
ing. In a word, this decrees that production is
limited by the available quantity of that
element of plant growth present in smallest
degree in a soil. Granitic soils are usually
better supplied with natural potash than
are volcanic ones, though poorer in phos-
phates, and “Ikey Ironbark” must remember
that potatoes require more potash, weight
for weight of production, than most other
plants, and considerably more than maize.
Galer.y and Boussing, two French scien-
tists, analysing maize and potatoes respect-
ively, found that in the dry state maize
contains 1.66 p.c. and potatoes 3.20 p.c.
actual potash. It has been determined that
a maize crop representing four tons dry
matter per acre would remove from the soil
the equivalent of 1051 b. actual potash, but
the similar removal by a 7-ton potato crop
Would approximate 1751 b.
Such analyses furnish at best only a
very rough indication of the manurial re-
quirements of crops, but at least there
is relationship between the constitution of
plants and their appropriate fertilising. The
big crops regularly grown at Woodside
(S.A.) come from carefully-chosen seed, are
irrigated, and planted in well-worked soil.
Heavier fertilising than would be practicable
or profitable under less favorable conditions
is, however, the chief factor in the yields,
and phosphates, nitrogen bearers and potash
as muriate are all used as a matter of
ordinary routine.
SOME FENCING HINTS.
“Leo Lear”: Don’t put up round strainer-
posts. It is a waste of material; round posts
take an outsize in holes and decay faster than
split posts. Rot always starts at the centre,
which then holds moisture and rapidly decays.
Another unnecessary labor with modern
wire-strainers is the large, deeply-sunk inter-
mediate straining-post. A much lighter stick
can be used, as the pull is an equal one from
both sides.
To keep straight, never look back along
the line of posts you have already put up.
Always sight ahead along a line of pickets
straightened up with a plumbob before you
commence to sink a hole.
SUBTERRANEAN CLOVER.
“S. A. Sub.”: “Leo Lear” (B. 4/8/’27)
says subterranean clover is a ivinter fodder.
This is quite contrary to S. Australian
experience. Here it is the custom to keep
stock off the paddocks in June and July to
allow the plant to gain a little headway.
It is during August, September and October
that it makes its best effort. In addition to
the “poor gravelly banks” it grows remark-
ably well on poor sandy soils, and any
amount of it grows amongst bracken-fern.
When dried by the summer sun, it is
particularly palatable because of the tre-
mendous number of seeds produced by each
plant. Further, it has been ascertained that
ewes., grazing on dry sub. clover, produce
sufficient milk for their lambs to carry them
on until the autumnal rains bring the green
grass.
Strawberry clover is undoubtedly good, but
it is not nearly so adaptable as sub. clover.
For wet, heavy soils Strawberry every time ;
but the extent of that class of land is minute
compared with the area available and ivait-
ing for sub. clover. One man can easily
sow down 200 acres with sub. clover in one
season, whereas he would find 20 acres
quite a plot if he planted each straw clover
a yard apart.
TRAVELLING TIRED SHEEP.
“Anthony Gloster”: Whilst shifting sheep
in these dry times you can’t take your
ease in the saddle and “let the dog do
it all.” Tired, drought-weakened sheep can
keep going as long as they are on their
feet, but if they fall down they may be
unable to rise without assistance, especially
in the case of woolly ewes near lambing.
They should be handled as gently as possible.
If an animal has further weakened itself by
struggling whilst lying on its side, put it in
a sitting position with its legs comfortably
underneath it, and let it get its breath
properly before raising it. A sheep, like a
cow. rises hindquarters first. With the right
hand get a grip of the wool over the
haunches, and with the left the wool over
the shoulders. Lift the hindquarters first,
and as soon as the animal has got its foot-
hold raise the forequarters, and see that
the sheep is standing all right before you
remove the support.
A HOME-MADE STUMP-LIFTER.
“ J.G.” : To clear heavily-timbered country
a home-made stump- and tree-puller comes
in very handy. .Take a strong piece of box
sapling about nine inches in diameter and
five feet in length. About six inches from
either end cut a groove around the stick two
inches wide and half an inch or so deep. A
few inches below the groove mortise a hole
about three inches square right through the
lump of wood, and a few inches below this
mortise make a similar one. A big iron
spike is now driven in the other end of the
piece of wood. The mortised stick is stood
on end. A couple of long, strong chains are
so fixed that the lump of sapling will revolve
in loops of chain. The other ends of the
chains are firmly fixed to a strong stump or
tree. Two long levers are cut to fit in the
mortise holes; and a strong spike is driven
in near the centre of the vertical windlass.
The end of a long wire rope is looped on this
spike and the other end of the rope is taken
to the top of a stump or tree which requires
to be pullled up. Two men now put the
levers in the mortises and walk round and
round, as if working a capstan. The wire
rope winds round, and either the stump or
tree has to come out or something has to
break. If the levers are 20 or 30 feet long
two men can exercise a tremendous pull.
Generally green-box stumps and trees up to
18 inches in diameter will come out by the
roots.
The higher the rope can be fixed to the
tree that has to be pulled out the better.
Long lengths of No. 8 fencing-wire, about six
in number, twisted together, will make a
very strong rope or cable. If the anchor
stump is wisely chosen a large area of
ground can be worked over without shifting
the windlass more than a few feet. If the
ground is very hard dig a hole about two feet
deep at the base of the tree or stump on
the side to which the pulling-rope is fastened.
ARE SIIEEP GETTING LAZIER?
“N.M.L.” : Now that wool is being piled on
sheep, their constitution being impaired to a
certain extent, they have lost their ability
to wander over large areas of country. It
is a rare thing to find a mob of sheep feed-
ing more than two miles from water —in
fact, I’d go so far as to say that it is almost
impossible for them to walk that distance
and do well. How much of the pastoral
country of N.S.W. and Q. is within two
miles of water? Is there two-tliirds of it?
I doubt it.
In many cases, particularly in the artesian
area, the water is shamefully—nay, sinfully
—wasted. Here’s a glorious stream of water
let run into a creek, to meander down
that and form swamps and lagoons, choked
by bulrushes and wasting its very life in
sinful extravagance. Roughly, in an ordi-
nary creek-bed, each mile absorbs about 50
to 80 thousand gallons a day. Each and
every creek takes the maximum fall the
country allows. That, roughly, is between
six and eight feet to the mile on the average.
A bore drain decently made takes from live
to eight thousand gallons per mile per day,
perhaps less. A safe fall for a drain is
18 inches to the mile, though two feet is
better. If the natural creek falls eight feet
to the mile, and the drain has a fall of only
two feet, that means the drain rises above
the level of the creek six feet in every mile.
Six feet higher than the creek would, in the
majority of cases, be about a mile out from
it. That puts 040 acres of country a mile
nearer water, leaving the sheen that much
less distance to walk for a drink.
In the artesian area, if the bores were all
utilised to the full—or as nearly full as is
practicable—it would almost double the
carrying capacity of the country. Apart
from everything else, when stock have to
congregate on the one water the feed from
that water for a radius of a mile or more is
chopped out by churning hooves. When stock
have practically an unlimited watering front-
age there is no feed wasted other than wind-
ing pads leading in to the water. An owner
will spend £5OO on a new car; £5OO would
go a long way towards sinking a dam in a
dry corner of his paddock. He will spend
£250 on a trip to the Melbourne Cup; £250
would make miles of drains.
GROWING CLEAN WOOL.
“Trepex”: The new season’s wool-clip,
now beginning to arrive at the seaboard, is
in dry, but dusty and earthy, condition. That
is only to be expected in a dry growing
season like the sheep have had. But there
are certain worth-while precautions that may
be taken to keep wool clean. Dusty yards
and dusty gateways are the two main sources
of damage. If feasible,, sheep-yards should
be watered before the sheep are put through
them. In a fair number of places water is
available, or could have been made available
had the right spots for the yards been origin-
ally chosen. Dusty gateways are an avoid-
able trouble. There is no need to drive sheep
through them at all. If a spot is taken
some distance from any road or track where
the ground gets cut up by vehicular traffic,
and a loose panel is put in the fencing some
50 feet wide, the sheep will not have the
same dusty patch to walk over, and, having
so much more space to get through, will not
churn up the dust to so great an extent
where they do go.
DISEASING THE DINGO.
“FY7”: Recently sheepmen have sug-
gested to the Federal Government that the
Council for Scientific and Industrial Re-
search should experiment with a view to
inducing contagious disease among dingoes.
Distemper was suggested, and it was added
that steps should be taken at the same time
to secure the immunisation of domestic dogs
by inoculation. The idea seems more in-
genious than practical. As far as the im-
munisation of Towser goes, this may be
possible, for the cables have just announced
the discovery of a prophylactic serum in
England that promises to wipe out distemper.
But the infection of dingoes on the grand
scale is another matter. Contagious disease
demands crowded conditions to establish
itself seriously. Even the teeming, burrow-
dwelling rabbit has been able to resist
similar measures taken against him. The
dingo, though he may hunt in packs occasion-
ally, is essentially an individualist of the
open spaces.
POISONING FOXES.
“Nota Bene”: The best way of poisoning
foxes in my experience is to shoot a few
birds, such as butcher-birds—called the
noisy-miner of Victoria—and, while the
bodies are warm (this is essential), make
a deep cut in them with a keen knife, and
insert a small quantity of powdered strych-
nine. Then distribute in likely places on
the foxes’ runs. Do uot handle the birds,
but use a small forked stick. The method
mentioned by “Waimea” (B. 28/7/’27) is
a good one, but I have found, by results,
that the above is the better of the two.
ONIONS AND COWS.
“Jesmoud”: Onions may increase the milk
yield when fed to cows, as “Tongio West
says (B. 4/8/’27), but won’t the milk and
cream have a strong onion flavor? A few
years ago the cows got into my onion patch
and it was a week before the taint left the
milk. Yet my onions were white Spanish,
a very mild variety. Onions, however, are
good tor dry cows, and put on condition more
quickly than almost any other feed.
POISONS.
“Bad Australian”: “B arm a c” (B.
11/8/'27) seems to have had better luck
with oil of rhodium than I had when I was
dog-stiffening and pelt-hunting about 39
years ago. i tried it on dingoes, kangaroos,
wallabies, native-cats, ’possums and rabbits,
and the only varmint in the crowd that took
any interest in it was the ’possum. I tried
oil of aniseed as well, but with no better
result. Freshly-crushed caraway-seed gave
good results with black wallabies and ’pos-
sums, the big black-pointed silver-grey vari-
ety in particular; but the dingo, kangaroo
and native-cat passed it by. Among many
baits used for poisoning rabbits, 1 found
thoroughly-ripe quinces and strychnine the
most effective.
THOSE MILLIONS OF DEAD SHEEP.
“Jim Domino”: Did "0.M.” (B. 4/8/’27)
give a moment’s thought to the calamity
which would have resulted if his scheme of
“shifting the sheep to the tucker” could have
been put into operation in the present Cen-
tral Q. drought? I resided in the North for
18 months of the present ruinous period, and
saw sheep going in every direction to agist-
ment country. A few went up towards the
lerntory; some towards South Aus.; others
were sent to relief country about the coast,
while N.S.W. absorbed thousands. Although
the stock seemed fairly well distributed a
number of owners were caught at their own
game, because when the grass cut out they
were trapped, and by the time they suc-
ceeded in obtaining further agistment coun-
try they found that it would have been
cheaper to have let the sheep die! Thus,
if “O.M.’s” scheme could have been adopted
on a gigantic scale, and the starving stock
rushed, say, to the coast or to N.S.W., the
relief country would have petered out with
greater rapidity, resulting in an unprece-
dented congestion of starvers on eaten-out
land. Travelling southwards in search of
further relief, the sheep would leave death
and devastation behind beyond even the de-
scriptive powers of “C.J.H’s” dramatic pen.
In a measure this has recently been proved,
for N.S.W. is greatly overstocked and squat-
ters with more than enough sheep on their
hands are feeling the pinch of the extended
dry spell. Had a few million sheep been
dumped in from Queensland the result would
be appalling.
While I cannot agree with “O.J.H’s.” fod-
der-growing plan in the main, I know that
there are millions of acres of natural grasses
in Central Q. which could be availed of in
good seasons. These grasses (Mitchell is
one of them) could be stacked (and thou-
sands of tons of it) and held over for many
years if necessary and be still good when
required in a dry spell. I do not venture
to suggest for a moment that such a heart-
breaking period as the present C.Q. drought
could be successfully fought by natural fod-
der, but I know several stock-owners who
would have been highly elated had they had
a few thousand tons of hay on their runs to
tide them over a stoppage in concentrated
food supplies, or the intervening miles
between paddocks and railway yards, or the
spells between the few scattered rainfalls
which some were fortunate to get.
No! Sufficient fodder cannot be grown in
every sheep district, but where it may and
can be grown, stock-owners should grow it.
And when droughts arrive, that sheep coun-
try which will not grow or even permit the
sowing of crops (such as pine scrub and
hilly country) should have first preference in
regard to shipping stock away to agistment
country.
GROWING TIMBER.
“W.M.F.”: “Larrapinta” (B. 7/7/’27)
tells something of the joys of tree-planting.
I am at the same game. Fourteen years
ago I bought 32 acres of land in the Gosford
district (N.S.W.). The timber-getters had
had the run of it for donkey’s years and con-
sidered it to be cut out. Nevertheless I
sold enough timber off it to pay the purchase
price of the block and then cut enough for
all necessary improvements, including a top-
rail fence on three sides of the property.
Then I ringbarked all the useless old black-
butts, ironbarks, turpentines and mahoganies.
Now there is a splendid growth of saplings
of all these varieties. In addition, I am
now growing there some hundreds of speci-
mens of other sorts, such as red cedars,

Queensland beans, maples, cypress-pines,
hoop-pines, silky-oak, pinus isignis, pinus
pinaster, etc. Most of these are doing so
well that the timber promises ultimately to
yield a better financial return than the
orchard, which was naturally given the best
ground.
“Larrapinta” says that one has to wait
for results in timber-growing. Quite true.
But the time of waiting is not nearly as
long as is generally believed. A timber
concern in which I am interested has proved
this. Spotted-gum, ironbark, mahogany and
blackbutt, cut for pit-props and properly cop-
piced, have shown a measured growth of
more than 12 feet in 12 . months for the
suckers, which are up to six in number on
a stump. In six or eight years each of those
suckers should yield three or four pit-props.
If not utilised'for that purpose, in 14 or
16 years most of them will be ready for
use as telegraph- or electric-light-poles. Fail-
ing that, they will, in from 20 to 25 years,
be sent along to the sawmill. The same con-
cern has proved that pinus isignis is capable
of yielding £l6OO per acre on the ground
inside 30 years. Growing timber is a much
better investment than most things, and for
the individual who takes it up on a handy
area, a great deal of pleasure precedes the
gathering of the dividends.
The only thing that has yet really dis-
appointed us is the Californian _ redwood,
which requires a colder climate and, it is said,
a certain minimum of fogs every season. That
is not to say that all other kinds of com-
mercial and ornamental timbers do well acre,
for there are many yet untried, some of wmcii
will be given a chance. Meanwhile we find
a great interest in comparing the growth
of the introduced timbers with that of the
natives to the soil and the sometimes sur-
prising effects of environment. It can be
laid down definitely that our own timbers
are as ready to respond to proper attention,
and as well worth it, as any of the imported
ones, the results obtained to date being
thoroughly satisfactory. The aim of the
writer is to make his 32 acres not only
a profit-yielding patch but also a bird
sanctuary and a show forest. At present
it promises well for all three, and is. affording
a great deal of pleasure to those interested
in its progress. Timber-growing in Aus-
tralia deserves, and will repay, much more
attention than is being given to it.
DRAWBACKS OFDROUGHT FEEDING.
“GG6”: One aspect of drought feeding
(B. 11/8/’27) seems to have been overlooked.
It is that sheep, once accustomed to being
fed, will cease to forage for themselves, and
unless feeding can be continued till natural
fodder arrives with the rains, will die help-
lessly, even with rough feed available if they
choose to go after it.
This habit is especially encouraged by the
common practice of feeding sheep into con-
dition enough to go through shearing and then
leaving them to their own resources with the
idea that, the wool being off, they will find
feed for themselves. In too many cases they
absolutely refuse to do so, and many an
owner who has spent all his resources in
carrying his flock over shearing has had to
see his sheep vanish like his bank balance,
because they have ceased to forage.
THE DISAPPEARING MANDARIN.
“X.5.A.”: The mandarin is fast disap-
pearing from commercial orchards. Citrus
growers are concentrating on the navel and
Valencia, to the practical exclusion of all
others. All the common types, such as
Silettas, Joppas and the Parramatta, are los-
ing in popularity as paying propositions. The
mandarin was until fairly recently the most
extensively-planted of citrus fruits m N.S.YV .
coastal areas, and received its first serious
set-back when brown spot devastated the
Gosford district. Despite experiments last-
ing over several years, the Agricultural
Department has failed to discover anything
approaching a remedy, with the result that
even supposedly immune localities have been
ravaged. Therefore trees have either been
rooted out or re-budded. The only large dis-
trict holding out is the Hawkesbury, but
even there growers are not disposed to risk
further plantings.
Mandarin-trees will not stand up against
severe frosts, such as have been experienced
this winter, and the fruit very quickly drops
if bitten. At least 100,000 bushels have thus
been lost this year. Apart from the fore-
going, however, is the extra work involved
in picking and packing, which is seldom
covered by better prices.
SWEET-POTATO RECORDS.
“Mullarula”: What is the record weight
for a sweet-potato? Some years ago Paul
Ison, one of the first settlers in the Northern
portion of the Pilliga Scrub (N.S.W.), grew
a monster weighing 191 b. in what seemed to
be almost pure sand on the bank of Yarrie
Lake. This was locally believed to be a
record, but a month later George . Smith
produced one on his. farm on the fringe of
the scrub which weighed 34|lb. A lot of
people round that district grew sweet-pota-
toes for a year or two, but none are grown
now. There was not a big enough market.
ARTIFICIAL MATING OF QUEEN
BEES.
“H.C.” : A considerable advance has been
made in practical bee-keeping through the
researches of an American scientist, Dr. Lloyd
R. Watson. Progress in improving the race of
bees has been hampered all through by the
difficulty of controlling the mating. The breed-
ing queen could be selected, but she mated
high up in the air on her virgin flight, and
chance appeared to be the main factor as to
the characteristics of the drone who became
her mate. Mating in large tents was essayed,
but proved impracticable. Dr. Watson, fol-
lowing the methods of artificial insemination
already used occasionally in the case of
animals, has already met with a 50 per cent,
success. The operation is a most delicate
one, including the removal of the sperm from
the bulb or seminal pouch of a drone with a
tiny glass syringe and injecting it under a
microscope into the organs of a queen bee.
bound down with silken threads. Since a
queen may lay 5000 eggs in a day, and
any of those eggs in the hands of a pro-
fessional queen-breeder may be used to pro-
duce a queen, it is obvious that much trouble
and expense can be faced if the result
improves the breed.
MORE ABOUT CAPONISING.
“Mrs. Lance Rawson”: The time is ripe
for the capon-farm. It only requires some
poultrv-breeder to make a start, learn the
operation and set about the breeding of suit-
able birds. For years now Sydney has had
an extensive leisured class that demands the
best of everything, and there is no doubt that
were capons advertised they would create
their own demand.
I made my own market. I had a large
orchard and vegetable-garden and about GOO
head of poultry. I started what I called
“surprise boxes,” into which I placed three
dozen eggs and a tine fat capon, and filled up
with vegetables and fruit sufficient for a
week’s supply for a small family. The capon
was dressed ready for the oven, the eggs
were new-laid and the vegetables of the very
best. These boxes I advertised to be sent
to any railway-station for 12s. 6d. I had
the boxes fitted with hinges and locks, and
for each regular customer two were reserved.
My first order was for three “surprise
boxes,” but within a few weeks I was
sending away ten and a dozen twice a week,
and I began to realise that I had started
an industry that was getting beyond me.
Then my best men went off to the war, and
that was the end. But my failure doesn’t
prove it can’t be done. The man or woman
who contemplates selling the birds and eggs
should get lessons in dressing and trussing
from an expert.
THROWING THAT BULL.
“Paul C.”: “R.McD.,” in corroborating
“.T.McG.’s” method of throwing the bull
with the half-hitch round the animal’s
flank, prescribes two half-hitches round the
bull’s body, while in the other case there
was only one hitch. To me there is still
another hitch to be explained. In both
methods the operators must rope and pull
the bull up to a post while they are monkey-
ing with those hitches. Then they must let
him go from the post (I presume they would
still leave the head-rope on) and step nimbly
out of the road. Then we assume everything
goes on according to programme, and the
bull goes down in the middle of the yard,
how do they keep him down? Please don’t
tell me that a man “gets on his head,” as in
the case of steers, for having had experience
in keeping the head of a cow’s Jiusband down
with a pole or fence-rail across his neck
with a leverage under the bottom rail of a
stockyard, I know if I got on his head
he’d soon have me on mine.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Yufu” : The simplest way to save a cow
“gassed” by a stolen feed of young corn or
potatoes is to point her nose straight out,
wrench out her tongue and draw it back-
wards and downwards. But be careful whilst
you do it.
“F.S.H.” : To beat the San Jose scale on
plum-trees, use a mixture of four parts lime
to one of sulphur. Dissolve about 21b. of this
mixture in a kerosene tin of water and boil
for half an hour. Then spray it on the
trees, keeping it well stirred, and having it
warm if possible.
“Yufu” : For worms in horses use black
gunpowder—or the powder in gun cartridges
Avill do. Use a dose of about three cartridges,
mixing the powder in a bran mash. First
starve the beast for a day, then give him the
mash. The worms will come away in
bunches. Another good remedy is a feed
of pumpkin-seeds after a day’s starvation.
But these have to be forced down the beast’s
throat.
“F.S.H.”: Two sprayings of soapy water
with half a pint of kerosene to the bucket,
well boiled up, will clean the worst aphis-
infected trees.
“Billy Ballong”: Rams, as lamb-getters,
are of little use for a month or six weeks
after being shorn, and, because they don’t
realise this, flock masters often unjustly
blame them when the lambing is 50 p.c.
below expectation.
“Eureka”: Here is an old and very effec-
tive cure for distemper in dogs. Take the
animal to the blacksmith’s shop and dip
him in the cask of water in which hot iron,
is plunged. One immersion is generally
sufficient, but in a bad case a second dip
may be necessary. I have seen dozens of
dogs treated in this manner, and never a
failure.
“Jim Domino”: In the grass country
where fire-breaks are burnt, this igniter will
be found very serviceable. Get an ordinary
piece of lin. piping about 4ft. in length.
Stuff up one end with wood or rag: if out
in the paddocks, mud will suffice. Fill the
pipe with kerosene, and then tighten .up
some old flannel, or bag, and force it into
the other extremity. Have it so that when
pointed to the ground the kerosene will not
leak out, although the liquid should, seep
through the flannel. When a match is ap-
plied to the saturated cloth you have a
rough torch which will light several miles of
break. The user doesn’t need to bend, but
walks slowly and upright.
“Stump Jump”: Mallee farmers are
troubled each year by the drift on fallows.
To minimise this the final working before
summer should be left ridged by the culti-
vator ; preferably north and south. Land
left ridged will not drift as readily as land
harrowed flat. Land left to dry out after
rain will drift more readily than that which
has been worked.
“Matrix”: Some Killarney (S.Q.) farmers
are giving corn-husks a trial as fodder. These,
except for stuffing an occasional bed-tick for
Dad and Mum, have in the past gone to waste
by the hundred tons a year. A thousand
bales have been dumped by way of drought
and winter insurance for sheep, and a local
timberman is giving the stuff a trial as fodder
for his mountain bullock teams.
“Matrix”: “W.P.D.” (B. 4/8/’27) may
know something about olive-growing, but his
rainfall figures of the suggested Dalby-Roma
district are awry. Dalby’s average is not
more than 27in. —only three times in 57
years has it reached the 40in. mark men-
tioned by “W.P.D.” And Roma is worse.
In any case, annual rainfall figures tell
little, if anything. It is time the statisticians
adopted a factor or index number which
would be some guide as to whether the
moisture is evenly distributed over the 12
months or falls in a heap.

“H.A.L.”: After a furtive glance around
the street he peeped into the bar to find
it occupied only by the publican and a
painter who, with his hack towards the
entrance, was varnishing a door. Apparently
reassured, the newcomer walked to the bar,
ordered a pint, grabbed the foam-crested
mug and then saw the painter regarding
him with ah expression of incredulous hor-
ror. With a gasp of dismay the newcomer
put down the untasted pot and fled. Imme-
diately the painter’s expression changed to
one of unbounded joy. Dropping his brush
lie seized the beer-pot and emptied it in
a few swift gulps. “ ’Sorlriglit,” he ex-
plained to the astonished publican, “I know
lie won’t come back for it, because we both
belong to the same Rechabite tent!”

TO AN OLD LOVE.
I had not thought of you these many days—
My mind was busy with such trivial things.
I had forgotten how the glad bird sings
To the first love his sweet, exquisite praise.
I had not thought of you these many days.
All this rich times most prodigally i spent
In idle loitering on a hundred ways.
Rut last night, as alone and sad I went,
Surfeit with some too-usbd merriment,
I heard you weeping, and your hands were
there
Within my hands; about me fell your hair.
I do not know how many years are gone,
How many, many were those empty days,
llow many Aprils faded into Mays—
Was it an April sun so brightly shone?
I do not know how many years are gone.
And you, have you forgotten all of this?
Forgotten that green bank we lay upon?
The glad bird singing us to our first kiss,
So full his heart of that exquisite bliss,
We laughed and flushed and praised him on
his bough?
I wonder if you can remember —now?

THE IMMATURE MALE.
THE HIDDEN HORD.
“Hands up or I fire! You are in my
power, James Manton, and nothing on earth
can save you now!”
Our Hero found himself thus sudenly
Face to Face with Death. He had wanderd
down the lonily road, and hear was Jeffery
Shotgun standing in his Path, his murdrus
wepin in his hand.
Now that it was to Late, he sudenly
reeleyesed his position. A quick glance
informed him that Shotgun was not his only
enemy in that Fatal Spot. On the rite
hand, leering from behind the bushes, was
the face of the hated Maurice Murgatroyd ;
on the left he saw the Vengeance eyes, one
of which held a revolver, of Bill Bludshot.
Each of these might hate the other, but
they hatid him more.
- But he was not dismaid. Pie knew that
curadge in the face of danger was his only
hope.
“I fear you not, Jeffery Shotgun,” lie said
calmly. “Of what use is it for you to kill
me?”
Plad the murdrus enemy killed him there
and then he would undowtibly have been
dead.
“You live in the shack where the Hidden
Ilord is buried. That Hidden Hord is to
be Mine; you must die because you Know
Too Much,” Jeffery said venimiosly. You
spared my life once, James Manton. Aha!
You were a fool to do so, for now you must
pay with yore life’s Blud.”
“I sparred yore worthless life,” said Our
Hero bravely, “becos of the love I feel for
your innercent dorter.”
“She shall never be yores!” hist the mis-
creent. “Sooner wood I see her married to
Bill Bludshot, much as I hate him. You
must die.”
But as he prepared to fire, a peersing
shriek made the welkin ring. The shriek
came from Anne, the Brigand’s dorter, who
at this moment appeared in the distant.
By her side was the poor old tottering man
James Manton had reskewed from the merci-
less clutch of Maurice Murgatroyd.
Shotgun only nottised them for a moment,
then furussly he turned on our Hero.
“Prepare to die!” he hist. “I know that
Maurice Murgatroyd, the fool lawyer, thort
to outwit me, and be the first to get to the
Hidden Plord. I know that Bill Bludshot
would like to be the first to handel the
treasure. But lie will be to late, two.”
The Heartless Villan did not know that
these two were in hiding close at Hand!
“You must me!” hist the villan.
But the moment when Jeffery’s attension
had been derverted by his dorter’s scream
had enabled Our Hero to get his own
revolver ready. The too shots rang out
together as Anne screamed again. Both
were dedly shots. Wich was to die?
Shotgun’s villany was his own
undoing. The murdrus ruffin, who
always shot to kill insted of like a
sportsman, had blunted the noses of
his bullets. The two shots, ackerately
aimed by the best shots in Australia,
met half-way; and the sharp-nosed
bullet from the gun of the clean-
minded James Manton split the ruf-
finly scoundrel’s bullet as if it had
been tisher-paper. On, on! flew the
bullet; and with a peersing scream
Shotgun Bit the Dust.
Nor was this all. Almost before
Our Hero reeleyesed that he was safe
he herd a cry on each side of the road,
follered by a sickening thud. Looking
quickly, lie saw that the wicked lawyer,
Maurice Murgatroyd, and the brutal
Bill Bludshot had fallen and were enjoying
there death throws.
What had happened was this. Split
fairly in too by Our Hero’s bullet, the too
pieces of the ruffinly Shotgun’s bullet had
been turned aside, and had found there
mark in the brests of the skulking outlaws.
In this mickraculus way had a merciful
Provadence provided the death of all the
villan s.
But Our Piero had no time to consider
all this. The fair Anne was in his arms, to
his astonusment, considering her prevus
coldness.
“I was afraid before, but now I know
the Truth,” she cried.
“She was ashamed to think the rascally
Jeffery Shotgun was her father,” explained
the old man, who stood near, smiling, whilst
they Embraced. “But fear not; all is known
now. You are not James Manton, but the
heir to old Sir Thomas Rukerly, and the
Hidden Hord is yours by rite. You will
find it hidden behind a brick in the chimney.
And Anne is my long-lost dorter, stolen from

me in infancy by the treecherus Shotgun.’
“But who are you?” demanded our be-
wildered Hero.
The old man tore off his wig, and reveled
himself as a man of middel age.
“Detective-sergeant Rooke !” he announced.
Gentile reder, the rest of the story is soon
toled. For having tracked down three such
terrible criminals, Detective-Sergeant Rooke
was maid a Judge; but even as he sentences
murderers to Death he smiles softly when
he thinks of the Happy Home were play his
granchildren. Some murderers, listening to
the Dred words of Doom, have been quit
supposed to see that smile.

THE INKY WAY.
“Arev”: What is the record number of
rejections of an article finally accepted? My
most-travelled contribution received an edi-
torial frown on 11 occasions. It came up
smiling for a twelfth try and got through.
S. M. Herald, l/8/’27:—
Back to Wagga Week, October 10 to 22, 1927.
All ex-residents and intending visitors are requested
to write the secretary for dull details.
“Coot”: Melbourne’s Morning Tost has
hit on a new advertising stunt. Every
Thursday afternoon it distributes among sub-
urban housewives 150,000 free copies of a
12-page shopping edition, consisting of
advertisements only.
“P.X.”: “Hop” was always interested in
the work of the youngsters, and it may give
one young man a moment’s thrill to learn
that the veteran regarded Jack Qua.vle as
showing most promise among the humorous
draughtsmen in the infant-class of to-day.
Quayle lately got a job on the Sydney Tele-
graph.
"G.W.Y.”: S. M. Herald runs a poets'
corner on Saturdays. My eye fell the other
morning on an effusion which commenced
ecstatically “Balls of gold! Australia's
emblem.” Just when I was bracing myself
for something fresh and inspiring in the
shape of an “Ode to a Pawnshop” I found
it tailing away into an address to the wattle.
“Clerk” : Piquant newspaper headlines (B.
18/S/’27) ? On the ultra-dignified main page
of the Sydney Morning Herald there once
appeared an account of an insane baker who
had murdered his wife with a hatchet. The
Herald’s editor almost collapsed in his por-
ridge next morning at the sight of the big
capitals: “Butchery in a Bakery !” sneaked
in by some heathen sub.
“P.X.” : “Hop” was a master of the “com-
posed page”—the drawing which deals with
several subjects. He introduced it to Aus-
tralia ; previously he had done a little in that
way in America, but discovered that it would
take a lot of popularising. There are few
Australian humorists with the pencil who
haven’t tried it since he showed its possibili-
ties ; Alf Vincent, in “Hop’s” opinion, could
make the best use of his space—though, gener-
ally speaking, “Hop” was no great admirer
of Vincent’s work, which he thought lacked
originality.
“Queenslander”: In “Six Years in the
Malay Jungle,” by Carveth Wells, an
American, I came across a striking tribute
to The Bulletin. The author had reached
the River Jelei to take over from the locating
engineer there, an Australian, who, after in-
troducing himself, called in a pretty little
Malay girl, Siti (obviously his housekeeper).
and crisply remarked : “I’ve been in this
jungle 15 years and the only things that keep
me alive are Siti and the Sydney Bulletin,”
indicating a magazine with a bright pink
cover.
“Coot”: Exit from Melbourne’s Inky
Way, the Commonwealth Gazette, which
from Sept. 1 will be published at Canberra.
The first copy was issued in Sydney on
January 1, 1901, and contained the procla-
mation of the Commonwealth and the text
of its Constitution. The four following num-
bers were published with black borders in
mourning for Queen Victoria. The weekly
circulation is about 2000.
“Peter”: Somebody wrote to The Bul-
letin’s Service Department the other day
asking how one became a journalist and
whether most journalists were something else
first. A census was taken of the office forth-
with ; and 13 members of the staff were
available for analysis. Six of them set out
as youngsters to become journalists and got
jobs of one sort or another in newspaper
offices, two were barristers first, a third was
a solicitor, a fourth an actor, a fifth a tele-
graphist (cable service), a sixth an officer
in the permanent (defence) force and a
seventh an accountant. The discovery was
made, incidentally, that for the first time for
years The Bulletin hasn’t at the moment
got a parson or an ex-parson on its staff.
A census of the regular contributors might
yield quite as interesting results. Of the
same number (13) of the largest contribu-
tors last month only four are journalists,
one is a ex-R.N., two belong to the clergy,
two are doctors, and there is one each
grazier, teacher, laborer and mining-engineer.
“M.G.S.”: One of the minor misfortunes
of the Emden was being on the wrong side,
journalistically speaking, when she encoun-
tered the Sydney at Cocos Island. Thy
Englishmen and Australians on the staff of
the cable-station were in the box-seat and
most of them had cameras. So when the
new Emden reached Seychelles (the cable
neighbor to Cocos) on her way to the scene
of her predecessor’s spectacular demise, her
officers saw for the first time a fine col-
lection of photographs of the affair, includ-
ing the incidents connected with the brief
existence of the British islet as one of the
Kaiser’s colonial possessions, the looting of the
company’s stores and the hasty departure
of A"on Miigge and his men in the comman-
deered island schooner after the issue between
the Sydney and the German raider was no
longer in doubt. The finest record was made
by T. Chapman, of the cable staff, and in
one of his pictures the shells can be seen
bursting round the Emden. I wonder if
the Australian Navy Department has copies
of these—the German Admiralty asked for a
set as soon as it heard of their existence.
“Crochet” (Bond.) : Alice Grant Rosman.
the Adelaide writer of fiction who has made
a fine name for herself in London, has
resigned the lucrative position of editor of
the Grand Magazine to give her whole time
to novels and short stories.
“J.8.H.”: My earliest recollection of
“Hop” goes back beyond first memories of
The Bulletin. I was a very small boy on
a Barcoo station in the early 1880’s when
someone gave me a book of illustrated verse
entitled “Songs from St. Nicholas.” St.
Nicholas was, of course, the famous Ameri-
can magazine for children. There were draw-
ings by several artists whose work was to
become familiar in later years, but the prime
favorites were a series by an artist signing
himself “Plop,” and illustrating the adven-
tures of Three Wise Old Women and Three
Wise Old Men. The whimsicality of the work
was an abiding joy, even in the nursery. The
memory of those early “Hop” drawings and
the memory of the two trios will abide with
me until the time comes to follow the genial
laughmaker.

The Patchwork Revue at His Alajesty's,
which helped the Civil Ambulance and re-
turned soldiers, attracted audiences of ail
our nafeest people. Supper and a dance
on the stage after the show were extra at-
tractions. The Embassy Ten swung
shapely limbs beneath petalled flounces of
almond-green taffetas, silver skull-caps with
a posy of primroses saucily dangling over
<me ear topping the rig-out. The “Tell Me,
Pretty Maiden” chorus from “Florodora”
was sung by girls in early-Victorian frocks
of organdie of varied lines and crinoline
hats. Three dozen small girls, pupils of
Jennie Brenan, floated and glided in white
tulle and satin to Chopin melodies. Biddy
Tallis—her mother organised the show—
had a large green bead parrot on a red
velvet frock, and a silver hell-topper perdu d
upon a white wig. Margaret Nicholson.
Gwen and Alarie Tait, Jocelyn Purves
Smith and Phyllis Holmes Hunt also dis-
played some smart frocks, and indulged in
song and patter. Elsa Andrew appeared in
dramatic roles, and dressed the parts fetch-
ingly. Ted Thye and Sam Clapham, the
wrestlers, appeared in a new role as auc-
tioneers. AVhite fur or glimmering bridge
coats covered most of the feminine apparel
in d.c. and stalls.
Ex-students of Toorak College held a bridge
party at Alenzies’ to provide, tennis courts
in the new grounds at Frankston. Between
games beautifully-clad maidens sold flowers,
sweets and cigarettes. The organising com-
mittee included Mrs. P. O’Hara AVood, presi-
dent of the Old Girls’ Association; Airs.
W. Fanning, whose frock of reseda-green
georgette was decorated with silver lace;
Airs. E. Herring (Dr. Mary Lyle), who was
in black velvet softened with filmy lace;
and Airs. Frank Faulkner. Iris Connolly,
one of the most successful sales girls, was
a striking figure, cherry-red from corsage,
to satin slipers. Theo Gibb was swathed in
variegated pink fringe from neck to knee.
Margaret Cumming wore a glittering wrap
over dull green. Dorothy Alollison was softly
clad in amber chiffon and lace. The princi-
pals of the college. Robina Hamilton, in a
dahlia-hue'd frock, and Sister Barbara, in
black, gave the party the approval of their
presence. Among the players were Robert
Wilkins and his wife. Airs. Alec Russell,
Mrs. Bowes Kelly, Alarie de Bavay and Airs.
S. J. Staugliton.
The Junior Alusic Makers’ League’s bal
masque at Homeden, the Toorak domicile of
the Henry Rosenthal couple, was part of. tli c
drive for funds for a permanent orchestra.
The ballroom comfortably accommodated the
390 dancers. Supper was spread in the
dining-room amid Duchess of York pansies.
Airs. Rosenthal, who wore blue-and-gobi
shot lame, received some beautiful blossoms
in acknowledgment of her good nature.
Daughter Margot, a charming black-liaired
lass, wore a lengthy frock of white with
fairy silver-thread traceries; her equally
good-looking sister Elva danced also in white,
hut hers was bordered with crystal and onyx
fringe. Beryl Ainslie. president of the
league, wore a gown of liarvest-moon hue,
splashed with gold. The lion. sec. of the
league, Mrs. Alarsliall Wood, who ran a
side-line sale of flowex-s, topped a white satin
frock with a silver and pink bridge coat.
Airs. J. J. McMahon, in white, and Alina
Wisehcr, in delphinium-blue with inlets of
ecru lace, secretaried the jazz. Traders in
balloons, cigarettes and other things in-
cluded Bertha Schwartz, whose pink attire
was showered with rhinestones, Ethel See-
kamp, in a confection of silver lace and be-
gonia-pink georgette, and Mavis Carnegie.
Dr. and Mrs. Mark Gardner, Airs. A.
Richards robed in pale green with glisten-
ing adornment, Jean Hambleton, Dr. and
Airs. Teddy White and Aimee Shackell were
dancers.
The dance at Malvern Town Hall on
Friday night engineered by the younger
set was a jolly affair. Edna Tabart, in
drapery of softest pink sprinkled with
crystal; sister I’ipic. wearing floral-traced
ecru lace; Sylvia Knox-Knight, in flame
georgette and gold lace; and Nancy Allen, in
poppy-red georgette, were ringleaders. The
local branch of the Women’s Hospital Aux-
iliary. of which Airs. T. A. Tabart is presi-
dent, benefited. Alayoress Alorell was there,
robed in black georgette covered with a
brocaded gold tissue coat. Her daughter
Sheila, who was one of the workers, danced
in cloth of silver embroidered in mesh design.
Airs. Herbert Brookes, president of the
Women’s Hospital, came in silver and black
brocade. Alarie de Bavay, wearing pale blue
all asparkle, took charge nf the bridge
players, and Beryl Ainslie helped with the
hostessing, too. The Rogers-Thomsons and
Kathleen, the Percy Matthews couple, Airs.
Ben Cha-ffey, whose deft-blue frock bore
plumage of shaded tones, and the Fred Scar-
lotts were in the joyous throng.
The Chinese jazz to help the Melbourne
Hospital was an affair .at which the Orient
was' outshone in Orientalism by the Occi-
dent. Shingled Chinese flappers danced in
evening frocks that showed no trace of
exotic origin. Some of their partners donned
a native garment over dress-pants, hut an
Australian won the prize for best Oriental
rig-out. Mayor Morell took a party to
see tiie fun. Chinese Consul Quee’s wife was
in sunset-pink georgette with gold embroid-
eries. Beth Darvall floated round in a
cloud of blue powdered with crystals.
The pretty rooms of Chastletow, gay with
pink heath, fruit blossoms and anemones,
were filled with dentists’ wives and daugh-
ters from all over Australasia the other
afternoon —part of the Dental Conference
social festivities. There was tea and music
by Uni. Con. students. The hostess was
Airs. AA r . J. Tuckfield, whose burgundy-hued
gown had panels of parchment hue, and
she was aided by Mrs. Arthur Prytz in black
and white and Mrs. George Findlay, who
wore bois-de-rose georgette with millinery of
paler hue.
The Dental Congress ladies dined with
the entertainment committee at No. 9 on
Thursday night. About 150 of the shingled
sex chattered over tables gay with Iceland
poppies and daffodils. Airs. \Y. J. Tuck-
fieiu, in a gown of vernal green, spoke wel-
coming words, which were echoed by Airs.
James Lewis and Airs. Arthur Prytz, both
in black. Among visitors who said thanks
were Airs. \V. 11. Parker (Q.), whose iris-
toned covering was cheered with a trail of
silver beads; Aliss Praed (N.N.W.), in
tourmaline-pink chenille-embossed georgette;
Airs. C. O. Tebbutt (W.A.), in a fringed
gown of black; Mrs. Taylor (ALL.). attired
in blends of mauve, and Mrs. T. F. C.
Alattingley (Tas.). Airs. J. Alenzies, of
Bananaland, looked attractive in plum-col-
ored velvet, and Mrs. Gershon Bennett
sported silver and ruby sequins on a black
frock.
A hop at St. Ivilda Town Hall on Friday
night rounded off the entertainment of the
dental delegates. Dr. W. J. Tuckfield and
liis wife, she in biscuit-colored georgette and
lace, did the honors, the lady receiving a
posy from the hospitality committee as a
tribute to her supervision of the social pro-
gramme of the week.

b o u r n e of
Edward P.,
when she was
c o inmissioned
to design pro-
grammes and
menus for
some of tiie
swankiest
functions. E.
AVindsor liked
one that depicted Australian birds so much
that he autographed a copy for the artist.
The most popular win at the Oakland
Hunt Club’s races at Moonee Valley was
that of Claude etrice, son of the chairman
of the V.A.T.C. 'He rode a fine race. His
wife, whose natural kasha suit was allied to
a deep pink felt hat, looked veiw proud of
her husband’s achievement. Followers of
the hounds rolled up in full strength, and a
dull day brought out many fur coats and
tweed tailored suits. Mrs. E. T. Embling
and her daughter, Mrs. Fred Grimwade.
Mrs. Cudmore, Mrs. W. E. Bates (a study
in black and white), Mrs. Charles Moore in
a suite of frisca cloth of wine tones, Mrs.
Albert Weigall, Betty Bales. Violet Farmer
and Joan Newbigin were glimpsed on the
course.
Frances Alda got a cordial welcome from
old admirers and made hundreds of new
ones when she sang at the Auditorium on
Saturday night. She has personality. Her
black gown, partly obscured by a huge black
feather fan, was short in front and swooped
to a long train that blazed with diamente
from corsage to below the waist-line. Stole
ends glistening with crystal and emerald
dangled from the square neck almost to the
ground. Ropes of pearls round her neck
and a twinkling bandeau round her fair
locks added the finishing touches to a strik-
ing outfit. Cartloads of daffodils, wattle
and violets were handed over the footlights,
and there was, of course, a gilded laurel-
wreath inscribed “Alda.” All Melbourne’s
musical world was there.
This is Stanley Parker, the artist who did
the colored illustrations for Madame Adda’s
hook of verse, “The Garden of Love,”
now in the
print e r ‘s
han d s. O n
leaving Mel-
bourne Gram-
mar School,
where he won
the prize for
drawing in
three succes-
sive years, lie
become a stu-
dent at the
National Gal-
lery under Bill
Me I n n e s,
much to the
disappointment
of his dad,
who wanted
his offspring
to follow in
the parental
footsteps and
become a wool-
buyer. The clever young Australian —lie's
only IS -has already to his credit a con-
siderable output of decorative work, and
the poets and poetesses find him a kindred
soul. Stephanie Deste, of the Rose Marie
co., is another of the muse-ridden folk who
have asked him to illustrate a collection of
poems. Lafayette made the picture.
“Madame Pompadour,” presented to a
crowded house at Ilis Majesty's on Saturday
night, introduced Melbourne to Beppie *io
Vries, who wore the brocades of the King’s
favorite becomingly. Her first entrance was
in raiment of softest green with a skirt dado
of pink roses, and the dinkiest of green
hats perched upon red hair. But she looked
well even when wrapped in a soldier’s blue
cloak. Vera Spaull, one of the native-born,
held her own for vivacity and good looks in
an all-blue turnout and some less grand
attire. The usual first-nighters thronged
d.c. and reserved stalls, and the Tallis lady,
some Taits, and a party with Mrs. Charles
Wenman had the boxes. The H. H. Smith
couple, Mrs. A. V. Kewney in sparkling
black, Dr. and Mrs. Lionel Hood, Admiral
Napier and his wife, Commendatore and
Donna Grossardi, the Percy Blackbourn
couple and Mrs. Plunkett were glimpsed.
Travellers by road to Geelong in future
years will pass through a continuous avenue
of trees. The planting of the first five miles
of hardy evergreens was celebrated on Friday
afternoon, when the State Governor and
Lady Somers, Premier Hogan and his wife
and the Mayoral Morells took spade in hand
and put the finishing touches to the job.
After that many willing hands ran the after-
noon’s planting tally up to 300. A guard
of honor, a band and tea were features of
a pleasant outing.
Jean Stuart Taylor shook off a bad attack
of ’flu only just in time to keep an appoint-
ment at St. John’s, Camberwell, with Dr.
George 11. Gutheridge, of Yarraville. She
twinkled brightly in silver lame and a foam
of Honiton lace, over which fell a cascade of
embroidered tulle forming the train. A
precious veil of hand-made Belgian lace was
confined by a jewelled head-dress of pearls
and brilliants and sprays of orange-blossom.
The three ’maids, Aileen Proctor, Dolly
Grover and Gladys . Edwards, wore petal
frocks of pink taffetas and pink tulle hats.
Mrs. Charles Taylor received at No. 9 after
the wedding.
Aiay and—well, September were linked
when Jean, daughter of the late Dr. A. C.
Yelland and of Mrs. Yelland of Elwood, said
her vows to F. G. Cerexhe, an overseas
visitor who has interests in oil. The bride,
who is just stepping out of her teens, was
clouded in white chiffon scattered with dew-
drops, in a frame of tulle and Limerick lace.
Her two ’maids were in almond-green tulle,
with sparkling hair adornment. The after-
feasting was at Chastletow.
Margaret Helen, daughter of Lt.-Col. and
Mrs. Campbell, of Malvern, was arrayed in
gold-embroidered cream satin, rose point and
Limerick lace when she wed Eric L. James,
son of the J. K. James couple of East
Kew. Two small nieces of the bride, Joan
and Helen Connell, in frilled frocks of blue
and pink, attended. The Windsor saw sub-
sequent rejoicings.
Vernon Wilson, who twinkled merrily for
a few years in the Firm’s first row of
dancers, attended Scots’ Kirk one afternoon
last week and received a plain gold ring
from Jack Wrigglesworth. Her gown of
ivory chiffon velvet shot with silver was
held with a pearl girdle, and a trail of
orange-bloiss,orns climbed down the skirt-
length under a floating mist of tulle. Her
Titian locks were bound with a circlet of
blossom. Freda Hepburn was attendant,
in pervenche-blue georgette and a tulle ban-
deau. Masses of pink blossom decorated
the board spread at Oockerton’s cafe. The
bride being a Sydney girl, a number of
relatives and friends came over the border.
The McMicking clan, of Toorak—they
used to live on the broad acres of Manus
in N.S.W. —are rejoicing over the engage-
ment of the late Germaine McMicking's
eldest girl, Maillard Germaine, to lan 11.
Tuckett, son of the late Reginald Tucketl,
of Toorak.
Rawdon Cbomley, who has been having a
holiday in London, has chosen a Victorian
girl to share bis l’atagbnian exile. She is
Kathleen, only daughter of the late E. (i.
Herring of Tiverton. The engagement was
announced on the eve of his departure for
South America.
The second member of our Naval Board,
Captain J. B. Stevenson, is bringing over a
wife and family. He was Australia’s naval
representative in London for some time.
Captain Harry Feakes has taken the London
job.
Maud Moleswortli is off to the South Sea
Islands to bathe in sunshine as a cure for
ills that developed during winter. As a
companion she has borrowed Mrs. Norman
Bayles’s daughter, Ajliffe Neil. They in
tend giving our climate a good chance
to warm up, returning just in time for the
Cup.
The Valentines, who went to London to
cast an eye on their daughter, Mrs. l’res-
cott, have concluded a very happy visit, and
intend to saunter through Italy on their way
home.
Mrs. de Vere Allan, who is staying with
her mother, is getting ready to return to
Kenya—her husband has preceded her.
Lynne Teure will be her companion and
guest at the East African homestead, and
after sampling life on the Equator will go
to England. George Dickson is hurrying
back to see bis daughter before she leaves.
Acting Agent-General Wright had the un-
pleasant. task during the week of breaking
the news to Dr. S. S. Cameron, Director of
Agriculture, and Mrs. Cameron, who are
visiting London, that their elder son, Milne,
bad died at Alexandra Hospital in this State.
The doctor went to England as a repre-
sentative of the Commonwealth to attend
the conference on scientific and industrial
research.
Margot Goyder and Neville Joske, who
collaborate under the pen-name of Margot
Neville, are rejoicing. Their book, “Safety
First,” which lias already bad a flutter on
the fliekery screen, is to be dramatised. Miles
Malleson worked out the stage arrangement,
which bears the title of “Love at Second
Sight.” Early next month London will see
the comedy, with Dennis Eadie and Phyllis
Titmuss in the leading roles.
Returned soldiers lost a good friend last
week with the sudden passing of the wife of
John Mills of Powerscourt, Maffra. Her
interest in the men who fought the Big
Scrap began when the first tents were
pitched at Broadmeadows, and she did her
best to make camp life, and especially camp
fare, bigger, brighter and better. Later her
parcels of comforts followed the boys to the
trenches and hospitals, and to prisoners of
war in Germany. When the war was over
she took some of the military hospitals under
her wing. An 0.8. E., conferred quite re-
cently, was reckoned to be about the best-
earned one in this State.
South Yarra tennis club members indulged
in jazz on Saturday evening, when many
giants of the courts put in an appearance.
Esna Boyd, in a forget-me-not-blue frock
topped by a shimmering bridge coat, the
Lindley Bakers, the Ivan Guttmans. she
in a jade-green glistening robe, Marie de
Bavay and Francie Kelly were dancers.
“A.G.M.’s” note from London: —
Lady Stradbroke’s dance on the first Monday in
July served the dual purpose of a fete for the Ladies
Charlotte and Helena Rous and a welcome home to
the eldest son, Lord Dunwich, who had thoroughly
enjoyed the Renown tour with the Yorks. The
gardens at Ilenham Hall, which are among the most
beautiful in Suffolk, were laid under lavish levy for
the roses and delphiniums which made the new
Stradbroke home in Belgrave-square look very lovely.
The ball was one of the best of a very brilliant season,
and among the well-known hostesses who gave dinner
parties for it were the Duchess of Montrose,
Katherine Duchess of Westminster, Lady Jellicoe,
Lady Kathleen Villiers, Lady Alexandra Villiers and
Lady Boyne.
Carmen Pascova, the handsome daughter of the
Pinschofs of Melbourne, gave a recital at the Wig-
more Hall on July 12 and revealed herself as a
highly intellectual singer, very finished and with an
understanding of the various schools. The pro-
gramme consisted almost entirely of German leider
ranging from Schubert and Brahms to Strauss, but
she was also very successful in a French group.
Madame Pascova has great ease of manner, grace of
bearing and a flair for wearing fine clothes, all
very helpful assets. Her pronunciation of English,
French and German is admirable. If England were
booming in music this young Australian is one
whose services would be rushed for exclusive recep-
tions and high-class concerts.

IRISHMEN the world over have woven a halo of romance
around Dublin. Poets have delighted to sing of the queen
city of the Emerald Isle —and the mere mention of “dear
ould Dublin” is sufficient to bring, a light to the eye and a
panegyric to the tongue of every son of old Ireland.
The faith of the son of Erin in the excellence of everything
which is of Dublin origin is further enhanced by the con-
sistent superiority of a famous Dub-
lin product-John Jameson Whiskey.
For at the Bow Street Distillery,
Dublin, “J.J.” Whiskey has been
distilled since 1780, and the same
distinctive qualities which brought
it into immediate popularity account
for its continued preference by
sound judges of whiskey after a
lapse of nearly 150 years.

STOCKINGS
The gold pillars and dark panelling of
the Ambassadors were a proper setting for a
ball of Lorenzo the Magnificent. To it the
courtly Medici summoned through his heralds
(very brave in the Medici livery, the six
balls on their tunics seeming a direct guide
to the Land of Promissory Notes) the great
of five centuries in Art and Letters. Dr.
Baccarini, president of the Dante Alighieri
Society, was the Medici to the life as he
stood in the ballroom receiving liis guests.
They came in ones, in twos, in groups.
Michel Angelo, Savonarola, Orlando (Furi-
oso indeed, with his brigand beard and his
towering height), Petrarch and his circum-
spect Laura, Ariosto and that scheming Mr.
Machiavelli, with whom the associate of
angels and madonnas, Botticelli, strangely
enough consorted. There was a Boccaccio
set washed clean of all naughtiness. There
were Tasso, Goldoni, Alfieri and Manzone
sets : and when they were assembled the ball-
room presented a scene glittering with color
and romance, and thrilling with novelty.
Last of all, making the grand entry, came
Dante and Beatrice —Dante in red robes that
might have been incarnadined by the life-
blood of thousands of crimson roses; Bea-
trice, remote, shy, virginal in the sweeping
softness of white satin, her hair bound with
pearls, and carrying tall white lilies on her
arm. No wonder the crowded room drew a
breath and then burst into applause! The
pair were Beryl Lynox and Captain Vez-
zoli. Others notable were Mrs. Ferrari Pass-
more as the Countess of Albany, pretty
Kathleen Pye as Filiberta, and Elvira
McManamey as one of the ladies who sat
telling amusing stories while their city was
under the flail of a devastating scourge. The
Mayoral Mostyns and the Consul for Italy
showed their sympathy with the aims of
the Italian Literary Society by their pre-
sence.
The British Music Society’s party last
\veek had the Royal Art Show for its set-
ting ; and the pictures by Australian painters
were a fitting accompaniment to the all-
Australian bill of musical fare. Alfred Hill’s
string quartet led off; Frank Hutchens and
Rex de Cairos-Rego had joined forces in a
’sonata which was interpreted by Ruby Rich
and Bryce Carter; Roy Agnew, Arthur Ben-
jamin and Freda Franks were other com-
posers who added works of note to the pro-
gramme—Freda’s “Cradle Song” was
acclaimed so warmly that she thinks of
publishing it. Lady de Chair, who is the
society’s patron, wore one of her best
dresses and her second-best wrap for the
occasion, the frock a glittersome gold and
Oriental larmi, and the cloak a handsome
black-and-gold structure, with which the fin-
ishing dash of ermine and diamonds went
harmoniously. With her came the wife of
Flying-Chief Fellowes. Others who lis-
tened and applauded were the Cyril Monks,
Mrs. Allard, Gladys Teece, the Laidley
Evanses, flautist Arlom and rows and rows
of the muscial elect —not forgetting Ger-
trude Barton, who for love does the work
of half a dozen secretaries in the interests
of home-grown music.
Old salts and young salts who go down
to the sea in skiffs went down to the Ambas-
sadors in pumps the other night to have a
fling in the interests of the inter-State
King’s Cup: to this channel the flow of door
money at the N.S.W. Rowing Association’s
annual dance will be diverted. The entrance
to the palm court was brave with the
blue and white pennants that told of vic-
tories won, and inscribed oars sang the same
saga for those who cared to read. . Q. L.
Deloitte, the veteran president of the asso-
ciation, handed with the air of a Raleigh
a posy of violets to the palely gold-wrapped
Mayoress Mostyn, who, with her civic lord
and Town Clerk Layton, was the guest of
honor. laterally hundreds took the floor,
and the committee that smiled oyer the
results was mixed as Noah’s house-boat
party. One host and hostess, the Tancreds,
alone entertained 100 guests.
Drummoyne treats empire-building in an
earnest fashion. It boasts the State's oldest
branch of the Navy League’s Sea Cadets,
and who knows that the Nelson of the
future won't be a product of Drummoyne?
Something such, at any rate, is the ambi-
tion of the river suburb: and for funds to
equip a local depot for training the young-
sea-dogs a dance was 1 lunched by the
Mayoress at the Cairo, the de luxe ballroom
of the village. The State Exes, motored
to the frivol, and the youngest cadet, Arthur
Soady, had the job of offering Lady de Chair
a golden posy to hold against the blue and
silver of her frocking. Mayoress Mrs. J.
Nield wasn’t forgotten either in the giving
out.of. floral favors: a fragrant fan of pink
stock was thrown into relief by her black-
lace raiment. Tom Henley’s lady, one of the
night’s vice-presidents, had wall-flowers and
poppies thrust upon her; and such old
friends of the movement as Kelso King, A.
Milson and C. M. C. Shannon were among
the group that helped the vice-regals to
feel at home. Mrs. A. Walker and Mrs.
Milton Ilall were the energetic secretaries.
The Cronulla surfers decline to be down-
hearted in spite of the fervor of local aider-
men for their moral good. “Though shorts
be long and kirns yet longer, we’ll be all
smiles to-night,” they seemed to chant at the
Ambassadors. The gambol was the yearly
function now celebrating its second birth-
day, and palm court and ballroom were tied
up in gold and blue for the occasion. The
club pennant—a reel rampant its device —
triumphed overhead, and daffodils and surf-
dolls bloomed.on every table. One lucky
housekeeper took home a swag for the Sun-
day dinner—a turkey, a mountain of saus-
ages and the crop of a kitchen-garden
waited in the ballroom to be claimed by the
holder of the ticket with the winning num-
ber. Nearly 700 danced the perfect night
away that the club might get a new surf-
shed and -boat; and those mainly respon-
sible were president M. J. Farrell, treas-
urers Miss Smith and ,T. English and sec-
retaries Miss English and A. J. Gliddon.
The little stage in St. James’s Hall was
turned into a French interior of the 1840’s
on Friday night when members of the
Alliance Frangaise went merrily through
Labiche’s comedy “Les Petits Oiseaux.”
The young men, in their tailed- and double-
breasted coats frothing over in white ruffles,
were cavaliers of charm; and the girls, in
spreading flowered muslins, were a delight
to the eye. Strangely enough the old-fash-
ioned dress and the small stage gave the
wearers an added height, so that the actors
and actresses looked of beanstalk proportions.
The acting was directed by Belgian Consul
Segaert, who hid under a brick-red wig;
daughter Henriette, too, wore Titian locks
and looked like a chubby cherub under her
flat lace cap. Mrs. Jacques Playoust made
an impressive entry in a salmon-pink muslin
tight as to body and billowy as to skirt.
Over this she folded a Paisley shawl, and
finished off her costume with a real poke
bonnet and a tiny black muff. The heroine
was played by Miss Doucet, whose face
and figure were attuned to the costume
as her pretty voice was to her lines. The
comedy of the simple plot was so well pro-
duced that the audience laughed from be-
ginning to end.
The Ashby camera caught Opposition-
Leader T. R.,Bavin’s wife 1 just as she might
have been studying the habits of the baby
zebra at the Zoo before turning him into a
whimsical set
of verse for
kiddies.. Child
verse signed

popular that
the writer will

book which she'

trated for the
enjoyment of
her own and
her friends’

Mrs. Bavin’s
other great in-
terest in life is
the cause of
the Adult Deaf
and Dumb;
and she takes more than a wifely interest
in politics, too.
Dvorak’s ’cello Concerto in B minor was
heard for the first time in Sydney last week,
being givemby the Conservatorium orchestra
with Gladstone! Bell in the solo part. This
’cellist has never done better work, and in
the slow movement qehieved a tone of
remarkable beauty. The orchestra, too,
mixed fire and freedom in its performance;
and in the Schubert Symphony, a rich mine
of melody, the orchestra added a lightness
as dancing as sunshine. Holst’s St. Paul
Suite and Wagner’s Faust Overture were
the other big works of the night.
When the curtain came down on the last
act of “Ruddigore,” Strclla Wilson grace-
fully passed on the job of giving the inevit-
able speech to James Hay, who, having
played in “Ruddigore” in England, was re-
sponsible for the production. The audience
had a great round of applause for him when
he mentioned that all but three of the com-
pany that has been so remarkably successful,
and has now been touring Australasia with
Gilbert and Sullivan pieces for IS months,
are Australian born. Hay, although he lias
spent a lot of time away from Australia, is
a South Australian.
For once the ladder and the hose were in
harmony, and that was at the Firemen’s
Ball last Friday night. The glamorous lights
of the Palais at Moore Park shone softly on
hosts of gallant fire-fighters girt for battle
as they strode, brazen and helmeted and
booted thigh-liigli, behind his Ex. and daugh-
ter Elaine. The ball had been christened
the Golden Helmet, and it was a grand jubi-
lation over this year’s effort on behalf of the
Sydney hospitals. The just-concluded art
union brought in £49,000, find with the
shekels from minor entertainments and the
Plospital Queen Competition and the Gov-
ernment subsidy the splendid total of
£153,000 will b e handed over. Mrs. J. A.
Roles, the Queen, held court during the even-

£12,496, of which Tattersall’s Club sub-

in ivory georgettes, worn with crystal and
orchids; and Mrs. Jackson, who presented
Spring masquerading as a bunch of debs, to
Sir Dudley, was impressive in black and
silver. Elaine looked cool and detached in
daffodil-like green and gold.

Agnes Murphy’s note from London:—
Now that the opera season at Covent Garden is
over and promises of another debit balance make it
doubtful if there will ever be another, all sorts of
wild statements are being made as to the fees paid
to operatic stars during the past 40 years. Most of
thesq fees are mythical. A full house at Covent
Garden when Melba and Caruso sang together, and
at enhanced prices, meant £1250, and Melba’s fee
was £250 and that of Caruso £2OO. Because the
directors would not give the great tenor the same
fee as they paid the great soprano he left Covent
Garden for years, and he and she never sang together
again. Long afterwards he returned to Covent
Garden for a few special performances, for which he
got a special fee. For her four farewell appearances
at that historic house, Patti received 400 guineas
a night; Jean de Reszke never received a higher fee
at Covent Garden than 200 guineas, and never
asked for more. For Hammerstein’s first and second
seasons at the Manhattan, Melba received 600 guineas
a performance, the highest fee ever paid for a con-
tinuous season, though Jeritza and Galli-Curci have
lately touched the same high-water mark, with admis-
sion prices greatly increased.
Dorothy . Astra, whose Australian grit tempted her
to face London by way of a recital at the Wigmore
Hall, had the gratification of receiving several real
criticisms from the metropolitan press. Although
they did not reward her with unreserved praise
they took her so seriously as to discuss lengthily the
points which would make her a really fine singer.
The voice is of large volume and brilliant quality,
but there is a hardness of tone in the higher notes.
But where are these promising singers to get
engagements when they are equipped? The outlook
in England is very bad.
Nearly all the fashionable weddings are now tinged
with the craze for grotesque novelty, which is the
keynote of most important social affairs—dogs as
guests; arches of racquets, billiard cues, golf sticks
or any old things; trained skirts; shorts; headgear
that baffles description. For the wedding of the
American Ambassador’s daughter at St. Margaret’s,
Westminster, eight groomsmen came over from New
York, and the bridesmaids’ bouquets were so big
that it was hard to see the bearers. For this occa-
sion a reporter attached to one of the news agencies
stood at the entrance to ask the guests their names.
When the question was put to Lady Astor she put
on a very confidential look and replied: “I’m the
first wife of King Fuad.” Lady Astor reminds me
of Vida Goldstein. Small, pretty, with sparkling
eyes, a ready smile and always daintily gowned,
these two plucky fighters for woman’s cause would
make very effective stage twins, though in the
matter of eloquence the Australian could give her
American prototype many points.
For the marriage of Josephine, youngest
daughter of the S. H. Weedons, of Wagga,
Bishop Radford (Goulburn) pinned on his
apron in St. James’s. Here waited Josephine,
very charming and simple in a frock of heavy
silver lace through which shone pink-shot
silver lame. The dress made up for being
trainless by wearing a jaunty little bolero
bodice. Limerick lace on the head and
hyacinths in the hand, .and a maid (Jean .
Stinson) and a maid’s maid (Sheila Mar-
tin) in floating draperies of the new shade
known as Linden green, were other of her
accessories. Her acquisitions were a ring and
a nice young citizen of Lockhart named
Gordon Drummond. Bride’s parents did
the right thing by their guests at the Aus-
tralia, where Mrs. S. H. Weedon presided .
in black georgette frocking with oxidised
bindings.
One of the picturesque weddings of the
week was staged at St. Clement’s, in Mos-
man. The two principals hailed from the
North Shore, the bride, Betty Manton, being
one of Mosman’s fair daughters, and the
bridegroom, Douglas Charles Brockoff, com-
ing from the suburb round the corner, Neu-
tral Bay. Peach blossom decorated the
church, and palely pink was the thistledown
wedding garment, to which a Honiton-lace •
train murmured an epilogue, while a tulle
veil caught with orange-blossoms and a
streaming armlet of white and pink hya-
cinths were the sartorial Amen. Three
maids who might have been companions to
Corinna a-maying added hedgerow pinks and
greens, and rounded off the picture with
armlets of golden stock and wallflower bound
with trailing green ribands. At the Anzac .
Memorial Hall, decked out in gold and
pink, the bride’s aunt, Mrs. W. V. Manton,
wrapped in ermine and black georgettes, prc-.
sided over the congratulations.
Wedding bells are ringing Mascotte Rals-
ton, one of the best known of its show girls,
off the Australian stage ; Jack Ralston has
been called upon to act the part of heavy
father to-morrow (Friday) when he will hand
her over to Philip Harris of Tennessee, :
U.S.A. .But Mascotte has an idea of going
into the movies when she reaches America
with her husband, so Australians are likely
to see her on the screen.
Alison Smart, of Bondi, became Mrs. W. 0.
Litchfield, of Cooma, at St. James’s on
Saturday night.
Sydney lost one of its oldest and most-
active medical men when Dr. A. J. Brady
passed on last week. He was in his 78th
year, and it is over 50 years since he came;
to Sydney from Lister by way of the Dublin
College of Surgeons. At first the same brass
plate accommodated his name and that of
his uncle, Dr. Moffatt, and as far back as
1875 he was resident medical-officer at Syd-
ney Hospital. Later on he served as ear,
nose and throat specialist on the hospital’s
staff, and at the time of his death still held
high office in the Macquarie-street institution,
in which he had been interested since it was
little more than a cottage hospital. Sympathy
from all over Australia is pouring in on Mrs.
Brady, daughter Moira and son Gordon.
Mrs. Ernest Watt, another daughter, is in
England, where she has been living for the.
past two or three years.
Bulletin artist Ted Scorfield lost a great
pal last month when his father slipped
quietly out of this world, after a day
spent with two bright lads, 80-odd years-
young like himself. Captain Joseph Scor-
field was as well known as a bit of the
scenery around Tynemouth and North Shields,
where all liis days, with the exception of
those spent at sea, had been passed. His
apprenticeship was served on one of the
smartest tea clippers that ever raced from
India and China to get the market in Eng-
land. He left the bridge at 45, and from
then till liis 80tli birthday—four years ago
—was secretary of the Ocean Steamship
Insurance Company.
To show that Henry Lawson is not for-
gotten, a body of pilgrims intend to make
their way to-morrow to the little mound
at Waverley to which the poet made his
last journey five years ago.
At last Sydney is to have a social centre
where the men and women to whom Fate has
denied the gift of speech and hearing may
meet for recreation. The premises of the
Royal Society, at No. 5 Elizabeth-street,
have been bought at a cost of £31,000, and
are to be the beginnings of a club which, it
is hoped, will grow into one of the world’s
best. The Ladies’ Campaign Committee for
the Adult Deaf and Dumb Society is mainly
to be thanked for the rapid strides towards
the accomplishment of the society’s aims. A
constant stream of activities has kept the
mill wheel turning during the past 12
months. Lady de Chair is patron of the
committee, and Chief Justice Street’s lady
is president.
Polo players were deeply shocked last
week at the news that Charles Munro, a
son of G. F. Munro of Moree, had been
killed while playing at Toowoomba with
the Borderers; his pony crushed him. The
fall was witnessed by his wife and one
of his three sons.
Beryl Lynox, who as Beatrice caused a
stir at the Italian Literature Ball, has a link
with the Sydney of the past. She is a
step-granddaughter of that great philan-
thropic worker. Mrs. Bensusan, who was
one of the two founders of the still flourish-
ing Infants’ Home at Aslifield 50 years ago.

Learn
to
DRAW!
Don't
Waste
Time
Copying
Anyone can learn to draw successfully provided an
aptitude for study is shown and an earnest endeavor is
exerted to master the fundamental principles of drawing.
These principles are laid down clearly and concisely in
Mr. Harry J. Weston’s Postal Course of Drawing, and
the many successful pupils throughout Australia are proof
positive of the excellence of Mr. Weston’s methods.
The vital point about the Weston Course is that pupils
are taught to DRAW—not merely to copy—and all
work sent in by pupils is carefully corrected and criticised.
We do not issue any useless diploma. The best certifi-
cate is your first cheque from a publisher. Let us help
you earn one.
Send three stamps to cover postage, and we will forward
Mr. Weston’s interesting booklet entitled “THERE’S
MONEY IN THE PEN,” which tells all about the course
and gives examples of lessons and specimens of students'
work.

Parliament opened with a flourish of trum-
pets this week. In fine weather Sir John
Goodwin arrived amidst a glitter of uniforms
and a brave array of bright silk frocks. Lady
Goodwin wore beige wool repp with bands
of fitch, a rose-colored picture-hat and a
folded tulle scarf. Mrs. Campbell was in
mushroom crepe de Chine soutached in
brown and beige straw hat, Mayoress Jolly
in beige and terracotta, Mrs. Forgan Smith
in navy and lacquer-red, Mrs. J. W. Blair
in navy, and Mrs. J. L. Woolcock in pink.
Mrs. Edwin Lilley wore a mole coat over her
navy frock, and Mrs. T. O. Cowlishaw was
in rose silk with a wine-liued velvet coat
trimmed in fitch.
In the evening there was a welcome to
Premier McCormack at Parliament House,
the Forgan Smiths receiving. Their Exes,
were there. Lady Goodwin wore ebony chif-
fon velvet and a sapphire-blue cloak, Mrs.
Campbell was in black and gold, with a peach
velvet coat, and Mrs. Forgan Smith wore
black velvet. There was music and dinner.
Unlike Sir Matthew Nathan, our new Gov-
ernor likes races, being a horse-lover. At the
Tattersall’s Cup meeting the committee
lunched and teaed a vice-regal party. Lady
Goodwin was in black ninon with a design
in roses and a picture-liat of black. Mrs.
Campbell wore black with scarlet and silver
collar and cuffs. Mrs. Ryan was in grey
with white fox, Audrey Coldham wore peach,
Rinda Robbins navy and Wedgwood, Mrs.
Blume sand Madras silk, Olga Barnes scar-
let- and black-checked kasha.
In the evening the Goodwins went to the
tennis ball in Rowe’s cafe. Lady Goodwin’s
beige mariette was worn with an ermine
stole. Sweet-peas were the principal deco-
rations, with gold-toned lights.
A thousand bows pointed roofwards and
a thousand chins were dipped to the violin
when Luis Amadeo Pares led his army of fid-
dlers in the Exhibition concert hall. Tuition
is free, and he intends to make a permanent
orchestra from raw material, which shaped
very well after seven months’ rehearsing.
Professor Elin sang several songs in Russian,
including “The Toreador”; and Gertrude
Anderson played the “Moonlight Sonata” in
her best style.
The drought goes on, and reports of
heaps of dead new-born lambs show how
the unseasonable weather is helping to make
matters worse for the pastoralists. Letters
in the papers, too, speak of mounds of un-
buried dead koalas adding their pitiful stench
to the spring wind; and there are strikes and
rumors of strikes and rows about South
Johnstone sugar, while the merry politician
waxeth fat.
As a farewell to Mrs. T. J. Ryan, who is
going to Melbourne, Mrs. Basil Bergin and
her sisters, Ba and Monica Crowe, had a
party at Toomoo, Hamilton. Sweet-peas,
gumtips and Iceland poppies decorated, with
bowls of goldfish" on green cloth. In a gold
bonbon decked with a white velvet rose
reposed a pair of gold-brocaded moccasins
for the guest of honor.

What with school plays and college foot-
ball teams the limelight has mostly focussed
on the youngest set this week. Geelong’s
two-dozen stalwarts have been doing some
sight-seeing and amusements in the intervals
of demonstrating the form of the Victorian
public, schools’ premiers, and have been led
to cast a more or less appreciative eye over
some of our prize industries. There has
been drama at Woodlands, where they did
A. A. Milne’s “The Romantic Age,” with
Margaret Newland and Lydia Reynell as
the star performers; and at the Creveen
three short plays, with “The Slippers of Cin-
derella” heading the bill. There have been
sports at Woodlands, too, in which the
Rhodes House teams emerged triumphant,
and Lady Bridges presented the prizes. At
North Adelaide, St. Peter’s Collegiate School
for Girls held a fete to raise funds for its
new buildings on Pennington-terraee. The
buildings were opened by Lady Bridges the
same day.

gain. The picture is Rembrandt's.
From England comes news that the mar-
riage of Bruce, only son of the 11. \Y.
Andersons, to Margaret, daughter of Dam-
pier Whetham, of Upwater Lodge, Cam-
bridge, will take place early this month.
Follen Bishop’s scheme for an exhibition
here by the Roval British Colonial Society
of Artists has borne fruit, and the shotv was
opened by the Governor, who had a word of
regret that it included no work by Austra-
lian members.. The Society of Arts secre-
tary vouched for it. in the course of
speechifying, that his Ex. had visited every
one-man show held in the society's gallery
during his term of office. Sturgess, by the
way, has put up an excellent record with
his latest display. All his 40 pictures were
sold—3o of them on the opening day.
The week has given us concerts by the
Bach and Orpheus societies and the mem-
bers of the Con. staff, plus a performance
by the Con.’s still youthful op*ra class.
“Prunella” and “Hansel and Gietel” were
chosen, and showed a marked advance on
anything yet done. Phyllis and Peggy
Leitch, as Prunella and Pierrot respectively,
and Phyllis Tonkin and Harold Tideman, in
“Hansel and Gretel,” won the laurels of
the evening.
Dame Melba is at Government House, on
a farewell visit to the Bridges.
Lady Bridges and her daughter were both
at Victoria Park to see the Grand National,
her Ex. in navy blue and salbes and her off-
spring in tweeds topped by a wine-colored
felt. Mrs. Gerald Armstrong was with
them. There were fur coats in opulence and
plenty, but for smartness straight-cut cloth,
discreetly befurred at neck and knee, ran
them close. Two of the younger set in
tailored bois-de-rose, and a young matron
all slim and black, were as chic as anything
on the lawns.

The welcome given to Priminister and Mrs.
Bruce by the women’s organisations at the
Imperial was a great occasion. Mayoress
Wignall greeted the lady guest-of-honor and
gave her a bouquet of violets, and at the
table with the Bruces were John Gellibrand
and his lady, Mrs. Mary Parker, Mayor and

for years.
Since 1923 she

Tlie Motliercraft Home, New Town, cele-
brated its second birthday by a shivoo to
which everyone had to bring something
weighing one pound. Mrs. Lyons cut a big
birthday cake, and Chief Justice Nicholls’s
lady and the executive were all smiles at
learning that Parliament had increased the
child-welfare grant. His Ex. put in an
informal appearance and dandled Premier
Lyons’s little boy on his knee at tea-time.
The Choral Society's concert for the Iven-
nerley Boys’ Home had as a feature a song
the words of which were written by Mrs.
Mary Dechaineux and the music by conductor
Jackson. Alan Limb sang it with ’cello,
horn and organ accompaniment. The Town
Hall was well filled, and the O’Gradys gave
the show the light of their countenance.
Anthony Clark, son of the Richmond
medico, who made his stage debut here with
Allan Wilkie, found a part in “St. Joan"
waiting for him in the Big Smoke. Godwin,
author of “The Caravan Man,” then took a
fancy to him and engaged him to supervise
the filming of his last book in America.
Our little grey city was enlivened by many
purple patches on Violet Day, when street
stalls were gay with the royal color, and
women spent long and cold hours selling
bunches of the sweet-scented blossoms. The

got the proceeds.

This year’s fancy head-dress hop, held at
Government House ballroom, had Mrs. Fer-
guson-Stewart, of the Drake Brockman clan,
as its eliief-of-staff. Her bandeau of gold
supported peacock-feathers. Mrs. Harold
Boas wore a gorgeous head-dress of
Egyptian style, made with gold and colored
sequins and carved beads. The Children’s
Protection Society got the profits.
The Kindergarten appeal is in full swing.
Government House ballroom was a pan-
demonium on a recent afternoon when hun-
dreds of children shrieked, screamed and
whistled for hours; but their costumes were
pretty, the march was excellent, and they
enjoyed a marvellous tea. Linley Wilson,
one of the dainty daughters of former Pre-
mier Wilson, has helped the appeal with
her folk dancing. She is dainty and clever,
and the liay-waggon, country dances and
• folk songs were splendidly done. Marie
Burke, Floie Allen, R. Barrett-Lennard and
others of the Royal Opera Co. helped to
sell violets for the kiddies.
Dr. and Mrs. Tregonning started a cam-
paign to gather funds for Perth Hospital
last week. They arranged a dance in the
Claremont Hall, and it went most success-
fully.
The Y.A.L. Hall was gleaming in scarlet
and gold when General Ilobbs and his lady.
Commander and Mrs. Griffiths-Bowen and
colonels, captains and majors with their
respective partners were mobilised for the
annual hop of the 44th Battalion.
Mrs. J. N. Thomson has been doing the
official work of the Repertory Club during

ISSUE of 10,000 Cum. 10 per cent. Preference Shares of £1 each,
ranking equally for dividends with Ordinary Shares in the distri-
bution of profits over 10 per cent.
QUEENSLAND ISSUE.
Now open for subscription by the public.
Investors of Queensland are specially invited to subscribe to this issue, but it is
not confined to Queensland and is open to the general public of the Commonwealth.
Applications close on September 30, 1927, and shares will be allotted from time
to time in priority of application.
At is. on application and is. on allotment; calls not to exceed is. per share per
Nominal capital of the company is £lOO,OOO in 100,000 shares of £1 each, and on
completion of this issue of preference shares there will be 65,000 shares issued and
35,000 held in reserve. .
The company has acquired 75° acres on the Palmer River, of which 270 acres
has been systematically bored, proving a cubic-yardage of 6,146,000, valued at
£332,907. A further 150 acres has been sampled, but not yet bored, for Hydraulic
Sluicing, and is estimated to return £150,000 value of gold.
The company has purchased at the small cost of £B5OO an all-steel bucket-dredge
capable of treating 50,000 cubic yards of gravel per month. lhe pontoons and
superstructure are new, and the machinery practically so. .
Of this plant 96 tons of the dredge have been railed to .Laura, the teiminus ol
the Cooktown railway-line, the pontoons are now ready for shipment from Melbourne,
and the superstructure will be completed in September.
The present issue of shares is now being offered for the purpose of transportation
to, and erection of this valuable plant on, the company s No. 1 area at Strathleven,
which has been proved by boring to contain 3,484,000 cubic yards of gravel
exceptionally well adapted for bucket-dredging and conservatively estimated to yield
a value of not less than is. id. per cubic yard. From this area alone a profit of
from £BO,OOO to £90,000 should be obtained.
The Palmer River in its early days, with primitive working appliances, produced,
it is estimated, at least £6,000,000 worth of gold.
No attempt has before this been made to work with powerful machinery any
portion of the river.
EXTRACTS FROM REPORTS ON THE PALMER RIVER.
The general manager of the Palmer River Gold Company, N.L,., Mr. Walter
Baker, late dredgemaster of the Manuka Dredging Co., N.Z., Perseverance Dredging
Co., Vic., and Annan River Dredging Co., N.Q., reports: —■
“The work carried out during the testing has proved that portions of the Palmer
River are eminently suitable for bucket-dredging, and sufficient ground has been
proved to warrant an immediate installation of a dredge. _
“I am also particularly pleased with the prospects of the Bonanza sluicing area
(150 acres), and do not anticipate you will have any difficulty in obtaining a suitable
plant at a reasonable cost to treat this portion of your holding.”
Messrs. F. W. Payne & Son, the well-known dredging specialists, of London,
write: —
“We are much interested in your operations, and, from the results you have
obtained, there appear to be great possibilities ahead of your venture; the values
are very good indeed.”
Messrs. J. V. Mulligan and H. Harbord wrote:—“As a mining proposition, nothing
could be a safer or more certain investment.”
The late David Morgan reported:—“l have no hesitation in saying that the
Palmer River is the best thing I know of; it will prove the richest dredging-ground in
the Commonwealth.”
The Sydney Bulletin wrote on June 9, 1927: —
“Gold-dredging is something new in North Queensland, and the company
deserves success for its pluck.” v

In the early stages of “Ruddigore,” pro-
duced at Her Majesty’s in Sydney on Satur-
day, there is a perceptible thinness in tie;
vocal work, due to the male portion of the
chorus not making its appearance until the
first act has gone more than half way.
Seeing that the opera was the ninth of the
series of 14, it is curious that Gilbert and
Sullivan overlooked this palpable defect.
Gilbert exploits a rich vein in the burlesque
upon melodrama, although some of the
points, such as the threat to give the por-
traits of the Murgatroyd ancestors to the
nation, “and nobody will ever see them
again,” seemed too subtle for the audience.
Sullivan matched the dialogue and lyrics
with melodious music, reaching a particu-
larly high standard in a sestet in act one,
but his work never quite attains the buoyant-
catchiness of some of the other operas. Robin
Oakapple, who is in reality the rightful
baronet, remains the honest stage farmer,
dodging the curse of the Murgatroyds, whose
ancestors insist upon one crime a day from
the holder of the title, until his half brother,
Richard Dauntless, the rollicking stage sailor,
betrays Robin’s identity to Sir Despard
Murgatroyd in order to beat him for the "love
of Rose Maybud. Sir Despard having thank-
fully relinquished the title and its role of vil-
lainy in order to become a Quaker, Sir Robin
arouses the vengeful spirits of his ancestors
through seeking to fulfil the curse by such
preposterous crimes as forging his own will.
Finally one of them, Sir Roderic, discovers
by the usual whimsical Gilbertian reasoning
that he is not dead, and bis restoration to the
title helps to bring about the final melodious
happiness essential to all comic operas.
* * *
Strella Wilson gives a breezy characterisa-
tion and a vocal technique that made all
the music easy to the part of the village
maiden, Rose Maybud; minor singing honors
go to Bernard Manning (Sir Roderic), who
makes good use of his opportunities in
“When the Night Wind Howls” and the
duet with Mad Margaret, “There Grew a
Little Flower”- —Patti Russell handled Mar-
garet’s part excellently. John Ralston under-
goes such a change of make-up when he
turns from the role of villainy to that of
virtue that the two Sir Despards would be
hard to recognise as the one bird but for
the unmistakable identity of Ralston;
Charles Walenn makes the most of the
Robin Oakapple who is forced to become
the bad baronet; and James Hay, whose
habit of keeping his legs on the jig irri-
tates, is a breezy sailor with an over-sugared
voice. Some good work is put in by John
Byrne as Old Adam Goodheart, the typical
•faithful retainer; Winifred Williamson is
excellent as Dame Hannah ; and two leaders
of the band of professional bridesmaids who
pervade the village of Red Herring and
Ruddigore Castle in search of a job are
brightly represented by Violet Jackson and
Lilian Crisp.

In “Second-hand Brides,” produced at Syd-
ney Grand Opera House on Saturday, Betty
Dorle is so careless in her matrimonial
adventures that she finds herself, on her
arrival at her new husband’s country home
in England, with one fictitious former hus-
band and another real one, from whom she
thought she had obtained a divorce but is
not quite certain, upon her hands. The
situation is almost as awkward for the latter
gentleman, since he, too, believing the
divorce to have been a certainty, has re-
married ; and the man who bears the name
which Betty had told her latest catch was
that of her first spouse, because she be-
lieved he would be better satisfied if he
thought his predecessor was dead, finds some
embarrassment to face when he comes to life
also. The effects of the tangle, although they
involve a considerable amount of dashing
about- the stage in pyjamas and lacy dress-
ing-gowns, provide two and a half hours of
comedy much cleaner than the article which
usually comes from America—the play was
produced in England by ex-Australian Frank
Stayton—the humor being greatly helped by
a series of shocks inflicted on the Reverend
Arthur Escott, M.A. (Victor Knight), until
the timorous parson is almost dazed by the
scandal he sees around him. Nellie Bramley
presents—except perhaps for her accent —
a lively and roguish Frenchwoman who has
the excellent, taste to choose Englishmen
consistently for her husbands, real and bogus.
As the last addition to her matrimonial regis-
ter (Sir JolnnDorle, Bart.), George Hewlett
makes up as a meaty countryman ‘full of
conventional ideas, and keeps well to that
reading. John Galway has seldom found a
part to suit him as well as that of Howell
James; Mabel Gower is bright but not very
strong as Lady Audrey Irvine; and Brett
Randall gives a very good study of the
Johnniefied Reggie Irvine, Betty’s tormer ven-
ture. The other characters are adequately
played.
“Outward Bound” is due at Sydney Palace
on September If, the war film “Ypres” keep-
ing possession until the eve of that date.
In "Lady, Be Good!” some starving char-
acters continue to display a cheerfulness
which might he emulated by many people
who have no fear for the daily chop; and
no change is mentioned at the St. James
Theatre, although the circulation of a warn-
ing against the infringement of the Fullers’
performing rights in “Rio Rita” hints an
early announcement of a definite date for
its production. The male chorus in “The
Student Prince” remains as melodious as ever,
and the big Empire is being kept well filled.
Margaret Lawrence gave her industrious
understudy, Daphne Bairn—she stood by
for Lorna Helms in “Give and Take” and
stepped on as Sue Parker in “Is Zat So
amongst other things—one of her rare oppor-
tunities one day last week; and “The Road
to Rome” suffered in no way as a conse-
quence. Mystery is well established at the
Royal, where Moscovitch, Avith “The
Ringer,” is enjoying his best Sydney season
to date.
* * * *
Joseph Hislop will commence to warble
at the Sydney Town Hall on Saturday next,
with assistance from Leila Doubleday, the
violinist, and Alberto Sciarretti, who fin-
gers the ivories.
# * * *
The return of George Carney has packed
the Sydney Tivoli nightly ; and nightly George
gives thanks, with real, feeling in his voice,
for the “real Australian welcome.” Carney is
one of the vaudeville performers who shine
as stars in the memory of the constant show-
goer. After a few songs, in all of which the
good matter is brought out with infinite drol-
lery, he passes on to his character-work;
as the Last of the Cabbies he reaches his
best; but the audience could do with a lot
more than the programme gives him, liberal
as his space allowance is. Edith Clifford,
the Colored Emperors of Harmony . and the
Ghezzys keep the rest of the bill at a good
standard.
* * * *
Humor in smellful eggs is an essential of
the restaurant of vaudeville, lienee it natu-
rally figures in the establishment where
Stiffy and Mo, in “The Waiters,” serve this
week’s menu of drolleries at Fullers’ Sydney
theatre. It looks a decidedly uncomfortable
place to dine at, amid the whir’ of flying
comestibles, but the audience, not the diners,
are the people to be considered, and they are
lavish with their approval.
“THE PATH TO ROME” AT SYDNEY
CRITERION.
Hannibal (Louis Bennison) and Amytis
(Margaret Lawrence).
In accordance with the practice of the
big picture shows the departure of Will Prior,
who has conducted the Prince Edward
(Sydney) orchestra for three years, and the
arrival of his successor, Albert Cazabon, are
being made the occasion of a series of
ceremonies. You pay your money to see
“Ben Hur,” and you- get these frills thrown
in, a touch of humor being lent to the affair
by the widely advertised announcement that
the stage celebrations which provide the
actual send-off to-morrow (Friday) night
“are being kept a secret from Mr. Prior.”
“The Term of His Natural Life” is coming
to a close at the Crystal Palace at the end
of next week; “The Night of Love” is to
follow. A picturised “Camille” has arrived
at the Piccadilly; it is, as pictures go, good,
Fred Niblo’s direction showing craftsman-
ship : but the old appeal of the story of the
French lady of joy who found tragedy in
a sincere love is rather spoiled by being
dragged out to ten reels packed with giddi-
ness, breast-heaving and tears. Colleen.
Moore provides brisk comedy in “Naughty
but Nice,” which shows, at Hoyt’s Theatre,
how far a modern girl can go in skating on
thin ice without falling through ; the Lyceum,
which has the Colored Emperors of Song to
help the intervals through, has a shy at cir-
cumstantial evidence in “Held by the Law.”

Sunshine in Art: —
A year ago this Showman confessed that of all the
exhibits in a big Art Society, there was nothing he
coveted so much as a bit of sunshine by Robert
Johnson. A display of this artist’s work may now
be seen at the Grosvenor Gallery, George-street, Syd-
ney, and a refreshing show it is. There is an Aus-
“THE TIVOLI REVELS,” AT
MELBOURNE TIVOLI.
The beauteous and popular tenor Herbert
Browne. Elizabeth Morgan, leading
lady.
tralian spirit in the appreciation of sunshine, and the
painter contrives to get his views from unique
viewpoints without violating any canons of art
to secure originality. In “Porter’s. Farm, Ka'nga-
loon,” is shown the farmhouse nestled in the valley,
with the upward sweeping fields around it pictured
with glorious spaciousness; “At the Green Frog,
Church Point,” is a delightfully-worked picture of
sun and shadow, and “Morning” an invigorating
beach view. The National Art Gallery has made no
mistake in buying “The Avenue.” “Mobb’s Lane”
shows, a country roadway wandering between fields.
The red tabs are rapidly going on the canvases, and
the success they indicate is certainly deserved.
“Madame Pompadour” is an attempt by
Frederick Lonsdale, Leo Fall and others
to get back to old standards of light opera,
and it nearly succeeds in making the dis-
tance. The story, told to robust and
pleasing music, is only on nodding terms
with the real career of the lady who
built model villages out of the proceeds of
the concubine business and left her king
quite dry-eyed when she died, albeit a
trifle worried as to who would be the next to
darn his socks and see that he wore Jaegers
adjacent to his skin. As told on Satur-
day at Melbourne Majesty’s, “Pompadour”
was perhaps more remarkable for pomp than
ardor, but the appearance of the Dutch girl,
Beppie de Vries, looking like a perfect
reproduction of Boucher’s portraits, turned
the occasion into a demonstration of good-
will from one small nation to another. If
the press agents can be relied on, Beppie’s
departure for her J.C.W. engagement was
a national event, demanding bonfires, patri-
otic speeches, bloemencorsos and free Schie-
dam; for Holland, like Australia, is in
constant danger of having her frail native
dykes completely overwhelmed by the Zuyder
Zee .of foreign kultur. The lady is a whole-
some, healthy-looking rneisje, with a nervous
vivacity of manner and spontaneous humor,
plus a somewhat mercenary singing voice.
Frank Webster’s first appearance in Mel-
bourne as her lover did not call for a salute
of 10 guns; nor did Peg Desmond’s, though
the lady was an eyeful in the fashions now
only used to cover the modesty of telephones.
Some old acquaintances are more easily re-
membered. The admirable Stigant was a
supple Calicot, the poet; Leslie Holland made
good work of Maurepas, the unconventional
police commissioner, and Vera Spaull was a
clever little maid to Mme. Pomp. Peter
Gawthorne’s Louis was a heavy fellow, whose
attraction for the merry courtesan could
only be explained on a pecuniary basis.
As far as most singing of the feminine
gender is concerned, the writer is a miso-
gynist, but he enters up Frances Alda as a
notable exception. He admits the vast tech-
nique that goes to produce the warble of a
Dal Monte or a Galli Curci, but from tem-
perament or physiology or misfortune he is
unable to succumb to the spell of the noises
they let loose. The sounds Alda emits, how-
ever, strike him as pleasant in themselves
and they would be just as pleasant if they
came from a tin-whistle instead of from a
large, handsome lady (sure to be described
as “regal" by the dailies) in a dazzling
hussar’s uniform with the sleeves torn out
and jewellery that glistens like motor head-
lights in a Swanston-street traffic jam.
Alda’s attempts to be dramatic meet with
considerable success. She can sing “One
Fine Day” magnificently. One can imagine
her soprano soaring above the tempest of
a grand opera ensemble in a way Dal
Monte’s never would. On Saturday she
awakened the echoes of Melb. Auditorium in
more than a metaphorical sense, as anyone
with discursive ear could notice. But she
pleased most with the unforced and mean-
ingless loveliness of her throaty middle and
upper-middle notes when she sang in foreign
tongues—she sang in almost everything but
Esperanto about simple troubles like
insomnia (Handel) or being a shepherdess
whose sheep are her all (Philidor). If she
is deficient anywhere it is in trills, which
may be the reason why they are rare visi-
tors to her repertoire, and tonal accuracy—
there was a suggestion of flatness here and
there. But she can hold the sustaining pedal
down so long that one wonders sometimes
if it hasn’t stuck. The pale sad face of Max
Ilabinowitsh (new spelling) shone about
the Steinway. He is a fine accompanist, but
as a soloist only just adequate.
* * * * ►
The only art show in Melbourne last
week was the joint display of living statu-
ary by the Messrs. Limutkin and Santel at
Olympia. In their amiable endeavors to
strangle or deform each other these two
gentlemen sclupture the living figure into
most enchanting compositions, leaving Myron,
Praxiteles and other ancient modellers hope-
lessly outclassed. They both have magnifi-
cent bodies suggestive of an attempt of a
biologist to recreate the Cro Magnon man
out of an unusually fine heap of bones, and
the art with which Santel transforms himself
in the twinkling of an eye into a rigid, im-
placable and slowly-tightening rack, oir which
the heavier body of his opponent is scientifi-
cally stretched until the muscles crack,
while the face of their owner changes its
expression from surprise to purple annoy-
ance and finally frantic pain, is worthy
of the highest critical appreciation. The
artlovers assembled, numbering 3000, seemed
to regard the pain as most important,
though some critics doubt its genuineness,
and even assert that the gentlemen are con-
summate actors who would never be such
fools as to endanger their handsome liveli-
hood by damaging each other’s limbs.
The song-burst in aid of a permanent
orchestra predicted in last week’s Bulletin
duly occurred at Melb. Exhibition, and the
army of artists and instrumentalists pre-
viously mentioned nobly did their stuff; bin
only one wing of the appalling building with
the ferociously obnoxious lighting was filled
with listeners, and perhaps less than 400>»
shillings of the million required were added
to the fund. Walter Kirby’s free-and-easy
singing (voice-production in its shirt-sleeves)
and keyman Goll’s flowery rendering of
Tschaikowsky’s B flat minor Concerto were
the chief limbs or features of the evening,
as far as this Showman was concerned.
After that he slunk towards the door, van-
quished by the glare of the electrics —his
footfalls echoing through the empty three-
quarters of the hall like the boots of a sinful
soul approaching the Judgment seat. The
next appeal should be made in cosier sur-
roundings.

of producer and leading man. Hilda Dorring-
ton plays the aunt, with a fine sense of
dramatic emotion, and an Adelaide girl, Noel
Boyd, has made her first stage appearance
in her home town. At the Majestic there
are some humorous sketches and a musical-
comedy revue, “What’s the Odds?” The
dancing of Emmie Ensor and her Six Twink-
lcrs is commendable. At West’s Pictures,
Syd Chaplin, in “Oh, What a Nurse,” takes
the place of the lady writer on the news-
paper staff, and gives expert advice to girls
on love affairs. At the Wondergraph, “Tell It
to the Marines” features Lon Chaney as the
stern Sergeant O’Hara, and Eleanor Board-
man as a pretty little nurse. The Grand ’.s
revealing “Private Affairs,” a capital story
written round letters mislaid in a country
post office.

The chief musical event at Melbourne
I’luuditorium last week was provided by
pianist Friedman, conductor Ileinze and the
University lads and ladies in combination.
The last-named did justice to “The Magic
Flute” overture, in which Mozart’s sense of
beauty triumphs over his freemasonical en-
thusiasm ; and it did justice tempered with
mercy to Chopin’s long Concerto in E minor,
with its grand solo r6le for a pianoforte
virtuoso. Friedman got innumerable curtain-
calls for it. The second movement was as
elegant and shapely a figure as the Ileinze
people have fashioned with the limited or-
chestral means at their disposal. The
Spanish Capriccio of Rimsky-Ivorsakov was
a glad row full of Andalusian sunshine
(really the same brand as Australian) and
bull-fight and fandango and the amorous
noises with which Spanish youths are alleged
to arouse their sweethearts at break of day—
apparently they don’t jazz until the first
tram in Alfonso’s land. Tschaikowsky’s
Concerto in B Hat minor ended the enter-
tainment on a note of Slav excitement.
Friedman bombarded the orchestra with
shouts of grief, despair and rage, and that
assemblage of black-gowned damsels and
young men replied in kind. It was a stirring
evening.
* * *
This afternoon at Melbourne Athenaeum a
season of Shakspeareau matinees will begin,
with “Hamlet.” Zillah Bateman will drown
herself as Ophelia, and Peter Gawthorne,
as the Danish heir-apparent, will run amok
through a specialy organised cast of lend-
ing players.
The insipid story of the girl who rose on
her toes into the best society is still being
told to a weak musical accompaniment at
Melbourne Royal, where Thurza Rogers con-
tinues to charm large audiences by her acting
and disenchant them with her voice.
Olsen and Johnson, the American fast
entertainers, are in their second issue at
Melbourne Tivoli, and the new edition, like
the telephone directory, is seen to be much
like the last. That is to say, one chapter
follows on the last without a comma or
even a fullstop, and the only punctuation is
Herbert Browne, who crops up from- time to
time with a ghostly air and a sentimental
ballad while the comedians are preparing a
fresh outrage in the wings. “Cradle
Snatchers” is still emptying homes into the
King’s.
Lacking the jollity of the fat and flowery
Queenie, Ivaai’s Ilawaiians, again at Melb.
Athenaeum, are a somewhat mournful col-
lection of Polynesians. The melancholy mis-
sionary influence is patent even in the native
love song, and for the rest, naked limbs
emerging front silk bloomers are incongru-
ous visitors to the palm-fringed beaches of
the backcloth, though the Old-Gold face
attached may be as handsome as anything
Caucasian. Frances Luiz, an island Pav-
lova with Novikoff underpinnings, is the
dancer of the troupe; Thelma Ivaai is a sort
of tropic Melba and Edward Kinilau is a
Honolulan Kenningham, with various reserv-
ations. What the entertainment misses in
hilarity it makes up for in sentiment —the
roosterish sort that the steel wire guitar and
the ukulele were invented especially to inter-
pret.
❖ H= *
A haunted bouse, a will and a bandit with
bobbed hair are the chief furniture of an
exciting story called “Easy Pickings” being
thrown upon the screen at Melb. Hoyt’s home
from home. “So This is Paris” is the
Majestic’s feature. It isn’t Paris, though it
may be the American Babbitt’s conception of
the place, but the stain or recommendation of
having been banned from exhibition in Adel-
aide lifts it out of the ruck.
“Ilamfat”: Oliver McLennan is another
Australian to dig-in in London. The manage-
ment at Daly’s booked him for a part in
“Peggy” directly he arrived, and as the play
is popular it should prove a steady job. The
sandy-haired actor has a fair voice, and,
although he was inclined at times to be stiff
and colorless, be made a better juvenile than
many importations. Ilis last appearance in
Australia was with “Hullo, Healo !” at the
Sydney Palace; before that he was with
“No, No, Nanette.”
“Hop’s” old friends and admirers may
like to have something of his that they may
put on the wall. The Bulletin’s Service
Department has taken the matter in hand
and will, on request, forward a copy of
“The Roll Call,” “I Thought I Had a
Stamp” or “The Flowing Bowl,” beautifully
printed on art paper. No charge will be
made for the print; but 4d. in stamps is
to be sent to the Service Department. Bulle-
tin Office, Sydney, tb pay for packing and
postage, and the ordinary Service coupon
(printed inside back cover) is to accompany
the request.
Poverty
Point
Phil May by “Hup.”
“Hop" by Phil May.
[While Phil May was in Australia (1885-88), he and “Hop” made one another a
Christmas present—each did a caricature of the other in colored clay.]
“(hesar’s Ghost”: Arthur Stigant con-
templates saying a long good-bye to his Vic-
torian market garden, from which he was
lured to supply the comedy in “Hullo,
Healo!” and, later, in “Pompadour.” Sti-
gant has three plays of his own which he
wants to place. He has already been in-
vited to London by Dion Titlieradge. who is
putting on “Hullo, Healo.” Titlieradge
wrote the “book” to the music of Ken Duf-
field in that piece.
“Aimalak” : I asked the old chap liow he
liked “For the Term of His Natural Life.”
It wasn’t true to life, he said, but no doubt
blighters who didn’t know any better would
like it. I found out his reason: the ships
shown were four-masters, and he came from
the Old Dart in ’7(> in the first four-master
to visit Australia —the' Berkley Castle.
“Caul Boy”: The Firm is on a wonderful
wicket. Not content with buying the suc-
cesses of N’York and London, it lias been
keeping a keen eye on the Athenaeum in Mel-
bourne. That stylish little enterprise of the
Carrolls has a remarkable record for box-
office winners which, strangely enough, are
also plays of reasonable intelligence. One
such was “The Ghost Train” and another
is “Outward Bound.” The Carrolls can’t
follow up their fortunes elsewhere because
of lack of playhouses. So the Athenaeum
is another experimental laboratory for
J.C.W. “Outward Bound” goes on the Firm’s
circuit immediately after its present season.
“Ibsenshaw”: Good dramatist as the
author of “Mary Stuart” and “Abraham
Lincoln” is, one would hardly accuse him of
being a humorist. He has just had a new
play produced by the Birmingham Reper-
tory Society. The entire action takes place
in a country pub. All Drinkwater’s char-
acters presumably drink beer.
“Craiser”: If the American O’Neill’s
latest drama, “Strange Interlude,” sees the
Australian boards, I shall be surprised. It
has nine acts, and is longer than Psliaw's
“Back to Methuselah.” The Theatre Guild
intends to put it on next year in N’York
either in halves on successive evenings
or by starting at six and allowing audiences
an interval for dinner. That is the way
the energetic Quinlan company handled the
interminable “Ring” of Wagner in Melbourne
l-l years ago. But that was an opera. The
public seems to stand almost any amount
of opera.
“Strict Veg.”: Has Melbourne variety
in its amusements? It has, of a foreign sort.
The other night I listened to a Pole playing
German classics on an imported piano.
Then I slipped out to a dance palais, decor-
ated in the Dutch style, where a Yankee self-
advertiser in tennis clothes was oscillating
to and fro with a succession of feminine
partners, while a friend read the evening
newspaper to him. He was attempting to
break a record for continuous dancing and
had been at it for 50 hours. Then I crowded
into a hall that had been hastily requisitioned
to enable another alien, unidentified, to
squeeze, gouge and torture victory out of
an elderly Finn after the Jap fashion of
wrestling. On my way home I passed a t wo-
up school in an alley. That might have been
illegal, but at any rate it was Australian.
“Wood’s Green” (Loud.): Every two or
three months Oscar Asdic gets hold of some
play of promise, but after trial spins in the
provinces the threatened success fails to
materialise in London. His latest discovery
is a new version of “Paolo and Francesca,”
by Captain Henderson Bland, who says his
work on this subject, unlike those by
D’Annunzio and Stephen Phillips, ends on
a note of happiness and hope. Asclie will
be the brutal Giovanni, Lily Brayton the
treacherous sister Lucretia, and Gwen
Ffrangcon-Davies lias been assigned the role
of Francesca. It should suit Gwen well.
“Cruiser” : What is the secret of supreme
pianoforte technique? Looking at Fried-
man’s plump hands with their somewhat
stubby digits, I was reminded of a telegraph-
operator who in his day established an Aus-
tralian record for perfect sending at a ter-
rific speed, an achievement requiring much
the same quality of touch as piano-playing.
He had a hand like a ham. Presumably if
he had also had a soul he could have been
a Friedman, but lie hadn’t. At least, he
hadn’t one above beer.
“Julius Asclie” : When Wilfrid Woleston-
holme died of senile decay with d.t. compli-
cations at Strike-Me-Pink. the Henry Hor-
rocks Dramatic Organisation (“Established
in ’93, me boy, and still going strong”)
wired to Melbourne for a new utility.
Members of the company were shocked to
find the newcomer a mere youngster—he
could have been barely 50. At rehearsal,
however, in spite of touches of immaturity,
lie proved capable enough. So much so that
when the Leading Man and the Juvenile ad-
journed for refreshment, the former, him-
self not far into the sixties, commented:
“Much to le-r-rn yet, of course, but, the
makings of an Ac-tor, I fancy.” “Ac-tor-r?”
replied the Juvenile, bitterly, as he tremu-
lously lifted his pewter —“he an Ac-tor-r?
Why, the puppy has teeth.”
“Hamfat”: Dot Brunton made her re-
turn bow to London at the Little Theatre—
previously occupied bv the horrific “Dracula”
—with Guv Bates Post in “The Climax.”
Dot pleased the critics, but the cable says
that the play was a failure. A house grown
used to shivers may have been partly respon-
sible for that, for “The Climax'' was
deservedly popular in Sydney.
“L.H.P.”: Allan Wilkie was wide of the
marK when lie advertised The Wiuter s
Tale” as produced for the first time iu
Maoriland. The play was frequently staged
there in the ’sixties and 'seventies; the last
notable production was by Louise Pomeroy,
the American, in the latter part of 1881.
Her company included William Hoskins, Bill
Holloway and Essie Jenyns. On this tour
Louise introduced "Antony and Cleopatra'
for the first time in the Rickety Isles.
“Hamlet, Jun.": Nell Boyd, now Noel
Boyd, of the Muriel Starr co.. made her
first bow in the Adelaide Repertory Theatre's
production of “Windows.” She followed with
appearances in "Marty” and “Fanny's
First l’lay.” After a few nights in the
chorus of "Tell Me More" she was given
a part in "Six-Cylinder Love.” Judith
Anderson and Jean Robertson graduated
from the A.R.T.
“Goldilocks” : The parson who was chair-
man at the church concert was dazed with
the horror of a comic song. “The next
aitem on the programme is—ah, let me see,”
and his gaze fell on the words “Ten Minutes
Intermission.”. "The next aitem on the pro-
gramme is—yes, ton minutes for intercession
and prn.vah.”
“Spokeshave" : Add Chaliapin to the pau-
tlieon of artists who have disappointed the
politicians. Like many other creative minds
who have mistaken mob uprisings for the
birth of freedom, he was carried off his logi-
cal understandings by the Russian Revolu-
tion—so much so that the Soviet bestowed
the order of People’s Artist on him. When
he got tired of singing to unremunvrative
communist audiences and tried to get back
to England there was a loud agitation to
prevent him landing, lie has since been dis-
illusioned. and as he persists in making
money out of foreign 'bourgeoisie the Moscow
art-lovers have deprived him of his title.
When Napoleon disappointed Beethoven by
proclaiming himself emperor, old Ludwig
tore up the dedication to the “Eroica” sym-
phony, but he was careful to preserve the
work itself. He knew it was immeasurably
more important than its alleged inspire!-.
And it is safe to say that Chaliapin will go
on singing.
“Caesar's. Ghost”: Joseph Hislop is booked
for a long spell in Australasia; he is to
sing principal tenor roles with the Grand
Opera Co., which does not open until March.
Of the hist organisation, Toti dal Monte,
Lina Seavizzi. Apollo Granforte and Gae-
tano Azzolini are to return. To share the
soprano roles comes Giannina Arangi-Lom-
bardi, a comparatively young singer with a
fresh voice. As some Wagnerian operas are
to be included, there will probably be some
special engagements for those pieces. The
most interesting item, however, will be
"Turandot,” the last work of Puccini, which
was produced at Covent Garden only this
year.
“Goldilocks”: There was a row at the
country pub when the company returned after
the show. The wife of one of the mummers,
hearing that another lady was posing
as his wife, had resolved to find out the
truth and enlisted in the same cause the
suspicious husbands of two of the ladies of
the co. “Mr. Bullroarer,” said the landlord,
when the storm had subsided somewhat,
“you gave me your assurance when you
booked double rooms for your company that
all its members were married people.” The
co.’s manager rose to the occasion. “Well,
sir,” he said, with a sweeping gesture, ”is
not the—ah—pres—enee of these—er —un-
pleasant people a sufficient guar—-antee
regarding three of them?”
“Caul Boy” : If you go behind at a variety-
show you find the wings full of people lim-
bering up. Acrobats are loosening their
muscles, ballet girls are trying a preliminary
split or two, comedians are oiling up "their
grins. The popular idea about great vir-
tuosi, however, is that they are occupied
off-stage in exercising their souls. This is
how pianist Friedman spends his practice
hours. He takes the Morning Snooze ?n
his left hand and. while reading, rattles the
piano with his right. Then he takes the
Snooze in his right hand and bangs the keys
with his left. The passion, spirituality and
religious feeling mentioned by the critics can
wait for the evening performance.
“Schnorrer”: Tim richest Jewish Syna-
gogue in New York pays its cantor, Chazan
David Roitman, £6OOO p.a. to give its con-
gregation the privilege of hearing his tenor
voice in the chanting w-hich is a feature of
Jewish services. While holidaying in Eng-
land Roitman gave a service at the London
Pavilion. Directly it was announced, tickets
for the whole 2500 seats were snapped up
at prices usual only at prize-fights. It was
a five hours’ service, so those who attended
—Christians competed with Jews —got good
value. Roitman was cantor at Yilna, Petro-
grad and Odessa before the revolution drove
him out of Russia.

“Would lady pictures, Lyceum, Tuesday night,
please make appointment meet young- man, healthy,
fair looks, good constant job, owns building land,
who sat next to her third row, circle.” —Agony ad.
My heart is bubbling o’er with love
For you, dear girl, who know me not.
Some good credentials I can shove
Into three lines of verse, I wot:
My looks are fair, I’m young, in health,
A steady job yields ample wealth.
And I have bought a building lot.
You spoke no word although we sat
With elbows touching in the show
Whilst Norma Talmadge showed us that
Love is a passion that will throw
All barriers down. You did not speak
Though .we were almost cheek to cheek,
,si, unbespoke, I lot you go.
My whole heart ached for your regard.
Although I dared not be a cad
And squeeze your hand. I struggled hard
But failed to snare the optic glad ;
So unresponsive in your chair
You sat, T doubt you saw me there....
I wonder if you'll see my ad.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Many Epsom candidates were saddled up
at Roseliill on Saturday, a dozen of them in
the Dundas Handicap, seven furlongs.
Amounis and Fuji San were first and second
in this race last year, and they were first
and second in the Epsom also, being well
clear of the others in each case. But it is
improbable that history will repeat itself on
Oct. 1. Lady Constance, who won (at sixes)
on Saturday with a pound more than her
Epsom weight, Bst. 41b., doesn’t look rugged
enough for the exacting liandwick mile ; be-
sides, she was not doing as well at the fin-
ish as Quan Tart (also sixes), who went
under by half a length after the jockey had
been obliged to ease him up and pull out
twice. He had Bst. 61b., 81b. more than his
Epsom burden. Calmest (20 to 1), who
has not yet proved herself a miler, was a
fair third; Boaster (7 to 2) and Fuji San
(7 to 1) were fourth and fifth. Boaster
carried 9st. 101 b. and Fuji San lOst. 51b.;
each will have 61b. off his back at Randwick.
The race was run in lmin. 261 sec. Amounis
registered lmin. 25sec. a year ago, and came
home on the bit.
McShortodds took no liberties with Per-
suasion in the first division of the six-
furlong handicap for three- and four-year-
olds, demanding 11 to 8. The Welkin’s
beautiful daughter won, but only after a
great bit of riding on Pike’s part. Sneaking
a run on the rails at the home turn, he rode
her with hands and heels when tackled by
Greenline (5 to 1) and, getting the last
ounce out of her over the last 50 yards,
beat the three-year-old by a head. Greenline
had a bad position at the barrier and, after
making up a lot of ground, was carried out
at the home turn; had it fallen out other-
wise even Pike’s artistry would have been
unavailing. Ariedon (14 to 1) was a fair
third, and Lord Kennaquhair, a promising
sort of youngster from Newcastle, headed
the others. Although she carried 9st. 81b.,
121 b. more than her Epsom weight. Per-
suasion got over the distance in lmin. 13-}sec.
—only Isec. more than the fastest six fur-
longs ever clocked at Rosehill
The second division was a very good bet-
ting race, big money coming for Cimon (7 to
4), Blather (7 to 2), Sion (4 to 1) and Ari-
kiwai, a Maoriland gelding in F. L). Jones’s
team. Justify (25 to 1), also Maoriland-
bred but Randwick-trained, hopped out with
a good lead, Cimon and Sion being the clos-
est of her pursuers when they had settled
down. Eric Connolly’s horse was galloping
like a winner as they shot into the straight,
but his condition (or courage) gave out all
of a sudden and he drifted into third place,
the outsider defeating the fast-finishing Sion
by half a length in lmin. 14sec. Arikiwai
and Blather, both well back, were next. Jus-
tify is trained by D. Lewis for J. J. Leahy.
The stable deserved a change of luck, for in
the course of a few months it has lost
Grecian Orator and Polycletan’s half-
brother Pedestal by death.
Percival, the Perth jockey, rode Justify,
and he was also on Drawbridge, winner (at
threes) of the August Handicap. 11 furlongs,
for which there were only five starters.
Taking the stocky English horse to the front,
he made the pace too warm for Fondant (<
to 2). Tibbie (5 to 2) and the other pair—
his steed got over the 11 furlongs m 2min.
19fsec. Drawbridge has only 6st. 71b. m
the Metropolitan, and may have an outside
chance if Percival is engaged—no other
jockey seems to be able to induce him to do
his best. Short as the price was, the bag-
men showed a profit on Drawbridge’s race,
as indeed they did on every other, except,
perhaps, Persuasion’s. In the Parramatta
Mile, which was run in a thunderstorm, the
33-to-l chance Anorient (Sands of the
Orient —Id'yia), who is in none of the
big handicaps, romped home from Lady Clara
((> to 1), Fool's Paradise (8 to 1) and 15
others. Yallino (5 to 2), who belongs to
Mrs. P. 11. Osborne and has important spring
engagements, ran badly, but Bacchus pleased.
Burdened with Ost. 121 b.. and racing at a
distance and under conditions which did not
suit him, this horse of Kelso’s finished
strongly just behind the place-getters.
It is to be hoped that neither mishaps
nor “market considerations' will prevent
the meeting of Limerick, Commendation,
Gothic, Valicare, Fuji San and Amounis in
the Warwick Stakes at Warwick Farm on
Saturday. All six have done well on the
track —or had at the moment of writing—
and there is no apparent reason why they
shouldn’t all go to the post. If Boaster and
Ilionscup join in it should be the most
interesting w.f.a. race over the distance —
a milt —that Sydney lias seen for years. The
Mobartville Stakes, in which Manfred made
his bow, as a three-year-old, to the N.S.W.
public; the Campbelltown Handicap, in
which numerous Epsom fancies are engaged ;
and the Spring Handicap, which is expected
to throw light on the Metrop.—Pantheon

ably attractive programme. Anticipations :

If the form displayed at Williainstown on
Saturday is any criterion —and it ought to
be—this season’s Vic. three-year-olds are far
below the Manfred and Heroic standard.
Having let Ragazzo go unbacked for the race
he ran away with at Flemington, the I al-
kiner-Godby combination supported him
solidly (he closed at 5 to 2) in the Seaside
Handicap, Numenia and Marsias (sixes)
being also well in the market. The Wen-
sum (20 to 1) did the best of the bunch of
three-year-olds, but Translator (6 to 3) gave
him 391 b. and a beating; and Translator is
not within a stone of a mare like Per-
suasion. Numenia was third, the six fur-
longs being run in lmin. 13|sec.
Royal Feast’s showing in the Underwood
Stakes was decidedly disappointing. He is
trained at AVilliamstown, and though not
exactly in the pink of condition was thought
to be forward enough to win—at all events,
he had backing at sevens. The big colt was
third at one stage, hut faded out at the
finish into seventh place. Royal Charter (33
to 1) winning by a length from Byron (14
to 1), who had made most of the running.
Phonic (4 to 1) and Metcllus (15 to 1 )
dividing third place. Don Moon (5 to 1)
again cost Falkiner some wool-money, hut
the little fellow did not shape badly; the
mile was completed in linin. 40Jsec. When
Heroic and Royal Charter were trained to-
gether, Heroic was at least 211 b. better over
a mile; yet Royal Charter gave Royal Feast
ITlh. Byron’s showing was gratifying to
trainer Bill Burke, lnil this Cyllene More —
Durilla gelding hardly looks a Derby horse,
lie is in the Fpsom with 7st. 91b.. the
Metrop. and the Caulfield Cup with 7st. 51b.
and the Melbourne Cup with 7st. 31b.
The finish of the August Handicap was
fought out by Affirm (5 to 11, Sun Morn
(20 to 11 and Anan Louise ((i to 11, who
had all three failed in the Balaclava Stakes
at Caulfield a fortnight before —Affirm beat
the outsider by three parts of a length. Now
in his fifth season on the Vic. turf, this
'Maoriland-brcd horse —he is by Nassau —
Brayton—has never shown anything
approaching Cup form, although he is in
each Cup with 7st. 101 b. lie wasn’t nomi-
nated for the Metrop.

Silvius won another race for cattleman
Kidman at Victoria Park (S.A.I on Satur-
day—the fourth in succession. Though de-
scribed by one authority as merely a plodding
stayer, the English horse donkey-licked a
pretty good field in the Mayor’s Mile and
could obviously have cut at least a second
off the time, lmin. 41sec. He was conceding
lumps of weight to
everything except
Leahcim, from
whom he was re-
ceiving lib.; and
Leahcim, who has
won heaps of races
in South Aus.,
some at w.f.a.,
must be in form —
he was unlucky to
lose a handicap on
the first day of the
meeting. Fleming-
ton may suit Sil-
vios better than
Caulfield, but if the
liandicappers had
to do their work
over again they
would give him a
good deal more
than Tst. 51b. in
each Cu p. The
elder Scobie had a
profitable trip to
Adelaide with his
two-year-olds; Mis-
tral. a chestnut
filly by Cyklon—
Deneb. owned by E.

aide Grand National
Steeple was a pro-
cession which ended
in favor of Huja,
with Iviltender and
Don Anton next,
after Stuck Up,

fallen at the last
fence. Huja, Mis-
tral and Silvius
were favorites; in
fact, it was a favorites’ day.

“Eagle Farm”: An interesting record is
that of A. E. Davis, the Brisbane lightweight
jockey. Like Jimmy Pike, though ms
opportunities are greater, lie specialises in
winning the last race. In the course of 34
years Davis has ridden in 335. last races
and brought his mount home a winner in <S.
In 1920-21 he lost touch, and never landed
a last-race winner; the previous year, how-
ever, he was successful in 32 out of Jo
attempts. The statistical fiends have de-
cided that ten-bob tote tickets on all lus last-
race mounts during the 14 years-would have
returned the punter a £46 16s. lid. profit.

“Wang”: Most punters who have had a
bad day consider themselves sufficiently pun-
ished by the loss of their money. Not so
a man of my acquaintance who lives about
15 miles from Flemington. Coming home
from the last meeting—l was one of a party
in a car —we overtook him near Newmarket,
striding moodily along. “Jump up! the
driver said. “No.” the gloomy one replied;
“I’m going to walk.” “Not all that way
home?” queried my friend in astonishment.
“Yes, cv’ry damned inch of th’ way,” re-
joined the stricken punter. “I’ve done it
before and I’ll do it again. When a bloke
is fool enough to give his wages to them
loafers he deserves to pay for lij, and 1 m
goin’ to make meself pay for it. He re-
sumed his melancholy progress, muttering to
himself, “Walk, yer blanky fool, walk!

“Hasen”: The turf-expert of Melbourne
Argus has already collected some discon-
solate statistics from the new-born season.
In the first three weeks of it, he points out,
“33 races were decided in the metropolitan
area and only six favorites won.” In this
period (August 1 to 20) there were three
winners at 33 to 1, two at 25 to 1, two at
20 to 1, one at 15’s, one at 14 s, two at
12's, and three at 30’s —not a bad "bag
for three weeks. I understand that most ot
(lie bookmakers questioned to date have more
or less admitted that they just about "broke
even.”

“Thormanby” : The Gimcrack Stakes, one
of the oldest and most famous of English
two-year-old events, carried a special interest
for Australians this year, for the winner,
•Black Watch, was out of an Australian-bred
mare, Punkah 11., by Cooltrim from Drowsy.
Punkah 11. was bred at the Oakleigh stud by
11. S. Thompson; sold to J. B. Reid, of
Maoriland, she won the M.E. Oaks for him
before going to England. The Gimcrack
was instituted many years ago by the owner
of a flying filly whose name is perpetuated in
that of the race. Run annually at York,
it is the occasion for a traditional dinner of
the Gimcrack Club for which the owner
of the winner has to part up. It has gradu-
ally grown to be a semi-official gathering of
the Jockey (Club, and changes in that august
body’s racing policy are often foreshadowed
in (lie speeches.
* * *
“Centurion”; The glamor that a great
thoroughbred exercises over all who come
under the influence of his beauty and his
gamcness has been illustrated a thousand
times in the annals of sport. In “Gloam-
ing, the Wonder Horse,” Mrs. G, D. Green-
wood has written the story of a horse who
not only made history on the turf but was
the pet of everyone who came in contact
with him. Mrs. Greenwood's championship
amounts, indeed, to something near idolatry.
It is easy to smile at this fervent worship
of a tried animal friend, but most of us
have succumbed to it in one way or another.
And quite apart from her desire to perpetu-
ate the memory of her great horse, Mrs.
Greenwood has given the student of racing,
in her book, a veritable mine of racing
statistics and reminiscences. It is a pleasure
to read that Gloaming will be in clover till
the end of his days. Compare this para-
graph from the Perth Call : “It. is on record
in the oflices of the W.A.T.C. that three old
racehorses have died of starvation; one of
them was lan Or, winner of a Sydney
Cup.”
* * * *
“Paddock”; A casual glance over the
balance-sheets of some of the leading Aus-
tralian racing clubs shows some unsuspected
variations in profits. The A.J.C., for in-
stance, had to be content last year—the
year ended on July 31—with a modest sur-
plus of £385 12s. 4d. Bad weather hit the
summer and Anniversary meetings hard, and
the Doncaster Handicap and the Sydney
Cup .had to be postponed for the same
reason ; in addition, the new course at War-
wick Farm is still in the cash-consuming
stage. The total revenue from all sources is
given at £315,595 10s. Id., and expenses “in
regard to the conduct of racing” were
£263,551 18s. lOd. On the other hand, the
Y.R.C., with no tote revenue to assist,
cleaned up £31,920 for the year, though some
£ll,OOO was expended in improvements. The
club gave away £BB,lOO in added money, as
against £126,775 by the A.J.C., but had
fewer meetings. The South Australian .T.C.
showed an improvement of nearly £3OOO on
the 1925-26 profit, with £13,330 to the good ;
at the same time it spent nearly £12,000 on
course improvements. The tote is a great
help to all the Adelaide clubs. The Queens-
land T.C. was £6289 short of the 1925-26
surplus, but still did well with a profit of
£7.376 9s. 10d.. in spite of increases in
prize money and several meetings spoilt
by rain.

NO CRUELTY?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
' “ ‘Tin hare’ racing was welcomed by some who
condemned old-time coursing owing to the cruelty
to the hare. It is conceded that there is no cruelty,
but the welter of wagering is in excess of any similar
activity seen anywhere.”— Argus.
No cruelty, my masters! Note the slogan
That lily-whites the erstwhile bloody play;
No more the panting hare is a blood-and-
bone affair
Whose demise may trouble some S.T.C.A.
No cruelty! So come ye in your thousands
And with the merry books your wagers
lay;
Oh, it’s innocent to punt on ferocious hounds
that hunt
Nerveless prey.
No cruelty ! And pleasure ! And the profit
That may await in dealer Fortune’s deck!
Out there upon the green, flying dog and fleet
machine
Stage a sport that not the tend’rest nerve
may wreck.
No cruelty!.... And yet a doubt awakens
Within me as I watch the steady trek
Of the punting crowds galore —they will get
it, as before,
In the neck.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Phil Krug, veteran American middle-
weight, had his first Australian scrap at the
Sydney Stadium on Saturday night and made
a very good impression. One thing he did
was to give the local talent an object-lesson
in countering and cross-countering, an art
which the newer generation appears to be
unable to assimilate. Merv. Williams, his
opponent, is a line boxer and a dangerous
hitter, especially with a left jab. He out-
boxed and outhit the visitor in the first five
rounds, but subsequently had to take a lot
of right jolts to the incoming body and well-
timed right crosses to the head as he shot
his left to the dial. These were capital shots,
and Krug also satisfied the onlookers—and
Williams —that he has a wicked left jab him-
self. It was a very exciting fight, and gory.
The Yankee bled at nose and mouth in the
third round—incidentally, he refuses water,
except that he sniffs a little up out of a
squeezed sponge and lets it drain away,
taking the blood from the nostrils with it —
and in the sixth Williams came out of a
wild whirl also bleeding at nose and mouth.
Thenceforward they both distilled ruby
freely. In the eleventh a smart butt split
Merv’s left eyebrow, and both streamed gore
in the thirteenth, during which Krug was
very hard pressed. Wallis gave a well-
earned verdict to the Australian, whose
strong lead in the earlier rounds was not
overtaken, though Krug fought skilfully and
pluckily. Williams scaled list. 41b. and
Krug lib. less. The Australian was well
advised by his “corner.” In addition to Des
O’Donnell, his trainer, the sometime Bal-
main publican had the services of two other
publicans—Fred Kay, ex-cliampion welter,
now about 13 stone and prosperous, and Sid
Godfrey, ex-lightweight champion, rotund and
bald, but also well-to-do.

“Tom Cribb”: The idea that a bruiser
must be branded with a Hibernian-sounding
monniker before he can achieve greatness
(B. 18/8/’27) is discounted by a recent
battle in America for “the bantam champion-
ship of the world.” This was won by a
gentleman named Fidel la Barba from one
Johnny Bacca. Incidentally, it was an-
nounced after the fight that the winner was
leaving the ring to enter Stanford University,
there to take the degree of B.E. In Aus-
tralia the retiring pug. prefers the B.V.A.
* * * *
“Methuselah IV.”: The best fight I ever
saw was at Gawler (S.A.) ; the combatants
were Bill Pile, the town’s amateur cham-
pion, and an American negro. In accordance
with the conditions laid down by Bill, the
two w'ere shut up in a loose-box, without
seconds or a referee, and rounds were dis-
pensed with. Kingcraft, footwork and dodg-
ing were alike useless; only strength and
stamina counted. The fight ended with a
semi-conscious Bill leaning against one end
of the loose-box, the sides of which veere
covered thick in hair, skin and gore, and
an unconscious negro in the straw at his
feet. Bill’s victory cost him a couple of
weeks in hospital; the negro was never
able to enter a boxing ring again.
* M= * *
“Mitt Sllover”: A recent decision of the
New York Boxing Commission would seem
to indicate that the pug.’s waistline is about
to become as elusive as.the flapper’s. The
American authorities have lowered the belt-
line five inches, with the result that a blow
will not be now below the belt unless it
lands below’ a line drawn an inch above the
pelvis; this line is to be clearly defined by
a colored cloth line on the the boxer’s trunks.
It only remains to compel the boxer to dip
his mitts in whitewash before every round
to complete the foolish idea. The reason
given for the inhuman alteration —for it in-
creases the boxer’s risk of deadly injury
50-fold —is that foul punches are greatly
on the increase in fights, and it is desir-
able that they should be made more diffi-
cult of perpetration. But why stop at an
inch above the pelvis? As far as the person
punched is concerned, the safety-line could
he carried down to his boot-tops without
his running any graver risk of mayhem than
he will do under the new dispensation.

People who saw Clarence Weber (lost.
9Ub.) and Billy Meeske (13st. 101b.) wrestle
at Melbourne Stadium for “the championship
of the Commonwealth” voted it the dreariest
display of the season. Clarrie tried hard
enough, hut he is no showman, and the crowd
demand showmanship nowadays; and Billy
was too fat or too tired or something to do
himself justice. After three rounds of slow-
motion wrestling Clarrie scored a tame-look-
ing fall in the fourth with a three-quarter
bar. Bill nearly got even in the next with a
short-arm scissors, but the old fellow
countered with a head-scissors and cleared.
The tired and dishevelled-looking Clarence
spent most of the sixth trying to turn Bill
over with a Gotch and a half-Nelson ; but it
was Bill who turned his erstwhile instructor
over —i t happened in the seventh—and) pinned
him. The last was perhaps the least unex-
citing round of the bout or infliction. At
its conclusion, Bridges, unable (he said)
to give a decision on points in a “champion-
ship ' match, called the thing a draw.
Footbrawl
The last round but one of the N.S.W.
Rugby League's minor premiership saw
South Sydney maintain its lead at the top
of the table, a point ahead of St. George.
Both were successful on Saturday, and the
tussle between them this week should be>
lively; at their last meeting South won by
a whisker. South had a training gallop
against University; it scored 10 tries to 3,
the points working out at 42 to 11. Wearing
went over three times, and Blair kicked
six goals. Lane’s reappearance for Uni. did
not prove the success anticipated. St. George
had a tougher battle with Western Suburbs,
which had beaten the Illawarra side earlier
in the season, but got home by 17 to 8 after
AVest had led 8-0 at half-time. The loss
of Matterson from the three-quarter line soon
after the start handicapped the Westerners.
The game between Balmain and Eastern Sub-
urbs was a joyous carnival of stousli—the
referee was included —arrests, patrol-vans
and a measure of football. It was the
Tigers’ last game for the season—they have
the bye for the last round —and they made
the most of it. One man was sent off and
two were carted off —one with a dislocated
shoulder and the other with a fractured
jaw. The referee was hooted by the crowd
all through the second half and was “donged”
at the finish. A merry day; and—oh, yes!
—Balmain won by 11 to 3. Newtown con-
tinued recent improvement by beating Glebe,
13 to 9, in a dull match made worse by
the rain. Kessey showed to advantage for
the Blues, who, if they can beat East next
Saturday, will just scrape into the semi-
finals.
* * * *
In the Rugby Union semi-finals, Manly,
always a hard nut to crack in the wet, gave
University a doing, 34 to 22. Warsity was
a bit stale, having' played matches against
the Japanese and the combined G.P.S. during
the week, but the Village’s forwards were
in rare buckle, and
went from start to ■
finish. Louden
scored three tries,
as also did R.
Conn, a junior
back. Randwick had
all the better of
a game with
Y.M.C.A. which, in
spite of the wet,
was fast and at-
tractive, winning
by 19 to 12. The
winners made it a
forward game, and
their dribbling, an
almost unknown
art in Sydney foot-
ha 11, was very
effective. Manly
and Randwick will
fight out the final
on Saturday. The
G.P.S. season came
to a close with a
match against
United Services at
Uni. Oval, the lat-
ter winning by 14
to G. In AVaters,
the Service team
had a fine wing-
threequarter, while
Miners, from Dun-
troon, showed him-
self a centre of
class.
“P as t Gram-
mar”: The N.S.AV.
Rugby Union
Waratahs have arrived in Britain in good
order and condition. They will play
their first game overseas on September 7,
when they will take on Plymouth Albion,
one of the strongest of the AVest Country
clubs, in a practice match. The British
Unions are paying all expenses, including
the munificent allowance of two bob a day
for “wine money,” which is all the cash the
lilywhites will get out of their jaunt. Britain,
on the other hand, will pouch all the gate
receipts, which, if the team does as well
as it should do, should reach record figures.

Among the Soccer men Gladesville-Ryde
did well to knock New Dambton out of the
Gardiner Cup by 5 goals to 1. New Lamb-
ton began well, and the sides went at it,
hammer and tongs, till full-time went, with
the scores 1 all. Extra time was ordered,
and the heavy rain appeared to cramp the
visitors, for the metropolitans assumed com-
plete command, tacking on four more goals
to nil in short order. In the Metropolitan
premiership. Pyrmont’s scoreless draw with
the South Coast champions, Balgownie, was
something of a surprise.
The only senior game among the Austra-
lian-rulers was the semi-final between New-
town and Sydney at Erskineville. Sydney
was expected to give the local men a good go,
but was beaten by 65 points (9-11) to 81
(3-13).
Collingwood’s Magpies, just returned from
a good time in AVestralia, found their stamina
wanting in a particularly hard last-quarter
against Fitzroy on Saturday, and crashed—
-88 points to Roy’s 95. The defeat leaves
them level with Geelong and Richmond on
points won, but still ahead on percentages.
Geelong found Melbourne a hard nut to crack
up to half-time ; after that it ran away from
the Red Legs and won by 86 to 61. This
puts Melbourne temporarily out of “the
four,” and if Carlton can beat Richmond
next Saturday the “temporary” is liable to
be “permanent.” Richmond, after a fairly
even first half against North Melbourne, got
into its stride and left North standing—99
to 62. Hawthorn began the last quarter 3
points ahead of Carlton, and Carlton bar-
rackers began to shiver. But the Old Blues
bogged in with a will, sparing nobody, and
5 goals in almost as many minutes made
the issue certain: Carlton, 98; Hawthorn,
70. South Melbourne, on its own ground,
managed to beat Footscray, 74 to 70; and
Essendon outed St. Kilda, 72 to 48.
“Fitzcray”: The football “carnival” in
Melbourne did not pass off without a little
heartburning. objected to Vic-
toria having played a second XVIII against
the weaker States and thus kept its best side
fresh for the concluding match against the
Jarrahlanders. The Council decided that in
future each State should nominate 25 players
for “carnivals,” and select their teams from
these only. Incidentally, an Adelaide scribe
has criticised the sportsmanship of the crowd
at the deciding match. “AVlien the first bell
rang with AVestralia four goals in the lead,”
he wrote in the Advertiser, “there was
scarcely a sound from the crowd.... The
spectators were biassed in their applause;
not until ATctoria began to overhaul their
opponents in the third quarter was any great
TOOTHSOME.
“Several football players complain that they were bitten by their opponents.”
LOCAL BARRACKER: “How did you like our team?”
VISITING PLAYER: “Splendid, old man—best I ever tasted!”
enthusiasm displayed. Goals for Westralia
were received almost in silence, but a Vic-
torian score evoked stormy cheers.”
The Nineteenth Hole
“Divot”: Tommy Howard, the N.S.W.
pro., who recently cleaned up the Queens-
land open championship, is playing better
golf than ever. lie won a special purse for
pros, on Saturday in Melbourne, the event
being a sort of preliminary canter to the
Australian open ; he beat a field which in-
cluded the pick of Australian pros., doing the
two rounds in 77 each and finishing 3 up on
Isles (Vic.), who was bracketed second with
T. Heard (N.S.W.), Frank Popplewell being
next. On his present form, Howard should
bother the best of them in the open.
* * * *
“Mid-iron”: Bobby Jones continues to
produce startlin'* golf. In the American
amateur championship, after beating Ouimet
in the semi-final by 11 up, he went on to
polish off Chick Evans by 8 up, which
means that lie had only to play about half
the full course to vanquish his two most
formidable opponents. His stroke figures
throughout the tourney were five under par
and 10 under a four-hole average. As Jones
has won the British open and amateur,
as well as the same events in his own coun-
try, about the only titles left for him to
clean up are the Australian ones. What
about inviting him over?
* * * *
“Colonel Damurize”: Without regarding
the woman who plays golf as associate mem-
ber of a man’s club as anything but a nuis-
ance, I confess I have always been curious
as to what substitute the sex has for the
eloquent outpouring of feeling in which the
male member who finds himself bunkered
is -wont to indulge. Watching a woman’s
championship recently, I halted by a bunker
to hear what the fair occupant had to say.
Her shot out hit the top of the bank, and
fell back into a worse position than before.
I distinctly saw her lips shape to form the
“D” sound. But I was disgustingly disap-
pointed. “D—aiding,” she sighed, turning to
a sympathetic female at the other end of the
bunker, “isn’t that too horrid for anything?”
No more feminine golf for me!
* * * *
“Ploughman” : The grip which golf has on
the Great British Public is illustrated in
the accounts of the schoolboy championship
recently played in Edinburgh. Big crowds
followed the players all through the game,
and were violently partisan. In one of
the semi-finals a tall English competi-
tor named Ellis claimed a hole because
his diminutive Scottish antagonist, one
McLean, had smoothed away a wormcast
with his hand, instead of his putter. Ellis
was right according to the rules, but the
crowd took it very badly, jeering the un-
happy Southron during the rest of his
game and applauding every stroke of his
opponent. It is not surprising to hear that
the Scot won at the twenty-fourth. The
happening calls fresh attention to the many
fool-rules that obscure golf, rules that not
one player in a hundred knows or can in-
terpret. There is no reason on earth why
a player should not obliterate a removable
obstruction by sitting on it or eating it,
if he so desires.
Racquet and Bawl
“Base Line”: As expected, France made
short work of the Japanese in the Davis
Cup encounter. Cochet and Lacoste were
so superior to Ohta and Harada respectively
in the singles that the Japanese took only
nine games altogether. In the doubles the
Frenchmen won by 9-7, 6-1, 6-2. They will
now face the Americans to decide the Cup’s
destination for this year. America has kept
the trophy since 1920; France has yet to
score a winning bracket.
* * * *
“Butter” : Suzanne Lenglen has, rightly or
wrongly, acquired a reputation for tempestu-
ousness, built up on many public exhibitions,
including that notorious one at Wimbledon
which involved the Queen. But C. B. Coch-
ran, the French marvel’s manager for a time,
has been telling an English interviewer that
this is all wrong; Suzanne is “adorable.”
When he said that, Cochran was within
easy racquet-reach of Suzanne, and perhaps
lie felt it wise to walk warily. She lias
since shifted to another management, and
Cochran is said to have fervently declared
“never again,” so his opinion of the lady’s
adorableness has evidently wilted a little.
* * ❖ ❖
“Cut Shot”: South Africa has set Aus-
tralia’s tennis panjandrums a good example
by inviting Borotra, Cochet and Brugnon to
tour the Union next March; the Frenchmen
have accepted. The Afrikanders put us to
shame once before by sending a team to play
at Wimbledon and to compete in the pre-
liminary Davis Cup ties, two things which
our own tennis authorities were too tired or
too hopeless to attempt. Though beaten, the
Africans made an excellent showing, and
the experience gained will prove invaluable.
When it comes to inviting star players to
visit Australia, our heads seem to prefer
to bring over professionals and make their
path smoother by permitting local amateurs
to play with and against them In gate-money
matches.
Car and Cycle
“Ball-race”: The Tas. Motor-cycle Club’s
24-hour reliability trial at Launceston, the
first of its kind held in Tassie, ended in a
triumph for Mrs. M. Watkins. The lady, rid-
ing an Indian Scout, finished without loss of
points for time or the mechanical condition
of her cycle. The route covered was 400
miles over a tricky and hilly course. It is
the longest and hardest trial a woman has
yet completed in Australia, and the men she
defeated are subscribing for a special trophy
to commemorate her feat.

“Chevroford”: Who owns the oldest car
on the road in Australia? A Melbourne man
still trundles around in a llup. dated 1912.

Roost : There is a smile in tlie cabled
accounts of the reception given to Harris
Horder after his success in the U.S.- sprint
championship (B. 25/8/’27). The Ma State
Inke-pusher was crowned with flowers, photo-
graphed with past champions and paraded
round the track, "while the band played the
National Anthem.” Whether it was the Brit-
ish National Anthem or “My Country, ’tis
ol Thee,” is not specified ; anyway, both are
sung to the same tune, so it doesu’t matter
much. It is pleasing to note, however, that
the newspapers, departing from their custom,
are not claiming Horder as an American.
He is announced as “the first foreigner to
capture the title.”
=i= * * *
B.R.’ : The motor reliability trials re-
cently completed in England were a triumph
tor British machines. Britain retained the
international trophy, losing only 10 marks;
as the contest was held in the hilly Lakes dis-
-1 net the trials must have been sound ones,
and the easy win no fluke. Sweden was a
poor second, with a loss of 111; ' Germany
ran third, 346 marks to the bad. The only
Australian mentioned, one Melrose, is de-
scribed as having been “washed off his
machine” and awarded a gold medal —
whether for swimming or not isn’t mentioned.
❖ Jfc ;js
“Gore”: A variation of the motor-cycle
smash as Brisbane (B. 18/8/’27) knows it
was seen in the recent Isle of Man test.
One Simister, riding at a great bat, missed
a turn and went over a fair-sized cliff, down
which he rolled with his machine. The
luck of the game was with him, for he man-
nged to set back to the road with his jigger
only slightly damaged, and, mounting again,
bowled off, “kicking his offside footrest
straight as lie went.” After a long battle
to the finish, in which he cut down most of
the field, Simister ran off the course in the
final lap but managed to get into third
place. Evidently the Bulldog Breed is not
yet extinct.
* =!= * *
“Pincher”: Ever since cars became popu-
lar with the pinching brigade inventors have
been working on thief-proof devices for
locking- ignition and induction pipes. A
promising new one is English; it consists
of three letter dials which can be set in
13,000 combinations, much like the combina-
tion lock of a modern safe. With the lock
set, ignition cannot be switched on, nor
can a shutter which blocks the induction
bo opened, unless the combination as set is
known to the operator. That being the
case, and the dials being reset, a pull on the
switch control is all that is necessary to
return to normal working.
* * =!= *
Stunt”: Lengthy motor-car journeys
through strange lands and by unusual paths
are getting as wearisome as our old friend
the gentleman who was walking round the
world for a wager. One more notable than
most was L. L. Drader’s trip from Man-
chester to Calcutta in 80 days. Sea trans-
port had, of course, to be utilised to ferry
the car across the Channel and the Bos-
phorus. Otherwise the 8000-miles journey
through Asia Minor, Iraq, Persia and Belli -
clnstan to India was done on tlie car’s own
power.
Miscellaneous
“Borom” : Dog-dopers are among the horde
nf n-u-qsites who welcome the tin hare. To
speed ’em up they use cocaine or strychnine,
drugs which are_ much harder to detect in
the hound than in the horse. For stopping
cm the favorite dope is cannabis indica,
which slows up the action of the heart.
Another method consists of tying thin silk
threads round tlie toes; when the silk is the
same color as the dog’s hair it is much
harder to notice than might be thought.
I here are other ways besides these, and in
the aggregate they make the racecourse-
faker, with his cocaine and his electric bat-
tery, look like a raw amateur.
* * * *
“Aintree”: One regrets to read that two
dangers are threatening the tin-hare industry
in Britain. One is that there aren’t enough
dogs to chase all the tin hares now in view ;
the other that many bagmen, warned off
the racecourses by the Jockey Club, are
betting at “the hares” with calamitous
results to punters. The first could be got
over by manufacturing tin dogs to chase the
tin hares. An automatic device could pro-
duce a variation of winners unknown to
public or officials, and beyond an occasional
coat of paint the tin dog would cost nothing
for upkeep. And it would be only a step
further to the tin bookmaker. He, of course,
< tote °dds,” and as his feet
could be spiked or cemented into the ground
punters would be sure of finding him when
they came back to collect.
* * * *
Ike Mcßagg”: All this talk of coursing
brings to mind my old pal Izzy O’Leary.
He was born in Scotland, and this, with his
natural self-confidence, made him certain he
was a match at a bargain for any Scotsman
living. His special side-line was dog-dealing.
Hearing that the Master of Docli-an-Dhoris,
near Dunfermline, wanted a greyhound, Izzy
blew along with a fine specimen and said he
would take 50. The master wouldn't budge
beyond 15. Izzy and his hound went back
to Glasgow. Next day the dog developed
pneumonia and died. The mourner wired to
the Master that he’d accept the 15 if it were
sent in advance. To his surprise this was
done, and Izzy forwarded the corpse in a
box, whereupon he sat back and waited for the
row. There was no row. No communication of
any sort came from I)och-an-Dhoris. Months
later they met in the street. “How did the dog
turn out?” Izzy ventured. “Deid,” was the
reply. “Hard luck!” said Izzy. “Nane at
a’,” said the Master genially. “Ye see, Ah juist
pit it aboot that Ah had a feefty-poun’ tyke
Ah didna want, an’ wad raffle him at a poun'
a teecket. The raffle fillit in a day or twa."
“Gripes!” gasped Izzy. “But what did the
cove that won the raffle say when he found
the dog was dead?” “He kickit up an unco’
fuss,” quoth Docli-an-Dhoris, “sae Ah juist
gave him his poun’ back an’ told him he
could keep the puir tyke intae the bar-r-
-gain. Na, na; All’ll hae nae mon sayin’ Ah’m
close-feested.”
* * *
“Heine Shprintz” : Germany got a bit of
its own back at St. Colombes Stadium in
I’aris when German athletes vanquished
a team by 89 points to G 2. Kohn
won the 5000 metres for Germany in 15min.
3sec. (Nurmi’s best time is llinin. 28 l-ssec.),
and the German relay team of four men, run-
ning 400 metres each, won in 3min. 18 2-3sce.
—2 2-ssec. worse than the U.S. achievement
at the last Olympiad. But Martin, the
French middle-distance man, surprised Fritz
by beating Dr. Peltzer in the 800 metres,
done in lmin. 53 l-ssec. Peltzer it was who
astonished the English last year by beating
their best in lmin. 513-ssec. He did not
compete at the late Anglo-German meeting.

“Spikes”: An effort to discover who is
really the world’s champion sprinter among
the pros, will be made at the Melbourne
’Drome in February, with the Vic. Athletic
League in charge of affairs. Tim Banner will
be there; McLennan, of Maoriland, is com-
ing over ; and “inducements” are being offered
to Paddock, the American, and Chester, who
claims the British title. A £lOOO Sheffield
Handicap is included in the programme, as
drawn up. Paddock, by the way, is credited
HARRY HOPMAN, N.S.W. hard-courts
champion, one of the youngsters who
give promise of reaching the Davis Cup
class.
with having run 100 yards in 94secs. at. Los
Angeles last year. At Horsham (Vic.) in
January Banner got over the distance in
9fsec.
“Wal”: Some well-intentioned person has
been writing to Queensland newspapers de-
nouncing goat-racing as being cruel to dumb
animals. Knowing Rockhampton and other
fastnesses of the sport as I do, I am con-
vinced that the innovation has been wholly
beneficial to William. Every goat in the
business is regarded as a potential Wind-
bag, and is fed on the best his handler can
buy. When the Prime Minister was at
Rockhampton there wasn’t one animal
among the hundred or so put through their
paces for his amusement that didn’t look
well-nourished and -groomed, as lie remarked
himself. Before goat-racing came along half-
A. GEDDES, captain of Richmond, whose
return to its old-time form has been
one of the features of the Victorian
football season.
starved billies and nannies were a melan-
choly feature of the landscape in every N.Q.
township.
* * * =:=
“Billy th’ Goose”: I inns’ say th’ pro-
gramme o’ th’ Itoy’l Agra f’r its sports
meetin’ in Sydnee nex’ month ’as lef’ me
cold. They’s arrangin’ a tine turnout in one
way, w’at with bands ’n’ dorgs V ponies ’n’
orl that sort o’ thing; but not a word about
tli’ goats—that’s w’ere th’ ’eartbreak lies.
As I tol’ y’ th’ other day. I jus’ come down
fr’m Queensland, w’ere th’ game is goin’ a
perisher. Tli’ billies wuz th’ life an’ soul

kons ’e’s come ter get th’ strong o’ th’ noo
attrackslmn. Th’ talent sees their good
punters about coughin’ up enough t’ shift
their strings t’ Sydnee, ’n’ I comes down as
a’vance-agent. An' w’at do we find? Th’
joke’s blown to a bubble. But it ain’t goin’

* * * *
“Third Bagger”: So far it has proved
impossible to get a team from one of the
recognised baseball-playing countries for a
series of matches in Australia, if one passes
over the lightning tour of two bands of Ameri-
can professionals in. 1914. Now they all want
to come. Stanford and California universities
suggest visits next July and August; both
support very high-class teams. Japan also
proposes a tour, and so does Americanised
Samoa. Perhaps Australia would be all the
better for playing more baseball and less
cricket. In baseball, as in football, time is
the essence of the contract. In cricket—of
the Test-match and Sheffield Shield variety,
anyway—time doesn’t matter.
* * # *
“Ride-off”: James Ashton, Ma State
M.L.O. now in America, has been sounding
the U.S. polo authorities with regard to an
American tour of Australia. Their reply
was favorable, and the matter of expenses is
to be discussed after the Anglo-American
engagement at Westchester. The best-mounted
players in the world, the Yanks would pro-
bably win all their •matches in this country,
but the experience should prove priceless to
our players.
* s': !’.! *
“Laconian”: Little Notts, which was
struggling with Lancashire for the headship
of the English county championship by
latest accounts, has a very small population
to draw on compared with its rivals among
the Big Six. There are nearly five million
people in Lancashire and over four million
in Yorkshire. Taking out London, Middle-
sex contains a million and a quarter souls,
Kent over a million and Surrey nearly
a million. And all three home counties have
the bloated metropolis (pop., 44 millions)
to look to for players. The population of
Notts is a mere 641.000. No other county of
its size has a record approaching it for fine
sides and men who have made cricket his-
tory.
Business. Robbery,, etc.
“Grufydd”: Six years ago a season-ticket
association was formed in the N.S.W. Gov-
ernment Savings Bank, and the idea has
been copied by employees in other Govern-
ment departments and in business houses.
Advances are made for the purchase of boat
or train tickets; they are repayable by instal-
ments, plus an annual fee of 2s. and interest
at the rate at which the association borrows.
Started to help the lame dog, the plan has
developed into one for encouraging the impro-
vident to be more thriftless even than they
used to be.

“F.S.H.”: Sydney's thirst is man-sized.
One brewery’s average daily output of bottled
beer in the winter months is 8000 doz.; the
summer average is 18,000 doz. Its record
for a single day is 24,000 doz.
=s =:• * *
“Cuchulain”: Figures give some idea of
the butchery that occurred in Queensland
before the Government went through the
farce of declaring an open season for native-
bears. The first fur-skin sale in August
brought in 23,510 koala and 51,(MM) ’possum
pelts. The damage done by this type of
trapper is hard to assess. Their cyanide baits
are taken by stock, and the owners have no
redress; nor have tney any for the damage
done to cattle stampeded by trappers’ flares
and torchlights.
* * * *
“Toby C.” : There might be a thousand a
year in rabbit-trapping if trappers actually
received the prices mentioned in the market
reports, but they don’t. They rarely average
more than one-third of the top price quoted
in the weekly report. In a parcel of, say,
1001 b. of skins there may be only half a
dozen pelts graded as first-class. I recently
saw a parcel of 801 b. in which there were
only 21b. of first quality and about 101 b. of
the next-best. The parcel was sold at 3s.
a lb. all round, exactly a third of the top
price reached at the previous week’s sales;
and that trapper did well, as poor qualities
and damaged lines were 50 per cent, below
the average price.
if * * *
“E.S.S.”: I was riding along a lonely
road at the Back 'o Beyond when a voice
hailed me from the butt of a gidgee-trec at
a creek crossing. “Any tinware to mend? - ’
It was a strange cry in such a place, for the
last house I had passed was IS miles behind,
and the next was 12 miles ahead. “Old
billycans, pintpots—all sorts of tinware!”
I thought at first it was his way of saying
good-day; but he was actually at work
under that gidgee-tree with snips and solder
and iron. He was a wandering tinker, known
as “Kerosene-tin Larry,” whose orbit is wide
enough for a kingdom. Some caravan had
cast aside an empty kerosene-tin at the cross-
ing, and he was busy making it into little
patty-tins, which he would sell farther on
or exchange for rations.
if *■ * *
“A. Flat” : A big change has come over the
second-hand pianoforte business since the
Teutons returned in force. The four big B’s—
Beales, Broadwoods, Bi-insmeads and Becli-
steins —still command a good price on the
second-hand market, and Brinsmeads are at
a bit of a premium because they aren’t
made now. But a host of the other makes
can be bought for about half of their market
value a year ago—less than half in some
cases.
* * # *
“Philatelist”: Last year New Guinea
issued a fresh supply of stamps. _ The ss.
lot was to have been printed in olive-bistre,
and the 6d. in dull red-brown, but someone
blundered, and the sixpennies were the
same color as the crowns. Supplies were
snapped up by stamp-hounds; as much as
£lO was offered for a single specimen. When
the next issue was inspected the dealers
found themselves dished. The Government
had printed large supplies of the sixpennies
in each color.
* * * *
“F.G.H.”: The Southern European is
generally a good worker, but lie packs a
box of snaky tricks, and doesn't hesitate
to use them. A cocky in the Loxton (S.A.)
district let three Italians a contract for
the “mullenising” (levelling to the ground)
of 100 acres of scrub, most of it on drift-
sand country. The contract was duly com-
pleted, and for some time afterwards
the* farmer was congratulating himself on
getting his land cleared at a figure below
the usual price. Recent heavy winds swept
away his illusion, together with most of the
drift sand that covered the unremoved
stumps. Many of these were two feet high.
* sj* ❖
“Tongio West’’: The old Gippsland store-
keeper charged me only Is. Bd. for a pound
of butter, although I had seen him mark
Is. 9d. on the docket of a previous customer.
I asked the reason. “Coves who pay cash I
charge one and eight,” he said. “Blighters
who book their order I charge one and nine.
Crimson blanks who never pay at all —well,
they gutter pay two bob!”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
RENFREW saw the house, a vague,
shadowy shape, across the cleared
paddocks. In the blue thin-running
dusk, it had a quality of unreality, and the
light in the window was soft as a wavering
caudle-flame in broad day.
He limped towards it, a figure in a blue
void, out of which the attenuated white trees
at the edge of the forest thrust spectre-
pale.
The dusk deepened, and his figure merged
into it, became an inseparable part, a shape-
less, hurrying thing of the indigo darkness
that held signs of impending storm.
Renfrew avoided looking at that evil sky.
A night out of doors in the splintering forest
(for he must avoid the main highway to
the next township) was not pleasant to
contemplate. It was five days now since
he had broken gaol, and they had been days
spent in a hostile, alien world, where lie
had walked oppressed, bowed down, it seemed,
under some intolerable weight. And in
those days of stealthy flight lie had reached
an unalterable conviction that had its roots
deep down in those shameful prison months
—the conviction that life was a fiasco, a
rough-and-tumble game at which you had to
cheat in order to gain an advantage. There
was neither good nor bad, and there was no
morality, since morality was said to be per-
ceived obligation, and, lie did not admit
obligation. If you could get the best by
trampling your fellow men, then you
trampled them, or they would do the same
by you. Away with conscience! Away
with scruple! Away with pity, that most
devastating and weakening of all emotions!
From now on he would walk abroad the
enemy of every man who stood in his way.
He would not hesitate to take life if it
were necessary in his fight to retain free-
dom. What was killing? It was only the
possibility of uncomfortable consequences
that mattered. If you could kill and avoid
the consequences—why, then !. ...
He limped over the clear paddock witli its
yellow puddles as pale and shining as silver,
opened a little white gate, and went up a
straight path to the house, wondering appre-
hensively about its inmates. He knew that
he was taking a risk in seeking shelter, but
a contemplation of the night in front
appalled him, and lie was entirely without
food. Just after dawn he would be able
to seek out that short cut through the forest,
and make his way to the lonely bit of beach
where the Black River trickled into the sea.
Old Oscar would be waiting there with the
yacht. Two hours after dawn, he had said.
Good old Oscar the Swede, who was mainly
responsible for his success in escaping from
prison! Discharging a debt, old Oscar had
said, and it irked Renfrew now to remember
it, since he repudiated the existence of all
obligations. Well, Oscar and lie would go to
the Islands, that happy hunting-ground for
lost men, and lie would make a fresh start.
Renfrew laughed to himself as he came to
the end of the path. A fresh start need not
necessarily mean a “good” start, but either
kind would be assisted materially with the
aid of ready money. Money! It should be
easy enough to obtain everything that yon
wanted, given this lack of scruple. Mean-
while it was food he wanted.
A little girl came walking from the house.
She came with a little side-stepping, jerky
gait, her hands spread delicately out, touch-
ing the tops of bushes now and then. Her
little oval face was frail and sad.
“Is there anybody at home?” asked Ren-
frew, in his harsh, metallic voice.
“Yes,” said the child in a soft sing-song.
“But I can’t see—l can’t see.”
Renfrew crossed the verandah. The door
was open, and he looked straight into a
living-room, lit by a dim lamp.
There were four people by a smoky fire.
A slender girl, her ashen-pale hair like
molten pewter, was bending over some scar-
let knitting. An older, plain-faced woman
plaited raffia strands with quick, unceasing
fingers. A shaggy, thick-set man was lean-
ing back, his knees apart, a small flute at
his lips. At his feet crouched a frail wisp
of a woman, singing under her breath.
There was silence as Renfrew stared in.
They seemed to be so many people. Fie put
his hand in his pocket with a nervous ges-
ture and felt the small revolver there. Then
suddenly he was seized with an inexplicable
sense of ridicule that changed to a feeling
of despair.
“Good night,” he said sharply, and as he
spoke the first dull drops of rain flattened
themselves against the ground, and the sky
was split in two.
“Night." said the man with the flute, that
made a little moaning sound as he drew it
back from his mouth, wiping it carefully.
“Could I beg shelter here?” asked Ren-
frew. “A shed—anywhere. T have walked
a long way without food, and by the stormy
look of the sky”
“Come in,” interrupted the man. “You’re
just in time. Sit down in the family circle-.
The little one is out calling her kitten.”
Renfrew closed the door, shutting out thi
crowding, menacing shadows of the night,
and sat down with a feeling of unease. Hid
these people know who he was —a fugitive
lrom justice? Was this a trap: He knew
that lie had been seen in the district, and
that his photographs had appeared in the
Papers. And this house was on the edge of
civilisation, and there was a telephone on
the wall. There was silence in the room.
Suspicion Jay between him and these people
like a wall.
The oldest woman spoke. "We are blind,
she said, in an unemotional voice.
Not "I am blind,” but "We are blind !"
Renfrew's heart gave a sickening leap and
seemed to turn right over.
“All of you?” he asked in a whisper, and
the mail nodded indifferently.
Renfrew looked around the room, wiping
the brim of his hat with his sleeve. It was
comfortable enough with pictures and gay
hangings. And the lamp alight! That puzzled
him. Why, when it could not send a beam
of lisrht into the incredible darkness of their
world?
Tiie shaggy man seemed to read his
thoughts.
“We have the lamp lit as a sign of habi-
tation to weary travellers,” he said simply.
“Besides, sometimes a visitor comes—you
never know.”
Yes, feasible enough. t But Renfrew nearly
laughed aloud at the irony of it all. Five
blind people and none to gainsay his wishes.
Five feeble, crying souls at the mercy of a
dark one! He could have shouted aloud like
a villain in an old-fashioned play, for he saw
his own soul now as a wizened little hob-
goblin rubbing its hands together gleefully.
He saw them there in the soft radiance of
the lamp, moving sometimes with quick but
faultless footsteps, knowing every inch of the
room through long familiarity. The child
crept in and crouched on the mat, fondling
a thin, wet-haired kitten. How did they
picture him? he wondered. What strange
personality had they woven round his un-
bodied voice? He, with his long, gaunt figure,
his restless dark face, with bushy eyebrows
A NARROW ESCAPE.
BIGGS (after the wedding) : “I suppose you found it hard to see your daughter off?”
HIGGS: “Yes, pretty hard. Between you and me, we were just losing hope when the
missus landed this chap for her.”
over black searching eyes—the clever face of
a man who a year ago had held a place in
the world and lost it in a single mad moment
with a stroke of the pen! Forgery, the
gentleman’s crime ! Yet were these not more
to be pitied than he? Pity! No there was no
pity left in the world. He had repudiated
it long ago.
Suddenly there was a hollow crash above
the turmoil of sound outside.
“The bloodwood by the gate. Bruno,” said
the frail woman, startled.
“Yes. it is that, Rose,” said the man
indifferently.
“How do you know?” asked Renfrew
doubtfully.
“If you haven’t one thing you have
another.” said the plain woman, lifting her
queer, light eyes. “But sit you up to the
table now. The child will bring in clean
plates. We were only finished our meal, and
had sat back by the fire for a bit.”
Renfrew sat up to the table and ate. glad
that his wolfish appetite could pass un-
noticed. All the time his eyes were roving
—roving while he wondered how he could
best turn the present situation to his advant-
age.
"I would like you to know me as more
than a voice." he said suddenly with a charm
that had once served him well. You are
indeed good to me! Picture me a healtny
florid man nearing middle-age, inclined to
be stout, blue-eyed and fair-haired, with a
passion for collecting botanical specimens.
I am going towards the ranges early to-
morrow morning in search of certain flora.
I am happy doing this." „
"Yet your voice does not sound happy,
broke in the frail woman who sat at the
shaggy man's feet.
"Ah. does it not?” Renfrew stared at her,
his frown deepening. “There are depths ot
unplumbed sorrow in the heart of an amateur
botanist,” he said lightly.
Back at the fire he saw the eyes ot the
man Bruno, glazed, and brown, like an
earthenware teapot, lifted to his.
“1 ought to have told you,” lie murmured
—“one of us is not blind.”
“Which?” asked Renfrew dully, with a
queer feeling of foolishness.
"Ah, which?” The man chuckled, evi-
dently enjoying his joke. “We always spring
this on passers-by, because it is not obvious
unless. Sometimes we set them guessing,
and few guess right. Is it I or Agatha
there with the grey in her hair by now,
Rose hefe, my little wife, or Mary? She
knits scarlet wool. Is it not, Mary?”
The girl looked up, and her face was as
fair as a young rose.
“I can see it,” she said —“as red as the
breast of a robin is said to be.”
Beads of sweat rose on Renfrew’s fore-
head. He felt that they were mocking him
softly there. One of them with sight! Impos-
sible —they looked the same —they moved the
same ! Yet was not that the explanation of
the lighted lamp, the explanation of their
untroubled existence in this place?
Outside the wind lashed the trees and the
rain spat against the panes.
The plain woman called Agatha began to
tell a story in the interested voice of an
invalid who takes a certain pleasure .in re-
counting her ills.
“There was a family of us,” she said re-
signedly. “Bruno and a dead one and me,
and Mary coming away at the foot. Bruno
learned a trade early and how to play the
flute. He married Rose before we came here
five years ago. The child, she was brought
from an institute by Rose. Ah, they would
be cold places, those institutes for little cry-
ing bairns. A family of us, dear God!”
“The sins of the fathers!” The words
came to Renfrew in a whisper. He did not
know whether he had heard them or whether
they had birth only in his own mind. The
lips of the girl with her scarlet knitting
moved, but she was whispering: “Three
plain, three purl, slip one, knit one.”
“We are happy in this little world,”
went on the woman in her flat voice. “We
see as plainly as you. Our eyes are in the
tips of our fingers, in our ears. The unblind
one, through always living with us, has our
senses too —does what we all do, so as to feel
with us and understand. The tradespeople
call, and we walk down into the township
sometimes. There is the telephone that con-
nects us if anyone molests us. We all have
our work. Rose’s fine crocheting brings in
nice little sums. Ten pounds yesterday,
wasn't it, from the shop, Rose? Yes, all of
that.”
Renfrew was silent. He felt his presence
brooding over them, large and demoniacal.
Then :
“To pity, that would be an impertinence.”
lie said, awkwardly.
“That is 50..” said Bruno, and. drawing
the little flute from his pocket, made vague
sounds that seemed to be a' sobbing obligato
to the rumble of the storm outside.
The wind was blowing out of a great gulf
of darkness. Renfrew, strung to a pitch of
intense consciousness, seemed to hear the
mad neighing of horses about it, and thought
of the Valkyries. His discomfort quickened.
His thoughts goaded him. The night was
black, but he lett that ins soul was blacker
Curse them all! They were all blind— all
poor creatures groping helplessly!
Of a sudden he got up and opened the
window wide, and the lamp, as he had
known it would, flared up, then went out.
The room was in darkness now. It was the
time for the unblind to betray herself—or
himself. But there was no movement in that
huddled circle round the fire.
“A wind blows in from somewhere,” said
Rose, fretfully.
“It is cold,” said Bruno. “Yes, has the
window become unlatched?”
“Yes, that’s so,” said Renfrew. “It has
blown the lamp out.” He lit it, and could
not be sure whether or not a thin smib
flickered across the face of the oldest woman.
He watched them gather up their things
with remarks on the lateness of the night,
Mary went away down the passage trailing
her scarlet wool. Rose and Agatha each
took a hand of the weary child. Bruno went
to a drawer in a cupboard, and pulled it out.
Tenderly he laid his little flute down, but
not before the sharp eyes of Renfrew had
seen a little bundle of notes tied with
elastic, thrust into the corner. The plain-
faced woman’s words came back to him.
This was the money for Rose’s fine crochet-
ing. Fools!
He slept uneasily in the made-up bed at
the side of the dead fire. Because the in-
mates had no eyes, it seemed that the house
had them all. Strange eyeballs glared at him
from the ceiling. Blue and green irises
moved along the walls with dilated pupils.
He dared not get up and go to the drawer
where the money was kept, because now with
the stillness that often follows a storm the
slightest movement would have been heard in
that house where the sense of hearing was
so acute.
It was a pallid, sickening dawn, threaded
through with the thin, muffled cries of cocks.
Renfrew looked at the wan sky, listening
to faint stirring sounds in the house, remem-
bering that they had told him that they arose
early because there were cows to milk. He
went out to the pump in the yard and
stamped round on his cold feet. When he
returned there was a fire alight and the
smell of coffee. The girl Mary stood there,
a little set smile on her pink mouth. Bruno
sat on a chair struggling into heavy boots.
Renfrew saw that the drawer was open
enough to allow the insertion of a hand.
The money was in the corner. It was now
or never. He had been a fool not to risk
it in the night. Money! He must have
money. Even Oscar, who was thriftless,
would expect him to have it.
Mary had her face turned to him, her
fingers fumbling with a cup. Her blue eyes
were open wide in a fixed stare. In a second
Renfrew had moved his hand,
and the notes lay in a tight
little roll in his pocket. He
sat down, his knees sagging,
and reached for the coffee cup
which the girl had handed with
a little fumbling movement,
spilling some of the contents
into the saucer. Bruno went
out across the yard, stumping
with a stick, calling “Cushie!
Cusliie! Cushie!”
Renfrew sat on. There was something
indescribably sad about the pink and white
face of Mary. It was as lonely as a great
waste washed with dawn. The man felt
something flooding his being. It was pity-
pity flowing through him like a great wave,
touching his lips with bitterness. Pity of
the strange house with its rustling noises—
the women with their resigned faces, the
shaggy man Bruno with his childish joking.
Pity! He had thought that stilled for ever.
Now on the back-rush of it came an intoler-
able tide of shame.
Renfrew stumbled to his feet. No, he
could not do it! There was something that
he owed to himself. That was the good or
the bad—whether you were true to that
self! He walked across the room and
opened the drawer noiselessly, thrusting in
the notes.
“What are you doing?” asked the gin
curiously.
“Finding something of myself that I had
lost,” he said in a shamed voice.
lie went to the door, his head bent —to
the door of the house of the blind, where he
had discovered afresh the indestructible
livingness of pity and shame that he had
thought dead.
He fumbled for the girl’s hand as she
stood there wide-eyed, and his lips brushed
it, even as he sneered at himself for his
melodrama. There was a salt pricking in
his eyes as he struck into the gloomy forest-
path that led to -the tidal river and the sea
and the hope of a new life.
The girl sat on the step, her chin in her
hands.
“Poor soul.” she whispered, and smiled a
desolate smile.
She bent down with a little shake of
impatience and examined a tiny hole in the
corner of her apron with meticulous care.
“I must patch that to-night,” she said.
“But the lamp-wick needs a trim.”

Rexona Girls arc world-famous for their beautiful skin and hair. To be a Rexona Girl
is to use only Rexona Soap and enjoy that natural beauty of the skin and hair which
cannot he imitated, but can be obtained by its regular use.
Ordinary toilet soaps do not assert this influence. Many of them contain free alkali,
which tends to dry the skin and destroy its delicate texture. Even the best of such soaps
can only cleanse; they cannot heal and protect the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the same soothing, healing and antiseptic balms as Rexona, the
Rapid Healer, the value of which in the treatment of skin affections is known throughout
the world.
Simply use Rexona Skill and
Facial Soap regularly once or
twice a day, and see if it does
not quickly soothe and cleanse the
pores, lessen the tendency to
pimples, and leave the complexion
clear, fresh and velvety.

“Fore!”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
RED morning lights the fairways;
The weary night-winds go
Along the lightening airways
To vales the brown owls know.
The hills are clear and tender
Against the glory where
The wakened sun, in splendor,
Lifts with a royal air. . . .
And peace greets him who reckons
Life’s worth in little things—
The distant green that beckons,
The little ball that sings.
The world seems wide and wondrous
When far the fairways roll,
And though no plaudits thund’rous
Greet him who wins that goal.
Towards the white sphere, winging
Curves when he drives it true,
Something serene is bringing
The joy. the gypsies knew,
Which makes Life’s small things greater,
Its great things less and less
Than those the wise Creator
Wove through its loveliness.
The currawong’s sweet chorus
That mocks the magpie’s call
Rings down the links before us
Which, like Life’s pathways, fall
Or lift ’neatli curving wonder
Of sky and night and day;
Deep in the valleys under
The shadows hide away:
And Youth and Life and Morning-
Shout to the clouds that soar
Against the blue their warning.
Their challenge clear of “Fore!”
Not for the fretting labor
Of Life Avas mankind made,
Just to outstrip his neighbor
In battle or in trade.
In a more god-like manner
Than seeking fortunes wrung
In foul play ’neath a banner
By some oppressor swung,
Man came from the beginning
To stand devoid of fear,
And on his swift, sphere spinning
To speed his spinning sphere.
The blue skies are the limit
To one whose dream aspires,
And no false thought can dim it
Or dull his ardent fires.
Nor failure’s pangs deter him
Through the long day, until
The sunset comes to spur him
To one last strokp of skill.
Ah! Life is Youth at morning
When Dawn has swung her door
Wide open. Night’s power scorning,
Shouting his challenge. “Fore!”

Diversions of a Bush School
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PHEGAN had many troubles to contend
with in the Old Barn School. Most of
the barn was used for storing maize and
potatoes, and at threshing time the noise
interfered with lessons. When the machine
wasn’t going, the men talked and laughed
and shouted orders to one another. Some of
their remarks made us laugh, and when we
lauglfed we got the cane.
We were rather cramped in one end of
the front skillion at harvest-time and a bag
curtain was hung across it to confine our
interests there. In other seasons we were
fairly comfortable in the big central part of
the barn. But there was only a batten gate
across the front. As it was in bad repair and
dragged on the ground it was closed only at
night. Phegan was afraid of breaking it, in
which case he would have had to mend it. So
the fowls and ducks came in. Now and again
the cart horse made a tour of inspection
and occasionally a couple of poddy calves
intruded. They were disconcerting beasts,
for Bowler neighed at Phegan for a feed of
corn, and the poddies nosed about the infants
looking for milk.
It was the duty of Peter Possum, the
blackboy, to hunt out all wandering livestock.
But Peter wasn’t always equal to the job.
A big white sow mooched in with a litter of
young pigs, and when Peter went pig-lmnting
with a chipping hoe the grunters disorganised
the classes and upset the stools. The young
pigs scattered, and when Peter darted after
them the anxious old sow w r ent after him.
Then Phegan went to his assistance and we
were treated to the spectacle of seeing a pig
getting caned in school. The lively diver-
sion was enjoyed by everybody except the
teacher.
When the animals had been expelled and
the furniture re-adjusted he directed a scin-
tillating eye on a big boy who was still
grinning at the fun that the intruders had
provided.
“That’s the second time you’ve misbehaved
to-day, Tom Fallon,” said he. “As you seem
to be amused at pigs, you deserve to see a
little more of the beasts. So put your book
down and go and shut them in the sty.”
Phegan was a rigid disciplinarian. At the
same time his methods of dealing with boy
delinquents were designed to benefit'himself
as much as, if not more than, anybody else.
He looked across at a small heap of
unhusked corn that lay in one of the
straddles, then turned to another boy—a
short, chubby youth with red hair and brown
legs.
“Charlie Pickles,” he said, addressing him
in a tone of withering reproach, “your copy-
book is filthy. You ought to be ashamed of
it, a boy of your age. Stop in and husk two
hundred cobs of corn. That wall take the
ink off your fingers and give you time to
meditate on the virtues of cleanliness and
nhatness.”
The intrusion of the swine had ruffled Mr.
Phegan’s temper; and that was a time when
we had to be very careful to avoid unpleasant
tasks.
As we were going out for dinner Mrs.
Phegan entered with a complaint that there
was no wood chopped and that the water-butt
was empty.
“Halt,” cried Phegan instantly.
He went along the line till he came to
Henry Cobb, a freckle-faced youth with
sturdy shoulders and muscular arms.
“Your errors in sums this morning showed
a lack of attention to your work, Henry.
That’s a sign of laziness, and laziness must
be remedied with stimulating exercise. Go
up to the kitchen and subtract one axe from
two that you’ll see standing in the coinei
and multiply chips with it at the woodheap
till you’ve cut a barrowload of sticks for the
fire.' Maybe that will learn you to calcu-
late." . , ,
As Henry stepped out with solemn coun-
tenance Phegan moved a little farther down
and stopped in front of Jack Thompson. The
bright look in that youth's face immediately
vanished. , _ ,
“I caught you copying to-day, Jack ihomp-
son. It escaped my memory till this minute.
Copying is stealing, Thompson, and stealing
is one of the black sins that benefit nobody
but the devil. Sin must be punished to give
honesty a chance. So go you now with Mrs.
Phegan and carry ten buckets of water from
the river before yon eat your dinner. That
will remind you of the Ten Commandments,
and of the one in particular —‘Thou shalt not
steal'.” „ , ..
Then, to the rest of the expectant line:
“Left, right, march !. ... Halt!.... Right-
about-face ! Don’t turn round like a bul-
lock team, Johnny Cobb. Stand at ease !....
1 )ismiss!”
The only two who were never punished in
school were Dinny and Agnes Phegan. That
was not because they were favored above the
rest. Besides their filial respect, which kept
them out of much trouble that the others got
into, they were two of the best scholars.
And that was because they were helped in
their home studies at night by their indul-
gent parent. But Phegan said it was because
they were fond of reading, and that was
true. too. , , „ ,
110 liked us all to have books for home
study and he liked to be commissioned to
buy them.
On Friday afternoons the boys were given
military drill. Sometimes they had it twice
a week —it depended on the state of
Phegan’s woodpile. In the meantime the
girls were engaged at sewing, knitting and
darning—mostly for Mrs. Phegan. The help
she got from the class in having her patch-
ing and button-sewing done, and aprons, pil-
low-slips and sucli-like made, enabled her to
give her time for the instruction of the
girls. .
The military manoeuvres were executed m
a fashion that at least served a useful pur-
pose for the instructing officer. The boys
were ranged up on the marble-ground in
front of the barn, where Phegan inspected
them, commanded those who had coats on to
take them off, and weeded out a few that
were unfit for active service. The rejects
were spread about the schoolroom so that
each boy would be by himself and given sums
or composition to keep him busy.
“Numbers!” cried Phegan when prelimi-
naries had been completed.
“One —two—three” —and so on from end
to end.
“Odd numbers step back!
“Form fours! Lace your boot up, Curly
Spencer, or you’ll be falling over yourself.
Right turn !.. . . Mar-rch !”
We marched down the track through a
strip of jungle and for half a mile beyond to
the big forest, being halted at last where
plenty of dry wood was strewn about. _ Gen-
eral Phegan inspected us again and delivered
a short address on military tactics, camping
and campaigning, intermixed with sage re-
marks regarding the best woods for burning
and cooking purposes and the lasting quali-
ties of back logs.
“These are subjects of importance to every
person in the bush, whether lie’s a farmer,
drover, carpenter or Murrumbidgee whaler.
All want a fire and a dwelling of some sort.
Now, dry gum sticks are good fuel, and
make a healthy fire to sit around on winter
evenings. Its smoke has the sweet tang of
Australia in it. The timber is valuable for
numerous purposes. ’Tis hard, tough and
durable ; but don’t take gum for firing when
you can get ironbark or box. Forest oak is
good, too, but wild apple—that big shade
tree over there, known scientifically as Ango-
phora —gives a poor heat and burns away
quickly. It makes a nice ash for white-
washing the fireplace and hearthstone, but is
no good for baking bread or boiling the pot
or cooking a damper.”
The discourse was interrupted by Curly
Spencer putting up his hand.
“Well?”
“Please, sir, you’re standin’ on a snake!”
Phegan leaped three feet in the air, and
dropped his hat. His eyes bulged as he
looked round from a safe distance at the
world-old enemy. Somebody giggled.
“’Tis no laughing matter,” growled Phe-
gan. breathlessly. “It might have bitten
me.”
“ ’Tain’t poisonous,” said Ern Green, who
knew all about reptiles. “It’s only a green
shake.”
“That doesn’t make its bite appreciated
any more than yours would lie,” said Phegan,
searching for a suitable stick.
Ern Green stepped forward, snatched the
snake up by the tail, and, swinging it round
like a stockwhip, cracked its head off. The
performance raised him to the pinnacle of
a hero in the eyes of his fellows. Mr.
Phegan smiled approvingly, and stroked his
whiskers in a meditative manner for a
moment.
“It must have come from the bit of hollow
log I was standing against,” he surmised.
“Hollow logs make good burning, and good
dog-kennels when they're big enough, but
you want to be careful in picking them up.
They’re great harbors for snakes and centi-
pedes and scorpions. Always mind that; and
when you’re picking up wood, don’t put
your hand under a log or sheet of bark.
Now, then, shoulder arms!”
Each cadet picked up a lump of wood
or a bundle of sticks. Any boy who picked
up a small stick when a big one was handy
was reprimanded for shirking his obvious
duty. Then we fell into line again.
“Right about —march!” was the next
order.
We marched back to headquarters, all
heavily armed with firewood—all except
Phegan. He paced alongside, carrying a
long gum-stick to kill snakes with. He also
used it for pointing at trees to illustrate
a disjointed discourse on timbers, till the

kitchen.
“Stack arms!”
We stacked them neatly, were commended
for efficiency, and were about to be dis-
missed Avlien a girl ran up and said that a
cow was bogged in a small water-hole below
the barn.
Phegan looked suspicious. He had left the
girls and small boys at work in school. “llow
did you find that out?” he asked.
“Please, sir,” said the girl, “we heard a
hen cackling in the paddock, and Mrs. Phegan
sent me down to find the nest and I found
the cow.” . ,
“Get a rope, Henry. Left turn, quick
march!”
The cow was a wild-eyed brindle. When
we marched down to her assistance she
seemed to think we were the cause of her
misfortune, and struggled to get after us.
We were draAvn up in line in front of her.
all ready for a tug-of-war. Ern Green las
soed her round the horns and the rope was
run out along the line of boys. Phegan gave
instructions and exhorted them as if he were
driving a team of bullocks. The boys pulled
their hardest. Brindle heaved and bellowed
in angry protest. With Ern Green at her
rudder and the weight of twelve boys tugging
at her head she was soon pulled out of the
sticky mud.
Phegan slipped the noose off her horns.
She struggled half on to her knees, and
before he could get back she swung her head
round unexpectedly and knocked him back-
wards into the hole she had just left. With
the thankless perversity of cows she then
rushed at the boys Avho had pulled her out,
and robbed them of the fun that Phegan was
providing. Some dodged behind trees, others
scrambled on to low branches like scared
’possums. From their safe retreats, they
cheered and yelled and laughed, Avliilst
Brindle trotted indignantly away to the
bottom corner of the paddock, where she
stood like a crazed beast shaking her head at
anything that moved.
Mr. Phegan, now a disreputable object for
a dignified pedagogue, pulled himself out of
the bog and blew his whistle.
The boys fell into their places again, each
wearing a comically strained expression from
his efforts to look serious. Nothing annoyed
Phegan more than to be laughed at. In his
present condition he was nearly as dangerous
as Brindle. One or two peculiar noises like
half-strangled hysterical giggles made him
stare ferociously for a minute before he
rasped out the order to return to the play-
ground.
It was time for home then, and the troop
was sent off abruptly—without thanks.

The Reader.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DOWDEN, the proof-reader, sat where he
had sat for six nights of every week for
the last five years. His Avas the third
desk from the door in the circular reading-
room of the Morning Globe. There were
eight other desks, at each of which sat a
counterpart of himself, a man over the middle-
age, going bald, sallow-faced, untidy. So much
alike were the lot of them in a general way
that the Morning Globe seemed to have de-
manded a standard of appearance in its
readers, as well as standard abilities. Every
night they sat there, riveting their eyes .to
the long proof-sheets, listening to the droning
and chanting voices of their youthful off-
siders, correcting compositors’ errors, setting
right solecisms and mistakes in punctuation.
Each desk was separated from the next by a
thin partition, so that where he perched on
his high seat the head and shoulders of the
reader were hunched forward out of sight.
They all had wives, a rather important
condition insisted upon by the Morning
Globe. To most of them their wives were
nothing—sinks down which they dropped
their wages at the end of the week. With
Dowden it was different; he thought of her
every night. His work had become mechani-
cal to him; the massed, hopeless-looking
figures of the commercial page and the jargon
and childish manner of the sporting were
as familiar as his hands. Only semi-con-
sciously he listened to the boy beside _ him
calling over the market reports, the weights
for Randwick, “Spartan’s” tips. A long-
subdivided section of his brain recorded the
fact that tin is still rising, and eggs still
falling; that Famous had hurt a fetlock
and was resting; that Slug Franks was in
training and eager for a fight with anyone
his weight in the State. These things he
recorded, as he noted literal errors, without
effort. He had been reading proofs in one
part of the world and another since he was
a boy, and now he was forty-nine. Getting
on. The boys, Bob and Harry, were 18
and 19. They had done well for themselves,
winning their scholarships and getting to the
University so early. Smart boys; they were
going to be doctors. He himself had not
been able to do much for them. He had
done what he could; they had had the few
hundred he’d been able to save in spite of
his wife. He knew, as sure as he sat there
on his seat, that what he had heard about
her in the last five years was quite true.
He even knew the man; Fotherington, the
city traveller who stayed at the boarding-
house next door. There had not been any
straight-out information. No one had ever
come to him and said: “Fotherington goes
into your house every night. ... I have seen
him going.”
No one had ever said anything like that
to him, but he knew it all the same, and so
did every one of the other eight men sitting
round the room. They all knew it. They
didn’t say anything, but he knew that they
knew. He noticed how they looked at him.
Only the night before, when they Avere having
their usual eleven o’clock coffee, one had said
to him, “Why, you’re getting quite a shine
on top, Dowden! Worry?” It Avas said
jokingly, but he knew well enough what
Avas meant. There Avere always little thrusts
like that, veiled things, innuendo. They all
knew, had known for years. For four or
five years now they’d been secretly waiting
for him to put on his coat in the midst of
the night’s AV’ork and rush home to catch his
wife and Fotherington. Wouldn’t they hav-e
laughed if he had done it! But long ago he
had fought down the temptation to do it;
he would not giye them the satisfaction of
that sneer. No; some night something
would happen, and he would go early and
catch the pair of them. His muscles, flabby
from long years of disuse, tried to harden
now at the thought of that long-deferred
revenge.
The head reader thrust his face into the
cubicle, unconsciously speaking in a sharp,
loud voice to make himself heard above the
ceaselessly-droning voices and the clatter and
roar of the printing machinery surrounding
the room: “Henderson’s sick.... Rush of
blood, or something. ... Will you take his
proofs?”
“Certainly, certainly,” Dowden said.
“Certainly, Mr. Fysch. Sick, is he? I’m
sorry. I’m very sorry. I’m very sorry
indeed.”
He was still muttering when the head
reader had returned to his desk. Hender-
son’s proofs began to come to him, the
leaders and special articles and some news
items. The change threw his brain out of
its routine thinking; he was even able to
ponder on the paradox of the sporting pages,
which everyone read, being in small, difficult
type, while the leader, which no one read,
was fine and clear. He noted with satis-
faction that some person in Melbourne had
stolen a foundation stone, and that three
thousand Chinese, a race he detested, had
been drowned in a tidal wave. For half an
hour he read without a thought of his wife;
then a thought came: Perhaps, after all,
these rumors....
“Dowden!”
The voice was large and cheerful, breaking
into the reading sanctuary from the door-
way. It was Phillips, from the sub-editor’s
room, stubby, rosy-cheeked.
“Dowden, your two boys tied at the top
of the exam.”
He drew his head out of its stall, taking
the curve out of his back and turned toward
the door.
“Oh, oh! Did they? Did they?” he
said. “Very good of you. Thanks, thanks!
Very good of you indeed !”
Phillips, having done his good deed, turned
and disappeared among the linotypes. There
was quiet again; the routine went on.
He heard the head reader behind him, and
sat up.
“Henderson’s back. You can give over his
proofs. I’m very pleased to hear about your
boys.”
“Yes, yes. I will. Thanks very much.
Thank you, Mr. Fysch. They have done
well. Very well. Very smart boys.”
“Mine cashed in on Gallipoli,” the head
reader said.
He looked up with feigned surprise. He
had heard this before. “Oh, oh,” he said,
“I’m sorry to hear that. Very sorry. Very
sorry indeed. Very”
But the head reader had turned and was
going clumsily back to his desk.
Dowden’s offsider began calling over the
fruit-market report. He was free again to
think. Of course it was true. They were
together every night that he was sitting
there. He knew it, and so did these others.
But his chance would come. Some night some-
think would happen, and then he would
catch them.
The clock above the head reader’s desk
began to strike eleven. Those who were not
reading at the moment got up from their
desks and stretched themselves. The head
reader came once more to where Dowden
sat.
“I thought, Dowden,” he said, “perhaps
you’d like to get away early to-night on
account of the boys.”
For a second he hesitated. The boys,
of course, were having a week in the moun-
tains, but
“I would. Yes, yes. I would. I would.
I certainly Avould, Mr. Fysch.”
“They were fine lads, too,” he heard Fysch
saying. “One was in the infantry and one
in the signallers.”
Dowden, who had heard all that before,
said in a loud voice: “It’s very good, very-
good of you, to let me off, Mr. Fysch. I
would like to see the boys; would like to
see them very much.”
“I know how you feel,” the older man
said. He handed Dowden a pull of the
scholarship exam., putting a black, ink-
greasy finger on the two names bracketed
at the top and smudging them.
Dowden went out as the others gathered
for their eleven o’clock coffee and tea at the
round table in the centre of the room. Each
went to the exact place he had gone to all
the years he had been there, so that Dow-
den’s place showed strangely empty. At
one time and another each of these had
been away for a night or more sick; he had
never missed a night in five years.
“Clever pair of boys of Dowden’s,” the
excitable little reader from the fifth desk
said suddenly, voicing the general thought.
“Yes ; you’d think he’d look more cheerful
about things,” the tall, fleshless man opposite
him said.
“He has a fine wife, too ; a bit younger
than himself,” the little man added.
“A very nice woman, indeed,” the head
reader said, with the importance of a
privileged person. “They’re a very nice
family. A hard-Avorking man, a decent wife,
two fine boys”
He stopped abruptly and looked out of the
door into the composing-room. The others
went on preparing their supper snacks and
said nothing. They all knew what was
coming; they had all heard it before.
One of his own boys had been in the
infantry and one in the signallers, and they
were buried on Gallipoli.
As he was saying it Dowden came in through
the door He had not been gone five minutes
—not time to get out of the building.
“Funny, funny, he said, going up to his
place at the table. “Funny I never thought
of it before. There won’t be anyone home.
No one. Everyone’s away. Funny. Very
funny, indeed.”
He still carried the pull of the examina-
tion report, and he put it on the table beside
him and began to undo his small parcel of
sandwiches. Everybody was busy munching,
and he fell to upon his own supper.
Of course, he told himself, he had done
the right thing in coming back. The boys!
Smart lads! It would have been a horrible
disgrace to them if he had gone on and
' He looked down at their two names; they
seemed very smudged and blurred.

There’s no gloom in the home
where Hypol is used. Children
nourished with this famous
energy food develop affability,
alertness of mind and body,
vigor, happiness.
Hypol also provides a valuable
treatment in tubercolosis, and
is a proved safeguard against
that widespread and most
damaging disease—Rickets.
The beauty of Hypol is its
delicious appetising flavour. It
