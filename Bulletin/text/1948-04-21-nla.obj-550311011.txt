COMPTON WYNYATES, ONE OF THE STATELY HOMES OF ENGLAND
/~vNE of Britain’s great houses is Compton Wynyates, the country
seat of the Marquess of Northampton and one of the finest
examples of Tudor domestic architecture in England. It stands in
a cup-shaped valley, encircled by trees ; its wide lawns and beauti-
ful 18th century topiary gardens, now one of the show gardens of
England, was once the bed of a moat, and the marks of the chains
of the drawbridge on the house can still be seen.
William Compton, who died in 1529, was the builder of
Compton Wynyates, where Henry VIII stayed on several occasions.
In 1572 Queen Elizabeth spent a few days in the house. In 1726
Lord Compton, afterwards Fifth Earl of Northampton, cut back
the old roof and raised the walls into a battlemented parapet.
The Second Earl of Northampton was a favourite of Charles
I, and, with his sons, took a prominent part in the Civil Wars. In
1644 Compton Wynyates was besieged, captured and pillaged by
the Parliamentary troops ; Lord Northampton eventually recovered
his estates on payment of £20,000.
The interior of the house, notable for its eighty rooms and its
secret staircase and hiding places, contains a fine panelled Great
Hall with a timber roof; a chapel with a Tudor carved oak screen
and a Council Chamber in the great tower.

NEW SINCLAIR LEWIS .
Sinclair Lewis should know better. It
is all very well, and highly creditable,
no doubt, to have opinions about the
wrongs of American negroes, but when
the expression of those opinions in a
novel leads to the distortion and falsifi-
cation of character, to sentimentality and
cheap evasions, it is time for the author
to take long thoughts.
The central character of ’Kingsblood
Royal (Australasian Publishing Co.) is a
young, red-headed bank clerk named Neil
Kingsblood. Neil’s father has a fantastic
theory that the family are the rightful
heirs to the throne of England; Neil,
amusedly exploring the archives of the
clan, discovers that a remote ancestor was
a full-blooded negro.
Whereupon this red-haired bank clerk,
who has been shown with his wife and
daughter as the Happy Young American
Married Couple, destroys himself, his
wife, his daughter, his father, his mother,
his brother, his sisters and all his rela-
tives; not by the merciful method of
running amuck with an axe, but by pub-
licly confessing that he is a “negro” so
that the family is not merely socially
ostracised, but blasted and blighted. His
father, in fact, dies.
It should be understood that this con-
fession is perfectly gratuitous ; nobody
except Neil knows the story of his
ancestry and nobody, unless he tells it, is
likely to. And it should be further
understood that, in the northern State
where the novel is set, Neil is not legally
a negro and it is only because of his own
insistence that he comes to be regarded
as one. Strongly as Sinclair Lewis de-
scribes the racial bitterness in his town,
the reader must have a lingering doubt
as to whether, if Neil did not insist on a
political martyrdom, his friends and
associates would be at all seriously per-
turbed,about his one-thirty-second propor-
tion of negro blood. They might simply
tell him not to be a fool. But Neil does
insist on martyrdom; and on making
martyrs of his family as well.
Of this allegedly happy and well-
balanced young man, who leaps at the
chance to destroy himself, Sinclair Lewis
makes two entirely contradictory char-
acters. One, set down clearly and faith-
fully in dialogue, because Lewis is a
genuine novelist and cannot help observ-
ing character accurately when he really
has his eye on it, is the true Neil Kings-
blood, an irresolute idiot, capable of being
developed into a fool as - grotesque, as
tragic and as sublime as Conrad’s Razu-
mov. This is the Neil Kingsblood who,
for no reason at all except that un-
consciously he desires destruction, cannot
help blurting out his secret to every negro
he comes across. Neil is talking to a
negro nurse, Sophie, to whom he is
attracted;
Sophie said, rather wearily, “He’s a
colored fellow named Vanderbilt Litch—a
usurer —the only suspected colored Quisling
in town. But you wouldn’t be interested.”
“Why wouldn’t I?”
“How could you take any interest in the
fussing of us local busybodies? Our sign
is ‘For colored only,’ and that lets you
out, Captain.”
—Don’t say it! Don’t tell her you’re
colored! Shut up! Don’t say anything!
You’ve already told Ash and the Woolcapes
—too many. Wait now, wait!
And with that he ‘ babbled, “That lets
me in, Sophie, because I’ve discovered,
here recently, that I’m part colored.”
The novelist in him having discovered,
as he sees and says again when Neil’s
family are raging at, him for destroying
them, that his hero is a “babbler,” a
weakling and a fool, Sinclair Lewis turns
propagandist and portrays the second,
contradictory Neil Kingsblood ; a strong,
noble soul who finds his destiny in cham-
pioning the negro cause. It is remotely
possible, theoretically, to credit this sort
of psychological somersault, as a kind
of religious conversion caused by pro-
found shock. To accept the novel on
that understanding, to accept the blank
Neil of the opening chapters and the
“babbling” Neil of the confessions as a
kind of Tolstoi, one would have to read
into it a depth and passion that are no-
where manifested.
But there are too many falsities in
the portrayal of this second Neil for one
to feel that Sinclair Lewis is sincerely
presenting a psychological study of the
phenomenon of religious conversion.
Everywhere there is evasion, everywhere
there is too obvious an attempt to en-
noble the hero.
The fact that Neil has caused his
father’s death is, for instance, clearly
shown by the development of the story,
yet Neil is then exonerated by the author,
and doctors who regard him as morally
a patricide are sternly reproved: Neil
must be kept noble. The destruction of
Neil’s family is never fully dramatised:
Neil must be kept noble. Fantastically,
when he meets among the negroes a
former slatternly servant, Neil accepts
her excuse that she was so busy clean-
ing the rest of his house that she was
forced to leave her own room filthy and
untidy: Neil and his slatternly servant
must both be kept noble. Again, Neil is
strongly attracted to the negro nurse
Sophie, who has once been a night-club
dancer, but they do not yield to passion;
both must be kept noble.
And so the falsification goes on until,
in the last chapter, the drama that could
have been made of the first, the destruc-
tive and foolish Neil, peters out in
feebleness. Earlier, Neil has associated
with Communist negroes who talk
“merrily” about machine-guns ; but when
a white mob is attacking his house at
the end, and other negroes come armed
with guns to help him in his defence, the
Communists are conspicuously absent —
not because Sinclair Lewis wished to
show them as cowards, but because Com-
munists are not nice company in con-
temporary America, and Neil must be
kept noble. Though Neil is ..armed and
ready to shoot, someone in the crowd
fires first: so Neil, when he shoots, is
kept noble. \And, though he wounds
several people in the dark, he kills no
one; killing is not nice, and Neil must
be kept noble.
Whether Neil is fool or saint, the
movement of the novel obviously de-
mands a tragic ending. But if Neil and
his wife are shot defending their house,
the novel might fail to convey, to shallow-
minded political readers, what is called
“a note of hope for the future”: so the
wife is wounded decorously in the arm
and she and an unscathed Neil are
carried off in the police-wagon—with,
it is understood, a perfect defence (no
Communists; the crowd fired first; no-
body killed) for the subsequent court
proceedings. So all ends nobly, tamely,
and evasively.
Sinclair Lewis is, of bourse, always
Sinclair Lewis: at least in flashes. There
are vivid and dramatic scenes in this
book, notably the picture of the enraged
family when Neil Kingsblood tells them
they have negro blood. There are acid
and amusing sketches of Lewis’s favorite
Babbitts, there is charm in the women
characters, there are some excellent
anonymous letters and, though less fre- ■
quently than in Babbitt or Gideon Planish,
there are some of those crowded para-
graphs of \yhich Sinclair Lewis is a
master: —-
They did not notice them, but on the
way to the Pineland they must have passed
the scroll-work palaces of 1880, an Italian
Catholic church, a pawnshop in which a
Lithuanian lumberjack had recently pawned
the Luger pistol with which he had mur-
dered a Siamese mining-camp cook, the
best women’s dress-shop between Fort Wil-
liam and Dallas, a Victoria Cross aviator
and a Negro clergyman who was a Doctor
of Philosophy.
But to offset its central falsity the novel
would need characterisation and humor
on the Dickensian Scale, and Lewis is
not in that class, Kingsblood Royal is
only temporarily and accidentally valu-
able as a novel, only superficially enter-
taining. Sinclair Lewis has always been
at his best in satire, and here he refuses
to satirise his hero or his negroes.
The book is chiefly interesting as a
piece of propaganda, a work of journal-
ism rather than art; and as such, to
anyone unfamiliar with the problems and
the potentialities of the American negro,
it is very lively reading.
As is almost inevitable in a work of
propaganda—would the hotel clerk on
page 195, for instance, really have ex-
cluded negroes from the category of
“decent” people?—Lewis obviously over-
states his case from time to time.
Dealing with the “jollity” with which
Communist negroes discuss insults to
their race and the use of machine-guns as
a retort, the novelist does not seem to
have considered the fact that there are
many kinds of laughter, and that those
kinds which arise from bitterness, from
the lust for blood or from the fraternity
of quasi-religious fanatics should not be
confused with Falstaff’s. The book cer-
tainly gives the impression, in spite of
specific denials and the presence of good
and bad characters among both black and
white, that all negroes are good and in-
telligent men, all white men bad and
stupid.
But, by and large, the propa-
ganda is convincing and, in America,
may serve a useful purpose as an attack
on the ignorance and the prejudice and
the social injustices to which the negroes
are subjected.
Or, of course, it may not. One of the
characters is allowed to say, uncontra-
dieted, “God, these whites will never
know the patience the colored peoples
have shown, all over the world. It’s like
the patience of God himself.” And it is
difficult for an admirer of that white
civilisation of which Sinclair Lewis is a
product and an ornament to regard as
wholly benevolent a book which, by such
statements, could conceivably encourage
colored peoples “all over the world” to
proceed to such exhibitions of “God-like
patience” as we have seen in the late war
in the Pacific.
It is equally difficult for an admirer
of Sinclair Lewis as a novelist to applaud
his squandering his talent in propaganda ;
in a book which everybody will want to
read once for its political interest and its
moments of amusement or merit, and
which nobody will ever read twice.
Three Anthologies.
Among three recent anthologies the
most interesting from a literary view-
point is Edward Sackville-West’s And So
to Bed (Phoenix), a selection from the
8.8.C.’s late-night readings of poetry and
prose.
Merely roving comfortably through
English poetry and nature-writing since
the Elizabethans, making a vague narra-
tive pattern for his book as a whole by
letting one subject lead on to another
and by arranging them into a sequence
of winter, spring, summer and autumn,
Sackville-West might seem to have more
familiar material to offer than has Pro-
fessor E. D. Edwards in Bamboo, Lotus
and Palm —an anthology of the Far East,
South-East Asia and the Pacific —or than
Kathleen Freeman in The Greek Way
(both published by MacDonald). But
it is a pleasure, if not an enterprising one,
to come across old favorites from Keats
and Shelley and Wordsworth and Yeats
in And So to Bed and, both in his re-
searches among the minor poets of the
past and among newcomers of today,
Sackville-West has his-measure of enter-
prise.
Most of his new writers seem to be
under the influence of Dylan Thomas.
We find Terence Tiller writing, in a
mannered but by no means ineffective
elegaic poem of wartime:
I heard them singing in the shadow of sand
how years grow brittle as bread between our
fingers,
and the immeasurable miles our garland.
They spoke to the lute with their five-tongued
hands,
and I believed the singers.
And W. R. Rodgers, straining altogether
too oddly after odd effects, describing an
unfortunate swan in the terms:
To where the roofed swan suavely swings
Without qualm on the footling wave
That laves it on, with elbowing wings swelled
Wide under its eyes’ held look and architrave.
Sackville-West is happier, on the whole,
in his selections from the minor poets
of the past, where time has sifted the
true oddity from the imitation. George
Peele, who influenced Sacheverell Sitwell,
is worth meeting:
Fair maiden, white and red,
Comb me smooth, and stroke my head ;
And thou shaft have some cockle bread.
Gently dip, but not too deep,
For fear thou make the golden beard to weep.
Fair maid, white and red,
Comb me smooth, and stroke my head;
And every hair a sheave shall be,
And every sheave a golden tree.
And so is Samuel Daniel, who says he
has built his mind so high and so firm
that; —'
The storms of sad confusion, that may grow
Up in the present for the coming times,
Appal not him, that hath no side at all,
But of himself, and knows the worst can fall.
Although his heart, so near allied to earth,
Cannot but pity the perplexed state
Of troublous and distressed mortality,
That thus make way into the ugly birth
Of their own sorrows, and do still beget
Affliction upon imbecility:
Yet seeing thus the course of things must run,
He looks thereon not strange, but as foredone.
There are, of course, no Australian
poems in And So to Bed ,■ which sug-
gests that the 8.8. C. should do some cor-
responding with the A.B.C. A link with
this country is the publication in the
anthology of one or two of Jack Lind-
say’s translations from the Greek.
Professor Edwards, though she does
not deal directly in Bamboo. Lotus and
Palm with Australia nor, except for a
quotation from G. Pratt’s Some Folk
Songs and Myths of Samoa, draw on
authors who might be claimed as Aus-
tralian, has, naturally, a good deal of
material of considerable interest to any
country bordering on the Pacific. There
are folklore and,, travel notes from New
Guinea, and extracts from the narratives
of many Pacific voyagers, including
Drake and Jukes of the Fly. Though
writers of Herman Melville’s calibre are
drawn on, the book is informative rather
than literary in its intention. Japanese
writers and artists are included, as well
as travel writings from that country:
a feat of academic detachment which the
present reader finds it possible to approve
but difficult to enjoy.
Dr. Freeman of The Greek Way is,
like Professor Edwards, a lady ; and a
learned one. She does not have to use
Jack Lindsay’s translations, but has made
her own throughout. Her anthology is
a kind of “Greek week-end book,” and
is intended to show that Greek literature
was not “heavy and dull” but “singu-
larly full of wit, humor and charm.” It
fulfils that admirable purpose, and is
crammed with interesting material, but
consists too much of snippets.
It is one thing to present Greek epi-
grams and proverbs to prove that the
Greeks were a merry lot, but it is doubt-
ful if to break Homer up into single
lines to demonstrate that he described the
wild boar or that Agamemnon could
swear prettily will really help anyone to
understand “the Greek way,” insofar as
it is represented by the majesty of the
Iliad. And whether or not it is of in-
terest to learn, in a brief paragraph from
the Medea, that Euripides described the
playing of draughts, anyone wishing to
understand the Greeks would surely do
better to risk the possible “heaviness and
dulness” of the whole of that murderous
and lively drama.
Bushrangers and Journalists.
The Cherokee Strip, by Marquis James
(Phoenix), is the autobiography of an
American writer who has twice won the
Pulitzer Prize for biography. James’s
boyhood, with which he is chiefly con-
cerned, was so colorful that he doesn’t
seem to have been born into life but into
a boys’ book by Edward S. Ellis; to
which has been added a chapter or two
of adult reading (more or less) from a
novel by Zane Grey.
The fictional flavor is enhanced by the
fact that the author’s boyhood hero was
a Mr. Howell, who claimed to have
fought and scalped most of the Indians
in North America and to have fought
and skinned most of the grizzly bears
(“b’ars” to Mr. Howell), and who, claim-
ing also to be a builder, erected
James’s two-story family home without
a stairway so that they had to climb up
a ladder from the outside to the upper
rooms.
An even more desirable acquaintance
was the celebrated Dick Yeager. Dick
would have made a good Australian; he
stuck-up stores and coaches, and when
his hide-out was surrdhnded he disguised
himself as an old man, and, playing a
mouth-organ and riding in a decrepit
spring-wagon drawn by a 17-year-old
horse, passed through a line of vigilances
whose guilelessness would have done
credit to Sir Frederick Pottinger.
To the regret of all, Dick did not live
to be hanged, but died in jail of gunshot
wounds. Before he departed to his im-
mortality the young James, accompanied
by his mother, was permitted to visit the
outlaw in prison, where he found Mm
unrepentant and much impressed with his
own impressiveness:
“Dick Yeager, I hope you are comfort-
able,” said Mama after Ad had said who
we were. Mama stood by the door of the
cell.
“I am; tol’ably so; thank you, ma’am,”
said Dick Yeager. Dick held out his hand.
I marched to the bunk and took it. Mama
stayed where she was. “Young man,” said
Dick Yeager, “you can tell ’em you’ve shook
hands with the bigges’ outlaw Oklahoma
ever had.”
From bushrangers one passes, by an
easy association of ideas, to journalists.
As a youth Marquis James worked on
the sort of country newspaper where the
editor informs him; “ ‘H. H. Edmond-
son drove in from his fine farm in Pat-
terson Township on Saturday with a
load of early vegetables. He says Black
Bear Creek is low for this time of year
and they could stand a rain out there.’
Markey, that’s the perfect personal.”
James’s most nearly perfect personal in
newspaper chapters of The Cherokee
Strip is the portrait of a foreman printer
who had the habit of talking aloud to
himself. Since the foreman “led a life
of monastic rectitude,” his musings were
not as scandalous as could be hoped, but
he made* entertaining comments on fel-
low-employees and was charmingly
anxious about the intentions of the
young man who was keeping company
with the proprietor’s sister.
Thus it will be seen that, despite Mr.
Howell’s Injuns and b’ars. The Chehokee
Strip travels comfortably into Australian
reading. Though what “a few oinking
shoats in the bed on their way to market”
might be passes human understanding.
Marquis James says he wrote The
Cherokee Strip because his small daughter
said to him: “Pop, why don’t you write
some of the things you tell about in-
stead of what you do write?” and that
possibly explains why it is not quite so
readable as, with its rich material, it
should be: authors should beware of
their small daughters. James has written
his book in a sort of rapid and monoton-
ous mumble, with an affectation of
modesty and offhandedness about his
humor, as if he were telling a marvellous
bedtime story and was so sure of appre-
ciation that he had no need to dramatise
himself. And it is a good bedtime story,
but a little soporific.

He’s brother to save,
On the banks of the Yarra
Lay a swimmer brave.

From the glare of the sun
Mourned the nude youth
For the ill fated one.

In he’s sad distress,
And by a friend was
Assisted to dress.

The long years gone
Upon the banks of the Yarra,
On a Sunday morn.


UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
Tojo.
In an editorial on the Japanese
war-crimes trials N. Y. “Times”
draws an interesting contrast be-
tween Goring and Tojo. The
German, it points out, “deliber-
ately repudiated all the laws and
concepts of Western civilisa-
tion” to which his fellow-
countrymen had subscribed.
Tojo, on the other hand, “could
adduce in self-justification the
most fundamental national,
political and religious concepts
that have governed Japan for
centuries.”
Very little has been published
in Australian cable columns
about the Jap trials, though
they would seem to have a
special interest for this country,
as a further comment indicates:
“One of the most significant
and even alarming developments
of the [Tojo] trial is the fact,
suppressed by Allied censorship,
that a huge majority of the
Japanese people still accept his
views.”
One of those views, rooted in
Jap tradition “prevalent
throughout the world until re-
cently and never abandoned in
Japan”—is that making wars “is
one of the fundamental rights of
a sovereign nation.” For all the
supposed democratising and
civilising of Japan, that notion,
N. Y. “Times” implies, is still
general Jap doctrine.
As well there is the Shinto re-
ligion, supposed to have been
purged and changed—as if such
a national religion could be
wiped out overnight by edict —
“a religion of conquest pro-
claiming that the Japanese are
a race of gods entitled to rule
the world, and that their Em-
peror is the chief god and Em-
peror of the world.”
So far from Shinto having
been broken, as was once con-
fidently claimed, the New York
paper reports a resurgence of
it, “proof that the Emperor’s re-
nunciation of his ‘godhood’ and
the disestablishment of the
Shinto shrined” have not changed
the people’s faith. Holding such
beliefs, with the additional con-
sequent belief which places abso-
lute loyalty to the Emperor
above all personal honor or
morality, Tojo said in his trial
that he was conscious,, of no
wrong, that what he had done
wasi “right and true,” and that
his only regret was that he had
lost the war.
Unless, as N. Y. “Times”
suggests, censorship suppresses
information on a general resurg-
ence of such Jap feeling, Aus-
tralia could profitably hear more
about it.
Unstable U.S. Policy.
Everyone trying to make sense
out of the current world muddle
must have often been puzzled
by the recent shifts, and make-
shifts, of U.S. policy.
The trouble, according to
Hanson W. Baldwin in a “Satur-
day Evening Post” article, is’ the
American “unstable political
mind,” the gyrations of which
in the debates on the Marshall
Plan and other matters have
been “scaring the daylights” out
of America’s friends in Europe
and Asia. “The plain truth is
these friends don’t know whether
they can depend upon America.”
Excusing some of the recent
sharp reversings, N. Y. “World-
Telegram” attacks the assump-
tion “that in international affairs
there is always' a clear, easy
choice between right and wrong,
black and white ; that there is
always a permanent solution;
that a Government should have
a rigid policy and stick' to it
regardless of changing circum-
stances.” It holds that view to
be “naive to the point of ab-
surdity,” and, referring to the
Palestine and Trieste shifts of
U.S. policy, argues that “the
best and wisest policy” regard-
ing either problem “could be
the worst policy if it produced
a world war, particularly a war
for which we were not pre-
pared.”
“Saturday Evening Post” in
editorial comment takes a
less accommodating view of
the inconsistencies, with particu-
lar reference to the Palestine
shift; “Do we know where we
are going, and do we want to
go? Having tvyisted the arms
of our satellites in the United
Nations Assembly into produc-
ing this! impasse, we welshed in
the Security Council because,
when the chips are down, stra-
tegic considerations are bound
to prevail. Mr. Truman is now
suffering the penalties prescribed
for those who start things which
they cannot finish. As a great
Power we have plenty of the
fundamentals to learn and
practise.”
Addressing his fellow-Sena-
tors', former U.S. Admiral
Thomas C. Hart referred to
“one of the fundamentals in the
conduct of foreign relations”
having been overlooked: “That
fundamental is that the United
States should not lay out a
course and should not adopt a
line of foreign policy which may
lead to the clash of arms unless
we first answer two questions in
the affirmative. One of these
questions is the ready avail-
ability of our forces in case the
pursuit of such policy should,
unfortunately, lead to open con-
flict. The other question is:
Would we be entirely willing to
use that force if the policy we
adopt should be opposed to the
point of war? History is re-
plete with instances when that
fundamental in the conduct of
foreign policy has been forgot-
ten. We ourselves have figured
in some of these instances.”
“The whole international
situation today,” a “Wall-street
Journal” writer comments,
“speaks eloquently for closing
up American ranks for achiev-
ing the maximum of national
unity in framing a foreign policy
that will possess the important
element of continuity.” The
writer touches on one aspect that
has been most obvious all
through in the Palestine issue ;
pointing to the need, now that
the world “challenge is so
serious,” to prevent “the fram-
ing and execution of foreign
policy from becoming a football
of partisan politics.”
A peculiarity of the American
government system explains a
good deal of the inconsistency:
“The need for placing foreign
policy on a bipartisan or non-
partisan basis is all the more
pressing because the American
Constitution and the normal
functioning of American politics
make for frequent division of
authority between the executive
and legislative branches of the
Government. The present situ-
ation, when the Presidency, the
executive arm, is in the hands of
one party while the other con-
trols both Houses of Congress
would be impossible in countries
where the party, or a group of
parties, with a Parliamentary
majority automatically takes
over the Administration.”
Purely political appointments
(an abuse of office which
America certainly doesn’t have
on its own) are pointed to as
further contributing to the
general instability of policy:
“The easygoing days when it
was possible without injury to
the national interest to treat ap-
pointments of this kind as a con-
venient means of paying-off
political debts are no longer
with us.”
The purely political element
is at its strongest in a year when
the Presidential sweepstakes is
being run. The “Wall-street
Journal” writer concludes; “It
would be an immense asset in
the American struggle to pre-
serve peace, freedom and order
in a troubled world if both our
adversaries and our friends
could count on the two elements
of continuity and consistency in
American foreign policy.”
N. Y. “Times” correspondent
in Washington, James B. Res-
ton, sees' as one cause of the
recent inconsistencies a very
much overworked State Depart-
ment, and makes the surprise
statement that Secretary Mar-
shall has long been seeking re-
tirement.
“Such are the terrible com-
pulsions of world events,” writes
Reston, “and such is the de-
pendence of the world on United
States leadership that Secretary
Marshall has been forced into
the role of fireman, rushing here
and there to deal with emergen-
cies, instead of being able to
stay at the centre and give co-
herence to the whole.” A result
is continuous conflict of opinion
within the State Department it-
self on such matters as the
Palestine partition and the Mar-
shall Plan ; and “All this adds
up to a growing feeling in Wash-
ington that policies of the
greatest importance are being
improvised; that, under the
pressure of day-to-day events,
ad hoc decisions are being
taken that seem right at the time,
but sometimes bear little rela-
tion to a central pattern or to
one another.”
Quite apart from a depart-
ment inadequately staffed for
the job, and also the general in-
experience in the very difficult
field of foreign affairs, the ques-
tion crops up whether “the
United States, under its Consti-
tution and with its traditions,
can develop a consistent foreign
policy on so many different
fronts.” Domestic politics keep
intruding to force makeshift de-
cisions, those on Palestine pro-
viding a tragic example.
Another factor not very con-
ducive to the holding of a con-
sistent policy-line is “the tradi-
tional hostility between Con-
gress and the State Department,”
which has “greatly hampered
Mr. Marshall’s efforts to fit his
various plans into a central
formula.”
Yet another element in the ap-
parent instability of American
policy is that world events can
move too fast for a U.S. system
geared for slow motion: “The
Congress by habit works on one
thing at a time —on a Marshall
Plan, then a China programme,
then a Greek-Turkish pro-
gramme. As things are now,
however, both the Cortgress and
Secretary Marshall find them-
selves trying to catch up with
events.”
They have been learning by
hard experience regarding
Palestine, Trieste, Germany and
elsewhere—that expediency is no
substitute for solid principles.
Jew on Partition.
Lessing J. Rosenwald, presi-
dent of the American Council
for Judaism, begins an article in
“Collier’s”:
“Nine out of ten persons have
no idea what the recent United
Nations decision to partition
Palestine is all about. Further-
more, my guess is that nine out
of ten Jews, the people whose
whole lives will be affected by
that decision, are equally in the
dark as to its significance.”
Perhaps he could have safely
thrown in nine out of ten of the
U.N.O. Solomons who did the
partition botch-work.
Rosenwald speaks for the very
considerable amount of thought-
ful Jewish opinion that has been
doubtful all along about parti-
tion as a solution of anything.
“When the United Nations
voted to set up two States in
Palestine, a Zionist State and an
Arab State,” he writes, “many
thought its ostensible purpose
was to solve the age-old prob-
lem of the Jews. They also felt
that it was intended to help re-
lieve the plight of the 250,000
Jewish displaced persons in
Europe.
“I hope this partition plan
works out, but I firmly be-
lieve it will never solve the prob-
lem of the 11,000,000 Jews liv-
ing in all parts of the world. On
the contrary, I feel it will com-
plicate their problem enor-
mously. Furthermore, partition
may have created what will be
in effect another self-imposed
ghetto, the last thing the Jews
themselves want,
“Here is the question every
Jew, then, will have to ask him-
self; ‘Am I a member of a uni-
versal religion, Judaism, or am
I an adherent of Zionist
nationalism, with some degree of
attachment to a new State?’
“If one chooses to be con-
sidered a Jew by religion he will
thus affirm his loyalty to what-
ever country he lives in as a citi-
zen and where he can practise
his religion freely. But if he
decides on Zionist nationalism
he is either a citizen of Palestine
(which no one could criticise)
or he is a citizen of some other
country with anticipated rights
in Palestine and hence certain
obligations to that country.
“Most Jews would not take
the latter course, Zionism, The
majority of the 10,000,000 Jews
living outside of Palestine want
to stay in the lands where they
and their ancestors have lived
for centuries, have raised fami-
lies and established homes.”
One of the many pretences in
the Palestine partition tragedy
has been the completely false
idea that all Jewish opinion was
in favor.
A Bridges’ Sequel.
U.S. deportation proceedings
against ex - Australian Harry
Bridges might possibly be re-
opened. That proposal has been
made by leading Republican
Presidential aspirant Stassen,
with the rider that if Bridges is
proved to be a Communist he
should be deported—that is, sent
back here.
When previously up for inves-
tigation Bridges was cleared of
being a Communist by the U.S.
Supreme Court. In February
his divorced wife told the Con-
gress Committee on un-Ameri-
can activities that Bridges had
threatened her life if she exposed
him as a member of the Com-
munist party. She declared that
she had handled his membership
card, and that his party name
was “Harry Dorgan,”
Speaking at Seattle, Stassen
urged that known Communist in-
filtration tactics in the U.S.
should be “vigorously investi-
gated and exposed.” Recent dis-
closures, he declared, “clearly
indicate that the case of Mr.
Harry Bridges should be re-
opened, thoroughly reinvesti-
gated, and if his active member-
ship of the Communist party is
proved he should be removed
from labor leadership and de-
ported/]
India’s Princes.
Instead of being abolished,
which many expected would be
a result of Indian independence,
the Princes are taking on a new
lease of life. Their States and
estates —altogether about 900
of them, with a population of
more than 20,000,000 are
smoothly being integrated into
a United States of Rajasthan
and woven into the Dominion
of India.
And, reports the London
“Times” Delhi correspondent,
Secretary of the States Ministry
V. P. Menon has declared that
not only is there no intention of
“exterminating” the Princes but
even where one of them should
die childless the title would not
be allowed to lapse.
In that event a relative or
citizen of the State or Dominion
distinguished in public service
would be “raised to the peerage.”
The correspondent comments:
“The implications of this de-
cision are far-reaching, as it may
create a social structure the anti-
thesis of the republic visualised
by political thinkers' [in India].”
Before independence the
Indian Congress ordered its
members to relinquish British
titles, but that is apparently being
quietly forgotten. “India,” the
“Times” man declares, “has a
strong aristocratic sense, and
Indians of all classes, except the
Communists and those whose
spirits have not lost the sourness
which years of political frustra-
tion have engendered, find it
both easy and natural to accept
the trappings of greatness.”
Floating Air-bases.
One of the main factors held
to be acting as a potent deterrent
against Soviet aggression being
carried into actual war is the
very great strength of the U.S.
Navy (to say nothing of the
British) and the considerable
force of it that has been estab-
lished in the Mediterranean,
The special deterrent counted on
is its carrier force.
On that. Admiral Nimitz
made some significant points in
a report obviously intended
chiefly for Kremlin consump-
tion. “Naval forces,” he said,
“are able without resorting to
diplomatic channels to establish
off-shore anywhere in the world
airfields completely equipped
with machine-shops, ammuni-
tion dumps, tank-farms, ware-
houses, together with quarters
and all types of accommodations
for personnel. Such task forces
are virtually as complete as any
air-base ever established.
“They constitute the only air-
bases that can be made avail-
able near enemy territory with-
out assault and conquest, and
furthermore, they are mobile
offensive bases that can be em-
ployed with the unique attributes
of secrecy and surprise—which
contribute equally to their de-
fensive as well as offensive
effectiveness.
“It is improbable that bomber
fleets will be capable, for several
years to come, of making two-
way trips' between continents,
even over the polar route, with
heavy loads of bombs. It is
apparent, then, that in the event
of war within this period, if we
are to project our power against
the vital areas of any enemy
across the ocean before beach-
heads on enemy territory are
captured, it must be by air-sea
power: by aircraft launched by
carriers; and by heavy surface
ships and submarines projecting
guided missiles and rockets.”
Dragnet Digest.
“War Not Inevitable.” —As cabled,
President Truman does not assume
that war is “either imminent or in-
evitable.” It recalls that nothing was
heard so frequently from high authori-
ties just before the last war broke
out than statements that war was
not inevitable. However, despite the
recurrent alarms, David Lawrence
reports in N. Y. “Sun” that “curi-
ously enough, the expectation [in
Washington] is that Russia will
moderate her policy and will not risk
war.” Those taking this optimistic
view hold that Russia “does not dare
mobilise for war because she is
economically weak”; that “Russia,
moreover, would bring on serious in-
ternal trouble if she began a mobili-
sation.”
* ♦ * *
Cyprus Base. —Britain has officially
stated that “large numbers” of the
70,000-odd British troops that have
been doing, in Palestine, the world’s
most thankless job are going to
Cyprus. The reason, a Colonial Office
spokesman said, is that “a base is
necessary in the eastern Mediterra-
nean.” Within a radius of 720 miles
of Cyprus lie the Suez Canal, Athens,
Bucharest, the Dardanelles and the
southernmost part of the Soviet
Union.

Socialists Flop.— r-One of the most
persistent arguments for Socialism in
•Britain and elsewhere has been that
it provides the most effective barrier
against Communism. Events have
been proving it so much eyewash.
As “Wall-street Journal” sees it:
“Socialists like Cyrankiewicz in
Poland, Fierlinger in Czechoslovakia,
Szakasits in Hungary, Nenni in Italy,
are more valuable to Moscow than
many Communists. For these men
are serving the Communist cause un-
conditionally and at the same time
retain prestige and authority in the
eyes of some groups which would not
so readily follow avowed Communists.
There have been individual heroes and
martyrs among the East European
Socialists. But by and large it must
be recognised that they have not put
up much of a fight.”

Scepticism on Truman. —Comment-
ing in N. Y. “Sun” on scepticism
over U.S. foreign policy, shared even
by members of Mr. Truman’s own
Democratic party, with opponents
declaring that the current international
crises are largely Presidential-year
politics, David Lawrence gives an
odd bit of information on a Truman
veto: “When a President of the
United States makes an alliance with
a labor faction to get votes and
official Washington knows he didnt
write the veto message disapproving
the Taft-Hartley law, but took the
arguments which the C. 1.0. leaders
handed him, he loses the cqnfidence
of people who want to believe in
him.” Lawrence himself holds that
“in international affairs Mr. Truman
would pot stoop to political tactics.
Which seems to recall a place called
Palestine.

The Comrades Are Coming— N. Y.

Riesel gazes into the crystal and sees
the Kremlin boys marching on New

Those Russian roubles arent what

1915 AND 1948.
Once more the Day comes round; the
Day which united the Australian people
as nothing before it had done. Not
even Federal Union, which was carried
by sweeping majorities only in Vic-
toria, South Australia, Westralia and
Tasmania, after the consummation had
been delayed by an insufficient majority
on the draft Constitution, thereupon
altered, in N. S. Wales. At that the
Brisbane electorates, Rockhampton and the
Westralian farming districts voted against
Federation, and Sydney and suburbs were
almost equally divided. There followed
secession threats from time to time,
though they never came to anything.
At the thrilling news of the Landing
all political divisions ceased. Pride in the
achievement of the soldiers from Aus-
tralia, fighting on a storied coast along-
side their comrades from Britain, New
Zealand, India and Newfoundland, with
the great British ships, their carriers and
protectors, standing off-shore —pride of
kinship and loyalty was a universal senti-
ment. It was quickened by Sir lan
Hamilton’s glowing dispatches and by the
works of poets and prose-poets, all bear-
ing testimony to the physique and bear-
ing of the Anzacs. Throughout the
vicissitudes of that campaign in a “cruel
land” it never flagged. It survived the
Evacuation itself.
No one then doubted of final victory.
No one foresaw or could have foreseen
that the victory that came would not be
final; that three empires would fall and
whole dynasties disappear; that from the
wreck of one empire a more sinister
Oriental Power, with revolutionary agents
everywhere, would start up ; that Pales-
tine would become a British mandate, in
the end to be abandoned to, Jews turned
ferociously anti-British and to Arabs
grimly determined to regain it for them-
selves ; that Australia by the spring of
1916 would be divided into two camps.
That old Australia, the Australia that
went to war against the Central Powers,
was a good country. The spirit of
the people was high and patriotism was
in the ascendant. Though a drift to the
coastal cities was in progress, and had
been for years, the population was in
the main country-bred.
It was an age in which leadership was
looked for, rarely in vain. Not yet had
Labor “leaders” arisen to propagate and
practise the “philosophy” that men must
be “squared” to fight, “squared” with
“social security,” and that “the workers”
must be given everything they ask for,
and their union bosses permitted to do
whatever they choose to do, though trans-
port and industry be sabotaged and the
rule of law and even foreign policy go
down the drain,
A Labor Prime Minister, taking
office in the second week of the first
German war, said Australia was in that
war “to the last man and the last shil-
ling.” Thus addressed and fortified, the
country, with fewer than 5,000,000
people, consented to moving sacrifices:
60,000 dead and perhaps 40,000 perman-
ently maimed. But it came out of those
wars with a heightened reputation,
honored everywhere for the valor of its
sons on many battlefields, with its White
Australia doctrine accepted at Versailles,
and with German New Guinea, its value
to be demonstrated in the Jap war, added
to its territories.
Australia emerged from the Jap war and
the second German war with its military
renown preserved by the Young Diggers
and by the R.A.N. and the R.A.A.F.,
whose losses were severe, but without the
security it could fairly claim at the end
of 1918, and with many of its liberties
gone and others under threat.
The map of Asia and that of
Europe, under Communist pressure, and
the direction of policy in the English-
speaking world have been altered to Aus-
tralia’s disadvantage. Britain, weakened
by its heroic exertions, except morally, is
no longer supreme from Aden to Hong
Kong ; has given up Burma, India (though
the two parts of India stay as Dominions
for as long as they elect to stay) and
Egypt, and is under Chauvinist challenge
in Central and South America and the
Falklands. The Dutch remain in their
East Indies, but only at the price of
sharing the government with “our Inder-
nesian comrades,” proteges of Japs
during the war and of Moscow since,
with whom the Australian “Govern-
ment” sided, in craven surrender to
Communists and in base betrayal of its
own country’s interests. Abroad and at
home, the Australian “Government”
yields to Communists, whom it affects to
regard as disciples of a political “philo-
sophy,” not to be touched though
they blockade Queensland, make Bris-
bane the scene of rioting, in the retro-
spect startlingly resembling that which
desolated Bogota, and expose industrial
law to ridicule and contempt.
True the country exhibits a delusive
appearance of prosperity. The “Govern-
ment” boasts that .there is “full employ-
ment,” and with itself as a vast employer
of persons who produce nothing except
forms, files, regulations and the like, so
there is. But so there is also in
Britain, whose doctrinaire Government,
likewise intent on “nationalising” every-
thing in sight, has been reduced to impos-
ing a capital levy on investment income.
In its craze for extorting huge tax-revenues
which, though riotously extravagant, it is
unable to spend fully, our tribulation has
done everything but that. Taxation, a
bagatelle in 1914-18, has become a burden
in every man’s business and home; and
much of the proceeds goes to support
a multitude of new masters, banded in
boards, commissions, committees, world
without end. A fourth of the adult
working population is in Government and
“semi-Government” jobs, mostly engaged
in pushing people around. So Australia
is no longer the free country it was in
1915.
In the situation in which Australia finds
itself a return to the spirit of 1915 is
essential. National unity is, and always
will be, Australia’s greatest need. But
it cannot possibly be achieved by the
crowd in office at Canberra, a crowd
since 1917 set on dividing the nation and
now aiming at widening the gap,
with the same “objective” as the Com-
munists and cancered by hate, as they are
—reducing the great part of the nation
that repudiates its socialist “philosophy”
to serfdom. Other men, other measures
and other methods are required, and
they can’t arrive too soon.
The Communists Celebrate.
The debate on international affairs in the
House of Representatives last week was,
as Mr. Menzies said, unusually serviceable
as a demonstration of Parliamentary
opinion. Great riumbers of Australians
have wished to hear delivered some ex-
pression of their resentment against Soviet
Russia’s persistent sabotage of efforts to
restore peace in the world —a policy
closely related to the industrial turmoil
and distress engineered by Communists
in this land with the purpose of support-
ing the Soviet’s political ends.
That Communists, both in their
spiritual home behind the Iron Curtain
and abroad as barrackers for a Utopia
of which no first-hand inspection is per-
mitted to any outsider, have prevailed as
far as they have done in the democracies
they detest is to be explained by:
(1) The exaggeration of Russia’s co-
operation as an ally of the Western peoples
during the late war.'
(2) The assumption, even more inex-
cusable since the end of 1945, and still
maintained in some measure by British and
Australian Socialist Governments, that the
Soviet rulers have any notion whatever of
co-operating with them to restpre peace,
stability, and a free world of free peoples.
(3) The crediting of Communist Russia
with adherence to the Atlantic Charter,
whereas in reality, if the principles of that
instrument meant anything to Moscow, the
Bolshevik dictatorship’s first action in
acceptance of it would necessarily be to cut
its own throat.
The Moscow gang has for so long
been masquerading in a false character
that the popular mind of the West,
inured to judging by appearances, has
been slow to admit itself deceived. It
has been anaesthetised by propaganda—
one of the most insidious afflictions of
total war. What has startled the com-
mon peoples in countries beyond Russia’s
close-range influence is the realisation
that the Soviet Government, and its
dutiful “fifth-columns” in the Communist
parties in most democracies, seem willing
to risk even another world war in their
efforts to obstruct the American plan for
aiding European recovery. This is apt
setting for the Communists’ celebration
of the centenary of the Marxian Mani-
festo.
In a review oF the Communist record
since that revolutionary testament was
published, a writer in the London “Spec-
tator” draws attention to a fundamental
weakness in the Soviet dictatorship. The
Manifesto was issued in “that year of
illusions, 1848,” and passed at the time
almost unnoticed. Indeed, Marx joined
a flock of disappointed revolutionaries
who fled from the Continent for refuge
in London in the following year.
Not till 40 years after the Manifesto
did Marxist ideas begin to make any
headway—and that in Germany. There
the Social Democrats adopted the
Marxist prograrpme in 1891, but by 1914
the party had “divorced itself from the
revolutionary programme of a proletarian
seizure of power.” A leading German
socialist, Bernstein, had, at the close of
the century, mobilised an attack on
Marx’s whole system. “Development of
capitalism,” he held, “had followed quite
a different course from that predicted by
Marx”; the condition of the working-
classes was improving rather than de-
teriorating ; and the only logical thing
to do was to “abandon an out-of-date
programme of revolution discredited by
events.”
Even in Russia, when the 1917 revolu-
tion broke out, orthodox Marxists like
the Mensheviks, “and even the Bolsheviks
until Lenin’s arrival,” regarded the revo-
lution as a “bourgeois” one, and held “it
must first be consolidated and capitalism
given time to modernise and industrialise
the country before anyone could talk of
socialism.” Lenin, however, propounded
a new idea—“to jump the dialectical pro-
cess of history and, without waiting for
the intervening period of capitalist de-
velopment, to turn the bourgeois revo-
lution into the second, proletarian, revo-
lution overnight.” There was danger, for,
“from the point of view of Marxist ob-
jectives, Lenin was in a false position.”
To rescue himself and his supporters
from this he organised the Bolshevik
party as “a small compact body of pro-
fessional revolutionaries” as “the in-
strument of dictatorship to force events
and force the people to follow the pattern
he had set. For the last 30 years the
rulers of the Soviet Union have gone on
trying to close the gap by the same
methods.”
This is what the notorious Rosa Lux-
emburg, who lost her life for the revo-
lutionary cause in Germany, predicted
from prison in 1918 for the apostasy of
Moscow (wherefore she is no longer
officially extolled as among the martyrs):
Ihe suppression of all political life
throughout Russia must result in paralysing
the activity of the Soviets. Without uni-
versal suffrage, liberty of the press and
of public meeting, and freedom of debate,
public institutions will atrophy and take on
a shadow existence so that powers remain
with the bureaucracy alone. Nothing and
nobody is exempt from the action of this
law. Public life gradually ceases. A few
dozen party members control everything.
lt is, in. fact, government by a clique—a
dictatorship by a handful of politicians.
Criticism prophetic with a vengeance!
Having set up a dictatorship by violence,
and maintaining by force subjection of
the populations ensnared by it, these
revolution-mongers have prepared the
conditions for the ultimate revolt, of
dimensions bound to increase with every
extension beyond Russia’s borders of the
dictatorship’s temporary sway.
The chosen objective of the Soviet is
the establishment of a slave community
within a police-State. That is how it
has used power in Russia itself and how
it has treated one bordering European
State after another. The process has been
to foment disorder as a condition for
revolutionary action to this end, and in-
structions issued to Communist parties
abroad require conformity with this pat-
tern.
There are signs already that Com-
munism is, in fact, not doing well.
Even in Russia itself, where the “Iron
Curtain” cannot prevent the escape of
some information of the Stalin gang’s
difficulties, as illustrated by the rising
early this year in the Ukraine, *“Pravda’s”
condemnation of slackness in the factories,
and more recently the reports of aban-
donment of the flat-wage system as “a
bourgeois device” and the decreeing of
a piece-work remuneration with incentive
payments for higher production.
If Communism were succeeding there
would be no need for the Soviet to isolate
Russia and her satellite States (lately
Hitler’s) from the rest of the world, thus
Withholding the best possible Communist
advertisement.
The Ward-applauded destruction of the
Czech democracy, whose offence was,
while trusting to the accepted protection
and .patronage of Russia, that it tried to
make a bridge between Russia and the
West, opened all free men’s eyes (and par-
ticularly those in Finland) to what a
small State’s alliance with the Soviet
means. It showed western Germany
and western Austria what the Soviet
conceived as terms for agreement for a
restoration of unity in those countries.
It illustrates why the compromise provi-
sions for Trieste have fallen down, be-
cause no agreement can be made with
Moscow for even selection of a governor
of that city-State. It shows why U.N.O.
is becoming a jest for the cynical and
why the Security Council, by even Dr.
Evatt’s admission, is incurably impotent.
What happened in Bogota, Colombia,
the other day, could have happened in
Brisbane last month if the Communist
“blockade” of Queensland had beaten the
Queensland Government. The occasion
V 1
was the assembling of the Pan-American
conference to discuss the position of
South American republics in the Euro-
pean Recovery Programme and the ex-
tension of that programme to those re-
publics as both providers and receivers
under it. The President of Chile de-
scribed the rioting, accompanied by
wholesale looting, murder and destruc-
tion of the city, as “part of a Communist
master plan for similar outbreaks in Chile
and Bolivia, laid down by the Comin-
form at Belgrade last October'” and
General Marshall said:
International Communism inspired the
insurrection. It is of the same definite
pattern as occurrences which precipitated
strikes in France and Italy and are en-
deavoring to prejudice the elections in. Italy.
Every little country dragged into misery
behind the Iron Curtain is an illustration
that Communism will nowhere work with
Socialists or any other political party in
the government of a State, and confirms
the experience of the major Western
Powers that U.N.0., while the Soviet
remains in it, is a farce. With Russia as
at present governed there can be no co-
operation for peace settlements with any
of the late enemy States and no agree-
ment on disarmament or international
control of atomic weapons.
Instead, the Communist centenary is
being celebrated by Moscow, appropri-
ately enough, with every effort to fan
a new world war into flames.
Curtin Died Too Soon.
Though never a strong man—that was
a polite press fiction —John Curtin, Labor
Prime Minister, was sensitive on points
of honor, his own and his party’s, and he
would, had he lived, been seriously con-
cerned at the number of Court cases in
which Labor politicians have figured these
last two years!
And had the Keane dollar deal and
Goldberg’s account of the “business part-
nership” come out in his lifetime, John
Curtin could never have been reduced to
the desperate shifts to which Mr. Chifley
and Dr. Evatt were reduced when the
Opposition made a challenging issue of
the malodorous affair. He would have
got in first with an order for an inquiry,
that inquiry which the Chifley “Govern-
ment,” uneasily and evasively and with
recourse to'its miserable weapon the gag,
iniquitously refused. Nor would John
Curtin have let Mr. Ward carry on as a
Minister after Garden’s pal and patron
till the end of last year had been repre-
sented as a crook (denied) and a liar (no
opportunity for denial) by Garden’s
counsel, and after the evidence given by
others, still friends —the one who admitted
that Mr. Ward had got him a job as good
as his own and the one who confessed to
the swearing of a falsehood because he
“didn’t want to give evidence embarrassing
or injurious to the Minister.” John Curtin
would have asked Mr. Ward to return his
portfolio until his vindication had been
pronounced in Court and in Parliament.
John Curtin established the precedent
himself. Established it in June, 1943,
when Mr- Ward was his Minister of
Labor and National Service. Returning
to his Brisbane Line vomit in June, 1943,
Mr. Ward alleged, among other things,
that “one important report is missing
from the official files.” Told by the P.M.
and the Army Minister that this was un-
true, he “unreservedly accepted” their
statement and then repeated the slander.
Realising that it reflected seriously on
the Opposition, particularly Mr. Spender,
and on the Secretary of Defence, John
Curtin agreed to refer it to a Judge with a
royal commission, as one of four Wardian
charges. Then he said he had “adopted
the normal procedure of relieving the
Minister of administration until the re-
port of the royal commission is tabled.”
Tabled it was, after Mr. Ward had
pleaded privilege and run away. Judge
Lowe reported that no document was
missing and that Mr. Ward had not been
informed by any of the persons respon-
sible for its custody that it ever was.
Thereupon John Curtin wrote to the
slanderer in these terms:
Because of the plea advanced by your
counsel vital questions in the terms or
reference were beyond the power of the
Royal Commission to deal with... .and have
not been decided The reasons which
caused me to direct you to abstain from
administration continue....! now repeat
my direction to you to abstain from
forming any of the duties of your office,
and have arranged for the Hon. a. J.
Holloway, M.P., to continue to act for
and in your place.
And so it went on till “Labor” returned
victorious from the elections and Caucus
voted Mr. Ward into the Ministry again.
But he did not go back to Labor and
National Service. Mr. Holloway con-
tinued in that office, Mr. Ward being
relegated to Transport and Externa!
Territories —which is another story.
John Curtin died too soon, and evi-
dently his views of Cabinet and Mimstenal
responsibility and decency died with turn.
He was no model of consistency or for-
titude, but there was no “larrikin strain
in his policyj


PLAIN ENGLISH
Was Keane a Crook?
Twice ' here asked, the question goes
unanswered. There was a House debate
on Friday in which Mr. Holt led for the
Opposition and Mr. White, a predecessor
of Mr. Keane as Minister of Customs,
supported him. Both made telling points.
After an exhibition of special pleading by
the Attorney-General and of sob-stuff by
the Prime Minister the gag was moved.
But “the cloud,” as Mr. Holt called it,
remains.
The “Government’s” No. 1 and No. 2
referred in vague condemnation to press
comments. They felt particularly, but
did not say so. The Bulletin’s question
“Was Keane a Crook?” Great numbers
of people are also asking that and will
go on asking it.
That is the reason why the Govern-
ment must hold the inquiry it disingenu-
ously refused. An inquiry can be forced
by public opinion. The “suspicions”
have not been removed by anything Mr.
Chifley and Dr. Evatt said in answer to
Mr. Holt and Mr. White. Every party
concerned in the affair was either con-
nected with the Customs or had been
connected with it —except Goldberg,
the man prosecuted (unsuccessfully)
by the Government, and he was
Keane’s “very dear friend.” The
goods were bought in America with
dollars. They were then packed, labelled
and dispatched to Australia by people
in the Customs administration (Gold-
berg’s part in any of this only excepted).
The irregularity is'patent, because (only
after pressing interjection) the Attorney-
General disclosed that the goods are “still
held by the Customs.”
Who owns those goods? Are they
Senator Keane’s, part of his estate, or
somebody else’s? They were addressed
to Mrs. Keane by Keane’s secretary (after
the ’Senator’s death) or by his instruc-
tions.
How in the circumstances could any
purely departmental inquiry either point
the bone at the late Minister, or lay the
burden on his immediate servants, and
departmental officers present on the
mission with him, without also involving
the late Minister? Cannot the Prime
Minister see that the very refusal to order
a full inquiry keeps these suspicions alive,
and even nourishes them? The very fact
that he and his colleague have in debate
gone right up to the essential question
and then avoided it makes a bad business
look immeasurably worse.
The names of senior Customs officials
were bandied about in the debate. The
permanent head of their department
ought himself, whomever he offends, to
press for an inquiry.
"Philosophy 11 and Cold War.
What Mr. Chifley has chosen to describe,
in an attempt to save his own face, as a
“philosophy” has cost Australia dearly
these past few years. Communist unions,
according to an analysis made by Re-
search Service, Sydney, are by far the
most prolific initiators of industrial
trouble ; the average number of days lost
per member of other unions in the period
Sept., 1945, to Dec., 1947, was 1.5, but
the loss in the Communist group was
23.1, or nearly 16 times as great.
Including miners, Corn-dominated
unions, representing 26 p.c. of union
membership, were responsible for 84 p.c.
of the man-days lost in N.S.W. through
strikes during the period surveyed. Ex-
cluding miners, the Com group, repre-
senting 22 p.c. of union members, was
responsible for 76 p.c. of the man-days
lost.
“A definite method of Communist
tactics” is reported by Research Service.
“As soon as one union has ceased its
dispqte another union creates a new dis-
pute.” And factual evidence is offered
to prove this up to the hilt, the iron-
workers, waterside-workers and painters
and dockers ringing the changes with
regularity, with the coalminers in a class
of their own. Nearly all the strikes in
vital industries are brought about by the
Communist party. And yet, let it be re-
peated, Corn-dominated unions represent
no more than 22 p.c. of union member-
ship outside the coalminers.
Mr. Chifley is unable to distinguish
between a “philosophy” and what
amounts to the Australian front of the
Cold War. He is too busy with his own
maudlin “philosophy” that prompts him
to reflect upon the circumstances by
which, “with the help of his comrades,”
he rose to be Prime Minister, starting at
the point where he himself went on strike
in 1917.
Vanished Shipping.
When last Friday the Marine Phoenix
cleared Port JaSkson for San Francisco
Australian shipping ties across the Pacific
with North America ceased to exist. Not
since Federation, indeed for most of a
century past, has that happened before.
There are no Australian freight or pas-
senger ships to pick up the run.
Australia, “a leading Pacific Power”
according to Our Foreign Policy, has, in
this respect, gone off the Pacific map.
Visiting businessmen from Britain- and
America this past 12 months have urged
the servicing of ships in port here within
reasonable time. They might as well
have talked to North Head. American
running costs are high, anyway. But
Australian methods helped to put the
Phoenix some £lO,OOO in the red every
trip she made to Sydney. So now the
Pacific - service is one with the Java
service. That has been simply wiped
outright by the Australian wharfies’
union since Chifley’s Golden Age began
in 1945.
Even with N.Z. all definite Australian
shipping connections will cease after the
Wahine leaves Sydney on her last run in
the middle of May.
Mr. CaLwell pretends astonishment that
he can’t get overseas ships for carriage
of immigrants. Shipping men have been
telling him the reasons ever since his
“Government” took office: that go-slow
and hold-up tactics by one Communist-
bossed union, and the scarcity of bunker-
coal denied by another, make voyages to
Australia a nightmare to shipowners.
In the Australian coastal trade those
vessels which remain in service must spend
twice as long in port as they did before
the war, expend twice as much on main-
tenance and overhaul, and function
chiefly for the benefit of those first-class
tourists of the Communist-bossed Sea-
men’s Union known as ships’ crews. The
new law declaring our ships unfit tor
seamen’s travel after the age of 25 years
is rapidly wiping out the remaining Aus-
tralian mercantile fleet also.
The costs of this sabotage, of course,
go on to every cargo (or to that part of
it unpillaged) which is delivered to con-
signees in our home-consumption mar-
ket. And the unionists’ wives wonder
why costs of living rise!
Japan’s ports are busy enough, and
when Japan’s mercantile marine takes the
seas again—and eventually no treaty in-
hibitions can forbid it—there will arise
a wail in this country about our shipping
business being lost to Asiatic competi-
tion. Australian “Labor” can take the
blame for that all to itself.
On the transatlantic run a week ago
the Queen Mary discharged in New
York*a full load of passengers and cargo
and was reloaded and sailing again in
25 minutes short of 24 hours. But a
news-item like that would not register
with Mr. Chifley and his Minister for
Shipping and Fuel.
Bunnerong No-Power House.
Written by an infuriated customer:
In the words of its chairman, Cr. Cramer,
the Sydney County Council “could not allow
disorganised blackouts to continue because of
unfair and inequitable distribution of available
electricity,” so it asked Minister Cahill (Local
Government) to organise blackouts. Whether
those who depend upon the S.C.C.’s Bunnerong
powerhouse for electric light and power will
find organised blackouts better than disorganised
one is another matter. Those who depend upon
electricity-supply companies like the one at
Balmain, and who so far have not suffered
from blackouts, fiercely object to the S.C.C.
notion that Mr. Cahill should “include in the
scheme all electrical-supply authorities in the
metropolitan area.”
Sydney people dependent on the County
Council are tired of the whole show. They
find their electricity cut off without warning at
all sorts of times, the causes being strikes at
the plant itself, on the coalfields whence it
draws its fuel, or in transport of the coal.
When it isn’t strikes it’s an alleged lack of
generating plant. Perhaps its failure isn’t to be
wondered at in the light of its history.
Bunnerong was born in a scandalous
atmosphere, practically an illegitimate child
of Labor politics. When it was being
built (Feb., 1927) under a Sydney Labor
Council there was “trouble” when the
1200 men on the job threatened to strike
over the upholstery in the free buses that toted
them to and from work, and because somebody
objected to paying them for a holiday taken
without leave. It became involved in a scandal
that blew the existing Sydney City Council out of
(Continued on page 10.')
“WE WILL REMEMBER THEM.”
Literature in Handcuffs.
Robert S. Close’s Love Me, Sailor, held
by a Melbourne jury to be an obscene
libel, is not a pleasant book. It seems
to have been designed to lead up to the
two words with which it concludes,
spoken when a drowned woman is hauled
up out of the sea; “She stank,” It is
nasty in the way Baudelaire’s poetry is
nasty, but without Baudelaire’s compen-
sating genius.
Such a work is best left to perish of its
own weakness. Prosecution can serve
no useful purpose. Cultivated readers
would merely smile at the book ; perverts
whose minds might be inflamed by it are
unlikely to read it while they are so well
catered for by the sex stories in the daily
and Sunday papers ; and they are, in any
case, already perverted. Allowing for the
literary inferiority of Love Me, Sailor,
what the Hon. John Woolsey said when
Ulysses was before the U.S. Courts is
exactly applicable to the case: —
I am quite aware that Ulysses is rather
a strong draught to ask some sensitive,
though normal, persons to take. But my
considered opinion, after long reflection, is
that, whilst in many places the effect of
Ulysses on the reader is undoubtedly some-
what emetic, nowhere does it tend to be an
aphrodisiac. Ulysses may, therefore, be ad-
mitted into the United States.
And if it can do no good, prosecution
can, and will, do much harm. From the
social viewpoint, if the book is indeed
dangerous to mental health, the Mel-
bourne decision will make it widely
sought-after, and the newspaper publicity*
quite as inflammatory as the novel, will
reach thousands who would never have
read the book.
From the literary viewpoint the prose-
cution will intimidate both authors and
publishers; it will encourage lying and
sentimentality in Australian writing; it
will foster that provincial illusion that all
msntion of sex in the arts should be
taboo. And if Close’s book is obscene
it is not so objectionable to the civilised
mind as the spectacle of Literature in
handcuffs, being led from a courthouse
to a jail.

office. Tenders for plant were “irregularly
opened,’’ a tender £3OOO above the lowest was
accepted, a tenderer was told to put up £15,000
for “distribution’’ if he wanted the job. Accom-
paniments, morosely criticised, were deals in
municipal property and in Italian cars, and an
£BOO,OOO turbo-alternator contract. All this
came to light when the City Council was super-
seded by a Commission. In subsequent pro-
ceedings Silas Maling, acting general-manager
of the Council’s electricity department, was
found guilty of taking a bribe of £10,600. He
got six months and was fined £5OO, the inquiring
Judge Harvey being satisfied that £7500 or
£BOOO of the bribe went to a “Labor” alderman
for division among other “Labor” aldermen,
share-and-share-alike —perhaps.
The published reason for locating the site at
Matraville, on Botany Bay, within easy range
of hostile warships (during the 193945 war the
towering chimneys were cut down, with un-
explained consequences to' boiler draught and
power output) was a belief that it would be
sitting on top of a coalfield. The coal was never
seriously tested. Apropos of which a non-
Labor alderman of the period was heard to
remark, “A good many years 'i'll pass and
a good many aldermen will be dead before the
Sydney municipal colliery exercises any influ-
ence on the situation; but if they die in com-
fortable circumstances it will mitigate the world-
wide sorrow.” In later days the Sydney County
Council took the place over. After the wars
about the first thing Sydney discovered was that
around 700 “maintenance men” had jobs there—
they’d struck over something or other —and that,
although there was no increase in plant, the
pre-war staff of about 400 had been almost
trebled, a direct result of which seems to be
that the power output has been cut by a third.
The latest ukase is that winter radiators are
“out” and that industry will have to along
somehow with a powerless half-day every week.
Bunnerong was cradled in corruption and has
become a full-grown model of inefficiency.
POLITICAL POINTS
Chifley must have had long thoughts
of a Curtin precedent, suspension of
Ward from office in 1943, when he
heard Ward defending Soviet policy,
as on Thursday night Ward did all
along the line, even to the extinction of
Czechoslovak democracy (“Communist
sympathisers were in a majority in that
country’s Parliament,” a brazen false-
hood), and yelping at United States
policy. That is if Chifley does not
share his Minister’s provocatively
dangerous opinions and did not connive
at his saying what Chifley was not game
to say himself.
The Sydney A.L.P. executive has sus-
pended its Darlinghurst branch. Garden
was president and Ward is the member,
and “their supporters clashed” on the
“eligibility” of persons whose subs, had
been accepted and —yes —op “other
matters.” And Senator Donald Grant
complained of—yes again—“a whisper-
ing campaign against Mr. Ward.” But
when the feelings of “Labor” factionists
are thoroughly aroused do they merely
whisper?
Chifley is never so unconvincing as
when he assumes an air of benign sim-
plicity and rustic faith in his fellow-
men except those he compliments by
hating. He assumed it before he had the
Keane debate gagged, saying Keane
couldn’t have given Goldberg 3000 dol-
lars' for the purchase of feminine finery
—enough to stock a shop—because he
had “only 3400 dollars” from the “Gov-
ernment,” Chifley might as well have
“argued” that Goldberg couldn’t have
made his 1947 pilgrimage to the U.S.A.,
and that Wren can’t be importing negro
pugs by the crate, because their permitted
dollar credits would have failed them.
For Wren it has been stated that he has
“dollar reserves” in the U.S.A. Keane
could have had “dollar reserves.”
Goldberg said to the Customs men,
apropos of Keane, “You or anybody else
wouldn’t know how many dollars he
had.” This must have influenced those
who, after a “departmental conference”
in August, 1946 (Holt brought out the
fact and date), sanctioned the prosecu-
tion which led to the conviction in April,
1947, upset on appeal in April, 1948.
Keane was not Goldberg’s only acquaint-
ance among Ministers. For a whole year
it was open to any of them to give him
the lie about those dollars, but none did.
Archie Cameron, with his knack of
seeing his way through a question and get-
ting to the heart of a matter, brought it
out that the dollar goods which Goldberg
bought for Keane and added to with his
own dollars are still in Customs custody.
It will be awkward if Keane’s executors
or some nark of a Victorian probate
officer claim that they are part of the
Keane estate.
In a moment of folly the N.S.W.
Police Association conference decided by
the smallest possible majority to carry
their organisation into the Sydney Labor
Council, which for 30 years has been
stiff with Communists. On ■ second
thoughts, prompted by powerful protests
and talk of wholesale resignations, it
agreed to put “affiliation” to a vote of
members; and before members mark
their ballot-papers' they should think hard
on what happened during the Communist
blockade of Queensland and what might
have happened there. Had the Brisbane
police belonged to the Brisbane Labor
Council they would certainly have re-
ceived orders from the Communist sec-
retary Healy (formerly McCracken) to
stand aside with folded'arms and let the
Communist mobs do their worst. No
doubt they would have done their duty,
as they did, manfully and victoriously;
but the moral is plain. No body of police
should place itself in a situation which
may lead to a conflict of loyalties when
the King’s peace is or may be threatened.
Fines and costs amounting to £132
were imposed in Brisbane last week on
“Michael Healy, Labor Council secretary,”
for what Bennett, K.C., instructed by the
Crown Solicitor, called “deliberate and
premeditated defiance” of the Hanlon In-
dustrial Law Amendment Act as “a law-
breaking leader.” The quoted words
were the K.C.’s, and there were others:
Healy’s police history shows that his
name was Francis McCracken, alias John
Healy, alias Michael Healy, and that he
was convicted of armed robbery in Belfast
(Ireland) in 1923 and of two relief frauds
in Brisbane in 1935.
The bit about Belfast was denied by
Healy’s counsel and was not taken into
account by the magistrate. Healy did not
go into the box. He was given time to
pay, a month in one case and two months
in another: “in default, levy and distress ;
in default, three months.”
The staggering circumstance emerges
from a perusal of 1947 census figures,
that of 234,989 persons added to Vic-
toria’s population in 14 years, Melbourne
bagged all but two. It is thought that
the two are officers of the Decentralisa-
tion department, stationed respectively at
Reedy Dam and Dog Flat.
The latest move in the Hollway Gov-
ernment’s long-range plan to make Vic-
toria independent of N.S.W, coal strikes
is a Ministry of Mines and Fuel with
general powers of control, including the
huge projected increase in brown-coal
workings. Meantime the Melbourne
housewife faces cuts in gas, electrical
power and lighting, and Kent Hughes
(Transport) says the black-coal position
is as bad as it could be.
Chifley’s most effusive admirers are the
chaps who write Canberra notes for
two Sydney Sunday papers. One, the
“Telegraph” man, beat the “Sun” in the
weekly Guff Stakes with this:
Chif has agreed to the shipment of big
supplies qf steel to the Netherlands East
Indies to speed up reconstruction of oilfields
in Sumatra and Borneo.
Objective: To help the Indies step up
production, enabling the fields to supply
about 80 per cent, of Australia’s petrol.and
oil cut down costs on tanker freights
and help Australia and the Empire to
save dollars. Australia would pay in
sterling for oil and petrol from N.E.I.
fields. Chif agreed to make it clear to his
Ministers and the foreign-affairs experts
that he would stand no nonsense in a
foreign policy designed to get more petrol
and oil from the N.E.I.
“He would stand no nonsense”! This
when the hero to this valet journalism
has done nothing bu,t crawl to the Com-
munists who have blockaded the N.E.I.
and stifled its recovery since September,
1945.
It should not escape attention 'that
Colombia, scene of the Communist-led
riot which destroyed the capital, Bogota,
and Costa Rica, where simultaneously
another civil war was begun, are in the
Panama Canal zone, A week or so
earlier strange submarines of a German
ocean-going type like those acquired by
the Soviet were sighted off the Cali-
fornian coast.
Fresh from his win over the Com-
munists ’and with his thoughts on the
war in which he served, the one in which
Queensland was a frontier State, Hanlon
went on the air and asked all hands to
forget all about the strikes and get down
to work. He said “We have a God-
given breathing-space to make our land
safe for our children and their children,”
A pity this sort of realism doesn’t in-
terest Canberra.
Francis Michael Forde, sometime
M.H.R. for Capricornia and Army
Minister, and now “our Minister to
Canada,” was one of the judges in the
“great international quiz,” a great waste
of tax-money and of listeners’ time. Men-
tion of the name stirred a few memories
faintly. F.M.F. had nothing to say £ Pre-
sumably he will call for a report
From Illinois (U.S.A.) come reports
of people seeing a strange bird, “grey-
green and as big as a plane,” flying over-
head. Possibly Our Foreign Policy,
changing its plumage again in mid-flight.
Canberra’s acceptance of the inter-
national wheat agreement doesn’t end the
matter. Hollway is to seek legal opinion
on its validity, and Playford has come
out for a ballot of growers. It was
a ballot of growers in S.A. which wrecked
the first Scully “stabilisation” scheme.
These growers seem to think that any-
thing they grow on their land is their
own to sell as they choose —though if
the prices and charges referendum is
carried “Labor,” when in office, will al-
ways have power to sell their produce at
a third of the world price, as it did with
the wheat sold to N.Z. “Labor” at ss. 9d.
When it takes seven (7) P.M.G. em-
ployees to put a telephone into a private
house, already wired, as happened in
Vaucluse, the P.M. hasn’t far to look to
find out why production is slipping.
When Haddock no, Finnan was
McGirr’s Minister for Week-ends Bad-
deley came out against a McGirr election
promise to make shopkeepers deliver
goods. Then Haddock —sorry, Finnan—
was transferred to Labor and Industry,
and he promptly produced a make-’em-
deliver bill. When somebody mentioned
truck and petrol shortages he said shop-
keepers could use horses or push-bikes,
overlooking the fact that cart-horses are
slaughtered and cut up to maintain
“that good and useful sport greyhound-
racing.” Some people tip that the Leg.
Council will regard the thing as unwork-
able, but Shaddock (or Haddock)
-is undismayed.
Immediately Brown, the Communist
A.R.U. secretary, learned that Hollway
intended bringing down a bill to ban the
Communist party his president, Cregan,
began issuing all A.R.U. press statements.
Brown’s name has been absent from Mel-
bourne papers since late in March. He
and Runaway Rowe are two of a kind.
Labor didn’t believe in 1915, as does
the present concern trading under that
name, that a clique in a Caucus could
arbitrarily shorten or extend the six-year
term for elected Senators, twice specified
in the Constitution. In a referendum
pamphlet prepared that year the party
proposed to alter constitutional Section
13(1) “by making the terms of the Senate
and of the House, after a double dissolu-
tion” (there was one in 1914), “begin on
the same day” and (2) “by adding two
months to the three years’ interval be-
tween Senate elections.” Other things
happened and there was no referendum.
But the party was express on the point
that alteration of the terms of Senators
would 'not be valid without a ratifying
referendum, and the obligation remains.
Sheehy asked Dedman, representing
Ashley, when S.A. could expect to get
a bit more N.S.W. coal. Dedman replied
that the River Loddon, Aroona, Bellerby
and Inchcrag, totalling 25,300 tons, would
leave for S.A. with coal on April 10 and
11. Announcing more gas rationing in
coal-starved Adelaide, P. G. Bice of the
State Coal Committee said he had it
from the Joint Coal Board that Dedman’s
statement was “incorrect.”
Only the Inchcrag will leave on April 10.
The River Loddon left Newcastle on Wed-
nesday, April 7, and is oil-bunkering in
Sydney. Bellerby is expected to begin load-
ing coal at Newcastle on April 12. Sailing
of Aroona had been cancelled.
Whereupon Adelaide went wearily Out
into the backyard looking for bits and
pieces of wood to make a cup of tea.
To a Hobart “Mercury” writer “there
appears little likelihood that the Govern-
ment will introduce legislation dealing
with the liquor traffic.” Just as well for
Tasmania, considering that the “legisla-
tion” would most probably be on the
lines of that passed by “Labor” in N. S.
Wales. That “reform” measure, so-
called, consolidated the tied-house evil,
gave an open go to publicans, whether
they close their bars when it pleases
them or sell most of their spirituous and
fermented by the backyard route, and
abolished what was left of local option.
The result in the last case is a brisk traffic
in transfers of licences from seedy over-
pubbed districts to decent residential
suburbs which have been publess by
choice.
By 650 votes to 150 the Queensland car-
penters declared that Sharpe, their presi-
dent —branded as a Communist, though
he pleaded innocence—had lost their con-
fidence, going on to reject “overwhelm-
ingly” an appeal to them to vote Yes at
the prices-and-charges referendum. The
first resolution may have left Chifley’s
withers unwrung, but the other must have
Who told Chifley the “Conservative”
Government in Britain gave a go-as-
you-please signal to Communists even
during the blitz? Perhaps one of those
Macquarie A.L.P. Assembly Reds who,
after the 1943 election, and in Chifley’s
presence. Commanded Parliament by
resolution “to make it clear to Mr.
Churchill that the people of Australia
feel involved in the disgrace that the
British Cabinet has incurred through its
failure to fulfil the promise to relieve
the intolerable burden borne by the
Russians.” In point of fact, the Govern-
ment of the period—not “Conservative”
but National suspended the Com-
munist “Daily Worker” for two years as
punishment for preaching sedition and
surrender to Hitler during the blitz. And
the agent of retributive justice was
Labor’s own Herbert Morrison.
“Macnell” goes to a meeting:
Communists are a well-disciplined herd. At
a debate with the Liberal I. C. Black, M.L.A.
(subject, “Should the Communist party be
banned?”), Comrade Rupert Lockwood of the
“Tribune” had merely to wave his hand to
silence boos and jeers at Black. When the
latter shafted a point home the Boss remained
still and the cacophony ran its full gamut.
Communism, to Lockwood and mob, “aims
at progress by peaceful democratic methods.”
Examples: the near-starvation of thousands of
workers’ wives and children in Queensland; the
mob threats to wives of unionists back on the
job; the tearing-up of Industrial Court ballot-
papers. An advocate for banning asked
where the party’s money comes from. “Out
of the workers’ pockets,” a Com. bellowed.
Game the retort, “It would be better in the
workers’ pockets.” There was no answer to
that one.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Deputy-Premier of Victoria, John
Gladstone McDonald, who also has
charge of water-supply and soldier-set-
tlement, came out from Scotland as a
lad ; his family settled in the Shepparton
district. At 16 he enlisted in the A.1.F.,
was seriously wounded in France and
given up for dead. After months in hos-
pital he won through and was invalided
back to Australia. Jack claims he learnt
more about his .adopted country from his
A.I.F. cobbers than he could possibly
have done in a lifetime of peace. His
mates appointed him banker, and they
recall today that he was a tough nut to
get money from. He wouldn’t part with
a sou until he knew how it was to be
spent. After the war he went in for
fruitgrowing; today he has a property
out of Shepparton and another at Cob-
ram, on the Murray. In 1936 he won the
Shepparton seat, became a force in the
Country party, and three years ago suc-
ceeded Dunstan as leader. His passion
in life is water and irrigation. At an
election-meeting a questioner asked him
what he would wish for if he was given
one wish that would come true. He re-
plied : “My wish would be to see flowing
gold irrigating every acre in this State.”
And he meant it. Through his energy
the State acquired 65,000 acres of fine
land between Shepparton and Cobram
for soldier-settlement, Some 700 Diggers
will be settled there.
Pluck, ingenuity and extraordinary
luck enabled Signaller Graham Chisholm
to survive to receive the British Empire
Medal (Military Division). An announcer
on Radio Australia, he was a p.-0.-w.
in Sumatra with a fixed determination to
keep up communication with the outside
world, and he succeeded in doing so for
nearly two years. A Japanese guard on
one occasion actually opened the box
in which his secret radio was lying doggo,
but, knowing a Jap can’t resist a photo.,
the signaller started handing round snaps
and the guard’s interest was diverted.
His next hiding-place was his bed, and
though guards searched his prison times
without number, he still had the set when
the Japs surrendered. He promptly
rigged up a transmitter and, getting in
touch with an Indian station, gave the
authorities the location of a camp where
a number of Australian nurses were in-
terned at Luboklingau. A few hours
later a Liberator was dropping food
parcels.
Old cruiser Adelaide’s fate —whether
she will be scrapped or used as target-ship
for her modern, multi-gunned sisters —is
now being decided. Awaiting the decision
with interest is her first commanding
officer, Rear-Admiral (Retd.) J. B.
Stevenson, C.M.G. A boy with the
Mediterranean Fleet, he was in battle-
ship Camperdown when, in one of the
R.N.’s worst disasters, she drove her
armed stem into the vitals of H.M.S.
Victoria during Fleet manoeuvres. Jellicoe
was then Victoria’s executive officer.
Coming to Australia in 1911, Stevenson
was appointed first-lieutenant of the old
six-incher Encounter, and in her searched
fo,r Von Luckner’s Seeadler, finally meet-
ing her on a coral reef. Given the coveted
command of Adelaide, then our newest
cruiser, he sailed her with the, Special
Service Squadron, comprising Hood,
Repulse and four cruisers, on its flag-
showing cruise in 1924. This was the first
time in recorded history the Royal Navy
wilted under the stress of social engage-
ments. Stevenson was Captain-in-Charge,
Sydney, when he finally came ashore in
1931. In the last war his son was
shot down in a Spitfire over Dunkirk.
Younger son, John Philip, carried on the
naval tradition in destroyer Nestor when
she was one of the pack hunting
Bismarck, and was still in her when Stuka
bombs opened her sides off Crete. He is
now navigator of a R.N. frigate. Asked
his opinion of the present-day Navy, the
admiral declined to comment; though
the writer heard a deep-sea mumble about
“air-conditioned wardrooms! ”
Back in Australia visiting old friends
and seeing something of the results of
the Henderson scheme for Australia’s
naval defence is Rear-Admiral Sir Eldon
Manisty, K.C.8., C.M.G., who, after be-
ing in retirement for a decade, made one
of the most spectacular comebacks in
British Admiralty history during the late
war. A broadcast given by him on the
convoy system so impressed their Lord-
CONVOY EXPERT.
ships that he was called back in an
advisory capacity—he had been organis-
ing manager of convoy in the 1914-18
war. Manlsty started life in the R.N. as
a pay-clerk, went to China in 1900 and
was in the relief of Peking’. Promoted
paymaster in 1903 and then secretary to
the Admiral of Coastguards, he became
a barrister-at-law, Gray’s Inn, in 1908.
Coming to Australia with Admiral Sir
Reginald Henderson in 1910, he stayed
on as finance member and secretary to the
Australian Naval Board. He has a son in
the R.N. and another a master at Win-
chester. Holidaying, his only regret about
Australia is that it does not increase
its population as envisaged in the Hen-
derson plan.
When Lud Mayor Connelly goes to
London to push the claims of Melbourne
as location for the 1956 Olympic Games,
he will meet an old friend in International
Olympic Committee president Sigfrid
Edstrom, who has been connected
with the Olympic movement for 50 years.
Edstrom has visited Australia, and was
struck all of a heap by the national
obsession for sport and the high standard
of Australian athletics. A big Swedish
executive, he is a former managing-direc-
tor of Swedish General Electric and
president of the Swedish Chambers of
Commerce. For 34 years he was
President of the International Amateur
Athletic Federation.
With the death in Sydney of Dr. A.
E. Platt at the early age of 46, medical
research in Australia suffered a loss it
could ill afford. Shortly after graduating
M. 8.8.5. at Sydney Uni. in 1927, he
began research work in pathology under
Professor Welsh, and in 1929 went as
medical officer to New Guinea, where he
established the first Pathology Labora-
tory in those parts. After three years up
north he moved to London to study under
Professors Topley and Wilson at the
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medi-
cine. He gained a diploma in bacteriology
and, went on to Cambridge as Gwyneath
Pretty Research Student. From Cam-
bridge he returned to Australia as head
of the department of bacteriology at
■Adelaide ’Varsity and bacteriologist to
Royal Adelaide Hospital. Before long
a chair in bacteriology was established
in Adelaide, and he was the natural choice
as first occupant. During a visit to Cam-
bridge in 1940 Platt studied the Greaves
and Adair method of drying blood-serum,
and on his return to Adelaide he organised
the Army’s blood-drying unit; the im-
portance of that work requires no em-
phasis, At the time of his death he was
director of the Institute of Epidemiology
and Preventive Medicine, Sydney, and
also of the department of pathology.
Prince Henry Hospital.
A father whose 14-year-old son could
not walk or talk and could only get across
a room by “swimming” was one of
hundreds of parents of spastic children
who travelled up to 200 miles to listen to
Dr. Earl Carlson, himself a spastic, at
Royal Melbourne Hospital. A world
authority on cerebral palsy. Dr. Carlson
is as brilliant an example of how faith
and will can overcome a physical dis-
ability as Helen Keller. At 18 he could
neither feed nor dress himself, and the
death of his parents left him with less
hope than ever. With iron will he trained
his limbs to work, got a job as a librarian,
studied for his medical degrees and
graduated from Yale University. Now
director of his own institution, which has
benefited thousands, he is on a world tour
with the nurse whom he married.
Dead, at 68, in Melbourne, Brigadier
Eric Fairweather Harrison, formerly
Director of Military Art at Duntroon and
its commandant in 1929-31 and 1940-42.
He served with the Third Division in World
War I, and during the 1920 s held various
positions in the Australian Military
Forces, including the post of Director of
Operations and Intelligence. In 1925-26
he was attached to the General Staff at
the War Office in London. He spent six
years in the Federal Parliament as
member for Bendigo. In recent years he
had been president of the Victorian Em-
ployers’ Federation. Born in Sydney, he
was a Cambridge M.A.
Eighty-seven today, S. Talbot Smith, of
Adelaide —a Bulletin contributor for
over half a century —maintains his interest
in public affairs. He’s president of the
S.A. Public Library Board and the Ade-
laide Repertory Theatre, and a member
of the S.A. Advisory Committee of
A.B.C. In the long ago he graduated
M.A. at Trinity College, Cambridge, and
was called to the Bar of the Middle
Temple. He practised law in Adelaide,
but his real interests in life have been
literature, art and the theatre. He is a
past-president of the Adelaide Art Gal-
lery and the Literary Societies Union, and
was on the Council of Adelaide Univer-
sity for over 20 years, Adelaide radio
audiences know him as one of the know-
ledgeable gentlemen of the “Information,
Please” session on SAD.
State president of R.S.L. in South
Australia, Arthur Blackburn, V.C., is also
a Commonwealth Conciliation Commis-
sioner. He was called to the Adelaide
Bar in 1913, and had just commenced
practice when the Kaiser’s war broke out.
Blackburn sailed with the Tenth Battalion,
was in the landing at Gallipoli, and, a
little over a year later—he had gained
his commission by then —won the V.C.
for gallantry in a particularly sticky piece
of fighting in the capture of Pozieres.
TWICE-RETURNED SOLDIER.
Invalided home, badly wounded, he re-
sumed his legal practice and put in three
years in the S.A. Assembly as member
for Sturt. When the second war came
he was City Coroner in Adelaide. He
rejoined the A.1.F., led “Blackforce” on
a forlorn hope in Java, and spent three
years in Jap prison camps. With intimate
experience of the Diggers of two wars.
Blackburn, V.C., is well equipped to deal
with the problems and blend the points
of view of the old and new contingents
of League members.
Arthur Rickard, who has' passed on in
Sydney at 79, was chairman of the
N.S.W. committee of Dr. Barnardo’s
Homes. Born at Currawang (N.S.W.),
he built up a large real-estate busi-
ness, and was on the board of several
public companies. In 1912 he founded
the Millions Club, which still flourishes
and holds weekly luncheon-meetings at
Svhich members are addressed by guest-
speakers from all walks of life. He was
knighted in 1920, and in 1926 was an
Australian delegate to the League of
Nations Assembly.
“Uramao”: Dr. Murray A. Falconer,
who won a Nuffield Travelling Scholar-
ship, has returned after four months to
his job as head of the neuro-surgical De-
partment at Dunedin Hospital and lec-
turer in neuro-surgery at Otago Medical
School, He visited, as well as United
Kingdom centres, Canada and Sweden in
pursuit of knowledge on his branch of
science. While at Oxford he was under
Sir Hugh Cairns. Dr. Falconer qualified
from the Otago Medical School in 1933 ;
in 1937 was assistant surgeon at the Mayo
Clinic, Rochester, U.S.A., and in 1947
was admitted to the Royal College of
Surgeons, England, as Hunterian Pro-
fessor. #
New A.O.C. of Southern Area
R.A.A.F., Air-Commodore A. L. Walters,
C.8.E., A.F.C., hails from Westralia.
He graduated from Duntroon in
1927, and after 12 months on the Staff
Corps was seconded to R.A.A.F. with the
rank of pilot-officer. Transferred to
R.A.A.F. in 1930, by 1937 he commanded
No, 22 Squadron at Richmond, faking
over No. 3 at the same station the fol-
lowing year. Early in the war he became
director of staff duties, and in 1941 he
took command of No. 1 Squadron. After
that he went to 72 Wing H.Q. and
Northern Command and saw service in
Darwin and New Guinea. In addition
to passing through the R.A.A.F. Staff
College at Andover in pre-war days he
has done an Imperial Defence College
course since the fighting stopped.
“F.S.”: I wonder what form G. N.
Edwick’s horticultural genius would
have taken in Australia, where
super-abundant sunshine has tended to
produce men like Farrer, who made it
possible to grow wheat in marginal-rain-
fall aj-eas. In Hertfordshire Edwick,
before the fuel shortage stopped
him, grew tomatoes and other vege-
tables in vast fluorescent-lighted glass-
houses. The lights threw yellow, red and
white rays from which the harmful rays
had been deleted, and he astonished
Londoners by producing tomatoes com-
pletely out of season. His experiments in
hydroponics —soilless farming—are world-
famous. He admits to having recently
made a lot of money, useful for his
future experimental work, out of
cucumbers, which, when the fixed price of
sixpence apiece was lifted, shot up to
6s. He has come here to settle his two
sons, aged 24 and 22, on the land and
incidentally to talk to the C.S.I.R. abopt
artificial farming. ,
Into the Silence:
In Wagga, at 90, Sahib Dad, Indian farmer
who came to Australia in 1888. Dressed in
traditional Indian clothes with a huge colored
turban, he was a widely-known figure in the
district.
In London, at 65, Arthur Prince, world-
famous ventriloquist who appeared several
times in Australian theatres. He had been
on the stage for half a century.
In Hartford, Connecticut, U.S.A., Dr. Hart-
ley W. Cross, a South Australian who became
professor of Economics at Connecticut Col-
lege and vice-chairman of a sub-committee
of economic advisers to President Truman. He
had planned to bring a group of students
from Columbia University to Australia and
New Zealand this year. A Gallipoli veteran,
he was 54 at the finish.
In Coleraine (Vic.), at 65, William Hollis
Pitcher, councillor in the shire of Wannon for
16 years, and a commissioner of the Colerame-
Casterton Waterworks Trust.
In Sydney, Tom Bailey Hawkes, managing-
director of Hawkes Bros., Geelong, president
of the Geelong Racing Club' and veteran of
two world wars. He was a member of the
V.R.C. and V.A.T.C., a former president of
the Geelong Club and Geelong Football Club.
Captured during the North African campaign,
he was a p.-0.-w. for four years.
In Sydney, Denis Gerity, Australian com-
poser, whb wrote the music of “Crescent Moon”
and numerous songs.


Society
"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Mac Hoots”: I am enchanted to learn
that my old friend Dr. C. E. M. load,
whose philosophical opinions have guided
my feet in the right direction for many
years—indeed, in all the right directions
and several wrong ones —has been sum-
monsed before a London magistrate to
explain why he avoided paying a railway
fare. The philosopher, it appears,
boarded the train at Waterloo station to
go to Exeter. After the train left Salis-
bury a collector asked for his ticket. “I
have no ticket,” said the Plato of our
time, “and I want to .pay from Salisbury.”
As my London “Times” has it, “Dr.
load then paid from Salisbury to Exeter,
so avoiding a fare of 17s. Id.” The
collector then asserted that the traveller
had come from Waterloo; a waiter
joined in and corroborated the statement;
and “in all the defendant denied four
times that he had come from Waterloo.”
All this is very human, and I am rather
sorry to record that Dr. load offered,
through his solicitor, an explanation that
it was all caused by a mistake of his
secretary; whereupon the magistrate
adjourned the case So that the philosopher
could alter his plea of “Guilty” to “Not
Guilty” and come along in person
to tell his story. It didn’t make much dif-
ference ; at the adjourned hearing he
copped a £2 fine, the maximum, and
£26 ss. costs. A final pleasing touch,
however, is that the magistrate was a
woman (Miss Sybil Campbell); I am
sure that Dr. load must have been a
feminist at some time or other. Possibly
he will now favor not merely the nation-
alisation, but the abolition, of railways—
or, at least, of ticket-collectors.

Beatrice GrimshawYeats (B.
14/4/’48)? He and I, both with
a youthful liking for preserves, used
to meet at the tea-rooms of the
Royal Dublin Society. I am afraid
to say how much jam we ate,
served in tiny glass jars; there’s no such
jam now—or maybe no such appetites.
While we ate, poems rolled from his lips,
mixed with green ginger and whole
strawberry. The attendant listened if I
did not. Being very young and not at all
appreciative of the honor done me, I used
to feel vexed when the long body of
Yeats, distinguished by a flapping black
cloak, a slouch hat and a loose bow-tie,
climbed the stairs of some slow-going
horse-tram to greet me and to read aldud,
careless of arhused fellow-passengers, his
latest poem. His voice, raised above the
groaning of the tram, might have been
heard, and possibly was, by pedestrians
on the pavement. Still, Dublin was Dub-
lin ; everybody knew the poet and con-
ceded him poetic licence. I wonder was
“Innisfree” among those unappreciated
masterpieces? I wonder did that heart-
felt cry for peace, half a century ago,
carry a prophecy to the young? I think
not. Adam Lindsay Gordon was the god
of the young and adventurous. Gordon it
was who lured me across the world.
Gordon knew all about horses and races ;
there was no “palely loitering” poesy
about him. He’d have put Keats and
Yeats on buckjumpers and roared with
laughter when they fell.

“Becks”: St. Philip’s Church, Sydney,
parish church of The Bulletin, is to
have a double celebration at the end of
next week to mark the centenary of the
laying of the foundation-stone and the
sesqui-centenary of the commencement
of the building of old St. Phillip’s. The
first church in Australia, built by the
JR,ev. Richard Johnson, is thought to have
been named St, Phillip’s in honor of the
first Governor. It was burnt down in
1798, and in the same year another St.
Phillip’s was erected, Governor Hunter
the foundation-stone. Fifty years
later it was succeeded by the present
structure, and an “1” was dropped from
the name to conform with the usual
spelling of the apostle Philip. The
foundation-stone was laid on May 1,
1848. The old church has copies of
marriage, baptismal and burial records
back to 1788, a Communion set presented
by George 111 in 1803 and also the first
Bible and Prayer Book used in Australia.
Historical lectures will be given in the
church on April 30 and special com-
memorative services on Sunday, May 2.

“Bo”: Some musical instruments, by
their very nature, seem to invoke humor.
In particular the trombone always arouses
merriment; it is the “funny” instrument
of an orchestra, and it certainly can
raise a Waggish voice when required. Yet
most trombonists I’ve met have been
serious-minded men who regard their in-
strument with deep respect. Conversely,
most players of the organ, which, in its
ecclesiastical setting, is not exactly an in-
strument calculated to arouse in its
executant a wild sense of fun, have, I’ve
noticed, been humorous-minded fellows.
Although scope for their humor is
circumscribed at the pedals, it occa-
“Do you mind if We play through you ?”
sionally breaks out, and I instance the
case of a suburban church organist
at a wedding. With a few tonics
aboard he had browsed over some
Bach while the guests were assem-
bling in the church. The ’groom, with
his seconds, took his place near the altar.
Five minutes passed; no bride, and Bach
still battling bravely on. Ten minutes, a
quarter of an hour; and still the bride
came not. The organist was getting a
kink in the neck through continuously
screwing around on the lookout for his
cue. At twenty minutes his sense of
humor broke its bonds and the organ
boomed out into “Oh, Dear, What Can
the Matter Be?”

“Grapin”: “O’Proof’s” treatise on
“pump, rum, copper” (B. 24/3/’4B) re-
minds me of the time when we were
billeted with the R.N. —18 Aussies among
1000 “kippers.” The authorities —evi-
dently regarding us as orphans deserving
of special attention —issued us with the
neat spirit instead of the usual two parts
of water to one of rum. Every drop
was carefully hoarded until we had
enough for a real binge. It was the best
night we spent on the station. Next day,
though, came the repercussions. Some
R.N. blokes had chosen our celebration
night for a “do” of their own, and two
of them had rounded off the evening’s
festivities by running loose in the Wren-
nery. Nothing was ever proved, but there-
after our grog issue was two-and-one,

“Niloc”; The outfit’s formal messes
became small riots whenever old
“Custard Guts,” the brigadier, was pre-
sent. By 10 o’clock he could usually be
relied on to have the unit’s officers hang-
ling like bats in the trees outside the
mess, singing all the old favorites as he
beat time with his waddy. One night
the troops were kept awake by muffled
yelps and explosions coming from the
hut. Next morning a tired mess-orderly
explained. The brig., when entering the
mess, had spied a piece of piping, used
as a “3in. mortar” for training. He
ordered it to be brought in and then bade
an officer to wake up the Q.M. and sign
for three dozen Aldershot grenades—
a type of glorified basket-bomb which
looked like an apple and was about as
dangerous. The brig, then set up his
“mortar” on the floor, primed it with
ignited Aldershots, and, using handfuls of
bottle-tops as ammo, trained it on the
officers who had sought refuge up among
the rafters. Any bloke in the unit would
have given quids to be the “No. 2” on
that mortar.

“No Sirrah”; The suggestion of germs
developing a resistance to # penicillin,
sulpha drugs and other panaceas holds
some frightening possibilities. Writers
have made our flesh creep with a picture
of a world ruled by insects; what if the
invisible germs and viruses should win
the battle? What sort of kingdom would
they set up? And would they develop a
communal intelligence sufficient to enable
them to keep enough human beings alive
to provide their homes and nourishment,
or would they find a substitute?

“X.S.”: Of interest to suburban gar-
deners is the decision of Judge Gamble
at Melbourne County Court regarding a
stately golden poplar growing at Malvern.
A maiden lady brought an action for
£lOO damages against her neighbors on
the ground that their tree had filled her
gutters with leaves, sent its roots and
suckers into her garden and depleted her
soil. The owner of the offending object
offered to remove the leaves and cut the
suckers, but the complainant wasn’t satis-
fied. His Honor found that people who
live in crowded suburbs must expect such
inconveniences as falling leaves, but
granted an injunction restraining defend-
ants from permitting any further root
encroachment. Damages, £ll 14s.

“Conda”: Hospital-ship Vita had good
reason to remember Australian de-
stroyers. On April 14, 1941, Waterhen
rescued the personnel of the bombed Vita
in the Mediterranean. Almost a year
later to the day Vampire’s men, struggling
in the water after Jap dive-bombers had
opened their ship, saw a merchantman
standing at speed towards them. It was
the refitted Vita, returning the favor.

“Ceg”: “4 Bees” (B. 17/3/’4B) gives a
list of postal matter dropped into his
mail-box after the arrival of his first-
born. Had he been living in America at
the time he would probably have also
received a letter from the local bank
offering congratulations and enclosing a
present of one dollar in the form of a
fixed-deposit receipt payable to the
youngster at the age of 21. This method
of “catching ’em young” was adopted
some years ago by a mid-Western bank;
I pass it on to Chif. for his One Big
Bank —if it eventuates.

“Hadit”: At a wayside eating-house
in a country town we inquired for grills.
The proprietor’s representative - cum -
waiter, a boy of about 16, replied, “We
have four chops and three eggs.” I
ordered chop and egg, tea, and bread
and butter for two. “All right,” said
Sixteen-year-old ; “it’ll cost you three and
ninepence each.” After dispatching the
meal —a very small chop, with egg to
match, garnished with one slice of tomato
and a small piece of lettuce, two very
thin slices of bread and a speck of
butter, I thanked the lad and asked why
he had told me the price before serving
the meal. “Listen,” said he, “I’ve been
telling ’em the price afterwards and I’ve
put up with their insults. I’ve had it.
Now I tell them the price first!”

“Percy Pawnticket”: Derision fills me
when I read suggestions that cafes spill-
ing themselves on the pavement, Parisian
fashion, would be an asset to Australian
cities. Most of those French cafes spill
themselves because of the abominable
dinginess of the interior. Actually
there is an open-air cafe in Darling-
hurst, Sydney; a party of us there,
one evening, had the ordinary delights of
regaling under the eyes of passing bus
travellers increased by the sudden arrival
of a southerly-buster. Small allowances
of street dust on the surface of our drinks
and comestibles we had overlooked, but
when pieces of dirty paper, blown gustily
in from the street, flew among us we
gave our alfresco junketing best. Roof-
garden cafes have been tried in Sydney.
The direct sun, welcomed in places like
Paris, where it is rare, was soon found
trying, and the awnings then provided
became useless when the sudden winds
arose. Patrons drifted indoors, and most
of these ventures were flops.

“Muskeen”; That hard winter on the
Somme (B. 31/3/ *4B) was 1916-17, not
1917-18, although the second winter was
nearly as bad in the Ypres salient, ex-
cepting that we did not have so much
frost. Early in 1917 it froze solid for six
weeks. The ground was too hard to take
a pick, the dead remained unburied, and
going up the line on duckboards covered
with inches of frozen mud made us as
expert if not so graceful as Sonja Henie.
Coming back from the line we were
billeted at Meaulte, and I had my full
share of vin, both rouge and blanc,
which produced a roaring thirst in
the early hours. Prepared for this, I had
a full water-bottle at my side and
attempted a swig, but the contents were
a solid block of ice.

“H.E.R.”: A Norwegian friend has at
last learnt how to pronounce the English
“j.” He proved this by bursting on a
group of us with the query, “Did jou

tell what the “yoke” was, or even if
Jorgen got as far as telling it.

“ ’Arry Garto”: A new twist to a war-
time New Guinea gag. Some 8.C.0.F.
blokes were hanging about the mess when
a rather snappy Japanese waitress passed
by. “Gosh,” murmured one of the flight-
loots, “there’s no doubt about it. These
women look whiter every day.” One of
his mates laughed. “You’ve been in this
country too long,’' he said. “No, I think
he is correct,” sighed swarthy, turbaned
Sikh, stroking his luxuriant growth of
face-foliage. “But to me they seem to
grow darker every day! *

“Standish”; I heard someone expressing
surprise that Jews and Arabs should both
have British battle-dress. My mind went
back to February, 1940, at Julis, I wakened
early and walked down the company
lines before reveille. No. 3 section was
sleeping soundly in the open air. The
guy-ropes were lying carelessly like small
snakes about 2ft. long; the centre-
pole and the top of their new E.P.I.P.
tent had disappeared. The platoon-
sergeant and I roared with laughter at
the expression and the swear-words of
the section when they realised that
Arabs had cut their guy-ropes and lifted
the whole tent, just like an umbrella,
while they slept. Later we raided a shop
in Jaffa and found Army blankets made
into overcoats, and the tents into the latest
things in galabiehs. Rifles were easier,
even when chained to the centre-pole, and
I remember an officer who slept with his
pistol under his head and awoke one
morning to find his holster containing
nothing but sand.

“Cine Ma”: I am interested in the
musical purge said to be taking place in
Moscow. I have heard some of the works
of Shostakovich and Shebalin, and they
seemed to me to be neither Soviet music
nor bourgeois, but just good music;
some of the most traditional of the com-
posers might have written parts of it.
The alleged reason for the purge is that
the Politburo has resolved to “purify
music along the lines of the simple rhythm
to which the workers can beat time and
hum as they accelerate production.” Well,
the kind of music that seems to fulfil
most completely that requirement, except
in the matter of accelerating production,
is jazz, swing, and their latest Americas
variants —typical bourgeois stuff and
therefore anathema to the Soviet arbiters
of art. So the purifiers of music will be
left with nothing but the triangles and
the big drum. When I was in Russia in
Czarist times the common soldier and the
peasant could sing their lovely folk-songs
in perfect unison'and harmony and would
burst into song in a railway-carriage
or a cafe, taking parts in a complicated
ballet or madrigal without direction.
Now, apparently, all they can do is to
beat time and hum while they accelerate
production.
PRO-NOTHING.
“Speaking in the debate on foreign affairs in the
House of Representatives, Mr. Ward said he was
‘neither pro-Soviet nor pro-American.’ ”
He’s thrown more bouquets to the Russian bear
Than anyone but Commos anywhere
Has ever hove yet,
But in the present-day imbroglio
Between contending Powers he’d have you know
He’s not pro-Soviet,
He scarce can have forgotten, one would say,
The help we asked and got from U.S.A.
So free and ready,
When deadly danger threatened from Japan.
And yet he isn’t pro-American,
We’re told by Eddie.
If Italy should join the Russian ring
He would deplore the fact, but anything
Designed to stop her
By those in non-totalitarian camps,
John Bull and Uncle Sam to wit, he stamps
As most improper.
Pro-Soviet or pro-American?
Some favor one and some the other clan,
But Ward is neither.
And from such indications as we’v<?' got
It seems a fair assumption that he’s not
Pro-British, either,
N.S.W.
PIPARDS.


“Plop”: Old Toby, whose lumbago
keeps a record of such things, told me
it was the coldest day for 50 years. As
I shivered on the train trip home I read
in the Sydney “Sun”: “Radiator and
heating firms did brisk business,” and
then, less than an inch down the same
column: “Because of the prospects of
power rationing, demand for radiators
was poor,” I put it down to some poor,
half-frozen sub-editor and read my
way through to the horses. Everyone on
the train was shivering with me, and
when I arrived home it was the same —
the wife, the baby, and the dog. I went
to switch on the jug for a cup of tea
when the wife told me there had been
power blackouts all day; to corroborate
her statement the kitchen light went out
again. I sat down, shivering, to wait for
the darned thing to come on. After
half an hour my nose was quite numb —
a bad sign, according to my Shackleton
—so I walked to the window to keep the
circulation going. The lights next door
were on! Groping my way across the
darkened kitchen I wrenched that blown
globe from its socket and hurled it far
into the night.

“M 8”: Stage fights, is it (B. 14/4/ ’48)?
The one we saw in our local production
of Shaw’s “Pygmalion” was all wool and
a yard wide. The audience, most of them
related in one form or another to the cast,
sat tensely awaiting Eliza Doolittle’s “Not
bloody likely!” and the star, a more-or-
less talented young woman of some 12-
stone-odd, missed her cue. The prompter,
who was also the producer, stage-manager
and secretary of the benefiting charity,
and who had slaved for,weeks for this
”He tells himself stories, and that stops him if he's
heard it before”
glorious moment, was momentarily
speechless. When his voice came it was
an explosion, heard all over the hall:
“ ‘Not bloody likely,’ you bloody idiot! ”
Through the astounded silence came the
star’s response: “Not bloody likely, you
bloody idiot!” Then, realising what had
occurred, she*leapt to the wings, grabbed
the prompter and assaulted him, while on
the stage and in the hall a long-simmering
feud between her supporters and those of
another Eliza burst into a fight that lasted
43 minutes by the clock.

“Jasby”: Doc. Evatt’s sage remark to
the High Court that “money is something
that is widely accepted for the settlement
of debts” was not a wasted platitude; it
enabled one of his opponents to enliven
the dull proceedings with the comment
that it was “a sound and logical submis-
sion,” and it was the peg on which “T.
the R.” hung a neat set of verses (B.
14/4/’4B). Although the statement was
uttered in court it was Evatt the politician
speaking rather than Evatt the lawyer.
Politicians seem naturally prone to that
sort of profound inanity. Coolidge, who
preceded President Hoover at the White
House, once delivered himself of a state-
ment worthy to be classed as an Evatti-
tude: “When large bodies of men find
themselves unable to obtain work, unem-
ployment exists.”

“Dong”; Giving one slant on compul-
sory newspaper-reading for pupils, my
schoolteacher friend advised me grimly
that when checking over the “interesting

a recent English paper for first-year can-
didates he found no fewer than five
“Guerrilla Hunters by R. M. Ballantyne.”

“Flathead”: My niece is a University
student, so we weren’t unduly surprised
when she drank, with ingenious sound-
effects, her cup of coffee from her saucer,
explaining “It’s the vogue there now.”
I was shaken later, though, when the wife
inquired what the object was protruding
from my niece’s giant-sized handbag.
“Oh, just a bike-pump,” she explained;
“I always carry it with me.” My wife
caught my eye and murmured optically
“Poor girl—studying too hard again.”
The lass was half-way through her sweets
before she added: “I parked the bike out-
side.”

“Dick Deadeye”: With the greatest
respect for the Army’s scrounging ability,
I cannot allow an Army quartermaster to
acquire the old “shov, wood” yarn (B.
7/4/’4B), which was current in the R.N.
half a century or more ago when I was
very young. One of a number based on
the difficulties and resourcefulness of the
older warrant-officers in dealing with the
store accounts for which they were re-
sponsible, the yam was published in a
book of naval sketches written, I fancy,
by Colonel Drury, R.M. The wooden
shovel was a survivor of the Napoleonic
wars, used for filling cartridges from the
powder-barrels in the magazine.

“Carlyle”: Horsham district (Vic.)
has nicknames for its transport, too
(B. 7/4/’4B). A pre-rail-cut train which
ran daily from Horsham to Melbourne
was termed by the Commissioners “The
Wimmera Flyer” ; to us it was always
“The Peanut.” Once again shape was
responsible: two ' carriages coupled to
an engine gave a peanut outline. Far
more obvious is the handle given to the
ancient rail-motor which chugs between
Horsham and Goroke. Painted for
safety with red and white stripes, it is
known as “The Tiger.”

“T.McN.”: Uttering the usual clap-
trap about later drinking hours making
for greater drunkenness, a couple of
Queensland “temperance” advocates are
about to surge round
the world to “survey
drinking conditions and
temperance work in 15
countries.” They could
save themselves the
trouble. On the day
that thes£ people really
bee ome temperance,
and not prohibition,
advocates, thousands of
Australians will rally
to their banners. And
what an opportunity
they’ve neglected in
Sydney in recent weeks!
A city notorious for
its beer consumption
has been comparatively
dry owing to a bung-
bashers’ strike in a
brewery, and hardened
topers as well as mode-
rate drinkers have had
time - to discover that
beer isn’t the all-im-
portant liquid it was
cracked up to be, that
six-o’clock closing is a
menace, and that far
fewer accidents and far
less crime occurred during the beer-
less weeks. These facts, capitalised
by earnest reformers in a cam-
paign for real temperance winch
can be attained through more reasonable
drinking hours, stricter supervision of
hotels and reforms in the licensing sys-
tem —would wipe out most of the liquor
abuses with which Sydney itself is
heartily fed-up. But total prohibition
hasn’t The Bolter’s chance for the very
good reason that good beer, drunk
leisurely at the right time and in modera-
tion, is a man’s drink,

“Jemac”; A U.S. Army sergeant with
no previous flying instruction pinched a
825 from Wright Field (Ohio) and flew
it unaided 600 miles to Minneapolis.
Memory stirs. We were flying at 10,000 ft.
above a sea as flat as a river. Our in-
telligence was good. Within a minute of
estimated sighting time, looking through
my side window, I saw the enemy cruiser
ahead and slightly left.
Co-pilot saw her at the
same time, I knew that
even one good hit, so far
from base, would finish the
raider’s career. A ball of
tension knotting in my
stomach, I put her over and
down. The plane shook
with thrust. Seconds, and
I could pick out the cruiser’s
A.A. batteries and the
men running to man
them. Lines of tracer
reached out, levelled, and
whipped past like blown
sparks. The plane was
shuddering with speed.
Came bomb-aimer’s voice:
“Left a little. More left.
Steady. Steady as you go.
Stand by!” Then the lift
with “Bombs away!”. With
barely time to right them-
selves the armor-capped
noses dug deep into the
cruiser’s vitals. With all
the force of both arms I hauled
back. The plane staggered, then
pulled up. As she lifted a burst of
shrapnel ripped into her belly with a
staccato rattle and—“ How long do I
have to rattle these plates in the sink?
Do I do all the work in this house?” I
went sadly in to make my report.

“X.S.”: Thieves who raided a jam
factory in Melbourne edged a one-and-a-
half cwt. safe by inches through the
building, 20yds. along the pavement
and then heaved it into a truck.
They returned to the factory for half-a-
ton -of bagged sugar with the obvious
intention of using it to deaden the sound
when they blew the safe open. The truck
refused to start, so they left the booty to
be found by the staff when they came on
duty in the morning. The safe held
books and happened to be unlocked. If
this had happened in Sydney the thieves
wouldn’t have worried about the safe.
That half-ton of sugar would have been

“Millswyn”: Who names terraces? I
don’t mean those rows of brick cottages
each bearing the name of an ocean liner,

“Bybren”: Familiarity allegedly breeds
contempt. I have known dairymen who
wouldn’t look at milk or cream; bakers
who wouldn’t eat pastry; and fish mer-
chants who look at a freshly-fried whiting
with the same cold and dispassionate eye
that a surgeon reserves for gangrene.
Brewers are apparently made of
sterner stuff. One who retired recently
after 10 years with an Adelaide firm
estimated that he had consumed about
25,000 bottles of beer. At current prices
this would cost about £2OOO, though it
didn’t cost him a penny, as his firm allows
employees a free quota of four pints a
day.

“Szechuan”: “Pitt St.’s” tale of the
beauteous lady with the rasping voice
(B, 3/ 3 / ’4B) reminds me of an experi-
ence in my first week in China. A pair
of immaculate Chinese were being ushered
to a table in a restaurant in Shanghai.
The female paused slightly by one of the
cuspidors, and, to use an equally ugly
word, expectorated in no pansy way.
Unlike the tram-passengers who groaned
at the beauty’s raucous voice, the diners
in the restaurant hardly seemed to notice
my goddess tumble from her pedes-
tal. *

“Macnell”: Parliamentary Secretary to
the British Navy, Mr. Dugdale, is opti-
mistic when, in defence of naval cuts,
he cites Australia’s .five-year naval pro-
gramme as taking some of the weight off
the R.N.’s shoulders, “Within five years
Australia hopes to have two light fleet-
carriers, three cruisers, eight destroyers
and 14,000 officers and men,” Sounds
all right until one remembers that a
battle-destroyer has been building in
Williamstown for over two years and is
still on the slips. Last time I saw her
work had stopped until shipwrights had
finished their scrap over who would lay
the foundation of a new slip alongside
her. H.M.A.S. Tobruk was launched
with great fanfare at Cockatoo, and has
not been touched for weeks because of
strikes. Recalling that at Savo Island
the Allies lost four heavy cruisers, Can-
berra among them, in one night; in the
Coral Sea action the Japs had two fleet-
carriers sunk and one badly damaged;
“All right; tell me how I get out!”
and that old War spite and her screen-
gunning up Narvik Fiord sank nine Ger-
man destroyers, Britain should not rely
overmuch on our five-year “fleet.”
* * * *
“Barrow”: Longshoremen’s tales about
pulling ships along singlehanded are true
enough. I remember as a schoolboy just
before the first ' war working during
school holidays at Vickers shipyard,
Barrow-in-Furness, on two submarines
well known to Australians —A.E.I and
A.E.2, My job was to help the markers-
off during working hours and to mark-off
as much mischief for myself as possible
during meal hours. On our last hectic
day, when fellow-mischief-seeker Billy
Peel urged me to help him pull the A.E.2
along the dockside, I laughed: “Don’t be
silly ; we’re not strong enough for that!”
Came the rejoinder “Don’t you be silly
—I saw a plater pulling it along on his
own this morning.” So we slipped the
ropes and found it as easy as falling off
a battleship. Unfortunately we got
A.E.2. fouled up with A.E.I. just as two
foremen came up. We left on the run
and, knowing we would be sacked, kept
on running. Subsequently both subs,
made the journey to Australia under their
own power. A.E.I. was lost near Rabaul
in September, 1914; A.E.2 served in the
Mediterranean, was the first sub, to pass
through the Dardanelles and was sunk in
the Sea of Marmora.

“Radian”: “Kelms’s” whisky trickster
(B. 17/3/’4B) revives subtle and filthy
smells that speak of Egypt. Abdul didn’t
bother about a wax partition ; he drilled
a small hole in the bottom of the bottle,
taking care not to disturb label or seals,
which were always those of leading
Scottish distillers. Genuine grog was
drained, any available concoction sub-
stituted and the hole sealed with cellulose
cement, which was very hard to detect
at a glance. Sales were usually made on
troop-trains which were just about to pull
out —it was much safer for the salesman
that way.
* * * *
“Huon”: Old files of Tasmanian news-
papers contain some choice reading.
Possibly because of the lack of local
news, vitriolic writing was a necessity of
trade. Two Launceston papers, one edited
by John Pascoe Fawkner and the other
by Samuel Bailey Dowsett, got to grips
at an early stage. Dowsett informed his
readers that Fawkner was “a moral pesti-
lence to be checked,” then changed the
metaphor by describing him as a “blow-
fly,” and added the epithets of “an addle-
pated upstart and a superannuated zany.”
Fawkner came back by remarking that
|f his rival “had his right place he would
be wearing a leather apron and scouring
pewter pots!” Then there was the occa-
sion* when the Cornwall “Chronicle,” re-
plying to the Launceston “Advertiser,”
spoke thus: —
We had determined never again to notice
the scurrility and unmeaning Billingsgate
of the low blackguards who, by strange
concatenation of circumstances, are placed
so prominently before the public in the
capacity of newspaper proprietors and re-
porters. We had resolved to submit to the
insolent interferences of the despicable and
senseless wretches, feeling persuaded we
could gain nothing by a collision with such
sweeps but sooted garments.
Well, now, where do we get literature
like that today in our daily paper?
WALKING-OUT.
“Mr. Chambers, Minister for the Army, has officially
approved a new ‘walking-out’ uniform navy blue
with scarlet stripes down each’ trouser-leg tor the
Commonwealth military forces.”
You croakers, never tired of criticising
Our Canberra Government for what, you say,
Is sinful tardiness in recognising
Another war may be upon the way,
Here’s something that should stop your belly-
aching . , .
And send your apprehensions up the spout.
One Minister at least no risks was taking,
Who set the military tailors making
A brand-new uniform for “walking-out.
A costly habit, such as old Polonius
Advised Laertes? That I couldn’t guess,
But doubtless with the richness'ceremonious
Shivoos demand, unmarred by gaudiness.
What scenes ’twill brighten up, what drab
concourses
In crowded city streets and thereabout
On gala days will glow with added sources
For healthy pride in military forces
Arrayed in uniforms for “walking-out”!
i
Let others call for soldiers to be learning
Their jobs, and airmen winging hither and
hence,
And argue with diffusiveness concerning
The measures needful for our land’s defence.
Such things as these, one may infer, are waiting
Their turn. Meanwhile ’twould be unfair to
flout
Our Army Minister for concentrating
Upon what’s also worth investigating,
The suitable attire for “walking-out.”
Ah, well, it’s settled now, and none will grudge
it,
The navy blue and scarlet, I suppose.
It’s not the clothes that make the man, I
judge it,
As surely as the man that makes the clothes.
And Chambers leaves us what will be con-
nected
For long with his regime, beyond a doubt;
Something, whatever he may have neglected,
To be sartorially recollected
When his own time arrives for “walking-out.”

There is no substitute for the protection
afforded by a contract with a sound
regular-bonus-paying life office. Public
recognition of this is reflected in the
growing volume of business now being
written by the big mutual and other offices.
Other factors which have helped the
figures along have been deferred demand
for cover from ex-service personnel, de-
preciation in the value of money,
popularity of group assurance in com-
mercial superannuation schemes, a buoy-
ant national income and high level of
employment and earnings.
Growth of the 78-year-old National
over the last decade is illustrated in the
following table:
1937. 1947.
Assurances in force .. £106,116,040 £168,417,649
Annual income .. 6,606,733 8,688,867
Total assets .. .. 44,540,109 68,888,529
Since 1937 the co. has thus put on over
half as much weight as it did during the
preceding 68 years. Moreover, it con-
tinues to exhibit satisfactory margins in
those matters upon which soundness and
progress depend. Income is gathered in
Australia, Maoriland, Britain, Ireland, S.
Africa and elsewhere, and includes no
industrial business.
New business written last term (up
£2,908,970) was over double the 1939
figure;
1989. 1946. 1947.
Policies .. 28,382 39,596 48,672
Amount ... £10,158,497 £20,468,143 £23,877,113
Annual premiums 363,755 802,421 988,905
Av. per.policy 358 517 480
Av. premium p.c. 3/11/7 3/18/5 4/0/3
On the usually accepted basis that new
business is 10 times more expensive than
old, last year’s new contracts —they came
mostly from Australia and Maoriland—
cost 66.3 p.c., as against 65.9 p.c. for the
previous term. That leaves out of the
reckoning licence fees, etc. (£17,190), con-
tributions to the staff fund (£12,026) and
allows 3 p.c. as consideration for annui-
ties. Owing to the large amount of new
business and rise in costs generally, total
exes, (including contributions to staff
fund, etc.) rose to 11.2 p.c. of total in-
come as against 10.6 p.c. for the previous
term —a common experience. They are
low ratios reflecting careful management.
The year’s growth in total income
(£8,533,867) was £647,789, of which
£571,607 came from premiums
(£6,271,303) and £76,182 from interest,
rents, etc. (£2,262,546). After paying all
legitimate claims and exes, and writing
£24,218 off the book value of fittings, etc.,
£3,505,005 (£806,659 more than in the
previous year) was added to the assur-
ance fund, making it £64,686,652. This
has the support and assistance of
£2,449,024 of other reserves, all of which
belongs to policyholders—there are no
shareholders. Bonuses were maintained
at the increased rates paid for the previ-
ous year.
The rate of interest earned dropped
slightly. Gross return on the mean assur-
ance fund was £4 2s. sd. p.c. (down Is.
p.c.) and the net return, after deducting
taxes, was £3 13s. 3d. p.c. (down lid.
p.c.). The down-trend of interest earn-
ings—likely to continue for a while
—is the result of the Government’s cheap-
money policy. To protect future bonus-
paying capacity the co. lowered its basis
of valuing policy liabilities from 3 p.c.
to 2\ p.c. in 1940. The cost was £515,000,
met out of the surplus for the period.
Actuarial and other reserves have been
strengthened substantially since. Still it
is doubtful whether any marked increase
in bonus rates need be looked for, for a
while, at any rate.
Here is a condensation of the invest-
ment portfolio:

Public securities (up £2,971,489) include
a lot of Commonwealth 3| p.c. paper.
Which three years to run to
first (optional) maturity date. Present
rate on Federal new loans and conversions
is 3i p.c. Hence the attention now being
given to industrial and other securities
which show a better net return. When
the books closed £674,859 (up £357,317)
was invested in pref. and ord. shares.
Although mortgages were reduced by
£214,631 net, about £1,500,000 was
advanced in house-purchase loans during
the year, and the co. had £2,380,000 in-
vested (shares and deposits) in the Fourth
Victoria Building Society.

This co. specialises in medium-priced
drapery goods, and the store, facing King-
and Gebrge-streets, is at one of thei
busiest intersections in the city. Last
term’s net earnings (up £11,408) were
the best since the co. took over from
McDowell and Hughes, Ltd., in 1920.
Chief factor responsible for the improve-
ment was continued expansion of turn-
over, mainspring of which was a better
flow of goods and free spending. The
public’s pockets were well lined, thanks
to a buoyant national income and what
virtually amounts to “over-full” employ-
ment at high and rising wage rates. The
management also has a reputation for
shrewd buying and careful budgeting,
which means, among other things, a tight
hold upon controllable outgoings.
Turnover (amount not stated) was a
record. How retailers generally have
fared in this connection the following
table illustrates —it shows percentage
changes in aggregate sales of 22 Sydney
stores compared with the corresponding
period of the previous year:

Sales for 1946-47 were over 91 p.c. above
the 1938-39 level, due partly to the rise
in prices, which are still on the up-grade.
Despite the growth in costs, expanding
turnover enabled the co, to operate on
smaller gross margins and still show an
improved net result. The spring in gross
earnings (£516,996) was £74,321. Includ-
ing provision for depreciation (£4200)
and taxation (£75,000) at same rates as
for the previous year; exes. (£429,260)
took £62,913 of the gain. Thus the net
result reached £87,736, or enough to pay
the small pref. div, (£800) and show 29.7
p.c. on the £292,726 of ord. capital, com-
pared with 25.8, 17.4, 19.9, 16, 14.7 and
13.8 p.c. back to 1942. The distribution
was kept at 15 p.c.—s p.c. of it is labelled
bonus—making an average of 13.7 p.c.
over the last decade compared with
10.7 p.c. for the 10 years before that.
No account has been taken of profit
earned by W. T. Waters and Co. Pty., the
subsidiary cash-order concern in which
the parent has £136,897 invested —£90,903
shares and £45,994 advances. And when
the books closed reserves were heaped
£29,936 higher than paid capital, which
also helps to explain the high rate of
earning on capital alone.
Here are balance-sheet figures:
1940. 1946. 1947. 1948.

Investments, largely Government securi-
ties, previously included with freeholds,
etc. (down £119,798) are now shown
separately at £57,237. Stocks (up
£123,642) catch the eye ; but in these days
of rising prices, scarcities and delays in
delivery they look more like a hedge
than a risk. The year’s improvement in
the more or less liquid surplus (£262,972)
was £162,827, of which £57,237 was due
to disclosure of investments already men-
tioned.

terfered with. Net tangible cover (book

This co. and its subsidiaries —the group
is the biggest thing of its kind in Aus-
tralasia —own large freehold and lease-
hold timber stands in Maoriland, Wes-
tralia and the Solomon Islands ; and there
are mills in all these areas and in Tas-
mania. Also, there are drying kilns and
box-making and plywood plants at Mel-
bourne and Brisbane.
Expansion of activities was more
marked than movement in last term’s
profit figure alone suggests. During the
last half of the year the old and well-
established Adelaide business of Globe
Timber Mills, Ltd. (paid capital £78,000)
was welded into the organisation. The
price wasn’t mentioned, but the parent’s
unlisted shareholdings increased by
£168,525. To help finance the deal, carry
additional stocks, acquire sea-going vessels
for the movement of timber, erect new
joinery works and further mechanise
forestry work, thus quickening and cheap-
ening production in the logging section of
the business, the parent offered £400,000
of 4 p.c. debentures at end March, 1947.
The issue, which was heavily oversub-
scribed, is repayable at par at end August,
1967, and the co., which is to establish a
sinking fund of £BOOO p.a., has, the right
to redeem in part or full after August,
1962.
More overseas timber and plywood
logs came in last term, but trading results
were affected by the low price of Tas-
manian hardwood and rising costs.
Operations in Tasmania resulted in a loss
of £28,380. After allowing £29,133 for
taxation and £38,797 (up £8186) for de-
preciation—included with profits and then
shown as Written off in the table —and
paying interest (£6667) and flotation exes.
(£5126) on the debenture issue, the net
result from all sources was £7313 lighter
at £38,642, of which £12,289 (down
£3695) came from the parent’s own trad-
ing, £23,494 (down £3849) from sub-
sidiaries and £2860 (up £231) from general
investments. The £38,643 was 5.1 p.c. on
capital as against 6.1, 5.1, 5,5, 5.2, 6.2
and 6.3 p.c. back to 1940. The div. was
kept at 5 p.c., making the average 5.4 p.c.
over the last 13 years. On shareholders’
funds (capital and reserves combined) the
year’s net result was 4 p.c. The deben-
ture money hasn’t yet had a chance to
show what it can do in the way of earn-
ings.
Combined balance-sheet figures of
parent and subsidiaries, including the
newly-acquired Globe Mills, show that
the debenture money, plus an extra
£270,721 from sundry creditors, went
mostly into stocks (up £379,178) book
debts (up £93,828), plant (up £71,197) and
properties (up £22,319);

Owing to the lag in home and other
building, the outlook on the demand side
is one of steady pressure for years to
come. As soon as regular shipping is
available, timber from Vanikoro, shut off
since war began, will help to swell sup-
plies again. Mounting costs are the bug-
bear. Introduction of the 40-hour week
and shortage of labor, which mean a
heavy bill for overtime, are expected to

A NEW DEVELOPMENT
Spreader Firing, combined with a
Forward Moving Grate
The introduction of the
Forzmrd Moving Grate,
discharging ash continu-
ously, has widened the scope
of Spreader Firing because:
1. Combustion conditions
are not disturbed by inter-
mittent ash removal.
2. There is no clinker for-
mation, even with ash
having very low fusion tem-
perature, as the bulk of the
air required for combustion
passes through and cools
the ash layer, thereby
avoiding harmful deposits
on the pressure parts.
3. Automatic control is
simply applied.
4. High burning rates are
readily attained, as the fuel
and the air are evenly dis-
tributed ovet every square
foot of grate area.

Norseman Gold, NX. (paid
capital £125,000 in ss. shares),
operating at Norseman (W.A.),
recorded a profit of £8567 for
the year to end Oct., 1947, as
against a loss of £25,032 for the
previous term. The profit was
6.8 p.c. on capital, and it in-
cluded £25,000 Federal subsidy
and was written after charging
£25,819 for development, etc.,
and £12,098 for depreciation.
Cessation of unprofitable gold
production at the Norseman, a
lift in‘the price of pyritic con-
centrates and increased output
did the trick —76,371 tons ore
were treated for 32,808 tons
concentrates, assaying 46.6 p.c,
sulphur. Including 8415 tons
high-grade ore railed direct,
production realised £212,892, or
555, 6d. per ton ore. Extraction
and treatment costs were 275.
7yd. a ton, Development has
disclosed a large body of pyritic
ore in the Iron King, lifting re-
serves to 700,000 tons (up
357,000 tons) at end Oct,, 1947,
Owing to low values (about
2.64dwt.), small quantity of ore
available (some 10,000 tons) and
rising costs, stoping of auri-
ferous ore in the Norseman
ceased in Feb., 1947, Since the
ore-body being worked here
doesn’t appear to, persist below
No. 9 level, prospects depend
upon location of another shoot
of pay-ore in the Mararoa reef.
The market prices the co.’s scrip
at 2s. 9d.

have made a good start. Rich
specimen ore is officially stated
to have been broken in the drive
on the 420 ft. level, and “abun-
dant gold” is said to be visible
in the face. A cheque for
£127,500, balance of the pur-
chase consideration of £132,500,
has been handed to the vendor
Day Dawn syndicate. A larger
amount was once handed over by
Chafles Kaufman, representing
a London Corporation, for the
once-big Kalgoorlie producer
Ivanhoe, now included in the
Lake View and Star group.
Mountain View has a paid capi-
tal of £150,000 in 750,000 f.-p.

“O.B.”: According to recent
press cables stone from a Johan-

more than lOdwt. gold a ton.
The cable added that at the turn
of last century many street-gut-

structed of rock from the mines.
Kalgoorlie (W.A.) can beat this.
In the early days many miners’
humpies, on and adjacent to the
Golden Mile mines, had chim-
neys built of telluride ore. When
their value became known they
were soon pulled down and
treated, for a return of ounces to
the ton in some cases. The
foundations of a dismantled
brewery there were also milled
for a gooj! return.

Politics and Production
Mr. Chifley, at the Easter con-
ference of the Victorian A.L.P.,
appealed for greater production
from trade-unionists, adding:
“By going slow some people
think they are cheating the boss,
the Government or even me, but
the only people they cheat are
their fellow-citizens, the neigh-
bors in their street.” All very
true, but a truth stubbornly and
almost wantonly denied by Mr.
Chifley during the critical years
of Labor’s demoralisation in
Australia. The most important
aspect of the Prime Minister’s
belated admission is that his con-
ceding the fact at all indicates
how very serious the position has
become.
Mr. Chifley is full of deathbed
repentance now, or professes to
be. He admits that Labor’s pro-
duction machine is letting the
country down ; he says he ab-
hors the principles of Commun-
ism ; he speaks with apparent
concern about the economic
position of “the United King-
dom” and “the British people.”
Yes, he is mouthing a lot of ap-
propriate words, as well as an
abundance of less appropriate
ones, but he is doing his usual
nothing about the crisis in our
midst. And yet he is all to the
fore when asking for the trans-
fer of State powers to the Com-
monwealth, and when taking
unto his Government a
monopoly of trading-bank ac-
tivities, Mr. Chifley still aims to
“control” private enterprise,
especially the management side
of it, but he is utterly scared to
deal with industrial anarchy and
Communism, the real problems
in Australia today.' •
Mr. Clarey, president of the
A.C.T.U., backed up the Chifley
request for greater production,
but again he repudiated any
notion of his sanctioning the in-
troduction of incentive - pay-
ments. Mr. Clarey has stood in
the way of incentive-payments
for greater production per man
per hour during all attempts at
negotiation with the trade-
unions. At a meeting called by
the Institute of Industrial
Management in Melbourne on
December 4, 1946, Mr. Clarey
said that the incentive system
was incapable of “reform” to
the satisfaction of “Labor,” and
counter-offered, as his cure-all
for industrial troubles, the sug-
gestion that the “workers”
should be given “a greater share
of the national income” and be
allowed “a greater share of
leisure”! Since then there have
been (a) a “prosperity” loading to
the basic wage, and ( b ) a reduc-
tion in working hours from 44
to 40 a week. The consequent
production situation has never
been worse, and never have the
workers had higher money wages
or more “leisure” - more
“leisure” even after “working”
hours'.
It is interesting at this junc-
ture also to consider the judg-
ment of the Full Federal Arbi-
tration Court, as presented by
Judge Foster on Sept. 8, 1947, by
which the 40-hour week became
law throughout the Common-
wealth from the beginning of
this year. Among the reasons
for the Court’s order were:
AH criteria of an active, virile, pro-
gressive economy are present today.
Our population has increased and all
are working... .There are, of course,
the depressive factors of industrial
unrest, disorganisation and reduced
output which seem to follow war and
periods of readjustment, but these,
though bad enough, are not abnor-
mally so. They show signs of some
abatement.
It seems clear to us, as it seemed
to this Court when it dealt with this
problem before in 1926, so clear as
to be beyond any cavil, that the
“A couple of gallons, Abdul”
appropriate time to add burdens to
industry or, from another angle, to
give ourselves added benefits, is when
industry is booming and nature is
bountiful. All economists on both
sides agree that never in our history
have all the factors been so favorable,
nor is it easy to conceive them ever
being more favorable.
The Court commented upon
laxity among managements and
workers resulting from “war-
time conditions,” “Easy profits
and such factors greatly affected
factory discipline for which
management is responsible.”
The Court did not at this point
mention the effect of high taxa-
tion on the outlook of manage-
ments, or the industrial indisci-
pline that was prompted at all
times by Communists and the
militant trade-union movement
and tacitly encouraged by the
Canberra Ministry.
Indeed, the Court seemed to
overlook many of the funda-
mentals of the production de-
pression in which we live today,
and to accept the paper-money
prosperity of the times as being
the real thing.
In the concluding part of the
judgment it was* said:
We have had all the assistance with
which the best minds could provide
us. For the use we make of it, ours
is the responsibility, and it is trite
to admit that we feel it very heavily.
One comfort, however, remains; that
is, if experience shows that we have
erred, and, contrary to our best judg-
ment, the economy does suffer, or,
if because of unforeseen world con-
ditions unanticipated results threaten
us, then the Court can take such
necessary steps as will best protect
and preserve our community against
any such untoward possibilities.
The need for protection and
preservation would appear to be
only a short way off, judging by
the concern now being revealed
even by Mr. Chifley and some
trade-union leaders.
The facts are that things are
bad on the production front. We
are producing steel—a basic,
essential commodity for housing
and a thousand other purposes
—at a lower rate than during
the war, and coal output is down
also. This is an opposite posi-
tion to what is happening in the
United States, though Australia
suffered little more war damage
than America, even if the eco-
nomic impact of war was pro-
portionately greater here. In
the United States piecework
and incentive - payments are
common.
On Australian wharves the
loading and unloading rate is
scandalous —there is no other
word for it. Patches of the
economy are in better shape, but
essential production and trans-
port industries have been selected
by industrial disruptionists
flourishing the banner of
“Labor” or Communism for
a kind of treatment calcu-
lated to delay and damage
the whole production machine.
Lack of “employer discipline”
has little to do with this state
of affairs, especially as, each
day, the employer’s right to hire
and fire has become more and
more subject to organised trade-
union retaliation and official
disapproval.
Operation of the Marshall
Plan has “lengthened the infla-
tion horizon,” according to
A. G. Hart, of Columbia Uni-
versity. And, in spite of the
higher wheat yield and other
prospects of greater production,
with the United States’ foreign
responsibilities' stretching so far
ahead “it no longer looks safe
to rely on a spontaneous relaxa-
tion of inflation pressure to make
anti-inflation policy unneces-
sary.” And a Presidential-elec-
tion year is not likely to produce
much in the way of a Govern-
mental deflation programme,
even though President Truman
has just stated that “inflation is
getting steadily worse” in the
U.S.A.

The special tax on property

LONDON AIRMAIL
From Herbert Holman
High Wind
Britons are always astonished
when bad weather doesn’t spoil
a public holiday. Easter, except
in the hours of homecoming,
was bright, sunny and inviting.
It was essentially an out-of-
doors Easter and valued the
more on that account.
Although the sun was hot a
high cool wind persisted. With a
fast-running tide as ally it helped
Cambridge, after a bad start, to
break a boat-race record. It
kept people on the move, causing
them to be wary of sitting about;
and it punished those who dared
prematurely to cast their clouts.
In post-war Britain the older
festivals, particularly Christmas
and Easter, seem to fall short of
fulfilment. Participation in them
is hampered not by any reluct-
ance to take part, but by the
pressure of outside events. It is
hard to express peace and good-
will when much of the outside
world denies their existence.
During Easter present-day
austerity brought home to the
Englishman the home-truth that
old customs could be honored
only in the memory. He was an
unusually lucky man who could
wear “something new” on
Easter Day, especially if the
garment were anything more
considerable (than a pullover or
a pair of socks. And the ideas
of release and rebirth associated
with Easter and the spring
served only to remind him that
what is now being released and
reborn in Central Europe is not
for his wellbeing.
Church attendances were re-
markably large this latest Easter
Sunday.
Better Conditions
Setting aside the disappoint-
ment and gloom that come from
reading the headlines in the
newspapers, Britons have been
encouraged by a slight but
marked improvement in living
conditions.
Nothing cheers so much as the
knowledge of this or that con-
trol being removed. Bread
rationing has never been ac-
cepted with a good grace. The
cutting-out of the coupons was
at first conscientiously practised
in bakers’ shops, but, with more
plentiful supplies, assistants be-
came smilingly “forgetful” to-
wards all except strangers. The
reason for the intense dislike of
bread rationing goes deeper than
mere shortage; it is a harsh re-
minder that, in some ways, post-
war conditions have proved to
be worse than in the war years,
when it never became necessary
to ration bread or cakes. There
are indications that the system
may soon be withdrawn.
Because of the great size of
his county, the Londoner’s food
probleins are more acute than
those of provincial people. Dis-
tribution difficulties have meant
an uncomfortable shortage of
milk in London. The housewife
(unless she has priority) has had
to manage with a mere two pints
a week per head; and this for
the breakfast cereal, cooking and
beverages. Supplies are now
nearly doubled. The tonic effect
is so bracing that it seems as if
a farm is just round the corner.
Other relaxations which point
to a more comfortable life are
the lifting of foreign travel re-
strictions to eight more coun-
tries, a promise of the resump-
tion of basic petrol allowances
on a modest scale in midsum-
mer, and the extension of
broadcasting until midnight in
the Light and Third Pro-
grammes. This last restriction,
imposed at the time of the fuel
cuts, had rather implied a Gov-
ernmental hint that all citizens
should be in bed by 11 o’clock !
Food and Trade
On March 17 Mr. Strachey,
Minister for Food, told press-
men that import figures showed
that “the non-dollar world is
beginning to recover in the nick
of time for us.” In the dollar
area Britain today buys foods
only from Canada, and the
quantity is only 25 per cent, of
total purchases. In 1947 nearly
half of Britain’s imported food
came from dollar countries.
Since August, 1947, no food has
been brought in from the
United States. The trade-agree-
ment with the Argentine pro-
vides for payment in sterling.
From Canada Britain buys, for
dollars, three-quarters of its im-
ported wheat and bacon, most of
its imported cheese, and some
eggs and meat. But it is not in-
tended to cut off Canadian food
supplies entirely, regardless of
what recovery takes place in the
“non-dollar world.”
British coal exports have
risen from 64,000 tons last
November to 334,000 tons in
February, Exports of every-
thing during February repre-
sented the highest daily-value
rate since 1920. Nearly 15,000
new motor-cars were exported
in each of the first two months
of 1948: Britain is now selling
1000 cars a month to the United
States. In Portugal, British cars
from eight to 12 horsepower are
selling at from 35,000 to 48,000
escudos, compared with 66,500
escudos for an American Chev-
rolet, It i§ hoped that Australia
will buy 50,000 British cars in
1948, compared with 19,000 in
1947.
Communists
Nobody is normally readier to
live and let live than the
Englishman. His upheavals
during the past nine years make
him the more eager to get on
with the job of earning a living
and enjoying his leisure in his
own way.
The years of exile of the ser-
viceman and the disturbed exist-
ence of the battle-scarred civilian
were greatly sustained by the
thoughts of settling down again
to a simple, quiet life. Each has
found out, too painfully, that
daily life is often more un-
settled than it was during the
war years. The result is deep
frustration and resigned disap-
pointment. The question asked
is: “What is holding us up?”
The answer inevitably rests on
the actions of the men who con-
trol Soviet Russia.
In Britain, Communism has
not been taken seriously by the
nation in general. In fact, the
ordinary person rarely sees a
Communist. In Hyde Park, at
street-corners, or outside under-
ground stations he may perhaps
have seen pale young men or in-
tense-looking women gesticulat-
ing from soap-boxes or implor-
ing passers-by to take; away a
copy of their party’s newspaper.
When there is trouble from
strikes or from “squatting” he
learns that Communists were be-
lieved to be behind the agita-
tion.
He knows that admitted
members of the Communist
party are few—about 1 per 1000
of the population—and hold
only two seats in the House of
Commons. That they can hope
for little support is plain from
the results of the municipal
elections in November, 1947,
when not one of the 194 Com-
munist candidates was returned ;
and in the recent by-election at
Wigan—a “miner’s seat” for 30
years—the Communist lost his
deposit.
They would seem, on the face
of it, to be fighting a vain cause.
But since the seizing of the
machinery of government in
Czechoslovakia responsible
British citizens have been com-
pelled to ask themselves serious
questions. The fact that it hap-
pened surprised them less than
the way in which it was done ;
and they were dismayed at the
impotence of the resistance.
People began to wonder if it
could possibly happen here. It
certainly couldn’t at present.
But what of the future? Is
everything being done to put the
house in order?
Reaction to the Prime Minis-
ter’s announcement that Com-
munists would be transferred
from certain positions in the
civil service was therefore one
of immediate relief, tempered
with some misgiving.
The people affected are
Communists or Fascists who are
in the Service of the Crown (to
which any elected Government
owes allegiance), A civil servant
who might have to choose be-
tween the betrayal of his country
and the betrayal of his own con-
victions is not considered a fit
person to have access to State
secrets.

SUNDRY SHOWS
Hinton Exhibition.
The N. S. Wales National
Gallery is honoring the memory
of Howard Hinton with an ex-
hibition of most of the pictures
he donated to the Gallery in his
lifetime, with the addition of the
pictures—his personal favorites
—which were his bequest to
Armidale Teachers’ College.
These last have a special in-
terest, and include some fine
Streetons —“Sirius Cove,” “Bal-
moral,” “Summer Noon,”
“Canal Scene, Venice”
Gruner’s “Rotorua” and the
Norman Lindsay watercolors
“Belshazzar,” “Guarded,” “Hy-
drangea,” “Happiness,” a Hans
Heysen watercolor, the water-
color “The Showerbath” by R,
T. Kuhn, the oil “Sister Rigo-
letta” by Jan Van Beers, the oil
“La Danseuse” by Jean Beraud,
“Foley’s Bay” by J. J. Hilder, a
pen-drawing by Adrian Flint and
five pen-drawings by Norman
Lindsay. There is also a por-
trait by an unknown British
artist, done in the manner of
Lawrence.
“Sirius Cove,” painted in
1892, is Streeton at his best; a
fine composition of blue water,
rocks and summer sky, specially
interesting for Streeton’s treat-
ment of the trees —a kind of
loving indulgence in green—
which is characteristic of some
of his early work.
The Norman Lindsay water-
colors “Hydrangea” and “Hap-
piness,” although painted in
1934 and 1933, properly belong
to this artist’s “Blue Hat”
period {circa 1938). Both have
the blazing, yet pure, quality of
light, flowers and lawns; pea-
cock in one, and in both the
human form enthroned in this
background, “Belshazzar,” dated
1932, has the strength of an oil,
and is a brilliant, rich, massed
piece of work; “Guarded”
(1933) is the equally well-known
painting of two female nudes
posed on a rock with a coiled
dragon at the foot of it, the
group surrounded by a wash
combining an aqueous lumin-
osity with starry brilliance. The
focal point of the picture is the
white curved figure in the centre.
The Gruner painting, “Roto-
rua,” is dated 1931, and is a
rich, green, restrained painting
similar to his “Pines” in tone
but not in intensity. Hilder’s
“Foley’s Bay” is one of this
artist’s very few oils. It is a
small picture of massed gold
toning into gold and green
water-lights.
In the exhibition proper there
are other Norman Lindsays,
Gruners, a whole wall of Hil-
ders, Lamberts, a Frank Heath,
Fred Whiting’s “The Hunts-
man,” a David Cox landscape,
an etching by Augustus John, a
pencil sketch by Orpen, Julius
Olssen, Phil May, Lionel Lind-
say, j. G. Plazer, E. Phillips
Fox, Penleigh Boyd, Mahony,
Douglas Fry, A. Jablczynska
and Nora Heysen.
A number of pictures donated
by Hinton to the Gallery are now
on loan to Government depart-
ments and to Australian lega-
tions overseas. The loan of pic-
tures td Government offices in
Sydney is not, perhaps, so very
serious. Most of them will be
back in time to be seen at the
Gallery. But it is a pity that two
fine Gruners, “New England”
and “Milking Time,’’ are hang-
ing in the Australian Legation,
Washington. However desirable
it may be to advertise Australia
with the best of Australian art,
the loan seems contrary to the
spirit of the donations. And if
the Government really wishes to
surround diplomats with fine
paintings it might, perhaps, buy
them.
But Gruner is well represented
in the exhibition with one of his
“frosty-light” masterpieces and
“The Pines.” “Frosty Sunrise,”
with two horses and a man walk-
ing down a hill into the picture,
distant figures of cattle, lines of
land and building breaking into
the light and long shadows in
the foreground, belongs to the
finest expression of Gruner’s
art. So does “The Pines,” with
the avenue of trees leading to a
house and a wall, a smooth car-
pet of green in the foreground
and above the house light deep-
ening into deep blue with the
illimitable quality which was
Gruner’s special magic. The
pines themselves have mystery,
darkness and growth in them.
Douglas. Fry’s head of a fox
terrier deserves special mention
—it was the first picture Hinton
gave to the Gallery-—and both
Pierre Gerber’s “Head of a Pea-
sant Girl” and Fred Whiting’s
“The Huntsman” are remarkable
for different reasons —Gerber’s
for capture of character and
Whiting’s for the evocation, by
the simple blend of deep, rich,
green turf, a grey horse and the
red coat of a huntsman, of the
soft richness of the English
countryside and the drama of
horseflesh and hunting.
J. Van der Capelle’s “Marine
with Vessels” again belongs to
a special category. It shows
boats tied to a wharf, a sailing-
ship and an ancient, smoky-gold
coloring. It was painted in the
17th century.
But the total effect of the ex-
hibition lies in the Norman
Lindsays, Streetons, Gruners and
Hilders. One wonders how the
Gallery would have managed
had there been no Hinton to
make these considerable dona-
tions, and, even considering the
many valuable pictures in the
Gallery’s possession, how poor
it would be if the Hinton dona-
tions were subtracted from its
total of Australian art.
Erna Berger.
The coloratura from the Ber-
lin State Opera plunged straight
in off the deep end at her first
Sydney recital with Mozart’s
“Exsultate, Jubilate.” In this
beautiful motet the 17-year-old
composer exploited to the full
his unsurpassed knowledge of
the human voice which stemmed
from his own studies in London
under Manzuoli, The tremen-
dous difficulties' with which its
pages are studded were made
less apparent by the ease with
which the soprano overcame
them in singing that was limpid
and serene in the legato passages
and, in the, concluding Alleluia,
charged with an admirably-dis-
ciplined vitality.
Turning to lieder, five of
Schubert’s best-loved songs were
given loving treatment. In
“Hedge Rose” the repeated as-
cending “roslein” was an ex-
ample of the perfect half-voice.
In “Du bist die Ruh” there were
lovely shadings of tone, becom-
ing deeper as the song pro-
gressed ; “Ave Maria,” one of
the greatest tests of breathing
and of legato singing in all vocal
literature, was given with great
devotional feeling. Through
“Faith in Spring” and “The
Trout” threaded a joy and a Jilt.
Behind all these and a fine
Brahms, group shone the bright-
ness of a highly - intelligent
musicianship.
The soprano then demon-
strated that, divorced from the
vulgar ostentation with which
too many coloraturas invest
Verdi, such an aria as “Caro
Nome” can be lifted to the
highest plane of refinement. Miss
Berger made of it the rhapsodi-
cal utterance it should be. “E
Strano,” from “Traviata,” was
one of the most brilliant ex-
amples of true coloratura heard
here for many a day.
The second recital was a
veritable feast of Schumann and
Grieg, with the “Lotus Flower”
and “Solveig’s Song” as the
highlights. A dewy freshness
combined with an infectious
gaiety to make the Laughing
Song from Strauss’s “Fleder-
maus” and “Voices of Spring”
memorable. The final concert,
a potpourri of Handel, Wolf,
and some rarely-heard Weber,
Schubert and Mozart, was a
most exacting test, throughout
which the singer preserved dead-
centre notes, soaring lyricism,
superfine control and a facile
ability to run the emotional
gamut.
Eileen Joyce.
Every seat has been filled at
Eileen Joyce’s Melbourne con-
certs. In fact, one pair of
seats had two pairs of cus-
tomers on Tuesday night,
and The Bulletin man found
himself adrift like the Flying
Dutchman in a sea of hostile
faces with no port to go to,
finally crawling up and effacing
himself on a remote step on the
Himalayas at the extreme back
of the Town Hall balcony.
This, however, turned out to
be an advantage. It was not
only possible to test the surpris-
ing variety of the Town Hall’s
acoustics, but also to see Miss
Joyce from almost eVery angle—
a back-view of the red dress
which gives her the inspiration
for the “Moonlight Sonata,” a
side-view of her amazing fingers
flying through the “Papillons”
of Schumann with all the flut-
tering lightness of those insects,
a front-view of her limpid per-
formance of Ravel’s “Jeux
d’eau,” and a bird’s-eye view of
the white costume she regards as
appropriate to Chopin.
Lucidity and exactness are
the chief qualities of Miss
Joyce’s playing. It is doubtful
if she dropped her fingers on to
one note too late, too soon, too
hard or too softly, throughout
the evening. This perfection of
technique, indicating a terrifying
amount of practice and concen-
tration, tended to produce a cer-
tain hardness in the Schumann,
and in the exquisite Chopin
panel made one item seem much
like another, but it led to a
staggering effect in the B Flat
Minor Scherzo. The finale of
the Beethoven sonata lacked
richness, but the cantabile of
the adagio movement was lovely.


Women's Letters
From Sydney
Monday, April 4, 1949, will be the day.
On that autumn morning the King and
Queen, with Princess Margaret, will arrive
in Sydney. The Royal visitors will travel
in H.M.S. Vanguard, and after a day in
Sydney will fly to Canberra. On Friday,
April 8, they will return and spend about
13 days in this State. The whole of Aus-
tralia is preparing to welcome its
Sovereign, the Queen and the Princess,
and the whole of this city promises to
look as gay as a ribbon-decked maypole
during the visit.
Sydney High was headliner all right in
the G.P.S. regatta last Saturday. It won
the Head of the River Eights and three
of the fours. Shore, however, got home
first in the fourth fours. Everything was
right for the regatta but the weather. The
sky was grey and there was a deluge of
rain just as the eights started. Cars be-
decked with the colors of the various
G.P.S. carried along the road to Penrith
loads of schoolgirls and -boys complete
with streamers and megaphones. The
noise of barracking and cheers, and chants
that sounded almost like battle-cries,
seemed as long and loud as of old, but
officials say the crowds lining the Nepean
were thousands fewer than last year.
Officialdom and headmasters, their
wives, and groups of their guests watched
and cheered from the grounds of Raven-
spur, the home of Mr. and Mrs. M. C.
Jones. The Log Cabin provided another
grandstand view of the races. In the
evening the day’s fun was rounded off by
dances —the city was ringed with them
from Rose Bay to Neutral Bay. There
was a regatta dance, too, at the Lap-
stone Hotel.
Sydney society had a juicy morsel
thrown to it last week. The arrival of
Lord and Lady Mountevans —and don’t
forget he was in qommand of the Aus-
tralian Navy as Rear-Admiral Evans
from 1929-31—gave hostesses a gilt-
edged reason for hospitality. The Mount*
evans couple arrived in the Norwegian
motorship Torrens and spread a very
happy lunch-party in her for Sydney
friends last Wednesday. Among old
friends with whom they linked up were
the Fred McMasters, of Cassilis, and the
Niels Storakers. The' Storakers gave an
outsize in cocktail-parties in their honor
last Friday, at the Royal Sydney Golf
Club. People who like to recall the deeds
of brave men will remember that Lord
Mountevans has also the proud title of
“Evans of the Broke.”
One of Killara’s pretty girls, Margaret
Fyvie-Watt, became the bride of Arthur
MacKinnon, of Conara, Tasmania, on
the coldest day of last week. In spite of
a wind blowing straight off the snow of
Kosciusko, Margaret bloomed in her
flowing white frock with its rounded neck-
line, and a froth of tulle veiling over
which was worn a veil of Honiton-lace,
heirloom of the ’groom’s family. Eliza-
beth Raine, Diana Harvey Sutton and
Mrs. T. R. Bowling attended Margaret.
Captain Alistair Cameron came from
Tasmania to stand by the ’groom. Recep-
tion in the Royal Sydney Golf Club fol-
lowed, bride’s parents, Mr. and Mrs. L.
Fyvie-Watt, welcoming a great gathering
of friends.
Erna Berger, in a frock of the most
heavenly shade of blue, and graceful of
design except for an overplus of bows,
sang for an appreciative Town Hall
audience during last •. week pro-
grammes that included Mozart, Schu-
bert, Verdi, in fact all the com-
posers who have written for the colora-
tura voice. Erna comes on to the plat-
form without any grand-artist airs, and
receives her applause with the smile of
delighted surprise. Her manner of curt-
sying, too, can be recommended to the
attention of budding singers. Mozart’s
“Exsultate Jubilate” and Schubert’s “Ave
Maria” were starry numbers.
It is 33 years since the first dawning
of Anzac, and once again the noble anni-
versary draws near. It is good then to
remember what the men of the First
World War suffered in the cause of Free-
dom, and how their sons and grandsons'
in World War II carried on the heroic
tradition. On Anzac Day, 1948, you can
help the soldiers of both wars who still
carry the scars of suffering, and help
to make life a little easier for their depen-
dants, by buying a tin-hat, a miniature
of the hat worn by the soldier on active-
service. Proceeds of all sales go to the
various organisations working for the
welfare of the ex-serviceman.
Guests went prancing up the stairs to
the Ballet Club last Wednesday feeling
like understudies to the Rambert Com-
pany, They emerged a couple of hours
later to find the night whipped with sleet-
like rain and a wind that threatened to
cut the nylons into shreds. Then Ballet
poise crashed, and people scuttled into
taxi and car and tram, just like home-
going suburbanites trying not to get wet.
But the party was pretty bright. Reason
for it was the handing-over of a portrait
of patron knight Ben Fuller. This had
been painted by Miriam Macrae, and will
duly hang in the foyer of the Princess
Theatre in Melbourne. Its first night of
occupancy will coincide with the opening
of the Old Vic. Company.
With the Benjamin were
Judge Rainbow and a group of
friends in which were the Maurice Gul-
sons —Mrs. Gulson’s frock of deep-red
rose velvet set off with some eye-blinking
costume jewellery—-Colonel Meredith and
Mrs. Meredith, composer Albert Arlen,
Mrs. Herman, from Perth, and Mrs.
Florence Taylor. Club’s president Vera
Lacey introduced Aubrey Halloran, who
plucked off the black and gold Chinese
shawl from the picture, and revealed a
very good likeness of the theatre knight.
The Journalists Club had Helen Keller
as guest-of-honor at a recent lunch.
“The Spoken Word” was the sub-
ject of Helen’s discourse. She was
presented with a portrait of herself by
artist Stan Clements. The Australian
Book Society struck a star speaker also
in Colin Simpson, feature producer for
the A.B.C. The Derwent Valley, New
Norfolk, Mt. Lyell, Broken Hill came into
his talk. It was like being given a whirl
around Australia.
A pleasant date ahead for Mrs. Speight,
wife of Dr. R. J. J. Speight, of Annandale,
is May 12. On that night the ex-students
of St. Vincent’s College will hold their
annual ball, of which Mrs. Speight is
president. The college colors, pale-blue
and white, will be dominant among the
decorations of Rose’s, where the ball will
be held. Between 300 and 400 dancers
are expected, and there is a prize—a Very
dainty and demure cocktail hat—for the
frock judged by actress Muriel Steinbeck
to be the most effective. The Convent
Building Fund will benefit. Norton

All musical Sydney knows Lute Drum-
mond. Lute, who settled in this her native
land after being many years in Germany,
Italy and France studying languages and
music, had for a long time a penthouse
studio above Bond-street in this city.
Here she not only gave lessons in singing
to her pupils, but poured into them the
treasures of knowledge her quick and
sensitive mind had gleaned from the stores
of foreign lands. Among her pupils were
Kenneth Neate, now singing leading tenor
parts at Covent Garden —Ken mentioned
Lute in his broadcast interview with Dick
Bentley last week —and Joan Hammond.
Country friends coming to town for
the Sheep Show will have something to
think about besides the ram sales on the
night of June 5. On that night the whole
of Romano’s will be given over to the
Peter Pan Wool Ball. This is being or-
ganised by Mrs. Marcel Dekyvere and
on her committee are Sydney’s brightest
and smartest. Most of them are the
workers behind the successful Oppor-
tunity Shop in Rowe-street which is run
for the Peter Pan Free Kindergarten in
Paddington. And it is for the Peter Pan
Kindergarten that the Wool Ball is being
held. Mrs. Ernest Watt is designing
charming invitations which will adorn
your morning mail in about two weeks’
time. Women dancers are asked to come
in woollen evening frocks. In Mrs. Field-
ing Jones’s absence (she is on her way
overseas) Mrs. R. Moses is president of
the ball. Invitations are two guineas each,
and dinner will be served at nine o’clock.
Just returned from Japan in the Mer-
kur, Red Cross representative Maureen
White, who was the only Australian girl
attached to the R.A.F. station at Iwakuni.
She taught handcrafts and ran a library
for a 60-bed hospital for Australian,
English, Indian and other nationalities.
Every six weeks she made a 48-mile trip
by launch for fresh stores, and every two
months another by air to Miho to teach
handcrafts there. She spent one leave in
Hong Kong. Maureen left for Melbourne
last week.
From Melbourne
Eileen Joyce has an excellent dress sense,
and every gown she wears seems more
lovely than the previous one. At the mid-
week concert she appeared in a period
gown of shell-pink coin-spotted taffeta,
with deep pannier effect in the skirt and
a low-cut bodice. Her second gown was
filmy-white chiffon, the skirt sprinkled
with silver sequins and the bodice em-
broidered lavishly with the same decora-
tion. When she appeared with the A.B.C.
Symphony Orchestra t 6 play the Rach-
maninoff Concerto in C Minor, Eileen
wore a Nile-green chiffon gown, the skirt
very full and the bodice trimmed with
gold sequins. A drapery from each side
of the low-cut neckline went over the
shoulders to form sleeves and was
gathered at the back of the waistline into
a bustle bow.
Lady Dugan was in the audi-
ence, her sweeping gown of pastel-
green crepe worn under a hip-length fur
coat. She was accompanied by Mrs. A.
A. Lord, whose black gown carried gold
sequins, Mrs. J. O. Haselden and Pene-
lope Nettlefold. Mrs. John Chaldjian,
who has just returned from England,
covered her black gown with a mink
coat; her net snood was patterned \yith
black-jet beads. Mrs, Edward Stevens,
the '9O-year-old member of the ladies
committee of the Celebrity Concerts,
wore a brown-ermine coat over a black
gown-; her tiny black-straw hat was
trimmed with pastel-pink taffeta ribbon.
Mrs. Ross Stable wore a pink hat. clus-
tered with pink and wine-toned flowers
with her smart black coat. Mavis Hot-
mer had one large blue flower in the
brown-silk straw hat which was companion
to the belted brown-fur coat. After the
concert Professor Bernard Heinze, who
had conducted the orchestra at the con-
cert, and who earlier in the day had re-
ceived his M.A. degree at the Univer-
sity, and Mrs. Heinze entertained Eileen
and a few guests at their Toorak home.
Mrs. Heinze’s long midnight-blue wool
coat with beige-fox collar covered a
floral evening-gown. At the party was
Mrs. J. O’Donnell, of Adelaide, whose
Chinese-patterned floral gown was worn
with a dyed-ermine coat.
The University Dramatic Club loses
one of its most capable actresses when
Robin Mackay, pictured here by Broo-
thorn, leaves soon on the Corinthic for
England with her mother, Mrs. Colin
Mackay. Robin recently played the
feminine lead in “He Who Gets Slapped,”
which was the 1948 Commencement play.
She has appeared at the Little Theatre
and also with the Tin Alley Players.
Tall, slim and with gracefulness and per-
sonality, Robin goes abroad to continue
her studies in the drama.
Over the past years the Town and
Gown Guild, which does excellent work
for the University, has worked to raise
money to equip and replace crockery and
table linen in the cafeteria. Its first
function of the year was held at
the Hawthorn Town Hall. Mrs, E. C.
Rigby, wife of the Mayor, lent to the
committee, which is headed by Lady
Lowe, wife of the ’Varsity’s Chancellor,
her reception-rooms for a card-party.
Other means of gathering in the coin were
a fancy-goods stall presided over by Mes-
dames Essington Lewis and L. J. Mc-
Connan; a cake stall which Mrs. G. I.
Stevenson and her daughter Pamela or-
ganised, and a sweets stall where Mes-
dames H. G. Connell., W. MacLennan,
Farron Webb and John Grey were busy
to good effect.
At her birthday-party at MenZies Gladys
Moncrieff and her guests celebrated.
Gladys wore a full-length coat of dyed-
ermine over her black crepe jacket suit;
the jacket was heavily beaded in jet
With her ensemble she wore a red felt
beret trimmed with black-coq feathers.
The skirt of Mrs. David Martin’s outfit
was very full, and the short cutaway
jacket was worn with an off-the-face hat,
black to match the suit, and was trimmed
with a cluster of blue and mauve flowers
under the brim, Mrs. Frank Tait wore a
black-tailored suit with platina furs; her
shoes were the new Spanish ballerina,
black high-heeled court with a frill of
black crepe de chine at the back. Gladys,
who is commencing a tour of the Com-
monwealth, including country centres, will
give her first concert in the Melbourne
Hall on Saturday, April 24.
When Joan Elizabeth, elder daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. W. Stevenson Fraser, of
Toorak, was married at St. John’s,
Toorak, she wore the wedding-gown that
. had been worn by her grandmother, Mrs.
G. P. Newman. Of heavy magnolia
satin, it featured a bouffant skirt with a
train, the bodice having a square neckline
edged with cream lace. The cream tulle
veil was caught in place with a coronet
of orange blossom, and she carried a
shower bouquet of frangipani and pale
golden roses. The bride was attended by
Belinda Fraser and Pat Tallis, who wore
bouffant frocks of floral marquisette over
taffetas. The bridegroom, Lieut* Alistair
McDonald, only son of Brigadier and
Mrs. R. T. A. McDonald, of Toorak, had
Lieut. Colin Trumble, R.A.N.V.R., as
best man and Capt. William Jamieson,
Staff Corps, as groomsman. Leaving the
church the bridal couple walked through
an arch of swords held by fellow staff
corps officers of the ’groom.
The reception was held at the home of
Mr. and Mrs. J. C. Leviny, of Toorak.
Mrs. Fraser’s coat of Spithead-blue wool
cloth had a modified “new look,” with
its full skirt and belted waist. Her
matching blue-felt hat was folded back
with a stiffened bow of harebell-blue
taffeta ribbon. Mrs. McDonald’s frock
of greige chiffon was full-skirted ; a small
dyed ermine cape and wide-brimmed
beech-brown felt hat trimmed with match-
ing velvet ribbon completed a neat out-
fit. Mrs. Leviny’s tailored coat in sage-
green had touches of fur on the lapels;
her felt hat was also in sage-green.
Highlight of the Australian Ballet
Guild’s short season at the Union
Theatre was “Petit Point,” with choreo-
graphy by Corrie Lodders, a Ballet Guild
member, and decor by Ruth Shackell.
The ballet, to the music of Schubert, has
no narrative, the moods of the music
being interpreted through the interchang-
ing of partners and the weaving of pat-
terns. Very short ballet skirts of pastel-
pink and bustle bows were worn by
Grace McLean and Strelsa Heckleman.
Despite heavy rain and a cold, biting
wind, balletomanes turned up in force.
President of the Guild, Lady Best, who
wore a formal black dinner-gown, kolin-
sky-fur cape and small black-lace-straw
hat, clustered with deep-red roses, was
accompanied by her daughter Roberta
and son-in-law. Mrs. E. J. Lewis was
in dark-brown beaverine coat and brown
fur toque with a gold-mesh crown. Mrs.
N. J. Clarke’s black Persian-lamb coat
was worn with a small black hat trimmed
with coq feathers. Mrs. Des Connor
wore a small blue-flower hat with her
black-tailored coat. Over her black frock
Jean Darragh wore a full-length brown-
musquash coat. Joyce Beetham’s hunters’-
green coat suited well her fair coloring.
Twenty-seyen-years-old J. Lee Thomp-
son, an air-gunner in the R.A.F., wrote
Murder Without Crime, which was de-
scribed by the late James Agate as “per-
fect theatre.” This thriller was presented
by the Tin Alley Players to a large audi-
ence on opening night at the Union
Theatre. Among applauders of a splendid
show were Mona Robinson, whose
floral frock was worn under a black
coat; Mrs. Pat Hanna and her
daughter, Mrs, Clive Landau; and Rex
Rienits and his wife, whose blue-
and-white-striped silk beret was an un-
usual touch.
Torn Beckingsale, who leaves for South
Africa in the Corinthic, was guest-of-
honor at a dinner-party given by James
and Janet Bowen Pain in their Collins-
street flat—the first the hostess has been
able to attend since her recent illness;
Another special guest was Strella Wilson,
just arrived from Perth. Janet received
her guests wearing a formal black crepe
dinner goam embellished by a spray of
gardenias. Strella also was in black;
Tora’s black-net dinner gown was coin-
spotted in gold and her hip-length coat
was of Chinese-red quilted satin. Mrs.
Erl Grey favored a ballerina, frock of
black satin carrying gold ornaments.
Grace Hunter’s black-satin skirt was also
ballerina-length, and with it went a white-
satin tunic, Judy Garrard was another
guest who chose black; the skirts of the
pastel-toned dinner frocks worn by
Dorothy Glasscock and Mary Coles
were knife-pleated. Among other guests
y/ere Freda Irving—her hair-do and dress-
ing showing a Spanish influence—Mrs.
Ivor Mclrmes and Pat Jarrett.

THE SERVICE MAN
A New Constitution?
“Ek Dum”: In the smooth,
suave, open manner which he
adopts when he is not being
frank with Parliament, Mr.
Chifley last week explained a
Bill to amend the Supply and
Development Act, 1939-44.
This measure, he said, pro-
vided that secrecy should be
observed by people employed
at the long-range weapons-
range; it also ensured the
safety of the public in the
operation of the long-range
weapons-ranges and acknow-
ledged the possibility of com-
pensation if accidents hap-
pened. He gave the impression
that everything else in the bill
was merely an incidental and
trivial reversion of detail from
war-time to peace-time organisa-
tion, with the subordination of
munition-making to more im-
portant matters'.
What the bill actually does is
as follows: It amends the whole
structure of the Supply and
Shipping, Aircraft Construction,
Shipping and Development
departments the rocket-range
provisions are trifling minor
matters, some of them seemingly
reaffirmations of laws which
already exist in the Defence
Act and other Acts.
The changes proposed embody
startling amendments of the
Supply and Development Act,
1939-44.
Under the old Act, which is to
be amended, the function of the
Supply and Development Minis-
try was to administer —for a
limited period —all matters relat-
ing to “arrangements for ascer-
taining costs and limitation of
profits in relation to the produc-
tion of munitions, and, subject to
the direction of the Governor-
General, for the provision of
the supply of munitions, aircraft
production, extension of defence
industries, acquisition of goods
for defence and certain other
phases of industry” in time of
war. It was an emergency
measure.
* ‘ War-materiel”
This section has been amended
in two ways. The purposes set
out above are not those which
“shall be” the functions of the
Department. The word “in-
clude” now replaces the word
“be.”
The word “munitions” is
wiped out of the Act, and in its
place is the phrase “war-
materiel,” which is defined to
mean “armaments, weapons (in-
cluding long-range weapons),
ammunition, engines, magazines,
aircraft, vehicles, merchant-
ships and other marine craft,
equipment, supplies, baggage
and other things needed in war
and indudes any goods com-
ponents, parts, accessories or
plant necessary for, or incidental
to, the testing, development, pro-
duction or supply of any of
these things.”
Under the old Act, before
anything became a “munition”
work in the meaning of the Act
it had to be declared by the
Governor-General as “necessary
for»the purposes of defence.”
But “war-materiel” under the
new legislation need not be de-
clared “necessary for defence.”
It merely has to be something
normally “needed in war,” which
covers almost everything on the
face of the earth at all times.
And thus, while the old Act
placed the limitation of defence
need on every establishment
dealt with by the Common-
wealth under the old Act, this
limitation is removed entirely by
the new Bill.
To the end of the existing
section is tacked on these words:
The Governor-General may from
time to time (a) add to or vary the
matters to be administered by the
Department.
The above clause is the vital
one. It gives power to the
Ministry acting through the
Governor-General to declare
anything from lingerie to mov-
ing-pictures, from coconut-ice to
newsprint, and from racehorses
to potatoes to come within the
ambit of the Act and its price-
fixing and almost omnipotent
powers of regulation and con-
trol. It can allot any function it
likes to the department. Further-
more, it is obvious that this is
not only a measure which can
be applied at any time.
A simple clause has been
added,’ further, just to make the
matter complete, which pro-
vides that one of the functions
of the department shall be “re-
search, design and development
in relation to war-materiel” ; so
that if at any time potatoes or
ice-cream are declared war-
material, research and “develop-
ment” regarding them may be
taken over.
It is clear that T. J. Ryan and
E. G. Theodore, who in Queens-
land passed the Sugar Acquisi-
tion Act, which was used
to control the Wolloongabba
night-trotting, were timid ama-
teurs beside the Chifley Govern-
ment.
In the original Act it was pro-
vided that the Governor-
General might “from time to
time determine the extent to
which, or the conditions upon
which, any of the matters speci-
“ Heavens , Premier gast! Whatever takes you ashore on
a night like this?”
fied in paragraphs (a) to (e) (in-
clusive” in the section defining
departmental functions might
be administered by the Depart-
ment ; but this has been amended
to remove any restriction.
The Governor-General is now
to be empowered to “determine
the extent to which, or the con-
ditions upon which, any matter”
—any matter at all and not only
those specified —“may be ad-
ministered by the Department.”
When read in conjunction with
the subsection giving the G.-G
authority to “add or vary the
matters to be administered by
the Department,” the complete
machinery for the socialisation
of the country seems to be in-
cluded in this clause. And lest
there are any loopholes in these
defence powers, some further
safeguards are taken by the
draftsman, who looks like Dr.
Evatt at the very top of his form.
Section 6 of the original Act
prescribes that where, in the
opinion of the Governor-
General, it is necessary or desir-
able in the interests of defence
that information should be ob-
tained in relation to the indus-
trial, commercial or other under-
takings, or with respect of any
goods, the regulations may re-
quire such persons or classes of
persons, as are prescribed, to
furnish information and par-
ticulars prescribed with respect
to those undertakings and goods.
But this has been amended by
substituting the word “activi-
ties” for the word “undertak-
ings.” Thus, having secured
power to include Under the con-
trol of the Minister any type of
goods whatever (and price-fixing
powers included), the Minister is
also given power to require in-
formation without limit from
not only businesses concerned
with defence, but from every
man, woman and child in the
community about any “activi-
ties” which they have a desire
to investigate.
Stalin could do no more than
the Minister will be able to do
under the new Act. Political
organisations, newspapers, busi-
nesses will become subject to de-
mands for unlimited information
which they must give without
the slightest safeguard or pro-
tection if the Governor-General
and the Ministry decide to bring
them within the ambit of the
Act and regulations mefely on
an allegation being made that
the information has a defensive
bearing.
“Undertakings”
The next amendment is' in
Section 9 of the old Act, which
reads:
The Governor-General may estab-
lish, maintain and operate or arrange
for the establishment, maintenance
and operation of factories for or in
relation to the provision of the supply
of munitions.
“War-materiel” is, of course,
substituted for “munitions” —
the definition already has been
given. And for “factories” the
word “undertakings” is substi-
tuted. There is a delightful
definition of undertakings which
suggests that this legislation pro-
vides the machinery for as much
wholesale socialisation as is
found possible under the Consti-
tution through a misuse of de-
fence powers:
Undertaking means a building,
depot, establishment, factory, labora-
tory, experimental station, magazine,
range, observation-post, store or
works, maintained or operated by
or on behalf of the Commonwealth
development in relation to war
for purposes of research, design or
materiel, or for the procurement,
supply, manufacture, testing or stor-
age of war materiel.
Not for the purposes of de-
fence. That is carefully side-
stepped.
There are some provisions en-
suring permanency for existing
regulations—they need looking
at very closely—and there is a
new clause providing that a
person “engaged or employed to
perform any duty or function
in relation to any matter speci-
fied in or arising under this
Act,” or its regulations, “shall
not be under any liability, civil,
or criminal, in respect of any
act or thing done by him in the
course of his duty unless it is
shown that he acted negligently
or without reasonable care.”
“Security” Provisions
After abolishing the Aircraft
Production legislation the
amending bill comes to a sup-
posed security clause for the pro-
tection, inter alia, of rocket-
ranges about which Mr. Chifley
made so much play.
This long clause includes
power to appoint boards to ad-
minister undertakings and de-
fine their functions ; measures
for defence of the property of
the Commonwealth, including
search of persons entering or
seeking to enter “undertakings.”
Also for:
The entry upon and use on behalf
of the Commonwealth of any area
of land or water, including land and
water held of right by a State, tor
the purpose of any undertaking; the
declaration of prohibited areas [pre-
sumably meant to cover areas which
are not already covered by the De-
fence Act] the requisitioning or com-
pulsory acquisition of any minerals
or other goods required for the pur-
poses of defence; the building and
repair of merchant ships and the
building and maintenance of shipyards
for dry-docking and repair of mer-
chant ships.
And power is added to previ-
ous wide powers to “make regu-
lations to amend or repeal any
regulations in force by virtue of
this Act.”
Permanent
The original Supply and De-
velopment Act was specified by
the Menzies Government, which
passed it, to continue in force
for five years. In April, 1944,
this was varied to give it force
“until a date to be fixed by
proclamation as the date upon
which the Act shall cease to be
in operation, and no longer.”
This section has been wiped
out completely. It is proposed
to hang this piece of legislation,
far more drastic and totalitarian
than anything passed during the
war, round the necks of the
Australian people permanently.
It is a barefaced measure
which can be used for the com-
plete socialisation of industry in
war-time and for as much
socialisation as the Government
can get in time of peace.
It looks not like a Supply and
Development Act but like the
new draft Constitution of the
Australian Socialist Republic.
The authorities constituted under
it could easily be transformed
into Socialist Councils and the
Ministry into the Supreme Eco-
nomic Council, which has figured
so largely in the past in Labor’s
socialisation plans.
Danger Grows in
Europe.
“Ek Dum”: The news from
Europe becomes every day more
ominous in spite of the light-
hearted assurances of Mr. Ded-
man and other such authorities
that nothing will happen for ten
years.
What is happening is the more
alarming because it comes at the
present season, and because of
the directions in which the pres-
sure is moving.
The task of dealing with the
Russians in occupied zones of
Europe is like dealing with
quicksilver. They are never
static for any length of
time. Their tactics are usually
to institute some sudden and
brutal restriction on the freedom
of their allies. Next they smil-
ingly give way. Then they create
an incident or two. They
violently reject a request for an
inquiry or for a rational sort of
inquiry. Or they agree to the
inquiry and refuse to attend at
the last moment, leaving the
opposition in the air.
Having by such methods pro-
vided a basis for propaganda in
their own country that they are
being subjected to annoyance
and intimidation by the Western
Allies in the interests of capi-
talist imperialism, they begin
moving troops.
These were their tactics in all
internal and external crises in
the countries which they have
taken over in Eastern Europe,
and these are the same tactics
which they are now applying
internationally.
Their stories of what is
happening in Berlin and Austria
have no resemblance to actual
facts. The impression is being
given in their broadcasts to
their people and to the Ger-
mans that their new restrictions
have been imposed of necessity
to combat wholesale pillage of
German and Austrian assets,
capitalist blackmarkets, organ-
ised (it is hinted) with the con-
nivance of the British and
American commands and an
arrogant invasion of Russian
rights under the Potsdam and
other arrangements.
In order to impress the sub-
ject peoples 1 of Hungary, Bul-
garia, Yugoslavia and Austria
they every now and then stage
some humiliation or insult to
Western officialdom. Such an
act was the looting of an Ameri-
can train repatriating Hungarians
at the end of January by Rus-
sian troops in combination with
the deliberate insult and mal-
treatment of the U.S. personnel
in charge of the convoy—an act
which this week was dealt with
by reprisal by General Clay, the
U.S. European-zone commander.
who expelled the Hungarian Re-
patriation and Restitution Com-
mission, which, in effect, is a
U.S.S.R. department thinly
veiled under Hungarian
authority.
Such also were the flying upon
the British Viking which was
wrecked at Gatow and the in- •
quiry concerning which the
Russian command sabotaged.
First the Russians refused an in-
quiry after forcing the British
to leave their dead on the ground
for many hours. Then they re-
fused a four-Power inquiry, but
were ready for a British-Russian
inquiry. Then they declined to
admit the evidence of witnesses
other than British and Russian.
And finally they made the whole
proceeding ineffective.
During all these proceedings
they poured out a stream of
bland Asiatic lies, promises and
statement? which in general
were designed to create confu-
sion in the public mind. Every
promise which they made was
broken. Their proceedings would
have reminded an eighteenth-
century historian of those of
Tippoo Sahib in his contacts
with the British in India.
The important factor in all
tfiese events is that they form a
pattern in a campaign to create
in the minds of their own people
a presumption of outrageous
provocation on the part of the
“capitalist” Powers and a justi-
fication for taking measures to
“defend” the against
“imperialist encroachment”
which is supposedly endangering
the safety of the U.S.S.R.
The inevitable corollary to this
type of manoeuvre is the move-
ment of Russian troops, tanks
and guns. It is nothing new. It
happened in Manchuria in
1938-39, and the aftermath \yas
shooting wifli the Japanese,
which might have turned into a
large-scale war if both parties
had not had other fish to fry—
as it was, it produced large-scale
forays, during which 6000
decorations were awarded to
Russian heroes.
It happened with Finland in
1939. It happened in the little
Baltic countries, always with the
same result. It happened in
1941 on the German borders.
And now it is happening in
Germany and Austria, where,
whatever must be allowed for
press exaggeration, there is cer-
tainly a distinct movement of
Russian forces.
The significant fact about
these is not that they are neces-
sarily large, but that they are
lieavy.
They are not patrol-type light
units. They are armored spear-
heads of the break-through type
—the most massive type of
attack machinery designed for
aggression, not defence.
A most serious political de-
velopment is the assault on
Austria’s freedom and inde-
pendence, Austria is being
plucked for cooking in the same
way as Czechoslovakia.
Austria is one of the two main
strategic gateways between East
and West Europe, its strategic
centre. With Austria totalitarian-
ised both gates between East and
West will have been slammed
tight. And this is something
that can scarcely be permitted if
the West values its safety. If
there is a coup by Communists
in Austria the odds on war in
the near future are about even,
with a bias on probability.
Meanwhile, British and Ameri-
can staffs are retiring from
Berlin to Frankfurt, though how
far the movement is to be carried
is a State secret.
The position is serious and
dangerous. Within a month it
may be critical. The chances of
war between June and Septem-
ber are greater than of war if
peace survives for five years.
And events in Palestine lend
color to those in Europe. There
King Abdullah, of Transjordan,
has issued a grave warning that
Russian officers are leading
Jewish forces.

RED MILL RUM.
Mainly, the SXC. programme at
Canterbury on Saturday was a con-
solation offering for the connections
of the poorer-class animals which
havep’t had much of a look-in over
the past few weeks of first-class rac-
ing. There were a couple of Maiden
Stakes for two-year-olds and three
Mixed Stakes events on the card of
eight races.
The S.T.C. showed good sense in
making the Maiden events level-weight
affairs, all horses carrying 8.5. Much
better, and fairer to all concerned,
than asking one maiden per-
former to concede another anything
up to a couple of stone on the
strength of a near-miss in better, or
the same, company.
A case in point was Cornelian, which
ran third behind Tidal (A. Mulley)
and Shoal in the Maiden for fillies.
Had the race been a handicap, Cor-
nelian, on Jhe strength of a good
second behind Sheba recently, would
have been topweight, or very near it.
As it was, she showed herself unable
to win even at level weights. A
similar event for colts and geldings
went to Magoo (W. Briscoe), a son
of Dhoti.
The S.T.C.'is also promoting some
worth-while winter races, and, at the
same time, giving trainers a little of
the recognition they seldom get. The
Canterbury Cup carried £l5OO prize-
money and the trainer of the winner
(Maurice McCarten) received £5O;
also, he was credited with points to-
wards the S.T.C.’s trainers’ premier-
ship, to be decided on such races and
carrying a worth-while cash prize at
the end of the season.
Ridden a beautiful race by N. Sell-
wood, who appears much more con-
fident since ending his freak run of
outs, Wellington downed Petulance
and Royal Court in the thrilling finish
of the nine-furlongs Cup race. The
trophy itself was of interest. A fine
example of the old-time silversmiths’
art, the graceful, ewer-shaped cup
was originally collected by connec-
tions of E.K. when that horse, named
after his owner, E. Keys, won the
Williamstown Cup in 1892.
Surprisingly neglected in the betting
in view of her good win the previous
week, Love Star (A. Podmore) took
the six-furlongs Flying Handicap.
Mixed Stakes events over the same
distance went to the very good grey
gelding Denali (S. Johnson) on the
9st. mark, and, getting away for once
on terms with the rest, the speedy
Mine Host with apprentice R. Coles
in the saddle. The Campsie Mixed
Stakes of 11 furlongs was won by
Casanova (J. Thompson), also on
the maximum of 9st. W. Cook rode
as fine a race as he has ever done
to win the Welter (9f.) on Frontal
Attack.
* * * *
At Mentone on Saturday—possibly
the last meeting to be held on that
very inferior course—favorites won
the first and the last of seven events.
For the remainder, punters found the
going distinctly sticky.
Royal Gem evidently didn’t relish
the plaster of 10.5 which he was
asked to lump in the six-furlongs
Powerscourt Handicap, for whiph the
minimum weight was 7st. As the
barrier went up, he rid himself of
his burden in one swift movement —
and “that’s how the favorite was
beat.” Second-favorite Nestor was
then left as the logical winner, and
comfortably defeated High Pro-
duction with Broadcast third and St.
Fairy doing well to finish fourth,
lumping only 31b. less than Royal
Gem had had.
Supporters of Laudate, favorite for
the 13-furlongs Tinamba Handicap,
were at least given a chance of col-
lecting ; Pur tell rode a perfect race,
but the horse was not up to the
mark. Winner of the event, after
holding off strong challenges in the
straight, was fopmer Westralian gal-
loper Royal Title (F. King), beating
Sir Actor and Sir Toba —quite a
touch of Debrett about it all.
Other favorites to leave backers
lamenting were Magnetic Vale, Dum-
fries and Hellenist. Magnetic Vale
finished third in the Avon Handicap
for two-year-olds, won by the 15-to-l
chance Balbeck (E. Johnstone), with
Kritiri second. Hellenist also ran
third in his race, the first Macalister
Welter, won by Solray, from Mag-
nina. Dumfries ran fourth in the
mile Stratford Handicap for three-
year-olds, Gallant Scout (R. Hutchin-
son) defeating Saxony and Sandy Bay.
On the credit side of the ledger, Sun
Eagle (R. Denham), starting at 5 to
4, had too much stamina for Sir
William, Mantrim and other jumpers
in the Boisdale Hurdle, and Typical
(G. Heagney) had the barest edge
on three others in the fine finish pro-
duced by the second division of the
Welter.

Three notable anniversaries were
marked by this year’s Sydney G.P.S.
regatta, held on the Nepean at
Penrith on Saturday. It was,
to begin, the 50th G.P.S. regatta;
it was the 25th year that Sydney Boys’
High has competed; and this week
they are celebrating the centenary of
free public education in N.S.W.
Appropriate, therefore, that Sydney
High, the only “free public school”
in the G.P.S., should this year have
swept the river.
There was a touch of comedy
in the couple of days’ final
training on the Nepean. Coaches
were returning from trial spins
wearing the sort of smile that be-
tokens something up the sleeve;
amidst rosy dreams the course record
was broken a dozen times. Eventually
one coach, after his crew had covered
a half-mile in something under world-
record time, rightly reasoned that,
since the clocks were right and the
times were impossible, there must be
something amiss with the course. A
survey showed it to be short by the
bare 150yds. Had this not been dis-
covered before race-day the 1948
G.P.S. regatta would have made row-
ing history.
As it was, High put up an effort
that should leave others something to
shoot at for a while to come. They
took the Head of the River title
and Major Rennie trophy for the
eights, and the first, second and third
fours. The eight and the first and
second fours set record times for
their respective races. On the Nepean
they missed out only in the fourth
fours event, won by Shore; in
addition, High won the junior eights,
decided at the Riverview regatta a
couple of weeks back.
It’s many years since as fine a
bunch of eights has contested the
Head of the River title. There was
little at the finish between High, New-
ington, Shore and St. Joseph’s, in that
order. Coach Frank Nichols’s instruc-
tions to row a patient race, ably
carried out by stroke C. Mahoney,
gave High the advantage.
Saturday was also G.P.S. regatta
day in Melbourne, some 15,000 boys.
Old Boys and general supporters
lining the banks of the Barwon to
see Xavier take the title. Xavier
rowed a game race, recovering from
difficulties which would have finished
a lesser crew, to beat Melbourne
Grammar by a length, with Geelong
third.

All concerned having put in some
solid work passing round the hat,
funds have been raised to allow of
doubling the Olympic Games team
of 34 originally selected. A party
of 74 has now been named to go,
provided that return transport can
be arranged; so far, in that direction,
there is provision only for 60. If
the team has to be cut back to 60,
the first to be scrubbed should be
the water-polo team of 10 and some,
at least, of the seven “managers.”
The majority of members of the
team would need to show remark-
able improvement to be in Jhe hunt
at the Games. As an indication,
two world records were smashed dur-
ing the week-end by American Negro*
athletes. One Fonville heaved a
161 b. shot a fraction over 58ft., and
Harrison Dillard covered the 120yds.

tralian records for those events are,
respectively, 46ft. lin, and 14.4 sec.

About 140,000 turned out for the
six opening matches of the V.F.L.,
most of them at M.C.G., South Mel-
bourne and Fitzroy. Except at Foots-
cray, where the locals belted St.
Kilda by 21.19 to 9.11, the games
kept the crowds alive. Best was at
South Melb., where the red-and-whites
ran all over Richmond in the last
quarter, 18.15-17.6. Others: Essen-
don, 13.18, beat Melb., 12.5; Carlton,

13.14, beat Geelong, 9.16; Colling-

competition, Parramatta beat Manly

Both in these games and in the
earlier trials special interest lay in
the performance of the Wallabies.
It is evident that some of them, how-
ever good they may have been before
they went away, have acquired a
polish overseas which must be a vital
influence in the coming season. Out-

Manly, Allan, playing again with
Gordon, and Howell, the Randwick

ABORIGINALITIES
“L.P.”; “I’d just turned thirty when I
came to these parts,” Jack the fossicker
told us. “Since then I worked in the old
Last Chance mine for ten years, was
boundary-ridin’ on Bullawalla for twelve,
and for the last eighteen I’ve been at this
game. I turned sixty last week.” “But
what you just told us would make you
seventy if you came here at thirty,” said
Tim. “No, I’m sixty right enough,” Jack
maintained. “O’ course, I was forgettin’
—there was ten years I was away workin’
up in Noo South. Take them off seventy
and that makes it right! ”

“Bo”; The boss was puzzled. “I can’t
make it out,” he said. “That duck
hatched the whole twelve out, they all
looked healthy enough, but eight of ’em
must have wriggled out somewhere- —she’s
only got four following her now. I’ve
searched the place from top to bottom,
but I can’t find a trace of the rest. I
wonder if that dopey new hand has seen
anything of them?” The boss’s wife
said he probably wouldn’t see them until
he’d tripped over them. Just then the
hand came out of the feedshed, and the
boss chatted him, “I picked the weakest-
lookin’ eight an’ wrung their necks,” the
hand announced casually. “I thought it
was havin’ such a big litter as that made
the duck look so miserable. Havin’ only
four to feed’ll give her a chance, an’
you’ll get the benefit, too —they’ll be
bigger an’ stronger. I only wish, though,
I could’ve told the diff’rence in ’em —I
hope they ain’t all drakes we kept!”

“Woody”; “Strop” (B. 31/3/’4B) might
be able to help. It was in Austria in the
early winter months of 1944 that I wit-
nessed this strange phenomenon. The
sun came out in the late afternoon, and
on a few occasions a sister sun, sur-
rounded by a pale spectrum, shone from
wispy clouds. I believe this “sister” sun
is called a “mock” or “dog” sun by the
farmers of England. On one occasion
two such “mock” suns were plainly visible
and about equidistant from the sun, one
in the vapor-trails of a flight of bombers.
Anyone seen a similar occurrence in
Australia?

“Bill E.”: Joe and Jt dropped in to the
little shanty pub on bur trip north, and
the 16-stone 6ft. proprietor growled
“What will it be, blokes? Don’t waste me
time, I got a sick cow down the back, and
I gotta fix her up.” “Well,” said Joe, as
we stepped back a couple of paces from
the bar, “how is the beer?” “My beer’s
good, mate,” he snapped. “It runs about
four fights to the schooner, and when-
ever there’s a fight in these parts I’m in it.
Now what’ll you have?” “Two
schooners,” said Joe, “but make ’em
lemonade.”

“Mic-O-Farad”: The submarine cable
spanning Bass Strait from Apollo Bay
(Vic.) to Perkins Bay (n.-w. Tas.) is very
different from the one described by
“Bosun’s Mate” (B. 24/3/’4B). A com-
bined telephone and telegraph cable, it
was laid in 1935 after exhaustive tests of
the sea-bottom by T.S. Taroona. The
total length is 165 nautical miles, overall
weight 1395 tons. The laying of the cable
is of historical interest, as the design was
the first of its kind in the world, and its
success inaugurated a new science in the
transmission of high-speed telegraphy antk
high-frequency telephony over Irfhg-
distance submarine cables. The single
copper conductor is an |in. in diameter,
and the return is a copper tape insulated
by paragutta, which at’that time was an
entirely new insulant and made the
achievement possible. Altogether seven
telephone and 18 telegraph channels and
a unidirectional broadcast-programme
channel are in daily use. Put into service
in 1936 the cable, like all other submarine
cables, has at times broken down. The
breakdowns have mostly occurred on the
southern end of King where the
sea-bottom is foul. It was underrun on
one occasion, and the route slightly
altered. Even so it is still subject to the
vagaries of the strong tides in the Strait,
and a father deviation in route is con-
templated.
“Nor’-west”: Description of a mod,era
sub-ocean cable by “Bosun’s Mate” (B.
24 1 3 / ’4B) may be correct, but I won’t have
it that the shark and the teredo-worm
are the cable’s worst enemies. The teredo
i? a wood-eater and nothing else. More, it
operates only within the zone of wa*rm
surface water, so if it attacked a cable
damage would be confined to the
first few hundred feet off-shore.
My dad, who was on‘ the ship that
laid the first cable ’ across *the Atlantic,
“Ah, Weil; call it a day.”
always reckoned the whale was the real
culprit. No matter how carefully a cable
might be laid, there are always valleys
and gullies along the sea-bed across which
the cable will hang suspended. The
whale is always more or less tormented
by an itch, caused by the great bunches
of barnacles which fasten, often in masses
as big as a man, to its rather sensitive
skin. To ease itself of these the cetacean
resorts to rubbing ; not seldom it scratches
on the keel of an anchored ship, at times
a nori-west lugger. A stretch of sus-
pended cable readily becomes the back-
scratcher for whales for a thousand miles
around.. The whale is a deep swimmer,
and readily goes down thousands of feet;
it is doubtful if any shark ever descends
a thousand feet.

"Hanko”: Tim© was when most farm-
steads of south-central Victoria were
girdled by hedges of prickly acacia, a
bush native to Kangaroo Island. But
prickle-studded fleeces brought the
cockies less treacle, so they chopped it
out. As a kid, I sighed at the prickly-
one’s passing. Its blossom was golden
and scented and beautiful beyond the
wattles, and it was the haunt of many
birds. Magpies built on its flattened tops ;
the little yellow-rumped tits hung their
two-storied nests from its branches; the
tiny white-fronted chats had their nur-
series about its suckered trunks, and
bronzewing pigeons came in droves to
glean the seeds that the acacia shot far
and wide from its bursting pods. Even
now, when I visit the south-central dis-
trict, I feel there’s something gone out of
it, something the frigid sugar-gums can
never replace.

“Taswegian”: During the last grain
harvest in S.A, I had my first experience
of bag-sewing. Fd been working for
about three days when, at the tea-table,
the farmer and another hand started to
discuss an expert' bag-sewer who was
working in the district. “Sews his 400-odd
bags a day,” said the boss. (I gaped a
bit; my daily total was about 120.)
“Dunno how he does it,” said the hand.
The boss thought it was because he used
only 10 stitches—“ Knows just how to
place ’em.” “Ten! Gripes, I have to use
about eighteen to make it hold properly,”
replied the hand. Now, I had been using
10, sometimes only eight or nine. I didn t
know whether to boast about it or not;
after a bit of thought I decided to play
safe and increased my stitches to about 18
a bag. Soon the blow fell. “Hey!
The boss called me over. “These are no
good. Look.” He gave one of the bags
a few vigorous thumps, and some grains
of barley were forced out between the
stitches. “You’ll have to do better than
that; those bags’ll leak when they get in
the stack.” Dreams of myself as a
champion bag-sewer vanished. But I
must admit that when the loaders came
with their truck and elevator one said
“Why don’t you sew ’em like the bloke
who did those? You’ll do more” —point-
ing to my heap of eight-stitchers!
* * *
“Bybren”: When old Bob Matson went
to the siding to pick up half a dozen
ewes he’d bought at the city sales he got
Dusty Forbes to go along and give a
hand. The train was even later than
usual, so, having time to spare, they
started poking around in the freight-shed.
As Bob pulled a fire-extinguisher down
from the wall for closer inspection it fell
to the floor and fair oh the plunger.
Foam spurted everywhere; and as Dusty
turned round to see what all the din was
about he collected a mouthful. By the
time Bob had finished wrestling with the
gadget and the thing had spent itself,
Dusty was still spitting the foam out.
When they reached Bob’s place two hours
later Dusty was still complaining about
the “poisonous taste” in his mouth.
Dave Baker dropped in on Bob next
morning with the news that Dusty was in
a lot of pain and his missus had sent for
the doctor; a worried frown creased
Bob’s face all day, but there was no hint
of the guilt he felt when he presented him-
self at Dusty’s place that evening. After a
preliminary word with Mrs. Forbes he
went on in to Dusty’s bedside, all smiles.
“When I first heard y’ was crook,” he
said, “I thought it must have been that
foam I hit yer with yesterday. Gripes!
Was I relieved to hear you’d broke a
toe! ”

“Mat’s Mate”: If the big fellow be-
lieved he’d been got at he had his own
way of making reprisals, as a prominent
citizen of a large rural centre discovered.
We were clearing a couple of hundred
acres for him on contract, 50 miles
or so out of the town, and his words and
actions led us to believe he was one of
those large-handed and generous coves
to work for whom is a pleasure. Not
long after the job started he arrived by
car to see how we were going, expressed
satisfaction, and, in an off-hand manner,
said he’d left a few pounds of spuds at
our camp which he’d found had been
left in his car. We made casual noises of
gratitude and toiled on. Four months
later we finished the job and went into
that town to settle up. There we found
the boss inhabiting a large office, with
sundry clerks about him. We’d worked
everything out when he suddenly said,
“Oh, we nearly forgot those spuds. Re-
member them? They ran into one and
eightpence.” I blinked, and saw Mat’s
eyes narrow, but I didn’t want a row
over 20 pence and hurriedly made the
adjustment. At the pub afterwards Mat
was silent and furious, and I wished there
was a train out of the place that we could
catch before he started something. Just
before tea Mat vanished, and I put in
an anxious hour till I saw him coming
to the pub with a bag of spuds on a hand
truck. At midnight he dragged me forth
to assist in his revenge. As the train
drew out next morning we crowded to
the carriage window. There in the morn-
ing light stood the boss’s home, sur-
rounded by its white picket fence, and on
the point of every picket was stuck a
potato.

“Zake”: Harbingers of rain in the
bush are as plentiful as a McGirr’s pro-
mises, and from black cockatoos and
spiders to rheumatic toes and the crescent
moon with a horn dipping are equally
unreliable. Predicting the next/ day’s
wind has many practitioners; the
queerest I struck was a bushman who
studied the heavens at night for long and
keen periods. This was his speciality:
If two meteors flew across the firmament,
both travelling in the one direction, the
wind next day would blow the same way.
He claimed it to be infallible. It might
be. In 40-odd years of life I
haven’t yet seen the phenomenon —still,
I might before it’s curtains. When I
suggested that two meteprs travelling
in opposite directions might indicate
a north-south wind he got quite narked.
* * * *
“G. Roper”: That white was a sign
of weakness in an animal (B. 24/3/’4B)
was a theory old when the first Dutchman
made his first Australian landfall. And
in Australia it has ruled to such an extent
that white draught-horses, common 50
years ago, have practically disappeared.
But with the feathere.d tribe the theory
fails to hold—no one will deny the
superior egg-laying capacity of the White
Leghorn: while with the ducks the White
Muscovy is equal in size and weight, and
superior in flavor, to any of its darker-
feathered fellows.
* * * *
“Nor’-west”: But I entered the theory
that downpours of frogs and fishes were
carried up originally by a waterspout—
and a spout is not necessarily a cyclone
(B. 17/3/’4B). It would be an outsize in
cyclones that travelled at more than
70 m.p.h., and in the days of open planes
men frequently took a higher velocity
than that on their bare faces without
injury. So frogs and fish may readily
whirl inside a waterspout without damage.
As for how they get down without injury
—well, Galileo pretty clearly worked the
matter out on the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
When the spout loses its velocity it falls
as heavy rain, its aquatic passengers fall-
ing with it. These, owing to a lesser
density in comparison to bulk, become
somewhat buoyed-up by air resistance,
thus falling slightly slower than the drops
of water. So they descend as in a liquid
cradle.
* * * •
“Betcha”; Heard a city visitor com-
plain of the scarcity of wildlife in the
district, and elicited the information that
he had walked far into the bush about
midday without sighting more than rab-
bits and a few birds. In the same vicinity,
creeping along trout streams at evening
or shortly after daylight, I’ve met any
amount of wallabies and ’roos coming
down for water. Have silently watched
foxes catching grasshoppers or picking
themselves a meal of blackberries, and
have disturbed a pair of dingoes follow-
ing their guiding noses to a dead beast.
One morning I held my rod and waited
motionless while a couple of long-tailed
brumby mares, each accompanied by a
shaggy youngster, drank from the next
hole and went their way, and a bit
further on made the acquaintance of two
inquisitive emus. Apparently attracted by
something glittering on my accoutrements
the feathered ones! advanced to within a
few yards, where their investigations
were ended by a wave of the rod and an
imperative order to beat it. Bush life?
It’s there right enough—if you know how
to look for it.

“Trade Wind”: “Macnell’s” Kris dance
(B. 7/4/’4B) omitted the resurrection.
After the men are down two lines of
Balinese maidens emerge from behind the
goddess. Their half-naked bodies are
anointed and powdered, eyebrows shaved
and painted, and each wears a crown of
tropical flowers. In front of the converg-
ing columns steps the High Priestess, a
beautiful maiden whose legong, a bit of
knotted nothingness, whispers as she
walks. With a lithe leap she gains the
centre of the stage. The music stops.
She stands a moment, arms upflung,
head thrown back, eyes shining, bare
torso dappled with light and shadow,
courting admiration. There is not a
sound. Slowly the priestess of Kali begins
to dance, a modulated symphony of
eurythmics in direct contrast to the men’s
frenzy. Following, the lines of girls turn
to their prostrate men, swinging censers
of incense, bending and sweeping round
the trance-like forms. Waves of perfume
waft over their bodies. Slowly the men
wake. They sit up, look dazedly round
at the ring of faces, then, followed by the
dancers, creep unsteadily away into the
jungle.
THE WILD RAMU.
(FOR ANZAC DAY, 1948.)
When I had come once more to linger on
Your hill, old friend, above the wild Ramu
I thought your grave seemed of some older day;
Your once-white cross was faded into grey,
The helmet placed above your head was gone,
The ridge of stones we raised for guard was
rolled
Away and the rank grass grown over you;
And all that recent death seemed very old.
I wondered how it was with you and thought
To tell you of the world: of how we came
To find (as grim as any ever fought
With guns) another war among the host
Who had not known to fight; of how Guy s
Post
And all that death had not been understood;
Of how you now are nowhere more than name
Save in the minds of men who can recall _
That time and how it was with them and give
To you their thoughts in calm memorial —
But these were thoughts best left till all’s at end.
But if you’d know of me, then know I live;
And if you ask of life, my friend, then know
That in your earth there is no clutch of pain;
If of the valley and the ridge, to gain
Whose heights you died, my friend,'so much is
good:
The native goes among the kunai grass,
The hawks, against the hot, relentless blue,
In widening circles sweep on tireless wing
Over the Valley of the White Man’s Death;
All is as when Creation first drew breath —
The snakes among the river-rushes pass
And midge and small bird and the waters sing
As once you heard them by the wild Ramu.

“Bardie”: Dogson had about 40 acres
of scrub selection a mile or so up the
creek from his farm, and he put Andy
on to clear it. Andy used to booze a bit
at week-ends, so Dogson was surprised
when he cut this out and didn’t call to
collect his wages. When Andy was
offered a cheque at the end of a month
he said to let it wait a bit; he could
hang on till the job was finished. The
clearing went ahead slowly, for the block
was well covered with blackberry, wattles,
stumps and logs, and it was close to six
months before Andy had it ready for the
plough. Then he called on Dogson. “1
got it figgered y’ owe me one hundred
and twenty quid,” Andy said. “That’s a
lot o’ cash, seein’ as how I reckon the
place is on’y worth about fifty bob an
acre. Now, I wouldn’t mind takin’ that
little block on meself, milkin’ seven or
eight cows an’ growin’ an acre or two
of spuds. At fifty bob an acre that’d be
an even hundred. S’pose y’ let me take
over the block an’ twenty in cash t’ boot
an’ call it quits.”

“Colonial Cove”: “Shamuseen” (B.
24/ 3 1 ’4B) misses something in quoting con-
ditions of abos of Cape York (N.Q.) 14
years ago. Fifty years ago I*was observ-
ing the abos of the Coolgardie goldfields
and the Great Victoria Desert, one of the
most drought-stricken and hungry parts
of Australia, and I can vouch that though
they were poor specimens of Homo
sapiens they were plentiful enough and
showed no signs of degeneracy. Thirty
years earlier than that John Forrest, mak-
ing his first venture into the desert along
much the same tracks, had found natives
in tribes of hundreds. Anyway, hasn't
“S.” heard of the cruise of the Rattle-
snake? Captain Owen Stanley, who gave
his name to the range known intimately
to thousands of Diggers during the last
war, had as his assistant7Surgeon a young
man named Thomas Huxley. That was
just on a century ago, when Kennedy
made his ill-fated attempt to reach Cape
York by overland route. The trained
of the Rattlesnake found no
miserable degenerate blacks about to
perish, but, instead, virile warriors
hardened by warfare carried on for past

ages with the natives of the not-distant
Torres Straits islands. What blackbirders,
pearlers, beachcombers and others have
done since to the blacks was what
“Shamuseen” found 14 years ago.

“B. A. Ker”: Thirty-one years make a
vast difference to the appearance of a
rural district, and I suppose I should have
been delighted to see such amazing pro-
gress had been made in my old hunting
(literally) grounds. But the tarred main
street lined with modern shops—includ-
ing two “high-class meat purveyors” in-
stead of the little butcher’s-shop—left me
with a sad feeling. There were rows of
fibre-houses where the grove of box-
saplings used to grow, and not a house
had a melon or pumpkin on the roof.
Standing on a corner I saw hundreds of
people pass without sighting one familiar
face amongst them. It was obvious, too,
that the old custom of bidding strangers
the time of day no longer existed. De-
jected, I made a tortuous square-cornered
journey—all the short-cuts were fenced
across or built on —to my old mate’s home.
Bill hadn’t changed; and in his son’s
aviary I found some other friends of my
barefooted days; Zebra-finches, double-
bars, goldfinches, redheads and one
diamond-sparrow. “A dyke!” I ex-
claimed. “That’s what I missed more
than anything on the way here—-the long,
low whistle of a dyke.” The kid looked
surprised. “He doesn’t whistle,” he said.
“I didn’t know they could.” I took a lot
of convincing, but found the boy was
right. And here’s where I call on “Wip-
pegong”: If a diamond’s egg were
hatched by a redhead and the fledgling
reared by the same bird, would the
diamond-sparrow develop its native call
although it had never heard the notes?
If so, the answer must be that there are
dumb birds.

“Murray”: A few miles upstream on
the Murray from Lyrup (S.A.) two gums
grow approximately 20yds. apart. A few
feet from the ground the main trunk of
each tree divides in two, only to join
again. This occurs several times until
about 25ft. from the ground both trees
meet and grow together.
« * * •
“Nakh”: Two sea-elephants brought
back from Macquarie Island by the Com-
monwealth Antarctic expedition are em-
barrassing the authorities of the
Aquarium in Melbourne. Six feet long,
they should attain to a length of 18ft. if
all goes well, and if their appetite keeps
pace with their magnitude they should
require about 1201 b. of squid a day, plus
a few mouthfuls of sand to aid their
digestion. This quantity of octopus would
require the full-time labors of at least
two men, as squid isn’t plentiful in Vic-
torian waters. Speculation has been sus-
pended as to what will happen if there
is any increase in the population, as their
sex hasn’t yet been determined. Why the
huge sea-slugs weren’t left at Macquarie
Island instead of being condemned to a
life of dirt and misery in Melbourne is
another question.

“Esk D.”: Jingle of traps on the floor,
and the fat plough-horse lurching down
the rise between the shafts of the rab-
biter’s sulky. Rabbits, hung in pairs,
heads downward and long ears waggling
to jolts of the wheels on stones. A furry,
grey row of them across the back and
more on the front; odd pairs dangling
from the steps and beside the seat. The
whiskers of frost on the open terrace are
being lathered by curling wisps of en-
croaching river-fog. The sun, which
climbed brightly over the range an hour
ago, shines wanly. Tim Jorkins sits
hunched on the seat, a dark shape as im-
mobile as a statue. There are dewdrops
on his black moustache and big hooked
nose, and the hands on the reins are grey
and calloused. At the foot of the rise he
stirs the nag to a trot on the winding
track across the flat; by the gate he waits
20 minutes for the panel-van of the car-
cass-buyer, who hops out rubbing his
plump red hands. Their greeting is in-
evitable. “Cold! What y’ got?” “Yair,
it’s cold. Forty pair.” The buyer checks
them off and scribbles in his book.
“They’re down a penny this week,” he
says cheerily. “Aw, that’s on’y two bob
a pair,” Tim growls, “Four quid for a
night’s yakker. Gripes, a man’ll be down
t’ bread ’n’ drippin’ if they don’t im-
prove. Hardly worth me while settin’-up.”
He is still muttering as he drives away
to prepare for the next night’s catch.

“Old-timer”: Big Jim Cadogan and I
padded into Wagga, our pockets and
nosebags empty, our feet sore and our
swags heavy. We hadn’t eaten since the
“Keep going , Alf; we might get hack on the rails again at the next
level-crossing
previous noon, and at Colinroobie the
publican wasn’t listening to bagmen. As
we dropped our swags under the bridge
Jim said, “By gosh, there’s a old mate
o’ mine. Used t’ live in Wagga. We
shore at Kilfera an’ Arumpo an’ them
places, but George married some tabby
he struck in Wentworth an’ I ain’t seen
him since. Must be twelve years ago now.
I struck a bloke up in Euabalong coupler
years ago who was tellin’ me George
got a job drivin’ a dray in Wagga ; s’pose
he’s still about. We’ll be right f’r a few
bob an’ some hard drinkin’ if he is. Tell
y’ what, you battle round f’r a bit an’
I’ll see if I can dig him up.” About
two hours later, having scored a few
handouts, I returned to the bridge.
Cadogan sat glumly on his swag. “You
didn’t find him?” “Aw, yairs, I found
him all right,” he growled. “A bloke
gimme a line on him an’ I go t’ a house
an’ a woman there sends me up to a hall.
Strike me fat, it’s a flower-show an’
there’s George, done up like a sore toe,
wearin’ a ribbon with ‘steward’ writ on it
an’ drinkin’ tea with a parson an’ some
wimmen.” He gazed stonily at the im-
passive ’Bidgee for a moment; then he
sighed: “Y’ know, the bush ain’t what
she used t’ be.”
* * * *
“Hanko”: Strange that a bird so
notable, so sought-after, can remain but
a trilling in the moonlight. Up and
down England I’ve heard the nightingale
sing its lisping song, but I never met any-
one who’d seen one. In Devon I once
stalked a nightingale singing in a rhodo-
dendron clump, and rushed the shrubbery.
I’d have been satisfied with a glimpse of
a dark shape darting away, but I didn’t
l get it. I console myself with the thought
9 that, with the swishings and crackings of
whips all around me, I’ve never seen a
coachwhip-bird, and it makes its noise
in the daylight.
* * * *
“Fencer”: Spotting the span of fence
that had sprung up, mushroom-like, dur-
ing the past week, I stopped to comment
on Plugger’s effort. He grinned, waved
an arm, directing my attention to the job
he was doing, and went on twitching tie-
wire. The posts were bored above the
netting, and along the outside the brawny
bloke had loosely run his wires. Now
he was threading the ties through the
holes and twitching the wire tightly to
the outside of the posts. “Like the idea?”
he chuckled proudly. Then, as I scowled,
“What’s the first thing that goes in a
fence?” he demanded. “The posts, o’
course. Whether it’s a fire or just rot, it’s
the flamin’ posts that have to be replaced.
Yair, and the way you blokes thread the
wire through the posts y’ve got t’ puil
down a whole span t’ put in a few
newies.” “Yes, but” “Well, don’tcha
see, with this here, all I’ll have t’ do is slip
off the ties. Me own idea,” he beamed.
“Gripes, it beats me why nobody has
thought of it before.” I glanced along.
Plugger had about finished the tying, so
discreetly I remembered business else-
where, and withdrew before he tried to
strain his wire.
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
“Billy T.”: Long John is methodical
and patient, and these virtues are re-
flected in the conduct of his cows. They
enter the yard at milking-time without
being driven, they wait their turns, and
as the right gate opens they walk sedately
to the correct bails and behave as cows
should whose training has been quiet,
clean and complete. The milking over.
Long John scalds his machines, sweeps
out the few specks of dirt dropped from
hooves, and the shed is ready for next
time. Occasionally,, however, a car-load
of cousins arrive from town. They swarm
into the yards to “watch the cows come
in,” and the cows don’t; they prop, back,
wheel and bolt from the bright array
in their usually drab preserve, but are
finally rounded up, joyously aided by
the visitors, and forced into pen. There,
with a babbling chorus flitting cheerfully
about the bails, each cow has to be coaxed,
shoved or coerced into the place where
normally it walks with quiet precision,
and once in the bails the immediate
terror of the animals results in a disorder
which even L J.’s dexterity with the short-
handled shovel fails to overtake. At this
stage the more pernickity of the visitors
begin to drift away, leaving the tougher
types with Long John, tightlipped but
red-faced, seeing the business through to
the end. The last cow out —possibly she
falls over, for all the others have skidded
out ahead of her—the Long Bloke sets
about washing-out his shed, muttering
the while upon the puzzle of people who
can wear eyes in their blasted heads yet
can’t use ’em. The visitors are by then
spinning along the road to town amazed
among themselves why such a nice, quiet,
clean chap like cousin John can possibly
stick such a rotten job.

“Fitzjay”: When Dan landed back at
camp minus his trousers he explained:
“A snake struck at me and a fang got
hooked into the leg of me pants. Well,
if there wasn’t a circus! He leapt and
twisted like mad. Out there on the plain
there wasn’t a stick anywhere about, so
at last, as Joe couldn’t unhook himself,
I had to work the strides off and leave
’em with him!”
* * * *
“Flip”: Alf, the stationmaster, was
able to tell the police-sergeant and the
irate mob with him that the little bald-
headed bloke they mentioned had got
off the 8.15, inquired if there was a
watchmaker in town, and had left him
feeling that they had met somewhere be-
fore. On inquiring what was up, Alf
learned that the small chap had set up a
table in Bombina-avenue and had offered
to the township’s denizens a “liquid
magic.” Praised by royalty and Prime
Ministers, as a watch-cleaner no other
preparation could compare with it. All
his clients need do was open the backs
of their watches and soak them overnight
in a saucer of the fluid. When no buyers
came forward the vendor of magic had
said, “Well, I’ll pour some in this saucer
and you can come up and soak your
timepieces free. I’ll be here all day,
and if you’re satisfied with the improve-
ment, you can buy a bottle later.” Many
repeaters were dunked; later in the day
the watches disclosed the first faint stains
of rust. Alf was sorry, but the little
bloke had caught the two-o’clock west.
Nearly a week later another stranger, a
travelling watchmaker, hit town. Busi-
ness was brisk, and working at a flat
rate of ten bob a time he quickly
acquired a wad that would just fit his
hip-pocket. Alf also vaguely remembered
seeing him before, and finally hit it —
but unfortunately not till two hours after
he’d flagged away the train the visitor
had caught. But he rang the sarge.
“Gripes, we should have collared that
watchmaker, Mac. Him and that little
bloke that doped the watches —I just
remembered that I saw ’em at Bogulla
show five years back. They were sellin’
explosion-preventers for kerosene lamps
then.”
AH HUNG THE CHINAMAN.
Ah Hung he lived in his dark hut:
Ah Hung the Chinaman,
Who was, when we were young, the butt
For jokes played by our clan,
When metal blue we often threw
On to his roof of bark
And waited till he said he’d kill
Us all when it was dark:
Till he would sigh, “Oh, allee lil
You allee die, me kill byme-by!”
Ah Hung, with Chinese hat on:
“Him weather welly dly 1 ”
But times when throwing metal palled
And night the darkness brought,
Then we upon our bellies crawled,
And fresh excitement sought,
And stealthily—oh, mystery!—
With hardly breath to draw
By road and rut we reached that hut
And through the door-slit saw
A knife held high: “Killee young Guy!
Jim Smith, muck hi! Cut tloat, byme-by!
Dlink blood, hi, yi! Me eatee eye!
Me makee pie! No usee cly!”
Ah Hung, of pole and baskets:
“Pea, callot, welly ni!”

THE MAN ON THE LAND
"DO N'T WORRY . I'M SENDING IT TO GRAZCOS."
Wool Growth on Lambs.
“Archaps”: In its efforts to
improve fine-wool production
the C.S.I.R. has been conduct-
ing experiments aimed at learn-
ing more about wool fibre from
its embryonic stages to maturity.
Bulletin No. 215 gives results of
these experiments to date, and
one interesting fact is that the
fleece of the new-born Merino
lamb may contain up to 25 mil-
lion fibres, which the Council
thinks is probably only 20 to 25
per cent, of the fibre number in
the adult fleece. Twenty unborn
lambs were studied at various
stages of development. The fol-
lowing conclusions are drawn:
Primary follicle development be-
gan on the crown of the head
before the 50th day of the ges-
tation period, and by the
58th day follicles covered practi-
cally the whole of the body.
Secondary follicles developed
first on ffie crown of the head
about the 80th day, and 20 days
later on the scrotum. The first
keratinised primary fibres ap-
peared in the skin on the crown
about the 84th day, on the neck
about the 91st, on the belly about
the 95th and on the perineum
about the 100th day.
Manchester Method.
“Anti-fly”: At Warren
(N.S.W.) show next month a
practical demonstration of the
Manchester method of treatment
of sheep to give lifetime im-
munity against blowfly-strike
will be given by las. McKay,
president of Warren Graziers’
Association. A similar demon-
stration was given to 200
graziers at Moree show.
Increasing numbers of graziers
are recommending it to others
since it has proved effective,
inexpensive, rapid and practi-
cally painless (sheep graze im-
mediately after treatment). It can
be done by any intelligent man.
It was discovered by Captain
Manchester, veterinary surgeon,
of Charleville (Q.). A bare patch
is created in the crutch area and
under the tail, ensuring that
these areas cease to attract fly.
The amount of wool lost is in-
finitesimal and is usually stained
and of no value commercially.
The bare patch improves the
health of the sheep and reduces
odor. Wrinkled sheep can be
similarly treated. It is done
only once in a sheep’s life, and
no crutching or jetting is needed
after treatment.
Riding the Colt.
“Wirrameju”: When all the
preparatory work of handling,
mouthing, saddling and mount-
ing has been done properly the
job of riding the colt is com-
paratively easy. For he should
now have confidence in you,
know he is not being hurt, be
used to your being around and
accept your climbing on to his
back.
It is thus comparatively easy
to teach him to move about
freely with a man on his back.
It is when a colt has no confi-
dence fn his rider, and is afraid,
that all previous lessons are
thrown to the wind and he in-
dulges in bucking and/or bolt-
ing, Very few, if any* horses
are instinctively bad. Once you
realise that riding is not the most
dangerous part of colt-breaking
you are ready to ride. A colt is
very quick to size up your state
of mind and act upon it.
Face him up to the centre-
post, make him stand “spread”
and mount exactly as you have
been doing in your mounting
exercises—excepting that this
time he is not tied to the post.
Sit there for a few minutes until
he is used to it. If he offers to
walk, unconcerned, round the
yard so much the better. Talk
to him, pat him and be sure
that he is fully aware of you. If
he doesn’t volunteer to walk his
earlier training will come into
use, and a touch of the reins will
usually start him off. After a
while you can urge him with a
gentle heel-kick in the ribs or a
tap on the elbow with the iron.
Remember, he has to learn the
meaning of these signals ; so they
should not be hard enough to
startle him, I prefer tapping the
elbow with the iron, as this does
not necessitate loosening the
knee-grip on the pad. At this
stage your colt should walk
quietly, but at attention.
Next night follow the same
procedure. But now he may be
urged into a brisk walk or a
trot —no jogging half-hearted
gaits. Start at the beginning to
make him go freely, to walk and
trot as fast as he can do com-
fortably and to canter freely and
evenly at all times. The time is
right now to go over all your
mouthing lessons again. Make
him circle and do figure-eights
round the yard at a fast walk
or a trot if your yard is big
enough. If he is well mouthed
he will do it naturally without
resistance, but the experience at
this stage is valuable, particu-
larly if he is a bit nervous. In
the following lesson just trot him
round and round the yard,
changing direction every few
minutes.
Once again the measure of
your success will dictate the
time to be. spent on this phase.
I usually find that in three half-
hour periods he will go quietly
and attentively, so I give him
another for good measure. One
thing is certain —he is not ready
to leave his yard until he does
go completely quietly. If he
does, then he can be taken out
and walked, trotted and led
round the country like any hack.
For this I make a practice of
giving the colt a mate while he
is being broken—a long-since-
broken horse who lives with the
colt excepting during his actual
school hours. They will be-
come friends. When the colt is
taken out of the yard I have
someone ride the old horse
alongside. If that old horse is
viceless, quiet and reliable he
will have a wonderful quieten-
ing effect on the colt. Nonethe-
less, avoid main roads, bridges,
etc., for a few days (or our colt
might learn to “shy”) until he is
quite settled down.
When he has settled down, in
three or four days, urge him for
the first time into a canter. If
your methods are faulty, your
temperament is impatient and
your horse-sense low, then grab
your “monkey,” but if you have
the least modicum of horse-
sense and the old hack handily
in the lead the colt will go along
as though he’d been doing so
for years.
Engine Valve Clearance.
“Radian”: When a plate on
the side of an engine reads
“Valve Clearance ,01 Sin. Hot”
it means that the space between
any tappet-head and valve-stem
should measure 15 thousandths
of an inch when the engine is at
normal working heat and the
tappet at the bottom of its
travel. Clearance as specified is
most important, and should be
measured with a proper thick-
ness-gauge. Valve-clearance nor-
mally takes care of two factors:
(1) Elongation of valve stem
under heat, which would other-
wise prevent seating, (2) final
correction of valve timing to
give best engine performance.
The fact that an engine will run
with almost any valve-clearance
does not mean that anything like
peak efficiency is being de-
veloped, either in power output
or fuel consumption per horse-
power hour.
To adjust valve-clearances,
turn the engine until exhaust
valve is fully open and adjust in-
let valve so that the correct
gauge will slide under the valve
stem with just a suggestion of
tightness. Lock the tappet and
recheck with gauge. With inlet
adjustment correct turn the en- *
gine until this valve is wide open
and adjust the exhaust the same
way. Repeat the procedure for
each cylinder in turn.
In engines not fitted with ad-
justable tappets —Fordson trac-
tors, for instance —the valve stem
must be filed or ground to pro-
vide clearance. Service-stations
use a special machine for this
purpose and have a gauge which
measures the correct amount to
be taken off; however, an or-
dinary hand-grinder or wet
grindstone can be used, and will
give reasonable results. If a
grinder is not available, hold the
valve against something solid
and use a smooth file across the
stem, turning it often to correct
error. When grinding or filing
remove metal a fraction at a
time and check carefully until
correct clearance is reached.
A Woolshed.
“R.A.A. Sergeant”: This plan
for a shearing-shed is worth
considering, and the one I struck
is most successful. The shed-
floor is 6ft. above ground, which
allows a large area for holding
sheep in wet weather. As the
sketch shows, the sheep go up a
ramp to the holding- and catch-
ing-pens and, when shorn, go
down the chutes (marked s) into
the counting-out pens, which, of
course, are partitioned off from
the rest of the under-shed space.
The design leaves plenty of
room between stands and wool-
table (w.t.), with the piece-pick-
ing table (p.) out of the way,
though handy. Thus the shed-
hands never cross the shearers
in any way, wool goes to the
bins, thence to press (w.p.) and
thence is stored. The loading-
platform (1.p.) is 6ft. above
ground, making loading easy.
This plan is for a three-stand
shed and can easily be enlarged,
the enginehouse being outside on
the west wall. The scale of the
plan is roughly |in. to Ift.
Sorghum-poisoning.
“K.W.R.”: AH plants of the
sorghum family contain prussic
acid. The poison is concen-
trated chiefly in young stalks,
but decreases as the plants grow.
Stock should never be allowed
on immature sweet sorghum,
especially if it is wilted through
dry weather; second-growth
and immature frosted crops are
both dangerous. Sweet sorg-
hums are most palatable and
nutritious when the grain is in
the milky stage, the best time to
cut it. Once the heads are well
out the stuff is usually safe.
The best antidote for sorg-
hum poisoning is a mixture of
solutions of washing soda and
sulphate of iron. Dissolve loz.
of washing soda in one pint of
water and, in a separate pint of
water, £oz. of sulphate of iron.
The ingredients should not be
mixed until immediately before
application as a drench. Two
pints of the mixture are suffi-
cient for a cow, half a pint for
a sheep. If drenching cannot be
done the mixture may be poured
into the stomach through a
cannula inserted as for bloat, a
hand’s-breadth forward of the
point of the hip-bone on the
left or near-side.
Greenfeed for Fowls.
“J.J.A.”: Poultryfarmers faced
with high prices and acute
shortages of grain and other
poultry feed, and also with low
prices received for eggs, must
look for ways to reduce ex-
pense. Cut down the bran and
pollard in the mash and increase
the quantity of green-feed fed
with the mash. Meatmeal
should be fed instead in pro-
portion to the amount of bran
and pollard. This is to balance
the proteins that would have
been supplied in the old mixture
by bran and pollard.
Cut the grain given in the
afternoon down to a minimum,
which should be just sufficient
to pass the mash through the
birds. For cockerels and non-
layers, wheat need not be fed,
oats or another grain being used
instead. Oats can be fed to
fowls in cold climates, e.g., New
Zealand, but in hot climates are
too heating. Green feed con-
tains almost everything neces-
sary for fowls, and this method
of feeding is being used exten-
sively in America, where wheat
is £1 a bushel.
A Balanced Pasture.
“Mr.”: Stock troubles are
less likely to develop on a well-
balanced grass-clover pasture in
flush periods than on a clover-
dominant one. Clover alone is
rich but risky. It lacks balance,
has too much protein and not
enough fibre. This can be
remedied by introducing a good
hardy grass like Wimmera or
perennial rye, with perhaps a
little oats, and the best time to
do this in Victoria is the
autumn.
Balance in the first year can
be got by using a fairly heavy
seeding of 51b. or 61b. of ryt-
grass, or, say, 41b, when a light

sowing of oats is included. When
the rye or rye and oats have
germinated, graze them regularly
and fairly heavily to keep the
clover down, but allow spells be-
tween grazing to give the sward
a chance to develop. If it gets
a good start it won’t hurt to cut
perennial rye for hay in its
first year, but Wimmera rye is
best left uncut in its first season
to grow plenty of seed. Before
sowing, graze the paddocks bare
and sow the seed with a com-
bine after the first Tains, using
a light harrow to cover the
seed.
Victorian Seed Wheat.
“Myrr”: Graded, pedigreed
seed of Insignia, Pinnacle and
Diadem wheats is available for
Victorian growers. Insignia for
the Mallee, Pinnacle and Dia-
dem for the Wimmera, though
both may do well in other areas,
notably northern Victoria. Five
bags is the most any one grower
can get. Orders to the Agricul-
tural Supt., Department of
Agriculture, Melbourne. Price,
f.o.r, sending station, 13s. 4d. a
bushel.
The Rabbit Pest.
“Remos”: “Kamac” holds
(B. 17/3/’4B) that once the
burrows are destroyed the rab-
bit becomes easy prey. Does it!
What of neighbors’ and Crown
lands where little or nothing is
done in destroying cover? Our
place is approximately 4000
acres, and in normal year-s we
resort to furrow trails, laying
strychnined apple cubes. In one
year we have picked up and
burned up to 4000 rabbits. This,
in these times, is a huge waste of
wholesome food. I have been
experimenting with penned rab-
bits, using on them" drugs that
will make an animal of rabbit
size inert long enough to be
picked up. My idea is that the
doped rabbits can be gathered,
resuscitated and killed for food.
I’m also treating springs and
drains so that only doped water
is available to the rabbits. The
Governments don’t seem in-
terested, though a rabbit-buyer
who goes through our holding
bi-weekly pays 2s. per pair for
first-grade fresh rabbits.
“Woolly”: Those who claim
that the rabbit benefits Australia
should take a look at the values
of food exports from this
country for the six months
ended December 31 last. Some
of the principal items were:
Butter £7,561,518, beef
£3,822,475, lamb £2,517,095,
cheese £1,009,693. Rabbits and
hares accounted for £751,935, in
addition to which one must
allow for fur and skins. But
against these wool gave us
£16,063,743. We’d have to
handle a lot of hares and rab-
bits to get near . that. In cold
fact every shilling brought in by
rabbits takes out at least a fiver
for expenses and losses in other
directions.
Hints for the Farm.
“Sarina”: It is not now be-
lieved that the botfly is anything
more than a nuisance to the
horse. Rarely does the larva,
which hatches after the nag has
swallowed the eggs, cause any
real injury. Presence of the fly,
however, is alarming to nervous
horses and may cause them to
strike and injure anyone hand-
ling them. A smear of sump-
oil on neck and withers of
draught-horses discourages the
bots.
“Sundowner”; A sowing of
broad-beans in April will give
a nice crop in spring. They do
best in veil-limed soil, with
super, added at loz. or 2oz. to
each 6ft. of row, applied in 2in.
bands away from the seed. Be-
cause of the nitrogen returned
to the soil when the stalks are
dug in, broad-beans are im-
portant to the rotation of the
kitchen garden.
“Urana”: Acting on advice
(B. 31/3/ ’4B) to use oats as
poultry - feed we tried them.
Wheat was short and wp had
plenty of oats and fed them to
the fowls. After a few days
some hens became mopey. A
few died. Called in, the local
vet. said they were suffering
from punctured crops, caused by
the oats sticking through the
inner skin. He added that it
was always risky to feed oats
raw to fowls for that reason and
advised, if we must use them,
to cook them first.
“Troy”; If blady grass or
paspalum mars the lawn dont
cause holes by attempting to dig
it out. Repeated mowing will
eventually kill blady, and if a
sharp, strong knife is inserted
just below ground and the pas-
palum roots cut off, the top can
be lifted out. In very few cases
will there be regrowth.
“Bai”: A good whitewash for
palings, outhouses or kalsomined
rooms, etc., is made by slaking
51b. of lime and adding to it ilb
of powdered glue and -rib. of
powdered alum, both dissolved
in hot water. Strain and cover
from dust. Let stand for a
couple of days and thin to con-
sistency of cream. Soak the
brush in cold water for some
time before use. This wash can
be tinted pink with red ink, blue
with the laundry knob, cream
by experimenting with perman-
ganate, saffron or coffee.
“Will C.”: If mixing cement
without a proper mixer you will
need a tray of some kind. Cut
the top or bottom off a worn-
out tank at the second or third
“ring” and use that. When
finished with, the tray may be
filled with a mixture of sand,
road - dust and wood - ashes,
sprinkled with sulphur, and
given to the fowls as a dust-
bath.
“J.J.H.”: It sometimes hap-
pens when using a mouldboard
plough that the point of the
share has worn too much and
will not ‘*bite.” To get the most
out of it, try placing a small
piece of sheet metal under the
top rear-end of the share and
tighten the share-bolt. This will
give the share extra dip .at the
point. By this method you can
often finish a paddock without
a trip to the blacksmith.
QUESTION ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service
Department.)
What can be done in the case o)
a sow with only 14 teats which has
farrowed a litter of 16 suckers?
The following procedure is carried
out in practice: (1) The odd suckers
are destroyed; or (2) If another
newly-farrowed sow with a small litter
is available, some of the suckers are
transferred to her; or (3) The odd
suckers are fed by bottle, using warm
cow’s milk diluted with 50 per cent
sterilised water, to which has been
added lactose at the rate of one tea-
spoonful per pint of liquid. As the
suckers grow in strength, the quantity
of water added to the milk should
be decreased. It is most importam
that the utmost care as to cleanliness
should be observed in feeding suckers
by hand, and they should be fed as
much as they will drink every three
to four hours.

IS YOUR SLAVE
Cooking with on AGA is so easy, so
clean, and so much bettor. Day or
night it's ready whenever you want to
use it. AGA burns continuously - 1 - a
hot oven whenever you need it.
Fuel cost? Incredibly small. AGA's
amazing heat-storage principle enables
it to give maximum efficiency with a bare minimum of fuel
in fact it is the only cooker in the world that is guar-
anted not to burn more than a stipulated quantity (which
varies with each model).
As for kitchen comfort, AGA cookers are scientifically insu-
lated. All outside surfaces (except the hot plates) remain
cool, which means a comfortable room temperature at
all times.

Enabled you to live so far
From these dull days when forty

If strikes turned off the Mermaid

With candles unprocurable

With union men from first to

Set off by eyes of brilliant blue-

But understandable mistrust
Would scarcely help him to re-

If he concluded that they weren’t

“Stalin is among the list of 18
candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize.”
Joe threw down his pen as a
comrade - secretary respectfully
blotted the last of the big list of
purge-sheets the Red Fuhrer had
just finished signing, and looked
up at his Foreign Minister.
“How many does that make
liquidated this week for harbor-
ing anti-Communist thoughts?”
he asked.
Molotov reflected. “About
two thousand. Comrade
Fuhrer,” he replied. “Your
splendid efforts for promoting
peace within our Fatherland are
bearing fruit —six months ago
we were liquidating over eight
thousand weekly. I anticipate
that within six months, by which
time we’ll have bumped off
about another fifty thousand
traitor-reactionaries, you may
proudly boast that your earnest
efforts to effect a beautiful amity
by discouraging, through such
pacific means, the enemies of the
party will be completed, and you
may truthfully claim that you
achieved it without one drop of
blood being spilled.”
“True, Molo, thanks to our

by our friend Paulus’s staff —they

and they are so economical, be-

cause the better - nourished
victims supply the fuel for the
next batch. You know,
1 sometimes think of myself, so
peacefully inclined am I, as a
new Messiah. Look how many,
after all, that I have helped to
achieve eternal peace the
millions I’ve made for ever
happy!”
“And why shouldn’t you go
down to history as the new
Prince of Peace, Comrade
Fuhrer? * Remember that a
prominent sympathiser to our
cause in far-off barbaric Aus-
tralia has publicly stated that our
aims are Christlike —by the way,
the rebellion we planned in
Colombia was a great success:
five hundred slaughtered, and
Bogota is now only a looted,
smoking ruin.”
“That incident alone,” put in
Joe, “should ensure my winning
ot the prize if there is any sense
of fair play left outside our
Soviet borders. By arranging
the insurrection through our
fifth-column there we prob-
ably saved the whole world from
a bloodbath, for our Intelligence
had discovered that the blood-
thirsty reactionary Government
of Colombia was about to
launch another world war in
pursuance of its policy of im-
perialist expansion; the Soviet
bloc was singled out for the on-
slaught. By the way, talking of
fifth-columns, I see our Aus-
tralian one has botched another
great opportunity of taking over
the country on our behalf. If
they can’t do better than that
threaten to cut off their subsidy
—that’ll quickly bring them to
heel. How are the rest of my
great efforts for peace
going?”
Molotov rubbed his hands.
“Splendidly! ” he exclaimed.
“We’ve supplied a hundred
million roubles’ worth of arms
to both Arabs and Jews in Pales-
tine, so that when they’ve
slaughtered each other to suffi-
cient weakness we can walk in
and take it over —the British will
be out of it by then, and the
Americans will still be talking
about what to do.
“We’re keeping up the propa-
ganda war and threats against
Turkey and Persia, backed by
big frontier armies. We’re arm-
ing the rebels again in Azer-
baijan and lending them staff
officers and three disguised
divisions for a further attempt
to overthrow the central Gov-
ernment. Our campaigns.
directed by our Far Eastern High
Command with some Chinese
Communist help, are going well
in Korea, Manchuria and north
China against the Fascist Chiang
Kai-shek. We’ve sent huge
quantities of captured German
arms to our agents in Yugo-
slavia, Bulgaria and Albania for
the use of Soviet-directed attacks
on northern Greece. We’ve fully
armed our Italian fifth-column
and planned in every detail the
civil war to follow if the Italian
electors reject our nominees—
we expect to have up and down
the peninsula bigger and better
massacres even than Bogota.
Insurrections are planned for six
more Latin-American republics.
In Australia our fifth-column,
thanks to the immunity granted
by its Prime Minister and our
good friend Doctor Evatt, is
assured of a peaceful open go
in wrecking all industries in
preparation for the coup. We
are still working hard to promote
civil war in France, Norway,
Sweden and Denmark. Unfor-
tunately a censorious world too
often fails, FUhrer, to see the
purity of your motive —ultimate
world peace and tranquillity. I
sometimes think that in your
efforts for peace you make
the Divinity seem by comparison
to have been almost blood-
thirsty.”
Joe idly took up to admire
from his desk a model of a
poison-gas tank.
“Amenski to that!” he said
piously.

“Controls” i
Last year it cost nearly £lOO,OOO to
“control” prices of land, and to what
effect? The nurturing of a blackmarket
in property that involves millions of
pounds! What it costs to run the Prices
Branch, which so futilely chases motor-
car blackmarketeers, and wanders around
the suburbs dropping in on butchers and
bakers and candlestick-makers, only the
Auditor-General knows —and no one
seems to take much notice of him.
Meanwhile, with the steady increase
in building costs, it has long been
apparent that home-building is soaring
beyond the reach of the workingman.
What to do? Why, “control” it, of
course. Consequently, the Building Price
Control Regulations are introduced,
together with Chief Controller, platoon
of deputies, dozens of assistants and
hundreds of hangers-on.
Now, if you want to build a house,
your builder will have to supply a flock
of plans to departments so that his costs
may be assessed and price fixed before
a permit to build will be issued. The
time needed to go into the plans properly
will cause a tighter bottleneck than ever
in building.
Should the department start guessing
at prices to their disadvantage builders
will certainly refuse to undertake house-
building contracts. As an alternative,
they might begin dealing in pictures or
landscape-gardening as a means of mak-
ing up the deficit on the economic price
of the finished property. In other words,
a blackmarket will be fostered.
When will the Government realise that
the only factor which will control or
reduce prices in this country is “supply”?
In Sydney recently certain lines of
stationery have become competitive after
many years of scarcity and prices have
fallen. When materials are again pro-
duced in sufficient quantities to meet the
demand, prices will, subside without any
Government department to “control”
them— Jindivick (N.S.W.).
The Egg Board
A Victorian woman poultryfarmer
sent eight dozen fresh eggs to the Egg
Board. Payment for the consignment was
3s. 9d., less grading, handling, accounting
and selling commission and transit and
control-fund charges—total, 3s. 4d. The
board, with its usual meticulous fairness,
sent her a cheque Tor fivepence. Ex-
change on the cheque was sixpence, so she
lost a penny on the transaction. »
Mr. Dennett, the Victorian Minister
for Agriculture, announces that her com-
plaint is one of many.; Solution? He
has handed them to the “special commit-
tee investigating the activities of the
board, and allegations against its financial
methods,” and the committee “had not
finished its inquiry, as it was giving every
opportunity to every individual or
organisation to submit evidence.”
The aggrieved poultryfarmers had
better shut up or they’ll have still
another committee to pay for. —M. G
(Vic.). .
In the Vineyard
A temperature of lOOdeg. is not ex-
cessive in a vineyard (B. 31 /3/’4B). This
season at Renmark (S. A.) we picked in
temperatures up to 108.5 deg. It’d be a
poor lookout for blockers drying their
fruit if they didn’t get a few weeks of
hot weather.
“Bucket 32” says the pickers who came
by train had to walk two miles to work
each morning, and back again at night.
No wonder many of the men “gave the
show away early in the piece.” There’s
no need to accept bad conditions in times
of labor shortages,
‘We would stand on a distant hillside
with our two buckets full watching a
dray crawl towards us, half an hour
away.” Did they really leave you with
only two buckets at a time? Even with
a poor crop two wouldn’t keep you going
for 10 minutes.
This is how they do things at Renmark.
We had our return fares paid from
Adelaide, and the grower met us at the
bus terminus in his car. We lived with
me family ; board 30s. a week for me,
and 255. for my wife. The food was
excellent, and we were made to feel at
home. We worked from 8 a.m. until
■ P- m -> with 10-minute breaks for morn-
mg and afternoon tea, and an hour for
dinner. We worked a five-day week,
and our weekly pay was £6 ss. for me
and £4 13s, for my wife. We were there
over Easter and were paid for the two
holidays.
Most of the time we were picking—
currants, sultanas, gordos and malagas—
but we had a few changes, such as shaking
fruit from the drying-racks, spreading,
boxing-up, etc. The work was tiring
especially on the hot days, but
it made the teabreaks and the shower
after work all the better.
“Bucket 32” had better give that
N.S.W. vineyard a miss and come to Ren-
mark for the 1949 harvest. — Taswegian
(Tas.).
Communists
“Labor’s” defence of Communism
during the censure debate at Canberra
was lamentable. Only two points were
made: (a) that, as a political philosophy,
Communism has the same rights as
Liberal or Labor, and ( b ) that the Reds
would flourish rather than wane under
suppression.
There may be a certain amount of
philosophy in the doctrines of Commun-
ism, but so there was in the ideologies of
the Nazi party in Germany. From
“Labor’s” point of view both the Nazi
“Sorry, missus, cant take y —thirteen s an unlucky number."
and Fascist parties could set up here to-
morrow without interference.
“Labor” speakers in the House dwelt
with maudlin sentiment on the rights of
the Corns as a minority party. The
comrades are in a minority, but they are
far from helpless, as Dr. Evatt would
have us believe. They are exceedingly
powerful.»and well organised and will
stop at nothing to enforce their will and
beliefs on the majority. In not one of
the countries in Europe have the Corns
anything like a majority; even in Russia
a mere 9,000,000 impose their wills on
well over 200,000,000 souls. So why
should they worry about majorities here?
As for the martyrdom complex that
would result from banning, it doesn’t
seem to have worried the U.S.A. and
Canada in enforcing laws against them.
—J.E.F. (N.S.W.).
The tolerance —or weakness —accorded
social revolutionary elements by the kind
of political leader of whom Chifley is
representative springs from the fact
that politicians of this kidney, as
the French put it, “won’t have any
enemies to the Left.” When sub-
versives become menacing they either
ignore them or try to placate them with
bribes and concessions. Invariably more
and more is demanded until an impossible
situation is created. Then the conciliator
must resort to far more stringent mea-
sures than would have been necessary at
first, or he must throw himself com-
pletely into the hands of the wreckers.
Generally the latter course is followed.
Benes is a typical specimen of the
breed. So were the leaders of the so-
called “Popular Front” Government of
Spain whose tolerance of Communist and
anarchist terrorism brought about the
terrible civil war of 1936-39.
An earlier example occurred just a
century ago in France. The politicians
who attained office after the revolution
of 1848 were themselves moderate re-
publicans, but, as Bertaut wrote of one
of them, Lamartine, they feared that a
strong stand against social revolutionary
militants would brand them for com-
promising with the Right. Hence they
took the revolutionists into partnership,
giving their leaders posts in the Gov-
ernment and instituting measures they de-
sired, such as the notorious National
Workshops, in which every worker who
sought employment was to be engaged.
France was on the verge of economic
collapse before a break occurred. Then
four days’ desperate fighting in the streets
of Paris was necessary to suppress the
militants.
Communist policy is based on co-
operation with such people. Communists
know that there are few countries in
which they themselves could achieve an
electoral victory. But, by constant pres-
sure on a more popular political body
whose leaders refuse to have enemies to
the Left, they are able to create oppor-
tunities to achieve their ends. — Histori-
cus (N.S.W.).
Melbourne
There’s light-heartedness and clean
pavements in Melbourne streets. Its
people talk animatedly as they step along.
What do they talk about? About poli-
tics, of course—Communism takes up
quite a few hundred words—about the
opera, the races, the New Look, mysti-
cism, even romance they talk about. But
unlike us in Sydney, they can still think
on their city pavements besides just
the business of pushing along from one
given spot to another.
One thing I did not hear once spoken
of in the 14 days of my visit, and that
was the cutting-down of a tree. And
people in the hills of Frankston, Mount
Eliza and Olinda talked of buying-up
favorite corners to preserve tree and bird
and shrub. Melbourne is a city of trees
and parks and gardens.
Melbourne’s large stores are not more
richly stocked than those of Sydney, but
it seemed to the visitor this autumn
that many of them displayed their wares
with an air of distinction and “chic” that
we in Sydney have come to expect only
in the small, exclusive and expensive
salons.
And citizens must admire their Town
Hall, with its council-chamber gloriously
pannelled in Queensland woods, and
with a corridor of' such amazing length
that if need be the V.R.C. could run off
the Melbourne Cup there, in heats. And
of racecourses where is one to equal
Flemington? Its lawns and the women
who walk them are bright and suave.
And there is a nice touch of intimacy in
the vice-regal box being placed just in
front of the newspaper-women’s reserve.
In between races the aides wander to the
back of the v.-r. box, and leaning over
the dividing-line exchange hot tips with
the women scribes.
Down south they have not become so
bemused with the shadow-show of the
screen that the stage and real actor and
actress' is not still a vital force.
“Annie Get Your Gun” and the Kiwis
are still playing to packed houses after
record runs, and in the Princess Theatre
an-Australian-grown company is singing
Grand Opera. There’s an air of the
’Nineties about this theatre. It has a
foyer with a long street frontage. On
to the street look long and wide plate-
glass windows. Through them the trees
in the park opposite have an enchanted
air caught in the befrosted stillness of a
clear, autumn night. There is Parliament
House across the top of Bourke-street,
and church towers and spires press close
upon the city ways—in fact, are part of
them, for they are close neighbors to
shops and theatres. Melbourne evidently
regards religion as something to be mixed
every day with its fun and its commerce.
So, if you can’t go to Paris, go to Mel-
bourne, where felicitous and shining in
seasonal array the tall trees still grow
greenly and gardens light the way.—•

Service Recruiting
“Macnell” is right when he says the
Government should “sell” the Navy on
its experiences and comradeship and not
on the £ s. d. (B. 7/4/’4B). The R.A.N.
and the Army could take a few lessons
from the recruiting brochure recently
published and distributed by the R.A.A.F.
The booklet devotes much space to
explaining the different varieties of service
in the R.A.A.F. and winds up with a
short account of pay, pensions, ' etc.
Photos show the various aspects of the
service from mess and recreation to work
with the squadrons.
For weeks R.A.A.F. public-relation
officers delved through thousands of
photographs seeking illustrations which
depicted the true service life. They did
not want shots of airmen all dressed up
going on leave. They sought the service
life as it is, and they got it.
Photographs show the technical grades
—trained by the R.A.A.F. at its new
artisans’ school at Wagga permanent air-
station servicing a modern aircraft;
others, which appeal to air-crew-minded
youths, show the various aspects of flying
training, from the blackboard through
the elementary and service flying to
squadron life. Still others depict the
kind of open-air camp-life and training
likely to appeal to any young man with a
scrap of spirit in him.
Similar publications could easily he
prepared by the two senior services,
keeping in mind that prospective ser-
vicemen want to know more than
simply what their pay will be before they
enlist— Waddlin’ Willie (Vic.).
The Root of the Matter
• The Desert Corps lately has started a
movement for the erection of a war
memorial to the Australian horses that
went with us in 1914 to create the Anzac
touch and never returned. Many of us
are hoping that it will be a statue of a
good sort of bush horse in full rig in
some prominent spot in Sydney. And
why not add a booklet, illustrated, by
some writer who rode one of them? At
a reasonable price it should sell like hot
cakes among horsemen and eX-horsemen
all over Australia. — Greenhide Bob
(N.S.W.).
Colonel Yelizarov—the accent is on the
“Yel” —burst out at a Kommandatura
meeting in Berlin:
The British should remind themselves how
they looked on while Hitler’s Army looted
the Don Basin. The British ruling classes
and Imperialists gave Hitler arms to wage
war and afterwards looked on as this
machine was flung against the Soviet Union.
It would be better-for their security if the
British reminded themselves of the events
of 1940, when the U.S.S.R. supplied Hitler
with millions of tons of war material,
congratulated him on his conquest of
Norway, Denmark, Belgium and France
and applauded his bombing of “imperi-
alist” England, whose people Stalin and
Molotov from 1933 to 1939 urged to
make peace with (i.e., surrender to) the
“blood-drunk Fascist beast” of Berlin. —
E.D. (Q.).
Navy warrant-officers (B. 24/3/’4B)
are to be granted full wardroom status.
This was indicated in a statement intro-
ducing Navy estimates in the Commons
recently. Warrant-officers’ messes will be
abolished, and a w.o.’s rank improved to
stand with confirmed sub-lieutenants. To
emphasise that warrant-officers and com-
missioned officers from warrant rank are
officers in the Navy, the Admiralty is
prepared to change their title. Messes in
the R.N. and throughout the British
Commonwealth navies are being asked
for suggestions as to the new title. —
Conda (N.S.W.).
Robert G. Bowman, writing on “Army
Farms and Agricultural Development in
the South-west Pacific” for the American
Geographic Society, states that under ex-
perienced supervision and with adequate
supplies of capital, labor, machinery,
seeds, fertiliser, insecticides and fungi-
cides it is possible to obtain heavy yields
of food crops in Papua and New Guinea.
Perhaps, but on most of the Army farms
production costs were out of all pro-
portion to normal peace-time returns and
justified only by the importance of fresh
foods. — Gumboil (Q.).
