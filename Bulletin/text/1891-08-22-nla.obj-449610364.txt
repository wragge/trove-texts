lavished all her varied charms on BUCKINGHAM PAI K,
which is, without exception, the CREAM or PICK Eli
SPOT on the BLUE MOUNTAINS.
BUCKINGHAM PARK ESTATE
Is beautifully surveyed. The Allotments are unusually
large —from 100 up to 180 feet frontages, with long depths
—thus enabling buyers to have Garden, Tennis, Lawns,
etc., if they so desire. In fact, it may be truly said, there
is no finer Residential Land on the Mountains.
The BELGRAVIA HOTEL, MEDLOW, which cost £4OOO,
is now open for visitors, and is the First Hotel on the
Mountains supplied with the Electric Light, and the
Proprietor is willing to supply any' cottages built on the
estate with the electric light. Two elegant Villas are
now nearly finished on’this estate. The rapid advance in
the price of land at BLACKHEATH during the past three
years, amounting to fully 300 per cent., clearly show's that
early buyers at Buckingham Park will make a splendid
investment. Title is TORRENS, and the terms are liberal
and to suit buyers. For particulars, apply to the Pro-

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS. AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

gressions or excesses of more nature ago, bladder
difficulties, a whitish or dark ropy sediment in

blood hasty, uncontrollable temper, hacking
cough, who cannot marry, nervousness in society,
wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, general

sanity and death, should consult him, for he has
mastered these difficulties. On receipt of 6d. in

nervous system may be cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnecessary expence. ibis
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
tion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tend ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous it would be advisable for you to sit down
nuietly in your chamber and write to the doctor
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
ononion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work 'the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
tn the volume will bo found a list of carefully-pre-
“ red questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25 000 cases since coming to Australia, and
hns permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All

been applied to any object. In England, even the Cooperative Societies

This success is owing to the fact that the investor sees not only a fair com-

he would not receive from any other organisation. It has been left to Aus-

SATURDAY, AUGUST 22, 1891.
Electoral Reform.
The New South Wales Parliament has now
been in session five weeks, and during that
time it has accomplished nothing, save the
passing of one small Bill on a private night.
The political kaleidoscope of which Premier
Parkes is the showman has presented a-
fresh combination of fragments to the ob-
server. Four years ago Freetrade was the
predominant feature. During the latter part
of the last Parliament, Federation was
shaken into the foreground. Now, however,
Freetrade has been-jostled out of sight, and
Federation is barely perceptible, while Elec-
toral Reform has been allotted the premier
position. There seems every present pros-
pect of Electoral Reform sharing, in its turn,
the fate of its predecessors, and, after
serving to divert the electors for a while,
being shuttled out of view to give place to
some other combination. The history of Sir
Henry Parkes’ management of the affair,*
so far, gives assurance that he has no serious
interest in the business. Although, for the
past twelve months, he has been protesting
that his , Government is consumed with
anxiety to give legislative sanction to the
principle of One-man-one-vote, it has become
obvious beyond mistake that the subject has
scarcely occupied his thoughts. At the time
when the last Legislative Assembly had an
opportunity of legalising the principle as
embodied in Mr. Traill’s plain and straight-
forward Bill, which, where defective, could
easily have been amended, the Government
and its hangers-on veiled their repugnance to
the principle under a pretence that they
were eaten up with anxiety to give it full
effect by adding a provision to secure the
franchise to electors of the nomadic class, such
as shearers and sailors. They dwelt upon this
desideratum with desperate iteration. Even
when they had to face their constituents
they adduced the absence of any provision
to effect this as their excuse for throwing
out Traill’s measure. But a lurid re-
flection is cast upon the sincerity of
Parkes and his accomplices by a discovery
which; the present Assembly has just made
In the “comprehensive measure” that>Sir
Henr y has so long been incubating there is
no provision whatever for securing the exer-
cise of the franchise to the nomadic class .of
electors, and it is essentially a Bill designed
rather to disfranchise the average elector
than to remove the predominance of the
plural voter,
* * *
Sir Henry Parkes has confessed that his
share hi tire construction of his long-talkcd-
of and much-vaunted Bill was confined to
jotting a few heads on a sheet of notepaper,
and handing that scrap of writing to a Bill-
drafter for expansion. The course of events
amply corroborates this confession. From
the first formal step in connection with the
draft it became perfectly apparent that Sir
Henry had never even glanced at the Bill.
At the very outset it was discovered that the
title was inadequate to cover the contents,
and the Bill was no sooner presented to Par-
liament than it had to be withdrawn and
hurriedly re-introduced. Then the Premier’s
second-reading speech was so brief, so
scanty, and so bald a performance that the
first ill-impression was deepened, and finally
when the Bill, after a too-superficial de-
bate on its second-reading, came to be con-
sidered in committee, it broke down at
the very second clause which was submitted
to examination. Two entire nights were
occupied in the endeavour to lick that form
less and incoherent clause into shape, and in
the end Parkes was glad to be permitted to
withdraw it for the purpose of having it re-
cast altogether ! If this clause were the only
faulty one in the Bill, that single imperfec-
tion would bo sufficient to indicate that a
singular indifference had attended its pre-
paration. But the entire measure is cast in
a frame similarly defective, and its very
essence is one of disfranchisement,
* * *
During the earlier stages of the discussion
Sir Henry Parkes apparently considered
himself safe in assuming an attitude of
swagger. He would be content, he declared,
to accept such amendments as might serve to
render the Bill more effectual, but he would
regard as censure of the administration any
alteration which should affect the essential
principles embodied in the measure. Now,
it is customary to regard as essentials such
principles as are defined in the title of a
Bill, Among those which find a place in
the title of this measure is the “ensuring
and giving due effect to majorities,” a phrase
which clearly refers to the system of
second elections, as adopted in France and
elsewhere, and which can, in fact, refer to
nothing else in the draft. The provisions to
this effect were evidently flung into the Bill
without mature consideration. They are
merely a badly-executed copy of a crude
and ill-digested scheme propounded by Sir
Samuel Griffith in the Queensland Parlia-
ment. And now that Griffith has aban-
doned his propositions, Parkes, by a
singular coincidence, admits that he also will
not do anything very desperate should this
great essential be struck out of his Bill,
• # *
But already there are tokens that further
demands will be made upon the docility
which has succeeded to Parkes’ former
martial attitude. Having consented to with-
draw for remodelling the clause which
brought the Assembly to a standstill last
week, the ugly consequence may ensue that
nearly half the succeeding clauses will, in
turn, have to be surrendered and re-cast, to
bring them into correspondence with the
alteration in the earlier one. In addition to
this, he will have to submit to the introduc-
tion of whole sheaves of new clauses and
new provisions, to enable the voter who
may, at election-time, be distant from the
electorate in which he is enrolled, to exercise
the franchise. Already there have been
submitted, for pre-consideration by the
Assembly, whole foolscap pages of fresh
clauses, designed to meet those requirements,
and these the N.S.W. Premier will either
have to swallow with as little grimace as pos-
sible, or to supplant by amendments of his own
to the same effect. His Bill, in short, is so
crude, so ill-considered, that scarcely any part
of it is likely to be accepted in its present
form ; and,- considering the amount of time
which has already been consumed in the
endeavour to knock the few opening lines
into some sort of shape, it seems improbable
that the 151 clauses which the measure
comprises can be dealt with without exhaust-
ing the whole session, and the patience and
endurance of the Legislature as well.
V .'\v v\ # # •
yParkee’much be-trumpeted Electoral Bill
is; in, truth',-a sorry jumble. It embodies no
dbmqeratic progression, save that which
Mr. Traill’s Bill would, if passed in the last
Parliament, have given in a direct and
simple fashion. ' Registration is indeed pro-
vided,- but in so curious a fashion that, in
place of affording assurance of a large
popular vote, 1 it would operate so as to dis-
franchise a large proportion of persons who
under the existing system have always
exercised the right of voting. Besides that,
the whole Scheme is so entangled with
another measure, the Redistribution of
Seats Bill, which has not yet even been seen
by members of the Assembly, that the one
will be useless without the other ; and mem-
bers already complain that while dealing
with the Bill in hand, they cannot really
appreciate the full effect of anything they
may determine. Beyond these features, the
draft itself is a mass of confused and
involved incongruities—a jumble of- compli-
cated machinery, , every wheel of which
seems likely to require remodelling and
readjustment in order to adapt it to altera-
tions which must necessarily be made to
repair the defective action of the parts first
dealt with, and to fill up the vacancies where
important functions have not been provided
for.
# # #
Were it the case that this pretentious Bill
embodied a number of really important and
novel principles' * the multiplicity of its
clauses and the intricacy -of its text might
be condoned, and even justified. But in view
of thq fact that all tins wilderness of words
is expended to effect a minimum quantity of
structural change in the electoral system of
the province, it is no wonder that discontent
swells. The science of electoral reproseata-
tion is fairly reasoned out, but its practical
application has yet nowhere made consider-
able advance. The system which has during
the past 20 years prevailed in New South
Wales has been an exceedingly primitive
one. After every general election the press
partizans of every shade of opinion make it
a custom to subject the results to an analysis,
more or less rough and ready. Their con-
clusions never by any chance agree m any
single respect save one, namely, that the
representation has scarcely any real corres-
pondence with the intention of the electors.
In one constituency members are returned
who have received only a minority of the
votes polled. In others a small preponderance
of votes enables a majority to send to Parlia-
ment three and four members, while a
minority numbering nearly as many as the
majority are altogether unrepresented.
Again, the ablest public men, to whom tens
of thousands of electors would gladly give
their suffrage, are liable to be excluded from
Parliament altogether, because one particular
constituency, in which the election is timed
among the latest, prefers some hero of the
pump and town-clock order. Everyone
of these is a genuine defect, and there is
not one which is irreparable, or for which
some effectual remedy has not been indicated
by impartial and philosophic investigators.
Yet, despite the immense pretensions of the
New South Wales Premier as to his promised
“Comprehensive Bill” not one of these
defects has been grappled with by its pro-
visions.
# * *
The Bill’s bulk is expanded by trumpery
provisions to permit of electors who shift
from Balmain to Ultimo, still exercising the
franchise, and in re-enacting, sometimes in a
less efficient fashion, conditions which already
exist in the law which the new one is
to repeal and replace. Every provision
which is novel in this province has already
found a place in the statute-book of some
other, and is simply borrowed therefrom
by grand old Prigster Parkes. There is
consequently in this draft Bill no feature
which will entitle its author to claim credit
either for wide scope of knowledge,
or for the courage of an originator.
The scheme is hopeless and incurable chaos
from first to last, and it would probably,
therefore, save much valuable time to at
once throw back the Bill to its author with
injunctions to bring in another decently
framed. And if such a course should involve
the displacement of the Ministry responsible
for so flagrant an imposition on the people
and Parliament of New South Wales, it will
matter very little. The Electoral Bill of
next Ministry must be better, for the suffi-
cient reason that it can’t be worse.

ANOTHER “HOLY COAT.”
London, August 15. —The Roman Catholics of Argen-
teuil, near Versailles, intend to exhibit a “ Holy Coat ” on
the 16th instant, notwithstanding' that the Pope has
declared that the “Holy Coat” of Treves is the only
genuine one.— Cablegram.
On the small but ancient and charmingly
situated city of Treves, on the Moselle, there is
at the present moment converging a huge army
made up of recruits of all lands and languages.
A peculiar feature about this advancing host is
that room is found in its ranks not alone for
females, but for the lame, the halt and the
blind, as well as the young and the old of both
sexes. They are pilgrims bent on viewing the
coat worn by the Saviour of mankind on the
eventful Friday morning nineteen centuries
ago, when the rabble, with the permission of
the Roman authorities, crucified the man whose
advanced socialism, in religious as well as in
secular matters, was offensive in their eyes.
All that is now known of Jesus of Nazareth
is contained in the four canonical gospels.
These four were chosen out of about 50 by the
Council of Nice in the early part of the fourth
century. The Council consisted of 318 bishops,
most of whom could not read. Indeed,
B alin us, one of their number, observed that,
with the exception of two, they were “ simple,
illiterate creatures.” It is impossible to say
now how the assembled divines chose the four
true accounts and condemned the false 46. It is
recorded, however, that the whole 50 were put
under the table, and that the present quartette
—Matthew, Mark, Luke and John —at once
jumped on -the table. This is probably un-
trustworthy.
* # *
Towards the end of the third century St.
Helena, the mother of that Constantine who
saw the fiery cross in the sky, became a Chris-
tian, as well as her son, and established a
reputation for piety. To attain such a reputa-
tion in those days does not appear to have been
so difficult as in these. Among other actions
in favour of her new creed was a journey made
by her to Jerusalem for the double purpose of
discovering the sepulchre of the Saviour as well
as the cross on which HE suffered. She found
both. But she found much more. The astute
people of Jerusalem, in view of what, without
irreverence, might be called the Western “run
on relics,” were not backward in finding them
to order. With a reverential spirit that did
her credit, St. Helena wished to discover if any
of the garments worn by the Crucified on
Calvary were still preserved. It was quickly
found that many of them (after a lapse of 300
years) were in a fair state of preservation. In
fait, so many were produced that a fresh diffi-
culty at once arose. It was hard to say with
certainty which were the true ones. That all
could be genuine was out of the question, unless
on the blasphemous assumption that the Con-
demned was in business, and carried his stock
to the place of execution. At last St. Helena,
guided no doubt by supernatural advice, chose
a seamless coat as the one worn on the cross.
It is this coat that is preserved in the Cathedral
of Treves—it is to see it that pilgrims in mil-
lions are now on their way across mountains,
continents and oceans.
This is the place for a few words concerning
relics in general before returning to the Holy
Coat of Treves. They are common to all
religions and to all nations. They satisfy a
deep-seated craving in the human mind— -a
craving which, kept within legitimate bounds,
is highly creditable to humanity. But it never
has been, is, or will be kept within legitimate
bounds. At Mecca is preserved the stone whose
eventful history was told to Abraham by an
angel. The stone might be removed and
another substituted, but the only result would
be a probably greater number of pilgrims and
a probably higher percentage of cures. So
with Buddha's tooth at Ceylon. It might be
stolen or ground to powder, as it once was,
but there is little doubt that a fresh tooth
would be found possessing all the charac-
teristics of its predecessor. When millions
of Buddhists demand a grinder as a relic of
Gaudama, it is certain that a grinder will be
found for them. The Romans exhibited frag-
ments of the good sl\ip Argo, which bore the
apocryphal Jasor and his apocryphal comrades
on their eventful but problematical voyage. In
the Epistle to the Hebrews, Paul speaks of the
Holy of Holies, which contained ‘ ‘ the golden
censer and the ark of the covenant overlaid
round about with gold, wherein was the golden
pot that had manna, and Aaron’s rod that
budded.” But when the Roman, Pompey, sacri-
legiously stood where none but the High Priest
had previously presumed to enter, he found-
nothing.
* # #
The Saxon monarch, Athelstan, presented
many powerful relics to the monastery at
Exeter—among others, the candle lighted by
the angel of the Lord in Christ’s tomb, the
burning bush from which Jehovah spake to
Moses, and one of the stones used in the
martyrdom of St. Stephen. Edward the
Confessor, of England, and Louis IX., of
France, were likewise great collectors and
generous donors of the upper and lower ex-
tremities of long-departed saints. Why any
physical or mental ailments should have been
permitted to exist in European countries, con-
sidering the ease with which they might be
cured by a visit to the nearest shrine, has never
been explained. Still, it was reserved for the
Crusaders to bear the markets by the relics
sent West in shiploads after the sack of
Jerusalem, at the beginning of the 13th cen-
tury. From Constantinople to Cadiz there was
such a boom in bones, that even the smallest
village shrine could boast of tibise or fibuke
whose former owner had long ceased to have
any further use for them. A liberal discount
was allowed to families and schools, until
the West became a repository for the articula-
tions of the East. Bearing in mind the character
of the people who swarmed to the Crusades,
when their native lands were becoming too cir-
cumscribed for their enterprise, the ungenerous
suspicion quickly arose that most of the relics
sent from Palestine had been obtained from the
nearest church-yards.
* # #
The people of to-day are too apt to assume in
their arrogance that their ancestors of the 12th
and 13th centuries were a good deal behind the
present times. In many things they un-
doubtedly may have been ; but it is question-
able whether the smartest trader of the present
would have had so much to boast of when it
came to a bargain for a consignment of skulls.
It would be too much to suppose that no
mistakes were made in the relics before the
Reformation came and introduced a chronic
slackness into the business. Many replicas
were sold, so that while a German church re-
joiced in the possession of a whole skeleton,
another skeleton of the same person might be
found curing congenital infirmities on the other
side of the Rhine. Perhaps the most familiar
case is that of the two crowns of thorns, one of
which was secured by a certain monastery, while
a neighbouring establishment obtained the
other. That both were genuine was so obviously
improbable that many a head was broken in the
quarrel as to which was the true one—a
question that remains undecided to this day.
How it has come about that no rival coat to the
one at Treves has secured a footing in religious
circles [since this was written there has
been received the cablegram which appears
above], or that no further garments were dis-
covered when the success of the latter was
assured, is not very plain. By such remissness
an opportunity was lost which is not likely to
recur unless, indeed, Baron Hirscii and his co-
religionists succeed in forming colonies on the
Jordan, when, from the proverbial ingenuity
of the Jewish people and their acquaintance
with the clothes-line in all its branches, further
discoveries may be anticipated with confidence.
Having said so much of relics in general it is
time to return to the subject of the Holy Coat
of Treves.
# # «S
We have no record of the number of pilgrims
who went to view this memento when it was
exposed a few years ago. But, so far back as
184-1, no fewer than a million and a-half of
people visited the shrine on the occasion of that
year’s pilgrimage. Now that the means of
communication have been so multiplied all the
world over it may well be that an equal, or even
greater, number will take advantage of the pre-
sent opportunity. At the same time the spread
of scepticism has more than kept pace with the
spread of railways and of shipbuilding. 1 11
fact, it would not be too much to say that every
fresh locomotive or telegraph-line heralds an
addition to the ranks of secularism. It IS-
therefore, with some surprise we learn that
already thousands of Americans are on their
way to Treves. If one could be certain that the
pork-merchants of Chicago, the lobbyists o!
Washington, or the contractors and civil ser-
vants of Canada would return new men, the
surprise would quickly give way to satisfaction.
Still, it is to lie feared that on the North
American continent, as elsewhere, the Old
Adam finds too congenial a shelter in mens
hearts to be banished by the sight of a coat
whose chief characteristic appears to be the
absence of seams. Besides, if the Yankees am
Canadians wish to inspect relics, they need not
go far from home. In Mexico and in South
America the followers of Cortez and Rizahi-o
took care to supply the various churches "dn


relics that had seen much service and effected
many miracles in distant Spain. Many of these
souvenirs had done good work against the
Moors, and might fairly be warranted to keep
up in the New World the reputation they had
acquired in the Old. It is probable that the
Incas, with many mementoes of their own holy
men, would not care to sell their country for
boxes of foreign vertebrae. But the far-seeing
Spaniards brought blunderbusses as well as
bones ; and the fact is now beyond dispute that
a relic with a musket is worth the contents of
a vault with bows-and-arrows.
* * *
So far as Australia is concerned, it may
be asserted with considerable confidence
that no movement on either a small or
large scale will be made in the direc-
tion of visiting Treves. A few Australians
who happen to be in Europe may be tempted
by curiosity to mingle with the crowd, and a
few may even be induced to attend from pious
motives. But the State School system has done
its work. Secular education and a Holy Coat
are a badly-yoked couple and decline to go
together in harness. This big Island of ours
views with gentle cynicism everything in the
relic line, whether it be the arm of an anchorite
of the uniform of a prince. Big as Australia is
there is no room in it for fairies, ghosts, saints,
regalia, or relics. In fact, there is little room in
it even for idle clergy. Already the churches
are demonstratively forsaken by men, and
nearly so by women and children. A constant
dribble of ecclesiastics has to be kept up from
the other side of the world, as the material for
their manufacture is almost entirely absent
among us. The idea of a born Australian
appearing at Treves to inspect the Holy Coat
is too grotesque to be dwelt upon without a
generously-capacious smile.
* * *
It is not, however, the religious world
alone that invites derision by its faith in
the authenticity and virtues of holy garments
and holy bones. There are secular as well as
sacerdotal relics. The crowns, sceptres, regalia,
coronets, robes, garters, pumps, and breeches
appertaining to monarchy and aristocracy are
as vulgar in conception and as potent for mis-
chief as the contents of all the saintly sarco-
phagi of the old world. They are relics of a
barbarous past when violence and wrong held
undisputed sway—when the Western European
nations, like the Russians of a few years ago,
consisted of but two classes, masters and slaves.
Nor, although daily falling into disrepute, have
these tawdry insignia yet wholly lost their
potency for evil. Millions still reverence or
affect to reverence them, and their baneful
influence has reached even far Australia.
Under their protection there has grown up
amongst us a class of frowsy upstarts whose
ignoble ambition it is to perpetuate, in new
lands, the titular absurdities of old ones.
Again, our lawbooks are relics, not alone of
mummery, but of cruelty. On the Statute
Books of every Australian state at the present
moment are laws which are daily put into
execution, and which would libel a society of
Thugs. It was but last week that, at Bathurst,
a couple of men, made presumably in the image
of Gon, were ordered to be bound while a. large
portion of their trunks were being skinned.
After a month or so, when nature had supplied
fresh cuticle, it was to be again removed by a
succession of blows, and so on till one wretch
had been tortured twice and the other three
times. Yet the lawmakers and the journals
that uphold this vivisection have the cool
audacity to prate about Siberian cruelty or
Oriental insensibility.
Widows and the State.
There is a mixture of good and bad in Mr.
Ninian Melville’s proposal to impose a tax on
every ton of coal raised in New South W ales,
to be applied in relieving the families of men
killed in coal-mines. Every extensive mining
accident creates a widespread feeling of public
sympathy, and provokes a considerable amount
of more or less ostentatious alms-giving. The
women and children whom the calamity robs of
their bread-winners are generally in some way
provided for by public subscription. They
become the pensioners of a charity fund. This
is a good thing in so far as a fund is brought
into existence for the purpose ; it is objection-
able in so far as the fund is tainted with what-
ever of humiliation is implied by the so-called
charity. The best feature of the proposed
legislation is that, while not abolishing the pro-
vision for those bereaved, it would put it on a
different footing. The widows and the father-
less would be fed, but not with the bread of
charity. Whatever help was given them they
would take not as a matter of grace, but as a
matter of right. The wife of John Jones,
deceased coal-hewer, might collect her monthly
dues from the public treasury with as indepen-
dent a spirit and as high a head as the daintiest
civil servant drawing his salary, or a retired
Chief Justice his pension.
# # *
Another advantage of the measure would be
the doing away with unequal and spasmodic
distribution. At present the amount of assist-
ance given to any individual depends entirely
upon the circumstances of the particular acci-
dent that necessitates the assistance. The
woman whose husband is killed in a great catas-
trophe like the Bulli explosion may find herself
in receipt of a little income for life, while, if he
had been the solitary victim of a fall of coal,
the most she could expect would be a small
contribution to relieve her immediate distress.
And yet her wants arq none the less pressing
when she has no companions in misfortune than
if every woman in the district had been made a
widow at the same moment. Public charity
never proceeds on rational grounds. The
motive that should actuate anyone in contribut-
ing to a relief-fund is that certain individuals in
want of food and clothes have no means of
getting them. That motive is never sufficient
to produce much result. The public cannot be
roused to enthusiasm by the mere intel-
ligence that some uninteresting individuals
a hundred miles away are hungry and
ragged. They want stirring. Let a hun-
dred men be blown into eternity without
a moment’s warning, and you get the necessary
sensation. Subscription lists can be circulated
at once, and they will be filled. People give
their money, not because so many women and
children have lost their husbands and fathers
and been rendered destitute, but because the
husbands and fathers departed this life to a
sufficiently dramatic accompaniment. To adopt
Melville’s resolution would be to change this.
The distribution of the relief-fund would pro-
ceed on the ground that the death of a bread-
winner had made relief necessary, not that the
circumstances of the death were exciting
enough to supply the evening papers with a
page of sensational cross-headings.
* * *
But the weakness of the proposal is that it
does not go far enough. It still indirectly
recognises the fallacious distinction between two
classes of the helplessly destitute as objects of
public concern—between those who owe their
unfortunate position to fatal accident, and those
who have come to grief in any other way. No
such distinction can logically be drawn. If it
is a proper and a praiseworthy thing to make
public provision for the widow and the orphan
of any man who may be killed by an explosion
of fire-damp, there can be no valid reason for
withholding the same relief from the family of
the man who comes to his death by con-
sumption or typhoid. The former case
is the one that attracts public attention
and sympathy. The public mind is always
open to be moved by startling tragedy
in actual life or on the stage. It appeals to the
dullest imagination. And yet perhaps the most
pitiable case is the commonest, where the
breadwinner is struck down by mortal disease,
and dies after a lingering illness, which leaves
those dependent on him not only without means
of support, but overwhelmed with hopeless
debt.
* * *
The question for the legislature is whether
the weak and helpless have any claim against
the community at large which the community
is willing frankly to recognise and meet. If so,
the action taken should be not piecemeal, bvit
comprehensive and thorough. But if public
opinion is not yet ripe for that, then I he Bulle-
tin will welcome even a fragmentary instal-
ment. The step once taken, will never be
retraced. It is the direction in which we shall
march boldly in the future, when the eyes of
the race are opened to see that even as a mere
matter of business it will pay the State to take
under its charge the weaklings —children too
young to earn their bread, and old men whose
earning days are over—and the women, for
whom the race has other work to do.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Chinaman and the Nigger.
The other evening, when Parkes’ new Elec-
toral Bill rose like a midnight spectre in the
N.S.W. Assembly, Gar van arose, armed with
an inspiration. He wanted to know particularly
whether Parkes had provided a vote for the
Australian aboriginal; and following him came
Houghton, who went the whole legislative hog
by demanding that the suffrage should be
granted to the naturalised Buddhist, so that
the yellow man might be an elector and a
brother, and one Chinaman might have one
vote. So far as the aboriginal was concerned,
Sir Henry viewed the proposition with favour,
but he drew the line at the Buddhist. The
old, coloured owner of the soil has enjoyed a
vote in the past under certain conditions, and
Parkes declined to tear the ballot-paper away
from the last wrecks of a decaying race. To
disfranchise him would be “ a lasting disgrace
to this democratic land, and, in his mind’s eye,
the old man evidently saw a tearful picture of
the native shivering in a tree on the summits of
a thousand hills, a broken-down black Avreck,
damp, naked and insolvent, but hanging on to
his vote as the one consolation that remained
to him on earth. Sir Henry seldom shows
to better advantage than when he is looking
after a distressed female, or propping up a
dying race, or shedding the tear of sensibility
over bones, and poems, and ruins, and sodden
graves, and similar relics; but even he might
have been puzzled to tell Avhat use a vote is
to an aboriginal, and why it would be a dis-
grace to any democratic country if he hadn’t one.
A vote is a means whereby a citizen expresses
his independent opinion on public matteis, and
if he won’t and can’t express an independent
opinion, then he ought not to have a vote, foi
lie only uses it as somebody else’s dummy, and
resurrects the old plural-voting iniquity once
more. The blackfellow has no opinion worth
mentioning, but that difficulty could be got
over, seeing that any number of white men are
in the same situation; the one hopeless
obstacle is that, as soon as he learns anything
of civilisation, he gives up being independent
then and for ever. It is his pride and joy to be
Mr Hangar’s blackfellow, or Jack Hamil-
ton’s nigger, or Billy Rutledge’s aboriginal;
the idea°of being his own aboriginal never enters
his head. His constant desire is to have a
patron who will keep him in tobacco and occa-
sional drinks, and he will vote for his patron
just as every other man will vote for the party
which fills his political programme. The
arrangement suits both parties concerned, ihe
big landowner who owns the nigger is the same
landowner who wants to own the white man,
but in default of the white man the nigger-
provided he has a vote—does almost as well.
Nobody can own the nigger except the land-
owner, for the coloured gentleman always gives
his allegiance to the person avlio lends him a
tree to roost under, and therefore the
arrangement is equally good for the
big capitalist and the undressed native.
But it is good for no one else. !No
amount of pathos can get over this obstacle
—the blackfellow doesn’t want to be an inde-
pendent elector, and won’t be one on any terms.
Even a democratic country doesn’t give the
suffrage to infants and horses, for such a pro-
ceeding would only give a plural vote to the
infant’s male parent and to the man who drives
the horse ; and the aboriginal occupies precisely
the same situation. An adult nigger without a
vote is an anomaly in a free country, and so is
an adult Chinaman in the same situation : but
the anomaly can’t be helped, and Mr-
Houghton’s attempt to draw a parallel between
the naturalised German and the naturalised
Mongol or the native-born black, is supreme
folly. The naturalised German can become an
Australian citizen in all essentials of citizen-
ship ; the Mongol and the nigger remain
Mongols and niggers to the bitter end. More-
over the picture of these forlorn pilgrims pining
for their lost suffrages and refusing to be com-
forted is too thin. The nigger doesn’t want a
vote, apart from the question of rum and
tobacco, any more than the black snake wants
a new hat; he has no idea—of his own —what
to do with it; and he has no desire to become a
legislator, and would much prefer being a
policeman on account of the club and the
uniform. And, anyhow, a ballot-box is a hard
substance with which to console a dying race,
and if the nigger is dying it is more to the point
to let him down easy with grub and blankets
and tobacco. And as for the Mongol, the pro-
posal to give a vote to the poll-taxed heathen
who is about to be kicked out may be theoretical
justice, but as he won’t remain long enough to
enjoy it, the proceeding is superfluous and
various other things as well.
-
The Lost Bore.
Alfred Allen, poet, M.L.A. of Paddington
(N.S. W.), was visited the other day by an
inspiration. He conceives that a legislator is
paid for attending Parliament, arid therefore
his screw should be stopped on those nights
when he isn’t present. This looks, on the face
of it, a reasonable proposition, but it won’t
bear inspection, and nobody, except Alfred
Allen, could have struck such a piece of weird
and solemn foolery. For, in the first place, a
member is not paid for his attendance ; he is
paid partly to legislate and partly to block
other people’s legislation, and he must be
judged entirely by results. The mere tact that
a man has sat hard down in the House all
through a session of six months is not, of neces-
sity, any more use to the country than if he had
sat on damp grass for 60 years in an uninhabited
land. If a man appears once in a year or so
with a noble and convincing idea to enunciate,
he is of more service than Alfred Allen
ever will be, seeing that he merely talks
till he takes root, and never has any
ideas at all. Mr. Allen has slopped over
for years, with a ceaseless flow of thin, washy
platitudes, and yet George Reid, in his single
speech on the necessity for law-reform in Aus-
tralia, did more real work than the other man
could do if he lived to be the Last Man of all,
and made continuous orations all the time. The
House, in fact, wants to pay some men to be
present every night, and some other men to
keep away perpetually, and Mr. Allen is one
of the other men. It is impossible to
run Parliament on Sunday-school bun-struggle
principles. If it insisted on all the bores being
present all the time it would only be jawed to
death. If it insisted on the good men being
present all the time they would be technically
present but practically absent; in other words,
they would sign the roll, and then fly to the
refreshment-room to escape the bores who had
been rallied up by Act of Parliament. The
scheme might work in a silent Parliament
where every member merely sent in his speech
to Hansard, and offered no audible observations.
Or again, it might work in a Parliament run on
the pantomimic principle of the new French
worldless play of Pierrot and Pierrette, if such
a thing could be devised. Then there would be no
speeches at all, either verbal or printed, but
each senator on rising would hang a card on his
front button, explaining in large print the sub-
ject which he wanted to discuss, and would
express himself by dumb show and gesticula-
tion, and by the indignant firing out of his arms
and legs in various directions, and by his per-
spiration, and the glare in his sinister eye, and
the standing up of his hair, like the quills of
the indignant porcupine. Or, again, as a last
alternative, the House might allow every
member to make a speech on his first appear-
ance, and then if he proved a confirmed and
incurable bore it could briefly cork him up, and
make him confine himself to mere voting for
ever afterwards, on the ground that he had been
sampled and had proved a failure. On any of
these three principles it would be feasible to
compel the constant attendance of all members,
but not otherwise. There are about 98 hard,
irredeemable nuisances in the New South Wales
Legislature, and when they appear the windows
of Heaven are opened and the great deep of
bosh is broken up, and it rains ineffable crazy -
ness day and night. And if they were all there
constantly, and the senate never got a rest,
their blood would be upon their own heads.

“ Unearned Increment.”
A workingman’s wife, writing to a Sydney
paper, tells how she and a friend were swindled
by a couple of the financial dodges to which
the law gives the dense shelter of its silence.
Her friend, about to marry, put down £35
towards buying a little cottage and land, and
engaged to pay 12s. 6d. per week until the
balance of a fixed amount was extinguished.
He paid away regularly for 18 months, and was
then legally ordered to clear out, as the man
who sold him the property had gone insolvent,
and the official assignee had taken over all
his property, including the house and
land. That is a story you often hear.
A man able to rent a “flash” office in
Sydney or Melbourne may start as a landed
proprietor any day and do business with the
uninstructed and credulous public. The legend,
“Caveat Emptor,” is decipherable over every
commercial door, and is answer in full to all
ordinary complaints. The purchaser of land or
of a house should make sure of his title, and if
he pays his money without doing so he must
take the risk. Thus is the question settled on
the side of the buyer. The seller has, however,
still to be dealt with. “ Caveat Emptor ” is,
in his respect, a mere license to cheat. The
law does not formally ratify this license. Now
and again it condemns the whole thing. But
what it should do, not now and again, but
always, is to make it a criminal offence, punish-
able by penal servitude, for any man to sell
what he does not fully own. The workingman’s
wife also puts forward the grievance that, after
paying for a certain time into a society, she
loses all because she had fallen into arrears.
There is a world of pathos in that statement.
The working classes are literally fleeced by
individuals and companies who calculate on the
incidence of calamities among weekly wage*
earners—want of employment, or sickness, < r
accident—intervening as the years go by, and
leading to the confiscation of the payments
made. The Legislature has here a field of rank
imposture to attack. Under the guise of
encouraging thrift there exist persons, a main
element of whose income is the payments made
by wage-earners during the period of their em-
ployment, and forfeited by them afterwards on
account of non-employment or of sickness or of
some other distress beyond control. There is
plenty of unearned increment apart from that
of land.

A Comprehensive Clause.
When the Police Offences Act Amendment Bill
came up for consideration in the Victorian
Council, Hon. James Service rose to demand
the insertion of this brief but comprehensive
clause :
Where any person is accused of bein'' an idle or dis-
orderly person on the ground that he has no visible
lawful means or insufficient lawful means of support, the
fact that he can produce or prove that he possesses
money or property shall not be taken into account in
deciding the charge against such person unless he is able
to show that he honestly obtained such money or pro-
perty.
Truly the old man of Property who sketched
out that clause was wise in his day and genera-
tion. When the modern “ cop,” acting in the
interests of Capital, comes across anybody who
is hungry, or ragged, or homeless, or out of
work, he is duly authorised to arrest him for
having no money and no food and no place to
sleep in. . He can be sent to prison for 12
months for having no cash about him, though
if he were accused of pounding his wife instead
of being hard-up, he would only get seven days.
The law takes no account of why he is hard up;
if it were properly administered in all its
pristine beauty it would lead to the arrest of
ship-wrecked sailors, and the sufferers by the
Melbourne floods, and all poor people who are
burnt out and have lost their clothes and their
furniture. There is one weak point about this
ancient statute, and only one—on all other
points it is as hard as cast-iron or frozen brass.
When a man is arrested for having no money,
and proves in coui’t that he really has money,
and that the indictment is a lie and the arrest-
ing constable an ass, he is generally allowed
to go —reluctantly, it is true, and with a
solemn warning not to do it any more,
but still he is allowed to go. This
is the matter which the Victorian Upper
House desires to remedy. The proposi-
tion of Mr. Service simply means that when a
man is charged with having no cash, and he
produces the cash and thereby gives the lie to
the whole accusation, he shall be sent to gaol
for having no cash all the same, on the off-
chance that the property was dishonestly
acquired. The law won’t attempt to prove that
it was dishonestly acquired —it will be author •>
ised to take the dishonesty for granted, unless
the prisoner can prove the contrary. If the
property—whatever it is—has been in his
possession for many years, and he can’t in-
stantly produce the man from whom he ob-
tained it, he will go to prison there and then.
He will get the customary three months, partly
for not having any assets when he ought
to have them, and partly for having
assets when it is presumed without any
evidence at all —that he ought not tb have them.
It is a clause which covers everything and rakes
in everybody, and the old capitalists of the
Upper House seem to have accepted the situa-
tion cheerfully. At least, nobody threw' any-
thing at the bloated landlord who proposed
this atrocious legal outrage, and nobody cast
him down the front steps, and no paper de-
manded his resignation as an incurable lunatic,
and he still flourishes and helps to make laws
for the Victorian democracy.

If Parkes’ Electoral Bill becomes law after
proper democratic amendments, The Bulle-
tin people will vote for the old man next
election—provided they have a vote in his
electorate. Several months ago, this paper
cordially invited Sir Henry to introduce a
measure providing that no member shall lie
elected to the New South Wales Assembly
unless he receives an absolute majority of the
votes polled, and in cases where no candidate
receives such a majority, the matter to be;
decided by a second ballot. It also promised
that if he did bring in and pass that measure,
The Bulletin would vote for the aged poet at
the first opportunity under the new system.
Possibly this lavish offer roused Parkes up, for
the required proviso appears in his Electoral
Bill, and if that document gets through safely
Sir Henry will receive more votes than he
expected next polling day. Possibly these
votes wdll pull him through, where he would
otherwise have been defeated, but The
Bulletin cordially trusts they may not.
The paper will blast Parkes with
its accustomed vigour both before and after
the election, and its sentiments tqwards
him will undergo no change. It will continue
to regard his poetry as hogwash of the worst
description, and to consider him a public fraud
of the first water, and it will still hold the fixed
opinion that his hair ought to be cut, and that
he wants a clean shave. It will look upon him
through all the ages of futurity as a person
with a shifty eye and an unreliable 1.0. U. But
if his Bill passes in its present form it will do
its best to give him the votes already men-
tioned, and it trusts that he wdll feel aggravated
at getting them. The Bulletin’s moral pro-
missory note has always been redeemed at
maturity, and if the old man only gets two sup-
porters altogether at the next election he will
know by this intimation where they came from.
This offer holds good under all circumstances,
and even if the great Hi-Ham is unseated pre-
maturely for insolvency, cannibalism, or con-
spiracy with a Chinaman, so long as he presents
himself on polling-day it makes no difference.

“ Loins.”
This is the history of the life of a once robust people
now scourged hy Protection written in blood, and its
aarlands of national life changed to the gloomy trappings
of national death.—Sydney E. News.
The wild, sad song of John Haynes —it must
1)0 John, for no other individual could be so
loose in his facts and so mad in his poetry—
thus bursts forth again in Sydney E. News,
about the decline and fall of Victoria under the
baneful influences of Protection. Also, it must
be Haynes some more because the writer
evidently doesn’t know that there are any other
places in the world except New South Wales
and Victoria, and he isn’t sure about Victoria.
The burden and lamentation of this little man
howling'in the wilderness is just this—owing to
Protection people don’t marry in Victoria, they
have few children, and they die off hurriedly,
while in New South Wales owing to Foreign-
trade they marry like blazes, and have lots of
children, and live to a green old age. “ Those
who are born wither like fragile flowers into
the grave ” moans tins prophet of evil, and
what became of those that are not born he
doesn’t mention. And again he breaks forth
in this awful manner :
Taken together the colony enjoying Protection which
was to make the people happy and prosperous was beaten
•’ y the ITeetrade colony by product from the loins of the
people by 07,804 souls in a run of only 13 years.
John always was great on the subject of
“ loins,” and the expression recalls the bright
days of the old, vanished past. And we pre-
sume it would be no good mentioning to John,
or to the News, that Victoria is ahead in the
matter of marriages per thousand of the popu-
lation, after all, and that Protectionist Queens-
land beats the New South Wales record by a
tremendous percentage. Also, it would be no
use at all to mention that in the matter of births
Queensland and W.A. both leave the Foreign-
trade Cornstalk in the rear ; and that in Maori-
land and S.A.—Protection notwithstanding—
the population doesn’t die off nearly so fast as
it does in the land of Botany Bay; and that,
in the natural increase of population, Maori-
land, which isn’t Freetrade by any means,
wipes out the whole lot. It is the thinly-
peopled country which shows best in the vital
statistics, and Protection has no more to do
with it than the transit of Venus has with the
price of salt fish. And, if people don’t die
much in New South Wales it is possibly because
New South Wales isn’t a good and pleasant
place to die in. Possibly the sight of Haynes
i.browing poetry off his chest in this awesome
manner has something to do with it; possibly
they are scared in their declining years by
John’s observations about “loins;” possibly it
is something else—goodness only knows what.
Anyhow, it doesn’t matter.
The 3rd clause in the original draft of Attorney-
General Simpson’s Criminal Law and Evidence
Amendment Bill, now before the N.S. W. Legis-
lative Council, recalls the innovation made by
Sir Alfred Stephen at the first trial of Henry
Louis Bertrand —an innovation which more
than all the other vexed points in the case
tended to save that individual’s neck. After
22 hours’ deliberation, without agreement, Sir
Alfred, the presiding Judge, at that time Chief
J ustice, discharged the jury and remanded the
prisoner. When, on a subsequent trial, Ber-
trand was found guilty, Sir (then Mr.) Julian
SALOMONseontended that Sir Alfred’s discharge
was had in law on the ground that the jury should
not have been released except on a medical cer-
tificate testifying that they could not go on
further. He contended that if a Judge could
discharge after 21 or 22 hours he could do
so after one hour, or any time he choose.
Although Bertrand was finally found
guilty, this contention of Salomons’ affected
the public mind and operated actively to post-
pone the death-penalty. Afterwards it was
fixed that a Judge could not discharge a jury
until after 12 hours’ inconclusive consultation,
and it is this practice which Mr. Simpson’s 3rd
clause originally proposed to abolish. He ex-
punged it, however, after reflection, and thus
the free discretion Sir Alfred presumed to
e.xercise over a-quarter of a century ago will
continue to be limited by law.
A S.M. Herald correspondent says that union-
ism has injured labour because “ those who
possess the capital to live without having labour
done, or doing it themselves for a livelihood,
will not invest their money, or spend it only as
it pleases themselves,” and from this remark-
able premise deduces the conclusion that the
lowering of wages would result in increased
opportunities for labour. For instance :
“ Some hundreds of landlords would he able to
have painting done if it was more reasonable.”
The gentleman’s reasoning is even more extra-
ordinary than his grammar. In the first place,
capital held out of use ceases primarily to he
capital, eventually to have any existence, simply
because it can only be replenished when used
productively hy labour. Then, the lowering of
wages would not necessarily produce reduction
in the price of commodities, hut would certainly
result in an increase of profits and a consequent
increase in the luxury of idlers and in the
number of those who are drones hy choice.
Lastly, if an approximation to starvation wages
would give “thousands of landlords” an
opportunity to “ have painting done,” a closer
approach hy the workman to the ohtainal of
ilie full results of his toil would enable millions
of wage-earners also to have “a little painting
done.” Higher wages mean a higher standard
of living, therefore, an increased expenditure,
consequently, a greater demand for labour.
Lower wages mean precisely the reverse. The
man who writes to Tory journals recommending
his fellows to accept low pay, is, despite his bad
grammar, too evidently a bogus toiler.
It was ex-Attorney-General Wrtxon who re-
solved the Victorian Parliament to strike out
the term, “ Commonwealth ” from the Federa-
tion Bill. It wasn’t his great speech that did
it, for the speech fell comparatively flat ; the
peroration settled the business. “ What,” he
demanded, in tones of woe and thunder, “ would
people think in Great Britain if Gladstone and
the Irish Party were to insist not only on
having Home Rule in Ireland, but on calling
the newly-enfranchised .State ‘ the Common-
wealth of I reland ?’ ” Thai paralysed the House,
and “Commonwealth” was struck out there
and then. Everybody was floored on the spot.
Not one member had ever looked at the matter
in that light before. The Legislature fell down
in a horror-stricken heap in the face of this
argument. And yet, after all, wdiat would
people think if the Commonwealth of Ireland
were started to-morrow ? Nine-tenths of them
wouldn’t think at all, because they had never
learned how to do it. The other tenth w r ould
think about their own business just as usual,
and wouldn’t mind whether Ireland was a
Commonwealth or not. There would be no row
or convulsion of any kind. Beer wouldn’t go
up. Nothing would happen. Nobody would
be killed. That is The Bulletin’s idea of
what people would think about the Irish
Commonwealth. What Wrixon thinks they
would think isn’t mentioned. That brilliant
loyalist merely threw up his hands in horror, and
in the name of all the dead kings that continu-
ally howl in Sheol, what are they expected to
think in such a case ? The whole thing reminds
us very much of another question that another
fool asked some 70 years ago or more. He
wanted to know what people would think of
being carried along in a train at the rate of 20
miles an hour. And all the people think is that
20 miles an hour is hideously slow. Meantime,
“ common-poverty ” is the title for Ireland,
viewed how you like.
For the first time in the Queensland Parliament
the Northern members are going to vote as
a solid bunch, the subject of their advocacy
being Griffith’s three-pronged division of the
colony into provinces as a substitute for com-
plete Separation. This really means apparent
victory for the Separatists, the price of the
Northern support being Griffith’s promise
that, if the Southern bunches should succeed in
casting out the Bill, he will himself go the
whole hog and no longer oppose Knutsford’s
action in the Separation matter. So, apparently,
if the Northerners win now, they lose to win
hereafter ; if they lose now, they win hereafter
all the same. We have italicised apparently.
Griffith was long known as “ Slippery Sam,”
and he always opposed Separation. Besides,
he may be only finessing with the Southern
contingent that threatens to split away from
him ?

Dear Bulletin, — This is the simple truth
about Maoriland’s position with respect to
Federation. Her contribution to the cost of
Federal Government would be, at the lowest
Convention estimate, £lBO,OOO per annum, and
her yearly loss of revenue by the adoption of
the Victorian tariff, £400,000. In other words,
she would have to pay £580,000 a year—for
what ? For the privileges of being in the
Commonwealth, of being outvoted and governed
by countries 1200 miles away who can’t
govern themselves and drop a million a
year each in trying, and of being de-
fended in time of war by a fleet of cock-
boats with more or less “ dicky” nervous
systems. They are a mean people these
Maorilanders, and they won’t do it. Hence
the tears of the Sydney Morning Herald,
which reminds Maoriland of the time when she
“ set a higher value on aid from Australia.”
Now as to that. When Maoriland v/as being
colonised, Sydney supplied the land-speculators
and rum-peddlers and head-hunters (there used
to be a big trade done in the heads of Maoris),
who made a little Sheol of their own at
Kororareka, then the principal settlement.
Sydney sent over a “Resident,” who incited
the artless Maori chiefs to run a Constitu-
tion of their own. Sydney found the
land-grabbers who went to Maoriland with
bottles of rum in one hand and ready-made
conveyances in the other ; and Sydney, after
doing more than was done otherwise to pro-
voke the natives, generously allowed Maoriland
to take a few regiments of Imperial soldiers,
who employed their spare time in painting the
settlers’ villages a lurid red. When Hongi,
the Maori Napoleon, returned from England,
loaded with presents from the nobility, who
bought those presents, and sold Hongi the
muskets and ammunition, with which he sub-
sequently carried out a comprehensive scheme
of human butchery and cannibalism ? Sydney !
Ungrateful Maoriland ! —Pakeha.
The Great Woman Question.
Dear Bulletin, —Premier Parkes 1 violent old-age love of
petticoats is making trouble. Too much sentimental
nonsense is talked about woman’s equality with man, her
surprising intelligence, and her ability to hold her own
in any sphere. The nature of the sexes at once capsizes
any such assertions. The one fact of maternity displaces
woman from all pretensions to equality with man. There
can be no privilege without a corresponding duty. If
women have the same political privileges as men, they
ought to accept the same responsibilities. Are they
willing to do this? Will lovely woman answer to the
bobby’s call, “In the Queen's name,” for a refusal to do
which a man can be punished ? The Queensland Defence Act
has provisions by which, stage by stage, every man Jack
in the community up to a certain age can be compulsorily
called out as a soldier; will lovely woman volunteer to
amazon to that roll-call ? Notice, again, the effect of
woman suffrage. Every voter can, by law, also become a
member of Parliament. Make a woman a “ votress ” and
she can illogically become a “membress.” Lovely, isn’t
it? Fancy Mistress Speaker dandling her last pair of
twins when ruling that the expression “nasty old cat’’
was strictly parliamentary ! Just fancy the Hon. the
Treasurer’s Budget speech being postponed on the certifi-
cate of an obstetric surgeon! Fancy Mrs. Bludanfire
becoming a captainess in the navy, or a Judgess of
the Supreme Court, and “ firing low and laying ’em out,”
or ordering a male culprit who had once wounded her
vanity, six dozen lashes, or to he hanged by the neck till
he was dead. Lovely woman, when she “ misses stays,”
won’t answer the helm. The one hope of preserving and
developing a healthy human race lies in keeping woman
to her womanly duties, in enabling her to live a natural,
as opposed to an artificial, life ; in preserving her nervous
system from all unnecessary strain, in relieving her
whenever possible from those particular forms of brain-
pressure to which men are especially subject. Physio-
logically speaking, in the absence of transmissible
■organic diseases such as phthisis, scrofula and so on, the
meanest, weediest creature that ever crawled on (lie
earth’s surface in human male shape may be the father
of offspring that can develope into healthy and strong
men and women, provided the mother lie a physically
fine animal. On the other hand, the most physically
perfect man abounding in vitality cannot hope to found
a healthy family—if any family at all—with a weedy,
high-strung, amende (though intellectual) wife. With a
few exceptions that merely prove the rule, experience
goes to show that specially brainy women (any more than
the most brainy men) are not calculated to become good
reproducers of their species. Under the present high
pressure life of modern civilisation and all-round competi-
tion, our young men “don’t feel well,” but if we place
young women in this whirling maelstrom of combat, and
they too begin to find that they “don’t feel well',’'it fr
idle to hope for the improvement or even maintenance of
the rape of humans., I believe that the strongest nation
is where the woman ispoliticaUy a cypher, where she is—
Ido not mean to be offensive—a healthy, happy mammal
—where, if she has to toil physically, her toil is of such a
nerveless nature that She is even improved physically and
in relation to maternal capacities. Take the German
nation, for example. lam English, but I have been in
Germany,as in other lands. I consider the Germans to be
physically the strongest nation in the world; yet they
produpe the greatest average of great original thinkers—
of philosophers, poets, litterateurs, scientists, strategists,
and soldiers. At one end of the German social scale you
find your Sohlegels, yOur Moltkes, your Schillers, your
Bismarcks ; at the. Other end you see the bulky, sullen
Bavarian emerging like a wolf from the forest to squelch
like eggshells the French. Yet in Germany woman is
nothing but what, from my point of view, she ought to be
—a wife, a mother, a domestic worker and overseer
(these spheres embracing all the realms of refinement in
which woman may advantageously shine); whereas in
France she is, at the very least, a shopkeeper, and her
upper-class influence has dominated French politics and
sapped French virility for at least two centuries. A
woman who pretends to intellectual superiority is
generally unlovely to man. No, sir ; lovely woman is just
about right where she is. Her weakness is her strength.
—Dipso.'
From what has leaked out, the recent
c[uadruple electric execution (or “ electrocution ”)
in New York appears to have been, as in Kemm-
ler's case, electro-circumlocution. The men died
hard—were literally frizzled to death.
Jas. Shaw. ex-Mayor of Adelaide, has
reached London. A Kapunda paper predicts that
when he meets Tummy he will slap that phleg-
matic person on the back violently, while remark-
ing : “ Let’s go and have some wallop ! ”
The description of that unpleasant person,
Mr. E. W. S. De Cobain, M.P., now “ wanted by
the police,” may be summed up in a sentence. He
is a pale, fat man in a long black coat. And
whenever a horrible offence comes to light it is
pretty safe to bet that there is a pale, fat man in
it somewhere.
” What price all the stocks about which
Sydney used to get the “ straight griffin ” every
Sunday?—the Dead Birds, Silver Hills, Silver
Peaks, Butchers Reefs North Contributing (a
moral, this one), Bonanza Consols, Bonanza Ex-
tendeds, Busts, Distendeds, &c. ? Likewise, the
Faithless Lubra which used to be filled with slugs
and caterpillars? Eheu? When a backer goes
bung he turns tipster.
What is the matter now with the latest
big mining sensation, the Last Call Mine ? Those
who bought into this block of solid “ oof ” at £2 per
share (there are only 200,000 shares in all) are now
beginning to look very blue, as they see the stock
quoted at 6s. or 8s. Yet experts have visited
this Cloncurry wonder and verified its tremendous
worth. When we invest the balance of our shat-
tered fortune in a mining spec, it shall be in a
show condemned by all experts in general, and
reported as utterly valueless by the local warden.
A few months ago the Orange contingent
on and about Sydney Exchange rejoiced exceed-
ingly at a dividend on “Toms”—about the last
thing any sane speculator expects from the ordi-
nary N.S. W. raining spec. Hereupon the local
talent bought heavily of the scrip. “Sell your
shirt andhuy Toms,” was the cry, for were there
not three more dividends in sight? But, alas ! on
the top of the threepenny dividend came a shil-
ling-call, and a sick feeling came o’er the “ bulls,”
as the holders who had been willing to share a
good thing shot their scrip on top of a broken-
backed market regardless of price. And now the
holders of Toms Contributing don’t ask what you
will give, but what you will take to become a
shareholder; and fourpenee per share is freely
presented to anyone courageous enough to carry
the baby.
The new Tasmanian hangman—who has
taken over the business so long and ably con-
ducted by Mr. Solomon Blay, and hopes, by
punctuality and strict attention to the obliteration
of customers to merit a continuance, &c.—started
work the other day by strangling Mr. Cooley.
The new executioner was disguised in false hair
and red paint. Why he was disguised Heaven
only knows, but most likely it was because he was
ashamed of himself. Hobart has fallen off a lot
of late years, and whereas eggs was undoubtedly
eggs down there in the olden days, they aren’t
always eggs now. The “ System ” is dead, and
the hangman doesn’t shine in society as he once
did, neither does the gaol-fiogger move in the best
circles, as the man of past years used to do. It
was always thus. The hangman withereth, and
the flogger fadeth, and all things pass away.
The absolute disregard of truth (without
telling any lies) which Sir Henry Parkes can
exhibit at the briefest notice is strikingly illus-
trated in the following extracts from two speeches
delivered by him in N.S.W., within two months.
Both extracts are from N.S. W. Hansard
I maintain that the true
patriotic feeling which we
ought to cultivate is that
every distinction, every
honour that can fall upon
her Majesty’s subjects
within the United Kingdom
ought to be shared with the
colonists of Australia. I
think that peerages ought
to be offered to worthy
persons in the colonies, as
well as to worthy persons in
the mother country.—May
21, 1891.
I sat here, sir, and I heard
this gentleman (Sciiev)
deliberately state that I
had advocated a colonial
peerage. At no moment of
my life, by any single word,
did I ever support anything
of the kind, or entertain a
single thought of the kind,
and that is a sample of the
truthfulness of the hon.
member’s references to me.
—2lst July, 1891.
A squatter who applied for a reduction of
rent, told a pathetic story in the Sydney Land
Court, the other day. His establishment was
194 miles beyond Wilcannia, in a parched and
hungry district where everything was sun and
sand, and some of the sand was yellow, and some
of it was grey, and some of it was glaring white
sand, and it was all one great, hot, boundless
monotony. The man next door was 30 miles
away, and on the other three sides there was no
man next door at all. He got five inches of rain
on an average every January, and the rest of the
year there was not even a shadow. Water was
so scarce that he and his men generally washed
for about three weeks in the same jugful, and
then it would be inspected by a committee,
before it was thrown away, to make dead sure
that they couldn’t wash in it for a week longer.
When they did throw it away, it was like burying
a beloved brother. The wool had to be carted 194
miles over ghastly roads, and then it was shipped
from Wilcannia if there was water enough in the
rivet. There was a big dam on the run which had
absorbed most of his spare cash, and as
soon as it was finished some officials came
and surveyed a road right through it,
and Were going to let all the water out.
They had about 6000 square miles of elbow-room
to make that road, but they must make it through
his dam, and nowhere else. Therefore, he had
come 915 miles to lay Ids troubles before the Land
Court, and 915 miles back would make just 1830.
If he got a reduction of rent it would pay him for
the journey; if he didn’t he would at least have had
the pleasure of seeing a few strange human beings,
and having a wash in some place where there was
lota of water. He was a poor, thirsty squatter,
and life wasn’t worth having.

There are 15 wool-buyers, seven of them

Sydney Echo, in advocating the lash for
“brutes,” points out the “presentment” on the
subject which a British jury lately made to Mr.
Justice Hawkins. The Echo, however, carefully
suppresses what Mr. Justice Hawkins said in
reply to the British jury aforesaid.
The Provident Society in connection with
the establishment of Messrs. Anthony Hordern
and Sons, held a social at Sydney New Masonic
Hall, last Friday. The proceedings consisted of
songs, recitations, violin solos, and various other
joyous items, and a dance followed. Everything
was a pronounced success, and the show ended
happily for all parties concerned. Mr. Harris
acted as manager and superintendent of things in
general, and filled the bill in a gratifying manner.
The Victorian Supreme Court having
decided to uphold the Judge’s ruling that a man
who knew the difference between right and
wrong could not be insane, and the Executive
having therefore ratified murderer Colston’s
doom, it is contemplated to bring before the
Court a number of madmen who admittedly know-
right from wrong and are yet confined in the
public asylums, and ask for their discharge. The
legal definition of insanity is, of course, 500 years
behind scientific facts.
A Sydney Sunday paper throws a column
and a-half of appalling language at Parkes, and
describes him, to put the matter gently and in an
abbreviated form, as being all the hogs, dogs, and
devils of this world rolled into one. In a general
sort of way it asserts that the giddy old man is all
the bad things it can remember, and all the bad
things it has forgotten as well. And now the
country wants to know—as it has often wanted to
know before, and as it never did know, however
much it wanted—why Parkes calmly stands this
sort of thing, instead of starting the largest libel-
action that ever raised the circulation of a paper’
Why is it?

Garrick 11 The idler/’ _
Criterion A Night Off.
Otclorama Gettysburg.
“The Idler,” a play founded on a lack of
acquaintance with the extradition laws, on re-
vival at Sydney Garrick, drew a big first-night
bouse. It is not so well played as previously.
Young Cosgrove has not the weight and
experience necessary to delineate the highly-
respcetable and titled M.P., who has been a
debauched gambler. Nelly Lyons, badly wigged,
is altogether misfitted as the gushy, husband-
hunting widow. Somehow, in the present pro-
duction, all the faults of the play are accentuated,
particularly those of the dragged-in comedy to
obtain whose lighting-up effects the author makes the
ingbnue hunt her father, a twice-widowed, mental
and physical ruin, even into bachelor chambers,
while the Yankee millionaire—a presumably
sombre Mafiaite, W’ho thirsts for the gore of his
brother’s murderer —fills up the intervals between
vows of vengeance in making idiotic love to the
sister-in-law of the object of his detestation.
Another jarring note is provided by the hinted at
engagement of the widowed and fatuous dilapi-
dation, aforesaid, to the Idler's mother, a com-
fortable widow in a high state of preservation,
mental and otherwise, although throughout she
seems to have looked on that social mildew after
the fashion of the Lady Benevolent, who
cheers the declining days of rheumatic in-
digence with chews of tobacco and flannel in rolls.
The Idler, who is “not a man of the world,” of
Chas. Cartwright is quite up to its old-time
excellence, though unnecessarily strident and
noisy at times, while counterbalancing the too
fatal fascination resulting from the donning of
better-cut pants by the putting-on of an infinitely
worse-shaped wig. Probably we shall have to
take a course of some very nauseous actress as an
emetic to rid us of reminiscences of Sara. Mean-
time, the only actresses that can be tolerated are
those who are satisfied to let the highly emotional
rip. Olga Nether sole doesn’t; that is probably
the reason that she scarcely meets with such uni-
versal approval as on her last visit. Cautley kills
his American by “dolling” him up and painting
him a mild terra-cotta hue. His love-locks and
mustivy demand such attention that little time
remains for anything else, and when he stepped out
of a band-box on to the stage for the first act he
seemed afraid to move lest something should give
way. Jenny Watt-Tanner and Mary Kingsley
are all right, and Harold Russell is little worse than
before. There is a deal of crude, young-man
cynicism in “The Idler,” though some of it, for
instance the line, “ The sufferings of one-half the
world are necessary to the happiness of the other
half,” fairly hits the mark. It may profitably fill
the bill throughout its destined fortnight,

“The Merry Wives of Windsor” hasn’t
staggered the Sydney public to any appreciable
extent at Her Majesty’s, chiefly because they
have stayed away in large masses. The perform-
ance has suffered thereby, in most instances; it is
hard to pump up enthusiasm to a chill and empty
house. George Rignold and his lady-assistants
seem least affected thereby, and Sterling Whyte’s
Bardolph is one of the best drunkards known to
the local stage. “ Bill ” Rignold’s pale-blue cap
and ribbons of the early acts sit too garishly on
his elephantine bulk, and in his ground wallow-
ings he is reminiscent of a stranded whale. The
irritating custom still prevails at this house of
taking “ calls ” before the curtain, dooming the
unhappy mummers to troop across like Richard-
son’s showmen. A raising of the curtain on an
extension of tableau seems the only artistic
method of response to exhibitions of popular
approval. Sims’ theatrical meteor has had a long
spell at this house, but his “ Lights o’ London ”
are turned up once more on Saturday night.
There will be an interregnum of four nights at
Her Majesty’s on 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th Sep-
tember, between the leaving of the Go. for Mel-
bourne and the arrival of the Laura Villiers’
crowd.

At Sydney Royal business continues big
with “Old Guard,” in which Elton continues his
wild career of beer-drawing, shaving, and sentry-
go with much approval. Charles Ryley being
laid up with congestion of the lungs, Syd. Deane
plays Marcel, and Tom Grundy has stepped into
the thereby vacated shoes of Caramel. Whether
looked at vocally or verbally “The Old Guard”
cannot be accounted anything but an extravanga
of the “Evangeline” type. The latter having
been successful here, it was a foregone conclusion
that the other should go and do likewise. By the
way, we learn from a contemporary that “ the
gods ” have declared as a reason for encoring the
ballet that they’ve got to pay double and so
demand double dancing. The Gaiety Co. are due
on 12th September, and as soon as J. C. William-
son’s six months lease is up some alterations will
be made to the proscenium and a new act drop, a
Venetian scene by Geo. Gordon, will be hung.

Pattie Browne having retired with a
fractured knee-cap, Emma Temple' has filled her
place at Sydney Criterion during the last few
nights, and the latter lady’s post as Mrs. Bill
has been occupied by Nellie Mortyne. “ A Night
Off ” is revived on Saturday for a season of 11
nights. “Dr. Bill’s” revival biz. has been quite
equal to the primary season.

At Coogee Aquarium Manager Larmour
intends to revive Saturday afternoon shows with
the return of warm weather, and future Sunday
afternoon concerts will be graced with a band for

W. H. Jude and his concert-lecture
matineed on Wednesday before a good audience
of mostly women. Mr. Judo is a single-handed
show (not in any way resembling Punch and
Jude) “under the patrpnage of the Governor and
Bishop,” and as he is usually faced by a congre-
gation and not an audience, his programme is full
of constantly-recurring clerical witticisms which
enrage the heathen portion of his auditors. Mr.
Jude must possess a wrought-iron gullet, for he
talks and sings for over two hours without becom-
ing throaty in the least. All his songs are “ little
things of His own,” and a new one, “Jack
Ashore,” ought to get a bid from loud, fierce
baritones who love to stand on the rolling deck
and all that sort of thing. His strong speciality
is the harmonium, on which he is certainly a
unique and marvellous performer.

R. S. Smythe, having secured his two
celebrities, Stanley and Max O'Rell, has been
touring in Brittany and Normandy with Henry
Blackburn, the art-critic, who wrote two charm-
ing volumes about those pleasant bits of old
France wh’ch once formed portion of Old
England. The Much-Travelled is a very good
judge of pictures, and was the first to discover
that the so-called replica of Mrs. Butler’s famous
picture, which the trustees of the Sydney Art
Gallery purchased, was not really painted by her.
Smythe will remain in England to welcome back

John Sheol (’L) Sullivan and his “ puggy
push” opened at the Opera House in the Mar-
vellous City last Saturday night before an audi-
ence mainly composed of the outpourings of the
Apollo Hall and other bruisers’ resorts. Up in
the gallery they noisily made their presence
known throughout. Owing to indisposition,
Sullivan the Slogger did not put in an ap-
pearance until the third act, consequently the
expectant public displayed considerable im-
patience of the tissue of trivialities and tauto-
logical trash with which the piece labelled
“Honest Hearts and Willing Hands” abounds.
Duncan B. Harrison is responsible for the
cobbling of this American absurdity, and has
apportioned to himself speeches as long as
those recorded by any phonograph. Dramatic
construction and coherency are not in it, and the
torrent of talk tails out to a lame and impotent
conclusion. Slogger Sullivan is a fine but flabby
person with a convex stomach, whose present con-
dition does not argue well for his chance with
Frank Slayin should he meet him. His acting,
though intended to be pathetic, partook of the
bathetic, and the audience roared with laughter at
his alleged sentiment. This irreverence aroused
the wrath of the podgy “ pug ” who crossed to the
prompt corner of the stage and said, more
suo : “ Some o’ yer will get a tail put on yer. Ain’t
yer got no respect for the awjence?” This
brilliant flight of oratory was vociferously ap-
plauded, and the angered giant bowed his
acknowledgments, then struck an attitude. The
boxing scene between himself and Jack Ashton
was a palpably rehearsed affair, although after
the second round Sullivan was winded and seemed
distressed otherwise. The verdict of the public
was anything but favourable, and the omens
are for a short-lived season. The Australian
public will not stand tommyrot dramas, and the
Slogger will have to jump into the prize-ring if he
w r ants to make money in this country. Between
the fourth and fifth acts Duncan Harrison made
an ill-advised apology to the audience for short-
comings. This kind of thing is now called
“ making a Villiers,’ 1 in view of recent appeals of
a like nature.

“We Two” and “Woodbarrow Farm”
have been limping along at the Royal to unprofit-
able results, and a change of tactics is now an-
nounced. French melodrama is to have a show,
Burnand’s adaptation of “Une Cause Oelebre ”
being underlined for production. “ Peril,”
at the Bijou, has succeeded in drawing fair
attendance, and on Saturday next, “Devo-
tion,” by Dion Boucicault, junr., will be staged
for the first time in the colonies. The
piece had somewhat of a run in London
some years ago, nevertheless the Argus scribe
the other day wrote that this was the first drama-
tic essay of the youthful B. As a matter of fact
he has written several pieces,

The London Gaiety Co. are still wrestling
with “Ruy Bias,” and owing to the illness of
Chas. Danby its announced successor, “Cinder
Ellen,” will not be placed on the boards till Satur-
day next. Fred. Storey has been advantageously
doubling Don Salluste with his own part.

Opera at the Alexandra succeeds in a fair
to middling business manner. Madame Simonsen
decidedly had a bit up her sleeve in the Cutticas,
husband and wife. The former is an excel-
lent tenor of the robust order, and his wife a
cultured soprano. Her singing of the “ Last Rose
of Summer,” in “Martha,” knocked her hearers
and the non-hirsute Hopetoun put his hands
together for an encore the night he put in an
appearance. Madame Simonsen has gathered
together some very capable singers, and should
receive her reward by the patronage of the many.
The minor shows are all doing well ; Frank M.
Clark’s audiences, at the Gaiety, maintaining their
manifold attendance, the Victoria Hall receiving
good recognition, while Phil. Stuart smiles
serenely as he counts the Waxworks receipts.

The writer remembers our late visitor, Mrs.
Abbey, playing Nan, in “Good for Nothing,” at
the little Margate (Eng.) Theatre. Probably
there never was another Nan who could so well
afford to wash her face before an audience and
look so fresh and rosy when she had finished
towelling. Then, and for some time afterwards,
the beautiful Florence Gerard (not Girard) was
serving her stage novitiate in Henry Neville’s
company. She played in the curtain-raiser when
“Turn of the Tide” was produced at the
Olympic, with George Anson and Mrs. John
Wood as Mr. and Mrs. Danby.

The Victorian Orchestra breathed its last
in a miserable style at Hamilton Clarke’s benefit
concert. A large number of instrumentalists
evinced their devotion to their late leader, and
supplied further evidences of the beautiful
brotherly-loving influences of professional music
(particularly the “high-class” article) by not
turning up on the interesting occasion. It was a
fitting end to a long and weary attempt at proving
that the Victorian Orchestra, as conducted and
managed, was a source of public delight, instead
of tire hollowest of failures all the while. As a
matter of fact Hamilton Clarke did not shine as a
conductor. He has considerable merit as a com-
poser, though.

As the Mariposa got alongside her berth
at Woolloomooloo somebody in the crowd yelled,
“Show us John L. Bring him to the front.”
Then the moonlight shone on a mass of butcher-
meat leaning over the rail, and, in a voice of bovine
sweetness, the distinguished visitor hailed the
shore with, “Hello, you bloomin’swine !” We
believe the observation was simply a friendly
greeting to an old pal. Anyhow, it’s the first
experience we got of the great artist who followed
the divine Sara at Her Majesty’s, Sydney.

It is funny to heat an actor criticise the
performance of a brother artist. He lays himself
out to find faults in the “ business,” the untradi-
tional exit, the way of “taking the stage,” the
everything that has no bearing upon the realisa-
tion of the character in hand. He can’t, in many
cases, understand that personal mannerism, mag-
netism, and “style” are worth a lot of salary to
a man who has to engage the attention of an
audience, quite unconcerned about what he
doesn’t so long as what he does is effective. The
actor-critic is shocked by the incapacity of a
G. 0. Miln, and smiles pityingly when the house
occasionally rises at such a raw amateur. Now,
the real, good sound sort of actor, according to the
nerfesh, is Jimmy Cathcart. “You can't place
iiim wrong,” they will say. Quite true, again.
The veteran is correctly mechanical in all
characters.
At Poverty Point.
Some of Lyster’s old chorus once again showed up in
Simonsen's. They beat the ballet tor lasting, and are
good, too, although familiars have disappeared, notably
the bassoonlike grandfather Benham, with his nasal pom-
pom ; and he came from the London Italian Opera of
1851, when poor Susini was the star basso there, in
“Ernani.” There used to be two little, old, fat fellows,
intensely Hebraic, credited with fish-hawking in the day
time, but one was a vocal ophecleide, and the other a
human trombone. Raucous youth is long growing to
this. Good job.
Rumoured that the lovely leading juvenile at a Sydney
theatre is about to espouse the lately-added and equally
lovely soubrette who recently seceded from the ranks of

Coppin pioneered Melbourne opera with such as Cathe-

famous dictum, “Operawon’t pay in Australia.” Madame
Carandini was the original here of the dashing bandit,
Fra Diavolo.
Sara Bernhardt had a rough trip to Auckland. The

Someone publicly reproved J. O. Williamson for favour-
ing Melbourne over Sydney in the matter of “ new pro-
ductions,” i.e., new so far as Australia is concerned
J.C.W. writes to say that Sydney, in past years, has
enjoyed the honour of various new productions, viz.,
“Pinafore,” “Pirates,” “La Mascotte,” “Merry Duchess,”
“Estrella,” “ Mikado,” and so on, and that but for certain
circumstances Sara Bernhardt would have opened in
Sydney city. He also avers that when he has a theatre
in the old city equal to the Princess of the new, that
original productions will be more fairly divided. The
Bulletin thinks Sydney, as a rule, has all the best of the
arrangement. Melbourne acts as rehearsal-ground, in
Sydney they get the perfect production.
First night of “Dancing Girl,” £268. Eheu 1
It is interesting to know’ that the ladies and gentlemen
of Melbourne Shakespeare Society who read “Much Ado
About Nothing” got over a big difficulty by leaving out
the most cerulean passages of that antique play’. How-
ever, when one dull member did blurt out someth! ng
ghastly there was not even a smirk.
The other day The Bulletin printed a paragraph stating
that Mr. Henry Edwards, who lately died in New York,
left no near relatives. Mrs. Elizabeth Elinor Edwards
now w’rites us from Point Piper Road, Woollahra, Sydney,
asking us to mention that she is the law’ful wife of Henry
Edwards’ brother William, who is supposed to have died a
few years since in Queensland, and who has three children
living. Any exact information concerning the death of
Mr. William Edwards will be thankfully received by The
Bulletin.
Sydney Articled Clerks’ Association has decided that
the recent visit of Sara B. did tend to elevate the drama.
“Nous vous aimerons toujours ,” shouted a Frenchman
from the crowd, as Sara B. steamed off from Sydney
wharf. Which recalls the fact there is in Sydney a
lawyer, now somewhat battered by years and adventures
in the fields of love, w’ho long ago visited Europe, and
came back knowing only one French phrase: “Jevom
aimerai toujours.''
The new Gaiety burlesque, Melbourne Princess’,
“ Cinder Ellen,” is mainly from Fred Leslie’s pen, and he
enacts a servant, something like the Lone Fisherman, in-
terfering with all the business, though with plenty of
singing and dancing. Miss Farren is Cinder Ellen, the
two sisters being Misses Grey and Levey, while Misses
Pedley and Blenheim are two equerries. Danby will
have a better chance as a funny kind of Ally Sloper, Sir
Ludgate Hill, father of the family, the Baron Balderdash
of Byron’s “ Cinderella.” Fred. Storey is Prince Bel-
gravia. The four biggest Melbourne firms have worked
on the costumes. Designs by Wilhelm, of London, and
Hugh Paterson, of Melbourne. Goatcher’s scenery.
Leopold Jordan, late of Sydney D.T., is now in the
States and does well managing theatrical companies on
tour. He has written a play, “Dorothy’s Dilemma,”
which is to be produced by the clever Rose Coghlan.
“ That it possesses a military interest is attested,” says a
Bulletin correspondent, “by the posters, which depict
the buxom Rose, arrayed in Hussar uniform, seated on a
fiery steed which cavorts about the stage. Miss Coghlan
is not yet very certain about her equitation, and maybe
seen cantering nervously round Central Park under the
tutelage of Leopold aforesaid. There is a tremendous
fad for stage realism here. What they chiefly approve is
homely rustic comedy of the blameless order; public
appreciation whereof, amounting to delirium, may be
ensured by the introduction of a real pigstye containing
a real pig fed with real kitchen refuse emitting a real stale
odour and attracting real flies.”
Copy of letter received by Photographer Falk from

My dear Falk, —I thank you a thousand and thousand
times for the adorable and artistic photographs which you
have made of me ; they are the prettiest and most faith-
ful. I take both your hands and tell you once more

Half-a-dozen of the above-mentioned photos, lie before
us. They are undoubtedly fine and very faithful pictures
and much superior to those taken in Melbourne by this

An American actress was asked, the other day, whether
she ever rehearsed stage-kisses. “Not repeatedly', but
only just once. I don’t care to be surprised by a peculiar
sort of kiss on the night of a performance, so I alway s
have an actor show me beforehand just how he is going to
do it. There’s nothing in acting that I dread so much as
a kiss. No, I’m not a prude, and do not suffer from the
actual contact of a polite and good-looking fellow’s lips,
but there are more chances of disaster in a stage-kiss than
in almost any action in the drama. In the first place, it
is apt to disturb my make-up. Then, the actor may be a
nervous man and pull away at my wig, if I’m wearing one,
or he may clutch me so tight that when he lets me go I
lose my balance and get laughed at.”

and the river Birs is full C« tenors and sopranos, and the

blowers, and such are in the hospital, and whole choirs

POLITICAL
POINTS
The greasiest politician often climbs to
die top of the poll.
In Kaweah, Gronlund’s Commonwealth,
men and women receive equal wages.
Hansard should be the Bible of the
People as well as of the Parliamentarians.
According to Tom Glassey, there are in
Queensland 130,000 adult males, of whom 40,000
are not voters.
The M‘Carthyites aver that Parnell’s ad-
herents after the general election will not number
more than five.
Sydney D.T. credits Kidd, of Camden,
with a speech of Jawbone Neild’s. Both gentle-
men feel annoyed.
Lessing : “It is bad when a king is a vul-
ture amid the carcasses, and worse when he is a
carcass amid the vultures.” In which class is the
coming K. ?
Andy Kelly, M.P. : “ The man who won’t
tike the trouble to register his vote, shouldn’t
have one, and I’d make registration and voting
compulsory.”
Sir Archibald Michie was the author of
the stinging phrase, “the wealthy lower orders,”
and not Chief J ustice Higinbotham, as asserted
in a Sydney journal.
South Australia receives nearly £70,000
a year by her halfpenny land-tax on unimproved
values. It is likely that another halfpenny will
be put on before long.
“ William Trenwith, Esq., M L.A.,” was
announced to lecture in Melbourne last week.
“ Esq.” is bad. It is the first rung of the ladder
on the descent to “Sir.”
In Parkes’ article in the Contemporary
Review for July, he describes his opponents as
“ men of useless lives—the most worthless part of
the Australian population.”
For the Calcutta native press to declare,
as it does, that England governs India by brute
force is as wicked as it would be to say that
England imposed opium on China by brute force.
B. R. Wise now talks very advanced de-
mocracy. Had he been as outspoken ere the tide
turned, he could to-day have been the coining
N.S.W. Premier, with 50 Labour-members at his
back.
According to the British Chancellor, “the
bare statement of a sovereign is equivalent to the
word of a subject under oath.” Very likely it is.
The bare statement of anybody is about equal to
his oath.
Parkes had better blow his political candle
out suddenly and not let it peter out slowly
leaving a bad smell. Een his erawlsomest
friends admit that he is beginning to drivel
shockingly.
The N.S.W. Legislative Assembly contains
141 members, and only one out of the lot dares
openly to say a single word in favour of plural
voting. There is a fact for the English newspapers
to chew over.
It is said that the N.S.W. squatters,
having nobbled the irrigation department in a
roundabout way, are now trying to engineer the
Forestry branch of Lands to their own purposes—
especially in the matter of reserves.
Parkes reluctantly made Bruce Smith
N.S.W. Treasurer. Eager to secure a counterfoil to
his powerful, ambitious colleague, he dangled the
portfolio before Garvan for a whole fortnight;
but that astute, over-solemn Oppositionist only
smelt at the bait.
Balfour declares that he will never consent
to the Irish police being placed under the control
of local bodies Balfour’s game is the direct
opposite—to place the local bodies under the con-
trol of the police. How absurd these things
appear in Australia!
Mr. Ringnose Wise’s lecture, “ What
Parliament can do for Labour,” is interpreted,
perhaps rightly, “What Labour can do for Mr.
B. Ringnose Wise.” His attitude in N.S.W.
Parliament is not pro-Parkes, but pro-Wise, with
a firm grip on the rail, pending the cat’s jump.
Prof. Bryce, writing to Premier Parkes,
joins earnestly in the hope expressed by the latter
that “the peoples of the colonies may decide as
those of the American States did in 1787-90.”
Isn’t this tantamount to trusting that they’ll
make waste paper of the present Commonwealth
Bill ?
According to Adelaide Quiz, the first
known user of the phrase, “One man'one vote,”
was Major Cartwright, who, at the beginning of
the century, wrote ;—“ Every one man sha 1 l have
one vote, and for any man, however rich, to
have any more than one vote is against natural
justice.”
Attorney-General Homburg’s (S. A.) Agri-
cultural Holdings Bill provides for tenants having
a right to all improvements they may make; also
the right to assign tenancy and acquire the tee-
simple of their holdings. If passed by the
Assembly, this radical Bill will be shelved by the
Upper House.
Munro’s recent admission that he had per-
sonally lost £120,000 in one land-company, but
nevertheless held on, is evidence in favour of
having at the head of affairs professional politicians
who really concentrate. Is the fag-end of tho
mind of a man like Munro really good enough to
govern Victoria ?
One rock ahead of the Labour Electoral
Leagues is the growing ascendancy of the Trades
and Labour Councils upon whom it should be
impressed that they represent after all but a
section of the great voting body, and that the
undue use of the Councils’ well-organised influence
may lead to the institution of Australian Tam-
many Halls,
A glorious row took place the other night
in the Parliamentary refreshment-room at Wel-
lington (Maoriland). One of the Northern mem-
bers was using strong language, and a Southern
member gambolled on his prostrate form with both
feet. No names are given, but if the man on top
wasn’t Henry Smith Fish, we will feel more sur-
prised than usual.
Premier Munro has confessed to the Vic-
torian Assembly that Prime Minister Parkes was
the godfather of the term “Commonwealth ” in'
the secret committee of the Federal Convention,
The Bulletin is prepared to bet that Munro is
wrong. Deakin was the originator, and, wishing
to have the term adopted, artfully handed the
idea over to Parkes.
The Bulletin conceives that it is the
duty of the N.S.W. Labour-party to politically
support Parkes simply as the hangman supports
his victim—until the time comes to drop him
through the trap with a dull, sickening thud. If
the Labour-party begin to cuddle Parkes instead
of simply holding him up he will take them down
the trap with him.
Minister Carruthers is telling the N.S.W.
Assembly the same old chestnut about Neild’s
GO-AHEAD VICTORIA.
N. S. W ALES: “Well, if the Victorians are so superior in everything, as you say they
are, how do you account for all the railway accidents they’ve had there?”
VICTORIA: “Ah! that’s their go-ahead style.”
Infants Protection Bill as he told last year about
Traill’s One-man-one-vote Bill, Neild’s Bill is to
be obstructed—because Carruthers wants to have
the kudos of obliterating baby-farming. The
same petty jealousy is exhibited to Melville’s
Free Education Bill.
Sydney Echo wants Traill to define the
nice distinction he draws between “ intelligence ”
and “intellect.” As Traill mayn’t have the
necessary time on his hands, The Bulletin illus-
trates the difference : Running the Echo requires
intelligence, but not intellect. Thus, we speak of
the “intelligence” of a blackfellow, but of tha
“ intellect ” of Dan O'Connor.
“Socialism means, or wishes to mean,
industrial co-operation, community of interest,
universal sympathy, a paying not more to hand
than head, a greater share than hitherto of the
wealth which can only be produced by the com-
bined efforts of both, and has within it the secret
of an orderly and benign reconstruction of
society.”—J. Russell Lowell.
The S. A. Labour-party are already
organising for the general elections, and in case of
vacancies or a dissolution, they ai’e even now pre-
pared. Out of the 54 seats, they reckon they
could secure at least 20 for bona-fide labour-
members, It was principally the fear of a disso-
lution that induced tho S. A. Assembly to keep
Playford in power a few weeks back.
In the last two N.S.W. Parliaments a Bill
has been put through the Assembly to extend the
Employers’ Liability Act to sea-faring men ; but
no one has ever been found wi'ling to take charge
of the Bill in the Council. For the sake of this
democratic measure alone Parkes should be
“squeezed ” into summoning a democrat (say Mr.
Luscombe) to the Council to advocate the cause of
the sailor at the feet of capitalism.
Both Dibbs and Garvan—the leading Op-
positionists—in N.S.W. Assembly, were disfran-
chised at the late election for East Sydney,
although Dibbs has practically lived at the
Reform Club for 10 years, while Garvan has been
associated with a house in Castlereagh-street
since his infancy—42 years ago. Yet a man who has
not set foot inside the Australian Club for 25
years is on the roll in respect of an alleged room
there.
A Mr. Wickham, who has for over 20 years
held the position of accountant in the N.S.W. rail-
ways, was some time since superseded by a Mr.
Hall, whose principal distinctive qualification
appears to be that he has just arrived from Eng-
land, doncherknow. Mr. Wickham is still
retained, however, at the same salary (£700), and
the new accountant receives £lOOO. So the bleed-
ing country now pays £l7OO for work that pre-
viously cost £7OO.
Cologne Gazette said last week that the
Pope desired war, so that he might regain his
temporalities. How could the Pope be bene-
fited by a war ? Is Atheistical France to give
him his temporalities ? Or Italy ? And what
would either of them gain ? At the same time it
must be said that the Pope is stronger without
any temporalities. The more you take away from
him, the more powerful he is —and that, if they
only knew it, is the case with all clergymen.
That dear, good man, Robert Harper,
explains that the Victorian National Association
is not to be “what is known as ‘ Conservative,’
nor sectional, nor anything except what is free,
liberal, enlightened, and all that sort of thing.
But the gentle lamb further explains that “there
is an element of impending danger in the present
course of politics which furnishes a sufficient
I’eason for the establishment of this Association.”
In short, it is intended as a free, broad, advanced,
unsectional national movement for stoushing the
Labour candidate.
“It is a mistake to think that no section
of men with a political object in view can do
without the aid of one of the great parties. The
Socialist cannot accept the aid of either party.
His plan is not to win the alliance of the Liberals
and the Tories, but to compass their confusion.
He will never make friends of the rent and interest
mongers. His one aim, his one hope, his highest
desire is to destroy them. This is plain English ;
but it is as well we should understand each other.”
The N.S.W. Cabinet are borrowing money
from any institution, person or thing that will
lend. A year ago M‘MiHan had £3,000,000 of
loan-money in his possession ; within the last six
months he borrowed £1,785,000 in London and
Sydney, borrowing as low a sum as £12,000 in one
instance; and in addition to these moneys the
Treasury absorbed £4,000,000 worth of trust-
funds. When he left office a few weeks ago, he
had spent £9,000,000 for which no provision had
been made.
Two things are now plain to The Bul-
letin : (1) that to prevent personation there
must be electoral registration, and (2) that
registration must, in the democratic inter-
est, be made compulsory, just as the registra-
tion of births, deaths, and marriages is compul-
sory. The poor man who hustles for his living
will, unless legally compelled to register, so often
neglect to get his ticket that his disfranchisement
through default will more than counterbalance
the effect of the abolition of plural-voting.
Editor Higgs still noisily uses the few
opportunities left him for venting personal ill-
humour in the Australian Workman by slating
those legislators who have sufficient vigour and
ability to earn money honestly outside of legisla-
tive work, and denying that they may fairly earn
anything beyond their Parliamentary pay. Would
Mr. Higgs, a partner in a (no doubt remunera-
tive) printing business, have been in a position of
sufficient independence to write thus had he,
instead of suffering defeat, been returned foi
South Sydney ? Hardly !
The N.S.W. Government organ is shying
big pellets at Parkes’ Some-Men-One-Yote Bill-
under the friendly cover of a cynical contributor.
The Bill has been proved to be a delusion and a
snare, as far as democracy is concerned. And yet
the Sydney D.T., built up with the pennies of the
workers, will not itself openly and directly blast
the abortion. Had such a disgraceful measure
emanated from Dibbs or Traill, the province
would have been warned in hysterical fashion to
beware of a measure as remarkable for its clumsy
machinery as for its treachery to democratic
principles.
Dear Bulletin, —The ranks of the Labor-
party in N.S.W. Parliament include at least one
traitor. The sooner this skunk is drummed out
of the caucus-room the better for the cause of
democracy. Not a caucus of this new political
power is held but a synopsis of its deliberations
is conveyed straight to Bruce Smith. One in-
stance alone need be quoted to prove the above
statement. Recently the Labour-party—all the
merinos—passed an important resolution relevant
to a measure before the Assembly. The caucus
had scarcely been risen 10 minutes, when a
straight and true Labour-member actually saw a
verbatim et litteratim copy of the resolution in
Bruce Smith’s hands. The Parkes Cabinet are
accurately and promptly posted up in all the
doings and sayings of the Labour-party.—S.S.B.
Says the Australasian, dealing with the
N.S.W. Electoral Reform Bill
As a matter of course, the “ One-Man-One-Yote ” clause
is made an essential part, and the spendthrifts will have
equal power with the thrifty workers, and the illiterate
and criminals will be considered to have as much know-
ledge of political affairs as the educated classes and those
who scrupulously obey the law. The tneory seems to be
that the voting power of the elector should be in inverse
ratio to his ability.
This is begging the question with a vengeance.
The slavish organ of Property starts off with the
assumption that the wealthy are invariably
thrifty, well-educated, intelligent, and well-
behaved, and that , the propertyless are inevitably
spendthrifts, criminals, illiterates, and ignora-
muses. Of course this is not true ; even if it were,
it furnishes the strongest of arguments for the
alteration of a social system that, by unequal
division of the world’s goods, unequally divides,
also, the world’s goodness.
Dear Bulletin,— Parkes is playing a wily
game with the N.S.W. Labour-party. Unless
they show more nous and spout less often, the old
Parliamentary hand will dish them body and soul.
His Electoral Bill is craftily framed : One-Man-
One-Vote is to be enacted, if Parkes is allowed to
have his sweet will, in one Bill, but is to be con-
trolled in its use by another Bill, constituting the
electorates, which may be contracted or expanded
to suit the waning fortunes of a Cabinet. The
Representation of the People Bill does not stand
on its own bottom, but is readable with the Seats
Redistribution Bill, which has not yet seen the
light of day. Parkes wishes to push the former
Bill through the Assembly, before taking up tho
second Bill. His game, of course, is to get the
One-Man-One-Vote Bill out of the hands of the
Assembly, and then tell that House it is corn-
raited to the Seats Arranging Bill, and therefore
is bound in honour to pass it. Let the Labour-
party examine all Parkes’ political pills.—W. ,T.
Those who argue that the attack made in
N.S.W. Parliament on Judge Docker’s manner of
administering what he calls justice was cowardly
because the attacked “had no opportunity to
reply,” should remember that it was Judge
Docker’s persistent unnecessary attacks on
prisoners, witnesses, and jurors who really had no
opportunity of reply that provoked members’
criticism. Besides, it is absurd to say that a
J udge is defenceless. He can write to the papers
(as many Judges have done), and even the meanest
Judges are religiously toadied to by the daily
press, which has in N.S.W. unblushingly com-
pounded many absolute judicial crimes. The
J udges have to be taught (and the day approaches
when they will be taught) that there is nothing
“ sacred ” about their office any more than there
is about that of the scavenger—that they are
simply the overpaid servants of a long suffering
community, and that if they are cheeky to their
masters they will be fired right out just as a grocer
fires out his rebellious shopboy. The first thing to
be done to bring them to their senses is to strip
them and their minions of their absurd wigs and
millinery.
Three times last week did Premier Parkes
object, in N.S.W. Parliament, to certain things
being done, not because such things were in them-
selves bad or illogical, but because they weren’t
dope in England. “What would be thought in
Hingland, if,”&c.,&c. This miserable dependence
on the precedents of a country foreign to most of
our population recalls a characteristic incident in
tho political life of Peter Lalor. During his
tenure of the Speakership of the Victorian
Assembly he had a controversy—one of a multi-
tude —with David Gaunson. The question at
issue was one concerningParliaraentary procedure,
and Gaunson quoted Sir Erskine May in support
of his views. The Speaker differed from the hon.
member, and was not to be swayed by the opinion
of May. “ But,” said Gaunson, “he is the greatest
authority on Parliamentary procedure.’’ “ Who
says so?” mildly asked Peter. “Ho is so con-
sidered in the English Parliament,” replied the-
other. “He may be good enough for the English,
Parliament,” announced the Speaker, “ but he is
of no authority here.” “Then who is the
authority here ? ” persisted Gaunson. “lAM I”
exclaimed Lalor in a voice of thunder. Australia,
wants men who dare to make precedents.

The late Professor Wilson, of Melbourne
University, was a slave to duty. When his class
would take a holiday for a football or cricket-
match, the Professor would attend the class-room
and deliver his lecture to empty benches. The
most inconvenient result, to the students, was
that the items in that particular lecture were sure
to be embodied in the exam.-papers.
Durant Yernon Harcourt died in Mel-
bourne last week. He was an attorney, but
intimately mixed up in journalism, and well
known in social coteries, such as the old-time
Bohemians, and the Owls of a more recent day.
He had a hand, with Capt. Henry Morin
Humphreys, in the Magpie, over which the Cap-
tain dropped his £l2OO ; Marcus Clarke’s Humbug
was of the same era and kidney.
Of course a Cabinet Minister could not

" Rev. Arthur F. Collier, a Sydney clergy-
man, will probably make a big fortune out of his
patent “audible telephone,” which speaks with a
loud voice (over 5000 miles, it is averred) and will
do away with the present necessity of rising from
one’s desk to listen to a message when the instru-
ment rings up. This telephone will enable every
well-regulated clergyman to hear the faintest
message from Divine Providence calling him to_a
billet with a higher screw.
Sir Redmond Barry was very pedantic as
to his tailoring. No other Melbourne man dressed
as he did. Always wearing very tight pantaloons
tightly strapped under foot, he looked more bke a
military officer in mufti than a Supreme Court
Judge. He once gave the name of his tailor to a
well-known “Block ” man, who instantly ordered
trousers on the Barry model. This gentleman,
having inserted himself into the garments, found,
on sitting down, that they split completely. On
complaining to the tailor, he was consoled with
the information that as he did not state which
description of the Barry pantaloons he wanted, he
had been accommodated with a pair of Sir Red-
mond’s “ walking ” trousers.

The Land of the Crocodile.
(BY MAROOGALINE.)
The nose of Queensland’s Colonial Secre-
tary, Horace Tozer, has been a “prominent
feature ” in a recent Gympio press cor-
respondence. The true story of that nose shall
now be related. Tozer’s Homan proboscis was
aggravated by occasional visits of eczema, and
Jack Hamilton, M.L.A., recommended lubri-
cation with a weak solution of salicylic acid.
Now, when Kelland, the Gympie democrat,
looked in at the railway window and briefly
remarked “Bco-hoo !” Tozer was in the attitude
of a Hielanman regaling himself with a pinch of
snuff, the thumb used for applying Hamilton’s
lubricant, and the rest of the hand extended at
the usual angle. Kelland somewhat naturally
assumed that this was a gesture of derision, in-
tended as an affront to the local democracy.
Archelaus, the ancient philosopher, held to the
theory that goats breathe through their ears;
Kelland is of opinion that Tozer conducts satiric
dialogues with his nose. Alas! as old Gariy e
observed, “All war is a misunderstanding!
Tozer is not a man capable of an act of vulgarity
either to an individual or a crowd. I have met
him in joy and sorrow. Last week we were
unusually seasick together on a private open-sea
fishing-excursion. Tozer slipped on a piece of
bait and sat down unexpectedly on the deck, after
throwing up a new Mining Bill, while Morgan,
the Chairman of Committees, unwillingly
accepted several violent notices of motion.

No reporter has yet discovered that Sir
Thomas MTlwraith had a recent narrow escape.
The “Knight of Auchenflower” was down at
Stradbroke Island in the steamer Miner, and
about to leave on the return journey. The Miner
was anchored off the shore, and Thomas started
out to her in a small boat rowed by one of the
crew. A heavy wave capsized-the dingy, and
the Colonial Treasurer, the boatman, and a big
dog were at once wrong end to the zenith. With
a violent effort the boatman'pushed Sir Thomas
into shallow water, with a hazy idea that he was a
strand eel whale (weight 18 stone), and the first
question the noble knight asked was “Where is
the dog?” That faithful collie had mysteriously
disappeared. The boatman swam out, turned
over the boat, and the collie jumped out and swam
ashore as if nothing had happened ! He had begin
safe in the air imprisoned beneath. About 35
years ago a schooner was washed ashore on the
beach south of the Tweed Heads, and old Tom
Boyd and a mate cut a hole in the bottom and
rescued two French sailors, one of whom is still
alive. Sir Thomas swimming ashore with his
Budget speech reminds me of Csesar with his
‘‘Commentaries’’and'Camcens with the “Lusiad.”
Dr. Nisbet, of Townsville, is a son of
W. D. Nisbet. so long and favourably known as
Queensland’s Engineer of Harbours and Rivers.
When this festive Esculapian was a boy he was a
regular patron of circuses, concerts, and other
attractive frivolities where his enthusiasm usually
expressed itself in wild applause with hands and
feet. Once he was sent into the Highlands to
stay with an esteemed old grandmother of the
severest Puritanic school.' He accompanied this
reverend old dame to church, and when the choir
had finished singing “ Old Hundred ” young
Nisbet broke out violently and unexpectedly in a
demonstrative encore ! His grandmother didn’t
live long after that night.
The gaol-regulations at Thursday Island
are based on the moat advanced principles of
humanity. Some of the prisoners stroll about the
island, catch fish, collect botanical specimens, go
to sleep or get drunk with beautiful impartiality.
Yet nobody ever escapes, and no harm is e.ver
done. If you meet anyone there out for a walk,
be careful to ascertain if he is a boarder from the
gaol or a wealthy pearl"fisher.'' Thus the gaoler to
Tommy Abdalla; “Look here, Tommy, if you
are not in by 10 o’clock I’ll lock you out ! ” “ All
right, Massa,” said Tommy ; “ suppose I no drunk,
I come home all right ! ” Some one owed Tommy
a sum of £7 for over a year, and, seeing no pros-
pect of payment, Tommy forged a cheque for £l4
in the name of the debtor. Tommy’s defence was :
“ One year this man he owe me £7 ; he no pay me.
Now, I owe him £7, and no pay him for one year
more ! ” The sublime humour of this financial
transaction was wasted on the local J.P., who sent
Tommy into retirement for six months, but,
during that time, he was so disgusted with the
accommodation of the local gaol that when be
came out he went away indignantly to try <|he
Croydon Bastille, and is probably there at the
present time.

When Colonel Olcott was in Brisbane he
spent a Sunday with me a few miles out of town.
At his special request I gave him an exhibition of
boomerang-throwing, the first he had ever seen,
and he was greatly pleased. Personally he is a
very genial old gentleman and his persuasiveness
is testified to eloquently by the fact that he in-
duced me to write a long article for the Indian
Theosophist on the “ Habits and Superstitions of
the Queensland Blacks.” My reward for that
article is to be hereafter, or even later on, when
“ In India’s realms Elysian ” the genial Colonel
and I are instructing the Mahatmas and the
avenging spirits who are to wipe out the capital-
ists, the Mammon worshippers, the money-lenders,
the fat landlords, the titled loafers and sundry
other unspeakable human abominations who
encumber that beautiful planet we once in-
habited.
# * *
Many a Bulletin reader will learn with
some astonishment that a clergyman who distin-
guished himself in Brisbane in the manipulation
of title-deeds and various financial eccentricities
among confiding parishioners, is now a curate in a
N. S. Wales parish. His name is not in the
Church list, so his bishop, with true modern
Christian consideration, is “keeping him dark”
until, like the virtuous French Louis, he has
“made the amende honorable to God,” and lijved
down the misunderstanding with his Queensland
congregation.

Rev. Mr. Garnsey of Sydney, writing
about the Spurgeon affair, says that he is prepared
to maintain that the Anglican church does not
owe its origin to Henry VIII. Mr. Garnsey, if
he essays to prove that the Anerlican church, as a
Eolitical power, had not its origin in the adulterous
ed of that fat monarch, will have a tough job.
A Big Renunciation.
Prince Albert of Monaco, the proprietor of the
gambling casino at Monte Carlo, has, according
to the cable, renounced £50,000 a year rent and
privilege payments, and is about to convert the
building into a free consumptive hospital. Neerb
less to say the unselfish decision was not all of his
own making. A man rarely rises to such a charity
as this without the advocacy of the step by a
woman he loves and respects, and in this case the.
princess was the dominant factor. £50,000 a year
is an enormous sum and a great power to give
up for the sake of what the good-humoured will
term a chimera, and the envious a fad. It is in
round numbers £250 a day. It represents all that
luxury*could suggest or money buy but life; it
could silence any but the voice of the Last Col-
lector, calling for the payment of his inevitable,
bill, it could-buy off every person orrthing but
death. And so it is a big renunciation, and is
only transcended in the mind; of some, men by
the renunciation of lifb itself. No matter how
fortified one may be with the knowledge of a
happier world, wlure pain is unknown, and from
whence death is for ever banished, the giving up
of friends, parents, sister, brother, husband, wife;
the conviction that the earthly sun is ours for so
short a time, the horror that this, our beloved
body, the dear familiar house of the soul that is a
stranger to us, must go to its matrix before
its time, is a greater pain, and carries a greater
sacrifice than any other in this * world. Even
if prostrated by foreign disease—that is disease
which is eradicable, and there are only one or two
which are not —the memory looks backward to that
dear time when wo had health, and seemed only
made for love and the employment of the sun,
when the golden beams filtered through the sap
green tinted leaves, and we felt that we were part
of that perpetual summer and necessary to it.
The seasons come and go, but we come no more,
and by and bye others who have taken our
prematurely emptied places follow us also before
their time. The most fruitful source of. death is
kidney disease. If the kidneys are kept in sound
working order the blood is maintained in a pure
state, and this being done at least ninety percent,
of diseases, not excepting epidemics, are safely
avoided. Warner’s safe„cure and pills is the only
absolute curative (so far discovered) for this and
kindred disorders. Hundreds of persons with
their feet tottering on the brink of the grave have
been snatched from early death just in time by the
use of the safe remedies, and men of over three
scdrft years, Vvhoke systems were rapidly.breaking
up under the venom of uric acid poison,- have been
restored to sound .health, and many years of
happy useful lives. Warner’s remedies are
absolutely destructive to kidney and liver disease,
and the fact has been proved times out of number.

Society
Sydney Echo objects to Labour-members
who asks literary questions in Parliament. The
Bulletin doesn’t wonder. Parkes has doled out
some good things to people in the office where the
Echo is printed—in fact, judging from the way
his patronage has been exercised, you’d imagine
that the whole literary ability of N.S. Wales was
centred in the Herald office—which is, from the
very nature of it, the last place under Heaven to
look for anybody who is really original and clever.
Mr. Charley Lyne, Parkes’ particular pal (under-
stood to be at the present moment fixing up the old
man’s autobiography), was appointed secretary of
the N.S.W. Public Works’ Committee at £7OO a
year—a salary which has since been added to ;
another Herald man left the Fairfaxes’ service
lately to draw £l2OO a year for compiling a dry-as-
dust history of N.S. Wales from the ancient
records ; yet another Herald man recently
dropped into a Parkesian-Government billet at
£450 a year ; yet another fell on his feet at the
feet of Parkes to the tune of £400; still another
cx-Herald scribe is drawing £950 annually with
more to follow ; only the other day the dear, good
old Premier gave a man £2OO (or guineas) from
the Treasury for doing literary work which lots
of men could do, and do well, inside of four days.
What price the vaunted impartiality of the Press
under such circumstances ?
* # *
Some modest individual who nas borrowed
not the name but only the initials of that clever
and popular artist organist Neville G. Barnet—
or who takes a mean advantage of a coincidence
in initials—writes a long and violent criticism in
Sydney Evening News upon the performances of
City Organist Wiegand. Anybody who knows
Organist Barnet will appreciate the greatness of
this literary error. For the unreasoning public
suffers from an impression that a literary critic
is always a broken-down writer, and that an
art critic is a decayed artist who gave up canvas
and paint because his horses generally had toes,
and his figures had two left legs and no right one;
and in the same way it may think that an organ-
critic is a soured organ-blowtr. And as, in the
present case, they will naturally think that
organist Neville Barnet is the critic in question
—which, to any right-minded person aware
of the cordial relations which always subsist
between truly great professional musicians, is
manifestly impossible —it is all the more
essential that Mr. Barnet should expose the
mistake at once. The News’ writer demands of
the man of European fame, whose organ-playing
delighted the musical centres of civilisation,
“educative” and “progressive” music, also
“pure and reverent treatment,” whatever that
may be, and “ true purity of style,’’ whatever that
may be also, and “ purity of interpretation ” like-
wise, whatever that may be, and when one man
drivels like that over another man’s initials, the
case requires prompt attention. If Mr. Barnet
fails to suppress this other man, people will pre-
sently be suggesting that, after organist Wiegand
playing the kist of whistles and organist Barnet
—for the common herd don’t know any better
writing to the News, fair play demands that
Barnet should play the instrument just once, while
Wiegand writes to the News, and this would
necessarily lead to much ill-feeling. Moreover,
the writer—whoever it is—finishes up by stating
that if Wiegand doesn’t conduct himself properly,
the Evening News will “insist on the necessity”
of something or other, and the sight of that state-
ment, unjustifiably placed above anybody’s initials,
is enough to rouse to frenzy any genuine and
generous artist like Mr. Neville G. Barnet.
* # •
The News seems to be annoyed particu-
larly just here because Wiegand doesn’t always
grind out old, pompous, dryasdust classical
rubbish, in an empty ball, but rather plays
something with a tune in it that the people
can understand, and gets all Sydney for
his audience, and the light and gladsome
character of Mr. Barnet gives the lie to this
theory right off. The people pay for the organ,
and pay to hear the organ, and if they want
“ Yankee Doodle ” on the organ they are going to
have it. Mr. Barnet knows this, and, we are
sure, feels glad in consequence; it is only the man
with the similar initials who can’t see it.

Dear Bulletin, — In re your remarks and
doggerel concerning Mrs. Bi-own-Potter, or, as
she is now, Mrs. Bellew. The “broomstick”
ceremony must have charms for Curly and Cora, if
it be true that they repeat the performance every-
where they go ; for they were “churched” while
in Melbourne—at St. Martin’s temple, South
Yarra, by Rev. Shepherd Ross. Do they “tie
the knot ” occasionally for advertising purposes?

ance of the men on parade. “Why,” he asked

what can be the matter with that young man?”

marry a reporter. The Bulletin is sorry to hear
this. It is sorry for the reporter, first of all,
because he isn’t going to marry Miss Warner.
And it is sorry for Grade Warner in the second
place, for a good action is never thrown away, and
she seems to have lost the chance of doing a
genuine kindness to that reporter. Hie world is
full of wasted opportunities, which never come
ba k any more. We only knew one woman who
ever refused to marry a reporter, and she felt
regretful cibout it ever citterwurds, anci slowly

To show the hideously English condition
of Western Australia we may mention that a
Pertli daily paper has in London a.cableman who
wires it that ‘‘ the drains of the House of Commons
are now in perfect condition.” And the paper
solemnly printed that cablegram !

Things have reached such a pitch in some of
the big Melbourne unlicensed coffee-temples that
boarders now openly bring grog to table. At one
timeliq nor-drinking in these godly places was especi-
allyprohibited by the managements, though almost
every lodger had a trunk-full of whisky in his
bedroom. Under present circumstances, wherein
consists the special virtue of residing in unlicensed
houses? The competition of the coffee-palaces
has so greatly improved hotel-accommodation tin t
the unlicensed “palaces” are being completely
knocked out. It was all very well to be teetotally
virtuous while such virtue paid 10 per cent,
dividends.
* * *
The Bulletin reads with a cynical leer
the Australian and English newspaper-offers made
from time to time, of prizes for stories and
pictures. Most of these are made—according to
the superhuman gall of the man who draws up
the advertisement —for the purpose of “encourage-
ing local talent,” and unearthing some; mute,
inglorious Dickens or Titian who has hitherto
blushed unseen in Bungaree. At least that is
what he says ; what he means, if we may judge
from results, is just this ;
PRIZE COMPETITION.
The owners of the have resolved to offer a
prize of £5O for an Easter tale, and trust that they may
thus turn to profitable account such of their literary
fellow-creatures as are not gifted with arithmetic. They
calculate on receiving, at the lowest estimate, say, 400
good tales, equal to about 2000 columns of reading-
matter, and they will publish pretty nearly the whole lot.
This mass of literature would have cost, say, £lOOO, even
at low rates, hut owing to the lavish generosity of this
paper it saves £950, and gets its name up at the same tune.
It is expressly stipulated that the paper doesn’t pay one
solitary cent for any save the prize tale. In delivering
the prize to the successful competitor the paper will wear
an aspect of wild and boundless munificence, which will
make people think it is giving itself away as a burnt
offering on the altar of literature. Further, there will be
sundry pathetic observations about the weary editor, and
how he has had to toil through a dreary waste of MSS.
He would have had to toil just the same if there hadn't
been any “competition,” for,the old publication has got to
lie filled up every week; but these observations are
heartrending, and arouse commiseration. Full particulars
as to conditions, &c., will be found below.

An overdressed woman, loaded with
jewellery, the other day visited ; the cookery-
classes at Fort-street (Sydney) State school, and
was apparently much pleased at the culinary
accomplishments of the girls. “Ah,” said she,
with a haughty and comprehensive hand-wave,
indicating the cookery-pupils, “we shall soon ’ave
a lot o’ good servants about.” “Excuse me,
madam,” remarked the lady-principal—“ these are
being made into good mistresses.” That is the
great Australian want—good mistresses.

The N.S.W. Prevention of Cruelty to
Children Society have tested the proportions of
the Sydney baby-industry with the result that, out
of 80 applicants for the charge of a suppositious
child, 75 “kind ladies” undertook that it would
“ never be heard of again.” Their fees for a baby.
murder ranged from £3 to £3O, one baby-farmer
demanding £5O for the job. In a Sydney baby-
farm recently, eight helpless children were dis-
covered in a damp cellar in which one could
barely swing a cat round without striking the
walls. That devout political invertebrate, the
N.S.W. Minister for Justice, confesses to an
intimate official knowledge of the baby-farming
business, but he has been too busy to bring the old
hags up with a round turn. In the last 10-years,
62,000 children under the age of five have died in
N.S.W.
* * *
In N.S.W., beyond question, one law
exists for the rich and another for the poor. Ihe
public officials of the province are governed by an
act of Parliament which says that no officer under
the age of 60 shall be retired on a pension, unless
on the ground of some infirmity of health. Last
year the son of an ex-Speake_r of the N.o.W.
Assembly was retired on a pension of £l9O m his
40th year, on the ground, it is said, of “ loss of
memory. 1 ’ So far so good ! But this Herculean-
built gentleman is shortly heard of on ’Change as a
broker; and a month or two later as a candidate
for Parliamentary honours —of course, in the in-
terests of Freetrade and Parkes. The Bulletin
rises to suggest that a man whose memory is good
enough to recollect the virtues of Foreign-trade,
is also good enough to serve the public in his
former station ; and that, if he will not respond
to the call of the Civil Service Board to return to
his billet, the Civil servants should be relieved of
the incubus of supplementing his screw.

Australian art item, from the London
Art Journal :
In Australia the happy idea has been hit upon by the
president, Mr. E. L. Montefiore, of illustrating, in water-
colours, the scenery of N.S.W., its coasts, the rivers,
lakes and mountains. The Art Gallery have opened a
competition in the matter, and invite drawings of these
subjects, to be submitted to them not later than the end
of next November, and they announce their resolution,
should these he good enough, to purchase a dozen at £o>
each. Unfortunately there is hardly time for an English
artist to enter the lists, otherwise a good one might not
only sweep the board, hut probably make his journey
remunerative by other sales.
Of course he might. A British editor never takes
in the possibility of there being even one decent
Australian artist in existence, nor does be allow
for the fact that good British artists are more or
less scarce at present, and that British art galleries
are considerably filled up by French painters,
to make up for the terrible decadence of the
local article. Also he never ran against
a ° snag in the shape of an Australian
board of judges, which might also disarrange
his calculation. Further he forgets that the
British artist paints everything bright, green,
and when the latter struck this brown and yellow
laud, with its sky of glaring blue, and its sun of
brass, he would probably be a flabbergasted
sinudger, and long ere lie got the hang of
things the competition would be over. Most
likely he would paint Australia green, and then
the board of judges would heave him out.
England is rich with the grass that grows on the
dead man’s grave ; and no Australian can there
look upon the sward without thinking of worms
and corruption, for the land is crowded up, and
underneath every clod some forgotten sepulchre
is helping the vegetation along ; and the artist
who has been trained in that school can’t paint
the drought-stricken plains and the murky bush.
He would only burst if he made the attempt, and
take a steerage passage home, leaving his canvases
and his shabby check clothes in pawn with
Abraham—if Abraham dared to advance anything
upon them. Egotism, thy name is J. Bull!

Cheeks with the flush of pear,
Eyes with a rogueish stare,
Lips panting “ if you dare
Surely you’ll rue
Graceful the pace of her,
Winning the grace of her,
Charming the face of her,
Really too-too.
Limbs like a mountain pine,
Arms like a clinging vine.
Hands I would clasp in mine,
Waist I’d ensnare;
Rapture ! the beam of her
Eyes, and the gleam of her
Clieeks, and the dream of her
Tremulous hair !
Teeth behind red lips lie
White as the fleecy sky,
Smile chasing smile and sigh
Over her face;
Heavens! the dip of her
Waist, and tin trip of her
Ueet, and the hip of her
Pen cannot trace !
Tootseys with tapered too.
Ankles, a vision— oh
Sin to he writing so—
Sinful but true:
See how they stare at her.
Eye-glasses bear at her,
Old fogies glare at her,
Young fogies, too.
Womanly, twenty-three,
Maidenly, fancy free,
Who can this angel be,
Young and so fair?

Detective Charles Abbott, killed by a
vehicle-accident at North Shore, on Sunday last,
was the officer attached to theN.S.W. General
Post-office, and had been the means of convicting
many a man guilty of the society-destroying
offence of letter-stealing. He had quarters in the
big building, and had of late been very apprehen-
sive that the noise of the great clock which is
being placed in position in the tower would

Four books, with Queen Victoria’s auto-

From both houses of the N.S.W. Parlia-

fusion, on account of the unsavory subject under
discussion. Attorney-General Simpson's refer-

two fair stenographers beat a hasty retreat from
the Council; while Davis, M.P., unwittingly per-
petrated a double entendre in the Assembly, and
some ladies behind the bar ran away from the

‘‘Our Pleasant Yices,” an Australian
story from the bright pen of Milner Mac Master,
the Melbourne Daily Telegraph writer who,
over the pen name of “Viator,” was about the
onlv Melbourne writer of consequence who took a
democratic view of the position and had a good
and humane word for Labour during the late
strike, will shortly be published by a London firm
in cheap form. It is sure to be worth reading.
There is a barn-like Methodist Church in
a Melbourne suburb which has an average congre-
gation of fifty—morning and evening services in-
cluded. The adherents are not millionaires—far
from it, but there is one loyal and liberal member
(who owns a timber-yard, and any number of
houses) who is the mainstay of the Bethel, and
whose devout “Amins,” accompanied by a
peculiar snort, are well known. In fact, he is a
downright generous supporter. It is alleged that
he donates 12s. to the collection every Sunday,
not in coin but I.O.XJ.’s. It must be borne in
mind that the long-suffering pastor of the barn-
like church lives in a house in an evil-smelling side
street, said house belonging to the rich member.
At the end of the quarter, matters are squared up,
1.0.U.’s taken into account, and the balance (not
much) after the rent is docked, handed over tithe
church-treasurer. “The Lord loveth a cheerful
giver.” There was a public meeting in the church
one evening, and the liberal member addressed a
few words to the assembled multitude. In
the course of his rambling utterances, he said that
he had had a “ vision,” in which he handed over
something like £3OO, that being about half the
amount due on the church and parsonage, pro-
viding the congregation “visioned” the other
half. There was not the slightest prospect of the
latter being accomplished, and the chairman of
the meeting suggested that the liberal member
should go home and have another “vision,” so as
to make up the whole amount. However, up to
the present, The Bulletin learns that no further
“ visions ” have been indulged in, and the dimly-
lighted sacred edifice, with its sad and forlorn-
looking congregations, pursues the same old, even
tenor of its way, and the liberal member (who, by
the way, owns a couple of pubs.) still drops Ids
1.0.U.’s into the plate, and still deducts the rent
of the house in the eUI-smelling street. Will it
be written of him that he hath “done all the good
that he could,” or “ he might have done more if
lie would?”
Round the Shops and Shows,
Without a doubt, the best ladies’ dining-
room in Sydney is the City Buffet, corner of
Margaret and George streets. This handsome
room opens off the main street, and has the
advantage of being on a level with the street —a
convenience which is much appreciated by the
ladies. A splendid dinner is served at a cost of
Is. upwards, and, as the table appointments and
attendance are also excellent, the popularity of
the room is only what can be expected.

Since Princess Beatrice included the art
of photography amongst her pursuits, it has been
one of the most fashionable pastimes adopted by
young ladies and gentlemen in both England and
other parts of the world. The youth of Sydney
have not been slow in having themselves initiated
in the mysteries of this interesting art, for our
young amateur photographers number “quite a
crowd.” Time was, however, when in Sydney
the necessary paraphernalia meant so large a sum
of money, that it debarred scores from indulging
in this useful and fascinating accomplishment, but
since Messrs. Baker and Rouse have come amongst
us, they offer a photographer’s outfit at so trifling
an outlay that it is within the reach of all. This
firm (successors to Messrs. Lichtner and Co.) have
cameras in all sizes, from the tiny “Detective”
upwards, and are to be found at 375 Geprge-street.

Pending the erection of their new premises
in Pitt-street, Messrs. E. Way and Company have
removed to 448 George-street, late Messrs. Pain
and Webb and Co., and directly opposite Messrs.
Lassetter’s, where they have a magnificent display
of spring goods. These temporary premises have
been fitted up on a most liberal scale, the show-
rooms being the most spacious and best-lighted
in Sydney. On the same floor as the show-rooms,
cosy apartments have been reserved for ladies’
“ fitting-on rooms and on the next floor are the
numerous workrooms, always filled with busy
workers. As Messrs. E. Way and Company made
a clearance of their old stock before entering their
George-street premises, it follows that all the
goods they are now showing are the latest im-
portations. They have also opened a branch of
their well-known mourning and underclothing
departments at 430 George-street, next to the
Book Arcade. This Firm has been too long and
favourably known to the Sydney public to necessi-
tate a detailed notice of their many excellent
qualities. Suffice it to say—and this speaks
volumes—they do the biggest drapery business in
Sydney. # # #
Amongst the attractions in the new Arcade
is the “ Imperial Refreshment Room,” conducted
by Mrs. Ridout. Here one can have an excellent
cup of tea with bread and butter and pastry.
Fruit and cream, and the best of sweets are other
specialities at this establishment —in fact, every-
thing in the way of light refreshment is here
offere d. Good attendance is also guaranteed.

The Ladies’ Self Help Institute has been

benefit their own sex.

All honour to the man who invents a
labour-saver for women. “McFie’s cold-water
soap ” economises both time, fire, and labour and
turns the ever-dreaded washing-day into a day of
pleasure. Its advantages over other soaps are
numerous. In using it for washing clothes no fire
is necessary, no rubbing is required, and the
hands, instead of becoming hardened, become soft
and white. The price is just a fraction over that
of common soap, and it can be bought from any
grocer.

Sydney Echo prints “Facts Focussed.”
Probably a misprint for “ Hocussed.”
An alleged humorous paper, published in
Melbourne, has lately got rid of its editor, who
was the only humorous thing about it, even in its
best days. His proceedings scared the proprietors
Into fits, and the paper is now run by a species of
retired undertaker upon orthodox lines. The old
editor had a turn for poetry, and once a week he
used to blast an appropriate couplet out of him-
self, and issue it along with the weekly cartoon,
and gently label it Byron, or Shakespeare, or even
Homer. He generally did these brief poems in a
tramcar, or he would think them out while running
for a train. Sometimes, by way of variety, he
would issue a mass of hieroglyphics that looked
like a centipede drinking on a barbed-wire fence,
and put underneath the words : “ Obscure Persian
Legend.” But one day, towards the end of his
career, he published a frenzied blast of metre in
two lines, and described it as by “ Sappho,
ancient Greek poetess,” and then a deeply-out-
raged professor came down to the office and
remonstrated. “ You must be aware, Mr. ,”
lie said, sternly, “that the works of Sappho are
entirely lost, and this is mere disreputable fooling
with the great names of antiquity.” The editor
never turned a hair. He only smiled a heavenly
smile and explained. “I know,” he said, “that
the writings of Sappho are supposed to have been
lost, but this single verse was given by her to an
ancestor of mine, and has been handed down in
the family ever since. It is now revealed to the
world for the first time.” Then there was a long
pause, in fact, the pause has been going on ever
since, and is still in good working order.
A final consignment of blackleg shearers
was started along from Melbourne the other day
to be transhipped to the wild and woolly west.
There were about 50 of them, almost all dressed
in the cheap and slimy black togs and the
squashed and mangled hat to which the city-
rowdy is addicted. Six dwarfs, all very drunk —
one intoxicated hunchback, and a knock-kneed
giant whose limbs spread out at an obtuse angle on
each side of him—were the conspicuous features of
the show. He was a reposeful sort of giant, with
a big, dreary countenance, and every time the
caravan stopped in its progress along the plat-
form he would flop down on anything that was
handy. Once he sat on a truckful of baggage, and
a porter started to wheel him away, but some one
ran after him and reclaimed him. It was raining
furiously, and the little man who was in charge of
the consignment rushed about in a sodden state,
and made frantic efforts to verify them by his list
as they came through a wicket. “Here, you
don’t belong to this lot,” he said, as a nigger
shoved past, bent on a free ride, but the mob
behind rushed the nigger through with a yell and
a curse, and swept him into the carriage.
Then the man in charge looked through the
window at the damp, blasphemous crowd, and
tried to count them, but failed. A powerful
smell of muddy swags and foul boots per-
vaded the premises, and a stream of cheerful pro-
fanity poured out over the station. Finally, they
got under weigh, and expectorated out of the
windows all the way to Seymour. At that place
the joyous “ free labourer ” swamped the refresh-
ment-room, and filled the atmosphere with cries
for coffee and pie—“pie, blast you, pass along
some crimson pie; where’s the gory vittles?” The
barmaid fled in confusion, and the mob howled
and seethed and tramped around with elephantine
feet, and reached for the food over other people’s
shoulders, and raised Cain generally. The small
man hung around the outskirts of the tumult, and
counted his flock over again, and found that he
was supplying pie and coffee to about eight more
than the right number. Then he “shoo’d’’them
back into the train and counted them again—
result, six men short. Consequence, fourteen pies
unaccounted for. He found the knock-kneed man
and one intoxicated dwarf at the back of the
station, and fished out the lost hunchback from
behind a truck ; but the nigger, who had howled
the loudest of all in the refreshment-room,
was gone, and so were two more. From
.Seymour to Benalla the crowd still expec-
torated out of the carriage window and
blasphemed, and threw out empty bottles as
before. They were counted again at Benalla—
two more gone—making a total shortage of five.
Presumably they had either evaporated, or escaped
through the window. The others had their muddy
boots on the seat and -were still objurgating
violently, and a good deal of varnish had been
damaged. At Wodonga the shortage had got up
to seven, and getting away from this place one
man put his head out of the window, and cast reflec-
tions on the morals of the entire female popula-
tion. At Albury the agent counted them again
in the refreshment-room and found 12 more than
there were at the beginning—there were just 43
visible and reliable men when the train came in,
and here were 62 swallowing the provender, and
clawing madly for the drinkables, and using
choice language all over the place. While he was
thinking over this discrepancy one of them acci-
dentally charged him in the stomach with the full
weight of his swag, and he gave up. When the
train started once more there were just 41. One
of the absentees was visible on the platform as the
crowd rolled away, but he was in a stooping
posture with his back to the astonished agent, and
his coat-tails over his head. Possibly this atti-
tude was intended to express disrespect. Finally
the whole assortment disembarked at Junee, at
2.30 a.m. It was cold and pitch-dark and raining
in torrents, but by the light of the porter’s lantern
the consignment was once more verified among the
slush; and when the train plunged off on its
weary way into a darkness that was like 10,000
black cats, the tally had got down to 37, and stuck
there.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
“ Well, you see,” said Larry Foley, “it’s only
to be expected that a man that isn’t doing much would
take on flesh pretty thick—you know. But I was in real
.food fettle that time Simonetti did my bust, you know.”
“Your bust, Larry? Why, I never heard about it.”
“Oh yes, but it wasn't for me, it was for the bishop—you
know, they'd got his head all right, but they wanted to
fix it up so's it ’ud fit well on to a good bust—you know,
so they come to me and, of course, it was a fair deal—you
know, and it come out all right, because everybody said
it was the deadjspit of the bishop—you understand.”
And then an irreverent joker remarked that things had
got mixed up too much and shifted end for end as it
were, and that Larry’s head on the shoulders of a bishop
would do the world a lot more good than the other way
about-you know —and five drinks concluded the business
of the sitting.

In Timbs’ “ Century of Anecdote ” it is recorded
that the Duke of Wellington, when assailed by the crowd on
pig return from the Tower during the Reform Bill excite-
ment, had a very narrow escape. A young man in a gig
kept close to the Duke’s horse the whole way through the
city in such a manner as to completely guard one side.
He never once looked up, nor had the air or manner of
one who was doing anything out of the way, and we
believe he remains to this day almost unknown, though the
greatest disgrace that could have fallen on the nation was
in all human probability averted by him. It leaked out
some years before his death that this young man was none
other than the somewhat eccentric landlord of the
John Bull tavern, Little Collins-street, Melb., the late
William Barton. The “Kitchen Doctor,” as he was
called, had a varied and somewhat stormy experi-
ence. By birth and' apprenticeship he was a freeman of
the city of London, belonging to the Cordwainers Guild
—and at the time of the excitement over the Reform Bill
was in business as a leather-cutter in Red Cross-street,
Cripplegate Within. This business he disposed of to
enter upon the management of the Rosemary Branch
Garden at Islington. At these gardens he had under
engagement to him Pablo Panque and Tom Barry, the
famous clown, who afterwards visited Australia. At the
Gardens, after four or five years’ occupancy, Barton
was unfortunate, the pavilion, capable of holding
5000 people, circus stables, kennels, horses, dogs and
other exhibits being destroyed by fire. Not having a
penny of insurance on the concern, and all his worldly
wealth being in the venture, Barton, almost penniless,
but full of pluck, emigrated to Victoria, where lie arrived
in the early fifties, engaging in mining at Forest Creek
(now Castlemaine), and various other occupations until
he finally “camped” in Little Collins-street. Barton was
intimately acquainted with the old school of boxers and
theatricals. The snug parlour of his hostelry was always
sought after by old Londoners and others who delighted
in hearing repeated the doings of the “fancy.” Barton
had a wonderful memory and a fund of anecdote not
possessed by many other men of his day in Melbourne.
He bad seen all the great actors from Kemble to Barry
Sullivan, and gave it as his opinion that “Little Edmund
Kean” outstripped them all. In comedy he believed in
Robson, in singing, Braham, and in boxing, Jem Ward,
Young Dutch Sara and Dick Curtis.

The social meeting which took place in America
between Sullivan and Slavin, reminds us of a little narra-
tive by the Tipton Slasher, page 1001 of “ Pugilistica-” :
“ Yer see, the honly meetin’ that ever took place ’atween
Plummy Joe and Balloon was of a most rummy character.
They sot down together in the bar parler, all by their-
selves, and wuz most cheerful. All of a suddent, and
neither of ’em never knowed ’ow it occurred, there was
sich a smashin’ and a crashin as never you heerd in yer
born days. Heverythink in the plaice was smashed. It
all happened in the twinklin’ of a heye. When friends
rushed in, there wuz the two settin’ as companionable as
hever.”

Spagnoletti: “ I saw old Billy Lang to-day,
driving a load of potatoes, from his Ascot Vale Farm,
through Melbourne. Who’s he ? Billy was the crack
jock, of 30 years ago, and more, owner of Flying Jib and
that sort, rival of Sam. Waldock, who had the finest
hands, but Lang had the best cling—to existence, any-
how. He has wrapped his legs, like those of a Fred.

Jere Dunn, the grey-headed, white-whiskered
man who refereed the Slavin-Kilrain bash, is the man who
stalked Elliott, the short-sighted pug. and sworn-off bank
burglar, and to finish a feud shot him “sitting” in
Chicago. Dunn took steady aim at Elliott at five yards’
range from shelter of a screen while his victim was feed-
ing in a Chicago restaurant. Elliott, who had no warning
from his assassin, nearly settled Dunn after being
wounded, and got his gun from him, but was stretched
out with a second revolver, which the other well-knowm
sport had laid on. The facts were abundantly proved in
court, but the defence had more influence and money to
spend than the prosecution, and Dunn got through.

A cold-blooded American journalist writes that
olavin “has not a prize-fighter’s face, but is a man who

that he didn’t approve of the lunacy alluded to, but
couldn t prevent “ the law 7 from taking its course.”

, Melbourne men met with little success at
the Sydney Harriers sports of last Saturday on the Asso-
ciation Ground, only running into the barren honour of
places. The racing provided a number of close finishes
and several dead heats, and in the three-mile race
: ’airytuple put up the Australian record, 16min. ssec.,
though had Corner made the pace stronger during the
last three laps he would probably have wiped out the
eight yards that separated them at the finish. The day
was fine, and all the youth and beauty of Sydpey pimpled

Now that the English cricketers are coming out
once more to this beknighted land, we have little doubt
that Australian democracy will be annoyed and insulted
to see some paid players, Grace to wit, labelled “Mister,”
while others paid less largely are simply styled Tom,
Dick and Harry. In the cricket-field at least surely all
men are equal. The greatest satire on the “gentleman”
qualifications was supplied by the brothers Daft ; one
played as a gentleman, the other as a professional. Both
had been brought up in precisely the same manner.

THE STRONGEST ARGUMENTS
A recent issue of the Wolverhampton
Chronicle contains the following: “We have
for a long time heard various reports of the
wonderful effects produced by the use of St.
Jacobs oil in chronic cases which had been given
up as incurable, but had always supposed these
were enlarged upon for advertising purposes, like
all other patent or proprietary medicines, but the
reports from all our leading chemists must be
considered one of the strongest arguments which
can be advanced respecting the value of any lead-
ing article of trade in their line. The uniformity
of these reports will be noted at once. All speak
in the highest terms of the value of St. Jacobs oil
as an outward application for pain. The oil is
only advertised to cure rheumatism, neuralgia,
gout, sciatica, and those bodily pains where an
outward application is used. The proprietors of
this popular remedy never advertise the oil to
cure those diseases which it will not actually cure.
By so doing they have gained the confidence of
the people. We see by the Liverpool papers that
St, Jacobs oil is used largely on board of nearly
every steamship that sails from that port. Many
companies, including the Cunard, White Star,
and some of the South American lines, do not
even consider their ships ready for sea unless a
sufficient supply of this popular remedy is on
board to last the voyage. Latterly we are in-
formed that all H.M. troopships leaving Ports-
mouth take a large supply of the oil on board.
The oil in yellow wrappers for veterinary purposes
is being used with equally good results by the
leading omnibus and cab companies of London
a nd provincial cities for use on horses for sprains,
sore shoulders, and general ailments where an
embrocation is required.
“A leading article in a recent issue of the
Chemist and Druggist stated that St. Jacobs
Oil had the largest sale of any medicine in the
world; and when an article possesses the actual
merit which St. Jacobs Oil undoubtedly does
possess, the proprietors are entitled to receive the
benefit of the enormous sale which this popular
remedy has.”
DRAWBACKS.
The electric light is a glorious institution, so is
a donkey race, or a mince pie, an aperient pill,
or a pledge of affection ; but they all have their
little drawbacks, as the proprietors of each or any
of them have but too often realised. They are
all convenient at times, and occasionally comfort-
ing, but the electric light, in addition to being
jerky and unreliable, is unfair to women. The
loveliest of her sex doesn’t show to advantage in its
glare; but soon gets accustomed to it, and learns the
precise shades of color, both for complexion and
costume, that will blend into a soulful harmony be-
neath it, and defy spiteful comment. Masculine
beauty prefers it to daylight, for, though search-
ing it is likewise secretive, by reason of its
attendant shadows, which will help a convicted
thief or a bigamist to pass for an apostle, and
substitute an expression of pensive thought for the
drivelling imbecility produced by colonial whisky
at Is. 6d. a bottle. It is better than candles in
many respects, and inferior to limelight in others,
but it will probably never get as firm a hold on the
affections of the people as its humble congener, the
fat lamp, than which, however, it is less aggressive
in perfume, though far more costly and difficult
of attainment. The fat lamp is man’s trustworthy
and permanent friend wherever there is a pint pot,
a piece of rag, and a pound of loin chops; the
electric light is at the disposal of an engineer who
may be the object of a domestic tyranny which
unmans him during the hours of darkness, or the
subject of an influenza that nothing but onions
boiled in beer will alleviate. Luxene, the new
illuminant, has none of these disadvantages and
no others. It is simply perfect from all points of
study, and —better than all else—it is absolutely
safe to use. The most timid mother can rely on
finding her children in bed when she returns from
a short visit to a neighbor, and the lamp (turned
low) will illuminate the peaceful scene she left an
hour before and there will be no fire and wreckage
to illustrate the story of her absence. Take
note of this and ask for confirmation from

The London & Sydney Tea Go. supply squatters

By way of reducing the deficiency a little?
the Victorian authorities propose, in future, to
make every lighthouse-keeper pay rent for his
lighthouse, on the ground that he is supplied with
“ quarters,” and thereby gets an advantage over
other public servants who have to find their own
quarters. It’s a wonder they don’t also charge
board to people in gaol. The rate proposed is
about 10s. a week, which seems pretty steep for
the privilege of living in a stone funnel in a
wilderness of sea and cold grey stones, with
neither a newspaper nor a drink anywhere within
twenty miles or more. It is a melancholy job at
the best to run a lighthouse. Life there consists
chiefly of polishing up the old reflector by day and
keeping an eye on the lantern glare at night, and
in his leisure time the keeper thinks about the
lizards and the damp, or walks around on the
shore jumping on crabs, or else sits and looks out
of his weary eye, amid his uncut hair, at the same
old, green sea that is always there. When his
hair is cut at all he has to do it himself, and he
looks after his own clean shirt, and repairs his
own leg when it is broken, and darns his own
socks, and pulls out his teeth when they ache.
Ten shillings a week seems pretty stiff for a
domicile under these circumstances, with no bath-
room, and no water laid on, and no gas-fittings,
cornices, front garden, or trams passing the door
—with nothing at all, in fact, except a round stone
hole and a hunk of the illimitable ocean.
The legion cures performed by the patented
treatment of the Bethel Electric Medical Baths
Co., Lonsdale-street, Melbourne, increase with the
advent of every new disease treated thereat. A
Sandhurst man, who had been totally blind
through optical paralysis, had his vision restored
to him after six baths, and a lady—a martyr to
rheumatism for six years—has been enabled to
walk after being under treatment for about three
weeks. There is not the slightest doubt that a
prssage'of electricity through diseased tissues
arrests decay and re-tones the whole system, as
dozens of cases have authoritatively evidenced.
And when it is remembered that the process is
more pleasurable than otherwise—that “ the
medicine, in fact, is a sweetmeat”—the tre-
mendous spread of the Company’s business is not
at all to be wondered at. Dr. H. B. Wilson, the
medical superintendent, personally supervises the
force of the currents in the dynamo-room, and
attendants of both sexes are to hand in the various
bathrooms. Altogether, the Bethel Electric
Baths must be considered the wonder, and at the
same time the saviour of the health, of this age.
The Co-Operative Irrigation Colonies.
The Victorian Government spends rather
over £lOO,OOO per annum on printing solemn
literature, departmental reports, and pompous
statistics of all sorts. One of their joyous publxa-
tions is the report of the Reformatory Schools
and Neglected Children’s department—a big
annual volume in which the State reproduces the
letters of little Tommy, the typical infant who is
boarded out by the authorities, to his drunken
mother; and similar information. Here is a
sample :
Dear Mother,—l write these few lines hoping to find
you well, and not as you were before. I hope that God
will protect you till I return again. Mind and keep out
of danger, and I will never forget you as long as I live.
Mind 3'our religion, and don’t drink beer. lam going to
school every day. lam third in the class at M . I
have a comfortable house, and plenty of food. Trust in
God, and wait till I return. Your Lovixa Sox.
There are several dozens of these in each issue of
this famous blue-book, and little Tommy snuffles
in every one of them. Why the State pays for
publishing the correspondence of the oily moral
infant who is boarded out, goodness only knows.
But the letters are all so much alike that we are
half inclined to suspect that the department is its
own infant, or rather that there is no infant at all,
and the officials get up the correspondence them-
selves to show the good that is being done under
their supervision, and pass it off as being written
by a reformed and beautiful child with a neglected
nose, who is sorrowing for his ma.

OF THE
Melbourne Hotel Company,
STRAHAN, TASMANIA.
(To he Registered No-Liability.)
CAPITAL :
£12,01K), in 12,001) Shares of £1 Each.
Payable as follows : —Five Shillings per Share ou
Application; Five Shillings per Share on
Allotment; and the Balance by Calls, the
First Call not to be made earlier than Six
Months after Allotment of Shares.
This company is being formed for the purpose
of buying from William Dixon, Esq., a portion
of land situate at Strahan, West Coast of Tas-
mania, containing 1 rood 31 perches, and erecting
a most substantial Hotel and Store thereon. Title
perfect.
The object of the company in buying this
valuable land and building a Hotel on the same,
is, that a Hotel of this class in this particular
district is indispensable, and that people of all
classes going to and from those wonderful mines
in Tasmania—Zeehan, Dundas, and Mount Lyell,
&c.— must necessarily pass the above-mentioned
Hotel.
The proposed building is to consist of Forty-
five Bedrooms, all well-ventilated, Sitting-rooms,
Drawing-rooms, Billiard-room, Bar 18 x 24, and
to possess all conveniences connected with a
Modern Hotel. The Kitchen will be on the
ground floor, connecting with the Dining-room, so
that no inconvenience will be experienced in the
delivery of ineals. A verandah Bft. wide will run
almost around the entire building.
The structure, when completed, will command a
prominent position in Strahan, also a most exten-
sive view of Macquarie Harbour, the scenery of
which is unsurpassed; being also in the very
midst of every conceivable sport a tourist could
wish for—Shooting, Fishing, Yachting, Boating,
&c.
The proposed structure will be about six chains
from the sea, where a bathing place, from one
inch to fifty feet, can be acquired.
It is proposed that W. Dixon, Esq., owner of
the within-mentioned land, shall receive £5OO
cash, and 1000 shares paid up to 10s. for the said
land, and that the building shall be of brick, and
shall not cost more than £OOOO.
The expenses of flotation will be borne by the
company, and the company will be declared
formed when application for 6000 shares has been
made.
The special attention of investors is directed to
the fact that the district in which the within-
mentioned Hotel is to be built is unsurpassed,
being a most salubrious climate, and admirably
suited for invalids ; also, the tourist can have
every enjoyment conceivable. The population of
Strahan and surrounding district is about 8000.
In conclusion, we would again draw special atten-
tion to the fact that there is no other outlet pos-
sible from Zeehan, Dundas, Mount Lyell, &c.,
except through the seaport of Strahan, and past
the proposed Hotel, which will be in the closest
possible proximity to the Zeehan-Dundas Railway
Station and Terminus,
All money received for application of shares
will be placed to the credit of the company in the
Commercial Bank, Melbourne; and, if no allot-
ment is made, the deposit money will be returned
without any deduction whatever.

258 Drummond-st., Carlton, May 13, 1891.
Mr< Wm. Dixon, Osborne House,
N icholson-street.
Dear Sir, —At your request, on my return from
reporting on various properties on the West Coast
of Tasmania, I made another special inspection of
your corner allotment No. 1, situate at the town or
seaport of Strahan, Macquarie Harbour, and in
close proximity to the terminus of Zeehan, Dundas
and Strahan line of railway. As I have before
informed you, it is without doubt the best situa-
tion in the locality to build a Hotel and Store
that can be desired. There being now no doubt
as to the stability and every day increasing
returns of the Zeehan and Dundas silver fields,
or the “Tasmanian Broken Hill;” and, speak-
ing without prejudice, and as a frequent visitor
since 1886, backed by every other expert and
the present and ex-Government geologists and
mining inspectors, etc., I confidently recom-
mend this property for investment, and should
you determine to make a company, I am preparer}
to take my share. The salubrity of this climate is
at all times unsurpassed. Protected by Native
from every wind (winter or summer), and as a
summer resort for invalids or the tourist, it cannot
be denied no place in the Australian colonies can
surpass it. Its pure atmosphere and splendid
natural drainage makes it a safe anchorage from
the ailments subject to the natural body. The
tourist can satisfy his every fancy. The scenery
of Macquarie Harbour is unsurpassed—in point
of fact an inland sea, beaming in beauty ; its
islands, its vast mountain rivers, and silver
streams, studded with foliage of every description.
The Gordon River, to wit, upon its charming
banks; the towering forests and marble cliffs
150fc., and the inland side behold the trickling
stream and gurgling torrent descending into
many a deep ravine and abyss below ; then,
onward still, and the noble Gordon takes you up to
the settlement of 100 years ago, &c. I could
expatiate a week oh the marvels of Creation
visible there. The visitor can have every enjoy-
ment-fishing (supply wonderful of every kind),
shooting (wild fowl), &c., &0., and a natural
bathing-place—about six chains from allotment—
from lin. to 50ft. I strongly recommend you to
build a hotel costing from £3OOO to £5000.* Just
consider—material on ground, an ever-increasing
population, close to railway, close to steamer, no
position like it, and not half accommodation for
travelling public. The population is now about
8000, including surrounding district, and no other-
outlet. It is a fortune to build a suitable place.
In conclusion, there is no outlet for Mount Lyell,
Mounts Zeehan, Dundas, &c., &c., except through
Strahan,
I am, yours truly,

NOBODY WANTS THAT GOLD RING.
For nearly 100 years a certain family of vvorking
people living in Pans have ended their lives by
suicide. From father to son, from mother to
daughter, has descended a plain gold ring, and on
the linger of every one of these suicides, as they
lay in death, this ring has been found. Only last
year the body of a young man who had killed
himself was brought to the Morgue, and on his
linger was the fatal golden circlet, he was the
last of his race. The ring was buried with the
corpse, from which no one acquainted with its
history will have the courage to remove it.
The mental taint in this family came from some
remote ancestor, and was intensified by their
recognition of it until it became a controlling
force : and the ring was accepted as imposing upon
its possessor the obligation to commit suicide,
after the example of the nersqn who last wore it.
This form of mania usually originates in a disorder
of the nervous system, which'in its turn arises
from anaemia, or poverty of the blood, one of the
results of imperfect nutrition.
A recent letter from a gentleman living in Nor-
folk contains the following assertion : “ J longed
for death; I was afraid of the night; I was afraid
to he alone, yet I hated society. I was afraid that
in some one of these hours oj deep gloom and depres-
sion I should lift my hand against my own life, for
I knew that many had done so from the same cause.”
The dark hours became a time of terror to him, so
he says. He tossed and tumbled on his bed,
wondering if morning would ever dawn again. In
this case it was not an accusing conscience, as he
had committed no offence ; the cause was purely
a physical one —yet, all too common in England—
indigestion and dyspepsia, with the long chain of
consequences dragging after it, nervous collapse
among them. .
He relates that his skin and eyes had been more
\>r less discoloured for years, often of a ghastly
j a d repulsive yellow. This was due to the presence
of bile in the blood and tissues, where it had no
business to be. But as the weak and torpid liver
could not remove it, no other result was possible
than the one our friend experienced. His head
frequently ached as though fiends had turned it
into a workshop, and pains chased one another
through his body as though he had at least half
the maladies catalogued in the popular books of
disease.
Yet one thing, and one only, was responsible
for all the mischief, namely, the poison introduced
into the blood from the decaying food in the
stomach and intestines. Ihe cold feet, the loss
of appetite and ambition, the mental despondency,
the sense of weariness and fatigue, the bad taste
iu the mouth, dry cough, giddiness, palpitation,
chills, weakness, &c., are a brood of foul birds
hatched in one nest, and the mother is always
indigestion and dyspepsia.
Time passed somehow, as it always does,
whether we laugh or cry, and this man grew
heartily tired of a life thus burdened and spoiled.
He longed to see the end of it, and no wonder.
But the last page of his letter is pitched in a
higher key. He says, “ When I think of what
I was, and what I. am now, I can hardly realise
the change. For the past six months I have been
using a preparation known as Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup, and it has actually revolutionised
my whole system. One of my tenants recom-
mended it to me, and I tried it just to please him.
Now I praise it for myself, and thank the men
who made and advertise it. My troubles are over,
and I feel (at 57) as light, elastic, and gay as a
boy on his summer vacation. I tell my doctors
they are beaten at their own trade by an old
German nurse, and so far as I am concerned they
can’t deny it. I have no more horrible thoughts
of self-destruction, for I find too much enjoyment
in living. My thanks are too deep for words.”
The author of this letter consents to the pub-
lication of so much of it as is here printed, but
declines to allow the use of his name, at least for
the present, for reasons we are bound to respect.
But the evident sincerity of his story will carry
conviction to every candid mind.

The Fourness Lamp, unlike most of the
so-called regenerative lamps, is, from first to last,
the actual manufacture of the company. The
undoubted advantage of this is that every part is
subjected to rigid scrutiny, and finished in the
best possible manner. The Fourness Lamp
claims to be absolutely perfect in its brilliant
purity and steady intensity of light. There is_no
downward shadow or reflection. It is simplicity
itself to light and clean, is readily fixed to exist-
ing supply pipes, and yields more than treble the
results obtained by ordinary methods of lighting,
with less gas consumption. It is smokeless, and
only gives out a heat sufficient to insure thorough
ventilation and absolute purity of atmosphere.
The security it affords from danger of fire, has
made it a general favourite with the Insurance
Companies. The Company is actively engaged in
producing the new Shadowless Bracket or Burner,
a light specially adapted for shops, offices, and
private houses complete in itself, and can be easily
secured to any existing brackets, pendants or
chandeliers by merely removing the burner, in
place of which it may be fixed in a moment with-
out even the aid of a gasfitter. It is little inferior
to the large Pendant Lamp and elegant in appear-
ance, consumes but little gas in comparison with
the immense volume of light given and is smoke-
less, cool, and simple in construction.
Nat Levi, the Melbourne advertising
agent, has recklessly offered himself to hi**
adopted country (from the hustings) on severa 1
occasions, but the goal of his ambition seems to get
further away each time. The large majority of
the constituents display a fatuous desire to hurl
their votes and interest at the other fellows, and
when the returning-officer comes forth with a
sheet of paper in his nervous grasp, the announce-
ment of Nat’s discomfiture is accepted with patient
resignation and an ironical guffaw. The other
week, when Mr. Pitt was returned for Beaney’s
old seat in the Council, poor Nathaniel was so
hopelessly beaten off that his £40 deposit reverted
to the revenue, which is just now glad to grab at
all it can get. Yet Nat, also his comrade in mis-
fortune, Derbin Willder, can be warranted to
return at the next opportunity, with the same old
lot of broad, liberal views. Willder seems to have
a considerable pull over the other splendid failure,
inasmuch as he always comes up smiling, where-
as the smile of Nathaniel is such a gruesome affair
that he is carefully advised to keep it in the back-
ground as much as possible. Fate has denied him
the chance of ever passing into the High Court of
Parliament, on his face.

The average life of the “ fallen women
of London, dating from the day when they join
the “ unfortunate ” class to the day of their death,
is just 3| years. What they die of isn’t very well
defined, but hunger and bad liquor are responsible
for a lot of the mortality—mostly hunger. The
business doesn’t pay. Most of the subjects come
to grief morally before they are twenty, and die
of rouge and wet feet and old age and general
break-up of the system before they are 24. London
alone uses up a good many thousands of them
every year, but the supply never runs short all
the same, the trade is ruined by over-competition,
or Freetrade, or freedom of contract, or some-
thing—anyhow there is no money in it, and no
prospects, except prospects of fog and gin. A
large proportion of the unfortunates drop into the
Thames, but they are often fished out by interfer-
ing persons with hooks, and run in, and talked to
death by big, hide-bound females with bags and
tracts. A collection will now be taken up to
promote the spread of Christianity among Christ-
ians, and to convert bishops and preachers.

His temper changed once more. “Why do you
ask ? Do you want to give me up like that damneTd
jade did, and get the reward !” And then the
insane suspiciousness fled again before his need for
human sympathy, and he held out the hand which
clasped the book to the boy.
“ Here —take it ! I’ll trust you. Open and read.
Strike a light first!
The lad, unwillingly enough, obeyed. He had
never been with the old man after nightfall, and
this evening there was an unusual aspect of wild-
ness and uncanniness about him. But his
curiosity overcame his trepidation, and held him
to the spot. He lit the candle in a wall-sconce,
which was the sole light-giving appliance of the
room, and by its flickering proceeded to read the
contents of the volume.
“ Aloud !” whispered the old man. And aloud
the boy read the first page—an “ absconding
notice,” cut, as an appended note in manuscript
testified, from a Sydney Gazette. The notice
was as follows :—
Principal Superintendent of Convicts’ Office,
Sydney, May 17, ,182-.
rpiIE undermentioned Prisoners, having absented them-
selves from their respective Employments, and some
of them at large with false Certificates, all Constables and
others are hereby required to use their utmost exertions
in lodging them in safe custody.
Any person harbouring, concealing, or maintaining any
of the said absentees will be proseeuted for the oflence.
(Signed) F. A. Hely, J.P.,
Principal Superintendent.
A list of the absconders followed, some 30 or 40,
and the boy was reading it down. “ Go down to
the ‘S’s’!” interrupted the old man. And read
what you see. Third of the “S’s” the boy read
out the particulars of William Shovey.
“ Shovey—William, Henry Porcher, labourer,
19, Dublin, 5ft. 5|in., chestnut eyes, brown hair,
brown complexion, from No. 9 Iron Gang.”
' “Who’s William Shovey?” cried the terrible
old man. He beat his hairy breast with savage
irritation. “ Who’s Shovey, William ? Say, you
whelp, say ! Don’t stand there like a fool, but
answer.”
“You are!” the boy replied, startled with
sudden prescience.
“Yes, I am!—I am William Shovey, and I
don’t care who knows it now, for my time is
coming soon ! You know it now, and Johnny
Fawkner did, and you’re the only two in all Vic-
toria who know it. But I don’t care now—I’ll
advertise it in the Age to-morrow, and the Argus
that. I’m William Shovey—ha, ha !”— the misery
of that laughter !—“that would be funny, wouldn’t
it, to advertise oneself as an absconder? But,
you, go on ! See what’s on the next page !”
Then the boy read this : —

On the back of the document—it was pasted on a
guard so that the endorsement could bo read easily
—were Dillon’s particulars : —
Dillon, William, Surry (2), Labourer, 20,
Cork, 5feet Gin. , hazel eyes, brown hair, dark
complexion. Tattooed anchor on riyht forearm.
“ And who’s Dillon?” questioned the ex-convict.
“ Who’s Dillon, whelp?”
“ You are, I suppose. But I won’t stop hereto
be called whelp.” The youngster turned to go.
“Don’t go, boy! You’ll be sorry when you
know rny time’s come. I won’t call you whelp
again. But who’s Dillon ? ”
“ If you are not, I don’t know.”
“ But if I’m Dillon, of the Surry Second, how
is it I’m Shovey of the Henry Porcher?”
The boy was beginning to know the System,
and so he fired a shot which was not altogether a
random one.
“ You stole Dillon’s certificate of freedom when
you bolted!”
It was as though the old man had been trying
an experiment, the result of which was destructive
to himself. He flamed into mad violence of speech
and gesture, and denounced the boy.
“ Like all the rest, traitors and spies! You use
the knowledge you gtt from me to convict me.
Damn you ! You piece things together to put
me away ! If you can make me out to be Shovey,
free on a false certificate, others can, the police
can, the judge can !”
But the boy, angered as well as alarmed at the
man’s eccentricity, stopped to hear no more. He
passed out, and never saw Dillon, otherwise
Shovey, again.
But ten days afterwards there came to his
father’s address a manuscript, which, in feeble
scrawl, on blue paper, made the ex-convict’s
peace,

Tales of the Old Regime.
No. XIII.-The "Henry Porcher" Bolter.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Within a stone’s throw of the house, in
Church-street, Richmond, Victoria, wherein Peter
Lalor died, is a cottage which is as ancient a
building as you will find in the suburbs of
young Melbourne. Dilapidated inside, weather-
stained as to exterior, for years it has been
without tenants for longer periods than it has
enjoyed them. It would have had fewer still, had
its landlord’s agent informed intending lessees of
the eerie legend of the place.
For hero it was that one of the “bolters,”
advertised by Mr. F. A. Hely, J.P., Principal
Superintendent of Convicts, in the Sydney
Gazette, in the year 1827, was found (ne morn-
ing, in the Early Seventies, stark-stiff, dead.
* * *
How the writer came to know him need
not here be related. Suffice it that between us
there was an intimacy of a kind. He tolerated
the school-boy ; and the school-boy regarded him
with something of respect and more of fear. For
he was not a loveable character.
Two services did the ex-convict dp to the school-
boy. He introduced him to the System and the
Regime—a service which was of very questionable
value. And he made him free of a marvellous
collection of books. As to which privilege also
the writer has his doubts. If he had not had per-
mission to ramble at will through the Bolter’s
books, he might have developed into a portly and
wealthy banker, instead of a hard-up journalist.
This last remark is not altogether by the way.
Had it not been for the “Bolter ” and his books
probably these “Tales of the Regime” would
never have been written.
# # #
His books were everywhere in the house.
From the hall-entrance to the back-door, from the
basement to the attic ceiling, they were filed in
lobbies and rooms, on stair-cases and in fire-
places. They blocked window-recesses and" ob-
scured sky-and-fan lights. Narrow passages, the
breadth of a man’s frame, wormed through the
heaps of volumes, so that he could make his way
to any particular class of work desired. For he
preserved amidst apparent chaos a system of
arrangement, and though he absolutely dispensed
with the use of shelving, he could, without diffi-
culty, find a book when he wanted it.
Literally surrounded by his books, he lived the
life of a solitary. But one person was admitted to
the house—the aforesaid school-boy. Even the
carrier who brought home the parcels of his pur-
chases from Dwight, the bookseller’s, or Shibb,
the auctioneer’s, was never allowed an inch beyond
the threshold, and, however weighty the package,
or miscellaneous its contents, the old biblomaniac
would drag it in himself. Tradesmen never came
to the house, for he himself bought in the shops
and prepared his food, and the postman, when he
brought a rare letter, knew better than to knock
or ring. He would slip it under the door, and the
old man might or might not pick it up. Which-
ever he did, it was all one in the result, for the
letter was never opened. After his death a letter
from Quaritch, London, dated five years before,
was found, offering him a four-figure sum for a
unique Bible known to be in his possession. Sir
Redmond Barry bought the treasure for a song at
the sale.
His very bed supported books; the table on
which he took his spare meals Was partly covered
with them, and the seat he generally favoured in
preference to the one chair to be discovered on the
premises was a low pile of some folios bound in
the sturdy fashion past generations were wont to
entomb their Dryasdusts. He lived in his books,
and died among them.
His name was, as the boy knew it first, William
Dillon, and he told it to the school-boy in the
rainy duskiness of a December evening. The boy
had stolen in by the back-way to say good-bye
before leaving for up-country to spend his Christ-
mas holidays. And the old man, for the first
time and the last time, welcomed him with soft-
ness of voice. Usually he had but one tone, the
raucous surliness of the hater of the human.
“So you are going before my time comes, lad ?”
“Sir!” for the boy did not understand the
allusion.
“My time is soon now. Johnny Fawkner’s
gone, and I said I would not be long after him !”
“Did you know Mr. Fawkner, sir? I never
heard you speak of him before !”
“Know him? Of course! It was he who
helped me in Hobart Town after my bolt from the
gang. ”
The boy listened. The old man had told a
hundred times of the colonial System in the brave
.days of old, but in all his narratives he had sought
to convey that his knowledge was that only of
the student and the observer. That he had owned
a personal interest in the System flashed into the
boy’s mind.
“Do you not hear, you whelp ! Did you hear
me use the word gang ?”
He was lying on his bed. Between his body and
the wall were books, and books were at his feet.
As he spoke he, vexed, half-rose, and in the petu-
lance of his movement, thrust some of the volumes
to the floor, or rather upon other books.
The boy stooped to pick them up.
“ Stop !” roared the old man, with an accent as
of near thunder. “ Stop ! How dare you touch
it!”
The lad held in his hand a small book, elegantly
bound in calf, with rich toolings and deep-gilt
edges. It was the first he had picked up. Before
he could answer, the old man spoke again.
“ Give it to me, you young rascal! Isthathpw
you treat me? But why should you be different ?
You’re all alike you, men, women and chil-
dren, traitors all, spies all !” He snatched the
book and thrust it between the laps of his open
vest, and cursed the boy again.
The lad grew indignant, though his awe of the
old fellow was such as"to prevent his uttering his
feelings with the characteristic rudeness of the
“ young colonial.” All he cared to say was:
“ I’m no traitor or spy ! I. don’t know what the
book is, and I don’t want to know. I’m off now,
so good night!”
The rumble gave place to a strange pleading.
“ Don’t go, lad, don’t. I was too sharp. And
don't mind me, for my time is very close, very
close !” He paused, and a gasping sigh parted
the gathering darkness, and thrilled the lad fear-
somely.
“ My time's coming close, and there’s no one to
do justice to —to ”
“ To whom ? ” the lad ventured to ask, at last.
“ You should not have left me that night,
my boy. You should have put up with my non-
sense. For I was mad.
“ But, as you went away, don’t come back.
You offended me by going, and I never forgive an
offence.
“But I will tell you now that I am Shovey, and
that I did steal Dillon’s certificate of freedom. 1
tell you so that in 20 years’ time you can tell
others. Not under 20 years —that will see the
last of Dillon. For Dillon is still alive. Every
week a letter comes to me in care of Dwight, from
Gleadow, the solicitor, in Launceston, which tells
me whether he is alive or dead. He was alive last
week.
“All along I have meant to do him justice.
But he has life-sentence after life-sentence, and I
could not do him good. Gleadow has tried for-
me, but as I did not tell Gleadow all the truth, he
could do nothing. All I could do was to pay a
warder at Port Arthur to give him tobacco fre-
quently. I don’t know whether the warder gave
him all I paid for. But I do know that once some
of the stuff was found upon him, and he got 20
lashes.
“Yes, Dillon’s alive, and he will outlive me.
And, if he does, he will have every penny 1
possess. All will be sold, and I will leave such
papers—they are ready now—that surely the Tas-
manian Government will grant him release.
“ He shall have wealth and ease at the last. Mu

money shall give him both. It is a fair exchange
gold for his freedom.
•‘lt Was in 1819 that I first knew Dillon. We
Were in the Parramatta Road iron-gang together,
He was a softy then, did his work as well as ho
could to please the overseer, and being afraid of
the rest of us, we put upon him. But he had his
revenge.
“ When he was freed, and the very day he got
his certificate, he came down to the gang; Because
he had pleased, the overseer he let Dillon conle
near us and speak to us. Any other man would
have been arrested. But Dillon spoke to us, and
taunted us, and we could not say a word in reply,
“He held the certificate in his mawly, and he
came near to each one of us and thrust it under
our eyes. ‘There,’ he would say, ‘you ain’t got
that! You’re lags, and I’m a free man.’ And we
durst not say anything, though wo were maddened
at the thought of it.
“ Th- re were nineteen of us all told, and wo
were caged at night in the watch-house-yard,
George-street toll-bar. An open shed it was we
were in, but ’twas better far than Barracks—
there wasn’t a warder or a guard on the inside,
From look-up to rising we were left to ourselves,
And the deviltry that went on then !
“ But that night there was no deviltry ; we
Were all too keen to discuss Dillon and his dirty
trick in coining and insulting us. We were under
Government and in irons, but ’twas no reason
why we should be insulted. We had a little of
men’s feelings left, we said one to another, and we
would not stand it.
“When we got our ration, instead of beginning
the devils’row, as usual, we were quiet—so quiet
that the sentry poked in his head and said he was
sure we were a-brewing mischief-. We told him
we were all dog-tired, that was Why, and he was
satisfied.
We talked and talked what we should do to
Dillon, and at last we decided to steal his paper,
But who should steal it?—that was the question,
“ Someone said we should fight for it, we were
nine couples and a single, and the couples should
fight; each two men against another two, and
the winners should fight one another. At the
end of the first round the bye-man should be
taken into the lot, and someone else should stand
out. So for the third round and till the last.
And the victor in the last ties should fight the
bye-man, and the best man of the two should bo
helped to make a bolt of it, so that he might steal
Dillon’s certificate.
“ It was a good idea, we agreed, and a happy
way of spending Sunday. For the next day was
Sunday, and not being in barracks we were not
mustered for church; We Would be mustered at
morning ration, and that Was all. So We could
haVe the day for sparring, and the winner could
bolt at night.
“We slept quiet that night, and the sentry
told the overseer who mustered us that he was
sure there was devilment afoot, and the overseer
sent down to the Military Barracks for another
sentry. That did not trouble us.
“At nine o’clock we paired off. And at half-
past nine I had put my man down ; he was older
than I, but knew more about sparring, and our
battle was the longest.
“ At ten o’clock we drew fresh lots, and I was
fortunate enough to stand out the third round,
That was one freedom, I am sure, that resting,
The others went at it, and by this time the news
had spread, and numbers of persons, some on
their way to church, stopped to peer through the
half-opened gates some gave the sentries a dump
a-head to come inside and watch us closely.
“ In the fourth round I was drawn, but my
man was soon done up, for he had fought all
through, and then I had to fight the bye-man. It
was awful, that tussle, for he was nearly my own
age and strength. But I knew a trick
which threw him, and when his head fell
on the cobbles, it dazed him, and he
could not come up to time. Then the persons in
the yard made a subscription fot itlfi, ahd gitVe tide
tvV'd dollars and tike dumps.* But the sentries
tdOk half.
“ That night I bolted. I was helped over the
wall at the rear where there were no sentries, by
some of the gang. The others were making the
customary row, quarrelling and fighting among
themselves, so as to deceive the guards.”
* * *
Here Shovey’s manuscript broke off. He
caused it to be left at the boy’s home a day or two
before he died—by whom was not known. He
must have felt that “ his time was coming,” and
penned the narrative perhaps to facilitate the
doing of tardy justice to—his victim,
The boy thought the story was ended, when, oil
showing the papers to his elders, enquiries were
made, and it Was found that Dillon Had died at
Fort Arthur on the eVe of that Christmas which
had been Shovey’s last.
Ytars afterwards, however, he heard from one
who knew.both men, the sequel of the escape.
‘ Shovey did not tell you the whole of the cir-
eumstances preliminary to his bolt. He omitted
one most material particular,
“ That was that he was to return and show the
others of the gang the stolen certificate.”
“ What good could thatdothem?”
“None, But it Would prove to them that
Shovey had carried out the agreement on which
alone they had helped him to escape; for which
they received punishment. They were, every man
Jack of them, flogged for not informing the
guard. Well, Shovey did not return, and as their
notion had been less to free Shovey than to punish
Dillon, they felt betrayed, and vowed the convict
oath to revenge themselves upon him. And,
somehow or other, in that mysterious way in
which intelligence spread in the old days, among
the whole penal population, Shovey learnt of their
resolve.”
“ But how did he steal the certificate ? ”
“There was at that time in Sussex-street,
Sydney, an inn, notorious for being the resort of
absconders. Why the watch left it undisturbed
for so many years would be a puzzle, if it were
not known that they were always bribable. To
this place, Shovey went, and being a likely fellow
—that is, likely to pay if not recaptured—Whs
aided in his design to escape,to Vati Diemert’s
Land. He would have’ gone without attempting
to steal the certificate from Dillon, but the landlord
of the ‘ public ’—influenced by the Freemasonry
of scoundrelism—swore that if he did not commit
the theft, he would not only not assist him to
leave the colony, but would hand him over to the
police.
“ Well, he stole the certificate. A girl was
kept at the public-house to act as a decoy-duck,
and, by her wiles, Dillon was drawn to the place,
Necessarily he had his certificate with him ; and
it was the easiest mode to hocus the man, and rob
him of his ‘papers.’ You see, Dillon was not
likely ; he intended, if he could, to remain ‘square,’
and the publican, who was also a ‘ fence,’ hoped to
make a decent profit from Shovey.
“ Shovey got off with the certificate to Hobart
Town. There’, a few pricks with the needle and a
little gunpowder made him tally with Dillon’s
description. Young Johnny Fawkner, believing
lum to be Dillon helped him to work.
He did well for a year or two. Then, one
d^’r. t -n ere^ n u dup k fche wom . an - . ,
Dillon had been flung out into the street after
the theft, hocussed, drunk; At a Word ftottl the
publican, the Watch obligingly removed him to
the cells, and next day (as a newly-freed prisoner
unworthy of freedom because ho had lost his
papers)—these were but Alexander Berry’s words
—he was awarded 12 months’ gang-work. What
wonder he was desperate? What wonder he now
committed crimes? Before, the 12 months were
expired he was under sentence for life.
“Then, the woman relented, she knew that
others of No. 9 Gang had brooded over Shovey’s
treachery themselves, as they regarded it, and
were eager to avenge it. They thought nothing
of the wrong to Dillon ; what they resented was
the fancied wrong to themselves. The girl,
repentant of her share for Dillon’s fate, wanted to
do Dillon justice. The gangers wanted to pumsh
Shovey.
In some way ot other a feW of the gangers
commanded money, and Sent the girl OVer to
Van Diemen s Land.
“ And there, one dav in Campbell-street, she
accused Shovey of being at large on a false certi-
ficate. She would not leave him till she procured
his arrest then and there.
* * *
“He was brought upon suspicion of being
an absconder.
“He was stripped to his waist in court—the
woman was present—and his ‘marks’ compared
with the certificate. ‘ They tallied fairly,’ the
magistrate said.
“ Then the measuring-rod was brought, and his
height was taken. ‘lt was near enough,’ the
magistrate considered.
“ The woman asked the Bench to order a search-
ing of the Sydney Gazette. ‘The file was
defective,’pronounced the magistrate.
“‘What can I do to prove, your Worship, this
man is William Shovey, bolter—not William
Dillon, free by servitude? I’ll stake my life it is
him !’ cried the woman.
“ The Bench misunderstood—possibly.
“ ‘ » you take your life, I may consider
yJ " r m h tatement I t )ro y ed 1 • sai .d fhe Bench.
Ihe woman looked stupidly round the court-
room/ By ill-luck, an officer of the garrison was
one of the visitors, and, being privileged, he had
seated himself within the rails* For comfort’s
sake, lie had unhooked his swofrd alld had placed
it on the table ill front of him.
“ fn a second, the girl had rushed forward, had
withdrawn the glittering blade, and before one
individual of the startled, horrified court could
lift a finger to stop the action, had slashed her
throat.
“As the blood gurgled from the gash, she
gasped an echo of his words: ‘ You—believe —
now !’ ”

step in the right direction has been taken by the
Universal Land and Deposit Bank, Limited, who,
in a little pamphlet entitled “Mutual Banking,”
have called attention to a few points of practical

(the depositors) obtain a first lien over all the
assets of the concern and are in possession of a
collateral security equal to the sum deposited,
which, by the way, bears interest. The scheme
is entirely novel, and we think the originators
deserve the support of the public in their efforts
to improve the position of the depositor. We
commend the above-mentioned pamphlet to the
attention of our readers who contemplate invest-
ing their money in this manner. It is forwarded

feebled by disease, age, or neglect, this dressing
imparts renewed life to the scalp, so that the
hair again assumes its original
Fullness and Beauty.
Ladies find that this preparation imparts to the
hair a silken pliancy and a delicate and lasting
fragrance. Gentlemen use it to prevent bald-
ness, to restore faded and gray hair to its former
color and abundance, and to relieve the scalp of
troublesome humors and dandruff. A proof of
the superiority of this preparation over all
others of the kind is the constantly-increasing
demand for it in all civilized countries.

Twenty Years in the study and practice of
QHRONIC, NERVOUS,
AND
Special Diseases
Of Men and Women in the leading Medical Schools and
Hospitals of Great Britain, Paris, Berlin and Vienna, and
in private practice. Formerly House Surgeon to the
Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, Maternity and Lock Hospitals.
No medical man advertising in these colonies has medical
degrees which can be compared with his. Such eminent
qualifications, together with his recognised straightfor-
ward treatment, has naturally gained for him the reputa-
tion of being the
ONLY LEGALLY QUALIFIED DOCTOR
advertising in these colonies who combines with special
Knowledge Honest Treatment, as may easily be ascer-
tained by applying to any leading paper in the colony.
No diseases cause so much misery and distress as those
included in my speciality.
All Men Young and Old,
Sufferh g from the results of early follies or ex-
cesses, indigestion, foul mouth, costiveness, palpi-
tation, singing and pains in the ears and head,
specks before the eyes, giddiness, weakened
memory, pains in the back and chest, varicocele,
diseases of the bladder, kidneys, or liver, rheuma-
tism, impure blood, weakeningdischarges, impaired
vigor,sterility,premature decay, stricture, nervous-
ness, groundless fears, bashfulness, lassitude, and
NERVOUS DEBILITY, should lose no time in
consulting him, since he has, by long experience
and thorough investigation of their nature, dis-
covered the safest treatment for their permanent
cure. Persons residing at a distance may be treated
at their own homes, without any interruption to
their business, by giving a full and clear descrip-
tion of their symptoms, and the necessary medi-
cines will be forwarded to them. On receipt of

Dr. Alex. Paterson,
£Ol Macquarie Street North (opposite Parliament House)
Betting as a Veterinary Art.
Ouk mare was Cissy. I tliink Cassandra was her
real name, but from Gassy it oame to Cissy and
sometimes Cis. You can get odds against a Cissy,
but if you enter Cassandra some idiots fancy the
prad to be a goer. But then we had won so many
little tenners and ponies that, even with nine
stone up, we never could get a decent bet after the
first fiver. I say WE, but I had no share, although
a great interest, in the mare. She belonged to my
only friends, friends who would lay me on and
stall me off at the will and the won't : and I make
my home with these simple people who know all
that is worth knowing about a horse.
Well, one Christmas there were races at the
Five Corners, not very small races either, but
good lumps (for the bush) of added money. Cissy
was in fine nick and the Trial Stakes was a fight
for her, but the added money was only £lO.
About a week before the races I got old Brickson
and his wife to listen to a proposal of mine. It
was this : —“ Now, Bob, attend to me. You can
make money if you follow my tip, and I do not
think it a swindle. It is a case of dog bite dog.
You run her in the Trial Stakes and win. That’s
a tenner. Scratch her for the big race and let her
go for the Shorts. I’H guarantee that you get
twenty to one against her, and you need only take
the ten pounds’ worth to win two centuries.”
Both Bob and Mrs. Brickson were afraid of
some cross work, but they knew me well, and I
refused to give them any information as to how I
would put Cissy back in the betting in a race for
which she would probably start at odds on. But at
last they said : “ Well, we’ll get that ten pounds,
and if I hear ten or five to one offered about her
for the Shorts, I’m there.” Then we said good
night, and dreamed of new clothing and an addi-
tional loose-box.
Christmas, eighteen hundred and somethingty-
somth. We don’t fly off to town. We go fishing
with the kids in the morning, after galloping
Cissy and Lucy and Fantan. In the evening we
sleep under the trees till it’s time to give the nags
a tub down and an hour’s walk. No headaches or
heartaches for us on Boxing Day, but a ride to the
Five Corners leading Cissy. We turned the other
two out in the garden. They were not wanted till
St. Patrick’s Day.
Cut it short, old man !
I must tell you we killed a sheep on Christmas
eve. Mind that.
Of course we won the Trial ; and, of course,
Brickson and his missus were annoyed at seeing
the big money taken by a duffer like M‘Guinn’s
Bluelight. Then oame a hullabaloo in the ring.
Cissy’s price? Even money. No more?
You’ll soon have to lay odds. But what
is this? A publican who had been look-
ing at Cissy suddenly shouts out, “I lay
ten to one Cissy.” Brickson and his wife are
at the scales weighing Tommy, our Tommy, who
is to ride. The lady snaps the offer, calls a
witness, and books it.' Then two bookies run
over to where I am holding the mare, at whose
forefeet is a pool of blood, and more dropping from
her nostrils. Back they go ! Twenty to one
Cissy ! Brickson cops to the tune of a tenner, and
comes to me to see what it all means. “Lord!
we’re done,” he said. Then I kicked his anile
sideways. “ All right, Bob ; that sheep bled well
the night before last.” But there was no more
betting and in ten minutes Herr Adalbert Hash,
the secretary, was proclaiming Cissy the winner
of the Shorts’ Open Sweepstakes.
One hotelkeeper and one bookmaker were heard
to say, “ a damned swindle.’’ Was it?

Flaubert’s particular friend was Brouilhet,
dramatist, living with a woman by whom he had
a son. When he was dying, he wanted to marry
her, but she refused, in order to inspire him with
hope that he would live on.
Says Sydney Echo: “N.S.W. Sydney
Bank depositors have a million and a quarter
sterling to them credit. But for strikes how much
more would it be?” Probably a million less.
But for past strikes the workman of to-day would
have absolutely nothing to save.
Alleged murderer Thomas, of Deniliquin
(N.S.W.) Gaol, had his little joke the other day.
He climbed to the top of a tank, 30ft. high, in the
gaol-yard, and peeped over the wall. A crowd
congregated, and Thomas proceeded to deliver am
oration suitable to the occasion. When asked to
come down, he said he thought he preferred
suicide in the tank. Archdeacon Holt, a gaol
visitor, crawled tremblingly up the ladder, bub
prisoner Thomas threatened to fall down and
break the parson’s neck. So the parson weakened.
Fresh ladders had to be got and placed so that a
warder was able to get on top of the tank and
above the crank, who was then standing on the
top ladder-rung, narrating how he had murdered
the only woman he ever loved and felt glad about
it. He had to be urged down the ladder by
having water “ cataraoted ” on him.

WHAT CURES PIMPLES
The only really successful prevent-
ive and cure of pimples, blotches,
blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin,
| and most complexional disfigurations,
is that greatest of all Skin Purifiers
and Beautifiers, the celebrated Cuti-
cura Soap. For irritating and scaly
humors of the scalp, with dry or fall-
ing hair, red, rough hands, chaps,
painful finger ends with shapeless
nails, and simple humors of the skin
and scalp of infancy and childhood, it
is simply infallible.
CUTICURA SOAP
A marvellous beautifier of world-wide celebrity, CUTICURA Soap is simply incom-
parable as a Skin-Purifying Soap, unequalled for the Toilet, and without a rival for
the Nursery. Absolutely pure, delicately medicated, exquisitely perfumed; it produces
the whitest, clearest skin, and softest hands, and prevents inflammation and clogging
of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches, blackheads, red and oily skin, and most
complexional disfigurations. It derives its remarkable medicinal properties from
Cuticura, the great skin cure, but so delicately are they blended with the purest of
toilet and nursery soap stocks that the result is a medicated toilet soap incomparably
superior to all other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and sur-
passing in purity the most noted and expensive of toilet and nursery soaps. For the
prevention of facial blemishes, for giving a brilliancy and freshness to the com-
plexion, and for cleansing the scalp and invigorating the hair, it is without a peer.
Sale greater than the combined sales of all other skin soaps. Sold everywhere. 25c.
with Itching and Burning Eczemas, and other Itching,
scaly, and blotchy skin and scalp diseases, are relieved
by a single application, and speedily, permanently, and
economically cured by CutiCUl*a. ReiTlGdieS, the greatest Skin Cures, Blood Purifiers, and
Humor Remedies of modern times. Price: Cuticura, the great Skin Cure, 50 cents; Cuticura

Flo. Bilton is billed at a London music-hall as “sister
to the Countess Clancarty.” Which reminds us that
Carlotta Patti once refused to sing in Manchester because
placarded as sister to Adelina.
Melba, according to London papers not up to her form
of two years ago, has been offered by Sir Gussy Harris,
£250 a night to sing at Covent Garden. She is re-engaged
for Paris Grand Opera and for Brussels in Sept.
Menie Muriel Dowie, the author of “ An English Girl in
Carpathians,” intends visiting Australia next year.
H. M. Stanley's accident is said to be the very latest
cheap ad. of R, S. Smythe. Archibald Forbes sprained
his ankle when he went to dine at Government
House, Sydney, and had to lecture sitting in a chair.
Wybert Reeve’s Reminiscences are out, in book-form,
Australian published. Very good they are, too, mostly
collocated from his papers in various journals. Once we
found a little blue-book about the Stratford Shakespeare
Centenary, 1861, in Melbourne Public Library, “Pre-
sented by William Creswick,” and it puzzled us what was
the little axe to grind till we found that the star was
“Mr. William Creswick, from London.” A trifle of this,
you know', in the “ Only Fosco,” but Wybert is an honour
to the profession.
Ibsen does not believe in patriotism. It is to him, a
thorough cosmopolitan, merely a racial superstition.
Ibsen, by the way, is more closely related to the Scotch
Covenanters than the Vikings.
David Christie Murray’s play, “Chums,” will be staged
at London Globe on August 27. David plays the lead.
Edmund Leathes, a stage lover who suffered from a
rather “nut-crackers” arrangement of nose and chin,
died the other day. He was the son of Doctor Donaldson
(a learned, bat forgotten person), and may be remem-
bered by many Australians as the Laertes in the first
Lyceum production of “Hamlet.” It was Leathes, too,
who tried to “ Led Astray ” the gigantic Helen Barry,
when Boucicault’s drama was played at the London
Gaiety.
“ Peril ” was first produced in London by the Bancrofts,
not -as a Melbourne paper muddles it—by the Kendals.
Moreover, the Kendals never ran the Prince of Wales.
Theatrical reminiscences need to be backed up by a good
memory.
A theatrical agent ran away from his English home
18 years ago. He hears now that he has been entitled to
£4OOO a year for several years past. It’s like a der-ream
or a pel-lay.
Chas. Warner’s “Drink,” at Drury, takes very well,
but critics think he has made the last act too revoltingly
real, and over the line of that artistic taste which
Franoisque Sarcey praised, when he said Warner was
better than Gil Nara, of the original company in Paris.
The late Henry Edwards acted in five now extinct Melb.
theatres: Queen’s, Olympic, Old Royal, Haymarket, Old
Princess’, and he made two balloon ascents from Sydney,
returning once only just in time to act Eugene de Lorme,
in “ Love’s Sacrifice,” to Brooke’s Matthew Elmore, at the
Victoria.
Parkinson, a Goshenite member of the London County
Council, was prosecuted last June for libel, on a perform-
ance by Japanese automata, at the Aquarium. He said a
female automaton was indecent, searching for a butterfly-
in its clothes, and the automata were fetched into Court,
like the Tommy and Sally of our ventriloquists. Said
Judge Hawkins: “Perhaps we might find a place for the
lady on the bench,” a subtle-caustic hit at Lady Cole-
ridge.
Pall Mall Bijdoht seems to have been hoaxed by
Toole's composite Maori bath-photograph. But as the
shadows were thrown in antagonistic directions, the fake
got exposed.
Nugent Robertson, of Sydney, says Sara Bernhardt is

Athenseum Club fire.
Kowalski is about to travel for his health, and the

According to an American paper one of the “ Evan-
geline ” girls was so anxious to come to Australia that she
‘ popped ” her diamonds to raise the passage-money. The
fame of “ Joe” MacMahon s moustache has wrecked many
a happy home, but he can’t help that.

Dear Bulletin',—ln the middle of last winter I started
one Saturday morning to go to the Victoria Market, Mel-
bourne, by the first train, which leaves Essendon at 5.20
a.m. I reached Moonee Ponds station ere the train had
gone down to Essendon, and was standing on the up plat-
form when it came from Melbourne. It was pitch-dark
and there was no moon. The only light was from one or
two feeble gas-lamps on the platform. As the train
stopped I was exactly opposite a first-class carriage, which
was lighted up. It was one of the old stuffy sort, uphol-
stered m blue cloth and with blue curtains to the win-
uows. Only one compartment was occupied, and that
one by a man and a woman. They had carefully drawn

Information,
Mr. J. T. Annear, M.L.A.
SENIOR MEMBER FOR MARYBOROUGH, (Q.)
Mb. J. T. Anneab, M.L. A., senior member for
Maryborough (Q.), was born at Budock Penryn,
Cornwall, England, on June 3, 1842, and was
educated at the Church of England Denomi-
national School, Budock. He arrived in Queens-
land in 1863, and settled in Ipswich where he
carried on contracting until 1867 when he went to
Maryborough where he was successful in obtain-
ing contracts for many important buildings,
including the new public offices and the State-
school. He was a member of the firm of J. T.
Annear and Co., railway contractors, who carried
out the Maryborough and Gympie x-ailway. Mr.
Annear was an alderman of Maryborough for 14
years, and was elected Mayor of the town for one
year He was first elected in 1883 to the House
of Assembly, and in 1887 he was elected the
second time to the House of Parliament as senior
member for Maryborough. In 1889 Mr. Annear paid
a visit to England and America, accompanied by
two well-known Australians, one a Minister for
Justice in a late N.S.W. Government. Mr.
Annear visited Washington, and had interviews
with President Harrison and Mr. Blaine, princi-
pally on legislative topics as affecting Australia
and the United States. On Mr. Annear’s arrival
in England he was heartily welcomed by many of
his old friends and relatives, including his parents,
who are still hale and hearty. On returning to
Queensland, he re-occnpied his seat in the House
of Assembly on the 18th September, 1889, and
then sat on the Opposition benches in support of
Sir Samuel Griffith’s policy. Shortly after
returning to his adopted land he visited his
constituents at Maryborough and received a
hearty and enthusiastic reception. He is senior
member of the firm of Cowly and Annear, Bris-
bane, who deal largely in cement and contractors’
supplies, which they import direct from Great
Britain and America. When the Morehead
Government went out of office and was replaced by
the Coalition Party, Mr. Annear was unanimously
elected Ministerial whip. In this capacity he
has proved a most pronounced success.
Jf the French fleet participates in a naval

Should Alfred of Edinburgh loom large in the
navigation we will hope for the worst. He can be

A M.L. Labour-member before his election
used to wear a blue blouse and an ancient billy-
cock, but on his return a committee was formed to
provide him with another suit. Next day, he
pranced around in a black frock-coat and a stove-
pipe hat, whereupon the chairman of his
committee: —“Say, old man, we gave you those
swell togs to wear in Wellington; your old blue
blouse is good enough for us.” So the duds were
laid up in lavender until the legislator got to the
seat of Government.
Victorian Treasurer Gillies’ system of
what he called “ recoups,” is fast driving his suc-
cessor mad. Gillies’ finance was pecxxliar, and
ought to have been put in a museum. He used to
provide in his estimates for a sum of £20,000 to be
advanced out of the consolidated revenue to build
something or another, £17,500 to be afterwards
recouped out of the sale of something else, and
£6500 to be recouped from some other source, leav-
ing a credit of £4OOO, which would be advanced
along with £6OOO more—to be afterwards partly
recouped by disposing of a gaol somewhere—to
provide export-bonuses on butter or something.
The amount of the butter bonuses which weren’t
recouped out of the sale of the disused gaol, would
be recovered from the Stamp Department, and
anything that was recovered from the Stamp
Department, over and above the butter bonuses,
would be advanced as an addition to the charitable
vote, until it could be squared by the recovery of
an outstanding balance from the Mines Office.
Gillies seemed to keep most of the public cash in
small sums made up in brown paper, and to pre-
serve his accounts on the backs of old letters and
envelopes. When 2s. 2d. was wanted for pur-
poses of secondary education he had to grope
about his office till he found the identical ss. 9£d.
that had been paid in as fines for selling bad
flounders, because that particular 2s. 2d. was to
go towards making up 7s. 3d. for an office ruler,
and as these sums had all been “earmarked ” he
had to use them and no others. If he couldn’t
find them he would pay somebody 10s. fid. to help
him hunt for them, and “recoup ” that with one-
third of another amount received from the Lands
Department, and two-fifths of something else
which would also be carefully laid aside for the
purpose. He was a dreadfully conscientious old
Scotchman about the cash, but somehow he wasn’t
a success all the same.

It was when the flood was about that a
Melbourne journal made this warning remark—
“ Though the forenoon has been free of rain we
need not hollow before we are out of the wood.”
Now, only a woodpecker or a worm would be
guilty of hollowing in the wood.
Madame Bodichon, who died in England a
few weeks ago, was a remarkable English lady.
At her instance vast miasmatic tracts of Algeria
were planted with eucalyptus, Australian blue
gum, which made them healthy. She was

Frenchman. Madame also figured as a first-class
water-colour artist, but was more eminent as a
founder of Girton College, and as the author of
the English legislation on married women’s
property.

His executors sub-edited it; —“Here lies the
pod; the Pease are in Heaven.” Let us rhyme it
up again :
The pod is here beneath the sod,
The Pease are shelled and gone to God.

“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at Sydney, N.S.W.)
The llulque Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper,
“The Bulletin,”
Premier A ustralian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Kepublican Form of Government.
Payment of Members.
One Person, one Vote.
State Revenue derived directly from the Land.
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
The Bulletin denounces —-
Rel igious Interference in Polities.
Foreign Titles.
The Chinese.
Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin's inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress : it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over wfliom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official— that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

SWORN CERTIFICATE. —One of Thousands more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888.
To H. P. Kuoelmann, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but I became worse every day, wasting array until
I became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints, of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as. ever.
P. KEENAN.
Declared and subscribed before me, one of Her Majesty’s
Justices of the Peace, for the Southern Bailiwick, in the
County of Grant, this 10th day of December, 1888.
