Gallipoll
The majority of the 41 competitors for the
best poem in blank verse or vers libre upon
the subject, “Gallipoli,” chose blank verse—
or what they thought was blank verse. The
vers librettists were few but fit. Many com-
petitors, among them L. J. Villiers, labored
under the delusion that blank verse called
for a stilted diction, a pretentiousness of
phrase, and an unlimited use of large Latin
or antique words. Aiming at sonorousness
they usually achieved gloom. Others erred
technically, for though blank verse allows,
nay, requires, a certain freedom from the
deadening machine-gun fire of metre, the liber-
ties taken were often insults. Yet many
bards put excellent poetry into execrable
blank verse. They would have done better
had they chosen fhe freer form of vers libre.
But vers libre, because it apparently has no
rules, is much more difficult than blank verse
to write.
Good poems were contributed by R. G.
Henderson, Morgan McD. Fay, “Austin
Biff,” F.V.8., “./Eneas Hayseed,” Maurice
Gudrin, “Waldra” John H. C. Sleeman,

Follow some brief quotations from poems
(paid fori that failed to keep to the level
of these extracts!—
Not to the sound of cymbals nor of drums,
Not by the prayers of solemn cardinals
Did our Australians achieve the best
Fcr with a reckless rushing blend of Hell, .
And hate and curses on the blanky foe
That made the blasted mess, and drinks all round
If they got back again, the heights were scaled.
“MITCHELL.”
In cloaks of purple glory, stride: for stride,
O fallen heroes! shall ye walk with those
Who stayed the chosen Persian pride at Pass
Thermopylae; who faced the -alien liQst
’Midst Alexander’s phalanxes:: with those
Who followed Caesar unto Gaul and Spain,
Ahd those whose glory lies at Agincourt:
With those who fell on Blenheim’s village fields;
And' those who scaled the Heights of Abraham.
And those who died at Wellesley’s Waterloo v
A hundred years ago 6hall march with you,
My sons, in honored company. Homage j
The Balaclava men to you shall pay 1
And those who died ’neath Afric’s scorching sun
Shall whisper “Welcome, brothers, j f ou are brave t”....
And so among the scrolls of History
Which shall endure as long as earth endures,
The fumbling withered hand of Time at work’
Unveils at length the name—“GALLIPOLI.”
A. W. VERNON KING.
Not earth of their own South laid o’er them,
Not silvery green and pungent gum leaves
Fall on their resting place afar; nor
Sound of Southern Ocean’s surge to lull them,
Where flames no blaze of Southern Cross to light
The sky, sleep they un-quiet... .listening
For that day when, war’s rude clamor ceased,
Australian feet shall tread and voices sound
When in the mould above their heads, where they
Fell facing their unbeaten foe, we plant
Our wattle trees and eucalypt, and see
Them grow to spread the bushland scents they knew
With sound of swaying boughs and rustling bark,
While wattle blossom’s gold drifts toward the sea,
Embracing shores Australian blood baptized....
Bo link’d again'by these to their home-land
Then will our sons, our deathless brave—sleep sound.
MABEL B. PATON.
Happily, “Bellerive” did not fail us:—
From the steep and shadowed heights,
Like a fierce volcano Hell,
upon our landing men—
Thundered the shrapnel shell,
The hidden turkish gun’s—
Aa appalling carnage spread,
The waters ran with blood
From the wounded and the dead,
Fresh troops refilled the gaps,
And weltering vengeance poured,
For the souls of the slaughtered ones,
Lamented and deplored.
They stormed the turkish heights.
And their cheers did rend the air.
When downward corpse’s rolled
From the treacherous foemen’s lair.
And H. Stewart gives us a Turkish view-
point :• — •
They come I They come!
Out of the Night they come!
Many Great Ships,
Like Huge Sea Monsters,
Their Lights turn Night into Day,
Their Guns shake the Very Heavens.
The Ships Vomit Forth Boats and Men. Boats and
Men,
The Bullets fall round Them like Hail in a Summer
Storm....
Still Thev Come!
They spring into the Water.
They Land! They Landl
Doubtless it is the Will of Allah that We should
take many Prisoners this Day....
By the Beard of the Prophet,
That last Shell passed close,
I felt its Breath upon My Cheek,
I taw the open Gates of Paradise,
With the Dark-eyed Houries waiting to welcome Me.
Thanks be to Allah that I did Dig.
How those Australian Dogs climb.
Will nothing stop Them?
How they Run,
Their Bayonets flashing in the Sun....
I Run. I Run.
It is net the will of Allah that I should win to
Paradise this Day
He good did I think could come to & True Believer
Fighting with these German Pigs—May Dogs defile
their Graves.
KISMET 1
Four poems are left for choice. Edward
C. Perugini’s is a fine poem, but a poem of
peace. -He sorrows for Gallipoli, because
of the havoc war has made of this faun- and
dryad-haunted land. That point of view
can never be Australia’s. Our troubles about
the blanky fauns!
She eares not for the muse* of the tear
Or that the Youngest Nation gains its fame
Upon Her hi 11 5....
The limpid loveliness of green-clothed heights
And sapphire skies
Is turned to terror by the greasy smoke
Of funeral pyres ....
M. Scott SlnnV’s poem is unhappily marred
by technical flaws. Lines like these:—
On the trenches. “Now then — Australians —
Oet a move on—now !” A long, wild coo-ee. ...
cannot be made to scan as English blank
verse. A portion may be quoted :
Death stood aghast; he scorned them with his
breath,
But they pressed onward laughing in his face:
He tore them tooth and nail, and they but paused
To wipe the blood from out their blinded eyes.
“Come on Australians! ” so the foremost called,
And lusty voices coo-eed a reply:
“You bet we’re coming 1”
Out of the darkness now and then a voice:
“Say, got a light ? The blighter’s copped me fair.
Just prop me up a bit so I can hold
My gun straight—Thanks—Good luck.”
Sudden, Day leaped
Astride the heavens, shattered from his sleep
By the fierce din and tumult. He looked down
Upon strange sights. On bloodied, lynx-eyed men
Eager and ready for another charge;
On faces that gleamed whitely, with cold lips
Moulded by courage to a reckless scorn;
On those who never more would lead the race
Of life, but needs limp after for the sake
Of the Adventure; and on other men
Of ceaseless hurry and deft hands, that worked,
Outpacing Death by inches, And he saw
Hurrying boats that plied ’twixt shore and ships c
Laden with stricken forms, whose death-dimmed eyes'
Turned to the heights with longing, where their mates
Stood forth as victors, whose faint voices cheered,
Or struggled through the silence closing in
With, “God, but we ’ave given ’em wot fori”
Fate set the stageh and rang the curtain up,
The orchestra was tuned, the Prologue said,
We waited for the Players—and they came.
Came with their reckless eyes, ap.nd shoulders squared
Bearing their honor lightly—with a laugh
Jesting their parts. From every corner rang
The worldwide furore of applause. They stood
Not boldly nor mock-modest, at salute.
Then, with a boy’s heart, coo-eed out their pride
To waiting dear ones they had loved and left.
The only difficulty in the final choice is
that of comparing a poem in blank verse with
a poem in vers libre. The prize is awarded
to Bartlett Adamson, Box 1526, G.P.0.,
Wellington, M.L., with “Pontius Potter” a
close second. Both poems are well worth
print; but that of “Pontius Potter” is held
over till a later issue.
Dig. Dig. Dig.
While a German Pig looks on....
I came not to dig, but to Fight:
For it is promised that all who (all
In the Defence of the True Faith,
Shall win straight to Paradise.
It is not meet that a True Believer
Should live like a Rat in a hole....
GALLIPOLI.
Gallipoli ! Gallipoli! A name —
A name? A people’s coronet! A signed
And sealed certificate of nationhood!
A magic symbol! A mighty symphony!
A madcap merry jest, and a divine
Impudence, and a new star in the sky!
A deed to wake the corpse of every old
Bold filibuster, and a deed to wake
An eager lovelight in a maiden’s eyes.
A flower of flowers! A rich and crimson
rose
Found in a field afar and set among
The lilies of our land. A' ruby rare,
Torn from the sword-hilt of a legended
Sultan, and sent across the leagues of sea
To grace the gracious forehead of a fair
Land that is queen among the lands of earth.
A namet A name the gods have written
down
i For immortality. A sesame
To all the prison-chambers of those hearts
Wherein great hero-thoughts and hero-deeds
Had long lain languishing.
Gallipoli!
A morning melody of early spring,
Dancing a-down the sky on light, fleet feet
And wakening all the village of our souls
To greet the rising sun: to see and greet
The new young nation striding into day.
A spring-song! And a song of grief as well:
For many a modern cavalier, who went
Gaily along where duty led, and trod
The pains that pave the path to victory,
Came not to victory, but to the old
Mysterious and enchanted garden o’ death.
A song of grief: but ever amid the woe
Thrills a siveet, clear, triumphant murmur,
telling
That Death may be an aureole to Life,
And Life become immortalised by Death.
Gallipoli! A word! A word that tells
Of men: of merry, lean, long warriors, who
Smiled in the eyes of the impossible,
And gave old Death a dig i’ the ribs, and
strode
Laughingly past him, and so won from him
The captive maid—the lithe, delightful, sweet
Victory eager for a wooer bold:
Tells of the men who made a jest of fate,
And, doing a deed that set the gods attent,
And made heroic musio to the stars,
Thought it a good day’s xvork well done, and
thought
No more of it.
Gallipoli! A tale
Magnificent that now the leisured gods
Tell and repeat to those old heroes all,
Who trod the world when all the woi'ld was
young:
And hearkening to it, how the glances leap
Keen from their martial eyes, as enviously
Those olden heroes say: “We lived and died
Too soon, too soon."
Gallipoli! The name
Bings in the sunny Australasian skies,
A nd echoes in the skies of all the world,
And through the skies of all the years to be
Will echo clear and clear for evermore,
A music too magnificent to die.

Gallipoli bill, Author
The war has already made a number of
literary discoveries. The letters from
Gallipoli Bill —most of him is called Bill-
are a revelation in the art of graphic
description. When Bill enlisted he had no
ideas of himself as an author: he did not
volunteer in search of literary fame. All
the writing he had hitherto done was an
occasionally brief note to his mate or his
girl—and he would much rather be having
a drink with Jim or a night out with Liz
than writing to them. But out there Bill
has been killed at his side and Liz is far
away. So Gallipoli Bill lays aside the rifle
for a pencil—and reveals himself as an
author. He is not proud of his letter ; he
merely puts down the things that he has
seen —but how brilliantly he puts them
down! Writing is not his game ;he knows
that there are blokes who came to Gallipoli
merely to write about it —paid blanky good
wages for it, too. But, of course, that’s
their job: his is to handle a rifle. They
must have learnt how to write; they know
all the rules; smart blokes they must be;
and no doubt they earn their pay. Take
risks, too, looking for something to write
about. Writing, not fighting. Bill prefers
the fighting; but, as the blokes at home
want to know all about it, lend us that
pencil, Alf. Here goes !
And so Gallipoli Bill writes his letter
home —and hasn’t the remotest suspicion
that he is writing literature, that his picture
of the war is far finer than that of any
official war-correspondent, that he is a bet-
ter man for this job than Ashmead Bartlett.
Gallipoli Bill is the only genuine “Eye-
witness.” And if you told Bill that he was
an author in the class of Stephen Crane, he
would merely think you were kidding. A
versatile man, and a modest, is Australian
Bill.
Here is one letter, written by a Gallipoli
Bill named A. K. Macpberson, of the First
Brigade (quoted from Sydney Sfn), that is
literature. In the simplest words and
always with the apt epithet, A. K. Mac-
pherson brings before us the bitter actuali-
ties and the acrid humors of war with a
literary artistry that many a war correspon-
dent will envy. And this is but one of a
battalion of Gallipoli Bills who, under
shrapnel, are making Australian literature:
.... On the other side of the Narrows is the ancient
and historical plain of Troy, in Asia Minor. There
were 200 cities on this plain once. Now there are
a few miserable mud huts. I wonder what Homer
would think of modern Turkish industry....
After the first landing it was then that the
Queenslanders decided on brave work. Almost on
their own initiative, for most of' the officers had
been 6hot, the men fixed bayonets, and with a wild
cheer charged up the hill. Wounded soldiers have
since told me of a gigantic Scotchman, 6ft. 6in. in
height and as strong as an ox, who in that mad
race was a couple of yards in front of everyone
else. His red hair was sticking up like an angry
cat’s. He hurled himself into a trench, and in a
second his bayonet was dripping blood. With
squeals of fear the Turks broke and fled, only to fall
from the bayonets of others....
It is marvellous how quickly one grows to under-
stand shrapnel. You would see the flame and smoke,
and instantly wonder where the projectile would hit.
If it whistles like a cricket with a bad cold it will
pass harmlessly overhead. If it sounds like far-
distant cheering, such as “Hooray-ay-ay,” duck for
cover, as your chances of Kingdom Come are good.
Bluejackets were with us in the boats. One was
steering, and he exhorted us to “Pull like Hell,
chummies, or you’ll be like those on the
beach.” The he was referring to had done
with warfare and everything else of this earth. The
sailors seemed to be absolutely recklees of all
danger.
Out on the left flank, occasionally, a venturesome
lurk would creep out endeavoring to find out the
effect of their fire. I don’t think any of them
returned. One coolly crept along his ridge for
about 20ft., craning his neck for a sign of our
whereabouts We were all firing at him, but he
dropped behind cover unscathed. “He’s a game
——, I heard one remark appreciatively. The
link was probably a fatalist, and believed his time
had not yet come. Up he popped again—just for a
second, but it was long enough. About a hundred
nfles cracked. The Turk leaped into the air, spun
iOund like a top, and fell in a heap,
r 4r° ut , 2 \ 80 in the afternoon I got my first wound
I had had several miraculous escapes previously.
My coat had been shot through several times, and
portion of a shell had smashed my water-bottle
Thu particular bullet went through my rifle at
what is called the point of balance, through the
middle finger of the left hand, and tore a piece off
the fourth finger Continuing its course it went
into the breast of a man lying alongside of me.
The uch arterial blood spurted out in a stream
betore him, but lie gave me a cheery grin, and said,
Well, matey, I wont worry about your noisy rifle
any more.” He died within three minutes. ,Tust
previously he had been growling about my rifle the
barrel of which was red hot, and made a row like a
bomb.
I bound up my fingers and took the dead man’s
rifle. The dead were fairly thick by this time, and
I don t think any of us expected to come out alive
There was not the slightest sign of fear manifested
anywhere, and narrow shaves were jested at. A
fellow alongside of me was cautiously smoking a
cigarette. I rummaged a bumper out of my clothes,
and asked him for a light. He leaned over to give
me one when a bullet ripped the sleeve of his coat
where his head had been just a moment before “By
!” remarked, “it pays to be ebliging some-
times.”
About five o’clock I got my second dose of medi-
cine. I do not know what hit me, but presumably
it was either shell or shrapnel. I was lying down
on my stomach when about a ton of barbed wire
seemed to drop on my back, and my pack and web
equipment were in pieces. I commenced to wriggle
lika a stricken eel. “Hey! Keep down, mate!”
someone shouted. “Keep down, be damned,” I
snorted. “What’s the use of keeping down when
your back is shot away?” I have a tendency to
exaggerate sometimes, you know.
Some instinct told me that any wound so agonising
was not necessarily fatal and I commenced to crawl
away from the ridge, looking for a Red Cross attend-
ant. Found one, and he placed a first-aid bandage
on my back, and urged me if possible to crawl to-
wards the beach, as nearly all the stretcher-bearer*
had been shot. The wound was on my left side,
'rhe projectile had ripped my back from above the
left kidney to the shoulder-blade, exposing the dorsal
muscles.
I commeneed to make towards the bench. A
stretcher passed me bearing a wounded soldier. The
front bearer was shot, and the rear man called bo a
soldier (who was paasing upward) to take the front
handles for a spelt ‘'why, certainly I will,” he
replied, and stepped acres*. They had Just rained
the stretcher, when an awful burst of shrapnel killed
the rear bearer and almost blew the head off the
wounded man. “Well, ——remarked the
newcomer to me, “What do you think of that?”
Then he picked up his gun and marched ow a« cool
as the proverbial cu number.
A couple of hundred yards further on I met a
young fellow shot through the legg, m great paia
through an over-tight bandage. Lying near hMn
was a horrible heap of what had once been a man.
While easing the wrappings he told me of the
hideous mass just by. A wounded Turk, catching
the eye of an Australian soldier, pointed to his
throat, and put his palms together begging for a
drink. The soldier walked up to him, and while
fumbling for bis waterrbag the Turk callously raised
' a nlie and shot him through the breast. At the
same moment, however, a squad of about 20 men
marched into view, and they all witnessed the inci-
dent. With a spontaneous yell of ferocity they
charged the Turk like demons. The Turk saw cer-
tain death coming, and in terror he stood on his
feet. With arms held straight above his head he
screamed, “Me surrender, Johnny; me surrenderi’ r
“You’ll surrender in Hell, you !” roared
the first man to reach him, as he dashed his brains
out with a rifle butt. A* dozen bayonets were in his
body almost before it hit the ground.
Continuing my way towards the beach, I was con-
scious of the bullets whistling more closely than
usual. All the time they were hissing overhead, but
a few commenced to kick up the ground about me,
and I wondered where in thunder they were coming
from. Suddenly I heard a yell: “Run, run like Hell!”
I did run too, and landed in the bed of a small
creek, where a corporal and about 10 men were firing
at a peak on the extreme right. “You’re a cool sort
of , you are,” the corporal remarked. “We can’t
show a finger, and you take a Sunday-afternoon
stroll.” I pleaded “not guilty.” It was not courage,
but merely ignorance. I was informed that to go
back or forward was impossible. Could I handle a
rifle still? Under the circumstances I thought 'I
could, and for about 15 minutes blazed away to the
best of my ability. Suddenly the corporal yelled
out: “Look out, boys, they’re coming!” And sure
enough they were. Over the peak they came in short
rushes, and our rifles were going as fast as we could
pull triggers.
We were quite close to the beach, and the move-
ment had been observed by the keen-eyed naval gun-
ners at sea. There was a roar ol great guns, and
the hill seemed to have been turned into a volcano.
Rocks, shrubs and earth went flying ; bodies too, .1
suppose, but I didn’t see any, and then all was still.
The corporal turned to me and said: “Righto, cob-
ber. 1 think the way is safe enough now.” It was.
I crossed the first ridge and reached the beach. At
nine o’clock that night I was on a transport. ;

It has been suggested that Morley Roberta,
novelist and friend of Gissing, is the author
of The Record of Nicholas Freydon, re-
viewed here recently. Likely. Freydon
states that he was 15 years old in the “early
seventies.” Roberts was born in 1857, which
would make him 15 in 1872 —the early seven-
ties. Like Freydon, Roberts was born in
London, and like him came to Australia as
a youth, returned to London, and had a
similar struggle as a journalist and authdr.
Freydon’s expert knowledge of the sailing
ship can be accounted for by the fact that
Roberts served before the mast. But if
Roberts is Freydon, then Roberts has adul-
terated his record with large extracts of
fiction.
Naturally we want to know all about the
Dardanelles. Melrose publishes a two-shilling
volume, The Dardanelles, their Story and their
Significance in the Great War, which, in a
scrappy way, supplies the basic information.
The history of this locality that has more
than once changed history, and looks like
doing it again, is fairly well recounted. The
landing of the Australasians is described in
Ashmead Bartlett terms of praise; and, in-
cidentally, we learn that the force that Alex-
ander of Macedon brought with him to Sestos
(Kilid Bahr) in 334 B.C. for the invasion of
Asia was just about equal in number to the
forces sent by Australia and Maoriland for
the invasion of Turkey.
“Ah Gee”: Re Reginald Bliss-Wells. My
acquaintance with Boon is limited to the
view of it on a shop counter, but I am quite
sure it is a genuine Wells. The cover or the
wrapper has a drawing of a young man in a
hurry, which undoubtedly comes from the pen
of Wells. I have made a thorough study of
the author as an artist, a capacity in which
he has been too much neglected. His tech-
nique is, perhaps, elementary, but he has a
clean and graceful “line,” as might be ex-
pected from one whose handwriting is so
neat. His early training as a schoolmaster
probably has had something to do with it
His masterpiece is, of course, the advertise-
ment sketch in Tono-Bungay, but there are
also illustrations by the author in Certain
Personal Matters and Mankind in the Mak-
ing. They accompany an essay on clay
modelling and remarks on the artistic edu-
cation of children, respectively. A letter by
Wells, reproduced in a magazine, contained
a quite unnecessary thumbnail sketch, which
shows that Wells is fond of the art. You
mentioned in your review the enraged pur-
suit of Wells by the authors he has pilloried.
It has already begun. One of them (Osborne,
I think) has perpetrated quite a good pun in
the course of it : “Mr. Wells has apparently
taken to the classics. I can almost hear his
Bohns rattling.”

“My restoration to perfect health has been so wonderful

“For about five years I SUFFERED DREADFULLY FROM
NERVOUS BREAKDOWN and INSOMNIA. The least thing
would send my whole body into a tremble. 1 would shake all
over.
“I tried medical treatment, but I gradually grew worse.
I could not eat or sleep. I HAD GIVEN UP ALL HOPE OF
EVER BEING WELL AGAIN, when a friend advised me to
try Clements Tonic.
“There is no need to tell people who saAv me two years
ago, and who can see me now. of the wonderful results of
Clements Tonic, for from the first bottle I commenced to get
better, and after I had taken six bottles I \VAS RESTORED
TO MY PRESENT STATE OF HEALTH, WHICH IS PERFECT.

Australia Riddled with
Deadly Kidney Disease
ALMOST EVERYBODY COMPLAINING.
Kidney disease is most certainly on the in-
crease. Thousands and thousands of people
in the towns and villages of this country are
in terrible danger of deadly kidney disease.
This insidious disease creeps on, gradu-
ally getting a firmer and firmer grip, until
when it is too late the poor sufferer discovers
ho has Bright’s Disease. Have you kidney
trouble? Do you know how to recognise
whether you are suffering from this or not.'
Here are some of the symptoms of kidney
disease: Aches and pains in various parts or
the body, nasty taste in the mouth first thing
in the morning, constipation, cloudy and bad-
colored urine, general feeling of weakness
and irritability, puffiness under the eyes -
these are all symptoms of kidney trouble.
And then people who suffer from backache,
rheumatism, gout, sciatica, gravel, stone or
pains in the bladder, muscles and joints are
all suffering these pains through weak or
diseased kidneys, for these are the sure and
certain symptoms of kidney trouble.
All these things mean that the kidneys are
weak and diseased. They need strengthening
and making healthy.

box of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Bills,
which are made expressly for kidney and
bladder troubles.
To cure rheumatism or any other form of
kidney trouble you must positively get rid of
the cause —the poisonous uric ac-id. Remem-
ber to do this a real remedy must pass
through the kidneys and the bladder and not
through the bowels, as most kidney pills do.
When you see the urine change to a muddy
bluish color —a feature which distinguishes
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills from all
others—you know beyond all doubt that they
have put their healing touch on the right
spot—the kidneys and the bladder. A won-
derful pill—straight to the kidneys—that is
why De Witt’s Pills give such amazingly
quick relief—every time. A permanent cure
follows in almost every case. Look for that
blue-colored urine.
They will cure every one of the above
symptoms no matter how long or how badly
you have suffered.

MAKE UP YOUR
MIND TO HAVE
A PERFECT
BUST
There are to-day hundreds of women who were once thin, flat-
bosomed, hollow-cheeked and generally seraggly in appearance, and
suffering' the effects of ana’mia and defective digestion, who are now for
the first time in their lives healthy, full-bosomed and pink-cheeked, and
enjoying the full vigor of robust womanhood, as the result of a few
weeks under our wonderful
“FLESH-FOOD” TREATMENT.
Many women whose figures have been spoiled by maternal duties
have been entirely restored to splendid form, and flat-chested young
women who suffered slow development have had the fault corrected by
this treatment with lasting effect.
Flesh-Food is totally harmless in every respect. Its efficacy is
beyond question, and its use no demand upon the subject’s time. Many
cases gained up to six pounds a week, and an increase in bust measure-
ment up to 8 and 10 inches. Guarantee given in every case.
ANY WOMAN who lacks good bust development lacks the one essential that creates a perfect
appearance. Lack of proper bust development, hollow cheeks and “salt-cellars” quickly take from
a woman the bloom and freshness of healthy womanhood. Misfortune may have been your lot in
so far as natural development is concerned, but science has found a way to correct your deficiency.
Even though you have never been full-bosomed, and though you have been attenuated all your life,
if you suffer from no wasting disease, your bosom can be fully developed and your weight increased
to normal. IT BEEN DONE FOR THOUSANDS WHY NOT YOU?
You can readily see the effect of an increase in your weight or measurements. It is not neces-
sary to imagine you are being benefited. See what Miss M. BOURKE, of Tamworth, says -
“Y ours to hand, and am pleased to state that your treatment increased my
weight considerably over two stone, and my bust measurements by several
inches. Since using it X am much better in health, and my flesh is now firm
and I feel stronger and more vigorous. I thank you for the trouble you have
taken, and am grateful for all you have done for me.”
We publish an interesting book on the subject of attenuation and develop-
ment, and will send same and a FREE SAMPLE TREATMENT to you FREE
OF CHARGE upon receipt of a 2d. stamp to pay part postage. All communica-
tions private and confidential. Write or call to-day' for full particulars. [lBlB

“If this be joy,” uiy Lady cried, ;i it slays
My shaken being with its fierce, sweet

I cannot breathe nor speak nor thinlc

My soul is lost 'mid wonder and amaze.
She lay a-tremble, while the envious Moon
Soft-swathed her gracious beauty halt
a-swoon ;
She lay with silvery glamors garmented.
“If this be joy, it is enough !” she said.
I stooped above her and paid homage to
Her grace incomparable without alloy.
All white she was, save where bloods lire
shone through
To call me to beatitude anew. .

Snow Time.
The trees are snowing;
Slow quivering down
From clusters knotting
The branches brown.
Through golden air
Vibrant with bee„s.
Fall fragrant flakes
From the orchard trees.
The wandering wind
With lingers light
Hobs each soft star
(>f its garland white,
And, singing, scatters
A pearly drift
On the long, green grasses
That bend and lift.
The clouds a-sailing
Are petals blown
From flowers that bloom
For the gods alone ;
The sky is azure.
And far below
The trees are strewing
The earth with snow.

The Luck of the New Moon.
’Twas a small, little thing would be driving
a man,
’Twas a fine, little dream would be hold-
ing a girl —
“Oeli, Molly McCabe, will you come if you
can
When you’re given the wheel in the cor-
ner a twirl?”
Sure, she rose at the word. Sure, she came
to the door.
“Och, Pat, ’tis the fancy that makes you
so bold.
’Twill be eyes for the sight of ns two will
be sore.
Ocli, whist! Will you go there, again,
when you’re told?”
“ ’Tis not telling will keep me from sight of
your eyes.
Girl, throw on your shawl and come up
to the hill.
There’s a young moon this night, and be
sure she will rise
With .good luck for us two if we're mind-
ing her still.”
She has put on her shawl, she is out at his
side.
The sun has just gone and the evening
is fair.
Oeh, sure, the young moon looks up white
like a bride.
A bride with white blossoms to put in her
hair.
They are high on the hillside. Now what
will they see?
Is it small, quiet music that comes from
the thorn?
There’s a wall of grey stones, and young
laughter and free
Runs in and runs out of McAlister’s corn.
They turned the white silver, they wished
in the moon,
They looked till their four eyes were
weary that night.
Oeh, heart, it was dark, but the small, little
tune
From the thorn on the hillside seemed
giving them light.
Sure, at sunset; they went. In the dark
they came down.
’Twas Molly that took off her shoes at the
door.
Small blame to you. Pat —Oeh, her eyes
were so brown !—-
When you put your two arms round the
shawl that she wore.
’Twas her waist was so slim, ’twas her lips
had a taste —
Troth, boys, when he kissed her she
laughed like a queen.
Oeh, heart, would they hear her? ’Twas
pity to waste
A good kiss at parting. ’Twas worse to
he seen.
Wh at more? Was it fairies they saw on
the hill?
Sure, they saw and they heard, but they
never let on.
And the luck of the new moon is keeping
them still,
Though their fancy for thorn trees at
night may be gone.
And ’tis Molly that gives her old wheel a
good twirl.
While Pat takes a smoke and the turf
fire is bright,
’Tis a fine, little dream will be holding a
girl
And the small folk are kind to young-
lovers at night.

HOW LONG-?
One of the many queer truths which the
wap has demonstrated is that Britain is no
longer an island. That is to say, for pur-
poses of defence. The element which used
to guard the Kingdom from invasion is
still there; but as a bulwark it has lost its
virtue. Britain, which for nearly nine cen-
turies has not looked upon an invader, is
being invaded, after a fashion, every other
day. It is only necessary that mankind’s
mastery of the air should become a little
more complete, and the territory which was
considered once to be inviolable must be-
come as accessible to a European enemy as
Belgium or Servia. There is nothing fan-
tastic about the proposition. It is as logic-
ally inevitable as the march of the motor-
car was 10 years ago, as the destiny of the
aeroplane was from the moment of the first
successful flight. In the light of the events
of the past 12 months it becomes apparent
that Germany made the worst of its many
mistakes when it arranged for Armageddon
to begin in 1914. Had it waited, the British
fleet’s usefulness for home defence pur-
poses would have been discounted, if not
nullified : a descent upon England from the
air would have been almost as easy as the
subsequent subjugation of the absurdly in-
adequate army which would have met the
invaders. That chance will never come now,
since, no matter how things go on the Con-
tinent, some form of conscription must pre-
sently arrive in the United Kingdom.
Conscription in Britain is going to mean
conscription in the oversea dominions. The
only question in any of the interested coun-
tries can be: How long before it comes?
The Commonwealth has sent, so far, about
76,000 men to Turkey. They have given
Australia a better advertisement than the
same number of High Commissioners could
if they toiled ceaselessly for 100 years.
Those who have not been killed or incapaci-
tated are hanging on by the skin of their
teeth to the ground they have won. A des-
perate effort is being made to reinforce them
adequately by means of recruiting devices
of different sorts. The recruiters have done
fairly well here and there, but in the
majority of centres they have confessedly
failed. There are reasons why they must
fail more and more as time goes on. This
country has already despatched to the Front
or has in training for the Front about 12
per cent, of its men of a fighting age. Most
of them represent the adventurous spirits,
the eager, virile, danger-seeking section of
the community. The insignificant residue
thought that the war would be over before
they got there—that they were being given
a unique chance to combine the pleasures of
foreign travel with an honorable and lucra-
tive job. lhe congenital lovers of danger
and seekers of trouble have nearly all left,
lhose who were not in the first rushes have
to be sought out now with bloodhounds and
a spy-glass. And no one is under the delu-
sion any longer that this war can be
regarded as a pleasant outing. The public
understands that, if the Allies are to win,
i£"* gle must , be loD S and bloody. So
the dilettante warrior has ceased coming for-
ward with great unanimity. Taking the
nosition by and large, it is highly improbable
that the voluntary system of recruiting will
work halt so well in the second as it did in
the first year of warfare. What are the
politicians going to do about it? Are they
take a chance—the chance of dis-
affecting some of the electors? Or would
they rather risk sacrificing their brave
tellow countrymen abroad than imperil their
own political hold on a few anti-conscrip-
tionist shirkers at home’
*
tbe .ethical side of the question,
lhe business side is equally obvious. Aus-
tralia needs a big army, and needs it soon.
lor at least three good reasons. It wants
rt primarily to help finish the war quickly.
The extra 150,000 Australians that national
service would throw into Turkey might
bring the end of the tragedy nearer by six
months. If so, those soldiers would be the
best investment a country ever made. They
would pay for themselves in diminished war-
a bunc l re dfold. Assuming that
the Allies win, Australia needs a powerful
army for bargaining purposes. It has been
saicl bitterly by a foreign commentator that
-Britain always enters upon war with a weak
army and emerges from it with a strong one.
lhat is true. And as in the past, so
now. When the great day of reckoning
comes, and the losing belligerents are being
penalised by the_ confiscation of cash and
territory, the nations to score will be those
who are in a position to talk. Australia,
with the war-worn remnant of its original
expeditionary force, and a handful of cadets
and militia at home, would necessarily be
a very diffident party by comparison with
an Australia in the possession of a quarter of
a million well-trained and equipped expedi-
tionanes, plus another quarter of a million
partially-trained men in the Commonwealth,
lhere is a third consideration, and there is
no profit in forgetting it. The war may
not go all our way. Great disasters may
come. The oversea parts of the British
Empire may be called upon to look after
themselves while the United Kingdom is
fighting for its life. If any one of a dozen
or more perfectly conceivable calamities
occurred in Europe, what hope would a
weak Australia have of remaining inviolate?
But with a trained army, comprising all its
fit males of a fighting age, the question of
foreign attack would hardly arise.
One of the two commonest objections to a
compulsory army for service abroad was
put last week by a champion swimmer. He
said that “the quarrel was not Australia’s,”
and he inferred that Australia was not being
defended in Gallipoli. In truth, it is being
defended wherever the robber of the world
is doing business. The present set of cir-
cumstances may occur again. No one
could have foreseen them in their entirety.
But the plain meaning of them is that Aus-
tralia is being aimed at via Belgium and
the coast of France and Dover as effectually
as though German transports were prepar-
ing to land men at Port Melbourne or Cir-
cular Quay. If Russia is crushed before
Turkey can be defeated, then France is in
hideous peril; and if France went the way
of Belgium and Poland, Britain would be
too heavily engaged to assist Australia
against any foe, European or Asiatic, for
years to come. It is immaterial that the
trenches in which our soldiers are fighting
are not on Australian soil. The work in
them has as much relation to the national
future as though it was being done at Goul-
burn or Wodonga. The other objection is
that a conscript army, even if it is only
for the duration of the war, is a bigger
burden than the taxpayers will care to
carry. It certainly is a big burden. But
the_ issue is also big. And, in any event,
it is no vaster than poorer countries have
sustained through years of peace and com-
parative security. Roumania, for example,
with a population not much greater than
that of the Commonwealth, and with a much
smaller revenue, has a formidable army of
close on half a million. Bulgaria has for
years considered that the maintenance of
400,000 soldiers was not too great a price
to pay for freedom. Even disreputable old
Turkey, with little money and less credit,
and the consciousness that it is the outcast
among the nations, has not for many years
fallen below the 350,000 mark. What 'these
countries have done in the name of honor,
Australia cannot shrink from in the same
same cause.
NEW TENTACLES FOR OLD.
A few weeks ago the Sydney Chamber of
Commerce organised an exhibition of goods
of German manufacture which the Com-
monwealth used to import before the war.
One of those dailies which have been in the
habit of boosting the foreign import trade
was so depressed by the object-lesson that it
held forth in this strain: —
One is astounded at the extent to which the German
octopus has succeeded in wreathing its tentacles about
Australian trade and Australian every-day life. Appar-
ently we have been almost entirely dependent upon
Germany for the most ordinary articles of our civil-
isation. We have been wearing Teuton clothes,
Teuton hats, Teuton gloves and Teuton boots.
Our windows have been draped with Ger-
man ,curtains; we have eaten from Ger-
man tables while seated on German chairs, and slept
upon German beds. Grown rich by selling German
importations, we have decked our women-folk with
German jewellery, and aroused the devil of envy in
our neighbors by lording it abroad in German motor-
cars. Several Dreadnoughts and half a dozen sub-
marines—that, roughly speaking, represents the yearly
assistance which Australia by her importation policy
has been giving cheerfully to Germany.
After mentioniug that, in the process of
“helping very materially to strangle genuine
Australian industries,” the Commonwealth
has been sending to Germany annually over
7i millions sterling per annum, the journal
propounded a remedy. A genuinely Protec-
tive tariff? Nothing of the sort! It urged
the Government to publish a list of trade-
marks, so that buyers could discriminate
between German and other imports!
* * * *
The Bulletin is unable to comprehend
the mental process of the Australian who
can contemplate calmly the spectacle of any
nation being allowed to “strangle genuine
Australian industries.” Germany was friendly
last year, and so by some strange freak of logic
the S. M. Herald and the Argus could see
nothing wrong with a tariff which allowed
a quarter of a million pounds’ worth of
German furniture and half a million
pounds’ worth of German apparel to help
kill our mills and manufactories. Japan is
friendly this year, and with the able assist-
ance of the tariff it has already got on our
industries the jiu-jitsu hold which Germany
has been forced to relinquish. From a com-
mercial point of view the Japanese are even
more dangerous than the Germans. They
are cheaper, more industrious, equallv
thorough, and nearer to our markets. They
can make anything, because they can copy
anything. They have been making cheap
pianos for years. They make hats, caps,
drugs, perfumes, soaps, textiles, canned
goods of all sorts, toys, brassware, pottery,
and a thousand other articles at a price the
mention of which would cause an Aus-
tralian union worker to turn faint. There
is one way and one only in which a low-
tariff country like Australia can hope to
compete in manufactures with Japan. It
must abandon its industrial machinery of
minimum wages and factory laws, wipe out
its Wages Boards a,nd Arbitration Courts,
and come to the social level of its competi-
tors. And it must take to the Japanese
system of household manufacture. Samuel
Blythe, an American traveller ana writer,
said lately:—
With the exception of cotton goods there is no
article of Japanese export or use that I ever heard of
—not including heavy machinery and things of that
sort —which the Japanese do not make in their own
homes. Literally they work all the time. It is not
at all uncommon to find Japanese men and women at
work in their shops at two, three and four o’clock
in the morning. They work until they are exhausted.
Then they sleep a little and go back to work.
There are three alternatives before the
Australian Government. One is to abandon
its factory system, and educate the workers
down to a lower standard of living. As this
would necessitate a fish-and-rice diet and 15
hours’ work a day for about 80 per cent, of
the population, it would be a big undertak-
ing. The second is to allow the fiscal ques-
tion to drift as in the past. This is the
course which must appeal to any ease-loving
Party Government, at least during the cur-
rency of the war. It avoids the creation of
strife, and it is not going to produce the
out-of-work in dangerously large numbers,
since at present the recruiting-stations mop
him up as fast almost as he materialises.
The trouble will come when the war is over,
and some other Government has the task
of sweeping up the mess. There will be no
army then to absorb those workers who can-
not find a job owing to the factories having
been slain by cheap alien labor. It may be
that Australia in those days will see a repe-
tition of what happened in France in 1871,
when _ the working people, discovering the
inability of the Commune to handle the
situation, actually clamored for the return
of the Germans. There are wealthy men
in Australia to-day who are not ashamed to
say that they would as soon have German
domination as government by the Labor
party. _ Similarly there may be poor men
who will say, when the war ends, that they
prefer Germanism and a tariff which will
at least provide them with a job, to a Gov-
ernment under which they find themselves
workless. The way to obviate such a
calamity is to at once institute a tariff that
will keep Australian industries safe against
attack from any quarter, until our men
come back from the war and the “business
as usual” sign goes up again. Is the
Fisher Government game to do its duty in
this respect? Does it consider the trade
tentacles of an Asiatic country any more
desirable than those of a European country?
A LETTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Here in the trench up on Gallipoli
Things seem quite different from what they
were
When life went lilting through delicious
days.
True that I loved you then, and that was
great:
True that I love you now, as here I squat
And scribble cheek-by-jowl with leaping
Death,
While just above us all the air is torn
By screaming shrapnel, and the following
wind
Is soured by human carrion near at hand,
Each lump of carrion a man like me
No longer than two days ago. True ’tis
That as I squat with Death familiarly
I still count all things nothing if but you
Are mine as when we kissed.
And yet to-day
I want to say that I your lover am
The man I was when you were w0n....
and yet
A man quite other. If you care for me,
Mark now this other chap, for with that one
You’ll live and eat and sleep till death in-
trudes,
If in one piece I get safe through with this
Damned business of war.
Now listen, dear!
When (ages since) boy Love took you and
me
And squeezed us in one handful till we
grew
Into one heart together, I was young,
An arrogant selfish sprig of youth, an ass
That held the world his thistle. All things
then
I took as mine by right—my mother’s love,
My father’s genial comradeship, my luck
la business, the sea we loved so well.
The trees, the hills, the sky, the night of
stars,
The never-ending miracle of the dawn,
Good kindly folks, yourself, the blessed joy
Of love, the sweets of friendship—all I took
As mine by right. I was a sorry thing,
And how you came to love me.... God! that
is
The miracle of miracles that now
Astounds and humbles me beyond all else!
Don’t fear this other chap. He’s better far
Than that false self of mine that wooed and
won
You—when was it? —a thousand years
ago
(Pielinger, whom we met at Wentworth
Falls
Last Faster... .Well, he proved a rattling
sore,
A staunch, good fellow in a thousand ways.
Two days ago they rushed us on a bit,
And things were hot and lively. Pillinger,
Half-way across, laughed, cheered, and then
a shell
That ripped him into bits. It makes one
think.)
I’m no great shakes, God knows ; but now
and then
I have been thinking lately. By the Lord.
It’s horrible to think, when face to face
M itli all this bestial cruelty of war !
Who made the thrice-damned thing? Who
lets it be?
Not G0d....n0t that! Men made it, little
men,
Mean men self-satisfied and pawky, smug
And garrulous, fat, sleek men who couldn’t
run
A mile to keep their stomachs out of Hell.
War is a game tnat politicians play
When they are most swelled-headed. Well,
who makes
The politicians? Who? Why, you and I!
Here well I know, now I have tasted war,
That war itself is vile unutterably.
In all my bones I feel that after this
The mourning peoples of the world must
strike
Tlieir . hands, and speak, and make an end
ot war.
If politicians scheme for war—why, then
To Hell with politicians ! And if kings
Cannot maintain their state if they must
yield
Their right of wholesale murder, then to
Hell
With kings! Or man goes back into the
dark.
Back from this war to lands bereaved will
troop
Millions of fellows sick to death of war.
When rogues and mild men-women whine
and squeak
About “the curse of Socialism” our men
Will, say, “What about War?” The mouth-
ing shirks
Who preach and snort about the moral
state
Of Smith and Jones will meet with grim-
jawed men
Who’ll say, “What about War?”
It has to come.
The time is coming when babes at the
breast
Will suck in with their very mothers’ milk
The hate of war. I’m in it, to the neck.
I half enjoy it that’s the rotten thing!
Men perish, and each man behind a gun
Still finds a sort of pleasure in himself
As one of Hate’s ten million hands that
stink
Of the red shame they drip with That is
war!
You, little girl, who sit and wait for me
Out there among your roses by the bay,
If I come to you in due time and take
The sweetness of you to restore my soul,
Think you I shall be less your natural mate,
Being the man I am, than if I came
The man I was a year ago? Pray you
That war shall cease, that reason shall
ascend
Her throne, and graciously benignant rule
Henceforth the destinies of men. Pray you
That out of strife at length shall come the
bond
Of brotherhood. A thousand girls a day
Are now bereft of lovers. Through the world
Ten thousand homes are desolate. Stricken
lands
Are full of clamors of sweet women shamed
As death could never shame them.... That
is war.

FRANK MORTON.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Hobbled in the Face of the Enemy.
The London Times discussed the Referenda
question last week, and its views on the
subject were much the same, apparently,
as those of The Bulletin. It mentioned
that “the case for the amendment of the Con-
stitution was very strong from the legal
point of view,” but regretted “the stream of
abuse, innuendo and recrimination which
will overflow Australia” as soon as the cam-
paign begins. If the London paper had
known more about local conditions it might
also have deplored the waste of money and
time. The ill-feeling, the money and the
time might all be saved by the adoption
of the scheme which The Bulletin sub-
mitted a month ago; viz., the passing of a
Bill conferring on Parliament for the cur-
rency of the war all the powers which it
requires, the measure to be immediately
validated in toto by the High Court, as pro-
vided for by the Judiciary Act. The best
men of both political parties recognise that
Parliament needs more powers. But there
is an understandable resentment on the
Liberal side at the suspicion that the Labor-
ites mean to exploit the requirements of the
war for the purpose of scoring a political
point. If the Constitution is altered
under such circumstances the amend-
ment will not be allowed to stand.
The Tories are bound _ to agitate for
a reversion to the old position on the ground
that the alterations were achieved by means
of a trick. And, most undesirable of all,
there is the very considerable chance that
after the creation of infinite ill-feeling, the
waste of months, and the expenditure of


much money, the Government’s proposals
may be defeated. There is nothing to be
gained by shutting our eyes to the fact that
the war is not likely to begin going our way
for many months to come. The Russian
steam-roller of which so much was ex-
pected by the optimists has been on the
reverse gear for weeks; and those well
qualified to judge are now suggesting that it
may yet be driven stern foremost through
Petrograd itself. The Commonwealth must
feel the reaction of such a calamity as much
as most of the anti-German nations, and the
first institution to suffer from the effects of
the popular uneasiness and mistrust would
be the Government. It may be unreason-
able, but it always is so. By the pi’esent
look of things, the end of the year should be
about the most fatal time for the Australian
Government to go to the country on a con-
tentious issue. Once more this paper urges
the leaders of both parties to get together
and arrange the only practicable compro-
mise. Parliament cannot afford to wait for
the powers which it should have had when
the war started; and it can still less afford
to run the risk of never getting them at all.
The Loot of Peace and War.
A RAY of light shines through the circling
gloom—Fat newspapers are beginning to
make remarks about “war profits.” Ram-
bling remarks, naturally; yet very sugges-
tive Sydney Telegraph, for instance, was
horrified the other day, after digesting the
taxation schedules, when it thought of a
few people “enriching themselves at the ex-
pense of the rest” in time of war. After a
passionate insistence that everyone was
entitled to the fair rewards he got before
the great trouble, it came to this conclusion:
A war profit pure and simple is no more and no
less than a blackmail levied on patriotism, and when
market manipulators conspire to extort this from
the people in their hour of trial they should re-
ceive no more consideration than is given to ordinary
blackmailers.
All of which is very fine, but very nebulous.
Who are these people? Here and there an
agent for freight and other things might be
discovered who is doing well; a very few
people interested in the deep-sea shipping
trade are making more than usual; a small
handful of meat men got in on the early
doors when War Office orders were being
thrown round. But with these and maybe
a few other exceptions, Australian commer-
cial enterprise of every kind has been hard
hit lately, and much of it is going to be hit
harder directly. Still if the Telegraph
knows of any blackmailing its clear duty is
to give the country something more infor-
mative than exclamatory periods. Pending
that further information, The Bulletin
wants to protest against the digging of this
great gulf between shearing the public in
times of peace and fleecing them in times of
war. Between the exploitation of society by
seizing upon the favorable conditions attend-
ing the days of amity and utilising the condi-
tions incidental to war, where is the moral
distinction? Social robbery is a crime at
any time, and it is no use trying to pretend
that what is respectable at midday becomes
shameful at four o’clock. If the community
suspects that in an hour of national trial
Boodle and Co. are filling their pockets
with gold raked from the cannon’s mouth, it
frantically yells to have the robbers relieved
of their spoil. But what about the innumer-
able boodlers who by looting society at other
times weaken its power of resistance? The
world is full of syndicates and concession-
hunters and peddlers of options; of rent-
mongers, slum landlords and land sharks; of
sweaters and pirates—a greedy, ravenous
crew who wring from the mass of men and
women a perpetual toll of cash and life and
misery, as great in the aggregate as has to
be paid for war. But what Fat newspaper
ever demanded that the blackmail should
stop? Yet blackmail it all was, and is, as
certainly as that word properly describes
the gains of the new millionaires now in the
making in Europe and America. The coun-
try that carefully sandbags its peace black-
mailers is the one that will have the least
number of war burglars to bother about.

Ten Million Leaping Citizens.
While Uncle Sam has been busy writing
Notes it looks as if Brother Jonathan had
remarked to Cousin Silas that the back
door wanted a new lock and the roof a few
tiles to keep the rain off the bed. There-
fore keels are being laid for things called
super-Dreadnoughts, a flock of submarines
has been ordered, and equipment is to be
provided for a million men ashore. Appar-
ently the whole Sam family has been get-
ting a bit sick of Notes—especially since
William Jennings Bryan smote the Re-
public with the remark that if the national
honor was at stake “a million men would
spring to arms in a single day.” No doubt,
if prodded hard enough, they would spring
all right. Indeed, Bryan wag on such solid
ground about this that he sprung a bit
himself and next declared that “ ten million
men would leap forward if the country
called.” But how much better off would
the country be for this multitudinous leap—
for this great, unanimous spring? Mere
leaping is a futile exercise. The 10 mil-
lions might almost as well hop. Roosevelt’s
reply to Bryan was an unanswerable exhor-
tation to shut off the hot air and get ready:
To what kind of arms would we spring? About
400.000 might get some sort of rifle, with luck.
Another 600,000 might get some antiquated sort of
shotgun—perhaps a modern fowling-piece, possibly
an ancient blunderbuss. The remaining 9,000,000
would be leaping to pitchforks, scythes, corkscrews,
gimlets, pocket-knives, saws .and axes.
At the best the latest proposals to provide
additional equipment will leave 8.000.000
of Bryan’s springing citizens armed w'-v
nothing more substantial than pie. Still
the arming of two millions is “a darned'
sight better than nothing,” as Ulysses S.
Grant remarked when he got two donkeys
instead of a thousand. With these weapons
to replace mere leap, Uncle Sam may find
his Notes cutting more ice. while strangers
without the gates are likely to become less
anxious to throw torpedoes at travelling
U.S. citizens.
Our Splendid Wastefulness.
Every five minutes or so during the past
20 years an Australian politician somewhere
or other has been heard making emphatic
remarks about his intention to at once con-
serve the State timber supplies and do some-
thing large in the way of afforestation. Then,
having sat down to grant timber-cutting
rights or detach a slice of forest land for
settlement, he has made a further explana-
tion that this business must be run on
scientific principles, and that he refuses to be
trifled with any longer. But no one now
seriously imagines that there is one politician
with chest-measurement enough to stand for
public rights and national needs in this mat-
ter. Trees have no votes, but people who
want timber and the other people who want
land have. Therefore, another fire is lighted,
another bush is tackled with axe and saw,
a few pockets are filled, and Australia has
another collection of blackened stumps and
shavings. So far as the days to come are
concerned, and such questions as water and
soil conservation go-—why worry? While the
politicians continue to rapidly move their
faces, and forget to do anything else, this is
a sample of what is going on (Sydney Tele-
graph, 31/7/T5) :
The timber growing on the plateau is the finest.
It comprises valuable hardwoods and brushwoods,
and this splendid asset is going up in smoke to
make room for grass.... The writer has seen de-
stroyed on one section alone in a single day a
hundred silky oaks, any one of which would have
been worth £lO. Beech, rosewood and cedar went
up in the same fire the same day. There are scores
of such holdings being improved by removing the
splendid timber.
The question is not now how much longer
such folly shall be allowed, but how much
longer will the trees last. Such destruction
as is here chronicled represents public policy
in the last stages of senile decay. The gag
about the annihilation of forests being neces-
sary in order that settlement may be
encouraged is merely an insolent and
lazy evasion, since the open lands
contiguous to roads and railways carry
only a fraction of the population they
should. To burn off hardwoods and
rosewood and cedar at any time argues a stu-
pidity almost beyond conception. To do it
in the name of settlement at places so remote
that the alternative of transport is impossible
discloses a cynical indifference to a great
national asset and a bankruptcy of resource.
Every generation has something on hand to
curse its predecessor for, and the frantic
haste with which Australia has been lighting
bonfires makes certain of there being at least
one ground on which the inert, pettifogging
Bumbles of to-day will have deserved recol-
lection in abundant expletives. Over in
Maoriland it is as bad: the wiping of trees
off the face of the earth is one of the great
industries, and in the bush districts the par-
sons pray every summer for a few days’ fine
weather, in order that the sacrificial burning
may be absolute —yea, even unto the last twig
and the ultimate leaf.
Concerning a Small Superstition.
The dailies say “the mining market” is
very quiet; and we are expected to regard
this as an unalloyed national misfortune.
But if it means that people, feeling the
pinch of the times, are neglecting to rush
in and buy bits of paper at ridiculous
prices, it is nothing of the sort. All over
the continent are engines, batteries, pumps,
poppet legs, and holes in the ground, aban-
doned and useless, and all representing good
wealth derived from other industries and
wasted in what is alleged to be mining.
Many people think that when some man is
ass enough to take £lOOO that he has made
in the business he understands and cast it
into mining which he doesn’t understand
(thereby almost inevitably losing it), it is
good for the country, because it circulates
money, provides work, etc. As a matter of
fact, the cash would circulate even if he
only banked it. But the point missed is
that in expending it on a valueless mine the
productive value of so much money is lost.
A. good deal of confusion exists as to “losing
money,.” and it is well to say now and then
that when money is spent digging a value-
less hole, the cause for regret is, not that it
is lost absolutely, but that it has simply
been transferred from one person to an-
other, the second person having earned it by
doing work that is worthless and wasted as
far as the community is concerned. If the
same money had been expended in clearing
or tilling land, constructing railways, or
making anything useful to the community,
the nation would still own the £lOOO, plus
the serviceable article produced with it.
Keeping that in view, it is possible to real-
ise that any industry which yields far less
than it costs is a loss to the community;
and if gold mining’s only reason for exist-
ence is that it effects a transfer of good
cash from asses who pay to more sensible
people who receive, incidentally keeping a
swarm of sharks fat and prosperous in an
overcrowded city, then the sooner gold
mining ceases to exist the better. Gold is,
after all, only a labor-saving device for
facilitating the barter of commodities, and
if it absorbs too much labor in its produc-
tion its value as a mere convenience will be
outweighed. Man invented gold coinage to
expedite and facilitate barter; he has, since
barter grew out of all proportion to the pro-
duction of gold, invented ways of effecting
most of his barter without anything more
than the name of gold entering into it, and
it is not impossible for him to invent a way
of doing the remaining business without
gold when gold is too unprofitable. Look-
ing at the general tendency of the gold yield
everywhere, he will have to do without it in
the end. These few incoherent remarks
may, therefore, be taken as insinuating that
there may not be reason for widespread
national grief because it is more difficult to
float the Gilded Goat or the Doleful Diorite
propositions, so long as there is enough
capital around to produce the things we
really want. If several “mining experts”
have in consequence to take to work, it may
doubtless cause them much grief, but they
may then really earn their own keep instead
of being mere parasites, and that will be
no national misfortune.

If the purpose of the exculpatory memoran-
dum received by Attorney-General Hughes
from the chief censor at Melbourne was to
make the system look still more ridiculous,
it succeeds admirably. The censorship has
not been employed in Australia, except in-
cidentally, to prevent certain news of mili-
tary value reaching the enemy. It has been
mainly used for the purpose of ensuring that
the public received through the newspapers
only such information and comment about the
war and the administration of military
affairs in Australia as the censors have
thought it desirable the public should read.
And as the “work” has been done by Tom,
Dick and Harby and numerous cock-spar-
rows, the result has been just as absurd as
might have been expected. In Britain the
people have not once or twice, but dozens
of times, been kept in ignorance of things
that were common property all over Europe
and America. Until lately they were sys-
tematically chloroformed. It was not merely
humiliating; it was disastrous. It cost
millions of money and thousands of lives: it
came very near to costing us our Imperial
dominion. So far as Australia is concerned,
the sudden command of “Hush” had not had
even the negative virtue it may possibly
have had in London, for this country is
thousands of miles away from the scene of
military and naval activity. The system has
been the jest of every newspaper office in
the Commonwealth, and is so still. To give
but one instance, does anyone suppose that
the interests of Australia and the Empire
were served by throttling the newspapers
until a Royal Commission had to be ap-
pointed to inquire into the administration at
a bic military encampment?
♦ :
The lamentable Closer Settlement Board of
Victoria being about to pass away, leaving
a dirty mess for somebody to clean up, it is
for the State Parliament to see that the
Board’s powers are not transferred to the
hopeless Lands Department. In the first
place, no Closer Settlement Board would
ever have had a chance to do anything in
a wrong, extravagant way if the Department
had been properly progressive. But it seems
incapable of action on its own initiative,
and appears to be merely open to the ap-
proaches of private individuals. Illustrations
of its disgraceful negligence have been star-
ing Melbourne in the face for years past.
Acres of Crown land at the southern end of
Princes’ Bridge are leased to a showman on
terms which permit him to make a profit,
albeit the area remains mostly idle, and valu-
able building sites are as bare as any
suggestion. A considerable tract of coun-
try at the corner of St. Kilda and Domain
roads has, for years, been nominally restored
to the South Yarra Domain, from which it
was originally purloined ; yet it is still reli-
giously fenced off from public approach. The
scandal dates back to the early days of
Willie Watt’s Premiership, when the
Crown re-acquired the stolen land for
£30.000 from a purchaser whose title deeds
were questionable, with the alleged purpose
of removing the bricks and mortar, pulling
up numerous fences and merging the area
into the adjoining public reserve. But it
never has been so merged; and Willie
Watt paid £30,000 of public money for a
triangular stretch of park which the Lands
Department still dedicates to the service of
a caretaker and a few browsing quadrupeds.
With such examples of departmental policy
visible from Melbourne tram-cars, can a
reasonably honest State Parliament hand
the control of closer settlement to the same
tape-bound, discredited officials? As for the
Minister of the Department, he doesn’t
count. He is the flitting figurehead who
changes with each Government; the mere
ghost of circumstances who haunts the
Treasury Building for a space and then
melts into nothingness.
♦
Half a dozen little co-operative flourmills
are making excellent profits in N. S. Wales ;
but they handle a mere trifle of the harvest,
and such mills in other States handle practi-
cally nothing at all. Why? Prima facie,
a tremendously strong case can be made out
for local milling. Apart from the saving ol
freight on the wheat and flour locally con-
sumed, the “offal” —bran and pollard—is
kept where large quantities are wanted, and
where it can do most good by return to the
soil. Australia pays for a vast deal of waste-
ful and unnecessary hauling backwards and
forwards —a vast deal for which the conges-
tion policy is responsible and a vast deal for
which it isn’t—and the burdening of the
railways with goods which need not be
carried means delay and loss in connection
with the goods which must be railed. Local
milling has obvious advantages over every
other system ; milling within Australia comes
next; the export of wheat, involving the loss
to the country of the offal which we ought to
be feeding to stock and restoring to the soil,
and for which we net practically nothing if
we send it oversea, is the most wasteful of
all. The reform calls for co-operation—the
same co-operation which has turned butter-
making into one of our great industries. The
States’ Agricultural Departments have thus
far done wretchedly little for the business
they are supposed to foster. Here is a
tremendously big organising job ready to
their hands ; and not merely the organisation
of farmers for co-operative milling, but for
the handling and eventually the manufacture
of cornsacks, fertilisers and other munitions.

Leyton Biciiards, the reverend nuisance
who, after being imported to Collins-street
Congregational pulpit, joined the Melbourne
shriekers against Australia’s compulsory-
service scheme, is making much noise in
Britain as a champion of the shirkers. In
Manchester, where he now sends round the
plate, he has assisted a few other traitors
to establish a “No-Conscription Fellowship”
among “men of enlistment age who are not
prepared to bear arms in the event of con-
scription, whatever the penalties for refus-
ing.” This is not the full extent of the
reverend person’s crime. He has rushed to
the Labor press with a half-page of wild
screams and infamous lies concerning the
Australian Defence Act and its workings. He
quotes a number of the Regulations which
were designed to meet special circumstances
—and which are tame compared with some
of the sudden-death threats of the British
Army Act Regulations—to prove that “civil
liberty, religious liberty, liberty of speech
and liberty of conscience” have been ground
under the heel of militarism. “But four years
have gone by,” he says, “and Australia is
beginning to learn from bitter experience
that a nation in arms is a nation of slaves,”
though no lie could be blacker than the lie
that Australia feels that it has gone too far
in this matter, and wants to make its poor
little bit of military service less stringent.
Richards’S talk of organising civil war and
his appeal to Australia recalls another Aus-
tralian incident that he might appeal to.
John Hancock was doing some wild talk
in the Victorian Assembly 20-odd years ago.
“Thank God for the sacred right of revolu-
tion !” he cried. “And thank God for the
sacred right of hanging!” snapped Duncan
Gillies. Is there any law against hanging
traitors who happen to be Congregational
parsons named Richards?
«
“Shiverpool” : While politicians are making
themselves hoarse in appealing for recruits,
enlisted men who have exhausted the charms
of Liverpool have been deliberately getting
themselves emptied out of the service. And
they are not all slackers, either. Five months
ago a good Sydney-side Australian gave up a
responsible, well-paid post to do his national
duty. Five solid months of unnecessary dis-
comfort on the wretched Liverpool river-bank
doused his spark of patriotism so thoroughly
that he finally broke leave and several more
military commandments in order to get him-
self dismissed with the loss of £6 pay. “I
would have gladly forfeited twice the
money!” was his comment, as he cleared out
to hunt for another civil job. In this
matter, as in so many others, we are really
paying the price of our stupid voluntary sys-
tem. In years past three-fourths of the men
who stuck to the militia and pushed on to
rank were not inspired by either duty or
patriotism; they were inspired by the uni-
form and the handle to their name. It is
easy enough to picture the sort of man
whom these things would lure on. Everybody
knows him. Most people laugh at him.
There are others, of course. But those others,
when not actually on crutches, have been
shipped off to the Front if they were willing
to go. It is mostly from the sediment that
the Defence Department has had to pick men
to officer the home jobs.
“On to Berlin !” : Round the corner came
a squad of bandsmen in shoddy uniforms,
worn anyhow. In front, a distressed-look-
ing flag. Some bystander identified the
sorry lot as patriotic musicians come on re-
cruiting business to catch the lunch-time
lounger. It may be all right for the nation
to hold out its hat for small change; but
isn’t it humiliating to see it trailing the
flag round the town for men? It may be
possible to win this war by getting soldiers
as revivalist preachers get converts; but
even if the result is all right, what do you
think of the means? As for myself, every
time I see one of the patriotic circuses the
thought strikes me that England is only
preserving her precious ideal of volunteer
armies by having allies who are conscrip-
tionists.
“If I Return.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I’E do so and 50... ..if I return.”
— Every-day remark.
If I return and sit at last
Beside some hearth-fire safe and sound,
Maybe I’ll send some tales around
About our doings of the Past;
Of stairs that twist from musty lanes,
Weird dens of sin with latticed doors,
Fierce gasping fights in corridors,
Slave-market walls with rusty stains;
Peach-colored dawns with opal mists,
The snaky camel-train that steals
Past oxen plodding round the wheels;
Gold bangles loading women’s wrists;
The flash of anklets through the dust,
Veiled women round the village well
(What dark eyes say no tongue may tell
Of hate of hate, of lust of lust) ;
Grey ships in rows on azure seas
Where fish like silver parrots fly;
Strange lights that blink and wink and
die;
The roll of gunfire down the breeze;
Peaked islands from the sea that start,
And curved white sails that dot the blue;
Tired little birds of alien hue
That rest awhile and then depart;
A hundred breeds of men that meet
And strive with tales in broken speech—
Sad tales o-f homes far out of reach ;
Barbaric music weird and sweet;
Huge tombs of priests, and dust of kings
Rising beneath our careless tread,
While bristling kites swing overhead—
A thousand thousand wondrous things;
Huge shells that roar like railway trains,
Him smoke-bursts hurling shattered men;
The gasping bayonet-charge, and then
Torn uniforms with dreadful stains;
Still heaps beneath the outspread flag;
The wolf-like captive’s pleading eye;
The firing-party plodding by,
Quiet heads beneath a bloody rag;
Wry heaps of clothes that clutch and sprawl,
And ghastly boys that fight for air;
Odd twisted mouths, wide eyes that stare,
Blue skies and sunshine over all;
White naked shapes all queerly slashed,
And those who see and catch the breath
And yell with rave and rush on death
Among the rocks all leaden-splashed;
Huve fleets of ships that come and go
With snouting shells flung on between,
And Red Cross ships with rows of green
And red lights moving to and fro.
If I return to sit and weave
TBpse tales, and watch the homefire burn,
When I return — if I return
Do you believe that they’ll believe?

The War-God’s Trembling Scales.
How much damage the Hun has inflicted
upon the Bear is apparently reserved for
later telling; but no possible doubt can
remain that the battering has been grievous.
The German may have expected to so com-
pletely cripple the Russian armies as to
make them negligible. It is possible that he
niay be disappointed at the military results
of his gigantic effort. But whatever may
be the truth on these points it is certain
tnat the Russian never expected to be so
emphatically pushed backwards, and that
the Czar’s measure of disappointment is
greater than the Kaiser’s. With German
battalions eating into Russian territory a
year after war commenced, it is ridiculous
to talk about the brilliant results of the
Grand Duke’s strategy, except in the nega-
tive sense that he has averted irretrievable
disaster. Meanwhile the situation in Galli-
poli is at the same old address, and there
is the usual succession of confusing yarns
about the Balkans and of Turkey being on
the verge of revolution and all that sort of
thing, most of which sounds suspiciously
like the stories of a year ago. The only
thing there is no question about is that a
desperate fight is going on from day to day,
3nd thousands of men are falling on either
side. Bulgaria continues looking for loot,
but uncertain how to get it; Greece is stand-
ing by in much the same frame of mind;
Koumania is gazing across her frontier with
i,ad eyes at the Russian retreat—all cowed
by dread and torn by doubt, and each mis-
trustful of the other. _ The Italian campaign
against Austria is still being waged among
the Alpine clouds; and from Belfort to
x pres the slaughter proceeds without serious
interruption. Further, as all hands are get-
ting top-boots and oilskins and furs ready
for the winter, the letting of blood can be
confidently looked forward to for many a day
Victory in the end is going to the side
which can keep on fighting when the other
iclJow is shaking at the knees; and that
is why every fit and free Australian must
either by personal election or by compulsion
get away to the place where things are
happening. If he does something else and
the Allies crumple up, then will there be no
real Australian home for him or his. The
is.sue is trembling in the balance as men-
acingly as it did when the first shot was
fared.
Adelaide s two leading schools are to com-
plete a “double” in the matter of new heads.
At Prince Alfred’s Chappie made way for
Bayley at Christmas, having held the post
close on 40 years, and being himself nearly
70.. Now St. Peter’s announces the coming
retirement of Cirdlestone, who is a much
younger man, and has been Head for the
comparative trifle of 22 years. Being an
Anglican canon, and still looking fit to stroke
the Oxford eight—as he twice did in the ’Bo’s
—he has been suspected of wanting to seek
preferment” in England; but he has
assured interviewers that such is not his
idea, and that, as for schools, St. Peter’s is
quite good enough for his only son.
“Incas”: So disgusted is Charles James
Kirkland, owner and editor of the Northern
Territory Times, with his treatment by the
Government officials that he is selling the
paper for little more than a song to a local
company. Kirkland was locked up by
Judge Bevan for contempt of court, and
although he was promptly redeemed by the
leading people of Darwin his incarceration
rankles. It is not often a prospectus gives
the real reasons for selling. Kirkland; how-
ever, is very frank about it
His chief reasons for wishing to leave the Terri-
tory are the serious ill-health of his wife, now in
England, and his unbelief in any sound or permanent
development of the resources of the country being
likely to result from present methods of adminis-
tration.
Whether the confession is calculated to help
Kirkland sell his shares is another matter.
The enlistment of “Bill” Denny, M.L.A.,
wifi remove one of the South Aus. Labor
Government’s keenest critics. He was
Attorney-General in the Verran (Labor)
Cabinet, and since he was omitted from the
Vaughan team he has made some sparkling
speeches in the House. His best effort was
on the family-party aspect. As a matter
of fact, the whole of the Labor members
met and named the Ministers, and all Craw-
ford Vaughan had to do, finding his brother
Jim and his brother-in-law Clarence Goode
included, was to fit them in where they could
do best work. Said Denny recently:—
The balance of convenience is entirely in favor of
handing over government to the members of one
family. Great public questions can best be solved
round one’s own fireside. Two brothers and a brother-
in-law in a Ministry of six, with a casting vote
for the Premier, must surely constitute a world’s
record. Every Labor supporter will send up a
fervent prayer:—
God bless the Premier and all his relations,
And keep us poor persons in our proper stations.
Denny is a lawyer, 42, and unmarried.

A musical burlesque which has been
tried and acquitted is generally understood
to be the mere bleeding remnants of what
its author originally produced. The nice
new script is torn to pieces in rehearsal
by stage staff and players; the mince is
then mined and bombed after-hours by
author, producer and stage manager in col-
laboration ; and finally the torn and teased
and sundered thing is stuffed into a new
sausage-skin by all hands, including the
musical director and the call boy. If the
finished entree “gets” the public it is re-
garded as holy, and other managements be-
gin to hunt about for replicas. In so far
as any one individual can be held respon-
sible for “Stop Your Nonsense,” served up
at Sydney Royal on Saturday, Beaumont
Smith, is rumored to be the guilty party.
He will. neither affirm nor deny; but, if he
is the sinner, he has struck the right mix-
ture first try and fully deserves his own
royalties. There is a plot swimming
through the thing, and it comes to the sur-
face at intervals to breathe; but it always
dives obligingly for a song, or an acrobatic
act or a ballet. The setting is plain and
original, the stage merely showing itself
as it is when the curtain isn’t up. Thus
the public is invited behind the scenes at
the Highty Flighty Theatre, where it stays
for the evening. This is economical from
the. management’s point of view and quite
satisfactory to a public which has been
hand-fed with gorgeous sets till it is jaded.
The show in front of the scenery is the
thing, and the “Stop Your Nonsense” co.,
which is mostly the “Glad Eye” co. trans-
posed, provides a really bright one.
* * * *
Ethel Dane gets a fair chance as Dolly
Gibbs, the rich, spoilt girl who runs away
into an almost busted theatrical co. in order
to escape from comedian Tom Shelford, the
rich young ass she doesn’t want to marry.
The pair meet in the theatre, and their
respective parents, one of whom is Frank
Bradley, pursue them in the insane manner
peculiar to musical comedy. They are at-
tended during the pursuit by two wowsers.
The first wowser is like Von Tirpitz, and
the other looks as if he had escaped from
the open monkey-cage at the new Zoo.
Henry Ford is the brisk manager of the
expiring co., which is saved by an unex-
pected inrush of rich amateurs; and
Edward Landor, as the singing property
man, trades some good, dry comedy. Harry
Sweeney (mechanist) is seen for once in
old clothes and a red nose, and makes a mild
success of it. Other extra people who be-

sonations (that of Daisy Jerome is capital),

the Leteens (comedy acrobats) earns honor-
able mention. The show deserves a good
run, and that’s what it appears to have
started on.

At Melbourne Majesty’s the loose ends
of “The Law of the Land” are flapping
out as obtrusively as ever. They flick the
mind’s eye with unabated force, and one
can’t ignore them. In point of fact, they
hurt. The first act excites a hope that the
private sec.’s quiet, birdlike admiration for
Mrs. Harding is going to blossom into a
rapturous scarlet flower, instead of which
it just wilts on the stalk arid makes no dif-
ference. Also the iceberg butler’s devotion
to the lady and his silent discovery of the
fact that either she or the sec. gave' Hard-
ing his quietus, may be fairly expected to
have some bearing on the plot. But nothing
comes of the cold butler’s intimate acquaint-
ance with the tragedy. He preserves his
low temperature to the finish, and he mat-
ters no more than the other accessory after
the crime. Nor does the crime itself really
matter, when all is said and done. The
objectionable Harding is dead, and there’s
an end of him. The drama is practically
purposeless after the first act. Three acts
of talk concerning his violent decease are
superfluous. The talk is as to whether any
trouble shall come of it; and no trouble
does come of it. The audience learns nothing
after the first act, save that the unseen wife
of a plump police inspector has produced

is dimly understood to be a wizard of Maori
extraction. There is a wealth of flags and
other decorative effects in the turn, and
taking one consideration with another it is
an acceptable plagiarism. Even the music,
which runs rather noisily along the whole
course, of the entertainment, is C. L. Soo’s
collection, of mock barbaric melodies! Syd-
ney Jarvis, the massive frivoller who wears
a belltopper and suggests an American
reminiscence of the late Rickards, is con-
tinuing his flirtations with Virginia Dare.
Also Kajiyama, the clever caligraphical
Jap, is still there. Likewise Mary Eliza-
beth and J. Britt. And Estelle Rose, the
partly unclad lady, has broken out with a
new idea. She runs Charlie Chaplin
competitions for wicked amateurs on

one at a. time, and the most in-
credibly foolish of these nameless strangers
will get a prize for his pains. Heaven knows
what the suffering audience will get for its
pains. The martyr’s crown, perhaps.

Long weeks ago there came a show to Sydney-by-the-
Sea,
It called itself “The Strollers,” and its swag was
full of glee,
And merriment, and novelty, and songandance and
“go.”
The folk who pack the Palace get good value for their
dough.
So, business being what it is, “The Strollers” are no
trampers;
They’ll have to black the old sign out and call
themselves “The Campers.”

local humorists have a prize competition
nightly as to who can be most funnily fatu-
ous in his style. Xndita’s snakes and Man-
deno’s dogs introduce a welcome. note of

“0.0.”: Speaking of the V.C., Trooper
Tom Morris, of the N.S.W. Lancers, was
the first of the “Colonial Contingent” to win
the bronze in the S’African trouble. He got
with it the added reward of £52 per annum
for life offered by an insurance company
to the Australian who got away with Cross
No. 1.
“Harrison O.” : Every bit as irritating as
the Yankee stage-hero’s worship of liis lady
is the lady’s tremendous respect for him if
he has a gift for business, robbery, etc. Vir-
ginia Stafford, in Broadhurst’s melodrama,
never tired of telling the Robert who.had
bought and paid for her that she learned to
love him because he was a millionaire with
his optics continually glued to the main
chance. Most star-spangled heroines measure
their admirers by the same golden rule.
Thus the leading maiden in “Potash and
Perlmiitter” for a time looks with favor on
a young musician, but at last decides that
she prefers the vulgar, middle-aged and igno-
rant Perlmiitter, because he is “a real man,
a business man” ! Yankee dramatists simply
can’t get rid of the obsession that the bish-
ness bloke is the noblest work of God. Even
when a U.S. playwright sets out ostensibly
to attack a money-king, as in “The Lion and
the Mouse,” he does it by emptying white-
wash over the “victim.” The whole tribe of
Amurkan stage-writers —whether their me-
dium is farce, tragedy, comedy or melodrama
—sing to the one Jew’s-harp in divers tones,
and the burden of their song is always that
kind hearts are less than dollar bills, and
simple faith than Yankee bluff.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“H. 0.”: I am beginning to suspect that
my remarks are not receiving the attention
they deserve in the United States. The
task of pointing out, courteously but firmly,
that it is no use trying to expand; a one-act
play into a three- or four-acter is making
me fatigued. This besetting vice of Yankee
dramatists is illustrated once again in “The
Law of the Uand.” We are introduced to
an unhappy married pair. The wife has a
lover; but the husband, who knows, refuses
to divorce her, since this is what she most
desires. There is also a child, of which the
tertium quid is father ; but so long as there
is no divorce, according to the law of the
land the youngster is the husband’s, and
lie tortures the wife by ill-treating the child.
The mother can do nothing without pro-
claiming the boy’s illegitimacy. The pro-
blem is interesting, but it is settled in the
first act by the lady putting a bullet in her
spouse. Artistically the play is over; but
it is not yet nine o’clock, so three acts, fol-
low, full of rude policemen, dark suspicions,
unnecessary bathos and long-drawn-out
cross-examinations. Then comes the cheap-
est of cheap endings-—the boss Jonathan
Hop decides, for sentimental reasons, not
to report the true facts of the murder, but
to trump up a ridiculous story about the
revolver going off on being dropped to the
floor. The usual U.S. record: one act of
fairly good stuff; three acts of tripe.

Died at Melbourne, at the age of 93, Mrs.
Ellen Akhurst, widow of William Mower
Akhurst, an early and almost-forgotten Aus-
tralian playwright. Akhurst wrote three
pantomimes—“ Jack Sheppard,” put on at the
old Haymarket; and “Robinson Crusoe” and
“Gulliver’s Travels,” seen at the Royal, all
of them full of topical, puns and
personalities. He was also responsible for
a burlesque, “The Siege of Troy,” and for
“King Arthur and the Round Table,” and an
adaptation of “Ixion.” In a bread-and-butter
way he was editor and dramatic critic of
Melbourne Herald, which in those days was
“Impartial, not neutral,” in the morning,
and charged 3d. for itself. About half a cen-
tury ago Akhurst returned to England
(whence he first came in 1849) as London
correspondent of the Age, and wrote several
extravarvnzas, including “Lady Godiva, for
Lord George Sanger, of mixed memory. He
put in some years in the Fog and died on the
way back to this country’s sunshine.
Barclay Gammon, the humorist who came
to Australia with the Maskelyne and Devant
magicians a few years ago, recently passed
out suddenly in London. A Mel. B. Spurr
type of joker, who had amassed much flesh
in a prosperous career, Barclay kept a piano
busy for a very long period. Dear old ladies
of both sexes particularly enjoyed his gusty
form of joking, and when he was in excep-
tionally good form the mirth of ancients
resounded loudly with every wheeze that
blew.
Australia’s recent antique visitor, Ellen
Terry, was, when the last mail left Eng-

comedian. A 1 H. it was who, when J. C.
Williamson first left the States for Aus-
tralia, took on the part of John Stofel m
the N’Yark production of “Struck Oil,
under the management of Augustus Pitou.
“J.F.H.” (from London) : Marie Lohr
has had but a brief career as the incredibly-
innocent young novice who mistook a hand-
some young German officer for St. Michael,
and in consequence brought a supposedly-
miraculous little stranger into the world.
Author Knoblauch struck a goldmine in
“Kismet”; this time he bottomed on a
shicer. The wonder is that such an ex-
perienced manager as Tree did not recognise
at a glance that the thing was a foredoomed
failure as an obvious outrage on all the pro-
babilities and the proprieties. Marie, by
the way, has been recalling that she made
her debut as a very small girl at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney, and scored her first
notable success at His Majesty’s, London.
Australia is busy writing its name all
over the English papers. It’s a long way
from war to chamber music; yet Australia
can cover the distance, Tommy Kangaroo
supporting one end and Percy Grainger the
other. Grainger’s Scandinavian Suite, for
’cello and piano, is just now the thing most
talked of by other-end musicians ; played at
a Steinway Hall concert it has lifted the
critics to the seventh heaven of ecstatic
drivel.
“0.K.”: A Cockney journalist says he is
“tickled when an officious old gentleman
bails up a street-corner Christy Minstrel
and asks him why he isn’t in khaki. The
open-air vocalist would be found to be almost
as old as his interrogator if his countenance
were uncorked.” Much the same might be
■ said of some of the youthful hero-actors at
whom satire points its thumb. Why don’t
they enlist? Why don’t their grhndsons
enlist?
One of the most discouraging signs of the
times in Britain is the continued popularity
of the revue —the degenerate entertainment
born of Tango and Turkey Trot and suckled
on ragtime. The only difference between
the latest and the earliest revues is that the
old gibes at soldiers are now left out.
Arthur Collins, the Drury Lane lessee, ran
a filly named Sweet Nell for the last Oaks
race in England. Her dam was the mare
that used to beat the favorite in “The
Whip,” after escaping death from dynamite
cn the railway journey to Newmarket.
“Norbell”: Ned Holloway made a digni-
fied, lieavy-father kind of stage-doorkeeper
in his old age, and he keenly resented the
free and easy style of a N’Yark stage-
manager who came with an imported Yankee
show. “Say, Rube,” said that potentate
one day, “you haven’t seen a wife of mine
around hyah this forenoon, have you?” The
majestic old Cerberus retorted acidily, “I
don’t know a single one of ’em by sight,
sir!”
From London: Forbes Robertson, most
graceful, refined, scholarly and dignified of
present-day English actors, is back, in
London after another tour of the U.S.A.
War conditions having so demoralised theat-
rical business in the northern hemisphere, the
Williamson people might resume those in-
terrupted negotiations with a more satisfac-
tory prospect. In his travels Forbes Robert-
son chiefly relies on “Hamlet,” “The Light
that Failed,” and “The Passing of the Third
Floor Back,” the last-named the biggest divi-
dend-payer on the list.
“Ho Ho”: The English language is rarely
heard in Australian playhouses now. At
time of writing Melbourne’s three principal
show-places are offering star-spangled fare.
At the Royal Yankee-Yiddishers are perpe-
trating “Potash and Perlmutter”; an
Amurkan bellowdrama, “The Law of the
Land,” with Amurkan stars, _is at Her
Majesty’s; while the Tivoli’s billtoppers are
“America’s most famous singing comedian,”
“the New York beauty,” and two Yankee
“comediennes.” And it isn’t as though the
stuff was good. Uncle Sam’s melodrama is
crude, his comedy dismal, and the syncopated
inanities of his vaudevillains are worst of
all.
“M.P.A.”: John Bunny, the rotund mov-
ing-picture comedian, who died recently, was
only stopped from appearing in Australia
with a comedy company by the big fire
which destroyed Her Majesty’s (Sydney)
and wiped out “Ben Hur.” Bunny
was engaged and 'ready to sail, but the co. s
contract was cancelled. In 1912 I met
Bunny in Ireland, where he was engaged on
a number of Irish film plays . which have
since been screened in Australia. It was
during the same year that he played in a
number of Dickens’s stories. Though he
was a Yankee and a comedian, he was one
of the most unobtrusive men I ever drank a
whisky with.
“De Oriel” : In a Queensland cow centre
the side-showman had failed to induce the
crowd of cockies standing around to walk in
and see the Armless Wonder. “Roll up,
roll up,” he cried, “and see the marvel ot
the age. He does everything with his toes;
cleans his teeth, lights his cigarette, shoots a
gun off, writes letters.” No response. Then
the showman had an inspiration. During
his performance,” he bawled, “the Armless
Wonder will explain how he milks a cow with
his toes!” He nearly went down before the
rush.
“Stargazer” : They say “The Law of the
Land” has run for over two years in New
York. Should it run for 30 it will remain
an execrable play. If the drama ended when
it finishes, at about nine o’clock, it would
be a good; useful one-acter for a pro. with
a turn for passionate attitudes. But the
last three acts are wholly inexcusable, and
the elucidation is so weak that it scarcely
needs a touch to convert it into farce. It
an Australian playwright were to offer such
a drama to one of our intelligent and discrim-
inating theatrical managers, he would be
told with scorn to go to the American experts
and study how"to make a play.
Bernard Shaw’s “Major Barbara,” with
its Kaiserian philosophy re the value ot
cannon in Providence’s scheme of civilisa-
tion, might have had a booming revival it
liis vvritings on the war had not snuffed him
out for the present. The witty moralist is
left without a spark of popularity on his
candle-wick. As long as he drew false con-
elusions from plain facts Shaw was funny ,
but when he raised plain matter-of-fact argu-
ments about the war from false premises, his
old admirers drove him out into the wilder-
ness to bay at the moon.
“D.” : To my thinking the best-acted part
in “The Law of the Land” is that of the
misbegotten child, played by little Kathleen
Lindgren. This youngster acts with the
naturalness of a small girl playing school
in her own backyard, and that is a quality
few elder artists are ever able to . strike,
although they are continually striving, to
work back to it. The trouble with a kiddy
placed upon the stage is that it almost in-
stantaneously adopts the artificiality of its
elders. This will be the undoing of little
Kathleen Lindgren, if she is not watched.
The best policy to adopt would be to have
the elder pros, go to school to her, lest she
should go to school to them.
“ J.F.H.” : The Irish Players of the Abbey
Theatre, Dublin, are reported to be booked
for an early Australian tour. Look out for
ructions. When they presented Synge’s
“Playboy of the Western World” in the
States, they were bombarded with everything
throwable from the pit and gallery. Some
Irishmen still consider the piece slander
upon the daughters of Erin, though most of
the London dramatic critics, especially
Walkley, of The Times, are enthusiastic
about it. At latest the Players were at
London Coliseum raising roars of laughter at
the expense of the “foorcc” in a new and
merry farce called “Duty.”

THE SONGS WE SING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When earth’s as full of music gay
As we are full of other things,
The festive soul throws care away,
And songs in lilting measure sings.
The echo every chorus wakes
Of great, full-blooded sentiment;
Then no old grief or sorrow breaks
The joy of present-time content.
A mighty stage, the world belongs
To us (the bar is anything) —
We are the heroes of the songs
That all the world has made to sing!
We live beyond prosaic days,
And pirates bold or knights are we,
Or lovers ardent in the praise
Of ladies we shall never see.
How swiftly can the hours then pass,
How easily can Care be slain,
While yet the amber-flooded glass,
Though emptied, still is full again!
As heroes through the world we drift —
Not slaves of dull, drab circumstance.
Still let the chorused song uplift
Our hearts with throbs of high romance!
To-night the lights of joyance shine,
The merry hour so lightly goes;
The friendly notes of “Auld Lang Syne”
Shall linger with us in repose; v.
X.S.W.
HAMER.
Though butter still is hard to get,
The jam supplies remain,
And actors we have lately met
Are looking glad again.

Jimmie Pannikin”—in office hours Don-
ald Fraser, Inspector of State Schools in
IN. S. Wales —keeps on his hunt for the
scalp of the dairy-farm child-slaver. The
other evening at Granville he urged a public
meeting to consider this form of slavery as
one of the curses of Australia. Quoting
instances (concerning which he challenged
refutation on any platform), he mentioned
a North Coast farmer who admitted that
one of his children, six years old, usually
milked eight or nine cows in the morning
before starting for school four miles away •
another, a girl of five, milked from three to
five; her brother, two years older, drained
seven to 10. The jovial father told “Pan-
nikin” that the infants did this “for pas-
time ’ and “enjoyed the fun!” It was a lie,
of course; but even supposing it wasn’t?
Like every school teacher with experience
among the cows, Inspector Fraser knows
the wicked effects on small minds and
bodies of that sort of “pastime” ; and, as a
humanitarian and patriotic Australian, the
longer he serves the more he is convinced
that the cancer of this child-slavery must
be cut out of the Commonwealth.
From the Argus of April 1, 1920:
The annual report of the Federal Statistician on
Social Conditions shows that seven marriages took
place during the past 12 months in Westralia, 14
in S. Australia, six in Victoria and Tasmania, 12 in
Bananaland, and one in N. S. Wales. The divorces
numbered 7362, of which 7360 were granted by
Justice Gordon at Sydney, and two at Melbourne by
Chief Justice Madden. In making orders nisi Judge
Madden declared that he was astounded at the
prevalence of infidelity in Victoria, the main cause
of these unhappy manages being the reckless
manner in which women entered into matrimonial
alliances with mere boys.
The Statistician’s survey reveals that the average
age of bridegrooms during the year was 19, and of
the brides 46. One of the bridegrooms, aged 20,
had been twice married before. The marriage
solemnised in N. S. Wales was between a man of 18
ar.d a woman of 57. It is anticipated in thie
report that after seven years have elapsed marriages
will become more frequent and the disproportion
between the ages of the contracting parties be less
marked, there being a good crop of boys coming
forward.
Nevertheless, the position is somewhat delicate,
the proportion of unmarried males of marriageable
age to females being as one to 420. Mr. Knibbs
again insists that to get the best results and assure
social happiness, the regulations framed by the
Government for the protection of young males
should be amended in several directions. The fre-
quent abduction of young men is a grave reflection
upon the female police, and Mr. Knibbs strongly
recommends that these officers should be relieved
of responsibility in this direction and the work
handed over to the militia. Last week the only
son of Mr. and Mrs. I. Mcßildad was carried off
while returning from work, and all attempts to trace
him have failed. The Superintendent of Police ex-
pects that as in other cases the missing young man
is being carefully looked after, and will return to
the city later on with a wife and family.
Disgraceful scenes have taken place lately in the
suburban districts, where fierce jealousy has been
caused in almost every street by unmarried women
leaving the precincts of their own homes and invad-
ing other thoroughfares. This breach of regulations
has resulted in frequent discreditable fights. More-
over, young men are terrified to venture abroad, and
clergymen who have attempted to shield them from
invitations to tennis and harbor picnics have been
openly jeered at. The lot of the couples married in
recent years is also most unfortunate, since organ-
ised efforts appear to be made to estrange the hus-
band from his wife. One man employed in the
Museum, whose wife has been compelled to visit her
relatives in the country, had to apply to the police
last week for protection against surprise parties
which had flocked to his residence at all hours of
the night. He has been temporarily housed, as a
matter of precaution, at one of the torpedo-launching
stations.

of Russell Clarke, M.L.C., of Sunbury, who
also owns the outlaw’s rifle. The plough-
iron overcoat had been given to the late
M. J. Clarke by a police superintendent of

covered in the vaults of the Victorian Trea-

Artist Ted Colles writes from Some-
where :—•
He belongs to the Light Horse, and is about the
youngest man of colonel’s rank serving with the
Australians. He is calm and dignified, never known
to unbend even to an intrusive mob of vulgar sniper’s
bullets. He it was who introduced to his men
the plan of wearing a tiny sulphur-satchel hung about
the neck to discourage the company of certain
grey vermin. The other morning he slipped out
from his dug-out and down to the beach for a swim.
He was paddling around, with the water dripping
off the points of his small, fierce moustache, and the
inevitable sulphur-bag about his neck, when Bill and
Jim, of the Infantry, who were floundering about
near-by, spotted him. They hadn’t been initiated
in the niceties of the sulphur-bag toilet. Standing
waist-deep in the water, with his fists on his hips,
Bill studied the phenomenon for a moment. Then he
turned to Jim: “Wot th’ ’ell’s that ’e’s wearin’,
Jim?” Jimmo was plodding along at the breast-
stroke, but found time between spurts of water to
turn a glance on his Majesty’s officer. “’Ullo, Joe!”
he cried. “That yer life-buoy ye’re wearin’
round yer neck?” The Light Horse officer made no
comment. But someone has suggested that com-
missioned officers should have their stars and crowns
tattooed on their shoulders, to preclude the possi-
bility of strange privates acting under misappre-
hensions in certain circumstances.

“Copperkins” : A stroke of that genius
which distinguishes Victorian police man-
agement has been achieved in Melbourne.
Its purport is to save a penny in the delivery
of every police letter, as well as all and
sundry, be the same more or less, to, from,
or about any place within, the meaning of
the Act. Even up to the time he was made
a J.P., O’Callaghan, the former Vic. police
commissioner, never did anything so wonder-
ful as this. Let A. G. Sainsbury, therefore,
have the full credit of it. To avoid paying
postage on police correspondence, constables
are being used, like runners in the dak mail
system of Hindustan, to pass letters from
hand to hand until they reach their destina-
tion. If the sergeant at Preston wants to
write to headquarters, he hands the des-
patch to a cop who lumbers with it to the
edge of his. beat and there hands it to the
next adjoining John, who in turn passes it
on. Thus, filtering through suburb after
suburb, it reaches town. But plainly the
links in the chain have to be coincidental
and contemporaneous, so to speak, otherwise
they have to loiter long at the extreme edge
of their beats before the John in the next
district makes contact and relieves them of
their large blue envelopes. The new sys-
tem, apart from the economy involved, is
understood to be Sainsbury’s answer to recent
complaints that the police system of Vic-
toria is quite unreliable. “Unreliable?” he
says. “Why, we trust our men to carry
our own messages.” Up against that, the
carper, of course, falls down dead.
The man on the land has quaint ideas
about finance most times. The other day
Hamilton (Vic.) Water Trust, having £7OO
for investment, was invited by one of its
members to take up Commonwealth war
stock; but by five votes to three the parish-
pump party decided to “keep the money in
the town,” and handed it to the local branch
of a Melbourne bank! It was a somewhat
unfortunate bank, too, in the stressful days
of old.

“Carfax” : Just to change the subject for
a moment. Is it anybody’s business to see
that I do not carry round a pocketful of
tetanus, scabies, boils on the neck, measles
and hydatids? If it is, this person was a
shirker yesterday, because he omitted to
have me placed under arrest and a hot
shower-bath. I attended a recruiting meet-
ing, visited numerous pubs, had afternoon
tea at a fashionable place of cackle, went to
a theatre (and more pub) and rode in
several tram-cars with all these pleasant-
nesses wrapped up in a little roll. The par-
cel was. on several occasions so close to the
Australian Girl that I did the unusual thing
and shrank back from her—and she was
much below the age of 78. If Muriel (or
it may be Angelina) contracts cerebro-spinal
meningitis during the week I am going to
feel pretty mean about it, and will send to
the newspapers asking whether it is true
these things are better managed in Ger-
many. The Argus is sure to know and may
write a leading article concerning the callous
indifference shown to the travelling public by
a Government composed of people like Billy
Hughes. But that is just where the Argus
may tall in its habitual hole, because the
culprit is Private Enterprise, who in an
imported drapers’ emporium handed out the
nuclei of the abominations herein referred
to three filthy, greasy, unwashed, dis-
hevelled P ie ces of paper, issued bright and
new by the Australian Government, and re-
issued and re-issued by a bank that has just
paid a very fat dividend. The awful things

How is a poor bloke’s fancy to fit
The giddy whirl of the days that run
Neck and neck with the days long dead?
Lord, ain’t the tallest skirt a peach?
Look at the way she carries her head !
Would she come, I wonder, to Bondi Beach?

“Full Astern”: One day last week a pas-
senger steamer which hauls through the
entrance to Port Jackson two or three times
a week, and whose every barnacle is known
to the Defence examiners at the Heads, was
“passed” by them and steamed up to her
berth. An hour later she came churning
along outward-bound; but this time the skip-
per, thinking perhaps that as the canoe was
O.K. an hour earlier there was no need to
go through the usual formalities again,
carried on for the open sea. He had just
cleared the Heads when a nine-inch reminder
plunged under the ship’s bows. Land-lubbers
aboard threw handsprings on the deck, ana
the “old man” and chief engineer cursed
volubly through their bristling whiskers as
they put the brakes on. Then the examiners
did their act, said everything was 0.1v.j and
that the’vessel could go about its usual busi-
ness. One of these days a too precipitous
custodian of our shores will sink a careless
coaster whose skipper neglects on the lUUbtn
time of passing to ask leave to go to sea 01

“Mujik” at an impromptu recruiting
meeting:—
The maid hopped blithely into the tram, and the
seats being all occupied seized a strap with steady
hand. Percy Oleanblot lifted himself to his feet.
“Please sit there,” he murmured with a propiti-
atory smile. “No, no,” said the girl quickly. “Sit
down —do, you look so ill.” As she went to push
him back the car stopped abruptly. Percy, having
no support, collapsed upon the knees of Ex-
pansion, and thence slid back into his seat. Poor
fellow,” said the maid, bending over towards the
outraged matron. “I knew that he was not strong
enough to stand. All the robust men are going to
the Front.” Everyone inspected Percy, now con-
cealed behind a vacuous grin of mortification. Mia.
Expansion looked him over with placid deliberation.
“ ’E looks orlite ter me,” she declared in a tone
of high-bred disdain. “Not at ali,” replied the
maiden, leaning across to the full length of her
fine arm. “Curvature of the spine, I am sure,’ she
whispered loudly—“or measles.” Percy glared horri-
bly out of the door; two or three persons started
talking about the insufferable insolence of young
bounders who refuse to go and fight. A quiet old
man in the corner started to say something about
conscription. But just then the car stopped again,
and Percy walked.

On his birthday—August 10—Captain Eric
Harrison, chief instructor at the Point Cook
(Yic.) Aviation School, concluded a J -
mile-an-hour volplane to earth . and shook
hands with the Director of Military Opera-
tions, in sign of the accomplishment of the
first flight of the first aeroplane _ built in
Australia. From elevator to tail-skid it
had been made under Harrison’s eye. It is
for tuition purposes, and can coyer 40 miles
an hour. “It banks well, is light on the
controls, keeps a true course, and climbs
excellently,” says Harrison. Spruce, ash,
blackwood and walnut are the bones of it,
and tests are being made to ascertain whether
construction of Australian woods throughout
is not possible. An Australian-made engine

should shortly replace that now in use.
There are 13 pupils at the aviation school-
four of them in the advanced class. These
four will probably take wing shortly in
Mesopotamia, where the reputation of the
Garden of Eden is being besmirched by the
Turk. It was here, by the way, that young
G. P. Merz, of Ballarat, doctor and aviator,
lost his life in action at the end of last
month. The ruins of his biplane were
found on the desert sands.

maritime friend tells me that the warships
operating in and around Dahomey (or it may
be Farrell’s Flat) are all painted like

painted on her steel nose, which makes her
appear to be always steaming at full speed.
It is (a, delightfully mad idea; but it gives
transport skippers the cold shivers if they

“De Oriel”: Let me help to curse the
slothfulness of the British War Office. Four
years ago a Tasmanian friend perfected a
new modified armor-plate,
remarkably light and tliin,
and submitted the invention
to the War Office. There
apparently being nothing
doing in that direction, the
Australian Defence authori-
ties were induced to make
a test. A rifle squad fired
upon the plates, which
though surprisingly thin,
escaped penetration. Official
correspondence proves the
trial to have been highly
satisfactory. After another
long delay the Imperial
authorities agreed to a
“master-test” by big-gun
fire, the plates to be used as
armor case upon a hulk;
but here a deadlock ensued,
as neither party would pay
the cost. In between waits
the discoverer passed away,
and with him perished very much
that it was, desirable to know in connection
with the invention.

It was Oscar Wilde who, standing on the
deck of a steamer bound for America,
whither he was going to lecture on lhe
Home Beautiful,” said: “I go to take Cul-
ture to a Continent.” And it was the Kaiser
who, addressing his Prussian Guards in Ber-
lin, said: “You go to take Kultur to the
World.” The difference between Oscar and
the Kaiser is mainly a matter of time. The
one is already dead and d—d. The other is
thusfar only d —d.
“Y.Z.”: It is high time some system was
set up to curtail the demand on Brown’s
small change and the petty cash of Mr.
Smith. Apparently any “patriot” can make
a public nuisance of himself, wallowing and
floundering around with the hat, questing
donations for' his cause in
the name of the war and
righteousness and loyalty.
Probably the most irritating
guerilla tax-gatherer just
now (in Melbourne at any
rate) is the busybody who
wants money for badges for
the unfit. The Government
is against him, the rejects
are against him; but he
continues burrowing for
doles. His rabid attack has
given rise to other plagues
that want badges for young
married men who have so
many dependent upon them
that they cannot go shoot-
ing Turks no matter how
they ache to, badges for
would-be heroes detained bv
official duties, and badges for
citizen officers held back
from the field of glory by
chains of red tape. Pre-
sently there will be an urgent need
for special badges for flat feet, soapy
heels, ingrowing toenails, bunions,
writers’ cramp and inefficient or defi-
cient teeth. There’s no end to the pos-
sibilities unless the Government puts
a stopper on all unlicensed, hare-
brained collectors. Where so much
money is wanted for so many _ good
purposes, the pestering self-glorifying
fadmonger is more than an individual
infliction. He is a public mis-
fortune.
Attorney-General Hughes was last week
roughly handled and narrowly escaped arrest
in Melbourne for interfering on behalf of a
little boy, who, he says, was being brutally
treated by a policeman. If Hughes were
not the Attorney-General the subsequent pro-
ceedings would run like this:
Clerk: Samson Goliath, you are charged with
being drunk and disorderly and assaulting Constable
David in the execution of his duty. How do you
plead ?
Prisoner: Eh?
Beak (to police inspector) : Is this man sober ?
Inspector: Yes, your Worship. Shamming lunacy
and deafness.
Beak: Ah 1 Old offender, I suppose. Explain the
charge.
A constable whispers three words to the prisoner,
who shakes his head. “Denies the charge, your
Worship.”
Constable David: While proceeding along my beat
at 6.35 J last night the accused, who had been fight-
ing with some of his companions near a hotel, sud-
denly attacked me. I had great difficulty in arrest-
ing him, and had it not been for the prompt arrival
of Constable Jack Johnson, who drew his baton, I
would have been even more severely maltreated.
Accused kicked and struck me repeatedly, tore my
coat (coat exhibited) and incited the bystanders to
join him.
Constable Johnson gives corroborative evidence.
Beak: Have you anything to say, Goliath, for this
outrageous behavior ?
Prisoner: Eh?
Orderly repeats the question loudly into the
accused’s ear.
Prisoner: Your Worship, I saw the constable
strike a little boy—(laughter from 17 policemen)—
and on going to protest—(more merriment) —was
violently thrown down —(shrieks of laughter) —and
my memory i 5....
Beak: Yes, yes, of course. You were the victim
of a most scandalous assault. (More laughs.) People
like you always are. (Grins.) Have you any wit-
nesses ?
Prisoner: Eh?
Attendant roars: Have you any witnesses?
Prisoner: The little boy is— —-
Inspector: No witnesses, your Worship.
Beak: How did he get all that blood on his head
and the skin torn off his face?
Policeman David: Fighting, sir. He has been at
it for days.
Beak: Goliath, you have added lying to your
other numerous offences. Fined ss. for drunken-
ness; 40s. or a week for assaulting the police; order
made that you defray the cost of a new coat for
the constable. You will also be detained for medical
treatment.
Prisoner: Eh ?
Beak: Be careful! Call the next case.

“William Blank”: We are trying not to be
puffed up about it; yet I suppose that in all
the ages there never was a family which cov-
ered itself with so much glory as ours has

vent the possibility of an attack from the rear. ——
and he took with him. Suddenly —— called
out to ——• that he had seen someone moving on
the second embankment, whereupon ——- fired point-

On this story being related to Major-General

would go down in history for all time.

P.ill Denny, Labor member for Adelaide,
was Attorney-General in the Verran
Ministry in 1910-12, has gone into camp.
Denny is 43, and the first man of the South
Aus. Assembly to enlist. He is the only
lawyer on the Ministerial side of the House.
Dave Gordon, ex-journalist and ex-Federal
member for Boothby, now a Legislative
Councillor, has jiLso offered his services. But
as he is over 50 —he has two sous in the
fighting line and a daughter a military
nurse—the State Commandant has merely
put his name on the list of those who are
to be called on when wanted. Denny set an
example in two ways. Said lie: “I 'received
invitations to address recruiting meetings,
but I would rather face the Turks myself
than ask a man to go.”
L. P. Crawfurd, who was domestic chap-
lain and gentleman help to Bishop Harmer
at Adelaide 15 years ago, has pust been
measured for an apron as Bishop of Staf-
ford —a sort of curate-bishopric in the dio-
cese of Lichfield (Eng.). In the curious
way in which the English Church manages
these things, there is no screAV attached
to the Stafford bishopric, but the pay is
provided from the revenues of a canonrv
at Lichfield Cathedral, to which Crawfurd
has also been appointed. His former boss
at Adelaide, Harmer, has been bishing com-
fortably for years past at Rochester (Eng.),
having heard a call to accept that roost
on a salary five times greater than he re-
ceived at Adelaide, plus a seat in the Lords.
“A ic”: Bishop Green, of Ballarat, this
week said So-long to his sheep, and gave two
incidental digs at other shepherds'. First,
he insisted that for great and rough dio-
ceses the bishop ought to be in the prime
of life, and should step out of the job when
the grasshopper became a burden. Secondly,
why must the retired bishop go to England?
Australia was a better place to live in than
England. Therefore, although English-
born, he meant to settle near Melbourne.
Green really offers a plea against any more
archbishops, bishops, or occupants of fat
vicarages, like St Colomb’s, Hawthorn, or
All Saints , St. Ivilda, being imported from
England. Suppose that Chief Justices and
Judges were imported, what encouragement
tor the Bar\\ liat kind of men would study
for it;
It would be interesting to know whether
the “triumphal entry” of the Kaiser’s wife
and the Crown Prince’s wife into Warsaw
really was intended. If it was, what kind
ot a pair of royal hounds must their hus-
bands be to have bid them do such a thing
under such conditions?
“Chasuble” : Pied this week, at Melbourne,
Mrs. Martha Webster, ex-banker 11. G,
Turner’s sister. She arrived in 1870,
intending merely to be a visitor, but accepted
an invitation to become Unitarian pastoress
and held that fort till 1883. Born in Lon-
don in 1839, and educated at Dijon, France,
she married John Webster in 1879. In the
pulpit she was rather literary than eloquent.
Their friendship brought another woman
pretty _ often into this pulpit—the late
Catherine Helen Spence, of Adelaide. But
in S. Australia Miss Spence, matchless
among local women politicians, was as a
preacher not on the same rung of the ladder
as Mrs. Lake, the persuasive wife of one of
the ministers of Chief Justice Way’s little
Bible Christian sect.
Australian Methodism, which has been
celebrating the arrival of the first clergy-
man from Britain by the ship Hebe on Aug-
ust 10, lSlo, had as its pioneer in Sydney
a convict who had been sentenced to death
in, England for forgery, but had been re-
prieved. A Methodist chaplain there so
wrought on his mind that when ho landed
with the gang he formed a little Methodist
class. Leigh, the first parson, found 19
adherents to start with. The convict
founder had been helped by a Methodist
schoolmaster, imported by Marsden. They
sent a memorial to England, asking for a
clergyman; and Leigh came. The convict
transports had Church of England clergy
as chaplains. These usually settled in Syd-
ney, where they formed a phalanx deter-
mined to keep the colony Anglican. Hence
Leigh had some difficulty in getting a license
from the Governor, who wanted to solace
him with a far better billet; but he hung
out, and soon got what he wanted, though
he was two years achieving a “chapel” of
his own. The first Australian-born Metho-
dist clergyman, by the way, was “Father”
VVatsford, who arrived at Parramatta in
Before the war started there was a strong
probability that King Cole would have a
Book Arcade in London, too. Henniker
Heaton discussed the matter with the Mel-
bourne manager of the old monarch’s
music department, who was then in
London buying. When he put the
question of the needful, Heaton re-
plied that money was available at call.
Tons of it would bo provided by
Carnegie, the free-library man—-the million-
aire who was going to pave the way to the
millennium with books. Negotiations were
begun : Cole’s were to stock the Arcade and
imd the staff, and Carnegie was to draw the
cheque. Then the war broke out, and
Henniker Heaton died, and the advts. said
the millennium was unavoidably postponed.

Dead at Penola (S.A.), L. W. Teake, one
of the best-known residents of the
State’s south-east. He was at Geelong in the
early ’7o’s, and was associated with
Graham Berry and other prominent Vic-
torians of the time; then he crossed the
border, and for nearly 40 years has been
chairman or secretary of nearly everything
in the Penola district. A. 11. Peake, the
ex-Premier, is a brother.
“B.”: The death at Ilandwick (Sydney)
the other day of his aged widow revives
memories of Judge Callasrhan, one of the
ablest and most unconventional lawyers of
hi;-- time. “Callaghan’s Acts” was for years
a standard in N. S. Wales, but the per-
sonal. peculiarities of the man w T ho did the
compilation are best remembered. He once
secured the trial of a man merely for the
purpose of obtaining an acquittal, and when
the jury returned a verdict of guilty Cal-
laghan narrowly escaped falling down dead.
In order to get the man out he had to con-
vince the Premier and Governor that he
had induced the Attorney-General to file an
indictment, and that it was the stupidity
of the jury which caused the scheme to
break down. Once when Chairman of
Quarter Sessions he had a case in which
Father Therry, of Goulburn, accused a
stockman of cattle-stealing. Dailey de-
fended, but as there was practically no
defence Callaghan confined himself to the
shortest summing-up on record: “Gentlemen.
I Dave the case to you.” The verdict was
“Guilty!” While on circuit , allaghan
always declined to sleep in a pub bed and
insisted upon camping for the niarht on a
billiard-table or some similar clear space.
An odd manner of doing quite commonplace
things and of expressing matter-of-fact ideas
gave him wide reputation as a humorist.

she is principal contralto at the Collin's-

poultry and bee keeping, fruit growing,
dairying, stock breeding, veterinary surgery

least of all. Women do the work and men

the STRICKEN 7 HERO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s scarcely a man in camp who hasn’t nnt
ore knees, and small wonder. \Ve were Z vn on
them for about nine hours yesterday
Letter from Gallipoli.
To battle for my country’s cause
I faced the heathen foe;
The ills of war that do not pause
1 intimately know;
I suffered in the sodden trench,
I felt the pain, endured the stench.
My courage, if it must be said,
The Colonel wrote was “fine” ;
T'c counted up the rows of dead ’
Peculiarly mine,
And eighty Teuton dead and Turk
I thought a measly morning's work.
Tpon our knees their hills we stormed,
AVe crawled in wormy strings,
t rom upright humans all transformed
Jo grimy creeping things.
Of war our fellows know a bit—
A ou bet they re getting down to it!
T thought I’d win the Cross, perhaps,
Or noble scars to show,
And now I’m down with thirty chaps—
Our beds are all a-row.
Heroic credit’s not for me—
Disqualified with housemaid's knee!
VICTORIA.

First the State started making advances to
farmers, and then it decided that farmers
were not the only pebbles with votes to give
away at general elections. So “workers”
were included in the scheme, Parliament
authorising what is now the State
Advances Office to borrow £750,000 a year
and lend it, “for the purpose of purchasing
or erecting a dwelling, to any person em-
ployed in manual or clerical work who is
200o in receipt of an income of more than
±-00 per annum, and is not the owner of
any land other than the allotment on which
it is proposed to build.” The maximum ad-
vance is x 450, and the building alone must
be worth as much as the advance made. The
Office then takes a mortgage over land and
building, and the borrower (who has been
helped with free plans and specifications if
lie has asked for them) starts paying off
the principal. The maximum term of the
loan depends on the character of the secu-
rity. The most this benevolent Government
"ill do ior you is 364 years. The interest
on the unpaid balance is 44 p.c.—or was at
the date of The Bulletin’s last informa-
tion ; though how the Office is sroing to lend
at 44 p.c. when the British Government
can t borrow at 44 p.c. without offering con-
cessions this paper doesn’t know.
As a matter of fact, most of the alleged
profits which this branch of the State Ad-
vances Office has made are bogus profits.
Last year, for example, there was supposed
to be a profit of £9247 ; but £5742 of it went
towards the extinction of a bogus asset—
“ Loan Charges Account.” The Office bor-
rows the money at a low rate of interest,
and therefore _ doesn’t raise it at par. In
other words, it pretends to get the money
at. (say) 34 p.c.; but instead of getting £lOO
it actually gets only £97, though it has to
pay £lOO when the loan falls due. The £3
which it doesn’t get but which it has to pay
at the finish is really deferred interest; and
the contribution towards the extinction of
this debt is as proper a charge against the
revenue as the interest itself is. The only
question is whether the £8742 written off
last year was a fair contribution towards
the. total, which still amounts to £52,000.
It it was, then the actual profit last year
was a wretched little £505. That is to say,
£505 was all the business provided last year
towards meeting contingencies connected
with property loans amounting to about 24
millions. Nor were past years much better.
The total reserves are therefore wholly in-
adequate. Which is another way of saying
that the State lias been undertaking to do
for these people more than it can afford to
do.

If this co. doesn’t carry a vote of thanks
to Bill of Berlin and present him with an
extra pair of pants free there is no gratitude
in it. Of course Australia pays. For years
and years past the co. has been ground
between the upper and the nether stones—
between high wage and low tariff. It
couldn’t charge what the high wages and
other industrial conditions warranted, be-
cause the foreign goods would then under-
sell the local goods. Now, however, there
is no foreign seller, and the local man
charges pretty well what he pleases. So
the profit disclosed for the year is more than
km 11 ms much as the net profit for the pre-
ceding 10 years, and the amount paid in
dividend is equal to the aggregate of the
dividends paid in the preceding 12 years.
1 hat is to say, the dividend for the past
year was 10 p.c., and the average dividend
fnr the preceding 12 years was five-sixths
of 1 p.c. p.a.
No doubt the country will do a serious
think after this. Here is an industry which
is practically indispensable to the success
° J . 19 Empire in this life-and-death struggle,
nothing and blankets are almost as neces-
sary to victory as munitions. Yet this
country has permitted this factory, on which
it now has to depend for its life, to eke
out a most miserable existence. It per-
mitted it to be so harassed by foreigners
that the directors had a while ago to write
oil: half the shareholders’ capital as lost;
and even after that capital had been written
ott the co. was five years before it could pay
a dividend. If a country can turn for help
to an industry which it has treated like that
and do it without blushing, it must have a
crocodile’s hide. But the important ques-
tion is, What is going to happen in the
future i Is an industry which is so indis-
pensable to be allowed to be choked? If
not, then up must go the tariff; and justice
won t be done until the co., besides paying
a reasonable dividend, puts aside enough
Proht to restore the written-off capital.
Meantime, in order partly to increase its
plant, the directors are grabbing the pre-
sent burst of prosperity to issue the 28,321
unsold 10s. shares. This should bring in
enough not only to pay for the plant on
order, but also to wipe out the debt of £6210
to the bank. Beyond that there are now
only a few small trade liabilities.

In the published balance-sheet goodwill still
stands for £41,983 of the capital; but, after
paying the present dividend, there are re-
serves and unappropriated profits totalling
within £1461 of that amount. In other
words, all but £1461 of the capital is now
represented by tangible assets. Nominally
m its five years of life the co. (which was
a ? r °FoA e^o y - concein before that) lias
made to o,>-68 in excess of the dividend. That
is to say it has made an almost exact 9 p.c.
per annum, of which 6 p.c. has been divided
and the rest kept in the business. But
that is putting the best face on things. Bor
there is this also to consider. The co has
a lot of its share capital in freeholds and
stores in Sydney and Brisbane. These pro-
S£^ Sta i M li! n tlle books at £152,146. About
±<o,ooo of that money has been spent in
the last five years; and it is very doubtful
whether premises erected during that period
can be fairly reckoned worth 20s. for every
£ they have cost. If so, some of the profit
will yet have to be written off to counter-
balance the fictitious price paid for these
real-property assets.
In addition to the £205,755 of share
capital there is £130,602 of the public’s
money in the business—overdrafts, accounts
Vi K ® r etc ‘ tbe ot ber side there is
£loi,lBB represented by stock mortgages,
liens and. other advances. These items
naturally increased during the past year
of war and drought; but they had also
been growing in years when there was far
In 1911 the total was
£102,615; in 1913, £147,739. More Aus-
tralian cos. in this line of business have got
into trouble through being drawn into these
advances than from any other cause. Every
penny of Winchcombe, Carson’s lot may be
good. On the other hand, there is room
tor a good many pennies that are very bad.
As to the future, there is no reason to
expect that the current year will be a very
profitable one. The drought will reduce the
offerings of wool and station produce and
stock, and therefore the commission earn-
ings; and the general disturbance of trade
wih add to the expenses, as it did during
the past year. Further, sales of pastoral
holdings are not likely to bring in manv fat
commissions. But Australia recovers
quickly; and the co. has an equipment to
handle the vastly larger trade which should
b- available in (say) three years’ time.

This is one of the cos. which still refrain
from telling, among other things, the value
o- the trust estates in hand. One therefore
can t even guess at the progress it is making
in that respect. If this co. had £2.000.000
Ox estates under administration 10 years ago
and has £3,000.000 worth now, it would be
h fair thing to conclude that for the next
10 years it would show earnings in excess
of those of the past 10 years. All we can
say, without such data, is that the co. has
a wonderfully good 10 years behind it. Look
at this:—
. June,’os. June,’ls.
Liquid assets .. £17,951 £39,284
Other assets .. 24,461 31.575
Liabilities . . 524 \j]
Of the present “other assets” about one half
consists of book debts and the other half of
office premises. So in 10 years the co
while paying very fat dividends, has piled
l-rvm® l^ 1,000 ! ° f hai ' d Cash and over
£<ooo of as-good-as-cash; and its share
capital is only £25,000. A management with
a record like that doesn’t have to apologise
to its shareholders for keeping quiet about
a lot of things. Certainly the profits for the
past half-year are comparatively small,
lhey would have been a trifle larger if £5OO
hadn’t been voted to the Patriotic Fund.
For the rest, bucolic Victoria hasn’t been
making much money the last year, and this
co.’s commission earnings must have suffer-
ered in consequence. The worst of the
shrinkage may therefore be regarded as only
temporary.

It s a business full of queer noses and para-
doxes. A city is booming, there is a heap of
money about, and Monty makes rattling
profits. Apparently lots of people believe
with Holman that the less you need to bor-
row the more you ought to. Then things
sick; and Monty continues to make
rattling profits, apparently out of a new
lot of people—those who borrow because
thej aie hard up. On the whole, however,
ic looks as if the prosperous time for the
community is the most prosperous time for
a concern of this kind. This perhaps is the
reason. The co. isn’t a shark. It started
out with some sort of a conscience, and
appears to have kept it. It doesn’t charge
a man according to his necessity, bleeding
him the more the more desperate lie is. If
there is any bleeding to be done it prefers
to make a victim of the man who borrows
when he needn’t —the man who borrows in
prosperity in order to make himself appear
more prosperous than he really is. Hence,
probably, the bigger profits which on the
whole seem to be made in good times. A
further factor no doubt is that when times
become bad —especially if they become bad
suddenly—even a well-managed Mont de
Piete is liable to discover some doubtful
debts.
The securities are in the shape of pledges,
mortgages, etc.; and they represent all the
capital (£112,oOO) and most of the reserves.
It is impossible, of course, to check their
value in any way. The only thing one can
say is that the business has been going on
for more than 30 years, and nothing in the
way of over-valuation has ever been dis-
closed. The capital was increased a while
agd; but it is again insufficient to finance
the business, and there are overdrafts and
deposits of £15.008 —which isn’t enough to
worry about. The record has been one of
consistently good profits, whether times are
good or bad ; the risks of principal are very
well spread and very small, assuming the
careful management which the co. seems to
have had for as far back as this paper’s
record goes: and the co. makes its profit
without risking anybody else’s money to any
extent worth mentioning.

A sort of reserve has dropped into the
accounts—“ Provision for contingencies,
£852,” to which £5OO is now added. You
can, if you like, add the lot to the reserves,,
and make the past half-year’s profit £5OlO.
The capital is £60,000, and this and the re-
serves are represented by these assets:—
Cash and deposits .. ..£18,201
Advances on properties .. 54,872
Book debts and oddments .. 7,668
T , , -£80,741
Less liabilities (including contin-
gency reserve) 12,869
Net assets £67,872
Until quite recently the co. had most of its
funds in bank deposits. Only as far back
as two years ago the advances on properties
totalled no more than £21,252. Now, as
shown above, they are £54,872. It may be
that these advances bring in better interest
than deposits; maybe, also, they are
sprats to catch business. But prima facie
they carry a risk which deposits don’t. So
much for the principal. As for profit, unless
bad advances are made there is always a
trifle sure from interest. Of its £60.000 of
capital the co. might invest at least £57.500:
the other £2500 would be quite enough for
working capital. In fact, that teas all the
working capital the co. had to start with ; all
the rest was goodwill. Interest, then, ought
to earn a 4 p.c. dividend. It is for the busi-
ness to do the rest: find things must bo
pretty bad if it can’t show a profit of £OOO
per half-year, that being the amount neces-
sary to make up the balance of the 7 p.c.
dividend. In the dreadful second half of
1893. when people were combing the wreck-
s’"e of the boom out of their hair, the m-ofit
was £l9BB, practically all made from com-
mission earnings; and the average per half-
year for 1903. which was nearly as bad a
time, was £l9Ol. The recent borrowing boom
is dead, and the land speculators who made
more money _ out of it than anybody else
have had their run; for the next few years
there is going to be a dull time in the'real-
property market. But there will always be
odds and ends of business; and old-estab-
lished and reputable R. and W. won’t have
to pick up many of these odds and ends to
make the present dividend secure.

The co. has still been spending a bit of
money on the electric light part of the busi-
ness. Over that, by the way, it had a lot of
luck. It had for many years made a mere
pretence of supplying current. Then a for-
midable competitor appeared—and went
broke just before it could do any harm. This
co. took over some of the other co.’s rights,
and wisely decided that the business wasn’t
to be played with any longer. In the past
two years nearly £40,000 has been put into
that branch of the undertaking. In the
middle of 1913 the fixed assets of the gas
blanch were £99,861, and of the electric-
light branch £17,594. To-day the figures
are £104,503 and £53,462 respectively. The
character of the business has therefore
changed very considerably. So far, it can’t
be said that the new expenditure on the
electrical side lias been much of a success;
but, at any rate, the branch shows a profit,
and if it does nothing else the outlay keeps
the field clear. Towards paying for the
additions £9OOO was got in from sharehold-
ers : all the rest was borrowed. Total lia-
bilities are now about £42,000.
In the 10 normal years prior to June,
1913, the position had changed as follows :
1903. 1913.
Assets apart from works ..£10,350 £26,431
Liabilities 551 17,424
Surplus.. .. £9,799 £9,007
Meantime a good deal of profit must have
been put into extensions, etc. Anyway, in
10 years the co., while getting in no new
capital, and without reducing its surplus
of liquid assets by more than about £7OO.
so increased its plant, etc., that the sales
of gas went from £10,763 to £14.542, and
of electric light from £1364 to £5944. That
seems to show at any rate that the co. has
earned a good deal more money than
it. has paid in dividend. And even if the
new Electric works don’t bring in much
for a time, the bulk of the money is not
costing very much either. Altogether, then,
though Hobart Gas isn’t an investment with
glowing prospects, it has earned its divi-
dend and gradually put itself in a position
to make more money. This, if it does
nothing else, makes the present dividend
more secure.

Broken Hill is seething again. The agree-
ments between the cos. and the men at the
mines and Port Pirie expired by effluxion of
time on June 30. In May the Broken Hill
cos. proposed to the Amalgamated Miners’
Association, which is easily the strongest
union, that all then existing agreements
should continue in force till the end of the
war and six months after. The A.M.A. held
a mass meeting and accepted this. But then
the Port Pirie men, who work the smelters
and refinery, got busy. Some time ago they
had been offered a rise on the termination of
the agreement, and the A.M.A. had advised
them not to accept it, telling them that they
would all get more if they went to the
Federal Arbitration Court. They therefore
put it to the A.M.A. that the latter,
having induced them to previously say no,
was now in duty bound to push the matter
to arbitration. The A.M.A. said that was
right, and withdrew its previous acceptance
of the offer to keep on under the old agree-
ments.
Then negotiations started afresh. General-
manager Del prat met the Port Pirie men.
and, speaking only for the Associated Smelt-
ers, which owns the Port Pirie works, de-
clined to open up the question of wages and
conditions during the war. Next a confer-
ence was held at Broken Hill. The Port
Pirie delegates attended; but as the employ-
ers now represented only' the mining cos.,
and not • the smelting co., the employers'
representatives said they couldn’t deal with
the smelting industry at all. The union
reps, said that the two must be dealt with
together, or none at all. So that conference
was abortive; whereupon the A.M.A.. the
dominating union, carried a motion : “Fail-
ing a satisfactory settlement of both the
Port Pirie and Broken Hill claims or a
satisfactory assurance that the case will be
dealt with immediately by the Federal Arbi-
tration Court, we will cease work on Satur-
day. August 21.’’ And that is where matters
still stand. The position at Broken Hill
seems to be that there are two sections in the
A.M.A.. one of them, dominated by the presi-
dent, being favorable to a Strike, with some
vague idea that the Federal Government will

step in and order the business to proceed
with a Government comptroller in charge.
It is not certain that there will be a strike;
but a serious one is very probable. At
it takes place the men at the Broken lull
Prop.’s new steel works at Newcastle are
expected to down tools with the other em-
ployees of the co.
At the back of the men’s minds there
seems to be an idea that the cos. are. making
vast profits out of the high prices which have
been ruling lately in the metal markets.
1 lalf an hour’s conference, compulsory or
otherwise —the Federal Act provides for the
calling of comoulsory conferences —ought to
dispose of this idea. For all practical pur-
poses Broken Hill isn't in N. S. Wales so
far as the Industrial law is concerned. The
Broken Hill unions, though they send men
to the Assembly—one of them is a Minister
-will have no dealings with the State In-
dustrial law, and the Department has long
since apparently given up all idea of enforc-
ing any authority. There never was a
time when Australia could less well afford to
have men idle, either through a strike or for
any other cause; and Federal Attorney-
General Hughes may switch off his Metal
Exchange for a while to handle this other
problem. It is no use trying to get the
smelting of Australian ores transferred to
Australia if authority isn’t strong enough to
prevent the dislocation of the business by
strikes every now and again.
Last month North Broken Hill despatched
367 tons of raw slimes to the smelter at
Port Pirie, together with 2099 tons of lead
concentrates. Some of the slimes which
the Junction North bought and has on hand
assay from 10 to 13 p.c. lead, so one can
imagine such stuff becoming marketable
with lead at £2O. The four-weekly return
from the co-operative smelter stated that
2450 tons of slimes were treated, with 13,487
tons of concentrates, a. proportion of
roughly six to one. Junction North, after
paying over £BO,OOO for slimes, will be glad
to hear that slimes in any form can be
smelted economically.
* * * *
A mining engineer is now placed at the
call of general-manager W. H. Wesley, of
Bangadang, who is a metallurgist. Bulk
assays out of No. 1 adit go 50z.., and the
north drive at the No. 1 North mine, 850 ft.
away, give 2oz. dirt for 38ft. at a depth of
63ft. As if that wasn’t enough, No. 3
shaft, 2000 ft. off No. 1 shaft, gives ore
worth 23dwt. No wonder the 2000 ft. is
underlined double black in honor of the find.
Now all you want to know is if the ore is
continuous; and, when you come to think of
it, that point is rather important. The co.
has not only bought the Jack-a-lass for 080
fully paid £2O shares and £4OO cash, but it
has' secured Cole’s mine alongside for 100
paid ups. The Jack-a-lass has, on Wesley s
report, an outcrop 50ft. wide; and lie. testi-
fies that bulk assays down to 20ft.. in an
eastern shaft, range up to 17dwt. . In Mel-
bourne, between the beats of the big drums
and the flares of trumpet, the co.’s ban-ackers
talk of squeezing out sufficient capital from
reserve shares and contributors, to get a
plant going to raise the wealth Fisher wants
so eagerly to tax for war purposes.
* * * *
The Zinc Corporation knew wliat had
happened and felt very sore about it. The
others knew what had happened, too; but
they were wise enough to say nothing about
it. When the war started, the Broken Hill
Prop, notified the Corporation that the con-
tract for the purchase of the latter s lead
concentrates was suspended:
At first we were under the impression here that
they must actually have stopped smelting, in which
case the suspension, of course, was justified. At ..was
only much later, to our intense surprise, that we
found they had never ceased to work full time; then
we protested,, for, as war had not interfered, with
their working at Port Pirie, the war clause in the
contract plainly could not apply. I do not like to
suggest that they seized a very thin opportunity to
rid themselves of an onerous contract, hut we regal d
the suspension simply as outrageous. The result was
this, that we were forced into a position of either
having to put up with what we considered an illegal
and unwarrantable suspension of our contract, for
the group with whom they had made a working
arrangement during the war would not admit
ns to share in the arrangement for smelting
at all unless we accepted that position, or we were
left with no possibility of smelting our present out-
put, and with our sole remedy an action against the
Proprietary, which, under the circumstances, would
have placed us in a most invidious position; in
Australia such an action would have been regarded
as mean and unpatriotic, for this arrangement with
the North and South was primarily an arrangement
to keep labor employed. We had to sell our con-
centrates, and therefore we had to put our pride in
our pockets and to accept the share which they
offered. We were just in a cleft stick. I am not
going further to re-argue before you our views of
this question, hut under this compulsion and our
immediate necessity we accepted a four-eighteenths
participation, and again began to earn some revenue.
However badly we may think we have been treated
by the Proprietary people. I think this is going to
work out “somehow good,” for at last there is some
sign of real concerted action in lead-production and
in the selling of lead from Broken Hill. Our parti-
cipation was necessary, for if we did not participate
we could not sell our concentrates. No matter how
we raised the money W had got to take our share,
and therefore we did riot worry you with earlier dis-
cussion of' this matter.
And the Broken Hill Prop, with a mine
close to exhaustion, got rid ot a plant now
four times too large for its own needs, and
put the excellent price realised for it into
the steel works for which it was wanting
money badly! General-manager Delprat is
understood to own the brains that worked it
ail out.
The annual report of the Vic. Mines De-
partment shows that 21,7140 z. less gold was
won in 1914 than in 1913, though
dividends were about the same. Dredge
mining is dying slowly. It yielded
8G370z. less for 1914 than for 1910. More
tin was won, and there was a boom in anti-
mony. Costerfield, in the Ileathcote district,
produced the most of this metal, yielding
2439 tons concentrates from 7GOO tons ore.
The Costerfield co. got £l2 a ton for its con-
centrates on the average of the 12 months.
London cables a recent sale of star at an
alluring £l2O a ton. Most of the
antimony used by the United King-
dom comes from China, and nearly
all the balance—say 2000 tons—from
Australia. Another substance urgently
needed is diatomaceous earth, the basis ol
some of the explosives; 1000 tons were sent
away from Victoria last year. Insignificant
quantities of magnesite and manganese were
exported, although there are large deposits
of both in the State.
* * * *
Horatio Dickson’s Cassilis, Gippsland, is
looking up. Not that it deserves to, for it
has eaten as much money and paid as tew
divs. as most hoary-headed mining sinners
in eastern Victoria. Gold has been fairly
plentiful.' The trouble has been fuel and
the machinery man. Coote built a hydro-
electric plant, but he hadn’t enough cash
to erect a big dam, so when the drought
struck Gippsland Cassilis went into retire-
ment. Odd bits of development have been
kept going. Still with an overdraft ot
£3375 and a wad of forfeited shares,
caution has to mark the way. The bit ot
work done on the Ceresa reef has exposed
133 ft. of a shoot, to which A. J. Lilburne
gives a further length of 200 ft. As the
Ceresa shoot and the New reef alongside
carry good stone, a horseshoe is being nailed
to the door once again. Nearly all the
stone in the Cassilis reef is beaten out to
the No. 8 level. With funds short this reet
can’t be developed further till the co. gets
its Cobungra dam up. Everything there-
fore turns on Lilburne being right regarding
the Ceresa and New reef values.
* * * *
Charters Towers is feeling very seedy.
The Brilliant Extended has lately worked
at a loss, and reserves of stone are also
dwindling. The Freehold has connected its
workings on the hanging-wall reef with
those of the East Mexican, and the latter
has had a market flutter on the expectation
that the reef which fringes the boundary
will be payable. The Freehold has about
£12.000 in’ cash, but prospects are vague.
The Day Dawn is nearly worked out, and
the deepest levels on the Brilliant are dis-
turbed by a dyke. Papuan Brilliant and
Victoria is handing out its little dividends
at shorter intervals, and so is rather a
favorite with the local punter. Decently
492 tons were crushed for an average ol
£8 19s. 7d., which follows 323 tons for an
average of £lO 10s. Id. Between 5000 and
6000 tons have been crushed, and ild.-AHJ
has been divided. A new shaft is being
sunk to facilitate haulage of stone from the
cross reef, and it is possible this will lead
to further discoveries.
Whim Well Copper Co. (W.A.) is again
reconstructing. This time an effort is being
made to raise £56,250 by an assessment of
ss. per share ; but as a lot of the scrip is
held by Frenchmen at the Front, it is
doubtful if this latest appeal for more funds
will be heard above the dim The under-
writers have guaranteed £20,000 working
capital, and possibly on account of this, and
because anything is better than nothing, the
mortgagees (on whose hands the mine was
thrown when war was declared) have
agreed to accept debentures in the new
co in lieu of their present paper, bhould
reconstruction prove successful, and ship-
ping facilities permit, the despatch ot ore
oversea will be resumed for a time; but
the idea is to concentrate on the spot as
soon as possible.
* * * *
From a Melbourne spectator:—
Edna May (W.A.) didn’t get the reef at 300 ft.
till a diamond drill was set to work on the schist.
Before the diamond drill was called in the co. hail
bered out 29ft. with a rock drill, only to add to the
weight of water that had to be lifted. There were
curious goings-on in the share market all this while.
With scrip at £6 one day, £7 the next, up 15s.
the next, then down to £7, and at £8 6s. an hour
later, there was as much risk for the plunger as on
any tented field. The crosscut had to be stopped at
69ft., when boring was started amid water spurting
out like a bar of steel. Williams must have known
hi 3 chance ahead, because he could see no easmg-ofl
in the pressure in the 225 ft. level. As the diamond
drill hit the lode at 148 ft., it had to go a lot
further than most people computed. Surveyor Mac-
artney may he the exception, for he reported long-
since that the Deeps .to the north should get the
shoot between 4(}oft. and 500 ft. Anyway, it looks
a cert, that the shoot has flattened in its pitch; and
this seems to support Macartney’s opinion. But the
evidence can’t be conclusive till the ciosscut gets
into the lode, and that won’t be till the water is
subdued. If the drill drains the 225 ft. level, winzing
would tell the truth. It looks odds-on that pumping
troubles aren’t over by a long way. Manager Wil-
liams reported low-grade stuff in the drill core from
54ft. to 72ft. Then it entered “ore very rich in
gold,” said to be 2oz. stuff; and then it ran on
till it wobbled so much that Williams couldn t be
sure where the end would be. Ilence the width of
the lode is a mystery.
# * * *
“Oof Bird” (W.A.) : Edna May Deeps
(W.A.) continues to spend money—money
that it will badly want by and bye for sink-
ing—in crosscutting at 250 ft. Only poor
stuff has been exposed so far, but the co.
has expectations, based on goodness knows
what, of getting high values further ahead.
In time the co.’s calling power will become
exhausted, and all it will have to show for
the subscribed capital will be a gimcrack
plant, a shaft several hundred feet
short of its objective, and some exploratory
work en route which could have waited. The
co. would have done much better for share-
holders had it kept both eyes off the market,
installed a good serviceable plant and gone
deeper.
In a burst of optimism at the Great
Boulder meeting in London, chairman G. P.
Doolette said that during the past year the
reserves had been drawn upon to the extent
of only about 50,000 tons. The latest esti-
mate of ore in sight was 560,647 tons, so if
the reserves were depleted only to the same
extent from year to year there was 11 years’
life ahead of the mine. As usual a lot de-
pends on the “if.” It has been the blocking
out of partially developed sections from the
2000 ft. level upwards and the taking into
account of ore in the same workings which
in bygone days was not payable that has in
the last two or three years helped to swell
the reserves and so mask the real condition
of the mine. The bottom levels are prac-
tically worthless.
* * * *
Mount Bisclioff (Tas.) ended its half-
year on June 30 showing a net profit of
£2793. This is miles away from its old
form; but sanguine expectations are in-
dulged in that recently discovered alluvial
wash can be handled profitably. This wash
is to be hauled by electric tram and aerial
ropeway to the Waratah mill. The co-
operative arrangement with the workers ter-
minated some time ago, but from the experi-
ence then gained it is highly probable that
a bonus system will continue. During the
half-year 52,187 tons were delivered at the
mill, but 2889 tons were culled out as being
too poor. Altogether the smelter treated
12411 tons concentrates for 8561' tons metal.
Reserves of crudes are estimated at 1,720,000
tons, including 850,000 in the northern
slopes of the mountain and the North Valley
deposits. A market of £l6 per share means
£192,000, and some of it is decidedly specu-
lative.
Briseis is producing about 360 tons of
black tin a year, with (say) £20.000 worth
of gold. - Valuing black tin at _ £BO per
ton, the gross revenue from tin would
be £28.800, and at £9O it would be
£32,400. A sixpenny dividend costs
£15,000; so it is clear that costs must be
low for Briseis to do much in the way of
dividends. During the tin boom, when the
market climbed up to 2s. per lb., or £224
per ton, phenomenal profits were made. But
that is all past.

The news —what there is of it—from the
oil-drillers in the south-east of South Aus.
is cheerful. The S.A. Oil Wells Co., which
is at work near Robe, is down 1066 ft., and
reports: “Struck two layers of tar-sand or
dried-up oil sand. This indicates the pre-
sence of asphaltum base oil.” Previously
the bore passed through what has now been
identified as layers of grey shale impreg-
nated with paraffin wax. If there’s not oil
underneath, Nature is playing a dirty trick
on these cos.
* * * *
From the North :
If Vailala (Papua) is to be an oilfield and not a
joke it must be handled differently. The “well”—
a mere shallow hole —gave 100 gallons (a whole 30
bobs’ worth) for one week, and 50 gallons a week
thereafter. Everybody knows that petroleum quan-
tities are largely a matter of pressure, which is a
matter of depth; and on top of that the light oil
struck at Vailala is surely a pointer to natural dis-
tillation. The Papuan job, to be rightly carried
on, means depth; and that calls for a good oil man
to follow up the geologist.
“F.1.J.”: The Federal Government has
commandeered Australia’s production of wol-
fram, scheelite and molybdenum. The price at
which holders must sell is 555. a unit for
wolfram and 105 s. for molybdenum. The
wolfram concentrate must assay 70 p.c. of
tungstic acid, a really high standard, which
works out at about £l9O a ton c.i.f. This
punches out existing contracts, some of
which are on the basis of £250 to £3OO a
ton in London. At lOos. a unit ln&h-grade
molybdenite would be worth only £4OO a ton,
whereas late cables state the price at £6(5.
Before the war seven tons from N. S. Wales
sold for cash in London at £lOOO a ton. N.
S. Wales exported 61 tons, and Queensland
78 tons of molybdenite last year, and there
is plenty of room for development as long as
the Government doesn’t rook the producer.
The Transvaal Chamber of Mines publishes
some interesting information anent dust-
laying appliances. Water sprays are still
largely used on the Hand, and where the
pressure is sufficient they are effective.
Atomisers in some instances have super-
seded sprays because they convert the water
into a cloud of mist which carries much fur-
ther. Another apparatus used is a blast
which throws water in large quantities
through a nozzle by means of compressed
air. Neither sprays nor atomisers have,
however, succeeded in smothering dust; in
the plants where air blasts are used as
helps. Damp sawdust scattered over the
floors of the housed-in sample crushers has
also proved useful, as it arrests any ore dust
which may settle.

How to Have a Clear
Complexion.
It is quite easy even in a hot climate like
Australia to prevent the wrinkling, drying
and blotching effect of the dust and heat, but
it is absolutely necessary to use a pure soap
without any added coloring matter or excess
of soda. Puritol Wax Soap is such
a soap, with just a little fine per-
fume added, and some Puritol wax,
which has such a reputation for keeping the
skin soft and for removing pimples and
blotches. A very fine film of the wax is left
on the skin after using this soap, which
effectually protects the skin from heat and
dust. Its healing effect is well known on
blotchy skins, and undoubtedly many of the
fine complexions are due to the use of Puritol
Wax Soap.* n

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, August 16, 1915.
My Dear Arini, —
The landing of the wounded from the Bal-
larat was a much better-managed business
than the first painful scuffle. Woolloomooloo
draped itself in bunting. From attic win-
dows near the wharf the domestic broom-
handle supported the Allies’ colors in the
westeily breeze, (governor Strickland, with
General Finn and Secretary Budge, clat-
tered over the blocks in a chaise preceded by
mounted troopers. The blare of a band and
ihe yells of the urchins of the water-front
heralded the arrival of the invalids.
Drayloads of wattle were used up
m greeting the boys. Director Maiden

Ked Cross ladies fanned up the dust
in their efforts to be first on the scene
At irregular intervals that portion of the
crowd which was standing on stacks of loose
f }mber lia <i the monotony broken by falling
off it, to the joy of the spectators. Ear-split-
ting yells (who says Australians can’t cheer’)
welcomed the first car-load of Kangaroos.
Ibey looked surprised at the enthusiasm.
J ben they defended themselves. Fruit
sweets and cigarettes bombarded the
procession till the quiet roll of the
closed ambulances steadied the exuber-
ai; Tu‘ j, Dr. Mary Booth drove past
with a few convalescents. Premier Holman
and Ins missus whisked through the dustv
? pace ’ '?I ul , the hand, very red in the face
alter attacking a mile or two of Allies’
patriotic music, came back from the wharf
on wheels.
The late Fitzwilliam Wentworth, who
passed out the other day, was a son of
u lartes \\ entworth, whose connection with
early Sydney politics is a matter of small-
interest to you, Arini. What queer “societv”
it was that drove out for an airing in high
yellow gigs m the days when Fitzwilliam
wa* an infant! And there was that

A craft which has been having a spring

skipper-is Captain Segrave, R.N., a North
or England man, who is as communicative
as an oyster Perhaps that is why he was
attached to the British Embassy in Vienna
or a while, and chanced to be there when
the row began. >
Dorothy Blythe, the Melbourne girl who
was to have gone with Melba to the States,
didn't .pass this way, after all. Her young
man was expected home any minute (1 don’t
know whether it is from the war, or what),
so she changed her mind about seeing Life
with a prima donna.
'llie chief result of last week’s kinder-
garten meeting at Cranbrook was the
promise of a grant from the Government.
Minister Griffith announced that he would
put £lOOO on the Estimates, though he
didn’t promise that they would get it all.
Ihe Free Kindergarten Training College and
its tentacles, the infants’ schools in mean
streets, are chiefly supported by private
eftorts. In the course of time, when the
-National Education scheme is perfected, all
the work should be done by the State. Mean-
while the kindergarten school-marms are
doing, their bit, and cutting their garments
to suit the skimpy cloth.
The Amy Castles concert in aid of the Aus-
tralia Day Fund has been wiped off that slate.
Ihe great effort having already brought in
over half a million, it is now reckoned a fair
thing to have a little highway robbery on
behalf of those Allies for whom the hat
liasn t been sent around. Amy’s evensong
will go that way.
Some of the Strickland infants are going
up to Moss Yale this week to count the
chickens and see if the baby porkers are
quite well. Ilis Ex.’s staff is depleted these
days, but Eldest Daughter is a capable Help
in time of trouble. She can handle a type-
writer as well as many a girl who has to
earn a crust by it. And with the rest of
the family (except the baby) she is taking
lessons in physical culture. So if you see
clubs flying over the Cranbrook fence, don’t
be alarmed.
While the shearing was “on” YVingadee
originated some picnic races for Australia
Day. blocks of visitors turned up to be
shorn, and the clip was worth over £lOO.
Ihe man who sends this news suggests that
other sheds nearer to big settlements could
easily double the Wingadee total.
. Ada Crossley was to hifve been the first
singing lady in the all-star cast of “Henry
VIII. in London last month. It was her
first excursion into grease-paint.
Horticulture for women gets a set-back
when lady gardeners smell gunpowder in
France. Miss Eriksen was on this side with
a large note of interrogation as to the
chances offering for British horticulturists.
Ihen she hurriedly packed up her notebook,
and now is helping in a French canteen
where they serve up hot soup and medical
comforts to the fighting men.
Though one wide-brimmed hat doesn’t
make a summer, it is an indicator of lioav
things are going in millinery. I saw a girl
under a really wide-leafed black roof with an
extra inch laid on the edge in a tulle pleat
—raven colored,, of course. Fluffy little
pink flowers—quite unlike anything the gar-
dener grows—were tossed like small salmon
rissoles on to the crown. Yet it looked all
right. But perhaps it was the Girl who was
all right.
After nerve-shaking efforts to think of
something new, the Amateur Sportsmen’s
committee has evolved a scheme to run a
fancy street through the heart of the Town
Hall. Ihe Cafe Chantant (you do the buy-
ar,d the stallholder sings a Song of
.thanksgiving) is listed for September 4. The
street is mentioned as strictly Elizabethan,
which means that you may expect to receive
no change from ladies dressed as Assyrian or
Chinese bazaar-keepers. A fancy-dress ball
ni sht is likely to be the terminus of the
effort.
In spite of the abandoned conduct of the
weather on the night of the Hospice Con-
cert the committee gathered in about £5OO.
The sheepskin-vest committee is again on
the track of the woolly comfort. Dr. Read
of Parsley Bay, who took such a keen in-
terest in the first rally, is now in Egypt or
theieabouts with the A.jM.C. He is going
io avenge the death of a fine young son, killed
in the Gallipoli struggle, by looking after
the wounded with special tenderness. Irre-
sponsible optimists who galloped back from
Europe a few months ago were so sure that
the war would be “all over by Christmas.”
tha t the contributions for sheepskin comforts
slacked oft for a bit. But the committee is
going full speed ahead again, and wants to
know what you are going to do about it.
Well-furred rabbit skin makes a beautiful
i i‘st, too. In fact, a few of these garments
have actually been brought back from Europe
as presents for Australians who were about
to go on the march. Couldn’t the boys of
the country, with the help of their sisters,
be incited to do something in this line?
loinmy Kangaroo wants the clothes ever so
much more than bunny does.
The Sydney artists’ medallion souvenirs of
the. landing at Gallipoli have sold well, and
a tidy sum is in hand. John Lane Mullins,
who has been helping to look after the cash’
is shivering on the brink of one or two other
schemes for raising the wind for the lamed
kangaroo. But he means to get some more
medals off before the Lure of the Big Drum
takes him on to fresh acts of piracy.
Dr. Eric Barbour, who knows quite a lot
about cricket, was married the other even-
ing to Dora Grieve, of Bondi. The ’groom,
who has been practising at Toowoomba since
he got his license, is going to the usual ad-
dress—-the long, long, Front which seems to
have its back in the next world.
1915 spring fashions have a kind of
Hope I don’t intrude” air. Yet what one
sees of the new filmy materials is distinctly
pleasant. There are round, fat, white spots
on dark muslin grounds, and long thin stripes
on the same material. In the excitement of
shedding the worn-out coat and skirt of last
winter the plump lady who is 4ft. lOin. in
her Louis XVI. heels is bound to drape her-
self in spotted goods—and look rounder than
ever. _ This leaves the lean, streaky stuff for
the girl who is like a note of exclamation.
But the world is so upside down that these
minor casualties don’t count.
. Iu s ,V ite of a very tepid present interest
in mulberry leaves, the local Sericulture
Society said “And how are you?” the other
day. Its report shows that the 'industry
St, 11 ! creeping along. In thanking the
Girls i Realm for the use of its office, parson
Harris was too polite to mention the care-
less way silkworms have of arriving before
then- nursery is aired. A while ago, the
Realm ladies allowed a consignment of
much-travelled cocoons to be stored on the
premises. A week or so later they were
m , e t on ttie stairs by excited deputations
or silkworms, who were walking out of
Vickery’s Chambers into Pitt-street. Up-
stairs the floor was soft and squashy with
the rest of the colony. The Guild now re-
fuses to take in any more silkworm stock,
though it doesn’t mind giving talking room
to the growers.
Mrs ; Grant, a Westralian woman, had the
appalling luck to be laid up in England
when a Zeppelin dropped a bomb on the pre-
mises. The shock is supposed to have been
the cause of her end. A daughter, who was
injured by the same intruder, was very ill
when the last mail left England. Another
daughter. Miss A. E. Grant, is on the staff
of the Westralian. office in London.
he fact that sick khaki lads are entitled
to as good conditions when they’re in Aus-
tralia as when they’re anywhere else has
fhe Sydney woolmen. So the
ii 000-odd that the wool-bale and the side-
shows brought in at the Wentworth Hotel
rally is earmarked for local use. A scheme
is afloat to put the money into a hospital
ror sick men after they’ve got over the worst
ot it in Liverpool Camp. More cash to
keep the place going is promised if the
woolbuyers bring the idea to a climax.
a P? , , permission of George Marlow the
Adelphi Theatre housed the matinge for the
Cremorne Red Cross. There was the usual
acreage of attractions (and otherwise). Mrs
Marlow, in a box with Mrs. Ben Fuller, was
a vigorous bidder for the posies auctioned by
Trances Ross. In the stalls other lively
efforts were made to secure such bargains as
a dozen or two violets at a guinea. In the
opposite box a bevy of Helpers crowded in
behind the occasional yawn of young “Gerry”
Cooper. Two boxes full of khaki lads hung
over their eyrie, and a plump damsel on the
stage stretched her arms heavenwards and
warbled “Come, come, I love you only!” Ber-
tram Flohrn was vociferously applauded for
a sort of musical recruiting poster; Claude
Bantock, Torzillo, E. Wynne and Ratcliffe
were bright specks on a long, long horizon
of mixed music; and Mrs. Alex. Gordon was
heard at her best (owing to the excellent
acoustics) in “Caro Mio lien.” Finally, the
North Sydney Comedy Club supplied “Fac-
ing the Music,” which straggled on heroic-
ally through three acts.
. One of the speakers at the women’s meet-
ing m favor of early closing of hotel bars
said that “to the argument that early closing
oc hotels meant home drinking she would
trust the women themselves to find the
answer.” A grim sort of hint that!
The Sydney woman has been letting off
dense clouds of patriotic steam at recent
public meetings. From September 6 to 11
she 11 be able to vary her patriotic perform-
ances by gluing an inquiring nose to the
shop windows. “All Australian” Manufac-
tures Week is going to show us what a lot of
things our own country can make, and what
a lot of Australian things our own patriots
don a rule, buy. And it’s going to show
Mrs. Suburbs some of those other Australian
goods which she will be able to take home in
lier carryall when our infant factories get
enough Protection to see them through teeth-
ing. Even the Repertory Theatre will break
out into entertainments on the subject of
how r to make the wheels go round.
The Day Nurseries, where the Baby can’t
bump his head while mother goes out"wash-
ing. are languishing. The >orest Lodge
Nursery had its annual meeting the other
afternoon, the Cullen lady in charge. The
committee contrived to struggle through the
last year of storm with the help of a Gov-
eminent subsidy. But there was a general
feeling that something (goodness knows
what!) will have to be done to keep this
and other havens open till the war is over.
After a long bout of eye trouble, Mrs. John
Lemmone is getting back to normal health
amongst the roses and lawn-mowers of Kil-
lara.
Several massage nurses are being seni
away at the expense of private subscribers.
They go to Egypt or Malta, or to that
vague war-time address, Elsewhere. Mean-
time their services are likely to be at
least as badly wanted here. The long
khaki cloud of wounded is blowing this way.
Any patient in Itandwick Military Hospital
who needs someone to knead his muscles
has to go to St. Vincent’s Hospital to look
for it. Several nurses who are trained for
this line of business have been working two
or three times a week in an honorary capa-
city. This is greatly to their credit. But
it is less to the credit of the authorities. If
massaging is good for the patient it takes a
mighty lot out of the woman, and the
laborer is worthy of her hire.
The “Graytkwaite” equipment fete com-
mittee gave itself loud applause the other
afternoon. Three cheers for lion, treas. Mrs.
Cecil Mackay, and the same to lion. sec. Mrs.
Cecil Hordern, were supplemented by a vote
of thanks to yachtsman Trouton for hi. s
share in the outbreak. Mrs. Mackinnon, of
the Red Cross, dashed’in and added her
benediction, then whirled off to make a
descent on some other nest of conspirators
The total trawl was about £1490.
The revival of the children’s dance— ; for
the usual cause—was a delightful relief to
the steady plod of heavy entertainments.
Also,-it proves that the spirits of our tots
are not suffering from malade de Wilhelm.
Our girls—anything from three to 13—are
as determined to keep our boys in their
place as they were in the peaceful days
when England, labelled as a lion, was
really only a kitten with its eyes un-
opened. Any notion on the part of the bov
that his stock is sky-high was rudely dis-
pelled at this Patriotic hop in Paddington
-town Hall. One small male who didn’t
know his Lancers was heartily smacked bv
his juvenile partner, and another youth, dis-
guised as a tramp, was scornfully rejected as
too ugly.” These things hearten us up.
Woman may be in a dismally ascending
majority, but she is trying to make the best
of it. r
Mrs. Hay, who used to be Madeline
Docker, is living in Kent, along whose
miles of coast the children nowadays plav
upon telltale piles of sandbags. Her bro
ther George, of the 7th Royal Fusiliers, fell
m Flanders a while ago.
The Soldiers’ Club has only a temporary
foothold m the George-street premises. In
I-j or perhaps IS months the State Govern-
ment is likely to begin to tear the old place
up by the roots and build a Savings Bank
tneie* -Ike insecure tenancy is remembered
now when the committee begins to wonder
how it shall spend the cash that flowed in
from the sale of flowers on Violet Day. The
place was the old Royal Hotel; and there is
a suggestion that the ancient bar on the
ground floor should be heavily disguised as a
second billiard-room. The doing-up will
include digging out the remnant of flooring
boards, which are as holey as open-work
stockings after the heels have vanished in
the wash. But as architect Rowe is already
on the plans for the new bank, is it worth
while trying to resuscitate the unlovely corpse
of the old tap-room?
t Thompson, the handsome Stewart
Island girl who was taken up by Melba
some years ago, is keeping to concert work
on the other side. She had about 21
octaves of rich contralto and the tempera
ment of a cold white lily, so she heartily
agreed with her imperious friend that she
wasn t cut out for opera. I met Eri in her
native isle before Melba discovered the won-
derful voice. Her vision of a Better World
gave her a seraphic expression more suited
to a Heavenly Choir than to a stage liable
to be blistered by the remarks of a wrathful
stage manager.
In spite of Zeppelin raids, seaside bathing
was proceeding much as usual in England
last month. Mrs. Alan Carroll, who was
one of the founders of the Child Study Asso-
ciation here, was then taking her protegee.
Lilian Mitchell, for a daily dip at Hastings.
Lilian is a young Sydney soprano who is •
studying under Professor Uttley.
The Sydney woman this year approaches
fashion with many mental reservations,
lhe universal winter coat will hang out for
the rest of this month, though it may be
severely cautioned if a sudden snap of sum-
mer blows in. Even the leading shops are
making a tiptoe advance on new modes.
The times are out of joint for dress in
excelsis, but poor human nature (feminine
gender) is just aching for any old excuse
for a new spring frock. They’re mostly
flounced, so the clotkes-prop figure will, as
usual, have all the running.
Yours affectionately,
V ANDORIAN.

My Dear Yarrie, —
i -^ e au d Mayor put on his best rabbit-
skin and gave a memorable reception to the
Australian wounded on Tuesday. The
indoor part of the function was timed for
iree o clock, and the warriors were motored
lound the cheering city in triumphal pro-
cession for an hour beforehand. The crowds
were so dense and so eager that they surged
through all barriers and broke the
military caterpillar’s back in 19 places.
Cigarettes were passed up in hand-
tuls, and a soldier’s signal for a
match often started a sort of minor riot
Denerous cits were almost ready to throttle
one another over the question of precedence.
’'ne boy m khaki scored quite a number of
silver and gold cases. Before long the hel-
mets and khaki caps were wreathed with
wattle, boronia and daphne. The Maoris
were particularly cheerful, and yelled their
gieetmgs in their own brown language. But
despite all this cheerfulness, the show was
rather saddening—if you allowed yourself to
think too much. I found myself getting
too serious, and immediately repelled an
attack of the blues by cheering at the top
ot my voice and waving my Tuesday um-
oi elta. And Collins-street was no place to
iao P e , in ’ au y how - . ft looked like a far-
stretched bazaar, with its spots and splashes
or bunting making the very stones glad,
v here was a boisterous westerly wind blow-
ing. and everything that wasn’t tied or nailed
down flapped frenziedly against a back-
ground of racing grey clouds.
Indoors at the Town Hall the most valu-
able male citizens sorted themselves out on
the platform. The honored guests in uni-
roi m had the body of the hall to themselves,
and the invited stay-at-homes were directed
into the balconies, whence they could look
down on the heroes’ hair and see exactlv how
much each man had on his plate. "Food
was served by tea-room girls in brown, with
cute little caps and aprons. Sassiety girls
aloft gritted their teeth in envy at the
sight. The humility with which those same
tea-room dictators served the soldiers was
touching—particularly when one takes into
account the haughty way they serve the
ordinary public. The Mayor made a stirring
speech (all speeches have to be stirring now),
and Attorney-General Hughes followed up
with another.
The ever-faithful squattocracy flocked
down last week-end to see the finish of what
the horse-reporter, who has been reading
his war news, called the V.A.T.C. Jump-'
in? Campaign. Mrs. AVillie Manifold was
the commander-in-chief of the womenfolk.
She was in purple and black, with beautiful
turs. The Fairbairns, to a woman, yelled
with hysterical delight when Uncle Charlie
Fairbairn’s Booligal led nearly all the way
in the Four-mile Steeplechase, only to be
beaten in the last few strides by Battleship.
The Creswicks, all in black, had their hearts
on fine old Guncap, who leaped like a stag
but omitted to hurry sufficiently. G.-G.
Ferguson was there with a bigj cheerful
party of which the prize exhibit was Doris
Blackwood in cherry-pink silk crgpe and a
big black velvet hat. Another fetching item
in the vice-regal flock was Miss Mandeville.
a visitor, in an inspired frock of Robin Hood
f<'rest-green and a flung-baek cloak of fur,
the color of dead leaves. The attendant
army of Genthelps scrambled for the plea-
sure of attending on the pair. Grey hats
with black bands (the very latest in non-
military headgear) nodded and bobbed be-
hind the young lvomen.
Putty-color dresses were everywhere. The
shade verges on khaki, and is very smart,
r ernale spats are made as like puttees as is
possible, and most of the headgear seems to
be built on feathered military shapes. Furs
now consist of a whole skin of something
hung over the shoulders huntress-fashion,
with the paws, claws, head and tail dang-
ling barbarically. One Sassiety Diana has
all but the perishable interior fittings of a
big grey wolf.
The Connollys were very cheerful over
Orinoco s win and had a jolly tea-party to
celebrate it. The Herbert Powers are begin-
ning to come back into the winning world
again. Their Nari beat the favorite in a
flat race. Half a dozen Chirnsides haunted
the birdcage ’tween races, and the Officers
came along in a drove.
Amy Castles gave her big patriotic con-
cert on August 11. The seats were a
guinea and a half-guinea, and the Town Hall
was packed tight. Trust Old Ireland to
roll up with its hair oiled when the sham-
rock calls! Everybody who bought a pro-
gramme was presented with an Australian
flag. When all the flags were waved
together, there wasn’t .a lingering doubt in
anyone’s mind about the ultimate issue of
the war. Some girl choristers, dressed dis-
creetly in white, with red rosettes, began the
evening’s entertainment by intoning some-
thing or other, and a large electric star fixed
above the booming organ became a scintil-
lating glory as Amy took the platform. She
was diessed in a straight white satin gown,
into which she seemed to be packed softly
like a nice pink satin cushion. A big black
elution bow started at her shoulder, and
streamed down to the tip of her train. She
wore no jewels, but her brilliant smile was
full on all night. She got enough flowers
to start a shop, and one big trophy with all
the banners of the British Empire. When
the green harp flag appeared all the Pats
and Eileens in the place rose to their feet
and whooped. Naturally encores were fre-
quent, and the star sang all the better for
it. She came back again and again and
gave her clamorous admirers their full
guineas’ worth. G.-G. Ferguson went for-
SJ ,(1 , after lier last song and shouted
lhank you! in her pink ear. He was
compelled to shout, as the gale of applause
was blowing itself out in one last, tremen-
dous effort.
The vice-regal Ferguson and Stanley
aames and Mrs. Ilennessy were so enveloped
in long fur coats that they may have been
wearing any old thing underneath for all
the fashion spies could tell. There was a
real Melbourne blizzard blowing outside—a
n 5 ~t o dnye even the plumpest pair of
shoulders to cover. Dolores sat smiling be-
nignly in the balcony. Music lovers were
jambed together so tightly that it was hard
to see who was who. I wish they would
hang a trapeze from the roof for us literary
girls. We can’t attend functions on stilts.
Une woman was a target for every eve
within range. She looked like a Zulu
chiettamess in a head-dress consisting of a
heavy band of gold, with a warlike feather
hxed above the frontal bone and curving up
over the top of her head. She inhabited a
cloak ot lurid red, with hieroglyphics and
strange devices all over it. There were
priests galore in the audience, but none of
them could decipher the astrologer’s gar-
ment.
The two Governors and the Gaud Mayor
had a large party of the wounded soldiers
in their sacred semi-circle. One who looked
very fragile came forward and presented
Amy with a big Australian flag; at
the same moment “Bravo Australia!”
blazed forth in electrics over the old organ.
Amy twiddled her flag (it was 30
times bigger than herself) and all the audi-
ence waved till the whole place was a-flap.
That elephantine institution, the Overseas
Ciub, gave a big reception to Louise Mack
last week. The function only failed in one
respect—the lady was not "present. It
appears that Louise was given no hint that
the affair was to be a gigantic welcome; so
she modestly drifted in at about five o’clock,
when the Overseas had broken up, after put-
ting aside their addresses of welcome, a book
ot pressed gum-leaves, some bouquets and the
sandwich they had saved for her. The assem-
bled welcomers waited anxiously while she
was telephoned for frantically all over town.
The Club, of course, forgave the guest, and
showed that there was no ill-feeling by going
m a mass to the Saturday matinee lecture
and taking tea with the lecturer afterwards.
1 he Madden Dame attended, which was very
noble of her, seeing that she also provided a
Mack tea-party at Cliveden on Friday. That
time Louise was there on the stroke.' A tea-
bell sends her jumping now.
Louise Mack is now lecturing on “The
H Oman in the V ar,” which sounds much
JP. 01 ’® „ t 0 t he Point than “Midst Shot and
bheli. Her talks, which are quiet, humor-
ous and chatty, are getting audiences of
naice people who have that comfortable,
after-dinner look, and drop in as if to a
friend s house. On Friday night the pas-
sionately patriotic lecturer had a brush with
two ill-mannered people in the front seats
Ihe pan- kept up a lively and irritating
clatter ot attempted criticism. Louise at
last stopped her lecture and imperiously
demanded their attention and finally their
absence. Their pro-Hun objections to hear-
ing the Belgians pitied reminds me that in
one ot the letters which Continental Tyre
Edwards” wrote to his mother in Vienna
he spoke of “subscriptions for the ‘poor’
Belgians as though their distresses were a
recognised German joke.
Poor Jacob Astley has been given two
years in England for forgery. You will
remember him as a resplendent visitor at
Government House when the Dudleys were
here. His brother, Lord Hastings, was a
friend of the Dudleys, and so they be-
friended Jacob. He was a hopeless propo-
sition, however. Young, amiable, admirably
diessed, sober, and astonishingly good
looking, he had one defect. He had no more
notion of going straight in money matters
than a Turk has of washing himself. The
Dudleys found him on a N. S. Wales station
where he was remittancing, having been
compelled to fade out of the 36th Lancers
m connection with a cheque unpleasantness.
3-hey didn t know about the cheque at the
time, and had him to stay with them for
the races. The next thing the simple-minded
Australian King knew he was betting with
its leading members in hundreds. He also
betted heavily at the different gun clubs
and anywhere else lie could get people to
take the odds. His method was to collect
when he won and omit to pay when he lost.
Lord Dudley paid his racing debts twice and
then instructed him to move on and never
return. For some time the unhappy youth
acted as waiter at a fashionable Melbourne
restaurant. Then Lord Dudley relented and
paid his passage to Ceylon. Within a week
lie was in the Colombo lock-up. xhe local
whites, banded together in the interest of
the British “liaj” or whatever it is called,
got him out and shipped him to S’Africa.
M hen the old trouble came upon him in
England he was in a Yeomanry Regiment
that was just off to the Front.
Molly Fink married her Rajah in a gasp-
ingly tempestuous manner. After lunching
together at the races they suddenly disap-
peared, leaving word that they had “gone
to get married.” The Wolfe Fink daughters
are those two big-eyed darlings with oval,
ivory-skinned faces and pouting pomegranate
lips. They looked as if they should be
dressed in Persian “bags” and veils. The
Rajah has become well known in Melbourne
and Sydney as a lavish host and a first-class
card-player, a keen race-goer, and a wonder-
ful judge of horses. He has black eyes, a
fine physique, the black clipped moustache of
the British military man, and a very bold
outlook on life generally.
Blamire Young, the Australian artist and
aesthete who went to England a year or two
back, is at the Front, as a sergeant. “It is
hard work,” he wrote from Salisbury Plain,
when finishing his training, “but, on the
whole, preferable to allowing others to do
my work for me.” Which paints the pic-
ture so plain that even the loafer may
understand.
Fred Villiers, the war artist with the
curled moustache who lectured in Melbourne
when Brassey was king, will come out here
early next year to lecture some more. Vil-
liers was the only Britisher in the business
who got an invite from both Governments
to visit the French and Anglo-Belgian
trenches. Carlyle Smythe, now in France,
has booked both the tremendous Villiers and
the modest C. E. W. Bean for war lectures:
Carlyle will leave France for London in
October, and pick up some more platform
attractions, if possible, before returning to
Australia.
Artist Max Meldrum Avas the other day
segregated from his appendix and is now
doing nicely, thank you, in a private hos-
pital at St. Kilda.
Tall, auburn-haired Ilarrie Ireland, the
bad girl of innumerable Bland Holt produc-
tions, is having a very painful time just
now. For several years the willowy Harrie
suffered with an affection of the hips and
knees, and a j'ear ago or more her case be-
came so serious that a specialist took it in
hand and tied her up in splints and plaster.
Then for many weary months she reclined
on a hard mattress trussed like a
mummy. With this treatment the hips were
got to work satisfactorily; but the knee-
joints became quite rigid. So now the poor
girl is undergoing the fearfully painful pro-
cess of having the stiff joints bent —a very
ticklish job. Dr. Mackeddie is committing
the cruelty.
The Rileys are taking Lieutenant Condor
in at their Toorak home as soon as that
brave Tasmanian is convalescent enough to
move from the Base Hospital. Lie was
literally peppered with bullets, having seven
of them distributed about his body.
-The Rileys (he, by the Avay, owns the
Epsom racecourse) ha\ T e just finished wel-
coming their daughter, Mrs. Robert Dunn,
whose husband is a son of Mrs. Lorimer. At
latest advices, the newly-married pair had
departed to their farm at Lyndhurst.
The deeds and misdeeds of Adelaide:—
Lieut.-Colonel Patterson, who was amongst the inva-
lided on the Ballarat, looks forward to an early
return to Gallipoli after he 'has put in a few days in
Melbourne on business and “spelled” for a while here.
Mrs. Patterson has made Adelaide her headquarters
during her husband’s absence, and her small sons are
at St. Peter’s.
Corporal George P. Stewart, the eldest son of
the Engineer-in-Chief, has won his D.C.M. and a
commission in the British Army for carrying urgent
messages under fire during two fights near Ypres.
The latest notable addition to the list of local
recruits is W. J. Denny, M.P., who has handed over
his lawyer’s business to E. W. Benham. His brother,
an R.C. priest, at the same time offered his services
as a chaplain.
The Mayor, who has been on the sick list for over
two months, returned to his job on Monday. Mrs.
Simpson has been overdoing it, too, and has gone off
to try to find some place where Funds will cease from
troubling and she can be at rest.
In spite of war and drought and other disabilities
the scheme for re-constructing the Norwood Town
Hall is being pushed through. The work was com-
menced in September of last year and is nearly com-
pleted. The opening, which is to be done
by the Governor at the end of the month, will unlock
a stage said to be larger than that of any theatre in
the city.
The appointment of women J’s.P. has given the
Petticoat the courage of its aspirations, with the re-
sult that it has demanded that it shall be represented
on the Board which is to control the Wounded
Soldiers’ Fund. The Chief Sec. was sympathetic and
promised to do what he could. It seems a reasonable
request. Most of the hard work of collecting has been
done by women, and as the fund is for wounded sol-
diers and the dependents a good deal of the relief
work will be among wives and children.
On Saturday the Governor returned from the North
in connection with the recruiting campaign, and then
he and Lady Galway left for Broken Hill. A civic
reception, a Patriotic race meeting, a recruiting meet-
ing, a Red Cross meeting, a tour underground, and
presumably a strike or two will be provided for their
entertainment there.
Ex-Governor Bosanquet’s only son, who has been
twice wounded, has got his D.S.O.
Ruth, daughter of the “Dick” Butlers, has made
the world look brighter for the elder of the W. G.
T. Goodman sons.
Archdeacon T. F. O’Neill has been elected Vicar-
General in succession to Monsignor Byrne, who died
last month. He came from Cork and worked for
about 30 years in the country districts till he was
given the comfortable Glenelg parish last. year.
A Coster Market Fair in aid of the Orphan Homes
was run in the North Adelaide Institute on Saturday,
and a brisk business was done at carts and barrows,
b> suitably bedizened salesmen and saleswomen, after
Lady Galway had said the word “Go!” On the same
evening- Cawthorne’s new concert hall—to be known
as the Queen’s—was opened with an entertainment
eaimarked for the “Cheer-Up” Club for wounded
soldiers. Another Red Cross concert is billed for
September 18, in the Town Hall, with William
Silver, Eugene Alderman, Harold Parsons and George
Pearce as the promoters. And Violet Paine is
arranging- to make scenes from grand operas do a
bit for the Wounded Soldiers’ Fund at the Queen’s
Hall at the end of this month.
the military is said to have its eves on the
Adelaide Oval and on at least one of the race-
courses. The S.A. Cricket Association will do all
it can to facilitate matters if the Oval is required,
and sC will the racing clubs. Very virtuous, of
course, though they can’t very well help themselves.
Tlie Moores, who draw large means of sub-
sistence from a titanic “emporium” in Perth
have acquired the Toorak house which was
built for the \\ illiam Gumming family, and
which, minus its park lands, passed into the
possession of the Robert Larkins. The
Larkin widow is now one of the absentee
•propputy owners whom Providence would
tax heavily if it had any political power to
speak of.
There has been an addition to the familv
of Attorney-General Billy Hughes. Mother
and daughter are both doing well, and father
is bearing up splendidly.

The Penitent.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[COME, a penitent,
To be forgiven.
By you, my passion’s saint,
Must I be shriven !
This is my master-pose.
Dear, cease your sighing ;
I am a penitent—
Peace to your crying!
Knowing that you were wrong,
My heart, relenting,
Comes still to be forgiven,
Humbly repenting.
This is the comedy
Keeps love still living;
Love with a newer song
Springs from forgiving.
Lift up your eyes to me ;
Peace, dear, to sighing.
I, as a penitent,
BrOok no denying!
Lift up your arms to me,
All cold wrath banish ;
Lift up your lips to me-
So quarrels vanish!
These are the sweetest hours
Love gives for living;
When I am penitent
And you forgiving.

THE HORSESHOE AND THE CLOCK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BENiNU was making down the hill to the
horse-ferry rather early this fresh
June morning with, apparently, no
load; but, with a glance at the set of the
horse—holding back, with hindquarters well
hunched, and carefully picking his steps—-
the experienced eye could detect that Benno
did have a load, and a heavy one at: that.
And a look oyer the tail-board showed the
bottom of the cart covered with old black-
smith’s ironmongery of every description,
from half an axle to the biggest horseshoe
I’d ever seen. It was plainly ,a find and a
bargain in some dead old smithy; for the
metal had a damp rustiness about it that
you’d never find in any living shop.
Benno turned in under the rock by the
shinsmith’s, unhitched the nose-bag from
under the tail of his turn-out. and hitched
it on at the other end, where it would do
most good, putting the string up over his
horse’s ears with unconscious gentleness and
giving the coarse black tuft of mane a tug
down under the forehead strap of the wink-
ers—as is Benno’s way. Then he got a billy
and a packet of tea and sugar out of the
little “boot” on the step of his cart, and took
them into the shipsmith’s forge, while I
annexed the big horseshoe to hang it in the
shop till I’d be coming back that way. I
wanted to take it home to make a
“cradle” for my alarm clock —heels up, so’s
the luck won’t spill out, which is the way
with our tribe of gypsies.
Benno got two tots, a parcel of good corn-
beef sandwiches and a bag of bananas out of
(he “boot,” and we sat down on a baulk of
timber, with our backs to the sunny side of
the shipsmith’s shop.
I remarked to Benno what I wanted the
horseshoe for.
“An ounce of luck is worth a ton of judg-
ment,” says Benno.
We both scratched our heads to find out
the application, and then reached for our
tots and tea in mutual self-defence.
’ And then I inadvertently committed an
unpardonable breach of camp etiquette by
dipping my tot in the billy; whereupon
Benno slowly, carefully and thoughtfully
decanted the tea into his tot, and so
regained all the ground he had lost —and
something more. He seemed so aggressively,
dreamily satisfied and contented about the
turn of affairs that I was forced to ask
‘abruptly :
“Well! What do you think about the
war?" v
< x I couldn't’help it.
“I don’t • believe there’s no war,” said
’Benno very deliberately. “It’s only a fake.
At least,” he added guardedly and with un-
necessarily bad grammar, "I ain’t seen no
war. But I had me ownfppihions all through
the Boer wa’r, while you was in England;
and I nearly' got me head knocked off half
.a dozen times —only I half-knocked the
other bloke’s off first. IVe can’t help it—
the wrongs and rights of it: will sort them-
selves out in the end ; just the same as they
And the atrocities too.”
Then there was a long silence.
I was walking down George-street the
other night,” said Benno, brightening up at
the recollection, “when I saw a winder with
‘Help!’ written up alongside in tall letters,
and a big red cross pasted on it, with a
Pretty nurse—leastways she was more like
a housemaid, her hands held out in front as
it she was explaining that little Willie had
broken the big dinner-dish. Alongside on a
dummy was about the most jim-jam suit of
clothes I ever seen. Made out of a length
ot blue blanketing and cut gaol-bird fashion,
and built for a man eight foot high too. The
card said it was one of a consignment for
the poor Belgian soldiers, and it was hooked
to reach ’em just before the hot weather in
those parts. Blime, when our brave little
Belgian soldiers open those parcels thev’U
laugh for the first time since the war brok"
out!
But it isn’t all like that,” continued
Benno. There’s a little girl I know. She’s
been making one-legged pyjamas. They’re for
the wounded soldiers. You see, the only
wounded soldier she ever saw was old John
the Frenchman, and he was one-legged, l
hope they’ll understand when they open that
A LOYAL FOLLOWER.
SANDY: “Hey. Donaal', I would ask ye to hue a dram hut I hear ye're a follower o’ th'
King."
DONALD: "Ho! Sandy, so I am; but Ah'm too loyal a subject to tread on Ms Majesty’s
heels."
parcel. Old John died towards the end of
last year in St. Vincent’s Hospital—on the
night when the news came m of the retreat
of the Germans from Paris. Did I tell you
about that?”
I nodded.
“But they’d read him the news first,” said
Benno, triumphant.
“No. I don’t hold with this rattling of
boxes in the streets, an’ simperin’ and grin-
nin’, and mean, paltry back-biting. There’s
more decent ways. £. When the South Afri-
can war was ending the Old ’’Un didn’t say
anything. He just‘ set to work and built a
little room out of, packing-cases and odds
and ends against the fence on the sunny
side of the backyard, and roofed )j,t with some
old nine-foot sheets of iron I’d brought home.
He floored it with corrugated-iron casfes, laid
upside down. He told us he wanted a little
place where he could get a bit of peace in
his old age. Inside he rigged up two old
wire stretchers that I’d brought home, and
we mended a ricketty little old table and
put. it in the place. And then we found out
what it was for —months after our boys came
home he always hhd one, and often two.
of them camped in the hut till they got jobs
in the place of the’ old ones that had been
taken from them. They managed about
tucker between themselves and the Old Girl
and people of Our Lane. Somehow —I don’t
know.
“Long ago the Old ’Un used to tell us
about two young fellers that went to the
Crimea, and about the night someone put
his head into the tent and called them out
to join a burying party. And both the boys
sat down on the muddy clay, in the rain
and dark and cold, on the edge of that pit—
and howled. You see, they were the Old
’Un and Uncle Ned.
“He goes up and draws his Imperial pen-
sion now, the first of every three months, at
the old place near the top of Lower George
that was built three years before the Battle
of Waterloo. lie’s been doing it ever since
the Boer war. Homebody fixed it up for
him. He had his papers and medals all
right in a little brass-bound cedar box In-
kept locked up at home. Yes, I let him draw
that—it isn’t like the Old Age Pension. The
Old ’Un has his “identification disc” all
right. Sometimes I wish to God I had mine.
“Me and the Old ’Un often sit a-side the
fire of nights now, thinkin’ —him storming
the heights of Alma, or Sebastopol, or some-
thing; me stormin’ the depths of Bottle-
O-Land. We don’t look at each
other such times, and don’t speak;
but we see each other without look-
ing and speak to each other without talk-
ing. The Old ’Un and me are pretty lonely
now—since the Old Girl went up country.
“One night, only a week or two before she
died —just at the beginning of the war—
I went down to spend the evening at the
old place. .Just as I was going to open the
door I heard a voice I hadn’t heard since I
was a kid, and I tiptoed to the winder.
Blime, if there wasn’t the Old ’Un sitting at
the olcft harmonium waking her 4 - up ! And
mother standing by his side, with her old
shawl on, and v her little, withered hand oh
his shoulder, singing ‘When Johnny Comes
Marchipg Home’ ! They were back in \ the
Crimean days. ■
“I went away for a while, and when I
came back the old folks were sitting very
close together, holding reach others hand and
looking-into the fire. I thought Of something
I’d fdrgot to do, and didn’t go in that night.”
Benno stood up and stretched himself.
“Yes. I’ve got my dreams as well as you.
But you can write yours down and print
’em, and get rid of ’em, or drown ’em, for
"awhile. I’ve got to keep mine. Thef’fe
printed where they won’t do anybody 'any
good. Branded, rather.
\ “Yes —dreams of doin’ arrest.filings and
' «
bein' a hero. But, then, I’ve got no Past t<>
be wiped out (I sometimes wish to God I
had), and no missus for the Victoria Cross
to be sent to, and the Old Girl’s dead, and
the Old ’Un wouldn’t last long enough.
1 don’t thin'k lie’ll put this winter through,
and the doctor doesn’t either. I’ve got
a woman looking after him now—Mick
the Rabbo’s mother. When he goes I sup-
pose I'll get to the Front, too, and pigsticlc
somebody in baggy breeches that never tried
to queer my pitch or trespass on my beat
in all his life.”
He put the billy and tots back.
“Here’s Rabbo Mick coming across on the
punt now. Give him a nod and he’ll lea ve all
the heads you want for your dog. Now,
then, old Geddup !”
And he took the nosebag off.
Rabbo Mick told me this morning that
Benito's “Old ’Un” died three weeks ago, the
very night of the day of our conversation :
and Benno had had him buried alongside
mother at Itookwood; and Benno had left
everything to his brother-in-law to fix up—
and had enlisted !
It surely must be more than midnight! I
didn’t expect to finish before daylight. I
take my clock from its horseshoe stand and
put it to my head to hear if it’s going; and
it says:—
“Benno’s gone for a soldier! —Benno’s
gone for a soldier! —Benno’s gone for a
soldier!....”
Benno, good-night!
HENRY LAWSON.
A Word from Mabel’s Mother.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT’s about Mabel. Mabel’s my dorter
and she got married the other day,
an’ ’er father—’e’s not really ’er
father, me an’ ’im’s not livin’ together —’e
give ’is consent. ’E’s one of the best men
Gawd made, and a choir boy for years and
an Eyetalian-Orstralian. I wasn’t goin’ ter
support a drunken ’usban’, so ’im and mo’s
separated, and ’e give me a pound a week.
He gets two poun’ ten, and pays a poun’ fer
board, and ’as ten shillins to spend on ’im-
self.
“Mabel’s not what you’d call good-lookin’,
but you ort to see ’er ’air. It’s black as
anythink, and only about that long, and I
allers took such a time doin’ it, rows and
rows of curls. Everybody used ter talk
about ’er ’air, and the sergeant ’e used ter
say, ‘Elio, Curls.’
“Mabel’s only 17 and allers a virchus
girl, and never give me a back hanser all
the days o’ me life. She’s a roller at the
fact’ry, and everybody in the ’ole place is
real fond of ’er, and she brings ’ome ’er
wages regler. I got another one cornin’ on.
but ’er ’air ain’t Mabel’s. ’Er brother ’e’s
so fond of ’er; ’e’s all broke up at the
weddin’ (sniff), ’er sister’s all broke up.
and my ’art’s broke too (sniff). We’re all
broke up about it, and ’er brother ’e’s gone
and ’listed (prolonged sniff)....
“Yes, I’ll miss ’er wages, but there’ll be
one less to keep, and meat’s ’igh. Still, we
wos gettin’ on fine, and now that scoundrel’s
co,me. and it’s all ’is mother’s fault, she
wantin’ t’ ’ide the shame. I was goin’ ter
stop it, and I got inter the ’bus to get there
in time, but it broke down, and was three
’ours afore I got t’ the church, and when I
got there the weddin’ was over.
“And now Mabel’s got ter put ’er ’air
up, and all me time on ’er curls wasted !”
S. T. A.
Moonlight.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I do not like the moonlight on your hair!
It g reys your tresses like the touch of years;.
Till fancying Love is dead and shrouded
there,
I feel a sadness and a sense of tears.
I cannot bear the moon upon your face!
It frightens me. The moving of your breath
And your faint sighing, mark the only trace
That this pale brow is not the brow of Death.
Nor must a bright beam ever stay among
The wonder lashes of your eyes again!
It gives an anger, and I fear your tongue
May frame a word to cut my heart in twain.
So do I hate the moon, since it wpuld slay
My joy; and round about your pretty throat
I twine this soferf to keep its hands away.
And fold you closely—so!-—within my coat.
MAOKILAND.
BOYCE BOWDEN.

FRUIT LAXATIVE FOR MAMMA, DAD,
BABY, “CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.’’
Better than calomel, oil or pills to clean
and regulate liver, bowels and
stomach.
Mother, daddy and the children can always
keep feeling fine by taking this delicious
fruit laxative as occasion demands. Nothing
else cleanses the stomach, liver and bowels
so thoroughly without griping.
You take a little at night and in tkj morn-
ing all the foul, constipated waste, sour bile
and. fermenting food delayed in the bowels
gently moves out of the system. When you
awaken all headache, indigestion, sourness,
foul taste, bad breath, fever and dizziness
are gone; your stomach is sweet, liver anti
bowels clean, and you feel grand.
California Syrup of Figs’’ is a family
laxative. Everyone from grandpa to baby
can safely take it, and no one is ever disap-
pointed in its pleasant action. Millions of
mothers know that it is the ideal laxative
to give cross, feverish children. Ask your
chemist for a bottle of “California Syrup of
bigs,” which has directions for babies, chil-
dren of all ages, and for grown-ups plainly
y n the bottle. Ivemember there are coiinter-
ieits sold here, so look and see that your
bottle bears the name of “California Fig
Syrup Company.” Hand back with contempt
any other fig syrup. “California Syrup of
Figs is sold by all leading chemists 1/1 &
and 1/9. '
ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“Boronia”: If anyone knows of a hard-
wood that warps and shrinks more than the jarrah
of A\ estralia let him be heard. AA’ood of any other
variety will twist to a certain extent, but if it
possesses fair dimensions, the warpage is scarcely
perceptible, while a jarrah beam after a few days’
sojourn in the sunlight presents the contours of
the midnight inebriate’s track. Boards cut from this
vegetable warp until they resemble our landlady,
hence the necessity for drying case-slats under a
heavy weight. I once knew a new-chum fruitgrower,
who, scorning advice, spread out a few dozen shocks
of jarrah cases to season. At the expiration of a
week he discovered that they had almost tied them-
selves into a knot, and were quite unfit for use.
Because of its amazing capacity for shrinking, car-
penters who know their job wouldn’t dream of
putting a jarrah floor down before the boards under-
went at least a year’s seasoning. No matter how
long a piece has been cut a planing on one side will
cause it to further shrink a little. When the police-
quarters at Bridgetown ( AV.A.) were being renovated
a few years back, two jarrah boards an inch thick,
which for 35 years had been in use as a shelf, were
replaned; and, although they were well rejoined, at
the end of a month it was possible to insert a fine
knife-blade between them.
* * * *
"Billybuiiger”: Can any Abo-vvriter tell
me why lightning has a particular affinity for cer-
tain breeds of trees? One time, when on Milo (Q.),
I was riding down a watercourse, along a pad that f
I had travelled numbers of times before, when
ahead of me 1 discerned a tree that looked totally
different from anything I had seen thereabouts
before. On coming up to it I saw that it was a
tall gidya with a big blaze down the trunk where
lightning had left its kind regards. On scouring
round I found three others that had had similar
attention paid them by lightning. All were gid-
yas. The same thing is often noticed in a dump
of ironbark, nothing else being assaulted in a patch
of timber.
“Barrier'’: Those colt-breakers who,
according to “Lou,” mount the brumbies in the
open must bo pretty tight-legged. I’ve battled
about the AYestern division of N. S. AA r ales for a
few years ; arids haven’t dropped across one of them
yet. I’ve had a seat on the Board of Advice (the
top vail of the stockyard) whilst the Dempsey Bros,
of the ’Bidgee, have been on the job; also I’ve
watched Brady, of the Lachlan; likewise Tomlins,
of Mill-field, Ivanhoe; the Gough Bros., of Xetley,
on the River Darling; Sharp, of Yancannia ; and
“Charlie” of Topar, outside Broken Hill. The
round yard is plenty big enough for any of this
crowd. They, all tell me the colts can’t get going
in the small yard. And about the only “stroking”
these chaps do is with the double of the stock-
whip. If any of “Lou’s” young school can “rough”
with the crowd I've mentioned I'll resign my seat
on the board.
UNSATISFACTORY PERCY.
PERCY : "Let's take a walk out in the moonlight."
MABEL: "Rut you won’t behave yourself.”
PERCY: “Yes, I will —I promise.”
MABEL: “Well, WHAT'S the use?”
MIXED FEELINGS.
SCHOOLMARM : “I hope, Willie, your father pare you the thrashing you deserved ?”
KID: "No, Miss; 'e 8ed it ’ud ’art ’im more'a me.”
MARM : "Pshaw! Sentimentalism!”
KID: “No, Miss —roomatism!”
"Bay Clerk” : May I butt into the argu-
ment between “VA'odji,” “AA'.C.F.” and “G.J.11.”
about the respective merits of the revolver and auto-
matic pistol, with the statement that 1 have fired
over 300 rounds from an K.X, 25-cal. auto, without
it jambing? One objection to the revolver is the
escape of gas between the cylinder and the barrel.
1 his means the bullet doesn’t, in that weapon, get
the shove-behind which -the auto, gives it, and which
accounts for the superior velocity of the outpourings
from the latter weapon. 1 have found the best
makes of revolvers jamb frequently owing to “leading”
between the chamber and the barrel. Their ejectors
also have a bad habit of going out of commission
through the swelling of a discharged cartridge. I
haven’t yet found a firearm without a certain amount
of kick, but the auto, robs the kick of most of its
•force by using it to work the ejector slide. This
slide drives back on a spring, which performs the
same function for the auto, that the recoil cylinder
does for a field gun. That is, it absorbs the shock.
Several breeds of auto, carry 10 cartridges to the
clip. No revolver is chambered to take that quantity
of ammunition. The fact that there are 50 revolvers
to every auio. in the Backblocks proves nothing,
as the auto, is only a recent arrival in the field.
The station-hand’s revolver is mostly used for putting
an injured animal out of misery. The safety lock of
the auto, makes it pretty well fool-proof, and If
Alary Ann lets it crash on the floor in the process of
turning the mattress you won’t be faced with a bill
for her funeral expenses. The same can’t be said of
the revolver, which has a nasty habit of going off
when it’s not wanted to.
l’iaki : Mention of the occult powers
of “Moana’s” Maori (B. 22/7/’ls) reminds me. I
was with a toliunga (medicine man) and another
native on an occasion when they both claimed the
same dog. At the height of the quarrel the toliunga
exclaimed: “J/«. tc tohunga te taonga,” which is
“the privilege is the wizard’s.” Then he seized a
stick and pointed it at the dog. His misguided
brother looked towards the tike, and gave a start of
horror, lie slunk away, and, in a hoarse voice, told
the tribe of how the stick bad sprung from the
toliunga s hand and killed the subject of dispute as
dead as. Adam’s maiden aunt. I was paralysed when
1 heard this, because I saw the old chap kill the
dog* five minutes after Henare had departed. 1
still don’t know which of us was hypnotised.
‘Tola’’: One of the most interesting burial
customs in New Guinea is that of the AVagaia tribe
in the headwaters of the AVaria River, lately
Kaiscrwilhelmsland. The corpse, in a sitting’ pos-
ture, is placed in the fork of a tree, and a lofty,
chimney-like structure of matting is built around it
to carry off the effluvia. Small apertures are made in
the foot of the covering* through which the gruesome
ex-resident is inspected at various intervals. If his
body sweats it is indicative of the coming of in-
vaders, and should a rustling sound be heard from
within the structure a death in .the village will
(n.v.) follow. In ordinary circumstances the body
lies undisturbed until the bones and skull are clean :
but in some cases where deceased was an eminent
warrior or philosopher the relatives assist nature
with bamboo knives, and distribute the bones
amongst themselves, the nearest relative taking the
skull, which is hung on the wall of his house.
Although the AYagaia is disgustingly free and easy
with his own skulls, he will under no circumstances
meddle with one of the other fellow’s, and it is
customary and an effective bar to intrusion for a
man when quitting his house for any length of time
to leave his skulls strung across the opening. At
certain periods of the year a form of ritual known
as mamma is enacted, during which the skulls of
the villages, painted with red pigments and befeath-
ered in the orthodox fashion, are carried through the
weird movements of the death dance by women weal-
ing the lower jaws of the skeletons strung around
their necks; the men brandish weapons, and all join
in a sobbing chant to the rhythm of drums and
c-oncli shells and various other instruments of devilry.
I>ill,v Blue’ : Mrs. Bennett's ancient
cockatoo at the Sea Breeze pub at Tom Ugly's Point
(X.S.AA.) had a rival. In January, 1887. a remark-
able bird of the same family died in Phillip-street,
Sydney, being at that time the property of Air. P
A. Hunt. Cocky had been previously in the AA'ent-
worth family, and was there when AV. C. AA'entworth
was a boy. AVhen the fowl died the S. M. Hera no
gave him an obituary notice and was assured there
was plenty of evidence to prove that he had lived
in captivity the best part of a century. Like the
Tom Ugly’s bird ho hadn’t a feather to fly with,
except a small tuft on the end of each wing and on
the neck, and he had also wilted the best part of a
once-copious vocabulary.

THE MOUNTAIN STREAM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
° river that ripples by rushes and roadways,
river that murmurs a threat and a song',
There is sough of the pines in the whip of your
eddies,
there is earth in your tides as you scamper along!
Though you flee to the sea as if demons had chased
you,
And never quite rest in the murk or the morn,
/ know you remember the lair in the Mountains,
The rent in the rock where your ripples were born !
Oh, you may pretend you are kin to the ocean,
Oh, you may pretend that your prize is the sea ;
But I know how you wince at a sail on your surface,
1 know how you yearn just to mirror a tree.
The pines have a lilt that is sorrowful, lonely.
They reach their dark arms o’er the trail of a
stream,
And they lavish the store of their cinnamon needles
To thread their regrets like a sob through a dream.
O river, I know how you feign your forgetting,
M hen the day gilds your bosom with treasure of
noon ;
Or, with make-believe suns in your innocent shal-
lows,
You steal from the planets to mock at the moon,
And spread on the plains in a trick at lagooning
Of something you learned from a mirage asleep—-
A mask for the memory of ridges’ responses,
Or brawling in canyons black shadowed and deep.
A'ou may sweep to the reef at the bar of the harbor,
You ma\ mix with the wave in the-friendliest way,
And the blue sea may welcome with gratified
laughter
The stream that is veined with the ochres of clay;
You may stifle your moan on the breast of the ocean,
And wide as the sky-line your kingdom may be;
But, belted with seaweed and buskined with coral,
You belong to the Mountains though lost in the sea !
And the vague valleys know it, the hill flowers
know it;
Tlie little ferns, lisping, protest to the rills ;
The dry mountain breezes, the hawk-haunted eyries,
The Nearness to God that you left in the hills.
\Y hen I look in the deeps where you ruffle and rumble
Between a sheer gorge to a white pool below,
Though you strive to dissemble in delicate foaming,
I see the earth stain in your sick heart. . . .and know.

She Darkened Her Grey Hair
A Society Lady Darkened Her Grey Hair
and Stimulated its Growth by a
Simple Home Process.
She Telis How She Did It.
A well known society lady who darkened
her grey hair by a simple home process, made
the following statement: “Any lady or gen-
tleman can darken their grey or faded hair,
stimulate its growth and make it soft and
glossy with this simple recipe, which they
can mix at home. To a half-pint of water add
loz. of bay rum, 1 small box of Orlex
Compound and |oz. of glycerine. These in-
gredients can be purchased at any chemist’s
at very little cost. Apply to the hair every
other day until the grey hair is darkened
sufficiently, then every two weeks. This
mixture relieves scalp troubles and is excel-
lent for dandruff and falling hair. It does
not stain the scalp, is not sticky or greasy
and does not rub off. It will make a
grey-haired person look 10 to 20 years
younger.”* [3

"M.E.N.” : As an immigrant he was tip
to sample; as a horseman he was a frost. On the
allegation that he could ride, the boss sent him to
the far paddock for some cows. He returned before
dark, took the bridle off the horse and went into
the shed to hang it up. Of course, when he came
out the moke was over the hill having a feed.
Jimmy came up to a group of us and said in a

“Viking": Asa humble seeker after know-
ledge, I call upon Abo-liars for information. Re-
cently a fine specimen of the fox was caught near
-Nanango (Q,). Though it (or they) had been heard
calling at night, .this was the first beast of the tribe
caught or seen in the district. Hitherto 1 always
thought that envy of Queensland’s pear curse had kept
Reynard out of the Northern State. Can any Abo-
liar truthfully say whether Mr. Yulpes Vulgaris or
his missus has ever been seen farther up on the
map than Nanango?
“THE. NEAR FUTURE."—A frenzied
cartoon, by an inartistic contributor.
“Billybunger”: I was talking to Binghi
the othei day, and asked: “Your father alive yet,
Jaelde?” “No,” he replied hesitatingly; “not yet.”’
** -X- *
“Tiaki” : Knew a man in Maoriland who
giew his own coffin. He was an eccentric who,
when he came to M.L. from England, brought and
planted some oak seed. When the trees had grown
sufficiently he cut them down, sawed them up, and
knocked together a corpse-case. Thirty years later
it was buried, and the cultivator had an inside
berth.
ALWAYS ON THE BULL’S EYE.
ISAACS (who has-enlisted): "Moses, mine friendt, I hare been given a commission!”
MOSES : "Shplendid, Isaacs: shplcnilid mine friendt. Haw much?”
Aneb : “Lou" (R. 15/7/’l5) says that
the practice of breaking horses in a round yard is
g-oing out. It isn't, and it never will. The round
yard is as essential to a large breaking establish-
ment as the trench is in Gallipoli, and for the, same
reason. It gives the owner protection and breathing
space and time to think. Not 5 per cent, of colts
-nowadays buck 4rom~vice,- The cause is fright, with
a little element of pain consequent on having one of
the most sensitive parts (immediately behind the
point of the elbow) pinched. They need" to be' not
so much cowed as quietened. All old hands know
that the “blow-out” busi-
ness is useless for quieting’
a horse. It merely cows
temporarily, leaving the
animal as mannerless as
ever once the fatigue has
worn off. Here are the
chief points in favor of
the round yard. The out-
law can’t hurt himself in
it or injure his rider’s
knees. He can only
twist one way jf he
twists at all (the worst
form of bucking), and the
rider is fully aware of
the only way he can twist
—from the fence. He
cannot buck backwards
(let doubters try to : run
backwards along a oil role
line). Five minutes “on
the bit” in a round yard
will do a lot towards
mouthing a colt,’.but will
blow it out in a big enclo-
sure, and you might as well try to lead a drunk
home without bumping into everything on the wav.
Buckers do not cover much ground in their gvra-
tuons, wherefore a big- enclosure is wasteful. It is
easier to catch a loose horse in a round yard.’ And
lastly, post and rails are scarce and dear, and so is
labor.
The amities were lined up for the medi-
cal examination. Said Micko: “Wot softer doctors
have they got ’ere?” liobbo: “Aw, just a latter
“ civilian doctors.” “Gorstruth! Why don’t the
(*ov ment give us proper doctors ! We do the
figmin’, and they chuck us any thing- that
comes handy. Wet’s a' civilian doctor know
a ion! whether a bloke can scrap or not’” “1
dunno,” said Robbo.
“Barcoo”: The charges against the
Afghan of cruelty to his camels are being overdone.
Having employed numerous Abduls and their ships of
the desert, as well as Australian teams, I ought to
know a bit about the treatment the beasts receive.
Right away, I admit that the white man can g'ive
the black 50 on the slate and beat him easily in 100
up as a camel-handler—points being given for weight of
caigo, despatch, care in handling freight, condition
and tractability of beasts. But I warn the recent con-
tributor who related that he saw Afghans splicing
goat-skin into the broken patch of a dromedary’s:
back that if he doesn’t get medical advice he’ll end
up along the river-banks with a billy-full of pups,
corks round his hat and feathers in his hair.
* * * *
“Clunky” : The crane tribes, less harassed
now by the pea-gun, are increasing along the-
Waranaga (Vic.) channel-ways. In the same coun-
try there is a plague of pink galahs. These birds are
present in flocks of several thousands each. They
tackle the settlers’ fodder crops, especially the newly-
sprouted oats, pulling them up and eating the milky
bulb. Poisoning has been tried with slight success,
but no gunner can get within coo-ee of the birds,
which, incidentally, make real good eating. Where
such immense flocks come from is a mystery. They
have taken the place of the white cockatoo, now
rarely found along the Murray so close to civilisa-
tion. The galah hordes are worse since the rain,
while the native companions, which raised such a
dust scratching up the Restdown settlers’ crops just
before the drought broke, disappeared with the rain
and haven’t been heard from since.

“H.A.” : Here’s a sure answer to “Sammy’s”
question of how to prevent a horse jumping
fences. I , saw it worked on a Queensland cattle
station. The boss took the refractory norvell, drilled
a hole in the end of each ear and tied both flaps
down with a loop of thin rawhide passed round the
animal’s neck. He never jumped again ; but for 12
months you could not touch his head. We had to
jamb him in the crush, put the bridle on him, and
leave it there, simply removing or inserting the bit
as required.- Although the plan worked, the boss
said he would never do it to another horse; but if
“Sammy” likes to try it I’ll charge him nothing
for the recipe.
“Pick”: “Bendigonian” (B. 29/7/’l5)
who classes stringy-bark as the last thing in bad
fuel has evidently not learned that certain woods are
like coal. They can hardly be induced to burn out-
doors, but within a furnace or flrebox they become
a glowing mass, which burns long, and emits great
heat. Gidya, yarran, she-oak, etc., are, on the
other hand, like kerosened cotton waste. They ignite
readily, burn fiercely, and are rapidly consumed to
a white ash, but they give out little heat. The
indecent haste with which they rush through the
job renders those timbers, as fuel, good enough to
singe the fur off thg bandicoot or boil the william,
but utterly useless for the furnace stoker, who yells
for stringy-bark every time.
“Kola”: If anyone wants to see planta-
tions of native trees tell him to come to the Vic.
western country. O n the three-chain road from
Derrinallum there is a chain-wide plantation on each
side for eight miles. It must be fully 25 years old,
and has turned a desolate landscape into a place of
joy. The greatest glory of the plantation is in
spring, when the wattles are in bloom. John
Currie, now dead, who was responsible for it all, has
in these trees his monument. Shaw, of Wooriwyrite,
has a fine plantation, too, and when I pass that wav
on a cold day I remember him and pray for his soul's
peace.
* * * *
Pick”: Anent seagulls. It is because
they , are somewhat weakly fliers that they are some-
times driven inland by stormy weather. In such
case, they volplane for the first patch of moisture
they see. During the strenuous blow that wrecked
the Dandenong off Jervis Bay (N.S.W.) back in the
’7o's, clouds of the birds settled about the fresh-
water lakes on the Mona ro tableland, 70 miles qr
upwards from the coast, and they have frequently-
appeared there since in easterly weather. When they
arrive they usually are so exhausted from battling
against the wind that they may be taken by hand.
They lemain about the lakes until a return of favor-
able weather enables them to respond to the call of
the sea.
THE SUPERIORITY OF THE GERM.
"Adi! Ignorant savage! You put on a
mask to frighten your enemies. I take
one off. See! i am more frightful."
“Tiger”: I thought everybody excepting
G.-G. Ferguson knew how to keep mice out of hay-
stacks. All you have to do is to drive in a few
stakes round the stack, fasten on a length of small-
mesh wire-netting and trench about nine inches into
the ground. On top of the stakes nail fairly wide
strips of tin outwards at an angle of 45 decrees
T. he only way the rodents can get over this is bv
walking backwards up the --netting and throwing a
handspring into the stack/ I have known it to” be
done, but it takes a lot of practice.
> nell : Thacker was the most ardent:
bookloyer I have ever known, and I met him in cir-
cumstances in which literary enthusiasm was least to
. looked for. It had been my turn to do the ten-
mile jaunt from Craddock’s Hand to Beehill for die
weekly allowance of grub, and returning, sweating
under the heat of the day and the burden of a well-
stuffed wheat sack, 1 determined to chance it, and
take Iloppy’s much-vaunted short track across the
Old Howl, cutting off two and a half miles. I was
no great bushman, and when the wheel-track was half
an hour behind I came reluctantly to the conclusion
that, I was bushed in rough, unmarked gum country.
It was shortly after this I struck Thacker’s humpy.
It was of stringy-bark, had a canvas door stretched on
a frame > and a slab chimney, but possessed a real
g*ass window. In the window were three tiers of
shelves filled with tattered books, and along the side
of the hut hung two smooth slabs on which was
painted with tar: “Thacker’s Second-hand Book-'
s lop. Books Bought.” I dropped my bundle and
knocked on the window. Receiving no reply I opened
the door. The hut was practically lined with book-
shelves constructed of split palings, and the shelves
were full of books. Thacker certainly had a large
and varied stock. The proprietor arrived from a
fencing job, somewhat breathless, visibly perturbed,
while I was looking around me. “Here, hete,
.vou up to?” said Thacker. “Breaking into a man’s
shop. What do you mean?” Thacker was a small,
strongly-built man with profuse, curling hair and'
multitudinous curling whiskers. Even his eyebrows
cm ed Having apologised for my intrusion, ex-
plained my lost condition, and received minute direc-
tions, I offered to do business. “I would like a
couple of good novels,” I said. Thacker seemed
leiuctant. “Have you got any to sell?” he asked.
1 hadnt, but picked out two G. H. Wells volumes.
, ow much?” I asked. Thacker shook his head.
1 m afraid 1 can’t sell those,” lie said. ..i“Thev're-
promised,” he added with the enthusiasm of Ifie
drowning man who clutches a straw. - I tried a
Hardy and a Kipling. Those were not for sale, un-
fortunately. I eventually got away with “The
Son-ows of Satan” and “The Red Badge of Courage.”
But Thacker was most reluctant. “If you had any
to sell I d be glad to do business with 3'ou,” he
said. He accompanied me for a mile, pretending to
inect me, but really in the hope of recovering his
books. That night, at about 12, I awoke, feeling
certain I had seen a man duck out of the tent.
Hoppy, my tent-mate, abused me with viperish
bitterness when I disturbed his rest to comment on
he possibilities. But my senses had not deceived
me. In the morning 1 found that “The Sorrows”
and “The Red Badge” had disappeared. Thacker
had stolen them back.

Actually a trifle more profit than usual last
half-year! Twelve months ago this little
hank, which confines itself to Ballarat, owed
£237.150 —all but £43,000 of it held on
fixed deposits—and it had £108,413 of
liquid assets. In view of the trifle of cur-
rent account money for which the bank was
liiible, the liquid holding was on the large
side ; so it was possible for the management
to give its clients a little further help during
the year. Hence, though deposits and other
liabilities are down a few thousands,
advances are up a few thousands. And
that accounts for the trifle of extra profit.
The co. now owes to depositors, etc.,
£234.259, and still lias £97,265 in liquid
assets; so the position is quite secure. And
it is all the more secure because the bank
owes -so little in proportion to its capital
and reserves —only about 275. Gd. for every
£1 of its own funds. With so little public
money to play with big profits are out of
the question. On the other hand, given fair
management, the risks are very small. Many
a big bank’s capital and reserves have to
protect advances and other risks five times
greater than the funds themselves. In this
hank £173,730 of shareholders’ funds have
to protect only £311,533 of advances.

The profits are not at any time positively
big; but they are very big compared with
the capital. The co. was born when the
\\ estern (N.S.W.) coal trade was under a
cloud. There were many small producers
who fought for the little trade that was
going—mostly railway contracts. The
profits were so small and Newcastle’s posi-
tion was so commanding that no Western
mine was valued at more than a few thou-
sands. Then came the Litligow Coal Asso-
ciation, to handle all the output of all the
W estern mines of any consequence, followed
by the industrial development of Litligow
and the extension of railways in the West.
On these changes this and other cos. began
lo pay rattling dividends and bonuses ou
their small capital. Less than three years
ago the capital was £45.000. Bonus shares
of one for three were then issued, so that
the present dividend really means much
more than 10 p.c. Meantime £7500. profit
made on the sale of land at Eskbank, has
been distributed. Further, though the
profits for the past 12 months have
apparently been only £7BlO, what may be
called the cash position has improved as
follows:—-
_. ~ June, T 4. June,’ls.
Liquid assets .. ..£27,086 £34,264
Liabilities .. .. 1,857 3,119
Surplus liquid assets ..£25,229 £31,145
Thus, though the co. has paid its 10 p.c.
dividend and 124 p.c. bonus, there is close
upon £(>000 more in hand than was there
12 months ago, the whole of it and more
represented by money on deposit. Maybe
a trifle of this represents property sold and
wear and tear not provided for by replace-
ment ; at the same time it indicates that the
W estern mines are still on a wonderfully
good wicket.

After the year the North lias come
through, the figures in the last line are a
pleasant surprise. The severity of Queens-
land’s drought, coming on top of , the dislo-
cation brought about by the war, must have
cut into the commission payable on the
earnings of trust estates. Yet the co. can
pay the usual div. and still show a lay-by
of £2oos—the second largest in sight. Oil
top of that its trust estates in hand have
for the first time got past the £3.000.000
mark, and now stand at £3,382,095. com-
pared with £2,991,278 12 months ago, and
£1.408,230 at June, 1900 —proof of a mag-
nificent growth of business and an assur-
ance of substantial revenue for a good many
years to come. As to the position of share-
holders. liabilities amount to £7229, against
which there is £20,100 on Treasury deposit,
£4170 of liquid assets, and £25,268 in
premises, which have only recently been
remodelled and occupied. Paid capital is
£25,250, equal to ss. per share, and the
reserves represent another 3s. Od. As for
clients and future clients, they are protected
against the consequences of wrong-doing
not only by that paid capital and reserve,
but also by £176,000 of uncalled capital.
And they are protected by something better
even than that —the special training of the
staff and the fact that the co.’s future
depends upon the satisfaction it gives in
this particular business. The private
trustee, who doesn’t depend upon trusteeing
for a living, can make a horrible mess of
that side-line and suffer not at all. It
isn’t surprising therefore if he gives it the
mere rags and tags of his attention.

The new coaster that was talked about has
been deferred. War, of course, and high
costs. Australia, you see, can’t build ships
of its own: it is a mere wood and water
joey. So, when war broke out, the building
of ships in Europe for Australia and other
helpless places was out of the question;
wherefore travellers to Newcastle have their
choice- —one of the co.’s uninviting old arks
or train. Yet if there is a place in Australia,
which would benefit more than another by a
tremendous increase in home industries,
that place is Newcastle. It ought to lead
the whole Commonwealth in the yell for Aus-
tralian manufactures, big and little.
This co. can't plead that it owes nothing
to Newcastle. Look at the financial posi-
tion and the movement in the past five
years:—
June, June, Dec., June,
1910. 1914. 1914. 1915.
Slap property . . £76,862 £46,475 £43,192 £40,313
Freeholds, etc. .. 2,723 1,357 1,357 1,157
Plant, etc. .. 5,032 3,297 3,166 2,62 S
Liquid assets .. 34,266 82,065 91,230 96,523
The capital is only £lOO,OOO, and of that and
the co.’s reserves no less than £90,523 is
liquid, including £68,000 in the bank and
£13.000 of Treasury bills. By the end of
1915 the co. should have in the safe more
than the entire paid capital. There are few
industrials in Australia offering such good
security. On the other hand, there may not
be many companies that would permit of the
money they put up for shipping purposes
going into bank deposits at 34 p.c. or so;
but possibly the directors are preparing for a
big forward move. Meanwhile note that in
five years, after paying out that divi-
dend and providing for all liabilities,
the co. has increased its liquid assets
from £00.077 to £87,181. This may
possibly have been due in a small mea-
sure to the realisation of assets; yet the
])resent assets are evidently earning more
money than those which the co. held five
years ago. Also there has been live years'
wear and tear; but it wouldn’t take £57,000
to counterbalance that. Pretty plainly the
co. has been doing very much better than
its 0 and 7 p.c. dividends would lead one to
suppose.
The sort of thing that is liable to happen
when a bad slump follows a worse boom is
illustrated by the Hotel Australia. In 1892
Sydney’s biggest pub. stood in the books at
cost or under —£202,982. Then the boom
broke, and in 1895 £115,000 was written off
the property and £13,000-odd off etceteras.
The £128.000 represented approximately the
whole share capital, and the English mort-
gagees took possession. They carried the
business on till four or five years ago, when
an Australian co. bought ,1. Bull out. With
the object of restoring some of the capital
which was written off and other money
which has been put into the business out of
profits, the co. is being reconstructed as
lately set out. here (B. 22/7/’l5). How, in
the dull times ahead, the new co. is going lo
fare with its enlarged capital is probably
causing the directors some concern. A wages
bill of £25.000 a year takes a bit of earn-
ing.

The average yield of gold per ton in
various Victorian districts during 1914 was:
Bendigo, G.ffdwt.; Ballarat, 5.2dwt.; Oastle-
maine, 10.9dwt.; Ararat and Si a well,
3.5dwt.; and Gippsland, 12.5dwt. The
average yield per ton for all Victoria since
records became authentic was 9.sdwt.
48,000,000 tons for 22,897,39.1 oz.
Troubles were the outstanding feature of
Great Fingall’s year. The accounts show
that, after debiting expenditure on develop-
ment, cost of, testing options, etc., there was
a loss of £24,8(50. This result is attributed
to exceptional outlay in coping with a
treacherous hanging wall, which rendered
the extraction of ore difficult and expensive.
This and other misfortunes nullified all
efforts to make the mine pay ; and. according
to chairman Moreing, nobody knows when it:
will pay. Ore reserves below No. 13 level are
estimated at 63,300 tons, assaying 355. 3d.
Strenuous attempts arc being made to
get at the ore exposed below No. 18 level,
but a grave doubt exists as to whether the
funds in hand are sufficient. A winze re-
cently sunk from 01 ft. to 159 ft. below No.
18 level went down in ore averaging from
60s. to 955. per ton, and tin* average in the
bottom is reported as 71s. This is the deep-
est point yet reached.

The Royal Commission
in their final report on Tuberculosis,
recently issued, clearly showed that
the chief danger to child life resulted
from the use of infected cow’s milk.
To quote one extract : “The Evi-
dence we have accumulated goes to
demonstrate that a considerable
amount of the tuberculosis of child-
hood is to be ascribed to infection
transmitted to children in meals
consisting largely of tne milk of
the cow.”
When the mother’s milk is not
available, the “Allenburys” Foods
form the best substitute, as they are
practically identical with healthy human milk
in composition, nutritive value and digestibility,
and are absolutely free from all harmful germs.
Milk Food No. I. From birth to 3 months
Milk Food No. 2. From 3to 6 mon hs
Malted Food No. 3. From 6 months upwards

Rusks are specially useful during the
troublesome time of teething. When
eaten raw they mechanically aid the

“Eddyson's” tale of a hero who didn t
wear khaki
“’Twas a rare fine deed iv John McConochie s, said
Flynn, “and got him the medal for the privintion iv
■croolty to animals. ’Twas jue to a tirrible accident et
the Ace iv Shpades mine et The Tip beyant, whin the
roof iv a drive come in, ’n’ Tom Cosgrove was thiap-
ped like a rabbit. This was on afther wan iv the
mornin’, ’n’ all the whistles iv the five mines was
turned full cock, ’n’ brung min from hell ’n every-
where. McConochie was in the first flight, ’n he
come in among the little knot iv b’ys be the mouth
iv the shaft, bullheaded, ’n’ ‘What is it all, at all,
sez he, ‘that ye’re shtandin’ here like wilted
candles?' he sez. 4 ’Tis the min drive fell in,’ sez
Curtain, ’ n’ a man down,’ sez he. ‘Not Tommy
Cosgrove?’ sez McConochie. Curtain nods his head.
‘ ’Tis so,’ sez he. ‘ ’N’ for whoi ’re ye not diggin
the man out ?’ sez he. ‘Hell t’ yer souls, dig the
man out!’ he sez. 4 ’Tis easy t’ shtand here, ’n’
make great conversation,’ sez Curtain, the boss iv
the shift, ‘but wid the roof shtill dhroppin’ flakes
iv reef big as a house,’ he sez, ‘the diggin’ out iv
Tommy Cosgrove is a matther fer serious considera-
tion, him a small bit iv a man, a dthrinker, ’n’ an
Orangeman et the best.’ Wid that John McConochie
is losin’ his nut. ‘Ye’ll dig the man out!’ sez he.
‘Come on, is there a man among ye? Morgan, yeh
scut, if yeh don’t take a shovel ’n’ lade the way
into that cage I’ll pick a hole in yer head ye’ll see
the moon troo. Jacka, folly him! Folly him, will
yeh, ’r must a man bate yeh ’n’ befure yer own ould
womun, too? Quinn, ’tis you next. Now, Curtain,
ve’re boss here, man, but if yeh loiter I’ll do ye a
mischief wid me hammer, I will.’ Well, such js
the timper iv the man, they all filed silent in the
cage, ’n’ John jined thim, pulled the knocker line,
’n’ down they wirt. ’Twas a great shtruggle, I m
told, ’n’ Morgan took a break to his elbow, n’
Stevens was harmed wid a flake iv reef th’ size iv
a barrer ebippin’ a hunk frim his shkull; but they
got Tommie Cosgrove out; ’n’ that widin’ , three
hours. Tommie was on’y ha’f buried, ’n was
breathin’, though hurted to such an ixtint he was
not acquaint wid the procession iv ivents., They
put him in the cage, ’n’ tuck him on top, n fiim
there he was humped to his home, poor man, Mrs.
Cosgrove follyin’ afther ’n’ wailin thriminjis. They
put Tommy t’ bed, ’n’ wrapped up a few iv his
hurts, ’n’ give him whisky outside ’n’ in, ’n’ ’twas
soon ivident Cosgrove was doin’ well enough. ’Twas
not till tliis moment John McConochie lave go iv
the full managemint iv affairs. All through he’d
bin a man braced up wid a great inwar-rd con-
viction, ’n’ goin’ like a racin’ ingine the whole
while, mind vch. Now the docthor was come, ’n
McConochie was lavin’ afther the others, ’n’ he gave
Mrs. Cosgrove a pull aside, ’n’ he sez behint his
hand, sez he: ‘Yer man is all right, ma’am. Whisper:
when he’s free frim his onconsciousness would yeh
kindly remind him iv the wan pound fifteen sliillin
he had of me Chewsdee's a fortnit?’ ”
The English High Court has just decided
that there is copyright in a list of railway
stations or residents in a suburban street.
One of the London weeklies that go in for
“guessing competitions” used for this pur-
pose a list of railway stations copied from
"Bradshaw’s Guide.” The proprietors of the
latter sought an injunction with damages
and got both, the penalty being £5O and costs.
The High Court held that the compilation ot
such a list was a work of expense, entitled
to protection under the provisions ot the
Copyright Act. “Without any exertion ot
their own the defendants got the benefit ot
the labor of compiling the list, and they
reproduced it for a profit.” It is common-
sense, even though it does recall the remark
of Augustine Birrell, who, speaking once on
a Copyright Bill in the House of Commons,
said that such publications as guides and
directories represent “shoe-leather not lit-
erature.”
It is reported that the Eighth Infantry
Brigade, now being assembled and licked
into shape by Colonel Tivey, is to get
“thorough musketry training.’ It sounds
as though the Eighth is. to have something
quite unusual put on its plate. Expedi-
tionaries of earlier drafts were to be seen
learning ceremonial drill amongst the tar-
gets. Probably that part has been found
to be in little demand at Gallipoli.
The Bulletin never knows what it is
going to be asked next. The other day
a brawny master-gunner from a weather-
beaten auxiliary cruiser called and asked
where he and his fighting-men could find a
meenister to preach them a comforting ser-
mon in Gaelic on the following Sabbath —
the first they had had ashore for many weary
months. The good Scots, who belong to the
naval reserve, didn’t want English, because
the onlv English they could speak or under-
stand was the sort their guns used. And
how good it was let the Dresden testiij .
The eminent surgeon, Sir Frederick
Treves, the leader of the profession in Eng-
land for 15 years past, gave a handsome
reference to Australia after a _ recent visit
to No. 1 general hospital at Heliopolis under
Col. Ramsay Smith, of South Aus. In a
letter to that officer he said: —
Australia may well be' proud of the part she has
played in this war, and I can pay no higher compli-
ment than by saying that the medical arrangement*
of the Australian army are as splendid as are the
fighting qualities of the men.. . .The generosity with
which Australia has provided motor-ambulances tor
the whole country and Red Cross stores for every one,
British or French, who has been in want of the same
is beyond all words. I only hope the people of Aus-
tralia will come to know of the splendid manner in
which their wounded have been cared for, and of the
noble and generous work done under the banner of
the Red Cross.
The proclaiming of the Lamington
Plateau, 75 miles from Brisbane, as a
National Park is a wise step on the part of
the Government. Embracing an area of
nearly 50,000 acres, the tableland contains
noble scenery in upland, fell, stream, cata-
ract and plain, with patches of superb
forest. Preserved as Nature made it, it will
be a glorious heritage for future generations.

“ON THE HOP.”—A superb library
volume, containing over 300 of
“Hop’s” best drawings. Price 21/-,
from “The Bulletin” Office, Sydney.
Don’t let ill-health
cloud your life.
Here is an offer of new health and new
life to all who are
Weak, Anaemic,
“Nervy,” “Run-down.”
Get well the “Wincarnis” way
—the quick, sure and safe way
to new and vigorous health.
Tiie Quick way —because the
benefit begins from the first
iL'ineglassful, and increases
with every additional wine-
glassful. The Sure way —be-
cause it has given new health
and new life to countless
thousands of sufferers. And
because it is recommended by
over 10,000 Doctors. The Safe
way —because it is the only
Wine Tonic of any repute that
does not contain drucjs.
The first effect of “Wincatnis”
is an immediate stimulation
and invigoration of the whole
system. This is followed by
an actual up-building of bodily
vigor—an up-building that you
can feel —and which gives you
more strength and vitality
than you had before. And
each succeeding wineglassful
of “Wincarnis” creates still
more strength and still more
vitality, until soon your whole
body thrills with new health
and new life.
Then you can stop taking
“Wincarnis.”
But you still enjoy to the full the gloruus
new health it has given you. That is where
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaA-a^aA
mm
M
f y rryvyrytvyyf t v rm
proves itself of enormous ad- I
vantage over drugs and j
drugged wines. Drugs stimu-
late, it is true; but it is false
stimulation. And drags make
you feel worse afterwards, be-
cause they depress the heart.
Eead what Mr. Edmunds says:
<‘Dear Sirs, I am delighted
with the new health your
world-famed ‘Win earn is’ has
given me. T have had such a
busy season that I got ‘run
down.’ I was intensely weak
and quickly got exhausted. I
was' induced to take a wine
tonic, which unfortunately
made me feel worse than ever.
I discovered afterwards that it
contained drugs. So I quickly
gave it up and tried ‘Win-
carnis’ instead. And it is won-
derful how speedily 'Win -
carnis' has made me feel a dif-
ferent being. It seemed to put
new life into me. I should
never have believed that any-
thing could do me so much
good, or do it as quickly as
‘Wincarnis’ has done. 1 only
wish 1 had tried it before.
—Yours faithfully, A. S.
Edmunds, 8112 Selwyn Road,
Cliftonville.” So you see that
the health that “Wincarnis”
gives is real and lasting health.
That is the health you want if
you suffer from Anaemia,
Weakness, Nerves, Sleepless-
ness, Exhaustion, Indigestion
or if you are “Run down.”
And it is real and lasting health
that “Wincarnis” offers you.
Will you try just one bottle?
Begin to get well TO-DAY.
“Wincarnis” is made in England by COLEMAN & CO., LID.,
Wincarnis Works, Norwich. Yon. can buy “Wincarnis” from
all Chemists and Stores selling wines, prices 4/- and 6/6, but if
you experience any difficulty in obtaining it, write direct to the

Have You Had luflueaza?
There are certain disorders such as influ-
enza that especially debilitate and make
the body an easy prey for more dangerous
diseases. Ask those who have had the influ-
enza regarding the present condition of
their health and most of them will answer.
“Since I had influenza I have never been
well.” They still have profuse perspiration,
the persistent weakness of the limbs, the
disorganised digestion, shortness of breath
and palpitation of the heart caused by the
thin-blooded condition in which influenza
almost always leaves its victim after the
fever and influenza has subsided. ihey are
furthermore at the mercy of relapses and
complications, often very serious. In an
attack of influenza there is a rapid thinning
of the blood, and not until the blood is built
up again is complete health restored.
Dr? Williams’ Pink Pills quickly make
the blood rich and red, drive out the linger-
ing germs from the system, and transform
despondent influenza victims into cheerful,
healthy men and women.
Try the pills for any form of debility
caused by thin blood.

How to Avoid Sick Headache
Many people suffer at regular intervals
from sick headache. Generally they can tell
hours in advance when an attack is coming
on. The trouble is caused by accumulation
of poison in the digestive organs, and when
a certain point is reached this poison pro-
duces nausea and the attack follows.
If sufferers would take a _ dose of 1 mk-
ettes, the new laxative, at intervals, these
distressing attacks may be avoided. 1 mk-
ettes are dainty little, sugar-coated ovals
that arouse no feeling of repulsion, and they
act so gently that they are the ideal laxa-
tive to use in correcting a tendency to sick
headache. They have no unpleasant effect
to make them objectionable to the extra-
sensitive sick-headache patient. Old-fash-
ioned harsh purgatives will not do at all in
such cases. If you would like to try them,
send for a free sample to the Dr. Williams
Medicine Co., Sydney, mentioning that you
read of them in The Bulletin. Sold every-
where, Is. per bottle.*

POLITICAL
POINTS
.p-here is too much “Go!” and not enough
‘Come!” about this recruiting campaign.
The S. Aus. Leg. Council, having had
fhe startling experience of losing bv death
three members out of 20 within a week —
Addison, John Downer and Klauer—is
bkely to have the vacancies filled without
any fights. As a matter of fact, all three
seats are fairly sure, the first tw*o for
Liberals and the third for Labor, and a
truce is the obvious thing in the circum-
stances. Addison’s Northern seat is to be
taken by Morrow, Victorian by birth, a
-Brisbane boy in the ’Bo’s, but for the past
“V 3 r ears of Port Pirie (S.A.), where he has
had. the thrilling experience of having a
casting-vote, as mayor, on a town council
evenly divided between Lib. and Lab.
The Melbourne City Council’s objection to
i the payment of members of the Greater Mel-
■ bourne Council is allegedly based on economy,
(hough nothing dearer than the services gratis
of the ancient patriots of the Council is
possible. And though ex-Town Clerk Clay-
ton is a very ordinary little man, and lias
been paid a more than ordinary salary for
merely routine service, the very economical
Council handed him £lBOO as a companion
in retirement. After that the Council
decided to move the barrow hawkers of fruit
and fish another block or two west of the
traffic, so that the people who want to prac-
tise economy may find it more difficult to do
so. And then ii snored again.
IN TOPHET.
THE GUIDE: “ ’Sit! This is poor old Dio-
genes, doomed to eternal disappoint-
ment."
THE SHADE: “Why! What’s he searching
for now?”
THE GUIDE: “An honest reason why Britain
should not adopt conscription.”
The new offices for the Education Depart-
ment in Sydney, begun three years ago, have
thus far cost £117,000 instead of the esti-
mated £8.1,092; and, as the building is ex-
pected to be finished next month, there are
hopes that the estimate will not be exceeded
altogether by more than 50 per cent. Norton
Griffiths (who have begun to draw commis-
sion on the North Coast railway) could
hardly do more, even though the inducement
is held out to them of a 5 per cent, cut out
of anything extra that they can make a job
cost.
Some ill-regulated humorists have been
posting notices on building works in progress
in Melbourne advising the toilers engaged to
“Join the I.W.W. and go slow. Slow work
means more jobs; more jobs means less un-
employed, and that means higher wages.” It
is all strictly logical, of course; and in an
ideal I.W.W. State every worker would toil
leisurely at stupendous wages for about half
an hour a day. Meanwhile the I.W.W. ora-
tors ought to explain how it is that the
sudden withdrawal of over 100,000 able-
bodied workers from the Australian labor
market has not meant more jobs and less
unemployed—-why the withdrawal has not
made billets plentiful and billet-hunters as
scarce as .I.W.W. pamphleteers in Berlin,
As there will be no Liberal candidate for
the Willoughby (N.S.W.) State seat made
vacant by the Turkish bullet which found
“Teddy” Larkin, the candidate selected by
the local Labor League, and endorsed by the
Central Executive, will be able to look upon
himself as an M.L.A. Naturally, therefore,
there is a rush for the job. If the selection
was decided by members of the League alone,
either G. M. Downs or Captain Bradley
would be chosen; but the League has only a
hundred members, and the tramway men liv-
ing in the district, who can vote as members
of a union affiliated with the P.L.L., will
carry the day. So Harding, who has been
a useful member of the executive of the
Tram-men’s Union, will probably get the
necessary votes when the ballot is taken on
August 30. It is in such fashion that the
country is provided with its statesmen.
Victoria’s Land Purchase and Mismanage-
ment Board ceases to exist at the end of
August, and the Closer Settlement Act will
be temporarily administered by a Board of
Lands Department officials until the Peacock
Government can decide what it is going to
do. It has not yet announced its attitude
towards the report of the Closer Settlement
Commission; but if it adopts all of the Com-
mission’s recommendations, there won’t be
much more closer settlement. The Commis-
sion reckons that the maximum value of an
allotment should be - increased to £4OOO, that
a deposit of 10 per cent, should be required
from each settler, and that the Government
should “abandon the principle of providing
for those not financially strong.” Appar-
ently the Commission labors under the delu-
sion that the object of the Act is to provide
an outlet for squatters’ surplus capital. An-
other recommendation is the abolition of
Clause 150, which requires a settler to live
upon his land for at least eight months in
the year. The Commission’s idea seems to be
that when the squatter has paid his £4OO
deposit and taken up his £4OOO block, he
should be entitled to sub-let it and play the
part of absentee landlord. Yet the abolition
ot landlordism was understood to be one of
the objects of Closer Settlement.
Now there is a fair promise of a record
wheat harvest, the farmer finds that the
orders lie is sending
to Calcutta for bags
are only accepted
subject to “ability to
execute,” the Im-
perial war authori-
ties having notified the
mill-owners that war
orders for hessian
must take precedence
of all other business.
If the Fisher Gov-
ernment had carried
out its election
promises and given
the Commonwealth a
genuinely protective
tariff, the jute for
the bags the farmer
wants would have
been in the Common-
wealth long before
now, and the bags
would have been
awaiting delivery.
Incidentally this
would have allowed
the Calcutta mills to
devote their whole
energies to the Im-
perial war require-
ments. The Austra-
lian farmer might
have had to pay a
trifle more for his
bags, but at least
Australia would have
retained the money
which it will have to
send away to pay
foreign labor and
make foreign mill-
owners’ profits. And
Australia has no
money to spare just
now to pay foreign
labor and fatten for-
eign mill-owners. It
wants all it has to buy tucker for its own!
Referring to war debt a Sydney daily
remarks that happily Australia entered the
war with a clean sheet. What about the
other sheet showing the lOU—three hun-
led millions or so of it, piled up in spite
or constant warnings that the time would
come when the country would have to bor-
row or burst?

Prime Minister Fisher, in his financial
statement last week, casually remarked that
he “must mention the undoubted difficulties
which have arisen out of the position of Aus-
tralia, with six State Governments each
piling up _ separate national debts.” But
why mention such a trfling difficulty? Are
State Rights not sacred things? And is
it not one of the privileges of a sovereign
State to “encourage the flow of foreign capi-
tal” and pawn its soul in the process if it
wants to?
“GOING, GOING ”
“Bid up, gentlemen, bid up—the highest
bidder is the huger."
Yawn Murray lias become Minister of
Labor in place of Peacock. It recalls tlie
comment of a Parliamentary cynic when a
new Vic. Ministry was being formed.
“Blank’s been given Education,” he was
told. “Well, Blank needed it,” was the
reply.
Australia has seven Parliaments of two
branches apiece, with Speakers, Black Bods,
Sergeants-at-Arms, and multitudinous other
well-fed officials. It also has six Governors
(imp.) and a Governor-General (imp.), vari-
ous residences and buildings to keep in
repair, and sitting on its chest the anomaly
called Party Government. The cost of all
this accumulated Parliament and Speaker
and Governor and Black Rod was last year
£725,265, including £lBO per week for re-
freshment rooms and £9OO per week for run-
ning llansakos. Every day of the week
the Australian taxpayer finds £2OOO for keep-
ing Parliaments and Governors going, and
between drinks he is bound to hear some
politician shouting about “economy” !
After raising the current £20,000,000 war
loan, the Commonwealth will still have to
find another £20,000,000 to provide for the
year’s expenditure. At any rate, that is
the forecast, though as the outlay will in
all probability be greater than the estimate
and the revenue will most likely shrink like
a cheap shirt at the laundry, the gaping
void may require an even more substantial
filling. Prime Minister Fisher speaks of
pledging the credit of the country at home
or in London. This is for purposes of war.
Meantime, to get cash to “blew” on the
local railway and culvert and the coat of
paint for the police station, six other Gov-
ernments are hard at work reducing the
credit of the country on which the main-
tenance of the war is based. Do they really
do it from choice or are they paid to do it?
Happy Jack Scaddan, becoming communi-
cative in the Westralian Assembly the other
evening, announced that the State’s trading
concerns showed a net profit of £20,195 for
the 12 months to the end of June. The
trouble about statements of this kind is that
trading concerns can show just about what-
ever profit the man who makes the state-
ment wants them to. Immediately before
the big boom burst in Victoria there were
banks that showed .such fat profits that they
paid 15 per cent, dividends. Then a horrified
Board looked in an empty till one morning
and forgot to open the doors that day;
and in a month or two shareholders discov-
ered that, instead of making the obese profits,
the bank had lost two-thirds of all the capi-
tal it ever had, and in a few cases more than
all it ever had. Westralia has an Auditor-
General who knows his business. If he says
the State concerns made a net profit of
£20.195 Westralia can pretty. safely believe
it. If lie doesn’t, then somebody had better
ask Scaddan what is the difference between
getting Ministerial pay by false pretences
and getting anv other sort of money by the
same means.
lieady, the Tasmanian Senator who
lately committed the sacrilege of demanding
ia Parliament that the Argus should be
suppressed, is a volatile young man
from whom more may be heard when the
leaders of his party have retired to slippers
and arm-chairs. Lately Ready has been
investigating the remount scandal, and his
discoveries have been such as to cause cer-
tain dealers -in six States to watch him with
interest, not to say anxiety.
Lloyd George has assured Britain that its
output of shells and other warlike hardware
will be a hundred times greater in Septem-
ber, 1915, than it was in September, 1914.
Could any reflection on the Asquith Govern-
ment of a year ago be more awful! Kitch-
ener proposed to raise an army on a three
years’ engagement. In the diary of one
of the first German officers captured was the
critical observation: “This, as I expected, is
going to be an artillery war.” Yet Britain
was producing only 1 per cent, of her pro-
jected army’s necessary equipment of can-
nons and the material for stoking them!
Can any decent Australian who realises
the extent of the national indebtedness and
the enormous burden of debt and taxation
the war is heaping on the nation, look with -
out dismay at loan expenditure by the State
Governments on undertakings which are
not immediate necessities? No one can pre-
tend that an undertaking like the City rail-
way (Sydney) is at such a time anything
but a scandalous diversion of money. The
rail communication may be the best; but
this is a time when we must do without a
lot of bests and put up with second
bests. Next after the pursuit of this war
with an energy worthy of the race, the job
for this country is production—production
and still more production. The withdrawal
of men from production to build a railway
which merely supplants a tramway is a
crime against the Commonwealth and the
Empire.
After war commenced the Commonwealth
Government entered into a compact to lend
the States £15,000,000, and of this sum
£12,000,000 has already been advanced. In
the interval the monster of war has been
growing so ravenous that the job of rais-
ing enough to feed the brute lias, become the
world’s biggest problem. Yet the cost of
Government in Australia, instead of being
reduced, is growing; large expenditure is
proceeding and is contemplated in direc-
tions having no relation to the war. Almost
every State is still frantically reaching out
for more loan and administering its affairs
as if the bloat and the boom were still on
the premises, and meantime over a hundred
thousand men have been diverted from pro-
ductive industry to the colors. We are not
merely burning an already abbreviated candle
at both ends. The tallow is being also held
right on top of the fire, and the sizzling
drip can be heard from Canberra to
Broome.
A MATTER OF MOISTURE.
All the speakers advocated the establishment of
a wet canteen at the camp. —Press item.
“Never mind about a wet canteen, sir. What
we want is a dry camp!”
Feeling already the axe of the Greater
Melbourne County Council at its tail, the
ancients who drivel in the Melbourne City
Council bare invented a prop to suppori
their falling dignity. The Town Hall is to
have a new name—possibly City Hall, which
is right enough, but more probably Mansion
House. Sooner or later that would carry
residence for the purely ornamental mayor.
No doubt they think this is very English :
but the habit of putting another tassel on
the burgomaster is really very German.
WARSAW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Hie Mazur to the Pole gave plate
When Sigismund was lord,
And Time strove gently to efface
The bloodstains from his sword ;
Peace built a kingdom for Unrest,
As song-birds build a cuckoo’s nest,
And soon to Warsaw’s bruised breast
The red stain was restored.
O hapless Warsaw, born to grief I
Her saviour comes not yet!
The puissant, canting Teuton thief
Shall make her toil and sweat;
The pressure of a brutal thumb
Shall hurt, ere smiling Freedom come
With flying flag and roll of drum
To teach her to forget.
VICTORIA.

ITCHING PILES CURED.
Mr. Joseph Abrahams, 25 Bourke Street, Red fern,

Itching Piles. The pain and irritation of this ailment
are terrible, and only those who have suffered know
what an awful complaint it is. I used dozens of pile
remedies, but could not get anything to give me ease.
I never expected to get a cure for piles. A friend
urged me to try Doan’s Ointment, saying he was sure
this preparation would cure me. I got some, and
commenced using it. and in a very short time I was
completely cured. I shall be pleased to personal!v
verify this should any sufferer call on me.” Doan’s

SCONE RESIDENT STILL ENJOYS
GOOD HEALTH.
“I was under several doctors for many
years and subsequently that of a local
chemist, but little or no improvement was
noticeable in my complaint,” writes Mr.
George Newman, of Kelly Street, Scone,
N.S.W. “I commenced with Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills after all this treatment
owing to a Scotch friend’s intervention. I
might say my kidneys were the trouble, and
the discharge of blood caused me to be
alarmed prior to taking up your remedy. I
am thankful to say that almost twenty-six
years ago this happened, and after under-
going a course of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills I have never been subject to this
malady since, and therefore consider myself
absolutely cured of my former trouble with
the kidneys, and feel that I am only re-echo-
ing the testimony of thousands in asserting
what this remedy has done in my case.
You have my full consent to use this evi-
dence for publication, and should anyone
call I can further substantiate same. I am
a resident of Scone for fifty-six years and

SPORTING
NOTIONS
One of the finest samples of what one may
can war Snuffle was contributed last week by . the
president of the Suburban and Country Golf Associa-
tion (.N.S.W.). After calling upon the Government
st „°P football, pony-racing and the business at
the Stadium in order to make young men reflect
upon their sacred duty,” he proceeded to outline the
proper course of conduct for the patriotic golfer.
He did not urge that the golfers should stop, much
less that they should be stopped, playing. Merely
the advisability of discontinuing the publication
ot any golf fixtures or results of same in the news-
papers until the termination of the war.” This is
an admirable arrangement from the point- of view of
the countless young golfers who may be seen per-
il111??.11®' , dail y on f |le links. It provides them with
ad the diversion and none of the undesirable adver-
tisement. They will be in a position to play by
stealth, and not blush to find it sliame in the
sporting columns of the daily papers the next morn-
ing. . IV by football should be stopped and not
tenms; why pony racing and not horse racing;
and why boxing and not juggling aaid acrobatic

"Trotter”: The father of Ilulton Sams,
Queensland s “fighting parson,” was a vicar in
Buckinghamshire, who boxed successfully three times
for Cambridge against Oxford,- and beat the Marquis
ot Queensberry, the author of the celebrated rules.
Ilulton. as a lightweight, won for Oxford against
Cambridge, and was lightweight Midland champion
at the time he left for Queensland.
The late Robert Gardner, who died at
Launceston on July 30, left £2OOO. to encourage rifle
shooting by clubs in Tassy. The interest is to he
apportioned for prizes. Since 1892 he annually gave
the Launceston Club its prize of £lO 10s. for the
winner of the season’s aggregate of, matches. By
doing this he reckoned he was paying a small pre-
mium for the best assurance citizens could have for
their safety, and, considering the lesson that has
been daubed in blood over Europe, even a l>a Id-

Battleship, by winning the Australian
Steeplechase, made this journal’s horse reporters feel
better. Of the 17 starters for the four-mile event The
Bulletin had mentioned only seven, and six of
these were in the first seven when the end came.
The race lasted Bmin. lsee. For nearly all that time
the backers of Booiigal experienced pleasurable excite-
ment for . their oof. The big, honest dasher soon
rushed to - the - front with his J2st. 51b. burden, and
there he stayed until everything bar Battleship was
suffering from tired feeling. Torone looked like
outstaying Booiigal when they were clearing the last
of the 24 jumps ; but before they entered the straight
the big topweight had re-asserted his authority over
the Sydney horse, and it only remained for Battle-
ship, who had gradually made up a lot of ground in
the last mile, to try conclusions witli the nag that
was trying to give him 381 b. and a beating. But
381 b. is a lot of extra weight in the final stage of
a four-mile steeple, and Booiigal seemed to slow down.
At any rate, Battleship was too fast for him at the
finish. After being blocked in a couple of attempts
to get past the big fellow, the sturdy little Flagship
horse dodged round him on the outside and won by a
length and a half. Torone came third, five lengths
behind the gallant Booiigal. None of the
most fancied animals, bar Guneap, committed
a serious blunder, . though it was evidently
the unwonted strain of fence-jumping that
found hurdle-racer Uxbridge out long before the
finish. Guneap, the hero of 12 months ago, hit a fence
sufficiently hard to tilt his jockey (A. J. Bird) off his
hack. Last year it was Battleship, looking all over
a winner at the time, who tilted the same rider off
/m- back. There’s a lot of luck in steeplechasing. But
there’s a lot more luck (and roguery) in fiat racing,
especially when a large field comes jostling round the
turn for home in a six-furlongs sprint.
* * * *
Battleship must be the only horse in the
world that has won £1250 of stake money within a
month of his being disqualified for a whole year.
On July 14 the stipendiary stewards decided to wipe
out Battleship and two of his human connections on
account of his unsatisfactory running in a steeple at
Sandown Park. Owner, jockey and trainer appealed
to the V.R.O. committee against the stipes’ unkind
decision, and the committee, in itp turn, wiped out
the disqualification. On August 14 Battleship brought
off the long-expected coup, and the stipes probablv
felt that they had had at least a little justifiable
suspicion to go upon.
The danger of being too’ free and easy
with a starter was pointed out to a Caulfield trainer
at that course on Saturday. The trainer’s son, who
had the mount on Amata in the Moondah Plate, was
left at the post, whereupon dad had a heart-to-heart
talk with the person whom he believed to be respon-
sible. lie went so far as to call him—-but there,
whv go into the harrowing details ? Suffice to say
that the committee being complained to fined dad
£5O and intimated that further undictionary remarks
would probably mean the cancellation of his trainer’s
license.

“Saddle and Silk”: The La w prohibits
betting in N. S. Wales except on racecourses. All the
same,-last week Sir Alwynton was backed for Melbourne
Cup in a Sydney sporting club to win £20,000.
Three McShortodds are at one end of the gamble.
As the Cup is still three months off there is plenty
of time for either side to lay-off or leave for
foreign lands.
Sydney Metropolitan “registered” racing
business (including Hawkesbury) for 1914-15 estab-
lished records in both prize-money and races. Alto-
gether 394 events were run on six courses, the
winners being divided between 111 trainers. W.
Kelso headed the list with 14 wins, and Mark Thomp-
son and P. Nolan, with 13 each, tied for second
place. In the flat races 68 jockeys shared the wins ;
W. Lillyman went one better than McLachlan’s effort
in the prevmus season, and was in the lead with 25 ;
P- Maher scored 184; and Bracken, Wood and
McLachlan 18 each. In the 47 jumping events S.
Howie rode nine winners and E. Moon was next
most successful with five. Taunter (seveii wins)
was the most advanced horse; and Mountain ; Knight
(three-year-olds and over) with £GIGS, and Cetigne
(two-year-olds) with £5356 earned the fullest oat-
bags.
Poaching (Lurcher- —Millfield) is the
speediest racehorse in Bananaland these days. In
the past fortnight he had a win at Albion Park, and
then got away with the National Plate (w.t'.a),
Exhibition Handicap and Denman Plate (w.f.a.) at
the Q.T.C. meeting. The animal, which is Queens-
land owned and bred, is not nominated in any of the
big handicaps to be run shortly in the southern
States.

Two racing notorieties passed the Judge’s
post last week—William Noud, owner, trainer and
breeder, aged 78; and Archie Thomson, a leading
light in the Sydney “unregistered” camp.
During its Spring Meeting the A..T.C.
(Sydney) will distribute £29,550, which is £2BOO
less than last year’s amount.
In a warning to those people who are
clamoring for the shutting' up of the racecourses
John Barker, chairman of the South Aus. J. C., at
the annual meeting last week, stated that since the
outbreak of war 70,000 horses had been purchased
by the Commonwealth. “This,” he said, “goes to
show what a direct interest the thoroughbred inci-
dentally plays in a big war.” It ought to; but
does it? A vet. at the liemount Depot, Cairo, wrote
to The Bulletin : “I examine daily some
400 horses, and, as" an oversea shipper, would say
that only 25 per cent, of that number are ever flit
to leave Australia.” And, anyhow, isn’t it non-
sense to say that “if racing were abandoned it would
mean the death-knell of the thoroughbred” ? The
racing thoroughbred isn’t the only thoroughbred in
the world; which is to say, that racing isn’t the
only purpose for which man breeds the highest-class
stock We needn’t talk cant about horse-racing in
order to defend it, though there is always a disposi-
tion to do it. A-

A bullet was stopped at Riccarton (M.L.)
a week or two ago by the American-bred trotter
Imperious, sired by Director in California and
brought to Maoriland by Mangan and Wilson. He
was not a great success at the stud,, and his claim
to this obituary notice rests main ly on the fact
that he was two days off thirty-seven years old when
the merciful bullet made a target of him.

Snaffle : The writer of a sporting notion
(B. 12 / 8/’l 5) clubs himself “An Unemployed
Bishop.” An employed one is a Bishop who h
years has been “Goodwood” of the Argus and
“Ribbleden” of the Australasian. I can recall
these sporting writers in Melbourne: “Voltigeur,” in
Bells Life, W. Levey; “Orange Blossom” and
“Augur,” Chapman; “Peeping Tom,” Yuille, sen.;
“Playboy,” Yuille, jun. ; “Tout Cela,” Dicker Ham-
ilton (a rum card); “Nemo.” Pickering; “Bag-
picker,” Simons; “Eclipse,” Smith; “Apemantus,”
Morns; “Huon” (the first, I think), Dinley; “Ter-
linga,” Cook. At the tip of my tongue, but I
cannot get his name out, is “Warwick,” who gave
four V.R.C. winners in one day.

A Vic. racing gee bears the significant
mock-Irish name of Bally.seed}*. Its godfather, pre-
sumably, had been out with the bhoys the night
before the christening.
At the Brisbane Horse Show last week all
high-jumping records in Bananaland were overtopped
by Bandolier and Landlock. Both cleared 6ft. llin.,
an inch above Radium’s record in an exhibition leap
in 191 U ; but both failed in an attempt to wipe out
the Australian record, 7ft. 3fin., made by Bandolier
at Qunindi (N.S.W.). Landlock (owned by Eroni
Bros.) was ridden by George Eroni, and Bandolier
(owned by A. Judd) was aeroplaned by George Kay.
Football in Sydney nears the end of its
season s tether. Saturday’s play developed little that
was unexpected except in the match between Glebe
and Pyirnont (British Association), which ended in
a f and a heart .v exchange of stoush. One of
the Glebe men left the battlefield feet first en route
to the hospital. The outcome of the game was that
the Rawson Cup went to Granville, and is now the
club s pioperty, having been brought home two
seasons in succession. In the Rugby League compe-
tition Balmain still heads the procession, and the
premiership is practically all over bar celebrating
the occasion. Paddington has a mortgage on the
Australian Rules League competition with a 12
points’ lead, and Sydney and Balmain Caledonians
have qualified for the Dewar Cup championship
under the Metropolitan Soccer Assoc. Balmain
Caledonians have established a record this year by
having practically won the competitions in the First
and Reserve Leagues, qualified for the Dewar Cup
and reached the semi-final stage of the Charity Cup.
When handing over a motor ambulance to
the A.M.C. on behalf of N.S.W. Rugby League some
days ago, Joynton Smith stated that 1000 players
had either gone to the Front or were in camp, train-
ing. In cash about £l5OO will have passed from
the League to various Patriotic funds by the end of
the season. The N.S.W. Rugby Union is also most
honorably represented where the men stand defending
the nation. As for monetary assistance, Union
players have done their share and are taking a
specially active part in furthering the amateur
sportsmen’s effort to rake in a thousand pounds
before September 4. On that date an outburst of
Cafe Chantant, bazaar and fancy-dress ball will take
place at the Town Hall. Proceeds go to the
Wounded Soldiers’ Fund, so nothing more need be
said. v

If it weren't for the inconveniences of
war this year’s closing games of Vic. League toeball
would have aroused much enthusiasm. On Saturday
week Collingwood, which had beaten all the teams
save Carlton, went down a second time to that com-
bination, by one lonely point. This still left it at
the head of the procession, with a double chance for
premiership, but by only two points —half-a-game.
On Saturday it encountered Fitzroy, and looked like
being defeated until the middle of the last quarter,
when ’Roy was still a dozen points ahead. But,
from then to the close, the Magpies became offensive
and pressed the Maroons so hard that at the finish
they had accumulated 63 points to ’Roy’s 62. Down
at Geelong South Melbourne over-ran the local men,
scoring 74 points to 52, and at East Melbourne
Essendon passed down Melbourne by 75 to 56, the
significance of which feat lies in the fact that South
thereby drew up to within four points of Melbourne.
Next Saturday Melbourne has a bye, while South
meets ’Wood, and, if it can win, will bump Mel-
bourne out of the “four.” Carlton annihilated
Richmond by 117 to 49.
On St. Kilda ground a large “house” paid
a good sum into the Wounded Soldiers’ Fund to
watch the Assoc, premiers, North Melbourne, demolish
a strong team of Saints (League). The latter aren’t
top-notchers, but neither are they tail-enders, and
the fact that North downed them by 57 points to 31
shows that Ass. players are no slouches at the game.
It is the first time since the League formed itself
in ’96 that the controlling bodies have allowed any
of their teams to plav in the other's backyard.

ern Cup, 30 dogs, value £4O and trophy. In 15

Waterloo Cup, but was then withdrawn. His owner

“Nym”: Fears are expressed that, from
some unexplained causes, the blackfish, the shyest
and sweetest of our native freshwater tribes, are in
clanger of becoming a memory. North
of the Dividing Range in Victoria the
blackfish is the Cinderella of the rivers.
Where cod, bream, perch and other
cannibals abound his average weight
is only a few ounces, so anglers in
those waters won’t miss him ..much
except as bait. On the other hand, in
the sluggish, murky waters of the
Gippsland streams blackfish are re-
ported to be caught up to 41b. weight.
The fish is like an eel in color and
flesh-texture. It is a good sport for its size, and
will give the angler fun when other fish are taking
their afternoon nap.

Last week’s Queensland-N.S.W. tennis
match was as mild as a second-grade bowling- tour-
ney in a no-license district. The Ma State came out
on top with a pretty solid 'margin, gained mostly in
the singles. In the doubles the difference wasn’t
worth getting excited about. The evergreen Horace
Rice took the only D.C.M. offering. He beat both
Ratten and St. John, Queensland’s first line of
defence, with the loss of only one set; and with
0. Todd he went through the doubles with a clean
slate. On the other hand, Goodman and Bonning-
ton (N.S.W.) couldn’t do better than win one set
out of seven in (lie doubles.

Maoriland tennis-players have decided on
a memorial to Anthony Wilding-, and the Austral-
asian Association is also to establish one or perhaps
two. The council is asking the public for £250.
which will be invested, and the interest—£lo or
£l5 a year—is to be spent on a trophy for the winner
of the. Australasian Singles Championship. Anything
subscribed over £250 will go to some memorial not
yet decided upon.

Bert Spargo (Sst. who recently
lost the decision on points against rugged Charlie
Simpson, put it all over Geo. Taylor (Bst. 121 b.) at
Melbourne Stadium on Saturday. Taylor is a
strong, confident boxer with a peculiar habit of
scythe-swinging rights and lefts. This method has
demoralised most of the boxers who have met Tay-
lor; but Spargo, after studying. it for three rounds,
clipped a quick right to the reaper’s jaw and put
him out of business for Ssec. That was the preface
to the finale. Spargo simply paralysed Taylor with
a hail of scientific blows, especially in the infighting.
The gong saved him in the 12th, and in the 13th
referee Quirk placed his hand on Spargo and said
the Benediction. The winner, who has been in the
game only about nine months, looks likely to cause
considerable flutter amongst the feather-weight doves.

Charles Cate, a well-known Maoriland
boxer, took the Pinal Count at Gisborne (M.L.),
being outed by a tree while bush-felling. His mates
had a particularly rough time carrying the body
to civilisation over bush tracks and flooded streams.
He was one of the most Valuable members the Gis-
borne (M.L.) Boxing Association fever bad. He boxed
for the sheer love of the game, would fight
anybody, and was the type of stoush trader that the
raw bushmen love to see. He never won a cham-
pionship, but he was runner-up twice and, besides,
had won races on the running and cycling tracks.
Bob Fitzsimmons has been inviting trouble
again in the matrimonial ring. Having been divorced
by the little actress who made him into a .showman
and toured these parts with him a few years back,
he turned up at the City Hall, Newark (U.S.A.), re-
cently for a marriage license. Bob gave his age as
53 and that of the girl (a divorced wife) as 28 ;
but as he had neglected to procure a certificate of
his own divorce he was told to call again.
“Masetto”: Petered out at Melbourne
Hospital this week Sam Floyd, an all-round sport
of 30 years back. He cut a figure as jockey, run-
ner, pugilist and gun-shot. His best-known mounts
were Cruiser, Simpleton, Intrepid and Helmet. In
1886 he fought Ike Bitton, at Caulfield, with book-
maker Joe Thompson as referee. Bitton got
the verdict. Prior to his death Floyd had lived alone
for some time, and was found in his house suffering
from cerebral haemorrhage. That settled him.
“J.F.H.” (London) : Victor Trumper got
good obituary notices in the London papers, in spite
of the tremendous pressure of what passes for war
news. J. B. Hobbs, the Surrey batsman and cricket
writer for the Evening News, stresses the Austra-
lian's complete absence of “side,” and wishes that
more cricketers were like him in that respect. Hobbs
remembers with gratitude how kind Trumper was to
him as a newchum on his first visit to Australia.
E. H. D. Sewell, in the Evening Standard, calls
him “one of the most charming cricketers it has
been my lot to meet.” Sewell thinks he “might
easily have been famous as a bowler” as well as a
batsman, and he considers Clem Hill and Victor
the two best outfields he has seen. The Daily
Chronicle calls him “the best and most brilliant
of all Australia’s great cricketers.” The Daily
Telegraph remembered the “champagne” simile —
“The name of Trumper will endure for all time,
lie was the champagne of cricket, the embodiment
of grace and ease.” On the other hand the Pall
Mall Gazette considers W. L. Murdoch the great-
est of Australia’s, batsmen —the “W. G. Grace of the
Antipodes”—while acknowledging Trumper’s pre-
eminence in charm and style.

“Grand Stand”: The decision of the
Cricket Associations to cut out the inter-State pro-
gramme next season will have an adverse effect on
the membership of the Sydney Cricket Ground. The
attractions for members have petered out in every
direction, the only important uses to which the
ground is now put being patriotic demonstrations,
and these the member can’t attend “on the nod ’
with self-respect. The dodge relied on by the trustees
to keep their members together is a stiff entrance
fee, but members who quit 'paying subs, will save
that to rejoin in more salubrious times. A reduced
rate of subscription would probably save the trustees
any considerable loss of members, but such a move
would need to be announced promptly to be effective.
This gives an idea of what cricket in the;
Ma State is going to be like next seasoii. The'
Junior Cricket Association, prior to the war, had
5600 members; since the war the number has been
reduced to 4390. Most of the missing 1210 have,
taken the war trail.

Billiardist Frank Smith, jun., put up
remarkable bursts in the closing stages, of the
N.S.W. Markers’ Tournament' at Sydney. In the
semi-final, playing from the “owes 300” mark, he
defeated Griffith (“200 on”) by 348 ; and, in the
final, Cressy (“290 on”) was blown out with 100
points in arrears. Both games were only 500 up.
Smith, who, bj r the way, is the holder of the N.S.\V.
snooker championship, is handling the cue -so ably
that a match v. Walter Lindrmn is in the making.
On this the chances of a higher step in the billiard
ladder depends.

J. Fleming, of Stratford, and J. P. Hughes, of
Auckland, shot equal. There were 42 competitors,
which is a record for a championship meeting in

Maoriland continues to s topic its rivers
.with trout. Various orders for about .2,000,000
trout eggs are being fulfilled at one„of the Govern-
ment hatcheries for the South Island ami 500,000
for the North Island. Mighty trout-fishers • are the
Maorilander and the stranger within his gates. He
keeps his hand in on the English brown trout, which
were imported and acclimatised in the late ’6o’s,
the Loch Leven and Scottish brown trout, the rain-
bow trout, as well as perch, carp and tench. Enthu-
siasts journey across half the world to fish in M.L.
streams and! lakes. Some, indeed, make yearly
pilgrimages fj>r the purpose.
“G.V.W.” : Regarding the use of the rifle
in fishing (“Outcast,” B. 22/ 7 / ’ 15), the modern
service gun, fired a few inches above the surface
of the water, is the best fish extractor I have seen.
If a pool is a large one you must be ready to get
the fruits of victory off the surface of the water
as quickly as possible, as they soon recover con-
sciousness. Unlike dynamite, lime and other Hun-
nish methods of fishing, the rifle does not kill. Thus
any fish not large enough can be let go till your
next annual holidays. Some years ago, down in the
south end of Maoriland, I went out with a rifle-
fishing party that on the first day got 15 fish, weigh-
ing 631 b. The second day we gathered in 22, weigh-
ing 811 b. It was magnificent, but I dunno whether
it was sport.

“0.K.”: Novelist Le Queux’s circumstan-
j*i ... n
account of his doings with a report of
tue Kaiser s “secret speecn in 1908
amounts to a tremendous accusation against
some persons in the British Cabinet circle
of that time. Le Queux’s yarn is that he
took a report of the Kaiser’s speech to
England., Three days after reading it Lord
Roberts resigned from the Army Council to
devote the rest of his life to preaching his
universal service scheme. Le Queux wrote
the first two chapters of a book intended to
Warn the public. He took them to publisher
Nash, and from Nash’s desk, he says, they were
stolen. Two days later the police in Berlin
raided the houses of three military friends
of Le Queux in search of correspondence
from him. Then he was called to the Brit-
ish War Office, where Colonel Macdona,-
Director of the Secret Service, said: “I
have been instructed by a very high per-
sonage to request you to say nothing about
that secret speech of the Kaiser’s and not
to publish that book concerning it.” He
does not know who the “high personage”
"£?• T By b ord liohnDss advice lie wrote
Lhe Invasion ot England, and Campbell
Bannerman, then Prime Minister, denounced
him as a scaremonger. The question that
now suggests itself is : “Why was Colonel
Macdona, the man who knew all the secrets
of the Secret Service, taken from his nost
and packed oft to lhe Front as soon as war
began?”' In those days, and for many days
thereafter, every true anti-German prophet
of evil was denounced as a scaremonger,
Poor old anxious Roberts was called a
dotard and nothing could he revealed with-
out offending high personages. To-day
the same pro-German forces, or the remnant
of them, are employed in throwing out the
insinuations that Le Queux is a wilful liar
or wild imaginator.

If I were both Houses of Parliament and every-
thing- else up to the High Court, I would for a start
establish these reforms: —
1. A Commercial Court. Even tardy old England
lias given us a lead in this respect. Let its pio
cednre be “rolls'll and ready, and its tunction to
sett]e disputes which ar i se in the course of everyday
busincgs . It must be as brisk as the times. Nearly
everything which is now referred to arbitration for
the sake of inexpensiveness and speed could be-dealt
with at little extra expense, at the same speed, and
with less injustice.
2. A uniform divorce law for the Commonwealth,
sweeping aside technical questions of domicile between
subjects of the different States simplifying pro-
cednre, and cutting out many of the present expenses
of untying marriage knots. .
. 3 - A similar measure of Companies law to secure
inter-State uniformity.
. 4 - The inauguration of a Society for the I reran-
tlon ot Cruelt - V to Ignorantly Bliss ul ieu s.
A complete remodelling of the present law relat-
to hire-purchase and time-payment agreements.

GRIPPED BY
CATARRH!
YOU are in the grip of Catarrh. Isn’t
it a most discomforting and humiliating
affliction? The indications are unmis-
takeable—
—the uncomfortable stuffiness in
the nose.
the constant sniff, sniff, caused by
moist accumulations;
—the difficulty of breathing through
the nostrils,
—the persistent necessity of clearing
the throat by hawking, and
—the frequent soreness of the throat,
—or you may suffer from frontal
headaches,
—your hearing may be affected,
—you may have nerve-racking noises
in the head,
—you may be subject to frequent
colds, or
—awake always with a heavy, tired
feeling.
This terrible Catarrh makes you down-
hearted, and is ruining your life, wreck-
ing your hopes and threatening you
with even greater pain and miseiy.
WHAT ARE YOU GOIMG TO DO
ABOUT IT ?
You can’t go on suffering; you cannot
neglect your condition, because that
would he fatal. Perhaps you have tried
many tilings without securing any last-
ing relief; perhaps you’re so down-
hearted and discouraged that you feel
there is no hopp. But THEBE IS A
WORLD OF HOPE FOR YOU in my
great “KAT-AR-AH,” and the proof
is FREE.
TrialTrealmentFrae
Try “KAT-AR-AH” at my expense.
You’ll marvel at the results. Let me
send you a trial bottle at once.
Its healing effects are simp’y remark-
able. You can notice an immediate
improvement. It quickly starts its
work of killing the disease germs, of
reducing and eventually stopping the
discomforting mucous discharges in
the nose and throat—mucous that is
finding its way into your str mach and
poisoning your system. It does this in
the only sane and safe way—by its
health-giving and purifying eero-sara-
tive effect on the diseased parts and by
cleansing all the passages of accumul-
ated mucous.
With the trial bottle of “KAT-AR-AH ”

The Killing of Superfluous Hair.
It is easy to remove superfluous hair tem-
porarily, but to remove it permanently is
quite another matter. Not many women know
that for this purpose such a simple substance
as powdered pheminol may he used, applied
directly to the hair. The recommended treat-
ment is designed not merely to instantly re-
move the hair, but also to eventually kill the
roots entirely. Almost any chemist could
supply an ounce of pheminol, which quantity
should be sufficient.
Renewing Complexions by Absorption.
If your complexion is marred with sallow-
ness, moth patches, pimples or freckles, it is
useless to potter with powders and paints,
lotions, creams and things, in an effort to get
rid of the trouble. Unless you have some
ability as an artist you will mar your appear-
ance still more. The new and rational way
is to take off the complexion itself, with all
its offensive marks. Just get some pure
p ovcolised wax at the chemist’s and use at
night the same as cold cream. Remove next
morning with water and soap, following with
dash of cold water. The mercolised wax
absorbs the half-dead scarf skin in flaky par-
ticles, so gradually no one guesses vou are
treating your face—unless it be by the result,
which is truly wonderful. There is nothing
like it for bestowing a natural, healthy and
beautiful complexion.
Hair Culture.
There is no excuse for falling hair; no ex-
cuse for thin, sick hair, or bald spots. No
beauty of features can make up for a distress-
ing lack of hair growth, and the following
formula will positively force the hair to grow.
Mix about an oubce of boranium in Upint, of
bay rum, shake the bottle well and allow it
to stand for half an hour, then add J-pint of
fresh cold water and strain. Rub w*ell into
the scalp, and in two weeks’ time look for the
new growth; you will not require a micro-
scope to see it.
A “Blackhead” Secret.
Blackheads, oily skins and enlarged pores
usually go together, but can be instantly cor-
rected by a unique new process. A tablet of
stymol, obtained from the chemist's, is dropped
in a tumbler of hot water, which will then, of
course, “fizz” briskly. When the effervescence
has subsided the face is bathed with the
stymol-charged water and then dried with a
towel. The offending blackheads, of their
own accord, come right off on the towel, the
large, oily pores Immediately contract, and
efface themselves naturally. There is no
squeezing, forcing or any drastic action. The
skin is left uninjured, smooth, soft and cool.
A few such treatments should be taken at in
tervals of three or four days thereafter in
order to insure the permanence of the pleas-
ing result so quickly obtained.
Don’t Have Grey Hair.
Grey hair is often a serious handicap to
both men and women while still in the prime
of life. Hair dyes are not advisable because
they are always obvious, inconvenient and
often downright injurious. Few people know
that a very simple formula, which is easily
made up at home, will turn the hair back to
a natural color in a perfectly harmless man-
ner. You have only to get an ounce of tamma-
lite concentrate from your chemist and mix it
with four ounces of bay rum to prove this.
Apply this simple and harmless lotion for a
few nights to the hair with a small spoil so-
and the greyness will gradually disappear.
The lotion is neither sticky nor greasv, and
has been proved over and over again for
generations past by those in possession of the
formula.
About Shampoos.
To quote an eminent London beauty special-
ist: “The slimy egg cannot dissolve the scalp
impurities, but only adds to the trouble by
completely choking the pores with animal
matter.” The substance sticks, decomposes,
thereby causing the hair to assume a dead.
dull color.” Avoid eggs (and soap, too) on
your hair. Try the delightful preparation
made by stirring a teaspoonful of stallax in
a cup of hot water. It will bring out new
beauty possibilities in your hair, will clear
and prevent dandruff, and leave that fine
fluffy effect so much sought after. It also
removes excess oil or greasiness [4

“Jwosp”; The first V.C. secured by a
mummer in this war blooms on the bosom of
a motion-picture player, Wallace M’Cutcheon.
He was with the Kalem Picture Co. when
things began to move in Europe. Chucking
his job, as a result of previous experience
in New York’s National Guard he got a
commission, and is now Captain Wallace
M‘Cutcheon, V.C.
“M.P.A.”: The Annette Ivellerman pose
which now 7 adorns the hoardings in Mel-
bourne w r as the identical one to which the
Dublin wowsers objected a few years ago. I
had noticed the poster on the walls for days,
and then one fine morning the symmetrical
form of Annette was defaced with blank
paper. I told Charles Terry, the manager of
the Royal, and he, making instant inquiries,
discovered that a committee of public morals,
or something, had been at w 7 ork.
“Stargazer”: I would dearly love to read
a Bernard Shaw criticism of “The Choco-
late Soldier” in the vein of his old Satur-
day Review 7 theatrical articles. “The Choco-
late Soldier” professes to be Shaw’s ow 7 n
“Arms and the Man” converted to comic-
opera. purposes, and Shaw has not repudi-
ated it. The thing has certain good quali-
ties,_ but its wit is often banal, and' the
Nactina and Bumerli dance is graceless and
paltry. How does Bernard Shaw like the
sparkling dialogue betw r een hero and heroine,
“ ‘l’ve come to sit on that nice chair.’ ‘l’d
like to sit on you,’ ” and the almost childish
piffle, of Nadina’s letter to her Chocolate
Soldier? The inspired programme says that
the only changes made are such as are neces-
sary for the lyric stage, which seems to mean
that nothing is suitable for the lyric stage
it it isn’t at least 33 per cent, drivel.
“J.F.H.” (from London) : Harry Lauder
has given the best answer to the demand that
we should close all theatres and places of
amusement until the w 7 ar is finished off and
Kaiser Bill has gone to a place where skating
is scarce. In his homely Scottish he says
shutting up amusement shops w 7 ould be
“sweetening the enemy’s tea.”
Ethel Irving w r as playing recently in an
impressive one-act drama at London Coli-
seum ; but she will shortly appear again at
a “regular” theatre in a play which was
titled “The Kick In” wdien produced in the
U.S.A., and will be called “Shell Out” when
Miss Irving stages it.
After a summer holiday Oscar Asche
returns to the regular London theatres in a
new spectacular play, “The Spanish Main.”
Oscar describes it as suggestive of a Robert
Louis Stevenson story, “starting in the
picturesque setting of a Spanish w 7 ine shop,
passing to the deck of a 17th century buc-
caneer in mid-ocean, and reaching its climax
on a lonely treasure island.” Lily Brayton
is to be a Spanish lady, and she will live up
to that a good deal more easily than her
husband will turn himself into a daredevil
broth of a bhoy.
( Tt is a pity, after the successful run of
‘On Our Selection,” to see an Australian
play begging for a buyer. Yet there is one up
iu Queensland waiting for an enterprising
manager to say the word. The Bulletin
hasn’t read the play, but has received this
note from the author: “Sir i have written a
australian play will you undertake it as a
publishing item or place it on the market.”
Any offers? J.C.W., Ltd., noted for its
burning desire to encourage Australian pro-
ductions and its hatred of imported stuff,
may have first say.
“Norbell”: Our bellow co., showing in
Kalgoorlie, was short-handed, and we bor-
rowed a well-known vaudevillain to
strengthen the cast. We made him the
venerable Corsican landlord of the II Pes-
catori inn near Ajaccio. Looking like a
red-nosed, wire-whiskered escapee from the
Old Men’s Home, he “came on” the first
night. “Cristina!” he called, “Cristina!
where are you?” Cristina missed the cue
and didn’t materialise. “Ah!” he con-
tinued, “these Dago tarts are the dizzy
limit! Blime, Cristina, where are yer?”
Then he gagged: “I suppose she’s sewin’
on buttons for the yardman!” Another
pause. .Then: “Never mind, if you give me
your kind attention for a few moments,
ladies and gentlemen, I’ll sing ybu a little
ditty entitled. ‘When the Missus is Out.’ ”
And he did !
ARS LONGA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I met him in a country town;
I recognised his moody brow;
I’d known him when his hair was brown—
Twas dyed a greenish purple now;
And though his clothes were worn and frayed,
He’d still the swagger of his trade.
Ho wore a badly damaged hat,
And bulbous bool's, beyond repair;
Yet, overmastering all that,
A gracious, condescending air.
His battered front and pompous mien
Proclaimed the Ac-tor who has been.
A mummer of an earlier day,
He graced the boards of long ago;
But latterly he’d yelled “Hooray!”
With “omnes” in a city show,
And played small parts at “super” rates,
And said: “Me lord! The carriage waits!”
He greeted me with beaming face.
“Well met in Cyprus, friend!” lie cried;
Then waved his hand with courtly grace
Towards the bar. We went inside
And quaffed a cup (for which I paid),
And talked of all the hits he’d made.
He babbled of the golden days
When he was Hamlet and Macbeth ;
He talked of tragedies and. plays,
Nor ever stopped to draw a breath.
Then while he mopped his Thespian brow,
I asked what he was doing now.
“I’m here with Shock and Buskem's Co.,
We’ve been on tour for several weeks;
‘East Lynne,’ a very decent show” —-
The old man puffed his hollow cheeks,
And in his most impressive style
Explained: “I'm playing juvenile!”

“My sister was always thin
and weak, and at times was

lacking in energy. Her
appetite, too, was very poor,
and she often complained
of headache. Since giving
her ‘ Scott’s Emulsion,’
she has made splendid
progress. Her appetite has
wonderfully improved, she
has gained greatly in weight,
and lias lost the tired feel-

Emulsion all the credit, as
no other medicine was

They are such marvellous value that the Silver

HOW IS IT DONE?
Well, our managing director, when in Sheffield,
was ordering Solid Silver Goods very largely, and
asked for quotations for an enormous number of
Sauce Boats —to be made at slack times. To be
extra heavy-weights, that would wear for hundreds
of years. To be of approved designs and plain, so
as to be easily cleaned. To be paid for spot cash
against delivery in London.
Result: Solid Silver Sauce Boats of unparalleled
value. Indeed, solid silver at less than the usual
prices of electroplate.
This is one only of a number of similar value solid
silver lines.

From the President of our Peace Society:
I have prorogued our circle, and have had the club
gas cut off at the meter, owing to the hopeless out-
look. The growth of bloodthirstiness in our suburb
has appalled me. All my neighbors—most of them
far too old to need excuses for not being at the
Front—have joined the local rifle club. On two
nights a week, and sometimes on Saturdays as well,
they put on clay-colored fighting-clothes and tie on
wide-brimmed felt hats. As most of them wear spec- 1
tacles and the clothes have no shape at all they look
very terrifying, especially when they stand in rows
and dodge behind one another in a manner I can
only call sinister. In my opinion they are a danger
to short-sighted old ladies with weak hearts, ner-
vous children, invalids and restive horses. My heart
bleeds for the poor wives of these amateur slaughter-
men, who, when safe at home, represent themselves
as tigevishly eager to go to the Front and shed
blood. I suspect that some of them are mere lying
braggarts, and, if there is no abatement of the
nuisance, I shall put the matter to the test by
- Hitting one of them with my most-German umbrella
and saying. “Yah!” in a guttural tone. The worst
that is likely to happen to me is a punch on the
nose, and I don’t mind bleeding a little for the
sacred cause of peace. I am willing to shed anything
up to half a pint. You will realise that I am in
earnest when I tdll you I have three spare hand-
kerchiefs ready in my pocket.
Some good stuff is being written on the
war by Fred Cutlaek, of Renmark, wlio was
secretary to editor Sowden on the Adelaide
Register before be went to London at 21
to tread the Inky Way. Now he is a Royal
Artillery lieutenant, and writes vivid things
like this to his father
Then the Ist Life Guards came riding up in half
sections; a muddy lot of scarecrows, and I could
not help grinning to think of how I last saw them
in front of Buckingham Palace... .A good nerve-
testing walk up the edge of a mustard field, where
the German snipers can see you. A bullet is a
decent, clean, Christian tiling to get hit with, so
one reconciles oneself to that walk by thinking of
the jam-tin bombs full of rusty rivets which make
hell in the trenches, and of the high-explosive shells
which hurl jagged iron at one all round the battery
.... When a really good bombardment was on, the
shells would howl round us in the dugouts like wild
beasts. The garden looked like the scene of a vol-
canic eruption. Enormous and terrifying black
shells were dropping out of heaven like railway
accidents, and blowing half a street to pie'ces where
they fell.
That young man ought to be writing for a
wider public.
FOILED TREACHERY
Armed with a knife a
Mexican did softly creep
Towards a tent where an officer
Lay hushed in sleep ;
There was the click of a lock
And the treacherous one
Looked up at the muzzle
Of a sentinel’s gun.
As the moon shone down
From the starry sphere
Upon his knees fell the wretch
In a tremor of fear.
To his master the watch
His loyal duty fulfilled;
The life of the Mexican
For ever was stilled.

Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort, and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
iare too severe on the enamel.

In the Waratah district of Tasmania one
jn every 10 of the population has enlisted.
It’s a mining district, where the proportion
of men is high ; but even so, the record will
take a lot of beating. The average for the
wfiole Commonwealth is now about one in

A star-gazing billet is vacant, Baracchi,
the Victoria State Astronomer, having re-

and has been drawing £7OO each 12 months
since. Assistant Baldwin is keeping an eye

Before Federation Baracchi was also meteor-
ologist. He is an Italian, and pleads guilty
to 65.
A Sydney firm of Gentlemen One has
gone one better. While handing a departing
clerk the customary wrist-watcli last week,
the senior partner mentioned that not only
was the firm keeping the billets of its mili-
tary employees open and paying them their
salaries, but each V.C.-winner would receive
£lOO. The odds against a V.C. being about
300,000 to one, the risks won’t keep the firm
awake o’ nights. Still there can be no
criticism of the intention.
Adelaide’s big paint, paper and glass co.,
which has continued to bear the name of its
founder Vosz, though he died long since, has
decided not to keep answering rude questions.
Last week its shareholders therefore passed
a resolution that, “as all the shares are held
by South Australian residents of British
name and British or Australian birth,” it will
assume the name of its present managing
director, and henceforth be known as
“Clarkson, Limited.”
The Mitchell Library (Sydney) has
bought what is believed to be the first
Masonic certificate issued in Australia. It
was given to Anthony Fenn Kemp, of the
N. S. Wales Corps, on September 17, 1802,
is in French, and was issued, it is presumed,
by a lodge held on board one of the French
visiting ships. In May, 1803, Henry Browne
Hayes applied to Governor King for per-
mission to open a Masonic Lodge. The per-
mission was not forthcoming; but he opened
one all the same, and was sent to hard labor
for his pains. The first regular lodge was
held by officers of the 46th Regiment in
1814, and the second by the 48th Regirse.nt,
“a number of respectable inhabitants” being
also initiated.
According to mail-particulars now avail-
able Cyril Brudenell White, the youthful
Lieutenant-Colonel whose D.S.O. was an-
nounced in the first Australian list of war-
honors, was alongside Bridges when the
General fell. White was a lieutenant in
S’Africa when very young, and afterwards
acted for some time as aide-de-camp to the
late General Flutton, a fact which helped
to shape his career/ He was the first ex-
change-officer to be sent to England from
Australia under the new Defence scheme.
His forebears came to Victoria from Ireland
in the early days, but White, senior, though
originally a Mallee pioneer, has for years
past been in Queensland.
“Pennant”: When lovely woman wants to
bring her hereditary prey from his hiding-
place she’ll do it or break something. I
was mate of a vessel plugging along the Aus-
tralian coast against a goodish lump of a
sea. We were a bit behind time, and the
“old man” was cursing the weather. Pass-
ing an isolated lighthouse I noticed a two-
flag hoist flying from the staff. Now, a
two-flag signal being always urgent. I
hauled her in a bit until I was able to read
NV—“We are starving.” I stood in for the
land, an alteration of course which brought
the old man on the bridge. When he under-
stood he cursed the lighthouse, his luck and
me. When close in we saw a figure flying
to the tower, and down NV came and in
its place went up, “Assistance not required,”
and then, “Thank you.” The skipper, furious
with rage, put the ship around, promising
all sorts of blue revenge when we got to
port. On arrival we were met by a pathetic
telegram imploring mercy until we knew all.
Later a letter was received by the skipper.
It appeared that the assistant-keeper and
the head-keeper’s daughter had an “under-
standing.” But there was a lovers’ quarrel
while he was on duty, and the girl so exas-
perated the light-man that he cleared out
and hid in the cliff, hoping to get rid of her.
But she wasn’t taking any of that. Know-
ing the signals, she hoisted NV, well satis-
fied that her quarry would come larruping
back to the lighthouse to haul it down quick
and lively. He first knew of the trouble
through seeing from behind his rock our
hooker heading for the shore. His instant
impression was that all aboard were having
a snooze, until our answering pennant was
run up. Then, looking at his flagstaff, he
nearly fell down dead. The “old man” was
a sport and said nothing until, later, the
couple were married. “Serve ’em dam well
right,” was his comment on that festive
occasion.
R. H. Beardsmore, of the N.S.W. Chief
Secretary’s Department, is off to puncture
the sons of Mahomet. He was on Col.
Holmes’s staff in New Guinea and the other
islands where the Hun’s presence was objec-
tionable to the savages. Jfow he has a com-
mission to go to Berlin via Constantinople.
The council of the Agricultural Society of
Vic. is gradually making tracks for the
Front, or as near thereto as its corns will
permit. Arthur Payne, who went the other
day, is being followed by Alan Currie, of
Mount Elephant. Alan, like the rest of the
Curries who swarm at Derrinallum, in the
fatted Camperdown district, is a grass-pro-
prietor. He is best known to the public as
a horse-owner, but belongs to that class of
utilitarian sport, not too plentiful on the
Australian turf, which has studied the
points of the cow as well as those of the
bookmakers’ friend.
One thing that Charles Bean, Australia’s
official war-correspondent, has that nobody
can pick a hole in is courage. A Westralian
warrior wrote home about the long, quiet
pressman: “There are some heroes in this
world, and Bean, the official press corres-
pondent with the Australian forces in the
Dardanelles, and Dr. Matheson are two of
them. Captain Bean carried water up to the
trenches and helped the wounded back all
through the night. He is an honor to Aus-
tralian j'ournalists.” If he ever sees that
soldierly praise there will be a very embar-
rassed pressman in the vicinity of the un-
assuming C. E. W. Bean.
The widow Butler, whose late husband
anchored a lot of Sargood money in a well-
gardened mansion at Brighton (Vic.), is
nowadays doing considerable fete work for
various patriotic funds. It was Henry
Butler, of the stout softgoods firm, who
saved the life of the Kyabram M.L.A.-reduc-
tion movement by putting the first big
cheque in the hat. He and Izzy Moss, the
wool broker, each married a daughter of
recently-deceased theatre-proprietor Wilson,
also known as owner of what was then the
Palace Hotel, Bourke-street. Mrs. Moss is
the best-known 'Liberal woman-speaker in
Victoria, her success being partly due to
the fact that she has saner views about the
policy of the other side than some of the
lesser lights in the same camp. The carv-
ing-up of the Wilson estate has been a great
help to both ladies in their good works.
“Plain Tales” : It is curious in this year
of war to re-read Kipling’s “A Fleet in
Being” and see ho\v invention and organisa-
tion have quickened the senior service since
1898, the year of the little book’s birth. In
one place Rudyard says: “In the afternoon
the battleships overtook us, their white
upper works showing like icebergs as they
topped the sea-line.” The same sight that
enthused the descriptive journalist doubtless
gave the practical-minded John Fisher a pain.
Elsewhere Rud. enthuses over the ancient
Powerful and the Terrible: “One never gets
used to the bulk and height of these berserk
Campanias.” And where are those Cam-
panias now? Wireless, submarines and air-
craft —none of these loom up in the vivid 80
pages. Which shows how far we have trav-
elled in 17 years, and how much Kipling
missed when he hadn’t the young sub-lieu-
tenants of the naval air service to rejoice
over.
The Australian rush to break the bonds
of holy matrimony is as determined as the
Boys of the Third Brigade were to embrace
the Turk. Two hundred cases are piled up
for examination in Sydney alone, and a
hard-pressed Judge is signalling his brothers
for reinforcements. Meanwhile Gents.
One are busy rushing in fresh citations, and
a vast pile of affidavits threatens to impede
the course of justice. The Bulletin , sus-
pects that the Kaiser is at the bottom of
this business, seeds of dissension having been
sewn when a Currency Lass’s grand-daugh-
ter married the second cousin of an accli-
matised Hun’s uncle. Or it may all be due to
drought and the price of chops. Or perhaps
mixed bathing and the Norton Griffiths
atrocity.
A Ted Colles tale from the trenches: —
Yesterday I struck 'Joe (call him Bondi) coming
in, wounded. He told me of the game he and his
cobbers had in the morning catching grenades thrown
from the Turkish; trenches hut 10 yards away, and
hurling them back again. “I heard Dave had met
with an accident?” I ventured. “Yairs,” said
Joe; “he caught one uv th’ bombs, an’ there
wuz jus’ th’ speck uv a spark on th’ fuse. So he
started t’ blow it up a bit afore he threw it back,
an’—well, ’e blew an’ he blew, till ’e blew ’is
’ead off!” Which was the briefest and most vivid
description possible of the tragic manner in which
Dave lost his ’ead.
“C.H.N.”: Strange foods are amongst
the other experiences we Kangas are getting
in the New Guinea territory we bumped
the Squareheads out of. This is what we
had the other day: Bird o’ paradise soup,
fish something like leather-jacket, fricassee
of crocogator (a really good dish), sweet
potatoes, boiled rice, and fruits (mostly
paw paws). I’ll bring some bird o’ paradise
soup with me when I come back and let
vou taste it. You’ll never be happy with
any other soup afterwards.
James Allen, Maoriland’s Minister for
Defence, was born in South Aus., but left
for the rumbling isles as a mere infant. He
got his polished education in England and
graduated M.A. at Cambridge. Mining was
horoscoped for him, and he was a bright
boy at the London School, where he won
the Bessemer and other medals. For many
years he has been first lieutenant of his
party, and when in Opposition led the
attacks on the Government’s financial and
defence proposals. When he assumes his
military title he is Lieut.-Col. Allen, and
garrison artillery is his specialty. Ho is
60, and has sat in Parliament since 18S7.
Reginald J. Black, of N. S. Wales Leg.
Council, has been elected president of the
Pioneers’ Club. Grandfather Black arrived
in Port Jackson after being sent adrift in
1798 by the mutineers of the Lady Shore, of
which vessel he was purser. Some of purser
Black’s letters concerning that sensational
passage are to be read in the Historical
Records. Apparently the eternal feminine
was at the bottom of the trouble—there were
50 female prisoners aboard en route to
Botany Bay.

As papers here have printed it;
At any rate, it does not lack
A sense of color. Very fit
Appears to me this order new
To paint the ducky horses blue.
Blue horse and soldier cap-a-pie—
How fine the broad effect must be!
If really we must have a war
Artistic it should be, and chaste.
The men’s clothes may be chosen for
Utility, but with great taste.
An army in two tints of blue,
With old gold just a touch or two,
Would no judicious maiden scare —
It Should be welcome anywhere!
I’m pleased to see that those who reign
O’er Europe’s martial matters deem

Upon a charming color scheme.

ACID STOMACHS ARE DANGEROUS.
COMMON-SENSE ADVICE BY A
DISTINGUISHED SPECIALIST.
“Acid” stomachs are dangerous because
acid irritates and inflames the delicate lining
of the stomach, thus hindering and prevent-
ing the proper action of the stomach, and
leading to nine-tenths of the cases of stomach
trouble from which people suffer. Medi-
cines and medicinal treatments are useless
in such cases, for they leave the source of
the trouble, the acid in the stomach, as
dangerous as ever. The acid must be neu-
tralised, and its formation prevented, and
the best thing for this purpose is half a
teaspoonful of bisurated magnesia, ft simple
antacid, taken in a little warm or cold water
after eating, which not only neutralises the
acid but -also prevents the fermentation
from which acidity is developed. Poods
which ordinarily cause greatest distress can
be eaten with impunity if the mea! is fol-
lowed with a little bisurated magnesia,
which can be obtained of any chemist, and
should always be kept handy,*
IN BANANA LAND
“W.C.M.”: The Chamber of Commerce is
the home of patriotism. A member of Bris-
bane’s Chamber regularly blithers about
patriotism and “our boys” and the necessity
for sacrifice. Recently an employee had
occasion to sit for a military examination
for promotion. “Of course you know,” said
the patriot, when the man applied for the
necessary day off. “you are doing this at
your own expense.”
“Politicus”: Now that the Federal Par-
liament is making voting a compulsory mat-
ter, it is well to note that not a single
neglectful voter, in Queensland has been fined
for default, and there is no intention
of prosecuting anyone. The thing was a
mere bluff and is now a dead letter'.
A Bundaberg boy writes from the Darda-
nelles : “In our spare time we take off our
guernseys and go hunting for big game.
Everybody has them. We call it ‘chatty
chasing.’ If a man hasn’t tliem it’s a sign
he’s not well.” Which recalls that lately
Prince Adalbert, the Kaiser’s third son, paid
a visit to the Polish trenches, and on his
leaving to go home to Berlin was supplied
with a medical certificate to the effect that
he “carried no infection and was free from
lice.”
EXCLUSIVE.
STAY-AT-HOME NATIVE: “ Glad to see you hack, Bill! An' how did you like England?"
RETURNED TRAVELLER: “Oh, pretty well! But there are two many riewchums there for
my fancy."
Queensland school teachers have shown up
magnificently as volunteers. One hundred
and seventeen have gone to the Front, and
a number -of fine, brainy young fellows among
them have fallen in the thick of the tfouble.
The Public Instruction Department is proud
of its record, and deserves to bet
“Billybunger” from, the Richmond :
An interesting experiment was recently carried
out with great succjeSs at Carrar wool-scour (NQ.).
The artesian bote=water upon which the scour de-
pends has been/petering out for some time, owing to
the casing being eaten away, and latterly it had
almost stopped flowing. The management courage-
ously determined to do what was hitherto deemed
impossible, viz., re-case the bore. The contract was
let, and a start made to draw the old casing. As show-
ing how the water had eaten it away, the largest
piece extracted was less than the size of a man’s
hand. The job was heart-breaking. Several times
the borer wanted to sling the job, but the manager
persevered until at last, within one inch of the origi-
nal depth, the same flow was obtained as when the
bore was first put down. The boring was fairly
accurate, as the difference of one inch (in a few
thousand feet) could easily have been made in screw-
ing up the casing. This opens up great possibilities
for people dependent upon artesian water. An even
better thing has happened on some stations. Within
the past 12 months numbers of bores Which had
diminished from flowing streams and become only
pumping supplies have suddenly developed a good
flow again.
Urquliart, editor of the Charters Towers
Telegraph, who had been telling the local
men that they were not doing their duty to
their country, was asked by sundry foot-
ballers why he didn’t volunteer. Urquhart
immediately got himself examined, and was
passed in. Now he throws back the challenge
to the footballers.
This is like the Bush. A Billjim, flying
into a fury, kicked his dog and broke its leg.
A Prevention of Cruelty to Animals agent
got hold of the. case, prosecuted, and had
Billjim fined. After that, Billjim couldn’t
face his friends, and the other day cleared
out of the district.
Queensland Pastoralists and Grazing
Farmers’ Association protests with fearsome
emphasis that Minister Hunter’s permit given
to certain persons to sell rabbits is inimical
to the interests of the State. A hard-
pressed country is to swarm with rabbits,
but on no account to eat any, lest the man
who catches them for sale should deliber-
ately encourage the little beasts to extend
their families. On the same principle, the
manufacture and importation of wire-netting
ought to be prohibited, because, plainly, in
order to encourage the purchase of the goods,
manufacturers and agents are liable to go on
spreading family rabbits all over;the country.
The curative properties of dugong oil are
no recent, white man’s discovery. Old pioneer
Andrew' Petrie recorded that the North Pine
blacks would carry sick natives to the
mouth of the Brisbane ; ferry them in canoes
across to Fisherman’s Island ; feed them on
dugong; rub the oil into their bodies, and
in a few months bring them back hale.
One inquisitive returning-officer, wanting
to know why a lady did not obey the law
and vote at the last State election, was in-
formed : “As a Christian I believe that the
Scripture says our citizenship is in Heaven,
therefore I cannot take part in the politics
of this world.” It seems an unimpeachable
argument in favor of suicide, whatever it
may be as a defence to a charge of breaking
the electoral law.
The more you hear the more certain it
seems that somebody handed out tire plans
for the invasion of Gallipoli, and the British
and the Australians walked into a hell that
the General and his staff had never dreamed
of. Supporting this theory George Rowe,
senior Brisbane Methodist chaplain, who
came back w r ith this first big lot of wounded,
tells of one surgeon who had worked at the
operating tables in Egypt four days and four
nights, and in all that awful time had been
able to snatch only six hours rest.
Muddlin’ Through.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They found us at the picture show when
Prussia made the war.
Our fleet, thank Gawd, was all alive, a mile
or two from shore ;
But our handful of an army never dreamt
of any ill—
We’d six days’ ammunition to argue things
with Bill!
We’d sworn to save the Belgian from the
Kaiser’s greedy maw —
Before we’d time to place a gun he lay
beneath the paw !
Oh, things was black and blue
For Freedom’s little crew ;
For Freedom’s side, alas! relied on Mess
and Muddle through.
Our boys they murmured “Is it war?” and
whistled “What a lark!”
And ’oped the Kaiser didn’t dream our fleet
was Noah’s Ark;
They knew, of course, that some must go,
but things was hardly ripe
For tearin’ peaceful Britons off from pewter-
pot and pipe.
When Kitchener was made the boss they bel-
lowed out “Hooraw” !
And thought the German soon would feel the
wind behind the paw.
The Frenchy had his guns;
He'd teach the murderin’ Huns !
And us, our ’ope was —give us rope, and we
will muddle through !
But when we’d battled nigh a year and
found the job was stiff, • •
The enemy still plugging and responsive to
the biff,
A dab at diggin’ trenches and at guardin’ of
the same,
Alive to all the dodges and a master of the
game,
And when we’d seen our corpses spread on
Flemish down and plain,
And reckoned up the price of all we’d lost fer
little gain,
We paused and ’gan to wonder if the old
way wasn’t wrong,
And if we hadn’t played the fool in followin’
it so long—
If brains in some degree
Might also needed be,
And if our crew could win anew on Mess
and Muddle through.
You want a pinch of gumption if you’d drive
a city tram,
You need a bit o’ trainin’ if you’d build a
simple dam;
It’s system, system does it when the miner
bores the hill,
And a bit of brains is wanted if you’d only
pound a pill;
But when n nation’s in the grip of black and
bloody throes
Our motto’s “Take it easy, and she’ll weather
all her woes.”
AYe muddled through our troubles with Old
Roney and the Boer,
Our luck held alius steady, and ’twill hold a
trifle more!
Our fathers made it do—
On this the Empire grew.
AA'lio’ll dare to change our motto: “Oh, we
shall muddle through !”
QUEENSLAND.
F. BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, August 14, 1915.
My Dear Thargomindaii,—
Despite war, drought, economy and the
Labor party our country cousins rolled to
Brisbane and the Show in large numbers.
And if they were not satisfied I saw no sign
of their disappointment. Stock-breeders
were brightened up after inspecting pens
of the finest animals that could have been
yarded in Australia. His Ex., who judged
some of the blood stock on Tuesday, will go
bond for me in this. At the official opening
on Wednesday Mrs. and Miss Bananaland
showed a fine taste in glad rags. Lady
Goold-Adams wore grey crepe de chine,
embroidered in silver, and a black hat whose
crown was covered with jet. Mrs. Ryan
also was in grey, a silvery sort of crepe de
chine gown, with ruffles of lace on the sleeves
and at the neck. Her hat was grey, too.
Mrs. Lennon was in mole color, Mrs. Hux-
ham in grey, and Mrs. Hardacro in
amethyst. Coats and skirts of grey
material were well patronised, but for this
rig navy blue was first favorite.
The art section of the Show was a poor
advertisement. Some weird figures alleged
to represent famous British soldiers
deserved the axe of the suffragette. One
of Kitchener and another of “Chinese”
Gordon mounted on an Antarctic zebra or
something appeared to be the unhandiwork
of a German hate-expert. The art work
from the school-children was better.
The Red Gross Society has had a busy
week at the Show and has done good trade.
A feature of its display was a model of the
Australian hut at the big military hospital
at Netley (Eng.). The doll-nurses were
dressed by her Ex. and the bed-clothes were
also the work of her energetic hands. Miss
Scriven made the tiny soldier-invalids pre-
sentable, and the beds, chairs, etc., induce
honorable mention of the Railway work-
shops.
This' afternoon the Society conducted a
demonstration at the Exhibition Grounds
which drew a record crowd. Naval and
military cadets and their bands, lielit horse-
men and infantrymen from the camp and
their bands, and some thousands of school-
cbildreh took part. It was a great parade,
and amongst the admiring host were the
Governor and his other half, the Arthur
Morgans, Premier Ryan and the missus,,
and members of the Ministry with their
women-folk. The takings go into the funds
of the Cross and the Wounded Soldier.
The Society’s funds had another lift on
Thursday night at the Centennial Hall, the
screwjack being a naval concert organised
by Mrs. T. B. Steele. Jack Tars did the
entertaining, and a battalion of pretty girls
did the audience in the bargaining for pro-
grammes. The usual official visitors shed
the light of their countenance on the good
work.
On Thursday night our second batch of
wounded arrived. The arrangements were
much better this time, and possibly they will
ue perfect in a year or two. Still, I doubt
if the politician can be induced to subside.
When the boys reached the station relatives
were barricaded off by a picket of light-
horsemen, while the Premier separated him-
self from a speech. To nervous, weeping
mothers that hold-up seemed the last straw.
Minister Adamson, who did not speak,
earned more gratitude than he’ll ever be
aware of.
To-day was Sweet Pea Day, and was much
the same as Rose Day and Golliwog Day,
save that all collectors had large badges on
their chests and numbered and locked money-
boxes in their hands. This was more satis-
factory both to those who did the hard work
and to the public who did the hard earning.
Recruiting goes on steadily, and a point
was scored when returned soldiers took part.
The professional talker isn’t in the hunt
with the man who saved his breath to climb
the cliffs at Gallipoli.
A patriotic: pageant-play, “To the Day,”
arranged by Mrs. P. J. Symes, will happen
at Her Majesty’s Theatre on August 27.
Tipton station, on the Darling Downs,
lost its hospitable dowager a few days ago,
when Mrs. 11. S. Shanklin threw off the
burden of her 87 years. The deceased was
a sister of the once-famous “Jimmy” Tay-
lor, king of the old Downs squatters—a man
mighty in beeves and cash and acres. The
Downs is thickly sown with Mrs. Shanklin’s
relatives.
General-manager Boyd, of Mount Morgan,
is grieving over a son. No, not killed ; but
he will come back from the Dardanelles
with an empty coat-sleeve. Still, he did his
bit before his arm was shattered, locating a
Turkish gun which had been working a lot
of mischief.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
The price of sheep and cattle is jumping
every day at the Enoggera saleyards; and
the united weight of Ryan and his col-
leagues is insufficient to keep it down.

This 80-page BooK on the
Home Treatment of the
.. Hair and Dandruff s:
Written by Dr. NICHOLAS WE7ZLAW,
of St. Petersburg and London.
DO you suffer from hair-trouble? Are you a
dandruff-victim? Is your hair getting shorter
and shorter? Is it showing bald patches near
the crown or the temples? Are you worried because
your hair comes out on the brush and comb? If
you have ANY TROUBLE AT ALL, send for this book.
It gives little-known facts about dandruff, greyness,
baldness, falling hair, brittleness, oiliness, singeing,
massage, shampooing, etc.
It tells how in a fortnight you can see a marked
improvement in your hair and scalp. A month to
five weeks will find the dandruff gone for ever, am
your hair coming back to its former healthy condition.
These facts are indisputable. Thousands of people
know that the Volna Hair Treatment is the only
genuine method by which lasting good can be done for
the hair. Most of them were people who came to us
in desperation at the failure of “hair tonics” and other
treatments which they had tried.
Do you ask why we achieve these successes?
Because the Volna Home Treatment is based upon an
individual study by us of your own symptoms and com-
plaint. Because we prescribe correct remedies for
each case. Because we are not sellers of a “marvel-
lous” stock remedy. Because our information is
scientifically correct. Because we analyse and diagnose
your case as another professional man would diagnose
your bodily pains and symptoms. Because we give
you exactly what you need, made up in our Dispensing
Department especially for you.
To you who are seriously concerned about your hair,
we offer an absolute guarantee of relief from your
hair troubles. Our fee is most moderate. Our cures
never take longer than 90 days—often much less.

Pick : The small sawmill-owner in N.
b. Wales seems likely to be pushed out of
the timber industry by new forestry regula-
tions. The man with one bench-hand and
a bullocky works his plant to the time-table
of one day’s log-falling (during which the
mill remains idle) to three days’ sawing.
Ihe teamster is continuously engaged haul-
ing the logs or carting the sawn stuff. A
recently-issued order of the dept, has seri-
ously disturbed this routine. It requires
that logs felled are to lie at the stump until
measured by the ranger. To the big mill
proprietor employing many fallers, teams,
s-eam-punts. and railways, the regulation
means nothing beyond the more frequent
visit of a troublesome official; but to the
small man it means (1) many consecutive
days of . falling, until sufficient logs are
down to induce a visit from the ranger, who
piobably has a district 200 miles wide to
traverse, and will come along when it suits
aim >' idleness of team and mill while
the falling is in progress, though all the
time (3) rations for the team are being
consumed at £8 or £9 a ton. How comfort-
mg it is to know that there are parties in
1 arliament intent upon' safeguarding the
welfare of the small man !
* * * *
“Warre” : One of the changes wrought by
the drought will be the re-instating of the
despised stripper as a means of gathering the
wheat harvest. The combined harvester was
introduced as a labor-saver, but it’s the worst
giain-waster on record. A careless man can
scatter as much grain over the paddock as he
puts m the bags. And as these machines
become more labor-saving by developing a
wider cut, entailing eight to ten horse-
power, the greater will the waste be, because
the man who says he can drive eight horses
and attend to his machine is a sanguinary
war-correspondent. Features in favor of
the old stripper are that it keeps the pad-
docks clean,” and saves the “beeswing.”
Beeswing may not be a fashionable food, but
used with a little molasses and maize it
cuts down the cocky’s fodder bill.
JVlaoriland has been overhauling its fish
tind oyster accounts for the past 12 months
particularly at the Bluff and Stewart Island,
where the big, fat bivalves blossom for the
delectation of bookmakers and ballet
matrons. More than half the fish
caught, chiefly blue cod, was eaten
m Australia—444scwt. out of 8045 cwt
During the oyster season 24,793 sacks
ot the shell-fish were picked in the
south and of these 3285 were delivered
at Hobart and Melbourne (Sydney rarelv
sees Stewart Island oysters). The value of
the catch was £12,396, a great contrast to
the crop and value of the northern rock
? y i J™ the Hauraki . Gulf and Bay of
Islands 8361 sacks of him were harvested
and sold at £5725. Of this, £1664 was pro-
fit to the State, which since 1908 has warned
1 rivate Enterprise off the Northern beds and
worked them by the miserable system of
Sosh. This accursed method not only brings
in a profit each year, but conserves the beds.
Incidentally, the Southern beds are consid-
ered to be inexhaustible. So P.E. is allowed
to do its worst.
* * #
From the other end :
In a discussion here on ‘‘the oldest vessel afloat,”
J. F. Hogan as a patriotic Australian puts in a word
for the Edina, the Howard Smith ark which has
been travelling between Melbourne and Geelong from
the days of the prophet Jobkins. She was used as a
despatch boat during the Crimean War. That was
60 years ago, and even then she was no flapper. The
Jenny, built 128 years ago, is the oldest steamer
on the register of the British Board of Trade.
, A A 1 0 ?? te Bank of N. S. Wales,
dated 1844 and endorsed “Victoria House
ilarmer, draper. Pitt-street,” was sold the
other day in aid of the War Food Fund for
4° guineas. The “Farmer, draper” of the
endorsement was Joseph Farmer, the origi-
nal and in those" days sole proprietor of the
business that still carries the name The
secretary and cashier of the bank at that
time was John Henry Black, father of
itegmald J., one of the present directors.
Kodak : Some of these small suburban
shops are magnificent in their efforts to cap-
ture trade. Whilst wandering at large last
Sunday afternoon, I examined a fly-specked
window which had set out its stock of wares •
(1) a skipping rope, (2) pocket dictionary’
(3) packet of crackers, (4) official report of
German atrocities, (5) pair of spectacles to
read same with, (6) baby’s celluloid rattle
and (7) blank will form. Yet it is nuite
likely that the merchant who laid out these
baits is occasionally baffled by the sort of cus-
tomer who rushes in late at night clamoring
for rabbit traps and hair dye.
THE DIFFERENCE OF TEN-AND-SIX.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Upon a pound of butter, gently laid,
The grocer has delivered his account;
The morning chop has also brought a bill;
And there are other things of small amount—
A week is due upon the household sticks.
How great a difference is ten-and-six 1
For affluence sat on me like a lord
Last week. Above my dues I had to spare
A sweet half-guinea (it was duly spared),
And in a world that seemed by nature fair,
I gathered roses and I felt no pricks.
How great a difference is ten-and-six!
I know how, on his surplus, Holman feels.
Alas, this week the surplus is of debt;
A small half-guinea—but I see with gloom
The mounting bill that never may be met.
Some one must wait; some bill I cannot fix—
How great a difference is ten-and-six!
When dollars seemed as plentiful as pence,
And lightly went, but ever seemed to come,
With all the cash I felt no pleasure like
Ihe one with which I bore my surplus home.
But Fate is constant with his scurvy tricks—
How great a difference is ten-and-six!
Yet I have known hard times as well as good,
When meeting bills was outside sober thought;
And to a hell of cashless emptiness
A poor half-guinea joys of heav’n brought.
Joy or despair lies in Fate’s weekly tricks—
How great a difference is ten-and-six!

Winifred Honey, who annexed a Felton
-Bequest scholarship two or three years
/ent out one of the pictures de-
of her ~ a c °py. taken from a Rem-
brandt canvas at Amsterdam. Winifred
was hard at work in Holland when the
Hermans started pouring themselves into
Belgium, and as the atmosphere quickly
became oppressive she packed up her little
easel and fled back to London. Later on
when the situation straightened out a bit
she went back and finished the job with
one eye on the frontier and the other on
SLi wh .^ f -. Winifred’s days have been
mi,l d ™ :ident since leaving Australia.
The first, picture she set to work on was
} elasquez s V enus” at Manchester, but be-
tore she got through with that task the
suffragettes arrived and slashed the famous
nude.
Geelong is so determined not to be caught
napping nowadays that its town council has
just decided, in view of the many victories
the townspeople will be called on to cele-
brate, to lay in a stock of bunting for
decorative purposes. You can’t very well
beat that for calm confidence, either.
There is to be a big garden party to raise
f or wounded soldiers on September 4,
a r A; he , Rest ’ Abbotsford—the former home
of the departed Dick Rowe. The gardens go
right down to the river and are large and
adaptable for the purpose. Governor Stan-
leywdl preside at the fete and set the raffle
bail rolling, and the sweets-selling Sassietv
girl is already mobilising.
The Creswicks, a family of squatters who
are neighbors of the vice-regal Stonington
f hey fif r< J? wn ’ gave a theatrical
party for the Red Cross last week. The
Strolling Players (amateurs of considerable
swank) arranged the programme, and Every-
body— just Everybody—turned up. There
was not a Nobody in sight. If one had
intruded he would probably have crawled
under the sofa to restore the harmony of
things.
Belgian Consul Vanderkelen, Mrs. Alber-
tine Gay and Mrs. Malcolm Marsh are get-
ting up a benefit for 801, the Antwerp tenor,
le has his wife with him, a fair, delicate
tittle lady. She plays the charmingest
possible accompaniments. 80l was first-
tenor in the Antwerp Opera House for six
years. Musical Belgian refugees generally
are m a pitiable way. They are seldom fit
enough to fight in trenches or anywhere else,
their strength running mostly to hair and
genius.
Sam Mackay has given a piece of land, a
cottage and an orchard to the Red 'Cross
bund for raffling purposes. The place is at
Berwick, and was occupied by Mr. Mackay’s
overseer before the big house and stables
were sold to Andrew Chirnside. It is on a
neat triangle of land between converging
roads, and would make an ideal week-end
resort. Neighbors could not hear the occu-
pants snore nor be scandalised by the pop of
a cork in wee sma’ hours.
A Melbourne man—Mr. A. C. Shaw
ot the Kodak Co. —lately received a
letter from his sister, who is in
Servia. The missive had been opened
by a Servian censor, who had written
in blue pencil~( apparently it was the censor’s
writing); “Oh, glorious Australia! Oh,
Australia! ,1 was a professor of music
m Me bourne in 1880 and 1881,” and then
some illegible words. If that poor man ever
made any bad music for our fathers and
mothers he is suffering for it now. I wish
we could put some of our rabid pro-German
piano-pounders in his. place.
Howard Berry was one of the many bitten
by the: bogus cable. When Randall, the
adored son of the house, was supposed to be
m Egypt with the reinforcements, a cable
came asking for money. It was des-
patched in haste. A letter, turning up
immediately after, showed that the young
man had left Egypt some weeks before. The
money had gone to some schemer
who knew how to play a pathetic tune on
other people’s purse-strings.
-Chough many Melbourne mansions have,
as lately enumerated, become hash-joints or
desirable flatteries, a certain amount of out-
size housemaking still goes on. An acre or
so. of one-storey up-to-dateness is now- being
built near Ashburton, on the Outer Circle
line, by Percy Owen, an estate agent who a
few years ago started business in the Equit-
able Building-—and nearly every vacant lot
around Melbourne now carries a board with
the four large black letters. He married a
kindred business-soul, Edith White, who
founded the Austral Library, and built up
so tremendous a collection of books that she
became a highly-successful rival to “Mul-
leh’s” over the way.
There is to be a high-toned •war-show at
Cliveden on August 27. The Madden dame
is president, and Mrs. Stuart Murray and
Miss MdEvoy are doing the organising. The
programme for a lounge concert will be fur-
nished by amateurs and professionals, includ-
ing Daisy Jerome, Walter Kirby and the
Belgian tenor whose second name always
makes me nervous. For the unmusical there
will be assorted devilry—games of chance, 1
raffles, stalls and bridge in the dining-room.
McArthur. ICC., who had booked for a
trip to England with son Gordon, had to
haul his trunks, from the Orontes at the last
minute. Young Gordon (he was going to
join an Aviation Corps) thoughtlessly fell
sick, and so put the projected trip back a
few weeks.
Flemington course has been lent to the
soldiers ; but they will have to take a few
days off, .because I see the weights are out
for the next meeting on the V.R.C. list.
The “recruities” are sleeping in two of the
stands, and sing “Tipperary” in the bird-
cage.
The Pursy Chirnsides’ eldest hope and
glory, who was rushed from the Geelong
Grammar School into an English military
college, has blossomed into a subaltern in
the Bth Hussars. Father Pursy, who holds
the rank of captain, is engaged handling
transport waggons, and his wife has charge
of a hospital telephone exchange. Every-
body’s working now. If the Germans haven’t
been able to get to Calais they have nt least
made jobs for lots of people to whom pay-
night ordinarily means nothing.
Scotsbyterian parson Hume Robertson,
who knows his Egypt well, is spending his
little savings on a trip to Cairo. His idea
is to act as a line of communication between
wounded soldiers and anxious relatives here.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.
Keast, M.P. for Dandenong, recently made
a concise story of Victoria’s finances. The
interest bill for last year was, according to
his reckoning, £2.298,005. Seven years ago
it was only £1,873,609. All through the
State departments exes, have been piling
up. Excluding teachers, railway-men and
police, there has during the last six years
been an increase of 50 per cent, in the num-
ber of State employees. On one side of the
ri^ ra ls the'State Observatory, costing over
£4OOO a yearon the other side is Hunt, of
the Federal weather factory, doing much
same work.. At one end of Melbourne is
Statistician’s department, costing
±lO,OOO a year; at the other end is Knibbs
doing the same graft. But Keast didn’t
even then mention the. amount thrown away
on Governor Stanley and his outfit, with
G.-G. Ferguson on the spot available for
borrowing when it is absolutely necessary
that an imported- personage should lay an
Australian foundation-stone or perspire at
the job of opening a bazaar. Nor did Keast
mention a politician named Keast, who is a
member of one of 12 superfluous State
Houses of Parliament.
“Whitehall” on divorce (B.
u ij ) 1S we^come to his arguments, but
should not make the mistake of speaking of
Australia as a land where the law says
thus and tlrus. The law says many different
things ; in fact, any number of things up to
® lx ~which is the number of the States.
And if the law in Canberra and Papua and
the Northern Territory says some thing, or
three things, you must add to the number of
things which the law says in Australia. To
begin with, desertion as a ground for divorce
is utterly unknown in South Aus. In
other States the qualifying period varies
from two years onwards; and there are
other startling divergences. Australian
nationalism demands a uniform law. We
are one people, not six. And we don’t want
one complaisant State to set up a “Reno,”: to
which mismated pairs from severer States
may repair to be unyoked.
“Lobbyite”:—
A weird development of the scandalous agitation
in the N. S. Wales Labor party to hand-old'Federal
Government House over to the Stricklands is ithe
intrusion of the sectarian snake. Those members
whose constituencies have a strong R.C. vote,, or
who regard the R.C. vote as of. value- to. the party,
are in favor of the change. It is the opinion; of
the leaders of this section that, the militant R.C.’s
will forgive much in connection with the Govern-
ment’s education policy in consideration of a Gov-
ernor of their denomination being selected for the
distinction of occupying the .big house in Macquarie-
street. It seems a- strange point of view, but such
things are the commonplaces of the Party system.
Holman still holds to the views—rapidly becoming
unpopular in the party—that Federal- Government
House should be kept for one of those purposes for
which it was : resumed, and that it will be suicidal
for the Labor party, above all parties, to help per-
petuate in such a way the office which Labor is
pledged to abolish. But when Caucus votes Holman
is but one of a crowd.
' The Kaiser’s telegram to his sister, the
yueen of Greece, is a reminder of the long
ago when grandfather William used to
send piously-worded tidings to his old lady
at the time of the Franco-Prussian war.
VV hite-whiskered William was depicted by
“ a prayerful attitude on a
battlefield, with his eyes upturned to Heaven
Beneath the picture was the doggerel:
Dear beloved Queen Augusta,
We,have had another buster;
Ten thousand Frenchmen sent below—
Praise God, from Whom all blessings flow!
It was really the first Bill who founded the
him of Gott and Kaiser. Grandson William
merely registered a change in the title of the
firm.
Henry Noyes,, the small-arms factory-
planner, made what he declared to be his
maiden speech at Malvern (Vic.) the other
• evening. He did it well, too ; he merely, asked
the assembled patriots not to waste time
worrying because the other fellow didn’t seem
to be bustling enough, but to go and do some-
thing themselves. The advice came as a cold
douche to. a lot of people who had been
bleating indefinitely about Empiah and
shouting about what their relatives have
done.
‘Chemist” on the scandal in his trade:—
The U.S.A. and Japan are busy reaching out
after Germany’s commerce, while Australia, be-
witched by the words “contentious legislation,” slum-
bers the sleep of the doped. The glass industry
provides yet another instance of the Kangaroo miss-
ing the ’bus. Before the war shiploads of glass-
ware, including drug and medical bottles, measures,
flasks, beakers, test tubes, students’ chemical sets,
etc., were imported from Germany. Though that
source of supply is cut off, Australia does nor worry.
She will manufacture the goods herself 1 Not much—
not while there is a foreign country she can pur-
chase from! So Japan is making the most of her
opportunity, and finds Australia a good customer.
Britain, though her products in glassware hold pride
of place as to quality and wearing capacity, is not
getting our custom; the foreigner, working longer
hours for less wages, quotes cheaper prices!
Great is the goddess of Cheapness! If John
Bull cannot compete with the foreigner, what
chance has the high-wage, short-hour Australian now
that the tariff has been postponed ? The Japs are
to be commended' and not blamed for taking the tide
of fortune at the flood; but there is no excuse at all
for our traitorous legislators who have broken their
election pledges.

She wore a frock of other days, i -
A hat far larger than a plate,
While dames-who walked the city ways
In goods distinctly up to date ,
Wore something smart in black or brown
Not larger than a half-a-crown.
Her boots were old and patched a bit;
Her coat was branded “Nineteen-Two,”
And was a most preposterous fit;
Her dwarfed umbrella .wouldn’t I do.
The sex bestowed a seornful eye, ' .
And promptly voted her a guy.
Girls scoffed at her along the Block;
They guyed her north, south, east and west.
But now they dare no longer mock —
She wears a medal on her breast.

For courage grim before the foe!

Quite a Disfigurement, Used Cuti-
cura Soap and Ointment, Began
to Disappear, T rouble Gone Now,
34 Queens Parade, Devonport, Auckland,
N. Z.—“ Last year I suffered from pimples
and blackheads all over my face which
were quite a disfigurement to me and when
I scratched them they turned into sores.
We always keep Cuticura Soap and Cuti-
cura Ointment in the house so I thought
I would try them and after using the Cuti-
cura Soap and Cuticura Ointment as
directed for a short time, the pimples and
blackheads began to disappear. I kept on
using them and the trouble has gone en-
tirely now. I always recommend Cuticura
Soap and Cuticura Ointment to anyone
suffering from the same complaint.”

HAIR CAME OUT IN HANDFULS
104 Mill Hill Rd., Waverley.—“ After a
very serious illness my hair started to come
out in handfuls and my head was very
thick with dandruff. Some days I felt as
if I would go mad with the irritation. My
hair lost its natural colour and always looked
as if it was dirty. I used to apply the Cuti-
cura Ointment once a week and wash my
head with Cuticura Soap and in a very short
time they stopped my hair from falling
out and cleared my skin and I have ho time
now for any other than Cuticura Soap and
Cuticura Ointment.” (Signed) Mrs. Amy

PEBECO
Tooth Paste.
There are sermons in stones —•
also in teeth. We’ll choose the
latter for our text.
But if everyone used Pebeco
Tooth Paste there would be no
further need of sermons, preach-'
ments or parables on the proper
care of the teeth.
Pebeco Tooth Paste solves the
problem by ridding the mouth of
the enamel-destroying acids. “Acid
Mouth’’ is the dreaded thief which
experts now agree is the cause of
95% of all tooth decay. Pebecc
Tooth Paste arrests this acidity of
the mouth—even destroys the
acid-producing bacteria them-
selves.
You have not settled the
problem of your teeth by merely
keeping them white, clean and
polished. Pebeco Tooth Paste
will SAVE them. .

The just-dead Dr. Macfarlane, who for 30-
odd years looked after Tasmania’s mental
patients and was one of Australia’s most
dreply-learned alienists, had a notion that
he could generally tell whether a person was
rocky on his mental pins by. reading a few
of his letters. The person who was afflicted
with mental jerks nearly always showed it
by the abundance of his underlinings.

trolled by millionaire Abe Bailey. The
Leader has had many editors and many
policies. Prior to the Boer war it was run
by a Fat syndicate, its chief business then
being to get an explosion. Several of its
editors were arrested by Com Paul for sedi-
tion. After the burst-up the paper was
bought by the Cape Times people, and had
as editors, among others, It. ,T. Pakeman,
E. .1. Edwards, Richard Dawson, Albert
Cartwright, Prof. Edgar and A. D. Donovan.
After the big industrial rumpus in Johan-
nesburg two years ago, the policy was
changed from anti- to pro-Botha, on account
of the way Botha handled the strike. On
the outbreak of the present war the price
of both Leader and Post was reduced
from threepence to a penny. Not-
withstanding this, and a frenzied campaign
against German residents, the papers re-
mained unpopular, and evidently lost money.
The plant now goes to Capetown to turn out
a paper in the interests of Hertzog, the
leader of the so-called “Nationalists.” The
editorial, clerical and mechanical staffs will
be left behind : they were suddenly dumped
with pay in lieu of notice.
* * * *
There’s a dust-up on the Inky Way in the
North. Ilughenden Observer thus rebukes
the local Chronicle: —-
The “Sossidgewrap” wrote the the other day:
“Trust us for reliable news about the war —or any-
thing else.” And in the same issue, referring to
the footballers’ dinner the dirty lying rag also
wrote: “Before partaking of the good things pro-
vided by Host George Wilson.” Of course everyone
knows that the . caterer was Mr. G. Michel, of the
Bon Ton Refreshment Rooms, hut the bald-headed
liar who rails the “Wrap” couldn’t be truthful even
in so small a matter as that.
“E.T.” : Robert Blatehford, who for years
preached a German invasion, and, unlike
most prophets, is not now without a little
honor in his own country, was born a mum-
mer of mumming parents; and, although
he left the stage in early youth, lie has
never lost touch with the theatre —he is
much too good a bohemian for that. He
has even dabbled in dramatic authorship.
A comic opera of his (music by Clarence
Corri) toured the English provinces with
some success long before he took up jour-
nalism. When he founded the Clarion his
friend and colleague, A. M. Thompson, at-
tended to the sub-editing and dramatic
criticism (for years he had been “Dangle”
of the theatrical column in Manchester
Sunday Chronicle), as well as writing the
Christmas pantomimes for Bob Courtneidge.
When Courtneidge launched out in London
Blatcliford’s henchman came to the fore as
collaborator in the “books” of “The Dairy-
maids” and “The Arcadians,” and no man
in London was more pleased at the success
of these musical pieces than the warm-
hearted Blatehford.
An echo of a case that shook Maoriland
to its foundations in 1913 rumbled round
the island House of Reps, the other day
when the Auckland Observer presented a
petition for cash. The Observer, having
published a cartoon entitled “Justice Is Not
Blind,” allegedly reflecting on one of the
M.L. Judges,* the Attorney-General sprang
at the paper for seditious libel. After a pro-
longed fight, the Full Bench finally decided
that the law on which the prosecution rested
was obsolete. The paper now contends, that
the Attorney-General should have known
this, and that it should have been spared the
expense of defending itself. Therefore it has
handed Parliament a petition asking the
country to kindly satisfy Costs before the
ravenous animal entirely devours the pro-
prietors ; and Parliament didn’t make half
the satirical noises it would certainly have
made if the last man who was wrongly
accused of robbing a hen-roost had petitioned
the State to pay his expenses.
THE PITY OF IT!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I dare not sing a song which burns
And on the theme of passion turns . ;
I s,tjtie all my deepest yearns,
l’ve a Censor now:
I dare i.ofteil my wife she is
The one who makes my braS.n-p.ffn fizz.
You can’t put off that stuff on Liz,
Who is mv iegal frau.
“I can’t pursue Thought’s butterflies,
And write of other ladies’ eyes ;
The wifely prohibition ties
My former wand’ring pen.
Suppose, for instance, I should dare
To write of someone who is fair ?
My Liz is raven- locked —so there
I should be caught again!
“I find at times some slight relief
In sonneting the price of beef.
On butter I pour out my grief,
And weep for cheaper steak.
Thus, miserably, I disguise
The passion lit by foreign eyes.
It would not in the least surprise
Me if my heart should break!”
Thus-spake the poet unto me.
His heart was. bursting, I could see.
He took his pen and drearily
Began again with sneers.
This sonnet was addressed “To Bread,”
But he’d some lady in his head.
Perhaps she knew it when she read
And wept responsive tears.

Sentiments and Analyses.
DOPE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
efficacy of prayer is in the pray-er.
I I knew one wild, whirling prayer-
maker who was not so much mantis as
heliograph. 11 is was the energetic form of
supplication, and he had probably learnt it
in a gymnasium. In the cabin we shared
on a trip to Torres I would fall over him at
all hours of the day wearing out his best
trousers on the cabin floor. And one day he
was as continuous as a picture show, and
with as little audience as one because he did
not perform during the lunch hour —except
on the rations. On this day I wondered if
he had started in for 40 days and 40 nights,
and seeing the unspoken question, he said : —-
“I’ve lost a collar-stud, and I'm praying
1 may find it.”
“Have you looked for it?”
“Yes —everywhere.”
“You can’t have looked for it ‘everywhere’
or you’d find it. AA'as it gold or pearl?”
“It was bone.”
“And do you mean you would ask the
Master of the Universe to suspend opera-
tions in the launching of a new star to look
for a collar-stud that cost sixpence a dozen?”
lie said he would, and proceeded to repeat
his excellent imitation of the mantis, and the
heliograph. Later, he told me he had been
directed where to look for his ox-bone collar-
bollard, and had found it first try.
“But that only proves that before this
attempt you looked in places where it
wasn’t, and this time, by long elimination,
you looked in the place where it was.”
He said that the efficacy of prayer was
only understandable by believing souls, aud
went back to his imitations.
Now Professor Melchizedek is quite an-
other sort of praying wheel; though he re-
sembles most of them in that he is a blind
egoist—a devotee devoted to himself. He is
not really a professor, his occupation being
that of a tester and verifier of flower sect >.
but he knows a fair deal of botany, and
when the whisky gets in its fine work he to
everybody more than he knows. »o tnej can
him a professor because he knows little amt
professes to know everything. , .
At heart a good man, lie did ill; tor ins
disease was mental amaurosis. He could n°
see himself clearly; it was either through the
glass of egotism or the golden haze that rose
from his second whisky.
The morning was bright. The tops ot tlie
sugar gums waved like feathers in the sun-
light. Salvias flamed crimson in the garden
and life was very good. Professor Melchize-
dek said his prayers hurriedly that morning
for lie was in a hurry to be away and doin'--
anxious not to miss a moment of this daj.
and of the opportunities that die before
night.
He skipped to the railway and he skipped
from the train to the ferry and walked up
Gfeorge-street glad and gay, going to his work
as blithely as if it were dinner. All day lie
tested seeds, and gave them certificates of fer-
tility, or sent them to the dust-box, and by
afternoon he was so proud of having taken
tea with his lunch that he resolved to remove
himself from temptation that night, seeking
neither bar-room nor crony. Hereafter his
praying-wheel should be no barrel nor bottle,
but of the real Hindu kind. In the pursu-
ance of that good resolution he took his bag-
pipes and a bottle of chloroform and went to
hear a Wagner concert at the Town Hall.
Whether the bagpipes had sprung a leak
and couldn’t say anything to drown the con-
cert noises, or whether the chloroform evap-
orated, or whether he met a friend and the.
friend asked him to “Comovertlieroad” at
half-time, the Prof, will not say. Certainly
he went over the road, and “over the road
was as blood to a tiger.
At half an hour to midnight the Prof., full
of drink and information, and the desire to
impart the information, presumably to make
room for more drink, stopped at a Dago shop
in the vicinity of the Quay and swayed as
lie looked at the red lobsters and the brown
teal. He felt in his pockets and counted
11 pounds and 10 shillings in gold and some
silver.
“I will have a beccafieo,” said the Prof.
“I made a vow against lobsters. They make
a man look not like a gentleman even if lie’s
quite sober. A beccafieo for me.”
He entered the shop, his round, red face
beaming with benevolence and joy. He
smiled sweetly upon the fishmonger.
“The little birds in your beautifully-
arranged window,” lie said. "Are they
beccaficos ?”
"No,” said Athens. “This is teal —a sorot
of duck.”
“Pardon me! I call them beccaficos.
“No ! No ! Beccaiico, he is fig-eater—he
natif bird of Mediterrane- —this is common
Australian teal.”
“How much eaehV” demanded the Prof.,
all his politeness oozing.
“One shilling sixpence if we call him teal
—two shilling if beccafieo.”
“I say it is beccafieo —there are two shil-
lings.”
“All right.” said Athens. “ I think you
foolish mau. You pay sixpence to call teal
beccafieo. Veri foolish.”
“It is my business,” replied the Prof, loft-
ily. and shut his ears as he departed to the
Grecian scream that followed him.
“It is teal —common Australian teal—like
larrakin —teal stuffed with ’erba’. Beccafieo
is fig-eater —big long beak to eater the figlii.
You look at the teal’s face when you eat
him. Ha! ha ! You pay sixpence call him
beccafieo—suppose you pay four shillin’ I
let you call him ’orse.”
“It is a beccafieo,” said tlic Prof., and
sought a late hotel that knew him. He had
three drinks with a gentlemanly stranger
who hiccoughed without ceasing. The gentle-
manly stranger had a large and noisy garlic
sausage, which he had placed on the couch
next him, and the Prof, placed his beccafieo
(which was teal) next the sausage so that
the food might exchange ideas. The gentle-
manly stranger did not discover till next
morning that the parcels had also exchanged
themselves. lie and the Prof, drifted apart
after a few minutes’ conversation on becca-
ficos and the cultivation of pumpkins.
The Prof, took a cab to the Quay and
caught the last boat by the skin of his teeth.
"Bang!” said the deck-hand. “You near
missed it.”
“Bang,” said the Prof. “B h-a-n-g, pro-
nounced ‘bang,’ is the common Indian name
for the seed capsules and greater leaves of
the native hemp employed for making the
celebrated Indian uar-nar-narcotie called
hash-hash-liashereesh —hasclieesch.”
“You make a hash of it, anyhow,” said the
deck-hand with humor as obvious as it was
crude.
“The Indian hemp is a species of the
(lenus cannabis, ” said the Professor sternly.
“Search me!” said the man, and crossed
to the starboard side to be ready to tie her
up.
The Prof, seated lumself beside a little,
old, overdressed woman, all skin and grief,
dyed hair, feather boa and chiffon.
“The flowers of the bignonia, Madam.”
said lie, “mostly occur in terminate or axil-
lary pannicles. The”
“Don’t you dare speak to me—you —
you”
A dark, nasty little man interposed threat-
eningly.
“Your a wicked-minded old pig.” he said.
"Insultin’ a’ old lady like that!’
“I insult a lady? I? I was merely men-
tioning the structure of the bignonia—th<>
corollas are trumpet-shaped”
“Like your nose, you old waster,” said the
nasty man. “An’ for half a burnt match I'd
hit you on it with that sausage.”
“That,” said the Professor sadly, for lie
felt himself misunderstood—“that-is a becca-
fico.”
Then the boat tied up. and he went ashore,
burning with the injustice of it all and glad
at last to shake off the nasty mau who
hustled him and took him by the coat and by
the leg, using diabolical threats against in-
sulters of old ladies the while.
There was no train. The Prof, hired a
cab, and North Sydney seemed to be made of
steeples. The cabman obliginsrlv stopped at
three hotels, and at the last the Prof, had
no money, and when the cabman delivered

DON’T NEGLECT YOUR KIDNEYS.
The kidneys and bladder need occasional attention just as much as the bowels, especially
after colds, exposure and over-work, or when the kidneys are over-excited by beer, spirits or tea.
The brain rests while we sleep. So do the muscles. Even the digestive system slackens.
But the kidneys never rest. Night as well as day they keep on with their great work of filter-
ing the blood—if they did not you could not live more than a few days, for the urinous waste
left in the blood would poison the whole system.
That is why the early symptoms of kidney trouble are much the same as those of slow
poisoning—you feel as if you could fall off to sleep at any time of the day ; you seem to
have no energy, no ambition ; the ankles and limbs may be dropsical, the joints get rheu-
matic. The water contains a brickdust sediment, there is pain in emptyino- the bladder and
you may be obliged to seek relief every few minutes. "
When the kidneys are in a weak and exhausted condition they have no chance to rest
and pick up their strength. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills give them just the help thev
need. This remedy is solely for the kidneys and bladder ; its ingredients are of the hio-hest
quality and absolute puiity, and quickly help the kidneys to throw off the poisonous waste
and surplus water which cause dropsy, inflammation of the kidneys and bladder travel
stone, lumbago and rheumatism. & ’

SYDNEY PEOPLE CURED.
TWO YEARS CURED.
Mrs. W. J. H. Richards, 16 Cook Road, Marrickville, says: —“For about seven
years 1 was a martyr to kidney trouble, and only those who have suffered in this
way have any idea what I went through. My back used to often ache so much
that it felt like breaking, and every movement was positive torture. When the
pains were very severe, it was impossible for me to stoop, and 1 was almost
crippled. Other symptoms of kidney trouble were dropsical swellings on my legs
and ankles, and disordered secretions. During the time I suffered I was treated
by doctors and others, but they failed to do me any good. About six months ago
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were brought under my notice, so 1 made up my
mind to give them a fair trial. After using the first bottle l realised I had at
last got a medicine that was benefiting me, so I continued taking the Pills until L
was quite cured, using in all six bottles.”
Two years later Mrs. Richards confirms the above :—“I have had no trouble
with my kidneys since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me over two years ago
—a fact that speaks well for this splendid remedy.”
12 YEARS CURED.
Mis. AY. AY hitbread, Lllerslie, 389 Darling Street. Balmain, says:—“About
eleven years ago my husband suffered a lot from backache. The' pains were
awful ;in fact, lie was so bad that lie was unable to do work of any kind. It

lie looked around, and the sausage, hang-
ing by its own string from the footpost of

never happened when I brought home a crav-
nsh. I am resolved I will never bring home
a sausage again. Unsolved? I will never
take another drink of intoxicating fluid
while I live—-never ! Oh! sinner that I am.”
In a passion of remorse he ran all the
stages—adoration, confession, supplication
intercession and thanksgiving— talking of
himself in the third person as “poor Alfred
Melcffizedek, ; saying. “O Lord, Thou know-
est that in i nv sight I am but dust and ash-
bins. O Lord! Thou knowesf all things'”
And then proceeding to tell the Lord at great
length very many things which do' not
matter. And, finally, as a promise and a
bribe to have his own salvation compassed,
he said : “And Thine be all the glorv.”
And then he blessed himself and liis house,
blessed it to the north and to the east and
to the south and to the west; blessed it
upwards and blessed it downwards; blessed
it backwards and blessed it forwards ; blessed
it right and blessed it left; blessed it here
and blessed it there ; and blessed it this way
and blessed it that way. As Simon, the
Barefoot Friar would say: “O.ds Doxis
Gloriosis.”
And he took the day to witness, and
abased himself and prayed fervently, and
went out through the beauty of the sunlight,
clean and stainless as a new-born babe • for
himself had pronounced his absolution—him-
self had told himself that he could sin again
no more.
Of course, even a resolution has to have
its eye opened after a thick night. The Pro-
fessor had The One—not a wicked whisky
and soda, but an innocuous Manhattan cock-
tail.
That night he caught the last train safely,
liis nose was painted with St. Anthony’s
Fire, and he led a blushing crayfish by the
hand. In the morning he performed the
’“antis act all over again, and so back to
1 rinking, repentance and the clean sheet of
absolution.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
The Man Who Saved His Gear.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AT tlie time I was chief-officer of the
Flipflap, a large passenger steamer,
and we were lying over-night at
Fort Nonesuch. At about 11 o’clock the
second-officer and I were having a varn
before turning in, when the quarter-master
came to my room and reported that a small
steamer, the Coughdrop, lying at the pier
opposite, was on fire. We ran on deck and
found that she was blazing away merrily.
Now between us and the Coughdrop were
a couple of lighters from which we had been
loadipi cargo that day ; so, leaving the
second-officer to turn out our crew and get
a couple of hoses rgn, across these lighters,
I went up the wharf to'see if I could dig up
the night-watchman. I found him in a small
office about 50ft. from where the fire was
blazing, lie was a very old man, and being
a watchman was, <luite naturally, fast
asleep. lie looked very peaceful as he sat
there, with a big red muffler tied round his
ancient neck, and his venerable white whis-
kers being drawn into his mouth by tlie back
draught every time he snored. I simply
hated waking him, but it had to be done: so
I shook him, at the same time yelling into
his ear, “Here, wake up ! There’s a ship ou
fii e!”
It took some minutes for this to soak into
Father Time, but when it did lie hoisted
himself out of his chair and, seizing an enor-
mous stick, propelled himself in small cir-
cles round the office, cackling insanely : “Hey,
what! Ship afire? Where —where?”
I tried to get some information as to
whether there was a fire-alarm or telephone
handy, but all I could get was: “Hey, what!
Ship afire? Where—where?”
At last I left him and went out on the
wharf again. There I met the second-officer,
who informed me that as soon as they started
the pumps on the Flipflap the hoses had
burst. In the meantime he had dis-
patched a sailor up to the dock gates, to see
if there.was anyone connected with the Har-
bor Trust awake.
( We then went and had a look at the
Coughdrop. She was burning pretty fiercely
by this time, the whole of the part under;
ueath her bridge being a glowing hell. We
decided that something ought to be done
whilst we were waiting for the brigade to
arrive, and, looking round, we saw a row of
fire buckets in a rack. We knew that tliev
were fire buckets because they had “FIRE”
painted on them in large red letters, and to
remove any doubts on the subject there was
a notice over theih which read: “THESE
BUCKETS ARE ONLY TO BE USED IN
CASE OF FIRE.” Also several of them had
water in them, although I am inclined to
think that was an accident. So the second
and I grabbed a bucket in each hand and
lifted. That is all that happened, for the
rope handles came away in our lists, and
the buckets remained sitting quietly in their
rack like a row of hens.
However, it did not matter much, as .lust
then there was a loud c-lang! clang! clang !
and down came a big motor-engine, with
burnished brass and copper work shining in
the moonlight. As the main deck of the
Coughdrop was two or three feet below the
level of the wharf, the firemen had no diffi-
culty in getting at the tire, and very soon
had water playing on it.
It was at this point that Brugglesmith fell
into the action of the story. Although it was
after 11 o’clock at night a large crowd had
assembled along the edge of the wharf. They
were violently thrust on one side, and a very
drunken sailor forced his way through, bal-
anced for one perilous moment on the edge
of. the wharf, and exclaiming in a loud
voice, “Where’s my gear?” fell in a
heap on the deck. It was Brugglesmith.
We picked him up and sat him on a
hatch to recover his breath, which had been
knocked out of him by his fall. It was a
good strong breath, and was not damaged
to speak of. As soon as he had quite .recov-
ered it, he said fiercely, “Where’s my
gear?” and. springing up, made a dash to
get through the flames. As he was dis-
appearing into them one of the firemen
grabbed him, and threw him back on to the
hatch. “Ye fool,” he said; “d’ye
want to get roasted V”
Brugglesmith wagged his head owlishly.
“I want my gear,” he said.
For some time he sat on the hatch, with
his chin on his chest, repeating moodily: “I
want my gear.” Then, before anyone
could prevent him, he jumped to his feet,
lurched unsteadily across the deck, and dis-
appeared into the heart of the flames.
“(tor-blime!” exclaimed one of the fire-
men. “That finishes ’im, any’ow!”
Nothing could be done, so they went ahead
putting out the fire, and after another 10
minutes or so got it under. We then went
to look for the charred remains of Bruggle-
smith. There weren’t any—not a single
char. But as we gazed perplexedly at one
another there came a fearful commotion from
the after end of the little steamer; and even
as we looked an enormous canvas bag, such
as seamen use for carrying their effects in,
was projected violently from a small square
hatch in the deck. It was followed by the
head and shoulders of Brugglesmith. He
hoisted himself out of the hatch, picked up
his bag, and, standing on the rail of the
little steamer, threw it on the wharf. Then
he balanced himself unsteadily for two
breathless seconds, and fell into" the water.
Followed a great commotion on the wharf,
everybody giving advice, and no one doing
anvthing.
“Man overboard!”
“Throw ’im a rope someone !”
“Oarn’t no one ’ere swim?”
“Fetch a pleecercan !”
As a matter of fact, there was no danger,
because a couple of us simply leaned over th >
side, and grabbing Brugglesmith before he
could sink, hauled him up across the rail.
Precisely at this critical moment Captain
Blayng-Pynrie arrived on the scene. Captain
Blayng-Pyrine was (and still is) one of the
Port Nonesuch Harbor Trust officers, and
was the berthing master on duty that night.
He arrived when everything was all over,
and with only a very hazy idea as to what
was happening. However, on seeing the
crowd, and hearing “Man overboard!” he
assumed his most official manner.
“Now, then', stand back, please; stand back
there.” he said. “What’s the matter?” He
waved his arm imperiously to an underling
who accompanied him. “Jones, bring a life-
buoy !”
Jones dashed off and brought the lifebuoy.
It was apparently constructed with the idea
of supporting about 20 people, and seemed
to weigh about a hundredweight. Jones
staggered up with it and handed it to Blayng-
I’ynne, who. taking careful aim. hurled it at
Brugglesmith, who was still balanced across
the steamer’s rail.
It was a splendid shot. The massive thing
took poor Brugglesmith fairly on top of the
head, very neatly knocking him into the
water again.' Once again w r e proceeded to
salve him. Whilst we were hauling out for
the second time I had a sort of vision of
spending the remainder of the night in haul-
ing Brugglesmith out of the water, whilst
Blayng-Pynne sat on the wharf and took
potshots at him with a gigantic lifebuoy.
As a matter of fact, we never saw the
lifebuoy again. As soon as it fell into the
water it sank for ever.
We laid Brugglesmith on the wharf, and
as lie was quite unconscious owing to the
water he had swallowed, and bleeding from a
nasty cut on the head where the lifebuoy
had struck him. we proceeded to administer
the treatment for the apparently drowned.
After some time he showed signs of life, but
still remained insensible. The brigade had
long ago departed, and the crowd, seeing that
Brugglesmith was not a corpse, melted away
in an aggrieved manner, much as though they
had not received fair entertainment for their
money. By the way they looked at Bruggle-
smith I could see they felt annoyed.
Soon we were left quite alone with him.
He lay on his back with his arms stretched
out, his face turned up to the calm, peaceful
moon; and as he showed no further signs of
coming to life, it occurred to someone that
it would be as well to ring up the hospital.
This was done, and presently a motor-ambu-
lance crept silently up. We lifted poor, wet,
battered old Brugglesmith and put him safely
inside.
Just as the ambulance was moving away
he came to life. Lifting his head, and
gazing at us reproachfully with one beery
eye, he murmured in a feeble voice: “Where’s
my gear?”
We were too overcome by emotion to an-
swer him, but simply picked up the bundle
and made of it a pillow for his wounded
head. The ambulance then moved off. But
as Brugglesmith receded from us we could
hear his voice, growing fainter and fainter
in the distance, calling plaintively : “Where’s
my gear?”
