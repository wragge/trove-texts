CAUTION. —The large sale for “Eumenthol

tions being manufactured under the name of
menthol and other jujubes. It is important,
therefore, when buying, to be sure and get
HUDSON’S “Eumenthol Jujubes.” You may
be asked to buy other jujubes, and be told they
are “just as good” as Hudson’s “Eumenthol
Jujubes.” This proves that these imitations
and substitutes have no reputation of their
own, and can only be sold on the good repute
and high character of Hudson’s "Eumenthol

Backblock Ballads
“Den” needs no introduction to Aus-
tralia. For Backblock Ballads and O.V.
contains the Austral aise, and “Den” is
our unofficial laureate. Readers of this
volume will be glad to see that this blanky
classic has been further enriched by other
stanzas. But not for this achievement alone
should the book be in the hands of eveny
bloke out-back. For “Den” bubbles with
unforced humor, he possesses a diabolical
dexterity in rime and metre, and he is prob-
ably the least artificially humorous of the
many Australian contributors of topical
verse. It is true he runs to length: even
in the two selections given above this page
found it necessary to lop off what it regarded
as rather unnecessary stanzas. His verses
remind one of his “Juno Sue” :
She didn’t ’ave no width, this piece —
This elongated piece:
The figger that she ’ad was mostly length.
I tell you, she reminded me
Of one perpetual lease
That doesn’t cease.
Now, ave you got ’er strength?
But in this prosaic continent poetry—and
humor —is measured by a foot-rule, and the
longer a contributor is the longer he will be
able to live. And “Den’s” humor is not
merely typographical; nor is he confined to
the back-blocks:—
Me! that has barracked tarts, an ’ torked an ’
larft.
An’ chucked orf at ’em like a phonagraft!
Gorstrooth! ! seemed to lose me power
o’ speech.
But, ’er! Oh, strike me pink! She is a
peach!
The sweetest in the barren! Spare me days,
I can’t describe that diner’s winnin’ toays.
The way she torks! ’Er lips! ’Er eyes!
’Mjv hair! ....
Oh, gimme air!....
’Er names ’s Doreen. . . .An’ me—that thort
I knoo
The ways uv tarts, an ’ all that smoogin'
game !
An’ so I ort; fer ain’t I known a few?
Yet, some’ow....l dunno. It ain’t the
same.
I carn’t tell wot it is; but all I know,
I’ve dropped me bundle — an’ I’m glad it’s
so.
Fer when I come ter think o’ wot I’ve
been....
’Er name’s Doreen.
And;
“/ wish’t yeh meant it, Bill.” O ’ow me
’eart
Went out to ’er that ev’nin’ on the beach.
I kneio she weren’t no ordinary tart,
My little peach!
I tell yeh, square ’n’ all, me ’eart stood still
To ’ear ’er say, “I wish’t yeh meant it, Bill.”
These extracts are all from a lyrical se-
quence entitled “The Sentimental Bloke,” in
which the poet depicts, with inimitable
humor and tenderness, the courtship of Bill
and his_ Doreen. “The Stoush o’ Day,” in
this series, is a brilliant description of the
daily prize fight between the White Hope,
Day, and the Nigger, Night. Its length
precludes its quotation here. But there is
room for its moral: —
An’ square an’ all, no matter ’ow yeh start,
The commin end of most of us is — tart.
Poetically, these four lyrics are the finest
things in the volume.
Though much of his verse is in dialect,
this fact need not dismay the gentle reader;
for the poet has thoughtfully provided a
glossary. From this we learn that chap
is “any male personage below the rank of a
personage.” That cow is “a thoroughly de-
spicable person, place, situation, thing or
circumstance,” ana that a fair cow is an
utterly obnoxious and otherwise inexpress-
ible person, etc. Also, that the superlative
of crook is dead crook; that Fatville is “the
fabled abode of the Tories”; that strike me
pink may, if necessary, be translated as
“goodness gracious.” Under the heading
Stoush, “Fisticuffs,” we learn: “ Scrap is
generic, and may be applied to all violent
conflicts, whether dog fights, pitched battles
or prolonged wars. Lash implies much bru-
tality, and the employment of weapons not
necessarily lethal. A mill is usually a glove
contest. Stoush is a orderly form of
fistic combat; job or biff usually implies a
single blow.” And for Wowsers, the poet
kindly supplies this note: “Where a dash
replaces a missing word, the adjective blessed
may be interpolated. In cases demanding
great emphasis the use of the word blooming
is permissible.”
WEARY.
Aw, I’m sick o’ the whole darn human race,
An’ I’m sick o’ this mundane ball;
I’m sick o’ the sight o’ me brother’s face,
An’ his works an’ talk an’ all;
I’m sick o’ the silly sounds I hear,
I’m sick o’ the sights I see;
Omar Khayyam he knew good cheer,
An’ it’s much the same with me.
Gimme a bit of a bough to sit
Beneath, an’ a book of rhyme,
An? a cuddlesome girl that sings a bit,
But don’t sing all the time;
That’s all I ask, an? it’s only just;
For it’s all that I hold dear —
A bough an’ a book an’ a girl an’ a crust;
That, an’ a jug o’ beer.
Then I’ll cuddle me girl an’ I’ll quaff me ale,
As we sit on the leafy floor;
An’ wheat the book an’ the beer jug fail,
I’ll cuddle me girl some more.
For jugs give out an’ books get slow,
But you take my tip for square —
Though the bough an’ the book an’ the beer
jug go,
The girl, she’s always there....
I’m sick of the sound o’ me fellow’s voice;
I’m sick o’ his schemes an’ shams;
O’ trying to choose when there ain’t no
choice,
An’ o’ darnin’ several dams;
So. gimme a girl that ain’t too slow.
You can keep your book of rhyme,
An’ your bough an’ bread an’ your beer.
Wot O!
An’ I’ll cuddle her all the time.

lads and Other Verses.” (Cole, Melb.)
Germany
The shrewd and unprejudiced criticism of
a cosmopolitan American is brought to bear
. .v
on Germany and the Germans _ (Duckworth,
P er Eymock’s Library) by Price Collier,
who recently subjected England and the
English to the same scrutiny. Price Collier
is no Foster Frazer. He knows both Eng-
land and Germany from the inside, and his
comparisons have the vividness of the ob-
servant outsider. But he has brought a Teu-
tonic thoroughness, though not a Teutonic
dulness, to his task, since he requires COO
pages to limn for us his impression of
modern Germany.
In his introductory chapters, dealing with
the history of the hundreds of petty States
that have been at lagt welded into the some .
, . .. . , , „
what lim P confederacy known as Germany,
Collier wisely emphasises the fact that Ger-
many ig stiU a country where State Rights
flourish; and that consequently German
pa * r !°t lsm ’ as distinct, say, from Bavarian
P atn °tism, 1S of such recent growth that in
ever y possible way open to a paternal
government it requires to be officially and
even officiously stimulated and nursed,
Consider the situation of Germany—a
small country with a barren soil, surrounded
by a r j n g 0 f enemies, a spot that for cen-
„ „ .
, e was a cock-pit of war, a country
aose peoples were divided up into hostile
States, and the marvel of modern Germany
must be acknowledged. Yet even the
mailed fist cannot guard modern Germany
from her weaknesses, for they are within
her. Her people still are tribal rather than
national; this new cock in the barn-yard
has not had time to learn even barn-yard
manners; and patriotism is such a new thing
that it has had to be hammered into Germans
by that Prussian fist. What the Germans
need most of all, in the light of their his-
tory, is national self-confidence. The rat-
tling of the sabre helps them wonderfully
to that self-confidence. They want: —
Twenty-five years of peace to enable them
to recover from their beatings and humilia-
tion ; a powerful army and navy to give
them a sense of security... .a ruler who
holds ever before their eyes their ideals and
the unfaltering energy required of them to
attain them.... What nation would not be
self-conscious after such dire experiences!
What nation would not be tenderly sensi-
tive as to its treatment bv neighboring
Powers! What nation would not be even
unduly keen to resent any appearance of an
attempt to jostle it from its hard-won place
in the sun?.. ..1 have the greatest sympathy
with the present Emperor in his capacity
as war-lord, and in his insistent stiffening
of Germany’s martial backbone.
We are apt, too, to look upon Germany as
a democratic country. Look, for instance,
at the rapidly increasing Socialistic vote!
The Empire of Germany is governed by
one man, who declaims his independence of
the people and admits his responsibility to
God a10ne.... How vapid is the talk about
what the German people will or will not
do; whether they will or will not have war,
for example. We shall have war when the
German Kaiser touches a button and gives
an order, and the German people will have
no more to say in the matter than you and I.
d*
Price Collier is consumedly interested in
clothes. In Berlin, with the exception of
the well-groomed officers, the inhabitants
are “almost grotesque in their dowdiness.”
He speaks of:—
The awkward, slouching gait,' as of men
physically untrained; the enormous propor-
tion of men over 40, who follow behind their
stomachs and turn their toes out at an
angle of more than 45 degrees, whose necks
lie m folds over their collars, and whose
whole appearance denotes an uncared-for
person and a negligence of domestic hygiene.
....Their awkward and annoying atten-
tions to women alone on the streets; their
rudeness in pushing and shoving; the gen-
eral underbred look, the slouching gait, the
country-store clothes, hats and boots the
sweetbread complexions as of men under-
exercised and not sufficiently aired and
scrubbed... .their fierce gobbling in the res-
taurants ; their lack of small services and
attentions to their own women when they
go about in public with them their
habit of straggling about in the middle of
the streets, like the chickens and geese on
a country road; all these things I have
noticed, but I must admit the surprising
personal conclusion that I have grown to
like the people.
Germany will surely be grateful to Price
Collier for his condescension. Berlin is too
new a capital, and the Germans are too new
a race to know how to behave in cosmopolitan
society. Yet the police sergeant of Berlin has
to pass an examination in the history of
the House of Hohenzollern from the time of
the margraves to the present time, and
“there are more Shakespeare plays given in
Germany in a week than in all the English-
speaking countries together in a year.”
Nevertheless Price Collier was worried over
the fact that Germans have “no backs to
their heads, emphasised nowadays by the
fact that many men wear their hair clipped
close to the head,” and no chins—“the lack
of chins in Germany is almost a national
peculiarity.” He vaguely connected the
missing portions of German anatomy with
the German prowess in, and love of, the
nebulous arts: music, philosophy, etc.
In no other country in the cultured group
of nations is the animal man so naively
vain, so deliciously self-conscious, so un-
trained in the ways of the polite world, so
serenely oblivious, not merely of the rights
of women, but of the simple courtesy of the
strong to the weak. It is the only country
I have visited where the hands of the men
are better cared for than the hands of the
women. .. .
These gross manners are the result of two
factors in German life. They are a poor
people, only just emerging from poverty,
slavery and disaster; poor not only in pos-
sessions, but poor in the experience of how
to use them. They do not know how to use
their new freedom The abject defer-
ence of the women, who know nothing better
than these parochial masters made them
insupportable. The other factor is the rigid
caste system of their social habits
They do not play together, or work together,
or amuse themselves together.
In his interesting description of university
life in Germany, the author points out that
“Germany is gone over with a veritable fine-
tooth comb of education.” But training the
minds of a population does not give a nation
the solution to the problems of civilisation—
as Germany is rapidly finding out.
Germany has trained her whole popula-
tion into the best working team in the
w0r1d.... It requires a politically tame
population to be thus driven. The danger-
ous geographical situation of Germany,
ringed round by enemies, has made submis-
sion to hard work, and to an iron auto-
cratic government, necessary.
They submit so much that in Berlin they
are not allowed to swing their canes or
umbrellas when they walk; and no Berlin
shop can advertise or hold a bargain sale
without permission of the police. The
changed prices must be affixed to the goods
four days before the sale for inspection by
the police, and only two such sales are per-
mitted a year.
And the more they are uniformed and
decorated and ticketed and drilled, and
taken care of, the better they like it, and
the more contented these people are. Over-
organisation has brought this about
Germany is getting to be a very tired-look-
ing nation. One hears almost as little
laughter in Germany as in India.
The German workman is already so
harried by petty officials, so entangled in the
ropes of insurance, so branded by the police,
and he has permitted to increase such a host
of guardians, that revolt or revolution is
practically impossible. Counting the army,
navy and officials, there are three million'
officials in Germany one policeman to
every five adults. And these three million
policemen, armed with lethal and legal
weapons, are inflexibly and unalterably for
no change. ... I have said that the popula-
tion is well fed, well clothed, and well looked
after. Of course they are. No slave-owner
so maltreats his slaves that they cannot work
for him !
Jt
But this tired, over-driven, over-coddled
nation possesses a valuable tonic —the Ger-
man army.
The German army is the antidote to this
lack of physical discipline, this lack of
strenuous physical life. The army takes the
place of our West, of our games, of our
sports; just as it takes the place of Eng-
land’s colonies and public schools and games
and sports. When looked at in this way,
when its double duty is recognised, the enor-
mous cost of it is not so material. The ex-
pense of the German army is not greater
than our armies, plus what we spend for
games and sport and colonial adventure
What Collier saw of the German army, in
its character of citizen-maker and Sandow
exerciser, converted him to the wisdom of
compulsory service.
It is the best all-round democratic uni-
versity in the world; it is a necessary anti-
dote for the physical lethargy of the German
race; it gives a much-worried and many-
times beaten people confidence.
But, as a civilisation, as an example for
other peoples to follow, German civilisation
is hlready found out. In the modern world
the Prussian method won’t do.
The Germans have not grown, they have
been forced. The very barrenness of the
soil, the ring of enemies, the soft moral and
social texture of the population, have, s*
their little knot of rulers think, made neces-
sary these harsh, artificial forcing methods.
The outstanding proof of the artificiality of
this civilisation is its powerlessness to pro-
pagate. Germans transplanted from their
hot-house civilisation cease to be Germans;
and nowhere in the world outside Germany
is German civilisation imitated, liked, or
adopted. Germans become English (and
Australian) citizens, no Englishmen (or
Australians) become Germans; millions of
Germans have become Americans,. n»
Americans become Germans.
There is no fear that that helmeted frown
with its brushed-up moustache is going to
Teutonize, or Prussianize, the world. It is
a browny-yellow grin in a smooth, slant-eyed
face that we must watch.
Jt
A useful addendum to Germany and the
Germans is F. W. Wile’s Men Around the
Kaiser: the Makers of Modem Germany
(Heinemann). The author represented The
Daily Mail at Berlin, and his character
studies are done with journalistic slickness
and despatch. Each of the 31 men described
is illustrated by a good portrait; and the per-
sonalities chosen are such as could not pos-
sibly be uninterestingly written about. A
few of the better known names will indicate
the character of the work: Admiral Yon
Tirpitz (the creator of the Navy), Zeppelin,
August Bebel, Max Reinhardt, Richard
Strauss, Maximilian Harden, Hauptmann,
Paul Ehrlich. The public likes personali-
ties, and here is a new world full of inter-
esting subjects for the eager interviewer.

sorry to find you so weak
and ill. Just take ‘Win-
carnis* three times a day
and you will quickly get
well. * Wincarnis *is really
wonderful. 1 have un
bounded faith In It.”
“I am delighted to seo
you out of doors again and

"Ohl lam go thankful
to be well again. Thanks
to yon and * Wincamia,*
I am now completely re-
stored to health. It is
Weakness overcome, Ansemia remedied,
111-health banished, Lost Vitality restored.
Every wineglassful of “Wincarnis”
creates a definite amount of new
strength, new vigor, new and
new life. And this is the reason:
“Wincarnis” (the wine of life ) is a
tonic, restorative, bloodmaker and nerve
food. Its first effect is to promote a
feeling of invigoration. Then it en-
riches and revitalises the blood, soothes
and feeds the nerves, rebuilds the
wasted tissue I' the body, and sur-
charges the whole system with renewed
vigor and vitality. That is why every
wineglassful of “Wincarnis” makes you
stronger and healthier than you were
before. If you suffer from Anaemia,
Sleeplessness, Brain-fag, Weakness, De-
bility, Exhaustion, Lowered Vitality,
Nervous Disorders, or if you are merely
“run-down” or “out-of-sorts,” we urge
you to commence taking “Wincarnis”
to-day. Bern ember that “Wincarnis”
has an unrivalled reputation of nearly
thirty years’ standing—that it is recoin-
mended by over 10,000 doctors—and
that countless thousands of sufferers
have proved, beyond question, that it
gives new life to the invalid, renewed
strength to the weak—increased vigor
to brainworkers- —and a wealth of health
to everyone.
Will you try just one bottle?

To-day Is the best day to commence taking " l Vlncarnis. ’ Buy a bottle to-day from your Wine Merchant
or Licensed Chemist or Grocer, and test its Marvellous Strengthening Properties .

The Inky Way.
The latest splash on the Inky Way is made by the
Commonwealth Engineer. Australia begins to be
almost certain it could make a clothes-peg if it tried.
The shameful purpose of the Engineer is to encour-
age Australia in such wild ideas, and to provide a
means through which clothes-peg and other engineers
may swap hints which brains may turn into bread,
beer, butter and other edible substances. Peter G.
Tait is the publisher.

Theophilu* Carey, just dead at Claremont
(W.A.), crowded a lot of journalism into his 68
years. Starting at Portland (Vic.), he founded the
Standard, at Mount Gambier (S.A.), and the
Methodist Journal (now Christian Common-
wealth) in Adelaide. After a long interval of mere
commercial printing in South Aus., he became editor
of the Christian World, in Sydney, about 20 years
ago, then gave Tasmania a turn as editor of the
Launceston Examiner, and, as already remarked, he
finished up as a resident of Westralia.
* * * *
“Sparrow”: The country newspaper office is a
miscellaneous sort of bureau. The other day, at
Wonthaggi, it was even charged with being a sly-
groggery. The unlicensed sale of the Curse took
place, it was alleged, in the printing den, where
half a dozen thirsty toilers were discovered by a
policeman with a demijohn of beer in their midst.
The boss proved that he did not accept money for
the beer- —-he explained that it was purchased on the
previous evening and paid for by tarpaulin muster.
He didn’t lose his £25, but a very much upset
editor is now a teetotaller.
“Green Ink”: The copy-pooling system in Sydney
got another black mark recently, when two good
pressmen were hurled into the street by their respec-
tive bosses. The system is one in which the pro-
prietors play with a double-headed penny, the other
fellow losing all the time. It works out this way:
A reporter is scheduled on the duty book for any-
thing up to six or seven Courts, which means, of
course, that he must depend upon somebody to help
him through. It may be that there is very little
doing in any of his assigned jobs, and, in that case,
he can run all day from one tribunal to the other,
hoping to be in the right place if anything unlisted
happens, such as a slamdammering between counsel
and Bench, an unexpected judgment or motion, or
what not. But it mostly turns out that he can give
his patronage to, say, two Courts. If he is raw at
the game he applies to his staff-manager for help to
do the others, and in nine cases out of 10 is told
that nobody can be spared, and he must do the best
he can. The best he can do in the circs, is to go to
several brother scribes and borrow their copy. Thus
the pool system has been built up. Men help each
other as they can. And the bosses know it. Even
the most thick-headed boss (and there are a few at
large) is dead certain, when half a dozen or more
Courts are “covered” by one reporter (sometimes a
junior), that it has not been done by second sight.
But that certain knowledge makes no difference to
the boss. If he finds that the opposition boss’s rag
has a story which his own hasn’t got, he demands an
explanation; if a mistake (presuming it is costly)
is made, he is outraged. When the pool system is put
forward as an excuse, it is invariably repudiated. In the
ease- mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph,
none of these remarks may apply; on the other hand,
they may. In any case, if the Australian Journalists’
Association is wise it will see that the pool system^,
goes out. The bosses repudiate it. Then the A.J.A.’s ’
business is to take care that they don’t make use of
what they say they have no use for.

“Wrong Font”: With every spring new pap ergo
are threatened in Melbourne. This time two are
mooted. One is the usual Labor daily that is to
come, but is a long time about it; the other is in
the mind of a private syndicate which has pulled
together some promises and a fair amount of actual
cash to promote another evening sheet. It is about
time something brought a little zest into the columns
of the ancient Herald. Incidentally, the buying-
off of the Sydney Sun’s threatened outburst has
caused pain among some Herald shareholders. They
view it, perhaps rightly, as akin to the Ethelred act
of buying off the Danes, and merely an incentive to j
further bluffs. The next annual meeting promises
to be interesting.
The Bulletin’s Old Soldier philoso-
phises : The July Blackwood supplies a
significant Frontier item :
A party was detailed to hold the stockade, guard
our wounded and the large quantity of weapons we
had secured; and with them was left the Indian
Sub-Assistant Surgeon to render medical assistance.
Many of these are most gallant men, but he, unfortu-
nately, belonged to the educated non-fighting races of
India, and was not a fire-eater! I sent for him to
try and save the life of one of the enemy who ap-
peared dangerously wounded, but could get nothing
out of him save “He is dead, sir,” uttered at a
safe distance and without any attempt at examina-
tion of the patient, who was really very much alive.
As our expert in medical science was shivering with
funk, we were obliged to administer first aid our-
selves, but I could not help wondering at a policy
which permits of valuable lives being entrusted to
such men.
What ridicule such an episode casts on the
policy of equal rights and opportunities to
natives of every race, cast'6 or creed ! For
that episode is lamentably typical, as every
Anglo-Indian, or soldier who has seen ser-
vice in “the Shiny” will admit. Among
Europeans it is common to find a bookish,
studious man, when the occasion arises,
prove a daring fighter. With the Asiatic it
is not so. The “Khayast,” or man of the
writer caste, is faithful to his book, his pen
and inkhorn. but he shudders at the idea cf
going where bullets are flying about, and if
he is taken into such places he will fail
degradingly. His tragedy is that he has
sucked in with his mother’s milk the idea
that it is no part of his business to risk his
skin. India holds scores of millions of his
sort, and that is the real reason why the
British Raj is Unassailable.
HAIRINESS AND GODLINESS.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
Bald men are generally lacking in reverence,
spirituality and religious feeling. Evangelists always
have splendid heads of hair, so have all prominent
churchmen. A great American said recently that
religion was the greatest hair tonic. —
—Age correspondent.
The bard is bald. His raffish nut
Is minus husk, absurdly bare ;
It feels the breath of winter cut;
But now that holiness means hair
To lisping hymns he’ll tune his lay,
And in the church each seventh day
He'll lift his mellow voice in praise,
And always skate
A votive thrummer on the plate,
A brand new crop of wool to raise.
’Tis true he has a horrid past,
That at his heels the demon grins—
A scalp exposed to the blast
Is punishment for many sins—
But gentle pastors tell the horde
Repentance brings its sure reward.
So I’ll repent. Observe, it’s done,
With eyes cast down,
Not for the heavenly, golden crown,
But for a mundane hairy one.

Dangers of Varicose Veins.
Few people realise until too late how very dangerous to their existence Vari-
cose Veins are. If you suffer from these veins, or even have them, let us send you
a free book describing their dangers, and more particularly the VECSEY METHOD
of curing them. Hundreds endorse it, as it is purely a home treatment, and does
not require laying up, and is entirely harmless. No one who has varicose veins or
ulcers should delay an hour in obtaining full information on the subject. We
have treated and cured hundreds, and can probably do the same for you, once we
know your condition. GUARANTEE GIVEN IN EVERY CASE ACCEPTED.
In some of the worst cases known’ even where the victim has been unable to
walk, the patient has been restored to his feet inside three days, and a few weeks
under treatment has absolutely healed and banished the ulcers and permanently
cured the varicose veins, so that not a sign, except slight scars, remains to show
where the trouble originally existed. A painless cure without laying-up is, under
the circumstances, a positive boom to humanity.
Send 2d. stamp for free book of full particulars, or call for free consultation.
Very few cases are incurable. Write or call to-day. Hours: 10 a.m. to 4 pm.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A Romance of Verity.
The slender, pallid moon had hung
Her crescent in the sky,
The fading sunset lights were flung
Along the hill-top high,
And Jane and I were far too young
And kind to tell a lie.
We sat that evening on the shore
Beside the shining deep,
And watched the freight the waters bore
By cape and islet creep,
Where skimming prow and plashing oar
Disturbed the liquid’s sleep.
We felt that it was good to sit
Upon a quiet stone,
To see the homing people flit
And leave us all alone ;
For waists and arms will sometimes fit.
If young and nicely grown.
The sun had drawn his last red ray
Out of the western sky,
And where the east was hushed and grey
One small star winked its eye.
The large, dark world appeared to say,
“The time has come to sigh.”
We sighed. It was a pleasant sound,
The waters understood,
The trees and bushes clustered round
Appeared to think it good,
The growing night approved, and bound
Us with her velvet hood.
The lamps were lit, lest in the dark
The ships their way should miss.
We knew that the Domain and Park
Were bright on nights like this :
We heard the soft, kind gloom remark,
“The time has come to kiss.”
We kissed. It was a pleasant thing
And far removed from crime.
The wet weed heard our warm lips sing,
And knew the ancient rhyme
To sounds that little birds of spring
Repeat at nesting-time.
So all the night was very gay,
And all the dark was kind.
The eyes of men were far away.
But here the world was blind,
Or blind enough to seem to say
It really didn’t mind.
And long we sat beside the foam
That rippled chill and wet
Beneath the wide and starry dome
After the moon had set,
Till Jane remarked: “We must go home,
Come, Mary, let us get.”
We got. The ferry steamer lay
That rocky point hard by.
We stepped on board and passed away
From dream, and kiss, and sigh—
Two simple maidens young and gay
Who could not tell a lie.

MARY McCOMMONWEALTH.
The Plodder.
“It’s work, work, work!” sighed the long,
sad slab of the tired fireworking breed,
With his shoulders sloping to east and west
and his chin-crop gone to seed ;
He stood four-square to a well-worn post
and grumbled with all his might:
‘lt’s nothin’ but graft ’n’ toil all day, and
yakker from morn till night!”
“You’ve got ter toil for yer bloomin’ crust!”
he grizzled, and paused to groan,
As he rearranged his restless feet on a large,
convenient stone.
His breath came up in a long, long gasp
from his hollow and heaving chest,
While he cursed his lot with a deep-drawn
yawn and continued to take a rest.
“All toil ’n’ graft!” he remarked again,
“yes, work till yer d—d well grey,”
And the leaner set a match to his “fag” in a
placid and peaceful way.
Then his pal, with sympathy, asked: “’Ow
long ’ave you battled like this for
bread ?”
And the toiler smothered a painful sigh:
“Begin ter-morrer,” he said.

A Battery Truck Crane
i
--
Severe tests, covering an extended period at the
Bush Terminal Company, New York, and at the
Schenectady factory of the General Electric Com-
pany, and also at the No. 12 dock, Melbourne, have
proven the great worth of the Battery Truck Crane.
It is now offered to those who wish to extend the
storage capacity of a given floor space, or reduce
the cost and time of handling, freight, castings,
6tc.
The Battery Truck Crane is an automobile battery
truck, with an electric crane mounted in the front
end. The operator has complete control of the
crane and vehicle.
THE CRANE WITH A 60-MILE BOOM.
The Truck Crane can go a moderate distance, and
get back, with a load on its hook, quicker than the
same load can be lifted on to any other kind of
vehicle. It does the work of from 3to 30 horses
and drivers, or on hand work from 5 to 14 men.
This truck has moved one million pounds of small
package freight 600 ft. in 19 hours, and 600,000
pounds of cotton one half-mile in a day.
The truck has proved itself well adapted for service
between cranes in shops, for handling material
between shops, or in storage yards not covered by
cranes. Send for Battery Truck Crane Bulletin
No. 4892, or Test Reports on Tests, made at No. 12

Your Dealer’s Knowledge
of Arms
YOU look to your dealer to be at least well
informed on guns of all makes* And you
are a little more confident that he can
aid you in choosing the right shot-gun or rifle
when you see the more modern arms displayed
in his showcase or window*
Sportsmen and dealers all over Australia
have been quick to recognise the thoroughbred in
the new Remington-UMC repeating arm.
Your eye, too, will choose it instinctively for
its clean, trim lines —its suggestion of all-round
shooting ability.
The pleasing outline of the Remington-UMC
shot-gun or rifle is the result of an effort to secure
a safer arm* The protruding hammer, for one
thing, has been eliminated and the breech
completely closed*
We will be glad to send a booklet explaining simply
why these technical features are of vital importance to
you in your choice of an arm. Your name and address
on a post-card will bring it by return mail.

“From May to the end of October, 3912, I suffered
agonies with" acute MUSCULAR RHEUMATISM.
My ankles, knees and shoulder joints became
swollen and painful, and the excruciating pains in
my back were almost unbearable. I was in a
helpless condition, could scarcely stand; to make
matters worse, I completely lost my appetite, and to sleep at night was out of the
question.
“I had the best medical advice and medicines, Turkish and hot salt-water
baths out of number, also was massaged three times a week, but all to no purpose.
"I began to despair of ever being well again, and, as a last resource, concluded
to try CLEMENTS TONIC, I had read so much of it.
“I did so, and I FELT A WONDERFUL IMPROVEMENT. By the time
I had finished my second large bottle the swelling of the joints and pains in the
back left me. my appetite had returned, and I slept well. When I was on my
fourth bottle I felt as vigorous and strong as I ever did in my life.
“I can now go about and enjoy myself with renewed energy, that makes life
worth living. I have only Clements Tonic to thank for coming to my timely
assistance, when all other remedies failed to restore me to perfect health.

"How I Fooled the Beauty Doctors.
Removed »n Wrinkles Over Night"
After Plasters, Creams and Appliances, Steaming Pots,
Massage, Prescriptions, Apparatus, and all
Advertised flethods Had Absolutely Failed.
A Remarkable Interview with Mme. Lawton, who for the first time reveals to Sydney
“Bulletin” Readers Full Particulars of Her Recent Discovery.
Nothing Like It Was Ever Used or Ever Heard of Before.
By BLANCHE GORDON.
It has remained for a woman unskilled in
scientific research to solve, quite by acci-
dent, the problem that has baffled all science
and the entire medical profession the world
over. In a recent interview Mme. Lawton
explained to the writer why no one need
patronise expensive Beauty Specialists now,
for any woman can easily accomplish, in
the strict privacy of her own home, the
seeming miracles which are causing physi-
cians and beauty experts everywhere to
stand aghast in startled amazement.
smooth as a young child’s. Mme. Lawton
found a way to tighten the loose, sagging,
wrinkled skin, and to build up firm, healthy
tissue underneath where the wrinkles were,
so the skin rested on an even surface and
became virtually wrinkle-proof. Now, after
nearly two months, I saw with my own
eyes the face of smooth, delicate contour,
the beautiful, velvety skin and complexion
like a rose, where formerly were the deep
lines and furrows that added 20 years to her
age.
For the
first time
Madame
Lawton has
g e n e r ously
consented t o
reveal how
all the net-
work of lines
and furrows
left by ten
years of ill-
ness, worry
and care
were swept
from her face
in a single
night as
though b y
the wand of
some fabled
magician. She
explained to
me the embar-
rassment and
S3W3B®
Hi
m
.
vX
I :
To describe
the method
here in full
detail would
s o m e w h at
overrun the
space allotted
to me for
this article,
but Mm e.
Lawton e x-
plained that a
perfect deluge
o f requests
for informa-
tion has de-
scended upon
her, and many
of the in-
quiries are
from her
acquaintances,
but to person-
all.y write
a satisfactory
humiliation she felt when her face became
seared and seamed by myriads of disfiguring
wrinkles, how deep creases appeared where
once the dimples were, and how she, though
still young, had the heartrending experience
of being looked upon with pity, as a pre-
maturely old woman totally devoid of all
personal attractiveness. For, after all, the
world judges a woman’s age by her appear-
ance, and if her face remains youthful, the
mere’ passing of years means nothing to her.
But if her face proclaims her old, a pitiless
world sees only the disfiguring marks of
time and approaching old age. so bids her
step aside for a younger generation.
Mme. Lawton described with deep feeling
the sadness with which she thus viewed the
passing of her own youth, and said it was
the most bitterly tragic period of her whole
life She was able to afford any expense,
so could command the services of the best
specialists in the land, and she frantically
tried massage, which stretched the skin still
more electrical treatments that were tor-
ture, ’ medicines that made her ill, suction
cups’, masks, irritating lotions, and worth-
less advertised methods galore. After wast-
ing a fortune in this way. however, she was
compelled to give up in absolute despair.
Imagine, then, her ecstasies of joy and
delight, the indescribable relief that filled
her soul to overflowing when quite by acci-
dent she one day discovered an almost in-
credibly simple process, involving a totally
new scientific principle, which quickly ban-
ished every trace of line or wrinkle from
her face. " Light lines and crowsfeet dis-
appeared within an hour, in a single night,
fl->e deepest creases were gone, and in less
than a week her face was soft, clear and
answer to everyone would be quite impos-
sible, so she hit upon the clever plan of fully
describing her method in a small booklet.
A limited number of these, the first to be
printed, had just arrived, and after much
persuasion I was fortunately able to arrange
with Mme. Lawton to send one of these
attractive booklets, while they last, abso-
lutely free of cost, to any of our readers
sufficiently interested to write her and en-
close two penny stamps for posting expenses.
Mme. Lawton refused to accept the
slightest payment for her trouble, saying
she has explained the method to many of
her friends, from whom she showed me
letters proving they had all used it with
wonderful success; and as it now appears
to be practically infallible, she welcomes
this opportunity to show her gratitude by
giving the secret to our readers. Simply
address Mme. Lawton (554 A), 197 Regent
Street, London, W., Eng., and I advise
writing promptly, as the supply of booklets
is limited, and the offer expires in 60 days
owing to the amount of trouble and work
involved. Nevertheless, I consider it very
kind and generous of her to subject herself
to the inconvenience even for a short period,
especially when we consider that she makes
no charge whatever for the booklet.
The supply is estimated to last 60 days,
but if you are delayed in writing and no
booklets remain when your letter arrives
the postage will be returned to you. This
arrangement has been made for the special
benefit of Sydney Bulletin readers only,
and this article should be torn out and en-
closed in your letter as evidence that you
are entitled to receive the valuable informa-
tion.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

up the human race, and many of them are
disasters. Two of the disasters are the per-
son who won’t keep still at the right mo-
ment, and the person who will touch the paint
to see if it is dry—which it seldom is, for
that kind of person wouldn’t be the kind of
person- lie is if he didn’t touch the paint
when it was wet. As a case in point, there
lias been a heap of clamor lately about the
High C ost of Living, especially in the matter
of food, and more particularly in the matter
of locally-produced food. The High Cost of
Living has been talked at, and talked about,
as if it were a thief or a pirate that had
boiled its grandmother. It has been slan-
dered in the press. Potts and Slurk have
quarrelled about it in their rival organs, and
Potts has declared that Slurk’s policy is
the cause of all the trouble, while Slurk
has retaliated, and alleged that Potts has
all the natural and humpbacked instincts of
a nyena. uodli n ana (short nave breatnea

on the subject; ana eacn nas uectareu coat,
it be got cue job ana toe pay tor a sumci-
entiy long penoa, ne wouiu bring down the
High L'nce or a ood. Politicians like Wade
anu Holman ana Fisher ana Cook nave
barked on the subject. Fisher accuses
LOOK of lailure to take steps to reduce the
Dost or Diving. Oook ana ins rriends make
a areaatui Horse like a rriea egg in the dis-
tance to the effect that tne riStiER tariff
has done tne evil Deed. Wade says nothing
or importance, but wears a shocked expres-
sion. Holman declares that tnough wages
nave gone up, tne’price or food, etc., nas
risen so enormously that “the worker” is
worse off than lie was before. Winch is a
curiously imbecile or ignorant or unscrupu-
lous thing for even Holman to say, seeing
that “the workers’ ” savings, as shown by
«he savings bank deposits, have doubled since
1908. In other words, the man of small
means—the man who mostly uses the savings
bank and puts his surplus earnings there —
has been able to stow away as much, over
and above the cost of living, during 10 years
of high prices, as he was able to put away in
all the previous history of Australia. Fur-
thermore, the proportion of people who have
surplus wealth to put away has increased,
during 10 years of comparatively high
prices, from 272 per 1000 inhabitants to
nearly 400. That shows a more general
diffusion of wealth and a better outlook.
It may be that Providence has become
angry at the foois who dian t know wnen It
haa been good to them. It may be that the
tools touened tne paint too otten to ascer-
tain whether it was dry, and wore the paint
oit. Anyhow, food prices are going down.
Among tne things that are cheaper than they
were a year ago are wheat, hour, butter,
eggs, cheese, lard, oatmeal, mutton, beef,
potatoes, onions, peas and some sundries—
almost all of them being articles of which
Australia has a big surplus for export. The
result is what any reasonable person might
have expected. Australia, in 1911, raised
211,00U,D001b. of butter, of which nearly
half (about 102,000,0001 b.) were available
for export. If the price rose from Sd. to Is.
per lb., the pound of butter which Smith,
the local farmer, sold to Jones, the local
artisan, would cost 4d. more. But the money
would remain in the country, and whether
the extra 4d: belonged to Smith or Jones
would make no difference in the aggregate
wealth and possibilities of the country.
Jones could always get his share back by
demanding increased wages. But when the
price went up from Bd. to Is. the pound of
butter that was exported would bring 4d.
more into the country, and the 102,000,0001 b.
that were annually exported would bring
£1,700,000 more into the country, for the
immediate enrichment of Smith and the
ultimate profit of Jones. On the other
hand, if butter went down from Is. to 4d.
per lb., to the great joy of the people who
clamor for cheap food and demand a reduc-
tion in the good old Cost of Living, the coun-
try would receive £3,400,000 per annum less
than it did before. So Smith, the butter-
producer, would Mart to economise hard, and
would give Jones, the artisan, less work at
poorer wages. And it would be a just retri-
bution on both parties for their failure to
recognise a great advantage when they met
it.
The clamor for Cheap Food, which is the
chief element in the demand for a reduction
in the Cost of Living, is a purely English
idea. To men like Cook and Holman and
Hughes, who take their fiscal ideas ready-
made from the Bull country, the fact that
the cheap-food superstition is English is
sufficient. And even Andrew Fisher, who
stands in most respects on a higher political
plane, drifts into the Cheap Food camp.
The whole difference depends on the circum-
stances of the case. A country like Eng-
land, which has to buy most of the provi-
sions it eats, wants to buy cheap.
It wants low prices. A country like
Australia, with a vast surplus of
provisions for sale, wants to sell dear. It
wants high prices. If Australian butter
went down to 2d. per lb., there would be an
immense gain to England, but though the
fall would make for cheaD living in Aus-
tralia, it would be ruinous to Australia. If
the same article went, up to ss. per lb., it
would be a huge, gain to Australia despite
the increased local cost of living. Whether
at 2d. or at 55., the local butter which the
local inhabitant used, would represent, so far
as the aggregate community was concerned,
money taken out of one pocket and put into
another. But with a low cost of living and
butter at 2d. per lb., there would be, at the
present export rate, less than £1.000.000 per
annum coming into the country in return for
exported cow-fat. With the same article at
ss. there would be over £25 000,000 coming
in. That difference of more than £24 GOO.OOO
would make a most remarkable difference
between wealth and beggary. A country
with an immense surnlus of butter for sale
can afford to throw lib. of the article to the
dog when the nrice is ss. and the cost of
living is high, while it is glad to get mar-
garine to eat when the price is 2d. and the
cost of living is almost nothing. The simnle
proposition is that the seller (Australia)
prospers when prices are big. and the buyer
(England) nrospers when they are small.
Unfortunately quite a number of stereo-
typed copyists, like Cook and Holman,
assume that everything which applies to
English conditions must anply to Aus-
tralian conditions also. Hence the clamor
for depreciated victuals. It would be just
as reasonable for a man with a wild cat to
sell to clamor for depreciated shares.
As already mentioned, the prices of most
articles of food are now on the down grade.
It may be that Providence shoved them
down because It was angered by the Aus-
tralian fiscal theorists who didn’t appreciate
the blessedness of the High Cost of Living.
So the time of cheaper existence is in sight
—that is to say, the influx of money in
payment for Australia’s surplus products is
diminishing. And with cheaper existence
comes the cry about depression, the howl
regarding lack of work, the unemployed de-
putation to the Premier, and all the
other, old symptoms. Within the memory
of this generation of Australians, the time
when living was least r mensive was about
1893 and 1894, During that lamentable
experience, locally-grown food could be
bought for very little, and the rent of a sub-
urban cottage was almost nothing, paid irre-
gularly. Yet it wasn’t a good experience-
in fact, it was an utter misery. It ought to
have been a glorious epoch, according to the
folk who regard cheap victuals as the chief
end of man. but something went wrong.
Now something threatens to go wrong again,
and the slump in victuals is evidence
thereof.
WANTED: A PARLIAMENTARY RE-
FORM COMMITTEE.
“10-2-4” indulges in a Vision :
If there is any one subject on which all hands,
Liberal, Labor, Socialist and Anarchist are in hearty
agreement, it is that the present breed of Parlia-
mentarians, more especially in the State Houses, is
hopelessly degenerate. The tap-room badinage which
passes for wit ; the childish displays of temper ; the
punehings and kick mgs and violent ejections; and
the cursing and blasphemy which accompany the
same—practices which appear to be chronic in the
N. S. Wales Assembly these days, and which are
more or less general elsewhere—are beginning to
disgust the electors with the whole Parliamentary
system. The dark hour looms when citizens with
M.L.A. attached to their names will be refused
admittance to respectable hotels, theatres, and so on,
just as in F.ngland private soldiers in uniform are
barred from many of the resorts of civilians. If
anything were needed to complete and round off the
scandalised exasperation with which the intelligent
voter regards tile aiuics of his chosen legislators, it
would be provided in the working of the Party Gov-
ernment system. Seventy-five per cent, of Aus-
tralians are sick of Party Government. Even those
Conservative newspapers which have stood by it most
staunchly in the past are beginning to waver. “The
ingenuity of man has yet to devise a better,” is their
customary summing-up of the situation—a sort of
admission by implication which is grimly significant
considering its source. The reasons why Australia’s
multitudinous legislators are mostly men of poor
intellectual calibre are various, but one stands out
conspicuously. The party selection system, which is
the direct and inevitable outcome of the party
government system, ensures, in about 95 per cent,
of cases, that the more nationally undesirable a can-
didate is the better chance he will have of getting
into Parliament. There appear, for instance, to be
as many fine and unsavory points about getting the
selection . for a likely N. S. Wales seat as
there are in the business of stiffening a favorite at
a pony meeting. The League membership rolls have
to be stuffed with bribed supporters at so much per
head ; hair-raising lies require to be circulated about
the enemy’s habits, immoralities and lack of religious
belief; Orangemen have to be stirred up against
the opposition, on the one hand, and Roman Catho-
lics on the other. By the time the selection is actu-
ally made, the whole of the candidates stand out
before the constituency which they are after, as a
collection of canting hypocrites and bloody-minded
desperadoes. In the nature of things, the one who
is really the most villainous—he who has packed his
League most assiduously, and lied and slandered hard-
est —stands the best chance of winning the selec-
tion and the seat. It is not strange in the circum-
stances that the better sort of citizen is beginning
to regard the request that he shall go into State
politics as tantamount almost to a suggestion that
he should take to thieving or burglary or some such
reputation-blasting avocation.
* * * *
The class of man that is needed to redeem State poli-
tics does not exactly teem in any community. He must
be sober, take him for all in all. At any rate, he
should be relied on not to be blind drunk within
the precincts of the House more than (say) once a
fortnight. He must have sufficient control over his
temper not to smite people on the jaw and else-
where, by way of response to their criticisms of his
political methods. He should possess some know-
ledge of business and of life. Above everything, he
should be above the necessity of mouthing the banal
old party gags from the moment he enters the
House; and he should not follow the decision of
the Caucus vote when it runs contrary to his convic-
tions. If, in addition to the rare qualities of moder-
ate sobriety, comparatively decent habits and inde-
pendence, a representative could be got who had
ideas and imagination, and a certain amount of criti-
cal ability, the country would benefit considerably.
And if half a dozen, or, better still, a dozen, such
could be got, the country would benefit to a tre-
mendous extent.
* * * *
According to' this writer’s way of looking at things,
the likeliest means of getting the desirable type of
representative above-mentioned is by proceeding
along something the lines that Australia’s de-
fence enthusiasts did when the necessity of forcing
on that movement first came to be realised. There
is a fairly close analogy between the two situations.
Australia’s lack of defence was a prominent scandal
half a dozen years ago, just as its disreputable Par-
liaments are a scandal to-day. Everyone was inter-
ested not a«ly from patriotic, but from financial,
reasons, in getting the defence of this continent on
a sound basis. The same people are interested for
the same reasons, in getting the Government of the
different States on a sane and decent footing. And
so on. The Defenceites formed a committee of re-
putable public men, of all shades of politics, whose
aim was to do whatever was considered best for the
cause. A similar committee, if it put its back into
the job, might in a very few years make all the
difference to, for example, the N. S. Wales Assembly.
It would require, of course, to be representative of
all classes. It would need to be composed of men
who carried public confidence. Whether a member
happened to be a Freetrader or a Protectionist, a
State Righter or a Unificationist, a Hibernian, a
violent Derryite. or a confirmed Pagan, would, for
reasons that will appear later, be immaterial. Each
man would have to be above the suspicion of self-
seeking or party bias. The duty of the committee
would be, in a sense, educative, as was the case with
the committee of Defence. But the committee which
js here pronosed wo'dd begin where the Defenc"
Committee left off. No one requires at this time of
uay to nave uenn-.istrateu i,u mm uiai a ueicei iy_oc
of Parliamentarian is essential to the welfare of the
country ; whereas thousands had to have their minds
disabused, a few years back, of the fallacy that a
mercenary fleet and volunteer soldiers were the best
safeguards a country could depend on. The business
of the Parliamentary Reform Commit/°e, as it might
be called, would be to endo--' with its approval the
best Parliamentary candidate which offered, irre-
spective of the party which they belonged to. Under
the existing demented system, if the most illiterate,
brainless and inebriated Liberal or Laborite stood
for a seat under the segis of his party nomination, he
would be a certainty to beat an independent of the
type of G. S. Bf.eby or B. R. Wise. If David Fell
broke with his party on some point of principle to-
morrow, he would be ousted from his present safe
seat by the first docile narty hack that came along ;
and if Holman suddenlv became an anti-borrower,
or in some other respect violated the prejudices of
his colleagues, Cootamundra would not know him
after next elections. This grotesque embargo upon
honesty—admittedly one of the necessary evils of the
Party Government system—might be lifted to a great
extent if the suggestion which is here made were
carried out conscientiously. It goes without saying
that the endorsements of the committee would have
to be palpably honest and devoid of bias. So much
as one glaringly absurd selection would discredit the
body for life. Its existence, as well as its useful-
ness, would depend entirelv on the judicial q....ucy
of its collective mind. Half a dozen satisfactory
combinations of citizens could be suggested. Here
is one that occurs off-hand to the writer: —
Professor MacCallum, J. C. Watson, Adrian
Knox, K.C., G. S. Beeby, Professor David, Ernest
Lamb, K.C., W. A. Holman, Mark Sheldon,
Richard Binnie, John Meagher, M.L.C.
All the above are men of proved capacity in their
various lines.' The public respects them, alike in the
matter of brains, judgment and character. Their recom-
mendation would make all the difference to a candi-
date. And if, as is likely, they selected habitually
(where thev considered it worth their while to select
at all) the best available man, their recommendations
would very soon make all the difference to Parlia
ment.
1 lie fact that about 75 per cent, of Australians
are utterly sick of Party Government has already
been mentioned. The trouble is it is a difficult in-
cubus to shift; and the Conservative daily press
while dimly suspicious that the ancient fetich is
doomed, will do nothing to hasten its gradual end
The return to Parliament of a number of men who
had been recommended to the electors on non-partv
lines, and who could be sure that they would con-
tinue to be so recommended provided they conducted
themselves capably and well, would probably deal
a shrewder blow at a system that has outlived its
usefulness than any other that could be
imagined. For the first time since Responsible Gov-
ernment made its appearance in these parts men
would be able to get up and say exactly what they
thought on all questions. Also they would be able
to vote exactly as they thought. The childish prac-
tice of assailing the other side’s measure, not on its
merits, but merely because it happens to be the pro-
perty of the other side, would fall into abevance
As many political truths would be heard in the
Assembly in a week as are now voiced there in a
year. The more imbecile and disreputable repre-
sentatives would be gradually eliminated; and in
place of legislators whose chief merit consisted in
being either Trades Hall fanatics on the one hand
or Conservative fanatics on the other, the country
would get intelligent and decently behaved M’s.P.
men of much the same calibre as one finds associated
with the running of big business concerns, stations,
banks and so on. Anyone who is inclined to dispute
that this would be a change vastly for the better i=
hereby urged to endure a couple of hours in the
N.S.W. Assembly any night that the House is sitting.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
An III-Chosen Complaint.
A certain streak of humor was added to
the lack-of-confidence motion propounded by
ex-Prime Minister Fisher, inasmuch as he
charged present Prime Minister Cook with
having tailed “to realise the urgent neces-
sity of an immediate revision of the tariff. ’
Certainly Crime Minister Cook is a joke,
because his party in the Senate is so small
that it has to be searched for with a blood-
hound and a microscope; while in the
iiepresentatives his majority is just one,
and when allowance is made for the Speaker
it is just none, and when a discount
is taken off for the chronic and incurable
absence of Bruce Smith the Prime Min-
ister is practically certain to be in a
minority in the Heps. also. A vote of cen-
sure might be reasonably moved against
the Cook conglomeration on the ground
that it is a shriek, and an object of mirth,
and an unintentional contribution to the
gaiety of nations, for a Prime Minister with
a hopeless prospect in one House and no
prospect worth mentioning in the other can
hardly be taken seriously. He should simply
be charged with not amounting to a row of
pins, and accused of being small potatoes
and hardly any of them in a hill. But
there is something strangely unwise in
charging Cook, the alleged Freetrader, with
failure to rush headlong at a revision of
the tariff. The Fisher Ministry, headed by
an alleged Protectionist, was in power for
three years, and it didn’t revise the tariff
worth a cent. During its term of office the
imports boomed on an unprecedented scale,
and there being no corresponding increase
in the exports, the country began visibly to
go to perdition. The continuous rise of
Australian wages made the old tariff quite
hopeless as a defence. It had been fairly
good in its day, but a tariff which may just
enable the goods made by a 40s. workman
here to hold their own against those of a
20s. workman elsewhere is of no value when
it is a case of enabling the output of a 60s.
workman inside Australia to hold its own
against the competition of a 21s. workman
outside. The floating of foreign loans in
order to get money to pay for the cheap-
labor and nigger-labor and often “scab”-
labor goods which were pouring into the
country to deprive the Australian worker
of his job became a scandal. The diminu-
tion of the local gold reserves, because
money was rushing out to pay for the cheap-
labor goods which climbed in over the
absurdly-low tariff wall, became a cause for
general alarm. It began to look almost as
if the great breakdown of 1893 might be
repeated—on a smaller scale, but still on a
scale that would be big enough to
make stupendous trouble. Latterly the
unemployed began to clamor, for while the
local 405.-a-week man could hold his own,
with the aid of a small tariff, against the
205.-a-week man in England, the local 605.-
a-week man was in a very different posi-
tion. But despite the urgency of the case
the Fisher Government did nothing. It
was the legitimate heir of that N.S.W. Labor
party which “sunk the fiscal issue.” It
professed fiscal atheism. It was dominated
throughout by W. M. Hughes, who is about
the most incurable advocate of the foreign
importer’s interests in the Commonwealth,
and who depends for his political existence
on the votes of the wharf-laboring class —
that class which lives by handling the cheap-
labor goods which are brought in here to
prevent the Australian artisan getting a
job. Towards the end of its term of office
the Fisher Government made some pre-
tence of saving its face by threatening to
revise the tariff, but desnite its solid
majority it never moved. All its political
life it stuck to the interests of the Tory
middleman. And when it was decided to
establish the long-postponed inter-State
Commission, which, among other things, is
to advise on tariff problems, it offered the
presidency to the W. M. Hughes above-
mentioned—about the most aggressive Free-
trader in these parts. Cook has certainly
done no more about the tariff than Fisher
did. but Cook has only been nominally in
power for a few weeks, while Fisher was
aetuallv in power for a few years. And
Cook has at least achieved this much: He
has appointed an inter-State Commission
to report on tlm tariff, and though the Pre-
sident is something in the way of a Free-
trader the other two members —the two
sirong men of the institution—are strenuous
Protectionists. ' Therefore it is fairly safe
to assume that the recommendations of the
Commission will be in the direction of sup-
porting Australian industrv. finding employ-
ment for well-paid Australian artisans, and
discouraging the inrush of low-wage imports.
.And it is fairly reasonable to conclude that
Cook. the alleged Freetrader with the con-
venient conscience, doesn’t propose to im-
peril his job by holding nn the importers
cause as Hughes did. In these circum-
stances the ground of objection winch
taken against Cook seems sin-
gularly ill-selected.

The City Alderman Beautiful.
This paper isn’t great on pomp and show
nor does it out much faith in l’arlmmentary
maces Speakers’ wigs, the robes and pet i-
coats of kings, or the spectacle of a barrister
wearing on his head the extremitv or fly.
whisk or bee-dislodger of the horse Still
in its own humble sixpenny wav it’ rovrlt
that the Sydney City Council ‘should have
recently turned down the proposal that
someone should devise a special uniform or
State costume for aldermen. The idea opens
up possibilities. There would, of course
be buckled shoes, and above them would be
silk stockings the color of a town hall. Bows
of ribbon would decorate the knees of the
city fathers on general principles. The
aldermanic breeches would be of velvet-
blue, green red or other colors according to
the period during which the alderman had
held office. Ex-Mayors would have one leg
of the costume red and the other blue. Mayors
would be striped, and mayors in their sec-
ond term would have a stupendous “2” on
the back of the tunic. Mavors in their
third term would wear the figure “3 ” The
tunic or doublet ought to he white to show
the moral purity of the wearer, and his utter
refusal to take a tip from the contractor
for garbage removal. On his head would
gleam a cocked hat with an eagle’s feather
The eagle being a fowl of lofty flight its
feather would suggest how high the wearer
was prepared to pile the municipal debt
also the loftiness of his principles. He
would carry on his shoulder a pick, shovel
and broom, as emblems of his devotion to
municipal undertakings. A train would
hang from the small of his back, whore
his kidneys are. On it would be embroi-
dered curses to suggest his capacity in muni-
cipal debate, also a picture of a slum to
call attention to the need for local improve-
ment. Behind the alderr-nn, on great occa-
sions, three men would run—a Jew. a bail-
iff and an incurable idiot. The .Tew would
suggest tlie money that has been borrowed;
the bailiff would be a reminder of what will
happen if the money isn’t repaid ; and the
incurable idiot would tynify public opinion
as regards the original construction of the
city— that tangled construction which has
involved so much expensive repair and re-
construction in later times. A devil might
be painted somewhere on the aldermanic
robes to hint that affairs are in a Sheol of a
mess, and a large rent in the back of the
costume might call attention to the tin-
bridged gap between Sydney and North
Sydney. The writer can’t think of any-
thing else at the moment, except that the
city father might carry a crust in his hand
as. an emblem of poverty, the income not
being equal to the expenditure; and drag
an empty water-can behind him at the end
of a long string by way of a side allusion to
the dust trouble.
The Amateur and the Professional.
P. J. O’Regan, of Maoriland, ex-M.H.R.,
lawyer and anti-compulsory-defence advo-
cate, said, while addressing a public meet-
ing the other day :
If I thought that military training was necessary
I would be the first to support it.
He argued that it wasn't necessary,, and, of
course, he was quite right. It isn t neces-
sary, even, to have a trained lawyer to de-
fend a citizen’s life or liberty; but it the
man in the dock employed a horsebreaker
or a butter merchant to do the job, his
liberty would be forfeited just as quickly as
the door of a lunatic asylum could be
slammed on him. Nor is it at all necessary
to have a trained medical party when small-
pox or plague attacks the community. A
day of fasting might be ordered ; or specia
prayers offered at the corner chapel; or
clods hurled at the intruder; but it would
be a somewhat unusual proceeding, and not
likely to raise a howl of applause even from
people like O’Regan. D . im * g J he -, g ™ a «

Sydney “Telegraph” Sees More Blood.
This is how the Sydney Telegraph let
( 15 /8/’l3), when it learned that the
hood Supply Commission had recommended
Municipal Markets: —
R ? s . difficult to imagine why the Government
should have been kept waiting so long for its “tip,”
Which is simply to the effect that Socialised market-
ing is a crying necessity. The gist of it all is that
the City Council, or some other authority, should
take over the whole business of food marketing in
the metropolitan area where no competing markets
should be allowed. This sweeping proposal for the
restraint of trade would take away from every
producer of foodstuffs the right of selling them to
what he considered the best advantage How a
monopoly of the kind suggested would be able to
do the work of distribution more efficiently or econ-
omically is left carefully unexplained. Etc., etc.
The unthinking citizen who happened to be
ill versed in the history of municipalism
might well imagine, from a study of the
above, that some madly perilous experiment
was about to be made. The thought would
strike him, probably, that the Socialistic
Tiger had, atter years of delay, arrived at
last and started ravening. In fancy he
would see his prosperity going; capital
fleeing from the country; his State a laugh-
ing stock among the sane nations of the
other parts of the world ; and chaos immi-
nent. As a result, he might be relied on to
pledge himself vigorously, in the nearest
bar, or what not, to do all that a law-abid-
ing man might to destroy the politicians who
were putting shame and ruin upon him. The
knowledgeable citizen—a much rarer bird,
unfortunately—would, on the other hand,
immediately dismiss the Telegraph’s out-
burst for the arrant tripe it is. What the
Telegraph, in its reactionary fury, terms
“a sweeping proposal for the restraint of
trade,” is such a common and admittedly
beneficial feature of the landscape in the
United Kingdom and in many parts of
Europe that it has ceased to attract the
attention of the rabidest of Tories. Glas-
gow Anti-Socialists, for example, would no
more think of railing against municipal
markets, at this time of day, than Sydney
Anti-Socialists would consider the idea of
starting a campaign against N.S.W.’s So-
cialistic gaols, trams, asylums and trains.
As long ago as 1888 a Royal Commission
was appointed in England to inquire into
the question of whether or no markets should
be run by the local authorities. There was
not one Socialist on the Commission. In
fact, in those days, a Socialist was accus-
tomed to find it hard work to get on to the
side-walk, so to speak, much less on to a
reputable Royal Commission. The Earl of
Derby, Lord Balfour of Burleigh, Justin
lluntly McCarthy and the Mayors of Bir-
mingham and Manchester were among the
members. This Commission unanimously
recommended that the local authorities in
every centre should control and run the
markets; and five out of the 12 members
went further, and recorded their view that
all the markets should be resumed compul-
sorily by the municipalities the. spot.
Knoop, who is anything but a Socialist, in
his new book, “Municipal Trading”—a stan-
dard work in its line —makes a precisely
similar recommendation. The fact is, the
N S W. Royal Commission’s suggestion m
regard to the markets, which has so scan-
dalised local Liberalism, represents about
the mildest form of collective action imagin-
able. The suggested change is not a novelty
even as regards Australia. Melbourne has
flourished under “Socialised markets” for
years, and it would not revert to the archaic
Sydney arrangement for a fortune. Nearly
ail the big provincial cities and towns m
Britain have had municipal markets for de-
cades. They have long come to recognise
that, on the grounds of sanitation alone
(proper inspection of the goods offered is
easy where there is one central depot, and
evasion is practically impossible), the So-
cialistic market” is worth while. I he fact
that such an institution performs the work
of distributing more efficiently and economi-
cally does not need to be explained care-
fullv” or otherwise. The point has been
proved conclusively and often in a thousand
different centres.

known as the McGowen-Holman Govern-
ment took office, the amount paid over in
connection with these boards has leaped
from nearly 16000' a year to nearly £16,000.
In 1910-11 (nine months) fees paid to mem-
bers of the boards totalled £1347 ; to chair-
men, £3195. In 1911-12 the fees to mem-
£239l; to chairmen,
£o<o9. In 1912-13 the fees soared to £5759
for members, and £i24o for chairmen.
Travelling and other costs moved in ratio.
Meanwhile, a Special Commission is strug-
gling, regardless of expense, to find out how

Justice Powers on Trusts.
S. M. Herald is something extra special in
the way of asses when it lays its ears back
to the job, or else it thinks the public is. On
Saturday it worked out with great care
and a splash of large letters a summary of
Justice Powers’ report to W. M. Hughes
when Federal Attorney-General regarding
trusts and combines. This is how Granny
introduced the views of the commissioner:—
NO COMBINES.
MR. JUSTICE POWERS’ REPORT.
LABOR CHARGES DISPROVED.
Having made it appear that Powers’ deci-
sion was that there are no combines in
Australia the Tory sheet proceeded to print
over half a column of the report, including
these references:—
The Metropolitan Brick Company, Ltd., of Sydney,
it was alleged, had combined to prevent manufac-
turers and patentees of artificial stones and contrac-
tors from obtaining the necessary bricks
for portions of a building partly built of
artificial stone except at prohibitive rates. In con-
nection with this case Mr. Powers was of opinion
that there was a combination in restraint of trade,
but it could be successfully prosecuted, etc.
Regarding, the Tobacco combine, Mr.
Powers stated: “I am of opinion that al-
though undoubtedly a combination of
industries and companies it is not a combi-
nation contrary to the Act of 1896.
Mr. Powers’ report upon allegations in
connection with an alleged trust in the con-
fectionery trade states :
The example given was the case of almond rock,
that Could be purchased until recently from Sydney
in Victoria at 7d. per pound, and which was re-
tailed at Is. per pound. The Melbourne manufac-
turers’ price was 9d., and since the alleged under-
standing, Sydney manufacturers refused to sell to the
Victorian manufacturers under 9d. Retailers could
not, therefore, sell the goods bought at 9d. under
Is. 4d.
Mr. Powers stated that, until the High Court’s
interpretation of “with intent to the detriment of
trade” was obtained, it was imposible to say whether
any prosecution would succeed. “The only question,”
he said, “1 would respectfully submit is whether
the first ... .case should not be that of the coal com-
bine, which unfairly increases the price of coal to the
people of all the States and of New South Wales.”
Regarding an alleged combination of wheat traders
in South Australia, Mr. Powers ' recommended , that
a meeting of State attorneys be held for the purpose
of combined action in legislating for such matters,
this being outside the jurisdiction of the Common-
wealth.
Maybe there are no combinations in Aus-
tralia, just as there may be no trusts or
commercial corporations or “honorable un-
derstandings,” but to plank the statement
above the report of Mr. Powers
another way of calling him an auctioneer.
“W.F.”: “Hermes” (B. 10/7/T3) is quite
right in his reference to the Defence Acts
of Australia and Maoriland. If the anti-
training humbugs are to be properly dealt
with, amendments are imperative. In M.L.
the Government seems powerless to deal
with a few louts who are sooled into insub-
ordination by the Quakers, the Peace
Society, and the Federation of Labor. They
openly defy the law, refuse to attend
parades, and, when arrested, pose as
martyrs. Christchurch is the head-
quarters of these braves. When they are
ordered military detention it is undergone
on Ripa Island. Here, although they
mostly refuse to work, they are permitted
to hang out in a free and easy style. They
are well cared for, supplied with ample food
of good quality, and lead the lazy, loafing
existence that suits them. Then, at the
end of their term, they are released to tell
their stories to the copy-hunting reporter.
Premier Massey has set up a Parliamentary
committee to consider what is to be done.
Perhaps, as a start, it might be worth while
trving the anti-defence people’s logic on
themselves. If it isn’t good enough for
them to help protect the country, it ought
to be good enough for the country to refuse
to help protect them individually. Thus,
the policeman would stand by and look on
cheerfullv while the burglar sandbagged
them and departed with their goods. The
fire brigade would merely go round
the corner for a drink when their homes
were blazing. When the insurance co.
declined to pay up its liabilities on the
destruction of the said homes, the
Courts, on being appealed to. would gaze
coldly on the applicants and tell them to get
work. There are quite a lot _of in-
teresting possibilities in this anti-defence
scheme if it is given the quid pro quo it
deserves.
■*- 1 —
“Quidam’s” reflections: —
Why this melancholy belief on the part of the
Tory person and the Tory press, particularly evi-
dent before an election, that if anything is done
differently everything will disintegrate, and the
world will resolve itself into a dishevelled ruin
blowing about space? In my own experience I
remember hearing the same dismal prophecies about
payment of members, one man one vote, abolition of ,
coiored labor in Australia, universal education,
Labor politics, old age pensions and several dozen
more trifles in full swing at present. Yet the world
keeps on going round, and there is eating and drink-
ing and toiling and merrymaking, and buying and
selling and giving in marriage, and joy and sorrow,
and sunshine and shadow, just as of yore, and the
world even seems to be a slightly better place for
the ordinary man than it used tb be. Looking at
things bv and large, there are several hundred
systems of morals and governments, and methods
of making boats, and battleships, and pens and
perambulators, and electoral laws and so on. Yet
each and all of these things, must have once been
invented, or discovered, or hatched, or otherwise
evolvedand no doubt the Tory of the blissful
period when they didn’t exist howled and danced on
his hat and shrieked that everything would go to
blazes if mankind adopted revolutionary innovations,
just as he does now and as he will probably be
doing 2000 years hence. Ever since the far-distant
epocn wfien an inquiring ana progressive cave-
uweller discovered mat ne could smue his enemy
or his missus harder with a wooden club than with
his fist, mankind has kept discovering some new
way of doing some old tning that grandpa knew
nothing about, and the contemporary i ory has con-
tinually howled about ruin and desolation and
smash. Even in the matter ot trouser buttons,
modern man wears them where dear old great-
grandpa didn’t; and in spite of the prediction of
dear old great-grandpa that a posterity which didn’t
button its trousers up the sides must be indecent
and immoral and calculated to bring the blusn of
shame to the cheek of the Young Person, the sinful
fashion prevails to-day in the best Tory circles. All
of which appears to point to the fact tnat this world
isn’t in such a sensitive state of equilibrium that
if we alter one law, custom, usage, privilege or
system it will instantly overbalance and go hurtling
away into space, and the habit of thinking it is
such a world isn’t one that should be encouraged.
The N.S.W. Government proposes to estab-
lish a Fair Kent Court, to which occupiers
ot houses rented at dOs. a weed or less may
apply for a reduction. It being a purely
class measure anybody who pays 3Us. 6d. a
week or more may whistle for relief. if a
workman and his married son like to share
a house—the old lady being a kindly person
who can get on with her daughter-in-law,
and the son’s wife being a sociable girl who
hasn’t got the mother-in-law superstition—
they will probably pay 355. a week among
them, and will get no relief from a rack-
renting landlord. Or if they are sinlply
people who like comfort and elbow-room,
and are willing to strain their resources so
that the children may have a sleeping com-
partment apiece, then also they will get no
relief. On the other hand, if the family is
sour and cantankerous, and everybody
wants to live apart, or if it is frankly
brutal, and doesn’t mind shoving three girls
and two boys into one bedroom —Well, in
these circustances it will probably occupy
a one-pound-a-week establishment, and the
new law will take care of it and give it
all possible assistance. The tendency is to
make it advisable to live meanly in mean
streets, for if you live meanly in a mean
street the statute will look after you, and
if you live in a fairly decent fashion it won’t.
The new measure is avowedly inspired by
the growth of rents in Sydney, for in the
decaying country towns of N.S.W. there is
no upward movement. In many towns
there is a downward movement. It is a
strange idea that in a State with less than
six people to the square mile there should
be one vastly congested blot where the pres-
sure of inhabitants and rent makes a Fair
Rent law necessary, or even excusable, but
muddled N.S.W. has got to that point.
A typical anti-immigration argument was
advanced in the Vic. Assembly by Labor
member Solly. “England is going down
as an agricultural nation, and it is impos-
sible to expect to get farmers or farm lab-
orers from there,” said Solly. Now, if
England were going up as an agricultural
nation farmers and farm laborers would be
less likely to leave it. But Solly does at
least make a pretence of confining his ob-
jection to the English brand of immigrant,
whereas brother Hannah candidly protests
against the policy of importing any breed
of laborers for population’s sake. Asked
whether “a sparsely-populated White Aus-
tralia could maintain the land by force of
arms?” he answered. “Yes. easily. Don’t
we form part of the British Empire.” The
dragging of the poor old British Lion into
anti-immigration argument is a new idea.

Bananaland is showing the bad results of
the southern example, and seems to be
struggling to turn itself into a one-city
State. The areas of the three divisions
are —South, 210,736 sq. miles; Central,
209,340; North. 250,424. _ _ Yet of the rail-
ways under construction 56 per cent, of the
mileage is in the South, though the South’s
area is only 31 per cent, of the lot, while
in the Central division the mileage is 11 per
cent., though the area is as much as 31 per
cent., and the North, with 37 per cent, of the
area, has only 33 per cent, of the new lines.
It is little discrepancies like this that make
all Queensland outside the South look on
Unification as the thing most needful, be-
cause the thing most likely to bring about
redistribution of the present stupidly-
arranged States.
♦
From a man in the business: —
If the Australian Parliament should consider the
tariff question during the coming session, those of
us who are engaged in the olive industry trust that
something will he done to put a duty on bulk oil.
Australian olive oil, perhaps from the nature of the
soil, or perhaps because the first growers in South
Aus. imported only specially fine varieties of olives,
ranks with the world’s best, and received the gold
medal at the Franco-British Exhibition in London
four years ago. The quality is so good that, though
the cost of manufacture is high, Australian labor
having to compete with the Italian afticle at two
francs a day and with the Syrian goods at even less,
a small export trade has grown up, chiefly with
Maoriland.
As the Australian product is better than anything
yet introduced, it commands a higher price. As a
result, foreign oil is being imported in bulk and sold
as Australian to the injury of-the honest makers, the'
growers and the considerable number of-laborers and
pickers for whom the industry finds work iri winter
when other forms of employment are most slack.
Feathers on the Axe.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I went out to do some chopping when the
sun was pming down.
For the evening it was chilly and I'd done
a freeze in town ;
But I found around the woodheap some
large, unfamiliar tracks,
And some little crimson splashes, and some
feathers on the axe.
Long' I gazed upon those feathers, ere I
wandered to the pen
Where our poultry do their laying. It was
short of one plump hen.
Then, still thinking very slowly, I repeated,
“ ‘One night we
Will have fowl —roast fowl for dinner.’ Now r
who made that prophecy?”
Then I counted all the splashes, and I
measured all the tracks,
And examined very carefully the feathers on
the axe.
With that evidence conclusive I could hardly
disagree;
And I found I’d guessed correctly—there
had been a tragedy.
Now the plumes are not annoying, and the
bloodstains don’t enrage,
When you know that you will later with
your knife and fork engage
On that bird so brown and tempting. But
you’ve got a right to squeal
When the laying hen you’ve cherished
makes another fellow’s meal.
And it makes you mad as blazes when you
miss a laying bird
And are lectured at the woodheap by a
lunatic absurd —
One who will not see the bloodstains, or the
strange marauder’s tracks.
And refuses to read “Murder” in the
feathers on the axe.
At the lone Australian woodhean die the
birds of industry;
And the murderers so Trustful do their rod
work openly.
For the cheerful, careless household never
follows up their tracks.
And refuses to be worried by the Feathers
on the Axe.

The Greater J. U. Williams Amusement Co., Ltd. William B. Miller, General Manager.
In October, 1910, the Metropolitan County Board
—the body which looks after the food supplies of
the Cify of Adelaide—published a report made by
one of its inspectors. This report revealed an im-
mense amount of substitution of foreign for Austra-
lian oil, and also a little adulteration with cotton-
seed oil. The latter fraud has been effectively
checked, but the substitution of olive oil of a lower
quality is difficult to detect by analysis, although
the difference may be apparent to the most inex-
perienced palate. The report of the inspector re-
ferred to contains the surprising admission from a
large manufacturer that “he found it necessary to
put up a particular French oil in South Australian
bottles”—necessary', I suppose, because he wanted a
larger profit, though I understand (possibly as a re
suit of his yielding to this occasional “necessity”)
he has since found it “necessary” to reduce his
prices.
The importation of foreign oil in properly-labelled
bottles is a competition which we do not fear, and
the Australian growers would, therefore, not object
if the duty on bottled oil were left as it is ; but the
bulk oil needs at least treble the present duty. No-
thing less will make it unprofitable to continue the
substitution that we complain about. Meanwhile, in
the absence of such a duty, the foreign oil pours
merrily in; only two or three months ago makers
were approached ’by a certain large firm of American
origin, who offered to supply' them with foreign olive
oil, “guaranteed pure,” to pass on to their Austra-
lian Customers under, of course, Australian labels.
Broken Hill has a strike on hand again.
N.S.W. owns an Arbitration Court which
was built to settle industrial disputes, and
the Court, backed by the whole nominal
tonnage and horse-power of the Law, in-
formed Broken Hill that the proposed move-
ment was illegal and couldn’t be tolerated.
But the King’s writ doesn’t run to any great
extent on the Barrier, and the people
laughed and struck. Now the nominal ton-
nage and horse-power of the Law doesn’t
exactly know what to do about the business.
From the Oldest Inhabitant: —
A sale took place last week, which, in the course
of a couple of years, will change the face of a cen-
tral Sydney' block. Farmer and Co. purchased from
the Burdekin Estate a frontage of 82ft. to George-
street and 85ft. to Market-street. It is estimated
that the value on George-street would be £BOO a
foot and on Market-street, £5OO. The existing leases
expire in March, 1915, when the firm will build on
to its already extensive premises in Pitt, Market and
George streets. This will leave Roberts’ Hotel bloom-
ing alone, entirely surrounded by Farmer’s buildings.
The premises purchased in George-street, and now oc-
cupied by the Crow'n Studios, were at one time held
bv J. B. Holdsworth, ironmonger, who succeeded to
the original business of Thomas Burdekin. The
latter, on arrival in 1826, had established himself in
the hardware trade. Immediately after the original
Burdekin came a somewhat notorious character
named Taylor, who for a time was in partnership
with one of the Uthers. Taylor absconded, leaving
many lamenting. A Mr. Hawley followed, and
then came J. B. Holdsworth. . The Market-street
frontage was at one time occupied by a noteworthy
citizen, Mr. Mountcastle, hat manufacturer and anti-
liquor enthusiast, who dropped a teetotal tract into
every lid he sold.
Money being now scarce, the N. S. Wales
Government has had to give up the idea of
bribing its way back to office, and has started
to bluff through, instead. Last Saturday it
performed with pomp and circumstance, not
to mention mere expense, the idiotic rite of
“turning the first sod” of a railway line
from Barellan to the Yanco irrigation area.
Then, after the first sod had been duly
turned, and the usual flapdoodle had been
well and truly doodled, a hint was thrown
out that of course the construction of the
line was dependent on the money market.
There wasn’t any cash to do it with at pre-
sent, but as soon as Cohen would lend the
needful at 4 per cent, this job would join in
the scramble with the rest. On a rough cal-
culation the Holman-McGowen Government
has turned the first sods and otherwise pulled
the leg of the country over works which
would cost f 10.000.000; and all of it is
bluff, for the Treasury is empty, and there
isn’t a ghost of an idea when it will be any-
thing else but empty.
According to Sydney Telegraph typhoid
has broken out on the training-ship Tingira.
and the matter is being “inquired into.”
The other day the same vessel was reported
to be a hot-bed of diphtheria. About six
months ago The Bulletin mentioned
gloomily that the Tingira was stationed in
one of the most shut-in and stagnant parts
of Sydney Harbor. The shores of Rose
Bay are well covered with houses and its
waters are none too deep. What with one
thing and another the effluvia in the neigh-
borhood of the picturesque beach which
stretches along the southern shore of this
inlet is. for the most part, and more especi-
ally at low tide, not so much high as it is
horrible. Meanwhile the summer is ap-
proaching, and thoughtless people may be
expected shortly to start bathing in’ the
various baths, private and public, which
lie over against the Tingira—a practice
which, by the present look of things, will
amount to toying carelessly with Death. It
seems to this paper that a far sounder
scheme than that of vaguely “inquiring'
into” the Tingira’s typhoid and diphtheria
epidemics would be to shift the ancient
vessel to some part of the harbor where it
would be less of a menace to itself and to
the adjacent population. It is quite on the
cards that after the Tingira has been moved
to some airy spot where the tide sweeps in
and out at a good round bat. and the con-
gested population problem is not, the dis-
covery may be made that the need for an
inquiry has suddenly vanished.

The Bert Bailey Co. was welcomed back
to its old Sydney stand, the Palace, on
Saturday night, by an audience that filled
the theatre and frothed into the roadway.
“The Native Born” was chosen to open the
season. This is an Australian drama —that
is to say, its setting is Australian, but its
constitution and habits are old friends. The
villain who leaves footprints like a megalo-
saurus round his secret schemes; the intel-
ligent hero who sees them not; the panto-
mimic police officer who detects' them at
about 10.15 p.m. although he has consistently
fallen up to his whiskers in them throughout
two acts, 116 scenes and a string of episodes
besides which the chain letter is brief and
fragmentary ; the sheep-hound fidelity of the
heroine, which would drive anybody but a
hero to strong measures or drink; the low
comedy man who “narks” the villain’s busi-
ness ; the adventuress who has loved well
but injudiciously—they are all there. Some
da.y there will arise a play-cobbler with a
mission to slightly alter the scheme of melo-
drama. His hero will be no pampered beauty-
man, but a bald-headed dub, with one leg
shorter than the other and beer stains on
his waistcoat. He’ll be married early in the
performance to a girl who loves cats and
hates babies, and he’ll be an 18-carat war-
rior and philanthropist for the rest of the
show. The villain will be a Well-Known
Business Man Whose Integrity is Above
Reproach, and when he starts after the
heroic citizen aforeasid realism will be a
revived art. But these things are prema-
ture.

It has to be counted to the credit of Bert
Bailey and Edmund Duggan, the authors of
“The Native Born,” that they have worked
a striking novelty into their story. Bailey,
in his character of a travelling conjurer and
magician, gives a capital exhibition of the
tricks of the trade whereby a gang of land-
dummying murderers are brought to
heel. One of the gang, straying into the
pitch-black mystefy joint, is confronted
with what passes for supernatural agencies
until, in fear of death and dread of the
flames of Gehenna, he cries a confession,
which clears the hero from suspicion and
fixes the blame where it belongs. To escape
the vengeance of the betrayed, he then bolts
for the ranges, and a fine scene is unfolded
of a snowstorm on Kosciusko. As far as
the acting is concerned, Bert Bailey is the
long suit. The characters of Dad "in “On
Our Selection” and Charles Spinifex, the
voluble showman, in “The Native Born,”
are the extreme ends of things, in a manner
of speaking, and Bailey has transferred
himself from one to the other with unusual
thoroughness. Guy Hastings, as the beau-
tiful young settler who trumps every trick
of villainy that Richard Bellairs, the
swindling land agent, plays, is another
strong prop. Several of the others in the
cast are hereby warned to promptly forget
“On Our Selection,” until later in the sea-
son, at any rate. The attempt to collar one
of the richest gold mines in Australia (pre-
sumably the Long Tunnel or the Garden
Gully in disguise) will be publicly foiled at
the Palace until further notice.

Paul J. Rainey’s hunt for big game at
Sydney Lyceum turns out to be a rather
tame affair. Perhaps it is that the animals
are at too safe a distance —somewhere in
Central Africa —or perhaps it would seem
more real with the assistance of the kineta-
phone. Also there is far too much of the
kind of picture you can see in any old school-
prize book. Still the film has several excellent
moments, notably when the cheetah and the
lion are being pursued. As a photographic
achievement the film stands high, but it
hardly makes a spectacular razzle.

On Saturday Bret Harte’s “Luck of
Roaring Camp” will interest the various
villains, journalists, heroes, heroines, stage
managers, musicians and others who, out of
curiosity or necessity, frequent the Adelphi
on first nights. Till then “Her Road to
Ruin” continues to be less bumpy than the
average Sydney road to anywhere.

Marian’s Dogs again head the bill at
Sydney Tivoli with a turn that is only note-
worthy because of the scarcity of good dog
turns. The place money is divided among
the Russian dancers, perhaps the most ex-
pert whirlers seen hereabouts ; the Primrose
Four, who must evidently assassinate the
orchestra in order to be heard to advantage;
the De Bruns, in their Turkey Trot and
Bunny Hug; and the Six Hoboes.
*A * *
The most bloodless scrap on record, so
far as Sydney is concerned, eventuated dur-
ing the earlier part of this week at the
Lyric, where the shades of Wells and
Mehegan chased each other over the screen
for 20 rounds. At the end of that time,
Referee Baker, who makes a beautiful mov-
ing-picture actor, gave Wells the decision
by three lengths. The office cinemaniac
isn’t a pug.-expert, but he would willingly
pay to see a fight between Wells and
sprinter Donaldson —it should be an even
better race. And a fight between Wells and
the ghost of old horse Carbine would be a
joy of no ordinary dimensions. The pic-
ture, considered coldly as a picture, was an
excellent one, and whoever was responsible
did his job well. By the way, and merely
as a tear-stained note on the most popular
tipple of the flicksomaniacs, the crowd
which couldn’t get inside the theatre on
Monday night was the largest this writer
has yet seen waiting its turn.
“The Butterfly on the Wheel,” now in its
fourth week, is still drawing the tears of the
Sex, at Sydney Royal. The managerial ad-
vertisement speaks very highly of it, and it
is described by the suburban lady with sighs
as “just lovely!” But the average suburban
man almost shouts his denial when asked
if he is going too. The breaking of butter-
flies and such-like pathetic spectacles don’t
attract him a bit. He would just as soon
pay to see a gazelle or a cow pushed over a
precipice.
a* * A
In much the same self-abasing spirit as
that in which a criminal owns up to having
burgled an indigent child’s money-box, and
swindled its poverty-stricken mother, and
robbed the family’s last-remaining hen-coop,
the writer hereby admits that the new show
at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, bores him the
more the longer it lasts. No need to furiously
proclaim him an intellectual pariah, devoid
of every trace of taste, poetic feeling, de-
cency, culture, discrimination, and so on.
He knows it all. The number of honest
local burghers who have been able at first
sight to read the finest shades of meaning
into the apparently purposeless leaps and
gyrations and hurried runnings of Gen€e and
her colleagues is astonishing—in fact, it is
almost incredible. Incidentally, it is a fine
tribute to the troupe’s press agents. It is
impossible, in the opinion of the degraded
being who is responsible for these lines to
acclaim too heartily the perfection of Gen’ee’s
technique. He has marvelled at it, in his
own dull, inarticulate way, for about 15
years, off and on; and it bewildered him
as much the other night as ever it did. But
it does not produce in him any overpowering
sensation of pleasure. To a large class it
is probably not obvious at all. How many
of those who rave fulsomely about Genee’s
skill appreciate the details in which it is
superior to that of some young and beautiful
performer of purely “fake” steps? Not five
in every thousand, in all likelihood. Her
skill as a mime, her humor, and a certain
attractive gaiety which radiates from her
quaint and childish face are things that
everyone can understand. But “dainty
adorable Genee,” “Youth, Spring and Sun-
shine are in her dancing”—this sort of over-
done adulation is as grotesque in her case as
it would be if it were applied to Melba or
any other well-seasoned star. Her airy skim-
mings; her portentous bounds; her imita-
tions of butterflies, and so on, are all unim-
aginably well done, but in the writer's
opinion they are far more amazing than they
are adorable. Deprived of picturesque cos-
tuming and a gorgeous stage setting, they
would not allure for half an hour. Picture
for example, a ballet on the concert platform
of the Town Hall, with a background of
cane chairs, and the dancers in modern
clothes. The thought is horrible. As a mat-
ter of fact, half an hour, or at the most an
hour, of stage-dancing pure and simple, is
as much as the average civilised audience can
stand. Two and a half hours is over the
odds, no matter how artistic the show may
be as a whole.
The “Coppelia” ballet is the sort of thing
that the abounds at the Paris Opera House
troop in to watch when the show proper is
over. It is a pretty little two-act story of
the passing fancy of a youth for a doll and
his sweetheart’s resulting jealousy—a kind
of combined fairy-tale and leg-show. V olinin
absurdly over-stresses the boyishness of
Frans. To see this splendidly-developed
man fluttering nervously behind pillars, and
quailing lachrymosely before the umbrella of
the doddering Coppelius, is suggestive of Bill
Lang enduring a public flogging from a light-
weight Archbishop. Genee looks very
charming when she is wheeled in as the doll,
and her pantomime is. of course, inimitable
throughout. Jan Zalewski plays the exas-
perated old toy maker along conventionally
comic lines. Chopin’s best-loved melodies
are played exquisitely by the Grand Opera
Orchestra throughout “Les Sylphides,” a
fanciful ballet, in which Genee, Schmolz,
Novotna and Volinin do amazing and pic-
turesque things. But here again the de-
based author of this notice admits to the
fact that not one of their elaborately
rhythmic leaps carries any special significance
to him. It is an arguable proposition that
the meaning of the sweetly plaintive music—
if, indeed, it has any particular meaning—
would be as effectively conveyed by any
other variety of leaps. How much of the
imperial Russian Ballet is Russian, and
how much is Australian, the writer is not
in a position to say, but what he does -pro-
claim is that it is great. The spectacle of a
couple of score of shapely and energetic
young people dancing in perfect unison, and
in the midst of a beautiful stage setting, and
looking as though they loved it, makes an
appeal that is universal. The ballets are
preceded by a delightful operetta, in which
Joseph Royer and Elena Kirmes do good
work.
** * *
Adelaide Royal has taken a long step
from the idealities of Gende and co. to the
hard, modern American “Within the Law.”
The season of Dance was all too short. A
second look at the Danish lady confirms the
impression that she is as fine a comedian as
anything.. As for the others, there was no
nv re satisfying item iff the whole season
than the. simple lovemaking polka of Volinin
and Halina Schmolz —the very embodiment
of youth and joyousness. And as for the
rest, the mechanical doll of “Coppelia” de-
serves at least a name on the programme:
and so does the Chinaman in the same scene.
* * :!= *
Adelaide Wondergraph is giving a first
Australian trial to “From Manger to Cross,”
a life of Christ worked out by the American
Ivalem Co. in Palestine, with interludes in
Fgypt. The scene of Joseph and Mary
encamped in the shadow of the Sphinx is
one of . the best. The backgrounds are the
real thing, and the acting is simple, with no
melodrama except an excusable touch by
Iscariot. West’s rely on a filmed version of
good old “East Lynne.” The Stagpooles
have been added to the King’s programme,
and Lucy Gillett, Irma Caron, Cummin and
Seaham. and Henri French to the Tivoli’s,
the seals and the rather-ordinary roosters
stay, on as before. And (with a plea for
forgiveness for dropping her in after the
seals and the roosters) Clara Butt is at the
Exhibition, charming and good-natured as
ever.

The Quinlan Opera season started tyran-
nically in Melbourne last Saturday at 6 45
p.m., the opening being a Wagnerian occa-
sion A Quinlan who reveals the glories of
K e lC i ar lte ?® f °i mer J t 0 a lar^e following
of the faithful is bound to reflect the Watr
nerian spirit of intolerance in his mana-
gerial advt., otherwise the faithful would
suspect him of a debased regard for the
Philistines. So he shuts the door at 6 45
and any late comers, having missed the ’bus’
must cool their heels on the mat until the
end of the long first act. It seemed rather
a mistake in business tactics to introduce
the early closing system on the first night
ere the enthusiasm of the Philists had been
warmed up. Die Meistersinger”-Angli-
cised into The Mastersmgers”—was Satur-
day’s programme. Only the Cult knows
why the title is translated in the plural
number, seeing that but one individual bat-
tler is a serious entrant for the Song Cham-
pionship, and he is practically allowed a
over. In T^.nllllclusG^ ,, tliGrc rtg four
or five entrants for the great sing-song,
which, after all, has little or nothing to do
with the champion’s undoing. Rut in
“Meistersinger” the one-man tournament is
the beginning and end of the opera. There
is no plot to dwell upon, apart from the
endeavor of Walther to obtain matrimony
with Miss Eva Pogner. she being the prize
offered to the winner. The local town-clerk
one Beckmesser (a name that speaks for it-
self), tries to put up a contest, but Beck-
messer is the trivial low comedian and
puerile villain of the piece, introduced only
as a foil to Walther. The other character
of importance is Hans Sachs, the cobbler-
poet of Nuremberg. He eventually figures
as a reminder of Goethe at Weimar, and is
posed in the limelight when the long night
closes. What a long, long night it is!
* * * *
By . uncompromising Wagnerians this
opera is accepted as a “true musical comedy.”
Walther’s song is said to be a “true Wag-
nerian melody of great charm.” Some of the
tedious conversations in music—“ Meiste-
rsinger” abounds in small talk —are “incom-
parably poetic” and so forth. All this is
true enough if the word “melody” be ac-
cepted in the Wagnerian and not in the old
Verdian sense. From first to last the slow-
going comedy is a wonderfully orchestrated
composition, of course, though it lacks the
all-round harmony of music, story, move-
ment and scenic effect which makes Wag-
ner’s mystical operas so impressive. The
incidents are too trivial. If Puccini is
blamed for fitting rich musical accompani-
ments to petty details in the sordid lives of
vulgar people, how can Wagnerians excuse
the wealth of orchestration lavished on the
puerilities of “Die Meistersinger”? But
this is beside the other question. What is
melody? If the captivating airs from many
Italian operas be melodious, if the barcarolle
of Offenbach possesses a melody complete
and fixed, or the long duet in the first act of
“Bohbme” be full of melodies broken and
fugitive, then it is clear that Wagner never
succeeds in getting there. The song of Wal-
ther aforesaid is not more beautiful or dis-
tinctively original than the average air which
a musical stockbroker extemporises on a
spring morning, whilst towelling himself
after his shower-bath.
The Quinlan performance is an admir-
able achievement. In the first act the or-
chestra drowns the voices as a rule, but
that is mainly the fault of the composer.
When the chorus comes to the rescue of the
principals—*-the poor principals for whom
Wagner shows so little consideration —the
effect is evenly balanced. “Meistersinger”
is not an opera that does the principals
proud. Only one character —Sachs the shoe-
maker—commands any respect to speak of.
Robert Parker, whose voice seems to have
lost a little of its old force, is a dignified
Sachs. Spencer Thomas, a sweeter and
fuller tenor than of yore, walks through the
colorless character of Walther; and Jeanne
Brola, in a very blonde wig, quite unrecog-
nisable as the Girl of the Golden West,
sings pleasinely as the harmless Eva.
Maurice D’Oisly, one of the new members
of the co., reveals a good tenor voice in a
feeble comedy part. William Dener acts
and sings well enough as the town-clerk, and
among a number of other minor-part singers,
new and otherwise, the excellent enunciation
of Mabel Dennis makes the deepest imnres-
sion. When she sings one alwavs knows
that the opera is being rendered in English.
Conductor Eckhold and Quinlan deserve all,
or nearlv all. of the applause that thundered
at them. Orchestra, chorus and staging
equal expectations.
# * # *
A packed house gathered on Monday for
“Rigoletto,” which is everything in music
and dramatic form that Wagnerian opera is
not. This indicated that Quinlan has again
got an all-round grip of his Melbourne audi-
ence. The performance, as on Saturday
night, was a success of general efficiency,
rather than of conspicuous excellence in par-
ticular instances. It opened with a pictur-
esquely Watteau-like scene in the naughty
Duke’s palace, where the well-dressed and
well-trained chorus put considerable intelli-
gence into its acting. The opera passed into
a Jim, irreligious light, and remained mostly
in tne dark to its gruesome close. Previous
companies have sung “Rigoletto” more ex-
citingly. Some of the music has been cut,
apparently, and one missed the old, tradi-
tional encores in a mild and modern treat-
ment of the work. But for those who like
f n oi^ ra non . e . the less for being restricted
jo .2 hours, this was a quite charming enter-
tainment. All that the orchestra had to do
was done to perfection. The leading lady
• S important factor, and interest centred
ln a eßce B yhe. She is exceptionally small
and pretty for a prima donna. Nothing so
young and fresh has been seen here in grand
opera since Musgrove’s company appeared
at the I rincess’s. Miss Lyne is a spirited
little actress, though still inexperienced, and
she is a singer of some importance. All the
same, her high soprano voice fell a trifle
short of expectations on Monday. It is
naturally musical in tone, but somewhat
hard and metallic in quality. W. J. Samuel,
in the name part, was always good in all
respects. Maurice D’Oisly, as the Duke,
supports a sufficiently good appearance with
a sufficiently good tenor voice. Robert
Veever gives a fairly impresisve basso effect
to the exceeding wickedness of Sparafucile,
the professional corpse-provider; and Gladys
Ancrum figures pleasingly and angularly as
the giddy sister of the above. The admirable
performance of one or two minor parts was
the more noticeable because the major im-
personations carried no great volume of
voice or weight or personality.

Wirths’ Circus, the large, unobtrusive or-
ganisation which makes money by stealth
and blushes to find it fame, is coming to
Melbourne this year with the first breath of
spring, instead of waiting for the Caulfield
Cup period to make its annual advent. The
elephant herd and the mob of Polar bears
will bring wattle branches by way of peace
offering., as it were, and the lions and the
tigers will be confettied with leaves of
almond blossom. The circus presents all
the old attractions, plus some that are new.
Hillary Long is one of them. Any citizens
who have not witnessed the spectacle of
Hillary sliding down 90ft. of wire on his
wonderful head, and marvelled at all the
other latest feats in the arena, are advised
to haste to the Hippodrome in Wirths’ Park
on or after Saturday night next.

The get-through-quick style of Fred Niblo
is once more revealed in “The Fortune
Hunter,” which arrived at Melbourne Royal
on Saturday. This time Niblo is one
Nathaniel Duncan, a member of the Wal-
lingford species, but avoiding Rufus’s
methods of self-enrichment. Like Rufuk,
however, he descends upon the boobs of a
wayback village, determined upon acquiring
a girl with dollars by the simple appeal of
a fraudulent exterior. Piety and gentility
being graces most attractive to Radville
maidens, Nat becomes a whale for early bed
and Sabbath observance, and affects a uni-
form that suggests a drummer for a Bible
Society. Soon he is the rage of the hamlet,
and in the matter of “skirt” is a victim of
continuous overcrowding. Also, the drug
store which he had entered at Od. a week
is converted from a neglected ruin to a
prosperous emporium, with daily rallies of
Radville’s female resources around its soda-
fountain and patent skin-food counter. After
this the very touch of Nat is magical. Jim
Graham, the ancient owner of the druggery,
is turned into a successful inventor; and,
after some sharp corners are turned. Nat
stalls off the wealthy Josie Lockwood, and
is in a position to tell Betty Graham that
she is the one. The story is told in the
slick fashion which seems extempore when
Niblo is the principal narrator. He is the
sort of success gained by effective use of all
the tricks that go to produce an engaging
personality. Ray Royce gives pleasant
assistance as the old inventor, though the
occasional quavers in his speech seem like
vocal embroidery. Miss Enid Bennett has
C * *■ H r Be “y according to the pattern
of Miss Josephine Cohan, and except in
her milder flights of passion, she is very
faithful to the original. Miss Marian Mar-
cus Clarke isn’t especially notable as Josie
Lockwood. Miss Holloway is kindly re-
garded as Angie. Robert Greig is at least
a physical argument in favor of the exist-
ence of a character like Kellogg. Apart
from the scenery, which is passable, and
the intervals, which are long, the only other
conspicuous feature of the play is the ex-
aggerated wink of Edwin Lester, which
turns a useful actor into a guy with his
countenance out of drawing.
** * *
A full house heard what Hugh Buckler
and co. had to say in “The Man on the
Box” at Melbourne Bijou last Saturday.
The play was gratefully received as toler-
able offering, with a crude bit of bellow-
drama robbing it of some of its strength and
cleverness. The bellowdrama is provided
by a wicked Russian Count, who might
have escaped disguised in his moustache
from a Marlowdrama. Later on, when he
tries a scheme of plan-snatching compli-
cated by inconvenient attentions to a
Colonel’s beauteous daughter, the suspicion
is confirmed, and one expects a Marlow
emissary to arrest him for desertion at any
moment. His only use in the show, appar-
ently, is to be insulted and discomfited by
Hugh Buckler, who carries on a joyous
masquerade as a coachman and butler
through sheer admiration for the lovely lady
aforesaid. Buckler affords some entertain-
ing comedy during the course of the dis-
turbance, but the rdle of the Man on the
Box doesn’t prompt him to any remarkable
feats of acting. Alfred Bristowe seconds
his chief as Charlie Henderson, though he
is less urbane and more theatrical than was
Gerald Souper in the part in Sydney. Ken-
neth Brampton (the Count), Reynolds Den-
niston (Colonel Annesley), Alf Scarlett
(Cassidv). and other gentlemen fracture
none of the rules of stage decorum, and
Miss Violet Paget’s acting as Betty Annes-
ley is a charming sedative. The scenery is
adequate, while the knee-breeches of the
statuesque attendants in the front of the
house give an air of unimpeachable dignity
to the approaches.

At Melbourne Olympia last week crowds
gave a noisy welcome to “Australia
Calls.” and voted it interesting as
a film and valuable as a warning.
“Captain Mary Brown,” a tale of
espionage and stolen plans, was the sec-
ond best entry on the bill of fare. In lieu of
coffee, the Olympia supplied “Round About
Cairo,” a good photographic guide to the
town where aristocratic England suns its
chilblains in the winter.
“AUSTRALIA CALLS.”
The Japs visit Sydney.
Failing in his intention to present “The
Confession” at Melbourne King’s on Satur-
day, Bill Anderson engaged Maggie Moore
to do a turn as the old-established heroine,
Meg the Castaway. Maggie is ample for the
part, and instantly dispels any impression
that Meg is a waif in the bantam division.
John Forde is the ancient dog fancier,
Spottem, who pinches little Bertie.. Max
Clifton is Bertie’s anxious parent. Roland
Conway portrays Samuel Sloper as a stiff,
lath-and-plaster sort of philosopher. Among
the others the roar of Edwin Campbell is
heard at intervals, while Temple Harrison
is a plump apparition temporarily leasing
the garments of coster Jones.

x Concerning eight Saxones and Bellora, the
monarch of mimics, due in the Melb. Opera
House bill last Saturday, The Bulletin
can only say that they didn’t appear at the
matinee. Doubtless they glittered at night
when this publication was too busy to see
them. Several vaccinated people from Syd-
ney will arrive next week, and, meanwhile,
Lola Krasavina continues to clothe her
vocalism in expensive raiment, and Flynn
and McLaughlin are dancing and singing as
before. Also, Martynne, who is a young man
thinly disguised as his sister, is still waving
two sticks with yards of light fabric
attached in the manner of many “serpen-
tine” dancers of long ago, but not in the
manner of the best of them. The tall Mul-
lers frivol deftly with hoops, and the two
winsome young Ivebble girls dance and
warble very sweetly. As for Lily Langtry,
the Havilans and the Glory Girl, their
nights are numbered.
* * * *
The girl who got “Married To the Wrong
Man” is repenting her error for six nights at
Melbourne Princess’s, where her time of
tribulation will expire on Friday. On Satur-
day another member of the suffering sex, or
the same one under another alias, will assert
the doctrine that “The Woman Pays,” which
will be gratifying news to her best bloke
next public holiday. These last revivals of
the Marlow co. (why not the Willoughby
co., if Marlow is out of the business?) are
preliminary to the return of Allan Doone.
** * *
“The Butterflies” have given the Majestic
in .Flinders-street, Melbourne, a very pro-
mising start as a vaudeville theatre. Jack
Waller and his six accomplices improve on
acquaintance. The men can do something
more than sing and say things, Waller in
particular being greatly addicted to versa-
tility. The three ladies are well assorted,
for whereas honey would hardly melt in the
mouths of two of them, the third sings comic
songs in a voice which resembles a heavy
fall of bricks. On Saturday the Butterflies
changed the programme considerably, and
offered further excuse for their success.
An Australian member of the Russian Ballet serais
a few lines about what happened in Adelaide
when it was discovered that the music had been left
behind in Melbourne, and that the season couldn’t
open as advertised. Genet’s ballet music is so rever-
enced by conductor Glaser that he never allowed any-
body else to handle it. How he came to forget it
knocked the dancers—well, bandy. “A rehearsal was
called for the Saturday afternoon, and it was not
till we were all on the stage that the news leaked
out. At first there was a whisper, then an uproar.
All the Australians fled to their dressing-rooms, leav-
ing the floor to the Russians; and, judging by the
noise, it looked as if they would kill Glason by
jumping on him and executing their glinka mazurka
in the orchestra well. Heaven knows what they were
saying, but it sounded like the midnight hour of the
31st of December, when bells, guns, crackers, rock-
ets, kazoos, hooters and sozzles send up their noises
simultaneously; the only difference being that this
noise was navy blue, with violet spots, deepening to
royal purple at the edges. What a chance for a
genius to write some appropriate music and turn the
scene to account as a divertissement.”
Longford, the producer of the “Australia Calls’’
film, tells about the Chinese officers and soldiers
who appear in the picture: “Every one of them was a
genuine Chinese, and not a white actor made up
for the part, and the fact made for realism. It was
by no means easy to get them, as the majority were
employed in the Chinese furniture factories at piece
work. They earned good money, and were naturally
loath to leave their work. Another trouble was the
long intervals in the construction of the picture, and
it was difficult to get the same characters filled by
the same men. Yet it was necessary to get them
once they had appeared in any previous section, for,
of course, they had to follow on. On several occa-
sions I had to hunt for my Chinese General Officer in
Command. After my third visit to the factory where
the highly illustrious Mongolian Kitchener toiled,
the proprietor became really annoyed ; and a China-
man annoyed is always humorous. He ‘fired off’ at
me in this wise: ‘Whaffor you makem war? Whaffor
you takem my countlyman away ? Me no savee!
Last week him losem thlee day, this weekem twloo
day. I ask him whaffor? He say, “Savee big war.”
I tell him war no savee; plenty full up.’ Then,
after a pause, he resumed : ‘Bv Cli’, you finishim war ;
Mllessis ’ (a very ostentatious ‘white-made furni-
ture only’ firm) ‘plenty swear telephone, wantem
wardlobe, chass-dlawers, allee samee. Me wantem
countlyman all time, savee?’ On another occasion
one particular man was missing, and to get over
the difficulty I had to appeal to my Mongolian
General Officer in Command. He walked over to a
Chinese garden in the vicinity and reappeared with
a very reluctant recruit, and remarked: ‘All li’, Mr.
Longford, this feller do-—these allee same,’ and,
despite the recruit’s vociferous ‘No savees,’ he did so.
During the operations over the Musketry School at
Randwick Rifle Range one of my squad had just
arrived from China, and spoke perfect English. To
hear him expound the mechanism of the Maxim
quick-firer, the telescopic range-finder and the pros
and cons of musketry and field ordnance generally,
was a revelation to more than one of the officers
undergoing instruction under Major Heritage.”
“Screen”: The pictures show in Australia this
week “The Sister’s Secret,” founded on Boucicault’s
Eretty little play of “The Prima Donna,” acted in
ondon under C. Kean, by our Australian friend,
Cathcart, also Lacy, Miss Heath (afterwards Mrs.
Wilson Barrett) and Agnes Robertson (afterwards
Mrs. Boucicault). The prima donna scorns a stock-
broking lover named Rouble, and is all for a Count.
Her young sister is in a decline, and, under the
delusion that the Count is after her. He and the
prima donna say. “Ah, very well, let the poor thing
imagine it while she lasts.” But, under love’s
magic, she gets well, and the Count, not displeased,
has to marry her, while the prima donna has to fall
back on Rouble. Not long after the first run of
this play, Boucicault and Agnes Robertson eloped to
America, leaving the Lord Hopetoun of that day dis-
consolate. Aggie was the ward of Mrs. Kean, who
had set her heart on the aristocratic match. Years
later, Governor Hopetoun—a son of that lord —curi-
ously avoided the Brough and Boucicault manage-
ment in Melbourne.
“Billy T.”: It really looks as if the old-fashioned
melodrama were going to pieces in Australia. At
any rate, during the last twelve months public inter-
est in the bad ass and the good idiot, the imbecile
angry father and the fatuous gentle one, has shown
itself shattered. General favor runs to the fairly
lucid, well-made play of moderately human men and
women, like “Within the Law,” or to the slap-dash
comedy of contemporaneous folk, like “On Our
Selection.” Australian managers are shaking their
heads dolorously over the successive shocking collapses
of sensation dramas and Worst Woman plays.

Nielsen, that very unmanageable supporter
whom the present N.S.W. Ministry got rid of
by sending him to the United States to report
on things at £4 per day and his Parlia-
mentary salary, is giving some value for his
money. He announces, on the strength of
his TJ.S. experience, that wheat crops need
never fail, “save in exceptionally dry sea-
sons, where the rainfall averages lOin. and
over.” Wonderful! Out of the 380,000
square miles which make up S. Australia,
nearly 318,000 square miles have lOin. and
under of rain. Yet S. Australia has long
been nicknamed “the Wheat State,” by rea-
son of the grain it grows in its allegedly
howling desert. If Nielsen had been sent to

Farthing, M.L.A., who represents beer
interests in the Vic. Assembly, asked last
week for a royal commission to inquire into
the causes of “the dissatisfaction with re-
gard to State education' in Victoria.”
Premier Watt replied that he had not heard
of the alleged dissatisfaction. Anyhow, he
is not likely to appoint any more royal
commissions just now, although, by the
way, there is a good deal of dissatisfaction
with regard to beer in Victoria.
“Henry Ilorsecollar”: It is a frequent
gag of the black labor crowd that the white
man is only fitted for cold countries. It
may be so, but certainly the cold country
theory may be overdone. A cablegram of
the other day told how 100 Russian fisher-
men’s families died on Nova Zembla owing
to the inclemency of the weather, and how
their bones have just been found. The last
survivors got down to cannibalism in the
struggle to maintain a flicker in the lamp
of life. The tale about frozen women and
frozen infants is a horror. Nothing like it
ever happened at Cairns or Cooktown, or in
the vicinity of Port Darwin. As a matter
of fact, the white man has had no luck in
fairly cold countries. Iceland had a boom,
but presently began to die out. Northern
Russia isn’t prospering. Greenland was a
tragedy which has hardly a parallel in his-
tory. The republic of Greenland was built
by Norsemen some time before the year
1000, and towns were established, and
churches built, and one or two cathedrals’
put up, and the place had ships and bishops
and monasteries and nunneries and other
appurtenances. In fact, the sturdiest white
race on earth started out to show how a
cold climate agreed with it. Later the re-
public froze and the place became a mere
possession. Then the Mother Country got
into desperate trouble, which lasted for a
century or two, and the parasitic outpost
was left to look after itself. That, of course,
was quite an ordinary thing. Any big
colony should be able to carry its own bur-
den in an emergency. England left its
North American property to look after it-
self more than once. Tyre left Carthage to
struggle for its own old Phoenician crust.
Spain left the vice-royalty of Mexico to
fight its own battle on occasion. But poor,
cold, bear-haunted Greenland, with its brac-
ing climate, was in a different category.
Presently it was noticed that ships and in-
formation ceased to arrive. Later it was
noticed that the fine, bracing settlement
hadn’t been heard of for a verv long while.
When the distracted Mother Country had
time and opportunity to look up its children
there were no children to be found. Even
the bishops and the cathedrals were missing,
though whether the last bishop ate the
cathedral or the last cathedral fell on the
bishop no one knows. Of the Governor-
General there wasn’t a shin-bone remaining.
If that magnificent adventurer, Erik the
Red, had planted his colony on the Katherine
River in Australia’s Northern Territory he
might have made history. As it was he
only made a very unpleasant circumstance.

Thomas Wilford, M.H.R., one of Maori-
land’s best known criminal lawyers, was
delivered of a fact in the House the other
night which has caused statisticians the
world over to get extra work when tallying
the gaol returns. Said he :
I do not care what magistrate you speak of, but
every magistrate is more or less, after many years
of office, a policeman. I do not mean to say he is
consciously biased, or that he does not give a fair
deal to a man who comes before him, but -I do know
well that it takes more than three civilians to out-
swear the oath of a constable. I know it takes quite
three civilians, at any rate.
As for mere blokes, it takes a drayload of
them to make any impression on the Beak
worth mentioning in calm language.
“Melb”: A statement that the Albert-
street Baptist Church, associated with Isaac
New and Charles Clark, had been replaced
by a hospital led me to visit thfr place. It
is still there, and has just been renovated.
The tabernacle that has disappeared is the
near-by Victoria Parade Independent
Church, which was bought by the R.C.’s,
who put in its place St. Evin’s Paying Hos-
pital, under the auspices of St.
Vincent’s. The first pastor of
the Independent Church which
has gone was S. C. Kent—the
man who, after he had attacked
Bishop Moorhouse for sacerdo-
talism, was actually persuaded
by that artful Gaiters to be-
come an Anglican vicar. A
very artful and diplomatic
Gaiters was Moorhouse, though
he made one bad break, when
he explained his lack of teetotal
fervor on. the ground that he
couldn’t digest “great masses of
food” without a little alcoholic
stimulant. Naturally someone
asked why lie didn’t do with smaller
masses of food and give the remaining shovel-
ful of victuals to the poor. It was a most
unlucky way for a wise bishop to describe
his dinner.
An Adelaide woman has been inquiring
what true Charity really consists of. She
was left a widow, and the usual kind neigh-
bors got up a “benefit,” which netted £36.
W hen she heard that one of the committee
had been paid £lO to square an old debt,
and that the rest was likely to go to other
creditors, she brought an action against the
treasurer for all money he had received.
The Court, however, believed (1) that the
fund was started to clear her of debts (her
late husband’s, apparently), and (2) that
she had said she could get along if onlv
this was done. So all she gets out of the
“benefit” is the knowledge that she won’t
be dunned to pay somebody else’s bills.

THE MAN FROM BYGOO : “ That's the first
lime I seen cockatoos swimmni '!"
“Looker-on”: People get a chance to
focus public events properly where there is
no hysterical daily press to whoop like a
tribe of Red Indians full of fire-water. The
forthcoming visit of the Imperial Parlia-
mentary party (of polite nonentities) is
one of those outwardly imposing events
that take up time to very little purpose,
litter the continent with broken victuals,
and end gloriously in dead maripes and’ in-
flated heads. The daily press is already
writing deafeningly on the subject, and the
man who is too busy to look round is liable
to think that something important is hap-
pening. He may even be betrayed into
showing signs of excitement and taking
expensive drinks. But, while the pres?
deafened city man is taking out his boiled
shirt, and his trade statistics, and his
humorous after-liquor stories, the country-
man, who doesn’t get the same amount of
printed noise, is comparatively calm about
it. The Mayor of Lismore (N.S.W.) called
a public meeting, last week, to make ar-
rangements for the reception of the
wandering obscurities from Westminster;
and if a clergyman hadn’t hurried along
from a mothers’ meeting, or something of
the kind, he would have been the only per-
son present—in fact, he would have been
the entire audience. On the whole,
the presence of the clergyman was rather
unfortunate. Heaps of men have been em-
nerors, kings and presidehts of republics;
but the number of men who have been
public meetings must be strictly limited.
The claim of the Vic. Police for Sunday
off —every alternate Sunday—with 28 days’
annual leave, as in N.S.W. —has public
opinion at the back of it. At present the
Vic. Police force is undermanned, because it
is insufficiently rested. The granting of
Sundays off would necessitate a strengthen-
ing of the force, and would make it less
unattractive to the class of young men who
are wanted. In fact, the general inefficiency
of the Vic. Police service begins with the
foolishness of expecting too much “dooty”
from the individual Hop.
Glenyarrah, an old homestead at Double
Bay, Sydney, has passed into the hands of
J. Spencer Brunton for £9500. It was the
property of the late T. H. Kelly—known as
“Tin” Kelly, tin being the metal out of
which he made his pile. Glenyarrah has
recently been the home of his son—the aider-
man. not Willy; Willy is a younger member
of the family. At one time it was the pro-
perty and residence of Samuel Deane Gor-
don, an old Parliamentarian and merchant,
whose stores were in the old building in
Bridge-street known a = the synagogue and
recently demolished. Brunton has made a
strikingly good bargain. Besides a fine
house, there are nearly four acres of land,
and an immense water frontage. It was
impossible to cut the estate un for building
nurnoses. since it has very little frontage
to the main road. The new owner is going
to enlarge the house and add on a new lot
of servants’ ooarters when he takes it over
at the end of the year.
From somewhere
in the wilds of
Papua:—
Australia, with its
wealth of scenery,
fauna and flora, instead
of having the most
uninteresting postage
stamps in existence,
should have the most
picturesque and inter-
esting. Going to every
hole and corner of this
planet, stamps offer a
unique opportunity for
advertisement. Show-
ing things or scenes
peculiar to the place
they come from, they
carry us to the sender’s
environment as soon as
the mailman reaches
us. Replace such de-
signs with uninterest-
ing profiles of person-
sonages, and we have
to read the letter over
and over again, and
then do not get the
atmosphere, unless the
writer wields an unusu-
ally descriptive pen.
Designs selected from
our fauna and sugges-
tive of the Common-
wealth as a whole
might be best for the
values most used, and
the most impressive
scenery from the vari-
ous States could be in-
troduced among the
others. If the Mon-
a r c h’s countenance
really does promote
loyalty, and glue the
Empire togther, and
all that sort of thing,
why not weave it right
into the fabric of the
paper as a watermark ?
More people see our
s t a m p's than hear
George Reid orating
shrilly amongst broken
victuals in London,
and a decent series of
Australian stamps would be a better advertisement
than our expensive dinner-eating bureau by the
Thames.
Great is the art of putting a good face
upon things. Bulgaria won great victories
at great cost at the beginning of the late
scrap. Then it tried to rob its allies of
their share of the plunder, and its allies
licked it. Adrianople, which it had won
from the Turk at awful expense, was lost
again. The little Bulgy kingdom saw
nearly a million enemies in sight of its
capital, and had to shriek to the Great
Powers to save it from obliteration.
Finally it got out of the trouble with much
damage. And when the battered wreck of
the army of Bulgaria limped back to Sofia
King Ferdinand rode in front with a wreath
on his helmet, and “the high officers were
adorned in greenery,” and the soldiers’ rifles
were “decorated with foliage,” and the army
shouted war songs. It must have been an
heroic effort.

ON THE WISDOM OF OBSERVING CERTAIN
HUMAN GAME LAWS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The N.S.W. Government, which reprieved Moir,
Phillips and others, only decided at the very last
moment not to hang Wright. —News item.
When the wish to slaughter someone grows intoler-
ably strong ;
When you feel you’ve held off butchery inordinately
long ;
When the blood-lust wildly burning
In your bosom sets you yearning
For a throat or two to finger ;
Don’t irresolutely linger
In the State of Watt and Murray.
Make for—shunning needless hurry—
New South Wales,
Where the effort to escape from hanging very rarely
fails.
But be careful of the time when you invade the
Mother State.
Guard against arriving early: see you don’t trans-
pire too late.
It enjoys, for some weird reason,
Both a close and open season,
As regards assassination ;
Therefore use discrimination.
Rhadamanthus only dozes
Till the slaughter-season closes ;
When he wakes.
He who slays for sport or profit risk incalculable
takes.
Here’s a tip which chronic murderers will find a
priceless boon :
He who spurns it is the maddest sort of suicidal
loon ;
Let our country’s firearm-users —
Wainrights, Deemings, thugs and bruisers—
Rest discreetly from their labors
On the bodies of their neighbors,
And behave with circumspection
When a New South election
Heaves in sight.
Otherwise enraged Justice may arise—and then good-

either the Derby or Oxford laced style, whole goloshed, with
close finely stitched, medium-weight soles, linen lined,
liai.'-watertight closed tongues and smart, extended, medium-
round toes. The quality of the leather is reliable throughout—

A man who is at present on his way to
Perth is making the journey mainly through
his failure to grasp a great opportunity.
He was arrested in Melbourne nominally
for embezzling 7s. o(l.—the law having a
quaint way of accusing a man of stealing
30s. or so when he is, in fact, sus-
pected of having got away with
£30,000 more or less —and was re-
manded to Perth. But as be wasn’t vac-
cinated the shipping cos. cordially declined
to let him go on their boats ; and as there
was no other feasible way for him and the
accompanying John to get there, a nice posi-
tion arose. The shipping cos. couldn’t be
compelled to take him, and he couldn’t be
compulsorily vaccinated, being obviously
more than six months old ; also, though he
might be remanded a time or two, the pro-
cess couldn’t be continued indefinitely,
Habeas Corpus being still in force. So it
looked as though he would have to be dis-
charged whether he was innocent or not;
but he solved the difficulty himself by agree-
ing to be vaccinated, and thereby lost the
Law a fine chance of getting itself out of a
tight corner.
THE PRODIGAL SON.

One of the youthful trainees from the
John Murray training ship, moored off
Port Melbourne, has been finally withdrawn
from that floating paradise. He made his
sixth escape the other day by swimming
ashore—-a one-mile trip. Owing to his evi-
dent distaste for a seafaring life it is now
proposed to put the 14-year-old hero on the
land. It might be more sensible to train
him for the Dover-to-Calais swim.
In uniform, or out of it, a policeman be-
comes the most popular of public servants
(next to the postman) whenever he goes
on the philanthropy beat. Other workers
in good causes excite suspicion. They have
an air of wowsering, and their visits are
unwelcome because they w r ant something,
anyhow. But a policeman’s appeal for help
for a public charity is as affecting as the
sight of a strong man in tears. Some_ of
the most effective work for the Hospital
Saturday and Sunday Fund is done in Mel-
bourne and suburbs by the Police Band
collectors, on the door-to-door system. The
volunteers for this work are Johns who
give their spare time to it and find mental
dissipation in going around with money
boxes—dungeon cells, with narrow slits in
the roof—where loose cash is * taken into
custody. It’s a long job, extending over

several weeks, for a policeman is mostly on
duty, and a lot of his spare time is wasted
in finding he will have to call again. But
he gets there more effectively than anybody
else could get there on the same errand.
About 12 of him are engaged in the door-to-
door collecting, and last year the result was
This year a bigger sum is expected.
“Bloore”: About the most important
official in a public hospital is the cook ; but,
somehow, the house committee, or whoever
it is. that manages the show, never seems to
realise this. As a long-suffering inmate I
want to barrack for a School for Hospital
(looks. At present any old person from
the registry office suits, and tons of good
food is hauled out to the back premises
simply because it has been murdered in the
kitchen. I have been
six weeks a patient,
but I have not had a
meal yet, for the
simple reason that the
255.-per-week cook
knows nothing about
cooking, and on the
salary is probably not
anxious to learn. It
is decidedly more im-
portant that a good
chef should be in
charge at (say) Syd-
ney Hospital than at
the Australia. If the
guest is not satisfied
with the tucker at the
Castlereagh-street es-
tablishment, he can go
to the one in the next
block ; but the “bloke”
in ’orspital has no
choice. If there is
anyone who can lay
his pen on his con-
science and write a
testimonial praising
public hospital cook-
ing I will bite my
mattress. And if you only knew what my
mattress was like you would realise what a
dreadful threat that is. #
Some men understand horses —others
think they do. Recently a Victorian farm
worker, walking with his employer past a
paddock where a horse was grazing, re-
marked that the prad was the quietest ever
seen. To prove it he went and caught the
beast by tile tail and hung on, his feet
dragging while it trotted casually round the
paddock. But he hung on too long, for the
“quiet horse” presently stopped, two heels
shot out, and there is another farm worker
sampling horses in the Elysian fields now.
It is a solemn fact that Sydney Govern-
ment House stables, over which the latest
judicial appeal is being made, were not built
for Government House, but Government
House was built for the stables. Macquarie s
idea was to build a man-residence and a
horse-residence after the castellated fashion
now seen in the stables; but money was
short just then, so Macquarie decided to go
ahead with the little job first. The site of
the house had not even been fixed at the time,
and later on it was vaguely referred to as
being somewhere “between the stables and
Fort Macquarie.” Subsequently the Mac-
quarie influence was employed to have the
house built at Potts Point, as that place
had become the residential area of the official
classes. Against this scheme it was urged
that it would render the stables useless, as
they would be too far away. In this dis-
pute Colonel Barney was appointed a sort of
referee. It was he who fixed the present
site of Government House, the palatial
raoke-premises being the cause of the house
being where it is. In this matter the horse
ran the show.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Associated with the persistence of the high ores-
sure over eastern Australia, cold weather is being
experienced generally in Queensland, New South
Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, and many frosts have
occurred, of such consistent and widespread nature
as to assume the appearance over the greater part of
these States, of a huge white sheet. —Daily paper.
I feel as frisky as a frozen sheep ;
My mind is heavy as a side of beef;
When once again comes Spring, I'll dance and leap,
For warmth will bring to my cold feet relief.
I am aware of feet remotely numb ;
My legs, I know, attach them still to me;
But they are dead, and 1 am very glum,
For cold holds up sedentary industry.
If I could coax the blood down to my feet,
With this old power station in my chest,
My pen would be as any greyhound fleet,
And I would spin a jingle with the best.
If I could take a walk —but walking won’t
Help on the joblets that I have to do.
Yes, Winter’s tramping time—but writers don’t
Go out for tramps. They sit still and go blue.
Blue is the summons on the ink-stained floor ;
Blue is the outlook as my idle hands ;
Blue is the sighing, keyhole creditor,
Who for long periods on the doormat, stands.
White is the pall above the prostrate land.
How smooth it lies —old Winter’s winding sheet
That Spring will rip with youth’s impatient hand!
Oh, would that Spring were here to thaw my feet!

The Bulletin receives a letter from its
old friend “Barabbas” :
On borrowing the last issue of your shameless in-
fliction froni the local preacher who resides oppo-
site, 1 was astounded to note that you not only ex-
hibited that callous audacity fur which you are
notorious, by publishing a communication of mine
of a strictly private nature, but you also in your
supreme egotism mutilated the most important and
effective details.
This is a contemptible subterfuge to prevent a
deluded public from discovering the farcical attempts
of your staff to posture as a body of literary and
artistic celebrities.
Possibly it was also due to your lack of effective
and original copy, together with that monopoly of
insufferable vanity and ignorance that Bohemians
of your unenviable estate take unto themselves.
To be in juxtaposition with such journalistic
schemers as your mentally deranged minions, to a
sensitive mind would cause a fatal development of
Carcinoma of the Medulla Oblongata.
My solicitor had great difficulty in preventing me
from taking drastic action in the matter, and only
prevented a gigantic law suit by appealing to my
high personal self-respect and deeply cultivated
altruistic principles. He assured me that my reputa-
tion would be irretrievably shattered if I entered into
any close acquaintanceship with such degenerated,
clownish, fantastic whims of evolution as your tac-
tics demonstrate you to be.
This sort of autocratic treatment is all right for
the degraded types of psychological monomaniacs
who- worship at the shrine of literary dissimula-
tion, and like —•
Poor souls with stunted vision
Measure giants by their narrow gauge.
Now that is Poetry f Not the sort of jangled ver-
sification that appears in your hyperbolical bur-
lesque, inspired, I am grieved to state, more often
than otherwise by cheap intoxicants. Thank Heaven,
ere long you will meet with that violent doom that
awaits inevitably for all trusts, combines and
pseudo-journalistic squibs.
Your aggressive self-importance is paraded on
every iniquitous page of The Bulletin.
A casual reader with opinions of his own is
nauseated at the inflated jargon of your leaders.
Who are YOU??
You say, we think, we know the Japs are coming.
We predict the future of the Labor party to be this
or that. Who are WE ?
Anyone would surmise that The Supreme
Ruler of • The Universe had taken temporal
control of your nefarious and impotent rag.
It makes one’s gorge rise to observe this
continual egregious appropriation of all the
available limelight. What right have you to foster
your immoral opinions on that fierce independence
of thought that stands out in brilliant idiosyncrasy
anent the great democracy of Australia?
And, furthermore, the shameless caricatures of
honorable men you so wickedly wallow in is inex-
pressibly revolting. You ignominously drove poor
George Reid out of this picturesque- country, and I
can metaphorically photograph the conscience-
stricken appearance of your saturnine physiognomy
at this very moment. Well may you flinch at the
indictment. A despairing country points with
scorn, and exclaims in tragic sorrow, Ecce Homo.
Who gave you the right to indulge in such abom-
inations? I am acquainted with a narrow-brained
fanatic, who, blinded with superstition and awed bv
the devilish reputation that attends such fiendish
productions as yours, endeavors with peristaltic
audacity to impress me with the slander that if it
had not been for The Bulletin the same George
Reid would at present.be living m respectable ob-
scurity.
Of course, this sort of thing is pandering to your
base and corrupt ideals, and I have little doubt that
vou will take this as a flattering unction to your
supine sophisticated intellect. Probably carried
awav in a fit of mental aberration and a paroxyism
of vanity, vou will stand drinks for the tottering
dipsomaniacs of your menagerie. That doesn t
trouble me.
But I say that a man who will give a disreput-
able over-advertised, under-capitalised, transcribed
concern like The Bulletin credit for swaying
national matters in that gigantic way is a maling-
ering imbecile.
I note, also, and I have no wish to add another
tame joke at the expense of a great man I say, i
note that our present Federal Premier is not spared
bv these wretched wasters you employ, and who
haunt your dissolute premises for their beer honor-
ariums, and commands to caricature our most bril-
liant statesmen. What excuse can your immortal
soul find in extenuation of the presumption in making
Mr Cook ridiculous in the eyes, of an adulatory
generation? What’s wrong with him. anyway? Phre-
nologicallv his head is not what it might be but
that’s no'fault of his. Darwin’s greatest work has
illustrations that compare with it on some salient
points, but that’s no concern of yours. \ou spare
not even the most exalted in your dissipations, and
whv the Honorable Bruce Smith submits to your
travesties on his grotesque appearance from the
artistic standpoint baffles inquiry.
And who, may I take the liberty of asking, is the
extraordinary personage who “Answers your Corres-
pondents?”
Of all the bumptious, fanatical, irritative, perm-
cious, sarcastic, unvaccinated and disreputable
scoundrels that ever took upon himself to torture
refined intellects, exuding splenic diatribe at every
nore he alone stands unique. Subliminal minds
that’soar infinitely bevond the inebriated horizon of
his squalid and absolutely inferior intelligence, stag-
ger and reel at the dictates of this fiend, who I
diagnose as being a victim to a complaint known as
Osteoporosis of the Upper Jaw.
Personally, I don’t know the man, and have no
desire to make his acquaintance. And as it is far
from my mind to indulge in personalities of any
description, I would not care to attempt an imagin-
ary vision.
However, as a mild synopsis, I should take him
to be a small attenuated species of tuberculin with
a fluorescent proboscis, a cranium akin to a moult-
ing magpie hatched in a secondhand incubator, and
well-developed bunions on both elbows caused by
pushing manuscripts into the wastepaper basket.


The Legislative Assembly is a more
unhappy family, than ever. The re-
cent crisis debate, ending as it did in
a fiasco, merely embittered the pre-
vious relations between the Corner
and the Government; and this feet
ing breaks out in intermittent bursts
of splenetic accusations.—" Age.”

“Lagani Namo”: Papua shelters a dog
which hasn’t a bark in its vocabulary, any remarks
considered necessary being made in snarls, yowls,
snaps and growls. The brute is a pink-eyed, any-
colored, invariably-mangy, pessimistic mongrel, with
some kangaroo in his family tree. Nevertheless,
he is responsible for most of the pig,- wallaby and
cassowary on Brown Brother’s dining-table. And
Brown Brother’s love and affection for his gallant
hound is exemplified in the Pqrari cannibals, who
would turn aside from any delicacy to masticate
roast dawg with sago auxiliaries. When deceased,
the animal’s teeth are used for trade, 10 being good
for one shilling where the supply is plentiful. Else-
where the white trader will pay 30 in return for a
hag of copra worth £l.

poses, the water is often deadly, poisoned by the
timber soaking in it. Some timber is far more
poisonous than others; ironwood is especially danger-

not knowing of this hidden danger, which often lies
invitingly handy to the hot and thirsty tracks that
run through derelict mining districts, where the

The Mussel” : I don’t know whether the
following is a case of “concentration of thought,”
singleness of purpose,” or plain idiocy. The chaff-
cutting gang, with all its impedimenta (traction-
engine, cutter, steamer, etc.), had painfully and
clamorously negotiated about four miles of the road,
when it was discovered that an axe and shovel had
been left behind. knows, or should know,
that a traction-engine\ias to be dug up out of the
bowels of the earth at intervals varying from 2yds.
to three miles, according to the nature of the coun-
try. Hence the necessity of the shovel and axe.
The boss sent an importation called Jobinsmith
back in the sulky to pick up the missing imple-
ments. After about half a day Jobinsmith returned
without the implements. He was in a confused
state of mind, and only after a rigorous cross-exami-
nation, conducted with much healthy profanity, were
the following curious facts elicited. He (Job.) had
seen both the axe and the shovel, which were lying
some distance apart. He started by looking for the
axe first, and in his wanderings saw the shovel
several times, but no sign of the axe. Then he
remembered about the shovel, but could only find
the axe, which he had dismissed from his mind for
the time being. And so it continued: when he was
searching for the axe he could only find the shovel,
and when he was searching for the shovel he could
only find the axe, till he gave up the search in
despair. The boss, who is unscientific, irritable and
prejudiced, became insulting. I know of cases
where other persons have consumed my beer and
have alleged absent-mindedness. But these appear
to be more cases of “singleness of purpose.” And,
anyhow, the general character of these persons in-
clines me to believe these phenomena weren’t
genuine. But I’ll swear to Jobinsmith’s utter sin-
cerity.

“Catamain” : There’s a fairly large red ant
in Australia that builds a nest, the surface workings
of which are just a heap of loose gravel, the whole
apparently so flimsy that you’d back the proprietor
as being the king nomad among insects. In reality
he sticks as long in the
old spot as the average
gravedigger, hangman or
political representative of
Fat. I have seen scores
of these nests still in use,
with the ground trodden
down hard all round, and
nine or ten tracks, worn
down by the ants’ hoofs,
radiating away and taper-
ing from 12 inches in
width, and two to three
inches in depth to vanish-
ing point. Some of these
tracks are over 100 yards
in length, and have sev-
eral side-tracks running
off them. They are as
hard and bare as any bush
bridle track. I kept my
eye on one nest for five
years, and although it was
a comparatively new nest
and only had one main
road leading from it, that
road’s appearance was not
appreciably altered the
whole time. It was 80 yards long, four inches wide, and
an inch deep at the residential end when I first ob-
served it.
“Dux”: Wool is up, and Jack Maori, who
runs sheep in Ilawkes Bay (M.L.), is flush. And
when Jack’s pocket feels heavy there is no holding
him. He strolled into a garage the other day, and
was lost in admiration before a spanking car. “How
much the ride that fella?” he inquired. “That’s not
for hire,” replied the boss, “but you can go for a
spin in this one,” pointing to a smaller jigger. “No
fear,” said Jack, shaking his head. Then he thought
for a while, and suddenly asked, “How much the
big fella?” “Twelve hundred,” replied the boss.
“Right! I take him,” said Jack, and he produced
a battered cheque-book and painfully spelled out the
magic words. The bank weighed out the coin all
serene, and Brown Brother went off satisfied. He
had “the ride in that car,” and next week he will
dispose of what’s left of it for £5O, or thereabouts,
and go back to work. Jack is a tiger for having
his own way about things.
THE NEW FARM
HAND ARRIVES.
“Gil Gunnia”: Have lately seen some
strange happenings up in the Mitakoodi country,
which lies out from Cloncurry(Q.). Brother Binghi, of
the Mitakoodi tribe, finds a fish diet well to his lik-
ing, and to gratify his appetite resorts to the old-
fashioned pastime of poisoning his prey. He uses
the too-ta, which everyone in West Queensland knows
as the “blue pest.” This shrub Brother collects,
crushes and bruises, and finally macerates with
saliva into pulp. The mess is thrown into the
waterhole, and if it is a small hole the fish are knocked
silly in half an hour, or thereabouts. In the larger
lagoons it takes more like a day to work. The
water gets dark and evil-smelling, and the fish rise
to the surface, where, after they have kicked a few
fantastic capers, they are pounced upon. The most
common fish in those parts are perch and a fresh-
water catfish. Binghi kills his prey by biting deeply
into it just at the back of the head. It’s quick and
sure, although it seems a ticklish job to perform on
a catfish. Of course, poisoning is not the only way
of getting a fish lunch. Spearing and puddling are
in vogue, too.
“Eddyson”: Alexander McAllister’s pud-
dler had been robbed. The stuff McAllister was
puddling at the time was worth less than a penny-
weight to the load, and if the thief got half
an ounce for the day he was lucky; but had you
heard McAllister’s barbaric Scottish noises next
morning you might have imagined he had lost a
leg. Alec’s suspicions fell upon Tinker Smith ; but
there were no direct proofs of Tinker’s guilt, so
McAllister was compelled to content himself with
circumstantial evidence, and everything of monetary
value that went into Smith’s house thereafter was
confirmation strong as holy writ. “Aye, aye,” he
would say, regarding Tinker with lowering hate,
“it’s verra easy ta have sassidges ta eat when a
mon is no’ beyond helpin’ himself ta ither people’s
property.” Or: “I’m hearin’ maister Tinker is
wearin’ a bran’ new pair o’ butes. We a’ ken
where yon comes fra. No’ fra his ain earnin’s, mark
you; an’ I wouldna meention the robbery b’ me
puddler at sic a juncture, mind ye, if I werena’
richt sure wha the robber really was.” For over a
year McAllister never passed the domicile of Tinker
Smith by night without wrenching a picket off the
fence, or helping himself to a cabbage, or a stick of
firewood, or some other item of small value. “It is
a sin ta steal a pin, mind ye,” said McAllister,
“’n’ I’d no imperil my immortal soul for mere
wor-r-ldly possessions; but there is sic a thing as
retr-r-ribution, ’n’ it’s no irreligious, I’m thinkin’,
when a mon helps himself ta his ain.” Then
McAllister would take another cabbage, and go
home. When Tinker Smith indulged his wife in
the luxury of a second-hand perambulator for their
third child, Alexander admonished the family over
its own back fence. “Lord forgi’ ye!” he cried.
“Lord forgi’ all o’ the Smiths, ’n’ Lord forgi’ me
that can’t forgi’ ye sic extravagance, knowin’ better
than the Lord, mebbe, where th’ money kim from.
If I were no’ a honest man I could ha’ braw kerridges
for me bairns, too, na doot.” But McAllister re-
served his finest performance for Tinker Smith’s
funeral, which happened close upon five years after
the rifling of Mac’s puddler. As the procession
drifted slowly past Alexander McAllister’s door, Alec
ran out, and danced with anguish on the dusty road,
his eyes fixed upon Smith’s black and silver casket
visible through the glass walls of the hearse. “Aye,
madam,” he yelled, “a braw funeral; but if ivery
mon had his richts, yon beautiful coffin would no’
be Tinker Smith’s this day. It would be mine,
madam, mine, mine!” And McAllister capered a
heathen Highland war-dance, and shook his large,
red, hairy fist at the chief mourner, till the funeral
passed out of sight round Mahon’s corner.
The Victorian aboriginal station of Lake
Condah is being asked to show cause why it shouldn’t
maintain itself. This refuge of Black Brother has
for 37 years been under the kindly sway of the Rev.
Stahle, who during all that time has rarely missed
his daily exhortation of “Led us bray.” On his
retirement, Crawford, from the Government
Viticultural College, assumed the reins, and
forthwith staggered the local black by announcing
that the fertile lands of the station should pay for
the upkeep of the place, with the assistance of
Binghi’s labor. And to attain that end, he added,
a new mixture, consisting of a little less gospel and
a little more work, would be put through the car-
buretter. At first the machinery back-fired a bit,
but now Abo. has settled down to useful employ-
ment.

TO STOP PALLING HAIR.
Falling hair—the forerunner of baldness
- is nearly always due to the presence of a
parasite. known as the dandruff germ. If
your hair falls out the chances are ten to
one that the dandruff germ is the cause of it,
and you cannot do better than to get your
chemist to make you up a bottle of the old
reliable formula, consisting of 3oz. of Bay
Rum, loz. Lavona de Composee and £ dram
Menthol Crystals. Apply night and morn-
ing, rubbing briskly into the scalp with the
finger tips. This preparation, which enjoys
a world-wide reputation as a hair grower
and dandruff destroyer, is popularly known
as Lavona Hair Tonic, and many chemists
keep it prepared ready for sale. Lavona
Hair Tonic is. claimed by many to restore
grey. hair to its original color as well as
making the hair grow, and destroying the
dandruff germ.*
Railway Superintendent Milne, of Orange
(N.S.W.), lately headed a party to the spot where
explorer Oxley crossed the Lachlan, near Gobothery,
on July 29, 1817. The party located one of the
carved trees mentioned in Oxley’s journal; but the
chief’s grave, which the irreverent explorers opened
and refilled, was missing. The tree is worth pre-
serving as a specimen of Binghi’s art, but the van-
ished sepulchre needn’t be wept over. Its vanish-
ment will make some inquisitive ghoul get honest
toil, and, anyhow, Oxley has told us all we need to
know about it
The form of the whole was semi-circular. Three
rows of seats occupied one half; the grave and an
outer row of seats another. The seats formed seg-
ments of circles 50, 45 and 40 feet each, and were
formed by the soil being trenched up from between
them. The centre part of the grave was about sft. high
and about 9ft. long, forming an oblong-pointed cone.
The whole outward form and appearance of that
place was so totally different from that of any cus-
tom or ceremony in use by the natives on the east-
ern coast, where the body is merely covered with a
piece of bark and buried in a grave about 4ft. deep,
that we were induced to think that the manner of
interring the body might also be different. On re-
moving the soil from one end of the tumulus and
about 2ft. beneath the solid surface of the ground
we came to three or four layers of wood lying across
the grave, serving as an arch to bear the weight of
the earthly cone or tomb above. On removing one
end of these layers, sheet after sheet of dry bark
was taken out, then dry grass and leaves, in”a per-
fect state of preservation, the wet or damp having
apparently never penetrated even the first covering of
wood.... The body was deposited about 4ft. deep
in an oval grave 4ft. long and about 18in. to 2ft.
wide. The feet were bent quite high up to the
head, the arms having been placed between the
thighs. The face was downwards, the body being
placed east and west, the head to the east. The
body had been carefully wrapped in a number of
opossum skins', the head bound round with a net
usually worn by the natives, and also the girdle.
The bones and head showed that they were the
remains of a powerful, tall man. The hair on the
head was perfect. ... He might have been between
30 and 40 years of age. To the west and the north
of the grave were two cypress trees, distant between
50ft. and 60ft. The sides towards the tomb were
barked and curious characters cut on them.
An ancient Binghi, who still borrows an occasional
sixpence round those parts, reckons that in his youth
he heard the Oldest Inhabitant of the Calare tribe
remark that the grave was the property of a Lach-
lan River chief and “karadga” (medicine) man, who
was drowned in a flood. The Sydney Museum is
now on the track of the illustrated tree.

“Werrimee”: On Mount Hutton Station,
in the Dawson country, there was an outcamp hut,
which, like a lot more bush huts, had the reputation
of being haunted. A swagman was camping there
one night when a man in a long white shirt dropped
in and asked for a pipe of tobacco. There was
nothing unusual in this request. But when night
falls on a lonely place and animated white draperies
become part of the scenery, the situation is not
quite satisfactory. The swagman said he had left
his tobacco on a stump outside and would go and
get it. He went, but he forgot about the tobacco
' util he reached the homestead. However, he said
it <’idn’t matter. A day or two later one of the
1 .nds brought in the swaggie’s drum, and reported
l at the ghost had been seen at different stages
farther on. It was a married ghost, travelling with

“Ginger” : When a man is down and out,
possessing neither money nor marbles; when he is
scratching gravel to the next town, where he doesn’t
know a soul, and the publicans bear a bad name;
when he would pawn his soul for a glimpse of a
good Samaritan—when a man feels like that, then
I’ll take a ticket on the local doctor. I never knew
a doctor in Australia turn a tramp down. He is
always good for a couple of bob, and sometimes for
a bit of tucker and fare to the place where the
mythical permanent bil’et is
waiting for the poor but honest
lug-chewer. The priest runs the
doctor to a short head. Walk
right up, ring the bell and intro-
duce yourself to his Reverence.
Strangers sneaking round the back
way to the housekeeper are objects
of suspicion, and regarded as
emissaries of Dill Macky. His
Reverence, in any case, is good
enough for a hand-out of prime
tucker, and, if fat and jolly, for
a couple of bob for the track
as well. Publicans are not bad,
and weigh in with some tucker
and a drop in the billy ; likewise,
if you’ve been there before and
made a name for yourself, a few
bob. Politicians, as a rule, are
mean. I have met two honorable
exceptions—the late Paddy Crick
and the recently-deceased Oom
Bill Lyne. Nugget and I
both waited on the Grand Old
Man of the Hume. He wrote us
out an order on a local store for
“whatever we wanted” instanter.
Putting the order in my pocket I
coughed. Whereupon Oom Bill
genially intercepted: “Ah, yes, the
track.” He dipped his hand in
his right-hand trousers pocket and
I benefited to the extent of 18
bob. Then he prospected the
aperture in the left leg of his
pantaloons, and bestowed on Nug-
get 22 pieces of the root of all
evil. After that, he shook hands
with us and sent us on our way
rejoicing. Paddy Crick was
another white ’un when the
man with the swag dropped in.
But these are exceptions, whereas to ours, the oldest
profession in Australia, the medical fraternity is all
prizes and no blanks.

“Yaral”: The raw immigrant has pene-
trated to the Golden Mile. One of him was starting
his first shift underground. When handed the usual
candles, he exclaimed: “Blime, Mister! Won’t a
man be up before dark?”
“Pick”: Backed up by much experience
in the loss of dogs from tick bite, I cannot recom-
mend the recipe given on the “Abo” page (B.
17/7/T3). When a tick fastens upon a dog or any
other creature, he does so with the object of getting
sustenance, and will hang on for days without much
inconvenience to his victim. When disturbed, how-
ever, he instantly injects poison into the puncture
he has made, and to immerse the little beast in the
liquid contained in the neck of an upturned fire-
water bottle would be the very thing to stir up his
wrath and make him spurt forth all his venom. The
surer way is to cut him off with a pair of scissors,
without allowing him to suspect your intentions.
Then place the dog in a damp, shady place, and
leave him. If he is a good dog he will usually die;
if a mongrel he will probably be robbing the pantry
again within a few days. But in either case a sun
bath is always fatal.
* * * *
“Leo Lear”: The beautiful rifle bird (the
only bird of paradise in Australia, by the way) has
a more extensive range than Cape York, despite the
remarks of “McNorth” (B. 3/7/T3). I’ve seen it
flashing in the scrubs near Gympie and in the thick
sub-tropical growths of Northern N.S.W. Other birds
of paradise are known only in Papua, Molucca and
islands off the coasts thereof. Protection notwith-
standing, they are still sold in Paris and other
places, to bedeck man’s pet savage. The male rifle-
bird is worth watching in the nesting season, when
he entertains his tart with dancing and acrobatic
turns for an hour at a stretch. I’ve a lot of tickets
on the rifle-bird; but he has strong rivals. The
regent bird, for instance. This yellow and black
beauty once resided nearly as. far south as Sydney,
but he and the missus and the kids were so ruth-
lessly shot and trapped before protection Was pro-
vided that I doubt if you’d now see one nearer the
South Pole than the Blackall Ranges (Q.). Regents are
mighty wary wherever they are, especially when the
lady is getting a few sticks together for the house.
She is a plain and dowdy dame, and far more diffi-
cult to detect than her brilliant husband. Which
gives him a great idea. “You better do the job,”
he says. “No good me dodging round after logs
and bricks and other timber. Somebody’d be sure to
see me and follow me home. And where’d you and
jour brat be then ? No ; I’ll lie low here and have
a yarn with Tom Tit. You get work!” And, being
a gentle, loving little thing, she gets it without com-
plaint. A pity there isn’t more like her—mentioning
no names, of course.
“Marranunga”: Though the average
Binghi of the North believes that death, swift,
sudden and relentless, will overtake him if he dares
to trespass against his tribe’s unwritten laws and
eat forbidden food, yet now and again a nigger can
be found slim enough to dodge all pains and
penalties. Recently I employed two bucks
Monkey, an old sinner who knew all the deviltries
possible; liun, a young buck, only lately circum-
cised, and, consequently, on a restricted diet. Mon-
key ate galahs, cockatoos, ibis, native companions
ducks and geese. Run lived on damper, and grew
hungrier at every meal. Finally, whep a particu-
larly juicy and fragrant turkey was handed to
Monkey, Run broke down altogether, and besought
Monkey, who was an elder of the tribe, to release
him from his vows. They conferred, and by-and-
bye both came over to me, Run with the light of a
new hope in his eyes, Monkey carrying the turkey.
“Boss, you puttit some feller turkey longa Run
mouth.” “What name?” I said. “You wantum Run
die, so you catchit allabout tucker longa you longa
him ?” “No more, boss,” replied Monkey. “Run
him new-feller man —s’pose him eatum turkey, him
quick-feller die. S’pose you givit longa him, him
no more die; you makum whitefeller tucker, good
feller tucker. All same damper, s’pose you give it.”
So Run squatted on his hunches in front of me, while
I stuffed the turkey down his throat. Seemingly the
theory was that while I forced the food on Run, he
could plead that he had not broken any tribal laws,
whereas, had he taken the food and eaten it from
his own hands, he would be guilty of a sin and
fall into the bottomless pit of iniquity.
"Norbell”: To do him justice, the bushy
doesn’t “chuck off” at the Englishman for his
habit of doing without a bathroom. He does with-
out one himself. Also he mostly does without a
“tub.” For months I have been touring out back
and staying in pubs—not first-class hotels at 10s.
and 12s. a day, but ordinary, ftve-bob-a-day pubs,
with an occasional boarding-house, and if all the
baths I found were made into one bath, it wouldn’t
float a sft. dinghy or a 30s. lOU. At Goondiwindi
(Q.) it was quite hot a couple of months ago, and
everyone was wearing white ducks. The boarding-
house I affected had no bathroom, but the boarders
never missed it. Every morning I went down to the
river Macintyre for a dip, and the unusual pro-
ceeding excited great local interest. As I set forth,
towel in hand, Goondiwindi stopped to stare at me
in wonder, and my fellow-boarders shivered, and
made derisive remarks when I returned. Even at
Toowoomba the bath was bone dry, and my daily
use of the shower excited much comment. At
Dalby I had to shift several sets of harness and a
perambulator before I could get into the bath. At
Mitchell and at Charleville they had no bathrooms
where I stayed. At Roma they were curing bacon
in the bathroom, so I went to the public swim-
mery, a very good one, with a fine supply of tepid
bore-water. I questioned the gloomy misanthrope
in charge. He told me he leased the baths from
the municipality and was losing money steadily.
“Sometimes, in the height of summer,” he said, “I
might take three quid a week. Look at them blokes
there,” and he pointed to an exciting football match
in progress near by. “Wouldn’t you think they’d
rush here for a dip, after all that dust an’ sweat?
Not much! They never come near!” If cleanli-
ness is next to godliness, I reckon Western Queens-
land’s chances of salvation are pretty dead.
* * * .
“Feray”: Binghi’s education moves with
the times. I had sent one of my darkies away with
the dray for a load of wood, and presently observed
him in the offing, vastly interested in a motor-ca
which had come to a standstill for some reason or
other not apparent to me. In the evening Binehi
returned in his cart, which contained only a couple
of sticks. “Why the Bottomless Pit didn’t you
bring a load when I told you to?” I said. “All right,
boss,” he replied easily; “that pfeller axe I took
along, him run hot I” I brained him on the spot.
HARD HITTING AND HARD LABOR.
After the Wells-Carpentier fight, the Belgian Par-
liament introduced a Bill punishing by fine or
imprisonment any bodily injury inflicted in a boxing
match.
THE CHICKALEARY COVE (winning on a
knock-out): “Here goes for 18 months
hardt!”
“Gouger” : No mug at catching fish is the
Peninsular nigger. His net is made exactly as is
his white brother’s, excepting that the strands are
composed of the twisted fibre of very strong bark.
Binghi stretches the net across a creek or river, and
it takes an exceedingly strong fish to break through
and escape. Spearing fish involves more skill and
patience. The spear ends in four iron-wire prongs,
sharpened and about Bin. long. The native stands
in a drifting canoe, spear poised, watching for the
slightest ripple that tells of a fish coming near the
surface. Different fish make different ripples, and
the native can tell instantly whether the ripple
stands for a desirable fish or not. If eatable, the
surprised submarine fowl finds himself transfixed by
a pronged skewer that is hurled with marvellous
accuracy.
COME OFF THE STUMP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Come off the stump, for Heaven’s sake,”
Old Bill the roadman cried.
The Swaggie who had stopped to take
A rest, in wrath replied:
“Come off the stump! I will, indeed,
If you can quote the lore
Wot shows wherein I do axceed
Me rights, and not afore!
“This road the king’s own ’ighway are,
And I defy” But Bill
The legal aspect scorned, afar,
And yelled his orders still.
“Come off the stump—-between your feet
There’s burning fuse, you chump
There’s dynamite beneath your seat,
You fool—come off the stump.”
The learned swagman quick forsook
The law, and forfeited
His rights—one flying leap he took
From off that stump and fled.

A famous London physician, who for years
made a study of this disease, has, after a number of
experiments, found a prescription which affords re-
lief in almost a marvellous manner. This has been
put on the market by Mr. I. W. Nicholl, Pharmaceu-

“Ozerine,” and the number of unsolicited testimonials
received speak well for its efficiency as a remedy
against this appalling disease. Your chemist can

In N. C. Lockyer the Interstate Commis-
sion has at least one whole-hearted Pro-
tectionist who holds very decided opinions
on the Trusts and Combines question. He
regards the Beef Trust as an established
fact in Australia, and has been watching its
tortuous operations for months past.
Thomas Hunter Griffith, who died last
week on his station, Weroona, 40 miles
from Albury (N.S.W.), was one of the best-
known of Riverina men. He represented
Albury in the State Parliament from 1898
to 1904, and was Mayor of Albury whenever
he pleased.
Died last week W. T. Mortlock, one of
the big sheep-men of S. Aus. Like his
friend and father-in-law, Andrew Tennant,
he dabbled in politics for a time, and talked
for the sand and salt-bush of the west and
north-west. Also, like Andrew Tennant,
he liked to have a few good horses in the
stable, and he was just about the most lib-
eral and most popular patron of country
races in the State.
“8.R.” : Mrs. Fiaschi, of Sydney, who
died last week, was a nun when she first
met her eminent doctor-husband. He was
one of the surgeons at the hospital where
she toiled. Their marriage maddened the
R.C. authorities at the time—the more so
as such vows as she had taken might have
been dispensed with by the Church if the
inevitability of the marriage had been
thoroughly impressed on that vast institution.
At any rate, that was what the Church said
on the subject afterwards. Fiaschi it never
really forgave. Witness the St. Vincent’s
Hospital episode of a few years back. His
wife, partly because she was such a good
and kindly woman, and partly because nuns
are for some reason the most broad-minded
and understanding of mortals, take them all
round, remained good friends to the end
with many of those who had shared her
convent life.

A placard about Melbourne notifies the
auctioning of “Elijah” Dowie’s old taber-
nacle in Johnstone-street, Collingwood.
Howie came from Sydney to Melbourne to
take temporary charge of Pastor Cherbury’s
Tabernacle in Sackville-street, Collingwood.
His doings and Dowie-ings did not please
Cherbury, so he was “relieved” of his job.
His frantic worshipners thereupon put up
the Johnstone-street Tabernacle as an oppo-
sition shop; but Cherbury got the custom.
Howie s tabernacle then fell to the Church
of Christ, and after that to the Salvation
Army.
H. Y. Braddon, just re-elected president
of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, is a
son of Edward Braddon, of the “Blot,” and
a nephew of Miss M. E. Braddon, who
wrote half a hundred novels. For some
time H. Y. Braddon was a banker in Tas-
mania and Maoriland. Then he joined
Dalgety and Co., at Newcastle, and rose to
be manager of that huge concern in Sydney.
His father, the Edward Braddon above-
mentioned, was a _ retired Indian civil ser-
vant who settled in Tasmania and entered
that Speck’s politics. He is still remem-
bered by reason of the fact that he woke up
the most somnolent old Speaker that ever
existed, even in Hobart. When, after a
multitude of efforts, he finally yelled at the
top of his voice, “Mr. Sleeper,” the Chair
partially sat up for nourishment, and said,
in a dazed sort of way. that the lion, mem-
ber for Thingumbob was in possession of
the eye of the House and could proceed to
do unlimited oration.
NO NEED
TO CHANGE
THE NAME.
It is mentioned in the smoking-room with-
out a quiver that H. D. Young, the newest
member of the S.A. Parliament, is the great-
grandson of an earl. His grandmother was
that Lady Charlotte Harley to whom Byron
dedicated the opening cantos of “Don Juan.”
bhe married General Bacon, and came out
to Adelaide in the early days. C. B. Young,
who married her daughter, was a pastoralist
and vigneron, and the present legislator still
runs the vineyard and makes very good
claret. He is one of the most silent mem-
jS House. He has sat for a year
and has only made three speeches. One was
three minutes long; another lasted five min-
utes ; the latest ran on for 18 minutes, helped
by interjections.
Ex-Salv’army Brigadier Bruntnell, who
represents Annandale in the N.S.W. Assem-
bly, has a very mixed brand of luck. In 1904
he started against the late E. W. O’Sullivan
for Belmore, and naturally ran a bad
second. Two years later John Norton tragi-
cally resigned the Sfirry Hills seat, and
Bruntnell got in through a badly split vote,
tsut Surry Hills was much too hot, of course
so at the general election he shifted to Alex-
andria. There the late State Treasurer J. Tt
Dacey bumped against him, and had no diffi-
culty in showing him how fields are won—
and lost. Last election he was returned for
Annandale with none too many votes to
spare, and next time he has to face Griffith.
Minister for Works. This at least should
prove a pretty hard try-out for him. By the
way, Bruntnell is not nearly so full of' sal-
vation as might be thought. “Briggy” has
even been seen smoking a cigar.
An Aged Inhabitant writes :
Thomas Curran, news of whose death was cabled
from London last week, made his very tidy fortune
m xew South Wales. He was originally a police-
man on the North Coast. He garnered in sufficient
hard cash to be able to take Pfahlert’s Hotel, in
Sydney. The daily papers, for some inexnlicable
reason, described him in their obituaries as “a suc-
cessful city merchant.” As a matter of cold fact,
he was a born hotelkeeper—a kind of super-land-
lord and nothing else. There was no more orderly,
respectable and comfortable house of call in Aus-
tralia than Pfahlert’s was under the Curran regime ;
and the best—in the sense of the wealthiest—people
flocked to it in shoals. Old Tom soon made a for-
tune, and the whole of his ambitions were centred
in his son. But the young man married an actress
—a very charming and worthy actress, but still a
member of a craft which the father had learned to
distrust profoundly in his dual rbles of John Dunn
and innkeeper. The guilty pair were solemnly
disinherited. Young Tom practised at the Bar in
Sydney for some years, and he is now pursuing the
elusive brief in London—or was when I last heard
of him. Both he and his father sat, as Nationalists
for Irish seats in the British Commons for some
years.
Dead, at 73, Edward White, son of James
White, father of the well-known N.S.W.
squatting family which included James
White, of Cranbrook (owner of Abercorn,
Cranbrook, and dozens of other speedy
mokes), and H. C. White, of Havilah, also
a racing enthusiast. A third brother is an
Anglican archdeacon. He doesn’t race, ex-
cept in the sense that when he and the Devil
are sprinting for a soul he shows a fair
turn of speed.
For a quiet, tea-drinking young man who
is still in the 40’s, Dave Hall, Premier Hol-
man’s close personal friend in the N.S.W.
Ministry, has suffered more changes than
most people. Dropping into the Public Ser-
vice, Hall, a shorthander of quality, was
made private sec. to the Minister for Lands.
Quitting that for politics, he studied law
along with Holman, the two of them getting
great help from Ferguson, now a Judge.
From the State House he passed to the
House of Reps. Holman, wanting help in
the Law Department, next enticed his friend
back, and had to fix him up with a seat in
the Leg. Council. Now the uneasy wan-
derer wqmts to go again to. the Assembly, so
he will be the Labor candidate for the new
Enmore seat.
“Caber”: The old politician, suddenly
turned down, takes his defeat in all kinds of
ways. There was the case of James Morgan.
In the Queensland elections of 1878,
this man, who had represented Warwick
for years, was lying in bed with
a broken leg when he received the
news of his defeat by Jacob Hor-
witz. In 48 hours James Morgan was
dead. But, again, I remember a case that
happened in 1893. when a bluff ex-Minister
was easily downed by a Labor man. Meet-
ing him the day after the election, I said I
was sorry at his defeat. “You’d be a
sight sorrier if you saw the ass that beat
me,” was the only answer I got. And he
turned the ass out of the stall at the first
opportunity.
“Orient” writes:—
The most interesting visitor in Melbourne at the
moment is Dr. Stuckey, head of the Pekin Medical
College. The antique saying was “Always something
fresh out of Africa.” Make it China now and hit
the bull’s-eye of truth. However well posted you
may be, the coming man is bound to instruct you.
“Smiler” Hales went twice through the heart of
China. The first time he found no interest taken in
militarism. The second time Young China would
talk of nothing else. Stuckey is also emphatic on
the intensity with which the Chinese study naval
and army questions. Under the Empire Australia
had no cause to fear. That Government was deter-
mined to keep the forces small. Now—well, any-
thing may happen. Everywhere and in everything
there is a rush of progress. And their capacity for
absorption is marvellous. Stuckey notes in particu-
lar that they have such memories as we cannot
imagine. They learn whole books off by heart. Thus
his students memorise the entire Materia Medica. In
this business of medicine they demand to be brought
right up to date ; hence Stuckey’s tour of Australian
hospitals. Soon, he seems to hint, the only Chinese
quacks in the world will be the few who practise on
the pockets of the credulous Australian.

Herbert Russell Elliston, the solicitor
who is. appearing for the Joneses (husband
and wife) committed on suspicion of mur-
dering one Mullins at Mathinna (Tas.), is a
descendant of Robert William Elliston. the
famous comedian of George lll.’s time. A
son of the comedian settled in Van Diemen’s
Land many years ago and raised a large
family. A grandson crossed the Straits
20-odd years ago, served articles with a
Melbourne solicitor, and then set up busi-
ness in Hobart. There is a lot of good,
profitable, exciting criminal law business to
be done in Tasmania, where the bucolic
feud flourishes and farmers slay one another
in cold blood.
“Lex”: Once more the rumor that Lord
Alverstone has resigned the Lord Chief
Justiceship of England proves false. A
cable message (15/8/T3) said he had done
that which his country expected of him;
the next morning another message contra-
dicted the first. He is 70 odd, and gravely
suspected of being somewhat amiss in the
head. Or, to put it more explicitly, the
American papers accuse him of being amiss
in the head. As a Judge he might be com-
pared to N.S.W.’s late Chief Justice Darley.
Like Darley, he was a comparatively indiffer-
ent lawyer ; like Darley he had prejudices and
a habit of unconsciously taking sides in any
given case; and also like Darley he had an
imposing figure, face and head; a most
urbane and courteous manner, and great
consideration for stupid or nervous people.
As Dick Webster he was, at Cambridge,
about the greatest long-distance runner and
all-round athlete of his day. Rufus Isaacs
has the best chance of succeeding him, de-
spite the Marconi unpleasantness. Had the
latter not occurred there would have been
no question of the brilliant Jew’s fitness
for the post. As things are the English
Bar, of which Isaacs is easily the most
popular member —a result of his charming
manners and kindly nature —and the Lib-
eral party will be almost equally enraged
if he is overlooked. To the Liberals such
an occurrence will seem like an endorse-
ment on the part of Asquith of the charges
that have been levelled at Isaacs. On the
other hand, the Conservatives will be bound
to work up a furious agitation in the coun-
try if Isaacs is appointed—an electioneering
disturbance reeking with insincere humbug
about the “purity of English public life.”
the wickedness of thrusting “Hebrew job-
bers” into high places, and so on. So far
as Isaacs is concerned, the persistent ad-
herence of Lord Alverstone to the Lord
Chief Justiceship amounts to a boon. If
the stubborn old man only hangs on for
another year or so there is a possibility of
the Marconi affair fading out of the public
mind so completely as to get beyond the
recall of Tory orators.

The profits, after moving up smartly for years, have
slipped back again ; but the margin over and above
the 6 p.c. div. is still wide. And the balance-sheet
figures show a decided improvement in one most
important respect. For a long while the Victoria
seemed to this paper to be lending more money than
it could afford to have out. Six months ago its hold-
ing of coin and liquid assets represented only 28
p.c. of its liabilities. Twelve months ago, with about
£2,175,000 owing on current account and to other
banks, it had in cash and semi-liquid assets only
£1,783,531. There was profit perhaps in doing
business that way, but there was a lot of risk. And
it is not certain that in the long run there was
profit either, because men with accounts that are
best worth having go to those banks which plainly
can see them through, not when money is plentiful
and easily got, but when it is tight. As might have
been expected, there was some reduction of deposits
during the year; but advances were called in so
strenuously, or they came in without being called,
that the liquid assets show a fine increase. Here

Thus 32 p.c. of all deposits and other liabilities are
now represented by liquid assets ; and the latter are
at last considerably in excess of the deposits on
current account. The change has given much extra
strength to the bank ; it is far better to see these
figures move the right way than it would be to find
the profits improved, but no improvement anywhere
else. Even 32 p.c. of liquid assets is none too
much; and a few points more would not be amiss.
But if the Victoria was weak in the matter of
coin and bullion, it was (and still is) stronger than
most of them in other respects. Its own funds in
the business are uncommonly substantial; for
every £1 of shareholders’ money there is only
£3 12s. of the public’s, and in Australia it is reck-
oned as a rule that a bank might take twice as
much as that and still feel comfortable. In Eng-
land the proportion runs still higher. It can be put
this way. The bank has £2,151,077 of cash and
liquid assets to forthwith meet £6,739,814 of lia-
bilities. Against the £4,588,737 of liabilities
which the liquid assets won’t meet, it has
£6,456,571 of other assets; and there is such a fine
margin for shrinkage there that depositors shouldn’t
lose any sleep at nights. On the other hand, the
comparatively small proportion of the public’s money
at risk means comparatively poor earnings on the
share capital. On capital and reserves combined
recent results show up as follows: —

The bank has the foundations for a much bigger busi-
ness. And, with careful management, it will no
doubt get what it wants. Ten years ago it had
£4,497,192 of deposits to trade with and make an
honest penny out of. To-day it has £6.424.143;
and if in 10 years from now it has another £2,000,000
it won’t have more than its own capital and re-
serves can very well stand.

Of the very substantial £6974 put bv for the half-
year, after paying the 10 p.c. div., £3500 goes to the
credit of a reserve for “renewals, etc., public risks
and contingencies.’’ If this was all that was pro-
vided against depreciation, it would have no right
to go in along with either the profits or the re-
serves ; for, if a sausage machine will last Only 10
years, one-tenth of the cost of the machine must be
deducted from the gross profit on the annual output
or crop of sausages. The wear and tear on the
machine is as much part of the cost of making the
sausage as the purchase-price of the mystery that
goes inside the skin. There was a time when it
looked as if this co. did not write off enough profits
to cover this wear and tear ; and, after a few years,
the shortage had to be made good by writing off
capital. Of late years, however, a safer policy has
been pursued, and depreciation has been charged up
along with other working exes. In other words, the
profits disclosed appear to be real profits. In fact,
the business may be even better than would be judged
from that first table. Take this comparison, for
instance:—

Surplus .. £1,596 £79,369 £79,007 £87,396
In 10 years £85,800 has thus been accumulated in
liquid or semi-liquid assets. At present these assets
include £46,585 in cash and deposits arid £20,732
in public securities; the balance consists of book
debts and stock. So, in 10 years, the co. has out
of profits (1) paid dividends ranging from 6 to 12
P-c., (2) maintained and extended its plant, and
(3) accumulated £85,800 in cash, etc. Assuming 1
that the plant, freeholds, etc., are worth to-day what
they were 10 years ago (and that seems a very safe
assumption), the result is exceptionally fine. And
the past year’s figures have been well up to the
average; for while the surplus of liquid and semi-
liquid assets has grown by £8027, the outlay on
fixed assets, is known to have been very considerable.
Among other things the ice-making plant has been
much enlarged. This has been a fine branch of the
business during the past few years, thanks very
largely to an honorable understanding in the trade.

The capital is now £300,000, whereas 10 years ago
it was only £131,250 ; and the gradual increase has
to be remembered when the eve runs down the
figures relating to profits. The 8 p.c. dividend was
restored in 1904 after a spell of smaller payments ;
and after it is paid there is perhaps really less left
° , now t ha n there was seven years ago. The
u 7 •!' Coast is certainly rich cow-country,
but its trade is carried on under difficulties. Mostly
the ships have to poke in and out of so-called bar
harbors When the ships bump harder than usual
on the bar there is a wreck. At other times, when
the skipper won t risk a bump, he has to squat in-
side, it may be for weeks, till the bar shifts or the
Government casually digs him out. It is a per-
petua, grievance with the co. that the State does so
nttle for the Northern harbors; and it is likely to
go on being a grievance. For, though some day
there will be a real port at Coff’s or thereabouts,
the extension of railways will make the Government
less inclined than ever to pour out money continu-
ally on half a dozen harbors in close proximity to
one another. J
As the North Coast has been opened up and the
cow has become more numerous in the land, the co
has got in more money, and put it into more numer-
ous and better ships. This shows the progress:

The directors have an idea that they have now
enough ships for a while; so the liabilities will pro-
bably be wiped out as profits are accumulated and
put to the credit of a depreciation account. There

apart from this. Whether the co. is making more
real profits than it discloses and is stuffing them
away somewhere—that is to say, is writing off more
than the depreciation actually amounts to—The
Bulletin doesn’t know. But this doesn’t seem to

And, though it has a solid business, it doesn’t ap-

During the half-year this co., having brought its
capital up to £lOO,OOO in £1 shares, obtained
power to issue another 100,000 shares * and 23 230
of them were sent to market straight away at a pre-
mium of 2s. 6d. This aipount has been added as
usual, to reserves. On the new issue of shares only
2s. 6d. has so far been paid-in addition, of course
to the premium. The co. has a long, sober record, and
judged by any test that can be applied, it has been
steadily improving its position. Certainly one has
to take a lot on trust. Apart from the co.’s pre-
mises (freehold and leasehold), valued at £26,506
very nearly all the assets are tied into one
Advances on mortgages, pledges and other securi-
ties and other assets, £136,958.” Whether this lot
» w , orth £116,958 or £136.958 or £156,958 is
largely a matter of opinion. But, as said just now,
the co. has had a long life of steady prosperity, and
as much the same people are in charge now as have
been in charge for years past, it is a fair thing to
accept the valuations as being on the safe side.
Moreover, the co. makes its fine profits out of its
°' vn capital mostly; all the outside money it has in
the business is now £17,334. The risk comes in
when you advance money; and when you advance
£1 of somebody else’s money as well as £1 of your
own, your risk is twice as great as when you advance
only your own sovereign. The co.’s profit is therefore
all the finer for being made out of its own sovereign.
Apparently there is no lack of borrowers. When times
are bad people borrow because they want the money,
and when times are good they borrow because they
want to gamble with the money. The advances, etc.,
as shown just now, were £136,958 as at June 30,
1913. Twelve months ago they were £119,811.
Two years before that they were £102,991. At
June, 1903, when things were pretty bad in Sydney,
the total was £87,244. The habit of having an
uncle doesn’t therefore seem to be dying out. No
part of the capital is represented by goodwill or
other doubtful assets of that sort; and altogether,
accepting the valuations as sound, the security is
good and the profits are even better.

This co. has been having a “silver jubilee,” and
hands out a birthday bonus of 5 p.c. to its share-
holders and 10 p.c. to the staff. The staff’s bonus
( £478) has been deducted from profits, of course,
in the foregoing table. Denny Day, now the G.M.
of the Royal Bank of Queensland, was the first
manager; but, good man though he was for the
job, so much ink was used up in writing and print-
ing the name of the concern—it was in
those days the Queensland Permanent Trustee,
Executor, and Finance Co., Ltd.—that the share-
holders got no dividend for six years, and then it
was only a modest p.c. to start with. When the
infant became a 10-year-old 4 p.c. was paid; and
from that the bite was gradually increased
to the present 10 p.c. If the bite had been in-
creased with less rapidity this paper wouldn’t have
complained. Still, there is this to be said: the
co. has put the bulk of its funds into such gilt-
edged securities that serious depreciation, is very
improbable, wherefore there isn’t such an urgent
call for a big reserve fund to protect the capital as
there would otherwise be. As at June 30 the capital
was £25,250, and after providing for all liabilities
except the current dividend and bonus, there was
£31,459 in various Government securities and bank
deposits, and another £12,000 or so was repre-
sented by secured loans and unspecified investments.
As might be expected from the fact that there is
only one other co. competing generally for the
trustee business of Queensland, this co.’s figures
grow steadily. Seven years ago the value of the
estates in hand was £1,408,236; to-day it is
£2,874,938, or more than twice as much. And,
given good management, it seems bound to grow;
for even no* only one-eighth in value of the local
estates that some body must administer are passed
to this co. for administration. But that doesn’t
represent the probable future percentage of clients.
For instance, there were seven directors when this co
started 25 years ago, and four of them are
still alive and administering their own affairs. The
next year, perhaps, it persuaded 50 people that it
was better to have their trustee work done by a co
which made a regular job of the business
than by somebody who only undertook it as a side-
line; but the chances are that 30 of them are still
keeping alive and cheating the co. out of its com-
missions. A trustee co. is thus essentially one
which has to wait very many days before the' bread
cast on the waters comes back with a customer. No
doubt the time will come when the estates
finally disposed of will be nearly equal to the
estates coming in fresh ; but that time looks a con-
siderable distance ahead yet. Meantime, to pre-
vent disappointment, it is just as well to remember
that the co. works on a commission basis, and
that, when capital and annual values ease—as they
are pretty certain to do in Queensland before long
the earnings won’t be so cheerful as they have
been unless the estates in hand increase very
considerably.

It is explained that the past year’s profits have been
affected by high prices for material, shrinkage of
trade in the mining districts and the closing of
hotels by the Licenses Reduction Board. It is a
very solid business this closing of hotels in Vic-
toria. In the Castlemaine licensing district there
were 49 pubs when the guillotine fell in Dec., 1906,
and of that 49 no less than 37 had to go. Accord-
ing to the last count 17 have gone, and the other
20 will go gradually as the licensees and the land-
lords supply tDa compensation money between them.
The owner h£,s to hand over £2 on every £lOO of
liquor-purchases and the tenant £l, and this forms
the fund out of which the Board pays the compensa-
tion. The latter was fixed in 1906 on the results
of the previous three years’ trading. Fortunately for
the brewer, the Australian thirst doesn’t shrink in
proportion to the number of pubs. That much can
be said for certain, even though the statistics re-
garding the consumption of alcohol in Australia are
very poor.' For the separate States, indeed, none at
all are now available. In Victoria the consumption
of beer fell from 1545 gallons per 100 people in 1885 to
1192 gallons in 1909 ; and with that year the State
statistics ended. For the whole of Australia, Knibbs
says the consumption in 1911 was 1237 gallons per 100 •
so the Victorian figures for that year, if they could be
separated, would probably show a still further reduc-
tion. If the closing of pubs isn’t going to do what
the Cold Tea nartv expects, the evidence available
thus shows that it isn’t going to do any good to the
brewers. Nevertheless the legislation has this effect:
it sends the weaker and more nervous ones out of
the business and shooes off possible competitors. The
only serious brewing concern started in Australia
during the past 10 years, when money has been
at times very plentiful, has been on a co-operative
basis. And quite likely there will be more of this
in the future, because it seems likely that the more
you reduce pubs, and the more you thus concentrate
the beer-selling business in a few hands, the easier
will it be to promote and run co-operative beer-
factories. It’s another risk, anyhow, with brewerv in
vestments nowadays. y
This Fitzgerald’s Co., of Castlemaine, is a verv
solid, steady-going old concern, which didn’t lose it*
head at the time of the great beer-fight, and didn’t
pay prodigious prices to get command of beer
engines. In 1900 it had only £15,050 in pub wo
perties. Since then, as it has had accumulated nro-
hts to invest, and as money formerly out on mort-
gage has come in, it has bought a few more and
now the item stands at £40,653. A while ago the
local Standard Brewery was absorbed, and this drove
the co. to the bank for an overdraft; but the total
liabilities are now only £6785. The reserves are nor
large; but as the table shows, they have been drawn
upon to water the capital. In fact, capital has been
so copiously watered that the 10 p.c. div demand
a inT° f r, h u net proflt this Tear except a poor little
£97. that certainly doesn’t look any too promising
for the maintenance of a 10 p.c. ’ div. in bad years
Apart from that, the position is exceptionally solid
—so far as any co.’s position can be solid in this
always-threatened business.

The Federal Mutual Insurance Co. of
Australia. —Early last year W. R. Dimond, N S
Wales manager of one of the oldest and wealthiest
foreign insurance cos., decided finally that Aus-
tralia needed t)ie money that he was helping to
send out of the country. He, therefore, resigned
and in due course formed this Federal Mutual Co’
He got in quite as much coin as he wanted —more
in fact, than was necessary; present capital is
£35,776, and the whole of that, less flotation ex-
penses, is represented by solid assets, for there were
no promoters shares. The co. thus made a first-
rate start with a clean balance-sheet and a manager
who had confidence enough in himself and in Aus-
tralia to throw up a good office and put himself
and his money into the new venture. There was a
pretty good guarantee there, too, that the co
wouldn't go in for fireworks. Expansion is, no
doubt, a very fine thing ; but, as a rule, it has to be
given to fire-insurance infants in strict moderation
The Australian experience has been just the same as
the American in this respect; and as to that the
Independent (N’York) pointed out the other week
that almost every successful U.S. fire office had
started off as a small, or comparatively small, local
concern, and had pushed out gradually. The Fed-
eral’s first balance-sheet appears to show that this
policy is its policy. The year’s net premiums (to
June 30) were £11,621. Expenses were £7334,
claims £1989; underwriting surplus (The Bul-
letin hesitates to call it profit), £2298. The ex-
pense .rate is thus 63.1 p.c.—much more, of course
than it ought to be if this were the 10th year of
the co.’s life, but distinctly moderate for a first
year. And, assuming that the policies have come
in in a fairly regular flow during the year, the loss
rate shows reasonably careful selection of risks. It
has been reckoned that it is a fair thing to assume
that at the end of a co.’s first year the risks have
run, on the average, five months. If that arbitrary
rule holds in this case the losses to be properly
charged against the year’s premiums would be
£4773, and the loss rate would be 40 p.c. Even
then a profit of £642 would be shown on the year’s
transactions, because, in addition to the underwrit-
ing surplus mentioned above, interest and other
earnings were £ll2B. The first year’s results, re-
garding them in the strictest way, may, therefore,
be regarded as thoroughly satisfactory. What is
wanted now is more business ; and there should be
plenty waiting.
It may be safely said that nine Australian people
out of 10 believe that, other things being equal, it
is better to give Australian insurance business to
Australian insurance offices, so that, if there are
profits, Australia may have them. The other tenth
may be infatuated enough to suppose that they, in
common with the rest of Australia, will grow fat by
always passing their meals on to their neighbors.
The only things which it should be necessary to
prove to the sane nine-tenths are that (1) Australian
premiums are as low, (2) their settlements as liberal,
and (3) their security as good as the foreigners’.
(1) As for premiums, the tariff governs that; there
is no undercutting in this business. They are all
good unionists, and J. Cook couldn’t do anything
else but give preference to a union fire-insurance co.
if he tried. (2) The Australian office, with its direc-
tors on the spot, and with its hopes of salvation
centred wholly in Australia, is more likely to make
liberal settlements than a concern whose Australian
business is perhaps 1 per cent, of the lot. The small
customer doesn’t usually get preferential treatment.
(3) This co.’s solid net funds as at June 30 were
£35,000, which is equal to 301 p.c. of the year’s net
premium income; and this is a position nearly twice
as strong as that of the leading British cos., aver-
aging their risks and funds. The one questionable
thing done has been to put £23,250 into mort-
gages. Mortgages may be as good almost as gold—
or as poor as Lazarus was once alleged to be. Since
this co. needs business, and since it can best get
business by showing that it has the stuff to pay
claims, even though they should be five times as
heavy as could reasonably be expected, it was a
pity, for the sake of an extra few shillings per
cent., to put the bulk of the capital into mortgages
instead of fixed deposits or funded stock.
Dennys, Lascelles. Ltd.—ln 1557 the
late O. .1. Dennys started business as a general agent in
Geelong, and in 1868 E. H. Lascelles joined him;
and that was the start of the firm that has become
better known than any other in the Western district
O; Victoria. Various partners have come and gone
since 1868 ; in fact, so many have gone that a while
ago Mr. Lascelles found himself alone in the con-
cern. Then, after 50 years’ total service and 35
years as managing director, he decided that it was
about a fair thing to share the profits and the risks
and the burdens with other people, and in March of
last year a prospectus was issued. In its fullness
and frankness and fairness the document did the old
man credit. Altogether 150,000 £1 shares were
issued- The public took 100,000, and the vendor
50,000 for goodwill. The wool warehouse and the
book debts, etc., were to be paid for in cash; but
the wnrehousc property had, it seems certain, been
written down to below present value, and the vendor
guaranteed every penny of the book debts. More-
over, he guaranteed a 7 p.c. div. for five vears. Thus,
though the price charged for goodwill was stiff, it
y? a ® v i° P a /d in scrip ; and the vendor showed
that he thought it was worth the price by guarantee-
ing the div. on the whole of the capital. The aver-
S or P rec eding six years had been
£13,198, and the co. needs only £10,500 to pay
uara nteed div. ; nevertheless for one reason and
another, but no doubt chiefly because of last year’s
drought and the shrinkage of the wool clip, the
first year s nrofit under the co.’s control was only
£ 9863 ; and £353 was written off that towards
wiping out flotation exes, in five vears. The vendor
therefore has to part up £990, and thus sharehold-
ers get their 7 p.c. But they can’t get more than
7 p.c., it seems, for five years. If the profits next
year are more than enough to pay the 7 p.c., the
excess will be refunded to the vendor to the extent
ox last year’s deficit; and any further excess will be
hoarded un and applied at the end of five years to
the reduction of goodwill. On the whole, assuming
that the next few years will be much the same as
the last few (and the next few probably won’t be
any better in most businesses, and most likely will
bo Dot so Rood), there won’t be much profit in excess
of 7 p.c. It is true the average profits for six years
were £13,198; but no charge was made against
that for management by partners in the business, and
the managing director now draws £l5OO, and there
are three other directors to help him. When vou
deduct, say, £2OOO on this account from £13,198,
there will not be much to lav bv after paviner the
£10,500 which the 7 p.c. dividend will call for.

The weak feature in this case is that the co. owes a
heap of money, and either this borrowed money or
the capital (it doesn’t matter which) is sunk in'pro-
perty that doesn’t appear to be bringing in much
of a* return. Take this analysis of the accounts to

The hotels, properties, etc., include the Cascade
estate —a big lump of mostly-vacant and almost un-
productive land just outside Hobart. In fact, there
must be so much money locked up in this holding
that the co. can’t be regarded as an ordinary brewery
concern at all. It is deeply interested, of course, in
beer, and hopes to be deeply interested in cider pre-
sently ; but it also waits patiently for people to come
in and relieve it of some of its numerous acres.
Some day, perhaps, when Tasmania wakes up and
Hobart gets as much shipping as the fine harbor de-
serves, this land may bring in a handsome profit.
Meantime it looks as though the profit on the beer
has to pay a good deal of unearned interest on the
property. In addition to the Cascade estate the co.
is understood to have a considerable holding of pubs ;
and it isn’t clear whether enough is being written
off these to balance the depreciation. In fact, the
number of things not disclosed in these accounts
would make a fair amount of reading for a quiet
Sabbath afternoon. Judging by the figures, profits
are improving, but, considering the big sum of out-
side money risked in the business, the lay-by is still
small, and the reserves are not what they should be.
Fairfax and Roberts, Ltd. (Sydney),
formed to take over an old-established jewellery busi-
ness as from June, 1911, began with a deficit of

ary exes.—

Probably the capital not represented by tangible
assets at the outset was more than £15,588. The
co. does not own any freehold, but has a long lease
of premises in Hunter-street, Sydney, and the co.
took this over at £17,000. Apart from that asset,
which is at the very best a wasting one, £777 had
been put into buiiding improvements. The right
course is being adopted with regard to both of these
items. To replace the wasting leasehold asset, the
directors are charging gross profits with £330 p.a.
and are paying it in cash into an amortization fund,
apparently with the object of investing it later on
in freehold. As for the building improvements, the
book value is being written off rapidly out of profits.
In the table the amounts thus written off have been
deducted from the profits; and as the amount writ-
ten off last year ( £322) was greater than in the
co.’s first year, last year’s net profits suffer a little
by comparison. The co. is working practically alto-
gether on its own capital (pref., £20,000; ordinary,
£65,000). Liabilities of all kinds on June 30 were
only £3906. Apart from goodwill, leaseholds and
other intangible assets, the co. s possessions as at
that date were £59,931 net, equal to £1 per share
for the prefs. and 12s. 3d. for the ordinaries. The
co. has thus a good way to go before the profits can
fully replace the paper assets which now figure
pretty largely in the accounts. The latter, by the
way, are presented in an exceptionally lucid
The indefatigable Mr. Young, “certified
geologist,” prattles still of the Southern Cross, though
the Ardlethan boom is dead as Captain Cook. the
lode material consists of decomposed kaolin, por-
phyry, contact rock consisting of chlontic schist and
iron. .. .The ore in the No. 3 shaft is very fair grade.
... .and in No. 4 shaft ore of very high grade is being
won.” Finally the incurable optimist, after talking
thus of lodes and very high-erade ore, is still hopeful
that before long good bodies of ore will be dis-
closed.” The people who paid 7s. a share are pr°b-
ablv “still hopeful” too. The same Mr. Young says
of the Drumlish Hill: “The manager hopes the ore
in this shaft may be of a higher grade than that ol
the other shafts. .. .About 200 tons of ore are at
grass, averaging, I should think, 5 p.c. The ™
lous hopes of the manager, and the tonnage
(“about”), and the “averaging, IfffiouM think, are
the old methods of the Southern Cross, but they are
not the methods of reputable mining fields. #
Great Fitzroy’s report for the 13 months
to the end of May must give shareholders cold
shivers. As a result of the reconstruction in April
of last year, shareholders were called upo P<
up another £56,250 in order to give
the mine another chance. Rotten though P’ , b | e
was, they responded to the call with _ to
fidelity, and paid in £54,531 cash. Tin? was to
the end of May. By June 5 another £lO,lBl had
been raked in, making £64,712 for the cause But
it was mostly the debenture-holders cause, for out
of that the debenture-holders bit the t]r ] . ,t . t i ®
morsel of £43.800. They hadn’t a chance of getting
it any other way; hence the reconstruction. The
co.’s position now is that of the £BO.OOO A
debentures with which it was loaded, year
only £36,200—a pretty fair quittance for one .
This £36,200 falls due in a u ” le of . ano ther

g of its copper sales, but the Mount Morgan report
tor much the same period will give a pretty good
n just on A; 76. The cost of production, as
snown in the working account, was almost £B5.
ihis is exclusive of realisation, or any charges for
administration, debenture interest, etc. If realisation
cost (say) £7 lOs. per ton of copper, the year's
total expenses were equal to about £97 10s. per ton
of copper a staggering figure. Each ton of copper
contained £23 10s. of gold and silver. So if copper
had averaged less than £74, a loss would have re-
sulted. r lhe profit of £1099 is not impressive, ex-
cept as a warning. And half of it goes to the de-
benture-holder, leaving £ 549 to begin the current
year with. The Laloki mine, in Papua, has a
big contract ahead of it to pull this unfortunate co.
out of its slough. The one bright feature is the
way this mine is developing. If the co. goes bung,
Mount Morgan, which once turned the chance down,
would rush the Laloki.

Mammoth, the N.Q. copper show in which
Glasgow people ■ are so far chiefly interested, is
undergoing some changes. Vivian, hitherto manager,
is retiring, and Audley Smith takes the oversight of
the property, with Rutledge as manager on the spot.
Rutledge, a young Queenslander, did first-rate work
under Audley Smith when the latter was sent some
time ago to clean up a mess that a French copper
co. had made in New Caledonia.

Corbould, who put Mount Elliott on the
way to dividends, is either to be asked or has been
asked to take the job of consulting engineer to
Mount Oxide (N.Q.). The new co. took possession a
few days ago.
Mount Oxide is apparently not the only
show in the N.Q. district where the creeks are
nearly all explosive—Torpedo, Gunpowder, Lyddite
and so on. The Oxide Creek claim is reported to
have cut 18ft. of 35 p.c. ore at 200 ft.
New Brilliant Freehold, Charters Towers,
has had a good winze development below No. 5
level, and shares have been sold at over Bs. on the
local market. As this make is near Mills’ United’s
boundary, that co.’s shares are also in better favor.
For the first six months of this year the Freehold
crushed 7008 tons for £18,584. Mills’ United
crushed 7001 tons for £17,320. The Freehold paid
a dividend of 6d. ( £3750) and carries a good credit
balance. Mills’ United has been doing expensive
prospecting below No. 14 level, and shareholders
have got nothing; but the market would quickly
respond if an extensive shoot of payable ore were
opened near the boundary.
Charters Towers is astounded at the
Queensland Mines Department’s refusal to hand out
£6OOO towards sinking a 4000 ft. shaft inLissner Park.
The Towers has produced over £26,000,000 in gold
and paid £6,500,000 in dividends; but its best
mines—Brilliant P.C., Day Dawn P.C., Day Dawn
Block and Wyndham, Mills’ United and Queen Cross
—are all cither in low water or on the rocks.
Shallow levels have been ransacked, so deep sinking
on the dip of the Day Dawn or Brilliant formations
is the best hope. Face prospects at the bottom of
the deepest shafts (on the underlay) are generally
poor, but it is characteristic of this field that a
payable zone of country is often sandwiched between
barren or very lightly mineralised stone. Thus Mills’
United, on the eastern Day Dawn shoot, was at its
best between Nos. 5 and 10; above N 0.5 and below
No. 10 values were of little account.
Blair Athol, near Clermont (Q.), pro-
duced 7934 tons of coal in April, 7755 tons in May,
and 7197 tons in June, making 22,886 for the quar-
ter. A sixpenny dividend was recently declared on
the 100,000 shares. In view of th" isolation of this
colliery, profits and dividends cannot be expected
to rapidly increase, unless some big industrial enter-
prise can be attracted to the neighborhood. The
kind of competition that a little isolated colliery is
exposed to, if it aspires to ship its coal, will be
understood from the fact that the Caledonian Col-
lieries (N.S.W.) turned out 63,393 tons of coal in
a recent fortnight.

A lot of the old ground at the Lawlers
and Mount Sir Samuel end of the East Murchison
field (W.A.) is being gone over again by working
parties. Some are fossicking at and near what used
to be the Northern Co.’s ground, others are pros-
pecting at the Vivien and Waroonga ; others, again,
are trying to turn Kathleen Valley and Bellevue to
profitable account. The best find has been made near
the Bellevue, where high-grade stone has been found
close to the surface; but in quite a number of other
places gold is being dug up in at least payable quan-
tities. Nearly half a million ounces of gold were
won from this part of the field by London cos., but
not one penny of it ever got into shareholders ,
pockets. It all went, together with probably another
half a million of subscribed capital, in development,
equipment, wages, salaries, fees, horse feed, etc. ,
and when poor or refractory zones were struck and no
more funds could be got, operations ceased. #

Chaffers’ accounts to December 31 show
that £7500 of cash was then left, but the credit
balance has probably been used up since then. The
npw assessment of Is. 6d. per share will give the
co something over £40,000 net wherewith to do
add-' nal development, increase the capacity of the

for— gencies. Whether these things will produce
divitl-nds is still doubtful. #

winder. It is intended to crosscut for the reef when
a depth of 150 ft. is reached. The purchase of the
Myrtle Central lease for 7200 of the co. s shares is
regarded as a certainty Edna May South is shaft-
sinking on the Myrtle East option, and threatens to
do a lot of development before deciding whether it
will buy or not... .Marvel Loch Co. has now settled
down on the Comet lease. This show is being devel-
oped in the way that will enable the greatest possible
tonnage to be raised and treated during the next
couple of months. After that, look out!
Models of fourteen of the biggest nuggets
yet found in the West have been sent to Genoa to
gild-edge a display of mineral wealtn about to be
exhibited there. The collection includes the Bobby
Dazzler (4130 z.) and General Gordon (3310 z.), found
iu the same claim near Marble Bar ; the Little Hero
(3330 z.), unearthed by a Pilbarra dryblower named
Hoyle; the Kurnalpi (168 oz.), picked up by Sim-
mons and party; tne Coolgardie, discovered by Ab-
bott; the Ruby Well, found at Ruby Well; and one
of 1650 z. which came from Friendly Creek, Pilbarra.

Associated Northerns (W.A.) have
started to sag. Last month's profit from ore treat-
ment amounted to only £319, and the co. is stated
to have been driven to underhand stoping on the rich
shoot below No. 4 level in order to get this result.
If that is so, there isn’t much to look forward to, and
dividends are not likely to be maintained. Without
the rich shoot, the average for the mine was esti-
mated at about £1 per ton, but as the grade last
month, with sweeteners from the shoot, was only a
shade over 18s., it would be interesting to know what
the present average, apart from the rich lens, really
is.
Hamilton, of the Boulder, has been tour-
ing the Murchison (W.A.) in search of something
else for his co. Several shows were glanced at, but
nothing anywhere up to the required standard was
seen. Politicians and other light-headed persons are
continually remarking that there are plenty other
Golden Miles in the West, but when some expert like
Hamilton starts out to look for something big the
other Golden Miles hide themselves. As regards the
Boulder’s present property, its value is slowly shrink-
ing. Below 2500 ft. there is apparently nothing, and
very little between that level and 2200 ft. Above the
latter point there is, as Hamilton recently estimated,
the present price of the shares in dividends.

Mount Lyell is the last big property to
see virtues in the flotation process as applied to low-
grade ore. Waterhouse, a young Sydney metallurgist,
who has been through the mill at Broken Hill, has
been engaged to do the necessary preliminaries.
* * * *
Mount Bischoff (Tas.) has been able to
continue its monthly 10s. div. ; but as 10s. a month
means £36,000 a half-year, and as last half-year’s
profit was only £41,631, the 10s. a month seems
precarious. Yet it will have to be continued for 10
years to overhaul the market valuation of £6O per
share. Bischoff builds its prosperity on low costs.
Last half-year they averaged a trifle under ss. per
ton of crude stuff for the 106,063 tons handled.
These costs may be kept where they are. The more
serious question is: Can the tin market be kept
where it is?
* * * *
Johnson’s Reef, Harrietville (Vic.), is no
youngster, for it dates back to the days of the New
Options, an English trifler that didn’t stop long
enough in the mountains to learn the tortuous ways
of the shoots there. To find out if the horizontal
makes of stone had been cut off by faulting, the
present co. tunnelled in 480 ft., and from a crosscut
rose and cut a reef sft. thick. Then a winze from
the old workings went through a reef 7 ft. thick, and
at the bottom the reef is being opened up north and
south on kindly stone. All this may seem a bit of
a tangle, but the topsy-turvy way in which the
makes of quartz have been displaced means zigzag-
ging work. Otherwise, conditions are ideal for cheap
handling, so the talk is of dividends coming from
4dwt. stone. There isn’t to-day a decent reefing
mine round Bright and Harrietville to reward some
of the hardest prospecting done in the State. The
Johnson’s big body of stone, that carries into unex-
plored country, may mean a much-needed change in
the luck of the locality.
A snag lurks somewhere about Central
Cathcart, Ararat (Vic.), and a good deal of groping
is being done to locate it. The non-declaration ot
the fathoms gave a nasty impression when the last
fortnightly yield came out, and helped the cause ot
the dealers who were short of a few shares. True,
other alluvial mines in Victoria don’t tell their
fathoms, either; but then most of the other shows
have also got smelly reputations. What didn’t look
well with the Central was to suddenly leave off
mentioning the fathoms after it had made a splash
over the £?oz. yields. Since then, of course, it has
been given out that the bit of work done down the
gutter yielded 40oz. from 13 fathoms. Following
that it was whispered that the yield was better than
the truck samples. Who gets the results of the truck
samples? It is important, for in them is the key
to the mine’s position. If there really is no truck
sampling, the management had better clear up the
point as fast as it can. Anyway, if it is thought
the right thing to let out news that 13 fathoms
gave 400 z., it no doubt will be thought proper in
the future to announce that 13 trucks went
whenever such a yield happens along.
The gamble in South German. Maldon
(Vic.), is based on sentiment rather than sense.
The mine was a poor show to 600 ft. Thence to
1700 ft. it showed as sweet a shoot of gold as existed
in Victoria. Below 1700 ft. a floor shunted the
shoot of gold to parts unknown. The past eight
years have been devoted to sweeping down stopes,
making calls and keeping up the pecker of the
shareholder. When the shareholder was as tired as
a worn-out Victorian locomotive, a party of tnbutors
hit on a patch of decent stone below 1700 ft. m the
old make. The co. promptly shooed off other would-be
tribute parties, and set to drive an intermediate
level below the tribute block. The little fact that
beneath this intermediate working lies the 2000 ft.
level, and that it didn’t disclose anything, has been
mostly overlooked. So the market has bounced up
and down according to the news that has dribbled to
it. The Bulletin doesn’t believe that the Baxters
tribute ground is more than a patch. It won t
admit, either, that any South German work at
1900 ft. is likely to upset the results of half a cen-
tury’s mining at Maldon, and the most important of
those results is that there has never been a show
worth the name after the 1 / 50ft. level has been
passed.

ground and’ the estimate of costs, it is quite easy
to work out what profit there is at various tin prices.
At £2OO, a monthly output of 81 tons of tin oxide
(from 150,000 yards, the work oi two dredges)
would produce from £6500 to £7OOO profit. For
every £lO fall in metallic tin, £570 must be
knocked off that. Thus the price of tin would have
to fall to below £BO to make the proposition unprofit-
able. That is how it works out. The figures as to
costs may be wrong, though neither they nor any of the
others look wrong; but even allowing large margins
for errors, the price asked for the property is small,
and the prospects are very rosy. The Austral-Malav
Trust, which is the vendor, takes 80,000 out of
130,000 share': also, it takes £9OOO cash, and the
other avail.it.£4l,ooo will, it is expected, provide
the necessary dredges.

Then the “big” money that Bull Cohen is alleged to
pay the miner has to be heavily discounted. A
miner who contracts to break out a certain bit of
reef has to employ and pay a couple of white assist-
ants and a gang of niggers ; he has to pay the co.,
too, for use of mine machinery, and buy from it his
light, his fracteur—in fact, everything he needs —or
he gets into trouble, and is passed out on any pre-
text. If he has taken the job at a “cut” rate, his
balance looks wretched at the end of the month
when the co. tenders its contra. If it so happens
that he is ,on the wrong side of the ledger, the co.
can, and does, follow him to his next contract, and
claim payment before he handles a penny of the
money he has earned. And if he gets annoyed and
goes on strike, the co. uses its influence to have
troops called out to shoot him down.

LETTER
Sydney, Aui-ect 18, 1913.
My Dear Arini, —
The British Parliament \ party is
steaming nearer to this coi. ~ which it
should greet on September 2. of its
original members have revoke.: . r gone
“no trumps” on a hopeless han.l. i some-
thing, and stuck fast in the 1 eg. The
Calthorpes are not coming, and a slight
haze still clouds the whereabouts of some
other official Bullites. On this side a pro-
gramme of fearsome size is already nailed
together for the benefit of those who drop
their Saratogas on the feet <sf our best-
tipped tavern porters. September 3 will
see the overseas’ legislators and their femi-
nine belongings sliced into three sections.
The first section will be captured for a
wild rush to the Blue Mountains. Lithgow,
with its small-arms factory and other war-
like accoutrements, will be the objective of
this visit. Later in the day, when the vis-
itors have bolted their midday ham and
chicken, and scraped the coal' dust out of
their eyes, they will bustle off to Katoomba
to examine the scenery and note the depths
of gullies, and the heights of mountains,
and the extent to which you can drop if you
roll over the edge in your sleep. This con-
tingent expects to arrive in Sydney with all
its arms and legs intact, in time for
Governor Strickland’s ball.
Section two will petrol through country
dust to sample the cabbages, pigs, spring
chickens and agricultural implements at
Hawkesbury College. A third division of
the great official picnic party will be offered
the serious dissipation of inspecting bottled
science at Sydney Uni., the Tech. College
and other haunts of knowledge. These, I
imagine, will include the veterans of the
show who are not looking for breathless ex-
cursions over pumpkins in the raw.
On September 4 (if every arrangement
forecasted by the N.S.W. Tourist Bureau
isn’t half-soled and heeled to meet unfore-
seen emergencies) the Parliamentarians
fall back on Exodus. They fly almost due
north. At Newcastle, John Bull, M.P., will
examine the local coal supoly and spend
most of his day (when not saying grace or
returning thanks) trying to diagnose the
strike germ. On the following date the
party puts on its motor goggles, bags its
heads, and races from Tenterfield to Lis-
more in rubber-tyred chariots. This little
jaunt—lo 9 miles _ or so between breakfast
and lunch—will give the visitors a ravenous
appetite. The oldest inhabitant in that
part will be quenched in the midst of his
best anecdote, for the oldest inhabitant is
slow upon the feet of his mind (as witness
the Jacobs patriarch who used to discourse
outside the Cauliflower Inn), and the party
will be in a hurry. Murwillumbah —where
the big fire used to be —ought to be reached
by 10.30 that night. Heavyweight natives
will probably assemble at that hour, with
stretchers, and carry John Bull and his
sisters and his aunts to their well-earned
rest. Air cushions, and tubes to insert
liquid nourishment into the parched throats
of the travellers, would be taken in good
pa.rt. Any members of the party who are
alive on the following morning will be ten-
derly dealt with. A trip of 67 miles by
launch down one of Australia’s most beau-
tiful rivers, the Tweed, will recompense the
survivors for their generally indignant feel-
ing of having been banged to death over our
country roads. _ There are said to be coun-
try roads in this State on which the motor-
traveller only hits the seat twice in a mile.
The rest of the time he is in the air.
After these tremendous happenings the
party will take the mild and harmless train
for Brisbane and its occasionally-muddy
river.
Lady Denman will step ashore in this
town on or about September 27. Her
Feathers crosses the wet highway between
Vancouver and Sydney in the Niagara, and
will presumably hurry across the border the
same evening by express. She has no home
in Sydney, and her residence at Canberra
isn’t ready yet, though the plans of the
fence are in preparation, and designs are
being prepared for the back gate and the
400-gallon tank.
With her Ex. comes an elder brother,
Harold Pearson, M.P., and his wife. Mrs.
Harold is a daughter of the late Lord Ed-
ward Spencer-Churchill, and a cousin of our
late Haughtiness, Lady Chelmsford. She
is by way of being a beauty. Mr.
Pearson is a great sport, like his
sister, and is likely to chase the
flying hours across some of Victoria’s
top rails. Also voyaging to these shores
with the G.-G.’s lady, is a Petticoat of some
social tonnage who used to be the Hon.
Cecilia Knatchbull-Hugesson, and is now
Mrs. Prideux-Bruna A new Gentleman
Help named Pollok will attend the party.
He is in the 15th Hussars, and is a brother
of the pretty Mrs. Hore-Ruthven, who was
the brightest social gleam in the uncertain
sky of Dudley.
A.D.C. Pollok, by the way, is going to
step into the riding boots of the lately-
departed Nutting. He plighted his poio
ponies, and all that is his, to an Irish girl,
soon after he reached England. Now he is
married, and a few stunned comments on
the event are floating round the curling tongs
of our Most Expensive girls. Nutting
meant to return, and the Blow has fallen
like a whole Alp on our Best Suburbs.
An English correspondent flings a sigh at
the melancholy bedside watches of Victoria’s
sub-Governor’s wife, Fuller. Most of
her time on the other side is spent beside the
bed of her dying father.
A.D.C. Forbes has been disporting his
extreme length at Kosciusko during the
mid-August carnival. With Norwegian
Consul Fay (of Melb.) he did some snow
slithering of considerable Style the other
day. Austrian F. Malcher also dazzled the
company by getting over the wintry land-
scape like a chamois shod with seven-league
hoofs. Ice thick enough to carry a luggage
train has covered Lake Percy for weeks.
Every opportunity to cut fancy figures on
the freeze warmed up the blood of experts.
The less expert wore pale blue noses and
Arctic underwear. Blizzards have swept
across old Kosciusko with the swish that
you might raise in a Manchester depart-
ment if you tore all the calico to tatters in
a fit of delirium-rag-tearem. The ski and
skate party rested from their labors at a
fancy-dress dance in the hostel. Mrs. Tom
Dixson was “Duchess of Southhampton” at
this hop. Miss R. Baird, the Adelaide
ski-er, snatched first prize as “Cigarette.”
Her Grace of Southampton; Miss Turland,
who wore the meek drapery of a brotvn-
paper parcel; a “Harem lady,” after the
pattern of Lily Brayton in “Kismet;” a
“Chinese coolie” (J. H. Mactaggart, of
Brisbane) and his sister, demurely robed
as a Quakeress, are mentioned as convincing
events in this revel.
Captain Tim Healey, of the Orsova, cele-
brated his 43rd arrival in this port last
week. Of course the captain of the two-
ton or 40cwt. Balmain ferry-boat has ar-
rived much oftener than that, but there
aren’t peers and distinguished visitors, and
concerts, and balls, and the pleasant sound
of music and of dance on the Balmain boat,
so its frequent arrival passes almost un-
noticed. Captain Healey has made tons of
friends —and not more than a half-pint of
enemies—in this town during his frequent
recurrences and persistent repetitions. As
the Orsova snuggled up to the wharf the
other morning a large consignment of Cap-
tain Tim’s pals were waiting to produce
their vaccination marks, and rush aboard
to shake the mariner’s strong right top
extremity. Breakfast was a festive meal,
garnished with marine reminiscences. One
ancient. guest sailed with Jonah on the good
ship Whale, and his story was most inter-
esting. Also it was backed by Hebrew
bills of lading.
By the Orsova returned Mrs. 11. L.
Preston, daughter Mabel, who is to
marry Roy King in November. The Pres-
tons have been gadding on the other side
for about six months. During their stay in
London they were present at a successful
song recital. Tenor Chester Fentress, who
lifted up his voice in this latitude on Marie
Narelle’s last concert tour hereabouts, was
the .Voice.. Fentress has mostly camped in
Paris during the last four or five years,
with great advantage to himself and Paris.
The Ivor Etherington pair are packing
up the baby and other light luggage. They
leave Mrs. Ivor’s parental nest —the Henry
Gullett homestead at leafy Wahroonga—
for Colombo sooner than their original
scheduled time. The Orsova takes the
triplet hence on August 30.
Miss Ethel Haynes, a youthful daughter
of the well-known Dickie Haynes, K.C., of
Perth (W.A.) has been staying in this vast
conglomeration of people. She tripped home
with the recently-married Maddocks honey-
mooners in the Indarra. Mrs. Maddocks
was a Miss Milne (of W.A.), and a niece
of the late M. C. Davies, of the Swan State.
Dr. Chappie, who is M.P. for Stir-
ling in the House of Commons, made his
pile in Maoriland by lucky speculation. Two
nice little girls who were in the leggy epoch
of knee skirts when I saw them in Welling-
ton (M.L.) a few years ago, have shot up
into attractive young maidens, followed by
Court trains. They'were recently trimmed
and garnished to meet the royal eye, and
tossed three feathers apiece in the presence
of George, Rex and Emperor, also of Mary,
the Empress. Mamma, who waggled a long
tail at Court on the same occasion, is addicted
to all the domestic virtues, and used to have
a penchant for darning socks.
Small hats with no brim to keep the
freckles off your nose are more or less in-
evitable. That is, they are inevitable to
weak women who have a fixed notion that
they must toss the last extreme of fashion
on their heads. A muddy complexion and
a too generous helping of nose are much
assisted by a few kindly inches of brim.
As women are not all fools, one ventures
to predict that the hat of moderate size is
not going to spend the summer on the rub-
bish heap. One feature of the vellow
straw millinery is the gigantic single flower.
This trimming can perch anywhere you
choose so long as it quivers on six or seven
inches of lean stalk. When it hangs in a
horizontal line half a foot behind the
wearer’s back hair, it may be respectfully
described as a Floral Help in attendance on
Mrs. High-Flyer.
Mr. Dallas Dunbar, a financial big-wig
who is agent of the Bank of Madras in
Colombo, is coming this way for a holiday
in the near future. The directors of these
gilded vaults have their headquarters in
Madras, where they take as much care of
their livers as the climate and the excel-
le>"e of the local curry permits.
One of North Sydney’s attractive matrons,
Mrs. Fleurette Allan, is packing up her
nicest muslins for a voyage to Ceylon. She
hurries aboard the Zeiten on September 10.
The late Mr. M. C. Davies, who died the
other day in Perth (W.A.), leaves a solid
memorial of his up-to-to-morrow business
habits in Colombo. About 14 years ago,
this enterprising Australian was the primary
cause of the erection of the Australia Build-
ing in that city of bungalows. It was so
far ahead of the average mercantile office in
the swarthy hamlet, that it acted as a goad
to stir up commercial sahibs to put
more rupees into bricks and mortar. The
rebuilding of many ramshackle business
humpies or hen-coops was the result. This
country has recently acquired another
valuable plot of soil in the same colored
strand. .At present one of the handsomest
commercial offices in the neay Fast (which
is really North-West) is climbing up its
steel stays in eight or nine storeys of stone.
The National Mutual Life Association of
Australia will be housed in this palace at
Colombo.
The Gordon Edgells, of Bathurst, have
bustled off to Java in the Tasman. Plea-
sure is their main object. This will be
sandwiched in between a possible diversion,
in contemplating the exact amount of cubic
space the teeming millions of native popu-
lation will be able to occupy in 50 years.
Probably about one tree fork per family.
By the last mail from Java came a few
lines from Mr. Van der Gracht. He is the
man who went down to the Antarctic in the
Aurora, to sketch some of the coastline, and
he is rather more Dutch than his name
implies. He owns half a dozen other gems
of. nomenclature, which he wears only in
private, as some people wear red flannel,
next to his chest, so as not to worry Aus-
tralian tongues. Van der Gracht‘is at
present lecturing in Java. He is proving
his words, which paint Australia in rosy
tints, with lantern slides. Mynheer this,
that, and the other, and a swarm of British
tourists are nibbling at these glowing re-
marks, . and will probably bite later on.
Y\ ith him, or in adjacent villages, is Pho-
tographer Hurley. He is the Australian
who chased indignant Emperor Penguins
with a camera in the frozen South. The
Dutch Government is pursuing the travellers
with railway passes.
Tfie will of the late A. A. Dangar, of
(N.S.W.), has been proved at
±411,908. There s a trifle more (£2500) in
Victorian property. But the first quotation
shows, that, in spite of rabbits, droughts,
land taxes and other noxious weeds, our
beef and mutton squattocracy can still put
a shilling or two away for their offspring.
. ‘‘Hop’s” musical daughter, Dorothy, is
giving an evening soirde, to be devoted to
major and minor events. This will occur
in the Mosman Town Hall on August 27.
The clever Dorothy “Hop,” who takes her
feeling for a fiddle from her father, will be
assisted by Phyllis Smith, W. Id. Parkinson,
Gharles Pridham, Arthur Massey, and the
boy prodigy Marcus Burkitt. His sightless
eyes see fairy visions at the piano, and he
improvises like a juvenile Scharwenke.
Miss Marcia Brace, the English horticul-
tural lady who went a-farming up Glen
Innes_ way, has been training the Young
idea in Maoriland for a year or so. She
writes from the Hawkes Bay Girls’ College,
where she has been improving some acres
ot sod, that she expects to strike this port
about the second week in September.
The Royal Art Society has issued soulful
cards in pale gravy brown for its private
view day on August 30. The galleries (76
1 itt-street since the Federal signed-article
craze we hardly mention even the elephant
at the Zoo without giving its full address
and mentioning what time the tram-car
starts) will crowd on acres of canvas to
mark this 34th annual exhibition.
Genee has twirled on one toe and tossed
the other nine like a butterfly blown across
a zephyr, to the uproar of many recalls.
Butterflies, as our office referee remarks
are usually hatched without toes, so I sup-
pose the only Gende is the super-winged in-
sect .of the tribe. The gallery girls w T ere
waiting from some abnormal hour on Satur-
day morning to partake of the mixed glory of
first-nighters. Light refreshments—sticks of
chocolate and yards of enthusiasm—sup-
ported the watchers by the side door. At
halt-past four, or thereabouts, the portals
opened, and the young and strong fell upon
the stairs and stampeded into the fortress
of the gods. Gen6e, in spite of her butterfly
moods, has large slabs of ice and common
sense in her temperament. If she keeps her
threat, and settles down as Mrs. F Isitt
shell waltz into the butcher if that autocrat
doesn t send along the liver in time for the
breakfast bacon.
The Livingstone Centenary exhibition in
Concordia Hall was opened regularly every
afternoon last week from Tuesday. Prof.
David, at one of these serious diversions
Hung a graceful mantle of good words round
the name of David the explorer. Wandering
off to the Funafuti scientific expedition, of
which he ( Sydney’s professorial David) was
leader (1897), the speaker gave a rose-tinted
expression of his experience of missionary
efforts on that coral heap. He claimed that
there was only one instance of theft during
their visit to Funafuti. This was owing to
the abandoned conduct of some goggle-eyed
hermit-crabs who walked off with certain
fine shells collected by Marm David. Thev
were caught in the act. In tropic isles the
land-crab probably takes the place of the
house cat in our towns. ITe is the universal
thief, and hasn’t enough reputation left to
cover one claw. The China stalls were the
most attractive spots at this fair. The model
of a Chinese coffin, however, is a convincing
argument in favor of cremation.
Mrs. Phillips Fox, who follows the dual
occupation of being one artist herself and
the wife of another, is mixing her colors to
attack the lights and shades on our surf-
'oeaten shores.
The committee of the North Sydney
Women and Children’s Hospital Ball is
counting up its cash with much joyful
clatter of loose coins. The recent experiment
of boldly taking our chief municipal barn
for this event was more than justified by
results. This worthy charity has a few
hungry places still left in its bank account,
and the largest contributions will be grate-
fully accepted.
The Women’s Hospital (Crown-street)
seems to have got its muscle up in the
matter of chasing cash. Its annual ball
on September 1 will follow up the recent
raid on fat subscription lists, theatrical
matinees and such. The Paddington Town
Hall will be the place.
Those indefatigable ex-school marms, Miss
Hodge and her chum, Miss Newcomb, hold
forth on most topics under the moon, with
such breathless energy that there must be
some Talk germ buried in their comely
flesh. During their stay in England these
female samples of the friendship of David
and Jonathan were bitten with the militant
Spankedworst microbe. Woman, the down-
trodden, is their most vital subject for inter-
minable oratory. “The Multiplication of
the Unfit” is another cheery topic which
these estimable spinsters produce at lec-
turettes.
Another test lunch occurred in the Tech.
College last week. Six trainees in the
cookery classes, were again pledged to do
their best to fill those who were not hungry
with good things. Three damsels took
charge of the knife and fork display, waited
at table, and hung floral decorations from
every available hook in the room that turns
itself into a banquet hall if you only give
it a few minutes’ notice. Three more
scholars, very learned in the lore of braised
chicken, were buried in the mysteries of
turning out a 10-course snack. The Minis-
ter for Education presided at this feast, and
asked a highly-trained group of experts to
be present. Hugh Ward made a brief re-
mark or two, that may be boiled down to
the expression of his firm opinion that the
food was done to a turn. Lewis Waller was
briefer. ' Dramatist William Devereux
flung a nretty compliment at the General
Overseer, Miss A. M. Monro. (I suppose
the cook lady was hiding behind a crack
in the door, or blushing like boiled beetroot
in some secret fastness near the kitchen hob.)
Mummers Bantock and Bob Greig, who are
large and comfortable-looking persons to
ask to an extravaganza in beef and mutton;
the more angular Quartermaine ; Ray Royce,
whose smile is as soft as melted butter;
and Clerk-in-Charge-o.f-Something in the
Education Department, Walter Bethel,
munched the fatted oyster at this party.
The trainees passed this final practical proof
of their prowess with flying saucepans.
At the Women Painters’ show, Ruby
Winckler serves up the accepted or Calvin-
ist notion of the Last Day in black and
white. John Knox -would have thrilled at
this vision of able-bodied devils, armed with
long toasting-forks, prodding the crowded
procession of worldlings down under. A
king with his tongue hanging out is slipping
down the smoky track, and a few Trusts
may be diagnosed amongst the offerings to
Satan. A winged choir of immortals floats
upwards beside the great bonfire majority.
Theo Cowan’s bronze “Will-o’-the-Wisp” is
still dangling his out-size in lanterns just
behind the table where the Women Painters’
youthful secretary takes your name and ad-
dress, and 10 per cent, in advance on your
plunge in pictures. Alice E. Norton (Mrs.
A. Stephens) shows the results of wander-
ings in foreign climes. Her best group in-
cludes a charming water-color of the River
Nerira, at Bordighera. Edith Currie dab-
bles in homely scenes, and gets away with
a sketch of boats, in Woolloomooloo Bay,
and a small twilight impression of the out-
look from the macadamised heights of Dar-
linghursj;. Isobel Jacobs is reminiscent in
“Paris in a Snow-storm” (oils), which is
convincing enough to make you pull your
pneumonia lace vest up to your ears.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, August 18, 1913.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The Reid squattocrats, of Camperdown,
are beginning to settle down into the routine
of ordinary life again, Angus Reid, a crack
polo player, interrupted the usual placid
course of events by catching the appendix
complaint. Next, sister Lexie had her
wedding. Then Yi lieid. the girl
with the smooth red hair and the
creamy cmnplexion, caught the touring fever
and hurried off with some friends to Java,
fehe is now home again, and is getting ready
for the social tussle of race-time. Sister
Lexie is busy fixing up her new home.
Brother Angus is quite well again. The
story is almost thrilling if you happen to
know the family.
The squatting sports—or their valuable
nags—are showing up again in the winter
;,UE ? p Vi g races - At one time ’ the Manifolds
and Millers were absolute kings of the
steeplechase course. Then they dropped out,
or dropped behind, and only an occasional
win served to remind chronic racegoers of
their old records. Now the Manifolds are get-
ting the ascendancy again (they had two big
wins during the last CaulUeld meetings to
their credit), and Norman Faulkiner, by
virtue of his Bullawarra win. is looked upon
as a coming man in turf circles. Faulkiner
is certainly becoming Prominent. His big
victory here advertises his name, and. in
London, this year’s Royal Academy show
contains a portrait of Mrs. Faulkiner,
painted by Solomons.
The Manifolds of these times are busy get-
ting their sons and daughters married off
and settled down on the family estate at
Camperdown. They are forming a sort of
colony of their own in the fertile West.
Rumor informs me in the usual hoarse whis-
per that Chester Manifold recently footed a
bill for £2OOO for “improvements” to his
pet vicar s dwellinv-place. Money scarcely
seems “tight” in the Camperdown district,
ihe miserable, impecunious, dead-broke
Rich appear to have a few shillings over
when they have paid all their crushing taxes.
The 1 oorak Campbells, whose money has
wool sticking to it, are getting ready to
welcome son Cedric and his Yorkshire bride-
elect. Good-looking Cedric, who has rotated
in the best social circles, ends a blameless
bachelorhood in September. His future
lite-partner, Miss Diana Long, is as sporting
as her name suggests she should be.
Marjorie Sproule, handsome, blue-eved
and white-clad, became Mrs. Dr. Jones last
week The death of Mrs. Walter Sproule,
about a month ago, threatened to throw a
gloom over the ceremony ; but Mrs. Geoffrey
feyme lent her Kew home for the wedding
party, and so removed that festivity from
sad family surroundings. Eight small chil-
drSniT _110n 3 e them more than 1° years old
—followed the bride as diminutive maids-
in the youthful pageant
were three Syme babies, some Derham chil-
dren and a Temple Smith infant. They
looked _ sweet little lambs, dressed in the
expensive simplicity of white, with blue
socks and shoes and armsful of pink roses,
ihe wedding was at midday, and the couple
-ailed for England an hour later. The
newly-wed Mrs. Jones wore some beautiful
furs that host Geoff. Syme had invited her
to choose for herself, and, packed away in
her boxes were some lace and linen trea-
sures from his wife.
Toorak (that distressful country!) is in
convulsions. Wattle Day has been too much
for its nerves, and it is taking a rest cure
hnrJ ymS U° W and hard for the next charity
burst. Everybody hated everybody else
long before last Monday’s charitable'opera-
tions commenced. Now everybody hates
everybody worse than ever, and the dove of
leace is roosting high and wishing that it

held alternately in Melbourne and Svdiiev
is to rage at the Royal Golf Links, at Sand-
Rose Ra.v. Sydney, was entitled
to the solemn rites this September but
waived its claim on account of the socially
disastrous small-pox trouble and the at
quarant ] ne . bothers. Sandringham
will be a very festive place at the end of
this month. Social episodes of great mo-
ment will be sandwiched in with the devo-
party. he C imaX wiU be the Resident’s
nio£^ eClub dance is t 0 be to-
ight (Ihursday), and all the invited girls
are seething with excitement. Seething is
the normal state of most girls, but never
mind; maybe they are just seething a bit
more than usual. It is a cheap and easy
way ot passing the time when young, and no
one except perhaps an unreasonable father
or elder brother, who objects to screaming
and rushing, and needles and thread all over
the place, would object to a few weeks of it.
The Quinlan grand opera outbreak started
at Her Majesty’s on Saturday evening, and
the Best l ed People had to fling down their
serviettes in haste and tumble into their
waiting motors, in order to escape being
locked out for “The Mastersingers” over-
tUrej Several are suspected of having lin-
gered deliberately with that despicable end
m view. It is possible to like music and
yet stampede at the prospect of five hours
or so of Wagner. The half-dined or un-
dined who really and truly wanted to get
m early rolled along some time before sun-
down in a rather irritable state. Most of
them were curious as to what the long,
long night would be like. Some reckless
ones had not dined at all, but, sustained
by late afternoon tea, lived in hope of a
joyful resurrection supper. Tables at the
various cafes were ordered beforehand in
imperative tones, for, when you are in the
nabit of eating too much, you shiver at the
prospect of feeling really hungry. Thermos
cofiee and sandwiches in the theatre would
have solved the feeding problem very easily •
but no stalled party dared to make the ex-
penment. Late arrivals (it seems absurd to
oall them that!) were rigidly barred out
from the overture, which was sawed
°® P un S tu aHy at 6.45, until the end
of the first act. Eckhold, the new Wag-
nerian conductor, is a stout and business-
like Svengah with an unsensational style of
baton-waving. The opening performance
was not decorated or encumbered with a
vice-regal personage; but the orchestra duly
Anthemed the empty box before starting the
evening’s job.
The first act possessed all the hilarity of
a Ballarat South-street uproar with the
personal interest left out. The listeners
stifled their yawns in the sheltering depths
ot the Elizabethan fur collars, and revived
at scene-ends to applaud and make the usual
a PP r OP ri ate remarks. Meanwhile, they
asked one another in undertones when the
reM coffee interval would eventuate. That
blissful interlude arrived at 9.30. and the
pretty, cherry-ribboned tea girls of the
lounge had to fly to satisfy the out-throng-
i, Cro mu s , a PP eals for sandwiches and
Mocha. Ihe long second act or dose moaned,
and howled, and grumbled, and wept, and
yelled along until 11.20. Then the fag end
0 • intermin able evening was filled in
with the usual flowery managerial speeches
from the stage.
The imported chorus girls of the Quinlan
forces are very fat, and possess short, plump
understandings that contrast poorly with
the average Australian’s shapely limbs,
lhere are only two women principals in
the whole opera. Jeanne Brola, as Eva.
looked flaxenly pretty. She disguised all
signs of her natural brunette coloring ex-
cept her black eyes, which blazed with good
effect in the pink, white and gold of her
make-up. A Juliet-Marguerite tvpe of frock
was worn and once it was sky-blue and
gold slashed. _ For the most affecting love
scenes the prima donna wore white, bro-
caded and draped in quite the modern edi-
tion of the Old World style.
The brewery Fitzgeralds occupied a pen.
Ihe orchestra overflowed into the two stage
boxes, and the deafened front stallites must
have wished themselves in the gallery or
even right outside. Mrs. Henry Cornish,
all pink and pastel tints, made a youthful
chaperone to Beryl Fitz, all in paddy green.
Beryl had been playing “The Mastersingers”
music on the thumpanola for a month, bv
way of familiarising herself with the various
uproars and calamities of the outbreak. She
looked quite pleased, but Rumor says that
the battered machine is not likely to get
over it. Russell Clarke and Norton Grim-
wade whispered darkly together in the lobby,
-they were probably concocting some plan
for escaping to the open air. Mrs. Russell
Clarke, in white, and Mrs. Grimwade,
wrapped in the newest church-window com-
bination of cerise and purple, made an ex-
fr elle xv api^arance o f liking every note of
it. Mrs. Geoffrey Syme, out for the first
time after an illness, was dressed in white
and clinging gold silk. Mrs. Oswald Syme
dimpled in champagne color. Mrs Armv-
tage brought a party of Camperdown girls
When it was possible to talk without being
frowned down, everybody speculated with
awe as to the opera which threatens to be-
gin before the fowls go to roost. “Bohfeme ”
Butterfly ’ and “Tales of Hoffmann” have
all been skied to matinees this time. The
ponderous “Ring” threatens to vanquish all
but the chronically musical. (You may re-
member the opera endurance test matron of
last Quinlan season. She was heard to sigh
thankfully, on emerging from the usual
feast of music, “Thank goodness, I’ve only
got four more to do!” There are heaps of
social jobbers like her, only they lack her
1 frankness.) “The Mastersingers”
is gorgeously mounted. The color pictures
almost lighten the dead weight of the music
for the skulking wretch who hankers for a
tune' now and then. Men wore colors gaily
and sported quaint decorations in those
days. One song competitor wore cameos
like oyster shells on his sleeves. Artists of
the Quinlan co. billed for later performances
sat attentively in front. A little, blue-eyed
soprano of yester-year partied with the per-
sistent Pinschofs.
Nordica, singing on Tuesday night last
week, was draped classically in white ; but the
ancient Greeks would have torn up Athens
before they found any fabric to compare with
the modern fashionable mixture of silk, vel-
vet and gossamer of which the dress was
constructed. The singer’s neck was heavily
gemmed with half a dozen chains of big, fat,
white pearls, while green jade and diamonds
served as a breastplate. She got so much
in key with her audience that the privi-
leged Front Row at last begged its own
choice of encores over the footlights. The
Nordica co. has a friendly way of filling
in intervals by having a word or two with
pianist Simmons. Amongst the vegetable
trophies handed up was a big bush of Aus-
tralian bluegum. When it was flung at the
singer’s feet, it gave off the distinctive per-
fume of the bush. Nordica has been motor-
ing into the country in little, hurried sprints,
and admits being fascinated and charmed
by the bluegum’s spring foliage. When
dressed for the road, she looks cute in a
black outfit which includes a big black veil
carefully arranged to show off her com-
plexion. . Well, at this gum-perfumed con-
cert Society sat humbly at her accredited
feet. Peter Mitchell, who owns the famous
Trafalgar horse, sat in the front stalls (the
horse wasn’t with him), and remarked loudly
that Nordica was -“a plum.” (After that
Criticism rolled over and peacefully ex-
pired.) Mrs. Peter, handsome and black-
haired, shook out and thoroughly aired her
diamonds alongside. Miss Crawford and
her mother came from the inner fastnesses
of Toorak to listen and criticise; but, after
hearing Mr. Mitchell’s verdict, they probably
refrained. Mrs. Hugh Patterson had a
brace of very bright and musical daughters
enjoying the concert. Mrs. Stugrt Murray
mixed purple and cerise in a gown without
coming to any harm; and Mrs. Shipman
dared a scarlet coat with her Titian hair.
It was a brightly-colored event and full of
warmth.
Lillian Nordica’s last appearance was
mostly. a woman’s concert. Men were al-
lowed in, of course; but they did not avail
themselves of the great privilege. A small
army of white-clad maidens, carrying clas-
sical-looking staves of gold and wattle,
formed themselves into a double line on the
platform and made a guard of honor for the
entering singer. That was at the begin-
ning of the concert. At the end, Vida Gold-
stem, a slim little figure in white, fluttered
up on the platform and voiced the Sex’s
regret at parting with Nordica, ere handing
her a practical expression of something or
other bound in solid leather. The fare-
welled one sang her reply—a sweet, sugary
song all about hearts and roses. Later her
dressing-room was invaded by the Past
Grands of various female sects and tribes,
also by the Pinschofs, Barretts and some of
the newly-arrived Quinlan stars whom thev
had caught and caged in their motors. Mrs.
Hugh Patterson went round to collect
daughter Ksther, who was sitting working
with cold hands on the last touches of the
Nordica portrait. Hugh Buckler and his
decorative wife came along to take fervent
farewells, and the massed women crowded
the pavement outside and whooped Nordica
into her car.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
Mr. R. M. Cudmore won the Point to Point
Steeplechase at Findon on Saturday aboard his good
steed Texas. This feat is becoming an absolute
habit with Mr. Cudmore. The race was postponed
from July 19, on account of the absence of rain, of
the Governor and of the Hunt Club’s president, Mr. H.
D. Young. As a matter of fact, any one of these
disasters would have been almost enough in itself
to blight the entire meeting. En masse,, so to
speak, they were intolerable. Part of the crowd
fed in a marquee at the invitation of the Hunt Club.
Others slaked their thirst and so on at the Golf
Club-house, where Mrs. Max Anderson was hostess.*
What with bicycles and motor bicycles, carts and.
motors, cabs and trailers, the road reminded one
powerfully of trouble in the Balkans or something
like that. However, no one was slain. Amongst the
horde I saw Miss Bosanquet and Captain Walker,
the Leonard Bakewells, Mr. and Mrs. Waterhouse
Mr. Frank Downer, the Cecil Brays, Mr. and Mrs.
Borman Brookman, Mrs. Rov Milne and her sister
Dr. and Mrs. Burstor., the Peter Woods and their
daughter, the Arthur Rymills, Mrs. Girdlestone and
her niece, Miss Margaret Hughes, Mrs. Reg Colley
Mr Stewart Bright and Mrs. Charlie Downer.
A ball was given on Monday night in the Elder
Hall by the University Women. Lady doctors,
female B s.S., etc., etc., two-stepped like mere
miners—an impressive spectacle, I do assure you
Roses, wattle-blossom and art muslin provided’ an
efficient disguise for the walls and ceiling. And
they needed it. Dr. Plummer and Dr. Helen Mayo
were both in black, Dr. Chappie in pale blue and
pink, and Dr. Florey in blue with a black veiling.
Mrs. A M. Cudmore’s white frock boasted some
delectable pink and blue embroidery, and Mrs
Frank Fisher draped herself in a successful fuchsia-
toned garment. Mrs. J. R. Corpe and Miss Mar-
garet Hughes also scored for artistic frocking, and
Mrs. Campbell Magarey’s yellow brocade was an
enviable affair. Mrs. Gavin Gardiner, Mrs. A E
Nott, Mrs. A. A. Hamilton, Mrs. Cecil Fisher, Mrs.
de Crespigney and Mrs. Gautier were also among the
guests.

POLITICAL
POINTS
“Henry Ilorsecollar”: I have just come
across this utterance by the Rev. Leyton
Richards, of Melbourne :
The reason alleged for the necessity for compul-
sory military training is the fear of armed invasion
by Japan. By the introduction of decent courtesy
into our foreign policy we can remove all fear of
any such invasion.
Quite so! Everybody in this world is so
good that nobody does any harm to any-
body except under sufficient provocation!
On the same basis I suppose the rev. gentle-
man would hold that if the Saviour had
used decent courtesy towards the Scribes
and Pharisees He wouldn’t have been
crucified. I haven’t quite got down to that
point, but apparently a section of the
Church has.
The debating weakness of the Vic. As-
sembly, especially on the Opposition side,
was conspicuous when it discussed Murray’s
concession to the Y.R.C. of the right to
charge admission money to the Flemington
Flat. Warde’s attack was lengthy and lum-
bering, and he missed the point that the job
was deferred until Watt had left for Eng-
land. If he had granted the concession he
would infallibly have lost votes at the next
election, for Flemington Flat is as much in
Watt’s as in Warde’s district. Well armed
and confident, Watt rose in all his debating
power, played round Warde like, a terrier
round a mouse., and won on a division with
an overwhelming majority. No doubt .he
would have won in any case, but the im-
potence of the Opposition in debate must
have been worth half a dozen votes at least.
S URVEYING AT YASS-
CANBERRA.—KEEPING
NEAR THE WATER
SUPPLY
As to a railway from Canberra to Jervis Bay,
surveys were now being carried out, and his Govern-
ment would lose no time in linking up the Federal
capital and the Port. — W. H. Kelly, M.H.R.
The remark of Patten, one of the Cookite
members of the House of Reps.:—
I agree with the Prime Minister that if we cannot
carry on the business of the country with credit we
won’t carry it on at all.
That same old, weary credit! If only some-
one would arise full of a cast-iron and
boiler-metal resolve to carry on the business
of the country with cash !
It has been announced' that the N.S.W.
Government doesn’t propose to move in the
matter of the Sydney-North Shore bridge
this session. Well, did anybody who knew
anything of the case imagine that the Syd-
ney-North Shore bridge would be proceeded
with this session? That bridge has been
just going to be built for 40 years or more,
and always something or somebody has hap-
pened to prevent it being proceeded with
“this session.”
Few can be blessed in Maoriland Labor
circles considering the dearth of peace-
makers. Thus David McLaren, one of the
leaders of the “evolutionary” section, after
taking part in a conciliatory conference with
what may be called the revolutionary sec-
tion :
I am amused to find anti-militarists supporting
industrial unionism, in a form which is compulsory,
military and autocratic. It seeks to organise the
worker into a great class army, with the idea that
any injury done to the enemy, the employers, will
be to the advantage of the workers. Its programme
includes strikes of all kinds, and sabotage, which
means the destruction of property.
The other fellow’s opinion of McLaren was
originally quoted in Numbers xxii verse 29.
McGirr, a new member, wandering
through a corridor in N.S.W. Parliament
House the other night, got an idea that
Cohen was about to smash Hollis with his
fist, instead of with his tongue; whereupon
McGirr sailed in, and smote the enemy. In
10 seconds McGirr had found out that it
was all a mistake, and. next day poured out
humble apologies, which Cohen accepted.
There have been times in N. S. Wales when
the injured member has refused to be thus
comforted; but mostly he hasn’t got much
change out of Judge and jury. John Taylor
claimed £5OOO from J. D. Young and got
only 40 per cent.; John Davies wanted
£20.000 from John Harris, and got one
farthing; and John Haynes claimed £5OOO
from James Fletcher, and got £5, or there-
abouts. On that record Cohen made the
best bargain both for his pocket and his
temper when he decided to accept the
enemy’s assurance that he was sorry he had
been such a clumsy ass —or thereabouts.
A POLITICAL ACROBAT.
Mr. Cook has decided that day labor on Govern-
ment works is to cease, and that the contract sys-
tem will take its place. —News item.
It was Mr. Cook who, as P.M.G. of New South
AVales in the Reid Government, introduced the day-
labor system. He wiped out the contract system for
the making of telephone tunnels, against great oppo-
sition. —Comment by a Labor politician.
The N.S.W. State Liberal party has put
a decentralisation plank on its platform. Sp
now (praise be unto the saints and the pigs
and all other people concerned !) the decen-
tralisation idea is on every political plat-
form. It doesn’t get any further, for the
Sydney mercantile influence blocks the way,
just as the Sydney-North Shwe bridge gets
no further by reason of things that block
the way. But it is a beautiful and cheering
item of news that the plank is in the Liberal
platform.
When ex-Speaker Willis was having liis
cleaning-up at N.S.W. Parliament House
and sacked several probably unnecessary
attendants, there was a shriek from the daily
papers about injustice and victimisation,
and they yelled for inquiries, and demanded
that these men should be re-instated. But
when Jokook si-
lently—chucks out brother Henry
Chinn, whom O’Malley had ap-
pointed engineer-in-charge of the
Fremantle end of the East-and-
West railway that didn’t bring the
Fisher party as many yotes as it
had expected, there isn’t a mur-
mur. “It is true,*’ said Jokook,
“I can say nothing. I want to
let the matter drop and be for-
gotten.” And, so far as the Tory
press is concerned, it did drop.
The Tory* press didn’t - even men-
tion that a Supreme Court Judge,
sitting under a Royal Commission,
had found the charges against Chinn either
unproved or disproved.
The N.S.W. Assembly is fast returning
to its old frivolous Avays. Two recent events
were the assaulting of Cohen, M.L.A., by
McGirr, M.L.A., and the spectacle of
Meehan, M.L.A., drifting round the House
with a pot of liquor, which he offered with
a bright smile to members of the Opposition.
That sort of thing is humorous, no doubt,
but it belongs to the crude, ancient British
A r ariety of humor which consisted in tying a
potsherd to the tail of a dog, and chasing
the beast round King Arthur’s court.
THE TRUSTED ALLY.
Neither in history nor in our own recent experi-
ence can any justification be found for the suggestion
that Liberalism and social reform are antagonistic.
Of this work there is always a great deal to be done
in the progressive world, and it is certain that the
future will find Liberalism ready and capable for the
task as the past has always found it.
Sydney TELEGRAPH.
MAN IN THE CAR: "That's right, old friend!
Keep on as usual! I'll let you know if
you go too fast for me!”
That baker’s dozen of Country party
malcontents who lately sponsored an abor-
tive no-confidence motion in the Vic. As-
sembly i's quite tame again and feeds out
of the hand as of yore. When the Chief
Secretary’s estimates were being considered
last week, most of them, as well as other of
Watt’s followers, condemned the irregular
grant of £5OO to the Public Service Com-
missioner, but all, with one exception, voted
with the Government. Meanwhile, the re-
construction of the Ministry, for which the
citizens were alleged to be calling aloud,
has not happened, and the Ministers, who
were said to have nobody’s confidence, are
in their old places. Party Government is a
dreadfully illogical, slipshod, undemocratic
circumstance.
The sacred traditions of the N.S.W.
Legislature were stung to the quick when an
hon. member .presented a petition to the
Assembly last week, signed by 14,000 per-
sons, praying that authorisation be given to
the establishment of a crematorium. Speaker
Morton raised the petition, and as he gazed
upon it his horse-hair stood on end, and hor-
ror paled his brow, also his nose. Presently
he gasped: “This is oht of order; it is
TYPEWRITTEN !” It was too true. Ac-
cording to the regulations, it would have
been all right if it had been scrawled by a
half-drunken individual with a hairpin and
faint ink on greasy paper in a pitch black
cellar, but typed clearly, so that even J. C. L.
Fitzpatrick would have no excuse to mis-
take it —a murrain upon it. likewise a lock-
jaw and two gallstones. The last seen of
the unspeakable document was the Black
Rod carrying it away with his official tongs
in one hand and his nose in the other.
While turning the preliminary clod of the
Barellan (N.S.W.) railway, State Minister
Griffith is reported as having “defended his
borrowing policy.” Well, every man has a
right to his own opinion, and Griffith has
a perfect r>ght to be 'an honest advocate of
a large borrowing policy, just as everybody
has a right to be an honest Jesuit. But a
Jesuit who gets g profitable job by pretend-
ing to be a Presbyterian is beneath con-
tempt. And when the most heavy-borrow-
ing Ministry in the State’s record gets its
job on a programme of economy, reduced
borrowing, and no loan expenditure except
for works which will pay full interest and
sinking fund, it is just political dirt. Also
it is a political disgrace. Furthermore, the
fact that not one member of it dare attempt
to explain away this monstrous fraud brands
it as a political cur.
“Plutarch Smith” does some prophesy-
ing :
M.L. politics at present are calm and gliding, and
the Speaker is having an easy job among urbane
statesmen who bleat as if they were in for' a soft-
answer competition. Oily politics in Maoriland
raise apprehensions ; the lieges feel safest when there
is a row oh, and honest indignation vituperates a
bit. But the present Opposition has no kick, and
M.L. yearns for the touch of genius that will shpply
one. The “touch of genius” means, of course, lou
AVard. Wellington Town Hall, the other day, was
packed to receive him from the clinging arms of the
Ma-land. The Liberal mummy sat up in its casket
and gibbered of leadership. It wants once again to
be led by Joseph—by the nose, if there is no other
way, and Joe will lead it all right. He has been
ashore only two days, but has made a start. He is
It! Listen to him saying that there are four hun-
dred millions sterling in the Old Land that the
owners don’t know exactly what to do with. And
Massey’s henchman, Allen, had to sprint to get a beg-
garly couple of millions! Obvious moral: Try Joe.
The newspapers are already rushing him up with joy
headings: “Plenty of money. Hooray! That’s what
we want.” To signalise the return of the workers’
hope. Labor escorted the Baronet from the wharf,
stepping it out to the glad tocsins of the Waterside
Workers’ Band. Attention to such details is true
genius. Massey with his paltry two or three- mil-
lions may hide his diminished head ; his Govern-
ment is booked. Progressive Democracy in M.L.
wants overtime and cheap butter. ’Who said lou
and interest to pay! Off with his head!
Elmslie, deputy-leader of
Vic. Labor party, congratu-
lates Australia on being in
the blessed position of hav-
ing its Governors forced;
upon it. It gets them free-
of party bias in this way;
consequently they can always:
exercise impartial judgment,,
says Mr. Elmslie. Then why
doesn’t Mr. Elmslie go the 1
whole logical hog and advo-
cate the importation of
Judges and Public Service-
Commissioners, and police
magistrates? In fact, the
perfect arrangement would,
apparently be to send Elms-
lie to legislate for Kams-
schatka and import some-
Kamschatkan to put Aus-
tralia on the right track to-
salvation. But, pending that great reform,
the Laborite who thinks the average Gov-
ernor made in England is not a party man
should be asked by his constituents to ex-
plain how it is he is not in the habit of
meeting bricklayers and journeymen bakers
at Governors’ garden parties ; and he might
also be invited to mention when he last
danced with the bootmaker’s missus at a
vice-regal hop.
Said a Sydney shopkeeper to a Bulletin
man the other day: “A year ago the land-
lord raised my rent £1 a week because
trade was good. Last week he raised it
pound because money was tight.”
From Hansard for 1904: —
Mr. Cook : When I was secretary to a trade union
we always insisted on preference to unionists, and
in a very summary fashion.
Mr. Crouch : What was the union ?
Mr. Cook: The Coal Miners’ Union. We had no
difficulty in doing that, and I am free to tell the
hon. member that if I were in the same position
to-day I should do the same again. I have no sort
of sympathy with the man who will work alongside
another man and see that other man paying every
week of his life into an organisation to protect his
rights, and to maintain his position, while he him-
self is skulking and deriving the benefit for which
the other is paying and working.
Now Luck (which Joe says doesn’t exist)
has played him the trick of putting him
into that very office in which, at the call
of his Tory masters, he has had to abolish
the preference of which he declared himself
a stalwart supporter. So much for Joseph's
“leadership” !
“Cripps Clark” concerning an “also
ran” :
The mysterious John Gray Pearson who butted
into the recent fight between the “authorised” com-
batants for the Wollondilly seat in the N.S.W.
Assembly, appears to have been a political Mrs.
Harris. He was labelled “Independent” in the press,
but, so far as my investigations have gone, he made,
no effort to woo "the electors. Not one of them will'
own up to having seen John Gray Pearson, neither-
can anyone be found who heard or read John Gray
Pearson’s views. The only clue to his existence as:
an . active candidate was offered by a small boy who.
told me he had seen “a strange bloke whispering
something into a rabbit burrow.” (A great decrease
of rabbits has been noticed in the Wollondilly.) A
perusal of the electoral lists of Wollondilly failed’
to find the name of John Gray Pearson thereon, so
if he came at all he must have come from afar. But
no one knows whence he came or whither he went..
Presumably he was nominated by at least six per-
sons on the roll, but who were they, and why did!
they do it? A suspicion is gaining ground that this;
elaborate joke was worked off for the sole purpose
of enabling a humorless personage in the alleged
Liberal party to point the finger of scorn at .T.G.P.
as an “Independent” who, as usual, was among the
“also rans.” He was apparently nominated to serve
as a warning to all “interlopers” who dare to think
that an ever-increasing number of electors are
heartily sick of • the eternal fight between the Libs,
and the Labs., and would welcome a candidate with
brains and honesty enough to do the work he is
elected to perform, instead of wasting his time in
casting abusive epithets at his political rivals for
place and pay.
THE HIGH JUMP.
Max Rittenberg, a Sydney-side Austra-
lian who crossed over to England and got

BE NOT MILITARY, BUT CIVIL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The reason alleged for the necessity for compul-
sory training is the fear of an armed invasion by
Japan. By reconstruction and the introduction of
decent courtesy into our foreign policy we can re-
move all fear of any such invasion.
—Rev. Leyton Richards, of Melbourne.
It is not arms Australia needs,
It is not men and ships,
Not bulldog deeds and doughty deeds,
But, rather, servile lips.
AVe have to learn to bend our knees,
And answer sweetly: “If you please!”
AVe have no call for costly schools
To teach the younger lads
The horrid rules and deadly tools
Of military cads ;
But chapels where they’ll learn to be
Small models of civility.
In time they may be taught, mayhap,
To bow with proper grace,
To doff the cap to every Jap,
And pull a pretty face,
And in no circumstance to show
A trace of rudeness to the foe.
’Tis thus the country may dispel
Its armed-invasion fear ;
For shot and shell no need will dwell
Among invaders here
AVhen we have learned to duck and grin,
And say: “God bless you! Come right in.”

NOTHING TO EQUAL IT.
“For the immediate relief and complete cure of
influenza, there i? nothing- equal to Chamberlain’s
Cough Remedy,” writes Miss Fanny Bonhote, Marra-
wah (Tas ). “It has relieved me of this complaint,

have found it to cure coughs and colds in almost
any form. One dose has always given me relief and
one bottle always cures my colds.”*
SICK HEADACHE.
WOMEN SUBJECT TO FREQUENT
THROBBING, BURSTING HEADS.
There’s many a cause. Men are not often
troubled by headaches ; when they are it is
generally due to biliousness or indigestion.
But women have headaches whicii seem
peculiar to their sex, frequent throbbing
headaches. Does it not seem that such
headaches peculiar to women must be a!
once related to womanly disease? Women
who suffer with diseases peculiar to the sex
do not realise the drain of vital strength
and nerve force they undergo as a conse-
quence of disease. It is this that causes
the headaches of sick women. In other cases
these pains and disagreeable feelings are
generally symptoms of some other com-
plaint, such as indigestion, biliousness and
constipation, all of which are caused by cor-
rupt, noxious matter clogging the circula-
tions ; hence a stream or rush of blood to
the head, and by the excitement a great
pressure on the brain. “I was,” writes
Mrs. Sarah Curzon, of 26 Broughton-street,
North Sydney, “at one time subject to
severe headaches and neuralgic pains in the
head, which would cause much distraction-
nearly driving me mad, the shooting and
•throbbing across the temples being very dis-
tressing, and I seemed to be completely run
down and nervously prostrated. I coulo
scarcely do any work, and tried many reme-
dies, but could not find any to give me tn
relief that I have received on taking y° u
valuable remedy, Dr. Morse’s Indian Roo
Pills. I rarely ever suffer now, but it in-
disposed at any time I take a few of the
pills, and they not only ward off the at t a
but make me feel quite well. I think tn .
are splendid, and am pleased to be able
give you a small testimony as to their he
ing qualities, which you may use if y° u s
desire.*
SPORTING
NOTIONS
I’arke, the brilliant Irish tennis-player
who knocked Brookes out in Melbourne last year,
knocked his own partner out in London last month.
It was the crack lady player, Mrs. Larcombe; in
making a high overhead smash he simply felled her
with his racquet. This was particularly bad luck,
as it finished her for the week, and she was in the
final not only of the mixed doubles but of the
ladies’ single championship as well.
The mystery as to who really won the
French Grand Prix Motor Race has been cleared up
by the arrival of English files giving full particulars
of the event. The Dunlop Rubber Co. received a
cable the day after the race, and announced G.
Boillot, in a Peugeot, as the winner ; with J. Goux,
on a similar machine, second; and Chassaigne, in a
Sunbeam (England), third. Later on a press cable
gave the first place to Bablot, in a Delage; with
Guyot, on another Delage, second ; and Pilette, in a
Mercedes* third. The average speed was given as
83 miles per hour, against Boillot’s 72. The English
files prove the Dunlop cable to have been correct.
The race started at 5.30 a.m. in a heavy fog, which
made it necessary for the drivers to proceed with
extreme caution. Later on, the sun broke through
and a glorious day followed. The five countries com-
peting were France, England, Italy, Germany and
Belgium, represented by 20 cars. The first round
saw Moriondo, in the Itala, capsize on the banked
road in front of the grandstand, fortunately with-
out serious results. Boillot had a tremendous race
with Goux, the Indianapolis winner, but eventually
beat him by 24min. The English car with the
foreign driver was nearly lOmin. behind. Bablot
was fourth, Guyot fifth and Resta sixth. Only 11
cars finished the course.
The death of aviators through bumping
the ground with excessive force in falling aeroplanes
has become monotonous. Men have cheerfully
climbed thousands of feet through the atmosphere
on unstable contraptions without making the least
effort to provide for a secondary means of safety in
event of the machine going wrong. There seems to
have been no attempt to fit any aeroplane with a
parachute attachment which, in the event of the
wings giving way or the engine blowing itself to
pieces, would open out and bring the tumbling .mass
to earth at a slow speed and with little force. Until
Leo Stevens, of Noo Yark, got busy, no attempt was
made to provide even the aviator with a parachute.
Leo has designed a sort of aerial lifebuoy in the
shape of a small parachute, which is folded on the
back of the flying man. If he falls overboard, or
the sky-ship begins to sink rapidly and in several
pieces, all he has to do is tug a small cord that
hangs over his shoulder. The parachute flies open,
gets a grip on the ambient atmosphere and brings
the human part of the business to earth in a succes-
sion of circuitous eddies. There are. great points
about the idea so long as the opening of the para-
chute can be assured..
* * ¥■ *
The followers of League Rugby got a
surprise in Sydney on Saturday, when the red-
garbed Glebe team overthrew the premier mob,
Eastern Suburbs, by 14 points to nine, on the Agri-
cultural Ground. East Sydney started magnificently,
while Glebe seemed to be sorely afflicted with ner-
vousness, and blundered round in a helpless fashion.
But, all the same, it was capable of a better defence
than was apparent, and at half-time the premier
team, although easily on top all through, was lead-
ing by seven to nil only. Still, it looked more than
enough to go on with. Then they changed ends, and
Glebe had the advantage of the wind. East soon
afterwards lost a man, and Glebe suddenly recovered
its form. Its nerves became as hard as steel, and
it let loose some most brilliant passing charges. Its
defence was perfect in its combination, and East
began to fade away. Against that suddenly
acquired but perfect combination it would have been
hard put to it to hold its own at any time; but
against the wind and a man short it was hopeless.
Glebe continued to pile up the score, and made 14
points while the premier crowd added only two,
making its total score nine. North Sydney was at
home to South, and rolled it up in a neat, business-
like manner by 17 points to nine. Annandale met
Newtown, and found its victorious rush suddenly
checked, the latter just managing to dish the baby
club by 10 points to eight. Western Suburbs rolled
Balmain in the dust bv eight points to three. Of
course, the defeat of East Sydney makes no differ-
ence in the team’s position. It is still leading in
the competition by 24 points to the 21 of Newtown,
the nearest rival; and has the premiership for the
third year in succession. In 1911 and 1912 Glebe
was runner-up ; this year it is Newtown. The pre-
mier club lost only two matches during the season,
and scored 227 points aarainst the 118 put up against
it. It scored 45 tries and 46 goals, and had 20 tries
and 20 goals registered against it. The best scorer
of tries for the year was Glebe, which made 50; but
its faiure to convert them was considerable, as it
had only 26 goals and was fourth in the competition.
In the Union division of the Rugby
game, East Sydney, hitherto unbeaten, also came to
grief, and, by strange co-incidence, the cause of the
downfall was also Glebe. Another curious fact is
that, in spite of the double defeat, the Eastern
Suburbs score in both competitions is eight points
more than that of Glebe. In the League, Eastern
Suburbs has 24 to 16 ; and in the Union, 22 to 14.
But whereas Glebe is fourth in the League list, it is
runner-up in the Union. In Saturday’s game Glebe
treated the premier team with horrible disrespect.
Immediately the ball was set going it charged, and
continued to do it till it got what it wanted.
Although the kick at goal failed the red team was
not downhearted, and was over the line again before
East realised what was happening. Half-time found
Glebe leading by nine points to three. The resump-
tion found Glebe as aggressive as ever. East Svdney
began to show signs of making a stand, but it was
too late, and Glebe triumphed by 21 points to nine.
Balmain managed to crawl over Western Suburbs by
five to three, but it had great luck to succeed in
doing that. St. George fell on Manly and crumpled
it up by nine to three, while University played an
eight-points-all draw with a team representing the
Northern Districts, wherever thev may be. The A
division of the Union competition is composed of
Eastern Suburbs, 22 points; Glebe, 14 ; and Uni-
versity and Newtown, 13 each.
* * * *
The Rawson Cup, the outward and visible
sign of Soccer supremacy, is now trembling on the
i*im of the future. Balmain and Newtown are level
in the conapetition with 14 points each, but New-
town has to re-play its match with Sydney, the
holder of the Cup. There is a general impression
that the genius of Sydney has gone to the woods,
its calves to grass, and its capability to the Devil.
So the victory of Newtown is regarded as certain,
in which case Newtown will take the goblet and the
premiership. As Newtown has never yet had its
muddied hands on the trophy the suburb is sim-
mering with excitement. In Saturday’s matches
Newtown kept level with Balmain by overthrowing
Granville (three goals to nil), while Balmain kept
in its stride by trampling over Northern Suburbs by
two goals to nil. Sydney got a presage of what is
coming to it when it Was jumped on by Glebe (one
goal to nil). Annandale went out with its best
girl, having received a forfeit from Canterbury.
After holding the Ilanfurly Shield, the
visible sign of Maoriland Rugby supremacy, for some
time, Auckland has been torn down by Taranaki to
the tunc of 14 points to 11. The touring N.S.W.
Rugby Union team, which will shortly invade Maori-
land, will play its first matches with Auckland and
Taranaki respectively.
On Saturday the Vic. League suspended
its games to give South Oss its revenge for the
thrashing administered in the Holy City on July 12.
The Crow-eater team was said to be the strongest
that had ever left the Crow-eating State —as to
which the writer expresses no opinion. He hasn’t
seen the others, and doesn’t want to. Some 15,000
persons viewed the collision, which was tidy, orderly,
open, not unduly strenuous—in fact, everything it
ought to be except exciting. South Oss went off
at a good bat, and, except for its poor goal shooting,
held its own through the first quarter. There were
hopes that its forwards would improve, but the
second term found the Vies, playing together like a
seasoned team, and they began to make an exhibition
of their opponents. When they passed it was mostly
straight to the man in the correct position, who
always seemed to be waiting unguarded. They
kicked freely and handballed only when compelled.
Above all things, they made the pace so hot that
it flabbergasted the Crow-devourers. By the third
quarter most of the interest had vanished, and spec-
tators amused themselves speculating, as the ball
was methodically passed down the ground, which
of the three Vic. forwards would boot it through.
At lemon-time the tally was Vic., 15 goals eight
behinds; S.A., five goals 11 behinds. When the
bell rang the Gumsuckers boasted 108 points, the
Crow-eaters 53. And when you recollect that no
member of the two leading League teams —’Roy and
’Wood —was playing, the magnitude of the Adelai-
deans’ disaster can be appreciated.
EDGE O’ DREAMLAND.
Bill Lang sits down to a shower of wallops
from “Nutty " Curran before getting the decision
at Baker's Sydney Stadium.
The Vic. Ass., having no inter-State battles
on its hands, bogged into the fray as usual, and
finished up its first round. Four of the games
counted, inasmuch as defeat meant loss of position.—
go close were the leading teams—and to Essendon the
loss of a place in the “ flnal f our .” Being fully
seized of this, ’Don, which met Brunswick, pranced
round and perspired recklessly in the effort to get
there; and at three-quarter time had compiled 52
points to ’Wick’s 47. Apparently it dawned on
’Wick at this stage that, as it couldn’t be outed
from the four, it might as well lose and stand fourth
as w jn an( j be second; anvhow, the Brickies eased
off in the last term, and ’Don piled on an additional
seven goa ] s —totals, ’Don, 95 points; ’Wick, 54. In
the other games the anticipated victories duly came
off; North wa lloping Port by 98 to 60, ’Town beat-
j ng Brighton by 85 to 58, and ’Scray stamping on
P ’ ran by 58 40. This writer herewith hands a
sympathetic wreath or bouquet or something to
’Town, which bucked up under adverse circumstances,
played a well-laundered game and only missed reach-
jng “the four” by the toe of its boot, so to speak,
He a ] so hands an unsympathetic brick to the lament-
abie Melb. Citizens, who won one game last year,
and none at all this, and whose barrackers celebrated
their final defeat on Saturday—at the feet of ’Cote,
by 94 points to 28—by rushing the ground and
stoushing the luckless umpire as he made for th"
pavilion. Doubtless that official wasn’t perfect—only
Liberal politicians achieve that feat—but it doesn t
lie with supporters of the Melb. City F.C. to rebuke
imperfection. Fortunately the said Citizens, and five
other teams, will now cease from rioting till 1914,
and it is to be hoped the Ass. will by then have
replaced the Cits, by some less effete organisation,

Saturday also witnessed a scrimmage on
the Fitzroy (Vic.) ground between two Soccer learns
claiming to represent N.S.W. and Vic. Ma had
seven Australians in her eleven, Victoria only one,
and the latter combination's dialects were as numer-
ous an( j varied as the players. Still, they used their
f ee t a nd heads (physically as well as otherwise) to
better purpose than the Cornstalks, and though the
i a tt e r had scored two goals to one long before half-
time, they could put on no more, whereas the
Geordie-Cocknev-Zomerzedshire-Victorian agglomera-
tion a dded two, leaving it with three goals to Ma’s
pa ji- a t the finish. At which the victors adjured the
v j c tim« to “Beer up, lod ; beer up. Thee’ll do better
next time, an’ Ah divven care whae knaws it.”

Sydney Lacrosse semi-finals on Saturday
last were extra °ne-sided maelstroms, in the midst
of which the hitherto invincible Petersham, which
has monopolised the premiership for the last four
years, went down before the all-conquering Eastern
Suburbs. ’The Wise Men from the East won by
eight goals to one, Petersham never having even a
sniff of victory at any stage of the game. The down-
fall of Birchgrove before Svdnev was even more
melancholy, the figures being 14 goals to two. Still,
Birchgrove can count it to its glory that it lifted
itself from the “B” ranks right into the “A ’ semi-
finals in its first season. Understood that Eastern
Suburbs is feeding its team on raw meat and un-
cooked brandy for the hurricane final at the end of
the current week.
The second semi-final round in Sydney
Baseball left the wild rush for the bauble in an
interesting state. Mosman-North Sydney (a com-
bination club) and Lane Cove, the top dogs in the
Competition, were smitten to the dust. Mosman-
North Sydney clashed with Leichhardt, and the
latter seemed hopelessly in the broth with six runs
to three against it. Then, like Petty-Officer Curran,
it woke up, smiled at creation generally, went to
look for Mosman-North Sydney, found it, belted
Slieol out of it, and finally won through with nine
runs to eight. On its own cabbage-patch Petersham
smote the pitchers from Lane Cove mightily and
often, and won comfortably with 10 runs to five.
Both disturbances were well patronised, for base-
ball is thriving in Sydney. The various clubs now
stand thuswise: Mosman-North Sydney 11 wins,
Lane Cove and Leichhardt 10 each, and Petersham
eight. Certainly, Leichhardt’s downing of Mosman-
North Sydney on Saturday was something to enthuse
over.

After a week or more ,of hard head toil.
Australian chess champion W. S. Viner out-moved
challenger Spencer Craekanthorp, at Bellingen,
N.S.W.* by seven games to one. A side wager of
£5O \yas entwined with the title. In 11 games,
some of which occupied six hours, the. challenger
carried off but one, and played three drawn games.
As a sporting pastime chess is as cheerful as a
funeral, but as a test of endurance, a bottomless
hole into which man may pour brain sweat and life
blood, it is worse than a lifetime of football
matches.

David Storey, M.L.A., recently requested
N.S.W. Government to eradicate the tussocks which
encumber the cricket pitches in Centennial Park
(Sydney). The flabbergasted Minister’s reply was
the matter won 1 d be looked into. The next thing
will probably be a request that the Government
should ;supply cricketing material, drinks and solid
refreshment, and tramfares, and, perhaps, a small
allowance for loss of time to the gentry who play
cricket at the Genten. in Storev’s electorate.

W. J. Hamilton, who gathered the five
mile cross-country championship of Queensland re-
cently, has a consistent record in that momentous
event. In the past four years Hamilton has won the
title in 1911 and 1913, and filled second place to
T. J. Wood in 1912, and J. Ryan, in 1910. There
appears- to be sufficient spring remaining in his hind
legs to make him a prickly pear in future struggles.
The Australian jockey Club (Sydney)
has removed the big jumps at Randwick, and sub-
stituted brush-topped hurdles. The innovation may
not cause cross-country jockeys to attain old age,
but it will certainly save the neck and back of many
a good horse and the limbs of some indifferent
human weeds. Therefore it should he highly appre-
ciated. The horses are worth saving, anyhow.
A fight has been arranged between Patrick
Bradley and Dave Smith, to take place on the even-
ing of Saturday. September 13, at the Sydney Sta-
dium. It should be a mightily interesting event, as
the men are excellent boxers and hard fighters. Like-
wise it should prove about the hardest scrap either
of them has had in this country.
* * * *
With the taking over of the King William-
street Stadium in Adelaide Reg Baker will have
established a fine long circuit, which should keep
his horde of mercenaries in fairly regular work.
Brisbane, Toowoomba, Sydney, Melbourne and Ade-
laide are now all blessed with Baker Stadiums. A
valued correspondent remarks anent the missionary
work in Adelaide: “Of course, Mr. Baker may make
money, but at present I do not know any other
fight promoters in our village who have their dia-
monds out of pawn. The biggest house of recent
years was probably at Hughie Mehegan’s annihila-
tion of James Armstrong, when about £3OO was
swallowed at the box office. The takings might have
fieen greater had it been generally known that one
of the pair had loaned his glad rags and crush hat
to a local belle, who wore them to the fight, and sat
in the corner of the gentleman whose clothes she
inhabited.”
The scrap between Rill Dang and ex-Petty
Officer Curran, at Sydney Stadium last week, filled
that building Wry comfortably. It was a house to
make glad the heart of the management. Judging
by the way these two had-beens raked in the people,
the Australian public is found “not guilty” of the
charge of forgetting its sometime pets. Lang is a
lucky man. The fight presented two remarkable
spectacles: The first was the great demonstration of
friendliness towards referee Arthur Scott when he en-
tered the ring. It rose and fell and rose again like the
white forelock of the ocean on a rocky coast. Satur-
day fortnight the occupants of the same seats were
howling for Scott’s innards. Evidently trust in
democracies is as futile as faith in princes. The
other and more remarkable feature of the upheaval
was the frequent somnolence of the officer. He often
seemed almost too indolent to remain alive without out-
side assistance. He is apparently suffering from a sub-
acute form of sleeping sickness, or he is the most
indolent and bedridden circumstance that ever got
into a boxing ring. Yet he had a bright moment,
just as a dog has his day. He was wide awake
when the gong went for the first round, and he
charged Lang with a bound. All in a moment the
Australian was bashed, walloped and biffed right
across the ring to the north-east corner, where he
found himself sitting amid the ropes as the result
of a shower of blows about the body, blows of which
each one seemed to be laden with all the tenderness
of the kick of an infuriated mule. It seemed as if
general post offices were falling on Lang. When
Curran got going again, he immediately flew off the
handle some more, and would undoubtedly have done
something hideous had not a smash- on th,e jaw from
the right of the terrified antagonist, assisted by the
officer’s own elephantine rush, had a soothing effect
on his ferocity. He fell asleep on the spot, but con-
tinued to stroll about the ring, carrying Lang round
his neck most of the time. He slept soundly for
two whole rounds, and carried Lang several miles
while walking in his dreams. It is not true that he
snored in his corner, but the varlet who handled the
bottles from which be was refreshed had to insert
the nozzle of the utensil in Curran’s mouth and tilt
the southern end of it slowly upwards while the
officer wet his whistle. Sometimes he drank stuff
that might have been either milkless tea or flat beer
out of a colorless bottle, and sometimes he imbibed
some suspicious liquid that looked horribly like plain
water out of a smaller bottle. His corner drinkery
was a depressing spectacle.
Curran’s somnolence became chronic. He was all
the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus rolled into one—those
Sleepers whose names were Johannes Smithianus,
Gift, Trump, High..Jbow, Jack and the Game. He
recalled the story of “When the Sleeper Wakes,” only
he didn't till it was too late. Sometimes he sug-
gested the dead man who was hypnotised and kept
talking in his corpse -according 'to one of Poe’s
horrors. He loafed and dreamed throughout every
round till Lang placed a shower of blows fit to have
embittered an elenhant all over his dial. Then
Curran would think he heard something like a door
closing in the distance, and would slowly wake up,
smile at Lang, smile at the audience, and remember
he had a fight on hand. So he would start to look
for Lang, who was usually making a great pace; but
if he wasn’t going fast enough the officer would
obligingly carry him round the ring a few times.
Lang had the longer reach, and the officer was
thoroughly imbued with the idea that to score he
must make his opponent lead, and then get inside
the blow, and either cross or rip to the body. So he
would walk round the ring with Lang's extended fist
against his nose as the publican retreated, remark
ing, “Come on, come on, Bill!” Sometimes publican
Bill would bang and clinch, and sometimes he would
rush into an embrace without bothering about the
formality of hitting first. It was wildly humorous
for a time, but at last it grew monotonous. Whole
rounds passed without the officer getting a single
blow home or making any attempt at one, for he
took long to uncoil himself, and Lang managed fre-
quently to embrace him before he could let go
But when Curran did hit he hurt ; and Lang was a
very scared gladiator. The crowd grew weary, and
counted them both out in chorus. Not till the' 17th
round did Curran really begin to travel, and then
he became very business-like. He went for a knock-
out. Lang was hard-pressed, but by dint of valiant
hanging on and wasting time he saw the term
through. If Curran had been his best girl, he could
not have embraced her more frequently or ardu-
ously. He clung on like the sins of youth, and early
piety wasn’t a circumstance compared to him. Still
it was the right game to play, and it won him the
fight, for when the final gong sounded Arthur Scott
at once placed his hand and benediction on Lang’s
head. The officer was beaten on points. Come to
think of it, when the retired naval officer gets up
against the publican he generally loses on points,
and so it was on this' occasion.
The Wells-Levy objection to Arthur Scott
as referee in the Mehegan-Wells scrap is the sort of
thing that is calculated to drive the thoughtful
soul to lemon squash. Why Australian promoters
and so forth should put up with this sort of thing
is beyond all understanding, for such an objection
is nothing less than a straight intimation that the
Stadium management doesn't know its own business,
and that though any old referee may do for the
common Australian scrapper the imported article
requires something very different. The only amaz-
ing thing is that the gentlemen didn’t demand that
Eugene Corri or some other National Sporting Club
panjandrum or pet should be shot across by wireless,
regardless of cost, to adjudicate on the momentous
battle. Brother Levy, the son of Abraham, manager
for Wells, objected to Scott, probably the son of
Donald Macbeth, on the ground that he, Levy, the
descendant of Melchisedec, feared that Scott had
not the confidence of a section of the public. No
referee who does his' work fearlessly and conscien-
tiously ever has the confidence of the whole of the
public. Nor has any other referee. In the eyes of
someone every decision on points is wrong. The
only indisputable verdict is a knock-out —at least
it is seldom disputed except on a foul. But it is
not always the best fighter or the best boxer that
scores the knock-out. And unless there is a knock-
out the referee loses the confidence of a large section
of the public every time. Yet nothing would satisfy
Levy, the son of Solomon, who was the father of
Rehoboam, than that his promoter, Baker, should
put himself into the position in which, on the face
of it, he was bound to lose the confidence of a heap
of his patrons. And lose it he did. Temporarily,
perhaps, and perhaps not. Tt was an unfair position
to put Baker in, and the iniquity of it has driven
many of Baker’s best friends to eating speckled
fruit and drinking milk shake.
The cream of the joke is that, had Levy and Wells
arrived here just after the great Langford-McVea
fight, when Baker was the Stadium referee, Levy, oh
the same line of argument, would have howled like
all the sons of Belial against the man he insisted on
last week. Just at that time it was the Baker blood
the dissatisfied section of the public were howling
for because he gave what he considered to be a true
and faithful verdict. All referees, according to some-
one, make mistakes —barring Mclnstoush, and he
only refereed one fight in which one man —Burns —
was donkev-licked from start to finish. All the rest,
including the first and greatest of referees, Jehovah,
the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, have given
unpopular decisions, in the eyes of people who didn’t
know any better. Consider the verdict that Saul got
at Gilboa, where the farmer-king was routed. Think
what a huge section of the public, including every-
one named Levy, must have disagreed with the ver-
dict in the final of the championships series between
Samson and the Philistines. And to this dav the
announcement that Pharaoh Necho dog-walloped
Josiah on points at Megiddo arouses Hebrews to bit-
terness almost as great as that over the verdict
Titus obtained over John of Gischala at Jerusalem
(a.d. 70). But the list of unpopular decisions is
interminable. A man named Levy is the last who
should object to any referee. It should be in his
blood that no such ‘ thing as an infallible referee
exists, or ever did exist, or ever can.

In spite of the brilliant promises made,
the effort to revive the Bathurst-Sydney (N.S.W.)
Road Cycle Race has failed. So this one-time popu-
lar road race will remain as dead as ever, for this
year at least. The distance is 133| miles, and the
record (7hr. 24min. lOsec.) was established by F.
D. Wdlcott, of N.S.W., on September 3, 1909.
* * * *
The little Cycle-Car is beginning to make
itself felt as a factor in the motoring world. H.
Davies recently drove one of these little Dunlop-shod
contraptions from Land’s End (England) to John o'
Groats,’ House (Scotland) in 34hr. 39min. The
distance is 890 miles, so the average speed worked
out at nearly 26 miles an hour. The excellence of
the performance will be realised when it is remem-
bered that the record for this classic course is 29hr.
12min., or less than 31 miles an hour. There is
an, awful difference between the performance and the
cost of the cars and the respective upkeeps.

My Health Exercises Permanently Cure Indigestion.
Indigestion is NOT caused by the food you eat It is
purely the result of a stomach that has been ill-used—that has
been shamefully neglected—that has been allowed to rust, through
want of exercise.
Very few people overeat. If tne muscles of the stomach are
of normal strength, your food will give you every particle of
its nourishing qualities.
My Health Exercises, for banishing indigestion, quickly build
up and strengthen the muscles which govern the stomach—make
them easily able to assimilate the food—give nourishment to
every part of the body. Be guided by the experience of others
who’ve benefited.
Read these excellent reports:—
“Your exercises have done me a lot of good. I feel
much stronger in every way. and get better health. I
used to suffer from indigestion, but have not been
troubled for some time now.”
J.R.K., Wallendbeen, N.S.W.
“Those last lot of exercises have banished all the
aches and pains of indigestion, of which I had a terribly
bad attack the week before I received your last letter.”
A.J.W., Hobart, Tasmania.
If you’re dyspeptic there’s a rapid, permanent and natural
cure now waiting for you to apply it. What my Health Exer-
cises have done for others, they will surely do for you. Write

A New Lease of Health,
“ The wonders brought about by this
preparation are no less manifold than
amazing.”
So writes a well-known physician in
the Medical Press and Circular one
of sixteen thousand doctors who have
testified to the value of Sanatogen in
various kinds of weakness, loss of nerve-
power, impaired digestion, brain-fag,
sleeplessness, and general weakness.
Sanatogen, the tonic food with lasting
effects, has given a new lease of health
to more than a million sufferers, in-
cluding many of the most distinguished
people in the land.
Nerve Power Restored.
The reason for Sanatogen’s/ great
efficacy in nervous disorders has been
pointed out by no less an authority than
Sir Charles A. Cameron, C. 8., M.D.,
Public Analyst of Dublin, who states:
“ Sanatogen is an excellent nerve food,
containing a large amount of organic
phosphorus in exactly the form in which
it can be easily absorbed.”
But Sanatogen does more than revivify
the nervous system. It also builds up
the muscular tissues and has a beneficial
effect upon every organ of tiie body.

“ I have watched the effects of Sanatogen upon persons suffering

Philadelphia Jack O’Brien, legally J. F.
A. Hagan, sometime champion heavyweight of the
world, lawyer, real estate agent anil operator and
author, a man who in his day kicked up consider-
able dust, is up the spout. Ten years ago he had
£40,000 to his credit, to-day he is £lB,OOO short
of the sum required to meet his liabilities. It wasn’t
drink, neither was it swift damsels nor dilatory
horses. It was the great desire to get very .rich' very
quickly ; and wild gambles in real estate that smashed
the fortunes of the most handsome bruiser the
Yankee ring has known of late years.
N.S.W. League of Wheelmen is far from
falling into the teeth of the official liquidator. It
pushes off in the coming season with a member-
ship pf 23 clubs, representing 652 members. But
it is the financial side that makes the merry smile
to beam over the official face, for whereas it started
last year with a credit balance of £4l, this year
P swaggers forth with no less than £llO bulging
i ts breasjy pocket.
Ex-Australian cyclist A. J. Clark is
pressing Yankee champion Frank Kramer for the
championship of America. This distinction is decided
on points scored in a series of events during the
racing circuit; and when the last mail left Kramer
was 19 points to Clark’s 18. Kramer has held the
title for somewhere about a decade now. Cycling
seems to be a came in which age stales the_ exquisite
quality more slowly than in most cases.
While the very rich and the very mighty
are going in for freak cars that will look more like
landships than anything else, the great mass of
British motorists are demanding smaller, lighter
vehicles. The increase of motor taxation started the
movement, as the more opulent the car the higher
the tax. And then the average motorist who used
his car mostly in and around a city discovered the
lighter, smaller, lower-powered car was not only
quite good enough, but more comfortable on account
of the lessened vibration. The result is a revolution
in taste to wtreh the motor-builders have had to bow
tbeir disgusted heads.
N.S.W. Cricket Association takes off it*
coat for the coming season in a, somewhat w'orried
frame of clothes. Things are not what they might
be—far from what they ought to be, in fact. Last
year the, Association made a loss of £1513, which
reduced the cash balance to £946. And on top of
this painful development is the steady conviction
that cricket, as a spectacle, calculated to rake in
“bobs,” is losing its grip upon the pockets of the
people. The real trouble is, of course, the paucity
of, the percentage which the Association draws
from the takings of Sydney Cricket Ground. Till
that matter is placed on a more equitable basis,
under which the Association will draw something
from the subserintions of the army of members and
their women folk, it will hold a lean and hungry
purse.
It is about time Australian bowlers re-
deemed their promise, made in 1908, to send a
team to Maoriland “next season.” On one occasion
the Ma State had no less than 70 nominators for the
trip, and was merely waiting for the other States to
fall into line. Apparently the mass scared the
other States off with the fear that the whole 70 might
go and the team be swamped with Ma Staters. So
the drift has gone on ; every year team would be
sent “next season” ; and when next season has arrived
the team hasn’t. South Aus. is anparently willing
to send representatives, so why not let a team of
Cornstalks and Croweaters go forth and redeem the
long overdue promise ?
Adelaide sportsmen are thankful for one
small mercy, and hopeful of a big one. Gawler
racecourse now has a railway siding at its back door,
so that the City contingent will no longer have to
swear at passing right alongside of the course into
the town only to walk or drive back again. And last
week, Premier Peake, opening a new yacht clubhouse
at Glenelg, promised that the boat harbor there shall
be put in hand at once. The Price Government once
got so far as to put in a few piles, but nothing more
was done, and any sudden blow is still apt to drive
anything in the open roadstead to destruction on the
beach.
Stakes in South Aus. during the year just
finished have been, as usual, well cut up among own-
ers. Adelaide and Birthday Cups both went to
inter-State visitors. R. M. Hawker won most races,
but J. James —with Lord Alwyne, Puringa and a
good string—took most money, £2734. There were
eight whose cheques ran to over four figures; and
among the doctors, squatters, sharebrokers, and so
on who like to have a horse or two in training,
there were another 50 who took from £3OO to £BOO
towards expenses. James, who does his own train-
ing, was headed by M'Cann in this division ; Patter-
son a good third. Of the jockeys, Biglands had
most rides (149), but Hopwood and Bax both tied
with him for winning mounts (19). Pistol stands
out all by himself in South Aus. as a sire, with 27
winners, 62 races, and £B5OO in stakes. Maltster and
Wallace are a very bad second and third.
“J. ,T. Miller’s Sporting Pamphlet” for 1913
is the same old invaluable book of reference for
soring punters, and -even a little more so than usual.
The performances of all the entrants for the Metro-
politan, Caulfield Cup and Melbourne Cup are stated
under their respective names, and the four-footed
winners of all the big turf events and two-footed
champions in every branch of human sporting en-
deavor are duly catalogued. New features are the
results of last vear’s Cups, giving a list of the
starters and their market prices. A lovely portrait
of Sol Green adorns the back cover of the book,
which can be procured for a bob from the J. J.
Miller Publishing Co., Post Office Place, Melbourne.
J. A. Panton, who sat for so many years
in the Criminal Division of the frowsy old
Melbourne City Police Court, is now almost
blind, and, when he ventures into the city,
has to be guided through the streets. He
and the late Judge Casey were old chums
and cronies, and in his will the latter left
his friend all his choice wines. There were
not many men in Australia who had a nicer
taste in wine than Casey.
“The Religious Editor” ; What an animal
is Man! Consider how he feeds. For
months —perhaps for years—he pads relig-
iously to the same restaurant or pie-shop,
and eats out of the same waitress’s hand.
His, chair is reserved for him, and if any
unmannerly hog takes it, he goes on as if
someone had stolen his home from him. He
is the apple of his handmaiden’s eye, and
she gets to know his surname, and talks to
him on the subject he likes best. As well as
handing him his food, she hovers over him
devotedly, and studies just how much flirta-
tion he likes with his steak. Everything in
the garden is perfectly satisfactory. The
house has its regular customer; the waitress
has a friend who is more like a visitor than
a customer; and the customer has a waitress
who is more like a pet nurse than a mere
bringer of food. Then one day the whole
caboose palls on the regular and devoted
customer, and he comes no more to his re-
versed chair. The bereaved waitress goes
round amongst her customers asking drearily
if they know what has happened to the ab-
sent one ; and the proprietor looks over the
screen at the vacant place with a wildly
unhappy expression. And all the time the
loyal customers chew in stern silence and
never let on that the deserter is going fur-
tively to another place, and getting himself
adopted by another waitress with different
colored hair. When taxed with his crime he
mutters that the food in the old place is
“going off.” Actually the food is the same
—and the deserter knows it. But he isn’t
game to admit that he has tired of it and
has gone off, like the free buffalo that he is,
to sample a fresh feeding-ground.
“Lucifer” speaks a brief howl from Mel-
bourne :
Federal Parliament House is the last possibility
in dishevelled construction. All styles, from the
Gothic to the Tommyrotic, are involved in its ex-
ternal design, and all forms of material, from stone
to tin, declare their presence in its demented im-
mensity. Front and back it is decorated preten-
tiously, but in the middle it has the stern appearance
of a gaol, with additions by a marine-store merchant.
Seen from one aspect, the House is a mixture of
palace and cowshed, patched with bricks and sun-
dries, and topped by bewildered tin chimneys and
incongruous air pipes. The interior is just as bad ;
and when the unhappy visitor wanders into its maze
of tunnels, passages and catacombs, the last storing
records and air that have been dead for eternities,
he wonders whether he has bumped into the two
ends and middle of an architect’s nightmare. Also,
he dimly guesses that he has struck something
special in antique atmospheres; for when rats perish
among the archives, as they occasionally do, the in-
cense would make even an onion feel faint and cause
garlic to pant.
The Department of Justice in N. S.
Wales has a regular visitor with whom it
will part for a very small consideration. She
is an old lady with a gamp—and a griev-
ance, and she calls at the town residence of
Justice every day in search of the gentle-
man. If she had her rights she would be
the owner of a considerable slice of sub-
urban Sydney, and a millionairess; but, as
usual, the right owners keep her out of the
estate, and are battening and bloat-
ing on their own legal property. The
imprisonment of these persons and sundry
others who have made false declarations,
forged deeds, uttered counterfeit coin, and
in various ways delayed justice is what she
requires ; and the Department doesn’t know
exactly what to do with her. Mostly she
is informed that some official who happens
to be aosent for the day or away on leave
has her matter in hand; whereupon, after
stating her case to the messenger for the
1114th time, and denouncing various people
as scoundrels, she departs. Latterly there
has been growing up within her a strong
suspicion that some of the officials are in
the pay of her enemies; and one recent day,
meeting one of them —the one to whom she
habitually refers as “the handsome scoun-
drel” —she chased him with a business-like
umbrella along several corridors and up
and down a few stairways. Since then
there has been a surprising growth in the
number of officials who are officially “out”
when the excitable claimant makes her
daily visit, demanding the immediate resto-
ration of the imperial crown, also the
goods, gauds and regalia.
From Johannesburg:—
The old Dutch element in the Transvaal is chuck-
ling down to the soles of its boots. It remembers
that when Dr. Jameson, the Rhodesian filibuster
made his ridiculous raid, the main grievance, voiced
in every jingoistic column, was that “under ’Kruge-
there was not freedom of speech.” Jameson failing
the war followed. Now the old Boers note that
the upholders of free speech have been prohibiting
meetings in Jo’burg, and have actually called out
British troops to prevent them. Make no
mistake about it (I speak as one who came to this
country with the troops and fought right through
on the British side), the young Dutch element, no
less than the old, retains a national hatred
of the khaki, and in the Jo’burg trouble it tore
into the military unarmed. What will happen when
after some years of compulsory training, every per-
son is in possession of a rifle, ammunition and ac-
coutrements ! It is the knowledge of what is likelv
to happen to the Union Jack even now that makes
the authorities regard an industrial disturbance on
the Rand as something much more serious than an
ordinary strike.
The Victorian policeman is a wonderful
person. Lately the remains of an old man
were found in the bush near Lilydale. He
had been shot twice, and most of his head
was blown off. There was no weapon near
at hand, but a single-barrelled gun was
found carefully concealed some 30yds. away.
At first the force had “suspicions of foul
play.” Later it “rejected the theory of sui-
cide,” especially as the body had evidently
been “dragged some distance by the ankles.”
Now a dead man seldom hides his gun
30yds. away or drags himself about by the
ankles. So this portentous decision seems
reasonable. But has the force considered
that the deceased might have foundered at
sea, or perished by dandruff, simony,
ohampetry, atheism, frostbite or bigamy?
All these matters, likewise the chance that
he was bitten by a lion, should be looked
into.
The Macs were in full blast at the self-
righteous toon of Sale (Vic.) last week.
Sale celebrated the jubilee of its borough-
hood. and rejoiced in the fact that whereas
some other places had boomed and faded
within 50 years, nothing exciting or dis-
respectable had ever happened to itself dur-
ing that long period. “Stability, not Ac-
tivity” is the motto of Sale. Snobbery
oozes from its every pore, and the only
song that reaches its proud Gippsland
heart is “Auld Lang Syne.” A joint mes-
sage from Roderick McAlister, Alex.
Thompson and Donald McLean arrived on
the morning of the local outburst: —
We, the descendants of the glorious band of High-
landers and Scotsmen who did the early pioneering
work of Gippsland and laid the foundation of Sale
and centres, offer the people of Sale hearty con-
gratulation on the attainment of the jubilee.
Senator McColl assured the ancient aristo-
cracy of the long surviving district that
theirs was “a goodly country, settled by a
goodly people, by the cream of the British
race, and that was the Scotch.” After
which the little rift within the bagpipes
was made by Senator Blakey, who remarked
that notwithstanding the vaunted progress
of Sale the population of the county of
Tanjil had decreased by 354 during the
last 10 years, and the next generation
would have to do better than its prede-
cessors. Sale is still wondering whether
Senator Blakey meant to imply that the
bonnie little toon is a centre of stagnation
and a hot-bed of clannishness.

This Company has been formed for the purpose of acquiring and working by bucket
dredges tin-bearing lands at Kamunting, in the State of Perak, Federated Malay States.
SITUATION. —The property is situated about three miles from Taiping, the capital
of Perak. The main trunk railway from Singapore to Penang passes close to the pro-
perty, and the main macadamised arterial road down the Malay Peninsula forms one of
the boundaries of the property for one and a half miles of its length.
TITLES AND AREA.— With the exception of an area of sixty acres, in the lease
of which there are certain special conditions, the land is held under the usual renewable
mining leases granted by the Government of Perak upon the ordinary terms of rent and
export duty payable to the Government. The total area, including the beforementioned
sixty acres, is about 402 acres. The special conditions before referred to are particu-
larised in the report of Mr. A. W. Freeman, published herewith, and are not of an
onerous character. As will be seen from the reports and boring plan hereto attached,
the property has been most thoroughly and carefully prospected. The boring operations
were.carried out under the general supervision of Mr. T. W. Horton, with whom were
associated Messrs. R. L. Naish, W. Bethune, L. V. Prentice and W. Murray, all highly
experienced in the prospecting and valuation of alluvial mining properties.
In addition to the report by Mr. A. W. Freeman there are published herewith reports
by Mr. M. T. Nelmes Bluck, C.E., M.1.E.5., M.I. Mech. E., late General Manager of the
Tongkah Harbour Tin Dredging Company, and by Messrs. T. W. Horton, R. L. Naish
and W. Bethune. It will be seen that the property has been proved by 324 bores to
contain an area of 354 acres of payable land of an average depth of 30ft. of an average
value of 1.251 b. per cubic yard of tin oxide, assaying 70 per cent, metallic Tin (equal to
an average of 1.211 b. dressed up to 72.5 per cent.), the 384 acres to a depth of 30ft.
representing not less than 18,000,000 cubic yards of material extremely suitable for
bucket dredging and estimated to return, with metallic tin at £2OO per ton and operating
with two dredges, each of a capacity of 80,000 cubic yards per month, a profit) of not
less than £750,000, to be recovered in ten years.
EXTRACTS FROM MR. BLUCK’S REPORT.
“NATURE OF THE MATERIAL. —The general character of the whole of the
material is a sandy gravel, with here and there a little clay and a few small stones, in
fact, just barely sufficient stiff material to make the tailings stack behind the dredge.
The bottom is excellent for dredging, being a soft pipeclay, and is fairly level, as the
boring results show'. The average dredging depth is about 30 feet.”
“WATER SUPPLY. —There is ample water everywhere, a fair-sized river running
through the property, besides a considerable amount of soakage and surface water from
the frequent rains, the locality being one subject to the wettest weather in the Peninsula.
The water is, of course, fresh, and suitable for boiler feed purposes. For paddock water
there is abundance, which can easily be maintained at any desired reasonable level.”
“TIN CONTENTS.-—I am indebted to the staff of the Austral Malay Tin Ltd.
for all information on this head. Their boring operations have been very complete in
themselves, and the system of checking employed, which is excellent, places beyond a
doubt the substantial accuracy of their results. The tin is distributed from top to
bottom in varying proportions. The average for the whole area of 384 acres is 1.211 b.
of oxide per cubic yard, of an assay value of 73 per cent, to 74 per cent, metallic tin.
While the average dredging depth is 30 feet a practical maximum can be considered at
4-> feet. The tin is of good quality, fine, but not so fine as tin I have seen coming from
o'her mines in the vicinity, which they easily save. There is, therefore, every reason to
expect as good a recovery from a dredge as there is from the bores, and no doubt a
marketable product of 73 per cent, will be produced. I was able, by examining open
cast mines in the immediate neighborhood, to form the conclusion that all the information
given me about the tin contents and nature of the ground is correct.”
‘‘METHOD OF WORKING.— The foregoing description of the property will at
once indicate that bucket dredging is the most economical method to employ to recover
the tin. There is sufficient room for two, possibly for three, dredges, each with a capacity
of 80,000 cubic yards per month, with, say, buckets of 7 cubic feet capacity each.”
“COSTS.— The working costs, including all charges on the Eastern area, will come
below per cubic yard, and on the Western area below sd. per cubic yard.”
“ESTIMATE OF PROFITS. —There is about 18,500,000 cubic yards of dredgeable
material in the leases, which on the bore results prospect on an average 1.211 b. of oxide,
of say 73 per cent, tin assay value per cubic yard. After providing for the F.M.S. tin
duty, reasonable smelting charges, working expenses, amortization of capital, incidentals,
reclamation of small area as mentioned, etc., there is left a total profit of well over
£750,000 in the area.”
“LlFE.— With one dredge, not allowing for any stoppages, there is a life of 20
years, or allowing for 25 per cent, lost time, a life of 25 years. With more dredges the
life would be correspondingly reduced and the profits increased, since the output would
be greater in proportion to the standing charges.”
“SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION. —You have a large area, all dredgeable,
moderate depth, abundant water, convenient situation, and good topographical features,
area thoroughly prospected, and good bottom. Therefore, with good machinery and
efficient management, a Company with moderate capital will pay handsome dividends to
its shareholders.”
EXTRACTS FROM MR. FREEMAN’S REPORT.
“Owing to the nearest portion of the property being distant hardly more than four
hundred yards from the railway station, the delivery of machinery, mining stores and
fuel should be more easy and cheaper than is usually the case in such undertakings, and
the prices paid for all stores should be at least 20 per cent, lower than prices ruling in
Australia.”
I “Having regard to the great area proved payable by bores, I recommend its equip-
ment in the first instance with two dredges of seven cubic feet capacity, each capable of
dredging to a depth of 45 feet, and of maintaining a mean monthly output of 80,000 cubic
yards of material.”
“Taking the working costs at per cubic yard, and tin at £2OO per ton, the profit
value of the tin to be won from the area would be, say, £BOO,OOO, or with tin at £l7O per
ton, say, £600,000, to be recovered by two dredges of the capacity named in, say, ten
years.”
“Regarded in another way, if there is assumed a monthly inclusive expenditure of
£2OOO for a total output of 81 tons of tin oxide from 150,000 cubic yards treated, there
should result at least a monthly profit of £7OOO, with tin at £2OO per ton, or £5OOO with
tin at £l7O per ton.”
“The cost of building, delivering and erecting the two dredges recommended should
not greatly exceed £40,000, which sum should be taken as including all administrative
charges up to the time th« dredges start work,”
EXTRACTS FROM MR. HORTON’S REPORT.
“If any error has been made the mine must be richer, not poorer, than our calculation.'
indicate.
“Throughout the length and breadth of the property, nothing but an ideal bedrock
for bucket dredging has been encountered.
“The railway will supply all requirements and could not have been more conveniently
situated.
“The cost of working should be lower than for any other dredging property I know.
“The material to be dredged is so free from clay that the maximum efficiency may
be expected, and, the gangue being light, the tin will be easily saved.
“The actual work of boring was carried out by five gangs of coolies, each under the
direct supervision of European assistants, and in my opinion as an examiner of mining
properties, the work has been more thoroughly and systematically carried out than in any
tin proposition ever placed before the Australian public.”
EXTRACTS FROM MR. NAISH’S REPORT.
“For the past three and a half years, having been boring and generally examining
alluvial properties all over the Malay Peninsula, I am naturally familiar with all present
methods of prospecting and valuation in this country, and can say that no property in
Malaya has had the same extreme care expended on its valuation as this. There has
been no weak link in the chain of operations ; everything, from the taking of samples on
the field to the checking of final figures, has been done on lines that permitted of the
best principles of sampling and mine valuation being adhered to.
“The outstanding features of your property as a bucket dredging concern are:—
“Exceptionally large area.
“Assured tin contents.
“Unexcelled position of the property economically.
“Assured and plentiful water supply.
“Ideal nature of the ground.
“Soft, even bottom.”
EXTRACTS FROM MR. BETH LINE’S REPORT.
“The character of the material throughout the property is the same—a free, loose
wash.
“The tin recovered in boring is of good quality, dressing up to about 72 per cent,
metallic, and most of it is so coarse as to be readily saved in the boxes. I found, on
making some grading tests on the tin, that 20 per cent, would pass through an 80-mesh
sieve, and consequently made it my business to procure a sample of tin actually saved in
practice on a large producing mine in the neighborhood. I found, on grading this
sample, that as much of it as 26 per cent, would pass an 80-mesh sieve, and am therefore
of opinion that a dredge will save all the tin saved in boring. In fact, I should almost
expect a better recovery, as I am certain that some tin was lost in washing the samples
which would be saved in sluice boxes.
“I have no hesitation in expressing the opinion that you have an excellent bucket
dredging proposition, which should yield immense profits.”
Mr. J. S. Henry, the Company’s Constructing Engineer, late General Manager of
the Tongkah Compound Coy., and who designed and erected the dredge which has operated
so successfully for that Company, has already in hand the preparation of plans and
specifications for two dredges, each of a capacity of 80,000 cubic yards per month, and it
is anticipated that the Directors will be in a position, shortly after the closing of the
subscription list, to invite tenders for the construction of the Company’s dredging plant.
DIRECTORS’ OPINION.
The Directors have no hesitation in accepting the reports and estimates above
referred to, and they believe that the undertaking cannot fail to be a very profitable one.
The ore reserves and values have been so well proven by the borings, the "margin between
cost and value per yard is so large, and the conditions for economic exploitation are so
favorable that there should be an absence of the risks usually associated with mining
enterprise.

Public Opinion and
Beale High-grade Pianos.
. , ickland, Gcnernor of X.S.W., accompanied by his staff, paid a vist to our factories recently. His Excellency expressed surprise
at the magnitude of our works, and was greatly pleased with the quality of our instruments.
oiizontal Piano has been for some time in the State Government House, Sydney, and gives every satisfaction to the vice-
regal inmates.
Everywheie they are in use Beale Pianos have won the highest recognition for their musical and lasting qualities. This is simply because
Beale Pianos possess all the improvements found in the best makes of modern pianos, and, in addition, they have patent features—such as our
steel tuning system—which are not obtainable in any other pianos.
Many eminent men, in every walk in life, have recorded their appreciation of our instruments, and we give below the opinions of a few.
HERR WILHELM GANZ, one of the best-known men in the musical
world of London, played on our pianos at the Franco-British Exhibition, and
afterwards sent us the following purely voluntary testimonial:—
“It gives me great pleasure to state that I consider the Grand Pianoforte
which you exhibited at the Franco-British Exhibition a very first-rate instru-
ment. I much enjoyed playing on the same. The touch is excellent, likewise the
tone. I especially admired the wonderful tone of the bass. In fact, I hardly
remember a pianoforte with a more resonant sound, and Australia may be very
proud of your having produced such a fine instrument. With every good wish
for your success in the production of these pianofortes, I remain, yours very
faithfully, Wilhelm Ganz.”
(At the Franco-British Exhibition, London, 1908, Beale Pianos were
awarded Grand Prise and three Gold Medals.)
THE HON. T. WADDELL, ex-State Treasurer, New South Wales: —
“I heartily wish success to Beale & Co., Ltd., in their great manufacturing
enterprise. They deserve every encouragement that can be given them. It is to
enterprising men such as those connected with this firm that we must look to
find profitable employment for our own people, and to push the country ahead.”
HIS EMINENCE THE LATE CARDINAL MORAN, Archbishop of Sydney:
“I have had great pleasure in visiting Messrs. Beale & Co.’s grand centre of
industry at Annandale, and in congratulating them on the magnificent example
they have set of enlightenment and energy.” His Eminence also said : “We must
all, I am sure, rejoice in the wonderful development of industry such as has
been demonstrated by this institution. It has been a revelation to me. I take
this opportunity of testifying my admiration of the work of Messrs. Beale & Co.
I had no idea that in the musical department such perfection had been attained.
I am delighted that such beautiful instruments as those we have seen and heard
are produced in Australia for the cultivation of music, and we must all wish
Messrs. Beale & Co. continued success —a success they undoubtedly deserve.”
THE HON. SIR ARTHUR RUTLEDGE, K.C.M.G., ex-Attorney-General, Q.:
“I have been much astonished and delighted to witness the operations of an
industry that is rich in promise for the prosperity of New South Wales.” Sir
Arthur also said : “That which interested me most, as I thoroughly understand
the subject, is the apparatus and system for seasoning timber. Not merely is
the timber exposed to the air, under cover, for years, but, above all, the perfect
method of uniform extraction of the sap without injuring the fibres, will enable
the wood to resist all climatic influences. It is the only perfect system I have
met with in Australia, and I was not aware until to-day that it existed amongst
us. Messrs. Beale & Co. are enabled to use in Australia patents for timber
seasoning which are elsewhere exclusive. Hence the complete success.”
COMMANDER WILLIAM J. COLQUHOUN, Commonwealth Naval Forces:—
“The extent and importance of this manufactory has been a revelation to
me, and the proprietors may be justly proud of the result of their energy and
enterprise. From what I have seen of the methods of manufacture, I believe the
Beale Pianos are just the instruments to retain all their fine qualities in all
climates where severe and rapid changes are frequent, and I think they must be
successfully introduced into India, China and Japan.”
THE HON. SIR WILLIAM J. LYNE, K.C.M.G., ex-Minister for Customs,
Commonwealth of Australia :
“The example Messrs. Beale & Co. have set by employing Australian labor
and skill in turning out the highest grade of artistic work deserves all possible
recognition. Having personally witnessed the manufacture of the parts of their
pianos, I cannot speak too strongly as to their excellent quality.”
THE LATE HON. E. W. O’SULLIVAN, Minister of Public Works, N.S.W.: —
“I consider it the duty of every citizen of the Commonwealth who can afford
it to purchase an Australian-made piano. Messrs. Beale & Co.’s pianos being
of the very best description, and, for our climate, superior to any imported, all
who intend purchasing a piano should show their patriotism by giving preference
to the Australian-made article.”
By our method of selling direct from factory to user we save you all the usual agents and middlemen s profits.
We have always on hand a number of good second-hand pianos, taken in part payment of Beale I ianos.

What a difference stropping makes!
Only those who have used an Auto Strop in comparison
with a non-stropping safety can tell just how much difference
there is—not only in the smooth, close shave which the
sharp stropped blade of an Auto Strop ensures, but in the
simplicity of its use also.
It takes far less time to strop an Auto Strop blade (and so keep it in the pink of condition)
than to put a new blade into a non-stropping safety razor. The Auto Strop is the only razor
that strops itself and consequently
SAVES CONSTANT EXPENSE FOR BLADES.

Auto Strop Safety Razor, one dozen
improved rust-proof “ Valet ” blades,

“Big Ben—the clock of the hour”
THE traditional pic-
ture of an alarm
clock is that of a
flimsy looking affair
that either rings like a
fire gong or tinkles while
you sleep on.
And the modern conception
is that of BIG BEN —a watch-
like, sturdy, long-lived sleep-
meter that calls you gradually
but promptly and calls until
you’re wide awake.
Big Ben stands 7 inches tall;
he is mounted in a thin model
case, massive, well poised and
triple plated. His face is frank,
open, easy to read —his keys
large, strong, easy to wind —
his voice clear, sunny , pleasant
to hear. It wakes you just
when you want, and either way
you want —with a continuous
five-minute ring, or with a
half-minute signal every other
minute for all of ten minutes.
Big Ben is made in La Salle,
Illinois, U.S A., by Westclox. His
price is 12/6, postage 1/- extra. If
you cannot find him in your town,
send a money order to the makers’
Australian office, Westclox, 63 Pitt
Street, Sydney. They will have
One mailed to you by the nearest
jeweller.

While the mothers get worn out and haggard
For they find it too hot to sleep.

IN BANANA LAND
Characteristic Elkington notice displayed
in the Brisbane Health office: “Gentlemen
will not spit. Others must not. Penalty
£2O. Spitting is a murderous and filthy
habit. Every decent citizen is asked to aid
in suppressing it.”
To the long list of J’s.P. Bananaland
Home Department recently received a nomi-
nation which turned out to be that of a
female school-teacher. But why not? The
only trouble is about a name for her. “Jus-
ticess x>f the Peace?” “Justice of the
Peacess?” “Magistratess?” “Mrs. Honor-
arium?” And then hear the police court
lawyer: “Your Mrs. Washup, I appear for
the defendant?”
The Denham proposal to abolish the
present system under which the returning
officer initials each ballot paper brings to
mind the circumstances which gave the sys-
tem birth in Queensland. In the election of
1868, what time the West Moreton bunch
of six used to make and unmake Ministries,
George ThoTn headed the Conservatives for
that district and was fighting Paddy O’Sul-
livan and two Radical pals. At Ilelidon
Thorn’s committee pitched its official tent
within a few yards of the polling booth, and
managed to get a paper the color and size
of the ballot-paper. Armed with this, John
Doe entered the polling-booth, received his
ballot-paper, which he pocketed when he
went to mark it, dropped the bogus paper
into the box, brought the clean ballot-paper
to the committee and received £1 in ex-
change. Then the committee marked the
paper the right way, handed it to an elector,
who in return for £1 was to drop the mani-
pulated paper into the box and bring out a
clean ballot-paper—C.O.D. So it went on
until, it was alleged, 41 persons had “voted.”
O’Sullivan lost by 36 votes; but there was
such a howl about it that the initialled
papers made their appearance for the next
contest.
Hulton Sams, the fighting parson, has
put up a sort of record. At Charters
Towers he fought in the Amateur
Tournament in three divisions—light-weight,
welter-weight and middle-weight—and quali-
fied for the finals in each. In the light-
weight final he was beaten on points,
though a big wad of the public differed
from the_ referee. In the other two divi-
sions, toiling with great spirit, he scored
wins. The performance would be full of
merit for an ordinary man; for one who
battles with a Bible under his arm, so to
speak, it is tremendous.
“W. L. Blossom”; Re Queensland’s fruit
trade (B. 17/7/’lo). “A.H.” mentions ideal
soil and climate, and rail and shipping
facilities. The soil and climate are granted;
but surely “A.H.” meant rail and shipping
difficulties. The railways charge the grower
a fairly high rate, and often don’t deliver
the goods promptly; and the shipping cos.
are worse. Owing to their gradual habits the
Northern grower is obliged to pick his fruit
green, and so lessen its deliciousness, or,
picking it riper, he must chance a rotten
consignment on delivery. As to “A.H.’s”
dream that in Queensland “jackfruit, mango-
steen and pawpaw grow practically wild,”
the truth is that jackfruit is hardly known
south of Townsville, and even north of
it is not common; while, as to the mango-
steen, according to the latest (July) Agri-
cultural Journal, the only true Java
mangosteen tree in Queensland is bearing
fruit now, for the first time, at the age of
22 years. It is the sole survivor of a plant-
ing of 600 seeds in 1891. But even if those
fruits grew wild, what would it profit a man
to go to the trouble of collecting, packing and
sending them long distances, seeing that they
are such notoriously bad “carriers”?
AS OTHERS SEE US.
MRS. WAYBACK : “ ’Ere, Bill, for 'Eaven’s sake git behind me an see if my noo dress
looks like that. If yer say it does I’ll go straight ’ome at once.”
Ryan, Leader of Bananaland’s Labor
Opposition, met an exhumed specimen of
dead ghost the other day. Kessell, orating
on a measure, uncovered the fact that Ryan,
before standing for Labor, had twice waved
the variegated banner of Liberalism. There-
upon Ryan hurled “It’s a lie!” about the
premises. Kessell repeated the statement,
and the Speaker intervened. But why this
fearful frothing at the mouth over a con-
version? Both parties make millions of
speeches (more or less)_, presumably to con-
vert somebody ; yet if anybody is converted,
the _ converted person, more often than not,
denies the fact furiously, and both parties
look at him suspiciously until he has cleared
his character. In these days Saul of Tarsus
would have gone to a lot of trouble to ex-
plain that vthe story about the adventure
on the road to Damascus was a pestilent
fabrication.
“Caber” : The cry is raised once more in
Queensland, “Purify the rolls!” This means
“Rub out as many of our political enemies
as possible.” Queensland, somehow, has been
notorious for this trick. Away back in 1879,
Mcllwraith included in his Ministry John
Murtagh Macrossan and Paddy Perkins. In-
stantly the Great Liberal party, which was
mostly bossed by the class known as’“God-
fearing men.” saw the bidden hand of
Rome pushing Mac. and Queensland to-
wards perdition. So Bobby Bulcock waded
in to “purify” the rolls, and every man with
an O’ to his surname was eyed with
suspicion, and if his name didn’t drop off
the roll the elector had a steep contract to
keep it stationary. Later Bulcock made his
peace with the black labor crowd, whereunon
he let the men with the apostrophe slide,
and the rolls were “purged” of the repro-
bates who dared to whoop for a White Aus-
tralia. “Purifying” the rolls—l don’t think !
Butterflies.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Butterflies, black with a purple scroll
Like the Tyrian dye that the sea-shell
gave!
They are born of the moon-flower’s soul,
They are spawn of the spray of a rainbow
wave,
As they dip and circle round her dark head
With the saffron wing of a sunset sped.
Or the white of a petal blown astray,
Or the rosy hint of a breaking day,
Karen turns to me and asks again :
“Where do the butterflies go in the rain?”
Her foot is shod in a pearly suede
And a golden buckle mocks the sun.
What if some man’s sick heart has paid
For her glinting jewels, one by one,
Karen would laugh if you voiced surprise
Who is crowned the Queen of the Butter-
flies !
The lawn slips down to the harbor’s blue
And the harbor lips the lawn :
And slim Karen can be false and true
Between the dusk and dawn —
Where the island of virtue lies
Is a long, long flight for the butterflies’
Red hibiscus, with pollened spear,
Swings his helmet above her head.
. . . .Ah, Karen, I was bending near
To feel if your mouth was quite as red,
When I found a tear in your velvet eyes
For the brief, bright day of the butterflies!
Butterflies, born of a rose of night
(Black as the mask a lady wears),
Beckoning slyly with fingers white
Some swart lover to climb the stairs ;
Knowing well that the mask confessed
Just how frail was her heaving breast.
So they circle round Karen’s head.
Gold and purple or brown and red—
And I press her close till I blind her eyes
To the cold, grey rain on the butterflies !
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, August 16, 1913.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
The Show, with its crowds of country
people, dances, tea parties, clouds of dust,
lack of sleep and immensity of sheep, has
been, and, thank the Lord, is no more. Last
year the G.-G. Denmans and their pic-
turesque and fur-hatted gentlemen rouse-
abouts were with us, and this year your
Strickland Excellency and his eyeglass were
the foreign attractions. On Monday he
arrived, alone, save for one faithful aide.
Lady Strickland was ill, and Miss Strick-
land stayed in Sydney with her. On
day the Southern Ex. accompanied our own
dhuinewassel (as Claverhouse called him
when he said there were 9900 of him and he
was going to make trouble) to the Show
grounds. On Wednesday, when the Mac-
gregor formally opened the Show, Governor
Strickland beamed through his eyepane on
the assembled and varied multitude. The
same day, at the official luncheon, after W.
Macgregor had warned the local bull-raiser
that Argentina is cutting the Australian-
grown beef out of the world’s markets, and
mentioned the immense benefit Australia
would derive from improvements in the chilled
meat industry, Strickland broke the long
silence. Captain and Mrs. Silver, the Vision,
the Mayor and Mayoress of both North and
South Brisbane, the Speaker, Pope Cooper
and several other people of more or less
social tonnage sat at the vice-regal table
and wore the appearance of being vastly
bored between courses. The frocking was
not out of the ordinary, although the rest
of the week has been extraordinarily well
decorated in that respect.
At the dance on the Australian defender,
on Thursday, in aid of the funds
of the Creche and Kindergarten and Pre-
vention of Harshness to Beasts Associa-
tions, Governor Macgregor, Mrs: Macgregor
and daughter were in the serried ranks.
The Vision danced, but her lady mother
(please don’t make it “her lazy mother”)
contented herself with accepting a bouquet.
The Mayoress was also handed a bunch of
vegetation, and all was pleasant and polite.
The profits were not up to expectations, to
say nothing of requirements. Otherwise
there was no vulture in the ointment.
At the races on Wednesday, and again
to-day, a lot of summer frocks were worn.
Among the best-dressed women on the
crowded lawn were Mrs. J. T. Bell and
her sister, Mrs. Dalzell, of Dalgi Station.
Mrs. Forsyth, of Sydney, and her two hand-
some daughters, Mrs. Val. Macdonald and
Mrs. Jack Thomson, looked smart; and Mrs.
Ernie Baynes and daughter Mrs. Billy For-
rest were, as usual, perfectly frocked. Lady
Macgregor and the Governor entertained an
extensive and well-mannered party at after-
noon tea.
The Wattle Carnival was held to-day,
though why I don’t know, since all the
wattle worth having ceased blooming about
a month ago. Busy ladies in white frocks
and cute little ruffled yellow aprons chased
the breathless male citizen into corners, and
usually returned triumphantly clutching
metal loot in return for a wilted wattle
spray pinned to _ the victim’s coat. White
ribbon badges, with wattle blossoms printed
on them, also sold well. On the whole, the
day was a successful hold-up, although the
Art Scholarship that was wanted will have
to wait a while. Next year it is to be
hoped that Wattle Day will be celebrated at
a time when there is some fair blossom to
be had, so that the market operators will
not have to trade what appeared this year
to be the flower of seed cabbages.
The Matrons’ Ball last night was bv far
the prettiest dance of the-season. Twentv
five well-known Brisbane women acted
hostesses, and as a special distinction I SU n
pose, all wore powder and patches. Some of
them (Mrs. Ernie Baynes, Mrs. Espie Doris
and Mrs. Jack Thomson especially) looked
remarkably handsome, and none looked anv
thing but well. The hall decorations We re
palms, and red and white art muslin judi
ciously applied, with big jars of double
stock as a finishing touch. The frockine
ontfrocked any other shivoo of "the year
even the much-talked-of dance on the war-
ship Melbourne being a mere circumstance
and common frippery in comparison.
The Myosotis Assembly happened on Mon
day night, and the poor little S. B Tech
nical College strained its joints in an en-
deavor to comfortably embrace all the
guests. How anybody danced, I know nof
for there was not even room for the three’
penny-bit revolution of the backblocks. Still
all hands, to say nothing of feet, seemed to
enjoy themselves.
The Private Assembly Ball, on Thursdav
was a _ towering success. The decorations
were pink and mauve, and Mrs. J. T. Bell
who has steered the assemblies through the
season, carried a bouquet of sweet-peas of
the same shades, that had been given to her
by the committee. Dozens of country people
and several southern pilgrims were noticed
in the saraband arena. Edna Armytage and
Miss Grice, both of Melbourne, have been to
all the dances this month ; and Miss Wilkin-
son, of Sydney, is having a very good time
here.
Pretty Evelyn Kibble was married on
Tuesday evening to Hugh Walker, a t St
Thomas’ Church, Toowong. The bride
peeped out of a most exquisite gown, and
her two bridesmaids wore very uncommon
garments of and mauve ninon and
charmeuse. Papa Kibble is a very popular
man in the commercial world, and the
drummers’ association rolled up almost to a
man. President and Mrs. Bowcher, last
year’s President Meiklejohn, Mrs. Gillespie
Mr. and Miss Horton, Mr. and Mrs. Quin
Rice, and a score of others saw that no
error was made at the church, and after-
wards whirled a light and airy toe at the
Masonic Hall. The moon is being sampled
at Sydney.
Mrs. Bell, of Coochin, and her daughters
fed some dozens of acquaintances at Eschen-
hagen’s on Thursday morning. Next day
when motoring to a big tea at the same
cafe, at which Mrs. Dalzell was hostess, two
of the Bell girls were thrown out and more
or less damaged and soiled. One had her
face badlv cut.
Food distributing has been gone in for
wholesale' this week. Mrs. J. T. Bell did a
fair share on Monday, and Mrs. Donald
Fletcher, of Euralla Station, said. “Doyou-
takennlkandsugar ?” to about 20 boon com-
panions on the same day. Miss Marjorie
Robertson hostessed another party on
Thursday, in honor of Miss Wilkinson, of
Sydney; and Mrs. W. K. Dalzell, Dalgi
Station, followed suit on Friday.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Thus Treasurer Barnes, to a deputation:
“I may say I do not live by the business of
politics. I am not dependent on it. It
would not trouble me if I were out of this
chair to-morrow.” One would imagine from
such explanations that politics are a low-
dowm game, something like burglary or petty
larceny. If the “business” be so shady, why
don’t the Barneses drop it?
Minister Paget on Bananaland’s financial
outlook:
It will he a difficult matter to make both ends
meet. ... Bites are being taken out of both ends, as
it were, and a real big alligator bite is being taken
out of the middle.
Which is a cruel commentary to make on
Barnes’s monthly assurance that “a tight
hand is being kept on the Treasury.”

The Best Saddle in Australia
for the Stockman
£6llO
We have been making’ saddles for close on half a century-—and
all we know about the game has gone into the making of this
famous Stock Saddle of ours. It is hand-made throughout—no
cheap and nasty machine work anywhere. It is built on the
staunchest tree of specially tempered 'steel, fitted with an
unbreakable gulletplate, to which are riveted (not screwed, mind
you) solid steel hind crupper plates. This makes the tree
absolutely unbreakable, yet gives Just the elasticity and “give”
needed. The seat is made of specially tanned bag leather, with
very long, thick harness leather flaps, that do gway with the
need of wearing leggings. There are leather points to the panel, that will
not wear out for the whole life of the saddle. |The knee pads are inches
high, and made of solid leather, double sewn inside so that they won’t sag
or give over. The thigh pads are made in the same way and If inches
high. We have the seats with as high a dish as 6 inches, but any lower
dish you want, we can give you. The mountings are brass and , nickel, and
the Dees are fastened so securely that no tug will strain them. The panel
is serge lined, and with extended facings so as not to fray or wear out by
the rubbing of the swag or tucker gear. The saddle is sold fitted with
fold or snlit leather girths, 4 bar irons, stirrup leathers, ring or ordinary
crupper and surcingle.
OUR GUARANTEE. —Any number of these saddles of ours sold ten years
ago are in use to-day and practically as good as new. No stauncher saddle
could be made. The one you buy from us we will guarantee for two years.
If within that time the saddle proves faulty in material or workmanship, if
you return it to us, we will give you a new saddle in place of it free of
charge. If a saddle lasts two years it will last as long as it is cared for
—though of course no saddle will stand being rolled on. or being bumped
against a tree.

“Trotter’s” trip to Europe in two
minutes:—
The most agreeable way of going to Europe in
summer is through Siberia. The path to Japan is
wen worn. We leave Tsuruga, in that country, for
Vladivostock, and spend 40 hours in a Russian
steamer as good as a yacht. By rail it takes 10
days from Vladivostock to Moscow, travelling at 20
miles an hour. The New York-Chicago Express would
rattle it through in four days. At many stations the
halts are so long that we do as much walking as we
take at home. The engines burn wood in the early
Part of the journey, oil in the latter. Leaving
vladivostock, we reach Nikolsk, through wonderfully
picturesque mountain scenery; next to Harbin, and
ship many passengers. The Pekin and Dalny lines
join at Mukden. Then we go through forests of
silver birch and pines, and proceed high up, 3000 ft.,
into the snow of the Khingan Mountains. There is
positively none of the expected monotony. Now we
climb among the Yablonoi Mountains, and pass the
great Dalai Lake. The train crosses and recrosses
innumerable rivers, and enters the important town
of Chita by a fine iron bridge. Then it* proceeds
along the narrow twisting valley of the Ingoda
River. Up mountains again, amid pines and snow,
and on to Verkneudinsk, with its cathedral. All
next night is spent skirting Lake Baikal, and pass-
ing through many tunnels. A grand view of the

What is the meaning of
the word “CINCH”?
The Americans are quick to find
a short word to express a big
meaning.
The term “Cinch” signifies the
best—the highest standard obtain-
able—something better than any-
thing else.
In applying the name “Cinch” to
the instrument illustrated here, the
makers have found the most suitable
term they could have originated.
Jr*
l
THE “CINCH" COSTS ONLY 70/-
It is a hornless Zonophone of very compact type, and may he easily carried
about,, It will entertain, amuse, and enlighten you with the world’s best
music—and do it in a truly musical manner.
Buy the “Cinch”—out there in the country you will find it a veritable host of
cheerful company.

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad to
hear of a simple and scientific device which restores
hearing, no matter how old you are. No mvstery or
secrecy about it; we describe it fully, and' explain
just how it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
fiers, and in the 6ame way you use this sound magni-
fier to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
able. No one can tell you are wearing them. They
rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off them—the
strain of trying to hear indistinct sounds. What a
relief to have done with that tiring strain. Being
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt,
even when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. They protect the tender inner parts of the
par, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers restore hearing, we give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys even the faintest sounds right to the natural drum.
Being of the softest rubber, it cannot hurt the ear.
It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort.
The division that runs
across the mouth is to al-
low the removal and inser-
tion of the Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
the best adapt-
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you have lost
the he a r i ng-
nerve com-
pletely, or were
born deaf, we
cannot pretend _
to cure you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day. But
of you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair. You will never
regret trying the W r ilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
cured, and you can be cured, too. You mav wea,
the Ear-Drums day and night, and take them ou
whenever you wish. Children can wear them (w<
have special sizes for children from six to twelve)
Even a child can insert and remove them without th<
least danger.
•jj® p £\f. e *' t^e * ee for a doctor’s singh
visit). This includes a pair of drums (they are onb
sold m Pairs), a fine nickel remover, and also ai
inserter. After the first pair is bought you may pur
chase a single drum at any time for Bs., but th<
pair you get at first will last quite two years. D<
not ask for a trial pair. We do not send them ou
on trial, and so they are never secondhand. Use tin

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

ANTIN EU RASTHIN
TREATMENT OF
NERVOUS AND WASTING DISEASES.
The wonderful properties of Antineurasthin (Leci-
thin in an absolutely pure form) for successfully
treating all nerve maladies, Dyspepsia, Anaemia,
Rheumatism, etc., and imparting permanent mental
and nerve force, reflect the latest and most important
achievements in medical science.
One of the most important of the wonderful re-
sults obtained by this treatment is that not alone
does it build up the nervous system by feeding the
brain and nerve-cells with their natural food ele-
ment, but on account of its beneficial action upon
the process of nutrition and upon the blood, the
whole general health shows prompt improvement,
particularly in wasting diseases.
A FREE TRIAL.
In order that the worth of Antineurasthin may be
tested, a sample supply, together with a treatise on
nervous maladies, will be forwarded to any address
in Australia on receipt of 2d. in stamps to cover
postage by the wholesale representative, H. A. God-

There are all the differences in the world
between an “abandoned baby,” an “aban-
doned mother” and an “abandoned woman.”
“Fashion Hater” : So far as I am concerned,
I hereby refuse to credit women with more
than an ounce of genuine mental ballast un-
til they get out of the habit of thinking in
rags. And I guess that disqualifies them
for all time. A woman’s first question is,
“What did she have on?” Her second is
“Do you like this hat?” No matter where
she fetches up, the other cats first of all
want to know how she was covered. The
other day, a female murderer was tried in
London for shooting her lover, and a
“woman’s column” had something to say
about it. Thus: “Wearing a large, black
hat " ith a sweeping plume, and a dress of
some soft black material, Marion Blithers
stood in the dock to answer —-—” and so on.
So even when she was face to face with
death, Marion Blitliers’s duds were of more
importance than the woman inside them.
If men suffered in an equal degree from the
deadly fascination of clobber, politics would
be as bad as modern religion—one whirl of
costumes, and candlesticks, and foolish un-
essentials. Try a Parliamentary report in
the manner of the eternal fashion writer :
For the second time this season, the Prime Minis-
ter appeared vesterday in old-gold spats and a purple
waistcoat. Always an original and daring dresser,
the hon. gentleman was enabled to make one
more public appearance through the unfortunate
assassination of the leader of the Opposition, who,
when struck down by the murderous and ill-dressed
wretch, was wearing the blue and white striped
belltopper and the pink suede boots which created
such a sensation last session, and resulted in the
defeat of the Mcßlather Ministry. During his speech,
the leader of the House was much affected, and fre-
quently had occasion to use a beautiful silver-em-
broidered handkerchief which \yas much admired.
It sounds mad, and it is mad. But it is no
madder than the report of any society
“function.”
The cry of an Out-back woman in Maori-
land, where there are some roads that, if
they led to Heaven, would turn the saints
back and make the martyrs sky the robe of
sanctity:—.
Will you do your best to get this Mangakokopu-
road opened? Even if you get one mile of it done
it Will ease my heart. I have been on this place
over seven years, and have been out once to Te
Kuiti; then I had to walk the most of the way of
11 miles to Mangaohae—the part of the road that
was at that time only a narrow track. But it is
not only for myself I am speaking, but other women
in this place. I could ride when first I came in,
but I have not been able to do so for some years
now. It is really the outlet for a large district, as
you know. I think that if Mr. Massey knew he
would help us. It is a mistake for women to come
so far back ; they had better be dead. I would tell
every woman that if I had the chance. We come
back and live like heathens, and what thanks do we
get? We are forgotten. I have had 13 years of
misery, hard work and sorrow.
As a young man “Oom Bill” Lyne had
some experiences with the untamed Binghi
of North Queensland. George Sutherland,
now of Brisbane, recounts them in his book
on “Pioneering Days,” describing what he
saw in the early ’6o’s: —
On Don Creek... .necessity forced us to a battle
royal. Lyne... .came up to look for country. Notic-
ing some blacks’ fires. .. .the boss, Mr. Lyne, and
myself made for the fires, and before reaching them
we met a large mob of the niggers making straight
for the camp, fully armed, and all painted for war. ..
As the blacks advanced at a trot we waved to them
to stop, but they would n0t.... Seeing that our
position was getting critical, one of the party raised
his carbine. Instantly the foreman of the tribe made
a target of boomerangs and waddies, at the same
time making gestures to those behind to back him
up. Our man fired.... sending the traget into splin-
ters. The blacks fled....Lyne went out one morn-
ing to look for country about the head of the Gregory.
After camping out at night he found his horses were
gone in the morning. In wandering about to look
for them he lost his bearings. Luckily he followed
a gully which led him to the river. This he followed
down to within 30 miles of Burketown, some 300
miles on foot by the windings of the Gregory, with-
out any food but cabbage tree. How he escaped the
armies of wild blacks was a miracle.
Young Bill’s look-around the North was
fruitless, so he turned south again, and the
next job he tackled was the very prosaic one
of clerking for a district council.
Stands Scotland where it did? One Alex.
McFarlane was charged recently at Towns-
ville with having played a musical instru-
ment, to wit, the bagpipes, on a public town
road without a police permit. McFarlane’s
defence was that the bagpipes “were not a
musical instrument.” 1 All true Scots will
rejoice to hear that the unconscionable
scoundrel was fined five shillings for blas-
phemy.
An interesting character will drop out of
the N.S.YV. Assembly at the end of this Par-
liament —out-back shearer Jack Meehan, re-
presentative of the Darling. In the redistri-
bution of seats the Far West has suffered,
and, one member having to go, Fern, of
Gobar, beat him for the Labor selection.
Meehan’s temperament proved altogether too
excitable for high life, and he would be much
better off if he had never left the Western
riains. He it was who beat Nick Willis, the
central figure in the land scandals, after
Willis had outed the late Donald Macdonell
no less than three times. There was no mis-
taking Meehan’s popularity then, and since
1904 his strength has increased at every
time of asking. He was the Government
majority that once fell over the stairs and
as a result of that accident he will retire
with a badly-knit pelvis.
From “10-2-4,” who knows him: —
Father O’Reilly, of Bathurst (N.S.W.), who has
been stirring up the Orange Lodges, is far from
being the dour character his maddened opponents
picture him. A more cheery soul you couldn’t meet
in a day’s march. Like the late Cardinal Moran he
is a born leg-puller. If he were a barrister he
would exhaust his humorous energy on the Judge
and his fellow-advocates. If he had been a politi-
cian, he would have found the House an ideal place
for the discharge of his superfluous dialectical steam.
As things are, he can do no more than evoke the
scandalised howl of Brother Snowball and the pro-
testing moan of Sister Gumbrick. This is some-
thing like having to shoot sitting rabbits for sport,
when one’s tastes lie in the direction of lion-hunting.
O’Reillv knows French and German as he does Eng-
lish ; he is a sound classical scholar; and he reads
tirelessly every conceivable sort of printed work.
Add that he is a natural writer, both of prose and
verse, and you get a formidable combination. He
is six feet two and broad in proportion. He laughs
louder, longer and oftener than anyone I know. I
once went for a week’s trout fishing with him. We
caught nothing. The weather was rotten. The cook-
ing was not so much cooking as systematic food-
ruining. The beds were the limit. O'Reilly never
cursed once. In fact, he was so persistently satis-
fied with everything that I felt inclined to try the
effect on his spirits of hitting him over the head
with a board.

ALLOVER FACE
Very Red, Itchy and Burning Hot.
HadThemTwoorThreeYears. Be-
gan to Get Worse. Cuticura Oint-
ment Took all the Patches Away.
3 Moores St., eff Botany Rd.; Alexandria,
N. S. W.—"l suffered with red blotches all
over ray face; they were very red and itchy
and burning hot. I had them for two or
three years and I did not do anything for
them when they began to get worse, so I got
adviee and tried some stuff for them but it
did no good. I used it for six months, then
I thought I would write in for a sample of
Cuticura Ointment. When I began to use
it I could see a difference in my face at once
so I got a tin of Cuticura Ointment and iC
took all the patches away. It has done
people good that I recommended it to who
have had skin troubles. My cousin’s baby
waj very bad with a rash, it did him a lot of
good. I always keep the Cuticura Ointment
and Cuticura Soap in the house now. I have
great faith in them and will always recom-
mend them.” (Signed) Miss Violet Bayley,
March 1912.
FOR PIMPLES AND BLACKHEADS
The fallowing is a most effective and eco-
nomical treatment: Gently smear the af-
fected parts with Cuticura Ointment, on the
end of the finger, but do not rub. Wash off
the Cntioura Ointment in five minutes with
Cuticura Soap and hot water and continue
bathing for some minutes. This treatment
is best on rising and retiring. At other times
use Cuticura Soap freely for the toilet and
bath, to assist in preventing inflammation,
irritation and clogging of the pores. Cuticura

In Melbourne the rush to the Bar is so numerous
that the demand for horsehair exceeds the natural
supply. At least that is the only available explana-
tion of a recent robbery at Port Melbourne, where
thieves entered a stable containing 70 horses, and
removed the tails of many and the manes of some
of them.

Adelaide butchers are frantic over their new abat-
toirs, which have not yet settled down to regular
work. At an indignation meeting, one tradesman
told how he had received 40 calves’ feet as the pro-
duce of eight animals he had sent in for slaughter.
Another had sent in a bullock to be killed, and got
back half of a cow ; but many others thought this was
sheer good luck, as they themselves, in similar cir-
cumstances, had got nothing. The Peake Govern-
ment has promised to take a hand, and see if the
administrative wheels cannot be oiled a bit.

“Eurabbie”: “J.G.” (B. 24/7/’l3) struck Sound
Sense when he drew attention to the unprofitableness
of mining on Ballarat and Bendigo, compared with
the results accruing from the same amount of energy
expended on farming the same land. The mining
laws foster, encourage and spoon-feed this fritter-
ing ; and Ma State’s mining laws are as rotten as
those next door. Down here (Tumbarumba, N.S.W.)
the town can’t even get a decent water supply be-
cause the miner has collared and impounded all
there is for miles, and is holding the accumulated
drink until someone happens along and buys it at a
big price to wash away a farm or two in quest of
the yellow metal they print the Fidei Defensor’s
photo, on. The mining done in Tumbarumba for
years past, and likely to be done for years to come,
wouldn’t pan out enough to buy the plough-shares
required to till this fruitful land ; yet present and
past lawmakers insist that “mining comes first.”
Wheat, spuds, butter, cheese and fruit are meta-
phorically consigned to Flameville; and miners are
permitted to wash your orchard away, by getting an
“authority to enter” from some fossilised Warden,
administering fossilised mining laws. Isn’t it time
we hanged this mining-comes-first fetich?

“Hardup James”: One of the black curses that
fell on Sydney with the small-pox epidemic was
the decision of the three-ball people not to handle any
clothing while the scare was on. The pawning
disease, which is in the blood of Australian poli-
ticians, is also in the blood of many Australian citi-
zens. There are heaps of them who “blew” their
cash quite heedlessly, as long as they have a spare
suit that they can leave with McCehen in return
for sufficient meals to last until next pay day. Most
of these people knew nothing of McCohen’s decision
to shut down on clothes until, having spent their
cash in the old blissful confidence, they took along
the usual brown paper parcel to Uncle, and learned
the dreadful fact that Nunkey had taken to sanitary
ways. J
* * *
An Adelaide lawyer was lately reported by the
dailies as having said that his learned friend—who
was pressing for an adjournment—had “expensive
ideas” of how a case should be conducted. Both
rushed into print, much shocked, to explain that the
word should have been “expansive.” But what is the
difference, where a lawyer is concerned? In the law
the more you expand the more you expound the case,
and the more you expatiate on the case, the more ex-
pensive it is.

“Gerald Barker”: Re “Melb’s” par. about trams
and motor-’buses. First of all, the London County
Council did not make a loss on its tramway system
during the last financial year, although it is only fair
to say that the profits were, like Joe Cook’s majority,
pretty miserable. If the L.C.C. is in a hole over
its trams, how is it that it has recently bought out
the London United Co. ? This was one of the biggest
tramway cos. in England; its lines, starting from
Shepherd’s Bush or Hammersmith, run to such far-
off and wide-apart centres as Hampton Court, Rich-
mond, Hounslow, Ilford, etc. Next, trams are allowed
m London proper, and are running there every day.
“Melb ” can get on a tram on the Embankment, and
find himself practically in Holborn; and when he
finds himself there he will have passed under the
Strand, the whole of Kinesway and Holborn itself.
Each year sees the nearer encroachment of the trams
into what “Melb” terms London proper, as, for
instance, that other tram which is as good as in
Holborn—the one that runs up the Gray’s Inn Road.
They are within a stone’s-throw of Liverpool-street
station, and in 1909 the line across Blackfriars Bridge
was opened. The majority of the progressive mem-
bers of the L.C.C. are in favor of extending the
system into London proper, and it was only the
narrowness of the Bayswater-road, close to the Coronet
Theatre, at Notting Hill Gate, that prevented the
laying of the rails as far as Oxford Circus. As for
comfort, is there any comparison between a ride in
a smellful, bumping, side-skidding, low-roofed beast
of a thing, and a smooth-running tram ? If you pre-
fer riding outside, then go up and place your nether
parts on a hard, wooden seat, and hang on for dear
life. The motor-’bus is easily the best-hated vehicle
in London, and since it has started to kill police-
men the hatred has increased. “Melb” will change
his opinion if he happens to be on one that side-
slides and then gives one bound on to the pavement,
snaps off a lamp-post, and finishes by butting through
a plateglass window. Thousands of women won’t go
near them, and that applies to summer, when the
tubes are stuffy, as well as winter. They are a
novelty in Melbourne now, but wait till that city gets
used to them, and has some practical illustration
of what they can do. They’re brutes!
* * * *
“T. Ruff”: Dunno what is happening elsewhere,
but in our township (Murray Bridge, S.A.), the
coupon system has hitched itself on to the cursed
Derrink, and is making the pace warm. No matter
what you call for you get your coupon, and when
you’ve collected £5 worth you get a bottle of whisky.
All the constant sparrers pool theirs. The “free”
drink comes more frequent that way. Still the prac-
tice is promising to become a nuisance, for, instead
of small boys chasing you for cigarette pictures, you
have grown-up sparrers following you for coupons.
A BLAZE AT BANGALORY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The big bell tolled and the fire-gong clashed,
As down the stairs, in my shirt, I dashed....
And away to where the red flames flashed
Like a beautiful crown of Glory.
The smoke went rolling up to the sky,
And fire from each window whirled on high,
When the congregation gathered to cry
Round the chapel of Bangalory.
The “cop” shook the bell-rope all to shreds;
But the firemen snuggled down in their beds,
And pulled the blankets over their heads—
That bell’s insistence scorning.
So off to the fire rushed ev’ryone
We saved some chairs and a demi-john
And all the boys joined in the fun. . . .
At four o’clock in the morning!
Oh! ev’ry dog in the whole darn town
Was trying the next dog’s noise to drown;
The fowls from their perches tumbled down
With protests exclamatory—
Then the roof fell in and the fire came through,
And the pent-up prayers of the priest-folk flew
In a golden swarm to the starry blue,
From bibulous Bangalory.
Now the preachers wander far and wide,
Like burnt-out ants on a mountain side,
To sell to each sinful Smug or Snide
A tenner’s worth of Glory.
Of brand-new palaces people tell,
We’ll have a fane with a golden bell,
But I glanced through the door at a vision of Hell
That night in Bangalory....

Self-Loading Shotgun
12 GAUGE, MODEL 1911
The Winchester Self-Loading Shotgun has all the good
points of other -ecoil-operated shotguns and also many
distinctive and exclusive features which sportsmen have
been quick to apprecrate and endorse. Among them are
Nickel steel construction throughout; a receiver made
with the Winchester patented “Bump of Strength’
which gives the gun surpassing strength and safety; di-
vided i ecoil, which minimiz s the “kick” to the Lst de-
gree; and a reloading system which requires no read-
justment for different loads. The 'Winchester Self-Loader
will shoot any standard load from a “Blank to the
heaviest with certainty and safety, without tinkering the
action. Also it is a two-part take-down without any
loose parts. These are only a few of the n.any good
points about this gun. To fully appreciate its sup riority,
you should see it. Call at your dealers and look at one.
IT WORKS WELL WITH ALL LOADS

GIVES YOU
&
A SURGERY IN YOUR HOME.
THE lacerated cut or the nasty ulcer which once you
would have had to see your doctor about can now,
thanks to Zam-Buk, be treated safely and successfully
in your own home. It was the discovery of the famous
antiseptic process, and its introduction into the home by
Zam-Buk, that opened up new possibilities in self-treat-
ment.
The old-fashioned ointments are hindered in their
work by the rancid animal fats and mineral poisons they
contain. No attempt is made to draw out of the tissues
the germ life and poison which are the real cause of itching
and inflammation.
It was in trying to get over these stumbling-blocks
that the discovery of Zam-Buk occurred. Careful research
was being conducted in the medicinal properties of certain
herbs, and it was found that one of them exerted an
extraordinary destructive effect on the microbes infesting
a wound.
A certain combination of healing extracts was eventu-
ally found which not only destroys the harmful germ-life,
but effectively draws out all bad matter and corruption, and
having thus purified the tissues ensures a clean and rapid
healing.
Totally different in character from common ointments,
Zam-Buk is also immeasurably superior to them in having
a Ihree-fold action on the skin. First, it allays pain and
irritation. Secondly, it kills harmful germs, and thus re-
moves all danger of a cut or sore taking “bad ways.”
Lastly, when the bad place has been thus purified, it
grows a new layer of perfectly healthy skin. Every home
needs Zam-Buk.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
TTE were travelling along the Hogan-
IfW thulla when Brownie (the moke)
knocked up. He seemed to have
casting disease; he had certainly shrunk a
od deal since we started. I coaxed him
d patted him, and deplored my inability
make him understand that “it was only

01 Avei.na—how good and trustworthy she
was, and such a capital companion. She
cooked tor him. One day he had gone to
town, leaving the gins in charge of his
camp. When he returned he saw about 20
blacks squatted around, and everyone had a
tire, and on every fire there was a damper.
Ihe Hour-bag was empty.
~ I d j d laugh,” he said, “when I seen all
them dampers, an’ th’ way th’ gins was
standin em in rows. They’re such simple
poor beggars, you know. There’s no ’arm
in em. No arm ’t all. There was one
damper there that took my fancy. ’Twas
Admiral Dick’s. He was holdin’it ’tween
his heels, an’ takin’ the burnt patches off
with a blacksmith’s rasp, when it slips away
from him an’ starts bowlin’ down th’ slope,
ap Admiral lets a yell out of him an’ sets
after it, an’ all th’ dogs in camp ups an’
jcipis in th chase. They all vamoosed down
* j pank, an’ nothin’ looked surer than th’
Admiral ’ud ’ave sop for dinner. When ’e
come back he was limpin’ badly, an’ didn’t
look as pleased as he ought. ‘Damper get
wet?’ I sez. ‘No pfear,’ sez th’ Admiral.
Mine been kick him over near water.’
‘Break th’ damper?’ I sez. ‘Baal,’ sez th’
Admiral, holdin’ up a maimed toe; ‘damper
break it me.’ ”
Next day. A couple of old blackfellows
had been hanging atfout my allotment for
hours. Asked them what they wanted. They
said they were waiting for their nominal
wives. The combos had taken them. These
were drinking up town, and the gins were
trying to coax them back to the tents. I
advised the disconsolate hubbies to get a
divorce. In their own way they explained
that if they did so they would each want
another gin; and, this acquired, they would
soon want another divorce; in fact, it would
be one continual round of marriages and
divorces. If one bashed his lady with a
waddy. or jumped on her, by way of correc-
tion, she ran to the combo, and the combo
knocked, slops out of him. So the despotic
King Billy and Admiral Dick had to endure
the humility of smoodging to their own
lubras.
Their domestic affairs were still unsettled
when I took up my bed and walked. On
the Tambo mail track I caught up a swag-
man and chummed up with him. He was
an old man, with a short, scraggy beard, a
sharp, wizened face, and a scalded nose. He
had bandy legs and wore bowyangs. A part
of his name was Jack.
Three or four miles out of Augathella
there is a big scrub. We were half-way
through this when Jack suddenly called out,
pointing ahead: “That’s mine. I seen it
first.” It was a new water-bag, which some-
one had dropped from a vehicle. “The very
thing I wanted.” he remarked with much
pleasure; and while he strapped it to his
swag I walked on slowly, thinking I mivht
see another one. I didn’t; but immediately
after Jack drew level with me he called out
again: “That’s mine!” It was a good
saddle-strap this time, which was another
item he happened to want. I admit I was a
little exasperated at this point, and became
as circumspective as a white hawk.
We walk on for a long while, too watch-
ful to speak; and when at last I spied
something far ahead, I fairly yelled: “That’s
mine !”
Jack gave a nervous jump, and dropped
his billy. “Dash it all,” he growled, recover-
ing the vessel, “yer needn’t frighten a man
if it is your’n !”
He was sulky for a bit, but when we drew
near to the object he looked more pleased
than ever. “Mine” was a dead cat.
That night we put up at Biddenham, a
sheep station on the Nive River, where
shearing was in full swing. An A.W.U.
delegate was holding forth to the assembled
shearers*
“The majority of you,” he said, “cannot
realise the power of labor; that all wealth
is stored labor; that the gold of the mil-
lionaire would be worthless as the pebbles
at his feet but for labor; that the Ship of
State could not progress one fathom without
labor; in short, the whole world would be
paralysed if the working community stepped
out and remained on strike.”
“Hear, hear!” said Bowyangs. Them s
my sentiments, young man,” he added, turn-
ing to me. “You see what a power we are.
Don’t forget it.”
“The capitalist looks upon the worker as
being dependent upon him,” the speaker
went on; “in reality the capitalist is de-
pendent upon the worker for every comfort
and luxury. The world can t get on with-
out him. but it can get on without the
drones of society, the idlers and loafers who
live their lazy lives through on the sweat
and blood-fruit of the misplaced toilers, by
the monopoly of land that to the
people, not to the individual.
“Yere-hear!” said Bowvangs, enthusiasti-
cally. “We’re th’ misplaced toilers—you
an’ me, young man. Don’t ( forget it.
“This is a workimr-man s world, what-
ever we want we must work for; and those
who do no share of the world’s work have
no right to a footing. And yet > the toiler
lifts his hat to them, says Sir to them,
cringes and grovels to them. Bah. it
m “stmThS” Bowyangs. “Thom's my
sentiments, young man.” he added, turn.ng
to me “We’re th’ aristocracy.”
The delegate drew out some tickets, and
besran to expatiate on the importance of
began ■ ; f-Uot those who were not
t(> Bowyangs’ nudged me gently and edged to-
Wa 4here’s d a ,r iot o’ loose dorgs Vre.” he
pn id “I’ll go see if any of ’em s smffm

WORN OUT with the miserable pains of Kidney Disease—
Backache, Headache, Dropsical Swellings, Dizziness,
Heart Attacks and Twinges of Rheumatism.
WORN OUT with the worries and cares of the children
and the home—the constant stooping about, and working from
morning till night. Is it any wonder that the kidneys break
down ?
WORN OUT —So much to do, so little strength to do
it. Every household task made a burden by the miserable
pains of kidney disease —
Lumbago, pains in the loins and back, heart attacks,
dizziness, nervous headache, rheumatism, gravel and urinary
disorders —
The swellings of dropsy, and that heavy, drowsy feeling
which makes you feel so slow and miserable.
But don’t grow disheartened. Neighbors tell here what
a comfort Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have been to them.
Doan’s Pills are for the kidneys ONLY. They relieve the
kidneys and bladder like laxative medicines relieve the bowels,
and dispose of the kidney poisons which are the cause of so
much suffering in men and women. Read this testimony:
Sydney Women Cured.
FIVE YEARS CURED
TWO YEARS CURED
Mrs. E. Chapman, “Rothsay,” Man-
ning Road, Double Bay, Sydney, says:—
“I suffered with severe pains across the
back and in my legs. For six months
I was very bad, and some days would
not be able to get up at all. I tried a
lot of remedies, but they did me no
good. I saw Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills advertised, and thought I would get
some and give them a trial. After tak-
ing the first half bottle I knew they
were good, for I felt a little better, and
from that on the improvement was
marked, and eight bottles completed the
cure. I now feel splendid, and can get
about easily.”
Mrs. Chapman makes a second state-
ment, five years later: —“l am pleased to
bring the above statement up to date by
telling you that I am still well.”
Mrs. C. L. Carter, c/o Mrs. Smith,
Wilson Street, Strathfield, Sydney, says:
—“Two years ago Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills cured me of a very bad
attack of backache and Kidney trouble,
and I am glad of this opportunity to
publicly recommend them. For some
time I suffered agony from backache and
other distressing symptoms of Kidney
trouble, and could get nothing to relieve
me until I procured Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills. After taking a few doses
I felt better than I had for a long time,
and three bottles of the pills completely
and permanently cured me. I have been
free of backache for the last two years,
and this proves that Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills are genuinely good. I
advise all who suffer as I once did to
take these Pills, and I hope many will
benefit by my experience.”
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are sold by all Chemists and Storekeepers at
2/9 per bottle (six bottles 15/3) ; or posted on receipt of price by Foster-McClellan
Co., 76 Pitt Street, Sydney.

PILES
A Lasting Cure by
DOAN’S OINTMENT.
Mr. Joseph Abrahams, 495 Elizabeth Street, Sydney, sajs :-»*.“For twenty-five
years I have been tortured with Itching Piles. The pain and irritation of this
ailment are terrible, and only those who have suffered know what a terrible com-
plaint it is. I used dozens of pile remedies, but could not get anything to give me
ease. I never expected to get a cure for Piles. A friend urged me to try Doan’s
Ointment, saying he was sure this preparation would cure me. I got some and
commenced using it; in a very short time I was completely cured. I shall be
pleased to personally verify this should any sufferer call on me.”
Two years later Mr. Abrahams says “I have not been troubled with Piles
since Doan’s Ointment cured me over two years ago. I have advised many
sufferers to use this grand remedy, and I am sure it will cure in every case if
people will only apply it properly.”
Doan’s Ointment is sold by all Chemists and Storekeepers at 2/9 per pot,
or post free by Foster-McClellan Co., 76 Pitt Street, Sydney.
He didn’t leave the swags again till the
breakfast bell rang in the morning. He
tucked in a good breakfast; he got rations
from the shearers’ cook; he got rations from
the rouseabouts’ cook; he got rations from
the station storekeeper; and he got tobacco
from several people he met about tfie pre-
mises. He had packed it up, and we were
about to start for Oakwood when the Tambo
mail-coach drove up.
“Any chance of a lift?” asked Jack.
“I can take one,” said the mailman. “I’ve
too much load on for two.”
This was a compromise that usually
worked well for the coachman. No prin-
cipled traveller would accept a ride and
leave his mate walking. Bowyangs didn’t
hesitate a moment.
“I’m the oldest,” he said, and, throwing
his swag up, climbed in after it. The dis-
gusted Jehu shook up his team, and away
they went.
Before me a grey plain stretched away
into the hazy distance till earth and sky
were blended. Mirage after mirage ap-
peared, tantalising one with their mocking
resemblance to clear lakes shimmering in
the sunlight. The temperature was an easy
120 degrees. There was no stir in the at-
mosphere, and only at long intervals was
there a tree—its shade so thin that one
had first to locate the sun to find it. The
road was visible for miles ahead, a winding
brown streak through grey grass—the most
depressing kind of road one can travel.
A hole had worn through the sole of my
boot, and no matter how carefully I planted
my foot the vacancy was alw’ays filled by
some hard lump, and I limped along like a
lame duck waddling to water. Finally, I
cut the tongue out of the boot and made a
false bottom with it. Also, changed my
socks. Only had the one (blackfellow’s dog
carried off the other at Augathella), and
the change consisted of taking the sock off
one foot and putting it on the other. The
relief was great.
Millions of flies swarmed around me, and
a great many committed suicide down my
back. Towards sundown flying ants ap-
peared in clouds. They stuck to my face,
hung on to my eyelids, got into my eyes
and nose, buzzed into my ears, and bur-r-r’d
like a steam-engine ; they settled round my
neck, crawled down under my shirt, and the
more I slashed at them with a bush the
more furiously they buzzed and bur-r-r’d
around me.
After dark the ants disappeared. The
flies were roosting on my head and back, so
as to be handy in the morning. Whenever I
stumbled over a clod they flew up with a
sound that was quite startling. I tried to
get rid of them by ducking, and running
round a tree; and when I came to a bush I
dived through it —and nearly strangled my-
self ; but those flies always came up smiling.
Oakwood lights at last! They were shear-
ing stragglers here, and consequently enter-
taining travellers. Here, too, I found
Bowyangs, full and hearty, and much sur-
prised to see me turn up so soon.
“I was glad enough to get here, I can tell
you,” he said. “I couldn’t get me feet under
the seat, an’ th’ sun shinin’ on me boots all
the time —they burnt me feet something
cruel. It was th’ Devil’s own ride across
that plain. How did you get on?”
“Pretty badly, Jack. I tramped that
plain-—without water.”
Sixty miles of open plains lay between
us and the next station. Our road fol-
lowed the Ward River, which was fast dry-
ing up, and here and there we noticed fish
(yellowbelly) swimming in the shallow
pools. We stripped off at several and pud-
dled the pools till the fish rose to the sur-
face. Then, by plunging both hands under
them, we easily threw them ashore. The
pools were few and far between. Bowyangs,
who monopolised the waterbag, wouldn’t
carry more than a couple of quarts—and he
wouldn’t let me carry it. He thought I had
designs on that bag. He never forgot to
notify me when it was getting low.
“Go steady on it, mate,” he would say,
“I haven’t much for meself.”
We were resting under a tree beyond Men-
tone Downs when two horsemen appeared.
We concealed our glowing pipes at once, and
Jack got his “cadging pipe” ready. This
pipe had a bowl the size of a tea cup, and
was always conveniently empty. Once Jack
was handed a plug from which to fill it.
He returned one small corner of it, which
he couldn’t squeeze in. His benefactor
turned it over once or twice in his fingers,
looking at it. “You may as well keep the
plug, mate,” he said, “and let me have the
pipeful.” “Thank you all the same,” said
Jack, “I’ll be able to get a plug or two at
the station. The pipeful will about carry
me there.” Jack had just related this when
the two horsemen reigned in.
“Spare a pipe o’ turbacca, mate?” said
he. “I haven’t had the pleasure of a draw
for two days, an’ me mate’s been smokin’
dry tea.”
“We don’t smoke anything,” said one,
severely.
“If God meant us to smoke, He’d have
put chimneys in our heads.” added the other.
Bowyangs’ mouth gaped, and before he re-
covered from the shock the horsemen had
passed on.
“Blamed psalm-singers !” he gasped, pick-
ing up his swag.
On the following day we met an irre-
sponsible gentleman from Jericho. He had
thrown his swag down and was dodging
round a tree, squinting up into the branches.
A crow was perched at the very top, having
a little corroboree to itself.
“What’s the matter, old man?” I asked,
as gently as possible, for it was evident the
fellow was a “bit screwed.”
“What th’ Devil’s that to do with you?”
said he, thrusting his nose into my face.
“No offence, old man”
“I’m not old man ! I’m Mr. Brown. Do
you know me? Do you know Mr. Brown?”
“Perfectly well. How are you getting on,
Mr. Brown?”
“That’s my business!” He thrust his
nose in again and lowered his voice. “Can’t
you mind your own business?”
“Excuse me”
“I’ll see you hanged first! Who are you
that I should excuse you? What are you
that Mr. Brown should excuse you?”
I sought to pacify him. “I mean no
offence, Mr. Brown”
“An’ who said you did!”
“—-if I give any it's through my ignor-
ance”——
“Your ignorance—yes ! You’ve made
tome most offensive remarks; you have in-
suited me; but, of oourse, I overlook it on
account of that. I have brains. You un-
derstand? Brains!”
Just here the old crow chipped in. Brown
grasped his hat in one hand and sidled
round the tree, looking up. ‘‘He knows me!”
he cried. “That old fowl knows me ! D’yer
hear him? ‘Why don’t yer lay down an’
die?’ he says.
“ ‘Brown, yer dog, be quick an’ die!
We’re hungry an' we want yer eye!’
“Can’t you hear him? The black apos-
tate ! The swine ! The Devil in feathers!
The cow! He’s followed me from Jericho!
He’s going to have me for Christmas —by
the ringbarked spotted gum-tree, he won’t!
I’ll walk meself dog poor. I’ll have him.
I’ll give him something to follow Mr. Brown
for."
He dabbed his hat on and caught up his
swag and billy. Then his eye rested on
me. “You here yet? What do you think of
if? Do you think that’s a legitimate product
of an egg? I don’t. I know his mother —
and his father —and all belonging to him !”
“Quar-r-rk !”
Mx-. Brown started and looked up. “You
call me a liar ! You’re another ! You fiend
incarnate!” The crow hopped on to another
branch, and Mr. Brown made a wild dash
for the next tree. I left him dodging among
the gidgees, and heaping curses on all things
crow-ly.
Near Lansdowne we came upon a man
travelling with his wife and child in a tilted
cart, behind which two goats were tethered.
They had travelled 300 miles, and were
hard up. They'd started with a herd of
goats, and had eaten all but two. These
they had to keep to get milk for the baby.
When he told me he was smoking tea, I gave
him half the tobacco I had acquired during
the morning. I knew the comfort of a pipe
in his position, and that his wife would be
easier in her mind while he puffed the pun-
gent smoke.
They were turning out to siest through
the midday heat. Jack made himself com-
fortable, and seemed quite taken up with
the tilted vehicle. It seemed to set him
visionising, and I believe he was half in-
clined to go back with it. Then the woman
started to cut chips off a log with a blunt
axe, and he left hurriedly. “I can’t
abear to see a woman chop wood,” he con-
fided to me later on; “I always walk away.”
Soon after midday we sighted Tambo
Town, seven miles across the plain, and by
sunset we had made camp by a clump of
dead finish on the Barcoo.
The journey across the plains had made a
wreck of Bowyangs, so we camped two days
at Tambo. The spell put a little more go
in him, and we started down the river.
Bowyangs was an eccentric character. He
was never talkative, but always suspicious
and pessimistic. He slept apart, and boiled
his own billy at his own fire. Once, after
he had spread his things out, being dissatis-
fied with my first choice, I dumped my swag
down under the same tree. When I started
to unroll he found fault with the ground and
shifted. The approach of a drover seemed
to electrify his otherwise lagging legs. He
stepped out briskly to precede me, lest I,
being younger, should step into the probable
vacancy.
There were times when he amused me—
mostly on windy days. The wind blew his
hat off, which stirred up his warped fibre
tremendously, particularly when he had to
put his swag down and chase it across sev-
eral blind gullies, or climb over a fence and
root it out of a prickly lime-bush. He dealt
with the cady in a way of his own. He
kicked it and jumped on it, and called it
anything but legitimate thatch-cover.
I admired that hat; it never looked much
the worse for the assault after he had
welted it against his leg to knock the dust
off. I offered him my straw for it, but he
treated the offer with contempt. There was
no satisfaction to be had out of a hat that
wouldn’t stand being jumped on.
He possessed two pairs of pants. There
was a patch on the seat of one, and a big
gap in the seat of the other. Having only
one patch to suit, he was obliged to transfer
it from one to the other when he changed.
It was the most transferred patch that was
ever hitched to a bifurcated garment.
Late in the afternoon I met a man driving
a small mob of bullocks. They were poor,
lame, and knocked up, and he was flogging
them along—a few at a time. They be-
longed to a mob of Kihee cattle, which were
feeding along behind. These wouldn’t feed ;
they would only stand under trees. They
were continually striking off for trees, and
if there were no trees in sight they lagged
behind, and the others had to be held till
they.were fetched along. So this man was
put in charge of the culls, and his duty was
to dodge them along to camp as best he
could.
“It would break your heart,” he said.
“It’s all day like this. Thank God my
week’s up to-night. If you want a job, you
sight old Swiker; he’ll be coming along
directly. He’s a corpulent man, with a flow-
ing beard.”
“What sort of a boss is he?”
“Oh, a fair nigger-driver. I’ll give you
one week with him.”
Bowyangs had come up, and hearing of the
possible billet, he lit out for Swiker with
remarkable energy. I lit out too, and for a
mile it was a fair ding-dong walking match.
Bowyangs by this time was puffing like a
locomotive, and the sweat was running down
through the dust in little streams.
“I’ll toss you for’t!” he panted.
My sling came undone, and I lost two
minutes fixing it. Bowyangs was in front
again, and the tossing was postponed. Then
Swiker appeared. He was an ex-squatter,
with a corporation like a publican. He
cantered up on a big grey horse.
“Good day, sir!” said Bowyangs, touching
his hat. “Any chance of a job, sir?”
Swiker looked him up and down. “Can
you ride?”
“Ride!” Bowyangs repeated. “I was
reared on horses, sir, went to school on ’em,
earned me livin’ on ’em—drovin’. That’s
what makes me bandy-legged. ’S a wonder
to me I don’t whinny in me sleep, for I jes’
grew on a ’orse.”
“You’re not the sort of drover I’m lookin’
for,” Mr. Swiker interrupted, turning away.
“An’ when I come to look at yer, I’m
danged if y’re the sort of drover I’m lookin’
for!” Bowyangs retorted, and passed on.
I turned back with Swiker.

CONCERNING A COMMON COMPLAINT.
Of all common ailments perhaps Constipation is the one most fruitful of
ill-health and a potent cause of disease in a variety of forms. Too fre-
quently neglected (especially by women) it may result in grave conse-
quences, and all who suffer from it in any degree should set about
establishing a permanent cure without delay. Failure of the bowels to
act properly results in poisonous accumulations, impure blood, sluggish
liver, and r great number of disorders such as headaches, nervous debility,
anaemia, loss of energy, and even diseases of a chronic and dangerous
nature. If you are troubled with this really serious complaint do not
regard it'as a light matter, and remember that the cure may be surely
and speedily effected by means of
