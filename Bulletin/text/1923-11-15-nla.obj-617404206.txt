And quaint good deeds familiar to your

You had the vision. Light lay on the faces
Of your grey women and your quiet men.
You had the vision, and the key of laughter
To open some brave door of happier

The key of tears—of joy. The long here-

The Pitcairn Islanders
The story of the Bounty mutiny is so
well known as to require but the briefest
mention before I proceed to give some par-
ticulars of the life of the mutineers and
their descendants which I have drawn from
a strange old diary that has come to me, a
book stained with sea-water, the ink the
color of rust, the handwriting that of a
vanished day. The entries record the chief-
est events for the first 40 years ,of Pitcairn
life, and provide an almost daily chronicle
of the years from 1840 to 1857, by which
time the community had been transferred to
Norfolk Island.
Fletcher Christian it was, Bligh’s officer,
who was responsible for setting his com-
mander adrift. His sailor-accomplices would
not have minded Bligh’s despotic ways had
it not been for the lure of the Tahitian
women and the lotus-like life the South
Seas promised them. Pitcairn had been dis-
covered and named 30 years before. A chart
showing its position was found in Bligh’s
cabin, and Christian, having no fixed port
in mind, decided it would do. Once landed,
the Bounty was destroyed. No communi-
cation was then possible with the outside
world. Life for the next few years can be
summed up in terms of jealousy, drunken-
ness, debauchery and butchery. In 1800
only one of the original mutineers remained,
John Adams. Himself guilty of murder, he
decided, in consequence of a vivid dream, to
devote himself to the work of caring for the
young colony of half-castes growing up
around him. By the aid of the Bounty’s
Bible he governed his strange kingdom
wisely in industry and religion, undisturbed
till 1808. In that year there arrived by
accident an American whaler, the Topaz,
and then it was that England learnt for the
first time of the fate of the Bounty. The
story soon spread over Europe, and the Pit-
cairners were showered with presents, so
romantic was their history, so shining their
virtue and their industry.
The ehiefest of several wanderers who,
weary of civilisation’s restrictions, threw in
tlieir lot with the island community was
George Hunn Nobbs, an Englishman of
birth and education. He wielded great influ-
ence,. and became in time lawgiver and
pastor, schoolmaster and physician. The
better part of the diary was written up by
him, and on its title-page are these lines of
his own composition :
Where are they now, the infatuated hand
Whose outraged feelings urged them on to crime?
Proscribed, they wandered on from land to land,
To Pitcairn came, and perished in their prime.
Much of the misery suffered by the
islanders was caused through the dis-
covery, .in 1798, by McCoy, that alco-
hol could be distilled from the root
of a plant he had been experimenting with.
In one drunken fit he hurled himself to
death over the cliffs. The womenfolk, whom
the crew had brought with them from Tahiti,
had learned before this that their dreams of
peace and content with their English lords
were but a chimera, and had built them-
selves a boat in which to escape. The boat
capsized. The islanders made canoes for
fishing, which, with the fruits and vege-
tables the rich earth gave them, and the
progeny of the fowls and pigs taken ashore
from the Bounty, insured a plentiful food-
supply.
Adams died in 1829. He and Young, out
of the nine mutineers, were the only two
to die natural deaths. Nobbs had arrived
in 1828, and succeeded Adams as ruler.
From 1830 onwards the islanders were the
spoiled children of philanthropic societies
and curious travellers. Many vessels called,
mostly whalers, and in the ’forties warships
as well, with whom much profitable trading
was done in island produce and clothing. In
, the course of time cattle were introduced,
and rabbits. Nobbs married a grand-
daughter of Fletcher Christian.
The island was visited in 1845 by a phe-
nomenal storm, which is described in vivid
words. Thousands of yam-trees were totally
engulfed under a landslide, part of the
island was washed away, and the result was
several months’ shortage of food. All this,
together with an epidemic of influenza that
caused many deaths, the community bore
with fortitude, treating' such things as visi-
tations of vengeance from Providence for
the sins of their forefathers. (Nobbs dis-
closes himself right through the diary as a
Jewish patriarch born out of due season:
and the personal recollections of such of
the people on Norfolk Island as knew him
bear out his unconscious revelations.) A
school hall had been built, serving as a
church on Sundays. But life was by no
means free from irregularities or from the
family bickerings that we, too, know. Few
of such matters are mentioned in the diary,
however: one learns of them only from per-
sonal communication.
The Admiral in command of the Pacific
station paid an official visit in the Port-
land in 1852, and took Nobbs back to Eng-
land to be ordained as- a priest. Nobbs re-
turned the following year, and, finding the
results of sickness and famine so disastrous,
petitioned for removal to some larger and’
healthier island. The population was at
this time about .170, rather many for such
a small office, aml room was wanted to o\-
poml. Negotiations resulted in Norfolk
Island being chosen. The “Hell of the Paci-
fic” was just being abandoned as a Convict
establishment, and matters were so arranged
that the whole Pif~"”-n community was
transferred there in 1556.
In the early years children were given
Bible names at their birth, but later on
wider choice was available in the names of
ships and their officers, and of friends in
America and England. No reading matter
was allowed on the island other than reli-
gious publications. As a result, the Rev.
Mr. Holman, who was left on the island as
pastor while Nobbs was in England, was
surprised more than once by the inhabi-
tants’ intimate knowledge of the Bible: it
had been their mental meat and drink from
childhood. And to-day on Norfolk the older
people will illustrate their ordinary conver-
sation with Scriptural phrases and refer-
ences as glibly as any soap-box orator with
Ingersoll and Karl Marx and Joseph
McCabe. Religious fervor and love of con-
gregational singing the Pitcairners had in-
herited along with the Polynesian blood of
their mothers: they attended church five
times every Sunday. These evangelical
characteristics it was which so endeared
them to the sentimental people of those mid-
Victorian days, and provided numerous
magazines with acceptable articles and prosy
preachers with texts on the futility of riches
and the blessedness of sweet brotherhood.
All exchange was in terms of barter. Cash
rarely came into the community. Every
detail of work done and work due was care-
fully recorded, and any obligations settled
by a day’s planting or fishing here, the erec-
tion of a fence or a fowl-house there, the
exchange of so many pigs or fowls or cats
(very valuable these because of the rats)
for so many tons of kumeras (sweet pota-
toes) or yams or bananas; and much the
same system is still in vogue among the
Pitcairners’ descendants on Norfolk Island.

Labor’s New Evangel
The “seven members of the British Labor
party” who have written The Labor Party's
Aim (Allen and Unwin) justify the new
revelation in these words:—
The main business of an Opposition is to turn out
the other side and become the Government itself.
Soon or late, that moment of higher responsibility
must come, and the question which must be faced
by the Labor Party is whether it is ready for that
event. The group of people responsible for this effort
to restate the principles of socialism have come
together because they believe that when Labor comes
into power it .must do so with a programme of
measures based on a clear conception of a. socialist,
society.
Though no word of disparagement is directly
levelled at the trade-union movement, it is
obvious that the gospel of the seven anony-
mous, but presumably authoritative, Labor-
ites is the alternative to the creed which
has been the inspiration of Labor in Eng-
land since Francis Plaice’s day. A defect
of trade unionism from the propaganda
standpoint is its arid materialism. The big
English union has become as exclusive as a
club and as business-like as a bank.
Unionism found its soul in the Combination
Acts, an'd in the Conspiracy Act which fol-
lowed their repeal: when persecution
ceased, and the unionist became first a
respectable character and next an industrial
aristocrat, his creed began to die. It was
disclosed at the last Trades Union Congress
that union membership had decreased- in the
U.K. from 6,416,510 to 5,127.308; and the
tendency is not confined to Britain. Fol-
lowing on. the recent feat of general-secre-
tary Willis, of the Australian Coalminers’
Federation, in extracting £9OOO from the
workers of Queensland to help meet the cost
of the late Maitland strike, it was announced
that the Queensland Colliery Employees’
Union had taken steps to get out of the
Federation altogether. British Labor aspires
to give the masses something to be . selfless
and idealistic about again, and the name of
the thing is Internationalism.
Internationalism does not run counter to
a basic element of human nature, like its
stable companion, Communism. The dis-
credited nationalism which has been drench-
ing Europe in blood for the past century or
so, and which now threatens to destroy
civilisation altogether, is a comparatively
recent growth. When the unit of control was
the castle, and for centuries afterwards when
the only dividing force was class, a form
ot political unity was maintained by an
international religion. Catholicism and some
of the great Protestant creeds are still inter-
nationalist. So are medicine, science, the
Red Cross, the postal services and other in-
stitutions. There is a vague but unmistak-
able world-feeling in favor of, at any rate,
an extension of the internationalist prin-
ciple, _ discernible in a disposition to stress
the disgracefulness rather than the glory of
war; to express pious hopes for the suc-
cess of the League of Nations; and to help
nations—even when they are industrial
rivals—in their more dramatic troubles. The
policy of the first British Labor Govern-
ment —assuming the authors of “The Labor
Party’s Aim” are right—will be to politi-
cally capitalise this sentiment.
Characteristically the Marxian doctrine of
class hatred is repudiated. All Labor gov-
ernments, all Labor parties even which see
office in the immediate offing, incline to modify
their radicalism with an eye to the sup-
port of that “silent vote” which is anything
but extremist. The new appeal—on the
political side, anyhow—is not to “the workers
of the world,” but to all well-disposed men
and women. “The most significant change,”
say the authors, “will be the abolition of
the practice and theory of State sovereignty.”
This is not such a drastic proposal as might
appear on the surface, seeing that the
League of Nations has already done it as
regards what Mussolini termed, the other
day, the proletariat nations.” It might not
be distasteful to the capitalist nations if they
could be sure that an internationalist police
iorce would fufil the same functions as a
nationalist one in the way of maintaining
already, acquired property rights. But some
European body has first to appear with the
world-status of a national Cattrt of Appeal,
competent to decide on the equity or other-
wise of such adventures as those of the
French in the Ruhr and the Italians in
Gorfu, and capable of enforcing its decisions.
Is there any sign of such an institution so

Greater Efficiency and Double the Life
''THERE are fundamental reasons why the Tudor Plante Type Battery has double the
usual hire and gives more efficient service during every minute of it. For example, its
plates are both heavier and stronger than the ordinary pasted plates as used in 95 per cent,
ot the house-lighting plants on the market.
I N the Tudor Plante Type Battery the active material is formed on the grid by electro-
. C e . I ? ICa ! a( jtion,and is an integral part of the plate— not a foreign substance pressed into
the grid which will quickly fall out again.
f T is on this essential difference of design and process of manufacture that the superiority
-ft °Vj ~? tter y r f sts minor innovations in other types of batteries can be disregarded,
lhe ludor Battery is naturally slightly higher in price than the type commonly sold with
house-lighting sets, but if its cost is spread over the period of its life it is found to be
actually lower.
The TUDOR PLANTE TYPE BATTERY is
now standard equipment for DELCO-LIGHT
in N. S. Wales and Victoria by the Delco-Light
distributors, Messrs. War burton, Franki, Ltd.,
thus bringing together a plant and battery
worthy of one another.

far? In any case a national police
is only effective in guarding the citi-
zens against the smaller, cruder exploita-
tions. One great food trust or corner may
caiffic more loss and misery than an army
corps of petty bread or meat thieves. The
trust is as much detested and feared as the
nation which is out after places in the sun.
Has any imaginable international Court and
supporting army fairer prospects of blocking
nations which are determined to enrich
themselves than the Courts of the U.S.A.
and Britain have of hamstringing their
predatory trusts? In particular, this doubt
applies to the ambitious colored races which
have absorbed nothing from the West but
industrialism (at which they are already
excelling their teachers) and the knack of
making and using up-to-date war material.
But setting aside these land-hungry and
vigorous peoples, the international problems
smouldering in hatred, jealousy and lust for
revenge through practically the whole length
and breadth of Europe make the task of
British Labor formidable enough.
Christianity began its effort ror “Peace on
earth and goodwill amongst men” under
much more favorable auspices. It did not
get a serious hearing for three centuries;
and after nineteen it is still a long way from
its objective. The British Labor party, with-
out a single great missionary figure, and
with little moral prestige to begin on, hopes
to christianise the world inside 20 years!
J.B.D.
Scissors and Fame
Who, I wonder, was the originator of that
assumption of superiority which accounts
for the names of editors being associated on
title pages with extracts from classic litera-
ture ? 1 I can better explain what I mean
(for I am no man of letters) by instancing
books of extracts published in the 18th cen-
tury and early 19th and comparing them
with others published 100 years later. In
11 SO, or thereabouts, there was a steady de-
mand for a work entitled "The Beauties of
Johnson, consisting of Maxims and Obser-
vations, accurately extracted from the works
of Dr. Samuel Johnson.” These were
arranged in alphabetical order, and a pre-
face by the editor made modest reference to
the trouble he had taken in collating them.
But never a mention of the editor’s name.
“The Beauties of Sterne, with Some
Account of his Life,” printed in 181',), had
its introduction written in quite the best
literary style of the period; but no claim
for authorship was made by the man or
woman who wrote it—nobody stuck his
label on Sterne s monument, so to speuh.
So much for the ancient way of publishing
that class of literary conpilation. But
when I come to a handsome vellum-bound
book of “Specimens of English Prose Style,”
published in 1885, I find that the exhuma-
tions serve as a means for announcing that
the fragments were “Selected and Annotated,
with an Introductory Essay, by George
Saintsbury,” whose name figures large on
the title page. Later Saintsbury touched the
limit of pretentiousness, as I see it, in pre-
paring for the Chiswick Press a volume de-
scribed on the cover as “Dean Swift’s Polite
Conversation in Three Dialogues. George
esaintsbury, 1892.” And the "greatness” of
George Saintsbury in this amazing work of
bluff is asserted by a ridiculous pretence of
enhancing its value by limiting the issue
and numbering each copy. Saintsbury, how-
ever, is not alone in this cant of which he
appears to have been an Early Father.
' Aphorisms of Landor,” publislied in 18y i,
contains a collection of wordy maxims and
mock epigrams by the irascible scholar plus
a few lines of stereotyped comment on the
author’s dwindling reputation ; and the title-
page advertises R. Brimley Johnson as the
selector of Landor’s gems of dulness. An-
other book of selections from Landor (189 U)
proclaims the glad tidings that they were
arranged and edited by Sidney Colvin, whose
short preliminary essay was boiled down,
presumably, from a biography he had pre-
pared for "English Men of Letters.” A
century earlier the same thing would have
been done by a working litterateur who con-
cealed his identity. Finally, I am reminded
of those ancient "Beauties” of Johnson and
Sterne, selected and gracefully prefaced by
anonymous writers, when I take up an
elegant Sesame booklet of “Thoughts from
Chesterton,” and learn that they were
“Selected by Elsie E. Morton.” Not a
word „written by the lady is printed in the
booklet, except “The compiler offers her
cordial thanks to Mr. G. K. Chesterton and
to the following publishers for permission
to \ print extracts from the books named,”
etc r The pretentiousness of Elsie E. Mor-
tori in thus pinning her card to a bunch of
gA.C.’s Thoughts! All these people, it
seems to me, pose as producers of thought
when they are really acting as parasites on
established literary reputation.
E.F.
Form versus Formality
Neither “Maraud Safran” (R.P. 18/10/’23 )
nor George Lambert, it seems to me, touch
anything like the real problem of form and
matter, technique and idea. of
course, is a notoriously vague branch of phi-
losophy, which is only just recovering from
the sterilising touch of the Kants and the
moral circus-managing of the Ruskins. Bene-
do'tto Croce has given a basis for all future
thought here during the last few decades, but
so far he does not seem to have penetrated
to the Chelsea fastnesses where the Lamberts
lurk; though a tawdry garble of his words is
mouthed by many of the modernists, both in
England and America. “Maraud Safran”
also seems innocent of any particular exacti-
tude of thought on the subject.
The basis of Croce’s work is that the in-
tuitive activity which defines the image is
synthetic, an indivisible welding of form
and matter —the imposition of form on
matter. All expression is only an effort to
control sensation or perception and stamp
it' with the structure of the individual mind.
If, th,en, the Oscar Wildes elaborately evolve
an affectation which is called style, and
which defines nothing significant, and re-
mains frigidly aloof from any communion
with the stuff of life, Form (or the living
power of mind to project a vital image or
succession of images) is not thereby depre-
ciated. When Lambert remarks that the
works in which Rodin's “technical skill is
so bounteously displayed are far greater than
the others in which his imagination ranged
unrestrained,” he probably means by the
allegedly imaginative works, those distorted
rough compositions, or those vague figures
looming faintly out of incoherent lumps of
marble, in which Rodin unfortunately in-
dulged at times. If so, he is right to dis-
parage them. But they are not imaginative
works; they are merely vague and, therefore,
bad works. Rodin’s great imaginative crea-
tions are his lyric poems to Love, where the
spiritual ecstasy is defined by the grandeur
and simplicity of modelling and the marvel-
lous delicacy of surface in which Rodin is
unique. It is idle to say that this is a mere
technical problem. To define flesh as Rodin
does is to love flesh ; his so-called technical
qualities are born by the necessity of subtle
and profound ecstasy.
It was in this sense that Blake, whom no one
surely could suspect of cold formalism—in-
deed, it is form that he lacked—uttered his
dictum, “Execution is the chariot of genius.”
We must never fail to differentiate between
mechanical form and passionate form. Can-
ova is far more “ideally” perfect than Rodin,
as Velasquez than Rembraudt. The processes
or Canova and Velasquez can be learnt and
copied, but the strange subtlety of definitive
form in Rodin and Rembrandt can only be
reached by a mind of equal power and equal
vitality. It is, however, wrong to talk as if
Rodin or Rembrandt lacked technique; they
have each a transcendent individual technique
in passion. In the same way Carlyle’s style
can be imitated with the greatest ease. As
a matter of fact, immature bombast will
always out spontaneously in Carlylese. But
no one can imitate Dickens—that is, the
essential Dickens. To do so, they would
have to have as great a power to define char-
acter as he has. Shakspeare’s plays
cannot be tabulated and dissected in order
to show the balance of form they possess, yet
have that spiritual cohesion which is the re-
sult of a binding vitality of formative mind;
while Milton’s “Paradise Lost” is a mechan-
istic parody of grand form, and for that
very reason must always remain the ideal
of all poetasters.
Cold form, as here in Milton, when allied
to a fanatical and barren mind with a
strongly developed intellectual power, can be-
come very dangerous. Still, this must not
lead us to slight that solid constructive ele-
ment which lies beneath all great art.
Dickens’s novels are great despite their dis-
cursive rambling, not because of it. In his
great moments Dickens builds always by a
logical movement through the unfolding of
character by word, gesture and action. The
achievement of Dickens and Balzac, more
than any others, goes to show that where
constructive vitality exists, it will out in
spite of all the efforts of its owners to
throttle and muffle it.
If life is the criterion of art, then Shaks-
peare is correct and assiduously definitive,
while Pope is incorrect and careless. For
Shakspeare never ceases effort in the difficult
problem of relating expression to life, while
Pope spins his oolite artificialities completely
removed from life.
JACK LINDSAY.
The Worms We Are
A local author showed me a letter from
one of Australia’s largest publishing firms
stating that his MSS. were being returned
unopened as it was practically impossible
to publish books profitably under present
Australian conditions. Even the old favor-
ites are being allowed to go out of print.
The “present Australian conditions” men-
tioned were Australian wages, a 40-hour
week, a heavy duty on raw material, and no
duty at all on printed books. Just before
the last Federal election, on behalf of some
local writers I sent letters to a dozen can-
didates inquiring whether they would sup-
port a duty on syndicated “copy,” and on
novels and fiction magazines. Two replied.
The remainder evidently thought we were
such poor worms that we would do no more
than give an apologetic wriggle.
Suppose a curate were to decide that he
would like to be a builder’s laborer for a
week and secured a job by offering to work
for nothing. What would happen? When
he reached the top of the ladder with the
first hod-load, the artist on the platform
would refuse to touch the contaminated
bricks; as soon as the news got around every
man on the job would knock off; the union
secretary would arrive and prohibit another
brick being laid until the curate got the
sack. If necessary, he would threaten to
stop every building in Australia; the hod
and the ladder the curate used would be de-
clared accursed, and the Court would step
in and fine the employer for paying less
than award rates. But suppose the curate
amused himself by writing a short story or
a column of verse, and got it accepted by
hinting that he would feel amply repaid
when he saw his name at the bottom of the
printed column. What would happen? No-
thing, absolutely nothing. No sub-editor
would refuse to sully his blue pencil on the
black-leg copy : no reporter would refuse to
have good A.J.A. “copy” printed alongside
of non-unionist “copy” ; no linotypist wouid
refuse to set it up; and no Court would
fine the proprietor 2d. if he filled his rag
with clipped, cadged and syndicated “copy.”
Suppose, again, someone invented a way
of importing houses ready built, while the
local builder had to pay heavy duty on his
material and high Australian wages for short
hours. And suppose, once more, that some-
one invented a way of multiplying the im-
ported houses by the dozen and distributing
them round Australia at the price it costs
the Australian builder to cart his material
to the job. What would happen? If the
Federal Parliament did not quickly look into
the matter the disturbance would blow the
roof off Parliament House. Yet that is
what happens in the case of imported books
and syndicated “copy,” and the disturbance
the local writers make would not blow out
a match.
Now for some remedies. Why should not
the Arbitration Court be asked to award a
fair minimum for all “copy” written out-
side of the office? If the “copy” was syn-
dicated from overseas the difference could
be paid to the Customs as duty. The same
if it were clipped from overseas magazines.
When "copy” is reprinted from Australian
publications the amount should go to the
author —he sold the right to print in one
paper, not in a dozen. There should be a
solid duty on novels and fiction magazines.
There should be a duty on a fair valuation
of all American films, so that there would be
a chance for local cinema-writers, to say
nothing of local Mary Bickfords and Charlie
Chaplins. The Copyright Act should be
amended. To obtain American copyright an
edition has to be set up and printed in the
U.S.A. simultaneously or thereabouts with
its publication elsewhere; to obtain an Aus-
tralian copyright the American has merely
to sell a copy of his book in Canada, or any
other British Dominion. The Postal Depart-
ment gives concessions to Australian books,
magazines and newspapers. Someone should
get them eliminated in the case of any maga-
zine or newspaper using less than 95 per
cent, of “copy” paid for at Australian rates.
H. W. STEWART.
Poetry and the Public
Poetry has been described as “the highest
manifestation of human power yet granted
to man.” It is the noblest of the arts, and
the one that an individual or a nation can
least afford to neglect. I never think of
Carlyle’s saying that he marvelled at what
men miss without thinking of the neglect
of poetry. I hope “C.0.M.” (R.P. G/9/’23)
is right when he says that even “the practi-
cal man of affairs, if hard pushed, will grudg-
ingly admit that poetry is one of the world’s
fairest possessions.” I fear he sometimes
has to be pushed more than hard. The wide-
spread acceptance of “practical” ideals of
life is the trouble. If from the time lie
leaves school a man sets out to make money
and nothing else, he will get nothing else.
He certainly will not get a liking for poetry.
Nearly everywhere “practical” men, more or
less of this type, are in the ascendant. Pro-
gress to them means little more than ex-
panding imports and exports, more railways,
more electric trams, more motor-cars. This
will account for some of the difficulty in sell-
ing books of verse ; for it is among the not-
well-to-do that you find the most love of
poetry—people who have to think twice be-
fore they spend five shillings on a book of
any kind.
But what is to be done? Can a great
body of lovers of poetry be created? Lest
we be over-confident let us remember that
the Athenian community, which appreciated
poetry better than any other society in his-
tory, was small and rested on slave labor.
The Elizabethan period produced a marvel-
lous body of poetry, but is there any proof
that the number of men and women who read
and listened to poetry then a substan-
tial percentage of the population? Has any
nation developed a genuine love of poetry
among all classes?
With what is therefore not more than a
moderate amount of hope, I offer suggestions
for making poetry more popular. Give more
attention to poetry in education. Put
special emphasis on its beauty and do not
worry much about its grammar and philo-
logy. Try to make it a living thing. Get
rid of the idea that poetry is needed only
by the man or woman with a “literary”
bent. The people who need poetry most are
those who are going into business and the
non-literary professions—and politics. A
civil engineer needs poetry for his soul’s
sake just as much as he does mathematics
tor his daily work. Encourage the speaking
of poetry, which is not the same thing as
elocution. The elocutionist chooses poetry
for its dramatic value, its story. We want
the practice developed of speaking poetry for
its sheer beauty. In Scotland they have
poetry-speaking competitions at musical fes-
tivals, and at Oxford the other day a con-
test of this kind drew far more entries than
had been expected, and much of the inter-
pretation was very fine. Make war at every
opportunity on the prevalent idea that poetry
is an exotic, unmanly thing, produced by
peculiar people. The average man sees the
poet as a pale, weak, effeminate creature,
with long hair and a flamboyant tie, who
cannot discipline his feelings and does not
pay his tradesmen. The poets are partly
responsible for the picture. If a scoffer
knows enough he will hurl at you the case
of Shelley, whose eccentricities and irregu-
larities were sufficient to prejudice Matthew
Arnold against his poetry. Let poets bear
in mind that the more they publicly and'
ostentatiously brand themselves as poets, the
more they try to appear different from other
men, the more harm they are doing to the
cause of poetry. We must convince the
average man that poetry is not the hysteria
of a band of “long-haired aesthetics,” but a
natural flowering of man’s imagination and
a glory common to the race. If only Aus-
tralia could produce a Kendall who was also
a Trumper or a Macartney, or a Bernard
O’Dowd who was also a Brookes! When a
poet makes a century in a Test match poetry
will begin to come into its own.
Though we toil gladly for our Lady of
Love we cannot quite stifle the doubt—
you can lead a man to Beauty, but you can-
not make him drink.
ALAN E. MULGAN.
Sea Tracks of the Spee jacks, by Dale Collins
(Heinemann). A couple of years ago a young man
of Chicago, name! Gowen, who had made a lot
of money out of cement and was fond of yachting,
was foolish enough to hit on a motor-boat tour of the
world as a new way of honeymooning. Calling at
Australia —after being towed half-way across the
Pacific —he picked up Dale Collins, whom The Bul-
letin was beginning to regard as its most promis-
ing voting storywriter, and took him off to write
up the log. Here it is. As a matter of fact the
progress was so slow and the tracks of the motor-
boat so circumscribed that Collins might have made
a better story out of a voyage by ordinary mail
packets. What there was to do he has, howeve',
done very brightly. But don’t trust his figures.
Prices of rubber or something such, it seems, “fell
100 p.c.’’ recently: and “we saw the precious soil
[of an F.M.S. mine] being compelled to yield up
its harvest of tin —a harvest which ran as high as
73 p.c. !"’ No wonder the printer put a Jniark of
astonishment after that sentence! The volume is
handsome—as befits the record of a millionaire’s
cruise—and finely illustrated.

Shipping 780 Cars
in one day!
Widespread demand for Studebaker
motor cars, necessitates large scale
production in Studebaker factories.
For example over 81,000 Studebaker
cars were sold during the first six
months of 1923. This huge volume
necessitated shipping as high as 780
cars in a single day from the mam-
moth Studebaker works which repre-
sent an investment of £9,500,000 and
give employment to 20,000 people.
You should inspect the Studebaker
line before you buy. There are twelve
models to select from —each a “Six”
and each backed by Studebaker’s 71-
year-old reputation for highest qual-
ity, honest value and fair dealing.

The
CASE
Touring Car.
A Justification of Case
Model X Prices.
The value of a motor car is measured by
the quality of its finish and by enduring per-
formance. in the final analysis these traits
are not evidenced by picture of pen or brush,
nor by pages of mechanical specifications.
The crucial test is a careful scrutiny of the
finished product, and a thorough investiga-
tion of its record over a period of years.
Only quality of the highest standard can sur-
vive such inspection.
The higher price of the Case Model X may
not appear justifiable upon a casual compari-
son with other cars. Some have engines
larger than ours, many have a longer wheel-
base, and a chassis fitted with a seven-passen-
ger body. Size, however, is not accepted as
the criterion of automobile value. Concealed
values largely affect the price, and. frankly,
we cannot build down to a price and feel that
the product is worthy to bear the name
“CASE” —which has stood for over eighty
years as the symbol of highest quality.
Concrete Facts on Case
Superiority.
It. is necessary to go to higher-priced cars
to find bodies of either open or closed types
that will compare in quality of material and
workmanship, in beauty of design and finish,
and in durability, with those mounted on the
Case Model X Chassis.
Selected ash, scientifically kiln-dried, is used
in the fabrication of a framework, reinforced
throughout by malleable braces. Joints are
carefully machined to an exact fit, and joined
by glue and screws. The completed wood
frames are then coated with linseed-oil, and
primed to prevent deterioration and squeaks.
It is often lack of care in constructing and
coating the framework, hidden beneath the
body metal, that causes inferior bodies to
squeak and rattle. Over all, twenty-gauge
special body steel is formed in a sheath of
unusual beauty of line.
In finishing the body the same careful,
scientific treatment is exercised. Body steel
is lime-treated, to clean thoroughly against
rust, and primed inside and out. A. lasting-
finish is the result of laborious hand-rubbing.
The surface is repeatedly colored and var-
nished, each coat being rubbed before the
next is applied.
.The units in the chassis are so well selected,
and the line of power so straight, that our
comparatively smaller motor delivers its
power so efficiently that the Case Model X
will out-perform competitors in speed power
and economy.
The more expensive Harvey springs and
the original Case method of spring suspen-
sion, together with correct weight distribu-
tion, results in riding ease found only in
higher-priced cars.
The Case brakes, with drums 16in. x 2 Ms in.,
giving a braking surface of one square inch
to each 6-7/9 pounds of car weight, insure
car safety. The special compensating feature
of Case brakes ensures brake action inde-
pendent of the load or unevenness of the
road. Chattering brake pedals, noisy hook-up
and hot brake drums are unknown.
The circulating splash system of engine
oiling was abandoned by Case several years
ago in favor of the more expensive method of
force-feed lubrication through a drilled crank-
shaft. Positive oiling of the vital engine
bearings and better oii economy are more
than worth the additional manufacturing-
expense involved.
The fabric universal joints, the use of which
is made possible on Case cars by reason of the
slight angularity of power line, are superior
to metal types of joints.
While some car manufacturers have cheap-
ened the construction of the vital parts, they
have put on a lot of inexpensive yet flashy
equipment to catch the eye, and to mitigate
the deficiencies of finish. Case is built well
from frame to top, installing such expensive
equipment as power tyre pump, snubbers,
automatic stop signal, motor-meter, engine
thermostat, etc., as is necessary to complete
the car for daily use under all conditions.
The intelligent buyer of motor cars cannot
fail to recognise value if given an oppor-
tunity to examine our product. We are con-
tent to enter the crucial test, satisfied that
our standards of quality will prevail over any
competition based on large production and
low prices.

"’PHIS Single-Six Packard Touring Car re-
JLL cently seen about Sydney streets is the
property of Mr. H. S. Cusack of Bennett &
Wood Ltd., Sydney.
Mr. Cusack recently returned from holiday-
ing in America. During his stay there he
never once set foot on a train, the whole of
his travels being done in this car.
He journeyed from west coast to east coast
and altogether completed 14,000 miles.
COST OF TRIP
The remarkable thing about this tour was the
economy with which it was carried out. Mr.
Cusack has kept intimate costs and statistics
of his trip. The total cost, which includes
everything except depreciation, was four cents
per mile.
The car averaged a little over seventeen miles
to the gallon on the whole trip.
No adjustments were necessary, and to use
Mr. Cusack’s own words—
"l never once used a spanner nor any other tool
on her the whole way through. Nothing went
wrong, she cost me nothing for repairs and
she behaved like the aristocrat she really is. ”
The original front tyres were destroyed on
arrival at Sydney to obviate paying duty.
They had covered 14,000 miles of solid travel.
The rear tyres had resisted about 11,000 miles
before needing replacement.
SEVEN-BEARING
CRANKSHAFT
Asked why he decided to buy a Packard, Mr.
Cusack said that one of the main factors in
his decision was the seven-bearing crankshaft
of the Packard, and of course the tradition
that Packard is one of the leading cars in the
world and can be bought at a moderate price.

Spoil of Dreams.
My mind, that went a-pirating,
Has brought back spoil of dreams to me—
A larkspur trophy of the sky,
A turquoise fragment of the sea,
White wings of seagulls glinting by,
Ix>w roars of far surf thundering.
I feel the crisp sand backward flung
From hasty feet, brown, swift and bare;
The salt wind withers lustfully
The wild flowers tangled in my hair;
To-day is Youth’s eternity—
And I am beautiful and young.
About my neck I wear a string
Of pale sea-shells that kiss my breast
(They chink and whisper stealthily
As on the sand I drop to rest),
So frail that through them I can see
Blue veins with red blood rioting.
Then, spell-destroying, come the gleams
Of street lamps through my fading pane—
Outside a drab world darkening,
The city pavements wet wfitli rain....
Oh, Mind, go out again and bring
More wealth, more warmth, more spoil of
dreams!

To the Lions.
Come not again, dear sun,
Unless you bring
Ardor less weary a little.
Sweet hope not so brittle,
And quiet from the groves
My heart so loves —
The quiet where, with spread and spotted
wing,
The brown quail run.
Hang there awhile, low moon ;
I fear the day,
Roads and the panniered asses,
The silly wayside lasses.
The laugh of the fool that gapes
Trampling his tub of grapes;
Hang there a little while. Here I will pray
For quiet soon.
I have loved girls and lost—
Loved God and lose.
Have not the foaming horses
Raging the chariot courses,
Panthers and dungeoned apes
Twisted the shapes
Of passion? There is nothing left to choose
At nothing’s cost!
Some singing, some o’ercast.
Some without lamps,
Around the seventh column,
Turbaned and solemn,
Full-burdened, black and brown,
The slaves go down ;
So the procession of my prophets tramps
Endlessly past.
What’s night to me or day?
Storm or soft airs?
The gleam of ponded fishes?
The wells of wishes?
’Tis peace, dear peace, I need
And a heart freed ;
For love, vain love, tortures in gold-spun
snares
My spirit away.
VICTORIA.
FURNLEY MAURICE.
Evening at Bondi.
In mauve and heliotrope the skies
Grow soft behind the shadowed trees;
The tumult of the hot day dies
And stillness falls upon the breeze.
It seems as though a holy hush
Holds all the earth a moment still,
And cheeks day’s bustle, and the rush
Of eager life and voices shrill
To give the day its obsequies.
Or breathe a soft, sweet, thankful prayer
Because the glorious thing that dies
Had made the world a while so fair.
Night rushes in; and through its shades
The little lights gleam here and there,
Like flashing jewels which may braid
A brunette beauty’s matchless hair.
A cool wind moves; the stars are out;
Bright light-points glitter on the sea;
With laughter gay and merry shout
Life wakes again to revelry.
If such a pause for me is set
As falls ’twixt parting day and night,
Shall I too yield without regret
A day that gave me its delight?
Glad from its labor to be free.
I’ll greet the night, and take its best,
Till slumber softly calls to me
To give my tired soul its .rest.

THE BRITISH ELECTIONS—AND
AFTERWARDS.
Another old fetich besides that of volun-
tary military and naval service is liable to
perish in Britain as a result of the Great
War. The non-compulsory service idea was,
to a considerable extent, a make-believe as
well as a fetich, for the Cold Country at dif-
ferent times evolved quite a number of
forcible but surreptitious devices for recruit-
ing its forces, and it also frequently side-
stepped the issue by hiring the compulsory
forces of mean little potentates who kept
armies not for defence but to let —hackney
armies in fact. But the Freetrade idea was,
and with some it still is, a very genuine
British delusion. For a while, though not
for very long, it might have been called a
unanimous one. Many people believed that
Britain invented Freetrade, which was a wild
absurdity, for though the genius of British
stodge may have struck the idea of making
a religion of the thing, the thing; itself was
known to the Australian aborigines and
other low-grade folk further back than any
record goes; or if they didn’t know it they
practised it just the same. In fact, the
wood dated back to the beginning, and the
only novelty was that Cobden and Co. made
out of it a god.. All-wool apostles held that
Freetrade, like cleanliness and godliness, ap-
plied in all circumstances, and that the
three were an infallible trinity. Now a set
of circumstances has arisen in which it
doesn’t apply worth twopence.
* * * *
There was one previous great military
event in British history since wars began
to be fought with bonds and debentures; but
that, Napoleonic event ended differently. It
didn’t leave Britain with a mass of dubious
or worthless paper on its hands, for the
small subsidies of these days were gifts,
whereas the late struggle bequeathed to it
nearly two thousand millions of what look
suspiciously like bad debts. The first war
left Britain owing no man outside its own
bounds anything, while the second left it
owing to one importunate creditor alone close
on a thousand millions. One episode, ended
with the United Kingdom supreme over all
the world in finance, commerce and manu-
factures—so supreme that the early Free-
traders based their calculations on the
assumption that the Book of Competition was
definitely closed. The other ended with it
second in every occupation except that of
sea-carrier, and with very poor prospects,
unless conditions alter materially, of keep-
ing or even third place in several. In
18L> the Land of John Bull was a very
higli-tariff place up against low-tariff rivals,
for nobody yet took the idea of competing with
the industrial _ giant seriously. Germany
and Italy didn’t exist. Only a fragment of
the United States existed, and its first effort
at Protection, the “Tariff of Abominations,”
as the infuriated cotton-planters of the South
called it, wasn’t due for another 13 years.
The possession of Hanover gave the British
traders access to the very centre of the rich
countries which were to become Prussianised
Germany later on, and these lands were
England’s milch cow, just as they had been
Rome’s in pre-Reformation days, before that
energetic collector, John Tetzel, overdid a
good thing. The colonies, such as they were,
supplied open markets, for they had no
tariff-making powers of their own then. In
addition to everything else, England and
Wales had little more than one-fourth the
population of to-day; they really were a
young country, with abundant room for ex-
pansion. Finally, it was an interesting though
irrelevant episode that, just when Freetrade
was feeling its feet, the great Australian
gold discoveries came, and the resulting com-
mercial boom was cheerfully annexed by the
Oobdenites as their own doing, and pretty
generally accepted as such. On the other
hand the Land of John Bull in 1918 was a
free-importing place competing against liigh-
tariff rivals, and a sheep among wolves in-
stead of a wolf among sheep. And the other
conditions have changed out of all knowledge ;
while the new phenomenon of big com-
petitive States with depreciated currencies
has added a disastrous element to the com-
plication.
* * * *
Something after the fashion of a gentle-
man who has been burned out without in-
surance in his later years, Britain is begin-
ning business —the business of capturing
world-supremacy—afresh; and, every other
expedient having failed, there is a tendency to
try the same tariff weapon which did such
good service over a hundred years ago. The
conditions are different, but the issue is the
same, save for the fact that this is in the
first place a defensive fight, and that Britain
has to do something sudden to keep its home
market. The capture of new foreign markets
is a subsequent matter. The position is that
the United Kingdom’s imports have got into
the habit of exceeding exports by anything
between two and six hundred million pounds
in a year (the excess reached the latter
astonishing figure in 1919). It used in pre-
war days to meet adverse balances of this
sort (but never of this size) out of the
foreign earnings of its ships and the interest
it received abroad in its capacity as the
world’s creditor. Now that the United States
has taken on the job of world creditor, and
Britain is itself Uncle Sam’s debtor, and so
many outside investments have gone bad, the
strain of paying is too much, and if exports
can’t be much increased, owing to foreign
tariffs and the impoverished condition of old
foreign customers, then a violent shutting
out of imports is called for. Even in
British manufacturing cities British goods
are being undersold by imported stuffs, and
in this fifth year of the peace an impression
prevails that the unemployed are to be a per-
manent institution unless there is a change
of policy. In 1920 a well-meaning Govern-
ment took on the idea of unemployment in-
surance, and it feels none too well satisfied
with the results. It refused to provide for
outworkers and agricultural laborers, being
daunted by the vast possibilities of the case,
yet_ over fifty millions has been paid out in
a single year. So Prime Minister Baldwin,
despite his overwhelming majority, threatens
to precipitate an election next January, and
to fight it on the fiscal issue in order to get
a definite mandate. Freetrade will be repre-
sented by the official Opposition, which is
Labor, and the straggling remnant of the old
Liberals of the Manchester and Gladstonian
and Freetrade schools. Their cry is that
food must not be taxed. Baldwin will re-
ply, of course, that he does not propose to
tax food ; but unfortunately that won’t decide
the struggle. For behind the forces of the
Opposition will be that vast unreasoning
body of intense Conservatism which, in spite
of 50 years’ compulsory education, still hugs
the belief that wife-beating is a free man’s
privilege: and side by side with this blind
body will march another which thinks it
foresees the downfall of the aristocracy—
perhaps of all private property—in a con-
tinuance or aggravation of the present strain.
A RELIC OF BARBARISM.
The Mascot (Sydney) Council, according to
a newspaper report, has been receiving com-
plaints from ratepayers about “boys of school
age who destroy the gutterings of roofs in
trying to recover pigeons wounded by the
Gun Club.” The mysterious immunity cer-
tain persons and institutions enjoy from the
attentions of the law has often been remarked
of late by The Bulletin, and gun clubs
afford glaring examples in point. A gun club
which operates in a residential suburb is
everything that is meant by a public nuis-
ance. The noise is an offence to the ears of
those inhabitants who are not deaf, and the
spectacle of the birds with “legs down,”
shattered wings and blood-stained breasts,
waiting drunkenly on trees and the roofs of
houses for death to end their pain must
sicken all but the stonyhearted. Disorderly
houses* are suppressed in the cities, not on
moral grounds, but because they are an an-
noyance to some of the neighbors. Seaside
cottages rented by groups of working-men
are often dealt with by the police for no
other reason than that the week-end flow of
beer and song is objected to by others. In
most localities a protest lodged by even one
resident is enough to induce the police to
take action. What special virtue is there in
gun clubs that they should be allowed to in-
terfere with the comfort and affront the
feelings of thousands?
* * * *
The Mascot police, like most suburban
units of the Sydney force, have shown com-
mendable energy for years past in suppress-
ing two-up and pak-a-pu schools. In what
respect does a gun club differ from a common
gaming-house? The be-all and end-all of this
noxious business is betting. The shooters are
handicapped (by being allocated marks from
21 to 30-odd yards from the trap with refer-
ence to their past form in dropping birds in-
side a boundary-fence), and the odds are
taken or laid, not only by the holder of the
gun, but by his fellow-members and their
guests, over every shot. “Never back any-
thing that can talk,” is a sound old sporting
adage, and it applies with peculiar force to
most gun clubs, where the practice known
as “missing for the books” is usually in evi-
dence when a “flash mug” is playing up his
cash, or that of his employer. No one has
ever heard of a cricket or tennis champion
performing under an alias, but nine-tenths
of the best shots in most of Australia’s gun
clubs refuse to appear under their own names.
They recognise, by implication, that their
blood-stained pastime is too disreputable for
publication. And it is this shady form of
betting that is condoned by the authorities
while the patrons of comparatively respectable
gambles arc treated as criminals!
But it is on the humanitarian side, all said
and done, that a gun club most outrages the
conscience of a civilised white community.
Three-quarters of a century ago many were
able to stomach the thought of wild rock-
pigeons being snared, of their tails being
dragged out and their eyes “pinched” to give
them a snipe-like flight, and of their use as
targets under conditions which, while allow-
ing many to escape from the club grounds,
gave none worth mentioning a chance to do
so unhit. Few can hear of these things
without a pang nowadays. The prime advan-
tage of blue-rocks for the purposes of this
so-called sport is that they are extremely
difficult to kill: they “carry a lot of shot,”
as the phrase goes. Less hardy and there-
fore more fortunate birds would collapse and
be retrieved by the club dogs as a result of
stopping a half, or even a third, of the charge
most pigeons are able to carry away.
The whole value of the prey is as a
gambling instrument, a contingency to
wager about; and so the pigeon gets
the preference, and the taxpayers adjacent
to the gun club the spectacle of the birds
dying hard in inaccessible places. The bear
was similarly distinguished in the Middle
Ages: the animal’s temperament and its
comparative harmlessness made it ideal for
baiting purposes. The pugnacity and courage
of game-cocks caused a boom in them during
the eighteenth century closely analogous to
the pigeon boom which is in progress in
most of our big cities. As in pi geon-
shooting, both the sadistic and the bet-
ting elements were present, the idle
rich wagering spiritedly on cocks which
were destined to be either mutilated or killed
out of hand. With the onward movement of
Civilisation the community turned against
such barbarities. Bear-baiting was regarded
as a disreputable proceeding, and cock-
fighting was made a statutory offence.
Pigeon-shooting only came into favor to-
wards the middle of the nineteenth century.
It took the British public some time to real-
ise that this amusement was, if anything,
more cruel and degrading than the infamies
that had been practised in the name of sport
in the past; but when the point was grasped
the response was prompt. Persons of all
classes from the Queen downwards joined
in the agitation to have it stopped, and
the upshot was that the shooting of any sort
of captive bird from traps was made illegal.
In Australia, of late years, the tendency to
recognise that animals and birds have their
rights has grown to a gratifying extent. A
couple of ruffians got three months’ hard
labor apiece in Sydney only a few days ago
for torturing a dog, and in the same week
a man was given a month for grossly ill-
using a pony. It may be safely assumed
that if a number of citizens took to shooting
ponies or dogs, with the result that the
countryside became infested for several days
after each battue with more or less severely
wounded animals, scandalised public pro-
tests and police action would quickly follow.
Nor would it be accepted by the community
as a valid excuse that the dead and dying
had been given every chance of escape by
having their eyes injured, etc., before being
turned loose. The average citizen would not
even condone the horror if told that the
pony- or dog-shooters had formed themselves
into a club for the pursuit of their hobby,
and that practically every animal fired at
was backed to escape immediate annihila-
tion. Doubtless a wounded pigeon suffers as
much anguish, mental and bodily, as a
wounded dog, and it is with a realisation of
this physiological fact that the scandal of
the gun club needs to be approached. Pigeon-
shooting is as fiendish an outrage on dumb
and otherwise helpless creatures as has been
devised in any age. It has been outlawed
in every white country where reasonably
decent social standards obtain. That it
should still hang on in great cities such as
Melbourne and Sydney is an affront not
only to the self-respect of the Common-
wealth but to its intelligence. For one of
the first principles of modern psychology
lays it down that publicly-condoned cruelty
is the inspiration of most crimes of violence.
“BOXING” IN AUSTRALIA.
Concerning a matter that wants regulating:
Recent occurrences indicate that the high regard
of Australian politicians for pony-iacing plutocrats
is extended to promoters of boxing contests, especi-
ally those under the patronage of J. Wren. Men
who make a business of arranging bruising matches
are not. conspicuously useful in the economic sense,
and no one has ever accused them of possessing the
fatal gift of beauty; nevertheless they enjoy privileges
and exemptions denied to productive members of
society. Though Australia is short of bricklayers it
would be waste of effort for a building contractor
to apply for permission to bring in even one
colored bricklayer; on the other hand, boxing-
promoters are apparently allowed to impo t as many
colored pugs as they can place—there were three
in a late crate. Certainly all such arrangements are
subject to a time-limit, but, if the tinted thumpers
retain their d awing-power at the end of the period
covered by their exemption certificates, that limit
may be extended again and again. There was one brown
boxer who arrived in 1919 and was permitted to re-
main upwards of three years—long enough to acquire
a wife and add to the p.oblem of mixed races. The
Immigration Restriction Act passed in the first year
of the Commonwealth, and since amended on several
occasions, is evidently inadequate to protect Australia.
***•■«
Again, boxing-promoters are exempt from the obli-
gation, by which ordinary employers are bound, to
cover their men with an accident-insurance policy.
When a pugilist is killed or permanently incapaci-
tated in the ring, the burden of caring for his de-
pendants is passed on to the public. The man who
arranged the match is not even compelled to contri-
bute his share of the “gate” to the hat which is
sent round on these occasions (always with patheti-
cally futile results) or to lend his hall, as he has
been known to do, for a “benefit” that generally
belies its name. And there have been three cases
lately—one at Sydney, one at Melbourne and the
third at Brisbane —of boxers being punched into the
Valley of the Shadow of Death. The N. S. Wales
victim was Jack Johnson, a, laborer from Newcastle,
only 18 years old, and the “sole support of his
mother, a widow” —this was printed before the
Stadium “benefit,” which, being held on an off-
night, yielded only a few paltry pounds. Battered
to the floor in the 18th round of a fight with one
Uren, Johnson was carried unconscious to a hospital,
whence he emerged weeks later in the pitiable condi-
tion which sometimes succeeds to concussion, and
which may lead to paralysis and blindness. The
Queensland unfortunate was Frank Soadv, also 18
years of age, and, according to the Courier, “having
his first contest over the ‘2O-round journey, all his
previous appearances having been in 10-round bouts.”
In the latter part of the butchery Soady was so
seve ely punished that “when the gong rang for the
17th round he could not leave his corner. He leaned
against the ropes in a dazed condition, unable to
protect himself.” But the police did not interfere,
nor the referee. That would have deprived the
Stadium crowd of the bonne bouche of 20-round box-
ing, considered as a spectacle—the exquisite thrill
that comes when a beaten boy is knocked insensible.
So: —■
Lynagh advanced across the ring in fighting atti-
tude [and] dealt out a few blow's. Soady fell through
the ropes, where he w r as counted out. The uncon-
scious boxer was lifted into his chair, and his
seconds applied restoratives. But matters took an
alarming turn. Soady’s pulse-beats could not be felt.
Dr. Crow'e energetically applied artificial respiration
methods; then stimulants were tried, and at length
a deep breath rewarded the doctor’s efforts. Never-
theless efforts to restore the lad to consciousness
were unsuccessful. He was removed to the General
Hospital, where, 24 hours later, he was still uncon-
scious, though not considered to be in any immediate
danger. His condition at one period was very
serious.
At tiie moment of writing—and that was five days
after the unspeakable outrage—the unfortunate fel-
low was still unconscious. But no word has come
from Brisbane as to the arrest of anybody concerned
in the events of the 18th round, and which may cause
permanent disablement or insanity, if not a lingering
and painful death.
* * * *
In the Melbourne affair, as in Soady’s (only seven
days separated them), the damage was done by a
knockout 'blow administered to a man exhausted by
51 minutes’ fighting. But the Melbourne boxer (Jack
Dunstan, an R.A.N. sailor with a fine war record)
was carried to his death-bed. He had refused to
admit defeat until the fatal blow 7 came over, and paid
the penalty with his life. “In the lfith round,”
the Age leport states, “Dunstan was sent dowm
twice, and was saved from the knockout by the
gong.”
The excitement was increased to fever heat in the
17th round when Gornik connected with a rignt
cross and a powerful uppercut. Dunstan was floored
by these, but scorned to stop down a few
seconds to secure the advantage of a respite he
so badly needed. A blow to the body staggered him,
and a blow to the jaw sent him down for six seconds.
When ho fell he appeared unlikely to rise in
time, but he did, and was so palpably beaten that
when Gornik mercifully pushed him off he slid to
the canvas again. With his arms around his op-
ponent’s legs, and his head between them, Dunstan,
smiling bravely, remarked to the nearest onlookers,
“I’m done!”
Done the poor devil was, hut the gong
him again, and he came out for the 18th rouno,
“weak but determined as ever,” to receive “a scien-
tific clip to the point,” and to fall “full-length on
the covered floor, with which his head came in con-
tact with resounding force.” He “lifted his head,
as if in an attempt to rise, then sank back limp
and unconscious,” and was borne away a dying man.
The Coroner’s verdict was that stereotyped stupidity,
“no blame attachable to anyone.” Certainly, the
evidence was wholly favorable to the management
the Age reporter was not called, nor any of the
spectators mentioned as having heard the “palpabli
beaten” boxer say “I’m done” —but a few remain
on the revolting brutality of the business, after the
16th round, at least, would have been in order.
Committal of the principals for trial, on the ground
that a life had been lost, and that it was for them
to show that no sickening savagery—no barbarous
onslaught on a man incapable of defending himself
had contributed to the tragedy, would have been
mo e salutary still. It is not yet too late for the
Victorian authorities to draw up an indictment.
The boxing fraternity should not be encouraged to
believe that it is exempt from responsibility for sins
of commission or omission which result, or may
result, in death.
* * *
Acts for the better control of professional boxing
are needed in all the States. They should provide,
among other things, for the abolition of 20-round
affairs and for the insurance of boxers against the
risks incident to their trade, which risks would be
greatly reduced were fights limited to 10 or 12 rounds,
as in America. That country has long recognised
that the knockout blow, rarely harmful in brief
bouts, is apt to be dangerous in contests extending
beyond 12 rounds —the fall, perhaps, more than the
blow. Dempsey, the champion, has never fought 20
rounds in his life; neither has Gibbons, his recent
opponent, who engaged in 24 encounters, all innocu-
ous, in 1921. Even in England, where Queensberr.v
rules were invented, the brutal and hazardous 20-
rounder has become a thing of the past.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Lesson from Spain.
A London weekly, writing of the recent
coup d'etat in about the most reactionary
country in Europe, observed: —
Spain has never had a true representative system.
Except in the big towns, a Spanish election is really
settled hefo e the voting takes place. It is a fore-
gone conclusion that the nominees of a particular
group will he elected ; so that a prospective deputy '
task is simply fo get himself nominated by the most
powerful committee. A large number of deputies


regard their posts as sinecures; and the Cabinets
formed from the Cortes exaggerate their defects It
would be wrong to say that the community dislikes
the system: it has merely ignored it; with the re-
sult that when a series of disasters abroad made the
civilian Ministers unpopular, the representative bodies
were dismissed at the will of a military commander,
without sufficient disturbance to break a pane of glass.
If it was said that Australia’s Parliamentary
system has long ceased to be truly repre-
sentative, and is degenerating further every
year, there would be a press uproar, insti-
gated by those who stand to lose by the
promulgation of the truth. Actually, how-
ever, our position is little more democratic
than that of Spain, and here as there the
peril of it is ignored. It was not so in the
period shortly before the war, when the star-
chamber methods of Labor were the most
effective weapons in the controversial armory
of Liberalism. The rise of Hughesism pro-
duced a cross between the Labor and anti-
Labor machines which soon developed the
worst failings of both. Modern Nationalism
is as despotic as Labor, and it carries with it
a flavor of financial corruption on a large
scale, coupled with a disposition to hush up
serious scandals —a disposition from which
Labor, with all its faults, is free. Neither
party provides a reflection of the people who
are supposed to be behind it, either in Par-
liament or at executive headquarters. _ Any-
one who moves in that real world which is
outside the atmosphere of party intrigue and
cant knows Labor—real Labor —to have
been as unfriendly all along to the cause of
Victoria’s mutinous policemen as Conserva-
tism was. Yet judging by the Parliamentary
oration of the leader of the party in Victoria
the working classes there are in sympathy
with these servants of the State who, for a
trivial reason, put the law-abiding poor at
the mercy of criminals. The explanation is
to be sought at the Trades Hall, where,
shortly before P'rendekgast spoke, the
Council had announced that “the whole re-
sources of Labor would be employed to
enable the police to bring their strike to an
honorable conclusion.” By Labor he, of
course, meant the Council —a widely differ-
ent affair. Sometimes —again, as in Spain
—the lever that motivates the Parliamentary
machine is not a quasi-political council or
committee, but a more or less churcli-run
organisation with a special axe to grind.
Machine government is as vulnerable as any
other form of despotism: at the first sign
of trouble a capable revolutionary leader
can upset it “without sufficient disturbance
to break a pane of glass.” Unfortunately
more than glass is broken in the effort to
struggle back to constitutionalism —as Aus-
tralia may know unless it wakes up and puts
a curb on the political wire-pullers who are
giving it Parliamentarianism without repre-
sentation.

Cheapness Comes Home to Roost.
An insider discusses the police strike: —
Muddle and indecision, so characteristic of the .
rotation of Lawson Governments, has landed Vic-
toria in this mess with its police.
Driven by miserable wages, to which few perks
and no pensions were attached, the quality of the
force has been going down for years. Four years
ago, with the establishment of the Police Associa-
tion, conditions were improved; and in response to
public as well as party pressure the Government
lately had a project in hand further to better the
bcbhy’s lot and to restore his pension. But even
with his improved pay the Victorian policeman is
still the lowest valued of Australian guardians oE
the public safety.
Of course, Melbourne was staggered. For a police-
man to strike was unthinkable: one of “the things
not done.” Twenty years ago —nay, pe haps, ten -
the thing would have been unthinkable within the
force; but since then its quality has fallen. Its
average approaches that of the average worker ; in-
deed, nearly that of the unskilled laborer.
The more machine-built of union methods now
attract the rank and file' they flirt with, where in
the past they would have been horrified at, talk of
direct action. Members of the force may be seen
on friendly terms with the lurking “shrewdie”
which hangs about street corners, and is a mine of
information on race-tips and horse-fo m. Their
women acquaintanceship is en suite. This cultiva-
tion of the wrong sort of friend was so pronounced
a few months ago in the licensing branch that the
Chief Commissioner made a clean sweep of the
branch. There was nearly a strike then, and it is
more than coincidence that a constable, most con-
spicuous on that occasion, was one who is con-
spicuous on this. He defied orders then, but won
on a technicality of police regulation.
Followed then the appointment of a quartette of
supervising senior-constables. These were additional
to the regular sub-officers in charge of patrols. They
had a roving commission which embraced all cen-
tral Melbourne, the seat of the present upheaval,
and they roved in plain clothes. How efficient was
the innovation is proved by the hat ed the squad
engendered. Hatred rose to such a pitch that re-
cently the squad—known to police and public as
the “spooks”—were bidden take unifonns again so
that their “spying” should be less disguised.
The spooks were the idea of Nicholson, the
risen-from-the-ranks Chief Commissioner. His ap-
pointment followed the experiment of two Commis-
sioners from outside the service— George Steward
and Gellibrand, ex-General of A.I.F. The experi-
ments were not conspicuously successful; in fact,
within the force it was hinted that one died and
the other resigned at very lucky times for their
reputations as administrators and rulers of men.
Steward was for making changes, and, in a fo>ce
in which 20 years must pass before a constable has
hope of receiving his first promotion-stripe, change
is disliked-. Steward found himself up against the
deadweight of the force. Gellibrand wanted more
police and better-paid police. The Government
shilly-shallied, and Gellibrand went back to his
Tasmanian orchard.
When the Government turned next to the task
of choosing a Chief Commissioner the Police Associa-
tion made representations in favor of a Commissioner
from within the service, holding that such an officer
would command the loyalty of the force better
than an outsider, and that he would understand both
the working of the service and the psychology of
the men. How well he appreciated the last two
is shown in his appointment of the spooks, now
charged against him as “Prussianisih.” Apparently
the rankers want it both ways: a Commissioner who
will understand what they want, and who will not
ask them to do anything they do not like! At
any rate, the fact remains that never has unrest
so come to a head as under Nicholson.
Victorian police-officers rise quickly once they
have obtained their third stripe. Sub-inspector,
inspector, superintendent and “out” (upon reaching
60 years) follow. Seniority is a god in the force,
and when Time and Death are working long shifts
it is possible for an officer to rise from sergeant to
superintendent in as little as two years. Aery
few years ago Nicholson, now Chief Commissioner,
was a sergeant at Ballarat, prosecuting footpath
cyclists and “moving on” pavement loiterers. Made
inspector, he went back there. He had hardly be-
come used to the title of superintendent when as
senior superintendent he was chosen Chief Com-
missioner and became virtually of the inner circle
of the Government, and by reason of his office
a power in Melbourne affairs, with 2000 men
under him. The translation was a revolution, but
the man remained the sergeant. Years of Chief
Commissionership have not advanced him far.
The Chief is a quiet, friendly-natured man. it
needs no test of the imagination to picture him
over a watch-house fire swapping reminiscences of
mounted-constable days in the country with con-
temporaries now rankers still, gladly answering
“Arthur” to their “Jack” or “Jim.” In con-
versation he gives the impression of being con-
strained and lonely in his job. He comes of an
age in which members of the force were of the
intelligentsia, and he comes from the country where
members of the force were guides, counsellors and
friends to a whole district of staunch conservative
people. Faced by the truculent trades-union, towns-
man type of organised policeman, he is not sure
of himself, but is commanding and conceding in
turn. First tackled by the mischief-makers he
blustered; then, when trouble was evident, he
called in his spooks as a means of sparring for time.
The strikers realised his weakness, and, knowing
the indecision which curses all the Lawson Gov-
ernment’s doings, bluffed for more, and succeeded
in turning what might have been a skirmish by
snipers into a demonstration in force.
When Nicholson went down to address the
mutinous night-patrol, he met a crowd of young
constables “who knew not Nicholson,” and he was
counted out as though he had been an M.P. or
capitalistic tendencies. The fetich of the influence
which goes with a Commissioner from within the
service crashed there and then in the police yard at
Russell-etrdet. Nicholson's contemporaries would
have stood by Nicholson for old times’ sake and
the force’s esprit de corps: to the constable of the
newer order he was merely a boss, and therefore
one to be hated. It was a saddening experience,
and the ranker Chief felt it keenly.
®
The Strike Bane and a Possible Antidote.
A significant feature of the Melbourne
police strike was that the men who came out
soonest and talked defiance longest were not
on the pension-list. A mutiny is almost un-
thinkable in the R.N. of to-day, not because
sailors are of different clay from other em-
ployees, not because they ' have fewer griev-
ances, not even because the virtues of loyalty
and the dangers of disloyalty are continually
being impressed on the lower deck, but chiefly
because the Navy enjoys a generous pension-
system. The deferred pay arrangement of
the R.A.N. has the same soothing effect, its
only disadvantage as compared with the R.N.
device being that, whereas the British system
encourages men to end their active careers
at sea, ours tempts them to collect lump sums
and get out just as they have learned their
work. In the industrial sphere it is the
unmarried man who in every dispute clamors
for drastic action, while to the boy-worker
a strike is a blessed affair, combining the
pleasures of a holiday and the zest of
honorable class warfare. The elderly worker
with a family and perhaps a time-payment
cottage is the dread of revolutionaries of the
Tom Walsh type. For one thing he suffers
no illusions in regard to either the profit or
the glory of strikes. In memory’s .eye he
reviews past big upheavals—the A ictorian
railway strike of 20 years ago, the Brisbane
tramway strike of 1912, the N. S. AA r ales dis-
pute over the card system in 1917 as a result
of which the men lost 2 j millions in wages—
and almost always he recalls that, whatever
the ultimate benefits to the cause, the imme-
diate reward of the protesting toilers con-
sisted of personal discomfort and public
objurgations. So he goes into every strike
with his heels draggiiig, and often with the
reproaches of his wife sounding in his
troubled ears. If lie were imperilling a pen-
sion it would take a veritable master of the
art of strike-fomentation to satisfy him of the
need of downing tools; and where the pen-
sion was of a generous nature, even a master
might find the task too big. During last year
in Australia, according to the “Commonwealth
Year Book,” 692,074 working-days were lost
through strikes, etc., the number of workers
involved being 112,282. It was mentioned at
last week’s meeting of the N. S. Wales Em-
ployers’ Federation that “from the beginning
of 1919 to August 1 last, the miners at the
Newcastle and Maitland collieries alone lost
£2,647,725 in wages owing to strikes” ; and
the speaker went on : “To take only the first
seven months of this year the wages lost
totalled £1,238,631, and the tonnage lost
2,138,864.”. Putting aside the want and
misery created in working-class homes by
these largely senseless industrial wars,
they thus represent a large loss to
the employer. Admittedly, the pension-
system is not applicable to every industry
and occupation : the odd-jobber cannot hope
to benefit by it. And, admittedly also, as
the C.S.R. iias discovered, it is not a com-
plete protection against strikes. But it is
applicable to a vast number of men, and it
is a very considerable safeguard against
strikes. It would surely, therefore, be worth
the while of Australian employers to con-
sider whether it would not pay them to go
much further in the direction of establishing
pension funds than they have so far done.
It is a matter for the employer and not for
the State; if the State comes in it can only
regard the workman as a workman, whereas
the thing to be aimed at is to bind the em-
ployee to one particular employment. And
it is not a matter for direct co-operation be-
tween the employer and the employee either,
because if the pension fund is built up by
their joint contributions there can hardly be
a question of complete forfeiture on the occur-
rence of a strike. Certainly it is very doubt-
ful whether any Australian legislature would
permit of deductions being made from a
workman’s pay to purchase a pension that
would be forfeitable in such an event.
Slum Yearnings.
Fok density of population the unlovely sub-
urb of St. Peters ranks only 16th among
the 41 municipalities which make up the
N.S.AY. metropolis; that is to say, there are
15 worse cases. Considering that the saint
(the only one in the crowd) had. on census
day, 1418 denizens per 100 acres, while its
worst neighbor, Darlington, had 8291, it
really has a long way to go yet. Still it
lias got to the point of permitting the erec-
tion of homes on 24ft. allotments, if per-
pendicular coffins of that sort can be called
homes, and W. M. Hughes, in his old role
of the unpractical philanthropist with no-
thing to suggest but a lot to say, waxed elo-
quent about the matter. This was his
text
if Australia wants sane government, if it wants
to combat Bolshevism, strikes and go-slow, then it
must pay the price, and amongst other things sweep
away ali slums and mean unlovely hovels, and house
tne workers of the Commonwealth in a manner be-
fitting- free citizens oi a great and rich country.
The essential point is that no one in all the
world has discovered how to have huge cities
without housing the workers in a manner
quite unbefitting the free citizens of a free
and rich country, or any other citizens, or
any other country. Aliy place is a slum,
whatever its outward varnish, if sufficiently
overcrowded, and the problem of locating
the toiler close alongside his job, and yet
so far from his job that he can live the
hygienic life in or on the edge of the country,
has baffled the most profound thinkers.
There are plenty of cities where the work-
ing family is ofteh housed not on 24ft. but
on 4ft. of land, that or less being its share
of the space on which the tenement-house
reposes its murky bulk. Sydney is coming
to that, though quite needlessly, as there are
outside the metropolis 308,769 square miles of
country with some 84 inhabitants per square
mile on which to build relief cities, and
deserted harbors are calling out for settle-
ment. Everything possible is done, by rail-
way management especially, to encourage
the present unnatural condition of affairs,
and this encouragement is due, among other
things, to the hypocrisy, ignorance or indif-
ference of posing philanthropists to whom
the horrors of congestion are really a valu-
able stock-in-trade. The cases of Brisbane,
Melbourne and Adelaide have proved that
new State capitals are new centres of popu-
lation. which must needs relieve the pressure
on old centres, and an extension of the idea
is strongly urged. The example of Maori-
land, with four fairly equal cities, and many
prosperous towns, but no really big city and
no slums, on an area little larger than V ic-
toria, suggests that when ports receive equal
treatment in the matter of railway accom-
modation, a diffusion of population such as
is undreamt of in Australia comes about
quite naturally. These instances give rise
to the view that decentralisation —the diffu-
sion of population, and the consequent put-
ting of fewer people on one spot, or even
the removal of some of them from the spot
is the remedy for overcrowding, for 24ft.
allotments, and for the tenement-house habit
which follows. And nobody has dug out of
his inner thought or out of the experience of
other lands any other remedy. The pallid
hygienic philanthropist hasn’t. And there is
little hope in the politician who drew Minis-
terial salary for over a dozen years yet did
nothing, and who is passionately assured,
now that Ministerial salary has stopped, that
someone else should do something, but doesn t
say what.
The N.S.W. Crimes Act.
Another lawyer’s analysis of Attorney-
General Bavin’s amending bilf: —
The trials of offences against the law may be
divided into two classes. The accused may be tried
by a magistrate or by a Judge and jury. Trial
by a magistrate usually takes place a few days
after the occurrence out of which the charge arises;
the magistrate hears ■ the evidence oh both sides, de-
cides whether the accused is guilty or innocent, and,
if guilty, awards punishment. The magistrate is
a moderately paid official, the prosecutor is usually
a police officer, and the business is put through
without waste of time or undue expense to the
community. In the case of a trial by a Judge and
jury, the accused is first of all brought before a
magistrate, and if sufficient evidence is forthcoming
to establish a prima facie case against him, the
magistrate commits him for trial and fixes the
amount of bail required or refuses to allow bail.
If the accused cannot get sureties to go bail for
him, or if the magistrate refuses to allow bail, l e
must spend the time between his committal and
trial in custody at the expense of the State. After
committal the depositions are forwarded to the Crown
Law authorities; they draw up an indictment, and
the Crown Prosecutor goes carefully through the
case. The witnesses are bound over to appear, and
provision must be made to secure their attendance
and pay their expenses. The jury must be duly
summoned. All the cumbrous machinery designed
for the fair trial of important issues must be set
in motion. It may be a month or two before the
matter eventually comes' on for hearing before a
Judge and jury, and the case costs the country
perhaps 10 times as much as if it had been sum-
marily disposed of by a magistrate.
Roughly, the idea underlying these two methods
of trial is that a magistrate deals with minor offences
—for example, omitting to register a dog—while
the Judge and jury try serious crimes, such as arson,
forgery, murder. Most of us have heard stories
about people having been sent out as convicts for
what we should not consider very serious offences
riowadays. Some very trifling breaches of the law-
still rank as indictable offences, and come within
the class triable by Judge and jury; for example,
stealing a couple of apples does not shock our feel-
ings as an abhorrent crime, nevertheless it is still
larceny and an indictable offence. “Two apples’’
is not an exaggerated example; only a month or
two ago a man accused of stealing exactly that—
two apples-—insisted on His right to be tried by
a jury. In the evolution of our laws many trans-
gressions that current public opinion would class as
minor offences are still left in the serious-crime
class. Some attempt to meet this difficulty has
been made by the summary jurisdiction sections
of the Crimes Act, the effect of which is that, if
a person accused of an indictable offence consents,
and if the subject matter involved is less than £2O,
the magistrate may proceed to deal with the case
without having to send on the accused for trial by
a jury. If the accused considers that he has little
chance of an acquittal before a magistrate, he natu-
rally reserves his defence and elects to go on for
trial before a jury. Some of the cases that come
before a jury nowadays are reminiscent of Heath
Robinson’s picture, “How to Crack a Monkey Nut,’’
or some such absurdity—a picture of exaggerated
cranes and levers to accomplish what a small boy
does with the first convenient pebble or the heel
of his boot.
The general effect of Mr. Bavin’s bill is to demote
a number of comparatively unimportant breaches of
the law that have been left sti'anded in the serious-
crimes class triable before a jury to the minor-
offences class triable before a magistrate, to which
they properly belong. The Crimes Act of 1900
already provides for the trial before a magistrate
instead of a jury of a large number of breaches of
the law, as anyone can see who' looks up sections
493 onwards. Nearly all the recent Acts creating
offences provide that they should be dealt with b'y
a magistrate. That is the general tendency of
modern law-making. Against the rights of the
accused have to be weighed the rights of the public,
the inconvenience to jurymen and witnesses, the
expense to the community, and the axiom that speed}
justice is always better than deferred justice. Some
of the offences at present triable by a magistrate
are far more serious than others that the law, as
handed down to us by our ancestors, makes triable
bv a jury only. If the complaint is that this new
bill infringes the liberty of the subject, an answer
can be made that that liberty is already seriously
infringed by the old 1900 Crimes Act and pretty
well every criminal statute for the last 50 years.
The new amendment of the Crimes Act does not,
as has been alleged, make it compulsory dn all
criminal charges involving property to the value of
£IOO or less for the accused to be summarily dealt
with by a bench of two magistrates. What it does
is to extend the jurisdiction of the magistrates,
where the accused consents to his case being disposed
of summarily, from £2O to £IOO, in which cases
the magistrate has power to impose up to 12 month-
imprisonment or fine up to £SO. It provides for
a compulsory jurisdiction without the consent of
the accused, not for all criminal charges, but only
for a certain class, mainly small thefts, where tne
property involved does not exceed £SO, and the
punishment that may be awarded under it is impri-
sonment not exceeding 12 months or a fine not
exceeding £SO. There is the additional safeguard
that there is always the right of appeal from a
conviction by a magistrate by way of rehearing
before a Court of Quarter Sessions. So, therefore,
if we commit bigamy or murder our mother-in-law,
we shall still retain our old privilege of having
our case tried by a jury. Apart from the extension
of the magistrate’s jurisdiction, which, though it
has been given all the limelight, is a relatively
unimportant alteration, the new bill brings the
law up to date with modern ideas in many other
respects appreciable by any criminal lawyer.

Mental and Other Wanderings in the
North.
There was no redeeming feature in the tale
of muddle and despair that the Federal
Public Works Committee brought back from
Northern Australia, but there were streaks
of grim humor. The North is the natural
and ripened product of the Big State system,
which involves the direct control of great
areas from long distances. Darwin, gov-
erned from Melbourne, 3010 miles away,
when the late Prime Minister wasn’t guiding
its destinies from London; Wyndham, steered
from Perth, 1960 miles distant; and casual
spots like Burketown, managed from Bris-
bane at 1480 miles range—these are a few
samples among many. The first named, being
the most distant, having the least political
pull in the way of votes to sell, and having
been controlled directly for most of its Fed-
eral existence by Hughes, is naturally the
greatest disappointment. A summary of the
case, attributed to Gregory of Westralia,
chairman of the official and inquiring wan-
derers, read thus:—
Notwithstanding the large capital expenditure in
the Territory the population is less to-day than when
the Commonwealth took it over from S. Australia.
The boastful Socialistic enterprises have turned out
dismal failures, ruining the lives of many courageous
pioneers. Rich minine- areas have had to be aban-
doned. The pastoral industry is in a worse condi-
tion than at any previous • time in its history We
have shown absolute incapacity. The North to-day
is a veritable white elephant, without trade, with-
out production, and without people other than
Government servants, their dependants and those
living on Government doles. The pastoral industry
is moribund, mining is practically non-existent, and
tropical culture is impossible under present condi-
tions.
It is mentioned, of course, that the cotton
potentialities are indefinitely large ; but, then,
cotton requires means of transport as badly
as wheat, and it hasn’t got them. It begins
to be realised, too, that the wool sheep (as
distinct from the meat sheep), Australia’s
most reliable natural product up to date,
can be cultivated in a greater variety of
climates than has been popularly supposed. Up
by Burketown and the Flinders, close to the
Gulf of Carpentaria, men who have come to
hate the. sight of a bullock have begun to pan- •
der to the merino, jumbuck, and the result is
said to be satisfactory—save for the difficulty
in shifting the product. It is alleged that, in
Northern Westralia and the Northern Terri-
tory, there are “millions of acres” capable
of carrying one woolly animal to the acre;
but the eternal difficulty of carrying wool
and stores and human beings gets in the road
there also. About the riches of the Terri-
tory’s great mineral belt there is no dispute,
and the opening of a rich mining field is
the shortest cut to settlement —to permanent
settlement if the country has lawful visible
means of support to fall back upon in later
years. But even splendid Ivalgoorlie, though
it is only a stone’s throw from the sea at
Esperance Bay (provided the stone is thrown
far enough), required a railway, the difficulty
of dragging enormous masses of machinery
by meat-power having a tendency to discount
the richest field after the surface nuggets
have been gathered in. All these matters
being kept •in view, it was an anti-climax
when chairman Gregory (of Westralia, of
course) prescribed, as an all-round remedy,
the building of a Federal railway from
Broome in his own State, across his own
State, touching as lightly as possible on the
Federally-owned Territory, and finally tra-
versing the property of his friend Theodore
to the impossible port of Townsville (Q.).
The idea of peopling the Territory by hitching
it on one side to the hamlet of Broome, 1374
miles by sea from even a minor capital, and
on the other side to a bad port and a small
town 748. miles by sea from another minor
capital, reminds this paper that it has a
great scheme for providing Sydney with
whales by duplicating the line to Bourke and
pushing the Cobar line on to the next wire-
fence.

Poincare.
“St. Heeier” puts the case against Poin-
care :
In “Poincare and His Critics” (B. l/11/’23)
the proposition is laid down that France and its
Prime Minister are likely to know their Germany
“and the psychology of the Germans” a great deal
better than the average Australian. That is, no
double, incontrovertible. But couldn’t an equally
overwhelming case be made out for’ the even more
relevant contention that Britain and its Prime Minis-
ter are likely to know their France, and their
Poincare, and the psychology of their cross-Channel

neighbors a great deni better than the average
Australian, ton?
And in this matter it is not a question of the
British Prime Minister and the dominant party in
Parliament alone : the opposition to the French occu-
pation of the Ruhr, the resentment at such a policy
being embarked upon without the acquiescence of the
Allies, to whom France owes everything, the ques-
tioning of its efficacy, even the doubt as to: .its
actual legality under the Treaty of Versailles —these
are shared in more or less degree, and have been
voiced freely, by all parties in Britain. If there is
a single public man of prominence and note who
has definitely and distinctly expressed himself as out
of step with the national refusal to endorse or
approve France’s action, the cables ar e singularly
silent about him. There are four parties in the House
of Commons, but the spokesmen of no single one of
them have expressed anything except downright con-
demnation of France’s lone-hand action in the Ruhr.
Isn’t this unanimity in itself the best possible proof
that the question in England is not regarded as a
party one at all, or as a means by which Govern-
ments can be upset? Has there, in fact, been any
such standing sliouldcr-to-slioulder on any momentous
issue since the fateful days of August, 1914? Prime
Minister Baldwin lias not swerved from the attitude
of his predecessor, the just-deceased Boxak Law.
Lloyd Georue, the head of the Coalition Government
which the present Ministry displaced, so far from
trying to make capital out of the Bonau Law-
Baldwin view of Poincare's action, lias gone further
than either in his plain speaking to France.
Asquith is somewhat silent nowadays, but it was
he who suggested years ago that the reconstruction
of Europe would be best effected by “writing off”
all reparations bills. Henderson and Thomas, the
Labor leaders, have found it no cause of offence in
a Tory Government that it uncompromisingly pro-
tested against the Ruhr enterprise; they have,
indeed, added their own protests to those of their
lifelong political opponents. Is all this solid body
of opinion in Great Britain, without mentioning that
of the representatives of Greater Britain now in
London, including General Smuts, to go for nothing
with Australians because Poincare “has a special
knowledge of Germans” ? Are we to be compelled
to view them through French glasses ? Is the French
viewpoint the only one, or even the one that con-
cerns Australia most ? Isn’t it judicious for Aus-
tralians to try to get some appreciation of French
psychology, too?
According to the London Daily Chronicle (not
a Ministerial organ, by the way) there has been
something like a campaign of misrepresentation and
abuse of England in a large section of the French
press since the Ruhr trouble became acute. It was
felt and proclaimed as an added grievance against
England, the Chronicle representative in France
noted last August, that the British Government had
made arrangements to pay off the British war-
time debt to the United States. Franco, which
owes Britain six hundred mil'iions-odd, and has
shown no intention of considering even whether she
can pay the interest unless she can get something
out of Germany, evidently felt that a bad precedent
had been established by Britain regarding a war-
time debt as a sacred obligation (even when it was
not incurred for her own needs) and taxing herself
inexorably and relentlessly to defray it in a fixed
term of years.
As to which, in a few words
The Bulletin in its Poincare article was con-
cerned with neither politics nor ethics, but with
facts a vital point. Frenchmen, and particularly
I roneli statesmen, not only know more about Ger-
mans than the average Australian does; they know
far more than most English statesmen —on the
principle that policemen are better acquainted with
the habits of burglars than laymen can be expected
to be.
Unquestionably it is in the immediate financial
interests of Britain that Germany should be treated
tenderly. The French Premier recognised that in
his note to Lord Crf.we on August 20 last, but at
the same time he put the French view: “No doubt
it is a British interest that Germany should be
raised up; yet it certainly cannot be a British
interest that France should be brought lower.”
The realisation by France that successive British
Governments have been to an extent pro-German has
caused bitterness and the usual reactions in the
Paris press. (Incidentally, the peace-time Paris
papers are chronically anti-British, though not nearly
so much so as those of Germany, Spain and Italy.)
But if newspapers reflect the sentiments of the
Public, then is the Baldwin Government nearly as
wrong over the Ruhr as the Lloyd-George admini-
stration was over Ireland. With the exception of
the new Times, the Chronicle and the “Cocoa Press”
almost every big paper in the kingdom is pro-French.
To quote a disgusted phrase from the pacifist Nation :
“It has seemed that the whole British nation is
screaming ‘Hats off to France!’”
Hoax.
A dept t tation recently waited on N. S.
Wales Minister Oakes on the subject of
venereal disease, with results that bore the
same proportion to the necessities of the case
that a mite does to an almighty. The Law
says that if a V.D. patient gets into gaol he
may be detained for treatment even after his
sentence has expired. Also. V.D. patients are
required to get treatment from a qualified
man, not a quack; and the qualified man is
supposed to notify the Health Department
of the existence of the case, so that the
patient may not disappear and spread infec-
tion far and wide. That is to say. V.D. be-
came legally notifiable on a certain date dur-
ing the career of the Storey-Dooley Govern-
ment, and, the things mentioned being seen
to. the Ala State was to become a civilised
spot in a hygienic sense. But the laziest
Minister ever born said that he wouldn’t en-
force the law. and there is no penalty for a
high-salaried Minister who says and does
things like that. He can't even be given
three years for getting pay under false pre-
tences. And. unfortunately, laziness isn't a
notifiable complaint unless the patient gets
to that point of inertia at which he falls
asleep on the tramline. Money was found
in abundance by this Government to support
the strike and stoppage of production at
Broken I3ill, but big questions regarding the
preservation of the national health found the
Dooleys torpid, or else at the races. The
deputation which called on the new
Government mentioned a few measures
which might be called urgent. They
included the establishment of sufficient
hospitals for the treatment of cases, the en-
forcement of the notification law. and the
necessity for both parties to a marriage hav-
ing a clean bill of health and thus ensuring
the prospective infant a fair start in life. The
sum mentioned as necessary was £150,000,
which is about what the Government is ready
to drop any day of the* week on extending
some railway which has been losing money
for 50 years, and carrying it through a few

miles of inferior lien-country to a pocket in
the hills. And, astounding as it may seem,
the response of the Minister for Health,
C. W. Hoax, was a promise to increase the
annual vote for the treatment of syphilis
from £2500, the price of a Ministerial picnic,
to £5OOO, the price of two picnics. That kind
of incongruity suggests the case of the econo-
mist who, finding his soul in mortal peril,
attempted to buy sixpenn’orth of salvation.
The sleepy, moth-eaten futility of Australia
House, London, was made manifest lately by
one of the tribe of land-jobbers. He had land
outside the Federal territory at Canberra and
Jervis Bay. To promote business he took
an office in Australia House, and from there
began to issue advertisements like this:—
One pound per month will purchase a lot at
Canberra, the new Federal Capital City, where the
Australian Government, is now 7 spending millions.
A wonderfully profitable investment without trouble.
Particulars from So-and-So (established 37 years),
Australia House, Strand.
There was a similar offer of land at Jervis
Bay, “the port of Canberra, the new Capi-
tal City of the whole Continent of Australia,
where the Commonwealth Government is
now spending millions.” The address made
it look almost as official as if it had come
from Buckingham Palace or No. 10 Down-
ing-street. Officially, Australia House slept
on, quite unconscious of what was doing up-
stairs ; but someone in Australia got in
motion, and wanted to know what private
individual at the Government offices was
selling the Federal estate for £1 per month.
Telegrams were sent to Joseph Cook, bid-
ding him find out what was going on in his
own building. Presumably he did some-
thing, or something was done without him,
for the advertisement changed to something
like this:—
One pound per month will purchase the nearest
freehold to Canberra, the new Capital City for the
whole continent of Australia, where the very next
National Parliament is definitely to meet. The Gov-
ernment is spending millions in preparation, and
very rapid progress is assured, etc., etc.
The address is still at Australia House,
which is probably the only embassy in the
world that sells accommodation and the use
of its name and. dignity for such purposes.
After the first explosion it might have been
thought that the firm would have had to seek
a new address, but apparently that was not
the case. There is a lack of information as
to how much money was got while it was re-
presented that it was land at the capital itself
that was on offer. There is a scarcity of
news as to the situation and quality of the
land that is offering now. And there is
especially a lack of news as to the mental
agility of Joseph Cook while these things
were happening under his own roof. So far
every Australian ambassador has been an
old man who got the ambassadorial job just
prior to retirement, and whether he did well
or ill there was nothing ahead. So, as a
rule, he does badly or does nothing; and
liis staff naturally gets the habit of helping
him.
Bananai.and's State Enterprises have been
the cause of much hilarity of late years, but
the climax was attained when, in his latest
report, Commissioner Austin described how
his attempt to keep up prices was defeated
by certain nefarious meat-vendors, who in-
sisted on giving the public cheap meat
whether they wanted it or not. Here is how
the Labor Government’s Commissioner puts
it:—
From October, 1922, to January, 1923, however,
for the reasons shown hereunder, a substantial loss
was shown in our trading. During that period prices
of stock increased considerably, but in Brisbane and
some of the larger towns it was impossible to advance
prices, owing to the fact that certain cattle-owners
who had come into the business were retailing meat
at prices which were unpayable to those who were
compelled to buy their stock on the open market.
This is a fearful confession for a State Meat
Department to make. The State butcheries,
we were told, were initiated in order to cir-
cumvent these rascally private traders, and
compel them to keep down their prices. But
here it turns out that it is the private trader
who is compelling the State butcher to keep
down the price of beef. It is comforting,
however, to learn that the Commisioner has
hopes that these unscrupulous cattle-owners
will not be so foolish as to persist in cutting
prices, in which case it is only fair to assume,
from his own presentment of the case, that
he will have much pleasure in lifting prices
again. Meantime the private meat-shop
man is posing quite justifiably as the true
friend of the toiler who is out for cheap
sausages.
♦
“Ex-Dig.” makes some comforting remarks:
The N.S.AV. Water Conservation Board, which con-
trols the Murrumbidgee Irrigation areas, claims that
the ex-soldiers who are now applying for land are,
taken in the bulk, more suitable as settlers than
those who hove applied at any other time since the
war ended. It is a sign that we are getting back
to normal. The war drew away men from the city
and country alike. The city men, after an experi-
ence of freedom from the conventional restraints of
city employment, came back with a burning desire
to get away from it and make a living on the land;
the country men, having enjoyed the delights of the
city for the first time under the ideal conditions
of leave, decided they would like some more of
them. The result was a queer mix-up. For some
years past clerks and shop-assistants have, been
losing their ideals about the land and drifting- away
from it, and, though perhaps more slowly, disillu-
sioned country men are turning their backs on the
city. It has been an expensive business for the
Australian taxpayer, and it is going to be an
expensive business for the present taxpayer's son and
possibly his grandson; but there is some comfort
in the reflection that we have at least started < o
recover from our war-time drunk.
On the making of Australian pictures:—
The mob that held-up Melbourne that wild Saturday
night was largely composed of youngsters in their
teens. Concerning which Jones, Labor leader in
the Leg. Council, said: “Many of the films imported
from America do no good to young people. They
depict lawlessness and disorder, and create a psy-
chology which leads young people to acts of reckless
behavior.” It might have been better expressed,
but it is a true bill. Also, it is another point in
favor of encouraging the production of films that
won't present fancy pictures of crime and the crim-
inal classes, or incite kids to destroy themselves by
methods they have seen on the screen —yet another
case of that sort was reported at the week-end.
But Gibson, the Amalgamation man, has been assur-
ing the Tariff Boa d that we can’t expect to make
films in Australia. The “difficulties” are too “enor-
mous” to be overcome by the people whose soldiers
stepped the Huns at Ville-s-Bretonneux and drove
them off Mont St. Quentin. We haven’t the money, the
intelligence or the enterprise, we poor devils of Aus-
tralians. That is the story now; but in a publica-
tion issued by Gibson’s Amalgamation two years
ago, some interesting other statements were made. Aus-
tralasian Films (Gibson is general manager) and
Union Theatres (Gibson is one of the three managing
directors) “represent,” along with the J. C. William-
son interests, a capital of over £3,000,000. The
Amalgamation was about to build “three million-
dollar theatres,” and had also decided to “locally pro-
duce films in a big way.” In this connection, it pos-
sessed “easily the finest studio and laboratory in
the Southern Hemisphere... .an ideal situation for
the making of motion-pictures,” and appurtenances
“equal to any demands... .modern to a degree
able to cope with the requirements of the biggest
casts.” As for actors, there were the J. C. William-
son forces, which had supplied America with some
of its brightest stars. (This wasn’t expressly stated,
but it was understood.) The Bulletin’s copy of
this brochure is at the Tariff Board’s disposal if it
wants to compare Gibson the optimist with Gib-
son the dejected pessimist.

The present situation is that five States —
N. S. Wales, Queensland, Westralia, S.A.
and Victoria —are offering 5j per cent,
for loan money, and as there isn’t enough
of the commodity to go round, one of them
will probably jump a point presently to sf.
Already some or all of them are making the
interest free of income-tax; and that conces-
sion is worth 2 p.c. to rich investors. So
the business has become an auction, and the
debt goes to the highest bidder. The proceeds
are mostly dropped down holes which are
dotted all over the country. Westralia has
a State “fleet” of three steamers, which has
just proved its ability to lose £78,757 in a
year; Victoria has £2,000,000 of arrears
already due to it by people whom it
“closer settled” out of loans; and N. S..
Wales has railways which are costing the
taxpayer £2 per yard per annum. Behind
all this is the spectre of the millions of debt
that is falling due. Naturally for renewing
these lOU’s the holders want as much as the
States are paying for new money; so the mad
competition is affecting far more than the
price of the new loans.
Prophecy is a profitless business, and the
ways of the astute Teuton are tortuous;
still, it is difficult to believe that the Great
Hun Sham can last much longer. The war
left Germany the only important combatant
on the continent of Europe whose factories,
workshops, mines and farms were intact —-
the only one that could resume money-earn-
ing at the old address without delay. Though
it lost some territory it had the biggest
known coal reserves on the continent, and
everything else that the manufacturer could
desire. It didn’t lose much by paying in-
demnities—in fact, it stopped paying early.
Now the pretence is made that the occupa-
tion (ouite a polite and gentlemanly one) of
a small corner of the country has caused
every vestige of coin to vanish, and rendered
the paper money valueless, and made the
payment of even a cab-fare impossible. It
is a question whether the imitation isn’t
too realistic, like the hue of the artificial
nigger who was so much blacker than any
real nigger that he left stains wherever he
sat down.
Edith Cowan, M.L.A., who is much more
intelligent than the average lie-politician and
a far more cultured and interesting speaker,
has been baited into this dignified remon-
strance in the Westralian Assembly:—
I don’t know whether I am in order, but it does
seems to me that members should give me a fair
deal. There is always a considerable amount of inter-
ruption and Conversation around me when I am
speaking. I don’t wish to have to apologise to the
House in any way or to suggest that members are
other than gentlemen, but I would like a fiairer hear-
ing than members seem to be willing to give me as
a woman. I therefore appeal to you, Mr. Chairman,
to see that they keep order.
The chairman replied that he would, and
the House, in which “there had been a good
deal of talk and noise,” was shamed into
silence for the moment; but there were
more imbecile interruptions and bovine
laughter before the lady sat down. Then
Angwin, deputy-leader of the Opposition, ex-
plained that “all members, male or female,
are liable to have interjections thrown at
them.” If it is true, it is only because the
Westralian Assembly, like other popular
Houses, has become habituated to bad
manners.
Constituted Authority everywhere in Aus-
tralia should make a note of it that no Gov-
ernment can afford to be stingy or cantank-
erous or uncivil to the power that supports
the throne; and there being no State militia
here, as in the U.S., the police are that
power. The Melbourne police are under-
paid and (being too few) overworked. The
price of nearly murdering a “cop” is absurdly
small. Many of them buy their own re-
volvers out of their scanty earnings. And
it is hardly worth while to be either an intel-
ligent or a conscientious policeman merely for
the sake of bringing offenders before some
scared amateur J.P. Nothing can justify a
police strike in a democracy ; but it is just
as well to remove those evils which may be
wrongly taken to justify one. For an un-
justifiable punch on the nose can do just as
much harm as a punch that has been fully
earned.
The report of Auditor-General M. II.
Robertson on Bananaland’s State enter-
prises makes doleful reading. The accumu-
lated loss on these concerns on June 80 was
£626,748 as against £440,070 in the previous

At present it looks as if only desperate
measures can save the Fuller Government
from the wrath which N.S.W. Government
servants are preparing for it. These mea-
sures are: (1) Separate representation of
the Government servants, who otherwise will
present Dang with 20 seats; (2) drastic re-
trenchment, which everyone knows is neces-
sary, but which will never arrive until the
Government-service vote is segregated ; (3)
a substantial reduction of the income-tax;
(4) legislative consent to the formation of
new States —this if only to get the Pro-
gressives’ support. Then an appeal to the
electors on one issue—whether N. S. YV ales
is to be run by Government servants for
Government servants or by the people for
the people.
A low-spirited official document dealing
with Australian production (classified under
rural, mining and manufacturing) has been
issued. It alleges that, though the value of
production showed a gratifying increase from
218 millions (1913) to 347 millions (1922),
it was really only due to the fact that the
first set of values were gold and the second
paper. Measured by the gold standard, that
is, by quantity, says the pessimistic publi-
cation, the increase wasn’t 129 millions, but
14 millions —say a drop in production of £3
per inhabitant. In that case it looks as if
the, expenditure in these nine years of
£212,000,000 of loan money to develop the
country had missed fire. But when does
the loan superstition do anything else?
Figures of our trade with the United
States show that our tariff has ceased to
function properly. Australia has become a
mere dumping ground for Yankee goods, an
operation greatly helped because the balance
of exchange as well as the balance of trade
is agtinst us. A third factor is the activity
of the American combines which restrict
Australian imports into the United States.
Of course they are too badly in need of our
superior wool and hides to stop them coming
in, but anything else they produce them-
selves they keep out by a very high tariff
or by a ukase to American importers that
they'must not buy certain Australian com-
modities. This lopsided kind of business
can only be met and countered by something
approaching prohibition. Our home manu-
facturers will never fully supply our home
consumption so long as we let America trade
with us on its own terms.
Many of the looters caught red-handed
when the mob took charge of Melbourne
were youngsters who gave their occupation
as “laborers,” and the older thieves, with
very few exceptions, were also “laborers.”
Apropos, the Vic. Minister of Labor re-
cently announced that in 54 skilled trades
there were only 7309 apprentices, although
the employers were allowed 27,000 by wages-
board law. In the carpentering trade there
were 47 apprentices instead of > ,“ 0
164 bricklayers had mne lads working along
side them instead of 73. Employers who
have shirked their duty of giving boys the
moral discipline of a trade are to so
tent responsible for what happened on the
night of November 3. bo are P°bticia
whose centralisation policy has multiplied
the population of the Melbourne slums.
The Acting-Prime Minister created some
surprise by delivering an almost passionate
eulogy on Premier Theodore for his states-
man like action in reducing the cattlemen s
rents. If Theodore’s action looked like con-
trition, something of the sort might be under-
standable ; but there isn t the smallest sigi
of that. Iu fact, Theodore would no doubt
scornfully resent any such suggestion,. Put
Theodore has £25,000,000 of debt which he
will have to renew, and Earle Page s interest
in the matter is that lie will have to save
Theodore from smash if London won t. Ana
that, no doubt, explains the whitewash.
“Old Parliamentary Hand”: If Alec Pea-
cock had been as keen on peacemaking when
the Vic. police strike was a mere flash ot
anger on the part of 29 men as private-
member Peacock was 20 years ago when tne
railway strike was at its height, there wou <
have been no riots, murders, orgies, tires ana
looting. He let the nervy Lawson, the hys-
terical Robinson and the idea-less Allan run
the show till it was too late. On the criti-
cal day he was away with his amiable col-
league Gordon opening a school at Rusk-
worth. When he got back the mischief had
been done. But Peacock is 62 now and he
was only 42 in 1903. The energy which had
made him Premier at 40 has abated with
the years that have flown.
“Yarrum”: The piling up of the capital
cost of the railways by the multiplication ot
unpayable lines is having some queer conse-
quences. That and go-slow between them
have ,so pushed up freight charges that, in
a country where horseflesh is cheap and
fodder still cheaper, road-haulage easily beats
the rail. Ever since the Cooma (N.b.YV.)
line was opened, bullock-drays and horse-
teams have been carrying goods from the
Clyde to Braidwood. Bungendore, Quean-
bevan and Cooma. Also, tons and tons oi
stuff are being carted from Merimbula to •
Bombala and Nimmitabel. To see the
teams at Nelligen, Clyde River, any
Saturday, on the arrival of the lllawarra
Co’s steamer, one would think there was
no such thing as a railway anywhere adja-
cent.
“Solomon M.” : The hottest season being
over, the Spirit of Investigation is about to
take its life in its hand again, and have an-
other go at the treasure tomb of lutank-
liamen, the Pharaoh who has already killed
two intruders in defence of his solitude and
property. It is impossible to give him back
the solitude, but surely some compromise
could be arrived at in the matter of the pro-
perty. My idea is that all the gold should
be valued, and Egyptian bonds to. the same
amount buried in its stead. That is the way
Australian Treasurers lay the unquiet ghost
in the Savings Bank, and it has answered—
so far.
One reason why British capitalists take a
fatherly interest in Argentina is that they
have immense sums invested in private rail-
ways there, and the size of the dividend de-
pends on the country’s prosperity. When
times are bad the Argentine pays little
or nothing at all. .1. Bull has also im-
mense sums invested in Australian railways,
but the Australian contracts to pay a faxed
dividend whether times are good or bad, and
whether the money is earned or not. There
ought to be compensating advantages m
Australia’s policy; but the hungry politician
has throwm most of them away.
The growing tendency for Australians to
become dwellers in flats and sojourners in
boarding-houses is illustrated by some recent
figures from the Bureau of Statistics. Be-
tween 1911 and 1921 private houses increased
from 888,045 to 3,068,607, boarding-houses
from 14,387 to 27,665, flats from 6344 to
38,403. The rate of increase works out at
20' p.c. in the first case, 95 p.c. in the
second, 545 p.c. in the third. The growth
of the flat w-as most marked in Hobart,
among State capitals, and least pronounced
in Perth.
Mussolini, the speed-limit Dago, assumed
right off that Greece was responsible for the
slaying of certain Italians on the Greco-
Albanian border, and promptly sent 14 ships
which opened fire on a school on the Greek
coast, and killed the children; but still lie
thought it advisable to make a pretence of
inquiry. The Government of brigandish little
Albania replied to all questions promptly.
The Italians were killed, it said, in Greek
territory, by Greek subjects, who afterwards
took refuge in Greece, which was a complete
vindication of Albania’s peacable habits.
Later news from the seat of peace concerned
a Cabinet meeting at which the Albanian
Prime Minister opened fire on his colleagues,
wflio fled for their lives: but w-hether this
amounts to a political crisis in those festive
parts is not explained.
THE TROTTERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Speaking at the Overseas League, the Prince
of Wales urged the desirability of encouraging the
spirit of travel in statesmen.” — Cable.
Hence, ye pale Parliaments and deputations !
Avaunt the memo, and the rubber-stamp!
Not thus we labor for the good of nations;
Our place of office is upon the tramp !
How shall we serve Australia merely sitting
Beside a table and a blotting-pad?
We see the lights of Empire flitting, flitting;
And departmental Hi litters make us sad.
Roll up the swag! We’re moved by sternest duty
Once more to dare the sea arid cross the Line.
We seek afar for England, home and beauty—
There’s still perchance a sparkle in the wine.
There we shall meet our distant British cousin,
Whose Empire mission takes the same bold style,
And find a noble prince—or half a dozen—
And bask a moment in the royal smile.
Far better this than merely viewing matters
That touch Australia in the rawest place.
Let us be found where holy Israel scatters
Large loans to bear the interest of our race.
Did someone say that ther e are lands to travel
Within the compass of our own wide shore,
And tangled problems that we might unravel
A short car-journey from the office door ?
Well, so there are; but when an Empire calls us
We cannot linger with the things we know;
We needs must rush around, whate’er befalls us,
And banquet at the centre of the show.
Although Australia’s needs a re somewhat ample,
From duty’s sterner path we dare not. wince.
Move on! We follow precept and example.-
We trot for Empire with its trotting prince.

The past half’s profits were the Royal's best,
not only in size but in relation to capital.
Just prior to the war the bank was employ-
ing - £300,000 of capital and earning 15.4 p.c.
p.a. on it; capital nowadays is £750,000, and
is earning 16.4 p.c. But the improvement
is not quite so good if reserves invested in
the business are taken into consideration;
there is now £576,305 at work compared with
£217,000-odd in 1914; and on total funds
disclosed net profits are now returning 9.3
p.c. against 8.8 p.c. 10 years ago. The Royal
is one of the smaller Australian banks, but
has developed rapidly in recent years. It
began business just prior to the Melbourne
smash, and the troubles of subsequent years,
combined with the fact that the bank was
young and untried, did not give it much
chance to grow. Down to 1906 shareholders
received only 6 p.c. ,divs., but meanwhile
large surpluses were laid aside to make the
future easier. War conditions made new
opportunities, of which a Board with power-
ful commercial influence did not fail to
take advantage, and gross profits and work-
ing exes, bounded ahead in this way for Sep-
tember half-years:—•

1923 . . . . 105.890 44,247
The gross profit for the past six months was
almost three times that for the September
half of 1914. The co. is now distributing
£75,000 p.a. to shareholders compared with
only £24,000 five years backhand the 10 p.c.
on the larger capital is earned so easily that
for the past 12 months 12s. Bd. was left in
reserves for every £1 paid to shareholders.
At the September, 1914, balance £2,259,902
of deposits were held; six years later the
figures had expanded to £4,420,294. Of
course, war inflation affected banking
movements, but apart from that influence
this bank made solid progress. During the
past three years of readjustment to more
normal conditions the growth of deposits has
not been so rapid : at September 30 last they
totalled £4,858,257. Here are further de-
tails :—•

The. new shares issued during the war period
have maintained the Royal’s strong position.
At the latest balance all outside liabilities
slightly exceeded 54 millions; capital and
reserves totalled £1,326,305. Thus not quite
£4 of the public’s money was held for every
£1 of the bank’s own, and anything up to 8
to 1 is generally regarded as a safe working-
basis for Australian banks. This means that
the Royal management can continue to seek
considerable new business without calling for
the assistance of additional funds from share-
holders. The management is working at
full capacity in advances; though liquid
assets are now larger than at any other
balancing date, they represent slightly less
than 39 p.c. of the public’s money held, but
that is only a point weaker than the stan-
dard proportion. The size of funds com-
pared with liabilities fully compensates for
whatever small weakness there is in the
liquid position. Liabilities not backed by
liquid assets amounted to £3,208,284, which
was protected by advances with a book value
of £4,420,940, and premises written down to
£151,150. Therefore, 6s. in the £ of these
book values could be lost before any creditor
ne'ed become uneasy.

The shrinkage of profits for the past year
is of no consequence. Exes, were up all-
round ; they took £24,170 compared with
£20,770 for 1922, and meanwhile income ex-
panded only £l6OB. Heavier tax-payments
and staff increases accounted for most of the
extra outgo ; meanwhile income was affected
by the Permanent’s method of collecting its
corpus commissions on trust estates. This
charge of 21 p.c. is usually levied on the
estates by trustee managements when busi-
ness is put into their care, and some cos. place
these earnings in a special reserve which is
tapped from time to time as the instalments
are considered to have been earned. In
this way, so far as shareholders are con-
cerned, disclosed profits depend each year on
the extent to which the reserve is drawn
upon. The Permanent, however, makes the
charge when the estate is being wound-up
and distributed, and the profits for any year,
tUerefore, are to some extent contingent on
the number of trusts terminated. The co.
stresses this “concession” as a “special and
most important feature” of its operations: it
points out that whereas a £20,000 estate
would be reduced to £19,500 by extracting
the 21 p.c. corpus charge at the outset, on a
5 p.c. interest-earning basis the £5OO left
in tlie estate would in 20 years earn the
whole of that charge and tlie full amount of
the estate would remain intact. During
the past 12 months fewer trusts matured,
and earnings did not benefit to the usual
extent from corpus collections ; on the other
hand, better investment earnings made up
most of the shrinkage in the other section.
The business continues to develop nicely;
during the year the book value of trusts
expanded £472,512. That took the total to
slightly more than £8,000,000, and almost
double tlie figures of only eight years ago.
The co. is now in its 36th year; half-way in
its career it controlled slightly more than 21
millions. Earnings and outgo for a number
of years are shown in the next compari-

Since the transfer of £50,000 of reserves
in 1919 the div. rate has been 6 p.c., equal
to 11 p.c. on cash put in by shareholders.
For 1922, which had benefited by a large
amount of corpus commissions, the directors
sweetened the div. with a bonus of 3 p.c.,
but for the past 12 months, though profits
could easily have given the same bonus, only
14- p.c. was paid. It is unusual for a trustee
co. to vary its div. rates in this way, and
it is probable that when the previous distri-
bution was made Permanent directors con-
sidered that the extra 3 p.c. would be a regu-
lar thing. Evidently they have considered
it advisable to build up reserves again ; the
£llO,OOO of paid capital is visibly supported
by only £14,324 of reserves, though on pre-
sent values of city property the co.’s free-
hold premises, constructed just prior to the
war, are worth very much more than their
written-down book value (£64,300). The fol-
lowing table shows how funds have been

The directors are preparing for a new issue
of shares, and as they recommend the divi-
sion of the 175,000 now unissued into 100,000
ordinaries, 50,000 0 p.c. cum. prefs. and
25,000 71 cum. prefs., evidently the appeal
for new capital is to be accompanied by
bonus pickings. The only new capital raised
during the course of the introductory table
has been £87,500 called in on 175,000 of 71
p.c. prefs. which were issued as bonus shares
paid to 10s. in 1919. The co.’s interests have
expanded rapidly: in 1913 the balance-sheet
total was £609,374; in 1918, £650,278 ; and
in July last, £1,072,447. Besides the
£87.500 put in by shareholders a couple
of years ago, surplus profits have given
£111,209, the latter not including £60,000
received in scrip for the goodwill
of the Bon Marche offshoot. These
additional funds have not been nearly suffi-
cient to finance the expansion, and conse-
quently outside liabilities, apart from mort-
gages (which are £lO,OOO smaller than 10
years ago) have grown in this way: 1913,
£107,910; 1918, £99,612; 1923, £320.211.
The management has lately had the use of
11s. 3d. of outside money for every £1 of
the co.’s own funds. The greatest expansion
has been in respect of book debts: —
1915.. £192,802 | 1918.. £243,404 | 1921.. £337,176
1916.. 209,093 ] 1919.. 305,566 | 1922.. 383,105
1917.. 222,406 | 1920.. 304,734 | 1923.. 398,302
The co. does a big time-payment business
which produces handsome profits. Turnover
generally is growing steadily, the volume of
sales for the past two years having been
larger notwithstanding lower prices.

Against the £320,211 of floating debt were
stocks, “shown at cost or replacement value,
whichever was the lower,” book debts and
cash assets for £669,725. The holding of
shares in other cos. increased £28,414 on
the year, the Melbourne branch having been
floated into a separate concern in which the
parent holds practically all the ordinaries.
The Bon Marche is giving handsome returns:
the div. rate is only 7£ p.c.. but assuming
that all this parent co.’s dividend was earned
by the capital issued for tangible assets, then
Marcus Clark’s has been receiving 18f p.c.
p.a., and has also had its interests fortified by
an accumulation of surplus profits. The
parent itself socked away a visible £8269
last year after paying pref. divs. and 10 p.c.
on ordinaries.

This co.’s divs. went up instead of down
during the slump period. Profits receded
from the flood-tide mark of the boom, but
by good luck or good management—probably
both —the co. has escaped trouble since
values crashed. The co. did so handsomely
last year that when the accounts were ruled
off in July and pref. divs. and £5OOO for a
staff pension fund had been extracted,
£62,818 was available for ordinaries, repre-
senting a return of moi*e than 24 p.c., not-
withstanding that one-fourvh of present ordi-
naries were issued as bonus scrip in 1920.
The introductory table gives results since
Buckley and Nunn. Ltd., became an Aus-
tralian co. and raised locally £150.000 in
7 p.c. cum. prefs. to replace the English de-
bentures on which it had worked when head-
quarters were in London. In live years no
less than £155,601 of surplus profits have
accumulated, or only £35,220 short of total
cash-paid ordinary capital. At the 1918 bal-
ance £6142 of capital was still represented
by goodwill; and. though £63.613 of reserves
were converted into scrip, there are now tan-
gible assets with a book value £85,846 larger
than ordinary paid capital of £254,433. The
surpluses have all come from trading. There
has been no writing up of assets; premises
and all other belongings are shown in the
published accounts at original cost.

The only new capital raised during the five
years has been £BOB2 in ordinaries and
£18,375 of pref. contributions in excess of old
deb. funds. The large accumulations of
profit, however, have not fully financed the
expansion of the business, and in July last
liabilities were £lOO,OOO-odd heavier than
in 1918. Stocks were abnormally large at
the latest balance, deliveries having been
expedited for the current season. The total
£252,798 of liabilities was made up as fol-
lows : Deposits, £86,231: mortgages, £49,650;
sundry creditors, £32,847. Excepting matur-
ing deposits, the sundry creditors were the
only floating debts, and they were covered on
the other side by £82,751 of cash balances.
The co.'s position was, therefore, very com-
fortable. Additional funds may, however,
be required soon; the directors propose to
add four storeys to the rear portion of pre-
mises. After final divs. had been paid each
of the 150,000 £1 7 p.c. prefs. was secured
by tangible assets with a book value of

Geo. P. Harris, Scarfe and Co. took over an
old business in 1900 and developed steadily
until at the height of the war-boom 12 p.e.
was paid on three-quarters of a million of
capital. The directors decided to recon-
struct, and the issue of bonus scrip—I',
million ordinaries of 15s. fully-paid were put
out in place of a million of £1 paid to 15s.
—was derived wholly from the writing-up
of freeholds and leaseholds, machinery and
plant, etc. Stocks, book debts and invest-
ments were transferred to the new co. at
1920 book values. Portion of the inner
reserves so disclosed, and the whole of the
visible reserves previously accumulated, re-
mained intact, and the new co. started with
a reserve fund of £117,974. A lot of new
capital was raised in the reconstruction, and
there is now £1,283,213 on which divs. bave
to be paid compared with £950,000 three
years ago. The new co. began well by pay-
ing 10 p.c. divs. on its inflated capital; then
the slump in the hardware trade set in and
divs. have fallen two points per year. When
values were at their top stocks exceeded
three-quarters of a million, and considering
the swift downward run of prices and the
depressed local market tlie co. did well to
escape so lightly. Stock values continued
to decline during the past 12 months, and
competition among sellers to quit stocks re-
sulted in only slender profit margins. The
directors report that latest valuations were
on a conservative basis, and they believe
that prices have reached bedrock.
The feature of the latest accounts is the
increase of liabilities from £231,386 to
£479,343 on the year. This was brought
about by a fresh expansion of stocks and
book debts., alterations to premises, and the
purchase of San do vers, Ltd., of Perth, and of
Holden and Frost, Ltd., an old-established
saddlery and harness business. Changes in the
grouped balance-sheet figures are shown by

offered £150,000 of 7 p.c. bonds at par, re-
payable March 31, 1931. So great is the
public s faith in the old concern that appli-
cations for no less than £698,000 worth were
lodged. The directors give an interesting
reason why they did not issue permanent
capital: “During the next few years we have
coming in from the Westralian amalgama
tion, we hope, practically sufficient to take
the place of this bond money. Anyhow, the
£150,000 lent to the co. for 71 years will
make its position much easier, lhe co. has
apparently been depending a good deal on
“fixed n.nd other deposits besides the bank,
and though at headquarters there were stocks
and book debts for £1,311,150 to cover
£479,343 of liabilities, large funds which may
be withdrawn at short notice are liable to
cause inconvenience even m a big, healthy
business like Harris, Scarfe, Ltd. The
£200,000 of pref. capital carries 6 p.c. cumu-
lative nowadays, instead of 5 p,c. prior to
the reconstruction.

“Gazeeka” : When will mining cos. adopt
positive methods of reporting values of ore?
It has become a habit with developing mines
to report that “the drive shows gold,” or
that “fair ore” has been located, or “good
values” are showing. There are every-day
mathematical methods by which any known
value can be expressed; and newspapers
which publish mining news can help the in-
dustry to attain a better average of respect-
ability by refusing to publish reports con-
taining terms which mean nothing. A man-
ager must know the approximate contents
of his ores, and if the newspapers pay him
the compliment of publishing his report they
should insist on straightforward informa-
tion.

David Lumsden’s forecast gives Mt. Lyell
£151,000 profit for 1922-23, which is £28,600
more than for the previous year. Actual
results are even better, because £50,712 has
been allowed for depreciation, against
£33,715 last year. Lyell distributed a Is.
div. in June, and a similar amount goes to
shareholders next month.

“Old Timer”: James Hebbard, manager
of the Sulphide Corporation’s Central mine,
resumes control of the Broken Hill Junc-
tion after a break of just over 30 years.
It was the first big show he managed ; and
he has always had ideas as to how its low-
grade ore should be handled. The big block
of broken ground, the legacy of the old creep,
is certain to receive attention; for years it
has been only scratched because of weak
finance. By grabbing the Junction, Hebbard
puts the kybosh on the North’s scheme to
absorb everything in sight at that end: bur-
ley had been scattered by the British-Aus-
tralian Co. before the North programme was
unfolded, but the Adelaide Junction Board
wanted too much. Most Broken Hill people
seem to believe that the purchase price of
£75,000 represents only a fraction of the
value of the ore in the mine. Ore won from
the Junction has been valued at £1,148,700,
and divs. have run to £87,500. This is the
worst record of any of the claims that have
broken ore on the line-of-lode. But no other
co. has had so hard a battle to carry on. In
pre-sulphide days Jolly was the man at the
Junction helm; he lives in memory on
account of his skill in coding mining reports
to Melbourne. M'ost codes revealed their
secrets to telegraph operators before a week
was over, but Jolly’s “family” messages beat
the best of them. It was Joel Phillips who
paid most of the dividends. But he was in
too much of a hurry; and there followed a
creep which flattened out prospects for years
and years.

New Guinea Copper starts its smelting
campaign with £46,000 owing to the bank, so
the directors are out with a further issue of
50,000 £1 shares. This issue follows the
shuffle of June, 1922, when capital was in-
creased from £350,000 to £500.000, with a
re-classification of capital into 250,000 ords.
and 250,000 prefs. Half of the latter were
issued in the reconstruction, the ords. going
to holders in the previous floats. The new
prefs. are being mothered by the Baillieus,
but underwriting terms have not been dis-
closed. New Guinea prefs. are cumulative
as to 10 p.c. divs., and come in equally with
ordinaries for any surplus profits over and
above 10 p.c. all round.

Arrangements are almost finalised for the
taking over of the Lucknow mines (N.S.W.)
by a Victorian group, which proposes to re-
gister a new Melbourne-financed co. to be
knowm as the Lucknow Amalgamated. Luck-
now' Mines holders are to get share for share
in the new co., and Melbourne Stock Ex-
change will be the pivot of the commission
business instead of Pitt-street as hitherto.

Lack of a quorum prevented Y-Water
Tin, Emmaville (N.S.W.), from being
wound up last week. The lack of enthusiasm
is easily accounted for; the co. owes £14,135,
and the machinery residues are not likely to
fetch anything like that much.

Kalgoorlie has bucked up lately as a re-
sult of developments at the south end of
the field and in the Celebration mine, Hamp-
ton Plains. The new finds are declared to
be encouraging, but it is doubtful if either
will prove to be a big thing. During the
PTampton boom the “south end” was pegged
for miles, and many of the leases taken up
were declared to have reefs and lodes which
previous owners had unaccountably omitted
to test. Subsequent opening-up proved the
locality to be uniformly worthless, and it is
now dotted with the pegs of abandoned
leases and rusting plant. It is possible that
exploration will expose sections of good ore
in the Celebration, but that mine shows no
definite signs of becoming permanently profit-
able.
* * * *
Meekatliarra field (W.A.) has been
cheered by the announcement that work on
an extensive scale is about to be resumed
in the old Fenian mine. After yielding about
a million pounds’ worth of gold, the lode
dipped into the adjoining Ingliston Consols
property. Dr. McLaren inspected the work-
ings and considered that the wandering ore-
body would return to Fenian in deeper ground.
But the owners had lost heart and sold out
to the Consols Syndicate, who handed the
mine over to tributors. Developments at
depth appear to be proving the accuracy of
McLaren’s forecast.
Pilbarra Copper Fields, Ltd., alias Whim
Well Co. (W.A.), recently engaged Minerals
Separation, Ltd., to treat its ore. A Perkins
experimental plant is being installed, and if
results are satisfactory a much larger one
will be erected. Meanwhile shareholders are
being buoyed up with promises of handsome
returns when treatment is increased to 6000
tons of 6 p.c. ore per month as a regular
tlling - *
Westralian Mines Department has de-
cided to vote financial assistance to the
almost down-and-out Westonia field. To
start with, £lOOO has been set aside as a
dole to working prospectors, but if sufficient
inducements offer this grant may be doubled
or trebled. Over 20 claims, other than the
now derelict Edna May group, are said to
offer encouraging prospects. To date about
a million sterling has been won from the
little field.

Mararoa manager J. V. Mathers likes pros-
pects on the Emu leases at Reidy’s, near Cue
(W.A.). His check sampling confirmed ear-
lier results, and he recommended that a
working option be accepted to permit further
exploration. Sufficient ore is declared to
have been proved “to cover all expenditure,
including purchase,” if treatment is under-
taken on the spot. The Emu lode offers
“backs of great extent,” but Mathers is de-
pending on the green-schist lode in the bot-
tom levels for the better things. In a report
to the Mararoa Board he classifies the Emu
as “quite the best proposition seen in all
my recent inspections.”
Sons of Gwalia began life afresh
the other day when Westralian Premier Mit-
chell set the new mill running. The resus-
citation recalls old memories. Welsh miners
discovered and worked it, and later G. W.
Hall, of Swansea, managed it until the Lon-
don and Western Australian Exploration Co.
bought a controlling interest and gave 11. C.
Hoover the job. Hall liked to blow about
the mine. Hoover had little to say about it,
and not much about anything else. No one who
came in contact with the silent, youthful-
looking manager dreamt that in a very few
years he would become one of the biggest
men in the mining world, a candidate for
the Presidency of the U.S.A. and a Cabinet
Minister in that country. W. J. Loring.
whom Hoover imported from ’Frisco, also
managed the Gwalia, and afterwards pur-
chased Hoover’s partnership interest in
Bewick, Moreing and Co. Loring lives a
luxurious life in ’Frisco nowadays, and is
said to have an eye on the Governorship of
California.

Prospectors who joined Jones’s State-aided
expedition which last year located high sur-
face-values beyond Laverton (W.A.), made
a good deal. A co. was floated in 1100
shares of £lO each, and the 10 pros-
pectors divided 1000 fully-paids issued
as vendors’ consideration. Most of them sold
out at prices ranging from £5 to £2O per
share. The co. has expended all its working
capital, and is now planning to get more.
The greatest depth attained so far is 25ft.,
and five veins giving values from sdwt. to
several oz. have been disclosed. The average
width of the veins is only 15in. Neverthe-
less, on the whole, results so far appear to
justify the expenditure of another thousand
or two in further prospecting.
* * * *
The Lloyd George (W.A.) battery appears
to have got well ahead of the mine: the 927
tons treated during October was less than
half the capacitv of the 10-head mill, and
the yield of 2ssoz. panned out at under
7dwt. The tension was relieved a little by
the recovery of £663 from sands and slimes ;
but the full result was barely payable. Divs.
still seem to be as far off as the rainbow.
Daisy Queen (W.A.) recently got into
financial difficulties and tried to sell our.
Several prospective buyers were sounded,
but no business resulted, and the co. is now
appealing to the Government for financial
aid. The Daisy, although a small show, is
g°°d.
McLeod’s Reward, Marble Bar (W.A.),
has commenced crushing, and is said to have
a chance. This show was pegged, worked
and floated by a partially-disabled returned
soldier in the early part of this year, and
the shares are mostly held in Adelaide. Its
average value so far is reckoned to be 20z.,
but if crusliings average only half that
shareholders will have nothing to complain of.
Westralian Mines Minister Scaddan finally
agreed to grant a co. an option, subject to
certain conditions, for five years on all leases
which have been without owners for two
years and more.
* * * *
Both Ingliston and Ingliston South,
Meekatharra (W.A.), have been thrown
open to tributors. Both cos. were floated in
Melbourne, the former in 1920 and the South
a year later. Neither has so far developed
or crushed up to expectations, and the
advent of tributors is regarded by pessi-
mists as the beginning of the end.
The closing of Clark’s mine, Charters
Towers (N.Q.), is not definitely settled yet:
another appeal has been made to the Mines
Department for funds to carry out further
driving and sinking. The subsidy that started
the mine on its dividend-winning career was
repaid promptly, and that may make the
Ministerial ear more sympathetic, lor the
time being the mine is being kept in good
order to permit a resumption if funds are
forthcoming.
Prospecting at Brookfield, near Brisbane,
is turning out fairly well. The Eclipse is
on good pyritic-vein material, but assays are
not running quite so high. A small crush-
ing and amalgamating plant is being built,
so the public should soon see results, lon-
nages will be small, but there are bound to
be some liigh-value crusliings, particularly if
the pyrites-vein is not diluted much.
The discovery of the Mt. Isa field has given
an impetus to prospecting in North Queens-
land. The Nightflower lias helped, too, and
a fair number of southerners have passed
through Townsville to try their luck. Traflic
from Cloncurry to Mt. Isa was assuming
lively proportions, but reports that water had
given out slowed things down.
Silverspur (Q.) carries on quietly, select-
ing the rich stuff for Port Pirie. Latterly
Edgar Hall has been hauling some of the best
ore that has ever come out of the mine; lie
expects the last shipment to go something
like 15oz. gold and lOOoz. silver. The Port
Pirie parcels are small, but what sweeteners
they would be for the medium- and low-
grade ore if treated locally! Hall still has
the optimism that can laugh at difficulties
such as the lack of railway communication.
Arsenic production is moving along rapidly
in the Stanthorpe district (Q.) : September
quarter figures were 391 tons oxide in addi-
tion to a few hundred tons from the- Bee-
croft, treated at the Wallangarra works. The
Jibbenbali State mine is reckoned to be pay-
ing with a reduction in costs to about £3O
per ton. Its output for the quarter ran to
£14,000. The present workings, however, are
looking pretty poor, but there are considered
to be reserves on other lodes in the same
area. The Sandown mine is on very rich
ore. and is doing well. Its output for the
quarter was 135 tons oxide worth £5400.
#
The Mount Coolon lode (Q.) is reported to
have thickened out to 20-25 ft. in the bottom
workings. Values can be decided only by
crusliings. There is so much ore in sight
that five extra heads of stamps are to be
added to the co.’s battery. Although there
are three batteries on the field, those out-
side the charmed circle complain bitterly that
they cannot get a look in for their ore. Bar-
ring Mount Morgan, Coolon field can be
looked to to supply the largest gold yields in
the northern State.
* * * *
Derek’s, at Stannary Hills (Q.), should
soon be producing again, and its returns
should make the Hills one of the chief tin-
producing centres for Herberton. New plant
and battery are on the ground, and low-
grade ore reserves are satisfactory at pre-
sent tin prices.
* * *
Allora coal-mine, Darling Downs (Q.), is
now producing on a small scale, and plans
are in hand to push the trade. The coal is
of good quality, but rather fiery in combus-
tion. Tanny morel is its only local competi-
tor. and Tanny has a tight grip on the rail-
way contracts, small though they are at pre-
sent. # # *
The Hercules, Bendigo, last week won
380 oz. from 214 tons taken from the stopes
at the 1380 ft. level north; and from the
scuth drive off the winze at the 1520 ft. level
15 tons were treated for 650 z. With pay-
able stone also going north, this winze at
the moment is the most hopeful proposition
in Bendigo.
New Loch Fyne, Matlock (Vic.), working
at No. 1 level towards the western wall, ran
into spurry country, and now has a sft.
floor showing. This is in the big diorite
basin out of which Tricks’s old co. scraped
up over £lOO,OOO in divs. Deeper work so
far has failed to disclose much pay stone,
but on the new floor on the right strike
luck may change.
* * * *
The Big Ben lode, Zeehan (Tas.), is de-
veloping well. An underlay shaft gave 30
tons of rich ore down to 25ft. and in 14ft.
of driving 30 tons more were won. One
lot bulked 118.50 z. silver per ton and 68 p.c.
lead; seconds assayed 640 z. silver, and 45
p.c. lead. About 160 ft. north of the under-
lay shaft the formation shows lOin. of solid
ore.

“Blanc” : The 13tli captured two prisoners
fit Hebuterne during the exciting days of
March, 1918. when spy scares were as com-
mon as shells. The captives gave the'pass-
word, but could not speak another word of
English. Therefore, as they were dressed as
"Tommies,” WO were certain they were
spies, but decided, as we were near platoon
headquarters, not to shoot them until our
•’loot” had seen them. The officer con-
firmed our diagnosis of the pair, but, think-
ing he’d receive more kudos for handing
them over to higher authority than by re-
porting their deaths, he detailed two of us
as escort. There was a good deal of grumb-
ling over the job as the captives were
hustled off, with no particular gentleness,
to battalion headquarters. There they were
quickly identified as two Welshmen fresh
from somewhere back of Merthyr Tydvil,
who had lost themselves while on patrol from
their unit half a mile away from us. I’ve
TO SEE OR NOT TO SEE.
THE MERE MAN: “You cut me yesterday, Tess —I saw you twice.”
THE DEAR WOMAN: “I never notice people in that condition.”
wondered since vliat wight have happened—
to them and to us—if we had been more
precipitate or our “loot” less calculating.

“Akran” : Speaking of queer liidey-holes
for accumulated wealth reminds me of the
time in 1918 when the Diggers were very
busy in stopping the Hun offensive towards
Amiens. Most of the Frenehies in the
towns we occupied had left their homes hur-
riedly, but they soon returned when they
learned we were there. In one house that
had been evacuated at a few minutes’ notice,
Skeeter, our company cook, was plying his
craft when an old dame complacently walked
into her rightful kitchen, remarked "Bon
jour, M’sieur,” moved over to the fireplace
where Skeeter was tasting the stew, thrust
her hand up the chimney, and from a hole
inside drew out a large handful of notes—
about a couple of thousand francs’ worth.
“Bon, eh, M’sieur,” smiled Madam. “Struth,
was all Skeeter could gasp—“right under me
blanky nose, too!” The company wondered
that day why the stew was delayed; a depu-
tation "that went to interview the babbler
found him black as the ace of spades. He
had crawled up every chimney in the village.
“Blanc”: We could always pick out tin'
Tasmanians in the A.I.F. At the order,
“Two paces step back—march !” they would
always look cautiously over their shoulders
to see if there was sufficient ground available.
* * * *
“Delver”: Another bit of old Sydney to
pass into the hands of the knacker is the
hoary pile at the corner of King and Eliza-
beth'streets, formerly known as Henderson s
Buildings, and dating from ’4B. The site
is set out in many of the old records as the
first place of execution, although a case can
also be made out for the opposite side of
Elizabeth-street. But whether or not the
spot is where the first gallows stood, it is cer-
tain that the corner was part of a market
garden which extended from Castlereagh-
street up the rise as far as what is now
known as Queen’s-square. This patch was
part of a grant of land made to a man who
was reprieved while the hangman’s knot was
still dangling about his neck. The swing was
shifted to the Barley Mow site a few months
later.

accorded to a candidate in the polling-booths.
In the 1920 elections for the Legislative
Council three candidates contested a country
division, a planter and' two lawyers. The
ballot-boxes had been sent to Suva for the
count, and the three would-be members were
at the local post-office to get the result by
’phone. It arrived as follows: Caneking,
134; Sixeneight, 76: Billocosts, 1. “My
Cod, my own vote!” groaned the stricken
lawyer.

“Pnom Penh’s” gorge rises : —•
A. U. Alcock’s remarkable process of thawing-
frozen meat by electricity was mentioned (B.
l/11/’23), with a remark appended that Alcoek had
taken another invention to London years ago only to
find lie had been forestalled by a foreigner. This
stirred some cells of memory a quarter-century old.
Alcoek invented an electric range-finder, a small
thing attached to a telescope, which could be con
cealed in a belltopper. The wonderful instrument
gave nearly accurately the rang-e in yards and the
bearing in degrees and minutes of a moving ship
to an observer on land. The irreducible minimum
of error was 70 yards in 10,000. By ordinary
wires this range-finder could be connected with a
dial in a gunpit, and as the vessel moved so did
the hands of the dial, giving the exact position of
the ship. The observer could touch a button and
let off one gun or 10 at the right moment. And
there was no need, as with the only range-finder
then used, the Watkins, to have the guns placed
on a known base. That is to say, one gun might
be 100 yards from the observer, another three miles,
a third a mile away. Therefore each big gun ;n
a fortress could be fired singly or a broadside might
be hurled from a dozen of them, because they were
all under the control of the observer who held the
range-finder. One would have thought the War Office
would have tested such an auxiliary to its fort
artillery without delay. Actually, I spent six
months haunting the old War Office in Pall Mall
trying to persuade the chief of ordnance to send
an expert to inspect the model we had erected in
Queen Victoria-street, Westminster, about a mile
TOO TOO TALKATIVE.
“Her only fault is that she tells all she knows to a lot she doesn't know.”
“Oh, no; worse than that. She tells a lot she doesn't know to all she knows.”
away. No fear! That silly old general wouldn’t
listen to me. When I got tired of sitting on til
War Office front door-steps, a depth bomb was re-
leased in the shape of a letter of introduction given
me in Melbourne by a sister-in-law of Lord Roberts,
then commander-in-chief in Ireland. The sleepy
old War Office dodderer who got Lord Roberts’s
letter sprang to attention, touched a bell, ordered
an artillery expert and a hansom, and the model
was inspected and approved that same day! That
week it went to Shoeburyness, was fixed up and
tried successfully, amidst suppressed excitement and
large quantities of mystery, and Alcoek and I slapped
each other on the back and promised our wives
valuable jewellery, antique furniture, furs and a
very quick trip home. But from that day to this
we have heard nothing of the range-finder, although
it is a treasured possession of both the War Office
and the Admiralty. Stolen ! Pooh —a fico for the
I’h rase! “Annexed” the wise call it. Somebody
got the money, the fame and the title; somebody
is a great genius, and two little Australians dropped
their bundle, and lost, incidentally, one of the elec-
trical wonders of this century. Shortly afterwards
the United Steel Co. at Bethlehem (U.S.A.) told me
it could have got a million dollars for the con-
trivance'from the United States Government.

“Sierra”: Some of the sea-superstitions
mentioned by “Caveman’ (B. l/Ll/’23) seem
to have been invented, or at least greatly
amplified, by writing-men. Old seamen used
to say that a shark’s tail nailed on the jib-
boom-end made a ship lie closer to the wind ;
perhaps the real reason for the ornament
was to distinguish the deep-water ship from
the mere coaster. I never saw a sheath-
knife stuck in the mast to bring a fair wind ;
but one of the seamen from the Trevessa,
interviewed by a London paper, mentioned
that it was done during the voyage in an
open boat to Mauritius. Casting propitia-
tory offerings of old clothes and sea-boots to
the sea used to be a common practice, but
it was generally indulged in towards the end
of a voyage. Off Cape Horn I have seen men
who would have given a month’s pay for a fair
wind, but they were not superstitious enough
to chance any of their scanty dunnage with
a long passage before them. How the lands-
man’s superstition regarding spilled salt came
to be hitched to the mariner I don’t know;
1 never saw salt at sea. Friday is con-
sidered an unlucky day both afloat and
ashore. What seamen were more concerned
about was the superstition, carefully fostered
by some shipowners, that Sunday was a
lucky sailing-day. It was soon allowed
to be forgotten when payment for Over-
time came in. From personal experience
I should say that the three most widely-
spread beliefs of seamen; are that whistling
brings wind, that Finns have some mysteri-
ous power over the elements, and that bad
weather follows the killing of albatrosses. I
hold to the last, one myself. As to the
whistling, our ship was becalmed off Pala-
wan, and the Old Man strode up and down
the poop whistling furiously. A few hundred
yards away, on a motionless junk,
the Chinese skipper was seen ceremoniously
casting tiny objects over the side. Our
mate, who had sailed for years on the China
coast, explained that the heathen was roll-
ing spirals of scented rice-paper and launch-
ing them on the sea to retch wind. The
Old Man digested the information. “Slant-
eyed loonies!” was his contemptuous com-
ment. Then he suddenly remembered the
plight of our own ship, and resumed lus
whistling.

“Rice”: The decision of the Chief Justice
of Tasmania, referred to by “Wealsman ’ (B.
l/11/’23). which deprived a Tassy girl of
the legacy coming to her from her deceased
brother’s estate because her husband was
one of the witnesses of her brother’s signa-
ture to the will, was good law; ’S’onah
could have given no other. But it looks as
if “Wealsman’s” law were at fault when he
tells ns that the other sister “won the case
and takes everything.” Where a gift is made
to the husband or wife of one of the wit-
nesses to a will, that gift not only lapses,
but, in the absence of any provision to the
contrary, forms the subject matter of an
intestacy. That is to say, the testator is
held to have died without making a will, so
far as that particular gift is concerned.
Applying this rule to the case quoted, it is
clear that the sister who was deprived of
her share as a beneficiary under the will can
hardly avoid receiving something as one of
the deceased’s next of kin under the intes-
tacy.

Prate to me not of the birds that sing,
Never mention the blooming rose;
As bees to blossom, my fancies wing
To feast on daintief fare than those
In fields where the fortunate delver sows
Notes and silver, and gathers crops
Of hats and dresses and gloves and hose—
The summer fashions are in the shops!
Plodding Nature —the poor old thing—
Deep in the rut of convention goes;
In the self-same garb that it wore last. Spring
Again this season each flower blows.
Can’t you imagine the lilac’s woes? —-
“Purple again!” as each small bud pops—
But for happy mortals who change their clo’es
The summer fashions are in the shops !
To those glass gardens where ribbons fling
Rainbow tendrils across the snows
Of voiles and laces, the seasons bring,
Each in its turn, the rarest shows.
On the carpet sward see the buds unclose
Their cardboard lids as the paper drops;
And some wonder of satin and tissue glows—
The summer fashions are in the shops!

Far more deadly than malt and hops;
List to the gazers’ Ahs and Ohs—
The summer fashions are in the shops!

APDATH TOBACCO CO., LTD., LONDON.
“Tabak”: Tlie natives of Sek Island, in
the Madang district (Papua), becoming-
bored with waiting for a sick man to die,
buried him with a stick in his hand and told
him, if he still did not feel like dying-
after he had been there for a while, to shake
the stick and they’d dig him up! He shook
—and they kept their promise. But they’ve
never forgiven him for not speaking since
his exhumation, though that happened 10
years ago, and he is still among them.
“L.E.8.” on a large problem
“L’Fou” and “Hamer,” who have been ailing their
view that locality has an effect on the birth-rate,
know nothing about it. Let a lady speak. For a
few months I was keeping a, small shop (the suburban
small shop, if there is a woman in it, is the women’s
parliament), and I learnt more then from young- mar-
ried women about the curtailment of the birth-rate
than I had in all my previous-44 years',. “Wrinkles”
such devices were called, each one giving her own
particular recipe. To one young woman, who made
no secret of what she did and who had to be taken
away to a Women’s hospital for an operation, 1
talked like a mother, pointing out to her that she
had a husband in a good job, who neither gambled
nor drank (that was the commonest excuse among
the other “wrinklers”) and four pretty children,
and that she would put herself in her grave if she
wasn’t careful. It so happened that her husband
was sent away to the country back o’ Bourke, and
she went with him. A year ago she came to see me.
In the intervening seven years she had borne four
more children, and for all that she looked littie
older than her own eldest girl. Environment? I
shouldn’t call it that. Children will come, if then-
parents let them, in city or country.
And “Old Timer” from the same standpoint:
“Hamer” draws the deduction a man naturally
would from the birth-rate being higher in the
country than the city. But the cause goes deeper
than mere domicile. City women have fewer children
than their country sisters because in the city it is
much easier to procure means to avoid having them ;
and should accidents happen there are scores of
“nurses” to “fix them up” for a tenner. If science
were turned to lessening the pain of child-bearing,
there would be a hope of larger families. Although
few men swear by the Bible nowadays, there is one
part they all believe —a passage to the effect that
woman forgets the pain in the joy of motherhood.
She doesn’t, and childless nurses might just as well
leave off telling the husband that his wife has had a
splendid time. Is is pretence of this sort that
helps to influence a woman against a large family.

has been raised for public purposes seems to
be habitual in Sydney. Fourteen years ago

was collected, and then apparently the fund
and its object were forgotten —until the City
Council set about desecrating the historic
spot with a public convenience. An objec-
tion was lodged, and the Council- promptly
abandoned the scheme; but if the memorial
cross is to be raised, at least another ioUo
will be needed in view of the increase in the
cost of labor and materials since 1909.
“Flicker”: A new beer has lately been
introduced into several Adelaide bars, and
the local cognoscenti are taking notice of it.
My friend James, who can tell the brand of
most beers merely by hearing the bottle
opened, was discussing it recently. He ruled
that it was “dam’ fine beer, but
“Ninepence!” said James tragically— abso-
lute extortion for a small glass of beer.
“But you get the ordinary glass, said a
friend.' “It’s ninepence for an ordinary glass,
not a small one.” James regarded him with
dignity. “All beer glasses are small, he
said severely. The controversy ended there
and then.
“Muljarra”: When the recent spasm of
mob misrule in Swanston-street (Melb.) had
surged along the western shop-fronts between
Little Collins-street and Bourke-street, and
left a fringe of devastated . and looted win-
dows in its wake, the soft night air suddenly
became lyrical with quaint, elfin music. It
came from the tramp of hundreds of teet
through shattered plate-glass lying inches
deep on the footpath. Over the sullen roar
of the shop-wrecking mob it sounded like a
tinkling fairy symphony.
“Harry ,T." : The only German saw-edged
bayonets I came across in France were those
that were pointed with six inches of smooth
metal. And a man whose body has accom-
modated six inches of bayonet steel rarely
worries whether the next six inches or the
next six feet, for that matter—are .smooth
or jagged.
“F.A.” : One night, when our artillery offi-
cers’ mess was settling down to grub, a_ sooty
Gyppo kid walked into the big tent without
being observed by the mess orderlies. rle
had a bundle of newspapers under his arm,
and when he reached what lie apparently
thought was a vantage point lie yelled
“Egyptian Timees —All about blanky blank
old Colonel ; blanky, blank old blank.
The boy’s face was absolutely expressionless
while he was bawling out the newly-acquired
English that he had been advised to use to
secure quick sales. It was an army boot
that cut short his recitative, to the accom-
paniment of hilarity from all the mess except-
ing the Old Man. #
“Machete”: Bowen, in North Queensland,
is a place where nothing much ever happens
except on steamer day, unless it is a fight in
the main street between two William goats.
But it has just put up something original m
the suicide line. The central figure m the
tragedy, being of a frugal mind, first removed
his clothes. He did this in the railway yard,
without apparently attracting any attention
from the casual Queensland railway em-
ployees ; then, climbing on to an engine, he
opened the door of the firebox and dived into
the flaming furnace. The fireman made a
desperate grab at a pair of disappearing feet,
but missed, and the determined gentleman
had made a good job of it before they raked
his cinders out with the others, let some
people will tell you that residence in the
tropics saps the initiative and will-power ot
the white man.
“Kowsara” : With £2OO in his pocket and
a touch of home-sickness in his heart, lip
Fat, a Chinese cook, employed for the last
two years at a Win ton hotel, forwarded Ins
photo with an application for a passport to
the Customs at Townsville. There the pic-
ture was recognised as that of a steward
who nine years ago had deserted from the
Strathairlv at Melbourne. Three days after
arrival in'Townsville Yip was consequently
arrested as a prohibited immigrant and sen-
tenced to imprisonment until arrangements
for his deportation to China could be made.
Still, his luck wasn’t altogether out. Be-
tween the time of his arrival and arrest In-
had lost the whole £2OO at the fan-tan tables
so that he couldn’t have paid his fare back
to the Flowery Land. But toi las a < -
he would just have had to look round foi
a job; as it is, he gets a tree passage home.
“Singemoine”: A sentence of six months’
hard passed by a N. S. Wales Judge on a
bottle-wielder last week was the Bench s fust
recognition of a tendency which is becoming
a public menace. The law provides exem-
plary penalties for such crimes as forgery
and embezzlement because they are usually
made possible by the existence ot an atmo-
sphere of trust. The same principle should
be applied to the beer-bottle thug. The pos-
session of a sandbag is pretty conclusive evi-
dence in itself of criminal intent, but the
most reputable of citizens are m the liabjt
of carrying bottles about. Unless this harm-
-I,,necessary practice is to develop into a
shame and a reproach, and liable to get a
man laid out at sight on safety first
grounds, the underworld will have to be
made to realise that this century regards
bottling as the last did garrotting.
“Anaf” : Some time ago a girl in Queens-
land was thrown from a motor, and received
very shocking facial injuries. The two local
meds., one of them a woman, got busy, and
by removing flesh from other ot
the patient’s body succeeded in building up
the damaged tissues. The nose, which had
been practically torn away at its base, was
replaced with a porcelain bridge, while a
new set of teeth restored the lips to then-
normal contour. To-day the only signs of
the mutilations are a few not very noticeable
scars, and the girl is about to be married to
a man whom she has met since the accident
occurred. And neither of the doctors is a
specialist in surgery ; they are ordinary gen-
eral practitioners.
“Chant Pagan”: “The Deacon” (B.
11/10/’23) is quite right in thinking that
there ought to have been some Maoris bap-
tised before 1523, but his own paragraph
gives the reason why there weren t. lhe

STIRLING, Presi-

Council in S. Aus.,
who, as chairman
of the Wallaroo
and Moonta Co.,
has just
announced that
that old copper -
producer can con-
tinue no longer.
John Bice, who went out to pneumonia
ir; Adelaide last week at 70, was a politician
of the old school, big, burly and bearded.
Born in Cornwall 70 years ago, he came to
S.A. as a child and settled at the Mecca of
Cornishmen, Moonta, as a blacksmith. Later
he was trader and Mayor at Port Augusta.
Then he was sent into Parliament by a
northern district, and his strong common-
sense and rugged honesty made him a valu-
able asset to any Ministry. From 1908 to
1915 lie was in and out of Cabinets, and from
July, 1917, was in the Ministry continu-
ously, dying in harness. Chief Secretary
was his usual billet, but he had tackled irri-
gation, industry, public works and (long
ago) the Northern Territory. His Cabinet
service totalled about 11 years, which is
longer than the record of any other South
Australian except Richard Butler.
“The Deacon" : As dinkum a little padre
as ever buttoned collar behind passed out
when Michael Gannon went west the other
day. His fame as a rattling forward and deadly
tackier of St. Stanislaus’ (Bathurst) still
lives in scholastic sport. When the seculars
handed over control of the western college
to the Vincentian Fathers, in 1890, it was
to Gannon fell the task of re-oi-ganising it
educationally and sportingly. Born in Ire-
land, he got his final polish from the
Spaniards in the Irish college in Salamanca,
and soon after joined up with the mission-
ary order of St. Vincent. His first 15 years
were spent as a classical professor; a spell of
missionary work in Vic. and N.S.W. fol-
lowed, and finally he became head serang of
the order at Ashfield (N.S.W.). Failing
health and deafness forced him out of the
job. and Paul Cullen, the Cardinal’s nephew
and cousin of Cardinal Moran, succeeded
him. Gannon was 64 when the Black Camel
called.

and some of his

Dr ARGYLE,
who as Chief Sec-
retary is the
Ministerial head of
the Victorian
police.
The latest turn of the wheel in the Speck
has made a change in the relations of two
Ministers. Joe Lyons, the new Premier,
used to be a clerk in the office of Ogilvie,
the new Attorney-General—he was a teacher
before that. Incidentally, .Tim Belton, the
Minister for Lands, was noted when he held
office before as the only Minister of the
Crown in Australia who did not. wear a tie.
But then he has a fine ziff.
Gone to join her husband, who set out on
the last long trek a couple of months back,
Mrs. Ellen Molloy, widow of the discoverer
of Mt. Molloy (Q.). The pair were among
the pioneers who blazed a track through the
wilderness of the Cairns Hinterland in the
early ’seventies, and 40 years ago they settled
down to rear a family on the first holding
taken up on the Atherton Tableland.
Having been a rebel himself when he was
a student at Melbourne Trinity College 33
years ago, Dr. Argyle, the Chief Sec., may
have a trifle more sympathy with the police
on strike than he cares to express at the
moment. The students professed to have been
driven to their little outburst by the head of
the college, and Argyle and his fellow-rebels
made out such a case that the Anglican
authorities cancelled their expulsion.
“D.D.” : When Dowell O’Reilly was feeling
his political way in the early ’nineties, with
an eye on the Parramatta seat, he thought
some free lectures would help. Filled with en-
thusiasm and Carlyle, he announced a disser-
tation on the French Revolution. On the
evening fixed., as was customary in the old
town, the crier was sent round with his bell.
Coming into town Dowell was horrified to
hear the bellman crying: “Roll up! Roll
up to Victoria Theatre, and hear Dowell
O’Reilly on French Revelations!” They
rolled up, but not just the crowd the lecturer
had hoped for. The building was crammed.
Fifteen minutes after starting, the. “revela-
tions” not forthcoming, an exodus began, and
continued at intervals till the 500 was re-
duced to 50. The lecturer struggled on
bravely for an hour and a half, but his en-
thusiasm had cooled, and the other lectures
were abandoned. Mention of the French
Revolution afterwards brought forth the
nearest approach to a swear-word the gentle
Dowell ever used. His victory at the elec-
tion of 1894 was a sensation in the political
world. He defeated Hughie Taylor, who had
held the Parramatta seat for over 20 years,
having been returned on 10 occasions.
“Yacko”: The family-tree of the late Dr.
Holtze, formerly curator of the Adelaide
Botanic Gardens, is extraordinarily cosmo-
politan. His mother was French, his father
Hanoverian and a grandmother Spanish. He
married a Russian, and the only daughter of
the union added Welsh and Scotch to the
list, while a grand-daughter brought in Irish
and Danish. The great-grandchildren are
Bolsheviks—l know, because I’m their
mother.
James Gray, chairman of directors of
Gray Brothers’ steel mills at Newport
(Vic.), who went west the other day, was
one of the few remaining craftsmen who un-
derstood the art of iron “faggoting.” The
process has been rendered obsolete by the
introduction of mill-rolled steel, but the top-
notchers at it were once regarded as the
aristocracy of the industry. He first broke
into the buisness as a young man with his
brothers in Adelaide, but later transferred
to Williamstown (Vic.).
When the “red fool fury” was raging in
Melbourne on Derby night Dawson was at
Castlemaine : Allan, his offsider, was at Kya-
bram, the home of hobby-horses; Argyle,
Minister of Police, was convalescing from
’flu at Toorakia; and Purseminder McPhair-
son, who doesn’t often go away, was week-
ending at Healesville. The two K.C.M.G.’s,
Robinson and Peacock, and Bud Groves, the
Whip, were the Grand Command on the
Saturday. But they were reinforced by
other, .Cabineteers on the Sunday, when there
were three or four sittings.
Lieut.-Colonel Alderman, who passes to
Sydney from Hobart as Staff-Officer, Ist
Division, is the only officer of the Australian
Permanent Forces who went through the
Avar as a member of the N.Z.E.F. While
Brigade-Major at Launceston he was sent to
Maoriland as exchange officer, and was there
when the war broke out. His “exchange”
Avas Capt. Burgess, of the Enzed Staff Corps,
Avho finished the war as Brig.-General, and
C.R.A. of the 4th Australian Division. Aider-
man succeeds Col. Percy MacFarlane in
Sydney.
The passing of A. O. Williams, of Wan-
ganui. made a notable rent in the ranks of
the sky-pilots of Maoriland. Born in the
Bay of Islands 67 years ago, he followed his
family in devoting himself to the natives—
grandfather was that Archdeacon Henry Wil-
liams who came to the Dominion in 1823
and was the first resident pakeha to be
ordained and to work among the Maoris;
and his father was .Judge Williams, of the
Native Land Court.
Sydney Sun, giving a send-off to Dowell
O’Reilly, concluded that he was the most
artistic of Australian short-story writers,
and it selected “Twilight” as the finest thing
he had done. The Buletin —for, which, of
course, “Twilight” Avas written—has always
placed that study in the very front rank,
but it isn’t lonely there. A story, wiiich the
late writer himself thought the best he had
produced, is “Innocence”; it has all the rare
qualities of “Twilight,” and is to appear in
the Christmas Bulletin on December 8.
H. E. Barff, who takes his leave after 42
years’ seiwice as Registrar of Sydney ’Var-
sity and some previous years in a tutorial
capacity, Avas born in Tahiti, the son of a
missionary, and got his early education at
Camden College. He had a large capacity
for silence in council, but when he did speak
he was listened to, and he would fight with
an almost feline ferocity for youngsters
whose abilities-had attracted him. Many
impecunious youths have Barff to thank for
grants and assistance Avhich came from un-
expected and often undisclosed quarters.
There died at Longreach (Q.) recently
Ivan Samuel March ale. who, while private
tutor and musician to the family of an Aus-
trian Count, eloped with the youngest daugh-
ter, aged barely 17. The runaways reared
a fine family of seven sons and one daughter.
The old Count offered to adopt all the sons,
but the parents declined, and eventually he
died leaving £2OO a year each for the edu-
cation of the children. These all received a
college training in Sydney, and did well,
and at intervals they went north to see
their parents, who lived on the proceeds of
a shop. The widow, still a beautiful woman,
has now gone to make her home with her
eldest son in Melbourne.
Frank Bond is only about half the mem-
ber of the Speck’s Leg.-Council that he was.
As the result of steady fasting (for a little
Avhile he had only one meal a week, but has
hoAV gone up to one a day) he brought his
weight down from 224 stone to 15. And his
health has shown a progressive improvement
with his figure.

think he was of the Polish variety. Then
there was Isaacs, sometime quartermaster of
the White Star Medic in the Maoriland
frozen-cargo trade. Isaacs was afterwards a
stevedore at Oamaru. The Penguin, wrecked
opposite Terrawhiti a few years back, carried
as chief steward one Jacobs, who had begun
his sea life by serving before the mast in
several lime-juicers. Another U.S.S. steward
of the Yiddish persuasion was Joe Levy, pre-
sent manager of the Carlton Hotel, Sydney,
who was for years in the Wellington-Picton-
Nelson run. There used to be a fair percent-
age of Jews amongst the craft on the Thames
some years ago, and there are plenty of the
persuasion in the Navy. Many Australians
will remember petty-officer Dan Hyams, of
H.M.S. Powerful, who put up one of the best
fights ever seen in a Sydney ring.
Commander Argent, recently dead in Adel-
aide at 67, was a Britisli seaman who helped
to bring the gunboat Protector to S.A. in
1884. He stuck to that ship, which for some
time was pretty nearly Australia’s only
navy, and served with it in the Boxer
trouble in China. For about 10 years he
was in Sydney as instructor to the Naval
Reserve of the Commonwealth, but the rest
of his service was in Adelaide.
Robert Stevenson Aitken, Maoriland-s
Rhodes Scholar for 1924, is the son of a
Gisborne parson. At the Otago ’Varsity,
which he entered in 1918, he graduated M. 8.,
Ch.B., and since then has been junior assist-
ant to the professor of anatomy, besides lec-
turing at Gisborne High School and Knox
College. He goes to Oxford to continue his
studies in physiology and psychology, and
he hopes to keep fit with tennis and hockey.
W. R. Deeble, the chief mechanical engi-
neer of the Speck’s railways, being now
two years in excess of the age limit, is tak-
ing a spell for keeps. He joined up with
the original company in 1878 after having
served his apprenticeship in the Phoenix
Works at Ballarat, and climbed steadily till
he became head of the loco, business.
After 40 years on blue water Captain A.
PI. Summers, of the White Star Ceramic, is
on his last voyage prior to handing over the
wheel for good. He served his apprentice-
ship on the old sailing vessels wdiicli traded
between Liverpool and Australia. During
the S’African disturbance and the Great War
he did his bit on various troopers, and in
’l6 he was in command of the liner Geordic
when she w'as captured by the raider Moewe,
a circumstance which led to two years in
German internment camps.
Major .T. Hamilton, D. 5.0.. who is head-
ing for England on the Osterley to talk
business with his engineering firm (Clayton,
Shuttlewortli and Co.), was originally with
the Intelligence Corps, and went to France
with the Motor Transport, which was
attached to the B.E.F. until the Anzacs
arrived. He is the son of Judge Hamilton,

sity in Engineering, and besides being a B.E.

CARRYING ON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
W hen war broke out and England called for men
to face the foe,
A man whose name was A illiam Smith was one of
those to go;
He learnt the art of sloping arms, he learnt the way
to shoot.
And proud as Lucifer himself was Smith the new
recruit.
Instructors licked him into shape before he crossed
the sea
1o fight—or so they told him —in the cause of
Liberty.
They tutored him and lectured him ; they trained the
man until
He almost reached perfection mark at every sort of
drill.
Then on the Other Side he joined disciples of the
Pack.
Who humped their gear from front to front by road
or duckboard track.
For it was everlasting tramp, with packs, by day
and night;
And men were always moving on to find a place to
fight.
He humped his pack down sunken roads through
miles of liquid mud;
He humped it up to Come-again, and back to Corne-
a-thud.
He tramped until his shoulders ached, and till his
feet were sore,
Among the men who called themselves the Human
Camel Corps.
He humped his pack by Delville Wood and down
through Bernifay;
He carried it to Albert, and he lumbered it to
Bray.
For war was largely humping packs; and thick on
every route,
The Aussie army moved along and sought the foe,
per boot.
He humped his pack from Zillebeke along to Boozer-
ville;
And oft-times in my fancy I can see him marching
still,
With pack, tin-hat and rifle, and the incidental gear
That a Digger had to carry through all his war
career.
He humped his pack through shell-swept fields in
hail and rain and snow,
And went on Shanks’s pony everywhere he had to go;
And sometimes very bitter were the thoughts that
crossed his mind
Re the officers’ valises in the limbers on behind.
But Peace is smiling on the land, and down a country
track
Smith humps his big Matilda, as in France he humped
a pack-
As honorary members of the Unemployment Corps,
The William Smiths in hundreds have to carry on
once more.

BOSS: “How are you gettiii’ on with the rabbits, Wurra?”

BOSS: “That’s good. So you got eight?"
WURRA: “No fear, boss! I bin miss that one plurry rabbit ebery

"P.F.P.” : Years ago an Ulmarra (N.S.W.)
racing enthusiast had a high-class mare with
a foal to the thoroughbred horse Warlike. The
youngster was at first regarded by the owner and
other competent judges as of great promise. Then
a draught mare running in the same paddock lost
her own foal by accident, and willy-nilly decided
to adopt the young thoroughbred. The constant harry-
ing of the bWod-mare by the would-be fosterr-
mother and her associates resulted in the former
going dry, and the foal was induced to suckle the
draught. As time passed, the youngster gradually
began to assume the appearance of a half-draught—
developed hairy legs, coarse mane and tail and rather
ungainly movements. Tts adult life was spent be-
tween the shafts of a dairyman’s springcart and
in ploughing operations. This incident is vouched
for by a renowned owner and breeder of thoroughbred
racing- stock living at present in South Grafton.
Perhaps there is some truth, after all, in the sugges-
tion that a child imbibes its mother’s nature through
the mammary gland ; and maybe this influence ac-
counts for the poor mentality of many of Britain’s
young aristocrats, who have been wet-nursed by
women of low intellect.
■‘Dan Sofo” (Nigeria) : If it isn’t too late
let me add my testimony to “Jim Dandy’s” (B.
19/4/’23), and tell “Azrim” that the spitting snake
is anything but a myth. I first ran across him in
East Africa, and have met him many times in the
bush here. The venom is ejected in the form of a
spray and, as “Jim Dandy” asserts, is aimed at the
optic. A miner who had received a dose from one of
these horrors told me that the resulting pain was
excruciating, and that for many years afterwards he
periodically felt the effect. In his case, though,
blindness did not result, and he attributed his good
luck to the fact that he immediately bathed the
eye with fresh milk —a remedy which I have since,
been told by natives is very effective.
“Myalla” : A lady at Petersham (Sydney)
recently, on noticing her pet bulldog lying very
sick in the yard, gave him an emetic, with the
result that in a short time he coughed up her gold
wristlet-watch, which he had swallowed during a
ramble through the house. She had informed the
police that the watch had been stolen, but was
able to report that it had been returned in good
condition and still ticking.
* * * *
“Jimmy Possum”: I’ve heard a lot about
these shooting-from-horseback stunts; but I’ve never
met anyone who could plant a rifle bullet any-
where near the mark from the back of a gallop-
ing horse. When ’roo shooting I. fired many a time
from the saddle, with the horse standing, and I
always found it most difficult to shoot straight with
no other movement to disturb the aim than the
breathing of the prad. I’ve met plenty of liars
who thought nothing of shooting a crow on the
wdng from the back of a galloping horse, but there
wasn’t one I couldn’t shoot rings round, and I
wouldn’t guarantee to hit a 3ft. tree once in 10
shots at 50 yards from the bank of a galloping
neddie. It is usually safe to call a man a liar
who talks of using a rifle from the back of a prad
in motion, unless, of course, he’s three times your
size and twice as young as you are. But even then
it’s safe enough, as awful liars are usually better
runners than stoushers.
“R. O. Chester”: A Vic. farmer, while
travelling some ewes from the railway to his farm,
with three red kelpies of which he was justly proud,
left the mob in a half-way paddock with the dogs
while he boiled the billy with a neighboring cocky.
Returning in half an hour, 90 of the sheep were
found worked into a corner between two right-angle
fences, and the three self-satisfied looking tykes
were squatting close up to the jamb. The owner
grinned at first, but looked less pleased when he dis-
covered that 76 of the sheep had been smothered,
14 on the outer edge being - the only survivors.
“S.E.M.” : Recent pars, about a horse tra-
velling - with broken legs recall an old-man ’roo I
shot a few' years ago.
He hopped off as
though I had missed,
and I sent the dogs
after him. ,He had
gone about 200yds.
when he toppled over,
but as I came up he
was standing on one
leg (balancing on his
tail) and putting up
a great fight. On
finishing him off I dis-
covered that he had
been shot through the
thick part of the leg,
the bone of which was
fractured. Another
time I had a similar
experience to that of
“Boundary Rider 32”
(B. 25/10/’23). I shot
a Too, but except that
she leaped about 4 ft.
straight up in the air
she hopped off quite
naturally. After going
about 100yds. full bat
she fell over dead. A
post-mortem showed
that I had shot her
right through the
heart. In each instance
a .32 Winchester was
used,
“Billy Brolga”: I don’t know anything
about that 2ft. Sin. Fraser Island death-adder men-
tioned by “Mag” (B. 11/10/’23) ; but if my memory
serves me there was a 37in. specimen killed on the
Mount Perry railway, near Bundaberg (Q.), a goodish
while back, which was reputed to have been the
largest death-adder ever scotched in the Common-
wealth. What happened to the corpse I don’t know;
but I have a notion it was piekled.
“Tarago” : Anyone could see that Dad had
engaged a new hand as they took their seats in the
train. Not a word was spoken between them dur-
ing the first hour of the journey. The Pommy had
his nose deep into the “best seller,” and Dad ap-
peared to be counting the telegraph posts through
the window. “Ah,” he exclaimed at last as if

it is you!"

satisfied with his tally', “we’ll soon be there now.
When we get ’ome we’ll milk an’ after that we’ll
separate; then you can go down th’ paddock with
th’ cows.” The choom contemplated him over the
top of the book for a few seconds. “Ah doan’t go
down no paddock wi’ no keows, mister,” he said,
in measured tones. “Ef th’ has no room at th’
hoose foor I, we’ll separ,aate at th’ station.”
* * * *
“Saaedi": Some Abo. recently wrote of a
cat that killed a fox. That seems a pretty good
performance; but I know of a better one. In this
case the victim was a dog. Certainly the cat was
a tiger cat, but then the dog was a bulldog. Pursued
by the dog the cat took refuge in a small yarran
tree, and for a while the parties were content to talk
threateningly to each other. Suddenly the cat sprang
at his enemy and fastening his teeth in the back
of the bulldog’s neck, effected a K.O. inside three
minutes. It is possible that a stickler for Queens-
berry rules might insist that the verdict should
have gone to Bully on the grounds of a foul, but
it is doubtful if a dead dog would have anjy use
for such vain glory.
* * * *
“T.F.K.G.” : Tell “Dupont” (B. 11/IQ/’2S)
that Lieut. Wilfred Robinson missed sometimes, or,
anyway, once. I was talking to an ex-Bth L. Horse-
man the other day, and asked him if he knew Robin-
son and if he could shoot. “My oath!” he replied;
“he could shoot all right. But he missed once.
It was going over that it happened. One of the
boys chucked a kerosene-tin overboard, and several
officers were trying to sink it before it got out
of range. Robbie ran up, pulled his pistol and
was putting his left arm up for a rest, when he
pulled the trigger and the bullet went through his
arm. It wasn’t serious; but hh didn’t look to see
if he hit the tin.”
“Booral”: The other day, while my hus-
band w'as cleaning up on the oyster banks at
Booral (Q-), he caught among the rubbish what
was something new to us in the way .of fish. It
is about Sin. long and 2in. deep, with a rough,
woolly skin, apparently without scales, and it has
four legs. Two of these, very short, are under the
stomach directly in line with the gills, and the
other two (twice the length of the others) are near
the front fins. When first noticed, this queer fish
was running on its pedal equipment. My husband
handed it to the local School of Arts; but —what
is it?
“McJ.”: On the Coen (N.Q.) there is an
old mare, owned by Harry Lauder, that has a real
feminine penchant for changing her coat. Her
natural color is bay, but nowadays she is sometimes
bay, sometimes grey and sometimes between the
two—roan. She has often changed from bay to grey
and back to bay—and seems to be proud of it.
“Ross” : “Boun-
dary Rider 32’s” ’roc
that travelled 317yds.
with a heart burst by
a bullet from a .32
Winchester (B.
25/10/’23) reminds me.
One evening I shot a
hopper near Tiboo-
burra (N.S.W.) and it
dropped like a stone.
It was apparently as
dead as a doornail
when I cut it open;
but its heart continued
to beat powerfully, and
no amount of amateur
surgery in the way of
amputation of the in-
testinal organs seemed
to damp its determi-
nation to defy the laws
of nature. At the end
of a good 20 minutes
of butchery it was still
going strong, and
finally it continued to
give convulsive kicks
after I had perforated
it in many places with
a knife. A reputable
citizen witnessed the
weird affair and can
vouch for my veracity.
Medical men reading
this will be feminded
of the post-mortem
beating of the frog’s
heart in their student
days; but the froggy's
organ will stop func-
tioning if sufficiently
ill-treated, whereas,
apparently, that of the
kangaroo in certain cir-
cumstances can, like
the brook, go on for
ever. I might add that
as soon as I saw how
things were after open-
ing up the animal, I
killed him again seve-
ral times with maty
bullets in the brain.
He was most certaimy
as dead as I could
make him with a gun.
* *
“Delver” : Re the Murray River and its
scaly namesake. “Nor’-West” (B. l/11/’23) mistakes
the front name of the man whom Sturt honored.
Sir George Murray, who was Secretary for the
Colonies during the Darling administration, is the
man —not Sir Charles Murray. The real discoverer of
the river was Hamilton Hume. Sturt did not drop
across the stream until five years later, when he
shot into its waters from the Murrumbidgee.
The river was first navigated by steam in ’53, the
pilot being W. R. Randall in the Mary Anne, though
Sturt did it just 20 years earlier by hand and
wind. Albury was reached by the steamer Albany,
navigated by Cadell, who followed Randall up the
river a few weeks after the latter had stirred up the
mud for the first time. That the cod is indigenous
to Australia is beyond doubt, as the earliest records
of the country the other side of the Blue Mountains
testify'. When the first settlers arrived on the river,
Binghi directed the attention of some of them to the
fish as being “budgeree.”
WRONG SIZES.
UNCLE BOB: “Hulloa, Tom! Have any luck?"
T OM: "No, uncle. There weren't any fish to
fit the hook.”
“Geo. Rich" : Apropos the white wallaby
mentioned by “Adamascus” (B. 11/10/’23). Two
years ago, at a South Groperland Show, a white
opossum (a coomal) was exhibited. If I remember
rightly, the pink-nosed mass of snowy fur ulti-
mately found a home in the Perth Zoo.

VAGABOND CAMP,
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
In ragged tents or huts, as when
The gipsies find abodes,
We’ve fixed our camp, a welcome den
For wandering women, vagrom men,
And children of the roads.
The Broken River gleams, where we
Along the banks are curled.
Outcasts and wastrels though we be,
We fleet the moments carelessly
As in the golden world.
From all the corners of the land,
Within this magic ring,
We’ve drawn our jolly rascals’ band,
Who’ve done wifh work, they understand,
And done with wandering.
All goods we hold in common here.
What matter right or wrong,
Or whether life be cheap or dear,
If we can broach a keg of beer
And have our dance and song!
Old Sal may go to work one day,
Or Red Mick hunt for skins;
Sometimes we need a little pay
We’ll gather in to fling away
In free and easy sins.
But we’ve no cares. No black smoke curls
Among the big gum-trees;
Nor life of labor round us whirls,
We’ve shelter, food and dogs and girls,
Sunshine and hearts at ease.
On summer nights we’ll drop a line
Into the quiet stream.
The water gurgles; and it’s fine
To see the stars and fishes shine
As queer as in a dream.
We watch worn horses strain and champ
Beneath their heavy load;
And struggling settlers pass our camp,
Or strings of dusty swaggies tramp
Along Benalla-road.
For us the river bends; the sun
Shines in the bright, blue sky.
The life of man is quickly done;
But we can laugh and take our fun,
And let the world roll by.
VICTORIA.

The “WARRNAMBOOL’
The World’s Greatest Handicap Road Race over
the Melbourne-Warrnambool Course was decided
on October 27th and attracted 196 starters including
the greatest riders of Australia and New Zealand.
The event was won by P. Wells (41 mins.) in 8 hrs.
37 mins. 5 secs., with P. Osborn (16 mins.) 2nd, and
C Bell (N.Z.) off 18 mins. 3rd. Fastest time for the
3rd successive “ Warrnambool ” was won by the
Australasian Road Champion, P. O’Shea of N.Z. off
scratch, he riding the 165 miles in the fast time of
7 hrs. 51 mins. 41 secs. The scratch men were
timed over the first hundred miles of the route and
J. Beasley (Vic.) rode the “century” in the world’s
competition record time of 4 hrs. 37 mins. 57 secs.
AMATEUR “100”
Concurrently with the “Warrnambool” an Amateur
Race was held over the last 100 miles of the course
—137 started and the event was a great success.
The winner was N. McLeod (6 min.) in 4 hrs 55 mins.
22 secs, whilst S.Ramsden (Vic.) established fastest
time from scratch, riding the “100” in 4 hrs.
52 mins. 42 secs. —amateur competition record.
The two events demonstrated the popularity of
DUNLOP
TYRES
the first 18 men (including Ist, 2nd and 3rd
fastest times) to finish in the 165 miles race riding
these speeoy and dependable tyres, whilst the
honors were also carried off by “ Dunlops ” in the

a
"Myalla" : “Helen’s" grafted linger (B.
25/10/’23) reminds me of a lad of 13 I knew, who
lived out Ashford (N.S.W.) way, miles from a
doctor. While-playing he jumped on a broken piece
of glass and cut his toes badly, the 'fourth on the
right foot being severed and left hanging by a mere
thread of skin. His mother in her alarm bound the
toe tightly into place in its blood ; and the member
grew. The patient reached manhood long ago, and
that toe has flourished so well that it measures fully
half an inch longer than any of the others.
“Warrawee”: “Skyrider” (B. 13/9/’23)
states that the black mamba of Africa reaches 20
NOTHING MEAN ABOUT HIM.
TRAMP: “Can I doss ’ere fer-night, mister? "
FARMER: “Over in the chaff-house you may."
TRAMP: “But I’m that ’unary I might start eating the chaff."
FARMER: “Oh, a hit of chaff won’t matter.”
feet. I have shot black mambas, likewise brown,
in Rhodesia during a stay of many years, but never
killed or even heard of one over 7ft., and that
length was generally doubted. A full-sized mamba
rarely reaches 6ft. Certainly they are quick and
deadly. From bite to last gasp is about 10 minutes.
A dog of mine went out in less. Mambas, like all
other snakes, will get out of your way if they can,
but, in common with their, brethren elsewhere, will
strike when disturbed suddenly.
STAKED HIS CLAIM.
“You must hare laid a goodly number to rest in your time, my brother. Are you prepared
for the time when your own turn shall come?”
“Too right, I am. There’s ’alf a block back there waiting for me and the old 'woman.”
“Splinter”: I always thought until re-
cently that the tough hickory would grow in any
old place, but evidently this is not so. On Jerra-
bombera Hill (Queanbeyan, N.S.W.) a species
grows that, despite repeated attempts, will not live
for the Forestry people at Canberra, about five
miles away. It has been coaxed in all sorts' of ways,
but inevitably turns up its toes. I understand that
the Jerrabombera Hill and somewhere near Tumut
are the only spots where this particular herb hangs
out.
“T.L.S.”: Rc “F.M.” oh Binglii and can-
nibalism (B.
18/10/’23). I lived for
about 25 years in the
midst of tribes in Yorit
Peninsula (Q-), and
I don’t think canni-
balism was very com-
mon with them. I
can vouch for only one
instance that came to
my personal know-
ledge, About 26 years
ago some blacks, in
spite of our warnings,
set fire to the grass
and nearly wiped out
our hobbled horses,, so
we made for Brother
Binghi’s camp, and
frightened seven years'
growth out of about
four-score of thorn.
When we crept up
they were sitting round
their little camp-fire*
and feasting on some-
thing with great gusto.
I took particular notice
of one young lubra at
a fire nearest me. She
was picking some
bones which in the
dim light looked like
those of a bird, but
when ,we stampeded
the mob we discovered
that the delicate mor-
sel the black lady had
been picking so grace-
fully was a nice! v
roasted human hand.
We subsequently
learned that the tribe?
was feasting on a de-
parted friend who had
died a natural death.
The old abos. have great faith in
tl>e omnipotence of the police. I was acting as
retureing-officer in the Pilliga Scrub (N.S.W.) at'
a Federal Election about 1917, when the first to
come along- to vote were a blackfellow and a half-
caste woman. They were armed with obsolete
Electors’ Rights. I pointed out that as the woman’s
name was not on the roll she couldn't vote. “But
she's got her Right,’’ argued the nig. “Can’t vote
all the same,” said I. “All right,” rumbled .Tacky
truculently, “I’ll see the plurry sargint about it
to-morrow!” A few weeks previously the same nig's
lubra was sick. Some of the other gins from the
camp, without his permission, got medicine from
Wee Waa and gave her a couple of doses. That
night she was much worse. Jaeky 5 opined she was
poisoned and demanded to see the medicine. The
gins had the “wind up” and said they had burnt
it. “Berry well,” raged .Tacky, “I’ll take her into
the plurry sargint and have her opened in the
morning.”
“Jesmond”: Still another entry for the
Queer Accident Stakes. In Melbourne recently the
child of a young married couple was having a rest-
less night. The mother, who had a weak heart,
sat up to give it some soothing-syrup, and while
she was fumbling with the bottle \ the cork got
pushed in. Her husband told her' to shove it right
in. When she did so, the bottle burst with a bang,
and the woman fell back —dead.

Winnie Antill’s testimony:—
I can corroborate what “Lobjc” (B. 20/9/’23)
says about breeding pearls. In my own family Col.
Forster (who raised the Shekawattee Battalion)
owned breeding pearls, which were lost in the Mutiny
(1857). I have often heard my people talk of
them, and rice was given them in the same way ss
“Lobjc” describes.
"Dungog”: Tell "Golub” (B. 18/10/’23)
that I once tried the hypodermic injection of potas-
sium permanganate solution, and the result was
completely successful. The patient had been bitten
by a sft. brown snake, exactly over the patella; a
ligature was immediately applied and the wound
freely incised with a broken blade of a jack-knife,:
whose two immediately previous occupations had
been (1) cutting tobacco and (2) removing a stone
from a horse’s foot. The wound when I saw it
was dirty, swollen, inflamed and very painful; the
patient was in a state of collapse, and quite sober
in spite of the fact that a bottle of whisky had been
poured down his teetotal neck in an hour and a
half. I injected 80 minims of a 1 p.c. solution
into and around the wounds; the raw surface was.
swabbed with the same solution and then dressed
dry with iodine. Injections of strychnine were
given, the ligature was loosened, the pain dis-
appeared altogether in six hours, and healing occur-
red without any sig-n of sepsis.
“S.W.K.”: Re “Ivobbi’s” query as to the
northern limits of the English starling (B.
18/10/’23). I can show him a flock of about 300
here, 700 miles west from the Darling Downs, or 65
miles south-east of Cunnamulla (Q.). I first noticed
them about four years ago. The flock then consisted
of about a dozen birds and was forthwith reduced by
three, which I shot to verify my supposition that
they were real English starlings. Incidentally, I’d
like to know if any of the Council has ever seen a
hawk tackle these birds? They seem to have agreed
to ignore one another.
“Pounamu” (M.L.) : I was specially in-
terested iti “Paroo Peter’s” roohenster (B. 4/10/’23)
because, after I li d collected two eggs from the nest
in our fowl-run one morning lately (we possess only-
two hens and one rooster), I saw Egbert, a large
bird of dubious ancestry and sanctimonious looks,
take his place in the box. After sitting there with
a smug expression for half an hour he left the nest,
and we gathered in the third egg for that morning.
It looks as though the earthquake in the Pacific
has upset more things than were at first apparent.
“X2X"; “Billy Nudgel’s” idea that de-
creased breeding among rabbits in a dry season is
due to contagious abortion (B. 25/10/’23) is prob-
ably more correct than previous explanations. But
the contagion is not brought about by poor feeding,
as he suggests. The cause is more likely to be the
presence of a grass-fungus which flourishes only
when there has been little rain. It is known that
a growth of this kind, similar to the ergot-fungus
of rye, is found on ordinary grass under dry con-
ditions, and it has even produced epidemic abortion
among cattle and sheep.
"Pat Bushie”: I claim to have 1 found the
champion pie-eater. I met him in Newcastle, and
after the pictures he suggested a pie and tea. We
went into a shop. “Warm up all you have,” lie
told the girl. She looked startled and said there
were 17. “Doesn’t matter,” he replied. “Warm
’em up.” 'the two girls ate one each, l had two, and
he polished off the rest.
Afore about wild-feller yarraman
"K.A.”: “Assac” is right in supposing (B.
18/10/ 23) that brumbies are not indigenous to Aus-
tralia, hut he is wrong in connecting them with die
horses lost by Governor Phillip. The first importa-
tions consisted of one stallion, three mares and
three colts. The mares were sent to Parramatta,
whence two were stolen by convicts, who perished in
the hush. What became of the mares is not known,
but it is hardly likely that these were the first
horses to cross the Blue Mountains, which were not
negotiated by man for over 20 years after; the mares
were stolen. It was on the Murrumbidgee and Lachlan
that wild horses were first seen. 1 was told as a
youngster by old Bill Lake that the' brumbies origi-
nated from stock which got away from the settlers
of the Bathurst Plains. Bill and his brother George,
who died only a few years back, were employed on
Cowl Cowl and Burrabogie, in the western Riverina,
to shoot clean-skins (horses) on those two runs,
being paid ss. a head for them. These two pioneers
of Laing’s Crossing, as Hay was called in the ’fifties,
did not shoot down all the brumbies they came
across. They built wing fences half a mile long,
with a stockyard at one end, and yarded the mobs
they sighted on the plains. They then picked out
tin- best and shot the remainder. The pick were
driven down to the Murray-side and sold. Some of these
wing-fences still exist on Gunbar and Illilliwar sta-
tions, which are parts of the two runs first men-
tioned. It was while they were returning from a
horse-selling trip that the Lakes stuck up the
coach near Deniliquiti. . They did not do much
damage, and were soon back on the plains. George
Lake is still spoken of by the oldest hands of the
Hay district as the greatest roughrider ever seen ;
TRADING ON HIS NAME.
“Gibbit couple pound terbdcca, Missa Ross,
an' stickem down to cleboss."
“What's pour boss's name, Larrie?"
"Nebber mine 'bout dot. Mine Unlit you
soon fine out unite when he yets de bill."
he had been known, when . riding- after brumbies
along the wing fence, to vault front his saddle on to
the back of a brumby-: and sit it to a standstill. The
last time I saw him he was a blind old" tean who was
being ' driven round . the. shearing-sheds of the-Hay
district, accompanied by a small boy and a 'phono-
graph. There is a theory that the brumby sprang
from the survivors front wrecks, off the Vie..' coast,
and that they made their.' way north to the Murray,
where they split into two lots, one veering off towards
-Monaro and the other taking. the easy country on
the other side of the river. In .’76 the ship City of
Melbourne, carrying about £20,000 worth of ‘blood
horses, was wrecked after leaving Melbourne for Syd-
ney, and many tales were current at the time that
some of the valuable stock had made the shore and
had “joined the wild scrub-horses”; but no conclu-
sive evidence was ever produced on that score.
“Yoyang”; In May, 1788, the livestock in ihe
colony comprised 1 stallion, 3 mares, 3 colts, 2 bulis,
5 cow's, 29 sheep, 19 goats, 49 hogs, 25 pigs, 5 rab-
bits, 18. turkeys, 29 geese, 35 ducks, 142 fowls, 87
chickens. But in June the two bulls- and four
out of the five cows wandered off into the bush
through the carelessness of a convict. The descend-
ants of these were afterwards found at the Cow-
pastures, near Camden. I cannot recall the escape
of the stallion and the three mares, though without
doubt some of their descendants “went bush.” The
brumby was certainly not indigenous, . for it is
recorded that the natives were afraid of a man on
horseback, and when they saw a rider get off his
horse and walk about their hair nearly stood on end.
HILL SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a range that seems to call us to its sum-
mits through the haze,
Ever magic in the morning when, the verdure is
ablaze;
And we know that we shall reach it on a day of
linging rhyme,
Though of all the hills the fairest is the hill we
never climb.
In the summer-time it calls us
When the blinding heat appals us,
But we hope to wake its solitude in time.
When the clover burr has fallen and the grass has
shed its seed,
When the grain is reaped and garnered and the
fallow’s bare of weed
There is ample time to ponder, as we slack the
bridle rein
.And behold the distant summit we are certain to
attain.
Ev’ry day the prize grows dearer,
Though 'twill never seem the nearer
Till we mount the timbered slopes beyond the
plain.
In the early autumn weather when the summer
crop is mown
And the tender shoots are peeping in the paddocks
newly sown
We may feel a trifle weary; but our season’s task
will end,
So perhaps we’ll go a-roaming and that distant peak
ascend.
W'o may reach it if we travel
And those mysteries unravel
Round the summit : which the magic mists at'tend.
But the clouded sky is weeping and the grass grows
rank and tall
While the mountain peak is huddled in a mist-
encircled shawl;
Tired and aching then we loiter, somewhat sad and
past the prime,
We forget the distant ranges that we once resolved
to climb.
bet them guard their hidden treasure,
For we’ve quaffed of dreams full measure
In the magic hours that keep ihe march of time.

Kiss the flower ami turn the hour,
And greet your love again,
sang Kipling in the days when civilisation
had not dreamed what a poppy would so soon
symbolise. But the War came, and for five
years it drained the nations of their young-
manhood. Then one day the guns ceased
their devilry, and the vulture air-craft
dropped five doves. The blessed Armistice had
come! Fitting that this should be the day
on which we finger with our dead, and try
to bring a little more brightness into the
fives of our maimed living. So the Poppy
Day Collection has come to be the hallelujah
of the practical sympathiser with the war-
scarred soldier. From early morning last
Friday the street fair was in swing. On
every ferry pier and at every tram stop the
vivid red flower bloomed. Martin-place
looked like a street scene in Nice. Gay stalls,
garlanded and streamered, lured the stray
shillings from flic bottom of the peggy-bag;
chocolate-wheels chortled merrily; collec-
tion-boxes grew heavy as the hours passed.
Sydney was remembering.
Jewry gathered its beauty and its chivalry
for the opening of tin; War Memorial, or
Maccabean Hall, at I larlingliurst, at the
eleventh hour on Sunday, which was Armis-
tice Day. General Monasli performed the
ceremony, and every Jewish community in
Australia was represented. Besides the
great Digger chief —dressed in civilian
clothes in token of his return to plain citizen
fife —there were present Justice Isaacs, of
the High Court, and Rabbi Brodic, the bril-
liant scholar who was recently acquired by one
of the Melbourne synagogues; Judge Cohen,
who is president of the hall committee;
Moritz Gotthelf and George Judah Cohen,
representing honorable age and affluence;
and all the leading Jewish citizens and
clergy. The Governor of Queensland, Sir
Matthew Nathan, sent a telegram. Mixed
with the Chosen were prominent non-Jewish
citizens, including General Ryrie, M.H.R..
General Brand and Sydney’s Mayor. And
all Jewry had brought its wife.
The entire building was packed; hut the
speeches were radioed to all the smaller
rooms. The sudden hushing of the clatter
for the reverential two minutes’ silence was
an impressive feature of the ceremony ; imme-
diately afterwards the big General pressed the
electric button which unveiled sundry in-
scriptions, and declared the ball open. It
was a momentous day for Jewry, which now
boasts that it has for its social activities the
finest dance-floor in Sydney in all but size,
and a building with every modern idea for
use as a literary and social institute. It
cost £25,000, and some of the money Ims
still to he found. The chief notables
assembled again in the evening for a ban-
quet and more mutual congratulations; and
on Monday night the dance-floor was chris-
tened by a hall held by the Jewish Literary and
Debating Society, which had bespoken the
date months before. It drew as representa-
tive a gathering and as big a crush as the
opening ceremony.
To the ultra-orthodox even a tram-ride
during the Sabbath is an offence; but
General Monash chanced all that by arriving
from Melbourne on Saturday morning. He
was rushed with engagements. He was
entertained by the University Club on Satur-
day, had lunch with the R.S.L. on Monday,
and in the evening was dined at Parliament
House before rushing to the Town Hall to
receive an address. This being his first
visit to Sydney since his return from the
war, the city was anxious to say to him
some of those things which he missed hear-
ing when he declined to take the triumphal
procession through the Commonwealth that
he was urged to take on his return.
Saturday was a day of great expectations
for the patients of the Ryde Home for In-
curables, for they wore firmly convinced that
the takings of their carnival fair would out-
weigh those of any previous year. Acting-
Governor Cullen speeded the fete with
kindly speech, and his lady stood by in soft
grey smiling above a marvellous bouquet of
blue and pale-pink flowers picked from the
Home gardens. On the lawn before the front
doorstep gay little tables and chairs called
you to sit and drink a syrup or an ice-cream
soda; flags and balloons floated in the breeze;
and from their balconies sick men and women
in their wheeled chairs looked down, their
main forgotten in the afternoon’s excitement.
In the porch Mrs. Smith presided over her
stall, with a rosy-faced small girl beside her
to help in handing over the sample bottles
of perfume and cakes of soap which for 10
years have formed Mrs. Smith’s stock-in-trade.
A thousand junior Red Crossers took to
the footlights on Monday afternoon in aid
of their own funds for helping soldiers’
orphans, and sometimes a lonely maimed
soldier himself. Time was when the good
little girl was content to "sit under a tree
and sew as long as her eyes could see.”
But the modern good little miss is more
enterprising. She powders her knee-caps
where the dimples will bloom later on,
wriggles into the attire of a dryad or a
butterfly, and presents herself to admiring
friends as a Pageant. Of course there are
Deborahs still, and these, trim in starched
frocks and proud caps, peddled ices and
sweets to parched galleries and stalls.
Armidale, the sleek city of the Northern
Tablelands, made merry over her diamond
jubilee last month. She celebrated the event
(her Mayor being Morgan Stephen, a Welsh-
man) by an eistedfodd whereon grew a crop
of prizes rich and varied. The musical com-
petitions drew singers and musicians not only
from the outlying districts, but from other
cities. Not the least glittersome facet of
the jubilee diamond is an attractive souvenir.
Well printed on good paper, it tolls the story
of Armidale from the moment explorer
Oxley noted it in his path to Port Macquarie.
Now it burgeons with churches and schools.
It has a proud fist of Digger heroes, and of
sisters and mothers who helped at home. It
has gardens and fountains and pleasant
sports grounds; and judging by the number
of photographs reproduced in the souvenir, a
photographer who may yet rival Henry Ford
for millions.
A dramatic touch was given to the big
choral competition at the festival. Young-
Dr. Verbrugghen arrived with his Guyra
Musical Society late in the afternoon, and
had a rushed final rehearsal; then just as the
folk were assembling in the Town Hall there
came an urgent call for the doctor to return
to Guyra, about 80 miles away. The Armi-
dale Society sang, and the evening wore on
towards midnight, but the medico-conductor
did not re-appear. Armidalc’s Mayor made
a long speech of sorts with the sporty inten-
tion of “holding on” in the hope of the
Guyra man turning up; but finally it had
to be announced that the Guyra choir would
sing under the baton of the Armidale con-
ductor. Just then there came a hammering
at the closed doors of the hall, which were
opened to admit the breathless, travel-
stained doctor. He crushed his way through
the packed house to the stage, on which stood
his choir, and the crowd cheered wildly.
There was an echo of D’Artagnan's great ride
about the whole affair ; but the flaw in the
drama was that Guyra choir was beaten by
five points.

bird from the Garcia aviary, is holding a

Sydney visitors to Melbourne’s Cup are
declaring the whole thing a washout. Weather
so dreadful that no clothes that were clothes
could be sported ; and practically no evening
festivities, owing to the police strike. No
men, for one thing—everybody had enlisted
as a special constable. Even the newly-
engaged Gordon Brady and his brother-in-
law Ernest Watt—though it doesn’t matter
for him. his wife being still away in Eng-
land. The food ordered by the G.-G.’s, the
local Governor’s lady, and civic dignitaries
all went to swell the mess of the loyal
“specials.”
The Uni. is to have a War Memorial. But
whether a glad peal of bells, or a swimming-
bath that would make the Old Roman Empire
shimmy-shake with envy, hasn’t been decided.
There is a side-issue, too, of a special lec-
tureship. At a monster meeting of Women
Graduates during last week. Prof. Holme
flung his logic into the scales on the side of
the carillon; but the students still hanker
for the waterhole, though that will cost

Constance D’Arcy, Farmer's welfare-super-
intendent Miss Hinder, Women’s College
Miss Williams, and Prof. Muscio’s lady
breezed in and out of the argument, but no-
body managed to produce the nail-on-tlie-liead
last-word. Probably filthy lucre will say it.
Time was when to be a poetess meant to
be a blue stocking, and a blue stocking was
a lady with shocking taste in hats. But
Dorothea Mackellar, shown in this Leighton
picture, not
on ly writes
the best brand
of Australian
poetry, but
wears some of
the prettiest
hats in Syd-
ney : only a
Iyr i c poem
could do justice
to them. The
clever little
lady has just
brought out a
•new book of
he r work,
which takes its
title, “Dream
Harbor,” from
the first color-
ful set of
verses. Color
is the strong
point of her
work; but there’s fun in it, too, and a wistful
note that trembles on the verge of poig-
nancy. Dorothea’s proud father is knight
Charles, who specialises in child welfare and
finance.
Lady Eorbes Robertson said good-bye to
Sydney on Friday night. After the inevit-
able speech, in which she promised to he
back next July, and after the very last cur-
tain had dropped on her as Bluebeard’s
Eighth Wife, she arrayed herself in georgette
warmed up to magenta tints, and held a re-
ception on the Criterion stage. The welcom-
ing handshake was given in the foreground,
while the boar’s head or its locum beckoned
to the feast from a long table in the back-
ground. The platters and bottles were no
unwelcome sight to the guests, who had been
huddled about in the stalls during the b,alf-
hour necessary for the lady’s change of
attire and the spreading of a moth-eaten
cloth over the boards. Dick Stewart acted
as Chief Master of Ceremonies, and the
Eorbes-Robertson chick, Jean, was busy in a
milked-coffee frock of tulle, twisted about her
hips with a glittering sash that suggested
a nicely-coiled python.
Later on, when tire dweller in the Plains
had gone and only the Olympians were left,
they took a ’busman’s holiday, and enter-
tained one another with song and dance
from their various shows. The hostess, for
her part, crooned some of her famed coon
lullabies.
There was a great roll-up of the National
Council of Women at the Women’s Club one
day last week, when the buttered bun of
farewell was passed to a group of leaders of
women’s movements. Included were Dr. Grace
Boelke, Jean Hinder, Mary Jay, Gladys
Marks and Mrs. and Miss Harper. The last
two are leaving for England with Professor
Harper early next year; meanwhile they are
going to Melbourne, probably to become
acclimatised to Cold Country vagaries. All
the others air their most alluring kirns be-
tween Australia and England—all except
Miss Hinder: her bags are labelled China
and Japan.
Conductor Joe Bradley staged a triumph
when he led the Philharmonics in Handel’s
“Israel in Egypt.” His baton seemed as
inspired as the rod of Aaron as it will-o’-the-
wisped through the Plagues and the terrific
double chorus, “He Gave Them Hailstones for
Rain,” descriptive of the storm in the desert.
The soloists were contralto Essie Ackland,
soprano Elsie Findlay and tenor Mervyn
Archdall; and the heavyweight bass solos
were shared by Reginald Gooud and Oliver
King. The Philharmonics’ next big work
will be “The Messiah.” This will be the
last production conducted by Mr. Bradley
before he leaves for England in January.
A happy little Sydney party had just
finished a tour of Scotland and the English
Lakes when the last mail left London. In
it were the Lucases (he is in Europe on
ex-German New Guinea business), Mrs.
Willis (her late husband used to be medical
officer of N.S.W. schools), Miss Steele (she
used to bo matron of Clarmore), the two
Macleod girls of Mosman, a daughter of Dr.
Arthur, and two or three others. The
Trossachs, which they crossed on the way
from Edinburgh to Oban, were not kind: the
heather was all it ought to be, but the
weather wasn’t. From Oban (whence you
can get to the Hebrides if you want to, and
visit the island of Lewes that Lord Lever-
liulme bought) the party turned south to
Glasgow, taking in Loch Awe, where if you
are lucky you can get the finest reflections in
the world (though the Wanganui’s claims
are not to be sneezed at), and so down
through the placid country that Wordsworth
wrote his lullabies about.
Miss Henderson is the guest of Miss
Macarthur Onslow at Camden Park until she
leaves for Europe in January. She. travels
north, and will stay en route with friends in
Java. In England she will engage in
work similar to that which she was
doing with the Australian Board of Missions
before she left to take up the more exciting
job of private secretary at Government
House—the first woman p.s. that an Austra-
lian Government House has known.
North Sydney lost a daughter of two of
its first inhabitants when Mrs. A. Johnson
died recently. She was born 80 years ago;
and it hadn't become a habit to be born in
North Sydney then. Her father was that
Robert Blue after whom one of the points
of the now well-grown suburb was named.
Pauline McMorran will be married to her
choice of the Walker twins —they are Miss
Eadith’s nephews—just as this epistle is
being buttoned into its print pinny. The
frock is a wondrous affair of ivory drawings,
its virgin folds never desecrated by a scis-
sors. Three wax-like camellias bloom just
below the right hip. and the same dignified
flower will moor the Limerick lace veil.
Mary Langtree is cast as bridesmaid.
Visiting Sydney is a versatile woman
whom Perth knew as Mary Poster, but who
recently married Dr. Charles Mattei, of
Brisbane. In the Western capital she
wrote, helped to run a political organisation,
founded a Union of Soldiers’ Wives and
Mothers, devised a system of scholarships
for Diggers’ children and conducted a library.
Ernest Laurence, who was once “Hop’s"
“little boy from Manly,” but now sells law
mingled with grey-haired experience, staged
a fete in his pretty gardens at Stratlifield in
aid of the Woolloomooloo free kindergarten
a few days ago. Mrs. Laurence organised
the venture, and felt that her efforts had met
with their due success when the day’s takings
mounted to £250.
Night tennis is growing in popularity, and
all over the suburbs courts are being fitted
with the necessary lighting apparatus. Now
a Raudwick dame has had a “tennis-dance.”
She advised her guests to come in tennis-
clothes ; and those who got tired of the tennis
found that dancing in easy garments had
many points.
A travelling Sydney girl who has, by
strict attention to the business, reached
almost the front line of Sydney society,
wrote a letter to a friend the other day from
Claridge’s. It shouted of acquaintance with
the Uppah Classes in every line. She had,
she said, been at a garden-party where one
duke handed her strawberries and another
duke passed her the sugar. “Well,” purred
the Sydney cat, “isn’t it a good job the
German waiter is gone from London! It
leaves all those light jobs open for the New
Poor.”
A Brisbane postscript:—-
The other night the Trocadero turned itself into
a bit of the Orient for a “Dust of the Desert’’ ball.
The Pyramids, the Sphinx, mosques, minarets, domes
and bazaars were all in the picture; the musicians
were dressed as Mecca pilgrims, the ushers sported
Eastern robes ; and Gloria Arndell, in white and
silver, did Eastern dances during the evening. A
big crowd turned up, including the J. L. Woolcocks,
Mowbray Thompsons, Mrs. Henry, Irma Deardon,
Oapt. (larboard, Mrs. P. J. Symes and Denise
D’Ennett;'
Brisbane racegoers sprinted to Ascot for Derby
Day. Mrs. A. H. Whittingham, in black josette
witli almond-green touches on her cape-line; Mrs.
Arthur Clarke, in sulphur linen; and Mrs. E. K.
Tully, in navy, were among the notable dressers.
A dinner was given on the .Eneas on the Bth to
which the King girls, the Craigs, Beryl Dinsdale and
Kathleen Forrest were bidden. Jazz and “travel
talk” divided the evening. The Orsova, all bespangled
with electrics, went one better with a ball. Two
bands played and supper was served in both saloons
amid flannel-flowers and roses brought from Sydney
in the ice chamber. Capt. Mathewson and his officers
received the guests, a nd everybody had a great time.
Naturalist A. H. Chisholm, now of Sydney, and
Olive Haseler, of Brisbane, slipped quietly round
the corner and got married a few days ago, after
which they inspected Canungra and listened to the
bird-songs at Tambourine and Beechwood before
flitting south. Several functions were given in their
honor, including a big dinner by the bride’s father
at Lennon’s Hotel. The following morning the
R.A.O.U. and others gathered at the Botanic Gar-
dens kiosk, when Henry Tryon, the Government Ento-
mologist, on behalf of the birdlovers, handed
Chisholm an order for Cayley’s “Australian
Birds,” and an address, which stressed the
services he had rendered the birds and other
natural beauties of Queensland during his seven years
on the Daily M«l.
“Dust of the Desert,” in which Society loomed
large, held the stage at His Majesty’s, in aid of
the Children’s Hospital, after Grossmith went south.
It made a fine spectacle—color scheme and flocking
both gorgeous. Captain Roy Shaw sang “Ah, Moon
of My Delight,” and Alec Sloane bore the burden of
being the late Tutankhamen. Harry Borradale was
the Soothsayer, and John Flower the muezzin; Rene
Stanners and Jean MacTaggart were singing slaves,
Edith Barry danced entrancingly as Astaroth, and
Lyon Begbie had a strenuous time as producer.
Death has just robbed Dalbv of its only centen-
arian—Mrs. Margaret Flynn, who came from Ireland
in 1856 and settled in Jimbour. Her husband was
drowned in Myall Creek away back in 1890.

THE LAFFARGUE DYNACHORD is an instrument
developed from the Player and the Piano, and probably
the first exponent of this new and charming phase of
musical art.
The Laffargue Dynachord repeats the very sounds
produced by the artist, the touch of his fingers on the
keys—it gives you not only the tempo and cadence, but
the charm, individuality and technique of his playing
in every detail.
The Laffargue Dynachord is equipped with devices by
which the operator personally controls the application of
all the degrees of force, the accent on any note or chord,
the control of tempo; also the control of the solo or
divided soft-pedal buttons and the sustaining pedal.
When played by electric operation this power is taken
from the usual power plug, and the cost is trifling.

MISSESE MONKE DOVLE
Phones central 1532, 1533.
Cup Day at Flemington was a fearsome
pack; the crowds that surged over the ter-
race and lawns suggested Flinders-street sta-
tion during the 5 o’clock rush. The best
people and the best frockers seemed to have
been washed away by the strike panic, but
perhaps they really were there. The only
persons who looked comfortable were the
double-barrelled vice-regal group and the com-
mittee-people ; these could flutter from their
seats to the terrace and betting-ring without
condemning themselves to stand for the rest
of the afternoon. Time was when the lesser
surburban racegoers deferred to Toorak. The
Best Gilded then pegged out an undisputed
claim to the section to the right of the stand
alongside the vice-regal pew—made a sort of
extended vice regal reserve of it, in fact.
But the present motley mixture known as
Melbourne Society is swamped by the general
public, which doesn’t know who’s who—and
doesn’t want to, either.
The Forsters made a fine old-world en-
trance and exit in a postillioned four-hoss
shay. The G.-G. cooled the landscape in
grey tailorings with a topper to match, but
the women of the group struck a rather dis-
mal note in black, brown or grey, though
Mrs. Pitt Rivers's orange and green jazz-
patterned hat shrieked above it triumphantly,
and Lady Helena Rous’s almond-green sum-
mit smote its neutral-tinted surroundings
colorfully. Mrs. Pat Osborne, who has been
nursing a sprained ankle since crossing from
the Ma State, was out for the first time, in
black tailorings; and Kath Osborne, also
from Sydney, could not be missed in vivid
yellow.
An overcrowded list of jazz events for the
Cup season was blown off the calendar by
the battle of Boni’ke-street, and the wail of
the Sassiety flapper is loud in the laud. “It
is worse than the war,” howled one habitual
trotter, “for that didn’t knock out dancing.”
The only trots to survive the upheaval were
the rival frivols hostessed by Mrs. Leigh
Falkiner and the Everard Browne daughters.
Even at these a number of dancing-mefi de-
faulted to do their bit in restoring order
in the city as special constables. At time
of writing the debs., defrauded of their
parties, are working off steam by helping to
feed the specials at the Town Hall.
The squad of police-strike “specials” in
the Exhibition-Bourke-street section, which
dubbed itself the “Gun-alley Bunch,” in-
cluded members of the first families. At the
first muster the senior-constable —a “regular”
—was calling the rolls, and had ticked off 11
“swell” names, when he stopped, drew his
pencil through the lot, and said, “We’ve had
of this guff! Now give’s y’r real
names.” The 11 had difficulty in convincing
him that they were not sailing under false
colors. Then, grinning, he said, “Good for
you! Takes us back to the A.I.F. when
everybody butted in with the rest.”
The yarn goes that the 75-year-old Sir
William Macewen, lion, surgeon to George
Rex, who has dropped down on us for the
Medical Congress, was in the first rush to
be sworn in as a special constable, and was
armed with the white sleeveband and waddy
to help to keep the peace in one disturbed
city quarter ; but some bright intellect, dis-
covering the disguised knight in a squad just
moving off for duty, gave the show away,
and he was pulled out. Sir William, by
the way, besides being a noted authority
on human flesh and bone, knows more about
the antlers of a deer, how they are grown
and shed, than any other man alive.
The Federal Government House lawn
party provided a’ welcome oasis in the desert
of the week’s social slump. The sun shone
obligingly at the eleventh hour, and tempted
many misguided females to shiver in their
thinnest summer raiment; but the majority
wisely plumped for comfort and warmer
clothing. The vice-regals lined up on the
lower lawn for their handshaking ordeal, she
in flowing draperies of brown silk lace under
sable wrappings, and a brown hat with
bunched feathers. It was noted—thanks
be!—that the charity bob imported by the
Nortlicotes is dying a natural death. The
State Governor and his jazzing Countess
stood below the Federal pair, she looking
paler than of old in trailing coppery-gold
mediseval hangings, circumferenced by a
tasselled cord, and backed with a cape to
match, the whole topped by a black picture-
hat with a gold rose perched thereon. Below
these again stood her South Australian Ex.,
Lady Bridges, with ermines warming her
black frock. Mrs. Pitt Rivers, who didn't
line up with the official procession, moved
round in mauve crepe drapings hemmed at
the edges with pale purple. Everyone of any
social importance seemed to have been asked
in, and most of them found the pleasant
gathering all too short. Several freak frocks
provided food for discussion, and an injudi-
cious over-application of bloom of roses and
lipstick vulgarised many an otherwise attrac-
tive face. Tea was spread in the ballroom,
where pink roses decorated the food supply,
and in the ball-parlor, under a growth of
blue delphiniums; and bands played cheer-
fully at both ends of the lawns.
One. of the best-dressed there was Mrs.
Harry Payne, who trailed ficelle silk with a
lace-edged cape effect. Mrs. Littleton Groom’s
grey crepe also called for special comment,
blushing rosily in the long hanging sleeve
linings, and crowned with a black hat. Mrs.
Balcombe, who crossed from Sydney last
month with her daughter to stay with her
husband’s Melbourne relations, sported one
of the nicest black-and-white frocks on view,
and her daughter wore Spring-like green.
Mrs. Frank Clarke was in blue silk, which
clung to her in spots with the ardor of a
sticking-plaster. Mrs. W. E. Manser, in
black marocain, brought her attractive
younger daughter, Brenda, and the Herbert
Power widow struck a pleasing effect in mag-
pie colorings. Teddy Dyson actually turned
out to convoy his other half and her sister
to the party, and, furthermore, looked as if
he liked it. Squatter Thomas Millear also
brought his handsome wife. The vice-regal
garden party seems to be the one social occa-
sion on which wives can confidently count on
their husbands accompanying them.
Mrs. John Tremearne, here depicted by
Rembrandt, is the president of the Gentle-
women’s Aid Society, a job that was given
her after many active years as a committee-
worker. The
society, long
suffering from
lack of lime-
light, is an
untold bless-
ing to many
elderly or in-
valid gentle-
women who,
without it,
would go
with unbut-
tered crusts.
It provides
them with a
market for
what handi-
crafts they
have, not only
through the
half - yeai’ly
sales, but
among • cus-
tomers en-
rolled by the
committee and its secretary, Miss Flower.
Mrs. Tremearne, who is the widow of the
well-known Melbourne medico, succeeded
Mrs. Norman Bayles in the presidential
chair. She is likewise vice-president of the
Toorak sector of the Women’s League, and
is one of the keenest workers associated with
the free kindergarten movement. She had
two fine-looking sons in the Great War, and,
alas! the elder. Major Tremearne, who had
already had a distinguished career, fell early.
The hospitality end of the Medical Con-
gress opened out on Saturday afternoon with
an at-home in No. 9 Darling-street. The
room was glorious with the purples and
pinks of massed rhododendron blooms, and
an orchestra made pleasant noises in the
offing. The Harry Allen dame, becomingly
brown-frocked. and hatted, and surgeon
George Syme’s other half, gracefully sup-
porting magpie silk winged with white, took
the salute by the doorway, whereafter the
nominal hostesses, Mesdames F. .T. and Jack
OJendinnen, Taylor Downie, Herbert Hew-
lett, R. J. Berry, Julian Smith and Hugh
Devine, called the visiting strangers under
their wings for introductions and chat. The
organisation of the affair was a masterpiece
of strategy. Bridge cards lay neglected
while medicoes, gathered in from all quar-
ters, rapturously pushed back the years in
the renewal of auld acquaintance with former
confreres and college chums. It was truly
a day of reunions. Prof. Harry Allen got
his first real outing since his recent long
illness, but was carried off early in the after-
noon by his youngest daughter, Biddy.
The teacups rattled in two rooms amid
splashes of pink carnations. Two special boards
had been spread for the vice-regal guests,
who, however, dropped in late from the race
meeting. Lady Forster was in black and an
ermine wrap, and had a bunch of blue
feathers on her hat; and Mrs. Pitt Rivers
shepherded her mother in pale green checks
and a droopy black lid. The Countess Strad-
broke maroeained her graceful length in cin-
namon-brown pleatings with a back cape, and
tucked her brown head into a becoming
ostrich-feathered hat of china-blue. Hester
Phillimore fluttered near by in pale green.
Among the Sydney medical contingent were
the spectacled Fiaschi and his wife, the
latter striking a pleasing note in reddish
brown with a transparent lace brim shading
her smiles. Cheery Dr. Morris Humphrey
and his equally cheerful petticoated half
popularised themselves generally from the
first minute of their arrival, she black-
frocked under a grey-feathered stole. Dr.
and Mrs. Maehin, Dr. and Mrs. MacDonald
(M.L.) and Dr. and Mrs. Cameron (Q.) all
foregathered happily. The lady medicoes
grouped round Dr. Peggy McLorinan, who
pleased the eye in dove-grey silk with a
cape collar and hat trimmings as blue as her
eyes.
Most of our own first bone-sawyers and
-setters were there, some looking like lambs
dragged to the slaughter; but just a few
had funked the social gathering and sent
their wives to represent them. Dr. and Mrs.
Teddy Downes, the Kent Hugheses, Talbot
Bretts, Fyffes and McAdams were sighted
in the crowd. A handful of non-medicals
had been invited, among them the popular
Harry Emmerton pair.
Among the medical conferencers is Dr.
Elizabeth Gunn, of the Maoriland Public
Health Department. Her specialty is the
health of scholars and the hygienic adminis-
tration of schools, in which subjects she has
done a formidable amount of research work.
One of the matrons who were directing a
recent big charity ball had duly mapped out
the plan of the supper table whereat the
vice-regal guests were to eat with those con-
cerned in launching the thing. But when it
came to sitting down it was discovered that
members of the local peerage had been shep-
herded into the seats set for the officials,
though they weren’t supposed to be at that
particular eating at all. Apparently some-
body with an embarrassing worship of titles
had thought the handles to people’s names en-
titled them to be seated among the mighty.
But what that matron is saying under her
breath, and just a little over it, is a shame.
Mrs. Jack Fisken, Mrs. Tommy Grantham
and Mrs. Leslie Macphferson launched a
Derby Sunday tea at the Maepliersons’ Too-
rak place, Warrawee. The call for special
constables, however, thinned the expected
male leavening almost to vanishing-point.
Mrs. Fisken’s raven hangings were livened up
by Oriental colors under an all-black hat;
Mrs. Macpherson (she and her sister were
McCaugheys) radiated in the overworked
cinnamon brown with a relieving dash of
red and gold in her hat, while Mrs. Grantham
maroeained herself like a nicely-done biscuit,
and posied her hat with brown leaves. Tea-
and-talk was reinforced by trips round the
garden, which has terraces and clipped yew-
trees, quite in the English style, put there
by the original owner, Rutter Clarke. Among
the company were Mrs. Sam McCaughey,
General White and his lady, Mrs. Julian
Macka.v, Mrs. Pat Osborne, Mrs. Watson and
Carmen Watson, and Mrs. George Black-
wood, who is feeling in more cheerful mood
since her husband’s health began to behave
itself.
This sensitive face belongs to David
Howley, IS year-old ’cellist, whose soulful
notes have been attracting some attention in
the musical
world. He is a
pupil of Ilat-
tenbaeh, but
got his earlier
training with
Arthur Mon-
tague. The lad
earns his crust
with the Prin-
cess’s Theatre
o r chestra,
which entrusts
him with the
’cello solos,
but he has had
some valuable
platform ex-
perience with
an instrumen-
tal trio, and
further with
Claude Dam-
pier’s “Dan-
dies” on tour.
Young David, who has hitched his waggon
to a star, is looking forward to the time
when he can join that band of Australians
who have gone hunting for laurels on the
other side of the world.
Mrs. Adelaide Barrow, who lives at
Twickenham Ferry, Burnley, and whose
years number 89, declares that she remem-
bers her father running a farm on the spot
where the Melbourne G.P.O. now stands, at
the corner of Bourke and Elizabeth streets.
That was away back in ’42. She used to
go down to the Yarra and carry up water
for the house, and vows that sometimes she
was helped up the slippery bank by Governor
Latrobe, who was not above humping his
own bath-water to his three-roomed hut on
Batman’s Hill. For TO years the old lady
has lived beside the stream, though she was
temporarily driven out by flood in ’65 and ’9l.
The Melba Con.’s forthcoming revival of
“Dido and /Eneas” is making a stir in musi-
cal quarters, and Fritz Hart confidently pre-
dicts that he is about to surpass his previous
record in every direction. The little man
will have a tough job to fulfil this threat,
seeing that a whole constellation of vocal
stars who have since made good across seas
were associated in the previous production.
Among these were Stella Power, Strella Wil-
son, Gertrude Johnson. Margaret Jewell and
Browning Mummery.
The Mermaid Repertories will finish up
their 1923 season at the Playhouse on Friday
and Saturday nights with “The Romantic
Young Lady.” a young person who will be
seen for the first time in this continent. This
play will leave just enough time to fit in a
locally-written curtain-raiser by Norman
Simpson. It was hoped that Mrs. Pitt Rivers
would have starred as the romantic young
thing, but as she has a previous engagement
with “Pygmalion” Mrs. Apperly will go on in
her stead. The latter lady will shortly trip to
her native Ireland to introduce her two
babies to their maternal relatives.
Judging by certain recent happenings, the
denizens of the underworld are not the only
Melbourne vandals. Some ultra-swish flap-
pers belong to the same queer order. At a
smart-set dance-party the other night over
£2OO worth of damage was done to the hos-
tess's opulent turkey squares by young social
bolshevists, who cheerfully threw the lighted
butts of their half-smoked cigarettes on the
carpets with a superb disregard for the con-
sequences.
Dropping into tin* nearest hotel cafe for a
late dinner while he was directing police-strike
operations, Premier Lawson found opposite
him at the table a stranger Avho wanted to
tell him all about the riots and “the week-
kneed Government” responsible for them.
Lawson, with an assumption of innocence,
asked what Government —Federal or State—
was responsible. “Both,” replied the man
who knew all things; “and,” said he, “they’re
much of a muchness.” The waitress told the
Cup visitor afterwards the name of the stal-
wart with the clean-shaven face and the
slightly bald head who had listened well and
said little —and the stranger looked for a
moment as though the savory hadn’t agreed
with him.
The Charity nuns, who conduct St. John’s
School, Clifton Hill, have secured for a resi-
dential convent the house of Mrs. Wilkins,
widow of the man who used to be one of the
members for Collingwood in the Assembly. It
was when Wilkins developed from a retail
butcher into a minor sort of Angliss that he
bought this big place in North-terrace.
Some Adelaide gossip :
The Cup and Medical Congress in Melbourne made
a social hiatus here. Among those who went with
a special eye on the conference were the T. U.
Wilsons and the Harry Gilberts, Dr. Gertrude Halley
(who is fitting in a conference of school medical
officers at the same time), Dr. Violet Plummer and
her sister, and Dr. Effie Robertson. The last men-
tioned has even more important business afoot—-
she is to be married on November 17 in Scots’
Church to Ronald Hone. Popular Abe Shannon is
to be best. man.
Lois Wendt finds India so attractive that she is
staying on till March, and plans to see Delhi, Agra,
Peshawar and the Ivhyber Pass. The Cecil Brays,
who have been in England since early in the year,
are due back just after the New Year.
A bridge party at the Home for Incurables
at Fullarton helped to raise funds for the patients’
stall at the Home’s fete. The Lavington Bonython,
Kidman, T. A. Corbin, Hugh Davis and Newbold
dames are listed among the other stallholders, and
Lady .Bridges is to give the show its opening blessing.
Trinity Church has had a fete, too, opened by
Mrs. A. A. Scarfe, whose father, T. W. Lyons, was
the church’s organist in the dim past. Trinity is
the oldest church here, tucked away in the
shadow of the railway bridge at the unfashionable
end of North-terrace, and specially beloved by new-
comers from England for its likeness to their own
village churches.
The Wordsworth Jameses are bound for England.
She is the enterprising lady who has given us coo-ee
songs and coo-ee mementoes of every imaginable
kind, as well as teaching us to sound the call cor-
rectly. During the war her coo-ee competitions
added a good many pounds to patriotic funds.
Joan Whitby has given a matrimonial promise to
a Sydneysider—flying-man Arthur Hyde Flower.
At least, his people are in Sydney, but he is sta-
tioned with his squadron at Ismailia.
After much talk it has been decided to move
the Cheer-up Hut, and its new home is to be in
Elder Park, on the banks of the Torrens. Coun-
cillor Lundie had his usual objections to make, on
the ground that the building was “ramshackle” and
had “served its purpose”; but the Hut has too
many associations to be lightly done away with.
And, anyway, the Board has promised that when it
is moved it shall be duly titivated.
Cecilia John, who has been working with the
Save the Children Fund overseas, has arrived on
an organising and lecturing tour, and is putting in
a busy -time conferring with the local committee,
addressing meetings and so on. With her is Miss
D :iver; her hobby is eurhythmies, and she gave a
delightful exposition of them one evening.
Bishop Thomas and his wife had the ill-luck to
strike a vile day for their garden party at Bishop’s
Court, and wisely gave guests their tea in the cool
comfort of the house. Mrs. Thomas, who was in
silver grey, had two smill pink-frocked daughters
to help her in looking after her guests. These in-
cluded the ex-Mayoral Cohens, the Btitler dame and
her daughter, the Justice Pooles and everyone who
is any one in the Anglican world.

PROPERY
These four-day meetings at Flemmgton,
as at Randwick, present a dragged-out appearance
in the closing stages, despite the attendance of
punters who are eithe.’ playing up their previous
winnings or going for a recovery. Figures speak
for themselves. On V.R.C. Derby Day 75 horses
started in six events. On Cup Day the number was
94. But on Oaks Day it had dropped to 44, and
on the last day the highest number of starters for a
race was 11, whilst two events attracted only five to
the barrier.
Punters who favor Sydney horses suffered two par-
ticuiar disappointments. The first was when
Rivoli failed to sustain his run in the Melbourne
Cup. It is one thing to overhaul horses in a w.f.a.
race of 10, or even 12 furlongs, and quite another
thing to chase a six-year-old who has two stone the
best of the handicap at the end of a top-speed two
miles. The second disappointment was when Claro
proved incapable of giving Maid of the Mist two or
three lengths’ start in the mile race on Oaks Day.
The English horse, at the turn into the straight, got
almost to the girths of the flyaway mare, and then
came the shout that Claro was “’ome and dry.” His
speed in the Epsom and on the Sydney training track
was declared to be invincible, and having almost
caught Maid of the Mist he had only to go on and
win. But Claro could gain no more on the leader.
He lost a little, instead of gaining.
The matter with David, seemingly, is that his
periods of fitness are briefer than those of say, an
Easingwold, or even a Rivoli. Three years in suc-
cession David has been nowhere in Melbourne Cup.
He may run great races at Randwick in October, in
which case he cuts no ice at Flemington in Novem-
ber. Or if he is a winning David at Randwick in
April his triumphs have perhaps been preceded by
failures at Caulfield and the V.R.C. meeting in
February and .March. Running in the C. B. Fisher
Plate on Saturday poor old David (who seems to
get less black and more brown as he grows older)
was an animal of no importance. Rushed to the
front when the pace was slow, he couldn’t hold his
place when matters got interesting. At the end of
the mjle and a half, David was last of five, whereas
his old opponent Rivoli had shown his stamina by
running past Maid of the Mist and Easingwold, con-
sistent always.
It was up to Happy Queen to score her win in
the V.R.C. Handicap. At six years the imported
mare had run only eight times. Last season and this
she has been a more frequent performer, and in
March last she won her first race —at Flemington.
Then she went to Sydney for the Easter meeting, and
ran second to Mufti in a handicap, after finishing
sixth in the Sydney Cup. Probably the Queen is a
little better than she was in her young days, but
it didn’t need much to carry 6st. 121b. ahead of
four moderate handicap horses in a 14-furlongs race.
The last three races of the meeting were sweet
things for Shortodds, and the Final Handicap must
have been his most satisfactory betting race for
the week. In one ’espect it was the most interesting
to students of the game, because the victory of Our
Prince suggested that a new stayer had come to
light in Sol Green’s imported six-year-old. Having
won an 11-furlongs race at Williamstown on the
previous day, and been penalised 71b., Our Prince
was neglected by most punters, though he was only
asked to do what might be demanded of any horse
in England, viz., win two days running. The gaiiop
at Wiiliamstown had evidently improved him. Here
he stalled off Note and Sono a even more decidedly
than he had stalled off a couple of third-raters in
the Wiiliamstown November Handicap. There is
time for Our Prince to improve further and act
quite up to his appearance, it takes some of this
imported stuff a long time to get acclimatised.
Note was the unlucky lady of a round in which
other mares had a great time, Wynette, Frances
Tiessady and Maid of the Mist, especially. In the
Moonee Valley Cup and the Carnival Handicap,
Purser’s little sister was knocked from pillar to
post. She had another rough passage in the Final Handi-
cap, in which she finished a close second. But in
the £2500 Wiiliamstown Cup she had a beautiful
run all the way. At the entrance to the straignc
she had her head in front; at the distance she was
clear of the field; at the half-distance the only
question that seemed undecided was what would
finish second and third. But, tiring, the Sydney
mare left a passage on the rails, and in a
flash Simmons drove Wynette through, to get home
in the last stride by half a head. The Caulfieiu
Cup winner was favorite at 5 to 2; Note, 12 s,
Polynesian, the third horse, 20’s. #
“Fax” : James Scobie’s two Cup wins with
matured horses of delicate constitution and no pre-
vious distinction speak well for the “old-fashioned
svstem of training which Scobie, perhaps, was edu-
cated in by the Ballarat trainers of yore. Alec Tay-
lor used to say that you could only! get out of a
horse what you put into him. To win a long-
distance race the horse had to be given a slow and
steady preparation. The animal must have stamina
developed by a different scheme of track work than
served to> get the miler into condition. Stayers were
born, but the trainer had the making of them into
Cup horses by patient endeavor. Getting them ready
for a long race was a loner job, and the idea of rac-
ing them in public meanwhile over short courses was
not. favored. So they said at Ballarat when Jim
Scobie was a smart young hurdle-race jockey.
“K. 0.”: The wasting that enabled young
Wilson to ride his second successive Cup winner at
7st. might have seemed a mistake had Bitalli been
as closely pressed as was King Ingoda, when the boy
rode a great finish against The Cypher last year.
Wilson, it was said after this Cup, had been starving
himself for two days in order to keep within a pound
of Bitalli’s handicap weight (6st. 131 b.). Whether
it is wiser to put a weakened boy on a biggish horse
for the sake of reducing its burden to 7st. than
to add a couple of pounds of meat to the rider s
strength will alwavs be questioned by physical-ciu-
turists. Horse-trainers attach enormous import-
ance to a couple of pounds in a two-miles Cup race,
but the point where the little more weight on the
boy becomes a greater advantage than a little less
off the ’orse has never been defined. Wilson was not
required to ride a desperate finish in the Cup, and
foi all other purposes he was strong enough, despite
his alleged abstention from food. Probably he took
less out of his young self than the older and some-
what larger jockey who rode Revenue to victory of
yore, after spending a day and a half in the Turkish
bath.

“0.K.” : The going-amiss of Shrapnel pre-
vious to the Vic. Derby, with a Cup engagement
to follow, was harder luck for owner and trainer than
even the breakdown of Heir Apparent on Derby Day.
A sound three-year-old is expetted to have a clear
vear or two of racing life before him, and an easy
chance of getting through the season without gob g
lame. But a five-year-old who has been in training
for months is a not unlikely subject for tragedy.
Heir Apparent’s long preparation for the Cup had
THE BITALLI TRIO.
J. Scobie, trainer; A. T. Craig, owner; and
A. Wilson, rider, of Melbourne Cup winner.
seemingly found him out in a back sinew, or a bit
of bad luck in the Hotham Handicap race did the job.
The adage that you can’t continue to take a pitcher
to the well without breaking it applies to racers.
Heir Apparent must have been evorth a lot of money
to the books, for there was no haunting dread of the
Sydney Cup runner-up going amiss as had been tne
ease with Sister Olive, whose breakdown on the eve
of last Australian Cup was said at the time to be
final and complete. The mare, 'as it happened, took
her place in the Melbourne Cup field, though her
doubtful leg was again looking shaky and punters
were shy. She made a bold show in the first half-
mile before dropping back to a lame conclusion.
“Fax”: The Derby winner and runner-up
this year must have been the slowest beginners, for
young people, that ever got mixed up with the mob in
the first half of a Melbourne Cup race. Whereas Drongo
w'as an awkward colt with whom the small boj' aboard
could do nothing, Frances Tressady was seemingly
just a timid young woman, fearful of being pushed
about by a lot of rough fellow-creatures. The Ally
might easily have been blocked and disheartened in
the Derby, but the field was not large, and fortune
favored the fair. Her running in the last stages of
the Cup, when the crowd ahead of her had thinned
down, indicated that Frances Tressady is a pretty
good stayer.
Royal Howard, a recruit from the grass-
feds —he won two laces of that description in West-
ern Queensland —was the hero of the Q.T.C. Spring
meeting. Third favorite at 6’s, and carrying 61b.
more than the 6st. 91b. at which he had been handi-
capped, he beat Spreadeagle (absolute favorite),
Kelso’s cast-off Picardy and nine others in the
Queensland Cup, running the two miles in 3min.
27sec. He had 7st. 61b. in the 10-furlongs Sand-
gate Handicap, but his stylish manner of account-
ing for P ickles (winner of two w.f.a. races), Borro-
song and six others suggested that another 211 b.
wouldn’t have stopped him. A five-year-old brown geld-
ing by imported Lord Howard out of Vernonia (Royal
Artillery—Veronique), Royal Howard was trained
by Pat* Ryan and ridden by A. Davis. His owner,
J. McCormack, bought him as a yea ling for 55
guineas at the Sydney sales.
“The Deacon” : There are so many well-
known ways of throwing away a race that a new
one seems impossible. Yet this is what happened to
a jock, who had been riding successfully over hurdles
in the country. He guilelessly men-
tioned at the starting-gate that he
was on a sure thing, but that it
was his first ride on a city course.
Thereupon he was strongly recom-
mended to keep a bit in hand for the
gruelling third time round. This the
youth did. Chuckling to himself, he
rode his mount behind the straining,
flogging leaders at the end of the
second spasm. The post was on
him before he woke up, and then,
in addition to his cup of misery, the
stewards blew seven bells out of him.
His obvious honesty alone saved the
situation. The next time young Bulls-
wool appeared at the barrier he cocKcd
a deaf ear to the advice ladled out,
and made every post a winner.
There is a deepening suspicion that Batnos,
by Absurd-Amyrin, was the smartest sprinter among
the M.L. three-year-olds brought to Sydney ior tno
Spring meetings. On the principle that little fish
are sweet, the brown’s lady owner is running him
in suburban handicaps, and at Canterbury Park on
Saturday (it was the Rosehill Club’s meeting), with
9st. 91b. up, he romped home in a Flying Welter,
beating Perfume pointless. Easing up at the finish,
he ran the' six furlongs in lmin. 14Jsec. —good
time for the dusty Canterbury course. A race like
the Carrington Stakes should suit this brilliant fellow,
or the Villiers Stakes, if he can go a mile. And
Tremolo will have to be considered for one of the
long-distance engagements at Christmas-time. He
was doing well at the end of the Rosehill Handicap,
though not quite so well as old Impeyan, and his
condition can be improved.
“Sol S.”: The story goes that Campbell
and Du Frocq, who revived track-cycling on Mel-
bourne Exhibition Oval last summer, cleaned-up
something like £6OOO after paying £ 1000-odd for the
Oval. Hence a blackguard rush of rival promoters
for this summer's rights. The Oval trustees, who
include Carlton’s Labor member, Bob Solly, rejected
Campbell and Du Frocq’s tender and awarded the
concession to C. E. Lynam, a former Westraliar.
Hansard reporter, who took the Young Australia
boys through America in 1908 and afterwards pro-
moted skating in various Australian cities. Lynam
immediately signed up Harris Border and Stumpy
Hammond, cabled to America for Willie Spencer,
and sought the patronage of the peculiarly-constructed
League of Victorian Wheelmen. On this body sit
representatives of the trade —-rubber and rims—and
beth Campbell and Du Frocq as promoters’ reps. ,
and great was the lobbying that went on until Lynam
finally scored full sanction for his meetings by
six votes to four. Lynam now has the riders, the
only track existing in Melbourne, and the chance
of big gates for the summer. Campbell and Du
Frocq have the Sydney Sports Ground, and an
option over cycling rights at the Melb. Amateui
Sports Ground on Batman-avenue. There is talk
of their having a track there by January, and making
Lvnam “go for his life.”
* * * *
“Wilfrido”: No precedent could be cited
for a recent M.L. case in which the Wairarapa
Automobile Association sued the holder of the Vice-
President’s Cup for its return. The trophy became
the property of the winner on his being the first
to reach the tapes two years, not necessarily in
succession; but the club, owing to the difficulty of
procuring a suitable race-track, had not held a
meeting since Februarv, 1921. Scorning to call in
the assistance of a wig, defendant hotly protested
that the trophy was his until someone else gained
it and that he had an interest in it to the extent,
that another victory would make it his for good and
all. The beak this view of the case, but
warned the orator that, if for any reason there
was no possibility of holding another meeting, he
might have to hand the bauble back.
* * * *
J. O. Anderson remains as much of an
amateur as he is for the sole reason, apparently,
that there is less money in being a pro. Meanwhile,
the L. T. Association has no more hope of resisting
his demands than a boxing-promoter would have of
cutting Dempsey’s price for a big bout. When the
L T. Association hesitated about paying the Davis
Cup expenses of J.O.’s wife he threatened not to
go, and he did the same when the harassed con-
trolle s jibbed at “recompensing his business for
any losses it might incur through his absence.” He
now wants the L. T. A. to pay him a large sum
and put business in the way of his firm, and as the
people at headquarters, who have no love for him
or his methods, are reluctant, he has “retired from
the game for good.” That is, of course, till the
next series of big matches app oaches. There will
then be a press uproar about the national shame of
facing the enemy with a weak team, and the im-
pression will be created that, unless Anderson is won
back to the ball-bashing front on any terms, a
scandalised public will cease to support tennis, and
the game will fall into desuetude and decay. It
would save a lot of worry' and argument if Ander-
son made out a full list of his demands, the same
to stand during the rest of his career as a. champion.
The association could then take Jfiem or leave taem.
On the concluding day of the A.A. A. s
championship meeting, two alterations were made m
the N.S.W. record-book. W. F. Payne, a finely-
built policeman, hurled the discus 113 ft. ojin., vvmcn
was 15in. better than K. J. Naukler s .State figures
(Naukler was the Finnish Consul who died tragically
a year or two ago) ; and R. J. Honner, by winning
the 440yds. hurdle race in 57 2-ssec., established
new time for both Commonwealth and State, this
on a most unsatisfactory track. There was. a
rumpus after the mile race on Nov. 3, and neither
H L. Grandemange nor Hatton, the Englishman,
came ’ out for the three-miler, which one of them
would most likely have won. In their absence, G.
Morton succeeded to the title in 16min. 124 sec.
Goldsworthy, the Queenslander, followed up his suc-
cess in the 100yds. by taking the 220 in 24sec.
Queensland form 'is evidently very good, for, judging
by recent performances, Goldsworthy is inferior
over the hundred to 11. V. Scouller, and over the
furlong to Norman Grehan. In the 220 yards State

“Nitric”: If Melbourne rules prevailed m
Brisbane, Queensland Uni. would also boast a
quadruple blue (B. 8/11/’23). W. C. Browne has
earned blazers for football, cricket and rowing, and
in cricket, football and rifle-shooting (not yet a
qualifying pastime) he has represented his State,
Also he can manage a Lewis-gun as well as a rifle,
and is not so dusty with the gloves. He got a
place in the ’Varsity eight two months after he had
first handled an oar.

As in 1921 and ’22 the N.S.W. eigllt-oar
championship was easy for Mosman. Drummoyne were
nearest to O’Callaghan’s crew at the finish, but there
were 20 lengths between them, with University out
of it. In A. G. Bull’s absence (he was unable to
get a boat) W. Robertson (Leichhardt) won the
sculls stylishly from Nielson (Balmain), who made
a >' aee . of it ' with Bull last year. Robertson is a
promising youth, and the Olympic selectors will have
t 0 eye on him. # #

Departing from precedent, the N.S.W.
selection committee has chosen 36 players to practise
for the Sheffield Shield matches. -It also means to
see if there are any likely Howells and McKibbins
among the 50 countrymen who are soon to descend
upon Sydney,

“Tron” ; A rising star is Hans Ebeling, of
Melbourne. Because of his ability last year with
the Caulfield Grammar School, the M.C.C. gave him
a geagon ticket and a trial in its first eleven. Then
, he y.C.A. included the 18-year-old express in the
representative team against Maryborough, and he
bagged two wickets for six runs. This year the
youngster has come right to the front. In three
matches he has taken 19 wickets at an average of
10.8, Ryder, Love, Hartkopf, “Ches” Brown and
Yeomans being among his victims. The Vic. colts,
with three such fast youngsters as Ebeling, Gamble
(of Hawthorn East), Philpott (of Carlton) and a host
of budding googlers to choose from, will have a for-
midable attack.

Moved by the unmerciful hiding their first
e i even g o t from a Vic. second eleven last season,
the y as _ a uthorities are making a serious attempt
to j m p ro ve the standard of play. District cricket
bag been reintroduced, and, the number of clubs
having increased, many young fellows are to be
given a chance, denied them in former vears, to plav
0 n turf. The T.C.A. can afford to open its shoulders,
it has been placed in that position by the labors
0 f a band of enthusiasts, notably H. C. Smith, who
wasn’t above taking a turn at the mower or roller
when the Association couldn’t afford to emplov a
groundsman. Smith is retiring from the secretarial
job he filled, unpaid, for years, but he will still
play for North-west Hobart, and represent the Speck
on the Board of Control.
THE SPORT OF KINGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“At Stringhalt Park, when Frozen Meat won a race,
the trainer showed his resentment by hitting a well-
known punter on the nose, breaking it in two places.
He told the stewards, in extenuation of his conduct,
that he suspected the punter of having ‘livened’ the
horse on him.”
For clean sport, as you know,
I’ve a yearning intense.
Iloni —how does it go?—
Soit qui mal y pense.
But saltirg the tail of a trainer, I reckon, is over
the fence.
The jockey well knew,
For I’d liamme ed it in,
What the horse had to do
(And it wasn’t to win),
Yet that’s what he does in a canter. It hurt, I
can tell you, like sin.
He was “dead,” I can show,
As the odds would denote,
Till the very last mo.
In the .ring and the tote,
Then to see the darned prad resurrected! ’Strut'!,
wouldn’t it get anyone’s goat?
Fair play is a jewel,
We all may agree,
But if I was cruel
Was I crueller than he
When twice on the boko I clouted the blighter who’d
double-crossed me ?
The stewards will glare
As they bring me to book ;
There are things, they declare,
That they can’t overlook.
But how about livening a stiff ’un? Thank Gawd,
1 ain’t that sort o’ crook!
What’s coming to sport?
No good, I misdoubt,
But I shan’t squeal or snort
If they empty me out,
For, though on my ea I’m ejected I’ve set my mark
twice on his snout.

“Hobnobster" : The boss had been dictat-
ing a separation agreement, and Miss Type-
tapper had got it all right except the con-
cluding sentence. That came back to him as
follows: “That: these sums of money shall be
paid to my wife while she is chased !”
“Blanc”: Tell “Hambone” (B. 25/10/’23)
that Fritz’s infantry in Stormy Trench were
provided with the long saw-bayonets. In fact,
each Fritz seemed to have the kind of
bayonet that suited him best, as live distinct
varieties of toasters, besides trench daggers,
were found. But none were used against
the Diggers.
Naval-Commander Harold Chance, whose
daughter Myee was married recently, first
came to Sydney to join the Karrakatta —one
of the obsolete warships John Bull kept in
these waters. Wedding Sydney's wealthiest
heiress of the time, lie stayed here. His own
family is well-gilded, too. A doting mother
had built on him making a name in law.
but he ran away to sea, and when he had
been redeemed from the job of cabin-boy his
parents bowed their ambitions to his wishes
and he was put in the navy.
Ophir (N.S.W.) is to have an obelisk
with an inscription setting forth that it was
“Erected by the New South Wales Govern-
ment to commemorate the first discovery of
payable gold in Australia” ; and the names
of the men “responsible for the discovery"
are set out in this order: Edward Hammond
Hargreaves, John Hardman Australia Lis-
ter, James Tom, William Tom. The dis-
covery was made on Feb. 12, 1851.
Pat Doolan, blind beggar and sometime
itinerant showman, who died lately at Kil-
more (Vic.), supplied a curious example of
the miser’s tenacious hold upon his money.
Even when lie was dying he protested that
he was unable to contribute anything to tin l
hospital, and he allowed himself to be buried
as a pauper. Yet he was worth £2444. and
over £7OO of it was in cash. And, appa-
rently, there was nobody whom he regarded
sufficiently to leave his money to ; his estate,
by a will made a few years ago, goes to vari-
ous charities.
“O.K.’s” affidavit:—
There is a discussion in Melbourne concerning-
the Australian accent and its alleged vulgarity.
Judging from a long experience of Melbourne 1
say the proportion of cultivated accents among
people in comfortable circumstances has increased
vastly in 40 years. Certainly, the diction of Mel-
bourne girls who take to the stage has improved
out of all knowledge. Pattie Browne of old had to
be coached in refinement of speech after her intelli-
gence and natural dash had won her a position
as a soubrette. In her day girls from the chorus
who got lines to speak in a comics opera were
often incapable of a “ladylike” accent. Nowadays
the one who speaks badly is an exception.
“Oka” on an old Maoriland wreck:—
If “Green Seas” (B. 11/10/’ - 23) had been with
me in Easter of 1908 when the Penguin followed
us out of Wellington Heads into the teeth of a
southerly gale, he would have lost all idea that
the steamer didn’t steer well. There are many
good sailormen who have sailed in her, and 1
never heard one say that she was a bad sea boat.
Her loss was not due to “jigging,” for the moderate
gale blowing the night of the wreck was as nothing
to the gales she had been through, but to insuffi-
cient allowance for current, plus a thick mist. She
may not have struck a rock, for it was known that
a derelict was floating about the Cook Strait at
the time, but the fact that the skipper said “Toms
Rock” when he got ashore sealed the question for
him, both at the inquiry and the appeal.
“H.M.” : The roofs of Sydney, which have
spread like a terra-cotta fungus over all the
headlands south of the harbor entrance, are
likely to extend before long over the bush-
clad North Head also. Manly Council has
for years been agitating for the removal of
the Quarantine Station, and now a move-
ment has started in the State Parliament to
squeeze the Commonwealth Government into
shifting the station to Jervis Bay. Another
doomed area is the Victoria Barracks. Pad-
dington wants it as a place to grow rates
upon, and only a difference of opinion be-
tween the Commonwealth and State as to
the overlordship of the land has prevented a
transfer. But the Quarantine Station will
be a harder nut to crack—especially if the
too-remote Jervis Bay is the only alternative
offered.
“D.”: It is not necessary to agree with
the politics of Major-General Rosenthal to
experience irritation at this in a Sydney
daily:—
Men like Major-General Rosenthal, who in the
war were safe behind the lines, were conspicuous by
their absence.
The reference was to a soldier’s funeral. The
suggestion that Rosenthal shirks soldier
functions is absurd: the truth is he eats
them. But more serious is the suggestion
that “Rosie” avoided the line. As a matter
of fact, he had a passion for it which, in
conjunction with his terrific energy, was a
source of anguish to many of his subordi-
nates. His enormous figure might be seen
going the round of his batteries in action at
daybreak every morning; and if any further
testimony is needed it is to be got from the
row of “wounded” bars he wore when the
Armistice reached him.
“Jan-Os”: Some of the sympathy that
“Sucre” (B. 16/8/’23) lavishes on the
tomato-cocky might be diverted to the re-
tailers, the majority of whom are not
Italians. Retailers never get the full 241 b.
of tomatoes the half-bushel case theoreti-
cally contains, and an appreciable propor-
tion are unsaleable even when they do not
go bad. Again, the obvious impossibility of
serving the exact weight always tells against
the retailer, for, popular conception to the
contrary notwithstanding, the scales in
vegetable-shops invariably go down in the
buyer’s favor. Two months hence Sydney-
grown tomatoes will fetch to 265. per case
wholesale; Is. Id. per lb. will be the price
over the counter for as much of it as is not
inferior to unsaleability under the top-layer.
Were it not for the big southern cities
Bowen (Q.) cockies would have to sell their
undersized, pale-ripening tomatoes to each
other instead of reaping the profit of Gs. per
case.

“Joseph Entangled,” Henry Arthur
Jones’s three-act comedy in which Lawrence
Grossmith is starring at Sydney Criterion,
is rather thin stuff. The play dates from
about the same era as Pinero’s “Iris,” and
the London it presents seems more like 50
years away than 20. Owing to the blunder-
ing of servants Lady Verona Mayne and Sir
Joseph Lacy, who happen to have been
affianced lovers before the former’s marriage,
spend a night under the same roof—that of
the Maynes’ London residence —each in en-
tire ignorance of the other’s proximity, and
meet unexpectedly at breakfast in the morn-
ing. This naturally sets the tongue of scan-
dal wagging, and the other two acts are
occupied in tangling things up some more and
then in straightening them out. Sir Joseph
Lacy is an admirably-drawn character. He
suggests rather vividly Mr. Carter in
Anthony Hope’s “Dolly Dialogues,” and it
goes without saying that such a part is right
into Lawrence Grossmith’s hands. But the
others—the men at all events —recall nothing
in real life or reasonably realistic fiction.
They mostly look like tailors’ dummies —the
elegant and varied raiment of the male
actors is a much more pronounced feature
of the piece than the ladies’ frocking—and
they talk as long-windedly and with the
same air of preposterous unreality as Dick-
ens’s Micawbers and Pecksniffs. Exceptions
may be made in the case of Knapman
(Edmund Duggan), who is a conventionally
good stage butler, and Harry Tavender
(Edwin Brett), who is a clever and arrest-
ing study in blundering well-meaningness,
with undeniable personality of his own. But
otherwise the play has a tendency to drag
when Lawrence Grossmith, as the delightful
Sir Joseph isn’t before the footlights.
This is particularly noticeable in the early
part of the last act.
* * * *
Grossmith, as the entangled and occasion-
ally indiscreet but never perturbed and
always resourceful Joseph, is as easy,
natural and telling as he always is. Miss
Doris Champion is an attractive and piquant

GRAND OPERA HOUSE.
Mrs. Drexel (May Beatty) pursuing Hum-
phrey (Mark Daly).
Lady Verona to whom, one would say,
coquetry comes more naturally than inten-
sity of feeling. Miss Mabel Gower plays her
very minor part capably. Miss Dorothy
Seacombe, as Mrs. Tavender, the mischief-
making woman who rather nrides herself on
her discretion, looks reasonably convincing,
albeit it is not altogether clear why she should
roll her eyes from side to side so persistently.
As Hardolph Mayne, the injured husband,
who eventually discovers that his hurts are
imaginary, Ashton Jarry is torn with an-
guish in a rather macliine-like way. Roger
Barry, as Gerald Fanmere, and Leslie Vic-
tor, as Jermyn Pyecroft, throw plenty of
spirit into their portraiture of utterly far-
cical characters; the former's intonation
might be clearer. The blame for the egre-
gious grotesqueness of Professor Tofield
should obviously be the portion of the play-
wright, not of Winnington Barnes. The
play is well produced, the scenic require-
ments being of the slightest.
The Playbox Society, a group of drama
enthusiasts, under the leadership of Duncan
Macdougall, presented Eugene O’Neill’s
“Hairy Ape” to an overflow house at St.
James’s, Sydney, on Monday night. It was
one of the most ambitious productions Syd-
ney has ever seen; and the stage and the
lighting failed to cope with the tremendous
scenes. Yet the work of Macdougall, as
Yank, the “hairy ape,” more than justified
the production. Besides, the play is the
thing; and here we have the attempt of the
underdog, “without any past, and with no
future,” to puzzle out the unequal game of
life. What disastrous results that thinking
may have on the steel girders of capitalism
and the ruling classes is brutally suggested
by O’Neill’s masterpiece. Incidentally, the
Victorian convention that soliloquies are bad
craftsmanship is smashed to smithereens.
The find of the S.U.D.S., John Gould, who
took The Bulletin’s eye and ear on his
first public performance, was highly effective
as the old Irish sailorman Paddy. The next
performance of the little company will be on
November 22.
“Iris” has. only eight more nights to run
at Sydney Theatre Royal. On Saturday
week the massive and conscientious Oscar
Asche will cast off the trappings of Pinero’s
South American millionaire and endeavor to
compress himself into the limits of Shaks-
peare’s Othello.
** * *
“A Southern Maid” continues to deliver
the goods at Her Majesty’s, Sydney; the play
might almost be described as “a beaker full
of the warm South.” Gladys Moncrieff with
the lustrous eyes is singing more commend-
ably than ever. And when Gladys is rest-
ing Cecil Bradley takes the part, and at
one matinee last week did more than well.
On- the other hand, somebody will really have
to mention to Chisholm that he occasionally
sings flat.

At Sydney Opera House “The O’Brien
Girl” basks in her ninth week of pdpular
favor, and Mamie Watson’s return to the
cast has given the gods a chance for an extra
demonstration of delight.
Will Evans, allegedly popular on the
boards of the Old Country, is being given
the once-over by Sydney Tivoli regulars.
The imported jester strikes this page as
being sadly in need of a self-starter. The
first 10 minutes of his turn, “Harnessing a
Horse,” is as dry as chaff, and the house
only begins to laugh when Bill trips over
the shafts of a cart or is pursued by the
prop” horse. And there is little subtle
artistry about that. However, William has
other starters in his stable, and probably
they will suit us better. An acceptable lady
is contralto Clare Solly, who keeps both her
voice and her audience under complete con-
trol.
Sydney’s newest variety show :
Gayfield Shaw’s yearly exhibition of “color notes
and sketches,” in his quaint little gallery perched on
top of Callaghan House, in George-street, is a joy
to the small buyer. About three dozen painters are
represented, including many of our most-talked-of
colorists, and there’s not a picture priced above 10
guineas. There are four taking bits by Hayley
Lever, R.8.A., the best being “River Thames, Chel-
sea,” and Harold Herbert, just back from Europe,
shows some craftsmanlike work done over there. I!.
E. Minns’s “Teamsters’ Camp,” with its smoke haze
hanging about the timber, is an effective little thing,
and Herbert Gallop strikes a fairly true note in
“Sunlit Pine Trees.” The three Lindsays, Percy
Leason, Blamire Young, Jackson, Erik Lancker,
Fullwood, Tristram and Dora Wilson all have f.a.q.
samples on view; and two of the most interesting
exhibitors are Maud Sherwood, with a couple of
strongly drawn and confidently colored studies, and
16-year-old H. W'eeks, with a landscape in which his
sense of color and freedom of handling suggest good
things to come.
Five weeks of Doone started at Melbourne
Princess’s last Saturday with “The Wear-
ing of the Green,” an artless tale of love
and complications wherein the hero dresses

to suit the title. He wears green clothes,
including overcoat to match, as well as his
familiar green manner, and he eventually
sings the old ditty which now sounds rather
uncalled for. In the plans of its easy-going
villain (Ronald Riley), and the thwartings
of Allen Doone (who ranks as the most
glorious singer in all Ould Oireland) and the
sighings of Miss Keeley (who supports an
aged father by her paint brush), “The Wear-
ing of the Green” is almost the softest of
Doone’s productions. Considered as a harm-
less drink for crude intellects it may be
termed the mildest shandygaff of melodrama.
It is to be followed in due course by “Sweet
County Kerry” and other gems of the Doone
repertoire.
** * *
The authors of the farcical comedy at
Melbourne Palace Theatre gave it a great
start in life with a title to suit all tastes.
“Tons of Money” compels a certain amount
of attention. Presumably the title was an
inspired afterthought, seeing that the wild
comedy is concerned with the impecuniosity
of a young married couple whose windfall
of wealth will only suffice to pay their debts
up to date. But, however it got there, “Tons
of Money” is a, title for wiser and better
farces to envy; and Dorothy Brunton’s
hearty co-operation in making “the farce of
a thousand laughs” a success can be confi-
dently relied upon.

malion” four nights and a matinee this week
in aid of mixed charities. On Saturday
comes a revival of “De Luxe Annie,” with
Emelie Polini and Frank Harvey at the
head of affairs.
At Melbourne Royal Sally continues to wash
the dishes at a restaurant previous to witching
the customers with her wondrous dancing.
At Melbourne Playhouse, where Allan
Wilkie has ceased to Shakspeare, a week of
“Madame Angot” commences next Monday.
The Vic. Opera Co., which Hanstein con-
ducts. will restore this fine French classic to
the Melbourne stage. Young persons un-
acquainted with the best opera-bouffe of 50
years ago are advised to make sure and add
it to their education.
The Mermaid Repertory Society is doing
its last dash for the present at Melbourne
Playhouse. On Friday and Saturday this
week the Mermaids will present, for the
first time in Australia, a comedy by a Span-
ish author. “The Romantic Young Lady,” pre-
ceded by “The Home Coming,” of local origin.
Melbourne loses the Circus after to-night
(Thursday). There is a certain sadness in
the fact. The Wirths’ show marks the come
and go of seasons, bringing every year a pro-
mise of merry sunshine (which is rarely
fulfilled) as well as a certainty of racing boom,
and departing when the first hint of Christ-
mas begins to redden the horizon. ( For a
whole year thereafter Melbourne is either a
child waiting for the next circus, or a grown-
up wondering at the flight of time.

The week’s thriller at Hoyt’s, in Mel-
bourne, “The Children of Jazz,” depicts
jaZz-crazed flapper and a male partner lil
crime being whirled along the downward
path with Unlimited cocktails, cigarettes,
glad eyes and other destroyers of in-no-cence.
Their hectic career is luckily checked by a
hydroplane, which hurtles them into the brain-
cooling atmosphere of an early-Victorian
household, where the strong, silent hero sub-
dues the giddy jazzers until they eat Out of
his hand. At the Majestic crowded houses
divide their weeps and chortles between
“The Poor Relation” and a thrilling circus
yarn, one-half of which has been “shot”
Under the canvas and the other in the back-
woods. An elephant, whose sagacity (out-
paces that of any previously featured animal,
is the hero of the situation.
** * *
“De Luxe Annie,” as revived at Adelaide
Royal, is specially notable for the compara-
tive failure of a good man. Frank Harvey
is always delightful, but he is not nearly the
realisation of the little crook that John
Fernside was when it was played before.
Emelie Polini is brilliant as the Sub-
conscious heroine. But she breaks that in-
exorable law for emotional actresses, “Don’t
Jnake a noise when you cry,” and her noisy
grief gets the wrong response from an aver-
age audience. Maurice Dudley repeats his
old success in a small part, and the support
is good. The Majestic has outstayed its
various rivals in the variety business, and
relies on a good bill in which Mello and
Nello are a strong point. The tenor Coscio
is just coming in. In pictures, York and
Wondergraph are very melodramatic and sen-
timental —Ethel Dell stuff, pure or Ameri-
canised—but promise better things for the
immediate future. West’s has a powerful
picture with the catchpenny name “The
“THE BEGGAR’S OPERA,” AT MEL-
BOURNE HER MAJESTY’S.
Charles Mettam as Filch, Reginald Roberts
as the Beggar, Victor Prince as Lockit.
Town that Forgot God,” and Tom Mix at
the Pav. is super-active in “Catch My
Smoke.” Also, the Melbourne Cup naturally
goes well on any screen.
The show that The Bulletin has been
most interested in this week has been staged
before the N.S.W. Full Court (the Chief
Justice and Justices Gordon and James).
Scott Fell, thought that this paper
should not have commented on the verdict of
the jury which recently ordered him and
the Commonwealth Government to pay the
Limerick S. S. Co. nearly £20,000 and costs.
He applied for and got a rule nisi calling on
this paper to show cause why it should
not be attached for contempt. On Tuesday
afternoon the rule was discharged. The
matter in dispute was as to the right of a paper
to say anything about a matter upon which
a jury has spoken if notice of appeal has
been given. The English Courts have laid
it down a dozen times that within certain
limits comment is quite permissible; and the
N.S.W. Full Court has done Australian news-
papers the good service of making it clear
that the same salutary rule applies here. Mr.
Scott Fell, therefore, pays the costs, both
in The Bulletin case and in one in which
Smith’s Weekly w r as the respondent. Inci-
dentally, something has been said about a
Bulletin attack on the Chief Justice. This
paper never made one. It has the very
highest regard for his Honor’s character: no
man’s stands higher in this paper’s estimation.

HIS FAME.
UNEXPECTED CALLER: "Ah how charming!
I have heard so much of your pot-
hoiling, and now I have caught you in
the act.”
“Makira”: Some people complain that
Oscar Aselie gives his public too much for
their money in the matter of avoirdupois, but
at any rate the whole theatre can hear him
without straining tlieir tympanums. I wish
other actors were equally conscious of the
fact that people sitting further back than
Row D are entitled to hear the joke. I
went to see “Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife” at
Sydney Criterion, and most of the mummers
might as well have been in the movies for
all I heard of their remarks —and I wasn’t
near the back door, either. Mayne Lynton,
who barks his lines as though he were a
machine-gun, was the only member of the
short cast who was intelligible all through.
“0.K.”: Sydney Repertory Society, with
the social influence of Mrs. Pitt Rivers be-
hind it, has queered the pitch of Melbourne’s
Mermaid Repertory Society at a time when
the Mermaids might have looked for good
receipts. They intended to play a week of
revivals from Nov. 12 to 17, in addition
to the first production of "The Romantic
Young Lady.” Mrs. Pitt Rivers was to
have been invited to play the heroine. But
the lady had arranged to star in “Pyg-
malion” at a J.C.W. theatre in Melbourne,
the Sydney Rep. Co. coming over to sup-
port her at the very time when the Mel-
bourne Society proposed to run its show at
the Playhouse. The Mermaids, therefore,
gave place to the invaders, and reduced their
programme to two nights of “The Romantic
Young Lady," with Mrs. Apperly in the
name-part. These will happen at the Play-
house on 16th and 17th inst.. and will be
in the nature of a send-off to Mrs. Apperly,
the enthusiast who serves the Mermaid
Society as honorary producer. She is taking
a six months’ holiday.
“Bloggs” : “Who’s Who" betrays that Ger-
trude Elliott married Johnston Forbes-
Robertson 23 years ago. Yet watching her
from a front stall in “Bluebeard’s Eighth
Wife” the other night I could detect but
one sign or symptom that she is out of her
twenties. Her face, figure and hair are
those of a pretty girl, but—she keeps her
feet still. In the ’nineties the laws govern-
ing deportment still' lingered. Well-bred
maidens kept their feet together and their
arms at their sides, and showed as little
leg as possible. If Gertrude Elliott would
only forget her girlish training and take to
dashing her feet about, tieing her legs in
knots when seated, and hitching up her
skirts at every opportunity, she might pass
as a modern flapper in any company.
“Minim” : Learned professors, I read, are
discussing the origin of the melody of “Yes,
We Have,” etc., the latest American atrocity.
What melody there is is palpably cribbed,
not from the old masters, as is humorously
suggested, but from the more modern “I
Dreamt that I Dwelt in Marble Halls.” Eight
bars of Wallace’s air are jazzed, one-stepped,
or otherwise monkeyed with, but not a note
is altered.
“T.”: Starved by the J. C. Williamson
firm and satiated with pitchers, Perth
(W.A.) resolved years ago to furnish some
theatrical fare of its own. Among other
things it organised a Concert Artists’
Society, which has grown into about the
biggest affair of its kind in the Common-
wealth. Its productions generally run a
fortnight, and that means an attendance of
about 20,000, for Molloy’s theatre takes fill-
ing. Latest on the boards was “The Runaway
Girl,” with the usual 60 society damsels in
the chorus. Also, there is a Repertory
Society, which introduces reigning or recent
London successes, the latest being “The
Young Person in Pink.” It is an oddly-
casted comedy, with eight ladies and two
gents. One of the latter is a mere bird of
passage. The other gets all the limelight
and the lip-drill, and there is not a little of
that.
“Orb”: Allan Wilkie’s simple setting is
in strongly marked contrast with other “Mid-
summer Night’s Dreams” we have had in
Australia. Seeing Wilkie in the grotesque
ass’s head as Bottom, I was reminded of
George Rignold’s remarkable illusion. With
an immense sheet of plate-glass between him
and the audience, Rignold went to sleep on
the bank, and, as the lights w T ere slowly
checked, his double, reclining in the cellar-
age beneath the stage, was reflected in the
glass which had become a mirror as the
lights behind it were lowered. It was really
the Pepper’s Ghost illusion. Then Rignold
would remove the huge ass’s head from his
own, and command his dresser to “take this
blanky thing away and bring me a whisky-
and-soda.”
“F.A.”; Alfred Hill, who is doing the
music for Hugh McCrae’s “Ship of Heaven,”
lias hitherto had poor luck with his libret-
tists. His “Tapu,” produced a decade and
a half ago by the J. C. Williamson firm,
contained many tuneful numbers, but the
dialogue was as dull as a Dunedin Sunday
night. “The Moorish Maid” was good music
married to an inferior “book.” and marred
by the nascent craze for the Yankee vaude-
ville conglomerations styled musical comedies.
“The Maid” was last played in 1912. It ran
for a week at Sydney Repertory Theatre with
a mixed cast of amateurs and pros.
“The Deacon”: Mention by “Pollardian”
(B. l/11/’23) of how May Beatty stepped
into the name-part of “Falka” at Auckland
(M.L.) when Marion Mitchell lost her voice,
recalls how well Marion has done for herself.
Ernest Davis, the wealthy Auckland brewer,
swept her out of Pollards’ co., and now
Marion divides her time between Britain
and the Continong. When I met her a while
back she had forgotten Pollards and her £l4
per week, and could say “Haw” with the
best of the Beerage.
“Herodot”: In the old mining days some
of. the theatres in towns noted for their bois-
terous audiences were equipped with drop-
curtains made of wire-netting. At the first
sign of danger the carrot-catcher would be
lowered, and, contemptuous of the baffled
populace, the company would continue to do
its worst. Some of these curtains protected
actor-rs against the caprices of the unreason-
ing multitude until comparatively recent
times. One is preserved among the old junk
of a hall at Castlemaine (Vic.) —or was
when I saw it.
“G.A.C.” : Milne’s “Belinda” hasn’t pleased
some of the Melbourne critics. This sur-
prises me rather, for I helped some amateurs
to murder it- in Maoriland once, and we
never tired of the bubbling little comedy. It
is frankly incredible, of course, but Belinda
herself is such a refreshing bit of fluff that
you can forgive the rest anything. Milne is
second only to Barrie as a master of stage
directions, and his little asides to the actors
are as clever as anything they say. When
Belinda leaves the stage at the end of the
first act, he tells you that “the abandoned
woman goes in to tea,” although the audience
does not hear it; and when she returns at
the beginning of the second, the direction is
“Enter Belinda, in a hat.” If a play can
keep its performers laughing over three
months of rehearsals, there must be some
merit in it, surely.
THE GREATER WRONG.
“What's eat in ’ you note, Vera?”
“Pm not yetting a fair shore in this company, that’s all”
“Oh, cheer up, girlie—think of what the public is getting.”
From Moses Baritz in England
I have been digging up some facts about Wallace
the composer, subject of a recent Bulletin con-
troversy. Brought up a Protestant (he was organist
for a time at Thurles Cathedral), he turned R.C. in
order to marry Isabella Kelly. With Isabella, her
sister and his own sister he left Dublin! for Sydney
in the early part of 1835, being threatened, it was
thought, with consumption. During the voyage he
recovered sufficiently to flirt enthusiastically with
Miss Kelly, and, infuriated by his wife’s reproaches,
he swore he would leave her when they reached Aus-
tralia. Grove, of the “Musical Dictionary,” states
that the party arrived in Sydney on St. Patrick’s
Day, 1836, and that Wallace “transferred his house-
hold to the bush, far to the west of Sydney.” My
information is that he incontinently left his wife,
and never saw her again. How long he remained
in N. S. Wales is not known by the authorities I
have consulted at this end, but there is a tradition
that he went to Tasmania and afterwards to Maori-
land, where he took part in a whaling expedition.
Some good musician might profitably trace Wallace’s
Australian career. Maybe the Mitchell Library can
tell us something. The British Museum catalogue
contains over 100 pages of Wallace’s compositions
and transcriptions, but it is impossible to find out
here how much or how little of the music was com-
mitted to paper in Australia.
“Jacky Roo”: “Zeus” (B. 8/11/’23) is
mistaken when he says that the habit of
lining-up after every scene has become obso-
lete in British theatres. I can’t recall one
London show in which the leading people
didn’t stand in an absurd group between acts.
It is an inane idea, but aetor-rs are vain
creatures, and journalists feed their vanity.
“Second Murderer” : I am with “Zeus” in
objecting to these ridiculous curtain-calls.
One can forgive a Little Willie, who may
have to die in Act. 1, waiting around
patiently till the end of Act 5 to receive the
box of chocolates which Aunt Jemima has
handed in for delivery over the foots; but
grown people should have a better sense of
proportion. Once at Sydney Royal Gaston
Mervale, playing in “Trilby,” refused to
come to life again as Svengali to oblige an
audience which nearly whistled the roof off.
The papers all praised his “artistic re-
straint.” and so on. But he couldn’t keep it
up, and on succeeding nights he spoilt it all
by reappearing in the silly old way.
“Caesar’s Gliost” : Exaggeration of salaries
is an old theatrical foolishness. An actor
wanted for a small touring venture m
N.S.W. demanded £2O a week. “Never, he
thundered, “shall my name go on a salary-
sheet at less than that tiguali." And then he
added in a whisper: “But all I’ll expect to
get is” —a sum so low that it would have
shocked the showman if that person had had
a heart and a conscience. I was the show-
man.
“Shay” : Talking of Pollard’s Eilliputians.
A well-meaning parson called at a hotel
where they were staying, and asked it lie
might have a talk with “the deah little boys.
One of the “girls” told him briskly he would
have to wait, because they were “away at
the barber’s gettin’ shaved.”
“Thersites”: Brian Darley (B. 11/10/’23)
was a great idol of the gallery girls—though
“gallery girls” were to be found only in the
stalls and d.c in those days. Darley made his
first bow in Australia in ’B4 at Melb. Opera
House, lie was Mercutio in Bignold’s won-
derful production
of “Romeo and
Juliet.” Bob In-
man made his first
Australian appear-
an c e the same
night, as Benvolio,
and he has been
mumming in Aus-
tralia ever since.
Harley was a strik-
ing 1 y handsome
man; indeed, his
Adonis-like charms
got him into a once-
celebrated divorce
case.
“Jacky Roo”:
Mulcaster, a good
actor and a shrewd
critic, wondered
why so few Brit-
ish pictures were
to be seen in Aus-
tralia. The “ex-
planation” of those
who thrive on the
American m o n-
opoly -is that the
English can’t make
moving - pictures.
“Mord Em’ly” is a
good answer to
that gibe. It is
miles better than
Ma r y Bickford’s
Cockney film
“Suds,” photo-
graphed at Holly-
wood, and one of
the dreariest shows
I ever sat through.
“Mord” is the real
thing played by
the real people. In it
Betty Balfour, stu-
pidly billed as “England's Mary Bickford,”
contrived to point the wearisome artificiality
of Mary’s box of tricks when contrasted with
the work of a real actress.
“Quarter-sheet” : Frank Smith (8.8/11/’23)
kept two Burrangong Hotels in Sydney. The
first stuck out in the street where the Sav-
ings Bank now stands at the corner of Hay
and George streets. For years it was chained
(literally) to the adjoining building. It fell
down one night, and Frank changed his venue
to the hotel up the street, on the same side,
opposite the Alhambra.
“Flyman”; Returning to Sydney after a
long absence I spent many hours at what
used to be Poverty Point, corner of King
and Castlereagh streets, in hopes of seeing
some of the old greasepaint gang. Never got
a yarn or even a “bite.” But happening
along to the corner of Castlereagh and Park
streets, I discovered they were still “biting.”
The Pointers have changed their quarters,
but not their habits.
“T. 0.1.”; Barry Sullivan (B. 8/11/’23)
lies under a remarkable monument in
Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin—a statue of the
actor as Hamlet holding Yorick’s skull. The
sculptor was Thomas Farrell, and the cost,
raised by public subscription, £5OO. Sulli-
van died May 3, 1891, at Hove (Eng.), aged
67. While in Melbourne he sought out the
grave in Kew y Cemetery of his early friend
Edward Wliitty, a Liverpool journalist who
came to Melbourne in ill health and died
soon after. Sullivan raised a monument
over the grave, as did G. V. Brooke some
years earlier over the resting-place in Gee-
long Cemetery of Nesbitt McCron, a fint
actor who died young.
TOM TUCKERS. OF THE WILD.
[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Miss Lily Butler, known to soldiers during the
war as ‘Mother of Blighty,’ told the London Weekly
Despatch (16/9/’23)' that while staying overnight
at a telegraph station near Charlotte Waters in
Central Australia she had the alarming experience
of being serenaded by a tribe of cannibals who oniy
two years before had killed and eaten the two station
operators.”
“Waits” may be a nuisance in England, I’ve found,
When you’re snug in your bedroom apparel,
And well-meaning minstrels come barging- around
To waken you up with a volume of sound
That you dimly suspect is a carol.
But they mean you no harm, hence annoyance’s pang
Is brief. But it must have been mighty
Perturbing that night when a cannibal gang
Satirical lullabies hungrily sang
To the lady whose fame over battlefields rang
As “Mother of Blighty.”
Of the musical items no mention is made
Or whether tin dishes were beaten,
But one gets an idea, in that grim serenade
At the Back o’ Beyond, that the instruments played
Were the bones of the clerks wlio’d been eaten.
Did they strum out a variant on “England’s Roast
Beef” ?
Did a melody, haunting and flighty,
Through the desert vibrate as the cannibal chief
In basso-profundo asserted his grief
That he couldn’t remain for a meal —though he’d
lief —
With “Mother of Blighty” ?
Ye gentles of England, and ladies as: well,
Who deem it a trial inter alia
At the season of Yule when the peals of a bell
Or scraps from the hymnal your slumbers dispel,
What a far tougher spin might be yours did you
dwell
In Miss Lily Butler’s Australia.
When into their nocturnes the savages break
Full many a man in his ’jamas will shake
And many a woman will quiver and quake
In her filmy and frill-bedecked nightie.
Like troubadours might, they will sing you awake ;
In their notes is a passionate yearning, an ache
For what most they desire—no doubt ’twas a steak
Of “Mother of Blighty,”
n.s.w.

So I said, “Don’t you think lie is funny?”
He answered, “A scream! He’s a quaint bird, and

And he’s ‘playing to me,’ so I can’t laugh outright.
Or the terms he would quote me would give me a

He’d want double his usual money!”

How the Wendells Bought
tS j
n '■ill a
The Wendells live in that
delightful home at the end of
Elm Street. They are one of
those happy, companionable
families we all admire.
—and they've just bought a
car.
Naturally, their car must completely
satisfy the individual preferences of each
member of the family, for Ruth and Bob
are just home from college.
To Ruth Wendell, in the bloom of life,
the car must be distinctively different.
One in which she is proud to be seen.
One in which every consideration is given
to all that she herself would have placed
there.
To Mrs. Wendell comfort is a first
requisite. She wants deep, downy
upholstery inviting roominess easy
riding qualities and every refinement
essential to a really fine motor car.
To Bob, a strapping young man with a
hunger for power and speed, the car for
him must have dash and be a living,
breathing thing with a quick pickup
stylish individual in coloring
strikingly distinctive.
To Mr. Wendell, shrewd business man
that he is, the choice must first of all be
a good investment—dependable—durable
—with high mileage on petrol and tyres —-
and low upkeep.
In the car of the famous proven units he
not only found the fulfillment of his own
requirements, but those of every member
of the family.
—the Wendells bought a MOON.

MR. OSCAR ASCHE &
The 'Beale Reproducer
WM. i »6j
doz NEW HAMPTON COURT
SMessrs. c ßeale & Co. Ltd.,
It is impossible to express in mere ■words my ap-
preciation of your wonderful reproducing piano.
As I listen to the rolls played by such great artists
as Busoni, Levitski, Greig, and others whom I
have had the honour of meeting and hearing, I
close my eyes and imagine it is not a mechanical
reproducer I am listening to, but to the great per-
formers in flesh and blood, so faithfully is every
mannerism of technique, shall one say, photo-
graphed. oAnd the tone of the instrument is
unequalled by any I have heard.
Truly the Teale is the final step, for it is a ioo
per cent, reflection of a pianist's efforts.

A Player-Piano
for £l9B
(f.o.b. Sydney)
See the New Beale f< Five-
Three”Player-Pia.no. This
is the instrument that has
created new standards in
player-piano values. En-
dorsed by eminent authori-
ties as an instrument of
superb, artistic merit. Has
genuine ivory keyboard,
silver-steel strings, genuine
Mahogany casework, finest
spruce sound-board, etc. A
quality production throughout
Sold on very easy terms.
,0 properly understand Mr. Asche’s letter
it is necessary to know that the New Beale
Reproducer is NOT a player-piano.
Every yZ)/czyer-piano requires to be intelli-
gently controlled by an operator - someone who will
give the music the depth of feeling it should have.
The Beale Reproducer requires no operator. It is
electrically controlled and, from special ''recordings I ,’
reproduces the playing of nearly every famous pian-
ist in the world. In touch, tone and temperament,
these recordings are exact reproductions of the pianists’
effects—hence the name "reproducer piano.”
Mr. Asche’s letter is doubly interesting from the fact that the
playing of many artists whom he has heard personally was faith-
fully reproduced by this wonderful, new instrument.

of riding- to do. it has pads quite different in shape and position to
the orthodox stock saddle, and these lie .along the rider’s thighs,
giving the utmost security and yet plenty of freedom. The
flaps are sewn direct on to the seat, without the usual skirt,

the stockman. It is high-grade throughout in workmanship

Betterave: And another man once wrote
to Bedford telling him that in a story of the Indian
Ocean he had put in one wave too many... .His-
trionieus: By the same mail came a letter from
the people most interested, giving thanks for the
space devoted to them.... J. 0.: Too much talk and
too little point.... Mudlark: Both questions were
discussed some time ago J.A.A.V.: Yes, but
what’s all the trouble about?... .Midas: “Pirate
Ship” is good enough verse, but rather too much
like a catalogue of old “properties” G.A.C.: The
spirit is willing to admit “Human Document,” but
the space is weak.... Prretor: Muddy in thought and
cloudy in language. .. .Hayseed: You don’t make any-
thing of it.... Penelope: Hardly L. A. (Samarai) :
Not very much in it B.M. (Orookwell) : Doesn’t
hit us hard enough I.R. (Leichhardt): They tread
j well-worn ground a bit too heavily 8.V.E.:
! There was a point, but you’ve lost it in the hand-
ling. . . ..Timmy P.: Very poor verse Lucy D.: You
dou t make good use of your materials.... F.M.
i (East Brisbane): The yarn doesn’t look believable.
....Hilda E.: The horse verse goes too heavily....
11.M.t.: It is too commonplace and thin in feeling
i after all that has been written on the same subject.
.... It.L.W.: You don’t give it any interest. .'. .A.D.S.:
Not up to the mark.,.. J.Ti. (Helensburgh): It’s
wild enough to startle even a well-trained liar; but
it doesn’t thrill Generalf: A little too obviously
manufactured.... itipponlea > Sing on, sweet minstrel:
Missus Allan had rheumatics,
Also Saint Vitus acrobatics,
And had her hack rubbed with a lemon
Like th’ very demon.
Son Tom came in and put up th’ plow
; And noble hacks, and mopped his brow.
He oft would have a lemon-squash
Which oft relieved him very much,
And made him feel delightfully ■fresh.
But alas lie was a trifle rash,
Because he’d used a second-hand fruit
To whet his tired and aching throat.
....Irene W.: You use phrases without considering
whether they mean anything. .. .Jendi: One still has
a chance E-.M.F. : A bit too young. .. .1.F.M.:
“A Memory” is a very good portrait of a camel —
all rags and lumps. .. .E.E.8.: It falls over a gram-
matical hurdle in the first stanza.... Chan: The
verses are weak and girlish, but you look ,as though
you might do better.... Geoffrey R.: Not enough
there for a yarn. .: .G.P. (South Brisbane): No use
to us D.11.R.: “Jim,” is too colorless.... M.M.
(Bellevue Hill) : Good work wasted on a succession
of unlikely horrors D.P.J.: No good P.J.R.:
Commonplace thought in leaden verse... .Mary F.:
You don’t take the trouble to even make it look as
if it meant something. ... A. D.M.: The idea is weary
with, age. .. .Mombak : You show a fine sympathy
with nature:- —
Said the bug to the flea
Come listen to me,
This place is rotten to live in ;
There’s a girl in this house
(I got this from the louse)
When she sees one of us puts a pin in.
To the bug said the flea,
You’re not worse than me,
For when on the dog I frolic,
Up comes a man
And in his hand
A bottle full of ' cqrboljc.
Then up spoke the louse,
The missus had a rouse
At the girl with the rosy lips,
And then at the end
Asked a neighbor to lend
A handful of quassia chips.
. ...H.IT.H.: None of them gets near. . . .L.F.E,:
It left us pretty sleepy.... P. A.K.: You call it a
“poem” and ask for criticism. Well, frankly, it i*
bad prose without interest for man or beast....
P.J.D.: Your “sin” is wearisome. .. .Spadger: Verily
the Scriptures did not undervalue you. .. .W.M.F.:
Far too slight... .James F.: It doesn’t fit u 5....
T.A.C.: The idea is not new and the verse is not
good. . . . D.S. (Tas.) : The point is small and blunt.
. ...W.L.N.: You couldn’t have said much less about
the animal nor said it much worse... .G.R. (Melb.) :
A miracle of emptiness. .. .Ben Sun: The ideas can t
get through in verse as poor as that... . J.A.E.: Not
convincing. .. .C.0.M.: A sonnet must be better than
that.... Curlew: Too spun-out for the point... .S.M.
(Devonport) : Dull matter and poor writing. .. .
Punter: Why did you get a drunk blow-fly to write
it for you ‘1.... Margaret A.: But the winds don’t
whisper anything E.N.H.: Album verse that little
Maudie might write to please her Auntie Jane....
D.J.M.: If they make a noise like that in your
“Earthly Paradise” and call it verse, the angels
must be working a swindle. . .. J.P. (Barmera) : Does
not get a hint of the feeling... .H.J.G.: There’s
a suggestion of mirth, but it often falls by the
wayside... .D.S.H.: Cold and conventional... .F.J.F.:
Ycu don’t quite manage to do what you are trying
for. Give it some more attention... .Nimshi: As
English verse they are poor. Lyrics won’t trans-
late; fjid writing “Exquisite!” against things that
are not doesn’t help much.... J.J.S.: If we could
print a little more, “Man of Action” would be
included... .V.T.: Mostly good. But there are a
few lines whose meaning has to be guessed at... .
Imprint: Is it a puzzle or a poem? Jendi: Smart;
hut it ought to be neater... .S.C.C.: Of course such
yarns have to be manufactured; the art of it is to
hide the marks of the machine... .L.S. (Linton) : Well
done; but another got in first.... P.W.W.-: It creaks
in all its joints. See if you can’t make it a, little
less stiff.... Pharisee: You use your flail too wildly.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
L.P.: Some promise; you might be able to place
it elsewhere... .J.S.C.M.: Criticism could get no fur-
ther than the mourner’s headgear. ... H.C.: Crude
drawing G.F.A.: Left at the barrier C.F.H.:
You have ingeniously crammed into them every fault
that was ever invented... ..I. S.: Just two heads have
to be very distinctive to get through... .K.L.L.: Turn
your misguided feet away from Art forever....
Rufus: Still out in the wilderness.... G.M.: Too
close to an old gag T.R.F.: Even if up to the
mark it would be too microscopic—all sketches are
drawn much larger than they are published.... J. 8.:
If this fails you’ll “try no move”! Alas, farewell!
“Ex-Dig.” : The Randwick (Sydney) Mili-
tary Hospital will close down as soon as
the State (which wants it for a home for
weak-minded children) and the Common-
wealth can agree upon terms. The build-
ings, originally an orphanage, became a mili-
tary hospital when the war started. The
llepat.., which controls the place, has found
it can get medical attention for ex-soldiers
cheaper by paying for it in general hospi-
tals, and for some time Randwick has re-
ceived only a proportion of the war-invalids.
The Commonwealth is asking £BO,OOO for
the premises, and of course the State Gov-
vernment wants it for a lot less.

he last thousand miles
are the hardest
ALMOST any tyre looks good in the
dealer’s display rack. Almost any
tyre continues to look good the
first few hundred miles of use.
But as the hundreds of miles pile up into
the thousands, and the thousands pile
up too, the truth comes surely forth.
For a tyre, the last few thousand miles
are the hardest.
The last few thousand miles in a Good-
year Tyre are as a rule quite outside the
reach and ability of the ordinary tyre.
They are extra miles—miles given the
user by the extra quality built into
the Goodyear product.
For the largest single group of tyre-
buyers in the world, these extra miles
constitute the final reason for preferring
Goodyear equipment.
They underlie the well-earned reputa-
tion of Goodyear Tyres as the most satis-
factory and economical tyres you can
buy.
In the new Goodyear Cord Tyre with
the bevelled All-Weather Tread this
characteristic of Goodyear performance
is given even larger emphasis.
Every feature, every improvement in
this new tyre is calculated to insure
greater mileage, greater freedom from
trouble, greater economy.
The improved rubber compound in the
tread, the heavier sidewalls, the stouter
ply-unions, the bevelled tread feature —
all contribute to make this the finest tyre
Goodyear ever produced.
In actual service on thousands of motor-
cars it is daily establishing new records
for low-cost performance.
When you buy a new tyre look beyond
the dealer’s display rack to those im-
portant last few thousand miles.
If the tyre you buy is the new Goodyear
Cord with the bevelled All-Weather
Tread, you are assured that those last
few thousand miles will crown a per-
formance in every way satisfactory.

purposes , Asbestos Sheet Packing and Rubber Heels .

Insects
How to destroy them
Diseased, Plague-infested
insects are a positive
menace, and should be
ruthlessly destroyed by
using
Kruses
Insecticide
Insects of every species are“down
and out” the moment this mar-
vellous exterminator is applied.
Kruse’s Insecticide positively kills
Fleas, Ants, Bugs, Flies, Cock-
roaches, Mosquitoes, Moths, etc.;
yet is positively harmless in its
application to Dogs, Cats, Poultry,
etc., etc.
For the destruction of Aphis,
Woodlice, and other plant-attack-
ing insects, a light sprinkling of
Kruse’s Insecticide in still weather
is all that is necessary.

“Sir Spen”: One of the unkindest cuts the
horse family has had for many years was
handed out at Huglienden (Q.) the other
day when 400 prads of mixed ages were sold
at auction for £l.
* * * *
"Jackeroo”: The Pittsworth Dairy Co.
(Q.) has just manufactured a sizeable
cheese. Over a ton and a half of curd weut
into a specially-prepared mould; and as the
infant is too big to pass through the rail-
way tunnels it will have to go dow r n to Bris-
bane by road. After remaining in cold
storage at Brisbane for a few months it will
be towed to the Empire Exhibition.
* * Mr #
“O. Giddout” : I was a weekly subscriber
to Tatt.’s till I drew a £lO prize and re-
ceived £8 14s. Then 1 did some thinking,
also some arithmetic. 1 was paying tis. 2d.
(including postage) for a live-bob ticket—
nearly 25 per cent, over the odds. Tatt.'s
got their cut before the consultation was
drawn. Then various Governments grabbed
approximately 17 per cent., and 1 got what
was left. If the sweep was run on the ordi-
nary co-operative principle I should have
received about £l3 10s. instead of £8 14s. 1
find the local pub flutter more attractive.
* * * *
“Mendelian"; Tell “Ringer” that more
than water at shallow depths (B. 25/10/’23)
is wanted for successful date-growing. The
grower needs to do a bit of “mating.” He
should keep only a few male trees—-and it
takes experience and skill to select these. In
the flowering season the male flowers must
be used to fertilise the female ones, by shak-
ing the pollen into them. It sounds easy;
but lots of these cultural processes require a
practised hand. Given the right conditions,
dates may be made to return over £ 1 Of J an
acre. I never heard of an Australian wheat-
paddock doing that in less than 20 years.
* * * *
“Randolph Rentless”: The 8. M. llekalu
may also be involved in an argument with
the City Council when its ancient barn Anally
disappears and the new offices reach com-
pletion on the corner that has long been one
of Sydney’s eyesores. Long ago the City
Council sought to acquire portion of the
Herald land in order to round off the cor-
ner. It offered £lOOO a foot, but the Fair-
faxes replied that if the land was handed
over it would be as a gift. Evidently the
family doesn’t see its way to make the gift,
for the plans of the new building make no
provision for the improvement the Council
wanted.
* » * *
“X2X”: Could not the Federal Govern-
ment arrange for the storing at central
points throughout the country districts of
anti-typhoid and diphtheritic sera ? Chemists
in small country towns cannot be expected
to stock sera, vaccines and antitoxins, for
which they are seldom asked, and which
inevitably deteriorate. Hence it often hap-
pens that an out-back doctor, with a case of
typhoid or diphtheria on his hands, has to
send to the city and wait perhaps four or
five days before something that may save a
life comes to hand. Large quantities of
sera are kept in the cities, mid at the Federal
Serum _ Institute in Melbourne, and these
might just as well be distributed as cen-
tralised.
* * » *
“Solentes”: “F. Clinton” (B. 25/10/’23)
is right when he estimates that mangrove
sticks at £2 a thousand, after being placed
on mud flats for oyster culture, may become
worth as much as Bd. per stick; but he does
not travel the whole distance. The sticks
are placed in pyramid formation on catch-
ment grounds near the entrances of the
estuaries, and when the young oysters or
“spat” adhering to the sticks are six to eight
months old, the supports are removed to
maturing grounds, say 10 miles up stream.
In the “sweet” water the growth is more
rapid than in the hard salt water near the
entrance, and 18 month's to two years on
the maturing grounds fits the oysters for
market. The bark of the black mangrove is
very brittle, hence the oysters are easily re-
moved. Incidentally, the sticks are of no
further use, having become barked in the
process of “culling” the oysters, and also
cobra-eaten while on the maturing grounds.
*■ * * *
“Buffalo,” from a hen-house:—
“Chanticleer's” neighbor (B. 18/10/’23), who
carried his swag on to his time-payment wilderness
and to-day has a poultry-farm worth £4OOO, is to
be congratulated on his pertinacity. But £4OOO
judiciously invested would return 8 p.c. interest —
£320. If you add to this even the lowest possible
equivalent for a poultry-farmer’s 70 hours a week
toil, say £5 a week, a yearly minimum income of
£5BO has to be shown to make the position of that
£4OOO farm even a fairly satisfactory one. If
“Chanticleer’s” neighbor can show that clear profit
of £5BO a year on his £4OOO farm, I’ll crawl into
the brooder house and give up the ghost. A man
can make a “living” with 600 hens; he can also
make one cracking stones by the wayside. If the
hen industry is the least precarious of any, as
“Chanticleer” asserts, then Heaven help the others.
Organisation to fight marketing battles is the first
thing needed ; after that the hen will have to put
her head down and her tail up and get a firm grip
on the flour-millers’ earlobe. The price of offal is
at the present moment the greatest obstacle to success.
* * * *
On Uncle Sam’s newest war:—
The Get-Rich-Quick Wallingfords of the U.S.A.
Pacific Coast have spoiled the pitch for Standard
Oil and their allies who used to rule the market
for motor-spirit. Over half the States the price
has got down to Bd. a gallon, and for a while
in some parts it was 6 id. The hundreds of
new wells in the neighborhood of Los Angeles have
done it. On the old fields they didn’t reckon there
ought to be more than one well to seven or eight
acres. In the oil country within 50 miles of Los
Angeles anybody’s back yard is big enough for a
claim: there are often three or four wells to an
acre. Buyers have simply bought a town block and
gone ahead. One result is that there isn’t room for
reservoirs, so the oil has to be put on the market
as it is produced—and there are wells that are
giving over 50,000 barrels a day. The outlay
isn’t heavy: 50,000 dollars will generally either
strike oil or prove the site a dud—and the pro-
portion of duds in this region is very small. The
immediate trouble is to find a market; and there
of course price-reduction helps. How long it will
last nobody knows; but the owners of the old
“slow” pumping wells further east are praying hard
that it won’t last long.

In the Restaurants and Ball Rooms of Sydney,
Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, you will always find
women who are well endowed with the feminine
graces—women who are admired for their beauty,
their comeliness and the elegance of their toilet.
Others again who claim an equal share of admiring
attention because they possess that elusive but
fascinating quality known as distinctive charm.
The beautiful woman, the comely woman and the
woman who has the charm of manner—the woman
who is well favoured with Nature’s greatest gifts and
the woman who, in her wisdom, snatches a grace
within the reach of art—one and all know by
feminine intuition the value of harmony in the clothes
they wear, in the colour schemes they favour, in the
character of the perfume that gives to their presence
an atmosphere of refinement and aesthetic ease.
Atkinson’s Californian Poppy series Perfumes
Complexion Cream, Powder, Soap, Shampoo
Powder, Talcum, Bath Salts, etc—are all delicately
fragranced with the same delightful essence.
If you make it your habit to use the full series, the
dainty bouquet of Californian Poppy will permeate
your wardrobe and you will experience the pleasure
that comes from harmony of toilet.

Hugh McKenzie, retired Vic. Customs
officer, passed his 87th milestone a few days
ago. He was in the Customs service in
Governor Hotham’s time, just on 70 years
ago.
A well-meaning will is that of James Day,
ot Adelaide, who lately left £13,000 and no
near relatives. Nearly all his money goes
for the benefit of S. Australians who went on
active service outside Australia during the
war, the president of the Returned Soldiers’
Assoc, being named as the person to make
the distribution.
“Sturt” : The Blue Funnel cargo steamer
Antomedon has made her first voyage to Aus-
tralia in record time for the round-the-Cape
route. She left Glasgow on September 22,
and reached Adelaide on October 26 —34
days; actual steaming time, 33 days 14
hours; average speed, 15 knots. The Cape-
town call was cut down to 10 hours, but
heavy weather was met with both before and
after that.
“G.R.” : The Edina, built 70 years ago in
Glasgow and still going strong, is now the
oldest steamer in Lloyd’s Register of Ship-
ping. The little packet does her 10
knots daily between Portarlington and Gee-
long. There can’t be much of the original
hull or machinery left, but there was good
workmanship on * the Clyde in the ’fifties,
and the Edina’s iron hull has outlasted the
more perishable steel of latter days.
“Womcrah” : The other week the N.S.W.
Education Department ordered all the chil-
dren who had completed the full course in
sixth class to face the barrier of the Permit
to Enrol examination. One of the “ques-
tions” was: “Describe the pioneers of Aus-
tralia and the backwoodsmen of America.”
Here is one of the pen-pictures that it
evolved :■ —
The pioneers of Australia are generally men with
beards like tufts of grass and are nearly always shown
in spurs and leggings and with a pipe in their
mouths. Their chief friend is a dog', which will
always mind the camp. The backwoodsmen of
America are much the same as the Australians, only
they smoke manure when they can’t get, tobacco.
Mrs. Fitzgerald, of Boowoogum (Q.), a
Sydney native, who died the other day after
having spent most of her 67 years in Wide
Bay district, had reason to know the perils
of lonely women in the bush. Once, during
her husband’s absence, she, with a few-
months-old infant in her arms, was chased
at midnight from the house on their selection
by a trio of blacks. She eventually scared
off the miscreants by calling to an imaginary
neighbor to bring his gun. The infant of that
episode is now a man in his forties. Inci-
dentally, one of the blacks boasted that he
was a brother of the notorious Campbell who
was hanged at Brisbane for his misdeeds in
the Wide Bay and Burnett districts many
years ago.
“Verde Gris” : Caruso’s first job, his bio-
grapher tells us, brought him in a penny an
hour —he was handy-boy in an engineer’s
shop. Commencing to warble for an occa-
sional lira, his voice rose from a silvery to
a golden tenor, and he finished up on a note
issue of about £2OOO a time. When operaing
in Berlin he was the only one allowed to
smoke behind the scenes, and a fireman was
told off to follow him about with a bucket of
water and stamp on his cigarette butts. This
sort of coddling turned him into a spoilt kid,
fat and greedy, but with a voice like slip-
stone peaches. His arrogance and petulance,
one way and another, hastened his end. He
seems to have regarded the approach of death
as a piece of infernal impudence.
“O. Archibald”: A recent police raid on
a two-up school in Melbourne was the re-
sult of information given by the embittered
wife of one of the players. So infatuated
was Spinner with this game of chance that
he quite overlooked his domestic responsi-
bilities, causing his exasperated helpmate to
give the police the office, which led to the
school being broken up and most of its
members arrested and fined. It was a fine
example of the irony of Fate that poor old
Spinner, at the time of the surprise visit, had
headed them six consecutive times, and,
doubling up each time, had won 60-odd quid!
Ever since the raid he has been trying to
make himself and his missus believe that
lie was just going to pull out and break for
home and shower the spoils on the household !
“K.L.” : “Seembee’s” “old man, living at
Indooroopilly 27 years ago, who boasted that
he had been dandled by Napoleon during
the retreat from Moscow” was doubtless
Louis Stamm, who died in Brisbane in 1903.
He owned a considerable amount of pro-
perty in Indooroopilly (though lie wasn’t
living there at the date mentioned), and had
been an alderman of the Brisbane City
Council. During the advance to Moscow
Napoleon stayed at the residence of Stamm’s
father. Louis was then a bright child of
five, and the Emperor, placing his hand on
the nipper’s head, exclaimed in as good Polish
as he could muster, “What a pretty boy !” By
the way, Stamm often recalled how Napo-
leon’s officers carried off the servant-girls
from his father’s estate. The maids only
escaped the fate of the Sabine women
through the earnest representations of
Stamm, sen., made personally to the Em-
peror.
“T. 0.1.” : That ex-Justice Chapman who, at
74, has been appointed president of the M.L.
Pensions Appeal Board, had a father who
covered a lot of ground in his time. In 1843
he was a M.L. Judge, and nine years later
Colonial Sec. of Tasmania, but resigned over
a disagreement with Governor Denison, who
was keen on continuing transportation. In
1855 he commenced to practise his profession
in Melbourne, was Law Lecturer at the ’Var-
sity, and, without a seat in the Leg. Assem-
bly, became Attorney-General in the first
O'Shanassy Ministry (1857). In 1858 he
was again in office as O’Slianassy’s Attorney-
General, this time with a seat in the Assem-
bly. In 1862-63 he acted as Justice while
Redmond Barry was on leave, and a couple
of years later again accepted a Maoriland
Judgeship. His wife and family (excepting
a son, presumably the M.L. Judge, who was
being educated in England) went down with
the London in the Bay of Biscay in January,
1866. The father did a good deal of writing
for the Westminster, London and other
quarterly reviews; contributed articles to
the 7th edition of the “Encyclopaedia Britan-
nica,” and wrote on colonial law to the Law
Magazine.

All Australia
Uses Rexona.
Never a day passes but that Rexona scores another triumph
over those serious troubles of life: Sores, Bad Legs, Piles, Eczema,
Pimples, Blotches, Burns, Nasal Catarrh and Rheumatism. The
dainty little triangular pot of Rexona, the Rapid Healer,
contains a combination of the most antiseptic, soothing and
healing properties known to science. Rexona is the Skin
Remedy of the Age, because it destroys the harmful germs that
may be present in a sore, pimple or any abrasion of the skin, thus
preventing any contagion of the blood, and at the same time
causes a new healthy skin to grow. Rexona immediately reduces
the inflammation and pain; it acts as a distinct stimulant to the
pores of the skin, and sets up a healing action immediately that
increases day by day. Bad leg sores that have resisted every
other treatment succumb almost immediately to its wonderful
influence, while for Piles there is nothing its equal.
In every home Rexona is an essential need, and if going
away for a holiday don’t let your vacation be spoiled by any of
the usual troubles, such as Sandfly or Mosquito Bites, Sore Feet,
or the ever-occurring Cuts, Burns
and Bruises incidental to holiday-
making; but take with you a pot of
Rexona and a box of Rexona Soap,
and thus be able to enjoy your holi-
day to the full.

WTFT comes the day !
The doomed night writhes, the treaclicr-
ous hands of dawn
Are on her throat; and silently they sway
Between the ghostly trees in wreaths of grey.
Shivering, the little night-winds cringe and
fawn,
Then run away.
The moonlight’s fled
Back to the paling moon. The shadows
shrink;
The tender dark is slain. And, widely shed,
The bold light paints the tree-trunks fawn
and red.
My tortured brain’s awake enough to think;
And dreams are dead.
But I may lie
All day in these cool pillows, if I can,
May draw them o’er again on that grey sky.
Only the red hibiscus there—the dye
On "silken folds, each crinkled, like a fan
Tied with a tie
Of palest green—
Is far too vivid when the vision’s sick,
And blots with crimson the unchanging
scene—
The almond-bough, the gum-tree gnarled and
lean,
The orchid plumes that on the trunk spring
thick,
The flowering bean
Seen through the door.
Within, the shadows climb the high-ceiled
room.
They crawl on formless limbs about the floor
And shrink and shrivel, waver more and
more
Before the pale gold lights that lap the gloom
And ripple o’er.
With sad, blind eyes
Such yellow days pass ever cold and dumb.
The morning does not say to me, “Arise!”
The grass upon the old paths grows and dies.
I know it not. The lilies still may come,
And butterflies
And flowering sage
Upon the hill ; but they are gone, in truth,
For me. All warfare that the world may
wage
And all that pallid dawn we call our age
And all the previous dark we call our youth
Have passed a stage
Beyond belief.
Between the flushing hills at eve, alone,
I know the dark comes softly, like a thief;
The bird falls silent, nestles to his leaf;
The sea sounds like one low eternal moan
Upon the reef
And fading sands.
Time has discarded yet another day.
My soul, look sadly on the shining bands
Of clouds, look on the wide and dusky lands;
Your light is past. Go humbly as you may
With folded hands.
Swift comes the night.
Layer upon layer and cobalt deep on deep;
The worlds shine on far past our puny light.
I turn and blind my eyes with crumpled
white,
Knowing the crushed day only wants to vreep
Beyond our sight.
QUEENSLAND.
L. PATRICIA FRANCIS.
William Waye’s Way at Golf.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WILLIAM WAYE, of the Triangle
Golf Club, was a power to be
reckoned with. All p/,t(s-golfers
are, especially plus- 4 ones; but he had
our sympathy when he talked about
his play, which was always. Though
he did not know it, there was a
bottle of whisky for anybody who could beat
him. Five years in pennant matches with-
out a reverse stood to his credit. I think
his egotism made his opponents nervous. It
is disconcerting when playing a man to be in-
formed, on reaching the tee for a bogey 5-hole,
that last Saturday he did it in 3, or, when
the green is 225 yards away, that he has
approached to withisn a foot of the pin dur-
ing the week. Mitre disconcerting, too, to
see him repeat such feats.
We hoped that Joe Boaker, the joker of
the Thistle Golf Chub, also a plus- 4 man,
would bring about his downfall, but Joe
admitted after the match, which he lost by
two holes, that Billy had beaten him at his
own game.
“At the first hole,” he said, “I pulled his
leg as hard as I could, but I couldn’t pull
it as long as he pulled it himself. When
he got a perfect 3 (bogey 5) I said, ‘Well
done, old chap; that record will never be
beaten.’ ‘Oh, yes, it will,’ he replied; ‘l’ve
been expecting to get a 2 there for quite
a long while.’ The same tiling happened
at the. fourth, bogey 3, where he got a 2.
He said he was after the 1; in fact, could
not understand why he had never got a 1 in
his life.”
He would have laid wagers on every shot
be made if he could have got takers, but the
Triangle members were tired of keeping him
supplied in golf balls. “If Kirkwood only
had my temperament,” he said finally, “lie
would stand head and shoulders above all
other golfers, though I wouldn’t mind giving
him a game even then.”
That settled it. It was Jack Kalnan who
suggested the treatment. He decided to in-
vite his cousin, Teddy Winslow, one of the
champion pros, of the adjoining State, for
a fortnights holiday, and pass him oft 1 under
an assumed name.
Teddy duly came to hand, and was in-
structed as to procedure, the main essential
being talk. In that direction Teddy was
not equal to bogey,” but there was no doubt
about his golf. It took exactly 12 days to
arrange the match. The question of luck
had cropped up at the club, and Teddv spoke.
rwpVrwTe th t o d /Y 1 " ot a !• and at the
poii lf fu. } ,n, \ 2 nK, K f 'V 4). Some would
all that skill, but I call it luck to a great
extent. Whereupon Billy had said : “In that
instance I should say it was luck, because
I'm a better player than you, and have
never yet got the fourth in 1 or the twelfth
in 2.”
Uproar, out of which Teddy eventually
emerged with a challenge. Billy had backed
himself to win over £lO by the time the
argument died down.
We forsook our own game to watch the
match next day.
Teddy won the toss, and drove a long,
straight ball off the tee. Billy did likewise,
and both got nicely on the green in twos.
Bach holed out in i. Billy just missiug a 3.
The second and third were halved in
fours, but Billy was one up at the
short fourth, getting a 2 to a 3.
All holes onwards to the eleventh wrnre
halved. At the twelfth Billy made Teddy
play his tee shot again, as lie was at least
two inches over the line. Teddy’s second
shot was a bit like his temper at that
moment, ruffled. Thus Billy reached two up
and six to play. The thirteenth was Teddy’s
owing to a beautiful stymie which he laid,
but Billy repaid the compliment at the next
hole, and was again two up and four to
play. This was serious. Teddy had made
only one mistake in that flurried drive, and
yet he was losing our money.
The fifteenth is our long hole, 475 yards,
with a lovely bunker 75 yards from the
green. Only hitters of the Mitchell type
and fools attempt to carry it with their
second, and not even then unless their first
has been one of the best. Billy and Teddy
got magnificent drives, the latter winning by
about 10 yai’ds. Both had good lies, so both
ordered brassies. Billy’s ball landed on top
of the bunker, paused momentarily, and
rolled back into it. Teddy’s shares imme-
diately hai’dened. His shot began by recre-
ating the helpless feeling. Away it went
just clear of the ground, and bumped before
it reached the bunker. However, it hopped
the obstacle, and we breathed again. Teddy
looked a sure winner as Billy clutched his
niblick in the bunker and let fly. Up the
ball went in a cloud of sand, and down it
came with a thud only 15 yards from the
pin. Teddy had a nice run up of 40 yards,
and finished 15 feet away. Billy’s approach
putt landed him a short six inches from the
drop in. Teddy had all the luck with his
putt. It was not quite straight, but just
crooked enough to cannon off Billy’s ball, and
tumble home for a 4 and the hole.
Three to play, and Teddy had to win
another hole to make our money safe.
At the next two each got correct fours,
so Billy was dormie one, and it looked as if
we were going to be £1 apiece down.
Our last hole is 225 yards and slightly
downhill: a nice drive can reach the green.
Teddy made no mistake about it, and we
could see his ball within puttable distance
of the tin. Once again the card looked favor-
able. Billy teed his ball as nonchalantly
as if at practice. His shot was as mono-
tonously perfect as his others, excepting that
it had a little too much power behind it.
The ball was crossing the green on its
second hop, due apparently to finish some
20 yards beyond in a pot-hole. What was
that rattle? Great Scott! It had struck
the flag-pin square and stopped dead!
There is little more to be said. Each
holed out for threes, and we paid the piper.
I’m afraid Teddy was the only sport amongst
us, for I do not think anybody else congratu-
lated the winner. The only consolation was
proffered by Jack Kalnan, who, I presume,
had to make himself right, as, the match had
been his idea. He said it was worth a tenner
to follow" such a game.
“That may be,” said Bob Hamill. “But
where’s the stuffing you were going to knock
out of Billy?”
Hal Shears got the next brain-wave. In
support of his scheme he used to say:
“Think, lads! Two bob only, and it gives
us a unique opportunity to get some of the
tenner back.”
It was Billy’s mania to get a 1 that gave
birth to Hal’s notion. “He shall have a 1
and many of them,” were his words to us
all, adding: “Every practice round he’ll get
1 at that fourth hole when he lands on the
green from the tee, and every time he gets
it we’ll demand the time-honored bottle of
whisky.”
I should explain that the fourth hole is
hidden from the tee, with a plantation of
pine-trees abutting on the green. Hal’s plot
was to place Dirty Dick, the caddy, in that
plantation. When Billy’s ball landed on
the green Dick was to hole it, and scoot for
shelter in the trees. From the plantation
Richard could, of course, see who was hit-
ting off the tee. Two shillings easily squared
the lad for action and silence.
Hal’s plot was better than Kalnan’s, in-
asmuch as it did not fail.
I shall never forget the look of flushed
victory on Billy’s face as he related how
he had got his first 1. “I never expected
it with that shot,” he owned. “I was not
as straight as I usually am. The ball must
have kicked.”
“Perhans it will only be the forerunner
of many,” chirped Hal with a slight flicker
in one eyelid.
“Probably,” answered Billy, and called
for a bottle of “No. 10” or “Golf-ball”
whisky.
During the next two months he got that
fourth hole in 1 five times, which, according
to Kalnan’s reckoning, equalled a return to
us of £3 2s. 6d. ; to wit, five bottles at
12s. 6d. per bottle. Not a murmur either
about it.
It was worth the tenner. Our chucklings
alone were cheap at the price, and we were
getting the whisky thrown in, besides
heartily enjoying the arrogance of Billy,
where before it had smarted.
On the day we had arranged for the sixth
1 to occur, Billy was playing with me. Of
course, he had the honor at the now notori-
ous fourth, and got a beauty straight for
the pin. “Looks like another 1,” he re-
marked.
“Yes.” I replied. “I wouldn’t be sur-
prised if it w-as.”
I took some time to tee up, so that Dirty
Dick could do his job properly. My shot,
was hardly straight. Billy said it would
be 10 yards to the right of the pin. As we
mounted the rise guarding the green, only
one ball came into view, and it was but a
foot from the hole.
“Hullo.” said Billy, “that looks like mine
for direction.”
“Where’s mine, then?” I asked.

Why Can’t You, Too, Be Well and Strong?

few of us realise how precious good health is until we
begin to lose it. To be well is to enjoy life and make
good times for those around us. To be constantly ailing
is to miss life s pleasures and to look with envy upon our
robust friends and neighbors.
Are you one of the unfortunates?
Is your health slowly slipping away? It’s time, then, you
looked to your kidneys!
Much sickness of to-day is traceable to kidney weakness.
Its increase is alarming. That’s because it’s usually
unseen or neglected.
But it s easy to tell if your kidneys are weak. You may
have only backache, dizzy spells, headaches, or annoying
bladder irregularities.
If you have these symptoms, suspect your kidneys! Remember that delay may result in serious
kidney sickness.
If you ve reason to suspect your kidneys, read the story of these Sydney residents, who have won back
good health through Doan s Backache Kidney Pills, the world’s best-recommended kidney remedy.
Doan s have helped thousands. They should help you! Ask your neighbor!
TWO SYDNEY RESIDENTS SPEAK.
TWO YEARS CURED.
Mr. Geo. A. Skinner, 37 Goodhope Street, Paddington, says:—“As a
result of a bad cold which settled on my kidneys, I suffered agony from
backache and was often so bad that I had to lie up, not being able to move
without enduring torture. The kidney secretionswere very much disordered,
being thick and cloudy, and I could not even turn in bed without j» stab-like
pain striking me across the loins. I took all kinds of kidney medicines,
but nothing gave me any permanent relief; and I was at a loss to know what
to do for a cure. A friend, hearing how I was suffering, suggested I should
try Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. I bought some at once, and after
taking them for a few days I was delighted to find thev were doing me good.
In a week or so I felt ever so much better, and by” the time I had used
five or six bottles I was completely cured. That was two years ago, and
I am still well, but I always keep Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills in the house
and take them now and again, as a tonic for the kidneys.”
SEVEN YEARS CURED.
Mrs. H. Sturgeon, 70 Marlborough Street, Surry Hills, Sydney, says:—
It gives me great pleasure to say a few words in praise of Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills. For a good while I was a martyr to kidney trouble,
the symptoms being backache, urinary disorder and dizzy attacks My
back ached fearfully and every movement was accompanied with a twinge
like the stab of a knife. The secretions were cloudv and scalded a °-ood
deal in passing, this symptom clearly showing mv kidneys were very much
out of order. I heard good reports of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills so
decided to give them a trial. The first bottle gave me relief, and by the time
I had used three bottles I was cured, and I have been well ever since a
period of over twelve months.”
. Si ? years later Mrs - Sturgeon says:—“My cure still holds good no
of P dne y disorder having returned since I took Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills seven years ago.”

“Perhaps it’s in the hole,” was the answer.
And sure enough it was. Dirty Dick
had beaten himself ana put my ball in by
mistake!
It’s a peculiar feeling to try to be all
placidity on the outside of your face while
just inside that face there is ferment. Billy
harped on that shot for the rest of the
round, adding with a grin as we reached
the club-house: "Of course, you know the
penalty, and I like that ‘Golf-ball’ brand.”
Nor did the tragedy end here.
After afternoon tea Billy went out and
watched the players finishing on the last
green. He was wonderfully interested in
knowing how they had got on. And no
wonder ! Eleven others reported ones at the
fourth, and as each did so Billy remarked :
“I like that ‘Golf-ball’ brand, you know.”
Ilal Shears’s star dropped like a bomb from
the empyrean.
It appeared later that Billy had become
suspicious when lie got his fourth 1. and
hired another caddy to act as a spy. A
five-shilling tip, with a tall threat of' mur-
der or such-like, had been enough to counter-
square Dirty Dick to put every ball, bar
Billy’s, that landed on the green that after-
noon into the hole.
We have now given up trying to take a
fall out of the greatest golfer who ever lived:
in fact, the majority of our members would
plank their stakes on our irresistible Billy
against Kirkwood, Hagen, Sarazen or
Havers.
J. SELWYN BROWN.
On the Road to Rapallo.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE olive-trees bordered the red road
with a grey-green shadow, and the
mellow dusk endued them with a
touch of fantasy, so that they looked like
goblin people suddenly arrested in their danc-
ing flight. For three miles the road to
Rapallo winds a tortuous way uphill, and
the soft red loam clings to the stoutest .shoes
and wearies the travelling feet. At the top
or the first hill Our Lady of Sorrows gazed
out of her shrine beckoning me to rest a
little at her feet. She stood at the head of
a long flight of rough-hewn steps which led
down to the shore. As I climbed the clear
voices of the fishermen below came faintly
up to me, piercing the serenity of the dusk.’
“Ebbene, Rwffo, buona pesca?”
“Niente!”
"Buon viaggio, Pasqualino!”
“Ohe, pescator!”
At last I arrived, panting, at the shrine,
and flung myself down on the rough stone. I
always bring Our Lady a handful of flowers
that I have gathered on my way. To-day I
had a scented cluster of blue hyacinths, and
I turned to lay them at her feet. But some-
one else had paid her sweet homage. Across
her small feet, which smiled out from under
her blue, trailing gown, a red rose lay, spray-
ing the air with its wilting fragrance.
And Our Lady, benign and tender, seeing
my surprise, bent down and told me how the
rose came there.
Along the road to Rapallo, soon after the
morning was born, a young girl came hurry-
ing. A basket of roses was slung over her
shoulders, and as she moved the cheap, brass
ear-rings dangled and clinked against the
long necklace of red beads round her neck.
As her swift feet put the miles behind her
she sang joyously:—
All—tu nun saie
Quanto stu core
Spantica e more
Luntano a ’te.
Nocchie lucente
Vocca addurosa
Occhiu de na rosa
Bella tu si.
Fiametta Grandi’s voice echoed the fierce
brightness of the day. Untrained and fear-
less it was, and she forced it with sublime
disregard of the future. Clear and piercing,
the notes came trilling, and as she walked her
swinging body moved to the rhythm of the
music. Her eyes, dark with the thoughts of
youth, shone with the realisation that she
was younger than the morning, and growing
to a more perfect blossoming than a flower
in bud. Occasionally she stooped to pluck
the hyacinths that spread audacious fingers
beneath her. feet, and the curves of her body
sang a sweeter tune than the carolling of her
open mouth.
Noccliie lucente
Vocca addurosa.
sang Fiametta.
Occhiu de na rosa
Beila tu si,
came the deep, rough voice of a man.
She turned swiftly to see what thief had
stolen the end of her song. There, framed in
the shimmering background of the olive-trees
which flung speckled shadows over his laugh-,
ing face, stood a young man wearing the
scanty garb of a coast fisherman.
“Giovanni!"
"Fia! Fiametta!”
Swifter than flying arrows they sped to
each other’s arms —stood there, breast to
breast, murmuring words that were less than
words, draining the wine-filled cup of their
youth.
Their bodies drew apart, but their hands
and eyes still clung together, .and they
laughed joyously at each other. Then a
sudden thought sent a dark shadow to the
man’s face.
“Ebbene, Giovanni, what is it?” Fia-
metta’s voice dripped with tenderness.
“Niente ! It is nothing !” He shrugged
his shoulders.
“Tell me,” she whispered. “Is it Maria?”
His mouth set in a hard, indomitable line.
He nodded.
“Si! El maledetta vecehia! I hate her,
Fiametta ! I have no peace. I eat my break-
fast to the tune of her anger, and at night
she is a thousand times worse. I will not
bear it, I! I, Giovanni Corimo, who am
young and loving—to be married to a shrew
20 years older than myself. I could kill my
father were he not already deep in his grave.
Madre de Dio,. che fiasco !”
“Ma non, Giovanni”—she set a protesting
hand on his lips, but he brushed it away,
his anger and self-pity rising to a tempestu-
ous torrent of speech.
“Per bacco, Fiametta, I will not bear it!
Three years have I lived with her in Hell
that her money should pay my father’s debts.
Three years, and yet no child to comfort us.
A child might soften her; but. no, her soft-
ness is worse than her temper. She smiles
at me with her little twisted eyes and shrun-
ken mouth, and my hate of her grows!” He
laughed savagely. “I told her this morning
that I would not come back to-night. She
clung to me with her thin arms, and shrieked
her stupid love for me. But I will not go
back.” His voice harshened to an angry sob.
“Per Dio, I will not go back!”
“But, Giovanni, what will you do?”
His voice changed again, and he looked at
her through half-closed eyes.
“What shall I do? Cara mia, do you know
what I shall do?”
She shook her head. Ilis arms crept
slowly round her, drawing her so near that
his eyes were drowned in hers.
“When the sun sets I shall come leaping
up the steps to the shrine of the Holy Virgin,
where you, Fiametta, will be waiting for
me.” His voice slipped down to a whisper-
ing caress. “I shall take you in my arms
and carry you down to the shore —to my little
boat. And we will sail over there to the
island together—you and I, Fiametta —and
begin life again. Eh, little bird?”
“Ma, non, Giovanni!” The lids crept down
over her eyes, hiding them from his eager
gaze.
“Ma, si, piccola! Do you not love me?”
“Ah, Giovanni, yes, but”
“Ebbene, you love me—that is enough.'
To-night you will wait for me at the shrine.”
“But she—Maria—your wife: she too loves
you!”
“She does not love me! Not after three
years has she given me a child —I who have
lived but to hold my son in my arms.” He
pleaded. “Fiametta, we are young, and she.
has forgotten at least her first youth. And
we love—not Paolo and Francesca loved so
dearly as we love. We do not harm her, mia
bclla. She will soon forget, and if she
miss me it will only be for lack of someone
to curse. Come with me, Fiametta!”
“Giovanni, I cannot choose. I dare not
choose!”
“Then I will choose for you!” He laughed
exultingly. “I choose that you wait for me
to-night!”
“And if”
“There shall be no ifs, beloved.” He
plucked a red rose from her basket and held
it over her head. “If I see this rose in your
hair as I climb the steps to-night, I shall
know that you will come.” He placed the
rose in her hand. “Prima di partire, un
bacio. cara!” He kissed her unresisting
mouth and went leaping down the steps
singing:—
Ah—tu nun saie
Quanto stu core— '
his voice floated up to her, faint and sweet.
Fiametta walked slowly on up the road,
thinking.
Through the blue, dim flower of the dusk
the white sleeves of a girl glowed like far
sails on a sea of darkness. She stood lean-
ing against the pillar which carried the little
image of Mary. Her bright ear-rings glit-
tered fitfully, and in her hair, scenting it
with sweet ness, was a red rose.
1' lametta’s ears caught the sound of foot-
steps on the road, and she drew further into
the shadow.
To the shrine came a small, bent, woman
carrying in her thin hands a burden of white
flowers. She knelt on the stone and prayed.
"Ave Maria, Madre de Dio”— — Her face
turned up to the tender face carved in tin
stone above her.
Fiametta moved forward.
"Maria Corimo!” she whispered.
The little woman turned.
“Fiametta Grandi! Strange to see you
here!” Her voice was thin like her hands,
hard and taut, but there was suffering in it.
“And to see you, Maria! It is not often
you come so far to pray.” She bent and fin-
gered the white almond blossoms. “These—
so sweet!”
Maria Corimo’s eyes softened. “I brought
them for the Mother of God —to thank her.”
“Thank her?” Fiametta’s young eyes
questioned Maria’s faded eyes.
“I have not deserved it. but Our Lady of
her great tenderness has granted me my wish
—in the winter my child will be born. Gio-
vanni’s child.” Her voice was soft and wor-
shipping. She turned again to the face above
them. “Madre, Madre Maria, let it be a
son—let it be a son!” She whispered tin'
words over and over, forgetting the girl be-
side her.
Fiametta stood there watching the praying
mouth that trembled with the force of its
pleading. Then the hand of Fiametta went
slowly to her hair. Stooping, she laid the
rose at Mary’s feet and stole softly away.
Her feet stirred the grass beneath them to'a
plaintive lisp as she wrnnt quietly down the
road.
PAMELA TRAVERS.
The Visitor.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oil, Love has called! T was not in.
Then bar the shutters ’gainst all din;
For I would sit and mourn my sin.
Love rode the steed of hot desire.
Swift as the wind and breathing lire.
Adown the road, before the noon
He sought my heart to crave his boon;
Sweet-tongued, he through my lattice called—
Alack! My heart in stone was- walled.
Love came too soon.
Love tarried in his way to me.
Afoot, in beggar’s guise came he;
Adown the road to prove his fate
He came at dusk unto my gate.
All woe to me, for I was out!
He turned his pretty self about—
Love came too late!
