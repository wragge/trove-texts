When You Die
Maurice Maeterlinck has superseded
Death. That essay he has so extended and
revised in Our Eternity (Methuen, per
Dy mock’s Library) that Maeterlinck’s Death
may be considered dead. It appears, first
that we have libelled death. \We impute to
death the tortures of the last illness—
which logically form part of life. Nobody
blames death for illnesses from which he re-
covers. Also, death is not to blame for the
coffin and the grave/ It isn’t death but we
who dispose of the corpse.
There are four possible things that
will happen to you—the particular you,
gentle reader: total annihilation, survival
with your consciousness of to-day, survival
without any sort of consciousness, or
survival in the universal consciousness or
with a consciousness different from that
whicli you possess in this world. Maeterlinck
examines these possibilities anxously and at
ength. Total 'annihilation is impossible;
tor: ±o be able to do away with a thing,
that is to say, to fling it into nothingness,
nothingness would have to exist; and, if it
exists, under whatever form, it is no longer
nothingness.” And : “If nothingness were
possible, since it could not be anything what-
ever, it could not be dreadful.”
The second possibility, your survival with
.loiu piesent consciousness, is also impossible.
Your ego is difficult to define, but the most
steadfast point of it is your memory, which
happens to be one of the frailest faculties of
your brain, one of those which disappear the
most promptly at the least-disturbance of
youi health. And would you be you without
your memory? Your consciousness, that you
are so anxious to preserve through infinity,
you lose, strange to sajq at any moment in
life without feeling the least anxiety. Sleep,
a shock, an illness, a wound, a little opium,
seven consecutive beers, and your conscious-
ness vanishes. Besides, if you are going to
exist always as you are, you must admit that
you have always existed—and what con-
sciousness have you of your previous exist-
ences?
J*
The chief importance of this essay is the
. exhaustive consideration the author gives of
the Neospiritualistic hypothesis—in other
words, The Manners and Customs of Spooks.
From the Proceedings and the Journal of
the Society of Psychical Research Maeter-
linck is convinced that: —-
It appears to be well established as a fact
can be that a spiritual or nervous shape, an
image, a belated reflection of life, is capable
of subsisting for some time, of releasing it-
self from the body, of surviving it, of trav-
ersing enormous distances in the twinkling of
an eye, of manifesting itself to the living and,
sometimes, of communicating, with them.
But these spooks, Maeterlinck sorrowfully
admits, are very short-lived. They happen
only at the moment of death or very shortly
after; and they never tell us anything about
the new world in which they find themselves.
Similarly, when we get into wireless com-
munication with the ddad, by means of
“mediums,” we cannot get any valuable in-
formation from them. They give us a lot
of tittle-tattle about ourselves, but they can’t
tell us where, they are, what they feel, or
what they do to fill in their time. However,
scientific investigators like Frederick Myers,
Richard Hodgson and William James are
now dead, after haying promised to let us
know all they could from the other side.
Myers kept his word. A month after his
death he spoke through a medium to Oliver
Lodge. “He was recognised by the first few
words he spoke; it was really he; he had
not changed.” But he seemed dazed: he
had forgotten about the Society for
Psychical Research, the sole interest in his
life. He gossiped about his obituary
notice in Tiie Times. As for his present
condition, “he groped his way as if through
passages, before he knew he was dead. He
thought lie had lost his way in a strange
town.... and, even when he saw people that
he knew were dead he thought they were
only visions.” But Maeterlinck reminds us
that these “communications” were made
through a medium, and that they are most
probably but reminiscences of a secondary
personality of the medium or unconscious
suggestiqns of the questioner or the sitters.
Maeterlinck puts down these phenomena to
“the incomprehensible power of the
mediums, which is no more improbable than
the survival of the dead.” However, the
spiritualistic theory is too new, the experi-
ments are yet too few, for the author defi-
nitely to reject this evidence. “Hitherto,
everything remaiffs in suspense.”
It would be not unlikely that the memory
which represents us during our life should
continue to do so for a few weeks or even a
few years after . our decease. This would
explain the evasive and deceptive character
of those spirits which, possessing but a
mnemonic existence, are naturally able to
interest themselves only in matters within
their reach. Hence their irritating and man-
iacal energy in clinging to the slightest facts,
their sleepy dulness, their incomprehensible
indifference and ignorance and all the
wretched absurdities which we have noticed
more than once.
So much for the spooks. However,
Maeterlinck admits that perhaps we have
not sufficiently recognised the difficulties of
telepathic communication. The science is
only 30 years old.
J*
Astounding hypnotic experiments, made
by a savant, invade a realm still more re-
mote. ■ Colonel de Rochas recounts the
story of Josephine, a French girl of 18.
Hypnotised, she is made to retrace her steps
backward through time.
By means of downward passes, she is
brought back to the condition of a baby at its
mother’s breast. The passes continue, and
the wonder-tale *runs its course. Josephine
can no longer speak; and we have the great
silence of infancy, which seems to be fol-
lowed by a .silence more mysterious still.
Josephine no longer answers except by signs;
she is not yet born .... The sleep becomes
heavier; and suddenly from the depths of
that sleep rises the voice of another being, a
voice unexpected and unknown, the voice of a
churlish, distrustful and discontented old
man. They question him. At first, he re-
fuses to answer, saying that “of course lie’s
there, as he’s speaking” ; that “he’s in the
dark.” They increase the number of the
passes, and gradually gain his confidence.
He gives his name and tells the story of
his life. He was born in 1812, and dies at
the age of 70.
We now hear the dead man speak; and
his posthumous revelations are not sensa-
tional, which, however, is not an adequate
reason for doubting their genuineness. He
“feels himself growing out of his body” ; but
he remains attached to it for a fairly long
time. His fluidic body, which is at first
diffused, takes a more concentrated form. He
lives in darkness, which he finds disagree-
able; but he does not suffer. At last, the
night in which he is plunged is streaked with
a_ few flashes of light. The idea comes to
him to reincarnate himself, and he draws
near to her who is to be his mother (that
is to say, the mother of Josephine). He
encircles her until the child is born, where-
upon he gradually enters the child’s body.
• • • - The next thing is to go back beyond the
old man, Jean Claude. A mesmerisation
lasting nearly three-quarters of an hour, with-
out lingering at any intermediate stage,
brings the old man back to babyhood. A
fresh silence, a new limbo; and then, sud-
denly, another voice and an unexpected
individual.
This is a wicked old lady who was born
in 1792. Before her reincarnation she had
been a little girl who died in infancy. Pre-
vious to that she was a man who had corfi-
mitted murder; “and it was to expiate this
crime that she had endured much suffering
in the darkness, even after her life as a
little girl, when she had had no time to do
wrong. I did not think it necessary to
carry the hypnosis further, because the sub-
ject appeared exhausted, and her paroxysms
were painful to watch.”
Maeterlinck states that not only had Colonel
de Rochas obtained . similar results with
other subjects, but that other experimenters
have done what he did. These must be
classed among “the incontestable facts of
hypnotism.” What do they prove? It has
been found that the revelations were occa-
sionally inaccurate and full of anachro-
nisms. _ Yet extraordinary is the fact of cer-
tain visions recurring with the same char-
acteristics in the case of a considerable
number of persons unknown to each other.
One curious fact is that, though the patients
are Christians, they never allude to hell or
paradise, the traditions of which they must
carry deep down in themselves. And they
tell nothing of “the dark,” about which, if
charlatans, they could so easily invent- fan-
tastic details. There remains, however, the
chance of unconscious suggestion on the
part of*the hypnotists. Maeterlinck allows
for this, but notes: “We carry in ourselves
all the past, all the experience of our an-
cestors.”
J* ■
Still, the doctrine of reincarnation, thus
adumbrated, does not help you much in your
quest, since if you forget whom you have
been the fact that you have been is of no
value to you. Survival with your present
consciousness is as impossible and as incom-
prehensible as total annihilation. Anyhow,
without your body, it could not be painful.
The only hypothesis left is that you survive
death, but with a modified consciousness, in
which, your present consciousness is almost
negligible. Your ego will go on, voyaging
for ever in infinity, merging gradually into
the cosmic consciousness. And it is absurd
to suppose that that cosmic consciousness
could be evil, or that infinity could be male-
volent. There’s a good time coming for you
all.

Ballades of Banvilie
So rare is it for a book written by an
Australian to get anything but a slighting
paragraph from that old British curmudgeon,
Tiie AtheNjEUJI, the most representative of
the English literary journals, with its tradi-
tional insular attitude grudgingly cherished,
that there is pleasure in quoting the gist of
its praise for' The Ballades of Theodore de
Danville, translated into English verse by
Archibald T. Strong; of Melbourne.
“It is not, too much to say t that Mr.
Strong possesses every qualification needed
to effect a successful translation of Ban-
ville’s Ballades into English verse.... His
short Introduction on the Ballade of Y’illon
is, indeed, a masterly exposition of the dif-
ference between th& two. poets, and shows so
just an appreciation of the merits of each
as to proclaim his fitness for the task he lias
undertaken.... It is rarely that we can
cavil, for at each departure from the strict
word lie _ becomes, if possible, more true to
his original in the spirit... .The second
respect in which the author has shown his
capacity is in his complete mastery of the
Ballade—that most difficult of all poemes d
forme fixe....He is especially happy in his
refrains.... In spite of the closeness of ren-
dering that has for the most part been ob-
served, these Ballades do not read like trans-
lations... .Lastly, Mr. Strong has just the
lightness of touch, the sense of rhythm and
facility of diction that we find in his model
.... In a work of such general excellence
there is little to criticise.”
All that is necessary for us to do is to
quote in confirmation a fine sample of
Archibald T. Strong’s work as translator-
poet.
BALLADE OF HIS LASS.
Puppets on every hand I see
Like Fagotin’s, both small and great,
One to the planets bends the knee,
Another early hunts and late
All for a coin or curious plate,
All for a ring or musty screed:
But I, who leave my life to Fate,
The lass I love is all I need.
The beggar for his farthing's fee
Will hang all day at Dives' gate.
The rake, with frolic eyes and free,,
Will many a tale o’ lust narrate:
Some o’er the wine-bowl brawl and prate,
Some to the laurels late succeed
With secret labor obstinate —i
The lass I love is all I need.
Some to the maiden sidtors be
Whose babbling tongue doth ne’er abate,
But prattles on in silvery glee:
Bach hussy 's worth her golden weight
To her- poor fool of rich estate,
For every trull will still be fee’d
And every minx will find a mate —-
The lass I love is all I need.
Envoi.
Let Rothschild keep his golden state,
Leverrier all his heavens read ,
And Nisard all his texts collate
The lass I love is all I need.
From “The Ballades of Theodore de Ban-
vilie,” translated into English verse by
Archibald T. Strong (Macmillan).
Syphilis and Suffragette
There will be exceeding joy throughout
humanity at the announcement that
Christabel Pankhurst has discovered a cure
for syphilis. It has been freely admitted by
its discoverer that it is too soon yet to decide
whether salvarsan is a permanent cure. But
in the January issue of Science Progress
(Murray) it is stated that the treatment of
the disease has made a great advance in
Ehrlich’s discovery. “Perhaps its effects are
not ail that were claimed at first; but it
rapidly curtails the' more obvious symptoms
of the disease, and, when combined with
mercury, leads to a quicker Cure than was
formerly possible.” Hence the announce-
ment by Christabel Pankhurst of a certain
cure at once links her name with those of
Pasteur and Lister.
From the useful article in Science
Pkogkess we learn that there is no definite
mention of the disease in the classics —even
Ovid did not describe the horror. The
Biblical prophecy about the sins of Dad be-
ing visited upon the kiddies to the third and
fourth generation, if it refer to syphilis, is
inaccurate, since syphilis is transmitted
from parents to children for one generation
only. The general belief is that the disease
did not exist until the 15th century—that
it originated among the soldiers engaged in
the later crusades, or was brought back
from America by the men of Columbus and
Cortez. It is even probable that stout Cortez
might have been meditating upon this un-
pleasant fact when he stood so long “silent
upon a peak in Darien.”
But General Belief is an unreliable sol-
dier; and the reason why this disease is not
mentioned in the classics is simply the rea-
son why it was not mentioned in the Sydney
Herald news columns till about a year ago,
and in her editorial columns until only the
other day. It wasn’t considered polite to
mention the word. So a student of our
history, confining his attention solely to the
Herald, would note that in the year 1914
Australia discovered the existehce of a new
and dreadfully serious disease. Evidently
the Herald was, until this year, suffering
from the obsession that syphilis was in-
vented or created or developed by God as a
punishment for sin, and therefore a disease
which it would be blasphemy to alleviate or
cure and rude to mention. All the more
merit, therefore, to Christabel Pankhurst in
thus boldly stepping forward and proclaim-
ing her cure.
Unfortunately for this hypothesis, syphilis,
or a disease closely allied to it, has been dis-
covered in rabbits! As the writer in
Science Progress says: “The old idea
which placed the origin of syphilis in Divine
wrath is no longer tenable, for surely rabbits-
have incurred no such displeasure; nor did
rabbits or guinea-pigs play any part in the
crusades, nor in the conquest of America.
It seems more likely that syphilis has ex-
isted in the human race as long as that race
has existed, and even longer; and that per-
haps it has taken its place in the evolution
or tire animal kingdom, and with the evolu-
tion of the species has come the
evolution of their parasites and their dis-
eases.” Either bunny must share with the
evil man the displeasure of the Wowser
or syphilis is a tnere profane disease, the
cure of which is the job of medical science
and, the suffragette. Already, owing to this
discovery of syphilis among the rabbits, there
is the foreshadowed possibility of vaccination
against syphilis. "The parasites of small-
pox, cow-pox, human and animal syphilis,
seem to belong to the same family;; and there-
fore it appears reasonable to shppose that
rabbit syphilis, if vaccinated into human
beings, would modify or prevent the human
disease... .Experiments to this end with
monkeys are being instituted forthwith.”
Such a method of preventing syphilis, says
the writer, appears to hold out the best hope
of solving the problem. But Edward Halford
Boss, of the J. H. McFhdden Researches at
the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine,
has overlooked Ohristabel and Christabel’s
cure.
You can learn all about in in The Great
Scourge and Hoio to End It, by Ohristabel
Pankhurst (E. Pankhurst, Kingsway, Lon-
don, Is.). Briefly stated, that cure is:
"Votes for Women and Chastity for Men 1”
A simple prescription, easy to take, and of
infallible efficacy, such is Ohristabel Pank-
hurst’s short way with syphilis. Why is
there opposition on the part of males to giv-
ing spinsterettes the vote? “That reason is
sexual vice. The opponents of votes for
women know that women, when they are
politically free and economically strong, will
not be purchasable for the base uses of vice.”
Though the suffragette does not mention Aus-
tralasia, it is well known here that the rea-
son why no girls leave home is their cher-
ished possession of a vote. When the
seducer comes along, the Australian maiden
merely holds up an electoral roll and re-
marks, “You cannot harm me now!”
“Prostitution must go! This canker of
venereal disease is eating away the vitals of
.the nation, and the only cure is Votes for
Women.” Miss Pankhurst still apparently
believes that syphilis and gonorrhoea are
Divine punishments devised for immoral man-
kind and still more immoral rabbits. “A cure
for sexual disease,” she exclaims, in refer-
ence to salvarsan, “which is of all diseases
the most incurable! —as though Nature had
not willed that there should be no way of
escape from this scourge except one, and that
one the way of purity.” And she seems
pleased that syphilis is difficult to cure. One
cannot help suspecting her of the hope that
salvarsan will prove a failure. If Votes for
Females can Cure syphilis, why is it that the
movement for a campaign of publicity against
this scourge came first from England, and has
only now got into the publicity of the Aus-
tralian daily press? The male doctors of
England initiated the movement! the women
of Australasia, with votes a-plenty, have so
far done: nothing tangible : the movement here
is in the hands of public-hearted doctors and
journalists. Yet the shriek of Ohristabel
Pankhurst, LL.B., is of value: her state-
ments one suspects of exaggeration ; but the
frankness of her writing and its informative
value to women are useful factors in the
coming publicity campaign. The more that
is known about these twin venereal diseases
the better, and it matters little whether this
subject is ventilated in scientific quarterlies
or used as a neg upon which Ohristabel Pank-
hurst can hang a belated plea for votes.
—
The 20th edition of that delightful antho-
logy of the open air, The Open Road, com-
piled, by E. V. Lucas ("Methuen, per George
Robertson, Sydney), takes the form of a
lordly volume lavishly illustrated in color,
the English price -tof which is 15s. The first
edition published in 1599 was a pbcket edi-
tion, and the editor aimed merely at “pro-
viding companionship on the road for city-
dwellers who make holiday” ; but this edi-
tion cannot be slipped into the pocket, and
would considerably weight a trunk. - But
the selection is so delightful that even in the
home it clamantly evokes the road. As a
gift book, therefore, it has many claims.
But it seems a pity that E. V. Lucas did
not make use of some of the many songs of
the open written by Australian poets. A
similar pocket anthology suggests itself to
an Australian publisher.

Your Cycling
will cost you less
if your choice is right at purchasing time.
You may be offered a bicycle at a lower
price than one built with Genuine B.S.A.
Fittings, but think of the days to come,
when reliability and easy cycling will
mean a great deal more to you than the
saving of a few shillings at buying time.
Remember, when you buy a B.S.A. you always get
full value for money—you get a machine that you
will be proud of, and one that will fetch twice the price
of a *' pattern ” machine should you wish to dispose of it.

SCHOOL TEACHERS WHO SUFFER FROM
INSOMNIA AND NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.
The following is a testimony to the nerve-restoring powers of
Clements Tonic. One of the most brain-racking of duties is that of
public-school teaching—correctly training “ the young idea how to
shoot,” making pupils perfect by examination time —these great de-
partmental wonies make nervous breakdown and insomnia common
ailments amongst the rank and file of public school teachers. This
letter is from a lady who has been a brilliant example of her pro-
fession, having held the following high appointments in the Educa-
tional Department of New South Wales :
First Assistant Fort Street Model School for Girls.
Mistress, East St. Leonard’s School.
Assistant Mistress, Cleveland Street Public School.
Mistress, West Redfern Public School.
This testimony must appeal with commanding force to each member
of the Educational Department, showing what a nerve-soothing,
insomnia-killing, and health-restoring medicine they have in Clements
Tonic. All they need do is to try and persevere with it. The rest
• with health are certain. Miss CARDWELL writes from her resi-
dence, “ Coree,” 45 Booth Street, Annandale, 27/8/13, thus :
CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.
"I have great pleasure in giving my testimony to the benefits derived
H rom Clements Tonic as a builder up when in a rua-down condition.
* ‘When teaching in the State Schools of New South Wales, I many
times resorted to its use, taking one to three bottles in course.
“The ever-constant strain on the nerves of a Public School Teacher
soon brings on a low state of the whole system. In my case it was over-
strain in teaching, and mental worry through family bereavements. I had
been taking prescribed medicines, but seeing Clements Tonic advertised, I tried
one small bottle, and feeling so much benefit from its use, got the larger size.
It was such a restorative that when 1 felt the least run-down, I at once sent for
Clements Tonic, anl it never failed me. No household should be without it,
or fail to use it in any case of over-strain, for I feel sare it will have the
desired effect."
I am, Sirs, gratefully yours,
CLEMENTJ TONIC MAKES INSOMNIA A THING OF THE PAST.

Let fVle Rid You of Your
VARICOSE VEINS
Mr. G. VECSEY.
If you suffer from Varicose Veins or Ulcers, or both, I believe that I can
completely cure you. I have treated hundreds of -terrible cases with the
utmost success, and I know that but very few cases really incurable.
Very few doctors tell you they can cure this trouble. They prefer to ignore
it. Doctors could not cure me. I cured myself. I then cured my friends,
and then made hundreds of new friends by curing people who had suffered in
some cases lor a quarter century. Ilcnce I believe I can cure you.
It will pay you well to fully investigate my method. My treatment is applied at your own
home, and does not require you to lay up, and is painless and harmless. The worst cases usually
respond inside the first few weeks, and old, stubborn cases are perfectly cured under a suitable
course of treatment. GUARANTEE GIVEN IN EVERY CASE ACCEPTED.
Give me full details of your case. If I can cure you I will say so, and send you a guarantee.
You run no risk. You can lose nothing if I should fail; but I have built up a large business
—not on failures, but on successes in cases formerly given up as hopeless. Let me send you
hundreds of grateful testimonials.
WE WILL SEND YOU SCORES OF LETTERS LIKE THE FOLLOWING:—
Manager Yecsey Yarix-arinm, Rathscar, \ ic., June 9, 1913.
Dear Sir, —After twenty-four years’ suffering from bad varicose veins,
your treatment has given me back the use of my legs, comfortable and free
from pain, and my gratitude can be better imagined than described. Since
beginning the treatment, and ever since I completed it, I have noticed a vast
difference in my heart action; my circulation is greatly improved, and I feel
better in every respect. Prior to the treatment, my heart was very bad. There
is no doubt that the treatment is not only harmless, but it is wonderful as
well. —Yours gratefully, V’. J. JARDINE.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A Tango D-v-I.
Introducing the Tango was like introducing Satan
himself. It was a spider’s web set by the Devil to
entrap weak women, —Melbourne preacher.
“Won’t you come into my classroom?”
Asked the Devil of the Maid,
“For the floor is simply perfect,
And you need not be afraid.”
Round his Nibs, instead of brimstone,
Clung the odor of romance ;
“Come,” he cried “and learn the movements
Of the new Satango dance.”
He was quite as nice a devil
As a girl could wish to meet,
And in pumps of patent leather
He concealed his cloven feet;
ITe was elegant and stylish.
And no one would ever guess
That a spiky tail was hidden
Underneath his ev’ning dress.
Into love their friendship ripened,
Till she blushed to meet his look,
But avowed she’d ne’er regretted
Any Tango steps she took!
So the Devil wooed and won her.
Now the two together dwell
In a fine asbestos villa.
In the nicest part of Hell!

A Singer’s Love.
Many are the ways to make love 4:6 a lady,
The same will do to make love to a wench ;
In the palace, on the bridge, in the bower so
shady,
In the hall, or by a garden bench.
Vary but the formula if it be a lady,
Make no preludes if it be a wench.
This is the way to make love, my dove,
This is the way to make love:
Molly be jolly
•Tog o’ my knee,
Nobody’s coming
Sweet Jessamy.
Make a good beginning with a lady by obeis-
ance,
A well-formed leg is shown off by a bow,
Wear the long striped hose of the very dun
Renaissance,
And doff the hat as I do doff it now.
But after this respectful showing kiss her
finger tips,
And follow it in half an hour by pressing of
her lips.
This is the way to make love, my dove.
This is the way to make love:
Honey pot, honey pot,
Come to me.
Hug me and hold me
On land and sea.
Kissing has been spoiled by uneducated
people.
Amateur folk who never go to school ;
Ere you face the altar underneath the steeple
Learn the game or else you’ll look a fool;
Learn to kiss a little so that when you have
a wedding
Your, memory is clear on every rule,
This is the way to make love, my dove:
Kissing and blushing
An’ je? o’ my knee,
Nobody’s coming
Sweet Jessamy.

Malolo.
Malolo is Tongan, it signifies rest.
They’ve got it in plenty, these “Isles of the
Blest.”
The first word of kids and the last of the old.
It grapples them all in a sure strangle-hold.
Malolo, as dire as the “Fate” of the Turk !
“Malolo this morning, to-morrow for work.”
“To-morrow, to-morrow,” but never “to-day,”
They wait for an advent that comes not
their way.
Malolo, malolo, O musical word!
Especially so when by womankind purred.
Allurine-, as song of the siren that mocks
The sailor-man’s crash on the Mermaidens’
Rocks.
“Come, rest on this bosom, my own” —it is
here
That the warrior wanderer starteth to clear.
Once hark to her bidding, once drop to her
mat,
Malolo may make you for ever lie fiat
In supine contentment, inglorious ease,
As one who has drunk of Life’s wine to its
lees;
As one who, with nothing to worry about,
Unhinged, is a quitter, ignored, counted out.
Oh, run about, friend, though the sun may
be hot,
If the shade is inviting, its promise is not;
Or, best, run away, there is safety ’way back
In the land whence you came, on the worka-
day track.
There is safety away from the lotus and
palm,
There are hones that can’t stir in this back-
water calm.
Are there deeds to be done, are there schemes
to be planned
In a place by continual restfulness banned?
Malolo is neither for you nor for me;
Malolo is all that one ought not to be'
It makes any principles hard 'to endure,
And ends just in atrophy, speedy and sure.
Malolo, malolo. I know you too well!
We start to enjoy you for “just a short
spell.
A spell that grows longer and longer, until
W e cannot escape, for we haven’t the will.
Malolo. the creed of the done and the dead,
“!! euitaph meet for a race that is sped.
All those to whom effort gives lively disgust
Are summed bv Malolo, which signifies rust.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some-
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to-
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person mag not be
there; the official always is.

A POLICY FOR THE TERRITORY.
Dear Bulletin, —It is surely time for some
Australian Government to take off its coat
in earnest to the task of establishing and
carrying through a definite policy for the
Northern Territory. At more or less fre-
quent intervals Australia is loudly assured
that the Territory is a Garden of Eden, a
Paradise of the Tropics, a Jewel of Empire,
and an Ideal Spot generally. But the Terri-
tory persists in remaining very empty, and
even in becoming steadily emptier so far as
any really useful population is concerned.
Government officials are not useful popula-
tion in this sense, nor are the few handfuls
of sto&kmen who work the great cattle sta-
tions. Usefulness in the national sense can
only be supplied by the kind of population
which will be sufficiently numerous to stand
off the invader with real guns whilst it is
developing the Great Natural Resources of
which we are told so much and so loudly.
The history of the Territory has been one
of muddle, neglect and failure. To-day it
has culminated in a collection of Govern-
ment officials all travelling furiously on an
allowance of two guineas or so a day, pre-
sided over by a Scottish horse-doctor of
great eminence. in the horse-medicine line,
whose outstanding characteristic is a super-
human faculty for making himself personally
•disliked. . Cliques and jealousies abound,
petty dignities are constantly being trodden
upon with resultant sulking and language,
and the Prime Minister of Australia has
admitted publicly that he has no knowledge
•of how the administration is being carried
'°n. As a plot for a comic opera it would
make the reputation of a second Gilbert,
but from the mere Australian standpoint
there is no real humor in it.
* * * *
At bottom the successful settlement of
the Territory is a business problem, pure
and simole. Before a population can be
settled and rendered reasonably self-support-
ing in a new country it requires markets and
means of communication. Markets are any
old places where there are enough people to
buy things for more than they cost to pro-
duce and transport. Communication in-
cludes the transport both ~f people and the
(lungs they produce. So far no serious
attempt seems to have been made to develop
these, essential antecedents to the successful
P® o P] ln g °1 the Territory. Government agents
ot all sorts have gabbled furiously up and
•down the shores of Asia for a generation
past, and have filled endless waste-pa Der
baskets with innumerable reports. But
(here does not seem to have been any genuine
attempt to classify and tabulate the de-
mands of that vast proportion of the human
race which lives within a few davs’ steam
ot Palmerston, for the long list of tropical
products which we are so vociferously as-
sured that the Terri torv can produce,
ihe opponents of a White Australia are
never tired of arguing that the Territory can
never develop a market, but nobody makes
any serious effort to find out whether it can
or not. The transportation question is as
dead as the market one. Fierce battles are
tougbt over the stragglv little dead-end
trolleyway to Pine Creek, but there is no
public mention of lines to open up the rich
areas of agricultural highlands which,
according to various stentorian folk, are
crying out for a white population. Palmer-
ston has a harbor which evokes delighted
bursts of self-advertisement from eminent
Australians returning from Japan and see-
ing a little of their own country on the
way, but we do not seem to hear of any
statesmanlike proposals for oversea carriage
direct, from this natural centre of commerce
to the places where the markets might be
found if somebody went out and looked for
them seriously. In fact, the principal trans-
portation problem in the Territory appears
to consist in attending to distress signals
tor petrol and sandwiches from a lost Ad-
ministrator marooned in an expensive but
mined motor-car somewhere in the dry
country.
* * * *
The Territory has no immediate political
value m the sense of helping a party to
keep a death-grip on office, but is the sort
of place that may at any time develop with
extreme suddenness and importance, which
will induce enthusiastic crowds to suspend
politicians by the neck on convenient sup-
ports. The crude, rude basis of the matter
is. that if we do not people the Territory
within the next, few years, somebody else
will, and there is an excellent chance that
in the resultant scrap the Commonwealth
will go down in fire and smoke. Even an
eventual success would set back develop-
ment and progress by a quarter of a cen-
tury.
* * * *
A sane Administration which was not
forced to sacrifice its country and every-
thing else to keeping the other partv out of
office, might be expected to attack the
problem somewhat as follows. Presuming
that it were intended to make a beginning
with 5000 families —and this is about the
minimum for practical purposes—the exist-
ing horde of Government officials would be
turned on to some really useful work in
selecting and getting into order a sufficient
area of suitable land. Provision would be
made at the same time for sufficient surplus
to enable the young sons of to-day to acquire
places of their own when they reach man-
hood. The productive possibilities of each
area would be worked out by experts with
an eye to the available markets, and the
means of transportation. Lines of light
railway would be surveyed to link the
various parts of the area to be settled with
the coast and the main railway. Road
communication would be planned deliberately
with an eve to motor and road railway
transport from the farm to the rail. Mean-
while the market question would be dealt
with definitely and accurately, by some-
thing very different from the cheap'political
“aorput” fipf] ignorance
are bywords in old Asia. The routine work
of such an undertaking would be great,
and the railing of dry political and official
bones appalling, but no scheme of colonisa-
tion can become possible until it has been
done thoroughly. Once this spade-work was
complete it would become possible to out-
line the details of procedure, and to esti-
mate the cost with some approach to accu-
racy. Presuming at large—for Knibbs
himself couldn’t do more than guess in the
present darkness—that the initial 5000
families were going to cost five millions to
establish, or at the rate of £3OOO per family,
a politician-proof fund would be established
to carry on the work. Rail and road ques-
tions would be dealt with first, and the
selected area opened up for transportation.
The surveying of settlement blocks would be
completed, and their initial preparation for
actual use begun. The dav has gone by
when desirable settlers can be attracted by
the prospect of spending a lifetime in slog-
ging timber off their land, and in any case
they do it in a wasteful and uneconomic
way. Steam saws and hauling engines
would replace the primitive axe and crow-
bar, and the sawmill with a railway behind
it would enable a return to be obtained
from the more valuable woods, after local
requirements had been filled. Sources of
origin for sand, stone and similar materials
for permanent construction would be
and connected up for transport. Water
sources would be conserved, and their future
distribution worked out. The health pro-
blems of the settlement would be carefully
studied, and necessary precautions formu-
lated against malaria, dvsentery and other
preventable diseases. School sites, township
sites, telegraphic and telephonic communiea-
tion and the other ganglia and nerves of
the modern social organism would be planned
out ahead of the actual settlement. Finally
the houses would be built on suitable and
substantial lines, with every attention to
the climatic conditions. It is just as cheap
and easy to build in this way as in any
other, and neglect to do so would strike at
the very vitals of the undertaking. Why
should white families devour hot corned beef
at mid-day in a verandahless humpy of
galvanized iron, and their children be con-
demned to walk several miles to a galvanized-
iron school in an airless hollow, where some
asinine surveyor located it a quarter of a
century before ?
Meanwhile the selection of the first thou-
sand families would be in process of organi-
sation and development. Our new and
imaginary Government would have no
haggling or uncertainty on either side. First-
rate people would be offered material ad-
vantages. Amongst these would be a ready-
to-occupy dwelling with enough cleared and
cultivable land to yield a living from the
outset, means of communication and trans-
port, and an assured future. On the Govern-
ment side of the transaction would be in-
cluded as essential, physical and mental fit-
ness of a high order, some practical know-
ledge of the work to be done, willingness
and ability to give military service when
called on, and a business-like agreement to
remain for a specified terms of years, and to
pay back cost of improvements in return for
freehold rights or long lease. The whole
arrangement for selection would require to
be made proof against interested or merely
imbecile interference. The actual settle-
ment on the. land would be carried out under
close supervision, and the subsequent wealth
and welfare of the new population carefully
watched over. There is no suggestion of
grandmotherliness or spoon-feeding in such
a scheme. The Territorians of the future
must be regarded as valuable live stock, as
well as Australian oitizens of a particularly
important kind. They should not be per-
mitted to exercise the inherent British right
of depreciating their value to the State.
**• ♦ *
Once in being, the maintenance and de-
velopment of such a settlement, would be a
straightforward matter of business manage-
ment, provided that it were safeguarded
from party meddling. The necessary
capable men could easily be selected from
Australia, without any need to go to Scot-
land or elsewhere. The smouldering enmity
between British importatio-.s and mere
blawsted. colonials, which is so unpleasantly
evident in the higher branches of the army
and navy should not be repeated. The
settlement of the Territory is Australia’s
own job, and Australia’s own salvation de-
pends on the efficiency and expedition with
which it is done.—Yours, etc., Petek Culex.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Law or Lynch.
Fob another long vegetarian week N.S.W.’s
Premier buzzed around darkly, in friendly
consultation with law-breakers, and
struggled to persuade other people to give
way to them. The fact that the breakers
are mostly of his own political party doesn’t
make the position look any better. In fact,
it makes the position look (and smell) a
great deal worse. The question that is now
before the community is whether it is the
privilege of any or every considerable body of
Holman’s supporters to break the law with
impunity. Another form of the question is
whether the law is a steady-going machine,
or a mere erratic affair to be enforced when
Holman pleases, and not enforced when
Holman doesn’t please. A third form is
whether the country is to be ruled by lynch
law or by some more orderly method? Lynch
law sometimes hangs the right man, but
it is a dangerous, disorderly affair, and a
thing to be avoided. It was to get rid of
it in industrial affairs that Arbitration and
Conciliation Courts, and Wages Boards, and
the like, were established, and the justifiable
applause with which Holman and co.
greeted this great advance in civilisation is
applauding even unto this day. Unluckily
there are now more strikes than usual in
N.S.W. The statute isn’t necessarily to
blame, for the best of statutes is of no
earthly use unless it is enforced. This rule
applies even to the Ten Commandments.
The Holman Government has laid it down,
in effect, if not in words, that the industrial
enactments won’t be enforced against the
party from which it draws its support. The
shifty Premier dare not say that the
principle of industrial law as a sub-
stitute for industrial lynch is bad;
it is a great deal too late for even
the maddest Tory to say anything like
that openly, and besides Holman couldn’t
say it without shutting down on the' party
programme, and on all the beautiful ap-
plause that he and his crowd have thrown
at themselves. He certainly dare not say
that he has spoiled a splendid principle by
the lamentably bad method of its application.
Yet the whole case for every N.S.W. strike
is that either Holman’s courts don’t give
justice, or else that Holman’s system is so
silly and stupid and cumbersome, and so
much occupied in falling over its own feet,
that it doesn’t supply justice in reasonable
time. And Holman, instead of enforcing
his own law, or making a new law that he
won’t be ashamed to enforce, spends his days
negotiating with one series of law-breakers
after another, as if he were a petty commis-
sion agent instead of the head of the great
Ma State. He suggests the marine engineer
who pushes the ship along by hand because
he doesn’t know enough to grease or repair
the engines, or the wretched old Victorian
Ministry which “negotiated” with John
Wren, like one Great Power holding con-
verse on equal terms with another, for the
surrender of the notorious Collingwood
“tote,” instead of bursting open the door and
arresting all concerned. Of course, the Tory
press doesn’t speak very unkindly about
these things. It doesn’t say anything more
disagreeable than is really necessary. It
doesn’t really want Holman to cease drag-
ging the Conciliation and Arbitration prin-
ciple in the dirt and advertising the futility
of his own methods. When the butcherv
employees treat him with scorn, and tell
him, in effect, that his industrial devices are
no use to man or beast, none of his oppo-
nents strongly object. They like to see
Holman treated that way by his own
crowd. It suggests a rift in the lute, and
they wouldn’t repair the lute on any
account. And every day that Sydney went
short of meat because Holman’s law was
apparently incapable of making a satis-
factory, end of a very petty quarrel implied
a possible loss of votes. That also suited
the enemy well enough.

The Old Department Trotter.
There is little disguise about the fact that
the N.S.W. railways are to go back, in
some degree at least, to the muddle of the
days when every member of Parliament was
a boss, and dropped in to * a y how the lines
were to be managed, or to get a job for a
constituent, or to get a rise of pay for the
constituent who had a job already, or to for-
bid the discharge of an intoxicated constitu-
ent who had mixed up the signals. Minister
Hoyle put it in an indefinite fashion, like
a man who was half-ashamed, yet the posi-
tion was fairly clear: The Government, he
said, will nevec revert to the policy of “vest-
ing control of the railways and tramways
in one Commissioner.” Further, “it will
not interfere with details such as mainten-
ance and management, but it will not allow
the expressed will of the people and the
policy of the Government to be perverted by
one man.” Even through that polite haze
some meaning could be seen. I'ne Commis-
sioner doesn’t and can’t annul the expressed
will of the people and the policy of the
Government, for these can be fixed by law.
and the Commissioner has to obey the law
like everybody else, except meat-strikers and
people of that sort. Thus, when the party
now in power decided on a rise of wages
which added some £600,000 a year to the
pay-sheet, the hostile Johnson had simply
to cave in. There isn’t so much as a sem-
blance of difficulty about enforcing the will
of the people. But the Government can’t,
for very shame, pass Acts every day directing
that a billet shall be found for Smith’s con-
stituent, or that Brown’s constituent shall
get a rise, or that Jones’s constituent —he
having made an ex parte statement to
Jones that he wasn’t drunk when on duty,
and having threatened, unless his account of
the matter is believed, to work against
Jones at next election —shall be apologised
to and re-instated. A certain low type of
department-trotting politician or “good local
member,” being of no earthly value in large
affairs, used to hold his job solely by reason
of his capacity for working concessions for
his supporters in the Lands and Works, and
getting them billets in the Railways and the
Police. One man, according to a pleasant
legend, carried the business so far that he
lost his seat; he had a spell as a Minister
and made so many of his constituents police-
men, and put them on beats in Sydney, that
there weren’t enough left at home to secure
his re-election. The N.S.W. Public Service
Board isn’t a very beautiful affair, but the
interference of department trotting politi-
cians made something of the sort necessary.
The short-memoried public probably forgets
the inquiry that was held half-a-generation
asro into the Lands Office, and the rage of
the community when it learned that politi-
cians’ appointees had become so numerous
that for dozens of them there was neither
work nor space nor desks nor office stools,
and in consequence large squads had to take
turns at fishing or playing billiards on full
salary. _ And the powers of the Railway
Commissioner were largely increased because
of the same sort of trouble, though he never,
by any possible manner of foolishness, got
a chance to “pervert” the will of the people
or the policy of the Government. He has
to obey every order which reaches him
openly by Act of Parliament —that is to say,
every order that can stand inspection.
The only possible change, so far as the
ordinary man can see, is a reversion, more
or less complete, to the department-trotting
ways. Of these N.S.W. had a small sample
in recent times at Cockatoo Dock, when
members, and Ministers went down person-
ally to interfere in matters concerning 6d.
alleged to be due for “dirt money.” The
present system doubtless hurts the pride of
the small politician, and it tears him away
from a valuable corruption fund, but that
appears the best possible reason for its con-
tinuance.
Port Phillip Pond.
The fact that Melbourne will soon be un-
approachable to the biggest ships was aired
again by Admiral Patey when the local
Gaud Mayor presented him with an address
last week. Patey explained that the Aus-
tralia battleship, in a fully-equipped state,
drew 30ift. of water, and he wouldn’t run
the risk of putting the valuable property
through the channel at Port Phillip Heads
until it had been lightened of 2ft. weight of
fuel and ammunition. In short, the present
flagship of the Australian Navy must keep
gway from Port Phillip when fully equipped.
The next flagship will presumably be in-
capable of entering the Heads under any
circumstances, and the huge mailboats and
cargo steamers of the future will make no
mention of Melbourne on their time-tables.
What blighted the prospects of Geelong in
the past, as regards shipping trade and the
commerce appertaining thereto, is threaten-
ing to “queer the pitch” of the Victorian
capital in the near future. Widening and
deepening, the entrance cannot postpone
the inevitable for many years. If the biggest
ships of to-day are the most profitable to
their owners common sense suggests that
they had better be five times bigger, or more
so. Melbourne, having no natural right to
be Victoria’s principal seaport, should begin
to think of itself as a has-been and look
away from its mirror for a more durable
champion. Admiral Patey warns Mel-
bourne that it is losing its punch, in a com-
parative way of speaking.
♦
The Reduction to Absurdity of the
Strike.
A dispute that speedily developed the
usual “strike” happened at Victoria’s State
shipbuilding yard at Williamstown the other
day. The trouble arose over the customary
small boy, who, being engaged as a boiler-
maker’s apprentice, was put to do certain
simple work in the shipwrights’ shop or loft.
The shipwrights, who allege that a lot of
recently-engaged employees, both men and
boys, are immigrants, perceived in this an
attempt to insert the thin end of the wedge


of their supercession. So they shed their
tools and went along to interview |]ag el-
thorn, Minister of Public Works. Hage
thorn received them coldly, remarking that
no matter how great their grievance, they
should have interviewed him first, and struck
afterwards, if necessary. He also pointed
out that there was an Industrial Disputes
Committee attached to the: Trades Hail,
which should have been consulted, and he
further mentioned that, for 50 allegedly sane,
grown-up men to deliberately throw them-
selves out of work, over an argument as to
the kind of toil one small boy was to do,
amounted to a deliberate casting of mud on
the whole strike method. He remarked,
finally, that the State shipyard, though run
on union lines, without a suspicion of sweat-
ing, was designed, primarily, for the advan-
tage of the people of the whole State, and
not as a sort of Government relief work tor
boilermakers, shipwrights, etc., and that, 'C
it's owners were to be hampered in their
efforts to make it pay expenses by strikes
over such absurd trifles, they would presently
close it down. Which was sound sense from
start to finish. The absurdly fractious
toiler is becoming not merely a jest, but a
public nuisance. Only a few days before
the Williamstown episode the State mine
at Wonthaggi bad been kept idle—and losing
money—for some time over the dismissal of
one lad, a wheeler, and if the fearsome
“strike” record of that institution is to be
repeated at the State shipyard, the latter’s
end is only a matter of time. There are
(piite a number of people—none of them
Laborites or trade unionists —who would be
overjoyed to see one or both of these under-
takings abandoned, wherefore it is up to
advocates of State Socialism to do what they
can to help them along—even at the cost of
having to watch a small boy do something
that another small boy might be doing.
The Women Speak.
The annual Conference of the Australasian
Women’s Association occurred in Melbourne
last week, and syphilis was one of the first
matters to come up for discussion. The
President-in-Chief was inclined, at the out-
set, to be mildly apologetic. The subject,
she said, “might be considered inappropriate
for women to discuss.” However,
irom personal experience she knew that at least two
lectures on this question had been free of anything
objectionable, and she was sure the matter was one
that every girl should know much of before entering
into the bonds of matrimony, as in many cases the
innocent suffered for the guilty,
had after that the Conferences waded into
the question in no hesitant spirit. They
decided that the Watt Government should be
approached with a view to an amendment of
the law, so as to prevent the marriage of
those considered unfit for parentage, and a
motion was also passed that all venereal
diseases should be made compulsorily noti-
fiable. The conservative, male and female,
will be bound to utter a short, sharp howl
expressive of scandalised astonishment, grief,
etc., at the drastic nature of these recom-
mendations. The same sort of person uttered
a similar sort of howl, when compulsory
service, and a White Australia, and alien
immigration restriction laws were first
mooted. It is what may be termed a stock
howl; one that is always employed, irre-
spective of the merits of the proposal under
consideration, at more or less regular and
short intervals, and, in the nature of things,
it merits little consideration. The chief
argument advanced in opposition to com-
pulsory notification is that such a thing
would be an “outrage,” arid that “the pub-
lic” would, accordingly, decline to stand it.
The same vague objection is lodged against
the prevention of the union of the
mentally or morally unfit. Why should
the State consider the feelings of those
who contract, say, syphilis—to the extreme
peril of all those others with whom they
may come in contact —when it makes no
pretence of paying the slightest attention to
the feelings of those who are smitten with
small-pox, or leprosy, or diphtheria, or
plague? At the moment of writing the
N. S. Wales police are searching with
feverish energy for a one-eyed man. He is
a leper. If they find him, and he attempts
to evade them, he will be seized and gaoled
as vigorously as though he had done a mur-
der. In any event he is doomed, on apiire-
hension, to put in the remainder of his days
at a State lazarette. The venereal sub-
ject may, conceivably, be just as dangerous
as a leper. The only apparent argument in
favor of the venereal sufferer being allowed
to remain at large, and freely infect others,
is based on the fact that he is so extraor-
dinarily numerous. The leper has to be
pursued with a .fine tooth-comb; the plague
patient is an infrequent horror, even when
the disease is prevalent; but the syphilitic
is everywhere—and for that reason, in the
opinion of a large section, should be im-
mune from compulsory treatment. It is
tantamount to claiming that the fire brigade
should not assail a really big fire, merely on
account of its size. As a matter of fact,
the resolutions passed by the Women’s Con-
ference have become law in other parts of
the world.' Several American States have
compulsory notification; and the State of
New York has a Prevention of Procreation
Act, which provides for a Board (consisting
of a surgeon, a neurologist, and a practi-
tioner of medicine, each with at least 10
years’ experience), which Board is empow-
ered to examine criminals; decide whether
or no the latter are likely to produce chil-
dren with an inherited leaning towards
crime or insanity; and if so operate upon
them with a view to preventing them from
begetting children. Criminals of the
Phillips type also come within the opera-
tion of this law —men, that is to sav. “who
have been convicted of rape, or of such suc-
cession of offences against the criminal law
as in the opinion of the Board shall be
deemed sufficient evidence of confirmed crim-
inal tendencies.” Under the new Marriage
Law of Pennsylvania licenses to marry are
issued only to persons who are not afflicted
with a transmissable disease', and who are
neither imbecile, epileptic, or physically or
mentally unable to support a family. These
changes have been derided; and they will
be derided a lot more, doubtless, before they
become in ahy way general. But their
dav is alreadv at hand. It is as much the logical
duty of Society to protect itself against
one avoidable calamity as another. Syphilis
—preminentl.v the disease which blasts the
lives of innocent people—has no valid claim
to immunity from assault because it has
been termed absurdly the “disease of shame.”
And now that the women —the section of the
community which has hitherto displayed
more false modesty in this regard than any
other —are beginning to discuss it as frankly
almost as they might discuss influenza, even
its old bulwark of being an unmentionable
thing, promises to be torn from it.
The Neglected Gold Mine.
The Holman Government, which, just
now, is a sort of Domain dosser amongst
State Governments, evolved last week a
number of schemes to get more or less
straight financially—schemes which won’t
bring in a vast amount of revenue but which
will certainly exasperate the electors to a
marked extent. And meanwhile there is no
audible mention of a scheme that must sim-
ply coin money for the State from the
moment it is inaugurated, and that will
annoy no one worth the consideration of a
Labor Administration. It is truly astonish-
ing to see a modern Government, with the
experience of decades behind it, humbugging
round with proposals to reimpose the Id.
impost on cheques and charge an extra half-
penny on the tramways’ second sections,
while coldly neglecting the vast field of re-
venue that would be available from the
institution of the totalisator. The extra
penny on the cheque and the additional
half-penny on the tram will not bring in
more than a couple of hundred thousand
per annum between them. Compare
with that figure the majestic sum that must
accrue from the introduction of the tote.
Paris supports its hospitals and pays a
goodly proportion of its municipal charges
out of Tote profits. Sydney doesn’t spend
quite so much on racing as Paris, but it
spends a great deal one way and another.
If the N.S.W. Government, instead of tak-
ing the customary per pent, of Tote
profits for itself and allowing the clubs 74,
took 5 per cent, and allowed the clubs 5
per. cent., the local earnings would be as
considerable almost as those anywhere. The
proposition is equitable enough. The metro-
politan clubs are absurdly affluent already,
and they would continue to be affluent even
if they were allowed a mere 5 per cent, of
the Tote takings. Why is the obvious thus
persistently avoided, and slurred over, and
in general treated as though it didn’t exist?
Why are Tote Commissions appointed,
and instructed to discover everything pos-
sible on the subject, regardless of mere sor-
did expense, and why, after they have
unearthed nothing detrimental to the Tote
and a host of things in its favor, do they
dissolve suddenly with a smell as of some-
thing long dead? Why will no N. S. Wales
Government, Liberal or Labor, touch the
Tote with a 40ft. pole, in a manner of speak-
ing? The answer to all these problems is
bound up, chiefly, in the identical circum-
stance that makes the Tote a desirable
State enterprise. The fact is, the class
which has most to lose by the arrival of the
Tote —the bookmaking class —has too much
money. The bookmakers are on such a
remarkably good wicket while the Tote re-
mains in abeyance, that it is worth their
while to spend small fortunes with the
object of keeping it in abeyance. They
would spend large fortunes, if necessary, but
it is their good luck that on any given Tote
Commission, and in any given Parliament,
there are numbers of people who don’t need
to be squared. They are devil’s advocates
in the name of righteousness. They barrack
for the of-the horse-stiffener and the
jockey-squarer and the tick-tacker, and the
rest of the unsavory racecourse crew which
owes its existence to the bookmaking sys-
tem, on the ground that the system in ques-
tion represents the Better Way. A strong
Government, if it also happened to be a
Government that knew its business, would
turn down unhesitatingly both the foolish
Wowsers who oppose the introduction of the
Tote for no arguable reasons whatever, and
rhe venal emissaries of the “books.” who
fisrht the Tote, in and out of Parliament f«r

that the State requires.

Trusts and Beef in the Territory.
“Vigilans” writes: —
The Union Cold Storage Co., which says it’s Eng-
lish, but probably mentions it through its nose, has
brought out Corley and Patterson in. East Kim-
berley and the Buchanan estate on the Victoria River,
Northern Territory. The country comprises the Ond,
Margaret and Sturt Rivers (something like 9,000,000
acres) and Wave Hill station (6,000,640 acres). A
representative is about to visit Melbourne with the
object of getting concessions from the Government
for the purpose of erecting freezing works on the
Victoria River. The Victoria River is not only the
best waterway in the North, but the adjacent lands
are the finest in the Territory for either pastoral or
agricultural purposes. The fodders are not rank
as they are in the neighborhood of Port Darwin, Port
Essington, Blue Mud Bay or the McArthur, because
the rainfall is much lighter. This is the country
where settlement should first take place—this and
the McArthur, which is the natural outlet for oyer
40,000 square miles of the finest downs in Australia,
where millions of sheep could be depastured and very
fine wool grown.
The Victoria penetrates farther into the interior
than any other river on the North Coast. Its mouth is
26 miles wide between Turtle and Pierce Points,
while it is navigable for large steamers for a dis-
tance of 50 miles from the sea, and for 60 miles far-
ther by lin-ht-draft craft.
All the best country is, unfortunately, held in vast
lumps by corporations or private individuals on long
leases at Is. a square mile. There are, in most cases,
33 years still to run. The areas comprise small nrin-
cipaliti'es of six, seven and ten thousand square miles.
It is said the Union Co. is also after Victoria Downs
—Kidman’s station—and it would probably not be
a difficult thing to buy out Joe Bradshaw. Then
the co. would have a monopoly of the river. That
would not benefit the Territory much, nor would it
cause much settlement.

The Sort of Relic that is a Standing
Danger.
Last week the Commonwealth airmen made
a series of flights near Melbourne. They
used the old Bristol biplanes that were im-
ported here from England over a year ago.
According to a pressman onlooker: —
Lieutenant Harrison took Brigadier-General
Gordon as a passenger, but the low power machine
was not equal to the task, and for about five miles
was only skimming the ground or diving towards it.
The spectators gasped at each sudden dip, till at last
Harrison brought the machine to earth, and General
Gordon alighted.
Then Lieutenant Harrison made a fine flight, but
as he was about to complete his display by vol-
planing to earth, the machine ran into a pocket, and
dived to within a few feet of the roadway. Harrison
said afterwards that he could not feel the seat under
him, and was wondering whether he or the aeroplane
would reach earth first, when the machine, unex-
pectedly recovered itself.
There is nothing in the world that becomes
obsolete so quickly as an aeroplane. The
man who, at this time of day, ventured to
ascend in the brand of machine which Colin
Defries brought to Australia a few years
ago, would be regarded as a suicidal maniac.
Defries, to do him justice, never attempted
to make a flight in his engine of death. He
was satisfied to garb himself in the pictur-
esaue leathern costume of the confirmed occu-
pant of high altitudes, stand about impres-
sively in the neighborhood of his plane;
objurgate the local atmosphere; and then go
thoughtfully home. Hart, the Australian
flier, was the genuine article. He really
knew; also he flew. Regardless alike of the
alleged thinness of the atmosphere, the
hideous force of the north-east winds, and the
horrible possibility of a southerly smiting
him when he was in mid-air, this young man
persistently ascended almost daily for many
months. In due course the extremely
probable occurred, and he nearly killed him-
self. Any modern airman who went up in
the Hart bi-plane, as it was a couple of
years ago, would rather expect to get killed
or thereabouts, just as any motorist who went
touring in a really old-time make of car would
rather expect to get stuck up. It is a fair
proposition to lay it down that, in the matter
of efficiency, as a modern car is to a car of 12
years ago, so a modern aeroplane is to one
of 12 months back. Countless devices for the
ensuring of safety have been patented dur-
ing the past year. If any of them has been
annlied to the painfully sensational machine
which was used last week by airman Harri-
son, the country has yet to learn about the
matter. Being designed for purposes of
instruction it should be expected, as a first
essential, to be competent to carry a passen-
ger. Yet it was admittedly unequal to the
job. Apparently it can’t sustain the burden
even of a pilot with any sort of security from
disastei*. It is hopelessly false economy to
cheesepare in this particular direction. A
brand-new aeroplane with every modern
improvement —a Rolls-Royce or PjercE-
Arrow amongst flying-machines —would cost
little as Defence departments understand
the term. Its acquisition by the military
authorities might avert the death of an air-
man, whose family would presumably
become a permanent charge on the State, or
of a valuable general or other soldier, or both.
The luckless airmen whose duty it is to fly
the pre-historic craft which the Government
has placed at their disposal cannot make
any protest. It is a rule of the military
game that they should acclaim the aged
death-traps as thoroughly safe and satisfac-
tory in every way. But unquestionably
there is something gravely wrong with an
instructional biplane whose power is so low
that it can only “skim the ground or dive
towards it” ; and that being so, it should be
scrapped. Only the best ought to be good
enough for Australia in this connection.
♦
Dutch Geologist J. van Watersciioat van
der Graciit kindly told Brisbaneites the
other day :
It is impossible to ever develop the Northern
Territory without colored labor. The white man will
perhaps do well for a few years, but after that his
constitution will be absolutely ruined. . . .There has
never been an example in human history where
white men could do hard labor in the tropics. It is
an absolutely new thing that Australia wants to try.
The van Watersciioat person is surely a
man of great ignorance. It might be said
with much greater truth that there was never
an example in human history where white
men failed to do hard labor in the tropics.
Certainly, human history is very new, and
it hasn’t many records to go upon. Also, a
lot of pompous Saddletrees and Pumble-
ciiooks haven’t read even the scanty records
that there are, and only know that there
are white men in Britain and Germany and
Holland, while they have heard that there
are niggers on the Congo. In their opinion
that is the complete history of the world.
But it isn’t. The Egyptian, as distinguished
from the nigger who has come into Egypt,
is white. So are the Persian and his small
brother, the Parsee, of Bombay and there-
abouts ; and some of the tribes of the
Sahara. The Boer in the tropics remains
white and vigorous, and the white Queens-
lander doesn’t become a son of Ham. The
Assyrian was a white man in a hot country,
and so was (and is) the Jew. Anybody who
called the Jew a black man would get his
overdraft called up in short order. On the
other side of the case, the aborigines of
Tasmania and non-tropical Australia are
black ; the Maori is brown; the Kaffir and
Hottentot of South Africa are murky; the
frozen person of Tierra del Fuego is nearly
black) also the still more frozen person of
Alaska and Northern Canaria is very dark
brown. The nigger of England is the North
Sea fisherman. He is generally darker than
the Persian or the Egyptian, but the cus-
tomary explanation in his case is that he is
“weatherbeaten.”
; *—
From “R.M.” : The Vic. centralisation crowd
—which is to say the Melbourne property-
owners and their heelers —lodged bitter pro-
tests when the differential rates on the local
railways were abolished; or, to put it with
more accuracy, when they seemed to have
been abolished. By the present of
things the reform was largely a fake. Con-
sider. for example, the Vic. departmental
railway circular (issued 5/2/’l4), which
deals with the charges that are piled up —
obviously in lieu of differential rates —on
the Casterton-Hamilton-Warrnambool-Ararat
line. After setting forth the official time-
table, the circular goes on: —
in addition to the ordinary freight a charge of
2s. 6d. per mile, or part thereof, for the light run-
ning of each train from Ararat to Hamilton is to be
made, with an additional charge of 50s. for each
train crew to cover the expenses whilst away from
their home station.
The “light-running” charge of 2s. 6d. a rpile
for each train from Ararat to Hamilton
664 miles —works out at £l6 12s. 6d. for the
two trains. Also it is impudent humbug.
The trains in question don’t run as two
trains, but as a single “doubl'e-header” train.
Also they run as ordinary goods trains, and
as well-loaded ones at that. Out of the
50s. charge for expenses for each train crew
the men get, in reality, 30s. The Lord
alone knows where the superfluous quid
goes —mayhap to help pay the extra 6d. per
day which the Vic. John Hop is to get from
next July onwards. Obviously these charges
are imposed in order to discourage traffic to
Warrnambool, and direct it to good old Mel-
bourne. It is a disreputable sort of busi-
ness all round and pleasing to none but
those who want to see Melbourne values
inflated artificially at the expense of the
State at large.
“Croson” delves into Figures:—
Statistician Knibbs. whose aim and business is to
give the public whatever information his figures
afford, regardless of the consequences, has published
an interesting table showing the cost of living in 30
centres of the Commonwealth during the last quarter
of ’l3. As might have been expected, Kalgoorlie is
the most expensive place to dwell in at present, its
figure 'being 235. 4d. as compared with 205., the
average of the Commonwealth. Eeaconsfield (Tas.)
14s. 7d. and Zeehan (Tas.) 16s. 9d. are the cheapest.
Other places hover around the golden mean,
though the various States differ considerably—
Westralia and N.SAV. averaging- 21s. 6d. ;
S. Aus., 20s. ; Vic., 18s. lid. ; Tas., 18s. 7d. ;
and Bananaland 18s. The cost of food ranges
from the 17s. 6d. of Kalgoorlie (IV. A.) to the
10s. lid. of Ballarat (Vic.) and Mt. Gambier (S.A.) ;
but rent accounts for many of the discrepancies—
Sydney, 9s. Bd.; Melbourne, Bs. 6d.; Adelaide, Bs.
sd. ; Hobart, 6s. lid. ; Brisbane, 6s. lOd. ; Beacons-
field, 2s. ; Zeehan, 2s. lid. ; Charters Towers and
Wallaroo, 4s. 7d. ; Ballarat, 4s. lOd. Another re-
turn of Knibbs’ shows how a large proportion of the
increased cost of living occurs. Taking 20s. as a
standard Commonwealth average of rent paid in 1911,
the figures show that rents have risen, between I9QI
and 1913 in Sydney from 17s. 3d. to 255. 6d. ; in
Melbourne from 14s. Bd. to 225. Id. ; in Brisbane
from 9s. 9d. to 17s. lOd. ; in Perth from 16s. to 18s.
lid., and in Hobart from 13s. 4d. to 18s. Only in
Adelaide has there been a break in the steady rate of
increase; there rents rose from 12s. 7d. in 1901 to
235. sd. in the second quarter of ’l2 ; since then they
have steadilv dropped to 21s 10s. The Brisbane
landlord is the shocking example, yet, notwithstand-
ing his rapacity. Queensland is still the least expen-
sive State i’i the Commonwealth and Brisbane the
cheapest capital.
Business on Fraternal (Freetrade) Lines
and Our Glorious Destiny.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Our association,” said Dr. Snowdon, “is really a
gigantic Chamber of Commerce, and the largest and
most powerful organisation of its kind in the world.
Its ideal is to promote business the world over on
fraternal lines. We can buy a lot from Australasia,
and we are a manufacturing country. At the same
time, we do not wish to say a word against your
protective ideas regarding duties; but we suggest
that possibly you are making a mistake in imposing
a protective duty on things you don’t produce.
“It will be magnificent,” said Dr. Snowdon, “if
something can be brought to fruition in the way of
the opening up of great avenues of trade on both
sides. From what we understand already, your
wonderful notentialities are a regular staggerer, and
we do think that it will be a mistake on your part
to tighten the commercial strings too much so that
you cannot do anything.”
—Sydney Telegraph interview.
“Say, doc.,” remarked the Sydney Tele-
graph reporter
(We’ll call him Snorter),
“You sure are some daisy—l mean, dahlia ;
What tcouldl/ou like us to do in Australiaf”
And the Doc. took a chew or two —but we
are uncertain whether it was gum or
tobacco he chewed upon—and said;
“Wal, say ; guess we—-that is Us and Our
’Sociation —
And you may say that that means the whole
gol-darned ’Murkan nation —-
We are right here to do bizness, and get you
bested,
But, of course, we are e-tarnally disin-
, t’rested.
We are here in the name of Uncle Sam and
not to kick up any blamed shines;
’Cds why? ’Cos your Uncle believes in pro-
moting bizness on fraternal lines.
Yes, sir! That’s Us —also our ’Sociation,
Which you may say comprises the en-tire
1 caboodle of— hum! —manoofact’rers in
the nation!”
“But, look a-liere, doc.,” resumed once again
that energetic and inquisitive reporter—-
(Who, in the absence of any specific informa-
tion to the contrary, or otherwise, we
have agreed to designate Snorter)
“On what lines do you propose to do biz-
ness?”
And the Doc. smote the water with his ex-
pectoration thrice from the weather-
rail, and replied :
“Wal, naow, that’s dead easy ;
You fellers down here in this little, old burg
needn’t get oueasy,
Our ’Sociation of the Amalgamated Trusts,
Manufacturers, Boodlerakers and Ex-
perts—
The everlastingest Big Thing—so Big that
when it kicks I kin assure you it hurts!
Our ’Sociation intends for to exercise its un-
parallelled and spontaneous activities;
Likewise to minister to your wants. and
humor your little importing proclivities;
By seeing that you are supplied in absolutely
unlimited quantities and numbers
With real, dyed-in-the-wool Amurkan manu-
factures ; meantime, of course, your
Government jest slumbers !”
“My” remarked that appreciative reporter,
“that idea’s a boshter—a real beauty!”
“Yep,” said the gratified Doctor Snowball ;
“and look a-here, mind your doggoned
patriotic Australians don’t get a-puttin’
on a duty.”
“Duty!” shrieked the horrified,’ loyal, free-
trading SNORTER.
“Why, Doc., the Sydney Telegraph hates
duties like the Devil is said to hate holy
worter.
Duty? My dear doc., don’t you worry; nor
your Association.
You just pile in all the manufactures you
can into this young and magnificent
Nation
Which the Almighty has put here to grow
meat and skins and muttons,
Also wool and butter for your great country,
and especially your Association, to turn
into cloth and leather and buttons ;
Don’t you worry about duty; the Sydney
Telegraph, which I have the honor to
represent —
Which, in short, is the leading journal (or
says it is), and which me to you cordi-
ally sent.
In order to get your instructions as to the
conduct of Australia —and our treat-
ment of your Association —
The Telegraph, it it can, will secure of all
duties the prompt cancellation !”
“In that case,” remarked the mollified Doc-
tor, “seeing that you know your place,
and that your people recognise that no-
body may manufacture but US ;
We’ll do bizness ;
Have a segar?. . . .
Do tell, but this yere xlustralia is a most
amoosin’ little cuss!”

When a suburban flapper falls in love
with Hugh Buckler, her father, a successful
hussex-street hay and turnip pirate, appeals
to Mr. Buckler to disillusionise the girl. The
Sussex-street. produce buccaneer has other
views for his daughter—the other views
being the horsey nephew of a successful
draper, who, on the death of his uncle, will
succeed to the whole drapery and inherit the
cheap sale. The father of the flapper at
first offers to double the wages of the star
actor, for life, on condition that he leaves
the game and the Commonwealth immedi-
ately. But no actor can be bribed, even at
over-time rates for life, to give up his art.
However, Hugh Buckler, having nobly re-
fused his old-age pension, or flapper-bonus,
proves generous. He undertakes himself,
without pay, to disillusionise the matinee-
hero worshipper. The easiest way, of
course, would be to ask her to Actors’ Day
at the White City. But he invites himself
to supper—and finds that the girl he had
to disillusionise is the unknown maiden that
he has fallen in love with. However, he
keeps, under great provocation, to his con-
tract, and behaves, while pretending to be
drunk, so outrageously, that the disen-
chanted flapper orders him from the house.
But then she learns that her actor has only
been acting, and after that, despite an un-
necessary duel, the lovers are united in the
unhurried kiss that continues till the curtain
drops.
* * * *
That, modernised, is the plot of Tom
Robertson's comedy, “David Garrick.” The
Sydney Little Theatre company revels in the
rough-and-tumble of this old farce. The
hero Hugh Buckler, is robustiously and de-
lightfully drunk. He makes, too, a gallant
and convincing figure in his moments of
emotion. Kenneth Brampton, as Squire
Chivey, presents another aspect of drunken-
ness with admirable effect. In character
parts this actor is one of the finest now in
Sydney. Reginald Wykeham plays on
straight lines the stolid father, contriving
to make him a dignified and likeable old
man. Miss Violet Paget has little to do but
to look adorable and shocked. She has no
trouble in doing either. The other charac-
ters, all caricatured figures of farce, are
capably presented by Arthur Cornell, Miss
lempe Pigott, Miss Lilian Lloyd, Alfred
Bnstowe and Harry Halley. The staging
is painstakingly of. or about, the period.
For those who find the intellectual drama
rather tiring, this revival of a celebrated
comedy will come as a relief. The innova-
tion of a dainty variety turn by Miss Eva
lruman, who sings charmingly a number of
clever songs before the curtain rises, proves
entirely acceptable to the Little Theatre
patrons.
* * * *
The Sydney Adelphi is still doing good
business with the Niggerville bellowdrama,
‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” and still better busi-
ness with the incidental rag-time numbers.
Tp date there are no signs of the supply
ot burnt cork giving out or of the black
slaves striking, but when anything serious
does happen and Thomas can’t carry on,
Miss Nellie Fergusson will reappear with
‘something new” (see ad.), entitled “Allah’s
Orchard.”
Another statuary turn gives the Sydney
Tivoli programme a pretty hefty lift this
week. A posing game these days has to be
very well done to take on, and the new one,
by the Golden Athlones, gets there from the
jump. The Two Bobs. Tom Davis trio,
Waterbury Bros, and Tenney and Tucker
make the best imnressions among the other
turns. Harry Thaw’s escape from some
Yankee asylum is the subject of the moving-
picture item. Henry, by the way, presently
g?t back to the asylum, but that is another
flickergraph, so to speak.

Fred Niblo nightly demonstrates his cure
for heart-disease, or tonsilitis, or snake-bite,
or whatever it is he’s got, to interested audi-
ences at Sydney Criterion. In “Never Say

unwise to jump to conclusions. His name,
he mentions, was Charlotte two weeks before
he was born.

The trouble about the stage Great Man
is that he has to be continually talking to
himself, in order to let the audience know
how his wonderful brain is seething with
vast schemes and projects. This irresistibly
suggests that the Great Man is dotty and
unfit to be at large, and the exaggerated
respect which the other characters pay him
seems to indicate that they also are dotty;
in fact, the whole company seems to be ripe
tor the asylum, or dotty palace. “A Royal
Divorce,’ revived by Julius Knight and co„
at Sydney Royal last Saturday, is sprinkled
with soliloquies. Julius, as Napoleon, has
most of them. He is so great and so iso-
lated, and has got such cold feet on his
seethes so hard about
Hritish bulldogs” and other troublesome
matters, that he has to take himself aside
and have a few words with himself at very
short intervals. The Empress Josephine
breaks out at least once, and there may have
been other > breakages which this writer
missed. The play itself is a glorious fake
and a sugary fraud. The dramatist has
stood History on her head, taken all the
small change and loose characters that fell
out of her peggy-bag, and fled. Nobody who
takes a serious interest in the past should
see it, for if lie knows he will be annoyed,
and if he is hazy and indefinite (most of us
are hazy and indefinite) he will be confused.
Julius Knight looks like all the pictures of
Napoleon, and makes a sort of sling of his
waistcoat in the proper manner. He also
broods picturesquely and clasps his hands
behind liis back. It is a sawdusty part,
which might be nlayed by a dummy with
moveable arms and a phonograph attach-
ment with a record of the fusty “British
bulldogs” speech—which, by the way, is
“A ROYAL DIVORCE,” AT SYDNEY
ROYAL.
Whoa! Julius Napoleon Knight and his
dangerous charger.
applauded to the echo by all the British
bulldogs present. Knight goes from one
pose to another, and is very neat and busi-
nesslike. Miss Irby Marshall, as the stage
Josephine, started weakly on the first night,
but acted with more force in the later
scenes. Irene Browne makes a handsome
but somewhat pettish Marie Louise. Leslie
Victor (Talleyrand) vanishes early from the
play, leaving a pleasant impression of a
very little that has been very well done.
Eardley Turner (Grimaud) drinks enter-
tainingly for one scene. Emma Temple flits
graciously across the stage as nurse of the
infant King of Rome. Leonard Willey is
correct and stolid as the scheming Marquis
de Beaumont; and several other players do
nothing much. The inaccurate and highly
spectacular play is popular mush and seems
to have been specially devised to keep players
from doing anything worth while.
Since last time The Bulletin addressed
itself to Sydney White City, its old friend
Calvert, the wire-walker, has disappeared.
Whether he just went on walking through
space amongst the stars, or, descending to
earth, went round the corner to have a drop
o’ something, and never came back, this paper
knoweth not. It can only mourn his loss
and report that the Clark-Razzillian troupe
of trapeze performers is on his old pitch.

“The Land of Nod,” William Anderson’s
American medley show, has been attracting
considerable numbers of paying guests to the
Palace (Sydney) during the week. Since
the opening night the co. has got rid of some
of its stiffness in concerted dancing,
due no doubt to having become accus-
tomed to the cramped stage. There’s the
difference of an acre or so, or a squattage, or
a complete Old Dad’s selection in the sizes
of the stage at Melbourne King’s and the
Palace. Sister Nellie Quealy found this out
when leading the joyous songandance, “On
the Mississippi.” All the same she has been
bringing the house about her ears each night.
A gay and showy deaconess is Sister Quealy
in that ragtime psalm.

Ihere is a batch of new people at the

bright, small coons who sing and dance much

are well propped up by the supporting co.

chorus during the last production of “Autumn
Manoeuvres’’ in Sydney, and carolling an inci-
dental number in a beautiful though some-
what uncultivated voice, gave the customary
farewell concert at the Town Hall on Mon-
day night. He has been studying with
Andrew Black, and is leaving shortly to com-
plete the good work in Italy. He owns a
lyric tenor of great volume and sympathy,
and it has been developed by Black to a
marked extent. Also a number of the ragged
edges have been sawn off it, and its excres-
cences have been flattened down. The
“Prize Song” from “Die Meistersingers,”
was astonishingly good; on the other hand,
his interpretation of a Verdi number was
astonishingly amateurish. Take him for all
in all the new export should do his country
credit in foreign parts.
The Revue is dying in the night at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney. It is also dying in the
afternoon at periodical matinees. The old,
in the form of some of the mouldiest chest-
nuts known to vaudeville, is being rung out.
In another 10 days the more or less new is
billed to arrive, and “Come Over Here,”
with its plank, its tank and its show girls,
will move on to Melbourne.

Catering for the public amusement is
notoriously a gamble, and Mclntosh (“with
him,” as the lawyers say, Portus) has
struck an unexpected winner at Adelaide
Tivoli. That city did not seem a too pro-
mising scene for Tango Teas, yet they were
an immediate success. Any forecast of their
indiscretion—as there conducted —was only
rumor;, one has seen worse things at a Sun-
day-school picnic. To the masculine mind,
the steady procession of ladies, fully dressed,
in elaborate underwear, is slightly weari-
some, and the audience tends more and more
to be feminine. The Tango dancing, by
Reade and Vivien Talleur, is interesting,
instructive and harmless. The King’s has
a good all-round bill, with Rellimi on the
accordeon, the dog Daisy on its hind legs,
and Albar the acrobat on his own. Nothing,
however, goes better than the turn of the
so-called Franco dwarfs, who carry off some
very ordinary conjuring with a pleasant and
assured manner that makes it go a long way.
The Dandies are still in the Town Hall, hav-
ing been driven there by the Show. They
are as clever as ever but somehow it is only
*, n th® °P en a^r that they seem to have their
full flavor. The picture-shows rely mainly
on strong “drama.” Wondergraph has an
effective burning train, and West’s a Jekyll
and Hyde story of the good man gone wrong,
as well as a life of Napoleon, brilliantly
faked. As for the Theatre Royal, you can’t
see it for dust—literally; but it promises
solemnly to be rebuilt again and open by
Easter Saturday.

From an Adelaide critic:—
H. S. Power used to be considered by Adelaide as
1 j °n™^ 0 L along with Heysen, Hayley Lever
and Will Ashton. He spent his most impressionable
years here, and the Adelaide Art Gallery gave him
his first commission. (Now he has been to England
and made a name, Victoria claims him as born
there.) His present show, at the Institute gallery,
gives both his earlier and his later manners. Of the
latter is his Fox Hunt, from the Royal Academy,
with various portraits of hounds and horses and children,
for which the country gentlemen of England are
understood to pay up with great readiness. The hounds
are especially delightful. Landscapes he does not
neglect. His fine, wide, cloud-and-sunshine Canberra
view is his best in sight in that line, and he has
numbers of smaller things, painstaking or sometimes
careless, to show. His idea of painting occasionally
in water-colors on canvas makes a technical difficulty
which he overcomes brilliantly.

The bitter cry of Mrs. Potiphar when her
eyesight is removed—by the way, where was
Mrs. P. when her light went out? —will be
heard no more at Melbourne Royal after
I riday week. The nights that draw their
tableaux curtains so frequently on “Joseph
and Ilis Brethren” are numbered. Persons
desirous of seeing the extreme lengths to
which a patriarch’s beard could grow in
Genesis must hurry up and put their glasses
on Jacob ere he takes his tribe to Sydney.
It is a wonderful array of face-foliage. The
fowls of the air could build their nests in
it, and Jacob wouldn’t know. Local barbers
resect it as a gross injustice to native in-
dustry. To the present writer, it has a
truly impressive bearing on the panto, at
Her Majesty’s, for when Athol wood (as
Uncle Baba) remembers the word that will
open the Robbers’ Cave and cries “Sesame!
By the beard of the Prophet, I have it!” this
scribe thinks of the hair appertaining to
Joseph’s awful Dad, and groans inwardly.

Gregan McMahon’s Repertory Co. will get
a look in at the Royal during the week
between the. departure of Joseph and the
return of Niblo. Two consecutive perform-
ances of Bernard Shaw’s comedy, “The Doc-
tor’s Dilemma.” and one consecutive produc-
tion Sowerby’s drama, “Rutherford and
Son, are the Repertory programme for
March 24-26. Faulkner Smith is in charge
of the gate-money department.
T 'C *l*
At Her Majesty’s, Melbourne, the panto,
is stated to be nearing the end of the season.
The 100th performance is due next week,
and the last night will probably happen this
month.
At Melbourne Kina’s the drama of the
unsober young man who turned from his
drinky ways is to be withdrawn on Friday,
when “The Ninety and Nine” will have
lasted three weeks. The Bert Bailey co. has
in view a Yankee farcical drama entitled
‘What Happened to Mary,” but before the
fate of Mary comes on for discussion a re-
vival of “On Our Selection” must run its
course. General Desire insists upon a revi-
val of Dad, Dave and co., and they will
bring their weird family affairs back to
notice on Saturday next (14tli).

The same evening Allen Doone will talk
and sing to his Nora as of yore in “Sweet
County Kerry.” For 11 nights thereafter'he
will warble of his devotion to Nora and Erin
in the same innocuous play, and then he
"l 1 love Erin some more in another piece
of Glorious News for the Irish. The Doone
season of Hibernian drama terminates early
next month, for on the 11th comes Harry
Lauder to the Melbourne Princess’s with a
vaudeville co. Owing to the expensiveness
of the braw little Scot with the big face, the
ordinary tariff of admission will rise to
105.6 d.. for reserved stalls and d.c. On the
11th aforesaid it will rise twice as high. Per-
sons desirous of booking seats for the first
night, prior to the opening of the box plan
to the public at large, are invited to send
their guineas to J. and N. Tait at the
Auditorium.

Three recitals of “Behind the Beyond,”
together with singing and violining by Miss
Caron and Norman Churton, will have trans-
pired at Melbourne Athenseum Hall ere next
Bulletin is born. Marcus St. John recites
the satirical play, and his musical colleagues
do the rest. The second appearance of the
entertainment is due on Saturday, and the
third on Tuesday next.

Opera’s House. Samuel differs from pre-
vious Hebrew character comedians in being
comparatively fresh and chippy, and his
medley song has something of original humor
in it, strange to say. Ellis, of Rose and
Ellis, extracts a new thrill or two from the
old, old business of barrel jumping, also the
boss expert of the Daunton-Shaw Troupe
contrives to be almost astounding as a trick
cyclist. But it is a hard job to excite won-
derment on a bike these times. Josephine
Davis, Talleur Andrews, the Graus, the

gerie accounts for two extra matinees a

“JOSEPH AND HIS BRETHREN," AT
MELBOURNE ROYAL.
Front row
on stage.
Probably Tango Teas were sent into the
world to be burlesqued. Branscombe’s Dan-
dies, at the airy theatre on St. Kilda. Esplan-
ade, are turning the Tango matindes to
account in their principal item. For the
rest of their programme they are much the
same unassuming exponents of song, dance
and concerted frivolity as they were when
their garments betrayed no signs of wear.
The weather has been kind to their show,
as a rule. For that matter, the show de-
serves all the consideration the fickle ele-
ments can give it.
The arrival of autumn in Melbourne’s
midst is marked by the announcement of
piano recitals to come. On the 18th Goll
starts a series of occasional outbreaks at the
Town Hall, and on the 21st Master Max
Pirani will reveal the alleged genius that is
in him by playing some of his own compo-
sitions at the Auditorium. A farewell benefit
concert is being organised for the occasion,
and all the local ladies with music and
fashions in their souls are conspiring to
make Max’s testimonial a bonza.
The extraction of evidence by means of
threats, insults and offensive conduct gener-
ally, is once more held up to contumely in
“The Third Degree,” at West’s Palace, Mel-
bourne. It is, of course, the biographic ver-
sion of Charles Klein’s drama, and it fea-
tures all the thrills of the great original,
barring the heated language of the policeman
who bounces young Jeffries into the confes-
sion of murder. The only other drama of
importance is “On the Great Steel Beam.”
It tells how Lombardi, the Dago, assiduously
nursed and fed his r-r-revenge and fell from
a great height in his endeavor to make it
earn the money that he had spent on its
keep.
Minister Griffith (N.S.W.) has been
speaking unkindly about the Broken Hill
Water Supply Co., and if he had had breath
to spare he might have said something at
least equally hostile about the little private
railway which connects the Hill with the
S.A. border. Both of these private enter-
prises (which, by the way, are not even
N.S.W. private enterprises j think nothing
of collecting a 100 per cent, per annum
dividend out of the great Cornstalk silver
town, and the town has just to pay and
look pleasant, or look any other old way
that suits it. It is only one more aspect of
the Sydney congestion policy. A good many
years ago great wealth was discovered on a
spot at the other end of the State from
Sydney. The old city sat up suddenly, and
then sat down again suddenly. The rich
place was too far away. to make a direct
railway to Sydney and direct trade with
Sydney immediately feasible. It might, if
carefully fostered, yield a handsome revenue
to the State at large, but that was another
matter. So a Melbourne co. was thrown
the job of supplying it with a railway, and
another Melbourne co. had the job of furnish-
ing water chucked at it, and the big mines
were mostly managed from Melbourne, and
Melbourne has made a good thing out of the
place ever since.
AT POVERTY POINT.
JOSEPH AND
HIS
BRETHREN
Another sna[?]
from the
audience.
Choosing “extra”
ladies for
"Joseph and His
Brethren,”
Some Chosen
ones .
The Napoleonic glory of Julius Knight was some-
what dimmed the other evening, at Sydney Royal, by
a bit of dusty economy. After one of the battle
scenes, a weary-looking drop was let down, and the
star of “The Royal Divorce” emerged to take his
call through an opening over which a faded “T.Q.”
was still visible. The remnant of the Quinlan grand-
opera season might have been freshened up a bit
before it was hung out again. But nowanights none
of the J.C.W. shows seem to get that last lick of
paint that makes all the difference.
“H.”The-Australian has to go away to do any
good on . the boards. When Lillah Carmichael was
here she supported a fragment of scenery for several
profitless years as a J. C. Williamson show girl.
Then, in desperation, she left for America. To-day
she is the star actress of the Lubin Co., which is
one of the biggest, if not the biggest, picture film
manufacturing concern in the world. At the Crystal
Palace, Sydney, there is being shown at the time of
writing a picture representation of “Within the
Law.” The Australian girl plays lead, and does it
so well that a local manager, with whom I saw the
show, declined doggedly to believe that she was of
local extraction. Probably if the Carmichael girl
came back, with her blushing honors festooned about
her, she would be rushed; but it is a poor sort of
profession that only recognises its stars when they
have either been trained or acclaimed, or both, on
the other side of the earth.
“Joseph and His Brethren” is distinctly in the
nature of an entertainment for good litle boys and
girls, Jacob and his beard and Joseph’s coat and
other matters of Bible interest are almost as appeal-
ing to the infant mind as Dick Whittington and Jack
the Giant Killer. Also there is a camel introduced
into the “Joseph” drama. The kiddies speak of the
momentary camel when they are going home after the
performance. They feel as though they had been
to Sunday-school in a circus. The coat of many
colors that Joseph wears in the play at the Royal
is very unlike the garment that Miss Von Finkel-
stein of yore brought from Palestine. Miss Von
Fink, the leeturess, had lived among the women in
Canaan and thereabouts, and the “properties” she
displayed on the platform were collected at the
places she talked about. Joseph’s gaudy garment
was of silk woven in one piece—-a coat with no
visible seams except in the sleeves. The appalling
smoking jacket that Malcolm Tearle wears looks like
a collection of broad satin ribbons, stitched together
with a sewing-machine. It is full of seams.
“0.K.”: The superlative “cheek” of Gene Greene,
the ragtime man, bedazzled some of the Melbourne
theatrical business folk so completely that they seri-
ously referred to him as a “great artist,” though to
many of the paying public Greene was a wearisome
exponent of music-hall bawling in its most foolish
form. The cool audacity of the ragtimer, his adroit
method of handling an audience, was what impressed
those cynical purveyors of entertainment whose maxim
is that “the public will swallow anything if you know
how to give it to ’em.” Greene was the most self-
confident little battler / ever saw on the stage. The
closing incident of his first season at Melbourne
Tivoli nearly produced an uproar among the people.
He acted as timekeeper and referee at the finals of
an amateur ragtime competition, and his award gave
general dissatisfaction. Yet in the midst of the
hubbub he rose to his “farewell” occasion by drink-
ing two glasses of lager beer to the health of his
friends in front. His manner of enforcing silence
whilst he poured out the beer and swallowed it was
a triumph of “bluff,” but I wouldn’t call it the
work of a great artist. Greene reappeared at Mel-
bourne Tiv. last week for one consecutive day, and
this time he farewelled himself with musical honors.
Instead of bursting up a bottle of beer after making
his little speech, he called upon the audience to
join him in “Auld Lang ,Syne.” So a lot of impres-
sionable citizens sang “Should auld acquaintance be
forgot?” with Gene leading the noise. He did the
same sort of thing in Sydney two nights later, of
course. If Greene returns to Australia, as he threat-
ens, I will expect him to call upon the orchestra to
strike up thb Anthem that the audience may sjng
with heart arid voice, “God Save Audacious Greene,”
etc.
London papers lately to hand alleged that Ellen
Terry was under contract to start a Shakspearean
lecture tour of Australia and Maoriland in April,
and that Joe Blascheck, “the entertainer,” was leav-
ing for Melbourne in February to make necessary
arrangements. But the cable tlnisfar has said nothing
about Ellen’s movements in this direction. She is.
an elderly Miss -Terry nowadays—6s, perhaps—and
her memory is so treacherous that she could hardly
get through a lecture-ci/m-recitations without fre-
quent reference to her notes.
“Harrison O.”:-However little justification he has
on the score of art or necessity, it cannot be said
that Louis Parker is trifling with the Biblical history
in representing Mrs. Potiphar, in “Joseph and His
Brethren,” as a lurid adventuress, for history tells
us next to nothing of the lady. In the Bible she
has not even a name, neither has she in the Koran.
Charles Wells has pictured her as another Cleopatra.
A Persian poet, one .Mint, has represented her as a
beautiful and tender girl, Zulaikha (Parker calls his
heroine Zuleika), who, before being wedded to Poti-
phar, is haunted by a vision of a youth. Joseph,
whom she meets after her marriage, is the realisa-
tion of her dream, and the girl’s subsequent love-
making is, therefore, held by the poet to be the
inevitable outcome of a magnetic attraction. Joseph
comes very near to responding to Zulaikha’s advances,
and, in the end, Potiphar having died, actually
marries her. The present writer’s theory in regard
to Mrs. Potiphar, formed after an examination of
Joseph’s attitude, is that she was an unbeauteous
female of 58 or thereabouts.
Stanley Houghton, the author of “Hindle Wakes,”
died last month aged 32. He was a Manchester stock-
broker when he wasn’t writing plays.
Maoriland Pictures Supplies, Ltd., is to open an
Australian despatch office in Sydney. .Geoffrey Nye,
who. Knows as much about the business as is neces-
sary if everybody is playing fair, wilt manage the
concern. If everybody is not playing, fair, brother
Nye \Vill turn to and go all he knows.
“B. J.”: Again the immemorial vanity of the
actor person. In the recently issued “Gaiety and
George Grossmith,” the Fog’s best-known player of
silly-ass parts, confidently asserts: “An actor of aver-
age ability, even the plainest of us, could turn a
girl from the most fascinating Guardsman in half
an hour.”
“Gaff” : “The Royal Divorce” has gained some noto-
riety in England, not through any intrinsic merit of the
play, which is rather triney, but because of its long
provincial career and the vast number of good mum-
mers who have played Napoleon. These include
Murray Carson, J. H. Clyndes, George Cockburn,
Frank Lister, Mat Brodie, Fred Victor, Fred Moyes
—-all excellent actors. Lister, who was specially
engaged for the Lyceum production recently, with
Ethel Warwick as Josephine, indulges in a Napoleonic
sketch in the halls during his vacation. The Ameri-
can W. W. Kelly, who is responsible for the piece
and has made a mint of money out of it, controls
several theatres, including the Shakspeare at Liver-
pool. Wishing to strengthen the cast when lie was
going to the Kennington Theatre, London, he wired
Carson, the original Nap., asking him “lowest terms
for special week.” Carson replied £BO. Kelly
wired back: “Make it shillings, and consider it
settled.”
One of the Cockney critics makes some candid
remarks on the acting of Gertie Millar, a much-
adored and imitated ornament of the frivolous-comedy
stage. “Miss Millar frisks her way through the
piece in her usual gay and sprightly fashion, though
by this time the clockwork precision of all she does
makes it seem a little mechanical.”
Hayden Coffin, the old-established light-opera tenor,
is exploiting some recipes prepared by his father, Dr.
Coffin, of yore. The old man was a famous dental
specialist in his time, and his dentifrice recipe has
been put on the market by his son under the good
advertising name of Hayden Coffin Tooth Powder.
G. R. Sims has exploited his name and photo on
a hair-restorer label for many years, and even Hiram
Maxim has a patent cure for asthma, but, thusfar, the
popular-identity device in connection with “specifics”
has not been nearly worked to death. Why not an
Andrew Fisher Throat Lozenge, or a Julius Knight
Liver Pill?
“J.F.H.” (from London) : The twice-nightly sys-
tem, which for some years has been successfully
worked in a number of variety halls, has been
started in some of the suburban play-houses. Actors
and actresses are up in arms against it; but the
managers allege that they have no alternative. It
is a case of either fighting the variety houses with
their own weapons or chucking up the sponge and
going out of the business. Says one of them: “The
old policy of one piece a night is played out. In
London and the big provincial cities there are hosts
of people who must be up at six in the morning if
they are to get to their work in good time. They
cannot go to the play that finishes up at 11 p.m.
From six to nine in the twice-nightly houses is the
one thing that suits them.” Which is all true, no
doubt; but the trouble is that the manager expects
the actor to feed the two lots of customers for the
price he previously charged for feeding one. Sup-
pose, for a change, that the manager lets Bill and
his girl come in for the price he previously charged
for Bill alone!
The old opera of “Joseph” (and His Brethren) is
to be produced at Covent Garden this coming season.
It was first sung in Paris- more than 100 years ago,
and was the last of 24 operas composed by Mehul.
The libretto follows the Bible story, but omits the
Potiphar’s wife incident which is the centre piece of
the melodrama now being played at Melb. Royal.
In fact, there are no women characters in the cast.
The first scene of the opera is an ante-room of Joseph’s
house in Egypt. He sings, in tenor tones, of his
yearnings to see his native Canaan once again.
Then his brothers arrive on their corn-buying errand,
and Simeon, the chief baritone, warbles his remorse
for having put Joseph down the pit. Jacob is basso,
and Benjamin, his last-born, is impersonated by a
mezzo-soprano lady, as a rule.
Ethel Irving, who has been dead out of luck since
she returned to England from Australia, is now play-
ing the part of the literary man’s lady-help in a
revival of “The Tyranny of Tears.”
(Continued on page 36.)
Annette Kellerman and “40 mermaids” have been
posing for the fliclcerscope in the Bermudas. The
film co. is making the shapely Australian a big fea-
ture of a long picture in which Leah Baird, a notea
picture actress, seen in the recent screening of “Ivan-
hoe,” will be lead.
The Holman (N.S.W.) Government puts
up a sort of record as a Ministry which
brings along its financial statement nearly
nine months late. The election came about
the middle of the financial year. One kind
of Ministry would have hurried its Budget
to the front, so that its finance would recom-
mend it to the electors. This kind of
Government seemingly lay back les(- its fin-
ance should shock the electors to death.
Quite a lot of things might have happened
in the suburbs of Sydney if the increased
tram fares had been announced four months
earlier.
At time of writing, another imported
dredge is being earnestly searched for in the
Bight. The mislaid vessel is suspected of
sinking and drowning, and, if the face of the
sea is found to have no dfedge sliding on it,
the case will be held to be proved. The <
clumsy craft waddled all the way from Rot-
terdam to Fremantle without meeting hope-
less trouble; but the big seas of the Bight
seem to have caught the stranger on the roll!
and scored a fall. Sometimes the imported!
dredge gets through to its benighted destina-
tion ; but it never seems to get through with-
out some bad experiences. Sometimes the
scared crew leaves at an intermediate port"
but a sailor can always be found to face the
risk another sailor has fled from, so the risky
and humiliating business of dredge-importa-
tion goes on. Nothing will stop it but a
prohibitive duty, and when Andrew Fisher
becomes Prime Minister aeain, he ought to
see that the barrier goes up.
INGRATITUDE.
The end of the Sydney meat strike.
When Randolph Bedford wrote his “Ex-
plorations in Civilisations” he drew the
scheme and outline of a great character —the*
commercial Blighter of London. The Blighter-
has a small dingy one-roomed office up many
stairs, is his own clerk, has few visible
means of support, talks in millions, borrows;
small sums, hustles after small commissions,
and wears a fearsome air of pomp and dig-
nity. If his attitude was any criterion it
was the real Blighter of London who was
remanded for sentence at Sydney Quarter
Sessions last Monday. The crude swindle
charged against him was that he rented an
empty office, advertised that he would supply
10yds. of silk for 2s. 6d.. received the 2s. 6d.,
and failed to send any silk. Apparently he
didn’t possess any silk. He declared in the
early stages of the case that his co.—the
Ceylon Silk Co. —was the largest thing of
its kind on earth with branches at —here he
reeled off the names of many of the capitals
of Europe. This gigantic concern had pre-
mises in Australia —address apparently dis-
remembered. It had a manager who was
the Blighter’s employer, but his location was
disremembered also. The Blighter used to
meet him in the street, but couldn’t quite
recall which street. Anyhow, the manager
had left for Melbourne and had apparently-
taken the street and the warehouses with
him. No cablegrams of explanation came-
from any palatial silk premises in London,
Paris, Berlin. St. Petersburg, Vienna, New
York, Gosford. Timbuctoo or elsewhere. It;
looked like a huge common vulgar commer-
cial jest—certainly it was huge enough see-
ing that the police were in time to stop de-
livery of more than 18.000 letters. Still the-
Blighter seemed to feel very keenly the de-
gradation of being tried by a mere colonial
tribunal. He said his father was a person
of size in England and worth £500,000. His
pedigree went back 600' years. He came of
warlike ancestry, and in keeping with the
family traditions he had gone and raged in
the forefront of the battle in South Africa.
After he had slain the Boers he went into
business. Hundreds of thousands of pounds
had passed through his hands, including one
lump sum of £70,000, and his hands, like
those of Colonel Scadder, remained un-
stained. He had filled important positions
in Australia, and had refused a £lOOO a year
job in Melbourne. But the rich father ap-
parently didn’t wire a single word of identi-
fication, and the silence of the tremendous
company continued to the last, and the Brit-
ish War Office rushed to the rescue not
worth a cent. So the Blighter went on his
shocked path to retirement.

Step in, fair ladies, joyously,
Soon will the bright tent overflow,
Ours is a noble company.

Be merry till the curtain falls.
An’ would ye have young Romeo
Ascend the moonlit balcony ;
Or Harry march to flout the foe;
Or Cleopatra’s canopy ;
Farce or Romance or Tragedy,
Gay streets, green fields, or castle walls?
Such choice delights we hold in fee —■
Be merry till the curtain falls.
An’ scorn ye not our joy and woe,
Or mimic combats bold and free,
This world is but a painted show,
A stage of shifting scenery ;
Brief rfre Life’s brightest acts, perdie,
And long the dark, drear intervals—
I pray you of your courtesy,
Be merry till the curtain falls.

Poor' strolling players all are We,
An’ though, mayhap, the drama palls,
Right good is our philosophy—
Be merry till the curtain falls.

"Rally! Do you know sometimes I'm posi-

Premier Holman, in the N.S.W. Assembly
(3/3/’l4) on the month-old meat strike in
Sydney
This is a strike of which there is no legal evidence
in existence to this moment.
Merely a rumor, so to speak.
From “10-2-4.”
Henry Lucy, the S. M. Herald’s London corre-
spondent, lately weighed in with the following:—-
“When Pitt, Earl of Chatham, was approaching his
last illness, he was tendered the use of North End,
Hampstead. . . .During his residence at North End
the old warrior statesman was afflicted by profound
melancholia. Day after day he sat in solitude in a
little room on the top storey of North End with his
head resting on his hands, spread open on the table.
He could not endure the presence of any person, not
even that of his own wife He would not permit
a servant to enter the room with his meals. He had
an opening made in the wall, closed by a sliding
door. When the frugal food was brought up Chat-
ham withdrew the slide, took it in, when he nad
finished returned the plate, shut the slide and went
back to his forlorn position at the table. At the
close of long years, spent in the service of the
State. .. . nothine was ever seen or heard of so
pathetic as this lonely man in the small attic room.’’
There is no mention of this room, or of
the business of the sliding panel, or of
a lunatic passion for solitude on the part
of Pitt (who was not Earl of Chatham, by the
way, when he was at North End) either in Walpole’s
“Letters,” or in the same writer’s “George III,” or in
Chatham's correspondence, or in the “Grenville Papers”
or in Rosebery, or in Von Ruville’s big “Life Of
Chatham,” which was published last year. It is highly
significant that Walpole does not refer to the story
of the lonely meals and the honorable head bowed low
in despair. He was one of greatest gossips of all
time —in fact, a sort of super-Lucy—and this is a
sensational item that he would not have missed for
worlds.
But there is more definite evidence as to the idiocy
of the yarn. Pitt went to North End in
July, 1766. There is no doubt he was ill at the time
—it is believed that fie had gout in an aggravated
form. History records, however, that he was at
North End for less than three months altogether.
He first arrived at the beginning of July, and he left
for good towards the end of the following September.
During his stay there he had little leisure available
for the purposes of resting his head on tables and so
forth. As a matter of fact he was hard at work
manoeuvring to oust the Rockingham Ministry. It is
on record that he drove to London on July 13 and
again on Jill" 15, and saw prospective colleagues.
At various dates in August they came to Hampstead
to see him. Many of his letters are written from
North End—a notable one for example, bears the
date July 22. During the whole of August and the
early part of September, he drove about the Heath
with Mrs. Pitt on fine afternoons. Towards the end
of September, his tireless work at North End bore
fruit. The Rockingham Ministry fell. The alleged
melancholic, the broken ruin who shunned mankind
like a maniac, was at once sent for by the King (he
had by this time left North End and gone to Bath)
and on September 30 he “kissed hands” as Prime
Minister. He was made Earl of Chatham, shortly
afterwards, and didn’t die till some years later.
A possible basis of Lucy’s story is the fact that
Pitt’s appetite was variable. Like Napoleon, he
always had relays of chickens roasting for him, so
that one might be ready whenever he wanted to eat.
And, also, like Napoleon, he ate in whatever room
he chanced to be working. The odds are incalculably
long against the sliding panel arrangement, having
been introduced by Pitt to the house of a compara-
tive stranger, which house he was occupying as a
guest and for a brief period at that. It is infinitely
more likelv, if it exists, to be of Early or Mid-
Victorian origin—in brief, part of the apparatus by
which food is brought from the kitchen to the upper
storeys in a dinner lift. As an example of the garb-
ling of history for the purposes of bogus sentiment, I
haven’t seen anything to beat this effort of Lucy’s
for some considerable time.

—Melbourne AGE.
Northcote is the latest Melbourne suburb
that hankers after the honor of being dubbed
a city. It has miles of unmade streets, so
torn up by brick drays that in summer the
place is a Sahara, in winter a bog. Some
parts of it are lit with kerosene. Recently,
however, it was decided to introduce electric
light. The usual sub-committee was ap-
pointed, the cable was imported, and then
it was found to be half a mile too short. The
council’s officers had based their calculations
on an antiquated map discovered in the
mayor’s cupboard or the town clerk’s chest
of drawers, or it may have been the rate
collector’s pants. After that, things went on
quite smoothly except for the trifling dis-
covery that the scheme would cost £13,000
instead of £7OOO. The only thing Northcote
owns more of than dirt and muddle is debt;
and there is a strong suspicion that it wants
to get still more of it, and longs to be called
a city so that it can pawn the name.

Cudmore, a young amateur politician, had
stated before a Federal Commission that a
lady scrutineer was exceeding her duties in
a polling-booth, and he asked the presiding-
oflicer to remove her. Dr. Maloney pressed
witness for the name, which proved to be
Miss Denny.
W. J. Denny (M.H.A. and ex-Atttorney-General), in
open letter to Cudmore: “Sir, you are a contemptible
cad, and a liar to refer to my sister as you did. I

invite you (and if you had the spirit of a louse,
which you have not, you would accept) to make the
same statement in public, so that the law courts can
be invoked.”
Cudmore, to the Adelaide dailies: “Mr. Denny has
done well in writing from a distance, in lieu ol
accepting the consequences of using such expressions
to my face. I would not willingly descend to Mr.
Denny’s level, and, therefore, do not propose to
reply to him.” .
Denny to the same: “He made a huge mistake it
he thinks I am not prepared to take the physical
as well as the legal consequences of my letter. He
has only to intimate to one of my friends when he
desires me to “use the expressions to his (cer-
tainly not a very pleasant aspect!. suitable time
and place can be easily arranged.”
After which dignified opening the parties
descended, regrettably, to mere personalities.
THE NIGGER AND THE CHOW.
[FOR THE BULLEIN.]
Major Davies is an Australian whose name has
attained prestige through his career in South Africa.
He is well-informed respecting Australian opinion,
and he has an instinctive knowledge of Australian
prejudices, yet he has the courage to affirm that in-
dentured colored labor would be the best, if not
the only, solvent of the difficulties which confront us
in settling the Northern Territory with white people.
He looks upon the work of the colored man as an
essential preliminary to the establishment of a pros-
perous white community. The example on which
Major Davies relies to prove the value of indentured
labor is the employment of Chinese coolies in the
mines of South Africa. .. .Major Davies asserts that
the coolie labor saved South Africa from a serious
financial crisis.— Melb. Argus.
Oh, hearken to the story of the Major from afar,
Who is famous in the country where indentured
coolies are;
Where the Piet-and-Ike alliance handles labor troubles
well,
For it trains its 18-pounders on the sinners who
rebel;
And hear the Argus howling with the sweat upon its
brow:
“If we cannot have the nigger, then let us have
the Chow.”
The Argus in its anguish sighs for Jew combined
with Boer
To make this land a Paradise for millionaires grown
poor;
When in the virgin North shall rise the new Aus-
tralian State,
With sjambok and with half-caste sown, to prove
that we are great,
No labor feuds shall rage to vex us then as they do
now,
For if we lack the nigger we can always find the
Chow.
The refuse raked from every soil, dredged up on
every coast,
The black, the brown, the brindled—-this shall be
our patriot boast;
We shall not throw the dice with Chance, as men
have done of yore,
Unless the mean and filthy slave has won the game
before;
We found this land unpeopled, and the Lord knows
why or how;
So stock it with the nigger, and, failing him, the
Chow.

Charles Bailey, the spiritualistic medium,
has been once again denounced as a com-
paratively crude impostor, but the latest
event is no more likely to shake the faith
of his devoted barrackers than any of his
previous unpleasant experiences. Last week,
at Leigh House, Sydney, 40 or 50 people paid
ss. a head for the pleasure of seeing Bailey
raise a few spirits of the dead under the
usual seance conditions. In a darkened
room, what time the audience was drowning
the rustle of the medium fakements by sing-
ing hymns at his request, Bailey produced a
series of vague apparitions. The last spirit
on the programme got poor Bailey into .
trouble. The manager of the show — i.e.,
Mr. li. Towns, who had engaged the artist.
—made a grab at the ghostly form and
caught hold of “a flimsy material,” where-
upon he called for a light on the proceed-.]
ings. By the transient gleam of a stricken !
match it appeared that Towns was pulling
at one end of the veiling, whilst Bailey whs
hanging on to the other with one
hand. His other hand was engaged in
pulling on his elastic-side boots, which , spoke
well for his presence of mind. He had taken
his boots off, of course, in order that the
apparitions might move with noiseless tread.
By the time the gas was lighted the dis-
comfited medium had recovered full posses-
sion of his gauzy outfit and was seen to be
stuffing it under his coat preparatory to
flight. Eventually he fled liatless from the
haunted chamber and found sanctuary in the
house of a medical man. This was perhaps
the first time that Bailey had been caught
in the very act of fooling his easy dupes,
though the exposure of his fraudulene.y as a
producer of material “apports” from Asia
is an old story. A year or two subsequent
to the Lone Hand’s ventilation of the
Bailey business the man was proved to have
nurchased at a local shop a bird which he
introduced to a “circle” in France (or
Italy) as a newly-arrived apport from
Egypt. The Lone Hand article had pre-
viously dealt with his career of fraud up to
date. It appeared in August. 1908, and was
the joint narrative of D. K. Inglis, who
accepted the “medium” as a genuine miracle-
worker. and of Edmund Fisher, who de-
nounced him ;as a common trickster, and a
clumsy trickster at that. An extract from
THE GUSHING CHILD OF NATURE.
MRS. TARBRUSH (to person in very expensive furs): “My word! Plenty possum where
you come from, missus! ”
Edmund Fisher’s reminiscences of Bailey’s
crude attempt to raise spirits :
He was supposed to be converted into the ghost
of a little girl—the deceased daughter of a lady
present. Shining vaguely amidst darkness the mate-
rialised damsel looked very like a piece of phosphor-
ised muslin. This fraud was so childish that the
details have passed from my memory, but a subse-
quent manifestation was unforgettable. It was the
very spirit of unconscious humor. Bailey announced
that Mr. Somebody’s father was before us, and there,
on the floor near the cabinet, gleamed a poor little
patch of gauzy light.... The primitive vision sufficed
to impress the particular person for whom it was
intended. We were a double semi-circle at this
amusing seance —a front row and a back row. One
of the men in the back row arose from his chair, and
spoke solemnly over my head: “Good evening, father,
we are glad to have you with us,” etc., etc.
The world is 10 years older than when
Bailey gave the name of somebody’s father
to a 'poor little patch of gauzy light. His
present spectres are full-sized figures, seem-
ingly. Nevertheless, he didn’t know enough
about his business to be able to get through
a seance without having a manifestation
torn from his shoulders.
The recent disaster which befell Bailey,
the “medium,” at Leigh House, Sydney, is a
reminder that the ghost-raising science
doesn’t progress. Its spectre is the same
old rag. It is getting on for 20 years since
Justice Windeyer, of N.S.W., solemnly at-
tested his faith in the authenticity of the
spooks raised by Sydney’s prize medium of
tile day—and then some less credulous ob-
servers waded into the investigation and
found that the disembodied one was a night-
dress suspended on the end of a clotlies-prop,
or something equally simple. A logical re-
sult might have been the retirement of his
Honor from the bench and a re-trial of a
number of prisoners who had had amazing
sentences passed on them in his court, for
such a credulous spookist niust have been
sadly wanting in the judicial faculty; but
nothing was done.
“Pile Light” speaks :
The' British naval authorities have been surveying
Sydney Harbor, and have found that the water
south of Bradley’s Head has shoaled to four and
five fathoms, instead of the eight and nine charted.
Although this discovery was made months ago, red-
tape demanded that the information be first communi-
cated through the Admiral of the station to the Admi-
ralty in London, and the news now filters out through
the official “notices” printed in that far off and
remote city. Last month a big tramp going down
the east channel struck bottom in nine fathoms of
water as alleged on the chart. Of course, it wouldn’t
have happened if, when shoaling had been discovered
th'erbabouts, the discoverer had clamored like an
elephant. Still, that wouldn’t have been etiquette.
Ten years or so ago, when the Sydney Harbor Trust
erected the two green light beacons on Goat Island, they
were notified by a clerical error as white. The navi-
gating officer on board the Euryalus spotted the mis-
take, and informed the Commander. He reported to
the Admiral, who sent on to London, and months
after a formal notice came out in the Admiralty
notices that the Goat Island beacons, advertised as
white, were apparently green. A ’phone message to
the harbor-master would have brought about a cor-
rection at once, but there’s nothing picturesque about
a telephone. A mere wharf-lumper can use it if he’s
got a day off.
FAR TOO MUCH SELF-RESPECT.
M ISTRESS: "Nora, I wish to caution you against repeating anything you may happen to
hear my husband or myself say should we be having a slight aifference of opinion .”
NORA (horrified): "The Saints forbid, mum."
“Parisine” on the latest spoof in Paris: —
Editor Bifault, of the Eclair, invented a great
defunct personage, named him Hegisippe Simon, and
referred to him vaguely as a precursor of modern
progress. Birault sent a circular round to the
Radical members of the Senate and the Deputies,
asking to be allowed to inscribe their names as
honorary members of a committee to celebrate the
centenary of Hegisippe, and he added that it was
proposed to put up a statue in Hegisippe’s native
town. Speeches at the function of unveiling were
invited from recipients of the circular, which was
headed by a quotation from Heg.: “Darkness van-
ishes when the sun rises.” Fifteen senators and
nine deputies replied that they would be glad to
co-operate, and some of them referred in eulogistic
terms to the great services of the deceased to
humanity. The dupes included Sarrien, a former
Premier, and Bennard, who had also been a Minister.
The roar that followed the disclosure of the elaborate
fake nearly broke up the winter.
* * * *
“Peter Culex”: The recent reporting of
cholera from Rabaul is another reminder of
Australia’s nearness to the diseases of Asia
in these days of rapid sea transit. Rabaul is
in New Britain, about six days steam from
Brisbane, and one day from Friedrickwil-
helmshafen, the capital of German Papua.
If cholera were to get loose anywhere in
Papua, the habits and customs of the gentle
Papuan would enable it to spread with even
greater rapidity than dysentery, and it would
not be long in getting to Queensland via
Torres Straits. There is also any amount of
cholera in Java, and cholera
is to say, persons who can infect others with
cholera, although themselves apparently
healthy, are common enough in infected
places. A little of the infective material in
one of the insanitary water supplies which
are the rule in coastal Queensland towns,
would produce results of a; particularly start-
ling kind. Small-pox has also been reported
from German Papua, but it is an open secret
that it has existed amongst natives for a long
time past. In Dutch Papua, small-pox has
played Ancient Henry in recent years, and
at the Aru Islands, some two days- steam
from Thursday Island, 15,000 deaths amongst
natives were reported from it a few years
ago. What makes small-pox so dangerous a
neighbor, is that the period between receiving
the infection and developing the first signs
of the disease averages 12 days. This gives
ample time for a steamer to land an infected
person from the Arus in Brisbane, or even
in Sydney, before anything could occur to
show that he was loaded. No system of
quarantine at the seaboard can detect cases
of this kind, for there is absolutely nothing
to go on until the fever begins. This, too, is
not the mild variety such as Sydney _ has
lately had experience of, but the real Asiatic
brand, with a mortality of one in three.
Java, Timor and the Philippines also contain
any amount of small-pox infection, and are
within easy striking distance of Australian
ports.
In the advt. col. of the S. M. Herald “a
yg, gent, who req. priv. bd., res.,” advertises

a recommendation for his last boarding-house.
And not much of an inducement for a new
landlady to take him in and fill up his empti-
ness.

Mexico, with all its revolutions and up-
heavals, is a big and reckless wild cat, and
a nasty flying cactus of a proposition to
handle. It buried the reputations of Napo-
leon 111., and Bazaine, and Forey and
Maximilian of Austria, and it might have
done the same with General Prim, great
fighter as he was, only that astute Spaniard
left early. So Britain asks the United
States Government to tell the rebel General
Villa that his conduct in murdering a Brit-
ish subject has created a bad impression,
and asks for the return of the body. But
all is not lost. The . other day a Portuguese'
officer in Africa put. a. British Baptist mis-
sionary under a sort of arrest on a charge of
urging the natives’ to insurrection —at. least
he seems to have requested the Baptist to
regard himself as a prisoner on parole, and!
suspended, and bound over to abstain from a
superfluity of loose eloquence, until some
superior authority had time to consider his
case. Now Portugal isn’t a wild cat —in
fact, it is more like a mouse. It has no
Monroe doctrine to fall back upon. Also it
has valuable and defenceless colonies which
might be worth annexing. So Portugal
can’t take liberties as Mexico does, and the
way it was made to sit up over the wrongs
of Bowskill, the Baptist, was very sudden
indeed. The War of .Jenkins’ Ear wasn’t
in the same category for velocity.

Premier Scaddan, of Westralia, impresses
everybody with his personal evidences of
Jewish extraction. He has the Hebrew com-
plexion and cast of countenance, a slightly
Chosen manner of speech, and a suggestion
of Jewishness in his symptoms of approach-
ing baldness. Looking at Scaddan one nat-
urally begins to speculate about the evolution
of his family name. Perhaps he is descended
from Jacob on the maternal side only.
H. D. Cell, the new chairman of S.A. State

the Sunday School Union, the Justices’ Asso-

has been a magistrate, and the liquidator of
a bank. He will be 70 next year—which is
another thing. By-and-bye he will be a great
loss to the community, which will be the last
thing. But that, everybody hopes, is a long
way off yet.

Lawyer A. C. Destree, whose legal mind
is tempered with musical talent, has returned
to Melbourne to practice, after nine years of
living abrawd. -His hair has gone grey in
the course of his long absence, but the
bachelor heart of Destree remains young as
ever. He is probably the only solicitor on
earth who plays both the piano and the big
bassoon. All of his nine years away were
not devoted to roamings. For some time he
practiced in Johannesburg, in partnership
with one Schikkerling, a genial Boer who
fired many a bullet in defence of his country
when the Absent Minded Beggars were
around. Destree speaks affectionately of
Schikkerling as a fine corrective to anti-
Boerism. What the returned Australian
lawyer doesn’t know about the war in
S’Africa and local politics up to date is
hardly worth knowing.
JUDGE. REAL , OF QUEENSLAND.
What H. G. Wells wrote as burlesque is
the solemn manner of Australian snobbery.
In the opening chapters of “Tono-Bungay’
there is an assemblage of retired house-
keepers, butlers, and varied flunkeys. The
lydy with the hair painted on her forehead
remarks that “what is most wanted in a
colonial Governor is Tact. Tact.” The wor-
shipping Melb. ’Erald went the other day to
see the new Governor’s wife, and fell on its
stomach to burble about “her ladyship s ex-
quisite Tact.” The ’Erald should have been
a butler. It would have filled the bill well
if it had only known how to buttle.
“F.” writes: —
William McLinen having failed in his assault
on the N. S. Wales Assembly, the draper section ot
Sydney is searching round for a substitute. (The
idea in millinery circles was that McL. was
to oust Wade from the leadership ot the
Liberal party provided he —McL. —got elected.) H. Y.
Braddon is ' the reigning favorite. He is a son ot
Tasmania’s old Premier Braddon; a ready speaker;
and popular. Wade’s recent pronouncement that he
will give the next three years •to the practice ot
his profession is generally regarded as equivalent
to the skying of the political wipe on his part.
Cohen, Levy, Fitzpatrick and the rest are, ot
course, utterly impossible as leaders and improba-
hie, to put it courteously, in any other capacity.
The moralisings of “Bloggs” :
The case of Cora Minnett, or Bridget Jones, or
Alicia O’Flaherty, or whatever her right name may
be, who, at the' time of writing, is being sued in
London by an infuriated bank ior. £2500 allegedly
presented to her by one of its cashiers, demonstrates,
-yet again, that it takes a woman to make solid busi-
ness men look really idiotic. Beauty is not an
essential. Madame Humbert, who charmed millions
out of the parsimonious commercial section of Paris
by the simple device of stating that she had untold
wealth in a locked safe, was fat, old and plain.
Nerve and character and that elusive thing which we
call charm are the essentials. With these qualities
goes, as a matter of course, tireless energy. The
Minnett lady seems to possess all the requisites of
the successful “adventurer in life,’’ as a London
Daily Mail writer termed England’s new Chief
Justice the other day. There are few avenues of
toil that she has neglected to exploit. Novel-writing,
the stage, journalism, company-promoting, clair-
voyancy—these she has admitted to in the witness-
box, according to the cable. Being the sort of
woman she is, it is a thousand to one that during
her various stays in Australia, she was, under one
name or another, a leader of various Wimmen’s
Liberal Leagues; a prominent Peace and No-License
advocate; an opponent of Surf Bathing; and an
eloquent pamphleteer on such subjects as the wrongs
of Poon Gooey and his family ; and the hopelessness
of the Northern Territory as a place for white set-
tlers. The Cora Minnetts of this world cannot settle
down and lead the placid vegetable existence. The
Sabbath peace of the suburban home is no good to
them. They must be up and doing all the time.
The unfortunate thing is that shortly after they get
up and doing, their business and other associates
are liable to start treading the thorny path which
leads to the Insolvency Court, or worse. A horrible
peril is the magnetic female, with schemes for the
swift acquisition of money.
Concerning a deceased snake-expert: —
With his mop- of light, wandering, wayward hair
and his pale, far-away, grey eyes, my unfortunate
friend, “Professor” Fox, late of Botany, looked more
like a refugee spring-poet than an uncanny associate
of glistening, beady-eved serpents. Nevertheless, he
was the genuine article. Many a time have I sat in
the cool dimness of his snake-house while he held
forth to an admiring but imaginary audience on his
invaluable services to the world of science and even
art, and especially to the populace of this sunny land
of Australia. At such times I would remain on an
upturned flower-pot, my fevered brow resting in my
hands, watching snakes —real snakes—noiselessly
slithering and sliding around, about and over my
feet and ankles. And now, since the Professor” has
had a fatal argument with a deadly krait in India,
my mind’s eye sees him wandering through the
Elysian fields, with the old, speculative, faraway look
in his gentle eyes. But I’m afraid he’ll be dreadfully
disappointed when he stops before a tree on some
celestial squatter’s acre, and, from a notice tacked
on high, reads that the serpent has been declared
a thistle under an ancient Act of the time of Adam
I. Also, it won’t cheer him any when, later, he
learns that even the original reptile was preserved
and bottled by Mrs. Eve, and now reposes in the
Hades Museum and Hall of Arts, or whatever they
call the thing there.
Frank Robb, known for advertising pur-
poses as F. Maldon Robb, is a Victorian
lawyer who was once a Tasmanian parson.
He climbed into the public eye by
opposing Anstey, M.H.R., for
Bourke (Vic.), at the last Federal
elections. The 1911 referendum
poll appeared to, foreshadow a
minority for Anstey in 1913; but
when that year’s results were
posted, Robb was seen to be lead-
ing easily at the wrong end. In a
large degree, this was due to An-
stey’s personal popularity. Anstey,
even though all that is left in the
cupboard be a small plate of cold
potatoes, will cheerfully hand-out
on demand and go spudless to his
bunk. A reputation of this sort is
a great help in vote-getting, par-
ticularly when one’s opponent is an
ex-parson. Lately, “representa-
tions have been made” to the ex-
reverend Robb, by a section of Lib-
eralism. to “induce him to consent”
to stand for the Bendigo seat at the
next Federal disturbance. Also, he
is being “strongly pressed” to con-
test Bourke once more. Shall he be
a little David, going forth against
Goliath Arthur; or. remembering his early
Christian training, shall he stay to turn the
other cheek in Bourke? Neither proceeding
seems to offer him the chance of any political
prestige worth mentioning.
When the last Federal election was on it
was discovered that Joe Cook was enrolled
as a journalist —and the journalists were
pretty sore about it. If the same law applies
to Federal elections as to municipal ones
Joe’s seat might be challenged. Lawyer and
alderman Windeyer, of Hunter’s Hill
(N.S.W.), recently challenged the election
of another alderman on the grounds of mis-
representation. The party, a wight named
Moore, is a grower of roses, but on his
nomination paper he described himself as a
civil engineer. The affidavit of Windeyer set
forth that Moore had been a clerk to Ivan
Henry, then a hotel broker on his own. and
bad finally blossomed into a professional
rose-grower. Also, that electorally lie ran in
many shapes. On the State roll he was down
as an “electoral returning officer,” on _ the
supplemental Federal roll as a “journalist,”
and on the municipal roll as “gentleman.”
The case is now to be fought out.
THE WAY WE SAY IT.

THE TYPICAL Y OUTH: “ Cripes, tha's 'at!!”
J. G. Beuther, drowned after a thunder-
storm in crossing a South Australian creek —
dry the day before, and a mere trickle the
day after —was best known in the Far North
of that State and the Far West of Queens-
land. He had the Lutheran mission station
at Kilalnaninna for nearly 20 years, and
raised nine sons, who are mostly missionaries,
too. His fine collection of native weapons
was bought by Adelaide Museum; he kept
the University’s botanical school supplied
with seeds otherwise unknown : and his know-
ledge of tribal languages was so great that
he has left a dictionary of them in manu-
script.
“Den,” of the Backblocks Ballads, lately
applied to the Victorian Lands Department
for what-is known as a “garden license” —a
piece of scrip that confers the right to dig
poetry out of three acres of Victorian soil.
It sent him the usual schedule of queries,
and called on him to make solemn declara-
tion as to whether lie already owned any
land in fee simple or otherwise, or whether
his wife held any. The first-named question
he answered in the negative; the second
likewise. But to avoid any possibility of
ambiguity (or it may be bigamy), he added:
“I also beg to inform you that I do not own
a wife, either in fee simple or otherwise.”
At Yampi Sound, in the Nor’-West of
Westralia, a magnificent deposit of very
accessible iron ore exists. Instead of the
Government keeping it for the future, the
Japs are allowed to cart it by the shipload to
their own country, apparently on paying a
small royalty to a Queensland syndicate
which some time ago was understood to have
secured a lease of the area. Australia is an
obliging country. It not only provides a
prospective enemy with plans of its fortifi-
cations, but supplies him with the material
to build the ships to attack those fortifica-
tions, if he should feel inclined to adopt that
at present quite unnecessary course.
MORE COMPETITION.
The Federal Government was considering to-day
whether it should supply Sydney with a daily trawl
of fish. Thus the possibilities of the next week or
two include Mr. Holman as a retail butcher and
the Prime Minister (Mr. Cook) as a fishmonger.

If there is a Cassandra among the
workers of South Africa, she has good
reason to fear the gifts of the British Labor
party—the same being according to a last
week’s cable, Tom Mann and Ben Tillett.
A sorrier pair of frauds, regarded as organ-
isers, never imposed on a credulous body of
toilers. They belong to the back ages of
industrial strife. For years they have lived
comfortably on one solitary achievement,
which is to say the work done by them in
the London Dockers’ strike. Neither has
achieved anything of value since, unless
vague, futile blitherings about the . advisa-
bility of heaving off the chains be
counted to them for righteousness. When
the wretched Thomas is asked to sug-
gest a workable Wages Board scheme

When the Citizens’ was fighting its way up, and
when it was still thought incredible that there could
be any respectable sort of insurance that wasn’t
purely mutual, the office didn’t make conspicuous the
fact that for its services it was taking one-fifth of
the profits. Of late years, however, it has set out
the figures plainly. In order to secure uniformity
the shareholders’ bonus has been included among
claims in the foregoing; but in the following table
the amount has been added to the expenses:—

In a purely mutual office the policy-holders get all
the profits. But it by no means follows that there
will be any profits for them to get. The mutual
system is, in other words, not a guarantee of good
management. On the other hand, the very reason-
able. claim of this other sort of office is that, having
an interest in the profits, it will take all sorts of
care that profits are made. And the people who
control the concern, in making profits for them-
selves, must make at least four times more for the
policy-holders.
It may not be this system that has done it; it
may be the able men who have had the co.’s affairs
in hand. But whichever it is, here are the results—
never more strikingly shown, perhaps, than by the
trustees for the policy-holders in the Widows’ Fund,
which was absorbed between four and five years ago.
The Widows’ Fund was a highly respectable old
mutual office; yet the trustees —all of them directors
or otherwise concerned in the former management—
certify that “the rate of bonus now paid for the
third year in succession represents on the average an
increase of 100 p.c. over the rate of bonus dis-
tributed by the Australian Widows’ Fund prior to
the union.” They add that this “continues to speak
for itself.” It speaks also for the exceptionally
capable management of the office—which capable
management is, of course, claimed to be one of the
results of its profit-sharing constitution. In addition
to the Widows’ Fund the M.L.C. also includes the
M.L.A. (Mutual Life of Australia), another old and
highly-respectable mutual office which somehow wasn’t
able to shake things up. A little while before the
amalgamation this office had to pass a bonus alto-
gether. For the past year there is £47,083 to be
divided, so there are Hallelujahs from that
quarter, too. The shareholders take no bite out of
these A.W.F. or M.L.A. bonuses. Their profits (if
any) come from working the business of those old
offices at less than the agreed-upon rate. Presumably
there is a profit, seeing that this year there is from
this and other sources £28,359 to divide from the
Ordinary branch; yet even after allowing for that
profit the bonuses in the A.W.F. and M.L.A. show
the great improvement indicated above. And if
there is a profit for the shareholders in the trans-
ferred business there must be four times more for the
policy-holders.
Safety is the great thing in an insurance concern.
True, you can get some of your money back if you
surrender a policy after it has been in force a few
years; but that leaves you without the insurance. It
isn’t like depositing money with a bank: you will
draw that out in three years at most, or leave it
there only after reconsidering the bank’s position.
With a life-insurance policy you must trust the office
to be good not three years hence, but perhaps 40
years hence; and the paying-back will be done most
likely when you are too dead yourself to see that you
are getting a square deal. Hence the great import-
ance of seeing (1) that the office’s assets are right;
(2) that its reserves are right; and (3) that its
management generally is right. (I)Twice within the
last, seven years this office’s assets have been over-
hauled, and it is impossible to conceive of any
businesslike amalgamation except on the basis of the
assets being on both sides written down to their cold
value. (2) Reserves in an insurance office are the
amount set aside towards meeting the liabilities under
the policies. Whether those reserves are right or not
depends very largely on the rate of interest which it
is assumed they will earn. In the M.L.C. a 3 p.c.
rate is assumed. The actual average earnings last
year were £4 13s. The difference was available for
bonuses and providing for contingencies. (3) This
isn’t a mutual office. Policy-holders don’t govern it.
The management is in the hands of shareholders. The
shareholders have put up £88,864 of capital and are
liable for another £112,000, and that, besides being a
bit extra guarantee that the policies are all right,
should be some sort of guarantee that the manage-
ment won’t be put in the hands of incompetents.

This was once the Citizens’ big department; but
there is keener competition now in that field, and
the progress to-day, though solid, is not rapid. The
cost is high, as it must be. when premiums are small
and have to be chased from house to house. Last
year expenses, including dividends, absorbed £3B
15s. 9d. p.c. of the income. It is poor insurance
that ; the only consolation is that the expense rate
is steadily coming down. Still, the policyholder gets
little or no benefit from that. He gets a contract —
“for so much a week we will pay you so much at
death,” or at some specified age. The co. offers no Indus-
trial bonuses ; the insurer knows what he will get—
that much and no more. Also, it is some advantage to
know that he will certainly get no less unless the
whole thing goes bung and the shareholders lose all
their capital.
Hitherto the co. has been carrying on an Accident
business. It still takes accident policies; but all
the risks of that kind are now reinsured. Twelve
months ago it was said here that a life office
shouldn’t take accident risks (which can’t be
measured) ; and as the M.L.C. has lately opened up
business in Canada, and as Canada has put the view
expressed here 12 months ago into law, the M L.C.
now passes its accident risks on to others, though,
of course, it is still responsible to the people to
whom it issues the contracts.

It was always hard to know what to do with those

reserved profit; but that part was lumped with other
things. For instance, reserve for “equalisation of
dividends” was flung into the heap with the staff super-
annuation fund, which is merely a debt owing by
the co. The heap grew as follows:

This dubious lot was additional to the sure and
certain reserves. Early last year the directors decided
to put the shipping and coal interests into separate
cos., and make this co. appear chiefly as a co. with
large investments in other cos. That meant revaluing
the assets, in order to fix the capital of the new
concerns; and an attempt is made in the first table
to show the result. The £772,779 consists of (1)
unrecognisable reserves previously included in the
before-mentioned heap; (2) values in excess of the
co.’s book-values, and paid for by shares in the new
subsidiary cos. ; and (3) whatever profits may have
been socked away during the past year as “provision
for depreciation and contingencies.”
The capital has not been altered during the year:
it stand at £750,000, of which £500,000 is 5 p.c.
pref. As the pref. capital is so large and is limited
to 5 p.c., the ordinaries’ pot of honey is very fine
and sweet —except in the case of a smash, of course,
when the prefs. would smother them. When sub-
sidiary cos. are put off and the assets and reserves
of the parent co. are swollen by the face value of
the shares in the subsidiaries, it is generally a wise
thing to sniff hard. For instance, an insurance co.
in a poor way formed a co. to take over one of its
side-lines, and sold the business for (say) £50,000.
That £50,000 was then included among the assets,
and the reserves got a magnificent lift; but the origi-
nal co. really wasn’t 2d. better off, the whole
£50,000 being represented by paper which nobody
wants. In this Howard Smith case, however, the
capital of the new cos. seems to have been based
on a valuation of the hard, tangible assets, and there
is no goodwill or other froth in the two principal
lines included in the big item, “Shares in other
cos. at valuation, £1,778,582.” An improvement
might be made there: that “at valuation” is danger-
ous. Another sort of Board might some day bump
up a year’s profits by writing up the shares ; hence,
so far as the newly acquired shares, at any rate,
are concerned, “at face value, or under” would be
a safer entry.
The co. doesn’t hold much now except the shares
in other cos. ; the total assets are £2,031,275, and
the shares represent £1,778,582. Most of the differ-
ence consists of book debts and plant used in the co.’s
business as managing agents for the subsidiary ship-
ping and coal cos. This managing agency must be
worth something. From the two big subsidiary cos.,
representing about £1,570,500 of the assets, its
divs. were about £92,800. But the total income
from all sources, after providing for depreciation
and contingencies, was no less than £206,960 ; and
exes, ran to £55,504. A 5 p.c. div. all round on
the shares in the two subsidiary cos. would give
this co. enough to pay 5 p.c. on its own prefs. and
20 p.c. on its ordinaries, even if the other assets
brought in nothing and the agency business merely
paid exes. With fair luck the ordinaries should,
therefore, wallow in dividends. Shareholders may
even wallow in a bonus one of these days.

Caledonian Collieries, Ltd. —The Cale-
donian Coal Co. was formed in 1895, and acquired
the West Wallsend, West Wallsend Extended, Wara-
tah, Aberdare and Aberdare Extended Collieries, at
Newcastle (N.S.W.). The Cotton Coatses were big
shareholders (there were only a handful of them
altogether), and the Howard Smith Co., which was
the Caledonian’s managing agent, was the largest if
not the only Australian holder. The co. was regis-
tered in - Glasgow. Negotiations for the purchase of
the other interests by the Howard Smith Co. were
completed 12 months ago, and Caledonian Collieries,
Ltd., was then formed with an authorised capital of
£2,000,000. The Howard Smith Co. took 600,000
ordinary and 190,000 cum. pref. shares, and another
50,000 cum. pref. shares were offered at par to the
Howard Smith shareholders individually—one for
every 15 in the old co. Of course, they were taken.
A further 50,000 of the Howard Smith Co.’s shares
in the Collieries were offered later in the year at
21s. The Howard Smith Co. apparently hadn’t quite
enough funds to carry through the big deal on a
cash basis. Hence these issues. The total paid
capital of the Collieries now is £852,507 —-
£252,500 in cum. pref. shares, £600,007 in ordi-
naries. The prefs. are entitled to a fixed 6 p.c.
cumulative, with 1 p.c. for each 1 p.c. paid on
ordinaries beyond 6 p.c. ; but the prefs. stop at 8
p.c. The business being a going concern, and the
coal market being brisk, the co. paid an interim
at the 8 p.c. rate for the first half-year, and repeats
the performance now. The barest accounts are pub-
lished ; they show a profit of £79,720 after provid-
ing unspecified amounts for depreciation and amortiza-
tion of leases; and preliminary exes, (also an un-
specified amount) are wiped right out. The 8 p.c.
all round calls for £67,528, so there is a surplus
of £12,192 for reserves. But already there wore
reserves of £33,098, though it is not possible
to say whether that is reserved profit earned by this
co., or is wholly or partly the accumulations of the
old co. Almost simultaneously with the formation
of Caledonian Collieries, Ltd., Australian Steamships,
Ltd., was formed to take over Howard Smith’s ship-
ping interests. The idea evidently is to make the
Howard Smith Co. a “holding” co., the better to
preserve secrecy with regard to the industrial opera-
tions of the co. However, the Collieries isn’t a
subsidiary co. in the ordinary sense, because 100,000
shares have been issued to individual shareholders in
the Howard Smith Co. ; hence, no doubt, the issue
of some details regarding the Collieries’ business.
But inasmuch as the profit mopped up ostensibly to
provide for depreciation, etc., is unknown, and various
other things are in doubt, all that can be said is
that, if no more and no less than the right amounts
have been put by, the year’s profits, after _ paying
the preliminary exes., were sufficient to give the
maximum 8 p.c. on the prefs., and what remained
fell a few pounds short of being enough to give the
ordinaries 10 p.c. The co.’s coal-land holding com-
prises 8025 acres freehold and 9231 acres leasehold
according to the latest information available.
Australian Steamships, Ltd.—Twelve
months ago the chairman of the Howard Smith Co. told
his shareholders that, “after long and careful con-
sideration,” the directors had resolved, “for several
material reasons,” to separate the co.’s shipping in-
terests from its other assets ; so Australian Steam-
ships, Ltd., was registered to take over, the steamers,
etc., as well as certain shareholdings in other ship-
ping cos. “The purchase price,” he said, “is to be
fixed by three independent qualified assessors. Their
valuation is to be satisfied by fully-paid up shares in
the new co. The directors of the Howard Smith Co.
constitute the first Board, and the Howard Smith
Co. has been appointed managing agents.” Steamers
and plant “at cost less depreciation”—-which means,
of course, cost to this co,, based on the valuation
above-mentioned —stand in the books at £768,012 ;
and other assets brought the total to £820,508,
which was the price paid (in shares) to the Howard
Smith Co. Five more shares were issued for cash —
evidently to secure the registration of the co.—so
the capital is £820,513, At the end of the first
half-year’s trading the directors announced a loss,
due to more pay and less work, It takes approxi-
mately 150 tons of shipping, it was alleged, to do
the work till lately done by 100 tons; and if the
figure is anything near the mark, it is a serious
matter. High wages are good. America found that
out long ago. But slack work isn’t good; it means
not only a reduction in the output, but a fearful
waste of capital. The interest on a ship that costs
£50,000 is (say) £8 per day, so every extra day
taken to load that ship means £8 less for either the
owners or the workers, or, if they get the same,
there is £8 more for passengers and freight to pay.
Naturally the owners don’t want to stand the racket;
and, as the workers won’t, the extra cost is passed
on to the customers, who were hit by advanced rates
in July. The result of that advance apparently has
been to improve the position; anyway, “after pro-
viding for depreciation and preliminary exes.,” a pro-
fit of £40,473 is shown —enough to pay 4 p.c. for
the year ( £32,821), and leave £7652 over. Figures
are not available to show whether all that profit
actually was made in the second half of the year,
and a bit over to cover the loss alleged to have
been made in the first half. If it was, then, seeing
that preliminary exes, have also been wiped out, the
co. is on a pretty good wicket now. Not that this
paper expects to be able to tell from the published
accounts how this co. is doing. If the directors
want the co. to wear a poor and worried look they
can easily do it by lopping an excessive amount off,
nominally to provide for depreciation, and nobody
who isn’t behind the counter can tell what the
amount is, and whether it is excessive or not.

To start with, the capital of the co., formed in 1902,
was £550,000 in £1 shares. But after the first
two or three years it looked as though the assets and
the goodwill * had been overvalued; so the trustees
of the two Toohey estates did a remarkable thing—
they handed back 50,000 shares and agreed that all
the others should be written down to 16s. The
writing-down really didn’t matter much, because,
after all, the co. was made neither richer nor poorer
thereby; but the cancellation of the 50,000 shares
was something very solid. As a matter of fact, the
other shares have recovered in value till they are
now worth well over the old 20s. in the market;
but the 50,000 shares have gone for ever. In the
writing-down at the 1905 revaluation goodwill was
taken to be worth £22,500. The directors at once
started to build up a fund out of profit to replace
that froth with something more solid, and the
whole £22,500 has been provided. The reserves
( £121,571) are exclusive of that provision, and
are now worth more than the 4s. per share which
was formerly written off. Certainly it is impossible
to say whether the capital and the reserves are all
represented by assets worth 20s. in the £, because
this is The Bulletin's busy day, and it can’t go
round and value the brewery, plant, rolling stock
and freehold and leasehold pubs and other pro-
perties. The lot are said to be worth £392,764.
But the management doesn’t look the sort that
would knowingly put too high a value on the assets.
It is practically the same management that erred on
the right side in 1905; it has consistently met all
expenditure in connection with the maintenance of
machinery and plant out of current revenue; and,
besides doing that, it has for a good while past
socked away £5OOO each half-year ostensibly to
cover depreciation of plant.
In spite of that, it is no doubt possible that there
may be flies in the beer. The co.’s holding of pubs
must be large; yet it is not plain that the lease-
holds are being written down. Also, the freehold
premises may be decaying, and it is not shown that
a fund is being provided for their replacement. But
on the general appearance of things, it seems fairly
safe to say that Tooheys, Ltd., is attending to these
matters. Certainly the management of the indus-
trial concern which in these days would inflate its
profits by making insufficient provision for wear and
tear, etc., would be either a fool or a rogue;
and Tooheys’ management isn’t credited with being
either. Moreover, as a set-off against the deprecia-
tion of pubs owing to loss of license, there is an
unquestioned appreciation in other directions. In
1902, when this co. was formed, there was one pub
in N. S. Wales for every 444 residents. In 1911
(latest figures available on this point) there were
599 residents to each pub ; and an extra 155 throats
to gargle must add something to the value of a
license and to the rent-value of the pub which
carries the license. This seems to be supported by
one line (“rent and interest”) towards the bottom
of the following comparison:—

Book debts are heavy; but the turnover has no
doubt grown very much even in five years. These
are times when Bill, lifting his week’s pay, feels
himself entitled to another pint. There are not
many people who get a bigger dividend out of the
country’s extra prosperity (fictitious and otherwise)
than the brewer and his smaller cousin, Bung. Con-
versely, there are not many whose profits will be
cut into worse when the bottom falls out of the
borrowing boom —especially if it drops out in a bad
season.

For very many years past the capital had been £99,000
in 5500 £2O shares paid to £lB. Lately, the co.
being driven to do something more than play with
the electric-lighting side of its business, 500 more
shares were issued at a small premium ; and a quar-
ter’s dividend is paid on this lot. The money and
a good deal besides has been put into electric plant.
Six months ago the more or less fixed assets on this
side of the business stood in the books at £17,594;
now they represent £44,660. Extra share capital
supplied £9OOO ; £BOOO more has been raised on
debentures, which now total £20,000 ; and the over-
draft, which was £4642 six months ago, is £11,717
now. In the past, the co. seems to have supplied
electric current merely to keep others out of the
business, and apparently never tried to make a com-
mercial success of it. Then the Hydro-Electric scheme
connected with the Big Lake came along, and this
gas co. must have shivered. But luck stood to it ;
the Hydro-Electric’s finances failed, and the Gas Co.
jumped in and took over the other’s reticulation
scheme for Hobart. So it breathes again, though
now, spurred on by the City Council, it has to really
do something. Profits in excess of the dividend have
hitherto been small, and there is no sign of any con-
siderable amount being stuffed away anywhere; hence,
unless the new electric business can supply extra pro-
fits, there is nothing to hope for in the way of an
early increase in the dividend.

That is the best that can be made of this muddle.
Like the other cos. supplying Sydney and Newcastle
and their suburbs this one fell under the Gas Act
1912, and was given a chance to capitalise its re-
serves before being put on a 10 p.c. div. basis. On
Dec. 31, 1912, the reserves (including unappropri-
ated profit) were £Bl7l. On Jan. 31, 1913, after
the revaluation, they were £16,264, irrespective of
the month’s profit; and out of that a div. of £2185
was paid. Thus the assets were apparently written
up £8093, and £14,079 in all remained after pay-
ing the dividend. The directors said on Feb. 7,
1913, that they would pay a bonus of 20 p.c., which
would absorb £9150. There should then have been
£4929 of reserves left. But the balance-sheet now
issued shows reserves of only £1139, apart from the
past year’s profits, so that £3790 of alleged re-
serves have dropped out somewhere. Probably it
was written off, though why anything should be
written off immediately after the assets had been
written up isn’t clear. Probably the bonus
amounted to more than £9150. The record of the
whole transaction is sloppy and untidy. At the
same time as the 20 p.c. bonus was declared calls
were made on the partly-paid shares of the co. ; and
the consequent changes are shown in the next table.

The figures illustrate the very rapid growth of the
marine suburb ; and it hasn’t stopped yet,
and it isn’t going to stop. But, like the other cos.,
this one is pinned down pretty firmly to 10 p.c., no
matter how its business may grow. To pay another
1 p.c. it must lop 4d. per 1000 off the price of gas;
and that will take some doing. The best the share-
holders can hope for for a good while to come is the
maintenance of the 10 p.c.—and when you come to
think of it 10 p.c. is pretty solid when it is paid on
capital representing the full value of all the assets;
in other words, when it has no help from reserves,
visible or otherwise. On present appearances that
div. is safe enough.

look at the advantage! Honesty of construction is
the secret of “Pioneeer.” Strength, combined with

Efficient grinding is one of the many problems
that mine managers have to solve. The Hardinge
Conical Mills have proved to the Calumet and Hecla
Mining Co. that grinding is not such a difficult
problem ; they have installed 64 of them, and say
“the Hardinge Conical Mill is the most efficient
grinding machine we have yet gotten hold of.” If
they say this of the mills, it should be worth the
while of mine managers here to inquire about them.
The Austral Otis Eng. Co., Ltd., of Melbourne, are
the sole representatives for them in the Common-
wealth, and will be glad to forward particulars,* [1

Water-Supply Engineers will be interested to learn
that further evidence proving the durability of W. I.
and Steel Pipes when coated by the Asphaltum pro-
cess, has just been obtained by the engineers of the
Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, Certain
alterations were made to the main which supplies the
City of South Melbourne with water, and consequently
some pipes were taken up. These pipes were made in
the year 1889, and were coated with Asphaltum com-
position in the usual way, and they were laid in ground
that was particularly unfavorable to the preservation
of any unprotected metal, being originally swampy
land, containing much vegetable matter, and filled
with tidal dredgings. On examination, these 24-year-
old pipes were found to be in an excellent state of
preservation, and the Board’s engineers were so satis-
fied with their condition that they decided to use
them again. They were, therefore, removed to
the works of Messrs. Mephan, Ferguson Proprietary
Limited, at Footscray, Victoria, where these 24-year-
old pipes were cleaned, retested, and recoated with
Asphaltum composition in a new and improved pro-
cess. They are now being relaid in a position where
they will have to withstand a Working pressure of
1351b. to the square inch. That the Asphaltum pro-
cess for coating pipes is rust-proof and thoroughly
efficacious is proved by the foregoing.*

in the land-boom days ; and a good deal of foreclosed
property fell into the co.’s hands. Surplus profits
then were mopped up in writing down this incubus.
Gradually most of the properties were realised, no
doubt at their written-down values; and in 1900 or
thereabouts the co. with this money bought office
premises in Queen-street, and subsequently, as more
money was available, it spent nearly £20,000 on
additional building. To-day the co. owns these pre-
mises, which in all have cost £41,600, and the
mortgage has been quite got rid of. In addition, it
has £11,976 net of liquid assets, £5O on mortgage,
and foreclosed properties written down to £6149.
Though until the last three or four years the re-
serves have not shifted much, there has thus been a
lot of change so far as the assets are concerned ; but
actually how much better off the co. is it is im-
possible to say. And it isn’t possible to say either
what progress the business is making, the National
being one of the trustee offices which supply no infor-
mation regarding estates in hand. All one can do
is to guess from the table that, in the directors’
opinion, the assets are now written dowm to bedrock,
and the capital and funds are therefore intact. If
so, there is a shade under 16s. for each share. There
are 75,000 £2 shares paid up to Bs. As for profits,
the surplus, after paying the 10 p.c. div., is nowa-
days moderate, and gives what looks like a safe
margin. The div. is certainly quite large enougih,
but on the record of the past four years it ought
to be comfortably maintained even under less favor-
able conditions of trade. Unfavorable conditions of
trade don’t indeed affect a trustee co. as much as
they do most concerns, because Death calls in
whether wool is at 7d. or Is., and estates have then
to be administered. What does pinch them a bit is
that when property values are poor and rents, etc.,
are low, their commission earnings shrink; and,
occasionally, the moth makes holes in their own
investments.
If J. E. Scantlebury can’t make a mine
he can at least make a report, and if he can’t pay
dividends he can at least hold out glorious hopes.
His managing director’s report on the Amalgamated
Hill End (N.S.W.), is the breeziest, brightest piece
of official mining literature of the year. In a devia-
tion from the main level north of the deep-level
tunnel the co. has got its best prospects. Says
Scantlebury: “Unquestionably a distinct change of
country has taken place at this level, and as far
as we are able to judge, it is a replica or recurrence
of the gold zone of country in which the great
bonanzas were found over 40 years ago about 400 ft.
higher up. In this new make of country we have
not only the reappearance of the mica vein, but we
have the same heavy, laminated, greasy black slates
of the old period. Whether we shall have a re-
currence of the gold also remains to be seen. This
year will tell the tale.... Don’t for one moment
imagine we shall leave the gold after all the trouble
we have had to find it. It will take a heap more
gold to satisfy me: 10,000 oz. from 10 tons of stone,
and as much more as you like, will give me some
satisfaction. Some day we will get it, and, we all
hope that day is not now far distant.” Meantime
the co, had on September 80 last £7056 of cash
and £Bl5 of book-debts, and it owed £2021 ; and
as the battery is running on vein stone, and as
the Government is giving £2 a foot towards sinking
a shaft below the tunnel, the bite into the'remaining
capital shouldn’t now be rapid. The whole thing is,
of course, still a gamble; but the co. is playing for
big stakes.
* * * . »
For a start the B. 11. South is putting in
a plant capable of handling 500 tons of slimes a
week; and, all going well,' it should be at work in
August. If the people in charge decide that this is
the sort of thing they want, three units will be
added. The Owen process (or the Owen adaptation
of the Minerals Separation process, whichever you
like) is to be used. A profit of £1 per ton has
been so far mentioned ; but that depends, of course,
on the price of metals. The co. is putting up a
sulphuric acid plant to supply its own flotation re-
quirements.
* * * *
J. M. Newman’s report to the Austral-
Malay Syndicate on Papuan dredging prospects makes
doleful reading for those who have lately put their
money into a Yodda Valley proposition. Chesser, a
prospector, had given Newman’s syndicate an option
to buy a claim adjoining the Yodda Valley Co.’s
holding for £4OOO. Being above the co.’s ground,
Chesser’s should be richer. Yet in a week’s boring
“we found nothing better than 4d. per yard. It is
obvious that, for a dredge to pay on the Yodda, 70
miles by road from its port and consisting of very
heavy bouldery and wet ground, values would
have to be exceptionally high. Up till now sufficient
testing has not been done by anyone to warrant
the statement that such values occur over more than
a few acres Of the Yodda.” However, if the Yodda
Co. fails with gold, it may have a chance with tim-
ber, as it is understood to have a fine forest con-
cession.
* * * *
The oil and acid flotation process is being
grabbed by all the big Australian copper mines. Wallaroo
and Moonta,' Great Cobar, Mount Lyell, Mount Morgan
are all experimenting. Great Fitzroy and Great
Cobar claim very high recoveries—up to 80 p.c. of
the copper contained in the crudes. Lloyd’s (N.S.W.)
is said to be treating coarse jig tailings to advan-
tage; and the Grafton (N.S.W.) is hopeful that this
kind of concentration will give it another lease of
life. Mount Lyell, with a handy supply of basic flux,
doesn’t urgently need the concentrator just now, but
the development of low-grade silicious ore at the
N. Lyell and the Comstock may make it valuable
presently. The process consists of reducing the ore
or other material to be treated to a pulp. This, in
a very sloppy state, is mixed with oil (crude eucalyp-
tus oil made from the “peppermint” is best) and
sulphuric acid. The acid attacks the metal particles,
and forms a tiny globule of gas, which acts as a
balloon and bring it to the surface, being helped there
by the oil. The scum at the top, containing the
metal, is floated off and dried, and is then ready for
the smelter.
* * * *
Still another change of management has
occurred at the Grafton Copper Mine (N.S.W.),
which closed down before Christmas and has only
lately reopened. The new regime is evidently to be
one of strict economy. The suction-gas power plant
is idle, hand labor being again resorted to under-
ground. Mining and smelting are both being carried
on in_ a much smaller way than previously. The
financial results of the year just ended must have
shown a balance on the wrong side, compared with a
profit of about £13,000 for the preceding year.
The chief and probably only reason for this is the
depletion of ore reserves through neglected develop-
ment.
Last year (1913) N.S.W. for the firsc.
time in its history had an average mineral production
of over £1,000,000 per month ( £12,095,084_f0r the
year). No less than three-fourths ( £9,063,857) was
for zinc and lead nroducts containing silver
( £5,721,854) and for coal (£3,342,003). Broken
Hill hauled 1,744,177 tons of crude ore, and N.S.W.
exported 6,231,724 tons of coal. A curious feature
of these returns is that the total quantity of metallic
zinc, lead and silver produced is unspecified; no
attempt is made to calculate the recoverable metals
contained in exnorted concentrates.

Assistant N.S.W. Government Geologist
Carne, the very experienced man whom the Com-
monwealth Government borrowed to report on the
mineral and oil possibilities of Papua, has given
evidence before the Inter-State Commission on the
question of oil prospects in N. S. Wales and Aus-
tralia generally. As to the Commonwealth Oil Cor-
poration he repeats what The Bulletin said long
ago—that the works were wrongly placed and enor-
mous sums of money wasted. Assuming that the
shale goes right through the hill —which, on the
three miles or so of tunnelling done, is a fair
assumption—Carne says it is the biggest known
deposit in the world. Like the other official geolo-
gists, he is not hopeful that oil wells will be dis-
covered anywhere in Australia; the S. Australian
indications he evidently regards as the least un-
promising.
Hargraves (N.S.W.), the oldest inhabi-
tant among Australian mining fields, stands a chance
of being born again. H. E. Pratten finds relaxation
from successful flotations of Malayan tin-dredgjing
propositions in directing the resurrection —it is
mainly his hard cash that has been going into the
mine during the past 18 months. The reefs are of
the “saddle” variety, and competent judges back the
Government opinion that the Hargraves reefs resemble
in detail their Bendigo brothers. Pratten’s scheme
seems to be to use his five head of stamps to test
the reefs, and, if possible, to earn small contribu-
tions to the development funds. The usual “English
company” had its day at Hargraves—its idea of
prospecting being to sink a 15ft. by sft. shaft away
from the saddles 300 ft. deep. Pittman advocates
the testing of “centre-country” for new saddles, and
driving on the known makes of stone.
* * * *
Latest crushings from Hill End (N.S.W.)
are 102 oz. gold from 100 tons of Reward stone,
and 200 oz. from an unstated quantity from the
Amalgamated. The latter was taken from the Alica
vein and Star of Peace reef, the existence of gold
in which inspires the belief that there is something
still further down. And so there might be.
* * * *
Amalgamated Hill End (N.S.W.) has
arrived at the unsatisfying conclusion that, if
there are any bonanzas left in the mine by the old-
time diggers, those bonanzas must be in deeper
ground than any yet worked by the co. And so at
last it joins the army of those who have come to
similar conclusions under similar circumstances. And
no doubt there will yet be many others who have
still to. learn that the miner of those old, despised
days, with his supposedly obsolete and inefficient
methods, knew sufficient of his business not to leave
a good thing when he was on it. The modern Amal-
gamated has spent £20,000 in finding this out. But
still some of its people go on talking about spending
as much more, . before throwing up the sponge. The
N.S.W. Mines Department’s subsidy of £30,000 for
the Turon River tunnel scheme, to prospect the deeper
region of Hill End, is once again the object of the
co.’s despairing gaze. But for the scheme itself the
co. frankly admits it has no time.
* * * *
Drake (N.S.W.) is much concerned as to
whether it will receive a new lease of life or drop
more dead than it has been. Its chief mine, the
Adeline, some 2j years ago fell into the hands of
the Cobar Longworths. Since then, a few miners
have been at work, but no ore has been treated.
Lately, however, a new manager came along. The
gist of his report is that a concentrating plant to
cost £BOOO or £lO,OOO must be installed, or the
shutters should be put up. Several other local
mines are feeling well, and the owners reckon that,
if the new plant arrives, the Good Samaritan who
owns it might treat their ores for a consideration.
Otherwise, owing to cost of treatment, they will
mostly be forced to follow the Adeline.
Occidental (N.S.W.) shares have been
influenced by reports about a payable streak of ore
at the 640 ft. level. It is hoped that a block of
ground will be opened for stoping between No. 6 and
No. 5 levels, and the official reports speak so highly
of the prospects that there is an occasional nibble
at this disappointing speculation. To the south of
the crosscut at the bottom level assays run up to
26dwt., and there is from 4ft. to sft. at the north
end averaging over 20dwt. But the heavy loss for
the half-year gave shareholders a shock, and shares
have been inclined to droop. The clean-up of 2640 z.
gold from 958 tons of slimes looks poor, but with
2280 z. in concentrates it may be payable.
Northern reports credit John Munro with
returning to his old love, the O.K. The latest
scheme is to work a group, embracing 0.K., Tartana,
Ango-Saxon, and a few other derelicts of North
Queensland. There may be a few tons of ore left in
the North 0.K., Surprise and South —but it is a
fairly safe guess that the O.K. plant will not treat
them at a profit. There is also quite a large quan-
tity of 1 p.c. ore at Tartana, and much has been
heard of a wet process for its extraction, but there
is little beyond this. And in any case smelting
propositions are scarcely at a premium in N.Q. just
now. J.M. appears to have a more cheerful prospect
with the gold mines. The old Anglo-Saxon has tra-
ditions of high values and extravagant management,
and this part of the scheme may repay him.
Mount Hector, once the most promising of
the Carmindah, Glassford Creek group, and the last
to fizzle out, is being scrapped, several thousand
pounds worth of plant having recently been bought up
by a Brisbane syndicate for fewer hundreds. This
syndicate had an idea of reopening the mine, but
repented. The final scenes recall a lost opportunity,
when, during the days of high copper prices, negotia-
tions were almost completed for an English company
to take over Hector and Glassford. Each company
considered its show infinitely superior to the other
fellow’s. While they were quarrelling over the bone
that article of food took its passage back to England.
The Mount Morgan Extended Co., which
has stuck manfully to the task of locating the Mount
Morgan “lode,” in the Extended Co.’s property, an-
nounced recently that the goal had apparently been
won. Now it finds that so far values are too low
to be of any use —copper 1 p.c. and gold ldwt.
Nevertheless the company appears to be quite satis-
fied that this is the lode, and wants only further de-
veloping to find payable ore.
Recently Great Fitzroy (Q.) for a while
—a little while—managed to show a profit of some
kind, based on copper when copper was fairly high.
As remarked in last issue, when copper descended
the profit went with it. After that came a glissade
of losses. And now, again, the run has been inter-
rupted by the appearance of a profit for February, a
very small one—£2o2—which disappears entirely oh
closer acquaintance, being merely a mirage of finance.
* * * *
Hampden’s smelting return of 583 tons of
copper from 6332 tons of ore testifies to the continu-
ance of the treatment of ore higher than the aVerfige
of the reserves. In addition to the Ore proper, 565
tons of customs ore and 909 tons of metal-bearing
flux from the Salmon were smelted. These contained
between them 62 tons of copper, and, allowing for
slag loss, the copper recovered from them would be
roughly 53 tons. Thus 4767 tons of ore yielded 530
tons of copper, equal to an extraction of 11.1 p.c.
copper. Ore reserves, according to last estimate,
average 10 p.c. copper, assay value, and the extract-
able value, of course, is lower still. That is one
side of the matter. The other is that the grade of
the ore now being treated may not be so much
higher than that of the real reserves, for as the esti-
mate includes a lot of low-grade stuff that won’t be
treated at a profit for many a day to come, the
remainder that can be treated must be obviously
higher than 10 p.c., unless the estimate is hopelessly
wrong. But to have to cut out a swag of 60,000
tons from reserves that are none too plentiful has
just about as unpleasant a significance as the first
aspect mentioned. You take your choice.
* * * *
Brilliant Deeps, Charters Towers, are de-
pressed because of the irregularity of the returns and
the diminishing ore reserves. The fortnightly clean-
up of 348 tons gave £1366, an average of £3 18s. 6d.,
which follows an average of £5 2s. Bd. from 675
tons. The bottom of the underlay shaft shows nothing
payable at 105 ft. below No. 6, and efforts to pick
up a reef in hanging-wall country from No. 5 level
have been disappointing. Crushings taken out last
year gave a good average of over £4 per ton. Of
course if No. 7 level, shortly to be opened, turns out
as good as No. 6 did, or if a payable shoot is met
in hanging-wall country, there will be a revival; but
at the moment there is nothing to indicate that either
of these things will happen.
Mount Oxide (Q.) is hastening but
slowly. The consultation of Corbould and Williams
resulted in an adit being driven into the big
hematite body some distance north of the old work-
ings. An the end of this adit a 12 x 4 shaft is
being sunk. As all the rich shoots are dipping
north, and the iron is cupriferous, the drills may
bore into pyritic ore any day. There are many
thousands of tons of ore exposed in the old workings
on the hanging-wall side, but the footwall country
is an unknown quantity. It takes time and money
to develop a lode channel some 200 ft. wide.
* * * *
Chaffers (W.A.) is getting a move on with
its new plant, and hopes to start treating 7000 tons
a month before long. Meanwhile the mine is being
kept before the public by stories of what the co. is
going to do in the shape of profit-earning when the
mill starts. If recent official assays and ore estimates
are right, fair profits ought to be earned for some
time; but whether they will reach the shareholders or
will be used up in the hunt for more ore is another
matter. Everything hinges on what the real average
of the mine as indicated by mill returns turns out to
be.
Commodore (W.A.) has wound up another
half-year without having anything to give shareholders.
However, it now has a bit of money in hand, and
with ordinary luck it may pay out a trifle at the
end of the current six months. Cash assets total
about £3500, and nearly 10,000 tons of residues
assaying 15s. 6d. per ton await treatment. Much
depends on how the reef shapes in depth. A lot of
money has lately been spent on development at No.
4 level with disappointing results, but the usual
hope is entertained that the ore channel will lose
its present sickly appearance and show a marked
improvement in deeper ground.
* * * *
Oroya Links’ superintendent (W.A.) has
been telling the London board that, although the
lode is at present in country usually unfavorable to
gold deposition, it is proving persistent and gives
promise of being the exception that doesn’t prove
the rule. He regards the position as quite satisfac-
tory, and is confident of being able to jog along and
do about as well as at present for a long time to
come. The co. has its eye on a block adjoining the
Croesus Prop, lease, which is believed to hold a con-
tinuation of the Eclipse lode, and is willing to
acquire it at a price. Another adjacent block which
is alleged to listve some of the same shoot is being
offered to London, but there isn’t enough in it to
warrant flotation.
* * * *
Westralia’s only coalfield, Collie, produced
314,090 tons in 1903, or 19,000 tons more than in
1912. Principal contributors in tons were: Co-opera-
tive, 75,817 ; Cardiff, 75,659 ; Scottish, 48,961; and
Proprietary, 41,191. Nearly the whole of the out-
put for these collieries was obtained by means of
electric-cutting machines. Average number of men
employed last year was 545.
Golden Butterfly (W.A.) is having the
struggle that this paper predicted. Last half-year
£7844 was recovered, but when all expenditure was
charged up, there was practically nothing left. Ore
reserves are guessed at 10 months’ supply; but
despite the apparent good work that is being done
by the management, there will probably be no real
profit earned from the treatment of this asset. Like
a good many other mines that The Bulletin knows
of, the Butterfly will no doubt go on finding employ-
ment for a number of men, keep a little community
with its pub, parson and undertaker going, and be a
good customer to the Government and traders of the
West for a long time; but the shareholders will not
get fat.
* * * *
Bullfinch (W.A.) is still tumbling, and,
according to some prophets, it is in imminent danger
of breaking its neck. This month’s return is tipped
to show another drop, and anxious shareholders are
wondering when the fall is going to end. Perhaps
it would be just as well if, at this belated hour, the
management said what average can be maintained and
have done with it; for if the present like-or-lump-what-
we-give-you policy is continued much longer, no one
will have anything to do with the stock at all.
Apart from what the old workings and the northern
series contain, there is a lot of 265. and 275. ore in
the mine, and this is probably what the grade will
have to come down to in the future, unless some
more sweetening is found.
On December 31 last Great Boulder Prop.
(W.A.) reckoned it had 652,916 tons of ore in sight,
the gross gold contents of which were estimated at
448,214 oz. fine, valued at £1,904,909. This is
37,802 tons and £118,091 less than was said to be
visible 12 months previously, and £254,091 short
of what there was two years ago. Estimating total
costs at 30s. per tori and deducting ss. per ton loss
in residues, the reserves are equivalent to about
9s. 4d. per share profit in sight. Next year’s figures
threaten to show a large shrinkage compared with
those just issued, as comparatively little or nothing
in the shape of payable ore is being opened up in
the bottom levels, and much less than formerly is
being developed up above.

Young bloods are still handicapping the
Victorian State coal mine. Almost every week work
is hung up on some pretext, or another. Many of
these stoppages are pure devilment, or the outcome
of false sympathy for the loafing lot. Cannot fire-
brands see that there must be restraint? If they
won’t act with sense, they will put the pot on the

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, Makcii 9, 1914.
My Dear Arini, —
To look like a helpless, weary bundle of
old clothes is what fashion is trying to
make us do. Some of the autumn shows
give you this notion, also set you wondering
as to how on earth you can ever get into
the said clothes. “How does this fasten;
or, find the placket hole?” is the puzzle
picture title suggested by the rags now on
view. They do look awful rags, though
priceful. No woman can possibly hope to
change her shape enough to wear any of the
coming season’s frocks to advantage unless
she changes her corsets. The new figure
line shows a swaddled effect round the feet
and ankles. Above everything is bunched
panier wire “just anyhow,” with the bunchi-
ness in front. No waist, or, rather, too
much waist, is the dictum of to-day. When
you are all waist you have no waist at all,
just as nobody was anybody in the country
where everybody was somebody. Corset-
makers’ booklets preach in the most im-
portant literary style they can command. The
new corsets “give perfect freedom to the
hips,” they are “very low in the bust,” and
“are free from side springs arid steels.” (I
quote the booklet.) You’d think that no
corset at all was indicated. But not so.
This foundation is even more necessary to a
sloppy exterior than was the steel cage of
the days when woman used to break in two
with a little extra pressure. “Another very
prominent feature is the disappearing waist
line” —a sentence which looks like a hard
saying. How can a “disappearing” any-
thing be a prominent feature? It vaguely
suggests the case of the lady who suddenly
continued quite still, looking at vacancy,
and only woke ,up when nothing happened
all at once. If anybody knows where a
completely disappeared waist-line is on view
an artist will be sent along, and this letter
will be illustrated next week.
Marjorie Williamson doesn’t intend to
visit Australia yet awhile. She is too comfy
where she is, being fixed up at a very high-
toned school in Paris. Among the allure-
ments of this up-to-date seat of feminine
learning, pupils are allowed to keep their
own motor-cars. Marjorie does so, and can
drive herself. She is now just at the very
outside edge of her teens, and has the name
of being a much-sought-after person. Her
admirers are numerous, but, of course, are
kept at a discreet distance.
The medical Taylor-Youngs—papa, mama,
and a more or less large baby or so —are
somewhere off our coast on their way from
a year in foreign capitals.
Mrs. J. C. Williamson, in a letter re-
ceived here the other day, says that she will
be leaving London in April for this less
fog-striclcen land.
Eugenics is an interfering kind of science
which seems to be inclined to butt in only
when it can upset nicely-planned marriage
arrangements and separate two loving
hearts. Already there is talk of the new
science aforesaid getting in its deadly work
over a smashed-up naval engagement. The
lover is a It.A.N. lieut. and the lady’s papa
broke the affair off, as he considered
his daughter too delicate to marry.
Two other broken engagements are just now
added to the above. In each case the fair
one was fickle and came from (or didn’t
come from) the other side of the world.
One girl got to Sydney harbor, and when
the young man climbed aboard the liner,
after having gone to Watson’s Bay the
night previous and slept there in order
to be able to greet his ladylove bright
and early, she told him, “All is over between
us. I love another.” Or words to that effect.
Her language wasn’t exactly that of Mrs.
Jones when she denounced her Pirate be-
cause she found that his. friend Thomson
was really Thompson, but the result was the
same.
Mr. J. G. Mills, of Lindfield, the elderly
parent of six nice daughters, called those
daughters together quite recently and told
them of his approaching marriage to Miss
Read, head of a business college, which posi-
tion she is relinquishing. The wedding will
take place early in April. Lynn Mills, the
plump and pleasing vocalist, will go to Eng
land yoon after seeing her parent off on his
honeymoon.
Some quaint things happened when the
Medical Congress was on its tour to Auck-
land. A doctor’s daughter on board went to
her mother’s room after sailing and whis-
pered excitedly that a mistake must have
been made about her cabin, as on the second
of the two berths were a suit of pink pyjamas
and a panama hat. But the horrified pa.rent
made inquiries and found out that the
articles belonged to a lady doctor of Bris-
bane. So all was again peace.
On the bar beach at Newcastle the muni-
cipal wiseacres have perpetrated a cruel
joke on the she-surfer. There are two
dressing-sheds for persons of our sex. one
conspicuously labelled “WOMEN ONLY,”
and the other “LADIES ONLY.” It is a
never-ending source of mild amusement to
the male beachcomber to watch the embar-
rassment of the feminine gender in deciding
which shelter to patronise. Shall she brand
herself as unladylike and go to the
“women's” retreat, or shall she proclaim her-
self unwomanly, and seek the “ladies’ ”
refuge? It’s a nice point, but the genteel
“ladies’ ” sanctuary usually wins.
The warships fill up Farm Cove nicely,
quite populating the bare places where they
were not, when they were awav filling other
bare places in other Australian harbors.
Even the lawns at Admiralty House are
looking greener than they did a week ago,
whether as the result of recent rain, or of a
fresh upspringing because the Admiral and
his family will soon be taking up their abode
at Ivirribilli I’oint, I know not. At the end
of this month Mrs. Patey and family will
arrive, and there are many other, indications
that Sydney is socially turning in its sleep
and giving a few grunts preliminary to wak-
ing up for the season. Next week it will
probablv be sufficiently aroused to look
under the bed for burglars.
Maggie and Lena Chisholm said good-bye
to a packed house at Concordia Hall last
week. As winner of the Emmeline Woolley
Scholarship last year, Miss Maggie had to
do something to show that she had every
mechanical piano-player beat, and when she
got going at the concert grand she certainly
proved that she knew her scales and her
Czerny. Her short-skirted sister played well
on the violin. Wm. McMillan arose to re-
mark that, by helping to send girls like the
Chisholm sisters to England to study, we are
helping to send Australia into the vanguard
of the musical world, and everybody agreed
with loud clappings.
The Emmeline Woolley Scholarship, which
was established in memory of that sound
musician, is tenable for two years, and is
not of sufficient money-value to support en-
tirely its holder. It involves travel and
study in an old-world centre. The Chis-
holms are rapidly putting together a sub-
stantial purse to help them along the
expensive path of the aspiring musician.
They will leave on March 25, and, before
that, they will give some concerts up North.
Mr. and Mrs. Ward (the latter was Mrs.
J. .1. Macken) intend shortly to leave for
a trip to various spots on this globe. Mr.
Ward has been for long a friend of the
family of his bride, having been an especial
chum of the lady’s late husband. The
newly-weds will steer their barque for
China, in which land hubby has friends or
relatives or some kind of persons of cordial
intent in the diplomatic service, so the tra-
vellers will probably have a good time. Mrs.
Macken, though the mother of a marriage-
able girl, has a figure her debutante
daughter might envy. Also her frocks are
always chosen, in unerring taste; but her
chiefest charm is. her Irish wit. She .is
easily one of the first rank as an entertain-
ing talker, and her brightness is quite spon-
taneous. She never polishes laboriously at
her repartee till it sparkles.
An expert tells me in confidence, and so I
immediately repeat it, that nobody Tangoes
in Sydney yet. There is a class of a few
enthusiasts who struggle with the intricacies
of that dance of many motions under the
able tuition of Minnie Hooper. But the only
new dance done at balls is the “Rag”—the
innumerable variations of the one-step. We
have all heard lately of clever girls and alert
youths who “picked up the Tango, my dear,
in positively two lessons in their own back
verandah.” Now, we will cast the shadow
of doubt on their brilliant exploits.
A fortnight of rabbit-diet has forced upon
us the trt#th that as a food bunny is as tedi-
ous as a twice-told tale. The rabbit’s true
vocation is a pasture destroyer. As a pest
he is conspicuously in his role, but as pro-
vender he is a complete and utter failure.
It seems perhaps rather ungrateful to turn
him down when, but for his aid, we might all
have starved, but if ever the cow and sheep
strike does end, no more rabbit! Still the
rabbit trappers need not fear. A constant
demand for bunny exists. He makes a good
emigrant when dead. The best thing to do
with him is to put him in a tin and export
him to feed the young British soldier.
The sad sight of seven or eight old ladies
in a boarding-house sitting-room, all snap-
ping at each other because they can’t get
the best chair near the fire, has led some
kindly-disposed persons to try and whoop up
enough money to build a house wherein such
ladies as like a fireside, or at least half a
fireside each, may attain that, luxury at
little cost. The idea of keeping house
together is not one that appeals to all elderly
women. Many of them would rather be with
young folk, who wish them in Jericho, as a
general thing—not that Jericho is much of a
place for the aged. But the plan, as above
hinted at, is an excellent one. “The Twi-
light Home” is the pensive title to be affixed
to the roost. A ball with this laudable estab--
, lishment in view, will be held in the Town
Hall on April 16. That energetic Society
woman, Mrs. Gordon Wesche, is one hon.
sec., and Miss Sylvia Waugh is another.
Fancy sets, which will doubtless- draw a big
gallery, will be undertaken by Mrs. Macneil
Simpson, Mrs. Macarthur Onslow, Mrs.
Edward Merewether and Mrs. Leonard
Dangar—names of prowess and renown
when affixed to any ball committee list.
Do you notice how busy all the girls are
at crochet or knitting? It is because they’re
resolved either to make a spoon or spoil a
horn. If they can’t manage a golf coat, per-
haps their more or less fairy fingers will
turn out a decently distinct pattern on an
embroidery edging. There is a crochet craze
on. Girls are trying to make the trimming
for their autumn blouses. It’s most fascin-
ating work. A skilful worker can crochet
two shoulder pieces, each breaking off into
two long sleeve insertions, -in fine cotton.
They look, Avhen made up, the cutest ever.
You’d never guess the blouse cost anything
under five guineas. Then they do a lovely
camisole ton in tiny squares. 25 to one
yoke: also a “la rose” yoke for a low-cut
neck, which you must put on over the head,
because it has no back or front opening. This
is just about the only way to get any dis-
tinction into clothes nowadays, when every
idea is exploited at the ready-to-wear counter.
If you want anything a little different you
must make it yourself.
Punched embroidery work, ornamented with
many stitches, such as “tent” and "net” and
“satin,” makes lovely applique for that funny
little basque that finishes off the baggv coat
of to-day. “Catalan” work,” it is called.
Colonel Burns and his two daughters, Miss
Dibbs and her niece, Miss Nina Massie, Mrs.
S. Hordern, sen., and Mr. and Mrs. Anthony
Ilordern, all returned to th.s city last week
after jaunts to foreign parts.
Mrs. John Scaddan, who departed for the
West along with her husband, Premier John,
on Sunday night, was the guest of honor at
a party given by Premier and Mrs. Holman
at Parliament House on Friday. Mrs.
Holman has many times played the role of
hostess in the Premier’s apartments, which,
under the present regime, have lost their dull
official look, and become quite a smart little
suite, with soft carpets, easy chairs, hand-
some sideboards and other sundries. Bright-
ened with flowers the rooms, which open out
on to a sizeable lawn, looked their best orl
Friday. If the powers would only have that
ugly fence in Macquarie-street razed to the
ground, the old buildings behind it would not
look half bad, because the gardens are always
beautifuly kept, and nobody except M’sP.
has a peep at them, unless when Mrs. Holman
gives a party. The guests were mostly offi-
cial, anti of course included the notable Mrs.
K. Dwyer, who is a tower of strength to
whatever political party she supports. Mrs.
Holman wore black charmeuse, Mrs. Scad-
dan pale fawn.
An important meeting pushed along ar-
rangements for the forthcoming Olympic Ball
to such a degree that success appears quite
visibly in the offing. The Mayoress moth-
ered the meeting at the rooms in . the Town
Hall last Thursday. Men as well as women
rolled up, the light of battle in their eye,
and all ready to speak a piece on the slight-
est provocation. Considering the sporty
nature of the festivity, which is to raise funds
to send teams to the next Olympic Games,
all suggestions took on a flavor that sug-
gested games. Fancy sets are what the
public likes, in the way of gallery draws, and
sets that will justify the adjective were
enthusiastically discussed. Any sports in
which women take part were seized upon at
once, and Miss Daisy Jerome, in an emerald-
green hat and a black gown, earmarked a
set for her own. Darling Pointers were at
the meeting, as well as the purely sporting
element, such at Kathleen and Mary Durack
and Mrs. H. D. Mclntosh.
Feeding the brute caused much discussion
at the meeting. The Supper always cuts a
big hole in the money bag, so that much of
the profit falls through and is lost. There
. have been instances known where the profits
have been swallowed up along with the sup-
per and the worthy “Cause” has not bene-
fited to the extent of a ham sandwich. Aide
Layton arose, and in honeyed words laid
bare a Machiavellian plot about this ball.
He urged with fiendish cunning that “light
refreshments only” should be served, and
that this should be kept a dark secret, the
blackness of which would only be equalled
by the state of the supper room on the event-
ful evening. But “no supper, no ball” is the
recognised motto of our charity-ball goers.
While they dance they must have the thought
of that liver wing to sustain them or else
collapse from exhaustion.
Mrs. Martin Dofiohoe has been busy all
this time making notes which she will write
up when she gets back to Paris. She will
leave by the Orama. Facts are chiefly what
this accurate penwoman is hunting, and she
has been' looking for them all over the State,
making various excursions to notable spots.
Besides facts, she has found friends, and at
many a good, man’s feast has been a wel-
come guest
The Prestons are on the wing for Europe,
having let their big house—Warinella, at
North. Sydney—which they bought from
Edmund • Barton and much enlarged. They
will stay at a city hostelry till they sail.
Two recent weddings, that of their son to
Miss Pearly Smith and tlieih daughter td
Mr. Roy King, have much reduced theif
family circle. The Prestons made all their
money in a very few years in the west.
The wedding of Miss Isabelle Maddtell,-
of Bede Yale, Braidwood, will be an event
of the week, March 10 being the happy day.
The wedding feast will be held at the Cairo,
Macleay-street, which is not too far from
St. James’ for guests to grow very hungry
en route. The bride’s sisters, Thelma and
May, were hostesses at a farewell tea party
at Farmer’s one day last week. The" bride-
groom’s name —-as an afterthought—is Mr.
Edgar Downes, whose people dwell at Cam-
den.
Several of the usual prominent Easterites
have already taken up their lodging in the
city, which promises to be very gay when
things once get going. Bananalandefs who
have arrived and mean to stay include Mrs.
Raff and her daughter, Mrs. Hyslop, Mrs.
A. McGowan and Mr. and Mrs. A. Feez.
The Frank Kings, from Cooma, are at
Manly.
Girls gathered in their hundreds to say
“good-bye” to their beloved Florence Brough
mi Friday. With her husband Mrs. Bell
is saying “an revoir,” and she will be here
anon (as they say in tin l play). Always
sympathetic and unaffected. Mrs, Brough
was the first of our leading ladies to tap
the affections of the great girl-public, an
until then almost entirely unexploited field
of theatrical appreciation.
Mrs. Trough deserves all the eirl worship
she gets, and any other aged admiration that
is lying around waiting for a worthy object.
But it is amusing to notice how girls make
or mar the popularity of a stage darling of
either sex'. The feminine star likes her fol-
lowing of fluttering moths lust as well when
they are of her own sex. It has a good box-
office end to it, for the matinde,. now so
usual, brings out the girl admirers in a sol d
army, and the financial thermometer rises
lip to the boiling neighborhood.
Mrs. Edmund Resell, who arrived last
Week from Germany with her husband, after
five years abroad, drove up to their fine
house—Swifts, Darling Point—to find it
empty. The whole household staff had
vamoosed. In other words, the menials had
given themselves the sack. _ There was no-
body even to make a cup of tea for the re-
turned travellers. Mrs. Resell could not so
much as find a “char” at 6s. the day. So
liow she feels inclined to pack up again and
go back to Europe.
Irby Marshall, the tall and impressive
divorcee of this revival of Napoleon’s matri-
monial troubles, at the Theatre Royal, went
on the stage originally as a beauty girl. For
some time She has been absent from Sydney
and has been touring with her own co. in
other parts of the Commonwealth. After
this season it is her intention to go to the
United States, and aim at making good
there..
Mr. and Mrs. Voh Goes have gone into
a flat at Cromer, where _ the Swedish Con-
sulate will probably find its official roof-tree
likewise. Mrs. Von Goes was Miss Stella
Terry. Mrs. Muller is a sister. Another
change of tenants in the above building will
occur when Mr. 11. Tallermann, a genial city
personality, takes wing from his snug quar-
ters in a few weeks j by P. and O. Mr. P.
Mitchell will step in and fill his vacant
chair pro, tern.
Mrs. Julius Goldschmidt, of Holbrook,
Edgecliff, has been hostess for a few weeks to
Miss Oppenheimer, who leaves for her native
London by the Osterley,. after a long spell
of holiday-making in India. She is the
daughter of a departed city magnate—a
naturalised German, knighted by Queen Vic.
in the long ago, and the first foreigner so
honored. Mr. and Mrs. Goldschmidt motored
their guest and a party to Bulli on Sunday.
It was a gorgeous day for sight-seeing, and
everything came up to expectations, the 16
bays being distinctly visible from the Look-
outs
Shoplifting is a topic about which there
has been much clacking of tongues. “Sales”
generally leave this aftermath of gossip, for
all the pickings to be made in that. way
seem, according to the gossipers, to occur at
the half-yearly frenzied bargain bursts. Doc-
tors tell us gravely that kleptomania is a
real disease. One medical man was relating
a tale of himself recently. He said he
walked out of his tobacconist’s, and found,
when half-way down the street, that he had
in his hand a valuable meerschaum pipe. He
stepped back and explained his action, as
due to absence of mind. But the affable shop-
man merely smiled and showed that he had
entered up the item in the doctor’s little bill.
An opulent-looking local dame had the
watch-acquiring habit in rather strenuous
form. It didn’t matter. The shop people
knew her and billed her regularly for the
amounts. She paid them. Long and
earnest attention to these and similar tales
has led me to resolve always to do my shop-
lifting where I am not known, and can get
away with the goods unobserved. Or, if by
any chance I fail in my endeavor, I wifi
serve my sentence under the name of Amelia
Smith.
Yours affectionately,
CLEO

THE. PYJAMA MAN,
by RALPH STOCK.
Author of “The Recipe for Rubber,” etc.
This is a smart story, written by "an author who is rapidly making his way into the front ranks
of our most popular authors.
“The Pyjama Man” is a case of “True love never did run smooth.” Wo have, however, no
hesitation in saying- that the book is bound to be a record seller. It will appeal to all readers of good,
wholesome fiction, and, as the ending is a happy one, the volume, when read, will be put down with
regret that it is finished.
“A Curate in Bohemia,”
By NORMAN LINDSAY.
Price, 11- ; Post Free, 1/1.
As Australia’s foremost Black and White Artist, Norman Lindsay and his work are well known
and highly appreciated, but no one ever dreamt of accusing the artist of being an author. Neverthe-
less the fact remains, and when we say that the work of the author is on a par with that of the
artist, our readers will know what to expect. “The Curate in Bohemia” fairly bristles with bright
things, and the illustrations alone are well worth the money. That so much genuine humor can be
got out ot the adventures of the luckless curate speaks volumes for the ability of the artist-author
who has so suddenly leaped into the literary limelight.
The Golden Kangaroo, By Ambrose pratt.
(Author of “ Three Years with Thunderbolt,” “ The Outlaws of Weddin Range,” etc., etc.)
Price, 1/-; Post Free, 1/1.
The Golden Kangaroo was reported to be one of the best paying propositions the Australian
mining world had ever known. Its directors were pillars of probity who would never dream of
issuing false reports or of salting samples. But the hero of this tale had his doubts and started in
to expose the fakers. He abducts the chairman’s daughter, with whom he goes through many
strange adventures; he works in the mine until he unravels the plot to rig the market; brings the
designing directors to book ; saves the shareholders ; and marries the aforesaid daughter.
Altogether this is a fascinating story well worthy of the attention of readers who enjoy thrilling
situations described in tense, graphic language.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, March 9, 1914.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The vice-regal Stanleys courted a whole-
sale newspaper interview by inviting the
women press representatives to tea at State
Government House-—something unique in the
function line. Victor Hood and Help Wilson
captured the guests in the hall and guided
them to a carefully-arranged circle of lounge
chairs, where they sat and captured any copy
that came their way, while her Ex. prattled
artlessly from the depths of a comfortable
chair in the centre. Her husband, wearing
a rough tweed suit and a look of abject
terror, had obviously been ordered home to
tea on pain of death. He joined the circle
with his ears laid back, and explained that
he had rushed through a meeting of the
Zoological people in order to arrive in
time to be scared horribly. He also confided
that the epaulettes of his new uniform were
frightfully heavy, On the day of his landing
the gold-loaded millinery came fresh out of
its tissue paper wrappings ; he had only worn
it in its chaotic state at the tailor’s. (Ima-
gine a Woman not having a full dress re-
hearsal and try on!) The Stanley lady is
the chippiest little woman, with a good figure
in miniature and a smart taste, in dress.
She Is now busy putting her house in order,
and his Ex. is helping like a good, suburban
husband; also,. like a good suburbanite, he
hiohned abotit fourteen packing-cases he had
to open and a load . of pictures that had to
be hung. His wife here interjected that she
had some ‘‘real” (hand-painted?) pictures,
and would feel really homey when she had
them suspended. Affairs of State and
bazaars are mere bothersome interruptions
during this early settling-down stage.
Amongst other things, the new baker and
butcher and milk-o have to be sorted out
satisfactorily. (I saw the cart of one laun-
dry roll up to the back entrance while I
was on the premises.) Her Ex. loves garden-
ing, and is dying to have a yarn with the
curator of the Botanical, and to exchange
cuttings over the fence. She said that, when
she had a party, she would ignore custom and
not have a marquee on the terrace lawn. If
she can’t build a big entertaining room,
she’ll have an awning all round .the house.
She is keen to entertain, and is a well-drilled
hostess. During the little spree Victor Hood
took photographs with some new sort of
camera, and Help Wilson carried in the
teacups like one who had beeen brought up
specially to attend to such things. He is the
nice kind of good-looking young Englishman
who saves India by playing polo four days a
week and practising it the other three.
The officers of the Australia asked a crowd
of friends to tea and a daylight dance on
deck, one day last week. When the guests
reached the Port Melbourne Town Pier,
they found Hobson’s Bay in a most
irritable mood; there were livid, purple
streaks on its green face, and it
was # throwing itself into the air and
foaming at the mouth. The Australia, an-
chored off the Gellibrand Light, three long
miles out, was just a. smoky grey mass half
hidden in cloud and mist. “Not good enough,”
muttered battalions of the Best Dressed,
peering from the depths of their motors, and
straightway ordered the chaffeurs to drive
home. Some party-lovers who were not
game to face the sea consoled themselves
coldly by inspecting some of the minor war-
machines tied close in to the Pier. The
Melbourne and two of the destroyers were
boarded by batches of overdressed women
who asked the usual questions and were
answered as politely as possible. Meanwhile,
small launches which had been sent for the
deserving Australia visitors, turned their
bows seaward and went butting out through
the seas to their distant grav mother. The
old Lady Loch, now a dowager of the deep,
came to the rescue of those who were not
completely routed and carried them out to the
battle cruiser. Flimsy gathered skirts bal-
looned in the wind and the limb of the split-
skirted damsel had its hour of publicity.
One cold pink sash dangled dejectedly on a
limp white muslin dress. (There are still
foolish folk who think a reception at sea is
just the same as a windless land function
and calls for frail party frocks.) The brave
souls who finally got there report the
presence of bunting, a band, tea, cake, ices
and lots of nice young men of the sea to talk
to and flirt with. The Lady Loch, having
taken its people out, did not trouble to
return for many blissful hours, during which
the sea-maidens had the deuce of a time.
A Parliamentarian who is careful of his
numerous bawbees recently got married. But
there was no unnecessary expense aboot it,
ye ken. The Federal Government keeps a
cab on hand which the travelling members
are free to use for their luggage. The bride-
groom, with the natural exuberance of the
wedding morning, commandeered this Fed-
eral cab, sent it out to his bachelor boarding-
house, and had all his goods and chattels
carted in to the honeymoon train free of
charge. You can’t be too careful when you
are taking a wife. The more money you
save the moi’e there will be available when
she wants a new hat. Man, hats are verra
expensive things! Some of yon cost as
much as twa shulluns!
The Burnham-Niall wedding, which went
through without unseemly interruptions on
March 2, is now ancient history. The pair
will reappear at the Guy Madden-Dorrie
McEvoy proceedings on March 10. I was
at first under the impression that G.-G.
Denman was at the show in person; but
various clamorous friends have assured me
that his dame only attended to watch young
Judith do her little part.
Flemington’s Steeplechase, on Saturday
last, finished the local galloping, and the
people who make a duty of racegoing are off
to Sydney for the next session there. The
north wind that blew in the morning seemed
to promise a disagreeable day; and when the
desired cool breeze sprang up, it wafted all
the manufacturing smells of Footscray to the
lawn and grandstand. Consequently it wasn’t
enjoyed as much as it would have been had
it taken a different route. G.-G. Denman
and all his minions rolled up in a straw-
hatted crowd and started their devotions
with enthusiasm. The Denman lady, who
had been beaten at tennis, showed her sports-
manship by neglecting the racing and staying
to watch the final leaps on the courts. The
Stanley dame was on hand, but showed only
her pretty pointed chin beneath a hat with a
rose on it. Chamberlain Nevill and Captain
Gale acted as her racing advisers in the vice-
regal crate, and seemed to enjoy the duty.
Fan Dango-Mackay wore her hair very red
and her dress very white, and spoke glowingly
of Radnor, the family racing machine, which
was winning heaps of money for all hands.
Mrs. Currie, with a feather shooting from
above her ear, fiaraded with a brochie-
swathed woman who patiently towed a train
up and down the lawn all day. Another
woman was wrapped to the eyes in enormous
furs, and fluttered about fanning herself.
One prominent racegoer agitated part of the
stand by having a fight with another man.
“It’s only T — punching a ‘gun,’ ” explained
the casual males to the excited and curious
women folk. Mrs. Falkiner wore some
clothes that were light and a remarkable
upright feather that cast no noticeable
shadow. The Baillieus beamed blissfully;
they have had some good wins lately. Mrs.
Miller wore a gown constructed of blue and
gold wallpaper or something very like it.
Mrs. Staughton mixed ermine, roses and
chiffon into a pretty costume. Shylie Blue
(now Mrs. Rymer) wore a blue dress to
match her eyes. The Austins and Manifolds
were present in force. Parasols, with
handles so long that they had the appearance
of miniature palm trees and cast no shadow
on the holder’s face, were numerous. I have
seen nothing else quite so useless this season.
The Russell Clarkes have put the holland
covers on the Rupertswood furniture again
and are off to fill in the time between big
race meetings with a spell of foreign wan-
dering. Their excuse for this trip is the
chaperoning of Ivy, who has an appoint-
ment at the altar on the other side of the
world.
Returned Tasmanian holiday-makers re-
port that the new Flyspeck Excellency (I
forget his name for the minute), wears a
fresh orange-colored flower in his button-
hole every day. But what will he do when
marigolds go out? And what will the holi-
day-makers do when they haven’t immensely
important things like this to observe?
The Denman lady bounded through the
tennis tournament in the nicest flannel suit
you ever saw, but all to no purpose. The
Stanley lady looked on admiringly, and,
no doubt, she, too, will be playing later
on. The fine tennis court at State Govern-
ment House made her coo with delight, for
both she and his Ex. are keen on the game.
From a snobbish point of view, the Aus-
tralian Cup was “placed” immediately by
the fact that the vice-regal men put black
cylinders on their heads and let their coat-
tails down to their heels. The Best People
paraded in the gay rags they had aired the
previous day at the Burnham-Niall wedding,
and a crowd of squatter-women barbarously
threatened even newer dresses for the Mad-
den-McEvoy hitching. Ruby Madden-Osborne,
who has returned from foreign parts to see
brother Guy altared, promenaded the lawn in
a black costume. Admiral Patey marched with
the Government House detachment, and
officers of the fleet swarmed where the big-
gest bookies howl, while bluejackets rushed
hill and flat. Amongst the smartest dressers
was Mrs. Falkiner, who put a thin layer of
black ninon between herself and a cool
breeze. Cedric, the Ottawa Campbell’s son
and heir, conducted his English bride out
to see famous Flemington, and cousin Mrs.
Glenloth Peter was gowned amazingly in
fur-woven cloth drooping off an embroidered
transparency.
The Residential Country Club of Victoria
is up in arms against the allegation that
G.-G. Denman complained of the hardness
of the “Gisborne Golf Links” because he had
damaged his sticks thereon. The only “Gis-
borne’’ links belong to the R.C.C. aforesaid,
and his Ex. has not played on them since
April of last year, when he thought them
“ripping,” or a word to that effect. The
hard ground, which lately called forth the
vice-regal anathema, must be one of the
several Macedon places where goffers put in
time.
Last Monday evening (9th) there was a
gathering of the very Best and Most Intel-
lectual in the Old Council Chamber at the
Town Hall to discuss the possibility of
establishing a Shakespeare Memorial
Theatre in our midst by way of celebrating
the bard’s 300th birthday. The Denman
Excellency took the chair, with his Lady to
support him, also the local vice-regals were
invited to be present. Regarded as a whole
the meeting was a great compliment to
Shakespeare. If he doesn’t get a theatre
out of it he will doubtless get a statue, or a
tablet or something.
The Stanley lady is not parading her
young family in public. The Fuller dame
and Clara Butt-Rumford worked the adoring
mother stunt to death, and her Ex. is wise
to keep the children in the nursery. The
Best People are too absorbed in their hats
and rags, anyhow.
The widow Wrixon and her two boys
have wandered off by the same mailboat
as the Mount Gambier Clarkes. A Wrixon
youth and a very young Clarke girleen have
been playing about together, and no doubt
they will not be parted when at sea.
Mrs. Flour Mills Kimpton has just ac-
quired a son. The infant, which has
the honor of calling artist Jimmy Macdonald
“uncle,” is causing considerable i-ejoicing in
the family circle. Grandfather lawyer
Macdonald is cheering as loudly as anyone
and ringing the dinner bell on tlie verandah.
Miss Bailey, matron at Dr. O’Hara’s pri-
vate hospital, is engaged to Commander
Stephenson, one of the brassbound chiefs of
our little navy.
Rumor alleges that a volatile Society girl,
when asked by her fond parents if she had
got married surreptitiously, pitched her best
chiffons into a trunk and cleared out, slam-
ming the front door violently. Later on she
unpacked in the house of a sympatlietic rela-
tive.
The Tony Horderns walked right off the
English boat into the limelight. They lin-
gered long enough on their way to Sydney
to see the Australian Cup run at Fleming-
ton. Mrs. Tony’s tan ninon and tawny
fur made an exquisite dress-picture. The
blissfully wealthy pair have brought out a
new motor, which will astonish Sydney about
Easter time. They have the precious infant
with them; but it is almost impossible to
see it, so long are the nurse’s cap-tails. Mrs.
Sam Hordern is with the party, and there is
said to be a biplane following, though I am
perfectly sure neither Mrs. Sam nor the
baby will use it.
The St. John’s Ambulance Association
gave a party—but the guests weren’t ban-
daged, and there wasn’t any chloroform on
the table. The place is rather like a war-
ship or a fire station. There is an atmo-
sphere of readiness and efficiency and all
those sort of things, so that the confiding
stranger feels quite comfortable about the
risks of the city streets. The good Samaritans
are proud of their four cars, which are hung
lightly on their springs and hurry away with
their prey, as if they were burdened only
with thistledown. Linen coats and caps for
their drivers hang behind glass where flies
and dust cannot rest on them, and their
clean appearance would make a laundress
weep for envy, laundresses being people who
like everything just dirty enough to justify
them in washing it on the usual terms. The
drivers themselves have bedrooms in the
building, comfortable beds and specially de-
signed wardrobes that would make a baboon
keep tidy—though I don’t mean to insinu-
ate that the drivers are as bad as all that.
Secretary Greenwood, who has the neatest
office I have ever seen, designed these fittings
himself, without outside aid or interference.
He has a great affection for his library of
bandages, which comprises about 600 kinds,
and he has a name for each. President
Springthorpe (irreverently called “Springy”
when he isn’t in the vicinity) murmured the
startling fact that the cars do about four
times the waist measurement of the earth in
answering a year’s calls for help. Last year
the Association expended £3OOO. The muni-
cipalities assist a little, but the Government
has not yet acquired the habit, which seems
a pity when you hear that 1843 cases were
attended to free of charge during last work-
ing year. There is a new car now on the
way which will rush more sufferers towards
skilled aid. The Association has been in
existence since 1883. It commenced in a
modest way by teaching first aid and nursing.
The late Janet Mrs. Clarke was its first
president and generous patroness, and
its present-day council of eight includes two
women —Mrs. McKinley and the girl who
was Nancy Grice but is now Mrs. Somebody-
or-other.
Tenor Hal Cohen Colonna, who went from
the Block to Coven t Garden, has become a
mere married man and is very excited about
it. He cabled the staggering news to his
relatives in Bendigo and Tasmania, and gave
a sort of outline. The bride is clever and
decorative, has a lot of money, hails from
France, and spent the honeymoon with her
fond cablegrammer in Italy. The family
is now _ waiting for further particulars.
Colonna is booked to appear in Italy as the
tenor in “Louise” and “Boheme.”
The Repertory Company is making a new
move, and has booked the Theatre Royal for
Saturday matinees during the 1914 season.
The first happens gloriously on March 21,
and others follow on June 6. August 22 and
November 7. This undoubtedly is the most
forward move McMahon has made. Satur-
day “mats” at the Royal will get a name for
intellectuality, and no person of bulged fore-
head will dare to miss them. Somebody
should propose a Royal Society of Saturday
Matineers, with the Stanlev Excellency for
president.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The public welcome to Dr. Mawson came off in the
Town Hall on Tuesday before an immense audience —
the Referee being Mayor Simpson. The bleacher, or
dress-circle seats, were reserved for ladies, and
amongst the science fans to be observed in different
parts of the house were the knights E. T. Smith
and Charles Goode, the Simpson Newlands, the Pen-
dletons, the Eustace Grundys, who are just back
from a trip to Queensland, Dr. and Mrs. C. Todd,
Mrs. Mac Diarmid, Mrs Halcomb, and, of course,
the Delprats; the wives of the State Ministers, and
about a ton and a half of aldermen.
Two Tango Teas have already occurred, and more
are threatened. They both drew packed houses, and
scandalised murmurs of “Shocking!” “Did you
ever?” “There now!” and so forth. I don’t know
whether it is the free provender or the unique oppor-
tunity that this saintly city is given of being shocked
at the spectacle of a number of young women in their
corsets, but the fact remains that the new Mclntosh
venture has caught on. The parsons have started
going in disguise to see if it is really as naughty
as it is painted, and when that happens, my dear,
you know, as a maiden of the world yourself, that
the success of a show is assured.
On Thursday Miss Lilia Hornabrook left for Sydney,
where she will presently board the Wiltshire en
route for England. Her sister joins her as she
passes through here. The Stephen Rallis and their
three small sons go by the same boat.
The engagement is announced of Kathleen, fourth
of the Richard Butler daughters, to Mr. H. M. Muir-
head. This will make for economy in relations-in-
law as a Muirhead-Butlcr wedding occurred about a
year ago, when the “contracting parties” were the
brother and sister of the hero and heroine of this
par. Far be it from a confirmed romantic like
myself, however, to suggest that this is the sole ex-
planation of the affair.
Miss Nora Kyffin Thomas, who plays the violin
better than most people, and has been putting in
some time in Germany acquiring extra musical lore,
returned to the land of her birth by the Friedrich
der Grosse on Saturday.
On Wednesday an advertisement announced that
“an anonymous donor” had placed nearly £4OOO in
the hands of Mr. A. Y. Harvey for distribution
amongst certain charities, the secretaries of which
were requested to call and collect their cheques.
They did so, with extreme promptitude, and by five
o’clock most of the cash had been handed over. It
will be a couple of weeks, probably, before the iden-
tity of the anonymous donor is established publicly.
The death of Mrs. George Riddoch, in Melbourne,
came as a shock to Adelaide. She was the wife of
Mr. Riddoch, M.L.C., whose place, Koorine, is one
of the jewels of the south-east.
High-Commisioner Reid passed through in the
Otranto on Friday. He has been recuperating in a
private hospital, and, as a result, the frail appear-
ance which he developed in the South-East has left
him.
The Spicer-Love wedding on Saturday was quiet to
the verge of furtiveness. No outsiders ; no wassail;
no wild hilarious matrimonial jokes; no heaving of
old boots—nothing, in brief, but a service at St.
John’s Church and a meal at Waverley, South Terrace,
which is inhabited by the bride’s sister, Mrs. T. K.
Bowman.
The Bulletin has one admirer, anyhow. Governor-
General Denman classed it to the University audience
which greeted Mawson as among those things which
make life worth while.- However, he rather let the
act down, as they say on the stage, bv mentioning
George Reid’s speeches as another blessing that the
intrepid explorer would necessarily find it hard to
forego. Still another Australian boon was bracketed
with The Bulletin and Reid, viz., race-meetings,
The G.-G. is a profound appreciator of the way in
which the racing game is played in Australia.
Prof. Masson, who went to Adelaide for the Maw-
son welcome, described himself with something that
was either Gallic courtesy or Chinese self-abasement,
as an insect “enshrined in the clear, transparent,
golden amber of the other’s fame.” Neat, wasn’t it?
Other speakers were the Governor-General, Premier
Peake, who seemed ill at ease, and Groom
of the Customs, the orator of the occasion, whose
oratorical determination to pump enthusiasm out of
his audience is just a little too marked. Captain
Davis, of the Aurora, hailed his audience as if it
were a topmast-hand in a gale, and caused immense
enthusiasm, as loud-voiced hailers invariably do.
“Anvbody can die,” he roared “you just crawl into
your sleeping-bag, and throw in your hand” (which
U.S. metaphor the papers translated into “give
up the struggle”). “Our man went on living —for a
month— stabved— and ALONE!” This final' hail or
howl brought down the house. So did, at a Town
Hall welcome, Madigan, the Rhodes scholar. Mawson
himself is a dreadful speaker. By the way, the tall,
handsome girl who is to wed him shortly, and who
sat in the front row throughout his ordeal, looked
unutterable things when he hinted at a possibility
of his going back to the frozen regions.
Neil Hepper, dead at 30 in a South Australian hos-
pital, might have been one of the brightest comedians
on the professional stage if his lungs had only been
sound. He was so brilliant an amateur while in the
Union Bank in Adelaide, six or seven years back, that
he was about to turn pro., but the doctors sent him
out-back on to a cattle-station instead, and the in-
evitable end was delayed for a time, only.
The Mount Lofty Flower Show was opened on
Saturday by Mrs. Arthur Waterhouse. The president,
Dr. E. C. Stirling, would have done it, but he is
health-hunting in Tasmania. In other respects, it
was like most other flower shows, so as I detest
the practice of dilating upon the obvious, I will
hereby bid thee a fond farewell, till this day week.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.

ABIRIGIN-
ALITIES
“Tiaki” : All the evidence procurable as to
character and otherwise was* not adduced by “Ding-
bat” in the Maoriland tutu case (B. 15/1/’l4). Tutu,
or tupakihi (Coriaria ruscifolia ) is also valuable in
that the leaves, if chewed, are a sure carminative in
cases of dysentery, etc. Another use is in the case
of bruised limbs or wounds: cut up a quantity of
leaves and smaller branches, boil them and bathe
the affected parts in the lotion. Wounds are poul-
ticed with the leaves and soon heal up. Before the
Workers’ Insurance Act came into force I was toiling
at a sawmill and had the misfortune to “bog” or
hurst the front of my shin bone. Inflammation set
in, and I was shipped off (at my own expense) to
thje doctor, where I was supplied with a lotion
(also at my own expense) which seemed to help the
inflammation along wonderfully. Eru Nehua made
me up a decoction of the pounded stuff, and in two
days I was back again to my “donkey work.” A
good wine is also derived from the berries. Gorging
on rangiora (Bru.chyglottis rangiora ) has the same
effects as a tutu feed on animals. Methods of rcsto-
r tion are (1) to run the animals around until they
“sweat it off”; (2) smoke their heads until they
“cough it up” ; (3) and (this is Henare’s own patent)
give the patient a liberal decoction of boiled flax-
root and salt. An empty horse let loose on rangiora
generally performs some razzle-dazzle stunts that
would earn him three months if an equine John Hop
were around. Also the fool-bee gathers honey from
the flower, which has been the cause of many an
inquest. The smell of the flowers is like unto a
heavenly brewery, and many a thirsty bushman
doesn’t know how parched he is until he gets a
whiff of the rangiora flower.
“L.S.”: A Chinaman who had wealthy
relath'o3 in Melbourne died lately at Bullville
(Vic.), and Job Smithers, undertaker, was in-
structed to coffin and entrain the remains. He fixed
up the departed in his best style, placed the coffin
in the old hearse, and made for the station to catch
the 2.30 train. But his horse was slow, and while
yet he was afar off the train steamed in. Job
whipped up his steed, and the hearse clattered over
the stones at a great pace, to the joy of the young
and the horror of the old. The ancient neddy was
not equal to the task, however, and the train puffed
out as the hurried funeral 'reached the station gates.
Next train was at G. 30. Job made for the nearest
pub, and, leaving the hearse outside, drowned his
sorrows in the longest glass he could buy for six-
pence. Constable Johns happened along, and peeped
inside the hearse. Then he sought Job within the bar,
and informed him that he must move on, and keep
moving. Job drove slowly round the one-horse town
about 50 times; then, having tired of this circus
act and his horse being practically dead, he drew
up in the station yard and deposited the coffin on
two cream-cans in a small shed sacred to local dairy-
men. lie then took the hearse home. When he
returned he was met by a maniac in the uniform of
a stationmaster, who frenziedly howled for the re-
moval of “that Chow’’ from_ the cream temple.
Job, whose patience had by this time run low, stood
up to his man, loudly protesting that the defunct
Celestial was “all right.” But the stationmaster still
raved and talked of gaol, and the best Job could do
was to lug his charge out of the shed and hide it
behind some timber. Then he had some more drinks
and forgot his troubles, and whether the deceased is
still behind the timber, or whether ho has moved
on or been taken away, Job knoweth not. And he
is too much terrified to inquire. In fact, he is look-
ing up the papers to find out the cost of a passage
to America.

“X.P.D.”: In Papua—where there are
kangaroos that climb trees and woolly-haired Jews
with the eyes of Chinamen—a patent composite rep-
tile splits the differences between the turtle and the
tortoise. This tortle, or turtoise, knocks about in
the Fly River. While sea-turtles have paddles to
swim with, their fresh-water relations, the tortoises,
are fitted with webbed feet and claws. But the
latest style of animal is a fresh-water turtle, having
paddles complete, plus claws on two toes and minus
the horny plates that tortoises generally wear. I
wouldn’t like to eat a thing like that, but there’s
a less eccentric member of the family in Papua. It
is just about identical with the Atlantic turtle, which
manufactures the famous soup. Also, the hawksbill
of Papuan coasts yields tortoiseshell (or turtle-shell)
as good as any in the world. It is worth a sovereign
a pound, or was when I lived in Papua; but few
people chase the animal for its roof.
DANCING SHIPS.
“I see you call your new ship the Tango Maru.
How funny!”
“Oh, yes, Miss. And by-and-bye we’ll bring
out the Bunny hug Maru; and it’s very
like, Honorable Miss, Australia will do
the Turkey Trot, eh?”
“Jobber”: I’m nominating • this (with £1
to back it) for the mean woman competition. Ham-
fat (that’s not his name, but it’s good enough for the
fellow) had four men on piecework cutting grass
for seed at so touch an acre. He hated to have to
pay, and went over each toiler’s land two or three
times with the tape at the conclusion of the job in
case he should rob himself. After calculations that
lasted the whole of one' night, he paid over the
cheques, and the men departed. Then Mrs. Hamfat
brightened things up by explaining how she’d cut a
good length out of the middle of the tape, and
joined the ends so carefully that no honest man would
know the difference.
HOW IT HAPPENED.
PASING FRIEND: “ Hallo! ’Ow’d Bill manage ter do that to ’is face?”
PASSING DRUNK: “Well, 'er fac' ’tis, we been havin’ a few drinks, an’ Bill (hic,
stepped on the end o' George-street, an’ it flew up an’ ’it ’im.”
“Ginger”: I was working in a survey
camp about 15 miles east of Mount Ida (W.A.), away
back in ’94, when a party of about a hundred Darlot
blacks arrived. About sunset they withdrew to a
sandhill a few chains distant from our camp, and the
gins and dogs began scratching at the sand like rab-
bits. In about an hour they made an excavation a
chain long and three feet deep. Piles of dry saltbush
was then hurled in and burned. When the fire had
died down the bucks tested the ashes with their feet
to see if there were any live embers left. The test
proving satisfactory, men, women, children and dogs
huddled into the hole and stretched themselves out in
the most promiscuous fashion. In the chilly morning
they awoke dusty and dirty, but as spry as if they
had fared on feathers and spring mattresses. It is
only in the cold season Binghi of W.A. goes' to the
trouble of preparing a bed. On other occasions he
regards a doss beside a saltbush as the very thing
the doctor ordered.

“Machete”: “Norbell’s” pleasant story of
that Westralian hanging (B. 29/l/’l4) recalls the
suspension of Ambushi, village constable of the
Kumusi River, in Papua. Ambushi was a man of
parts. Owing to the cheerful manner in which he
used to aid the miners and others in the long drag
up the rushing Kumusi to Bogi, then the only route
to the Yodda goldfield, his fame became great, and
he and his villagers reaped a harvest in trade
tobacco. He was convicted of numerous secret
forays and a few murders, including those of indented
carriers; also he was seriously implicated in the
butchery of miner King and his mate. After that.
“Btishi” became unpopular, and it was decided to
hang him. Then the trouble began. The principal
hangman of the good old days had been an 'Bffi'cial
of the Government steamboat Merrie England.' He
was. lost and fled and gone, and no one remained
who remembered his methods. The wretched A.R.M.
of the district was nearly off his head. lie was
deputy sheriff, and his duty, failing a substitute,
was to hang his old acquaintance, Ambushi. Though
no volunteers came forward among the white miners
and traders, there was plenty of advice. One genius
who had been on the Klondyke told how the N.W.
Mounted Police had “worked the oracle.” They
stood the condemned man on the -ground, and the
rope was led over a beam 10ft. above him. At the
end of the rope, allowing some slack, a 2001 b. bag
of flour was tied and balanced on i the beam. When
the word was given the flourbag was pushed off the
beam on the opposite side of the victim, “and you
never saw a cleaner job.” In the end a Kiwai
sergeant from the Merrie England settled the diffi-
culty. With all his world and its wife to watch,
“Bushi” was pulled up to a convenient tree-branch
by a rope looped under his armpits. The police
sergeant who sat on the branch adjusted a shorter
rope, with a running noose, about the patient’s neck.
Then he spat on his hands, pulled a tomahawk out
of his belt, and with one cut severed the first rope.
Nothing could have been more satisfactory and
definite. At a subsequent suspension ceremony the
sergeant officiated again with the same gratification
to all parties. On that occasion a clergyman was
present, and, before the ceremony, the R.M. took the
sergeant aside and warned him to observe greater
decorum, and “not to spit on his hands this
time.” He didn’t; and everything, including the
patient, went off smoothly.
“Oimai” : “Te Babarantiko’s” omnivorous
Central Pacific nigs (B. 12/2/’l4) have their counter-
parts in Papua. Coming up the N.E. coast once in
a whaleboat, writer landed at Mitre Rock and
dynamited a boatload of fish. While this was being
done, a seven-foot shark was caught. That night,
on Mambare Beach, six native police and a dozen
carriers, with a casual friend or two, cleaned up
the lot. Next evening, as we were going up the
Mamba River, just before we camped, a crocodile,
between eight and nine feet long, was shot. The
police and the carriers got the assistance of a few
villagers, and the croc, faded out, too. A strong
fresh prevented us reaching the station next evening,
so the poor devils had to do a perish on a 501 b. bag
of rice.
THE PERFECT LADY.
INEBRIATED LADY: “ Offisher, you mush (hie)
not come in. I have to pufform my
toilet.”
“Pegasus”: Re “Overseer’s” par. about
poisoning fish by Fijians (B. 25/12/'l3). On the
leeward side of the island of Taviuni the familiar
coral reef is absent. The coast is rock-bound, very
rough and irregular, and the depth of water at the
coastline varies from two to 40 fathoms. The method
adopted by the Fijian on the leeward side to secure
a fish breakfast is to pound a vine, not the leaves,
as “Overseer” mistakes. After pounding it to a
pulp the mush is tied up in leaves, which the
women, diving down, place under the ledges of
rocks. Having broken open the parcels, the women
return to the surface and indulge in a sunbath on
the rocks for some lOmin. Thereabouts the drunken
and blithered fish begin to appear on the surface, and
are easily caught.

SONG OF THE AXEMAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Unto you the steady billet and the daily jug of beer,
But the very thought of wages sends a shiver down
my spine.
You can have the stylish clobber that the city chap
holds dear;
The cabbage-tree and dungarees, and blucher boots
be mine.
I'm a Murrumbidgee camper, who can knock out beef
and damper
Where the great gum-trees grow taller than the lofty
fact’ry stacks,
And the Boss may go to blazes, and get bushed within
its mazes,
For the climate's bad for Bosses where the Axeman
grips his axe.
When the blade aloft is gleaming,
And the chips begin to fly,
And the purple gum comes streaming
As the glad sun mounts the sky,
Do you hear the lyrebird singing
By the distant billabong?
Mimicking the axe’s ringing?
Flinging back the Axeman’s song?
With my Kelly's hick’ry handle polished like a bil-
liard cue,
Charred and smoothed and dressed with em’ry, till
it scintillates like glass—
With a razor-edge on Douglas that will split a hair
in two ;
It’s a game of beer and skittles logging off upon the
grass.
If your timber you can pick it, five-foot’s just like
playing cricket,
If your tools are like a tradesman's, splitting posts
is just the same.
If the Axeman don’t wax wealthy he can keep the
gin-case healthy ;
lie can hold the little humpy which no Overlord may
claim.
When the Axe is blithely ringing
In the timber-getters’ camp,
When he hears the crosscut singing
It’s as music to the tramp.
And he greets the sounds of yakker
As the squatter greets the rains,
For it’s grub and grog and ’bacca
To the Arab of the plains.
When the boat comes up in August she’ll be loaded
fore and aft
With a hundred ton of five-foot and a thousand eight-
by-fours.
When the last stick leaves the woodpile I will jump
aboard the craft
With a light “So-long” to Douglas and the brace
of crosscut saws.
And I’ll see the reedbeds quiver as we’re plunging
down the river
On the Storm Bird to Echuca, and the passenger to
Hay.
There will be a hearty' greeting when the Bush and
Town gets meeting,
For the Hay folk love the Axeman, as a man who
pays his way.
Yes, I love the axe's ringing,
And I love the Bush’s call ;
And I love the measured swinging
Of the steady muffled maul.
While the crosscut she’s a pearlie,
She can make the sawdust hum
When the grain is tough and curly,
And she's ripping through a gum.

“Pick” : “Marloo” (B. 12/2/’l4) seems to
think the N. S. Wales coastal dairyman is not con-
cerned about the improvements of his herd. “Mar-
loo s wrong. The cow cocky may not worry about
small things like the education of his offspring or
the betterment of his employees’ living conditions;
but he’s wide-awake enough when it’s a matter of
getting the best results out of his female joss. At
Bodalla (South Coast) the herds are worked abso-
lutely for results. At each dairy on the estate the
net yield from each herd is carefully tabled for
purposes of comparison at the end of every month.
A separate compilation shows individual results —the
quantity and butter-fat test figures are kept for each
cow, with other data showing how long the lady has
been in milk, etc., etc. And Bodalla’s lead in
scientific dairying is being followed at almost every
big cow-run along the Coast. The smaller men, cer-
tainly, do not keep clerks to prepare the returns, but
among them the rule is that a cow must turn in a
minimum of £1 per month. If she fails, her halo
is torn off her, and out she goes to the butcher’s cask.

_ “McNorth” from Farthest Up:—The
Binghis who were recently convicted of the murder
of one Campbell, a bBche-de-mer fisher in the N.T.,
have, it seems, gained much sympathy from the un-
initiated in the South because it was stated that
Campbell was “rough on the blacks.” Rubbish!
The man who is “rough on the blacks” is seldom, if
ever, molested nowadays. It’s the weakling who
gives Binghi anything and everything he asks for—
whether with the idea of inducing him to work, or
with hopes of instilling some semblance of gratitude
in the nigger’s heart—who is “done in.” The niggers
become so accustomed to getting things for nothing
that when the foolish white man’s larder is empty,
or he goes broke, or suddenly acquires sense, and so
refuses to accede to the old demands, Black Brother
becomes annoyed, and clubs or spears his benefactor.
Ihen the people who have not even a superficial
knowledge of the circumstances arise, and witli a
loud voice blame the white man for being the
aggressor. This flabby sympathy for the “pore
black,” who is really a treacherous parasite, is dis-
couraging to the lone white men who are trying
to do something with the country Binghi has had
since the year dot and done nothing with. It’s to
be hoped the more-or-less spineless Queensland
Administration will carry out its stated intention of
herding the Binghis in settlement stations, thereby
ceeping them under control, and making things a
ttle easier for the pioneers in the Far Away places.

There has been a sort of slump in Sydney
shark-fight reports since a couple of carrion-
catchers publicly alleged that the mad stomach
captured by a pair of proud novices was quite dead
when they (the carrion-catchers) attached it to the
baited hook which the novices were not watching.
(This vile sort of trick was once played on George
Reid while he was asleep, and he has never shark-
fished since.) There was an indignant shout of
denial from the conquerors of the alleged dead; but,
by that time, the subject was no longer worth
printers’ ink and space. Still there was a fresh
flicker of interest lately when a man of Long Bay
(Sydney) netted a mere five-foot tiger shark which,
with an old bayonet buried in its back, made a
spirited attempt to eat the skiff its captor was in.
The sympathy of a meat-stricken populace was with
the famished sea-brute, and its funeral would have
been largely attended if it hadn’t been refused
decent burial.
CLIMAX AND ANTI-CLIMAX.
FIRST W OWSER: “Ah, deak brother, it is our
duty to arise and vigorously denounce
these unseemly fashions.”
SECOND DITTO: “Hush, brother! There goes
my wealthiest parishioner, Miss Par tup. "
SAME OLD FIGHT.
WOWSER: “Ah, Tommy, have you been in another fight?"
T OMMY: “Naw; just had the second round to-day."
“F.Y.7”: Maorilander’s “devil spider”
of the West, which catches ants in a conical pit, is
the ant lion” found in nearly every part of the
world. Any patch of dust about Sydney is pretty
certain to harbor one. Kipling utilised the idea of
the ant lion’s pit, with its unscalable walls of slipping
sand, in that fine yarn “The Strange Ride of Morrow-
by Jukes.”
“Lagani Namo”: At Taurama, even
when there isn’t a whiff of wind, the sea will
boil in tumult. When natives approach this point
in their canoes they shut off talk and
paddle with every ounce of their
power, knowing that vessels innumer-
able have been dashed to pieces in
this Charybdis because they disre-
garded the presence of the Amazonian
spirits which haunt the place. Away
amid the hazy coat-tails of antiquity,
the hill back of Taurama was occu-
pied by a powerful company of
women. Presumably they were re-
cruited by a kidnapping process, for
there were no men, and no Wowser
performed the marriage ceremony. In-
stead of chasing food for themselves,
these Amazons made forays on other
villages. At length they raided a
distant inland people, and were so
pleased with the splendid physique of
the men that, after massacring the
women and infants, they took the
males prisoners to Taurama. Now,
for the first time in their lives, they
married and demanded that their hus-
bands should wash up. Presently in-
stinct kept the women at home, and
they began importuning the men to
do the hunting. But they, thinking
that, if once they began this, it would
henceforth be expected of them, secured
only sufficient food for themselves,
and returned to the village with the
lie that they had been unsuccessful.
Then the women suggested that the
men might do better fishing, so the
canoes were manned and a great bur-
den of fish caught. Again, instead
of hurrying home with it, the party
satisfied their own needs and re-
turned empty-handed. As the fleet
of canoes approached Taurama all the women (1100
of them) congregated on the cliff, but when the
men shouted up that they hadn’t any fish the women
collapsed in travail, and gave birth to 2200 twins.
The cliff was torn asunder in the hurry, and the
general ruin hurtled down the steep upon the
canoes. As the late edition said on the Last Day
of Pompeii, not a soul was left to tell the tale.
That’s all the more reason to tell it now.
Ding Bat”: Wild pigs in Maoriland are
a curse to most folk, but the surveyors, in the King
Country at any rate, derive much benefit from the
untamed porker. The King Country is a network of
bushy hills and deep and seemingly impassable lime-
stone gullies. A surveyor would spend weeks looking
for a good crossing if it were not for the pigs. With
their help he generally manages the job in a day.
It’s like this. He gets on a pig track and follows it
up. If other tracks from time to time join it, he is
sure to come soon to a natural bridge or an easy
crossing over the gulch. These tracks never fail, and
they are so plain and so well graded that it is a
pleasure to walk along them. One often hears the
new-chum remark that it is wonderful how roads,
tracks, etc., all seem to go the best and easiest way
across swamps and the like, and surveyors come in
for a lot of praise that they really don’t deserve.
Ihe road which has the reputation of being the best
graded in the King Country was mapped out by a
surveyor who simply drove in his middle pegs on the
pig track he was following.
* * * *
“Marloo”: Along the coastal districts of
N. S. Wales many farmers are making a good living
on lands which were formerly covered by swamps.
Some of these swamps were drained, others dried up
of their own accord. The soil is like the bogs of
Ireland, composed mainly of decayed vegetable mat-
ter. Settlers on what was the Newrybar Swamp
(North Coast) have found to their sorrow that this
soil further resembles peat in that it burns freely.
A few weeks ago a dairyman there noticed part of
his earth smouldering. The occurrence was treated
as a curiosity and no one had the sense or speed to
extinguish the fire, so it continues to smoulder, and
has travelled over many acres. So far it has reached
a depth of over 2ft., and will probably go deeper
Along the Government drain 70 chains of fencing lie
flat, its foundation gone. The fire can now only be
extinguished by a heavy fall of rain, and that will
probably convert much of the land into swamp-
country again. „
. S ’” : With the ripening of the fruit
of the Moreton Bay fig the hordes of flying foxes
make night hideous with flapping wings and rusty
screechings. To the local gardens and orchards come
the malodorous raiders. At twilight they leave their
camps on the mangrove-covered islands at the river
mouth, and, sweeping up stream, startle the amorous
Brisbane flapper and her bloke with showers of re-
jected fruit from overhead ; while, in his stuffy bun-
galow beneath the figs, the Brisbaneite lams the mos-
quito and curses the rain of hard vegetables on the
eternal galvanised-iron roof.

Eddyson”: Paddy Welsh was behaving
queerly for a seemly “widow-man.” He had taken
up the sheet from his bed, and had gone forth in
the light of the small of the moon, and was trapesing
round the house of Norah Brady, relict, making a
nuisance with his unbecoming noises and the wild
words of him, trampling down the cabbages, too, and
doing great harm to the growing greengroceries
with the great walloping feet he had. It was after
the midnight hours, and the widow’s house was low
in the neck of the hill, with the night-bush standing
up over it, a black line like Croogan’s funeral, and
the birds so still, and the widow and the little
orphan twins long a-bed. Paddy Welsh, himself a
quiet and a decorous man by custom, and one that
lived lonesome on a clump of stone land forninst
the Oldman-road, drew the sheet up over his head,
and went walking the house around, all with him-
self, and the bristling dog in the kennel hard by
making horrible mutterings, with his torments of
hate and his unwillingness to take to the Devil in
the open in a winding-sheet and with the scent of
Hell on him, for Paddy Welsh burnt sulphur a bit
between the noises he made. And “Oooh-oooh, ooo-
ooooh!” said Paddy, just that same, drawing the
sound out, a long, unwelcome, miserable keening,
same as the dead might speak, them being uneasy
of their souls, and never yet free of mortal pains.
And “Oooh-oooh-000-ooooh!” said Paddy Welsh, and
he threw up his hands, shaking the white sheet that
had come from his bed. “Rooin, rooin, room! ”
said he in the thin, weak voice of Phil Brady,
deceased. “Niver a good man to attind to nothin’!”
said Paddy, and he ground the teeth of him loud and
hard, like any ghost might, being angered. “Niver
a sthrong man t’ dig me land over, ’n’ make me
crops, n fend me childther, ’n’ be th’ comfort iv me
poor widdy. Ooooh-oooh-0000-ooooh!” And when
he had walked five times he went home to his still
house, and took to his empty bed, for he had seen
the white face of the widow Norah peeping out
awful from the crack of the blind. After that, Paddy
Welsh went walking five times with the sheet before
the widow Norah came down by his land one noon,
and said she: “Do you be havin’ any ghosts come
to you at all in these parts, Pathrick Welsh?” And
Paddy thought a minute. “Niver a ghost-man that
I have a mind to, savin’ wance, whin Corcoran’s cow
came wid the white sheet iv himself caught off the
line be her horns, ma’am. And are they botherin’
at ye up to the house, maybe?” “I dunno, I dunno
in the laste,” sighed the widow, “not bein’ ’n’ th’
way be knowin’ ghosts be their signs, ’r accustomed
to the ways appertainin’ t’ shpooks ’n’ goblin-ban-
shees. But tis a strange thing in a white dress cut
quare in no shtyle I’m acquaint wid, ’n’ it walks ’n’
walks me house around, wid its complaints, ’n’ its
grumblin’s, ’n’ th’ symptoms iv pains be the stomach
not rightful in a ghost be reason iv a ghost havin’
no stomach by him at all.” “And does he do nothin,’
Mrs. Widdy Brady, t’ indicate th’ why ’n’ wherefore
iv his walkin’ frim his grave, ’n’ him wid seven
solid fut iv clay t’ persuade him down?” “Then yeh
know in yer heart ’tis himself bruck out, ’n’ hauntin’
me cabbages, Pathrick Welsh?” “I have me doubts
n misgivin s, Mrs. Phil. ’Tis most like he wants
yeh t’ marry be a man, strong V sober; to mind,
n make, n mend for yeh ’n’ do be th’ twins like a
true father ’n’ kind.” Mrs. Brady was properly
impressed, and went alone home, and thought by
east and west and north and south, the while Paddy
Welsh came again three times, and walked in his
sheet, making queer and various complaint, passing
where the dog hid far back in his box, stiff with
distrust and mortal fear, but growling in whispers
exceeding vicious. ’Twas the third night Paddy
tripped on a cabbage, and pitched forward, treading
on his sheet, and standing out a moment just a man,
and nothing else at all, with the bad word on his lips.
Paddy’s misfortune it was to be adjacent the kennel
that moment, and the sight sped away all the
terrors of the dog, confirming at once his long-stand-
ing suspicion ; and Tiger came from his kennel to be
even for all the sleep the ghost had cost him, and
the mental toils and the rackings of the spirit it had
put upon him these 15 nights. Never was a ghost
so bitten and bedevilled by a mongrel pup. Next
morning early Mrs. Brady came again to collogue
with Paddy. “ ’Tis still by me night after night,”
said she, “makin’ persuasion, ’n’ cryin’ the like
would break your heart in your body.” “He’ll have
you marry Mrs. Norah,” said Welsh, with great
power of feeling, “and no rest short of it will come
to your pillow, ma’am.” “You do think it true
and earnest, Pathrick Welsh, them bein’ th’ wishes
iv deceased?” “I do, Mrs. Norah; I do think it,
most honest ’n’, be me oath. An’ you’ll not be
forgettin’ me hand’s been offered you in honorable
marriage these three months.” Norah was wiping
her eyes on her apron. “I’ll not be hidin’ from
you, Pathrick Welsh, yiv convinced me well ’n’
certain ’tis th’ wishes iv himself now dead t’ have
me wed again.” “I’m that glad of it, Mrs. Norah,
so I am. ’ “And "tis me beholden juty to honor ’n’
obey me husband, though deep in th’ dark iv his
grave he is ? ’ “ ’Tis so, ma’am. ’Tis righteous ’n’
proper.” “That bein’, Pathrick Welsh, I’ve con-
sinted t’ marry Bart O’Brien, frim Tinlid, come Tues-
day a week.” And Mrs. Brady went away with those
words, leaving Paddy Welsh to commune with him-
self for one whole day.
THE THOUGHTFUL HUSBAND.
[FOR THE BULLEIN.]
A blithe and honest chap was he,
As kind a one as you could meet,
Who in the shop in Swanston-street
Was trying shoes along with me.
He wanted boots that must be strong,
And also cheap. ’Twas plain to see
He wasted nought on vani-tee.
A sample pair they brought along.
These brogues were heavy, thick and wide,
And set up like an iron safe.
The noble soul began to chafe.
“Oh, chase them bloomin’ things!” he cried.
“You’ve got ’em lighter, I suppose?
Them’s cowardly. They’re not the sort.
To my mind, cobber, no one ort
To kick his wife with boots like those.”

Sanatogen Brings New
Health and Nerve Force.
“ I have used Sanatogen with extra-
ordinary benefit. It is to my mind a true
food tonic, feeding the nerves, increasing
the energy, and giving fresh vigour to the
overworked body and mind.”
These words by Sir Gilbert Parker, M.P.,
the well-known author, have a helpful
meaning for you —if you need real help in
one of those crises of life when your health
is giving you anxiety.
They echo a sentiment of gratitude which
is expressed in many different ways in
thousands upon thousands of letters from
men and women who owe to Sanatogen new
strength and vitality.
The Rt. Hon. Sir John Gorst, member of His
Majesty's Privy Council, writes: “Sir John
Gorst wishes to say he has long been acquainted ■»
with the great merits of Sanatogen—has taken
it with excellent results, and when necessary v
will certainly take it again. It was also used
by a daughter of his with great benefit.’’
To you who are run down, nervous or
weak—to you who are less than yourself —
Sanatogen will bring new health. To you
whose nerves have gone wrong, and whose
appetite or sleep or capacity for work are
impaired, Sanatogen comes as a rescuing
sustainer, a revitalising force, a feeder of
nerves and tissues.

By the irreligious EdUtor: —
“Never,” said Lloyd George, the British Govern-
ment Shortage man, speaking of the price at which
the Duke of Sutherland ofix;red the craggy end of
his property to the State, “never has there been
such a case since Ananias and Sapphira. ’ Poor
old Ananias and Sapphira! There is something
mean and dirty and wretched about the way their
bones are incessantly dragged aa-ound by pious and
uncharitable folk and Welsh Methodists anil
Welsh rabbits and the like, it is only recorded that
they told one lie apiece in all theft r lives, and the
mild young man at the d.’apery counter has to tell
several per day if he expects to ido business. At
the worst, the case against the dead Jew and
Jewess was that they sold their pooperty intending
to give the money to the Church, buJt—on second
thoughts, perhaps having suspicions of the Church,
and desiring to have a trifle t or their oE age they
kept something back, and only" made' the Church a
gift of most of the money. As the _ banks put it,
they established an inner reserve. i»ut a bad-tem-
pered Apostle, who had a pretty baol reputation as
a liar himself, and had also cursed; in a public place,
demanded an account of the balitnce, and Ananias
and Sapphira took the easy way oust of the difficulty
by denying that any balance existed. Whereupon
the bad-tempered Apostle, who seemed to be wild
over losing a trifle of money, assun.ied a lofty atti-
tude, and struck the pair dead. It .isn t even le-
corded that he did the square thing .afterwards by
making provision for little Ananias, trie baby, it
there was such a person. If things Had been run
on these lines in 1892 and 1893, half the ibank mana-
gers and building-society managers and land-jobbers
in Australia would have fallen down c ead every
time the balance-sheet came out, and a whole lot of
the tribe would drop dead regularly to-doy. lhe
Church is too often a sour and illogical creature
which gets into a habit of throwing thing); up at
people on insufficient evidence. As an instance, few
even among Scripture readers realise that, for all
Holv Writ says to the contrary, Barabbas was a
g-ood patriot, and a respectable husband and father,
and hadn’t a stain on his character. True he was
called a robber, but “robber” was a common term
among the polite loyalists of the day—the folk who
had afternoon tea with Pilate and whom Herod asked
occasionally to have a drink or a cigar—for a rest-
less Hebrew patriot. Yet the mud that has been
thrown at Barabbas for nearly 19 centuries has been
something shameful. He was mixed up in a “sedi-
tion,” says the accusation against him, and it
appears that a man was killed in the scuffle. Possi-
bly Barabbas went out on meat strike, and in the
narrow alleys of Jerusalem a very slight disturbance
about Kosher meat is liable to lead to anybody
falling down a stair and breaking his neck. Any-
how, David the Psalmist killed a lot more men than
Barabbas, and the Church hasn’t thrown mud at him.
And David didn't fight against such odds as
Barabbas. The Jew who went seditioning against the
Blight of the Roman Empire deserves a statue.
It took the Victorian Law Department a
long time to decide to prosecute on a per-
jury charge three policemen who saw a
certain woman in the street when she wasn’t
there, being in gaol. The eye of faith and
hope certainly seemed a trifle over-strained
in this case, but allowances have to be made.
It has been said that a man can’t be in two
places at once, unless he is a bird, but nobody
knows what may lianpen in John Murray's
fleeting and elusive department. The gaol
records may have been wrong. The woman
may have escaped from her cell after break-
fast, and gone back again in time for tea
without being missed. There may never
have been any such woman or any such
policemen. The prison may really have been
a bacon factory. And, anyhow, it is best
not to throw away a bad cop unless you
know where to get a better one. Even a very
improbable kind of bobby isn’t to be reck-
lessly discarded, lest it should be necessary
to hire a wholly impossible bobby in his
stead. That is why Victoria keeps Murray
as a Minister. He is certainly asleep, but if
he were awakened and sacked, or sacked and
removed insensible on his bedstead, the next
man might be dead, or he might never have
been born, or he might be a monkey.
“Norbell” : I see that the mayor of Bourke
(N.S.W.) has been advocating a supply of
ice, or waterbags, or both, for the _ trains
which meander up to his hamlet beside the
Darling. The only wonder is that. he should
have to clamor for such an obvious ease-
ment. Water bags are common features of
the Queensland railways. Also, compact little
ice-chests may be hired for a small fee. In
the cold months —and it can be very cold
up there —rugs are hired out to the shivering
passengers at sixpence a covering. Banana-
land loses the Ma State in other respects
so far as railwav comfort is concerned. For
example, the railways up North, notwith-
standing their narrow gauge, manage to
provide sleeping berths, six to a compart-
ment, for second-class passengers, at half a
crown a head. In Victoria they make ample
waterbag provision on the dusty, desert run
to Mildura; also, they have a dining car
where set meals, at set times, or tea and
coffee at all times, may be obtained. The
best appointed train in Australasia, in my
opinion, and I’ve sampled most of the long-
distance vehicles, is the Perth-Ivalgoorlie
or Goldfields express. After the inexpensive
and excellent dinner is over the tables are
cleared in the dining-car, and passengers
may sit and smoke, and swap wild-cat lies
and telluride yarns, and sell mines to each
other, whilst the white-coated stewards will
supply any liquid refreshment from cham-
pagne to shandy—good liquor, and at ordi-
nary hotel rates. It occurs to me that it is-
about time the N.S.W. railway people got
a move on, as regards making existence on
their lines a shade less like Johnson.
“Two Seas”: A military camp is being
formed hereabouts, and for days past the
main road to it has been crowded with
vehicles carrying deck-chairs, camp-bedsteads,
lemonade and other implements of war; but
on the Sabbath all was peace, until the
writer, who was hurrying to Sunday-school,
was nearly slung into the dust through his
horse propping at the sight of a wheel lying
in the centre of the road. It was a perfectly
sound wheel and newly painted; and as a
wheel usually attracts some attention when
it parts company with a vehicle one is riding
in, this scribe, seeing no one in sight, rode on
his way marvelling. But, cantering around
a bend in the road, the puzzle was solved.
Trotting briskly ahead was a team of four
horses drawing an Army Service waggon
which was minus a hind wheel. There were
two drivers riding postilion fashion, three
warriors seated in the waggon, and another
mounted warrior riding as escort to the out-
fit. The writer has seen some humorous
sights during a varied career, but nothing
on sea or land ever struck him as so wildly
hilarious as that A.A.S. Corps waggon bowl-
ing gaily along on its precarious way, whilst
the blissfully unconscious warriors sat ad-
miring the scenery, feeling, no doubt, that
all was well whilst the watchful escort rode
gravely alongside of them. And far behind
lay that wheel in the middle of the dusty
road, with its face upturned to the blazing
sun, mutely appealing to, heaven against
such casual treatment. When a horseman,
faint with excessive laughter, overtook them
the outfit had stopped at the first pub in
town. A thirsty soul seated on the door-
step had drawn attention to the unusual
appearance of the conveyance, but none of
the warriors appeared to be at all disturbed.
The escort casually inquired : “Did you see
anything of a wheel along the road, mate?’"
and when he was informed that he would
find it about a mile and a half back lie
merely remarked that it was “a bit of hard
luck having to go that far for the blinded
thing.” The proverbial “luck of the British
Army” must have alighted upon that wag-
gon during its mile and a half trip on three
wheels over a bumpy road.
“Trotter’s” brief story, told in spasms, of
a country which has the biasings of “foreign
capital”- —heaps of it: —
While educated Mexicans have been making politi-
cal speeches in belltoppers and frock coats American
and European fatmen have taken possession. Four
centuries of incessant working have only scratched
the treasures of the country. In that time Mexico
has produced one-third of the world’s silver. The oil,
as yet hardly tapped, may make Mexico the greatest
producer of that, too. It has more railroads than
any other Spanish-American country. Its large cities
have well-developed street railways, electric lighting
and Dower plants. Yet the Mexicans are very poor,
'there are only 15,000,000 of them in what Hum-
boldt called the world's storehouse. The country be-
longs to outsiders. Apart from the baronial families,
who own enormous tracts of land, and a small mino-
rity of the mercantile and educated, the Mexicans
have nothing. Nearly 10,000,000 of them are illite-
rate. The oil is owned by Americans and English.
The banks are mostly French. The wholesalers and
the considerable retailers are foreign. The mines are
all foreign. The railroads were built and are handled
by Americans, though Europeans are the largest
holders of the railroad securities. Diaz wanted the Eng-
lish to have the oil; Madero favored the Americans.
Some trace the revolution to this. Huerta, the vil-
lain, wants to nationalise oil!. Do you wonder that
such a scoundrel must be got rid of! Nationalisa-
tion ? Let the country own it! Shut foreign capital
out of it? Why, what would the country be without
foreign capital ? Was there ever, I wonder, a country
so impoverished, so degraded, that that question was
not asked ?
The Bulletin received the accompanying
anthem. The writer doesn’t specify whether
the letter is for publication or not, so the
signature is cut out. This paper will have
the greatest pleasure in reprinting said let-
ter, with the writer’s real name attached,
if so desired :
New Zealand, Gisborne. February Fourteenth.
Dear Sir I am sending you a copy of what I think
we very much need that is an Australasian Antham.
I may say that I have taken a lot if times and
pains to get it perfect and as I am a bad writer
having hurt my hand fencing I borrowed a typ-
writer from a friend of mine but I can only make
it write big letters as I am not used to it. I have
got a tune in my head for it which goes Humpty
Humpty Turn Tar Umpty Dumpty Dumpty Urnty
Do I darsay you will be able to folow ot and I
think it will be a fine thing for Australasia. I may
sav that this is the six go I have had at writing with
the typ writer before I. got it to ggo right and my
friend is away.
1 am sir yours very truly, .
P S The boys all round think it is a lovly song
and pleese put it I mean it in a promenent place
and sign Arthur Humpy as that is my nick name.
AUSTRALASIA.
The sun that shineds New Zealand on shines on Aus-
tralia too j
We are your brothers of the land off beer and
kangeroo .
And when the mighty wings of war sing oer Aus-
tralias planes
New Zealands sons will hump their guns through
wars devouering flames.
Corpus.
Australasia Australasia. When your bloody foes shall
chase you. .
Then twil be to die or do in the Land of Kangeroo
All New Zealand has to give shall be yours and you
shall live .. r a
We will make those mongrols scoot from the Lund
of Bandevcoot.
And should they try New Zealand first Australia will
be there , , , ~
To help us hold our land so free and also devil
may care.
So when the Jap and Chinee Hoggs come at the
game of games
Australias sons will hump their guns with c.eathless
breathless names.
Them the Coreus Again.
And when again peice rains within our Australasian
Our veterrans shall teach their sons with oft re-
peated tales .
Of how the Australasian boys up held their glorious
names „ ,
For they are the ones the sons of guns who swam
thrill£h wars red flames.
Then Comes the Coreus Again.
THE BELOVED DEMON.
[FOR THE BULLEIN.]
Foolish is the young man who imagines that in
the married state the demon of temptation will neve?
dangle before his eyes the forbidden fruit, nor cause
his heart to grow weary of what he lias, and hanker-
after what he cannot have without sin.
—Bishop Phelan (Vic .).
I might have married, long ago,
Phrynette or Dora —both were dears !
Or sev’ral other girls. But, no !
I entertained the gravest fears
That, having won to wedded bliss,
No more for damsels would I sigh,
With mouths and tresses ripe to kiss.
I feared to think what I might miss,
If, living under Hymen’s eye,
Temptation theru should pass me by!
Forbidden fruit is sweet to steal.
In fact, if of the; ban bereft,
No longing for it might one feel
Enough to justify the theft!
Though life is short, and love is, too,
New loves for old ones may be had.
Life’s outlook need be never blue
If love’s illusion we renew ;
And churls and prudes alone are sad,
For sin was sent to make us glad!
“Though wedded, nn’.n is tempted still”—
These are the words of one who knows!
Thus, having gilded Hymen’s pill,
Another bar to marriage goes.
Proud with the pride .of scanty years, t
Temptation still I wish to meet, >
And grapple with when it appears;
Like one not knowing craven fears,
To fight it hard, however sweet,
A.-id, in the end, to .strike defeat!
VICTORIA.

MELBOURNE and LONDON.
Sydney feels quite lonesome without its
meat strike. The general terms of settle-
ment were that the Board shall promptly
reconsider its award with a view to granting
better terms, and in the meantime work
shall be resumed and the axe buried. The
humorous feature of the bargain is the
promise to obey the law a little better in
future. The poor old industrial law is a
very humble thing, and has to rely on the
forbearance of the unions to prevent it
being knocked into a cocked hat.
The latest shooting exhibition by a lady
(a Sydney tailor’s cutter was her particular
target) might have been stopped after the
first shot or two, if someone had had suffi-
cient presence of mind to shout loudly and
fill the air with trailing bundles of cloths,
chairs, measuring sticks and any other sun-
dries ready to his hand. But instead of
interrupting her in this gay, distracting
fashion, every tailor present froze in his
tracks at the sight of her revolver, and
suffered her to put two more bullets into the
cutter and empty the last couple of cart-
ridges into her own tumultuous bosom. Then,
all being over and the shop filled with a
battlefield smell, two spell-breaking police-
men arrived and carted the principals away
for repairs. This hold-up by a shaky, hys-
terical woman happened in King-street, the
busiest thoroughfare of Sydney, on Saturday
midday, the busiest part of the week. There
are some bright possibilities hereabout for a
prompt gang of armed townrangers with a
fast motor-in-waiting.
The old, tireless struggle, on the part of
the Australian daily newspapers, to educate
the masses still persists. Last week the
Sydney Telegraph announced in its cable
news from Berlin that
Two editors, Herr Weltam and Herr Montag, have
been summoned for insulting the Crown Prince.
The Melbourne Age referred to the alleged
editors as “Weltam and Montagu.” Die
Welt am Montag (“The World on Mon-
day”) is one of the best-known weeklies in
Germany. Picture the hilarity of the Syd-
ney paper if a Berlin daily referred to the
misfortunes of a couple of London editors
named respectively Mr. Saturday and Mr.
Review. Or if it got into trouble itself and
mention was made of the arrest of Mr. Tele
and Mr. Graph.

POLITICAL
POINTS
RISKY.
LITTLE JOE: "Th’ only thing I'm afraid of
is that it might squib an' put me light
out!"
Direct Action, an organ of the Industrial
Workers of the World —the crowd which de-
nounces the Labor party as too slow, and
savs, “Damn all agreements”—has appeared
in Sydney. It says in its introductory
appeal:—
We drop our “h’s” in conversation, our composi-
tion is faulty and our punctuation abominable.
“Meat-Hunter”: I read -with interest, in
John D. Fitzgerald’s letter of last week, his
explanation as to why the rents of Daceyville
were fixed at a rate which leaves a dead
loss: —
The Board had to fix the rents before the returns
of costs were available for the first houses built.
This might occur to any private owner, but in his
case he would have left a margin on his side.
But Daceyville doesn’t belong to any private
owner. So far as I can see, it was a ques-
tion of giving the benefit of the doubt to the
community which owns Daceyville, or to the
privileged handful who are supplied with ex-
traordinarily cheap houses there. The com-
munity lost and the privileged handful won.
Ex-Prime Minister Fisher, speaking at
Ringwood (Vic.) last week, said it was the
duty of the State to see that every man who
was willing to work had work to do. Cer-
tainly, but the State can’t find work for
everybody out of loans. So, to begin with,
the State must either see that local wages
are so low or the tariff so high that the
worker can compete against the imported
goods which are always trying to eat away
the props of his job. A mere assertion of
the Right to Work counts for no more than
an assertion of the right of every man to
have plenty of hair and a well-shaped nose.
The moral claim may be there, but if the
goods aren’t what benefit accrues?
THE TAXPAVERS’ TOPHET.
Alderman Campbell said that if the trams and
trains were run as a commercial undertaking, they
would pay handsomely. It was only through carry-
ing a number of “deadheads” that they did not pay.
The Mayor (Aid. Brracluff) agreed that the “dead-
head” system conduced to the deficit.
—Waverley Council item.
C ONDUCTORUS: “ Fares , please!”
CHORUS OF D EADHEADUS: "He'll pay for us!"
The polished Premier Holman, who slides
off the Labor platform like a whale off an
iceberg, had a few words to say the other
night in the Assembly concerning the N.S.W.
Government’s futile mishandling of the
Sydney meat strike. This is the best he
could offer -
Personally 1 find that many hon. members are
able to bear up with much philosophy under the
suspension oi the supply of their accustomed viands,
and I only hope that philosophy will be shared by
the general public who wait so many hours in the
rain outside the existing meat depots to get their
supplies.
Exactly what he was driving at is probably
only known to the seven devils that howl
continuously round Judas Iscariot. He and
his colleagues threw many blossoms at them-
selves for their splendid Conciliation and
Arbitration and anti-strike legislation. And
when Holman hasn’t the courage or the
honesty to enforce his boasted law where a
handful of his own supporters are concerned,
lie takes refuge in a shambling and pointless
jest about the poor people who waited in the
rain to try to secure a bit of meat for
dinner.
One of. the recent foolish deeds of the
British suffragettes was the burning of the
White Kirk of Haddington—a
Scotch structure that had braved
the storms for 617 years. It was
a quiet, peaceful, harmless speci-
men of ancient architecture. It
had no vote. It had never objected
to women having a vote. It had
never forcibly fed anybody. It
was more a woman’s than a man’s
property, for women use the church
much more than men. And it
was the emblem of a dour old Pres-
byterianism which is very uncom-
promising when its sacred things
are touched. Burning a Presby-
terian’s historic kirk is like giving sass and
back talk to a shark in its own element.
G. T. C. Miller, the Monaro foghorn, is
said by an interjection in N. S. Wales
Assembly the other night to have slipped
out a Caucus secret that it is intended to
pass an Act altering the life of Parlia-
ments, including the present one, from
three years to four. Even if the oracle for
hanging on to an extra year of office and
snatching an additional £500 apiece (at
least), could be worked constitutionally it
is quite certain that Holman and co. have
no mandate from the constituencies to that
end.
Definition of a strike, by John Estell,
Minister for Labor in the N.S.W. Cabinet: —-
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PUBLIC, with
regard to the law, I desire to say that strikes are
those untoward incidents involving social mischief
which arise in the course of the purposive interaction
of antipathetic industrial interests within the com-
munity.
Which is as comprehensive as a dead ele-
phant at the bottom of an undiscovered coal
mine.
The Ma State got a shock last week when
it learned that new taxation to the extent
of about £1,000,000 a year was to be im-
posed in one huge act—some of it to be re-
trospective by way of rubbing the insult in
good and hard. Nothing so tremendous ever
happened all at once to Ma at any previous
time in her history. Some people have a
foolish idea that the object of a loan policy
is to invest the borrowed money so that it
will pay interest and yield a trifle of profit,
but the Holman gang of incapables doesn’t
work on these lines. Its great ambition is
to raise money at about 4i per cent., and
invest it at 2 per cent, or so, and then in-
crease the tram fares to make good the loss.
It is in the position of a man who pawned
his furniture to acquire a hyena and spent
the rest of his life toiling to buy food for
the beast.
The Labor Government of
N. S. Wales is, it seems, quite
as ingenious as other employers
in dodging wages-board awards.
It has just established a big
bakery to supply bread to public
institutions, and the goods are
to be rushed, hot from the oven,
to the scattered homes and hos-
pitals in motor-vans. But, as
it is ingeniously explained, in
order that the men who' cart the
bread will not be bread-carters
and thus get the benefits of the
bread-carters’ awards, they will
be met at the institutions by offi-
cials, who will take for them-
selves what bread they want;
and thus the bread-carters won’t
be bread-carters —they will be
chauffeurs. With the help of
this and other brilliant flashes of
statesmanship it is expected presently to
supply cooked dough at a penny a pound.
Sydney Telegraph on Saturday published
a list of the ten greatest inventions of the
last few years. And among them all it
didn’t mention (1) the Socialistic tiger; (2)
the flight of capital out of the country; (3)
the reasons for giving Nielsen £4 a day to go
to America; (4) the rainfall at the Federal
capital; (51 Reid’s dry dog; (6) the con-
scientious objector to military training; (7)
the need for colored labor in the Northern
Territory; (8) the majority at Willoughby
(N.S.W.) ; (9) our “great natural re-
sources”; (10) the N.S.W. loan boom. So
the paper missed ten times out of ten.
ALONG THE MURRAY.
N.S.W. Minister Carmichael an-
nounces that £1000 of the special
annual vote for purchasing pic-
tures must be expended this year
by the trustees of the National
Art Gallery upon the purchase of
works by New South Wales artists.
—News item,
This kind of thing will soon
become quite common.
The Federal capital lives steadily up to
the reputation which the Government
Weather Bureau gives it as the driest spot
within 200 miles of the N.S.W. coast. Dur-
ing the heavy February rains, Cooma,
Queanbeyan and Yass, the three observing
stations nearest to Canberra, received —
Cooma one-eighth, the other pair one-twelfth
of an inch. And so far as March has gone
almost every place on the coast or table-
land or western slopes has reported moisture
bar these three.
BULL AND ANOTHER FREE ! RATE
BLESSING.
England could be starved out in three weeks.

THE OLD 'UN : “ ’Tain't that I'm at alt
afraid of 'em get tin' in here to harm me
—but s’posin' they sneaked round the corner
an' cut me food-pipe !”
The Victorian Methodist Conference has
done the usual thing and given a solid vote
in support of its useless and costly and
drinlcy and blasphemous friend the book-
maker, and has done it under the usual pre-
tence of condemning the tote in the public
interest. What size of a cheque Moses
draws on the Bank of Jerusalem in return
for all this support many people would like
to know.
In spite of all protests from the parsons,
the N. S. Wales Tramway Department is
going to keep on running the Sydney cars
during church-hour on Sunday evenings.
“Old-man” Harper, for the Commissioners,
didn’t waste time discussing the question. He
only pointed out that 40,000 passengers were
getting into the cars in that hour every week.
The Lord may have the arguments, but the
Devil has the cash ; and Cohen, whose money
has built the trams, wants cash and not
arguments. Besides, Cohen’s Synagogue day
is Saturday.
Prime Minister Cook was recently at the
Federal Capital of Dustyberra, and was
shocked right down to his ungainly boots at
the amount of work that is being done there
out of revenue —not loans. He said that
the way “the taxpayers were being exploited
for the benefit of future generations” was
extraordinary. It is amazing how the con-
firmed borrower hates his children, and how
mad he is at the idea of leaving them even
a place like Dustyberra without a mortgage
on it.
AN UNFORTUNATE OCCURRENCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
An extraordinary incident transpired here to-day
Everything was in readiness for the big final battle
of the manoeuvres, when it was found that there was
no ammunition, so the fight was postponed.
It was a most unfortunate occurrence.
—S. M. Herald.
When the force went into action it was noticed with
surprise
That the shrapnel wasn’t bursting as it fell upon
the rise
Three miles distant, where the enemy was lying
snugly hid ;
That it didn't do the damage that it really should
have did.
“Oh, dammit!” yelled the General to an orderly,
“Ride like Hell, and find out what’s the
reason !’’....
Was it damnable neglect, or was it treason ?
Here the orderly returned. “Well, tell us what the
news is?”. . . .
(Salute) “It seems, sir, that the Ordnance Depart-
ment, when ordering shiapnel, forgot to order
fuses 1”
Then they hurried the machine-guns to the front;
when it was seen
That the foe was not laid out in the way he should <
have been
By the hose-like showers o l bullets which ifcossi
deadly weapons throw
When they’re adequately served against an onward-
coming foe.
“Well, by blanky!” shrieked the General as he
watched his own torn ranks,
“If the dash, dash blue-brown blazes haven’t fur-
nished us with blanks 1”
But the charge was very near now, and there wasn’t
time to think ;
They were at us with the bayonet—and our chaps
began to shrink ;
Well, we had that left us (as we thought), but,
Horror l where to find
A bayonet in the whole brigade?. . . .They’d all been
left behind!
“Ye gods!” exclaimed the General, “mere swearing’s
useless now ;
Sound the Retreat! Australia’s beat —O Lord, and
beaten how?”
A bullet hit him in the head ; he tumbled from his
horse....
Before the foeman’s bayonets fast lied our broken
force....
[the report.]
To the Honorable the Minister for Defence, —I much
deplore
That on the fourth we lost heavily in action at
Bungendore;
The G.O.G. himself was killed; also some fifty score
Of officers, with eight thousand men; very likely
more ;
Returns incomplete; wounded number thirteen thou-
sand ; much gore ;
Rest of army missing, except what were captured ;
Fear on receipt of news you will not be enraptured.
Disaster due to fuseless shrapnel and blank cart-
ridges for the machine-guns ;
Disaster rendered irreparable when found bayonets
left behind at depot of Smith and Sons,
Sydney. Advise Australia to surrender. —Yours,
grievedly, Lawrence.”
“Dear me,” murmured the Minister. “What an
unfortunate occurrence!’

LADIES’ NURSE
STRONGLY RECOMMENDS DR.
MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS.
There is no person who comes so inti-
mately into the life of the sick as the nurse.
She stands next to the doctor, watching and
noting the effect of treatment and medicines,
and becomes only second to him as an autho-
rity. A nurse of 24 years’ experience in
Rozelle, Sydney, who has recommended Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills in many cases,
says she cannot speak too highly of them,
and that in all cases they have proved equal
to the needs of patients.
As an old resident of Rozelle for 32 years,
out of which I have spent 24 years nursing.”
writes Mrs. Margaret Gallan, of 3a Moodie
Street, off Western Road, Rozelle, “I can
safely say that Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills have my best recommendation to my
patients for occasional use after their con-
finements. They have proved in all cases
most satisfactory, and I speak from practical
experience of their use. In my home they
occupy a place as our family medicine, and
both young and old members take them
when necessary.”*
SPORTING
NOTIONS
Last week an attempt was made to tack a
Totalisator Bill on to the tail end of the programme
for the N.S.W. session. But someone arose apd
opposed the machine on the ground that the revenue
which passed through it would be “tainted.” This
argument will not stand inspection. If the person
who put it forward will think for a moment he will
recognise that the Tote’s money is not so likely to
be “tainted” as that of the bookmaker. The man
with the bag has to pay fees, and some of the cash
goes into revenue. Also, the bookie pays income
tax on his tainted money with a tainted cheque.
And the most teetotal member of the caucus doesn’t
mind taking the publican’s tainted beer money in the
shape of income-tax, probate, stamp duty and all
manner of things. The tainted land-tax money for
the ground that the brothel and the gambling club
stand on isn’t objected to by one single saint
in the crowd. The peculiarity about the Tote busi-
ness is just this :
(1) It is the only source of revenue which is con-
sistently denounced by holy folk as “tainted.”
(2) It represents the only case in which a very
rich opposing vested interest is able, and more than
willing, to pay holy folk to be publicly shocked at
the idea of taking “tainted” money.
There really stems to be too much beastly coinci-
dence and unanimity about the matter. There are
times when a little coincidence goes a long way.
“O’Cork,” his growl: Among the New-
market items apparently unknown to punters and
press this year was the fact that last year lownit
not only figured as candidate for the big V.R.C.
sprint, but was regarded by his connections as the
purest of morals for it. A few days before the race,
however, he went wrong and was taken back to South
Aus., there to be tended and treasured until the
time was ripe for the curiously-named son of Grafton
and My Own to tackle the “straight six” at Flem-
ington 12 months later. Of Wallalo, winner of the
Australian Cup, Sydney Sun’s Melbourne correspon-
dent, who last spring mentioned the ancient Matouree
as a likely one for the Victorian Derby, again pro-
claims himself (or herself) a first-class turf guide by
wiring over: “It is now discovered that the chestnut
has won 13 of his 35 races, and has scored 10 minor
places. This remarkable horse has even taken two
first prizes and one second in three hurdle races.”
But Wallalo was a Cup candidate last spring, and
as such his performances, placed and unplaced, were
given in Miller’s Sporting Pamphlet, published
months before the Cup. Do not the turf scribes make
a practice of running through all the performances in
the Pamphlet and ticking off the best for future
reference? Evidently not. Too well-fed and care-
less, perhaps. Had they done so last year, Wallalo
would probably have had some mention for the Aus.
Cup before he started the dogs barking his name by
winning the Essendon Stakes on the first day. This
present scribe sent a certain weekly four rank out-
siders for the Newmarket, and lownit was one of
them, also Wallalo to win the Aus. Cup, the latter
because he knew many of the runners would be
“held” until the A.J.C. meeting (Sydney Cup, etc.)
next month. But the best Newmarket and Aus. Cup
tip of 1914 was not printed.
H. Gray, the Maoriland jockey, has
nothing to learn from the boys of this continent.
He rode two excellent races on Wallalo, the gee he
was specially engaged for. Good horses make suc-
cessful jockeys, of course, but there is more than one
way of handling a good animal, and Gray’s way of
saving up Wallalo for a dash at the finish was a
caution to some of the h—ll-for-leather chaps.
* * * *
Desire presumably closed his racing
account when he broke down in the Newmarket
Handicap last week. The brilliant little Tasmanian
horse had to be rested for 18 months after his
triumphant season in Melbourne two years ago, and
this second going-wrong suggests that he will n'ot
stand another preparation. The stable reckoned him
equal to winning the Australian Cup if his doubtful
leg would permit. As a 3-year-old the perky little
fellow ran seven times for five wins, one second (in
the Futurity Stakes), and one fourth place (in the
Oakleigh Plate). He won at 6,7, 8 and 12 fur-
longs, and carried Bst. 131 b. at the last time of

Agar Wynne won a 2-year-old race at
Flemington last week with Toast, by Malster—Pra-
leen The dam has been a fairly consistent success
at the stud, asd Mr. Wynne must have done well
with her offspring. Apple Pie and Cider are both
by Ayr Laddie from Pralccn.
The Australian Cup this year was an in-
teresting race insofar that the pace was always good
and the struggle for the last mile resolved itself into
the simple question whether anything could overtake
the pace-maker, Uki. This ancient gelding, carrying
6st. 81b. only, was out to do its best from the
start m the interests of Parisian, the top weight.
H k i, wa,s never more than about eight lengths ahead
of the nearest pursuer, but he stuck to his work, and
was still three lengths to the good when making the
last turn for home. Then it looked as though only
Wallalo, Calamus and Matouree had a ghost of a
chance of overtaking the leader. Wallalo—a true
son of Wallace—came along from the distance post
. ' v ’° n ■ masterfully, but Calamus never reached
ki• Had a mishap befallen Wallalo in the race the
result would have been Uki (s.p. 100 to 1), Calamus
(S.p. 50 to 1), Matouree (s.p. 33 to 1), and the
time would still have been good, for, as it was the
winner clipped lisec. off the record. The Parisian,
though he finished fifth, had never looked really
dangerous. He was almost as slow as his recent
performances in w.f.a. races had made him out to be.
Trauier Wheeler must have “kidded” himself into
the belief that his old champion was still young
enough to do a brilliant dash on an easy prepara-
tion. As for the other nags that had been
greatly fancied a while ago or more recently, they
were sick or sorry hopes. The lumbering Harpist was
sore and out of sorts, Coradil had gone off, likewise
Loch Amos. Prize Fighter is feeling his age
Belove, though she nearly fluked last Melbourne Cup
is no stayer, and Sea Prince’s alleged cracked heel
was seemingly an actual fact. Audacity, who ran
as badly as any. of them, can now be regarded as
one of the English horses that disimprove as they
become acclimatised. His first two races last year
were his best performances thus far.
There are two sorts of stamina in horse-
flesh. The strength that pulls the gee triumphantly
through a long gallop on heavy ground when the
time for the race is bound to be slow, and the
stoutness that enables the gee to last longest at high
speed over a hard three-miles course. As the result
of a long dry summer in Melbourne the times for
both the Australian Cup and the Champion were
records. Radnor last Saturday was fsee. better than
the previous best for the Champion, and considering
the sultry heat of the day the colt’s performance
can be accepted as a great test of stamina. The
Parisian kept him busy to the bitter end, neverthe-
less his three-quarters of a length advantage in pass-
ing the post represented a decisive victory. Three-
year-olds are unduly favored by the w.f.a. scale in
the Champion. Fourteen times in the last 25 years
a colt with 7st. 121 b. up has been too good for his
elders carrying nine stone or more. Good judges of
racing reckon that the minimum weight should be
Bst. 21b.

The Autumn Steeple at the V.R.C. meeting
was a deplorable proceeding except for the fact that
a warm favorite won. Out of nine starters, only
four got round the course, and one of the fallen lot
—Camasade —had broken its neck. Moreover, two
of the four that finished were so hopelessly out of it
that they might as well have run off for all the in-
terest they gave to the proceedings.
» * * *
Sydney prad-owners had a rocky time at
the V.R.C. Autumn meeting. Of 24 events
on the card, a strong contingent from the Ma State
secured only five, and worse than all, but one winner
is owned in Sydney. South Australia secured two,
and the prize money of the other 17 events remained
in the land of Watt.
A. Armstrong, of the Rose of Fitzroy
Club in the V.J C.A., has many of the marks of the
Coming Champion. Last season was his first in
second-grade cricket, and he took 93 wickets for
6.25 apiece. This season he has so far taken 98 at
an average cost of five runs. Ten wickets per match,
at five runs each, will take some beating.
* * * *
The upsetting effect of a compliment. No
sooner had The Bulletin said (12/2/’l4) that the
East Torrens cricket club (premiers of S.A.) had
lost only one match in 24 seasons, than it went and
lost another. Whitt.v was away hurt, and on wet
turf his colleagues let Adelaide make 118, while
Wright and Travers went through East Torrens for
102. Finishing on dry turf, they “declared” at four
for 161, but Adelaide made 142 for five, and Won
on the first innings. At the end, the fielding side
claimed to leave the field when a wicket fell, at two
(or 21) minutes from Time. The umpires agreed,
but a technical dispute was aroused, and is still
raving and howling. The Adelaides’ suggestion is
that the two minutes allowed a batsman for coming
in are merely a limit against delay, and that there
is nothing to prevent his appearing instantly if he
wants to.
Milburn Saylor lakes a roundabout way of
cracking Herb Ale Coy's ear.
An extraordinary record was compiled re-
cently at Wagga (N.S.W.), when the Hamilton
family put a cricket XI into the field against the
Half-Holiday team. A twelfth brother was in re-
serve ; likewise two sisters, equally capable of taking
a hand in the game if the family was pushed. The
team compiled 121 runs, and was beaten but not dis-
graced by 30 runs —151 to 121. On the previous
Saturday two of the brothers pasted over 200 on the
board as their joint effort, and before that three of
them placed 160 on the board. Of the 12 brothers,
10 are farming in the Wagga district; one is a
school-teacher at Yerong Creek, and the other is a
member of the mounted police at Greenethorpe, near
Grenfell. The occupations of the young ladies are
not stated. But it is a tall family of its hands, to
quote Shakspeare’s manner of speaking.
. The rise of young left-handed bowler
Clutterbuck to inter-State honors is the swiftest
thing in Australian cricket history. On Saturday
morning, January 31, he was unknown. That
afternoon, given his first trial for the North Adelaide
club, he took, on a good wicket, 6 for 39. The next
Saturday, on a very fair one, he bagged 7 for 48.
Just then a vacancy occurred in the South Aus. XI,
already chosen to meet Victoria, and the following
Friday he was taking part in a Shield match. Time,
1 week, 5 days, 18 hours.
* * * •
The rain storm that swept around and
■ over Sydney on Saturday morning made a muddied oaf •
of the 11th round of Sydney’s First Grade cricket
competition. Some of the wickets were soaked so
that play was impossible, and some were so wet that
it was difficult. Two matches, Gordon v. Petersham
and Central Cumberland v. Balmain, wsre not
started at all. As a natural result no centuries glit-
tered on the scoring board; the nearest approach to
one was the 86 of Trenerry, of Paddington. It was
followed up by-the 79 (n. 0.) of Buckle and the 64 of
W. Bardsley, both of Glebe. Callaway, of Padding-
ton, hit 65 also; Tozer, of University, made 56, and
Thatcher, of Redfern, carried his timber for 52.
Among the bowlers Massie, of University, was best
with six Western Suburbs’ sticks for 20 ; Barbour, of
the same club, got away with three for six runs, and
Randall, of Middle Harbor, bagged four Redfem
men for 43. As for the- scoring, the lions of the
afternoon roared at Glebe, which smote 202 off the
Sydney bowling for the loss of only three wickets.
Paddington also did well against Waverley, hacking
190 for the loss of four sticks. Redfern bashed 155
against Middle Harbor, and that wet place responded
with 78 for three wickets when its turn came. Uni-
versity had a great afternoon. First it ripped
through Western Suburbs for 50, went in and biffed
142 to its own credit, and got W.S. back to the
sticks. But there was no profit in it. West stuck
fast, and, when the night came down with its brolly
in its hand, and washed the players from the field,
it had piled up 20 without losing a stick.
With the end of the season in sight—for
Ass. hoofball makes an extra-early start on April 18
interest in Victorian Pennant Cricket centres on
the question which clubs will reach the “final four.”
North and South are practical certainties, but the
other two places are still open to East, Carlton, St.
Kilda and last year’s premiers, ’Wood. The efforts
of the rest are now even as the preachings of a
Sal. Army captain to a crowd of surf-bathers—vain
things. On Saturday Richmond slung in its alley,
to all intents, by collecting a paltry 131 to St.
Hilda’s 235 ; while Carlton let itself down a peg by
laboriously scraping up 165 to South’s 248, of which
Scott made 112. ’Roy put together a respectable 221,
which, however, was of no use against East’s 268—
106 n.o. of which came from the bat of the perennial
Peter McAlister. ’Wood scored a symmetrically-built
284 and began to see stars, blue devils and other
fantods when ’Varsity got 200 for seven wickets, but
the last three only yielded 13 more, so ’Wood went
home happy. Against the despised Northcote brickies,
who had made 250, the undefeated North lost five
good wickets for 100, and then settled down to play
for the draw, but the smiting 1 of the tail proved so
vigorous that the two and a half centuries, with four
to spare, were made just as stumps were drawn. P’ran
and Essendon, neither of which counts in the scheme
of things, argued the question of precedence pleas-
antly between themselves, the respective scores—296
and 215—indicating that the ’lions will continue to
occupy their inglorious place at the bottom of the
list. It is, of course, necessary that someone shall
be last, but that fact is little consolation to the
team that is there.
* * * *
The touring Australian XI. in Maori-
land smote the bowling of South Canterbury
at Temuka to the moon last week when
it piled up the mammoth score of 922 for
the loss of nine wickets in hurricane style.
Crawford was the devouring element or Dragon of
Wantley, with 354, while Trumper and Cody heaped
up 135 and 106 respectively. Why the team went
on piling up such hideous figures against a weak
side instead of declaring is hard to understand, ex-
cept on the argument of vain-glory. And if that
was the explanation it seems a pity it didn’t vain-
glory for 78 more and make the even 1000.
Athletically France is coming along at a
great rate. Frogeating pugs, headed by a trium-
phant Carpentier, are making the other nations see
stars ; while at Paris on New Year’s Day France gave
Old Ireland a fright at Rugby toeball. The French
forwards played like devils, and had six points on
the board, through scoring two tries, before the
boys from the Emerald Isle were fully awake. There
was a great scrap all through the second spell, but
Ireland’s stamina pulled the match out of the fire
at the last. Wood and Quinn both snatched very
brilliant tries, and one of them luckily being con-
verted, the Paddy' country was on top by eight to
six. But it was a near thing.
Sailing on Port Jackson (N.S.W.) on
Saturday afternoon was deadly dull, and save
for the attractions provided on the steamers
which followed it would have been the
corpse of all possible tediousness. But, for-
tunately, the girls were charming and the soda-
water excellent, so the dull racing did not matter as
much as it might have done. It was the day out
of the haughty Royal Yacht Squadron, and the
event was the Eight Metre Championship. The wind,
which came occasionally from the north-east, was
for the most part in hospital, though it tantalised
the agonised skippers by freshening up spasmodically.
I hen just as the boats started, it would die alto-
gether, and be buried with tombstones at its head
and feet. But before the boats got back weeping
from the funeral, that fitful zephyr would rise
like Lazarus, and get to business once again. There
were five mourners at the funeral, and of these
Petrel and Yeulba were easily the most attractive,
the features of the race were the handling of the
craft at Manly buoy and the manoeuvring off Shark
i s ‘ a .nd. I he handicaps were given at the start.
While the limit boats were being sent off, Yeulba
and Petrel cruised along the line, each alert for any
movement on the part of the other. As they came
round the flag fell, and just then the wind cut its
throat and committed suicide. When things got into
repair once more Yeulba caught whatever was going,
and staggered over the line, five seconds late. Petrel
with the coffin under its arm, was 13sec. behind
Yeulba After that, it became a game of chess and
a catching of cat’s-paws. The display of ballooners
and extras was something calculated to live in the
memory till the last beer is drunk. At long last
Petrel beat Yeulba for first place, and Curlew came
v * !i m \ j second place on the ground that
Yeulba had hit the Shark Island rounding mark.
Anyhow, it was a joyful circumstance that something
was hit any biff was calculated to put life into
the stagnant afternoon, during which about 32 decent
fellows had rashly undertaken to board and lodge as
many girls for the of their natural lives.
The same afternoon - saw a private race
between Rawhiti, Sayonara and Culwulla III. Not
much of it was seen from the steamer. The three
were skippered by professional yachtsmen, and they
started on their journey nearly half an hour .after
the scratch boats in the eight metre contest had got
away. Culwulla lead round the Manly buoy with
Sayonara about a minute behind, and Rawhiti
last about the same time away. At the
Pl , ] ?, Li 8' 1 ? t Sayonara had passed Culwulla
which managed to put Rawhiti about. Then
came the display of canvas, and the yachts them-
selves were lost to view. The great clouds of drap-
ery blew slowly along the gleaming though stagnant
water, and later on it was learned that the first cloud

haberdashery at the end was Culwulla III.
n got off two heats and a
final but there was no enthusiasm in it. In the
first heat Pastime drifted home first. In the second
the finish happened in a faint burst of breeze, and
Kismet romped in. In the final Nimrod and Mona
?” e i aS J a r a f. Ta .Vl° r Bay, where Mona
was in the lead. But shortly afterwards Nimrod,
hunting round, chased and caught enough wind to fill
a Paper bag, went to the front and won dead easy
with Advance second and Arline wearily shoving a
scrap of zephyr in front of it, third. b

Sports at Sydney last week John Hop Tom Maher
proved it a reasonable claim. He was told to walk
a certain time and then had to say what the distance
was. Wan hondred yarrds ’zactly!” said he, and
the tape proved him to be but one inch out Then
everybody fell down dead twice.
A GROCER’S RECOMMENDATION.
“For the past 20 years,” says Mr. R. Harrison,
grocer, Parramatta Road and Catherine Street,
Leichhardt, N.S.W. “I have been a sufferer from
diarrhoea, and although I have tried doctors’ prescrip-
tions have found nothing relieve me like Chamber-
lain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy. I always keep a
bottle for my own use at my private residence and
at my store.”*
The gods smiled on Australasia in the
draw for the Davis Cup. Australasia biffs into
Canada as a pipe opener, and the winner of that
tussle tackles Germany on the sauerkraut’s native
heath. In the other draw the British Isles con-
fronts Belgium, and the winner takes on France.
Considering the weakness of Germany and Canada
the Australasians have more than Buckley’s chance
of getting into the final scramble.

N.S.W. Swimming League has shown horse
sense by declining to join hands with the
Professional Athletic League and the N.S.W. League
of Wheelmen in a proposal to introduce and foster
betting 'at all professional sports. The idea was a
putrid one, for wherever the bookmaker has come
on the scene in such sports, his appearance has been
the beginning of the end. He creates such effluvia
that the game has at last to be sold for bonedust.
N.S.W. Rugby Union is in ecstasy
over a biv coup it scored last week. Last season
the Rugby League held the Agricultural, the Cricket
and the Sports Grounds in Sydney. The Union was
practically restricted to the University Field. How
it was managed deponent knoweth not, but by
some means or other the Union got in early and
snatched the Sports Ground for the coming season
right out of the jaws of the League. It is the
breath of life to the struggling Union, which, of
course, expects visits from Queensland and the “All
Blacks.”
The Yankee Athletic Team wandered
into Auckland (M.L.) on its way home, and cleaned
up another record—to wit, the putting of the shot.
The Australasian record stood at 44ft. 9l\n. Caughey,
the burly Yankee, hurled the thing 44ft. lOin. Bid
he was beaten in hurling the hammer by local man
Wallace, who tossed the implement 111 ft. 7in.
against Caughey’s 110 ft. Bin. Power gathered in the
880 yards, and Templeton in the long jump cleared
20ft. 3in. Power also won the mile. In the 880
yards Power’s time was lmin. 59 l-ssec. So if the
track was in good order his time was deadly slow —
the world’s best is Meredith’s lmin. 52isec. He ran
the mile in 4min. 35 3-ssee. —the record is 4min.
12Jsee. Power is not in any way among the world’s
first-flighters, but he is still far superior to our best
It’s enough to drive one to drink.

To get a good seat at Sydney Stadium
his coining Saturday night it will be necessary to
leave home a few minutes earlier, as according to
all the portents there is going to be a record crowd
to watch the Jeff Smith —Eddie McGoorty battle.
And it should be worth seeing. It is for the Middle
Weight Championship of the world. McGoorty,
who has been fighting since he was 15 years old,
when he won the 1301 b. amateur championship of
Wisconsin, has a long and honorable list of scrums
behind him. He has been defeated only twice, by
Tom Lancaster, in Dublin, Ireland, in 1909, and
Jimmy Clabby at Butte, Montana, in 1913. Jeff
Smith’s record does not appear in either the latest
T. S. Andrews or R. K. Fox record books. Why, is-
hard to understand. He has fought 44 battles, and
won 39. Four were drawn, and his only defeat was
at the hands of Georges Carpentier.
The meeting of Herbert McCoy and Mil-
burn Saylor at Sydney Stadium on Saturday night
was a smite of no mean dimensions. A large fist
at the end of a strong and long, and apparently
double-jointed arm, the said arm attached to a long,
lithe body, with a small head at the far end of it
directing operations, and two small, tapering legs
to move around on —that was what McCoy found
himself up against. For his size, writer has never
seen a man with a more effective reach than Saylor.
It is a fact that many of his right smashes flew
clear round McCoy’s head and bashed the Australian
on the RIGHT ear. Think of it. Also, Saylor was
taller, and, apparently, stronger. Although there
was only 12oz. difference in their weights there was
a notable disparity in their physique, and Saylor
had all the advantage of it. Both were in perfect
condition, but McCoy’s only hope of reaching the
face of his opponent was to show superior speed.
For a time he had it, and with lightning-like jabs
found Saylor’s nose and mouth repeatedly. For three
solid rounds he hit Saylor and managed to dodge all
the American’s swings, or when he could not dodge
them, he blocked them. But in the fourth round
Saylor got into holts, and McCoy clung to his left
glove, and Saylor waved the boa-constrictor he calls
his arm and hit with his right. The fist came down
on the back of the head and the neck. It speaks
volumes for McCoy’s stamina that he stood it. That
was Saylor’s one effective wallop. Time and agnin
he got it home, and beat McCoy to the floor Several
times. When it did not land on the head it fell on
the loins and all over the back. McCoy was being
attacked behind, and didn’t know what to do about
it. But with his well-known courage he fought on,
and often when he seemed to be quite groggy he
would suddenly flash out most brilliantly, and send
Saylor’s swings wide of the mark by dashing in and
driving up the left. Saylor’s head being a mere
pinhead at the butt-end of his arm, McCoy had to
be an excellent shot to hit it, and it was whisked
out of the way so quickly that only lightning speed
could catch it. But McCoy caught it often and
hard. He scored at the beginning of nearly every
round, and then, through his insane act of holding
the Yankee’s left glove, Saylor would catch him, and
with a wild succession of circular swipes wipe out
the points. The end came in the 18th, when Saylor
twice surrounded McCoy and cut off his retreat.
The second time McCoy went down, and rolled over
on his back. His corner called to him to take his
time, and he slowly commenced to rise to his knees.
There he waited, while to this writer both clock and
referee seemed to count 10. Then he scrambled
up. Saylor was waiting for him, but Scott stepped
between, and saying something, placed his hand on
Saylor’s head. By this time McCoy, who has wonder-
ful recuperative powers, was all right, and quite ready
to resume, and could hardly believe he had been
counted out. But he was.
Saylor is an excellent fighter, but he knows no
more about boxing than a chimpanzee. He hits from
anywhere and everywhere, and he hits with force all
the time. But his fighting career will be short. It
is inevitable that before long he will break his fore-
arm and depreciate his fists. AVhile he meets men
who are very little faster than himself and unable to
hit a single knock-out blow he will continue to win.
But his funeral will arrive when he meets a man as
fast as Harry Stone or one who can hit like Jerry
Jerome or Pat Bradley. If he would only learn to
box, and not do his best to smash up his own
weapons, he might develop into a world beater.
With his reach he could land twice as often if he
lashed out scientifically.

manian firm.
That Sydney nine days’ wonder, the Wag-
ner-Phypers case of about two years ago,
was recalled last week by the belated news
of the sequel. Margaret Phypers first came
into the limelight by the general magnificence
with which she surrounded herself; and then
the tinted beams fell on her when her hus-
band secured a divorce with costs and £B5O
damages against the co-re. Hardly had the
dust of that case started to settle when the
lady was made co-re. in the case of Mrs.
Wagner versus her husband. There was no
trouble about the case, Wagner and the ex-
Mrs. Phypers having gone to ’Frisco. Wag-
ner’s dream of bliss lasted less than a year.
The lady went off with a wight named
Stuart, to whom she was married on the
steamer between ’Frisco and Honolulu. They
stayed in Honolulu for the honeymoon, and
were having a heavenly time when Wagner
dropped from the clouds, with thunder in his
eye and great excitement in his right hand.
He fired at and mortally wounded Mrs.
Stuart, and then shot himself dead. Stuart
went back to ’Frisco, and, though he may
not have noticed it, he was about the only
man who had any luck in the whole compli-
cation.

Trajectory is not everything. A sportsman wants not merely to hit hut to
Stop his quarry. The Ross .280 High Velocity, using the Ross Sporting .280
cartridge with copper tube expanding bullet (patented)—see cut
at left—combines great range with great shocking power. No
matter the distance, any large game will fall if fairly hit by
this bullet, the soft nose of which collapses compressing the air
in tube and mushrooming the bullet
with terribly destructive effect.

“Hamer”: A milkman recently faced a Sydney
Court with a new explanation. He didn’t deny
that he had..been guilty of milk-dilution. For that
matter, had he done so, the circumstantial evidence
of an extra can on his cart, half-full of water,
would have ruined his case. But he claimed that he
only supplied watered milk to those who wouldn’t
pay their accounts. He seemed to consider it equit-
able that bad pays should get bad goods. The Court
fined him the usual trifle, which was quite logical.
If people didn’t pay him why should he take the
trouble to drive his exhausted and unpaid nag to their
doors at all?

“0.K.”: The Asiatic Oil Trust, which masquerades
in Australia as The British Imperial Oil Co., lately
moved into new marble-and-mahogany headquarters
in London. On a tablet at the entrance is a list of
the names of the companies merged in this mighty
concern. There are eight Asiatic petroleum cos. in
addition to the Anglo-Egyptian, the Helouan, the
Ivotuku, the Ceram, the North Caucasian, and others.
Sir Marcus Samuel, the “British Imperial” chair-
man, who is chairman also of the Shell Transport
and Trading Co.,.said, at a recent meeting of share-
holders: “At the end of the year 1912 we had in our
service SOU Europeans, 3865 Chinese, and 15;lil9 Java-
nese and other natives of the Dutch Indies. We have
earned from interest on investments, loans etc.,
£j 20,897, and wc have received from dividends from
subsidiary companies for the year 1912, £1,038,215,
making, with the balance brought forward from the
year 1911, a total sum of £1,454,098 3s. 1id....
Taking first the liabilities, the ordinary capital now
amounts to £3,500,000, as against £2,750,000 last
year, and the 30 per cent.. dividend is payable, of
course, on the larger amount. A more remarkable
feature still is that the reserve funds are increased
from £1,120,000/ at which they stood last year, to
the magnificent figure of £3,000,000 sterling.” In
other words, the company’s net profits were
£2.918,215 on a capital of £3,500,000 The shares
in the Shell Transport Co. are held very largely in
Holland; and the Whole group of oil companies,
known to this credulous country as the “British
Imperial,” is largely owned by Chinese and other
Asiatic capitalists. Out of 26 names of chairmen, '
directors, managers and controllers of accounts, only-
seven are obviously British. But when, during 1912,
there was a temporary increase in the importation of
“Shell” spirits into Great Britain, and a corresponding
decrease in the demand for American brands, the
Asiatic Oil Trust represented that their fine old
British product had asserted, once and for all time,
a fine old British supremacy over its foreign rival.
The humor of it!

Victoria’s railways are run for the convenience of
the public, which exists for the convenience of the
Railway Commissioners. Thus louvre trucks, for the
proper conveyance of perishable products, are only
provided on main lines and important branches; the
line that “doesn’t pay axle-grease” has to put up
with the common, tarpaulin-covered conveyance. So,
during the recent hot spell, boxes of butter des-
patched from Elpliinstone weighed the customary
561 b. ; at Castlemaine they scaled about 301 b., and,
by the time the city was reached they had melted
down to 141 b. There was no complaint of a scarcity
of axle-grease on that trip, anyhow ; still, there are
cheaper and better lubricants than butter.
“Marloo”: It takes a genius to get one home on
a gas co., but a man in Honolulu has managed it.
He-had a penny-in-the-slot meter, but, though the
co. was aware that he used a great quantity of gas,
the machine was always empty when the collector
called.' When the co., for its own protection, offered
to pay the rogue for his secret, he produced an ice
disc of. the requisite size, inserted it in the slot, and
let the co. imagine the rest. The staggered insti-
tution decided to open a branch in Greenland, where
ice doesn’t melt quite so fast.

“The Oldest Inhabitant”: A little book, “Steam in
the South Pacific” purports to give the names of all
the early steam vessels. Strange to say, it does not
mention the Phoenix, and in no list of wrecks can
the name be found. Yet that she did exist and trade
in Australian waters is beyond doubt. The following
extract, from the. Illustrated London News of
August 17, 1850, will be read with interest: “Steam-
ers in Australia. —The following extract from a pri-
vate letter- from Sydney indicates an opening for the
profitable employment of some additional steamers
in New South Wales: ‘Within the last few days
the Phoenix steamer has become a wreck in a southerly
gale, about five miles from the Clarence River. She
now lies; stranded on the beach high and dry and;
quite a wreck. The engines may be saved and all
her spars and gear. Thus you see we have lost the
■ only steamer that plied on' that important line, mak-
ing an additional opening for a steamer double the
size and power of the Phoenix, which indeed was
never large enough for the trade. I intend as soon
as I have leisure to get you the particulars of all
the dividends and profits now paid by the Hunter’s
River Company and what the Phoenix was paying.
There is the Port Phillip and Launceston Line now
only about quarter supplied, indeed, from 10 to 12
good steamers equal to the Shamrock, that is about
140 or 150 h.p., and to carry 200 to 300 tons of
cargo, would find ample employment and capital
profits on the various lines now requiring steamers
both fo the North and the South. I wish the public
in London could be made acquainted with our wants
in this respect, for we have no capital here to build
new steamers. Our means of intercourse along the
lines of coast and up our navigable rivers have become
so limited that many parts of the country are now
left in abeyance.’ ” It was a very clumsy and ungram-
matical letter, but it seemed to indicate that a pre-
historic sort of steamer was once Noali’s-Arking in
these waters.
DISILLUSIONED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.
A Bill to prevent married women from obtaining
whisky from grocers, and having it charged on the
grocery account as butter or eggs, has been intro-
duced in the New York State Legislature.
It is stated that the Bill strikes at the real cause
of the high cost of living, as women are habitually
deceiving their husbands in their accounts, making
them pay for whisky entered as edibles.
Madam ! Now ,1 see the reason
Why the cost of living still
Rises in and out of season—
There is whisky in the bill!
Once I trusted you ; nor doubted
The exactness of accounts,..
Though at times mv purse was outed
By increasing large amounts.
Now, alas, my faith is shattered ;
It lias fallen from its pegs.
Nothing, nothing would have mattered
Even beer disguised as eggs ;
But my thoughts I cannot utter
When I think how I get sore
When at breakfast wanting butter
That you drank the night before!
Madame, oh, how could you do it ?
See how doubt must now prevail!
Is this round of beef, and suet,
Brandy, gin, or dinner ale?
When to home at night returning,
With a mind keen set for stews,
l discovered dinner burning,
Was it accident—or booze?
Why the awful; cost of living
■ Still creeps upwards, now I see—
But I still could be forgiving
■Had you shafied the stuff with me!

Lewis Muir, the ragtime merchant, says, “All this
talk about the Tango as a Spanish dance makes me
very tired. It is just nigger ragtime—nothing more.
Fifteen years ago I used to play the piano at a place
which was half dance-hall, half-pub, and the crowd
was none too squeamish. Well, the Tango used to
be there —after the ordinary run of dancers had
gone and the shutters had been officially put up for
the night.” The present Tango is, of course, the
old negroid stuff, purged of 60 per cent, of its
grossness.
Edward Elliott, of the Smart Set entertainers,
claims to have started the Revue in Australia a
year ago, when the S.S.’s were battling at St. Kilda
(Melb.). The collection of local skits which he then
produced, under the title of “Keep To The Right,”
was readapted to local requirements when the little
co. toured Maoriland lately, and has been revised
again for production at Melbourne Athenaeum Hall
this week. The limited resources of the Smart Setters
don’t admit of big spectacular effects, but the Revue
idea is all there, and the one title, “Keep To The
Right,” . has served all the time.
The rush of newspapers to the rescue of perishing
plavs is a recent development in London. The Daily
Mail started it by a public appeal to save that big
spectacular production, “The Miracle,” when it was
on the verge of collapse through public ignorance or
indifference. The energetic campaign of the Daily
Mail saved “The, Miracle,” winch recovered and
enjoyed a long and prosperous run. Other journals
were interested Spectators of this new kind of
“scoop,” and they kept their eyes open for similar
opportunities. The Daily Chronicle is the latest
to pull off a Salvationist victory of the sort. G. It.
Chesterton’s maiden dramatic effort, “Magic,” was
scheduled for sudden withdrawal, owing to the icy
weather in the box-office and the lessee having come
to the end of his financial tether. The Chronicle
came out with an appeal in big type, urging the play-
going public not to allow such a “beautiful work”
to end in this inglorious fashion ; and it kept the
whoop going until, on the Saturday night that was
to have witnessed the final fall of the curtain, the
manager came to the footlights and announced that,
“thanks to the Daily Chronicle” and its “public-
spirited appeal,” sufficient guarantees had been pro-
vided to enable the play to be performed for an in-
rhffinitc period With the characteristic modesty of
the ha’penny press, the Chronicle sums up the result
of its exertions as “one of the most remarkable and
instantaneous reversals of fortune that have ever
occurred in the history of the English stage.”
“G.L.S.”: Mainly to revive a pleasure of 20 years
ago, I floated up to Sydney Royal to see “Diplom-
acy.” The extraordinary attenuation of the house
did not surprise me. Comparisons, of course, are
odious; but one is somewhat appalled when the
almost-perfect cast of over 20 years ago of this little
bit of frippery is brought to mind. ©ld playgoers
will recollect Mrs. Brough as the adventuress, Miss
Grace Noble as Dora, Miss Romer (that queen of
stage old ladies, as The Bulletin once described
her) as the Marquise, and Miss Temple, I think, as
Lady Henry. Of the men, Geo. Tith. as the
Diplomatist, Brough as Orloff, Boucicault as Stein,
and Cecil Ward, the young lover, are most prominent
in one’s memory. On second thoughts, that seems
just about to complete the cast. This old, refined,
melodramatic, comedic absurdity was hailed with
delight—probably from the perfection of its produc-
tion 20 years ago. Now we have, at last, an oppor-
tunity of seeing it produced by Mr. Julius Knight.
The best work is done by Mrs. Brough, Miss Temple
(they would have done well to have exchanged
places) and Miss Lizette Parkes. The stage reputa-
tion of all these ladies has been made in Australia.
An announcement is made, per programme, that Mr.
Julius Knight (in big black letters) will produce “A
Royal Divorce,” supported by Miss Irene Brown (in
letters quite as big and quite as black), as the
Empress Marie Louise. The strong and important
part of the piece (unless it is “produced” too much
bv Mr. Julius Knight) is the Empress Josephine, and
this is to be played (now for your very small let-
ters) by Miss Irby Marshall. She is capable and
charming; but, alas! she is another Australian.
“Thornell” : The twice .nightly system is spreading
in England. For a long time it has been in vogue
in vaudeville houses; now the legitimate theatres are
adopting the system, and applying it not only to
pantomime, but to such things as ‘‘The Girl Who
Took the Wrong Turning,” and “Buried to the
Wrong Man.” Which is hard lines on the girl.
Meetings are being held by members of the profes-
sion to protest against the extra work, as it offers
no pecuniary gain to the actor. Will we get it
here? Is is already creeping into vaudeville; the
Brennan-Fullers’ management is re-opening the Bijou
in Melbourne with performances at seven and nine
o'clock each night.
The Asches have leased a London theatre for a
revival of “Kismet,” and talk of building a theatre
where they will start proceedings with “Antony and
Cleopatra,” or a new play which will introduce Oscar
and Lily as a Zulu chief and his best colored girl.
The chance of “Kismet” picking up its London
success where it dropped it (two years ago) looks very
risky. The attraction of the drama was its novelty.
Inveterate playgoers spoke of it as something differ-
ent from ordinary spectacular dramas of its class.
But they will not talk of it again, nor will the
people who missed seeing “Kismet” at first be very
keen on seeing the revival. A novelty has only one
great innings, and “Kismet” was a novelty quite
devoid of solid human interest. Nobody believed in
the story of the dirty, brutal nigger, the vizier, the
caliph, the large beggar’s daughter, and the subor-
dinate beggar who tried to annex the bigger mendi-
cant’s pitch.
“Stargazer”: “Joseph and His Brethren” is con-
ventional melodrama with more whiskers. I do not
remember to have seen such large quantities of
whiskers on any stage in all my 30 years of theatri-
cal experience. It would cost £157 14s. 6d. to hair-
cut and shave the full strength of the company, and
the individual hairs of the whiskers of Joe’s rela-
tions, if strung together, would reach from Geelong
to Cloncurry. In spite of its hairiness, the Biblical
drama is as heavy as the whole output of Broken
Hill for 20 years past. Here and there a fat man is
thrown in to relieve the religious solemnity, but he
fails every time. By the way, have you noticed that
in plays of this holy sort the effort to get a little
light relief is always per medium of something fat,
something suggestive of extreme unction? Shorn
of its hair and whiskers, and dressed in modern
clobber, “Joseph and His Brethren” would be quite
at home at the King’s Theatre under the title of
“The Worst Sphinx in Egypt.”
“The Oldest Inhabitant”; Apropos old dramatic
clubs in Melbourne (B. 2G/2/’ 14). ' Neither Fox nor
Philp belonged to the Histrionic Club. Both were
Garrick men. Fox was one-time railway station-
master for the Hobson’s Bay Co., and afterwards a
barrister’s clerk. Philp was a draughtsman. The
Press Club performed only once—for the G. V. Brooke
Memorial. The Tradesmen’s Club used to give per-
formances at the National Hall, in Fitzroy. There
was no regular club at the old Prince of Wales house;
but a number of youthful amateurs there performed
“Ilofer, the Tell of the Tyrol.” Finnamore, Hod-
son (real name Bulman), Manseragh and Metcalfe
(real name Hudspeth) were of the Garrick Club in its
later years, Finnamore wrote two tragedies which
were played and printed, “Francesca Vasari” and
“Carpio.” Even Dr. Neild spoke well of them.
Jevern, Mick Maloney and Campbell were Garrick
men. There was another club, the A.8.C., which
erected the memorial over the grave of Ellen Mortyn
in the Melb. General Cemetery. Mick Maloney and
a party gave a performance of “The Honeymoon,”
which so pleased Barry Sullivan that he offered Mick
an engagement. A great amateur performance was
that of “The Poor Gentleman,” given for the benefit
of G. V. Brooke. The cast included 11. J. Chambers,
solicitor ; Jas. Smith, the journalist.; John Hayward,
retired actor ; Fox ; Wilson, scene artist; Ebenezer Ward,
afterwards a South Australian of note; and James
Weedon, a city councillor. “The Merchant of Venice”
had the advantage of George Coppin as Launcelot
Gobbo, and Morton King, then in political life, as
Shylock. This writer was not in that performance,
but he played with several of those named.

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

IS!
The Royal Commission
in their final report on Tuberculosis,
recently issued, clearly showed that
the chief danger to child life resulted
from'the use of infected cow’s milk.
To quote one extract : “The'Evi-
dence we have accumulated goes to
demonstrate that a considerable
amount of the tuberculosis of child-
hood is to be ascribed to infection
transmitted to children in meals
consisting largely of the milk of
-the cow.”
When the mother’s milk is not
available, the “Allenburys” Foods
form the best substitute, as they are
practically identical with healthy human milk
in composition, nutritive value and digestibility,
and are absolutely free from all harmful germs.
Milk Food No. I. From birth to 3 months
Milk Food No. 2. From 3to 6 months
Malted Food No. 3. From 6 months upwards
The Allenburys* Rusks. A
valuable addition to baby’s dietary
when ten months old and after These
Kusks are specially useful during the
troublesome time of teething. When
eaten raw they mechanically aid the
cutting of teeth.
Foods
promote sound sleep, ensure
vigorous health and develop-
ment, and represent the most
successful method of Infant
Feeding ever devised.

WHAT IS
Golcryst is made from Epsom Salts,
Senna, Sarsaparilla, Dandelion, Liq-
uorice and Ginger. That seems a
good' combination of useful medi-
cines for Constipation, Rheumatism,
Impure Blood, Pimples, Boils,
Stomach and Liver Troubles.
So popular has this remedy become in
Australia that Golcryst may be regarded
as the National Aperient.

THIS FORMULA REALLY MAKES
HAIR GROW.
Some time ago I read in a paper a for-
mula for a preparation which was claimed
- to destroy the dandruff germ and to strongly
stimulate the hair growth. In spite of the
fact that I had already tried many prepara-
, tions without benefit, and my hair was thin
and falling out very fast, I decided to give
the formula a trial. Accordingly I got my
chemist to put.up 3 ounces of Bay Bum, 1
ounce' of Lavona de Composee, and \ dram
of Menthol Crystals, and applied it regu-
larly every morning and night, rubbing
carefully into the scalp with the finger tips.
Much to my delight and astonishment the
intolerable itching ceased with the first
application, the dandruff disappeared, the
falling out of the hair stopped completely,
and 'by the time . I had used four bottles I
had a finer, longer and more luxuriant
-growth of hair than I ever had before. I
have since recommended this formula ' to
many of my friends with equally wonderful
results. I understand that this formula
cgn be prepared by all chemists and drug-
gists. and I strongly advise all who have
not yet given it a trial to do so immediately.

There is vague talk of the British suffra-
gettes holding a nublic conflagration of the
Scripture as a protest. The Scripture was
written by men, and all through it woman
is represented in a humble and subject
capacity. She is even forbidden to speak in
church, and is commanded to wear her hat
during service, and ordered to be subservient
to her husband. And her right to the posses-
sion of a man, all to herself, was so vague
that one apostle urged bishops not to commit
bigamy. The really militant and embattled 1
suffragette is greatly tempted to burn Holy~
Writ and throw the cinders at a male arch-
bishop.

IN
BANANA LAND
Treasurer Barnes on the failure of big
business houses to comply with registration
law: “I should be loth to take action against
reputable firms.” “Reputable firms” means
concerns in a big wav. Why more “loth” to
deal with an expansive law-breaker than
with one weighing 6st. ? It sounds like the
argument of the timorous policeman.
In the dark ages of just 50 years ago the
foundation-stone of the Brisbane Town Hall
was laid, and a copper plate was let into it
affirming that “This building is erected by
the unaided efforts of the Municipality of
Brisbane.” Unaided efforts! What un-
speakable barbarism to brazenly set about
building a place without borrowing the
money!
“Jonfa’s” Howl:—
The most villainously sweated Queensland charac-
ter, over what one might term a short distance, is
the State Electoral Returning-Officer, lie is usually
someone who can’t very well decline the hard labor
of being a returning officer —a schoolmaster, or police-
magistrate, or land-commissioner. So when he gets a
notice from the Home-Secretary’s Department, sav-
ing “The Governor jn Council has been pleased to
appoint you to the position of Returning Officer for
the, etc., etc.,” he just sighs deeply, and writes
back that he has no kick coming, or words to that
effect.
Take, as a sample of his duties, the by-election
for Normanby (Central Queensland), the. late George
Fox’s pocket borough. Date of nomination, February
14 : polling day, March 5. The returning-offieer’s job
starts at least a fortnight before nomination, and
ends a fortnight after polling day. There are 76
polling places to be attended to." The R.O. has,
therefore, to appoint' 76 presiding officers, besides a
similar number of poll-clerks. He has to post them
up in their duties ; supply them -with the necessary
materia] (ballot-boxes, papers, forms, etc.) ; answer
correspondence with the Department and his own
officials; send out postal-ballot papers to any who
apply for them; and keep his 76 copies of the rolls
posted up to date. This, in an electorate which com-
prises hundreds of square miles, and where, in many
cases, the ballot-boxes have to be conveyed by special
messengers over bush tracks, is a tidy job in itself.
When the polling is ever, the returning-officer has
to collect all ballot-papers, check the results, make
, out his returns, etc., and forward them all ft> Bris-
bane. In this work he is watched by scrutineers, wht>
ape liable to be bush-lawyers of the testiest and
.most point-taking description. And the pay for the
whole nerve-racking, laborious seven weeks’ job is a
tenner —less than 30 bob a week. Would someone
oblige by starting an agitation to provide Wages
Hoards for the returning-officers of Bananaland ? They
peed them badly.
“Fighting Parson” Sams, from outback of
Charters Towers, has been awarded the gold
badge of the North Queensland Amateur
Athletic Association, which signifies life
membership. It is a rare award, the only
other who has yet received it being the first

ing Australia, but finds it hard work to pack
his few duds.
Hunter, M.L.A., may yet worry the Gov-
ernment into resuming the available parts of
Mount Hutton, Myall Downs, Euthulla, Kil-
morey and two or three smaller holdings
within handy distance of Roma, and exercis-
ing its rights under the Act of 1910 to
resume the'balance of the leases. In this
one patch of State land there are over
800,000 acres, mostly agricultural, and, with
a cheap, 30-mile line from Roma, Hunter
believes the biggest thing in agricultural
settlement yet attempted by Queensland
could be carried through. So far, certainly,
the Government has done nothing definite, it
being much the easiest policy to leave the
big landlord alone and send the little-man
applicant on. to a slice of pear country, where
he may grow old in clearing it for his grand-
children.
COURTEOUS RUT DISCONCERTING.
OLD GENT (blandly): “ Excuse me, sir. If you want to know the time, might I suggest
that you ask a policeman? My old chronometer is thoroughly unreliable. It is one

“Dido”: Consider the case of Cairns. In
one week a Chinaman was fined £5O for
being in possession of opium, while another
was denuded of £2O for selling opium to an
aboriginal. Two more who toed the mark
brought £lO each for having sold morphia to
Boori and Binglii. Then, to top off, as it
were, 14 gentlemen with yellow names were
fined £l5 each for selling pak-a-pu to
the’ gentle passers-by. Will Bruce Smith
hereabouts oblige with a songandance?
“Tom Noddy” : Melbourne chemist Camp-
bell has concluded a series of analyses to
find if prickly pear possesses any qualities
of commercial value. He found that its main
constituent is 90 per cent, of water, the
balance being small amounts of acetic acid,
ammonia, charcoal and crude tar. Alto-
gether the value of the products from one
ton of the green plant is about Bs. Never
before did I fully realise the devastating and
prickly character of water.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.
It was all right in the wooded places
No matter how thick the jungle grew,
Little heath flowers with white-lipped faces
Broke from the green to nod to you,
And the wattle gold was in many places,
Flinging bonnets against the blue.
// we had stayed in the wooded places,
Shut out the world with a leafy screen,
Wooed the fern in its golden graces,
Trod the mosses that lay between,
Bound the hours with blossoming traces.
Stalled Content where the brown boles
lean—
But a wind came singing of moonlit reaches.
Deep sea hollows and billows free.
Black rocks built on the soft, white beaches,
Mermaids holding a revelry—
The wind came singing of moonlit reaches
The green boughs parted to show the sea !
And the sea said: “Thus at the last, I claim
you !
Did you think you could well forget?
I send my breath on the wind to shame you ;
Leaf-bound heart, you remember yet!
Though the forest quiver in storm to blame
you,
I have sworn you shall not forget!
“You were spawn of the mighty oceans!
Leave the tree-time to those who care.
I was the spring of your youth’s emotions —■
A dancing barque and a seaway fair!—
Your blood remembers the troth of oceans
And I call to the son I bare!”
It was all right in the wooded places,
Sky shut off by a spreading tree,
Budding vines with their curving graces,
Birds in a low-toned minstrelsy;
It was all right in the wooded places,
But the green boughs parted to show the
sea !
Now the waves leap ’neath me, as steed
’neath master!
Now the sun sinks red in a shoreless sweep,
And the tide flows swift, and the wind beats
faster.
And the shallows mock at the roaring deep :
Do the dead leaves sigh where they flutter
past her.
Do the flowers droop when they hear her
weep ?
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, March 7, 1914.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
His Ex. has not been prominently before
the public this week, owing to a temporary
slump in country shows. However, he has
announced his intention of visiting Too-
woomba for Carnival week next month,
when, with Lady Macgregor and suite, he
will be the guest of the Jim Taylors at
Clifford House. After the Toowoomba fes-
tivities Sir William will be occupied with
affairs in the central district, and will not
return to town until towards the end of
May.
Yesterday being Lady Macgregor’s birth-
day, -she decided, to give a treat to the chil-
dren of the Blind, Deaf and Dumb Institu-
tion. The treat took the form of a river
picnic on board the Gov. steam yacht
Lucinda. The hostess, assisted by his Ex.,
Miss Macgregor and the small Paget child,
received the guests at the gangway. The
wharf was left (as a memento of the occa-
sion) shortly after two o’clock, and full
steam made for Lytton, where the boat
anchored for the serious business of after-
noon tea. Each little guest received a gift
from Lady Macgregor.
On Tuesday night the metnbers of the
Brisbane Club gave an At Home in honor
of the President of the club and Mrs, Coakes,
at the Exhibition gardens. Stately palms,
banks of green fern, and masses of gay
flowers, thrown into relief by the brilliant
illuminations, formed a delightful setting for
the. rainbow-tinted gowns of the women. A
regimental band interpolated music and
accompanied an excellent supper to ragtime.
A streak of mystery and imagination was
supplied in the presence of a crystal gazer.
Altogether, the affair was voted a pro-
digious success.
The engagement is announced of Celina,
second daughter of the Duncan Munros, of
Headington, Toowoomba, to D. J. Nelson,
son of the late Premier Nelson, of Gabbin-
bar. Toowoomba. The weddinsr will take
place after Easter.
Another engagement not yet announced is
that of a young society widow to a stal-
wart professional man from bony Scotland.
Mrs. Sidney Cook, of Dulwich Hill. Syd-
ney, is on a visit to her people, the Robin-
sons, of Toowoomba. Her husband. Dr.
Cook, is a son of the late Samuel Cook, one
time G.M. of Sydney Morning Herald.
Frankfort, the home of the Cook family at
Marrickville, was sold some time ago, and
now does duty as a Salvation Army institu-
tion.
Mrs. C. Marsden, of your town, is stay-
ing with the Roy Kings, who have leased
the beautiful home of the J. E. Trudes at
New Farm during the absence of Mrs. Trude
in Stanthorpe.
Miss Whelan, of Sydney, who has been
visiting Mrs. Arthur Morgan, shook the
North from her shoes and departed by the
Osterley on Tuesday. Dentist Miss Martha
Burns also left by the same boat on a trip
to the Cold Country.
Mrs. Geo. Raff and her daughter, Mrs.
Stuart Ilyslop, are spending a holiday at
Sydney. As Pearlie Molle, Mrs. Hyslop
was a few years ago the beauty of Queens-
land. The Maorilander she married died a
couple of years back.
A country wedding was celebrated at.
Laidley some days ago, when Elvie Overell.
eldest daughter of Mr. and Mrs. ,T. E. Over-
ell, was married to G. W. Wallace, Q. N.
Bank, Hadep’. The bride, who wore a beau-
tiful gown of white satin with overdress of
ninon, had cousins Myrtle and Doreen Over-
ell as bridesmaids. The former was gowned
in champagne satin, with tunic of ninon.
and topped 'off with a becoming picture hat
of black velvet. Sister Doreen was in ivory
crepe de Chine, with hat en suite (that’s
French, I think, Thargomindah), touched
with pink.
Another wedding that may be of interest
to you was that of Miss Mary Charles,
daughter of Mrs. Charles, Middle Park, Mel-
bourne, to Horace Saflham, of Downs Park,
Tara, Queensland, and son of Mrs. W. San-
ham, St. Kilda, Melbourne. The contract
was carried out at the ;Ann-street Presby-
terian wedding factory, Brisbane, the bride
celebrating the operation in a graceful gown
of rich satin beautified with Iloni-
ton lace. Dollie Gray (no relation of the
girl immortalised in song) undertook the
duties of bridesmaid, which she performed in
a girlish white frock, with hat more or less
similar.
On. Tuesday Mrs. Edgar Walker gave
a farewell At Home in honor of daughter
Irene, who is leaving for England this week.
On Wednesday Miss Walker was the guest
of honor at a solemn tea in St. John’s school-
room, when, as a mark of appreciation of
her honorary services to the Corresponding
Board of Missions, she was presented with
a travelling bag. The clergy of Brisbane
mustered strongly at the gathering and made
the sprinkling of laity look worth about
2 jd. ;•
Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Hobbs returned,
from the North on Thursday. The illness-,
of their son “Bartie,” a handsome stripling;
of 17, who is jackerooing on a station, was:
the incentive for travel. Mrs. Hobbs, who-
was one of the Murray-Prior girls, a family-
noted for its fair women, is being congratu-
lated upon her son’s recovery. Appendicitis;
was the trouble, and at one time the Pearly-
Gates were within coo-ee.
Mrs. J. J. Kingsbury, President of the
National Council of Women, and one of our
best women speakers,, will leave shortly for
Rome, where she will represent Queensland!
at the International Council of Women. Oni
Thursday night she was farewelled at the
Albert Hall by her colleagues and friends-
The guest of the evening was gowned in ai
handsome black toilette.
At “The Dandies” last night an exhibi-
tion of ballroom Tango attracted a crowded
house. As performed by Miss Henderson
and partner, the saraband lias a total absence
of vulgarity or suggestiveness. Those who
came to scoff remained to applaud, probably
to cover their disappointment.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
The chief feature of interest in connec-
tion with Bananaland’s Railway Jubilee
was Minister Paget’s announcement that
the State had no vacancies for the imported
article and that the policy of training their
own men to fill everv post would be con-
tinued. At which scores of budding Railway
Commissioners signified their joy in the
usual manner.

handbag or trunk, without fear of leakage; with the “ladder”
feed, erratic working is out of the question; the nib is the
product of over 60 years’ experience; the holder is beautifully
balanced and holds a good supply of ink.

AUSTRALIANS
IN LONDON
will be glad to know of the numerous
amenities and pleasant sides of hotel
life presented by the Hotel Russell.
The visitor feels more like coming
into the atmosphere of English home-
life at its best than entering an hotel.
c There is that domesticity of service
and general environment that make for supreme comfort and homeli-
ness. The cooking is faultless ; the style and scheme of furnishing
luxurious but restrained ; the tariff modest.
c At the Centre of London’s throbbing life,
it is yet peaceful and quiet, overlooking the
park-like Russell Square. A penny ’bus fare
from almost any spot of interest in London.

Hunyadi Janos
The prime recommendation of Hunyadi Janos Natural
Aperient Water is that it far surpasses manufactured
aperients as a remedy for Constipation, Biliousness, Indi-
gestion, Hemorrhoids, Torpid Liver, etc. It is bottled
at the springs, just as Nature creates it, without the addition
of any other constituent.
All chemists sell Hunyadi Janos. Get a bottle to-day.

Name and address must appear on MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submittedj and no MSS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
R.T.: You must be laboring under a mis-
take of some sort. This paper never objected to
Sydney, or Melbourne either, though it has done its
best to uphold the interests of those sections of
N.S.W. which are not Sydney and those parts of
Victoria which are not Melbourne. And it seems
to be playing almost a lone hand on that job so
far as the city press is concerned... .J.M.S.: A
featherweight rhyme. Try to do something with a
hunk of beef in it. This is the meat-strike time,
and the bard’s soul lightly turns to thoughts of ox.
. ...G.A.. “Courting” is a very ordinary statement
of a very ordinary grievance. Every youth is a sub-
ject of mirth to some girl. The dashing creature
who turned this writer down with unutterable scorn
in the long ago was taking in washing when he last
heard of her. Cleopatra was a wise woman. Alter
a life of pride and pomp and sin and derision, she
saw the wash-tub ahead, so she committed suicide.
.... F. Jassy: One is dirt and the other two are
rubbish. .. .Stelle: It was such a bright footnote
that we forgave you for sending an old yarn and
wanted to hear from you again D.W.M.: 1 nat
director put it badly; but his figures were quite
right and in accordance with the analysis in is.
29/5/’l3. The eo. has paid in the last three years
dividends of 20, 10 and 10 p.c. respectively. .Bene-
rembah: Not so far as we can learn. Darlinghurst
(Sydney) has been the venue of all such ceremonies
for years past. . . .Sconeite: You are much too verbose.
If we had accused your friend of something really
discreditable, you couldn’t have put up a wordier
defence R.A. (Balclutha) ; Letter posted as re-
quested Broad Arrow: Yes; The Bulletin christ-
ened it so G.P.8.H.: We have “kindly considered
it,” as requested; but it was a struggle. .. .
Geo. Vaughan: A story that is simply a burst of mad-
ness should never exceed two columns. When tangled
lunacy reaches four columns it becomes a weariness.
.F.O. (Sydney) ; Sorry “Dreamer” unsuitable. . . .
Battler: In future get your rough manuscript either
typed or buijiit. . . .A.F.11. (Burnie, Tas.) : Itegiet
unable to use.'.matter W. 11. Mac.: Its a babble-
some thing tjiat about Horace and Gertie. . . .John
R. : Poem haslnud on its boots and walks slowly. ...
Greenweeds: You are a young woman and probably
beautiful. Wliy, then, ink your fingers writing poems
about dashing' o’er the plain on your steed, with
your bleating pet lamb clasped to your bosom r
Believe us, the world doesn’t appreciate such beauti-
ful and becoming sentiments.... Glad Eye: The last
rhyme stumbles along in a metre that should be
tripped lightly. .. .Roy S. II.: If the hair is m the
soup again, let it stay there. Don’t transfer it to
the inkbottle W.G.D.: Chewing rhyme is a poor,
foolish product. . . .Charles A.. Have read your
patriotic song. Poor Australia!... .Perth S.: It is
a mistake for the average gentle female to sing
about the beat of the drum. It is a mistake for her
to sing about anything. ... Uncle: No, Uncle, not
even if you threatened to throttle u 5.... Mick M.:
Unsuitable W J. 0.: Not Bulletin stuff
S. : Like boarding-house soup during the meat-
strike—thin. .. . Ecnirp. One is just stately stodge.
Rhvmbel is poorly adapted to topic. .. .Alpha & 0.:
Aviation article too late and much too heavy. It
won’t fly in print... .L.V.: Not worth ink....J.R.:
Get back to the surf ; don’t waste time writing about
it... . Yaller Dog: Who the Devil untied y0u?....
Pete: Rhyme shambles along happily, but can’t reach
the “Abo.” column, where the bush poems smoke ami-
ably together. .. ,H. 8.: Obviously a knickerbocker
poem written by a solemn small boy with a good
religious upbringing. .. .Mary .E. G.: Very prosy
verse. .. .M.8.K.: Sincere work, but sentiment con-
ventional and treatment nothing to cheer about....
A. McC,: Can’t bring back that day....G.G.. The
man who rashly offered to insure Australia against
invasion or that full feeling after meals was attended
to in last issue. You don’t get a good metrical grip
on your subject. .. .A.M. (Homebush) : Dialogue not
absorbing. . . .Albert G. F.: If you really did that all
by yourself, you ought to be dead. If you will
call round at'this office any Wednesday (Wednesday
is our stand-easy day), we will make you dead. You
will probably be happier that way.... Sarah: If
they weren’t uprooting the wood blocks across the
street, and if the fire-engines didn’t go past so fre-
quently, your poems about the dying of the year
might seem more musical. Some day the office in-
tends to buy a tall, snow-clad mountain garmented
in silence for the man who has to judge the repose-
ful poems. You had better hold on until then....
Riah: Charity off E.B.R. (Vic.): It’s hardly a
story at all. We would describe it as a discreetly
rapturous outburst over the concussion of two con-
vention-defying lovers. And that’s a very old theme.
.. , .F.G.S.X.: Sometimes we wish we were dead, and
sometimes we wish we had never been born. You
make us feel even worse than that. We could only
express our opinion of your poem with two blue
lights, such as are used for signalling a. vessel in
distress, and nine Chinese stinkpots. .. .Bayside: How
cleverly you avoid saying anything!
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
Henry C.: You overwork that broken line. The
two loafers look as if they had been constructed of
scraps of wire-netting. . . .A.W.: Two at least of your
gags are old and the drawings are patchy.... Phil
M.: Feeble attempt at a jest and the drawing is
very wooden.... E.W.: It isn’t a very good drawing,
and we are not sufficiently interested. .. .H.G.: Re-
turning two... .A.J.: The elderly clergyman wears
a look of speechless dismay—and no elderly clergy-
man who had been cheeked would be at a loss for
words or gaze wildly at the floor. Then why does
his Bible or prayer-book look like an empty cigar-
case? Perhaps it is an empty cigar-case? Did you
ever see a clergyman examine a Scripture history
class with an empty cigar-case.... Jerry: It isn’t
like the politician. Then the arms are withered and
the garden grass seems to be made of wire....
F. McK.: Your horses are like horses, but the
human figures and their clothes are all out. The
weak, old pun attached was pensioned off many
years ago. .. .R.S. (Vic.): A respectable drawing,
but you are unfortunate in your choice of a topic.
There seems to be uncertainty now about General
Villa’s character. At first, he was represented as a
sort of bloodstained lunatic —the sort of lunatic the
Boer commanders were supposed to be when the
South African war was young. Last article writer struck
described Villa as a much-respected despot with con-
siderable administrative ability. Must refrain from
picturing him as a cowardly and irresponsible
assassin until the first excitement over Englishman
Benton’s death wears off and the correspondents have
got the Mexican’s character properly focussed. At
present, he is an impossible cross between a fiend and
a business man with a gun. . . .C.E.D.: The cocky
and his hired wretch are crude libels on the human
form. Horses in background are much better. Coun-
try artists seem to observe the horse much better
than the man or his clothes.... Rupert E.: Grandpa
is singularly calm, considering that he is sitting on
the ruins of an egg. You haven’t drawn or suggested
the ruins, and his gnome-like grandchild may be a
liar. He looks like a liar.
“Gerrardio” : The Children of Israel who
were in camp lately at Lilyddle—-the one
lan Hamilton inspected—had their scruples
so far studied that kosher rations were made
available at a special kosher kitchen in the
49th Infantry lines. It’s to be hoped the
commissariat will always run to kosher
meat and passover cake. Scores of the
Semitic faith commandeered pork from the
Boer farms in S’Africa. and calling it veldt-
venison, chewed it ravenously when rations
were short under General Bundle after Win-
burg.

WOLF
Patent
Superheated
STEAM LOCOMOBILE
THE LAST WORD
IN
MODERN SUPERHEATED STEAM ENGINE CONSTRUCTION.
In regard to durability, reliability, steady running
and adaptability, Wolf Superheated Steam Locomo-
biles at least equal the best steam engine or turbine
plants of several ICOO-h.p.
Their superiority in economy is attained by their
faultless construction, and in obviating the many
losses, including radiation, etc., which are unavoid-
able in steam plants having separate boiler and
engine.
Over Suction Gas Plants, Oil and Gas Engines, Wolf
Locomobiles possess the following advantages
Cheaper cost of fuel; great reserve of power, allow-
ing overloads up to 50 per cent.; steadiness in run-
ning under extreme and sudden variation of load; use
of any kind of fuel besides coal; utilisation of steam
for heating or manufatturing purposes; easy attend-
ance, even by unskilled hands; Absolute Reliability
and Greater Durability; greater simplicity and con-
tinuously maintained economy also at lower loads.

of taking the wholesale catalogues of the

was of a revolutionary character, and
might have landed us in heavy loss, but
IT DID NOT,

EXPERIMENT.
If you would like to see the alteration Grey Hairs
make, just lay a piece of paper over each of the two
halves of the above portrait. The Grey “half” will
then be seen to have the appearance of 45 years of
age, whereas the other half looks only 30. Dr. B.
Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut Stain will make
all those years of difference if you are grey or prema-
turely grey. It is perfectly harmless, easy to apply,
and will quickly restore the Hair to the natural shade
of youth, or younger years.
Dr. B. ALLEN’S ,u.s.a.,
Mexican WALNUT STAIN
is offered as a Superior Stain. It contains no lead,
mercury, silver, sulphur, etc., and is equally suitable
for Ladies’ Hair, or Hair of the Beard or Moustache.

The Inky Way
“He took up an evening paper and began to cut
the leaves.” Thus a London lady-novelist, and the
papers of the little village have been poking fun at
her in consequence. No morning or evening paper
now conies out with uncut leaves, and there are
only two weeklies that do so, Notes and Queries
and the London Gazette. The former is the small-
est-paged paper in London; the latter is a dull,
stodgv weekly organ of the Imperial Government,
and as nobody reads it nobody knows whether its
leaves are cut or not. Until recently, the Athenaeum
and Spectator did not bother about cutting their
leaves, but now they are more careful about their
toilet.

at one meal eaten no less than three “esteemed con-
temporaries” — Madame, the Throne and the On-
looker. Madame, the senior of the defunct trinity,
had a run of 15 years. It was started by a German
named Reichardt, who had scored some success with
Pick-Me-Up, and thought he would take in feminine
journalism and write about skirts and frills. The
Onlooker was the offspring of a Society lady, Mrs.
Williamson, and specialised in “smart” gossip with
pictures. The Throne was a very ambitious venture,
founded eight years ago by Lord Armstrong, of the
big gun-making firm. It was printed on the finest
paper in the most beautiful style, and its staff of
contributors was drawn largely from the House of
Lords. Advertisements were disdained. Lord Arm-
strong dropped thousands in trying to keep its head
above water, A very dreary head it was, and when
at last the dead thing turned upside down and only
its feet appeared above the surface, nobody objected
much.

“J.F.H.” (from London): Dropped out, the
Weekly Budget, an attempt of the American journal-
istic colossus, W. R. Hearst, to inflict upon J. Bull
and his missus one of the huge Sunday papers, with
a gaudy-colored “comic supplement,” that New
York seems to like, but for which London has no
use. Somehow Yankee notions in journalism and
the drama are poor goods for export purposes. The
big modern, dramatic successes in the States have
mostly been tragic failures in London. The latest
case in point is “The Poor Little Rich Girl,” a play
of the sort that Americans love, full of sloppy senti-
mentality and domestic bathos. In spite of much
preliminary puffing it was such a frost in London
that it was summarily hustled off after a few per-
formances to papered houses.
The Triad, a magazine which serves Maoriland
with a monthly helping of art, literature and odds
and ends, has decided to establish itself at Sydney
and spread the beam of its effulgence upon the
Australian. But not upon the Great Australian
Bloke. He is to be left wallowing in the gloom.
“During the first 12 months,” writes the editor
(C. N. Baeyertz), “I am going to send a copy of
The Triad free to every householder above the
status of a laborer in every Australian State.”
That will account for 30,000 copies, according to
the estimate, so the rest of the population is left to
gnash its hobnails in outer darkness. Australia’s old
friend, Frank Morton, will continue to stand by
Baeyertz at the wheel when it starts revolving in
Sydney.

There is nothing furiously up to date about the
Sydney Newsletter. Thus, in a very recent issue, it
quoted “the Melbourne Argus of the 16th March”
as its authority for a three-quarter column article on
“the affairs of the fifth Marquis of Anglesey, who
died this week.” He died in 1905. Another par.
went this way :
“Lord Charles Beresford, who will not take over
the command of the Mediterranean Fleet until next
June, bade farewell to his flagship’s crew while the
Caesar was in the Bay of Biscay.”
It is nearly nine years since Beresford took over
the Mediterranean Fleet, and he had been a naval
back-number long, long before his enemy, Percy Scott,
laid it down that he had never been a real sailor in
his life.

A feature of the Methodist Conference lately held
in Sydney was the appearance on the platform of
John Gale, the oldest working pressman in the State.
Mr. Gale, who is 83, has been for half a century
connected with the Queanbeyan Age —originally the
Golden Age. At one time he represented the Mur-
rumbidgee in the Leg. Ass. He is reputed to be
the last survivor of the first Methodist Confernce
held in 1855.
“Monkbarns”: The original members of the Mel-
bourne Yorick Club, in 1868, included Marcus Clarke,
Rev. J. J. Bleasdale (familiarly known as Father
Blazes, a connoisseur in wines arid gems), Charley
Bright, Coroner Candler, Carrington, barrister Dobson,
astronomer Ellery, engineer Elsdon, Gowen Evans,
Eville, Geary, editor Haddon of the Argus, Profes-
sors Hearn and Irving, J. G. Knight, G. C. Levey,
Byron Moore, Dr. Neild, Cosmo Newbery, O’Hea, G.
W. Rusden, geologist Selwyn, Shillinglaw, H. J.
Smith, James Smith, Jardine Smith, Stiffe, Telo,
Venables, architect Wardell, Walstab, Wheeler, Wil-
loughby and Wvatt. As an intellectual galaxy it has
waned ever since. The respectable concatenation
grew out of svmposiums at Haddon’s lodging in
Spring-street. He and Clarke went to batch with
dentist Bowen, in Collins-street, where there was not
room for the symposium. The coterie was kept alive
bv Marcus Clarke, Gordon the poet, and others at
Nissen’s Cafe, Bourke-street. Kendall also came in.
Clarke proposed a regular club, with its own room.
Agreed, and under a lamp-post the members of a
search committee were appointed. They decided on
an upper chamber next the Argus. Clarke wanted
the members to sit on kerosene tins, smoke church-
wardens, and drink only beer out of pewters. How-
ever. bundles of newspapers were used to sit on.
Mueller kept the hotel next door, and furnished the
funds for preliminary exes. Now about the name.
Clarke, as chief nanjandrum, fetched in a skull, given
bv Dr. Pat Moloney, and used by Montgomery in
“Hamlet.” This grim object was stuck on the
mantelniece, with a churchwarden pipe in its mouth.
Then Clarke demanded that the club should be named
the Golgotha. This was supported by Kendall and
Gordon. Others proposed “Bohemian,” “Savage,”
“Nomads,” “Flatheads,” “Rovers,” “Beefsteak,”
“Night Owls,” etc. “Yorick” was a compromise.
But Clarke was huffy, and stayed away for several
days. Clarke and Telo had rooms together over a
Coll ins-street sewing-machine shop. Here and at the
Yorick most of “His Natural Life” was written.
Gordon was a good deal there. Actor Montgomery
also came frequentlv. Jardine Smith, the journalist,
had a beautiful countenance. Clarke proposed tc
tour with a miracle play—Smith as Christ, and Telo
as Judas. Whereupon a friend wanted to put in
-Tames Smith, the critic, as Mephistooheles. A mem-
ber of the Yorick solemnly produced a skull of the
Australian lion, Thylacoleo carnifex. Whether he
imposed on the club does not exactly appear, but the
skull was sent to Professor McCov, who laconically
said, “Sheep’s head—like yours.” Clarke was the
first secretary. Yet he, Walstab, and other cronies
afterwards left the club, and tried to spoil it with
roaring assemblages in Mueller’s. Kane followed
Clarke as secretary, and a new pen-nib must be fixed
for the next one—Chief Justice Madden! This was
somewhere about the time he applied in vain for the
poor billet of University Librarian.
Maoriland has a home-grown aviator. J.
W. H. Scotland, who the other day Hew
from Invercargill to Gore, 41 miles inland,
in 33 minutes —an average of nearly SU
miles an hour. Scotland is a Maoriland
boy, 22 years old, who last year was bitten
by the flying microbe. His people having
plenty of cash, he was sent to Fogland to
learn to spread his wings. He learnt to
fly in two days and gave a lot of exhibi-
tions on the Caudron machine in Bull s
land. He is now back in Maoriland with a
local syndicate behind him, and with an
idea in his head to fly from tewn to town,
and give exhibitions at the roosting-places.

Eczema
to run on
unchecked
Eczema, the most common of all skin diseases, is easily
amenable to treatment, and should never be allowed to run
on unchecked. If intelligently treated in the beginning,
Eczema can be readily kept at bay, but if allowed to run on indefinitely it will
grow worse year by year until finally it becomes a trial exceptionally hard to
bear.
Eczema has a strong tendency to become chronic, and the dreadful sufferings
that so many endure, from the irritation and itching, has caused many a sufferer
MISS
GRACE
STOWE
(from a

u
days of irritability and nights of sleep-
lessness. Rexona is undoubtedly the most
successful remedy to check, control and eradi-
cate Eczema.
In the following letter, Miss Grace
Stowe tells how successful she found this
treatment in her case.
“Prompted by a spirit of gratitude, I
have much pleasure in testifying to the
benefit I have received from using
Rexona, The Rapid Healer. Before try-
ing Rexona I tried pretty well all sorts
of Ointments for Eczema, with which I
had been troubled for some time, but
could not find anything to cure it. It
was not until I tried Rexona that I
found anything that would benefit
it, but now, after using Rexona
for a short time, it has all
disappeared and has left the
skin smooth and clear. Rexona
is the best remedy for
Eczema I have ever come
across, and I heartily recom-
mend it to all who are
troubled with Eczema.”
Rexona, the New Rapid Healing Ointment, is particularly designed to remove
Eczema and other kindred skin affections, and is an unsurpassed preparation for
this purpose. Rexona promptly allays the irritations and itching, taking away
the desire to scratch the parts affected, quickly dries up any pus or exuding matter,
eases the ache and pain, and, being a germicide of the highest order, promptly
destroys all dangerous germs and bacteria, building up at the same time new
skin tissues and cells —so that in the end a new and perfect skin is formed where
the disease formerly existed.
REXONA is sold only in triangular tins at 1/6 and 3/-

Democracy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.
Mr. Cann is of opinion that there should be no
medical examination of first and second saloon
passengers on arrival at Australian ports.
—Daily press.
Bass :
LO, our democracy
Proud and triumphant!
All men are equal—
Murphy and Flannagan,
Hughes and McPherson,
Smith, Brown and Itobinson,
Cholmondely and Marjoribanks,
Also Amelia,
Percy and Moses!
All have one vote apiece.
No one can say to them :
“Kneel on your marrowbones
Kissing the mat.”
Tenor:
But you will observe—
Also write it on the tablets of your memory,
Of your shirt cuff,
Or the office blotting-pad,
Of cut it out and paste it in your hat—
That the privilege of a medical examination,
And the indignity and discomfort thereof,
And the chance of being rejected as a can-
didate for Australian citizenship
Should be entirely confined to steerage pas-
sengers.
Chorus :
For the white plague,
And the blue plague,
And the green plague,
And the plague that is of purple and gold
Extend not aft of the funnel!
Tenor:
Lo, the Labor Government is wise !
It hath been exalted by John Smith ;
It is set in an high place by him that
swingeth a pick
And by her that swirleth soap at a washtub.
Yea, it is wise and knoweth that the first
saloon is gilded
And the bunks of the steerage have blue
blankets.
Chorus :
The Labor Government knoweth a thing or
two !
The Hotel Australia is more than Casey’s
pub !
There are twenty shillings to the quid
And thirty-six beans to the quarter gross !
Bass :
Lo, our democracy
Free and exalted'!
Splendid equality,
Bulwark of liberty,
Stamping on fetters
And chains that our grandfathers
Brushed with the whiskers
That trailed from their jaws !
Tenor:
But you will also kindly make a note of the
fact
That democracy requireth a little pepper and
salt,
And cannot be eaten entirely raw save at
election times !
Chorus :
The pepper of democracy is f s. d. !
And the pepper-pot thereof is Cohen !
Who shall medically inspect Cohen and his
friends?
Bass :
Lo, our democracy, great and unchallenged !
Tenor:
But kept by circumstances in reasonable
restraint!
Bass :
Manhood triumphant riding to victory!
Tenor:
But supplied with a suitable mount by the
investor, whose brother is the tourist!
Bass :
Clang we the ■ gates on the Old World dis-
eases
That festered in dens where the tyrant was
lord !
Tenor:
But leave the side entrance a foot or so
open
That the same gouty lord and his friends
may come through !
Chorus :
Glory be to democracy.
And the policeman,
And the inspector of nuisances,
-And the health officer,
And all who attend to the needs of the poor!
Bass :
Glory be to democracy!
Tenor:
Glory be to the policeman !
The poor have their needs attended to, and
the rich are left to stew in their own
champagne !
Chorus :
Labor is exalted and everything is quite nice,
Hallelujah! (Also d —n.)

GEORGE STREET.
Bill Buley’s Bull.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.
BULEY’S big Hereford bull stood in
the middle of the strongly-fenced
yard and threw clods and dust nil
over his broad back and red, gleaming sides,
and muttered wrathy challenges to the wide
world beyond the sapling palisade. Outside
the fence stood Buley. clutching a ten-foot
prop in his right hand and his whiskers in
his left, trying to figure out the best and
safest _ means of getting the bull into an
adjoining pen. To say the least, the bull
wasn’t an animal that could be easily
handled. As far as Buley was concerned,
the Hereford was boss, and knew it. The
only one to leave the yard that morning had
been Buley, who had ingloriously abandoned
his carefully-laid plans for the attack after
a short but well-packed argument and scut-
tled over the fence in great haste. Had it
not been for the timely arrival of his red-
headed twelve-year-old son, the farmer’s
cause would have been a hopeless one.
Buley’s bull was an autocrat, and an out-
size one at that. It was not that he could
be said to be of uncertain temper. He was
always so sure to be in an evil mood that
there was nothing uncertain about it. He
was also astonishingly agile and pugnacious,
and feared nothing—with an exception. The
red-headed nipper above referred to was the
exception. Ever since the day the bull had
been deluded into charging young Bill as the
latter sauntered across the yard, and had
suddenly found himself seized by the tail
and tortured with violent twistings thereof,
and belted with a rail, and kicked all over,
especially the left eye, he had been accus-
tomed to regard the boy with respect. The
mere proximity of Buley’s son sufficed to
quiet the bull even in his most violent trans-
ports of rage.
On this occasion young Bill —or, to give
him the name he usually went by, Ginger—-
slipped into the pen at a moment when the
bull was engaged in blowing mightily through
the fence into Buley’s face, quite unaware
of the danger that threatened him. A sec-
ond later the beast was crouching, in a vain
endeavor _ to make himself several sizes
smaller, in a corner of the new pen, for
history had repeated itself, with the excep-
tion that this time it had been the right
eye that was kicked. Ginger punched him
in a few new places before he shut the gate,
and then Buley leaned over and passed him
one with the prop on his own account. The
bull turned like a cat and snorted at Buley,
and he fell off the gate in his fright into
the thick, _ black dust of the yard. The bull
wasn’t going to take any slack from Buley.
The new pen was agqlnst the outside
fence, and after the offended animal had
sulked awhile he. began to take an interest
in what was going on outside. To begin
with, a terrier discovered him and yapped
insultingly through a crack; and after a
little it got on the Hereford’s nerves. He
gave his great, curly head a shake,'snorted,
and jammed a ponderous horn at the open-
ing. The horn broke its way through and
knocked the dog over, and when he drew
his head back the slab came with it, leaving
an aperture wide enough for the bull to
poke his nose through. He tried it, and the
dog snapped at his muzzle and cleared out.
This annoyed the bull. He roared with in-
dignation, and had a second go at the fence,
and broke another bit off it. He could get
nearly half his head out now, but the rest of
the structure held firm, and after a few
minutes’ wrenching, during which he had the
misfortune to poke his nose against an ex-
tremely sharp nail, he resumed his sulking.
He was still busy getting up arrears of
reticence, when, half an hour latey, Myrtle
Johnson and Alicia Brady wandered along
on their way to school.
Now,’ had Myrtle and Alicia been boys
they wouldn’t have teased the bull through
the fence. Boys tease bulls right enough,
but they get up a tree, or on the roof, or
a-top of the stoutest post the yard boasts to
do it. . They don’t poke savage bulls in the
ribs with a stick through a weak fence. A
boy first of all examines the fence, and if it
is a flimsy one and likely to collapse he gets
some other boy who isn’t in the joke to do
the teasing, whilst he climbs well out of
harm’s way, with a generous margin for
safety, and waits to be amused. This didn’t
occur to the girls. They had heard their
brothers say it was great fun to tease
Buley’s Prancer, but they were not aware
of the elaborate precautions against sur-
prise the boys always took. So they got sharp
twigs and made a simultaneous attack upon
Prancer as he lowered within easy range.
It didn’t please the bull. He had already
been . soured beyond all endurance that
morning, and the little sharp sticks hurt.
He gave an alarming bellow of pain and
rage and boosted at the fence. It held, but
cracked in a way that wouldn’t have misled
any boy into repeating the experiment. The
girls, however, with screeching taunts, - re-
turned to the attack, and jabbed at the great
head, and one of the sharp points got
Prancer on his nose. There arose a,fearful
roar of bitterness, followed by a crash as a
ton of beef hurled itself at the barrier.
Splinters flew like bullets, heavy slabs
rattled into the middle of the road, and
Prancer came out.
And he came out . fast. Fortunately for
the girls he carried a quantity of rails and
slabs on his horns and around his neck,
and it got in his way and about his feet,
sending him sprawling in the dust. ' By the
time he had scrambled to his feet and got
clear the girls were out of sight in a small
culvert, where they remained, trembling and
terrified, for the greater oart of the day. In
view of their conduct it is pleasipg to re-
late that their mothers whipped them for
coming home late and the schoolmistress
whipped them again next morning for miss-
ing afternoon school.
For a full minute the bull stood and gazed
about him in a vain endeavor to locate his
tormentors, and then turned and trotted off
with head high and tail standing straight
out. Buley and another man were convers-
ing quietly in the road in front of the house,
and as they looked up and beheld the fear-
some apparition they faded away with
miraculous rapidity. Ginger had gone for
the day, so helo from that source was im-
possible ; and Buley groaned in dismay as
his property swept like a conquering in-
vader up the road, charging miscellaneous
articles as he met them. Old Dan Matthews,
who was digging a post-hole near the -road,
looked up in time to see a vast red form
with frothing mouth and wide, thick horns
sweeping down upon him; and Dan. who
hed been rheumatic for years and creaked
with stiffness as he moved, was up amongst
the top branches of the nearest gum almost
before his hastily-discarded shovel had
reached the ground.
Prancer halted just long enough to send
the shovel flying up into the foliage with its
owner, and for the next few minutes his
route and rate of progression could be noted
by the tremendous dust-cloud that rose from
the road that led to Duigan’s pub, which
stood back off the track amongst a gum
thicket. There were a lot of men at the
shanty when the bull arrived, and the day
being hot they were lying about on the

ZAM-BUK CLEANSED THE WOUNDS AND CREW NEW,
HEALTHY SKIN AFTER OTHER TREATMENTS FAILED.
EVERY mother and housewife
whose life is made miserable
by the distressing pain and incpn-
yenience of bad legs or swollen
discharging ankles should
fallow the example pf Mrs. A. James,
of I f Growrie Street, Newtown, Sydney,
and apply Zam-Buk, the great antiseptic
and germfaidal healer, which is a proved
remedy for these complaints.
Immediately Zam-Buk is applied to a
poisoned or suppurating surface, it sets to
work to cleanse the tissues, kill the poison
germs, make the wound clean and healthy,and
finally promote the growth of new, healthy skin.
“ I sustained a scratch on my left ankle,” says Mrs.
James, “ and the dye getting into the wound from
the stocking caused blood-poison to set in, my leg all
breaking out into ulcers. Inflammation spread up my
leg, and the swelling was very great, more so as I tried
to get about on it when I should have been resting. The
limb continued bad for three months, during which time I
tried several ointments, etc., but the other treatments
brought me not the slightest relief. I was, luckily,
recommended to use Zam-Buk.
THE BALM BROUGHT ME RELIEF AT THE VERY
FIRST APPLICATION—
Even in obstinate
cases of eczema,
ulceration, blood-
poisoning, leg sores,
ulcers, ringworm and
scalp sores, Zam-Buk
penetrates to the root
of the disease, and
quickly destroys and
expels the poisonous
germs which cause
the trouble. Of all
chemists 'and stores,
1/6 and 3/6 per pot.
it reduced the inflammation and swelling, cleansed the wound, and
made it look much healthier. The wound now healed rapidly,
and I have hadi no ill-effects from the injury since.
“ Zam-Buk was also most healing in a case where the heat of the
blood brought out a skin eruption, which was most irritating, being
one of the severest forms of eczema. I used different remedies,
but Zam-Buk was then applied, and its soothing and cooling effect
was at once noticed. It finally cured the outbreak. Since then
we have used Zam-Buk for all injuries and bruises and anything
of a like nature, with alwavs excellent results."

Chamberlain s
Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy.
This is the best medicine procurable for bowel complaint in all its forms. It
relieves pain in the stomach, dysentery, diarrhoea and colic. It has been the means
of saving more pain and suffering than any other known remedy. Thousands of
mothers in all parts of the world have given it to tlieir children and now sing its
praises. This medicine is especially valuable in checking Diarrhoea which nearly
always attacks the babies when teething. One dose will relieve pains in the stomach
and it seldom takes more than three or four doses to stop a severe attack of Diarrhoea.
Always take Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy at the first unusual
looseness of the bowels. There is no class of ailments that attack the system quicker
than bowel complaints and when a medicine is wanted it is wanted quickly. What
has made Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy so popular is that the relief
is just as quick.r' It is a medicine that should be kept in the home at all times and we
advise you to procure a bottle at once, for it will save trouble later on and perhaps be
the means of saving a life.

When the liver and bowels do not act life
is a failure. Chamberlain's Tablets wake
these drowsy organs like the sun wakes
the earth and the whole body laughs. There
is more happiness in an eighteenpenny
box of Chamberlam si Tablets than you
ever dreamed of.
verandah and in the shade of the adjacent
trees. It was impossible to see along the
road from the pub, and so Prancer’s visit
came as a kind of a surprise to the loungers.
He turned off the route and towards the pub
like an old hand, arriving in the yard at a
twenty-knot gait, head to the ground and
froth flying like spray about his gleaming
shoulders. Unannounced as his advent was
its effect was none the less marked. In a
second the doors and windows were closed
behind a stream of badly-scared fugitives.
Prancer swept like thunder along the veran-
dah, rattling his sturdy, clean horns along
the slab wall as he went, in a vain hope
of finding something or somebody worthy of
attention. Around the corner and behind
the shanty he charged, landing amongst the
fowls and pigs with terrifying results, as
far as noise was concerned. The fowls made
for the 1 tall timber without losing time about
it, 1 P'rancer helped the squealing pigs to
t|ie :l sdrub : wifh‘excessive enthusiasm. Then,
the dog slipping discreetly into its
kennel, he jioosted the whole outfit at the
moon, and finally dropped, winded, in the
shade of a big currajong that stood by the
back door.
An' hour passe<j, a n< ! silepce reigned pt
Duigan’s. ' The pigs and fowls Jay about ip
the scrub, with the outraged flog and some
. kennel fof company. Inside, the
..... f sepiopsly put about by their
fopc-ed imp) isonpaent in the pub, d ran l? beer
and s n iked, or sought places where the
heat seemed less great, and slept. Once
during the hour Duigan opened the bar door
and went out on the verandah. The bull
heard aim and cpme around the corner so
silently and rapidly that Duigan. who was
short and fat and scant of breath, couldn’t
get back to the door, and had to do the
round of the house three times with aston-
ishing speed before he could regain his
haven, those inside having closed and bolted
the portal at the first intimation of danger.
It would undoubtedly have gone hard with
the publican had not Mrs. Duigan eventually
induced the defenders of the garrison to draw
the bolt, using a stout bit of batten with
which to back her argument. The demented
Duigan, too exhausted to give voice to the
bitter rage which consumed him, was hauled
into safety just as he was on the point of
giving up the ghost. After that incident the
door was left closed, and the bull returned
to the cool comfort of the currajong.
The heat increased as the day wore on,
and Prancer, possessed of a terrific thirst
as the result of his strenuous morning, rose
and followed the track to the billabong to
drink. There was a trough in front of the
shanty, but the bull had been in too much
of a hurry when in that part of the yard to
notice it.’ Besides, he wanted to wallow in
the thick, black mud, because the flies were
troublesome. So he flopped into the shallow
water and splashed about in bovine enjoy-
ment, and stayed there several minutes. It
was whilst he was so engaged that Scobie
drove into the yard and unhitched his horse,
turning him loose to graze on the stock
route. Scobie ran a little establishment
somewhere in the scrub amongst the hills —■
a paying enterprise that the revenue officers
would have given a good deal to drop across
—and his visit to the shanty that day was
prompted by business. He lifted a seven-
gallon keg from his trap, swung it to his
shoulder, and marched up to the pub door.
He found it closed, and, puzzled, tried to
open it. It remained firm, so Scobie put the
keg down, cupped his hands, and yelled
through the keyhole for Duigan.
Prancer heard the hail as soon, as Duigan
did, and responded to it a lot quicker. The
kneeling Scobie, hearing something coming,
turned his head leisurely in the direction, of
the sound. The next instant he was racing
madly around the pub, taking all obstacles
in his stride and losing no pace at the cor-
ners. Like Duigan, he expended valuable
time each lap in trying to open the door,
which was by this time so thoroughly bar-
ricaded inside that Samson himself wouldn’t
have been able to do anything with it. Two
valuable seconds were thrown away at the
currajong. the straight, smooth trunk offer-
ing no chance to a would-be climber who
was sorely pressed for time. Scobie bounded
on the verandah in the third lap with
despair in his heart and Prancer breathing
down his back.
There was a sapling rafter running hori-
zontally across the verandah with a space
between it and the iron above. Scobie’s eye
caught it as he came along the straight, and
with his last pound of energy he sprang for
it as a monkey leaps for the nearest bough
when the hyena reaches for him. He grabbed
the stick and hauled himself up just as the
astonished bull passed like an avalanche be-
neath. There was very little space between
the rafter and the red-hot sheet of corru-
gated iron above, and even that little tapered
to a V where the sapling touched the edge
of the verandah, but Scobie squeezed in, .
and, for the time at least, was grateful. He
panted like a gas-engine, and his legs and
arms hung powerless as he lay wedged be-
tween roof and rafter. The bull ranted and
ramped with rage and disappointment below
as he hunted for the escapee. Ur> and down
the verandah he trotted, finally locating
Scobie by the noise of the exhaust. He
halted with fore-legs extended and tail out-
stretched, and rolled a bloodshot eye at the
tree-ed one; and Scobie, with a dexterity
partly inherited, partly acquired by life-long
practice, spat tobacco-juice at it.
At that moment hoofs sounded on the hard
clay surface of the yard, and Scobie, peering
under the edge of the verandah, beheld, to
his horror, Everson, the trooper, dismount-
ing from his horse. Just a few yards off
and in full view stood the keg of illicit
spirit, and detection was inevitable. Scobie
groaned in anguish of spirit and drew his
limbs in out of sight, with a curse for the
trooper and a volume of the same for the
vicious brute that had caused the mischief.
With a sinking heart he waited the turn of
events. And at the eleventh hour came
reprieve.
Savage bulls don’t generally discriminate
between persons, and this one was not dis-
posed to recognise any difference between
policeman aDd sinner. For several seconds
Prancer had been engaged in rubbing his eye
against his fore-leg to the accompaniment of
wrathy mutterings, and it was during these
few brief moments of inattention to business
that the trooper contrived to ride unmo-
lested into the yard, and, dismounting, ap-
proach to within a few yards of the shanty.
Prancer saw him out of his good eye just
as Scobie had given up all hope of future
freedom. His mood changed instantaneously
from despair to loud applause as the form
of the trooper flashed past beneath him
with the bull in close pursuit. The police-
man put up a very good performance, doing
the three times round in the best time so
far, and by the simple expedient of dodging
Prancer around the trunk of the currajong
and thus reversing the order of his retreat
he gained time enough to permit of a dash
to a low dead tree that stood in the clearing
in front. He sprang at the tree like a cat,
drawing himself up just as the massive head
smashed into the trunk, shaking down a
shower of dried bark and twigs and nearly
bringing Everson to the ground with sheer
fright.
“Encore!” remarked Scobie heartily,
craning his head under the edge of the
verandah and grinning cheerfully at the
discomfited constable.
“Oh, you’re there, are you,” responded
Everson sourly. “We’ll have that grin on
the other side of your face when I get ou£
of this, me lad.”
“When d’ y’ expect that will be, old man?”
queried Scobie pleasantly. “Looks t’ me
as though you’re there for quite a time.
Lovely day in th ? sun, ain’t it?” Then, as
Everson made no reply : “How’d a drop o’
what ! s in th’ keg go, eh? Oh, y' peedn’t
turn y ! nose pp. I seen y’ with y ? eye on it
a minute or so ago. Greedy! Gyeefly! Here,
you get t' blazes outep this"—to tile bull,
who had returned to the verandah and was
sniffing at Scobie with uplifted nose. With
deliberate intent and malice aforethought
he swung a long leg and kicked viciously.
Bellowing with disapprobation the bull
pirouetted about the clearing, rubbing his
nose in the dust. With his eyes gleaming
red he looked about him for something on
which to wreak vengeance, and his glance
alighting upon the keg, he flung his tail in
the air and came at it at a frightful pace.
The keg took the impact squarely in the
centre, and it flew like a rocket through the
air, smashing against the hitching-post at
the trough and discharging its contents into
the thirsty dust, to the accompaniment of a
joyous yell from Scobie and a groan of dis-
gust from the trooper, who saw his precious
evidence vanish before his eyes. Again
Prancer charged the now shattered keg, and
the heap of hoops and staves rattled against
the wall of the shanty, finally settling in a
pile below the window.
“Duigan!” called Scobie softly, not wish-
ing to disturb the animal.
“Phat’s th’ matter, Scobie?” came the
reply, and the window rose quietly a couple
of inches.
“Ssh !” answered Scobie, with his eye on
the bull. “Lift th’ window softly as y’ can
and get that broken keg in an’ burn it right
away.”
“Phwere’s th’ divil ov a cow, Scobie?”
queried the cautious but incorrect Duigan.
“Ah, never mind that. Th’ trooper’s here,
an’ that’s more to th’ point. Hurry, now.”
“But phwat if th’ cow charges th’ winder,
Scobie?”
“If he does,” replied Scobie passionately,
“I hope he gets in an’ tears y’ t’ jimrags.
y’old fool. Get th’ keg in an’ burn it, an’
shut up.”
The window opened wider. An arm stole
through the aperture, and a bunch of fingers
groped for the keg.
“Duigan,” came the voice of Everson from
his tree, “Leave that keg alone.”
“You shut up, Everson. Anyone would
think it was your keg. Don’t take any notice
of him, Duigan. He’s bold. Little further
to the left —that’s it. Now burn it before
you do anything else.”
“Roight,” said Duigan. “To h —l wid you,
Mister Everson.” The window closed noise-
lessly.
“That,” said Scobie to the trooper, cran-
ing his head under the spouting, “that’s a
load off me mind.”
The day grew hotter and hotter, and the
iron roof above Scobie drew from that
worthy torrents of profanity. He pleaded
with Duigan to open the window so that be
could make a dash for the heavenly luxury
of the bar, and Duigan flatly refused. The
trooper was in almost as unpleasant a posi-
tion, his tree affording no shade whatever
from the glaring sun-rays. The afternoon
was quiet. No one approached the shanty
to enliven matters, and thus time passed
slowly indeed. A few minor events occurred
—such as the complete demolition of the con-
stable’s helmet by Prancer, Everson having
the misfortune to drop it at a moment when
the bull, * going his rounds, halted for a
while to threaten him with what would
happen if he should descend; and the de-
moralisation of the cat. who, passinc sedately
through the yard, suddenly became aware of
the unpleasant proximity of the agile Prancer,
and found it necessary to sprint over an
acre of ground before she could get a chance
to scramble under a tank, where she spat
and growled incessantly for an hour.
At four o’clock two swagmen wandered in
and immediately selected suitable trees to
clamber into. Five o’clock found Wilson,
the drover, sitting on the verandah roof
arguing the point with Scobie, who wanted
him to get on the sheet of iron above him
and keep the sun off it; and Wilson wouldn’t
do it.
For awhile after that there was a lull.
Then a cloud of red dust floated up from the
road, evidence that some one was approach-
ing at speed. Scobie ceased his arguing
and awaited the arrival of the innocent. All
hands watched the progress of the dust-cloud.
Prancer, hearing the clatter of hoofs, got
ready and dug his horns into the dirt, throw-
ing a ton or so of clay and gravel over him-
self and working up into a fine frenzy. The
rattle of hoofs neared rapidly, and then a
pony burst into view, and, rounding the
clump of gums, came into the yard like a
meteor.
The bull took one glance at the outfit to
get his range, and stood as though petrified.
His tail dropped, his curly head turned with
the left side uppermost, and the rolling eyes
took on ap expression of appealing softness.
“God be thanked,” said Scobie devoutly.
“’Tis Ginger.”
The shaggy Shetland rolled on. There
came a wild yell, a broken bellow, a flash of
red sides, and an incredible quantity of dust,
and Prancer the bull was gone. And the
relieved garrison opened its doors, and those
within came out while those without went
in; whilst over several glasses drawn from
a cask that bore a stamp Scobie and the
trooper fraternised amicably.
