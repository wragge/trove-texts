The Bitter Cry of the Landlord.
All over the world of alleged civilisation the
bitter cry of the landlord is beginning to
echo abroad. Wherever the doctrines of
human equality have been preached, there
the edifice of property and vested interests
commences to totcer, and straightway the
host of unclean things which it has sheltered
issue forth, like the creatures of the night
which gibbered on the reeling walls of de-
serted Babylon, to scream out discordant
wailings about the approaching collapse of
society, religion, and all things fair and
beautiful besides. For almost the first time
in history the landlord condescends to apolo-
gise for his existence. Fifty years ago he
posed as a great I AM ; he hardly even pra-
te aded to be a useful member of society, and
took his stand on the good old theory that
the earth had been given to him by the
Lord, and that he was the Lord’s anointed
representative. To-day, however, he stands
on a somewhat lower plane, and endeavours
to prove that he is the keystone of the social
arch, that without him the fabric of society
would inevitably fall into ruins and bury the
human race amid the resulting chaos, that
without him the poor would starve, and the
labourer be unemployed, and the noonday
of civilisation be lost in eternal night. Bat
perhaps it is better to let the hereditary
loafer define his position in his own words.
“Landholder,” writing to the Lithgow
(N.S.W.) Enterprise, one of the most
active organs of the cause of Australian
Land Nationalisation, thus lays down the
central axioms of the great law by which the
rich are to grow ever richer, and the poor for
ever poorer until the Day of Judgment, and
everyone is to be content in the station to
which Providence has called him :
“ The poor ye have always with you,” said the
world’s greatest teacher ; and yet M'Glynn and
Henry George in America have started an Anti-
Poverty Society. Is it not impious thus to work
against the plain dictates of revealed religio a ?
„ . . Without the poor what would be the use
of being rich? . . . The Lord gives wealth to
some to teach them the power of command, and
to others ha gives poverty to bless them by the
lessons of humble, willing, and devoted service.
Private property in land is the cause of material
progress. Where land values are the highest
there you find the greatest) development of the
arts of civilisation. For social refinement, scien-
tific attainments, and world-wide philanthropy we
go to great cities like London and New York,
where, according to Henry George, ‘the owner
ship of a plot of land is a fortune ’ : certainly not
to the wilds of Australia, where land can be had
for a mere song. There is a reverse side to this
picture, but where would be the scape for the
exercise of the divine faculties of benevolence and
large-hearted charity by the rich, and of patient
faith and uncomplaining humility by the poor, if
none were very poor or excessively rich? . . .
Could the impious hands that are struggling to
abolish the blessing they miscall the curse of
poverty succeed, our civilisation would surely
decay ; we should descend by sure degrees to the
level of the savage, and finally to that of the
brute. Capital gives employment to labour. . .
Misguided people say “labour is the producer of
all wealth.” They take no note of the fact that it
requires a rich man to set a poor man to work ;
else why is it that we have an unemployed diffi-
culty ? Get rid of our rich men, and the whole lot
of us will be unemployed, and wa shall all starve
together.”
* * *
“ The poor ye have always with you.”
This little text, as applied by the land-
owners and landstealers of the earth, is the
great central blasphemy of an accursed
system of spoliation. Jesus Christ uttered
these much-abused words as a mournful re-
proach to the stony-hearted greed which kept
the geeat mass of mankind in hopeless
poverty, but “The poor ye shall have
always with you ”He never did say. He
merc y recorded a pitiable fact one of the
saddest features of His pitiable surround-
ings, and His words have been tortured int >
a Divine plea for the existence of eternal
p overty. In like manner he mentioned the
existence of murder, idolatry, adultery, and
all manner of cruelty, and with similar rea ;
sou it might be held that the great Re-
former advocated their continuance and bide
the w <rid lay no ms h-Aiid o i th^ae
hoary sins. The crucified Redeemer, ac-
cording to the theories of the modern
Pharisees, was born at Bcth’ehem that He
might act as bjiliff to the land-jumpers oi
the earth, and the Gospels were written and
handed down to servo as a perpetual Tor-
rens’ title to the stolen estates which the
rich man keeps under lock and key, while
tie poor—whom ye have always with you—
starve and die in the back-slams of crowded
cities.
♦ * *
Bat it is not alone on the words of his
forgotten Goo that the landowner relies for
hisdefence. The phantomof universal poverty
and world-wide insolvency is conjured up as
the inevitable result of the abolition of
landlordism “ Get rid of our rich men and
all will be unemployed ” is the favourite
plea of monopoly, and no doubt this would
prove true if the rich men were to leave this,
earth and take the land along with them
which, no doubt, they would do if circum-
stances only permitted. But “ the earth is
the Lord's,” and it is anchored fast to its
foundations of eternal rock. From it
originally sprang all the wealth contained
m the buay cities of that little builder—
man, wealth which began to accumulate ages
before there was any fungus growth of capi-
talists—wealth whose first instalments were
wrung from it by the first man, whoever he
might be, when there was no one either to
«■ tftploy him or to pay him wages for his toil.
And somehow that pre historic Socialist
struggled through his existence successfully,
and without tools or capital or knowledge
he founded the human race and laid the first
stone of all succeeding civilisation. But his
descendants, armed with a vast store of
knowledge amassed in the slow course of
■’ges, with art and science to aid them and a
coantless multitude of resources, of which he
never dreamed, at their command, cannot,
according to the theories of their slave-
drivers, stand alone and unfettered as did
their ancestors in the days of their darkness.
They must either lean upon the broken reed
of the capitalist who has stolen their heri-
tage, and sue humbly to him for permission
to earn their bread—or else they must sink
to the level of the brutes until, like the
brutes, they pass away.
* * #
Australia has borrowed her system of
landlordism from England, but in England
itself landlordism, as now understood, is com-
paratively a thing of yesterday. The hardy
tribes which first made good their hold upon
the European continent were all organised,
more or less, upon the basis of Socialism,
and land was almost invariably the property
of the State—not of the individual. But
the advent of feudalism brought about a
change. The surface of the earth was lent
out to the barons of the Middle Ages, and In
return for the use of their huge estates they
were pledged to perform military service
whenever called upon, in company with
i heir tenants, who held their farms on the
same warlike tenure. Wars were carried on
at a cheap rate in those days because the
hereditary rulers of the people had them-
selves to pay the cost of the great game of
bloodshed. Campaigns, which nowadays
would bankrupt a nation, were reduced to
sudden raids, and as often as not were
brought to an abrupt termination because
the noble lords of that distant past felt the
imperative necessity of getting back before
they were eaten out of house and
home in exchange for a tEfle of
barren glory. There were no national
debts piled up then by the accumulated cost
of ancient wars and forays; the barons of
old knew better than to permit extrava-
gancies which would have mortgaged them
for future ages, but in which the common
herd would not have participated, and as the
exercise of a “spirited foreign policy”—to
quote the phrase of the mountebank who is
still revered as the patron saint of Toryism
—involved much loss and much personal in-
jury to the British House of Peers that body
was less given to meddling with the
affairs of distant nations tHan is the
gathering of Imbeciles which now oc-
cupies the hereditary Chamber. But the
spirit of the Lombard and the Hebrew
gradually entered into these men of open
violence, and, after many manoeuvres, they
succeeded ultimately in shifting the burden '
of military expenditure on to the people.
The lands which were lent, not granted , to
these brigands ia mail as a fair equiva-
lent for the defence of their country ihey
still retained, but they repudiated every in-
dividual responsibility attached to their pos-
session, and on this atrocious steal is
founded the modern Institution of land-
lordism—the institution which the land-
owners describe as God-given, but which, in
its modern sense, is merely the ingenious
device of a race of corouetted thieves.
* * •
And under this modern system of land-
lordism the world has made stupendous ad-
vances in material prosperity. Men who
were not landlords have discovered the
powers of steam and electricity, have found
new continents, and exploited new nations,
and have revealed treasures of gold such as
were never dreamt of before, while the
monopolists of creation, animalised and ren-
dered somnolent by idleness and luxury,
dozed in their lordly mansions, and only
woke to reap where they had not sown.
Men who were not landlords have built up a
great literature, have created manufactures,
and established commerce ; and because
these things have been done in their time
the s ealms of ti e eartu po.nt to the bene-
ficence of their sway, and ask how the
human race would have fared without their
fostering supervision. And while the land-
-1 ;ss multitude have been doing these things
the landlords have been waging hideous wars
with the blocd and gold of the despoiled
masses, and have been piling up immea-
surable debts for the hungry toilers of the
future to liquidate ; they have been obtaining
huge grants of land from corrupt Govern-
ments by backstairs influence, and have
graciously permitted the poor, whom they
have always with them, to live upon it, and
have exacted from them three-fourths of the
value of their labour in return for the privi-
lege of existing in a world which a God
made to order by a servile Church—had
created only for the rich.
* * *
“The poor ye have always with you,”
i aid Jesus of old, and the poor of Eng-
land we have always with us in Aus-
tralia, for they come out by thousands to
escape from the curse of the men who have
taken from them the soil, and have given
them in return the burdens which the soil
originally bore ; and, when they arrive in
the New World, they find that the landlord
is. there before them, and that, with the
money which he has wrung from them in
past years, he has bought up the land by
provinces, and merely offers them a new
servitude in exchange for the old. Why the
masses of England are poor a glance at the
revenue returns will explain. Land, the
exclusive luxury of the rich, pays about l|d.
in the £ towards the national expenses.
Coffee pays 2s. 6d. in the £; tsa, 7s. ;
tobacco, 16s. Bd., and other articles of diet
in proportion. The labourer, with 20s. a
week, eats as much as the landlord—or
rather, Nature meant him to do so, though
the chance comes but rarely—and, in so
doing, he contributes one-fourth, at least, of
his scanty earnings to the Government in
various forms of taxation, while the rich
monopolist gives to the public Treasury at
most one-hundredth part of the income for
which he neither toils nor spins. Yet, in
the face of these accumulated horrors of
loathsome greed and hideous hypocrisy, the
lando vner, when put on his defence, pleads
t hat the Loud has made him rich in order
that he may fulfil his mission of aiding the
poor. The Lord, in truth, sent him into
the world naked and penniless, and when
tyrannous craft has made him rich he merely
employs th 9 poor to make him richer still.
When his serfs ate too old and feeble to ful-
fil this duty he assists them — thus. Here is
a picture of London life by an American
journalist — a picture from the great city
which contains more treasure, and pre-
sumedly more benevolence, than any other
on the face of the earlh :
“Yesterday afternoon I saw a really awful
street battle, a fight between a poor old woman
and a mangy dog for the possession of a bone,
near London Bridge. The bone lay on ths side-
walk, or lather near it; it had but the least bit of
decayed meat still attached to it. The dog came
along and saw the bone. The dog was hungry.
The old woman tottered by and likewise saw the
bone, and was likewise hungry. The two beings
simultaneously rushed to and seized the bone.
Both fought with each other for possession. It was
a strange, sad spectacle, one of the strangest and
saddest ever seen even in strange, sad London.
But the old woman, though hunger almost made
her strong, was no match for the dog, who ran off
with the bone, while the old woman cursed him as
he ran. This woman was one of the tramps who
have not where to lay their heads, and who sleep,
fight, drink, eat, live, and die in the open air, or
fog. There are at the present moment over 20,000
of these.
That bone was probably the only meal to be
procured in all London which was not taxed
in some shape to pay for the burden which
the rich landowners shifted off their
shoulders and on to those of the poor 200
years ago—and it went to a dog, while
20,000 disinheiited human beings were rsady
to fight and curse and pray for its possession,
* * *
At last, however, the evil of landlordism
is beginning to react upon itself. In Eng-
land and Ireland nearly a sixth of the arable
soil lies idle and untilied because the land-
lord demands so much for its use that the
farmer has nothing left to pay his labourer—
the cheapest of all toilers—a slave who re-
ceives about 9*. a week, and pays away a
fourth of that amount in direct and indirect
taxation. In England this miserable serf
endures his lot in comparative silence, but
in Ireland he has at last begun to protest,
and the lord of the soil—the man who props
up the cause of civilisation and holds his
wealth in order that he may do good to the
poor—has a remedy to suggest. The Bat, an
active organ of English Toryism, speaks :
“We must sooner or later recognise the fact
that the Irish are in a state of mutiny, and that
they must be treated like the Indian revolutionists
and the Burmese savages were. As a method
milder than bullets and yet undoubtedly effica-
cious, I some months ago suggested the lash. My
advice was not taken.”
“ The Lord giveth wealth to some to teach
them the power of command,” and what the
Lord has given is to be expended In the
purchase of a scourge and a gallows for the
poor.

■When the wilds of Australia become
crowded with toiling, suffering humanity,
then will Australian landlordism be what
English landlordism now is. The only hope
for the New World lit s in a change of
policy before the landlords become the sole
lawmakers of the Continent, and rule it as
they already rule the suffering mother-
country, while the vast mass of the popula
! tion degenerate into hopeless, lifeless, soul-
less slavery. The one good feature in the
system of the Middle Ages must be revived ;
the land must bear the cost of govern,
ment, as it did before the so-called noble-
men of England conceived the idea of trans-
ferring their responsibilities to the shoulders
of the landless multitude, and, whether the
impost bears the name of rent or taxation,
the result will be the same. Private land-
lordism will be utterly abolished ; Australia
wil] no longer be drained of her wealth by
paying tribute to foreign land-syndicates,
and the budding oligarchy which threatens
to enslave the new nations of the South will
be broken for ever. The cry of the land-
lords is their appeal against the reform
which they can already see looming in the
distance, but the earth is weary of them and
their greed and blasphemy, and the time is
at hand when they will inflict the curse of
their existence upon their fellow-men no
more.
A Foreign Sway.
The New South Wales Premier—who has rev
yet contrived to have a surplus in his Treasur;
which did not result from the sale of Crown land
to private persons—proposes to “ wipe out th
deficit with the stroke of a pen ” by alienatin
Australian lands from the Australians, and cor
cealing the pressure temporarily resulting fro
his peculiar system cf finance under a tenfold anc
permanent pressure of foreign landlordism. H
would cut the land up into blocks and offer It i
the English market, and, with angelic simplicity
he remarks that “ this would attract the English
farmers, and secure the most desirable class o:
colonists.”
* * #
In the first instance, there is no guarantee tha
the purchasers would be intending bona fid
colonists. They would more probably be th
foreign appropriators of capital, who, with the
store wrung from the ages of enslavement of thei
own countrymen, would be able to bid higher
than the others for the privilege, not of having
the land to work, but of holding a legal power o:
preventing others from working it, except on theii
own exorbitant terms. In the next, supposing i
were expressly stipulated that the purchasers
should reside on and improve the land, who would
be the men likely to desire such a change froir
their present circumstances ? Not the successfu
farmers, but these who found themselves unable
to make both ends meet “at home,” and who
would, therefore, endure the expense of the
journey and the clearing of new land in the hope
of doing better abroad. But these men—where
are they to find the money for such a project
Under the circumstances, they can only do so by
borrowing; and, of course, on the spot, from the
English landlords. Then they commence opera-
tions hampered with mortgages, and everybody
knows that these capitalists manipulate tha
market at the sales after harvest, so as to pur-
chase the produce at a price that will not leave
the farmer a margin for both household expanses
and interest. By this means they grab the in-
terest in the shape of cheapness, aud then sue the
farmer for not paying it to them over again in the
shape of money. Eventually they will have an-
propriated alike tha land and the produce, aud the
working farmer will have become a pauper This
is exceedingly nice for the landlord, who ought to
be extremely graceful to Sir ’Enery for offering
him the opportunity of doing the job upon a
wholesale scale. To possess half the arable land
in New South Wales, after getting its produce at
half-price, and extracting the half so given from
the producers’ pockets again by bankruptcy pro-
ceedings, without spending one-quarter halfpenny
upon the production, is a “ throw in ” which might
well make a Rothschild’s mouth water.
* * *
Then, of course, this procedure has the effect of
lowering the market rates for the Indigenous
farmer who must accordingly borrow to meet
hard times, and so he, in turn, is chewed up by
the monster. And all this is to say nothing of
dummyism and the importation of foreign pauner
labour to work the foreign “ owned ” land to the
detriment of the free labour of Australia
“iTady is? Uite ° ld - world institutions
* * *
This is no fancy picture. The same thing is ac-
tually being done In these lands by our own leaL
lators, and .he records of the several offices nf
titles could reveal only too many a tale of ruthless
rapine and fraud committed in precisely the same
manner. And if it is possible here, where, as y?t
the money has in a great degree, to be mkdo for
the purpose as the job proceeds, what have we
not to apprehend from a country where it has al-
ready been monopolised, and only li 6S waiting the
opportunity to be thrown massively Into the task?
• * •
We emphatically declaim against the sale of
any State lands at all, even to those in our own
midst, much less would we see them passed into
the hands of these over whom the nation has
neither influence nor control. The land should be
as free as the air to those who wish to use it rt
Is not so difficult to have it so-the experiment
has been partly tried, and with magnificent sun-
cess. When the gold-mines of Victoria were al
most all held under miners’ rights, they tere
worked in & bona-fide manner, and when w lre
there fewer bogus companies, formed for the mere
purpose of selling out to somebody else an rt
making calls to pay a managers sffary than
under that system ? It is only the facilities offered
by a lease for holding the ground un worked that
have favoured the formation cf speculative com.
panies, and the still greater facilities of private
ownership that have enriched the idle owners
with as much as 80 per cent, of the gold extracted
and kept bona-fide mining on private lands
unremuneratlye, until the urgent necessity of the
case called forth the Mining on Private prnw!
Act. Exactly the same thing i 3 tX
whether land is held for gold miffing
mg, only the latter is slower in operation and the
results are, .therefore, less quickly to be
The State lease, with compensation for improve*
ments m safer for the people than the freehold
and the land right, except in special cases, would
be better still. The alienation of the land enables
t to be held nnproduotively, and blackmail to be
levied for the right of using it. The alienation to
citizens of the Australian nation is bad enough as
piaclng the masses at the mercy of p-i/ate greed
but the alienation to foreigners is a hundred times
worse, as it not only does-his, but prevents The
deterrent Influence of public opinion, and even-
tually taunts reined al legation by the cert,in


irecommendation that Her Most Appropriative
Majesty shall veto the needed measure in the in-
terests of Her Majesty’s grovelling English all-
appropriate™ in England.
* * *
The land is virtually the bread. When the feelings
■of Australians are so debased that they can tolerate
a proposal to relieve a temporary embarrassment
by selling to foreign money-holders the lasting
monopoly of their bread, then, and not till then,
■shall we fear that the public voice will not be
raised in 'condemnation of Sir Henry Parkes’
latest suggestion. Meanwhile, we are striving to
lead the van of progress as a nation, and all the
specious arguments which the manipulators of
■other people’s industry may propound will scarcely
persuade us to retrograde.
The Plot Thickens.
It remains no longer a theory—it is a proved fact
—that the hereditary lords of England view with
alarm and jealousy the growth of popular emanci-
pation, the spread of independence and freedom.
Their latest measure intended to overthro w this
later growth—a measure prompted by the instinct
of self-preservation in its last struggle of despair—
would be supremely ludicrous • in its childishness
were not the treachery and ambition of many of
the so-called representatives of the country an
element of danger. What these lords, forsooth,
propose, is that, being lords and aristocrats and
the effete remnants of a social tyranny which they
wish to perpetuate and re-establish upon the
people at large, they may be allowed, upon merely
resigning their seats temporarily in the House of
Lords, to bamboozle their way into the House of
Commons, and thereby make twoHojises cf Lords
to the utter annihilation of the House of the
People.
* * *
There is little danger of their seeking to pro-
ceed at once (should they gain what they wish) to
introduce a Reform Bill for the abolition of the
dummifled Commons, or even for the immediate re-
striction of the franchise. That would provoke
civil war, and, as they well know, that would end
in Britain becoming a Republic. They only desire
to strengthen their position by chicanery.
* ♦ *
They would simply prevent any radical reform
measures from passing the Commons, and, of
course, none would ever be broached in their own
original Chamber. They would slyly work in
measures that would hamper and interfere with
existing reforms by means of legal intricacies
without appearing to do so, andpromote grovelling
servility and Imperialism whenever they saw an
opportunity to debase the public mind with
slobber. They would hamper the proceedings of
Parliament and cause the Radical party to appear
in the light of obstructionists. Gradually they
would hope to undo all the goad that has been
done, and revert to the old system of Court rule.
• * *
The only question is, do they think for a
moment that, supposing the measure of permis-
sion duly passed, the people would be block-
headed enough to return them? Perhaps they
really imagine so. Perhaps they think that a
regard for present company would prevent any
vigorous opposition in the Commons, should only
one of them succeed in being elected, to any job-
bery that might go on in the lordly Chamber.
Just so ;’then, of course, the opposers would be
branded* as personally offensive, and the grovel-
ling party would for awhile gain in influenc?.
But if all this were to take place it would only
precipitate the end. If they are fond of their
titles, they would do better to cling to them in
obscure silence; not to arouse hostility by seeking
ufner the medlseval glitter and power which those
titles once carried.
• * *
But it is just this glittering sway to which
they aspire, and no effort do they intend to spare
(for regaining it. And, though they will not suc-
ceed-for Freedom, though often beffled, will
never be defeated—they are capable of inflicting
terrible harm upon those Institutions which are
as yet scarcely formed or set into their natural
hardy constitution. They cannot conquer, but
they may delay and hinder the other side. Eng-
land needs to be on the alert against the disease
that is still lingering in her frame.
•, * #
And it is to this diseased and sickening body
that we are asked to link our own comparative
health for contamination! Thanks, we would
rather not I We have no hatred for England or
things English, but we have for things enslaving
and debasing. When England or any other
civilized country asks us to join in a closer union
of friendship and freedom, we shall only be too
happy to comply. But it must be a union of free-
dom, not a bond linking us down to the slavery
from which we seek to make our escape. Were
j- ngland itself to call us now, we should refuse,
for the same reason that we should decline to give
up our cottage and go to share the mansion of a
leper. Now, it is not England—not the suffering
leper—that calls to us, but the lordly taint, the
leprosy, seeking us for its new prey.
* * *
In a word, when, as a free and independent
nation, we can with any other ass'st in the Federa-
tion of the Free World, we are ready. But we
will not federate against our freedom ; and if any-
thing else were wanted to prove that this latter is
the nature of the Imperial scheme now set before
us, the Earl of Dunravan’s proposition is just in
the nick of time to furnish that revelation. Once
more we whisper, “ Beware of ‘ snaix I ’ ’’
The following specimen of noble and lofty bunkum
was perpetrated by W. A. M’Arthur, M.P.,
from England, oa a recent occasion, when a
number of Sydney citizens ate more than was
good for them in the local Town Hall in order to
show that they regarded him ai a man and a
brother: —
He need hardly say that he was a firm believer in the
English race. It had spread over the world, carrying with it
everywhere the indestructible principles of righteousness.
■He meant that it had earned everywhere the love of truth
and the words of peace. Of such a nation we did well to be
proud.
The indestructible principle of righteousness is
original and good, but there is an awkward com-
mentary on it in the advertisement which so fre-
quently turns up in the Indian papers : “No
Christian need apply.” Too much of the Inde-
structible spirit of righteousness has made the
converted Asiatic a drunkard and a sot, and it
and the “ words of peace ” combined have paved
the earth with human bones. As regards the
missionaries who bear the “ indestructible ” article
and the other thing, they live in two-storey houses
on the shores of coral isles, and the country for
half a mile round is littered with empty cham-
pagne-bottles, while the shepherd inside is either
trading in copra, or messing with politics, or
maundering to a dark congregation, whom the
white man’s bright example has reduced to a con-
stant state of Me. that Town Hall banquet was
a good feed thrown away.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Vice-regal Tear of Sympathy.
Messrs. Anthony Hordern and Son have received the
following telegram from Mr. E. W aldington, private
secretary:—" His Excellency and Lady Oarington muoh
regret to hear of loss sustained, and heartily sympathise with
you.”—Sydney Daily Paper.
The great Imperial Federation conspiracy, new
evidences of which come to light every day, is a
deep-laid scheme by which Australia is to ba made
directly subject to England and England’s foreign
Queen. This lady, in the words of a small boy,
who, some six months ago, rose to a pinnacle of
undying literary fame, is always “very sorry
when there is an accident in the coal-mines,” and
as a dispenser of sympathy unaccompanied by
cash she stands unrivalled among the crowned
heads of Europe. Governor Carington, as her
deputy, and as the reflection of her royal charity
and condescension, is, therefore, required to have
the tear of sensibility always on hand, but be
overdid the work from the first until he made
himself dirt feheap. In the early days of his
reign he grieved much and often over widows of
labouring men killed in the interests of capital,
youthful boxers, kickers, aod bruisers, maimed in
the glorious cause of sport, and other sufferers
who were unused to such emotion, and for a time
theeffectwas all that could be wished. England had
sent out a Governor who cou l d weep a bucketful
whenever occasion demanded, and It was taken
for granted that whatever cause such a sympa - -
thetlc peer represented was necessarily a noble
and generous one. His tears propped up the in-
terests of Imperial Federation just as the straight-
ness of NicholasNickleby’s legs cast a temporary
halo over Dotheboys Hall. Bub when Lord Car-
ington becomes an incarnation of bathos weeping
amid the mins of a millionaire's bedding-factory
the effect is spoiled ; and, worse still, he gives
himself away as the old Tory woi shipper of “ pro-
putty ” instead of the whole-souled friend cf the
suffering and needy which many had hitherto
imagined him to be. His sorrow, when he lets it)
loose in thisunguarded moment, is for thecapitalist
who wasn’t insured so well as he might have
been, instead of for the unfortunate workmen who
have been thrown out of employment, ar d whose
wives and families will suffer in common with
themselves by the disaster which has befallen
them. For them there is no compensation, but
the wealthy bosses have the consolation of know-
ing that the “private” telegram of sympathy
which has been so opportunely made public will
serve as a good advertisement, and wil repay them
at least tenfold for anything they have lost.
Other capitalists, too, will keep the precedent in
sight, and when the labourer’s dray on which the
Abigail “ bank ” has advanced a 1 rifle at 200
per shenb and a Hiding scale of commission
is unhappily conflagrated, there will ba more
sympathy—for the afflicted three-ball show,
which will help that down-trodden institution to
bear up under its sorrows. In 1884, Lord Caring-
ton sat on a Royal Commission to consider the
housing of the working-classes of England, but
the hideous panorama of human woe which then
passed before his gaze seems to have done nothing
to convince him that the misery of the poor is of
more account than a small loss in a rich man s
bedding-factory. His brain is not built to grasp a
big principle. He postponed a ball out of respecb
to the feelings of “sassiety" at the time of the
j adlclal murder of four wretched boys, but he
insulted the representative intellect of the colony
when it came to plead for a commutation of that
hideous death-sentence, by ignoring its arguments
and reading in reply a paper which had been evi-
dently inspired hours before by the ex-Attorney-
General of Yandemonla, and which had as muoh
relevancy to the pleas advanced as the Chinese
Emperor’s heal! h has to the Australian rabbit-
plague. For once he found himself out of the
beaten track of deputy-grief, and he collapsed.
And the collapse was so woeful that we may ba
excused for presuming that even his grief is not
his own—that he has been simply sent out with
instructions to represent the “sympathetic" and
washy side of the Tory policy ; and after being
selected as the best available man to discharge a
duty which only requires a secretary and a few
telegraph-forms, he has achieved nothing but
failure. It requires intellect even to be Pre-
eminent in Grief.
The Extinct Volcanoes.
Twelve more empty craters are to be added to
the already long row of extinct volcanoes in the
New South Wales Upper House. Out of the sixty
harmless and ladylike persons who drag out a
vegetable existence in that solemn Chamber and
amuse themselves in their old age by making laws
for a young nation, nearly halt have succumbed
to weariteiH and mental collapse, and have practi-
cally disappeared from the stage, and consequently
It has become a matter of difficulty to raise a
quorum when the nominees assemble to wheeze
and groan over the too great velocity of the age.
The venerable dullards were growing dally scarcer
and more somnolent, and it was therefore con-
sidered necessary, according to Sir Henry
Parkes, to rouse them up by an infusion of fresh
blood and fresh vigour. For this reason it has
been resolved to shoot into the Upper Sarcophagus
a Judge, who has retired from the Bench because
feebleness and age have rendered him inrap
able of further service; seven political
failures who, being pronounced net sufficiently
intelligent to occupy seats in the Assembly for a
limited period while in their prime, are, therefore,
to sib in the Council for life and inflict the dregs
of their existence on the nation which rejected
them ; and four unknown individuals whose ap-
pointments will ever remain a mystery. Hitherto
there has been an unwritten law in New South
Wales which has pi evented the appointment of
new Councillors daring the Parliamentary session
lest it should be supposed that they had been sent
into the House for the purpose of swamping op-
position to some measure then in progress, but
Parkes, who has already overridden so many
precedents, has disregarded this one also. It will
probably be found, therefore, that the new cargo
of infirmity, incapacity, and old age, which has
been engaged to shore up a tottering legislative
generation is prepared to vote straight on the
Bill for stealing the name of the Continent, or on
some other lurid idiocy now before the public. If
the new members fail to do this there is no excuse
for their existence. New South Wales
does not want them —in fact it does
not want the Council at all, and the pas-
sive continuance of that dreary corporation
is in itself a disgrace to a Democratic country
and an insult to a Democratic system. Some
years ago the nation shook off the legislative in-
cubus of John Davies, C.M.G., with scorn and
digust, and yet the rotten system of New
South Wales’ government enables Parkes,
with one stroke of his pen, to inflict this
political outcast upon the country for
the term of his natural life, and make
him one of the 69 emperors of Botany Bay
Under the same system, Parkes ouull, if fie
chose, make a released conv o. or a no^orioui
criminal one of the bosses of the land, and yet, in
the face of this, New South Wales boasts that it
is ruled by the voice of the people. In reality, the
country is at the mercy of an oligarchy without
brains, and the only safety lies in the senility of
its oligarchs. In politics New South Wales emu-
lates the Dahomaa tribes, who worship
a snake, but, happily, in the present in-
stance, the reptile is dead and stuffed, and some
day, possibly, it may dawn on the people that the
stuffed animal might as well be thrown away.
Pressure of public necessity requires that the
Upper House should have neither opinions nor
sense. The Assembly, in its changes, reflects the
ever-changing sentiment of the nation, and the
Council, whose personnel does not change, is in-
variably compelled, sooner or later, to follow the
popular Chamber. It voted for semi-Protection
with Jennings, and for avowed Freetrade with
Parkes ; it votes, after a few feeble efforts at re-
sistance, for anything and everything ; and a
Chamber which is not allowed to possess either an
intellect or a soul is not a part of the body politic,
but merely a disease which has grown into its
vitals. The country tolerates the existence of the
Council from force of habit, but, taught by ex-
perience, it maintains the Assembly to squash it
whenever it attempts to speak—in other words, it
buys an expensive madman and hires a keeper to
suppress him. The system is both costly and ir-
rational, and the time cannot be far off when the
nation will resolve to dispense with the madman
and employ the keeper on some more profitable
work.
Tho Case of Monsieur Gabriel.
It will be remembered that on last Boxing Day
the poor, soft-brained wretch, August Gabriel,
was to have received 15 lashes for an offence tne
dfs'gnation cf which upon the charge sheet was
prima facie evidence of the man’s insanity.
Notices of appeal were, however, served upon the
lock-up keeper, and as, under the New South
Wales Criminal Law Amendment Act, section
147, it is provided that floggings shall be inflicted
during the term of the imprisonment awarded,
which is to be not less than 6 or more than 96
hours, the flogging in this case will probably not
be administered. It is worthy of remark, how-
ever, that this is in no way the fault of the spirit,
but a flaw in the technical administration of the
law. In this case, also, one or two observations
regardir g the arbitrariness of the law by which
he was to have been punished, are worthy of
serious consideration lha code under which he
was to have suffered was manufactured during
the convict days of the past, by a convict-time At-
torney-General, who was afterwards Chief Jus. ice
of New South Wales, and whose son is at present a
Supreme Court Judge in that colony. Moreover,
Gabriel’s case was presided over by a convict
time ex-squatter, who, as chairman of the Bench,
informed the prisoner that, were it not for bis
counsel’s eloquent appeal, he should have had 30 in-
stead of 15 lashes. Does this mean that punish-
ment is awarded not to crime U'*' the lack of
eloquence in counsel 2 If tne law provides a cef
tain punishment for a certain offence, why is that
punishment not administered 2 Probably, had
prisoner's counsel been a little more eloquent his
client would have got off wi' h only a round dozen
and a further display of eloquence would have
faved hij man completely. This opens up a new
field of income to well-developed legal eloquence.
Tne barristers who cannot elocute are to be com-
miserated deeply. But if not 15 why 30 2 Is
there a special virtue in 30 lashes— a special deter-
rent effect —and will 15 lashes deter only half as
much ? Or, did the magic pumber come down on
the goldens ream of time from our convict past also,
with the raft-load of judges and attorneys and
leg-iron-written laws ? Why not 50 2 Was that
not the magic number of the past ? Have 20
lashes been knocked off the true deterrent num-
ber in deference to public opinion, and if so, is
not the whole thing something like a gibbering
farce 2
Freetrade in Sewage.
The eloquent aspect of sewage and the true in-
wardness of the matter which makes the cabbage
sprout were dealt with at some length by the
Sydney Evening News last week, and various
new lights v» era thrown on a malodorous subject.
For Instance:—
A dose quite as fatal to Protectionists as “ Rough on
Rata” to a suicide is a fact which shows the successful estab-
lishment of any industry or enterprise without the aid of
Customs-house assistance. The freetrade theory is that
what a country can produce she will produce at the right
time, and that when she takes the work in hand, the in-
genuity and inventive powers of her people, developed by
competition, will enable her to hold her own against outside
competition, especially when handicapped by distance.
Some harmless individual, it appears, has estab-
lished a factory at Johnstone’s Bay (Sydney), in
which the decaying cabbage and the late goat are
disinfected and turned into inoffensive fertilisers,
and it is this seemingly simple circumstance
which has excited the News' rooster, and made it
crow. The factory in question has been estab-
lished “without the aid of Customs-house assist-
ance,” though how Customs-house assistance
could increase the flow of sewage or make it
smell worse than it d:d before, or how Freetrade
could have helped in the establishment of sewer-
age-works, seeing that the sewage was there all
the same, no matter what the tariff might be, are
questions on which no light is thrown. “ The
Freetrade theory is that what a country can pro-
duce she will produce at the right time,” and
when the right time came. New South Wales pro-
duced sewage and hadn’t any place to put io. She
also produced it at the wrong time, and in the
wrong place, for 100 years or so, but that doesn’t
count as an argument in favour of Protection,
though the fact of her producing it at lastatthe right
time does count, it seems, on behalf of Freetrade.
This same blessed policy, it would appear, has
enabled the colony “ to hold her own against out-
side competition, especially when handicapped by
distance," though where in thunder Bennett
ever heard of outside competition in sewage, or
how distant sewage is affected by Parkes’ new
tariff, or where the Protectionist ever lived who
wanted to protect sewage, are dark and solemn
mysteries. New South Wales, however, can
“ hold her own,” which, we presume, means
that she can produce as much sewage
as any effete nation groaning beneath the horrors
of Protection. She has done it for a century
already, and has thrown it anywhere—into Sydney
Harbour, into the ocean, into rivers, swamps,
lakes, disused mines, and the like, and even now
the drainage of Sydney is breeding a Centennial
pestilence on the flats near Cook's River, and, as
the News points out with pride, this great in-
dustry in slinging garbage has grown up without
any artificial support from a vicious system of
Protection. Protected countries have sewage
also, but they are enslaved and hampered by a
hideous Custom-house system, and are too spirit-
broken to shy it about in the airy fashion of the
New South Wales Freetrader. Also, protected
countries have sewage works—in fact the News
builds its eulogium of the Johnstone’s Bay estab-
lishment on the fact that it is “ unsurpassed by
any simil r works in tne United States,” from
which it appears that tte Land of Commercial
Freedom is only just making a feeble effort to get
on a level with a country where the slush is
blasted by Protection and kept down by the tra-
ditions of the effete past. All of which—we
quote once more from the Evening Bennett—
Points to the one fact, that where there are brains and
enterprise, there need not b- a Customs* wall—a barrier
used, to shelter weak men from the withering blast of com
petition.
To which we reply in a heartbroken sorb of way,
JuBb 80 -’’ Lot the withering blast of competi-
tion blow on the sewage if it wants to. We won’t
do anything to hinder it. We don t take the
same interest in the subject as the News, and, for
all we care, the whole stock of garbage may bo
crushed for want of “brains and enterprise ” as
soon as it likes. The sewage isn’t our brother,
anyhow, however closely id may be related to the
paper with the baby-for-sale advertisements, and
we have no desire to worry about it.
Ih. > Tiibe of Mary Jane Hicks.
It is exactly one year since the Moloch ol the
New South Wales Criminal Code was placated by
four youngsters, sacrificed as a blood-offering at
an earjy hour in the sunlit morning of last
January, and the se.f-styled philosophic Press of
Sydney confidently predicted that the people of
Australia had seen and heard the last of forceful
violation. Yet the other day, in Newtown, Miss
Ada Peel, highly-respectable domestic servant,
held a hat from which four men drew lots for
precedence for the privilege of pollution—if such
a word can be used in such a connection—and
when disturbed by a policeman, promptly followt d
the example of Miss Mary Jane Hicks, and
laid an information against her “ brutal
ravishers.” It was only a short time after
the Mount Rennie occurrence that a girl
of fifteen somewhere in the vicinity of the town
of Bathurst, boasted of her endurance of the
assaults of seven men in succession, and almost
immediately a fine mushroom crop of “ outrages "
sprang up throughout the colony cf New South
Wales, and notwithstanding that all these cases
fell through, not one of the interesting young
ladies concerned was arrested for 'perjury. Al-
most simultaneously with Parkes’ proposals for
the extension of the franchise to women we have
the facts evidenced by recent trials that we do not
punish crime in women purely on the grounds of
sexual consideration, If the sexes are really and
truly equal let them be equal on the gallows, in
the gaol, and at the triangles. If we really intend
to punish crime by hanging or flogging,
why should we let escape the woman who
poisons her husband, or the wanton little repro-
bate who is clearly proved in evidence to
be ‘' forty times worse than the men 2 ”
Let us not hear in future of charming young
ladies, who, with the assistance of brutal laws,
brainless Governors, ferocious Judges, and de-
graded juries, bred In a colony with a convict
past, manage to secure the hanging of a batch of
babies, after criminal trials so disgracefully con-
ducted that they should make men hesitate to
can themooives Australians. In the face of the
evidence disclosed in the recent c«e of that
charming—albeit unwlnged—angel Ada Peel, let
us not hear any more about the impossibility of
anot er Mount Rennie outrage occuning. In the
name of whatever we pretend to worship, let
us not assume that feminine virtue is a
physiological attribute. Let as not again
hear of a crowd of well-dressed noodles gathering
at Government House, and, by their advocacy of
the cause of Miss Mary Jane Hicks, putting
their wives, their daughters, their sisters, and
their mothers—presumably virtuous women—
upon the same level as the professional prostitute.
If we really mean to apply the deterrent influence
of the “cat,” let us triangle the wanton jades who
trade upon the sensational eroticism cf an hys-
terical public, and hand over the perjured
Phryne to Warder Troke,

Canon UAlton, who shepherded those Royal
lambs— Albert Victor and George— on their
voyage round the world, has contributed a paper for
the approval of the Colonial Institute. And, in his
precious paper, this small-bore Canon informs us
that England “piled up her 800 millions of debt
in order to acquire her colonies.” This is one of
those impudent Imperial falsehoods which the
Colonial Institute delights to spread abroad
through the agency of an approving Press. The
old fossils who read io in the Times say, “By
gad 1 sir, out of common gratitude to the mother-
country, the colonies are bound to stand by her,
sir. It makes my blood boil when people talk to
me of difficulties in the way of Imperial Federa-
tion. If it hadn’t been for the d d colonies,
England wouldn’t have a National Debt, and we
shouldn’t be paying that cursed Income Tax, yer-
know.” So they maunder on, in club-house
smoking-rooms and at Belgravian dinner-parties
when the duchesses and countesses have retired to
discuss the Royal Family and other great poll ioal
questions. Your true British Tory chooses to koow
nothing of the history of the Empire of whica he
is eternally prattling, and nobody better under-
stands the depth of this wilful ignorance than
fashionable clerics like Dalton. Therefore, he felt
himself on safe ground in addressing such a body
as the Colonial Institute, comprised of men sworn
to preach the unholy gospel of Federation and not
particular about what yarns they shove into us
benighted heathen. But we must respectfully re-
mind Dalton that Captain Cook didn't charge the
dear old Meitner Country one red cent for acquir-
ing Australia, nor did William Penn receive a
heavy subsidy for collaring the red man s heritage.
India was “ run ” (at a fine profit) by a private
company, until dear old Britain found it good
enough to take over, and a good many odd islands
have been sneaked by missionaries at a small ex-
pense in rum and tracts. In point of fact, Eng-
land piled up more debt In the process of losing
America and keeping India than she ever spent in
acquiring all these possessions which have not yet
attempted to throw off the yoke.
♦-
Here is an interesting little fact for the servile
polidcians who voted for the New South Wales
Defenca Bill. During the last war in South
America the Chilians purchased a fast-steaming
Irish pig-boat, and put into it one huge gun for
its sole armament. This weapon could carry t hells
8000 yards, and armed with it the ex-pig-carrier
bombarded and all but wrecked the towns alotg
the Peruvian coast, and even disabled an iron-
clad, while herself safely out of the range of
the Peruvian batteries. If the same craft, with
its solitary gun, were to visit Australia it could
skim round every high-priced British war-vessel
in these seas, and sink the bottomless cripples
which the Admiralty are so anxious to hire out to
the colonies one by one, and having done this it
could bombard Melbourne and t-ydney at its
leisure. Australia is to pay some £125,000 per an-
num for the privilege of being at the mercy of
Chili and its mean little pig-boat, and, in vie w o t this,
we would suggest that it might come cheaper in
the end to throw the gilded British figure-head
out on its ear, and let each cooey have a pig-
boat of its own.


HISTORY OF BOTANY BAY.
The convicb who descended into the hold
of a prison-ship, at an English port, from nine to
fifteen months bofore—and who completed the
voyage alive I—ln many oases never came on deck
again, or saw the sky and sea, until the ship
passed the Heads at Port Jackson, On some ships
they were allowed on deck in relays, but the
merest suspicion Of an attempt at mutiny whs
often alleged as a pretext to deny this concession
The co’aviot had no protector, and no parson’s in-
fluence stood between him and his fellow-creature
Who saw a ohanoa of saving sixp enoe a day by his
death from fever and starya tlon. This may seem
an exaggerated way of statl ng the case ; but the
reports of the Committees of the House of Com-
mons, from which thii writer draws his informa-
tion, are still extant, and open for reference,
• * *
The sight that graetei tha felon s eye was
nob a ra-assuring one. It may be taken for
granted that the study and pursuit of an arduous
profession—the cracking of cribs and the picking
of patent looks is not an intuitive aooomplisnment
—had left him little time to cultivate an eye for
the merely picturesque. It is, therefore, probable
that the natural beauties of Sydney Harbour were
lost on him. Bub the landscape held other
features. Dr. White, the Sydney surgeon, has
already limned some of its characteristics for us
iia fe w graphic touches. Floating corpses of the
hundreds who had died on the prison-ships, and
ware thrown overboard in the harbour when the
holds were cleared, lent a charm of their own to
the bright waters of the bay. Moored do e in to
the shores of Neutral Bay, the convict just
brought on deck might see the naked bodies of his
comrades, as the surgeon has told us, lying upon
the rocks. The sharks and the gulls held revelry
t ogethe: on these carcases of outcasts. But there
is another feature in the landscape,
* * *
As the convLt ship cams down the har-
bour at about the ead of tha last and the beginning
of the present century, one ghastly object me i the
view and stamped its repu’sive characteristics on
the new cauntry whose granitic water gates had
just been passed. Full In the sh’p’s fairway, and
just before reaching one point that intercepted the
straggling buildings of the infant settlement from
the view, there rose straight out from the water a
rertaln rocky crag. This was Pinchgut - so-called
bv those who affected plain Saxon spseoh, because
ihs convict wno broke the regulations was sent
’.here and exposed to the weather by day and
n’ght on bread and water until the caprice of hit
irresponsible torturers was gratified. Five men
were thus kspt here on one occasion for three
months Sometimes the convict
lo swim across to the northern e hore! *aud V
escape into tha bush. Stories dj e told of the effi
ciency of the sentinels—Aae sharks, whic
swarmed about the Httlej iq and . The fact tha
the convict was sometime, s9 'z 3 d a nd devourec
by these vigilant a3 he made his deapt rat
bid for life and only lent a piquant ze.t t
the Thera was a bond of sympathy
between thq s hark an I the gaoler, Oa the
summit the crag was a gibbet, and here th
skeleton 0 f a mur derar swung tn the win I, clank
ihg.e chains to every breeze that blew. Thi
dismal sight, as it Was probably the last he saw
on English soil—in one of Hogarth’s pictures yo
see an example of the custom that obtained o
hanging malefactors in chains by the sea shore—
waa likewise the first that greeted the outcast’
eyes as he once more touched land under th
English flag. It was a familiar objsob, this disma
scarecrow of civilisation. And the unclean thing
doubtless communicated to the observant oonvlc ;
a home like and domestic feeling, and sho wed him
that his comforts had not bean unforeseen or un
provided for in the strange la ad th-.t
had designed for him.
* * *
The skeleton was that of a cooper namec
Morgan. He held crude views as to the rights o
property, and he attempted to investigate tha
economic problem and a colonist’s skull at the
same time H iwever, this untutored cooper did
not investigate by the aid of legitimately appli
cable principles, He used an adze. A boat tha
went one day to the North Shire for wood, says
the thief-catcher Barring lon, brought back
man’s hat with blood on it. Further search dls
covered a bidy. This good cooper was one o
eight men sentenced to death for divers offence’,
and, by way of lending special eilat to the pro-
ceedings in his case, he was hanged on a high
gallows on Pinohgot rock. In thoie days, and for
many a long year after, it was tne custom for the
gibbetted criminal to devise a last dying speech
and confession to his testamentary legatees. As
Mr. Morgan was hoisted into the balmy air, and
the virginal loveliness of the surrounding
scenery burst upon him in all the magic of its
native charm, that respectable cooper gave ex
pression to the responsive harmony within his
soul in certain memorable words. “ You have
here, indeed, a beautiful harbour! ” said this
excellent man, as he was upset into eternity. The
observation has become historical, and has been
repeated with enthusiasm and received with
exubsrant effusion by all who love their country
ever since.
* * •
“ Morgan was ordered to be hung in
chains on the Maid Mat-te-wan ye,” runs the
story. “ This spectacle, shocking to the redned
mind”—it Is Barrington, the pickpocket turned
thief-catcher, who is speaking now—“ served as
an object of ridicule to the convicts and terror to
the natives, wno, though hitherto pirtlcularly
partial to that spot, now totally abandoned it.”
This is tha second glaring instance of the effect of
advanced British customs 01 the ravage mind.
We have seen already how the flogging of a white
man moved them to anger and to fears ; now we
find them disgusted at the spsetae’e of a male-
factor hanging in chains. There is evidently
something repellant to the sava re mind in both
the rope and the lasb. It is only under a high-
pressure civilisation, where tha righ s of property
arc understood and maintained, that these ad-
juncts of order and law—so shocking to the re-
fined mind, as this mawkish thief-catcher would
say-beoome thoroughly appreciated and intelli-
gently used. Morgan was hanged in 1796 ;in
1800, Hult, who arrived then, describes a skele-
ton in chains as one of the first objects that met
his eye. It would be a nice question to discuss
Who was responsible for this desecration of our
beautiful harbour ? Not the murdered man, he
certainly had no voice in the matter. Clearly not
Mr. Morgan, he, in his modesty, would have been
satlsdad to hang anywhere. Tha blame Is at the
doors of the authorities of the time, who, surfeited
with executions and floggings, which doubtless
palled on hfir appetites f r these horrors, oapri-
cions’!/ directed the hanging of Lhla wretch on
Plnohgut Rock aa a pleasant variation from the
beaten track pursued in these cases.

Many years after, Dr. Lang complained
bitterly when Governor Denison hewed this rook
away and erected hia gingerbread fortifications
there. It was removing an old land-mark, walled
the Doctor, and effacing a picturesque feature of
the landscape. He was right. Yet, for these very
reasons, it would have been better had a few
ounces of melanite done the business, and blaster
the crag and its foul associations for ever out o:
existence and out of memory. But it a com
mencement were once made in this way. Where
could we consistently stop before we had blown
the Whole seaboard of tha colony into the sea
While such associations remain it Is not to b
wondered at that the people of Sydney continue
to be proud of their historically beautiful harbour.
* * *
When the hold had been cleared, the con
vlcts unchained, and the corpses thrown over
board, those who survived were ranged up in
three lines on deck. The convict-ship was sur
rounded by a fleet of boats, packed with pardonec
pick-pockets eager to welcome their newly-anived
acquaintances. No one was allowed on board.
A boat approached too closely to the ship that
carried Holt, and was challenged by the sentinel.
The rowers did not move away as quickly as the
sentinel desired. “He levelled his musket, anc
fired,” says Holt; “ the ball passed through the
arm and then the body of a young man, who in-
stantly expired. When I got on shore, I heard
that this man bora a good character ; the mur-
derer was brought on shore, tried for wll r ul mur-
der, and acquitted- But, to save him from the
vengeance of the people, he was sent to Norfolk
Island, where Divine vengeance followed him, for
I saw him with a deformed frams and covered
with vermin.” The ship was now visited by Cap-
tain Johnstone and other officers, with privileged
spectators. Captain Johnstone read from the in-
dent the name of every convict, offence, sentence,
and place of conviction. Those whose trades or
professions made them of public use were claimed
by the Government Then the officers of the New
South Wales Co "ps had their choice. The rest
were scrambled for by the iuhabl'ante, according
to their position or influence.

cure the Governor’s permission to take to them-
selves a female convict ” Thus was the Scriptural
injunction to increase and multiply obeyed, Yet
it is significant that it was those convicts only
who had realized some property who were enabled
to “ procure” the Governor’s permission to fol'ow
the Mosaic coucsel, and thus enable their descend-
ants to beast with realistic truth of their “ ances-
tors by uu'charo. ’ But, after this process of selec
tion had been gone through, there was still a re-
jected residuum left. Lieutenant Bond has no
scruple in telling us how the autho l ies disposed of
them “ The remainder, who are not thus chosen
are brought on shore and have small huts assigned
them ; but, through the want of seme regular
employment, are generally concerned in every
artifice and villainy which is committed.” Then
follows a sentence which, to have its full signifi-
cance, must be read beside what has been said of
the officers cf the *’ rum-selling corps.” “ Females
of this description,” it runs, “are usually em-
ployed in selling such cargoes of ships as are pur-
chased by the officers.” This unholy partnership
bore its appropriate fruit in the disorders, the
outrages both illegal and legalised, and the
wholesale executions of this squalid time.
* * *
So the convict population entered upon
ts inheritance. There is a weird story told by an
old writer, in which he describes how a dead
man regains consciousness beyond the Acheron,
and meets again in the world of shades
fhe forms of those whom he knew in life, and
from whom he thought he had parted for ever.
Some of the most dramatic passages in Dante’s
“Inferno ” are desciiptive of his meeting with the
damned souls of his Florentine acquaintances in
the Malebolge pool. The position of the newly-
arrived convict was not d'ssimilar. It is a dismal
parallel. Dead, and judicially damned by the
savage laws at home—there were over 300 capital
offences at the beginning of the century—he re-
gained consciousness after his long Styx-like
voyage to be in time for his re-awakening in hell.
The tortures were there, and the damned. One
of the first men Holt saw on his arrival was a
man whom he raw tried, and on whom he had
heard passed the awful sentence of death. Such
encounters were frequent. It was an eerie world)
peopled with criminal ghosts. The one thing
needful was the attendant demons. But the
New South Wales Corps was there, so that the
demons were never missed.

(London correspondence)
If one might sum up thsL. events of tha week in a line, it
would be to say that the Government are doing better of
late, and makirg considerable headway against the forces cf
sedition and disorder. Pity it is that they should be handi-
capped y the tviden e of such rack-renting as has obviously
gone on on the est >t-s of Colonel Tottenham and others
in Limerick and Tipperary. Here a gross rental of £3OOO
a-year has been cut down by the commissioners to £lBOO, or
a r Aker ion of 40 per cent. One of Colonel Tottenham s
tenants, raying £lB a-jear, has got his rent reduced to £2 5s
And yet fhe poor man paid regularly up to last pay d»y
Evidence of this kind would cripple the efforts of ths best
Government in tha world,
The Conssrvative papers try to show that riots
in Trtfalgar-square are like the Irish meetings,
nevertheless the starvation in Ireland is caused by
rentslike theabove. S arvation in Ed gland is caused
by want of work among the London masses.
True it i?, starvation is at the base of each. But
how different the proximat) causes of starvation,
unless, indeed, we atttibuti each to bad govern-
ment. Undsr good government no one need
starve on the surface of this globe at the present
day. An intelligent republic is better even than
an intelligent despotism. How much better,
then, is an intelligent republic than an
unintelligent monarchy, such ai we have now in
England ? And how many more murders are we
to have under the false Gospel of Law and Order
which is now being preached ? From every one
according to his abilities, to every one according
to hii wants -is the doctrine of modern Socialism.
“ Grab as grab who can ” is the social doctrine of
our present pasters (like Jeeferis) and masters.

The present writer never saw Dooley to
worse advantage than on Saturday night at
Foley's, when he contested eight rounds with
Costello, the ’Murkan. For the first couple ot
rounds Dooley appeared stage-struck, and Cos-
tello took a decided lead, but in the third round
the Sydneyite fought in something like his old
style and punished his man severely. From this
out Dooley had matters his own way, but Costello
was all there when corners were called for the
eighth round, and the [affair was declared a draw,
Dooley makes a mistake in being too eager to use
bis right. He is a left-handed fighter, with
which hand he is quick and a terrible punisher,
and had he played on Costello with it alone for
four or five rounds, he might have had a chance
of weakening ihe’Murkan sofliciently to get the
right on. Costello is no fighter, but his pluck
and agility make it a hard, matter to knock him
out.

As if to make amends for their Adelaide
muddle, the M.C.C. Englishmen gave a splendid
exhibition of plucky batting at Melbourne last
Saturday. They lost the first four wickets for 16
and six for 51. But, after luncheon—in exactly
three hours of actual play—the last four wickets
put on 219 runs. Such a performance is the more
remarkable, as English amateurs are notoriously
unreliable when a “funk” has been started, and
Vernon’s men deserve a little butter for upsetting
tradition. The way in which they “ tumbled ” to
Trott’s bowling, after he sent back four men for
10 runs, quite killed his chance of being Included
in the next Australian Eleven. Trotb lowered the
smallest Britishers—Peel and Abel—with conse-
cutive balls, but finished up the day with a poor
average, after all, the hitters gaining confidence
and punishing him as all “cunning” bowlers
(even the gieat Peate) are liable to be punched
on a fairly dry turf.

“Handand Glove,” a serio-corpaecomedy
filled with flying tea-things and other accessories,
was produced at Sydney Royal Standard on
S .turtfay in the presencx i f one situ 11 unfettered
bi y, and several bogus individuals who looked
loi-ecome in the vastness of the theatrical desert.
The piece bears internal evidence, in the first two
acts, of having been written by a naked dramatist
with an axe, while the third -o\ which is genuine
comedy, is weighed down the silent sarco-
phagus by the memory of what went before.
Messrs. Hand and Glove—private detectives and
general inquiry men, debts collected with
celerity and intelligence, missing friends and
lost dogs looked after—were admirably
played by Messrs. Hall and Arrowsmith,
and formed the only redeeming feature of
the drama. The other actors did a lot of gazing
at each other and spread out their legs in a de-
ranged way, which made the audience long to
run for a doctor and not get him in time; the
ladies, with the exception of Mrs. Melville, were
squeaky and fell over their own clothes; the
lawyer had apparently been boiled till he was
soft, and when the Colonel appeared on the scene
we went out to inform the authorities that some'
t hing had broken loose. Amid these surroundings,
the splendid comedy of Mr. Johnny Hall, and the
acting of Mr. Arrowsmith, who was only his
inferior by a shade, made us think of some-
thing the name of which we can’t recollect
just at the moment, that was cast before
whatsisname. On Monday night “ Hand and
Glove” gave place to “Across the Conti-
nent”—a melodrama which, in its awfulness,
would shake the morals of the virtuous kangaroo,
and make the wild emu, which feeis upon that
bounding marsnp’al on the a-id plains, curse 'hi
day it was born, as more folly described in the
eloquent language of Job. Everybody, except
Mr. Hall, talked in a roar and tiled to asssssina'e
somebody else over a mug of beer ; everybody
threw the furniture about and perspired, aud was
drunk ever afterwards ; everybody either kicked
a girl with a sweet voice in short petticoats,
or else rushed in to rescue her and made
a fool of himself, and the result was
sadder than a monkey writing a Jubilee ode. The
everlasting Hall, however, bore up amid all these
desperate surroundings and ran a xub. in a vein
of unspeakable comedy which kept his audience —
a tolerably large one—in a roar. Mr. Arrow-
smith, however, collapsed. He was oast for a
tragic downhill character with a spoiled ping-hat,
and he gave way under It. Any other man would
have done the same. Such a character, when
loaded on to a comedian, was like a piano hung
on a clothes-prop, and, after a gallant effort to
bear up, the prop naturally wont.

There is still a considerable crowd every
night at Sydney Academy, where Fred Maccatae
plays his lone hand with gratifying results. Now
and then he presumes a little on the supposed ig-
norance of an Australian audience, and relieves
his mind of a chestnut of no ordinary magnitude,
or a pun which would rend the soul of a jackass,
but his wandering minstrel from Shoreditch or
Whitechapel Dairies everything before him, espe-
cially when he commences to worry a tune in a
top-note which has deteriorated through much
sleeping in damp parks, accompanied by
such variations as the Indo-European race
never heard before. The “ waria ions,” as
he blandly explains, is a sort of thing “as has a
wild-cat fight with the toon, and I bets ten to one
on the warlatlcn.’' When his top-note—so called
from its resemblance to a cat on a chimney-top -
fails him the wandering minstrel “ cheeks it
hout,” and by these means he keeps himself sup-
plied with daily bread, though not with daily
boots. hhould misfortune ever come down on
him, Fred. Maccabe’s troubadour is good for £4
a week in coppers in King-street, Sydney, and we
are ready to go shares in the firm.

“Jack Sheppard” runs indefinitely at
Sydney Criterion. People who don’t know a B
flat note from a black ey e howl with glee in the
stalls; the tea hound, who makes his pile by sell-
ing us old brooms chopped up, and calling the
mixture orange pekoe, yells the tOlow out of him-
self in the circle ; and a hydra-headed multitude
fills the pit and gallery. The amount of brute
force which goes off in perspiration at the
Criterion in a week is sufficient for three rows in
the Assembly and one street fight, and there is
enough over to haul a tram-car from this office
to Tophet.

“ In the Ranks,” one of the most beautiful
examples we know of a muscular young man
being supported by his tottering old unole, will
progress for some time longer at Her Majesty’s
(Sydney). The secret of the popularity of this
drama lies in the fact that the most of mankind
never had an uncle. If they had, (hey would
know that the deceptive brother of their pa
generally boards with his nephew and scares away
all bis friends by the style in which he blows his
nose in a big red handkerchief, and ultimately
dies, leaving his wealth to be invested in stand-
up collars for the cannibals. At the present
moment there are 18 able-bodied men sleeping in
Sydney Domain by night and selling matches by
day, who might have gone into Parliament and
been Insolvent three times for large amounts if
they had never possessed a rich unc? j.

“Robinson Crusoe,” with the two monkeys
and the rest of the fixings, rages with consider-
able financial results at Sydney Royal. Also, at
the Gaiety, “The World Against Her" is well
attended, and the pathetio heroine who is banged
about on an empty stomach by the demon of dis-
cord, draws tears to the eyes of half the ladies in
the audience. Miss Dampier's Madge is a charm-
ing production, and after viewing it we lay our
red and battle-scarred nose in mournful tribute
upon the tomb of buried affection, and would fain
weep if it were not for our corns. We don’t weep
with our feet, of course, but ’the corns spoil the
flow of soul which used to be our most note-
woithy characteristic. Mr. Dampier announces
that “Faust" will be produced at the Gaiety
during the present season, and if this wonderful
work fails to draw crowded houses, we will re-
gretfully write the population of Sydney down

The Bondi Aquarium was densely crowded
on Monday, and fully 15,000 people parted with
their legal tender at the gates. In the rink, the
skateis were compelled to stand on top of each
other, and the excitement rose to a great height
when the Australian Blondin started to walk
from one cliff to the other upon a rope, but It
went down again when he arrived at the end of
his trip alive. Most people go to a show of this
kind with a lurking hope that somebody will be
killed. The evening closed with an illumination
and a variety entertainment.

Frank Clark, at Sydney Opera House,
has improved somewhat on his original programme.
Wilson and Cameron’s dummies are a consider-
able advance upon the howling waste of “The
Two Macks,” and Ouda has added a jump of 50
feet to his previous a»tempts to acquire sudden
death. The “Bald-beadedswell” is good, but rather
personal - our own hair isn’t what it used to be—
and Mdle. Garetta’s performances with her bevy
of pigeons are as pretty as they well can be. At
this point we stop with an apology and a promise
to be more explicit next week. The fact is that
we sent down an unreliable Anarchist to repre-
sent us at the Opera House, and have been basely
deceived. The Anarchist hasn’t turned up.

Judging by the overwhelming audience

Brough and Boucicault’s good-looking
company are wrestling with ‘ Sophia’ I —an in-
nocuous comedy founded upon “Tom Jones’
at Melbourne Bijou. Being a strictly modem
combination they haven’t quite clutched the
spirit of things as they were when Fielding wrote
the first English novel. What was wanting in
“ School for Scandal” is wanting now—a certain
breadth or length or depth, which history attri-
butes to our boozy forefathers. With this vague
exception “ Sophia ” is honestly dealt with at the
Bijou, The plot is old and simple—
Said the Squire to Sophia—
“ Tom Jones you may admire,
But I won't let that young liar
With my gal’s affections trifll;
I desire (said the Squire)
That you listen to your sire ;
As a husband you require.
Make a match with Mr. Blifll,”
The outcast Thomas goes to London with Barber
Partridge, Sophia leaves the Squire, and takes up
with Lady Bellaston (a forward minx who always
wears a low neck dress and feathers ia the vain
hope of sneaking Sophia’s young man), everybody
gets into a tangle, and the perfidious Blifll has
nearly done the job when a rostio “ bit of mus-
lin ” confounded his knavish tricks, and Sophia
takes Thomas with the Squire’s blessing. It is
worth noticing that the heroes of old comedies
never earn a cent, but get untold gold from
elderly friends to enable them to live and die in a
condition of luxurious matrimony. Tom Jones,
as plajed by Mr. Cecil Ward, is a miserable sort
of a cuss after they bid him shift for himself, and
yet he drops in for somebody’s big cheque. Mr.
Phil. Beck makes Blifll a cross between a curate
and an undertaker, while Mr. Boucicault’s Squire
Western inclines to the grotesque A game
Partridge is Mr. Titheradge ; the very soul of
Honour is in Miss Patti Brown’s representation
ot that volatile lady’s maid. All the minor parts
are neatly rounded off, and language falls to fur-
nish a notion of Miss Trevelyan as Lady Bellas-
ton, afnd Miss Boucioault in the name part. Their
beauty makes us glad

On Boxing Night, a gruesome Lagedy,
called “ Jack the Giant-Killer and Little Bo-
Peep,” was let loose at Melbourne Royal. The
author of this trjing complaint is Mr. Malfcby,
who is believed to have had special designs up. n
the dear children, judging from a rough diagnosis
of the symptoms. The plot of “Jack,” &c ,is
far-reaohing, and tends to Induce slumber on a
warm night, although everyone ought to be called
in time to catch the transformation scene—a sweet
piece of work entirely. Several popular per-
formers are doomed to appear in the opening, but
their genius is allowed to run Lo seed. A new
song-and-danoe divinity—Miss Frances Coventry
—is rather fresh and charming, and some live
lambs appeal to the squatter’s tenderest feelings.
Mr. John Gourlay does his level best in the harle-
quinade, which distinctly suggests something
comic every now and again. The Triumvirate
have set up this show in liberal style, and busi-
ness keeps big so far.

“ Erminie ” fills Melbourne Princess’s in
all weathers and shall have the causes of this

We would also give just cause or reason why the
fickle multitude continues to gloat over “ Current

unfathomable. Coghlll Bros, are gathering in
golden grain, and Silk Stockings include some
new and shapely legs. Bach of these shows is
real good goads of its kitd.

The London Bat goes in for sarcasm ;
It is officially stated that Miss Eastlake is not married. I
am sure I do not know who made the absurd announcement,
or who she was said to be married to. Such statements are
calculated to injure actresses in their profession, and I
should say that either party could recover damages.

to labour among the victuals and spread infection,
he ran amuck through the hash-house, and

The people of Hillston (N.S.W.) are
shortly to be blessed by Government with a new
stock roffle to Trids. The present track is almost
a straight line, covering some 60 miles of ground,
but the now and improved route goes backward
about 20 miles, and then dodges off about 35 miles
to the left; next it wobbles in a long slant of 25
miles or thereabouts, towards nowhere in par-
ticular, and finally it repents and does a straight
run of about 70 mile Jto its final destination. This
sort of thing amuses the inhabitants a good deal.
“ The remains of three different parties of
miners have been found in the Kimberley Ranges,”
says a Sydney daily paper. More than likely this
is true. Thanks to the false reports of unprin-
cipled, one horse power storekeepers, connived
at by large Australian mercantile Anns, and
steam boat companies, and backed by the endorse-
ment of a stupid or culpable Governor, many
hundreds of poor fellows were lured away from
good positions and comfortable homes in the
several colonies, to go to that land of fever,
scurvy, dysentery, and untimely death. In the
struggle for life there, it was not the ailments that
flesh is heir to which were the most ins’dious or
the most destructive to life. Man’s greatest
enemy was man himself. The barbed spear of the
blackfellow, and the revolver-bulled of he white
man, were powerful auxdiaries of King Death.
In the Northern territmy of S.A. the

The new Croydon (Q.) goldfield is the
chosen home of almost every biting, crawling
thing on earth. There the alligator wrestles for
pre-eminence with the humble bub attentive flea,
and the horse-stinger’s dreary anthem aggravates
the bull-dog ant, the Norfolk Howard, and the
sand-fly, while the blow-fly wheels its sorrowful
flighCto the putrefying dog, and the [leech lies in
wait in the muddy swamp, and the snake
walketh in darkness. Nature h»s left nothing
out that is calculated to swell up the greonhorn’s
head to three times its natural dimer sloes, and,
having thus got everything ready, she entrapped a
wild, fresh son of the sod named Jack Whalen,
and sent him up to wrestle with theso accumu-
lated horrors. He had a nice time cf it By day
he was a raging terror with a big stick, but at
night ho wrapped his head in cheem-cloths, and
alternately cursed and wept for his old home in
Macgllllcuddy’s mountains, lo became a
recognised fact at last, that the man
who wanted to wreak a fiendish revenge on Jack
Whalen had only to persuade him to come out
ofjhis cheese-cloths after dark, and one e vil mlndi d
wretch ultimately did it. At midnight's solemn
hour an unknown voice told Ireland’s wandering
child that his mate was being kilt entirely in the
gully, and three shadowy forms gave way to sup-
pressed laughter as they saw the deluded stranger
tear across the hill with nothing on him but a
shirt and a club. Then they stole the cheese
cloths and retired. Down in the gully, mean-
while, Jack searched for an hour, while ac-
cumulated evils preyed upon his legs, and finally
he came back to find that his impromptu mosquito-
curtains were gone The scene closes with a
tremendously swollen Irishman wandering round
wid a bit of a shtlck.
Charitable people who have parted so
much ot their legal tender for the Queen’s Fund,

Mr. Plggott was one of the chief founders c£ the
Liberal party in Victoria, and, in company with
Chief Justice Higinbotham, and Messrs. M‘Cnl-
loch, Yerdon, and Michia, he took a leading p»rb
in the Conference at Melbourne which did so much
to shape the policy of the Southern colony. He
afterwards came to New South Wales as
the champion of the Joachims, who claimed
the right of the mining community to select land,
against Sir John O'Shanassy and Sir James
Martin, and raised funds for the famous appeal to
the Privy Council which ended in the overthrow
of the squatting party In later years, Mr. Plggott
held a position in the N.S W, Railway Department,
which he quitted to join the staff of the Wagga
Wagga Advertiser. He was a member oi iheSelec-
tors' Conference which was largely instrumental in
overturning the corrupt Land Act of 1861,
and did much good service to N.S. W. in other
directions. Two years ago, however, he was
attacked by fever at Cairns (Q.), and became hope-
lessly blind. Mr. Plggott and his young family
are now in Sydney, helpless and utterly desdtute,
all their small belongings having b en sold o buy
food, and an appeal is made for assistance to one

We did not like to sadden a damp yet
would-be jovial Christmas by this tale of tragedy
so we held it over until now. And now it mns
come out or we will explode. A curs 3 on to the
head of the man who first invented Christmas
picnics. Another end an especially hot curse on
the individual who first designated Christmas
a “ festive” season, when ho knew all the time
that it was about as festive as the open smile of a
skeleton. Ten years ago wa went to one of these
deceiving entertainments in the far and arid
North, where the sun tends strictly to business in
the dog-days, and where every dog has his day,
and very few of the days are fit for a dog to be
out in. A listless party sat round on the sands
and on some bull-ants. We were not then the
elevated individual wa have since become, and we
sat with the rest to wolf the ham and drink tea
out of pannikins Then we discovered that
there was no water, and, consequently, there
could be no tea. So the ham was eaten dry, and,
when it was disposed of, ten individuals, each
with his tongue hanging out of his mouth, went
forth to look for water. Among us, we covered
an aggregate distance of 5i miles, and found not
so much as a drop, and an attempt to quench our
feelings by licking a gum-tree proved futile. So,
under a blazing aftsrnoon sun, our party tottered
home, and finished a festive Christmas clutching
the filter. Years have rolled on since then, but
we have never faced a picnic since, and we have
fixed up a large red affidavit that, unless there is
a Moses in the party to strike the rock, we never
will.

Neil Gordon M‘Intosh, late grave-digger
at St. Kilda (Melb ) Cemetery, was discovered
hanging from a tree in Albert Park. Temporary
insanity, brought on by business anxieties, we
suppose:—
The Crown Prince of Germany’s “ cancer ”
is assuming a comical appearance, after all. It
has looked angry, malignant, hopeless, and criti-
cal. Now it begins to look like a first-class pro-
fessional joke played upon a nervous patient and
his gullible old relatives. As Sir Morell Mac-
kenzie has been scooping the cream of the joke,
we must gently reprove that canny Scotchman :—
Box and Cox have come to life again in
London, and are swearing in the police court
f-gainsta lady whose front name is Eliza and
whose hind name is sometimes Box and some-
times Cox. Eliza, it appears, married Box, who
was employed on night-duty somewhere, leaving
home at o in the evening and returning at 7 a m.,
tndshe also became the happy bride of Cox,
whose hours of labour were from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.
She thought this was great fun at first, but she
soon found herself wretchedly deceived. She
spent the night with Cox, but the instant he went
out in the rrowning she had to get out of her com-
fortable b’d and fly through the cold dismal
streets to the residence of Box, where she had
half-an-hour to kindle the fire and get breakfast
ready. Then she had her housework to do, and
about noon she had to tear away again, leaving
Box wrappei in slumber and do more housework
and get Cox’s dinner ready. When that horny-
handed son of 101 l had returned to his emploj -
ment, and she bad washed up the dishes, it was
time for her to rush back to the other domicile
where the chances were that Box was prema-
turely awake and howling for his dinner,
and wanting to know “ wot she ’ad been
hout for I" and the miserable slave had
to pacify him and rake up another
meal. She had already eaten dinner with
Cox, but she had to eat another with Box to
allay suspicion, and she had also to take tea with
Box and then fly the moment his back was turned
to get tea ready for Cox. By this time the
wretched female jokut had run about seven miles
and was ready to drop, but she had to bear up
and have another tea with Cox, and sit with him
during the evening, and then at night she would
lie awake and draw fancy pictures of Box return-
ing unexpectedly and finding her not at home. On
Sundays both husbands were at homo during the
day though Box had to go out at night as usual,
and then the unhappy woman had to spend her
whole time in tearing backwards and forwards.
Twenty-five miles was the average distance which
she accomplished on the Day of R»st, and when
she wasn’t running she was explaining to one hus-
band that she had been out at Sunday-school, or to
the other that she had just returned from church,
and the evening generally closed by her being
soundly walloped by each of the deceived pair.
Box used a strap on these occasions, and while
she was still weeping from this Infliction Cox
would lay on to her with a long cane. Both of
them hit her in the same place, and, as a rule,
it was Wednesday before she could sit up straight,
Cox came home early, too, on Saturday after-
noons, and as she was necessarily away at that
time attending to the domestic wants of Box, and
could seldom invent a feasible excuse for her
absence, the chances were ten to one that another
breezy thrashing resulted, which left her in bad
case for the inevitable discipline of Scnday. She
had a double allowance of floors to scrub at d a
double lot of stockings to darn, and washing-day
came twice a week, and when she got ill she had
to tear round just the same, ss she had two
houses to be ill in, and yet dared not collapse and
rest in either. At last, when the had eaten about
350 more meals than she wanted, and had run, on
a low estimate, 2700 miles, she gave up, and told
TONSORIAL ARTIST (to little Sympkins, who is very proud of a very little scrubby moustache):
“I CAN GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO STOP THAT!”
Cox all. She explained that Box was her drat
love, and Cox, being a conscientious man, replied
that, in that case, Box was the only individual
who had a right to thrash her. He, therefore,
took her along with him, and explained matters,
and then Box whaled her till she could hardly
stand. This function being completed, they
jointly, severally, and individually called in a
policeman and gave her into custody, and each
started to do his own cooking for the future. As
for Eliza, she languishes in a dungeon, and It is
not yet decided what is to become of her. It is
the first rest she has had far seven months.

An important case came on for heating a
few days ago, before the over-worked beak at
Rockhampton (Q ). Is was a blazing hot morn-
ing ; the magistrate was drowsy, the policemen
slept standing and woke up convulsively at inter-
vals, the Archimedean lever dozed in its box, and
reached out during interludes of partial wakefulness
to make a note of something, and nobody could
understand the matter in dispute, which lay be-
tween a violent plaintiff and a bewildered foreign
defendant. The plaintiff was afflicted with a
hideous mumble, and, be ng sworn, he stated that
an unfathomable gyration had gone on between
him and the defendant, which nad ended in the
latter bull-headed son of a gun owing him the
Lord knows what, and then he triumphantly
handed over 16 sheets of paper covered with
assorted kitten-tracks and diro, and asked his
Worship to look at them. The dejected Bench
waded through them, and found they had no bear-
ing on the case, whereupon the plaintiff remarked
that perhaps he had made a mistake, and felt in
the purlieus of his pockets and the bowels of his
hat until he disentombed a rag of paper, which,
he said, contained the “ k’rekt account." I] was
even dirtier than the others, and looked as if it had
been filed away in a goat-stable and chewed up and
walked upon and then found and wiped by the
plaintiff on tae tall of ihe defendant’s coat, but in
the centre of it was a blob of dirt and a demand
in violent language for £l3 old, or he would make
the defendant's nose bleed, and there were foot-
marks round the edge. The magistrate read this
also and then tried vainly to explain that he
wanted particulars of the claim, but this only
made the plaintiff foam and exhibit contempt of
court, and finally the “ cadi ” fell back on the wild
foreign defendant who stuttered and wasn't on
speaking terms with the English language. This
gentleman stated, amid a cloud of battered parts
of speech, that he was remember of the plaintiff
so long as ever was, and was know of nothings
anywhere as to which it was possible that where
the plaintiff was or anybody else this day before
this honourable court in which he now appear.
Further, he thought that, in any case, wherefore he
hear that as was now, though why he couldn’t
say, as not speaky the language so well as more
so. But he was prepare to testifate that not any-
how was he or at any other time. He made these
statements to an Irish policeman, and kept his
back to the magistrate the while, so that if the
Bench wanted to take his coat-tails in its mouth
it could do so at any moment, and he grew
excited and frothed a good deal as he went on
When at last the beak got a word in edgeways
the pilgrim from a foreign strand produced
another dirty piece of paper from down his back,
and represented that it was the connecting link
between the hideous lie as which the plaintiffeer
did go away for to produce, and the real facts as
how they did complicate on the chawed-up invoice
already in the hands of this honourable gourt
So the court took the paper end gazed upon it. It
represented a hog seeing snakes after being
out late, and at the foot was a hieroglyphic in
some red foreign tongue, which, in the opinion
of the polyglot policeman attached to the estab-
lishment, read “ Mynheer von Dunk, he never got
drunk.” At this stage the case was indignantly
dismissed, but the defendant, who evidently
thought his property was at stake, continued to
give evidence in the box for five minutes more,
and when he was informed that he had won, and
a kindly policeman removed him outside he said
he would abbeal.” When last seen he was still
testifying in an informal manner on the pavement]
and showing his dirty piece of paper to casual
passers-by, to whom he stated that ho wanted
ohustica” the same as was got in Shernrainea as
which ha was grieve that he ever came away
from,

A joke was recently played on a N.S.W.
station-master which nearly led to a cold-blooded
and brutal assassination in the first degree. He
was away on business in a district that didn’t
know him from Adam, and was accompanied by
a friend who resided in tho locality. About lunch
time, the latter made for a station on the Mur-
rumbldgee, where he was received with rapture,
and the fatted calf, or some equally symbolical
specimen of meat, was slaughtered on his account,
but the manager was frozen out and treated with
scorn. Tho host viewed him with a cold, arro-
gant gaze, which hurt his feelings; he got the
scrag end of the fowl and the coldest potato, the
liquor, quite accidentally, wouldn't go round, and
he was lefo dry; nobody spoke to him, and the
ladies of the house regarded him with a super-
cilious eye, as it he were a boos-canvasser or a
quantity of stale tarts. On leaving, the flabby
flipper of friendship was effusively offered to bis
companion, while the manager’s salutation was
received with an icy grin, which seemed to say,
“ Take the animal away ! ’ “ Well, your friends
are dashed sociable,” said the aggravated victim
to his friend, whan they were once more on their
way. “I think a decent thief would have been
treated more civilly than I.” Then his friend
smiled wistfully, and said that it would have been
all right, only—for an experiment, don’t you
know, and not meaning any harm —he had told
their entertainers that the manager was the agent
of the Shearers’ Union. He was quite pleased
with the result, he said, but the manager became,,
dangerous for the rest of the day.
This overworked land of damps, blue
devils, and madness owes a debt of unfathomable
gratitude to the man who edits the Canterbury

unable to give his name, but if we ever meet h m
at sea and are both sick o rer the same rail— if we find
him holding forth drunk in a public-house with
his coat-tails oa fire —or if we should chanco to
come across him endeavouring vainly to get a pig
through a gate, or in any other difficulty, we shall
esteem it a privilege and an honour to give him
all the support our moral influence can confer, and
will back him up till he won’t know where he is.

Hope it would be deep and dry ?
How came it, Neil, you decided
Thus to quench the vital spark,
And of a sudden suicided

Could it be that you were haunted
By the people you had planted 3
Did grim goblins come complaining

Sure enough the “damp came through ?"
But something tells us this is bosh—

Harmless, then serious —

Is now a mere tumour,

cutting down religious pars to six lines.” The
last such paper in Brisbane expired despite an
heroic attempt to stir up a sensation by minute
details of the working of the C.D, Act.
PERSONAL ITEMS.
Mud gee Taylor has gone broke.
Premier Gillies received a deputation in
his shirt-sleeves. Parkes receives his deputations
with a cool front.
The Mayor of North Rockhampton (Q.)
is in trouble about £13,000 worth of alleged
forgeries. Apparently, he has cleaned out the
town.
Sir T. M‘ltwraith is credited with putting
on 200 men at the Reid’s Creek copper mines
which have just been floated at home. Copper
will pay at £B3.
The Duke of Manchester arrived in Bris-
bane on 220 d, and left on 23rd December. No
public notice whatever was taken of “His
Grace’s” visit. Bravo, Brisbane !
Jake Gaudaur can go one better than
Hanlan in the way of excusf s. He attributes his
de'eat by Teemer to incipient rheumatism, which
must have developed duticg the race.
“The Bishop of Ballarat has kissed the
Pope’s toe. At least the carlo calls it an
“audience.” What we would call it is that the
Pope has scooped in the Ballarat nugget,
Mr. J. W. Williamson, of Parramatta
Gaol, we read, has perpetrated a Jubilee ode. Wo
have seen the ode, and a second-hand idiot could
tell that it is the outcome of twelve months’ hard
labour.
Mr. John Harris, who fills the Sydney
Mayoral chair for 1888, emigrated from London-
derry, Ireland, at the early age of four years.
Beach wasn't near so old when ho left home, and
he is now several lengths ahead on the scroll of
fame.
Neil Matteraon, the sculler, now keeps a
pub. in Sydney, and has gone into the business of
being interviewed, and saying how he means to
win the championship some day. He is just now
sculling very extensively in the columns of the
evening newspapers.!^'
Robert Heaps (aged 10), of Mount Gam-
bler (S.A.), has been committed for trial on a
charge of criminally assaulting a girl of 11. This
is getting things down pretty flne, whichever way
it is looked at, and either there is a very rowdy
boy of 10 in the case, or a remarkably hard-
swearing gill of 11. N.B.— lnfants hanged at re-
duced rates.
For tricks that are vain, the heathen
Chinee is peculiar. Very peculiar. An opium-
sodden ed chunk of leprous humanity, named Ah
On, tried to end a contagions existence in Sand-
hurst lock-up by cutting his throat with a piece
of zinc. Zinc of that I If he hadn’t been dis-
covered in time, he would have znnk into a pre-
mature grave.
The Marquis of Normanby did Caulfield
Races on Boxing Day, looking a little older and a
little more farmer-like than of yore. They do say
that the old gentleman has come out to marry his
“second,” but we believe things haven’t got so
far as that. Normanby comes as an ardent wooer
to learn his noble fate from the lady’s own lips.
“ A-aid him, O 1 Cu-upid, Go-odd of Lo-o-ve I ”
This latter remark should be set to music.
District Court Judge Paul, of Queensland,
has one of those faces you notice in a crowd. It
generally presents a pleasing expression—bat not
always. Once a jury brought in a verdictof “not
guilty,” in the teeth of the c’earest evidence to
the contrary. “ Prisoner, the Jury have acquitted
you of the charge, and so you may go—but take
care you don’t do it again," This is what he
said, but be looked six months with bard labour.
“Archibald Forbes, the famous war cor-
respondent," fays an American paper, “after he
made his first visit to this country, was a splendid
specimen of healthy manhood. He arrived at
New York from England, the otter day, a mere
wreck of his former self. He left at once for
Washington, the home of his wife’s family, and
there he hopes to get well. But he is so feeble at
present that he can scarcely move about his
room.’
Another fable about the Mari is of Ailes-
bury. When he was Lord Savernake, he was
carousing with some of bis choice gentlemen com-
rades in some lavourite haunt, when a friend
came in, and, calling him aside, whispered to him
quietly that the old Marquis was dead, and en-
deavoured to lead him outside. But, shaking
him off, the flushed young “nobleman” turned
to the gaudy company, and slid, “ Look here, old
fellows, did you hear that? I’m a blanked Mar-
quis !”
Mr. John Anderson, nominal traffic-
manager of the Victorian Railways, died last
week. Mr. Anderson was a pleasant old bachelor
who secured bis billet in easy-going times, and
never departed from a steady Government stroke.
The Windsor accident enquiry made it quite evi-
dent that this amiable and popular Tite Barnacle
understood little about the traffic which, accord-
ing to poflte fiction, he controlled. He died in
the full enjoyment of £l4OO a year. In every but
an official sense Mr. Anderson’s death is a loss
to the Victorian community.
Judge Docker, of N.S.W., says that the
billet of a life-insurance agent is “ one of the
lowest positions, under ordinary circumstances, to
which a man can descend.” Docker has made so
many extraordinary statements of late and done
so many extraordinary things that people have
ceased to take much notice of him, but it looks as
if the time were near when he would have to be
medically examined with a view to having him
stopped short. Even if it should be merely liver
or biliousness he might, in justice to the pri-
soners who come before him, be adjourned for
repairs, ard when he is cleaned and scraped he
would probably go on with greater satisfaction
both to himself and the suffering country which
he sends to gaol.
Thus a London correspondent:
I had a conversation the other day with a near relative of
Algernon Swinburne, and was told some interesting things
in regard to the famous poet. His childhood and boyhood,
up to the age of eighteen were extremely straight-laced. He
was brought up by his mother in the most absurd fashion,
and kept under such restraint and control that at eighteen
he was accustomed to ask her permission to havq a second
piece of toast at breakfast. He was coddled and wstched,
and protected by the maternal petticoats and apron-string
as if he were a tender girl, until almost a man. Doubtless
the dormant spirit of genius within him rebelled against
such Miss Nancyish nonsense and made him, directly he
went to Oxford and got clear of his mother's eye and frown,
go to the other extreme. His family are people of the most
rigid, old-fashioned, and conservative ways. They are
eminently proper in every thing, and at one time, when the
poet had not achieved the renown he enjoys to-day, affected
to be shocked at his behaviour in writing such naughty
poetry, and disgracing the Swinburne name. Now, however,
while not exactly and avowedly countenancing him and hia
rather lax style of life and writings, they are glad enough,
though they haven’t the honesty to say so, to have so great a
man in the world of letters for kinsman.
The portly, well-conditioned form of Sir
George Frederick Verddh, K.C.M.G., C. 8., &0.,
&0., &c,, is again giving the girls a treat on the
Sydney Block. Many, many years ago the gentle-
man who is now Sir George Yerdon was a slim
youth, doing duty amidst dust and discomfort, on
the Australian Wharf, Melbourne, as discharging
clerk for Heap and Co , now Grice, Sumner, and
Co. The slim youth, however, gave up checking
ships’ cargoes, and went to the University to
study law. Was successful, and was admitted to
the Bar, but never practised ; went in for politics,
became member for Williamstown, captain of the
local volunteer corps, and subsequently Treasurer
in several Ministries. He went on a mission to
England, and obtained the free gift of a used-up
man-of-war for the colony and a C.8.-ship for him-
self. Subsequently, he accepted the Agent-
Generalship of Victoria, at a salary of £2OOO, but
resigned the post, assigning as a reason that it
cost him £5OO more than his salary to beep up the
position. In any case, however, he preferred
money-changing to politics, and became the Aus-
tralasian superintendent of the K. S. and A. C.
Bank.
Some years ago, the chief priest at St.
Mary’s Cathedral, Sydney, was a genial Cork man,
Father Tim M'Carthy, the same who induced
Vane, the bushranger, to forsake his evil ways and
give himself up to justice. Few know why
Father Tim lefo St. Mary’s and took that trip
homo which ended in his death in bis native city.
On the death of the venerated Archbishop Fold-
ing, his successor, Dr. Vaughan, decided that a
pulpit oration shonld be delivered reviewing the
life and labours of the good man who had just
gone. Father Tim, as an old associate and bosom
friend of the deceased, was chosen to deliver the
oration conditionally on his submitting the MS.
to his Grace, which Father Tim did. The event-
ful Sunday evening arrived, but Father Tim, who
was fairly fond of the good things of this life, had
secreted a couple of tumblers of good whisky
punch under his waistcoat, and, on ascending the
pulpit, delivered an oration from his heart, not
from the MS., conveniently forgetting the para-
graphs laudatory of Dr. Folding’s successor. Dr.
Vaughan thereupon decided that Father Tim
needed change of air, and St. Mary’s knew the
genial Cork man no more.
Mr. Patrick Kenna, who has just been
appointed Vice-Consul at Sydney for the U.S ,
has, young as he is, a history of his own. He is
a native of Bathurst, N.S.W., and his father, an
adherent of the R.C. Church, sent him for his
final polish to Sydney Grammar School. To this
course Mathew Quinn, by the Grace of God, R C,
Bishop of Bathurst, objected, and commanded
the removal of the lad, and threatened that if
compliance were not yielded all the pains and
penalties of the church, here and hereafter, would
be enforced. Old Dick was stubborn, refused
compliance, and continued to do so till on his
PARKES (hauling old friend out of the mud-hole of obscurity): “COME UP, DAVIES, OLD
MAN, WE VE SOME MORE WORK FOR YOU TO DO."
deathbed, when fresh negotiations were made by
Mother Church for a settlement of the difficulty.
Kenna was still stubborn, and declared himself
prepared to meet the. King of Terrors, or any other
king, rather than yield. Mathew Quinn was also
stubborn, the result being that Kenna died with-
out “ the rites ” of the Cturch, and his body was
denied six feet by two in the local consecrated
ground. The family, a wealthy one, was equal to
the occasion, and a vault was built on a half-acre
allotment overlooking the city of the plains where,
beneath a splendid marble monument, rests in
peace the victim of sectarian feuds and ani-
mosities.
A local paper thus describes a Collie gwood
(Vic.) vagrant:—
He had tint look about him which characterises a certain
class of “ spielers ’’ —wan face, cowering eyes, receding fore-
head, pug-m se, long coat and choker, big feet, c ily hands,
dirty nails, feetid breath and globular black hat—with any
quantity of " blarney.
One would think this was a portrait of a Sydney
alderman.
At Parramatta, about two months ago, the
Orange clan rolled up in a m'ghty conclave to
celebrate the worn-out gag about “ the merciful
preservation of the King and Parliament of Eng-
land from the gunpowder treason and plot.” We
have now a scheme on hand for commemorating
the o ocasion when Charles the First lost his head
of ble ssed memory, and when we have raised a
little money we will have a lark that will make
old King C. swear in his mausoleum.
POLITICAL
POINTS
John Davies, M.L.C.—May Learning
Come.
“The noisome political cove of the wild-
cat party presided over by Mr. Dibbs.” Verbal
exotic from the Sydney D.T.
Mr. Archibald Forbes, after his visit to
Australia, said: “ The one inevitable result of
the first great war in which Britain becomes en-
gaged is that she will lose her Australian colonies,
which will seek security in separation.”
The late N.Z. Minister of Mines once told
an irrepressible member to “ repair to another
place.” Sheol, we believe, was what he meant,
but somehow an impression got abroad that it
was the Legislative Courcil he was driving at.
M‘Elhone says that if Haynes talks dis-
respectful like about the churches in
the House he’ll deal with him when he gets him
outside. It’ll fare particularly badly with Mud J.
if he talks disparagingly of Dane O'Brine and St.
Benedict’s where Mac. rents a pew and worships
weekly.
More gore and glory ! The New Zealand
defence expenditure from 1878 to 1887 amounted
to £174,018, quite irrespective of a little outstand-
ing balance of £50,631 ; and Tryon, according to
popular report, said he could bust all the defences
which the colony got for the money in a couple of
hours at the outside.
Now that Trickelt, M.L.A., has gone to
the Upper Dead House, there is room for a man at
Paddington who does not believe in the theory
that Providence made Australians because the
manufacturers of England were short of cus-
tomers, and because the Chow was on the look-
out for some one to buy his cabbage.
“ The hon. member goes round the country
with a publican and a prima donna,” was the
accusation once brought against a prominent
member of the N.Z. House of Representatives.
Then the offender rose with a penny flower in his
coat, and replied in soft accents, “I plead guilty
to the prima donna, but not to the publican.”
A New Zealand M.L.A. wants a com-
mittee of newspaper men appointed whose duty
it shall be to translate the laws “ out of the vile
jargon of the lawyers into the purity of the
Queen’s English." Which Queen’s English ? The
pure outpouring of the pick-and-shovel man or
the Johnsonian drivel of the electioneering editor?
Some queer scenes were enacted in our
early colonial days. The Sydney Gazette, of
March 5, 1803, records a memorable attempted
execution: “Joseph Samuels, for burglary was
three times suspended ; first, the rope separated ;
second, it unrove at the fastening; third, it
snapped short! The case was represented to the
Governor who was pleased to reprieve him.”
Mr. 'William Teece, M.L A, for Goulburn
(N.S.W.). was last week arrested while wander-
ing about under the impression that he had been
sentenced to death. He was committed to the
reception-house, but will in a week or so return
to his legislative duties. Mr. Teece is a man of a
certain amount of ability, but it is high time he
resigned a position for which circumstances utterly
disqualify him.
When the British army declares for demo-
cracy, the last prop which shored up a decaying
Toryism will be gone for ever, and the British
army is fast coming to this point. At Tallamore
(Ireland) recently, the soldiers broke out of the
barracks to make the old town echo with cheers
for William O’Brien, while the officers howled,
raged, cursed, and commanded in vain. It was
the first sign of the coming British mutiny.
“ It is all very well to get a pair of trousers
for 11*., but where is the almighty 11s. to come
from?” asked Day, M.L. A., at the Protectionist
meeting iast week at Paddington, Sydney. Well,
according to the Freetraders when a cheap-labour
ship brings the pants from a foi eign country the
Australian is to make enough to buy them by
humping the bales on the wharf, always provided
a Kanaka or a Chow can’t be got to do it cheaper!
Some two months ago, Premier Griliies in-
vited some Victorian Ms.P. and a few other
persons to take a “ friendly glass of wine ” with
him on the occasion of the christening of a room
In Parliament House. Of course they guzzled. A
few weeks back the guzz’ers found that Duncan,
the canny Scot, had tacked £127 on to the Esti-
mate, ye ken, in payment of the booze which
they fondly imagined he had provided at his own
expense.
One or two fresh land-slips are reported
in the neighbourhood of Mudgee (M.S. W,), and
the time is evidently approaching when Haynes
electorate will slip away altogether. Then the
Mudgee geophoglst will stand “like an orphan
bandicoot on a burnt ridge,” and dig with a long-
handled shovel in the hops of finding some lone
survivor of the mentally boss-eyed race of
heathens who, in a weak moment, sent him to
Parliament.
Protection to local industries and a land
tax premise to be the two principal cries of the
Opposition at the coming Queensland election.
Griffith speaks hopefully of the effect ha will pro |
duce on the constituencies by some political gyra-
tion which he proposes to execute in the Federal
Council, and MTlwraith promises, for bis part, to
rescue the country from bankruptcy and Imperial
flunkeyism. As far as can be seen at present, the
country is with Sir Thomas, and Sawmill of
Wales is sliding on the downward road which
leads to obscurity.
It’s said that there’s a one-sided vendetl a
between the Byrons and Castlereagbs, Lwd
Lieutenant Londonderry has cast L*dy Anne
Blunt, granddaughter of Childe Harold Byron,
into gaol, under the Tory Coercion Act, and
people say its'bf causa the original Byron called
Saic’de Castlereagh a varmint, which somehow or
other escaped the anathema and boot-toe of St,
Patrick. Castlereagh was the first Unionist, and
Byron was a Home Ruler. One of the few
speeches which George Gordon made in the Lords
was in favour of Parnellism a generation before
Parnell was brrn.
There’s something wrong in the N.Z.
Legislative Council —the Hupper ’Ouse, as Johnny
Marlin affectionately calls it. One of tbe Maori
M.eL.C., having gorged too much rotten shark,
gave his vote in the wrong direction, and, when
he woke to the fact, there was a lively time.
Somebody then moved, or something moved him
to move, for most of the old fossils are too shaky
to move further than Bellamy’s refreshment-room,
that, for the, future, when a vote is taken, all
members should rise in their seats. This motion,
however, was negatived immediately, as most of
the members are already so far gone that they re-
quire to be shored up when the House adjourns,
and removed in wheelbarrows. To ask that these
battered derelicts should rise and vote was a
bitter mockery.
The Hon. Mr. Scotland, of the N.Z.
Legislative Council, is a gentleman who has seen a
lot of vociferous politics, and having tried to do
nothing for a number of years and miserably
failed, he was finally relegated to the Parlia-
mentary lumber room. As a rule he keeps pretty
quiet in that elevated station, but the other day
this oasis in a great mental desert, was taken bad
with an idea on the subject of railway manage-
ment, and opened his mouth and spake. The
popular clamour for reform he described as “ tha
blatherifgs of an ignorant populace, supported by
a lot of miserable penny-a-liner rags of papers,
editors of which whan they have nothing else to
do, take a pull at the whiskey bottle and write an
article on legislative reform, or railway mis-
management,” and having delivered himself of
this noble sentiment he sat down amid applause.
Mr. Scotland, of course, believes that while he
survives and draws his screw pretty reg'lar the
Legislature (doesn’t want reform, and the ignorant
populace, whose boots he isn’t qualified to clean,
have no right to ‘ blather” while he is there to
blather for them. Cot pleas ta Tuke o’ Argyle.
Parkea* Centennial Morgue, cold-meat es-
tablishment, lunatic asylum, temporary resting-
place for dead-heats from England, and hospital
for thanking victorious troops, has gone to sleep,
along with many other fads which have emanated,
at different times, from the seething brain of the
Kiama Ghost. Further consideration of the pro-
ject has been deferred till February, and when
February comes the Centenary will be a faded,
antique drunk, and everybody will be dyspeptic,
bad-tempered, dead-broke, and afflicted with re-
morse and snuffles, and nobody will care one soli-
tary individual dump for a celebration which has
got so woefully into arrear. The eminent bread-
waggon officers of N.S.W. will have to be
thanked, as before, in any spot where they can
find shelter from the wet, and when the great
scientists and statesmen of the colony pass away,
they will be rushed round, as usual, to the ceme-
tery, instead of a gilded Government official call-
ing for them in a gilded State House waggon, alnd
saying to the weeping widow, “Here, mum,
hurry up, and pass out that ’ere corpse.” Of
course, this doesn’t matter much to the corpse,
but it is an awful collapse for the victorious
troops. The soldiers of Australia would have
rushed cheerfully to battle when they knew
that there was a place all ready to thank
them in, but what is the good of bounding on a
square ot Russian bayonets merely for the sake (f
catching rheumatism afterwards while being con-
gratulated in a windy shed ? There is no induce-
ment in such a prospect—-at least none that we
can see. Moreover, there is always an unfinished
look about things when the thanking is done in
the street or in a slushy park ; in nine cases out
of ten there are no thanking tools, ready for one
thing, and the iob has to be done by hand, which
is always unsatisfactory. We have been thanked
ourselves in a public-house, and down a mine, and
in a dog-show, and on the lee-side o£ a dripping
hedge, and in a boot-factory, and on a pcst-card,
and we, therefore, speak from experience. In
future we prefer being thanked by cheque or by a
promissory-note with two negotiable names on the
back.

A citizen, in trousers and a toll-topper,
signing himself J. B. Watts, suggests, through
the medium of the S. M. Herald, that the
Government should erect ‘‘ guide posts ” over the
whole glorious colony of N.S.W. to direct the
wayfarer either to the nearest public-house or the
nearest waterhole where the pensive deceased
dog fritters away the golden moments in the sun-
light. Failing guide-posts as a too expensive
scheme for a Government so economical as the
present, J. II. Watts says that strips of zinc might
bQ tvWned round the hoar Jr gum with “This way
to Jamberoo, 1 ’ cr “Turn to the right for Humpy-
bong ” painted upon them If these reforms are
effected good-bye to all hope cf native poetry!
How the deUce cohld a itendall sing of tbb lOflely
btlsh and the lost than With his ladylike expres-
sions about his distant hortte, if the whole popu-
lation knew for a dead fact that it hasn’t possible
fbr a man to get lost irt Australia, and that evBry
gum-tree liad a tin band round its stomach showing
tlie traveller the short-cut to the water or the wine!
How could the belated bushman lie down beneath
the wattle any more, and use cuss expressions be-
cause he never expected to see his aged mother
again ? What about the lonely horseman on a
lonely moke in the midst of the arid wilds, or the
well-brought-up boy from home who goes astray
in the bush, and is comforted in his last hours by
the Bible which was conferred upon him by a
Suoday-school pirate in childhood’s happy hours,
or the parched digger ker-lutching his gold as he
perishes among the sun-soorohed rocks? What is
to become of them all ? If there is any noble
sentiment left in the community let this infamous
proposal about guide-posts be received with the
scorn which it deserves,
s » *
From the pious S. M. Herald once
more : —
"WANTED, those in touch with Heaven to supplicate
’ moral, political, and phys'cal mercies for our
country.
We sit out in the pale moonlight with the plain-
tive bull-ant making tracks for our log, and ask
pathetically what in the whole Empire is meant
by this ? Is it a new hair-wash “ ad.' 1 or what ?
An American paper thus etherealises a
star of the ballet popularly knofirn as Sara the
Kicker. Sara, it would appear, is cf an uncer-
tain age, but She looks 23, and kicks five years
younger i —
It was a rush and a flash, and a vision of Mask legs and
black gauze and diamonds. BJje bounds in like a firefly, and
whirls around the stage like autumn leaves in a cyclone Her
feet shoot around in circles- her arms and head and body
spin in wild delirium You would think—;if you had tme to
think--tbat she was going to kick herself into fragments and
spatter the stage with her remains. Presently her little
Slippered foot ascends with lightning-like velocity and strikes
ft point a long way above her flying hair, then whirls around
anil gyrates about hPr shoulder and comes down again, then
Up and around as before. She is apparently made of rubber
and whalebone ; her kicking is as the revolutions of a fly-
wheel, or a buzz-saw with a full head of steam on; she
tbt-ows her foot around her neck and kicks herself in the
hack of the head—she is weird, fantastic, diabolical. She is
an aerobatic imp of darkness. Sara is a terpsichorean
cytlone.
Sira kicks in black, it seems, out of respect for
her husband deceased. She has to kick for a
living, but she wants the old man, if he should
chance to look down upon her, to feel that ho
isn’t forgotten amid the pressure of earthly busi-
ness. _ ,

la a Yictorian town, on the main line from
Melbourne to Bchnca, lived a boozy medico whose
greatest trouble was the scarcity of brandy, and
whose most splendiferous picnic was a quiet
Corner and a mislaid bottle of “ stuff.” He was
the surgical ornament to a Volunteer Corps, but
In default of gun-shot wounds or sabre cuts, his
Scientific knowledge was utilised by his comrades
as taster in ordinary to ihe pomp and circumstance
of glorious holiday war when the battalion let
itself loose on the rampage. The doctor lived
next df’or to a teetotaller, who generally kept
sotnethieg in the house in case of an accident
One night a most infernal row was heard in the
teetotal back-yard, and the gallant Sangrado, in
his dual capacity of a father and a soldier, sallied
forth breathing curses not loud but deep, clad
only In his night-shirt, with his glittering sword
between his martial teeth. He scaled the fence
and aroused his neighbour. It was the witching
hour of midnight, and together they searched the
yard for the cause of the trouble. They found a
drunken tramp, and ignominlously ejected him.
The doctor turned to “git,” but suddenly remem-
bering that cherished bottle—in case of accidents
—and remembering also that his own looker
was empty, he asked for just one nip. The
teetotaller produced the amber-tinted brain-
stealer. The medico drank long and deep, and
then requested the bottle, for which he would
return another in the morning. He departed
happy. He made his exit by the street gate and
entered his own garden. He feared to awaken
his better-half by the clinking of glasses. The
moon was brightly sailing overhead, and, although
the night was cold, had he not the surest of corpse-
revivers in his personal possession ? He sat down
on a garden-seat In his shirt and finished the

bo get into his house and return to the bosom of
his family. He stumbled over the scraper ! . . .
When the milkman visited that mansion in the
full glory of the newly-risen sun he found an
almost nude figure stretched out upon the veran-
dah with one hand grasping the hilt of his glitter-
ing sabre and the other frantically clutchir g the
broken neck of a dead marine. The doctor was
assisted inside in sections which were promptly
bruised by his stalwart better-half with a broom-
stick, pickled and put in soak for a fortnight.
Sangrado loves the bottle as of yore, but he never
discusses the merits of Hennessy’s Elixir unless
his manly form be safely encased in a suit of
double barrelled tweed. #
The N.S.W. Art Society are not going to
have It all their own way. The indefatigable P.
Fletcher-Watson, who, as an advertiser, boats
the Art Society’s “ boss ” hollow, has just crept
up behind and taken the wind completely out of
the rival show’s sail by obtaining the patronising
smile of Governor Carlngton, which the others
were notoriously unable to do. While the N.S.W.
artists had to be content with such insignificant
fry as IngUs and Clarke, and some editors of
mediocre dailies, Mr. P. Fletcher-Watson
manages to secure the presence at the opening
ceremony, of Lord and Lady Carington, the Coun-
tess of Carnarvon, the Look of Manchester, the
Karl of Buckingham, and the Bishop of Sydney,
while he has amongst his patrons the Karl of
Aberdeen, the Karl of Roseberry, the Right Hon.
W. B. Dailey* P.C.* and the Hon. B. K. Wise.
The Sydney D.T., in an obviously inspired article,
seeks bo discount all this sorb of thing, yet in a
leader of a week or two ago it advised the artists
bo secure the patronage of the wealthy by hook
or by crook if they expected ever to do any good
for themselves. Now P. Fletcher-Watson has
succeeded where the N.SW. Art Society miserably
failed ; evidently he has a head for biz worth the
whole boiling. Mind we do not say that Car mg ton s
presence anywhere proves that the affair is worth
anything. He always yawns twenty times to the
square minute at anything that demands the
exercise of that which he has precious little of,
and he shows the whole time that he would
sooner be at a horse-race or a boat struggle. For
our own part, we must say that we wouldn’t give,
a crimson-steeped butcher's malison for the art
that endeavours to thrive on parasitism and self-
abasement, and while grovel to wealth is recog-
nised as the raison d'etre of art in Australia, a
national art will be absolutely impossible.

A few more Press amenities come from
Victoria. One energetic editorial person writes :
A cross between a white man and a Chinaman, with a
dash of gaolbird thrown in, came to the ofbce on Wednes-
day last and wanted the editor to apologise ;for calling him
a low scoundrel ” in our last issue. In order to prevent
bloodshed the editor promised to apologise, and he is now
fulfilling his pledge. He hastens to inform the public that
the Yahoo in question is not a low scoundrel. Afier full in-
quiries the editor finds that he is a superlative, God-for-
saken skunk, who would rob his blind grandmother if he got
the chance.
As this is the apology a good many people would
be glad to know what the original insult was like.

If Eve had been constructed so that she
couldn t stand up, her descendants of to-day would
not have needed to trouble about her mode of
dressing. When a lady is sitting, it is difficult to
tell what she has got on. This original sagacity
was occasioned by a prolonged study of seated
femininity at the Summer meeting of the A.J.C.
at Randwick. It was too moist on Tuesday
morning for the darlings to put on their prettiest,
and when the weather lifted after luncheon tew
were plucky enough to parade the lawn, for they
“ positively hadn’t anything to wear.” We use
this term in its ordinary conversational sense only.
Consequently, a very large number remained
planted hard down, and those who did promenade
wore a disheartened aspect. There were a few
nice toilets, however, here and there, and a 1 so
some outrageous clothes that were an insult to
the human understanding. One dress of rose-
pink veiling, trimmed with pink-paper-satin fix-
ings, was a howl of artistic despair in twelve
yards. A ‘ 1 get-up ’’ of maroon velvet, yellow bonnet
and red parasol, was loud enough to waken the
dead ; and one much-attired angel faced a bleak
wind from Botany in a cream gauze dress with a
cascade of flaming yellow bows down the front!
We left when we encountered th's siren. It
undermined our constitution only to look at her,
and we could feel our massive intellect tottering
on its throne.

Flora, Howard St. Clair acd Walter
Gibson had a sweet time of it while their young
love lasted, but when that era passed matters
grew very sultry, especially for the man. He was,
when his wooing first began, the Premier of Hono-
lulu, and divide time spooning with the girl
and meeting votes of censure proposed by a soul-
less Opposition. His age, when his love over
powered him, was something over three score and
ten ; just the time when the average statesman
yearns for some Stella, who will cuddle him on
“ mountain heights, ten thousand feet above the
sea, love.” She was—well she owned up to being
29, ’ and she still mourned for a dear who had
departed some months before she met Premier
Gibson. Her occupation was that of the common
or garden book-hawker, and it was in the pursuit
of her lawful calling that she first encountered
Walter Murray. He was so shook by the
widow’s first onslaught that he refused to

ensuing date. Which she did several times, and
tie bought books considerably, paying for them in
a laviehf aehion peculiar even to Australian Pre oners
who have very good friends ready to endorse very
bad bills. For a Longfellow, price 39 dollars, he
gave her a 50 dollar cheque, refusing to accept
change, and for a 60 dollar Shakespeare he
donated a 100 dollar cheque, which, unlike the
cheque of some septuagenarian Premiers, were
duly paid on presentation. Then their love be-
came torrid; he said he “ counted every moment
until the time when he should again see her;
she being a widow, and experienced in these
affairs, thought, as she subsequently asserted,
that this “ was getting a little bit strong. Then
he wanted to call and see her three limes a week,
and she gave him Tuesday, Thursday, and Satur-
day evenings, from Bto 11. He said he wanted
‘ ‘ to enjoy her sweet companionship andlovmg con-
fidence.” His “darling,” his “dear love, and a
sweet, sweet darling” was what be called her at
this time, and when she said she liked roses, he
started a nigger away to plant two acres of them.
They were very chummy then ; he used to bathe his
forehead with her eau de-cologne, and he k ssed

Then they were engaged, and thereupon the row
began, for a vulgar local newspaper, in a scoffing,
anonymous kind of way, alluded to the match,
and Walter Murray’s daughter got to hear what
was going on, and then suddenly Flora saw him
no more. She asked him to meet her at her borne,
but he would not, so she changed the venue to the
local Supreme Court, but still he wouldn t come
He fled from the scene, and a compassionate jury,
who were free from the Wellerite prejudice, said
that the devastation of Flora’s affection was worth
10 000 dollars at current rates. Which little idyll
carries a moral lesson to impressionable and
mature Premiers.

At a stallion show at Gundigai (N.S.W.),
the other day, one Misther Lynch entered an
animal which he called The Cardinal, in
honour of the eminent Dr. Moran. What the
holy fathers of the Church think of this we don t
know, but many years ago an Irishman of Wex-
ford christened his prize hull P.us IX., and had
cause to be sorry for it. The parish priest
solemnly denounced him from the altar for his
impiety. He cussed him and his house, and
everything and everybody in the house ; he cussed
his stable, wash-house, and outbuildings; he
cussed the bull, and everybody who went near
the bud, ard all the bull’s relatives end
progenitors, and prayed that its horn might grow
into its eye, and that its tall might decay, and
that it might get lost and be found by a “ dlrthy
Prodestant” : he cus'ed the inside of the animal
and the outside, and the upper side and the under
side, and ever; thing else he could think of. The
owner sued him for damages on account of all
this malediction, and when, after a long trial, he
won, and presented the priest with a tremendous
bill of costs, the holy man filed his shovel and
didn’t pay a cent. The plaintiff was pretty nearly
sold up for law expenses In the end, and the bull
was mortgaged so deeply that it never recovered
the shock.

To Lady Brasaey the peer owes such social distinction as
he may have achieved. She was amiable, genial, and am
bitious, and it seems a sad fate that ended so abruptly the
enjoyment of the coronet for which she had worked so
assiduously. Amongst the public her ladyship was known
as the authoress rf the “Voyage of the Sunbeam, a work of
little originality, interest, or literary merit, and which was
not published with a view to profit. As a hostess, she shone,
and her cook was always excellent. Her death, lam in-
formed, was almost tragic. Maddened by the fever, she
jumped overboard the yacht, and her husband, who followed
her, was with difficulty rescued from sharing the fate of his
loyal and affectionate wife.

But the sea turned crusty and rough, and all the

Lumley walketh abroad with a gentle reserve

An«obituary notice in a Melbourne paper

“ To did is gain,
All earthly joy forsaking,
From toll and pain
To endless joy awaking.”
It may be for parsons. And yet they have a
pretty good time, taking ib all round, In this vale
of tears. The “ earthly joy ” referred to in the
second line Is evidently an inadvertent confession
of this The “ toil and pain ”is obviously a mere
after thought,
outre means. He has built a Japanese house, be-
ginning with a forty-ton roof of grotesque tiles
and ending with an oil-paper basement. The
rooms are divided from each other by paper par-
titions, on which the Tgh Hart of Japan has been
lavishly expended. This papier- mAohe mansion
may be a very nice thing from the point of view
of the cultivated Court of the Empress Josephine,

and a playf nl humour, would produce results with
it which we shudder to think of. The Judge, also,

A well-known Sydney chemist— let us cal
him Thompson—was endeavouring to get to sleep
the other night. Ho thought he heard somebody
trying the window. Then it sounded as if the
party—whoever he might be—was paying a like
attention to the door. The now thoroughly
aroused citizen crept softly out of bed, snatched
up a revolver, and stole down stairs like a oat on
a galvanised lean-to. He took with him no light,
and sidled gently towards the door. There was a
clicking going on ; a bit of wire gracing—though
not loudly—in the wards of the lock. In the room
above sat Thompson’s brother, writing. He, too,
heard the clicking sound. He made a movement
towards the door of his room. His brother heard
it, and stole softly upstairs, to meet him with a
lighted candle In his hand. To explain the situa-
tion, blow out the candle, and for both men to
descend was the work of a moment. Pressure
was applied. The door strained on its hinges.
According to arrangement, during one of the
pauses the bolt was shot back ; silently, breath-
lessly, the latch was lifted. Pressure was again
applied. The door flew open with a bang, and the
lock-picker tumbled into the room, receiving a
smack on the point of the iaw which felled him to
the earth in transit. Thompson covered the
prostrate housebreaker with his revolver. “ Where
did you come from?” He had lost bis way.
He was frightened. “ That won’t do, sonny.
What’s your name?" Oh, his name was
Wilkie. “ Wilkie, is it, alias what ?’’ Pros-
trate housebreaker nonplussed. “ Where’s your
Jemmy, eh ? Roll up your trousers. Take off
your boots and let us have a look ! ” He pro-
tested, the other insisted, covering his man with
the revolver the while. So he was compelled to
take off Ms boots and roll up his trousers. Sure
enough jemmy, picklocks, skeleton-keys, all the
stock-in-trade and working paraphernalia of a
regular professional burglar. “ Git 1 ” The robber
rose. “ Stay I I’ll call a policeman. I’ll give
you five years for this, my fine fellow.” The man
groaned. “No 1 clear off this time. You won’t
come here again. If you do you’ll get a dose of
lead In your skull. We’re generally awake In
this quarter, and we receive your sort with ball-
cartridge." The man skulked. The treatment he
met with did him more good than five years on
the roads.

Governor Jervois, of N.Z., gives unassum-

Civil Service puts on elaborate side, and Smith, of

and jam he can dab round the sides of the gulf in
which he puts his hash. One of these affairs was
hold one evening recently, and all the diplomatic
and military departments were there discoursing
strategy and other lofcy subjects, when the sten-
torian voice of the menial at the door announced
“Mr. Browne.” The new-comer rushed up to
Sir William and shook hands with him, and told
him that it seemed like old times to meet him
again, and his Excellency, with a vague idea that
they had been boys together somewhere or other,
murmured out something to the effect that it was
with no ordinary pleasure that he gazed once
more upon the lineaments of Mr. Browne. Then
Browne strolled round the room with the aspect
of a duke, and Jervois, hardly knowing what to
do with him, beckoned to a battle-scarred veteran
who had seen much dinner service, and asked in
an undertone who the swell might be. The battle-
scarred veteran look od at him for a moment and
recognised him. It was the temporary clerk in

American ladies have somehow acquired a
toilet secret which many a British and Australian
dame would give her back-hair to possess. At
the age of 45, or thereabouts, the female of the
human race generally begins to wrestle with the
fluff upon her cranium, and tries to persuade her-
self that it isn’t turning grey. But it is turning
grey all the same. There are silver threads
among the gold, and many an elderly lady whose
powerful extremities and frame like that of a
canal-boat officer sesm to suggest that she is too
muscular for the melting mood, weeps bitter
tears and prances round the room when she gets
out of bed on a cold morning and finds that she is
more grizzly than she was the previous night. At
this stage of her existence she has two resources
before her. Either she must dye and become a
purple-black monstrosity, or she must struggle
through the dreadful intervening period between
the dark hair of youth and the beautiful silver-
white of age as best she can, and in the event of
her choosing the latter alternative, the chances
are that she perishes before the goal Is reached—
fades away of her own back-hair and its attendant
misery. The American lady, however, cuts
the process short. When she finds that the
end of the human frame which she eats with is
beginning to lose its colour she retires for a week
or so, and then comes out again with a wealth
of beautiful white hair which keeps its colour for
ever afterwards, and makes the face of middle
age look quite jouthful by comparison. Young
men begin to worship her again at this stage, and
send her bouquets, and she enjoys the pleasures
of a dual existence—her face Is young enough to
make the male deceiver fall In love with her, and
her hair is old enough to protect her against
slander. Sho doesn’t flirt, but she can temporarily
adopt an orphan dude and make him take her
round, and when she is tired of his company, she
can hunt up a fresh orphan any day. But she
keeps her religiously, and her piebald
foreign rivals sigh enviously and wonder how she
does It.

The Boidi Aquarium management's ad-
vertising Lanoeah caracoles through the streets
of Sydney smoking a scrumptious clay pipe,
which projects beneath his snowy helmet with its
nodding plumes like a steamer funnel beneath a
holiday awning. There is a universe of satire in
this radiant creature’s parody of the beautiful
youth that encircle the gorgeous chariot of
N.S.W. vice-regality, but the Bondi people do not
make as much of the efiigy as they might. In
addition to the clay pipe, we would suggest, by
way of lance, a barber’s pole, indicating. In it s
variegated elongation, the genealogy of the
martial suckling. The ancient barber was a
lancer also—a sort of blood-letter and family
physician in mufti. Dirty, mud-bespattered boots
would not be inappropriate by way of legend, In
regard to the vulgar rabble upon which the
radiant soldier treads. A turkey beneath his arm
as illustrative of the sort of provender the Lancer
regales himself with when camping in the country

the property of ttie unwashed, unbarbered, unper-
fumed cmaille. Should the Bondi people desire
a further list of lampooning paraphernalia for
their advertising warrior a letter addressed to the
religious editor of The Bulletin would, in the
probability of its catching that gentleman in the
intervals of his visits to the little place round the
corner, possibly be received with every attention,
and considered In his usual prayerful manner.

A vary distinguished person from home
came out to Sydney a few months ago, and con-
descended to sited the light of his sm'le on a
beastly and benighted country. He resided for a
time with a high-toned kindred soul in an aris-
tocratic quarter ; he didn't “ put up,” or •* drop
in,” or “shake down,” or “hang out”—all
these things are low—but he “resided” in his own
noble way, and reflected credit by so doing. By-
and-bye the kindred soul’s friends began to hear
of the distinguished stranger, and invitations
rolled in—among them one from a wealthy squat-
ter-fellow up-country, who presently learned with
gratification that the lofty one was coming. The
squatter and his daughters were there to receive
him, but, to their disgust, he proved less lofty than
they had anticipated—ln fact, the youngest
daughter took the old man aside and said plain-
tively ! “ Pa, he ain’t the least like the son Of a
hearh Ho isn’t nice a bit.” The was
short, stout, and red-faced. He was jerky and
assertive, and wore large boots. His hands were
big and h's legs we-e scanty, and he hadn’t known
the family two hours before he winked at the
prettiest of the three girls. When his host asked
him in impressive tones if he would have some
refreshment, he sa'd he guessed he could pick a
bit, though he ’ad ’ad a pork-pis m the train ; he
always was handy at victuals-. Two Cf the young
ladies retired haug hfelly at this point. The earls they
h a d met with in the L6ndon Journal weren’t
,handy at victuals,” and didn't eat po.’k-pies in
a train, and when the third sister joined them,
and reported that she had stayed to see the
animal feed, and had ascertained that he made a
gobbling noise all the time he was eating, they
began to wish that he hadn’t come at all. Later
on, there was a sound of merriment beneath. The
lofty one was imbibing a drop of something short,
and telling trade anecdotes about one of the
“ fust firms ” In the soft-goods trade, and the old
man was wondering all the time where ho got his
commercial knowledge, and why he fought so shy
of the subject of his aristocratic relations. As
the drop of something short grew sma'lsr at the
bottom of the bottle, the stranger put his feet on
the table, and began to tell hilarious anecdotes.
“ Biggod, old fellow, them was the very words
the party used, as sure as my name's Bob Jones,”
he said at the end of one yarn. “As sure as your
name’s what?’ screamed the squatter. “Yes;
they used to call me that for short, you know.
Sort of pet name, as you may say.” The visitor
was known in society as Ferdinand Courtenay
Howard, and it occurred to the host that Bob
Jones was rather a remarkable abbreviation, but
ho let it pass, and tha visitor tottered to bed. He
woke up about the middle of the night and
cal'ed out “ Walter ” till he roused the housa,
but when the old man pranced in he
explained that he had forgotten where he was
and imagined for a moment that the place was a
hotel. He added that he was “offal dry.” Next
morning he winked at all the three girls and in*
qulred for the “ old lady,” which led to an ex-
planation that she had been dead for some years,
whereupon he remarked cheerfully that his mother
had also “ petered out.” “ She ate too much—
that’s the fact,” he added, candidly; “and went
off quite sudden." After breakfast, he filled up
Ihe measure of his iniquity by kissing the slavey
in the passage, and as all the dishes went down in
a heap she hit him on his generous red ear and
made him howl. Then the exasperated squatter
threw him out so suddenly that he left bis hag-
gage behind him, and that station knew him no
more, Circumstances which afterwards arose lad
to an inspection of hla trunk, and the evidence
contained therein showed that the invitation had
somehow got into the wrong hands, and that a
bleeding country had been entertaining a bagman
unawares. This circumstance was duly explained
with apologies to the Icf'yman from homo, and
he said “ Haw 1” in a feeble voice, and felt more
than ever convinced that Australia was a beastly
country. “Low, common f’ler out there actually
had the dcooed impertinence to go round pretend-
ing to be mb, dontyersee,” he says in stunned
accents whenever the subject comes up in conver-
sation.

Concerning the affair which led to the
downfall of the la.ely-deCcasCi Colonel
Baker, a London correspondent thus wrote some
years ago
la the year 1875 Valentine Baker waS the lieutenant-
colonel of the Tenth Hussars, tha swelled light-cavalry
regiment in ,the service. He had been in the service since
before the Crimean War, and had served throughout that
campaign as a lieutenant iu the Twelfth Lancers. After
that he saw service in India and China and became ticked
for his dishing qualities. Brilliant, handsome, gifted, olevef;
brave, and able, be was a favourite among men, anda pet
aumng women. He was a great friend of the Prince of
Wale". The P.iaoewas the honorary colonel of the ; Tenth
Hussars-, and his being so, of course, gave an extra iclat to
the corps and its officers. In June, 1875, the Tenth were
quartered at Aldershot, and, on the afternoon of the 17th
day of that month, Colonel Piker left North Camp Station
by the South-western train for London, occupying a first-class
compartment all to himself. At Woking Station, just as the
bell was rung to start the train on again, a wagonette and pair
dashed into the stition-yard. In it were Mr. Dickinson (a
gen leman residing in the vicinity), who was driving bis
wife, daughter, aedgr om. With barely time to catch the
train, the first compartment Mr. Dickinson reached be
opened the door of, and put his daughter into. It happened
to be Colonel Baker s. Mias Dickinson was known as a great
beauty at this time. It was the period when blondes were:
all the rage, and she was regarded as a sample to swear by.
Her brother was an officer in the Royal Engineers, and she
hermit was by no means unknown at garrison balls and
places where officers do mostly resort; and her golden hair
and aiture eyes were set off by a form and figure that might
have been a model for a sculptor. Nor was her dress the
least of her attractions On the present occasion she was
dressed ia a Short travelling costume of blue serge, which
fitted her like a glove, and displayed beneath her,scout
drapeiies—it being the Zenith of the 11 pull-back” per 1 id-"a
pair of fairy-llke feet, in patent'leathgr Boots and goldhn-
clocked blue Silk stockings. A jaunty bkmveHet found hat
with a ffhitb gull’s feather in it crowned her head, while a
tlarrdw iltrip of black lace served for a mask veil. A friend
or mine who happened to be on tha train has given me tins
description. At Ciapham Junction, the passengers were
th own into a great state of excitement by the intelligence
that when the t-ain had come dashing up to the platform,
the dor r of Colonel Baker's compartment was wide
open, and the Colonel holding fast with one hand to Miss
Dickinson, who stood hatloss upon the step outside. A
great commotion followed. Briefly, Miss Dickinson’s story
was that she did not know Colonel Baker, even by sight)
that the train had hardly left Wokirg when he entered Into
conversation with her j that her short replies had no efiec't,
but that, in spite of her coldness, his manner became morS
familiar and his lingnags improper, hiS offensive actions
culminating in Ilis stooping dotVil and grasping he? By oah df
her ankles; that thereupon She jumped up and tried to Set
the alarm in mdtlou, but being intercepted by Colonel
Baker-, and not kaowiiig what else to do, she sprang to the
door, burst it open, and swung herself out upon the steps,
the train going at the ti ne at the rate of forty miles an
hour; that Colonel Baker sprang after her, and, unable to
draw her back into the compartment, he'd her firmly from
falling, as ehe might otherwise have done. In reply,
Colonel Baker had not a word to say, except to give
an absolute denial to the whole story, or at least
Miss Dickinson’s versim of it. But at length, at
the Croydon Assizes, before Mr. Justice Lush, of the
Queen s Bench, Colonel B iker was tried for criminal assault.
Colonel Baker was eonvietsd, and sentenced to a year s im-
prisonment in Maidstone gaol, and a fine of five hundred
pounds. He was cashiered from the army, losing his Corth
mission money the same being thg modest sum of sii
thousand pounds; he was szpelledpErom all his clubs, and
disgraced in every way. Tfle w dueen, to Show ht:r
special resentment, sent for Miss Dickinson to Pome add
see her at Buckingham Palace, and commiserated with her.
In fact, she tried to make a heroine of her. But she couldri’t
make that go. Besides, there were people who knew Misa
Dickinson pretty well, and though Colonel Baker, neither at
the trial nor in any public ever said a word to iiijufe
her, it somehow got whispered about that she was not alto-
gether Blameless in the matter, and that
So, altogether, tho ’.gh she succeeded in ruining Valelitine
Baker, she pretty effectually ruinOd herself as well.

A ties? chum, signing himself “ Full Up,”
has written a letter to the Melbourne Herald
Calculated to make the kangaroo sit right up. He
says: “ Melbourne simply reeks with filth> and
some of the largest buildings in ColllnS-streebj
with their gingerbread and wedding cake orna-
ment architecture (he hasn't seen Sydney General
Post-office) possess back premises that would not
he permitted to exist in Billingsgate Pish Market;
* . . You who boast of the splendour df yotlr
‘ Cjueen City of the South,’ look out of ymir rail-
way-carriage- windows at the hovels you pass oh
ybur way to marvellous Melbourne, and say if a
ihorc woebegone and filthy frioge hangs to the
skirts of much abused London.” What “Fall
tip ” further remarks about the cost of necessaries
(except that eternal meat) applies equally to every
city and township in this great country, and his
sheers at the make-believe nature of Melbourne
magnificenceshouldhaveamorethan local interest;
But the “ Qseen City ” certainly takes the cake
for squalid prosperity and go ahead ugliness. It
is a fact that in London you can get a solid roomy
house, with a respectable bit of garden, for half
the rental of a Melbourne weatherboard shanty,
Surrounded by a few feet of slimy yard, ft is a fact
that no Londoner (unlesshe has been banquettedas
a distinguished visitor) can travel on a Melbourne
suburban line without turning up his nose at the
apparently poverty-stricken surroundings. Rotten
wood fences for sturdy brick walls—tumble-down,
open wash-dens for well-built outhouses—filthy
right-of-ways for decent side entrances —and rows
upon rows of Undiscussable edifices standing
boldly out again«t the landscape like regiments of
soldiers. The Melbourne Herald is rather given
to inflating the Young Australian mind with
patriotic gas, but The Bulletin has often re-
marked that the “ old colonists,” who are chiefly
responsible for colonial b'ow, had little experience
of outside civilisation. And poor “ Full Up ”
views the matter from an outside standpoint. He
is never likely to be conducted by obsequious
councillors into the Town Hall, which is now
being beautified with a £12,000 portico. He feels
no sense of Imperial admiration for big banks in
which he hasn’t opened an account. But he
smells bad drainage, and blushes for the down
right immodesty of everyday sanitary arrange-
ments.

Oentlemen, —I have great pleasure In recom-
mending Row’s D anellon Bitters. I have been
Buffering for several years with Liver complaint,
and been under several doctors for it without any
curative result. I have only taken two bottles of
your Dandelion Bitters, and feel quite a different
man. I can, therefore, with truthfulness, advise
all who suffer from Liver complaint to try them, —

“ I have for many years been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the
liver, indigestion, pain in the chest, general de-
bility, feelings of nervousness, weariness, great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced an
unexpected and wonderful effect and change in
my system, and has removed from my mind the
horribly depressed feeling and former condition of
bodily ailment I have so unhappily experienced
for so many years.

the excellent qualities of ROW’S DANDELION

It was on the Barcoo, in the rousing old
days of big cheques and bigger sprees, when a
veteran shepherd, on a certain station, in running
round a mob of ewes and lambs to force them into
a yard close to the boss’s homestead, dropped dead
in his tracks. The squatter, a regular colonial,
experience man fresh from an English university,
knew as much of the law as one of Inglis's J’s.P.,
and had the old hand shovelled into a deep grave
on a sandhill hard by, without the semblance of a
prayer or a wake. The wheels of justice often
got bogged In those days, and consequently it was
many Sundays after when the mounted police
sergeant and his full private drew rein at the
homestead verandah, and were warmly greeted
by the boss and a stiff glass of rum. “ Anything
up?" asked the squatter. “Not much,” replied
the sergeant, “ only we’ve come to see about that
old man of yours that pegged out lately.” “ Why,
what about him ?” “Nothing, only I’ve got to
dig him up and hold an inquest as to the cause of
death.” “ The cause of death,” exclaimed the
squatter, “ why you don’t think we’ve killed
him?” “Oh, dear no, only the law requires it.
That’s all.” “ Then I’ll see you d
before I let you dig up that old man,”
was the reply. After a strong remonstrance
the sergeant caved in, well aware that his
chief and the squatter were pretty “thick.”
Next morning the members of the force rode
homeward to concoct the best report they could.
Months subsequently the squatter, on his way to
town for supplies, dropped in to have a yarn with
the district police inspector. They chatted cor-
dially, until at length the officer adred. “What
was it, by t„e-bye, that made you so infernally
rusty about raising that o'd man of yours ? ’ “Oh!
a likely thing I was going to have that oli joker
dug up : he had a cheque of mine for £35 in his
trousers pocket.”

IT Is the authorised organ of the Land Nationalisation Association of New South Wales. It
object is to firmly inaugurate in Australia Henry George’s great scheme of Land Reform—to d >

It is smartly and fearlessly written, and every man who has the interests of his fellow-men at heart

Do not ba Discouraged,
Even it you have tried many remedies for your
kidney disease or liver complaint without success
it Is no reason why you should think your disorder
incurable The most intractable cases readily yield
to the potent virtues of dr. bell’s bitters.
It is a purely vegetable compound, which ac’s on
the kidneys, liver and bowles at the same time,
and thus cleanses the whole system. Don’t wait,
but get a bottle to day and cure yourself
Sufferers from Rheumatism, Lumbago, Sciatica and
other analogous affections should try Freeman's Original
Chlorodyue, a m'dicine that has, since its introduction in
1844, been employt q on a very large scale both by the
Hidical P,ofessiou and the Public in every part of the
habitable Globe, with unvaried sucoes. Since its introduc-
tion into New South Wales the popularity of Freeman’s
Chlorodyne has been considerably enhanced, and is now re-
garded as the*moat efficient and valuable medicine that has
ever been introduced into the Colony. The Profession pre-
scribe it; Missionaries prefer and use Freeman’s Ohlorodyne,
and people leaving any of the principal porta for the interior
i, variably take a sufficient supply to last them a twelve-
month.—Sold • very where throughout the Colonies Insist
upon having “ Freeman’s ” only. Reject substitutes as they
are worthless. Trade mark, an Elephant *

WOMANS WISDOM,
11 She ins’sts that it is more importance that her family
shall be kept in full health, than th»t she should have all
the fashionable dresses and sty ! ea of the limes. She there
fore sees to it that each member of her family is supplied
with enough of Dr. Soule’s American Hop Bitters at the first
appearance of any symptoms of ill-health, to prevent a fit of
sickness with its attendant expense, care and anx eiy. All
women should exercise their wisdom in this way." “ New
Haven Pa'ladine.”*
FROM THE HUB.
There is perhaps no tonic offered to the people that
possesses as much real intrinsic value as Dr. Soule's Ameri-
can Hou Bittn s. Just at this season of the year, when the
stomach nee Is an appetiser or the blood needs purifying,
the cheapest and best remedy is Or. Soule's American Hop
Bitte s. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure;
don’t wait until you are p.-ost-ated by a d sease that may
take months for you to recover in. “ Boston Globa.’ *
Williams Australian Insecticide is death to allinsects.
Simple in apj lication—su r e in effect. This is the only genuine
Insect Destroying Powder, being certain death t» all kinds
of insects, while it is perfectly harmless to animal life, and
therefore may be used without the slightest apprehersion.
For the extermination of Mosquitos especially, the Insecti-
cide has no equal—as the fumes of the burnt powder, while
throwing off a pleasant odour, are at the same time most
destructive to them Sold in Is. boxes by all chemist i and

Consumption, Wasting Diseases and General
Debiliiy— Doctors disagree as to the relative value of
Cod Liver Oil and Hypophosphitesthe one supplying
strength and flesh, the other giving nerve i ower and acting
as a tonic to the digestive and entire system. But in
“ Scott s Emulsion or Pure Cod Liver Oil with
Hypophosphites " the two are combined, and the effect is
wonderful. Thousands who have derived no permanent
benefit from other preparations have been cured by this.
Scott's Emulsion is perfectly paLtable and is easily
digested even by those who cannot tolerate plain Cod Liver
Oil. Sold by all Chemists, two a zea, large and small.*
Commence th3 Year Right.
Don’t make too many resolution, but hold on
like grim death to those you do make If your
physical system Is out of order you should attend
to that at once, for it’s no use trying to keep a stiff
upper lip when you Kidneys or liver are taking the
courage out of you. If you lave really made up
your mind to turn over a new leaf, commence the
year by taking a thor ugh course of the celebrat ed

THE WATERBURY
SENT EOR REVIEW.
“ Lorgnette,” in the Glasgow Evening News,
has the following
“ I have had many singular articles sent me for
‘ review ’ in my 1 ime. An enterprising merchant
once sent me a cheese, which I ate and enjoyed ;
and he followed this up soon afterwards by present-
ing me with a pot of raspberry jam. Umbrellas,
lead pencils, stocking?, ahem I (which burst the
first time I had them on), patent safely pins,
collars, and so forth, have been submitted for
inspection by my eagle eye.
“ The latest is a watch, known as 'The Water-
bury Watch.’ It Is manufactured in America by
the Waterbnry Watch Comp my, and so extensive
has been the sale that the Company are now
establishing branches all over the world. I have
worn the Waterbary Watch for exactly a week,
and during that period it i as kept actmra'e time
—more so, indeed, than my own watch, which
cost a great deal more money. The Waterbary
Watch is a very simple contrivance. It will go
for two days with one winding up. is keyless, and
very easily regulated. I have tested the watch
thoroughly, and have nothing but good to say cf it.
It is made of nickel silver, and co-ting only a trifle,
supplies a capital timekeeper for boys and work-
men. The Waterbury Company have opened a
branch in Glasgow at 259, Argyle street, and
those who want a cheap watch, an accurate time-
keeper, and one that will bear a deal of handling
with impunity, will find than the money so spent
on the new invention will not be money thrown
away.”
Everybody says the same thing about the Water-
bury, and in almost the same words, and what
everybody says must be true. At any rate it is
true as far as the Waterbury is concerned; bub
whenever yon meet the proprietor of one who is
more than usually enthusiastic about it, you will
be pretty safe in concluding that his ardor is the
ardor of a convert. He went out of his way for a
long time to abu=e it, was eventually persuaded
to buy one. and now ho has as much to say in its
favour as the ninety and nine who have regulated
all their private and business engagements by the
Waterbury since its first introduction to Austra-
lia. Its principle merits may bo summed up in a
few words - accuracy, low cost, simplicity. It is
a handsome watch to look at, a splendid watch to
go, and as it only contains 57 parts, all told, it
can be repaired when necessary at a lower cost
than any other watch yet invented. People on
the look-out for something useful for themselves,
or for a valuable present to give their friends,
should think over this opportunity and rot be in
too much of a hurry in making up their minds.
The price of the Waterbury is the same every-
where in the colonies-13s. 6d ; it can be bought
generally from all dea?e-s and storekeepers, or
wholesale from Messrs. T. Willis and Co.; Feld-
helm, Gothelf and Co., and S. Hoffnung and Co,
The address of the Waterbury Watch Repair De-
pot is 56, Margaret-street, Sydney.
PREDICTIONS FOR 1888.
The signs of the times are plain enough for any-
one who chooses to run and read. The advertising
“mediums” and their thuraby packs of loul-
smelliog cards are no longer The
seeker after knowledge has but to keep his eyes
open. At the Anneal Convention of the Photo-
graphers Association of America, held in the Ex-
position Building, Chicago, 111,, in August last,
Judge Bradwell, of the Legal News, in his
address said, amongst ether things “I predict
that it will net be long before in all the pulpits in
the country the camera will ha brought into re-
quisition, and the sermons throughout the land
will be illustrated with the magic lantern. How
In the world can a minister drive home to the poor
backshding sinner the beauties of salvation aqd
■the terrors of damnation better than by Illustra-
tions that he can bring before his congregation
with the magic lantern ? In fact, there is one of
rout ministers - as the press of Sunday last in-
iformed us-in one of our suburbs illustrating his
sermons that way, and his church is one of the
most popular. He can hardly take in the money
fast enough when they pass round the hat, and he
illustrates the hymns which are sung, and it has a
very good effect).” Predictions about the State
House, the proposed change of name for the
colony, the possib’e duration of the Pa-kes
Ministry, and tbelr probable successors have been
repeatedly made durirg the past few wteks ; but
the one prediction which stands out above all
others, and the one which will inevitably prove
true, is that Clausen’s New York Champagne
Lager E’er will go on increasing its grip on the
Australian people so surely and effectively that
there will shortly be no question about the exis-
tence of any of the unwholesome imitations of
Lager Beer with which the market is periodically
ewamped. The genuine Clausen’s Lager can be
ordered from Messrs, Mason Brothers limited,
Fesq and Co , Tooth and Co , Allt and Co., Bur-
rows and Gleeson, Lucas Brothers, R. Butcher
and Co , J- T and J. Toohey and Co., Tidswell,
Wilson, and Co., A Thompson and Co., C, Bath

Some airy individual advertises In the
S.M. Herald :
‘ ‘ yy ANTED, Devil for Teasing Hair.”
“Cheap and reliable second-hand fiend” will be
the next thing we suppose. Or else “ Favour-
able opening for demon with good testimonials.”
"The Revenue was never more abundant or easily collected.”— GOVERNOR LOCH’S SPEECH .
At the breaking-up of a Bathurst (N. S. W.)
Public-school, when a number of giggling girls
came up to receive their rewards from the chair-
man of local school boarJs (Mr. Suitor), that
dignitary giddily declared that he “ wished he
could have kissed the fair performers all at once.”
This gashing confession gives rise to two queries :
What size is Sutler’s mouth 1 and why doesn’t he
kiss the girls one by one as an ordinary man has
to do ?
Camden Times threatens to publish a list
°f all accounts due to it over 12 months. Th
delinquents don’t mind. It is quite the oorreo
caper to owe money now-a-days in N.S.W. As
Premier Parkes observes: “ Honour does not con-
sist in paying 20 shillings in the pound."
Archbishop Carr (R. 0.) held a Confirma-
tion service at Yea (Vic,), the other day—admis-
sion by five and ten-shilling tickets. Such of the
faithful as failed to muster the “ five bob ” had to
worry on without the Papal benediction, “ Un-
blessed are the poor.”—Revised Version.

The
‘POTSHOT*
Camera,
IS the Latest Novelty in the Photographic World. It is small, strong, very simple, handsomely got
up, and atrociously effective both on friends and on enemies. Six circular pictures, each about the
size of a crown piece, can be taken on one plate with most astonishing speed and perfect accuracy.
This Camera can be worn under a coat or dress, the lens projecting through a button-hole cannot be
observed, and the simple action of pulling a cord hands down to either reverence or ridicule every
incident included within the scope of its vision. The “POTSHOT” Camera is not a toy but a
really serviceable instrument of the class known as “DETECTIVE” Cameras. At the same time
an immense amount of fun can be got out of it, and photographs of people and things obtained with
ease which are practically impossible by any other method. A limited number only have been
Imported by us, and they are well worth the attention of the general public.
