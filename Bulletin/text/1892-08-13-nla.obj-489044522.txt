Their Cause, Symptoms, and Treatment.
This pamphlet is specially written to show a method of
counteracting the ill effects of indiscretions in early life,

ful information for every sufferer from the following com-
plaints, viz Loss of Energy and Will Power, NERVOUS

Contagious Diseases, and various other symptoms experi-
enced by Nervous Sufferers.
This Pamphlet is seat Free on Application,
and all in any way suffering from the above would derive
benefit from the perusal of this work.
If the patient’s case is of long standing, and, therefore
in need of treatment, he should lose no time in writing
me a letter detailing in full his symptoms, on receipt of
which I will at once reply, explaining the nature of his
complaint, and if I can effect a cure, the time it will take,
and the cost of doing so. My long experience in the
treatment of Nervous Diseases has made me thoroughly
conversant with all their peculiarities. I am prepared,
therefore, to
Guarantee a Permanent and Complete Cure in every case I undertake.
I invite the fullest investigation into my qualifications. For some time I was House Surgeon to the Great
Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of investigating the causes of Nervous Diseases, and
become perfectly acquainted with the most approved scientific and successful methods of affecting their cure,

Frustration of Grab.
Settle the people on the land ! The public of
New South Wales is sick of the phrase. Every
time it has been trumpeted out, in the past, it
has been followed by a tremendous sequestra-
tion of lands out of the reach of settlors. In
1860 the squatters were despotic monopolists.
The mere populace they treated as an inferior
race, to whom they denied, when living, the
privilege of holding or using even as much
ground as, after death, was conceded to them
for graves. Supported by their bankers, their
storekeepers, by their importing and exporting
agents, by the miscellaneous crowd of parasites,
commercial and social, who invariably attach
themselves to wealth, thej' confidently believed
that they could indefinitely hold at bay a whole
people, stung with earth-hunger, just as to-day
the capitalistic class flatter themselves that,
with the same kind of support, they will be
able to suppress, till the end of time, the
upheavals of a proletariat starving for decent
housing, a taste of the elegances of life, and
ease of mind as to the morrow and as to pro-
vision for old age. The squatting class failed,
just as the capitalist class will—despite the
transient triumphs of the moment —succumb in
the near future. The fruits of victory were
filched from the people, owing to the ridiculous
use made of the opportunity by Mr. John"
Robertson. Heedless of everything but the
convenience of outbidding every competitor for
leadership, Robertson inflicted upon the pro-
vince the most preposterous land-law ever con-
ceived by the mind of man; and, after a
moment of dismay, the squatter recovered his
spirits on perceiving that the bill, which was
apparently designed to destroy his monopoly,
could be converted into a means of embastioning
it. A flood of chicanery and fraud inundated
the country. Men who had intended to become
settlers and users of the soil speedily perceived
that it was more profitable to speculate in land
than to cultivate it. The squatter developed
into the freeholder, and the dummy acquired
cash. United in interest, the two classes made
Jack Robertson their idol, and were powerful
enough to resist every tendency towards correc-
tion of the vices of the new law. Vast areas
bought with borrowed funds have passed into
the possession of British money-lenders, and
while unscrupulous individuals were enriched
by trafficking instead of cultivating, the hoped-
for structure of national prosperity and common
integrity was laid out on a rotten foundation.
I lie evil remains unrepaired to the present
day. No public man has yet presented himself
■with sufficient intelligence and force of charac-
ter to emancipate the province from the influ-
ences due to the stupendous blunder of Sir
John Robertson. A long series of alleged
Land Ministers has since held office, each only
more commonplace than the other, when
personal corruption did not confer a sinister
distinction. Unfortunately, the ablest have
not been the most distinguished for integrity.
It first became safe in a political sense to offer
a reform at the time when the Rarkes and the
Robertson factions had become equally dis-
credited, and the weary colonists of New South
Wales looked with an eye of hope upon a batch
of new men. The task of reform fell upon the
feeble shoulders of the late Mr. Tarn eel, and,
as might have been anticipated, the out-
come of his mind was an enactment
which did not touch the roots of the
evil. Dummy ism continued as rampant as ever.
The inadequacy of this lawmaking became im-
mediately apparent, and within five years the
public disappointment became clamorous, and
the great trust of repairing the mischief
devolved by evil chance upon the smug and
self-complacent Drunker, a man intimately
versed in all the intricacies of the preceding
local enactments, but otherwise ignorant. To
expect anything vigorous or original from a
person of the Drunker kind would have been
fatuous. Of principles neither natural parts
nor study had conferred upon him the faintest
glimmering conception. Accordingly he became
the sponsor of a patchwork measure which
simply gave expression to the political expedi-
ency of the hour. It was a time when, in the
predominating and critical struggle between
Freetraders and Protectionists, the pastoral
tenants and their business allies, through their
representatives in Parliament, held the balance
of power, just as the Labour-members did at a
later date. Before this influential group, Land
Minister Drunker abjectly grovelled, with the
consequence that more than half the province
was handed over to them for the life time of a
generation, and that they secured concessions
with respect to compensation for improvements,
the burden of which is only now becoming fully
recognised. The trumpery character of the
exploits of Farnell and Drunker can be best
understood by consideration of a statement of
the nett results achieved in the direction of
fostering settlement and frustrating monopoly.
From the time when Farnell paltered with
reform up to the close of last year, holders of
land in areas rai/ging from 100 to 1000 acres
increased in number from 17,792 to 22,270, that
is to say, at the rate of 25 per cent. This may,
with some reservation on the ground that the
increase comprises areas selected by dummies
but not transferred up to last year, be
accepted as the increase of real settle-
ment. Dub during the same period the
number of holders of areas ranging from
10,000 acres upwards increased from 463
persons to 677, which is at the rate of 50
per cent. So that under the precious legisla-
tion fathered by Farnell and Drunker, the
progress of monopoly has been double that
made by real settlement. This flagrant failure
is sti!* more emphatically brought home to
people when the aggregate of the areas held by
those two classes of persons is considered. The
former hold 7,924,862 acres, the latter
21,844,299 acres, out of which they cultivate
37,329 acres, if that can be called cultivation
which requires but a single exertion of human
labour—planting artificial grasses.
* # *
If further demonstration of the utter failure
of the New 7 South Wales land laws to accom-
plish that which they were designed to effect—
the development of agriculture—be needed, it
can be given. In 1862, when Robertson’s Act
came into operation, of every 100 bushels of
wheat consumed by the people of New South
M ales, 67 bushels were of home growth, and
only 33 imported. In 1891, after the great
alleged reform by Robertson, and the tinkering
by Farnell and Drunker, out of 100 bushels
consumed, the province grew 47 and imported
53. So that during the first period the agricul-
turists of New South Wales produced two-
thirds of the wheat used in the province, while
during the second period they produced less
than one-half ! Here we have exemplified the
effects of Freetrade and Freetrade land legis-
lators. Again, in 1883, there were 850,017 acres
under crop, and in 1891, during which period
the Freetraders held the reins of power and
governed as they thought best, the quantity
had fallen to 846,383 acres, a decrease of nearly
4000 acres. Once more ; Up to the end of 1891
there have been alienated 45,800,000 acres, and
thedeclared object of aIIN.S.W. land legislation,
the fostering of agriculture, has been so little
attained, that out of that vast quantity, the
area converted from merely grazing uses
to actual cultivation has only reached
846,383 acres, or about one acre out of live.
Hence the object of the land-laws—for it was
never contemplated to alienate land simply for
grazing—has been ineffectual to the extput of
four-fifths.
* * *
The remedy for the concentration of huge
freeholds has long been plain enough ; but as
its application would have brought upon the
minister proposing it the antagonism of the two
powerful classes of monopolists and of profes-
sional dummies, the impostors who have hereto-
fore grimaced in the role of land-law reformers
have never had the honesty to confess what they
perceived, or the courage to propose it. Simply
to make the conditions of residence attach, not
only to the first selector of a piece of land, but
to the land itself, if transferred, for an extended
period—if not in perpetuity—would prove an
effectual bar to trafficking in land for the pur-
poses of building up huge grazing freeholds. If
it were enacted tint no person or corporation,
al eidy in possession of the aggregate area in
any division of the province which can be legally
selected therein, shall be permitted to acquire
additional aieas, an extensive class of monopo-
-1 s s would be baulked at once. There can be no
essential difference between limiting the area
widen a man may select, and limiting the area
which a man may hold in fee simple, "if it is in
piincij li wrong to ask it must be equally wrong
to have. Five years isa sufficient term' during
which an industrial tenant should he compelled
to reside on his land. Liberty to enjoy the
fruits of his exertions is not only a fair recog-
nition of his temporary restraint, but may be
beneficially employed in relation to the public
welfare. Travel opens the mind, and comparison
of industrial methods in diverse localities is a
useful education for the agriculturist. It
would certainly tend to contract the selling
piice of selections upon which conditions had
been fulfilled if none could buy save such per-
sons as ditl not already hold land to a fixed
extent. And if it were enacted that a second
term of live years residence upon selections had
to be observed by any person acquiring same
from the original selector, the employment of
dummies would become too cosily, too compli-
cated by risks, and too protracted a process to
be continued as at present. The law-makers
have heretofore always professed themselves to
be confounded by a dilemma. If, they plead,
the price of land be made high, selection is
retarded, and the selector is loaded with an
outlay in deposit and rent which cripples his
means for improvement and development of his
holding. But if, on the other hand, the price
be fixed at a low figure, inducements to dummy-
ing and trafficking become almost irresistible. If
the conditions of residence and perhaps even of
cultivation were made in a degree continuous
and progressive, one horn of that dilemma
would be knocked off at a stroke. The early
payments by selectors could be reduced to a
figure merely nominal and sufficient to act as a
prevention against trifling. The right of use
and of acquisition would remain intact, but the
opportunity of trafficking would be destroyed, so
far as it is detrimental to the welfare of the
community.
» * «
While the pastoral tenant perverts the laws
which were colourably intended to displace him
for the convenience of the agriculturist and the
benefit of the State, and employs them as means
for entrenching himself behind a freehold
tenure, he none the less actively intrigues to
stave off the termination of his lease. The
lessees in the Western Division succeeded in so
playing on the political sensibilities of Mr.
Bkl NKER that they secured with his help an
extra extension of seven years—making twenty-
seven altogether. Their brethren in the Cen-
tral Division are at the present moment, and
have been for some time past, busily engaged in
endeavouring to concoct some device by means
of which they may postpone the evil day fast
approaching when their leases will terminate.
The rabbits arc their dearest friends at this
juncture. Some time ago they earwigged the
sympathetic and facile Drunker, and so
managed him with their tale of rabbits and woe
that he actually gave 60 days’ notice in the
Government Gazette that it was his intention
to proclaim the whole of the country comprised
within the electorates of the Hume and Murray
as infested with rabbits, under the Act. The
utmost consternation was created among the
farmers and selectors of the districts by this in-
timation. Their members repaired to the
Minister and let him understand plainly that
the object of the move was just as well under-
stood by the selectors as it could be in the
Lands Office. The design of the squatters was
to fence in their runs with wire-netting, com-
pelling the selectors to become, under the con-
straint of the Rabbit Act, unwilling contri-
butors to the cost. This “ improvement ” having
been effected, the pastoral lessees would
thereby become entitled to an extension for
live years of their leases. The members for
these districts having, however, protested that
the rabbits there were but few, and had not
increased during ten years, Mr. Brunker had
to hold his hand. More recently Mr. Copeland
has been approached on behalf of the squatters
with the same object, and heaven and earth are
being moved to avert the termination of the
leases. Labour and city members are carted
through various parts, free of expense, and,
during the severest months of winter, when
all vegetation is dormant, are shown tracts
devoid of the verdure of the spring and summer
seasons, and are told in tones of despair that
what is really due to season is attributable to
the terrible rodents. They are told of aban-
doned runs, and again rabbits are accused of
being the authors of the great convenience
of holding a run without paying rent
for it. The sympathetic, syndicate-ridden
daily press is filled up to the muzzle with
doleful rabbit-stories, and when, despite of
all exertions, the embarrassing fact becomes
apparent that rabbits have almost disappeared
where once they were in multitudes, recourse
is had to lamentable predictions that they are
only gammoning and will re appear anon.
* # #
There has been sufficient fooling with the
rabbits already to serve one generation. J. P.
Abbott’s ridiculous Bill was so dismal a failure,
after costing both squatter and State great
sums of money, that even its author had to con-
fess it worse than impotent. The pastoral
tenant, with his contracted tenure and ex-
pansive area, has been demonstrated in-
capable of coping with the vermin when
their increase is normal. No one but a squatter
resolute to ignore any fact which makes against
pcrpctuance of his cheap hold upon the land,
can affect to be ignorant, at this stage of the
business, that it is only by comparatively close
settlement that the rabbits can be exterminated.
The people of New South Wales will watch
with jealous and rigid scrutiny the development
of the new conspiracy to secure for the squatters
of the Central Division an extension of their
nearly expired leases. Members who may
show that they have been hoodwinked by
unseasonable visits, or softened by blandish-
ments will be marked by their constituents, and
when the day of reckoning comes will find that
a short shrift awaits men who are lacking in
the “irons ” to detect imposture or deficient of
the strength of character to resist the seduc-
tions of the would-be monopolists of the
territory.
Wanted—A Revised Tariff.
It is one of the stereotyped complaints of the
Foreign-trade party and the Foreign-trade press
that there is no finality in Protection. Nearly
every country that is protected wants more
Protection, and, having got it, wants still more.
The United States has increased its tariff )
degrees until at last it has reached wlm •
practically prohibition. France has been,
more and more protective almost every v ' lle
since it abolished the Empire and the Frectri U
system together. Maoriland is a heavily.,,; u
tec ted state, and Premier Ballance is alrea I°'
promising a large increase in customs dutilf
In Victoria the Shills Cabinet has decided i
nearly double many of the existing protecth°
imposts, and there is no possible guarantee tlm°
in another year, it may not double them actin’
and even then the process may be no nearer i ’
end than it is now. By a peculiarly idioi
process of inverted logic, this tendency t
pointed out by the Foreign-trade press as in
unanswerable proof that the system is alto
gether evil and ruinous. Every nation, excepting
possibly England, which has once adopted p ro :
tection, demands more of it—therefore it
bad ; no nation ever demands more Freetrade-
therefore, it is good. The universal craving f or
know edge peace, or liberty shows distinctly
that these things are commendable, but the crav-
ing forenbauced tariffs shows that they are utterly
nefarious and ought to be abolished. There-
fore, whenever it is announced that some country
wants new restrictions on cheap, slave-made
imports the doleful cry goes up that there is no
finality in Protection, as if anyone ever
expected or desired that there should be any
finality in it, any more than in piety or civilisa-
tion or the diffusion of knowledge or any other
jtom that makes up human progress.
& & #
Victoria lias now enjoyed a certain measure
ol I retention for a quarter of a century, and
the industries which were created by 'that
policy arc—so the Foreign-trade press asserts
no more able to stand without it to-day than
they were when the tariff was first invented
This fact—for no doubt it is a fact—is put
forward as an ineoutestible proof that Protec-
tion is a hideous mistake, and its authors regard
their pet argument with a certain fatuous pride
because it is too obvious to be disputed. The
Bulletin, at all events, cedes the"point cheer-
fully. The industries which were created in
Victoria by Protection, which would never
have existed but for Protection, and which have
lived by Protection ever since they first started,
mostly require to be protected as much as ever
they did—in fact, many of them require it even
more. Also, the chances are that they will
continue to want Protection for an indefinite
period—in fact, The Bulletin sees no reason
why they shouldn’t want it to all eternity.
For one of the principal factors in production
is wages, and so long as wages are higher in
Australia than they are among the hard-driven
slaves of Europe and Asia —so long as
tills country strives to keep even a hair’s-
breadth above the cast-iron law of elcvenpence-
balfpenny a day, and its industries are not run
by cheap Hebrew sweaters, and its artisans
want to work eight hours per diem instead of
fourteen so long it must have Protection to
keep the balance even, else these advantages
must needs fade away. It suits the Foreign-
trade press to assume that the principle was
only intended, even by its own warmest advo-
cates, as a temporary expedient to prop up new
industries until they were able to dispense with
its support, and on this false assumption is
built up the false inference that Protection is a
failure because the years go by and the world is
still unable to do without it. The entire theory
is a self-evident lie. Protection was intended
to go on for ever—or atleast until cheap-labour,
sweating, and slavery are entirely abolished,
and shoddy is a defunct institution, and there
are no more cheap imports to be shut out. If
it is a failure because the adoption of Protec-
tion for twenty-five years hasn’t enabled Vic-
toria to do without Protection, then food is
also a failure, because every Freetrader we
know of has used it all his life and is no nearer
doing without it to-day than when he first
started. And concerning the fact that Protec-
tion has no finality, and all countries that have
once established a tariff want more and still
more tariff, it can only be assumed that they
want more of it because they have found it
beneficial; and as no nation seems to want more
Freetrade, any more than it wants more cholera
and hanging and locusts and sudden death, it
would naturally appear that these things have
all been tried and found equally objectionable.
* * *
The experience of New South Wales in this
matter is identical with that of the rest of the
world —it lias enjoyed a little Protection and it
wants much more. So far, the Dibbs Govern-
ment has not exhibited the courage of its con-
victions. It has signified its adhesion to a cer-
tain faith on which it believes in order that it
may he saved—in a fiscal sense; hut apparently
it only wants to he saved to a limited extent,
and is content to he lost for the balance. So far,
The Bulletin has lent a certain measure of
support to the Dibbs Cabinet because even the
first beginnings of Protection were better than
the mongrel policy of alleged Freetrade
practised by Parkes and his followers, but it
has never regarded the present New South
W ales tariff as more than the mere shadow of
the creed which the Government is understood
to profess. The free list, in the first place, is a
mockery. The alleged purpose of the tariff is
to promote every industry which can be carried
on in the country, and the list contains several
dozen items which ought to be subjected to a
heavy duty upon this principle. Such imports
as antimony, elastic hoots, buckles, building
stone, chains, charcoal, copper, cotton
goods, firewood, fish, flax, meat, hides, hog-
skins, lead ore, limestone, matches, paper,
pipes and tubes, tallow, and many others,
cannot, by any stretch of reason or logic, he
admitted free to a protected country. They
are all things which can he grown, or mined, or
manufactured in New South Wales, and the
business of the Government is to impose a tax
on every article which is needlessly imported
into the country. And in the second place, the
duties—ranging from 10 up to about 20 per
cent which are imposed under the two
schedules of the tariff are not Protection hut
only an apology for it, and a tolerably abject
one at that. They were imposed, apparently,
by way of “inserting the thin end of the
wedge ” —that favourite expression of mediocre
politicians who regard it as a sign of wisdom to

income derived would be from those taxes
which were charged, tor revenue purposes, on
articles which the country could not grow or
manufacture for itself. The measure of a suc-
cessful tariff is the amount that it does not
produce. In this respect the M'Kinley scheme,
in the United States, may be classed as the best
in modern times, inasmuch as it has enormously
reduced the amount paid by the people in
Customs imposts, and the exactions made under
this, the strictest protective policy on earth,
are ’ now —-per head of the population
considerably less than those made in Eng-
land under the anomaly which is ironi-
cally termed “ Freetrade.” The Victorian
tariff has, so far, been only moderately success-
ful ; the duties were, in many cases, not high
enough to be prohibitory, and, as a result, they
have cost the Victorian people just as -much_ as
the Freetrade system has cost those of New
South Wales. The kind of Protection which
costs as much in Customs duties as Freetrade
is only a modified triumph at the Lastly,
the protective tariff of New South W ales, like
that of Queensland, has been still less beneficial,
as the increased revenue which it still produces
will demonstrate. This evidence is absolutely
conclusive. The protective tariff which does
not tend to steadily diminish the takings of the
Customs House is too half-hearted to be of
much account.
• * *
If the New South Wales Government is in
earnest, it will devote itself at the earliest
possible moment to a revision of the tariff, and
take the shortest road that circumstances will
permit towards M'Kinleyism. Protection
which is not practically prohibition is of little
value. The present duties are just high enough
to give a feeble support to a few industries,
and just low enough to prevent them coming to
that stage of perfection which is required to
make their products cheap and of good quality.
When something of this sort was pointed out to
Treasurer See, he endeavoured to define his
position by explaining that the Government
had not attempted to formulate a system of
“scientific Protection.” This statement ex-
presses exactly the manner in which the Dibbs
Cabinet has misunderstood its position. It was
created for the express purpose of formulating
a system of scientific Protection. The country
wanted the most perfect article of the kind
which could be procured, and the Dibbs
Government was understood to be the legisla-
tive artificer which could supply that want. If
it cannot do so, or if it can, but will not make
the attempt, it must give way to some com-
bination that is better qualified for the under-
taking. When Treasurer See hir - es an artisan
to make a table, and hears that person, after
hideously botching the work, explain that he
didn’t attempt to do it on scientific principles,
he will understand exactly how the country
feels towards the statesmen who were sent into
office to construct a genuinely protective tariff,
didn’t think it worth while making the
attempt.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Doctors’ Fees.
Mr. Melville, a comparatively Radical and
outspoken member of the Victorian Legislative
Louncil, has raised the dander of the Argus by
ulvocating a reasonable restriction of the
scale of medical charges for which suffering
humanity i s subject to be sued. The organ of
monopolies maintains—and, unfortunately, not
without truth—that it is almost impossible to
, x a maximum price for services sought under
the circumstances peculiar to a sick room, and
0 check the rapacity of men whose skill is an
Wide supposed to have few, or no, equals in
ic market. A sinking millionaire, with the
L ' ar of Sheol before his glassy eyes, will clutch
« a certain doctor, just as the drowning indi-
vutual of metaphor clutches at straws, even
tough that doctor demand two hundred
guineas for stretching out his hand to save.
rUl ' ant physicians and surgeons may be com-
P‘ cn to large diamonds. The small stones
;, v ® a tolerably well-defined value per carat,
c„ ls t the gigantic gems command “fancy”
m o out of all proportion to their weight
-an! SCale> But, admitting that the law
nn °t prevent the possibility of Shy-
lock, M. 1)., practising extortion upon un-
happy clients (other than people of large
means) in their hour of trouble, there is
still no reason why a community shouldn’t enjoy
a measure of protection against a profession
which enables its professors to be the worst of
enemies in the guise of the best of friends. Why
should the fee for amputating a limb be, by the
rules of the trade, a more desirable considera-
tion than the fee for preserving that limb to the
patient, so that every surgeon in monetary
difficulties is always longing for an opportunity
to maim somebody for life ? Heaven only knows
how many Victorian legs and arms were wil-
fully butchered to make champagne holidays
for that extravagant Roman, the late Beaney.
And supposing that the expert operator in ques-
tion didn’t sacrifice one unnecessary piece of
the public in his greed for gold and advertise-
ment (which meant more gold in the future),
the fact remains that the removal of a human
“member” is an undue benefit to the
party who does the trick, and the tempta-
tion to make a big gory job of a small
job is so painfully apparent as to seem to call
for a legislative something to be done. Let the
maximum price of an amputation be fixed at
ten guineas—what honest gentleman can desire
more for half-a-day’s work ? —and nobody will
suffer except the manufacturers of cork legs
and arms, and the melancholy crutch industry.
Here, at least, might Parliament put in its
spoke to good purpose. For the rest, there is not
much hope of a reasonable doctor-tariff, save in
that growth of competition which will place
ordinary home-curing within the reach of all but
the poorest, and the poorest must continue, we
suppose, to be cured in a more or less experi-
mental way at the hospital. A bill to stop doctors
from backing ’osses might smack of interference
with the liberty of the subject, although auch a
measure would indeed point a useful moral. It
is the obvious duty of the world to discounten-
ance expensive habits in medical men, and to
look with suspicion upon the garish Samaritan
whose establishment requires a terrible lot of
keeping up. The world, being a hopeless fool,
however, will not perform this simple duty, any
more than it will avoid the error of patronising
a conscienceless solicitor for the sake of the im-
posing staff of clerks who are supported on the
proceeds of his robberies. No, the successful,
showy bloodsucking leech must continue to
enjoy a far greater reputation than he deserves,
whilst the really good men of the profession
who would sooner give a patient health than
take a fee, anyway, are accumulating most of
their riches in Heaven.
Bibbs’ Seat of Honour.
A gkand banquet in honour of “ Sir George ”
Dibbs is being cooked, and a lot of people are
preparing to stuff and swill by the light of the
gorgeous insignia of the new knight as soon as
those dazzling decorations shall illuminate the
territory of New South Wales. The affair is
to be ostensibly to congratulate Sir George
upon the success achieved in his mission to
England. We don’t deny the success. Granted
that the London Times gave him a send-off on
his departure from England by condoling with
him on the failure of his attempt to get the
authorities in London to entertain the idea of
allowing the investment of trust-funds in Aus-
tralian securities ; and granting again that the
money-changers have been unmoved by the
dubbing of Dibbs at Osborne, and obdurate even
when apprised that the Prince of Wales gave
him a cigar of dimensions as protracted as
Dibbs’ own, and that they would probably have
remained unmoved even had the Heir to the
Throne bitten off the end of the cigar for Dibbs
as alleged pretty girls do at a church-bazaar—
still we assent to the proposition that Dibbs has
attained the object of his visit to England. It
is quite clear now that what Dibbs went to seek
was the knighthood—and he has got it. The
farce of coyness which he performed with Lord
Knutsford imposes upon no one. It is too
stale. Donna Julia with Don Juan in the
arbor went through precisely the same form of
resistance when she —
Whispering “I’ll ne’er consent,” consented.
There have lived a few republican nobles, and
some republican baronets. These titles being
hereditary, their bearers couldn’t help having
them, although they didn’t believe in them.
There used, indeed, to be a baronet in the
Mackay district in Queensland, years ago,
whose republicanism was so stiudy that he
refused to be addressed by his title at all. But
a republican, or even a democratic, knight is
an absurdity. The Sovereign never permits her-
self to be publicly snubbed : she knights people
nowadays only when assured, after sufficient
inquiry, either that they have been good
loyalists all along, or that their democratic
antecedents were as spurious as the madness of
the elder Brutus and assumed for similar
reasons, or that they could be bribed by a title.
We don’t care a rap which horn of the
trilemma Dibbs’ apologists select for him.
There they stand. Men like Chief-Justice
Darley, who never pretended to be either a
Republican or a Democrat, and who talked
of “stamping out” such opinions—by Saint
Bartholomew ! imagine a man in the nine-
teenth century talkirfg of stamping out opinions
can accept titles Vvftthout further disgracing
themselves. But men like Graham Berry,
and, in a less degree, Dibbs (who, like G. H.
Reid, never professed democratic tendencies
till political expediencies seemed to make that a
clear necessity), simply strip themselves naked
of principle and roll in the gutter of indecent
self-exposure when they submit to be tacked on
to the aristocracy. They confess by their con-
sent that they would rather be a patch on the
seat of the pantaloons of the aristocratic prin-
ciple than a wreath on the brow of democracy.
That is just what Dibbs has achieved. He is
established in the seat of honour and every true
Republican will oblige him with the kick which
such a situation invites.

Another “Shirt-Sleeved Caesar.”
“ Slaves cannot breathe in England.” Lovely
bit of bunkum by the poet Cowper, who
meant it, however. It is true in a degree.
England is brim-full of white slaves who can
hardly manage to breathe. But that is because
they are huddled into courts and alleys and
cellars and garrets so foul that slave-owners
would be almost asphyxiated in them. The
very temple of British liberty is the Legislative
Chamber of the British “ Commons,” but
Speaker Peel has just made it official law that
a British commoner has no right there unless
he submit to pretend that he is not a common
man at all. If he be not “ a gentleman lie
must assume at least some of the uniform of
that order. Now, the “ upper classes ’’ in
England have a regular set of insignia for State
occasions, just as the peers have special robes or
coronets which they have to wear at a coronation.
Every Eton boy has to wear a bell-topper, and
a bell-topper is the coronet of the “gentleman "’
on all occasions of ceremony. In the House of
Commons, members have a constitutional right
-—which has a special political significance
we needn’t enlarge upon just now —to sit
covered. But Speaker Peel has just pro-
nounced to be disorderly a “common” per-
son, a newly-elected Labour member of the
Commons, for being covered with a tweed cap
instead of a bell-topper. This imposition of the
aristocratic sumptuary law on the Commons
will yet lead to consequences. If a bell-topper
be the only permissible head-covering in the
House, what about wigs ? It is evident that
Speaker Peel winced at the inroads on the
constitution symbolized by Labour member
Hardie’s coat of— terrible thing this! —-
blue serge, and that Mr. Hardxe’s uncollared
shirt of flannel has thrown Great Britain
into consternation. These horrible mani-
festations make us fear the worst. We
apprehend, with breathless anxiety, that
Speaker Peel may yet ascertain that Mr.
Hardie’s singlet was not “ all wool at six-and-
six,” and that he wore no socks ! The whole
thing is too revolting and irreligious for con-
templation. It constitutes an outrage on the
feelings of “every right-thinking” person in
Great Britain, where the sentiments of that
predominant and respectable class enters even
into nursery rhymes and the very children
chant that—
“lf you don’t wear a collar and a tie
You won’t go to Heaven when you die.”
Who are the Sweaters?
It is popular to suppose that sweating is
confined to industries where the original con-
tractor, retaining a substantial profit, sub-lets
at a lower figure to another contractor, who
may again sub-let his contract after a like
pecuniary retention. In consequence of these
deductions, made before any work has been
done, a contract, originally let at a figure that
would pay remunerative wages, ultimately falls
into someone’s hands at such a low figure that
there is no room for further sub-letting, no chance
of paying those who do the work anything but
starvation wages, and starvation wages they are
paid. This is probably the most aggravated, but
it is not the only form of sweating. The great
employer of labour, the man who has almost
a monopoly of some industry, whether produc-
tive or distributive, being able to give per-
manent employment, can always command
underpaid labour with an over-stocked market
at hand. And where one employer sweats his
wage-hands the custom is likely to become
general. But the sweating habit does not end
with the employer. The “ sweated ” themselves
become sweaters, their necessities compel them
to eke out the miserable pittance called “salary,”
“ wages,” “pay,” or any other term that custom
may invent to describe a miserable livelihood—
to the best advantage. Therefore they buy in
the cheapest market, just as their labour is
bought in the cheapest market. Thus buying,
the distributor who purchases from a producer
who pays fair wages is forced ultimately
by unfair competition either to purchase
a “ sweated ” article, or to adulterate in
order to sell cheaply. By these means, one
cheap-selling tradesman has power to lower the
wage standard of the whole community, and
while monopoly exists neither Trades Unionism
nor Adulteration Acts can save the nation that
delighteth in cheap goods from the curse of
shoddy commodities and a ground-down
proletariat. The lives of human beings are
bought and sold over the counter as well as
bartered away in the counting-room.
Men used to be flogged to death ; now we are
satisfied to flog them into the lunatic asylum.
From the Argus (3rd Aug.): —
At Coburg Police-court yesterday, a young man named
Henry Frederick Myler was charged with lunacy. > He
had just completed serving a sentence of six months’ im-
prisonment, and undergoing during his incarceration two
Hoggings, each of 15 lashes, for committing an assault on
a little girl at Carlton, the sentence having been inflicted
by the Carlton Bench. At the expiration of the term,
and on being discharged from Pentridge, he was given
into the charge of the Coburg police by the Stockade
authorities, as during his custody in the prison he had
developed into a dangerous lunatic. It is considered that
the severity of the floggings—SO lashes-being given
within so short a period, added to the confinement, had
unhinged his mind. The prisoner was committed to
Yarra Bend Asylum.
And the most brutal part of this unspeakably
bestial business is, that the odds are it was
the wretched Myler’s diseased brain which
prompted him to the offence for which the law
skinned him alive.
New South Wales Full Court last week passed
some severe and unanimous strictures on the
“gross ignorance” of his magisterial duties
exhibited by Stipendiary Magistrate Benjamin
Lee, of Sydney, in passing on one Carraway,
a sentence which their Honors promptly
quashed. Mr. Lee, by the way, is the S.M.
who not long ago inflicted a Draconian and
utterly illegal sentence on some unfortunate
sailors who differed in opinion with certain
marine surveyors as to whether a vessel, which
was to carry the crew’s lives, was or was not
seaworthy.' In the latest case, Carraway,
having obtained trade-credit from Edmund
Fischer, a Sydney tailor, had been arrested in
Brisbane (Q.) on a charge of having “ stolen”
an overcoat made by Fischer to his order.
Magistrate Lee had fined Carraway £lO, but,
as Judge Windeyer put it, “ he had ordered
the coat which he had found to be stolen to be
returned to the thief !” All three of the adju-
dicating judges declared that the magistrate,
and not the tailor, “ was responsible for the
miscarriage of justice,” yet their Honors ordered
the poor snip to pay the costs of appeal, and let
the beak off with a tongue-thrashing ! Benja*
min Lee is a typical sample of the class ot
Magistrates whom Minister O’Connor would
allow, when sitting alone, to sentence citizen:!
to the lash !

Melbourne Argus (italics ours) : —■
Several firms of railway contractors have made over-
tures to the Proprietary 00. to take contracts for the
stoping of the ore at about half the present rates. The
contractors would be prepared to find a sufficient number
of men to raise such a quantity of ore as might be speci-
fied, and also to protect the workers from interference by
the unions. These offers have not been seriously enter-
tained-, for the directors do not desire to drive the men
who have left work permanently from the mines, but they
indicate that, during these times of depression, whilst
public works in all the colonies are n irtually at a stand-
still, there are other resources which the owners may,
should it become absolutely necessary, avail themselves of.
Magnanimous mine-owners ! Tried friends of
their employes ! Pity melting in one eye and a
threatening wink in the other ! The Argus is
so used to catering for becalmed intelligences
that it expects its readers to believe that grasp-
ing dividend-mongers and relentless wage-
sweaters are too compassionate to grab at these
“several” chances of reducing their expendi-
ture by one-half. Also, the Argus appears to
have exclusive possession of this kind of in-
formation :
Numbers of pickets have contracted pneumonia, several
having already succumbed to the complaint. The bulk of
the patients in the hospital are suffering from pleurisy or
some other lung-disease.
Call lead-poisoning by any other name and it’s
just as fatal.

Minister Scttor’s recent decision that the
Government subsidy to Sydney School of Arts
will be withheld unless the committee cease to
hire the hall for “ variety” entertainments will
not be the less approved on consideration of
the plea that “ an experience of many years has
shown the committee that evening lectures
average a deficiency of at least £2 per week.”
The additional announcement on behalf of th 0
committee that “ except for occasional pur-
poses the large hall must remain closed,” will
doubtless be remembered by N.S. W, Legislative
Assembly when next the subsidy for the insti-
tution has to be voted. The entire tenor of
the committee’s remonstrances exhibits a mis-
apprehension of the character of their trust.
The School of Arts is not a commercial specu-
lation, and moneys disbursed for educational
objects in connection with it are not “lost.”
Tiiey are spent just as in the very essence of
the intent of the concern it is meant that its
funds should be spent. The province last
year laid out over three-quarters of a million
sterling on education. Yet no one has ever
been crass enough not even the London.
Financial Times, which makes a point of
cavilling at eveiy sort of Government expendi-
ture in Australia —that the sum so expended
was “ a loss.” If Sydney School of Arts can
only keep its doors open by the profits derived
from high-kicking displays and screaming nigger
farces, it had best shut up. At any rate, if a
State-subsidy is to be granted to holster up
stage entertainments, it should certainly he
apportioned to establishments where drama of
a more elevating tendency is presented. We
mean more elevating as regards the mind—not
the legs.
Sydney Echo has, since we called attention to
the severe snub it administered to its ma, the
S.M. Herald, for indelicacy in reference to the
Bishop of St. John’s escaping from a confla-
gration in his sacerdotal shirt and without
gaiters, repented of its exceeding nicety. Last
week the severity of its Podsnapian principles
was exposed to an unexpected test. It is an
article of the Herald-Echo faith that Queen
Victoria can do no wrong, and that members
of the Royal Family can scarcely do anything
improper. Therefore, when a cable arrived
relating how the Princess Beatrice, appar-
ently emulating the worthy Bishop of St.
John’s, had scampered from a conflagration in
her bedroom in her shirt, the Echo suppressed
its blushes and consented to publish the naked
truth. We may offer consolation to the Echo
by reminding it that there is the very loftiest
precedent for both the Bishop and the Princess,
inasmuch as when the Lord Chancellor arrived
in the middle of the night to announce to the
Princess Victoria that William IV. was
defunct, Her Gracious needed no flames to send
her darting out of bed lightly clad in her sh——
well, night-gown —and a shawl, and just as
innocent of gaiters as the Bishop of St. John s,
to clutch at the Crown. The Echo’s prudery
resembles the ravings of Mrs. Nickleby’s mad
wooer. It is all “ gas and gaiters.
Ab Bermuda lately, a man was drowned

A Bulletin correspondent wants to know
whether it is true that certain influential news-
papers have a “ black list ” in the sub-editor’s
room designating those persons whose views
having proved offensive to the proprietors, and of
whose communications or public speeches in future
no notice is to be taken. Finding that repeated
letters on current Dress observations were
studiously disregarded' our correspondent com-
posed two letters consisting of precisely similar
materials, but worded differently, in reply to cer-
tain misrepresentations of a political writer-.
The one he forwarded in the first place under his
ordinary pen-name, and the other, after a few
days interval, under a fictitious name and address.
The last one only duly appeared. _ As some time
ago the writer alluded in depreciatory terms to
the particular newspaper proprietor’s pet book,
and has never since been allowed to criticise
anything in the offended magnate’s publication,
he comes to the conclusion that it is a fact, and
that the impartiality of the daily press is a
grotesque fable.

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, August 10,1892.
My Dear Moorabinda,—
“Jane,” at the Imperial Opera House, on 6th inst.#
drew a full-fig circle to inaugurate the Kemble season—
though the demoralising tendency to black garments
rather spoilt the effect—Mrs. Burdekin’s box-party, for
instance, being quite an ink-blot on the proceedings. The
largest theatre-party included a lady (who, some people
say, is the best-dressed woman in Sydney) in a very pleas-
ing garment of grey brocade with great puffs for sleeves,
and trimmings of grey jet; a touch of magenta at the
waist was a needful bit of warmth, and diamond sprays
supplied the glitter. A modish, cabbage-green garment
in the same party fortunately had a front seat. Apropos,
three young ladies, also in the front row, had an
“Engaged” card placed conspicuously on the rail in front
of them—to discourage possible suitors, I suppose.
In the curtain-raiser, “ Uncle’s Will,” Mrs. Molyneux
raised her silvery voice in Sydney after an absence of
months, and looked very’ taking in a powder-pink tea-
gown. Also, her make-up was very human—one gets so
weary of the actress who is like a red, red rose ! In
“Jane,” Myra Kemble, who was heartily welcomed, had
much scope to clothe herself radiantly and wink the other
eye. “ Jane ” is a marvellous domestic, horn for better
things than milk-runs, judging by the trick of dress
which she seems to have when opportunity offers.
In the first act there is only a glimpse of Jane in a
brocade tail; hut act two reveals that adaptable slavey in
a dream of cream crepon, flowered in pink round the
hem, and contrasted in a heavenly manner with sky-blue
silk. Act three is played out in an ivory bengaline ball-
dress, cut en princesse, and made perfectly plain, with a
narrow ruche of gold silk round the hem, white gloves
and diamond ornaments ; a black velvet wing-cloak, lined
with yellow satin, set off this toney turn-out-to a marvel.
Miss Madge Corcoran, as Miss Norton, had nothing to do,
and did it very well in a yellow spot muslin gown ; never-
theless, she shared the evening’s floralities with Jane.
How better than a starring Dart it is to have a faithful
adorer. (Shakespeare !)
’ A certain actress I know tells a mild little yarn about a
family of queer little girls, who happened to be travelling
on the same boat with her from Maoriland. One was
sitting next to her on deck, and suddenly said, “I hear
Miss is on hoard ; I’d so like to see her.” “ I am
she,” said the fair mummer, when, to her astonishment,
the little oddity replied, severely, “ Well—none of your
tricks here, remember!”
I am here reminded of the odd way a Sidney pro-
fessional man (who made a sassiety marriage a little while
ago) was induced to break with a pretty souhrette (now
married), to whom he was desperately attached. He was
smitten, but his friends were, not, and they were wont to
waylay him, and point out how idiotic the whole thing
was ; and they used to call at ail hours of the day and
night with schemes for getting rid of her in their pockets,
until the professional man gave in to his friends’ opinions,
and mournfully broke with the lady. And on the day the
jewellery was returned he rushed forth and engaged
himself to a society girl with the pretty soubrette’s cast-
off ring ! All the women recognise it on her finger.
Sydney Government House might be called the social
copy-book for the way its lines are followed—but it’s
always a mystery to me why the girl who gets into the
saddle, and only just manages to hang on without the
aid of mane and tail—doesn’t follow the vice-regal example
and engage a ridiog-master to prevent her being a blot on
the landscape.
The Jersey children are very confident on horseback,
and their teacher—Sydney’s only riding-master, Mr.
Burslem, who has appeared to so much advantage in the
jumping-contests at the Agricultural ground—is delighted
with his pupils. Lord Jersey is having his daughters
taught in view ot their debut one day in the English
hunting-field. Mr. Burslem’s method is thorough, and
girls who have gone to him too timid to mount a clothes-
horse, have been heard enquiring the nearest way to a
buckjumper after he has had them in hand. Nowhere
does a woman—l am not talking about the hutter-tub
woman—show to greater advantage than on top of
a gee-gee—if she knows how to manage him—and nowhere
does she look such a miserable guy if her seat isn’t firm
and graceful. Yet almost any woman will climb into
Btirrup-Icather without the least preparation.
The facility with which Mr. Burslem’s lady-pupils
marry (if they want to) ought to be another inducement
to the fall-abroad equestrienne to take more interest in
tier riding. One of his most successful pupils rode at a
metropolitan show, the other day, and a certain auri-
comous-iocked horse-reporter, whom most people know,
proposed to her on the very tan-track ! The wedding is
next month or thereabouts.
A good story (I have seen it in print before) is told of
the prospective bridegroom aforesaid, who is really one of
the most truly polite men in the world. Walking to the
office one evening he overtook a stout old lady staggering
beneath the weight of a big basket of clothes. “ Heavy
basket, mother,” said the horse-reporter—“ let me give
you a lift.” She gratefully assented, and he held up one
handle of the basket for fully half a mile. Next morning
he found that the clothes-line on his premises had been
“snow-dropped.” lie had actually (such is the reward
of benevolence !) helped to steal his own clothes!
I was sorry to miss the “ August dance ” held at Need’s
rooms, on 4th inst., because the hon. sec. (Dr. Mailler
Kendall) had things arranged like an inspiration, and
all enjoyed themselves immensely. And talking hop
reminds me that one or two festive Johnnies perpe-
trated rather a cruel jest at a party given the other even-
ing by a gilded hut miserly Somebody with an exceedingly
cheap cellar. They pencilled down the real price of the
vintage on the bottle-labels, and none of them went above
eighteenpence per imperial quart! Let us hope the lesson
was a salutary one.
Free and easy men tell very funny anecdotes of semi-
civilised papas (who are always shadowed and pacified by
a daughter) turning the gas off at Cinderella hours when
they think there’s been enough of it. The latest storyette
relates to a wealthy Southern tradesman who gave a
dance and threw his stuccoed villa open to the foe, but
openly objected to the lawns and verandahs being utilised
by the palpitating throng. “ Ain’t my ’ouse good enough
foryer?” he said indignantly shooing the couples in off
the balcony.
The meanest men are sometimes the very rich men who
often keep their “menageries” at starvation point.
There is such an economist in a Southern city, who en-
joys a nett income of at least £50,000 per annum, and
who, nevertheless, goes on the domestic warpath if
“mania” lets the younkers have sponge-cake.
To circumvent him, “ma” hit on the simple plan of
ordering the cake and having it booked as “ bread,” .and
all went merrily until the other day when she changed
her baker and suggested the old expedient to the new
man. But he struck an attitude and wouldn’t counten-
ance “no such goings on.” And the moral is that, after
going half-way in a court-case, he lost a customer.
The question that is agitating society in a Southern
city, just now, is, where did that hounding male warbler
get to for half-an-hour on the night they wanted him for
a banquet at a palatial “pub?” He begged to have thirty
minutes “ to show at a ball,” but never appeared there>
though he came back faithfully to the feed when the time
was up. Now everybody is dying to know where that
half-hour was spent. Was it a lady ? And has the ice
melted at last ?
By the way, I see that a love-lorn maiden has blushingly
enquired of The Bulletin if Mr. Charles Ryley, of
operatic fame, is a benedict or a bachelor. That fair en-
quirer is not the only one interested in this question. The
Byronic baritone, by the way, is very vocal in private—
doesn’t stand on his dignity at all, but warbles ballad
after ballad of the mawkish variety without waiting to
be pressed very hard.
One thing that Women’s Rights’ heroines might
advocate is that no girl shall go about possessed of
the economical notion that the male portion of the human
race ought to be eternally “standing Sam.” The average
wage-earning man is a precarious individual who hasn’t
got to send his salary along in a wheelbarrow, as a general
thing, and if he is blessed with a large circle of lady
friends and treats them as they expect to be treated he
ends a brilliant career with quill-pen marks on his cloth-
ing and a close clip and a clean shave as a general thing.
If women want to be really independent of men let them
manfully begin by paying their own way whenever they
can, and not by allowing every wretched hobbledehoy to
fritter his little screw in flowers and afternoon teas—just
because he happens to wear breeches.
Women are ever so much more “ thrifty ” than men—
they’re mean, to put it bluntly—as the over-driven cab-
horse and the imposed-upon masher may rise and sadly
testify some day. Even if a woman’s purse is bulging she
will let a skinny bank-clerk pay for her flowers and her ’bus-
fare, and simply reward him with a radiant smile which
may, of course, sweeten his subsequent saveloy. And to
pay her own cab-hire if she has driven ten miles and a
male friend happens to help her out at the end of them
is the sort of thing no woman ever expects to do.
The masterly manner in which woman keeps her fist
shut is never more beautifully exemplified than when she
is mashed on an actor-man. When a mere male begins to
feel like dying for a dame du theatre he starts ruining
himself with buggy-hire, bouquets, champagne, and
jewellery—but the stage-hero who has got a flower has no
trimmings on his conquest, poor fellow. Women (I am
told by an excellent authority who could paper all the
dressing-rooms in Australia with pink notes if he liked)
generally arrange matters to their own profit.
Assume the acquaintance made. The first form her
devotion takes is to extract a couple of free-passes for
herself and friend, for which perhaps she rewards him
with a flower for his coat. At the second interview she
begs for his photo. If he says he hasn’t one, then she
asks him to take one out of some photographer’s street
show-frame ! I feel sure he jibs at that. From what I
know of lime-light heroes, it would need a goddess—pure
and simple—to get him to remove the presentment of his
fatal beauty off the block beat.
Quite a little French comedy was enacted the other day
at the offlc.es of a dashing Sydney legal man who hap-
pened to be platonically entertaining a charming society
patron with tea and conversation when his mother’s voice
was heard outside. A convenient door in his room leading
through to the office of a chum, the lady beat a hurried
retreat thereby, but scarcely had she got through when a
gruff voice outside the chum’s door announced that a
stern father was on his track ! Which really is the reason
why it all leaked out.
Sydney Dual Swimming Club made the little fishes
green with envy at the Natatorium, Pitt-sf reet, the other
Wednesday, when its members (of both sexes) evoluted in
a large tank for the edification of a crowded gallery.
Aphrodite appeared in sack-shaped blue garment
with short sleeves and knickers and a scoop neck—after
all, only a trifle more revelatory than ordinary decollete !
The committee stated their intention, should the public
show symptoms of being able to endure the sight of mixed
bathing, to fence in a bit of the Beautiful Harbour where
you and I and all of us can fill our ears with salt-water
in company—and as the crowd calmly saw the perform-
ance out I suppose the Harbour baths are as good as
there. However, the fact that every second male bather
was bald makes me hesitate ere certifying to the pristine
innocence of the dual idea.
But let me earnestly recommend the fair members of
the Dual Swimming Club to take more heed of their per-
sonal appearance. Venus herself rising from the foam in
a blue jersey hanging round her bare ribs would have a
poor chance beside a properly-corseted woman. Not one
of the dual ladies wore whalebone: they all came forth
slab-sided and unnatural—l mean too natural. They
looked like children as they poised on the spring-board
or came headlong down the shoot. What a belle of the
bath one pretty little brunette, who swam like a herring,
would have been had she only fitted herself into something
a little less like a potato-sack !
The dear neighbours of a Sydney medical man were hor-
ribly scandalised the other day when he returned home in
a hurry and began deliberately divesting himself of the
husk of civilisation in the full glare of his back-garden.
But the innocent fact was that he had just “smelt small-
pox” in Somebody’s dwelling, and his wife wouldn’t let
him in till he had changed his clothes.
Women’s Suffrage must be getting on like a house
a-fire, judging by the frequency with which you meet the
house-father taking the olive-branches out for exercise
now-a-days. The other morning I met a happy papa (one
puts it that way from force of habit) out on his bicycle
with “ baby” slung in front in a wicker basket! Women’s
Rights can’t teach his wife much about the management
of Man, I’ll bet.
It is well-authenticated that one of the daughters of an
Australian big-gun, who was engaged (the daughter, not
the gun) to the dashing scion of a wealthy man, broke off
the engagement because Hie aforesaid scion couldn’t
satisfactorily explain why he was haunted by a confiden
lady with marigold hair. The legend goes that the
beauteous creature came and took his arm and called him
her darling, when he was strolling with his new angel
down—l forget the name of the street.
Judged by the light ot other days, the revival of
“Dorothy” at Her Majesty’s was but a dismal waste
with an occasional oasis in the shape of Violet Varley
(who’s going to be married, so perhaps that’s why her
song, “The time has come,” was one of the gems of the
ballad opera on the second night), who looked very sweet
in the blue-and-brown gown of the first act, and baritone
Ryley-, principally arrayed in an oyster-coloured satin suit
trimmed with silver. Mr. R.’s rendering of “Queen of
my Heart” (it’s a pet warble of his, by the way)
was positive cruelty to the worshipping d.o. maidens,
and I fully expected half-a-dozen of ’em to dive on to the
stage when the Ryley turned his eyes up and plaintively
enquired what they were waiting for.
As Dorothy, Clara Merivale re-appeared in a sudden
manner on the local operatic stage, which was probably
the reason why she was out of breath most of the time.
Also, she wore a butter-coloured train, seemingly “un-
broken to follow at the heel,” as the doggy men say, and
she showed too much ankle when she sat down. Miss
Young, as Lydia, wore nothing one might worry one’s
stationery about, and the stage-peasants were clean as
usual, and very happy.
The audience was large on the second evening. Mrs.
Van Greene, all in white feather boa, was pleasantly
visible, and a grey and pink woman had evidently gone to
a roseila parrot for inspiration.
East Sydney Rowing Club hold their annual ball at

The libel trouble between the Australian
Workman (Sydney) and Mr. Nelson P. White-
looke, editor of the National Advocate
(Bathrfrst, N.S.W.) has been settled per medium
of an apology tendered by the Workman directors
to Mr. Whitelooke.
Minister Suffer (N.S. W.) will consider the
Sydney Labour Town scheme when the Cabinet
has digested the report of their special commis-
sioner on the Maoriland Village Settlements. The
Bulletin trusts that the basis of any Government
action will be to absolutely preserve the leasehold
system with, say, 25 years’ valuation for rentals.
We are requested to say that the pamphlet on
Labour Town, by Frederic Jones, which deals
entirely with the residential aspect for artizans
occupied within the Sydney area, can be obtained
post free on application to its author.
Dear Bulletin,— l see that N.S.W.
Minister for Justice O’Connor proposes to effect
a yearly saving of a few thousands by abolishing
coroners’ juries and instituting a system of magis-
terial enquiries, similar to the Queensland vogue.
The enquiries are sometimes held in camera, in
which case no one ever becomes acquainted with
the evidence save minor officials and “ the law
officers of the Crown.” When an involved person
happens to be influential with the Government of
the day, and the case in wbich he is suspected of
being concerned is heard secretly, with the result
that no action is taken by “the Crown,”
suspicions of favouritism are natural. Magis-
terial enquiries should be sufficient for all purposes
of justice, but they should always be held in open
court, and the evidence should be at the disposal
of the press.—E. B.
As we write, the Broken Hill police-court
case, arising out of the assault committed with a
heavy ebony office-ruler by bank-manager Cotton
on miners’ delegate Sleatb, is still pending. How-
ever the police-coui’t case may end, little kudos
can attach to Cotton, a skilled boxer, and a well-
set-up man with a ring-trained temper, in using a
murderous weapon on the skull of a man who he
says insulted—he does not say assaulted —him.
Those who know how cool and businesslike a man
Sleath has consistently proved himself to be in
public and in private, are by no means inclined to
unreservedly swallow Cotton’s version of the cir-
cumstances which led to the fracas. As The
Bulletin has frequently had occasion to point
out, Sydney Echo, which exists to say for the
S.M. Herald all the mean and cowardly things
that the S.M. Herald dare not say for itself,
exultingly and suggestively alludes to "the assault
on Sleath as “ first blood at Broken Hill.” It is
rather a pity, by the way, that this grave assault
(which could surely never have occurred but for the
deadly class-hatred simmering in the breast of
one or other of the parties) is to be adjudicated
upon by Mr. Whippingdale Johnson, who abruptly
refused bail of any kind in the case of the unionist
picket arrested the other day at Broken Hill, and
at once granted light bail to a banker, in relation
to what was prima-facie a most serious offence.
Hon. Richard Chaffey Baker, M.L.C.,
C.M.G., prominent man in the “National
Defence League,” of Adelaide (S.A.), and with
-land and moneyed interests in various parts of
Australia, apparently is a polyhedral patriot,
who combines in his own personality several
blends of bogus Providence and real .Satan.
Chaffey Baker, C.M.C., the other day semi-
paralysed his brother property-owners by
tabling in the S.A. Legislative Council a “Con-
ciliation and Co-operation Act,” the assumption
being that Baker had suddenly conceived a
yearning for the down-trodden working man,
and that he might any day be expected to
don the red-cap of Communism and divide
his wealth among the unemployed. But,
alas ! Chaffey Baker contemporaneously
burst out into a violent public quarrel
with the Sydney directors of the Central
Broken Hill Silver Mining Co., an indis-
creet and impulsive act which has spilt
all the angelic grease into the fire. For when
the Adelaide and Melbourne boards of the
Central Mine essayed to wipe out the Sydney
directorate, because of the latter’s alleged mis-
management ami failure at dividend-getting,
the assailants were met with recriminatory
explanations, in the course of which it tran-
spired (amongst a variety of other things which
need not be here alluded to) that at the very
time when Baker, C.M.C., had an emancipating
Conciliation Bill gestating in his humane and
sympathetic brain, the following bloodthirsty
advice had been wired to the Sydney directors
with his signature attached
Local Board recommend, urge Sydney Government
arrest (Broken Hill) ringleaders to-night; immediately
deport overland to Sydney ; outrages would cease at
once.
“Fire low and lay ’em out!” The Central
Broken Hill directors, by meanly divulging a
private and confidential telegram illustrative of
the RR-conciliatory aspect of the Bakerian
(C.M.C.) character have placed the public
under a heavy obligation. And how Baker does
squirm !

Although “ Dorothy ” is, neither from
literary nor a musical point of view at nlu a
compared with any of the works of ’Gilho -e “ e
Sullivan, it has before now proved a trnm anr *
in the managerial hand. That the opera ha'T d
none of its powers of attraction was shown h! u St
packed attendance at Sydney Her Maiestv the
Saturday evening, which was perhap^C V*
of a season that has already been a nh P nms
success. The cast, though strong, is not so
as some previous ones. Clara Merivale who m°j
her first appearance this season, was the b m !li 6
and although she showed vivacity in her a c°K y ’
her singing of the part was not so satisfaS”
her voice being weak throughout. Flor™
Young, as Lydia, was in splendid form-Wc a
doubt bore off the musical honours of the even ?' 1
while little Violet Yarley embraced h er ;
opportunity, viz., the solo in the last act tn
which she was loudly encored. Miss Jv
Cameron was amusing as Mrs. Privett, especbll'!
in her business with Lurcher. Of Henrv r„„”
Charles Ryley and Howard Vernon, it need S
be said that they played their old parts in their
old way. The inevitable encore followed that
most clumsily interpolated ballad, “Queen of mv
Heart,” which Ryley sang with even more thin
his accustomed fervour. Lurcher is a character
so closely identified with Billy Elton, that anv
comedian coming after him is terribly handicapped
Comparison under the circumstances was inevi'
table, and George Lauri, clever actor as he has
shown himself, suffered in consequence. Not-
withstanding this, he succeeded in pleasing if
not entirely satisfying, the audience, and ’his
acting in the second act was decidedly funny
although he does not elaborate his effects as did
his predecessor. The opera, which is to run nine
nights, was splendidly staged, and the Royal
Ballerinas enlivened the proceedings with two
new ballets.

The Spanish Students continue to toot
many strange, sweet, weird melodies upon quaint
and bewildering instruments at Sydney Garrick
and to conduct themselves in a curiously irrespon-
sible manner on wild-looking machines that
open and shut in all sorts of unexpected places,
while the talented conductor mashes the musing
fly with his baton, and the violinist extracts soft,
joyous strains from the vitals of the cat. Their
season ends on Friday night, and on Saturday
John F. Sheridan returns once more for a final,
last, ultimate, conclusive farewell, which will not
be repeated under any possible circumstances
whatsoever, as Mr. Sheridan isn’t coining back to
farewell any more at present, neither will he be
re-engaged at enormous expense to appear for
another three nights only. On this occasion he
will sink the Widow O’Brien, that lady being
already packed up ready for exportation, and
appear for seven nights only in “The
Shaughraun,” which Irish drama he recently pro-
duced with great success at Melbourne Royal.
After that, Mr. Sheridan departs to America for
an indefinite period. Some eulogistic remarks
about Mr. Fred. Hiscooks’ benefit at the same
theatre are unavoidably held over till next issue.

Miss Myra Kemble took possession of
Sydney Opera House on Saturday night, and
started manfully to resurrect its fallen for-
tunes. Her purpose is evidently to make the
Opera House fill the place formerly occupied by
the Criterion as the home of comedy in Sydney,
and she deserves to succeed. The establishment,
now that it has been re-constructed, is—apart
from the oft-cursed staircase—as comfortable as
the favourite institution in Pitt-street, and the
company is little less capable than the old B. andß.
combination, and the only thing to which the most
fastidious can take much objection is the painted
female on the drop-scene—the one who sits on the
clouds, and has an angular iron tank hidden under
her flowing robes, as is evidenced by the corners
sticking out. “Jane ” was the first production of
Miss Kemble’s season, and it was played to a
continuous ripple of laughter. There is a whole
lot of moral in “Jane,” but no one seems to know
whether the authors knew it or not. It demon-
strates, in the first place, that the slavey who
wants to rise in the world must grasp the tail of
opportunity by the forelock, and hug her em-
ployer at the right moment. It shows, further,
that the flunkey who is trodden upon too heavily
will turn at last, and that the drunk and desperate
menial with his collar burst and his feelings
lacerated is a dangerous thing to handle; and it
also proves that an enormously fat woman robbed
of her infant is worse than the famished lion whieh
pursues the juicy missionary in the wilderness.
Also, in between these other teachings, it em-
bodies a melancholy warning to fish-liars, and
snake-liars, and all other perverters, and evinces
conclusively that people of deficient intelligent
had better adhere to the truth ; and it also shows
that it is an agreeable billet to be a fat, bal .
bloated trustee, because the situation affoids
facilities for embracing your ward’s wife wine
are not to be despised. There is a lot more pin-
found moral in “Jane,” but the rest of it 15
crowded out.

Concerning Myra Kemble it is only need-
ful to say that she makes Jane an ideal
kissable slavey, the most attractive housenm
who ever threw the cat out to freeze on a win J.
night, and ran amok among the dishes m .

tracted minion in single harness upon reCO '

sticking up like wrings on each side of the

to no strong objection. But the most S &v

Messrs. B. & 8., who never weary of well-
doing everything they have to do, staged a pleas-
ing pair °1 novelties at Melbourne Bijou on
Saturday. The first item was a one-act sentimental
comedy by Haddon Chambers, called “ The Open
Gate ” showing how the patience of a mature
spinster is rewarded by the return of a lover she
had permitted to escape her in the days of her
youth. For a-quarter of a century or so this fair
penitent leaves her garden-gate open on the off-
chance of dear Johnny coming back along the
narrow rustic path which leadeth to her affections,
and at last a certain strange something in the
lady’s chastened heart tells her that John has
turned up. Her presentiment is quite correct.
John appears upon the premises, and the good old
gate shuts him in of its own accord, whereupon he
feels that further resistance would be useless, and
his grey-haired girl annexes him without a
struggle. It is a simple, hackneyed story of
theatre life, told in well-chosen, hackneyed terms,
and apparently founded on “Sweethearts.” A
nephew and niece supply a little subordinate love
interest, and the whole is prettily played by the
Broughs, Cecil Ward, and Miss Brenda Gibson,
the latter being especially winsome.
• « •
Coming after the calm, pastoral narrative
aforementioned, “The Grey Mare” seems wild
and frisky. The hero of this occasion is an
amateur liar with no natural qualifications for the
business. In a weak moment he determines to
tell one lie as a specimen of his ability to break a
Law of Moses if he wanted to, and the result is a
miserable fiction concerning a ride on a grey mare
which recoils upon his dull head and wrecks his
happiness for two hours. In many respects the
doctor who didn’t go for a ride reminds one of
“ The Solicitor ” who tore around on a hansom
cab. His sin finds him out with similar ingenuity,
and the troubles that arise from the mare justify
a dim suspicion that she was originally attached
to the cab in question. Sims and Raleigh
have produced a robust farce between them
but so many things happen before the suffering
liar has worked his salvation that the house is
rather weary of surprises when the curtain falls.
Titheradge acts the martyr in his usual finished
style. Brough is very useful in a good comedy
part, and Mrs. Brough is another prominent
feature of the joke. Also, Miss Temple, as a
married lady in search of suspicious circumstances,
represents that eternal type of humanity with
terrible realism, whilst Messrs. Cannam, Bouci-
cault, Fabert, and Ward fill in the small parts
and assist to glorify the ensemble.
** * *
At the Princess’s, they are still playing
“ In the Ranks ” and arresting George Rignold
on suspicion at the gates of the tabernacle. Few
actors have had more experience in sorrow and
unjust persecution than poor George, and his
manner, as the h%ro of this sad drama, denotes a
general state of pteparedness for anything painful
that likes to transpire. He has become inured to
misery. There’s a pessimistic ring in his, rich
voice, and he carries his head a trifle on one side
as though in readiness for the next calamity to
fall upon him. Miss Watts-Phillips is likewise
subject to a sense of impending evil, but the boss
villain, on the other hand, is a rather cheerful
person, who seems to have got into his billet by
mistake. Another week will bring Rignold’s
season to a close, and a change of bill is likely to
occur on or before Saturday.
** » *
Meanwhile the Gaiety crowd at Melbourne
Opera House promise to go out more gloriously
than they came in, a few months ago. “ Carmen
up to Data ” is a better-written burlesque than
“Faust” or “Joan of Arc,” and the two prin-
cipal men seem to rejoice in the knowledge that
they have some cards to play, instead of being
obliged to bluff the audience on poor hands.
Lonnen’s humour is best suited to the young,
perhaps, and his face has but a small assortment
of moods at command, but he grows vastly more
volatile and happy as time goes on. Courtneidge
has improved on his first performance (in
“Faust”) even more decidedly than the lead-
ing man, and if the season were to last
another six months a change for the better might
come over some of the other people, and possibly
the six foot girl with the unbreakable smile would
launch out into song, or do something tangible.
However, as they all leave for Sydney, by special
train, next week, the long fairy in question is not
likely to effect such a surprise. Till then th 0
Opera House is bound to boom, for the entertain-
ment has nothing of its class to contend against
and is well-suited to a damaged community. Men
who have scarcely a leg left to stand upon find a
melancholy satisfaction in going where so many
pairs of extremities are thrown about.
** m *
Next Wednesday (Aug. 17th) Lonnen is
to have a benefit matinee of an extra-special
character, the bill comprising “Carmen up to
Data,” with bits: rom other burlesques thrown in
to increase the incoherency and general effect.
The advt. speaks familiarly of Lonnen as
“Teddy,” which shows that the personal dignity
of an actor is a mere matter of business, so to
speak. If Rignold were to break out as a “ Bogie
Man ” it would be permissible to call him
“ Jargey,”

There was a very fair benefit attendance
at Melbourne Royal on Saturday, when Frank
Cates, at the head of a band of amateurs, made a
murderous attack upon the Immortal Bard. The
Bard had his brains knocked out, but his assailants
are still at large. A story is extant, written in
choice Australian, to the effect that Cates once
played Hamlet “ beautifully” in London, in which
case his conception of the character can’t have
worn well. Oates looked beautiful enough, but in
all other respects, his Hamlet was a meaning-
less young man. He talked the lines, with
only an occasional touch of sympathy, and
acted without any apparent suggestion of any
kind of emotion. The effort of committing
his part to memory, and drilling his com-
pany into shape, had exhausted all his intelli-
gence on Saturday, perhaps. Miss Bronton was
the Queen, and a Miss Aimee Moore managed to
put tears and trouble into the voice of Ophelia,
although there was nothing of the born actress in
the rest of her performance.

Musin’s three concerts at the Town Hall
made more reputation than money for that gifted
violinist, but business was sufficiently big to
justify a hope that he will appear again in Mel-
bourne anon. His is just the sort of show in which
the Much-Travelled would revel. The Cogill’s
have a capital show just now at St. George’s
Hall, and a few other places are doing about as
well, or indifferently, as usual.
At Poverty Point.
A splenetic theatrical critic in an important town in one
of the Australias lately wrote down a “first night” by
meanly attacking several of the lady artistes on the score
of age and false-teeth. The afternoon of the day of publi-
cation witnessed a street-full of people listening, with
visible perturbation, to the hysterical sobs of the prima
donna assoluta , as the liquid notes of grief floated, like
the love-sick notes of an abandoned curlew, from an
upper-storey window of a'leading hotel. The ruthless
scoundrel who fiendishly alludes to feminine age hits
lovely woman below the zone-strap.
A Melbourne man has been fined £lO for chawing
nigger-minstrel Frank Clark’s ear off. He must have been
hungry ! Let us hope it wasn’t Clark’s ear for music that
got damaged.
A private letter from London announces the fact that
Nellie Somebody won’t play any more under the direction
of—er—Somebody. Nellie is said to be very depressed in
spirits, and there is some talk of her leaving the stage
altogether and going back to her luvin’ husband, who
happens to be in London at present.
Williamson and Musgrove secured the lease of the
Sydney Lyceum two days before the Theatre Royal fire,
which was an extremely lucky bit of business for the new

Julius Knight, who was out here with Laura Villiers,
has been playing the part of Napoleon the First in a his-

Katie Barry, the smallest exponent of tights in the
Gaiety Cos., carried about the largest assortment of huge

Bernard Beere won’t play “ Fedora ” in London, because
Bancroft means to keep it up his sleeve till ’94. Neither
can she play it in America, because the Davenport, a frost
in the part, “houlds the flure.”
Fred. Storey is another Gaiety Companyion who finds
he can do more business elsewhere. He is booking music-
hall engagements for next year, and will make a first
appearance at London Alhambra on Boxing Night.
Madame Melba and “Kangaroo Charlie” Armstrong
have arranged their marital differences with a sensible
agreement to judicially separate. Melba has, it is stated,
been allowing Armstrong £IOOO a year.
Frank Cates can hardly dispute that his professional
merits have obtained fair recognition. Yet it must be
rather mortifying for him to turn over his old notices of
his London amateur Hamlet, when the Hornet wrote
that it was like flashes of lightning in summer. Beerbohm
Tree, writing to an Australian friend recently, mentioned
that he had picked out points of Cates’s Hamlet, to which
he acted a subordinate part.
Nellie Farren’s numerous admirers will hear with regret
that she will probably never again be seen on the stage.
She is very seriously ill, though in no immediate danger.
Cuttica-Signor, not Signora—whose voice is as un-
certain as an old maid’s temper, has occasionally sung in
wonderful form at Melbourne Exhibition concerts. The
plump little man was wont to get terribly throaty under
the strain of a heavy operatic part three times a week,
but as a warbler of a couple of solos, after six days’ rest,
he justifies all that was said of his voice before it landed
in Australia.
Melbourne and Adelaide having given their verdicts on
the three Gaiety pieces, it remains to be seen what Bris-
bane and Sydney have to say. The bright, sparkling
“ Carmen ” takes the cake in Melbourne, tut almost
failed in Adelaide. The romantic subject, lovely scenery,
and wonderful costumes give it an advantage, and it is
just up to the Melbourne intellect.
Lennox Browne (“Larynx” Browne jokists call him)
gives some of the smartest “at homes ”in London. You
can always calculate upon meeting at his house celebrities
in the musical, dramatic and artistic world, and the best
music is heard there. Mrs. Lennox Brown is an Austra-
lian—daughter of ah ex-Victorian M.P. Lennox himself
spent some time in Australia, with the usual advantage to
himself.
Elton, at latest dates, had accepted a not very promising
London engagement.
The Melbourne Sunday night concerts have come down
to three "sacred ” items in a long bill, but the Doxology
covers all the sins of the programme.
One Blascheck, a young Hebrew gentleman with a ton
of self-assurance and a game leg, has taken to reciting at
Melbourne theatrical benefits a piece of ghastly stupidity,
entitled “ The Cockney’s Seven Ages.” It is time he was
told not to do it again. With Blascheck as an amateur
comedian there is little fault to find. In fact, the young
man seems decidedly funny when he gets a chance, nut
he hasn’t sufficient sense of humour to understand that
“ The Cockney’s Seven Ages ” is unmitigated bosh.
The divine Sara has accepted a one-act play called
“ Salammbo,” written by Oscar Wilde in French. The
title sounds rather like a minstrel corner-man.

Question whether there will be a Christmas pantomime
at Melbourne Royal—a serious matter to a great crowd of
working people. Coppin said the last didn’t pay. The
Royal has only missed one pantomime, 1805, when Lyster
gave “ Oberon.”
Cecchi has hung on longer than almost anyone else as a

Melbournian ; In a long experience of the stage, I
have only seen Burford act once. It was the second time
I went to a theatre, Boxing Night, 1855, Melbourne Royal
Pantomime, by Tom Pavey, “Harlequin, King of the
Golden Island,” and ail I remember of the first piece,
termed “The Fratricide,” is Burford’s bushy brows.
Ibsen’s courtship : He wrote a proposal to the parson s
daughter, and said he would call at 5 p.m. to know.
They kept him waiting two hours, and he was savaged,
till the girl crawled out from under the sofa, saying she
only meant to try his patience.
A Masonic service at Melbourne Town Hall, the other
Sunday, was notable for the beautiful solos of Horace
Stevens, the youth who sang a small part in oratorio with
Madame Patey a while back. Amongst hundreds of boy
choristers trained during the past 10 years by Charles
Truelove, the musical conductor on this occasion, young
Stevens is one of the best. Moreover, his voice promises
to train on into maturity.
Since the organ recitals at Melbourne Town Hall have
been given free of charge, big audiences turn up every
time. All Collins-street seems to be there, and the
audience pound with their large, spreading feet for an
encore at every number, as if they were paying half-a-
crown.
The Maflezzoli orchestral concerts, Melbourne, have
failed completely, and are knocked on the head.
Melbourne Theatre Royal closed, and Opera House

Musgrove holds the Australian rights for “Caval-

Alec. Mayne, Brough and Boucicault’s manager, who
comes out of his shell reciting at matinees, can act very

Lonnen scarcely makes up his face at all in “ Carmen,”

Said Billy Emerson to the writer: “ My idea of happi-
ness is to stick in one place, like you, but I’ve been on

Little Evelyn Hughes, an infant phenomenon, is said to
imitate Chevalier, in his “coster” songs, more effectively

Dear Bulletin, —The Barrier Ranges Mining
Association figures out that the total expenditure pf the
Barrier mines has been (omitting the odd thousands)
£7,000,000; the total dividends, £4,700,000, that there-
fore, so far, capital is out of pocket £2,300,000! This is
the.queerest balance-sheet ever yet published, lias not
the bulk of the £7,000,000 expenditure been taken out of
the ground? If you put £lOOO of your capital into a
claim.at the start, lake out £lO,OOO worth of gold and pay
£7OOO for wages and additional machinery, your total
expenses have been £BOOO, your profit has been £BOOO,
and therefore, according lo the 8.M.A., you are out o(
pocket £5OOO ! It is too thin. Capital’s case must be in
a bad way if such a piece of mathematics has to be
brought into the field. Even Mr. Hancock, in his letter
to the daily press, does not hit the right track. Get the
total amount of calls paid in cash o'n Broken Hill shares,
compare this with the total amount of dividends and you
will see to what extent Capital is in or out,of pocket. Or
get the total amount of money received for sale of silver
and lead and compare with this the total expenditure and
you ought to get pretty well the same figure.—Yours, C.
* # *
Editor Bulletin,—l notice that you have
quoted from my letter to Sydney D.T., of July 20, about
those —let me mildly say misleading—reports of the
Broken Hill Proprietary Mine, and I am glad to read your
comments on the same. Is it not monstrous to issue
such reports as that of July, 1890, when the deluded
shareholders were induced to buy at £l3 on the strength
of such glowing prospects? But, what do you think of
the action of the mine authorities in cabling to London,
on 2nd June last, the following (vide London Mining
Journal, 25/6/’92): “Shares £4 15s. 6d. There is no
reason known for the decline. The mine is looking in
every way as well as ever. Possibly cause of decline is
on account of company having decided to insist on ore
sloped to be executed by contract.” And that at a time
when the last half-yearly report had already been printed
showing the utter breakdown of the mine ! I will give
you some more facts to work out. Last half-year the
average of silver from the Proprietary was 32 oz., which,
including the lead produced, realized about 4s. 2d. per
oz. The net profit per ton of ore was £2 17s. lOd. Now,
Manager Howell admits that it is impossible to keep up
this average, and I fancy the yield can’t be more than
25 oz. for the ensuing year. Then we have 25 oz. at
3s. lid. (inclusive of lead, and the price of silver reduced
by 3d.), gross value, £4 17s. lid. ; expenses, £3 10s. (last
half-year, £3l4s. Id).; nett per ton, £l7s. lid., which would
hardly suffice to pay a shilling div. per month. And
who will, after this, believe in any official mining reports?—
Disgusted.
# * *
The Bulletin predicted as much. A secret
inspection of the big Broken Hill mine shows the timbers
to be smashed and smashing in all directions and the
shafts giving way. Months before the strike it required
an army of timber-men to keep the mine open, hence the
present havoc. If the mine remains “perfectly safe,”
why is inspection prohibited? It won’t lie long ere the
real reason of the strike and the motive which accelerated
it will be clear to all men. Strike or no strike^ American
management is doomed, open square-set timbering will be
abandoned, and “ busted ” shareholders will remain to
curse the day it was introduced. When the mine has
practically collapsed, well-known Australian managers
whose warnings have been unheeded in the glare of
dividends will be called upon to set it right—a costly and
tedious job. The gigantic blunder made in the working
of the mine will never be repeated in Australia.
# # *
Not long ago a British Co. in the Far North-
West by South, a little East, got into the usual trouble
that befalls British companies with London directorates
operating in Australia. The shareholders refused to sub-
scribe any more money for at least a year, and their swell
manajah was instructed to use every endeavour to make
the concern “self-supporting” during the interval.
So the hands were all “ sacked ” except the
English element, which consisted of the boss, the
accountant, three or four under-clerks and a mining
jackeroo or two, and a groom and a housekeeper
who ministered to them. There was no money to pay
the common men, who were put off. Next day the
groom was despatched to town, 12 miles away, and in-
structed to run the Co.’s credit for all it vvas worth in
cigars and whisky and all else needed to tide its officers
over the “self-supporting” period. The idea proved
successful. So did the move of providing for their future
salaries. At the end of every month the groom was
despatched with the dray laden with whatever was
marketable from about the mine. In this way went
a lot of wire-rope and quicksilver as well as a kit of
blacksmith’s tools, specially selected in England. Mean-
time the staff were out on a “ howling tear,” and only
sobered a little now and then when the unpaid miners
swooped down infuriate and besieged the quarters and
hurled huge rocks upon the iron roof. After a while the
news got about among the independent population of the
neighbourhood that the concern was undergoing a process
of free-and-easy liquor-dation. Whereupon the large-
hearted residents began to manifest great interest in the
deserted mine, also to surreptitiously shift the balance of
the fast-disappearing removables. Then the Co.’s repre-
sentatives held a forced sale of the remaining portable
effects and settled down for another orgy, which carried
them over the remaining time. When the funds arrived
at length and work was about to be resumed it was dis-
covered that a most determined attempt had been made
by some of the large-hearted public to remove the big
boiler by loosening it with crowbars at night with a view
to rolling it down the hill-side.

Broken Hill Sleath took to Melbourne a large
photograph (by Jenkinson, of the Barrier) of the creep at
M’Gregor’s shaft, showing a fissure some 14ft. wide.
Leading shareholders, before whom Sleath placed this
irrefragable proof, all replied; “The directors and Mr.
Howell say there’s no creep, and we don’t want to see any
photograph. Take it away, if you please.”
* * #
Another big effort is being made to change the
place of management of the Broken Hill Central. In the
midst of the last attempt a big deputation waited upon
the N.S.W. Colonial-Treasurer to ask that all N.S.W
Mining Co.’s should be compelled to register in the pro-
vince. Now, another deputation has renewed the request
—the same crowd impelled by the same circumstances.
The motive is more spiteful than genuine, although the
object is right. “ A dissatisfied Sydney shareholder ” re-
commends the change on the ground of the obvious in-
consistency of the official assurances of the good financial
position of the Co. when contrasted with immediately-
following results. The transitions of the Central are
simply disgusting, and, not to speak in conundrums—the
knowing ones have got out.

The agents of the Luhrig and Frue Vanner
concentrators continue to challenge each other for £lOOO
without coming to the scratch. We say again the con-
ditions of concentration are so variable that they will
probably never meet; if they do there will be ten times
more wrangling after the match than before it. Each is
no doubt better than the other under favouring con-
ditions.

Mount Gahan, Pambula. It is reported that
“ the main shaft is down 260 ft. following the underlie of

public would like to know is never published. It is simply
—what is the value of the lode below the 100 ft. level?

The watchword of Property—“ Some men

Shearer W. G. Spence is a parliamentary
candidate for Dundas, Vic. Melbourne Argus
warns its crowd that he would be “mischievous”
inside the House.
Freetrade Melbourne Argus says that
Victoria has passed through the crisis of her

Since S. A. was founded, despite the large
preponderance of German colonists, Messrs.

Queensland Legislative Council let the
Griffilwraith Land Grant Railway job through
without a murmur. The mover moved and the
seconder seconded, and the thing was done.
The Bananaland mining members who
support the Griffilwraith creation of mineral
monopolies are “Facing-both-ways Mellor, Mess-
of-pottage Hodgkinson, and Next-for-oliice Rut-
ledge. ”
Ex-Premier Playford’s friends, in view of
the shakiness of his present seat and the proba-
bility of his being displaced by a labour-candidate,
want him to stand for S.A. Legislative Council
next year.
Mr. Henry Hoyle, the N.S.W. Labour-
member who “comes from one of the best families
in England,” does not believe in “Domain
howlers.” The man who can’t hire a hall to spout
in is not according to Hoyle.
N.S.W. Minister for Works Lyne :
“ Every article I require in carrying out Govern-
ment contracts, if it can be manufactured in this
province it shall be, even if it costs 15 or 20 per
cent, more than the imported article.”
“ Representative Government is really
rule by a succession of quasi-oligarchies of politi-
cal rings, indirectly and remotely responsible to
the majority. A democracy can only rule, in
reality, by direct legislation.”— J. W. Sullivan.
“ When I have seen the small share that
has been allowed as the product of labour, and the
large share taken by those who did not work, I
have felt the touch of madness in my brain,” once
said the late Rev. Hugh Gilmore, of Adelaide.
£ £ Smith, in the Victorian House on the
Totalisator Bill: —“ As chairman of the Victorian
Club I cannot vote for the Bill.” This after speak-
ing in favour of the measure. With £ £ the
country thus comes second to the Victorian Club.
“ The working-classes should share in the
inconveniences caused to the employers of labour
by the incidence of a period of commercial depres-
sion.” Yes, so they will when landlords permit
them to participate in the advantages of periods
of prosperity.
At last ! William Smyth, M.L.A. for
Gympie, has rounded on the Griffilwraith Govern-
ment:—“There is no worse Government than a
Coalition Government. The Opposition are
actually more in favour of the Government than
anybody else.”
Only about twenty Labour candidates put
up at the late British general election. And yet
they call it a democratic monarchy. Granted the
amendment of the franchise, and 100 tweed-capped
Labour members will take seats at Westminster
after next election.
Mr. Smith Fish, M.H.R. (Maorilaud),
denounces womanhood suffrage as a “filthy
thing,” and says he will do “ all that lies within
his own humble, miserable capacity ” to prevent
it. Fish’s capacity is pretty miserable, too, when
you know it as intimately as does the present
writer.
Symon, Q.C , the Purves of S.A. Bar, is
anxious to re-enter Parliament. His president-
ship of the Freetrade League cost him his seat
five years ago, but he is now understood to have
recanted. He tried hard, but unsuccessfully, to
get an Abolition of Oaths Bill through, and this
is still one of his ambitions.
G. H. Reid declares that KS.W. Legisla-
tive Council consists of “men of keen intellect,”
and who have proved their possession of keen
intellects by their success in life. G.H.R.
evidently worships the fatty degeneration called
ouccess by the drossolators.
The Kanakilgriff Government of Queens-
land proposes to give land-grant railway syndi-
cates absolute ownership of all the minerals
beneath the surface of the areas they receive in
payment for railway construction ! As well give
them the fee-simple of the air above.
During the last decade, six provinces of
the Eijian islands, under British Crown Colony
Government, have seen their native population
decrease from 51,770 in ’Bl to 40,570 in ’9l : a loss
of 8200, or nearly 15 per oenf.v—instead of the
average national increase of 25 per cent.
London Investors’ Review says that
Maoriland “would be unable to pay its way for a
week without further borrowing.” Considering
that Maoriland hasn’t borrowed anything for some
years and is slowly reducing its debt by means of
a sinking-fund, this is tolerably “ steep.”
Melbourne Trades Council petitions Govern-
ment that the tonnage limit now applied to
Chinese immigration shall apply to unnaturalised
and naturalised Mongols alike, in order to obviate
traffic in naturalisation papers and consequent
evasions of the Chinese Immigration Acts.
It has not yet, we think, been pointed out
that Chaffey Baker’s bogus Conciliation Bill, intro-
duced to S. A. Legislative Council, is worthless.
As a “money bill”—for it necessitates an appro-

tionally be originated in the Legislative Council.

“The stubborn opponents of reform are

But I am too old to see the next great revolution,

We read that Duffy, the Griffilwraith
candidate for Bundaberg, (Q.) was so confident of
success that he engaged a brass band, in advance,
to whale the mighty drum in honour of his election.
And when Labour candidate Hall was returned,
that recreant band went away and serenaded the
victor, and made Duffy pay the bill all the same.
Dear Bulletin, The N.S.W. Labour
Electoral League put Parkes out of power. The
old man is now displaying so much interest in the
N.S.W. Women’s Suffrage League that people
really begin to think he regards that body as a re-
actionary organisation bent on acting as an
antidote to the Labour Electoral League.—D.D.
East Macquarie (N.S.W.) election, this
Saturday, is worth watching. The candidates are
J. E. Tonkin, the late member, who had to resign
on account of insolvency, and John Boyd, jnnr.
Tonkin is an ex-publican, a mining stock-jobber,
a pupil of Parkes, a Foreign-trader, and, all
things considered, a rank Tory. Boyd is a work-
ing baker, of Bathurst, a native Australian, one
of the promoters of the Bathurst branch of the
Labour Electoral League, a unionist, and, up to
date, a sterling democrat. Despite the tremendous
capitalistic influences arrayed against him, he
will make a good fight, even if he does not win.
Adelaide Quiz :
Labour is indeed between the devil and the deep sea—
the deep sea bein'? starvation, and capital the other
thing. When the Broken Hill Unions appoint some able
man as an officer be straightway gets the sack, and has to
“walk the line of lode” looking in vain for work. Then
the capitalistic press calls him an “ agitator and a loafer,
who won’t work.”
Sydney workers are about to hold their
annual eight-hours’ demonstration. They might
far more fitly meet, not for junketing and rejoic-
ing, but to consider how to get rid of the awful
unemployed evil and to band themselves together,
in unbreakable bonds, to struggle for the political
power of which only internal dissensions have
deprived them.
Hoolan, M.L. A. (Queensland), claims to
know a respectable plural voter who made his
first “rise” by selling hisyoungand pretty wife to a
rich Chinaman for .£4OO. Then he speculated in
mining properties with the ,£4OO and made nearly
,£2OOO, and with this little pile he went land-
booming in Brisbane, and now he is an honoured
citizen with many allotments, and every allotment
votes for Griffith.
We guess at once the name of the poli-
tician who, in Sydney Evening News, is trying
to marshal the Yellow Pup against Toby Barton’s

with quotations and bogus quotations in Latin

Col. Howard Vincent on Dibbs: “A
Briton of great distinction, Australian-born, Aus-
tralian-bred, but none the less as much a
‘Britisher,’ as loyal a ‘ Britisher,’ as you and I.”
The Republican Dibbs, K.C.M.G., stood it all
and owned up to it all. In England, instead of
being ashamed of the Soudan goat and nonkey,
he travelled on them all the time.

Protection, so far from injuring our wool-trade, would
greatly assist it. The wool we produce is purchased
because it is the best in the world, and because it is
wanted. If it were not wanted, all the Freetrade in the
world would not find a market for it; as it is wanted, all
the Protection in the world cannot check its sale.
How averse horse-haired politicians are to
thepaymentof parliamentary representatives! The
assailant of the Tasmanian honorarium—a petty

lawyer, whose shyness with the fair sex has been a
household word in Tasmania since his salad days.

The representatives of the (bogus)
“National Defence League” in S.A. Assembly
have succeeded in mutilating the Land Values
Assessment Bill. For four years this measure has
been carried by large majorities, and was adopted
unanimously by the corporations and district
councils, but the land monopolists have this year
struck out the provisions as to district councils.
The deliberate way in which those directly in-
terested voted was simply shocking.
Sydney Sunday Times chumpily prophesies
that payment of members “will yet be the
absolute ruin of Australia,” i.c ., labour legislators
will effect the ruin of Australia, since they are the
only representatives to whom payment is an ab-
solute necessity. Shoddy upstarts would have the
working masses represented only by other equally
shoddy upstarts who have succeeded in acquiring
competencies by means of usury, robbery, 'fraud,
logrolling, or (at the best) sheer luck.

It is alleged that the Registrar-General of
an Australian province has been playing into
the hands of the local National Ass. The

elicit an official answer to the inquiry. It cer-

We sing of John Kiernan who got into trouble
For voting a couple of times,
When one of his class dares to poll himself double
His tricks are accounted as crimes ;
Yet a wealthy old bore calmly plumping for four
Escapes all suspicion of sin,
And a number of men use the strength, say, of ten
At getting Conservatives in.
Poor foolish John Kiernan is plainly a felon,
He voted a couple of times :
His thoughts for six months ought to certainly dwell on
The virtue of dollars and dimes,
As he puts in his “ hard” with the lags in the yard
And weeps for the cub of his coat.
Sure a man is inereas’t to a couple at least
By means of the property vote.

long be remembered in Auckland for his crusade
against Rugby football, which he considered toe

Minister Seddon (Maoriland), an ambi-
tious vocalist, recently made a steamer trip from
Waitara to Mokau, and favoured the passengers
with numerous songs. One Smith, M.H.R., said
to the skipper: “I suppose, captain, it’s along
time since you have had so much music on board
during a trip between Waitara and Mokau.”
“Not since I had the last cargo of pigs, sir,” said
the sea-dog. “Well,” said Seddon, “you’re an
uncouth customer. It would be a difficult matter
to find many of your sort in the country, I should
say.” “Oil no, there’s plenty on ’em— plenty.”
“Where?” “In the House of Representatives,

Bismarck lately said (as per cable) at Jena

Dear Bulletin. —Apropos your recent
yarn about Johnny Marin : —ln the early days of
Maoriland, Johnny acquired a section of the. then
desolate swamp that is now the heart of Welling-
ton city. Alongside his property was a larger and
better piece of swamp which nobody seemed to
own. After a few years’ watching and waiting,
Johnny fenced this in, and by and by received a
title from the original pirate-syndicate that came
on the grab from dear old England. Johnny
paid the taxes regularly and built a fine mansion
upon it, and the site, being in the centre of
the nascent city, became of considerable value.
About 19 years after Johnny had taken possession,
a vagrant old salt crossed the lawn and entered
the house, encountering Mrs. Marin, a volcanic
lady of puissant arm, who shook him up badly
until Johnny came along to see what was the
trouble. The tar couldn’t get a word in edgewise,
was summarily given in charge and sent to prison
for a brief term. When he had “ done his time,”
the shellback went to a lawyer and handed him a
document covered with Maori writing, and which
he declared had been given him years before by a
Maori chief in exchange for a bottle of rum, some
tobacco, and other coveted articles. This docu-
ment was a genuine title-deed to the site which
Johnny had “jumped” and on which he had
erected a grand mansion. The old sailor, however,
was not too exacting, but accepted an apology,
with <£3ooo (about half-value) to boot.—Yours,
etc,

“J.F.W.”: “Do we know of any publication showing
the benefits of our separating from the United Kingdom,
the price, and where procurable?” Yes, of course—The
Bulletin, price (id., comes out every week, is always on
the job, and can be got everywhere “Irish”: Kan-
garoo yarn respectfully but firmly declined “ T.G.C.” :
Haven’t yet published “Comp.” (Melb.): Looks too
much like a spiteful “turn.” Send something less
obviously malicious about somebody not so insignificant.
“Jack Shay”: Your version really doesn’t contra-
dict “ Hiram Abiff’s.”.. “Tasmanian Bushman”: You
mustn’t be too hard on the poor daily newspaper editor,
who is usually talked to death in the long run “ New-
castle”: The effects of drink .. “K.D.M.”: Hope to use
shortly “E.R.P.” : Thanks. . “ A.M.S.” (East Melb.):
We object to you hitting the world when it is down with
an MS. like that... “J.K.”: Can’t you write one demo-
cratic poem without the word “sweat” in it?...
“G.R.C.”: What kind of language is this?—
“ One day as I hollowly, hollowly dirged
At a song that was w'ailfully wail.”
You are related to that poet who lately wwote us about
the shimmer of summer and the ghoulful glamour of
g100m... “Old Glub”: Thanks “Wat Tyler”: Par-
able of (he bat and the cow is declined “A. G.

a valuable example of the lugubrious commonplace ...
“M. Parish”: Painful story, and borrowed bodily from
that gruesome, slush-sodden thing. “East Lynne.”
Make a drama of it and call it “ West Whine.” “F.
Tasellie” : (1) Sorry “ the suspense is killing you.” We
answered you in “correspondence” long ago. (2) The

we detest sea-stories in which the crew' play April-fool

injured.. “ Pallio ” ; Requires much hard consideration .
“ J.T.” : We don’t yearn for incidents of the Nile expedi-

«Ab the mansion of Lord Darmgton,” says the S. M. HehaEd<*>rrespondent* ‘‘the Prince o£ Wales and Hr. !Dibbs found *
few pleasant things to say to each other, chiefly about the colonies. The Prince is an exceedingly well-informed man, am
Premier was rather astonished at tho shrewd pointed questions put to him by the Heir-Apparent.”
HERE IS WHAT PASSED BETWEEN THEM.
(From our ov:n Correspondent.)
H. R H. ; “ Beautiful weather we are having now ?”
Dubs : “Charming ! Do you object to smoke?
H.R.H.: “ No, smoke away. Where there is so much fire there must
be some smoke. You are a fiery old cuss, I hear. Ha * ha I ha !
DIBBB ((ieferi.fitially): “Ha! ha! ha I’
H.R.H. : “By the bye, do you always smoke a pipe.?”
Dibbs : “ Invariably when I’m at home,”
H.R.H. : “ Well, you’re at Hume now !”
Dibbs; “I beg pardon. I meant when 1 am in New South Wales.
What’s your favourite smoke ?”
H.R.H. ; “’Backer-at ”
Dibbs : “ Backer at what ?”
H.R.H. ; “ Don’t you see? It’s a sort of play upon words. Baccarab
- Backer-a< /”
Dibbs (doubtfully ); “He!he! he !”
H.R.H. ; “Thank you, old man. You saw both my jokes. Here's a
12-inch cigar for you. Smoke it on your way home—l mean Australia.
Here you have the Prince and Sir George saying
i pleasant things to each other.
And here you see Sir George boldly
tackling the Prince’s cigar. .
“ The fact is," said the Prince,' “ that at Lad;
Warwick’s luncheon I saw you select a cigar wopth
having. It is a weakness I have myself, and I sup-
pose that is how I came to notice, you. This,” ha
added, “is what I provide for my own use,” and ha
took from a superbly-mounted case a magnificent-

It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Co.’s ‘‘Cascade,”
80 and 82 Elizabeth-street) near King-street, is
just the place ; it is certainly the largest and besb
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there, so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*
Society
Their womenfolk have been the ruin of
Australian politicians. No sooner does a gentle-
man, so-called, ally with democracy than “society”
brings the pinch to bear on his wife by ostracising
her. Thus M'Culloch was a bachelor when he
made his democratic fight, but married exactly at
the time when he began to return to the Conserva-
tive fold. Place “ Lady ” within a woman’s grasp!

It is said that a giddy young Sydney ex-
official of 90 years was not long since most anxious
to espouse (and would hardly take “no” for an
answer), en troisieme noces, the widow of a certain
well-known University professor who did so much a
few years ago to draw attention to Smollett’s chef
(Toeuvre.' But the lady had had enough of one
man Friday. This is the widow’s own story.

Illustrated London News prints a por-
trait group, taken at Warwick Castle, comprising
the Prince of Wales, Prince George, Duke of York,
Prince Christian, the Earl of Warwick, and G.
R. Dibbs, K.C.M.G., with a lot of other swells.
There is one feature of the group which will make
Parkes madder than all the rest. The nobleman
next to Dibbs is Lord Leigh, Lady Jersey ’s father,
on whose estate Parkes was born. Now, Parkes
always affected, since Lady Jersey and the Hon.
Rupert Leigh came to N.S.W., a sorb of patent
proprietorship of the Leigh family, and here has
Dibbs jumped that claim in addition to that other
private property of Parkes’, the Premiership !
# # #
The popularity of George Dibbs amongst
the British haut ton, writes The Bulletin corres-
pondent by last mail, in no way diminishes; on
the contrary, he experiences the utmost difficulty
in fulfilling all his social engagements. Last
Sunday, Lady Londonderry gave a “swagger”
luncheon-party for his delectation. He had ex-
pressed so much admiration for the beauty and
style of English young ladies, that the Marchioness
promised him a “beauty show,” and invited the
cream of London’s pretty'women to meet him.
Park Lane was blocked by people who stood out-
side Londonderry House watching the arrivals.
* * #
Critchett Walker’s photograph was osten-
tatiously borne on the bosom of Mrs. Bardwell in
the trial scene from “Pickwick,” which (arranged
by George Dibbs) was played on board the Orotava
on her voyage to London from Sydney. How it
came to be worn may be told anon.
Mrs. Harrison Lee, lecturing at Orange,
N.S.W., to children on temperance, argued that
because animals didn’t drink beer, therefore
bipeds ought to go without. Now, goats don’t
wear garters, therefore women oughtn’t to wear
garters.
* * #
A Melbourne supporter of Mrs. Harrison
Lee : “ The pigstye production of inferior
children, with no opportunity for their education,
is at the very root of this distress. The delusion
fast vanishes that the mere production of greater
numbers of inferior human creatures is the grand
factor of national prosperity, and in this poverty-
stricken country people even have the cheek to
demand a Bachelor Tax.”

“His learned friend had suggested that
this being a case in reference to bananas they

The Rov. O. Fox (N.S.W.) says that the
presence of the unemployed is chiefly due to the
absence of any public acknowledgment of God !
Why, the very men who habitually make the

“The Holy Grunt” is the text of a capital

How t) avoid payment of probate-duty.

Mrs Ross-Fairfax (with a hyphen, please,
and without the initial E.) has been entertaining
very largely this season at her house at Princes
Gate, London. She does things very well indeed.
A NECESSARY EXPLANATION.
STAGGERED NEW-CHUM (after hearing useful disclosures): “Bai jove! Are there no honest
men in Melbourne, then?”
DEJECTED CITIZEN : “Yes, plenty, but they’re mostly unemployed at present.”
The Australian element is predominant for the
moment at her functions.

Dear Bulletin,-— You lately noted that a
certain wealthy Australian was being piloted in
London by Sir Somers Vine. One good turn
deserves another : the son of Sir Somers is located
on Millar Bros.’ Torbay Estate, W.A. By the
way, Messrs. Millar imported some 20 Chinamen
from Port Darwin to put the estate in order, but
half of them did three months’gaol rather than
stick to their agreement. The others are still on
the job, and young Somers Vine is gaining
colonial experience with a gang of Chinkies.—
Yours, Westward Ho.

The yarn cabled out about the fire in the
bedroom of Princess Beatrice—Mrs. Henry
Battenberg—is altogether too thin. The story is
that a clumsy chambermaid ignited the bed-
curtains. Qui s’excuse, etc. Our distinct suspicion
is that, if the actual facts were known, it would
be discovered that Trixy was smoking in bed.
They all smoke nowadays. And why shouldn’t
they ? A Brisbane man we know generalises thus
—“ Women who smoke don’t drink.”
Reviewing Gilbert Parker’s book, “Round
the Compass in Australia,” the Sydney Morning
Herald, after remarking that most of the matter
first appeared in the Herald’s own columns, goes
on to affirm that Mr. Parker has written with
“ vivacity,” and that “ there are no dull pages in
the book.” Evidently the Herald people fancy
its columns sparkle with wit, and—well, a Herald
leading article is generally laughable.
# # #
A well-advertised young man is Mr. Hoff-
nung, (late of Sydney) the Hawaiian —haw !
Charge d' Affaires in London. By dint of —er—
perseverance, he has become recognised as one of
the regular Corps Diplomatique, though his duties
must be exceedingly light, for the sable potentate
whom he represents has few (if any) subjects
abroad, and the burning questions which call for
his diplomatic intervention are most infrequent.
However, they “serve,” as the immortal Williams
puts it, and that is quite enough. Have you in
Sydney and Melbourne, remarks our London
correspondent, seen the number of ambassadors
whose only duties are to wear gaudy uniforms and
claim entree to levees and to eat a bad dinner once
a year ?
* * #
The N.S.W. lawyers have had another dip
into the well lined pockets of the applicant in the
cause celbere of Tyson v. Tyson. Darley, C.J.,
sitting in divorce jurisdiction, made the rule nisi
absolute; and yet a lawyer suggested to the
already well-bled Tyson that it should be confirmed
by the Full Court in order to be binding. The
Full Court ridiculed the suggestion, and reminded
counsel that the decision of the Judge sitting in
divorce was the decision of the Supreme Court if
not appealed against.
* # *
Adelaide Employers’ Union has a rule
preventing a member from offering an engagement
to any employe in the pay of a. Union firm. Is
this to keep down wages or to protect the
capitalists from each other?
People are saying that there really must
be a difference in the status of offenders in S. A.
Public Service. When the defaulter with no
friends went to his “ boss ’ and frankly confessed
his mistake, he was hauled up before the beak
without any hesitation, but the “ well-connected ”
officer, who lied about it when found out, was
given three days to clear, and allowed to repay the
money.
* * #
There was a lot of ghastly significance in
the hallucination of Henry Brock, a IMelbourne
auctioneer, who suicided in England, the other
day. When business disasters had shaken his
brain poor Brock slunk away under the wrong im-
pression that he was amenable to the law.
Directly a man goes crazy in Melbourne, these
times, he jumps to the conclusion that he ought to
be locked up, and, generally speaking, he doesn’t
make the same mistake as Brock.
* * #
“And there are so many old ladies,” sug-
gested Mrs. Brough in “The Times.” “ Yes—if
they’d only admit it,” said Miss Homer. It was
in the same comedy that Cecil Ward had to
account for his mesalliance with a lodging-house-
keeper’s daughter by mentioning that “Honoria
used to lay the cloth.” What a world of meaning
in that simple statement! No ordinary bachelor
(or rational married man) can contemplate a trim
damsel laying the cloth without experiencing a
wild desire to slip his arm round her waist and
hug her tight. It must be the bending attitude
that fetches ’em.
Lady Sarah Wilson, it appears. In,

A well known Sydney lady lately dis-
charged—without any apparent reason-two
female servants who had been in her service
over 20 years. One of her friends inquired tlm
reason of their dismissal, when Mrs De P„h
replied, without a blush, “ Well, you see thev
were getting rather old, and as I don’t think thev
saved their money, of course if they trot ski
or died the expenses would fall upon me and
that, my dear, would be outrageous, so I srotViH

In re the death of Paddy Coglin, of
Adelaide, it is related that on one occasion a
journal having published a premature announce-
ment of his decease, a certain Adelaide lawyer
sent a note, offering to do, with cheapness and
despatch, all law woik connected with the estate.
Lhis was duly handed to Paddy, who got another
lawyer to pen a scathing reply. The legal cheap
.Jack wasn t seen again for weeks.

In Sydney District Court, the other clay,
Judge Backhouse disposed of 235 cases in five

The Sydney Hospital medical squabble,

Justice A’Beckett (Vic.) decided last week
that it was not the correct thing for a woman who
had divorced her husband and obtained an order
for £4 a, week against him, but who had re-married,

I he Judge accordingly upset a long-standing and
pheasant little theory to the contrary, much to the
lady’s chagrin.

Heard at a Salvation meeting in a Vic-
torian town the other evening Adjutant (ad-
dressing the exhausted crowd, which had whooped
itself dry vociferating a hymn) ; “Now, brethren,
once more give it lip! Drop your lower jaws!
There’s nobody to sec you in Uiis*light, so drop
your lower jaws about a foot, and give out the
word of God !” And then everybody opened a
mouth like a gas-main, and the last verse came
out with a shriek that rent the heavens, and woke
the policeman, and startled every dog in a half-
mile radius.

John Thurlow, a troubled lover, the other
night, shot his sweetheart, Miss Amy Elvina
Guest, of Woolloomooloo (Svdney, N.S.W.),in the
forehead while she was asleep in bed. The
weapon used was a six-chambered double-action
“Young America” revolver, and it was fired at
close quarters and point-blank. And this is what
happened, in Miss Guest’s own words : “ I awoke
suddenly, feeling a stinging sensation in my head.
Putting up my hand to my forehead, I felt wet
blood and a hard lump. I lifted up the lump and
saw it Was a revolver-bullet.” An inch of sticking-
plaster remedied the hurt. Miss Guest may be
congratulated upon the massive solidity of her
frontal bone. The “ Young America ” gun is
harmless on “Young Australia.'”

That delectable nobleman, our old Adelaide
friend, the Earl of Euston, is an “R. W. Prov.
“A FIRST LOVE-LETTER.”
Love that is earnest and born of the passions of Nature’s
bestowing
Fears that its dearest desire be a bubble of Vanity’s
blowing ;
Therefore it hath not courage and seeks not itself to
proclaim.
Deeming itself unworthy and living in constant shame.
True love is no vain boasting braggart, but worships in
silence afar,
Cherishing dreams that may vanish and clinging to hope
as a spar.
What if this Love be requited with Love? Ah! let us
rejoice,
For much hath it borne since trembling to life at the
sound of thy voice.
What if this Love be a vain thing? Ah, God ! then were
all things vain,
And the sky of the future were clouded, and Life but a
day of rain,
And a sorrowful mist would envelop the vision of things
to be,
And the winds and the waves would mourn for my soul-
stricken agony,
The Dawn would but waken my shame, and the Sun were
a hateful sight.
The darkness of Death would be mercy, and kind were the
blackness of night ;
And never again while the Soul and the Earth and the
Heavens meet
Would Light shine unbroken on peace that is perfect!v
sweet.

married her within a few days, palmed off a bogus
cheque for the wedding-ring, imposed upon the
officiating parson with another duffer, and deserted
his wife the morning after the wedding. Those
people who are continually advertising for active
and energetic youths had better look out for this
treasure. # #
Mrs. Walter Coote, daughter of the late
B. E. Bunny, Commissioner for Titles (Vic.), is
booked to take unto herself a second hubby this
week, one Mr. Jones—writes The Bulletin’s
London correspondent by last mail. How is it,
by the way, that so many widows marry whilst
numbers of pretty girls sigh for the man who
never turns up ?

This is how they say “ Wanted a Barmaid ”
up North (in Winton Herald, Q.) :
WANTED, for the North Gregory Hotel, a lady
help bar-conductor. Must have a thorough
knowledge of blending liquors, and a keen perception
of the male gender, to enable her to conduct business
on scientific and commercial principles. To an artiste
of the first water pecuniary consideration no object,
together with having two (2) days per week for
equestrian exercise, and two (2) evenings to entertain
her gentlemen friends, with the use of the piano to
keep up the harmony of the evening. Should she
feel indisposed after the evening’s amusement, the
Boas personally will immediately attend to all private
or public engagements until an absolute recovery is
effected. Apply personally to W. B. STEELE, North
Gregory Hotel, Winton, July 27th, 1892.

Whilst a Carlton (Melb.) woman was at
church on Sunday night week burglars entered
her house and got away with £25 worth of

who leaves £25 worth of jewellery at home when

The “prevailing depression” is at least
serving a good purpose in teaching the bourgeois
business man and the shop-keeping class generally
that their prosperity is almost entirely dependent
upon that of the workers. Fifteen or sixteen
thousand unemployed in Melbourne, and a great
many in addition compelled to subsist upon half-
time pay, and small businesses are going to the
deuce generally. Sweet are the uses of adversity.

Have you ever heard that Police Court
story about lawyer Yilleneuve Smith, of Adelaide,
and his cross-examination of the lady who kept a
house which wasn’t exactly a convent ?
* * *
They are talking a good deal in a certain
Northern watering-place about a mysterious
event which occurred a week or two ago. It was
late one calm, starry night, and the only sound in
the air was the gentle wash of the Pacific on the
sandy shore, when suddenly a pistol-shot rang out
from the cottage of a Japanese resident, and the
father of all howls rent the air. Thereupon the
startled policeman—there is only one—girded up
his loins and raced for the spot. But when he got
to the cottage all was still. The front and back
doors were both open : the Japanese wasn’t
to be found, neither was his wife, though
there were footmarks in the garden as if the lady
had fled suddenly ; and there was a bullet-hole in
the wall just above the bed. And when the
officer looked under the bed he found an alderman
and ex-member of Parliament in a semi-paralytic
condition, and hauled him out by the legs. He
said that he had gone there to light his pipe out of
the wind, and assured the officer that lie had seen
and heard nothing, and then he gave a shriek and
ran for home. The story remains at that; nobody
has thrown any light on it since.

In Hill End cemetery, N.S.W., ,tii old
public-house sign is used as the head-board of a
grave. On one side is set forth that the deceased
was born in 18— and died in 18—, and that in
between these dates she was a loving wife and a
good mother. In faded letters, beneath this
inscription, there appears the legend : “Licensed
to sell fermented and spirituous liquors.”
An 11 in re gent one ” lately dealt with by
N.S.W. Supreme Court has called a meeting of his
creditors. However, there is such a process as
attachment for contempt of order of Court. The
amount at stake exceeds £lOOO.

Last Session in N.S.W. a Bill was passed
effecting a partial amalgamation of the legal pro-
fessions of barrister and attorney. A Sydney
police court practitioner has given the innovation
practical effect; his office is opposite a court house

This is the true story of a policeman, a
barmaid, and a Sydney remittance-man. The
latter was known generally as “ Chummy,” pre-
sumably because ho was a new-chum ; he got his
remittance every quarter, and for three weeks or
so after getting it he was in an irresponsible state
and affectionately maudlin. It was at one of
these periods that he walked abroad late at night
with two bright halfpennies in his pocket, and in
a humorous moment gave one of them to a bar-
maid in payment of a drink. The golden-haired
angel was sleepy, and taking the coin she solemnly
gave him IDs. 6d. change, and “Chummy” de-
parted in a state of muddled complacency. Less
than five minutes later Tottie discovered her
mistake, and in just a quarter of an hour a police-
man laid his heavy hand on the delinquent at his
lodgings. Then the remittance gentleman rose to
the occasion. “Loo’ here old — hie— chappie, ish
all right, on’y my lil shoko, y’know. There’sh
shquid f’r ye an’ come back an’ shee me pay Tottie
her sovereign.” The officer’s great soul melted
at the appeal ; he took the “ quid,” the
bar - maiden got her money back, and the
offender went his devious way. Then the con-
stable remarked that lie thought he would have
a drink also, and laid the other bright half-penny
on the counter, and the girl shrieked when she
saw the coin, and there was weeping and gnash-
ing of teeth and much assorted execration.

A share-dealer, with a tendency to extrava-
gance, was once up on an unsatisfied judgment-
summons before an Adelaide court. Evidence
was being given as to his means, and the plaintiff
said—“ He ought to pay, your Worship, for I saw
him and all his family in the dress-circle at the
theatre the other night.” “ Deadheads, your
Worship, deadheads —every one of them !” eagerly
interjected defendant. “ Then,” continued plain-

of the proprietries.”
He (a Broken Hill shareholder): “I wish I hadn’t taken any notice of ’em when they were a

tiff, “ I have seen him drinking champagne and
other costly wines ’’ “ Somebody else pays,
your Worship, somebody else pays,” was the
comment of the unabashed debtor. As a last
resource the indignant capitalist cried—“l never
meet him without a good cigar in his month.”
“ And I never bought one of them myself,” was
the crushing reply. No order was made. It was
the same broker who once declared that he could
return a lamp-post to Parliament if he was allowed
enough money. He was a doughty election-agent
in those days, but now principle has more power
than purse in South Australia.

Jack Dunn, of Neverti[?].
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It chanced upon the very day we’d got the shearing
done
A buggy brought a stranger to the Grog-au’-
Grumble Run ;
Ho had a round and jolly face, and he was sleek
and stout,
He drove right up between the huts an’ called the
super, out.
We chaps were smoking round the sheds and heard
the swell enquire
Eor one us travelled by the name of “Dunn, of
Nevertire.”
Jack Dimn, of Nevertire,
Poor Dunn, of Nevertire ;
There wasn’t one of us but knew Jack Dunn, of
Nevertire.
“Jack Dunn, of Nevertire,” lie said, “I was a
mate of his,
An’ now it’s twenty year since I set eyes upon his
phiz.
There is no whiter man than Jack - no straighter
south the line,
There is no hand in all the land I’d sooner grip in
mine :
To help a mate in trouble Jack would go thro’
flood and fire.
Great Scott! and don’t you know the name of
Dunn, of Nevertire?
‘Big Dunn,’ of Nevertire,
Long Jack from Nevertire ;
He stuck to mo thro’ thick and thin, Jack Dunn,
of Nevertire.
“ I did a wild and foolish thing while Jack and I
were mates,
And I disgraced my guv’nor's name ’n’ wished to
try the States. ,
My lamps were turned to Yankee Land, for I’d
some people there,
And I was right when someone sent the money for
my faro;
I thought ’twas Dad until I took the trouble to
enquire,
And found that he who sent the stuff was Dunn,
of Nevertire,
Jack Dunn, of Nevertire,
‘Soft’ Dunn, of Nevertire ;
He’d won some money on a race —Jack Dunn, of
Nevertire.
Now I’ve returned by Liverpool, a swell of Yankee
brand,
To reckon, guess, and kalkitate, V wake me
native land ;
There is no better land, I swear, in all the wide
world round—
I smelt the bush a month before we touch’d King
George’s Sound !
And now I’ve come to settle down, the top of my
desire
Is just to meet a good old friend called Dunn, of
Nevertire;
Was raised at Nevertire —
The town of Nevertire;
He humped his bluey by the name of ‘Dunn, of
Nevertire.
“ I’ve heard he’s poor, and, if he is, a proud old
fool is he,
But, ’spite of that, I’ll find a way to fix the old
gum-tree.
I’ve bought a station in the North—the best that
could be had ;
I want a man to pick the stock—l want a super,
bad ;
I want no bully-brute to boss—no crawling, sneak-
ing liar,
My station super, ’s name shall be, Jack Dunn, of
Nevertire !
‘Straight,’ Dunn, of Nevertire,
Old Dnnn, of Nevertire;
I guess he’s known up Queensland way—Jack
Dunn, of Nevertire.”
The super, said, while to his face a strange expres-
sion came;
“I think I’ve seen the man you want, I think 1
know the name ;
Had he a jolly kind of face—a free and careless
way,
Grey eyes that always seem’d to smile and hail
just turning grey —
Clean-shaved, except a light ‘ mustarsh,’ long
limbed, an’ tough as wire? ”
“That's him! That’s Dunn!” the strangei
roar’d, “Jack Dunn, of Nevertire !
John Dunn, of Nevertire,
Jack D., from Nevertire,
They said I’d find him here, the cuss ! —Jack
Dunn, of Nevertire.”
“I’d know his walk,” the stranger roar’d, “tho-
sobered, I’ll allow.”
“I doubt it much,” the boss replied, “lie don’t
walk that way now.”
“Perhaps he don’t 1” the stranger said, “for years
were hard on Jack,
But, if he were a mile away, I swear I’d know his
back.”
“I doubt it much,” the super, said, and sadly
puffed his briar,
“ I guess he wears a pair of wings-Jack Dunn,
of Nevertire,
Jack Dunn, of Nevertire,
Brave Dunn, of Nevertire,
Ho caught a fever nursing me, Jack Dunn, of
Nevertire.”
We took the stranger round to whore a gum-tree
stood alone,
And in the grass beside the trunk he saw a granite
stone,
The names of Dunn and Nevertire were plainly
written there—
“l’m all broke up,” the stranger said, in sorrow
and despair,
“I guess he has a wider run—the man that I
require,
lie’s got a river-frontage now, Jack Dunn, of
Nevertire,
‘ Straight Dunn,’ of Nevertire,
White Jack, from Nevertire,
I guess Saint Peter knew the name of Dunn, of
Nevertire.”

Melbourne publicans have lowered their
drinks in consequence of the increased duties.
They are so low now that few men care to descend
to them.
Melbourne police authorities are diaboli-
cally cunning ; they occasionally introduce a
number of constables from one suburb to “lay
for ” the Sunday traders in another, but the
publicans are more cunning still—their friends in
the local force always “lay them on” to these
little raids.
J. B. Patterson said, in the Victorian
Assembly the other night, that preaching politics
on the banks of the Yarra on Sunday shakes
English confidence. The British investor will
never put his trust in us again till we go to church
regularly on Sundays and all join the Orange
Lodge.
Dear Bulletin, —Does your artist, “A.F.,”
imagine a digger gnaws his way into the bowels
of the globe and swallows the earth ? If not, why
does he represent a shaft without any indications
of a tip? This is so common a mistake amongst
local scene-painters and Melbourne and Sydney
black-and-white men, that I venture a respectful
snort.—Yours, Snell.
Dear Bulletin,— The Riverina (N.S.W.)
newspapers contain various advts. cautioning
travellers against poisoned water. These notices
may bo sufficient for the squatter, or the news-
paper-reading drover, but it is ridiculous to
suppose that one per cent, of ordinary bushtnen
“ humping bluey ” ever read the local papers.
On the One-tree Plain, beyond Hay, N.S. \V., for
instance, all along the stock-route and right on to
the road, nearly every crabhole has been poisoned,
and the energetic rabbit-agents have quite for-
gotten to post up any notice warning bushtnen
against using the water. Any new-clmm travel-
ing alone out there goes to almost certain death.
The terrors of the track are sufficiently formidable
at any time, without adding to them such artificial
dangers. Severe penalties should be visited upon
any water-poisoner who neglects to post on the
spot a notification of his act.

A Funny Game.
A few friends met the other night in a Newtown
store to spend a jovial evening, but as they were
all teetotallers and none of them drank anything
stronger than Clements Tonic, drunkenness was
out of the question. Mac. proposed a game
at euchre, and Jones said they had better play for
something just to give the game an interest and
make it lively, but times were hard, so they did
not care to play for money. Smith, however,
spied a box of Fletcher's bilious and liver pills,
and proposed that each time a man was beaten bo
should take a pill, and this made the game lively
and the fun was fast and furious. Simpson
swallowed five, Jones .got away with four and
Smith and Hopkins two each and Mac. got off
scot free. The game terminated by, a general
exodus at 3 a.in., for Dr. Fletcher’s pills never
labour in vain. They are the best and mildest
pills made and are sold by all chemists and
druggists everywhere; being a positive, safe,
and reliable cure for constipation, liver complaint,
headache, &c. They always give satisfaction.
The proprietors give away £5O (in seven prizes) at
Xmas, for the seven first nearest guesses sent in,
as to how many of these pills a large Clements
Tonic bottle (now full) holds. A guess form is
around every box, and all such forms are eligible
for this competition that come from around a box.
One box of Fletcher’s Pills proves their virtues
and they can be obtained everywhere at Is., or
post free 13 penny stamps, from F. M. Clements,
Newtown, N.S.W.

KARANA.
WHEN the digestive organs are out of order
a good, reliable tonic is required to bring
them back to their normal state.
A number of persons upset the stomach by
neglecting to take their meals at regular stated
intervals, and others again eat to excess at some
particular meal—and from these causes the
machinery gets out of order and does not run
smoothly. Late suppers, also, are one of the
causes of upsetting the digestive organs.
Sister Mary Joseph Albert, in her researches
amongst the plants of New Zealand, has dis-
covered there is a very valuable remedy for these
complaints in our-own vegetation, and after ex-
perimenting for a number of years, has now
brought forward the medicine called KARANA.
Dr. LaßOChetee, a chemist of the First Class
of the Faculty of Paris, to whom samples were
sent, says : —“lt is an excellent bitter tonic, and
I consider it even superior to the preparation of
Cinchona in all affections of the stomach. It has
given us, prepared as you sent it, the most satis-
factory results.”
The Reverend Sister says she has used it for
many years extensively and successfully with
sufferers of every age and constitution, and she
noticed that in a few cases it did not agree at first,
but by diminishing the dose good results followed.
She remarked astonishing good results on old
people, who had ruined their constitutions by the
abuse of intoxicating drink, and who were debili-
tated and suffering after having turned over a
new leaf.
ENQUIRE WITHIN!
DO you suffer from Headache and Dizziness in
the head ; have you pains under the ribs or
shoulders ; are you affected with heartburn or in-
digestion? If so, have you ever asked yourself
why this is? You certainly are allowing two of
the chief organs in your structure to become
neglected. The liver and kidneys are responsible
for these ill feelings, and you are getting too much
work out of them without attending to their
wants in the particular functions they have to
sustain.
These organs are in continual play day and
night, waking or sleeping, and any constitution
will not stand, be it ever so good, if its internal
requirements are not attended to.
The liver and kidneys cannot put up with re-
pudiation, and they soon let you know it, and it
is highly necessary that “Paramo” should be
administered to their wants. This vegetable pre-
paration is particularly adapted to these com-
plaints, and those persons who have already taken
it assure us they never felt better in their lives.
Mother Mary Joseph Aubert has been particu-
larly successful with “ Paramo,” and is daily
receiving numberless enquiries in reference to it.
The agents are continually getting letters and
telegrams from all parts of New Zealand, and
have confidence in saying that no other remedies
are giving the same amount of general satisfaction.
Give “Paramo” a fair trial, and note how
quickly your mental depression leaves you. It is
worth the experiment, and will certainly do no
harm.
Taradale, September 10, 1891.
Dear Sister, —I have very great pleasure in
testifying to the value of your remedies, as they
were used in my family with wonderful effect for
many years, and I am especially grateful to you
for saving the life of my daughter when others
said she would not live.
Trusting you may live long to help and cure the
suffering.
I am,
Yours faithfully,
W. LORD.
New Zealand Tablet, 16th. October, 1891.
The religious orders continue to maintain their
reputations as benefactors of Society in temporal
as well as in spiritual matters. A new proof of
this is furnished in the remedies which have been
discovered by the Sister Mary Joseph Aubert.
The good Sister, whose life has been devoted to
the instruction of the Maoris, while she has
laboured successfully at improving their minds
and enlightening their spirits, lias not been
neglectful to their bodies. The result is the dis-
covery of a series of medicines manufactured from
native trees and plants, and which have been
proved undeniably to be of almost marvellous
efficacy. It is to the credit of the Catholic Church
in the Colony that one of its missionary Sisters
has distinguished herself in this way, probably
conferring on the world a benefit, little, if any-
thing, inferior to that conferred, for example, by
the Jesuit Fathers who discovered the curative
properties of the Peruvian bark. Not only suffer-
ing humanity but science itself owes a debt to
this lady, who has made it acquainted with pro-
perties of natural products, hitherto unsuspected,
and has enriched the pharmacopoeia. We have,
further, in the matter, an instance of how
religious devotion is calculated to quicken the
faculties and to develop the best qualities of
human nature. Sister Mary Joseph is to be
warmly commended for her discoveries, and in-
deed, the community generally may be congratu
lated on them.

“German
Syrup”
Here is an incident from the South
—Mississippi, written in April, 1890,
just after the Grippe had visited that
country. “lam a farmer, one of
those who have to rise early and
work late. At the beginning of last
Winter I was on a trip to the City
of Vicksburg, Miss.,where I got well
drenched in a shower of rain. I
went home and was soon after seized
with a dry, hacking cough. This
grew worse every day, until I had
to seek relief. I consulted Dr. Dixon
who has since died, and he told me
to get a.bottle of Boschee’s German
Syrup. Meantime my cough grew
worse and worse and then the Grippe
came along and I caught that also
very severely. My condition tfie 11
compelled me to do something. I
got two bottles of German Syrup. I
began using them, and before taking
much of the second bottle, I was
entirely clear of the Cough that had
hung to me so long, the Grippe, and
all its bad effects. I felt tip-top and
have felt that way ever since.”

Dear Bulletin,—Re your fly-flat-fool rhyme, I
have seen cases where “ the talent ” didn’t come off bes .
Eor instance, somewhere between Serviceton and Mel-
bourne, just before a big race-meeting, in a second-class
compartment were a crowd of sharps and a few Hats.
One flat in particular was thought worthy of the attention
of “ the talent,” a member of which was offering to bet
that in one cut of a common pack of cards he could cut
the Jack of Spades-he would bet anything from a pound
up that he could do it. Well, this particular flat (not
flvl was greatly impressed, and wagered £5 he couldn t.
The fiat asked to have a look at the pack to make sure
that Mister Jack was there, and then handed back the
cards to the sharp, who asked Flat to hold one end of the
pack firmly. He himself took hold of the other end, and
producing a razor cut the pack clean through the middle,
exclaiming: “There you are, sonny! Ive cut him m
one cut!” “No you didn t, replied the flat, for 1
quietly took Mr. Jack out of the pack when I was looking
at the cards at the same time producing the Jack and
annexing £lO. Then you could have heard an elephant
drop among the clever division.

Totalisator talk in the Yic. Legislature and
press hasn’t touched upon one of the most important
points in favour of the machine. Being licensed for the
course only, it would tend to get the public out of the
baneful habit of backing horses in town, and help them
to “keep off betting,” except when they were haying a
day’s fresh air for their money. The argument that
bookmakers only supply a genuine demand for gambling
is utter bosh, as anybody acquainted with the rise and
fall of list-betting in England can testify. How oft the
sßht of means to do ill deeds makes ill deeds done ! ihe
foul-mouthed bookmaker is that opportunity. People
who »o to the races won’t bet any more than formerly,
but rather less, on account of a machine that lays legiti-
mate odds, whilst people who now fritter away their
punting-money in town, will have no “sporting cigai-
shops to go to, even if they wanted to go. And they
won’t want to go when the absurdity of taking the old
rates of starting prices has been exposed.

“Toby ” Moran was “ sent-up'” for 12 months

favourite at Mooretield on Saturday.

Next Saturday, a fair field of horses will be
seen out for the Caulfield Grand National Steeplechase, a
four-mile race over a course which is heaviest in diy
weather. The likelihood of Redleap running in this
event (if he isn’t saddled up for the Hurdle Race) has
attracted a little extra attention to it and a few rash
punters have already backed that noble animal at short
prices. The stable are not likely to hack Redleap until
the last moment, anyway, and in the meantime he is far
from being a certainty for either Steeple or Hurdle.
O’Brien believes he has a “dead bird in Ireeman, the
Maoriland horse that fell in the Flemmgton G.N., and yet
managed to heat some of those that didn t fall, rieeman
was the only one the Millers feared on Redleap s great
day and if they don’t bring their crack out against him,
Freeman should be quite good enough to put a sovereign
on. * *

Memo, for the Sydney police : — The other
evening the writer was sitting on the box-seat of a
Sydney ’bus when a notorious pugilist and member of one
of the “pushes” got into the vehicle with a girl. The
driver rang for fares a couple of times, but on the second
ringing the larrikin, without putting tickets in the box,
replied with an oath that he had paid. “ Why don’t you
have him put out?” the scribe asked the driver. “I’d
pay the money myself in preference,” was the reply.
“The ‘push’ would lay wait in a quiet street, smash
every window in the ’bus, and lay me out with blue
metal.”

J. J. Ferris suffers in popularity because of the
more than doubtful method adopted to convert him into
a full-blown English cricketer, and no one who has the
interest of cricket at heart regrets that his first appear-
ance for “ his county,” was anything but a brilliant one.
It was thought that there might have been some objec-
tion to his playing against Surrey, but none was raised.
He had a “ duck ” in the first innings, and made only five
runs in the second ; whilst the five wickets he took cost
106 runs. As a great cricket authority put it, Gloucester-
shire might have cribbed a far luckier if not better man
much nearer home than Australia.
M. Heileger, of Yerviers, France, wants
to settle 100 French peasants and their families in
the Gunbower district of Victoria. He asks for
1000 acres of irrigable land, with water-supply
convenient, suitable for fruit-growing and viticul-
ture, with the option of taking an additional area
of 2000 acres within a specified period. He offers
to forward £20,000 as a financial earnest of his
hond-fides.
It is wise to provide against emergencies which
are liable to arise in every family. In sudden
attacks of cold, croup, asthma, etc,, a bottle of
Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral will prove a never-failing
remedy.
A discovery has been made in George-
street, near the G.P.O., the result of excavations
carried on there some time ago. After getting
down about 15 feet, a perfect grotto came into
view, about 60 feet square, built of solid masonry,
and lit by electricity. All those who have seen it
express unbounded surprise and satisfaction with
this-natural phenomenon. It is now open for
public inspection and has been named the Sydney
Safe Deposit.*
“ Under the title of the ‘ Popular Musical
Album,’ Mr. H. J. Samuellhas issued a magazine
which contains 11 tuneful pieces very well and
clearly printed. The words of the songs are care-
fully allotted to the musical phrases to the con-
venience of the singer, and the whole_ is included
in a gaily-coloured cover which supplies a pretty
portrait inscribed ‘Marion Hood.’ Amongst the
comic songs are ‘The Day I Played Baseball,
‘ The Lone Fish Ball,’ and ‘ She Stands Behind a
Counter.’ Sentiment is represented by the effec-
tive solo, with harmonised chorus, ‘ A Mother s
Appeal to her Boy,’ and ‘Only a Picture’ is
another pretty ballad to which full choral parts
are appended. ‘ Pretty as a Butterfly ’ will be
found a tender little sentimental ditty ; and the
new magazine also includes an ‘Andante and
Entr’acte,’ by M. Poussard ; the ‘Jersey Lancers,
the ‘ Zelraa Waltzes,’ and ‘The Picture that is
Turned Towards the Wall.’ From this it will be
seen that the Popular Musical Album has been
compiled to suit the tastes of various classes in its
special line, as it ranges from the rattling comic
song to the ballad of which the burthen is seriously
sentimental.” — From Sydney Morning Herald,

A REAL MAN OF MARK.
Heir Rassmussen s Cures are so remarkable that we
make no apology for referring to some of them. Mr. Rains-
den’s case is the most wonderful, and his remedies cured him
in six weeks, aft. rm ny Sydney doctors gave Ii n up. We
may also state that a gentleman in this district, who has
been a martyr to the demon Dyspepsia for more than two
years, after trying several “ doctors ” with no benefit what-
ever, is recovering under Herr Rassmussen's Herbal
Remedies. Herr Rassmussen possesses undoubted skill, and
we wish him a long life to continue his useful mission iii the
cause of suffering humanity.”—Kangaroo Valley Pioneer,
A JUST REWARD.
“Herr Rassmussen, of whose famous Herbal Remedies
everybody has heard, has held the position of Lecturer to
several Botanic Societies in Australia; he soon became
known by the wonderful cures effected by his remedies, of
which he has numerous tokens of gratefulness, including a
beautiful Gold Medal, brought him into the front rank of
botanic scientists. We have seen and examined letters from
all parts of the world—are assured that he has saved a world
of suffering and cured people of many complaints, after they
had given up all hope.”—The Australian Workman.
—Sydney, 9th January, 1892.
WHO IS RASSMUSSEN?
“ Herr Rassmussen is a wonder. We have sufficient
proof that his Remedies have cured thousands. He was
awarded a Gold Medal for his Alfaline Remedies, and he is
author of some valuable Medical Works. We hope he will
be as successful in Victoria as he has been in New South
Wales.”—The Essen den and Flemington Chronicle and

WHAT IS PAIN?
EVK'IYBODY knows what pain is. What is
• t V It is doubtful whether one person out of
, P) oan define the term. We have all ex-
CV . L - uiiced the sensation in some form or other,
'"'I] 13 know all about it, from the enterprising
a,|( .Jester who has been caught prospecting the
'^ UU clipboard, to the festive old buffer who had
1.1’“ cl .‘ uo t wisely, but too well,” and is receiving
.'rticular sheol from Ids old enemy, the gout. We
|’ a ve however, searched and inquired in vain for
I ’ ause that is to say, what is tiie action that is
Uituating in the bodily frame that causes us to
r' 1 t he sensation of physical pain. All the
authorities we have referred to define the effect,
but not the cause.
I'lio following is an example from a leading
reference : “ Pain is an indefinite term with
respect to the degree of suffering. It may be very
ereat or very small. Pang, is a sudden, sharp
min - agony, a violent, continued pain; torture,
excruciating extreme pain; anguish, an over-
whelming pain.” _ .
Perhaps some scientific reader will oblige us by
ijlving the information we desire, and until then
wo must remain satisfied to know the effect, and
what is of still more importance, how to alleviate
ami euro it, That which sets the pain in motion,
whether it be a bruise, a sprain, neuralgia, rheu-
matism, lumbago, or other kindred ailments can,
;is has been amply proved, be safely and most
certainly cured by the far-famed St. Jacobs Oil,
the boon and blessing of rich and poor. Mr. W.
Kenny, of Bloomfield street, Surry Hills, under
date June 4th, 1891. writes : St. Jacobs Oil is the
best remedy I ever knew for pains of all kinds. I
have used it for lumbago, also for sprains, and it
has always proved a certain and rapid cure. I
formerly lived up country in the neighbourhood of
Molousr, and all round there the people swear
by it.

For the Cure of
All throat and lung diseases, Ayer’s Cherry
Pectoral is the best known remedy. When the
bronchial tubes are sore and obstructed with
phlegm, this medicine is invaluable. It is an
anodyne expectorant, and, in cases of deep
seated consumption, it cures the coughing,
soothes and heals the lacerated tissues, and
induces refreshing sleep. A few doses are usu-
ally sufficient to afford speedy relief in cases of
Colds and Coughs
It is also as speedily efficacious, and prompt
to allay the distressing symptoms of asthma,
bronchitis, sore throat, hoarseness, croup, and
whooping cough, and, in' thousands of fami-
lies, is the only cure used. It is the best emer-
gency medicine and should always be at hand.
No household in which there are young chil-
dren, can afford to be without

Rev. J. Milne Curran, F.Gt.S., has an idea that
the present writer has been “badly bitten at Pambula.”
The rev. gentleman is in error: the scribe saw the field in
its early stages and has seen it several times since, but
never touched it. Father Curran’s superabundant praise
of Pambula, in the light of results, won’t make him any
happier by and bye.
« * #
Rockvale, in N.S.W., has had its first crushing.
Expected upwards of an oz.; got 7dwts. Two months ago
we predicted gdwts., so even geologist Curran’s pessi-
mistic “ wild-oat man ” has hit over the mark. But the
mine should pay well at that, should the rate be main-
tained, under its canny manager, who has a big lode and
a big plant. But these are “early days.”
# # *
S.M. Herald now says that the last yield from
Nambucca Heads (N.S.VV.) mine was from inferior ore.
What! After the report that “ eight to ten ozs. is being
put through the chlorinating barrels!” Result? Some
200ozs. from 70 tons—not bad, had the public not been led
to expect three times as much. But what’s the matter
with the mine—why do its shares go down ?
* * *
Harry Newman, the member for Orange. N. S. W.,
is making them sit up with his crushings' from the
Aladdin’s Lamp,” at Lucknow. He has turned out, by
means of a 10-head mill, which is continually breaking
down, £20,000 worth of gold in two months, and the
crushing now running through looks like another 20000 z-
. in a couple of weeks’ time. The history of the old
Reform, adjoining, makes it hard to believe that the
richness of the Aladdin’s Lamp is not short-lived.
# • tt
The M ‘Arthur-Forrest patentees contemplate
the erection of a custom mill, in N.S.W., for the treat-
ment of ores by the cyanide of potassium process. By
the way, the right of this patent is being opposed in
’Frisco, and we believe that it is also openly defied by some
Maoriland mining-highwaymen.

The Argenton Smelters, which were going to
revive the Tasmanian silver-field, are, after a short run,
now closed down.

So far, this year’s Bendigo dividends exceed
calls by over £50,000. The New Chum United is at the
head of the cake list, its last being 1726 ozs. for a fort-
night’s crushing. The distinguishing feature of the mine
is the fact that its gold is got below the 2000-foot level,
probably the richest gold got at that depth in the world.
The other good fortnightly-cake claims are Johnson’s
Reef, Princess Dagmar, Hustler’s Reef, United Hustler’s,
Specimen Hill, New Argus, Catherine Reef, Great
Extended Hustler’s, and Garden Gully United. What
grand gold-producing claims the last two have been!
Each has turned out tons of gold, and it is said that at
one period of the Garden Gully United’s existence the
lode was so well opened-up at different levels with con-
necting winzes that there were six to seven tons of gold
actually in sight.

The Court will be asked to approve of the
liquidation arrangements concerning the wound-up Mer-
cantile Bank of Sydney on 15th inst. Opposition is
expected from angry shareholders, who intend to demand
public scrutiny and strict investigation before judicial
sanction covers up this piece of business.

The existence of the Sunlight gold-mine
(N.S.W.)is endangered—weighed down by a 10 per cent,
royalty. At its recent meeting handsome directors’ fees
were excused on the ground of good management. Here
is evidence of mismanagement. First an inefficient
serial wire tramway for the conveyance of ore to the
battery. For the last two years, thousands of tons of
firewood have been lowered and thrown down the gorge ;
now they have what they should have had at first, a cable-
tramway, the cost of which would have long ago been
saved. Many thousands of tons of ore, containing a fair
percentage of valuable mineral, have been crushed and
the bulk of the pyrites allowed to run away with the
tailings. Now, when the ore has by no means increased
in value, it is proposed to erect a concentrating plant.
And this is called good management ? Without a reduc-
tion of royalty the mine will soon fall into the hands of
the holders of the freehold. Good management seemingly
commenced with the decline of the good ore.
* * *
The published tonnage of N.S.W. crushings is a
delusion and a snare. To call 150 tons 100 can serve no
purpose but to deceive, and this dodge has been prac-
tised to such an extent that the game is no longer worth
playing. We have in our “mind’s eye” a 40-head
battery in the province which only crushes 450 to 460 tons
a fortnight, and smaller ones which turn out a pro-
portionately smaller amount. A 40-head battery, even of
the light description alluded to, should crush at least 600
tons in the time. The 40-head battery used in Bendigo
would crush over 800 loads, and the Bendigo load is
a thumpingly big ton. Why not call them “loads” as
in Bendigo? The “tons” are never weighed, and loads
would at least be a more respectable form of lying.
* * *
in a mine, above any other thing, that great ass,
the public, scattered over Australia with small parcels of
shares, is the victim of the few with big bundles of scrip
who watch, wait and quietly “ scoot.”
* * *
Sydney D.T., of a Tuena mine : “It goes sozs,
to the ton, crushed in a battery badly out of form, having
no gold-saving appliances.” Bah ! “Five ounces and no
gold-saving appliances !” What do they want ? If no gold-
saving appliances, why don’t they get them ? The fact is
that at Tuena the rich gold is so rough that the com-
monest battery will save it.
* * *
After crushing 50 tons of lOoz. stone the Mount
Allen ten-head battery has closed down. Alleged cause-
want of water. They could have had very little to start
with, and it will always be a desideratum in that drought-
stricken country. Dry-crushing should suit them better.
It is fine gold in red oxide, and, if the statements made in
the report are correct, the claim is a very good thing.

views as to the manner in which a cheque should be
drawn in favour of the building society of which he was

offered a crossed cheque made payable to the society’s
order. He insisted that a cheque so drawn was in-
controvertible proof of the drawer’s blind ignorance of
banking habits. A cheque intended for his society should
not be made payable to its order, as it involved its
endorsement by the guinea-pigs, but should be an open

BUSHRANGING & OUTLAWRY
IN AUSTRALASIA.
(FOR THE BULLETIN .)
BY PRICE WARUNG.
The bushranger of Australia is now widely
regarded as an extinct type of criminal. Although
Andrew Bent, the father of the Tasmanian press,
had, in 1818, said precisely the same thing of Mike
Hcvve, Nod Kelly has been pronounced “the last
of the bushrangers” by the late Mr. Hare—the
most recent historian of the freebooters. That
officer, not content with commanding the party
which destroyed the Kelly Gang, added a new
deterrent to lawlessness by writing an account of
those exponents of the science and art of bush-
ranging. lie therein expressed the conclusion
that the culmination of his own police career was
the climax of Australian outlawry. To the hero
of the achievement telling his own story a con-
clusion such as this may perhaps be allowed, but
to other persons it is by no means clear that the
bushranger died out with a period which the
elders of the present generation already look upon
as historic.
* * *
For many a long year to come the Aus-
tralian interior will present in its fringe of settle-
ment similar conditions to those which nurtured
freebooters such as Gardiner, “ Moonlite ” (or
“ Moonlight ’) Scott, Hall, and the Kellys within
the memory of men still young. While there
remains a mountain or gully fastness which a
“bush-telegraph” can ready though the electric
wire does not pass it—a sly-grog shanty where
the outlaw is made welcome while the mounted
trooper on his track runs the risk of being
“hocussed” or knocked on the head—a “duffing-
ken,” or a yard where an occasional “ clear ” skin
and unbranded two-year-old can he run in without
exciting more notice than an incurious wink —there
will exist the breeding-place and the habitat of the
bushrangers. And as for that species of criminal
himself, it is surely a reckless assertion to
assert that he has passed absolutely into the
regions of history, or (what is perhaps the same
thing) of myth, when a day’s journey “up-
eountry ” from any Australian capital will bring
the city man into contact with scores of the rock-
less-spirited and keen-witted, but morbidly-tem-
pered and illiterate, native buslimen. The toss of
a coin any day would, if the thought seized him,
transform many a boundary-rider, shearer, or
fencer into a “ knight of the road.”
* * *
What, to such a one, would he the alarum
N conscience—the sure retribution of the law ?
What to him the shriek of offended society?
Nothing ! The very chase by the troopers would
give him a fresh zest, and the cries of the press
and the public be but so many plaudits. He
would enjoy his smoke the more for lighting his
fiipe with the official proclamation of his crime,
which offers are ward for his head, instead of with the
“ settlers’ matches ” on the same tree-trunk. What
if the life were but short ? It would bo at least
merry, and a thousand times better than the
whim-horse round of station or free-selection toil.
Thus may think, thus has thought, many a fellow,
lithe of limb, lean of flank, silent of tongue,
when trying in his ignorant fashion to adjust
himself to his surroundings—to the brooding
monotony of the treeless plains and the
“sullen despair” that haunts the timbered
ranges, to the half-starved selection existence
or the scarcely less dreary township life, “inside”
and “way back.” The outlaw’s career would be
free for a time, so might the bushman think. It
might continue for a month or two, or it might
last for a year or two—but what odds? He
doesn’t know his Scott —the only Scott he has
heard of is “ Wantabadgery Moonlight,” else he
would quote to himself
Sound the trumpet, fill the fife !
To all the sensual world proclaim.
Better an hour of glorious life
Than an age without a name !
For that is his inarticulate thought. In his
mind’s eye lie sees the “name,” but not the infamy
attaching to it. “It was living while it lasted
and people won’t forget me !” said Harry Power
to a warder in Melbourne gaol; and a similar
remark was made by old Martin Cash to the pre-
sent writer long after the old ’ranger had settled
down into law-abidingness and respectability.
“ It warn’t half bad,” Cash said, with a faint
regret in his voice, gazing reflectively as he spoke
towards the cloud-veiled summit of Mount Wel-
lington—lie was standing on the footway of a
Glenorehy (Tas.) street. _ “Not half-bad !”
“But were you not in constant dread of the
police—of the law ?”
“ Well, what if I was? That was on’y the salt
in th’ soup. An’ we was makin’ names for our-
selves !”
»
The element of danger and the “ reputa-
tion ” of his party were the spice of the old man’s
daily food. And they relieved for him and his
comrades the tastelessness of existence. The grim
characteristics of the Australian bush fetter to-
day spirits as untamed as Cash’s and minds as
uncultivated as his, which may _ break at any
moment the invisible bonds of their environment
as impetuously and with as great contempt for
legal and moral consequences as ever a Van
Demonian or a Black Norfolker did double-clinks
or “ trumpeter ’’-irons. Tempers of that kind are
not to be brought into line with civilisation by
police regulations. Penal laws will do little _to
correct that hatred of monotony and that craving
for distinction of some sort which ignoble souls
share with others of a nobler order. And if the
bushranger is to become as extinct as his fore-
runner of Sherwood Forest and Hounslow Heath
it will not be the mounted-constable or the black-
tracker that is to run him to earth. It will be the
State-schoolmaster and the compositor. Hie
leaden type of the latter will prove more efficacious
than the policeman’s bullet. And a “half-time ”
teacher as lie plods from one wretched little
“portable” school to_ another is the strongest
a°*ent of Australian civilisation, and will make
the sticker-up of coaches and townships, robber of
mails and escorts impossible. When the Ned
Kelly of the future desires to rob a bank he will
not adopt the crude, inartistic methods of his
bush prototype, but will follow the plans oi a bell
and Davies, or of a G. N. Taylor,
# • •
If, then, the Australian provinces ever
witness another outburst of bushranging, it will
be because the current conditions of out-settlement
existence press heavily in some way or other upon
the men who will then take their lives in their
hands, or because they are the victims of a delusion
as to the way their deeds are likely to impress the
popular imagination. The history of this peculiar
form of lawlessness, when carefully analysed,
shows us the like facts at the root of the actions
of its successive followers. A greed for others’
property has not been invariably the cause of a
man or a gang taking to the roads. Hunger,
poverty, tyranny, the seeming injustice of the
position to which they had been called, or into
which they have been thrown, account for most of
the seven hundred bushrangers, of which we have
particulars, setting the law at defiance ; in many
more, an ill-regulated ambition, an inordinate
vanity, or the notion that the career of the adven-
turer was one of freedom and glory, drove them
to crime; in some few instances, a craving for
revenge operated to create these Ishmaels where
any other motive would have proved powerless ;
but in fewer still does the plain reason for a
resort to the.“ bail-up ” tis a means of “honest
livelihood” —the phrase is Bushranger Codys
appear to have been the greed of goods and money
belonging to others. Heterodox as the conclusion
may sound, we fear that a passionless survey of
the doings of the Claude Duvals, the Dick Turpins
and the Blueskins of Australia, would discover
rarer instances of selfish cupidity than the careers
of a like number of bank directors. The cases
which are authentically known where our free-
booters have literally distributed the proceeds of
their robberies among their allies —and he was but
a ’prentice hand at the trade whose friends and
accessories were not comparatively numerous —are
countless, and the circumstances which marked
the gifts do not invariably suggest that they were
always made from policy and as bribes.
* * *
There is, of course, no merit in such deeds,
though not infrequently in other orders of society
the gentleman who is liberal with the property of
others is rapturously applauded. Their occur-
rence proves, however, that the ’rangers were not
in every case removed from the reach of human
feeling. Brady, the notorious Van Demonian,
shot one of his gang because he had retained for
himself a portion of money which he-had been
directed to place in the hut of a poor woman—the
widow of a ‘‘free”settler — whom he(Brady)desired
to befriend without her knowledge. Brady, sus-
pecting his messenger, ordered him to be searched,
and the identical Spanish dollars which he had
handed to the man being found in bis, waist-belt,
the follow was then and there shot by his chief.
“ He who’ll rob a widow woman will soli us to
the Fielders! ” remarked Brady, and while the
murder may have been committed because of the
fear that the gang’s betrayal to Ihe Field Police
might be consummated by the victim, the incident
strikes us rather as showing how curiously
the high attributes of generosity and sympathy
mav blend in the same nature with murderous and
thievislf instincts. Nor, viewed in th s light does
it stand alone. The ’ranger is indeed a pariah
among the pariahs of whom some such story is
not circumstantially related. At Kingower, near
Inglewood (Vic.), a deed of kindness is narrated
we shall relate it in its proper place—of which
the undoubted doer was Sullivan, of Maungatapu,
the twenty-fold murderer. If such a monster
could, without hope of gain, perform an act which
would have added fresh grace to a Sister of
Charity’s record, one may not altogether discredit
the stories of unforced generosity told of Howe,
of M‘Cabe, of O’Meally, of the Clarkes, of Ben
Hall, of Ned Kelly. The gains of our bandits
were ill-got, but they were not invariably ill-
spent. For several years a certain Tasmanian
Benevolent Society received an annual anony-
mous subscription through the hands of the late
J. W. Gleadow, the well-known Launceston
solicitor. It ceased on the death of one of his
clients, and it was only through that event that
the fine old Methodist lawyer discovered that he
had been paying to the cause of charity the interest
on a capital sum obtained by a course of “stickmg-
up.”
# # *
Not every “gentleman of the road,” how-
ever, was moved to apply to colonial society
Sydney Smith’s famous formula of philanthropy,
which suggests to A that he should relieve the
distress of B by devoting to his succour the
contents of C’s pocket. Among the more
notorious rogues Dunne, the Van Demonian, (not
the marauder, Dunn, whom Gardiner led to Ins
ruin), Morgan (the one who fell in Victoria, and
not the South Australian of the same name), and
Gardiner, the New South Welshman, Cannot bask
in even a borrowed halo of generosity. The genius
of romance, which does not disdain to touch with
some softening tinge of colour the harsh and sordid
features of other eminent rascals, averts her pencil
from these scoundrels. They robbed or they
murdered for themselves alone, and if their tools
or assistants shared in the proceeds of their crimes,
the “chief” never failed to distinguish himself by
rapacity and greed. Had Morgan kept faith with
one of his “telegraphs,” it is doubtful whether
Quinlan’s bullet would have found its billet in
that ruffian’s back on that fatal April morning in
1805. And the people who viewed Gardiner’s
career with leniency, and favoured his release,
never went so far as to urge in his favour that (to
quote the freebooting sliibbo’etli) “lie bad only
taken from the rich to give to the poor.” That
redeeming symptom of .humanity was totally
wanting in his case. He was the robber without
the one element which keeps the robber human.
The sense of brotherhood with those who, whether
mistaken or not, aided him —with those who,
impelled by a distorted chivalry, refused to earn
blood-money by giving him to the authorities
with those who wire suffering worse than himself
from poveity or sickness—was absolutely lacking
in Francis Gardiner, otherwise Christie. Ho
robbed because he was a thief. Why, being what
be was, ho was chosen for a peculiar exercise of
the prerogative of mercy, will be told here 0 r ter—•
for the first time, truly.
* * *
Gardiner, the most notorious of the last
generation of N.S'. Wales banditti, robbed for the
sake of what he could obtain. So robbed the
earliest of Australian bushrangers, but under cir-
cumstances vastly different. For them we, per-
haps, at this day, may find some little excuse.
Bushranging, virtually, is coeval with Australia.
It was not indeed until the first years of the pre-
sent century that gangs were organised for the
purpose of systematic depredation. In almost
everything that has been previously written on
this‘subject, Michael Howe is regarded as intro-
ducing the epoch of freebooting, but several
years before Howe plagued Colonel Davey, the
Lieut.-Governor of V.D.L.. into getting drunk
nightly in order that he might forget that he had
at least one subject who laughed at him, the
term “ bushranging ” had come into specific use in
the “ old colony ” to describe the men who had

Writes in the Journal of Cutaneous Medicine :
“ The use of a good soap is certainly calculated
to preserve the skin in health, to maintain its
complexion and tone, and prevent its falling into
wrinkles . . . PEARS is a name engraven on
the memory of the oldest inhabitant; and Pears’
Transparent Soap is an article of the nicest and
most careful manufacture, and one of the most
refreshing and agreeable of balms for the skin.”

taken “ to the woods ” with designs of plunder.
And the fact itself was of still earlier origin. The
first men “to take to the woods”—this was the
expressive phrase with which the early chroniclers
were wont to quaintly define the fact—did so in
obedience to an official mandate. They were
banished there as a consequence of an order of
exile issued by Governor Phillip.
There is generally some hitch about that
purse of sovereigns which is subscribed in a one-
hdrse township for presentation to the leading
citizen who is going away. A solemn tgle is still
told in a certain Maoriland city concerning an
inflated person of ho particular note, who many
years ago received a banquet and a sum of ,£100
from a few admiring friends just prior to his
departure—or rather his intended departure—for
regions unknown. In this case the guest put up
the Whole £100 himself arid stood all the experises
of the banquet, and paid £5 to the man
who made the beautiful arid affecting speech
about the sorrow of the community ovet
its impending loss. He did this because .the
man was a prosaic journalist, and said he’d be
dashed, or something of that sort, if he wasted, his
time over the job without adequate remuneration.
Then the guest rose and accepted his Own moriey
back again with a trembling hand, and a teat
glistening in his eye and threatening to run down
the back of his head —for he had asquint* and
standing amid the ruins of his own victuals and
his own dead marines he told them how his heart
was too full for utterance. Later on he counted
the money and found that there was £5 short, so
he took the journalist on one side and asked
savagely where it had gone to, and the pressman
called him a hog, and told him that if he said
any more he would give the whole scheme
away on the spot. The rest of the evening was
spent in conviviality, and finally the crowd
separated—after singing, “ He’s a jolly good
fellow” —and the guest of the evening was arrested
outside the door, and got 12 months for embezzle-
ment. He could have got away three weeks
before if he hadn’t waited for the presentation.
The testimonial was taken off him at the lockup,
and his creditors annexed it later on. The other
day another social function of the same sort came
to grief in a Maoriland town not many miles from
the scene of the afore-mentioned disaster. The
testimonial, in this case, was genuine enough, but
by some unspeakably bad luck the local hotel-
keeper was appointed treasurer to the fund, and
was also entrusted with the duty of making the
speech of the evening, and handing over the purse.
He made the speech all right. He told the
audience that the gentleman sitting at the end of
the table was about to depart, and when he was
gone they would all feel his loss more than words
could express. Therefore his many friends had
raised a small subscription as a very inadequate
expression of their good will towards that gentle-
man, and—here his voice was broken with genuine
emotion —he had collared the amount to liquidate
the gentleman’s bill for drinks at his establish-
ment, therefore the gentleman could now depart
with a clean sheet and the respect of all who
knew him. Then he sat down, and the horrible
silence that ensued could have been heard seven
miles away.

An Adelaide councillor, who is also a
butcher, arid another magnate of that city
recently took a journey to England in the saloon
of one of the big steamers. They were dissatisfied
with the fare and cpnstantly called for pea-soup.
At length the steward said, “ Oh, I’ve remem-
bered you to-day, and there is your favourite dish
on the table. Here follows the story of the coun-
cillor :— “ We both had a go in at the soup, which
was right up to the knocker. When our plates
was clean, I says : ‘ Stooard, let’s hev some more
pea-soup.’ ‘It ain’t ettiketty,’ says the stooard,
‘to hpv two lielpins o’ soup.’ ‘Oh, damn your
ettiketty,’ I pys, ‘let’s have the soup.’ He
goes along to the captain, and the captain
he says : ‘ Oh, .here, stooard, take ’em the
tooreen.’ He thought he’d choke us off but
when the stooard come back, I says, ‘Now,
stick it down there !’ Then I says to L ,
‘Now, then, old chap, wire in ;’ and I tell you we
did wire iri, and We empties the tooreen. That
was the orily square meal we had on the voyage.
They whs precious liberal with their mulligit-
hornys arid their other Frenchified stuff, but only
one lot o’ peasoup did they give us, and then it
cost us the devil in tips.”
Humoured in Maoriland that the Ballance
Government is trying to devise some arrangement
whereby the Legislative Council will be allowed
to die of slow decay. If the Liberal party can hold
office long enough, and if it enters into a solemn
compact to make no new nominations under any
possible circumstances, then it can sit down and
wait till the last Councillor goes to maunder in
Paradise, and after that the Constitution can be
fixed up on a new basis. The most solemn part of
the business would be the long, dreary waiting
for the Last Man to peg out. There is nothing on
earth so tough as the last man, unless it be
the oldest inhabitant, and in all probability
that lone, lorn, doddering politician would
meet night after night for many years to
pass bills and applaud all by himself in
the great, hollow-sounding chamber, and wouM
resolutely refuse to pass an Act for his own aboli-
tion so long as he could sit up in his perambulator
and object. There would have to be some
arrangement, too, about a quorum, but that could
be easily managed. In the British House of
Lords one little Johnnie who is married to a
dancing-girl is all the quorum they want—just one
stupid little peer with a cigarette thumb—and
then the House is ready to tackle the biggest pro-
blem that can be put before it. And we wouldn’t
like to swear that the system isn’t a good one ;
the average nominee chamber is so ineffably stupid
that it isn’t worth worrying about quorums—the
more of it that stays away the better.
Truth is straticer than fiction—sometimes
Xiucn is scitingei tiiciii ncyioii soiiioiiiiies,
and this true story proves it. The scene was in a
Sydney bar, where a frowsy Scotchman and an
equally frowsy Italian were holding each other
up with difficulty and having drinks. They were
. 1 .. i j £ , i
m the affectionate stage of intoxication, and "ere
trying to sing each other’s national hymns with
limited success. A particularly dirty Welshman,
who was drunk and stone-broke, hovered in the
rear in the hope that somebody would “ shout,”
but no one took anv notice of him. When the
Scotchman and the Italian finally broke down in
their national anthems he offered, in desperation,
to sing them a Welsh song for a shilling* The
offer was promptly declined. Then he offered to
fight the Scotchman and the Italian for sixpence,
anti that offer was also declined. Finally t
climbed up on the counter, and started to hrm.’i i.
Welsh melody gratis. When lie got to about tl
fourth line, the barmaid stopped to stare athini v'H
a look of sudden recognition,. “ Who arc you ?”")
said abruptly, “and where do you come from,®
The songster explained with difficulty that V
name was—hie—Griffiths, and he came froth S o
place that sounded like the upsetting of a c 'T
load of crockery. Then the girl gave a sh t'
hysterical laugh, and remarked that she reall
believed it was her old father turned 1 up at ]*
The newly-found parent slid down off the count >
and at once proceeded to improve the occasion 'T’
demanding the loan of half-a-crown. His daugl t?
responded, in effect, that she would see
first, rind told hitn to go back where he had bo-*
for the last seven years. The Scotchman hern
stood a long beer to keep the returned fatlm
from fainting, and after he had drunk it, he starte j
to mumble in a corner about the grievofisness r(
having a thankless child. Then he fell asleep ail !i
by-and-bye he was thrown out hy his daughter*,
orders, and when he got outside a policeman fel
upon him, and took him away.

lished Church
Still in Essex as I write these lines ; and yet more dis
tressed than ever at witnessing the awful nakedness of the
land ; more unhappy than before at the thought of the
doom now fast culminating upon my miserable’country
To-day I have walked mile after mile through a district
yet unknown to me, and always the same sad, sad tale I
rub my eyes and ask, am I in Connemara or Ae'hill
Island?' But no; every gate almost, every finger-post
perhaps, but certainly every farmhouse, or every other
farmhouse, attests the fact that I am in the centre of a
“busted community;” and this in a district noted as
one of the richest in England before bad government and
priestcraft stifled it to death. Why do I say “ farm-
house ? ” Simply because the barns, or gables or
posts, or what nots, almost invariably carry
posters, old or new, showing that the land or
farming implements are in the hands of the sheriff—that
even the growing crops have been seized, and have been
or will be, sold for the benefit of one cormorant or
another. It is simply heartrending to read these notices
as it is to listen to the tales of the occasional—very
occasional—individual who can tell me what I want to
know. My authorities to-day are a cart driver or two—
not of farm produce, but of bricks and mortar—the land-
lady of an inn where I get a bit of bread and cheese.
Useless trying to “ haver ” with a labourer ! There are
none !! I trudge mile after mile along the main road
ankle deep in mud and filth, and I say to myself, “This’
then, is where the rottenness and corruption now existing
is first showing its cloven hoof.” It is evident the rates
and taxes cannot now pay for road cleaning ! Yet I am
in England, within 43 miles of London, and nearing the
twentieth century!! I trudge along, I say—not once
during the livelong day have I seen one sheep, or one
beast, or one agricultural labourer. Scarcely a
farm in cultivation, some “ gone back ” a year,
some, 1 should saj 7 , ten years. Yet the land, although a
little clayey, is as good land as exists in the world—and I
will give way to few people as to a knowledge of farming,
a pursuit I followed for years. Nay, I will go further, and
say that were this very land in the Western States of
America—5000 miles away—it would fetch tar more than
here. It is killed with the church tithe. Field after field
untilled, house after house fallen or falling to pieces.
Farms that afforded existence and happiness to genera-
tion after generation, all tumbling to pieces; and as to
cottages, many of the roofs (even when t hey are inhabited)
are open to the daylight. Ah, God ! can such things be?
