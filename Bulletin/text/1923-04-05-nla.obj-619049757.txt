The Red Page
The Latest School of Fiction
There are forebodings of change in the
English novel. Wells, Walpole, Compton
Mackenzie, Cannan and W. L. George, who
are patently conscious of having made Trol-
lope, Dickens and Thackeray old-fashioned,
are beginning to be themselves outmoded by
a new school of introspectionists which
adventures in psycho-analysis, while afflicted
with a cheerless, radical frankness regard-
ing the state of Sex and the Soul. We
have evidence of the new trend in D. H.
Lawrence, an artist in the use of luxuriant
English, but frequently weakened in achieve-
ment by dim incoherencies and superotic
questionings. The trouble with Lawrence is
that he allows a first-class, but peculiarly
feminine, imagination to subtilise and exalt
the common facts of emotion. To him inter-
course between man and woman is matter
for a book in a lyric tone of conjecture,
when a real man, strong in the normal mas-
culine distaste for rhapsodising on a natural
and often humiliating experience, would
hardly consider the business worthy of a
paragraph. One is not conscious of any moral
attitude in calling Lawrence disgusting.
What is so painful is his supreme subor-
dination of his sex to the covetous inti-
macies and degrading enchantments of the
average amorous female. Granville Barker
stressed this point in “Waste,” but English
sentimentality, educated on the musty roman-
ticism of “Camille,” was so deeply shocked
by the suggestion that a light-of-love was a
warping and ruinous influence on a talented
man, that Barker’s fine play has been for-
gotten, while the Lawrences and other profit-
eers in the contrary doctrine are mentioned
by thousands of maudlin admirers with tears
in the voice.
Lawrence, however, is unquestionably a
brilliant craftsman, and one may hazard
the conclusion that the novel as literature is
safe with him. But what is one to say of the
Dorothy Richardsons and Waldo Franks,
with whom literature is not so much safe as
it is sound—with a good deal of it signify-
ing nothing? Dorothy Richardson has
recorded in “Interim” and ether shapeless
books of the same tenor and substance the
maundering speculations of a girl named
Miriam whose outlook on life is poured out
in a cataract of broken-backed phrases and
decapitated sentences —the whole maintained
in a gusty staccato form by prolific use of
hyphens, colons and notes of exclamation,
if you are heroic enough to follow Miriam
through one volume you gather that she
is an intensely virginal spinster whose hatred
of Man, if expressed in real life, would have
a deep and abiding interest for the Freudian
philosopher. When Miriam shouts “What
is Man?” and Echo (alias Miriam) tartly
answers that he is a load of macadam, a
piece of banana-skin, a bit of Gruyfere in a
violet bed, or some other unimaginable silli-
ness, you begin to suspect that a neglected
maiden lady has found a cemetery for hen
disappointments in literary duplicities. The
feature of Miriam to the student, therefore,
is a revelation of the sex complex which
the American critic George Jean Nathan as-
tutely diagnosed when it was more spectacu-
larly illustrated in the posturings of
“classic” dancers. Speaking plainly, Miriam
is not so much engaged in imparting her
emotional aloofness in terms of literature as
in displaying her eagerness to make a date
for the front parlor with the lights turned
out. That sums up Miriam in all her out-
pourings, and the phenomenon is not' unfa-
miliar to'us in our daily round. But before
leaving her it is worth noting as a side-
issue that if, womanlike, she cannot have
the last word, she is at least determined
to have the latest. One finds her referring
to a “blatter of sounds,” and she scores an
onamatopoeic bull’s-eye with the expression,
“she scrooped her chair over the tiles.”
Waldo Frank, who is extraordinary proof
of America’s slow emergence from the
commonplaceness of the Best Seller, is a
writer whose four or five books have stirred
the alumni of literary reviews to delirious
admiration or hectic contempt. It may be
said that his manner is no manner at all.,
And his style is smothered in vagueness
until the thought dies screaming in a mesh
of mystifications. Take his “City Block,” a
bookful of studies of American character,
and when one is groping for a story which
seems exasperatingly near and intelligible,
one stumbles over things like this: —
Dominant the bed. Under the arrogant vibrance
of its quilt lived depths. Depths quiet.
Or this: —
Lathran was in chaos. Two forces flung him.
Sinking autumn and high spring. Each barred the
full of the other. Chaos. .. .Janet reads.
Or this:—
Both of them were silent. They sat there, oppo-
site each other on the stoop, confronted, apart. Their
eyes did not meet. They felt each other’s eyes not
going to meet. Men, women, passed between them
going up and down the house that stood above
them very high. Its largeness was made of myriad
little questions.
Waldo Frank ? s sexual illusions reach a
high temper in this book, but his particulari-
sation of the aspects of feminine loveliness
is robbed of any pornographic intent by the
queerest little poetic proprieties, often peeping
in a devastating flow of candor. Yet a man
with a vaunted ear for euphonious language
consistently uses the shattering “belly.” The
same term, which he obviously employs as
a woodening brutality after posing for pages
in a rapturous attitude, is just as,conspicu-
ous in his novel “Rahab.” This story is
more memorable than “City Block,” because
it is alive with unexpected reticences in the
affairs of two or three established courtesans
and their amiable, if unimpressive, protec-
tors. Fanny Luve is the chief figure, and
she looms up, after one half-hearted adven-
ture, a sweet and demure saint, unaffected
by the libertinism and' minor frailties of a
low-grade New York existence. Waldo
Frank has accomplished something in
“Rahab,” and his work is not without merit
in “The Dark Mother” and “Our America,”
but he seems always frustrated by a desire to
make plain things obscure in a desperate
rabble of words.
C. R. BRADISH.
Art and Nationality
It does one good to find Wallace Nelson
with courage enough to hint at the truth
about Nationality and Art (R.P. l/3/’23).
One agrees with him in the main just as
cordially as one disagrees with Mr. Esson.
Yet one differs from Mr. Nelson profoundly
as to his dictum that nations have no per-
sonality, and so forth. I am no savant,
thank the Lord; but I have read enough
regarding the psychology of crowds to teach
me better than that. Into that great morass
of dubiety and speculation I shall not
wander.
My point is that the fetich of Natmnality
is just as bad and damned a thing in Art
as in Affairs. There is nothing more harm-
ful than the prevalent idea that anything
written in Australia must be good if it is
extravagantly local or topical. Because of
that idea, or by benefit of it,'some Australian
writers have won absurdly inflated reputa-
tions—in Australia. A man may write of
Australian subjects and blow an Australian
trumpet all his days, and still remain a
shockingly bad writer. Robert Burns was a
poet of singular merit who happened to be
born a Scottish peasant. Is it not likely
that he would have won quite as great repute
as poet had he happened to be born in
France or the Low Countries? We don’t
think of Shakspeare particularly as an
Englishman, not ffken now that a Mr.
Looney has aptly declared the bard to have
been none other than a debauched fop and
courtling. Nor are we in the least distressed
by the fact that Spinoza (like the greatly
unpopular and unfashionable Jesus of
Nazareth) was a Jew. Art, like true great-
ness, has no nationality. Nor has philosophy.
I am forced to the conclusion that most
of this talk about the proud nationhood of
Australians is bosh. The Australian is
generally too casual to have any reasoned
pride in anything, and pride without reason
is the grossest foolishness. Do you think
that any people with a true pride of citizen-
ship would calmly tolerate such an out-
rageous scandal as the Sydney telephone-
service, to take one example? Do you think
that people proud of their citizenship would
clamor constantly for stuff and stuffers
imported from oversea, as Australians do?
Can you conceive that a reasonably proud
people would tamely submit to the continu-
ing desecration of the shores of Port Jack-
son? I have met a number of fellows howl-
ing about Australia for the Australians, and
I never wanted to meet any of them twice;
not because I don’t admire patriotic fervor
and passionate national pride in a man, but
because I know that this ' laboriously
whipped-up Australian sentiment is a cheap
and paltry thing that does little credit to
anybody. When it is brought into litera-
ture, it becomes the very devil. Show me
a great composer, and I don’t care whether
he is English (invariably he isn’t), Abys-
sinian, Celt or Eskimo. Show me a great
writer, and I don’t care whether he
comes from Birmingham, Invercargill
or Rekjavik. No art can expand
and grow in a narrow cage of national
prejudice. That is why the average loud-
mouthed, flag-wagging, hag-ridden American
is such a poor nut. He boosts his country
incessantly, he boosts everything that breeds
and broods and flares and festers in his
country; he is the hapless victim of this
national fever, and he jabbers insanely with
the delirium of it.
What we need in Australia now is not
national sentiment but communal common-
sense. We badly need such an awakening
conscience in our people as shall lead them
to see that 5,000,000 settlers have no right
to hold a continent, as things go. We want
men and women with wit enough to see that
the only way to keep Australia white is to
bring into it year by year more and more
happy and vigorous white people. This
amazing virtue of being an Australian de-
scends on anybody who lives in Australia
five or ten years. Bring in 100,000
Swedes or Anatolians to-morrow, and
in ten years you should have, maybe,
300,000 good Australians, waving flags and
yelping nationality’s wild tosh with the best
of you.
I should love above all things to be a
member of an Australian community evolved
in this way. I should like to have a French-
man as my neighbor on one side, and an
Italian as my neighbor on the other, with a
Scot and an Irishman across the way, and
a Dutchman and an educated Russian round
the corner. Then there might be a married
American or two, and I should raise no pro-
test against a German —I never have liked
Germans, but I know that in their way they
are hospitable and tolerant and kind, and that
they make good enough neighbors. Scattered
among all these, I should like a few good
Australians of this generation, with one or
two Maorilanders and a few English families
of the right sort. I wouldn’t break the peace
to keep out another Scotsman. If there
ever was a man of peace, I’m one. I
should like the children of these people to
go and get a sound education at a common
school, so that the boys would marry the
girls when they grew up, if the girls felt
like it. If a few of the boys didn’t feel
like it, I should be glad to see them travel
away and bring back wives from all the
broad earth-—one fellow one wife, of
course. And I should have all the children
taught to beware of national prejudice;
national prejudice is hell, the hell that at
this time half the world is pitiably trying
to climb out of. National boundaries are
the ineffective fences of the varied hells
that national prejudice keeps hot.
As for literature, I know that the pretty
footle we talk about this sort of literature
and that sort of literature is—footle. I
know that much of the New Irish literature
in which my most melodious good friend
David McKee Wright rejoices is only Irish
by a trick of the pen, and that much of it
isn’t worth a damn. I know that great
literature is great in its own country and
in all countries, and is independent of
national prejudice in any country.
Australia is for the world, or Australia
is nothing. Barriers should not be erected
between nations, but between races they
should tower as high as the stars. Every

good Jew knows that, just as certainly as
every good Chinese knows it. China is for
one race, and Great Britain and the white
dominions of Britain are for another race.
Different races cannot live in masses
together without disaster to both. That is
one of the few things that experience so
far has taught America.
You may say that I am not qualified to
write on this subject, not being an Austra-
lian. I have only been in and about Aus-
tralia 40 years, and confess without tears
that I am an Englishman. But I love
Australia better than I have ever loved
England. I love some Australian writers
better than the average Australian loves
them; only, not being Australian, I can
discriminate. Some of the Australian writers
I love are no more Australian than I am,
David McKee Wright for one. Wallace
Nelson is in a class by himself. I think
he is the only Scotsman I ever truly loved
at all. I love him so well that I hate to
differ from him even in such a matter as
the psychology of crowds.
FRANK MORTON.
London in War-time
During the last 10 years there has been
a vast drop in the moral barometer of
the Old Country. At the beginning
of the period everybody was making
too much money—with the inevitable
consequences. When the war came almost
everyone lived on the principle, “Let us eat
and drink,.,'for to-morrow we die.” When
the war was over there was no change for
the better; and there followed a howl from
the old-time novelists—those who published
the successful books of a dozen years ago—
saying }Jiat they are starving and that no-
body will read their books any more. The
new novel must have plenty of “pep” (we
thank thee, Uncle, for teaching us that
word). A most respectable firm of pub-
lishers (Chapman and Hall, the Dickens ex-
ploiters) boldly advertise the tales of Boc-
caccio at a price well within the reach of a
schoolboy’s pocket. Rabelais’s roguishness
is obtainable dirt-cheap, and inimitably
translated. _ The adventures of Casanova
can be obtained either in the costliest bind-
ing or at rates more suited to thin purses.
The modern novelist who wants to make
money has discovered that he must run his
books out on lines remembering these great
men.
Here is one who may be forgiven much,
for he is a foreigner—probably Armenian—
and he has a wit which lends point to his
descriptions. His name is Michael Arlen.
He appears to have been brought up in Eng-
land, and his earliest books got him much
of the joy of being “talked about.” In those
books there were irritating modes of ex-
pression. Now, in his third or fourth, he
has overcome them all, except one, which
consists of insanity of punctuation. The
tale is called Piracy (Collins), and gives a
wonderfully fresh and vigorous story of the
inner life of London in the time of the war.
I have dipped into many war novels, and
do_ not remember any one which came near
this. He says: “All of the persons in this
book, except Mr. Fletcher and Mr. Trevor,
are entirely of the imagination,” but it is
hard to believe him. Arlen has, at any
rate, the power of depicting characters very
like living people. Take, for example, the
Greek millionaire who held many tons of
money, with which he played with the little
nations who quarrelled and yelped at his
heels; the penniless Irish peer, who runs
away with the. actress he cares nothing for,
and yet, in his fashion, loves the heroine
(God save the mark!) of the novel; the
many sudden flashes of the London he appa-
rently knows so well; the two doctors, one
in France and one in England, so skilfully
etched in; his valet, who has been taken
down from life with the kodak of science, or
I am very much mistaken.
t Ivor Marlay is cursed from liis birth by
‘the bar sinister.” He is a love-child ; his
father, the usual married “belted Earl,” ran
away with a girl whom he loved madly, and
the pair hid theniselves for a few precious
years in Italy. Suddenly both died together,
leaving the son without a name but with a
large fortune. The pair were both well
known in Society, and their son moved
amongst the highest circles. Handsome,
rich and capable! he showed that he could
not escape the wiles of “the wickedest women
in London,” and you follow him to the in-
evitable end. In the journey you come on
such passages as this, which tells of the
London of five years ago:—
The press was also critical. And in war-like
minds the question of “drugs” was found to be in-
separable from the question of “aliens.” It was sug-
gested that this kind of thing was un-English ; and
the “Huns” got somehow mixed up with the death
by cocaine of an American gentleman. The Daily
Mail, in quest of honor, Mr. Asquith’s head, two-
million circulation, and as yet uninterned Germans,
jousted once again with the Hidden Hand of the
Hun. Fierce gentlemen in Parliament were moved
to denunciation of England’s levity in its treat-
ment of “aliens” ; and Mr. Pemberton Billing got
the whole thing frightfully mixed up wjth the inade-
quacy of London’s air defences... .The war-fever
was at its highest in 1915. The only person who
kept his head, besides the soldiers who were too
busy fighting, was Mr. Bernard Shaw: which was
why everyone wanted to punch it for him.
The book is poignantly bitter for those who
can run and read. It is, moreover, true,
and Arlen’s sparkling sketches of the town
as he saw it ought to be kept to give
to the grandchildren of this generation.

Music and Life
Fewer good books are written about music
than the graphic arts. This is not surpris-
ing: for considering the nature of music it
would seem impossible to say anything at all
about it in words. A few musicians, like
Wagner and Berlioz, have written well about
their art; and from time to time a musician
who understands literature, or a literary
man who understands music, produces an
interesting and intelligible book, for which
music at least serves as an excellent pre-
text. Among English writers Ernest New-
man, of the old school, and W. J. Turner, of
the new, contrive to write about music in a
personal, natural style, and both are ex-
tremely readable. Newman has much
greater knowledge of music and a far
superior technical equipment; he is a highly-
trained professional musician turned jour-
nalist. On the other hand, Turner is a
man of letters, one of the most talented and
original of the so-called Georgian poets, and
an excellent ci’itic of literature and the
drama. lie is not a musician, but a literary
man who loves music, and delights in. help-
ing others to Jove it. Turner happens to
be an Australian by birth and early educa-
tion ; but as all his work has been done in
England, and he finds his inspiration there,
we can hardly claim him as one of our own.
Newman's book, “A Musical Motley,” repre-
sents the good, solid, orthodox opinions of
the average educated Englishman. Turner’s
Music and Life, a collection of essays
from the New Statesman, comes almost as
a challenge from the younger generation. It
is fresh and stimulating, often charming and
illuminating, but just, as often extravagant,
lopsided and provocative. Certainly it is
provocative. The author seems often to
take a malicious pleasure in making the most
outrageous statements, as though he were
laying down axioms. But he is always a
daring critic, full of ideas, and with humor,
insight and a fairly consistent philosophy
of art.
"Back to Mozart!” might be the motto of
"Music and Life.” In an eloquent passage,
which clearly indicates his central idea he
writes: —
Mozart haunts us because, though he is not acade-
mic, he does not harrow our emotional nerves; lie
is not like Wagner, a man letting off rockets in
an excited crowd; or Tschaikowsky, a sentimentalist
crying for the moon; or Brahms, a middle-aged
man remembering his mother and his first love; or
Franck, a man shut out from Heaven; he is not
a mere tube through which blow his aspirations,
his sentiments and his regrets in a more or less
chaotic flood, he is that most mysterious of Nature's
secrets, a great creative artist, whose work, purged
of all emotional dross, flies straight at the imagina-
tion.
Any emotional display, anything that might
send the listener to open a packet of old
love-letters or join a brass band, he regards
simply as bad art. It is because of their
emotional appeal that not only Brahms and
Wagner, or Tschaikowsky, but the mighty
Beethoven himself he ranks below Bach and
Mozart, whom he considers purer and more
perfect artists.
There is a fine essay on Debussy, a more
debatable one on Stravinsky, as well as
lively papers on audiences, programme
music, jazz and a variety of kindred sub-
jects. Turner indulges in a few “stunts” ;
but no critic would be quite human if he
had no stunts, no prejudices or caprices,
which may be a peculiar sign of his sin-
cerity. Any good reader may enjoy the book
for its literary entertainment; but its out-
standing merit is the quality it has of stimu-
lating in its readers a keener and deeper
interest in music itself.
L.E.
The Doctor in Literature
Very seldom is the hero of a novel a
doctor - . He may be an engineer, journalist,
actor, parson, artist, wowser or just piam
male; but doctor —never! And if some
demon should tempt an author to make a
hero of his doctor, how utterly unhuman he
seems! Stark Munro, Red-pepper burns and
that ilk are conventional only in their
absurdity. But there are innumerable
secondary characters supposed to be doctors,
and the greater the author the more catas-
trophic is his fall. Kipling's doctors may
resemble the doctors of the old Indian army,
but they do not resemble those of Macquane-
street or Woop Woop. Leonard Merrick, in
“The Man Who Was Good,” has drawn a
recognisable portrait, but it is too sentimental
for any known doctor. At first one thinks that
novelists tight shy of the doctor because they
don’t know anything about him ; but that
cannot be true, for they all, with splendid
temerity, draw women, of whom 1 dare
swear they know even less. No novelist,
male or female, has ever understood a
woman, because she does not understand her-
self —if I may be so rude as to say
so. (The varying influences that guide a
woman on her path through life deserve an
encyclopaedia, and have never, so far as I
know, been fairly set forth.) Yet there are,
as is generally known, women in the world,
and it is impossible to write a novel with-
out drawing them.
Yet w'ho shall describe the mind of a
modern doctor —that slightly cynical, un-
sentimental, warm-hearted, benevolent, in-
quisitive, self-sacrificing, mocking, intensely-
sceptical, intensely-credulous, agnostic, stoic,
epicurean, kindly, generous slave to duty,
who, of the third sex, has no faith, very
little hope, and as much charity as he can
afford ? The public would not believe it.
Probably the doctor would not believe it
either, because he is too sceptical to see him-
self as he really is. The public thinks of
the doctor more or less highly than he really
deserves. Either he becomes a sort of
beneficent demi-god, like the old doctor in
“Beside the Bonny Briar-bush,” which is
absurd, or he is sunk in brute selfishness,
e-rasping for a fee, which is generally the
last thing a doctor grasps for, because he
knows it is no use, and that he will cer-
tainly be the last to be paid. But nobody
would believe an author if he drew a doctor
as he really is, and few authors have either
the skill or the courage to try.
C. McL.
An Academy of Literature
“D.M.W.” concludes the controversy:—
A. Hart (R.P. 15/3/’23) asks what great writer
failed to find a publisher while still alive. Obviously
that question is impossible to answer. I have no
record of the world’s great lost manuscripts nor of
its broken hearts; and my challenger is in exactly
the same position. He does not know; I do not
know; therefore his challenge is mere wind.
But this I do know. Without the assistance of
patrons, or the private means of the authors them-
selves, one-half of our best English literary work
would not have appeared while the authors lived,
and probably not at all. Shelley’s attempts to find
publishers were pathetic; and nothing is more
certain than that if he had been a poor man most
of his best work would have missed print altogether.
On the authority of Buxton Forman, not one of the
three volumes of his verse which appeared during
the lifetime of Keats bears a publisher’s name; all
carry the printer’s imprint alone. Yet the tenth-
rate writers of the time had no difficulty in offering
their works to the public through the best channels.
When I rempmber the frailty of mere paper and the
enormous difficulty of getting to the press I cannot
feel any sort of glorious certainty that the best
always survives.
But the outstanding example of fame based on
posthumous publication is surely that of William
Shakspeare. Many of his plays had seen print
before the folio edition; but who doubts that it is
on the posthumous folio edition that his fame rests?
Macbeth ’ was not only not printed during its
author’s lifetime, but tradition says it had even
ceased to exist in manuscript and was taken down,
with all its errors, from the lips of actors. A
number of the other plays were posthumously pub-
lished for the first time. I do not know whether
this had anything to do with the publishing condi-
tions of the time or not; but I do know that a
“Macbeth” similarly left by its author in Australia
to-day would be dead forever.
A- Hart does a lot of wide and wild shooting
some miles from the point I aimed at in my first
suggestion, but when a writer says he is going to
criticise and then merely mentions a few points,
clouds them with irrelevant matter and then says
“I cannot convince myself,” I do not know that his
remarks call for any answer. One thing, however, he
does make clear. He considers that 100 literary
men of standing in N. S. Wales would make us the
laughing stock of the world ! There are to be, on
his calculation, 3,000,000 of people in the State;
and because one in 30,000 has risen to high distinc-
tion in the highest- branch of human endeavor the
world must find the situation ridiculous. Why? If
it is ridiculous to have among us 100 people of
highest achievement it is surely ridiculous to have
one. I am afraid I can only leave Mr. Hart to his
laughter. I should like to see 10,000 where there
is one to-day; and it would worry me very little
to think that all the long ears in three distant con-
tinents were waggling at the spectacle.
The Inky Way
“T. 0.1.”: March 6 was the 120th anniversary of
the first publication of Australia’s first newspaper,
the Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Adver-
tiser. The proprietor and publisher was George
Howe, who was a West Indian, and had, it was
said, worked on the London Times.
“P.A.L.”: The alluring stories from Sydney and
Melbourne of colossal salaries, bank-manager hours
and editorships for the asking are having their
effect on Maoriland journalists. Latest departures
include Vic White, a well-known inky wayfarer
with a smile “full as the moon in May,” and pushful
Henry Bateson. There are others left behind who
fondly imagine that you can get 15 of the best per
week in Aussie for an output of a stick and a half
per day, and who are going to catch the Sydney boat
at the first opportunity.
“Bill Bowyang”: On the tombstone of Mark
Twain’s daughter Susie there is an epitaph which
runs:
Warm summer sun,
Shine kindly here ;
Warm southern wind,
Blow softly here;
Green sod above,
Lie light, lie light;
Good night, dear heart,
Good night, good night.
Yankee papers have again and again attributed these
verses to Mark Twain; but they were written by
Robert Richardson, an Australian. They appeared
in a book of his, published in Edinburgh in 1893,
under the title of “Willow and Wattles.”
“Huffin-Guffin”: The Argus has been speaking
severely of the Postal Department for keeping up
twopenny postage “four years after the war
is over” and making big profits thereby. Yet the
2d. postage and the 2d. Argus were introduced
almost simultaneously, and for similar reasons. And
it is only this month that the newspaper has
come down to lid. Which suggests that its virtuous
indignation at the protracted profiteering in the
Postmaster-General’s Department is a trifle over-
done.
“Lucius” : Exit the Geelong Times, one of Vic.’s
oldest provincial dailies. In the early ’seventies Bcn-
jariiin Hoare helped to give it a start. He was joined by
William Bell, who found the money. The partner-
ship ended with a dispute that gave an Equity
Court judge a long job, and Hoare left Geelong. The
Times was carried on by Bell, junior, who became a
Harbor Trust Commissioner, and fell foul of most
of those whose support was worth having. So it
goes out, leaving the Advertiser (whose claim to
be the oldest morning journal in Vic. is one of its
greatest assets) with a monopoly on the shores of
Corio Bay.
“E”: Professor MacKail, an authority on classics
and English poetry, and the biographer of William
Morris, is to invade Australia as a lecturer. So far
this country has not shown much affection for
this form of entertainment. In the U.S.A. it is
nearly as popular as candy. G. K. Chesterton,
Wilfrid Gibson, W. B. Yeats, John Drinkwater, J.
C. Squire and Hugh Walpole have all recently
collected many dollars in this way; now Rebecca
West and Francis Brett Young have booked pas-
sages for the land of easy money. The one liter-
ary celebrity America could never entice over is
Bernard Shaw.
“Riverina”: In a “Manual of English Grammar
and Composition,” by J. C. Nesfteld, M.A., I came
across this amazing statement: “Rime is a matter of
the ear, and not of the eye....fight is a true rime
to indict, dawn to morn, fourth to cloth, fire to
higher, hour to power, there to air, colonel to in-
fernal. Pronunciation, not spelling, is the only
test of a rime.” I don’t know what decently-tuned
ear could accept “fourth”-“cloth” as a rhvine.
Nevertheless, this manual was used some years ago
in Maoriland High Schools—maybe it is still in use
—arid is possibly responsible for some of the flood
of “dawn”-“morn” stuff which sweeps toward The
Bulletin each week and fills the office with lamen-
tations.
A Satchel of Books
Jldw to Run a Shop, by Harold Whitehead (Harrap
and Co.)- This supplies a working- knowledge in
simple, direct language of the principles and
practices of retail merchandising. In other words,
it tells you how to steer a small Shop away from
the Bankruptcy Court. It is a book that every
little shopkeeper should have. The chapters on
“Profit and Loss” and “Turnover” are particularly
illuminating, and there is another devoted
to the problems of shop locations that should
prove invaluable to the just-about-to-begin retailer.
The author has been for some years teaching retail-
store management in the College of Business Admin-
istration in Boston University.
Sariska Bcnori, by Barbara Dale Smith (Mc-
Cubbin, Melbourne). By working out a little sum,
you can learn from a sort of preface that the
author is a girl of 19. This largely disarms the
critic. All that is left for him to say is that by
the time she is 30 she will probably be very annoyed
with somebody for having allowed her to publish
the crude melodramatic nonsense. And she may
also be equally annoyed with her publisher for not
doing his part of the mistake a great deal better.
Tracks through the Bush, by W. Robertson
(Robertson and Mullens). The writer has the Presby-
terian kirk at Ilay (N.S.W.), and his little book
consists of a series of pleasant, papers about the
roads he knows —with moral reflections and plenti-
ful quotations of verse. Incidentally, writing of
Nap Nap station and the Ronalds who own it, Mr.
Robertson mentions (in discursive' papers of this
sort anything may be mentioned) that ex-Prime
Minister Reid was a descendant of “Bonnie Jean”
Ronald, celebrated by Bobbie Burns. “Gilbert Burns,
the poet’s younger brother, made advances to Jean
and was iejected on account of his poverty, and she
then married John Reid, farmer, Langlands,” who
was George’s grandfather.

are not
“ know it all ”
to read this page.
Among the men enrolled in
the Alexander Hamilton
L Institute there are more
than 24,000 business heads.
The Institute welcomes inquiries
from such men, but this particu-
lar page is not addressed to
them.
There are nearly 25,000
directors, secretaries and treas-
urers on the Institute s rolls, but
this page is not for such officials.
Neither is it for the wise
young man who is perfectly
satisfied with himself and his
business equipment; who knows
that the only reason he is not
paid twice as much is because
he has never been “given a
chance.”
This page is a personal mes-
sage to the man who has respon-
sibilities, who feels secretly that
he ought to be earning several
hundred pounds more a year,
but who simply lacks the confi-
dence necessary to lay hold on
one of the bigger places in busi-
ness. We would like to put into
the hands of every such man a
copy of a little book that con-
tains the seeds of self-confidence.
It is called “Forging Ahead in
Business,” and it is sent without
obligation.
We have in mind, for example,
a certain man who is now chief
accountant of a great company.
Until he was thirty-one years of
age he was a book-keeper. His
employees had made up their
minds that he would always be
a book-keeper. His wife was
beginning secretly to wonder.
Worst of all, he was himself be-
ginning to lost faith.
He sent for ‘Forging Ahead
in Business”; without any great
hope in its results, he enrolled in
the Modern Business Course and
Service. The first few months
of his association with the Alex-
ander Hamilton Institute were a
revelation to him. He found
himself being initiated into de-
partments of business that had
hithero been a mystery to him.
He was learning the fundamen-
tals of purchasing, of merchan-
dising, of advertising, of office
and factory management, and
corporation finance.
He began quietly to make sug-
gestions to the officials —sugges-
tions that surprised them, be-
cause they had ceased to expect
anything from him. They re-
vised their estimate of his capa-
cities; when the position of chief
accountant became vacant, he
was given his chance. And re-
cently, in an important tax
matter, he argued against the
position of the company’s own
solicitors—basing his argument
on principles which the Institute
had taught—and by proving his
point succeeded in saving the
company £12,000.
The self-confidence that the
Institute gave him has trans-
formed that man. He will be a
director of that great corpora-
tion ; and at 31 he was con-
demned to be a book-keeper for
life.
For the man who is perfectly
content with himself and his job
the Alexander Hamilton Insti-
tute can do nothing. But there
are thousands of men who could
double their incomes in one year
if they believed in themselves
and had the solid business know-
ledge to back up their belief.
To such men the Institute
offers Forging Ahead in Busi-
ness —a book with power in
every page, and which also
describes clearly and interest-
ingly what the Alexander Ham-
ilton Institute can do for you.
Thousands of successful men re-
gard it as one of the most valu-
able little books they ever sent
for. May we send it to you? The
coupon is for your convenience.

SINGLE-SIX SEVEN PASSENGER TOURING
THERE is a deeper significance in the
Packard Slogan, "Ask the man who
owns one,” than appears on the surface.
What is it in tfie Packard Single Six that
has awakened in its owners an allegiance
that any other car seems powerless to disturb?
The fundamental cause, of course, is the
consistent perfection of Packard Single Six
performance, but there are many other
reasons than this.
The excellent grace and beauty of this aris-
tocrat of cars has inspired a pride of owner-
ship which is in keeping with all the fine
old traditions of Packard.
A moment’s thought will convince you that
you have never seen a Packard body that
showed any signs of disrepair or dilapidation.
You will recall again that you have almost
never heard a Packard knock or grind or
rattle. Every part remains solid and staunch
and true.
Single Sixes that have years of service and
tens of thousands of miles behind them
still hold that glorious lustre of their enamel
and paint.
Their doors "chuck” solidly shut; their con-
trols work smoothly and softly; every item
of equipment serves and looks as when new.
Such qualities as these have already made
a definite appeal to Australian motorists.
They have been awaiting a car sturdy
enough for our Australian conditions, and
withal combining the super-refinements of a
luxury car.

A Ballad of St. Stephen.
VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A stone was crying in the night
Under the moon’s ban :
“By the olive on the height
I slew a holy man.
“Drivsn of a man’s will —
This was cold fate —
I that lay stone-still
Flew a flight «sf hate.
“All the stones of Olivet
Are grey with old dread;
But I am wet, wet, wet
With true blood shed.”
Whereat another voice arose
And made a thin wail:
“111 and ill a stone knows
The sorrow of a nail.
“Once you smote and death was kind;
But they drove me in a tree
With a man’s flesh to make me blind
To a Goa’s agony.
“For I am a nail of Holy Cross
That nailed the Lord's left palm
To the red beam of world’s loss;
And the shame of nails I am.”
Far over the night’s moan
St. Stephen heard them speak.
Oh, he came from Heaven and set the stone
Against his breast meek!
So that which slew was comforted:
But there is no tale
Wherein it hath been writ or said
That the Lord saved the nail.
N.s.w.

Legacy.
I shall set down ere yet my youth is flown
That I may read them in cold, loveless
years, - •
The hot, delightful hours that I have known ;
Such things, that wretched age shall fall
to tears,
And cry in wonderment: “This cannot be,
That this was I who knew such hot de-
sires,”
And numbly feel some little ecstasy
Among the cold, grey ashes of those fires.
I shall embalm such thing as Autumn days,
And smoke-filled gardens, uplands, daisy-
pied,
And poplar-trees with which the cool wind
plays.
And lighted railway trains, with love in-
side ;
For when youth falls behind, Love lingers
too,
And then I shall forget what Love could do.

Be drank his grog and told of sailor days—
For youth and ships had lured him to the
sea—•
Of quaint old craft, and ports where mates
and he
Roystered, and fought for wanton women’s
praise.
And as his sea-lined features caught the blaze
We saw his eyes glow in the memory
Of eerie nights when strange things came
to be
On charted tracks, or wild, unbeaten ways.
We, who were landsmen, drank the stories
in,
Gripped by a vivid language of the past,
And sailed a charmed hour before the mast
Upon the rolling waters of romance—
Knew thrills of peril, times of wine and sin,
Strange lands and peoples, fortune and mis-
chance.

I pictured you a tree of scarlet flame
That lorded it above exotic blooms —•
A flower that glimmers in a wanton’s
rooms
And watches knowingly the merry game,
Indulgent to the kiss and sudden laughter,
Unmindful of the tears that follow after.
But you—you are so saintly-white, so sweet
In your green gown and golden-hearted
stars.
There is no blemish and no spot that mars
You from your crown of snow to grass-
crown feet.
Your flowers are purer than a white nun’s
hand,
Gentler than grey rain in a springtime land.
Drowsily in your shade I lie and bless
Your blossoms, falling on my upturned
face,
Weaving my tawdry soul a crown of grace.
Till my numb heart grows warm with ten-
derness.
They shower me as a sudden benison.
Yielding me happiness I have not won.
A little wind springs up, and sends a gust
Of creamy blossoms beating on my chair —-
They beat about the garden everywhere.
A cool sirocco of sweet-scented dust.
The wind is gone and the white petals lie
Like shredded scraps of whitest ivory.
I shall remember you, my friendly tree,
In weary days and aching city streets;
Remembering how the morning sunlight
beats
In this quiet garden turning to the sea.
Will you remember, as you rest from play,
How you gave one sad soul a hapnv day?
QUEENSLAND.

EXCITING DAYS IN QUEENSLAND.
In its decision to go to the country some time
ahead of the date when Parliament was
bound to die of old age, the Queensland Min-
istry is guided by the idea that it might go
farther and fare worse. One kind of Gov-
ernment likes to go to the country before
the financial year closes (in this case, on
June 30), and before the deficit and the need
for more taxes or more dismissals of super-
fluous public servants are announced. An-
other and a rarer variety prefers to wait
and make its appeal in the limelight of pros-
perity and reduced taxation. The Queens-
land ‘ Government falls naturally into the
first category. Its recent existence has been
stormy. It got through the Rockhampton
Labor Conference without being censured
and declared “black” or even dark brown;
yet, though four Ministers had seats in the
Conference, and voted strenuously for them-
selves. the margin between Theodore and
condemnation got as low as two votes. Dur-
ing the past session the Ministry was saved
on 20 occasions by the casting vote of either
the Speaker or the Chairman of Committees.
It was saved a great deal oftener than that
bv the Premier personating absent members
—as many as four in one night. He didn’t
accomplish this after the picturesque fashion
of the man who dresses up in a fellow crea-
ture’s clothes, and paints his face to make
if a living resemblance, and imitates the
other man’s cough or his brogue. Theo-
dore simply adopted, or adapted, the Ger-
man Upper House idea of voting by proxy,
and, as ho or one of his colleagues had the
proxy of every member of the party, chances
and accidents were practically eliminated.
And as the Opposition, even though it had
no hope of influencing a division, had a lot
of hard and logical things to say which might
influence an election, the gag was applied
in the last days of the session so that the
things should not be said. Even if the posi-
tion was as secure as it looked until Par-
liament died in due course of time, the habit
of living within one vote of destruction by
enemies inside the House, and amid the vitu-
peration of friends outside, must have been
a wearing sort of life. Further, there was
the unpleasant spectacle of a combination
arrived at between the two Oppositions.
They still muster only 20 and 15, or 35 in
all against 37, but now that they have sunk
their differences they may make headway
with the electors, and the less time left them
for that purpose the better. On the other
hand, it isn't likely that delay would make
the very unfriendly element in the Rock-
hampton conference any more cordial.
The Theodore finances are bleak, and
grow bleaker. In every financial year since
the Government took office, until June, 1921,
more and more taxes were put on, and the
revenue responded with a rise—not enough
to keep Theodore’s finances. straight, h r
nothing could do that, but a big rise all the
same. Last financial year the usuai pro-
cess was followed, but the revenue responded
with a fall, the faithful animal being ( ex-
hausted and played out. Every other State
showed an improvement, but Theodore’s
beast failed in its stride. The threadbare
explanation of all the Cabinet’s troubles is
that cruel people in London conspired to cut
oil the State’s supply of loan money when
it repudiated the pastoralists’ leases and
began to extract huge fines from them in
the name of imaginary arrears of rent. But
whatever cruel people in London might do,
loan money was got in huge quantities from
somewhere, at some price or another. And
the land revenue, supplemented by the rob-
bery practised on the pastoralists, has been
magnificent. In 1921, the last complete year
covered by the latest volume of Federal
statistics, some of the figures were remark-
able :—-
Receipts pee Inhabitant in 1921.
Average
Next Highest of Six
Queensland. State. States.
Land revenue ..£237 £165 19 1
Tax revenue . . 417 11 310 8 £3 7 3
Loan money .. 11 4 4 9 10 10 6 3 5
The “Loan money” item is the amount added
to the debt in the course of the year, whether
wholly spent during the year or not. The
“next highest State” was N. S. Wales in
one case; Tasmania in another; Westralia
in a third. But Theodore’s State had the
advantage every time. The one heading
under which it fell far below the average
and ranked fourth instead of first on the
list, was “Revenue from Public Works and
Services,” “Public Works and Services” run
by a Theodore Government having the
same chance as a metal furnace managed by
whales. It was this land of good fortune
and lots-of-money which achieved still an-
other first place at the end of last year, with
124 unionists unemployed out of every 1000,
against other records of 114 (N.S.W.), 89
(W.A.), 52 (Victoria), 39 (Tasmania), and
33 (S.A.). For all the dribbling away of
money there isn’t even a patch of crude
magnificence to Show.
* * * *
The Commonwealth tax-collector also be-
gins to have a poor opinion of Queensland.
That State yielded £177,261 less income-tax
in 1921 than in the year before, while the
other States yielded £1,680,545 more.
Queensland supplied £26,086 less land-tax,
while the other States paid £71,479 more.
The collections of wartime-profits tax
dropped not quite 20 p-p cent, all round in
1921, but in Queensland the drop was over
46 per cent. South Australia, with less
than two-thirds Queensland’s population,
and less than half its area, paid the Com-
monwealth, in 1921, £1,863,937 in land, in-
come, war-profits and probate taxes, while
Theodore’s wrecked country contributed
only £1,570,002. The difference is Theo-
dore —just Theodore. During his term of
misgovernment the railways, a payable pro-
position before his time, have, lost about
£8,500,000 Four State mines are £135,000
to the bad. The State fishery and cannery
have lost £70,000 between them. The State
cattle stations are between £400,000 and
£500,000 short. In addition there were lost
ali the taxes of all sorts which these enter-
prises would have paid if left in private
hands, for as soon as anything passes to
Government ownership it is taken off the tax
list, to make a bogus profit or minimise in
bogus fashion a real loss. So if all things
were socialised in Queensland fashion there
would be no taxes at all—only losses.
Theodore’s jobs were mostly petty ones,
which would have had little effect on the
life of the community if they had succeeded.
They unanimously didn’t succeed. Still, they
provided billets for a mighty drove of para-
sites ; in fact, the Premier has admitted that
practically all the new taxation (about
£2,000,000 per annum) has gone in paying
good wages in his various money-losing
undertakings. The money went, in other
words, to purchase political gratitude. And
the price at which the Rockhampton Labor
Conference refrained from turning Theodore
down was his promise to start many new
businesses as bad as the old ones. If the
general body of the people like paying for
these things, well and vood. The man under
whom the State’s taxation per head has
more than doubled in five years can no doubt
do as well in the next five. . If, however,
they think there must be a limit to that sort
of thing, they will decide to try a change.
THE PRIDE OF NATIONS.
National pride runs in all shapes. The
gap is tremendous, for example, between one
of those American States which last cen-
tury repudiated their financial liabilities
with the cheery effrontery of Mr. Micawber
tendering an lOU, and England, of which
the Times remarked last month: —
Respect for word and bond is the greatest of
England’s assets. The sanctity of contract has
reached a higher development in this country than
in any other. It has done more than anything else
to build up English industry and English honor
abroad. It constitutes the foundation of credit.
In France the master impulse has been con-
cerned since the Revolutionary wars not
so much with commercial honor as with the
necessity of keeping French soil unpolluted
by an invader. By the P rank-
fort France was required, in 1871, to cede
Alsace and Lorraine and pay an indemnity
of £200,000,000. (This was in respect of a
war that had lasted not four years but six
months, and in which not a single German
cathedral or church or farm or field had
been so much as scratched by the French
enemy.) The French handed over their
richest provinces like good losers, and paid
the indemnity. To guard against dereliction
as regards the second obligation, the Ger-
mans —businesslike in all things—put in a
bailiff-army and intimated that it would be
quartered on the nation until the last franc
had been delivered. This step was of great
assistance to Thiers, for the pride of the
French was stung. Men flung half their for-
tunes, women all their jewels into the re-
parations pool, and foreign financiers, see-
ing that the nation meant business, pressed
loan-money upon the Government. Inside
three years the Germans were marching
home again with the last instalment of the
indemnity in their pockets.
Germany has another kind of pride. It
is expressed in elaborate uniforms, in march-
ing and counter-marching, incessant salut-
ing and springing to attention, martial songs
mostly of a menacing character, and gener-
ally in the sort of existence which is a
middle-aged sergeant-major’s notion of
Heaven. It is here that the militarism of
Germany differs from that of France. The
typical German worships parade-ground sol-
diering, the typical Frenchman soldiering
in the field. The Germans fought the World
War amid vociferous threats and boastings
of what they would do to their enemies after
they had won. France was to be reduced to
the level of Holland. Amongst other resolu-
tions passed by the six great national
Leagues which swayed the Government right
up to the failure of the 1918 offensive (the
League of Landed Property-owners, the
Peasants’ League, the Christian Peasants’
Union, the Central League of German Manu-
facturers, the Manufacturers’ Union and
the Imperial Middle-Class League) was this
joint manifesto: —
It is necessary with a view to securing our sea-
power and our future that Belgium be subjected
militarily and by tariff policy, as well as by mon-
etary and postal system, to the laws of the German
Empire. Its railways and waterways must be merged
into our system of communications.
Meanwhile what remained of France and
Belgium fought on in bitter silence. They
left the tall talk to us; and, to do the Empire
justice, it did not fail them. The two chief
peace terms of the Liberal Prime Minister
Asquith were: —
(1) Germany must pay for the whole of the
damage done in the occupied areas.
(2) Germany must punish the person guilty of
the fearful crimes committed by its armed forces.
The Liberal Prime Minister Lloyd George
promised in England’s name to hang the
Kaiser and to “search his subject’s pockets’’
for the reparation-money, if it was not forth-
coming otherwise. The Germans had hardly
lost the war when they began boasting that
they had won it in the field but had been
betrayed by the civilian population at home.
Their pride as a nation of warriors being
thus preserved, they proceeded to use the
civilian population as an excuse to avoid
paying their reparation debts. They are
doing it still. There are two familiar classes
of debtors in commercial life. The self-
respecting one squares his jaw, says little
about the unfortunate speculation which
brought him low, and concentrates on the
business of paying off what he owes. The
other type whines about his starving wife
and children as a reason why he should be
handed a clean receipt and allowed to begin
all over again. Yet he has his proper pride,
and the creditor who suggests some concrete
method of economy—dispensing with a ser-
vant or the family motor-car, say—-is imme-
diately the centre of a storm of objurgation
and reproach. Germany has defaulted to
France, yet personal taxation in Germany
is still ridiculously small compared with
that even of Britain. The London Daily
Mail estimates that German industrial
magnates have over three times as much
money as France paid Germany under the
Frankfort Treaty lodged safely abroad in
fpreign securities. The coal tax is being
evaded with the connivance of the Govern-
ment ; and the reason for all those things
may be found in a complaint published in
the' Welt-am-Montag and cabled here a
few days ago: “The German policy haS
always been to spare property. Capital
and property come first; the Treasury last.”
The Germans could have the French out of
the Ruhr within a month by retrenching the
family motor-car, but their pride forbids
the step. They are too proud to pay.
Those who are doing propagandist work
for Germany at the moment offer two rea-
sons why the Empire should disown “the
French burglars.” One is based on morality,
the other on self-interest. In support of the
first they argue that France is not in the
Ruhr to collect money; and they point with
evident pleasure to the fact that the patriotic
sabotage of Germany is making it daily
more difficult for Germany’s creditors to
collect anything. They say that France is
really there to lay the threat of a risen and
revengeful Germany. But if that threat
exists it is our shame. Prime Minister
Asquith, speaking for the British Empire
at the Guildhall, said: —
We shall never sheathe the sword... .until France
is adequately secured against the menace of German
aggression.
And if the threat does not exist, why are
the Germans, as individuals, making no such
attempt as individual French citizens made
half-a-century ago to free their soil of the
foreign debt-collector? The answer is to
be found in the second batch of anti-French
arguments with which the German apologists
are attempting to make our blood freeze. It
is contended that unless the German debtor
is given a clean discharge he will do some-
thing calculated to bring Europe, and with
it the Empire, to ruin. This is another ver-
sion of the old unconvincing promise of
suicide which almost every dishonest bank-
rupt makes (but never fulfils) at some stave
of his career. It is almost certainly bluff
put up in the hope of gaining terms.
Assume, however, that it is not bluff.
Assume that the French occupation is liable
to produce another revolution in Germany
with disastrous results to British trade.
This paper still asserts that Britain cannot
afford to go back on the French. The
nation’s chief source of pride is concerned in
the matter —that “respect for word and
bond” which, in the Times phrase, “is the
greatest of England’s assets.” The principle
is identically the same as that which is in-
spiring the Bonar Law Government to pay
back the £851,000,000 borrowed from the
U.S.A. during the war. It is immaterial
that, in practice, much of the money was
spent on the defence of the U.S. The point
is that repayment is in the bond. And simi-
larly reparations and security are in the
bond, put there by Britain’s spokesmen on
scores of public occasions, and endorsed by
every representative institution, from Par-
liament and the Established Church dow-n-
-wards. Whetuer France lives or dies is a
little thing to most Englishmen. But if
France should experience another Sedan,
50 years hence, as a result of the repudia-
tion by England to-day of the promises
made when the British Empire was in deadly
peril, then the nation will sacrifice some-
thing that no conceivable trade benefit will
repay. Any German will be in a position
to say to any Englishman: “You English
are like us. You talk big during a war, but
sing small after it. You promise your allies
the world while there is danger,.- and when
they have served their turn you desert them
for your late enemies. Frederic, our great-
est king and general, set the fashion. Its
justification is that, at the time, it pays.”
THE CINDERELLA TERRITORY.
Papua, the Cinderella Territory of the
Commonwealth, which, properly developed
and garrisoned by white Australians, would
be a rampart between the millions of Asia
and the mother-continent, had a strenuous
battle for existence during 1921-22. A few
figures can best show the effect both of the
unprecedented drop in the prices of rubber
and copra and of the working of the Naviga-
tion Act which Hughes inflicted upon the
disfranchised infant: —

The only bright spots in the record are the
increases in the planted area and the gold
output. Misima w r as the cause of the in-
creased gold yield; as the mine is now closed
the revenue will be without its help this
year. But a significant and hopeful sign,
hopeful for those Australians who have
given their lives and money to developing
Papua’s rich lands, is the increase m the
planted acreage, despite the fall in rubber
and copra values. Prospects here are good.
Copra is a staple that will always be in
request bv the over-populated lands of tne
Old World; people must have vegetable tat,
and will probably continue to wash at odd
times with soap, and these things the cocoa-
nut provides. Rubber was a bright dream
that turned into a nightmare; but the hope
of the planters that a rise in price would
come with the new year was justified by tne
commodity climbing up to the vicinity o
17d. a pound, where it remains. Every
rubber plantation was closed during most of
1921-22, but since last December the tappers
have been at work again, so 1922-23 will see
a considerable export. _
But copra is the early hope of the -terri-
tory, for as the planted, areas come into
bearing the export will increase two- and
three-fold every year. This will mean more
outward freight; but the monopoly created
by the Navigation Act will continue to skim
the cream off the profits, unless tne
Bruce-Page Government repeals its appli-
cation to Papua. Some of the results of this
law are interesting. Experimentally, a ton
of sandalwood was consigned from Moresby
to Thursday Island, where the Chinese
buyers were doing business. Owing totneie
being no direct vessel from Papua, the wood
had to be dragged to Cairns and transhipped
from that port to its destination. The wood
brought £2l when sold, but freight and
handling charges absorbed nearly £l-
- shipper had spent about £l9 in cutti »
and in carting the timber out of the forest,
he lost £2 on the venture. Copra and an
other products strike the same hurdle, toi
they must be dragged to Sydney to tranship
into a bottom for Europe or America, it
the copra goes to England via the lone.
Strait route, the steamer drags it back an-
other 2000 miles—4ooo miles in all —before
it finally starts on the road to the market.
The unfortunate planter or trader has to
pay for this useless haulage; but the agents
and brokers of Sydney get their profit, ao
doubt it is all very fair for the parasite—
but it is deadly for the man m the jungle
among the reformed anthropophagi, is i
any wonder that he begins to lose all affec-
tion for the country that gave him birth.
When John Bull decided that it was up
to Australia to take hold of British New
Guinea, the statesmen of those days promptly
started thinking up fancy brands of legisla-
tion to try on the new Territory of I apua.
One ever-active brigade sprang into action
and got the Papua Act to include a section
limiting the number of liquor licenses, for
they thought that the curse of drink would
get loose among the natives. The Solon
had no thought that they were creating a
liquor monopoly. Section 21 (1) °f tbe
Papua Act (1905) reads: After the com-
mencement of this Act licenses shall not be
granted in the Territory in excess of the
number of licenses in existence at the com-
mencement of this Act.” Sixteen license
were in existence at that time, and to that
number we are restricted. Naturally, if a
person wishes to have a license transferred
to him —he cannot obtain a new license he
discovers that a heavy bonus is asked tor
the sixteenth share in the monopoly. Moie-
over 12 of these 16 licenses are controlled
bv four firms. Only four hotels cater for
the retail trade over the bar and provide
hoard and lodging for the travelling public.
Board of the commonest kind is £lO a month.
Pussyfoot says that this stupid legislation
is “for the welfare of the native. But t°e
native has no taste for liquor; m 20 years 1
have not observed more than four aboriginal
Papuans drunk. The liquor monopoly is,
however, a very real danger; and the absence


of accommodation, the result of the mono-
poly-grant, is a very present hardship.
All the muddle is caused by Australia not
bothering to find out what her long-neglected
and shamefully-treated Territory really needs.
The Hughes Government talked loudly of
giving the Australians settled in Papua the
franchise; but it has not materialised so far.
Rather the possibility of the Territory being-
placed under ecclesiastical domination
has been before the public. Much good
breath has been wasted by very estimable
gentlemen anent the “sacred duty of safe-
guarding the native interests,” but little has
been said of similar action for the disfran-
chised Australian who has risked his all in
trying to make a savage land into a home
fur the white race. The white settler in
I’apua is also the white protector of his
Brown Brother. Leaving all humane con-
siderations out of the argument, the decent
white settlers of Papua—and 95 per cent,
of them are of the best type of Australian
manhood —are quite cognisant of their duty
toward the brown peoples whom fate has
placed in their charge. “The native is
Papua’s best asset” is not alone the belief
of the missionaries; every white resident of
the Territory fully grants the fact, and will
tell you that without the useful brown man
the place would be a second Northern Ter-
ritory—a White Elephant.
The missionary may wail about the “ex-
ploitation of the poor native.” but if a cnre-
fill observer goes into the Companies Office
in Moresby and searches the Registrar’s re-
cords of the various planting and mining
companies that are operating or have
operated within Papua, he will discover that
only two concerns have ever declared a
dividend. Millions of pounds of English and
Australian .money have been sunk in the
Territory since the Commonwealth took it
over, but to date not one of these companies
lias “exploited” anything but their share-
holders’ coin. The aboriginal Papuan is a
contented person, and his government by the
“white foreigners” is quite to his taste ; only
the Chadbands have any comolaint about
exploitation. The cry is a popular one with
most, of the religious bodies operating in the
Territory, but in actual practice there has
been no exploitation of native interest. The
danger is. purely imaginary, and exists only
in the minds, of those zealous persons who
find life teaching the savage more restful and
comfortable than similar work would be in
Gun-alley or Woolloomooloo. Clerical gov-
ernment was never a success in any country
the wide world over. Democratic govern-
ment has been proved sound and workable
in the mother-continent; There is no reason
why it should not be tried in Panua. Let
the Territory have the franchise and it cannot
fail to forg-e ahead to its destined position
as the seventh. State of the Commonwealth,
but the following must accompany the gift
of the vote to the white settlers ;-A
1. A preferential tariff for Papuan products enter-
ini; Australia.
2. Repeal of the Navigation Act so far as it con-
cerns Papua.
3. Development of the oilfields by private enter-
prise.
4. A representative— -not a; gagged substitute—in
the Commonwealth Parliament.
Given these things Papua would go forward
on the road to .prosperity, for the jjotential
wealth of the colony is enormous A o-ine
policy is all that is wanted to make it a
second Java.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The White Australian Internationalist.
Addressing his Red masters at Moscow,
Garden, the latest pilgrim from these parts,
boasted that “we," meaning he and his
brother-Bolshies, mostly importations like
himself, “were able to change the policy of
the Australian Labor party.” This as a
result of the 1921 Trade Union Congress,
“the largest ever held in Australia, repre-
senting, as it did, 700,000 workers.” “The
Labor party,” Garden explained to the
gentry who have made robbery a religion,
"believed in the- maintenance of a White
Australia; believed in nationalisation. We
changed the old objective— i.c., ‘the cultiva-
tion of. an Australian sentiment based on
the maintenance of racial purity and the
development of an enlightened and self-
reliant community’—to ‘the socialisation of
industry.’ ” True, but, as Garden omitted
to mention, the achievement was ruinous to
“our” cause. Bolshevism was possibly dan-
gerous to the Commonwealth in 1921,' when
its emissaries dominated the Trade Union
Congress and rejected a perfectly feasible
attempt to bring about an industrial truce;
it was .certainly mischievous in 1922, when
the A..W.U. went mad and there was a de-
lirious orgy of job-control and irritation-
strikes ; but in 1923 it has become merely
ridiculous—a feeble noise and a bad sm-eli.
When its agents started monkeying with the
A hite Australia policy they pronounced
their own doom Unfortunately the pathe-
tically _ imitative “moderate” Laborite —
pathetically imitative now, although there
used to be quite a vigorous Australian school
of political thought—feels lost without some-
one to think for him. In his extremity he is
turning to Britain for intellectual guidance.
The Labor party in that country has refused
to have anything to do with Bolshevism in
its violent aspects—repudiation, Red Army,
dictatorship of the proletariat, and so forth.
It has also expressed a dislike for bureau-
catic State socialism on the Australian
plan. But in other respects its head seems
to be as soft as its heart, to say nothing of
its hands. Consider its latest remarks about
peace and brudderly loye:—
Modern wars are mainly caused by the greed of
competing capitalist groups. We are in opposi-
t on to economic Imperialism, which seizes territory
and exploits it in the interests of profiteers. We
advocate a. world organisation of free peoples, co-
operating in the production and distribution of the
world’s goods. We recognise that the interests of
the workers throughout the world, of whatever color,
race or creed, are one, and that the socialist common-
wealth must ultimately be international. We
believe in total disarmament. How else can the world
be saved from the miseries of poverty and of war?
That fustian may do for Little Puddleton,
but it won’t go down in this country. The
White Australia doctrine is in hopeless
conflict with the idea of an international
socialist commonwealth. The Australian
worker can never admit that his interests are
identical with those of tiie Asiatic eoolie,
who, if the barriers were removed, would
seize his job and sap the purity of his race.
And, since the worker has more to gain by
the enforcement of the national policy than
any other member of the family, it is impos-
sible for him to leave it defenceless, which is
what total disarmament would mean. Of
course, there are workers who demand the
benefits of the White Australia policy and
repudiate the obligations it imposes on them,
the first of which is to contribute their share
towards the cost of an adequate army and
navy. There are Labor politicians who ex-
pend quantities of gas and writing material
in inept attempts to reconcile the irrecon-
cilable —to square their passion for race-
purity with their craze for total disarma-
ment, their alleged Australianism with advo-
cacy of the international State. All such
persons are imbeciles or impostors. Some
are both.
Better to Reign in Hell.
The Home of the Upside-Downs is the new
Russia, where there are Soviets and savages
and slaves, and the anthropophagi are at
large, and nothing happens but the unex-
pected and the ought-not-to. Thus it
chanced that on the same recent day
(10/3/’23) two items drifted along from
the country which is the model and Mecca
of our imported Garden and Walsh, and
our mostly-imported Labor extremists in
general:—
The London secretary to the American Relief
Administration states that the mass feeding they
are carrying out in Russia will be continued till
the next harvest. Conditions and prices in Russia
have so much improved that it will be unnecessary
to continue operations, at any rate after April. Last
summer the Administration fed 11,000,000 (eleven
million) people daily; medically treated 50,000,000
(fifty million) and equipped 11,000 hospitals. At
the present time 3,000,000 adults and children are
being fed daily.
The Soviet has ordered 3,000,000 rifles from
Sweden and Germany, 125,000 machine guns from
Ozecho-Slovakia, and 40 aeroplanes from Sweden.
The first item is an incredible picture of
hunger, disease, misery, the boundless in-
capacity and heartless muddle of self-
appointed rulers, and the wreckage of civilisa-
tion. ; (Soviet Russia is still a spacious land.
It is fertile, very fai*’ from crowded, and its
last little civil war flickered out long ago.
It has no interest bill to pay, having repudi-
ated its debts, along with its expensive royal-
ties and aristocracy. Yet a recent report
was to the effect that the population had
diminished by over 2U millions under the new
regime, hunger and disease having eaten up
the natural increase and that much in addi-
tion. The plain account, issued by the
biggest charity organisation of the age, or of
many ages, as to what the land is line under
its “improved” conditions, corroborates other
narratives. In the Home of the Upside-
Downs the yoting power, whatever it may
be worth, has been vested, for nearly five
years, in artisans, peasants and soldiers.
The men of learned and peaceful profes-
sions, being disqualified along with the lower
animals, and given the most meagre rations,
gradually disappeared. The artisans are
the rather inferior Russian class, further
depreciated by the fact that the Men Who
Knew How have been mostly killed or chased
away as minions of oppression, leaving con-
trol to Those Who Didn’t Know How. The
peasants are the folk who decided early that
it was waste labor to grow surplus grain
for sale, because only the Government was
allowed to buy', and the Government paid
its own price in its own rag money. When
the bucolics cut the margin too fine famine
naturally followed. The soldiers are a
vast crowd —on paper, anyhow—for Soviet
Russia has the biggest paper army on earth.
They are one of the three privileged voting
and ruling castes, which is Upside-Down as
usual, for in other countries the tendency
is rather to disfranchise the soldier during
his term of service. With this difference
the military Muscovite is probably the same
as other soldiers, only a good deal worse.
The incessant reports about the purchase of
arms and about preparations for war (the
second cablegram quoted is one of many)
arise probably from various causes. (1)
It is advisable for the Government to make
a reputation which will not only overawe
its own people, but force foreigners to treat
it with more respect. (2) It is good busi-
ness if the army can live at other people’s
expense for a while, and possibly declare a
dividend when it comes home. (3) It is
necessary to give a big army work to do
now and then, lest it should become morbid,
like old Rome’s Praetorian Guard, and take
to king-making. Russia has been a sorry
example of prohibition for some years, but
the Government has gone back to drink, in
order to raise funds for war. The fact
that this haunted land of Upside-Down is
the ideal of the worst class of Australian
political adventurer is nothing to marvel at.
If this country could be made another Rus-
sia, that would be the one great chance for
its Gardens and Walshes and Donald
Grants to become small emperors, by the
disqualification of everybody who was the
intellectual superior of Garden or Walsh
or Donald Grant. Even if they couldn’t
qualify as artisans, peasants or soldiers
that need be no barrier. The men who
seized and retained power in Russia were
the sprig of nobility— Ulianoff, alias
Lenin, and the literary chemist, Trotsky.
Then they disqualified their kind to prevent
competition. It is better to reign in Hell
than serve in Heaven. But somebody has
to suffer when it is necessary to make the
hell first.

Arcades Ambo.
Dooley, who has been expelled from the
N.S.W. Labor party, but refuses to admit it,
scored a point last week by digging up a
report in which McGirk, the other faction
leader, was discussed by the bosses of the
party executive. The report, which was
presented to the June Labor conference, deals
with an allegation that the late John
Storey and several of his Ministers con-
templated coalescing with the Nationalists,
and states (1) that the charge was baseless
and (2) that the man who made it “in this,
as in other matters, has proved that his
word is Worthless.” The alienator was
McGirr, and among his judges were
Power, president of the A.L.P., and Hut-
chison, a member of the executive. It is
notorious that no two men have been more
active in k cking Dooley out and replacing
him wuth the person whom, nine months ago,
they found guilty of the worst sort of men-
da city and disloyalty to his colleagues. Fol-
lowing on the supremely foolish effort to
gag critics by the threat of instant expul-
sion, this has caused another severe slump
in the executive’s stocks. For monstrous
impudence and intolerance the instruction
to “all branches, councils and members,”
Labor editors included, that they must not
discuss the expulsion of Dooley (the
McGirrites were allowed full liberty of dis-
cussion) has no parallel in modern history.
Nothing so tyrannical was attempted even
by W. M. Hughes under his infamous War
Precautions Act. But there is a strong in-
fusion of humbug in the remonstrances of
the Dooley brigade. Their alleged regard
for freedom of speech was successfully con-
cealed in 1916, when scores of good Labor-
ites were “automatically placed outside the
movement” tor expressing their belief in.
equality of sacrifice when the nation was
battling for its life. None more enthusiastic
for expulsion in those days than the gentry
who are bursting with indignation because
they have been expelled themselves! Also,
not one. of these impassioned anostles of free
speech is recorded to have protested against
Power’s threat, made at the June confer-
ence, that Labor would some day issue an
ultimatum to the Sydney daily papers, and
in default of compliance they would be shut
up “in 24 hours.” The apostles are quite
vociferous in asserting that “freedom of
speech is one of the basic principles of our
Movement.” Evidently the “principle” is
worked in much the same way as the sliding
panels of those ballot-boxes on which Dooley
has lately dw r elt.
Pap for the South Coast.
A crowd of politicians has been pervading
the N.S.W. South Coast, and this was part
of the newspaper report from Twofold Bay:
The visiting party.... lifted the veil from a won-
drous picture of the future of Twofold Bay and Eden.
They were the guests of the Twofold Bay Develop-
ment League at a banquet, and in after-dinner speeches
quite stole their hosts’ thunder. They told of the
great developments that await the port as a trading
and industrial centre, with advantages second 10
none on the eastern coast. There was nothing left
for the hosts to say—no case left for them to advo-
cate as to why this inimitable port of Nat. re's mak-
ing, and its productive hinterland, should have the
consideration and assistance of Government to enter
into its rightful heritage....
Mr. Austin Chapman ... .envisaged Paradise re-
gained and Eden roused from its lethargy by electric
energy generated on the Snowy River, to which
Twofold Bay was the nearest port.
Mr. Joseph Carruthers affirmed that he was lost
in admiration of Twofold Bay as one of the Pearls
of Australia. It stood without a rival in the Com-
monwealth for the depth of its waters right up to the
shore.... Under the Snowy River electric scheme
power would be carried to Sydney at one-twentieth
its present cost."
From this it is inferred that Twofold Bay
is as good a port as the capital’s, with the
advantage of splend.d water-power at its
door, which Sydney lacks. It remains a
paralysed hamlet for want of what Sydney
has—a railway and some roads to connect
it with its hinterland. The plausible visi-
tors might have promised their whole influ-
ence to get the long-ehefished little gap in
the railway filled in, or to let local or pri-
vate enterprise fill it in, so as to end the
isolation, and after that to get the Bay a
harbor board, that it might work out its
own destiny. They did not. Something
was said about Victoria connecting its little
eastern patch, between the mountains and
the sea, with Twofold Bay, if Victoria felt
inclined, but the Monaro (N.S.W.) trade is
still, it would seem, to take the long road
to Sydney. Something was also said about
annexing the district’s best hope, its cheap
hydro-electric power, and transmitting that
to Sydney, so that the city, which already
holds five-sevenths of the State’s factory
operatives, might become the only possible
factory site and take over the rest. Then
it would have still more population, though
it is already so crowded that an agent the
other day let “an old cottage of two rooms
and kitchen, no laundry or bath, with only a
back-lane approach, situate at rear of a
larger building, at 30s. a week rent.” It
seems more and more unlikely that any Gov-
ernment at the old address will" ever fill in
the gaps which keep Twofold Bay, Jervis Bay
and Port Stephens from railway communica-
tion, or join Jervis Bay and Goulburn, or link
northern ports with their inland country, or
finish the lines that break off at Kyogle and
Murwillumbah, or complete the Binnaway-
Werris Creek section (which would enable
the West and North to trade by a shorter
road than via Sydney), or let any outport
manage its own affairs by its own harbor
board. All the pap spoonfed to the South
Coasters is merely a further argument for
subdivision of the unwieldy State which has
fallen too completely under the domination
of the One Great City.
The N.S.W. Prison System.
“J.H.M.A.” has a last word :
If you start from the 22nd line from the bottom
in “2nd Divvy’s” statements (B. 22/3/’23), thus
leaving out the “eyewash” remarks and the inevitable
aeqounts of his war experiences, I think you will find
that he has only made his case worse. Of course, the
“opportunities” for such infamies as he describes as
existing in Wandsworth exist here. But he seems
to forget that Wandsworth, at the time he writes
of, was a military prison, that the only severer sort
existing in the Empire is a naval one, and that there
should be no comparison at all between those sorts
and a civil gaol. And if “2nd Divvy” can’t pos-
sibly understand how discipline in any decently-
conducted prison could fail to be affected by the
casual visits of “societies”—Prison Reform or other
kinds —all I can say about him is that he failed dis-
mally in appreciating the lessons that he should have
learned in the famous and gallant Divisional unit in
which he served in the late war. The Mutiny at the
Nore in 1797 concerned much more than rotten meat
—the incompetence and villainy of one or two R.N.
captains, for instance. And it was also somewhat
of a disadvantage to the A.I.F. that it didn’t enjoy
the death penalty. Twenty-odd years ago just as
good Australians were up against it —though, of
course, shell-shock hadn’t been invented then, even if
one does know of more than one case that might have
been it. One hopes that while the N.S.W. prison
system goes on as well as it is doing—but nor
otherwise —it may, with your permission, get “the
apologetics of people like “J.H.M.A.’ ”
And Grant Hervey writes: —
May I bring before you one of the most serious
aspects of our prison-reform problem, viz., the treat-
ment of the boy prisoner? Let me cite from the
S. M. Herald (24/3/’23) the following case:—
Herbert Frank Yates, aged 161, was called up
for sentence on a charge of larceny, and was sen-
teneed to 18 months’ hard labor in Goulburn Gaol.
“It is futile,” said his Honor, “again to send Yates
to the Prison Farm for boys, as he has refused to
submit to discipline.” The police evidence showed
that Yates had attempted to use an axe against the
superintendent of the farm. Fourteen prior convic-
tions were read against the lad. On 12 occasions
he had been sent to State homes, and on various occa-
sions had escaped. His first offence was committed
44 years ago.
The boy is 161 years of age. During the past 44
yeara 14 “convictions” have been recorded against
him, and he has been sent to various State “homes,”
including the Prison Farm at Emu Plains, no less
than 12 times. Now, finally, presiding Judge White
says it is futile to send him to the Prison Farm
again; and so he “solves” the problem by sen-
tencing him to 18 months’ hard labor.
Judge White assumes that the Prison Farm at
Emu Plains is perfect, and that, if the thing fails
in a specific case, then it is the toy that is at
fault. He is especially certain to assume that it',
as in this case, the boy attempts to use an axe
against the superintendent. Now, I have never visited
Emu Plains. But I spent 11 months, as a prisoner,
at Tuneurry Afforestation Camp ; and I can magine
conditions at Emu Plains, in the right of my own
experience as a man, which might drive any boy
to homicide. Our work, in the middle of summer,
consisted in felling trees up to 8 and 10 feet in
diameter. We worked at this, with the axe, stark
naked, exactly after the fashion of Indian coolies.
For breakfast we received a dish of hominy and
a piece of bread. This meant that by 10 o’clock
the last ounce of energy had been burnt out of a
man. For the next two hours, i.e., from 10 to 12,
he consumed himself. Then, at 12 o’clock, we
tramped back to camp, where we received
a scanty dish of beef. One day I went
to the officer in charge with my dish. 1
pointed opt the abominable things that were fester-
ing in my food. The officer simply said: “Keep
dem until dev grow an inch long. Den bring dem
back again.” With that he turned upon his heel.
That afternoon every prisoner in the camp downed
tools and refused to work. Flesh and blood could
not stand any more. Inside a week Comptroller-
General McCauley sent up Mr. Joseph Manning,
one of the very best men in the service, to replace
the other. After that we got better conditions, new
boots and clothes, and some decent food.
My point is, with regard to boy-prisoners, that
the capable official Joe Mannings are in a small
minority, and that the prison service is alive with
hostile and futile men. One warder at Tuneurry,
for instance, found his daily amusement in poison-
ing small lizards with pipe-nicotine, and in chopping
off the legs of gohannas with an axe. In both cases
it was his delight to watch the victims squirm.
Personally, I asked not to be sent with his gang.
Had f worked there I should most infallibly have
made some attempt to murder him; and then, no
doubt, somebody like Judge White, quite certain
that things at Tuneurry Prison Camp were in per-
fect order,- would have sentenced me to death oi-
ls years in Bathurst prison.
As for the boys’ drill, that, as a sort of crowning
mercy, is mostly carried out under the direction of
Germans. For, curiously enough, whilst good and
useful Germans were fired out of employment : n
almost every other walk *of life, those in the N. S.
Wales Prisons Department have maintained a firm
grip of official existence. During my two years at
Goulburn, from August, 1915, to 1917, out of some
50 or 60 warders, I know of only one—old Conway,
a fine man—who volunteered for war service. I
asked one why he did not go to the war. He answered
with amazing candor: “Because I am too big a ——•
coward, and because it is safer here, scaring
out of kids.” The moral of the prison service, as
a whole, may be guessed from that. As things
stand, the best men in the service are driven to
resign. Gardiner, the best working overseer that
ever saw Tuneurry, chucked the job in despair.
There is too much everlasting crawl business to the
Departmental bosses; too much under-feeding and
over-working of coolie prisoners; in a word, too
much Prussian shadow of Neitenstein. I could
name about a dozen first-class men, whom every
decent prisoner respected and obeyed implicitly, who
have abandoned their jobs. While the average grown
man in gaol has his sheer physical strength and
knowledge of the world, in an emergency, to fall
back upon, a boy-prisoner has not. He is under-
fed, browbeaten, cowed and bullied, cursed at and
not infrequently kicked, from start to finish. Placed
in such an environment, so uniformly grey and dis-
couraging ; clothed like a cross between a monkey
and a pauper idiot of Bumble's time; roared at from
morning until night—is it any wonder that the boy-
prisoner so often becomes to-morrow’s habitual
crook?
A Boy’s Trade.
Dear Bulletin, —Like many others, I am
often asked to get jobs for men who did
brilliantly in the A.1.F., not only in the
trenches but in responsible staff billets.
Most of them are pathetically willing to take
almost any position, with a preference for
something in the clerical line that does not
carry too much responsibility. They learnt
little but soldiering during the war, and
as soldiering, even on active service, is about
one part mental concentration and nine parts
mental inertia, they are not fitted now for a
career requiring strong mental effort. An
ex-major of my old brigade has been strug-
gling for about four years with the Bar
exams., and one of the most capable young
adjutants I ever knew has failed a couple
of times in solicitors’ exams. Yet they were
admirable soldiers. By the end of the war
all the armies had youngsters of this type,
who, while nominally majors, were doing the
work of colonels and even brigadiers, and
doing it well. Under peace conditions it
takes a newly-joined subaltern about 80
years to attain a rank qualifying him to con-
trol a brigade—the same time approximately
as it takes a barrister to become a Judge.
Another odd feature of the war was that,
with very few exceptions, the men who were
colonels or brigadiers in 1914 were colonels
or brigadiers when the Armistice came, and
—where they are not dead—they hold the
same rank still. A few sought fame in the
cannon’s mouth, only to be immediately out-
classed at their own game by youthful ex-
civilians ; but the majority were sensible
enough to take base or transport jobs and
stay in them. In short, soldiering is essen-
tially a trade for the young, and, what is
more, the very young. In my opinion it
should be a part of every school’s daily
curriculum. A lad with a taste for a sol-
dier’s life would show it in such circum-
stances by the time lie was 15 or so. On
leaving school he would be drafted into units
commanded by youngsters of between 20 and
25, this being the period of their lives in
which many A.I.F. officers did their best
work. While enjoying themselves in bar-
racks, forts or camp—and to the born soldier
this life of picnic and pageantry is extremely
enjoyable—the State would see that its de-

fenders were taught trades or enabled to
qualify for professions on being automatically
superannuated at 25. A State department
(non-military) would issue stores and attend
to the pay and other business details which
soldier business-men have always bungled.
The advantages of such a system to the State,
by comparison with the present one, which
has been evolved by elderly soldiers for their
own benefit, are manifold. It would do away
with all questions of pensions or long-service
gratuities, the State having compensated the
soldier in the best possible way by providing
him with a trade or profession. " The com-
munity would be relieved of that most useless
of encumbrances, the “retired” professional
soldier. If war came the arrangement would
ensure, in the first place, a ready-made
supply of fit young officers and n.c.o.’s —an
active-service necessity which in the last war,
:i ? IP previous wars, had to be trained hur-
riedly by old and medically unfit officers and
n.c.o.’s—and, in the second place, it would
provide a first reserve of fighting men under
30, and. a second reserve of almost equally
well-trained men under 35. Since we are
now at peace, this proposal is bound to be
fiercely objected to by old soldiers who have
almost forgotten that, when the last war
came, they hastened to let juniors do their
jobs. But its justification remains in the
oft-proven fact that soldiering is a profes-
sion for the young, and—with the inevitable
handful of rule-proving exceptions—the
young alone. It is the only trade or pro-
fession in the world at which, as a class,
the sons can do 10 times better than their
fathers. —Yours, 2nd Divvy.
About Dago Affairs.
A letter with an ancient signature, though
the paper is modern:—
Dear Bulletin, —Speaking as a public character
who still has a regard for his country despite many
years of absence, I complain of the statement (B.
15/3/’23) that “at no period in the history of
Italy have more than a small percentage of the
population known freedom as we understand it.”
bet us see—provided there is light enough. The
early Australians left England when it was governed
by (I) a German king; (2) an hereditary House of
Landlords; and (3) a People’s House to which only
landlords could be elected, and in which the fran-
chise was so remarkable that in 1801 it was said
that 425 members were returned by 252 electors or
patrons.” Coming to Australia these early folk
lost their “self-governing” privileges, and didn’t
quite attain to “freedom as we understand it” till
the western half of the continent was blessed with
Responsible Government in 1890. Then one-sixth
of the country (the N.T.) lost its self-government and
sank back into the slough of personal or despotic
rule, also into material decay and partial anarchy.
Italy acquired its first Parliament (that of Sar-
dinia) in 1849, which was seven years before the
first Australian Parliament met. The electors were
few, chiefly because illiterates were excluded from
the franchise, but this evil tended to remedy itself.
Most of Italy joined up with Sardinia in 1860, not
by conquest but by referendum (Australia wasn’t
sufficiently advanced in a political or self-governing
way to have then), and the Parliament
of Most of Italy met about four years later than the
Legislatures of Australia’s eastern States, and 30
years ahead of the one at Perth. The annexation
of Rome made a real United Italy in 1870, and Aus-
tralia followed the good example 30 years later.
It seems to me that Australia was generally 30 years
later. ,
In Italy every man over 21 has a vote except
during his short term of military service, and so
has every woman. It is hardly possible to do more
than that. People on the roll number only 34 per
cent, of the jtopulation as compared with over 50
per cent, in Australia, but then the Italian isn't
absolutely chased on to the roll if he doesn’t take
the trouble to go there. The Italian Upper House
has been objected to, but there is nothing much
wrong with it. Barring nine princes, who are an
anomaly, the body consists of life members like
the N.S.W. Leg. Council. The qualifications are
paying £l2O in taxes, or holding some high and
honorable office, or “having acquired fame in science,
literature, or any other pursuit tending to the benefit
of the nation.” No party-machine nomination is re-
quired, nor is it necessary to be a member of a
Labor league, or a broken-down political hack who
has taken to drink.
In this Italy of small estates and peaceful govern-
ment the Communists or Bolsheviks broke loose
after the war. They had no popular mandate any
more than the Communists who burned about one-
third of Paris in 1871, or De Valera’s assassins, or
the thousand “extremists” with whom Garden and
co. run the Australian Labor movement. At the
pre-war election the Radicals, Socialists and Syndi-
calists (3) returned 150 members out of 508, and
the Radicals (70) had no murderous intentions. But
the Communists were inflated because of the success
with which a handful in Russia had torn up things
by the roots. They seized factories, drove away the
owners, and ran the industries on go-as-you-please
principles till there was no industry. They took
practical possession of towns, and proposed to put
the arrogant dictation of their own Councils of
Action in place of rule by universal suffrage. The
Government of the moment knew no more how to
deal with the situation than Kerensky did how to
deal with Lenin, or Ryan with the Townsville rioters,
or Hughes with the N. Territory “problem.” Italy
threatened to become like the chronically-besieged
and half-destroyed city of Cork; like a border dis-
trict of Russia, or like an ordinary province in
Asiatic Turkey, where there is no particular law
except what the local tyrant makes on the spur of
the moment.
Then the wonderful organisation of the Faseisti was
formed by a peaceful Milan editor, who was weary
of being jostled in the streets by the uncouth crooks,
many of them of Russian extraction, who had made
his town their headquarters. It grew amazingly,
and became the army of the people, the chief upholder
of the adult-suff'rage-made law, and a blessed source
of confidence to the terrorised Parliament. Probably
because its intelligence department was vastly
more efficient than that of the Irish Free State Gov-
ernment, it put down sabotage, outrages, general
strikes, confiscation of factories, and Councils of
Action with remarkably' little violence. Of course, it had
to be a sort of War Precautions Act unto itself,
but then there uas war. Now' Communist papers
have ceased publication in Italy'. Well, a paper
which advocates the destruction of a laboriously--
constructed civilisation, and gives directions how-
to do it by- scattering the germs of either anarchism
or cholera, should be made to cease—with an axe.
The idea that “popular freedom” includes freedom
to wipe out freedom was invented by anarchists for
anarchists.
And the Roman Church has given its approval to
Mussolini, though he is no very good son of the
Church, and to his black-shirted army. Somehow 1
don’t wonder. An outstanding episode of the Paris
Commune was the execution of Archbishop Darboy
THE CRIMINAL.
“It would not be a bad idea if pedestrians were fined for getting in the way of a car.”
— Mr. G. R. W. McDonald, M.L.C., at the annual meeting of the National Roads Association.
JOHN (to pedestrian who has “got in the way” of a car ): “Eh, now, if ye'll come
quietly. I’ll make it as easy as I can for ye. Being a first offender, ye’ll not

and a number of minor clerics. The Communists in
Russia didn’t give the local church much of a time.
The Pope and cardinals were just beginning to
wonder what their uncomfortable end would be at
the hands of a new Commune when the Milan editor
took an active part in the game. Why shouldn't
they be grateful?—Yours, Pontius Pilate.
There isn’t much hope that the question of
German reparations will ever be settled
until the value of the mark is fixed. There
used to be 20 marks to the £; the value is
now about 100,000 to the £. Fix it by law
at 50,000 to the £, and the German debt,
mostly internal, and apart from reparations,
will be reduced from about £5,600,000,000
to l-2500th of that amount. In other words,
every German who had advanced money to
the State, or deposited money in a bank,
or lent on mortgage would lose 2499 out of
every 2500 marks. It may be a big penalty
to impose; but actually he will be no worse
off than he is now. The cancellation of this
debt will clear an enormous amount of Ger-
man visible and invisible property and make
it available for further pledging. With that
security at command a huge foreign loan
could be raised and payment made to the
Allies. Of course, Germany doesn’t want
to pay: and it will not pay until the Allies
and the U.S.A. agree upon a scheme by
which it can pay, and agree further that
there w'ili be no trade with Germany until
the scheme is accepted.
A Hugheselieb bobs up again:
Jens August Jensen is enjoying himself in ibe
Speck Assembly. Being the only Independent .in
the House he is able to keep both the regular parties
guessing as to where his next shell will explode.
His policy is evidently to greet all allusions to
his Federal past with a shrug and a smile, from
whichever side of the chamber they come, and stick
to his task of' keeping Jensen in the limelight.
Neither open denunciation by Labor men nor the
playful irony of Gnashers has any visible effect upon
his urbane attention to his job. Like most political
Ishmaelites Jensen is an alert and energetic forager,
and bus an unerring nose for political scandals.
The ether day be rooted out some figures from the
Auditor-General’s department showing that the
State’s prospective loss on soldier settlement was
quarter-Qf-a-million. He accused the Government of
hushing up these figures, and suggested that a recent
financial statement issued by Treasurer Lee was mis-
leading, inasmuch as the inevitable loss of between
£50,000 and £60,000 a year for the next four
years was not set forth or provided for. Moreover,
he gave a hint of further figures, of a still more
gloomy nature, which he hourly expected to receive
from the Auditor-General’s department. This last
announcement probably prevented Ministers from
formally replying to the allegations on the spot,
and gave the allegator time to sample his fresh
ammunition. Apparently the sampling was satisfac-
tory, for when the House met next day Premier
Hayes took delivery from Opposition-leader Lyons
of a no-confidence motion, so worded as to leave no
doubt as to the real originator of the shindy. The
motion alleged as reasons for the lack of confidence
“incompetent and improper management of the
finances of the State by Ministers, and the presenta-
tion to Parliament of a misleading statement in
regard to the financial position.’’ The House imme-
diately adjourned, and within five minutes everybody
knew that Jensen had interviewed Lyons just before
the House met and suggested that the leader of the
Opposition should take his (Jensen’s) ammunition
and use it on the Treasury benches. If Lyons was
not prepared to take the job on, well, Jexsek would
do it himself. So there you are. The motion met
with the customary fate, but it was the leader of
the Independent party of one, not the leaders oi
the orthodox and duly authorised mobs of fervid
contradictors, who mopped up most of the advertising
space.
Briefly, the Tasmanian position is that the
revenue for the last eight months shows such
a falling-off that Treasurer Bee estimates
the deficit at the end of June will be, not
£70,000, as predicted in October last, but
something like £lOO,OOO. To square the
accounts it will be necessary for Parlia-
ment to agree to every one of the Govern-
ment’s finance proposals, which include in-
come-tax increases £40,000, land-tax in-
creases £20,000, and various cheeseparings,
£lO,OOO. It seems probable that, unless the
Labor Opposition can bring off a coup, the
proposals will go through the Assembly, but
there is considerable doubt as to then
acceptability to the Other Place. In view
of recent rampageous remarks of the Lords
when unavailingly invited to agree to a few
thousand pounds’ worth of more or less
necessary public works, it is likely that the
Assembly’s methods of squaring the ledger
will meet with assault and battery on the
very threshold of the House of Review. The
IS Irate Old Gentlemen are pretty sure to
disagree with Lee’s suggestion that new taxa-
tion shall be six times the amount of the
cheeseparings, and may order him to cut 6ut
the proposed land-tax of £2O,(XX) and sack
civil servants and reduce the education vot*
to that amount. There is no manner of
doubt whatever that the Cocky party in the
Assembly would urge upon the Government
the quiet acceptance of such an Upper-House
dictum. As things are shaping, it really
looks as if the llayes-Lee crowd must soon
forfeit the last shred of its self-respect or
seriously fight the Other Place.
•
“Hair Splitter”: Some Sydney SAP’s,
especially of the new crop, seem desperately
anxious to make the public less intolerant of
having laymen on the bench. At Ashfield
the other day a Croydon publican was
charged with supplying intoxicants to two
Solomon Islanders. The Act forbids the
sale of liquor to the colored races except in
sickness or accident. The hotelkeeper
admitted the sale and the colored men ad-
rnitted that they were born in the Solomons.
But counsel took the point that no man
knows where he was born and that proof
can only be established by his mother or
by a birth certificate ; and, the S.M. uphold-
ing the point, the case was dismissed. This
decision makes me a more ignorant person
than I thought I was. I don’t know that
there are Solomon Islands: I have never
seen them. I don’t know that the sun rises
now: it is months since I saw it perform
the miracle. I don’t even know that an
S.M. sits at Ashfield. But if one should
do so in future, I hope he will take his
commonsense on to the bench with him and
see if he can’t make the law square with
it.
A grandiose idea which should be encour-
aged to the limit and beyond is the recon-
struction of Turkish Asia with United States
capital. The story has been told in many
ways, but the London Daily Express cor-
respondent at Constantinople put it tersely:
The simple Turk is greatly interested in a com-
prehensive American scheme for the reconstruction
of Turkey. The plan includes the transformation
of Angora into a dream city, embodying the out-
standing features of London, Paris, New York and
Washington. The syndicate also proposes to run
sugar refineries, plant trees, build a network of
railways, roads and bridges; construct canals for
irrigation, create schools of agriculture and engineer-
ing, establish health centres and hotels, and form
tourist travel companies. This is merely a summary
of the scheme. The all-embracing trust’s tentacles
will reach to uttermost Anatolia One hundred
and fifty members of U.S. Chambers of Commerce
have already arrived at Constantinople.
It will be good to see the Yankee bringing
back to the Old World some of the dollars
he has taken away from it, and setting his
breezy complacency up against the dead wail
of Ottoman stodge. The job of reforming
Abdul is a large and honorable one, and the
U.S. deserves to have it. If it can set up
a massive wall of Yankee financial interests
and cocktails between the Mohammedan
population of India and the Caliph at Con-
stantinople, there will be thus a third party
to share the heat and burden of the row,
when there it a row—and the British cer-
tainly don’t want to keep all the row to
themselves. And supposing, in the course
of the great mix-up, Uncle Sam
is forced at last to annex Turkish Asia, why
shouldn’t he have it? Also, for that matter.
Persia, Afghanistan, Tartary, and as much
of Western China as he cares to struggle
with? There will in those days be a pano-
rama of bustle in the old parts which it will
gladden the heart to witness.

POLITICAL
POINTS
First of all a cow-headed Fate put Senator
Pearce, an ordinary but persistent mortal,
into the new Federal Ministry, it being his
eighth Ministry and his ninth portfolio. Then
it gave him a job which is even more beyond
his calibre than most jobs—the one which
includes the Northern Territory. The first
thing to be done for the N.T. is to declare
that practically everything which was done
to the place during lOi years of Hughes-
Pearce management was wrong, and to
scrap it and begin afresh. But the Minister
isn’t game to talk like that of himself and his
reliable patron. So Pearce has to keep up
the pose that the North isn’t an ordinary
place which merely wants commonsense
treatment, but is the world’s great mystery,
vice the South Pole, disqualified. Therefore
he proposes to look at the property, and appa-
rently he isn’t going by the straight route
which the railway is to follow, but round by
Queensland, where Theodore will “see” him,
as he used to “see” Hughes, about making
a Federal railway through Theodore’s own
State, instead of the one in the contract.
Bruce, Prime Minister, talking at the
Show in Sydney, said drought wasn’t such a
bad thing, after all—it had its good points
and was never everywhere at the same time,
anyhow. Quite true. Every drought hits in-
dividuals with appalling hardships; but the
country could pull through the worst of them
all right—if it wasn’t for its politicians. The
political boomsters get to work, occasionally
lining their pockets, but oftener merely buy-
ing votes; heavy public borrowings send pri-
vate persons on the same sort of spree, de-
ceived by the. bogus prosperity which every
borrowing boom produces; then a drought
which shouldn’t really matter much suddenly
dries up the loan springs, and when the cry
of the consequent unemployed is raised, public
and private creditors get uneasy, prices
tumble, and good men and bad are buried
under the wreckage. A parson at Sydney’s
Day of Prayer said we should give thanks
to Gcd and dam the rivers. But the hard-
borrowing- politicians want damning more.
Ex-Salvationist Bruntnell, who is now a
N.S.W. Minister, has made a “candid state-
ment” concerning the State railways: —
The railways and tramways were directly and
absolutely under the control of the Commissioner.
While the Ministry might express to the Commissioner
what its wishes were, he had the right to do as he
thought fit. If they could get a man who had first-
class commercial and business experience in charge
of their railways, even if they had to pay him
£lO,OOO a year, it would be an economical thing
to do. They would then probably get a better service.
Yes, the Commissioner is a despot and an
autocrat, except for a few trifles: —
(1) He can’t fix wages. They are regulated by a
Court created and appointed by political Brvnt-
NELI.S, and the Court more than doubled the basic
rate inside 10 years.
(2) He can’t prevent a Cabinet borrowing money
on his Department’s account at rates which he
simply can’t earn.
(3) He can’t prevent people like Bruntxell load-
ing him with new lines that he doesn’t want, built
for their own political ends.
(4) He can’t get lines that he does want.
(5) It is fairly certain that startling things would
happen to him if he took the logical course, and
closed the most hopeless railways offhand.
In short, Bruntnell’s yarn is so far from
the truth that it amounts to a blot on the big
drum and a stain on the tambourine.
The Bulletin’s old friend louseph Ward,
who has been out of M.L. politics since the
khaki election, tried to return last week by
way of Tauranga, the late Bill Herries’s old
seat. A win for Ward would have compelled
the Massey Government to go to the country
again, and Farmer Bill fought like 17 wild-
cats to preserve his scraped-up majority. In
the result louseph was beaten rather easily.
It was his expiring flutter in public life, for
he will be 66 on April i:6. They don’t come
back.
The Newcastle (N.S.W.) miners, who are
on the bread line while their neighbors of
Maitland are affluent and arrogant, have
appealed to the Commonwealth Government
to do something for them. Naturally it
doesn’t know what it can do. In their des-
peration they suggest a coal pool, and men-
tion the wheat pool as a precedent. But
those two horses are not the same color.
The object of the wheat pool was not to
take a slice out of the cake of the farmer
on good land to give to the farmer on poor
land; and that is what the advocates of a
coal pool want. There is only one thing
for the Newcastle miners to do—either turn
to the fields where the more profitable mines
are, or look for some other kind of toil. But
Whether they have made the best of a bad
job at Newcastle is another matter.
Premier Lawson, of Victoria, who has been
congratulating Mussolini in Rome, will soon
yearn for some of the Fascist’s summary
methods of dealing with intriguers. Abbott,
M.L.C., fired the first shot in the Lawson-
Must-Go campaign, and other guns are about
to be trained on the Ministry. Ominous also
is the disposition of Ministerial followers
tc charge heavily for their support. There
is Deany, M.L.A. for Warrnambool, who
wants £60,000 for port improvements in his
constituency. He doesn’t say openly that
this is the price of his vote, but he threatens
to be a terrible fellow if the Government
confines its expenditure On his favorite port
to the £300,000 already allotted.
THE OXFORD MANNER.
“Mr. Bruce prefers that vital matters of Defence shall stand over until after the Imperial Conference.”
BRUCE: “How dare you enter without knocking? So beastly crude and uncouth of you
it simply isn't done, you know’.”
Priminister Bruce has been “severely re-
proving” those people who have been crying
about drought and disaster. The words
would be naturally hateful to any Priminis-
ter with as many loans _ to renew within a
year as Bruce is faced with. It is the inevi-
table and horrible result of the absence of a
substantial sinking fund. The country, while
it habitually promises to pay, makes no pro-
vision for paying, and, since it must there-
fore either borrow or burst, is utterly at
the mercy of the conditions which happen to
exist at the moment the lOU falls due.
South Aus. has been alleged to be worry-
ing because it was the only State without a
formal coat-of-arms. Barwell went into the
matter in London last year, and the College
of Arms has fixed up an elaborate device.
Minerva (Wisdom) faces Ceres (Plenty) ;
between them is a shield bearing wheat-
sheaves and a flaming sun; above, a lion
supports a Southern Cross flag. The motto
suggested is “Faith and Works.” As S..
Australia’s debt has just reached £lOO per
head-man, woman and child —and as the
mortgage is added to every year, Ceres ought
at any rate to be clothed in rags. And, to
give a practical hint as to the best way to
produce the wheat-sheaves, the “Faith and
Works" should give place to “Fallowing
and Manure.” S. Aus. would then have
something distinctive, anyway.
Under the present U.S. immigration law
only 3 p.c. of the number of Australians
resident in that country at the 1910 census
are annually admitted as settlers. Those who
exceed the 3 p.c. are sent back to where they
came from or hustled into Canada. Some
have been confined in nasty immigration pens
which are, to all intents and purposes, gaols.
It is proposed to amend the law by reducing
the percentage to 2, and making the 1890
census the standard, in which case the
yearly influx of intending settlers from this
part of the world would be restricted to
about 70. One way of retaliating would be
to limit the imports of American Aims to
2 p.c. of the 1890 total. Not only would a
gratuitous insult be thereby avenged, but a
potentially great industry would be reserved
for Australian writers, actors, photographers,
carbon manufacturers and so forth; also, the
Australian kid would no longer be mentally
polluted by Los Angeles offal. Incidentally,
18,000,000 ft. of American films, the tax on
which is a joke, were allowed into Australia
last year. Even Canada was content with
8,000,000 ft.
For six months the engineering men of
Westralia were on strike against the arith-
metic book, what they sought to prove being
that 11 is as much as 12. In other words,
that if one-twelfth of the output, and con-
sequently of the revenue, was knocked off by
a one-twelfth reduction of working hours
with no corresponding reduction of expenses,
things could go on just the same. Whether
one-twelfth of the gross income was profit
or not didn’t matter. The other day the
arithmetic book won on points. It is a
fine question. In N.S.W., during 1921,
manufacturers, after paying for wages, fuel
and raw. materials, had 12-j p.c. and those
of S. Australia had lOf p.c. of their revenue
left. That was for rent, taxes, insurance,
commission, interest, discount, pow'er, light,
water, stationery, stamps, travelling ex-
penses, freight, repairs, purchase of new
plant, depreciation of old plant, advertising,
bad debts, wages of working partners (other
“wages” only mean payments to employees),
and sundries, including profit—if there was
any profit left. The Dooley Ministry said
lightly that a 44- or even a 40-liours’ week
was easy, and that the loss of another 8£
or 17 p.c. out of 12f p.c. wouldn’t be noticed.
And wagepayers like Sim Hickey, who knew'
that it is a strain to get 40s. out of £l, be-
gan to fall under suspicion.
Only here and there does a man achieve
the distinction of being the sort of man that
everybody objects to but himself, and N.S.W.
Labor politician McGirr hasn’t quite dore
it yet. Still, he has made progress. Mem-
bers of the minority which followed him out
of the Caucus room explain that they went,
not because they liked McGirr, but because
they considered themselves bound to obey
the executive. Members of the majority
which stayed with Dooley hint that they
remained, not that they loved Dooley much,
but that they objected to McGirr as much
as they could object to anybody. And the
executive, which now feels like a large ass,
has allow r ed it to leak out or be interred
that McGirr received the appointment be-
cause he was the only applicant —in other
words, the only man who would have the
job at the price.
One fantasy that Theodore, of Queens-
land, has harbored lately is that there is a
desperate demand for patchy coast lands
that are tucked away among the hills and
can only be unearthed by flooding four Oppo-
sition electorates with construction workers
to build railways or dams out of loan money,
the inevitable and recurring deficits to be
met by piratical taxation. Not even Iheo-
dore can say what will be produced—except-
ing deficits—and where it will be disposed
of. Brisbane, the only considerable market
for agricultural produce, is already being
supplied by hundreds of small farmers within
50 miles of the metropolis, and what will
happen to them when the cabbage trains
start to pour in from the Burnett and Daw-
son is not specified. But there is no idle
rumor about the land-hunger where the sol-
vent sheep keeps the taxation wolves at bay.
The men whose job it is to handle the ballot-
box when a morsel of real sheep-land is
being raffled or balloted for will testify to
that.
Massey intends next session to abolish the
oath of allegiance now required of British
subjects on returning to Maoriland. Angli-
can Archbishop Julius, just back from Aus-
tralia, was mightily wroth wnen, after hav-
ing been a Briton for 75 years, he had to
declare that he was still loyal at the end of
his fortnight’s absence from the Dominion.
Horrors still continue in Ireland. One
recent tragedy began with the arrival of a
report at a Free State barracks that a fire
had broken out, or a pot-plant blown down,
or something. A soldier was told to go along
and report, but being taken prisoner he
naturally failed to return. An officer and
another soldier went out to discover where
their wandering boy was to-night, and were
also gathered in. Apparently the rebels were
willing to take in the whole Free State
army by instalments, but as the supply
stopped there the three already bagged were
taken away and shot. The killing of
prisoners of war is possibly explained away
on the ground that the fuss isn’t war, but
just chaos. And, of course, it isn’t to be
supposed that all the wild doings are on one
side. It was the same kind of war when
the British troops and the “black and tans’
were the enemy, and when the natives of
the soil were all rebels together, before Col-
lins and De Valera parted, and the first
became orthodox, and the second became
more of a mad dog than ever.
An echo of the Labor split during the war
has been heard at Murray Bridge (S.A.).
Parish, who used to be a member for the
district in S.A. Assembly, is after the party
nomination for the next election. He has
been formally turned down, like all the other
Labor conscriptionists except a few in W.A.,
but he is so popular with the strong railway
element at Murray Bridge that a special
appeal is being made in his interest. The
result will be worth noting.
“Skyrider”: The most startling contribu-
tion to the Dooley-McGirr controversy ap-
peared in a Southern Tablelands (N.S.W.)
paper. After the Paddington Labor League
had been declared bogus, or decrepit, or what-
ever the term is, the organ came out with
the heading “Spit on the Labor Party.”
Tracked to his sanctum by a scowling
A.W.U. deputation, the editor politely ex-
plained that he had written “split in” in-
stead of the offending words. Bloodshed was
thus averted.
“Harold Hardupp” : The almighty A.L.P.
Executive in Sydney is as obsequious to rich
Laborites as it is overbearing to such as
haven’t a feather to fly with. McGirr ignores
or defies the executive when it suits his pur-
pose. So does the wealthy Minahan, with
like immunity. The executive’s devotion to
Minahan is one of the mysteries of N.S.W.
Labor politics. When E. W. O’Sullivan died
the Belmore P.L.L. selected Aid. John Eng-
lish to run for the seat. For some inscru-
table reason the executive declined _to en-
dorse English, and gave the nomination to
Minahan, then its president. On the Bel-
more league protesting it was. hastily de-
clared bogus. At the 1920 election Minahan
fell out with his party apropos of the
I.W.W. prisoners, and won his seat as an
Independent. Unlike Scott Campbell, who
adopted precisely the same attitude, he was
promptly forgiven. But, then, Scott Camp-
bell isn’t a gilded boot manufacturer.

So England’s might shall vanish in its turn.
Within its base like tunnelling termites work
In massed battalions armies of despair.

This co. mixes shipping and coal, but does
not run a single steamer or produce a ton
of coal on its own account. It is a holding
concern only: it owns most of the shares in
Caledonian Collieries, and is sole proprietor
of Australian Steamships, Ltd. The former,
owing to holdings outside Howard Smith’s,
publishes accounts regularly each year, but
they say as little as the Companies Act will
allow. Australian Steamships, Ltd., gives
the public no glimpse of its affairs. Howard
Smith’s earnings are made up of (1) divs.
from these two cos. and whatever other in-
terests are included in the balance-sheet
entry, “Shares in other cos. at valuation,
£2,447,637”; (2) interest earnings from
Government stocks and other debentures,
£24,500; (3) rent from office premises;
and (4) commissions, etc., for acting as
managing-agents for the steamship concern
and distributor for the collieries. Disclosed
profits depend, therefore, on how much
Howard Smith directors decide to extract
from the subsidiaries, and no information
whatever is available of the profits left be-
hind. Caledonian Collieries’ accounts do not
disclose any large storage of profits, never-
theless there may be much that is not visible.
So far that coal concern, though a big pro-
ducer, is to some extent still at the develop-
ment stage. Anyway, the Greta properties
are among the best coal propositions of N..
S. Wales, and their future, under Howard
Smith auspices, can be expected to glitter.
Besides the divs. which Australian Steam-
ships has passed over, the parent co. three
years ago was presented with a half-million
or so of gift scrip. No doubt that co. did
very well during the war period, particularly
by selling some of its steamers at boom prices.
But the public is entirely in the dark as to
the actual health of the subsidiaries.
During the past year, after prolonged de-
lays due to legal difficulties, Howard Smith’s
returned the whole of the half-million of
pref. capital which it had employed for many
years. The real reasons which prompted
the directors to repay this cheap capital—
it carried only 6 p.c.—have not been dis-
closed. Evidently they were thoroughly
satisfied that, though the parent co. did not
show much loose cash, ample funds were
within reach elsewhere. This return of capi-
tal suggests that Australian Steamship
affairs were very snug. Of course, pref.
holders did not object: their divs. were
limited to 6 p.c., and at least two points
better could be got for their money else-
where. About £247,000 of the half-million
was found by selling Government and other
debentures. This comparison of balance-
sheet figures throws further light on the
matter:—

Liquid assets were cut into Jior £370,317 and
liabilities expanded £120,305. At, December
31 the co. had £255,930 more deposits than
at the previous balance. The source of these
deposits is not ascertainable, Jmt probably
a big portion represents Australian Steam-
ship cash left in the care of the parent con-
cern. The present position of Howard
Smith’s is that liabilities , exceed its own
liquid assets (not including shares in subsi-
diaries as liquid) by almost a quarter-million.
A balance-sheet combining the steamship
subsidiary and holding co.’s accounts would
probably "throw a very different light on the
matter. Howard Smith’s is in the same
category as British Tobacco, Henry Jones
Co-op. and other holding cos.: the investor
muse take a lot on trust and not expect to
have his curiosity satisfied with respect to
details.

the prefs. got 8 p.c. (£37,144), but the ordi-
nary div. fell from 12 to 9 p.c., with only a
trifle of £998 left for reserves. Though the
accounts suggest that net earnings were
£17,524 smaller than for the previous 12
months, The Bulletin would be very sur-
prised if the co. barely earned the 9 p.c. div.
Caledonian Collieries, Ltd., is mostly
Howard-Smith, and having the backing of
that big shipping concern to assist the mar-
keting of its high-grade fuel, it probably did
quite as well as most collieries which have
been showing fat profits. The published
accounts make no attempt to reveal actual
net earnings: no Profit and Loss statement
is presented, and one entry—“balance for the
year, £130,260” —is the only announcement
of trading results. The extent of that “bal-
ance” depends wholly on the allowances made
for depreciation of machinery and plant, for
amortisation of leases and mines, and on
other provisions. An examination of
balance-sheet figures does not throw any
light on these matters: the co. is still spend-
ing large sums on developing and equipping
its long string of producers, and the stage
has not yet been reached when movements of
liquid assets in relation to liabilities amplify
the meagre information as to earnings. The
following comparison shows that between
the last two balancing dates liabilities ex-
panded £8340, and liquid assets shrank
£35,198 —a weakening of the liquid position
by £43,500-odd :

Earnings not disclosed may possibly have
been assisting development and equipment.
They are. matters which only an inquiry with
the probing powers of a Royal Commission
can fathom. On the other hand, hirer' anpro-
priations of profits may be required to
place Caledonian Collieries on as sound a
footing as some of its competitors: when the
co. was floated assets were given a value
much in excess of the figure the Howard-
Smith crowd had paid the former Scottish
owners of the leases. That fact has to be
taken into consideration when noting the
comparative mildness of average : div. rates

This softgoods-warehouse has had a bad
buffeting. Two years ago stocks bought in
nigh markets exceeded If times its total
funds, and in unloading theifi and subsequent
purchases £157,000 has been lost. That
figure includes, besides losses 'disclosed in
Profit and Loss accounts, £39,000 of taxa-
tion reserves which have disappeared.
YY Aether that reserve was required to cover
assessments on boom-time earnings has not
been disclosed, but its disappearance is in-
cluded with losses to show the full effect of
the disastrous run. From flotation in 1912
—when £50,000 was paid for goodwill and
£6187 was spent on preliminary exes, (malt-
ing a total deficit of £56,187 to begin with)
—to the 1921 balance, surplus “profits’’
amounting to £177,156 were stored up.
During the past two years £170,248 has been
mopped up by trading losses and deprecia-
tion of stocks. The co, is, therefore, now
in much the same position as it was when
it was turned over to a public co., though
there is £395,000 of paid capital instead of
£220,000 with which it started. The war-
time “prosperity” has proved to have been
froth and bubble, but fortunately the direc-
tors were not misled into issuing any bonus
scrip during the abnormal period. Some of
the losses have been due to exceptional cir-
cumstances over which warehousemen had
no control; the behavior of many overseas
manufacturers has been a bitter lesson to
Australian importers. During the war
the warehouses had difficulty in securing
stocks adequate to meet the lively demand,
and many houses over-ordered in the hope
of having their requirements met. When
the slump arrived and industrial depression
curtailed the demand in English markets,
manufacturers promptly set about execut-
ing all arrears of Australian orders. The
local market was flooded with these high-
priced goods, which have had to be written
down to prevailing values. Felstead’s
£45,620 of losses for the past year wore pro-
bably mostly due to delayed indents, at war
prices, flooding its show-rooms, though “un-
seasonable weather conditions” are also de-
clared to have restricted the turnover.
Though stocks have been written down to
current market prices, their volume is still
so large that the book value at January 31
was only £l6OO less than at the 1922 balance
and £20,624 larger than in January, 1920.
Liabilities are consequently still very heavy:

The directors report that “practically no
further losses on stocks need be anticipated,
and consequently a return to dividends may
be confidently expected.” The position would
be much healthier, though, if stocks were
down to normal. The troubles of the past
three years can be summarised in another
way. At the 1920 balance there were
£303,459 of liabilities apart from £33,000
of mortgages on properties; at January 31
last £364,100 was owing, in addition to
£20,000 of mortgages. The surplus of liquid
assets over and above liabilities (not includ-
ing mortgages) has declined from £387.080
to £303,690, though meanwhile £75,000 of
new capital has been put into the business.
After payment of the prefs.’ final div. and
allowing cover for £lOO,OOO of pref. capital,
the £295,000 of ordinaries had the backing
of tangible assets with a book value of
£245,721, or 16s. Bd. per £1 share. Thus,
one-sixth of ordinary capital is represented,
by goodwill.
Commonwealth Agricultural Service
Engineers, Ltd. (generally known as the
C.A.S.E.).—--In 1920 three Diggers became
interested in a £7500 engineering co. in
Adelaide —Technical Engineers, Ltd. —which
held Australian agency-rights for the J. I.
Case Threshing Machine Co., Wisconsin
(U.S.A.). That co. is one of the world’s
biggest manufacturers of tractors and farm-
ing machinery, and has been established
more than 80 years. Technical Engineers
had imported two tractors, and the enter-
prising Diggers set out to test the machines
under local conditions. Eight months’
demonstrations on S. Aus. farms proved that
a big saving could be effected by displacing
horse-power with kerosene-tractors. One of
the Diggers, A. V. Bridgland, set about
forming an independent co. to handle Case
machines, and finally Commonwealth Agri-
cultural Service Engineers (£100,060 nomi-
nal capital) secured the agency rights from
Technical Engineers for £l5OO cash and
7500 fully-paid £1 shares.
Though the C. A. S. E. Co. began a little
more than 18 months ago, its development
has been so speedy that an elaborate pros-
pectus-catalogue has been issued offering
200,000 further shares. But it is more cata-
logue than prospectus, many details neces-
sary to guide the investor having been
omitted. The directors, however, have pro-
vided the “Wild Cat” with all particulai-s
sought and an audited balance-sheet as at
February 21. The latter shows that the
co. was badly handicapped for want of
funds. Of the 100,000 shares 22,500 had
been fully-paid and 77.500 were paid to 10s.,
giving altogether £61,250. The purchase of
the engineering business of Technical Engi-
neers and the A. M. Rodda motor- and
general-agency business at Kadina (S.A.)
the latter gave the co. a footing in a prosper-
ous farming district—and preliminary and
demonstration costs had absorbed a lot of
capital. During the six months to Decem-
ber 31, 120 tractors had been sold, and
settlements could not be expected in most
instances until after harvest. So in Febru-
uary liabilities totted up about £69,000. To
get additional funds promptly the manage-
ment arranged with some of the wealthier
shareholders to underwrite £lOO,OOO of 8 p.c.
cum. prefs. and 100,000 £1 ordinaries to be
issued at 2s. per share premium and paid to
os. for a start. The underwriters (Associ-
ated Investors, Ltd.) are to receive 4 p.c.
(£8000), and though that is a stiff commis-
sion, the arrangement has suited the co. very
well. Under their agreement they put up
±lO,OOO cash to start with (representing the
2s. premium), paid in £50,140. more on Feb-
ruary 27, and are obliged to lodge securities
for the balance.
C. A. S. E., Ltd., has so far done very well.
To December 31 it had sold 146 tractors,
and for the current half-year the manage-
ment expects to place at least 200 more;
orders are at present being booked at the
rate of eight per week. The co. claims that a
big saving of costs has been effected wherever
tractors have been installed, and expects a
much larger turnover now that branches
have been established in all mainland States.
The hrst year’s operations showed a loss
of £6571: for the next seven months a net
profit of £11,606 was disclosed, and a div.
at the rate of 10 p.c. p.a. was distributed.
Early shareholders are now to be rewarded
for their enterprise, and for foregoing a div.
in the first year, by a 2s. per share distri-
bution (the money for this is made available
by the new-share premiums) ; but most of it
is being put back to buy new shares. This
bonus would have been much more satisfac-
tory if it had been a straight-out capitalisa-
tion. The future of the concern is wholly
dependent on the management’s ability to
market Case machinery and motor-cars —
separate cos. are being formed, in which the
parent receives an interest, to push motor
sales. Including the underwriting commis-
sion, payments for agencies, etc., shares
issued in lieu of wages, preliminary exes.,
etc., £32,000-odd of capital will be repre-
sented by goodwill items. They are assets
which should receive prompt attention from
the directors when the distribution of future
profits comes under consideration. The Case
agency agreement expires in 1931, but the
directors are already negotiating for an ex-
tension, and are confident of a renewal on
satisfactory terms.

Directors John Grice, Bowes Kelly and
Wm. Jamieson are faced with their stiffest
problem in the affairs of this co. The losses
shown in the table are after charging deben-
ture interest; but during the past eight years
very little of the interest due to bondholders
has been paid, and in addition to the deben-
ture debt of £172,000 liabilities of all sorts
have piled up: funded dividend certificates
and interest, £21,295; deferred debenture in-
terest, £45.676; interest and unpresented
coupons, £3368; deferred rent and interest,
£37,475; sundry creditors, £3837. In nine
years the drift has been as follows:

Liabilities (apart from de-
bentures) 21,448 101,420 113,652
Excess liabilities .. .. £5,876 £75,650 £86,066
Meanwhile, there has been some outlay on
renewals; for instance, the whole of the
Burnie-Guildford section of the line was re-
laid a couple of years ago with 601 b. rails
in place of the 401 b. threads which had stood
since construction in early Zeehan days. As
that silverfield shrank, so did the prospects
of this co., which had paid £lOO,OOO for
“rights,” raised a lot of funds to connect
with Zeehan and leased the Emu Bay-
Bisehoff line. The agreement under which
lessors and debenture-holders allowed their
rent and interest to accumulate expired on
December 31, and, unless the hard-heads who
comprise the Board have been able to con-
vince creditors of the hopelessness of the co.’s
affairs, they are confronted with the pro-
blem of paying all charges in full as they
fall due, besides making good all arrears in
June, 1925. On the first day of next year
all the debentures mature. The position is,
therefore, desperate; apparently the only
hope for creditors is to cultivate patience, in
the hope that the management will yet make
ends meet sufficiently to allow them to re-
cover a little of their money. But imme-
diate prospects are not bright. Apart from
rent and interest, last year receipts exceeded
working and management costs by only
£13,621, and at December 31 bank balances

is the universal question. The only possible reliet
in time will be by big installation of Pioneer W ood

this wonderful pipe make for speed in every opera-
tion. As well as getting a new, adequate and effici-
ent service, in time it would effect a saving of
approximately £lOO,OOO. Its claims should cei-
tainly be investigated. 'The Australian Wood Pipe

one of these contracts. They are issued
on a basis highly profitable to his estate,
besides providing the necessary cash to
meet the very substantial Death Duties
(State or Federal) on deceased estates,

of that may be required for renewals and re-
pairs to maintain the railways m working

100 000 £1 -paid prefs. entitled to 8 p.c. but
only half cumulative. So .far nine years

“W’gabba”: It is a marvel to me that
the goose who is of such assistance in the
development of many so-called gold-mines
still lays golden eggs. The poor bird has
been so plucked that it has scarcely a feather
left, and still it comes again. I have in
mind a spot where a slight rush was engi-
neered which soon faded out because the
yellow metal was present in microscopic
quantities only. Blank, however, never gave
up the search, and recently he came into
town hawking a couple of pieces of quartz
showing free gold and an official assay cer-
tificate showing an assay of 640 z. gold from
ore taken from his mine. Several birds fell
to it,” paying £lOO for a one-fifth share. I
was approached to take the last one-fifth. I
stipulated for a look at the show first, and
turned it down after taking a few rough mea-
surements of the ore showing and a coup e
of samples which gave nothing like the offi-
cial certificate in results. The new owners
were getting practically nothing after three
months’ effort, and a geologist was called
in to diagnose the patient. His samples
assayed less than half-an-ounce all round,
and there wasn’t too much of that in sight.
This experience is further evidence that Gov-
ernment assay certificates are capable of
doing a lot of harm at times in getting the
unwarv bird away from his cash. The U.S.
Smelting and Refining Co., the biggest thing
of its kind in the world, kept some statistics
which too-eager gamblers in unproved shows
might well paste on their bedposts. Over
a number of years this co., on the advice °f
its highly-trained mine-valuers, turned down
290 out of every 291 shows offered to it.

Brown’s Reward, Yalgoo (W.A.), has an-

Ualla Rookh, recently floated in Perth, has
treated to date 12,000 tons for 13,0000 z. Ihe
reef 160 ft. down is Oft. wide, and although
opened up for only 20ft. it looks like con-
tinuing. Values at 160 ft. average an ounce,
but very little stoping has been done between
the 60ft. and 160 ft. levels. The reef and
country rock <irc hard, and a rock-drill outiit
is being installed. The property was taken
over from ait enterprising party of Daggers.
The mine appears to have a chance, but it
has been worked for years, and has not given
much in divs.

Dorrie Doolette’s success at Sandstone
(W.A.) has emboldened speculators to pros-
pect other “deserted and discredited” parts
of the Murchison field and re-open abandoned
shows. Until Doolette and his friends came
along, operations at Sandstone were confined
to quartz reefs, but it has since been found
that on the Bulloak, which the Mararoa Co.
has optioned, the ironstone used for mill and
boiler foundations carries good values. Ihe
neighboring Yalgoo field is also receiving
attention; one old mine there about to be
tried again is the Emerald,, which yielded
some sensational returns in 1905 and then
faded out altogether.

penditure items were: Working costs,
£74,024; taxes, £9670; London administra-

lowing assets: Cash £94, J4o, sundry
debtors £216,253, stores etc. £14998.
There was a debenture debt of £1,0 1 0,640.
The co. also owed £44,531 to suiidi y
creditors. The management redeemed £40,719
of 41 p.c. debentures from land-sale receipts
during the year, and £9902 worth since the
accounts closed. It has also retarded £<oB3

is in accordance with the Articles, which
provided that the eontribs. should get the
first cut in a winding-up, notwithstanding
that those w r ho got paid-ups in the first in-
stance had to pay up 10s. per share cash to
set the show on its feet. The distribution
is hard on buyers of those shares, and is
another warning to scrip-dabblers to become
fully acquainted with the rights attaching to
the paper they buy.
The Emmaville (N.S.W.) rumor that
Great Britain intended to work its leases on
its own account again, now that the tin
market has improved, was ill-founded.
Secretary R. N. Kirk writes: “This co.
has, and had, no intention of terminating
the tribute arrangement.”

“Zeb” : The fire which occurred at the B. H.
South Blocks mine (Zinc Corp.) on March
23 was apparently caused by the spontaneous
combustion of some greasy waste at the bot-
tom brace of the mainshaft. Fortunately it
was noticed in time, and the mine fire-fighting
force had it quickly under control. Had it
got - out of control before the fan could be
stopped the results might have been bad tor
the men underground. This shaft is the
principal liauling-way connecting all working
levels, and the only one by which all the
men could be quickly removed from
the mine. There are no connections
with the South mine, the immediate
neighbor. This is a serious matter;
but the Act says the Minister for Mines
may direct that neighboring mines be con-
nected. There are connections between
some of the Broken Hill mines, but at the
south end the Central, South and South
Blocks have none at all. Of these the South
is the best equipped to get its men out in case
of fire; there are three hauling shafts, two
of them touching the bottom level and the
other only 200 ft. above. _ These three shafts
are all downcast, and, in the event ot fire
underground, provide a clear get-away for
the men in fresh air.

For 60 years or so Tumut has periodically
threatened' to unearth a big goldmine for
N. S. Wales, but promises have never materi-
alised. The last was Goobragandra, four or
five years ago. The owners refused to con-
sider any proposition from speculators; now
it is for sale at any price. The latest threat
comes from Mount Piper, 14 miles from the
township. The Billapaloola syndicate is re-
ported to have a lode proved for 900 ft. Drives
are being put in at 50ft. in 2ft. of stone, esti-
mated to be worth 4oz. A tunnel has been
driven 100 ft. on another lode, which is said
to be 4ft. wide and worth up to 2oz. It is
to be hoped that the battery which is about
to be erected will confirm these values.
Cock’s Pioneer, Eldorado (Vic.), pro-
poses to get power to call up 2s. 6d. per
share by increasing the 100,000 20s. paids
to 22s 6d. The half-crown may not be
called up, but will always be within hailing
distance if operations on, the new section of
the lease require funds. A barge has been
built, and No. 4 by wash has been con-
structed at a cost of £4500. Meanwhile
profits are coming from the section of the
lead now being treated. Borings in the
block to be attacked suggest nine to ten
years’ work. E. H. Shackell declares that
the ground will have fewer okl workings and
less stiff clay and, generally, will be much
more easily ' handled than the section now
being worked out.

Retaliation Reward’s year’s option over
the Great Southern, Bendigo, was secured
for £250 cash. If the option is exercised
£7750 is to be paid from gold winnings and
25,000 paid-ups are to be ladled out. Plant
and battery is being leased for £l2 10s. a
week during the option. Billy Cundy, YV.
J. Rickard and others testify to the past
greatness of the mine. It stands in a zone
embracing old-time giants such as Fortuua
Hustlers, New Chum Railway and Blue Con-
solidated. Cundy outlines a scheme of work
in shallow and deep ground, and is specially
keen on opening up at 1111 ft. level on the
last back north and south. He recommends
dipping into the reef beyond the fallen
ground at 14, 15 and 10 levels and cross-
cutting for the east back of the 1500 ft. reef
from 17 and 18 levels. Rickard is even
more emphatic about the old show ; he holds
that systematic prospecting would revive its
fortunes, especially if the big reef between
14 and 16 levels is again opened up. Retali-
ation Reward has more than a long-shot
chance at the Great Southern, but its backers
must be prepared to put up ample funds.

“Jackar”: A conference of Vic. mining-
men has decided: —
Despite the defects in the existing system of arbi-
tration, caused primal ily by the overlapping of
State and Federal authority, the Chamber of Mines
would be well advised to support legitimate attempts
at judicious amendment rather than any movement
with the object of totally abolishing the control of
industrial affairs by legislation.
Disputes between mineowners and employees
were almost unknown before the interfer-
ence of industrial legislation. It vvas the
proud boast of Bendigo that during GO years
there had not been a day’s work lost in the
mines through strike or lockout. Ballarat,
with its extensive quartz and alluvial -fields,
had almost as satisfactory a record —any dif-
ferences that there had been were so paltry
as not to be worth recalling. But the most
remarkable instance of the maintenance of
goodwill and amity is that of the Muonta and
Wailaroo mines. Fot three-quarters of a
century these combined community settle-
ments, which probably never had a popula-
tion of actual mine-toilers of less than a
thousand, only once knew industrial strife.
The time-honored Cornish systems of “sist,
tribute and wages, all on sliding scales
according to the value of copper, prevailed
to complete mutual satisfaction. Disaffec-
tion and turmoil followed the introduction
of legislation, which practically told employ-
ers and employees that they were not capable
of conducting their own business. Even
then, outsiders were chiefly to blame for any
industrial trouble. The co., having gained
partial exemption from the application of
awards, has reverted to the sliding-scale sys-
tem ; minimum wage rates have been fixed,
and Gd. per day more is to be paid while
standard copper averages £7O per ton, and
Gd. additional for each rise of £5. This sys-
tem is not possible in connection with all
mines, but wherever practicable it ought to
be adopted as a simple element of common-
sense.
* * * *
New Nell Gwynue (Bendigo) has lost no
time in getting to work. The winding plant
and battery at the old Balaclava Hill mine,
Whroo, and the massive set of poppet-heads
at the Catherine mine, Eaglehawk, have been
purchased, and are now being removed. Ihe
co. expects to make a showing inside three
months. # #
“ J.C.”: Comments by “Ajax” (B. 8/3/’23)
concerning the extensive alluvial system be-
tween Mt. Mitchell and liomebush (Vic.), a
distance of 14 miles, are at variance with
known facts. The Mines Department, in a
geological plan published some years iigo,
showed two leads, one from Ballarat West
and the other from Beaufort, the Caralulup
lead being on the downward trend after the
confluence of these two streams. Boring has
proved the fallacy of this theory. There is
abundant evidence showing that the whole
svstem starts from the dividing range, north
*;nd nor’-west of Ercildoun. This adds to
the attractiveness of the proposition; it is
a well-known fact that near the sources ot
all alluvial fields the gold contents are heavier
and in greater quantities, and difficulties, such
as drifts and water, are less than down the
streams. The lead, where partially explored,
is richer in sold contents, and has. less diiii
and water than any known alluvial system
in Vic., not excepting the famous Madam
Berry. The probabilities are that hundreds
of thousands of ounces of gold are to be won
at comparatively little cost. Why some enter-
prising mining-crowd has not exploited this
area is incomprehensible. Two lines of bores
would settle the whole question.
* * *
Great Southern Oil has abandoned search
on its leases of 4500 acres in South Gipps-
land. The syndicate took samples ot seep-
ages from a mound alleged to be perspiring
oil but Vic. Mines Department tests didn t
yield a trace. What appears to be the same
hillock is now the inducement of a new
float, which Gippsland cockies are invited
to support. If the two mounds are the same
it is up to the Mines Department to say a
word or two.
Lander Oil will not be the only co. boring in
the Roma district in the near future. A
Brisbane co. has taken up other areas north
of Roma, and will probably have Doe. .Jensen,
who has done most of the geological work
in that district, to guide it.
* * # *
Tewantin oil-bore, which is going down
on the coast north of Brisbane under
the supervision of C. E. Nicholas, has struck
a heavv flow of artesian water at J-t *tt.
Signs of oil were reported a couple, of weeks
back at almost the same spot, and then came
an 80,000-gallon per day flow shooting well
above the bore-head. The directors say. they
can seal it off easily, but there may be
further troubles in the sandstones beneath.
The heavy flow also indicates a syncline ot
the worst structure for payable oil supplies.
Borers elsewhere fight shy ol water-logged
syncline*. # „
Efforts to locate oil in the tertiaries at the
Narrows and Baffle Creek, near Gladstone
(Q.), appear to have fizzled out. Monduran
Creek is in the same boat. L. C. Ball re-
ported on the areas years back, but was not
over-optimistic as to prospects. Ihe pre-
vailing idea is that the deposits are too shal-
low to carry much. #
Queensland’s February gold yield totalled
72480*. (fine), of which Mt. Morgan sup-
plied 4834cz. Mt. Coolon was second with
!>440z., to which the Coolon mine contributed
more than half, with the Sydney a good
runner-up. When these two shows and the
Native Bear and the Horseshoe »et wel
into their stride, the field on the full year,
run should easily rank next to
Scottish supplied Gympie s February quota
with 3500 tons for 7250 z. .
Minnie Moxham, Chillagoe (Q-). basbeen
slow in showing returns since the treatment
plant was put up. It has now been decided
to work the two reefs separate Jo
bigger winding plant has been installed to
haul the expected larger tonnage. Jo tar the
mine has beeii unwatered to the 200 ft. level,
and good values have been located o n both
reefs between 130 ft. and 200 ft ore
carries antimony, which gave a lot of trouble
when treatment was on a* small scale.
Mt. Peter gold show, Cairns district (Q.),
which made a decent strike in the shaft a
few weeks back, has not stood the test n
driving at the 85ft. level In loft, of driv-
ing to the north-east the shoot ran from 3ft
of good mineral-stone down to about Jin. or
lightlv mineralised stuff. However there
still appears to be a chance of a good shoot
pitching underfoot to the south-west of the
shaft. A trial crushing from around the
shaft has been taken out. but results have
not yet been disclosed,
* * * *
TJlam marble, near Rockhampton (Q-),
appears to have become coarse and solt at
depth, and is now making a poor showing
against the imported white Italian. Trans-
port of nearlv 20 miles to rail is a furthei
handicap. The Aberdeen quarry is being
opened up nine miles from Archer siding,
and better things are predicted for it. How-
ever, the deposit, though of good color, is
not uniformly fine-grained, and it is not
certain yet how it will open up.
Some interesting and instructive figures
are available respecting the Rand mines,
which have earned splendid profits since the
reorganisation of the industry after the
strike, and this despite the heavy decline in
the gold premium. Consequent on the strike,
the first quarter of 1922 resulted in a. loss
of about £1,250,000. During the remainder
of the year, following on reduced wages and
general costs, divs. amounting to £5,068,418
were paid. In 1920 divs. totalled £8,275,000,
and in 1921 £7,164,000, and in each case
the figures were less than had been received
in gold-premium. Last year's premium
amounted to £2,450,000, or only about 43
p.c. of the amount paid in divs. In the last
half of 1922 costs averaged 20s. 4d. per ton
of ore milled, as compared with 255. Bd. m
1921. the saving of ss. 4d. per ton having
more than compensated for the 4s. 2d. shrink-
age in the gold premium. Of 38 producing
cos 17 do not figure on the div.-list, and 85
p.c. of the total distributions were made by
10 mines. The average return for 1922 on
the whole of the capital invested on the Rand
was about 13 # „

“Saint”: It was Henare’s first experience
in a train, and the success.on of won-
ders had reduced him to a state of round-
eyed astonishment. When we plunged into
the tunnel there came from his corner sun-
dry grunts indicating dismay and suspicion
—he evidently didn’t like it. Then the train
rushed into daylight again, and a voice was
lifted in profound thankfulness and wonder.
“Py korry, it’s to-morrow!”

“Allbutt”: My neighbor Sykes was beat-
ing his dog when I arrived home the other
day. As I knew the animal to be a cherished
possession I asked the reason. The owner
explained that part of Towser’s duty was
to bring home the groceries, the money being
placed in the basket with the order. This
day the animal had not returned to time,
so Sykes went out to investigate. He found
Tiger making disgraceful love to a lady
friend ; but although the basket lay on the
footpath the money was gone. “I’ll teach
him to spend money fooling about with
women,” Sykes grunted, as he made another
hit at the shivering pup.

“How do you know when the honeymoon is over?”

“Steele Post”: I disagree from “Digger’s
Batman” (B. 22/3/’23) when he contends
that the German forward divisions could
be “placed” by means of the conduct and
peculiarities of their troops in the front line.
Certainly the Saxons were always for the
quiet life when left unmolested by their two
enemies—the German Higher Command and
ourselves; but an assumption that an in-
creased peppering of our forward lines by
artillery coincided with the entrance of the
Wurtemburgers. would have been dangerous.
As a matter of fact, it was a rare thing that
a German line division had its own artillery
covering it—much rarer even than with us.
The operations of the artillery would be gov-
erned by someone “higher up” than the com-
mander of the Wurtemburgers. One thing,
however, I can vouch for: the Germans did
know sometimes when we were opposite
them. Just after Hamel we captured a
German divisional order, a paragraph of
which translated somewhat as follows:
“Opposite us are the Australians, these tall,
strong men from the bush, who creep stealth-
ily on us through the long grass, by day as
well as by night, and woe betide any of our
forward posts or patrols that are caught
napping. Beware!”

of the annual controversy between the
Church and the Show, “severely reproved”
those who advertise our drought conditions.
If only Bruce had been in Sydney on the

“F.A.’s” thumbnail sketch :
The old gentleman gave vent to a couple of
“Tuts” in response to my abject apologies for hav-
ing temporarily balanced my 14-stone on one of
his feet. At Macquarie-street two Diggers got in,
each with a leg missing. A little further on a
sightless warrior was helped into the compartment
by a cobber who was short of a wing. The old
man looked from one to another of us for a while
and then said with a touch of feeling: “Gad, boys,
we’re a nice. lot! Why, there isn’t the makings
of a couple of sound men amongst the lot of us.’’
“Why, Dad, what are you shy of?” asked one cheery
cripple. “I wish I was shy of this new-fangled
contraption I’ve got strapped on to my old stump,’’
was the reply; “I was a heap more comfortable
before my niece made me wear it.” He told us
he was 81. A bullet had knocked his left knee-cap
off during a skirmish on the North-West Indian
frontier in ’7B. They had decided to take the log
off and did it while he looked on. Some of/ns
began to think this last wasn’t such a bad old
war, after all.

“Cleveland”: In the big shipping cos.
operating on the India and China coasts, the
funeral of an officer or engineer rarely
without some of his cobbers drifting along
to see him well and truly
planted. At times, how-
ever, he was personally un-
known to anyone in port;
yet it was necessary, in
order to uphold the prestige
of the white, to detail some-
one to act as chief mourner.
To give due solemnity to
the proceedings our co. pro-
cured a conventional plug
hat, which the official weeper
returned to head office imme-
diately after the obsequies.
Generally speaking, the duty
was undertaken willingly
enough; but occasionally,
when an unpopular skipper
or engineer passed out,
juniors who had smarted
under him rebelled at the
suggestion that they should
appear woe-stricken even for
the sake of appearances. One
such was Bloggs, an iras-
cible blighter, better known
as Banchute, the Hindu-
stanee equivalent of the Aus-
tralian blankard. After the
first shock had sunk in, the
natural question arose as to
who should do the “honors,”
There was a hilarious crowd
in port, but the head serangs
were amazed and de-
lighted at the readiness with
which the juniors signified
their willihgness to take an
afternoon off and attend the
funera 1. A scandalised
marine superintendent took
a tumble when he met the
remnants of the party at 11
p.m. One of them was wear-
ing the official stove-pipe
with two white bands
painted round it. This
was the color-scheme on the funnels of the
oo.’s steamers, and to this day lie does not
know whether the painting was done before
the funeral or after. I do, but it would still
be as much as my life is worth to say.

“Wilfrido” on a Maori election

mixing gratuitous -strawberries with the usual soft
soap at Eden : but the treating charged against the
knighted Pomare includes everything from the hors-
d'ceuvre to the savories. The charges against him
are that he gave away sums of money amounting to
£39 to procure his return; turned on free beer at
the Star Hotel at Tauranga; promised to obtain
employment for certain persons if they would vote
for him; being the Native Minister, threatened to
exclude others from the benefits of the West Coast

to take me to the pictures.”
Settlement Reserve Acts if they wouldn’t; promised
others that he would relieve them from county
rates, and permitted double voting and interference
with voters by the returning-officer’s associates. The
petition seems to be regarded by Hori as a good
method of striking a blow 7 at Pomare for not sub-
scribing to the faith-healing tenets of Ratana, the
Maori prophet. The system of polling for the Native
members is not the same as that which is followed
in the case of European representatives. There is no
Maori roll, for the simple reason that Hori is far
too lackadaisical to have himself placed on it if
there were one. On election day he puts on his Sunday
best, and on arriving at the booth is asked his full
name, his iivi (tribe), his hapu (sub-tribe), and his
kainga (place of abode). The voter is then asked
whom he chooses, and this is written down for him
on a paper that is signed and initialled by the
returning-officer and his Maori associate. These
two persons .are the only ones present besides the
voter, scrutineers not being admitted until the poll
is closed. Thus it will be seen that the proceedings
can readily become very free and easy. In the case of
this Western Maori electorate, the petitioner, one
lianapu Ilaerehuka, is a member of the Arawa tribe,
while Sir Maui comes from the Ngatitoa; and the
two tribes have been on mutually cannibalistic terms
since the Greenstone Age. Kanapu, a disciple of
Ratana’s and a nephew of Ratana’s secretary, is
leaving no stone unturned to push out Pomare. An
appeal has been circulated throughout the electorate
calling on all Ratana’s friends to collect and supply
evidence that can in any way assist the charges.
Extensive funds have been collected, and daily prayer
is being offered that fire should be sent down to
consume Pomare and his supporters. In certain
districts the residents say they can’t sleep because
the natives are rehearsing every night the testimony
that they are to give at the sitting of the Court.

“Theolog” : “Horton,” discussing war-time
mascots (B. S/3/’23), calls to mind the abo.
Pte. “Jacky” Roberts, well known to all
10th Batt. men. Jacky’s delight was throw-
ing a specially prized boomerang over the
Fritz front' line, which cheerful pastime twice
cost him hits from snipers. He went west
trying to retrieve his mascot when it once
fell short.
* » * *
“Speculum”: The Navy brings a nautical
atmosphere ashore with it. . All land estab-
lishments are named and administered as
ships, and every man in the service is “borne
on the books of” a sea-going or depot ship.
The depots are often called “stone frigates,”
and their buildings, offices, etc., are, as far
as possible, named after the parts of a ship.
There is, of course, a quarter-deck, usually
a small asphalted parade ground, and it is
saluted in the same manner as in a ship.
“Stellsby” (B. 22/;-i/’23) refuses to accept
the religious origin of the naval salute, on
the ground that Henry VIII., who had no
time for Holy Church, “begat” the British
Navy. Still, the senior Service likes to trace
its real origin from Alfred the Great, who
built the lirst fleet to combat Britain’s
enemies at sea. This leaves plenty of time
for the adoption of a few church customs.
How, indeed, account for the White Ensign
and the “recover” position in saluting with
the sword if church influence is denied?
* * * *
“Me Tax”: Australia’s old-time surveyors
(B. 8./3/’23) weren’t all marvels of
painstaking accuracy. One part of the
Tabulam estate,
on the Clarence
River (N.S.W.),
was originally
subdivided into
20-acre blocks, 20
by 10 chains. On
the re-subdivision
recently I found
differences of from
one to two links
per chain, making a
difference of from
slightly less than
one-half to more
than three-quan-
ters of an acre per
block. On this
particular section
there were over a
hundred blocks, so
the accumulated 1
error is rather
high. Possibly
some of the old-
timers were like
one I knew, long
since retired and
now living in the
Cold Country. He
and his little grey
pony were a fami-
liar pair. His sole
instrument was
the prismatic com-
pass. Seated in
the saddle he’d set
a bearing, and the
chain and chain-
man (the pony)
would do the rest.
Strange to say, he
was a fiend for
permanent mark-
ing. I have found
his pegs, chiefly
red cedar, on the Clarence in good order,
and still carrying the chiselled number,
surrounded by a heap of stones, and with
lockspits like a young stone fence.
From the Federal Gallery :
President Givens, of the Senate, expresses the hope
that pressmen won’t be given the freedom of Parlia-
ment House at Canberra. He has had enough of their
alleged “privileges” at the Spring-street residence,
and it was due to his suggestion, if not to his direct
initiative, that they were banished from the library
and denied the use of the tennis-court and bowling-
green. From time to time, of course, a galleryman
tends to abuse the liberty allowed him in the House,
GOING AND COMING.
FLO: “I believe Alma's wedding simply beg-
gared description.”
JOE: "It did —to say nothing of her father.”
but, as a general thing, the behavior of Federal
roundsmen.r-is. faultless. Givens’s grievance is prob-
ably personal; he is the sort of ignorant and arrogant,
person who couldnit be popular, and the fuss made
of certain craftsmen bv members must be galling to
a man of his stamp.

THE TRIUMPH OF AUTUMN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Here lies the passionate summer, conquered, bound,
Her scarf of crimson torn and her red limbs
Burned with the north that raised his fiery hymns
Of roaring adulation when the ground
Cracked with disaster, ere the thunder drowned
The strain in wilder music. Morning dims
filer flaunting cloak to pearl; and silence skims
Like a brown swallow through the haunts of sound.
In green and purple triumph Autumn comes
Veiling with luminous grey her quiet face ;
But by the chill wheels of her silver car
Runs panting Summer for a little space,
Spleenful in doom, but listening for the drums
Of the Goth Winter beating from afar.

“Winkle”: Of course there’s faith healing.
Take a case. “Scotty,” one of the first
“stumpies” to return from Anzac, was in
my ward in Caulfield Military Hospital. He
was then up to his 17th op., with more to
follow. So great had been his sufferings
that all mild drugs had lost their efficacy for
sleep-inducing, and for a long time morphia
was injected nightly. After his long period
of agony came a time of ease; but Scotty
found that he could not sleep without his
dope, and kept the whole ward awake for
many .nights. Then his nurse had a brain-
wave. Every evening she would give the
patient his dose per hypodermic, and within
10 minutes he would be sleeping like a tired
child. But there was no more morphia in
it than there was dynamite.
GETTING DOWN TO ESSENTIALS.
“My wife was a Melbourne girl. Wot’s yours?
“A. long beer.”
“Tin Hat”: It would be hard to imagine
more hideous agony of anticipation than that
which must have preceded the recent death
of a Vic. railway man. Working at his job
of point-cleaning, he had signalled a goods
train a hundred yards away to come on,
when the points shut and securely gripped
his foot in the interlocking mechanism. Out
of sight of the signalman who had thrown
the points, and unable to attract the atten-
tion of the engine-driver, who had turned
away to attend to some mechanical defect,
the unfortunate man could do nothing to
escape the death that rumbled slowly towards
him. At the last moment the driver noticed
him crouched on hands and knees almost
under the engine, but it was impossible to
pull up the heavy train in time.

“Jaydick”: A young Albury parson, try-
ing hard to look solemn, read out to an
amused congregation the following announce-
ment :
On Wednesday, 21st March, a United Day of Prayer
and Humiliation for Rain will be held. At 8 o'clock
an Inter-Denominational Intercession Service will be
held in the Presbyterian Church. Should it rain
in the meantime, thanksgiving services will be held
in all the churches on Sunday morning.
Apparently Wednesday evening would be
too precious to spend in merely thanking the
Lord. That could wait till the regular
church-service day came round.

“Hambone” under his anaesthetic: —
I support “Dr. Nil” when he says ether makes
you talk (B. 15/3/’23), and I believe that events
immediately prior to inhalation largely determine
what you talk about. A bit of Fritz ironmongery chipped
into my leg in T 7, and sent me to a Canadian C.O.S.
near Poperinghc. Immediately I had accepted the
doc.’s adjuration to keep cool and calm, and drawn
three deep breaths, things began to happen. 1 was
engaged in a desperate bout with one Les Darcy
and, having annihilated him, I commenced
to slay the Kaiser with my own hands.
Then I was reciting Lawson and Kendall.,
until a Canadian nurse informed me, in response
to a feverish inquiry if I was going back to God’s
own country, that I was. Before I returned to
sanity, a couple of hours later, I saw Sydney Heads
as plainly as a spiritualist sees ghosts. Now for the
influences. Immediately before the call to action
the dug-out occupants had disturbed my efforts at
constructing a set of verses by a heated argument as
to the rights and wrongs of Les Darcy’s ill-fated flit
to America, which switched off into a discussion as
to what would be the fit punishment for Bill Hohen-
zollern if the Allies caught him. The last thing
T. remembered after the piece of 5.9 hit me was the
assurance of our battery officer that I was a cert,
for Blighty, and perhaps for Aussie,

“The Oldest Inhabitant”: Apropos Aus-
tralia’s first cavalry regiment and Colonel
MacDonald (B. 15/3/’23). “F.A.” errs in
claiming the honor for the N.S.W. Lancers.
The first Australian cavalry regiment was
established in Melbourne about the time of
the Crimean War ; it was “yeomanry cav-
airy,” each man provid-
ing his own horse and
accoutrements. A split
occurred, and a section
of the troop formed the
Prince of Wales Light
Horse (Hussars). Mat-
thew Hervey, M.L.C.,
who occupied a squat-
tage with 90 miles’ front-
age to the Murray, yet
died a pauper, was cap-
tain. All the leading
merchants and squatters
joined the corps. The
new troop required a
drill instructor, and
thereby hangs a tragic
tale. The- 40th Regi-
ment of Foot, occupying
the old iron barracks in
Spencer-street, had a
man of huge build as
sergeant-major. His
name was McLean.
Leaving the regiment, he
took, first, the Red Lion
Inn in Lonsdale-street
West, and then the Bull
and Mouth in Bourke-
sfeet. He and his wife, a
little wisp of a woman, con-
stantly quarrelled, and
finally lie got two years
for stabbing her. He
was an excellent drill-in-
structor and swordsman.
(I have seen him in
tournaments competing
with Professor Parker,
whose feat of cleaving a
sheep’s carcase with one
sword-cut always at-
tracted attention.) Mc-
Lean had drilled the yeo-
manry and taught the
troop how to handle the
sword. Now the Prince
of Wales Light Horse
wanted him as drill-
instructor, but he hap-
pened to be serving his
sentence in Melbourne
Gaol. Influence was
brought to bear on the Governor, who
agreed to release McLean if the troop
would be responsible for his good behavior.
The guarantee was given, and the portly
McLean commenced his duties, and was
steadfast until the corps was disbanded.
Then, in the early ’sixties, he and his wife
went to Maoriland, quarrelled there, murder
was committed, and the ex-sergeant-major
was hanged. ■ ' .
“Pedro”: The recent outburst of oppro-
brious publicity about spats is all right
enough, but why are the satirists silent about
the glove-carrying habit, which is a worse
one? In the cocked-hat-and-skin-tight : pants
days gloves were necessary in order that the
owner (or ower) thereof might have some-
MATERIALISTIC.
“My husband has no sentiment."
“How dreadful!”
“Yes, I can cry for hours without getting a penny out of him."
thing wherewith to slap a pal in the face by
way of. challenging him to a duel next morn-
ing. To-day they don’t serve that or any
other purpose, and make the most pathetic
concession to fashion that is to be seen on
the highways. If the gent, wore a spare
necktie or an extra sock, there would at least
be the excuse that he might need a change in
more or less necessary apparel. But he isn’t
going to need those gloves—just hawks them
around because other imbeciles do it. If we
are going to laugh bootcuifs out of fashion,
surely we should also howl down the all
kinds of idiot who doesn’t think himself fully
dressed unless he has a set of gloves grasped
in his left fin.
* * * *
“Andy”: The disturbance that shook
our up-country pub to its foundations the
other day arose from one of the
gentlemen boarders referring to
the cook as a cow. She threat-
ened to leave and go back to
town; she was a lady, she was,
and wasn’t going to be called
names like that by anyone.
This was no good to Bung, so
he called up the boarders and
put it to them that unless who-
ever was responsible apologised
to the cook there would be no-
thing to eat for a week or so.
No one admitted the crime, and
Bung’s frame of mind was not
sweetened when some whiskered
reprobate, a bit hard of hear-
ing, asked what the inquisition
was about. “I said I want to
know who called the cook a
cow,” bellowed the angry pub-
lican. “Oh,” retorted Beaver.
“Well, I want to know who
called the cow a cook.” That
joint is now short of both a cook
and a boarder.
“H. Singemoinc” on a matter of food: —
A Bulletin writer’s remarks (8/3/'23) about a
la carte as against table d’hote meals recalls the
sensible old Continental convention whereby a diner
may order one portion for two. We have it here
to a very limited extent. I go to the Australia,
for example, with my wife, and pay 3s. 6d. for
one portion of hors d’oeuvres (it would take a
particularly lusty pair of Germans to consume 75.-
worth of hors d’ceuvres)'; 4s. for one portion of
whiting sause au vin blanc ; and 12s.- for a chicken
Maryland. I thus get an a la carte dinner com-
posed of dishes which I like, and which I know the
chef does well, at a table d’hote figure. In most
places I am offered my choice between a table d’hote
meal containing perhaps not a single viand that
appeals to my wife or myself and an a la, carte one
in the course of which twice as much is served up
(and paid for) as we can eat. I agree with The
Bulletin’s stout and despairing contributor, that
the d la carte system is coming presently in all
our big hotels. The wise course for. diners to pursue,
however, is not to set up a. series of barren wails
on the subject, but to convince hotel and restaurant
managers that fair play is profitable play—in other
words, that no one will-go on indefinitely paying
for'masses of food that he can’t eat.
“Harry Stottle” : The Manchester Radium
Institute recently dropped its entire stock-in-
trade on the floor.
It consisted alto-
gether of a frac-
tion of a grain of
radium worth
about £l5OO. The
authorities had
the floor taken up,
and made it into
a carefully-sealed
bundle, which
went by the first
boat to America.
There it was cre-
mated, and some-
thing like half the
departed radium
was recovered.
Prof. Curie, of
Paris, whose wife
fi r s t discovered
radium, once had
a similar experi-
ence, and at Liver-
pool Infirmary a
tube of radium
disappeared one
day. The staff
remembered that
the ward was
being swept at
the time of the
loss, and they
started in pursuit
of the dust-cart
like one man. The
contents of the
smelly vehicle were
tested with an
electroscope, which
detects the pres-
ence of radium,
and the missing
phial was found.
The anxiety about
these trifles is
excusable when it
is remembered that
the world’s supply
of extracted
radium is hardly more than six ounces, val-
ued at about £3,500,000.
* * * *
“Weiry”: Australia House is certainly
earning its money by securing “desirable
immigrants to fill the waste spaces of our
mighty continent,” as our spruiking Pre-
miers put it after a few wines. The Wol-
verton Express (5/l/’23) tells how one shy
immigrant bird was captured :
Supt. Callaway informed the Newport Pagnell
Bench on Wednesday that the rn,an had not paid a
fine of 15s. for stealing lead piping. A distress
warrant had been issued but he had no effects. Now
the man and his family were emigrating to Aus-
tralia. The Bench took a lenient view of the matter
and cancelled the fine.
BOTH WOUND UP TO STOP.
HORACE : “Beastly nuisance, but I suppose
I must be ducking — what's the time?
My watch isn’t going."
MISS BORED : “You know you're so slow in
setting it a good example."
TO-MORROW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Some folk seem to live in a wearisome mess
Of perpetual bustle and haste;
They don’t think they’re properly busy unless
They haven’t a second to waste.
I give all such persons whenever I can
The best of advice (all I’ve got):
“You should probably do it to-morrow, old man,
And probably not.”
They tell you their consciences give them no peace
If some trivial job be not done,
And they try to explain how one’s calm may increase
When pleasure and duty are one.
But they in themselves give such theories the lie
(Though, without them, we know they are rot).
“They should probably do it to-morrow,” say I,
“And probably not.”
Perhaps, for example, they’ve letters to write;
At once is the time they select.
And if they be forced to postpone them till night,
You would fancy their futures were wrecked.
But I stay and rest by the fire while I can,
And murmur, when pleasantly hot,
“I shall probably do mine to-morrow, old man,
And probably not.”
If they in their eagerness try for a 'bus
And ifiiss it, they start in pursuit,
And, puffing and blowing—the deuce of a fuss —
Will follow for furlongs on foot.
But / stroll along in a better-bred way;
Fat people I' hate to see trot.
“I shall probably catch one to-morrow,” I say,
“And probably not.”

M. B. Ive, who was the host, of the eclipse
observers at Cor-

Centralia last Sep-
tember, has been
ill ever since, and
has just died in
Adelaide. He w T as
a far-northern pas-
toralist all' his life,
managing thou-
sands of square
miles mainly for
the Beltana Pas-
toral Co.; he suc-
ceeded Peter Waite
as managing direc-
tor only a year
ago. He never
married.
Speaker DAN
LEVY, of N.S.W.,
who has been
quarrelling 'with
the Sydney papers
over his alleged
discourtesy to
Parliamentary
reporters.
Between 1901 and 1921 the female popu-
lation of the N.T. increased by 345. but
males diminished by 1281. Now that Harold
Nelson, chief work-stopper of the A.W.TJ. in
the Territory, seems to be definitely chosen
as talking (but not voting) member for the
district, he will doubtless come south, and
give the papers a chance to interview him.
He managed by his strike tactics to close
the Territory’s meat and shipping industries,
and nearly close its mining industry. The
two burning questions are: (1) When he
becomes Prime Minister does he propose to
pursue the same policy all over the Com-
monwealth? (2) What does he propose as
a substitute for work ?
Hibble, chairman of the Commonwealth
Coal Tribunal which has been sitting in
N. S. Wales to hear the application of the
owners for a severe cut. in miners' wages,
was knocked out by the job, and doubts
whether he can carry on. Not many men
could. To a great extent the Coal Tribunal
-one of Hughes’s brill,ant ideas —is a fraud
on the public; and Hibble himself, when he
hears the miners’ and owners’ representa-
tives quarrelling fiercely around him, must
suspect that they do it with their tongues
in their cheeks. Of course they didn’t agree
after the recent “hearing,” so it was left for
the unfortunate Hibble to make a decision
which was quite satisfactory to both sides,
leaving wages where they w T ere and giving
the owners the excuse to leave coal prices
where they were. Hibble, a barrister by
training, has lived on the coalfield for many
years, and. before getting the job of chair-
man of this so-called tribunal, was coroner,
among other things.
The new Irrigation Commission in S.A.,
which is to manage all the Murray settle-
ments, has been entrusted to two local ex-
perts and a Vic. engineer. E. J. Field, the
chairman, has handled big things for the
Land Department of S.A. —immigration,
drought relief, and soldier settlements.
Samuel Mclntosh is an authority on irriga-
tion, has managed schemes all up and down
the Murray, and has attended conferences
im Italy and the U.S.A. Richard Ilorsfield,
tile engineer, got practical knowledge in the
Thompson foundry at Castlemaiue (Vic.),
lias been town engineer at Beachworth
(Vic.) and Albury (N.S.W.), and now drops
the job of executive engineer of the Rivers
and Water Supply Commission in Melbourne.
“Pedro”: S’Walter Buchanan passed, along
£lO,OOO to Victoria College, Wellington
(M.L.), for the study of agriculture and
rural economics. In my youth I knew him
well—a small, bony, sandy, spluttering
Scotchman, who in the train journey from
Wellington to Carterton was always cutting
pieces out of the Yankee agricultural papers
for future reference. He had a “station,” or
whatever it might be called, away out near
Tupurupuru, and when he occasionally got
into the House of Reps, was renowned as
one of the worst speakers and one of the best-
informed men on the premises.
Passed out in England at 82, E. H. Mac-
kay, whose name figures largely in Queens-
land’s pastoral history. He came from Ire-
land in the early ’sixties, and among his hold-
ings were Huntley, Bellkate, Kynuna, Alpha
and Lanark. He married Jessie Knox,
daughter of the knight who counted among
her brothers W. E. Knox (of the C.S.R.)
and Adrian, the Federal C.J. Macka.v was
a director of Dalgety and Co. and the Liver-
pool, London and Globe Insurance Co., and
Sydney knew him well till he went to Eng-
land in 1911.
Gone from the Vineyard, John Norton,
R.C. Bishop of Port Augusta (S.A.). A
placid individual, he bished over lone wastes
unheard of till the Transcontinental put
them on the map. He was 68 when a para-
lytic seizure intervened.
A tardy movement to preserve the memory
of late Premier A. H. Peake is now going
strong in Adelaide, with Lance Stirling as
chairman and Hudd as secretary. An oil
painting in Parliament House is a certainty,
and the Government has promised a Peake
scholarship, giving a boy or girl a free course
at the ’Varsity in any subject desired.
The N.S.W. branch of the Returned Sol-
diers’ Assoc, has strafed precedent by elect-
ing, for the first time, a rank-andffile ex-
Digger as President. L. C. Elliott, who gets
the job, is an old “Grammar” boy, who was
admitted to practise as a solicitor in 1914
and enlisted the following year. He served
with the guns until the end. As hon. solici-
tor for the League he has already given it
good service.
“Jimmy” Nangle, who bosses Technical
education in N. S. Wales, started life at half-
a-crown or thereabouts a week. But, though
times were hard for a while, he presently
got himself apprenticed to a firm of builders,
and while he was still only in his teens was
put in charge of a job in Bridge-street.
Nangle spent all his spare time studying,
and established himself finally as an archi-
tect. He sent himself to the University, also,
and went through the engineering course.
The N.S.W. Government then secured him to
take charge, first, of the Technical College
and then of its whole system of technical
training. Mindful of his own struggles, he
takes a personal interest in the boys who
want, their start in life, and lie has a gift
for discovering what a boy’s real bent is.
. “Caveman”: W. T. McCoy, Director of
Education in South Aus., has gone to visit
Europe’s best educational mills. He has
held his job for three years, after making
hjs mark on a similar billet in Tassy. Many
N.S.W. teachers (and children) will recall
his burly appearance. Everything about him
was (and still is) on the large size—figure,
voice, work and ideas. One of his hobbies
is to encourage young teachers to “talk shop.”
His idea is that if a few young teachers meet
about once a month, and, failing a club room,
sit on a fence-rail and yarn, the youngsters
will get some benefit out of it somehow. Now
he goes to yarn on European fence-rails with
other educational experts.
The mother of the bushranging Kellys,
Mrs. Ellen King—she married twice —passed
°ut at Greta West (Vic.) on March 27 at
95. She landed in Australia from Antrim,
Ireland, in 1841. and married Kelly at Bal-
larat 10 years later, afterwards settling at
Greta. She left three married daughters,
and her surviving son. Jim, is a well-known
identity of the Wangaratta district. Since
the tragedy of 40-odd years ago the old lady
had lived a secluded life in the ranges at
Greta West. Her passing is regretted by
the many who knew her as a kind-hearted,
brave woman, who bore a woeful burden with
much fortitude.
Fired his last salute at Wellington (M.L.».
Captain Thomas Joseph Davis, 71. The son
of a soldier who served in the Maori Wars,
the captain had been connected with the
military since he was 11. When war broke
out he took on gratuitously the job of com-
manding the sth Wellington Regiment, and
many of Maoriland’s best Diggers passed
through his hands.

The right kind of woman can dredge
romance out of a pig-trough. One of the
witnesses in the Myerson case in Sydney
admitted that she had been in trouble over
dealing in goods subsequently proved to be
stolen. She was then a widow, but had since
married the constable who arrested her,
Rockhampton (Q.) has lost a good sports-
man in A. M. Headrick, who was respon-
sible for the institution of the Rockhampton
Cup, and had a C. Q. Derby and two “Albion
Thousands” to his own credit. He flashed
past the post carrying a weight of 56 years,
and finished gamely after an unavailing
operation in Sydney last year.
The death of W. Burgess, an old Cessnock
(N.S.W.) resident—he arrived as an infant
and lived thereabouts for 7!) years—recalls
a unique family alliance. Burgess and his
two brothers married three Crossley girls,
and two Burgess sisters took Crossley
brothers for better or for worse. It’s a
strong clan these days.
“F..J.”: On April 3, 75 years ago, Dr.
Ludwig Leichhardt wrote his last known
letter and sent it from McPherson’s station,
on the Cogoon, to a friend in Sydney, which
city the eccentric explorer had left early
in 1848 on his last journey. John Oxley’s
first expedition left Sydney on April 6, 106
years ago. Flinders and Baudin exchanged
greetings in Encounter Bay, April 8, 1802.
“You’re not such a barefaced crew as I
imagined,” said a Parliamentary supporter
to Alec Peacock the other day. When the Vic.
Education Minister looked for an explanation
of the obscure compliment, he found that his
Liberal friend was speaking literally. Five
of the Cabinet (Lawson, Robinson, Baird,
Angus and Clarke) are clean-shaven; six
(McPherson, Barnes, Oman, Peacock, Pen-
nington and Merritt) wear fringes under
their noses, and one (Davis) has a tvell-
barbered ziff.
Victoria Drummond, the first sea-going
woman engineer, came back to Sydney on
the Anchises with the declaration that she
likes the work and intends to stick to it.
Australian literature owes something to
N.S.W. ex-Premier Dooley, plain as he may
be, inasmuch 'as he invented the term “un-
couth crooks” which so well described the
parties to whom it was applied. The best-
known composition of his rival McGirr has
been a bill for rent.
Another civil servant gets out. Chester
Lord, the new Tas. representative of the
Hume Pipe Co. (Aus.), Ltd., moves into
that berth from the more irksome and less
remunerative routine of the office of Sec.
to the State Law Department.
Recently demolished, after almost falling
to pieces, the Woodville Hotel (Q.), on the
St. Lawrence-road, 40 miles from Rock-
hampton. This was the pub kept by the
well-connected bushranger Frank Gardiner,
after he had fled from the down-south police.
Woodville in those days was a busy place, b’eing
on the main road
to Clermont and
other towns in the
Peak Downs dis-
trict. Numerous
teams passed
through loaded
with copper ore,
and the Canoona
gold rush was in
full swing. This
latter proved to be
the undoing o f
Gardiner, for some
of the diggers re-
cognised him and
notified the police.
J. J. Roberts,
auctioneer, just
dead at Goulburn
(N.S.W.) at 74,
claimed as his
maternal grand-
father that Win.
Hutchison w h o
was Commissary-
General to the 12tli
Regiment, Collec-
tor of Customs and
probably Austra-
lia’s first banker.
Wm. Hutchison
acquired land in
many parts of the
new territory, in-
cluding 2600 acres
at Botany ; but he
wasn’t a barnacle.
John Lackey, long
President of the
Leg. Council, was
“.T.J.’s” stepfather,
and a brother was
the late Jam e s
Roberts, Sydney’s
fi rs t superinten-
dent of trams. Be-
sides calling him-
self Mayor for a
term, alderman for
25, and secretary
f o r half-a-dozen
Goulhurn public
bodies, he had held
half-a-hundred auc-
tioneer’s licenses consecutively.
Charles Champion, who was buried the
other day at Faulconbridge (N.S.W.), was
the last to go of the two men who shared
the reward offered for the discovery of the
body of Lee Weller, one of the victims of the
notorious Butler. It was the fuss made by
his friends about Lee Weller’s disappearance
that put an end to Butler’s career as a “gold
prospector.”
Archbishop Lees caught doing in a liver
at the ponies could not scandalise the Mel-
bourne suburb of P’ran more than the dis-
covery that Eugene Conway had been found
guilty of marital cruelty involving substan-
tial alimony and a judicial separation. Con-
way, quiet and seemingly inoffensive, is
one of two survivors of a large clan which
has had more than its share of affliction. Ilis
father, who left a fortune running well into
six figures, started in P’ran hawking boots.
Then he opened one shop after another,
steadily amassing cash and acquiring free-
holds until he became the largest property-
holder in the suburb. He had a numerous
tribe of boys and two girls, but tragedy
gripped them, till but two boys were left —
the only two, by the way, who married.
_ Fred Davison, now vice-president of the
N.S.W. Returned Soldiers’ League, was in
San Francisco when the war started, and
tried to raise a Legion of Australians for
service. The idea caught on, but the lI.S.
Government interfered, whereupon a number
of the legionaries crossed to Canada and
enlisted there. Davison, who was con-
nected with newspaper work, fought hard
to awaken America’s active sympathy for
the Allies, but, finally deciding that the
job was hopeless, came to Australia and
enlisted, though well over military age. His
son joined up in Britain. On his return
to Australia he ran a monthly paper mainly
devoted to the criticism of Government
interference in industry: but it. didn’t get
enough support from P.E. to live. He is
dow an estate agent and- alderman at Vau-
cl use.
THAT HAT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The hat worn by Governor Davidson at the
Sydney Show suggested a compound of the double-
decker of an Indian planter and the sombrero of a
Mexican cowboy” —Sydney paper.
He seemed a cut-to-patteru nob
To most of us before;
Attired in current mode he’d lob
About his mostly social job,
Precise the garb he wore.
He prosed and droned in quite the best
Approved vice-regal style.
The rebel soul within his breast 7
Was scarce suspected till expressed
In this stupendous tile.
He chose the topics safe, whereon
A figurehead may spruik ;
The platitudes at which he shone,
The ultra-decorous duds he’d don,
Were quite beyond rebuke.
But even knights who serve the king
And follow fashion pat
Once in a while may have a fling;
And off his tail ’twas his to spring
With that tumultuous hat.
He tired of Grundyism’s grind,
I shouldn’t wonder—-what!—
Of togs by master-snips designed
And aides invariably inclined
To murmur “Better Not”
When innovations are discussed.
For years convention-rid,
Escape for once he felt he must
And —started his sartorial bust
On this Wild Western lid!
To ease him from the stress and strain
Of ceremonious rig,
He might, attired in checks, ’tis plain,
Have sung- a song in the Domain
And danced an Irish jig.
Yet there are narks who’d make a song
About such pranks as that,
Whereas, as ’tis, there’s nothing wrong,
Though whiskered coves from Billabong
Mix with the city’s Show-time throng
And gaze intent, entranced and long,
Upon bis Ex.’s hat.

“Snell”: Dix, the bush missionary, visited
the Miners’ United at Peewee and found Carver,
the braceman, refreshing himself from a bottle of
whisky, Carver having had a night on the evening
before. Dix was a prohibitionist, and he rated Carver
soundly for taking of the liquor that bewilders
when on duty, with men below whose lives depended
on his sobriety. The good man presently took over
Carver’s bottle, and sprinkled its contents down
the shaft. There was silence for a moment; then
a voice from the depths cried, “Hello, on top!
What’s it raining? Heave up, man on.”

“D.F.”: Who was the forgotten genius
that invented the modern way of working bullocks ?
The really old-time bullock drays had shafts instead
of a pole, and the bullocks were handled much as
horses are now. You will find an official record of
the old style in “Historical Records of Australia,”
vol. 15 of series 1. There was a formal inquiry
by a Board at Newcastle into an allegation that one
John Rodd had wrongfully used a dray and its team
of three Government bullocks on his private occa-
sions. What would a modern bullocky say if he
were asked to drive a team of three? Yet in 1829
it was nothing out of the way. There is a local
legend that the pole for bullocks was invented neat
Dapto in the Illawarra country (N.S.W.). Perhaps
it was.
‘‘The Rumpus”: In the Cannington
(W.A.) district recently I brought down a large
eagle-hawk, which, besides the usual brilliant gold
and brown markings on the outside of his wings
and back, was sky-blue on his body and under his
wings. Can any Abo. say if this is nature's camou-
flage for the chicken-snatcher while soaring in the
blue?
* » * *
“Kim”: A death-adder killed the other
day at Kimba (S.A.) was found to contain 26
young ones, all between five and six inches long.
Five men witnessed the dissection, and are prepared
to take Bible oaths that it wasn’t the beer.
*■**■*
“Sarah Anue”: An old chap batching near
our Queensland selection was tormented at night
by dingoes. He laid baits, and next morning
reported “One dog last night.” The following
evening he came over and said he had collected a
crow and an iguana; they had eaten some of the
dingo. Next morning he came again: “Got a
native cat; he ate some of the crow.” Doubting
the old chap I investigated, and sure enough there
were the dingo, the crow, the iguana and the cat.
I insisted on his burning the lot —goodness only
knows what he might have got next. My husband,
perhaps.
“Long ’Un”: If any Abonias is interested
in fossils and other ancient relics, give him the
office that there are several happy hunting-grounds
open to him along the Murray, in the shape of
the coffer-dams for the locks. At No. 3 lock, jiist
below Cobdogla (S.A.), there’s a solid layer of
fossils of shells quite unknown to the present Mur-
ray. Also, several of the navvies have found
what they call “shark’s teeth.” Some scientific
Abos. will no doubt recognise in these the Denlus
incognitas, or some other Dago.
“Jimmy Possum”: A while back someone
asked why the adults of the Australian fever bark,
Alstonia constricta, all slant to the west in one
particular district. The reason probably is that
during the period of most vigorous annual growth
the wind is from the east. While some trees
are not much affected in the early stages of
growth by the direction of the wind, others are.
At my home the jacaranda trees all lean to the
nor’-west. This inclination, I noticed, was the
result of the wind here blowing from the south-
east during January, February and March —the
three months in which they grow most. I tried
hard to keep the trees straight by tying them
against the wind, but they would go nor’-west.
* « * *
“Barcoo”: Fishing in the Proserpine
River (N.Q.) a man landed the catch of the season
—a groper weighing 3081 b. He had it cut up and
distributed among his friends, but it wasn’t par-
ticularly tasty. From the gourmand’s point of view-
groper isn’t to be compared with the barramundi
which frequent the tidal waters from Maryborough
round to the Gulf, or the golden perch, which in-
habits the inland rivers. Each is a toothsome fish,
with a delicate flavor, and no small bones to worry
the diner. In fact, there is nothing superior in the
Southern Hemisphere to the barramundi.
“Adel”: Can any member of the Abo.
Council tell me the name of a bird about the size
of the scaly-breasted tit ( Acanthiza squamata) r t The
back is light brown, from tip of the tail to the
beak, and the under part is smoky-grey, with black
streaks across the breast. The head is thin and
elongated; likewise the beak. Thin strips of paper-
bark compose the nest, which is lined inside with
short but wider strips of the same material; it is
dome-shaped, about 3in. wide and sin. long, and is
invariably attached to the end of a tea-tree twig
from 3ft. to Bft. above water. About 40 nests were
found hanging above a little stream, about 800yds.
long, in the middle of January, and contained two
or three eggs. Those with three eggs had one with
reddish spots; the others were white with browm
spots over the large end. I met the little fellows
near a spring in a secluded gorge in the Gulf coun-
try (N.Q.).
* * * *
“Yarrum”: There is a vast difference of
opinion about the number of eggs laid by the phea-
sant. On the Cordeaux River, behind Mt, Kembla
(N.S.W.), I had an old hen’s nest under observa-
tion for seven years, and I never saw more than
a single egg—a dark one—in it at a time. A
male and female chick came from these eggs in
alternate years; but I can’t, say if that is a
regular occurrence. Last week a naturalist wanted
to assure me that the bird laid two, or three—
never less than two —eggs; but I’m prepared to bet
my bluchers on one.
“Ragar”: Let me in on the carpet-snake
v. kiddy argument. I was watching my three young-
sters —the eldest seven years old —hauling at some-
thing attached to the stump of an old tree in the
paddock, and wondering what they were laughing
at, and why they were swaying and staggering about.
They had got hold of the after end of a carpet-
snake, and were trying to drag the thing out of the
hole in the stump. The four feet of reptile with
which they were amusing themselves was lively
enough to send them reeling this way and that. I
’clouted the kids and killed the snake, which
measured just over 9ft. long.
*,* * *
“Pantagruel”: During a heavy thunder-
storm. at Coorumburra (Q.) a flash of lightning
struck the ground near a lagoon and spent its current
in the water. Immediately almost all the fish in
the lagoon were killed, and hundreds of them floated
on the surface. Exactly the same thing happened
in a neighboring lagoon a few years ago.
“Allerud”: This is what happened. The
selector had three nasty horses in a dray and was
sitting on the shaft, one leg inside and one out,
when the near side leader ran back and kicked him.
The leg was broken above the ankle. He got out
of the back of the dray, hopped up, and put a Lock-chain
on the wheel. Then he started for home to get crutches
(two hair-brooms, about nine inches too short).
After that he made for the nearest neighbors, eight
SINS OF OMISSION AND COMMISSION.
REVEREDN ONE: "I don't know what's wrong with the bally
machine."
REVEREND OTHER : "Ah, brother, you have left undone those things
you ought to have done , and have done those things you
ought not to have done."
miles away, reckoning to go through in one night.
But owing to his sound leg giving, on account of ‘in
old hurt, he was three days and ten hours on the
journey, with no food, but plenty of water in a
creek. The shatter perished, but the leaders got
clear. “Durella’’ told the Abo. Council something
about it (B. l/3/ ! 23), but had these two items
wrong: the selector is 57 (not 65) and was never
unconscious. Yes, I am doing well, thank you, in
Quilpie (Q.) Hospital.
* * * »
“Bogan Bill”: In answer to “George It.”
(B. 15/3/’23), there was a big blue kangaroo-dog
that went bush years ago in the Nyngan (N.S.W.)
district, and took to killing sheep, partly for food
and partly for sport. It was nearly eight months
before a bait settled him, and in that time he
accounted for over 500 sheep. That, I think, is the
record.
“FY7”: “Dunedarra’s” grasshopper, im-
paled on a wire barb (B. 8/3/’23), might, as he
says, have been a victim of accident or suicide.
Again, he might have been filed there for future
reference by one of our shrikes, a family well repre-
sented in Australia by the butcher-birds. All these
fowls have a custom of hanging up the tucker they
don’t wish to eat immediately on sharp thorns and
similar conveniences.
“Jimmy Possum”: I am inclined to think
it was the fresh meat that sent ii A. Jocelyn's’’ gruntevs
to the porcine paradise (B. 22/2/’23). A heavy
meal of fresh meat may cause piggie to turn up his
toes within a few hours, unless he has been, brought
up ori a meat diet. I treated the lord of my pigsty
to a skinned opossum one evening, and the next
morning I had to call in the undertaker. Yet,
strange to say, a sick pig can often be cured by
giving it a moderate feed of fresh meat—say, a hunk
of bullock’s liver,
* * * *
“50”: If that Rookwood sexton (B.
8/3/’23) is really bent on getting rid of the ants
which impiously prevent the good lady from staying
by her husband’s grave, let him spread, fresh stable
manure, as free from straw as possible, over the
antbed and all round the edges, making a heap
about six inches deep. At the end of a week, if the
manure has been left on and shaken up once or twice,
all the ants —aged, middle-aged and young—will have
joined the other residents of the cemetery. Moreover,
no other ants will ever consider that particular spot
as a desirable site for a residence with ev. conv.
* * * *
“Hayseed”: “Dr. Nil” (B. l/3/’23) says
that it was probably a Yankee agricultural machinist
who prevailed on S.A. cockies to fallow and use
super. Fallowing and working fallow was practised
in S. Aus. long before the time he speaks of and
long before super, was thought of. My dad grew
20 bushels to the acre on well-worked fallow 50
years ago. Super, only came into general use after
successful experiments at Roseworthy College by
Professor Lowrie.
“Pat Bushie”: Bill had been courting
Sarah for a month. Then one night, after a pro-
longed silence, he proposed, and she blushingly
accepted. Silence again reigned for a time, to be
broken eventually by Sarah, who asked: “Ain’t yer
goin’ t’ say any more, Bill ?” “Why,” asked Bill,
“ain’t I said enough fer one night?”
* * * *
“Centurion”: The most serious result of
the reported destruc-
tion of animals by
hoodlums in the Auck-
land (M.L.) Zoo would
be the loss of two
Tuatara “lizards,” or
sphenodons. These
lizard-like beasts are
the sole remaining
representatives of the
Rhynchocephalia, and
are practically the
same type to-day as
the original founders
of the family, who
flourished in the age
of the giant reptiles.
Once fairly common m
Maoriland proper, they
were wiped out by the
invading hog. Now
they ale found rarely
even in isolated islands
oh the mainland. The
Tuatara is peculiar for
its three rows of teetn,
one down the middle
of the palate. This
row grows directly out
of the skull and jaw-
bones, and is not re-
newable when worn-out.
On top of the head
likewise are vestiges
of a third eye, less
atrophied in this speci-
men than in any other
of the vertebrates,
whose rudimentary
third optic is usually
referred to as the
pineal gland. Small,
sluggish and a ground
dweller, the Tuatara
looks like taking an
early departure to join
his fathers, dead these
millions of years.
“Mulga”: Tell “Sana” (B. l/3/’23) that
if he comes to the Blackall (Q.) district he will find
floats put in plenty of tanks, so that the birds can
get a drink. But all the floats in the world won’t
prevent birds from being drowned in the tanks.
I’ve often seen them drowned, and we always kepp
floats in our tanks.
TIE MISSED HIS CHANCE.
POET: “I think I shall find much inspiration
along this stream.”
LOCAL: “Ah, you’ve struck a quiet time. Yer
should ’a’ been here last winter when
the new road was making. There used
ter be always sir fights of a Saturday
evening up at the pub.”
“Stevenry”: I agree with “Cab” (B.
8/3/’23) as to kookaburras eating small birds. I
caught my tame kooka. dining on a blue wren the
other day, and a neighbor found two dead jacks in
a cottage which had been locked up for six months.
The only possible entry was by the chimney, and in
the chimney was a starlings’ nest. The coroner’s
verdict was death by misadventure while in search
of food.

GAME TO THE LAST.
MR. FOOZLE : “I’m fed up with you laughing
at my game. If I get any more impu-
dence, I’ll hit you, over the head.”
CADDIE: “ Righto! I’ll bet yer don’t know
which is the right club to do it with.”
NAT DOOLAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In other days, a careless lad,
Nat Doolan used to ride
His chestnut mare on summer nights
Along Waitangi side;
And up the steep and stony track
He’d whistle as he went,
And on the Look-out draw the rein
And pause, as u content.
Beneath him, blending with the sky,
Sapphire with amethyst,
He saw the ever-changing sea,
And the spray and rainbow mist
Where Ocean breaks against the cliffs
In coils of creamy foani,
And the curving beach and the Valley Flat,
And the bush behind his home.
Nat Doolan went, a careless lad,
To fight across the sea.
And said good-bye to bush and beach,
And gglden kowhai-tree.
Nat Doolan fought, Nat Doolan fell,
And dreams the years away
Out on the desolate fields of France
Far from the quiet bay.
Yet sometimes on a summer night,
When on Waitangi side
The weka calls, and shadow falls,
They see Nat Doolan ride;
And sharply-cut against the sky,
Upon the Look-out Hill,
They watch him pause, as if content,
And hear him whistle still.

“Bill Bowyang”: Here’s a cow-spaying
performance that. puts “Birre Gurra’s” record (B.
8/2/’23) in the shade. At Blenheim station, on the
Bowen River (N.Q.), a youngster named Bates re-
cently spayed 32i cows in 9hr, lOmin. At the
same station he .also spayed 1800 cows with under

performance was J. Bailey, and there were five other
witnesses.


Willard
Cleveland, Ohio, 11. S. A,
It’s as unsatisfactory to judge a
battery by its looks as to judge a
man by his clothes. Other bat-
teries may look like the genuine
Willard Threaded Rubber Battery.
They may even have certain Wil-
lard features. But you can’t get all
the Willard advantages unless you
know the battery to be a genuine
Willard made in the factory that
makes the batteries used on 200
makes of cars and trucks. Be sure
the name “Willard” is on the bat-
tery you buy.

“Ento” : “Lenah” (B. l/3/’23) says there
are no such things as native bees. On the
authority of Hacker (Queensland Museum) there
are 871 species of native bees in Australia, and a few
more have been described since Hacker’s list was
published. Doubtless many more are to be discovered
yet. Perhaps “Lenah” would classify these as “wild”
bees, but they are gentle and mild compared with
the “domestic” kind.

“N.Iv.C.”: A while back Abos. were dis-
cussing the bombardier beetle. Since then I have
been wantonly attacked and fired at not by a beetle
but by large sugar ants which had a flat in a stump
I was operating on. The ants put their tail between
their legs and fired forwards, each ant getting off
about four shots of whitish spray. I think it was
formic acid, for I got some in the eye and had to
knock off work to bathe it.
GOOD OLD BOB.
“And are your thoughts true to Bob now he’s in Fiji, dear?”
“Rather! Why, even when any other fellow kisses me I try to think it’s Bob.”
“Comet”: When fox-hunting last winter in
the hills along the Upper Murray I picked up a
stone axe, evidently used by the blacks in days
gone by. The head is of granite, V-shaped, chipped
to a sharp edge and attached to a wooden handle by
thongs smeared with some kind of gum. What
trick of the trade did the blacks know to be able
to attach an axehead that has stood the elements
for at least a century ?
***••*
“Dune”: At Rydal (N.S.W.) show, on
February 18, 1922, a district orchardist (A. J.
Brown, of Meadow Flat) took first prize for Jonathan
apples. This year the show was held on March 10,
and Brown weighed in with the same apples as a
non-competitive exhibit. Between shows the fruit
had merely been wrapped in paper and placed on a
shelf. Yet it was in perfect condition.
“Tarago”: The snake-and-kiddie contro-
versy reminds me of my first snake. As a nipper
of five years or so I was seated on the ground
building miniature cowsheds with bracken-fern and
a pocket-knife, when I had occasion to feel beside
me for the knife, and my hand came in contact with
something scaly and cold. Looking down I found
l was caressing what I now know to have been a
black snake, lying in a semi-circle about me. I
knew instinctively that his room was better than
his company, and withdrew my hand, together with
my person. The wriggler took no notice of my move-
ments, but when he saw me returning with an
adult, a few minutes later, he made a break—too
late.
* * * *
“Macgee”: Why this insane bush prejudice
against the catfish as an article of food? I have
sampled Whiskers, cooked in various ways, cold
and hot, and except for the fact that he’s darned
hard to peel, he will do me for packing any time.
Yet I ha\e seen country folks tackle doubtful mutton
in preference to this delicacy.
“Parama” : There’s a kind of rat haunting
the creek banks and mudflats in the Western
Division of New Guinea that I’d like to know some-
thing more about. The only one I’ve managed to
bag with, the pea-rifle measured, from tip to tip,
17i|in., of which 7in. was tail. The hair was stiff
and dark-brown on the back, fading to a dirty
white on the underparts. The feet were slightly
webbed, and armed with long, sharp and prehensile
claws. As much at home in the water as on dry
ground, it climbs among the arching roots of the
mangroves with as much ease as it ranges the semi-
liquid mud of the flats; and apparently it can remain
under water for a considerable time, as I have often
seen one dive, without being able to spot it coming
up again. It hides during the day, but comes slink-
ing out of holes in the mudbanks towards dusk, and
on moonlit nights dines methodically on stranded
prawns and hermit-crabs. The natives don’t eat it,
for some reason or other, and they’ll eat anything,
as a rule. What is it?
“X2X”: In Northern Queensland the
natives have a much better knowledge of the medicinal
usefulness of certain plants than is generally supposed,
and employ a variety of vegetable drugs. It is a com-
mon mistake to regard the clinical values of some
of these plants as merely based on superstitious
beliefs. For instance, the remedy for gonorrhoea
amongst the Gulf natives is an infusion, taken inter-
nally, made from the leaves of a small shrub
somewhat resembling Croton tiglium in appearance.
There have been white men who ridiculed its efficacy
until a chemical investigation of the leaves showed
that they contained a glucosidal body in some ways
actually superior for the treatment of this disease,
to 01. capaibae, ol'. santal. flav. or any of the other
old stand-bys. There is another aboriginal remedy
applied to ulcerating wounds, and which almost cer-
tainly owes its efficacy to the fact that it destroys
the pus-forming staphylocci and streptococci in the
damaged tissues. It is highly probable that, with
the extinction of the aboriginals, many simple and
useful remedies will be lost, and will take a lot of
re-discovering.
* * * •
“Solomon Isles”: A fierce fight had been
raging between the Methodist missionaries, who claim
the Central Solomons as their hunting-
ground, and Corphy, the local trader.
In bitterness of defeat, Corphy enlisted
the aid of the Marist Brothers. Not
long after their arrival Itai, chief of
Banietta and friend of Corphy, gave the
writer his opinion of the Methodist
missionary. “He all right a little
bit,’’ said the simple-minded savage,
“but he killem every devil. That
too much no good. Now this fellow
priest he all right. He killem some
fellow devil; some fellow he leave
him he stop. He good fellow. By-
and-bye I go along mission belong
him.” After a stubborn fight the
Marists retired from the field —the
Methodies had out-riced them. At
latest Corphy was communicating
with the Seventh Day' Adventists.
“Masi”: Many think that when a person
is taken by a crocodile he is invariably torn
to pieces and devoured immediately; but this
is not so. While crossing the Mambare River
(Papua) on a raft, in 1920, one of my native
carriers was grabbed by a croc. The following day,
on a long stretch of sand some distance from the
scene of the tragedy, we saw a huge saurian asleep
near the water’s edge with a dark object by its
side. I shot the croc., and when we got to the
spot we found the dark object to be the body of
the unfortunate carrier. He had evidently been drowned,
though there were terrible marks on the body from
the grip of the crocodile. Apparently', these grue-
some monsters let their prey lie on the sand for
a day or two before making a meal of it.
“L’Fou”: Having spoiled the varnish of
ray safe by putting its legs in water, I was annoyed
to find that, after a baffled interval, still the ants
came. The safe stood a good inch from the wall
and the ants were of that small black kind ; it would
take five or six to span a threepenny bit. Then I
found a hair acting as bridge between wall and
safe, and the ants swarming over. I brushed it
away. A few days later it was replaced. Again I
acted as destroyer. Now it's back again. The first
hair was a bit of rope fibre; the other two looked
like cow hairs. For the intellectual satisfaction of
sensational journalists, there were positively no
bloodstains on the hairs.
“202”: At Yalleroi (Q) there is a brown
Leghorn chicken which we are entering for the Pre-
cocity Stakes. It was hatched out on Jan. 22, and
on the morning of Feb. 26 started crowing in answer
to the old bird. Daily it repeats the execrable per-
formance—execrable because its voice is like a
cartwheel badly in need of lubrication.
“Winkle”: “Billy T.” (B. 15/3/”23) jokes
about the blowfly, but to me it is a serious matter.
T work at a possie next a casement window that
opens on a park, and cosy it is until the sun comes
round the comer and drives all the blowflies from
the shrubbery into the room, where they buzz per-
sistently against the fixed pane instead of taking
two flaps to the right and going out as they came
in. To save my reason I bought a swatter, and every
half-hour turn the place into an abattoir; but among
the thousands slaughtered I haven’t seen one that
was not at the depositing stage. Are there any
males, or are all blowflies bi-sexual, or what?
* * * *
“Railoba”: Are there any limits to the
growth of a stingai'ee? I saw one the other day
which taped 10ft. from tip to tip. Another, pulled
ashore in a dragnet on an Adelaide beach, measured
13ft. by Bft., and was 2ft. thick in the middle. He
meekly submitted to the death-sentence per axe,
although he could have broken through the net by
sheer weight.
* * * •
“Birre Gurra” : Do all snakes dote on the
music of a crosscut saw in action? My cobber
and I have frequently noticed them quite close
while we were working; and the other day when
engaged on a big log 1 looked across and saw the
head of a green snake hovering near my mate's
ear. The wriggler had evidently been attracted
by the sound, and had crawled on to his back to
secure a good view of the proceedings. Since then,
on four different occasions, we have had two green,
one brown and a black gentleman calmly crawl along
the log which we’ve been sawing and pause quite
close to the saw, their heads raised and swaying
gently from side to side. Can any saw-scientist
of the Council confirm our experience?
* * * *
“Molokihi” says a word for his friends: —
Since living among murderers for a considerable
time I’ve decided that, after all, they’re merely
human beings with a past a trifle more sensational
than that of the ordinary suburbanite. You see,
I claim to be some authority on the subject, for
I was associated with such people for many months
in Port Moresby (Papua) gaol. In fact, the “boy”
who waited on me at table and the other woolly-
headed individual who was cook-boy had both
escaped the extreme penalty by a narrow margin;
and even the ancient who interested himself in
my horses could throw some personal reflections on
several dark pages of Papuan history. I don't
know whether southern gaolers will agree with me,
but after living among criminals of all kinds I’ve
come to the conclusion that the murderers stand
apart, being by far the best behaved, most reliable
and least dishonest of all the classes met with. The
truth is that when a man is killed in a Papuan
village there has been usually some strong necessity
for his demise—-'ften a woman in the case —and the
man who volunteers and carries out the killing is
necessarily both brave and reliable, or he would not
run the risk of being killed in his turn by the
relations of deceased. Of course, in this eulogy
of the murderer I don’t include the sexual criminal.
He is a creature of another kind, and is despised
by every intelligent Papuan with a clean murder
to his credit.
MODESTY.
BILLO: “’As Skeeter tole you ’is father’s
got six munee?”
JOHNNO ( contemptuously): “’As ’e! Why,
’c’s skitin’ about it to everybody. And
’ere’s me with a nunkle just ’ung, not
savin’ a word about it to no one.”
REVISITED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The laughing, singing silver creek
Is laughing, silver, still;
The gold is on the mountain peak
Behind the granite hill.
The far-off purple winding range,
Clear-cut against the sky,
Has heeded not the feet of change,
Relentless, marching by.
The mountain places are the same
As when 1 went away,
Green timbered summits bright with flame
At dawn and death of day.
But gone are all the ardent dreams—
The exquisite sweet pain,
The things I visioned by their streams,
And never will again.
The things, pure-souled, remote, supreme,
Have gone like frightened birels;
I am as those who dream a dream,
And, waking, lose the words.
Sweet sister, you are sleeping where
We laid you, sleeping still;
We kissed you, and we left you there.
Alone upon the hill.
With mossy mountain-stones beside
To keep their watch by you—
A few rough things to mark and guide
Was all that we could do.
A mother sobbing by a grave
Across the years I see ;
A father, tearless, strong and brave
Who prayed on bended knee.
And ah ! the old home that I knew
Ha 3 vanished, roof and wall;
The garden where the roses grew
Is scrub-grown, rank and tall.
And where the white-crowned apple-trees
Were once beside the door
Is tangled vine; the seeking bees
Come back again no more.
The bellbirds chiming on the range
Bring trooping back to me
Dead haunting summers, with their strange
And silver melody.
Good-bye! Though I may not return
To my own hills of blue,
So long as fires of memory burn
I’ll come in dreams to you.
And, dreaming, I may half forget
The world’s black clouds of night
That keep God’s face in shadows set
Forever out of sight.

When feminine Sydney awoke on Saturday
./,nd felt the sharp nip of winter in the wind,
it shivered with joy that the cold-season’s
turn-out could be worn with comfort. So
Randwick’s frocking at the opening of the
Autumn Meeting was a veritable paean of
praise for the well-cut tailor-made and cosy
little hat of some gay color—-Oxtenest orange,
or one of its relations. Dame Margaret did
not patronise the prevailing style. She was
handsome in silver-grey Canton crepe, fea-
turing wide cape-like sleeves bordered from
the shoulders with a generous width of black
musquash. Her graceful black velvet hat
sported ostrich plumes. Lady Bridges
(S.A.) favored neat but sombre black. Lady
Stanley’s top wrap of fawn-brocaded duve-
tyn, with its wide borderings of coney seal,
was a possession that made every feminine
onlooker a robber in spirit. The Cullen
dame was in grey, and her fair daughter
Ailsa adhered to blue. Commodore Addi-
son’s wife was an early-Autumn symphony
in warm fawn tones that went with her
tawny coloring, while Mrs. Beaudesert Col-
lins was a. mammoth forget-me-not, without
any green. Mrs. Charley Oakes helped the
quiet toning of the vice-regal box in a black
turn-out. The Davidson trirleens added bright
flashes of color in their kingfisher blue frocks.
But they spent most of their time with dad
round about the horses.
There was nothing sartorially startling on
the course. A few —very few —with knee-
length skirts went on suggesting that the
prodigal was not the only one to get a fatted
calf. Randwick sadly missed its most ner-
sistent dress sensationalist. She is en route
for Europe, possibly to startle Ascot and
Epsom. She steamed off by the Narkunda
under a canopy of flowers, no doubt the gift
of admirers of her heroic fortitude under the
battery of astounded stares that her costum-
ing always occasioned.
Mrs. Prime Minister Bruce was one of
the most faultlessly attired on the lawns.
She was in black marocain, draped in
Egyptian style, but not too much so. Of
course, hubby was sartorially perfects
Monday’s race-crowd —the women part of
it, anyhow—was mostly silken-clad. Dame
Margaret leading the vanguard in silver-grey
Canton ei’epe and a pink feather cape that
gave her a gay galah air under her wide black
hat, with its* sweep of silver coque. Lady-
Bridges, after her debut in dead black on
Saturday, quite startled the lawns with her
jazz silk gown of magenta, china blue
and buff all mixed up together. Mrs. Stan-
ley Bruce was exquisitely turned out in
storm-cloud grev georgette from toetip to her
smart velvet hat. Mrs. M. F. Dalton smiled
under a wide black velour hat when her hus-
band’s horse came home, and the Sheldon
knight and his three girls offered congratula-
tions. Mrs. Otway Falkiner took their win
just as easily.
Mrs. Willie Adams —she was Hypatia
Monk, the motorist —was, as usual, the kind-
est thing on the lawns. She had brought her
company of invalid soldiers from Gray-
tlnvaitel She has never failed in this cour-
tesy since the first lot of broken men were
returned to us.
The most remarkable feature of Monday’s
dressing was the flock of small parrots that
alighted on the women’s hat-brims. Parra-
keets, lories and rosellas were freely used,
and one gay girleen sported a pair of love
birds over her left eye. Colorful certainly ;
but it jarred to view our gay bush birds so
used.
Quite a batch of celebrities looked in for
the opening of the Show. Lord Forster,
Sir Walter and Dame Margaret, the bairns
and Miss Henderson were bright and early
on the official stand; the Tingira boys gave
them a display of hornpipes and gymnastics
to go on with, and the three girl riders stuck
to their giant mounts and cleared hurdles so
that it looked the easiest matter in the
world. Sir Tom and Lady Bridges were
making their first visit from S. Aus. —she a
small, rather trim-figured woman, who frocked
herself in white-spotted black foulard, with
a dash of cerise at the side drapings. With
the Prime Minister came Mrs. Bruce in
primrose linen and filet lace, shaded from the
sun by a big black crinoline hat. President
Hordern and his lady did the honors at the
tea-party, and Monty Somer piloted Dame
Margaret round, telling her yarns about his
American trip, her hearty laughter making
everyone ache to be in the joke too. Monty, to
whom running a mammoth show seems a
pleasant amusement, ended up the opening
day by lecturing on the shows he’d seen in
U.S.A*. and Canada, and, though it sounded
drier than a prohibition town, he kept his
audience, of country men and women, a-
ripple with laughter.
In elder sister’s day you got as many free
samples as you could carry away from the
Show. Times have changed. But for ss.
you can still fill auntie’s biggest peggy-bag.
Here is a favorite brand of tan boot-polish
in a penny tin ; there a penny will buy you
a bottle of lavender water. The progress of
the scent-and-powder business in Australia
seems to have been something that would
make the Harbor Bridge dizzy. And there’s
no call to say that Australia is casual in
the way it puts up these goods. In fact,
Australia is making such a multitude of
things that one wonders why the R.A.S.
doesn’t decide that this shall be an all-Aus-
tralian show—Australian and nothing else.
With the present medley of home-made and
imported, half the people who see the Aus-
tralian goods don’t recognise them as such,
and leave still ignorant of what their country
can give them.
There never before was such a collection
of Australian furniture inside one fence.
You could pick up quite a presentable bed-
room suite for £3OO and pay £GO extra for
the twin beds. A sycamore suite sent hun-
dreds away counting over the small change
in their pockets. Jarrah, beech, silky oak —
could such beautiful things come out of Aus-
tralia? And pianos and gramophones—
gramophones so silent that miraculously you
didn’t hear anything but what you were sup-
posed to hear.
You’ve heard hundreds of times of Portia
Holman, ex-I’remier William’s only daugh-
, ter; and this is her latest photo. Portia
Grenfell Holman, to
give the industrious
girl her full name;
Grenfell was pa’s
electorate in the
strenuous days
wherein she was
born. Now, while
still in her teens, she
has graduated in
Arts at Sydney
Uni.; and she has
entered and been
accepted at Cam-
bridge, so goes on to
Newnham at the end
of this year. Most
of her school educa-
tion she got at Shir-
ley, whose principal,
Miss Eva Saunders,
an M.A. of Sydney,
is a tremendous enthusiast for the higher
education of women. Whether Portia loves
best the garden that has been made for her
at the Mt. Wilson cottage or the Economics
in which she won distinction she could
hardly tell you ; but having had a good dose
of the latter (with a lot more to follow) she
is at present spending some happy months
among her flowers.
The Country Women’s Association has
made more than a creditable start; it has
done greater things in 11 months than most
women’s organisations achieve in 11 years.
Fortune smiled when she gave it Mrs. Hugh
Munro for a president—a frail, sweet-looking
woman, steel-knit with purpose, yet downy-
soft with sympathy for her bush sisters.
Dame Margaret’s opening of the conference
was no mere perfunctory act. She, too,
noticed that the man on the land —good fel-
low as he is—generally managed to get every
new 7 improvement, but let the housewife
w-orry along with the primitive utensils and
makeshifts of her pioneer grandma. To the
shades of those grandmas Dame Margaret
curtseyed low. “The deeds of the pioneer
men are recorded in history,” she said, “but
v 7 hat of those wonderful women who accom-
panied the men and wrought a measure of
comfort for them? They are never spoken
of, yet the loneliness and hardships of the
women on the land to-day give us just an
inkling of what their brave lives must have
been.”
After Mrs. Munro’s address Dame Mar-
garet invited the delegates to come and talk
matters over in Government House garden
on Thursday, and then she hurried off to
welcome the G.-G. and Sir Tom and Lady
Bridges, who were to be her guests over the
Easter festival.
Nancy Munro was the surprise of the
conference. The blue-eyed slip of a girl—
she is still in her teens—read the two tersest
papers of the session. She made a plea for
more comfortable seats for bush school-
children : and she almost wept over the rub-
bish supplied at country picture-shows.
“Give us educational films in the first half,
at any rate,” she pleaded. At one “child-
ren’s matinee” a while ago the whole first
part w r as taken —a ghastly hour of it—with
“Different Ways of Kissing.”
The garden party at Government House
was delightfully informal. Dame Margaret
sported her jacaranda-feathered hat and the
cream lace frock—her Show-opening rigout.
Miss Henderson ushered in the guests, and
Dame Margaret stood in the drawing-room
until she had given every one of ihe tit) Visi-
tors a grip. Then there was a walk-about,
everyone being entranced with the view.
Those guests who wished it were shown
over the house, and Sir Walter looked in
to tell a story or two about his pictured pre-
decessors. He had the most putable cocker
spaniel at his heels. Then he helped to
pass the tea around—that was when the
real party started on the verandah over-
looking the harbor.
While Good Friday roasted saints and
sinners alike, a big company of country
women were given the chance of sampling
what a God-given blessing Our Harbor is.
Mrs. Hugh Munro and Mrs. Matt Sawyer
ended up the week’s powwow by taking the
visitors for a water picnic, and the refresh-
ing breezes fired every woman from the back
o’ Bourke to put every ounce of fight and
influence into the Seaside Camps project.
There will be gorgeous frocking this danc-
ing season if the Easter Ball at the Went-
worth is an advance sample. There were
40 hosts and hostesses, the company of 250
being drawn mainly from Darling Point,
Bellevue Hill and Rose Bay. Three features
were outstanding. First, Miss Sydney has
at last accepted the dictum of longer sairts;
some of the beautiful satin gowns of flame
tints and warm pinks have floor-sweepers of
tulle and georgette. And, second (also three),
the plain style of hair-dressing and the scar-
city of hair-ornaments were as conspicuous
at one pole as the gaiety of the other : never
before have shoes been so trimmed and pat-
terned.
The Cavalier Club is at this moment em-
barking on the first dance of its iniant
career. The thing won’t differ much, except
as regards size, from the Golf f’lub dance.
Three-fourths of the male members belong
to the Union Club, and four-firths of the
literary and artistic members never turn up
at the Cavalier’s more solemn functions.
One care-free genius arrived as a member’s
guest at the monthly dinner the other night
without socks or collar. Since then the
social members have turned with warmer
and warmer sentiments of approval to the
more conventional geniuses—George Lam-
bert, Leon Gellert, Sid Smith and the like.
They would liefer die than go out to dine in
sandshoes.
The Rawson Institute which, as this
Letter mentioned last month, is on the finan-
cial rocks, is to be thrown a towline after
the races in the form of an amateur presen-
tation of Rudolf Besier’s play, “Lady
Patricia.” Handsome Barbara Knox will
play the part in which Mrs. Pat Campbell
starred in London, and her man will
be Kingsley Newell. Ernest Watt is to
present one of his favorite ecclesiastical in-
terpretations (on this occasion an Anglican
dean) ; Major Gordon Brady will be a comic
gardener, and Seb. Alison, Madge Cox and
Evelyn Maclcellar (a cousin of the poetess)
are other well-known folks in the cast.
Neville Mayman’s growing-up daughter
Phyllis has been making a little theatri-
cal niche for herself with the Oscar
Asche productions.
The violet-eyed
youngster is a
Heaven-born undei-
study, and can memo-
rise a part while
the doctor is still
diagnosing the sud-
den illness that has
drawn the lady bil-
led in the part from
the evening’s per-
formance. She is
know r n on the stage
as Phyllis May, and
is so close to a
beauty that only, an
expert in facial

find the flaws. Off-
stage the girleen is
a vivid talker, an
omnivorous reader, and something of a
writer.
At the French production of “Bluebeard’s
Eighth Wife,” at the Conservatorium on
Saturday nieht, Mrs. T. H. Kelly viewed her
fellow-stars from the front of the house during
the last act, and displayed a gorgeous gown
of oxidised tissue cloth patterned with velvet
ostrich plumes, with a dog collar of pearls
and diamonds round her neck. Sir Walter
was an interested spectator, and gave the
lead in laughs—he put the finishing touches
on his French lessons when he was in the
Diplomatic Service in Paris, and probably
did a lot of amateur acting—so it was quite
safe to guffaw after him. Sir Arthur and
Lady Stanley were his companions; Dajpe
Margaret took the other visitors, Sir Tfm
and Lady Bridges, to Harry Lauder’s braw
Scotch night at the Palh.ce. Mrs, George
Yivers’s perfectly coiffured fair head was the
most beautiful thing in the audience. Mrs.
Segaert viewed the unsophisticated acting ; of
daughter Henriette, who took all the bite
out of what might have been risque situa-
tions ; but one dear old soul looked on the
performance as anything but circumspect.
“Your French lessons immediately,”
she was heard to say to the young person
with her as the crowd hied out of the Lon-
servatorium. “But, auntie dear, there was
nothing in it, really; you know you couldn t
understand a word. ’ "Ao, my dear, l n
thankful to say that I couldn’t. But that
was the most immoral pair of pyjamas i
have ever seen!”
Four charming and gracious hostesses—
Mrs. George Vivers, Mrs. Worrall, Mrs. A.
J. Brady and Mrs. W. Collins (Q.)
300 guests to jazz on the verandah of the
Bose Bay Golf Clubhouse on Monday night
among tubs of orange-trees. Dame Margaret
Davidson, Lady Stanley and Lady Bridges
were the social lionesses of the evening, and
received the initial bobs of four pretty little
debs., Moira Brady, liuth Worrall, Lnid
Westmacott and Ann Jamieson. There were
to have been five, but the little Collins girl
was unfortunately too ill to attend.
Mrs. Emily Bennett, Mrs. Jamieson Wil-
liams and Dr. Ethel Remirey Morris went
off by the Omar as delegates to the V\ omen s
Suffragette Conference to be held in Borne
during May. The Women’s Reform League
sent Mrs. Bennett, Mrs. Williams is the
inter-State women's choice, and Dr. Morris
has the Women’s Union of Service at her
back. She is a gentle, sweet-faced little
lady, who put in years of service at the
Newington Old Women’s Home when her
most ardent desire was to be behind the
firing-lines in Trance. But there was no one
available to take Dr. Ethel’s job, so she
stuck to the old ladies. Her work there tillea
her gentle soul with the desire to establish
cottage homes for old people, so that married
couples may spend the evening of their days
together. The resulting project lias got from
Arthur Rickard, for a start, a fair slice of
land at Warrimoo, on which the first cottages
will be built—when the cash is available.
Many a Sydney grandma will have old
times recalled by the announcement of the
death, at Hurstville, of Miss Agnes Sarah
Phillips, in her 87th year. She was the
daughter of William Gerard Phillips, who
came from England in IS4O to South Aus-
tralia as providore to the old South Austra-
lian Company. Afterwards the _ family
moved to Sydney; and at _ Balmain Miss
Phillips opened a young ladies’ school, one
of the first in that suburb. To old pupils
she was always “Aunt Aggie.” Her fathers
family consisted of three sons and five
daughters, Mrs. Colley, a singer of some
note, being one —the mother of Miss Ada
Colley, a well-known vocalist of her day
and generation. .
Girls who did their gleaning at North
Sydney High want to institute a bursary
for the school. To talk the matter over they
are meeting at the Women’s Service Club,
114 Hunter-street, on Monday night.
Ethel Stephens having been chosen Queen
Bee of the Women Painters’ Club for 12
months, members brewed a dish of tea to
wet her installation, and invited a large com-
pany to the club rooms to share it. The
honey of snowy Easter daisies filled the air,
and colorful dahlias brightened the grey
room. Hon. sec. Winifred Betts welcomed
the new beacon, and also had appreciative
things to say about retiring president Hetty
(Dymock) Edwards and Mrs. Percy Paget,
chairmarm of the house committee.
This Thursday has a red mark on the
calendar —it’s for the demonstration of Dal-
croze Eurhythmies at the Conservatorium.
The lead will be taken by girls from Fren-
sham, the Mittagong school where real
eurhythmies are taught (there are eurhyth-
mies which are mere vamping, so to speak) ;
and Dame Margaret’s blessing will be upon
it and the good cause of Open Air Spaces
which it will aid.
Our G.-G.’s daughter, the war-widow of
the Hon. Harold Lubbock, has engaged her-
self to John William Pease, of. Wardington,
Banbury, where the Cross still stands in
the market square. The lady is tall and fair,
and has her handsome dad’s features and
Lady Forster’s sweetness.
The Sheldon knight and his lady and a
trio of daughters returned by the Moldavia.
Mamma and her girls have been absent
from Sydney for nearly four years, and have
acquired quite English complexions—to say
nothing of accents. The girls got up a
French doll set at the fancy-dress ball
arranged to cheer the passengers through the
stormy Bight. Uncle Tom Dalton went
aboard the steamer at Colombo to introduce
the new auntie to the family. The Moldavia’s
was an altogether pleasant homeward voyage.
Other returned wanderers were the William
Tilleys, of Burwood —father, mother and the
two girls.
The Ex-Service Women’s Club has taken
its powder-box and its good intentions to
the Blue Triangle Club, which is 423 Ivent-
street. The rooms are open every Thurs-
day from 3 to 7 p.m., and one of the com-
mittee is always there then to tell what it’s
all about.
Another item to make the younger genera-
tion of presswomen sigh. Teddy O’Loughlin.
the auburn-haired political roundsman of the
News, has induced Lylie Ryan to promise
to share a pressman’s strenuous life,
a typical Irish beauty who topped the poll
in the Government Service exam, a couple
of years ago. •

For the Gaud Mayoral Swansons’ civic
farewell to the tripping vice-regal Stradbroke
pair, the old city hall fairly grunted under
tons of pink and mauve garden produce, with
bright pink silk bandaging the balconies.
Mid-centre the usual fountain gushed from
a flowery mound, while a plantation of
tender gum-trees and tidy little flower-beds,
modestly outlined with purple asters, glad-
dened the platform. Mrs. Swanson’s brown
velvet upholsterings showed Oriental color-
ing on the port side of her waistline,' and her
brown hat sported a similar chromatic splash.
Lady Stradbroke suggested a graceful streak
of French mustard in old-gold silk sashed at
the hip angle, and a wide, brown-feathered
hat-brim shadowed all but her ever-ready
smile. A delicate hint was embodied in the
presentation boomerang, which she dangled
from one finger, letting the red roses at one end
see-saw with a posy of . violets at the other.
Little Lady Stanley, with fur outlining her
black-tailored effects, beamed from under a
small black hat. Speaker Mackey’s dame
wore brown wintry tailorings breasted with
yellow, and she had a dash of fur on her
toque. The chief Anglican Gaiter helped to
decorate the official row, with Mrs. Lees in
a blue-bag frock under a hat that was an
inky triumph.
Dozens of men wearing do-or-die expres-
sions above their best ties weighted the
gathering. Admiral Everett, in blue-and-gold
trappings, and with two uniformed supports,
came in when tea was on, and hovered shyly
in the offing until the official group had
landed back on the temporary throne. Gent-
help Keppe'l Palmer, just out from a few
days in hospital, was flank-guard to the
Gubernatorial party. A round thousand
attended the shivoo, and, away at the back,
Councillor Charlie Atkins, who is in the
running for next mayoral vacancy, drank
bohea with his wife and a group of pals, in-
cluding ex-Mayoress Stein.
The frocking in the Theatre Royal play
is one sustained and ravishing shriek in long
skirtings. Gertrude Elliott first reveals her-
self in black silk, caged in gold lace. Then
the golden meshes are lifted on the stage
(with a maid screening the indiscretion) to
make way for jade-green hangings, with
fringe dangling from georgette arm-curtains.
At the same time a huge scarlet comb is
hurriedly replaced by a green-backed one.
She next walks on in grey marocain, with
a regiment of buttons down the middle seam,
and grey astrachan roaming round the tunic
hem. Cherry color whispering through a
golden mist, caught midway with leaf-green
swathings and cherry-colored wings over
either ear, is jettisoned for a final triumph
of grey georgette, with cape effect picked out
at the edges in red beads. Lilian Walde-
grave spreads some enviable chiffonery, be-
ginning with glittering white fringe-beaded
effects, suggesting a frozen cascade. The
icicle suggestion is repeated in a beaded lilac
evening dress, and there are admiring gasps
when she finally unveils trailing geranium
velvet, clamped with a large gilded knob on
the lee side, under a satin wrap brocaded
with gold.
Up till 8 p.m. on Saturday Hugh Ward
was busily superintending the final touches
to Melbourne Palace. Men were nailing arm-
rests and tired charladies were swishing
feather-dusters while stallholders huddled in
the alleyways. Upstairs other toilers were
nailing drapery on to the boxes, and the
pink face of the manager wore a troubled
iook. However, everything was made ready
by 8.15. and the show started only half-an-
h’oqr after the advertised time. But it was
o close thing, and it was only bare justice
on Hugh Ward’s part at the end of the per-
formance to pay a tribute to the small army
that had got his theatre ready at record
speed. The newest Palace shows the same
fondness for cream as its big brother round
the corner in Spring-street. It has the same
sort of boxes and system of lighting, but it
boasts a green-gage curtain, and the seats
are upholstered in leather. The d.c. vesti-
bule is now more extensive, but the man-
agement has retained the old plan of conges-
tion by tumbling the d.c. and stalls into a
common exit.
A full house watched the first footsteps
of Bulldog Drummond, and considered him
a fine, athletic type with some resemblance
to tennis-player Gerald Patterson. Eve
Gray ingenued in mostly-drab trappings, but
there was a bluey-green evening gown in the
second scene of the first, act which didu t
chime with the pink wallpaper. The vamp,
Sylvia Shaw, struck a turquoise note in an
outdoor costume, but the play doesn’t give
her a chance to broach her wardrobe. Hugh
Ward, Mrs. Ward and architect White occu-
pied boxes, and there was a generous sprink-
ling of first-nighters in stalls and circle.
When it wasn’t occupied with the stage the
house divided its attention between Julius
Knight, a strange lady in a green wrap and
the gyrations of conductor Hamilton Webber,
who had apparently graduated in the kinder-
garten of J. P. Sousa.
The Prime Minister and Mrs. Bruce are
disbanding the Mayfair flat, and on landing
back from Sydney will unpack in the Charlie
Emmertons’ roomy South Yarra bungalow,
Wavendon, which they have hired for a period.
The doorbell promises to be worked overtime,
as a loud whisper says the Bruces will spread
many and various frivols of supreme quality.
.The National Council of Women gathered
in the Queen’s Hall the other afternoon to
show what they thought of Mrs. Glencross
and what she had done for them as organiser
and mover-in-cliief of the Housewuves’ Asso-
ciation. which job she has now handed to an
understudy. And they put it in the tangible
form of a diamond ring. The women are
calling for three cheers for the Association
now that their battle-cry, “Cheaper Sugar,”
has been answered by Priminister Spruce de-
claring the sugar bounty “off.” Meantime,
however, the cost of most other foodstuffs
doesn’t show any shrinkage. Mrs. Glencross,
who didn’t pretend not to be delighteff with
her ring, says she may be expected back in
action with her sister housewives when she
feels rested.
Singer Evelyn Scotney received the bless-
ing of the Austral Salon the other afternoon,
when Mrs. Rogerson, Mrs. Welsford Smith
and Violet Parkinson combined to hostess
an at-home party for her. The guest, who
was a delight in misty-grey touched with
silver from toe to hat-crown, came under
the wing of her proud mamma. The hos-
tessing trio flew distinguishing posies on
their wrists, and handed Evelyn a shower
of pink-and-blue blossonis. A constellation
of stars, headed by Francesca Duret, re-
leased a musical programme, with time off
for tea and cake. All the best Salonit<«
rolled up' of course, and everyone enjoyed
the affair immensely, even though the for-
mal rows of chairs did tend to dampen con-
versation,
A note from the Fog:—
A nne Williams, who has trained so many voices
at the Melba Con., chose a good time for her holi-
day in London. Most of her star pupils seem to
be here, and some are doing most successfully. Two
have been chosen to sing “Queen of the Night” in
Mozart’s “Magic Flute.” Gertrude Johnson appeared
in. .the idle while she was with the British National
Opera Co. She is one of tile few coloratura sopranos
who can sing the aria in the original key, which
soars to dizzy heights. Sow Margaret Jewell —less
well known here, but a promising singer—is to take
the part in the production at the old Vic.
Mabel Williams is
one of the promis-
ing students of the
Albert-street Con-
servatorium. Her
bent is composition,
and she already
has a couple of pub-
lished songs to her
credit. But her music
studies bid her put
such things aside for
a while. Her father,
the conductor of a
suburban church
choir, is a composer
of religious music
which has been per-
formed in various
places. The photo
was done by Rem-
brandt.
The Rutter Clarkes’ elder son, Geoff.,
married Susie Pender at the Collins-street
kirk under the eyes of a crowd of friends,
relatives and merely curious. The bride,
handed over by brother Roy, sported white
brocade girdled with pearls and silver roses,
a silky back curtain floating from one shoul-
der and a tulle veil bandaged with orange-
blossoms over the lot. Audrey Rutter Clarke
and Sammy Vincent bore posies of hydran-
gea and rustled in green brocade over silver
petticoats with green tulle veils floating
from silver wreaths. Brother Ken stood by
the ’groom. The cake and fizz were con-
sumed at Menzies’ before the bride climbed
into a grey-striped tailor-made with green
facings and a dhsh of green on her velvet
hat. The ancient superstition about green
at a wedding has no terrors for Susie.
The Sam Cookes’ young son Jim, after a
holiday with his parents at Toorak, has gone
back to the Queensland stat : on. where he
is learning all about the land. Before leav-
ing he persuaded the Arthur Ilasells’ second
chick, Dortee, to accbpt an engagement-ring
from him. Mrs. Hasell, who is tripping in
England and got the glad news by cable, has
only just recovered from an appendicitis
operation.
The Stephen Tullochs have coo-eed from
India that their ewe lamb, Oceana, otherwise
Winifred, is to marry a young Englishman,
Hugh Mackav, whose late father was m tne
Indian Civil Service. Oceana’s mother, who
was a St. Kilda Calder, is a grand-daughter
of one-time State Commandant Major-Gen-
eral Tulloch. The General and his wife lost
their only daughter during their stay in
Vic. She passed out after a terribly brief
illness on the eve of her departure for India
to marry an Indian Army captain.
Mrs. Peter Macpherson, who passed out
recently, will be greatly missed by both black
and white in the Riverina. She had a Knack
of getting the natives who camped on Paika
station to do things for her when they
would work for no one else. She christened
the piccaninnies,..clothed them and trained
then} as they got older to be useful servants.
Every year, when she took her children to
the seaside, she came back with a present
for each of her black friends. For the older
women she always bought clay pipes and
tobacco, and in return they presented her
with the choicest fish they caught in the
river, and counted it as something of an
honor if she asked them to feather poultry
for her. Incidentally, when one young nig.
was dying, his last request was for a bottle
of pickles, which Mrs. Macpherson at once
sent to him.
Herewith Jessie Shmith, the clever St.
Kilda girl who is making a name for herself
as a ballad-writer. Her star effort to date
is “Babe of Mine,’’
which has been
warbled to popular-
ity by Evelyn Scot-
ney and other con-
cert lights. The
composer, who is
now preparing to
launch a lilting
waltz song, supplies
both the music and
the lyrics. During
the hideous war sea-
son the indefatigable
Jessie worked her-
self and her fine
contralto voice over-
time in the Digger’s
cause. Her speci-
alty was the com-
pibnsr of natr ; oHi:
sing-songs to help
□inKe ! a ongiiier for our khakied
brothers in camp and hospital.
Mrs. George Officer passed out last week,
and genuine sympathy goes to her husband,
son and daughter. Mr. Officei-, who is in
Dalge'ty’s, is the eldest of the Kiverina
squatting clan. Mrs. Officer was a daughter
of the late Colin Simson, of Toorak. One
sister is the wife of Admiral Heath, another
married a Pairbairn, and the only one now
in Australia is Mrs. de Little, of Camper-
down.
That rendezvous of Western District
squatters, the Geelong Club, has lost its
aristocratic-looking sec., Henry Blomfield
Brown, who passed out after a tragically
short illness. He got his second name from
his grandfather, the late Dr. Blomfield,
Bishop of London. His widow is a sister
of Tommy Wills, who took the first team of
Australian cricketers —abos. —to England.
Wills, sen., was killed by the blacks in
Bananaland half-a-century ago.
Mrs. Osborne, wife of the Melbourne ’Var-
sity Prof, of Physiology, has just gained her
medical degree. Before she came to Vic.
the studious lady had bagged an M.Sc. at
Leeds’Varsity. Utterly domesticated, she keeps
a close supervision over her household affairs,
spares time to rule the cookery and home
arts colleges in Lonsdale-street and Fitzroy,
and is the real pal of her own kiddies.
Marie Tiernan, M.A., LL.B., and Marie
Cleary, with a similar tag, recently com-
pleted their law course, and wifi shortly be
licensed to make up bills of their own. Miss
Tiernan received her early education at the
Presentation Convent, Windsor, and was
then a brilliant student of Newman College.
Miss Cleary, a Brigidine girl, distinguished
herself by taking her two degrees simultane-
ously, and she did most of her study after
day-teaching. The two Maries, who are
close friends, are now considering the queer
ways of Parliamentary and other males in
a Collins-street office.
A story is told of an actor who went away
from a special feed the other evening with a
small cube of cheese as a souvenir for his
wife, who loves the delicacy in a walking
state. The comestible was a fair sample of
the active sort, and for greater convenience
the mummer wrapped the morsel in a menu
and tied it to his finger. Coming to a club
where a nightcap can be had on demand, he
breasted the bar with his parcel, and was
immediately hailed by a popular comedian
who wanted full particulars of the “find.”
“That,” said the actor-r, holding up his prize,
“is a little bit of cheese for my de-ah little
wife.” It must be quite 30 years since the
lady deserved the second of the tender adjec-
tives. So the whole company guffawed when
the comic man said plaintively: “The mean
hound is keeping her in a mouse-trap.”
Some of the younger members of the Idle
Classes are now having a rare chance to con-
firm their secret suspicions regarding their
genius for screen work. Hay Whiting has
lined them up in a scenario of his own in-
vention, and, with complexions that look like
a massed tribute to a wild day off the Leeii-
win, they are rushing from garden to garden
pursued by a camera in the hands of l-.es
McCallum. The film is to be unwound in
the cause of Charity.
The 22-year-old Earl of Northesk, who is
preparing to offer the overworked family
coronet to an ex-Zeigfeld Follies charmer, is
a son of that Lord Rosehill who spent over
a year as a gent.-help in this city ’way back
in Hopetoun’s State-Governoring days, and
tottered on the brink of sharing his title
with a local belle.
Adelaide drops a line or two: —
TlSeir Exes, put in a busy day on the Saturday
before Easter. The A.R.C. races first, then polo,
then the Oval for the last games of the tennis tour-
nament, and in the evening the Limbless Soldiers
Association concert at the Town Hall. On Monday
they left for a week’s visit to the Davidsons in
Sydney, lunching with the Forsters in Melbourne on
the way.
The Allan MacFarlanes’ eldest son —also Allan,
and the State’s crack amateur rider —is engaged to
Eileen Nicholas, from Oorowa, in the Ma State.
Here as a visitor is Miss Valesca Reimann, whose
father once taught music in Adelaide. She is a
teacher herself, but her line is classics, which she
has taught at Trinity College, Kandy (Ceylon), for
eight years. Among her fellow-passengers was Dr.
Edwin Crozier, who has just annexed his medical
degree in England, where he has been since his
schooldays. .
His Ex. is to have a new gent.-help —Major N.
Clowes, D. 5.0., M.C. He won’t be the first of the
name at Government House. During the Le Hunte
regime Miss Clowes, a cousin of Lady Le Hunte,
was her unofficial secretary.
The Repertory Theatre has blossomed into a Club,
which is to meet fortnightly, and has lectures from
Paddy Glynn, Prof. Coleman Phillipson and Dr.
Heaton down on its winter programme. It was
opened t’other evening (its rooms are in Pirie-street,
under the respectable wing of the Salv’army Citadel),
with Prof. Phillipson and Archibald Strong as chief
speakers, a short play and a song or two.
Poloists have been having a hectic time, with play
most days a week at Birkalla, and a violent round
of morning and afternoon teas, dinners and lunches,
Palais parties and theatres in the intervals. Vic-
torian visitors include the Claude Palmers, W. B.
Cummingses, Keith Urquharts, Miss Affleck, Miss
Mann and her sister, as well as the unaccompanied
males, John Manifold and Keith Calvert. Mrs. Barr
Smith hostessed the tea on the “big” day, when the
crowd was a record one.
Mrs. A. C. Dobbie and Nora Stewart were joint
hostesses at the at-home to which people were
bidden to see something of Morna Dobbie’s dancing.
She is fresh from work in London under Margaret
Morris and Astafeiva, and gave the onlookers highly-
varied fare, including a Chinese dance that was the
quaintest ever.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Our Excellency considered a life on the ocean wave
for the week-end aboard Jimmy Love’s boat Sweet-
heart. He had come back from the North Coast
line on the Friday, and filled in the interval with
a dinner-party at Government House and an appear-
ance at the Philharmonic’s concert," conducted by Eric
Johns, in the Exhibition Hall.
President O. B. E. Rothwell said “Hullo” to a
number of other motorists at Fig Tree Pocket on
the 24th. Egg-and-spoon races suitable for Lent,
sack races “for gentlemen” and musical chairs for
girls filled the sports programme. Vice-president
Johnson handed out the prizes, and the teacups
chinked under the trees, while half social Brisbane
gathered round them.
Humphrey Bishop’s performers are going in for
all-round new frocking this week. Grace Savieri is
an Egyptian frieze; Louise Meadows is all paradise
plumes; Ivy Moore is as feathered as the movie-
show Indian, and May Geary sports monkey-fur on
on her Pbiret model.
Matron Chatfield, of the Diamantina, was
feasted at the Bellevue, amid red roses and dahlias,
by fellow-nurses, while a pink ahtignum was trained
into an expression of goodwill over her chair. The
affair was a send-off in view of the matron’s holiday
trip to the Cold Country;
The Queensland Authors and Artists' Assoc, -is
arranging an entertainment for the invalid Diggers
at Ardoyne, and vice-president “Steele Rudd’s”
monthly magazine is to become an accomplished fact
in April. (Not on the Ist.)
The A. H. Whittinghams and Margaret Ross
Munfo ate their hot-cross buns in Sydney this year,
and a large number of Brisbane folk flavored theirs
with salt water at the Tweed, Redcliffe and Scar-
borough. Of course, there was the customary
fashion parade at Southport.
Mrs. Wessie Walsh has gone to Sydney, and the
Sutherlands are on the Narkunda, bound for Europe.
As a good-bye to the David Hamilton dame Mrs.
C. Dixon captured the lounge at Lennon’s for a
monster tea-drinking, amid white lilies, carnations
and gerberas. Wives and daughters of prominent
ones turned up in force, among them the Cecil
Palmer lady, Mrs. Espie Dods, the Whites, Hal-
fords, Glyn-Conollys and Cullens.
Stanhope Hobday filled the Sheldon Gallery with
pastorals in paint the other day- He had a sug-
gestion for breaking all droughts in “The Coming
Storm,” with an effective yellow hill thrown in,
and “Showery Weather” to follow. The “Sentinel”
gum-tree sheltered a good deal of pleasant comment.

Before the first race at Randwick on
Saturday the Doncaster betting was 9 to 2 Fleuriste,
10 to 1 bar one. In his final gallop on Thursday
morning the English-bred horse had run a mile in
lmin. 42-jsec., whereupon Eric Connolly, not
previously confident, backed him solidly, the owner’s
lead being followed by other big Melbourne punters
and the public. At the close of operations 7 to 2
was hard to get, whereas Duke Isinglass,. Sir
Maitland and Easingwold were quoted at 12’s, All
Gold and Gplden Treasure at 14’s, Inia’s Boy and
Whittier at 16’s, The Epicure at 25’s and Etive at
33’s. The -favorite had every chance —a decent
marble, a good start and an unhampered run all
the way—but he was never nearer than sixth, his
position at the finish. Naharadan (20’s) and Golden
Treasure made most of the running but both were
done with at the end of seven furlongs. Then
Whittier hit the front, with Imputation and All
Wheat handy, and Duke Isinglass, Etive and The
Epicure coming fast. The weight told on the
V.A.T.C. Derby winner and, just when Munro, on
Duke Isinglass, thought he had everything else
settled. The Epicure flashed up on the rails, through
an opening left by the tiring three-year-old, and
landed the “stake by half-a-length. Etive was a
neck off third, Whittier a close fourth, and
after a patch of daylight came the 100-to-l-chance
All Wheat, Fleuriste, Cool Light and Oranian, the
time being lmin. 38lsec. Toohey, who rode the
winner, was successful on Julia Grey last year and
Speciality in 1921—a record that may not be dis-
turbed for half-a-century.
The Epicure is trained by W. Booth at Rosehill
and owned by J. O. Peterson, who keeps a pub about
a mile from the Randwick course. Peterson has been
very successful on the turf. In Perth (W.A.) years
ago he made a pot of money with a horse called
Enchanteur, and with P. A. Connolly he bought
Lilyveil in 1913 to ensure the second leg of a big
double which the pair had taken —Artesian for the
Perth Cup and Lilyveil for the W.A.T.C. Railway
Stakes. A fetv months
after w'inning the Rail-
way the English horse
ran away with the
Sydney Cup. Peterson
is reported to have
collected £lO,OOO on
The Epicure, besides
the stake. The horse
had run shockingly at
Rosehill a week before,
finishing behind third-
raters like Kurnell
Belle and Cugo in the
first division of the
Highweight Handicap,
so the public neglected
him —also it mostly
forgot to cheer when
the winner returned to
the weighing enclosure.
There was no inquiry
as to the reason for the
sudden improvement.
S. KILLICK, the
Newcastle
(N.S.W.) trainer.
Beauford is a mem-
ber of his string.
Ciserta let his admirers down badly in the A.J.C.
St. Leger. Always at odds on, he was fairly out-
stayed by James Wilson’s Woorak-Lady Joan colt,
Sir Andrew (4’s), who romped home lengths ahead
of the favorite and the Queensland horse Kingslot
in the fast time of 3min. 2sec. After the race
Caserta was palpably off color, and he was promptly
scratched for the Sydney Cup. Furious also disap-
pointed in the Autumn Stakes. The slow pace should
have suited her, but she failed over the last furlong,
and Speciality (7’s), who has a brilliant short
finishing run of which Pike made effective use, just
pipped David on the post, with Rivoli a fair third.
It was a good Cup trial on David’s part, seeing
that he had led all the way until the last 100 yards,
but the public thought The Cypher’s performance in
the 12-furlong Total Handicap a better. Mufti was
favorite, and she might have won if her Melbourne
rider hadn’t made too much use of her—a common
fault with Victorian horsemen at Randwick. But
she was done at the distance, and the three-year-old
(backed from 10’s down to half those odds) got up
in time to shove half his frame ahead of unlucky
Tremolo, Bitalli being a fast-finishing third.
In the course betting on the Cup, Heir Apparent
whs favorite at 7 to 2, half-a-point shorter than
The Cypher. After the pair came Bitalli (8 s),
Rivoli and Sir Andrew (12’s), Mufti (14’s), David,
King Ingoda, Oranian and Speciality (20’s), and
Prince Charles (25’s), with the rest 33 to 1 and
better. Among the 100 to 3 batch was the imported
horse Shillinglee, who was conspicuous at the head
of the field for a mile and three-quarters and finished
resolutely in third position. But the race was
mostly David and Heir Apparent. They were never
farther back than fourth or fifth and a mile from
home they were galloping so easily, a few lengths
from the leader in a strung-out field, that it was
clear one or other would win. When the straight
was reached for the second time it looked as if it
would be Heir Apparent. But, in opposition to
Lewis’s policy of coming away early—a method which
has succeeded brilliantly with brilliant horses like
Artilleryman—Wood waited for the last run on
David and got it —on the inside. Carrying his 9st.
71b. as if it were a featherweight, the big black
galloped past the post a length ahead of Heir
Apparent and another half-length in front of Shilling-
lee, with The Cypher, Rivoli, Happy Queen, Oranian
and Prince Cox next in that order. The time
was on the slow side- —3min. 261 sec.
David belongs to O. R. Falkiner, who had several
healthy wagers on him, and, like The Epicure, is
trained by the shrewd Booth. A magnificent speci-
men of the old-style Australian thoroughbred, he is
as hard as nails and can stay for a week. In his
veins courses the blood of Wakeful and Instep. Yet,
because Australian sires are stupidly neglected nowa-
days in favor of cheap English importations, he was
sold as a yearling for 40 guineas. He has returned
his various connections at least a thousand times
that figure in stakes and bets.
The coterie of Melbourne punters who bet in
thousands must be having a good meeting.
The Doncaster and the Cup were bad races for them,
but they won harrels of boodle on Gulgo in (he First
Hurdle, The Cypher in the Toeal Handicap,
Fleuriste in the Flying Handicap on the second day,
and Purser in the Highweight. The last was
backed from 15’s down to s’s, by Corteen, Godby and
co., who got back the pile they dropped on the son
of Sea Prince—Paper Money in the Metropolitan,
with compound interest.
* ■ * * *
“The Deacon”: A gamble much favored
by dead-game sports on the way to the races is a
couple of bob in and guess the number of greys be-
tween Sydney and the course. The nearest guesser
takes the lot. On the road to Warwick Farm there
were two mugs in my car and they put down respec-
tively 8 and 12. Then the older birds began
betting on 40, 50 and 60. One of the 60’s
collared the pool.
* -X- * *
“Alex. Val” : At the recent Brisbane year-
ling sales a man who knows less about horses than
a lot of other things was admiring one of the
youngsters. Getting into conversation with the
owner, he pointed to his tin-lizzie and remarked that
he was willing to swap. The owner declined. It
was the Shepherd King—Miss Muriel colt, and he
was knocked down at 1300 guineas.
* * * *
“Doc. B.”: Tenders are invited in the
Brisbane papers for the purchase of John Wren’s
Kedron Park (Q.) pony racecourse—Albion Park and
Sandgate, his two registered courses, have already
been sold to the Brisbane Amateur Turf Club. The
excuse given out is that John is a very sick man,
but evilly-disposed folk believe that the rush election
has something to do with the market being “graced”
with this (as the ad. naively puts it) “seat of a
highly remunerative business.” Seeing that the
crowd which throws the continuous Ministry off the
premises will have to deal drastically with the over-
racing curse, the “highly remunerative” part of the
business is liable to sudden changes without notice.
* * * ‘ *
Adelaide, which was beginning to fancy
itself at polo after the recent success of a (three-
fourths country) S.A. team in Victoria, went down
badly on the city ground, with a city team, against a
visiting four from across the border. The visitors
were John Manifold, J. do L. Affleck, Keith Urquhart
and W. R. Gumming, and the combination of youth
and experience made a brilliant team. The home
side had an unaccountable day-off, and was beaten
10 to 4.
* * * *
“Whitehall”: A row very similar to the
Dooley-McGirr disturbance was agitating the sport-
ing world of England when the last mails left, the
chief difference being that the central figures are not
nearly so outspoken as to basic causes as N.S.W.’s
Labor intriguers were. The guerdon involved is
the Mastership of the Whaddon Chase hounds, and
the would-be M.F.H.’s are respectively Lord Dal-
meny and Colonel Selby-Lowndes. Lord Dalmeny
is the choice of the executive, or hunt committee,
while Colonel Selby-Lowndes was selected by a large
majority of the hunt, or Parliamentary pa rty. The
milk in the cocoa nut is, as often happens in Ena-
land, an affair of local patriotism. And, in addi-
tion, the personal equation and anti-Semitism enter
into the business. The AVhaddon Chase hunts
in Buckinghamshire, a county which for various
reasons —chief among them probably being its
proximity to London —has long bpen the haunt of
millionaire Hebrews. The Bucks Yeomanry at the
beginning of the war was almost entirely officered
by Jews, or semi-Jews, and a goodly proportion of
them were Rothschilds. Lord Dalmeny is a Roths-
child on his mother’s side (his father is, of course,
Lord Rosebery), and hence is more or less accurst in
the opinion of the Selby-Lowndes family, who have
lived at Whaddon Hall bv the Ouse since about the
time the ancient Roman Watling-street was laid down
in the vicinity. A Selby-Lowndes has been master
of the Whaddon Chase off and on for generations,
and the present aspirant is as personally popular as
his rival is the reverse. On the other hand Lord
Dalmeny is a hard and capable rider to hounds; he
is immensely rich, and, when his valetudinarian
father dies, he will be rich beyond the dreams of
avarice. And Bucks is essentially a county where
money talks. So the betting, on the whole, is on
Lord DalMcGirr, the butter-in.
* * * *
Norman Brookes is having a hard job in
selecting the Australian team for the Davis Cup.
Patterson, O’Hara Wood, Hawkes and Wertheim
became definitely unavailable a long time ago, and
of the colts who were approached, Schlesinger and
Melnnes (Vic.), Kalms and Spencer (N.S.W.), and
Stuart and Hone (S.A.), only Schlesinger and Stuart
were willing to make the trip. But Jim Anderson
and Norman Peach are willing to cross the Pacific
again, so there is a strong possibility of the Com-
monwealth winning the first tie with Hawaii and
then meeting Argentina or Japan. A team composed
of Anderson, Peach, Schlesinger and Stuart hasn’t
much chance on paper of reaching the challenge
round. Anderson may be relied upon to do his bit,
but none of the others seems likely to capture a
singles match from the Japs, though Anderson and
Peach may score in the doubles. Summed up, only
fine form on the part of Anderson will enable Aus-
tralia to meet the winner of the European tourney
for the right of encountering Uncle Sam once more
in New York.
* * * *
“Cecil F. T.”: “Linesman’s” reference
(B. 22/3/’23) to the Melbourne Grammar School
producing tennis champions suggests other names.
Theyre Weigall, president Vic. Tennis Association, is
an old Melburnian, as well as J. F. Koch, secretary,
and J. S. Wilson, treasurer. Cam Hammond,
veteran umpire; Rod Heath, international player;
Reg. Fraser, E. F. Herring (tennis blue, Oxford),
Cecil and Noel Heath, Jack McComas, Baynes Dick-
son and E. D. Yencken (both tennis blues of Cam-
bridge) were all trained at Grammar, in addition
to the cracks mentioned by “Linesman” —Brookes,
Rainey, Wertheim, Schlesinger and O’Hara Wood.
* * * *
Gerald Patterson proved too good for a
crowd of tennis opponents in Adelaide, and won out-
right the E. T. Smith cup, given as long ago as
1910. His toughest fight was with Rainey (Vic.),
but Hone (S.A.) took a set from him, which was more
than Melnnes (Vic.), the other finalist, could do. In
the doubles, Patterson and Thomas beat Stuart (as
brilliant as anyone on the court) and “King” Roberts,
a clever player who does not hit quite hard enough
for the championship class. The tournament had an
Australian record for entries and eight days of
literally perfect weather.
* * * *
By way of encouraging country cricket
the Sydney Association brought a whole four provin-
cial teams to the capital last week, and got some-
thing to think about when a selected country XI
beat a strong city side (it included four inter-
Staters) by 320 to 232. For the conquerors L.
Sieler (Marulan) collected 70, mostly by vigorous
drives and clean ground strokes ; and H. Mills (Port
Kembla), 56, and A. Bice (South Coast), 57, also
shaped well. But the deepest impression v'as made
by C. Morrissey (Singleton), the G.P.S. field-games
crack. Bowling fast-medium with a capital length
and spin, Morrissey got 4 for 51. He had previously
taken 5 for 38 v. South Coast and 4 for 37 v. West,
besides showing excellent form with the bat and in
the field. Other notable efforts were those of F.
Payne (Tamworth), 149, v. West; Eric Bonnor
(Orange), a nephew of George, the old international,
103 v. North; P. Siddall (Albury), 119 (including
one sixer and 18 fours), and H. Mills (Port Kemhla),
a slow bowler, who took 16 wickets, averaging 21.5,
during the matches. If the Sydney Association only
looked after the country cricketers half as well as
the Melbourne people do, it mightn’t have to periodi-
cally lament its lack of class bowlers.
* * *• *
“The Deacon”: Acute rheumatism kept
old Bill Howell out of country cricket for some
years, but he has been at it again. Playing for
Castlereagh, a Nepean (N.S.W.) club, Bill knocked
up a sparkling 135, including five sixers and 21
fours. Four young Howells took part in the
massacre.
* * * *
Against Waverley, who are leading for the
Sydney premiership, Hornibrook, the Toombul (Q.)
left-hander, took 6 for 66. Waverley won by 73
on the first innings, but returned south convinced
that, in Gregory’s absence, Hornibrook has no superior
in the Commonwealth.
* * * *
Club cricket in Adelaide ends with East
Torrens again easily on top, but they do not head
the individual averages. Dr. Dolling, coming into
cricket again after a long absence, made more runs
than have ever been made before in a season, 856.
Rundell, who did not play often, had the flattering
average of 175, and Lewis, a new discovery, was top
of the regular players with 73. Fisher, the new
University fast bowler, took most wickets. There
were some freak bowling averages among those who
sent down only an over or two, but Arthur Richard-
son stands right out with 41 wickets at 12, and a
hatting average of 55. He would pretty certainly
have topped Fisher’s aggregate but for going down
with mumps in the middle of the last club game.
* * * *
“Tron”: Victorian public-schools cricket
suffers from the lack of bowlers. The poorness of the
trundling in the recent matches made centuries as
common as capeweed. Ben Dunlop, captain of Mel-
bourne Grammar, reached the hundred in each of the
games played—l 76, 105 not out, 145 —and for five
innings had an aggregate of 458 and an average of
114.5. Ben is a versatile youngster, and inherits so
much tennis ability from bis father, Alf Dunlop, that
this sport may claim him, as it did another good
cricketer in Gerald Patterson. A more consistent
player is Carl Schneider, captain of Xavier, who,
though only 17, has won ,an inter-State cap. His
aggregate for five innings was the same as Dunlop’s,
458, with scores of 105, 137, 82, 78 and 56, averaging-
-91.6. His googlies, too, got him a lot of wickets, and
the hat trick against Scotch was his third in
public-schools matches. A shrewd captain and a bril-
liant field at cover or mid-off, he this year carried
Xavier, undefeated, to the top of the list. Undoubt-
edly he is Victoria’s most promising colt. F. Phillips,
of Scotch, made 115 and 107 ; J. Bryant, of Melbourne
Grammar, 191 and 97, and with Dunlop against Gee-
long College established the record partnership of
376, beating that of 345 by R. W. Herring and J.
Sharp, made in 1915. Young Crockett, son of Aus-
tralia’s best umpire, is also a good cricketer, who
always performs well for Wesley with both bat and
ball. Fairly consistent bowlers were Mayers of
Geelong Grammar, Moran of Melbourne Grammar,
and Rusden of Geelong College; but taking them
all in all the trundlers were a moth-eaten crowd.
* * * *
“Winkle”: Jim Phillips, the old Aussie
umpire, was a man who made cricket history. Before
his time many county teams played fast bowlers who
often threw, and English umpires were chary of no-
balling them. But Phillips truckled to no man. He
persistently no-balled the offenders, and it became
unprofitable to play confirmed throwers, while those
who lapsed into unfairness occasionally had to drop
the indiscretion. Nowadays it is impossible for a
“jerker” to be picked for a first-class match.
"Floreat New”: “Linesman’s” par. (B.
22/3/’23) .re Dr. Curtis’s batting for Ballarat
in the Vic. country-cricket week, takes me back to
happier days. In 1893 Newington, by defeating
Sydney Grammar, won the G.P.S. premiership, and
it was Dr. Curtis (we knew him as “Schnapper”)
who skippered the team and knocked up 62 of the
best. Entering Sydney Uni. he devoted his spare time
to tennis, and while there he won the N.S.W. singles
championship. His career, however, was (.ut short
by ill-health, and he was forced to abandon both
the game and his studies. Some years later he
entered Adelaide Uni. and came away with his
degree. Knowing him as I did (I was in the New-

This contemplative young man is Harry
Lowell, of Seddon (Vic.), whose only vices are play-
ing the mandolin and taking his sister to' picture-
shows and theatres. He has never smoked in his
life, neither has he tasted the wine that is red. At
13 he decided to become a boxer. At 16 he was
appearing in amateur bouts after his day’s work as
an apprentice in the engineering trade. To-day he
is known as Jimmy Semmens, the cleverest bantam-
weight Melbourne has produced since the days cf
Jimmy Anthony and Micko Walsh.

The Easter fights at the Sydney Stadium
were in no way thrilling. On Saturday flyweight
George Mendies knocked out the much heavier Les
Waters in the 15th round. Waters shaped 'listlessly,
and had to be carried from his corner to his. dressing-
room after the Portugee stopped him. The young-
ster is plucky enough, but he lacks stamina, and
should quit the game before it quits him. On
Monday night Alf Stewart, the Victorian middle-
weight, outpointed Jack Cole a mile, but the referee
gave it a draw. Apart from Stewart and His seconds
nobody objected, the proceedings having bored the
small crowd stiff. No doubt the referee was bored
too. »

The Soccer people in South Aus. are mak-
ing a strong effort to capture the schools, and the
Adelaide League, at a recent meeting, said it would
have to counter these tactics with prdselytising
efforts on its own account, as foreign competition
must be met. Then a branch of the Society of St.
George expressed solemn regret at “the applica-
tion of the term ‘foreign’ to any British institu-
tion.” It was testily reminded that the Soccer experts
mostly brought the game with them from the other
side of the world, and had recently protested against
a suggestion to establish the District system on the
ground that this would “AustraTianise” their sport.
There was a time when Soccer nearly ousted the
Australian code from the Westralian schools. But
the Australian-rulers (mostly A.N.A. men) rallied and
regained the fort.

“Hull”: The attendances at British Soccer
football matches grow more amazing each year. The
Gup semi-finals attracted over 120,000 people (the
offertories exceeded £13,000), and it musi be re-
membered that the semi-finals are always played in
provincial towns. A London club —West Ham —-having
fought its way into the final means a capacity crowd
for the new ground at Wembley, where the Empire
Exhibition is raising its head. This arena is reported
to be big enough for 125,000. It will be thoroughly
tested on April 21.

Four Digger-nthletes— E. W. Carr. K.
Rowling (N.S.W)), D. IV. Gale and W. E. McMillan
(Vic.) —are off to Sweden to compete in the Gothen-
burg games and thence to London to take part in an
Imperial ex-servicemen’s tourney. The experience
■should do Carr all the good in the world., He only
needs a slight improvement in his style to enter
the world’s champion class. Rowling is a well-built
middle-distance runner; at an A.I.F. meeting in
Sydney last week he won the quarter-mile in
52 4-ssec. Gale holds the 100yds. (10 ’ l-10sec.)
and 440yds. (51 3-10 see.) Vic. championships, and
McMillan owns the ’Varsity half-mile and mile titles ;
he has also done well in hurdles and field games.
The Swedish affair will be held in July.
* * * *
“Wilfrido”: At the Otago (MX.) Uni.
sports young Porritt, who ran well against Carr and
Kirksey, had a day out. The 100yds. he won in
10 l-ssec., the 120yds. hurdles in 16sec. and the
220yds. in 23 3-ssec.- —all three times creating new
UnL records for M.L. Porritt is the latest M.L.
Rhodes Scholar. J. B. McMiken cleaned up the
440yds. hurdles in 63sec., and G. R. King cleared
sft. 6in. in the high jump.
“Nimshi”: Remarkable the number of
Australian champions whose names begin early in the
alphabet. In swimming we have Beaurepaire and
Charlton ; in cycling Broadbent, Dempsey and Daniels;
in footrunning, Carr; in lawn tennis Anderson and
Miss Boyd ; and in boxing, Dwyer. Also Armstrong
and Collins may be fairly classed as cricket cham-
pions, representing, as they do, past and future
captaincy; and Eric Apperley comes into the picture
as a golfer. Then, again, in the equine world.
Beauford is king.
I SHALL BE GLAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I shall be glad when the Winter comes
With its short, dark days and its cold wet winds ;
AA hen rain on the Sydney pavement drums,
And macintoshes, like yellow blinds,
Transfigure the forms of the surfing girls
To the semblance of shapeless blobs ;
When again an easterly blizzard whirls,
And the troubled ocean moans and sobs.
I shall be glad when the first mad blasts
Tear up from the south and the news is starred
That, so long as such icy weather lasts,
The use of electric stoves is barred.
For err Summer’s end is England’s Spring,
And Spring ends English hunting, 'of course,
And the futile items the cables bring
Of the Prince’s daily fall from his horse.

“Kelvin”: “Ashmead” (B. 8/3/’23) dilates
on France’s generosity in allowing him to
travel a la civvy on her railways on a sol-
dier’s fare. Well, there were others. In
a R.N. uniform, I more than once travelled
first-class on the Italian railways from end
to end, on a naval pass, which stipulated
second-class only, and no wagon lit. Inci-
dentally, Italians detecting the R.N. uniform
would invariably fight shy of the compart-
ment, leaving me lord of all I surveyed.
Dunno whether it was from fear or respect.
Possibly the latter. I’m not unlike Beatty.
Uncle Sam’s prohibition has had one queer
effect: it has hit Australian hop-growers in
the eye. Last year Tasmanian growers be-
sought Rodgers, then Minister for Customs,
to save them from being choked by Yankee
competition. Rodgers suggested co-opera-
tion with the brewers, and recently the lat-
ter agreed to take local hops as required,
but asserted that a percentage of the im-
ported article was essential. Austin Chap-
man, Minister for Customs, has now told
the local producers that the best he can do
for them is to prohibit the use of more than
15 per cent, of imports in local brews.
“Flicker” has his bad moment: —
“Dr. Nil” in his remarks on the behavior of
persons under an anaesthetic (B. 15/3/’23) reminds
me of one of my most embarrassing moments. I
had occasion to part with a couple of teeth, and
the Torquemada who was to do the job insisted on
giving me gas. Assisted by an exceptionally dainty
nurse, he duly administered the stuff, and I suddenly
found myself sauntering through the lounge of the
Grand Central Hotel wearing nothing but a small
singlet. I asked the manager for a match and a
palm-tree fell on my head, so I started to say what
I thought of the place—in A.I.F. language. I woke
with my voice, but not the words, still sounding in
my ears. The dentist was grinning like a cracked
plate, and the nurse .was the color of wild roses at
dawn. Neither the jaw-breaker nor his female acces-
sory will ever tell me what 1 said, but I fear the
worst, and nurse still giggles when we meet.
“Womerah” is aggrieved
The Commonwealth booby-trap officers are going the
limit in electoral matters. I arrived in a certain
town in the Ma State late in January, in very
poor health, and almost immediately had to relin-
quish duty for a fortnight. These interesting per-
sonal items were published in the local rag. This
first week in March, after having such a cheap
advt., I found the booby-trap administrator had me
labelled. I got a Regulation 18 summons desiring
me to state how I wish to be dealt with for fail-
ing to insert my name on the electoral roll. The
joke is that not only have I voted religiously at
every election since I was 21, but have held respon-
sible posts on every occasion. A regulation that
makes law-breakers of such ultra-conscientious citizens
as myself is one with the worst features of the
customs at the court of the famous Tinker of
Fassifern.
“F. Clinton”: Go on the land, young man,
but don’t expect to get-rich-quick there. The
following is the experience of a farmer who,
with his wife, son and two daughters, works
a farm in the Tamworth district (N.S.W.).
In 1916 he cleared £297, 1917 £2lB and in
1918 £447. In 1919 and 1920 he lost £95
and £124, but in 1921 he made £463, and in
1922 £262. The average is £2lO per annum
for the continuous labor of two people and
the occasional labor of the* three others. If
the cocky had had the cash value of his pro-
perty and put it out on mortgage he would
have made that much year in and-year out
without any worry about droughts and
floods. Meantime he and the son could have
got work in the city at not less than the
basic wage. The old chap is thinking of
quitting. Should he do so Sydney will be five
nearer to the million mark. But there will be
five less to sustain the tremendous burden of it.
“Malua” on the Chinese invasion of Fiji:
The present outburst in Fiji against the Chow
merely bears out an article of mine that The Bul-
letin published in 1919. When Quong Fat first
started in ’ business in Fiji he was encouraged by
most of the wholesale firms and even given better
terms than white traders on account of his being an
invariably good pay. But when he learned, as he
very soon did, to employ white clerks and indent his
own goods, the big firms realised their shortsighted-
ness. So rapidly did the Chinese trading stations
increase that in 1920-21, when the copra market was
weakening, the white trader in some centres was
badly beaten by the yellow man and outbid at
copra buying. Small European traders have in many
cases been outed completely by Chinese competition.
A worse evil is miscegenation. The Chinese do not
bring their women with them, and whenever one
moves he has a habit of leaving his native consort
and acquiring a new one ; so the islands are being
sprinkled with neglected half-castes. Naturally the
people who are wailing loudest now are the very
ones who welcomed Ah Cheap and his money years ago.
The Territory housewife has worries too:
After I had been about 10 weeks in the N.T.
I reckoned I knew everything worth knowing about
Binghi. Now, after a decade and a half, I’m just
beginning to realise my colossal ignorance. No
one can know the nigger, unless she has nigger
blood in herself. Lately, I’ve had three “boys”
working for me, Jack, Harry and Dick, said to
be brothers, and enough alike in looks to make
the relationship seem reasonable. But Jack and
Harry never speak to one another. Jack issues his
orders in pidgin-English to Dick, who translates
them to aboriginal for Harry. And Harry will
not speak to me. He talks in abo. to Dick, who
translates into pidgin-English to Jack, who then
talks to me in very fair English. Yet Harry can
talk English pretty well, for he uses it with
other nigs. And if I speak to Harry, the same long
rigmarole is gone through. Jack is boss of the
three. It is no use my giving orders —if is Jack
who lays down the law. Also, he calls me “Mary
Jane” —or did, till I forced him to change it to
“Missus.” Dick calls me “Mamma,” to which I
conveniently turn a deaf ear. But the other day
Jack and Dick were out bush, working, when Harry
turned up with a message from the boss and
politely addressed me as “Grandma,” though he is
at least 20 years older than I.

Violet Blue Eyes.
By “PHLOX.”
u T WAS a wallflower again last night,
mother.”
“Most unfortunate, ruy dear, most
unfortunate. I can’t think who you take
after; certainly not after me. Anyway, w:
must try and many you off.”
“Suppose I don’t want to marry?”
“I’m not going to suppose anything of
the sort.”
“But if no man asks me?”
"Then, you’ve got to do your part, and
see that he does.”
“That I’ll never do.”
‘ Then you’d better go into a nunnery.”
“No, mother; that wouldn’t suit me. I’m
too. fond of the joys of the world.”
‘What about going to the Islands as a
missionary ?”
“And run the chance of being eaten?”
“Whatever you do in this world, my dear,
you have to take your chance.”
Anyway, mine’s not going to be in the
Cannibal Islands.”
‘By the way, Millicent, what are you
wearing for the dance on Tuesday?”
“I’m not going to the dance.”
“Not going! Why?”
“I overheard that horrid Talbot girl say
to Bessie Myers that my skin was blotchy,
and my hair like rats’ tails.”
“How very rude of. her.”
“Rude! I call it beastly. Anyway, I
have a grain of comfort. Jack Summers
says that I have lovely violet-blue eyes.”
“Of course you have.”
Instead of going to the dance Millicent
had Jones drive her to the home of Mrs.
Douglas—a friend of whom she was very
fond.
“I’m delighted to see you, dear,” was Mrs.
Douglas’s greeting; “but I understood you
to say that you were going to a dance to-
night.”
“I was, but—er—well, I’m tired of being
a wallflower.”
“I’m sorry, dear. Did you enjoy that
book I lent you?”
‘I did, indeed; especially where Trine
says that you can usually be what you make
up your mind to be. Now, I want to be
beautiful. Do you think if I desire beauty
long enough, and earnestly enough, it will
ever come to me?”
“It will, dear, if, as well as desiring, you
take practical means of assisting nature.”
“I would love to. I wonder if you would
be hind enough to advise me?”
“In the first place you need a good cream
that will nourish, and at the same time
remove the discoloration from your skin.”
“I did use a cream, and that horrid hair
you see on my face is the result.”
“So many creams do grow hair on the
face; but have you ever tried mercolized
wax?”
No; I’ve heard of it. I thought, how-
ever, that it, too, might favor the growth
of hairs.”
Not at all, dear. I’ve used it for quite
a long time. You’ve heard of Frenchwomen
going into retirement during Lent, and hav-
ing the skin of their faces and necks re-
moved by a painful process.”
“Yes; I’ve read about it.”
“Well, mercolized wax has the came effect
without causing any pain or inconvenience.
At night, before retiring, you simply wash
your face in warm water, using a good
soap—l always use Pilenta Soap—then
apply the wax to your face and neck,
it off in the morning, and before
powdering rub in a little of the mercolized
wax,. which is obtainable from most good
chemists. Instead of ordinary powder I
always use cleminite, which gives that soft
velvety bloom to the complexion.
‘ For those blackheads on your nose and
chin, stymol tablets are the best cure. Drop
a tablet in a tumbler of hot water, and when
the fizzing has subsided bathe the face with
the liquid. After drying you will find that
the blackheads have come out on the towel.
“For the hairs on your face there’s
nothing better than powdered pheminol,
which removes the hairs without disfiguring
the skin.”
“How very fortunate I met you. Mrs.
Douglas.”
“Now, for your hair. The first tiling to
e ll <^? ne * s shampoo it with stallax!”
“Yes, I’ve written that down. But I don’t
suppose you know of anything that will
keep my hair in curl?”
“Yes, I do —something, in fact, that will
make it curl.”
“How marvellous!”
“It s a perfectly simple preparation, called
silmerine, which you can get r.t the chemist’s
and you apply on retiring at night. Brush
jour hair out in the morning, when it will
be beautifully wavy, and any short pieces
curly.”
“Oh, how lovely that will be! You can’t
think what a load you’ve taken off my mind.
Aow if you would only prescribe something
for my red hands.. I’m so ashamed of them.”
I can, dear, give you a prescription that
tve tried myself with the best results. Add
oicrolium jelly to your list of wants from
the chemist. This pleasant, non-greasy sub-
stance quickly blanches the hands, removes
tan, clears out the dirt which soap cannot
reach, and makes the skin soft, white and
smooth.”
“How clever of you, Mrs. Douglas, to
know all. these things.”
“lAe just found them out by degrees.”
Oh, there s Jones for me. Good-night,
Mrs. Douglas: I don’t know how to thank
you.”
“Don’t, dear; but consistently use what
I have told you. When you have improved
jour skin and hair you will be quite beauti-
ful, and should make manv conqcusts with
those pretty violet-blue eyes.”

Corsets Specially Designed For YOU
GOSSARD Corsets are not designed like
other corsets. Gossard artists have
thought of you as belonging to one of the
nine ideal figure groups into which they
have divided all women. Special models
have been created for your particular fig-
ure needs—differently proportioned cor-
sets, differently boned corsets that will give
you just the support you need at your age
andyour weight to comfortably coax you
to the ideal proportions of your type.
A Gossard Corset designed for your very
own self is going to feel more comfortable
than you thought a corset could. It’s going
to meet you everywhere, with a steady,
uniform muscular support, but it isn’t
going to constrict or pinch you anywhere.
The whole idea of Gossard Type Cor-
setry is to bring you to graceful propor-
tions, one curve growing out of another
with no part unduly emphasized. When
this is done you will have an appearance
of slimness that the woman with a four-inch
smaller waist and your own hip measure-
ments can never have. A faithful follow-
ing of this simple rule will alone take
pounds and pounds away from a woman's
apparent silhouette and years away from
her apparetit age.
Be honest with yourself: —are you com-
pletely satisfied with both the appearance
and comfort of the corset you are now
wearing? Or does it cut into your limbs, or
pushup the bust when you are seated, or
cause an awkward, unbecoming bulge of
flesh under the shoulder blades and under
the arms, or do any of those many irritat-
ing things that the wrong corset can do to
hurt you and tire you out and make you
look years older than you really are?
When you can purchase a gentlewoman’s
corset for as little cost as the ordinary kind,
an exactly-right Gossard will make the

most of your natural beauty, will protect
your health, will be comfortable every
minute you have it on, will wash beau-
tifully and outwear two or even three ord-
inary corsets?
Go to the Best Store You Know
The stores selling Gossard Corsets take
pride in their service. You will be fitted by
an expert corsetiere who knows figure types
as well as corsets and who will assume full
responsibility for your satisfaction.
Gossard Brassieres
Gossard Brassieres, like Gossard Cor-
sets, are designed for the needs of the
nine figure groups. The new Longerlyne
models are priceless to the woman who
heretofore has been unable to find bras-
sieres with special shaping to support and
flatten the diaphragm apd with extra
length to prevent them from slipping up
over the lower tops of the modern corsets.
Yet they ate most reasonably priced
within the reach of every purse.

If you have the slightest doubt about your
type of figure, write to Miss Eleanor Gray,
the Gossard Corset Specialist, whose
years of experience are at your service.

Miss Gray has just completed a new

Harry Lauder is back in Sydney with some
new songs and a few additions to his unique
collection of wheezes, ancient and modern.
His pleasant voice has lost some of the
power which distinguished it m the days
when he used to sing “Rocked in the Lradle
of the Deep” with the best of them, but
considering all the work it has had to do it
wears amazingly well. It triumphantly re-
sponds to the test —a severe one —of a plain-
tive little unaccompanied ditty, and this
after 90 minutes’ hard going. With the ex-
ception of a dreadfully commonplace thing
called “Bella, the Belle o’ Dunoon,” the new
stuff is all good. The most popular is, per-
haps, “Doughie,” in which the wrongs of a
Scotch baker, unjustly suspected of an im-
proper regard for the lady next door, who
is “as straight as a die, an’ I can prove it
tae ye,” are comically intoned. But there is
homely feeling as well as humor in “There
is Somebody Waiting for Me,” an entirely
successful bluejacket study ; and “Singin’ is
the Thing” has a chorus which has already
caught on. Nor is Sydney tired of the old
favorites. On the contrary, it stoically sub-
mits to being bombarded with unctuous
platitudes (a habit that has grown on
Lauder since he became Sir ’Arry) in the
hope that, when the speaker lias got rid of
all the snuffle, he may be beguiled into sing-
ing "I Love a Lassie,” or “Roamin’ in the
Gloamin’,” or “Tobermory” or “Queen
amang the Heather.” Lauder furnishes half
•the programme at the Palace. The other
half is average vaudeville, Payne and Hil-
liard, dancers and mimics,, rather above the
average.
Australia’s premier character-comedy, “On
Our Selection,” raised its tousled head again
at: the Sydney Grand Opera House on Satur-
day night. Dad’s toothache is as unbearable
as of yore, and there is no waning in Sarah s
affection for Billy Bearup. The kangaroo
continues to lie defunct in the well, and
there is still only one scone left tor the
minister. As a matter of fact, the only
noticeable difference is that Dad has a
brand-new leather belt and bowyangs and
that with not the price of a bag of flour in
the house! The melodramatic interlude is
the only jarring note. It was introduced to
give the show a semblance of continuity, and
has continued ever since to be an underdone
suet-pudding in the moist of a good meal.

••Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife,” a comedy by
Alfred Savoir, that we are to see and hear
in plain English by an English professional
company in June. The Alliance Frangaise
through the agency of Belgian Consul
Sefriert, prepared, as one intellectual young
thlUg in the audience said, “this mental pick-
me-up after a frivolous day.” It certainly
gave students of the French tongue a good
three hours’ test. Mr. Segaert was not so
happy as an American millionaire with a
penchant for acquiring and divorcing wives
as he has been in previous plays. He has
too much Latin fire for the impersonation of
so light and self-indulgent a character as
Brown, and, as he warmed up to his job, he
acted as eloquently with his hands as he did
with his voice, in a manner utterly foreign
to John Browns. His youthful daughter
llenriette was ill-placed, too, as the sophis-
ticated, designing eighth wife, and she might
well be pardoned for giggling behind the
cover of her “History of Joseph” when she
invited her pretended lover to undress and
go to bed. Still, the situation gave the
audience a treat in the vision of Max Bru-
ning’s (Hubert’s) elegant waist. Ihe
pyjamas she handed him were as gaily
covered with roses as a November pergola,
and should have shocked Hubert into imme-
diate sobrietv. He had been a dull cavalier
up to the moment when Monna plied him
with champagne—the real thing, too; tlieq
he became really funny. Mrs. T. H. Kelly;
as the eighth wife that should have been,
brought the professional touch; but her
appearance was too brief and her lines too
few.

“If Winter Comes,” at Sydney Royal (and
elsewhere), is still testing whether a best-
seller can be made into an equally profitable
play. There are some who find Mark Sabre
tedious in the novel, and more so in the
acting version. But London liked him in
both vehicles; and what London likes mil-
lions more will at least pretend to.

Diggers are finding plenty to interest them
in “French Leave,” the war comedy at Syd-
ney Criterion, They laugh consumedly at
John Fernside, who is employed by a soli-
citous War Office to boil the General’s eggs,
and at Edwin Brett, the boot-clicking cor-
poral, whose duties are to see that he boils
them properly. The culinary scenes in
“French Leave” are a satire on the policy
(which wasn’t abandoned till April, 1918,
and not altogether then) of keeping hordes
of able-bodied soldiers engaged in such foot-
ling occupations as boiling eggs and making
beds for staff johnnies. Brett and Fern-
side enter into the spirit of the joke, and
manage to secure exactly the right effect.
It has been remarked that Emelie Polmi’s
manner of speaking broken English is much
the same in “French Leave” and “Madame
Butterfly.” “Madame,” by the way, appeals
more to the flaps, than the Japs. The lat-
ter’s amusements are mostly tennis and
punting.
Sydney Tivoli’s Easter Week programme
includes the Royal Southern Singers who
present, unaccompanied, a medley of coon
melodies, and reap a 20-bushel harvest of
laughs for their faithful imitation of a feline
concert. Oswald Bemand has arrived with
his educated pigeons, but, though he gets
some pretty effects, his patter is better* than
his poultry. La Ventura still catches the
eye with dazzling color, and the Glee Girls,
a dainty trio, offer an uncommon turn. Gus
McNaughton and Jesse Sweet have reached
a rather wearying interlude, “Professional
Jealousy,” and the Eight Arabs, Albert Rees
and the Gladiators continue to earn a place
on a generous bill.

Such is the call for love in plain-faced,
badly-dressed “Minnie,” at Sydney Lyceum
this week, that she has to write gushing
epistles to herself. To further impress the
neighborhood with her prowess as a vamp,
she claims a Chinese corpse lying in the
local morgue as a victim of her fatal fascina-
tion. If it wasn’t for a soft-headed cub
reporter clasping her to his bosoni, the mad
little maiden would have probably ransacked
the graveyard before the fade-out. "Ihe
Crossroads of New York,” also running
through this house, is a Mack Sennett six-
reel comedy-drama with much froth to its
beer. “Broadway Rose” enters on a long
season at the Globe, and of course there’s
a millionaire’s son waiting at the stage en-
trance with an offer of marriage. “The Cow-
boy and the Lady” supplies the Strand with
another cowpunching epic; and “One Wild
Week” is threatened with apoplexy in its
struggle to live up to its title. “The Sports-
man’s Wife” has its queue of admirers at the
Rialto, the Piccadilly offers “Monte Cristo,”
and Mary Pickford is booming in “Tess of
the Storm Country” at the Crystal Palace.

If not a nightmare, “Bulldog Drum-
mond,” which opened the newly-renovated
Melbourne Palace on Saturday night, has
had some nightmares thrust upon it. One
of these appears in the guise of a Dr.
Nikola-like spectre, who runs a combined
dope and blackmail factory for despoiling
builionaires of their ready cash. He is
assisted by a Yankee crook and a low-grade
vamp with unhinged eyeballs, and the trio
show a readiness to make every scene a
shriek in their attempts to prevent Bull-
dog bringing their plans to naught. A
casual advt. hurls Drummond into the
plot, and he is thereupon involved in several
garish situations in which he is straight-
jacketed and half-murdered, while his best
girl is chloroformed and tortured, and his
pal is laid low’ with a drugged cigarette. A
mysteriously-controlled door, a hypodermic
svringe. assorted weapons, a gibbering
Chinaman, the eternal telephone, and
numerous howls and noises are other
features of a disturbance wdiose imbecility
reaches a point unapproached by ‘‘The Face
at the Window.” Indeed, “‘The Face” by
comparison is lifted almost to the plane of
“THE PROMPTERS” AT SYDNEY
TIVOLI.
Jesse Sweet remonstrates with Gus Mc-
Naughton for his too enthusiastic use
of “effects” in their sketch.
Repertory drama. The foolishness of the
whole business is intensified by an occa-
sional adroitness of construction, visible in
the spoof of the crook’s apparent capture by
his own unholy following pretending to be
a posse from Scotland Yard ; but even sur-
prise at the audacity of the performance
pales before the wonderment of beholding
a 24-carat actor like G. H. ivlulcaster in a
shoddy Penny Dreadful setting.
* * * *
Mulcaster is excellent. Though a bulldog
in attack, his expedition in criminal research
is more suggestive of the bloodhound. He
is most noticeable for his nonchalance and
easy, graceful bearing, and his _ kindly, in-
veigling manliness makes even his grotesque
heroism bearable. Douglas Calderwood
and Leyland Hodgson are competent lieu-
tenants to the leading man, though Calder-
wood’s amiable sanity and Hodgson’s sunny
scepticism in the first scene seem impos-
sible to maintain in the light of after events.
George Bellamy is the dreadful Doctor who
misuses the Pharmacopseia for wicked ends.
Charles Road Night’s best acting tends to
concentrate in his trigger finger; and in his
silky tenor tones, which are often stealthy
with menace, there is an odd hint here and
there of a small Yiddish shopkeeper clinch-
ing a bargain. It may be due to Sylvia
Shaw’s strange hairdressing, lurid evening
gown, and deathly make-up that she looks
like a chronique scandaleuse panting for
publication. She has a smooth, pleasant
voice, but she does her best work in the
dressing-room. Eve Gray is a golden-
headed novice in the drama, but nervousness
possibly accounted for her pallid impression
of a distressed heroine on Saturday night.
Of the minor roles, Grafton Williams is a
forbidding doorkeeper for the crooks; Lou
Vernon totters briefly as a doped financier;
Thomas Sidney buttles in a perfect, old-
world manner; and Frank Dunn presents a
twitching forger who suicides mercifully
before he has time to turn his thirst for
whisky into a parlor game. The scenery
is mostly confined to unattractive interiors,
except in the case of Captain Drummond’s
sitting-room at Goring, where the stage fur-
nishers have something to say.
Despite the fact that it has a heartrending
kid interest and throws the spotlight on an
illicit divorce, “Woman to Woman” doesn’t
overcrowd Melbourne Royal. Nor, appa-
rently, is Gertrude Elliott capable of fanning
public curiosity to a bright flame. Yet she
has many good points. She is restrained in
her emotionalism, and her Frenchified man-
ner is much less theatrical than might be
expected. Likewise she has the_ rapt look
of a romantic girl who cherishes fond reco -
lections of a casual experience, however turn
it may appear to the partner of the scandal.
Where she errs, if anywhere, is in sweetening
the displays of sentiment, and in suffering
neglect and contumely with such holy resig-
nation that the admittedly selfish lover and
his wife seem almost inhuman by compari-
son. It is probably more a defect of person-
ality than of acting that she doesn t show
her claws under extreme provocation, in
the big scene of the second act, for instance,
there are sound dramatic reasons loi a
stronger sprinkle of vinegar in her now ot
milk and honey.
** * *
Nellie Bramley is now rescuing Howard
Jefferies, jun., from the clutch-of 1 elite
Captain Clinton in “The Third Degree at
Melbourne Playhouse. This part suits the
young actress better than any of her pre-
vious roles, and George Hewlett shows some
improvement, if no loss of vocal tonnage, as
the blithered youth who is_ subsequently tor-
tured into a confession of murder. V ictor
Pitzherbert is macadamised in all essential
aspects for the job of Clinton, and, in fact,
would prove an admirable M.C. for the
Crutchy Push’s annual picnic. Guy Hast-
ings, as the super-lawyer, Richard Brewster,
casts off his feather-bed style to wrestle wi n
the cop, whereas Arthur Cornell , early
scuttles his part of the elder Jeffenes by
mixing too much splutter with his indigna-
tion. As the suicide, Robert Underwood,
Leslie Woods does his best. off-stage with a
fearsome, heavy thud following the mild pop
of a ladylike revolver.
The only noticeable change in “A Southern
Maid” at Melbourne Majesty’s is that the
second in command of the vendetta party
has now modified the Wilson Barrett ex-
posure of his chest. For this concession the
audience is immensely grateful, and can now
turn its attention to other trifles.

“C.”: Bernard Shaw was the only dra-
matic critic of the first rank who doubted the
genius of Bernhardt. He had the unique
experience of having seen her and her great
rival, Duse, in the same piece, “Magda,” in
London in 1893, and his comparison between
the two is one of the most penetrating bits
of criticism he ever wrote. The plainness
of Duse, who played without make-up, with-
out artificiality, or any recognisable stage
gesture, set a standard of achievement which
the Frenchwoman, with all her greasepaint,
spotlights and adroitly-contrived entrances
and exits, failed, in his estimation, to reach.
What was marvellous to Shaw was that
Duse had such a fund of natural emotion.
He has put it on record that he actually saw
her blush, when, as Magda, she unexpectedly
met her old protector again. But it has to
be said for Sarah that she was 48 when
Shaw saw her, whereas Duse was 34.

Aubrey Mather as
the doctor.
think it is “over
30 years since he
came here with
Laura Yilliers,”
as “Norbell” (B.
15/3/’23) asserts.
From 1894 to 1897
Knight was at the
Lyceum with
Henry Irving, and
unless my memory
has failed com-
pletely, it was
after that he came
to Australia —not
to stay very long
on that occasion.
At the Lyceum
Knight figured in
one or two of
Tennyson’s thin-
blooded tragedies,
which failed so
miserably on the
stage. I question
if the combination
o f Tennysonian
stodge and Irving-
esque staginess did
the plastic young
man any good.
However, I am his
debtor for many
entertaining and
perfectly innocu-
ous hours. H e
never exactly thrilled me, but he was never
slipshod or tedious.
“Snowdrop” : Oscar Wilde had one of his
bitterest experiences with Bernhardt. Hard-
up in Paris, with nothing to live on but his
genius, he wrote the little play of “Salome”
for her, and invited his friends, Stuart
Merrill and queer Marcel Sehwob, to revise
the French of the script. Sarah, interested
in the play through a mutual friend, pro-
mised to read it, and cordially received the
author, who characteristically borrowed on
the prospective royalties, considering that
his work was as good as staged. Though the'
actress was professedly enchanted with the
piece, she dallied and dallied until Wilde
was sick with disappointment: and thefi
the MSS. came back with a polite note of
refusal. But “Salome” has the
actress. Translated into almost every Euro-
pean language, it is constantly being revived
on the Continent. It was also the inspira-
tion of Richard Strauss’s opera on the same;
theme.
“Second Murderer’s” reminiscence :
When Sarah Bernhardt came to Sydney in ’9l,
George Kignold gave up Her Majesty’s to her, and
himself shifted to the Royal pro , te.rn. Sarah and
eo. were late in arriving, and it was a rush to get,
the stage set. Besides, the stage-director hadn't
much English, and H.M. stagehands knew no French.
’■‘lei, id, ici; ’ere, ’ere, ’ere!” screamed the s.piP
•■Righto,” said Rock Phillips and his gang, as they
juggled with the furniture and brie-fl-brac. “’Cir-
nom!” yelled the s.m., hysterically. “Non, non, non !'
At last Rock lost his temper and ripped out some
thing vigorous. “Ah!” exclaimed the s.m. You saw
eetf Eh, bien! I tell Madame 1” And off he went.
Presently Rock was summoned into the pre-
sence, while the s.m. remained outside the
star’s dressing-room. Madame beamed at the
culprit, and, waving her hand round the
room, which had been beautifully decorated and
furnished in her honor, she inquired: “Voas? You-
do ’eem ?” Rock admitted it. “Ah, vous etes ,
tres amiable. An’ you swear terrible, too, is it not?”
She gave Rock her photograph,, a glass of wine, and a
Bernhardt smile. When he bowed himself out, the
s.m. remarked triumphantly, “Ha, ha! I tell
Madame, voilal” quite satisfied that Rock had been
sharply reprimanded. Sarah had more tact than
her stage director.
“Norbell”: The death (at 95) of Mrs.
Kelly, mother of Ned and Dan, the bush-
rangers, recalls Dan Barry’s grand mistake.
Dan had perpetrated “The Kelly Gang” at
the old Alec, Melbourne, and had a wonder-
ful spin with it, so he decided to take it up
through the Kelly country. At Mansfield,
he told me, the house nearly lynched him,
and he got frozen out all along the line.
Playgoers in those parts looked on him as
a profaner of holy things, and it took him
years to win back his good name. His out-
break richly deserved derision, being a far-
rago of imbecilities, with policemen con-
stantly turning into outlaws, and a very em-
bonpointy lady personating Dan Kelly.
Barry himself, as Ned Kelly, rushed on in-
termittently, blazed away with his revolver
and yelled “To the bush, boys!” He told
me that at one town he was his own bell-
man, and that night a disgusted bobbite de-
manded his money back. “That swine’s not
Ned Kelly,” he snorted —“that’s the old
blanker who was ringing the bell!”
A note from G. L. Goodman: —
“Nota B,” (B. 8/3/’23) states that the late J.
0. Williamson left me an annuity of £5OO. It was
a legacy, not an annuity, I am sorry to say.
“G.A.C.”: “The Mug” (B. 22/3/’23) is
right about Coyne, at least. Here was a
man w T ith a first-class London reputation,
and (as far as it was possible in the dis-
tressing circumstances) he justified it. But
his shows were ruined, for me at any rate,
by amateurish actresses, one of whom should
never have been tempted from the ice-cream
parlor. They made Coyne’s farces seem
crude and creaky. Farce is one of the most
delicate things of all to play. It calls
for grace, wit, individuality—in short, per-
fect acting. And it was impossible for
Coyne to supply that for all his company.
“Minuetto”: The gentle Moiseiwitsch is
accused of unexpected repartee in the latest
anecdote from America. The usual mob of
reporters hunted him out on his arrival at
New Yoik, and one of them, a raw hand,
wanted to know how he dealt with sundry
composers. “Now. how do you play Chopin,
Mr. Moiseiwitsch?” he asked, and there was
a scoffing look in his eye when the pianist
answered: “With the soul.” Thinking to
guy the Russian the reporter shot at him :
“Would you please tell me, then, how you
play jazz?” “With the body,” came the
reply—“feel preferred !”
On a deathless burlesque:—
“The Beggar’s Opera” was originally a burlesque
of Handel’s Italian operas. In 1728 that dogged
composer was struggling against odds that would have
overwhelmed an ordinary man. London society had
deserted him for the Italian Bupnoncini. Fashion-
able ladies gave balls on his opera nights, and
noble lords did not scorn to bring claques to hiss
his music at the theatre. “The Beggar’s Opera”
nearly proved the last straw. Some of the music
was taken almost direct from Handel’s operas, and
his style was guyed unmercifully. A less resolute
man would have given up the struggle; but Handel
went on producing operas at a speed which staggers
the less prolific composers of to-day. Nearly 10
years later he went bankrupt, and had a stroke of
paralysis. But his day was to come: in 1742 he
produced “The Messiah.” The modern reaction
against the indiscriminate Victorian worship of
Handel has not affected his position among the im-
mortals of music. His rival Buononcini, whom
London hailed as the superior genius, survives only
in a few gracefully formal songs. And now the
satirist arises after the lapse of nearly two centuries
and captivates London afresh, as he did in the days
when Italian opera was young. If Gay could
cee this, perhaps he would quote the bitter rhyme
jhe wrote to be his own epitaph:—
Life is a jest, and all things show it;
I thought so once, and now 1 know it.
“D.R.S.” : Scene, a third-rate cafe in the
land of the fried nigger. A sozzled ruffian
leaning against a counter watches a monkey
absorbing beer through a straw. When the
pot is half-empty the sozzled one grabs a
snickersnee and punctures the ape in his
misty mid-region, from which an amber
stream gushes forth. This he catches in a
glass and drinks. Then in an ecstasy of play-
THE UPLIFT.
“I was quite carried away from myself by that play."
“And yet they say the drama hasn’t a moral influence!"
fulness he bites four or five inches off the
brute’s tail. No question about the movies
having a refining effect on the young.
“Te Pana” : James Sullivan, who “directed”
the Kellerman pitcher recently completed
in M.L., imported a diving bell for the
cinematographer to work in while Annette
did her mermaid act. A reservoir was built
at Nelson, but the water was so discolored
that it was found impossible to make a decent
negative. Going to Christchurch Sullivan
discovered that he could get all the under-
water stuff he wanted in the tepid baths.
A pane of glass let into the wall was the
only addition needed, and the resultant
film was perfect. The bell and the Nelson
reservoir cost some thousand; the Christ-
church makeshift a few pounds only. Sul-
livan’s language nearly scorched the cellu-
loid.
“T.W.”: Italy’s composing and singing
crowd, headed by “Cavalleria” Mascagni, has
set up a howl because it has declined in favor
in other countries, and it is pressing the
Fascisti Government to get busy about re-
storing foreign affection. Mascagni went
to South America lately, and his boom was
so infinitesimal that only two performances
of his chief opera'were given. He found that
Russians, French and Germans were doing
most of the singing in places where Italians
used to amass fortunes. One of the worst
grumbles is about Covent Garden, over which
Italy always imagined it had a pre-emptive
right. But, of course, the Garden has closed
itself against all-comers, and not merely
the Carusos and Sammarcos.
“T.W.”: Just passed out of the Smoke,
James Fawn, a music-hall comedian of the
’Arry Rickards brand, whose most famous
ditty was “If You Want to Know' the Time,
Ask a P’leeceman,” closely followed by “It
Must Have Been the Lobster” and the saucy
“His Lordship Winked at the Counsel.”
Fawn’s was a juicy kind of humor, and by
contrast with the dry wit of Arthur Roberts
was very effective in Drury-lane panto.
He left the broader kind of salacity that
Cockneydom loves to the never-backward
Arthur, who is still on deck.
“Thor”: Amurrica has discovered that
Melbourne has a flapper Pavlova. The De-
troit Free Press gives a picture of an epi-
sode “during the recent entertainment given
by the Ladies’ College of Melbourne, Aus-
tralia, when Miss At-line Fitzgerald, called
the Pavlova of Australia, gave an exhibition
of her dance on a small ball pedestal.” Has
anyone really been telling one of Melbourne’s
college girls'that she is Pavlova II.?
“Jacky Roo” (London) : The cheeriest
show in London is provided by “The Co-
optimists,” who give what the programme
calls “a pierrotic entertainment.” Two years
ago Phyllis Moiikman (who dances like
Madge Elliott), Dave Burnaby, Laddie Clift
and others started the enterprise with £5OO.
They are their own composers, librettists and
producers, and, according to green-room gos-
sip, the thing has proved a great financial
success. Certainly the Co-ops. draw packed
houses, and hours of thbir fun is a
tonic. Their lead might well be followed
by a few clever people in Australia.
best comedy (or farce) is “Advertising
April,” in which the wiles of the modern pub-
licity-agent are brilliantly burlesqued by two
new writers. Herbert Far jeon and Horace
Horsnail. Sybil Thorndike is the leading
woman, and the newspapers arc unanimous
in her (and its) praise. It will be a crime
if the Firm or the Ward-Fullers don t secure
“Advertising April” for Australia. But
they will have to bid high.
“Flv-flat”: “E.” rather overdoes it in say-
ing (B. 15/3/’23) that “Australia swapped
O. I\ Heggie for an imported star.’ hen
Heggie left his native Adelaide
he was merely an interesting
novice, who had shown promise
as the Martian in “A Message”
from that planet. A tour with
Ellen Terry, not then in the
sere and yellow, was a great
artistic help to him. and then
lie had the good luck to become
associated with Bernard Shaw,
who developed a liking for the
young man and took pains with
him. Heggie has been in the
U.S. since 1914. Another re-
presentative American actor
from these parts is Cyril Keblit-
ley, who also got his first attack
of stage fever at Adelaide, where
he was a lawyer’s clerk. If
there hadn’t been stuff in
Keightley his early stage ex-
periences would have sent him
back to his solicitor’s office, lie
started with Dan Barry. Aus-
tralia hasn’t seen Cyril since
1902, or Ileggie since 1906. A
visit from either would be wel-
come.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: George
Harmston, circus proprietor,
expert horseman and good sport,
has died in England, aged 60.
He was in Australia twice, the
first time in 1890. Harmston
spent his boyhood in India, and
developed a trick of training
wild animals; and three elephants, which lie
captured as babies and trained, gave him a
start in the show business. He left the
circus when the war hurt it, and turned to
the movies.
“G.A.0.”: Let me toll “G.” (B. 22/3/’23)
that Brisbane leads the rest of Australia in
letting blokes smoke at the theatre. And
not only at Cremorne or at the Empire,
where vaudeville and light musical stuff are
supplied. When Miriam has hysterics in
“Outcast,” at the new Royal, you can study
the paroxysms through the blue mist of a
Corona-Corona. Even hysterics are bear-
able in such circumstances. But, then,
Brisbane knows how to make playgoers com-
fortable. The theatres are so arranged as
to admit any stray river-breeze that may be
hovering about. Result—-well-filled houses,
even on the sultriest evenings.
“V.C.”: In addition to his £6OO-a-week
contracts (B. 15/3/’2.3), George Robey holds
a life engagement at £lOO p.a. as Court
Jester. Tne once picturesque and perilous
job has degenerated into a sinecure, but the
pay, though small, is regular, being a charge
On the Privy Purse. The bushy eyebrows
are entitled to be present at Court functions,
but the appearance of Cap and Bells would
cause a sensation.
“THE O'BRIEN GIRL ,” AT MEL-
BOURNE PRINCESS'S.
One of the jim-jam dances, characteristic
of the show.
“Nella”: “Peter’s” mention of Ada Fer-
rar and “The Sign of the Cross” (B.
l/3/’2i>) recalls a capable company, but I
think it was in “Prisoner of Zenda” they
opened first at the Melbourne Princess s.
Besides Ada Ferrar and Julius Knight, the
co. included Mary Elliott-Page, Edith Sut-
ton, Mrs. Maesmore Morris, Nellie Mortyne,
Gaston Mervale, Caleb Porter, Harry Hill,
Mario and George Majeroni, Dick Stew-
art, William F. Hawtrey and James B.
Atholwood. Mervale, Atholwood and Nellie
Mortyne are, at the moment of writing,
playing together with Louis Bennison at
Sydney Boyal. It is more than 25 years
since they first stormed in “Sign of the
Cross.”
TOILETTE INTIME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Her frock, when she’d straightened and smoothed it,
She put on the back of a chair.
Then she manicured quite twenty minutes,
And spent half-an-hour on her hair.
After that (she’d no need of a corset),
A pinkish slip-bodice she doffed,
That was sleek as the wing of a swallow
And as down on a gosling was soft.
She stood now in a ravishing singlet,
And a petticoat frilled at the knee,
While a something, silk-stockinged, delicious,
Played merry old Harry with me!
Do you marvel, you fellows of fifty,
At the utter undoing of me?
Let us on. (Oh', you needn’t be startled:
• I’m very judicious and chaste.)
She unfastened S. gadget or something,
And the silk fell away from her waist.
Then she showed as a figure false-boyish,
Though she was not a boy the least bit,
And I said, “If she takes any more off
Mrs. Grundy will have a bad fit.
Should I tell her what sweets I have spied on —
Sure, to hurt the old thing would be mean!’*
So I stop about here, and I mention
The presence demure of the screen.
I was watching a cinema picture
That never a censor had seen.
// you say, “When she ceased to look boyish
I Cos she swish as we’d think she wauld be?”
You come flat up against a determined
And jealous old censor- — that’s Me!

TKe NEW EDISON
Due to favorable conditions, we can now
announce a considerable reduction in price
for all models of “The New Edison” —flawless
Re-Creator of every kind of music and product
of a master mind in the science of acoustics.
THOMAS A. EDISON, LIMITED, 364-372 Kent Street, Sydney.
What
Edison said
and what
he did.
“If music is worth anything—and in my opinion it
is worth much—then it is worth nothing less than
perfect recording and perfect reproduction.”
And, believing this, he spent £600,000 in his search
for that perfection. Now he has attained the end
he sought for, and offers you the result of his labor:
An instrument that Re-Creates every overtone and
sound color with absolute fidelity—as proved by
actual tests by direct comparison on public plat-
forms.
A diamond reproducer—so there are no needles to
change—or to cut the records—or to be worn out
before a selection is half-finished.
Motive power for the reproducer—nothing so un-
scientific as having the sound-groove move the
reproducer by friction.
Re-Creations that are thick enough to give the true
tone without local vibrations—that are so hard as
to be free from wear or breakage—that are so finely
engraved as to contain nearly twice as much music
per inch.
Ability to play all talking-machine records at their
very best, while no other machine will play Edison
Re-Creations without detriment.
By these, and other improvements, the world’s
greatest inventor offers you a perfect instrument
for your home, therefore you should not be satisfied
with anything less. Write to-day for Catalogues of
Edison Period Models and Edison Disc Re-Creations.

For many years now I have been
playing pianos in many theatres
in many parts of the‘world\ but
I can truly say that never have I
been more completely suited than
with the exquisite, little Beale Baby
Grand I am at present using at the
Tivoli. 3My wife — (3Miss Lee
White) —■* heartily endorses me in
this opinion. She, like myself, has
had an unusually extensive associ-
ation with good pianos and realises
to the full just how an excellent in-
strument can help inputting across
such a turn as that in which we speci-
alise. Our heartiest congratulations
on the production of an instrument
so worthy to rank with the very few
makes upon which one can absolute-
ly depend for tone, endurance and
unusually flexible dynamic effects.
CLAY SMITH
LEE WHITE
TELLING stories in a captivating, husky-toned, charm-
ingly-pitched voice; singing delightful songs in a delight-
ful way; laughing, talking—this, together with the musical
contributions by her husband, Clay Smith, is the Lee White
that Australian theatre-goers have learned to love.
In every part of the world these two charming entertainers
have delighted thousands—relying on nothing except the
absolute finish and refinement of their performance, Having
used pianos of practically every make, their letter alongside
is of exceptional interest.
Beale is sold on one . two or even three years' terms.

“Sidweelan”: Something new in the way
of resignations blew into the head office of one
of Sydney’s biggest island trading cos. by a
recent mail. Addressed to the general-
manager it ran as follows:
Sir, —-I beg to tender herewith my resignation from
the position of Overseer on your Compan.v’s Plant-
ation at , and trust to be relieved at the earliest
possible date, say next steamer. I cannot remain
here any longer under the present Manager. The
Blankard’s Mad.
“Caesars Ghost”: We have a dramatic
club which wanders over our very consider-
able suburban district and gives here and
there performances “lor deserving objects.”
There was recently trouble in the club ; and,
called to a show-down by its lay members,
the management committee, which seems to
have been mainly the man who acted as
secretary, stage manager and very often
leading actor, unapologetic-ally explained that
this Pooh-Bah had received £284 for "ex-
penses” during a period in which “hospitals
and donations” had reaped £57.
"B.”: On appearances the fruit industry
in Tasmania is booming at present. Ilobart
wharves are crowded with cases of apples
waiting to be loaded for London. This year
n° less than 1,402,000 cases will be exported.
Freight cost Os. per case last season; the
rates this year are from Is. 6d. to 2s. lower.
But there’s another side to the picture.
Ilie large accumulation of canned fruits,
jam and pulp at preseht held has deadened
the market, and growers will be left with
tons of soft stoned fruit. One big jam-
maker contracted to buy plums at 3s. per
bushel. He is now giving the growers Is. Od.
per bushel to cry off.
* * * #
-C.”: Next time ‘‘The Deacon” and
‘ Centre (B. 15/3/’23) are in a coun-
try township at night they ought to
go round to the bakehouse and watch
the local “doughy” at work. They
will have further opportunities of losing
money. For most country bakers can carve
amorphous dough into pieces of 21b. 3oz. with
absolute accuracy. (Town bakers use
machinery and lose the cunning of hand
and eye.) Similarly, hundreds of grocers
can put up 21b. bags of sugar correctly with-
out scales, and many a wood merchant can
bag up lewt. of wood to within a half-pound
or so, especially if there’s a bet on.
“Albutt”: It came like a gleam of sun-
light to lighten the dull routine of our
office. A parcel of perishables had been
unduly delayed in transit, but the consignee’s
claim for compensation was turned down,
and the 2s. 6d. forwarded to him was merely
to defray what he had spent in telegrams.
The reply, written in pencil, ran as follows:
Your kind letter offering- me 2s. 6d. when I
reckoned a couple of quid wasn’t enough for the
goods which went bad. Evidently you think it
didn’t go bad, but if some of you pot-bellied blokes
which sit in offices all day had to have smelt this
parcel when it arrived you would have looked that
sick the undertaker would have started to take your
measurements. The money you sent me I am getting
made into a medal, and will wear it on my watch-
chain to remind me of you stingy cows. If you ever
come out this way don’t forget to introduce yerself.
I’ll be looking forward to meeting vou.
* * * *
A lawyer’s view :
I can’t understand “Stellsby’s” apparent sym-
pathy (B. 22/2/’23) for the widower whose “own
property doesn’t revert to himself” when his wife
dies intestate. If he had given the house to her,
it wasn’t his own property. If he considers that
it still was, he stands convicted of having made a
gift that was no gift, with only one of two pos-
sible objects: (1) To dodge his lawful creditors; or
(2) to evade the death-duties, if he died before
her. And then her dying without a will proves
both of two things: (1) He was an unbusinesslike
person who didn’t see to it that his wife, now a
person of property, behaved as such; and (2) she
was quite satisfied with the kindly law which enacts
that tier children shall get two-thirds of what she
leaves, and her husband —even though the original
proprietor—only one-third. No, a man who makes
a gift with a string to it, and then loses hold of
the string, can’t claim sympathy on either moral
or legal grounds.
* * * *
“Bret Vane” : A scheme of “airless” stor-
age is being put before the man on the land
in Victoria. It somehow recalls the mum-
mifying process of the ancient Egyptians,
but it rests on the scientific fact that in a
vacuum all chemical action, such as decay,
is arrested, and it is claimed that foodstuffs
so stored lose none of their flavor. Given
an airtight container of some sort, all that
is required is a pump to exhaust it of all
air, and one has been designed, very small
and simplicity itself, which is operated by
hydraulic pressure obtained from a common
water tap. It is claimed that a setting of
eggs, so kept for 14 months, were afterwards
all hatched; but that’s nothing to the grain
that germinated after being kept for thou-
sands of years in an Egyptian tomb. How
did they do it?
* * * *
“Parama”: “Ivip” errs (B. 8/3/’23) when
he says that “if a real pearl is pared into
the smallest of pieces no core different from
the pure composition of the shell is ever
found.” Every pearl, no matter what its
form, has as a nucleus some foreign matter
which, setting up an irritation in the tender
tissues of the mollusc, stimulates the flow
of nacreous secretion which eventually covers
it. The composition of all pearls, whether
fresh or salt water, is the same, and is also
identical with the composition of the shell
in which they are found. The fact that not
only grains of sand, but tiny shells, and even
fish, have entered the shells of molluscs and
been caught there, covered with the nacreous
secretion, and are now on exhibition in Lon-
don and Paris, as well as the U.S.A., utterly
disproves “Kip’s” assertion that nothing can
enter into “that part of the shell in which
the pearl is usually found.” As for the re-
port that Japanese at Broome are inserting
glass beads, pearl culture was practised hun-
dreds of years ago in China —and is still
carried on extensively. A temple stands in
Chung-Kwan-o, the headquarters of the
pearl-culture industry, to the memory of Yu
Shun Yang, the 13th-century p ; oneer of this
branch of enterprise. The Japanese entry
into the business of pearl-culture is a very
modern affair, and though much boomed,
doesn’t look as though it would interfere
with the market, “not so’s you’d notice.”


All Australia Uses Rexona.
MISS FLORENCE ROBERTSON
(From a photo.)
“After having: been under medical treat-
ment for nearly 13 months for Eczema on
my head,, I gave Rexona a trial, and in
six weeks my head was cured.
“(Miss) FLORENCE ROBERTSON,
“Kaiapoi, Claremont Street, Campsie,
“N.S.W.”
Never a day passes but that Rexona scores another
triumph over those serious troubles of life—Sores, Bad
Legs, Piles, Eczema, Pimples, Blotches, Burns, Nasal
Catarrh and Rheumatism.
The dainty little triangular pot of Rexona, the Rapid
Healer, contains a combination of the most curative,
antiseptic, soothing and healing properties known to
science. Rexona is the Skin Remedy of the Age, because
it destroys the harmful germs that may be in
a sore, pimple or any abrasion of the skin, thus preventing
any contagion of the blood, and at the same time causes
a new, healthy skin to grow.
REXONA immediately reduces the inflammation and
pain; it acts as a distinct stimulant to the pores of the
skin, and sets up a healing action immediately that
increases day by day.
Bad leg sores that have resisted every other
treatment succumb almost immediately to the
wonderful influence of Rexona, while for Piles
there is nothing its equal.
Rexona, Best for Bad Legs,
Eczema, Piles and Ringworm.
You cannot afford to take chances with any of these serious troubles.
What you want is a really reliable remedy which is easily applied and
can be depended upon to heal quickly. Rexona fills this need. There
is no better treatment than to get a tin of Rexona and apply this
antiseptic healer night and morning. First wash the parts affected with
warm water and Rexona Medicated Soap, and then apply a little
Rexona, binding with a soft cloth when possible.
Rexona is a specially-prepared product, made especially to overcome
such serious troubles as these. Those who use Rexona will not be
disappointed, for Rexona heals quickly and absolutely.
Rexona Heals Rashes, Sores
and all Skin Eruptions.
Sometimes when you are at your wits* end and feel that your efforts
are a failure, a friend can make the right suggestion and pull you
through. Obstinate sores of long standing reduce some unfortunate
sufferers to despair.
Remedy after remedy fails, and it seems nothing will help.
But you cannot have tried Rexona, for Rexona is always reliable. All
sores should be cleansed once or twice a day with warm water and
Rexona Soap.
Rexona Medicated Soap destroys germs and encourages the skin to
healthy action. Then apply a dressing of Rexona, the Rapid Healer.
Inflammation will quickly subside, healthy new skin will form, and the
body begin to build up new flesh again. You have not given yourself
A fair chance you have tried Rexona Soap and Rexona Ointment.

One gentleman to another in the N.S.W.
Labor party:—
I have known men as cowardly in attack, some
as unscrupulous, a small number as mean, but very
few with such abundant impudence.
Robbie O’l lalloran, M.L.A. for Eastern
Suburbs, said it of the effusive McGirr.
A country matron has a counterblast to
the frequent assertion that by exposing her-
self the modern girl endangers her chances
of matrimony, .curiosity being the great mas-
culine appeal. With three daughters well
advanced in the twenties and showing no
sign of moving off, this lady descended upon
Sydney last December ; and the girls, who
had their first experience of the surf, became
devotees. Their fine country-built figures
attracted considerable attention ; and before
many months have passed the wedding-bells
are going to'ring for each of them. '
“Alkaloid”: “Stellsby” (B. 15/3/’23) need
not worry much. The question of bovine
tubercular infection has been the subiect of
rigorous investigation and test, and it is gen-
erally agreed that the cow is rarely, if ever,
seriously affected with the bacillus of human
tuberculosis. The possibility of humans being
infected with bovine tubercle has also been
severely tested. Pulmonary phthisis appears
to be almost exclusively due to the human
type .of the bacillus ; whereas extra-pulmonary
tuberculosis, particularly the glandular and
abdominal tubercle in children, is quite fre-
quently caused by the bovine type.
“Zimra”: The epicure’s dissertation (B.
8/3/’23) on the disappearance of culinary
arts with the adoption of the d la carte sys-
tem recalls an incident at a Ballarat (Vic.)
pub some years ago. A couple of commer-
cials, wearied of the perpetual round of
roasts, grills, fried, stewed and boiled meats,
demanded asparagus, squabs and peche
Melba. “But they’re not in the me-’n’-you,”
expostulated the waitress. The exasperated
bagmen sought the boss, but that autocrat
proved adamant. “Everything here is table
d'hote ,” he averred. “Your pardon,” cor-
rected one bagman—“the sanitary service is
d la carte.”
"-\: In Queensland, where the death
penalty has been abolished and a life sentence
is the maximum for the taking of life, the
opinion gains ground that murderers should
not be released except on the clear under-
standing that any future lapse into crime
•shall entail a reversion to the original (life)
sentence. In a recent Maryborough case
of stealing from a dwelling the dossier of the
thief revealed that he had been convicted of
murder in 1911, but after serving 10 years
had been let loose upon society. Since then
he had been twice convicted and sentenced.
The I'.M. regretted he could give him no
more than a “sixer” for the last addition to
his criminal record. How long will it be
before a ruffian of this type resorts to violence
again ?
One of, the hardest workers on behalf of
women died recently in England. Clemen-
tina Black was the daughter of the Town
Clerk of Brighton, and on his death took
her two sisters to London and had a hard
struggle to bring them up. She wrote many
books on the sweated trades long before the
days of the hysterical suffragette. In 1913,
when she was past work, she was given a
Civil List pension of £75 a year. A novel
she wrote around tlie dockers’ strike of
1889 is a good record of the beginning of
the new unionism. One of her sisters, Con-
stance, is married to Edward Garnett, son
of the head of the British Museum Library,
and has made translations of great Russian
novelists. A niece, whom Clemen tin a brought
up, is the daughter-in-law of H. W. Mass-
ingham, editor of The Nation.
A line from a returned Australian :—-
Any wartime canards as to Margot Asquith’s pro-
Germanism were, as inferred in The Bulletin
(15/2/’23), absurd. She always wants to be, like
Freddy Shipman’s travelling stars, “different.” The
two elder Asquiths, however —one killed in France,
The other gassed—were Margot’s stepsons. “Henry”
was a widower with two boys and a girl—the
latter is the clever Elizabeth who did such fine
hustings work to push papa in for Paisley—when
his present unusual lady first liked his looks.
Margot has one son (Anthony) and one daughter.
The girl married an unimportant-looking Roumanian
princeling, Bibeseo, formerly attached to his country’s
Embassy in London, and recently in the same kind
of billet in U.S.A. One of the notable men Margot
has an unshaken respect for is Australia’s Gilbert
Murray. The Oxford don and his wife often spend
part of the summer vacation at the Asquiths’ pretty
country place, The Wharf.
Duncan Fraser, lately retired after nearly
40 years’ service as a detective, told the Law
Reform Commission in S.A. what he thinks
of things in general:—
I know little about civil cases, but am in favor
of retaining trial by jury in all criminal cases. The
system has the confidence of the people. A majority
(of not less than nine) verdict should be accepted,
except in murder cases, where it ought to be unani-
mous. Juries are drawn from all walks of life and
frequently have a wider experience of the world
than the judge, and it is often valuable to him. A
great majority of criminals, especially if they have
been through the mill before, prefer trial by magis-
trate to facing a jury. There should be provision
for degrees of murder. Many juries which shrink
from doing so as the law now is would find a
verdict of guilty if there were. Has a client without
counsel much chance of winning his case? Oh,
yes; some of them do better than with. The judge
invariably watches their interests.
“Double S.” meets an old friend:—
An echo of my old droving days recently came to
me with a man I hadn’t seen for nearly 30 years.
When I met him first he was cook on a Bananaland
station, and “English aristocrat” was written all
over him, though of his own affairs he was silent.
A few years later I struck him humping bluey cn
the road to Towerhill. We camped together and
over the last quart-pot of tea and damper he told me
he had married a station governess who had turned
out a wrong ’un. He had cleared out and was then
trying to lose himself once more in the North. As
I parted from him I reckoned he was on the way to
the Devil. When he dug me up the other day I
learned that the war had made a re-adjustment in
the family in the Cold Land, and he had found him-
self wanted there. His wife, after a brief, lurid
life, had died, and he invited me to meet his young
bride at the hotel. “I hope to God it’s a boy,” he
had occasion to remark. To-day I hear that it is,
and one of the oldest names in England and Scotland
looks like being carried on. “Where do you think
I was when I got word?” he asked me. “Cooking
at C ,” I answered at random. “Yes. I made
back to the old place again. And I’m taking my
wife there before we go back. She won’t believe I
was ever a shearers’ cook.”

Make Peace with
Your Stomach.
YOU CANNOT FORCE your stomach to do work that
it is unable to do. It has been tried time and again, with
always the same result. The stomach is a good and faithful
servant, but, when pushed beyond the limit, it rebels. Some
stomachs will stand much more abuse than others, but every
stomach has its limit, and when that limit is reached it is a
very dangerous and unwise proceeding to attempt to force
it into doing further work.
THE REASONABLE COURSE and the most sensible is
to procure a substitute to carry on the work of digestion, and
give the stomach an opportunity to recuperate and regain its
lost strength.
DR. SHELDON’S DIGESTIVE TABULES digest what
you eat, and are the only perfect substitute to take up and
carry on the work of tired, worn-out stomachs. They are
natural and easy in their work, and cause no disturbance in
the digestive organs. They contain all of the essential
elements that make up the gastric juice and other digestive
fluids, and will digest any food that a strong, healthy stomach
will, and do it in the same time and in the same way. Dr.
Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules are sold in two size tins, 1/9
and 2/9.

Perchance.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
HERE it is very still, yet, blown afar,
The breezes’ thousand fifes of ivory
Make a thin music where, above
the sea,
Night wakens, star by star.
Dusk seems a thing discreet! With scarce
a sigh
The silver ripples dream along the sand.
Sleep-stilled, Life watches, from the pulse-
less land,
The tranquil twilight die.
And purple depths of darkness, like a flower’s
Deep lilac loveliness, bend dimly down
Above dusk sea and golden, fretted town
To shield sleep’s poppy hours.
Dim hills and soundless sea, pale sands,
hushed pines—
Too passionless night seems for pain!
Yet see
Where through the dark’s inviolate mys-
tery
The city’s flame-heart shines!
Like a sweet, perilous music in a dream
From some Calypso’s isle where sirens
sing,
With naught of grief in its gay chal-
lenging,
Those lights innumerous seem.
Yet pain, like blood, beats through its seeth-
ing life
That strives to weave some arabesque
sublime
Upon the moving tapestry of time
That stays not for its strife!
There laughter meaningless and futile tears
Mask the dull griefs of hearts at war with
fate,
And love, grown laughterless and desolate,
Muffles abysmal fears.
Malice, despair and all that thwarts and bars
Men’s dreams, the dregs of all that once
was fair,
And all life’s twisted ironies are there
Heneath the circling stars.
The dumb, wise stars, that keep the secret
well
Of all God whispers as they smile
brood,
Mocking the city in her solititude,
A wraith cast out from Hell!
Night’s star-white bowl brims with the
drowsy dark’s
Attar of slumber, drifting, poppy-sweet,
Whereon the changeful city swims, a fleet
Of dancing amber sparks.
And, changeful, too, the poignant, blind
regret
Thrills to wild music at the heart of me—
A rebel joy that moves to melody
Of hopes unvanquished yet;
Strong hopes that sense, beyond the grief
that seems
Some thought unfathomed, some divine
refrain,
Past all the bitter mockery of pain,
One deep, eternal dream.
The lonely lights fade past the rim of night;
Yet well my heart knows, in some far-off
sky
All fire and lilac shadow", Dawn trails by
Iler galleons of delight.
And all a new day’s hope and wonderment
Flames ’twixt blue seas and richer blue
above;
Calm as a woman’s tranquil eyes, whence
love
Laughs, and is well content.
And so I know, though here Pain’s might
hold sway,
Far off the morning lights of laughter
gleam;
And through the shining seaways like a
dream
Sail home the ships of day.

Puttrell’s Desertion.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE wonder of Puttrell’s desertion
lasted Port Darwin longer than
nine days. They talk of it still in
Palmerston without getting nearer the truth.
Liver, fever and the “same old thing” are
explanations that did not apply to Puttrell’s
case: for he was a small drinker and nor-
mally healthy and sane in mind and body ;
he was credited with a temperament rather
phlegmatic than sanguine, and if he took im-
pressions at all it w r as slowly, reluctantly, as
a stone takes the agelong pressure of a leaf,
retaining the image for all time. His patience
was monumental. Of an evening lie would
sit hour after hour writing steadily while
the mosquitoes fed on him: other men would
have been driven to bed, or to foregather,
for mutual protection, in a billiard-room.
Only once had he been known to succumb
to circumstances. He had been saving for
six years to go on leave, and three months
before his furlough fell due his company
went into liquidation. The new agreement
he was forced to sign was for five years,
and, obeying some definite impulse of his
well-regulated brain, he got drunk, and re-
mained so for a fortnight. At the end of
that time he returned to his normal state
with a renewed zest for economy and work.
This steadfast disposition of his, there-
fore, made the mystery of his collapse and
flight all the greater. He should have been
a very happy man—he was certainly a for-
tunate. Why, then, had he fled, as a leper
flees his fellowmen? In the club he was
tried and found guilty. Perhaps here and
there was a woman who did not turn her
thumb down ; but nobody dreamt of blaming
the poinciana.
I saw Puttrell and his wife last in Syd-
ney. They appeared quite to have outlived
the memory of his flight. I could not detect
a shade in the mind of either which might
have been construed into the vagueness of
an uneasy recollection or the shadow of
some lurking fear. Their sense of security
was mutual. They seemed supremely happy.
Before his marriage Puttrell lived in a
state of sheer wretchedness. His house was
overrun by cockatoos and monkeys, dogs
and cats. His Chinese cook victimised him,
and his “boy” systematically maintained
bis personal effects in a condition of chaos
from which there seemed no redemption.
Mrs. Puttrell altered all that. She hurg
pictures on his walls, art-muslin in his win-
dows ; she routed the army of birds and ani-
mals and the accumulation of rubbish un-
der his bed; and Puttrell began to appear
with buttons on his shirts and laces in his
boots. She drove the sensitive plant out of
his garden and planted Southern flowers in
its stead. But she left the great straggling
clumps of poinciaua that noted over his
verandah-roof. That season it had not
bloomed, but the mysterious glimmer of
its leaves lighted up the whole interior of
the house.
It was the year of the drought, when the
wet monsoon failed us, that Puttrell’s w T ife
came up from South to marry him. I re-
member his suppressed excitement, his boy-
ish alternations of delight and panic at the
prospect: I had not suspected him of so
much susceptibility. Darwin was a huddle
of grey roofs, of scorched, boughs, of
dusty, gaping earth. A few trees, still in
leaf, gleamed vivid green amongst these neu-
tral tints. The sky hung so low as to seem
within reach of the hand. Mrs. Puttrell
came like a breath of spring; she glowed
like some welcome Southern flower amidst
the dry bones of our landscape. Puttrell
went quite mad about her. She had a little,
uncontrollable laugh that mounted and
mounted like a bird. Puttrell sa'd it bubbled
like the rain we so badly needed. His joy
in her was so immense as to be near akin
to terror. He watched the Southern peaches
in her cheek with the jealousy of a mother;
he guarded them from the hot sun and the
dry wind from inland, and woke in the
mornings out of dreams of a marauding
moon, which made his heart beat loud with
fear. He found a childish pleasure in set-
ting her dainty fresh figure up against the
crude exotic backgrounds that the place pro-
vided —the livid grey skies, the pale seas,
the muddy-colored children and the degraded,
tumbledown vistas of Chinatown. All day
he would stand off, so to speak, and survey
the picture she presented, the contrast which
always served so well to emphasise her own
temperate charm and sober coloring.
Mrs. Puttrell’s verandah became a ren-
dezvous for all Darwin. We got into the
habit of strolling there in the evenings just
for the pleasure of watching her, of hearing
her laugh : if she were not present the evi-
dences of her fresh energy, her feminine touch
were all there. Old Braid, the harbor-
master, fat and lethargic, used to bring the
burden of three heavy meals and a day’s
liquor to her house, and sit blinking at her
with his tired, sun-blinded eyes, in a sort of
wondering incredulity. It was 20 years
since he had seen a woman like this: he
associated her vaguely with fairies and
nymphs and lines of poetry learnt in school-
days, that floated into his brain like memo-
ries of a former existence. She worked the
same temporary renovation in our tennis, in
all our lymphatic activities. She made us
gather round the piano and sing old songs,
instead of listening to new ones on the
gramophone.
Of course, the peaches faded. That was
inevitable ; but Puttrell had refused to recog-
nise it. He had deluded himself into a belief
in their immunity. Even when he saw them
blanching before his eyes he w T ould not
acknowledge the slow fact.
The drought broke memorably. The
first breath of the new monsoon came
creeping over the swamps, and south-
ward the snowy dome of a cloud
peeped up. Higher and higher it crept,
white and gleaming under the sun. It
reached to the zenith, and still its length
kept uncoiling below. Its base blackened,
faint lightning flickered across the sea, and
thunder muttered somewhere. Then, as if
its mighty foot had been undermined, it began
to bend and totter, its front darkened and
splayed out, and with a sudden rush of wind
that' swept whole dry flocks of leaves out of
the gum-trees, the great mass fell and the
sky was filled with its tumbling masonry,
shot through with lightning and crashing
thunderously. The earth stirred, as if feel-
ing the whip: the vegetation, like weals
springing up under the lash of the showers,
awoke to announce the advent of color.
The color was fatal to Puttrell’s pictures.
His backgrounds were all marred with bright-
ness ; and against them the new, unhealthy
pallor of his wife’s face started out like
some unearthly graveyard thing. The hint
of approaching dissolution was in it. It
smote his heart.
He accused himself of selfishness, of sheer
egoism. Nothing else had prompted him to
the transplanting of this frail southern
flower. He saw it wilted, plucked by the
wind, strewn dispetalled. He saw the
whole gradual process enacted before his eyes,
as in a moving picture—the brave cheerful-
ness crushed, the little winged laugh brought
fluttering down. He painted the hopeless
struggle, her pitiful subterfuges. He made
of her a new picture, a wan, white figure
merging into a background of dark hothouse
shades. He saw her approaching more and
more the type of the women he knew—weary,
vanquished. He conceived her existence as
a living death.
Mrs. Puttrell went about the house en-
tirely oblivious of the wild fancies her pale
cheeks had roused. She sang at her work,
too, occasionally ; but not so much as usual,
because she had much to do. Puttrell mis-
construed her busy silence. When she spoke
he seemed to hear the growing weariness in
her voice, and when she moved about he lis-
tened for the hint of it in her footsteps.
He seemed to be looking on at the last
struggles of a creature for -whose agonies his
hand was solely responsible. The tragedy
of her slow, silent blanch’ng was too terrible
to witness. It drove him out of her sight,
out of the house. Topee-less, his feet in
sandals, he took to wandering out, right in
the full ciash of noon, into the blazing
streets. The roads, as if they had been
running a lone race with the heat. trembPd
and panted under his feet. The white walls
and roofs shrieked at him. Rare figures,
clad in white, called to him out of a halo of

Every Picture
Tells a Story "
Home Again—with the
Same Old Backache!
Does every day bring the same old, nagging backache?
Do you rise in the morning lame and stiff? Drag
through the day with your back a dull, unceasing ache?
Evening find you “all played-out,” thinking only of a
little rest before to-morrow’s weary grind? Then don’t
be discouraged. Realise it’s merely a sign you haven’t
taken good care of yourself—been overworking and
haven’t had enough exercise, rest and sleep. This has
probably strained your kidneys. So, instead of worrying, just take things easier for awhile and
help the weakened kidneys with Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. Then, if it’s kidney backache,
you’ll soon get over it, and the headaches, dizziness, tired feelings and bladder troubles will go, too.
Doan’s have helped thousands and should help you. Ask your neighbor.
TWO INTERESTING CURES.
A MAN’S CASE.
Mr. Thomas Spence, Harriet Villa, Park Road, Auburn, says“ For years I
was an engine-driver on the N.S.W. Railways, and for a long time prior to my
retirement suffered greatly with my kidneys. I think the constant exposure had
the effect of weakening these organs. The first warning I had of anything being
wrong was a pain in the small of my back. This soon began to trouble me a good
deal, and I was often so bad that I coyld hardly move. I took medicine of all
kinds, but I got no better, and sometimes I used to wonder if ever I would be
free of the nagging ache. Well, to make a long story short, I at last got Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, and they soon fixed me up, a short course banishing the
ailment completely, and I have not suffered with my kidneys since.”
Pour years later Mr. Spence says : —“I have had no return, of .my old complaint
since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me four years ago.”
A WOMAN’S CASE.
Mrs. J. Smith, Bonnie Doon, Duncan Street, Arncliffe, Sydney, says:—“My
kidneys were in a bad way for some time and I suffered terribly from
backache in consequence. I could not stoop freely; in fact, all my movements
were handicapped owing to the nagging ache that used to catch me across the
kidneys. My rest at night was broken, and during the day I felt tired and
languid, having no energy for anything. I was advised to try Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills, so sent for some at once. They worked wonders in my case, giving
relief almost immediately and gradually effecting a complete cure. Six years
have elapsed since I used Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and I have been well
all that time.”
Five years later Mrs. Smith says—“l still have great faith in Doan's Back-
ache Kidney Pills. I always keep a bottle in the house, and whenever I feel a
little off color take a. few doses, and I am soon quite all right again.”

heat. He did not hear them. He walked
on, he broke into a run, as if the sun’s rays
had fired his clothing. The sweat slipped
into his eyes, distorting his vision. He stag-
gered blindly through a landscape that
whirled open on wildly clattering hinges.
Something seemed to be whispering to
him out of the lieat-liaze, as if it wanted to
bring some suggestions home to his dazed
brain. He stopped to listen and the whisper
ceafeed. He went on again and it was at
his elbow once more. If he could only catch
the words he felt they would solve his per-
plexities, salve his conscience.
If you have known Darwin only in the
dry season you have a mere half-impression
of her. She is then a drab, dishevelled
creature, lacking even the instinct for self-
adoirnment. She has the unwiped dirt of
months of desert winds on her face. The
foliage of her trees droops like broken lmt-
plumes. Her skirts trail in the dust. Her
back bends to the scourge of the wind, while
she looks seaward with tired, hopeless eyes
for the raincloud that never comes. But
with the breaking of the drought she gets
her spring. She dons a wonderful garment.
She glows with all the hues of the Orient.
The oleanders and the bougainvilleas run, a
Hood of pink and white blossoms, over the
verandah-roofs. Strange vivid blooms glow
everywhere amongst the dark, big-leaved
trees: yellow laburnums, yellow-belled ala-
mandas, white and yellow frangipanni. Livid-
hued crotons gleam in the shadows. Last
copies the poinciana, bursting across the grey
sky above the houses in a glorious riot of
scarlet.
The suggestion was all around him. It
wap in the jaundiced yellow of the labur-
nums, in the hectic flushing of the oleanders.
It was in the white blossoms of the flowering
gums, spotting out like symptoms of disease;
in the sick eyes of the crotons. It breathed
in the too-rank perfume of the frangipanni,
the flower of the dead.
In the still, hot calm following a thunder-
storm, he crept down to the foreshore. He
felt something sinister in the land, as if
it had some (lire intention towards him, as
if it were trying to whisper that suggestion
to 'him—-a suggestion that was wholly evil.
It was horrible; he could not shut it out.
The soil was like red meat and the straggling
vegetation of the milk-trees like some hideous
gangrene upon it. The sky was low and
scowling and- the sea lay under it, flat,
unstreaked, brooding, its color a pale and
opalescent green, one wash to the horizon.
The ; fishing-luggers gleamed white and
motionless upon it —not seeming to float- -
like bones half-sunk in slime. The cliffs
bled into the water, and beneath them the
P er lay out on the sea like a black, skinny
arm, stretching out long Sneers to seize the
hull of the steamer just manoeuvring out of
reach. At Puttrell’s back, like an effusion
of blood, burned the blood-red clusters of
the poinciana.
Nature hung out everywhere the same
sign. It was death. The suggestion was in
all things: on the face of the earth and in
the preying of one thing on another. He
brushed an ineffectual hand across his eyes.
The scarlet blossoms of the poinciana spelt
out murder. There, under the white blaze
of noon, it seemed the only way. It would
be an act of mercy, he told himself. It
would save her from all the years of dumb
suffering. He would be spared the agony
of watching. And any longer he could not
stand and look. It would drive him mad-|-
if he were not mad already. In those blood-
ied flowers he read her sentence.
But, in - the Cool truce of the evening, in
the midst of the union of all tilings—the
green leaves, the faint blossoms, the dim
earth—to a community of shadow; in the
face of the cleanness of sky and air, new-
washed by showers, the deed acquired a
terrible aspect. He began to aloubt his
motive. There seemed less of heroism in it.
Perhaps he was merely mad. Perhaps a
touch of the sun and the sight of that
cursed poinciana had bred the wild fancies
in his brain. So many strange ideas had
passed through his head of late: he could
not remember them all. Still, he had made
up his mind. The brave little laugh of his
wife, winging a flight to old altitudes as
she wished him “good-night,” shook his reso-
lution as no later pleading might have done.
lie sat without movement for hours, while
the moon swung oyer . the sky. In the
Chinese quarter below him the last red lan-
tern failed. A pale ’light grew in the east.
The sky drew in her myriad stars. Amongst
the leaves a faint breeze was released; a
bird sang suddenly, and away down the hill
he heard a steamer’s siren wail. It was the
warning note of departure of the vessel lie
had seen approaching the wharf. He dared
not Face the light of another day, shining on
the poineianas. Let his conscience call him
coward. He went softly indoors and packed
a bag.
It was in a hotel in Sydney that I found
them again. They had not taken up a more
permanent abode because they frankly in-
tended to return. They could afford to laugh
at his obsession now. His flight and her
pursuit, following on his morbid, self-accusa-
tory letter of explanation, were, in the light
of his subsequent sanity, things to smile at.
Complexion, he had discovered, was no sure
criterion of health. There -were other plati-
tudes he uttered, with a proud eye on his,
wife, such as that beauty is onlv skin-deep,
which was singularly malapropos in the face
of her pale prettiness and the sweet nature
of her disposition. Their baby, he declared,
with a note of challenge in his voice, was
going to prove whether a certain territory
were white man’s country or not. They both
expressed the hope to be back next Novem-
ber to see the poineianas in full bloom.
M.G. SKIPPER.
A Knight Near Home.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I WATCHED him for a while, then
summed him up. He sat in, the !
same moping position for about a
quarter of an hour. Even when the gang-
plank was thrown off, and the ropes smacked
and. clattered. and 10 deckhands and wharf
officials yelled and whistled to let the cap-
tain know the boat was free, he still sat
leaning forward. His forearms hung
loosely over his knees. A dead cigarette
stuck out from a gap between two of his
upper front teeth. His eyes were as thick
and as cloudy as swamp mist.
Two deckhands down below raised their
voices in loud melody. A harsh roar asked
them to stop. The engines groaned and
grunted and shook the boat. A man began
lo play a concertina. A chocolate Doy
whistled shrilly. After five minutes of this,
the.concertina stopped suddenly: it sounded
as though someone had crept up behind the
player and quietly murdered him. A hor-
rible silence followed. The evil swish of
water, against the boat’s s.de seemed only
a more solid form of stillness. The miser-
able wretch I was watching stared at some-
thing he was thinking about, and never as
much as blinked through it all.
A white flash-beacon glared in at the win-
dows. He seemed dazed back to conscious-
ness by it. Then, just as he was sinking
again lhjo his trance, liis eyes lit. He lifted
his hands and braced them against his knees,
sitting lor a moment like that, quite motion-
less. Then he got up slowly and turned
round, rested his hands on the sill of the
window and, leaning out, gazed down for
some minutes.
When lie drew back he sighed as if he was
satisfied. Quite smartly now he stepped on
the seat and threw the window wide open.
The boat rocked a little and he swayed with
it carelessly. What he was about to do did
not seem to strike me at first. Then my mind
cleared and I sprang to my feet as he stepped
on to the sill, and leapt out.
The quickness of ail this seemed to have
numbed a blank space in my brain. I had
watched a man murder himself and had en-
joyed the thrill of it just as though it had
been a picture-show ! So absorbed had I been
in speculating as to what was on his mind
that I had not even thought of rushing over
and stopping the fool.
A woody crash sounded against the out-
side of the boat. 1 rushed across, leant out
of the window, and saw a boot. It strug-
gled feebly. The cord of a lifebuoy had
been tied carelessly and had unravelled a
little. The suicide had caught his foot in
it as he jumped, had swung round in a heavy
Circle with the momentum, and had crashed,
head down, against the side of the boat.
I dragged him back through the window,
propped him in the seat he had just left, and
watched his astonished gape with enjoyment.
“How was that?” I asked rather proudly.
He raised his eyes slowly and looked in
my face with a vacant, far-away expression-
lessness for a few moments: then, without
shifting any other part of his body in the
slightest, or losing the dull, blank look, he
lunged out with his fist and knocked my chin.
I collapsed. He rose dreamily and kicked
me twice in the ribs. I rolled hurriedly out
of his reach, and he followed slowly, prepar-
ing for another kick.
One leg being raised for this purpose, the
whole of his weight was thrown on the
other. I jerked it from under him, and he
dropped like a loose bag of flour, rising
almost, immediately, without the slightest
expression of hurt, to climb back on the
window-sill.. Before he could jump I had
again grabbed him. He looked round at me
over his shoulder, sighed, and threw himself
down with all his weight on my head. I
heard my neck crick. Chinese lanterns
swirled round me in myriads. Tin whistles
dinned shrilly afar off. Then half-a-dozen
pairs of feet came pattering up-the stair-
way, and I instinctively yelled “Help . ’
With a cry the madman broke away, leapt
to his knees, and aimed a wild clout at my
head. It missed killing me, and grazed one
of my ears partly off. Then he sprang again
to the window. Again I grabbed him. Again
we hurtled to the floor. This time, how-
ever, I was uppermost. The knowledge
that help was at hand lent me strength. I
grasped him none too gently bv the ears,
and held his head.. . .down. . . .firmly !
The rush of feet reached the top of the
stairs. Someone yelped with surprise. The
feet pattered swiftly behind me. A voice
swore breathlessly. A million pinpoints ot
blood-red light leapt in from all directions
and rained in on' my eyes. Something like
a bar of iron struck me squarely behind the
ear. A burst of vile language- floated in
dreamily to my consciousness. . . .and I knew,
vaguely, that "it referred, for some unfathom-
able reason, to me!
A pair of pincers gripped me by the coat
collar. An elephant clumped me heavily
on each side of the head with his trunk. 1
felt myself sailing lightly, sleepily, through
the air.
A policeman woke me, dragged me into
court from my cell, and pushed me into the
dock. The presiding beak told me what he
thought of my ruffianly conduct, expressed
his intention of making an example of me,
fined me heavily for assault with intent to
rob; cautioned me and let me go. Only for
the protection of the nolice I might have
been torn to pieces by the crowd outs.de the
court. I lost my position over the business
and spent all next day looking for a job.
About 10 o’clock that night, giving it up,
I caught a ferry for home, and, dropping
into the nearest seat —one just in front of
the gangway—l dozed with exhaustion.
When I awoke a figure was standing at
the gang-rail, leaning over and gazing down.
The man drew back suddenly and shuddered;
then, shaking his head, muttered : “Mo! Not
that! Not that! Poison, perhaps, but not
that!” He straightened himself resolutely.
“Anyhow, Smary iflnickfide might, if I ask
her, send me one of those curls of hers. She
can get plenty more. I’d buy her as many
as she liked if she asked me”
I stepped up behind him and tapped him
on the shoulder.
“I am the chap that saved you from sui-
cide,” I said.
He looked up into my face. There were
tears in his eyes. He threw his hand out
impulsively.
“Shake,” he said.
I took the hand, jerked it forward, stooped,
grabbed his ankle and tipped him overboard.
The water rushed by. A face appeared
for a moment in a smother of side-wash. A
far, faint shout came—like an echo, or the
call of a seagull. A deckhand rushed out
from the inside of the boat and cried: “What
was that?”
“It sounded like ‘Little Nell’ on the
gramophone,” I said. He looked at me
strangely.

RELIABILITY
X . ' - ' , .
Reliability—the crowning
virtue of Dewar’s. All its
merits in distillation, blending,
purity, age and flavour con-
tribute to this one great end
that no matter when or where
you buy Dewar’s you can,
without any fear of d isillusion-
ment, rely on an unvarying
measure of rarest pleasure
that makes Dewar’s a perfect
treasure.
