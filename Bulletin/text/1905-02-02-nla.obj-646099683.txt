Beautiful Australia.
[The response to the request for personal statements of
the most beautiful “ view ” in Australia was an Inunda-
tion. To say which is the “ best ” description is a matter
for Solomon ; and we have given up the task of endeavour-
ing to weigh and adjust in MS. Eligible contributions
will be printed until there are no more ; and judgment is
deferred.]
Over Perth Water, Westralia.
OVER Perth Water a soft afternoon sky,
with the sun half-veiled in cloud, brightens
into a delicate glow towards evening,
with apricot tints edging horizon clouds ;
rifts in the dove-coloured sky show faint gleams
of blue, and the water is gray, but of a tone warm
and tender, for river and sky are only, as it were,
like some large, gray opal with a suggestion of
rose and carmine shining through.
And the opal is set among sapphires; bound-
ing the eastern view the Darling Hills are
deep blue merging into purple, and the far
bush running towards, the hills takes the violet
colour which belongs essentially to distant
gum-trees. It is an effect as of jewels set deep in
the breast of the world, shining with a lialf-sub-
dued light, with its soft radiance quenched in the
transient dusk and in the brightening of wonder-
ful Australian stars; or, again, should one seek
further analogy, as of flowers spreading out purple
calices and petals touched faintly with sunset
colour in a world already waking up to its evening
enchantment. For at evening tune the West
Australian bush takes to itself something of the
mystery and the passion to which its heart re-
mained closed all through the day; and like a
apell-bound, fairy-tale princess, it opens wide
eyes, still dim with slumber, at a given hour:
seeming to oast some of the glamour of its long
dreaming over the far stretches of its trees, those
that are quivering and picked out in a thousand
unwonted shades in the light of the level sun.
This hour draws near now, when the trees
against the sky-line begin to take strange shapes,
as of old-world castles and beetling fortresses
guarding the boundaries of some further land
beyond the edges of an illimitable bush.
The black swans of the Swan River are seen
down below like moving specks where the sand
shows golden-yellow in the shallows. Small
yachts are slipping home; and brightening
strangely, and mystically, in this light, the
flowering-gums that look out across the water
burn and flame in vivid vermilions and Chinese
reds—like torches held aloft, high upon the slopes
facing the mountains, to lialf-awakened bush-
spirits, hill and tree demons, geniuses of creek
and slow bush-river, who are making ready now
for their twilight play.
E.L.D.
A VIEW FROM THE RAZORBACK.
North Coast railway, (Queensland.
TARTING out of a flat plain, the road from
Palm woods begins to climb the Razorback
at a sharp angle. From an avenue of inter-
leaved palms it creeps out white and
glistening, and ascends The steep sides' spirally.
At the summit it creeps through dark-grey scrub
unlit by any ray of light. Then suddenly the
trees grow fewer. The thick straight boles become
irregular, then altogether cease, and the white
shimmering sunlight dazzles the eyes of the
beholder. It is as though a door had opened in
the darkness, and a flood of light burst through.
This is the edge of the tableland—a grassy pro-
montory jutting out into space. The view is a
. mystery of lights and half-lights ss the shadows
race from one clear-cut hill to another; and the
colours vary as the pearl-grey clouds pass across
the sun. Hundreds of feet below, the branchy
trees meeting together form a mat of the darkest
green, vocal with myriad singing-birds. In
patches the dew-drenched ferns grow dense and
tall, running into dark granite caves where the
sunbeams never enter. The sides of the cliff are
clothed with stunted mararas, cumbered with
parasitic growths of staghorns and elk-horns.
Miles on miles towards the sea stretch the
unbroken lines of kujaree and cedar. The
various shades of green are relieved in places by a
trenchant note of scarlet, where the beanwood
blossoms break through in clusters like sets of
rubies. And, as a frame to the picture, flowing
between straight and level banks, comes the
Maroochy river, shining in the light like a stream
of molten silver.
On the right, brown and white hills are sil-
houetted against the turquoise sky. Their sloping
sides are specked with vineyards and orchards,
filled with bananas and mangoes. The bases are
hidden in groves of impenetrable pine.
In the distance the blood-red flame-trees blaze
vividly against the purple haze which dimly
covers the hillocks and the sempiternal gums, and
glowing with the brightness of the sun on the sea
lie the miles on miles of milk-white ocean beach.
The blacks, with a vague consciousness of its
beauty, have called this place Caloundra—the
Vision Beautiful.

View from Mount MaoMichael.
Blue Tier Range, North-Eastern Tasmania.
OF a height sufficient to enable us from the
vantage point of hi-s clean granite Crest
to sec, on a yellow December evening,
one-third of the Island fotate, stands
Mount MaoMichael.
The grim desolation which is always exhibited
on the highest elevations of lofty peaks rooted m
lands remote from the Equator is not his portion,
but a mountain need not tower like Chimborazo
to gain the glory of beauty or the grandeur of
solemnity.. He knows the snow, that garment
which the storm-winds often fling upon his shoul-
ders, but he casts it from him at the first whisper
of spring. Let dead volcanoes crumble beneath
their eternal winding-sheets, he loves to see his
slopes clothed with the fragrant celery-top pine
and the murmuring myrtle. Seat yourselves
beside me on his rocky forehead, as Xerxes sat
o’er Salamis, and behold the beauty of the bush.,
the majesty of the mountains, the splendour of
the sea.
Beneath us and westward for leagues is myrtle
forest, wherein are the sources of many waters.
The dark-bronze foliage, flooded by the light of
the sinking summer sun, becomes one immense
shimmering carpet of old gold. Here and there
clumps of the symmetrical sassafras and pine
may be seen flashing in this mighty play
of almost living iridescence. In the south-west is
Ben Lomond with clear and bold outline, his un-
sullied snow-fields making magnificent contrast
With the deep azure of the distant horizon. East-
ward lies the Tasman Sea. Afar off, but distant,
the lighthouse stands on the northern horn of the
Eay of Fires. We look down along the coast to
Jjichens, the Sehouten main, and the island which
bears the name of the daughter of Van Diemen.
-Lo the north is Mount Cameron. Beyond his
ru 8f>ed brows glisten the high, violet-coloured
slopes of Minders and the other islands of the
fatraits. I he tides are racing through the narrows,
and the spray gleams as the rival waters of east
and west break upon each other.
The sea breeze touches the myrtles, and they
send forth a sigh softer than song as before
descending the mountain we bestow one lingering
look on the blue waters which stretch away
towards the Australian shore.
J.D.
On the Murray Valley, Victoria.
ON one green hill you stand and let a pleased
eye range for miles around over a varied
beauty of scene. The little town lies,
set about with gentle undulations, built
itself upon seven—nay, twice seven hills, which
rise and recede in terraces, ending many miles off,
in a chain of noted mountains. Sometimes these
mountains look blue and near us ; sometimes
white and cold, but not so for long, for our sun-
shine is generous, and fails us never.
Sometimes (and these are the days we like best
of all) the hills look grey and beautiful and afar
off, mysterious in their aloofness, till we long for
the wings of the wild bird, and to follow the wind
and touch those mountains, and so on, till we compass
the world. For the beauties of nature call to
man, and his inmost soul responds, else is he a
clod.
Then comes the river through my chosen
view. Deep and broad, abundantly full; at sight
of which many weary eyes do gladden, and tired
feet stay themselves : the hungry feed and are
satisfied, for the pastures are green and restful.
And all is dotted and fringed with waving gums
shimmering in an atmosphere of crystalline
clearness, which makes the sun by day and
the moon and the stars by night to shine with
scintillations unseen in a cloudier clime. The
kingfisher and the blue wren make their nests
hereabout, nor is any bird or song of bird a-want-
ing to entrance these woods. Such is my chosen
view as God made it.
Now set upon this beauteous ground (and
not unworthy such a setting) many busy
homes; vineyards planted in rows of such
elegant neatness and regularity as to delight the
artistic eye: vary it with cornfields and orchards,
bordered by trim walks and well-kept hedges, evi-
dences of careful husbandry, and you have a scene
of which every prospect pleases : the air sweet
with the smelling of ripe figs, apples, and other
fruits ripening in the sun, and of wine, which in
cellar cool is steadying itself into purity and
strength, as might the heart of man in such fair
environment. For we take tone from beautiful
surroundings, as the Prodigal, on recalling the
sweetness of his father's home, cast off the husks
and roughness of the wilderness and turned him
once again to grace and loveliness.
M.B.
: —♦
On the-Baboo River, New South Wales.
[Over 400 words. Disqualified.]
I HAVE read of the refreshing mental activity,
the languid physical depression, and the
broken necks acquired in thescalingof Alpine
peaks, the excitement and relief from daily
cares obtainable from a quiet pursuit of the
grizzly in the Rockies, the pleasures derivable
from snaring boa-constrictors in the “impene-
trable ” forests of the Amazon valley, and the
healthy pastime of slaying tigers in an Indian
jungle. As a relief from worldly toil such frolics
have their value, some even going to the ex-
tremity of giving permanent peace. But my ideal
sanitarium for the perturbed mind is Ularara on
the Paroo River, in far-back New South Wales.
I do not like it because it is a place, but because
it’s not. It’s nowhere. It is shown on the
official map solely out of respect to a shanty which
once stood on the Paroo, five miles below the
townlet of Wanaaring, where the publican doled
out his nips of local rum and bottled lunacy.
There still remains sufficient of the ruins to
indicate where stood the liar, not so much the
architecture of the building, as the blue upon the
walls of one old room, left there by Time in token
of some shearer’s spree. Close by are the remains
of the stables and cowyard, the indispensable
hitch-posts where stockmen “hung their horses
up,” and a small split-rail enclosure denoting
reverence to the memory of a “planted ” bushman.
Drought upon drought lias devastated this region,
and the merry “hands” who passed, or rather
pulled up at, this wayside inn, no longer “follow
sheds ” along this road.
The Paroo has ceased to run. It is no longer a
river, but a succession of more or less boggy water-
holes and lignum swamps. The country round is
of a sandy nature, covered in favoured seasons with
spinach and other herbage of ephemeral growth.
One blast from a heat-wave will blacken and
shrivel it to nothing. Away from the river-
channel the larger growth is chiefly buntha-bush
and honeysuckle, interspersed with leopard-wood,
blood-wood,, white-wood, and shaggy, stunted,
beef-wood. At intervals ironstone ridges inter-
vene, and no vegetation is visible. From the bed
of the river rise ill-grown gum and box trees.
Here the undergrowth flourishes; reeds, weeds
and rushes intertwine in utmost riot and confusion.
But everything is peaceful. Caryapundies
(water-fowl), pelicans, cranes, wild geese, bald
coots, black duck, wood-duck, teal and snipe
wander thoughtlessly and undisturbed amid the
swamps in quest of food; cockatoos, rosellas,
corelias, shell, and every other species of par-
rot, gambol among the branches of the trees,
sipping honey from the blossoms ; the timid emu
aucl stately brolga (native companion) stalk aim-
lessly in couples making love ; and the ubiquitous
crow “karks ’ dismally over the carcase of some
deiid beast. Apart from the shanty’s ruins, the
only signs that man has ever invaded this haven
of oblivion are rude holes cut in trees by aborigines
in search of game. But the black is gone, and all
is quiet. Impenetrable solitude, and soothing
silence ! Give me a tent and “tucker” and I’ll
camp for ever!

Calur/iet “ K,” commended as the most typical
American novel and a fascinating piece of journal-
ism, is republished at Is. by Macmillan ; and is
worth anybody’s shilling.
It is apologised to a dozen of correspondents
whose “Story Endings” were thrown out from a
mixture of competition-dates ; and the following
have been judged anew : F.B. ; Bamboo ; H.S.L. ;
A.M.O. ; B.G.A. ; A.M.D. ; Gune; Tariwa ;
Edn ; Hiphen ; G.M. ; Harry ; F.C. ; S.A.E. ;
T.S. ; G.C.W. ; A.M.8.R.; J.D. ; Boh ; The
Hack. None of these, however, contained the
winning combination of suicide and lover’s com-
ment, and the result is unaltered.
A HEART OF HONEY.
/SA W it in a sunset mood
(The mood that charms and mellows),
A grey and, ancient shell of wood
Among its forest felloivs.
I said, “ Old tree, your days are done,
And gone your airs and graces ;
The birds that came at set of sun
Seek elsewhere greener places.
“ All gone the green and leafy dome
Where golden beetles rested,
And gone the soft as velvet home
Where honeysuckers nested.
“ The feathered minstrels sang to you:
Their songs—do you remember ?
Remembered songs may thrill us through,
As wind a dying ember.
“ But tell me this, as tell you would,
If trees could talk—with pleasure, —
Of all the lyric brotherhood,
Who sang the sweetest measure ?
“ ' T was he who came at break of day
CBrown coat and beak of yellow),
And gave his soul in song away,
A thriftless singing fellow.”
“ He paused a space, upon your limb,
And then went idly winging ;
He cared for none, none cared for him,
He only loved his singing.
“ His green tree-audience stretched for miles,
They seemed like gods assembled ;
He filled the forest's secret aisles
With songs that sighed and trembled.
“ But he is gone from leaf and bough
(Gay beak and sombre feather),
And nothing stirs or chills him now,
Grey skies or sunny weather.”
11.
I saw it when with gladsome sound
And song of glee and pleasure,
Two honeyseekers gathered round
To thieve its golden treasure.
Soft eyes were there among 'the thieves,
And ripe lips redly pouted
‘‘‘Come, fire these ferns,” she said, “and leaves,
Till all the bees be routed .”
The Blue smoke rose, the bees crept out,
They silaned to pause 1 aid wonder,
And then took icing and wheeled about
Their place of golden plunder.
“Now, take your axe and cut the tree —
Just here,” she said, “ and hurry;
Of all earth's things I think the bee
Is sure the greatest worry.”
I said, ‘ ‘ He’s weighted with his woes,
Else now, aid, at this minute,
He 'd think your mouth a scarlet rose,
And seek for honey in it.”
The hole was made, the honey-home,
With spoil of flowers past telling,
We plundered.of its golden corah
With amber richness welling.
I said, “ When toil is done there wakes
The heart’S'desire for pleasure.”
Said she, “ I'll make you honey-cakes
And mead to drink at leisure.”
“ Not honey-cakes nor mead will do ;
These things one else might proffer ;
But that which you, and only you,,
Have in your grace to offer.”
She smiled; she seemed a woodland thing,
All lit with love, and sunny.
She said, “ Who dares the wild bee's sting
Deserves a meed of honey.”
I took my meed, I said, Tis Love—
That bird of idle winging —
It drops from heavens of blue above
To glad us with its singing.”
A charmed light touched us where we stood
(A light of love that mellows)
Beside that ancient shell of wood
That shamed its forest fellows.
And then a wish took shape and stirred,
A wish beyond all money,
In Youth to have a singing bird.
In Age a heart of honey.
N.S.YV.
R.Q.
RECEIVED
Helen Alliston, by the author of Elizabeth’s
Children (Bond., Lane ; 2s. (id. ) A book of
charming children—really the most charming
children : they are irresistible. A tolerable love-
storv threads in and out among the children : but
luckily the children are unawed. To all mothers
and fathers (and to those who will be) the story is
commended. To miss it is to miss joy.
The Storm of London, by F. Dickberry (Lond.,
Long; 2s. 6 d.). By a fantastic miracle (“in a
man’s mind”) all London loses its clothes (in a
man’s madness) and moralises on the nude (in a
man’s dream). The book is no child of the
miracle: it seems daring and is rather dull
despite some smartness.
Dear Fatherland, by ex-Lieut. Bilse (Lond.,
Lane ; 2s. (id.). Another picture of German army
life by the author of A Little Garrison Town —a
picture of bestiality and brutality almost unre-
lieved. Like its predecessor’s, the book’s value is
as a moral lesson in militarism : the translation, at
least, makes no literary appeal, though incidental
passages of sexual psychology are well observed.
There are so many asterisked amours that the
publisher could not haVe ventured it in an English
setting : as the scene is Swinburne’s “ Germany
reptile in rancour,” prudish blushes will disappear
in the glow of British patriotic bias.
MEMORANDA
It was a lady who complained of a rhyme in
Hebblethwaite’s “Elia.”
Charming Sex ! —so sure, so uncertain. “II Taut
souifrir pour etre ” rebelle. “His Reply” ran :
The Athenrmfn announces the death from
“heart failure” of Norman Maccoll, for many
years its editor. Unexpected comment comes
from The Hawklet, a Melbourne religious paper,
which points out shrewdly that “ heart failure ” is
not a specific disease ; that nobody dies unless sis
heart fails ; and that the newspaper phrase
“ heart failure ” is' essentially as ridiculous as
“police intelligence.”
“ ‘ The one manifesting his intellectual activity
in Literature and the other in Art,’” quotes Ed.
Burne-dones—“capital letters, of course, to mark
the antithesis. What rot it all is ! As if literature
was not art. Why literature is only literature
because it is art, and for no other reason. It is
art that makes paintings pictures, and it is art
makes verses poems ; literature cannot do it any
more than painting can.”
Wonderful America !—so vast, so enterprising,
so serenely humourless despite sporadic Twains
and Dooleys. It has improved Chaucer into
“modern English prose,” with “illustrations in
colour ” on the tawdry most-modern plan ; and
this-, for example, is highly commended to eager
Chautauqua :
“There was eke a nun, a Prioress, that was of her
smiling full simple and quiet. Pier greatest oath was hut
by St. Loy... Full well she sang divine service, full seemly
intoned in her nose. And French she spake fair and
prettily after the School of Stratford-atte-Bow, for to her
French of Paris was unknown. At meat she was well
taught ; she let no morsel fall from her lips, nor wet her
fingers deep in the sauce. She ,pould carry well a morsel,
and take good heed that no drop fell on her breast. Full
much she took pleasure in g-ood breeding.”
Civilisation is a failure :it is,.it is.
“ Human personality ”—D. Syme’s “soul,” te
wit —“ is only an aggregate of reflexes, or rather an
aggregate of perceptions : it has no real existence
as an entity. It is not an element superadded to
the organism, for it depends at the last on the
organism itself. The sole obstacle to reaching a
more perfect conception of this personality, has
been, and is, purely and simply the use of spiritual-
istic terminology” —D. Syme’s “soul,” to wit.
D. A. Remond, author of a just-published Precis
des Maladies Mentales from which this passage is
quoted, points out that it is only this dear
materialist notion of personality which permits a
true interpretation of mental disorders, whose
origins besides are found on all levels of the
nervous system. Remond adds-that the human
brain is still undergoing an evolutionary process
of formation, and that an increase of lunacy is to
be expected while the imperfect hemispheres are
developing. He thinks the direction of develop-
• ment is clearly towards a cortex divided into
ganglia adapted by functional use to a particular
role.
“Bal/.ac’s life,” says a Lond.. Times writer,
“ somehow reminds one of a motor-ear, irresistible
in its velocity, and panting even when it is sup-
posed to be at rest.” •
“ And as for them bagpipes,” writes a jaundiced
critic, “he simply blew the remains of all the
sounds since the flood out of the big end — he took
silence by her hind leg and flapped her into rags.”
A.G.S.
Oh, Hebblethwaite, your culture fine
Lacks some essential knowledge,
They’d call yon an aborigine (/ l)
At any British, College.
Your writer's wits are, gathering wool,
In A ustral slums you ’re dawdlin' ;
The merest, babe in English school
Knows “ Magdalene ” is “ Maudlin .**
No, Lady, no ; for once yon 're wrong,
’T was not for lack of knowledge
I wrote within my little song
The name of “ Maudlin ” College
As Magdalene—so, Lady , please
Believe me I do n o t. feign,
But here I give in truth with ease
My reason in a quatrain ;
Of words of perfect beauty there are three
With savour sweet of love and “ might have been,”
A potm each that, may not shortened be :
“ April,” and “ Violet,” and “ Magdalene.”

grateful letters we have from those who had been ill and were cured by
Electricity, after all other treatment had failed. Surely such endorsement is
worthy of the serious consideration of every ailing man or woman ! Surely
Health Seekers would like to know something of its merits! Every oppor-
tunity is afforded those who will write to us, as . . .

LIKE HISTORY IT REPEATS ITSELF
As a means of pleasure and sport, the Winchester Automatic
Rifle is as far ahead of any other .22 Caliber as an automobile
is ahead of the historic one-horse shay. After loading this
rifle, all that it is necessary to do to shoot it ten times is to
pull the trigger for each shot. Although automatic in action,
it is simple in construction and not apt to get out of order.
For city, country or camp it is the gun of the day.

Various Verses.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
City of Desire.
“ ‘ How many miles to Babylon ? ’
‘ Threescore and ten.’
‘ Can I be there by candlelight ? ’
‘ 0, yes, and back again. ’
' Then open the gates as high as the sky,
‘ And let the king and his men pass by.’"
How many miles to Babylon ?
Three-score and ten.
0, long and weary are the miles
That seemed so little then !
For the king and his men are old and grey
And bent with the weight of years,
Their feet are weary of the way,
Their eyes are dim with tears.
And the gates which opened so wide and high
Are barred and bolted tight;
And no one hears our eager cry,
And no one brings a light.
Babylon ! Babylon ! City of Desire,
Far across the hills wo can see thy shining spire ;
And our hearts are sick with longing for the
mystic, distant town,
But the gates are shut and bolted, and we cannot
force them down.
Our voices fail and falter, singing still the ancient
rhyme,
For the king is old and feeble, and his men are
past their prime.
Babylon ! Babylon ! Long and long ago
Straying childish feet have stood within thy city
walls ;
Our ears have heard thy music, pealing loud or
floating low ;
Our eyes have seen the beauty and the splendor
of thy halls;
But the childish feet were restless and something
urged us on.
We sought again the backward path of three-
score miles and ten;
We left thy glory and thy peace, O, mystic
Babylon,
And gaily ere the candle-light we all came back
again.
And now we are weeping for Babylon,
When the gates are shut and the light has gone;
For steep is the road and long the way
That seemed so short to us yesterday.
And we cry aloud with a bitter cry,
“ O, let the king and his men pass by ! ”
Would we were now where we wandered then,
Never more to come back again.
N.s.w.
RUTH M. BEDFORD.
Half-Way Haven.
This shall be home,
This cove where the creeks come laughing down,
Whispering tales of a verdurous mother-land
To the old dark sea.
I am tired of roads that roam,
And buffeting billows and ominous skies that frown
Relentless. lam weak, unmanned,
This shall be home for me.
Years ago I was young,
I sprang to the boats and sped to the light beyond
That smiled, like evening sunlight on the grass,
Along each laughing wave.
I sung as white clouds sung,
And met fond morn with looks and smiles as fond—
Here haggard and old I fail, the dream shall
pass . . .
Years ago I was young and strong and brave.
The light is too far away.
My strained eyes have sickened while my hand
Froze to the helm, and youth that made me strong
Falls. Yea . . . and I must fall.
Here I shall wither and stay,
And know of my life’s unreached, empurpled land,
Sometimes in the morning a word, or at even a
song,
And this shall be all!
I shall go no farther now;
There is no farther to go for one so weak;
I shall draw my boat up on the yellow sands,
And lie beside and sleep.
Youth, cruel enchanter thou,
I shall not sing, I shall not laugh nor speak,
O, stricken heart, O withering, impotent hands,
I shall not dream nor weep.
FURNLEY MAURICE.
The Bangle.
I gave a bangle to my love,
Wherein two hearts were twined—
Fond tokens, which some am’rous smith
Had cunningly designed.
She took it, and she plighted troth
To love no man but me ;
And I walk’d, smiling, by her side
As happy as could be.
The clock went round, the seasons fled,
They fled and came again ;
The sun shone bright, the breezes blew,
The clouds poured down their rain.
But now, alas !—some scurvy trick
Of Eros, little doubt —
We never met but she would turn
A rapid round-about.
She married some old merchant man,
Grown fat on roguery;
While I, a humble clerk, retained
My bachelor degree.
A little while, and yet I saw
My bangle once again.
’Twas used to cut the milk-teeth of
A second Mary J ane!

Weak Nerved People
This is to people who lack courage, whose nerves are
shaky, whose eyes have lost the sparkle, whose brains are
muddled, ideas confused, sleep restless, confidence gone,

them. It is to people who have part or all of these symp-
toms of nervousness and want new life, new force. We
offer it to you in the

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1905.
THE “FOREIGN CAPITAL” FETISH.
In no respect is Australia better served than in
the matter of life insurance. With, comparatively
speaking, a mere handful of people, it yet has one
life office which admittedly ranks among the
world’s best, and others which rank very high.
The huge American offices, as much the product
of Protection as the factories of Philadelphia or
Chicago, show larger aggregate figures, but their
expense rate is higher, their earnings are rather
lower, and they have to battle for business in
these parts on certainly no better than equal
terms with Australia’s own. As for the English
offices, one or two have tried to do business
in Australia, and have retired. It is a
great thing for the insurance drummer to be able
to say that his office is a couple of hundred years
or so old, and that it has never turned away a just
claimant unsatisfied ; and British offices could
send out their men with this to recommend them.
Yet they could do no business in competition with
Australian offices, in spite of the fact that the
Australian is a great insurer, who takes insurance
at the rate of £25 per head, while in the United
Kingdom the cover runs only to £l6, and in the
United States to £22. It is all an illustration of
how well the Australian can do things for himself
when he has faith in himself. Life insurance is
an intricate business, and yet the Australian is
not only capable of doing it, but he does it at
least as well as anybody in the world. His success
knocks flat the stupid suggestion that, without
competition, the Australian is a sort of brigand
who would, given the power, make everybody
smart for it. The insurance societies have practi-
cally got the power now, and internal competition
is quite sufficient to guarantee for the Australian
public a fair deal.

A British proprietary office, doing as much
business as the chief Australian office, would look
for profits amounting to anything up to
£200,000 a year. The Prudential industrial branch,
whose premiums are about twice as great, dis-
tributes among its shareholders £480,000 a year.
If Australia had been content to have its life in-
surance business done for it by foreign offices there
would have been this enormous annual drain into
foreign pockets. But, having for once had faith
in itself, Australia pockets its own profits, and is
thus able to increase its insurance and rejoice in
the almost phenomenal prosperity of its own
offices. Yet, with this example available, it
takes an almost opposite course in respect of most
other things. The Australian office is good enough
to take the risk of its life, but not of its furniture or
its haystack. There are 42 offices doing fire busi-
ness in Sydney, and only 12 of them have their
homes in the Commonwealth or Maoriland. The
risks in the Sydney metropolitan area total about
£74,000,000, and £35,000,000 of that is held by
foreign offices—many of them not even British
offices. The marine insurance business shows up
even worse. In N.S. Wales there are 19 offices
which confine themselves to marine insurance,
and the profits in every single case go out of
Australasia. _ There are Australian offices which
combine marine underwriting with fire insurance,
but even professedly Protectionist Governments
send their business to the foreigner. What the
total amount of profits which are thus drained out
of Australasia may be it is impossible to say. It is
certain, however, that much more than one-half
of the fire risks in Australia are held by foreign
companies. On their half, or less than half, of the
business, Australasian office's in the last year for
which accounts have beBn published made a profit
of £385,732. It is fair to assume that bn their
half, or more than half, of the business, the
foreign companies made that much, or more.
Nearly lialf-a-million lost to Australia in one year
in one comparatively small branch of business !
Yet nobody suggests that Australia is better
served in the matter of fire insurance than in the
matter of life insurance. What does it get, then,
in return for its annual half-million or so ?
* * * *
Coghlan, in “Australia and New Zealand,”
1903-4, finds that the absentee of all sorts bleeds
the Commonwealth and Maoriland to the tune of
£8,750,300 every year, in addition to the £9,352,000
which he draws as interest on public stocks. Aus-
tralasia’s traceable tribute to the foreigner is thus
£18,102,000 a year. It not only provides the
foreign workman with work, but also the foreign
capitalist with capital. Australia doesn’t even
receive capital from the foreigner to start with.
At the most it receives manufactured goods.
Often it doesn’t even receive that much.
An agent arrives with two pieces of
paper : a power of attorney and a bank guarantee.
Sometimes he doesn’t bring even those ; he
buys a brass plate and a tall hat, and begins to
“ write lines.” Often he doesn’t have to draw on
his principals for a penny. Australia provides his
capital—and presently his profits. Yet probably
he is less of a curse than the foreigner who arrives
with capital represented by a shipload of manu-
factured goods. The man who brings nothing can
at the worst only send his future profits out of the
country; the man who brings manufactures has
already sent wages out of the country, and driven
another nail in the coffin of Australian industries.

Maoriland shows the way to the remedy for
most of this. A few years ago its private debt
was in proportion to population simply stupendous.
Between 1880 and 1885 it rushed into foreign debt
on private account to the extent of £10,500,000.
In 10 years it had loaded itself with £19,000,000,
apart from extremely heavy public borrowings.
According to all the rules of the foreign-trader,
this enormous influx of capital ought to Have made
Maoriland magnificently prosperous. But instead
of prosperity there was a crash. The increase of
population, which had been at the rate of from 7
to 18 per cent., fell below 2 per cent. Between
1882 and 1891 the State gained by excess of immi-
gration over emigration only 2901 people. For
the first time in its history Maoriland, blessed with
all this foreign capital, was reckoned a good
place to stay away from. Then, having
seen what a fool it had made of itself,
Maoriland changed its plans. The man who
gibbered about the crime of “ scaring away
capital ” was told to consider what his mad policy
had done. Foreign capital meant foreign debt,
and Ballance proceeded to get rid of it. The
man who wanted to “introduce capital” (always
in the shape of manufactured goods) was met
by a Customs tariff. The State didn’t get any
more foreign debt, but it got factories instead ; it
didn’t provide wages (on credit) for foreign work-
men, but it provided some for its own workmen.
In the next 10 years it gained by excess of immi-
gration over emigration 35,078 people. It im-
posed a land-tax, and it proceeded to break up
large estates; and though it thus “drove out
capital” it brought in settlers. It reduced its
debt, but in 10 years it increased its savings bank
deposits from £3,9GG,849 to £8,432,959. It has so
effectually “driven out capital” that to-day more
than 98f per cent, of Maoriland’s income belongs
to Maorilanders, not counting in the public debt.
And there is so much satisfaction in being able to
pocket 98f per cent, of one’s own earnings that in
1902-3 Maoriland gained 16,267 persons by excess
of immigration over emigration, whereas the
Commonwealth States actually lost 5149.

Australia has made a fetish of “foreign capi-
tal ” ; and, for a start, it will have to kill its
fetish. It needs a patriotic faith in its own re-
sources, its own institutions, and itself. It needs
to treat as a public enemy the man who asks it to
get wildly excited over the fact that the note
which tells it about a new shipment of foreign
flannel may be a day late. If it must get excited,
let it get excited over the fact that some foreign
flannel is coming, while it has the wool, and
nothing more profitable for its own men to do than
shift sand. It needs to get into the habit of
thinking of foreign capital as foreign debt; and
when a shocked person says he intended to
“invest” £984,017 in Australia, but won’t, it
needs to more or less reverently thank God that
it has been saved from going that much deeper
into pawn for the privilege of cutting its own
workmen’s throats.
IN RUSSIA.
The facts, when they come to be known, will,
almost of a surety, lesson the tale of horror cabled
from Russia last week. The old habit of taking
care against printing anything but proved facts
has gone away from most newspapers, and the
modern anxiety is to be first to the front with a
tale of blood and ruin, content if it but have some
basis of truth. The press which shocked the
world with a tale of the utter slaughter of the
ambassadors and their staffs at Pekin —a slaughter
which had no foundation at all in fact, but which
cost his life to many an unhappy Chinaman —would
have no scruple in making as good a “story”
as possible of what is happening in St.
Petersburg. Likely enough definite news is
hard of getting. There is but a small regard
for the freedom of the press in Russia, and the
writers to foreign papers will be just now in the
position of war correspondents, strictly overlooked
by the censor. The truth being thus hard to get,
fancy runs the more free, and the half-penny
London newspaper, which becomes more and more
the fountain-head of European news for Australia,
is probably giving to its readers a full measure
of blo&d, heaped-up and overflowing, with
very little certainty, and about as much concern,
as to whether the facts will finally bear it out.
Yet, that notwithstanding, keeping in mind the
need for great care in taking as true the cables
from Europe, there can be no doubt that outrage
and murder have stained the snows of Russia,
and a relentless nobility has taken a blood-
thirsty revenge on the workers guilty of aspiring
to be free. Probably not so much has happened
as the newspapers here Have said, but enough to
oppress the heart with pity for a brave people
down-trodden, and with rage for a worthless
oligarchy triumphing in cruelty.
* • * «t
That there will be a revolution in Russia does
not, however, seem to be likely. A revolution,
even with the dread accompaniment of the French
upheaval, would be a dour remedy, but still a good
remedy for the evils.which afflict Russia. Sweep-
ing away priest power, king-power and class
privilege, it would give new strength to the great
Russian nation. But there is little chance of such
a stern and sudden stop to class-power in Russia.
There has been there none of the tillage before-
hand which made France’s regeneration in blood
possible. It was not Danton, Mabat nor
Robespierre who sent king and priest
and noble to the knife, and washed out centu-
ries of wrong with days of slaughter. Before
them and behind them were the real leaders of
the revolt, Voltaire, the smug correspondent
of King Frederick, Rousseau, Diderot, and the
rest. They it was who first sapped the walls
which the revolutionaries afterwards cast down.
Attacking first the defences which religion had
set up for class power, the intellectual leaders of the
French revolution found blind helpers in the
nobles whose destruction they were compassing.
No stand was made when these first trenches were
carried, and they proved to be the key to the for-
tress of privilege. The nobles wlio delighted to help
the sneering sceptics when the attack seemed to be
on the priest alone brought themselves up to the
edge of the scaffold ; and the other steps were easy.
In Russia there has been no corresponding intel-
lectual- movement to lay a foundation for the
barricade. The church stands in that country
four-square and strong. The few schismatics who
have cast off its authority are mostly visionaries and
..incapables. No widespread philosophy of doubt
threatens the stability of the Greek communion.
The greatest dissident intellectual force, that of
Tolstoi, pleads always for obedience and non-
resistance. Until Russia has its Voltaire it will
not have its revolution. Very probably it will
never need either, and will, following in the foot-
steps of England, broaden from an autocracy to a
democracy without any world-shaking class war.
Russia in truth has moved of late with some
quickness on the road to Liberalism. Less than a
century ago the constitutional position in Russia
was akin to that of England in the time of
William the Conqueror. To-day the political
and social order is more near to that of England
under the Tudors. At the same rate of progress,
with this century Russia will have won to full poli-
tical freedom, and the class struggle will have
spread over far less a space of time than in England
—the typical instance of the comparatively peaceful
development of a democracy. It is true that in
Russia there is still no representative government
and the peasant lacks a vote (though he has
generally a title to a bit of communal land); that
the freedom of the press is restricted ; and that
personal liberty is not assured against the sus-
picion of the bureaucracy. Still there is a system
of local government, and the Senate represents in
some degree the nation ; trial by jury is usual,
even if an occasional political suspect is summarily
dealt with ; and the penal system, which is so
much misrepresented, is, on the whole, far more
merciful, and far more considerate for the weak
than that of Australia. The Government is
autocratic, but yet patornal. A vast and
increasing number of the workers are em-
ployed directly by the State —on the railways,
in the manufacture and distribution of stimulants
and narcotics, in the mining industry, and in
many other State monopolies—and the fact that
the State is to such a large extent the employer
ensures a great body of workers, at least against
the worst miseries of sweating. Education is not
compulsory or general, but it is available in all the
towns, and is being more and more extended. In
short, there is hardly the material of discontent
for a revolution in Russia. The ruling classes
include many men of cruel hearts and swinish
habits, who oppress the poor bitterly, but there
are also many (of whom Tolstoi is an extreme
type) who are keenly alive to the responsibilities
of their trust as landlords. The greatest power
for evil is that of the priestly and military class
—more especially the former. The Greek church
is as strong of secular arm in Russia as the
Anglican establishment was once in England, the
Roman Catholic in Spain and the Presbyterian in
Scotland. And, faithful to the invariable rule
that when priest or parson has political power he
misuses it, the Russian hierarchs by their persecu-
tions and tyrannies are the most formidable forces
working for revolution.
* * * *
It is doubtless because of the evil influence of
the arrogant priests who encircle him and encom-
pass his superstitious soul with dreads, that the
Czar cuts so paltry and recreant a figure at the
present moment. What is most certain of all the
tragic story from Russia is that the autocrat has
proved a poltroon at the first grave call on his
courage. The people cried to him and he went
not. His children called for guidance, and he
handed them over to the flogger, and crept away
to safety. Had he himself wielded the knout and
the sabre he would not have cut so pitiful a figure.
That, indeed, he might have thought his duty as
the light within led him. If he considered his
children misled by evil counsels, chastisement
would be the fitting reply to revolt. But to run
away, and leave the savage reply to another—
that has no excuse. Hardly a monarch in
history has cut so paltry a figure. Had
it so happened even that the worst came, and the
people who clamored for their Little Father took
a mind to kill him (it was most unlikely)—after
all, that was in the game. An autocrat, because
he is an autocrat, must not funk on assassination.
That is part of the price of his power. A
tyrant who is afraid to face the chance of a dagger
is as absurd as a sailor who fears to go to sea.
The poor little Czar —whose weakness is betrayed
in his singular resemblance to the Prince of
Wales —when he fled before the face of his
people, sealed his fate. Safety he has now,
perhaps, and there may be possible for him
in the futui’e a mollusc life behind the thick walls
of fortress palaces—the tool of the bigots and the
ambitious soldiers of the Empire. But he can
never hope to again take any part in the develop-
ment of his people. Such a failure as his has no
remedy.
EDUCATIONAL FADDISM.
“E.J.8.” writes
Mr. Carrutiiers hesitates, Mr. O’Conor hesitates. Mr.
Frederick Bridges, Under-Secretary for N.S.W. Depart-
ment of Education, has been dead for quite an appreciable
while, and his successor is still in nubibus. It has been
announced, more or less authoritatively, that the Premier
is anxious to read the third report of the Education Com-
missioners before making the appointment. This report
is alleged to deal with the large question of technical
education, and is presumed to be almost exclusively from
Mr. J. W. Turner’s pen. Is it that Mr. J. W. Turner is
on his trial, and that his utterances on the side of the
sort of education which is most favored by the Premier,
i.e., the technical, are to make or to mar his chances of
the Under-Seeretaryship ? Mr. Knibbs has largely said
his say, and the see-saw of Ministerial influence favors,
up to date, that clever mathematician. Mr. Turner is evi-
dently' to be judged on his opinions regarding technical
eduction. Yet is technical education of primary concern
to the State ?
* • • •
There is no doubt that Mr. Knibbs has greatly impressed
a large following with his educational views. The
“ Interim Report of the Commissioners,” on primary,
secondary, technical, and other branches of education, is
basically a Knibbsian report; and Mr. Knibbs, from the
end of a distinguished scholarly career, demands from the
child intellect the full measure of his own achievement.
He has roamed over Europe and America, plucking the
curricuplums from many lands, and aspiring to graft
what he considers the best from all systems on to the
Australian educational stock. Professor Haul Pearson,
in a recent article on the London Board School system,
condemns with insistent emphasis the attempt to trans-
plant and impose any system which is not, so to speak,
aboriginal. Particularly is he opposed to the German
curriculum, which, he points out, is a machine of rigid
exactitude, capable of turning out by the score machine-
made men, but only that. The Briton, says Pearson,
cursed by German educational methods of training,
would be about as valuable from a colonising point of
view, as the German is ; and the German is never a
successful coloniser until he follows the Briton’s lead, and
colonises amid a British environment. This is, of course,
only a single aspect of the whole complex question of
national education.
* * * »
Mr. Knibbs is not a practical educator from any primary
educationalist’s point of view. Mr. Turner is. Mr.
Knibbs is an educational experimentalist of an extreme
type. He would teach a child everything which he him-
self knows—and everything else he has read about. To
him the immature brain of the growing boy or girl is a
sort of expanding' gutta-percha tank for the storage of all
human knowledge. He would coerce the play-hour, and
endeavor to impart “useful ” knowledge in the guise of
games. He would thus absolutely lose the value of re-crea-
tion, which should be exactly what its name implies. The
“ Interim Report ” is appalling in the enormity of its cata-
logued educational horrors. Among the things to be im-
parted are kindergarten, manual training and sloyd, draw-
ing, languages, geometry, arithmetic, algebra, music, na-
ture-study, modelling, ethics, physical culture, gymnastics,
history, elementary physics, chemistry, zoology, botany,
geology, mineralogy; and (in addition for the girls)
domestic economy, house-keeping, needle-work, laundry-
work and cookery. As the average boy or girl does not
begin the work of education until about six years of age,
and seldom remains at school after fourteen, one can
easily guess at the imbecility of those who would have
passed through such an educational mill. Mr. Knibbs
deprecates “cramming,” and whenever he speaks on
educational matters he condemns it with considerable
emphasis. Nevertheless, the terrible amount of “ useful ”
information which he, quite unemotionally, presumes
should be grouped under what Macaulay might have
supposed it the duty of “ every schoolboy ” to know,
suggests possibilities of “cram” which might be con-
templated with less of horror if our years were measured
by the orbit of Neptune, and our lives by the Julian
period.
* * * *
Mr. J. W. Turner is said to be a teacher of the old
type, with modern educational attachments. He is a
strong believer in the saving grace of the “humanities”
and the sanity of mathematics ; but he would add thereto
an embroidery of the natural sciences. Of course, all
effective primary education has its root in what has
received the popular designation of the “ three R.’s,”
because there is no possible education worthy of the
name which ignores this essential group. It is the chief
stone of the corner, and it forms the inevitable founda-
tion of all culture. The State owes to every child the
knowledge of the arts of reading and writing and of the
science of arithmetic, and all that acquaintance thereof
implies. But these subjects must be thoroughly taught.
The hours snatched from them to bestow upon plasticine-
modelling, ambidextral drawing, or the building of model
ant-houses are moments wasted. The school-time is so
short; the life to be led afterwards so long in comparison
with that school-time, that educational faddism can have
simply appalling consequences. Moreover, the teachers
who are supposed to teach these primary art-subjects are
mostly themselves ignorant of , or entirely out of sympathy
with them. It would be a sane thing in comparison to
insist upon public school teachers imparting instruction
in the arts of writing epical and lyrical verse, and illus-
trating their instruction by efforts of their own. It is a
curious reflection that in this day of peculiar depreciation
of a literary education, and deification of a bastard art
instruction, the alien test is a literary test. The foreigner
is not called upon to show his skill in brush-work, or in
modelling flowers in plasticine ; but in writing so many
words in a given literary tongue.
* * * *
We are living in an age of machinery. Every day sees
some human agency of craftsmanship superseded by
machinery. The perusal of a book like “ America at
Work” should convince anybody that the day of the
artisan has gone, never to return. The only call upon the
technician is a call on the engineer, on the inventor.
Samuel Butler’s era of machine-rule is all but an accom-
plished fact, and under the trained intellect of a single
man machines beget machines with the prolificness of
rabbits. The industrial evolution of to-day tends towards
the breeding of a few masters of machines and a huge pro-
letariat. And Mr. Oarruthers seizes the moment to
inaugurate a system of technical education. Yet the
average workman can be taught to take his place in the
modern factory in a day, and the knowledge so imparted
will last him for the whole of his natural life.
* « * *
Frederick Harrison, the Positivist, in an essay on
“ Material Civilisation,” has shown that we have advanced
intellectually not one single rood. The very efforts we are
continually making to render educational acquirement a
kind of a dulcet nursery lullaby is proof of this conten-
tion. We strive to teach too much, and we strive to
impart that bolus of information with' too much jam-
cover. The boy or girl who passes through a State school
curriculum comes out of the “ cramming” chamber with
amass of mental all-sorts, fermenting and undigested. Mr.
Carrutiiers has an opportunity, Mr. B. B. O’Conor has an
opportunity, to show by the sanity of their appointment
to the Under-Seeretaryship of Education, their deprecia-
tion of educational faddism and educational “ cram ”;
their relinquishment of the pursuit of impossible ideals
and their adoption of the truly essential and indispens-
able.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Joseph in Recess.
If N.S.W. Premier Carruthers has any sincerity
about him the current recess gives a splendid
opportunity. N.S.W. Parliament rose amid rags
and tatters of economic principles in December
last. It was fagged, worried, addled. Study of
the Estimates began in a scandal and ended in a
fiasco. No man of any party admits they were
properly considered. Yet the Estimates are the
corner-stone of the intelligence and integrity of
government. Here, then, is a chance for Joseph.
The recess will run till about June, and on June
30 the Estimates tor 1904-5 will be a closed book.
The work, good or bad, will have been done and
payment made, and a new financial year will
begin. Premiers, since the days of Donaldson,
have said that the Estimates should be passed by
Parliament before the financial year opens. But
every N.S.W. Premier has left undone what he
should ha ve done. The Estimates Cakkuthers has
taken with him into recess had been half through
their life before Parliament was invited to consider
them. The work, or alleged work, had commenced
in July, and payment had followed, and one-
half the financial burden of the State was beyond
yea or nay when members attacked it. Naturally
many of them said, “ What’s the use of whipping
a half-dead horse ?” Now, early in the recess, is
Careuthers’ chance to set himself the task of an
honest Estimates deal when the House next meets.
If the Departments be properly forewarned,
accounts can be in a state of readiness enabJfhg
the Treasurer to submit the Estimates for 190 u-b
before the beginning of 1905-G. That is all. bo
less would satisfy any man or company in a large
commercial or industrial way. This year Parlia-
ment will meet just in time to reciprocate Joseph s
honest effort, if he will really make it. If he puts on
the table the Estimates for 1905-G before that year
opens he will break fresh ground as a Premier and
make it really possible for Parliament to control
State expenditure.


The Law’s Unfaithful Servant.
Mk. G. H. Reid, denouncing the law in regard to
the mail contracts, whilst faithfully administering
it, does harm only to himself. He shows a curious
inability to understand the responsibilities and
dignities of his office, or to appreciate even the
meaning of “principle” in politics, but causes no
real mischief. The fact that Mr. Reid is opposed
to the law which half-Premier Reid sternly enforces
will not encourage others to break it, for the situa-
tion is such that only Mr. Reid can commit such
a breach, and his persuasiveness will have no effect
upon himself. It is a much more serious matter
when Mr. Wade, the N.S.W. Attorney-General,
gives to one of the Sydney papers an interview in
which he expresses his antagonism to the Arbitra-
tion Act and his conviction that it has “ brokeh
down,” for such an utterance cannot but have the
effect of promoting lawlessness, and puts the sworn
defender of the law in the position of suggesting
and encouraging crime. In the interview, Mr.
Wade is reported to have said
Mr. Wise used to assert that under the new regime such
a thing as a strike would be unknown and impossible,
People who were less sanguine predicted that tVie Act
must break down when a large body of employees, assert-
ing a common grievance, determined not to observe the
orders of the Court. There is no doubt that you cannot
force men to either give employment or to take employ-
ment against their will.
You may enforce the provisions of an Act of Parliament
by levying on the assets of a person who objects, but if
that person has no assets, and the authorities are com-
pelled to fall back on the penal provisions of the Statute,
the time must arrive sooner or later—if there is organised
resistance—when the gaols would be too small, and the
whole administration of justice becomes a laughing stock.
When an Act of Parliament contains penal clauses for
enforcing its objects, and there is failure to enforce them,
that Act is so much waste paper.
Now, apart from all legal quibbles, from saving
excuses of “ifs” and “ans,” there can be no
doubt that the general public will take this to
indicate that Mr. Wade is sure that the Arbitra-
tion Act “must break down,” and that it is “so
much waste paper.” Legal ingenuity may point
to phrases which can perhaps be read as saving
clauses, and argue that Mr. Wade only meant
that if so and so was the case, then the Arbitration
Act was a broken-down failure and mere ink-
spoiled paper. But what legal subtlety can do to
painfully weave into Mr. Wade’s most injudicious
statement some saving merit of caution, cannot
alter the fact that Mr. Wade, Attorney-General,
sworn to administer the laws as they stand,
attacks the Arbitration Act in the press, using
words which, to plain reading, state that he
reckons it to be useless. The effect of such an
attack and such an utterance cannot be otherwise
than harmful, cannot do else than suggest
to aggrieved workmen that the strike’s the
thing, and to aggrieved employers that the
wisdom of going back to the old pre-Arbitration
argument of the lock-out. The Arbitration Act
has just passed through a severe test by the strike
of the Newcastle wheelers (an unorganised, non-
union body not coming directly under its control)
and the consequent enforced idleness of the miners.
After a struggle the Act has triumphed, but not
before the struggle reached the pitch at which it
seemed to the hopeful Tory to represent a defeat
for Arbitration. At this juncture, Mr. Wade,
who not so very long ago took oath to guard
and defend the laws of Parliament, comes
forward in his old ante-Ministerial role of
the paid advocate of the Employers’ Union,
and denounces it as broken-down and useless.
If Mr. Wade is free to do that, Mr. O’Conor
should be free to denounce the secular education
system, and thus give the hint to parson and
priest to move for its destruction ; Mr. Ashton
to declare against the punishment of perjury
before Land Boards; and Mr. Carruthers him-
self to give official countenance to the tote shop.
No one of these things would be as harmful as the
attack on Arbitration by Mr. Wade, for he makes
the subject of his hostility a measure which is
peculiarly dependent upon the loyal support of
the general community for its success. Unless
Premier Carruthers is content to have his Minis-
try acknowledged as hostile to the Arbitration Act,
and as willing to carry its hostility to the point of
exercising it by underhand means, he should
promptly rebuke his subordinate and set the
position of the Ministry straight before the public
eye. If it is the case that the Government is
opposed to the Act, then an open move should be
made for its repeal. To attack it by means of
press interviews, tending to bring it into public
contempt, is treason to the Ministerial responsi-
bility to respect and administer the law as it
stands.
♦
The Stinking-Fish Prime Minister.
The Stinking Fish Party is having a great time.
Something is going to happen to the English
mails, and those daily papers which mostly take
their politics from the importing shopkeeper
speak as though the bottom ivas about to drop out
of Heaven. As a matter of fact, what is going to
happen to the. mails hardly matters two straws.
They are going to arrive in Australia, under contract
with the English G.P.0., with rather more speed
than hitherto; and as the steamers which bring
them have to go bade, and must carry all mails
offered, it is pretty certain that, even under the
proposed poundage system, which all the world
uses, there will not be any delay worth mention-
ing in the outward-going mails. But the Stinking
Fish party saw its chance to tell the world
what a great fool of a place Australia is ;
so it cried on the housetops that the Labor
party had imposed some mad “White Ocean”
conditions which were throwing the whole com-
merce of Australia out of gear. The S. M. Herald
went a bit further, and suggested to Cohen that
it would be a good reason why he should make us
pay a bit more for renewal ioans. And now, in
the midst of all this crying of stinking fish, this
cursing of the Labor party, this holding up of the
“ White Ocean ” policy to execration, ex-Premier
Watson quietly exposes the whole web of shame-
less and unpatriotic mendacity :
In Mr. Reid’s own department is a letter from Mr.
Anderson, Australian manager of the Orient Pacific line,
addressed to Mr. Dbakin while Prime Minister, in which
it is stated that the question of employing' white labor
had no material bearing on the price asked for the renewal
of the contract. While in office I had an interview with
Mr. Anderson, when he again repeated that it was not a
question of which class of labor should be employed, but
solely one of allowing his company to escape a repetition
of the loss involved in the contract then existing. He
further stated that the cost of colored labor was approxi-
mately the same as that of white, as the company had to
employ two colored men to do the work of one white man,
with a corresponding increase in the accommodation set
apart for the stokers. I gave the substance of that inter-
view to Parliament and the press at the time, and quoted
the statement contained in the letter to Mr. Oka kin, so
there is no excuse for Mr. Reid, or indeed any other
leader of public opinion, being ignorant of the true
position.
And Mr. Anderson writes thereupon to the daily
pipers admitting that he said all these things.
Probably there is on record no more brazen
attempt to fasten unpopularity on to a political
party; there c-rvtainly has been no more un-
gitriotic attempt; and, appropriately enough, Mr.
. H. PeiD is responsible.
The Brand on the Butter.
Victoria after chuckling for months over the
monotonous revelations of its Butter Commission,
as though the long-drawn-out scandal were a
blessing to the country, is now beginning to under-
stand that the management of the inquiry into
the butter export trade has been directly injurious
to the producers on whose behalf it was instituted.
In blackening the character of the trade, the
Commission besmirched the reputation of the
goods—-or, rather, it offered an easy chance for
rival exporters to do so. An odor of scandal
attaches to Vic. butter shipments on the English
market. The tip-tilted nose of foreign competi-
tion greets them with scornful sniffs, and the
price of the disparaged article declines as its
quality improves. Victorian butter was never
before so good as it now is. But a bad name
has been given to good stuff. The packing-
cases stink of the middleman’s dishonesty owing
to the fact that the official inquiry m Mel-
bourne has been practically restricted to the task
of fouling those packing - cases with noisome
revelations of fraud, instead of being devoted to a
business-like setting forth of the disease, its
causes, and how it can be cured. As a matter of
fact, the middleman’s power over the Vic. butter
trade arose from the weakness of the competing
factories, dotted all around the country under the
management of men whose paltry salaries of 355. a
week or so, left them at the tempter’s mercy. The
producers have been maintaining five times as
many factories as are necessary to the trade, and
in this multiplicity of factories they have suffered
a double loss. Firstly, the working expenses of a
little place with an underpaid manager are pro-
portionately greater, by far, than the exes, of a
big placed controlled by a man who can afford
to be honest. Secondly, the underpaid person,
whilst making “a bit for himself,” plays into the
hands of the rapacious agent who robs the
producers on a wholesale system. The
iniquities of the Vic. butter trade, as revealed
by witnesses at the Melbourne enquiry, were
nothing to be. astonished at under the circum-
stances, yet solicitor Croker, the examiner-in-
chief, has been eternally harping on the one old
string of commercial dishonesty, until the outside
public felt persuaded that butter was the source
of original sin, and that Beelzebub was weaned
on it. A lot of time wasted in superfluous discussion
concerning rather inferior butter and very bad but-
termen might have been more profitably employed
in letting everybody hear, mark and understand
that the Poor Farmer has only had himself to
blame for the leakage in his dairy profits, and the
disastrous scandal arising therefrom. A simple
remedy lies in the farmer’s own stupid hands.
The experience of Denmark, Ireland, and every
dairying country teaches the need for proper co-
operation, in place of a feeble misapplication of
the system. With effective co-operation on
a sufficient capital, and an assured minimum
output of butter, the farmer is not robbed
at every turn hy agents and other middle-
men. He gets full value for his butter at
a minimum cost of placing it. The N.S.W.
Government witnesses, whom Woolf sum-
moned to the Commission, made it clear that a co-_
operative butter co. should have a capital of
£10,030, with £5OOO paid up, and a guaranteed
output of 200 to 250 tons per annum. To get this
result the little cut-throat co-operative companies
languishing throughout Victoria should at once
amalgamate within their district limitations.
Ultimately they should amalgamate into one big
central concern, having its own selling represen-
tatives in Melbourne, London, and S’Africa, and
wherever Vic. butter can find a considerable
market. Meanwhile, there is nothing to be
gained by blackguarding the middleman. The
only way of protecting a trade against the middle-
man is to take it out of his hands.
♦
The Two N.S.W. Strikes.
Both the strikes with which the New Year
opened in N.S.W. have ended. The wool-buyers
were entirely successful in their stand against the
shipping companies, and so, naturally, returned
to work. The coal-wheelers have had to give way
on all points, and go back to the pits on the
masters’ terms. The different results illustrate
again the fact that often might is right. Com-
paring the two cases, the wheelers had a greater
grievance and a more serious loss than the wool-
buyers ; but their trades-union organisation
was less effective and their resources poorer. So
they failed and the wool-buyers succeeded. The
peace which now reigns in the coal-trade is of the
sort that was once proclaimed at Warsaw;
the wheelers have sullenly submitted, but they are
not satisfied, and discontent also affects the miners.
A strenuous effort should be made to alleviate at
once that discontent by hurrying on the hearing
before the Arbitration Court of the case which is
to determine the conditions of the Northern coal
industry. Of course the Arbitration Court
cannot remedy the depression in the coal
trade. A remedy for that can only come
from such wise legislation as will foster
local industries—especially the iron industry
—and relieve the colliery proprietors of the
necessity of depending so much on the foreign
market. If N.S. W. Premier Carruthers had any
statesmanship, he could—independently of the
Federal Parliament, which has control of most
matters affecting trade and industry—give the
coal business a big fillip by helping the foundation
of local iron works. The guarantee of a certain
amount of State business at a fair price would
start the iron hammers ringing in N.S.W. to-
morrow, and push ahead the coal and many
another industry.
♦— —
The Coal-Mining Industry.
“As a guide to the extent of the dislocation of
trade caused by the strike,” the Sydney Tele-
graph remarks, “it may be mentioned that the
export of coal from Newcastle last week was only
about a third below that of the recent normal
weekly output.” There were, roughly, 3300
miners idle, besides 1000 other hands, including
wheelers; yet, working in some cases less than
full time, the half of the mines that have not been
idle supplied two-thirds of the normal export.
The other one-third wasn’t necessarily trade lost
to N.S. Wales; some of it went to the Southern
collieries, whose capacity is far in excess of
their present output, while most of the rest
sat down and waited. The people who
are eternally telling us to go and develop
our natural resources ought to reckon up what
this means —that New South Wales has developed
about the greatest of its natural resources so far
ahead of the real requirements of the case that
at a time when nearly half of the workmen
were loafing around, the other half could supply
two-thirds of the trade without bustling. Also,
it means that, when rather more than half of the
principal mines at Newcastle were closed, the other
half could, without much inconvenience and on
very short notice, supply the whole of the present
demand, even without the help of the large coal
measures which are being developed out towards
Maitland. These are facts which will come
in handy when next the conctssion-grabbers
make a move to get hold of areas under the
Sydney water-catchment, ostensibly to mine
for coal. Admitting the coal is there, what
has happened during this strike proves (what, no
doubt, was obvious enough to the unprejudiced
already) that there is no need whatever to work
it. And, considering how enormously ahead of
the demand the supply at Newcastle and the
Southern collieries has been developed, it seems
highly probable that it wouldn’t even be proposed
to mine under the catchment if it weren’t the
catchment. For, if there is no money in mining
there, there is money in getting a footing there,
and thus endangering the metropolitan water
supply. Nobody pays the organ-grinder for his
noise, and no intelligent organ-grinder expects it;
but he gets paid, all the same; and the deadlier
the machine, the readier comes the victim’s three-
pence. Once speculators are allowed a footing on
this catchment, so appalling will be the possible
consequences from the inevitable pollution that,
especially in some time of scare, the public will be
prepared to pay any price that the brigands
choose to name to get rid of them. In the
public interest, there is obviously no need
for them ; there is not one single reason why
they should be given a footing. On the
other hand there are 514,000 people in Sydney,
and every one of them is a conclusive reason why
the water-catchment should be held sacred from
the men who want to endanger it.
Tasmanian “Economy.”
Tasmania is nearer to indignation with its Govern-
ment now than for many a month. The reason is
the action of the Evans Ministry regarding two
recent wrecks on the south-west coast of the island.
A few months ago, the Acacia sailed from Hobart,
sighted Maatsuyker lighthouse, and was never
heard of again. After much agitation, the
Government made arrangements for an inexpensive
cursory examination of a few miles of coast. No
wreckage was found. A few weeks later, a corpse
was reported by some fishermen to be lying, clothed
in unbushmanlike garments and tan boots, between
the uninhabited Port Davey district and the Huon
settlements. Nothing was done for several days.
Then the police went out, buried the body,
and no further search was made. Shortly after,
the Brier Holme, overdue from London, was
exciting discussion. On the excuse of economy
the Government did nothing. On New Year’s
Day, two fishermen, holidaying to Port Davey,
saw articles soon identified as Brier Holme cargo
strewn along the strand. Economy was still
urged by the Government as an excuse for doing
nothing. Tasmania is slow to show feeling, but
feeling did rise after a while. Still the Govern-
ment dallied until private individuals in Launces-
ton guaranteed £lOO towards the cost of a search.
Then, after ten days’ delay, a 24-ton steamer was
sent out with a party which contained not one
bushman or person acquainted with the country
back of Port Davev. After four days the search
party returned. Nearly half the time spent in the
neighborhood of Port Davey had been lost because
the vessel was too small to brave bad weather, and
had to remain in shelter. One body was found,
evidently not very long dead. Also a deserted
camp was seen, with marks of sharp-toed boots, a
few empty bloater and meat tins, and other signs
of a town man’s recent presence; but no extensive
search was made, as the party contained no one fit
to go far into the bush. One of the searchers
admits that when the boat was close to shore
at a certain spot, a collie dog ran down to
the shore line, barked excitedly at the boat,
and dashed into the bush, again emerging
and repeating his performance. There are no
habitations from which he could have strayed,
and no wild dogs or dingoes in Tasmania, yet, in-
credible as it seems, no attempt was made tci land
there, nor any search made to find the reason of
the collie’s behavior. In response to wild in-
dignation another search party was despatched,
after three days more had elapsed, in the same 24-
ton cockleshell, and other parties set out overland,
these letter at private expense. .Tasmania shows
a disposition to refuse to put up with this sort of
thing. And rightly. The little country is dog-
poor owing to the financial mismanagement of the
past, but it still has some pretence of being a civi-
lised country capable of rescuing or attempting to
rescue a mariner wrecked on its shores. If Tas-
mania is too poor to do that, it should go out of the
business of being a State.

“ L.” writes :
Re “ The Lack of an Effective Savage ” (19/l/’O5), the
real trouble is that we constitute a dependency (self-
governing, but a dependency none the less) of Great
Britain. Our national sentiment is neither one thing nor
the other. We are educated at school, in the press, and
on the stage, as if we were born and bred in England.
Our patriotism is to uphold the Empire and consider the
black coolie as our brother. Our national affairs lack the
note of seriousness, and never call forth any national
feeling. Had we to defend ourselves at home and main-
tain our prestige abroad at the courts of foreign powers,
it would mean a great difference to us. At present we
are tied to the apron-strings of Mama England, who
wants us only for the sake of the goods she can dump
down on our shores and the dividends she can gather
from the concerns into which she has put her capital.
The blight of England and Australia alike is “ the
Empire ” ; and the only remedy is imperial dis-
integration. The Empire does not exist for the
benefit of the English people, 13,000,000 of whom are
“starving or on the verge of starvation,” but for the
privileged few. Although the wealth and territory of
England’s Empire have been increasing every year, the
poverty and degradation of the people have also been
increasing. The physique of the English people has
deteriorated ; and lunacy is largely on the increase ; while
56i>ercent. of the children of the “ lower classes ” die before
the age of five. Australia, too, is suffering from this
British Empire, impossible to-day as was the old Roman
Empire of days gone by. The most blatantly patriotic, or
imperialistic, section of the community' is to be found
amongst the Freetraders, who block the development of
Australian industries, the establishment of an Australian
navy, the maintenance of a White Australia, etc. There
are two things to choose between—the consolidation of
the British Empire, and its disintegration. The only hope
for Australia is to choose the latter and to mark out a
deliberate policy towards independence and the estab-
lishment of an Australian Republic. That we cannot
defend ourselves is one of those bogies which imperialists
have created to frighten us. But, when examined, it
will be found quite harmless. We can have only one indivi-
sible, and coherent national sentiment ; and that one is for
the land of our birth, and the kind of civilisation we have
developed, to live in accordance with local conditions. If
we try at the same time to be “ loyal” to England or the
Empire, the result will be a m ngrel national sentiment
that will be worthless for any purpose at all. Only
hoping for and striving after an Australian Republic will
impart into the conduct of our affairs the note of seri-
ousness. With such an ideal before the people of the
Commonwealth, the payment of naval tribute, the
absence of an effective protective tariff, and similar
things would be impossible. We want to be a self-
contained, self-reliant nation, with a national form of
government. And that is what separation and the
establishment of an Australian Republic would speedily
bring about.

Thus “ Yankee Doodle ”
There is an eternal crying out for cutting up big estates
to settle people on the land. There it ends —all talk.
The simplest, quickest and most beneficial way out of the
difficulty (no borrowing required ; no injury to the land-
holder) would be to have a labor clause as regards land on
similar lines to that relating to mining properties.
Classify land into, say, three divisions —good, medium,
and poor. First-class land to carry one man to every
(say) 400 acres ; second-class, one to every 700 acres ; and
third-class, one to every 1000 acres. Take a property of
21,000 acres classified as second-class : thus in place of
employing a man and two dogs, 30 men would be re-
quired, and with land men can always be employed
profitably. Then we would see plenty of employment,
also a better return for the landholder, as with a little
cultivation there would be twice the stock carried. There
is a fair opening for the Labor party to introduce and
push such a measure as this, and clo good to all concerned.
The idea has a certain radiance about it, but,
as it happens, it isn’t this country’s ambition to
see the great squire with 300,000 acres bossing 750
agricultural laborers, who would gradually acquire
habits of servility and hat-touching, while their
daughters learned the bob-curtsey. A closely
settled land of small, independent farmers is the
thing aimed at —not a closely settled land of hired
serfs or human caterpillars, or anything of that
sort. “Yankee Doodle’s” assurance that his
scheme would do no harm to the big landowner
damns it. It is necessary to do harm to the big
landowner.
—♦■ '
Thus “A.W.” in the Wesminster Review on
the introduction of Chinese to South Africa: —•
Persistence in the present mad course simply means the
loss of South Africa —possibly the loss of the whole of our
Colonial Empire. Already the Chinese Government is
endeavoring to use the Slavery Ordinance as a lever to
force Australia, Maoriland and Canada to admit Chinese
labor. And the spirit in which this will be met is the
spirit which animated the Cape Colonists when, in 1849,
they successfully resisted the landing of convicts on their
shores ; the spirit which led Henry Parkes, when. Premier
of New South Wales, to warn Lord Salisbury, when he
remonstrated against the colony refusing admission to, or
penalising, Chinese immigrants— .
“ Neither for her Majesty’s ships of war, nor for her
Majesty’s representatives on the spot, nor for her
Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, do we intend
to turn aside from our purpose.”
Which led him, when charged with breaking the law,
to reply'— , .
“ I care nothing for your cobweb of technical law. lam
obeying a law far superior to any law which issued these
permits (to Chinamen), namel.v, the law of the preserva-
tion of society in New South Wales.”
That spirit the Government will rouse at its peril.

From a Vic. country school-teacher :
Director Frank Tate, of the Victorian Education De-
partment, has made a good start with the Continuation
School, which “ Bleeds ” Fitchett so abhors, by choosing
Joseph Hocking, one of the youngest of the inspectors,
but an enthusiastic educationist, as Acting-Principal.
Tate picks his men from anywhere, looking only' to their
fitness, which accounts in a great measure for his success.
At the back of the enthusiastic and permanently'
youthful Director is a long line of comparatively
young men ; and this force has completely broken
up the Conservative clique that used to dawdle along
anyhow under the shadow of the Treasury' Buildings.
But the Continuation School may have an effect on the
teaching staff that Tate will tear his hair over later on.
From the Training College it is but a step to the Univer-
sity, and the brightest of the students, finding other and
more promising careers open, will hustle for other pro
fessions, to dodge the awfulness of teaching - 30 cookies
kids in a galvanised iron school. -The spectacle of a
scholar and a student, set among - st these people, to live
and marry and die between the minimum £l6O and the
maximum £2OO per annum, is awful to contemplate. The
endless round of petty detail, the marking time, the rush to
the annual exam., the beginning - of the same weary round
over again—these nave driven more brainy men to drink
than the Department knows. To finish this way will not be
the ambition of the choice brains that Tate will train. The
Education Bill, which was shelved last session in order to
make room for some log-rolling measures, provides for a
system of promotion based on merit alone. But that is
scarcely sufficient, for the salaries (with a few exceptions)
are ridiculously low. In the range of their study, the
teachers are, on an average, the best educated men in the
community' ; and as specialists in their own line they
compare well with specialists in other lines. -To become
the highest qualified teacher in the Department requires
as much work and training as to become a doctor or a
barrister ; and yet compare the incomes ! So, if Tate
wants to keep his excellent students, the salary scale will
have to be amended, and every position will have to be
open to the fittest man.
The Little Czar.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, wan Wliite C/.ar of Russia, who hid your face
and ran,
You’ve flung afar the grandest chance that ever
came to man !
You might have been, and could have been—ah,
think it to your shame !
The Czar of all the Russias, in fact as well as
name.
'*■ The Father of your People ” your children called
to you
To do the the things to save them which only you
could do.
Your soldiers whipped their faces—the trodden
snow is red
With the blood of men and women—and the blood
is on your head. „
I saw in dreams a monarch—of his pomp all un-
aware—
Step down amongst his people from off his palace
stair:
The Grand Dukes shrank and trembled, the
traitors fled afar—
Through all the mighty Russias rang the greeting
for the Czar !
You might have journeyed freely, wherever path
is made,
Through all your vast dominions, alone and un-
afraid ;
And, in the eyes of subjects, the cultured and the
rude,
Have seen, instead of hatred, the tears of grati-
tude.
Oh, little Czar of Russia, a weak man and a fool.
At the mercy of your nobles—their prisoner and a
tool.
Your freedom and your people’s and their love
was to be won—
Ah, me ! it would have been a deed a coward
might have done.
Yet we who know so little might say one word for
you—
How many in our weakness have lost our king-
doms, too!
And, facing death and exile, when all the world
seemed black,
How many in our after-strength have won our
kingdoms back !

When Carrie Swain came to Australia in
Dec., ’86, and started a prosperous “starring”
engagement as “The Tomboy,” she was under-
stood to be the newly-wedded wife of her business
manager, Frank Gardner, and it was her money,
presumably, that made a mining speculator of him.
“ Mr.” Carrie Swain (as The Bulletin then called
him) had the luck to run against the Broken Hill
boom. He bought into the parent mine at a low
price, it is said, and lie bought shares in the
“ pups,” and presently he blossomed into Frank
Gardner, Esq., husband of Miss Carrie Swain,
formerly of the stage. Sydney remembers them in
those after years as a pair of imposingly apparelled
citizens lolling behind a pair of showy horses in
a blue and yellow barouche. Even in theatrical
circles, where the word of an alleged husband and
wife is rarely considered as good as their matri-
monial bond—even among the pros, the Gardners’
alliance was unquestioned. The present law-suit
reminds one of the famous Boucicault scandal.
Old Dion Boucicault, the dramatist and actor,
after recognising Mrs. Boucicault as his wife for
30 years, astonished the world by going through a
form of, marriage with the beauteous Louise Thorn-
dyke during his visit to Australia in 1885. He,
like Gardner, denied the validity of his American
marriage ceremony of long ago, but the original
Mrs. Boucicault promptly re-asserted her claim to
the title. Carrie Swain, in her appeal to the
court, admits that Gardner declared himself free
of her as long ago as 1901; therefore her legal
action looks to have been unwisely delayed.
* * # *
The late William Henry Rignold was born
at Leicester in December, 1836, of an acting
family—-at all events, on the mother’s side—and
began his stage career in early boyhood as a dancer
and pantomimist. Afterwards he studied music
under the father of George Coppin. Like his
younger brother, George, he was a violinist for
about seven years, and during the latter portion
of that time was leader of the orchestra.
In 1856, however, he got a chance to play
Rashleigh in “Rob Roy,” and from that out
forsook music for the drama. His principal Eng-
lish successes were achieved as Jacques in “ The
Two Orphans ” at the Olympic in 1874 ; in 1879,
as Goujet, at the Princess’, to the Coupeau of
Warner, in “Drink”; as Macbeth to the Lady
Macbeth of Mme. Ristori, in 1882 ; and in various
Shakspearean characters, in support of Mary
Anderson, in 1884. His last big English success
was as John Saxton, the Yorkshire squire, in
“ Now-a-Days,” and he came out to Australia,
early in 1890, chiefly to play the character. He
was accompanied by his eldest daughter, Bessie,
who here married Guyton Heath — George
Rignold’s assistant stage - manager. William
Rignold in Sydney also took part in pro-
ductions of “ After Dark,” “ The Two Orphans,”
“ The Long Strike,” “ Forty-Nine,” “ The Lyons
Mail,” “Youth,” “The Lights of London” (as
the old showman), “Flying from Justice,” “The
Merry Wives of Windsor,” and other plays. His
greatest success here was as Falstaff, in “The
Merry Wives.” A giant in stature, rich-voiced,
handsome, open-eyed, and naturally of a jolly,
free, and genial disposition, he was built by
nature for the character, and nothing finer in its
way can be imagined. The hot-headed, warm-
hearted, and kindly player passed away in his
sleep—an end not unexpected. He had been
totally blind during the last five years of his life,
and was sustained during his latter days chiefly
by the result of a benefit, given to him in 1903,
which realised £1581. It will be remembered that
his second daughter (Dora) played Oberon and
Viola with Musgrove’s Shakspearean co. a year
or so ago. His youngest daughter (Marie) is
now on her way to Australia with Van Biene’s
“ Broken Melody ” co.

A correspondent:—
The Sydney Building Surveyor and the City Council
seem to be completely in the wrong as regards at least
one of the Sydney theatres. The difference between
leases and licenses does not seem to have been appre-
hended, and some very damaging statements were made
concerning the Lyceum Theatre, whose lessee, it was de-
clared, had done nothing “ to carry out certain suggested
alterations.” NowtheGovernment, earlyin 1904,appointed
a Theatre Committee which included two under-secre-
taries, the Superintendent of the Fire Brigade, the Town
Clerk, and some others. Mr. George Musgrove has
already spent some hundreds of pounds at the Lyceum in
carrying out their recommendations, and has had plans
prepared—now under consideration by the Theatres
Committee—for some structural alterations suggested,
which would cost thousands of pounds to carry out.
* * *
“L.B.”: It is scandalous that, while the
people of Australia spend every year some hun-
dreds of thousands on theatrical amusements,
hardly a penny of this money goes into the pocket
of an Australian dramatic author. From the
purely material point of view, it is as bad for us
not to have a local play-writing profession as a
local bootmaking or piano-making industry. The
business men who run our theatres can’t be
bothered with local playwrights. It is too much
worry to have to read manuscripts and select
suitable plays; too much worry to work out the
staging in all its details. It is found much sim-
pler to pay a thousand pounds for the Austral-
asian rights of a piece which has already been
successfully produced in London or New York.
Not only is the play itself imported, but the
scenery, costumes, properties, and posters. Thus,
not only are local dramatists deprived of an
opportunity of following up their profession, but
local costumiers, artists, and printers lose a lot of
work which they should have. Simply as a matter
of finding employment for our own people, the
absence of an Australian drama is a serious affair.
Not only this, but the growth of a genuine
national sentiment is retarded. The drama, from
the national and democratic standpoint, is the
greatest of all the arts. By its very nature,
it is meant for the people, to amuse
them and to reflect their own life. Aus-
tralia, always steadily imitating England,
has a great need of a national drama—that is, a
drama true to our social ideas and to our national
sentiment. At the present time our social ideas
are either hybrid or altogether unhealthy, simply
because we try to be “so very English, don’t you
know,” when all the while we are really Australian.
We want more national pride. Australia is, in its
way—and that is an altogether different way —as
good and as beautiful a country as England. We
have made a good start to rid ourselves of those
degraded social ideas which make one class of the
English people a set of supercilious privileged
loafers and another large section toadies
and flunkeys and people who, in that vile
English phrase, “know their place.” Despite
a narrow fringe of so-called “ Society people,”
Australia is happily free from the snobbery on the
one hand and the servility on the other, which are
such marked characteristics of English life. The
drama “holds the mirror up to Nature,” and
nearly every English play has a lord or a duke in
it, or else a country gentleman. A great many
English plays turn on some class distinction,
which means little or nothing for Australia. It is
only natural that the English drama should reflect
English social ideas and caste privileges, all of
which are alien to our manner of life. It is asking
too much of us to have them continually obtruded
on our stage. We have the material for a highly
original and interesting drama in Australia, a
drama which will be founded rather on the reali-
ties of human nature, than the flimsy devices of the
theatrical hacks, whose business it is to pander to
the tastes of the “smart set,” with which England
to-day is burdened.

Bland Holt, at Sydney Royal, gets another
kick out of the Boer war and the Jingo business,
through “ The Best of Friends.” A Kruger-like
person makes an early appearance, and talks
about war and secret preparations for war. “ Dr.
Jim,” of course, isn’t mentioned, neither is
the Raid—in the light of what happened
afterwards, about the most ludicrous thing
in history. Neither is Ah Sin in the piece.
When “The Best of Friends” was written Ah
Sin hadn’t appeared on the scene, and the gallery
didn’t know that one of the things the Dopper in
the rusty black clothes was fighting for was work for
the white miner. The gallery yelled senseless
Jingo songs when the foreign-Jew wire pullers told
it that the Boer was a person who was denying poli-
tical rights to the poor crushed Outlander (who was
drawing about £8,000,000 a year in dividends); now
when the Boer has been killed and his farm-house
burned, the gallery finds that the Outlander hasn’t
as much political power as he had before, but
has Ah Sin instead. “The Best of Friends,” in
fact, wants revising. It isn’t a bad dramatic
story, but it perpetuates viciously wrong ideas
about a matter which it isn’t desirable there
should be any wrong ideas about. Ignorance and
prejudice (both of which it fosters) have done
too much harm to S’Africa and “the Empire”
already. If this is forgiven in the piece, and it
is accepted as a piece of reckless romance, it’s all
right. One thing in its favor: it doesn’t throw
mud at the old Kruger-like person. He stands
out (though he’s a minor actor in the drama) as
the finest character of all. The mounting
is, of course, as gorgeous as Bland Holt and
Brunton can make it; and the story lends itself
to gorgeous trimming. Everybody takes the
parts everybody would expect them to take. Holt
makes his entry in abbreviated sea-weed breeches
as Father Neptune. He is a circus performer,
and makes much fun. Miss Ross is a circus-rider
who, a duke or something having fallen in love with
her, has to turn out to be a princess or some-
thing without her knowledge. The piece illus-
trates how easily you can be any sort of an here-
ditary legislator in England ; and that is another
thing in its favor at a moment when the Tory
papers are asking in a shocked way by what right
the Czar governs Russia. Full of action, “The
Best of Friends” is certainly popular; and on
Anniversary night the theatre overflowed long
before the clock struck eight.

The poetical pirates and well-intentioned
men of blue who figure in “The Pirates of Pen-
zance,” made a brave re-appearance at Her
Majesty’s, presenting effectively Gilbert’s satire
and Sullivan’s harmony. “The Pirates of Pen-
zance ” indeed promises to be the best all-round
production of the Gilbert and Sullivan revivals.
There are fewer deficiencies in the rendering of
Sullivan’s music than in the two preceding operas.
Also in one or two instances the principals are not
so marionette-like when it was no intention of
Gilbert that they should be. Miss Alexia
Bassian makes a much more agreeable Mabel
than a Josephine. The company of courteous,
retired noblemen masquerading as pirates,
and of unhappy policemen with their “hearts
in their boots,” is apparently more congenial
than horn - piping sailors, who are apt
to make one look a bit stiff when comporting
oneself as in dignified and stately Italian opera.
Miss Bassian is, in short, a.charming Mabel, and
when she warbles her waltz song she becomes
fascinating to more individuals than that craven
“ slave of duty,” Frederick, who occupies valuable
time in working out vain riddles concerning Leap
Year, and his exact position in relation to the
piratical world. Frederick,. as impersonated by
Mr. Walter White, is a vocal acquisition to the
principals. He is a young tenor with a lusty,
growing voice which has not to glide into falsetto
for top noteSj and he has a future if he is careful.
Miss Ghiloni is a buxom and tuneful Ruth, and
Mr. Frank Wilson, as the Pirate King, is of the
proper rollicking and jovial stamp, with a good
lieutenant in Mr. John Ralston. Mr. Howard
Vernon naturally is perfectly happy as the Major-
General —as garrulous and pattering a sham as
Admiral Porter, K.C.B.- —while Mr. Ernest
Fitts, the police-sergeant, ably leads his men to
possible death and glory with a loud voice and the
assistance of the bassoon. Altogether pirates and
policemen and daintily-dressed maidens are a
melodious, merry set, and make Her Majesty’s a
bright spot now of nights.

As the paperhanger and the plumber are
waiting to play an expensive season under George
Musgrove’s management at the Lyceum, the
Nellie Stewart season is being bustled through,
and “Blind Man’s Buff” is to be followed on
Saturday by “ Old Heidelberg,” a dramatic tale of
an hereditary princeling who takes himself very
seriously, and a pretty girl (who is Nellie Stewart),
and many students, and much lager beer. “ Blind
Man’s Buff ” had a fine and merry holiday house ;
and one part, which bulks large in the play,
but wasn’t mentioned last week, is mentioned
now because the holiday house got most fun
out of it. This is the ridiculous old lady who
struggles to float into “ society ” on the joint
savings of her two dead pork-butchering husbands.
There are half-a-dozen excellent character studies
in “Blind Man’s Buff,” but this one is poor
because it is so exaggerated. But thereby perhaps
hangs a tale. The theatrical manager knows
what parts of the house he has to look to for the
success of this sort of piece, and he thinks twice
before he too faithfully presents the besetting sin
of the people who leave most money at the box
office. So, possibly, the awful struggle to get into
“ society ” is deliberately and ridiculously over-
done so that even the worst straggler in d.c. or
orchestra stalls may laugh with the rest of them,
and never dream that she’s being made fun of.
Anyway it’s the one leading part which isn’t
approximately real, in a play far ahead of the
average melodrama.

Prior to her departure for Europe, Miss
Neo Theakstone, an Australian musician, gave a
concert in Sydney last week, which was made up
entirely of her own compositions. It is not good
to encourage mediocre musical artists to leave us
for London. They do not set the Thames aflame,
and many come sadly to grief. But, to judge from
the compositions presented at her concert, Miss
Theakstone is somewhat of an exception. Though
she only had amateurs to interpret her songs, the
works were decidedly melodious and had touches
of originality, indicating something in re-
serve. Her piano pieces, also, had a catching
ring. Miss Theakstone has been content not
to aim at too high a standard, and in most
instances has fairly succeeded. Many of her
compositions are well worthy of publication ;
and in this connection it will be manifestly to her
interest to be nearer the world’s great artistic and
commercial centre. At her concert the young
composer had a large audience of admiring friends,
who applauded each item to the echo ; but that sort
of thing of course really counts for nothing. Many a
colonial musical student, on proceeding to London,
goes to the expense of having a concert at St.
James’s Hall, attended by numerous invited
friends. The success of the entertainment is at
once cabled to Australia, but it often repre-
sents the beginning and the end of the misguided
aspirant to fame.

Sydney Tivoli added two new and attrac-
tive turn* to its programme last week. Bonita
(“the child of the plains”) is an attractive
girl who can shoot anything from anywhere
with any sort of gun, and she seems to
have stepped straight out of a “Deadwood
Dick” novel. Cleopatra, the other new-comer,
enchants audiences, alligators and serpents, toys
with the ungentle python, and takes liberties
with the sobbing crocodile. These, with many
other good turns, make the Tivoli a pleasant
variety house just now.

A happy idea, that of sandwiching “Romeo
and Juliet ” between the respective productions of
“ L’Aiglon ” and “ Camille” (latter begins Satur-
day, February 4th) ! The passionate, primitive
tragedy of romantic Romeo and his ardent Juliet,
hearty young things who, only for poison and
knife, might have lived to 90, is in whole-
some contrast to the consumptive delusions
of Rostand’s hysterical Napoleon boy and
Dumas’ hectic lady of the camelias. Miss
Tittell Brune, whose Juliet is otherwise pleasing,
is, spectacularly speaking, not impressive. Fine
clothes, worn by her, fall short of the possible
effect, and in stately dance or similar stage
pageant, she fails to hold her own as.the principal
figure. The old Capulet of current production is
more than ordinarily choleric, and nightly, after
his angry scene with his daughter, an offended
rustle audibly sizzes through the gallery-crowd of
suburban girls, testifying to Young Australia’s
disapproval of Old Italy’s heavy father.

There were more patrons than seats at
Melb. Bijou on Saturday, Jan. 28, when “East
Lynne ” was revived. The hot weather, in con-
junction with the mournful stage-happenings,
steeped the crowd in perspiration ? and tears.
“East Lynne,” judged by Saturday’s reception,
has not yet reached the dregs of its power to draw
a good house. A large section of theatregoers
seemingly love the venerable weep. First night
the audience refused to take the villain, as inter-
preted by H. O. Willard, seriously. Whenever ht
strolled into view, with a bunch of rorty black
ribbons bound to his supercilious eyeglass,* he was
received with good-humored laughter. But this
frivolity manifested no tendency to cast off the
spell of “East Lynne” en masse , for, later on,
Mdme. Vine and “ little Willie” drew tears just
as plentifully as of old.
* * * *
Vivian Edwards is a young, handsome,
well-set-up Archibald Carlyle. H. 0. Willard
presents bad baronet Levison in too casual and
trifling a style. A long course of meaningless
histrionic villainy, enacted amid absurd stage
situations, where everything is so unlikely that an
actor would waste pains in trying to be convincing,
has set its seal, maybe, on the deportment of
Willard. “ East Lynne ” has enough method in
its madness to demand less resigned nonchalance
of mien, from the Serpent in its Paradise. Miss
Lillie Bryer brings out the crisp points of Miss
Carlyle. Ida Gresham is a pleasing Bar-
bara Hare. Hilda Fraser does good work
as the faithful maid. Little Elsa Landquest,
as Willie, is an ideal stage-child, a deco-
rative blonde, with long, sunny curls. Eugenie
Duggan, as Lady Isabel, alias Mdme.
Vine, is seen to advantage in several effective
toilettes. Otherwise, her Lady Isabel gives the
idea of a “sweet ” sort of person, too much given
to a sobbing style of address. Miss Duggan is
another victim of a long course of melodramatic
woe. The ‘ ‘ East Lynne ’ ’ railway-smash is a com-
mendable effect, and the piece, as a whole, is well-
mounted and staged.

If arrangements, announced at time of
writing, are adhered to, to-night (Feb. 2) wit-
nesses Hackenschmidt’s final muscle-display at
the Opera House. Delroy and Bell, Kearns and
Rosslyn, also Gregson and Goodfellow, are still to
the fore, besides (among others) Irving Sayles,
Tom Dawson, and Carden Wilson, who imitates
Brough very well and Julius Knight rather badly.
Prince’s Court, which keeps the ball rolling by
means of toboggan races and similar novelties,
ranks in the religion of local children as anew
Heaven on earth.

“ Sinbad,” having got its second wind and
anew supply of items, is going as strong as ever
at the Melb. Royal. Thanks to the topical
song, “If Captain Cook had never come here,”
young Australia awakes to the fact that Nelson,
Wellington, and “good Queen Victoria” are not
the only back-numbers worth remembering. It is
something to be thankful for that we’re not all
still shivering in the Cold Country.

At Her Majesty’s (Melbourne), “ The
Geisha,” which was advertised beforehand as
“ the great Japanese revival ”(“ revivals ” are the
thing just now, vide Wales with its 70,000 re-
vivalists), gives place on Saturday (February 4) to
“Paul Jones,” the final production of present
comic opera season. The Jap attraction has
not proved so potent a draw as was hoped.
The public to-day, knowing there’s not a kick left
in its old victim, the “Jew-ellof Ay-shur,” demands
something fresh to murder. Apart from the stale-
ness of the music, the Japanese attitudes and
antics have grown too familiar with use. In conse-
quenoe, stage geishas take no pains to draw the
line between beauty and burlesque, and the whole
business verges on caricature.
* * #•
Melodrama still holds the stage in Adelaide.
At the Royal, the Dampiers have played the
romance of Starlight, generous robber and good-
natured manslaughterer, for all it was worth, and
comic policemen have scuttled at the sight of a
gun-barrel for the last time. The co. is now (with
one eye on a perspiring thermometer) producing
“ The Exiles of Siberia.” At the Tivoli, a greatly-
daring amateur crowd put up “As You Like It”
for one night only. It chanced to be the most
sultry evening of the month, and a conscientious
rendering was lavished on a deadly small house.
Latterly a largely-local crowd has been playing
“The Two Orphans” and “The Scamps of
London.”
Queensland Premier Morgan accepted the
somewhat mauled Elections Act Amendment Bill
—to the disgust of some members of the Leg.
Council, who thought they had mauled it enough
to get Morgan to throw it behind the grate.
Morgan, however, calmly took what he got, and
told the disgusted Eat people that he would put
the other things in another bill, and give the
Council a chance to throw that out. If it does,
he’ll be able to appeal to the country on the
partly-liberalised franchise ; and that’s a sort of
appeal which the Council has never had to face
hitherto.
Senator Symon, the curious compound of
Tory and Radical whom Reid had the great luck
to rope-in when he built his Ministry, has been
grinding the Sydney calico-dealer, M'Millan, into
powder. M'Millan pompously wrote to the papers
of three cities declaring that the Sea Carriage of
Goods Act was the usual outrage ; and he wound
up with the customary vague remarks concerning
“ representative government,which meant
nothing, but were necessary to indicate that the
calico-dealer is really a statesman whose wisdom
is too deep for ordinary mortals to fathom. After
showing that the Act doesn’t make shipping co. s
responsible for anything whatever except negli-
gence, Symon crushingly adds that M'Millan
himself “for many years strove unsuccessfully m
the Sydney Chamber of Commerce to do what we
succeeded in doing in a few months.”

Again, what has become of the profits made by the pur-
chase of the bank’s old deposit receipts at a discount?
The position compares with that of 12 months ago :

A and B deposits .. . .3,910,359 3,581,053 £328,676
About £260,000 of A deposits have been redeemed at par
during the 12 months, which would leave over £68,000
represented by B deposits : and these presumably have
been bought up at current market rates—from 1 Is. to 12s.
in the £. Formerly the profit thus derived was shown in
a special account, but it is not now shown at all. Possi-
bly it is being used to write down securities or provide
for losses ; but it is desirable that something definite
should be known about it. It isn’t much use comparing
the position in other respects with that disclosed 12
months ago, because the report then issued contained all
the old fictitious values. But this comparison may be of
some value :

New deposits, which are a first charge on all assets, are
increasing; but advances have been reduced. Still, it
can’t be said whether the latter is due to realisation of
bad old securities or to the shrinkage of new business.
All new liabilities to the public total £1,186,792 ; so the
liquid assets much more than cover them. Even when
another £254,000 of A deposits are repaid on March Ist,
assuming the other figures to remain constant, all new
liabilities will be represented by 87 p.c. of liquid assets ;
and anything like big banking profits are impossible
under those conditions, so it isn’t surprising that on
shareholders’ funds a return of only £3 15s. 6d. p.c. p.a. is
shown. Considering the amount of idle money, even
those figures indicate that the bank is now doing some
satisfactory business.

Under the bank’s new Act, 75 per cent, of the net profits
are available to repay depositors, instead of 50 per cent. ;
hence the change shown above. The change is, however,
only in the distribution of profits ; there is an almost
miraculous sameness about the profits themselves ; and
when that sameness happens too long a suspicion creeps
in that the figures aren’t really worth much. The last
year or so has been a better time for Queensland than any
for some years ; both other Queensland banks show an
improvement; and the Q.N., with its heavy interests in
the Downs and the West, ought to have bad abetter time
than the others. Yet the figures don’t show it. So one
wonders if the Q.N. has discovered some new hole that
needs filling up with undisclosed profits. Comparing the
present position with that of 12 months ago, these results
show up:—

Under the Q.N.’s old reconstruction scheme
the debt to the State was payable as to 25 per cent, out
of profits without interest (this is where the half-yearlv
£3OOO shown above has gone) and as to 75 per cent, in five
instalments of £274,999 between 1917 and 1921. Under
the new arrangement 17 promissory notes, for £86,098
each, falling in one a year until 1921, have been substi-
tuted. The progress made in clearing up the wreckage
is shown hereunder :

As hitherto, the debt to the old depositors payable out
of profits is not shown anywhere in the published ac-
counts ; and accounts that don’t show that future profits
are heavily mortgaged can’t profess to be complete. As
the result of seven years’ work, the bank has wiped out
£453,666 of itsold liabilities, while it has reduced its assets to
the extent of £280,105 ; but it has probably written other
assets down considerably (premises, &c., stood at £286,434
at the end of 1897, and are now in at £275,938), while a
new bank reserve fund of £42,000 has been created. It
isn’t very rapid progress, but it is progress. Certainly a
bank with, roughly, 14 millions of fixed deposits carrying
no interest, and nearly another 4J millions carrying very
low interest ought to show something.
Capital now.stands at £413,213; on this and re-
serves disclosed profits were at the rate of £9 13s. per
cent, per annum. Recent figures on same basis

Dec., 1902 .. 10 3 0 „ Dec., 1904 .. 913 0 „
But there’s the £954,874 of still free fixed deposits, and
the 4J millions of very cheap deposits, to be remembered
in connection with these figures. Even reckoning in
only the private depositors’ £954,874 as capital, and
assuming that the bank paid ordinary rate of interest for
all the rest, the return would be only £3 2s. per cent, per
annum. Even with the advantage of so little interest to
pay, the disclosed profits are at the rate of only 11s. per
cent, on average assets, while an average Australian bank
rate is about £l. If, then, disclosed profits are anywhere
near real profits, the Q.N. has still a long weary way to
go in the matter of writing down.
Under the Q.N.’s new arrangement it pays
back £86,097 to the State every year. Obviously that
much can’t come out of profits. This money costs the
bank, on the average, £2 12s. 6d. per cent. In ordinary
circumstances, it ought to be shockingly bad business for
a bank to pay off fixed deposits carrying only that little
interest. But, so mad was the management when the
bank was practically a branch of the Kanakilwraith
Government, that probably not much of the money is
earning even £2 12s. 6d. per cent. The Q.N. has, how-
ever, a very solid lot of liquid assets. Including bills in
transitu, these assets total £1,759,836, while all new debt
to the public and Treasury amounts to only £2,038,784,
so the liquid assets amount to very nearly 90 per
cent. More than half this is earning nothing. Presumably
the bank will draw on this, while it nurses and realises its
securities. So far as paying off the old debt is concerned,
it is in a rather worse position than it was, because (at
present rate of profits) it will have to pay off £12,000 a
year of the private debt for which it is paying no interest,
instead of £6OOO as hitherto. But if it can get rid of debt
which is costing even only £2 I2s. 6d. p.c. by using- money
which is earning nothing, then of course it is doing good
business. For all that, it’s a shocking state for a young
country to be brought to when a bank has surplus money
which can’t earn anything.

The profits for the past year are not, however, wholly
trading profits ; £47,011 was made on the sale of the
Sydney wharf properties, resumed by the Government.
Of this amount a modest £12,000 is divided by way of
bonus, bringing the dividend for the year co 10 p.c. on
the capital of £600,000, and the balance helps to establish
a formal reserve fund. The reserves have grown in this

In addition to the share capital there is 4 p.c. debenture
stock, which has stood at £209,978 throughout the period
reviewed above ; a small amount of terminable deben-
tures was finally got rid of in 1902. The amount written
off the fleet is not disclosed ; these figures, however, seem
to show that the annual cut is reasonably deep :

The additions during 1904 included the Manuka, Loongana,
and others. Apart from its fleet and property, the co.
had on Sept. 30th £231,578 in investments (nature
unspecified)—presumably the insurance reserve. On its
capital and reserves the profits last year (apart from the
wharf-sale) were £8 15s. Bd. p.c., while on the average of
the total assets they were just over 6 per cent. Consider-
ing the size of the risk the co. carries, the return is
respectable, but not as gorgeous as might have been
expected.

The reserves are : Insurance fund £38,522 (£3987 has been
added during the half year), and reserve for equalisation
of dividend £7460. The latter reserve takes the place
both of an ordinary profit and loss balance and a formal
reserve fund, and under either name it would look better
than it does at present; a reserve isn’t needed only for
paying divs. that haven’t been earned. Co.’s progress

The drought hit the North Coast Co. very heavily, but
the recovery, as shown by the earnings on capital and
reserves, is complete. Still, since the co. depends on one
district, its profits are liable to severe fluctuations, and
any single year’s returns are not much of a line to go by.
As to the line “ freeholds” in the comparison, it ought to
be added that the total for 1899, given as £39,000, is
arrived at after deducting heavy mortgages which, the
property carried. Much of this property was subsequently
resumed, and the money, as shown, put into ships.

The Perpetual of Sydney adopts what on the face of it
looks the good practice of showing portion of its income
as “ commissions reserved ” ; presumably these are corpus
commissions, or a percentage of those commissions. In
the foregoing the whole amount received over and above
expenses is shown as profits ; but the true profits are
probably rather less, because the corpus commission is not
always all profit—sometimes, when the 2J p.c. commission
for management isn’t sufficient to pay expenses, the
corpus commission has to be drawn upon. Of the total
reserves, the reserved commission account now amounts
to £17,210, an addition of £3982 during the year. Some-
thing of the co.’s progress in 10 years is shown here-

In the matter of profits p.c. of funds, the co. stands first
among Australasian trust co. ’s. Its reserves are apparently
invested mostly in mortgages, though the balance-sheet
isn’t as definite on this point as it might be. Also, the
earnings from commissions are not kept separate from
interest-earnings, so that the real value of the investments
can’t be tested. Comparing the Sydney Perpetual with
the big Melbourne co., the T., E. and A., the latter has
£7,881,720 of estates in trust; its profits are £6lBs. 3d. p.c.
on its shareholders’ funds ; and its expenses are 2s. lOd.
p.c. of trust funds.

The mains, buildings, etc., are taken in at £15,383, so the
writing-off is at the very moderate rate of about 2$ p.c.
p.a. allround. The co. now establishes a formal reserve
for renewal of plant, though there isn’t any mention that
it is going to keep it in fixed deposits or public stocks.
Gas co.’s often have “ reserves for renewal of plant,” but
they usually put them into extensions of existing plant,
and when renewals are wanted the fund which is sup-
posed to pay for them is represented by rusty pipes that
will themselves need renewing soon. After deducting
£4OO for wear and tear the Manly Co.’s profit shows
£9 Bs. p.c. on shareholders’ funds ; but if 2$ p.c. isn’t
enough to write off for wear and tear, then the true profit
is lower. The Australian Gaslight Co. (Sydney), which
has taken the risk of borrowing heavily, and is making- a
large margin on the borrowed money so far, shows
£ll 6s. on shareholders’ funds ; so the little Manly Co.
isn’t so far behind, and hasn’t any heavy loan risks.

There is also an item of £2890 in suspense, “ including
premium capital,” which will presumably go to reserves.
Of the reserves £28,175 belongs to the fund for the
renewal of plant, mains, &c., and £2202 is in the meter
fund ; so, unless there have been heavy writings off (and
there is no evidence as to that one way or the other), the
bulk of the reserves are probably only nominal. They
may, in fact, be themselves of the nature of a writing off ;
in which case, of course, the true net profits are con-
siderably less than is shown above. Still, with no
mortgage, overdraft, or debentures, but with £16,596 in
Government stock, the Newcastle Co.’s position is far
better than that of most gas co.’s, which, as a rule, divide
every penny they earn, and sometimes more.

The £250 shown as written off during the past half-
year is written off building account, which then stands
at £250. The capital is £74,469 ; deposits, £8643,
as against £12,364 at December 31st, 1903. Assets
are practically confined to advances £89,292 (against
£88,400 in 1903) and Castlereagh-street property £20,160.
The profits show £llBs. sd. p.c. p.a. on capital and reserves.
It is a very fine return, but it looks pretty easy for
£89,000 of this sort of security to be moth-eaten to the
extent of a year’s profit. Still, you can’t expect to get in
interest at the rate of a trifle over 20 p.c. p.a. without
taking fairly large risks.

Something is written off for wear and tear, but the
amount is not disclosed. Apparently, however, nothing
is written off the mine, so the profit (since it has been
made by reducing the life of the mine) isn’t true profit.
The co.’s reserves are represented by loans, which ought
to be equal to returning nearly 2$ per cent, on the capital
(£100,000). Profits from sale of coal are bunched with
interest, so that no sort of test can be applied as to the
real value of the securities.

The disaster arrived in the shape of a High Court verdict,
relating to some shares which this co. (like the Sydney
Telegraph Co.) was found to have improperly transferred;
so a loss shows up. All expenditure is bunched, wherefore it
isn’t possible to say how much of the slump is due to law
(which is presumably done with) and how much to the
poorer market for coal (which isn't). Co.’s reserves are
small ; still, in addition to its partly worked-out mine, it
has £8364 on deposit and £5OOB at its credit with the
Lithgow Coal Association.
N.S.W. banks still stick to the unclaimed
balances of accounts, even after it is morally certain the
depositor is dead and gone and has left no heirs. If he
has left heirs, and they are ignorant of the existence of
any balance, the banks don’t consider themselves obliged
to hunt them up. In a casual country like Australia dis-
appearances of both men and deposit receipts are fre-
quent. When a sum in the bank has not been operated
upon for a certain time (Parliament should fix the period)
the bank should be obliged to pay the money over to a
State account. Some Australian States and Maoriland
have legislated in this direction, but N.S.W. hasn’t.

Of the several rock drills used in Australasia,
each is claimed by its maker to be as good, or better,
than its rivals. Despite the varied opinions of various
makers, the fact stands out clear that the bulk of Aus-
tralasia’s mining folk consider the Rand Co.’s Slugger and
Little Giant types the foremost drills selling, for there are
a far greater number in use than of any other known
make. A drill’s excellence is not demonstrated by an
“ alleged record,” neither can its cost be judged by initial
price. Superior effectiveness in the long run, freedom
from repairs and consequent idleness, cost of mainten-
ance, economy of air-consumption, are all points which
mining managers consider. The opinion of the average
mine manager here as to the best types of drills has been
packed up to a startling extent by the report of a special
and independent Johannesburg committee, whose object
was to have exhaustive tests of every rock drill in use on
the Rand. The Slugger and Little Giant came first
and second respectively, their superiority over other
machines being extraordinary. Complete details of these
S. African tests will be furnished on application to N.
Guthridge Ltd., Sydney, Melbourne, and Wellington

The new electric light installation' of the Mel-
bourne Exhibition Cycle Track, formed a great attraction
of the recent “ Austral ” meeting. The main feature of
the system is the “Ganz” brilliant arc lamp, forty of
which are distributed round the track, suspended on iron
brackets. The light is absolutely steady, soft and
diffused, doing away entirely with the injurious glare
common with other lamps and overcoming the objection-
able shadows in and under the globe. Special globes are
used which, while diffusing the light, do not cut off an
undue quantity and the effect is a light known
scientifically to be the best for all illuminating purposes.
The candle power is more than four times that furnished
by other lamps at the same current consumption. Electric
lighting by the “ Ganz ” arc lamp is cheaper than any
other form of illuminant, both in first cost, in fixing and
in maintenance. The contractors for this installation
were the Austral Otis Engineering Co., Ltd., corner
Hannah and Kavanagh streets, South Melbourne, Sole
Agents for Ganz and Co., Budapest, Hungary, who will
gladly furnish estimates and expert advice upon similar

Economical Gold Mining.—Low grade ores
and high cost in fuel and wages have made it imperative
that managers and engineers should reconstruct upon
more economical lines. Heretofore the boiler plant was
given little consideration, but the introduction of the
Hornsby “ upright ” water tube boiler having demons-
trated great economy, and with safety under indifferent
conditions of feed water, it is now superseding other types.
In W.A. these boilers are worked with an economy not
heretofore known on those fields, and in Queensland over
'2500 h.p. is on order for the Mount Morgan Gold Mining
Co. It is cleaned in one fourth the time of other boilers
and has no tube troubles. Boilers may be seen in opera-
tion in Sydney and Melbourne. R. Hornsby and Sons,

The Babcock Boiler seems to be favored by
mining engineers, over 50 mines in Australia using these
boilers. Mount Morgan has 20, Waihi Gold Mining Co.
24, Mount Lyell 12, Tasmanian Gold Mining Company 7,
and at Broken Hill there are 30 distributed amongst the
mines, water works, and electric supply, while in
Western Australia they are looked upon as a necessity,
there being now 68 in the principal mines and Kalgoorlie
Water Supply. It will be noted that coal is expensive at
Broken Hill, and wood fuel is expensive at W.A. These
figures speak for themselves. Evidently the ease of
transportation, the economy in fuel and maintenance and
the adaptability to any class of fuel, that are such con-

A bailiff's work has generally been regarded
as appropriate only to a big, burly and preferably
beery man. But last week, at fashionable St.
Kilda (Vic.), an attractive-looking young woman
knocked at a resident’s door, walked into the hall,
pushed a distress warrant into the astonished
householder’s hand, and proceeded about her busi-
ness in the style of an experienced “bum.”
This woman bailiff has taken permanently to the
profession.
HE DISTRIBUTED HIS ATTENTIONS.
SYMPATHETIC FRIEND: “Is your husband attentive, dear?”
MRS. DE SWIFT: “Dear me, yes! His lady friends have
nothing to complain of on that score.”
The fate of the trangressor has overtaken
Albury (N.S.W.). The border town is within the
geographical limits to qualify for various conces-
sions allowed by the Public Service Board—par-
ticularly as regards the education system—on
account of climatic disadvantages. In its deter-
mination to grab the Federal capital, Albury
flatly declined to accept these concessions,
claiming that Albury’s climate was its best point,
and that none of its inhabitants needed con-
sideration on torrid zone conditions. Now Albury
hasn’t got the Federal capital, and the 1904-5
summer has put up heat records which make the
miserable, half-fried folk wish that they’d never
mentioned such a thing as a salubrious climate.
A recent. Sydney marriage of some note
was thought of suddenly, and as suddenly com-
pleted. The man and the girl—a very nice girl—
were dining—a very nice dinner—at a Sydney
restaurant —a very nice little room, with appro-
priate wall paper of Yenus-and-her-doves design.
After dinner the man suggested, “ Why shouldn’t
we get married ?’’ There was no reason why, and
they rang up a parson and were married straight
away. Sensible people ! They avoided the fuss
and flummery and other undesirable trimmings to
a formal wedding. “ Marry in haste, repent at
leisure,” the pessimist will croak. But what need
to repent at all ?

“ Jack Shay ” tells an incident of a bygone
N.S.W. coal strike :—•
The engineer’s boy was in the store-room of the
colliery. He was digging tallow out of a cask for the
locomotive-driver.
Two miners going on shift looked in the door-way.
“ Gi’e I some fat for t’ lamp, laad ! ”
He was a good-natured boy, and it wasn’t his tallow.
He gave them each a couple of pounds of tallow, which
they secreted in their crib cans. Word of that tallow
went round, and for several mornings following the
“laad” was rushed in a quiet way for tallow. The
deputy was underground inspecting, and the manager
not about. It was nobody’s business to note the men
hanging about the door of the store-shed.
The boy was at work with the engineer in the sump off
No. 2 flat repairing a pump that had gone wrong. On the
flat two ; miners were seated. They had come out of the
bord to munch their crib. One of tire men took a hunk
of damper from his crib can, cut it open, and proceeded
to spread tallow on it and eat; ditto his mate. The en-
gineer Wasn’t surprised to hear they were eating fat on
their bread. ‘ “ Lucky to get it,” he said.
The rest of it fell from him in bits, and was news to the
lad, who was a stranger in the district. “ Seven months
idle... All’ the stores’ll give’em is flour... No tea or
sugar or anything else.... Ask ’em for a drink of tea,
and you’ll find it’s only water they’re drinkin’. Can’t
blame the storekeepers; the strike played hell with them.
Wonder where they copped the drippin’.”
He found out next morning. Guessed it as soon as he
looked in the cask, and he kept the key afterwards. That
was the sequel of a successful cut in the hewing rate.

“S.” : Father Hays, the
It.C. teetotal revivalist, is shak-
ing up the beer-eaters in Mel-
bourne, and Mick, and Pat,
and Tim, and Larry, having
come under his magnetic in-
fluence (his “chin” strongly
resembles that of a noble Homan
on a time-worn coin), are wrestl-
ing with their consuming desire
for fermented liquors—and con-
quering the desire miserably.
Already the revival is said to
have seriously interfered with
the trade in one suburb with a
powerful Hibernian element.
Of course, the reaction will come
as soon as Father Hays removes
that personal magnetism which
is three-parts of the battle in all
revivals, and then there’ll be a
run on beer again that will
make the local breweries fairly
hum. In nine cases out of ten
revival converts are only subject
to the will-power of the revival-
ist, and when the latter removes
his influence they slump like a
house of cards in a gale.

“ S.” : Be steamship offi-
cers’ hours on the Australian
coast, instance the s.s. Barcoo,
which carries the N.Q. mails.
The Barcoo reaches Townsville
early on Monday morning and
leaves again at 10 p.m. on Mon-
day night on her return trip to
Brisbane. In the interval she
has to be emptied of cargo and
loaded with southern freight.
She reaches Brisbane about
noon Thursday, and leaves
again at 9 a m. on Friday, coal-
ing, unloading and reloading,
taking in stores, &c., in the
interval. If any repairs happen
to be required all the worse for
officers and crew. Once a year,
when the boat misses a trip for
an overhaul, the men get a
spell. The rest of the year they
sometimes get time to go home and get a clean
shirt and count their families. No Sundays or
Saturdays off.

-A-fc latest the committee of the Heidelberg
-d'^" US mP Hospital had got over its dispute
with rSem 1 homas as to opening the new Kron-
heimer consumptive wing by putting up tents in
the grounds to accommodate some 40 patients who
were begging for admission. So Melbourne, as
part of the penalty of its Bent, witnesses the
amazing spectacle of dying consumptives passing:
away in tents in the Hospital grounds while an
up-to-date, comfortable ward stands idle alongside
awaiting permission to open its doors.
A WEDDING ANNOUNCEMENT.
“ What, leaving me, Mary I Where are you going?”
“To Babyland.”
“Mark Moore” sends some fire sparks
from Albury (N.S.W.): —
One young- squatter was driving a pretty girl to the
railway station when the fire rushed on them. The girl’s
skirt caught fire arid was promptly discarded. Petticoat
ignited ; discarded. Buggy-rug requistioned ; ignited.
Likewise buggy. Then conventionality was forgotten,
and they had to race for life on foot.
A little girl on Mangoplah Station saved a valuable
stallion from a burning stable. Nervy performance fora
kiddie to face fire and a frightened stallion.
The rabbits got Hades in the fire, and the smell of fried
bunny pervades Riverina. But they had their revenge.
Many times when the fire had been beaten it was started
again by maddened rabbits, their fur a-fire, rushing for
slffelt.er into the long dry grass. In one instance the men
had by terrific efforts beaten the flames off a crop, when a
burning bunny rushed between two of them out of the
flames into the crop—and it all went.
The luck of some. Near VVagga one station had been
delivered ovep with all stock excepting the horses, which
had been removed only two days before the fire swept
away homestead, grass, fences and stock. When a man
has It stacks all insured but two, and fire burns all except
those two, he-should take a ticket in “Tatt’s.” That
happened to a German farmer near Albury.

The Kaiser’s sister, Princess Charlotte, wife
of Prince Bernard of Saxe Meiningen, has written
a pamphlet advocating polygamy as a remedy for
social ills. The Kaiser is indignant, and naturally
so. Royalty shouldn’t preach polygamy; it
suffices that Royalty generally practises it.

Manly ocean beach just now is anything
but a resort for nerve-racked invalids. Band and
concert hoardings and platforms are everywhere ;
and, worst infliction of all, a miniature shrieking
and groaning railway train plies ceaselessly
up. and down the esplanade from morn till
night. Is the council so desperately hard up
that such catchpenny means of income are a
necessity, or what ? The old peace and beauty of
the beach are gone. The village has a look always
of having been out all night.

“P.” : Since the new year some forty
youths after serving an apprenticeship of
seven years—have been dismissed from N.S.W.
tramway mechanical department. The Rail-
way Commissioners state that, while boys
and youths are always wanted, before they
enter the service they are notified that when
they grow to manhood they may not be
employed. But they surely are not notified that,
when they grow to manhood, they will be
discharged! And anyhow, how can public
employers—like the Railway Commissioners—be
described, except in terms of odium, who are
willing to avail themselves of the services of lads
during the seven plastic and informative years of
their lives, and then, when the term is com-
pleted, turn them heartlessly adrift upon the
world unfitted to follow any other calling ?

What time the Tory press is howling out
frantically for “ more population ” for this blessed
land, the Tory’s banks are doing their best to keep
the population down. An ex-junior manager of
the Commercial Bank, Melbourne, was before the
St. Kilda Bench the other day for not maintaining
his wife and child. He pleaded he hadn’t earned
more than a few shillings since he’d been sacked
by the institution of which Henry Gyles Turner
used to be the bright particular star, for the sin of
getting married when he was only drawing £2 a
week, thereby breaking one of the bank’s most
solemn regulations.
At the Central Police Court (Sydney) on?
27th January a police constable pleaded guilty to.
having stolen £3 2s. 3d. from a drunken man
whom he had taken in charge. He was fined £lO,
in default three months’ imprisonment; but as he
was allowed one month within which to pay the
money, the “in default ” was merely formal. At.
the same court, and on the same day, a woman
pleaded guilty to having stolen a blouse. She was
sentenced to three months’ hard labor without the.
option. The two sentences, read together, suggest
that the law is riot only an ass, but such an ass as
not to know the danger of being merciful to the
servant who is found poisoning its water supply.
For a thieving constable there should be at least
as stern punishment as for the woman who prigs
a triiie.

Be the average time (17 months) expended
inputting an appeal through the Privy Council.
The Australian longest - case -on - record was
Dougherty v. the Bank of Australasia, which had
been lodged with the P.O. for seven years before
the judgment came. The quickest was the Liberty
and Alliance Mining Co’s v. Russell, a Melb. case
that threw the local French community into con-
vulsions some years ago, and has left a trail of
hatred and malice behind it. Melb. Full Court
gave a decision on March 30, and lawyer Joe
Woolf, acting for the London companies, rushed
their appeal along to the Privy Council, who upset
the Melbourne judgment on May 30. There is a
difference of 6 years and 10 months between the
maximum and minimum records.

Retrenchment has now stepped into N.S.
Wales prison service, and has snatched a portion
of the scanty fare provided for Burglar Bill and
his mates. All prisoners receiving No. 4 ration,
excepting blacksmiths, washermen and laborers,
have been put back on No. 3, and a saving of loz.
of beef and a “spud” per man thus effected.
Prisoners have revived an old convict term,
consequently, and dubbed this the “Pinchgut”
Government.

The Tory press of the Commonwealth is.
all sympathy for the Russian strikers and all
execration for their Slav oppressors. It was not
so when the miner-maritime strike was proceeding
in Australia. There was then a general demand for
the enrolment of special constables and blacklegs,
and there were no fulminations against the fire-
brand order, “Fire low and lay them out.” The •
Tory papers’ views on Labor matters are latitu-
dinanan—that is to say, they change with the ■
latitude. What is damnable tyranny in Russia is,
freedom of contract in Australia.

Not much has been said about the second'
romantic marriage of an ex-Melbourne girl. The.
lady’s husband in the first place was an invalid,,
young but wrecky—so wrecky that at last he re-
quired the constant attention of a male attendant..
The husband went the way of all flesh, and his;
bath chair had not been vacant more than a few
weeks when his impatient widow gave her hand
and fortune (£50,000 or more) to the lucky atten-
dant. This counts as a slight set off against
the number of male capitalists (elderly and other-
wise) who have been captured by the Nurse —not
always the calm, cool spinster in attendance on
their own ailments, but sometimes the nursie who
had shaken up the pillows for poor dear wife
No. 1.
AFTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A half-smoked cigarette ;
The petals of a rose ;
A sudden mad regret,
And then the passion goes.
A pair of lips that met;
A love that flamed and froze—
Dead rose, burnt cigarette ;
Oh, poetry and prose !

When a 14-year-old youngster is found doing seven
hours per day in some manufacturing industry the
air is rent asunder with the shriek of the Free-

industries by Protection leads to all manners of

ever asked a kiddie to toil 16J hours per diem as
the great “ natural ” cow-milking job does ?
Senator Bob Best proposes to sweeten
his forthcoming health trip to England by doing a
little bit of business for the Melbourne Metropolitan
Board of Works. The Board is appealing to the
Privy Council against a Vic. Full Court decision
practically denying the Board’s power of rating
the mains of the Metropolitan Gas Co., which is a
test case with a lot of big questions hanging to it.
Best undertakes to stay in London two months
; for a fee of £250, or one month for £l5O, in readi-
■ness to represent the Board if the appeal comes on
>for hearing while he breathes the cockney atmo-
sphere. This reasonable offer has been accepted
by Bard Fitz Gibbon and co., and Melbourne in
general approves. If Best assists to divert some
iof the Gas monopoly s profits into the Board of
Works revenue he will come back with a halo
(round his brow.
FROM A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW.
HE : “ I’d propose to you if I only knew what I
should say.”
SHE: “ You wouldn't if you only knew what I'd
say.”
According to Vic. Inspector of Charities
Short, last year’s total expenditure on the State’s
hospitals was £125,326, of which maintenance took
£94,662, leaving £30,664 as the actual cost of the
patients. If the State undertook the maintenance
and management of the whole bag of tricks it
simply couldn't make a worse showing than this,
and it would probably do a vast deal better.
SOCIETY ITEM.
BARMAID: “ We don't
serve ladies with
drink here.”
FEMALE SCAREOROW : “I don' wan' be shewed
mith a drink, Mish. I have cornp’ny to-
morrer, an' I wan’ three-penn’orth ov sherry
wine ter make a tipsy cake.”
The Customs dilemma about black and
yellow hairpins recalls some Customs puzzles of
the old State days. One of them was Victoria’s
bewilderment over a case of water from Lourdes,
consigned to a R.C. monastery. A gauger know-
ingly sampled a bottle, but failed to fix its charac-
ter. Another, after sampling, thought it might
be a patent medicine. Government Analyst
Blaclcet was called in, and after many tests, pro-
nounced it mere water. The further puzzle was
then to find what anybody imported water for,
and this would have prematurely aged the officials
had not a clergyman presented himself and asked
for “ a case of miraculous water.”
A. young person, who travelled to England
, with a bright
theatrical star, be-
came engaged en
route to one of the
ship’s officers.
She made arrange-
ments to return
in the same ship
with him, but in
the meantime he
was transferred to
another vessel. As
he was thus not
able to personally
look after his girl,
he introduced her
to his best friend,
who was travel-
ling on that vessel.
From one of the
ports near to
England, the
girl cabled to
the officer
the news
of her en-
gagement
to the friend.
But to marry him she has to return to England,
and this third voyage may suggest yet a different
bridegroom.
* * * *
The practical, square-headed paterfamilias
has hit on a plain, common-sensible scheme for get-
ting his daughters settled matrimonially. He looks
out the likeliest young man in his employ, gives
him an abrupt increase of salary, and introduces
him to the ‘ girls.’ The promising bachelor picks
the best of the bunch and resigns himself to dad’s
employ for the rest of his life. Sometimes
he’s taken into the firm. One Melbourne mer-
chant even builds houses for his prospective sons-
in-law. Thus the eligible girl is given away with
an eligible villa.
* * * *
In years past homoeopathy made several
unsuccessful attempts to establish itself as a public
healer in Sydney. Its light flickered for a while
and then went out. But the present hospital
looks lasting. It has big patrons and enthusiastic
pushers. It had 782 out-patients and 111 in-
patients last week, and begins to expect the
Government pound-for-pound subsidy.
“ P.M.” : “ Sailor-man’s ” consul who
didn’t condemn the putrid meat when appealed to
by the crew has no prototype in Australia. Ship-
ping masters in the . Commonwealth generally
sympathise with the men, and the captains get
very little consideration if a case is proved against
a ship. Not 12 months ago, on complaint from
the crew, the stores of a sailing ship to the value
of £l2O were condemned in Melbourne and thrown
overboard in the presence of a Customs officer.
Treatment of sailors in respect to food is
improving. Many vessels voluntarily adopt
the Board of Trade’s new scale, which is
not compulsory, but put forward as a suggestion.
It includes vegetables and tinned variants of the
eternal salt-junk and pork. No decent skipper
completes a voyage without killing at least one pig
for the sole benefit of the crew, and giving them
the luxury of roast fresh pork. All the same,
there are some notoriously starved ships, but it is
not always the “old man’s” fault. A captain
actually admitted to me, the other day, that his
men had deserted at Melbourne because they had
been starved. He blamed the owners. That was
a big steamer-tramp. But tramps are the hungriest
of ocean hells. They go nosing round the world
for cargo like ravenous sharks, and their sole con-
cern is to get loadings at cut-throat rates and to
keep down exes.

“ Vulcan ” : In fining two youngsters for
offensive pranks at a temperance meeting, lately,
the North Melbourne Bench bewailed the fact
that it couldn’t order the kids to be whipped.
The force refused to wield the birch. Seeing that
at present the parent has to pay the fine, and
generally takes it out of the youngster’s hide after-
wards, why not give the old man himself the
option of belting the culprit to the Court’s satis-
faction ?
* * * *
At the Glebe (Sydney) police court re-
cently among other folk convicted of watering milk
was a carter for a firm whose name was not dis-
closed. He was fined £5 and costs, in default one
month’s imprisonment, for having per cent, of
added water in his milk. The inspector stated
that the carters of the firm for which this man
worked had been already fined four times for a
similar offence. And the name of the firm is care-
fully suppressed in the police reports instead of
being held up for due public execration !
Two shy little Collins-st.
florists crept into a city court
recently and played joint
plaintiff in a case not devoid
of its romantic side. A well-
known Melbourne Johnnie
had been supplying forget-
me-not sprays and posies of
remembrance violets to his
inamoratas until the unpaid
balance of his account was
seven sovereigns, and the
girls wanted the money. The
law ordered the forget-me
creditor to pay up without
further simpering.
“IT.”: Vic. Police Commis-
sioner O’Callaghan should be given
credit for one thing. Since he as-
sumed the control of the police
force, sectarianism, rife previously,
has been almost killed. Three or
four years ago the color-line was
drawn very sharply. Every time a
Green constable was charged with
an offence, half-a-dozen other Greens
would turn up to swear to his inno-
cence. Every time an Orange officer
laid a charge it was against a subordinate of the
other sect. O’Callaghan has stopped all that.
The big Victorian law suit, which ended
in ajudgment that took the Chief Justice eight-and-
a-half hours to read, and involved a verdict
against the Australian Alliance Co. for over
£113,000, shows what one angry clerk can do. Ihe
trouble was mainly between the life policy-holders
and the co„ and most of the money talked about
was profit which it is alleged those policy-holders
ought to have got, but which it was alleged the
shareholders had taken. Back early in 1902 some
proposals of the directors got on the nerves of the
gentleman (Mr. A. R. Dowling) who had
been for years in charge of the life
branch of the business, and who looked at
the matter from the policy-holders point
of view, and he wrote a “ snorting letter
to the directors. The reply was the prompt sack.
And then the trouble really began. He tried to
o-et some satisfaction, and, instead, got a lawyer s
fetter telling him he had better not say things
about the co. Apparently he was wrong sort
of man to send that sort of letter to. He whipped
up a few of the policy-holders. Most of them
(there were 2000 or so) were old men, and very
tired, and reckoned they had no say anyhow
in running a proprietary office, even though they
were policy-holders, and so didn’t turn up.
But the few who did take an interest m the matter
put up a trifle, and the huge legal row was started
on about £250. That set the pot boiling, until it
bubbled over into one of the biggest verdicts ever
given by an Australian law-court. Of course, the
litigation isn’t over yet; there are appeals
ahead.
Victorian seaside and country beauty spots
last holiday season were dotted with the white
tents of jaded townsfolk, who just gasped to get
under canvas and experience the joys of a free,
fresh open-air life. Now, when it is mostly over,
the inhabitants of the places so favored are crying
out for protection from the ignorance of the
campers, who were mostly greenhorns at the game.
Their sanitary arrangements were abominable, and
fever has broken out at several places as a conse-
quence. They also burnt all scrub shelter and
everything they could lay their hands on for. fire-
wood, and made themselves a nuisance generally.
The authorities ought to take on several experi-
enced bushies, as showmen, to hold practical
demonstrations in the Botanical and Fitzroy
Gardens on the gentle art of camping-out, before
next holidays. •

There is now just about enough modern
field artillery ammunition in the Commonwealth
to sink a dozen boat-loads of invaders; and,' as a
result, the three days’ practice of the Vic. artil-
lery at Lancefield had to be conducted with old-
fashioned black gunpowder. The guns were made
for cordite, the sights arranged on the understand-
ing that it was to be used, and the men had all
been trained to lay their guns according to the
ballistics of the higher explosive. Considering
these facts, the practice was just about as useful
as if it had been carried out with the Chow
cannons looted by the Australian naval contin-
gents from Pekin. Indeed, only half of the
rounds arranged for could be fired off, and those
at grave risk to guns and gunners. And Major-
General Hutton is just now busy telling England
that he left Australia in proud possession of the
most efficient military system in the Empire ! ”

THE BULK OF THE PEOPLE.—A FEW
WEIGHTY WORDS.
STOUT PERSON (warmly): “That lean rat of a
fellow , sirs, is one of those confounded
Socialistic agitators who arc seeking to rob us
of our substance. When I think that such a
penniless .starveling has the same weight in
the country as a man like me, by Heaven,
gentlemen, I cannot express my indignation.
And these rascals have the sympathy of the
bulk of the people—the bulk of the people,
gentlemen! ”
FELLOW FAT (at back, consolingly): “Nay, nay,
John, I think the bulk is with us.”
Captain Scott-Harden, war correspondent
for London Daily Chronicle and Graphic, now
in Australia—who ought to know :
I sympathise with the Japanese in this war, but still I
think that we shall have to fight against Japan in
time. ... In Manila I met Gen. Oorben and Admiral
Stirling, the American military and naval commanders,
and they also had no doubt that one day the Anglo-Saxon
race would have to fight Japan. . . . Japanese spies are
everywhere. In Sydney and Melbourne there are men
ostensibly in business, but really in the service of the
Government. . . . You are quite right to keep the
Eastern races out of Australia, though the Chinese, I see,
are still pouring into Port Darwin and Thursday Island.
CONFESSION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I must admit when pretty lips
Allure my captive senses
I kiss them whosesoe’er they be
Sans moralists pretences.
My chance of reformation, too,
Is never worth a penny,
For if to one I should be true,
I must be false to many.
HAMER.
UNSATISFIED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The young man’s prayer—“ Fate, lest f die
Give me her e’en tor one short hour ; ”
The maiden, hearing in her bower,
Surrenders with a troubled cry.
Alack for Time’s unfeeling power !
Long years of fret and scold go by ;
An old man looks Fate in the eye,
And sighs : “ I asked for one short hour! ”

“THE VARNISHED BOARD”
A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, January 31, 1905.
My Dear Arint.—
Flies and heat have kept so many hostesses
from entertaining anything except an intense dis-
like for crowds of any kind that Mrs. Allen
Taylor’s reception at the Town Hall last week was
a pleasant break in the monotony. Rumored that
3500 people were present. Quite likely, and a
good many of the poor things must have been
nearly starving if one may judge by the way that
they descended on the refreshment tables. The
hand to hand struggle for the ice-creams made
one think of the pictures of the battle of Sha-ho.
But it was a good-humored struggle all the same,
by that huge army which filed in two and two
through the barrier like the animals that went
into the Ark when the drought broke up.
Pink electric lights and many cart-loads of orna-
mental vegetables helped to set off the beauties of
the Town Hall, human as well as architectural.
Strange, isn’t it, that a face that looks by day-
light like a chunk of blue stone that has escaped
the hammer of the unemployed, becomes trans-
figured in the rosy glow of a pink electric light
until it is almost nice-looking. Same sort of a
thing, in a small way, is the effect of sunset in
making a frowsy lighter, full of bone-dust, look
like a spirit-ship.
The Mayoress shakes hands in a good, honest,
warm, substantial way. There is none of that
“I’ll-let-it-lie-there-and-you-can-squeeze-it-if-you-
dare” of the too-experienced hand-shaker about
her. She wore black peau-de-soie with a little
white vest, and ostrich feathers in a large black
hat, which had strings of the ever-useful tulle.
How on earth would we all get on if somebody
cornered the world’s available supply of tulle?
It softens the angles of the elderly, makes the
middle-aged look juvenile again, and is not to be
despised by the youngest “flapper” amongst us.
If tulle did not exist already—as the Frenchman
said of religion—it would be necessary to invent it.
Cream, pale grey, and heliotrope seemed to be
the most favored shades of color, and silk muslin,
voile and crepe de chine the general materials.
Elaborate dressing on some of the backs that one
sees nowadays moves one almost to tears. I could
pick out a few of the Town Hall guests who would
still be unfit for publication if they were dressed
by Worth in cloth of gold—but I won’t. And I
could pick out just one or two who would look
distinguished even if they were dressed in gunny-
bags.
While waiting for a turn at the pen and the
visitors’ book, I could not help noticing the
remarkable writing of some of the callers.
When a stout lady, with her right glove half on
and half off, and wearing a 22in. waist by mistake
instead of her customary 28in., is suddenly called
upon in a crowd to write her name, the result is
such as would make any knowing bank clerk ring
up the police at once. Saw one dame perform the
operation. She got the pen into the middle of the
inkpot every time, but there her success ended.
Before she had finished she had blotted a pearl-
grey crepe, that was next to her on one side, and
added a few uncalled for details to the pattern of
a spotted silk muslin on the other. There was ink
as well as pearl-powder on her nose. She had
split her glove and lost her temper, and, worst of
all, when I tried to read her name for public
information, I couldn't.
What is the subtle connection between fireworks
and love-making? Never saw so many sweet
young things making goo-goo eyes in dark corners
as at the Agricultural Show Ground the other
night. They did not care for the band, and a
Scottish ballad, sung by a 40-horse power con-
tralto, failed to stir them perceptibly. But when
the illuminated elephants see-sawed on a clever
set piece, soft eyes looked love to eyes that spake
again, and the spectacle of two cats in red and
blue fire approaching each other amorously on the
roof of Sheol hypnotised the sundry happy pairs
with thoughts of “Oh, vvhat would it be to be
there!” But the destruction of Port Arthur gave
the best value in mixed emotions. Under
cover of big guns and bursting mines, blown-up
forts and sinking battleships, the most aggressive
squeezes were uncontested. When the whole
world seems to be rocking on its foundations
prudery becomes inopportune. There is a lot of
human nature at a fireworks show—if you are only
owl enough to see it.
There was a young lady in Maoriland a while ago
•who insisted on being buried at sea—like the
owner of the “Mary Gloucester” that Rudyard
has kippled about. A fad for being buried in salt
water is fairly common, but people who deliberately
go out to sea to get married are rarer. The forth-
coming Bagsliaw-Turnbull wedding in South
Australia is to be stage-managed with the long
wash of Australasian seas as a back ground, and
in the near distance the steward who ups
and hastens in readiness to come on when his
cue is given. The bridegroom is the son of
an Adelaide machinery magnate, and the bride
is the daughter of a west coast squatter. A
specially chartered launch is to take the wedding
party out beyond the three mile limit somewhere
off Port Lincoln, and a search party is now scouring
the Holy City for a parson who’s been vaccinated
against mal-de-ir;er. The mandate to take the lady
for better or worseand to love and cherish herin sea-
sickness and in health “as long as ye both shall
live,” may test the fortitude of the bridegroom
sooner than he expects.
If the marriage at sea becomes fashionable,
what about the christening of the harmless neces-
sary twins in the Great Australian Bight when
they arrive ?
India is keeping up its reputation as a place to
get married at. Old man Leiter’s daughters, with
sacksful of dollars gathered in the wheat pit of
Chicago, are going off like hot cakes. It was
hardly settled that Major Colin Campbell was to
take Miss Nancy Leiter for richer or poorer, before
the announcement went forth that the Earl of
Suffolk is to make Miss Daisy Leiter a countess.
Lady Curzon’s nose will be somewhat put out of
joint by her sister the countess, because the Earl
dates back to Queen Elizabeth, or the early
Christians, or the Deluge, or something like that,
and Lord Curzon was plain “Mister” within the
memory of living man. Still, Lady Curzon has
ridden on a triumphal elephant in a Durbar, and
nothing can take that glory from her. Both
sisters got engaged at Simla, where Mrs. Hawks-
bee came from, and where the phantom rickshaw
goes past Jakko Hill o’ nights.
There are still a few eligible bridegrooms left in
India. Kitchener didn’t marry that handsome
Waler after all, and if he is not too busy making
wire entanglements up in the hills to trip up the
Russians, he might have time to think of taking a
wife. And there are others. Now that the Aus-
tralian Commercial Agent in Asia is pushing
business, what’s the matter with sending a con-
signment of willowy Sydney-siders to Simla on
appro. ?
I have just heard of a chef who can hollow out
a baby-pineapple, stuff it with with a mixture of
chopped apples, maraschino, cherries, celery, and
its own extracted vitals, and pop the top on again
so that no one would imagine it to have been
tampered with. You might try the elegant
recipe.
Pending the result of Dr. Susie O’Reilly’s
attempt to get more public recognition for women
doctors, those who want to fill an aching void
might do worse than become women dentists.
The supply of aching voids never seems to run
short. If one must have some one prowling
round one’s mouth looking for holes with the
suspicious success of a plumber on a search for
leaks in a gas pipe, there are, to a woman,
obvious advantages in having the small digits of a
dexterous female stump extractor, rather than the
huge paws of the male dentist. And when the
prospective patient is a weeping urchin, a woman
has a much better chance of getting the
job over before bedtime than a man, on ac-
count of her wider knowledge of goo-goo talk.
There are a few lady dentists in Sydney
already, and they find much favor with the people
who are kept awake at night by red-hot pains
in their jaws and pumpkin-like swellings of the
face. Miss Maggie Hamilton, of Hunter-street,
who has been practising for eight years, is the
senior female puller-out of unconsidered trifles in
Sydney, and she does all her own plate-making
and mechanical work, when she has to put in a set
of artificial teeth. Another smooth-voiced but
iron-wristed practitioner is Miss Praed. The
mechanical part of dentistry is not unlike the
smithwork of a manufacturing jeweller. Just the
job for a woman who is smart with her fingers,
and a great deal more lucrative than crewel work
or painting panels of consumptive roses.
The lady dentist must expect to have to swallow
occasional doses of the kind of language that the
arresting constable writes down on a piece of
paper and hands up to the bench. She endures it
philosophically from her own patients, but there
are times when it is hard to suffer and be silent.
One of the best known of the tribe in Sydney was
invited by a male practitioner to his surgery in
order to witness, along with other members of the
calling, the application of a new method of pain-
less extraction by electricity.. The patient was a
burly bushm xn who had been blarneyed into the
confident belief that having a root ploughed out
by electricity was as enjoyable as a night at the
Tivoli. He took his seat in the chair, with a
broad grin at the rows of the males and a
quiet wink at the lady. Then the proud
operator seized a wire, switched on a buzzing
current, and delivered a short lecture, showing
that the application of that particular brand of
electricity produced complete insensibility to pain
m the part affected. When he had produced per-
fect local amesthesis, he purposed to pull the
stump out or burst. Whereupon he applied a
small metal disc at the end of the wire to the
bushman’s furthest, biggest, and most dissipated-
looking molar. A shriek of mortal agony went
up as the victim escaped from the chair, and
unloaded his vocabulary, while he shook a hairy
fist in the painless dentist’s face. The rival pro-
fessionals, who had intended to offer discreet
congratulations on the new system, stuffed their
mouths with anything that came handy, for fear
their smiles, might precipitate a crisis. But the
man who had imported the buzz machine from
America was not at all disconcerted. It was all
caused by an exposed nerve, he explained,
fluently. The bushman had incautiously exposed
his nerve, and spoilt the demonstration. It was
decided- m consultation afterwards that the indi-
vidual who exposed most nerve in the matter was
not the patient, but the operator.
Lady Hopetoun was always a genuine sport,
who preferred horses and dogs to the ordinary
callers at Government House any day. She
would rather break her nose out hunting than
have to talk to the Premier’s wife or dance vis-a-
vis to a bullet-headed suburban mayor in the
opening Lancers; but some of us ought to be thank-
ful that we escaped with our lives. She has been
keeping a famous pack of man-hunting blood-
hounds, trained “clean foot” hunters, up at
Hopetoun House. Two of the bloodhounds
belonging to this sporting dame were laid on to
the scent of a poultry thief recently and ran down
the terrified roost-robber after a tremendous
chase. Ihe scent was nine hours old, but every-
body who was there, except the man in front,
swore that it was the best run of the season. The
bloodhounds were pulled off in plenty of time,
and the thief only got a fright. But what a
fright. Makes one think of Uncle Tom with
heaving chest and goggle eyes trying to hide
himself in the cane-brake, while the baying of the
pursuing dogs (done on a fog-horn on the o.p.
side) makes the blood of the gallery damsels curdle
with terror. The Linlithgow bloodhounds have
now been sold. They cost too much trouble and
care to keep in good health, and their weekly
butcher s bill was enormous.
A pretty damsel who recently took her fate into
her hands and married a dashing sprig of an Irish-
man, without parental consent, now regrets it.
Ju ixy started to dash very soon, and, among
other misdoings, pawned wifey’s jewellery.
ifey returned home, and, after some persuasion,
the family doors and arms were opened once more.
The condition was imposed that she was never
to see or speak to hubby again.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent
“Melbourne has lost a cheery bachelor by the
death of Harry Brush, who for 20 years headed
pretty well every branch of athletics in the State,
and for a decade topped every swagger bachelor
movement. He was a hot favorite in Melbourne.
He held pride of place as a lady-killer, and stili
retained the name among city men of being a
‘ white ’ fellow. How rare it is to find a man’s
man liked by women, or vice versa! Harry
Brush’s life might have afforded material fora
companion book to Whistler’s volume of ironies
on the ‘ Gentle Art of Making Friends.’
“Mr. Colin Robertson is slowly getting back to
a steady pulse and a normal temperature after
an experience of brain-concussion. He had a col-
lision in the polo field with Captain Greville, one
of the Nortlicote aides, and received the full force
of the blow. The other lean young party escaped
with a bruise or two. The Colac womenkind all
wanted to nurse the patient on the spot. Fortu-
nately for the poloist, medical aid was at hand,
and he escaped all unqualified attentions, and so
survived.
1 A promising young Victorienne has succumbed
to too much A.N. A. Some fatality was bound to
mark the feverish rage for A.N. A. immortality.
Miss Evelyn Goodenough, after a short, brilliant
run of scholarships, medals and trophies—Bo of
the latter were scored to her credit—died last
week. ‘ Over-study ’ said the medical certificate.
For the last year or two she had figured in the
A.N. A. competitions, and beaten everyone at the
piano. Even Paderewski had approved her
style. Thus a bright, talented, charming girl has,
so to speak, dashed her brains out.
“Every well-accoutred visitor from N.S.W. who
anchors awhile in this State is regarded as a Tyson
legatee. Cup-time all the wealthy women staying
at Menzies or the Grand were said to be relatives
of ‘ the rich Tysons.’ And some of them resented
it. By the way, the fashionable St. Kilda girl,
said to be engaged to the youngest Tyson bachelor
at Cup-time, is at present perspiringly denying the
rumor. They don’t even speak now, she says.
“ Maced on becomes a little Toorak, with motors
to bear the hill-folk on calls, and all the cottages
tricked forth in town frillies for festivity. This
week the fashionable clan are reinforced by Lord
and Lady Charles Scott, who are to stay at the
Plevna Ryans’—the visiting dame is a sister of
the doctor. They bring along young Ryan, who
won his student honors at Woolwich (Eng ) last
month.
“ A deliberately charming picture of domestic
hfe at Marble Hill reaches me from the Holy City.
The Le Huntes are, it reports, still young enough
and human enough (the confirmed Vice Regal
becomes much of an automaton) to enjoy an al
fresco spree on their own, or a jaunt free of the
staff, or a snack in the house, waiting on them-
selves, he snatching out his long arm for the mar-
malade or the pickles, and she climbing round the
table to pour out second cups of tea. And S.
Australia is much pleased and edified.
“ r £ here was a smart crowd at Port Melbourne
last Tuesday to wave muslin mops at a select bevy
a Jb oa the India. Miss Thornley and her ma, Miss
Edith Smith and her ma, and several other mas
without misses, and misses without mas, were in
smart deck garb and high spirits. One or two
girls go home to certainly get married ; their
grooms are nailed. In other cases, the lasso is yet
to do its work. But there are hopes. A popular
pair, Mr. and Mrs. J. Ledingham, dressed tip to
the occasion above their fellows. The magnificent
Mr. E. L. Baillieu was farewelled by the whole
Baillieu clan—the tallest and most pictorial family
group raised in this State, The voyager goes back
to London to resume ’Change transactions.
Royal Comic charmers on this side have been
passing compliments and trophies along to Miss
Sara Hyman, who marries her old Sydney fiance
—Mr. Reggie Empson—as soon as the Bremen
can land her in London. Sara’s trousseau is the
loveliest any theatrical bride, so far as here known
has ever accumulated.
The private hospitals in and around the city
are busy binding up the charred ends of the fire-
fighters of the late bush outbreaks. Some of the
survivors are in splints. In the campaign against
the flames there were falls from scorched steeds
and all kinds of accidents. Mr. S. F. Staughton
had his leg mangled a bit at Melton. Some of the
walk the town and hang about the
clubs less an eyebrow or a beard, and with a
marked smoked-herring complexion. One town
girl who was up in the western district tells me
the scenes were inexpressibly tragic. The cries
of the scorched cattle ranged over the long smoky
distances, and sometimes in the fierce illumination
of a hill the maddened stock below could be seen
rushing to their doom.
“ The pair were rather youthful as the marry-
mg age goes. They had exchanged rings, her
name being engraven on his and his on her’s. He
sailed away. She wept on the coat-lapel of a
mutual friend. Later on she married the mutual
friend, attracted by the sympathetic nature of his
coat-lapel. Then the other came back, and re-
ceived a surprise packet containing his sweet
letters and the ring. The girl, at the same time,
asked for her ring back. He sent it—but beside
the engraven initial is the word ‘Traitress.’
That’s a foolish, a very green thing, to do. A
woman loves to be called a traitress. It implies
the power of holding and breaking hearts. It
doesn t hurt. And the man in possession will
only cherish her the more. The only other girl-
jilt case in my memory ended up differently. In
that case the deceived Romeo wired, in response
to the tearful letter granting him hia liberty, ‘ A
thousand thanks ! ’ And that did hurt. Nor did
the jilt show it to No. 2. Not much !
“Mr. M‘C. Patterson, who started a painting
of Melba some years ago and couldn’t get it
finished for want of sittings, has set to adorn a
fresh canvas with a painting of the dogmatic
diva in her pose of La Boheme before the final
curtain. Before this commission young Patterson
was away in Spain, copying cracked masterpieces
in the Prado.
“They have it that a pert typing-girl is going
to sue her lawyer-employer for breach of promise.
She has been studying the law on the point while
her deceiver has been out gadding with the other
cat.
“ The revival of a most interesting engagement
is keeping tongues on the wag. The widow
started being his fiancee quite two years ago. A
long interruption was due to meddlesome friends.
The course of true love is henceforth to run
smoothly.
“Dr. (Miss) Gertrude Halley is off by the Rhine
this week on a literary mission. Her work, she
says, will occupy a few months. The exact nature
of it is not stated.
“One of the dignitaries of the Anglican clan
gets ready for golden wedding festivities with
grateful gladness. Dean Vance has had a particu-
larly serene run of married existence with a very
amiable mate. Amiability and longevity must ruii
in her family, for on the same day another relative
—Mrs. Walter—returns thanks for her half-century
term of wedded joy. Mrs. Vance and Mrs.
Walter were two sisters married on the same day.
“Colonel Wallace and his popular wife had a
noisy send-off when leaving for the West, last
week. All the brass-and-braid brotherhood clanked
to the ship’s side, and an ear-splitting band in-
creased the confusion of noises. Colonel Wallace
goes to command the Western troops.
“Miss Tittell Brune has a passion for swim-
ming. Every morning, rehearsals-call or not,
she takes her swim. She relates herself that her
faithful companion, the lady who dashes into a
balcony or death-scene practice with a bowl of
beef-tea or a pot of milk-food and chases the star
at feeding times, dips into the briny wave first
to report whether the chill is bearable or not.
“ There is a feeling of annoyance, I hear by
private letter, that so far none of the smart Melb.
folk has been bidden to break bread with the
Hobart Vice-Regals.
“Dr. Mary Baldwin—a Melb. diploma-scorer—
after some months’ residence in a Sydney hospital,
has been farewelled by chums on her appointment
as resident medical officer to the Bowen (Q.)
Hospital.
“Two society-girls boldly set off, a month or
two back, for an extensive and independent globe-
trot. One is the popular daughter of Byron
Moore ; the other Miss Jean Robertson, a wealthy
Western mouse of a girl. They do Egypt, and
make Cairo their headquarters for a while; after
that, Paris and the Big Smoke. A Melb. dame,
who writes me this, goes on to say that the cynic
who said that ‘ Paris used to be the salon, but
now is the cafe of all Europe,’ was right. ‘ The
diner-out makes an art of her dressing and her
eating. The touriste—Yank or British—leads,
while here, a cafe existence.’
“ The one quizzical face in the heated temper-
ance throng addressed the other night by Father
Hays was that of Robert Lemon, the lead-
ing advocate and authority for the licensed
victuallers in Melbourne. The gentleman of the
fruity name is an eloquent advt. for the wine
cause, with his pink hue of health and large glow
of good humor. At weak points of the undulating
address he grinned wickedly, but at persuasive
periods looked almost sorry lie came. I was not
quite converted. The unanimous Pale Face of the
gathering impressed me too sadly. Is it a super-
fluity of tea or the iniquity of those 1 summer
beverages ’ which accounts for the Temperance
complexion ?
“ A she-starlet of a big show offered a pretty
chorus damsel the means to go and buy a pleasant
holiday. It seemed generous, but the chorus
chick sniffed knowingly, and disillusioned the
admiring. ‘ Wants me out of the way, you know,’
and she was frankly determined not to budge.
Meanwhile, the hero of this three-cornered affair
is content to let the situation develop itself.
“There is a new authority on the Voice at
large in this town—Madame Anita Sutherland,
the Chilian wife of baritone Haigh Jackson. On
taking her post as an instructress in voice culture
at the’Varsity Conservatorium (the one chaired
by Prof. Peterson), Madame has aired her opinions
to the interviewer. Strongest of all is her belief
in voice-focussing—the old Italian principle,
m which all the uncertainties of a singer’s art
are made factors of strength and the volume
increased. Against breathing from the diaphragm
the lady talks many warnings.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEHI.


NEURALGIA.
'IY'TO one under Heaven ever had Neuralgia worse than I had. It would have been absolutely impossible. It wore me down
I to a wreck, and drove me to the very verge of madness. When Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills cured me they can cure the
’ worst case of Neuralgia in this world. There’s no doubt about that.”
That is the solemn, sworn statement of Mrs. Margaret Purkis, corner of Thorne and Forsyth Streets, Newtown,
Wagga, N.S.W. And the facts prove her statement true.
“ I used to be a plump, healthy woman till my blood got out of order,” said Mrs. Purkis. “ Before long my nerves broke
down—and then the Neuralgia started. It added years to my life, and brought me down to a thin, weak, irritable wreck. For
months I hardly had a moment free from agony. For weeks I lay in bed, paralysed with pain. Fierce attacks used to come on
every little while, and I dreaded them like Death. To this day you can feel a dint in my skull, where I pressed my head by the
hour to stop my anguish.
“ For a year I hardly had my head out of flannels. But nothing did me the least good till I took Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.
The first box gave me an appetite, but it did not seem to do my Neuralgia any good. But, after the third box, every dose eased
the pain. Gradually I got back a good rich supply of blood, and began to gain in weight. Then my nerves grew strong and
steady, and the Neuralgia went for good. I have never had a pain or an ache since. None of the doctors had ever seen such a
wonderful cure. When Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills cured me, they can cure anybody.”

Master, paid N. S. W. ex-Premier Lyne a big sum
in backsneesh as the price of his appointment,
reports that it has absolutely no foundation in
fact.
Mr. Waddy, acting deputy P.M.-General
for S.A. until he or someone else is appointed to
fill Mr. Charles Todd’s shoes, is the son of the
first doctor at the Kapunda mine (where he was
born), and was educated first under Victor
Dumas, a relative of the novelist Dumas. Waddy
has been in the post and telegraph service 45
years.
THE DEAD—AND THE LIVING—IN SAFRICA.
Lord Milner denies a report that the Chinese on the Rand had built their huts an the graves of fallen
soldiers.— Daily Newspapers.
NOT ON; ONLY NEAR.
Ex-Judge Bundey (S.A.) completes his
67th year on Jan. 30. He enjoys the distinction
of being the only State pensioner in S.A.
Malcolm M'Eacharn, now in London, is
said to cultivate a curious fad—the collection of
embryos of all sorts of animals. By the way, the
rumor that he won’t come back any more to this
ungrateful country gains solidity. The other day
his carriages and silver were shipped away to
England. He is known to be feverishly anxious to
get the High Commissionership, and this settling
in London may be a move in the game.
Mrs. Bevan, wife of the woolly pastor of
Melbourne, edifies her husband’s flock during
Sunday services, looming large in her special arm-
chair in. the centre of the front row. The con-
spicuous church-chair is understood to have been
built expressly to suit its owner, who is said to be
one of the few persons who have recovered from a
broken neck. When Mrs. Bevan first arrived in
Australia she never ventured to walk except on a
level plane.
Recent mention of politicians who are, or
were, “poets,” omitted mention of half-Premier
Allan M‘Lean. In the days when he was only a
shire councillor at Maffra (the dead-beet place) he
made it a regular practice to attend concerts held
at Bringingoalong, and other such places, and fire
off small pieces of his own composing (about 200
lines or so). In more recent days he has turned
out stuff that he has not so much reason to blush
for. But if some of his Spring crop could be har-
vested now (are you listening, Mr. Lyne ?), the
Government might be upset on the question as to
which half of the Prime Ministry was best entitled
to wear the bays of the bard.
“F.”: Apropos the anniversary celebration
in commemoration of the first service by the
Church of England in Australia. As a matter of
fact, not only was Parson Johnson a Methodist,
but Parson Marsden, the second colonial chaplain,
was a Wesleyan. The first Church of England
men to arrive were William Co'wper and Richard
Cartwright, in 1809. They ought to be accounted
the founders, of the Church of England in Aus-
tralia.
South Australia’s hard-up Government
keeps its eye glued on the retiring-age line now,
and public officers are passed out as soon as they
hobble up to it. There was a great clearance a
few months back, and now T. S. OTlalloran,
S.M., is to go. There will then be left only one
of the old race of paid magistrates, got from any-
where, and appointed mainly because they were
decent, common-sensible old chaps. One was a
newspaper editor, another a squatter ; O’Halloran
was a bank-manager. The new appointees (at
reduced screws) are mostly clerks of petty sessions.
Rev. Richard Johnson, chaplain of the
early days, was given one lesson by authority,
which it might profit his successors to take to
heart. Lieutenant-Governor Grose gave 45 min-
utes for Sunday service, which Johnson did not
think enough and fancied he could extend. One
morning the 45 minutes expired while the chap-
lain was in the middle of his sermon, Grose
signalled, the drums beat, the soldiers fell into
line, and Governor, soldiers and convicts marched
ofF to the barracks. “ I felt deeply humiliated,”
said Johnson, when reporting the matter to the
home authorities.
How the savage does protrude through the
white man’s rind of civilization ! The mayor of
Geelong, the other day, startled the sleepy
autochthons of that town by bursting forth in old-
style English rags. Fifty years ago Geelong had
another mayor who had such a passion for the
“robes” that when some scoundrel prigged them
his broken-hearted worship wouldn’t mount the
Bench in the ordinary garb of civilization, but
wore improvised robes —stuck his head through a
blanket or something like that, and sported a dog-
chain around his neck. King Billy of the Merri
tribe was present in the court, and, it is alleged
immediately claimed the Bench as his long-lost
forty-second cousin.
“ D.” : Notice that The Bulletin is "being
told the yarn that Richard Seddon is going to
London as High Commissioner for M.L. in June.
When June comes along—and the following
June also comes along—Richard John Sed-
don will be still camped at the Parliament Build-
ings at Wellington, telling the leader of the
Opposition, old “Ma” Massey, that “the time is
not yet.”

Mr. F. A. Coo-
per, one of the few
survivors of the 1859
N.S.W. Legislative
Assembly, visited Par-
liament House the other
day, and scanned the
portraits of his one-time
colleagues now adorning the
vestibule. There are 79
portraits of men, of whom not more
than half-a-dozen survive. On
May, 1887, Henry Parkes gave a
dinner to the surviving members of
the first Parliament under Respon-
sible Government. There were
then 21 members still living; 12
attended the dinner —all now dead.
There is a nephew of Moses Montefiore
still living in Adelaide. He is now about 70, and
may come into a fortune any moment. Jim Hick,
the great sporting broker known to everyone
in Adelaide, used to be a crony of the present
Montefiore. Not having seen him for some time,
Dick looked him up in his bachelor quarters.
No one answering the door, he went to the
window, and, fearing his friend was ill, smashed
it and crawled through—and found Montefiore
peacefully surveying him. Latter wasn’t ill,
wasn’t even dead ; he simply didn’t want to be
disturbed.
M.H.R. Jim Page, the bulky Queensland
Laborite, has had a fairly mixed life to date. He
began as a boy in Dr. Barnardo’s school in
London, and joined Bull’s army when he grew up.
Ordered to South Africa at the time of the Zulu
war, Page saw the relief of Rorke’s Drift, and
fought at Majuba Hill. He left the army and
came to Australia. Had a considerable say in the
Queensland shearing troubles of some years back ;
and then opened a hotel at Thargomindah. To-
day Page is worth a sum that would make many a
Tory groan with envy. As a speaker, Page has
narrowly escaped being an orator.
A few years ago, upon the death of Q.
Premier T. J. Byrnes, Brisbane wept copiously
over the loss of Queensland’s noblest son, then
put its h«lnd in its pocket and ordered a statue of
the dead from Bertram Mackennal. This duly
arrived, and was unveiled in the presence
of a few dozen mourners, whose grief was
palpably on the wane. The statue was placed on
a vacant lot in front of a pub. The steps at the
base are now mostly used by recumbent drunks
fired out from the pub. It is seldom that a poli-
tician’s statue is so useful.
In a down-south city very lately a rich
man died. As a Councillor he used to have free
tram rides. In his city the passenger drops
his fare (2d. cash or a lid. ticket) into a slot. The
city councillor used to buy one dozen tickets for
Is. (id. ; he always sat near the slot; and when
anybody passed along 2d., he would pocket the
coin, and drop in a ticket. It was a ha’ penny
earned.
S.A.’spost official, Charles Todd, who is
retiring from office, was born at Islington, Eng-
land, in 1826. Entered Greenwich Observatory
when he was 15 ; left it to become assistant
astronomer at Cambridge. Later he returned to
Greenwich, whence he was sent to S.A. in 1854
as Government astronomer and superintendent of
telegraphs. At that time the only telegraph line
in the State was between Adelaide and Port
Adelaide.
Our old friend, Better-Not Wallingfcon, has

registrar of the League of Mercy. Officials and
Society hustlers will smile in irony at the honor.

stretched one decimal point by tears or supplica-
tion !
A NATURAL QUERY.
“I see they have captured the cleverest hotel
robber in Sydney.”
“ Indeed. Which hotel did he keep ?”
Federal Chief Justice Griffith delights to
wander alone in Sydney Domain in a tweed suit,
slouch hat, and (if it’s not contempt of court to
mention it) a clay pipe, when not otherwise en-
gaged upsetting N.S.W. Full Court decisions.
On these undress occasions he is sometimes asked
for a match or a chew by poor and friendless
dossers, and generally gives as requested. Justice
R. E. O’Connor favors long walks, but of a more
conventional type. Justice Barton’s favorite
exercise is talking.
From London :
Put in last Sunday at John Burns’ house in Battersea,
He promised R. S. Smvthe years ago if he went to Aus-
tralia he would give R.S. the running of him. I would
like to see him visit Australia. He is a keen-eyed, force-
ful, magnetic, impulsive speaker—a little fellow with a
big soul. He keeps in good fettle by boxing, &c., never
drinks, nor smokes, but gets a lot of fun out of life in
healthier directions. He lives in a modest way, and has a,
marvellous library.
Father Dalton, founder of Riverview Col-
lege, Sydney, who died the other day, had among
his shipmates coming to Australia Archbishop
Murphy, of Hobart, the oldest prelate on earth,
who hopes to carry his bat out for the century.
The two soggarths were so rejoiced to sight Aus-
tralia—the first land seen since passing the Welsh
coast (they came round the Cape)—that they left
unfinished a game of chess. A quarter of a cen-
tury later that game was concluded at Riverview.
Miss Jane Piper, aged 73 years, who died
at Sydney last week, was the youngest daughter
of Captain John Piper, whose name appears on
the muster roll of the N.S.W. corps in Phillip’s
day as an ensign. He was Commandant at Nor-
folk Island for a time. Piper was one of th©
founders of horse-racing in Australia.
Mr. F. B. Suttor, President of the N.S.W.
Leg. Council, advocates the erection of some last-
ing memorial to Joseph Banks. To Joseph Banks
the Suttor family owes something. May 15,1793,
Banks wrote to Under-Secretary King: —
I have met with an ingenious young man, educated as a
kitchen gardener, who wishes to marry and carry out his
wife to settle at Sydney. His character is excellent.
He will thankfully undertake the care of the garden on
board, without pay, if he is permitted to go out as other
settlers have done, and have the same indulgences when
he arrives. He will, I conclude, set up there as a market
gardener, and no doubt will become a useful inhabitant.
George Suttor thus came out, under Banks’ patron-
age, in charge of the plants on the Porpoise.
On arrival he got 200 acres at Baulkham Hills and
the labor of a couple of assigned servants. Suttor
was grateful to Banks, as shown in his steadfast
adherence to Governor Bligh, Banks’ protege,
during all the Johnston-MacArthur trouble.

Daily paper adol
“ J.” writes from N.Q. :
“ * Sagacious creatures,’ said Jingle. ‘ Dog of my
own ; out shooting-—entering enclosure. Dog stopped—
whistled, called him —wouldn’t move. Dog staring at
board ; looked up—saw inscription “ Gamekeeper has
orders to shoot all dogs found in this enclosure.” Wouldn’t
pass it; wonderful dog.’ ‘Singular circumstance,’ said
Mr. Pickwick ; * May I make a note of it ? ’ ‘ Cer-
tainly, sir.’ ” Pickwick still lives ;so does Jingle—in the
person of some Queensland nigger. In proof whereof the
following extract from an official letter of Mr. Jack
Hamilton, M.P., to the Minister for Lands :
“Last April my Maytown constituents complained to
me of the foolish tales which the blacks Protector, Dr.
Roth, was publishing as aboriginal folk-lore at the tax-
payers’ expense. At their request I visited the blacks’
camp with six whites, including two magistrates. About
60 blacks were present. An interpreter read some of Dr.
Roth’s tales in English—which most understood—and
then in their own language. The blacks said they had
never before heard those tales (which Dr. Roth said were
folk-lore of their own tribe), and suggested that the Dr.
must have been the hutt of a blackfellow or the owner of
a lively imagination.”
As a sample of Dr. Roth’s folk-lore, I quote from his
bulletin 5, page 11, tale number 32 Why crocodiles
and iguanas travel up stream in flood-time. This fact is
explained on the hypothesis that if these creatures were
to swim in an opposite direction, the force of the water is
so great that it would suddenly rush into their posterior
orifices and kill them.”
The blacks received this tale with shrieks of laughter.
And surely any white who has reached to a blackfellow’s
intelligence will do the same.
“ W.G.S.” from Maoriland :
Re curious names: I haven’t seen anything in your
paper yet to beat “ Taumataukakatangihungakawowo.”
That’s just south of Castle Point (M.L.), and quite genuine.
Others I know are Kaiteratahi, Mangataikapua, Whanga-
momona, Wainuiomata, Omaranui, Ruakokopituna.
“ Drifter ” : New Year’s Day on the Blue
Mountains (N.S.W.), a westerly wind roared and
rioted. All around the fires were fiercely stam-
peding through the gums and short, dry scrub.
It looked like the fag end of Judgment Day.
From the top of Katoomba Falls the outlook was
appalling. Across the Jamieson Valley Mount
Solitary rose up dimly through a. haze of smoke.
Towards Echo Point the Three Sisters, magnified
to a colossal size, stood out weird and spectral,
and away to the right the Orphan Rock, a rugged
phantom, towered above rolling billows of black
and yellow smoke. Flame and smoke were every-
where. I felt like a sinner standing on the outer
edge of Hell. Deep down in the Federal Pass, a
thousand feet below, stabs of red, twisted flame
shot fiercely through the heavy foliage of the tree-
tops. Along the ridge, where shrub and fern were
dry, a line of fire ran redly, like a charge of
scarlet-coated soldiers. The sun glowered through
the haze—a mere blotch of blood. Everything
appeared strange and unreal in the peculiar light.
A lighted match emitted a bluish phosphorescent
flame. Down in the gully, limbs of the gums
waved white and fantastic amidst the black rolling
smoke, suggesting human arms struggling above a
dark Sea of Despair. Intermittently the roaring
westerly wind seized the water-fall bodily, spun it
round and round and finally whirled the volume
to fine rain which drifted down on to tree fern and
bracken in the valley beneath, with all the colors
of the rainbow. Then the spirits of flame com-
menced to creep to the very edge of the tinkling
cascades. A black snake darted angrily from the
rocks; a magpie cawed dismally and sailed
away in the wind. With a last look from our
rocky shelf, which seemed like the edge of the
world facing some great mysterious Beyond, we
climbed above to the long dusty road that led to
the cool shades of the bungalow.

“Loco. II”: Be locusts, or grasshoppers,
“sticking up” trains: of all the troubles of
“sticking up,” including frost, light rains, grass-
hoppers, and caterpillars, there is nothing to be
compared to the dry star grass, which, after
seeding, drifts over the black-soil plains in Queens-
land. After a good season this grass will sweep
over the open country for miles, until obstructed
by a fence, a railway cutting, or some other
obstacle. When the wheels of the locomotive
grind it up on the rails it gets as smooth, and
almost as hard, as enamel. Almost all other
causes of “slipping” can be overcome by letting
the sand run from the sand-box of the engine,
because they are greasy or sticky enough to hold
the grit and so allow the wheels to “bite”; but
sand is of no use where this grass is. It has to be
swept off the rails before the train comes along.
Experiments were tried in Queensland some years
ago to overcome the difficulty by attaching stiff
bass brooms to the front of the engine, but with
poor results. I have known a train take half-an-
hour to go less than half-a-mile from this cause.

“J. M‘N.” : Anent sting of platypus
(8., 12/l/’O5). The sting of the male is very
poisonous. Some time back a resident of St.
Mary’s Plains (Tas.) was stung on the right wrist,
and in a few minutes the arm was double its
natural size. Intense pain followed and medical
aid was sought. The doctor stated that without
his assistance the sting would have proved fatal.
Only the male platypus possesses the stinging
weapons, which are located near the toes on the
hind feet in the form of spurs.

“ Nulla ” : The reward for killing dingoes
is well earned. Knew of one on Killongbutta
(Bathurst) which carried
a reward of £2O, but,
though some of the finest
shots in the State tried
drives, baits, traps and
spring-guns, the money was
never claimed. Omy the
callow, or debased dingo,
will touch a bait. On the
other hand, most sheep-
dogs seem to yearn for
them. The spring - gun
(generally an old and
heavily-laden Enfield, with
a string from the trigger
across the path where war-
rigal takes the night air,
spring lamb, &c.) is very
d mgerous in any but
sparsely populated locali-
ties. One week’s spring-
gun bag at Killongbutta
panned out : tiheep 11,
wallabies 7, in an 1, (wounded
in the knees), dingoes 0.
Scalp money varies, and
owing to this the wandering trapper, by borrow-
ing a scalp from, say, Emmaville, where they are
valueless, may sell it for £lO in Cassilis. The
borrower is accursed, likewise the rollling stone
gathereth no moss. Some trappers are the excep-
tions that prove the rule.

“C. Anker”: There are some pretty
hefty stevedores and lumpers in Australia, but
I’ve never seen any who would take on the jobs of
the boss stevedores at the nitrate ports of Chili.
I’ve heard legends of their prowess, but the best
I’ve actually seen is one man handling (carrying
and stacking) 1880 bags in one day. Each bag
weighs 20 Jib., and has to be carried 10 to 15 yds., and
stacked to remain fixed. I “ clocked ” him several
times during the day, and his average speed was
five per minute, or 300 bags per hour. The only
reason he stopped at 1880 bags was lack of
material and loss of time while lighters were being
brought alongside. At 5 p.m. he had not turned
a hair. There is no remarkable physical develop-
ment, and lots of Australian workers could prob-
ably get away with these men easily, but they
could not get away with the toil.

The discussion in Melbourne about the
starling and his alleged distaste for fruit in his
native Cold Country has brought out assertions as
to irregular and disgraceful habits acquired by
other importations. The skylark doesn’t dig seeds
out of beds in his own country, but in Maoriland
he’s a perfect pest that way. Foxes are seldom
considered vegetarians, but their stomachs, when
post-mortemed in Victoria, have at times yielded
green peas, blackberries, strawberries, plums,
apples, peaches, and even almonds. In fact,
imported curses seems capable of consuming
everything except the debt.
A TIMELY WARNING.
SMALL BOY : “ Better gimme that cigarette,
Mister; cigarettes’ll stop yer growin' .”
Many thousands of dead rabbits are lying
along the shores of Spencer’s Gulf (S.A.). It is
supposed that they were either drowned by an
incoming tide or went down to drink salt water
during the recent intense heat, and so perished.

According to historian Bonwick, the in-
ventor of the “damper” was William Bond, who
came out in the First Fleet. He was the first
Australian baker, and up to the time of his death
in 1839, at the alleged age of 110 years, had his
place of business in Pitt-street, Sydney.

“ Wondah” : The common opinion is that
the fish, Murray cod, was so called because it was
first caught in the Murray. But the aboriginal
name for cod is “ Murree,” and I think that the
real origin of the name arose from the mingling
of the aboriginal “Murree” and the English
“cod.”
“ J.E.W.”; Used
to think swaggying,
as known in N.B.W.
and Queensland,
didn’t exist in Wes-
tralia, but a recent
jaunt through the
southern farming dis-
trict undeceived me.
Swaggies (locally
known as “tea-and-
sugar bushrangers”)
are numerous and
fairly successful.
They have to be
pretty shifty to catch
a living, though; for
the average Groper
farmer has a rooted
aversion to giving
anything away, and
the life of the new
settlers (those whom
Hopkins’s adv t s.
mention as “making a fortune
c n the land ”) is mostly a hard
struggle for food. “ Bush-
rangers’’ sometimes work in
tennis, especially in localities
where the Gropers are rich and
mean. They find out when a
boss cocky is at home, and
swoop down on him at intervals
of half-an-hour, one by otie.
By the time the sixteenth bandit
approaches, the Groper is too
exhausted by his exeit'ons in
the cursing line to offer further
resistance, and the buccaneer is
told faintly to go to the cook
and be dash blashed. Shortly
afterwards the whole band of
bushrangers come back and in-
terview the cook. Then they
separate and move off at a siick
gait, for the Groper is probably
a .Jay-Pea, and his first act,
after returning -to consciousness,
is to send for the mounted police.
Yes, swaggying is a varied and
reasonably exciting profession in Wes-
tralia.
“ D.H.R.”: What makes many folks credit
the magpie with being the first about in the
morning is that when he wakes at dawn he
straightway begins his carol in bed, keeping it up
for sometimes an hour before he gets up and
shaves. This misleads people into thinking he is
up boiling the billy. The crow, on the other
hand, never sounds his note till he is well on the
wing. Amongst all this bird talk no one men-
tions that the kingfisher is often heard at night-
time, particularly when it is moonlight.

“Via”: Queensland, amongst other curios,
has a bullock-driver who neither drinks, smokes
nor swears. He draws timber in the rough coun-
try near Landsborough, in the Blackall Ranges.
During an acquaintance of over 20 years, writ< r
never heard him make use of a stronger expression
than “ My word, Strawberry, I’ll give it to you ! ’
He uses his lash very little, and his team is noted
for ability. Also, he sings as he plods along, and
puts in Sunday as a local preacher.

“ S.S.” : The man under the drum was a
weary wayfarer, dusty and tattered. The day
was hot and the road hard and long. Perched on
top of swaggie’s swag was a fat fox-terrier
sleeping composedly, while his master manoeu-
vred round the hotel at Emu for a drink
or drinks, strictly on the never. It woman t
work, and swaggie’s soul was sad. “Look here,
mate, I’ll give you a long beer for the dog.
“Not much; you won’t,” said swaggie emphati-
cally. “Two? ” “Not for ten.” I was touched
by the poor nomad’s love for his little dog, and
shouted him a beer sby 3. “ Why wouldn t you
take two drinks for the dog ? ” I asked him as he
w 7 as preparing to depart. “Well, fact is, boss,
said the sundowner confidentially, “I’veused him
fer a pillar so long, blank me if I can sleep withou
him now.”

NOT IN THE CONTRACT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When I lost my billet lately there was nothing else to do
But hoist a swag and hump it in pursuit of something
new ;
So I tramped a bit up country, and I kept enquiring
round
Among the blessed cookies where a day’s work might be
found,
Till I struck a job at grubbing, and I’m graftin’ at it now,
For the paddock will be wanted when live cleared it for
the plough.
The wages that I’m earning aren’t high, but I will swear
That the cocky is the whitest man I’ve met with any-
where.
Of every sort of tucker that I’ve got enough he sees,
Though that isn’t in the contract that I’ve signed for
grubbing trees.
And he says ’bout every fortnight, “ I suppose you want
some cash,”
And he gives me all I ask for, which is positively rash,
For I don’t know what I’m earning, but I’ll bet my blessed
boots,
I’ll be a lot in debt before I’ve run the surface roots.
Although I’m pretty active yet, the years I’ve put behind
Make bush work hard and heavy ; and ’most every day I
find
My spirit sort of fails me, and my face and muscles ache ;
And I somehow think this contract spells for me a big-
mistake ;
But the boss keeps on advancing any blessed tiling I
please,
Although not in the contract that I signed for grubbing
trees.
It’s frosty every morning, and my hands are cracked and
sore
(If I end this contract ever it’s a “ cert.” I’ll sign no more),
But the boss says, “ Never hurry, wait until the sun gets
higher;
Come in and take it easy, for it’s cosy by the fire.”
He is single yet and careless, and can wait till bye-aod-
bye,
And hasn’t got to worry out a crust the same as I
For a wife and sturdy youngsters ; and he only laughs at
me
When I’m cursing ’bout the tap-root of a curly old box-
tree.
But he comes and helps to cut it, and he chops it through
with ease,
Though that isn’t in the contract I have signed for
grubbing' trees.
Well, I cannot sleep for thinking; the boss at tea to
night
Was serious and silent, and seemed anything but right.
He broke a jug and fumbled, cut his finger with a knife ;
Then said : “ Your er—er—daughter has agreed to be my
wife.”
Then I “ tumbled ” pretty sudden : every time he’d been
to town
He’d called—for me—with money at my place when going
down.
There was craft behind his kindness. I won’t end that
contract now.
He must make me overseer—for his cunning—anyhow.
They’ll be married in a fortnight, so the willing maid
agrees,
And that wasn’t in the contract which I signed for
grubbing trees.

CAMPING OUT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Have you camped among the wattles
When the rain was on the road,
And the rustling leaves around you
Bedewed you with their load ?
When the scrubby reeds below you,
And the tall, white gum above,
Cast a dewy, dripping fragrance
On the camp you think you love ?
When the red-ant swarms upon you,
Near the fire you might have lit,
And a muddy hole is waiting
Wheresoe’er you choose to sit;
When mosquitoes light upon you
With a humming kind of song :
" Yes, a few of us are coming,
And the rest will not be long ” ?
You may say you love your camping,
You may say you like the road,
There are better things—far better—
Than a wactle-s rub abode.
You’ve a chu n to smoke and yarn with,
But you mostly swear at him,
While an echo curses backwards
With a litfe extra vim.
Your tobacco’s got a-soaking,
And your matches melt away,
And from pole to pole the globe seems
Just a sodden blob of clay.
Bu —Alien the fire’s a-blazing gaily,
When the billy’s on the boi l ,
And your pipe is puffing freely
While the smoke wreaths i lly coil;
With the s ar.y sky above you
And the warm, dry grass b low,
And a pleasant fellow-feeling’s
In the camp-fire’s dancing glow ;
Tin n you feel the sleepy silence
Steal within you and without,
And you like the free and quiet
Of a real fine camping out.
Or you strike an old selection
’Neath the ranges just at night,
And the old white slabs stand fiickring
In the fire’s uncertain light,
Then you wonder at their story,
While your fancy wanders free,
And the old bark roof above you
Len Is a silent sympathy.
While the big wide-open fireplace,
Where the sparks in hundreds fall,
Lends a touch of home and comfort
To the long-deserted hall.
Then the camper-out’s a poet,
While the song of Nature falls
Like a mantle o’er his fancies
From the reddened roof and walls ;
Then the camp has unversed poems,
All around it and about,
While a captive sort of something
Fills the heart of “Camper-Out.”

23 Hunter St,
“Pearler” (Broome, W.A.): I have noticed
the propensity of for
following moving vessels. I 1 p
here on the pearung
grounds we have plenty
of them. They have
the hump of curiosity
strongly developed. I
have the word of vari-
ous divers who have
told me that, when
they are on the bot-
tom, often a shark will
come circling round
them, and make him-
self obnoxious by stir-
ring up the mud, and
sometimes rubbing liis
nose up against their
bodies and trying to
tind what they are
made of. The diver
can generally seal e a
shark off by sticking
his finger in between
the rubber wristband
and his sleeve, thus
allowing a quantity of air
to shoot out, but the shark
is not always to be blurted that
way. Recently I was on a lug-
ger when the diver came up
m a hurry, with an enormous
shark following him right to
the surface; lie had been
stalking the man on the bot-
tom, and had nearly killed him
with fright by trying to bite
through the face glass of the
helmet. As the shark appeared
in no hurry to leave us, I pre-
pared a welcome for him.
Loading my Winchester, 1
told a man on the boat to
throw overboard a fish-line with
a schnapper for bait. When the
shark saw the tempting morsel he
swamup to it, and as his nose just
touched the surface I let drive. One shot
killed him. I have only heard of one diver
being killed whilst in the dress; but there
are several instances known here of divers who
have been killed or drowned on the bottom,
whose bodies have been found minus their hands.
In the old days of naked diving on this coast, the
shark became such a nuisance on the banks off
Broome that for a time work had to be suspended
at that particular spot.
“ M.H.” gives some vet. points :
Remember a back-country horse which, in rubbing'
against a haystack, was sliced from shoulder to hip by the
protruding point of a hayknife. Our cook, acting vet. /drew
the wound together with wire ligatures, and dressed with
lard. After some days, “ proud flesh ” protruded between
eacli stitch. Cook applied plain brown sugar plentifully,
and wound healed rapidly without other treatment. Have
lately treated my own foundered horse for numerous earth
sores, the result of constant lying to relieve pain in feet.
All were cured with pure wood-ashes, sifted through
muslin for freedom from grit. One obstinate patch on
the elbow developed proud flesh, and defied ash treatment.
Applied poultice of yellow soap and brown sugar through
24 hours ; removing, found deep hole. Treated with pure
carbolic, two applications, followed up by lard, and thrice
daily dustings of ash. Horse now growing spring coat
over bald patches. Sore backs, galls and chafes of all
kinds are cured’ easily by immediate and plentiful cover
ing, with the hand, of absolutely pure sifted wood ash,
winch can he kept handy without expense or much
ir üble.
HOT.
BUNG: “Hot, ain’t it?”
STRANGER : “’[?] You should jest ’ave
a little of where I come from—350deg.
in the shade (triumphantly) below
zero.”
“A.R.C.K.”: There is a black ant here
! (N.Q.) about three-eighths of an inch long;
•seems quite harmless, also short-sighted. I have
seen him repeatedly run against those
minute brown ants that take a delight in filling
up the crevices of cake. This species seems to
have a sort of police force of its own ; it’s amusing
to watch one lugging another home, not fighting,
but fair haul and tug, neither biting nor stinging
the other. When the nest is disturbed you can
«ee many of them carrying others away pick-a-
back, legs nicely tucked in and seeming to enjoy
the ride. I thought at first they were invalids ■;
disturbed a few, and found that the rider could
run as well as the fellow carrying him. Have
they a labor problem and capitalists who compel
others to carry them, and keep policemen to bring
back would-be deserters, or lumber noisy demo-
crats ?
HE FELL IN.
“I — er —never give to loafers .”
“It isn't that. The missus sent me to arst for
somethin’ off her washin’ account.”
“Nym” : Although the crow lives high,
lie is the most suspicious of epicures, and the
hardest of the bird-tribe to poison. The yellow-
crested cockatoo is close up, but is a dainty
eater and drinker. Cock-sparrow is careful of
his diet, and wary once his tribe begins to
decrease. Insectivorous birds have their special
delicacies. Night-moths are willie - wagtail’s—
hence his attention to the windward of posts, etc.
Magpies dawdle over their meals, and have
method in their gastronomic tasks, as though
afraid of dyspepsia. The eccentricities of fruit-
eating birds are most tantalising. Instead of
finishing a peach, pear, or plum, they take a
sample peck, and repeat the vandalism. Strange,
too, that where grapes grow in abundance, the
bunches are left unmolested ; where a few choice
grapes hang the lot are spoilt, especially by
sparrows. Derwent Jacks take fiendish delight
in dissecting their victims, but the laughing jack-
ass generally swallows his frogs, etc., whole.
Some birds eat one meal a day, and a good blow-
out at that; others, especially insect-hunters,
keep the machine going all day, without feeling
satisfied. The night birds generally swallow their
prey whole—such as mice, moths, lizards, frogs,
etc., but disgorge the undigested bones, skins,
etc., from their mouth. The amphibian platypus
is a dainty diner—-unlike roost of his neighbors
down under.

“ J.H.” : Yachting in Corner Inlet (Vic.),
found a rat on our boat; so we sought his life,
and he left. He was swimniing strongly for land,
when a sea-hawk spotted him, and swooped. Rat
dodged, and hawk missed, but came at him again.
Rat scored a hold on a foot of the hawk, and was
lifted several feet out of the water. He dropped
back, and the hawk came with a rush. This time
the rat got in his hold on the hawk’s beak and
dragged him under the water. They re-appeared
a few minutes after, the rat sitting on the lifeless
hawk.
An ex-Viefcorian colientingenter, now farm-
ing at Kamite, near Nairobi, S’Africa, tells of the
joys of cockeying there :
Talk of rabbits and starlings ! These pests are nothing
to those that torment us. The buck (deer) started opera-
tions by eating up our beans just as they came up, and
now the grubs have taken up the running. As soon as
the maize begins to ripen, baboons and porcupines take a
look in. A neighbor had 70 acres of wheat last season,
but the buck got in ; so he went to a lot of expense
fencing it, then zebras broke in one night, and he found a
couple of hundred among the remains of the wheat in the
morning. s
« A.L.M.H,” : “Thurla” remarks that
it is strange quail do not boom by day. They do.
Most of the quails utter a similar booming note,
and I can speak confidently of the painted quad
(Turnix varia), the commonest variety about
Sydney. I have heard this bird booming by both
day and night. The note is a soft, low “Oom,
00m, oom,” and is easily imitated by closing the
mouth and forcing the sound through the nose.
They can be called up quite easily by imitating
their note. They are slaughtered in hundreds
round Moree by alleged sportsmen from Sydney.
I know of one commercial dignitary who boasted
that he had assisted in the murder of 3000 during
a three days shoot last winter. This type of
sportsman should be given a job at the abattoirs.
“Mark Moore” : Are foxes altogether a
curse ? Some Upper Murray hillmen don t think
so. One reckons they are a God-send on rabbit-
infested hills. Thev will not touch lambs when
there were young rabbits in abundance ; conse-
quence, good lambing percentage and diminution
of bunny. He would sooner not see either rabbit
or fox ; but bunny we shall always have with us.
“Yarko”: At Whitwarta, on the V. ake-
field River (just the usual S.A. bush “town
ship ” pub.), the red gum trees grow to an enormous
size along the banks. A gale blew one of the largest
trees down; it was about 4ft. in diameter and
230 ft. high. _ When it fell we saw that it had no
tap-root, as it was growing on solid rock about a
foot below the surface. The roots covered the
face of the rock, and suddenly went downwards
at the edge. It fell just at the back of the pub.,
and the publican got a “ swaggie ” to take the job
to cut it up for a week’s food and beer. He started
cutting off the smaller branches at the top, and
worked down towards the trunk. He had got
nearly all the branches off, when the tree sud-
denly uprighted itself again, and stood as straight
as ever. The “swaggie” ran around, swearing
that he would drink no more ; but it was a fact—
not a “snake,” and the tree is standing now in
its former position. The only explanation we can
give is that the roots of the tree were very elas-
' tic, and the weight with all the branches on was
too great, but as soon as they were removed the
roots drew the tree up again.
* * * *
“T.H.A.”: A Southern squatter, owning
a station out Ingham way, when informed by his
manager of the approach of the tick, instructed
him to spread Leichhardt pine sawdust all over
the run. The run consisted of 300 square miles
and Leichhardt pine trees grow there on an aver-
age of one to every 100 square miles.

E.M.H. : “Darling how I love you, how the

in that pernicious publication the hours usually limp on

Government got manufactured goods for its £12,435,147 ?
What The Bulletin said ivas that that was all N.S. Wales
got. The Government may not have done all the im-
porting, but all the capital that arrived arrived as goods,
for all that. What didn’t arrive that way didn’t arrive
at all J.M.N. : Yarn in Haepke’s Weekly, that “a
number of scoundrelly Australian officers were hanged
for murdering Boers, and especially Boer women and
children,” is a grotesque exaggeration. No Australian
officers were hanged ; two who were shot were more or
less Australians, but not “ Australian officers” ; and even
they were n’t shot for “ murdering women and children.’

Medicus (W.A.) asks what causes alleged liquefaction of
the blood of St. Januaries at Naples on each anniversary
of his decease. The phenomenon may be caused by the
warmth of the operator’s hand affecting contents of

anything but liquid. In certain diseased conditions of
the blood, the “fibrin” is absent, and in such cases
the blood will hot coagulate. Possibly Januarius suffered

all his own way until strongman Hercules put him
to flight and restored the defunct Queen to life.
Wheeling.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
O colliery work is particularly easy, and,
I taken all in all, wheeling is, beyond doubt,
* the toughest of the lot. Many outsiders
imagine that wheeling is simply steering a horse
who knows his work; that Bluey glides round
neatly-laid turns with ease ; that check-rails pre-
vent a skip leaving the road ; that the whole road
is laid with spirit-level accuracy ; and all that
remains for the “boy ” to do is to guide the gentle
creature with his meek and child-like voice.
Now for some facts: Wheeling requires skill,
muscle, and quickness, hence the “boy” is
never under 19 and , Mom above 30. The
nature of the work is evinced by the general
reluctance of other mine employees to tackle it if
it can possibly be evaded. The refusal of the
Newcastle miners to wheel is not altogether due
to their unwillingness to perform work which
other men have refused. The fact that the miner’s
wage, when he is called upon to wheel, is fixed at
6d. per day higher than the average coal-hewing
wage throughout the district, gives some idea of
this class of labor.
Let anyone with a preconceived notion wheel a
ton skip up a dipping 75yds. bord, with greasy,
ill-laid rails, and the sparks will burn all the scales
from his eyes. Bord end-turns are not railway
points, but simply iron eastings, and, the skip
must be slewed to catch the rail or she’ll go—all
four wheels. It’s a common affair to see a wheeler’s
back red-raw with lifting skips on the road. Out
on the headings it’s pushing, grunting, squeezing,
coupling-up under a roof so low that the miner has
to kneel down to take his shirt off ; spragging up
here and unspragging there; hopping off the
limmers and slewing at the turns; keeping the
horse on the long outer side of the turns and in the
middle of the straight road, to prevent the skips
fouling; trudging at times up to the knees in
water, mud and slush ; watching the harness and
the cotter-pin, which bind the limmers to the
eockhole of the skip ; knowing that a break may
send you, the skip and the horse against the coal-
rib ; and so on, incessantly pelting back with
empties from the flat, for eight solid hours..
Under ordinary circumstances, the work is none
too safe, and the unexpected often happens—
perhaps a prop gives way ; perhaps a treacherous
“pot-bottom” drops from an apparently sound
roof. Or it may be the wheeler is breaking m a
new horse, and the 41b. safety-lamp slung round
his neck or Stuck in his belt is smoked and muddy.
In the uncertain light, he mistakes his usual
spragging-up place. Too late—brash the wooden
sprag snaps. The smoked side of the safety-lamp
is turned towards the horse. He fears this inky
darkness and the weight pressing behind him. A
shot rings out—up go the horse’s heels ; out comes
the cotter-pin ; and horse, skips and wheeler are
huddled together somewhere in the darkness.

A WHITE-WASH AUSTRALIA. AND OTHER MATTERS.


ADVERTISING AUSTRALIA. •.
It has been proposed to send
iecturers about with lantern
views to advertise our re-
sources and induce
immigration. It / __
might be done /
somewhat in /
this vein. /
LIiCTUItKK . “ Few of you, I dare say,
have ever carefully studied the map of
Australia. The face of the country is
rapidly changing.”
“Our statesmen provide posts for everybody— to lean
against pending the negotiation of another loan.’*
“ We are quite aware that
an adequate Protective tariff
would result in smoking fac-
tory chimneys, and provide
work for everybody , but we
find an array of unemployed
more picturesque than smok-
ing chimneys, as you will
readily see by comparing this
picture with the previous
one.”
“It is,' on the whole, a white man's country, but we admit a tew
individuals of a slightly colored race as an object lesson, to show what
man can do on a simple diet of rice and stale fish. ’
ADULTERATED MILK.
During the recent prosecution of dairy-
men for milk adulteration it was found
that formalin and other poisonous drugs
are commonly used as " preservatives. ”
“ There is plenty of land available for agriculture. All an intending emigrant '
wants is a few thousand pounds capital to purchase it with. If he merely wants
work—well, there’s plenty of room to look for it in,” etc.
It may not be generally
known that if poisoned
milk is hung up in
the open air for a few
minutes (and, incidentally,
the dealer with it), the
toxic properties disappear.
A drop of Sydney milk magnified.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Postmaster-General Sydney Smith merits
a good word for his efforts to reform and cheapen
the long-distance telephone system in Australia.
Helping people to talk over a distance will com-
pensate for a lot of useless near-range talking in
Parliament.
G. H. Reid told his faithful papers, last
week, in simple and plain language, his views
on the mail contract question. He denounced
“in the strongest terms” the provision (which he
is enforcing) that mail contracts shall not go to
steamship co.’s which employ colored labor. But
“he won’t break up the Government on the
point.” In short, out of a patriotic anxiety to see
G. H. Reid remain half-Pretnier, G.H.R. explains
that he is willing to sacrifice his convictions on the
mail subsidy question.
POLITICAL PHRASES ILLUSTRATED.
The Premier was so indignant at this point that he
could scarcely contain himself. — Argus deputation report.
The way the bulk of the Australian press
stands shocked at the Czar’s claim on the minds
and bodies of his subjects suggests that a little
reading of English history would be serviceable.
The Briton has done a pretty abject slave-time,
and in many respects, though the slave words have
been toned down, is still on his marrow-bones to
royalty. James the First’s statement of the case
was: “As it is atheism and blasphemy in a
creature to dispute with the Deity, it is pre-
sumption and sedition in a subject to dispute with
the King.” James spelt Deity and King with
capitals of the same size; and many of his
successor’s subjects still accept the words as
slavishly as do the peasants of the Czar.
Chamberlain, in his last Protection speech :
Which is the better for the workman—to have a loaf a
farthing dearer and plenty of money in his pocket, or a
loaf for twopence or threepence and no money to buy it
with ?
If sweated goods are to be allowed into this country
without restriction, why not the people who make them ?
Afghanistan, which at present gets a big-
subsidy yearly from John Bull as the price ot
being friendly, suggests now that, instead of the
subsidy, it should be given a seaport and a strip
of territory connecting the port with Cabul. A
very awkward request, which J. Bull will, of
course, refuse.
One of the stock lies the nigger advocate
used to build upon was the alleged “unhealthi-
ness” of North Queensland for the white race.
Now the Q. Collector of Customs, in his report on
a tour of the sugar districts, says :
At Mackay, Ayr, and other places I was informed by
white growers that the most suitable white labor they
have employed were white natives of the State who had
come from farming districts.
Reform, it is announced, has scored
another triumph—the N.S.W. two-million loan in
London has been a “ complete success.” Such a
complete success, in fact, that it’s just 29 years
since N.S.W. had to pay Cohen such heavy in-
terest in order to get him to touch the business.
Further, N.S.W. had to promise this Cohen to
repay him before the awful bills start to fall due
between 1918 and 1924.
The S.A. Labor party is making a big bid
for the city seats at the next general election. At
present they have two members (Price and Cony-
beer) for Torrens, none for Adelaide, and two
(Archibald and M‘Gillivray) for Port Adelaide.
They intend to nominate five men this year for
Torrens—which Premier Jenkins and Boss Dar-
ling, among others, represent—four for Adelaide,
and three for Port Adelaide.
What a fine self-respecting statesman Yes-
No Reid owns up to being. “ Unfortunately,” he
tells the papers, talking about the White Ocean
policy, “ when I appealed to the people to return
men of similar views to myself, a majority of the
electors did the very opposite, and returned
majorities in the two Houses opposed to my
views. ” A few months ago G. H. Reid said he
was shocked at Watson holding office, seeing that
he didn’t have an absolute majority behind him ;
it was an outrage on Constitutional Government.
And now, when he has jockeyed Watson out and
got into recess in Watson’s shoes, Reid coolly
owns to being the same sort of “outrage.” In
fact, he owns to being a worse outrage, since he
hasn’t got a majority in either House.
According to S.M. Herald :—•
Mr. G. H. Knibbs, speaking at a meeting held at North
Sydney by the local branch of the Women’s Political
Educational League, referred to the laws governing immi-
gration. He said the introduction of a desirable class of
people from every part of the world could not be regarded
as a calamity. The present state of things was a bad
omen for the future.
If the ex-Education Commissioner means yellow
people, then he doesn’t seem a desirable sort of
person to have much to do with the education of
a State whose fixed policy is White. If he doesn’t
mean yellow people, then he (or the paper for him)
has suggested more than a half falsehood about
existing immigration laws. Even a greengrocer
would know that it wouldn't spoil his trade if he
shut rotten fruit out of his shop, and got a repu-
tition for only dealing in good stuff—and that’s
all the present laws aims at.
“Edyson”: I am one of a few
thousands who would like to know the
whole inwardness of the job that has re-
sulted in the destruction of the Red Bluff,
just beyond St. Kilda (Vic.). The remains
of tho bluff are being employed to im-
prove property along the route of the pro-
posed St. Kilda to Brighton electric rail-
way. The Red Bluff was the only bit of
a break in miles of flat, dull seashore, the
only spot where the waves broke against a -
bit of headland, the one place between
Port Melbourne and Brighton that might
have been converted into a fairly pic-
turesque resort; and the Government is
busjq with an eagerness truly surprising,
cutting the headland down to the level
of the surrounding depression. The re-
moval of the bluff is a piece of stupid van-
dalism, even if the work in which the
debris is being employed is above sus-
picion.
Thus Deakin to a recent Melb.
Herald interviewer : “ Advertise, give
cheap land and cheap fares. That is the
royal road to a big Australian population.”
He does not say where the cheap land—•*
reasonably good land —is to come from,
nor does he say anything about a Federal
land tax to force the land monopolist to
throw his estates open at a fair price.
And doesn’t Deakin know that Australia
already produces more raw material than
it uses, and that it imports—because
it fails to make herself—nearly all the
manufactured goods it needs—more, in
fact, per head than any other country on
eiith ? Deakin seems to have altogether
shed his Protectionism.
Some time ago the N.S.W. Employers’
Federation was angry with the Arbitration Act
because it had proved an effective organiser for
trades unions. The other day the President
of the Employers’ Federation wrote to the dailies
to complain that the Newcastle coal wheelers are
not an industrial union registered under the Act,
and hinting some sinister motive in the abstention.
You cannot please such people, flog high or flog
low.
Bent has not allowed the employment of
spies in the railways to cease with the exploits of
the “dauntless six” of the strike days. Taking
the Melbourne Tramway Co. as a model, the
Commissioners have been persuaded to employ
“ spotters ”to travel on the suburban lines. The
result of this sneak system is the demoralisation of
a service that was already too full of disgust to
take the interest in its work which it would
under decent treatment.
In a recent article on 11 The Making of
Woollen Goods,” S.M. Herald wanted to know
“ Why” ; and in an unguarded moment let slip the
truth in answer to its own question :
The question at once arises ; Why cannot we, having
the raw material lying so abundantly at our doors, manu-
facture more of it for home use than we do ? . . . Many
of the large tailoring houses stock the local-made tweeds,
and have done so for years past; but the demand for
cheap goods is everlasting, and it is against the lower
qualities of the imported article which contain either
shoddy or cotton that the N.S.W. manufacturer cannot
compete. The Federal tariff of 15 per cent, on piece
woollen goods, and 25 per cent, on clothing, has helped
the local industry much, but it is not -deemed sufficient
when all-woollen goods are offered in competition ag-ainst
shoddy.
In other words, the bane of the N.S.W. woollen-
making industry has been that same blessed Free-
trade for which the Herald has been mumbling
incessantly all these weary years.
THE LATEST DIVORCE CASE.
“ And she had been married some years to
Frank. I thought they were quite settled
down ! By the way, was there any issue ?”
“ Oh, yes, I sec by the papers that counsel
applied to have the issue amended before the
divorce Judge the other day."
Chief Justice Way (S.A.) admits that the
anti-vermin legislation of that State is a “dead-
letter,” owing to the wording of the four Acts on
the subject being loose and self-contradictory.
Recently a farmer, who had been fined at
Quorn under one of the Acts, took the case to the
Supreme Court, and the prosecuting District
Council, advised by city lawyers, did not even
attempt to support the conviction. A simple and
intelligible consolidating Act is wanted.
In Vic. Education Department, monitors
and monitres3es are kept doing the work of pupil
teachers for years after passing their examinations
at pittances of £lO and £l2 per annum ; and the
Department, instead of endeavoring to provide a
living for all competent to teach and sending all
the rest about their business, contemplates, in the
Teachers Bill circulated last session, cutting down
even these miserable doles still further. And Fat
men, who spend more than a pupil teacher’s wage
a year in cigars, sneer about “pampered civil
servants.”
N.S.W. Governor Rawson broke out with
heated language at Kiama last week :
What was wanted was legislation to prevent scoundrels
from sending home bad butter, which ruined the trade.
(Applause.)
Not legislation, mark, to prevent scoundrels
making or selling bad butter, but to prevent the
crime of sending bad butter to Bull. Gov.
Rawson has got into the Australian habit of
thinking that anything is good enough for the
local Gibeonite; but the Israelite “ at home ”
must have the best at any cost.
Melbourne Age continues to pelt offensive
sentences at its own creature, Bent, over the delay
in opening the Kronheimer wing of the Austin
hospital. A large number of unfortunate con-
sumptives, the Age points out, are
waiting the pleasure of Mr. Bent, who, in a spirit of
callous obstinacy, declines to allow the building to be
opened ; and, to'satisfy a feeling of childish pique, turns
a deaf ear to the appeals made to him from all quarters
to retire from his indefensible position, on humanitarian
if no other grounds. Case after case has been quoted to
him, each and every one of them containing elements of
pathos that would soften the heart of any humane person.
All he does is to answer objections with bluster, pleading
with ridicule, reason with contempt.
The N.S.W. Railway Commissioners have
reported that the lowest Australian tender for 120
locomotives is £148,575 more than the
lowest foreign tender. Thereupon ,T.
Carruthers writes what the S.M. Herald
calls “a laconic minute” :
In other words, the State can buy in the open
market the engines it requires at a price which
would enable it to save sufficient money from
the local price to make a present of £4OO to each
of the 228 hands in the local works and then have
£13,350 to spare.
All that the “laconic” Premier has overlooked is
that, if the work is given to the foreigner, there
won’t be 228 (or any other number) of local work-
men to give the bonus to.
Tho other day Brisbane had one of the
picnics for which it used to be infamous, and,
appropriately, Horace Tozer was the guest. “ The
steamer headed for the bay, and cruised about
while luncheon was served.” Mr. Tozer, telling
them how badly he was needed in London, said
that “what Queensland needed was money.”
Well Mr. Tozer and his crowd had their chance.
The Q.N. Bank, which was really a branch of the
Government, got about £0,000,000 of money. And
then Mr. Tozer and his crowd made such a mess of
things that onabout £2,000.000 the bank hasn’t been
able to pay a cent of interest since, and the
other £4,000,000 it can only undertake to
payback, with'small interest, when some other
people have got the State out of the mess in which
Mr. Tozer and his crowd landed it. Also, the
Governments—chiefly the Governments* of which
Mr. Tozer was a member —borrowed so much,
and spent it so vilely, that at last they had the
Biggest Interest Bill on Earth, and didn’t know
how to pay it except by putting on a poll-tax.
And now Mr. Tozer says it’s money Queensland
wants ! Not honesty and pluck and perseverance,
but just another advance from Cohen.
Thus Brisbane Courier’s London corre-
spondent :
The strong dislike of English governing bodies of all
kinds towards “ socialistic experiments ” is seen in the
difficulty of arriving at a satisfactory method of providing
against the recurrence of distress in crowded centres
each winter. The needs of the poor are more than
usually urgent this year, and the puzzledom of the
Government and local bodies has been proportionately
intensified. The great question which they have been
pondering, and as to which they have not yet made up
their minds, is how they are to avoid engaging in any
enterprise liable to lead the working- classes into the habit-
of depending upon State or municipal aid. Enormous
works might be undertaken, such as afforestation on
moorlands in Scotland, Yorkshire, and other parts of the
country, and it ivould be quite possible lo make some oj
them commercially profitable, but “the principle of the
thing ”is too doubtful to the British mind. The creation
of such works “ might interfere with the rig'hts of private
enterprise.” . . . According to an official who administers
out-door workhouse relief, “it is no uncommon thing to
come across men who have not tasted any food for forty-
eight hours.”
The “rights” of private enterprise to keep men
48 hours without food, when there is remunerative
work which the Government might give them !
“Rights” of that sort pushed too far lead to
revolution.
The leading citizens of
Tam worth (N. S. W.)
have leagued together
to urge the Govern-
ment to resume the
Peel River Co.’s
estate for closer
settlement. The
co. represents the
absentee land-
lord curse in its
worst form.
Not only are
its sharehold-
ers resident in
England, but
its dog-in-the-
manger policy,
pursued now
for more than
a quarter of a
century, has
for all that
time been an-i
insuperable
bar to the pro-
gress of the
district. But
it’s not purchase-
money, but an effective land-tax, which is needed
to deal with this and similar absentee co.’s.
Among the Liberals that the Labor party
have decided to oppose at the S.A. elections this
year are Cummins (Stanley), who was a strong
supporter of the Kingston Government, and who
has been consistently on the democratic side ever
since; Scherk (Adelaide), who has voted with the
Labor party in practically every division for 20
years ; and Denny (Adelaide), who was Kingston’s
colleague at West Adelaide, and who has always
been in sympathy with progressive measures. It’s
bad policy.
The possibility of cotton-growing gave Aus-
tralia its first pretext for seeking the introduction
of coolies. One G. R. Mayo, in 1838, took up land
in Queensland (then Moreton Bay district) for
cotton growing, and influenced the Government
to apply to the Secretary of State for permission
to engage Indian coolies for working the planta-
tion. Lord Normanby’s reply was that the
engagement of Indian coolies for Australia was
“ in direct opposition to the policy of the British
Government.”
“Vulcan” ; In levying duty on foreign
advertising matter coming in through the post,
the Customs Dept, evidently discriminates some.
Received recently, from a London waifs’ home, an
alms-plea, which cost a halfpenny duty. Next
day brought a Yankee “ hypnotist’s ” batch with-
out any duty. Former went under the half ounce,
latter over half a pound. The American person
sternly required a “ guarantee that I shall not use
the power ne will give me [for a guinea] to cause
persons to sign wills, deeds, etc., in my favor.”
He’ll certainly rake more lucre from this stone-
broke land than all the charitable cadges com-
bined. Protection is, first, to prevent that. As
gull-protection is, of course, next to impossible,
protection of the local gull-plucking industry will
keep the money here, anyway.
A MISSING TIP.
Mr. Bent was asked if any decision had been arrived at
with reference to Mr. Taverner’s expenses incurred in re-
turning- to Victoria to defend himself against the charges
made by Mr. Sinclair. “We have agreed to pay his pas-
sage money,” replied Mr. Bent; “and that is all.”
ARGIS.
TAV. (on receiving ticket): “ Er — isn't there some
mistake ? Haven't you forgotten something? ”
BENT : “ No. I daren't do it , Ta .; but you've
had a nice little trip—and your character's
cleared."
S. Australia has just put up, at Seppelts-
lield, the largest brandy-still in Australia, and one
of the largest in the world. It took three tons of
copper to build the huge vessel, which will hold
3000 gallons ; the next largest in Australia is said
to belong to Milne and Co., an Adelaide firm, but.
there is only room for 2700 gallons to bubble in
that one. S. Australia has scores of vineyards
oidy just getting into full bearing ; yet its stock
of wine is already enormous, and is growing so
fast that there will be a pretty bad smash if it
isn’t stalled off by a vigorous brandy business.
And the brandy business gets such poor help from
the tariff, and bumps against such an extraordinary
amount of prejudice that, though it plasters itself
all over with analysts’ certificates, it finds it hard
work to struggle ahead.
IN PARLIAMENT.
(A FASTASY.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The members buzz, and the members bray,
And the members fiddle the time away ;
And the daylight dies and the lamps burn dim,
And the Devil yawns, for it wganes him
To stand on his hoofs by the chair
While the members snort and the members swear ;
And the clock ticks on, and the clock strikes throe,
And the Devil longs for Eternity.
The members laugh and the members cry,
And the Devil opens a bloodshot eye
As the clock strikes four —for the night has Had
And the members seem like the restless dead ;
Like the ghosts that yell—like the ghost 3 that Shriek—
Like the spooks that gibber amid the reek
Of a blasted world by a silent sea,
And the Devil yearns for Eternity.
The members glide and the members sneak
From the Place of Words, as the members speak ;
And the members snore and the members drea n,
And the twaddle flows in a steady stream.
But, crouched in the shadow behind the Chair,
An exhausted Devil perfumes the air
With his brimstone breath, and he smiles, for he
Has a happy dream of Eternity.
The words drip down, but he does not hear,
For he is at home in his own warm sphere.
And the Earth is still, and its life is spent,
And he is the head of a Parliament,
Where che members sit, and the members stare,
And a demon sits in the Speaker's chair.
And the time drags on, but they make no soun I,
For each of the members is gagged and bound !

Dear Sir, —For ten years I have suffered from catarrh of
the stomach, suffering- intense pain during the whole

the doctor said he could do no more for me. At this

Mr. Thomas Gibb, Assoc., R.S.M., the eminent
authority on the metallurgy of copper, recently
reported on the Tartana copper deposit, and fur-
nishes the estimate that on his working basis of
average yields of copper and silver, without select-
ing or hand-picking the oxidised ore, the annual
net profit will aggregate about £27,404. Even if
the whole of the shares in the company were
issued, this amount is equal to a net profit of 43'48
per cent, per annum on the present price, 2s. 6d.
per share. The £27,404 does not include the pro-
fits to be derived from the production of copper
by the Natural Cementation process, which is the
cheapest known method of copper production ;
nor does the estimate cited include the profits
which will assuredly result from the development
of the big lode discovered and opened up by Mr.
Gibb. Moreover, the anticipated profits from
working other valuable mines owned by this Com-
pany are excluded from the present estimate.
Production of metallic copper should commence
by the end of June or the beginning of July, 1905.
The Directors submit that Shares in Tartana,
Limited, represent a safe, sound investment—plus
mining profits.
By order of the Board.

English Law Magazine :
Why is it that the number of sentences to imprison-
ment has increased during the last three years ? In the
absence of any other cause it is exceedingly probable
that the recent Transvaal war has produced the same
effects in this country, so far as regards the increase of
crime, as Continental wars have produced on Continental
communities.
The Eight. Hours law of the State of New
York, in so far as it applies to municipalities, has
been declared unconstitutional, on the ground of
unwarrantable interference with the rights of pro-
perty and of municipalities. The decision was
given by the Court of Appeals in an action brought
by a contractor for the recovery of money with-
held by the Street Cleaning Department, on the
ground that he had violated the terms of his con-
tract by working his men for longer than eight
hours in each day. Two of the Justices held that
the Eight Hours law was unconstitutional because
of an unwarranted interference with the rights of
municipalities; three of them held that it was
bad because of an unjustifiable interference with
the rights of property; the sixth, Judge
Haight dissented on the ground that the law was
really a police regulation instituted in the interests
of morality and of public health. Viewing the
matter from a distance, it seems a straining of the
American Constitution to use it for the purpose of
permitting a contractor to evade conditions into
which he entered with his eyes open. Had the
contractor not subscribed to the conditions imposed
by the municipality, he would not have got the
contract to build six mud scows at a cost of £5750
or so. Having taken the contract from presum-
ably more honest men, the American Court of
Appeals upholds him in his career of deception—
apparently not taking into consideration that the
honest contractors who had intended to abide by
the plain terms of the contract were handicapped
in their competition with a man whose lower
prices were due to the fact that he intended from
the outset to sweat his workmen.
Mrs. E. N. WALLERINS, Vermillion, Minn.,
writes: “My little girl, Julia, was taken with a COUGH,
and at times\wa« prostrated witSi fever. JAYNE'S
EXPECTORANT CURED HER.”*
Melbourne Argus the other day flicked at
the friskiness of the early Crusaders: —
Bethlehem is an exceptionally thriving and cleanly
town for Palestine. It has a population of 8000 or 10,000
inhabitants, who are nearly all Christians, and the marks
of the Crusaders’ blood are everywhere apparent in their
blue eyes and fair hair.
Scattering blue eyes and fair hair around wasn‘ b
supposed to be in the contract of struggling for
the Holy Sepulchre.
“ A.P.It.” : Have noticed that as the half-
caste ages his expression becomes peculiarly dog-
like in repose. Mental vacuity, inertia, and sad-
eyed servility are suggested by the drooping lines
of the face. Racial exclusiveness may account for
this in some degree, and free rations no doubt
contribute to the tired tendency. Anything
ostentatious—buck-jump riding, cricket, athletics
—is his forte, but at solid toil he is a failure ;he
requires too much watching.

WHAT IS CATARRH?
fs
MEDICATOR.
CATARRH is inflammation of the
lining- membrane cf the nose and
adjoining passages. If this inflam-
mation is not arrested it invades the
passages which leads from the nose
to the head, ears, throat and lungs.
It injures the sight and hearing,
destroys the sense of taste and
smell, renders the breath offensive,
breaks down the affected tissues,
consumes the nasal cartileges, and
rots away the small frontal bones of
the skull. The putrid discharge,
passing through the lungs and
stomach, causes dyspepsia, also con-
sumption. Do you want relief and
cure ? If so, try our great, remedy.
It has no equal.

An Unmarried Woman.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
(Jive me leave to tell the. story
Of Selina and the Dude
(’Tisn’t in the category
Of the reckless or the rude).
It was Summer, and she fainted,
And they thus became acquainted ;
Ar* 1 her lovely face looked sainted
'Jo the vision of the Dude.
She recovered —pretty schemer —
Through the kindness of the Dude
(It was on a Harbor steamer,
This delightful interlude).
She was very sweet and charming,
And her fears, that seemed alarming,
He found pleasure in disarming.
“ Are you married ? ” said the Dude.
“Goodness ! No ! ” said sweet Selina,
As she beamed upon the Dude—
Whose affectionate demeanor
Showed a lover’s attitude.
“ I rejoice to say I’m single”
(Here the tears began to mingle).
“ Come and share my humble sh' i ;l.e,
For I love you ! ” said the Dude.
It was thus their troth was plighted ;
And we need not here allude
To the pleasures that delighted
Their seraphic solitude.
’Twas a very sweet excursion,
A most beautiful diversion
(Though the cost entailed exert’ou
On the purse-strings of the D.ido).
“Well, to err is only human,”
Said a comrade to the Dude ;
“ She’s the most un-married woman
In this country, I conclude !
She’s no nymph from sweet Arcady,
Her career is very shady—
Been divorced four times, that lady ! ”
“ Holy Moses ! ” said the Dude.

Mr. CHARLES J. STINE,
of Stephenson’s American Musi-
cal Comedy Company, tells of,
the benefit derived from taking
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills.
Mr. Stine has been appearing throughout
Australia and in New Zealand in “Mama's New
Husband” and “Brown’s in Town,” delighting
thousands of people. When asked how it was he
kept such fine condition physically he unhesi-
tatingly said it was because he always made it a
practice to take two or three of Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills when he felt he was beginning
to get out of sorts. He went on the principle that
an ounce of prevention was worth a pound of cure.
Mr. Stine, in his letter, says : —“For months past
I have been troubled with my liver. My mother-
in-law, in America —long before I came to
Australia —recommended me Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills, which I tried, and I tell you honestly
that after using them I feel like a different man.
They aid digestion, cleanse the stomach, and give
tone to the entire system. I always have a bottle
with me, and find them to be all that you claim
them to be. A pill or two taken once or twice a
week regulates my system perfectly, producing
sound sleep and elasticity of spirits. You may
make whatever use of this you think fit. Yours
very truly, Chas. J. Stine, Palace Theatre. ’
Many people think if some prominent man
recommends a medicine it must be all right, but
blood is the same in King and Kaiser, Prince and
Peasant, Senator and Tramp. The medicine that
will regulate the system of somebody, will regulate
the system of everybody. Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills assist in the digestion and assimilation
of food, cleansing the stomach and driving poison-
ous humors out of the blood, making it rich and
red. They are a positive and permanent cure for
all complaints arising from stomach, liver and
kidney trouble, and are a perfect blood-purifier.

SPORTING NOTIONS-
Calcutta sporting writers reckon Great Scot to
be “ stones better ” than any other racer in India, judging-
by his capture of the Viceroy’s Cup—for the second succes-
sive year—when he had done no orthodox preparation for
the race. There is now some talk of an English buyer
making a bid for the Carbine of the East, and should the
big horse be transported to the Cold Country the result
of the experiment will be peculiarly interesting. Great
Scot, from the English point of view, is not so much the
son of his medium-sized sire Lochiel as the grandson of
gigantic Prince Charlie, the famous miler, and perhaps the
fastest horse that ever was over his distance. Standing
17J hands high with a faultless galloping action,
Prince Charlie would have been the ideal racer but for his
constitutional weakness. He was touched in his wind-
lie roared like the proverbial bull. Lochiel, begotten in
England, and foaled in Maoriland, had none of the
maternal complaint, although he was hardly so brilliant
over a distance as at the sprinting game. Great Scot, his
big son, is a modern edition of grand-dad, with a first-
class Australian breathing apparatus. Striding over
Newmarket Heath, the Australian-Maori horse from India
would come as a reminder of his flying ancestor, the
wonder of the early ’7o’s, whose English-bred descendants
have done nothing to keep his memory green.

Stated that several people backed Fulminator,
winner of the last race at the Adelaide R.C. holiday
meeting, because he struck and killed a sparrow in his
preliminary, and this seemed an obvious tip for a “ dead
bird.” Totalisator div. £2O 13s. The tote was in a good
humor at the meeting. In a field of 18 for the Hurdle
Race, backers got £2B 17s. for the winner, and £5 3s. for
the second horse.
* * * *
Just before the running of last Melbourne Cup
the V.R.C. stewards discovered an elaborate mechanical
arrangement by which a person concealed under the floor
of the stewards’ room could manipulate the scales in the
weighing room above. In order to catch the caitiffs red-
handed, the discovery was kept a dark secret, and police
and detectives, disguised as honest working men, hung
round the premises day and night. But there was no
appearance of the fakirs; now nasty people are scoffing
that the V.R.C. stewards should look very close to home
if they wish to lay their hands on the ruffian.

Only 11 accepted for each of the two big events
—Challenge Stakes (6fur.) and Anniversary Handicap
(IJin.)—of Sydney Turf Club’s meeting, Saturday and
Monday last, and all sported silk. Half-a-dozen were
well-backed in the shorter race, with Mohair favorite at
4 to 1, and Fashoda and Deemster next in demand at
“fives.” Graceton, Simnel, Mimer, The Palmist, and
Atholene were others fancied. Fashoda shot to the front
at barrier-rise, and stayed there till the end. Deemster
finished full of go, and just cut Bowra out of second place
in the last stride. Mimer, Simnel, The Palmist, and
Mohair were clustered in a line with Bowra’s throat.
» • * *
Most promising youngster seen at S.T.C.
Anniversary meet was Gay Girl who made a one horse
thing of Second Nursery Handicap. Gay Girl is remark-
ably well bred—by Amberite out of Kirry. Amberite’s
successes included A. J.O. and V.R.C. Derbies and Caul-
field Cup. Kirry shares the Australasian 6 furlongs
record (1.13) with Fulminate and Cast Iron.

Result of Sydney Anniversary Handicap (l|m.)
on Monday was a big set-back for punters, who put
money on Tatterdemalion and Cato freely, latter starting
first favorite at 3to 1, and Cato at 7to 2. Metal Lace
was also heavily supported, 4 to 1 being the best obtain-
able. Lord Ullin’s Daughter (10 to 1) won by 1J lengths.
For Turf Club Handicap (ljm.), previous Saturday, Lord
Ullin’s Daughter, voted particularly choice, was heavily
backed at 6 to 4 on, and looked to be winning easily in
the straight, when Loredano tackled her, and won by a
head; but in the Anniversary Handicap Lord Ullin’s
Daughter stayed the extra quarter-mile much better than
Loredano.

A man v. horse 100yds. race in M.L. was
amusing. Vancleve gelding Colonel had to trot while a
crack local sprinter ran the distance. The nag won
easily in B|seo., but the man’s backers contended he
didn’t get a fair start, and arranged another match, with
the same result. Seeing that the horse won in BJsec. in
the first instance, and that the world’s hundred record
for a man is Duffey’s 9 3-ssee., the fatuousness of the
M.L. ped’s backers in betting on him a second time is
remarkable.

Extraordinary as was the statement published
t’other day regarding profits over recent W.A.T.C. meet,
full returns show results to have been still better. Takings
generally totalled £24,900, and expenditure was £10,270,
showing a gain of £14,270. The club never had a more
successful meeting financially, despite that stake money
topped all previous amounts by £l2OO. Growth of
W.A.T.C.’s profits is interesting : 1901-2 saw the surplus
£8514, next year it was £10,417, and last year £11,923.

A well-known Adelaide publican had a dead-set
on barmaids, and wouldn’t have one on the premises. He
had two divinities, sport and Harry. Harry was his as-
sistant, so trusted that every night at 10 the boss left him
in absolute command. Yet somehow the takings didn’t
seem in proportion to the quantity of liquor guzzled ;
wherefore the boss secretly bored a hole through from his
room over the bar, so that he could glue his eye on the till.
About 2.30 a.m. Harry, having emptied the premises,
returned with the candle and proceeded to count the
revenue. Then he ranged the coins on the bar, and in
rotation put one in his pocket and one in the lawfully
recognised cashbox. This division proceeded (the pro-
prietor was still speechless) until one solitary half-crown
remained over. “Lor’ lum’ me,” soliloquised Harry,
“ we’d better toss for it. Heads mine, tails the boss’s.”
Tail. “ Huh ; two out o’ three,” and once more the
coin spun. (Here the old man gasped.) “Tail agen.
Aw, well, he’s got more’n me, so ” But as Harry’s
hand went to his pocket, the boss, with his sporting
instinct now thoroughly aroused, fairly roared through
the ceiling—“ Strike me pink, Harry, give us a chance ; I
won it,fair enough ! ” Next morning Adelaide’s papers
contained a ten-line advertisement from a popular hotel-
keeper, who endeavored to explain that he urgently
required the services of a bar tender (female) and a cash
register. * * *
“Spring”: There was some danger of a mild
boom in scratch-pulling in Sydney, a little time back.
“Scratching” is a wild, hairy, back-straining branch of
athletics. A description of a contest may be interesting.
The two rivals take a firm seat on Mother Earth and glare
at each other over out-stretched legs. The nails in the
soles of one’s bluchers grind the nails in the soles of the
other’s bluchers. The referee places a tough stick- between
them, and bids the rivals bend over and take hold. With
a gentle strain the “holts” are tested, and then the
referee yells “ go.” The proceedings are something like
the torture of the ancient rack. The tugger’s knees crack,
the backbone seems about to break, the arms seem things
apart, the stomach and chest heave, the neck veins swell,
the ears stand up and turn red, the eyes protrude, the
mouth gapes, and finally the tongue lolls out. The lolling
tongue is an omen of failure. The boom aforesaid boomed
with much vigor and many groans at a Sydney pug-hall.
One Dave Hennessey, who owns a mighty tug, won his
heats without a sign of tongue-lolling, and threatened to
go through the brewery champions as they go through
their own beer. One night the “scratchers” turned up
outside the hall to continue the torture, but found the
scenery dark and dismal, and a caretaker person asked
“Who’s that a-knockin’ at the door?” The boom had
burst. Dave’s friends then decided that the contest
was an unholy, underhand scheme to find out how hard
he really could tug. Previous to this Dave had been
challenged for the best by some unknown marvel, and had
rushed in to accept with a large amount of coin at his
back. Now the unknown’s confident backer lies low and
says nothing and gives no address, and it dawns on Dave
that he probably met and vanquished the unknown in one
of his heats, whereupon the hidden enemy shut up the
hall and dropped all mention of that contest for a vast
sum of money, which was to have made Dave’s fortune.
Clarence Weber, thusfar, has
been the only man to resist Hacken-
schmidt successfully by means of his
strength rather than his weight. On
Monday night last week he lasted out
10 minutes against the Russian, and the
following night he kept going (mostly
on his stummick) for 15 minutes, the
reward being £1 a minute on each
occasion. These performances, coming
after his “ draw ” with Rennert and his
defeat of Moir, seem to mark Weber as
the coming man,' for although Hacken-
schmidt handicapped himself in some
decree by going through a tiring course
of muscle-tension in his Poses Plastiques
before tackling the young ’un, there was
no lack of vigor jn “ the Lion’s ” attack.
Weber’s wriggling tactics are very clever,
and it is here that hisSandowian develop-
ment of the abdominal muscles gives
him an advantage. Moreover, his leg-
strength below the knee is probably
greater than Hackensclimidt’s, which
also seems to count for a good deal when
he is lying face downwards on the mat.
When it is Weber who attempts to down
Hackenschmidt the task looks hopeless.
The champion’s superior weight and
strength are more “condensed” than
Weber’s. How is his round, muscular
back to be flattened against the floor by
a man who is both taller and lighter
than himself ? Of course, if Weber (6ft.
in his socks) keeps at the ground wrestl-
ing game with a view to championships,
he can afford to put on more bulk
than if hfe were confining himself to the “Sandow” sys-
tem of physical culture. A thick 6ft. of Weber, weighing
about 16 stone, would be fairly able to take the aggressive
against the 15-stone Hackenschmidt, who stands 5.8. But
even then the extra rotundity of the shorter man would
count as a virtue. The barrel shape is the unconquerable
shape, provided it be honestly muscular.^
“Alba”: “Micko,” the bottle shepherd,
showed me his bull-terrier last Sunday. The fight comes
off three weeks hence at the back of the Botany-road.
“ Micko ” has made some heavy bees. He is sure of his
pup, but seeing that it is its first scrap, he gave it the
muzzle-trial before putting on more cash. We adjourned
to his stable while Robbo Hicks brought his ten-guinea
terrier and a venomous-looking iron muzzle, which was
slipped on Micko’s dog. The stable-door was locked, and
Robbo sooled his pet at the gagged brute in the corner.
It was a cruelly unfair scrap, the game dog whining in its
iron trap, unable to close with or grip its well-trained
antagonist. For 50 seconds both (logs wrestled a kind of
catch-as-catch-can, until Robbo’s animal secured a paw-
hold. Then Micko took out his watch and waited for dog-
music, but the game brute bore the fiendish punishment
with set jaw and tail a-wag until the time-limit and
choke-off. Micko is healing and flexing the wounded
paw and betting heavily. A certain N.S.W. Governor
was present at a similar muzzle-fight ; he endured it
quietly for a time, and then jumped into the ring and
threatened to dust Botany with the whole gang of dog-
tormenters. .

Balmain Swimming Club went in for cheerful
variety at its carnival on Saturday last. One feature was
an inter-club cigar-and-balloon race, in which the swim-
mers, with lighted cigars in their mouths, endeavored to
blow rubber balloons over the surface of the water. If
the cigar went out, so did the competitor. S. Rohu, a
son of a snake and curio dealer, won the prize for the best
costume. He appeared as a snake-charmer, and shook
things up considerably by taking his snakes, both over
10ft- long, into the bath with him.
* * * *
Fuss made by Sydney dailies over Randwiek
and Coogee Swimming Club’s champion Hobson’s 81 and
60 yards sprints was amusing. Only at rare intervals are
those distances swum, and then not by champions. Were
Healy, Wickham, Cavill and schoolboy champion Murray
to tackle either thev would give Hobson’s performances a
bad beating. A week before Hobson was heard from
Murray traversed 66 yards in the same time (35 1-5 sec.)
that Hobson occupied in covering 6yds. less ; but because
the timekeepers who “ clocked ” Murray’s effort were not
specially appointed by the Swimming Association, his
very much faster swim is ignored, while Hobson’s is put
forward as a world’s record.
* * » »
Swimmer Keran, following up Saturday’s suc-
cess, won the Mile Premiership of the continent at Bal-
larat on Monday easilv in 24.42—55ec. slower than his
world’s best. Later, Ballarat Handicap (440 yd.) fell to
same lad, who started from scratch.
* * * *
Sydney swimmer Healy’s time (58sec.) for Aus-
tralasian' 100yds. supremacy, contested in Melbourne
Saturday, equals Dick Cavill’s world’s record, and dis-
places Australian Bishop’s figures for the distance without
a turn. Healy was erroneously credited with having per-
formed" similarly at Waverley Club’s carnival, on the 22nd
inst., but, though the watch did show 58sec., record con-
ditions were not complied with —the start wasn’t correct.
* * * *
Another record over a distance (200yds.) swum
only at long intervals was knocked out at Coogee
Aquarium baths last Week by Australian champion
Keran, who completed his task 2sec. faster than whilom
English champion Tyers’ 2.20 eleven years ago; but
there’s no great merit in the performance.
Phil Newland, the S.A. wicketkeeper, who has

novels, “Paving the Way” and “ Blood-tracks in the

North Melbourne wicket-keeper Jones per-
formed well the other day. The opposing club (Melbourne
C.C.) ran up a total of 561, but Jones was so sure that
only one bye was included in the score.

Vernon Ransford, the young left-handed bats-
man, who played so brightly for Victoria on Saturday,
seems to be about the. most finished batsman Victoria
has unearthed for a long while. And he is only a baby

A score sheet in a cricket match, showing double
figures for the whole side, including sundries, is a rarity.
Although the recent interstate match with Victoria was
the 73rd played this result has not been accomplished yet
in the whole series. Saturday nearly saw it achieved ; the
twelve totals were all doubles in the first innings of N.S.W.
except Duff’s. And Duff, about the solidest bat in the
team, was dismissed for 8.
N.S.W.-Vic. cricket match was so largely a
matter of adjournments on account of rain that many
people mistook it for a lawsuit of fat briefs and large re-
freshers. N.S.W. made a brilliant start, Hopkins and
Trumper rushing up a century before the first
hour had expired. The first rain of the match
appeared when Noble came out of the pavilion
to replace Hopkins, who had made 37 in 50min., including
six fours. Sawdust was used, and play continued. Dur-
ing lunch time the rain poured, and play was suspended
till a few minutes before 5 p.m. During an eventful
hour Trumper was stumped after having made 81 (includ-
ing nine fours and one five), Noble was caught for 65, and
Howell disappeared for 34. Four wickets down for 240.
Saturday brought delightful weather, but N.S.W. didn’t
keep up to the good start, and the Victorians got the side
out for 421.
The rock of the Victorian side was Giller.
During the two hours that remained to the Victorians
on Saturday evening he knocked up 45 not out.
Ransford pla.yed a brilliant innings, and made 62
before Cotter’s bone-breakers got him, but Giller
was there to stay, and he batted on serenely
TOPSY, a mare, [?] 37 years—the property of Mr. J.
[?]. Melbourne.
(From the painting of Mr. J. II. Waugh.)
while Armstrong played a brief, brilliant innings for 55, and
finished up the day'll3 not out. Eventually Giller was
run out, having made 125 altogether, the only century of
the match up to time of writing. The Vic. innings ended for
345. As The Bulletin goes to press N.S.W. is again at
the wickets, Trumper and Duff out for 13 and 26
respectively, and the score stands at 102 for two wickets.
As the Australian Eleven, which is playing on both
sides, is to leave Tuesday evening, the match will pro-
bably be declared a draw.
The pleasures of the automobile on a long,
straight country road are not in it with the fascinating
exhilaration of the motor launch leaping through the
foaming water at 20 knots an hour. When 16,000 or 17,000
horse-power drives a 12,000 ton passenger boat or first-
class cruiser at that speed it is delightful. But the
ponderous mass beneath takes away the thrill. To appre-
ciate fast travelling on the ocean one wants to sit in
the stern of a motor launch, and watch the green waters
in front divide and foam away snowy white in a mighty
bank on either side, till to suddenly stop would mean
being buried under hundreds of tons of ocean. The
motor launch at sea is the nearest approach to flying.
The charm of the thing is the aery lightness, and the
atmosphere of tremendous speed, the feeling of sifting on
the naked power, as it were.
Anyone who is perplexed as to what to do with
his boys should cast a discriminating eye over the banked
track. Major Taylor has not strained his calves in a race
since the night MacFarland turned dog on his share of
the pacing in the last Sydney Thousand. That’s nearly
ten months ago, and, ever since, the dusky brother has
been spending his davs whizzing round U.S.A. in an auto-
mobile. And he can'afford to do it. It pays better to be
a champion cyclist than Treasurer of the Commonwealth.
Major Taylor has definitely announced his
retirement from the cycle track. It is stated that Taylor’s
couple of seasons in Australia panned out so well that his
only riding henceforth will be in a motor-car. Taylor
named his price for another season in Australia as nothing
less than £2OOO, irrespective of prize-money.
As far as actual racing was concerned, the chief
feature of the cycling at the Melbourne A.N.A. sports
meeting was the upheaval of W. M'Donald, who origin-
ally hailed from Westralia. In the third heat of the
Gold Stakes he simply rushed over Farley and Walker.
In the final he beat Ellegaard and Morgan. The third
heat of the half-mile qualifying event saw him home first
by two lengths; likewise the Lightning Two-laps Dash.
In the Mile International Championship of Australia he
was beaten by Rutt, of Germany by half a length. To
start in five events, win four, and only miss the fifth by
half a length is a day’s work anyone might be proud of.

MacFarland and Ellegaard, after a splendid sprint
Ellegaard jumped to the front right on the line and won
by a wheel.

Melbourne’s new Exhibition Oval cycling track
is putting up a record, which will yet beat that of Syd-
ney’s George-street trams. On Saturday afternoon and
evening no less than eleven riders fell, and some of them,
including Lawson, MacFarland, and Walker, were so
badly hurt as to be laid aside for repairs. The new track
seems to he decidedly rough, and the thin racing tyres
affected by the majority of the riders punctured, and
some sensational falls resulted. MacFarland came down
twice, but the first time he was not injured in any way.
The second time he shot out of the saddle as the tyre
went pop, and Don Walker, who had his wheel, crashed
into him, fell on him, and both were badly scraped. R. W.
Morgan’s tyre next went off like a pistol, Morgan fell, and
Ivor Lawson, trailing him, rode clean over him, and then,
coming down, dislocated a finger and left most of his
clothing and a lot of his skin and hair on the track as he
swept along it. Neither Rutt nor Ellegaard fell, and the
German champion explained that their immunity was
due to the fact that they both rode with tyres about three
times as thick as the majority of the riders used. Rutt
declares that most of our riders rush over rough paths
with tyres that are only fit to glide over wooden tracks.
N.S.W. League of Wheelmen is making a
pretty exhibition of itself over the Britannia Club’s vote
of censure on the Council for whitewashing MacFarland
and the other pie-biters. The member who moved the
motion is “ suspended ” till he apologises, and the clublis
to be annihilated if it doesn’t expunge the motion from
its books. This sort of Czardom may possibly succeed
with the Britannia Club, but in a very little while it will
wipe the League out. A League which must not be criti-
cised, and punishes any remarks against itself with anni-
hilation, is too ridiculous.

Any hopes that “Snowy” Sturgeon may have
entertained of a pugilistic resurrection were utterly
smashed on Saturday night by Quigley of Pyrmont at
Sydney’s Gaiety Athletic Hall. At first Quigley, im-
pressed by the past record of the man in front of him,
was inclined to act on the defensive, and Sturgeon
attacked with something of his old-time vigor. Not until
the second round was considerably advanced did it seem
to occur to Quigley that he might do a bit of assail-
ing on his own part. After that the scrap
was willing, and both faces were, badly knocked about.
Each bout saw Quigley gain confidence, and then it
became evident that Sturgeon’s right had suffered some
damage, for it was never used to smite. From the
eleventh round the fight really consisted of a series of
savage rushes and attempts to knock-out on the part of
Sturgeon, and Quigley, standing firmly, hit straight and
hard, and sent Sturgeon reeling backwards and occa-
sionally to the boards. When the last round arrived, it
was only the terminating bell which saved Sturgeon
from being sent to sleep, for his strength was exhausted
and the man a wreck.

’Murkan middle-weight A 1 Neill and ex-Aus-
tralian middle-weight champion Soldier Jack Thompson
fought with sustained vigor and speed during an hour’s
actual battling at Sydney National S.C. last week.
Thompson attacked continuously, but Neill, cool as the
proverbial cucumber, fended and otherwise evaded —
mainly through “ smothering,” at which he is a past-
master and without an equal in Australia. Generally the
visitor out-boxed and out-manoeuvred his adversary at all
points, and never showed a mark when the last round
ended, while Thompson looked as if he had experienced
very hard usage ; yet the match was called a draw.
The fates are very much against retired
champion heavyweight pug Billy McCall. Just as it
seemed that his lame shoulder was getting right a little
light exercise brought the trouble on again almost as bad
as ever.

Remarkable boy-billiardist Fred Lindrum met
B. Teague in four games of 1200 up each at Perth (W.A.),
Saturday last, and was beaten. Teague, showing extra-
good form throughout, made 4800 to 3229—his best breaks
being 132, 117, 109, 108, and 102. Lindrum’s highest were
111, 110, 100, 99, and 91—87 of the last mentioned lot
came off the red.

The Port Jackson inter-State sailing carnival,
which started on Saturday, had weather made expressly
for the occasion. A sky of faultless blue, bright sunshine,
a fresh, steady breeze from the E. N.E., and every one of
the five boats chartered to follow the races crowded to
the waterline with passengers. In the ten-footer race lo
got away to a magnificent start, the Sydney Crescent
going to the windward and securing the lead immediately,
'l’lie lead was maintained throughout, and the only strug-
gle was forsecond place between the Queenslander Irex and
the Sydney Planet. Una and Australia capsized. Crescent
won by 30secs., and Irex beat Planet for the next place
by a second. The big event was the 14-foot champion-
ship. Queensland was represented by two boats and W es-
tralia by one. Twelve appeared to uphold Sydney’s claim to
the supremacy 7 it lias held for several years. Manoeuvring
for position on the line the liananaland boat Queenslander
collided with the Cutty Sark, and both had to retire for
repairs. So Queensland was represented only by the
Violet, which was sailed by her builder, Mr. Crouch. The
Westralian Rene made a wretched start and was soon far
to leeward. Sydney boat vessie lead away towards
Bradley’s Head, but the Queensland Violet began to eat
the wind in an amazing style, and at the lightship had
overtaken and passed Jessie. Down both sides of the
harbor, like the bifurcated tail of Donati’s comet, streamed
the two great crowds of following boats. On the run the
Queensland captain crowded on canvas in a manner which
astonished the Sydney sailors, who were dropping spin-
nakers and other things all over the water. The Violet
was splendidly handled, and from the time she headed
the Jessie at the lightship her position was never seriously
assailed.
On Monday (Anniversary Day officially) no less
than 163 sailing craft of all sorts and sizes engaged m
racing, and in spite of the gusty wind, first from the
N.W. and then the N.E., and the frequent heavy down-
pours of rain, the city seemed to have emptied itself on
to the grey, Wintry-looking water. The big P-O. liner
Britannia, all colored flag above and colored lascar below,
was flagship. There were 14 sailing races, a motor launch
contest, and nine rowing fixtures. The inter-State
contests were limited to the 14 and 10-footer
events. The Bananaland boat Queenslander, which
was injured by collision with the Cutty Sark on Saturday,
gave an exhibition of her quality by winning the 14ft.
scratch race. The Cruising Yachts’ race was a fine exhi-
bition of seamanship, as during the run about every kind
of weather was experienced. They started in a steady
nor’-easter, then something like a dead calm intervened,
then the wind blew gently from five ways at once, and
finally the boats drove home through a savage southerly
squall, the Akarana leading. The Motor Launch race was
interesting, but lacked excitement through the crowded
state of the harbor. Motor launches should always race
“ outside,” where, over a clear course, there would be
opportunity and space to show what they can really do.
« « * *
The big Anniversary Regatta decided that, as
far as Sydney Harbor is concerned, the ex-sailor is a better
man than the present Jack Tar. The championship of
Port Jackson was carried off by the Sydney Metropolitan
Fire Brigade crew (mostly ex-sailors) against the Naval
Brigade andacrew from the Wallaroo ; and the Fire Brigade
men, who were never crushed by the weight of tlieir own
modesty, are now carrying their chests very far in front
indeed. It was a long race, and the machine-iike com-
bination of the Fire Brigade men showed that they had
trained thoroughly and hard. They beat the Nava’.
Brigade by 40sec.


o
AND CHAFED SKIN CURED.
er
A Mother
Praises Zam-Buk.
PIMPLES are the worst disfigurement
the fair sex have to bear, and indi-
cate a disturbance of the functions of
the skin. Impure matter which the
skin should get rid of is allowed to remain in
the pores, the process of exhalation is inter-
rupted, the general complexion suffers, and
just where the bad matter collects, there
pimples, ulcers, and sores quickly appear. A
few applications of Zam-Buk will quickly
cleanse the pores, and enable the skin to
resume its normal functions. Mrs. E. Beaver,
of Clifford Street, Parramatta North, N.S.W.,
has proved this, and writes : —“I have found
your Zam-Buk invaluable in the house. My
daughter suffered with eruptions in the form of Pimples on her face, but since applying
Zam-Buk these have been entirely removed. My son suffers severely through the Winter
with chapped hands, but found a few applications of Zam-Buk promptly healed them.
I have also used Zam-Buk for my baby when the skin was at all chafed. In all these
cases I proved Zam-Buk all that it is claimed to be—a wonderfully soothing and healing
balm, effective alike for young and old.”

About the cheeriest news for Australia in
recent English papers is the announcement, based
on British Customs figures, that from January
to the end of November, 1904, Australia was the
only country whose wines were admitted in larger
quantity than in the first 11 months of 1903. But
Australia, which takes a long while to learn the
Bulldog taste, still stands as only a comparative
midget in the business. Bull takes nine times
more from France, and six times more from little
Portugal.
The average Chamber of Commerce beats
creation for front. Melbourne C. of C., which
mostly consists of fat importers, wants to act as a
sort of self-constituted tariff court of petty
sessions, and inquire into each ailing industry
before it is investigated by the Tariff Commission.
Presumably it would pooh-pooh the cases which
cast the worst light on the importing disease ; and
would only recommend such cases for public in-
vestigation as were not likely to conflict with
“ commercial interests.”
“ Walrick ” : Almost incredible is the dis-
tance smoke will drift in a compact body from a
fire. Was travelling once near St. George (Queens-
land), and early in the morning came upon smoke
extending in a line for miles on each side. Thought
there must be a fire near, and urged my horse
forward to try and dodge round it. Rode 27 miles
through smoke, and then came upon clear ground
again without any signs of a bush-fire. Learnt
next day from a boundary-rider that there was a
big one raging 85 miles away—the smoke had
drifted in a compact mass for over 100 miles.
Once on Darling Downs (Queensland) saw smoke
which had come over 80 miles from a fire, and was
still moving steadily and compactly forward
before a gentle breeze. Another time, up near
Moree (N.S.W.), saw volumes of smoke miles in
thickness when the nearest bush-fire was consider-
ably over 60 miles away.
T’other Sunday an Anglican curate was
driving with a companion, during a violent
thunder storm, to conduct out-back services in the
Vic. bush-fire country. They noticed a flash of
lightning fire the grass in a paddock belonging
to the wealthiest land and mortgage holder and
storekeeper in the district. With their buggy
rugs the two men rushed to the fire, and after hard
work beat it out, thus saving thousands of acres
of grass, and hundreds of pounds’ worth of
property ; and it was a very grimy curate who
turned up late to give the signal for the collection.
When passing the rich man’s store, two days
later, the curate was hailed by the great man, who
shook his paw affectionately and congratulated
him on being the messenger of Providence to save
his property. He couldn’t very well ask the young
man in black to have a taste, so he told him to
step into the store and pick out the best necktie
(value Is. 4gd., sale price). And now they say that
the grateful fatman mentioned a necktie because
he knew the curate didn’t wear any neck-frill.
S.A. is speculating widely over some wheat
just to hand from Tennant’s Creek, over 1000
miles north of Adelaide. The seed sown was only
common stuff for fowls, and it had about lin.
of rain to feed on : yet it grew to 3ft. high and
came out fair.
“C.H.R.”: Wonderful the amount of
energy gentle woman exercises when she bashes
a snake to its death. Not long ago my wife
greeted me with the news that she had killed a
monster on the road. Escorted by the whole
family I repaired to the battle field, promising to
have the gigantic reptile stuffed for the museum.
But what stuffing the animal ever possessed was
sufficiently banged out of it; the road at the fatal
spot looked as though a harrowing machine had
gone along in full blast. The remains had been
deposited on a chip for my inspection. They con-
sisted of a few scraps of skin and part of a head.
After much labor I came to the conclusion that the
serpent, when alive and well, must have measured
quite five inches in length. And for a week there
wasn’t a prouder woman than my wife in the
Commonwealth.

We sell nearly three times as many Beale Australian Pianos in Australia as
are sold by any other maker, foreign or British.
We fought for and won our right to existence against extreme opposition by
foreign agents and those amongst musical “professors” who are their willing
satellites. All that in the teeth of freetrade, falsely so-called, which admitted
pianos free and placed duties on our materials.
There are seven times as many German Pianos imported as there are of
British and American added together. But only Pianos made in the climate are
tit to stand the climate.
Our name is on every instrument, whereas on imported pianos the names are
usually of unknown foreign makers or are wholly fictitious.
We seff direct from factory to user, and thus save you two or three heavy
loadings of profit besides freight, duty and charges.
Our prices are not more than half those of the leading makers in London
itself, and the Beale Pianos are in all respects demonstrably superior. Please
examine them and trust your own eyes, ears and intelligence.
If you send your money abroad you strengthen your commer.ial and per-
haps your national enemies. If you spend it at home on an Australian piano
some of it must return to you, whilst your neighbours, anyhow, benefit. We dis-
tribute <£9oo per week—say £45,000 per year—amongst Australians. In the
Arbitration Court last month (December) in the case of the Furniture Trade
Society and A Hordern & Sons (which case would affect us under the Common
Rule) it was proved that Beale & Co.’s wages rates are higher than full union
rates. It was proved that we pay in the four branches embraced by our busi-
ness at the least ten per cent, higher than union rates, and actually up to forty
per cent, higher on the average to cabinet makers than the Court award, which is
fixed for two years. Naturally we have the best men in the trade and pay them
from double to treble the wages paid to piano workmen in Cermany. Of the
latter, at this moment, in the depth of the dread winter, thousands are on strike
in Berlin and Leipzig against their harsh conditions. The pianos imported from
Germany at £l5 (300 marks) are sold in Australia at £45. Why not obtain
real value from your own fellow-citizens and refuse to back the German sweater ?
We offer you a Beale Australian Piano, full size, “College” Model, at £39
spot cash, ten times better in every respect than the £45 German article, and
guaranted for 25 years.
Advance Australia! And the only way to advance is along the lines of
industry all the time.

are made upon Australian inventions patented throughout the World. Please
You will find that the Beale Pianos differ essentially from all others.
others have complete iron frame.
others have steel tuning-system.
others have iron i wrest-planks.
others have imperishable sounding-boards.
others have true harp-shaped scale.
others have patented panels.
others have patent hexagonal bass-strings.
others are built up of many plies.
others will stand all climates.
No firm of piano-builders in Europe calculates its own scales, designs, makes the patterns, makes its
own foundry-flasks and apparatus, moulds and casts its own iron frames.
No other firm designs, moulds, casts, machines, electroplates, and finishes its own brass and bronze work.
Even the castors (rollers), which it is impossible to buy of reliable strength and positive working, we
design and make ourselves in Australia.
We designed and built the traversing drilling machines which drill the patent iron frames each with 300
holes. We designed and built the tapping machines, with semi-automatic action, which make the screw-
threads in the patent frames.
We designed and built in our own shops the spinning-machines which turn out the patent hexagonal
bass-strings which alone can be guaranteed to remain true.
The entire installation of machinery, electrically driven, was erected by our own staff.
We have made and sold more than
Beale Pianos in Australia, and these, placed, end to end, would reach five miles.
CASH OH EASY TERMS,
REPAIRS and REPLACEHENTS.
We have all facilities at hand. All parts at all times in stock. When a
foreign piano is injured or requires restoration in any way, there are no parts ob-
tainable, for the name of the foreign makers is legion, and no importer reckons
to keep all parts in stock. When from rust, carelessness, or any cause strings in
foreign pianos have to be replaced—a frequent occurrence—no one here knows
the maker of the wire, consequently the new wire will not match or keep in tune
with the old. It cannot be helped, and buyers of foreign pianos must submit, yet
no piano-builder mixes up wires of different makers. Any restoration is and
must be a “ fake ” under such circmumstances, but the original builder can
always restore or replace as at first. Have an eye to the future and buy a Beale
Australian Piano.
TESTinONIALS.
The recommendations of travelling artists are notoriously purchasable, and
must often be dearly bought. The leading trade periodical is Music Trades of
New York, which recently, in denouncing the practice, narrated the extreme case
of an old-established organ-making firm which began the manufacture of pianos
and proceeded to buy such recommendations. It was a fatuous policy, the firm
was unable to stand the cost, its business was taken over last year by a well-
known Chicago music-house, and the name alone remains. The testimonials we
offer proceed from the generosity of the ladies and gentlemen sending them. We
could not if we would, and we would not if we could, attempt to purchase any of
them. Thousan sof people, in all walks of life, have shown us the great kind-
ness to forward their favorable opinions, founded upon actual inspection. Others,
as from Calcutta, Fiji, and New Caledonia, give their expressions as to the con-
struction of our p'anos. You cannot have stronger assurance than the verdict of
the thousands who have bought and paid for Beale Pianos.
If you are not a possible buyer yourself, you will favor us with the names of
any of your acquaintances who may be intending to purchase a piano ?
We make allowances for old pianos and supply our instruments for cash or
upon easy terms of payment. Remember, they are supplied direct from factory
to user, and are within the reach of all.
The Beale factories are fitted throughout with the most modern plant, elec-
trically lighted and driven. No patents for any parts of pianos have been taken
out in Australia from abroad, but we have many patented improvements of our
own. Hence the entire field of discovery and practice is open to us, which is not
open to any other manufacturer in the world. Foreign traders cannot rob us of
those and other advantages.
THE CHANCE OF A LIFETIME.
BEALE SEWING MACHINES
AT LESS THAN HALF-PRICE!
The ever-growing demand for BEALE AUSTRALIAN PIANOS has compelled us to largely increase the size of our factories which now cover two entire
acres of floor space. We are in consequence relinquishing the manufacture of Sewing Machines, Stands and Cabiuet-Work, which have been brought to the highest
pitch of perfection. You cannot obtain from any part of the World such beautiful woodwork, with fine marquetry inlays, the whole built up of many plies to resist
trying climates. The Machines themvelves are the latest type of Torpedo shuttle (known also as the vibrating system). They stitch backwards and forwards, and do all
embroidery and plain sewing without removing the presser-foot. No other machines have such improvements. In order to make an early clearance we have resolved to
sell at these

CLOSER SETTLEMENT ACT 1904.
MYALL CREEK ESTATE,
INVERELL DISTRICT.
NOTICE is hereby given that the Myall Creek
Estate, comprising an area of about 54,000
acres, recently purchased by the State Govern-
ment, is now, with adjacent suitable land, being
subdivided into farms, and will shortly be made
available for purchase under the provisions of the
Closer Settlement Act of 1004.
THE RAILWAY LINE from Sydney to
Inverell passes through the Estate. Special rail-
way rates minimise the cost of carriage on pro-
duce, the freight to Sydney for the chief lines of
agricultural produce being 14/- per ton. The
Estate is distant about 490 miles from Sydney,
and lies between the towns of Warialda, Bingara,
and Inverell, the respective distances from these
towns being 10, 9, and 12 miles.
SPECIAL ADVANTAGES FOR CLOSER
SETTLEMENT are afforded on the Estate.
THE CLIMATE is good and very healthy for
human beings, and for stock.
THE RAINFALL is ample, the average for
the past 23 years being inches, as against 23'54
inches for the State.
THE MYALL CREEK and its TRIBU-
TARIES traverse the area on which there are 27
wells, and water is obtainable by sinking wells
almost anywhere on the Estate.
THE SOIL is rich chocolate, or red soils of
basaltic formation on the slopes and rich black
soil on the flats and plains.
THE ESTATE is considered to offer special
facilities for MIXED FARMING, such as the
cultivation of WHEAT, MAIZE, BARLEY,
RYE, LUCERNE, POTATOES, and other root,
hay, and grain crops. AVERAGE WHEAT
YIELDS for the Myall Creek Estate for the past 10
years is 13'5 as against 9'9 for the whole State
during the same period. FOR DAIRYING,
FOR PIG AND POULTRY FARMING, FOR
ORCHARDS AND VINEYARDS, ALSO
SHEEP-FARMING on a small scale. A
DEPOSIT of 5 per cent, of the notified value of a

application.
A GUIDE FOR INTENDING SETTLERS
on the Myall Creek Estate and a pamphlet con-
taining information as to the provisions of the

cost, from any Crown Land Agent in the State, or
at the Inquiry Branch, Lands Department,
Sydney.

riage, which makes it a superior guide to the action of men and

Couples.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Iff you take a little walk around Cremorne
On a pleasant, breezy summer afternoon,
The ferny nooks, past double pathways worn,
Are filled with sweet young couples on the spoon.
If voy take your way along to Bradley’s Head,
Jfticl sit upon a large and cooling stone,
You’ll find the couples spooning there instead,
And you’ll depart and try to drown a groan.
If you journey down to the once lonesome Spit,
To find a place where you can rest alone,
On every branch and twig the couples sit,
And yet they’ve all got troubles of their own.
You cross the inlet in the gradual punt,
And sundry couples cross the inlet, too ;
And on the hill for lonesome spots you hunt,
And couples rise up and obscure the view.
Then finally you board the ferry craft,
And ponder there, and wonder why and liow
It comes that there are fourteen couples aft,
And sixteen couples crowded in the bow.

Tasmanians are putting carrier pigeons to
some practical use. The search steamer which
was despatched to look for survivors of the
Brier Holme, supposed to have been wrecked off
the most desolate and unfrequented part of the
Tasmanian coast, was supplied with several
pigeons by the Tasmanian Flying Club, one of
which was to be liberated each day with reports.

National progress is ever the best pre-
ventive of Revolution, and as D.O.L. Whisky is
the best known inducer of the soothing spirit of
wisdom, such outbursts as have been forced upon
the unfortunate vodka-drinking Russians never
occur in those happy countries where leaders and
workers alike acquire intellectual illumination
from the D.C.L. brand.*
The impudent Machine Shearers’ bogus
union proposes more colossal impudence. Having,
on a technicality, managed to get itself registered
under the Arbitration Act, it now proposes to
nominate a candidate for Mr. Sam Smith’s office
as workmen’s representative. Naturally the
thoughts of the bogus union turn to a bogus
court. But the proposal may do good. It may
show the court how necessary it is to shut out the
bogus union in the first place.
N.S.W. Political Labor Leagues opened
their annual conference this week in the Trades Hall.
Some 150 leagues and unions were represented, and
30 of the delegates were women. In a country with
such a high percentage of lunacy, it is only to be
expected that two or three leagues should give indi-
cations of eccentricity. But the conference, on the
whole, was sane enough, and silly proposals received
but scant consideration. President Riley, in open-
ing the conference, delivered a strong address,
advocating local industry, and if the conference
comes round to his views much will have been
done to further the cause of the Labor party at
next elections. Among the resolutions before
conference at the time of going to press are:
The increase of the land-tax to 2d. in the £ ; the
right of the wife to a fair share of the accumula-
tions of the married partnership ; the addition bf
a high Protective tariff to the Federal fighting
platform; the control of mines in the Common-
wealth by directors living within its bounds ; the
insurance of the lives of seamen by shipowners.
And these are all excellent ideas.

There is a goodwill item of £15,000, not, of course,
reckoned in the above as an asset. But the benefit of the
doubt is given to an item “ Improvement account, £1192.”
Indisputable assets (including furniture, from which
nothing appears to have been written off for a long while)
total £1837; sundry debtors represent another £367.
Against this there are outstanding debts, £578. The co.
(£17,500 capital) hasn’t therefore much to show for its
money.

The profit (and loss) column illustrates what a frightfully
fluctuating business this of wheat-growing and handling
is. There is, by the way, a curious entry on the receipts
side of the last profit and loss account—“ Taxation, £404.”
On its fine profit in 1902 the co. paid £4lO ; then, because
in 1903 it didn’t make any profit, it not only didn’t
pay any income-tax for that year, but actually got a
refund of £404 of the income-tax which it had paid the
previous year. This is the sort of leakage which Parlia-
ment last session passed a short Bill to stop. The Young
Milling Co.’s actual trading profit last year, after allowing
for depreciation (a none too liberal allowance), was thus
only £1938, the balance being made up of recovered
income-tax ; so that considerably more was divided than
was earned. Still, as the net profit in 1902 was at the
gaudy rate of nearly 110 per cent, on capital, while only
10 per cent, was distributed, there was some excuse for it.
Very evidently, however, it is a sudden sort of business
which calls loudly for a substantial reserve fund.

Great Western, Cobar, has been put under
option to J. Bull. Occidental, which needed the block
badly, just managed to miss the ’bus. Western had labor
exemption, which had about run out; and there was no
money to go on with. Occidental thought it saw a
chance to make a cheap deal; but, as luck would have it,
the other people wandered in at the wrong moment.

No sooner had the Broken Hill Junction resumed
work, after long idleness, than something was found
wrong with the machinery, and there is another shut-
down. The Junction, mine and plant, is a thing of shreds
and patches, and this is the sort of behavior which may
always be expected from it unless it alters greatly, lower
down.

“ The Lord loveth a cheerful lender,” was what
the Boom gang chanted in the early ’9o’s ; and the refrain
comes softly now to Bent’s ears from the pawky Ballarat
crowd who hold ground leases at Sebastopol Plateau.
“Give us £10,000,” they cry, “to test the field.” Bent
answers—“lt shall be considered.” To give this
£lO,OOO would mean that a crowd who do not put a pick
in the ground, but live on tribute exacted from the
gold won by penurious co.’s, will be specially bene-
fitted. Ballarat may want the £lO,OOO spent, to
help it shake off the sleeping sickness under which its
mining languishes; still it ought to see the way cleared
first. Those who reap ought to be the men that sow. Also
the State should see that the white-slave contract system
is brought under official oversight. But really Ballarat
ought to find the cash to test its own deep ground ; for it
is very far from being a poverty-stricken community.

Maryborough Leviathan (Vic.) is a British-
owned quartz mine, up Maryborough way. Its manager
(Nicholas) is one of the pioneer alluvial men, and, though
over 70, is sufficiently juvenile to be as progressive a
quartz miner as there is in Vic. Mine works are on a
fairly big scale, but lode is irregular and grade of quartz
poor. Therefore, last year’s work, despite cheap milling,
was a constant effort to keep from running- up an over-
draft. With 6dwt. dirt the co. would do well, but about
4dwt. seems to be the average. Hence the battling. Now
Nicholas wants to test parallel lodes. Why not poke out
some diamond drill bores ?

during 1903, and fully 50 per cent, more than were paid
in any preceding 12 months in its history. Co. has not
had a blank since 1892, when it began divs. with £5700.
Altogether the present co. has given shareholders £230,400
on a paid-up capital of £11,560, while £24,658 has been
spent on machinery. Bulk of the 15,000 tons crushed
last term came from stopes over the 1145 ft. level,
where in places the crushing dirt was 50ft. wide.
Average grade stone is under 12dwt. ; and, as costs are
kept at below 15s. per ton, steady divs. come with
delightful regularity. Co. still does public crushing when
it ought to have its battery fully employed on its own
stone. It has a shaft, south, down 500 ft., and there is
some talk about re-opening it and hauling dirt there. If
directors got the stone in sight measured up, and then
tackled the problem whether it would pay to revise their
whole scheme of work, so as to put venture on up-to-
date lines, they would do still greater justice to a very
economically managed concern. What they want to
learn is how to take a business risk.

Homeward Bound, Linton, is a “ little-go ” in
Victorian mining which was bumped out of one legal
manager’s office into another’s because it was thought to
need a toney atmosphere. Swell-like, it got into debt;
and though sixpenny calls have been made, something
further is needed to get its head quite above water. To
pay divs. it requires a shoot of stone, which is being
groped for at the No. 2 level. Some clever nurses tend
this weakling, and it would be wise of the public to let
them go on providing the sustenance.
* * * *
It would be very mucb to the point if the South
German (Maldon, Vic.) board, when expressing its con-
fidence in the mine, told on what that confidence rested.
There is no doubt the property has a history. So has the
Black Horse, the Egerton, Star of the East, and a good
many other back-numbers. Since the gold cut out under
the floor at 1600 ft., there has been plenty of quartz, but
the only gold seen has come in the shape of calls from the
pockets of shareholders.
* * * *
Tartana (N.Q.), lately favorably reported on
by Thomas Gibb, and which evidently looks to its
unissued shares to provide the necessary plant, is issuing
some figures to prove that the public ought to look
kindly upon it; and Gibb, who has a good reputation at
his back, is understood to have approved of the figures.
Gibb estimates a net annual profit of £27,404 ; and at
that rate shares at present price would show the
comfortable return of 44 per cent. In Bulletin,
January 26th, it was mentioned that Gibb’s
estimate of profit was £2O 18s. 3d. per ton of metallic
copper, less cost of carriage and realisation; this
estimate was, in fact, after allowing for cartage, &c. In
addition to the copper contents there are some silver and
gold ; of the former, probably 40oz. per ton of copper,
though the data upon which these particular figures are
arrived at are not very complete. Tartana certainly looks
much better business than it used to.

Main features of Westralian gold returns for
December were:—lncreases: 3000 z., in Fingall; 2000 z.,
Oroya; 1 ,‘Soooz., Perseverance; 5500 z., L.V. Consols;
3000 z., Associated Northern; 2000 z., North Kalgurli;
3000 z., Boulder Main Reef. Declines : 3500 z., Associated ;
5000 z., Bellevue; 4500 z., Great Boulder; 5000 z., Mt.
Morgans ; 2000 z., Princess Royal. Last is significant.
* ♦ » *
Ida H., Laverton (W.A.), paid 3d. a share on
Jan. 23, bringing W.A.’s total divs. for the month to
£218,950 against £189,536 for Jan. ’O4, and £147,160 for
Jan. ’O3. Following co.’s which were on the div. list last
year, are not likely to appear this year Associated, Mt.
Morgans, Cosmopolitan, Brown Hill Extended, W.F.
Main Reefs and Queen Margaret. Princess Royal and
L.V. Consols are doubtful.
* * * *
East Murchison United, Lawlers (W.A.), paid
its men 4s. lOd. in the £ the other day ; but it is under-
stood 8., M. & Co. will see that the balance is made up.
During last year co. made an aggregate loss of about £4OO
during five months, and a profit of £l5OO during the other
seven, net result being a profit of £llOO ; so the sudden
shutting down of mine was puzzling. It appears, how-
ever, that co. had an outstanding overdraft of £20,000.
Co. produced about 20,0000 z. of gold during the year, so
its closing down, if permanent, will make an appreciable
difference to W.A.’s output.
* * * *
Bellevue, Mfc. Sir Samuel (W.A.), in which
8., M. & Co. hold, or held, 230,000 shares, shows a serious
drop in December return, and no explanation is given.
Return for November was 16510 z. ; for December, 11320 z.
Costs have, meantime, jumped from 17s. to 19s. 4d. Yet,
at the annual meeting held in London on December 14,
shareholders were told that in future the profits would be
at least £5OOO monthly. December’s profits are returned
at £4OO. This shows how J. Bull is fooled. Shareholders
were also told that the 100,000 tons of tailings
would return £lOO,OOO profit, as the value of the
copper contents would cover all costs. It was
added : “We are expecting a telegram to say that the
chlorination plant, which is to treat the tailings, has
started running-. ” As a matter of fact, the chlorination
plant hasn’t started yet, and isn’t likely to start for some
time, if ever. Metallurgist Koehler some four years ago
began to erect a special plant to treat these refractory
tailings, and died before it was completed, and it has never
been completed. Since then all sorts of experiments have
been tried, and experts aver that chlorination, if
attempted, will prove a failure.
* * * *
Hidden Secret, Kalgoorlie, has got the new
shaft down 200 ft., and is now crosscutting for the lode.
The surveys give the lode as 30ft. away, so it should be
cut shortly. If the rich chute is proved to continue, a
fillip will be given to the north end of the field. Another
55 tons have been sent to the Fremantle smelters, assays
showing 5 to 6oz.
* * * *
Boulder Deep Levels has been sampled by
8., M. and Co., who are now in charge, and the assay
results are peculiar. For instance, they say that, at
900 ft., a distance of 385 ft. has been driven, and Morrison
lode averages Bdwt. for 7ft. wide. This same drive was
sampled for the Royal Commission after the recent
scandal, and valued at about 17dwt., and the stone
crushed proved this to be so. At 500 ft. the lode averages
lOdwt. for 6ft. 4in. wide for the 140 ft. driven. At 600 ft.
it goes 7dwt. 12gr. for 7ft. 6in. wide for a distance of 80ft.
At 700 ft., 7dwt. 12gr. for a width of 6ft. 6in., and a dis-
tance of 120 ft. The lode has not been touched at all
above 500 ft. In all only 725 ft. of driving have been done,
although the old Boulder Bonanza Co. was supposed to
have spent £40,000, and the present co. about £20,000.
The mine has been worked for eight years, and only about
1700 ft. of development—including sinking, driving and
crosscutting—done, or a little over 200 ft. a year, at
a cost of over £35 a foot. Is it any wonder that gold-
mining in W.A. has provided so many wild-cats when
money is so squandered ? There are two other known
lodes on the property, but they have never been touched.
Princess Royal North, Norseman (W.A.), has
been much puffed of late, since Princess Royal was alleged
to have cut, in a borehole, a reef 9ft. w'ide, worth 38dwt.,
at a depth of 900 ft. Manager Creer has been putting
forward a theory that the continuation of this chute will
be found in the North, and convert a wild-cat into a mine.
The gilt comes off the gingerbread when it is explained
that the bore hole is 1500 ft., or more than a quarter of a
mile, from Creer’s workings. Then the North’s deepest
workings are 380 ft., which is a long way above the 900 ft.
bore hole a quarter of a mile away. Adelaide holds the
North ; also it has owned Island Eureka, Waihi, Princess
Roval, Ivanhoe Junction, and Victory United. What a
list!
* * * *
Hannan’s Star, Kalgoorlie, after treating prac-
tically unpayable ore for a long time, showed a better
average during December, and realised a profit of nearly
£l7OO. Some good values have recently been developed
in the main lode at 675 ft., but mine continues very
patchy. A good deal of development has been done since
co. acquired more cash during the recent spurt in shares.
Some years ago, when the plant treated ore for Oroya,
the charge made was 455. a ton, and the output
was only 1600 to 1700 tons monthly. The same plant now
treats 2400 tons at a cost of 16s. —a great improvement,
especially as plant is years older. Morrison shaft has
been fitted with a new winding engine, but those who
run the mine from London have sent out a boiler with a
firebox built for burning coal. The usual style of muddle
and waste rampant on the W.A. goldfields.
* * * *
Great Boulder, Kalgoorlie, is still practically at
a standstill, so far as developments are concerned.
Edwards shaft has been hung up since the serious acci-
dent some months ago. At Hamilton shaft a little
crosscutting is being done at 1000 ft., while practically
nothing has lately been done at the main shaft at
1900 ft. In December, ’O3, the lode was cut at 1750 ft.,
but not till a year later at 1900 ft., which shows utter
want of energy and enterprise. It was said a month
or two ago that the output would be- increased in future,
but, instead of an increase, December showed a decline of
500 oz. -
* * * *
South Kalgurli (W.A.) is at last pushing on with
the erection of its remodelled, or rather new, treatment-
plant, and co. is expected to join the producers by April.
» * * *•
Associated Northern (W.A.), in spite of past
failures, intends putting down a series of vertical bores
from the 1050 ft. level. Unless something new is found,
mine will be worked out in two to three years. Fresh
makes of ore may be found in stoping, but, so far,
there is no pay ore outside the rich chute ; and
the same thing applies to the same lode oh
the Brown Hill and Oroya north block. Brown Hill
riddled its lease with bores, and also crosscut the lease
from the 1300 ft. level of Paringa without finding- pay ore.
After all this prospecting, it is very unlikely that any-
thing payable will be found at depth. Co. - is on the
outlook for a new property, and has lots of money in
hand for the purpose; but good property is very
scarce, and is quickly snapped up if holders are at ail
reasonable.

Some few months ago, at Forest Reefs, in
Twaddell’s electorate, J. Carruthers spread himself on
the subject of State batteries. A hundred 10-head bat-
teries, enabling 1000 miners to earn g-ood wages, was
J.C.’s half-promise to help the prospecting- reefer. What
is Joseph goingto do about it? Perhaps another conven-
tion is going to be held. Free passes to Svdney, free
feeds, and a picnic would be the usual proof of the Re-
former’s good faith.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Auguste Wiegand, it seems, died from appendicitis.
Emilie Melville, universally adored in Australia from
1875 to 1885, is now playing old-woman parts with the
Cincinnati Dramatic Company.
Tenor Willie Walshe, who is now married and fat, is
touring America with the “ Earl and Girl ” company. He
threatens to return to Australia. His father was a
solicitor in Melbourne in the seventies.
The Nawns, after long and successful seasons with the
Fullers in New Zealand, returned to America by the last
mailboat.
Dear Bulletin, —We desire to assure you that a state-
ment in your issue of 12th Jan., to the effect that our
lease of the ground near the Princes Bridge, Melbourne
(on which our circus building is erected), would expire in
ten months, is incorrect.—Yours, Fitzgerald Bros.
“S. Snell”: They were ever the same. In a very
tattered and musty weekly publication called The Mirror,
picked up by me the other day, I find an earnest apology
from the editor to Mr. Macready. It seems The Mtrror
had been guilty of the heinous offence of setting
Macready’s salary down at £25 per week, whereat the
great actor indignantly declared that his screw was £25 a
night. The date is August, 1840. The profession does
not alter, and Shakspeare was wrong—the pay’s the
thing.
“ E.F.” : Looking back at a line of personal-experience
lecturers who have appeared in Australia, I am struck by
the fact that the journalists among them were invariably
more earnest speakers than the “ black-and-white ” men.
The art of descriptive writing is strong in dramatic
instinct as compared with pictorial art. Twenty years
ago George Augustus Sala gave a graphically descriptive
discourse on the “ Wars, Revolutions and Tumults ” he
had known. Although there was but little of technical
elocutionary skill in his word-painting, the pictures
were full of force. Christie Murray, in his decep-
tively-titled lecture, “Making a Novelist,” told some
powerful police-court stories. Phil Robinson, despite a
thick tongue, held his audience enthralled at times by his
anecdotes of battle, murder, and sudden death in Zulu-
land and Egypt. Years after these imported journalists
came Donald Macdonald, an unaffectedly dramatic talker,
whose hard voice had some ring of passion in it. These
men were interesting. On the other hand, how dull and
mechanical were little Melton Prior (of the Illus-
trated London News) and burly, vain-glorious
Villiers, the Graphic artist! What a tea-party
kind of humorist was Harry Furniss, from London Punch !
And if they were incapable of effective monologues, what
shall be said of their bloodless successor, Captain Scott-
Harden ? The feeble army captain almost deserves to be
coupled as a “ johnnie ” lecturer with Commander Colqu-
houn, the self-satisfied naval expert from the China Seas,
who lately embarked on a Melbourne season of one con-
secutive night.
Nance O’Neil, the lady of the generous back, returns to
Sydney shortly with a new repertory ; and, let it be
hoped, a new manager. In Nance O’Neil there is a won-
derful amount of talent, perhaps something more, but
she sadly wants the tyranny of a really good manager to
wear her rough edges off.
The new Melbourne Royal is fully provided with escape
doors and fire hoses and other safety arrangements
behind the scenes. As Bert Bailey remarks —“It would
be almost impossible to burn the actors, unless they were
too drunk to get away.”
“ S.S.” : I wonder Miss Tittell Brune does not want to
play Hamlet. Usually the woman who has acted the man
on the boards wants to show up exactly the kind of man
Hamlet wasn’t. Mrs. G. B. Lewis bravely attempted it
when she was 13 stone, and sft. high. “ Oh, that
this too too solid flesh would melt 1 ” wailed the actress.
“ Hear, hear, hear 1 ” cried an unsympathetic brute in the
gallery.
“Shade”: No notice of late Belle Cole has mentioned
the fact that on her first Australasian tour she discovered
a tenor in Maoriland—Thomas M. Jackson, of Auckland,
who, after doing Australia with the contralto, went to
London.

The Cohentingenter’s Lament.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They drew a dreadful picture of the perils that
beset
Unwary British subjects that were caught within
the net
Of the Dutchman’s laws unholy; and a picture,
too, they drew
Of honest Bull a-fighting in a righteous cause and
true.
And they said that there was glory in the struggle
’gainst the Boer,
And a place in song and story for the victors in
the war.
We believed them, and the quarrel from their
point of view we scanned,
But we never thought the sequel would be Chinese
on the Rand.
We volunteered in thousands and we hurried to
the West;
We weren’t trained as soldiers but I guess we shot
our best;
And our services were valued—so the awful record
tells—
For herding helpless women in the concentration
hells.
And we helped to loot and plunder, and to burn
the homesteads, too,
And we showed the wond’ring nations what Aus-
tralian men could do.
But it never dawned upon us we were laying
waste the land
In the interests of Cohen and the Chinese on the
Rand.
And when children died in thousands ’twas but
little grief we felt,
And our bullets found the grey-beards on the
kopje and the veldt,
For beyond the haze of glory, and the smoke of
battle, we
Could see our names emblazoned in the Empire’s
history.
And we dreamed about a city fair beyond the
ocean’s foam,
Where we’d reap the hero’s laurels and a grateful
welcome home;
’Twas the tide of fortune bore us, and ’twas
glorious and grand,
Till Cohen bade us quit so that the Chow could
have the Rand.
No ! we never thought the glory would evanish
with the hour,
Or that the war was.only Cohen’s reddened track
to power,
And we never dreamt Australians would be rated
at the worth
Of loafers and of cut-throats, as the meanest crowd
on earth.
But we’re wiser now—and sorry, for our eyes are
opened wide,
And our kharkee rags remind us we have helped at
homicide;
And enslaved a gallant people, and despoiled their
fatherland
For Diamondstein and Moses and the coolies of the
Rand.
Vic,
BEN SUN.
Constantly being cabled that King Peter
of Servia is menaced by the enemies of the mur-
derers of Alexander and I)raga (who put him on
his throne, and whom he still grateful] y protects).
Peter should have taken Machiavelli’s advice, and,
once enthroned, have butchered his friends, the
regicides, to a man, pour encourager les autres.
By so doing, he would have proved himself
ingrate; but there would have been no further
talk of revolution. As the old Florentine acutely
remarked:
The most rebellious people will suffer uncomplainingly
the rule of a tyrant who has taught them that they can
gain nothing by slaying a hated prince. And this he may
only do by mercilessly avenging the murder of his pre-
decessor.
“W.M.S.”: The crow is a wary rogue,
but he is not in it with the cockatoo for real horse
sense. When a sportsman comes in sight the
crow will fly straight to his young with food. The
cocky_ knows better. If you want to catch him
exposing the domicile of his brood in that way you
must get up very early and lie low. His way is
circuitous when anyone is about, and he will make
a point of having business of an urgent character
miles from the hatchery if the breeze conveys a
hint of a man. Writer once started to cut down a
great yellow box tree, sft. in diameter and 200 ft.
high, which contained a nest of young cockatoos.
In the middle of the job the old birds came down
from a high mountain, hauled the young ones out
by the back of the neck, and carried them off to
wholly inaccessible regions. The common water
wagtail will carry away its nest (and a work of art
it is) piecemeal if you happen on it before the eggs
have been laid. After that he takes the risk.
The cocky, with his superior genius, prefers to
move the eggs if a man is seen so much as glancing
casually at the tree.

“Dear Sirs—l duly received some time
ago a bottle of Kutnow’s Powder, of which I
handed some to my friend, Professor Dr. C.
Scotti, House Surgeon of the International
Hospital here, who, acknowledging the re-
ceipt with thanks, says : ‘ I have known the
remedy about a year, and have used it in
many cases with very satisfactory success.’—
Yours truly,

The Medical Journal,
OCTOBER, 1904, SAYS :
“ The uric acid problem affords an ever-increasing interest, not
only on account of the many attempts at solution and various
theories set forth, but because of the wide field of investigation
which is opened up with the fascinating prospect of bringing to light
metabolic facts which have ever been shrouded in obscurity. We
do know, however, whence uric acid is derived, but the metabolism
produced thereby has yet to be determined. Regardless of diet, rich
and poor suffer alike from the accumulation of uric acid, which some-
times occurs without any apparent failure in health ; but more often
are the kidneys and bladder affected, and the digestive organs im-
paired ; lie :oe excessive uric acid is frequently responsible for heart-
burn, flatulence, and liver trouble. Lithia has been tried and found
useless, for when taken by the mouth it chemically combines with
the phosphates in its progress through the stomach and there forms
insoluble compounds. The best remedy we know possessing a solvent
action and eliminative properties is Kutnow’s Powder, which is
largely used by the Medical Profession and has always given the
highest satisfaction wherever it has been tried.”
IMPORTANT CAUTION I
All respectable Chemists sell Kutnow’s Powder, but there are others who,
for the sake of a little extra profit, will attempt to foist upon you some cheap
imitation of their own. It is well known that these cheap concoctions are
highly dangerous, and in the case of delicate, sensitive persons, capable of
inflicting permanent injury. Kutnow’s Powder is pure, painless, palatable,
free from sugar, and absolutely harmless. See that the fac-simile signature,
“ S. Kutnow and Co., Ld.” and the registered trade mark, “ Hirschensprung,
or Deer Leap,” are on the carton in which the bottle is packed, and also on
the label on the bottle. This signature and trade mark will alone insure your
obtaining the
NERVOUS HEADACHES
How is nervous Headache brought on ?
Principally by the retention of the excessive
uric acid, which is a terrible scourge to the
nervous system.
How is this uric acid headache distinguished ?
When it is due to uric acid poisoning, it is
generally one-sided or partial, as over the
brow, and more or less intermittent pain
on pressure o? the scalp, and darting or
shooting pains from temple to temple.
Is uric acid dangerous ?
Not immediately so ; it is very insidious, but
ultimately, if not checked, its ravages are
disastrous.
Is nervous Headache a first sign of uric acid
poisoning ?
Yes ! when the uric acid is absorbed by the
blood it is rapidly circulated and deposited
in the nerve centres, notably the spine
and brain.
Is uric acid productive of disease 1
To its baneful influence may be ascribed in-
numerable ailments, amongst which are
Rheumatism, Neuralgia, Insomnia, Melan-
cholia, Gout, Sciatica, Enfeebled Brain
and Suicidal Tendency.
What is the proper treatment ?
Kutnow’s Powder not only removes the
headache, but concurrently invigorates the
nerve centres and expels the cause of
the trouble.
Is the action of Kutnow’s speedy ?
Yes, it will remove headache within 20 or 30
minutes.

NERVOUS PROSTRATION.
A Remarkable Cure in Redfern.
The Case of Mrs. M. J. BUDD.
(By a Special Reporter.)
The ti me lias arrived when, it is im-
perative that the afflicted members of
the community should take steps to
protect themselves against the evils
which tend to render their lives un-
happy ; and as so many go on suffering
year after year through lack of ser-
viceable information, it is deemed ad-
visable to place before the public the
story of Mrs. Mary Jane Budd, of 08
Young-street, Redfern, so that a salu-
tary lesson may be learned. What Mrs.
Budd said to our special was this
“It is now eight years since my hus-
band died, a calamity that took place
when we had been living in this house
nine years, so you see I havo been re-
Bidircr here a good while."
“Yes," assented the reporter. JL be-
lieve you are an old resident of these
“i was born in Bourke street, and
have lived in this locality all my life.
But to go back to my story. Jt was
not long after my great bereavement
that I became a total wreck, the blow
nearly killed me, and for a good while
I was really stupefied with grief, A 1 or
some considerable time my memory
was completely lost, and it was im-
possible for me to concentrate my
mind for a few minutes upon any sub-
ject. When my dazed condition passed
away it was then that I realised how
terribly my whole system had suffered,
a fret which dawned upon me as I
stood at the table one day feeling so
ill that I did not think I would live
till the morrow. For my owij part I
did not care what happened, but I
thought of my three little children,
and said to myself : ‘Oh, God ! What
ever can I take to do me good for
their sakes V ” . ,
“Was that the first time you thought
of taking anything '?"
“It was the first time I thought of
'acting on my own judgment, the rea-
son being that 1 was under a doctor
for some length of time, and his treat-
ment hadn’t benefited me In the
“What did your medical attendant
say was wrong with you ?”
“He told me I had taken my afflic-
tions inwardly, and that my nervous
system was in a very weak state. I
knew that well enough, unfortunately,
for T could not even bear to hear the
children talking, their voices got on my
nerves so, and if a tap came to the
door I nearly fainted with fright. I
hadn't the least desire for food, and I
think one of my greatest afflictions
was my inability to get to sleep. For
four years I did" not know_ what it was
to shep properly for one lt was
usual for me to remain awake till
about three or four o’clock in the
morning, and then doze off till half-
past five, when I always awoke with a
start, and would get no more sleep
till next morning. And the dreams I
had each time I slept—they were aw-
ful. But my mind w'as always distort-
ed with hideous fancies for that mat-
ter. When I put the light out at
night, 1 imagined I could see some-
body sitting on a chair in front of
me." The form would then stealthily
approach me, and for a time I could
neither speak or move. After a great
struggle, however, I would manage to
gasp, ‘Who’s there ?’ and whilst I lay
theie awaiting an answer mv feelings
of pent-up terror were dreadful. Many
of the neighbours could tell you how
often I have mentioned to them the
things I imagined I could see, and
how, when I thought somebody was
sitting by my side, I screamed aloud
for help. And after those frights I
was very bad indeed—so exhausted
that T could scarcely move { in fact."
“You must have lost weight during
your illness ?"
"Oh ! I was ghastly. My Bones
we e almost protruding through my
skin, and anybody seeing me could
not have thought otherwise than that -
I would never get better again. [
really thought I was doomed to die,
and feel sure I would have been dead
long ago only for Clements Tome,
which was the last medicine of a.l
that I took. A friend often used tj
say, ‘Why don’t you try some Clem-
ents Tonic ?’ but I always postponed
doing so ; but at last I thought that
as I had heard so much about it, and
nothing else could do me any good, l
would give Clements Tonic a trial.
This was the decision that I came to
the day that I stood at the table
feeling that I could not last another
twenty-four hours, so what better rea-
son than that could I have for say’Ug
that Clements Tonic saved my life ?
You must understand that I was quite
incapable of doing any work, and that
it was a common thing for me to ha
in bed a fortnight at a time, utteily
unable to attend to anything that re-
quired seeing to, so when Clements
Tonic began to put a little life and
strength into me vou can imagine how
thankful I was for it. And weren't
the neighbours surprised to hear teat
1 had taken a turn for the better ?
My word, it was a matter that aston-
ished nearly the whole of Redfern. But
what a relief it was to have my head-
aches ease off after so long
with them ! , And wasn’t I glad to
feel that Clements Tonic was also do-
ing good to my nervous system t
\Vhy, I had only been taking that
remedy a few weeks when I could stand
noises of any kind without wincing,
and already I was getting more sleep
than I had had for years."
"Did you feel moia refreshed after it
than formerly ?”
"Oh ! yes ; much. The reason why,
T suppose, was that I did not dream
at all, so both my brain and body
were resting all the time, and when I
awoke I felt so fresh, and light-heart-
ed —no nasty taste in the mouth es
before, a clean tongue, and, my word,
what an appetite for breakfast I had !
Clements Tonic did make me eat and
no mistake, and my nerves were get-
ting stronger and stronger as the days
went by. Eventually my old fears
and imaginations died right away,
nothing ever troubling me,. and a:l
this wonderful change was entirely due
to Clements Tonic. Oh ! I have
thanked God thousands of times that
1 was guided to tako that remedy, and
1 am so anxious that other sufferers
may regain hope by hearing of my
cure. But Clements Tonic served me
well in other ways. It put an end \o
the giddv feelings I used to have, io-
moved the swollen feeling from my
eyes and the suffocating sensations
from my chest, then, finally, built up
my strength so perfectly that every-
one could see my health was thor-
oughly regained."
"May 1 “publish your remarks ?"
"I gladly give you permission to
publish them in any way.”

who for two years suffered from Chronic Bronchial
Catarrh. I could never leave him away from me a night

breeze after a hot day, or cold blowing wind, would con-

and used different patent medicines, but without success,
until I got one small bottle of your Bronchitis Cure,
which has freed him completely from the Catarrh. Since
then he has been out in damp weather to school, and goes
about like any other child ; in fact, he seems to have lost
a big burden, and is quite well. Will you please accept
my gratitude.—Believe me, yours gratefully,

CONSUMPTION.
Too ill to leave his bed.
A complete cure,
Mr. W. G. Hearne.
Dear Sir, —I am writing to tell you about the wonderful
cure your medicine has effected in my case. About three
years ago I began to cough. At first the cough was not
severe, but it gradually got worse, and I became very
weak and troubled with night sweats, pain in my chest,
and great quantities ef phlegm. On several occasions
there was blood in the expectorated matter. I had been
treated by a doctor, whe pronounced my case to be con-
sumption, and various other treatments had been tried,
but without benefit. It was at this stage that I heard of
your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for a course of the
medicine. When it arrived, I was too ill to leave my bed,
but I coriimenced taking it at once, and gradually im-
proved. I am glad to say that the two lots of medicine
you sent have effected a complete cure, for which accept
my very best thanks.—Yours gratefully,

Letters.
From W. H. M'Glew, E q., J.P., Springside, Smith’s Mill, W.A., 11th November, 1903:
“Seventeen years ago I was suffering with Bright’s Disease of the kidneys. I was treated by two
doctors, and by them was given up as incurable. They had been attending me for some time, and
finally decided that it was impossible for me to recover, and told me that I must prepare for the worst.
The announcement came as a great shock to me, and more so to my wife and family, who were greatly
distressed. At that time my head and body were in an alarming state, being swollen right up to the
eyes. 1 had a vague feeling of unrest and tenderness in the kidneys; I suffered from extreme wakefulness,
and gradual failure of strength also, as I was not able to keep anything on my stomach.
The fact that I am alive to-day is, however, proof that doctors are not always
correct when they tell you you are going to die. I did not give up hope- myself,
and was determined : to live as long as possible. Providentially, about this time, one of. Warner’s
Safe Cure pamphlets was placed in my hands, and in it I read a letter from someone who had
suffered from the same complaint, and had been cured by taking Warner’s Safe Cure. lat once
decided that, as the doctors said they could do no more for me, I would give Warner’s Safe Cure a
trial and see if that would do me any good. I sent immediately for a supply of Warner’s
Safe Cure and a vial of Warner’s Safe Pills, and commenced taking these medicines
without delay, keeping strictly to the diet rules given, which I believe to be the most
important, in order that the medicine may do its work without hindrance. I did not at
first inform the doctors that I was taking Warner’s Safe Cure, for fear that they might
object to my doing so. After taking a few bottles I began to feel better, and this gave me faith to
continue. The swelling in my head and body went down gradually, and other distressing ailments
were greatly relieved. I continued to improve in health, gaining strength each day. The doctors were
delighted at my rapid and almost miraculous recovery, but when I informed them what medicine
had produced the result, they would scarcely believe me. In a few more weeks I had quite recovered
my normal strength, and have since had no return of the complaint, and am in as good health to-day
as ever I was in my life. To prove that this is so, agents for Insurance Companies have offered to
insure my life for any amount.”
From Mr. R. W. Eames, Blacksmith, Port Pirie, S.A., Ist December, 1903.
“About twelve years ago I was very ill with Bright’s Disease of the Kidneys. My case was
given up as hopeless by two doctors who said I had but three months to live. I went blind, and
dropsy set in so badly that the doctors said there was no cure for me. I had no sleep for six weeks,
and a most terrible headache. I took one bottle of Warner’s Safe Nervine which stopped the head-
ache. I then started to take Warner’s Safe Cure and Pills, laying the doctor’s medicine aside. Very
Boon I was able to get up, my eyesight gradually returned, and the dropsy left me as I gained in
strength. The doctors had forlndden me to work at my trade (blacksmith), but I have since worked
for years at that trade at the Proprietary Co.’s Smelters here, and have also passed for life insurance,
without being loaded, after stating what had been the matter with me and no trhce of the disease
being found. I resided at Saddleworth at the time of my illness, and many people there would
remember my case. I have reeommended your valuable medicine, or death saving remedy, to a great
number of people, some of whom have travelled many miles to hear details of my case.”
From Mrs. Ellen Judkin3, Glenhuntly-road, Glenhuntly, Vic., 29th August, 1903.
“For many years I was suffering with kidney complaint, having pains in my back and under my
shoulder blade, so severe that I could scarely stand to do my household work, and sometimes at
night the pain was so great that I could not turn over or move my limbs. I tried many advertised
remedies for kidney complaint and also change of climate, but could get no relief. At last I was
advised to try "Warner’s Safe Cure, and after taking a few bottles, I was relieved from all pain.
The medicine seemed to put new life and vigor into me. I can now work and sleep well, and am
in the best of health. My husband was a great sufferer from gravel. He consulted a doctor, who
was honest enough to tell him it was no use taking his money, as he, the doctor, could do nothing
for him. lie then commenced to take Warner’s Safe Cure, and experienced relief almost imme-
diately. After taking a few bottles he was quite relieved from that painful complaint.”
From Mrs. V. Williams, 50 Howe Creseent, Albert Park, Vic., 7th January, 1904
“ For many years I suffered greatly from intense pain in the small of the back and under the
shoulder blades, I had spells of jumping and fluttering of the heart, which caused me great anxh ty
and depression. One day, in one of vour pamplets, I read statements of some remarka le dues
effected by Warner’s Safe Cure, so I bought two bottles of that medicine, and a vial of Warner's .~> ne
Pills, and commenced taking the Safe Cure regularly, and one pill on going to bed. I could feel
almost immediately that there was a change for the better taking place in my system. Before I had
finished the second bottle I was hee from pain and dizzy spells and in good health. I have heard of
many others who have taken Warner’s Safe Cure with good result.”
URIC ACID. —The presence of this acid in the blood is the cause of people suffering from,
Rheumatism, Gout, Neuralgia, Backache, Lumbago, Sciatica, Gravel, and Bladder Troubles. The
accumulation of uric acid in the blood is a certain indication that the kidneys are acting inefficiently.
Warner’s Safe Cure acts specifically upon the kidneys, and invariably restores those vital organs to.
health and activity, when all suffering due to uric acid poisoning ceases.
A, simple test to make as to the condition of the kidneys is to put some of the urine, passed the
first thing in the morning, into a bottle or covered glass, and let it stand until next morning. If it is
then cloudy, or if it contains a sediment like brick-dust, or if particles float about in it, or it is of an
unnatural color, the kidneys are not healthy, and no time should be lost in commencing to take
Warner’s Safe Cure. [2]

The Wisdom of the Red-Nosed
Man.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
YOU find your wisdom where you can
I listened to the Red-nosed Man.
It was within a tavern dim,
And I had filled his glass for him.
Said he : “I do not hold at all
With what they say of alcohol.
“ Many a man upon the brink
Of madness has been saved by Drink.
» It makes a folly of Distress,
And bridges gulfs of Bitterness.
“ Rum is a royal anodyne,
And if you have not rum—drink wine.
“Then, from the cage of sordid Sense,
Flies forth the bird Benevolence.
“ And from the cell of Circumstance
Emerges rosy-winged Romance.
“ And, while the amber liquid flows,
Your heart will blossom like a rose.
“ Your spirit will be light and free,
And all men will your brothers be.
“ The troubles that so heavy lay
Upon your chest will pass away,
“ And life, that was an evil dream,
To you will like a circus seem.
“Care cannot touch a Being Great
Who is the Master of his Fate :
“ He worries little over rent
Who is the Lord of the Event.
“ To-morrow Death may come his way—
Ho is the Owner of To-day.
“ Science can measure mote and star,
But he than she is wiser far.
“ He knows what stars and planets say
Who walks the Rum-and-Milky Way.
“ Much slander has been told, I think,
About the poor old Demon Drink.
“ To mean and narrow lives he brings
Some temporary joy in things—
“ Some fairer view, and larger scope,
Some gleam of fond, if foolish, hope.
“ Drink makes, when he’s not too far gone,
A navvy a Napoleon.
“ On Saturdays he takes delight
In talking large, Homeric fight,
“ And promptly he will show to you
The right way to win Waterloo.
“ Drink makes the fool talk by the page ;
A happy fool it makes the sage.
“ Quaff deep, my friend—you will, of course
For Rum is better than Remorse.
“ Rum fires you with intentions fine ;
Remorse just melts away your spine.”
Thus, in moist, mellow accents, ran
The sermon of the Red-nosed Man.
CREEVE ROE.
Mine-hunting in Tuscany.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE left Livorno in the afternoon and ran,
in a train that might be said to walk, up
the valley of the Arno to Empoli; and
thence by another train—of a speed equal to that
of the paralytic beggar, with the dragging hind-
quarters, at Santa Fiora —to Siena. It was very
good to be alive in the end of that spring day.
The vines, looped from tree to tree, carried grape
and leaf and tendril to the topmost swaying bough;
the corn was splashed with poppies; the dresses of
the women laborers in the fields made more splashes
of color; and wherever there was the underpart of
a tree already dark the fireflies thridded it.
At Castol Florentino I had a few minutes’ wait,
and a hundred women of the oontaclini and labor-
ing class passed me. They were all fairly young
in years ; but gnarled with hard work, and tanned
by the sun, and crackled dry by the winds of the
field ; and, sure sign of poverty, all the married
women wore wedding-rings of silver—not a yellow
annello among them. Not that silver is not a
more beautiful metal than gold, but a man gives
his girl the best ring he can afford.
Struck Siena in the dark. I awoke to a perfect
day, and found an exceedingly fat man, who
raved of a mine 25 miles off, and said he had a car-
riage and two horses ready. The horses were
more than ready—they champed and foamed
before they got away, and were lunatic when they
did. We rattled through streets of old palaces
sitting cheek by jowl with mouldering little shops,
surrounded by horrible ammoniacal odors; past
many Sienese standing in the characteristic Italian
attitude—which is looking blankly at a wall from
a distance of four inches —and through the Gate
of San Marco, which is tall, brown, and fifteenth
century. Outside the gate the road winds down
and down a hill so high that it is almost a
mountain. There are olives on the foot hills and
vines; groups of stone pines; ilex, myrtle, and
laurel masking old gardens of roses and jasmine;
and plentifully—but not one too many —the beau-
tiful calm cypresses, shaped like flame and feather
in one, which I do love. Between the trees the
light greenness of new crops ; and, on the heights
behind, Siena, Etruscan, Roman, and Renais-
sance all together—golden in the sunlight.
Noon saw us at the little summit of a mountain
road dipping steeply to a ruined castle by a noisy
river, and I inquired of the fat man as to the mine
of his ravings. We were joined by a spruce Jew,
and those two gave me circumstantial evidence of
the estate that held the mine and was for sale
with it, but nothing of the mine itself.
“What of the mine? ” I asked.
“There are 3000 hectares in the estate,” re-
plied the fat man.
“And bricks and tile clay of first quality,” re-
marked the Jew.
“ What about the mine?”
“The estate produces in oil and wine 45,000
francs a year,” said the fat man.
“ Have you shipped any ore ? ”
“ And there is a beautiful castle of the sixteenth
century, with a very fine tower and a big bell,”
said the Jew.
“ What’s your deepest shaft ? ”
“ A geological person from Rome examined the
estate, and says that we have good opportunities,
and there are two oil mills for crushing the olive,
and many wine presses.”
I gave up the cross-examination. We lunched
at a brown-and-yellow castellated house on a
height—green peas in the pod and tunny for hors
d’ceuvre, garlic sausage of Bologna, raw ham,
stewed veal, fowls, salad, fruit, and red wine.
The pair-horse buggy had reached its limit, and
they gave me a horse as proud as the day and I
were. The exceedingly fat man and the Jew packed
themselves into an ox-cart, panniered with willow
wands, that they might not fall out. The ox-cart
was slow and bumpy—the wheels were solid
circles —the shape of the cart was a chariot, but it
had no chariot speed. It was drawn by two big
dun Roman cows—more dull and meditative
than usual by reason of being in full milk.
Their tight udders—the teats pink as the nose
of a Poland pig—swayed against their flanks
as they walked. Neither the horse nor I could
wait for the funeral ox-cart. We took the pride
out of each other by long, bumpy, scrambly gallops
over the sides of the volcanic hills, returning after
each half-mile of joyful madness to the ox-cart.
The day was blue and gold, with little flower
blushes in it. The cows were dun, the cart ver-
milion, and the black-moustached driver had his
head tied up in a scarlet kerchief. The thrush
sang in the bush and the lark on high ; and tho
fat man, lying like a bundle in the springless ox-
cart, was dead to the discomfort of a solid wheel
rising and falling over 2ft. high boulders, and
snored.
The Jew sat awake, but almost as dead, looking
fixedly at the track behind him. It was almost
impossible to believe the other man a Latin, and
when he awoke I questioned him.
No ; he was born in Italy, but his mother was
an Austrian and his father a German.
That explained his phlegm, and as for the Jew,
no man expects a Jew to be energetic in the face
of no immediate profit.
We came to the swift-running Merza River, and
the fat man awoke in time to save his socks from
the flood, and he and the Jew sat with the driver
on the overhanging front of the chariot. My
proud horse would not walk quietly through the
three feet depth of two hundred feet wide river—
he splashed and pannaded and voyaged sideways
on two legs, and so brought me to the shore, wet
to the skin, but glad with the struggle. Looking
back at the crossing of the other part of the army
was fine. A lucent river on a bottom of white
pebbles, willows and young oaks just recovering
from the sickness of their first leaves, the red ox-
cart and the gay clothing of the people in it (at
the ford the cart had picked up three peasant
women accompanied by many dogs), the dun cows
trying to refuse the water, and when they took it,
feeling very sad as the stream smote cold on their
full udders, the high river banks bursting into
primroses and violets, half-a-dozen swimming dogs
and one long, thin, yellow puppy running up and
down the further shore, afraid of the water, and
yelping agony in four sharps.
We went on through more crops, and a haze
came down on the distances of that golden after-
noon. We saw Monte Amiata, snow-capped and
trying to look cold. The fat man showed me one
of the “mines,” which was not a mine, but a
farce ; and I laughed over it and felt very merry.
In the dusk we came to a moss-grown ramp
leading to a hoary church and a castle smitten
with the leprosy of ancient lichens. I saw a high
tower above the great courtyard, where I dis-
mounted—the courtyard ended in battlements;
and outside and below there was a blur of purple
200 yards long, suggesting millions of iris; and
white and pink clouds held up on brown columns,
suggesting fruit trees in bloom in Japan. And
then the darkness came in a moment, and the
night began.
There was little to eat in that castle which was
to be sold with the estate (which was to be thrown
in with the “mine”). So we foraged at two
farmhouses near by, and found a kid, a fowl, a
cheese of sheep’s milk, a barrel of wine and many
radishes. We might have eaten a ton of radishes
a man had we desired. This great house had
fallen into disuse —only a caretaker and his wife
lived there, and they were very poor. All the old
furniture had been taken away and “replaced”
by certain utensils for occasional visitors—tables
and chairs and beds which were necessary, and
early Victorian waxwork and antimacassars, and
German litho work, which were not.
It was an ideal place for a camp—that Graz
castle and the battlemented courtyard, and the
long, gentle descent of iris bloom, and I wondered
if luck would give me a mine in such a place, and
longed that it should be so. For the castle and
the irises were part of the estate, and the estate
was to be sold with the mine, and the battle-
mented courtyard, and the great, groined dining-
room, and the arched ballroom and the bedrooms,
like churches, were very desirable as a manager’s
residence.
But it is not in nature to place a new mine near
to old civilisation and luxury. That day my
hopes were blasted, and I could foresee only a bark
hut and a brush dining shed, and a case of tinned
meat and a camp oven, instead of the ancient com-
fort of the medieval castle and the romantic out-
look of the hills of lilies.
I awoke in a bedroom the size of an Ebenezer
church, and looked out into the big moss-grown
courtyard. The birds that sunrise did the usual
European five per cent, of the sweet noises of an
Australian dawn, and the great clock boomed
above and shook the building. Six o’clock and a
perfect day. Down to the courtyard I went, and
found that purple blur below the battlements
materialised into a quarter of a mile of lilies, their
golden hearts besieged by many bees. Below
them, hills of olive trees and seas of white and
pink pear and peach-bloom, and cypresses and
olives, again melting into the green of distant
grass and the blue of the haze that is heat later in
the day. Monte Amiata near the horizon, and,
scattered about the sunlit hills, the craggy towns
of Bari, Roccasirada and Boccagano, of Arcliidosso
and Castella del Plano—which last is the Castle
of the Plain, because it is built on a mountain.
We breakfasted very happily on a terrace of
roses and jasmine, with a cypress standing sentry
behind each man ; and then I mounted the proud
horse and went capering down the hills of olives
and cypresses ; but the fat man and the Jew fol-
lowed in the tardy ox-cart of yesterday. I always
knew that Europe was weary and effete—but I
did not know before that day that it was weary
enough to go prospecting in an ox-waggon. How-
ever, as the alleged mines proved to be non-
existent (they had been imagined on the strength
of ten tons of 5 per cent, ore being won in GOOft.
of driving and sinking), there was no hurry neces-
sary—except in leaving them.
I parted from the fat man and the Jew and
they returned sorrowfully to the Castle in their
ox-cart. I struck a miserable village, and “ turned
down” another “mine” in the afternoon. Half-
a-dozen Italians dined with me on spaghetti,
grilled beef-bones, mushrooms, artichokes, and
the eternal fowl with very heavy wine of Monte
Antico. The communal doctor had been eleven,
and the priest fourteen, years there. They frankly
stated that they had been more or less drunken
every night for many years, and that they in-
tended to so continue. After a study of that
fearful village no man could blame them for aught
but staying there. A man has. to be a bad lot
when he is content for long with anything not
good enough for him.
There was hut one “stranger’s” bedroom in the
despairing settlement, and the priest offered me a
bed at the church. They had emptied my whisky
flask, and with an Italian a little whisky goes a
long way. They carry liquor worse than any
other men on earth, and the party that was left
hiccuped “Buonanotte” and “ Felice notte ”as
the uncertain priest and my amused self went out
of the door that the pretty Terrizzeta opened, and
the stately Energida guarded. The room at the
priest’s house had a very big bed in it; and I
wandered and swam round on that half acre of
mattress until the church bell struck four, and I
knew it was time for the track again,

Doctor i "Is the pain there?
Aft! that's Kidney trouble, u
HOW TO FIND OUT.—Does
every cold affect your back and
cause a disturbance of the action
of the kidneys ? Do beer, spirits,
and tea excite the kidneys ? Does
a slight exertion tire you,
causing shortness of breath ? Do
little things annoy and irritate
you ? Do your limbs swell, or is
there a puffiness under the eyes ?
Do you have pains in the back,
sides, or head ? Have you
rheumatism, gout or gravel ?
These symptoms, and many
more, come from weak or sick
kidneys.
Doan's Backache Kidney Pills
soothe and heal the sore surfaces
of kidneys and bladder, and thus help the kidneys to filter
and pass off the disease impurities. Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills are a special medicine for the kidneys and bladder, have
no action on the bowels, and are still made of the same roots
and herbs as they were 72 years ago.
Another Lasting: Sydney Cure.
Mr. P. Smith, 1 Clieltenham-street, Balmain, this city, says Over twelve
months ago I used Doan’s Backache Kidney Bills for kidney trouble, and they
worked a miracle in my case. I had been under three doctors at different times,
but their treatment did mt no good. I used to be so bad that I would have to be
carried home in a cart if an attack came on when working in the street home-
times when walking, I have had a bad attack, and would be taken to the hospital.
My wif© said she never thought I would live through some of these bad turns. 1
suffered with a kind of biliousness, vomiting egg-like stuff. My secretions were
in a frightful state. I could never bend my back or move at all when 1 nail a bad
turn. The people at the hospital gave me medicines, and recommended rubbing
in liniments, but it was no use ; they did not benefit me. I saw an advertisement
for Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, stating that these 1 ills had cured
Mr. Dunn, and knowing him led me to procure this remedy. 1 only took
one box of Doans Backache Kidney Bills, and they cured me Iho first
dose relieved me. When I had finished them I started work, and have worked
ever since. It is heavy work I am.doing, but it does not affect me. lhese Bills
cured me after vears of suffering, and the relief was almost instantaneous. 1 might
state that since'then I have had a bad attack of lumbago, which laid me up for
one month. I never thought that Doan’s Backache Kidney _ Bills were
good for this complaint. Then I remembered that I bad a few in the box,
and, not having any other medicins in the house, I tried them, lhey cured me.
.n-s, onntn states later on :—“ Three years ago my husband gave testimony
regarding Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. He lias had wonderful health since he
used that remedy ; in fact, never having had a sign of the ailment return. I am
firmly convinced he owes his life to Doan’s Bills, for he could not have stood the
pain he used to suffer before he used these pills. I never saw anybody in such
agony. He has never missed a day at his work since he used Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills four years or more ago.” _
Twelve months later Mrs. Smith makes a third statement, as follows: My
husband is still well, and it is over five years since Doan’s Pills cured him. They
are splendid Pills.”

Don’t Neglect
A COMMON CASE OF PILES.
IT MAY LEAL TO SERIOUS RESULTS.
When people generally understand that all
such fatal diseases as fistula, ulcer of the
rectum, fissure, etc., almost invariably begin
in a simple case of Piles, they will learn the
wisdom of taking prompt treatment for the
first appearance of trouble in this quarter.
Doan’s Ointment will certainly cure every
form of piles—itching, bleeding, protruding,
and blind piles—and hundreds of lives have-
been saved by using this cheap but effective
remedy at the start, because at such times a
single pot will effect a cure, while in the old,
deep-seated, chronic cases several pots are
sometimes necessary before a cure is effected.
Here is a case in point:—
Mr. William Gilliver, of Gilliver and Curtis,
General Contractors, whose private address is
“ Avoca,” Bankstown, writes us December 10,
1900
I wrote you February 14, 1893, advising you
that Doan’s Ointment had cured me of piles
after twenty-two years’ affliction. I had let
six months go by before I wrote that letter,
as I wished to see whether the cure was a
permanent one. I had used many remedies
in these twenty-two years’ trouble, and could
scarcely believe that only half a pot of oint-
ment could work such a cure. Since I wrote
that last letter I have had more lasting
proof of the durability of the good this
preparation has done me. I have not had
occasion to use the ointment since. It was
a permanent cure. Many people wrote to me
about the value of Doan’s Ointment, and 1
advised them to give it a trial, and then let
me know the results. In consequence 1 have
received many letters telling me of cures
effected by Doan’s Ointment.” ,
It cannot be repeated too often that Doan s
Ointment will cure itching piles. It will cure
them absolutely. But do not take our word
for it. Write 'to Mr, Gilhver, and ask him.
He knows. It is for sale by all chemists and
storekeepers at 2s. !)d. per box, or will be
posted on receipt of price by Foster-McClellan
Co., 76 Pitt-street, Sydney.
But be sure it is DOAN’S.
Susan.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I MET Susan in a dancing pavilion. A casual
stroll on a harbor foreshore road one Sunday
afternoon had brought me to the dance-
place. The master of ceremonies and I had met
before, on an occasion when it was in my power to
do him some slight service, and as I passed the
pavilion door he hailed and invited me in for
an hour’s sport. He would not be denied.
“There’s a donah here without a bloke,” he
confided; “ I promised to get ’er one. You’ll
do.”
The band was playing a waltz and the dancers
swayed around in time to the music. There was
nothing frigid or formal in the attitude of the
couples. Each lady’s head rested on a gentleman’s
shoulder in a way that was suggestive of whole-
hearted surrender. The gentleman’s oiled head
pressed the lady’s cheek. It wa3 a most loving
dance.
The M.C. led me through the wheeling throng
till we reached the place where Susan sat. She
was an obviously disappointed and forlorn Susan,
but she brightened a little when we had been
introduced.
“I brought you this bloke, Susan,” the M.C.
said with a side toss of the head towards where I
stood, and then he drew me aside to advise me in
a friendly way.
“Buck up to ’er,” he said. “Make things
willin’. Take ’er for a shazzy. She’s an orlright
tirt, but a bit shy.”
He left me, and I took a seat beside Susan. I
could not see her face for a while because of the
size and magnificence of her hat. The feather
which adorned it was surely never worn by an
ostrich. It rather suggested a pterodactyl’s.
There were other hats in the room, but none that
made such a large hole in the atmosphere as that
of Susan.
“ Do you dance ? ” I asked.
She turned to me and nodded.
“I don’t,” I added.
Susan gave me a dark, disbelieving glance, and
I hastened to explain.
“I never learnt,” I said.
Susan’s lips parted, showing little white teeth.
“Kiddum,” she exclaimed.
“No, not kiddum,” I answered.
Susan turned away to watch the dancing couples.
I noticed that her face in profile was charming.
She gave a little heave of the chest, and faced me
again.
“What do you talk about?”
“About politics,” I replied.
She looked at me with seeking eyes for a little
while, and presently she seemed to understand.
“0 Freetrade,” she said.
I nodded, and her mouth curved in a slight dis-
dain.
“That’s dry’ash.”
Then she looked away again, and I was afraid
that I had disappeared out of her world. I felt
that I must say something to recapture her atten-
tion.
“Susan,” I said, “how old are you?”
She turned and threw back her head with
bright, expectant eyes.
“Guess,” she said.
I knew I was on perilous ground. I had been
there before, and had slipped. I determined to
make no mistake.
“Fifteen,” I ventured.
She shook her head, and a tress of hair fell
down and hid an ear. She put it back, and I
noticed that the ear was daintily shaped.
“ Guess again.”
“ Sixteen! ”
“ No”—with petulance—“ eighteen.”
“ You don’t look it,” I said.
“Gam !” she replied, hotly.
“ No,” I said, boldly, feeling that I was on safe
ground; “you look a lot older.
Susan eyed me critically. It was a great com-
pliment I had paid her. Evidently in some cases
rt is a fine thing to be more than eighteen.
“ How much older?” she asked.
“Ten years,” I answered, gravely.
Then did Susan receive me into the company of
her friends, and display her confidences to me as
a glad bird exhibits its colors to the sun. She told
me all about herself, and what her hat had cost.
She worked as a kitchen-maid in a city shop, and
all her earnings she devoted to the purchase of
gowns and shoes and ribands and hats. She never
needed to bring any money home. Her brother
kept the home going. Her brother was a bright
and energetic bottle oh. He did not go around in
a cart crying at people’s gates for empty bottles.
He was a trifle above that kind of thing. , His
vehicle of trade was a boat. He was a merchant
of the marine who cruised the Harbor foreshores
after every Sunday and holiday, and gathered the
mute and motionless witnesses of bygone revels.
I have some acquaintance with the capacity of
the out-for-a-holiday Australian, and I remarked
that Susan’s brother must be following a profitable
profession.
“It’s an orlright joint,” admitted Susan—
“ some weeks he bags three quid.”
The dance was at an end, and the dancers, with
red faces, had gone to their seats. A clatter of
speech and laughter went _ round the room,
but Susan was interested in her subject, and
pursued it to the end. She was proud of herself
and of her family, and I have an idea from the
look that got into her eyes now and again that she
fancied herself some degrees above the class with
whom she associated. When her theme was ex-
hausted, she turned her thoughts on me.
“What do you do tor a crust?” she asked
suddenly.
I was taken aback. I had no time to invent,
and the truth had its way before I was aware of it.
“ I write,” I answered.
Susan gave a perceptible shrug and threw back
her head" I noticed then for the first time that
her throat was very full and white.
“ Quill-drive ? ” she remarked disdainfully.
“No,” I said gravely in an effort to impress
her, “I write poetry.”
I know that I should have called it verse; but
others call it that so often that I balance matters
by sometimes giving it the magnificent title.
“Po’try,” said Susan, her dark eyes growing
large ; “ po’try ; do they pay you for that kind of
thing?”
“ A little,” I said, “ but it would pay me better
to make beer.”
i Susan watched me in silence for a little, sum-
roing me up soul and body, and the result she
arrived at was neither flattering nor condemna-
tory.
“ Well,” she said, with a half-laugh, “ you ’re a
queer kind of bloke.”
The dancers had resumed their places on the
floor, and were going through a performance that
made devious figuring necessary.
Susan’s bright little shoe, with its pointed toe
and high heel, beat time to the music on the floor,
and I said :
“ Susan, have you a lover ?”
Her face flushed daintily, and she laughed.
“No.”
My friends accuse me of being an egotist, but I
swear there was a note of invitation in her voice.
I glanced at Susan’s eyes, they were dark ; at her
face, it was pretty ; at her throat, it was round
and white.
“ Have you ?” said Susan.
I was going to say something, but illumination
came to me. I looked at Susan’s hands. They
were red and coarse, and altogether out of harmony
with her face and eyes and throat, and I said :
“ Yes, Susan ; I have seven.”
Susan’s face fell, but still she laughed.
“ You ’re kiddin’,” she said.
Before I could deny or admit the impeachment,
the M.C. came to tell us that the dancing was
over for the day.
* * * *
I had difficulties, and to spare, that night.
It was a task of some magnitude to escape from
the society of the advanced women with whom I
had been spending the evening. Some of them
were so far advanced that they seemed to have
gone right over the frontier of sex. They talked
and thought like men, and I felt uncomfortable in
their company; for it is always an unnatural
thing to hear bearded thoughts from unbearded
lips. One master mind held me with a cold eye
for an hour and more while she begged my
opinion, and gave hers, on the question of the
elective affinities. All the while she expatiated
on the effort of Nature to produce the perfect,
peaceful creature —an effort frustrated always by
the blind passion of man for woman and woman
for man, and that mad thing called love—l was
searching my soul for a pretext to be up and gone.
At length 1 discovered .one and left. My second
difficulty presented itself in the shape of a friend
whom I met on my way to the ferry. He had
been feasting with the gods, and the perfume
of their nectar was thick upon him, and
time and tide were nought to him. He
swore by his Immortal Soul and by his halidom
that I should not leave him till he had had some
large talk with me. He held me by the coat and
poured his story in my ears. He told me with
tears that something had happened to the only
woman he had ever loved. She had died or got
married, I did not correctly understand which,
but any way she had done something to cause my
friend a good deal of pathos, and I sympathised
with him. He said he was determined to end all,
once and forever. He had determined on a Gar-
gantuan drunk—the last Great Drunk of All he
called it. He said that for him the hour was about
to strike. I looked at my watch—for me also it
was on the edge of consummation. I broke from
him and ran—and as I boarded the ferry the hour
struck.
It was a moonlit night, and I went on the top
deck. A year had passed since I had seen Susan,
and she was looking at me for some seconds before
I recognised her.
“Been havin’ a good time, I suppose?”
I nodded.
“ And you ?”
“ Pretty fair,” she said.
Some of the sparkle had gone out of her eyes.
She seemed tired.
“Been to see the girl?” she asked.
I shook my head.
“ Where have you been? Just left him, I sup-
pose ? ”
She gave a little laugh, with a good deal of bit-
terness in it.
“Left him? ’E left me—three months ago,”
she said.
I waited, and for the second time that night I
heard a story.
“ ’E made room for me on the Manly boat,” she
said. “ I was on me own, and ’e ’ad no one with
him. We used to go together after. I was fair
struck on ’im. ’E used to do all the talkin’. It
was like ‘Eaven to ’ear ’im. I was dumb. ’E
liked me to be dumb. Used to call me Silence
with a finger on ’er lips.”
“ It was a good image,” I said.
“’E used to be always quotin’po'try. Night
after night ’e’d lie with is ’ead on me lap,- talkin’
roses and stars. One night ’e said : ‘ Susan, is all
that we see er seem but a dream inside a dream ? ’
I thought it was, and I said so. I know diff’rent
now. It’s no dream—it’s a true bill.”
“Nights like these,” continued Susan, “we’d
go down the ’Arbor to Watson’s or Manly and the
moonshine seemed to get into ’is ’ead, and ’e’d
start quotin’ and never leave off. E was like
Bland ’Olt in mellerdrama, when Bland ’Olt thrills
you. You know what I mean.”
“Bland Holt in an heroic mood,” I said, “ when
he says ”
She took the words out of my mouth and said :
“ ‘Keep your gold and I’ll keep my honor,’ or
‘ Poverty is noble,’ or ‘ ’Onesty before the world’s
applause,’ or ‘I never wronged an innercent woman
yet.’ ”
“Just so,” I said.
“’ls po’try used to thrill just the way that
Bland ’Olt gets ’old of the ’ouse. Does po'try
ever thrill you like that ? ’
“Sometimes,” Premarked.
“ The last night we was together,” said Susan,
“’e came out with a new piece. ’ls arm was
round me and I began to thrill and fall.towards
’im as he spoke it. In a low, tender voice he
spoke the thing through. ‘I rise up from
dreams of thee,’ ’e said.” She paused and looked
at me.
“P’r’aps you know it?” she asked.
“ I do—Shelley’s ‘ Serenade,’” I answered.
“ It was lovely,” she said, “ ’is voice seemed to
get on fire and to burn me, and when ’e talked of
dyin’ an’ faintin’ and failin’, I threw me arms
around ’im and began to sob.”
She was silent fori a little while, looking down
at a fan, and opening and shutting it.
“’E said to me, ‘Dearest, will you be my own
love forever and always?’”
She paused again.
“ And what did you say ? ”
She turned a critical eye on me.
“ I said ‘ Yes.’
“ Is that all ? ”
“ I said ‘Yes, you’re just the bloke for me. ”
I kept command of my countenance. I did
not quiver in even an eye-lash.” >
“And then?”
“’E got up ’an ’e said, ‘My God !’ an’ ’e left
me. Went straight away without another word.”
The boat had arrived at its destination, and as
I rose to go she said :
“ Why ’e chucked me I don’t know —do you ?”
I did not tell her.

Mr. H. C. Bret-
tell, Kozelle-Bal-
main, N. S. W.,
sends the photo-
graph of himself
and grandchil-
dren, and says:
“Asa result of
overwork I be-
came completely
prostrated.
Friends advised
me to try Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla. I did
so, and before the
first bottle was
used I was able
to get up and
dress myself. Be-
fore I had used
three bottles my
appetite had re-
turned, and I was able to walk freely. Whenever I feel poorly I take a few
doses of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, and, lam all right again. I have been a public
school teacher for more than thirty years, and I can truthfully say that I
believe Ayer’s Sarsaparilla is as good for the young as for the aged.”
This testimonial tells two remarkable things about Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
First, that it will cure people when they are very ill indeed, “completely
prostrated,” as Mr. Brettell says. It also tells how valuable a medicine it is
when one is not very ill, simply “feeling poorly.” The reason for this is
because Ayer’s Sarsaparilla goes right to the foundation of things. In every
case it first removes all impurities from the blood, and then renews and
builds it up. This brings good appetite, sound digestion, strong nerves, and
robust health.
It is “Ayer’s” Sarsaparilla you want, not some new, untried kind. Get
the old, genuine, original Sarsaparilla, “Ayer’s.”
