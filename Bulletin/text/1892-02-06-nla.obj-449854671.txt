degrees which can be compared with his. Such eminent
qualifications, together with his recognised straightfor-
ward treatment, has naturally gained for him the reputa-
tion of being the

Knowledge Honest Treatment, as may easily be ascer-
tained by applying to any leading paper in the colony.
No diseases cause so much misery and distress as those
included in my speciality.
All Men Young and Old.
Suffering from the results of early follies or ex-
cesses, indigestion, foul mouth, costiveness, palpi-
tation, singing and pains in the ears and head,
specks before the eyes, giddiness, weakened
memory, pains in the back and chest, varicocele,
diseases of the bladder, kidneys, or liver, rheuma-
tism, impure blood, weakening discharges, impaired
vigor, sterility, premature decay, stricture, nervous-
ness, groundless fears, bashfulness, lassitude, and
NERVOUS DEBILITY, should lose no time in
consulting him, since he has, by long experience
and thorough investigation of their nature, dis-
covered the safest treatment for their permanent
cure. Persons residing at a distance may be treated
at their own homes, without any interruption to
-their business, by giving a full and clear descrip-
tion of their symptoms, and the necessary medi-

This Ungrateful Nation.
Several months ago Charles Lilley, Chief
Justice of Queensland, began to assume in
public a certain ultra-democratic attitude,
which created a considerable sensation,
and caused the Cabinet of the Imperial-
istic Samuel Griffith to breathe forth
threats of vengeance. At the time when
Judge Lilley made his first bid for the
leadership of the Republican party in Aus-
tralia, the country was troubled by various
small wage-problems, which were then com-
monly designated as the “shearers’ insurrec-
tion,' 1 and it was held in many quarters that
Lilley’, s disbelief in royal institutions would
intensify the trouble, and incite the frenzied
bush man to demand more pay. That class
of fatted individuals commonly designated
in the papers “all right-thinking persons”
even complained that the Queensland Chief
Justice (like the Republican Chief Justice
of Victoria), was inciting to anarchy and
civil war, and it was generally under-
stood that his language would cause a pain-
ful sensation in England. This latter
prophecy, at all events, has come true ; Sir
Charles’ views upon Australian independ-
ence have at last dawned, in their full horror
and malignity, on the British intellect, and
Britain is at once sorrowful and indignant.
We have before us some six or eight extracts
from various English papers all dealing with
the subject from the same standpoint, and
of these assorted Avails the following, from
the Home N lavs, is a fair example :
His comments contain the essentials of the case for an
Independent Australia. It cannot hut be regarded as a
curious fact that men such as the Chief Justice of Queens-
land should adopt this attitude. They have seen Aus-
tralia grow great and prosperous under the British fhi"-;
they know how much the mother country lias sacrificed
for the sake of her colonies, and how in the last half
century she has given them, with most generous hand, all
they ask, and in return they promise her separation and
practical isolation. In Imperial, as in other matters,
virtue is to be its own reward, according to the views of
Sir Charles Lilley and those who think with him.
Magnanimous as the mother country has been in the past,
he naturally hopes that she will carry her good nature a
little further and permit the colonies to secede just when
and how they please. It is not surprising that such an
observer should view the Federal Constitution Bill with
disapproval. It is too patriotic, too loyal. Sir Charles
Lilley claims to represent “the real opinion of Aus-
tralia." But for the appearance of his name one might
confound his views with those of the fleetest of globe-
trotters, or of a fifth-rate member of some colonial
Legislature. If Sir Charles Lilley’s opinion is that of
Australia, for whom do men like Sir Henry Parses and
others responsible for the drafting of the Constitution
Bill speak ? For themselves? If so, their lease of popu-
larity and power needs explanation.
# # #
The other complaints are so exactly
similar in their tone as not to be worth re-
producing ; the one paper speaks for all (he
rest. And it also speaks for the whole
British nation, for whenever Australia
threatens to sever the “silken bonds” of
empire all Great Britain strikes a paralytic
attitude of pained surprise at the black aud
fathomless baseness of “ our kawlinies.”
The inevitable assumption on which the
incarnate Bull always travels is that, in some
unspecified way, and for some reason that is
never defined, Australia owes to Britain a
debt of gratitude which long ages of devotion
will be insufficient to repay. Therefore the
Home News and its contemporaries, as the
personification of Bull and all his works,
rise to reproach us with the things —not
particularised—which “the mother country
has sacrificed for the sake of her colonies, ’
and the concessions—not further explained—
which “ she has given them with most
generous hand." Even the British journa-
list cannot remember what these mythical
concessions and sacrifices are, for the suffi-
cient reason that they never existed. The
whole theory is a dull, dismal, bombastic
lie, a pompous perjury, the most hollow of
all hollow pretences. J. Bull, C.M.Gr.,
never made any “sacrifices;” but it is the
nature of the pachydermatous animal to
assume that he is a blessing to all with whom
he comes in contact, and that everybody
whom he ever exploited in trade or war
owes him a debt of gratitude. Therefore,
he is surprised at the thanklessness of the
Chi naman whom he forced to buy his opium,
and the Irishman whose country he has
depopulated, and the Burmese whose land
he has filled with blood and ashes ; and the
soulless insensibility of everybody he has ever
insulted or plundered fills his soul with pain
England is the Pecksniff among humanity
- —the one great and enduring hypocrite of
the earth—and when it strikes an attitude
as the weeping parent of many thankless
nations, it is a fearsome spectacle to behold.
# # #
As we have already mentioned, the spread-
eagle Englishman, when he lodges his
perennial complaint concerning the malign
attitude of Australia, never descends to
particulars. Now and then, however, he
comes perilously near doing so, and on these
occasions the cause of his woe generally
seems to come under six separate and equally
tearful headings ; (1) England has defended
and still defends Australia from foreign aggres-
sion ; (2) England has supplied and still
supplies Australia with vast sums of money
by way of loans; (3) Australia was “founded”
by Englishmen, and, therefore, owes a debt of
gratitude to England as the original source
of its existence ; (4) Australia has grown
•great and prosperous under the British flag ;
(5) Australia, apart from all' pecuniary
considerations, stands to England in the
relation of a son to a father, and is
bound to that parent by a common
origin and a common speech ; (6) Eng-
land has made many “concessions’ to
Australia in the shape of local self-govern-
ment and free political institutions, which
same c mcessions should be remembered
with profound thankfulness for all time.
These, in a general way, are the alleged
obligations which this country owes to the
little, sea-girt, fog-haunted isle in the far
North Sea, and the disregard of them by the
Australian nation makes the Briton feel
that he has thawed a frozen serpent in his
bosom to his own undoing.
* * *
Possibly the Englishman—the dull, clod-
like Bull of the Nineteenth Century—
solemnly believes in the reality of Ids six
grievances. By much weary iteration he
may even have come to believe that, in some
shadowy and uncertain way, ho has defended
Australia, at some time or other, against
somebody, and spent much blood and
treasure in doing so. Yet the theory is (lie
most conspicuous lie that ever glared forth
in the pages of fiction. Australia never was
attacked—therefore, it was never defended
against anybody. England never spent a
single man or a single coin in protecting it
from any outside enemies, for it never had
any. It is claimed, of course, that this is a
mere matter of accident ; that if it had been
visited by enemies in the past England would
have protected it, and that if it should be
visited by enemies in the future the mighty
arms of the mother-land will be its defence ;
but this is mere theory at the best, and
nobody caii well be grateful for the things
that may be or for the things that might have
been. Ic is altogether too dubious and too
shadowy. Australia cannot well raise a sen-
timent of undying thankfulness because it
might have been attacked by some of Eng-
land’s enemies, and if so it might have been
defended by the resources of the Empire.
It is as reasonable to ask that a man should
repay with interest the money that his friend
might have lent him, but didn’t—that he
should cherish all his life the memory of the
hero who might have saved his life if the
occasion had arisen, but who was prevented
from doing it because the occasion didn’t
arise—or that he shotild put up a tombstone
over the brother who 'might have died, but
who, by chance, has remained alive. Life is
too short for calculating such elaborate
possibilities ; therefore, the world prefers to
deal with facts, and the hard fact in this case
is that England has never yet defended Aus-
tralia on any occasion whatsoever. Even
the British fleet which roams Australian
waters is only there for the defence of British
shipping ; there is a similar fleet off the South
American coast for exactly the same purpose,
and Australia is under just the same obliga-
tion for that squadron’s presence as aie
Brazil and Argentina for the presence of the
other British squadron by which their shores
are haunted.
* # #
As regards the second count in the indict-
ment, Australia has assuredly Obtained vast
sums of money from England, and for these
this country owes a debt of gratitude that
is to say, it owes exactly as much gratitude
for the principal as England owes for (ho
interest, and so far the dull and thankless
Eull has shown no sign of being at all
grateful for the interest, which has always
been promptly paid. It owes as much
gratitude and worship and adoration as any
solvent debtor does to his creditor —as much
as Rothschild or Vandekbilt does to the
man who holds his bill in the ordinary
course of business—as much as the Bank of
England does to any grocer or bootmaker
who chances to have one of its notes in his
pocket—and just as much as the patriotic
editor of the Home News does to the lady
who has washed his collar and his shirt, and
whose account is not yet settled. In other
words, it is a mere matter of business, and
if England wants gratitude it must do with-
out interest, or if it wants interest it must
do without the gratitude, for it can't have
gratitude and interest both. And the plea
that Australia was “founded” by Englishmen,
and is therefore under an eternal obligation
to England for founding it, may also be dis-
missed in a sentence. Australia is grateful,
despite certain unpleasant features in their
characters, to these Englishmen who estab-
lished the first beginnings of a new nation
in the Pacific seas. But these English-
men and their sons are now the Austra-
lian nation ; the blatant John Bull who
demands to be held in reverence as the
origin of Australia’s greatness is the Bull
who stayed at home and wasn’t the origin of
anything, and the person from whom ho
demands the reverence is the one who did
the work for which that reverence is to be
paid. Such unspeakable gall as this has no
duplicate in all history. The Englishmen
who built the cities of Australia, and con-
quered the mysteries of the great drought-
land of the new continent, and who are now
the new Australian people, are required to
be grateful for their own work to the men
who never saw Australia and many of whom
never will see it to the end of time.
* * #
The fourth item in the category —one on
which the Home News lays special import-
ance—may be admitted without further
question. Australia has grown great and
prosperous under the British flag. ‘ That flag
is a piece of cloth of various colours, and it
has been fastened to the end of a stick,
and the stick has been stood up on its
end by accident on Australian soil. What
it has had to do witli the prosperity
the writer docs not state. Barrb g
the colour there is very little difference
between the flag and a clean shirt on a line,
and as there is more clean shirt than flag it
is equally appropriate to state that Australia
lias prospered under the benign influence of
the under-garment as that it lias been
materially assisted by the gaudy banner of
Britain. Moreover, the flag is sometimes up
and sometimes uovvn, and the country gels
on just as well when it is down as when it is
up ; and in any case a flag really belongs to
whoever pays for the material and the stick ;
and further, Australia never asked for or
wanted the flag ; and last of all, the whole
subject is too miserably puerile to bo worth
attention. The fact that (he Australians
are, in the main, of British origin, and are
linked to Britain by a common descent and a
common language, is of equally small account
when put forward as a reason why Australia
should remain for ever faithful to the
Empire and for ever loyal to Britain. The
Britons of to-day made neither the language
nor the origin ; they received them both by
accident, and they passed them both on
because they couldn’t help it. Every nation
ha.s an origin, and every nation, so far as is
known, has a language, but England is the
only one of them all that is so far gone in
the horrible stupidity of its dotage as to
fancy that the world owes it an eternal debt
for possessing two things that everybody
owns and nobody can get rid of.
* # #
Even the fact that Britain has made many
alleged “ concessions ” to Australia does not
move us to gratitude somehow. Possibly
we are by nature an ungrateful race.
England has “conceded ” the right to make
our own laws within certain limits ; it would
have been an act of brutal tyranny to have
refused that right, and we are not necessarily
thankful to England for not being more of a
tyrant than it is. When a small man meets
a large one on a lonely street he is not bound
to worship that large man for ever after-
wards because he doesn’t jump on him by
virtue of his size and strength, and the two
situations are exactly parallel. Australia, at
the time it first claimed the right of self-
government, was certainly too weak to
enforce its claims by war, but the demand
was as justifiable as if it had been backed by
100,000 armed men. And when the Home
News asks, in accents of wild surprise, if w'e
expect that England will permit us to secede
just when and how we please, the answer
comes promptly in two words ; We do. The
t ime is gone by when one nation can belong
as a matter of right to another nation, or
w hen one man can belong to another man.
I he great principle of the British constitu-
tion is (hat the people are the last court of
appeal, and if the British people are the last
court of appeal in Britain, then the Aus-
tralian people are of the same effect in
Australia. The Englishman, it is true,
regards this rule. as applying to him-
self only ; when he utters the well-worn
axiom that the voice - of the people is the
■ voice of (Jon he means really that the voice
of the English people is the utterance of (he
(ion of the whole universe ; but then this
is a purely English view of the matter, and
(lie incarnate Bull has this opinion all to
himself. By virtue of the noble British
Constitution, 1 he principles of human liberty,
and the common rights of humanity, these
provinces expect that England will “allow
them to secede” peacefully, unquestioningly
and just when a id how they think best!
They owe nothing to the Empire either
in money or gratitude ; they have re-
ceived nothing from the Empire that has
nut been paid for in full ; they have built
their own cities, and opened up their own
country, and organised their own Govern-
ment just as England did, and they expect,
just as England does, to control the works
they have created at their own absolute plea-
sure. They have lived under the shadow of
the British flag and they will send that flag
back undamaged ; they have enjoyed the in°
estimable benefits of the British language,
and they will leave that language in as good
repair as they found it. ThcTconnection ends
fheie ; it is a purely business relationship
though disfigured by much irrelevant brass-
band and national anthem, and when one
member refuses, some day or other, to renew
the partnership, it will dissolve in peace. At
any rate, we hope so.
A Matter of “Crood Taste.”
Near the close of the Nineteenth Century a
number of men, amongst whom were several
Republicans, met as representatives of modern
democracy in an alleged free and enlightened
State, to pass a vote of condolence to the parents
of a young man who had just died, a young man
with whom they were absolutely unacquainted,
whoso only claim upon their attention was the
lact that, had ho lived long enough, he might
one day have been crowned king of Great
Britain. Of this young man they knew
little, and of that little nothing strikingly
to his credit. He had achieved nothing for
humanity in even themeagrest measure, and he
gave every evidential symptom of achieving less
if he had lived long enough to achieve anything.
Yet, at the end of a period of time marked by
wonderful mental and material progress
in the world’s history, the Parliament of
New South Wales, headed by a Premier
who claims to be a Republican himself, passed,
with one single exception, a lying and hypo-
critical \ ote of condolence —mnply because the
deceased uas a Prince of the Blood Royal, and
for no other earthly reason. One man, and
only one man, had the courage and the honesty
to dissent from this piece of purely official—not
even sentimental—humbug. In a temperate
ami dignified little spieech, Mr. Arthur Rak.
the Labour member for the Murrumbidgee,
stated his powerlessness, as a Republican, to
join with the other members in condoling with
the griefs of Royalty—simply on the ground
that it teas Royalty. His remarks on the subject
were destitute of any single grain of offence or
vulgar aspersion, and only the most pronounced
toady could take umbrage at them.
* * #
The other day an Africander editor was
hooted and assaulted by a mob of Royalists
because he took occasion to print in his paper
something of the lately-dead Duke other
than laudatory ; and apparently there are
not wanting in New South Wales per
sons who are ambitious of dragging the
province down to the same level. Professor
Wallace remarks, in his book on Russia, that
freedom of speech is perfect in that country,
provided no one discusses either politics or
religion, and did the Australian daily press
really represent the feelings of the masses and
the native-born and younger generation, instead
of those of the British-born and propertied
classes who, up to now, have controlled the
country, it would be plain that there is
little to choose in point of sentiment be-
tween Australia and the Transvaal. For
no sooner had Mr. Rae made his speech
than an assumedly democratic evening paper
made a savage assault upon him, and the
upper-crust circle of polite society in Wagga
convened a public meeting requesting him to
resign his seat in Parliament, the Mayor, an
approved loyalist and a lavish entertainer of
vice-regality, sending a personal telegram to
the Governor expressive of his abhorrence of
Republicanism in general and Mr. Rae
in particular. The Sydney Daily Tele-
graph, an alleged democratic morning news-
paper, attacks Mr. Rae on the grounds of
“good taste,” as though political institutions
and conventional etiquette were synonymous
terms, and government were conducted after the
fashion of drawing-room entertainments. The
Republicans who lopped off the head of
Charles 1. were monsters of bad taste, and
the French Revolutionists who performed the
same kind ollice for Louts XVI. were impolite
to the last degree. Every inch of the ground
gained in the path of progress is a lapse in
decorum, and bad manners crowd the pages of
history. Mr. Rae acted according to his con-
victions, ho assailed the private character of no
one, ami, compared with the hypocritical com-
promise of many avowed Republicans in the
New South Wales Assembly, his position is
uniquely straightforward and honest. These
pseudo-democrats thought with him, but they
were too cowardly to face the great mob of
decorously conventional people whose minds
run in the rut of effete usage; they feared to be
accused of acting in “ bad taste.” ”
* * #
Whenever a royal grant is mooted in the
English Parliament, Laeouchere seizes the
occasion to make a Republican protest against
further pensioning the Royal Family, and no one
now thinks of accusing him of “ bad taste ” or
lack of sympathy. Rae simply followed
Laroughere’s example. On the grounds of
sympathy with parents who had lost a son,
with a young girl whose prospective husband
had died, he was entirely with the House and
said so. His contention, however* an eminently
just one, was that such were not the grounds
actuating the members of the New South Wales


Parliament. He rightly asserted that no
Ba „ e of condolence, no official declaration of
U ~',u ) alhy, was ever sent to the widows or
;[ ( | r en of men to whom humanity owed some-
and that the simulated departmental
,r ief of a democratic community was never put
on tap save over a royal or an imperial corpse.
, I now, after centuries of fighting for the
-io-lit of freedom of speech, after hundreds of
boastful assertions regarding the emancipation
f ie human intellect, after a liberty of
discussion of political, social, and religious
übiects, to attain which Russia is yearly
wasting tons of dynamite and hundreds of
human lives, the plucky little man from the
Murrumbidgee is (so far as the will of the
ess goes) to be ousted from his seat in
* democratic Parliament, simply because he
] uW l the honesty to challenge the integrity of
ihe sympathy so loudly expressed by a chamber
of supposed Republicans and semi-Socialists.
# * *
However, the press criticism of Mr. Raf.’s
conduct will not hurt him very much. The
public meetings in which he has been burned
in verbal effigy need cause him no alarm. These
meetings were convened by the people whose
votes were never recorded on behalf of Repub-
lican Rah. They are just about as representa-
tive of the feeling of the electorate as the cele-
brated ball-cartridge meeting at the old Ex-
hibition Building, on the occasion of Queen
Victoria's Jubilee, was representative of
the sentiments of the people of Sydney at
that time. Arthur Rah was sent to Par-
liament by the shearers and other workers to
represent Labour, and all the while he repre-
sents Labour faithfully, Labour will stand by
him. The mere vapourings of the uppercut
section of the community, whose very existence
depends upon slavishly ministering to a con-
ventional order, and whose very breath of life
is the air of fashion, he can afford to treat with
indifference. He is not and never has been
their representative, and he would be guilty of
an act of the supremest folly if he obeyed their
mandate to resign his seat. It would, moreover,
lie an act of treachery to the workers who sent
him to Parliament to watch over their interests,
and Mr. Rah can serve Labour in many worse
wavs than by his bold avowal of the Republican
principles to which he has been so true.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Identification.
fx Victoria, a week or two ago, a certain Mrs.
Marendaz lodged a complaint that she had
been criminally assaulted by some man un-
known. Thereupon the police arrested a swags-
mau named Wilson', and the prosecutrix came
along to “identify” him. The first attempt
was a failure; Mrs. Marendaz couldn’t posi-
tively remember having seen Wilson at any
time in her whole life before. He was still
detained in custody, however, and on a second
visit the lady was still unable to recall his face,
though it began to be a little more familiar.
The third day she commenced to recollect him,
and at the fourth or fifth attempt she remem-
bered him distinctly, and he was thereupon
committed for trial. When the case
comes up for hearing the bald fact
will be placed before the jury that the
prosecutrix “identified” Wilson, and the
method of identification will probably never be
fully explained. The chances are, in this
instance, that Mrs. Markndaz fully and
honestly believes she does recollect all about
the prisoner, and at t he same time the odds are
forty to one that she is utterly mistaken. The
fact that she was unable to recognise him on
the first attempt is a solid evidence that, up to
that date, she had never seen him. She did
remember him at a later attempt, but that does
not necessarily prove that she remembered him
as the man who committed the assault —she
simply recollected him as the man whom site
had seen during sundry previous attempts at
identification, and the recollections got mixed.
In such a case the witness must either identify
the prisoner light off or else her evidence is
absolutely valueless ; in other words, she must
remember by a natural process—not simply
learn to do so by an artificial method. Any-
body can learn, honestly enough, to recollect a
thing which never happened, simply by dwel-
ling upon it with sufficient persistency. In
Walter Besant’s novel, “ The Bell of St.
Paul ’s,” an old, coarse, utterly matter-of-fact
usurer is confronted with a forged will to
which his name is affixed as a witness, and is
requested to swear to his signature. He has
ho suspicions of the bona-fides of the document ;
he merely concludes that he has somehow for-
gotten having signed it, and he starts with
awful persistence to remember it. Then he
h'arns that loss of memory is a sign of incipient
softening of the brain, and in his frantic resolve
to escape the softening he resolves that he will
remember that signature or burst. He gives up
hquur and takes violent exercise and ice-cold
baths, and has galvanic shocks applied to his
head and the soles of his feet, and by all these
processes he comes at last to recollect the
whole of the case—despite the fact that there
never was any case—so absolutely that he even
lends money on the bogus document. This
episode is a solemn warning to people who get
U P artificial memories by a process of hard
dunking, and identify other people on the
strength of them. Anybody, in fact, can
remember anything provided he only tries hard
enough. If we made a sufficient effort we would
probably recollect the time, during the early
struggles of The Bulletin, when Parkes came
down to the office with a blank cheque in his
hand, and told us to draw on his account for
any money that we wanted, while Abigail and
the Catholic Archbishop offered to go joint
securities for an overdraft—in fact, seeing that
tnese things didn’t happen, we would probably
remember them a great deal better than we
would if they really did happen.
The Totalisator.
I he opposition to the total isator may be said
to come from two quarters : from those con-
scientiously opposed to the legalisation of what
"'CV consider a vice ; and from bookmakers and
others, influenced by more sordid motives. We
already have examples of the absurd position
adopted by the former class. For instance,
many estimable people hold that the liquor-
traffic should be absolutely prohibited rather
than licensed. However, while drinking, like
betting, cannot be put down by Act of Parlia-
ment, few sane people will deny that, under
certain restrictions, it works less ill than if con-
ducted without supervision. On the principle
of choosing the smaller evil, betting, while it
exists, is preferable in its less noxious form. In
fact, the opponents of the totalisator very much
remind us of the anti-vaccinationists. The one
class opposes a palliative, which deprives small-
pox of its worst terrors ; the other would wink
at the operations of the welsher, the extortionate
bookmaker, and the “ crouk ” sporting
tobacconist, rather than recognise a form of
betting which, to a large extent, protects the
people from their own folly. Nor is the
opposition of the second section any more
reasonable. The totalisator does not mean the
total extinction of the bookmaker. While
the less reputable members of the craft would
be bound to go to the wall, the better class of
pencillers, freed from the competition of un-
scrupulous rivals who, never intending to pay,
can now afford to lay longer odds, must actually
benefit by its introduction. It can never be
patronised by those who make sport a business.
For instance, the owner, the trainer, the jockey,
the professional backer, and even the outsider,
in possession of the “ straight tip,” naturally
try to put their superior knowledge to the
best possible account. They depend on busi-
ness methods rather than chance, and prefer
10 to 1 from a substantial bookmaker before-
hand to waiting for the day of the race, when,
owing to a rush of public support, their “ good
thing ” may only be an even-money chance.
Again, betting on the totalisator requires the
possession of ready money and is not suitable
for those whose wagers are necessarily large.
Joe Thompson, a cheque-book, and settling
day offer to men like Mr. Donald Wallace
conveniences impossible in the case of the
machine. The latter contrivance, therefore,
cannot affect the classes already mentioned, nor
the bookmakers whom these now patronise.
With the amateur turfite, as well as the welsher,
the “ Toe-Rag Tommy,” and the “ cronk ” tote-
promoter who now victimise him, the case will
be different. Its likelihood to annihilate
these latter undesirable excrescences would
alone justify the introduction of the totali-
sator. To those people who do not make
sport a study, yet, when they visit a
racecourse for recreative purposes, like to
arouse interest by means of a wager, the
so-called “infernal machine” offers many
advantages. It relieves them at once from the
unscrupulous bookmaker, with his one-sided
terms, as well as from the welsher who
simply robs them. The money invested—less
a legitimate dividend devoted to promoting
the sport, and, perhaps, relieving distress —
returns again to the public, instead of, as now,
going to keep a horde of gaol-birds, ex-prize-
fighters, and brothel hangers-on—fellows too
lazy to work and only too cowardly to become
burglars or garrotters. The ready-money prin-
ciple, too, prevents the amateur backer from
going beyond his depth. Retting on the “ nod”
is too often the downfall of the embezzling
clerk and the absconding cashier. In another
respect, the introduction of the totalisator
its legalisation on the racecourse only must do
good to both sport and the public. Instead of
feverishly haunting city cigar-divans, backers
would be forced to visit the race-course so as to
enjoy both the open-air and the racing, while
the clubs, in addition to the dividend on belting
investments, would thus greatly gain by the
increased gate-money. This extra revenue
could he devoted to charities and to providing
larger prizes for races. Careful consideration
convinces us that the legalisation of the
totalisator, while it may not satisfy the aspira-
tions of the idealist, would do much good by
offering an alternative to something far worse.

When the Time Comen.
One of the most obnoxious peculiarities cf
Toryism is the hopeful looking forward to a
bloody war, in which the rising generation are
confidently expected to prove themselves
worthy descendants of their ignorant king-
ridden ancestors, &c., and get killed accordingly.
The knighted Wrixon, at the A.N.A. banquet
list week, was snuffling to a martial strain
when he remarked that Australian nationality
might already lay claim to great energy of
character, and would doubtless demonstrate its
courage as well when the lime came. Courage,
in the old Tory sense of the term, can only be
displayed in the wretched game of human
slaughter, and no nation is truly great until it
has left a lot of valorous carcases rotting on a
battle-field, or fed the sharks with a quantity
of maritime heroes. The possibility of a nation
being born to live and die in peace is dis-
countenanced by men of Wrixon ’s order on Tory
principle. Standing armies are to them glorious
necessities, inasmuch as their loved monarchical
system is so utterly and entirely dependent
upon an occasional calling out of the military.
Consequently, Sir Wrixon, addressing a com-
munity that seems in peril of cultivating a
wholesome hatred for soldiers and the pomps
and horrors of war, gives its boys a patronising
pat on the back, and indirectly commiserates
them on the fact that their courage has not yet
been tested with gunpowder. But the time is
sin e to come, says Wrixon in effect, and then
you can wade in. Meanwhile, watch and pray
for a chance to exhibit your pluck. Put a gun
upon your shoulder and wait for something to
turn up. Fortunately, a time is very near at
hand, when no Australian politician will have
the impudence to talk such mischievous rubbish
as Wrixon talked at the A.N.A. corroboree.
Each male baby born upon the soil is a fresh
guarantee of safety for a people who live far
beyond warlike latitudes, and can (and do)
constantly demonstrate their courage by con-
quering the opposing natural forces of their
native land, not to mention the pleasant
diversion of knocking out individual cham-
pions from across the seas. Every hour
gives Australia greater immunity from attack,
for even as wc arc increasing and multi-
plying in population-the education of Europe is
fast advancing to a stage at which wars of
aggression, undertaken by disciplined fools at a
despot’s nod, will no longer be possible.
Already, in fact, the Tory manufacturers of
our shoddy military spirit look around in vain
for any possible invasion from anywhere save
Russia, a country undermined with Nihilism,
and ready to have a grand local blow-up for
freedom at any minute. Very soon the bottom
will have dropped clean out of the gaudy fiction
which pretends to excuse the fattening of a few
swashbucklers at Australia’s expense, and the
nuisance who would fain prattle of courage
“ when the time comes ” will have to howl for
civil war, or hold his tongue.
That lying institution, the Queensland “ Patri-
otic League” has this week been bowled out
even a little more badly than usual. The
“Patriotic League” is a Tory joint-stock associa-
tion, apparently formed to disseminate false
information about imaginary shearers who
poison tanks and mythical insurgents who
desire to overthrow the Constitution, and to
remove the names of all workers from the elec-
toral rolls by hard misrepresentation and other
means. In pursuit of its legitimate calling the
League, or some of its friends, lately sent forth a
horrid tale about 300 bogus voters who
were found to bo registered as residents
of one restaurant in Queen-street, Brisbane,
and who were all understood to vote in the
democratic interest. Then the “National
Associations ” of Sydney and Melbourne took
up the painful incident, and quoted it as a proof
that the democratic party in Australia was
utterly bogus and hollow —that the genuine
“working-men” of the country were solid in
the interests of capital, and that the “ Labour-
party ” was propped up entirely by impostors
who registered themselves as sleeping 50 in a
room in low-class ham-and-beef shops. The
one thing that breaks the story up is that
there are only 51 votes registered altogether
in all Queen-street, Brisbane, and therefore
the possibility of 300 being registered
in one house looks exceedingly remote.
To get 300 votes out of 51 and yet leave some-
thing over for the rest of the street is a work
of manifest difficulty. If the capitalistic party
which circulated the story didn’t recognise this,
then it is the last possibility in the way of a
fool ; if it did recognise it, then it is a very
great and hopeless liar. Also it suffers from a
woeful incapacity to lend a plausible aspect to
its perjury ; a lie is no good unless somebody is
likely to believe it, and the story of 300 bogus
electors in one hash-house can only rank with
“ Jack and the Bean-stalk ” and similar childish
improbabilities.
-O-
When the Duke of Clarence was a very new
subject for sorrow, and the voice of the gusher
was still loud in the land, the Argus ventured
to remark that some N.S. W. shearers, who had
openly expressed a sort of antipathy to
Royalty, w’erc naturally placed in a most pain-
ful position by the death of the Duke. Only a
few days previously these miserable republicans
had refused to take part in a grand bucolic
demonstration over Lord Jersey in his vice-
regal capacity. What was the result? The
Argus set its brightest intellects to consider
how those N.S. W. republicans would be
affected in the dark hour of newspaper lamenta-
tion by their reckless policy of contempt for
the Throne. And this is how the- bevy of
biting cynics, the brilliant young bucks of the
Argus, figured out the situation : “Being thus
debarred by their principles from rejoicing with
those that did rejoice, the shearers are equally
precluded, of course, from mourning now with
those that mourn, and must be placed for the
moment in a dilemma.” Holy Canton ! Was
the art of printing discovered that men might
pul a pen into their fists to steal away their
Itrains ? The shearers who objected to Clarence
as a representative of royalty, and to Jersey
as an official substitute for Clarence’s grand-
mother, had no cause to feel ashamed of the
fact that all ilesh is grass. Besides, there’s
nothing very awkw'ard about not being able to
snivel when you don’t want to snivel, although
there’s a good deal of satisfaction for the pro-
fessing democrat (quite apart from the circum-
stance of a dead Duke) in being able to put his
hand upon his chest and thank Heaven that he’s
better off than the Argus, which is always
mourning the death of some used-up institution
and objecting to principles that arc immortal.
The electoral rolls in Queensland arc still being
“ purified ” on an enormous scale. The Govern-
ment has voted £2OOO to help on the good work,
amlhasappointed,as revising justices, asquadron
of members of the bogus Patriotic League.
Then another officer of the Patriotic League
acts as “informer.” As the express object of
that body is to suppress the Labour movement,
this arrangement works well, for the League
gets up the cases in the first place, and the
League’s informer lays the matter before the
League’s revising justices, and nobody outside
the League gets a hearing. The new revising
court acts on a method that is entirely its
own ; when it’s useful and hard - working
witness announces, as he did at North
Brisbane, that 1400 working men are either
dead or gone aw ay—curiously enough no single
capitalist is ever either dead or gone away—it
never demands that he shall bring forward
any proof of this eminently improbable state-
ment ; it simply takes the statement on trust,
and if the 1400 are not there at the moment to
disprove the assertion, their names vanish from
the list. Obviously enough, they can’t be there.
If they were there every industry in the elec-
torate must stop that day for want of hands,
and the Patriotic League boss isn’t going to grant
a general holiday so that his employes may go
and upset the Patriotic League programme. It is
a great scheme, and seems to bear upon its brow
the imprint of the huge mutton fist of Thomas
MTlwraitu. For Griekith is thin and oily,
and his forte lies in wriggling round corners,
and getting through rat-holes, and undermining
his opponent unobserved, or else hiring a China-
man to bite him from behind ; while Ids
colleague rushes savagely at obstructions, and
squashes them down with his tremendous feet,
and jumps on them afterwards. And evidently
M‘l[. wraith hopes to prance, in his own in-
Htuned and apoplectic way, on the grave of Ilia
Labour-party after next general election.
The Directors’ Liability Bill, which is now
hanging tire in the Victorian Parliament, is the
sort of Act which is badly wanted all over Aus-
tralasia. It is, as its name implies, a measure
for fastening responsibility on the “guinea-pig'’
person who now affixes his respectable name to
fishy prospectuses, scoops in his fees as a director,
leads the public to waste their money in a wild-
cat enterprise simply because his unblemished
cognomen is assumed to be a guarantee of
solvency, and then escapes in the final smash
and the criminal trial which follows by proving
that he acted through ignorance and had no
share in any actual fraud. The theory of the
Bill is that, when a director, by put-
ting his name to a prospectus, guarantees
the statements contained therein, he must
take all responsibility for these state-
ments. If they are fraudulent, then it is
his fraud ; he claims to know and to have
control over the affairs of the company, and i f
these affairs are utterly rotten, then he is no
longer to escape by asserting that he was only
a fool who attached his name on trust, and a
liar who guaranteed something chat he knew
nothing about. If the enterprise goes wrong
because everything was left to the trusted
manager, and the manager took the cash, the
guinea-pig is to be held accountable for the
losses that ensue ; he is paid to supervise the
manager, and if he doesn’t do the work that
he is paid for, then it is his own look-out. A
good, healthy law of this kind, strictly adminis-
tered, will either make directors exceedingly
scarce and hard to find, or else it will make the
somnolent guinea-pig so active that the ordinary
manager will not be able to steal anything
larger than the stamps and a little petty cash.
By the Victorian “ Purification of Rolls Act” it
is laid down that no man convicted of an offence
against the law of the country shall be allowed
to vote for Parliament. An examination into
the character of holders of electoral rights has
resulted in the identification of no more than 1
in 15,000 liable to exclusion; that this is a gross
under statement is easily proved. In 1880
about 23,000 persons were sentenced by magis-
trates, for minor offences, to terms ranging from
two years downwards, while 680 others were
awarded various terms of imprisonment by judge
and jury verdicts. Bearing in mind that the
gross population of Victoria in the same
period averaged 1,104,300 souls we see that I
in 50 received punishment for lesser offences
and lin 1500 for graver crimes. Now, the
greater portion of criminality proceeds from (lie
male sex, and as the female half section of
society is the one which is denied voting power,
the apparent returns' of 1 in 50 and 1 in 1500
should be doubled, to adequately express the
criminality of those eligible to vote; but as then*
is every reason to believe that half the liberated
criminals never take the trouble to register, or
have means enough to qualify themselves for
electoral rights, by accepting the lesser esli
mate as the true one a fair average is attained.
On the basis of grave criminality alone dis-
qualifying the voting right, 10 in 15,000 should
have been struck off’ the rolls, but on the
indictment of all convicted of minor offences,
310 in 15,000 —in other words, say 2 per
cent. of the electors are disqualifiable.
Hence, either way the costly revision courts
have blundered. Looked at from the view ot
abstract justice it would appear that the man
who has expiated his sins is quite as much
entitled to a share in the regulation of his
country’s future business as he who has escaped
justice, or he who, having no practical ex peri
ence of the laws in existence, blindly assumes
that what is must be right. And, pray, what
finality is considered desirable in this arrange-
ment ? Is a youthful error to ban a man as a
pariah for the term of his natural life ‘i And
then, again, how about those refugees from out-
side, of whose careers no record is obtainable
Shall they vote after six months residence V
“ Yes, of course,” say the present idiotic law -
makers !
One of the ‘ ‘ libraries ” published by a
certain London publishing-house, and especially
recommended to the notice of parents and Sunday-
school superintendents as being of exceptional
purity of tone and healthiness of character, com-
prises 80 volumes. Every one of ’em is pirated.
The beauty of holiness !
Dear Bulletin, — I don’t know why
Organist Jude should write that he did good
business in Maryborough (0.). I did not say
otherwise, I merely remarked that they said he
could not play classical music. I mentioned this
to show their ignorance. An alleged “society"
which finds “Dr. Bill” and “Evangeline"
obscene, is well represented by a Lieutenant
Governor who would not take ladies to see
“Camille.” No wonder Organist Jude did nothing
in Brisbane until the Church took him in hand.
His show was too clean and too clever for
“ society.”—P. A.
The first man to suggest quartz-reefing on
Bendigo was that fine old journalist “Bob”
Haverfield. This was in ’54 —when lots of Bendi
gonians were convinced the district “ was worked
out.” The first company was, however, not
formed till ’57, the number of shares being 50 I
and the contributions five shillings per share per
week. Nearly all the primitive companies were
similarly organised ; for they meant business and
honourable business in those days ; and the wild-
cat promoter-the sort of creature who takes a
tall hand at running “National Associations"
when he has been successful in steering clear of
bigger sharps than himself —was then unknown.
Lord Compton, eldest sou of the Marquis
of Northampton, insured his life to the total tune
of .£34,500, as security for an advance of £lO,OOO
made by the insurance company, who must also
have had some security for the payment of pre-
miums. Compton was expected, in the ordinary
course of natme, to succeed to his father's estates,
repay the loan with interest, and close the
transaction. However, the heir died, whereupon
the noble Marquis, his father, sued the company
for the amount of insurance policies, less the
£lO,OOO and other moneys Chargeable upon them.
The end of the three law-suits is a final decision in
the House of Lords, by two noble Judges against
one noble Judge, in favour of the bereaved Mar-
quis. This is about the only case on record in
which a British nobleman has “ made a bit ” out
of the death of Ins prodigal son.

8-16 Macquarie-strcet North, Sydney, February 3, 1892
Mv Dkar Moorabinua, —
People overdo the smartest trick now and then, especi-
ally when they want to get loo’ard of the Custom House,
kor instance, some English friends recently sent a seven-
guinea boa to a well-known Sydney woman marked
'•tine three guineas” so that the duty this end
would be less. But, as luck would have it, the packet was
stolen and the company compensated according to its
hooked-value, of course; and three from seven leaves
four, you know, and honesty generally pans out best in
the long run.
Woman is woman’s natural foe—especially when a man
comes past. Which is the reason why a clique of damsels
in a certain Southern port wrote anonymously to the new
commission on board one of the warships warning the
officers of the damsels who were snags in the social
stream, and cataloguing themselves as the only girls
whom it was socially safe to waltz with at each and every
opportunity. On the whole, it was a bold personal adver-
tisement, and the end of it was that the dashing sons
of Neptune (this is what I call lovely writing) utterly dis-
regarded the muffled shrieks of warning and waltzed with
all the pretty girls who would dance with them. Con-
sidering what a Jack-in-lhe-hox the average naval man is
when attempting the teetotum whirl, it looks as if the
anonymous black-list of damsels might have been sent by
the damsels themselves as a sort of safeguard against the
bumps and collisions of nautical partners. Girls are so
artful.
A lady just from “Home” has wept all over my
Direotoire front and implored me to warn honest young
men against the unstamped syren of England who swoops
into the Kawliny, with a yearning expression and ten
trunks, and captures a Johnnie just as easily as if he were
a fly. Because said syrens are not always, like gentle
Jane, “ as good as gold,” and a few careful inquiries (we
all remember the fond parent who lost an A.D.C. for a
son-in-law on account of the clumsy gyrations of the
private detective he set on the track of his London
reputation) us to where she “ growed ” are quite indis-
pensable before you face the altar with a Beauteous
Being who may have dropped from Heaven or come up
in a thunderstorm from the other place for all you know
about her. Now I wouldn’t have thought out one of
these suspicions if it hadn’t been for the geniiinely-dis-
I ressed woman at the peak of these sorrowful remarks.
"I have had such a moral shock,” she said. “At the
So-au’-so’s I met a lady from England whose husband
is, to my certain knowledge, alive at this moment in
London. But the hostess called her by quite another
name, ‘Sirs. Blank,’ and by-and-bye her husband—her
Australian husband, that is—came into the room, and I
knew for a positive fact that she had committed bigamy !
Her local husband looked quite an honest, open-souled
man, deeply in love with her, I could see-and there is
the reason why Australian young men shouldn’t take
every English widow on her own parole, and I want you
to tell them so.” And the moral to be deduced from her
sobs is that men should want a reference with these
British butterflies, just as women should want a refer-
ence with all foreigners. A wife with one proprietor
already is bad enough, but what security has the confiding
Australee spouse of an English lass that 14 children (not
counting the twins) will not be carefully forwarded per
P. and O. directly she has been fixed ?
There is a fashion in fortune-telling as well as in frocks,
and the latest occult boom in Sydney is a veiled lady,
“daughter of a Sultan and born in a harem,” which is
the source of her mysterious knowledge, I suppose. A
Zenana once told me that the ladies of the Sultan’s house-
hold spend most of their time telling one another’s
fortunes, though you will diffidently imagine that when a
woman got into a harem she would consider her senti-
mental future pretty well mapped out, wouldn’t you? I
had a big chat with the witch—an Oriental being with
dark brown eyes, clad in a flowing lace mantilla conceal-
ing half her face—in her mystic retreat, the other day.
She only had the old story to tell of many impatient
people indulging in a stern chase after futurity and trying
to lasso their sweet-by-and-by, in a manner of speaking-
doctors, lawyers, artists—“ More men than women,” said
the Witoh—“ but the men all come about business or
racing, while with the women it’s jealousy about their
husbands, and the girls wants to know how true their
lovers are. Let me see your hand.” I held out a dainty
palm like a crumpled rose-leaf, and the witch took hold of
it, but I don’t know what she found there, for I never saw
such shapely little paws as hers—with one taper-finger
weighted with a seal ring set in diamonds—a Royal pre-
sent, I was told. Her hands reminded me of the magnetic
little fists of Sara B.
“Signalling by jewellery” is reported to be the latest
craze—but really there is nothing new under the sun.
Every woman wears her jewellery as a signal, from the
giggling girl with “Pet” on her brooch to the fat matron
with flabby neck creasing under the diamonds—each one
means it as a pointer to somewhere. The “ Pet” fastening
is a sure signal that the damsel is engaged and that the
brooch is Gussie’s love-gift-and the diamonds are a com-
meroial way of showing that the old man is keeping a
stiff commercial upper-lip, with no present intentionof
evading the sheriff.
And what a signal does the stage-favourite make of her
jewellery as she flashes it in what Harry Shine calls the
“lime jujoe I” It signals-that your homage is a very
unwelcoihe compliment if you don’t add another glitterer
to the harvest of jewels ; and what are wedding-rings but
danger-signals that someone has been first, and engage-
ment-circlets that somebody wants to be? Also, I want
to know who now wears earrings except to draw notice
to pretty cars, and why do all diamond shoe buckle
wearers have No. 1 feet?
The genius of the column of childish wit (just off the
10b ’ as "ere) in Sydney Echo ought to submit the
I'ioofs of these infantile japes to his grandmother, who
could tell him that most of them appeared in “Simple
. isan, the nursery-excitement in the days when George
the Fourth was King, or thereabouts. The latest sample
-about the bowl of pap, the infant, and the pig, with the
culminating witticism, “take a spoon, pig”—is verbatim
from that bygone book. Bub you don’t want the book
to pioie that the cynical brat up to date never did such
an illogical thing as to offer a spoon to a pig. “Where
would be the utility?” I can almost hear it argue—“the
poicine animal does not derive sustenance except through
natural media—nor are its vulgarly so-called trotters so
constructed that a spoon or ladle could be retained for'
the needful period.”
Considering that N.S.W. National Regatta has been
stolidly happening ever since goodness knows when, and
dab the mark of antiquity is on its wrinkled brow,
I might be accused of lack of veneration if I didn’t say
what a success the last one was, although Anniversary
Bay, 92, is quite ancient history already “George,” in
t ie same black tie, and Lord Precedence played lead, of
course, and many decent trackings clustered round the
sides of R M.S. Oriental, although one notices at regattas
where getting from vantage to vantage is quite a ques-
°f hionkey-climhing, that women cane more about
elocked-silk stockings and slick-fit shoes than anything
else. But two get-ups were gyp. One (worn by a Mary-
come-lataly just fresh from ’Ome) was of white ootele
worn with white kid shoes, white suede gloves and a
white felt hat with ostrich feathers; the other, of tan
corduroy trimmed with jewels, parasol in tan silk also
covered with jewels.
Talking about the Regatta, it is evident that most
people applaud a speech-maker on principle, or why
should the Admiral have been hand-clapped for his non-
committal ambiguities at the committee lunch on board
the flagship? He said “When they (of the Navy) went
to England they had much to tell of Australia, and thus
helped to make the people at Home know more about this
counti \ than would otherwise have been the case.” And
then they banged their palms at him as he sat down.
Now, his Excellency of the Queen’s Navee didn’t say what
the t.us leport about us, and, by the stony expression of
his eye, it seemed probable that he at least wouldn’t give
us a chaiacter when he’s once more at anchor in
Plymouth Sound, but still they said “Yah, yah,” all
round the festive board, and 1 felt glad to hear them.
They sounded so cock-sure, you know, that nobody could
“talk of Australia” in a fault-finding sense, and this
little fleeting revelation of the heights and depths of Aus-
tralian national conceit was distinctly edifying.
A soothing hour or so of melody liquefied by tea wr s
piovidjd by Mrs. Harry Woods, the well-known pianiste,
at Huenerbein’s music-gallery on the Block the otl e
afternoon. The palms on the platform, the walls covered
with really good pictures, and a crowd of nicely-dressed
women all led up to a more artistic wise oh scene than is
usual on such occasions-music and naked walls being
usually synonymous, in deference to the acoustics, of
course. Mrs, Woods is a timeist to the tips of her fingers,
and another virtue-she doesn’t make the composer go
her road, as so many artistes do, but follows his pegs
instead. Consequently her “bits” (Italian school prin-
cipally) made one sorry the programme only contained
three numbers.
The inky shrieks of a Sydney paper (with the pen point-
ing due Woolloomooioo-wards, of course) over the larri-
kinism of our ’arbour and “how ladies cannot go upon
the water for a ride” without being insulted by these low
characters who ought to be Flogged (with a big F) and so
on, emboldens your Sappho to rise and ask whether the
men who really insult women are the backwash of society
after all. The accepted “larrikin” is the Australian
\eisionof the scape-goat-everybody’s sins are piled on to
his narrow shoulders ! The sacred legend is that ladies
cannot go out in the evening unaccompanied, or in
certain parts’ of the city at any time, without being
accosted and insulted by the “ off-scourings of our civilisa-
tion,” but it is only a legend so far as it concerns the
off-scoured one, and no woman who doesn’t dawdle from
street to street and invite attention, has even occasion to
jump the gutter when a genuine hoodlum blocks the way.
As a matter of fact, the youth whom we have learned to
speak of as “ the larrikin ” is civil and obliging—marvel-
lously so considering his environment—and I have often
been quite touched when I asked him a question (no
woman of the world is ever afraid to do so) at his visible
inward struggle to frame a reply fit for the ear of a
“ lidy.” The person who annoys woman whenever the
chance presents itself, generally speaking, is not the
tight-trousered, high-heeled denizen of the kerb-stone
who wears braid on his coat and a tassel on his soft hat.
The real culprit is bald, sometimes with a heavy watch-
chain and a long hat, and he does the Block just about
the time the girls’ schools come out, or else he is young
and pimply and dressed in.baggy clothes and a button-
holer, and he trims a lamp-post until some girl inadvert-
. ently stops and looks intoashop window when he is heard
remarking at her elbow that it, is a lovely day, and didn’t he
meet her at Mr. Smith s? And if she is foolish enough to
admit that he did, a melodrama succeeds the Arcadian
prologue, probably, but, of course, nobody hears of it.
But because you never see a broad-cioth suit and a top-
hat laid across the knee of Justice is no reason why
broadcloths and bell-toppers should be outward and
visible signs of the white herb of virtue, is it? Nobody
points an indignant nib at the well-dressed larrikin,
simply because he passes his retribution on, as it were, to
the youth in the gutter, and when the latter is flogged or
strangled for acting like the dog of blackfellow' King
Billy, which worries the worthless leavings thrown to it
over its master s shoulder—the good, virtuous community
reads the evening papers and groans aloud over the
“ deplorable wickedness of the lower orders.”
And, carefully alluding to well-tailored larrikins, what
a rich field matrimonial advertisements and their subse-
quent sub-rosa assignments open up for the genus!
Common street-chases after possibly married sensible
women who may lead them a regular will o’ the wisp
hunt culminating in a police-station or a terrible snag < f
a hubby, can’t hold a match to the possibility of the
“ view matrimony ” advertisement. For, if the charmer
attends a rendezvous she and Lothario are birds of a
feather, and there is no uncertainty at all, though the
lady may be sometimes a little disconcerted at the per-
sonal appearance of her conquest. Nevertheless, the
sentimental ad. groweth in favour, for you can’t go to
the theatre without passing an obviously matrimonial-
ad. swain under every lamp-post. I have a vivid recol-
lection of the last one I saw-a pale-faced, middle-aged
man with dyed-purple whiskers (the dye" has never yet
been made which can’t be detected with one flicker of the
eyelash) surmounted by a tail, grey hat, standing on a
corner and ostentatiously twirling a white rose. I would
bet a horse to a hairpin she was to know him by that
virgin flower at the first rendezvous. Afterwards, I
suppose, she would recognise him at haif-a-mile by reason
of the hair-restorer,
Canst number the leaves on yonder tree ? or the hairs
on the heads of your familee? because if you can you will
probably compute just how big a mob squeezed into Sydney
Association Ground on the second day (Saturday) of the
England v. all-Australia bat-and-ball struggle. There
wasn’t a seat available on any of the three stands in the
afternoon, and late-comers like Yours Ever had to do the
stork act until some gracious male bounded into the air
and pressed ids perch upon them, which they always
accepted with much gratitude all the women say,
“ Oh, thank you so much,” now when a man gives
up his place to them—ever since the newspapers
noticed that they usen’t to. In such a raging human sea
it was quite impossible to grasp who had paid their little
half-crown, for people did not meander because there
were so many human beings waiting-to “jump” their
chairs, and the only rush that occurred was into the tea-
room at four o’clock when I saw the fetching' Marie Fraser
in a white dot muslin and a black hat with a pansy in if,
smiling seraphicaliy at a bun while her handsome cavalier
rushed wildly round for a fork. Other people surged in
pursuit of the death-dealing tart and the saddle-coloured
beverage, and in the maelstrom I glimpsed Miss Nellie
Hill, in a white jacket and a pied band round a sailor hat;
Mrs. Dick Teece in a strawberry corduroy with a white
vest, butterfly bonnet in green and strawberry; Mrs.
Sams in a delicate pale-green, mingled with cream silk,
green bengaline and gold braid, airy bonnet en suite;
Miss Sams in fawn cotele, hat in black and gold and pink >
Mrs. Francis Adams in black grenadine over shot-red silk ;
the Misses Throckmorton—the engagement is announced
of the eldest sister to Major Churchward (which is a good
marrying sort of a name)'—in white gowns ; Miss Want in
black. There were rumours, too, of a trio of titled women
and other heavy swells from the Big Smoke being on the
field, but no special halo seemed to balance over the
bonnets and belltoppers of these exalted Beings from
’Ome, so you couldn’t tree them even with a spy-glass.
Professional Sydnej’ was hugely there, and it was deeply
interesting to see an actress, who ran such a rig ever so
lang syne with one or two well-known Benedicts, strolling
confidently on the gravel in the members’ reserve, while
one at least of her former friends “ sat ” rigidly by the

Nobody at that moment.
In “ Forty-Nine,” at Her Majesty’s (a badly-named play
to take a virgin to, “standing with be-bunioned feet
where middle-age and old-age meet,” don’t you think ?),
Madge Seymour wore a cream-coloured ethereal evening-
dress in act last, with a diamond spray in her hair.
Maggie Moore’s clever jugglery with black velvet
streamers on her yellow gown, in the same scene, ought
to be prayerfully studied by every plump-figured charmer
who would fain avoid even the very appearance of avoir-
dupois. In the prompt-box, Kate Bishop, in cream, and
M atts-Phillips, in black, charmingly represented the man-
agement, and a weak sensation was caused in the d.c. by
a strapping pressman from Melbourne crawling under the
draperies round the vice-regal enclosure as a short dive to
somewhere.
Of the two songs “Scottish Emigrant” and “Tired
Mother” (sent to me by the composers, J. and M. Robert-
son, of Maoriland), the first-named is full of those sudden
semi quavers that make singing a Hielan’ sang, ye ken,
and dislocation of the jaw synonymous, so it ought to
boom in kilted circles. It has eight verses and the melody
never varies, so people who like songs by the hundred-
weight are confidently invited to inspect. The second
song, “Tired Mother,” is a pretty, soothing lullaby
calculated to send the most fractious infant to the land
of Nod, and ending on a note which is artistically soft and
low. Most alleged lullabies end with a yell on the top
branch loud enough to arouse the god Murphy himself. But
in neither of the songs is there originality of words or
music.
Yours affectionately,

Dp to date £4,090,000 dividends have been dis-
tributed in all, in addition to £1,744,000 in shares

The late Dean Donaghy, of Victoria, died
possessed of twopence. All through his long life
he usually had twopence—sometimes less—very
seldom more. When his funds got up above the
high-water mark of these two lonesome coppers he
usually gave the surplus to the poor. He left no
will—no executors—no visible fortune of any kind,
but his sorrowing friends looked into the waist-
coat pocket of the departed, and there his entire
worldly wealth was discovered. He that giveth
to the poor lendeth to the Lord, and Donaghy has
doubtless gone to collect a long bill on the golden
shore—if there is any shore.

the place; it is certainly the largest and best-
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there, so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*

At Her Majesty’s on Saturday last Maggie
Moore and William Rignold appeared in what
the play-bills called a “ thrilling comedy-drama.”
in a prologue and three acts, entitled “ Forty -
ISine. ’ There was a very good house, and the
piece presented should have a decent run, as it
belongs to that type of song-and-dance and
variety-show sensation so dearly loved by the
average Sydney play-goer. It 'is hardly calou-
Jated to draw a continuously-filled dress-circle
but managers tell you that when the other parts
of the house are crowded, dress-circles matter very
(I m, wa y' The Pi ece > s ;l compromise between
ihe Miner’s Daughter,” “ The Danites,” “My
partner,’ and “ Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” from which
last-named play it borrows a pious nigger with a
snuffle and a forelock of white horse-hair. The
heroine, known by the sobriquet of “Carrots”
- it s a case this time of corned beef and carrots—
has been dragged up by the keeper of a Rocky
Mountains shanty. “ Carrots ” is, moreover, an
heiress ; and a good young man, who gives himself
away at every possible opportunity, and who
wears a stove-pipe hat and a suit of Broadway
clothes in a Far West mining camp, falls in love
with her, without knowing anything about her
prospects. A bad young man, who likewise
indulges in transparent scheming, is also on the
trail, and marries the wrong woman in the hope
of annexing the millions. “Forty-nine ”is an old
miner who tunnels into the bowels of the earth
for 25 years, and who stands a fair chance of
being hanged by the Vigilantes in the abysses of
a sunless gulch for a crime he didn’t commit,
ibis picturesque and red-shirted patriarch
is the protector of “Carroty” and the father
of the good young man to whom he makes
over the millions in the tunnel on condition
that he marries the girl whose identity with
the lost heiress is established by the pious nigger
through the medium of a camp-meeting bymnlet,
upon which everybody settles down to cham-
pagne, broadcloth, low-necked dresses, broken
Trench and Delrnonico suppers for the term of
their natural lives, after the wrong heiress has
obtained a divorce and the bad young man has
been sent to Sing Sing.

Most of the business takes place in a Far
West shanty, the bar of which is fitted up like the
Australia’s ’ with alabaster pillars and hangings
of damask, and sapphire, amethyst and jasper
fixings, and various splendours far surpassing the
material joys of the New Jerusalem. William
Rignold as “Old Forty-Nine’’ has all the fat of
the show and makes the most of it, not withstand-
ing the fact that the piece is crammed with dreary
Yankee stage-gags and various literary dri veilings
of ghastly commonplace. Maggie Moore, although
somewhat too fleshy for the part of “Carrots,”
has songs, dances and catchy variety-show busi-
ness, mixed up with cheek and pathos of a
homely brew, that give her a grip on the audience
from beginning to end ; while J. W. Sweeney as a
permanently thirsty dead-beat, and G. P. Carey
as Uncle Tom, the pious nigger, are about evenly
placed, and, after the principals, deserving of
special mention. H. R. Jewett is the good young
man of the show, and has so many pious plati-
tudes, and so much romantic nonsense to dis-
burden his soul of, that it is a wonder he doesn’t
collapse before the curtain falls on the last act.
The situations in “ Forty-Nine ” are highly
dramatic, but the dialogue is feeble and the gags
are out of date.

The “Forty Thieves” are still at work
at Sydney Royal, but they are getting nightly
more monotonous in their ineffable gorgeousness,
and the great sovereign public yearn, like the
succulent bivalve, for something different from
the oyster-knife. The unspeakable Graggs have
added a new storey to their human edifice, and
periodically execute convolutionary eccentricities
that remind us painfully of the nightmares of our
youth. Also the Fairy Four have donned
bonnets and accepted the responsibilities of busi-
ness entirely novel, and the Captain of the
“ Forty ” has invested in anew uniform. Every-
body is flourishing like a green bay-tree, and like-
wise deep regrets are fostered that the pantomime
is coming to a speedy conclusion, and that nether
limbs will be consigned to a region unacquainted
with limelight, and beyond the fociW of the
masher’s glass
** * *
“ Uncles and Aunts,” at the Criterion, con-
tinues in a dolorously energetic fashion to heap
contempt upon the ancient perspn who wears a
wig, and to destroy youth’s fond illusions respect-
ing the sanctity of gray hairs. Cannam improves
upon a closer acquaintance and becomes more
deliciously unctuous with each time of asking. If
this sort of thing continues, R. Brough will need to
look to his laurels, and make fresh arrangements
for a new comedian. Not that R. Brough, of that
ilk, is ineffective—far from it. He holds up one
end of the show in a drily humorous fashion,
which leaves nothing to the reader of the play-bill
to complain of. One of the most artistic people in
the cast is George Lash Gordon, whose Bates,
albeit a trifle, is_as clean-cut as anyone can desire.
Miss Brenda Gibson is reasonably pleasant, and
Miss Marie Fraser tries conscientiously to be the
same. This young lady is very graceful and wears
her clothes well, but she has, unfortunately for
stage purposes, a little too much throat in her
voice, which is a handicap that even Sims Reeves
couldn’t successfully hold up against. Mr. Fabert.
advertised as a recent importation in the comedy
line, gets better with each performance, although
he will, with much endeavour, hardly ever equal
some actors we wot of, whose recent arrivalship
has not been quite so much nOtorialised.

Afc the Garrick Theatre, on Saturday last,
Bridget O’Brien, Esq.,_ opened a short season of
John F. Sheridan. This piece has been so often
described, and the merits of the actors taking part
in it so frequently commented upon in the columns
of The Bulletin, that further remark is superero-
gatory. If the Polytechnic management really
desire to make the fighting kangaroo a draw, it
should match the plucky little marsupial with
somebody nearer its own size. A feather-weight
boxer would b.e an admirable substitute for the
robustious and burly pugilist who at present
mauls the gentle eyed creature about the stage.

“ Evangeline ” has been doing moderate
business at Melbourne Alexandra for the past
week or so, the celebrated sixpenny gallery of this
establishment being always crowded and generous
with its shrill note of admiration. Coming
immediately after a weak pantomime, “Evan-
geline ” seems a tolerably lively entertainment at
popular prices. Sundry incidental apparitions,
such as the whales and the heifer, don’t shock
one’s feelings as they did aforetime, when the
show was unfavourably contrasted with the
splendour of its advance puffs in the daily press.
A full-sized orchestra does full justice to Rice’s
collection of tinkling melodies, the chorus-singing
is good enough, and the general scenic effect is
assisted by exceptionally clever manipulation of
the lights” Most of the old people are still
struggling after humour in their original parts.
TheJjone Fisherman appears to possess charms for
the young; in fact, the mirth of the gallery when
that perennial dumb-mute catches a property eel
with a crust of bread is simply awful. Catherine
is back again, too, and although the huge object
in skirts is more subdued and thoughtful than of
yore she (or rather he) provides the eye with
plenty to rest upon when it is weary. John Ford,
however, is a less satisfactory foil for the stout
gentleman than Gourlay, so in this important
respect the beautiful story of “ Evangeline ” has
lost a little of its subtle humour. Otherwise the
strength of the patient is fully maintained, as
they observe in medical bulletins. Virginia Earl,
of the well-shaped knees, turns her little bit of
voice to good account, Fanny Liddiard is singing
sweetly, and the glittering amazons glitter much
the same as they did on the narrower stage of the
Opera House. Probably “ The Corsair ” will be
put up on Saturday night.

Other theatres are travelling on last week’s
tickets. Elton and “The Old Guard” have
neither died nor surrendered at the Princess’, and
the ballet fetches them as though it were an abso-
lutely new revelation in legs
At time of writing it was not certain or very
likely that “ La Cigale ” would be ready for pro-
duction on Saturday. In the event of this
momentous novelty being held back for another
coat of varnish, it is possible that “Cloches de
Corneville ” may pop up in place of “The Old
Guard,” but the present bill would fill up the
interval satisfactorily anyway.

“ Dick Whittington ” had another profit-
able week at the Royal, and the proprietor of the
Age is said to be losing flesh rapidly. Further-
more, there arc rumours afloat to tins effect that the
staff of the boycotting journal are losing all their
decayed teeth through gnashing them, and that
one of the special reporters was found dead in
bed, under an impression that he had suspended
himself by the Royal free-list from a hook in the
ceiling, But these stories go for what they are
worth, which is just how the panto, is going.
Unfortunately, Billee Barlow has been suffering

Shakespeare still toddles along at Mel-
bourne Bijou, and the management has taken to
announcing that “ Much Ado about Nothing ” is
not for an age, but for all time—which sounds
like an uncommonly long run for this worthy
show. Meanwhile, “ Much AdoI’has 1 ’has got as far
as its sixth week without the date of withdrawal
being referred to, so the Immortal Bard is evi-
dently backing himself to put up an Australian
record, and B. and B. are holding the stakes.

The patient spider and the small pene-
trating insect that loves to build its nest in dark
places have received .notice to quit Melbourne
Opera House. The place is getting itself cleaned
once more, and the shutters will come down on
February 13 (probably), when George Musgrove is
to open proceedings with his new Empire Com-
pany, Harry Musgrove, long-time treasurer at
the Princess’, has left the old shop, in order to
come and look after things for his brother. Things
require a lot of looking after in front of the Opera
House, and the brethren had better hire a few
sportsmen to shoot around that preserve of
welslicrs as soon as possible. ,
The Hans Phillips bene tit matinee, at the
Bijou, was a fair success. Also a farewell to
Madame Oarandini which was to happen at the
Town Hall last (Wednesday) night, promised to
pan out well. At the Exhibition Concert and
other shows there were good houses on Saturday,
and the departure of Sells’ Circus seemed to be
filling a long-felt want.

Still harping on benefits—Miss Clara
Merivale is to be “complimented” on Saturday
afternoon (Feb. 6) by a strong, all-round perform-
ance, under the patronage of His Excellency who
lias kindly volunteered to sit down and smile upon
the occasion. The Bijou is the selected house
again, but the public are getting tired of bens, at
the Bijou.
That foremost girl in yellow’s
Adored by all the fellows ;
The smaller nymph in green
Kicks wondrous sweet and clean ;
Their mashers, dressed as boys,
Are also fleeting joys ;
The darlings in the rear,
Though far, are very dear,
And all the lot are clever
And comforting as ever.
At Poverty Point.
A certain pretty little prima donna lately stamped a
dainty hooflec and demanded a rise to £3O a week. But
the great man’s dark eyes glittered ominously, and, fear-
ful of being swallowed alive, the diminutive nightingale
fled to a safe distance, then tossed her head with queenly
contempt—and sent in her resignation. But the big
person only chuckled, for had not a new and larger prima
donna just arrived in the country ?
When, a month or two ago, it was broadly insinuated
that a certain Prince made the acquaintance of (the
suicided) Miss Lydia Manton behind the scenes at London
Gaiety, the manager wrote to the press that such an
occurrence was impossible—there was no place where such
propriety was observed. We now notice that in the
report of the St. John divorce-case Miss St. John’s mother
admits that a Mr. Arthur Cohen was on the Gaiety stage
on several occasions, and it Is sworn that Cohen often
went into St. John’s dressing-room while she was
changing.
The Mrs. G. B. Lewis ben., at Melbourne Bijou, yielded
very little profit. Times are bad, also there was an
erroneous idea abroad that the Lewises were going
“ home” with a pile and didn’t require an extra hundred
or two. The unfortunate fact of the matter is that
G.B.L. has lost most of his little bit of money in the
recent panic smashes, and the laiy hopes to assist matters
by getting a London engagement.
Writes a correspondent:—“ Poor Pros, should be
warned against a back-blocks manager who goes about
the shearing-sheds with half-a-dozen people in a waggon.
He engages performers in the city at so much a night,
every night they play. The average is about one or two
nights a week. He says, “ Whenever it is impossible to
get to a hotel we camp out; ’ but when he gets the un-
fortunate crowd out in the bush the rule is changed. It
is : ‘ Whenever it is impossible to camp out we go to a
hotel.’ Once in camp, corned beef and bread is the fare,
washed down by milkless tea often made from a water-.-
hole wherein sheep and bullocks drink and bathe by
turns. The ladies must cook ami wash for (lie crowd or
be turned adrift. The last, crowd ho took out was turned
loose over 500 miles from town, coach and rail, and the
people, who had played about four weeks in five months,
had to pay their own fare of £4, out of their scanty
savings, though they were all promised a return fare to
town.”
A dramatic company visited a northern N.S.W. town
lately, but owing to the narrow-minded prejudice of the
hoteikeepers, none could be found to take them in. The
men of the show camped in the hall. They spread the
wardrobe on the floor for couches, and used the Box and
Cox gridiron for such chops and steaks as they could get
on time-payment. The ladies, however, could not be
expected to face this sort of thing, so a kind-hearted
publican took them in, on the strict understanding that
he was to be paid. Of course, the manager vowed eternal
gratitude and prompt pay, but, alas, the Boniface was left
in the soup. And now when an advance-agent heaves in
s'ght the hoots is posted at the hall-door with a shot-gun,
and even an offer of spot cash will not persuade him to
allow even a bill in the bar.
Theatrical affairs in Australia seem to he entirely on

W. S. Gilbert was the originator of “ Billee ” Barlow’s
front name, at a time when they happened to be fellow-
passengers aboard ship. The damsel, who bad been Lily
Barlow hitherto, promptly adopted the great man’s joke-
let to stage circumstances, and became a novel feature on
the bill right away. An odd name is always worth some-
thing to a public performer. Young Norwood, who
recently hooked and hied away to England, was only
remarkable for being Eille. As Norwood lie attracted no
attention, bub in the capacity of Eille, he was a haunting
reminder of Irish drama and Scotch whisky.

It was at a back-blocks concert held in the schoolroom.
The lights were dim and flickering, the crowd was dense,
the singers were mostly nervous, and the chairman was
illiterate, near-sighted, and in a profuse state of perspira-
tion. Also one of the performers got scared at a critical
moment, and fled from the scene rather than get on the
platform. Somebody had just finished a song, and the
chairman was trying to decipher the next item on the
programme. “ Mr. Smith,” he said, solemnly, “ will now
sing ‘God Save the Weasel.’” “Mr. Smith’s gone,”
ejaculated his left-hand supporter hurriedly. “In that
case Mr. Jones will play ‘ Pop goes the Queen.’ ”

Frau Marie Wilt, the great singer, who suicided the
other day in Vienna, had an exquisite voice, and was for
many years the great draw at the Vienna Opera House.
She was very short and very stout ; her figure was shaped
like a coffin or an exceedingly thick pump ; she had no
eye-lashes and no eyebrows, and her small, grey, pig-like
eyes were buried in great mounds of flesh, while her
cheeks hung down like bags. But her vocalisation made
up for everything, and the people of Vienna adored her
till the day of her death.
Paderewski, the Polish violinist, is gushed about by a
New York critic as follows —“Paderewski's head is
‘delicately poised on a throat as white as a virgin’s;’
‘ his nimbus of hair is indescribably coloured : ‘his com-
plexion is the sulphur that lurks in the heart of the white
rose,’ and his touch ‘is original - languidly tired in
Chopin’s nocturnes, fiercely powerful in Lisztian rhapso-
dies, and velvet and golden in broad cantilena.’” Me
hope this isn’t true. It sounds like the description of the
much-bangled she-gentleman with the gold-washed head,
who has made us all feel tired at some period or other of
our lives.
Madam Marie Roze says;—“ A girl who has any regard
for her voice cannot be too careful when going out into the
open-air in her wraps, and especially in the manner in
which she protects her chest and throat. Another im-
portant thing is rest—and plenty of it. As to diet, she
should avoid sweets of all kinds. Pastry, nuts, almonds,
raisins, pickles, rich sauces, are simply poison to a singer.
As regards fluids, all are harmful, if taken in immoderate
quantities. Milk is good, hut it is best mixed with soda-
water or seltzsr. Wines of any kind are injurious, and I
cannot be too emphatic in warning all girls who aspire to
he singers to abstain from them. I have Known some of
the most promising voices to be utterly ruined by even
the smallest indulgence in wine. Fresh and ripe fruit
always make a very good diet for a singer, especially
grapes. Very often, almost daily, I might say, I eat a
pound of grapes, and find them the best possible tonic
for the vocal chords.” Evidently a voice is as much
trouble as a white elephant or a mangled corpse hidden
under the bed.

pinch-faced, sharp-set, snappy-voiced, thin Cardinal-Mann-
ing-looking woman. Dizzy wrote: “The critics are those
who have failed in literature or art ’’—and Marches! failed
as a singer.
Boucicault wrote on the MSS of Reade’s “ Never Too

The champion dead-head. Howard Paul’s hotel land-

All very well giving poor Clara Merivale a ben., bu'

Sara Bernhardt’s falls are all dependent on the leading
man. So explains a New York paper, and she would hurt
her head badly, in “Camille,” if Armand didn’t catch her

Jean de Reszke, Melba’s late tenor, rushes to America.
He is rather like Sass to look at; his brother Edouard,
basso, is not unlike Kowalski.
Harry Jackson used to show a scar between his eyes
from Lola Montes’ dagger, which she always carried, the
blow being delivered behind the scenes in Adelaide, but
it was meant for Folland, the comedian, who afterwards
drowned himself on this woman’s account. In Australia
she looked rather like Madame Celeste.
Mr. Ben. Barber, of the Australian Star, will shortly
have a play of his, “Devotion,” staged in Sydney. Ben-
iamin should evidence the possession of a boundless
imagination. He used, we are credibly informed—hats off

Our London correspondent says that had the acting
been half as good as the play itself Haddon Chambers
would have secured a brilliant success with “ The
Honourable Herbert,” performed for the first time on
22nd Dec. at the Vaudeville. As it is, he is to be con-
gratulated on having produced a really beautiful play,
which will certainly enhance his growing reputation. The
London papers are much divided in opinion concerning
the play.
The latest fashion in Melbourne “ booms ’
is the oyster-saloon row. Sometimes there’s a

Messrs Evans and Chandler, proprietors of
Adelaide Quiz, have been committed for
libelling Gerald and Duff, who are taking civil
libel-suits against the two Adelaide dailies.
Queen Victoria was, some time ago,
appointed by the Kaiser honorary Colonel of a
German Regiment. The other day a Lieut.-
Colonel arrived at Windsor who had travelled all
the way from Berlin with a servant, for the pur-
pose of personally reporting to his military
superior Queen Victoria his appointment to the
sub-command of the regiment !
Canon Liddon : “I have read something
of church history and find that the church cause
is always triumphant in islands rather than on
the mainland. Quite true. How gospel-
ground are the Norfolk Islanders and the Tas-
manians ; and look at the poor South Sea Islander
with a parson’s thumb on his carotid artery all the
time!
The N.S.W. “National” Association is
just about to promulgate a new scheme of com-
prehensive organization in which they are having
the support of certain pseudo-radicals who are
bartering their alleged principles for cash. Not
that The Bulletin blames either the Association
or the sham democrats. After all, political
organization is a mere matter of business - a point
which the workers are slow to recognise. So long
as they are content with the organization com-
posed purely of their own section of society so
long will they be beaten by money which hires
brain-power.
Chapman and Hall, London publishers,
pay <£2oo, under jury verdict, because one of
their authors clapped a real personage into a novel,
wherefore Yates moralises on this practice by
Dickens. He caricatured his own father in
“Micawber,”and his mother in Mrs. Nickleby, and
was surprised they never could see it, and he took
off Landor and Leigh Hunt offensively, in the
Boythorn and Harold Skimpole of “ Bleak
House,” while Yates himself put all his comrades
at the Post Office, by their real names, though
not portraits, in one of his novels. Thackeray,
however, was more liberal in this way than any.
We have heard Richard Birnie, of Melbourne’s
last generation, boast that Thackeray took him
off, though it was in an odious kind of way.
Then there is Disraeli, with swarms of portraits :
Bute, Manning, Croker, Palmerston, Gladstone,
&c. &c.

How Polly Paid for Her Keep.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Do I know Fully Brown ? Do I know her? Why,
damme,
You might as well ask if I know my own name?
Jl s a wonder you never heard tell of old Sammy,
Her father, my mate in the Crackenbaek claim.
He asks if I know little Poll! Why I nursed her
As often, I reckon, as old mother Brown
'Vhen they lived at the “Flats,” and old Sain
went a burster
In Ohinaman’s Gully, and dropped every crown.
My golden haired mate, ever brimful of folly
And childish conceit, and yet ready to rest
Contented beside me, ’twas I who taught Polly
To handle four horses along with the best.
Twas funny to hear the small fairy discoursing
Of horses and drivers, 111 swear that she knew
I'lvery one of the nags that I drove to the “ Cros-
sing,”
Their vices and paces and pedigrees too.
She got a strange whim in her golden-haired
noddle
That a driver’s high seat was a kind of a throne,
I’ve taken her up there, before she could toddle.
And she’d talk to the nags in.a tongue of her
own.
Then old Mother Brown got the “horrors” around
her
(I think it was pineapple-rum drove her daft),
She cleared out one night, and next morning they
found her,
A mummified mass, in a forty-foot shaft.
And Sammy? well, Sammy was wailing and
weeping,
And raving, and raising the devil’s own row ;
He was only too glad to give into our keeping
His motherless babe—we’d have kept her till
now
But Jimmy Maloney thought proper to court her,
Among all the lasses he loved but this one.
She’s no longer Polly, our golden-haired daughter,
She's Mrs. Maloney, of Packsaddle Run.
Our little girl Polly’s no end of a swell (you
Must know Jimmy shears fifty-thousand odd
sheep)—
But I’m clean off the track, I was going to tell you
The way in which Polly paid us for her keep.
It was this way : My wife’s living in Turn-
barumba.
And I'm down at Germanton yards, for a sale,
Impacting coach-horses (I wanted a number),
When they flashed down a message that made
me turn pale.
Twas from Polly, to say that the old wife had
fallen
Down stairs, and in falling had fractured a
bone—
There was no doctor nearer than Tumut to call
on,
So she and the blacksmith had set it alone.
They’d have to come down by the coach in the
morning
As one of the two buggy ponies was lame,
Would I see the old doctor, and give him fair
warning
To keep himself decently straight till they
came ?
1 was making good money those times, and a fiver
Per week was the wages my deputy got,
A good, honest worker, an out-and-out driver,
But like all the rest a most terrible sot.
So, just on this morning, which made it more
sinful,
With my women on board, the unprincipled
skunk
Hung round all the bars till he loaded a skinful
Of grog, and then starts on his journey, dead
drunk.
Drunk ! with my loved ones on board, drunk as
Chloe,
He might have got right by the end of the trip
Had he rested contented and quiet, but no, he
Must pull up at Rosewood, for one other nip.
That finished him off, quick, and there he sat,
dozing,
Like an owl on his perch, half-awake, half-
asleep,
Till a lurch of the coach came, when, suddenly
losing
His balance, he fell to earth all of a heap,
While the coach, with its four frightened horses,
went sailing
Downhill to perdition, and Carabost “break,”*
Four galloping devils, with reins loosely trailing,
And passengers falling all roads in their wake.
Two bagmen, who sat on the box, jumped together
And found a soft bed in the mud of the drain ;
The barmaid from Murphy’-efell lightas a feather —
1 think she got off with a bit of a sprain ;
While the jock, with his nerves most decidedly
shaken,
Made straight for the door, never wasting his
breath
In farewell apologies ; basely forsaken,
My wife and Poll Brown sat alone with grim
death.
While the coach thundered downward, my wife
fell a-praying,
But Poll in a fix now is dashed hard to beat;
She picked up her skirts, scrambled over the
swaying,
High roof of the coach, till she lit on the seat,
And there looked around. In her hand was a
pretty,.
Frail thing made of laces, with which a girl
strives
To save her complexion when down in the city—
A lace parasol ! yet it saved both their lives.
Oli, Polly was game, you may bet your last dollar.
She leans on the splashboard, and stretches and
strains
With her parasol, down by the off-sider’s collar,
Until she contrives to catch hold of the reins.
They lay quite secure in the crook of the handle,
She clutched them—the parasol fell underneath.
I tell you no girl ever could hold a candle
To Poll, as she hung back and clenched her
white teeth.
The bolters sped downward, with nostrils dis-
tended,
She must get a pull on them ere they should
reach
The fence on the hill, where the road had been
mended;
The blocks bit the wheels with a “ scroope” and
a screech.
The little blue veins in her arms swelled and
blackened,
The reins were like fiddle-strings stretched in
.... h fr grip,
When the “break” hove in sight, the mad gallop
had slackened,
She’d done it, my word, they were under the
whip.
They still had the pace on, but Polly was able
To steer ’twixt the fences, with never a graze,
They flashed past the “ Change ” where the groom
at the stable
Just stood with his mouth open, dumb with
amaze.
On the level she turned them, the best bit of
driving
That ever was done on this side of the range,
And trotted them back up the hill-side, arriving
With not a strap broken in front of the
“ Change.”
And the wife? —well, she prayed to the Lord till
she fainted;
I reckon He answered her prayers all the same—
He must have helped Polly, it’s curious now,
ain’t it,
To see a thin slip of a girl be so game ?
Did I summons the driver? I had no occasion—
The coroner came with a jury instead,
THE BOOT OF THE PERIOD.
Who found that he died from a serious abrasion —
Both wheels of the coach had gone over his
head.
BARCROFT H. BOAKE.
Where a mail road passes through a fence it is cus-
tomary to dispense with a gate, a lane being built on either
side of the opening instead, which goes by the name of
a “ break.”

—New Novel.
Cabled that Lord Tennyson—we must
quote the “Lord ” in this connection—has written
“a fine poem” on the death of the Duke of
Clarence. No matter :he wrote “ Crossing the
Bar.”
He is a well-known (and much loved) news-
paper-proprietor, and he dropped into the shop of
one of the suburban news-agents the other night.
Noticing some copies of the Scientific American
and other Yankee publications on the counter, he
asked the agent “why he kept those papers?”
“Keep them? Why, I get through a good
many!” - it, man,” quoth the indignant
prop., “ that injures my weekly !” Four-sevenths
of his paper’s contents are taken bodily from the
American journals—that’s where the injury comes
in.
The first religious service in Horsham
(Vic.) was hold in the police-station. The same
could be said of many other townships, but there
were two peculiarities about the Horsham service.
The preacher knew exactly six words of English—
“ Good day !” “ God bless you !” and “ Thanks !”
—and the congregation of seven did not know a
word of German, the preacher’s language. That
was peculiarity the first; and the second was that
the walls of the “ chapel ” were papered with pro-
clamations offering rewards for arrest of criminals
aggregating i!2000.
“London Day by Day” in the Lawson -
Levy’s D.T. is for the most part a dry-hash record
of the “movements ” of Hingland’s hold nobility.
It starts off with the joyful intelligence that V.R.
is expected in the metropolis shortly, and gradually
drops down to such items as “ Lord William
Nevill is much better,” and “Lady Newtown-
Butler passed a quiet night.” Perchance the
death of an M.P. may be mentioned “with
regret,” but nothing unpleasant in the way of
starvation or vulgar suffering ever troubles
“ London Day by Day.”

“ Yetus,” says a private letter from Lon-

by General Chesney and Colonel Maurice.
A. Java planter, who died recently, left all
his property by will to the Devil. We have not
yet heard on what date Sir Henry leaves for Java.
Several of the papers reprint as genuine
the Dick Lee-invented letter in which W. G.
Grace is alleged to have maligned the “ colonials.”
Speaker Abbott is disappointed because he
was not promoted to the President’s Chair in the
N.S. W. nominee Council. He “kicks ”at the long
sittings of the Assembly.
Mrs. Osborne, the disgraced heroine of
the English missing pearls trial, is a god-
daughter of Sir Henry James, Q.C., who really
forced the action into court. She must have lied
to James.
Among the applicants for the post of
secretary to the Victorian Agent-General, was an
individual who was just out of gaol after serving a
term for a big building society swindle. How is
that for gall ?
Graham Berry returns with four grown-up
daughters and two children. The young ladies
are those of whom the complaint was made that
he sent them to the Prahran State school while he
was Premier.
Rev. Dr. Steel, of Sydney, was the first
editor of Meliora, a London magazine long since
defunct, but sets of which are greatly valued,
because of the remarkable quality of many of its
sociological papers.
The subscribers’ edition of John Farrell’s
poems (which originally appeared in and were
written for The Bulletin) has been long out of
print. A copy was sold the other day for three
times the published price.
CL W. Rusden finished his “History of
Australia ” sitting in the library of Wotton House,
the home of John Evelyn, the classic English
essayist and diarist. He began it 20 years before
at his own house at Brighton, Victoria.
Sir Henry Parkes surprised the habitues
of N.B.W. Assembly lately by holding a long
tete-d-tStc with his son Varney. Beyond exchang-
ing a passing remark, Sir Henry has never been
noticed to converse with his sonin thechamber.
Twelve years ago Frank Suttor, as
Minister of Justice, called upon Tom Slattery to
show cause why he should not be dismissed the
N.S.W. public service. The Minister and his
quasi-subor linate officer of 1880 are now Minis-
terial colleagues under George Dibbs.
No Prince of Wales, as Prince of Wales,
has lived to see one of his sons marry—and the
title is (500 years o'd. If Her Gracious and Bertie
are at all superstitious they will hasten young
George to the altar and break the spell. A
late cable says he is seriously unwell.
John Macintosh, M.L C. (N.S.W.), began
his Australian career as a wharf-lumper at Port
Jackson. He now thinks a wharf owner and a
wharf lumper are not equal factors in the body
politic : The man with the visible asset is equal to
two men with no capital but their labour.
The late Sir John Hay (N.S.W.) lost
c£l(>,000 through the operations of the Mercantile
Bank, Sydney, which he helped to establish.
Many personal friends, trusting to his good judg-
ment, bought into the bank, and lost heavily with
him. Sir John brooded constantly over the mis-
fortune into which he had unwittingly led his
friends.
Howard Willoughby has reprinted three
books from the pages of the Argus ; James
Smith, two. Strange that Willoughby’s “Pictures
of Australia,” written for the Religious Tract
Society, is such poor literature compared with his
ephemeral contributions. But then just think how
he had to hold himself in leash when writing for—
a Tract Society !
There is a legend that when Parkes was
emigration-lecturing at Birmingham in 18(12, a
workman arose and said: “Mr. Parkes gets
idooo a year to tell you this—don’t believe him.’’
“You are a liar,” said Parkes, A number of
others arose ’mid much hubbub to corroborate th«
accusation. “ You’re all wrong,” said Henry
“ my salary is <£1200.”
I*. O. Fysh, the Tasmanian Premier
started life as an errand-boy in the little drapery
store which Stevenson and Sons ran in Elizabeth
street, Hobart, in the good old days. When tin,
Stevensons gave up the retail business, P. O. Eyg],
was employed in their warehouse in Collins-street,
and he succeeded to the Tasmanian business when
the firm removed to Melbourne.
Not another man in W.A. has had equal
opportunities with Premier Forrest to become
rich. He has a big land-grant from the Govern-
ment for his exploring trip of ’76, which ho
promptly turned into cash. He and his brothers
secured the best of the land upon the Upper Mur-
chison, since sold to Victorians, and upon which
are some of the best sheep-stations in the pro-
vince.
Editor Haddon completes his 25th year in
the chair of the Argus. That which pleases long
and pleases many must possess some merit, says
Doctor Johnson. Jas. Smith, doyen of the shop,
says he has served under nine dynasties of Argus
editors, including Wilson, Higinbotham, Watts,
and Windsor, and inasmuch as eight only endured
from 1855 to 18(37, there must be some gingah in
F. W. The fat man again. We believe in the
fat man.
The writer of the London Times’ articles
on “The Colonies,” which appear each Monday
and are attracting considerable attention (among
those who are not acquainted with the “colonies ”)
for their apparent amplitude of internal know-
ledge, is, we are now told. Miss Shaw, a lady who
has never been out of England, except for a brief
visit to the Continent! On Australasian affairs
she is coached by the A gents-General and Royal
Colonial Institute.
Gerald Henry Staple is heard of again,
from Maoriland. He couldn’t see much when
he fired at G. P. Smith, and hit poor Sesnan
Walshe, and now he’s so batlike as to be dependent
on his sisters, wherefore the hat is going round,
for a worthy man, who once gave way to passion,
and was near a rope’s end, till Higinbotham
became his advocate, on a point sniffed at by
Fisher, of the Victor Emmanuel moustachios.
Sesnan Walshe, publican, was father of Walshe,
the operatic tenor.
When the great ’53 memorial (31,000
bona-fide signatures) from the miners of Bendigo,
the MTvor and Forest Creek districts, protesting
against the license-fee, was presented to Governor
La Trobe, the ex-Moravian missionary replied :
“ He was satisfied the diggers were mere grievance-
mongers, and he knew what was his duty, and
would do it at all risks. Hf 'the diggers troubled
the Government much more, lie would let them
hear how cannon could roar.” That old Victorian
identity, G. E. Thomson, who waspresent, says
that, after dismissing the deputationists, La Trobe
resumed his seat at his desk—and finished the
composition of a hymn.
George Mackay, in his “History of Ben-
digo,” says the local pottery produces Sevres china.
A ponderous Sydney weekly has, The
Bulletin notices, been ti, ng to make a virtue

it couldn’t. It has all along charged agents as
much as it could, and they won’t sell it under lid.

Watch. Your Nose!
Already the claim is made that one’s disposition
is outlined by his nose. According to the Buffalo
Commercial, large nostrils show courage. People
of fearless dispositions breathe fully and freely.
All the fiercer animals have dilated nostrils. The
drooping nostril shows histrionic talent. If the
nose also droops, it denotes a tragic power, and if
only the nostril the capacity is marked for the
interpretation of comedy. When the nose is thin
at the bridge it shows generosity, while a nose
that is thick at the bridge argues inquisitiveness.
When it is “ tip-tilted like the petal of a flower”
the person is inquisitive. A projecting nose
argues a disposition to investigate. It is ahead
of the person, as it were, and wants to scent out
things. Look at your nose in the glass and see
what sort of a person you are, anyway. If your
nose is blue you have a bad circulation, if very
pale you are suffering from poorness of blood, if
full of blackheads, which you can squeeze out,
your blood is impure, if your nose has a red color,
it may have cost you a lot of money to have got
up that beautiful brilliancy, and it may also cost
you a great deal still to keep it in repair; in
either case you are a victim of aggravated indiges-
tion caused by the liberties you take with your
stomach and liver, and must have immediate
recourse to that great regulator of all diseased
conditions, known .as Clements Tonic, which, so
far, has never failed to cure a single case which it
has been given a fair chance. Follow the example
of Cr. Alexander Tather, Esq., 198 Myers-street,
Geelong, Vic., who says : “It is a very pleasing
duty for me to convey to' you the facts of the
great benefit that has accrued to me through
taking Clements Tonic. For tiie last two years
1 have suffered very severely from indigestion,
flatulence, and I think every other horror
appertaining thereto, being subject to great
uneasiness and retching after meals, especially
after dinner, which meal I had to discontinue
altogether, the nasty sensation and retching
depressed me so much. I tried many of the
advertised cures without benefit, but on reading
of a case (cured by Clements Tonic) similar to my
own, I resolved to give the same remedy a trial,
and, after taking three bottles, the uneasy feeling
and retching were entirely cured ; and I shall not
fail to make it known as widely as possible in the
Geelong district, where I reside, and trust it may
be the means of relieving others so afflicted.”

R *The N.S.W. Labour Electoral League i s
now a purely Single-tax organisation.
Prodigious efforts will be made to oust
Trenwitli and Hancock from Richmond and
Collingwood. .. ~
Premier Griffith, of Queensland, told the
S A Register, that there must be another Con- .
vention before Federation. Yes, a differently-
constituted Convention.
The election-programme of the N.S.W.
“National ” Association will be single electorates,
one-man-one-vote, and an extra vote for thrift.
Memo, for comp. : Thrift, not Theft.
\ n Australian prelate warns his clergy
against dabbling in politics. This means that
Royalty is to be extravagantly lauded, but not a
whisper of Republicanism can be allowed.
The Echo (Sydney) doesn’t wave the
“bloody shirt” since The Bulletin thrust the
responsibility for its rabid sectarianism on the
shoulders of its owners, the S.M. Herald I air-
faxes.
Sir H. J. Wrixon said, at the Australian
Natives banquet, the other day, that there ought
to be no class distinctions —Why then take the
“handle ” which Francis, Lalor, and Higinbotham
despised ?
Dear Bulletin, —Minister Subtor walks
■ibout Sydney as if no death had occurred in the
Royal family. Premier Dibbs, the Republican,
wears the trappingsof grief—for his lately deceased
mother. —J.
Why not cut the N.S.W. Assembly down
from 141 to 60 men ? There are not more than 60
men in N.S.W. fit to be in Parliament. Getting
rid of 81 men at <£3oo a-year would effect a direct
saving of <£24,300.
The Australian Star tries to “ down ’’
Republican Rae, apparently in the interests of
Premier Dibbs, who also sits for the Murrum-
bidgee. The Bulletin opposes Rae’s fiscal views,
but”puts the Republic before all else.
Tom Bent is likely to get “ the knock ” at
the coming Victorian elections. Thomas can’t do
any more for Brighton, so that virtuous con-
stituency is developing broad views and a strong
regard for the interests of the country at large.
The sudden overthrow of the Parkes
Cabinet nipped in the bud a little intrigue by a
Sydney land-syndicate, to sell its offices for the
accommodation of the N.S.W. Forestry Depart-
ment. The price was to have been fixed at
£20,000.
The Governor of the Bank of England will
squirm when he reads Griffith’s latest callous
criticism of the great “god of England’s money-
bags’ : “ I don’t see in the least why we should be
in such tremendous awe of the bank. I don’t feel
in awe of the bank myself.”
The Imperial Federation League is relying
upon the seductive arts of lovely woman to win its
game. It appeals to the ladies—the titled ones !
of England to assist the “federation movement”
by extending hospitality to Australians and hold-
ing drawing-room meetings !
They have struck coal at Cremorne,
Sydney harbour, at a depth of 3018 feet. The
prospectors have the right to mine under Sydney
harbour, and under the sea. How much did they
pay for that right? How long is it to last? —and
how much does the State get out of it all ?
M‘Pliersun, who beat the Conservative
nominee in the hitherto reactionary stronghold of
Fast Adelaide, was a working printer in the local
Register office when the strike took place four
years ago. He lost his billet, was made Secretary
of the Trades and Labour Council, and got a post
in the Government Printing Office.
The National Association of N.S.W., like
the National Defence League of S.A., is really
directed by the local Employers’ Union. The
employers are pledged to sink the fiscal question
until the labor movement is crippled. For this
purpose the employers all round the Australias
are building up a big fighting fund.
W. J. Trickett (N.S.W.) is the author of
a bill to declare poor, but brainy politicians
ineligible for the position of President of the
Legislative Council. He proposes to strip the
o'ike of its sordid salary, and vest the Council
with the right to choose its President. Trickett
always drew his Ministerial screw !
G. S. Fowler, who unsuccessfully opposed
M'Pherson fur East Adelaide,* was boomed as the
“Independent” candidate, whilst his opponent
was described as a nominee of the Trades and
Labour Council. But was he not nominated
solely in the interests of the local “National
Defence League,” and did not Secretary Burgess
thereof act as his scrutineer ?
Mr. Price Williams, representing English
capitalists, has arrived in Adelaide to “mak®
arrangements for the construction of the trans-
continental railway line between Oodnadatta and
Pirie Creek on the land-grant system.” Which
simply means that what will eventually be the
main trunk line of Australia is sought to be par-
tially placed under the control of an English
syndicate.
Election dodges, like curses and chickens,
come home to roost. A certain suburban aider-
man who, in times gone by, worked the sectarian
and L.O.L. racket for all it was worth, now raises
a howl because someone unauthorised appends his
name to an advertisement whioh connects the
local Orange Lodge with his candidature for re-
election. There is no success in that game now ;
only a dead licking sure.'
The Dibbs Cabinet, like their predecessors,
decline to table the reports of the Civil Service
Commission because the evidence is not attached.
If Dibbs will address a note to the Government
Printer he will soon procure a copy of the evid-
ence, and learn if the reports are justified by that
evidence. By the way, was the evidence taken
down in longhand or shorthand ; and if in short-
hand, are the “ notes ” in existence?
Arthur Rae’s lone-hand vote in opposition
to the Royal vote of condolence, proposed in
N.S.W. Assembly, will result in his return for the
Murrumbidgee at next general election with a
bigger majority than ever. Here is a fair and
square prophecy made by The Bulletin, despite
the fact that every daily paper howls at Rae and
tells him to resign as he has degraded his con-
stituency and lost the public confidence. Imperial
“A ROSE,” &c.
LITTLE GIRL: “Mamma, is it wicked to say damn?”
MAMMA: “Yes, my dear, very shocking.”
LITTLE GIRL: “Well, mamma, can I say Rotterdam?”
MAMMA: “Oh, yes, my dear, you can say Rotterdam.”
LITTLE GIRL: “Well, Elsie has eaten all my lollies, and I hope they’ll Rotterdam
teeth!”
Eederationists are requested to paste this in their
hats.
We have made a collection of 53 speeches-
in which “ the Labour movement ” is held respon-
sible for either “driving away capital,” or “re-
tarding the investment of capital in the develop-
ment of the country’s internal resources.” Over
forty were delivered by well-known land-boomers
and “wild-cat” company-promoters —the men
who thrive on immoral speculation in “values”
created by the ignorance, the supineness, and the
credulity of the workers.
How Toryism must writhe under the ter-
rible blows which the London Times, from a sense
of impending danger to the nation, is reluctantly
compelled to deal its most characteristic features
—the class control of the army and navy ! The
agony of tire poet’s eagle at witnessing one of its
own feathers upon the fatal dart which has
brought it to the ground, must be bliss itself
compared to the Tory pangs. That Age-spirit -
what pranks it does make the blind fool play !
Mr. Canning, member for West Perth,
lately asked the W. A. Legislative Assembly to
abolish the members’ qualification (freehold
property to the value of <£soo, or £5O annual
value, free from incumbrance). The question was
unanimously hung up for 12 months. Mr.
Canning’s liberality is attributable to his having
been “ raised ”in the East. He was the first
manager of the Bank of N.S.W. at Perth, and
since leaving the Wales has successfully managed
a big financial concern.
British diplomacy in petticoats ! The naval
tribute of £37,000 a year New South Wales swal-
lowed under compulsion ; but an annual tribute of
£6700 to the coffers of the Imperial Institute
Parkes resolutely refused to propose, even “ by
command ”of Tummy. A ll the other provinces but
New South Wales are understood to have been
nobbled by the Imperial Eederationists. It is
now announced that the Dibbs Ministry have been
persuaded to ask for the additional tribute. And
rumour credits a certain distinguished lady
visitor with working the oracle. The female
globe-trotter is a more insidious enemy than a
score of Brasseys, Parkins, and Somers Vines,
Sydney Echo opines that 26th January
will, when all the provinces are federated, become
“ the great Australian holiday,” and that it will
entirely supersede the various foundation and
separation days observed by Queensland, South
Australia, Victoria, &e. As a matter of fact, the
26th January is an inky blot on the calendar of
the mother-colony, which no number of annual
regattas can wash out. The great Australian
holiday of the future will be Federation Day—the
day when the paltry distinctions and the degrad-
ing memories associated with the petty provincial
divisions of the past will be swept into the same
grave of oblivion as the memory of Australia’s
first gaolers.
Is the Sydney Daily Telegraph a Single-
tax paper? And if it isn’t, then what is it?
About four times a week it publishes an article
in which it sools the Single-taxers on in their
wild career, and grovels before them, and tells
what noble characters they are —and yet it never
once dares to say straight out that it wants the
Single-tax. It fills innumerable columns with the
dull maunderings of the smallest of Single-tax
drivellers, and alludes in pathetic terms to the
“convincing eloquence” of every di'y-as-dust
Henry-Georgeite, but it never states explicitly
that it believes that eloquence. This sort of thing
is getting monotonous. If the D.T. hasn’t the
courage to be a Single-tax paper, and yet hasn’t
the courage not to be a Single-tax paper, then it is
a darned poor paper anyhow, and has no more
backbone than a mass of soup.
Instead of wrangling over petty points of
“ discipline-breaking’’—which, as often as not,
are mere protests against “ bounc-
ing” upon the part of some Union official —the
Typographical Societies of Australia would be
better employed in fighting the importers of the
cheap, penny, alleged newspaper rubbish with
which the Australian cities are inundated. In
the first place, this spawn of the press is made
up of stolen and pirated, or else “sweated”
matter, which no Australian literary man or
printer who strives to pay his way can compete
with ; and, in the second place, the inrushing of
this stuff thrusts beyond all chance of existence
any cheap, purely literary Australian journal,
and thus injures the local labour market. Even
Pilfer, Publish and Co., the “supplement pro-
prietor,” pay “ colonial ” wages—to boys.
In Maoriland, at the present moment,
there are 1536 laws in force, and each citizen is
supposed to know and obey all of them, fail-
ing which, there are 1536 different ways of
getting run in. The biggest record for one
year in the way of new legislation, was that of
1877, when the Parliament rushed through 142
Bills in one session, and in five other sessions over
a hundred Bills were passed successfully. Against
these, however, there were some years that were
woefully barren. In the first session of 181)1
nothing was passed at all; in the first of 1884 only
one Act got through ; in the first of 1870 the
total was four ; and in the two years, 1854-55,
only 17 new laws were enacted altogether. On
the other hand, the Maoriland Parliament has
done some healthy work at repealing old, used-up
enactments. In 1878 it abolished 363 laws in one
fell jump; in 1891 it wiped out 285; in 1882 it
extinguished 118; and in 1877 it got rid of 101.
Still the total keeps moving steadily upwards.
In 1841 Maoriland had only six laws altogether.
In 1851 it had 108. By 1861 the total had gone
up to 298. Then it took a start, and ten years
later there were 847. There were 1197 in 1877,
and then the House started to repeal them so fast
that it took nine years to get the number of
statutes up to this figure again. But, as a rule,
the country likes statutes, and the cry is still
“ give us more law.” The Ballance Government
hasn’t done much in this way yet, and unless it
wakes up and passes 250 Acts very soon, it will
find trouble looming ahead.
Dr. Hillas, of Wagga (formerly of Mel-
bourne), is dead. He had practised medicine for
40 years.
The recent Chilian imbroglio will push
forward the scheme of Secretary Blaine and Naval
Secretary Tracy to spend 50 millions on a XJ.S.
Navy, to equal England’s.
Oscar Wilde’s brother, Willie, when last
seen by a Melbourne man, was collecting the
names on the wreaths at Wilkie Collins’ funeral
for London Telegraph. Willie describes himself
to strangers as the best descriptive writer on the
D.T. —which is announcing a moiety.
Well-known officers to be superannuated
from the Victorian police this year; Chomley
(Chief), Ryall, Palmer, Drought, Toohey, Mont-
fort, Kennedy, Rennie, Ellis, Webb, Daly, Beck-
with. Total : Superintendents, 6; inspectors, 7 ;
sergeants, 19 ; senior-constables, 9 ; constables, 10.
The Cabinet definitely decided on this step last
week. The private reason was the likelihood of
political disturbances. Ministers thought the
force was too much on the conservative side, in
regard to the Tom-Price-Lay-’em-out crisis of 1890,
in the strike.
The Bulletin notices that one of the
N.S.W. Judges has been allowing a Crown Prose-
cutor to cross-examine a prisoner (who, under the
new evidence law, tendered his testimony on his
own behalf) as to whether he was not related to a
certain notorious criminal—the bushranger Ben.
Hall. Such cross-examination is worthy, not of a
Judge or a Crown Prosecutor, but only of a police-
man, and should not be allowed even where a
prisoner has tendered evidence as to good charac-
ter, for no man is responsible for the deeds of his
relatives. We have known a most excellent
horse-thief to be the uncle of a most excellent and
upright Judge, just as we have known a most
excellent divorce-Judge to be the uncle of a young
man who was twice successfully made a co-res-
pondent.
The “labour agency 1 ' man doesn’t get
whacked near so often as he ought to do, but one
of the tribe has come to grief in Melbourne. A
red-headed man named O’Donoghue applied to
him for work, and he gravely appointed that
person to a certain situation, and charged him ten
shillings. O’Donoghue went to the job, and
found that it had been filled up. Then
he asked the labour man for his ten shil-
lings. Anybody with sense would have known
that it was safer to stir up a tiger with a
hot poker than to chaff a red-headed man with a
grievance and a name like O’Donoghue, but the
agency person had no sense. He guyed his client,
and ten minutes later the police had to haul
O’Donoghue off the top of a mashed agent, and
the excited Irish person was run in, spitting out
his enemy’s ears and hair and clothes as he went.
Then the two parties proceeded against each other,
but the court dismissed both cases on the ground
that things were about level. A little incident
like this is a pleasant oasis in the great desert of
existence, and we hope to hear that some more
“ labour bureau ” gentlemen have run up against
the O’Donoghue.
Some years ago, when Gisborne (M.L.)
was known as Turanganui, and when the wily
Pakeha had settled but sparsely amongst the
ingenuous Maoris of Poverty Bay, lived an old
whaling captain named Reid, who carried on a
roaring business in red shawls, coloured petticoats,
blankets, and fish-hooks with the natives of that
district. The equivalent value of a fish-hook was,
perhaps, a few hundred acres of land or so—Reid
made his own terms. No banks were established
at Turanganui in those days, and the captain
issued of his own, payable on demand.
One native, who had fallen out with the store-
keeper, chanced to possess about A3OO of this
paper. Knowing that the notes were Reid’s, and
hoping to inconvenience the captain by so doing, the
Maori carefully gathered the securities together,
placed them in his “whare,” and burnt the whole
lot. Fearing lest Reid should become cognisant of
his action, and take criminal proceedings against
him, the innocent savage made a clean breast of his
action to the captain, and offered any reparation
in his power. At first the captain refused to com-
promise and threatened the Maori with gaol, but
eventually he relaxed, and agreed to take 30,000
acres of the best land in the district, and let the
matter drop. Little wonder that, when Reid died,
the stamp duty in probate on his estate amounted to
,£3OOO or so. Since this took place civilization has
blotted out all the ingenuousness of the native race.

LIFE OF C. S. PARNELL,

Price (post jreo), Is. 2d.
“ Mr. O’Connor has certainly surpassed himself in the
writing of this intensely interesting work. ... No
newspaper notice, however full, can give any adequate
impression of the career as is here depicted of the great
Irishman who has gone. Mr. O’Connor’s hook itself should
he in the hands of everyone who is interested in the
brilliant and stormy career which is ended forever. . .

the most remarkable figures of the century.”—Dublin

Two absolute essentials for the existence
of the human race are —land and air. Many
economic and political systems have been invented
and are advocated for obtaining land for each
individual to live upon, but it has been left to the
Hydraulic Cooling and Ventilating Co. to intro-
duce pure air into every habitation in Australia,
by means of their “Perfection” Cooler and
Ventilator. By attaching this machine to your
water supply or tank, and simply turning on the
tap, a constant stream of pure, fresh air can be
obtained in any chamber you desire. Punkahs
are thus superseded, perishable goods can be kept
at a small expense without ice, and you can enjoy
the luxury of a cool chamber on the hottest day oi
night. The machine, which is simplicity itself,
works at the cost of one half-penny per day, while
the price brings it within the reach of most.
Send for particulars or inspect the machines work
ing in our offices. T. A. Knight and Co., St.
James Chambers, King-street. Sydney.
Sociery
A great effort is about to be made in
Sydney to establish an Institute of Journalists on
the same plans and specifications as those already
existing in England and Victoria. Owing to the
solemn apathy of the local paper-stainers one or
two Melbourne men are taking the initiative, and
they seem sanguine of success. Possibly they
don’t know the full awfulness of the Sydney news-
paper man. Some years ago an effort was made in
the same direction, but it collapsed with a hollow
note like a bladder falling into a tomb. A banquet
was held, it being considered that the slave of
the ink-pot might be more valiant when full of
victuals; and after the food an energetic jour-
nalist got up to explain the purposes of the move-
ment. He Began by stating that it was eminently
desirable to form an association of literary
workers of all grades in order to conserve their
interests as against those of the proprie . He
was interrupted there by a horrible sound of feet,
and never even finished the word. The noise
arose through the S.M. Herald men galloping
unanimously for the door. They felt that the cold,
searching eye of “ Mister James ” was upon them,
and at the first hint of possible opposition to that
all-seeing potentate they fled into the street and
ran right back to the office.

Sydney Evening News and Sydney Daily
lelegraph are just now having a lively compe-

Melbourne pressmen are howling against
George Coppin, not so much for cutting down his
free list as for advertising the fact that it was only
intended for those “on duty.” Deuced awkward
for a number of dashing young journalists (and
canvassers) who used to assume a protectorate over
the drama and religiously take their lady friends
in with them to see whether the show was going
on all right. “Take me to the pantomine next
time you are writing one of your notices,” says the
sweet young lady deadhead to a football reporter
or a special correspondent on potato crops. And
when he tells the maiden that they haven’t got
him on the list she looks astounded and asks
“ Aren't you on duty? Then how do the notices get
in the paper if you are not there?” Which causes
the burst-up critic to curse Coppin more loudly
than ever. The edict was especially rough on
sundry newspaper canvassers, who love to loom
large on the first nights and obtrusively take quiet
notes of the performance in huge pocket-books.
Besides, how can they go “behind,” and con-
gratulate the new star, now that they are off duty?

On one occasion that venerable just-
deceased bridegroom, ex-Judge Josephsoii, of
N.S.W., was defendant in a District Court case
tried before Judge Dowling. After giving evidence
Josephson went up on the Bench and took a seat
beside Dowling, who, after a good look at Joseph-
son through his “specs.,” said, pointing to the/
body of the Court : “Your place at present, sir, is
down there.” Josephson immediately took the
hint and left his seat. The genial Dowling then
delivered judgment for the plaintiff, and gave
costs on the higher scale against Josephson.

Lady Hay (N.S.W.), who followed her
husband to the grave within a fortnight, took her
farewell of him a few hours before his death,
when the impossibility of his recovery was com-
municated to her. He was then lying uncon-
scious. She bent down and kissed him, murmured,
I cannot bear to see him die !” and, unaided,
walked into an adjoining room, where, an hour
afterwards, she was seized with paralysis. So
ended a wedded union of fifty-three years’ dura-
tion. Lady Hay was one of the wives who make
their husband’s careers.

Godly embezzlers must not conclude that,
if they follow the example of a late official of the
Sydney City Council and confess to peculations
under the influence of “ a religious awakening ”
they are going to be let off as lightly. The young
fellow in question was fortunate in having wealthy
friends to plank down the amount of his defalca-
tions, and it is unlikely that any quantity of con-
fession, if unbacked by the restitution of solid
cash, would have touched the hearts of the city
fathers to the degree of forgiving the sinner. But,
anyhow, it doesn’t lie within the function of a
municipal council to condone an offence against
the criminal law. The case should have been
allowed to go to Court, and, under the circum-
stances, there is no doubt (the facts being as
alleged) a nominal sentence only, with immediate
release “on licence,” would have been inflicted.

Sir M. H. Davies, Speaker of the Vic-

the persistent rumours that he has compounded
with his creditors. The Bulletin is glad to hear
this for, though it has not hesitated to ridicule the
vulgar display of his wealth often perpetrated by
this prince of the suddenly-enriched when the
shekels were coming in freely, it has always felt
that Sir M. was a cut above others of his class.
In his days of prosperity he stuck loyally to every
man who had helped him up the ladder, and did
not trap the people whose brains he bought into
false and illegal positions.

The second prize in the A.N.A. art-union,
drawn at Melbourne Exhibition on the awful day
we celebrate, was Arthur Loureiro’s picture of a
wooden dawg with its forepaw on the chest of a
wooden boy, who lies prostrate on a smudgy waste
of white paint, probably intended to represent a
rug. This appalling work, which covers a con-
siderable area of canvas, was the art-equivalent
for a hundred golden sovereigns. It figured of
yore in the Victorian Loan Collection at the
Centennial Exhibition, so a question naturally
arises as to whether the Festival Committee
bought their prize direct from the artist, or from
somebody who gave him an order for it. In which
latter case one would furthermore wish to know
the name and A.N.A. connections of the party
who was thus able to sell off a family picture at
such a satisfactory price.

Emperor.” In other words, the descendant of a
long line of epileptics, brother of a Prince who
died from epilepsy, is to marry a cousin of his own,
daughter of a man who died of a mysterious
disease and sister of a man with a sore ear and a

Parliamentary Officer Logan (N.S.W.) has

His retirement from the parliamentary service has
paved the way for the further promotion of the
son of the Clerk of the Assembly. Although
nepotism was not a factor in the punishment of
Mr. Logan, yet his enforced removal from his
old position created a vacancy by which Clerk
Webb’s son must benefit.

strange hags, on which were displayed red dragons
and silver cockroaches, while the ravishing music
of the sweet shamsheen broke in upon the ear from
every alley-way where live Chinamen were con-

exploded, opium was smoked ad lib., and “ hi-yahs”
were extremely numerous. Altogether the

mixed with much opium and fan-tan, and many
banquets, with fat rats on the half-shell.

A RHYME OF RESTLESSNESS.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Some strange, strong surgings in my heart are urging mi
to sing,
A song whose words I cannot grasp as in my brain the'
ring—
A paean of enrapturement, or a deep, wild sorrowing.
It cannot be a lay of love to trill in triplets sweet,
Since love but lingered near me, leaving me at length U
meet
Alone, the anguish of a life forever incomplete.
Nor dare 1 smite the chord that stirs the voice of Hopi
again,
The voice that erstwhile thrilled mo and spurred me to
attain
Some phantom goal, and mocked me when I had toiled in
vain.
And I to sing of Faith, who failed a friend in dire distress!
Who scoffed at protestations poured from lips 1 used to
press,
And harboured in my heart the doubts I flinch now to
confess !
Tis not a song of joy my heart interpretation craves,
But a steadfast soul in bitter strife with the weakness
that depraves,
And turns ray thoughts in envy to the dead in peaceful
graves.
When wintry gales blow wildly through the valley where
I dwell,
And the mighty peals of thunder join their discordance
fell,
I hear the same mad music in the windstorm surge and
swell.
The same deep lamentation, (he same despairing sighs,
The straining for deliv.’rance from overwhelming ties,
The passionate rebellion that ’gainst repression cries.
But the burdened clouds wind-driven in torrents find
release ;
The storm will pass away again and its angry clamours
cease, *
The morrow’s sunrise shining o’er a radiant scene of peace.
While I must struggle blindly through a life I learn to
hate
Since the sorrows come so swiftly and the promised joys
so late,
And failure aye pursues me like some avenging fate.
The chill of disappointment, oft-recurring, o’er me
sweeps,
The gloom of disillusion o’er my bright ambition creeps,
And for the shattered youthful dreams aspiring fanev
weeps.
With introspection’s bitterness, my hapless heart i s
wrung ;
I learn so late how frail have been the hopes to which I’ve
clung,
And till my way is clearer grown, my song must stay
unsung.

recovery was deemed to be impossible. Mrs.
Thomas (who wrote as “ Lyth ”) was governess in
several “tip-top” families, and many society
dames of to-day were first put through Ollendorf
by the little lady, the expenses of whose trip to
England for medical advice are, it is no secret,
being borne by one of her erstwhile pupils, whose
great fortune is derived from beer, rents, and wool
in about equal proportions.

More of the humours of the influenza.
In one of the Maoriland cities a rash youth and
his girl were going to be married on the 7th of
last month, but the male partner in the crime took
the disease, and the ceremony was postponed till
the 12th. He was better by the 12th, but on the
11th the best man collapsed, and out of respect
for him the wedding was put off till the 14th. In
the interval the bride’s mother broke down, which
led to an adjournment till the 20th, and then the
bride caught the distemper and the date had to
be shifted to the 23rd. On the morning of the
22nd one of the bridesmaids lay up and the other
collapsed that same evening, but by this time the
two lovers were desperate, and they decided that
the marriage should come off regardless of any-
body. But early in the morning of the wedding-
day the parson took the disease badly, and went
to bed, and the bridegroom’s father got it also.
Then the two went off to the Registrar, with no
bridesmaids or best man or anything, and that
public official having escaped the malady up to
date he put them through. They went off to Mel-
bourne for their honeymoon, and the bride had a
relapse on the steamer, and the captain had the
influenza, also two of the deck-hands, and the
stewardess, and it was an enjoyable trip all
round.

Talk about powerful situations in fiction
or the drama ! Just think of that fratricide in
Victoria last week! The murderer, having already
fired one charge into his brother, assists a labourer
to help his victim to his bed in another room, then
locks the door after the labourer, who runs for the
police; then, evidently from the doorway, fires
the shot which kills his brother; finally suicides !
That shot from the doorway—wounded man
writhing in agony, but pleading for life, watches
the fellow, raised at the same breast, re-load the
gun —take aim. Ugh ! The finest situation-con-
structor on the stage is but a fool, after all, com-
pared with Mother Nature.

A Trinidad (West Indian) paper publishes
a bitter complaint about the goings-on of a local
Judge. The Judge lives at a hotel and has a
horrible drunk every night; and whenever the
hunky youths of the locality want some amuse-
ment they paint his face black, fresco his hair,
or else rig him up in female attire, and start him
on a run down the street. On one occasion, being
a little drunker than usual, he appeared at his
window stark naked, and having whooped till he
raised a crowd he solemnly delivered a judgment
in Equity and then trotted off to bed. A lady
living next door tried to have him arrested because
almost every night he used to stand on the balcony
and blaspheme at large, and his curses floated
through her bedroom window and prevented her
sleeping. Also sundry plaintiffs and defendants
are raising a row, because they hired expensive
lawyers to lay their case before his Honor, and
then; instead of delivering judgment, his Honor
simply fell off the bench on to the floor and snored
heavily. Therefore they reckon that the whole
affair was money wasted, and they object to the
Judge, and want him removed, either by the
Crown or the man who keeps the ash-cart.

Melbourne Evening Herald gives some
of its history. It is the oldest Melbourne paper
alive and once ran the race with the Argus as a

Michie and Dr. Evans. The three Melbourne morn-

until the Herald first lowered to a penny, but
G. C. Levey could not galvanise it, wherefore it
turned to an evening paper, as one of the Symese
Twins. Winter hoisted it, with 20 years’ work.
Strange that Melbourne has no more morning
papers than when it was half the size.

known as the Die-hards) in the Maori War, but
first having been disrated from the rank of a non-
commissioned officer to a private, and then having
his grog stopped for misconduct, he deserted with
a large amount of ammunition and some firearms,
and joined the Maoris. He was a determined
man, and, as events proved, an excellent General,
and he led a large force of Maoris upon his late
comrades, and displayed great coolness as a leader.
In the engagement that ensued, he shot down
Colonel Hazzard. The 57th, however, drove back
the Maoris, but failed to secure Kemball Bent.
It is rumoured that Bent is still living among the
natives, but he has not been visible for years, as he
is no doubt afraid to be seen in any town in
Maoriland. Colonel Hazzard’,s grave lies some
miles out of Wanganui, and was altogether
neglected until lately.
Dear Bulletin, —Like Bret Harte’s All
Sin, I had “the cards up my sleeve.” Because I
was “found out,” society pronounces me a
sinner, and suits the action to the word by giving
me the proverbial kick-because-he-is-down. True,
I have sinned, but before God and man I have
expiated my offence very dearly, yet those suc-
cessful and immaculate Christians who never,
never sin, keep on pelting me. A starving wretcli
asks for work, therefore starve him, for he happens
to have expiated his sin before human eyes. Such
is my case—years in gaol for a first offence, months
out of gaol, capable and willing to work, eagerly
seeking it every day, blackmailed by Christian
tongues when the coveted morsel is about to drop
into my mouth. Worse still, I have responsi-
bilities, young as well as old, all innocent victims
of my sin. They starved while I luxuriated on
hominy and graduated in crime. Now that I
have satisfied human law, we all starve together.
Such is true charity and boasted philanthropy of
to-day, with the DischargedPrisoners’ Aid Society
and the Queen’s Jubilee Fund thrown in.—Yours,

This is the plain, unvarnished story of a
S.A. railway official. He was station-master at a
large suburban station, in a district much infested
by eminent politicians. Most of them used to
have parcels sent up periodically, and the
blubbery menial used to call for them and carry
them away. He never, by any chance, had a
cent about him to pay freight, and he always
simply marched off with the package under his
arm, and said, “Mr. will pay the next time
he is passing.” Mr. never did pay; there
were about six of him and not one of them ever
seemed to remember that he owed anything. r J he
station-master was supposed to work on a strictly
cash basis, but if he demanded the money from
any of these potentates lie knew that they would
report Imn for “ insolence,” and so he let
them slide. Then the inspector came round
and raised trouble about the unpaid freights,
and the auditor wrote a letter to the
miserable official, and told him that he was to do
his duty without respect of persons, and threatened
to have him suspended. He grew desperate at
this stage of the story, and sent in a bill to each
of his distinguished debtors. Not one of them
paid, but four of them warned him that
they would report him if he repeated the uncalled-
for performance. Then, when the next batch of
parcels came along, the station-master shut down
on the flunkeys, and told each of them that the
freight must be paid on delivery. Next day the
owners of the plush-covered creatures reported
him for “gross impertinence.” The day after, he
was reduced to be master of a small country
station out in the desert, partly for not collecting
freights and chiefly for trying to collect them.
This is a hard world for any man who collides
with a big politician’s flunkey.

Clink of hobble and brazen bell ;
Mark the passage of stalwart shearer,
Bidding Monaro soil farewell.
Where is he making for? Down the River,
Down the River with eager tread ;
Where is he making for? Down the River,
Down the River to seek a.“shed.”
Where is his dwelling on old Monaro?
Buckley’s Crossing, or Jindaboine ?
Dry Plain is it, or sweet Bolaira ?
P’raps ’tis near where the rivers join, i
Where is he making for? Down the River,
When, oh when, will he turn him back ?
Soft sighs follow him down the River,
Moist eyes gaze at his fading track.
See, behind him his pack-horse, ambling,
Bears the weight of his master’s kit,
Oft and oft from the pathway rambling,
Crops unhampered by cruel bit.
Where is he making for? Equine rover,
Sturdy nag from the Eucumbene,
Tempted down by the thought of clover,
Springing luscious in Riverine.
Dreams of life and its future chances, .
Snatch of song to beguile the way ;
Through green crannies the sunlight glances,
Silver-gilding the bright “ Jack Shay.”
“So long, mate, I can stay no longer,
So long, mate, I’ve no time to stop ;
Pens are waiting me at : Mahonga,’
‘ Bluegong,’Grubben, and Pullitop.
“ What! you say that the River’s risen ?
What! that the melted snow has come ?
What! that it locks and bars our prison ?
Many’s the mountain stream I ve swum.
I must onward and cross the River,
So long, mate, for I cannot stay ;
I must onward and cross the River,
Over the River there lies my way.”
One man short when the roll they're calling,
One man short at old “ Bobby Rand's ” ;
Heads are drooping and tears are faking
Up on Monaro’s mountain lands.
Where is he making for? Down the River,
Down the river of slimy bed ;
Where is he making for? Down the River,
Down the River that bears him, dead.

There are 80,000 barmaids in England
whose hours average 14 daily, for a wage of 10s.
per week.
A I‘2o-head battery is being erected at
Langlaate mine, South Africa. This mine, like
the Robinson, is expected to return 10,000cz. a
month from 14,000 tons of quartz. The cost of
crushing will not exceed 3s. (id. per ton.
The Kiama (N.S. W.) bakers have, under
the new tariff, raised bread from 3d. to 4d. per
21b. loaf. Now, the flour-duty is only A 1 per
20001 b. This increase of a penny per loaf thus
gives the grasping bakers =£s 16s. Bd. more profit
on each ton of flour. Competition should remedy
this.
The new illustrated furniture catalogue
issued by Messrs. John Lawler and Sons, of 608
George-street, Sydney, is, without doubt, one of
the finest and most complete volumes cf its kind
ever published in Australia. It is a publication
of nearly 90 pages and contains close on 400
illustrations showing all varieties of goods dealt in
by the firm. Even this, however, is only a
supplement to a larger and more imposing
book with 750 illustrations, which supplies quo-
tations for every article beneath the sun that can,
by any possibility, be classed under the head of
furniture. Mr. Lawler has just returned from a
tour round the world, in the course of which he
has made immense purchases of all kinds of
novelties, and in addition to the large importations
made by the firm it possesses extensive factories—
recently enlarged and furnished with much
additional plant—from which all descriptions of
goods are turned out. Lawler and Sons’ ware-
house is one of these huge structures which have
arisen so plentifully of recent years—a towering
edifice which is a Sabbath-day’s journey from
basement to roof and a long and exhausting tramp
from one end to the.other. The stock within is the
largest and probably also the cheapest of its kind
in New South Wales. The vast building is
choke-full of novelties in carpets, furniture,
bedding, floorcloths, linoleums, ornaments, iron-
mongf ry, crockery-ware, and other things without
number. The one fixed object of the proprietors
is evidently to break all records in their own
department of business, and they have attained
so very near to their purpose that the rest doesn’t
matter.
For removing dandruff, Ayer’s Hair Vigor has
no equal. It restores faded and gray hair to its
original color, stimulates the growth of the hair,
and gives it a beautiful, glossy, and silken appear-
ance.

Home News says Parkes keeps the six-
pence he first earned in Sydney, for holding a
horse. So very like him. Beautiful legend, hand
it down to posterity. Charles Surface, the ex-
travagant, wouldn’t part with his uncle’s portrait.
Toby Barton was reminded by Parkes the
other night, in N.S.W. Assembly, that he was
educated at Sydney University partly “at my
expense. ” What Parkes ought, to have said was—
Partly at the expense of my numerous creditors.”
“ Prior to the advent of the Maoriland
blackleg shearers on the Darling, (N.S.W.) fleas
and Scotch greys were unknown on that river.
Now the huts on several stations swarm with
these vermin. There can be no doubt as to their
being of Maori origin, for as they move about over
the floors, tables and bunks, they can be seen
rubbing noses together,” remarks a shearer cor-
respondent.
There was only one woman on the
Murchison (W. A.) goldfield and she suicided the
other day, and now there is no woman at all. We
wonder what her name was. You bet she was
either, “The Speckled Hen,” or “The Murrum-
bidgee Barge,” or “The Bull Pup,” or “The
Bong-handled Shovel,” or “Square Sarah,” or
“Gentle Annie,” or “Mother Coppernose,” or
“ Portwine Lizzie or something like that. The
only woman on a goldfield is nearly always one of
these things.
Passage from Miss Braddon’s latest novel,
One Life One Love,” page 243, in which a
highly-educated girl is writing in her diary about
her brother :—
i5y this time lie has fallen in love with some Australian
gnl, a powerfully-built creature who can ride buck-
jumpers and camp out in the bush without fear of the
consequences. I fear I have very narrow and insular
ideas about Australia which I can only picture to myself
as one vast jungle tempered with Convict Settlements.
And yet they know all about us in Bull Land.
NERVOUS DEBILITY.
There are at the present time many remedies in
the market for this terrible complaint, but they
are not always what they are claimed to be by
their proprietors. It is, however, pleasant to
find that some of them are really genuine. The
very best of them is Herr Rassmussen’s (the
celebrated Danish herbalist) Denmark Vitality
Fills, which have cured a world of nervous
suffering, and which are all what they are claimed
to be—a genuine cure for nervous debility, des-
pondency, errors and vital weakness. They are
sold at as. Gd. and 22s. Gd. per box, posted 6s. and
2«D. Gd., and forwarded to any part of the world.
They are highly recommended to nervous
sufferers, as well as Herr Rassmussen’s Den-
mark Lock Cure Pills, which are a genuine cure
for all diseases of the blood, sores and discharges.
A fine constitution may be ruined by simple
neglect. Many bodily ills result from habitual
constipation. There is no medicine equal to
Ayer’s Pills for restoring the system to natural
and healthy action.

The Sydney News Syndicate (of 29 Eliza-
beth-street, Sydney), is a new departure in Aus-
tralian journalism. It is an organisation of
some of the cleverest pressmen of the city formed
for the purpose of supplying weekly or daily
letters to the country press, the said letters con-
taining all the noteworthy information of the day,
written up in the most interesting fashion. For
the benefit of the impecunious editor who
wrestles with the gigantic turnip in the
bush, the syndicate will supply from one to two
columns of good reading matter for 5s., and will
thus furnish the scribe of the wilderness with all
the benefits and the dignity of an expensive
Sydney representative at less than half ordinary
Chinese rates. Mr. Frank Barnes is the local
manager of the syndicate, and any country press-
man who wants to lend an air of distinction to his
columns would do well to communicate with him
forth wi th. —A DVT.

SPORTING NOTIONS-
How is the backer of turf “form” to keep a
roof over his miserable head? At Caulfield (Melb.) the
Ballarat horse, Annesley, won the Anniversary Handicap
of 1 mile 3 furlongs like a streak of lightning. After
l,eing last of the field for a mile the horse came forward
at the critical moment and cantered home in front of
Propounder and Tantallon. Three days later the three
horses ran over exactly the same distance at Wilhams-
fo\vn, and Annesley, who was meeting the others on only
six pounds worse terms than before, managed to finish
two or three lengths behind Propounder. The charitable
presumption is that the handsome Neckersgat colt is a

“ went off ” prior to last year’s V.R.O. Derby.

Tattersall’s Cup sweeps were well advertised in
the Walhalla (Vic.) district in ’9O. Two men went
“halves” in a 50,000 at 10 consultation, and drew
Carbine. A dispute arose over the matter, and the busi-
ness was settled in court, much to the joy of the lawyer.
Among the witnesses was a Scotchman, Jamie M‘N— —,
well-known in the district. Jamie had had a toothful or
two, but was very canny in the witness-box. “ Are you
drunk, sir?” bawled the infuriated cross-examining barris-
ter. “Na,na,” said Jamie, “I’m no drunk,’ addingthathe
knew of only one man who ever teas drunk in his life.
“Who was that?” queried the lawyer. “ Jonah, and that
was when the whale drunk him.”

At the Victorian Amateur Turf Club meeting
last week a balancer turned up. This is a cash-fielder
who passes an Insolvent Act for his own ben., and tries to
compound with a dividend, but the club wouldn’t have it,
and made him give a bill of sale over his furniture, to
pay all hands. "Then is Doomsday near. We are going
up a mountain to wait for Gabriel, with the Peculiar

After Sydney Tattersall’s Cup, the local D.T.
(the demon comp., of course, did it) told its readers that
at a certain part of the race “Paris/affeuedhis backers.’
The Bulletin may be excused if it remarks that Pans aid
that same again once more on Tuesday. Flattened ’em
clean out, in fact, in the Anniversary Handicap ! Many
a true word, &c. Of course Bob Mostyn wrote “flattered.’
The corap. spoilt it, but he got there just the same.

A prize story of the prize-ring. Two prominent
Sydney pugs, did Queensland together. They met per
arrangement in a Far Northern town and worked up a
terrible contest in the local paper. The foes agreed, sub-
rosa, that A., the better man, should go down. Accord-
ingly B. laid every cent he had on himself. In the battle
A. slaughtered B. and cleared with the big win. _ A. now
boasts of the “double cross” he worked on his whilom
partner, who at present is penniless in a strange town.

Some of Lord Sheffield’s “ amateur ” cricketers
were quite carried away by their feelings at Melbourne
tug-of-war tournament. While Norway was pulling
England all over the place, they sat silent and terribly
solemn, but w-hen Scotland, on the brink of defeat, lugged
Sweden all the way back to pistol-shot, their joy was
electric and conspicuous. When Ireland eloped with
America, they grew hysterical, and lurched about sym-
pathetically with every movement of the teams.
# * *
Lately two Sydney professional athletes visited
a marine suburb in a state of “ tonic.” When in the baths
one essayed the foolhardy teat of swimming out beyond
the rollers which broke into surf on the rocks. He
plunged boldly enough into the grave awaiting him and
next instant became powerless in the breakers, and was
battered to insensibility- By a mere chance three or four
bathers were enabled to rescue him. He was badly
lacerated and bruised and remained unconscious for som e
time. Moral, never wade beyond your ankles in whisky.

The Sydney Association Ground Committee-
rooms have been up till very lately a perfect hotbed of
genteel loaferdom. However, since the trustees have
taken the pavilion bar into their hands and work it as a
club they have dropped the gratuitous “nip” in the
committee-rooms, free grog has been curtailed, and con-
sequently the crowd has fallen off woefully. The irrepres-
sibles have now transferred their operations to the
pavilion, and at lunch-time the fun commences, when the
great array of well-dressed cadgers can be seen button-
holing the officials for free-lunch tickets.
# * *
It is the ambition of most N.S.W. cricketers to
“break the clock,” and the Australian who went nearest
to the feat was the old-timer, Monty Faithful!, who on
three occasions went perilously close to putting the ball
through the face of the old Albert Ground (Sydney) clock.
We give this for the edification of people who may not
have quite understood the wag who facetiously advised
Alec. Bannerman in the recent big match “ not to break
the clock.”
# * *
The Y.R.O.’s latest move is an adroit one.
While swooping down on unregistered meetings, it opens
its arms to pony-owners willing to return to the fold.
Two remunerative pony-races will in future be given at
each meeting by the registered clubs. This invitation
will no doubt be gladly accepted by owners of all ponies
worth seeing. There will now be little attraction on the
small suburban courses ; trotting is now loathsome in the
eves of the Southern world.

The bona fide cab-horse Shadow won the cab-
horse trot, at Lillie Bridge (Sydney), on Saturday night,
in 3min. 42sec. Not bad value for one “ Bishop Smith,”
the use of Shadow, trap, and driver, for fifteen minutes.

A sarcastic and irreverent person remarked, as
Bob-cab Smith came on to Sydney Association Ground on
Monday that Saumarez had probably come “ to field for
Moses.”

Moses is the Carbine of the cricket-field. He
has a recurring leg.

Australian Eleven Trott works in Melbourne
0.P.0. When he was dismissed for one, in the second
innings, Postmaster-General Duffy told his deputy, with
a twinkle in his eye, that they couldn’t give a man con-
tinual leave who disgraced his province with a single, and
that Trott had better be sent up-country.

The great Grace scored one run only in two
innings against the 22 Victorian juniors. In the first
innings he was bowled for a duck.
# # *
Considering how the Englishmen crowded
round Bannerman to make the best of his stonewalling
tactics, it is wonderful how he had sufficient patience to
block in place of trying to knock their teeth out with a
loose one now and then. .
« # *
Turner is generally the mortal cricket foe of
Johunv Briggs. But on Saturday, in the crack’s first
over, the sturdy little professional smote him for eight
runs.
# * *
The reason why a brilliant batsman sometimes
disappoints his admirers is because he has had no sleep
for two nights previous to the match. Yet Sammy Jones’
record has often been—3 a.m., long beers and German
sausages; 3 p.m., 100 runs-

A. Trott, bowling for the South Melbourne
Club, the other day, killed a swallow. Fieldsmen have
been known to oatch a swallow, but this is the first ball-
bird shot on record, and consider the millions to one
chance against it.

Lohmann’s 20 wickets for 124 runs against the
Victorian juniors was a fine exhibition of sustained
bowling form, better even than Attewell’s 10 wickets
for 48.

Grace and Co. were the means of upsetting the
old-established notion that “junior” cricket is a great
sporting institution in Melbourne. To begin with, there
was but a moderate attendance .at the 12 v. 20 match on
East Melbourne ground, proving that junior contests are,
In the ordinary way, supported by boy partisans of the
various clubs, rather th»" by admirers of the game in its
highest stale of development. Secondly, it was evident
that the two or three thousand admirers of cricket as she
is played on matting had come there to worry the
Britishers. They jeered old man Grace, protested against
the possibility of any junior (youthful or fully matured)
being out 1.b.w., and tried their level best to disconcert the
visitors in the field. The larrikins have got hold of junior
cricket, seemingly, and the genuine enthusiasm that it
was said to call forth is nothing better than a parochial
spirit of rowdyism. W. G. ground his teeth when he
found that by insisting upon knocking off play at two
o'clock on the third day he had robbed the boys of a well-
deserved licking. By the way, it would be interesting to
know why, in this particular instance, a splendid turf
wicket was, as a matter of course, covered with matting,
purely in the interest of the juniors. Under, or rather
over, such foreign conditions the Englishmen can t be
beaten on their merits, any more than Jack Roberts could
be satisfactorily taken down at billiards by an Australian
who stipulated that the table should have a covering ot
linoleum.
• * *
The North Adelaide cricketers are feeling a
pain just now. With the Giffens and Jack Lyons away
from the Norwoods, they reckoned they would totally
annihilate the latter. The Norwoods made 120, and the
Norths went in gaily to wipe the score off in an hour.
They met a second eleven bowler, however, and were all
out for 88! Adelaide has now decided that only an
earthquake will shift George Giffen’s team from top
place.
r # * #
Grace’s average for all matches in Australia,
exclusive of this last international, has dropped from 40
to about 30.
# * *
All cricketers who have met W. G. Grace hold
the same opinion. Off the field an endurable personage.
On the field he plays the game like a professional card-
expert; the veteran is master of every form of “ bluff,
and appeals on the slightest pretext.
# * *
Walter Giffen in place of Gregory ! And why i
Because brother George won’t play unless brother Walter
does. When will Walter Giffen ever play an innings like
Gregory’s 44 against Victoria? And how often does a man
twice Gregory’s size lead off with six fourers as the little
bantam did in that innings ?
# # *
The argument that skill and “ dogged pluck ”
go for as much as avoirdupois weight in a tug-of-war
holds good within certain limits. In the Melbourne con-
test the heaviest team, with a pull of from six stone to
twenty-three stone over all other lots of tuggers, won
easily, whilst the three lightest “ nations” were the most
hopelessly beaten. Judged by the weight scale, Germany
made the best fight, whilst the most noticeable feature of
the whole business was the rapid demoralisation of the
’Mur’kans under adversity.
* * *
Things grow deader and deader in the English
sculling world. The latest contest for the Sportsman s
Challenge Cup was between East and Perkins, a couple of
dried-up chestnuts at the game. Perkins was still weak
from an attack of inflammation of the kidneys, and East
won by two minutes.

WHITE WINGS.
Dear Bulletin, —I was delighted to read in a
daily paner that N.S.W. National Regatta on Anniversary
Day turned out “a complete success, notwithstanding
the absence of those sailing craft which were working for
the money prizes given by the coloured sail brigade.” I
consider the attempt to vulgarize a noble sport, and turn
a healthy pastime, such as yacht-sailing, into an oppor-
tunity for gambling, is one of the most disgusting
symptoms of the money-grubbing spirit of the present
day. Nothing is more beautiful than the broad white
sails, symbolic of the winged sea-bird, sweeping over the
bosom of the waters, and the be-daubing of their snowy
surface with green moons and crimson crosses, and other
motley foolery, though it may assist the non-yachting
regatta nietallician to make up his book is neither pleasing
to the aesthetic sense, nor gratifying to the social moralist.
Neither does it assist the genuine yachtsman in making
out the craft, for there is not a boat on the harbour whose
rig, mode of construction, and manner of sailing, are not
well-known to those who are interested in aquatic matters.
The spirit of gambling has done no good to the manly
game which cricket used to be, and now it is sought to
turn yachting into a game of chance. It may be urged
that it is better for people to gather in mobs on the cliff-
heights, and on hoard harbour steamers, in the healthy
sea-breeze, than in the heated atmosphere of a gambling-
hell, or amid the debasing surroundings of the modern
racecourse ; but one cannot help regretting the disfigure-
ment of handsome craft, and the docketing of boats like
horses paraded in a saddling-paddock. One can tolerate
the red-handed sails of the Levant, but the marine clowns
that indulge in their gyratory buffooneries on the waters
of the harbour are the reverse of beautiful, and can only
subserve the gambling instincts of a people steeped to the
lips in this particular vice. Very soon there will not be a
single pastime, or a common act of everyday life, which
will escape this general curse.—Yours, Plain Sailino.

Abel’s 132 (not out) was the best performance
seen on the Sydney cricket-ground for a long long time
though perhaps Lyons’ 134 was a more dashing exhibition.
Abel went in first with W.G., and gave a chance. Then
he made 132 without giving a chance. What cricketer
does not remember Moses’ famous innings against Vic-
toria? The third ball Moses received he spooned into
point’s hands which dropped it. Then Mr. Moses, before
his light went out, complacently compiled 288 runs.
Sheffield gave Abel £5O for his performance, and promised
Lyons a handsome trophy if he broke Abel’s record.
Lyons took that trophy by just two runs.

Jackson on the head might as well hit a stone post with a
dish-cloth. The darkey has never forgotten the body
blow from Farnan which stretched him out. Powell,
Jackson’s second in that fight, says it was such a red-hot
’un that he looked for it to come through on the other
side.”
# * *
In the second International cricket match,
Lyons wagered £5O to £lOOO that ho would put up 200
runs in both innings. He scored 49 and 134 —183, thus
missing the money by 17 runs. However, he won a wager
of £lOO to £lO (laid when his first innings score stood at
42) that he wouldn’t top Abel’s first innings score.
APPRENTICE JOCKEYS.
There have of late been strong complaints about
bad riding in many important races, and curses both loud
and deep have been fired at the riders of many a well-
backed animal. After a big event recently, a first-class
judge said that had So-and-so taken oft the bridle of a
certain crack horse, and carried it in his hand, the horse
would have won the race by half-a-distance. Keeping
hold of the strings enabled the jockey to steer his mount
into fix after fix, from which it was impossible to free
himself. He thus lost ground repeatedly in numbskull
efforts to get through on the rails, and then set to and
cut the noble animal up most brutally. Of another so-
called crack, it is said that rather than cut inside, it all
the field were out at the palings, he’d try to get round
them, instead of cutting in on the rails. It is lucky that
all grown-up jockeys are not like these two. If they
were, the ring would be able to lay better odds against
favourites.
One great factor in keeping our best and most
promising riders back in the exercise of their profession
is the gross and often dishonest use made of apprentice
lads. There are scores of these children bound for four
or five years, practically without pay, to the trainers.
Their masters, to all intents and purposes, own them, body
and soul, and while they spend the best years of their life
in a penniless condition, they get nearly all the riding,
while really good, unattached horsemen are forced to
stand down and starve, or next door to it.
# # *
In every way this suits the trainer. He calmly
charges the losing-mount fee to the long-suffering owner,
and puts it in his own pocket. When, by chance, one ot
these lads wins a race, the trainer charges the owner with
the winning-fee and gravely adds: “I gave Jim (.tnc
boy) “ a score for himself on your account, and the
patient owner turns that out also with a weary sigh. Or
course the £5 and the £2O sink restfully into the capa-
cious pocket of Mr. Morning Gallop, and the boy gets
nothing once more. By the time he is free of his chains
he has got too heavy to ride the good thing in a rich
handicap, and has to stand around and see fresh young-
sters helping to enrich Mr. Gallop, while he may be
actually in want. The lad who has put hundreds ot
pounds into his master’s pocket may go to the devil tor
all that master cares, when he is no longer a milch cow,
but wants paying for his services. He may even be just a
handy weight and possess all the qualifications requisite
to ride a good thing. Does he get the mount. .Not
likely! He sees little, 12-year-old Bob. Rubbeidown put up,
loaded down into the horse’s lungs with three or four stone
of inanimate lead. If the horse wins, despite of these greed-
prompted methods of stopping him, the trainer oleais
anything from a pony to a century in fee and ‘ present to
the boy,” and it is all dead “hunoe.” Thus real jockey s
are almost robbed of their occupation, while children aie
cheated along with owners, and baby lives are daily risked
to gratify the insatiate greed of professional trainers.
» # *
This evil has another phase, and one which also
deserves the grave attention of the jockey-clubs. Any-
one gifted with ordinary powers of observation must see
that nearly every accident which occurs at Australian
race-meetings occurs in handicap events, and is almost
always caused by some scared, nervous mite, utterly
unable to control his mount, and generally put up as a
means of extracting money from the owner of the horse.
These atoms can only hope at best to stick on, and it
there is a crush or a bad corner, they have neither the
knowledge nor the ability to negotiate it, and down goes
something with usually something else atop of it. The
best proof that it is the children who cause the accidents
is the absence of disaster in welter, weight-for-age, Dei ,
Leger, and two-year-old races, not handicaps. An acci-
dent in one of these events is almost an unheard of occur-
rence, simply because qualified men have the mounts. A
rule limiting the amount of deadweight a horse shall be
allowed to carry would have a good effect in, at least,
modifying this crying evil, an evil that presses on both
“ bound boys ” and capable riders almost equally.

lot I tix upon Col. (possibly now General) Dray-
son as the cleverest man 1 ever met, although I
place Dr. Bonzano, of New Orleans, as the most
usefully scientific.
Now for my friend Drayson, Professor of Sur-
veying at the R.M.A., author of Military Sur-
veying, also of “ Pre-Adamite Man,” and latterly
of the book on whist; inventor of a cooling pro-
cess, which was applied to the Chiltern cable-ship
which came to Australia; patentee of innumer-
able inventions ; the best billiard-player (barring
Hewlett) in the British Army. What more do
you want? And this man quietlv stood up in the
octagon at the shop (Royal Mil. "Acad.) to tell us
—“Now, gentlemen, if you happen to be lost at
sea and are possessed of a sextant, a reliable
watch, and a nautical almanac, you can find your
no 3 l tion by remembering the formula as quoted
above.
.j>veet reader: I have been lost at sea and on
land. Unfortunately, I never possessed the
reliable chronometer ; I despise sextants and
acknowledge nothing under a transit-instrument;
the only value of Dietrischen and Hanney’s
Nautical Almanac lies in the army list. And
still I honour and respect Dicky Drayson.
Here let me go out into the night to breathe a
quiet curse on the subject of my story, whom I
lately saw.
Chap. Alpha and Omega. That woman.
On board the yacht Bedouin, the house-boat of
my cousin, John William Lynns. A merry party,
slightly damped by a blue-stocking of a girl
called Jardine. And the scene is the Kyles'of
Bute. One cannot choose a better place for the
commencement of love. Later on I’ll tell you
where to fix on the end.
This woman had some money of her own and I
had none or next to none. What’s the use of
a hundred a-year and your pay of five-and-seven-
pence a-day, when you have the ambition and
temporary possibilities of a thousand ?
I coveted Jane Jardine’s modest lac: and that
is the Hindi for ten thousand pounds.
But I loved Janey J. Confound her, she pre-
tended to love me.
I said she was a blue-stocking. She wanted to
learn navigation, and for two weeks I tried hard
to teach her Drayson’s formula that the zenith
distance, plus or minus the declination, will give
the latitude.
On board the Bedouin, they called Janey my
zenith because the idiots heard the word so often.
Then an Australian stepped on board at Helens-
burgh. He was a merchant. All Australiatis are
merchants or squatters or C.M.G.’s.
My word (expression learned in Australia), he
could yarn and spin a cuffer about his stores and
business at Saint Tiberius, in Yicadelaide.
About this time Janey Jardine discovered that
her intellect was not capable (mark that word) of
Nome’s (Epitome or Drayson’s Surveying, and
married the Australian merchant.
Since then I have seen the pair. He was a
tobacconist in Melbourne ; a general storekeeper
and butcher in Saint Tiberias, and is now a pot-
bel—l mean a respectable squatter and M.L.C. in
one of the colonies. Last week (review Moore
Park : haw-haw ; greatly pleased ; efficiency, equal
any troops in the world ; loyalty, royalty, cheers,
beers, sneers) I met Janey Jardine, now Mrs.
Honourable (within the colony) Beeranbeef.
1 did not want to renew her acquaintance;
officialdom brought us within speaking distance,
and this is what she said: “Philomenostatos
Scott, don’t you remember the Zenith?”
I did not want to be rude; her manner was
friendly ; but the old wound gave my spleen a
turn, and seeing that her corsets were about GO,
what could I say but “Apparently, Mrs. Beeran-
beef, you have now found the latitude.”
Still, those old landings at Colintraive
and Ard-na-murchan can’t be forgotten; and
I am a welcome guest at the house of the Hon.
(within the colony) Beeranbeef, who is ten years
older than I. How shall it end ? I begin again
to love Janey and her ten thousand and the
agglomerated fortune of Beeranbeef !
Weep not for the dead, neither bemoan him;
but weep rather for him that goeth into a far
country.
Beeranbeef has gout. I am tolerably healthy.
How shall it end ? A great question. How shall
it end ?
SCOTTY THE WRINKLER.
“Being Irish, they never insulted women”
—such is the eulogy of the Kelly Gang, in one of
the last London papers, evidently from the hand
of a young man from Dublin—or Jimmy Hogan.
Reminds you of Robin Hood’s “I never robbed a
poor man yet.”
An American scientist lias, after much
experiment, succeeded in depriving a noisy dog of
the power to bark. The tyke still goes through
all the motions —wags its tail and opens his mouth
but no sound comes forth. The Bulletin joyfully
anticipates the application of this treatment to
the War Cry squawkers of the Harmy.

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS
Proving the Wonderful Cures to be Genuine. (
*« Herr Rassmussen’s World-famed Denmark Universal Pills are
purely Herbal, and is tbe best remedy in the world for curing and
preventing disease.” —The Times. ,
“Herr Rassmussen’s, the Celebrated Danish Herbalist, well- j
known Herbal Remedies have been the means of performing many I
gre&t cures during tlie last few years, as his numerous testi- /
menials will prove,”— Sydney Bulletin.
“ Herr R AssMussENhas shown us some highly complimentary (
Testimonials which he has received, certifying to important
cures effected by his Remedies.”— Sydney Evening News, ,
“We have been shown some excellent Testimonials of tbe
great cures performed by Herr Eassmussen, the Celebrated
Danish Herbalist. Herr Eassmussen is a gentleman who has
gained for himself a reputation in the medical world of herbal
science. He has been practising as a qualified herbalist so long in
Sydney that his name has become_ known throughout hew Soutn (
Wales and Australia.”— Australian Star ,
“ We are continually receiving letters from Herr Eassmussen s
Cured Patients, requesting us to make known the wonderful
virtues his world-renowned Herbal Remedies contain.’
Sydney Weekly News.
“ Herr Eassmussen’s name has become a household word
throughout the Southern Hemisphere. He was presented with a
magnificent Gold Medal for some of his marvellous cures.
Balmain Leader.
“ Herr Eassmussen is too well and favourably known to the
Australian public to require any additional praise from Truth.
His Herbal Remedies are unequalled.”— Sydney Truth.
“ The remarkable Cures effected by Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal
Remedies are pretty generally known.”— Balmain Observer.
“Herr Eassmussen, we are glad to say, as a Medical Herbalist,
holds the highest place in the Colonies, and enjoys the confidence of
many of the leading people in N.S. Wales, Victoria, and Queens-
land.”— Cooktown Courier, Queensland,
“Herr Eassmussen counts his cures by thousands, has already
acquired an Australian Reputation, and has secured the respect
and gratitude of numerous patients whom his remedies has
restored to Health and Happiness.”— Centennial History
of N.S.W.
“Herr Eassmussen’s Remedies have cured more diseases than
all the other remedies put together.” — Republican.
“Who have not heard of the numerous Cures effected by Herr
Eassmussen’s Denmark Universal Pills.”—Australian Friend.
“ All the principal Analysts and Medical Experts have proclaimed
Here Rassmussen’s Denmark Universal Pills to be the best in
the world.”— Medical Herbalist Journal.
“Herr Eassmussen is a skilled botanist.” Launceston
Daily Telegraph, Tasmania.
“It may not be out of place to mention that Herr Eassmussen
has now been established iu the colonies for nearly 10 years.”
Sydney Sunday Times,
“Herr Eassmussen is no doubt one of the most successful
Medical Practitioners in these colonies, judging from bis enormous
practice and bis wonderful cures, and his great skill has been
recognised iu many ways. He has also beeu rewarded with a
magnificent Gold Medal for effecting wonderfu.l cures ” — Sydney
Freedom.
A REAL MAN OP MARK.
“ Herr Eassmussen’s Cures are so remarkable that we make no
apology for referring to some of them. Mr. Ramsdeu’s case is the
most wonderful, and he cured him in six weeks, after all the
Sydney doctors gave him up. We may also state that a gentleman
in this district, who has been a martyr to the demon Dyspepsia for
more than two years, after trying several “doctors” with no
benefit whatever, is recovering under Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal
Treatment. In this age of unblushing quackery it is well to find
a man of Herr Rassmusseu’s undoubted skill, and we wish him a
lone life to continue bis useful mission in the cause of suffering
humanity.”— -Kangaroo Valley Pioneer, N-S.W.
A JUST REWARD.
Herr Eassmussen, of whose Famous Herbal Remedies everybody
has beard, is yet a youug man, and has held the position of Lecturer
to several Botanic Societies in Australia; he soon became known by
his wonderful cures of which be has numerous tokens of grateful,
ness including a beautiful Gold Medal, brought him into tbe front
rank of Botanic Scientists ; now be is tbe Proprietor and Discoverer
of the famous Denmark Herbal Remedies, all of which have
secured tbe honest support of tbe people, not only of Australia,
but Africa, tbe United States, tbe British Kingdom and Italy.
It is not for us to enumerate the various remedies prepared by this
really learned man, but having seen and examined letters from all
parts of tbe world, we are assured that be has saved a world of
suffering and cured people of many complaints, after they had
given up all hope.”— The Australian Workman.— Sydney,
January 9tb, 1892.

The Age seems to be incurably stupid in
its royal obituary notices. A cablegram announc-
ing the death of the Ozar’s uncle, in his 65th year,
was followed by a compound of extracts from
ancient and modern biographies, which repre-
sented the defunct Grand Duke as having “once
ventured to arrest his elder brother , the present
Czar of Russia,” and then concluded a hopeless
entanglement of references to “late emperor,”
“ new emperor,” and “the emperor,” with a plain,
comprehensible statement that “ in 1890 the uncle
of the Ozar was suddenly afflicted with the loss of
his reason,” No wonder. A man who started
life (in the Age) as the younger brother of his
nephew, would naturally go off his chump
sooner or later. There’s no fathoming the
mystery of royal history writing in these
“great” responsible newspapers. Here, perhaps,
is a case of tacking a piece of comparatively recent
intelligence to a yarn that had been set-up in the
Age office, ready against emergency, since a date
anterior to the nitro-glycerineing of poor Czar
Alexander II. But the recent mistake in describ-
ing Her Gracious Maj. as the Duchess of Teck’s
sister is not to be accounted for on a similar
hypothesis. One of David Syme’s gifted staff
must have manufactured that relationship out of
his own fat head, and we hope nothing of the sort
will occur again. There are now so many princesses
and grand-dukes and things that the Age can’t
sort ’em out.
One of the best-known characters in the
N.S.W. northern district, and especially about
Merriwa, is “Billy Munro.” The genial Billy
was, and still is, in the habit of now and then
running a score up for liquor supplied at the
various local “ Grands ” and other pubs, with less
pretentious names. After a round of drinks had
been supplied, he would exclaim : “Put that down
to Billy Munro.” It became a sort of second
nature with the shearers and locals around
Merriwa to hear “ Billy’s ” brief exclamation; so
that, in course of time, when “Billy,” had
settled up and departed on a cruise to some
other part of the country, a local, on ordering
drinks, would exclaim, with a sigh of satisfaction :
“Put that down to Billy Munro.” Billy’s pet
phrase at last became as popular and natural as
“ What’ll yer ’ave ?” From the rouseabout to the
squatter they all said “Put ’em down,” &c.
During the old chap’s absence —a couple of years—
a new and handsome Hebe had arrived to superin-
tend the mixing of gin and peppermint. To her
the inimitable “Billy” was a wild, hilarious
myth. For instance, when Mr. Blank, a farmer,
called in for a beer, he would say “ Put that down
to Billy Munro.” Of course Hebe would
smile and put it down to Mr. Blank. However,
one fine day the old, original William turned
up. He dropped into the bar where the “ new
gal ” was and called for a long beer ; after he had
demolished it he rattled off the old observation
“ put that down to Billy Munro.” The charmer
behind the counter laughed. “ Yes,” she said,
“ but to whom shall I put ’em down ? ” “ Why !”
roared Billy, “ to me, to Billy Munro." “Yes,”
said Hebe, “ they all say that when they get
drinks; but there’s no such person, is there?”
“Isn’t there,” yelled our hero —“who told yer
that, young ’ooman ? ” The old chap couldn’t
convince her until an old beer-chewcr, who was
hanging round, identified “Billy” in true Rip
Van Winkle style. William raved a-while, but
was at last pacified when told that life without the
use of Billy’s name, in that part at least, was like
a London Journal story without the black-haired
villain.

WOMAN'S RIGHTS & DAYS OF CHIVALRY
That strange growth of creation, the strong-
minded female, continues to pine for an extension
of her rights, political and otherwise ; and sighs
because what she calls “the days of chivalry”
are past. Well, perhaps they are, and it’s a good
job, too ! The phrase sounds very nice, but boil it
down to stern realism, and what does it mean?
It means an era when galvanised iron cavaliers
rushed at each other with sharpened clothes-props
for the honor of some “ ladye fayre.” Those '
times were not without their little drawbacks.
There were hardly any baths then, and the
“ladyes” mostly retired with their clothes on.
A quart of water was considered quite enough
for five girls to wash with, excepting in winter
time when they generally satisfied themselves
with a dry polish. It was the correct thing also
at dinner parties for a lady and gentleman to eat
off the same plate, and the one who could exhibit
the quickest despatch came in for the best share,
and reached for the other’s last piece of fat.
There were no tram-cars in those days, and con-
sequently no chance for the stout lady with a
plethoric handbag, a wet umbrella and innumer-
able parcels to crush herself and impediments into
an already overcrowded smoking-compartment
and look unutterable things at the unhappy male
creatures, who neglected, immediately her
presence blocked the doorway, to extinguish their
smoking idols, and bow her to half a dozen seats.
A return to the “ ancyent dayes ” would spoil all
this, and would, besides, deprive mankind of many
blessings already enjoyed. Foremost amongst
these is that greatest of all modern discoveries St.

The Waterbury Watches are meeting with
genuine approval on all sides. They sell upon
their merits. A discerning public has not been
slow to recognise that they are accurate,
convenient, stylish in appearance, carefully con-
structed, and with absolutely interchangeable
parts. Their nominal price, too, is by no means
an unimportant feature. In the series for ladies
great improvements are to be noted, and these are
now turned out of a pattern and finish that cannot
fail to please the most fastidious. A word of
caution, however, is necessary. Don’t be misled
into buying inferior imitations of the Waterbury,
manufactured in Germany or Switzerland, and not
infrequently exhibited for sale ensconced in
Waterbury silk-lined boxes the better to deceive
the unwary purchaser. Intending purchasers of
the genuine articles should note that every watch
manufactured by the Waterbury Watch Co. has
one or both of the following distinctive marks on
the dial, viz., the word “WATERBURY” (in
fine type) and the interwoven letters “W. W.

Brady’s Luck.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It became quite a by-word on the Adelaide Lead,
for Brady’s luck was so glaringly bad that, as his
friend and late partner, Doodle-doo Henry, put
it, “ It was worse than no luck at all.”
Brady himself was a well-known character in
and around Ballarat. He had been in his time
digger, cook, station-hand, mailman, stockman,
everything in turn and nothing long.' But during
all the time of his various and varied experiences,
Ballarat had always been a kind of head-centre
with him, to which he repaired whenever oppor-
tunity and the state of his funds permitted. When
there he always took a short spell at digging, but
his luck not taking any encouraging change for the
better, he generally threw up pick and shovel after
a few weeks or months of tentative labour, and
returned to other scenes and more promising
pursuits.
At last, however, after some years of knocking
about Victoria and N.S.W. he returned to Ballarat
for good and all, trying his luck with the other
diggers in the gullies and flats around. After a
while he took up his residence in what w r as then
known as the Adelaide Lead, and from the pecu-
liarities of his manners and appearance, as well as
in consequence of the phenomenally bad luck that
persistently followed him, soon became an
“identity” there and throughout the Ballarat
district generally. As to what he called his
“luck,” he had a very plausible theory which
he would explain in the following original way :
“You see, I was born with a caul, and everyone
knows as thg,t means luck. My mother—as has
been dead and buried these 40 years, a knowin’
old soul she was—she always said to me, ‘ Take
care of yourself, Judd, for you was born lucky,
and lucky you’ll be afore you die ’ —and if she
didn’t know the rights of it, I reckon nobody
don’t. All the doctors’ll - tell you it’s a lucky thing
to be born with a caul—it’s a regular medicil fact,
you’ll find it in them doctors’ books plain enough.
‘Takqcareof that caul, Judd,’ says ray mother
afore she went, ‘ never you part with it, for it’ll
bring you luck some day ; but if you lose it, then
it's all up with you.’ And I’ve taken jolly good
care to stick to it. I’ve worn it round my neck
night and day in this bit of a shammy bag, here
under my shirt, and I couldn’t part with it for
nothing. It’s bound to bring me luck some day,
and I reckon that day can’t be far off now. You
see, I’m 52, and I haven’t had any luck to speak of
yet, so it’s a moral the change will have to coirfe
soon. If it don’t,” he continued, a little less con-
fidently, “it’ll be too late to do me much good.”
It was in consequence of these representations
that Brady had been from time to time taken on
as a mate by several of the diggers on the lead.
Sentiment was most certainly not in vogue in that
boisterous life of the goldfields, nor did super-
stitious feeling exercise any appreciable influence
on the diggers, but in the minds of the few who
extended their friendship to the ancient there
was the thought that “ there was no harm in
giving the old geyser a show, and seoin’ if there
was anything in his bloomin’ luck.”
But in every case his co-operation was found to
bring anything but luck, and he was speedily
dropped. His best days were long past; his
strength and endurance were hot what they had
been, and he was found incapable of doing a hard
day’s work. First one tried him and gave him
hp, then another, and so it went on until he had
passed from man to man, and at length found
himself deserted by all, and looked upon —in con-
junction with his “luck”—with ridicule and
derision.
But Brady, in his way, was a philosopher, and
never lost faith in himself and his luck. His last
mate was a man known as Doodle-doo Henry—so
called from his invariable greeting of “ How do
you doodle-do ?” In parting with his mate, this
worthy had given utterance to the expression that
“Brady’s luck was worse than no luck at all,” and
this Brady himself had taken up with unreason-
able warmth.
“Of course, you know all about it,” he replied,
scornfully. “ A cove like you knows everything,
doesn’t he? A man would think you’d been
eddicated at college, by the flash way you talk.
But you ain’t read medical doctors’ books for all
that, or you’d know that a caul always brings
luck sooner or later. There ain’t nothin’ surer
than that. I’m not saying as you’re wrong in
wanting to work your claim by yourself. That’s
as how you Aggers it out to yourself. But you
young fellers have never got any head on you.
You’re too flash and snorty altogether. Why !by
waiting another few months —or maybe, even
days—there’s no telling what mightn’t have
turned up for you and me. But I ain’t complain-
ing,” he continued, a little wistfully, slowly
shouldering pick and shovel and turning away.
“There’s others as knows what’s what better than
you, and I won’t be long before I have another
mate, I know.”
His belief in himself and his luck was almost
pathetic, so entire and unqualified was it; but
unfortunately after the experience of Doodle-
doo Henry and the others, the rest of the diggers
on the Adelaide Lead did not view the matter in
the same light at all. They all refused his proffers
of partnership, and for a longtime the poor fellow
wandered round the different camps, solitary and
neglected. _
But he succeeded at last in picking up a mate,
and returning to the Lead with him in tow, soon
regained his customary cheerfulness.
Brady’s new mate was almost a boy, and, as
was soon made apparent, a new-chum. There
was no mystery about him at all, for he was open
enough as to his antecedents. By his own con-
fession he was a sailor and had served two voyages
from England to Australia before the mast. But
tiring of the sea and wishing to try his luck on
the diggings, he had left his ship and tramped it
from Melbourne to Ballarat. He gave his name
as Jim, quickly made friends with the men, and
set to work with very little loss of time.
Being asked what had prompted him to join an
old man like Brady, he answered quite good-
temperedly, “ Well, you see, being a new hand at
it, I thought it’d be best to get a messmate as
knew the ropes, so’s to put me in the way a bit
till I could get shipshape. You see, lads, digging
for gold’s different from working afore the mast,
and I’m out of my reckoning altogether. Besides,
my mate showed me a caul he’s got, and sailors
always take that as a lucky thing. So not having
anything better to lay to, I signed articles with
old Brady here, and we’ve agreed to work together
till something good turns up, which I hope won’t
be long a-lcming.”
He was such a hearty young fellow and had
' such vague ideas as to mining, that to the prac-
tical workers on the Adelaide Lead it seemed like
flying in the face of Providence that so much good
material should be thrown away on old Brady,
and several offers of shares in claims were made
to him. But he refused them all with a laugh and
a jest, electing to stick by his first choice.
“A fine feller I’d be,” he said, “ desarting a
shipmate afore the first week or two. ."ailors
ain’t built that way, it ain’t their natur. I won’t
go back on the old fellow-not so long as he
treats me fair.”
On his part, Brady evinced great admiration
and liking for his newly-found mate, and was
never tired of expatiating on his many good
qualities of head and heart. ~
“He’s a fine fellow is young Jim,” he would
say to anyone who would listen to him. “Sailors
are mighty taking in their ways, and young Jim’s
one of the best I’ve come across. The sea’s a
great eddicater, boys-it kind of opens a cove’s
eyes. That young Jim he’s got mighty good
ideas in his head, for all he’s a youngster. Oh,
him and me get on first-rate. We’re down 20
feet with the shaft, and things look pretty
promisin’. I guess the luck’s goin’ to change now.
I knew it was hound to come sooner or later, and
I’m glad I’ve got a mate like young Jim. It’ll
make both our fortunes, and, by the Hokey ! I’ll
make a man of him. He’s just the right sort for
me ; I wouldn’t ask for a better mate.”
But alas for poor old Brady and his luck!
Somehow the change did not come. They
bottomed their claim and found—to use a digging
phrase—they had been “sinking a grummet.”
Disheartened but not beaten, they pegged out
another claim, worked at it energetically for a
month or so, got a few pennyweights of gold out
of it and then gave it up in despair and tried
another. The storekeeper on the Lead began to
look sour when young Jim entered his bark
emporium for his weekly rations. There had been
no monev forthcoming for some time, and the
account Was running up. The luck had most
certainly not come yet, and every day it was
wanted more and more. Young Jim’s laugh was
heard less and less frequently ; he hardly ever
whistled now—and before it had been so shrill and
loud. Even old Brady—used to reverses as he
had been all through bis arduous life—seemed to
feel the position more keenly than formerly. His
simple faith in the luck that was bound to come
never for an instant faltered, but otherwise he
grew melancholy, and at times irritable.
During their fei» months of intimacy, an almost
fatherly affection for his young mate seemed to
have grown up in his heart, and it was as much on
the young man’s account as on his own, that he
secretly bewailed the unkind fate that stood
between him and his “luck.”
“ What’ll he think of me at all ?” he often said
to himself; “and me making on as we’d be sure
to have a streak of luck. He’ll be jacking up on
it, sure as death. But it’ll come if he’ll only
wait. There ain’t nothing surer nor that. But
it’s a main long time—a main long time, and it’s
weary waiting for a young feller.”
Poor old Brady ! It was weary waiting for him
too. Such weary waiting, that suddenly his hope-
ful spirit gave way, and with it health and
strength and energy. The immediate physical
cause of his sudden break-up was a cold contracted
by standing in their wet claim, and neglected
with the usual miner’s disregard of all the most
ordinary laws of health. The poor old fellow
took to his bunk, and never rose from it. He
gradually sank, growing each day weaker and
nearer his end. It was a complete break-up of
the system, and the doctor from Ballarat, sum-
moned hastily by the young sailor, gave little
hope from the first.
“ It’s all up with old Brady this time,” the old
man said one evening, “and I ain’t sorry I've
struck the right lead at last. I’ve been knockin’
round these here colonies ’till it’s nigh time I had
a rest of some sort. And I’m going where I’ll
have a good long one, if them parsons speak true.
But, look you here, my lad ; I'm sorry to go and
leave you. I am, true. I reg’larly collared to
you from the first, and I ses to myself directly I
cast eyes on you, ‘ That’s the cove as I’d like to
whack my luck with.’ 1 did, on my word. And
you’ve been a good mate to me, and a kind one,
too. You're looking arter me now kind and
thoughtful-like, and sitting with me here ’sted of
going and joining the other young fellers at the
public. I knew I’d got the right sort of a mate
when I’d got you.”
“You’re paying out too much rope, mate,”
answered the young sailor. “I ain’t no great
chalks. Avast a bit, and see if you can’t tackle a
morsel of grub.”
“No, I couldn’t, Jim,” he answered, seriously.
“ I don’t think I’ll be on the eat again— not hearty
like. But, see you here. I want to give you this.
I’ve worn it round my neck, man and boy, these
fifty years and more. It ain’t brought much luck
to me—not yet, but it’ll bring it to you instead,
which’ll be all the same. Take it, Jim, and keep
it. It’s too late now for it to do me much good,
but you’ll get it sure.”
The young sailor took it, half credulously, half
to please the invalid, and Brady, with a satisfied
sigh, soon fell off into a broken slumber.
He slept on and off during the night and the
greater part of next day, but his slumber was dis-
turbed and restless, and he awoke weaker than
before. During the evening his young mate left
him and hurried down to the public-house, where
most of the men on the Lead were accustomed to
assemble. Then he told them of the old man’s
plight, and so urgently represented his want of
money to buy the ordinary necessaries for the sick
man, that the minds of ids heareis were moved,
and a collection was made then and there and
handed to young Jim.
As Doodle-doo. Henry said, with a regretful
oath, “ There wasn’t any harm in old Brady. He
was straight enough only for that blessed maggot
he’d got in his head about his luck; so that now
he was down on his luck, poor old devil, it was
time for the boys to chip in and help a bit.”
With part of" the money given him, Jim bought
a few things for the invalid, and returned to his
post by his bunk. When Brady woke up, his
eyes brightened at sight of the young man.
“Are you there still, Jim?” he said, weakly.
“Well, now, that’s good of you. There ain’t
many would have stopped Dy a old Derwenter
like me. What’s that you’ve got? A bottle of
wine for me as the boys sent, thinking it might
do mo good ? Well, now ; I do call that friendly.
They’ve often made fun of old Brady, but I knew
their hearts was in the right place. But it ain’t
wine as’ll do me any good, Jim. I’ve sent my last
pick home. I only want a rest now—a good, long
rest. See here, Jim, my boy ; when I’m stiff I’d
like you to plant me away from the camp—some-
where in the bush where no one won’t disturb me.
You know that there big flowering gum down the
gully? Put me somewhere there, Jim, will you?
I’d like to be all by myself, shaded-like.”
The next day poor Brady breathed his last.
Almost his last words were, “Don’t lose the caul,
Jim; it’ll bring you luck as sure as death.” Then
with a half-remembered prayer on his lips he
quietly died.
- “ Poor old beggar !” said Doodle-doo Henry,
coming up half-an-hour afterwards to see how the
patient was progressing, “I’m sorry he’s gone.
There wasn’t any harm in him, but, by ginger 1
there was more kinds of fools mixed up in him
than in any other man in Ballarat. Say, Jim;

I’ll stop and give you a hand to bury him, now
I’m here.”
“ No, I won’t do it to-night,” said Jim. “He
asked me to lay him along the gully there, where
hfe’d be quiet. It won’t take me long to knock
out a only it’s the gittin’of him there.' If
you’ll lexm me your horse and cart to-morrow, I’ll
manage the rest by myself.”
“Right you are,” answered the other, “You
can get ’em whenever you wantand having
done his duty, according to his lights, Doodle-
doo Henry went off with an exhilarated feeling
of having acted with quite exceptional ChrVitian
kindness.
Early next-morning the young sailor set about
the performance of his last service for hi# mate.
By the aid of Doodle-doo Henry’s wall-eyed
horse, he conveyed the body, covered decently by
a cloth, to the spot down the gully which Brady
had indicated. A large gum with drooping
fronds grew in the very centre of the miniature
defile, shading it and the low slopes that rounded
away on either sides. It was a pretty, grassy
spot, quiet and retired, where the sound of labour
on the Lead hardly pentrated.
Unharnessing the quiet horse, Jim allowed it
to feed about in the gully, and prepared for the
task of digging the grave. He cast one look at
the motionless form on the dray, and then set to
work with pick and shovel. He worked on for
about half-an-hour until he had dug a hole two or
three feet deep. Then he stopped, lifted himself
out, and made a step towards the dray.
“ No,” he muttered, “ I’ll bury him decent.
I’ll go down another foot or so.”
He jumped into the hole again, and commenced
using his pick vigorously. Three—four strokes
sounded with a hollow thud, and then all at once
a muttered exclamation broke from him; “By
George ! she’s stuck.” He was so wholly inex-
perienced, he had no idea what it was. He tried
to extricate the pick, but in vain; the point
seemed to be firmly imbedded. Then he took his
shovel and began digging the clay out round the
buried pick. A minute later a second cry rose to
his lips—but this time shrill, broken, and trium-
phant. He worked on, shovelling away the
sticky clay, with straining eagerness, and then
seizing hold of the handle of the buried pick, with
a mighty effort, tore it from the ground. Then
thrusting it up to its head in the loosened clay,
he used it as a lever. A huge mass, clay-covered
and yellow, was forced slowly upwards.
“ My God !” the young man cried, hoarsely,
“ I’ve got it at last. It’s a solid nugget.”
Discoloured and clay-covered as it was, there
was no mistaking it.
It was virgin gold.
Brady’s Luck had come at last.

“Vesper.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The fringed blinds flap gently in the
evening breeze, which steals through the aperture
of the raised window. Fearful that the sound,
though it is soft as the murmur passing through
lovers’ lips to lure their lovers’, may disturb the
patient, the snowy-capped nurse moves to fasten
the drapery. She touches it lightly, and the
blind, being but lately hung on its window,
anspors to the spring and flies with a rustle to
coil itself around its roller. Vexed with herself for
what she considers her carelessness, the nurse,
while reaching her hand to the tassel to pull
down the blini once more, turns her eyes towards
the feed to see if the sick man has been awakened.
He needs sleep so much; sleep, if he is to be
saved from death, will be his salvation; and—
ah ! the noise has awoke him! He makes with
his head that half-turn on his pillow which is all
the movement his strength —his weakness, rather
—will permit. And his eyes stare pitifully from
the sockets into whose hollowness melt a thousand
fine wrinkles, each one the impress of a separate
pang. Six weeks before those wrinkles had no
place on the full, rounded cheeks that curved
only in laughter or smiles. And now the contour
has subsided into sharp angularities, and the flesh
has been burnt away underneath the skin which
hangs so loosely on the bones. Six weeks ago he
was a man for whom women might hunger—and
now? So gaunt and hideous a thing is he that he
dreads, in his occasional lapses into consciousness,
that he is repellant even to the “sister” of the
ward. But the good nurse sees only the patient,
and not the man. There is no sex in sickness.
“ Nurse !” The lips shape though they cannot
be said to utter the syllable.
She pulls the blind to the sill, and hastens to
his side, stooping over him to hear his words. He
moves his head again in a fashion that would be
deemed to be petulant Were he in health, and
makes her understand that he wishes the blind to
remain up, and not down. She returns to the
window, and eases the cord so that the tassel
presses noiselessly against, and rebounds from the
upper frame. And she steps aside, so that he
shall gaze out into the realm of the falling night.
She would raise him on his pillow, but she dare
not. So near is he to the Verge, the movement
might push him over.
The distressed brain that is as yet not fully
certain that the thing it sees is of this nether
world, and not an appanage of some other sphere,
strives valiantly to settle the doubt by endeavour-
ing to identify the mountain peak that thrusts
itself sombrely into the gold of the western sky.
But the forehead puckers yet more numerously as
the name eludes the weakened memory, and the
lips seek an utterance which will not come.
Then the glory of the sun-setting passes sud-
denly, and the ruddiness and the gold, and the
streaks of amethyst, and the puff-balls of fleecy
cloudlets that seem to have wandered from
. . . The place where white dreams dwell
And wreathe an unseen shrine,
lose their splendour in a moment, for over their
magnificence drops a purple shadow. It isasthough
some artist, of a genius so lofty as to make him
worthy to emblazon the walls of heaven itself, had
wrought a work too marvellous for human sight
to bear, and, in sudden contempt for the poor
mortal intelligence, drapes his great achievement
with a velvet pall. As the light goes out of the
sky, and the black peak merges its outline in the
mass of purple, a chill enters the room. The
nurse feels it, and instantly," fearing fbr her
charge, lowers the under-sash which had been
raised.
The top-frarneof the sash had stretched a black bar
across the upper pane. The window lowered, the
bar disappears, and
A sorrowing cry which was not all sorrow, but
held a note of joy, like that which rings a cadence
through a new-rnother’s agony, startles the house.
“Vesper! O Vesper ! My darling— come ! ”
He had risen in hia bed, and held out his arms
toward the west. There, gleaming lucidly above
the point of deepest darkness which marked the
mountain peak, shone the Evening Star. Virginal
in the beauty which bore witness to the death of
the day, she flashed into the room —and carried
him thence.
# * #
The door of the ward is opened carefully.
It is the night-nurse come to relieve the day-one.
But the latter will not go. He had called her
“ mercenary,” had the man who now lay dead,
when the fever had begun to work fiercely upon
him. , “Begone!” he had exclaimed; “I will
have no mercenary hands to touch me —give me
those sanctified by love, or none at all ! ’ And
then, in the next breath, he would tell her he was
but a wastrel, and his people had cast him off, and
it had come to this that in the battle for life he
shouldbave no ally* but the hired nurse. Mer-
cenary, in that she rendered the offices of tender-
ness for money, she was ; but not otherwise. Else
she had not given her hard-won evening leisure to
preparing him for his coffin.
“ If you do not mind, nurse !” said the “ day-
duty ” to the “ night-relief,” “ I will lay him out.”
And the “night-relief ” was but too willing, for
the final service to the dead-clay was repugnant to
her.
“ Have you reported the death ? ” she asks.
“ No—not yet ! ” replies the other. “ Will you
do it for me ? ”
The “ night-relief ” takes the patient’s card from
the mantel (it is a private ward, and therefore
the card is not suspended at the head of the bed)
and passes to the door, to inform the matron and
the doctor. The matron, however, meets her in
the cdrridor. She carries a paper in her hand.
“ Haw is private ward’s temperature to-night?
I have a telegram for him, but do not think I
shall give it to him.”
“ A telegram—oh ! He’s—gone !”
“Ah!. Poor girl!” and the matron hurries to
the room.
A candle has been lit, and the flame flickers in
the draught of her entrance. A beam falls
aslant on his face, and as the cheeks are already
witnessing that resurrection of colour which so
often lights the pyre of death with the fire of
youth, the three women fancy, for the moment,
he is not dead but sleeping, and smiling in his
sleep. For the moment only.
Then the matron reads out to the nurses, who
had seen many deaths, but were touched by this
one peculiarly because of the life that was now
speeding on its way to the chamber, the tele-
gram—:
“ Arrived,- beloved. Fast as love can bring me,
I come.- —Vesper.”
And when the day-nurse has clad him in his
cere-clothes, she places between the crossed
palms the bit of official paper. And the regula-
tions of the institution are violated, for the
hospital-morgue will not receive its tenant this
night. And the night-nurses steal out in the mid-
night and strip the Marguerite bushes of their
snow-stars, and weave in the still hours a tinj
cross and a great wreath. And Vesper comes,
with the dawn, with the dust of long travel upon
her garments, but in her eyes the quenchless light
of a fathomless love; Quenchless ! But dimmed
then, and while life endures.

“A First Family.”
I.—Burke’s “Colonial Gentry,” Yol. 1.
The De Blankes, of Potts Point, Sydney, and
Wurramurradurra Downs, Lachlan District,
N.S.W., are a cadet-branch of the family of
which Lord De. Blanke, Baron Gonbroke, of
Diddleum Hall, shire, England, is head. (Vide
Burke’s Peerage ). The founder of the colonial
branch, Gavan De Blanke, was one of the earliest
settlers, &c., &c., &,c. . .
IL—The Bulletin’s “Burke,” Yol. 1 (Revised
Edition. )
The trial of Gavan De Blanke took place at the
Old Bailey Sessions on 9th Dec., 178-.
He was indicted for feloniously assaulting John
Pemberton Hey wood, Esq., on the King’s High-
way, on the 13th day of July last, in the parish
of Finchley, and putting him in bodily fear and
danger of his life; and feloniously taking vrom
his person, and against his will, a silk purse,
value Is. ; a base metal watch, value 405.; steel
chain, value Is. ; four cornelian seals, set in gold,
value <£B; a real morocco-leather tweezer case,
value Id. ; six guineas ; a crown piece and 9s. ;
and piece of foreign, copper coin, value one-
farthing, his property.
On Finchley Common, two men, mounted,
stopped prosecutor’s ehair and presented pistols.
Prosecutor declared Ire knew the gentlemen, and
that the lower part of the face of one, clear of the
crape, was like Gavan, as he had met him
several times at a friend’s in York. Prosecutor
told a friend : “If I was not sure that Gavan
de Blanke was not out of the Kingdom
(as he then supposed), I should be sure it was
him,” adding “he has a pretty strong Irish
brogue. I thought him a very agreeable young
man.” Had not seen him since robbery till he
saw him at Bow-street.
The question was one of identity. Mr. Garrow,
accused’s pleader, was asked by the Court if he
had any witnesses, and replied “No.” The
Court: “ Would the prisoner say anything?” Mr.
Garrow: “No, my Lord, on this occasion.”
Verdict: “Not guilty.”
Prosecutor; “My Lord, Mr. De Blanke, the
prisoner at the bar, says he has taken a passage to
go in the fleet to Botany Bay, and has obtained an
appointment in it as purser, and desires to be
discharged immediately.”
The Court : “ Let him be discharged.”

Fair or Foul?
“ The head was severed from the trunk, the lower part
of which was covered with loose earth. There were,
however, no signs of foul play visible.”—Sydney T).T.
The body lay all stark and busted,
The head had rolled a yard away,
The axehead in the brain had rusted,
T.ie body half-concealed with clay ;
The thorax was plugged up with lead,
The copper knowed the cove was dead,
Vet, as he spat and scratched his head,
J’oliceman Brine, he up and said—
“ Oi wondher how he kum this way,
There ain’t no thraces av foul play.”
Gore gouts were scattered on the ground,
The hands were full of rags and hair,
The viscera were strewed around,
Chops, cuts, and gashes great were there,
The stomach full of arsenic,
Enough to make a regiment sick,
B side the corpse a blood-stained pick,
Across it lay a clotted stick,
Yet Brine said, as he turned away—
“ There ain’t no thraces av foul play.”
And then, with pain and anguish great,
Brine formulated his report,
lie ground his teeth and scratched his pate,
As every zealous copper ought;
Ho knowed the man was dead, he wrote,
He’d tuk ther body down by boat,
A hinquich next he wint to float,
And showed the bloody shirt and coat,
And to the Crowner grave did say—
“ There worn’t no thraces av foul play.”
Casterfcon and Hamilton (Western Vic.)
people are just boiling over at the discovery that
Milner M‘Master (“Viator” of the Melbourne
D.T. and now of the Age) in his novel “ Our
Pleasant Vices,” has satirised some of their
district notabilities and unnotabilities. M‘Master
was for a time editor of the Casterton News, a
one-horse sheet owned by E. E. Hughes, who
bought it from W. S. Targett, now of Zeehan
(Tas.), and recently M.P. for Hartley, N.S.W.
Hughes is a Wesleyan and a lay-preacher, and
M‘Master is an ex-student of Mursell’s Baptist
Training College who had got too “ broad ” even
for the Baptists. The collocation of ed. and
proprietor was thus just beautiful. M'Master
would persist in chucking vitriolic criticism at
every Wesleyan sermon preached within 20 miles
of Casterton, and as everybody thereabouts who
isn’t a horse-coper is one “of the people called
Methodists,” the atmosphere of the News office—
a lean-to attached to a livery-stable—was oftener
that of Hades than the other place. Consequently,
Mac. vamoosed—and has had his revenge upon
the district in his book. Those who know
the country can spot with ease every villain and
cad in the volume—which has quite the usual
allowance.
IT RECALLS THE BLIZZARD.
In March, 1888, the great blizzard in America
almost extinguished the city of New York. The
like of it was never before seen. The snow com-
pletely stopped all local traffic. Not a horse or a
wheel could move. All the telegraph lines lead-
ing into the city were prostrated, and for two or
three days the people ot Boston and New York
communicated with each other by way of London
by means of the Atlantic cables. Thus messages
intended for three hundred miles distant were
sent six thousand miles, crossing the ocean twice.
An incident which recalls this experience to the
writer’s mind happened a short time ago here in
England. Suppose we let the gentleman in-
terested tell his own story. He says: “I have
suffered more or less from indigestion and
dyspepsia all my life. I had a bad taste in the
mouth, pain after eating, a poor appetite, and
sour stomach. My tongue was coated, and my
mouth constantly tilled with a watery fluid. No
matter what I ate, however light, it disagreed
with me and gave me pain. I had fulness of the
chest, and pain at my side, with a miserable, low,
dull feeling. From time to time I consulted a
doctor who gave me medicines, but they did very
little good. The doctor said that the coaling of
my stomach was disordered, and the mucous
membrane was inflamed. In 1877 I received a
pamphlet from New York telling of a medicine
called Mother Sergei's Curative Syrup, and of the
extraordinary cures it had effected, so 1 procured
a supply, and after taking the first I felt better,
and by the time I had taken four bottles nine, 1
was completely cured, and have been in good
health, as regards the indigestion, ever since.
Having studied the practice of herbs for many
years, I was in the habit of treating people for
erysipelas and other complaints, and was fre-
quently consulted by people in the district, so
after my remarkable cure, I was so impressed
with the merits of Seigel’s Syrup, that I procured
a large supply of the medicine, and recommended
it to all who were suffering, and people came from
far and near for it. I may mention that on a
Sunday my house was beseiged by miners from
Coal Pit Heath, and others from a distance. On
every hand I heard nothing but the loudest praise
of it and of the cures it effected, and the fame of
this medicine was spread throughout the West of
England with no other advertising than one party
tefling another of the benefit they had derived
from this wonderful medicine. I wish every one
to know of this, and if by publishing this state-
ment it will help others who may bo suffering as I
was, it will afford me pleasure.”
The letter from which the foregoing is an
extract is signed Moses Godwin, Old Sodbury
(Sodbury), Glos., and is dated April 9th, 1891.
He is a farmer.
The reader will notice that while the head-
quarters for the sale of Mother Seigel’s Syrup is
universally known to be in London, by a strange
chance Mr. Godwin’s first information concerning
it came from America, three thousand miles away,
which recalls the incident of the American blizzard
above narrated, and also shows that the fame and
usefulness of this medicine extend to all civilised
countries.
Mr. Benjamin Edgerton, grocer and provision
dealer, Plat Lane, WhixalJ, Whitchurch, Salop,
says: “While living with Mr. Roberts, Fens
Woods Farm, I first began to feel a dull, heavy
weight at my side, and noticed a bad taste in the
mouth with foul stomach and uncomfortable feel-
ing after eating. I had no appetite, and when I
sat down to the table I could not touch the food.
I had a good deal of pain and noise in the head,
and could not sleep for it. I was not fit for heavy
work, mid could only do light jobs about the
farm. After cutting a hedge I would go quite
faint, and had to sit down, and felt so much
depressed I could have 1 cried. Having always
been such a strong man I took it badly to bo
reduced to such a weak state. I took all kinds of
physic and saw a doctor, but his medicine only
eased me for a bit, and then I was worse than
before. I went on in this way for over a year,
when a servant that came to live at Mr. Roberts
told me of a medicine called Mother Seigel’s
Syrup. She had heard a gentleman talking about
it in the railway carriage, and he praised it so
much that I thought I would try it. After I had
taken two bottles fny food did me good, and I
gained strength, and by persevering with the
syrup I soon got as strong as ever, and have never
ailed anything since.”
Embezzler Larkin’s defalcations are now
set down at .£154,000-the South Melbourne
•bunding Society’s share being only £70,000. No
more is heard of his obliging friends compounding
felony with a paltry £IO,OOO.
Dear Bulletin, When is Sydney to have
her morning Protectionist paper? How much
longer are the Herald and Telegraph to be
allowed possession of the field with the
power to misrepresent and to suppress? The
Government are handicapped now in con-
sequence of this--and they, with the Protec-
tionist cause, will suffer keenly if a general
election comes along with these papers still
holding a monopoly of the morning news. What
is the Star proprietary up to ? Unless they have
some definite project in hand for bringing out a
morning paper, they are playing the dog in the
manger by refusing 1o publish any correspondence
relating to the establishment of such a paper.
Yours, &c., U. T.
The Cook town (Q.) hospital authorities
object to having incurable patients left on their
hands. A Chinaman past all remedy, who seemed
to belong to nobody, was among the inmates, so
the hospital people simply carried him out and
sat him down in the street. Sundry Christians
presently put him in a dray and took him to
Chinatown, but the yellow men there looked at
him with a hard, Lshy eye, and said “No savee.”
1 he B.M. then got two constables to carry him
back to the hospital, but the officials banged the
door upon them, 'i hen the Mayor sent a written
order for his admittance, and "the hospital once
more said no. Last of all, the law fell back on
its good, old remedy : it charged the dying cripple
with vagrancy, no visible means of support, ob-
structing a public thoroughfare, disorderly con-
duct and tearing somebody’s uniform, and now
poor John will be able to “ peg out” in limbo.
Some European fiend has patented a
contrivance by which bills can be pasted, without
the use of a ladder, to a height of fifty feet., We
trust he may be killed as a public enemy before
his horrid device reaches Australia. Every
Australian city is already plastered over with a
leprosy of bills—glaring red bills like flames stuck
on a fence, howling yellow bills like the great
plague nailed to a dead wall, blue bills, green
bills like the backs of deceased men that have gone
mouldy, murky black bills which remind one of
the shadow cast by a disused hearse, white bills,
pallid bills that seem to suffer from loss of blood,
and all sorts of bills. Moat of them arc torn to
fragments, and their remnants' hang loose and
flap disgustedly in the night air. The rain washes
the paint off them, and it drips with a melancholy
cadence and a slosh on the hat of the passer-by.
Then the bills themselves dropoff, and lie horribly
in the gutter, or fly on the wings of the southerly
buster and get into the s ye of the peaceful citizen ;
and now and then the bill-poster’s hoard ng falls
down bodily and flattens the stranger underneath.
This is how things are now, but with the advent
of the new bill-posting machine the hoarding will
grow to the height of a three-storey house, and
there will be six times as many bills on it as there
are at present, and men will come round at night
and stick hair-restorer and soap notices on the
chimneys where we can’t get at them to drag
them down, and will put slop-clothing “ads.” on
the roof, and life won’t be worth having. What
this country wants badly is a law to make it a
felony to put up a bill anywhere.
\ cars ago the chappies wore their hats on
the back of their heads —to conceal the surplus.
Now they pull them down where the forehead
should be to hide the deficiency.
You can obtain from B. Mountcastle & Sons, of
Albert-street, Brisbane, goods of a similar class to
that retailed by the leading West-end hosiers.
A very stupid cartoon in a Melbourne
weekly represented that worthy cricket-crank,
Lord Sheffield, as clearin',' but of An-lralia with a
big bag of profits, and the old gentleman was
stupid enough to feel hurt by the insinuation.
Nobody in the cricket world ima; dies that the
terms on which Lord S. lured his little picnic will
leave him with a surplus when the fun is finished,
or that he would pocket a surplus if it were there.
And as he can't be said to exist in any other
world the noble Lord needn't worry himself.

ledged by all leading and unprejudiced physicians to be
the only safe and radical cure for Nervous and Sexual
Diseases, and the thousands of testimonials received by
the Krupp Belt Co. from leading personages throughout
Australasia prove the unquestionable curative properties
of Electricity as applied by theapplianoe above referred to.

we send the Belt exit on trial, and guarantee it
to give perfect satisfaction. For full particulars as to
terms, etc., send for our large illustrated treatise, febb,
