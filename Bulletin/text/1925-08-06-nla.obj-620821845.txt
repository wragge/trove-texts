HUDSONS Eumenthol Jujubes
CAUTION. —The large sale of Eumenthol
Jujubes has led to a number of imitations
being manufactured under the name of
menthol and other jujubes. It is important,
therefore, when buying to be sure to get
HUDSON’S Eumenthol Jujubes. You may
be asked to buy other jujubes, and be told
they are “just as good’’ as Hudson’s Eumen-
thol Jujubes. This proves that these imita-
tions and substitutes have no reputation of
their own, and can only be sold on the good
repute and high character of Hudson’s
Eumehthol Jujubes.

Words and Tones
A famous pianist once confided to me that
he would rather have written Aloysius Ber-
trand’s poem “Ondine” than that deliques-
cent morceau for the piano by Maurice Ravel
which bears the same title. He went on, I
remember, to repeat the truism that poetry is
more definitive in its terms than music, and to
sketch out certain a priori comparisons and
distinctions between the potentiality of words
and that of music; thereby missing, as I
thought and still think, the proper root of
the matter. For although there is no more
familiar cliche than to say that your poet
“sings,” or to refer to the “music” or the
“melody” of his verse, it is certain that a
singing poet, or one whose creative energy
should prompt him to add to the concrete
material of his poetic work an organised
element of tones in respect of pitch, would
find himself disappointed in his search for
the public ear.
Now, I should be refuting what is common
knowledge if I said that the emotional value
of poetry may not be exactly transliterated
in musical terms; but it ought to be clear
that the functional character of the poet’s
“inspiration” is profoundly different from
that of the musician. That is to say, poetry
and music do not appeal to the same physio-
logical centres. Suppose one is listening to a
singer whose enunciation is imperfect—in
which case the words are too often made a
mere mechanism whereby the song, as
music, is given texture and color respec-
tively by the changing consonants and vowels
—one is free to accept the performance in
the state of mind in which one listens to
absolute music. Such an experience is not,
at any rate, a less agreeable one than if the
artist were singing in a strange tongue. But
if, here and there, a verbal phrase comes
clear from the singer’s lips, one’s musical
apprehension is immediately vitiated to the
extent that one’s understanding is aroused.
Or suppose, in the midst of the Kreutzer
Sonata, Kreisler’s violin should suddenly
breathe out human words, with no matter
how divine an intonation, would not the
import of the words engross the attention
to the total exclusion of the import of the
music? That it would require nothing less
than a miracle to reverse the ordinary rela-
tions of words and music—where the music
will invariably obliterate, when it does not
subsume, the sense of the words —only serves
to emphasise the original incompatibility of
the two modes of utterance.
This incompatibility is absolute. Consider
Beethoven’s amazing leap from orchestra to
voice in the Ninth Symphony. That it is
nothing less than startling, even after a hun-
dredth repetition of the work, I personally
can testify. “O Friends! No more these
tones continue”.... What apparitor from
Elysium is this? What voice of dreadful
joy? It is the voice of Beethoven himself.
With giant hands he has burst asunder the
stupendous womb of heaven. Out of that
agony of music he lifts his beloved head —-
and speaks. “Brothers!”....
Beethoven’s fond dream of writing a
“Tenth” Symphony was the first and last
infirmity of a noble mind. With the intro-
duction of that recitative he had annihilated
the symphonic form and given Wagner, inci-
dentally, an acknowledged point of departure
for his theory of Lyric Drama.
I suppose most of us have noticed that
our literary acquaintances are often indif-
ferent to absolute music, preferring the Wag-
nerian Music Drama or even the banalities
of Italian Opera to the purer forms of the
art. Wagner himself, indeed, most literary
of musicians, was never at any pains to con-
ceal a trace of irony, if not intolerance, when
discussing absolute music; and it is signifi-
cant that he never tired of insisting upon
the “poetical basis” of Beethoven’s mind. 1
know what Wagner meant (as well, that is,
as one can understand what any man means
when one is forced to read him in transla-
tion), but I think that this valuation of
Beethoven’s quality is exactly wrong. Wag-
ner made the absurd mistake we all make:
he imagined that his hero was like himself.
But, except that they were both capable of
a tremendous concentration of emphasis,
never were two composers so unlike. If we
could consider Beethoven apart from his
music-—which we cannot, since he was all
musician and nothing else —he would appear
as one to whom the world that man has built
is like a tumbled litter of child’s playthings,
which he, however, is powerless, by reason
of some inexplicable hypnosis, to sort into
order. “If I knew as much about war as I
do about music I would have settled him
long ago,” he said of Napoleon. And on an-
other occasion: “I wish I understood law as
I do counterpoint. I would soon give these
rascals their due.” By the side qf his sub-
lime conceptions in music his authenticated
personal utterances and opinions, although
often, like his music, pregnant with a tragic
heroism, resemble the naive generalisations
of some gruff Khan or sea captain whose
word is law; whose verdicts are not to be
disputed; for whom there are not two sides to
any question, spiritual or temporal. Bettine
Brentano certainly credits him (in a letter
to Goethe) with two magnificent sayings:
“I am the god Bacchus, who crushes the
grapes cf joy for mankind”: and “He who
understands my music is lifted above the
sorrows of the world.” Well, one enthusi-
astically concedes that these are the sort of
thing that Beethoven, composer of the
Seventh and Ninth Symphonies, should have
said.
But look at Wagner. Here is your “sing-
ing poet” par excellence! Having “com-
pleted” a poem—“Tannhauser,” “Siegfried”
or “Parsifal” —he sets about superimposing
upon if a polyphonic structure at whose vast-
ness and complexity Bach himself might have
gasped. (It were almost worth the pains
of learning the German language, though, to
read those poems—translations are useless
here, of course.) Naturally, Wagner was
intensely interested in the comparative values
of words and tones; and in his theory of
musical aesthetic the problem of investing the
Lyric Drama with vitality of gesture by
fusing word-speech and tone-speech into iden-
tity of form is submitted to the most search-
ing analysis. He was not content to recog-
nise that only certain kinds of poetry can
claim a psychological affinity with music; it
was the besetting obsession of his mind that
a musical equivalent could be found for any
verbal phrase whatsover. The astonishing
thing here is that, with the exception of an
occasional slight lapse in the connective
tissue of the dramas —in certain curia par-
lante passages, for example—Wagner was
able to show that his uncompromising theory
could be relied upon not to arrest the pro-
duction of the most alluring and spontaneous
music that has ever flattered the heart of man.
For whereas Beethoven seems to have shaped
his profoundest thought while in a condition
of hypnosis, as I have said, Wagner’s mind
must have been flooded at all times with
the glare of intense consciousness. Perhaps
this is why his music has, in more than one
respect, so unmistakable an affinity with
poetry. Even apart from its being avowedly
a means to an end —for with Wagner, of
course, the Lyric Drama was to be a summa-
tion of all the arts —this music attacks the
mind by stimulating those very centres which
are usually anaesthetised by music. Anyone
can put this to a test by noting the thrill
that steals through his blood-consciousness
upon entering the first wave of Wagner’s
music at the end of a programme that has so
far contained only symphonic forms. I
believe that the explanation for this is that
Wagner was, as poet and musician, accus-
tomed to work in both concrete and abstract
terms, and that he was able by some abnor-
mal process of volition to bring simulta-
neously into circuit two distinct and unrelated
groups of So that while he was
writing the poem he had —as he admits he had
—a recognisable notion of the character and
general tendency of the music which was
later to accompany it; and when he came to
write the music he must necessarily have
recaptured the identical emotional pitch of
the poem.
In the possession of this bewildering
faculty of thinking an identical thought in
two separate states of the aesthetic conscious-
ness, so that the poetical and musical ener-
gies overlap and unite to beget one definitive
and full-blooded image, Wagner stands alone.
He pays his debt to life twice over. For
whereas Swinburne’s “Tristram and Iseult”
is but a tissue of vague and tedious words,
thq Music Drama of “Tristan and Isolde”
is the most lyrical affirmation of desire in
all the world.
ADRLAN LAWLOR.
A Gospel of the Gun
British literature may be said to stand
apart from that of other peoples by reason
of its age-long concern with sport. By sport
is meant not the wearisome modern craze for
competitive games, but that pursuit of bird
and beast and fish which engaged the atten-
tion of man’s first fathers when, leaving their
fastnesses on the tree-tops, they gave up
vegetarianism and joined the ranks of the
flesh-eaters. In mediaeval Europe there were
not wanting French writers who compiled
ponderous and learned treatises on the art
and mystery of hunting the deer and the
boar, the two. beasts of the chase with which
nobility could alone concern itself. For those
of lesser degree, the very slaying of a frog
was felony. It was far otherwise in Britain.
Except for the deer, which the Norman
sovereigns reserved for themselves and their
followers, the pursuit of wild bird and beast
was permitted to the lowliest. Indeed, it
was only in our own time that the Ground
Game Act made the hare and the rabbit
private property, and forbade them to the
multitude. Small wonder that jargon
of the chase was on every man’s lips and
familiar to his ears. From Chaucer to our
own day, our poets have borrowed its
imagery and our men of letters dropped its
metaphors from their pen-points. Sport’s
appanage of literature winds back to the be-
ginning of our recorded history. Long be-
fore Dame Juliana de Berners wrote her
“Treaytyse on Huntynge, Hawkynge and
Fysshynge with an Angle,” in the fifteenth
century, there were literary Esaus who spilt
their knowledge of wild thine-s and their
ways on paper or parchment. But the Lady
Prioress of Sopwell was the first of our
sporting best-sellers, and has remained tin-
model for all who have come after her. Izaak
Walton, impaling his frog on the hook, “ten-
derly, as if he loved him”; Peter Beckford,
with his hushed and almost holy “Thoughts
on Hunting”; Colonel Hawker,, master of
his Joe Manton and the longbow; Surtees,
jesting of Jorrocks; Richard Jeffries, with
“The Amateur Poacher” and “The Game-
keeper at Home,” the master of all who have
ever essayed to put the quiet magic of English
mead and woodland, with their furred and
feathered folk, between the covers of a book;
all these and a hundred others, treading hard
on each other’s heels, have taken up the task
in turn.
The Keeper's BooJc, by Sir Peter McKie
(London, G. T. Foulis and Co.), is a very
successful modern treatise on the care, pur-
suit and capture of British game. Like
Dame Juliana’s famous work, it is a grave
and stately tome, dealing seriously with all
the important things of life which lie within
a gamekeeper’s province. Like Dame
Juliana’s “Book of St. Alban’s,” too, it has
proved intensely popular, the present edition
being the sixteenth since the original
publication 21 years ago. The compiler
is a Scottish laird whose real life
interest lies in his grouse moors and his
salmon water. Almost every section of field
sport is covered in his volume, from rabbit
and miscellaneous shooting to grouse, phea-
sant and partridge-driving. Fishing and
deer-stalking, the training and care of dogs,
and all the arts of rod and gun receive due
attention from Sir Peter and his fellow-
oontributors. Only fox-hunting is passed
over, the editor perhaps feeling, with Mr.
Jorrocks, that “ ’untin’ and shootin’ is in-
compatible.” In his introduction, Sir Peter
tells us that the book was originally com-
piled as a compleat guide to young game-
keepers and ghillies. The work has been
greatly extended in scope with succeeding

mystery of grouse and pheasant is a solemn
thing” ; but even those to whom field snoot-
ing is a sealed volume will take pleasure m
its numerous and beautiful pictures of game,
in color, and in the editor’s evident love tor
his subject. The chapter on dogs is wortn
the attention of any dog-owner. Similarly,
that on cleaning guns and rifles should be
memorised by the juvenile proprietor ot the
humblest of pea-rifles. The chapter headed
“Vermin” will appeal to the general reader.
“Vermin,” to the game-preservers eye, is
everything furred or feathered, scaled or
spined, which takes toll of his cherished
game. The writer has not the artless
artistry of Jeffries, but he is a close and
appreciative observer of wild life, irom
adders and hedgehogs to that beautiful
scourge of the grouse moors, the peregrine
falcon. Australians should find interest m
the chapter on wild-duck shooting by river
and mere, particularly at Netherby, on the
Scottish border, where the Grahams have
specialised in wild-duck preservation tor
many years. Interesting, too, is the state-
ment that wild-duck shooting, once included
under “miscellaneous,” is becoming an orga-
nised sport in some parts of England.
There is a grave chapter on tips, with a
quoted example of a haughty gamekeeper
who returned a douceur because it wasn t
“up to his standard.” Sir Peter gravely re-
probates this attitude. His views on tipping
generally will be read with approval by the
frugal. Another section deals with the mis-
cellaneous duties of a keeper, which show
that keepers must see. to much else than
poachers or grouse disease. The perfect
keeper will round off a perfect day by ‘putting
sodawater bottles in running streams tor
cooling purposes, by opening wine, beer or
whisky bottles, and laying out the contents
of the lunch basket.” There is a universal
appeal in that human touch that all may
share with the weary shooter. Indeed, that
note of tender solicitude and attention to de-
tails epitomises the work as a whole. Apait
from its intrinsic merits, the book is a curi-
ous piece of self-revelation. In it we may
see, the tireless Briton, spending endless time,
money and care on breeding, rearing and
medicining the beasts of the field and the
birds of the greenwood tree, to the end that
lie may suddenly destroy them for the
pleasure of himself and his friends.

Dulcie Deamer in the Middle Ages
The task of re-constructing a past age and
at the same time weaving a story that has a
genuine call to living people has been suc-
cessfully accomplished by only a tew wi iters
of fiction; and their genuine achievements
have been within a rather limited sphere.
Sir Walter Scott, taking full advantage ot
the enormous number of words which tne
reader of his day would tolerate, touche
six centuries in his weaving ot fiction anti
history ; yet a fair survey of the whole re-
veals the fact that the interest in Ins charac-
ters is generally least when the history is
most trustworthy. To-day he is chiefly read
for his historical color, when he is read at
all. Lord Lytton also attempted a great
many plunges into the past; but in Ins case
still more notably the men and women mov-
ing in the old scenes fail to convince. Charles
Kingsley wove a charming story round
“Hypatia,” but, in spite of the lavish color,
the people and scenes did not appear very
real. Possibly the three chief, excursions
of Conan Doyle into remote periods will be
regarded greatly in the future: for he, while
keeping to strictest historical likelihood, con-
trives to keep down his color and develop
both his characters and action on a quiet
background. In a past which was less re-
mote than that in which many of the his-
torical novelists tried to work, lhackcray
may be said to have succeeded in Esmond
and “Vanity Fair”; while very few people
would question the success of Dickens in
“The Tale of Two Cities.” Still, the fact
remains that historical fiction is in the mam
unsatisfactory, and that large spaces of time
have never been given the touch that makes
them even appear to live. Ancient Greece
has no place in the English novel; ancient
Rome has had a poor deal; ancient Egypt
is unprospcctcd country; Palestine has been
often exploited, but with little success; and
all the long period from the decay of the
ancient civilisations until the Norman Con-
quest of England is practically a virgin field
for the novelist.
A good deal of interest attaches, therefore,
to the entrance of an Australian writer into
the fascinating field of historical romance.
Dulcie Deamer selected Palestine for her
first flights, and in two moderately success-
ful books, set in the earliest days of Christi-
anity, showed an ability to reproduce much
of the light and shadow of the period. Pos-
sibly the lights were too glaring and the
shadows rather too dark, but both hooks were
made fairly convincing and both contained
passages that were strikingly powerful and
vivid. If Palestine in the first century was
not quite as she saw it, it was at any rate
impossible to bring much evidence to bear
upon any argument against her view of it.
Imagination may .iustly fill up the gaps about
which little is known; and her imagination
took full charge and painted pictures of a
country that might very well be early
Palestine.
In Tlic Devil’s Saint (Fisher, Unwin,
London) she selects an entirely new and in
every way safer field. No country is speci-
fied and no date given; but the whole of
the rapid action takes place in and around
a small walled city, which may be regarded
as typical of many in the wide period be-
tween the first Crusade and the close of the
Middle Ages. Piety, superstition, witchcraft
and dirt are all very much in evidence; and
the story develops itself from beginning to
end in a few autumnal days, while the woods
outside the walls are in yellow leaf and the
chill of coming winter is m the air. -L
passion of the young count tor , from
daughter—a mere ragged child f ~
ruffians at the roadside—is the mam theme ,
but Sidonia, the girl in question, is no ordi
ri-n-v ranged waif. Her intensity ot teeiin to
L one devote? to the Devil and protected by
him is very well handled. Count Arnold,
with his double life .and his languishing
countess, is no more incredible than much
that history has preserved as fact. i.h.
young lord is merely a headstrong boy with
plenty of force, but no discernible chaiactci-
The tale moves with speed,
event following event until the tanje be
comes complete; then a miracle ot ' •
natural kind relieves the strain, and the bat
tered central figures should be ready to b o
into hospital before taking up the
tic happiness. As the smoke and
disannear in the final deluge of ram, the
reade? 6 closes the hook with rather-mixed
fcclino-s The very young person may sneu
"rateful tears; the more hardened critic may
wonder a little what the next chapter would
be like The real fault of the book, as ot
most books of the kind, is that the'charac-
terisation is too slight to make the 8
that happen to the people of much conse
quence. The color and atmosphere are there,
lmt the actors have not enough appeal.
Sidonia burned or Sidonia lightly toaste
in the story, are matters of mdifteience. Hut
the novel is very readable, tke action is well
handled, there are passages that nse to hi n h
levels, and the work as a whole shows a
distinct advance on previous PeHomances-
All that gives a promise of something hnei
in the future.
D. M. W.
Downing of Downing-street
Modern England began in 1660, when the
Merry Monarch, amid the shouts of a great
multitude, made his way to Whitehall, l un-
tanism having laid down its sword. With
our present-day conception of
values it is hard to realise how Charles
could have maintained himself, much less
have met the demands of ,
and the rest of them, on the £1,200 006'which
Parliament voted him as his annual .income.
Out of that allowance had to be maintanied
not only his own entourage but the Navy,
the Army, the ambassadors who went to n~
abroad, the judiciary and such civil service
•is there was. The balance for cakes, ale
and huzzies could certainly not have been
magnificent. A dollar millionaire ot to-day
would have been passing rich to the monarch
who “never said a foolish thing and never
did a wise one.” In less than a dozen years
after his welcome home Charles was m
debt to the tune of two millions some odd
thousands. Financial crises were met in
those days by special levies based on monthly
assessments. As the assessors were local
men, with a delicate appreciation ot appro-
val in their districts, it was rarely tha
these sporadic assaults on property and in-
come realised the estimated yield. 1 epys
relates how in 1660 lie put £lO by for his
poll-tax. By grace of something or some-
body he was charged only f-s., and lie thought
(as Samuel would) “I am not bound to
discover myself.” Discovery (Would, have
been rather difficult at a time when invest-
ment was not understood, and all the fin a
cial machinery of to-day had yet to come
into operation. Pepys, like many otlieis of
his time, kept a large quantity of his fortune
either hidden in his house or, when the
Dutch made a raid up the Thames, buiitd
in his garden.
All revenue raised by whatsoever means
went into the King’s pot. The Government
was wholly and solely the Kings (»overn_j
ment • Ministers were responsible to him and
not to Parliament. There were no organised
parties and no collective Cabinet responsi-
bilities. Parliament, having made its grant,
washed its hands of the whole affair—it the
King couldn’t carry on with the sum granted,
lie and his Ministers might make up the
balance as best they could. Of the £1,200,000
p.a. voted only £OOO,OOO came to hand Re-
sort was had to an Ancient expedient of king*
—the raising of loans.. The custom was, if
the monarch were a bit short, to go to the
hankers, chiefly goldsmiths, and borrow .on
the security of the immediately accruing
revenue. These were short-term loans, carry-
ing a high rate of interest, and there were
many of them. And the revenue came in so
slowly that the Government had to rely
for ready money partly on letting the taxes
out to farm—the farmers paying an advance
on the farm, say, of the customs—and then
going to the bankers for the shortage. . .
In the midst of this burlesque of adminis-
tration a reformer arose —Sir George Down-
ing “It is safe to say,” writes Jolm Beresford,
in The Father of Doioning-street (Cobden
Sanderson), “that not one person in a
thousand, including students and historians,
has the slightest conception of what Down-
ing accomplished or of what he attempted
to accomplish.” To him is due the virtual
establishment of the Treasury as the first
Department of State, as we understand that
term to-day. It was he also who laid the
foundation of that constitutional reform,
appropriation of supply. In 1660, in face ot
bitter opposition from Clarendon, a
vote of £1.250.000 passed by the Commons
in aid of the Dutch war was solely appro-
priate to that specific purpose. Not a penny
of it was available for any other part of
the King’s service. The next reform was to
break down the bankers’ monopoly of loans.
The subject was one which interested, the
King naturally, and despite the opposition
of Ashley, Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Downing, with the backing of Charles him-
self, devised and carried out a scheme by
which such of the public as desired to
participate in the loan could have their
contributions, carrying 6 per cent., regis-
tered in turn by an Auditor of the Receipt
and made repayable ijn regular order.
Finally he introduced an entirely new
principle in dealing with loan P^y*
ments. Up to that date the antiquated
svstem of wooden tallies had served to
acknowledge payments and loans. This pre-
cluded any dealing in the loan money. Under
Downing’s scheme the Auditor’s warrant for
repayment of the money could be trans-
ferred on endorsement. This, in effect, was
the introduction of paper money. The citi-
zen pressed for cash could, if he held such
a warrant, anticipate the due date by an
endorsed transfer of his interest to another
person having money to invest. To a large
extent this popularised the conception ot in-
vestment. Men of that time often kept tlieir
capital accretions locked up in secret hiding-
places. The notion of investment was quite
unfamiliar to the majority of even intelli-
gent citizens. The acute Mr. Pepys saw
the advantage of the system, and invested
quite a large sum drawn from the pit m
the garden on the strength of an endorse-
ment over to him of one of these registered
orders. , , _
But the great idea at the back of Down-
ing’s head, the establishment of a National
Exchequer Bank, he did not live to see
accomplished. It was not till 20 years later
that the funding of the national debt and the
creation of the Bank of England were
brought about, twin children of the far-seeing
brain of George Downing.

A Satchel of Books
The Little Brown Baby, by Peter Blundell (John
Lane). A wildly improbable story of the swapping
of a white and a brown baby in their cradles.
The fun is labored.
Adventures by Sea from Art of Old Time, by Basil
Lubbock (The Studio, Ltd.). A fascinating folio of
old prints covering every phase—exploration, trad-
ing, whaling, privateering and plain piracy—of
Europe’s expansion overseas, with a characteristic
foreword by John Masefield.
The Viaduct Murder, by Ronald A. Knox
(Methuen). A mystery story turning on the finding
of a dead body on the railway passing through a
golf course. Written in rather better style than
the average detective yarn; otherwise there is nothing
very distinctive about it.
Billy Bluegum’s Letters, by Morland Welman
(Edwards, Dunlop). Perhaps it was the sapient
look on the face of the koala that suggested to
the Bananaland writer the assumption of a philo-
sopher in this guise. Billy Bluegum’s domestic life
is discussed in the letters, as also are Australian
politics and social interests, Christianity and the
decreasing population of Mars. Billy’s letters are
not without entertainment, but they won’t set the
bush on fire.
American Impressions, by R. D. Meagher (Gordon
and Gotch). This booklet is the outcome of a visit
paid by the writer last year. lie likes the Ameri-
cans and admires many of their institutions. Some
ho does not admire are the election of State Judges,
prohibition (“Liquor has more enemies in public
and more friends in private than anything else )
and “the vicious and undemocratic convention
system.” Readable and entertaining.
Scientific Palmistry, by Noel Jaquin (Cecil
Palmer). The author of this text-book approaches
his subject with restraint. He claims for palmistry
no gift of prophecy and strips it of the farrago at
nonsense with which it has been associated by un-
scrupulous cheiromancers. “Scientific palmistry can,
he asserts, “make possible a dissection of both the
psychological and physical being. It may care-
fully analyse character, weighing one trait against
another, and so determine which are the strong
and which the weak elements compounded in the
make-up of personality.” Of the future lie does
not pretend to tell unless so far as health or
character may be likely to operate in its determina-
tion.
“Gan”: Spencer Brodney, a Melbourne journalist
(his father, the late Maurice Brodzky, was the
founder of Table Talk), after holding good posts
on the London Daily Mail and Weekly Dispatch, is
now hidden away in the huge New York Times
building, in the “Current History” department. Always
interested in the theatre, and an enthusiastic dramatic
critic, he has now published a play of his own in
New York. It is called “Rebel Smith,” and is an
Australian political play, the setting being an out-
back pub in Queensland.
“Nob”: The class had been at work on Brown-
ing’s “Prospice,” and was invited to paraphrase the
lines: — .
“0 thou soul of my soul, I shall clasp thee again,
And with God be the rest.”
A wistful-eyed lassie came along with: “When the
poet had picked out the one he wanted, he let Goil
have the remainder.”
“A.E.Y.”: Include among magazines conducted by
Diggers on active service the O. Pip (Observation
Post). It was started by me in a dug-out, under
the noses of the 10th Battery’s guns, at Dead Mule
Corner, covering Le Sars; the concussion of the
guns frequently extinguished the editorial candle.
After the original sanctum had been blown in by a
five-nine shell, a temporary office, in the shape o, sheets
of iron, wiyi carried after the retreating Hun, and
transferred into No Man’s Land when the editor was
on forward observation duty. A London firm
published the first edition, with color illustrations,
at the equivalent of three francs each subscribed in
advance. The second edition was just ready to send
to the printers and the money had been subscribed
when the brass-hats, disapproving of some remarks
in the first number about the meanness of a Q.M.b.
with rations, ruled that the O. Pip must be discontinued.
The difficulty arose in returning the subscribers their
money. I was evacuated at this stage, and left the
job to a gunner. When he was wounded he entrusted
the funds to the forward observation officer, who
went west the same night at Hill 60 Eventu-
ally we got* the money back from the estate of th
0.0., but as most of the subscribers had been knocked
by this time we voted the bulk of it to canteen
“F J B ” • Australians should be grateful to Chestei-
ton for giving Wagga Wagga a niche England s
annals. He writes, in “A Short History of England .
“I fully accept the truth in Mr. Kipling’s question
of ‘What can they know of England who only Eng
know?’ and merely differ from the view that the*
will best broaden their minds by the Etu< fr ° f
Wagga Wagga and Timbuctoo.” It was no doub ,
reminiscence of the Tichborne affair that sugg sted
to Chesterton Wagga Wagga as the Ultima ilmle o
Empire. But no matter, Australia is becomingly
grateful: though the linking up of a White Aus
tralian town with treacle-colored Timbuctoo is no
to be put up with.
“CM.”- Sydney booksellers say they supply more
early Australiana to American and English clients
than they do to local collectors. Still, we manage
to get a good catch now and then. _ Sydney Museum
is just now crowing over the arrival oi owe
paintings made on the second voyage of the Lndeavoui
by George Forster, the naturalist painter. On the
first voyage the four artists accompanying Sir Joseph
Banks died. On the second, Forster (whose Mhe
was naturalist, succeeding Banks) had as lain »ca|»
and general artist W. Hodges. Returning home
Forster sen., fell out with the Government, and, i
would seem, dispersed privately all the paintings o
the trip, apart from some duplicate drawings o
birds by his son, which Banks bought and presented
to the British Museum. The originals of the.,
together with many others by young Eorstea- and
Hodges, have now been acquired by che > >.
Museum. They include paintingc of many biid-
till then never seen by Europeans, such as
Antarctic petrel, the sooty albatross and the snow '
petrel One other item of Australiana that should
be snapped up for us, if ever the opportunity occurs,
is the original Pitcairn Island Register, which the
mutineer John Adams compiled.

A Mood.
I'll never go adventuring. I know
I hold the wealth of Jason’s argosies;
I know the laughter of the wide blue waves
And all the perfect peril of the seas.
I’ll never go adventuring. I’ve seen
The blood on Trojan pavements, and the
spear
With Hector’s heart upon it, like a rose.
And Helen’s passionate, wild face of fear!
I’ll never go adventuring. My bliss
Is here beneath the high enamelled sky,
Your shoulder touching mine, and your strong
kiss
Pressed hard upon my mouth as here we
lie.
I'll never go adventuring. No trail
Of silver like the trappings of a star
Shall lure me out, who hold in my two arms
The essence of all marvellous things that
are.

The Headland at Waitati.
Tlie headland at Waitati
Runs laughing to the sea
As it has run the cycling years since ever
time might be;
Since ever time has been, my dear, as long
as time will be,
A thousand years before we kissed, our bare
feet in the grasses
Dew-wet and flower-trailed as when Sep-
tember passes.
Oh, brave it is and green it is, and spread
entrancingly,
With fleecy clouds above it while the sea goes
whisperingly!
Oh, sunlit or moonlit or in the dawning glory
It’s I must sing its magic in royal chant and
story!
Your face and ways are blurred, my girl;
its arabesques of clover
Are purpled with my heartsblood, though
Time’s made of me a rover.
The kiss I took, the kiss you gave, upon our
mouths the morning
Was given not for love, my dear, nor yet in
idle scorning:
It was a thing of beauty born of us and
given free
To the headland of Waitati that runs
laughing to the sea —
Our cool hands and our cold lips fresh from
the waves embracing,
And the lupins and the heady gorse a gold
track homeward tracing!
When you and I shall sleep, my dear, beneath
our brown earth-cover,
Will you forgive, I wonder, then, that I
fell short the lover?
And will you smile to think our joy (although
your tears came after)
Oave to our trysting-place, maybe, a rim of
bluebell laughter?
For me I know that I shall sing, • though
Time’s made me a rover,
Its winds, its good green mantle and its
arabesque of clover!

Ghosts.
There is no song in all the world
Like the music of the rain,
When every twig is freshly pearled
Beneath black harps of cloud unfurled,
When strings of crystal chain
Are tuned where spider-webs have crossed
The little haunted pathways lost —
To meet —and part again.
In a cold cadence purely clear
From leaf to leaf there fall
Notes of a melody austere
Not played for any living ear;
And shining to the call
Come presences who, hand in hand,
Pass on the paths of silver sand
And leave no print at all.
While shivering oldsters hug the fire.
The tracks young joys have traced
In lovely days when shy desire
Has dreamt not it could ever tire
Are rain and song enlaced.
And to the water music light
Their faintly shimmering floors all night
By phantom feet are paced.
For when the earliest rose of day
Reddens the tea-trees wet,
These narrow paths that wind and stray
For ever by the salt-sea spray
Smell sweet as mignonette,
Brushed by the wings, the flowered dress
Of many a bygone happiness
That died before regret.

< ‘old grows the night; the wind is cold that
shakes the bare, brown tree;
Cold is the drifting rain, and cold—ah, cold!
—the heart of me,
For on this night the fishing fleet takes out
my man to sea.
There is a glamor on the day, a warm wind
stirs the tree *
The birds sing loud, but not so loud as does
the heart of me.
For on this day the fishing fleet brings home
my man from sea.
The sunlight sparkles on the waves, the birds
sing in the tree;
But, oh, there is a bitter cold within the heart
of me.
For when the fishing fleet came home they
left my man at sea.

INQUISITIONS, RELIGIOUS,
POLITICAL AND INDUSTRIAL.
Inquisitions of a feeble and transitory sort
go back as far as the days when Theodosius
ran the imperial show, but the Church, con-
trary to common opinion, made no great
success of them. For a long while
they lacked organisation and staying
power. The Inquisition, which remained and
made history, and was the father of a large
family, was that organised by Ferdinand
of Aragon and his wife Isabella, the blue-
eyed saint of Gastille. The idea was to unify
Spain and make it a fighting machine—a
nation which should be “all sting,” as
Sparta was once and Prussia later. Seven
centuries of hustle with invading Moors and
Berbers had made well-meaning people ready
to sacrifice a great deal for unity. The penin-
sula was divided into three kingdoms, one of
them Mohammedan, but in parts of Spain
there were amateur kingdoms in which noble
but rowdv families ran a cheerful chaos and
chronic civil war of their own. Its popula-
tion was divided into three sects, Jews and
Mohammedans having a tendency to gravi-
tate together because of their common mono-
theism. A casual Pope gave authority for
the formation of a steam-roller tribunal
which was to flatten out the religious and
other discrepancies which stood in the way
of union. When he tried, in terror, to recall
the authority, the steam-roller slipped out
of the Papacy's control. The power at Rome
even lost the appointment of inquisitors, and
the holy apparatus, as much political as
pious, was made to serve political purposes
which often didn’t fit in with the interests
of the Pope as a temporal sovereign of the
minor sort. It brought no one much luck.
The first queen of the new and united Spain
was mad, insanitary, a good deal of a here-
tic, and was kept shut up in a castle for 47
years, which was annoyin? for all parties
concerned. The first king was orthodox and
a fairly efficient persecutor, but his orthodoxy
didn’t prevent him sacking Rome as it had
never been sacked before, and putting the
Pope in prison. The .second king was an in-
ferior soldier and a poor sailor, a frequent
husband and the father of many dead child-
ren. In his day the army lost its invinci-
bility, the glory departed suddenly, and the
country started for that intellectual and in-
dustrial back seat among European nations
which it long shared with Russia and Turkey,
and possibly shares with them still. As for
the Inquisition, it gradually became shabby
and enfeebled, and a brooding incubus in
frowsy clothes, till it flickered out. There
never was another Inquisition built on a
really imposing scale until one started a few
years ago in Russia, and its career at home
and its missionary enterprise abroad are
being watched with interest.
* rr vfr
The Soviet constitution was rccentlv re-
vised, which meant, of course, that the Inqui-
sition or nersecuting department of the State
was overhauled and put in order. No one
professes now that intolerance and terrorism
are temporary or war measures. They have
come to stay for as long as the system lasts.
The amended constitution, like its raw pre-
decessor, has for its ostensible object the
“dictatorship of the proletariat,” which is
“exercised through” the Union Council of
People’s Commissaries and other appliances.
Even Spain never wholly lost the name or
pretence of representative institutions, and
even in their deepest decline they exercised
any dictatorship that was allowed them, do-
ing so through the Sovereign, or the Holy
Office, or any other power which was suffici-
ently obliging to permit itself to be used for
the purpose. The crushing or rigid holding
down of the “bourgeoisie” is still provided
for in the Moscow creed, the bourgeois being
a species of heretic who was born to heresy,
and can’t get out of it, no matter how hard
he apostasises. He is a person who, at the
date of the revolution, wasn’t doing hard and
unintellectual work with his hands or feet,
or is the son of such a person, or is an indi-
vidual who has shown signs of drifting into
a state of intellectual expansion since, and
has been declared such a person. He has no
vote, and is not trusted with arms even in
that land of military compulsion, though he
may bo employed on odd jobs about the
camp. It has been found necessary to
tolerate employers of labor to some extent
in order to keep the wheels of industry
going round, but the employer is “bour-
geois,” and has no vote or Parliamentary
representation. This, however, doesn’t
apply strictly to a peasant who hires a sub-
ordinate peasant, the peasant class being
hard to deal with and not suspected of in-
tellectual progress. The repaired constitu-
tion is as decisive as its predecessor against
meetings and the formation of clubs, it being
doubtless recognised that people would hardly
take the trouble of meeting to tell one an-
other how much they admired the Soviet,
and any other exchange of views might be
the beginning of mischief. Printing remains
a Government monopoly, for all Inquisitions
are shy of promiscuous knowledge. A large
execution of ex-students, who were at college
in the last imperial days and have been under
suspicion eVer since, was recently reported,
the Inquisition being shy of people who
possess knowledge as well as of those who
print it, and having a very efficient police
system to smell out disaffection. All that is
required of a citizen in these parts is abso-
lute obedience to the system, whole-souled
admiration for it, and complete faith in its
infallibility. Within these limits he can
think and act as he pleases. (For instance,
atheism isn’t absolutely insisted on.) When
an Inquisition is young and fresh it is apt
to perform in an extraordinary fashion.
* « * *
The Australian Inquisition is being built
piecemeal, and it awaits the advent of a
Federal Government of the real Communist
brand to put the isolated fragments into one
harmonious whole. Tne present Govern-
ment is a rather pale imitation of the one
which Louis XVI. ran in France during an-
other exciting period (and Louis’s was no
high-colored affair), but though it has given
a great deal of passive aid it hasn’t
been a strenuous working partisan of
revolutionary movements. Much Com-
munistic law has been made, but the
proper Bolshevik code is still wanting. It
is being laid down more and more definitely
that no Australian has a right to work unless
he belongs to a union, and that the right can
be taken away if he refuses prompt obedience
when ordered to break the law; or if he fails
to pay a fine, large or small, imposed without
trial by jury, and in fact without formal trial
of any sort; or if he is charged with too much
industry ; or if his politics are supposed to be
of the wrong color; or if sheer poverty makes
him “unfinancial.” In the absence of any-
thing more definite his subscription may be
refused because of “conduct prejudicial to
the best interests of unionism.” This puts
him in the “bourgeois” class, as the Moscow
expression goes. He lives under surveillance.
There exists an almost general rule that no
Australian employee shall do more than the
minimum of work, measured by time; that in
consequence he shall earn the minimum of
pay, and that lie shall take no visible interest
in his work and be dissatisfied with his pay.
The last is easy. One of the early complaints
handed in to the present N.S.W. Government
was to the effect that piecework was not
wholly extinpt even now, and that some
capable men made £2O per week at it. It was
probably an exaggeration, but the Ministry
was called upon to abolish high wages imme-
diately. The law of the growing Inquisition
is that there shall be no hope or prospect
before the “worker” except by going into
Labor politics, the first step being to leave
off labor and acquire a union secretaryship
and a seat on the A.L.P. It is a sign of how
completely unimportant the plain worker
has become that 12 names were recently pub-
fished of anticipated Labor appointees to the
N.S.W. Upper House, and every one was
described as secretary, president, ex-presi-
dent, or something of the sort. If there was
one real worker in the crowd the fact was
concealed. The more noisy and less tactful
species of Communist leader —the one who is
a bundle of venom, ignorance, bigotry and
superstition—openly demands the closing of
universities as “capitalistic institutions.” Aus-
tralian universities give evening instruction
to ambitious and industrious youths who wish
to go beyond the point where the State-school
left them. The Communistic system con-
siders instruction dangerous except the kind
that is supplied through the Moscow Govern-
ment press. It has no use for ambition ex-
cept the ambition to enter Communist poli-
tics, and it regards industry, beyond the ex-
treme maximum of the 44-hours week, as
anathema. Altogether the local Inquisition
apparatus is being put together with a cer-
tain amount of skill and plenty of energy. It
is still a piecemeal structure which a strong
breath could blow away, and the same applied
to Bolshevism when Lenin and Trotsky
were unsuccessful revolutionists and outlaws,
whose places of concealment were perfectly
well known. But President Kerensky
wasn’t a hard-breathing man, and so far the
mild character who fills the corresponding
position in Australia hasn’t shown himself
one either.
*** * *
. Even Inquisitions have their points of
difference. The one run by Thomas Tob-
quemada promised its subjects Heaven, and
did so in perfect good faith. The Trotsky
and Walsh variety doesn’t even promise Plell
to its humble followers. But the Trotsky
Inquisition, being based on Communism, stole
the “worker’s” house and furniture (“nation-
alised” them, in fact), and the Australian
imitation plans to do likewise. Whatever
might be Torquemada’s failings he was
above petty larceny.
THE FORBIDDEN SUBJECT.
Written on the morning after:—
The tumult and the shouting having died and the
captains and the ginks departed, it is meet that
Sydney and Melbourne should look at themselves in
the bottom of the glass and report honestly what they
see there. It cannot be said that Sydney has any-
thing to boast about concerning her manner of enter-
taining her visitors; . Melbourne’s record is rather
better. For one gold-braided person who was whisked
about the N.S.W. countryside in limousines a hun-
dred gobs were flung defenceless on the fixed bayonets
of hotel bars. The half-doors of dingy pubs flapped
as they had never flapped before, admitting the inno-
cents and their seasoned cobbers and ejecting the
temporarily incapacitated on to the pavement. No
other steps that affected more than a small minority
were taken to entertain our guests, although they
were a pleasant-faced assemblage and showed a pre-
dilection for innocent amusement. The weather, as
usual, treated Sydney well, and a few men wandered
down to the Gardens and stared at the Harbor; but
there were no open-air cafes where the light wines of
the country might have been drunk in comfort and
with ordinary decorum, and there were far too many
seedy pubs, and -wineshops and even less reputable
haunts. From the latter no statistics are available,
but in this case statistics are unnecessary.
I took the trouble to question a nice boy from
Massachusetts, an infant from Michigan and sundry
other inhabitants of the floating towmhips to ascertain
if Uncle Sam had as progressive ideas about the
social evil as he has about depth charges. The
answers of the youngsters confirmed my suspicion
that uplift is as rampant in the American navy as it
is in the British. There was a brief period about 15
years ago in the history of J. Bull’s fleet when com-
monsense threatened to triumph over obscurantism,
but the crisis passed. Before the war the wastage
due to the strange diseases that are not talked about
in drawing-rooms was consequently frightful.
An example of which I -was privileged to have a
close-up view occurred in Borneo. A small unit
of his Britannic Majesty’s sea armament was de-
tailed to special work for several years in that tropi-
cal paradise. The chaplain was a worthy man, but
he blushed too readily, and the lectures on personal
hygiene which were supposed to be given to the un-
sophisticated tars were allowed to lapse. Not that
they would have had any influence on the mass, but
they might have saved an odd poor devil or two.
The ship went for three months every year to Hong-
kong for a clean-up, and while she was being made
fit for further service in the dock her complement
were being made unfit for further service in the
town. On her return to her station, laden with a
quantity of fresh complaints, the temperature of the
little settlement on which she was quartered in-
variably rose, but the only occasion on which the shore
authorities saw fit to propose that she should go into
quarantine was when she came back with a mild
epidemic of measles, or something of the sort, in her
fo’c’s’le, as well as all the other things.
I met one of her men—a gunner and a good one,
too—in Sydney later. He had been discharged for
the crime of syphilis and wanted to get into the
N.S.W. police force; but as his misdemeanor was
entered on his discharge I doubt if he succeeded.
“In Java there are poisonous girls,” wrote a
Chinese tourist of the fourth century, doubtless
speaking from sad personal experience. The obser-
vation still holds good for those parts and provides
me with another horrible example. Once upon a
time Singapore had a sort of unofficial yoshiwara,
the world-famous Malay-street, which was exclusively
reserved for Europeans and was popularly considered
to be reasonably clean. The dwellers in the quarter
depended for their patronage upon their reputation
as in any other business, and, as competition was
extraordinarily keen, the results, though far from
perfect, were better than they would have been under
no control at all. When the war broke out the
uplifters got an opportunity to do the same thing
with the army as they had done with the navy;
and Malay-street was metaphorically scattered to
the winds. The mantle of a seeming virtue enveloped
Singapore, and she has remained enveloped ever since.
The latest official report indicates, however, that little
is altered underneath the shroud, and what is is
altered for the worse; while it is common talk
amongst respectable natives that even a Chinese
coolie would not have the courage to patronise the
houses favored by white fledglings of European busi-
ness firms.
The attitude of Uncle Sam to his tender charges,
according to the child from Massachusetts, seems to
be much the same. The hordes of men who have
been loosed upon the various ports during the
present cruise have had a little instruction and
warning given them, and prophylactics are obtain-
able, and the name of the person who applies is
carefully entered in a register; but the notion still
persists that the unfortunate who falls a victim to
any of the scourges rampant in society ought to be
punished for it, and, as he loses his pay while
he is in hospital, he is tempted to conceal the
evidence of his sin. While this attitude remains
piacticaih universal, the large-scale exchange of
international courtesies will always be liable to be
attended by a hidden but unpleasant aftermath.
There is one country which is showing the rest
a lead, and her progress in the matter should be
watched with interest. Belgium after the war
made the uncomfortable discovery that while 10
pm cent, of the population in the capital wa-
syphilitic, the condition amongst the peasantry ws,
just as back Seventy thousand victims in a single citv
of an infection that pays no reparations and observes
no armistice struck Belgium as a serious concern,
especially since it was known that a long list of
other complaints was fathered by the scourge,
including 25 peculiar to children. The first line of
defen e the little country that put up the good fight
in 1914 proposes to erect is the rigid examination of
emigrants. The next is a strong measure of
internal control, which includes free and systematic
issue of prophylactic medicines and compulsory steri-
lisation of infectious persons. Last year 17,00*0
patients were sterilised, and the incidence of fresh
cases of infection has dropped from 85 to 20 per
cent.
Australia is in a far better position to' carry out
an ambitious programme of this nature than is
Belgium. Having no frontiers but the sea she could
prevent the smuggling of the contagion far more
easily than the smuggling of opium. And while
damming the stream of fresh infection she could set
about trying to stamp the old fires out. By 1942
the blessings of immunity would be so manifest that
no discourtesy would be intended or should be felt if
she demanded of the visiting squadron of a friendly
nation a mean .nil of health on each and every
count.
BOGUS DESERTS AND REAL ONES.
The United States Admiral Coontz, whose
name is somehow faintly reminiscent of the
onee-famous Ahkoond of Swat, became per-
pendicular on his two feet in Melbourne
lately with the old and hackneyed oration
about how there was once a Great American
Desert. This sort of thing naturally leads to
the story of how United States genius con-
quered the apparently impossible obstacle,
with some gentle encouragement to Austra-
lians to go forth manfully and do like Uncle.
Then the Old Age, or the Natural Decay,
or the Morning Rooster, or all of them
take up the parable, and the result is a dusty
outpouring after this fashion
It will pay Australians to read and re-read Admiral
speech, for some of them need to acquire
its spirit.... Those of more extended vision, with
clearer minds and stouter hearts, attempt and con-
quer, setting examples to their fellows and making
a nation. “At one time,” observed the Admiral,
“everything in the United States west of the Missis-
sippi was marked on the map, ‘Great American
Desert.’ ” The maps of Australia, and the thoughts
they suggest, show that America’s public opinion of
that time resembled closely public opinion in this
country now. Admiral Coontz reminded us of the
rapidity with which the American desert has shrunk
and shrunk, until very soon it will have entirely dis-
appeared. He prophesied that within a relatively
few. years—very few in the life of a people—Aus-
tralia’s desert would be conquered by homes and
industries in the same way. “1 do not believe,” said
the Admiral, “that you people down here realise
what a wonderful country and future you have
ahead of you. It takes an outsider to look ahead and
see what is going to happen.”.... Within the
memory of men who are still among our most vigorous
workers great parts of Australia have changed
from nominal desert into cornfields and orchards.
... .Admiral Coontz’s notable speech will help Aus-
tralians to think continentally.
All that turgid gulf leads up to no proposi-
tion to do anything definite for Australia.
And the remarks about “extended vision,”
and “stouter hearts,” and those who “attempt
and conquer,” also about “making a nation,”
are out of place. The paper which publishes
them is the same narrow and short-visioned
concern which greets with yells of “desert
railway” every proposal to provide the heart
of this continent with the first essential of
progress—a transcontinental line. It holds,
when it becomes a matter of concrete in-
stances, that there is no future, and that
nothing will pay, unless the public money is
invested in its own immediate radius. It
dwells in a corner and thinks cornerwise—
not continentally.
The rich and widely disrespected Josiah
Bounderby began life with many of the
blessings of Providence, but he craved to be
a self-made man. So he composed for him-
self a desert childhood, with a ditch for a
birthplace, an egg-box for a cradle, an ab-
sconding mother and a drunken grandmother,
and got much satisfaction therefrom. The
United States west of the Mississippi also
began life not at all penniless, and set up a
tradition. I have never managed to trace
those maps on which everything between the
big river and the sunset was marked
“desert.” I never found anybody who had
met them. If the term was used I expect it
was in the same sense as when applied to
Crusoe’s isle, that being another place where
decent white society was scarce. But if some
ignorant person really marked an American
desert which wasn’t there, and some well-
informed persons marked African and Ara-
bian and Australian deserts which were there
and still remain there, one fact proves no
more than the other. The early legends of
west-of-Mississippi have been much exploited,
like the legends of the Rhine. They dealt
largely with bison in countless herds—mil-
lions and billions and milliards and billiards
of bison, and with grass which grew so tall
that in places it obscured the bison, and
countless Indians on countless horses who
ran after the bison, and occasionally fired
the grass when it dried in autumn, in order
to annoy paleface ' travellers. Tales of this
variety don’t grow up in genuine African or
Arabian deseyts, or any other dinkum desen.
either. Uncle Sam’s great West has been
tamed to some extent by the simple process
of sending people there when there wera
spare people to send. Private enterprise
built railways all over the shop. And a cer-
tain amount of irrigation has been done, one
reason being that river-water is available to
irrigate with. Contrary_ to town-bred, and
possibly sea-faring, delusion, very little irri-
gation is done with deep artesian water,
which has a frequent tendency to _ kill vego-
tablcs, and sometimes to slay animals and
eat into boilers. Australians probably know,
by necessity, as much about deep-sinking as
all Yankees, living and dead (by a recent
count Queensland alone had 218 bores vary-
ing in depth from 3000 ft. to 7009 ft.), so they
speak with authority, and not through tlieir
Eight States of Uncle Sam’s Union are
commonly regarded as short ot ram


Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah,
Nevada, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.
Colorado constitutes about the heart- —the
dead heart —of the group, and this (from
a cyclopaedia) is how they do the desert busi-
ness in these parts:—
The Colorado River is formed by the union of the
Grand and Green rivers. The Green River rises in
Wyoming, and drains the south-west portion of that
State. It also receives affluents from Utah and the
north-west angle of the State of Colorado. The
Grand River rises in Colorado, where its more
common name is the Gunnison. Its main tributaries
in that State are the Bunkara and the Dolores.
Below the junction of the Green and Grand
rivers the main affluent in Utah is the San Juan,
which drains an interesting region in the south-west
of Colorado and the north-west of New Mexico. In
Arizona the main affluents are the Colorado Chiquita,
the Bill Williams and the Rio Gila, all from the
left. The only important affluent the Colorado
receives from the right is the Rio Virgen.... The
whole course of the river below the junction is
about 900 miles. To its remotest sources it is
2000 miles. Navigation is possible for light-draught
steamers for over 600 miles Its waters are
largely employed in southern Arizona for irrigation
purposes.
It may be added that the elevation of the
State which gives its name to this asset
varies from itUOOft. to 14,500 ft., so
that there is little loss of the rain-
fall and snowfall by evaporation, and that
the output of mineral wealth equals that
of all Australia. Other States in this dry
heart of the Republic also specialise a good
deal in rivers, lakes and mountains, and the
way they throw navigable streams about to
each other is startling to an Australian. No
doubt it was a creditable act on Nunkey's
part when he rescued this region from the
disgrace and slur of being “desert” on the
map, and “conquered it by homes and indus-
tries,” though an average population of less
than four per square mile isn't so very much
conquest considering the time he has been
at the job. Nevada, which is more like a
second-grade part of this country than its
seven neighbors, had only seven-tenths of a
human being per square mile in 1920, and
was on the downward track to boot.
The fact, as it appears to me, is that
Uncle never had enough real desert to blow
about, and hasn’t reclaimed much of what
lie had. He never attempted to irrigate with
rivers like the Thompson or the Cooper,
which have a tendency to dry rip on their
way to Lake Eyre, and to find it dry when
they arrive, which they mostly don’t. Maybe
he would die of alarm, aggravated by chew-
ing-gum, if lie met such a problem. And
what our starred-and-striped relative did in
his dry areas has been largely in the way
of manufacturing (thanks to a splendid
tariff) and, as already remarked, in mining,
also in private railway-building. So it might
be well not to take over much stock in the
clarion call of Coontz, who really hasn’t
seen this country, or of Stefansson, who
didn’t see much of it, but to get to work on
something practical. Australia could have
railways from south to north, provided the
Governments, which are apparently unable
to do anything themselves, would let someone
else do something. The money for a laud-
grant line from Port Augusta to Darwin was
ob offer when the S.A. Ministry decided to
make its wretched bargain with the Common-
wealth instead. So was the money for a
line from Brisbane to the Gulf, when
Samuel Griffith saw his chance to
dish Mcllwraith by turning against the
proposal. Westralia built two big early rail-
ways on the land-grant system. The inves-
tors made little profit, and, in fact, one
company is still waiting for its first dividend,
but the country reckoned them convenient.
Settlers could be found in plenty for the
North if it was made easily accessible by
any old device and cheap land was put on
sale. In fact, the Australian could pro-
bably do better with inferior materials, pro-
vided he shook himself free from the creep-
ing paralysis of the political machine, than
liis_ American Prohibition relative did with
considerable stretches of the deserts which
exist almost wholly in his imagination. The
Australian really knows something about
deserts.
SOLOMONMALAPROP.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
An Uneasy Sitter on Two Stools.
The daily deliverance to the capitalistic
press of a brawling preachment on current
questions has become a fixed habit Avith N. S.
Wales Premier Lang, and it isn’t a desirable
habit. A patch of golden silence would be
a blessed relief. There is generally a note
of self-exculpation in the deliverance, which
makes it read like the Avork of an ill-tempered
man with a conscience Avliich sits by his bed-
side at night. This Avas especially conspicu-
Avhen he set out to explain away the
I.W.W. on a recent day. That notorious
and criminal organisation of foreign origin
decided that with Lang’s accession to power
the time had arrived to emerge from retire-
ment and resume its propaganda. Where-
fore the Premier denounced it with feeble
fury, and said it Avas his duty “as head of
the Government to repudiate at once all con-
nection, political and industrial, with these
disturbers of public order and political pro-
gress.’’ lie included in the denunciation
"Mr. Garden and his Moscow friends,” who
have taken the I.W.W. to their bosoms. At
the same time he saAv, of course, that the
I.W.W. was Avorking in the opposition in-
terest and spoke firmly :
The I.W.W. is essentially hostile to the Labor
movement. Its aims are repugnant to all sane and
responsible wage-earners, and it seems to me that
jt now shows its ugly and disreputable head simply
to try and injure the chances of the Labor party at
the coming Federal election. The miserable weakness
of the Communist party Avas well demonstrated at the
late election, so it is now thought that a revival of
'W.-ism may act as a bolt in Labor’s machinery.
1 don’t think that N.S.AV. should be made a dumping-
ground for the refuse of the British Empire. More
care should be taken by the Federal authorities in
the admission of undesirables.
As if these weren’t sufficient mistakes to put
into one sermon, the Premier said that his
Government vvasn’t going to “allow crimin-
ality to flourish in our midst, whether it
masquerades under the name of I.W.W. or
any other,” which put the brand of crime on
the foreign-born organisation for all to see.
Aow a few years ago the I.W.W. was very
busy burning down Sydney, and sundry of
the push were convicted and gaoled. The
Communists inside the Labor party de-
manded their release. All Communists are
inside except those who choose to advertise
themselves, for reasons of their own, by mem-
bership of a Communist organisation. The
demand for release might, or might not, have
been numerous, but it was loud enough to
impress the Labor leaders, and it became
merely a question whether, if Lang’s friends
got into office, the I.W.W. should be released
whether guilty or not, or whether it should
be whitewashed first and then set free. The
Labor Government chose the latter course.
It was a precarious friend, having no majo-
rity save Speaker Levy, and the I.W.W.
people didn’t embarrass it during its brief
career by shouting their criminal purposes
and total lack of repentance on the house-
tops. Nor did they advertise much during
the Fuller period, the atmosphere being un-
sympathetic. But now that Labor is back
with a real majority a reappearance Avas
due. Dogged by the Red Objective and
ordered round by the Red Objectionables,
Lang almost certainly doesn’t know whether
he hangs on to the thread of political exist-
ence by grace of the Communists or not.
So he utters windy diatribes against them,
and when they start a ruinous hold-up of
industry in his own city he does nothing to
hinder them. His attitude is that the Fed-
eral authorities should be more strict in
shutting out undesirables, whom it should
recognise by infallible process, e\’en in in-
fancy, but any proposal to send them home
again when they prove undesirables excites
bis strenuous opposition. Logically, if an
immigrant who proves undesirable after
admission shouldn’t be punished by expul-
sion he shouldn’t be punished by imprison-
ment either. The argument that more care
should have been taken about his admission
in the first place holds as good one way as
the other. It even holds goods in the case
of a house-agent who wants to expel a non-
paying and destructive tenant. As he didn’t
recognise the tenant’s bad qualities at the
beginning he should put up with the incubus
for life, even if he has to pay the rent out
of his own pocket.

Queensland Railways and Politicians.
The big Gympie (Q.) railway accident was
the sort of event that might, by adverse cir-
cumstances, happen on the best-managed
system, but evidence piles up to declare that
it happened because Queensland’s was among
the worst-managed. As the testimony
drizzles in, with long intervals between, it is
marvellous how many persons seem to have
been aware for quite a while that the stretch
of line involved Avas in a state of dilapida-
tion. and didn’t consider it so unlike other
stretches as to get unduly excited on the
subject. Even a policeman is said to have
noticed something amiss. New men are evi-
dently Avanted, but the old crowd can’t pro-
duce them without departing from its funda-
mental principle that the right man for Par-
liament and for office is the one who has be-
gun by making the biggest splash in his own
Labor circle to begin with. There is still an
agitation to diddle South Australia out of
the South,-to-North railway, and instead to
make a Federal railway through Western
Queensland to the Territory, joining up with
a number of Queensland lines in passing, and
taking them into the system. This brilliant
project has suffered something of a setback.
A State railway system which was subsidised
in 1924 to the extent of £1,412,900 out of
the taxes, and had been similarly subsidised
for eight years, and yet couldn’t keep itself
in any better repair than described, doesn’t
seem a desirable partner in any Federal ven-
ture. The situation of ex-Premier Theo-
dore is a curious one these days. He sacri-
ficed office and descended to the humble
status of a private member before the rail-
way revelations came along, which was acci-
dental. He got out of office before the 44-
hours week began to make big trouble, which
wasn’t accidental. The ostensible reason of
his retirement was that he proposed becoming
a Federal candidate in about a year’s time,
Avhich looked like breathless haste. What-
ever the Queensland railways are they be-
came under his long period of control. It
was possibly by Avay of disclaiming responsi-
bility and cutting loose from old accomplices
that he took a cross-bench seat on the day
Parliament opened, but the situation he left
behind him requires a lot of disclaiming.
Exactly to what extent his star is fading in
semi-obscurity it is hard to say. Should he
think it necessary to keep in the limelight
by becoming a candid critic of his successor’s
doings the situation will be strained.

Naval Imitation and its Limitations.
A notable feature of the Japanese naval-
building programme is the large number of
light-cruisers for which it provides. By
1929 Japan will possess 25 modern vessels
of this type (i.e., ships less than 10 years
old), and at least four Avill be 10,000-tonners,
armed with eight or nine Sin. guns. This
programme in no way exceeds the limit of
construction imposed on Japan at the Wash-
ington Conference, and keen students of in-
ternational naval affair-s are surprised that
it is not more ambitious. The general effi-
ciency, so far as it goes, of the Japanese
Navy cannot be denied, but in the post-
war struggle for naval supremacy there are
serious obstacles to be overcome before Japan
can hope to assume the lead. Some of
them are detailed :
The small stature and poor physique of the
Japanese sailor handicap the Japanese naval con-
structor from the jump. AVhereas British battleships
for the past 20 years have carried 6-in. guns, firing a
1001 b. shell, as their secondary armament, the latest
Japanese battleships Mutsu and Nagato mount only
5.5-inch guns, firing an 801 b. shell. The Japanese
sailor man-handling his 801 b. projectile cannot load
his weapon as rapidly as the British sailor humping
his 1001 b. one.
The Japanese are good imitators but poor inven-
tors. The Hawkins class of light cruiser, displacing
nearly 10,000 tons and carrying seven 7.5-inch guns,
has been in commission in the British Navy for five
years, yet the Japanese will not have completed a
cruiser of similar power until next year. Their
naval construction is always two or three years
“astern of station,” for the reason that they have to
rely on other nations to supply them with new de-
signs. By exercising a little patience and using
their eyes they can eventually discover what Britain
and America are doing in the matter of new construc-
tion, and in a year or two they can, and do, turn
out fairly faithful imitations. But these imitations,
in the nature of things, are a little obsolete by the
time they join the Imperial fleet.
Unaided, the Japanese cannot master the technical
improvements and developments constantly being in-
troduced by the British and the Americans. Since
the war immense advances have been made in gun-
nery control, communications and fleet organisation.
And far greater secrecy is maintained in these days
over the details of the latest torpedo or the intrica-
cies of a new hydrophone than was ever the case in
pre-war times. That is one of the lessons of the
war which have not been forgotten.
The Japanese have, therefore, either to invent
these things for themselves or find them out from
other Powers. The first they have little hope of
doing, and the second even less.
There is no British naval mission in Japan
to-day, as there was for years before the
war, to keep the Japanese instructed in cur-
rent naval developments. There is no one
to show them how aeroplanes are used in
the navies of other great Powers to assist
in spotting and reconnoitring. Those days
of ingenuous naval camaraderie are past.
Japan must now depend on its own sons to
supply it with such knowledge; and signs
are not wanting that the task is proving too
much for them. Japanese ships are well
armed and well built; the personnel is keen,
and the men are capable seamen. It would
be idle to belittle the efficiency of the navy
as a navy. But it is the efficiency of 1918,
and seven long years lie in between. In
those years technical improvements in the
armament and accessories of a modern fleet
—improvements introduced by the inventive
genius of the Occident —have completely
changed naval warfare. The aeroplane has
revolutionised gunnery, and wireless tele-
phony, with other wireless inventions, is
rapidly revolutionising communication. Bong-
range, fast-running torpedoes have necessi-
tated a revision of fleet tactics. Whereas
destroyers at Jutland approached to within
n range of 5000 yards of the enemy and
fired their torpedoes with impunity, to-day
at a range of 15,000 yards the destroyer may
look for trouble. Submarines are not the
modest craft of ten years ago. and the Bri-
tish, U.S., French and Italian naval autho-
rities keep a tight hold on the plans of these
and similar vessels. Japan is not abreast
of the times in these matters. There is re-
liable evidence that for want of external
assistance the Japanese have come to a vir-
tual standstill in gunnery-control. They
know little about long-range firing, and com-
munication between their aeroplanes and
their ships is believed to be so poor
that it is questionable whether they
could use aeroplanes at all for spotting
or reconnaisance. As for submarines, the
Japanese are not building any exceeding
2000 tons, and those they are build-
ing arc much inferior to the new British
XI type. Japan’s only chance of catching
up is to persuade the British or the Ameri-
cans to lend it a large staff of technical
advisers, such as it had before the war. But
the likelihood of a permanent British or
American naval mission being established at
Tokyo is remote.

Pianos and Reflections.
The piano is an article which the Australian
can make as well as any other person, and
better than most. All the same, the day
of imported, fairly low-priced and long-
credit machines made by non-British labor
has come back in earnest, and a good Aus-
tralian industry is sinking for lack of that
adequate Protection which it is so hard to
extract from an ex-importer Prime Minister
and a Country-party-big-landlord Treasurer.
This is how recent importations of “pianos
and parts” have progressed :
1921- . . £288,902 I 1923-24 . . £1,109,652
1922- .. 554,911 j 9 months of ’24-’25 899,693
Consequently the noise-machines are now
coming in at the rate of £1,200,000 per annum.
Many are shoddy affairs, and at the same
time outwardly beautiful, made of old ante-
bellum parts glued together, but the shoddi-
ness doesn’t affect the sale so much as with
some other goods. Most people buy one
piano and one coffin in a lifetime, and if
both are gimcrack it is little use deciding
to be more careful next time. And a new
fool is always born to replace the one who
is buried. When the Germans got to the
point of unloading 5000 pianos on Britain
per month the British Government resolved
to try its hand at some exclusion, Free-
trade or no Freetrade, and the chances are
that Baldwin may get there before Bruce.
The reason for the invariable new loan in
London is that this country’s regular bill
for goods bought abroad, and for* freight
by other people’s ships on goods bought
abroad, and for interest on loans raised
abroad is far more than its exports
will cover. There is no assured way
of regulating the exports, which depend
mostly on the kind of weathea* here and the
amount of competition elsewhere. (For in-
stance, Russia is struggling painfully back
to its old position as a country with surplus
grain to sell, and is liable at any moment
to make the wheat market Hook foolish.)
But imports can be regulated .by providing
a tariff which will keep our otwn factories
open and our own people employed. For
want of such a tariff the finanrial collapse
has gone on in this fashion: —

State .. 263,412,174 342.660,422 79,248.248
£110,092,040
When figures are available to June, 1925, it
will probably be found that the) situation is
20 millions worse, for the foreign, loan mad-
ness has been progressing gaily. What Aus-
tralia gets out of the transaction in the pre-
sent is:—
(1) A receipt for the year’s foreign '-.interest bill.
The pretence that foreign interest, payable in gold
or surplus goods, is met in any way sure by new
borrowings has become too thin for •further con-
sideration.
(2) Lots of foreign pianos, clothing sind the like.
(3) Lots of unemployment, poverty, i misery and
dissatisfaction.
And what it may get in the future 1 , provided
that the future resembles the past, includes:
(4) A long dismal period of much more work for
less pay, such as followed the collapse <of 1893, for
the process of paying old interest out of new loans,
and borrowing a little more with which to “fill ’em
up again, Mfs. Publichoitse,” will create a scare
among lenders one of these days. Or
(5) Bankruptcy, and composition with the public
creditor, the full consequences of which are un-
certain, though they are certain to be unpleasant.
Or
(6) Something so much resembling a horrid revo-
lution that many will mistake it for one. Those
who preach bloodshed and upheaval to fairly large
audiences now will preach with much more energy to
much bigger and more credulous audiences if they
can raise the cry that the “capitalistic system'’ has
broken down at last.
The revolutionists have an ally in the mis-
guided section of the Country party which
wants a reduced tariff, less manufactures,
and still more imports, with the natural
corollary of still further dependence on the
foreign loan market. They are helping along
what, it is hoped in the best Communist
circles, will prove a valuable catastrophe.
And the Country party gets an uplift when
an eloquent United States gentleman of the
Admiral Coontz variety comes this way, and
is given more newspaper space than the case
calls for. The Coontzes have a marvellous
knack of spreading the idea that Uncle
Samuel made his pile and secured a mort-
gage on the globe, not by cultivating manu-
facturing industry with a high tariff and
other means, but by going out into the
“desert” (now practically abolished by genius
and hard spade work), and there growing
vegetables like the happy and prosperous
Russian peasant. The inference is, of course,
that Australia shouldn't imitate Uncle's
tariff or trench on Ms manufacturing mono-
poly, but should buy its piano and motor-
ear from him in a contrite spirit, and con-
centrate in a bull-headed way on its own
desert.

Law Reform in X. S. Wales.
So far nothing has been heard from the Rang
Government on the subject of law reform.
This seems remarkable as law has been a
kind of jousting-ground for almost every
N. S. Wales Government for many years past.
The Fuller Administration appointed a com-
mission to deal with the question, mainly
from the point of view of pleading and modi-
fication, but, like so many previous attempts
at reform, this one wandered forth into the
legal wilderness and nothing further has
been heard of it. Yet there is scarcely any
one, lawyer or layman, who does not admit
that something should be done to lighten the
burden imposed upon litigants, who so often
find the remedy woi’se than the disease. For
one thing, the present system of plead-
ing, at any rate on the common-law side,
is mostly a w r aste of time and an expense.
The idea that the statement of the cause of
action —“declaration,” to give it its full-dress
name —should be a long-winded document, full
of the most extraordinary six-and-eightpenny
phrases conceivable, is surely a relic of the
days of Baron Parke, when technicality pure
and undefiled so often decided an issue to
the confounding of justice and commonsense.
Take, for example, an action for fraudulent
misrepresentation in the sale of a business. In
“declaring” on this cause of action it is
necessary for the plaintiff to allege in the
document (a) a representation of fact by
defendant, (b) which was false (c) to the
knowledge of the defendant, (d) inducing
the plaintiff to act upon it, (e) that he did
act upon it, and (f) that he suffered damage.
If any one of these allegations is omitted
the declaration is “demurrable.” While
it may well be necessary to prove these vari-
ous allegations at the trial, what on earth is
there to object to in a mechanical
form of alleging the cause of action, be if
what it may? The form might even be
printed with a few blanks left for certain par-
ticulars to be filled in. If it simply mentioned
the names of the plaintiff and defendant,
their addresses and so forth, and stated the
cause of action as “fraudulently represent-
ing the takings of a certain business to he
fx per week, whereas they were only £x 5
per week.” a defendant would not he in the
least misled. Yet the jargon which has pre-
vailed since the Middle Ages still holds sway,
and litigants have to go to solicitors and
barristers to get such declarations drawn
up when they could quite as well,
by a simplified method of procedure,
fill in a form (or endorse the cause of action
on the back of the writ) themselves. The
ancient anachronisms known as “the common
counts” and “the general issue,” which give
no facts at all and keep everybody completely
in the dark as to what the claim for the
defence is. should he swept away by a short,
general statement of the facts relied on as
all that is necessary. A further reform which
would help matters in the direction of keep-
ing down costs is a modification of the ridi-
culous two-thirds rule. Under the present
system a junior barrister who. appears
in a ease with a K.C. is allowed two-thirds
of the senior's fee. This, as a rule, is more
than the junior would get if he conducted
the case himself. The anomaly arises partly
from the fact that the trial Judge has no
discretion in the matter of costs. “Costs
follow the event” is the common-law rule,
and although the taxing-officer is allowed a
certain discretion as to amount, the most
paltry case may drag on for days, swallow
up far more than the matter litigated about,
perhaps ruin one of the parties, and yet
the costs of all the time occupied must
be allowed. There is no reason why a fixed
scale for counsel's fees should not he drawn
up, varying with the amount involved or re-
covered. Provision could be made that
King’s Counsel’s fees should not he allowed
where the claim is under a stated amount,
unless the presiding Judge certifies that the
case was a proper one in which to employ
a senior. And it should he necessary to have
a Judge’s certificate for every “refresher”
after the first; this would tend to prevent
loquacious or tedious K.C.’s, from emphasis-
ing the justice of complaints against the
law's delay. A further advantage to the
public (and to the profession also) would be
a modification of the rule of etiquette that
a barrister can take work only through a
solicitor. An exception to this could and
should be made in the case of opinions. In
most cases at present the solicitor docs no
work at all in the matter of the opinion

The Campaign Against Australian Trees.
There was a time in the history of this
country when the entire population that
wasn’t black was immigrant. The literature
that comes down from that not very distant
period is mainly an example of the myopia
that homesickness usually inflicts. The
flowers that surrounded the early settlers
had no scent, the birds no song; the open,
sunny parklands of the Australian bush were
terrifying in their sombre gloom. To the Aus-
tralian-born, this attitude to-day seems comic
if he ever thinks about it; but he very seldom
does. He takes the fact that this country
is his home for granted, and does not realise
how very shallowly his roots have entered
into his native soil. There is in
the Sydney Botanical Gardens a More-
ton Bay flgtree which has a dome of
leaves nobler than London’s St. Paul’s,
and a mighty trunk and downward
reaching roots as inspiring in their strength
as the columns' of a Doric temple. It
might, in fact, inspire a more mystically-
minded race to come on annual pilgrimage
and burn joss-sticks to it as a symbol of
Australian nationhood. The other day an
Englishman raged in a Sydney paper against
the whole tribe of Moreton Bays. He stig-
matised them as dirty, ugly and ignoble, and
recommended their extermination and re-
placement by English trees, “the loveliest of
their kind.” The latter sentiment was very
proper in an Englishman; what was sad-
dening was the fact that the challenge to
Australian individuality was left to lie, for
not a single answer came from the native-
born. So general is this indifference that
a department of the City Council thought
it could destroy a whole row of the trees
with impunity, and it was only the agitation
of a small group of enthusiasts that saved
their city from these official vandals. The
case of the trees is symptomatic of the gen-
eral attitude. Australia has playwrights,
but no Australian theatre; she has sculptors,
but her public places are adorned with dis-
mal plaster copies of European statues, and
not the best of those ; she has a White Aus-
tralian policy, and allows her northern areas
to be developed in part by Italians, China-
men and Japanese; she has a Labor party
which has become the plaything of imported
Communists; and she has factories, but pre-
fers to buy imported shoddy. It might save
a lot of trouble if a Royal Commission were
appointed to decide which of the foreign
countries was most worthy to be copied, and
set about the job on a comprehensive scale.
O
There has been printed, in a blue desert of
157 large pages, the full report of that crude
make-believe, the Royal Commission on the
subdivision of N.S.W. into smaller States.
It sat for 13 months, and cost £24,951, of
which Holman, ex-Premier and K.C., re-
ceived £3217. The Government’s natural de-
sire to provide a comfortable cheque for
Holman may have been one reason for the
appointment of the Commission. Many ad-
mirers allege that nobody who knew Holman
could help wanting to provide him with a
cheque. His business, and that of his junior
(£2336), was apparently to assist the Com-
mission in the collection of excuses for doing
nothing, which that body was ready enough
to do in any case.. To say that something
should be done might involve suggesting how
it should be done, and heavy details are
apt to be a burden to gentlemen who are
past their first youth and were never of an
exploratory disposition even in their wildest
days. The really influential part of the
Commission was “pure Sydney,” and the
typical Sydneyite sees very little wrong with
a system which brings his city such a mono-
poly of trade, and is expected to make it
soon the Second Biggest Human Mass in
the Empire, though with scarcely any popu-
lation behind it. The report contains a mar-
vellous mixture of items, including a list of
;the States of the U.S. which repudiated
their debts (principally due in England), and
the amount of the fraud, the number of
junior teachers in Victoria, and the preven-
tion of tick. With the addition of a paper
pattern and a good recipe for apple fritters
it would be a bosker report.
+
“J.H.M.A.”: Among the Sydney police the
behavior of Uncle Sam’s sailors and marines
during their fortnight’s stay won unstinted
praise, which most citizens will echo. Sydney
is not an easy place to be good in at any
time, and to young men fresh from months at
sea, and in the pink of condition, her ready
alcoholic hospitality might well have pro-
vided an excuse for considerably higher
kicking than was indulged in by those who
daily and nightly swarmed in and about her
places of refreshment and entertainment
whilst ashore from the battleships on leave.
But, with few exceptions, they comported
themselves like young gentlemen on their best
behavior, and the exceptions in no case were
any worse than might be observed in the
Harbor City’s crooked streets on any Satur-
day afternoon or evening. It is true that
they were very strongly policed by their own
club-wielding special patrols, and it may be
that a consciousness of the poor protection
their quaint little caps afford against a tap
from the ready batons is in itself con-
ducive to a spirit of law’n’order. (Indeed,
one has heard the theory propounded that
this queer headgear is provided by U.S.N.
authorities so that young Sam Seadog may
be easily “persuaded” to return aboard
quietly, after having reached the limit.) But
whether that be so or not, it was obvious
that the great majority of them had every
disposition to be decorous. Some of us have
quite vivid recollections of the capacity of
Australian soldiers —both in S’Africa and
the Great War —for painting towms red, and
will not hesitate to admit that a division of
our own lads would have made things a
good deal more willing, in such a place as
Sydney, than the “bo’s” did. Wherefore, it
may be suggested that Admiral Robison
should be recommended to bestow' one good-
conduct stripe apiece on his merry—but not
too merry—men, on account of their deport-
ment round the coasts and hinterlands of
Port .Tackson.

“N.Iv.C.”: Here is an anomaly in matri-
monial law —the Victorian, at any rate.
Domestic unhappiness forced me to leave my
home. Taking my children. I obtained a posi-
tion at my old occupation, teaching, but the
salary was so inadequate that I consulted
a lawyer with regard to a claim for main-
tenance. To my surprise I was informed
that, although I might easily obtain a divorce,
I was not entitled to maintenance, as I was
not destitute in the meaning of the Act.
In other words, because I had struck out
for myself and my children, I was entitled
to nothing. I learned that if I resigned
and came to Court with only a few shillings
and a tale of woe I could claim support;
in short, that the law r with regard to main-
tenance only helps those who won’t help
themselves. Added to this injustice, my eyes
are always falling on a departmental notice
that “as you are a married woman, you can
now be employed only in a temporary capa-
city and at the salary for temporary
teachers.”

“Gouger” : In my judgment the richest por-
tion of Australia, as far as natural endow-
ments go. is the coastal belt between Cardwell
, *, . . T j ux -e a-
and Cooktown (Q.). I doubt if any portion
of the world is more happily placed as re-
gards rich tropical soil, climate, water,
timber and minerals. The timber is in matted
jungles. There are scores of varieties not
yet classified, and the different species are
numerous enough to supply all the possible
wants of man. They grade from the very
hardest wood to the softest, and there an
vast quantities of the Moreton Bay chestnut,
samples of which when sent to London were
pronounced by timber merchants there as
being fully equal to the finest pollard oak.
Many of the trees, especially those growing
up tiie mountain heights, secrete oils, tars
and sweet-smelling perfumes. The nuts and
berries of some also contain medicinal oils,
a few known to the abos. These rolling
ranges, with their dense and sharply varying
species of vegetation, should be a paradise
for the botanical chemist, as well as the
timber-man. There are found trees possess
irig, when crushed, the power of blinding
and stupefying fish; a so-called stinging-
tree ; a stunted tree that yields a
sap reminiscent of hot tar; the ‘■kero-
sene-tree,” which will blaze green from
the axe as if saturated in the oil; and many
others possessing peculiar properties. As
for the ordinary timbers of commerce, a man
might well tax his brains wondering why
we import timber when we possess such
gigantic forests and scrubs, over great areas
of which only an odd lonely prospector has
cast eyes from some grand mountain-peak.
Since the last war scores of bogeys about
the horrors of the uext have been lifted up.
The latest is canned lightning, claimed by
its inventor, Dr. Edwin Scott, of San Fran-
cisco, to be capable of (1) destroying all life
on land, sea and in the air within a radius
of 20 miles, (2) bringing down the top
hamper of battleships at a range of 10 miles,
and (3) winging aeroplanes at any height.
In the meantime, although several death and
poison rays have been reported from France,
that country continues to conduct its cam-
paign against the Riffs in much the same
old way, and the Riffs, at latest, are re-
ported to have dug themselves in after the
manner of Wellington in the Peninsular
War.

“Country Fed.” : Alexander Peacock, Vic.
Minister of Education, gave the State schools
within 20 miles of the G.P.O. one day’s holi-
day to view the march past of the American
sailors; to schools in provincial centres
where smaller but similar parades were to
take place.he granted a half-holiday. Pressed
to allow country children and their teachers
the larger concession, he steadfastly refused,
though it would have been good policy. The
counti’y teacher is always hankering after a
job in the city, principally because the Edu-
cation Department does so little to make the
rural position attractive; therefore, there is
inevitably a certain hostility in his attitude
towards country life. The children are
pretty sure to catch it from him; and when,
as in the ■ present instance, a teacher en-
deavors to give his pupils some conception
of the pageant, and tells his eager-
eyed listeners that city children would be
seeing it, the youngsters naturally feel
resentful that they are denied the same
opportunity. And this resentment is con-
tinued and intensified until the time comes
for them to leaye home —and the city swal-
lows them. Of course, this is only one
phase of the centralisation evil, but it is a
bigger phase than is usually recognised. Make
the country teacher more satisfied with his
lot, even to giving him extra concessions to
compensate for his remoteness from the big
centres, and you are going a long way to
making country folk scorn the call of the
city, for the teacher’s contentment or dis-
content will be reflected in his charges.

State cattle-stations were part of a bright
scheme, launched in Queensland ten years
ago, for providing the multitude with cheap
meat. By the end of 1919 the happy experi-
menters had bought sundry pastoral holdings
and established 34 butchers’ shops. Inthatyear
they supplied 21 per cent, of the total beef
devoured within the State, and charged 4.88 d.
per lb. for it, the customer doing his own
delivering. It was loudly asserted that, the
private butcher was doomed. In 1924, how-
ever, the Government supplied only 14 per
cent, of the total beef consumed, and charged
5.661 b. per lb. for it, the valuation of stock
on the State stations having meanwhile
fallen from £4.90 to £3.61 per head. During
the past three years 3380 bullocks were
killed for rations on the Government runs
(there was an average of 336 employees),
8658 were sold to the socialistic butcheries,
and 26,72 S went to capitalistic buyers. In
effect, the employees devoured 10 bullocks
for every 216 that passed through the shops.
And while the retail price of Government
beef went up 16 p.c., there was a decrease
in the cost of 42 commodities of food and
groceries in Brisbane, where 24 out of the
57 Government butcheries are. Now £674,189
has been “written off” the outlay on the
Government stations, 'which means that the
taxpayer will go on paying interest on that
amount, it having been borrowed abroad with
no provision for a sinking fund. Meantime
the Golden Age refuses to arrive.

is an easier place to reach than many people think.
Saving is largely a matter of habit. People who go straight
ahead saving—and those who don’t—both may at one time
or another have trouble in making ends meet.

the difference is that those who do not save never reach Easy

POLITICAL
POINTS.
It was reported last week that the settlers
at Borroloolo (N. Territory) were back in
their frequent state of semi-starvation.
There being no railways thereabouts, and
casual traffic having left the coast because
of the Navigation Act or something, they
depend on the Government boat, which is
generally a generation late. At last advices
this craft had been declared “black” because
two of the long-victimised Fordsdale men were
found on board. Many months ago an illegal
strike was ordered among the well-paid crew
of this Commonwealth ship, and though no-
body refused a few hesitated. These latter
have been pursued ever since with a malig-
ity of persecution which does credit to the
ingenuity of the imported bosses of the show,
and it isn’t likely that the treaty which has
allegedly been patched up will include them.
In fact, it isn’t likely that it will include
anybody for long unless the new deportation
law brisks up. When the Commonwealth
shipping line knuckled down for the sake of
peace it apparently forgot to make any terms
for its old employees.
“Ninety-nine per cent, criminal” is N.S.W.
Premier Lang’s description of the foreign-
horn 1.W.W., which has risen again in Syd-
ney, and declares that it has come to make
“strife, strikes and job-control.” A few
years ago some of the sect were convicted of
a brisk attempt to burn down Sydney. They
got a new trial and were convicted. They
contrived to get a Commission and a third
trial, and were convicted. Then a Govern-
ment, of which Lang was a leading member,
came in and imported a tame litV )e Julge, on
whose tame little verdict they wG pleased.
Possibly the I.W.W. was only 984 per sent,
criminal in those days.
A laborious Royal Commission lias decided
by a majority that it is rotten logic to treat
Papua as part of the Commonwealth for
Navigation Act purposes, and make its bit
of trade the burdens which that in-
volves, and at the same time to treat it as
foreign for tariff purposes and tax its goods
at the Customs as if they _ arrived from
foreign parts in cheap foreign ships. A
minority of one disagreed, and said that the
Navigation Act should still apply, because
otherwise “the trade would be lost to Aus-
tralia.” The total trade of Papua (exports
and imports) amounted to £693,222 in the
last year before the Act, and in 1922-23 it
was down to £494,875. What it became after
that will be known in due time, hut it hardly
seems worth fussing about. The case isn’t
so bad as that of the Northern Territory,
where the recorded trade dropped in the same
period from £306,683 to £27,431, and later
to £22.432, but it is real Australian pioneer-
ing. all the same. Possibly Tortoise Bruce
and his henchman. Turtle Pearce will think
out something in time.
The role of injured innocent was again
assumed by the Metropolitan Gas Co. when
reference had to be made to the Vie. Gov-
ernment’s proposal to buy it out and place
the works under a hoard or trust to run.
A shareholder. named Allen, blunter than
John Grice, said that the Government should
cash up or shut up. The humorous thing
was that Grice had been complaining that
the Ministry had been shutting up.too much
for the taste of himself and. his fellow-
directors, inasmuch as it hadn’t said what
it was going to pay. No doubt Grice and eo.
expect to win again. In the last 30 years
whenever any Government has dared to say
that it will regulate, control, absorb or other-
wise interfere with the Melbourne gas con-
cern something has always happened to
paralyse its wrist.
It is characteristic of the decay of indepen-
dence and self-governing capacity, or at least
of the self-governing habit, that the I.W.W.
crowd reappeared soon after the advent of
the Lang Government and early in the Fleet:
visit, and took up a loud and public attitude
in Sydney Domain. It is supposed to be
prohibited, but that doesn’t count for much,
The Australian seems in a fair way to be
prohibited himself before long. The I.W.W.
organisation is imported, like Communism,
and the Communist leader, who is imported
himself, gave it a warm welcome on its re-
appearance as a fellow worker for the destruc-
tion of capital and for the general confisca-
tion of things. He said cheerfully that it
would put hew vim into the Labor movement,
GOOD-BYE-EE-EE.

S] - de on “ w hite ant” principles, so it is evi-
dent]y taken f Ol . granted that the I.W.W. is

Although the only difference made in t 1
personnel of the Vic. Tippah Chambah m
June was the substitution of Hitchcock for
Austin, and of Tuckett for Robinson, the elec-
tion cost the State £4340. For the nine un-
contested seats the outlay was from £26 to
£lO each, but the eight contests ate up
money. To re-elect White for Western £<o4
was spent, and £»2b was scattered to induce
slightly less than one-fourth of the electors
of East Yarra to furnish a majority sufliei-
ent to send Edgar back to Ins x4OO-a-year
job as Chairman of Committees. Russell
Clarke has the melancholy satisfaction ot
knowing that the taxpayers will be levied
upon to the extent of £623 to give him a
further term, irrespective of the £l2OO he
will draw in six years as a member; and
Tuckett, the new Cocky member for the
Northern Province, will perhaps take pride
in the fact that the poll bill in his case, £626,
was £226 more than the account for Mel-
bourne South, for which constituency Frank
Clarke, the President, was chosen.
The Tariff Board, sitting at Sydney to
hear about imported picture films, was
greeted by “unanimous opposition from repre-
sentatives of the film industry” to any in-
crease of duty. As it presently transpired
that “representatives of the industry” were
a great deal more importers than industrial-
ists, this was easily explained. A typical
witness, whose concern owned two studios,
spoke up thus :
The average aimed at was eight to ten pictures
annually. Australia required 500 feature pictures a
year. Of this number about 35 were English pro-
ductions and 15 Continental films. The remaining
450 were the pick of the American output of 650
per annum.
He added that his firm kept “fully-staffed
offices” in New York and other centres to
spend Australian money on Adolph Zukor-
isms and the like. Another witness said that
the Australian buyer in the U.S. had to
“enter into a contract for 52 pictures annu-
ally”—in other words he had to stock up
so that he would have practically no room for
Australian work, or else lie could go with-
out. The mistake on which the importing
“representatives of the industry” based their
case was 'that Australia “requires 500 feature
pictures per year.” It doesn’t —not any more
than the U.S. requires 500 fleets loaded with
rum per year. Australia doesn’t even re-
quire 5000 race meetings or 15,000 two-up
schools annually, and it has no legitimate
demand for cocaine. The foreign film habit
should be discouraged till the country learns
to meet its own demand.
The pioneering instinct isn’t strong among
Australia’s easy-chair rulers. The Com-
monwealth lias invested £34,775,550 of loan
money in putting soldiers “on the land.” Of
this £11,794,075 was spent in Victoria, which
is the nearest approach to a crowded region
that Australia possesses, and where soil is
so scarce and dear that the swindled warrior
was sometimes charged £l7 an acre foi
swamp where his cows drowned, or rock
where they broke their necks. And £6940
was invested in settlement in the Northern
Territory, which is six times the size of Vic-
toria, where the population is almost nil.
and where the Commonwealth’s own land is
waiting gratis if only people could get to it.
The idea that Bruce is a reincarnation of
Cortez is quite discredited now. A great
many people had doubts from tin l first.
The latest news from the seat of war in
S.A. Assembly, where verbal hostilities have
been raging for weeks'over the Gunn Gov-
ernment’s Thousand Homes, is that Attorney-
General Denny, after requesting one of the
Barwellians to “repeat that outside,’’ has
issued a writ against Harwell himself. Also,
the impetuous Opposition-leader, having been
called to account by the whole Cabinet, has
“unreservedly withdrawn and expressed re-
gret’’ for remarks made in a speech at Burn-
side. Meanwhile the Royal Commissioner,
who is invariably called in at an early
stage of an Australian Government housing
scheme, has entered upon his formidable
task.
The strike of 50.000 woollen workers at
Bradford (England) is an effort of despair.
The reason is a proposed reduction of 5 per-
cent. in wages, which were low enough
already. Unfortunately even at low wages
the manufacturers couldn’t hold their own
in the British market on Freetrade principles
against the competition of all the world.
Imports, in 1924, were £182,000,000 more
than in 1928, and there was no correspond-
ing increase in exports. The foreigner had
either to be kept out by a tariff where he
was competing against British goods, or he
had to be undersold, even the cheapest of
him, and undersold all along the line, or
places like Bradford had to close. The crazy
vote for more Freetrade which the British
workers gave in 1928, and the fact that the
Conservatives were afraid to ask for a Pro-
tectionist mandate in 1924. when they might
have got it whole-heartedly, are the matters
which are wrong with Bradford and the
British Isles in general. Scotland, which
depends so much on engineering and ship-
building, seems to have suffered more than
the average. For the second year in succes-
sion the official estimate shows it as losing
population, and it was the least densely in-
habited of the kingdoms to begin with. It
will be a calamity if the Caledonian bab.\
goes out of circulation.
It will be a long time before it is possible
to ascertain the whole amount lost in the
struggle to plant soldiers on the land that
thev might grow things which this country,
as a rule, doesn’t want and has ro export in
hired ships, instead of planting them in fac-
tories to make things which it does want
and for which it would have an abundant
demand if the tariff was what a tariff should
be. The N.S.W. Government is about to
write off £4,000.000, out of £13,700,000 ad-
vanced, as beyond recovery, and the Common-
wealth is providing for a loss of £10,000,000
of which part is in N.S.W. Nobody pro-
fesses that this is final, but it is some loss
to go on with. Nor does anyone mention
that the Ma State has lost as much as
£1,300,000 in a year by carrying produce by
rail at less than half the cost of carriage,
provided it is moving towards Sydney, but
not otherwise. Still, if soldier-settlement
has increased the volume of this class of
business, part of the loss which is always
going on should be debited to soldier-settle-
ment. There is now confabulation in high
quarters about a plan for planting 450,000
British “migrants” in this country during
the next ten years, which will involve a pile
of money, and also another pile of muddle,
unless the citv politicians who run the busi-
ness have better luck than in the past.
Having possibly an uneasy sensation in
vicinity of the pylorus, the N.S.W. Govern-
ment keeps assuring itself that things went
very well during its last brief essay at a 44-
lumr week. Referring to the “1000 new fac-
tories” alleged to have been opened in 1921-
22 (519, according to the Commonwealth
Statistician), the Chamber of Manufactures
man reports that 102 were motor-garages,
185 were butchers’ shops which promoted
themselves to be factories through the instal-
lation of electric sausage-machines, 108 were
old boot workshops which added new elec-
tric motors, and the rest were mostly little
hush sawmills and chaff-chopping sheds of
long standing, but previously overlooked.
Apparently the Labor crowd didn’t overlook
much. An outstanding feature was the small
increase in employees, especially males. In
1921-22 the number of male factory em-
ployees advanced from 112,187 to 112,362
(increase 175). And the Langs and Dooleys
didn’t make their last experiment at a time
of general depression, with their Communist
friends playing the intoxicated ox amid the
ruins of industry.
A BALLADE OF CHEAPENED WISDOM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The N.S.W Labor Ministry has reduced the price
of Hansard, raised by the National Government,
from 15s. to ss. per session and from 4d. to 2d. a
single copy.”
Scant wonder that the man who earns
His wage with sudorific brow
Exults when Labor rule returns
And makes a glad and cheerful row.
’Tis natural, you must allow.
Observe, what cost last week a crown
The hall, or less, will purchase now.
The price of Hansard’s tumbled down.
True, no reduction one discerns
• Yet in the product' of the cow,
Straight-—-or emerging from the churns
As stuff wherewith you may endow
Your bread, And bread itself somehow
Keeps up, in country and in town.
But straws will indicate, I trow,
How blows the wind —and Hansard’s down.
The figure charged for meat concerns
Most ev’rybody but a Chow.
How precious ’tis he quickly learns
Who through a hash-house steak will plough,
'the chap who likes to dip his prow
in what was once “October brown”
To post-war charges still must bow.
But Hansard's drastically down.

•In H.C.L.’s financial slough
I’ve feared at times to choke or drown,
But here is glorious news, I vow—
The price of Hansard’s volplaned down.

A WANING AFFECTION.
BORRY: “But why do you think I don’t love
you as much as ever?”
BETTY: “Because you didn’t come hack to
kiss me last night after you said good-
bye for the last time.”
"Karol. 1 Hardupp”: One couldn't help
noticing the casual way in which the Ameri-
cans leave their valuable warships lying
about, so to speak. Pressmen in Melbourne
who lobbed out to these huge craft found
that the documentary evidence of their bona-
tides was quite unnecessary; they simply
walked on board and wandered where they
willed; nobody was even curious enough to
ask their names, or what papers they repre-
sented. A handful of spirited Communists
who really wanted to steal an might
have found the business quite easy. Even in
the Australian Navy they are not as casual
as that. Certainly a friend and myself once
did board an Australian gunboat, but we
were soon held up, and asked by what
authority we were there. “Well, now, that’s
cool!” said my friend. “Why, we’re two of
the owners!”
* * * *
“A.J.M.” : It was a forlorn-looking dog of
shockingly depraved ancestry. Something of
the Australian terrier peeped through the
general disguise; a little of the hairiness of
the kelpie ; the rest was unclassifiable. Pos-
sibly the American sailor who led him on a
string saw him as a worth-while mascot,
glorified by the mist of many hospitable
beers, or perhaps he was just the outward
manifestation of that curious collecting
mania that often seizes on the halt-sozzled.
At all events he attracted more attention
that ever before in his disgraceful life. A
fashionably-dressed woman stopped to admire
him. “Isn’t it a dear?” she purred. What
sort of a dog is it?” The saiior-owner said,
“Yes, ’m; it’s a good dawg,” which duln t
help much. It was a lanky hard-bitten
Digger who rushed into the breach. ‘ That.
Ma’am,” he said impressively, “is. the first
of its kind to be seen in Australia It is
a very rare dog, the Hawaiian wolf-hound.
And as I left lie was giving the spellbound
lady details of the mongrel’s descent from
the savage Hula-hula dog of the mountains,
with an open-mouthed American tar regard-
ing him in dumb wonder.
* * * *
“Nikko”: Dwellers in certain Maoriland
districts are unanimous that nobody ever
gets used to earthquakes, no matter how
frequently they occur. A town with
a good sway on, all the clocks str king,
all the bells ringing, the surf (if a seaside
place) missing its break, houses creaking,
pictures scraping and banging, accompanied
with smashes, bursting pipes and small fires
-—all this is an experience never to be forgot-
ten. A few years ago Rotorua had a trem-
bling fit, and'after a night of 42 ’quakes the
entire visiting population left per first train,
many having sat outside on their luggage all
night. But then a ’quake in Rotorua may
presage anything, and nobody can view un-
moved the prospect of going up in smoke or
down in boiling water.
* * * *
“Jean”’: No need to go far from home for
jibbing brides (B. 23/7/’25). At Marrick-
ville (N.S.W.) only last year the leading
lady, owing to the breakdown of her taxi,
arrived at the church very late; whereupon
the bridegroom most ungallantly reprimanded
her before all the assembled guests. The
wedding service proceeded, but when the
officiating clergyman came _ to the “Wilt
thou” the bride replied, “I will not,” and the
ceremony broke off abruptly.
* * * *
“Trooper 926”: The professional fees of
the old-time public executioner (B. 16/7/’25)
were increased by perquisites and tips. The
hangman was lawfully entitled to the clothes
of his late client. If the relatives desired to
buy them from him they were given the
chance, otherwise the garments went to the
second-hand clothes-dealer. After the 1715
rising in England, the hangman of the period,
according to one chronicler, “received ample
douceurs for civility money, in placing the
halter’s knot right under the left ear and
separating their quarters with all imaginable
decency.” The nobleman and the highway-
man were both valuable clients. The former
could be relied on for liberal gratuities, and
the foppery of a Claude Duval made him a
bird worth plucking. His clothes were gen-
erally keenly bid for as souvenirs. The ori-
ginal Jack Ketch, by the way, flourished
from 1063 to 1686. The only break in his
tenure of office was when he was deposed for
insolence to the sheriffs, but luck was with
him, and he was reinstated when his succes-
sor was convicted of murder. Ketch hanged
him.
*■***»
“Iford”: A stern determination to preserve
the well of English undefiled still animates
N.S.W. Judge Curlewis. A few months ago
it was the word “bike” that grated on his
Honor’s susceptibilities, and last week an
advocate was pulled up by the same
literary precisian for using that concise and
expressive phrase “on his own.” The abbre-
viation “pub” is another that is on the Cur-
lewis black list, though “cab” or “mob.” being
somewhat better matured, would doubtless
pass muster. Fortunately most judges are
more sensible or less pedantic; a day or two
after “on his own” had been ruled out in
the Arbitration Court another Sydney judge,
possibly with a twinkle in his eye, charac-
terised a question put by counsel as a
“double-header,” nor did anybody affect to
misunderstand what was meant. The judge
who refuses to admit that language as well
as law doesn’t move with the times is some-
thing of a trial himself. Thirty years ago
writer heard one of these ultra-precise souls
—he was a C.J.. too —sternly reproving a
witness for speaking of “getting aboard a
train.” The rebuke seemed about the dead
limit in childishness, but, if Curlewis per-
sists, we may find him going one better.
•
“Alwyn”: Apropos the vagaries of out-
back J’s.F. Some years ago the local police-
sergeant at a small N.S.W. western centre was
hurriedly summoned to Sydney. Before leav-
ing he left this note for the guidance of the
Bench: “I regret I have to go to Sydney
on urgent business, so cannot be in court
this morning. There is one trivial case —
James Blank. I would not give him a sen-
tence; let him off with a caution.” . Later
the same day, and well nigh apoplectic with
rage, his Worship unburdened himself : “Con-
found his impudence, teaching me my busi-
ness! I’ll teach him. I gave the beggar six
months.” *
“The Jongleur”: The Puritanism of Maori-
land has probably been exaggerated, /the
other day three youthful bachelors, desiring
to take a flat at the least possible cost, rang
up a number to make inquiries. One ot the
questions they asked was “Is the bedroom big
enough for three to sleep in?” And the first
reply, a Socratic one, from the other end ot
AREN’T WE ALL?
“Your husband’s an awful liar.”
“Why? Has the brute been telling you you are the only woman he ever really loved?”
“No — he said you were.”
the wire came in large-hearted feminine
tones: “And now, what would you be —two
ladies and a gentleman?”
# * * *
“Forebridge”: I recall one occasion on
which certain mariners insisted on sailing
with a corpse (B. 30/7/’25). It happened
in a British cruiser bound from Singapore to
Mauritius. A “makee-learn” Chinese steward
had died, and the weather being very torrid
and port nearly a week ahead, the usual
preparations were made for the immediate
disposal of the body. The padre had actu-
ally begun to read the burial service when
the Chinese messman appeared and excitedly
declared that neither he nor any of his staff
would continue their work if their compatriot
was dumped overside. Arguments and tureats
were in vain, and the defunct Chink was
eventually spared the indignity of meeting
his celestial ancestors clad in seaweed. The
corpse was placed in a coffin and locked up m
a gun-casemate until our arrival at Mau-

SUE: “I’m collecting for the suffering poor.”

them for hours!”
ritius. I remember the incident particularly
well, because the unsavory task of represent-
ing the wardroom at the obsequies on shore
fell to my lot.
“Ben Zinc”: The desertion of a certain
Maorilander to the enemy (B. 9/7/’25) did
not happen in the Somme battle, but at
“Haig's Gap,” Armentiferes, about July, T 6.
It was at “stand-to,” at dawn, when the in-
dividual in question announced from the fire-
step that he saw a wounded man out near
the Hun wire. Word was passed along the
line, and hopped over to bring in the
supposed casualty. Before his astounded
mates could grasp his intention he had dis-
appeared over the enemy parapet. No doubt
the information he gave the Germans was
responsible for a heavy bombardment on our
sector with a big casualty list. The deserter
was later reported as a “prisoner of Avar
at Ruhleben. A hostile demonstration was
made at his parents’ residence when tin-
truth reached his M.L. home town, and
police protection was sought and granted.
* * * *
“Coot”: Re the grotesque origin of the
names of some Australian towns (B.
00/7/’25). Barpinba (Vic.) was formerly
known as Weering. For some reason or
other it decided on a new. handle, and three
local Bumbles, Barnard, Pink and Bath,
were appointed a committee of selection.
The opening letters of their three names
supplied the town with its new appellation.
Tempy (Vic.) was originally a temporary
siding between Speed and Ouyen. In rail-
way-bills the word “Temporary” was abbre-
viated to “Tempy,” and Tempy it remains,
liemlaw, near Horsham (Vic.), Avas obtained
bv reversing the name of the adjacent pas-
toral station, “Walmer.” Kinnabulla (Vic.)
was a station on which wild cattle were
troublesome. Unapproachable in daytime,
they were occasionally shot at night when
coming to drink. The blacks were given part
of the meat obtained. When hungry they
would ask Laver, the manager, to go out and
“Kin-na-bulla” (kill a bullock). The word
Avas adopted by him as a brand for his wool-
and later was applied to the town-
ship.
* * * *
“Caractacus”: In the forefront of Fleet
festivities in Melbourne was a well-worn
flivver Avith grey-bearded Dad at the wheel
and a tonneau loaded to the gunwales with
gobs—a different party each day and trip.
The driver sometimes had a grey-haired Mum
beside him on the front seat, but there was
always the tonneau-full of visitors, ratings
all. The host was a retired farmer, who had
placed his suburban villa as Avell as his Lin
at the disposal of America. The old couple

Through Sydney Heads in spray,
With flutt’ring Stars and Stripes a-stream.
“How’s this for U.S.A.?”

Six thousand miles away.
I glimpsed a bunch of admirals
And other high grandees;
They whirled them off to stately halls
From packed and cheering quays
To pay their ceremonious calls
On our authorities.
Long line on line, in brave array,
I saw the Jackies swing;
The quivering arches seemed to say
The whirring ’planes to sing
As welcome, one and all. were thi y

“Tarago”: Is 50 miles anythipg like a
record for reading a Morse lamp? On the
night of July 25 1 Avas walking along a coun-
try road 50 miles from Melbourne, Avlien I
noticed the reflection of a Morse lamp, pre-
sumably from one of the American ships in
Hobson’s Bay, playing on a light film of cloud
under a blurred moon. At first I thought it
was someone amusing himself, but the con-
glomeration of letters interested me, and pre-
sently I picked up the word “Mississippi” at
the conclusion of the message. Whether the
operator had been broadcasting his home
address or his floating one I don’t know, but
Mississippi would have been a formidable
word for us recruits to send on the obsolete
shutter-lamps that Ave used for practice at
Broadmeadows camp in 1915.
* * * *
“Lomara”: A feature about the U.S.
warships that impressed itself on many
visitors (particularly Avomen) was the
way in which the men are victualled
and served with meals. On British as well
as Japanese Avarships seen recently in Aus-
tralia messing arrangements for the loAver
deck were primitive in the extreme. The
Americans had properly “laid” tables with
delf tableAvare, correct accompaniments in
the Avay of condiment, cruets and cutlery, and
food prepared with obvious care. In regard
to sleeping accommodation, too, the old tradi-
tion that the seaman should live hard, enjoy
plenty of rope’s end and die Avith a sense of
release from suffering, is not upheld. The
bunks were stuffed and “sprung” as comfort-
ably as though ratings were guests in a good
hotel.
QUITS.
“I got even with Millicent- —the cat! —for
saying I was a frump.”
“How did you, manage it?”
“I chose her new hat!”
“Hasen”: Red-faced and angry. Mrs.
South Subbubs stood by the rail, one of the
Government guests on the good ship Wee-
roona, which did not sail from Port Mel-
bourne to welcome the Fleet. Very hotly
she advocated measures of dealing with the
recalcitrant firemen that would have turned
a Grand Inquisitor green with envy. Sud-
denly a great light seemed to dawn upon her.
She snatched excitedly at her companion’s
arm. “Do you know,” she said, “I believe
it’s all that woman Dobson’s doings. I do,
indeed. You see, I knew she was trying
heavens-hard to get an invitation for this.
Of course, my dear, she didn’t get it. So I
just called around yesterday to let her knoAv
I had one. She pretended that she didn’t
mind; awful cat she is. But I remember
noAV that her husband works for a shipping
company. Don’t you see, dear? She told
me once that he’d met that man Walsh

that they’re going to execute or something.

eyes of Mrs. Subbubs flashed as she pre-
sumably pictured some particularly boiling
oil for that Dobson woman.
* * * *
“Percy Pawnticket”: The disadvantages of
being too obliging were stressed by a Mel-
bourne man in a recent court case. His story
was that he took the best room in a subur-
ban boarding-house for two and a half
guineas a week. When a busy period en-
sued he occupied a smaller room in order
to allow the landlady, who had just been
widowed, to subdivide his old bedroom. But
lm still paid the 2A guineas without a mur-
mur ; and subsequently, when the landlady
began to sit up and take notice of handsome
males again, he obliged by becoming her
husband. This enabled her to let his room,
while he still paid the 2A guineas as his con-
tribution to the household expenses. By
and bye, however, the lady received a tempt-
ing offer for the nuptial chamber, and trans-
ferred herself to a single room and her lord
to a makeshift bed in the wash-house. Being
an obliging man, he fell in with the new
arrangement; his first real kick came when
in the cold weather he was deprived of blan-
kets for the benefit of other boarders. At
this stage he deserted his wife, and was sued
for maintenance. That was his story; his
wife only amended it in one word, declaring
that wherever he had used the word “paid”
he ought to have said “owed.” She further
added that he had borrowed a lot of money
from her and refused to work. Still, even
a worm of that sort might turn on being
relegated to the wash-house and deprived
of blankets after imagining that he had made
himself comfortable for life by marrying a
substantial boarding-house.
* * * *
“Hasen” : Melbourne papers are occasion-
ally quaintly humorless (or, perhaps, unwit-
tingly humorous), but never more so than
when explaining the American language to
artless Australians. Before me now are two
full columns of such translations. A glossary
in heavy tyDe gravely interprets the meaning
of “guy, mutt, nifty, grip, punk, slick, rube,
greenhorn, gas-buggy,” and the like—this :n
a land so flooded with cheap American litera-
ture and American pictures (often cheaper
still) that its more idiotic and parrot-minded
youth may be heard proclaiming that it was
“some” dance that it had taken its “jazz-
baby” to, and they’d had a “hot-dog” supper
after it. But most naive of all are some of
the definitions by the writer of those columns.
For “mutt” he gives, as the equivalent in
good Australian, “a dumb person.” Now
“dumb” in the sense of dull, stupid, is more
American than oil-scandals, monkey-trials,
bobbed-hair bandits and bootleggers. Nor
has this country the smallest right to claim
a patent for “lounge-lizard,” which is ad-
vanced as Australianese for the Yank “cake-
eater.” Seemingly, lectures for Australians
on the Australian language may soon be a
necessity.
* * •* *
“Bill Bowyang”: Bomance may lurk in an
empty beer-bottle. Years back a young lady
penned a few lines and enclosed them in one
of these homely receptacles, which she threw
overboard when the s.s. Cintra was passing
through the Whitsunday Passage. The
bottle drifted ashore at the mouth of the
Proserpine River, Avhere it Avas found by a
young sugar-grower who was fishing in the
vicinity. He got in touch with the writer,
and the correspondence ended in matrimony.
When the s.s. Ceramic,'with the 18th Batt.
on board, Avas passing Adelaide in 1915 a
Digger scribbled his name and unit on paper
and consigned it to the waves enclosed in a
dead marine. The bottle was picked up near
Esperance, and eventually fell into the hands
of an Albany (W.A.) lady who was inter-
ested in Red Cross work. She sent a few
lines overseas, and they found the Digger
in the 19th General Hospital in Alexandria.
He had just arrived, badly wounded, from
Gallipoli. Invalided back to Australia, he
pursued the acquaintance, and Cupid scored
another Avin. I have a photograph of the
happy couple and their two children.
* * * *
“Ancient Mariner” : “Alwvn” is wrong in
his statement (B. 23/7/’25) that one of the
three sons of Captain Cook “went to sea and
Avas never heard of again.” The first of the
three to go was a 16-year-old midshipman on
the battleship Thunderer; he was drowned
when that vessel foundered in a West Indian
hurricane in 17S0. A second son died of fever
at Cambridge in 1793. Six weeks later the
oldest of the trio (to whom “Alwyn” presum-
ably refers), when in command of H.M.S.
Spitfire, Avas drowned off the town of Poole,
alo#g with the whole of his boat’s crew 7 , when
attempting to board his ship in a gale. His
body was recovered and buried along-
side that of his brother in the church of St.
Andrew’s, Cambridge. By the way, it was
the ships Resolution and Discovery that car-
ried to England the news of Cook’s tragic
fate at Hawaii; the Endeavor had been sold
out of the Navy years before to become a
collier in the North Sea.
* * * *
“Six and Eight”: I remember another
Bathurst bride who renegged at the last
moment (B. 23/7/’25). Still, perhaps, there
w r as some warrant. When the pair arrived
at the church they were met by a woman
carrying an infant. She alleged that the
bridegroom was the father, and insisted on
presenting the child to the bride. The latter
lost no time in deciding to go back to mother,
and, hoisting blue Peter, made for home.
Thereupon the bridegroom, yielding either to
the parson’s exhortations or to a fit of pique,
led to the altar the lady who had supplied the
just impediment to the union previously pro-
jected.
* * # #
“Apariti”: The official hunt for M.L.
Diggers with German names took place be-
fore the Somme affair (B. 9/7/’25). The
cause of it was the desertion of a traitor
from Armentieres at the end of June.
Very soon after the Germans shelled several
H.Q. “possies,” including tAvo artillery bri-
gades and the Ist Field Ambulance. Rightly
or wrongly, we all believed this to be due to
information supplied by the deserter. Then
came the hunt—partly ludicrous, partly seri-
ous. I remember one of our company, a red-
headed talker with a good Scots name, inform-
ing some of us (in strict confidence, I don’t
think) that his mother was of German origin.
His satisfaction was poorlv-concealed when
he received his marching orders for England.
There accompanied him, A 7 ery unwillingly, a
slow-going, middle-aged Digger, with nothing
against him but a name made famous in
the “Pickwick Papers.” Him I found in ’l7
acting as offsider to a padre in an English
camp in England, and exceedingly anxious
to get back to France. Most of the combed-
out were brought back in ’l7. One case sticks
in my mind—that of a decent lad with an
undoubted German name who was returned
in time to hop over the top at Passchendaelc
and meet his death in the mud.
* * * *
“Percy Pawnticket” : There was a varia-
tion of the old lodger story when the gent,
of a couple who were lodging in the house
of friends bolted with the lady of the house,
leaving his own family as a sort of exchange.
There were two children; but the house-
holder appears to have shouldered the
burden manfully, and he and the forsaken
wife made the best of things for several
years. Then the levanter returned by him-
self, the woman having died, and put in the
startling request to be allowed to become a
lodger again. His wife of years before
regarded it as reasonable, backing it with
the specious argument that a father had a
right to be near his children, but the negoti-
ations were suddenly embittered by the re-
turned gent.’s claim that the furniture was
his —it had been the property of the woman
who eloped with him and she had made a
will in his favor. This was the last straw
where the householder was concerned; he
sold up the sticks and told the woman with
whom he had been living that if she wanted
her old husband back she could find a new
home for him. The other man actually had
the hardihood to bring an action for the
recovery of the goods, but the magistrate dis-
missed the claim with some cynical remarks.
* * * *
“Quiz”: Nautical superstitions may
weaken (B. 23/7/’25), but there are others
besides sailors who have a strong objection
to voyaging with a corpse. One of the
victims in the wreck of the Waira-
rapa on Great Barrier Island, M.L.,
was buried there. Several months later
the remains were exhumed and _ con-
signed to Melbourne for re-interment in the
steamer Tahine. Scared on learning that
they were travelling with a corpse, three
passengers left the Tahine at Hobart, and,
proceeding by rail to Launceston, completed
their journey to Melbourne on the steamer
Pateena, which arrived 10 hours after the
Tahine. Where the irony of Fate came in
was that the Pateena also chanced to have
a corpse snugly stowed below. But the
superstitious trippers didn’t know that.

“Runa”: The prejudice against the opal
(B. 16/7/’25) dies hard. Our small typiste
arrived one morning and delightedly informed
the office that an uncle had sent the family

to be set in rings and brooches, with a special

a small bottle, and asked my opinion of the
best manner of disposing of its contents. I
examined the collection and advised here
where to try to sell them, but she didn’t want
to do that —her idea was to get rid of them
by loss or destruction. Ever since their
arrival there had been trouble in the house —
a sick child, a fire in a bedroom, the bank-
ruptcy of a small concern in which her father
was interested, and a quarrel with her boy.
As all this had occurred in one week the
family declined to risk another day with the
stones in the house. Together we solemnly
dropped them one by one down a cesspit, and
doubtless some day someone will report an
opal find in an entirely unexpected locality.
I believe the uncle was told that the stones
had been stolen. The family, by the way,
insisted on a disposal that would not transfer
the curse to anyone else.
THE HUCKSTERBY VIEW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
"Albert Huckerby, representing 'all the employees
in the theatrical industry in Australia,’ told the
Tariff Board that he was opposed to any restriction
on importation of films and also to any increase in
tiie duty. The showman should have a free hand to
give his patrons what they wanted, wherever it came
from. He was an Australian and interested in
Australian national life, but no sentiment—business
for him.”
He loves his country right enough, and makes his
money out of her,
But mingled with affection warm he sometimes feels
a doubt of her.
Australian films might fail to please the fans, and
where’d his tucker be
In that deplorable event? No sentiment for
Huckerby!
The tastes long fed on Hollywood and slapstick puer-
ility
Might turn from local quip and jest with something
like hostility.
In Yankee terminology the showman would a “sucker”
be
Who filled the trough with cleaner fare—no senti-
ment for Huckerby.
Why, when they’re paying cheerfully for custard
pie banality,
For cowboy asininity and muddy sexuality,
Why monkey with Australian plays? The project
might a mucker be
For rash experimentalists—no sentiment for Huekcrby.

The final div. was at the rate of S p.c. p.a.;
the interim div. was a point less, making
7 1 p.c. for the year. The management’s
recommendation of. the advance indicates
its confidence that it can be maintained.
Capital is now £1,840,000. To meet the
£958,307 of inscribed deposits exchanged for
ordinaries, 638,872 fully-paids were issued,
and, to round off the ragged edges, 1128 new
shares were issued and sold on the market.
The operation lias reduced inscribed deposits
to £244,079. Although the transaction was
not finalised until near the close of the
financial year, it had been provided that
interest on the converted stock should cease
on December 31 and the shares allotted in
exchange participate in the div. for the
second half of the year. The consequence
is expressed in the larger distribution, which
is offset, however, by a lessened interest on
the inscribed deposits—£29,3sB compared
with £50,230 for 1924. The declared inten-
tion was “to give holders an opportunity of.
sharing in the future prosperity of the
bank.” The fact that they were permitted
to realise at a very fair price was a strong
incentive. Two fully-paid £1 shares were
exchanged for £3 of inscribed deposits, and,
as prices before the announcement were
stock, 13s. 9d., shares, 255. 104 d., it meant
that the offer, from the market viewpoint,
was equal to 51s. 9d. for 41s. 3d. The profit
disclosed for the twelvemonth does not in-
clude £lO,OOO taken (as in past years)
to write down the book value _ of pre-
mises. So that, apart from the visible addi-
tions to reserves on the year from the con-
version, the premiums on the new shares
sold on the market, and tlie amount
added from net profits, the directors are not
neglecting the internal strength of the bank.
Even now shareholders are not receiving as
good a div. as those distributed by other
Australasian hanks, but the Board is doing
the correct tiling in consolidating the posi-
tion of the institution before lifting it. Bast
year’s profit was equal to 9.2 p.c. on capital
as at June 30. Over the past six years an
average of £48,050 has been added to re-
serves from profits, and if tlie intention is
to maintain that, profits will have to increase
before the div. rate will be further advanced,
oven though they now are sufficient to permit
of a slight increase. Of course, with re-
serves of £794,560. the position is somewhat
different from that of preceding years. But
the outlook is promising and at least 8 p.c.
seems assured- —circumstances which have
not passed unnoticed by the market.
Care and keenness in management and
insistence on attention to reserves rather
than to divs. have brought the A.B.C. to
a comfortable position. It was the old Aus-
tralian. Joint Stock Bank to 1910, and of its
career since the reconstruction most of the
progress has been in the years following the
purchase of tlie City Bank of Sydney, in 1918.
That absorption helped to widen the busi-
ness connection; it added an immediate 2*j
millions of deposits, and has influenced later
business. Here is disclosed one phase of the
expansion : „

In comparisons antecedent to last year the
inscribed deposits, ranging from li millions
upward should be included in total funds:
for instance, the bank was holding in 1921
less than £4 of the public's money to each
£1 of its own. On June 30 the amount was
£4 6s. 5d.. so that there is room to extend
its lending connection by a considerable
amount. . *

The return to gold exchange makes the in-
crease in hills on London of less moment
than when the growing accumulations at
that centre were a cause for anxiety to Aus-
tralian bankers. The liquid assets are equal
to 9s. 4d. for each £1 of outside liabilities,
and that is almost 7 p.c. more than is usu-
ally considered adequate.

It was a fat year, yet, if the profit was no
more than they say it was, not as fat as it
should have been. Of course, there was a
substantial carry-0ver —14,956 hales com-
pared with 1455 of the previous year—but
the quantity received was 72.235 bales, an
increase of 15,257, so that sales were greater,
and the higher values should have meant
a larger net return. Gross earnings moved
up from £90,757 to £98,572 ; and it is more
than likely that the management took advant-
age of the rich patch to put a bit by for
the lean ones that lie ahead. The influence
of the postponed sales is very obvious: there
was a jump in advances, etc., of 120 p.c.
Here are the movements for the year and a
comparison hack to 1915: —

During the year the co. bought a Dubbo
property; it consists of 18 acres with sheds
and railway siding, and already has been
used as a stock-spelling depot and so on.
Regular sales of stock are to commence
there shortly. An area of 13 acres at Wal-
langarra (Q. border) was also acquired to
house and rest rams in transit to Queens-
land. The value of these purchases will be
apparent to clients when equipment has
been completed. Meantime the Board re-
ports satisfactory progress in its various de-
partments.
The compulsory change, in title isn’t likely
to hurt business. The concern has more
than a quarter-century of trading behind it,
arid its activities and the semi co-operative
lines on which the business is conducted are
well known among pastoralists: clients get
cash rebates, last year’s being 25 p.c. of com-
missions charged on wool sales and 10 p.c.
of the charges on produce and livestock in
each case 5 p.c. less than 1924: the Board,
judging that clients wouldn’t object to the
reduction in view of their own rich returns,
probably decided that it was a good time to
add a little strength here and there. heed-
less to say, with the property purchases and
customers seeking support, the co. itself had
to lean on outsiders pretty heavily. Still
the position was comfortable enough : there
was more than sufficient in the cash, Gov-
ernment stock and advances to cover the
floating debt. Even allowing for the lesser
prices for wool the current year should be
very successful. The present profs., by the
wav, become ordinaries at the close of the
current term. They have all had the same
S p.c. p.a. during the past four years, during
which a shade over £lll,OOO has been added
to visible reserves —just about half as much
as lias been divided.

Ten years ago H. H. Massie took over the
general manager’s chair which T. A. Bibbs
had occupied for just on half a century.
Now Massie has retired and J. R. Dry hurst
has moved into the vacant place, lie will
find the bank even stronger than when 1.
A. Dibbs relinquished the reins, although,
like liis predecessor, he takes control at a
period when conditions throughout the world
are far from normal. A financial Gibraltar
like the Commercial of Sydney is in a posi-
tion to meet almost any known shock with-
out visible effect. In the stormy nineties
the bank jettisoned no capital; and expan-
sion has been steady throughout, as capital
movements show: —

Chairman George Judah Cohen usually lias
a few wise words to say at annual meetings,
but in his latest deliverance, beyond urging
support for the Commonwealth conversion
loan, lie confined himself to dealing with the
balance-sheet figures which, compared with
the preceding year, showed some substantial
movements: —

Premises, etc.. . 568,253 955,000 950,000
Deposits increased by £3,336,78(1, but portion
of that expansion is looked upon as temporary.
Liquid assets were £3,188,947 greater on the
year, money at short call contributing
£2 815 000 of the increase, while public secu-
rities were less by £496,460. Bills receivable
were £1,725,757 higher, reflecting the recent
activity in exports. Premises were £5OOO
lower on the year, and the Board states that,
despite considerable outlay in recent years,
including the completion of the main edifice
in Sydney, the policy of “substantially writ-
ing down the book values” was continued.
Shareholders were informed that in addition
to the reduction in premises account full pro-
vision was made for all probable losses and
contingencies. The record profit disclosed
was equal to 13.7 p.c. on capital, although
the dimensions of reserves make the return
on visible funds less than 74 p.c. The posi-
tion is very solid: in addition to the large
proportion ' held liquid there is additional
strength in the ratio of the bank’s own
money to that of creditors; £1 to to. As
f 1 to £8 is generally accepted as quite safe the
management is in ‘the position to help cus-
tomers to the extent of a few millions with-
out unduly affecting the proportions. Tim
£18,078,672 of deposits and other liabilities
not covered by liquid assets were protected bj
written-down premises and advances with a
total book value of £24,673,899, so that over
5s in the £ of the value of the securities
could disappear as well as all the inner re-
serves before creditors would be endangered
to the extent of a shilling. There were
rumors in the latter half of the year of a
further issue of capital, but the balance-sheet
discloses no necessity for an increase, no,
has there been anything to warrant the whis-
per that the Australian Bank of Commerce
was to be absorbed.

About three years ago a coal-bearing area
near Mt. Kernbla was taken up. I here
is a chance of it proving more successful
than seemed likely at the time. The cross-
country line from Moss Vale to Wollongong,
if construction is proceeded with, will
pass through the property, so the Illawarra
colliery, when developed, will start oft with
some advantages. But it is going to make
trouble before that stage is reached. Ex-
ploration work was continued last vear, and
unforeseen difficulties rendered the work
slow and costly. It is to be hoped more
favorable conditions will develop, for coke
making is being carried on chiefly for the
debenture-holders and the workers. The
debentures fell due this year, but arrange-
ments have been made for an extension for
five years as from June 6 last. The original
debenture debt (£40.000) represented assist-
ance given by Mt. Morgan as a considera-
tion for a favorable coke contract: the
advance has been reduced to £13,000 by
annual cuts of £3OOO. The coke plant is
alongside Coalcliff colliery, on the N.S.W.
South Coast, from which it obtains its small
coal by conveyor-belt. There has been no
thing in it thus far. Divs. on the prefs.
accumulated until 1918 and ords. had to wait
for the seventh year before their div. came
along—6 p.c. Fear of what the financial
filibusters of the State party might
do moved the co. to a reconstruction, and a
100 p.c. issue of gift scrip in 1920. Thus
the subsequent 4 p.c. divs. were really worth
8 p.c., but, even so, the average return is less
than 2 p.c. on original capital. It has been
n discouraging proposition, and it needs no
Sherlock Holmes to reach a principal cause
- -labor troubles. The lethargy at Mt. Mor-
gan owing to the deadness of copper, lias also
been a factor of importance.

Some substantial writing-up was done in
1920- works by £50,000 and leaseholds by
about £9OOO. while goodwill was taken in at
£lOOO. But inasmuch as certain of the co s
rights have less than 10 years to run. the
Board has had to get out the shears, and last
vear £lOOO came off the leasehold and the
coke-ovens and buildings. Meantime neither
prefs. nor ords. have had a div. for three
years, and prospects in the coke section are
not bright. Liabilities, apart from the de-
benture debt, amounted on March 31 to
£6036- against that there were cash and
stocks,’ £7665. The £lO,OOO of prefs. were
secured by net tangibles with a book value
of £127,556. But on March 31 next there
will be ’ accrued divs. amounting to £3200,
and it is from that viewpoint the market
forms an opinion of the scrip.

for distribution. The div. absorbed £2387,
the undistributed balance being sent forward
to next accounts. Even the magic of the
Burns-Philp touch cannot transmute every-
thing into gold. Shortland was started in
1914. _ Labor scarcity was a difficulty which
early interfered with plans, and only a por-
tion of the area was planted. The long wait
for the palms to reach bearing was rewarded
by a bad market for copra, but prices have
been improving, and the outlook is brighter.
Whether there will be anything sweet in it for
shareholders is difficult to say. Only a frac-
tion of the estates has been planted, which
is against big returns, although the relation-
ship with 8.-P. is sure to be of assistance.
In 1924 the Board decided against any
further outlay on development, and £13,931
was struck off plantations, leaving the book
value of assets equal to paid capital.

Whenever Yilgarn (W.A.) bucks up a little
someone re-pegs portion of Fraser’s old
group at Southern Cross. This time a local
syndicate has taken up an area and is urg-
ing Adelaide to supply it with capital.
Fraser’s, as The Bulletin has stated again
and again, paid divs. on a small capital for
years and was a good show down to 400 ft.
Then values diminished and nobody has made
money out of it since. With ample capital,
which isn’t likely to be provided in tin;
present instance, Fraser’s might have a
chance at depth.

McCahon’s Gold Mines, N.L. (W.A.), has
taken an option at Westonia on the strength
of a report that a new shoot of gold has
been located in portion of the old Edna
May group. For some time past yarns have
been told of big tonnages of payable ore left
behind in the drowned and half-drowned
workings of this derelict property, but so far
as this Column remembers this is the first
time that one has been spread about a new
shoot. 4 Like almost everything else in the
West it has been “favorably reported on,”
but so far the market hasn’t responded.
* * * *
Almost forgotten Central and West Boul-
der (W.A.) narrowly escaped forfeiture the
other day, It had been sold with plant
thereon to a machinery firm, and while the
transfer was being put through operations
were suspended and the jumper stepped in.
After weighing the matter the warden de-
cided that a £25 fine Would meet the case.
At one time Central and West Boulder Co.
was considered to have great prospects; but
although its holding, which was wedged be-
tween the Lake View and Associated at Kal-
goorlie, pi-oduced a fair quantity of gold,
shareholders never got.any of it and, when
production fell off, the co. shifted camp to a
Nigerian tinfiehl. It is still operating there.
* * * *
In 1924 Great Boulder Proprietary
(W.A.) made a profit of £42,573, and, with
£4933 balance brought forward, had £47,507
available, which taxes reduced to £26,470.
After writing off various sums and transfer-
ring £ll,OOO to reserves, £12,549 remained.
The co. put 111,514 tons of ore through its
mills for 75,7070 z. valued at £275.919, an
average of 11.64dwt., which is a shade under
the average grade of the ore now in sight. Since
1895 Great Boulder has crushed 3,698,215
tons for 3,783,0470 z., worth £13.451,216. It
has earned about 71 millions profit and dis-
tributed six millions among shareholders.
Nothing was paid last year. Estimated gross
value of ore reserves at December 31, 1924,
was £346,000’; this represents roughly Is.
per share profit, and cash assets are reckoned
to be worth about another Is. per share. The
report contains one bright spot: the directors
reduced their large fees from £3459 with
income-tax paid, to £l5OO. And, considering
the small profits, that is quite enough.
Keeley Silver Mines, Ltd., in which the
two Associateds are largely interested, held
a meeting in Toronto last month The co.’s
chief spokesman, Dr. Mackintosh Bell, em-
phasised the point that during the past year
the management had concentrated upon open-
ing up new ground rather than blocking out
ore in known country. He described the phy-
sical conditions of the show as “excellent”
and hinted that a long dividend-paying exist-
ence was ahead of it.
* * * *
Wiluna (W.A.) reports the intersection of
the lode at 300 ft. in Gwalia Consolidated,
but so far nothing has been said about
values, which appears ominous. Where struck
by the bore the lode was reckoned to be worth
from £2 to £4O-odd per ton, and on the
strength of this the Wiluna Development
Syndicate was hurriedly formed in London
to acquire A. H. Collier’s option on the pro-
perty. Several Kalgoorlie cos. hold shares in
this concern.

The extinction of Victoria’s gold-mining
industry is in sight. ‘ The yield for June was
38560 z., or 25810 z. less .than for June, 1924.
Total production for the six months was
15,7040 z. less than in the same period of
last year, totalling only 21,7620 z. The
largest quantity of gold produced in any one
year was 3,053,7440 z. Since 1851 Victoria
has raised gold worth £302,165,000. The
yield has been on the* down grade since 1906.
Golden Lily is still frozen up on the other
side of Walhalla (Vic.). D. Welch, sick
of the place, has handed over to H. Jones
from Mathinna. Local cockies do not fancy
the heavy carting over the mountain roads
to the mine, and the battery is half hung, so
it will not move before September. _ The
co. has 580 tons at grass, which will be
eaten up in a mouth, but by the time the
stamps fall the bottom tunnel will be con-
nected with No. 2 and allow proper ventila-
tion and stoping. The rise between the two
levels carried 4ft. of oz. stone for 70ft. from
the lower tunnel up, the length of the gold
shoot there being about 200 ft. Tonnage proved
is small, but the Cabbage Garden always
works on insignificant proved ore reserves,
generally bucking shares to an extreme level
at the mere mention of a div. That is the
danger over Golden Lily.

The old Cornish was responsible for the
second advent of Daylesford. It is being
re-opened by “Bill” Plain’s followers. The
move is a somewhat forlorn hope, but geolo-
gist Whitelaw urges them to go for the old
Crown shoot at shallow depths, and, as. Plain
is a whale at following a good geologist, he
has rounded up his supporters. A promising
run of stone, cut off the 250 ft. level at 370 ft.
from the shaft, turns out to be a little
stranger, so further cross-cutting has still
to be done for the Crown. The new shoot
is 15ft. wide, and carried just about enough
gold to string the manager on if he had not
the nerve to think that it is better to go
for fresh victories in virgin territory to the
south. The attraction there is that the
slates are far more promising than to the
north. Anvthing here or on the Crown reef,
which is thought to be only 30ft. ahead of
the face of the cross-cut, would stiffen up
Daylesford mining.

It has taken 12 months’ campaigning for
Collins House to find out that the Cocks
Pioneer dredge got too far down the lead
when it started upon the new ground there.
The trial run was a disappointment. Run
41 from the centre of the gutter was much
more promising, as 170.000 cub. yds. aver-
aged lOld. a yd., or 4d. better than the first
go. Hugh Falconer then turned his plant
up-stream, and did well out of the 30ft,. floor
of drift, getting as high as 4oz. gold with
every cwt. of tin. The 50ft. floor also was
better, but the 70ft. floor duffered owing to
the presence of a big mulloeky formation.
Now Falconer is on to No. 43 run, and has
sent 100.000 cub. yds. through the plant.
So far the whole three floors are shaping
well, and the belief is that mullock at the
bottom is cutting out. If so the next pad-
dock, 650 ft. higher up the creek, should see
a 10 per cent, better efficiency from the plant.
In the last six months the plant has put
through 391,000 cub. yds. for 25570 z. gold
and 34 tons tin oxide. The average works
out at 9.67 d., or double that for the previous
campaign. With a reduced output, the work-
ing account about balanced for the six
months, but interest and head-office charges
made for a loss of £lO7B. Overdraft stands
at £19,290, and there is a little sum of
£1916 due to sundry creditors. Liquid
assets have shrunk, but they still amount to
£12,500.
The Wallaby is limping along at Gaff-
ney’s Creek (Vic.), but when tlie main
rise gets up to the shaft workings it is
expected to improve. Anvway, the Minos
Department has supplied £5OO, which should
assist it along. Two runs of ore have been
cut in the rise from the low-level tunnel, one,
of which is said to be ounce stone. Things
will boom if only there is enough of the
good stuff. A lot of the Spur workings have
been opened up and drained, and a shot is
to be made to test if stone left there by the
old miner is payable. As a rule, he was not
such a fool as to give openings in that direc-
tion; but there is always the chance in the
mountains that he was less keen than else-
where. The next half-year will show how
matters stand with the co.
* * * *
Gold and mica are engaging prospectors’
attention on the old Fids void field (Q.),
which formerly produced a respectable ton-
nage of gold ore and then faded out. The
Cumberland mine is showing gold freely, and
a couple of other leases have been pegged
out on prospects. Further out of town, a
promising mica outcrop is being opened up.
The lode is up to 20ft. wide, the color is
white, and sheets up to 12in. across have
been found. As the surface mineral is
rather weathered, the prospectors have been
advised to put a couple of shafts down about
50ft. to secure samples of fresh mica. Indi-
cations point to the existence of mica of
commercial quality.
* * * *
The Palmer River (N.Q.), with the
glamor of the old alluvial days still surround-
ing it, is for the first time in its history to
be systematically shafted, pitted and bored.
The nature of its bottom will be ascertained
and the values of the wash estimated. Walter
Baker, g.m. of the Palmer River Gold Co.,
is on the co.’s 600-acre area, and on his
report will depend whether a dredge is set
to work.
The Empire mill, erected last year, with
Government assistance, on the Mt. Coolon
field (Q.), has crushed 100 tons of ore from
the Kangaroo mine for a yield over the plates
of 7dwt. The plant is now cold waiting for
more ore to crush. Where tnis is to come
from no one seems to know, for the only two
mines working at present, the Native Bear
and the Mt. Coolon, treat their ore them-
selves. When the mill was being put up this
page remarked on the diversity of opinion as
to whether it was needed. It is well known
that the Mines Inspector and the Government
Geologist, who visited the field to report on
its advisability, were unfavorable on account
of there being no prospect of sufficient ore
supplies for a public battery. The local
Labor organisation was, however, a strong
supporter, and financial assistance was given
to the mill proprietors. They now have
ample time to cogitate in the spells between
crushings.
* # * *
Development work on the Night (lower lode,
Chillagoe (N.Q.), is practically at a stand-
still! The Argentum, •which is held by a
Chillagoe eo., looked promising last year, but
recent work has disappointed and cash has
run out. The show is hampered, too, by
being nearly 30 miles by road from the
railway and smelters. In addition, the ore
carries zinc and a small quantity of antimony.
On present prospects the outlook is not
bright.
* # # *
Unable to drain the Gympie (Q.) field
any longer, No. 4 North Phoenix has closed,
and manager Jim Brown is out of a job
after his record reign of 43 years. The mine
]trodiiced 128,5560 z. from 85,191 tons, worth
£471,373: and the 40,000 shares participated
in £218,667 worth of divs. The show had
its lean periods which sometimes held out
for years, but gold percentages were heavy
when the reefs came up against the black
slate floors. The record crushing was cleaned
up in June three years ago, when 126 tons
gave 33580 z., and paid a ss. div. on the sur-
viving 34.287 shares, the disbursement being
£8571. Recent crushings came from the
784 ft. level, the last being 48 tons for 160 oz.

“R. 8.”: Remarks on Mt. Mulligan (B.
16/7/’25) would be fairer if they stated
Mulligan’s beginning under private enter-
prise. That private-enterprise management
is not to be condemned because it ate up a
co.’s capital and then £90.000 of Government
advances; but that public ownership suc-
ceeded to that loss and its difficulties re-
quires re-stating.
* * * *
Official reticence is the most marked fea-
ture nowadays surrounding operations at
Belimbla Creek. Ncrrigundah (N.S.W.). The
co. is in 150,000 2s. shares, of which 90,000
are contribs., fully called up. In November
chairman Charles Napier issued a circular
to shareholders informing them that early
prospects were so bright that, in addition
to the 10-head battery, an additional 5-head
was in course of erection “to treat separately
a remarkably rich mineralised vein running
into the main lode.” He considered that
“excellent work had been done in speedy
opening up, erecting substantial machinery
and getting into full swing with such a
limited working capital as £9000.” Further,
Napier opined that “when crushing begins
in the new year, there should be a steady
output of gold insuring good returns which
will be available as dividends.” The same
document bore a progress report by Rev.
Joseph Campbell, M.E., whose optimism re-
mained unabated. He told expectant share-
holders that:
Erection of the great battery is nearing com-
pletion, and crushing will commence in January. The
tunnel is in 450 ft., and will strike the lode when
driven another 400 ft. or 430 ft, I think we will cut
another good lode before it reaches its main objective,
the Great Gold Lode. There is plenty of good crush-
ing ore available, apart from the splendid ore which
the tunnel will enable us to break and deliver to
the battery at low cost. We are installing 15 head ;
but so great is the supnly of ore than 50 stamps can
easily be kept constantly going.
Campbell then spoke of the “ample means”
behind the co., his pride at what had been
done, and his further excess “when the
stamps begin to fall and the stream of gold
begins to run early in the New Year.” It
was after this stage that things tailed off
into silence. Months went by and the stream
of gold remained undetected. Then it was
announced that a crushing had been started
on April 15. After that the silence grew
more profound. Somebody mentioned “delay
by floods” in June. Perhaps there has been
a' clean up. The office says nothing about
that—or about anything else.

The Cooper stable in Hunter-street, Syd-
ney, has issued a prospectus for flotation of
Tan ami Gold Mines (N.T.). It provides
for 160,000 2s. 6d. shares, of which 64,000
paids and £l5OO cash absorb the Laurie-
Beckett interests in 60 acres, 80,000 con-
tribs. at 6d. down and 6d. on allotment are
offered for public subscription, and 16,000
contribs. are held in reserve. When regis-
tration has been effected. J. T. Beckett, late
Chief Inspector of Aborigines in the Terri-
tory, will proceed by motor-truck to the spot
and carry a reduction plant along with him.
Dr. 11. I. Jensen, the Queensland geologist,
states: “Tanami is one of the most promis-
ing goldfields in Australia lying neglected.”
The show certainly possesses good geological
backing.
* * * *
Bribbaree (N.S.W.) still finds most of
its gold in the boxes; the July run accounted
for 170 oz. retorted from 160 tons of stone.
The amalgam weighed 4630 z., of which 3500 z.
came out of the boxes, against 113 oz. off the
plates. Fortnightly quartz haulage con-
tinues at 80 tons, and cyanide vats are
about ready for the tailings. Tin* under-
ground reports of manager \Y. 11. Williams
are worded as though he trod on eggs.
•X- * *
Vegetable Creek, Ardlethau (N.S.W.),
crushed 598 tons for the July run, and got
6| tons concentrates. Poor-grade ore obtains
in the open cut, and the western pipe is still
refractory; but Smith’s workings are more
tractable. Here there is an improvement as
No. 2 pipe is sunk on, and No. 4 pipe is also
labelled good-grade ore.

Miss PRESTON STANLEY, the Ma State’s
firist woman M.L.A.
C. W. Grant, chairman of directors of the
Cascade Brewery, goes into the Senate in
place of George Matthew Foster, who used
to forget that he was a Tas. Senator except
on salary day. As Nationalist M.H.A. for
Denison, Grant helped to keep the Lyons
Government in office when it hadn't a Labor
majority, and the Laborites gave him their
votes in preference to ex-Premier Lee—there
was no Labor nominee, for once. Within
two years live ejected Senators (Bakhap,
Barker, E. D. Millen, McDougall, Russell)
and a stopgap (Power) have died, and an-
other elected person has resigned. When
Russell’s successor arrives a sixth of the
Senators will have been chosen by State
Parliaments—a thing that has not happened
before in the history of the House.
t "rn 16 a PP°^ n t Inen t of E. C. Magratli and J.
J. Tyrrell to the N. S. Wales Leg. Council
is a reward for their personal devotion to
Labor Premier Lang. Magrath, a hustler from
the JNorth of England, was a comp, in various
Sydney prmteries; then he became an organ-
isei tor the old Typographical Association,
and, when that body merged into the Print-
ing Industries Employees’ Union, was made
secretary. He succeeded A, C. Willis as
President of the A.L.P., and is the only man
with practical newspaper experience on the
Labor Daily directorate. Tyrrell, an A.L P
vice-president, doesn’t possess Magratii’s
but has more organising*
ability As secretary of the Municipal Em-
ployees Union, he is the power behind the
throne at Sydney Town Hall.
On appearances, no one would take Hugh
} ictor McKay, whose critical illness in
London is reported, for a captain of indus-
try. Heavy-featured, heavy-eyed, slow of
utterance, he suggests rather a staunch but
unimaginative farmer than an inventor of
agricultural implements and founder of the
Sunshine factory. Success never made Mc-
Kay his pleasant spouse anything but
guid Scots bodies; not even their transla-
tion to lordly Rupertswood—intended to be
the ancestral seat of the baronets Clarke
altered that. A brood of brothers helped to
establish the McKay enterprise, and cousins
nephews, in-laws ’ and long-held retainers
keep it very much a family concern.
_ ’ T ,\ Keynes, the economist, is to marry
Lydia Lopokova, the Russian dancer
Keynes is the super-adding machine who
represented the British Treasury at the
Peace Conference in 1919 and the Chancellor
ot the Exchequer on the Supreme Economic
Council. The key to his choice of a life-
partner is to be found in his clumsily-named
Economic Consequences of the Peace.” The
volume, a curious compost of abstruse cal-
culations and pen-pictures of the great little
men who decided the destinies of Europe for
thought they did) at Paris, reveals Keynes
and au emotionalist as well as an
infallible cash-register.
Dr. Anderson, Anglican Bishop of liiver-
ina, who resigned the other day, was conse-
crated m St. Paul’s, London, 30 years ago.
ln Devon, he came to Australia in
1882, and was ordained by Bishop Stanton
m Townsville (Q.). His successor in the
see is Canon Halse, head of the St. Barnabas
Brotherhood (N.Q.). Halse is the fifth Bush
Brother to be raised to the episcopacy the
Bishops of Carpentaria, Kalgoorlie, N.Q
and Rockhampton all bush-brothered before
they bished.
The passing of William Arthur Trenwith,
once a people’s tribune, at his Camberwell
(Vic.) home attracted little notice. For
3o years he. had been out of the spotlight
!t,ld tlie doings of the former bootmaker,
chieftain of the Trades Hall, leader of the
Parliamentary Labor party, apostle of Pro-
tection, Minister in two State Governments,
member of the Federal Convention and Sena-
tor, were forgotten or, only, vaguely remem-
bered. Trenwith incurred the enmity of offi-
cial Labor when he entered the Senate as an
independent 22 years ago, but there was no
real hostility.. among the rank and file till
he threw in his lot with Deakin’s party. His
defeat at the next general election brought
his political career to an end. Trenwith
was too good for the shelf. He was a giant
compared with some of the men Labor has
sent into Parliament since he left the State
Assembly in 1903. When there was a sub-
stantial bunch of notables in Vic. Parliament
between 1889 and 1901 his light was not
obscured. Only a few old political friends,
including Peacock, Bowser, Tom Gilchrist
(Clerk-Assistant of the Assembly) and
Henry. Tatnall (of Richmond) were at the
graveside at Brighton when a mound was
heaped over him; Labor stood aloof.
“Seebee” : Death has brought former Labor-
leader Trenwith again into the company of
the great Uiginbotham. When the big mari-
time strike in 1890 had been on for some
time Trenwith, Hancock and W. E. Murphy
VU? 1 '? the committee of finance and control,
rliginbotham, then C.J., had the courage to
send a donation of £5O to the triuhivifate
and to promise further donations as a pro-
test against the refusal of the employers to
confer with the men with the view of ending
the strife. Uiginbotham got. the call as the
year 1892 was ebbing away, and was laid to
rest m Brighton Cemetery. Trenwith has
claimed his little lot ill the same burying-
ground.
It is curious that the only two Russells to
become (senators should have arrived in Par-
I lament at the same time and died while
holding the job down, in each case with less
than 12 months to go. William Russell, of
South Aus., got in on Dec. 12, 1906, and
passed out on June 28, 1912; in the Vic-
torian E. J. Russell’s case Dec. 13.1919, was
thedate of his last election, and July 24,
1920, that of his death. They sat together
as Labontes in the third and fourth Com-
monwealth Parliaments, but were not related.
The passing of A. A. Austin, one of Vic.’s
sub-squatters, caused no surprise, as he had
been bedridden for months and had given
up his Upper House seat in June because
there was no hope of his ever occupying it
again if re-elected. He was in the Assem-
bly for 20 months (1902-04) before entering
the Plush Chamber (which suited him
better) 12 years ago. Larundel estate
(Elaine), Sinclair estate (Ileywood), Briton
estate (Stawell) and Rockbanks estate (Bal-
moral) were landed possessions. Sportsmen
remember him best as captain of the Geelong
premier football teams in 1879 and 1891. lie
is survived by a widow, three daughters and
two sons; like their dad the two sons are men
of flocks.
LOUIS ESSON, vers[?]maker and playwrigh t.
Sailed his last lugger, Captain Charles
Watson, the first Westralian to get a master's
certificate. Most of the pearling luggers now
working out of Broome punched their way
up from Fremantle under the old sailor.
When chief officer of a ship trading between
London and Australia he earned the Royal
Humane Society's medal and clasp for jump-
ing overboard after a shipmate. He was chief
officer of the schooner Adur, which took pro-
visions as far as Eucla for the Forrest Perth-
Adelaide expedition of 1870.
Two men of whom the Yank officers at the
Vic. State dinner took special notice were
John Monash and Justice Cussen. Monash
had a fascination for them; they recalled
that he commanded at Hamel on July 4,
1918, when a detachment of the 33rd U.S.
Division, fighting alongside the Aussies, had
their first taste of victory in France. And
Cussen interested them as a native-born
youth who was both an engineer and lawyer
before he became a judge. They liked his
personality, and his manner they considered
“just right.”
.Tames Simmons, Bathurst's last link
with the bad old days, passed over last week
after 92 years of it. He knew the west-
ern city when it hadn’t a road to its
credit; when, it was under martial law and
had its daily public hanging. Once he wit-
nessed the execution of eight convicts one
after the other. When Ben Hall and his
gang raided Bathurst, and again when the
first train steamed in, Simmons was on the
scene. Later he was Mayor and president
of the hospital, whose matron, Miss Hertzog,
he married when over 60.
A good Australian from Holland:—
Australian sheepmen have lost a good friend and a
wise tutor in E. D. Van Weenen. What the cheery
little Hollander did not know about the merino was
not worth knowing. Even late Sam McCaughey
deferred to his opinion in all matters relating to
the breeding of studs, and thousands of bush Aus-
tralians who had never spoken to him reverenced his
pen-name of “Lana.” Van Weenen came to Australia
about 1864, and served a long apprenticeship to
sheep-farming—mostly in the Liverpool Plains dis-
trict of N.S.W. —before the Inky Way claimed him
for its own. In his particular line of journalism
he has not been equalled, but he had many interests
outside it, notably philately. Some months ago his
house was burgled during his absence in the country,
and a large quantity of plate and other valuables
was stolen. Most of the plate was recovered by the
police, but the stamp-collection— reputed to have
been worth thousands of pounds—is still missing.
With tears in his big brown eyes, he lamented this
pieceof ill-luck to the writer. “Those other t’ings,”
he said in his quaintly confiding way, and with
his slightly foreign accent —“I do not .mind so rmieh
about dem. But my stamps—ah, damnablet” He
was in his eightieth year when fresh pastures called,
and had been working to within a week of his death.
■ The. four nominees of Melbourne ’Varsity
Council for passages to Europe are all men
who have headed their year. S. 11. Roberts
is a W.E.A. tutor who ha§ written a useful
reference-book on Australian land settle-
ment. He, like S. H. Heymanson, who goes
to London to seek a Ph.D., obtained a first
class in history. C. M. Tattam is a geologist
and top of his course for four successive
years. B. C. Fitzpatrick headed the lists in
philosophy and sociology in the B.A. exams,
at the beginning of the year. A Ph.D. is
his object, too.
Judged his last show, Donald F'orbes, known
all over Australia as a cattle expert. He
came from Scotland as an infant in 1851.
and learned his job from Robert McDougall
in Victoria. About 1880 he moved over to
S.A.. and had charge of the famous Angus
shorthorns for over 40 years. He acted as
judge all over the continent and in M.L..
and never missed a Sydney Show for half
a century. About a year ago he retired to
a farm in Westralia.
George Fairbairn, Vic.’s Agent-General,
lias obtained several months’ leave to enable
him to sail in November and arrive in Mel-
bourne a little before Christmas. “Urgent
private business” is given as the reason, but
it may be taken for granted that he also
wishes to escape the worst of the winter
season on the other side. Nearer 70 than
00, he felt the fogs, the bitter winds and
the other discomforts of the November-
February period of 1924-25 severely.
“Coot”: Adelaide’s River Torrens, as stated
(B. 80/7/’2o), was not named after tin
author of the Torrens Real Property Act.
but after Colonel Torrens, one of the pro-
prietors of the English Globe newspaper, and
chairman of the South Australian Land Com-
pany, which, promoted by Edward Gibbon
Wakefield, in 1832 submitted a suggested
Charter to the British Government for the
establishment of a South Australian settle
ment. The Charter was refused, but three
years later Torrens was appointed chairman
of the eight Commissioners authorised by the
British Ministry to establish such a settle-
ment ; these despatched Colonel Light in
1836 with a surveying staff and a few emi-
grants, with the result that the site of Adel-
laide was chosen as the capital of the new
province.
Luke Richardson has gone over the range
at Charleville (Q.). Sixty-seven years ago,
when fresh from Essex (Eng.), lie started
pioneering in Western Queensland. He was
the first white carrier on the Warrego, and
the first man to drive a team to Thargomin-
dali, Adavale and Milo.
“Harora”: I once saw the late William
J. Bryan on a platform with another orator
of almost equal note, Lord Rosebery. Only
Rosebery spoke, his address being a defence
of Freetrade ; William J., then on aworld-tour,
was an attentive listener. The scene was
the huge Surrey Theatre .in South London.
The pair made a curious contrast; Rosebery,
comfortably but not bulkily built, with a
clean-shaven, pink-and-white face and grey
hair, and Bryan, thick-set, bull-necked, pale
and dark-complexioned.
“Dalba”: Admiral Wiley, of the West
Virginia, has probably owed his life for the
past 36 years to W. B. Blacklock, a former
island agent, who has offices nowadays in
George-street, Sydney. During the memor-
able and disastrous hurricane in Samoa in
March, 1889, Wiley was a cadet in the
Vandalia, which settled on the reef in such
a position that her decks were swept by
seas, and nobody could keep foothold. The
crew took to the riggings, and during 12
hours of the fury of the storm dropped off
E. J. MACKRELL, Hon. Minister in the
Allan (Fie.) Government.
one by one into the waves. Just as it was
growing dark, W. Bi Blacklock drew the
attention of the natives to the last dropper-
off; a chain was formed by some 20 men
joining hands, and the human flotsam was
grabbed as it swept by. The youth, appa-
rently dead, was carried to the Consulate
and resuscitated —to become an admiral in
due season.
THE VISION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The years, like oxen in the yoke,
Draw home their heavy load of dreams.
Forgotten are the men that spoke,
The hours of calm, the storms that broke,
The hills and swamps and streams.
Deeds pass and cannot come again,
But dreams, the wealth of man, remain.
On some high peak we paused to see
The morning light a yellow land.
We heard the wind-song' in a tree;
And all the pathless woods were free
For strenuous will and hand.
Then came the dream, and far we saw
The magic lights of home and law.
The sweat upon the toiler’s brow,
The eager might of turning wheels,
The axe that bids the forest bow,
The flying loom, the striving plough
And ships with restless keels
bast for their moment and are gone;
Only the deathless dream stays on.
We, on the white man’s frontier set,
Have driven far our flocks afield;
In splendid toil our hands have met,
And in the vales of No-regret
Old wounds of time were healed.
But for that thing we truly know
Our feet have far and far to go.
Old well-contented nations died
Of plenty in their smiling lands,
Deeming an hour of flaunting pride
And triumph stayed and petrified
Honored their idle hands.
Full harvests turned to slow contempt
For braver dreams their fathers dreamt.
The dream we dreamt has set a flame
Of purpose on thought’s topmost heights;
The honor of an ancient name.
The deeds upon the scroll of fame,
These are but lesser lights
Of that large glory that can give
The hope by which we move and live.
The years, like oxen in the yoke,
Draw' home their heavy load of dreams.
When one white vision on us broke
A magic in our souls awoke;
And till the last light gleams
O’er mounds of long forgotten dud:
We hold a holy thing in trust.

‘Zanthus : Scientists have sometimes
speculated on the possibility of man recovering
(assuming that he ever had it) the power possessed
by lizards, crabs and other reptiles and crustaceans
of growing new limbs, or parts of limbs, to replace
ones that have been lost. A most interesting case
from the evolutionary point of view came under the
notice of Dr. H. Basedow near the mouth of the
Victoria River (N.T.). The Cinmu abos. of those
parts cut off with a stone knife two joints from
the forefinger of their gins as part of the initiation
ceremony. A horny growth resembling a diminutive
fingernail had formed on the mutilated stump of
one girl.
"Jimmy Possum”: With all my busli ex-
perience 1 was inug t n jugli to doubt my common -
sense and try whether a bee, as the blighter stated,
was unable to use his sting on one’s anatomy if
tlie breath was held. Going down to the hive, 1
carefully caught a buzzer by the wings, took a
mighty breath, and, hanging on to it till I got
red in the face, gently applied the willing harpooner
to the tender skin of my inner forearm. With
savage joy he drove in his dart full length. I made
a. frantic swipe at the digging demon, hitting the
hive in my excitement. Then the band commenced
to play. The honey-makers evidently thought L
had declared war, and launched a massed attack.
Wildly waving my arm, I held my breath and
streaked for safety, but not before 1 had collected
about two dozen red-hot stings. Now I’ve got a
bunged-up eye, a nose three sizes too large for
my face, a mouth all awry, and a wrist so badlj
swollen that I can scarcely button my shirt sleeve.
All 1 ask is for that blighter to c,ome along. I’ll
take him down to the bees and kick over the box.
He can hold his breath!

“G.H.W.”: Is Jim Grahame correct in
his observation (B. 2/7/’2S) concerning the attitude
of horses and cattle when they are grazing, or
standing exposed to the wind? Cattle usually
graze into the breeze, while the opposite holds true
for brumbies. This difference becomes apparent
when observing from an aeroplane. Airmen in
making a descent have no misgivings about surface
winds once they see which way Strawberry’s
tail points. Not so reliable in this respect are
sheep, but it is interesting to note that, indirectly,
they too assist the aeronaut to locate a hill or rising
ground. Sheep tracks wind round a hill, so when
the airman from a height sees a winding and more or
less circular line lie looks for some place other than
the area enclosed by this line on which to land.
And, before I leave the subject of horses, cattle
and sheep, it is interesting to note that from ,a
resting position horses rise on their front legs, while
sheep and cows rise on their hind legs.
“Wai-hoi”: Twenty miles cast of Darwin
(N.T.) there is a remarkable lake which the abos.
call “Ifoolpinyah,” and white folk “The Blue Lagoon.”
It is about a mile round, with precipitous sides
except on tire east, where a little creek gets away.
The water is so deep that soundings have not yet
been reached, and the darkies reckon “no more
catchem bottom.” Unlike most other northern
waters, it holds neither crocs, nor fish, and generally
is an eerie sort of place. Binglii won’t venture too
near it at any time, and when he does isn’t at all
comfortable. Two miles away are big, open swamps
where the local sports have a good time with the
ducks and geese when the season opens. Hereabouts,
too, the big lumbering buffaloes keep the wild
menagerie well stirred up.
* * * *
"The Rumpus”: Up in the Murchison
(W.A.) country, Jack Brown and myself came upon
the freshly-hacked carcase of a prime bullock,
about half a mile from a fairly full elaypan of water.
It was an easy matter to round up the few gorged
blacks ; and an impromptu court was then held over
the bones of the victim. The nigs denied doing the
deed, but their breath smelt of fresh meat, and
Brown singled out Billy, an abo. who had been
with him for years teamstering, to give evidence.
On hearing his former boss’s demand to speak the
truth, and nothing but the truth, Billy gulped a
couple of times, and then testified that he had
seen the bullock stand in the middle of the elaypan
and drink, drink, and again drink. A white man
on horseback then came along and said that the
bullock would empty the elaypan, leaving no water
for other bullocks, and ordered the blacks to spear
him. At once Brown and I searched for tracks, but
could find no horse or bullock either going
to or coming from the elaypan. Brown whipped out
his large clasp-knife, and with a few strokes
severed the bullock’s head from what remained or
its body. Holding the gruesome thing up with its
glazed eyes fixed on Billy, lie said in a terrible
voice “We’ll give you one more chance to tell
the truth. Suppose you don’t, these two eyes look
rrg'ht into your stomach, see the meat you eat, and
turn it all into live snakes!” The rest of the
slayers let out a frightened yell at this pronounce-
ment, and held their bellies, but Billy’s long
association with Brown and knowledge of his camp-fire
NO CIRCUS STUNTS FOR DAD.
“Mum, I want some ole clothes for that scarecrow,"
“Do yer! Well, loot, erbout them fancy togs Joe brought from Sydney ?”
“No! I want to scare the birds —not make ’em laugh.”
tales stood him in good stead. “No snakes come
belonga you, boss,” he said, grinning. “Me bin
just as good plurry liar.”
"FY7”: One of the brightest gems in the
book of bush lies is that which tells of a 'traveller
who came suddenly on a perturbed bullocky and
his teamless dray. Asked where his team was, he
pointed to an extra boggy patch in front of his
dray and said: “See them bubbles in th’ mud!
Well, that’s th’ blanky team.” The other day at
Kugowra (N.S.W.) a farmer named Bowes was
ploughing with five horses. Suddenly the whole
team almost disappeared from sight in the mud.
One went right under and was suffocated, while the
others were only got out after a stiff struggle.
* * * *
‘"Nambi”: “Billy Sec” (B. 25/G/'25) says
nobody has ever seen live snails between Southern
(Jross and the Trans.-line (W.A.). During the winter
of 1919 three of us were looking for cattle north
of Fraser’s Bange station. While we were camping
at Harper’s Dam it rained, and in the morning we
saw on the open flats numerous snails travelling
along. I am practically Kalgoorlie-reared, and
those were the only snails I had ever seen.
‘‘lvritz ’: The old diver referred to by
“Iroophorse” (B. 11/6/’25) is behind the times in
the matter of diving depths. Pearl-shell divers
out of Broome (W.A.), in the old-fashioned
hand-pump boats, work at a depth of 25 fathoms,
but only on rare occasions, as continuous work at
that depth makes it too hard on the crew keeping
the pump going. Their usual working depth is
18 fathoms. Engine-pump boat-divers also work
at a depth of 25 fathoms and occasionally at 35
fathoms. A few years back a Japanese engine-pump
boat-diver, working in the channel off the Broome
Jetty, brought up shell from a depth of 40 fathoms.
* * * •
“8.V.E.”: Another means of spreading
prickly-pear, the curse of Bananaland, is coming to
light and is second only to the emu. In 1912, in
the country lying between Surat and St. George
over a stretch of about 80 square miles, one came
on occasional wild pigs. They were runts and
scrubbers mostly and of no value. In 1917 a
prime Berkshire boar and a sow in litter, belonging
to a- butcher in Surat, went bush. At the present
time there are some thousands of pigs through this
district, the domestic animals having fraternised
with the bush variety. A sturdy and hardy race
of nomad pigs is the result. They feed on the
peai fruit, and the seed of that hardy vegetable
germinates after passing through the animal. This
means the more prolific growth of the spiffed horror.
As they make their home in the heart of the wilder-
nesses of pear, the pigs are going to be hard to shift.
"Tasmaniac”: Is the Victorian toadfisli
mentioned by “Jesmond” (B. 9/7/’25) identical
with the fish of the same name which frequents the
waters of the Speck ? The earliest reference to it
and its poisonous qualities is in Ross’s “Hobart
Town Almanack, 1836,” being a communication
from James Scott, R.N., Colonial Surgeon, as follows:
“The melancholy and dreadful effect produced by
eating it was lately instanced in the neighborhood
of Hobart Town, on the lady of a merchant and
her two children, who died in the course of three
hours. The poison is of a powerful sedative nature,
producing stupor, loss of speech, deglutition, vision
and the power of the voluntary muscles, and
ultimately an entire deprivation of nervous power
and death,”
* * * *
“Tarago”: Is this generally known? It’s
certainly new to me. A cow cocky in our district,
being short of grass, turned his herd on to a
young oat crop. Within a week or so he was
lamenting tlie loss of one of his best milkers.
Mlien the second one died he searched the crop
for a poisonous weed, but found it perfectly clean.
Then the third kicked the bucket, and lie sent for
a Government stock expert. After the post-mortem
the expert informed him that lu: had poisoned his
cows by giving them too much of the one class of
green feed.
* * * *
“ Jesmond”: The 25-feet well sunk single-
handed by a settlement soldier has not been beaten
thousands of times, “Gouger” (15. 9/7/’25) not-
withstanding-. The nominees of “A.E.T.” in the
same issue are nowhere. This big-hearted Digger
actually sank 25 feet single-handed. All the work
was done with one hand ; he lost the other arm in
the war.
* * * *
“Tarago”: The inexperienced person who
tries to hold a snake by the head (B. 2/7/’25)
deserves what is coining to him. I have several
times tried to hold one by the tail when it has
been disappearing in the ground or under a log.
On two occasions the reptile’s body parted in tlic
centre; on the other occasions it got a fai r purchase
with its fore-end and beat me. Heptile strength is
out of all proportion to animal strength. If you
must handle a snake, catch him gently by the tip
of the tail, and elevate him slowly. Once he’s up.
he can’t get back at your hand, but don’t omit to
hold him out at arm’s length, for he invariably
holds his head and a few inches of his neck
horizontally and seems to enjoy the novelty of
the position. But if j-ou make a practice of it, then
sooner or later you will strike the gentleman who
will throw himself back as soon as you stoop—
and you’ll be lucky it he misses you.
“Borom”: The coastal area of Eastern
Australia is the habitat of a flower known popularly
as the “rock-lily,” though actually one of the
finest varieties of the true orchid. It is seen at
its best generally about December and January, when
it produces beautifully tinted pale blue and yellow
blossoms, with long- white tendrils around them.
This flower is practically the only fine orchid which
is found in the southern coastal regions, but both
it and the more gorgeously-hued ones which flourish
in the North are easily the equals of the New
Guinea varieties so much sought after by collectors
and connoisseurs.
“Tamornie”: “Slam” (B. t)/7/’25) says
there is no record of the square and compass on
any hug, beetle or frog-. There is one insect how-
ever, which, under certain conditions, is almost as
useful as a mariner’s compass. This is the termite
which builds the mound known as the magnetic
anthill. Shaped like large flakes of shale set
edgewise in the ground, these mounds invariably
run within a few points of true north and south.
Surveyors have informed me that when in the
vicinity of the structures their instruments are
affected, and in localities where there is a greater
variation than usual from the true north and south,
the mounds show a similar variation in their
general direction.

THE: ROUGH RIVER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In an Abovig'inalities discussion on the “lung-fish”
( ceratodus ) mention is made of a Burnett River (Q. )
station manager who informed the English owner of
“night-prowling mobs of ceralodi which chased the
stock off the river-frontages and ate the grass.”
Jn a terror-haunted room
Where the great mosquitoes zoom,
On a station by the wild and wide Burnett,
hits a man with pallid face,
‘Sits and trembles for a space,
As he hears the river-rovers that beset
IHut and homestead close about with sore affright.
While the barramundi bellow through the night.
!Now his pen lie wildly grabs,
.As a sliriek the stillness stabs,
Giving news of yet. another slaughtered beast;
And the sweat that beads liis brow
Drips upon the paper now,
For lie hears the hordes come ravening to the feast.
But, “Dear sir,” he scribbles fast, though shakes tile
floor
VY itk the tattoo of the tadpoles on the door.
“Further losses I report,
Jll the stock that you have bought,
From the savage river creatures hereabout;
With the going of the sun,
It’s as much as may be done
To defend our very homes when they are out.
hong we fought with gun and poison-bait and trap,
But the hull-frogs chased the hulls right off the map.
'“River-frontages are flue,
When you come to water kine,
But the dangers you could hardly understand ;
By a quiet English burn
It's unlikely you can learn
Of the terrors of this strange and savage land,
When the mists upon the water settle slow
And the yabbies yank the poddies down below.
“But the fiercest of them all
Is the ceratodus tall,
As it steals at night from out the noxious ooze;
Men and beasts are headlong flung
By the blast of its great lung,
And your life and all you’re like enough to lose.”
Then he gasped and, turning many shades more pale,
Scrawled, “God helpus now —l hear the bunyip wail.’'

A Eetnarkable Achievement
* 4- *-
61 Terns
from ADELAIDE to DARWIN, on
DU
KjO
COMM TVKM
The history of motoring in Australia contains no finer achievement than that
just recorded by Messrs. Dunkerley and party, on a 2 ton “A.E.C.” commercial
truck shod with Dunlop pneumatics. With all equipment aboard the outfit scaled
62 tons on the weighbridge. This pioneer truck drive is fraught with great pos-
sibilities in the opening up and development of Central Australia. Transport is
the key problem in that country,'and there is little doubt that the problem will
be solved with up-to-date automobile trucks. Experts with a knowledge of the
difficulties of this 2GOO miles overland route, embracing huge sandhills, dry river
beds, and absence of made roads, were sceptical of such a heavy outfit getting
through. Others were of the opinion that no pneumatic tyres could stand up
to the stresses incidental to carrying 6§ tons across the Continent. Yet the
feat has been accomplished. It is the severest tyre test yet recorded in Australia,
and serves to further emphasise what a wonderful service giver the “Dunlop”
is; ' Motorists who require tyres to withstand hard driving, with freedom from
trouble, plus long and economical service, have only to fit “Dunlops” to ensure
satisfaction. They have no equal on Australian roads, furthermore they
cost you less. Be sure and ask for “ Dunlops. ” Garages can supply!

“Te Babarantiko” : How long the ugly
climbing-fish of the tropic mangrove flats can live
out of water I do not know. That it roosts for
hours on end on mangrove roots, or on bits of
flotsam stranded in pools which only spring tides
touch, I have seen quite often. Occasionally, the
little chap takes a small leap to change positions on
the same spot. If one approaches close, the fishes
leap into the pool. If away from the pool, thej'
skip along the moist sand on their bellies with
surprising rapidity until water is reached.
* * * *
“Tamornie”: Bone-pointing, as described
by “Up Top” (B. 2/7/’2o), is right as far as it
goes, but “U.T.” does not mention that for the spell
to be effective it is necessary that the victim be
WORSE’N DYNAMITE.
UNDERGROUND CAPP'N (who with good reason suspects serious
breach of rules) : “Did I ’ear blastin’ goin ’ on down ’ere a
bit ago?”
MINER : “Iss, Cap’n, plaaze. Et was that new ’and from Broken
’In; ’ez language ez somethin’ turrible.”
informed that he has been attended to, or “sung
dead,” as it is sometimes described. As for a strong-
willed nigger being able to resist the spell of
death, I have yet to hear of any refusing to die
cnee he has learned of the ceremony. I had a
tracker who turned up his toes after hearing that
the bone had been pointed. The ceremony had been
performed at least 150 miles away, and about two
months before my chap’s death, by an old man
from whose tribe the boy had stolen a gin, and
when the bone was pointed the whereabouts of the
intended victim were unknown. The news was brought
to the gin-stealer by a boy with some drovers who
passed my camp, and to whom the messenger
confided information which they handed on to me.
On hearing that he had been “sung.” the tracker
lay down in his camp, refused food, and in four daVs
was dead.
* * *• • *
“Up North”: The N.Q. niggers use the
message stick to definite purpose, but I doubt win ther
the stick itself ever carries a definite message. It
is crudely marked with various symbols, and when
asked a nigger will reel off a long message which
the marks on the stick apparently ccnvey. This
explains the many misunderstandings between white
and colored men, for the signs on the stick are
merely aids to memory. The nigger cannot realise that
the white man does not understand this shade of
difference, anl the latter takes the former seriously.
Each notch and mark represents a different message
or different essential in the message. For instance,
corroboree, badanga, initiation, pituri, dugong, white-
man. moon, etc., are represented each by a symbol
which serves as a mnemonic. When the far-travelled
nigger arrives at his destination and produces the
stick as his passport, he reads the symbols thus:
“The Warmitas cordially invite the Badangas to
the big corroboree, when the Badanga boys will be
initiated to warriorhood. The Warmitas have
plenty of pituri and will exchange for dugong oil.”
The messenger then “carries on” for another 100
miles or so, and, arriving at a lonely cattle-station,
again glances at his stick and reads. “A white
prospector is dying of fever near the Badangas’
camp. He wants quinine quickly.” And so on, till
the circle of messages indicated on the stick is
completed.
* * * »
“W.J.C.”: Adaptation to and variation
with environment is well marked in plants. The
pollen of the banana has become abortive, due to long-
years of cultivation. In using suckers solely for new
plants man has relieved the parent of the burden
of reproduction through the normal channel of seeds.
The banana, like a sensible vegetable, has recognised
the fact and ceased to waste energy-producing seeds.
Couch-grass gives another good example of response
to environment. An ordinary suburban lawn treated
with sea water would so assert its objection as to
commit suicide immediately. Yet on the low-lying
flats round Broad Sound (Central Q.), which are
daily inundated by the immense tide that runs in
those parts, couch-grass flourishes; and on them,
during the hours of ebb, cattle get their food and
salt-lick in one. The grass seems to have acquired
some of the characteristics of the normal Halophytes
or saline plants. The leaf surface is reduced, and a
stiffening to give a certain spininess has been
brought about. But so far the stunted habit and
fleshy leaf and stem have not entered into the
argument.
* * * *
“E.S.S.”: The case of the eight-year-old
boy, lost in the bush
at Manilla (N.S.W.),
where over 400 persons
turned out to scour the
country, emphasises the
folly of mob-searching.
In aimlessly wandering
about they repeatedly
crossed the boy’s
tracks, and thus im-
peded the work of the
trackers. I have been
tracking in company
with an abo. on two or
three occasions, and
know r what delays are
caused when numerous
other people cross the
trail or go along it for
some distance. The
time lost in picking up
the track again means
a lot to a youngster
who has been out for
a couple of days or
more. In several in-
stances, too, children
have hidden when they
saw these searchers.
Sometimes one of the
mob fortunately dis-
covers the little stray,
but many are never
found. In most of the
latter cases known to
me a mob turned out
promptly on the alarm
being given and before
a skilled tracker could
be obtained. Beyond
a radius of a mile from
the starting-point the
mob is a distinct dan-
ger. Two good native
trackers working alone
from that stage on are
worth more than 200
of the other kind.
“Cartot”: The affinity between the Aus-
tralian aboriginal and certain animals which are
not natives of Australia has been commented on by
numbers of observers, and there is scope for some
interesting anthropological speculation in this respect.
Dr. Basedow, in his recently-published work on
the aborigine, describes how he took some natives to
see a cageful of monkeys, none of the abos. in
the party having ever seen a monkey before. When
they arrived at the cage the occupants, who were
extremely bored with their w’hite visitors, instantly
manifested the greatest excitement, springing up
on the bars and gesticulating and pointing at the
aboriginals, who also became excited and crowded up
as close as they could to the cage. Another authority
on the Australian native relates how some monkeys
which had been born in captivity, and had never
previously seen any dark-skinned people, behaved
in a similar manner at the sight of two natives
from Australia.

Bay (S.A.) abos., and regarded the world whimsically
through his one eye; the other had been knocked out
in his youth during a tribal fight. He was well
known to all the hands on Wataka station 40 years
ago. One day Billy waited on the store clerk with
a request to write a letter for him to a brother
who was in Port Pi l ie, over a hundred miles s.-e.
At his dictation the clerk wrote a lengthy epistle.
After sealing the envelope he asked the abo. how the
letter was to be sent. “Send it, Boss!” echoed
Billy. “By cripes I take it my plurry self.”
* * * *
“Alwyn”: Re that fall of ice at 'the
Hawkesbury (B. 9/7/’25). Several weird phenomena
presented themselves to early Sydney folk. In
1793, just after dusk, an “appearance,” as the
Gazett'e called it, was seen in the shape of a ray
of forked lightning, which remained stationary for
five minutes —so ran the' report. Five years later
a hailstorm, with lumps of hail 6in. in circum-
ference, is said to have swept the infant settlement,
while in 1814 a similar disturbance broke every
window in the town within less than 10 minutes.
What probably constituted the most unusual phe-
nomenon in Australian meteorological history, however,
was a fall of sulphur at Warrnambool (Viet) on
September 16, 1878.
“Nuki” : Maoriland, in common with Aus-
tralia, is becoming agitated over the recurrence of
floods in various parts of the country. While
statistics show that the seasons recently have been
no wetter than those of sevei-al years ago, the fact
is apparent that devastating floods are now liable
to occur with much less encouragement than formerly.
Experts unanimously state that reckless deforestation
is the cause, and continuous and extensive tree-growing
the remedy. Meantime the Government, in addition
to steady compensation and assistance to flood
sufferers, is faced with the necessity of expensive
works in the way of stop-banking, clearing and
deepening channels. The next generation seems
likely to have reason to tinge its admiration for
the pioneers with regret that they were not a little
more enthusiastic in the matter of forest conservation.
* * * *
“Six and Eight”: A reference to lyre-birds
(B. 9/7/’25) recalls that the only place in the world
where Menurida are to be found is Eastern Aus -,
tralia. The family consists of three species only,;
and years ago these were comparatively plentiful.;
They w T ere often to be seen in gullies within a.
mile of Lithgow (N.S.W.), and once, from the,
guard’s van of a goods train, I saw a splendid cock;
close to where Newnes station now is. They are now
as rare in that neighborhood as hens’ teeth. Before;
the birds were absolutely protected they were shot;
by vandals for their splendid, tail feathers; nowadays
the fox is their worst enemy. Unfortunately that
smellful immigrant has an easy task, for the birds
are poor fliers, build their nests on or near the
ground, and breed very slowly. In 1911 Lucas and
Le Souef suggested the lyre-birds would flourish in
Tasmania and urged their introduction there, where
the fox was not likely to get a footing. Nothing
has been done, so there is still a chance for some
public-spirited nature-lover to carry the suggestion
into effect and thereby earn the gratitude of the
thousands who would rejoice to see these unique
and beautiful Australians saved from the fate of
the dodo and the moa.
“Up Top”: Niggers' legends are mostly
poor things, but occasionally there is a classic among
them. One such is the story of the giant Ka-kan, a
N.Q. abo. who brought fire to the earth. Ka-kan
and another were fighting beneath the Wonder Tree.
This tree men used to climb to their paradise. The
grass around the base of the tree was very dry,
and the struggling feet of the giant Ka-kan and
his enemy finally set it afire. Unfortunately, the
blazing grasses burnt the tree down, and the abos
on top had to stay there.
* * * *
“D. 8.”: Has any member of the Abo.
Caucus heard of worms falling from the upper
regions with rain? Recently, after half an inch had
been recorded, I saw several of the wrigglers, about
two inches long, emptied from a rain gauge. The
receptacle had been cleaned out several hours before,
and there was no possible chance of the worms
getting into it from the ground.
“H. J.L.” : Between the Queensland border
and the central telegraph line lies a strip of
desert and gibber country. The gibbers are the
home of the little blue rat called “poorakee” by
the abos. To whites they are known as “soldier”
and “drover” rats. This little undersized ’roo is
a meat eater, and the desert being alive with mice,
war between the two is continuous. About once in
30 years the rats have a clean round-up of the
desert mice and drive them south across the Diaman-
tina and Cooper rivers. Many of the mouse
plagues in lower S.A. are the outcome of such
raids. The poorakee chases his enemies across the
river and then returns home. Before these big

drives commence, the rats receive a signal that the
rivers are rising from the mud and tree frogs.
These are plentiful, and can sense a flood coming
though miles away. The rats, on hearing the
croaks, at once attack and drive their enemies
across the river ahead of the flood, which then
cuts off their retreat.
OUR WATTLE FAIRY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now that wintertide has vanished
With his west winds, dry and cold,
Dwells a fairy on the hilltops,
Garmented in shining gold.
Garmented in robes of glory,
Delicate, and rare and fine,
Shedding .splendor she reposes
Under dreaming gum and pine.
As she lights green aisle and alley
Thrushes sing and magpies call;
She’s our lustrous wattle fairy,
And her harms are known to all.
Where she lingers splendor burgeons,
Making ridge and valley fair;
Sweet the odors that she scatters
On the fresh, cool bushland air.
Round about her fallen blossoms
Lie upon the dewy grass ;
Shining pool and singing waters
Love her loveliness to glass.
Sweetest fairy of all fairies.
Sweet beyond all praise is she,
Born of sap and soil and sunshine,
Sought by butterfly and bee.
They who wander in green places
Ranging, roving far apart,
Leaving town and toil behind them,
Glimpsing her grow glad of heart.
j hey' who wander in green places
Seeing her, pure joyance find ;
Blessings on our wattle fairy,
Dancing in the velvet wind!

EVERY animal, every pound of wool, every sack of wheat and every ton of hay sold from off the
land takes with it a measure of soil fertility.
Unless this is replaced, the carrying capacity or productivity of a property is decreased.
The method of replacement is manuring, either with artificial manure, green manure or the manure
of stock.
The feeding of
Meggitt s Pure Linseed Sheep Nuts
or
Pure Linseed Oil Meal
to grazing stock on pasture is the most economical and surest way of enriching the land, hence
increasing carrying capacity. In addition to their high feeding value and conditioning qualities
each of these foods considerably enriches the manure of animals in the three main plant foods—
nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash.
The value of the nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash which reaches the soil through the medium
of the animal body by feeding one ton of Meggitt Ltd.’s Linseed Sheep Nuts or Linseed Oil Meal
exceeds £4. This figure is based on to-day’s fertilizer values in Australasia.
Compare these figures—
| FERTILIZING CONSTITUENTS IN 20001 b.
Thus, by feeding Meggitt’s Sheep
Nuts or Linseed Meal, one gets a
dual profit—namely, increased
wool, milk or carcase returns and
increased soil fertility, which
means INCREASED CARRYING
CAPACITY.

ihe G.-G. and Lady Forster gave the U.S.
Aavy something to tell them back home about
at Government House one night last week.
Outside, the desirable det. res., traced iii
electric light bulbs, looked like an enormous
wedding-cake, and on the lawn the fountain
spouted like an everlasting catherine-wheel.
Lhe crimson blooms of the poinsettia and
feathery Japanese bamboo against the blue
velvet upholstery of the largest and most
gorgeous private ballroom in the Southern
Hemisphere made a fitting back-cloth for the
glitter of _ glass-beaded frocks and gold-
braided uniforms. Let it be whispered that
little of the glitter came from genuine jewels;
there were tiaras, but they suggested hurried
recoveries from the pawnshop rather than
"family ' selections of long ago at the dia-
mond merchant’s. The choice viand's and
the tizz wandered amongst gold baskets of
wild heath and pink roses in the State dining-
room, and wattle suitably decorated the
buffet. The Forster lady swung an ermine
wrap upon delphinium-blue georgette em-
broidered in silver and fringed with silver tis-
sue; the diamond tiara, necklace and a string
of pearls were real. Silver and gold brocade
tempered the wind to the wife of Admiral
Coontz. The Administrator of New Guinea
and Mrs. Wisdom, she arrayed in Nile-green
georgette crystal-traced; Miss Garleton and
the daughter of the Speck Governor O’Grady,
who aired cherry-red velvet, were those en-
joying bed and board at Government House.
A train of chiefly white-clad debs, bent the
knee before vice-royalty, of the first triers
being Jeanette Barrett, daughter of the sur-
geon Barretts; Violet Tivey, lass of the
major-general; and Tulla Keating, in charm-
ing frocking of white crepe de Chiue bor-
dered with white and gold tissue roses—she
is the only daughter of ex-Senator and Mrs.
Keating. Mrs. S. M. Bruce’s choice covering
was of cosmos pink with beaten silver, and
Mayoress Brunton trailed floral bead em-
broidery upon wrapping of apricot-hued geor-
gette, chenille-brocaded in brown. Dress
honors nearly went to Mrs. Harold Grim-
wade, m raiment of gold lace, tissue and
fringe. Mrs. Bracegirdle suggested Tintex
in hydrangea blue, with handkerchief flounces
in pastel tones. Something different was
Gertrude Dix, who wore white Grecian
draperies with early harvest embroidery in
gold Miss Gillies, from ’Murca, banded
her beautiful white coiffure with pearls, her
gown of white satin being sashed with black.
.New-shingled Mrs. Carty Salmon pinned her
faith successfully on gold lace frocking.
Grey satin, steel-beaded, covered Lady Quick.
Festoons of beads of shades from gold to
brown was the apparel of Mrs. Knox; Beryl
Ainslie wore sheathing of pale gold brocade.
Between one-steps the admirals, captains and
officers of the U.S. Navy talked “ship” into
more or less interested ears. A notable
figure was a visiting bishop in dull purple
clerical attire.
St. Kilda w-as the only bit of Melbourne
that lit itself up in honor of the Fleet. The
Esplanade, picked out nightly in colored
lights, -was in consequence the haunt of
hordes of gobs, many of whom doubtless
went away believing that the seaside city
was the capital of Victoria.
. The faded interior of the Exhibition Build-
ing bloomed like a garden for the Gaud
Mayoral Fleet one-stepping. The loveliest of
hot-house plants collected from Melbourne’s
public gardens did not dim the glory of
wattle, palms and tree-ferns. Colored lights
beaconed the two miles of garlands, our wild
songbirds trilled silent notes in cameos
framed in artificial sunlight, and the emu
and kangaroo wandered in a bed of orange
poker-plants fronting a hedge where a roman-
tic little gate, all golden wattle, opened upon
coffee and food. Between dances the home-
gardener compared notes with his partner
upon the growing of poinsettias or the culti-
vation of primulas, until lie discovered that
beyond an arch of palms were oysters and
ale, or above the mountain gully of ferns
were bones to be picked and bottles of wine.
Admiral Coontz brought along his lady,
draped in black velvet with ermine wrap,
who received the usual floral offering.
Mayoress Brunton, whose black robing was
gold- and crystal-beaded, clutched a bouquet
of rare orchids. Mayors of the neigh-
boring suburbs came in the glory of
gold chains and robes, fringed with
miaow, and councillors wore court dress hung
with lace, rare or otherwise. Apricot geor-
gette and gold lace was Mrs. Bruce’s choice;
w'ine-hued chenille-embossed marocain was
worn by the Peacock lady; Mrs. W. M.
Robins distinguished black and gold brocade;
the Hennessy dame came in black satin and
lace; and there were silver bugle traceries
upon Mrs. 11. I. Cohen’s frocking. The wife
of the French Consul danced in dahlia-hued
gowning; cosmos pink georgette, artistically
beaded, pronounced Mrs. Fitcher’s raiment
Fans; and Mrs. Wilkins, of Frankston, was
an attractive figure in black with a cape
of dull gold tissue.
Some of the invitations accorded by Mel-
bourne people to the American sailors went
awry. One hostess who is notable for get-
ting iii early in such affairs sent her invita-
tions away months ago; and a large number
ot Yanks who liked the prospectus of the
feast waited at Port Melbourne pier on the
date appointed for the motor-cars that were
to convey them to the festivities. Becoming
impatient at last, somebody looked up the
lady’s ’phone number, and learnt that she
had died a week before the Fleet arrived.
Another party of officers, expecting enter-
tainment, arrived at a large house to find the
shutters up, and only one room inhabited.
After the invitation had been sent across to
meet the Fleet there had been a domestic up-
heaval which had caused the householder to
discharge the servants and close his house.
In the shock of events he had forgotten his
invitation; but he made amends by entertain-
ing _li is guests in. town. The idiots who
specialise in practical jokes found the occa-
sion too good to let slip. The occupant of
a humble hovel in South Melbourne was a
surprised man when a couple of gobs, after
inspecting . the weed-grown handkerchief
allotment in front of his decayed mansion,
askd him: “Say, 80, this sure ain’t the place
wliar. that gahden pality is, is it?” The
question enlightened him upon the reason
why so many sailors had been wandering
about looking in a puzzled fashion at his
shack—an elaborately prepared invitation
had been forwarded to the American Fleet
over his name and address.
Caterer Greville, who provided much food
lor Coontz’s fleet, was summoned to collect
the bill. It ran to over £5OOO, and, to
Greville’s amazement, was paid in gold.
The over-worked glad-rags of the civic
ball did duty once again for the Government’s
reception at the Exhibition Building on
Friday night. An army of 850 warblers,
drawn from 11 leading choirs, raised their
voices in those good old stand-bys of all
choral societies, “The Heavens Are Telling”
and “The Hallelujah Chorus.” Equally
thumb-marked were the selections offered by
the orchestra of 140, collected from five instru-
mental bodies, in “MeiStersihger,” “The Merry
Wives of Windsor” and “Finlandia”; but
although J. A. Delany, Alfred Hill, Marshall
Hall and Fritz Hart have lived and labored
there were no works of Australasian com-
posers to dispel the visitors’ illusion that
songbirds in these parts have no song. Some
unjust brain conceived the notion of pre-
senting each guest on arrival with a gas-
filled balloon; and thousands of adults rose
to the solemnly religious “Hallelujah
Chorus” clutching refractory rubber globules
that bobbed distractedly in the agitated air.
The . star turn was provided by the
Oklahoma band in many items. Premier
Allan, with Mrs. Allan, in black, pressed
the fingers of Admiral Coontz and his fellow-
officers. Mrs. Coontz, who had daughter
Bertha and niece Frances Green with her,
wore gowning of grey velvet. The Mayoral
lady was in black frocking with a cloak
of black-and-gold brocade; the Peacock dame
was also a front-rower, in champagne geor-
gette. with a dash of blue velvet. Bear-
Admiral Leigh’s wife glistened in white satin
and diamente. Donna Grossardi and Mrs.
Norman Anderson were of the trimly-rigged.
Clarice Beckett, the maiden with the un-
shingled coif-
fure here de-
picted by Hum-
phrey, has just
held her third
show of paint-
ings at the
Athenaeum
Hall. Several
of her works
are charming-
peeps of Beau-
maris, where
her folk reside.
The artist was
a National
Gallery stu-
dent for three
years, and
then passed on
for a few more
und e r Max
Meldrum’s
guidance.
An American admiral and some sea-lions
of lesser tonnage strayed into Bohemia (as
Melbourne does it) at a jollo staged at the
Vic. Artists’ Society H.Q. by the ex-students
of the National Art Gallery. A not-very-
near-relative of a Sydney artists’ ball, the
jazz was dimly visible through a screen of
cigarette smoke; and crayfish, onion-laden
salad, brown bread and beer contributed to
the Latin-quarter atmosphere. President
John Longstaff, secretary Mrs. Andrews, the
McCubbing, Will and Ed. Dyson and Mrs.
Dyson, Mrs. Russel Jackson, Bernard Hall,
Mrs. Tweddle, Esther Paterson, Pegg Clarke,
Mary Allan, Elizabeth Lahey (Brisbane),
Dora Wilson and Erica Smith were amongst
the wielders of the pen and mahl-stick pre-
sent. Weird and wonderful artistic efforts
decorated the walls, Pat Harford contribut-
ing a topical masterpiece of gobs being
greeted by an Australian miss.
Much crowd and uninspiring frocking were
chief features of the first day of the Aus-
tralian Steeplechase meeting at Caulfield on
Saturday afternoon. Admirals, officers and
their attendant women relatives made an
American corner behind the committee en-
closure and the vice-regal pen, where was
Governor Stradbroke, was the stamping-
ground of more. Mrs. Coontz was a wintry
landscape topped by a stone-lmed felt hat;
Mrs. Bruce added dull-gold embroidery to
black satin apparel with black millinery;
Mrs. Hall-Thompson, a study in nigger
brown, had a purple velvet hat wreathed
with nigger ostrich feathers; and kolin-
sky furs upon black gowning and a
toque of black velvet touched with silver were
Mrs. Barry Thomson’s turn-out. Mr. and
Mrs. A. D. Ilothman —he is representative
of the N.Y. Times with the U.S. Fleet, Mr.
and Mrs. Elmer Pauly, Mrs. Leonard and
Mrs. Hiskens were a few glimpsed amid the
crowd.
This is Lafayette’s sun image of Mel-
bourne’s
Mayoress, Mrs.
Bnmton. The
ball for the
TJ.S. visitors,
of which she
was hostess,
has set the city
talking. The
lady, together
with her hubby,
enjoys exceed-
ing popularity,
even the criti-
cal ladies of
the press pro-
nouncing her a
good sport. It
i s considered
likely that next
year will find
her still the
first lady of
the city.
The Golden Pacific Ball, organised by Ger-
trude Rennie for the Civil Ambulance at St.
Kilda Town Hall, was another spasm in
the orgy of Fleet worship. The G.-G. was
there, and Lady Forster added diamond and
pearl ornaments and distinction to the
gathering.. Admiral Coontz and Mrs. Coontz
—she inside a feathered-bordered frock of
sweet-pea hue—and other admirals and offi-
cers were made to feel at home with a statue
of Liberty on the stage, raising the torch
of freedom against a star-spangled blue back
curtain. Dancers tripped alternately to the
music of two bands, the better being that of
the fife and brass of the U.S. Melville—our
visitors certainly know all about the mys-
teries of rhythm. Miss O’Grady, from the
Speck’s Government House, stood with the
vice-regals, in gold lace and painting upon
apple-green frocking. Miss Coontz wore
sheathing of flame-hued velvet, and cousin
Frances Green—a pretty and smart dresser
—one-stepped in blue georgette touched up
with silver lace. Mrs. Chauvel wrapped
herself sweetly in. pink georgette with bor-
dering of puffed pink satin. Viola Ramsay
made one of the prettiest shows in white,
gleaming with crystal and feather-trimmed.
Secretary Gertrude Rennie was in pink and
gold lace.
The legion that knows \\\ L. Baillieu was
genuinely sorry for him when it learned that
his wife had passed out at their Toorak home
last week at the height of the Fleet festivi-
ties. In the days -when he had to struggle
for a place in the sun she was his chief
stand-by, cheering, and encouraging him be-
cause of her faith in W.L.; and when success
came his way in such abundance he prized
it doubly because he could strew roses in
her path. From her dad, Edward Latham,
she inherited that philanthropic spirit which
marked her benefactions for many years. She
left four sons and four daughters. Three of
the eight (Mrs. Robert Ramsay, O.L. and
J.L.) got the news by cable in Europe.
Spring looked in, at the behest of the
A.N.A., for a few hours at the Exhibition
Building, when young Sammy met Miss
Melbourne at a jazz amid the palms, ferns,
wattle and flower-beds that had done service
for the Mayoral frivol of the night before.
No grandmothers or mothers were invited to
compete with their daughters and girl friends
for Yankee smiles or favors, as at mere offi-
cial balls. Nine hundred bonnie girls, in
their best evening frocks, danced with the
gobs. Masculine jaws moved to tbe chew
ing of gum, and noblesse oblige caused many
fair partners to masticate a bit of proffered
spearmint. It was a lovely party, and the
matrons of the committee and the A.N.A.
deserved the applause they got.
Making a virtue of necessity the Yorick
Club (Melb.) abstained from tipple the other
night when it foregathered to see LongstaffV
portrait of David Watterson unveiled. It
drank toasts in coffee and tried to look as if
it liked the innovation. The explanation
was that an attempt to obtain a permit under
the Licensing Act had failed because the
club hasn’t a regular dining-room. As Justice
Cussen, one of the oldest members, had been
asked to do the unveiling, and as Stan
Argyle, Chief Sec. (official administrator and
defender of six o’clock closing), and Eggle-
ston (Attorney-General) attended as club
members, appearances had to be maintained.
One legal luminary whispered that it would
be possible, after such a rehearsal, to “go on
the waggon for a fortnight with Uncle Sam’s
sailormen—if necessary.”
Marie Burke began her second year in
Australia very promisingly in the first per-
formance in Melbourne of. “Wildflower,” on
Saturday night at the Itoyal. The show went
well to a big house, and the charmingly artis-
tic costumes and curtain-falls found instant
favor. Marie herself, in her pretty national
dress of gay cretonne with white chemisette
and Italian head-dress, took the audience with
her on an aeroplane flight of gaiety and
tuneful notes. Her white satin evening-gown,
gleaming with front panel of crystal feather-
edged, is likely to have copyists, though it
needs her vivacious face and shiny-smooth
black coiffure to go with it. The agreeable
Marie la Varre wears a dashing black-and-
white confection and trim tailored riding
suit; but everyone will like her best Avhen.
with powdered hair, she is robed in Eliza-
bethan gowning of rose taffeta sprinkled
with bvinches of stiver grapes, her cloak being
a wonderful conception of wine-hued velvet
with petals of gold! tissue.
The J. 11. Ivealting couple—he was an
Apple Island Senator for many years—
helped to make I|ncle Sam’s gold-braided
ones home with ! a dance at their pretty
South Yarra home. Ivory moire velours was
the lady’s uniform for the occasion, and
daughter Tulla, who w&s a deb. at the G.-G.ls
ball, was in dainty frrteking of lace.
A very capable lady is Mrs. W. A. Osborne,
M.Sc., M. 8., 8.5., who left by the Osterlek
for the Cold Land last week. Her Avar work
in munition factories brought her aii
invitation from the British committee to the
International Congress on industrial acci-
dents and diseases to jojjn the British dele-
gation to the fourth coinference, fixed for
September. The lady of degrees is the wife
of the Professor of Physiology at Melbourne
University. In her leisure hours she looks
after a young family, investigates conditions
in the printing trade and does surgical clinics
at the Melbourne Hospital.
Mrs. Jimmy Dyer missed the UJ?. Fleet
functions; she packed her pretties .and sailed
with Mrs. Mansley Greer for a monfth’s holi-
day in Norfolk Island. Prior* to laming she
had a gathering of friends at Kinnoull,
where elocutionist Beatrice Gfernan, arrayed
in Chinese costume, recited .Selections from
the poems of the early waiters' of 'the Orient.

An afternoon tented in blue and misty
greys domed the garden party at Govern-
ment House. The at fresco was in honor
of the visiting Americans, and as it was the
only vice-regal function of any size the
invitation-list had . burst its bonds and
splurged into the thousands. However, there
was plenty of fresh air, if not too much
room for the display of sartorial effects.
Tennis was served on the green court and
ices at the top and bottom of the garden.
Seaplanes racketed overhead, the band
played “The Star-spangled Banner” and
“Dixie,” and in Port Jackson rode the grey
warships, like leviathans smudged into the
greying horizon. Let loose among the newly-
blossoming stocks and the goldfish in the
fountain were five big fish of the navy,
gilded all —Admirals Robison, Wiley, Bost-
wick and Rodman, and our own Viking
in full kit. But Sir Dudley didn’t have a
monopoly of the family trimmings. Lady de
Chair wore impressive powder-blue velvets,
and her millinery of the same tone showed a
distinct bias to brim. Daughter Elaine was
engulfed in woad-like blues, which same
shade was favored by Jean Wardle. George
Fuller’s lady got a handsome but austere
effect from black and violet; and American
Consul Lawton’s wife suggested the first
greenness of Spring in her frocking. Arcli-
gaiters Wright trod the sward with Mrs.
Wright, and the Papal delegate flung an
amethystine cloak around him with a Rubens
effect. Sam Hordern’s lady was there, in
a frock lush with fringe, and Mrs. Tony
Hordern mingled black Ottoman and sable
with the landscape. Airs. Geoffrey Hughes
Was an attractive adjunct to an afternoon
that was further embellished by the presence
of Town Clerk Layton.
Only the Palais could house the dance of
the R.A.N. to their American brothers in
blue. Hundreds of guests were there, and
though the Admiral and his party did not
come on till late after the dinner on the
flagship the dancers got an early start. And
for once the Palais Avas kind, and tempered
its wind to the shorn lamb, and frocks got
a chance to flash their splendor on the
eye. Lady de Chair was a blaze of opals
and pearls where she was not swathed in
crystallised Persian blues; and Admiral Robi-
son’s lady wore a Chinese coat as saffron as
a sunrise Back o’ Bourke. Tangled up with
the jazz were “The Star-spangled Banner”
and-“ God Save” —what sort of a time will
a band have when a national anthem in
Esperanto is set to music? Captain Robins’s
wife and Commodore Wardle’s Jean had the
spotlight on them for a dizzying moment
when the captain of the port and his lady
advanced to greet the vice-regals, and then
from three paces in the fear the Commodore
and his daughter stepped forward with accu-
racy and precision. Surgeon MacCormick’s
lady was very handsome in black georgettes
that carried a bit of Australian heraldry
m the form of a silver-blazoned rising sun;
while Mrs. Thornett’s ermine cloak was so
wonderful that it looked like a stage effect.
There was the scarlet of military and the
blue of the navy threaded through the night,
which scintillated with decorations.
. L ast Thursday the West Virginia, refus-
'ag to be out of it, smiled a greeting as
gleaming as the brasses in her trim launches
to the hundreds bidden to her party. An
afternoon with the breath of Spring on its
breeze and a bandeau of bunting around her
decks gave the big warship as much an air
of frivolity as Alavs might wear with a rose
above his ear. Grim and graceful the battle-
ship remained in spite of the foolish trim-
mings that the presence of civilians always
calls for. The Admiral and his captains were
the afternoon’s hosts and all Sydney’s Who’s
Who and Who’s Not browsed about the
gleaming decks. There was jazz fore and
aft under the platform where the seaplanes
perched with folded wings, as well as before
the carpet where a perfectly dazzling array
of admirals toed the line, supported by Airs.
Robison in sable georgettes with ermine high
lights, and Colonel Williams’s lady, a study in
cigar browns. The picturesque Captain Coote
attended our Viking's lady and Elaine, and
the party gained a further dash of charm
troni the presence of Commander Grant’s
lady. Airs. Tony Hordern and Airs. Ken
Richards sported twin black silk coats.
Mayoress Cecilia Walsh smiled civic ap-
proval, Mrs. Vincent McAuley flew one of
the smartest hats aboard, and among the
afternoon’s good lookers were Moira Brady,
Morna McCormick and Mrs. Leslie Walford.
Another “free to all” was the dance on the
flagship California. About 1500 invitations
had gone out, and dancing Sydney with a
whoop jazzed up the battleship’s side from
shortly after 8 o’clock. It was about the
only chance of jazzing many got, for by
9 o’clock the big decks could hardly hold an-
other pair of even Sydney girl-size shoes. As
for the coat-hangers in the cloakroom below,
another scarf would have been the last straw
and probably sunk the ship. By the time
the last woman had received her coat it was
probably cockcrow, though “Lights out” had
been scheduled for midnight. Of the vice-
regals, who came fairly early, Sir Dudley,
flashing every possible inch of gold braid that
emblazons an admiral’s outfit, was as pic-
torial as Lady de Chair. Her black velvets
were plain (one might almost say frugal)
except for her magnificent pearls and dia-
monds. Admiral Robison’s Jady, on the
other hand, swished in beautiful ivory bro-
cades and lace. Many of the dancers had
been bidden to the flagship to dine with the
Admiral before the general revels began;
of these were the Surgeon Dan Kellys and
the Ernest Jenks couple. Admiral Mac-
dougall, of the New Mexico, also staged a
dinner-party of note, among the guests being
Mrs. Vivei’S, in white georgettes sparkling
like hoar-frost with diamente, and Jean
Wardle and Morna MacCormiek. Naval-
Captain Robins’s lady wore lavender and
silver, which same coloring was adopted by
Mrs. Dunn, whose Minister for Agriculture
was with her. The Brigadier-General Ander-
sons, Lloyds and Herrings and some younger
Cox-Taylors gave a military flavor to the
gathering. Mrs. Mortimer Richards was
outstanding among those phalanxes, and Mrs.
Thornett put up a sartorial imitation of
“The Sea Hath Its Pearls ” in georgettes
like a stretch of cool sands and a magnificent
lasso of the oyster gems. Ministei-s of the
Crown, Rotarians, the Clifford Hay couple
and Miss Preston-Stanley, M.L.A., were
mixed up in the kaleidoscopic groups that
moved about the awninged deck. The wassail
of the night was a punch that had had all
the kick taken out of it. Neither was its
bouqxxet that of the fruit of the vine: it
tasted only of pineapple. Still, one could
get drunk on its color, which was of an
intoxicating absinthine hue.
“The officers are all right, but their
parties! Well, the young ladies go thei*e
and sit about a bit of curtained-in deck, mak-
ing polite conversation, and if a goil hasn’t
plenty of pep in her she has no sort of a
time in the woild. But when we give a
dance we’d be ashamed to let any young
lady sit around and not show her a good
time. You come to our dance on the Cali-
foinia!” The canteen-worker on whom the
invitation was pressed did go to the dance
on Saturday night; and says it was the
best party of all the Fleet festivities. She
adds that it will take a gallon of arnica
and a similar quantity of witch hazel
to bleach her black-and-blue shins back to
their natural snowy whiteness—she didn’t
miss a dance, or anybody else’s heel, the
night through.
Though it lost something in atmosphere
through not being held in the Barracks
square, the military tattoo at the Show
ground was the most spectacular success of
the Fleet visit. There was a touch of the
fantastic in the scene from the stands. Over
the showi-ing the curtain of the warm, still
night was stabbed and pierced by countless
electrics; and on the gi’eeny swai-d, flooded
by their whiteness, bands were massed, 1.5
strong, heralded as they swung from the
outer rim of shadow by gunfire and a fan-
fare of tnxmpets, and separated by the color-
ful fire of bursting rockets. Boots, boots,
boots, marching up and down again to the
tunes Of “Life on the Ocean Wave,” “Gii-ls
of Amei’ica” and that too-famous “Madem-
oiselle from Armen tieres.” Then slow
step and quick step they trod to appropriate
music, while the crowded stands roared their
applause. And while all the world, includ-
ing the vice-regals and the visiting admirals,
wondered a group of mounted police danced
their steeds through the figures of the lancers
and the maypole, finally side-stepping with
the daintiness of professional humans. A
great exhibition of horsemanship, it might
have inspired a Grieg composition. Orndur-
xnan and Rorke’s Drift were re-enacted by
the light of green and red flares, and to the
accompaniment of thundering cannon and
exploding of mines that must have used up
enough gunpowder to burst a subway under
the Harbor. One slightly stunned man and
a poor excited gee were the only casualties.
General Brand and Brigadier-General Lloyd
stage-managed the impressive ceremonial.
A warm, soft night added to the success
of the dance at the Palais on Monday. The
jazz was to help out the treasury of the
Hospice for the Dying in Daidinghurst, and
the committee had every reason to be de-
lighted at the roll-up. Mayoress Cecilia
Walsh shed the lustre of rose du Barri velvets
over the night, and Mrs. William Macleod’s
tall slimness emerged from a frock so finely
woven of chalk heads that it gave the effect
of panne velvet. Pretty Mrs. Slattery, Mrs.
Leahy and Josephine Marks were others on
the energetic committee.
Though the Mayoral ball to the Fleet’s
brass-hats and Sydney’s social tonnage missed
fire, the dance given to the ratings by Gaud
Mayor Stokes and sweet Cecilia Walsh, his
niece and acting-Mayoress, clicked from the
jump. Upstairs and downstairs and in his
Ludship’s chamber the men of the lI.S.
Navy footed it with their partners —every-
where but in the basement. The partners
were mostly pretty girls from the big shops.
Though some of them in the rush for ferries
had to do their final prinking in the ladies’
cabin, when they arrived at the Town Hall
they were as neat and complete as anyone
could wish. New side-shuttles and half-
revolutions and sudden swoopings that ended
in a rapid tee-to-tum found the girls a bit
breathless, but game.
Not many Americans took part in the mili-
tary mounted paper-chase, but Major Power,
a marine, and Lieut. Cqatswortli rode boldly
after the fleeting forms of the hares—
Quartermaster Jay, Sergeant Glover and
Corporal Whitney—and with flying coat-
tails a Murkan padre kept well up to the
front. Far ahead Brig.-General Lloyd took
the hurdles with a swallow skim. The long
water-jump gave a few of tlie “hounds” a
ducking, and Mrs. Dick Martin (she used
to he Miss Dorothy Fox, of Bathurst) had a
bath in the canal. “Help me up,” she said
gaily, and she was off again. Slender Miss
Kenyon, boyish in her speckled riding-
breeches and flapping cutaway coat, won the
whip presented to the best lady rider. Com-
modore Wardle handed over the trophy.
Golden wattle and sweet-pea blossoms
decked the officers’ mess in the long stone
terrace in Victoria Barracks on Saturday
night. A hop in honor of some of Cousin
Jonathan’s dancing-men was the excuse, and
Old Glorv draped over the jazzers’ heads.
Mrs. Brand, in a moonlight glitter of
sequined black marocain, welcomed the
guests, her General being at the moment in
the throes of the commercial travellers’ ban-
quet to U.S.A. Commander Willis,
Lootenant Moore, Captain Hawthorne, of the
Colorado, and Lootenant Gill —who guessed
he had two IPs to his name, _ because his
father was a Welshman —were in the party.
So that none might be bushed in the city
owing to the dearth of cars on so crowded a
night, Major Berryman had a little herd of
motors to meet the U.S.A. cousins at Fort
Macquarie.
Rear-Admiral MacDougall led a band of
his merry men to the Ambassadors on Mon-
day, when the Millions Club did their little
bit towards making the - visitors happy.
Anchors and flags greeted the eye at every
turn, and the club’s president, Arthur Rick-
ard, radiated geniality. Commodore Wardle
represented the Australian Navy, with daugh-
ter Jean. Cecilia Walsh, the Consular Law-
tons and George Fuller and his lady were
others who tasted the joys of the evening.

trude Jordan, who gives her name to one of

Kathleen O’Connor takes herself and her
gift for composition to England by the
Ulysses. Kathleen has already had several
songs published. One, “The Jester,” ap-
peared last year in America; another, “Lul-
laby,” was issued by the Composers’
Music Corporation; and her latest, “Even-
ing,” the words of which are by A. Gore-
Joncs, of Queensland, has been published by
Chappel, and will soon be on the London
market. Kathleen has the true gift of song-
writing , and such artists as Alfred O’Shea
have sung her works at their recitals.
The Feminists gave a party, all tangled up
with gold braid eaglettes and epaulettes, at
their clubrooms; and on Saturday night
most of the warboats housed dinner parties
and dances, the largest of these being on the
Tennessee. The Institute of Journalists’
lunch to the visiting pressmen and gala per-
formances of “Jessie James” and “The Street
Singer” were other noteworthy Fleet events.

other great institution helped by Mr. Hal-
loran’s brilliant legal mind is the Deaf,
Dumb and Blind Institute.
All the world did not climb aboard the
California the other night. Kreisler ran a
rival party at the Town Hall, and as it was
his farewell to Sydney the music locusts,
among them lots of American bluejackets and
officers, swarmed in their thousands over
the landscape. The Mendelssohn Concerto,
played in conjunction with the State Orches-
tra, was the big work of the evening, and the
second part of the programme was a chaplet
of smaller gems. One of these, a Melody in
A Major, came from the pen of General
Charles Dawes, Vice-President of the United
States. Sydney liked it so much that
Kreisler played it a second time. In the end
the violinist made a simple and sincere
speech which, characteristically, he managed
to turn into a pretty compliment to his wife.
A budget from Brisbane: —
S’Matthew got the glad hand of the Shakspearean
Society at the Women’s Club the other evening, when
Hell Douglas-Graham was responsible for the musical
and dramatic provender. A copy of the Bard’s
works was passed over to his Ex. to entertain him
on his voyage to his homeland. Allan Wilkie, he
confessed, had helped greatly to increase his know-
ledge of the dramatist who deals so much in quota-
tions.
Six hundred masked dancers went to the
South Brisbane City Hall for the affair
in aid of the funds of Yeronga tennis players.
The old-fashioned pumpkin with a candle-end
inside, devils, bats, owls and dark lanteins, not
to mention skeletons that walked the floor, did
their best to create an atmosphere of awe. Tango
and black was the color scheme, and a spotlight
picked out red pierrots, pierrettes, Dutch maidens,
butterflies and sheins. Dudley Sumerson and Fred
Derrick, as Mephisto, supervised the jazz, lan Mcßain
dolled up the hall, and Hamilton and Pass supplied
the last word in lighting. The All-Star jazz band
and the Costin Hawaiian Serenaders provided the
noise, and the Costin maiden danced a graceful hula.
Amongst the Jazzers were Tessa Reading, Kathleen
Forrest, George Shaw, Harold Anderson, Cecile
Pritchard and Rob Primrose.
When the curtain went up at Gympie for the
first night of Allan Wilkie, the wardrobe had failed
to arrive, so the company entertained the house with
an impromptu concert. Milton Sands and Ellis
Irving have serviceable voices, and when at nine
the missing glad rags turned up, the town was in
a'state of high enthusiasm and ready to sit on until
the small hours. Midnight, in fact, didn’t see the
finish of the show.
Tire kiddies’ ball fixed up by the Wattle League
in the Troc. on Saturday afternoon was a pleasing
spectacle, rounded off by a grand march of tiny
tots as powder puffs, Spanish dancers, cats and other
animals and objects. Beryl Cobb, as a swan, died
gracefully. Grace Deshon, looking amazingly well
since her trip to the Cold Country, was with Sir
Matthew and Captain Saunders. She is at present
eating the vice-regal salt.
Elsa Stralia received the city’s handshake at the
Town Hall. Mrs. Mott, who had known Elsa in
London, spoke a few words of appreciation between
the tea and cake. The Mayoress hostessed the party,
and amongst those who gathered were the Bruehe
and E. R. Mutton ladies, Mrs. Tom Ryan, Mrs.
Premier Gillies, Mrs. William Lennon, Mrs. Ted
Theodore. Mrs. J. Shaw, M. Forrest, J. Bain and the
E. R. B. Jordans. The singer had a big welcome
when she stepped off the train, and so much blossomry
was heaped upon her that Lennon’s hadn’t vases
enough to hold the tributes,
Mrs, M. Forrest spread luncheon for Miss Llewellyn
Lucas of Melbourne, at the Wintergarden Cafe.
Miss K. Forrest, M. L. Reading and C. V. Hives
Were amongst the guests.
The decorations at the (oncoming Town and
Country ball in August have been bespoke by Charlie
Chain'd for use in some of- the high-society scenes

Lots of Melbourne housewives whose hus-
bands back racehorses were absent on Monday when
the rent-collector called. The explanation was that
Mediterranean (Sea Prince—Stephanos), who had
finished ten lengths behind the winner of a Trial
Hurdle three days before, had won the Australian
Hurdle at Caulfield from end to end, and that Comedy
Star, unplaced in a country event at his previous
start, had defeated some of the best horses in train-
ing in the Malakoff Stakes. Mediterranean, whoso
nominal quote was 33’s, was never off the bit. He
jumped the last hurdle well clear of Rauquart,
Bendoc, Rahda, Roisel and Berrinbo, and was three
lengths in front at the end. Berrinbo (B’s), Roisel
(s’s) and Rauquart followed the outsider home.
INCONSISTENT RUNNING.
BENNO: “These Yanks beat me, Bill! In
America they've cut out the booze, yet
’ere they are with s.-p. bookies in their
Navy!”
Mediterranean is trained by R. Cameron for S. H.
O, Blackwell and C. Cook, and was ridden by Warner.
After opening at 7 to 4 for the Malakoff Stakes,
nine furlongs, Valiant drifted to 5 to 2, and Sailing
Home came with a rush to 9 to 4 from 7 to 2.
Comedy Star was at 20’s. This stylish but hitherto
disappointing Comedy King—Rattle horse finished
best, and had his head in front of Royal Charter (25’s)
at the judge’s box; Valiant and Noscitur—an early
winner, properly placed—being less than a length
away. Irish Rufus (20’s) might have been closer to
Minterne (5 to 4 on) in the Steeplechasers’ Flat
had Webster relied on his always resolute finishing
run; as it was, the old battler was in front most
of the way, and faded when Minterne passed him.
Silver Heart (7’s) was only a shave behind the
Sydneysider, on whom Pearce rode an almost too-
confident race. Jupiter (6 to 2) showed what a
capital chance he has of collecting the Australian
Steeple next Saturday by clearing away from Palbi
(4’s) in the Moondah Steeple. Minterne (12st.
21b.) is likely to be favorite for the long-distance
event, but lack of a race over the jumps won’t im-
prove his prospects. Silver Heart (list. 71b.), who
has every qualification including a success in the
Aus. Hurdle, is here selected to win, with Jupiter
(lOst. 91b.) next best.
“Chiron”; It has become a fashion in Melbourne
during the jumping season for a horse to run at
least one slow race at Moonee Valley before going
on to bigger things. Pildin prefaced his G. N.
Hurdle success by running an indifferent second at
the Valley to Sir Charles. On the same day Irish
Rufus was badly beaten in the Steeplechase—the
field was composed of goats which haven’t been
placed since—only to come out at Flemington' and
dispose of much classier* animals in the Kensington
Steeple. Mediterranean is the latest example. He
stops badly at the end of two miles in the Trial
Hurdle at the Valley, and Penlocin licks him by
10 lengths. Three days later the Valley squib out-
stays some of our best horses over the battens in
the Australian Hurdle at Caulfield, 3} miles and
20 yards. And not even a “Please explain.”
* * * *
“Cascade” : On the Flemington track one
morning last week. Moon, the steeplechase jockey, was
giving Sirocco the air when the bit broke and
Sirocco bolted. Moon clung desperately to the
mane over the first exhilarating mile or so, but
during the next round he became dazed and only
his mechanical grip on the small tufts of hair pre-
vented a nasty fall. Presently he returned to
earth. A trainer astride a hack was thumping
him on the back. “Feelin’ all right, now you’ve
shown us what an impostor Tom Mix is?” the
thumper asked.
* * * *
Very few horses are doing better work at
Randwick than Bard of Avon (Urney—Belle of
Avon), but with the colors up he has been rather
in and out. At Rosehill (N.S.W.) on Saturday,
however, the chestnut, backed from 4’s to 2’s for
the California Handicap, 10 furlongp, galloped
kindly for young Hillier and smothered Moisha and
Hermealdo in the run home. He could apparently
have knocked a second or so off the time, 2min.
61sec., though it was fast for Rosehill; and he
must be regarded as a Metropolitan possibility with
7st. 41b.—lie has 7st. 51b. in the Epsom as well.
Kingsley, owner of Dreblah (Halberd—Vernonia),
landed a big stake on the recruit from Ascot and
Victoria Park in the Mississippi Stakes, eight furlongs,
supporting him from 20’s to 6’s. Last season the
old fellow went sour and refused to do his best,
but on this occasion he rushed past brisk young
horses like Fortafest and Whizbro and had them and
everything else settled six furlongs from home.
A spell has evidently restored the old ’un’s en-
thusiasm for the game.

Port Adelaide and Tattersall’s both con-
tinue to set a fast pace for S.A.’s two older racing
clubs. The Morphettville course was borrowed for
the new Tatt.’s Cup of £2OOO. Valwyne headed the
handicap, with Warwickshire, Stvalia and Wvcherley
next; but nothing over eight stone had a chance with
the speedy local division, Steel Bronze (Prince
Traquair-—Lady Pistol) winning from Amberoid,
with the handsome dividends of £l9 15s and
(for second) £l3 14s. The steeplechase on
the same day was a poor joke. Of 11 starters three
fell early and two were left well behind. The
other six were all together at, the last fence, and a
mistake by the leader brought down tile lot ; on
which the tailed-off pair hurried for home and
collected stakes and dividends.
* * * *
“Timo”: A. B. Postle, whose 7 l-ssec.
for 1 5 yards stood alone in the record-book for
many a day, reckons that 45 isn't too old for
running, and last season at Brisbane showed that
he can still beat most of the young fellows,
though a doubtful knee sometimes goes back on him.
in his spare time he shows younger runners how
to get out of the holes. “Bundy” Parker, the
Ban, n .land amateur sprinter, is regarded by the
, ex-champion pro. as the best natural runner in this
’’ or any other land. “Where else,” asks Postle,
“will you find a lad of 19 who, after two weeks’
training, will, run you three inside for 100 yards?
That’s what Parker can do.”

Emotional fellows, these Filipinos, under
their outward mask of stoical indifference! When
referee Joe Waliis intervened at the opening of
the 19th round of the De Leon-Congress fight at
the Sydney Stadium, Gavino clasped his defeated foe
in his brown arms and kissed his cheek with fervor.
Dick had given him the father of a hiding for the
first eight rounds, and had hurt him in otner rounds
that were either even or went to the brown bov
by a narrow margin; so perhaps the embrace was
De Leon’s mode of expressing his surprised gratifica-
tion at an unexpected victory. From the moment
that a head-bump split his left eyebrow, dose to
the nose, in the third round, and he sensed his
own blood, Gavino fought like a beaten but
desperate man, and it spoke volumes for his courage
that he contrived not only to stay but to outpunch
his man. In the ninth round the tide began to
turn; chiefly because the Melburnian got too weary
to box and could only swap occasional punches, and
the Filipino’s were the heavier. In a keenly
exciting thirteenth, by the end of which neither
could punch a hole in a paper drum, Congress
collected a cut right eye, and in the seventeenth
he was dropped in the Filipino's corner. Just before
the bell to end the eighteenth, a right swing to the
point put the Melbourne boy down on his face and
apparently out; but the bell rang at “one,” and he
was carried to his corner, where he revived enough
to assure Wallis that he was fit to continue. But
he wasn’t. The first punch showed that he was
helpless to defend himself, and the referee put an
end to his troubles. De Leon, Bst. 131 b.; Congress,
Bst. lOjlb.

The Sammies made a good showing at
the Melbourne Stadium on Saturday night and must
have been satisfied with the sportsmanship of the
crowd. The house yelled delightedly when Quirk
declared the fight between Sailor Kenhy and Bob
Wilson, each 9st. 101 b., a draw. In the next, cool,
hard-hitting Jack Carroll rattled Sailor Ritchies both
lOst. 31b., with long-range punches, and earned the
verdict that went his way, But Ritchie fought
gamely, Danny Evans’s battery of stinging lefts
and rights beat Sailor Frederieo Ilisan, a Filipino
whose speed was not sufficient to save him, with a
technical knockout in the fourth round; and Bert
McCarthy (9st. 81b.), though handicapped by a
poisoned hand, dodged the fearsome wallops of
Sailor “Battling” Skee (lOst. lib.), and inflicted a
perfect knockout on the point in the third round.
Skee was “out” for two minutes. Salvino Jamito’s
plunging tactios nonplussed Sailor Jesse Butler
for a while, but Salvino took a bigger dose of clean
punching than had been dealt him for a long time
when Butler got to know his ways, and Butler’s
points victory was acclaimed with shouts that nearly
lifted the roof. Billy McAlister (Bst. 51b.), after
saving himself in the first round by taking a count
of nine, came back and knocked skin and hair off
the Filipino sailorman, Caparino Montesclaro. Next
the Fleet scored a narrow victory with “Young”
Narabo (7st. lllb.), whose speed and punching
power were too much for “Tich” Campbell (7st.
131 b.), his opponent. Alf Stewart (list. 121 b.) so
forcefully attacked Sailor Louis Corveleski (12st.
31b.), who chewed gum even at the worst extremity,
that Louis was fought to a standstill in the fifth
round, and Quirk stopped the fight. The Sammies
got even by beating Melbourne’s crack marksman
at rifle-shooting—a feat which they repeated in
Sydney.
“Riverina”: Two-np is flourishing in parts
of England, notably in the colliery districts of
Yorkshire, where schools are large and stakes high.
"SNOWY” ATKINSON, Vic. footballer
and cricketer.
In Blighty the kip-wielder is known as a “tosser,”
and the game as “pitch and toss,” but, as it is
played with two pennies or half-pennies, it seems
to be the same as Australia’s national gamble. In
England, however, some revenue is derived from
the ring-money, for along with street bookies and
other illicit operators professional “tossers” are not
exempt from income-tax. At Leeds a little while ago
one had his income from pitch and toss assessed
at £lOOO a year, and, although he protested, had
to spar up on that estimate. I am wondering if
the Tommies took the game home from Aussie camps
in France, and elsewhere, or if our forefathers brought
it out with them.

“Cain” (Lond.) : Watching the May races
at Cambridge, I found it difficult to discover a crew
rowing in the style that is known in Sydney as
“English.” My impression was that L. O. Robson,
the “Shore” headmaster and coach, produces a very
solid example of a crew rowing “English”
style as it is known to-day. The long reach forward
and the early grip of the water that mark King’s
School boats found no parallel at Cambridge; there
emphasis is thrown upon the securing of a powerful
and effective leg-drive, sacrificing, if necessary, a few
inches of “length.” A New South Wales or a
Murray Bridge (S.A.) crew would present greater
contrasts to a Thames eight. The Australian boats
are certainly shorter and the manipulation of the
finish is different. Cambridge itself is in the
throes of a controversy as to whether the blade
should be dropped or driven into the water. Jesus
College, champion of the “spring and draw” style,
remains head of the river. The Lady Margaret boat,
which was unlucky enough to lose its “blue,” Eliot
Smith, made its four bumps. Looking at the
crowded Cam., a few yards wide, one wondered
why we ever used to think we should like to
exchange the spacious Parramatta for a river with
a towpath.
* * * *
With Charlton out of the same. Johnny
Weismuller will have an easy time if the N.S.W.A.S.A.
brings him to Australia next year. Moss Christie
is the State’s next best, but he is a long way
behind the Yank. At Seattle last week, Weismuller
cut the world’s record for 100yds. (his own) by
2sec., swimming the distance in the wonderful time
of 50 2-ssec.

H. R. Sinclair, the Moore Park (N.S W.)
golfer, wound up a great season hrilliantlv by winning
the amateur championship of the continent for the
second year. He had previously carried off the
amateur, championship of N. S. Wales, and the
amateur and open championships of Queen land, and
tied for third place in the open championship of
Australia, besides being successful in foursomes and
"helping N. S. Wales to victory in the inter-State
match. And he is not yet 23. In the final for
the Commonwealth title, his opponent being George
Thompson, Sinclair did a round at Kensington in
71 and won by the astonishing margin of 12 up and
10 to play, A world-beater in the making, perhaps.

According to some U.S. critics, the Can-
adians Crocker and Wright have improved so greatly
as to have a good chance of dishing Australia in
the Davis Cup match. However, the Canadians did
nothing great in the tournament at Seabright, New
Jersey, Wright losing to Holman, the Stanford Uni.
youngster, whom Andersoii vanquished in his turn,
and Crocker going uiider in straight sets to Hawkes,
the weakest of the Australian three. But Seabright
made it clear that our men’s prospects of bringing
the Davis bauble back are very poor. Hawkes
proved no match for R. N. Williams, and the others
failed dismally against Vincent Richards, who over-
came Patterson, 6—3, 6—2, and Anderson, 6 —l,
4 —6, 6 —o, 6—o, the latter in the final. Also,
the brothers Kinsey, Howard and Robert, whipped
Patterson and Anderson in the doubles, 6—4, 6—4,
and were themselves licked rather easily by W. M.
Johnston and Griffin in the final. On this form,
another defeat is in store for our trippers in the
Davis Cup “struggle,” and another deficit for
the A.L.T.A.
The Westralians, who played such doughty
football at Hobart In 1924, have gone off lamentably
this year. In their return match with South Aus.
at Adelaide they never had a hope after the first
quarter, and were 44 points behind at the final bell—
South Aus., 12 goals 22 behinds; Westralia, 7 goals
8 behinds. Having beaten Victoria and Westralia
(twice), the Wheat Staters cannot now lose the
1925 championship.
* * * *
“Flicker”: At a football match in a S.
Aus. town the goal-umpire at one end was extremely
hard to please in the matter of angles. Time and
again the supporters of the visiting team shouted
joyfully as the ball soared—apparently—through the
major sticks, only to fall back and stare at one
another blankly as the goal umpire coldly waved
one flag, signifying a despised behind. The climax
came when the best of the visitors’ forwards got a
shot right in front of goal. Straight and true
soared the leather and a glad roar went up. But
to the horror of the supporters, again the umpire
waved one flag. Then in the stunned silence Bluey’s
voice raised in bitterness was heard, “It ain’t
right,” he protested. “Nobody ’as a right to ’ave
a one-armed blankard for goal-umpire,”
* * * *
Clhb football in Adelaide adjourned for
the Westraliatt Watch with the premiership in a, well-
balanced stage. The old-time rivals Norwood and
Port tie for the lead, but each has lost three games
out of 11 played. West Torrens (last year’s premiers)
and Sturt are next with four, lost; and West Adelaide
is close up ; the rest are nowhere. In goal-averages,
Norwood is easily best; in fact, by the luck of
tlie game, Port, tieing for top place, has got there
ih spite of scoring fewer goals and having more
scored against it than Sturt.
* * * *
Over 30,000 enthusiasts pushed into Vic-
toria Park (Vic.) on Saturday to see Collingwood
and Essendon battle for the third place in the
League competition, and a splendid exhibition of
ball ensued—on one side only. The Magpies are
determined to be in the final four this year, and
they gave a sweet exposition of systematic play,
backed by splendid marking and an impregnable
defence. Essendon, on the other hand, was off its
game. In the third quarter the ’Dons strove furiously
to reduce the deficit, but that only nerved the Magpies
to more strenuous play. They won by 109 points
to 29. Simultaneously, Fitzroy, which was but a
game behind ’Wood and ’Don, crashed before Foots-
cray, with 50 points to 91. The Maroons had just
returned from a trip to Tasmania and wore a tired
appearance. Geelong, burning to avenge its sole
defeat this year at the feet of North Melbourne,
visited the ex-gluepot and booted a mountain of
154 points to North’s 59, in a game that was so
willing that 17 charges have been laid against
various players by the umpires. Two ’bailers were
carried off unconscious, while a brick from outside
caught another on the knee. Melbourne utterly de-
stroyed St. Hilda’s premiership hopes by collecting
70 points to Saints’ 51, 'a battle royal among the
crowd attracting a lot more attention for a time
than the game. Richmond beat Hawthorn by 47
points to 29, and South Melbourne downed Carlton
by 74 to 63, but these disturbances interested only
club barrackers.
♦ •••••
“G. 0.8.”: After the disgraceful exhibition at North
Melbourne, the League’s independent tribunal should
make the penalty for foul play more severe. Once,
when owners of dirty lefts were rewarded with a
seat among the spectators for a year or two, a blow
in anger was rare; but now that a month or six
weeks is the penalty, ruffians use no restraint. The
tribunal’s job is made more difficult by the disinclina-
tion of players to give evidence against one another,
and the fact that the testimony of spectator’s is not
sought. When a charge is laid, the victim and his
mates generally pooh-pooh it, and sometimes a
tableau showing how an awkward attitude and the
vagaries of the ball made an accident seem an assault
is opposed to the umpire’s bald statement. The
re-introduction of stewards among the spectators to
watch for foul play, and a good old-fashioned severity
in dealing with offenders, would soon put League foot-
ball in a healthy state again.
* * * *
The Queenslanders made hacks of the
Maorilnnd Rugby Leaguers at Brisbane on Saturday.
Never at any stage did the Blacks look like winning;
at half-time the score was 28 to 3 against them:
at the finish it was 41 to 19. The “raking” of
Henderson robbed them of the ball, and Duncan
Thompson gave his backs a picnic. The triumphant
State was beaten in its last match against N.S.W.
at Sydney, whereas the Maorilanders defeated N. S.
Wales twice and should have lost the other
game. A punter who followed form in Rugby League
football would soon go broke.
* * * *
Sontli Svdnev, which is to meet Too-
woomba for the club championship, showed fine form
against St. George in the Rugby League competition
on Saturday. Johnston, who has been coaching a
country club, was back in his old position at half-
back, and helped the premiers to score 25 to 8.
St. George won the ball from the scrums repeatedly,
but in every other department South’s superiority
was marked. The other matches were likewise one-
sided, as the scores indicate: Western Suburbs 27,
Balmain 15; North Sydney 22, Newtown 11; Glebe
16, Eastern Suburbs 10.
THE ARMORED YANK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The U.S. sailors who gave a demonstration of
American football in Sydney on Saturday waddled on
to the field with pads on their elbows, shoulders,
chests, thighs, knees and shins. Their heads were
protected by leather helmets The Colorado
‘rooters’ sang: ‘Good-bye, Idaho, we’re going to kill
you now.’ ”
Is my armor on my elbows ? Are my shoulder
buffers fixed?
Is the dingus fastened firm across my chest?
Mediaeval fighting classes termed them corselets or
cuirasses,
But we like the less alarming “breastplate” best.
Heaven send there’s nothing shoddy in the leather
round my body,
For I go to meet a formidable foe,
And there haunts me, like a spectre, what Achilles
did to Hector.
Hark! the rooters chanting “Good-bye, Idaho.”
Pay attention to the buckles, if you please, and test
the straps;
See to every limb its shock-resister cleaves;
Keep an eye for holes and patchments in the thigh-
to-knee attachments
Familiar to our ancestors as greaves.
Is my helmet in condition sound and accurate posi-
tion ? ,
Is my vizor working smooth and comme it faut?
Then I’ll shuffle off instanter—waddle, for I cannot
canter —-
To where Colorado waits for Idaho.
There were eminent Cx’usaders, Cceur de Lion and
his crowd ;
There were glorious hidalgos like The Gid ;
There were gallant knights who jousted—sweated, too,
I’ll bet, and frowsted
In their clattering apparel as they did.
But your frame you must accoutre ’most as much for
Yankee footer,
The strenuous game that Yale and Harvard know.
Hark! the ravening Colorado rooters’ passionate
bravado
As they yell “We’re going to kill you, Idaho.”

“Clerk” : One of the new Tie. railway pub-
licity officer’s first jobs was to push Don
McGregor, of the Ballarat workshops, into
the limelight. Clapp was so impressed with
the neatness and tidiness of the shops that
he sooled Gollan and the railway photo-
grapher up to give the place a bit of a boost,
and as a result the dour Caledonian manager
is basking in the fierce light of fame. “Mac
started in the department 39 years ago, and
passed through practically every workshop
in the State. He has been a member of the
Ballarat Old Colonists’ Club for nearly four
decades, is high up in the Masonic world,
and proudly admits having ridden the same
bicycle to work for 25 years.
“M.H.” : Music has an honored place on
board ship. Every windjammer has an
accordion or something similar, and the
modern mailboat makes a feature of its
orchestra. On a C. and D. steamer I came
across a ship’s carpenter who could play
anything on the violin from jazz to opera,
and he played well —all by ear. His hands
were huge and clumsy looking, but their
touch on the strings could be as gentle as a
woman’s, and he could coax real music from
the common or garden saw. Years ago a
fireman on the old Medic conducted a tin-can
band that included about the weirdest assort-
ment of instruments ever gathered together ;
it monopolised the attention of the majority
of the passengers when it was in action. The
same fireman afterwards went down with the
Titanic.
“X2X”: Some conception of the infinite
slowness witli which evolutionary forces
work to bring about even the most minute
changes in the structures of living organ-
isms may be obtained from recent discoveries
of bacteria in Egyptian mummies. Though
the ages of these organisms ranged from
three to-four thousand years, it was impos-
sible to find the slightest differentiation in
their forms from those existing in the world
at the present day; for all practical pur-
poses they might have been cultures made in
some laboratory a few hours previously. Yet,
seeing that these organisms represent the
first forms of life and practically the start-
ing-point of life on the world, it is precisely
here that one would expect to find the forces
of biological adaptation and alteration, as
the result of environment, manifesting them-
selves. Since no apparent change has
occurred in these organisms during thou-
sands of years, one may wonder what count-
less a?ons it must have taken to effect changes
in the structures of the higher forms of life.
The problem might be kept in mind by those
who argue that acquired characteristics are
not capable of becoming permanent simply
because they have not done so within a few
generations.
“Kerys” : The man who looked like what
he wasn’t (B. 23/7/’25) reminds me of the
other extreme. There was one, a saintly-
looking old gentleman, who ran an
out-of-the-way bookshop; with his white
hair and velvet smoking-cap he seemed
to have stepped out of some old-
world romance. It was not until some years
after his death that lie was revealed as the
villain or a sensational divorce-case that
shook London society, a systematic wife-
heater, an ex-inmate of a Sydney gaol, a
clever swindler, in fact, an all-round scoun-
drel. Men of several nationalities looked him
up regularly to talk with one who spoke
tlieir tongue as fluently as his own,
and his articles in literary journals
were of exceptional quality. Incidentally,
he was an English baronet, but circumstances
made it injudicious for him to assume the
title, and a nephew who knew this remained
in undisputed possession of title and estates,
the actual baronet having, at a time of
stress, “died” officially some years before
and drawn, per his long-suffering wife, his
huge life insurance, which he completely and
unhesitatingly squandered.
A stalwart drunk who was challenging all
and sundry to fight in a Tait car in the
Morwell-Melbournc train struck a snag
when he tackled W. L. McKinnon, selected
Labor candidate for Walhalla, who was read-
ing quietly in a corner. “Go away, like a
good fellow,” said Mac. in reply to the
intoxicated person’s appeals to “come on,”
but when a knife was flashed the prospective
candidate, who is a well-known amateur
boxer, got in a straight left, knocked his
opponent out, picked up and pocketed the
weapon. “Wish it was as easy to win a seat
in Parliament,” he said.
“ILK.”: I have encountered him at last
—the real philosopher. He was waiting
dreamily for a Circular Quay tram at one of
Sydney’s busiest intersectional points. Sud-
denly he decided to catch a car that was
just moving off. But “he got away badly,”
and when he made his leap and grab at the
handrail he missed, and fell in a dishevelled
and bruised heap on the road. The tram
went on and the dazed citizen struggled to
his feet and gazed after it. Suddenly a
smile illumined his rugged countenance.
“Ah, well,” he sighed, “it was goin’ to Miller’s
Point, any’ow.”
“Tabac” : Under the N.S.W. Justices Act
it is sufficient for the description of any
offence in an information or complaint to be
in the words of the Act, order, by-law, regu-
lation or other document creating it, or in
similar words, and it is not now necessary
to negative the exemptions, exceptions and
qualifications that are set out in the statu-
tory description. Notwithstanding this fact
one occasionally meets with instances where
the old practice is followed. Such an in-
stance cropped up in an out-back court a few
weeks ago, when a complaint was lodged
against, say, Sarah Breton, by one John
Jones. It read as follows :
The said John Jones complains that on the sixth
day of February in the year of our Lord one
thousand nine hundred and twenty-five, at , in
the said State of New South Wales, certain goods, to
wit one muscovy duckling, the value of which is
not greater than £2O, to wit of the. value of one
shilling, and not being deeds, muniments or papers
relating’ to any property of greater value than £5O,
and to the possession of which the said John Jones
claims to be entitled, are detained by one Sarah
Brown without ju»t cause and after due notice of
the claim made by the said John Jones.
Some modern Dr. Johnson may think that
document worth a few shillings—if it doesn’t
define a muscovy duckling it is at least valu-
able testimony as to what a muscoVy duck-
ling is not.

«
There are few women off the stage like
Irene Vanbrugh on the stage, and there
are fewer still like Pauline Frederick;
but there are millions like Nellie Bramley;
which is a testimonial to Nellie. This
critic confesses to being a blank page on
Saturday night, as far as the last-named
lady was concerned; and his impression is
that she is a comedienne of quality. Her
equipment includes a flexible voice, more
facial expressions than there are phases of
the moon, and a robust and unsophisticated
manner. _ In the present exhibit, “Fair and
Warmer,” at the Sydney Palace, she takes
the part of one of those good-natured,
faithful creatures who are the bul-
wark of the nation; and without a great deal
of assistance from Avery Hopwood’s manu-
script she succeeds in being as funny as
anything, and frequently even funnier.
Assisting her in the mirth-provoking business
is Arthur Cornell, as a banker whose natu-
rally warm heart has been beating all his
married life under a cold official manner.
The lady owns a spouse (George Hewlett)
who spends his evenings at a card-club under
the pretence of attending Masonic meetings;
and the banker possesses a wife (Sylvia
McNair) whose ardor, having failed to molt
Iter husband’s upper crust, drives her to
seek sympathy and understanding (Philip
Evans) elsewhere. The two objects of
neglect, being left alone in the flat of one
of them, solace themselves in an unwonted
manner with cocktails and champagne, and
an entire act is given over to the process of
“THE STREET SINGERAT HER
MAJESTY’S , SYDNEY.
Vera Spaull as Estelle, an unattached
young person.
inebriation. The final act is a harrowing-
picture of the morning after, lightened by
clever comedy by Beryl Barraclough, as a
maid who has served prairie oysters to sore-
headed employers before; and over-burdened
by some unjustifiable farce by Guy Hastings
and William McGowan as two slap-stick
furniture-removers. The final upshot is that,
all the wives and husbands are reconciled
to one another, and everything ends snappily.
The innocent bit of nonsense, on its first
showing some time ago, shocked Sydney, but
Sydney has since grown up, apparently. She
has also since been punished for her exces-
sive delicacy by having “Spring Cleaning,”
and plays of a more bawdy tendency and
without half the amount of fun, forced on
her. Besides the excellent contribution of
Nellie Bramley, there was some good work
done by George Hewlett as her husband,
although he would do better joinery if he
refrained from driving his tacks home w r ith
a steam-hammer. Arthur Cornell was strik-
ing as the self-restrained banker, sober; and
consistent as tne same person, nali-seas over.
Edna Thomas opened her Sydney season
at tne Town Hall witli excerpts irum
Brahms, Schumann and Tschaikowsky, as
well as negro spirituals. Edna, rather
swamped by tne Town Hall atmospnere, was
not so effective as Sydney has known her in
more intimate hails. In the classical num-
bers the singer was pleasant but not dis-
tinctive. However, in her plantation songs
and “spirituals,” rendered atmospheric by
spreading crinolines in red and green, she
again captured her audience. A clever new-
comer, Lucile Lawrence, twanged “that
rather exploded instrument, the harp,” as
somebody called it, in a potpourri of melody ;
and Constance Piper rendered first aid at
the piano.

“Veronique” is to be revived by the Mos-
man Musical Society at the local Town Hall.
There will be six performances of the dainty
comic opera, the first on Saturday night.
Dorothy Ilelmrich gave the first of her two
home-coming recitals at the Oonservatorium
last Thursday. The Sydney girl, who left
Australia with a rich mezzo and a musical
intellect out of the ordinary, has returned
a mellow 7 artist whose powers of interpreta-
tion never failed to grip her listeners. In
a programme that started with such early
English composers as Purcell, Byrd and
Thomas Morley, and went on to Schubert,
Moussorgsky and Vaughan Williams, the
singer skimmed light and shade, shallow 7 and
depth, literally on wings of song. The Syd-
ney girl is possessed of distinction, vocalisa-
tion that is pretty well perfect, and the art
that makes intricate works sound simple.
Vera Barnett supplied the accompaniments,
and Gladstone Bell’s ’cello added its rich
notes to the evening.
The U.S.A. Navy’s contribution to the
Tivoli this week (and its prize exhibit)
was Hajnos, a Samson in bell-bottomed
trousers. He fiddled about w 7 ith a 2501 b.
dumb-bell as if it w r ere an airy trifle, cracked
lOin. nails between his molars, weaved crow-
bars into fantastic shapes around his neck,
and finally adjusted an anvil on his bosom
and encouraged a couple of men to beat upon
it with sledge-hammers. Zorondo La Bella,
a Spanish-American damsel, sings and
changes a wardrobe of clothing in public;
the diverse views of the lady in various
stages of disrobing score the bigger hit.
Ernest Hastings retails some jokes that have
not yet seen print on this side of the globe.
The toe-tripping of Athol Tier is a night-
mare of grotesque movements, and the whim-
sicalities of Milton Hayes retain a deal of
freshness.
Proceedings at Sydney Fullers’ were en-
livened during the earlier part of this week
by the orchestra from the U.S.A. Idaho.
As jazz-purveyors they more than held their
own. Alex. Kelleway, singer, implored some
kind-hearted soul to send him a blue bird;
if he persists with “Friend of Mine” and
“Hard-hearted Hannah” he may get some-
thing in the feathered line. Videau and
Kirby caricature with success the evergreen
“Merry Widow” waltz, while J. E. Sutton
taps the piano keys with the skill expected
of a compatriot of Paderewski. Others who
pass muster are the tireless Eleven Wonders,
Leo Sterling, the peripatetic minstrel, and
Southwood w 7 ith his charming partner in pink.

The U.S. perdoocer is returning to Civil
War films, as witness D. W. Griffith’s “Love
and Sacrifice,” at Hoyt’s. Sydney Dis a
wild, disjointed affair, and the sub-titles are
nearly as long as S. M. Herald leaders, but
the picture exhibits some of Griffith’s merits
as well as his defects. The Strand has
“Sackcloth and Scarlet,” exploiting a theme
which lost its interest about the time Federa-
tion was introduced in Austral'a, but movie
audiences are not an exacting lot. Early
Christians are still on the lions’ menu in
“Quo Vadis,” at the Crystal Palace, and
Rudolph Valentino, as the conceited Due de
Chartres, struts his way through “Monsieur
BeauCaire,” at the Prince Edward’s. He is
a more ceremonious Rudolph than the one
who darkened his complexion to start the
Sheik ci-aze, and “Monsieur Beaucaire” is
a better picture than the mushy “Ten Com-
mandments,” though it may not run so long.

Galleries, Sydney, is apt to look at nature with the
poster eye, and when he does the impression made by
his work is evanescent. He knows, however, how to
charge his brush with fresh, clean pigment, and
when he remembers he is painting pictures and not
hoardings the result, as in No. 20, “Halcyon Days,”
and No. 25, “The Bathing Place,” is harmonious
and pleasing. No. 24, “The River at Ryde,” is
full of old-gold light and evening warmth, but in
No. 38, “Monday,” a study of last week’s washing
drying on the line, the blue has run out of the
lingerie into the firmament without justification.
Robert Johnson, who is co-partner in the exhibition,
is a solider performer, and in No. 1 has drawn with
skill a fine mist of leafless fruit-trees in the glow
of afternoon. There is nice perspective in
No. 2, and in No. 6, a cow-yard seen over that
most unresthetie feature of the Australian landscape, a
paling fence, he has made out of uncompromising
materials a pretty picture. The Lake Wakatipu
of No. 12 is not as usually seen by Maoriland artists,
who all appear to paint their native country under
instructions from the Tourist Bureau in Wellington.
“Wildflower,” at Melbourne Theatre Royal,
has a sweetness reminiscent of the days be-
fore musical comedy declined into revue.
Nina Benedetto, the choicest bud in a re-
markably decorative Lombardy village, learns,
shortly after she has proposed to a backward
lover in picturesque velvet garments, that her
wealthy grandfather has left her his entire
fortune on condition that she does
not lose her temper for six months.
Attached as she is to her country life
and her peasant sweetheart, it is only
the sneers of her cousin, the city-bred Bianca,
who is the alternative heiress, that determine
her to accept the conditions of the will and
transfer herself to the sumptuous villa left
by her grandfather. There the united efforts
of her cousin, the cousin’s betrothed (who
wants her money), and the lawyer and his
wife, who will benefit, fail to make her fly
off the handle; but the conspirators very
nearly succeed, on the last night of her test
term, by making fun of her lover, who has
come to see her, and, after failing in that,
by breeding misunderstanding between them.
Twelve o’clock strikes in time to enable the
highly-tried lady to lose her temper all round
without losing her fortune; and in her anger
against Guido, Nina decides to marry
Bianca’s lover, Alberto, who is perfectly
satisfied as long as he gets the cash—he ex-
plains that he is too delicate to work. Com-
plications are cleared up in the third act,
however, and the bright affair finishes on the
usual note of happiness.
* * * *
The chief successes were with Marie Bui'ke
and Gus Bluett. Although the lady might
have been a bit more tempestuous in the re-
lease of her banked-up anger, she is a vola-
tile and captivating Nina. Gus Bluett, an
easy, natural comedian, gets all the laughs
allotted to the part of Gabrielle, and some of
his own. Charles Zoli succeeds as the com-
placent lawyer and harassed husband of
Lucrezia la Roche (Marie la Varre), and
the sometimes almost insupportable stiffness
of Herbert Browne as Guido is redeemed by
his excellent singing. Marjorie Daw is an
attractive Bianca, and good work is done by
John Horde as Luigi, Nina’s foster-father.
As Alberto, No'el Allan is only fair. Some
cheers are due to the Colemans and George
Upward for the stage settings.
** * *
“Back Again” is the title of the new Lee
White show at the Melbourne Athenajum;
but some of the lady’s old numbers are so
popular that the audience insisted upon repe-
titions. A highly entertaining “Greek Scene,”
and “School Days” were amongst the best
ingredients, and Ernest Sefton did some ex-
tremely good work from the house side of
the footlights in “Enter the Comic,” whilst
Billie Lockwood showed up specially in
“We’ve Got a Servant” and “Piccadilly
Jim.” Some “Southern Melodies” were put
over in an artistic fashion by Reg Dandy,
Clay Smith and Lee White. Saranova is no
great star as a danger, but her work was
pleasing enough.
The best tribute to the popularity and
wide appeal of “No, No, Nanette,” at the
New Princess, is heard when the early milk-
man whistles as he rattles his pails that
he “wants to be happy,” and the boarding-
house cook hums the same desire amidst
the clatter of breakfast preparations.
A breakdown of the always-excellent
Arthur Styan was a misfortune which
struck “The Pelican,” at Melbourne King’s,
last week; Sydney Stirling filled the gap
creditably. Otherwise the show goes on
evenly; and the people who always like to
see Muriel Starr do crass and wrong-headed
things in the first act so that she can weep
about them in the last are not missing the
new opportunity.
** * *
The curtain falls on “Snap,” after a
lengthy run at the New Palace, Melbourne,
at the end of this week. Kenneth Duffield’s
new song, “The Sun Will Shine,” as given
by Howett Worster, has been one of its
features.
** * *
Laughter continues to step lightly in “Kid
Boots” at His Majesty’s.

Having their “positively farewell” con-
cert last Saturday, Althouse and Middleton
were called upon to give an “extra concert”
on Tuesday; by this time the melodious pair
will have passed from Melbourne. Middle-
ton’s most popular goods were “The Song
of the Volga Boatmen” and Leoni’s “Tally
Ho.” A special success of Althouse’s
was the gracefully sung “The Sigh” (Du-
pare). Another item of interest was the
“My Little House of Dreams,” by the local
composer, Dudley Glass—quite a dainty
musical offering.

proposes to charm Melbourne with a violin.
His first concert is on August 15.

can be a good or

It is a bad habit to

away the enamel and
make way for decay.

A conjurer of special note at Melbourne
Tivoli is Gus Fowler, who produces watches
in wholesale quantities from nowhere, and
alarm-clocks, all ringing, from the inevitable
magic belltopper. .Jones and Raine, a pair
of Australians., do some very clever work
with a piano, and Harry Green, who finishes
this week, has a new sketch. The melodious
“Big Four” have improved their turn by
scrapping the material to which objection had
to be expressed two weeks ago.
* * *
The dangers of • conviction upon cir-
cumstantial evidence are emphasised in
"Ai*e You Guilty?” at Hoyt’s De
Luxe, Melbourne, and “The Sign of
the Cactus” has some good points. The
Majestic, where the popular little vio-
linist Maggie Foster helps the interval
through, shows “Slave of Destiny,” adapted
from Balzac’s “Magic Carpet”; a new’ dog
star, one Buck, acts in the Jack London
story “The Call of the Wild.” This saga-
cious animal,, a St. Bernard-collie cross, is
a rival to Rin-Tin-Tin, whose shadow’ flicks
across the screen at Hoyt’s New Gaiety in
“My Dad.” “Sally” has stepped on to the
screen at the Paramount. Colleen Moore is
in the Josie Melville part; an Australian in
Leon Errol, whose success in America w r as
chronicled in a recent Poverty Point para-
graph, makes his first film appearance as the
Duke of Checkergovinia.
* * g:
“Primrose,” at Adelaide Royal, is a
marked improvement on its predecessor.
Thoroughly English and healthy, it presents
the joy of life with a riot of dancing (not-
ably by Michael Cunningham and Hazel
Clements) and a feast of color, especially
where Maud Fane and a whole chorus are
changed by a trick of lighting from planters
to niggers and back at will. William Senior
is the serious singing hero type, better known
20 years back than recently, and the fun
is in the capable hands of Winnie Collins
and the hard-working Blake Adams. Also
Hugh Steyne gets a chance at last, and Rita
Nugent is promoted to a speaking part. The
astonishing “Ten Commandments” is in a
fourth week (local record) at Wondergrapli.
At West’s is Stella Power singing, and the
amazing duel with boulders in “The Waste-
land” on the screen. At the York, Jane
Novak and Larry Semon attract in their
various ways, and at the Pav. Laurette Tay-
lor’s sweetness is oddly contrasted with real
Flying Fists.
From an Adelaide critic:—
The Phillips Fox show at the Society of Arts is
a success. The Art Gallery has in the past bought
three Fox pictures, and is barred by its own rules
from buying any more, but the public is doing its
bit. This collection of the dead painter’s work
includes some enormous pictures that have been
seen in the Salon of Paris and the Royal Academy
of London; also numerous studies in liis pet effect
of bringing blobs of bright sunlight through foliage,
notably in the instance of one large and masterly
nude. The work of Mrs. Fox has its admirers, too,
and in one case might easily be taken for that of
her late husband. Her best picture is a powerful
head of a Belgian nun.
“Roka”:. It lias become the fashion for
the theatrical world to tilt at that good old
standby, “East Lynne.” As the taste of all
theatregoers, highbrow and otherwise, is apt
to change very decidedly, perchance someone
will explain the reason of “East Lynne’s”
evergreen appeal. Lots of the Pinero plays,
excellent as they are, have become old-
fashioned and out of date; Wilde is thread-
bare ; Shaw bores innumerable people who
once boomed him, and other famous play-
wrights have apparently produced nothing
that is going to last. But “East Lynne” is
never off the boards in the English-speaking
world. Why ?
“Hamfat”: Having cut away from the
Firm, comedian Alf Frith (in whose parts
Blake Adams is now appearing) has plunged
into journalism, with the assistance of artist
Dennis Connelly: and Frith’s made its ap-
pearance in Melbourne last Saturday. The
little paper is moulded on the lines of London
Opinion, and its first number is sufficiently
bright; but Alfred is at a disadvantage in
being unable to supplement his comments
with a codfish grin.

“R.K.D.N.”: The production of a play
by Judge Beeby brings to mind a quaint
coincidence. In St. John Ervine’s comedy,
“Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary,” an actress,
Mary Westlake, is the central figure. To-
wards the end of the piece a Mr. Beeby is
introduced, and the “contrary” heroine an-
nounces that, instead of accepting an ambi-
tious piece written by her lover, she has
decided to produce “a bad, but money-making
play,” of which Mr. Beeby is the author.
And Beeby is by no means a common name.
“Hamfat”: Arthur Styan’s silver beard
has come off, and it is artificial lip-whisker
he sports as General Heriot in “The Peli-
can.” Sickness has come upon the veteran,
who is compelled these days to keep himself
on a strict diet; and a nervousness associated
with his illness gave him an inclination to
“fluffiness” in his opening speeches in the
new play. As it happened, the uncertainty
fitted in with the character of the mentally-
disturbed military man, and Styan was artist
enough to put it to use. I remember another
actor who, realising that he was considerably
“shot” and was showing it, interpolated the
explanation : “This woman has driven me to
drink.” After that his alcoholic tremor,
which might otherwise have annoyed the
audience, was put down to good acting, and
the mummer gathered a few extra “rounds.”
Perhaps he deserved them.
“Lysander”: Gladys Webster owes no
gratitude to whoever cast her for Mrs.
Draper in “So This Is London.” Her Inez
Villera in “The Broken Wing,” coming after
her diffident, stilted Mrs. Draper, was a re-
velation. She was so vivacious and appeal-
ing, so completely mistress of emotion and
fun, that one could only wonder what freak
of casting made her Mrs. Draper in that
earlier Hall offering. Any stick could have
played Mrs. Draper—in fact, the stickier the
better.
“Te Tangata Pai” : An old-timer now on
the staff of a Sydney cinema theatre is Mick
Jones, in his day a first-class circus clown
and as daring an acrobat as ever threw a
“double.” Thousands have thrilled and held
their breath while Mick turned a double
somersault over 20 pairs of fixed service
bayonets pointed upward by a score of men.
After the disbandment of Fitzgerald’s circus
Jones was doing a William Tell act at
Wonderland, Bondi, when his rifle back-
fired, blowing the breach clean out and lay-
ing his cheek open. Mick sat quietly while
the doctor sewed him up. “What, you haven’t
done,” said the patient as Scalpel showed
signs of leaving. Being assured that the job
was over. “Over?” he repeated. “Why, I
thought you were going to stitch it.” “Pluck-
iest chap I ever attended,” said Scalpel after-
wards. “I had put 12 stitches in the
wound.”
“The Deacon” : The Maoriland show which
didn’t open till 10 at night (B. 23/7/’25)
reminds me of one T was present at in Cen-
tral Queensland. A concert co. was doing
the smalls while Bananaland was in the
throes of an election campaign. A heavy-
gun speaker clashed with the co. in a small
town, and there being only the one hall a
compromise was effected: the gasbag was
GOING TOO FAR.
FITZGLOOM : “I’m doing ‘ Hamlet ’ next week without scenery.”
BOOMER: “Heavens, laddie, but you can’t do Shakspeare without
scenery and acting!”
to have the hall till 9 o’clock and then the
performers could get under way. But the
politician is too windy a man to stop easily,
and it was well after 10 when the meeting
closed. Then, as one man, the crowd
melted into the pub to sample the buekshee
booze. A few had the decency to come lack,
and the show went on until well into the
next day.
“Machete”: One of the Veterans of
Variety now in Australia will doubtless re-
member a co. which tenanted the old Bris-
bane Gaiety in the ’nineties. It consisted
of some American minstrels of assorted
color, several capable if rather dejected
female “artistes,” a “German” comedian, a
“Jew” ditto and a Scottish singer. The
manager was a saddle-colored mulatto,. with
a tremendous voice. Prices were a shilling,
sixpence and threepence; and business was
horrible. Someone thought of a benefit for the
unhappy crew. The sports responded gal-
lantly, a decent sum was collected, and a
bumper house at the thunderous charges of
35., 2s. and Is saw the cheque handed over.
The mulatto made a tearful speech. The
company, he explained, had prolonged its
stay in Brisbane because it could get no
money to leave. Now it had deputed him to
go to Sydney and engage a galaxy of addi-
tional attractions for a grand farewell sea-
son in gratitude to Brisbane’s sports. He
left for Sydney all right, but neither he nor
the cash was ever heard of again.
“Hamfat”: Melbourne has at least two
prosperous citizens who owe their suburban
residences and motor-cars to the jobs they
once held as theatre ushers. Ushers. drew
a modest half-crown a performance in the
old days, but “perks” were plentiful. There
were regular tips from people who utilised
the cloakrooms (then free), as well as for
finding seats and programmes. Moreover,
ushers would speculate in seats on big occa-
sions, and were sometimes able to get fancy
prices ; while a side-line was arranging intro-
ductions between stage-dazzled patrons and
agreeable chorus beauties. But the old-time
opportunities have been regulated out of
existence. Decent salaries are now paid to the
house-staffs, and the generality of playgoers,
being required to fork out for programmes
and the like, as well as being stung heavily
for good seats, have -ceased to remunerate
attendants; furthermore, managements frown
upon any exploitation but their own. At
one theatre recently a patron reported that,
although he had been told at the bqx-office
it was a case of standing-room only, an usher
had offered to find him seats for £2 apiece.
The speculator was sacked.
“Lud”: The late William Archer did not
cease his efforts in playwriting after his
“Green Goddess”
had turned out
su c h a money-
spinner. Another
piece by the critic-
dramatist was pro-
duced recently by
Robert Courtneidge
for a trial trip at
M anch ester ‘ ‘Th e
Joy Ride.” The
play combines
melodrama with
grim humor, and
seems to have satis-
fi e d all require-
ments, for Court-
neidge announces a
London production
in the autumn.
“L.E.”: protests
against the revival
of certain Elizabe-
than and Restora-
tion plays (B.
23/7/’25) began
with the Phoenix
Society’s produc-
tion of Webster’s
“The Duchess of
Malfi,” and still
continue, though
they are no more
reasonable than
protests against
some of the master-
pieces in the
Louvre or the Na-
tional Gallery. I
saw T two Restora-
tion comedies pro-
duced by the Phoe-
nix, Dryden’s de-
lightful “Marriage
it la Mode,” and
Congreve’s “Love
for Love,” one of
the wittiest com-
edies in the langu-
age. An Anglican
clergyman, Monta-
gue Somers, helps
to select and
arrange many of
the plays for the
Phoenix. Asked at a
matinee by some
earnest person
about Congreve’s
obscenity, lie replied lightly that the audi-
ence took no notice of it. “It falls off them,”
he said, “like water from a duck’s back.”
“Hamfat”: Turbulent spirits in small
country towns are prone to amuse themselves
by being rude to reserved-seaters. The ap-
pearance of Denny Dunbar in his best clothes
escorting the barmaid from the Royal into
the front seats is too often a signal for
derisive cheers; and in a town where every-
body knows everybody else there are other
opportunities for sarcasm at the expense of
those whose pretensions annoy the gods.
The one man I remember who could effectu-
ally quieten a riotous gallery was advance-
agent Alec Anderson. Anderson had a fine,
well-conditioned bulldog with a face like an
ultimatum. When the gods were obstreper-
ous Beauty would be introduced, placed on
the handiest high pedestal and told to smile.
His cavernous jaws would open at the com-
mand, and an awed silence invariably settled
on the gods.
THE MASCOT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It, was an actor and his joss,
And heartily he thumped it;
His eye was wild; his words were... .cross;
He vowed that fame wa's useless dross,
The pit’s applause not worth one toss
Of beer as Hebe pumped it.
They tried his confidence to win,
To end his strange behaving,
To still his most unholy din
With smelling-salts and Holland gin;
He paused, but only to begin
A louder bout of raving.
And still, with many a fearsome swear,
He whaled into that idol,
(A little heathen-god affair
With slitted eyes and slanting stare,
And folded hands on belly bare),
While notions homicidal
Awoke within his heated brain,
By fury all but melted.
“Behold!” he said, and then again
“Behold!” he cried like one in pain;
“Why, damme, it’s as plain as plain.”
And still that joss he belted.
At last, in words to understand,
His troubles he recited.
“You saw,” he said, with phrases banned,
“You saw” (the very air was tanned),
“You saw I never got a hand
In all that house beknighte'd.”
“And why should this occur to me?”
He wailed in tones dramatic;
“To me.... Fitz Maurice Maccabee,
Whom critics laud in major key?
’Twas through this heathen effigy,
This” (Rumble here of ‘static.’)
“ ‘An unknown but admiring miss’ 1
(So wrote the one who sent it)
‘Would know a moment’s utter bliss,
Transcending any lover’s kiss,
A mascot should you make of this’
(You’d swear she surely meant it).
“ ‘A god it is for heathen blind,
All kindness does it figure;
I trust that you will always find
Your audiences just as kind.’
My soul!” raged Fitz. “No loving mind
Devised that ruddy jigger.”
“Just look at it.” he wildly cried,
“Don’t stand like senseless dummies!
Ye gods! Her wish was well supplied—
An audience just like this.... Cross-eyed,
With hands unmoving... .folded... .tied
Across their blasted tummies.”
It was an actor and his joss,
And heartily he thumped it;
That unperturbed and smiling joss,
That slit- and slant-eyed, genial joss,
Cross-armed and -legged Celestial joss,
' Into the dirt he dumped it.

MARINE WIRELESS
Not only have the high seas been made safer by wireless,
but new social and commercial services have been placed
at the disposal of those who travel. The barriers of
distance no longer isolate passengers from their friends
ashore—cheap telegraphic facilities are available, while
the daily ocean newspaper disseminafes news of the
world’s activities.
The installation, operation and maintenance of ships’
wireless stations, and of coastal radio stations throughout
Australia and New Guinea necessitates an organisation
experienced in every technical phase of wireless develop-
ment and of commercial radio traffic handling.
Such an organisation is Amalgamated Wireless—Aus-
tralian-owned, operated and controlled. Its objective is
to apply its resources to the development of the new art
to the greatest possible service of the Australian people.

AUDITORS’ REPORT.
WE have examined the above Balance Sheet, made up to 30th June, 1925, and report that we find the
several items therein stated to conform to the Balances in the General Ledger and the Balance
Sheets of the respective Branches of the Bank collectively.
We have counted the Cash and examined the Bills held by the Bank at the Head Office in Sydney
on the 30th June, 1925, and hereby certify that we have found them correct. We further certify that all
Vouchers, Accounts and Documents necessary for verifying the Balance Sheet have been submitted to us.
The Cash, Bills and other Securities held at the Branch Banks in New South Wales, Queensland;,
Vic toria and South Australia on the date of Balancing have been certified to as being correct by the usual
documents, and the figures of the Balance Sheet of the London Branch have been received by cable.
In our opinion the above is a full and fair Balance Sheet, containing the particulars required bi
the Articles of Association of The Australian Bank of Commerce Limited, and is properly drawn up so as
to exhibit a true and correct view of the state of the Company’s affairs as shown by the Books o
the Company.

The Annual General Meeting of the Shareholders of The Australian Bank of Commerce Limited was
held to-day, Tuesday, 28th July, 1925, at the Banking House, King and George Streets, Sydney, Mr.
H. R. Lysaght, 0.8. E., Acting Chairman of Directors, presiding.
In moving the adoption of the Report and Balance Sheet, the Chairman said: —
“Gentlemen: —It is owing to the absence of our chairman, Sir Mark Sheldon, in London, that I am
taking the chair to-day.
“The Balance Sheet this year discloses several features of special importance.
“Inscribed Deposits are reduced from £1,245,000 to £244,000- —a decrease of just over £1,000,000
—while Capital Account is increased from £1,200,04)0 to £1.840,000, and the Reserve Fund from
£370,000 to £740,000 —this fund having thus been exactly doubled since last year.
“The increase in thq Reserve Fund is made up of the following transfers: —
Out of the profits of the year . . . . . . • • • • £50,123 17 0
From surplus on Inscribed Deposits converted into Shares .. 319,434 15 0
From surplus realised on 1128 shares issued .. .. .. 441 8 0
Total .. .. £370,000 0 0
“I do not think it necessary, at this stage, to refer at length to the offer made to the Inscribed
Depositors to convert their Deposits into Shares on the basis of two Shares, fully paid up, for each £3
of Inscribed Deposit. It was availed of, as has been announced in the Press, by more than 300*0
individual holders, representing over £958,000. The offer has been favorably commented on by both
the Press and the Public in this country and in Great Britain ; and one of the results has been the
increase in the Reserve Fund, as stated, by over £319,000.
“The fact that the Bank has done more than it was obliged to do in improving the position
of the Inscribed Depositors has no doubt added to its standing generally, and your Directors are
satisfied that their action has been as much to the benefit of Shareholders as of Inscribed Depositors.
This is shown by the enhanced price of the Shares in the Market.
“Sir Mark Sheldon’s presence in London was of material assistance in carrying the scheme through
there, as he was able to attend all the meetings of Depositors.
“Referring to the Balance Sheet generally', it will be noted that liabilities to the Public, consisting
of Customers’ Deposits, Bills in Circulation, etc., which on the 30th June, 1924, were £11.592,000, are
now £12,443,000 —an increase of over £850,000. This increase indicates a general and very satisfactory
growth and development during the year.
“On the Assets side, Cash and other items of a specially liquid character now total £5,823,000, as
compared with £4,694,000 a year ago, and are equal to 9s. 4d. in the £ on our outside liabilities —
a position indicating the strength of the Bank’s finances.
“Advances at £9,138,000 and Bank Premises £434,000 show moderate reductions of £228,000
and £4OOO respectively.
“The totals of the Balance Sheet now for the first time exceed £15,000,000 —the figure being
£15,395,000 —an increase of £896,000.
“After provision of an increased amount for taxation, the profits amount to £lBO,OOO, as compared
with £143,000 last year, and, after transfer of £50,123 to Reserve Fund and £lO 000 m reduction ol
Bank Premises Account, permit a final half-yearly dividend at the rate of 8 per cent, pel annum.
“The dividend mentioned leaves £5,041 18s. 7d. out of the year’s profits to increase the amount
to be carried forward—raising the latter to £54,559 17s. lOd. Thus the year has been one of sati-
factory progress generally. _
“It is a matter of interest to the Shareholders to note that during the past seven years the rat
of dividend has been gradually and steadily increased from three to eight per cent.
“The Season generally ha's been good, and prospects are favorable in most parts of Australia.
“After a period of extremely high prices, the Market for Wool has shown a halting tendency, and
a considerable reduction in values has followed. The price now being obtained for fine w T ools, how T evei.
is still favorable as compared with many past years, and it is hoped that the present range of values
will at any rate be maintained. . , ,
“A good Market has ruled during the season for Wheat, and this, with the large crop secured, ha
benefited growers very considerably. .
“There has been a slight improvement in the Cattle Market, but there is still much to be desired
in this direction. .
“An abundant Sugar crop has been harvested, both in the Northern districts of New South Wales
and in Queensland, the quantity of Sugar produced being not only sufficient for local requirements, but
leaving a large surplus for export. The ‘preference’ arrangements which have recently been re-introduced
in England have been of material benefit to Australia in enabling this surplus to be disposed of at a
considerably higher price than would otherwise have been the case.
“Since we last met the Exchange position became most difficult and special measures were needec
to ensure the marketing overseas of our primary products. The. reintroduction of the Gold Exchange
Standard, how’ever, has now brought about normal rates, and the difficulties that have been experiences
since the War are at an end for the time being.
“We would like again to raise a note of warning in connection with the borrowing of both Federal
and State authorities. These debts to-day are in the vicinity of £1,000,000.000 (One thousand million
pounds), and to this must be added the very large borrowdngs of other public bodies. The interest on
these debts is becoming a burden which the community can, with difficulty, bear. If the population were
increasing in the same ratio the position would not be so serious, but this is not so, the debt per head
every year being higher than in the previous year.
“In conclusion I may say that your Directors look forward with every confidence to the future of
the Bank.”
The motion was seconded by Dr. Geo. J. Slv and carried unanimously.
Mr. H. R. Lysnght, 0.8. E., and Sir Mark Sheldon, K.8.E., were re-elected Directors; and Messrs.
William H. Perry, F.0.P.A., and William Craig, F.C.P.A., were appointed Auditors.
A hearty vote of thanks to the Directors, General Manager and Staff was moved by Mr. H. A.
Brigg and carried by acclamation.
The Chairman declared the dividend is now payable.

unless stamps accompany.
R.H.L.: Verse too rugged.. . .Archie C.:
The verse falls a long way short and the themes are
much overworked... .E.D. (Perth): “The Bargain”
misses. In that form everything is marred if the
language does not convey the meaning with absolute
clearness and simplicity... .H.W.M.H.: The yarn
treads old ground and is in very rough shape... .
Yardley: “The Scotchman” must return... .J.J.: No
use to u 5.... Eric F.: Not well enough done....
Buttcnderry: Hardly possible to tell what the yarn
means F.W.T.: Can’t find mirth in that solemn
and tired jesting... .Frances T.: Terrifying verse....
WC. (Nedlands) : Not for us Thomas E.: The
“Case” is not exactly entertaining. All it contains
could have been better said in about 50 words;
and it wouldn’t have been worth saying M. 0.8.:
Says a good deal that is extravagant, but nothing
new... .F.E.R.: They miss, but not by a mile....
Tonburke: The verse doesn’t improve on the para-
graph. .. .F.S.S.: Not exactly “silly,” but there isn’t
nearly enough in it... . J.S.T.: They all have points
and all miss Babs: The yarn is too childish....
M.W.M.: Hasn’t the feeling; and the verse itself is
only fair.... Bellerive: A fine summing up of the
general sporting situation:—
Golf and tennis are famous. And on a mild summer
Day,
’Tis attractive to watch smart rivals at play.
Cricket also is a game of great skill.
But give me football to createth a thrill.
When straight for a goal sails the ball through the
air,
There’s loud wafting cheers and groans of Despair,
Good players are often knocked out from a fall.
But ’tis all in the game of exciting football.
... .Elman: The point is too thin... .Alan S.:
Nicely done in its way, but not our sort E. 8.:
(Camberwell) : Slight and lumpy... .T.N.8.: All are
a bit crude and commonplace... .A.W. (Manly): The
schemes don’t move us... .Tahuna: Some of the verse
is very ragged and there is very little fresh in
the setting J.'M.A.: Falls rather heavily over its
own feet... .Douglas C.: Not worth while... .G.R.M.:
Weary commonplaces in poor verse... .N.B. (Nor-
wood) : “The Storm” is weak repetition of old things.
....Margaret C.: One is rather musical prose; the
other is far too thin and slight. .. .C.H.M.: The verse
only repeats the advice without adding anything to
it... .C.C.J.: Doesn’t strike us... .F.F. (East Melb.) :
Only ambleg round, the field of the obvious....
Peter S.: It all goes rather feebly and creaks at the
joints... .A.R.A.D.; The yarn leaves us very cold.
.... Ripponlea: In spite of the woobly-womble of
some of the lines, it is very vivid and effective:—
Th’ erimnals gibb’rings develop’d into a frenzied
demoniac roar.
But when he saw th’ gallows, signs of resignation
did lie exhibit,
As down th’ dark, dank, dismal, dirty, dilapidated
corridor
Did th’ mournful, gloomy cortege proceed to th’
gibbet.
He felt knocked out. And suddenly he feinted.
They gave him a little alcholic emulsion.
He had sever’d his mother’s throat from ear to ear
In a manner very repulsing.
He reluctantly arrived at th’ scaffold;
And shudder’d as he screwed through a crack
down th’ seissure.
He kissed his aged mother farewell.
And sobbingly his father’s paw did he pressure.
Slowly, painfully, he lifted up his heavy eyes.
With a desperate, trembling gesture he clutched his
throat.
When tears like cloud-bursts splashed down his face
Did they adjust t,h’ rope.
....Overlander: Not much of a yarn in very lumpy
verse... .Nob: The verse is pretty wild, but hasn t
much grip ; and there is no novelty about it. The
prose is mere weariness... .Vang: Doesn’t strike us
hard enough.... Aimee R,: Your raging and cooling
heart is too much like too many other hearts worn
bare in verse... .A.M.8.8.: All badly done and rather
in need of disinfectant P.O.MacC.: Verses that ask
a string of futile questions can be guaranteed as
rubbish Cecil G.: Highly dull moral advice in
bad verse... .H.C.G.: Doesn’t get to anything
M.B. (Forest Lodge): Far too thin F.W. (Auck-
land): Misses by a long way... .P. 8.8.: An old
idea which the verse is far too weak to carry
Noroc: “In order not to waste” our time you write
a long covering letter in which you ask a number
of unnecessary questions. We do not publish books,
but we are ready to give an opinion on matter in-
tended for publication in the paper. Our opinion of
what you send is a very poor one... -Buttenderry:
The usual sort of manufactured tale which neither
amuses nor convinces... .Ethel D.: “Silence” misses.
...•.Raymond F.: Wretched verse with no discover-
able point Stella B.: Nice verse, but not enough
there... .E.J.G.: States a weak commonplace in weak
verse Snowy S.: Nothing in your setting of it.
. ...1.5.Y.: Doesn’t make a yarn.... Gilbert O.:
“Pantomime” needed a finer touch.... Koala: Some-
where on the road, but still a long distance 0ff....
D.McL.; Repeats in unattractive fashion the old
thing that has been rhymed about so often....
Yvonne S.: Not our style... .H.H.H.: Peters is not
particularly convincing and his affairs are not worth
while... .C.C.M.; “Youth” misses... .Edd R.: Both
fall far short... .C.C. (Katoomba) : You call it a
“sonnet,” but that form, like every other, must
first of all keep in step.... Maud E.: The “Prayer”
is good, but tails off to a weak finish P.O.MacC.:
“But you turned thy head and whispered ‘nay’ ” is
a bad enough lingual mixture to be interesting.
.... A.L.J.: The insanitary yam is about as badly told
as any we have had for 24 hours... .D.F.J.: The
same old commonplaces in the same poor verse, but
with quite remarkable grammatical constructions
and magnificent variations of spelling Sunset: It
wanders on in a weary purposeless fashion with
nothing to say and no skill to say anything....
F.L.L.: Why try the difficult sonnet form when you
have only the haziest idea of how to write a line
of verse? Gumtip: The attempts to rhyme “de-
parture” with “future,” “adages” with “age” and
“success” with “rest” mark you as a dangerous man.
. ...Askarri; A weak little jest in hard verse....
Sidney A.: You tried to put the oldest, feeblest
remarks of the most commonplace person into six
lines of verse and made a horrible mess of every
line.
TO ARTISTTC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
1.8. C.: Your soliloquising lady is coming home....
C.L.: Not half good enough.... E.W.: No humor in
a mere statement of fact J.J.: Wonderfully
wooden. .. .H.W.T.: Cartoon not up... .A.T.: Sorry,
we don’t register either E.J.: Bald as tfie skull
of a Buddhist priest... .A.R.McK.: Criminal libel on
something or somebody... .A. 8.: Praiseworthy en-
deavor to get two people on to a threepenny-bit not
in our line... .E.C.: Looks like a foundation that
might be built on with perseverance and a lorry-
load of other virtues.

“Panchaz”: The modern innovation of
mail steamers with only two classes recalls
that the limit in these grades was reached by
the Messageries Maritime Co., which ceased
to carry passengers to these parts 11 years
ago. There were five distinct classes and an
occasional sixth-class on its boats: the deck
space was allotted accordingly. First-class
passengers had the run of the ship; second-
class passengers could go where they pleased
except on a small space specially reserved
for the first class. The second-class crowd
had their holy of holies, sacred to themselves
alone, excepting for the superior first class.
And so on, until you got down to the sixth
class, which enjoyed barely enough room to
sit down comfortably.
* * * *
“Weaver”: While all sorts of interests
have been represented in the Federal Parlia-
met, the important textile industry lias
found no one with first-hand knowledge to
say a word for it; hence some of the present
tariff anomalies. Britain produces no raw
silk, and the 10 per cent, preference means
therefore that users of silk yarn have to pay
about as much on their raw material as im-
porters pay on the finished piece goods. To
give silk weaving a chance yarns should be
free, and there should be a protective tariff
(not a revenue) on woven goods. At the
other end of textiles there is George A. Bond,
the hosiery man, making a bold bid to estab-
lish the cotton industry and without a penny
duty. This firm has recently asked for a
small bounty based on the weight of locally-
spun Australian cotton to be worked into
goods, and in the absence of tariff assistance
the claim deserves consideration.
# * * *
The tappers will be out, and the shiny
little cups will be ready to catch the drip
in. thousands of plantations, big and little, in
the islands to the north of Australia, with
rubber fetching 4s. a pound in London.
Dutch and native planters will rejoice as
much as British, and even in Papua, where
tapping has been abandoned for a long time,
the trees, probably all the better for the
rest, will be invited to get busy again. The
revival of the boom of 1910, however, is a
trifle premature, and if, as is cabled, new
companies are being rushed into being, much
good cash of thrifty widows will pour into
bottomless pockets. Since British estates
agreed voluntarily to restrict their output
in order to force up the price, the Dutch
estates and the little kebuns of thousands
of native landowners leaped into the breach,
with the result that, whereas the non-British
production before restriction was about a
quarter of the British, it is expected this
year to nearly equal it. When restriction
is removed, the new estates in the mean-
time coming into full bearing, a slump may
confidently be predicted and new ventures
established now under boom conditions will
doubtless take the count, as hundreds did
in the last depression.
* * * *
“Morob”: Years ago, when the German
New Guinea Company took over control of
the territory it was to administer, it found
an extraordinary assortment of currency in
use, not only marks and pfennigs, but Eng-
lish, French, American, Dutch, Japanese and
even Chinese coins. The company secured
the right to circulate its own coins, and a
large batch of these were minted in Germany
and sent out. On one side they were a
replica of the official coins, with the Kaiser’s
head and the ordinary lettering, and on the
other they bore a paradise-bird and their
value. In course of time they were called
in, and the regular German currency re-
placed them, but many remained in circula-
tion for years afterwards, and occasionally
one turns up even now. They are greatly
prized by collectors.
“Hamer”: The distance between Adelaide
and Sydney drops within the range of a day’s
journey with the start of a new aerial service
connecting, not only the southern city but
Broken Hill and Melbourne, by air-route
with the mail train at Cootamundra, N.S.W.
The passenger ’plane leaves Adelaide at 7.55
a.m.; at 11 Mildura is reached, and passen-
gers and mails are picked up from the ’plane
which left Broken Hill at 8.15. There is
half an hour for lunch at the place De Garis
helped to advertise, and mid-day sees the tra-
vellers at Hay, where a ’plane from Mel-
bourne (it starts at 7.45 a.m.) brings a
fresh cargo of passengers and mails. Then
the flight goes on to Narandera and Coota-
mundra (4.40 p.m.) ; and that night the pas-
sengers catch the 7.30 p.m. mail train which
reaches Sydney at 6.30 next morning. The
new service is a private-enterprise venture
by Australian Aerial Services, Ltd., but it
gets a Governmental blessing in the shape
of a subsidy.
* * * *
“Clerk”: The old yarn about the sick
laborer whose protest that he couldn’t work
because he was “shakin’ all over” was met
by the foreman with a direction to “go an’
give an ’and with the sieve,” had an echo in
a Melbourne court recently. The defend-
ant, a debtor, urged that he was not in a
normal state of health, as he suffered badly
from the “shakes,” his limbs being continu-
ally on the move. He admitted, however, in
cross-examination, that he was the champion
potato-digger of the Daylesford district, and
could dig 23 bags a day, adding that it was
his “shakes” that helped him get the dirt off
the tubers. Apparently physical infirmities
can be an aid to efficiency.
* * * *
“Chip Carter”: There is at least one up-
to-date spirit among Melbourne’s too numer-
ous street-musicians. The other night I
noticed that he had discarded the old accor-
dion that he played on his crowded pitch
and installed a cheap phonograph in its
place. Before I could distinguish the tune
above the noise of the traffic I found myself
wondering if he had done the job properly
and bought records of some of the popular
successes from the latest musical show. I
soon found he had done better than that.
His instrument was braying forth a selec-
tion of American national airs, and the way
the coppers were rattling into his hat at-
tested the excellence of his judgment.

....and when the lights come on, THERE is Signor Friscoe!
SIGNOR FRISCOE, famous xylophonist of the greatest
vaudeville circuit in the world, gives a striking demonstration
of The New Edison.
After his first selection he steps forward and says: "By special
permission of Mr. Thomas A. Edison, I shall play in direct
comparison with my Edison records on the New Edison
Phonograph. See if you can detect the slightest difference
between my own performance and Mr. Edison’s Re-Creation."
Signor Friscoe begins to play. No phonograph is visible.
Gradually the lights are dimmed, until nothing can be seen
but the glowing tip of his cigar. Suddenly a brilliant flash
of light almost blinds the audience. The music does not stop
for an instant. Then, gradually, the lights come on.
As they grow brighter and brighter, a living-room is seen,
with Signor Friscoe in a cosy easy chair. He is no longer
playing—instead he is enjoying the Edison Re-Creation of
his own playing! He steps down again to the xylophone
and plays a few bars—there is no difference!
Conclusive proof that the New Edison actually does bring the
artist to your own living-room in all save physical presence.

1). W. KEIR,
THE
90 SMITH STREET, COLLINGWOOD, VIC.,
OLD HIGHIiANDEK TOBACCO STOKE
“Cutter”: It occurred in Plymouth
(M.L.). “It has me beat,” admitted the
doctor, seating himself in our office-chair
and passing over a cable he had received
from Tahiti. “It is obviously not in French,
and the local interpreter swears it is nothing
like Maori. What infernal language do they
use over there?” he finished plaintively. We
took a long look at the puzzling telegram
and a brief one at the five-letter cable code- '
book, before reeling off the translation. The
fame of the office’s grip on foreign languages,
especially Tahitian, is still being broad-
cast by a grateful medico.
“B.”: Saw a narrow squeak one day
recently. A motor-car gave one of Clapp’s
passenger trains a great go to see who would
reach the bridge over the Wimmera first.
Passengers held their breath as the motorist
won by a few yards. lie held his just as
he passed the rails, for in turning round to
see how close the shave was, he ran into
the fence. The race cost him 30 quid.
“Caractacus”: When an old building goes
up in smoke there goes up with it (from
those who are not losers thereby) a sigh
of relief that another old death-trap has
been removed, and a pronouncement from the
nearest Fire-chief that this sort of building
will never be permitted again in our en-
lightened age. Melbourne, therefore, is
naturally disturbed that a post-war building,
a factory constructed under the newest
regulations for the preservation of life and
the ensuring of safety, should go off —as a
fireman put it —“like a packet of crackers.”
The Lincoln Mills at Coburg was declared a
model. It did not have automatic sprinklers,
but it had self-acting fire-alarms all over
the acres of buildings. These brought would-
be saviours quickly—but not quickly enough.
The disaster suggests that either our fire-
knowledge, our building regulations code or
our fire-inspection requires readjustment, if
not overhaul.
“C.J.L.”: I have known several would-be
suicides (B. 25/6/’25) whose bark was deaf-
ening and bite negligible. The two whose pre-
tensions tired me most were a Frenchman and
a Chinaman. The Frenchman tried hard for
years to convince his incredulous spouse that
he was not only capable of suicide but also
of wholesale murder. After every domestio
tiff he would spend hours in sharpening the
carving-knife; sometimes, for a change, he
would grab the two yelling children under
one arm, and, flourishing a shotgun in the
other, would make off into the bush. Whence
presently would come two shots in quick suc-
cession, followed a little later by a third.
But when dinner-time arrived the iron-hearted
woman would ring the bullock-bell as usual.
The Chinaman was less fortunate; his con-
stant threatening to jump off the table, with
one end of a rope round his neck and the
other fastened to a roof-beam, finished at
last when the table slipped from under him.
His white wife rushed in, and, grabbing
him by the legs, made a desperate attempt
to pull him down, at the same time scream-
ing, “Johnny, don’t hang yourself, don’t hang
yourself!” Nevertheless, with such assist-
ance as she was giving him, Johnny did.
“Tarago”: It was court-day at the local
Mechanics’ Institute, but as the only cases
to be dealt with were those of two persons
charged with failing to destroy vermin (rab-
bits, to wit), the P.M. had left the dis-
pensing of justice to our worthy J.P. When
the first case was heard, his Worship glanced
over his spectacles at the defendant. “You
are fined £2” —here he paused to pick up
the summons from the table and ascertain
the amount on the duty-stamp—“and ss.
costs,” he continued in measured tones. The
prosecuting lawyer was on his feet in a
moment, pointing out that his clients, the
local council, would be out of pocket by
every prosecution instituted if the costs
awarded were so inadequate. The Bench cut
him short by ordering the second case to be
called. It was on all fours with the pre-
vious one, but Authority contrived to see it
from a different angle. “You are fined 55.,”
he told the grinning defendant, and as the
purple-faced lawyer half-rose from his seat,
“with £2 costs,” he added drily.
“Tabac”: When a bolting motor-’bus
knocks a hole in the wall of your suburban
residence or city shop it will be dangerous
to assume that any lawyer will recover dam-
ages for you. Not long ago in England a
milk-oh’s pony bolted and smashed a shop
window. In the court plaintiff’s counsel
based his case on trespass, arguing that even
without any proof of negligence on the part
of defendant he was entitled to recover dam-
ages, the defendant being responsible for the
trespass of his cattle. But a decision of
Blackburn, C.J., in the River Wear Com-
missioners v. Adamson upset this contention.
Blackburn ruled that where property adjoin-
ing a spot on which the public has a right to
carry on traffic is injured by that traffic the
plaintiff must bear his own loss, unless he can
establish that some third party is in fault.
When people build beside a thoroughfare
they take that risk, and there is no differ-
ence between a shop, the railings or windows
of which may be broken by a carriage on
the road, and a pier, which is liable to be in-
jured by a ship. Mere ownership of the
carriage or ship which did the mischief does
not constitute a liability.
“Fana”: In a section of the Sydney
Botanical Gardens may be found a large
number of exotic medicinal plants. There
is one notable absentee from the collection,
however —the cocaine-shrub, Erythroloxon
coca, from the leaves of which the drug is
extracted. The explanation for its absence
is that in other public gardens its identity
has soon become known to addicts, with the
result that its ■ leaves have quickly vanished;
the leaves when chewed have exactly the
same effect as the pure drug.
“C.J.L.”: Most people have heard the
yarn of the leadswinger in khaki who
affected to mistake a soup-plate, held some
distance away, for a “thrippenny bit, sir?”
But I know an incongruity, a keen-eyed and
normal-sighted prospector, standing on the
top of Double Island Point lighthouse (Q.),
who genuinely mistook a huge school of por-
poises for a shoal of mullet. Nothing but the
glasses would convince him of his error. The
lighthouse is, I suppose, about a thousand
feet from the water, and, ridiculous as it
seems, I have a suspicion that the bushman
saw the porpoises in their true proportion.

World-Wide Godd Will
Good Will has been defined
as “the disposition of a pleased
customer to return to the
place where he has been well
treated.”
Good Will is also the dis-
position of a customer to
recommend a satisfactory
product to his neighbors and
friends.
It can be created by the
printed word only in so far
as that word reflects the
integrity of the institution
behind it.
Good Will is admittedly the
most valuable asset that any
business can possess. And
no organisation has so im-
pressive a reason to appreciate
the magnitude of its value as
Dodge Brothers, Inc.
This value—“this unprecedented
and world-wide Good Will
is founded on a few old-
fashioned principles of good
faith and good workmanship
which the world has come to
associate with Dodge Brothers
name.
Building ever better and better,
Dodge Brothers have simply
earned the trust and friendship
of the public by consistently
fulfilling public expectations.

Girls! Imagine your Complexion
Clear, Rosy and Velvety.
When your complexion worries you and you feel that your skin is unattractive, instead
of fresh and smooth, look to the soap you are using. Many soaps are more harmful to the
skin than actual neglect, for they contain alkali, which makes the skin harsh and dry.
Rexona Skin and Facial Soap is a specially prepared skin soap, free from alkali, and
contains just the right amount of the gentle, healing medication of Rexona, the Kapid
Healing Ointment, which
is so widelv used in the
treatment of skin and
scalp troubles.
Rexona Soap relieves the
clogged pores and tendency
to redness, cleans away the
blotches and oiliness, and
brings back that natural
beauty to the skin which is
the heritage of every girl.
Rexona Soap makes the
best, shampoo for the hair.
It cleanses the scalp from
dandruff, and leaves the
hair rich and glossy.

The Shadow.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
TWO straight-backed chairs of a quaint
design
In dark wood earven with beast and
bird
And a passion-flower on a coiling vine;
And when the south wind the curtain
stirred
We could see, hung over the earth on high,
Only a ruffle of cloud and sky.
The shredded lettuce is green as jade.
The oblong pawpaw is sulphur gold.
On a polished board is the silver laid,
With a damask rose in a napkin’s fold;
And a drink for the captious gods, divine,
Are the crystal bubbles on amber wine.
Yet the shadow comes and lurks between,
Touches your smile with a checking hand,
Drives back the laughters that might have
been
With a threat that I fear to understand.
We had planned so long for this splendid
hour
And the bud has died ere it bloomed a flower.
You spoke to me in the tones I know
And I tried to jest in the way we knew;
But I felt the force of that shadow grow
Till it blotted all of my heart from you,
As though yours mused upon far-off things.
And the slow hour drags that was made for
wings.
Oh, is it a lie of yesterday
That out of a hidden grave will rise?
1 only feel it. I cannot say
What bars the gate of our Paradise.
As with eager feet to its walls I press,
Mirth stays outside in the wilderness.
If I taxed your silence with questioning
word
You would answer mildly “A dream I
dreamed.”
You would strike with banter the dread that
stirred
Till through the scabbard the rapier
gleamed
Or, chafed by a secret knowledge, say
You never loved as you love to-day.
I can clasp you close in my yearning arms,
I can press your mouth till the warmth
must come.
I can ply each weapon of skilful charms,
But the shadow holds me aloof and dumb.
To help bare truth to a bold appeal
I could break your calm with reproach, I
feel.
But. reproach for what? For nothing done,
Only for something I think may be,
A cloud I fancy across our sun—
Ah, I can guess what your words would be,
Till for forgiveness I fain would plead,
Still knowing the lie is a lie indeed.
Can one thrust with a knife at a plume of
mist ?
Can one throttle a ghost with a naked
hand?
Can we taste “forsworn” on the lips we kist?
Do we look for ambush in open land?
Can we find a password to help us out
With a trust impaled on the sword of doubt?
Ah, if ’twas something the hand could grasp,
Something the eye could plainly see,
A door that gave to a lifted clasp
No matter how dark the room might be,
No matter how lonedfy, how accurst,
We would brave the threshold to know the
worst!
When the blow has fallen and hope has died
We can summon o*ur will to heal the scar,
We can build our tower of stubborn pride
With the stones of Things-as-They-Really-
Are;
But can we condemn where we prove no
blame,
Contest with shadow a shadow’s game?
* * . * *
“Melon?” “Thank you.” “A glass of wine?
Was ever a crimson rose more sweet!
How nice for our day to be so fine,
For seldom time and the loved one meet.”
Shall I turn, like a mad thing, shrieking
“Lies!”
To the feigned delight in your cloraded eyes?
No; I taste the salad and drink the brew _
And praise the melon. I thought this
meant
Milk of Heaven and honey-dew,
The crown to our long love’s sacrament.
And the shadow serves; but in devil’ls mood
He has turned the bread and the wine to
blood!
Blood of my life! Had you sinned a sin,
With the dread of a prison over you,
Had you come for my arms to shelter’ in
I had faced flung stones of the world for
you;
For the world and its hate could make no
scores
On a simple heart that was only yours.
But can we make feast with a lie between?
Can I hold your fingers and feiel the glove
On the palm where my naked palm has been?
< Can I take the pity and miss file love?
Can I seek cold ashes and think they glow?
Can joy sleep in a dead man’s: arms nor
know?
The silver gleams in the setting sun.
The ebon seeds of the pawpaw shine
In the cloven yellows and one by one,
The bubbles sink on the standing wine.
And we rise to part in the well-known way—
Only the shadow seems to stay.

Contrapuntal Discords.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
\\T ITH the goodwill of a town so
V j small that life would be imp os-
sible without a tolerance kindly
and sincere—so small that in it mi
could not live—the total abstainers of Qua rt-
I'°t and the Protestants of Quartpot l ad
asked Denny Deneen, J.P., pnublican, store-
keeper, butcher and Koman Catholic, to hike
the chair, as being the principal man of the
town, at the meeting to welcome Mr. Edl 'in
Penny, lay-preacher and temperance lecturer,
now on tour and playing one-night stands for
the collections thereof.
And Denny not only agreed to be chair-
man, but said that he would give the use
of Deneen’s social hall, and that the lecturer
should be given also the freedom of Quart-
pot for his overnight stay and be the guest
of the sinful hotel, also the possession of
Denny Deneen.
“You see,” said Denny, “ ’twill give me
great enjyment, then, to sit there an’ in-
throjuce the leksherman, an’ hear him sayin’
that dhrrink is a curse, an’ Shin Fein is
a crime. An’ ’tis good pol’tics to have the
leksherman stayin’ at me pub an’ aytin’ his
eggs an’ bacon wit’in a slitone’s t’row of the
cursed dhrrink before mintioned. Come you,
Aloysius McShane,” he said to the highly-
accomplished Clerk of Petty Sessions, “an’
see the new lights I have put in me shocial
hall. Ashettylene-gas, it is, an’ the shpent
carbide shmells like the sheven devilles of
Ulsther.”
“Where did you get the scenery?” asked
McShane, looking at the one set on the little
stage—a backcloth of an exterior allegedly
Italian, and proscenium wings of red paint
festooned with white paint and looped with
yellow paint, purporting to be silk curtains
confined in chains of gold.
“A thravelling arthist did them here, then.”
“He must have travelled fast while he was
painting it. What’s that thing in the centre?
The funeral of a steamer under forced
draught or a pig-iron furnace?”
“That’s Vcshuvius volcano, then. ’Tis a
good volcano, isn’t it?”
“It’s very active,” admitted McShane.
“And the fireworks stand for lava, eh? And
the pigeon-holes down by the dam?”
“It isn’t a dam, then. That’s the Bay
of Naples, and what you call pigeon-holes
is houses on the lieigliths. ’The thravellin’
arthist told me himself, then.”
“It’s a very good volcano,” said McShane,
hastily mollifying Deneen; but, honesty com-
pelled him to add: “I don’t think I’ve seen
anything like it before.”
“Thrnc, you haven’t,” replied Denny, quite
satisfied again. “The thravellin’ arthist told
me that none o’ them big t’e’tres in Sydney
will show you schenery like that. There’s
on’y wan shtupid thing I did here, buyin’
them fire-extinguishers.”
“The grenades on the walls?”
“That’s it, then. A thraveller come here
soilin’ them t’ings, an’ he’d have talked me
out of me boots if I hadn’t bought ’em. You
wouldn’t get a fire here wanst: in the Long
Oppression of Ireland. We've not had any
fire here in years. Quartpot Creek’s too pros-
perous to have fires. The only inshurance we
want here is inshurance ag’in sin—ag'in being
found out, I mean. But them things is just
waste.”
“Grenades don’t cat anything, and you
never know.”
“Maybe, maybe! Anyway, Deneen’s
shocial hall is ready for business and the
eloquence of Misther Penny, lay-preacher
and inimy of the currsed dhrink.”
* * * *
Mr. Penny, enemy of the cursed drink, had
no conscientious objections to being the
guest of Denny Deneen’s vehicle of traffic.
Introduced to the coffee-room, he proved him-
self a trencherman of great energy and
utterly fearless in the presence of appa-
rently overwhelming quantities of food.
After lunch he prepared his notes for the
lecture, and noted that harmony was pro-
vided in a piano solo by the baker’s daughter
and a duet from “Mascotte,” to be said or
sung by Mr. and Mrs. Puttifoot, the per-
formance being the first exposition of Putti-
foot’s culture by marriage.
And at night that important public man,
Uncle, the bellman, was heard lifting up his
voice to tell all men that things would
happen. “Ter-night, ter-night! The great
lecksherer, Mister Nedwin Penny! Ter-
night, ter-night! ’Armony by local talent.
Mr. Deneen, J.P., in the chair. Ter-night,
ter-night! Pop’lar prices—two an’ one. Ter-
night, ter-night!”
The hall, three-parts full, brilliant under
the new acetylene light; the canvas curtain
advertising the local baker, the local carpen-
ter and undertaker; and Denny Deneen,
butcher, publican, storekeeper and carrier;
also the local chemist, asserting in blue paint
on a red ground that the local hair-restorer
and liver-regulator were the finest produced
in the world —or in Quartpot itself, for that
matter. And then on the stroke of eight the
baker’s daughter struck the piano violently
with “Silvery Waves” as overture; and at
the end of it up went the curtain and showed
that historic group upon the stage—Mr.
Penny to the right of the chairman, sup-
porters of cold water in their proper semi-
circle behind the chair, and the chairman,
Denny Deneen, J.P., waiting there as calmly
and confidently as Caruso, Melba, Tetrazzini
and Galli-Curci, ready to sing nursery
rhymes before all thle crowned faces of
Europe.
More importantly than these of Europe,
the crowned faces of Quartpot were there in
the front row: the Sergeant and liis wife,
Aloysius McShane and Denny Deneen’s
niece from the Summit—her name was
Tannie Morell. Jimmy Cleghorn, who sat
near her with his sister, saw little of the
>stage because he couldn’t keep his eyes off
the aforesaid niece, who, so far from having
any time for him, divided her attention be-
tween Milly Cleghorn and McShane. Be-
hind them were a dozen rows of less im-
portant townspeople, and farmers and tin-
dredge men who had come from the bush, and
must drive home before the moonset; and
well at the back of the hall were the self-
conscious Mickey, the unretiring Uncle, the
bellman, and the bashful Bad Man of Goon-
diwindi.
Denny Deneen arose, and the fears of the
lecturer of the temperance party that he
would take charge of the meeting and pro-
vide lecture and harmony all by himself at
first seemed to be justified. For Denny,
alleging that his duty was to keep order and
introduce the lecturer, seemed determined to
keep time too —to keep all the time, in fact.
“I am inthrojuicin’ Mr. Edwin Penny to
your kind attintion,” said Denny Deneen.
“He have great success as a .leksherer on
the cursed dhrrink, an’ he will tell you of
the great disinjyableness good beer will make
in your shtomach. He will alsho exshplain,
or attimpt to exshplain, about the terr’ble

Have you suspected
your Kidneys?
Are you dragging along day in and day out with a dull,
throbbing backache?
Do you feel lame in the morning, tired all day; suffer sharp,
torturing twinges at every sudden move? Then there’s something
wrong!
You may never have suspected your kidneys, yet often it s
the kidneys that are at fault. A cold, strain, or overwork congests
the kidneys and slows them up; poisons accumulate in the system,
and many mysterious aches and pains result.
You may have headaches and dizzy spells, too, with perhaps
some annoying bladder irregularity. Don’t wait for more serious
trouble. Use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They have helped
many Sydney folks. They should help you.
SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
Mr. A. B. Cowell, who lives at the corner of Park Road
and Hardy Street, Mascot, Sydney, says:—"Some months ago I
was suddenly seized with a terrible pain across my back, just
above the kidneys. It did not go away, as I thought at first it
would, but, on the contrary, it got worse, and I was soon so bad
that I was bent almost double. I was completely crippled and
even at night I got very little rest from the constant pain. I
could not turn over without suffering acutely, in fact, no
position was comfortable for long. My secretions were affected,
be'ing thick and cloudy, with a red sediment. I tried different
remedies, but they gave me no relief whatever. One day a
friend suggested I should take Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills,
and it proved to be good advice, too, for three bottles cured me
completely. I feel, splendid now, and my recovery is due solely
to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”
Four years later Mrs. Cowell says:—“My son is still well,
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills having completely banished all
signs of kidney trouble.”
DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS are sold by all chemists and stores
at 2/9 per bottle, or from Foster-McClellan Co.,
15 Hamilton Street, Sydney.

IRRITATION OF THE SKIN USE
DOAN’S OINTMENT.
SYDNEY PEOPLE TESTIFY.
A WOMAN’S WORD.
Mrs. W. Membrey, Como, 79 Sim-
mons Street, Enmore, says:—“For
three years I was a martyr to Piles,
and I don’t think any ailment causes
more suffering and loss of sleep. I
used Pile remedies, and was treated
by a doctor, but nothing gave me any
relief. After so many failures I
thought there was no cure for this dis-
tressing complaint, but I was mis-
taken, as a treatment with Doan’s
Ointment proved. A short course of
this wonderful preparation cured me,
and I advise sufferers to give it a
trial.”
Eleven years later Mrs. Membrey
says:—“Doan’s Ointment cured me of
Piles over eleven years ago, and I
have been free of the complaint ever
since.”
A MAN’S WORD.
Mr. A. H. Francis, 192 Union Street,
Erskineville, Sydney, says :—“I used
Doan’s Ointment for Itching and Pro-
truding Piles, and I am pleased to tell
you it completely cured me. Previously
I had tried all kinds of Ointments, but
they gave me little or no relief. I was
suffering terribly when I first applied
Doan’s Ointment, and had little hone
of it doing me any good, but its sootii-
ing and healing effect was noticeable
almost at once, and by the time I had
used one pot I was completely cured,
all signs of Piles having disappeared
entirely. I am a great believer in
Doan’s Ointment, and consider it the
best Pile remedy known.”
Twelve months later, Mr. Francis
says—“l have not been troubled with
Piles since Doan’s Ointment cured me.”

crime of Noah, w T ho was the firsht sailorman
to relaxsh himself after a long and per’lous
v’yage. ’Tis from the thr’dition’l fact of
Noah, after beachin’ the ark, prosheedin’ to
the little public-house near the wharf that
sailors to this day have a pint or two at the
Jack’s Come Home Hotel. Mishter Penny
will tell you also of Sliolomon dhrinking his
wine with the Kune of Sheba—an’ good com-
p’ny it was. I want you to give the vislntor
a patient and attintive bearin’. The world
goes round because of the many minds and
opinions in it pullin’ at each other, and
helpin’ the worrld to shpin. Anny man is
welcome to slitate his case, and. I am here
as imparshial umpire. Orangemin can come
here an’ I will lishten to thim shpeakin’
their moind. It should be enough for us
min of the tlirue religion to know that the
others will shuffer after death ; so let them
talk now all they want. We know .that we
have the tlirue religion, an’ that judgm’nt
will come to them for their mishtake; an’
we can leave rethribution to that time.. Let
anny man say what he like—as long’s he
don’t say a wurrd ag’in’ Father Quilty. He
can say what he like of Rome, because Rome
is too big to get hurted; but not a word ag’in
Father Quilty; an’ hands off Father Shana-
han an’ liis Holiness the Pope. I will now
call upon Mr. and Mrs. Puttifoot — knee
Chookwanday,” added Denny, slyly, “to sing
the duet from ‘Mashcotte’ —-‘Glow, Glow.’ ”
“Glew-Glew,” corrected Mrs. Puttifoot,
nee Choquindie, in a stage-whisper, which
tradition makes louder than the speeches in-
tended for direct hearing.
“ ‘Glow Glow’ or ‘Glow Glow,’ ” replied
Denny, annoyed at public correction —“ ’tis
all wan. But maybe you’re right—maybe.
‘Mashcotte’ is a sliuburb of Sliydney near
Bot’ny, an’ there’s glue fact’rics there. So
‘Glue Glue’ it would be.”
And then followed the local Bettina and
Pippo, and the stupidity of. the translation
into English caused that audience of country
hardheads to smile, only nearness to the
miserable offenders who struggled with tin;
foolishness restraining them from loud
laughter. No such considerations affected the
giggles of Mickey or the loudly whispered
objections of the Bad Man from Goondiwindi.
“When in your eyes I look, I feel,” sang
the unhappy Pippo, gasping his stage-fright
and wishing lie had not weakly consented to
be cultured.
“A sweet, a wild, a sad sensation,” replied
Bettina, nervous, but glad to be in the
public eye.
Pippo: “You’ve but to glance my heart to
steal!”
Bettina: “And oh! the wild fierce palpita-
tion !
I love you dearly and blush—
I start, and feel that I am sink-
ing.”
Pippo: “I make up my mind for a rush,
I cannot tell wliat I am thinking.”
The Bad Man : “Well, spare me flamin’
days!”
Mickey : “He-he-he ! Mad as snakes. lle-
lie-he!”
Bettina: “Turkeys ! Whisper softly now.”
The Bad Man: “Turkeys wliisp’r’n’—
’struth!”
Pippo : “Music of my sheep—Ba-a-a!”
Mickey: “Music of bees sheep ! Bill Putti-
foot cuts sheep’s throats !”
The Bad Man: “He’s off, liees onion!”
Bettina: “Lo’ thy gentle voice—Glo-oo!
Glo-oo! Glo-oo!”
Mickey: “She’s dippy, too!”
Pippo: “Music of my sheep—Ba-a-a-a.”
Bettina: “Glue! Glue! Glue!”
Pippo: "Ba-a-a.”
Bettina: “Glue! Glue! Glue!”
Pippo: “Ba-a-a.”
The Bad Man: “They’re dilly !”
Bettina: “Glue! Glue! Glue!”
Pippo: “Ba-a-a-a-a-a-ali!”
“By cripes, I’ve had enough,” said Pippo
Puttifoot to Bettina, his wife. “I told y’
I’d make a goat of meself.”
“’Tis the firsht time I heard turkeys whis-
perin’, an’ sheep goin’ to conshervatorums to
learn their scliales, then,” said Denny.
“Music of me sheep, Ba-a-a-a-ah! If I
wasn’t sure I heard it I’d sign the pledge,”
said the Bad Man, suddenly become brave
on hearing human beings talking in the
vulgar tongue.
And then laughter wouldn’t be denied, and
the duet was declared off on a production of
50 per cent, of it; and Mr. Penny knew
that the meeting was out of hand, and con-
gratulated himself that no mere collection
would be his, but good gate-money clear of
expenses and every shilling net. Yet, despite
the sporadic bursts of laughter and the con-
tinuous ripple of giggling, the joy of the
artist returned to Mr. Penny when he heard
that finest of all human sounds —the sound
of the voice of one’s self advising the common
herd.
. “My deah friends,” said he, realising a
08 per cent, extraction of his pulpit manner.
“Aftah listening to that beautiful duet of
rural love, we must all feel bettah. I am
proudah of the heartay welcome than of
anything that has happened to me in my long
careeah of advocate of total abstinence.
Quah chairman, Mr. Deneen, has shown
us true Christian tolerance in taking the
chayah here to-night. While recognising his
kindly virtues I do not in the slaightest
altali my opinion that I cannot admiah the
hqwah trade, nor my opinion that the name
of these houses for the vending of fermented
and spirituse liqwahs should be not ho-tels,
but hot-ells.”
, He paused for. the laugh, and the semi-
circle on the stage tittered encouragingly;
but the people before him were dumb as in
the presence of a calamity.
“By cripes, he’s a dull bloke,” said the Bad
Man from Goondiwindi, and the dull bloke
heard him and proceeded, but obviously dis-
couraged.
“Hot-ells, my friends, not hotels. I shall
by means of diagrams now show you the
effect of alcohol on the human system. It
is estimated by leading statisticians that, if
the total amount”
“Gord ’elp us!” said the Bad Man. “He’s
worse than a ’larm of fire!”
“Them things on the walls is for puttin’
out fires,” said Uncle. “Y’ bust ’em open
an’ out goes the fire in a jiffy.”
The Bad Man casting doubt on Uncle’s
knowledge of the subject, Uncle proceeded at
great length to tell all of the things he had
known in London, before his education was
interrupted by emigration to the ignorant
“colonies”; and the Bad Man being argumen-
tative, the debate was long, if quiet.
Meantime Mr. Penny floundered in statis-
tics and escaped from the quagmire cf figures
to the more solid ground of mere hearsay.
He talked interminably; the audience rest-
ive, and the men who had to drive to their
farms in the bush before moonset openly
anxious. Watches were consulted and anxious
glances given at the western windows and
the early moon about to founder behind the
great granite mountain. At last a man
■with very new and squeaky boots arose and
walked down the long hall to the front door
as Mr. Penny reached the place for that old
oratorical trick of asking a question in hope,
and answering it in scorn.
“And if such men come to you, what do
you say?”
“Squeak! Squeak!” replied the boots go-
ing to the door, so that their owner might re-
port the actual station of the moon.
“Do you say ‘this’ to them, or ‘that’?
What can you say?”
“Squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak!” replied
the boots, as their owner returned with the
information to the Sergeant, and he immedi-
ately showed distress-signals to Denny
Deneen, who had been restless of his own dis-
comfort and now had a right to be impatient
in the public interest. With painful effort
to be polite, he held himself in check, hoping
against hope that Mr. Penny’s eyes should be
opened so that he might make an end.
“I will tell you what you should say. We
will have none of the accursed stuff that in
all ages has taken more lives than pestilence
or war. In all these things its effect is seen.
Throughout history and the Bible we see its
efforts for death; we are told that the pro-
phet Jonah was punished for disobeying the
law. What law was it, my friends, that he
broke? Seeing that he was in the wicked
city of Ninavee, it is highly probable—nay,
certain—that his crime was the crime of
Noah —the terrible wickedness of intoxica-
tion.”
“You come over ’ere,” said Uncle to the
Bad Man, “an’ I’ll'show yer how this extin-
guisher thing works.”
"Righto,” said the Bad Man, who had by
will and in the excitement of the debate
utterly forgotten the lecture and Mr. Penny.
Denny plucked Mr. Penny by the coat-
tails. " ’Scuse me,” whispered Denny, “the
bush people have a long way to dhrive.”
“The wickedness of intoxication,” repeated
Mr. Penny, sternly regarding his interrupter,
whom he Had not plainly heard. “And the
Lord punished him. How? The Lord incar-
cerated Jonah —immured him in a fish.”
“Y’ just lift it off the ’ook,” said Uncle,
delicately handling the fire-extinguisher, “an’
hit it on the floor to knock that button thing
in, and the extinguisher thing puts out tire
lire.”
"In wliat kind of fish was it, my friends,
that Jonah was imprisoned?”
“Oh, tell ’em right out,” said Deneen, more
loudly. “These good people dhrive a long
way, an’ they must dhrive out before the
moon’s gone; an’ bad roads.”
“What fish was it?” demanded Mr. Penny,
as if he had not heard. “Was it a shark?
No! Was it a- schnapper? No! Was it a
•flathead? No, my friends, it was not.”
“Show us how it works, Uncle,” said the
Bad Man.
“Wliat fish then was it, my deah friends?
Was it a barracoota? No. Then what fish
was it?”
“ ’Twas a dam’ whale,” shouted Denny.
“An’ ’tis only hearsay, anyway.”
“Hit it on the floor like that,” said Uncle,
lifting the fire extinguisher and hitting it
“like that” on the floor; and then the lec-
ture ended.
Uncle, holding to that mad cylinder he
could not control, the mingling of its chemi-
cals giving it kicking energy, was grabbed
by the Bad Man as soon as he saw the danger
of the escaping fumes and dragged to the
front door, the Bad Man kicking the extin-
guisher into the corner as he made his exit.
In the first alarm of Uncle’s roaring as he
wrestled with the plunging cylinder, the
men of the audience took charge and stam-
peded their womenfolk through the side doors,
and then the people on the stage escaped by
the back door, and Denny, seeing that the
spent cylinder was safe, sought the street.
Laughing, and still laughing when he found
the author of the mischief, he took Uncle by
the collar, and Uncle trembled in anticipation
of his beating.
“A good deed, bellman, you did, this night.
“I’ll pay the damage,” said the Bad Man,
not yet believing in this recognition of ser-
vice. “I asked him to show me.”
“There’s no damage, Goondiwindi. Uncle
here put out that leksherer’s fire. Come you
in, Uncle, and have a dlirink; an’ you, too,
Puttifoot. Let your wife shtay wit’ Mis-
thress Deneen while we have the currsed rum
that put Jonah on the shprcc.”
It was after the second drink that the
Bad Man opened his heart to Puttifoot.
“Your missus was lookin’ bonzer,” said
the Bad Man, easing with flattery the criti-
cism that was to come. “But, by cripes,
that song must ha’ been composed in a
’sylum. I been among turkeys lots o’ times
an’ never heard ’em talk like that.”
Puttifoot begged that the error be for-
gotten and paid for another drink —the third
drink; and it made the Bad Man more
candid.
“By cripes!” said the Bad Man. “You call
y’self a butcher, an’ singin’ about ‘music of
me sheep, ba-a!’ Yer can’t ever have kept
sheep long before y’ killed ’em! ‘Music of
me sheep, bah!’ I’d like ter see you shep-
herdin’ for three months. Music, by cripes!
Sheep’d drive a inan dilly.”
“Good-night, Mr. Deneen,” said Puttifoot
with the dignity of a great man insulted by
an inferior.
“Good-night, Bill me lad. Go you home
wit’ ‘Glue Glue.’”
“Arrrrrh!” said Puttifoot very disgusted—
“good-night, all.”
“So long, Pippo.”
“Go an’ get work,” replied Puttifoot with-
out relevance, and left them.
“Music of me sheep, B-a-a-a-ah!” sang the
Bad Man in derision.
“Glue! Glue! Glue!—sing up, Uncle.”
“Ba-a-a!”
“Glue ! Glue! Glue!”
“Ba-a-a!” , *
In his bedroom Mr. Penny counted his
blessings, the gate-money of the laborer in
the vineyard in opposition to the laborers
in the brewery; and his blessings were
shekels of silver.
