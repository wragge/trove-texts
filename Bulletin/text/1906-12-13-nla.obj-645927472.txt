[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
O THE keen wind blows through our slop-
chest clothes
As we tramp round the fo’c’sle head
To the droning call of “Heave and
Pawl”!
For our chantey-man “ feels dead,”
Till the mate, hal'd by, gives a warning cry,
“Now sing an’ show willin’, you swine !”
Then a chantey wail is borne 011 the gale,
And we sing in a husky whine :
Sometimes we’re hound for Liverpool,
Sometimes we're hound for France,
Heave away, my bullies ! Heave away-ay !
Bat notv we’re bound for Sydney town
To yive those girls a chance
Heave away, my bully boys, we're all bound. to go!
And the mate laughs loud : “ You’re a hell-fire
crowd
For the Sydney girls to meet! ”
But we close our ears to his biting sneers
As we sway on our aching feet.
And memories rise as the bad grog dies
Of the things we had planned to do,
When, our last voyage o’er, we had stepped
ashore.
With the swagger of a paid-off crew.
Now it’s shake her up, my bully boys.
We’re bound to rise and shine.
Heave away, my bullies ! Heave away-ay /
We’re signed aboard a packet ship,
She’s one of the Black Ball line,
And away, my bully boys, we’re all bound to go !
Oh, we’re gone at the knees, with our caps full of
bees
When we’ve hove the anchor short,
And we’re praying for a show just to sneak away
/ below
To the bottle that we brought from port.
But the mate stands by with a watchful eye
(He’s a hound from his big feet up),
And we can’t get a sip to “ freshen up the nip,”
Tho’ we’ve heads like a poisoned pup.
So its xohisky is the life of man —
Whisky ! —Johnny !
O, give me whisky in % an old tin can;
Whisky for my Johnny !
When the tug swings clear with a parting cheer,
And the “ old man ” sets the course,
The “ shanghaied ” men from the crimper’s den
Start work on the old “ dead horse.”
And it’s little they ken of the two-pounds-ten
That the boarding-master got
For a donkey’s bed and an aching head,
A knife, and an old quart pot.
They say, old man, your mule is dead,
And they say so, and they hope sol
They say he died, and you pawned h is hide,
0, poot — old — man!
We are setting sail to a freshening gale
Till the sinking sun dips low ;
Then as daylight wanes we answer our names,
And the mate’s watch goes below.
There’s a rush for the kid where the prize is hid,
Then a wail like a fiend gone daft
For the mate’s sneaked in, and the son of sin
Has taken our whisky aft !
O, it’s whisky cold and whisky hot,
Whisky !—Johnny !
O, whisky cheers the sailor's lot,
Wh isky for my Johnny /

CRIPPS CL AER.
The Babbler.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AFTER the train started, I found that
there were only two of us in the carriage.
I was returning to the city, after an
absence of twelve years, hoping that my pious
old Dad would produce the historical fatted calf.
My companion was George Harris, better
known as “ The Babbler,” a noted shearer’s cook,
under whom I had suffered at several sheds in
the W.est., Bush born and-bred, he was on his
first trip to the coast, and, to use his own con-
fident expression, he was “ clobbered-up pro-
perly.” A brand-new suit of city-made clothes,
for which he had been measured by post, so to
speak, bright yellow boots with very pointed
toes, a brilliant magenta neckerchief, a rolled-gold
watch-chain, and, crowning glory, a high cabbage-
tree hat. The whole turn-out fairly howled,
“I’m HIM!”
“It’s easy to see that you have done well this
season, George,” I said.
. “ Well! ”,he said. “Well ain’t the word fer it.
Over three hundred quid. Nineteen sheds sence
the beginnin’ of the year,' averagin’ six weeks
apiece ” (the arithmetic is George’s, remember).
“ Four in Queensland, six in New South Wales,
an’ the rest in New England ; besides a lot I
couldn’t take on. I got a few quid from the
other babblers at a dozen other sheds, fer not
standin’. They knoo they ’adn’t a ’ope if I stood.
I’m goin’ down to show these city jokers a
few tvrinkles in the cookin’ line. I ’ear that
cooks can make big money at the fust-class pubs,
in Sydney, an I’m goin’ ter ’ave a cut in. I’ll
tickle the beggars up. What do yer think o’ me
clobber? Great, ain’t it? Self-measured, too.
An awker at Narrooreen recommended a place
in Sydney, an I wrote an’ got a self-measurin’
card. Barrin’ a little ’elp from Ginger Ryan, fer
parts I couldn’t get at, 1 did it on me own. Bit
eight under the wings, but it’ll stretch with
wear. Six quid. Highest-priced cloth in the
shop. Oh, 1 got me boots in Bourke. Bit small,
but they’re just the shiny. Look at that for a ’at.
Ain t she a bosker ? The bloke on’y charged me
cost price, with carriage added. Two quid, an’
cheap as dirt. are yer goin’ ter stop in
Sydney? Ome, are yer ? So’in I. Leastways, I
think it’ll be like ’ome, A chap in the pub. at
Bourke told me of a good place where
they’re a good crowd o’ chaps, an’ I’m gom’
there. ’E’s telegrafted that I’m cornin’, an’ they’re
ter meet me at the railway station. I’m only
wonderin’ ’ow they’ll know me in the crowd.
There’s a two-up school close to the place, I ’ear ;
so if I can’t get cookin’ at the pubs., I can make
exes, there, I’m lull of the bush. A man like
me’s lost there.”
“Aren’t you afraid of being taken down?” I
asked.
“Taken down?” ho said, in unutterable scorn.
“Me taken down by a wishy-washy crowd like
that? They ain’t got a ’ope. The other way
about, more like.”
When we reached the terminus, half-a-dozen
people rushed to meet him, with a warmth of wel-
come that should have brought tears to my eyes.
Uncle was there, and Ma, and Cissy, and the
Others—as leery-looking a party as ever faced the
Bench after Cup day. Nobody was there to meet
me, and George was sorry. He said : “Come
’ome with us, ol’ feller. Yer can see wot they
are. Rpal toffs. ’Ow are yer off fer beans ?” he
whispered ; “I’ve got plenty, yer know, an’ yer
welcome.” I thanked him and declined, for I
was pretty flush myself, but, thinking to do him
a good turn, I gave him a hurried opinion as to
the looks of Ma and the rest of them. The warn-
ing was hotly resented, and quite wasted.
I then went away to find, in my case, that veal
was “ off.” Dad and the rest were cold. There
is nothing in that tale after all.
Six days of'hunting for old friends, and chill
disappointment when I bad found them, satisfied
me that I would be happier in the bush ; so I
made up my mind to leave. Late in the after-
noon of my last day’s stay in the city, I was pass-
ing the General Post Office, when I felt a timid
touch on the elbow. I turned around sharply,
andt had great difficulty in recognising—George.
All his one-time glory had departed. The
cabbage-tree was gone, and in its place was an
old battered “hard-hitter.” The self-measured
“ clobber ” was stained and creased. The sleeves
of the coat were burst at the seams under the
armpits. The boots, still retaining patches of
their pristine yellow, were slashed in several
places, as the bagman cuts his boots for ease.
And his pants !! And his battle-marked face !!!
There stood before me six feet and a bit of un-
mitigated calamity. And yet a strong man
showed through it all. , '
“ Hello, George !” I said, “ where did you get
that hat?”
“ Fer Gawd’s sake, Jack, don’t chyack me now.
I’m a total wreck. Ain’t got a bean, an’.’aven’t
’ad a feed to-day. Bin waitin’ ’ere ’.opin’ ter sight
yer before yer got outer ’ell. I needn’t ask ”
“No, you needn’t, old chap; come along.” I
took him to a quiet place where he fed, and then
we went to where there is good liquor. Then he
told me.... “ Yes, Jack, they cut me up proper,
an’ I’m a chump. One satisfaction, I’ve left me
mark there; an’ I’d ’a’ beat the ’ole crowd if I
’adn’t been woodened at the end o’ the scrap.”
“ Tell me all about it,” I said.
“Yer wont tell the chaps? Well, then, I’ll
tfeU yer. After you cleared that night we went
’ome in a cab—leastways, Uncle an’ Ma, and me
an’ Cissy did—an’ w’bn we got ’ome ive ’ad a great
feed. Sossiges, an’ ’am an’ eggs, an’ a lot of other
things we don’t offen see in the bush. The Others
came in after, an’ we ’ad a great ol’ sing-song, an’
it wasn’t too bad. No liquor, not a drop. [Straight
wire. They gammoned strict teetotal. Next day
I shoved my draft inter the bank, an’ left it there,
all but a few quid, thinkin’ it would be safe.
They gev me a cheque book, an’ I felt like Jimmy
Tyson. Cissy was with me, an’ told me I was a
chump ter leave it in a place like that, where
they were like as not to shut up any niinnit. I
wasn’t goin’ ter carry a. couple o’ centuries about
with me, so 1 chanced it. I gev Cissy a score o’
quid ter buy some fal-lals, an’ she was goin’ ter
marry me next week. Later on in the day I got
inter the two-up school, an’ ’ad a job ter get there,
they was so partic’ler. They wouldn’t let the
Others in at 9,1 1. Eh ? Oh, yes, I lost fifty. It
was me own fault. Yer see, I was backin’ ’eads,
an’ w’en I had dropped about a score, I turned
round an’ backed tails. Yer never seen such bad
luck. The ’eads backers couldn’t go wrong after I
stopped backin’ ’em. I got a bit wild, an’ per-
formed a bit, an’ as we offen do at the sheds, I
collared the pennies off the kip an’ chucked
them inter the, crowd. The boss o’ the place
didn’t like it, an’ e said : ‘None o’ those
Mulga tricks ’ere, me noble fly mug,’ an’
sooled two professional pugs on ter me, an’
I was passed out. The Others ’appened ter
be passin’ w’en I was chucked out, an’ they told
me that the place was dead crook, an’ they took
me to a place where—Cissy told me after—l
hadn’t Buckley’s. I dropped nearly fifty there
before I took a tumble. Then the Others tried to
take me down at those old games sich as the
matchbox, etcettery. I was too fly for that sort
o’ thing, so I left them. W’en .1 got ’ome, Ma
an’ Uncle was out, an’ Cissy was on ’er lonesome.
I told ’er that I ’ad lost near a centur3 T . bhe did
go crook, an’ cried fit ter burst at strangers get tin
so much good money. In the end, we made it up,
an I gev 'er a cheque fer the lot to keep until we
was married —next week. 31a an’ Uncle didn t
come ’ome till late that night, an’ the Others
brought in lots of liquor, an’ we made a night of
it. Towards mornin’ I was chucked out fer
thumpin’ one o’ the Others fer goin' through me
w’en ’e thought I was asleep. I lost me lovely
cady then, so I must ’a’ bin pretty full. I didn t
wake till near midday, an’ then found myself in a
big paddock. The Lord on’y knows ow I got
, there. I don’t. I thought things over, an went
inter town, an’ sighted the joker in the bank.
’E told me that I only ’ad a quid left. I drew
that, an’ went ’ome to see Cissy to get some of the
stuff she’d drawn. She was dead cold, an’ said
that she ’ad gev me back my cheque after
I ’ad be’aved so shamefully the night
before. She wouldn’t ave no more truck
with me, an’ Uncle an’ Ma said the same. Then
the Others came in, an’ I got wild, an’ nearly
busted the ’ole show. I marked the Others
proper, an’ would ’a’ whacked the lot of ’em, on’y
Cissy—my Cissy, that was to ’ave married me
next week—she woodened me with a china vawse.
That broke me up, an’ when I got right I cleared.
Police ? Not me. If I can’t get me rights on pie
own, I don’t want no traps. So I waited an’
waited, ’opin’ ter see you, an’ did a perish fer
three days on ’arf-a-jini. Yes, you’re right, I’m
a chump with cheques all right. It looks some-
how as if it wasn’t money you part with, but on’y
a bit o’ paper, an’ the stuff goes like water. I’m
goin’ ter sock it next time.”
“ Have you tried the hotels yet for a job?” I
asked.
“Oh, them,” be said, reflectively! “Yes; I
tackled the biggest of them the fust day. They
ain’t no good ter me. I waltzed into a big office,
an’ saw a bald-headed geeser (f-eems ter me that
all the blokes ’ere’s got no thatch). He was
siftin’, smokin’ stationerv —cigrctts, yer know—an’
’e swings round in the chair, an’ ses hawty-like,
‘Well, my man, wot’s ver lay?’ I told im I
wasn’t ’is man, but was George ’Arris, an’ a fust-
class babbler at that. ‘Babbler!’ ’e ses, sur-
prised like. ‘ Wot’s a babbler ?’ ”
“‘Why, babblin’ brook is po’try for rattlin’
good cook in the Bush, an’ they drops the brook
an’ calls us babblers fer short,’ 1 ses.
“’E laughed out loud, an’ ses, ‘ Very proper.
An’ ydu’re a babbler ? ’
“ ‘Yes,’ I ses, ‘an’ oneo’ the best.’
“’E looks me up an’ down, an’ ses, ‘Can yer
really cook ?’
“ An’ then I fair paralysed ’im. 1 told 'im agan
who I was, an’ that I ’ad cooked before ’e was
born. I named about fifty shells I ’ad cooked fer.
I could make about six different kinds q’ bread,
not countin’ four Sorts o’ soda bread. Bloomonge,
etcettery, was on’y triflin’ things ter me, an’ a
sauce Which is me own patent, an’ me bread an’
pastry’s that light I alius ’ave ter shut the galley
door when I take it out o’ the oven, fer feat it
flies away with the draught. An’ I told ’iin, too,
that I'd'cooked fer the big house at Bandybelah
. fer over a month, an’ you know-they are real toffs
there, an’ want everything up ter Dick.
“’E asked me if I ’ad any testimonials—refer-
ences, yer know—an’ I hooked ’em obt o’ me
pocket an’ flashed ’em at ’im along with me Union
ticket. \E read ’em, an’ said, ‘Yer’ll want a
pretty big screw fer all that skill ?!
*‘T ses, ‘ No, I qn’y want the regular rate—four
bob .a man a week, me ter find me own slushy, or
two slushies fer a big job. Many .ter cook fer
’ere ?’ I asked.
“’E ses about four ’undred a week, an’ a
thousand show week an’ races.
“Eighty quid a week I makes it, .Tack. Say
ten quid fer slushies, an’ that leaves seventy
clear bunce. I tell yer, Jack, rae mouth fairly
watered.
“’E seS ter me ‘Where did yer learn?’an’l
told him that I was learned by Billy Burton, the
king o’ cooks. .1 Slushied fer ’im fer three
seasons, an’ Billy showed me everything, and I
learned a good bit afterwards.
“’E ses, ‘Yer wouldn’t take a reduction on
that rate?’ Square an’ all, Jack, I was tempted,
but I ses at last, ‘ No, boss, 1 can’t go back on
Union rates. What’d the chaps say ? Four bob
or nothin’ an’ find me own slushies, pay fer me
own tucker an’ the slushies’, an’ guarantee the
tucker bill under seventeen bob a week, cook an’
all.’
“He laughed an’ shook ’is shiny’ead, an’ ses,
1 No, Mister ’Arris, you must go and babble some-
where else. Yer too expensive fer a town.’
“Then I offered ter cook ’im or any one else ’e
could dig up fer fifty quid ; an’ then I left. Some
blessed blackleg’ll get it at ’arf rates, I suppose.”
George looked thoughtful for a while, and said,
“ Even ’arf rates ! No, be cripes, I won’t cut the
rates fer nobody.
“Yes, it seems a lot o’ money ter chuck away,
Jack, but look at the work an’ brain power that’s
wanted ter reckon exactly what the blokes ’ll eat
without waste. I alius allows double quantity,
cooked rough, fer the fust ten days; They’re just
off the track, an’ too ’ungry ter be particular, an’
there ain’t a whimper till the kidneys is lined.
The fust week you’ll see a ’eap o’ bones alongside
their plate, like’s if a sheep had died there, and
on’y the skeleton’s left. On the ’leventh day they
ses, ‘ Babbler, w’en are yer goin’ ter give us some
fancy stuff?’ Then I know the time’s come ter
put in me fine work, an’ I dishes up all sorts o’
pritty things, coachnill fer red, turmeric fer yaller,
an’ burnt, sugar fer brown ; I tell yer, Jack, I’m
an artist. Yet the beggars growl even with me.
Why, I ’ail a snipe-nosed New England cocky
on’y last year who kicked up ’ell becos the bloo-
rnonge was cold. I settled ’im in one act by
offerin’ ter chuck up the job there an’ then. The
others ’ad ter smooge an’ crawl ter me ter square
things, an’ ’e got fits. . , . But I can . talk fer a
week on cookin’ an’ then not be done. Now,
Jack, I’m stony, can yer do anything fer me? ”
I could, and I did, So the next day saw us
both on our way to the best country for a true
man in the whole earth —the West.

An Afternoon on the Yarra.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was willows—willows all the way, with
here and there a poplar. Our boats glided
like wind-loosened leaves across the water,
steered by the breeze and kissed by the sun and
shadow in turn.
The fainting turquoise of the sky smote the
river to azure—the sweet dream azure, that laughs
under the lashes of a baby naiad. And it was
willows, willows all the way, with here and thme
a poplar.
Willows ? Their loose tresses brushed the
ripples as they bowed to gaze at their fair reflec-
tions. Poplars ! Their silvery ripple resembled a
sea under moonlight.
Sometimes a cow lifted its head to watch us
pass—a calm, still-eyed creature, knee-deep in
bracken. Or a hawk sailed tense-winged through
the heavens. Or a butterfly alighted to softly
kiss our hands. Clematis waved on 'the banks,
and feathery grasses; sparrows and minahs
chatted confidentially in the trees, while the sun
sank slowly, slowly under his red coverlet in the
burning fiery-furnace-like West. Our tea was
served in a tiny Chinese-lantern-hUng shed,
through whose open door we could see the boat-
man’s pretty garden, and immediately the repast
was concluded we strolled down to the river bank
again to seat ourselves on a bench under the
willows, and remained very still ana silent while
the water swayed dreamily to and fro in the
gentle evening breeze.
It was twilight when we tore ourselves away,
four happy, tired mortals, burry as to our gar-
ments, briar-rosey as to our breasts, with the love
of the river singing softly in our hearts.
To-day, worn with the glare and whirl of the
streets, I shut my eyes and once more drift where
it was willows, willows all the way, with here
and there a poplar.

16 “ MITCHELL ” DRILLS
ON ONE ESTATE.
Gentlemen, —The “Mitchell”
Drills (16 in number) purchased
by our share farmers on this
Estate have given every satisfac-
tion, and I have much pleasure
in testifying to their all-round
capabilities. Some of these
machines have drilled one
thousand acres each without
costing a fraction for duplicates.
I certainly consider the
“ Mitchell ” Drill the best on the
market, and strongly recommend
anyone requiring a drill to take
no other.
(Sgd.) J. MURRAY,
Manager.
the. best must win.

able Bush for Main
Wheels.
A Bush that makes the Wheel run like
a buggy wheel.

can be replaced at any time.
An exclusive “ Mitchell” patent.
This Bush gives our wheel the “pitch*
and “ gather.”
We DON’T use a Stub Axle.

A Steel Wheel,' with a Wooden Felloe—indestructible.
The Tyre can always be kept tight.

No. 4
12 Reasons why
“The Mitchell** is the Best.
It h is a Grain Feed that sows all kinds of
Seeds, and does it with greater regularity than
any other Drill.
It has a Manure Feed that sows positively ANY
manure, regardless of what condition it is in.
The Grain Speed Gear is a quick change
straight Spur Drive, which cannot slip and miss
sowing. See Cut 3.
Hie Change Gear for Fertiliser is easily and
quickly operated, has a wide range of quantity,
and is specially strong.
Mitchell” Main Wheels are known every-
where for their strength. Spokes are removable ;
Tyres 34 inches wide, over Blackwood Felloes.
See Cut 2.
Wheels run on Patent Removable Bushes,
which set them out at the top and in at the bottom
like waggon-wheels. An exclusive Mitchell
patent. See Cut 4.
Grain and Fertiliser Tubes are made of Ribbon
Steel—indestructible.
Main Frame is one piece of Angle Steel, with a
Bed Rail of I Steel—a tower of strength.
Hoes and Disks are interchangeable. * Mitchell ’
Drills can be used as Hoe or Disk Drills, and the
same draw bars do for both.
It is a Drill that is honestly built throughout.
Unly the best material is used in its construction.
It is a particularly easy Drill to operate. Every-
thing s handy. There is no complicated mechanism
about the “ Mitchell.”
It is made in Australia, by Australian work-
men, with Australian capital, and specially for
Australian Farmers.

The COMMON
HOUSE FLY
is a Dang'er to
Human Life.
/EvferjyTJyisfc.
Mm\ Killer
at Heart.
IT'S hairy body* carries botb disease
and deatb. Having' its origin in
filth, it brings with it the bacteria
which breeds in filth. And as it moves
about, now crawling over refuse, now
over the food of the table, flying from the lips of the sicK to
the lips of the healthy, it is said to be more dangerous to
modern society than were the wild beasts to primitive man.
The high mortality among children in the congested
districts of a city, where families are closely crowded together,
where refuse accumulates fast, where food is often Kept in
living rooms, is due to a large degree, so scientists now say, to
the fly. Infant diseases chiefly prevail in summer, when the
flies abound.

possesses the qualities which render INSECTIBANE so peculiarly efficacious*

Inferior Starches are sometimes substituted by unscrupulous traders for “Silver Star.” To prevent this, you should see that
every package bears the “Silver Star” label. Refuse to take loose Starch—you will then get “Silver Star” every time.

Some Dingoes and Bill.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SVEN sold him to the Finns, and they
carried him aboard a timber schooner.
Finns have no ideas concerning a bull-
dog’s welfare. When one of them had an hour to
spare, he put in the time feeding Bill. Everybody
fed him, and the only dish he didn’t fancy was
Irish stew. Oscar Olsen tried with a Oft. plank
to make Bill eat Irish stew. Bill got a grip on
the plank-end. and the Finn knocked him against
the bulkhead. Bill shivered. The mighty Finn
swung him again, but Bill slithered down the
plank and swung the giant into a pan of frying
meat inside the cookhouse.
The story of Bill’s life would make tedious
reading; it was all fight. During his occasional
spells ashore he noticed that other dogs found
leisure to gather at odd corners and make friendly
appointments ; they found time to bark and worry
a sleepless neighborhood. Bill never did any of
these things; he rarely joked or kept people
awake at night.
When a long chain had prevented him from
pursuing a literary calling, he would lie with his
chin in the dust and single out passing dogs that
wore an unemployed appearance. He made hasty
notes of the large, detached dog that put on airs
when it passed the butcher opposite. Bill never
forgot those dogs ; he arrived at them one by one
in his spare time. The result was always the
same; a sharp, savage scuffle, and then a dog’s
body being bumped violently on the pavement.
Bill always implied afterwards that he could mend
a broken footpath in three minutes with any dog
under 40lb.
Schooner life did not agree with Bill. There
were rats in the hold, but his face was too big to
dig into crevices, his neck too short to nip them
as they scuffled round him. The Finns had
brought a large red city cat aboard ; she kept the
rats in order and amused Bill.
One night Bill beheld a strange scene on the
schooner’s deck. Three Finns sat round a cask
of rum and began to drink. There was a moon
on the starboard quarter, a long stretch of busli-
wrapped coast on the port. From time to time
the Finn at the wheel addressed the drinkers
sternly, but they regarded him sombrely, and
held up their glasses.
Later, a wild and horrible fight began that in-
tern ited Bill, because the man Borka, who fed
him most, was attacked by the others. Bill re-
mained neutral until Borka’s sullen cry for help
decided him. Pinning a scuffling giant by the
neck he brought him howling to the deck.
A temporary peace was arranged to allow the
wounded Borka and the dog to be put ashore.
Some food and water were placed in the boat, and
they were landed at the mouth of a sandy inlet
and left on the beach.
The Finn crawled into the sand licking his
swollen lips. A big knife-cut gaped on his
baresark chest. He wiped it sulkily with his
hand and looked at the dog.
Bill slunk away and lay down. The schooner
picked up the boat and stood away on the sky-
line. The Finn regarded the coast with dnil,
unseeing eyes. Black stretches of bush-clad
ridges filled the north and south. The surf broke
in loud, thunderous heaps at his feet. He lay down
and closed his eyes, but the pain of the knife-
wound kept him awake till dawn.
“lam not well, Beel,” he said, huskily. The
dog regarded him steadily. A collie would have
bounded over at sound of his voice, but Bill only
watched the hurt man and blinked.
The sun beat through the heavy coast mist. A
jagged cape sloped towards the surf-line ; the dull
booming of the waves marked each moment of the
desolation.
“ Beel ! ” The Finn crawled to his elbow, and
fell back gasping. “ I vas hurt, Beel.”
THE HIGHER CRITICISM.
BLACK GIN (to carpenter at work, scorn-
fully): “ You call yourself a carpenter!
Why , you couldn't make a plurry pannikin!”
The afternoon Wore on. The pain of the knife-
cut grew large, until it gripped his arms and
breast like a stream of molten lead. His head
became a volcano of activity, but at dawn the
furies left him, taking with them the red children
of pain, that bite with lion’s teeth. A barque
heaved across the horizon, then put about and
streamed towards the rising sun.
Bill moved uneasily in the sand ; a hoarse
whimper broke from him. With uplifted paw he
tapped, tapped the Finn’s breast. Then he ran
back and crouched on a wave-worn ridge. The
receding tide left the beach white and desolate.
Gulls drowsed aimlessly about a wet sand strip.
The dog returned and rifled the package of food
with his nose, then stopped suddenly and looked
at the Finn. A- big yellow fly swung over Bill’s
nose ; then another and another. A savage im-
patience came over the dog. He ran to the edge to
drink, but the water stayed bitter in his mouth.
He lay with panting sides in the cool wet sand.
A red moon swam with theatrical stealth across
the bush ; it stood over a forest-clad ridge for a
moment, like a clock with its face to the sea.
A tremulous howl stole from the Dantesque
scrub. It ran in fleet sobs through the distant
gullies and across the hill overlooking the beach.
Bill, with his nose in the sand, made no move-
ment. His small ears pricked forward slightly,
but his breathing was slow and regular as a sleep-
ing athlete’s.
The howling ceased. A pack of gaunt shapes
lined the sandhill above. Their spindly shadows
flashed here and there. Eyes that grew livid in
the moonlight ran in skirmishing order from
point to point.
A sudden tigerish resentment settled in Bill’s
eyes. He stood up, almost imperceptibly, his big
chest half embedded in sand. A sound like
a human sigh came from him.
Three lank shapes trotted towards the beach,
and drew up stiffly within stone-throw of the
supine Finn. Bill raised himself about two
inches, and they vanished with flying strides.
Five gaunt shadows now approached the Finn.
One, a long-snouted ruffian with shark’s eyes,
dashed in, unmindful of the white plug-shaped
thing sitting at the Finn’s head.
Hunger presided like a live god in the salt
night air. The loping dingo shape swerved from
his brothers, and as he swung past the supine
body he snatched like a jackal. Then some-
thing seemed to knock his legs from under him,
and he rolled ten yards, with Bill tearing his
throat away.
The moon grew white as a tortured face. Across
the long shadow-clothed ridge sat the spindly
marauders, and they howled at Bill. At dawn,
when the hunger-god pinched with both hands, a
line of dingo faces approached the beach.
The white plug stood motionless for a while as
a spike of reef in the sand. Then it stole out to
meet them, and they vanished like rabbits across
the sand. Bill trotted back dejectedly, and lay
within a yard of the Finn’s outstretched hand.
A. great silence came upon the beach. The
sand drifted in small heaps under the Finn’s
mouth and chin. Sand filled his open palms. It
blew over his clothes and crawled into his big
pockets. At midday it almost screened his body
from view.
Bill rolled in the water, and watched the in-
numerable crabs rustling over the tide-swept
spaces. Then he looked at the Finn, and his tail
hung. A moment later he was barking hoarsely,
and dancing in the water.
More white sand shroud d the quiet figure. A
band of crows settled incidentally on the sand
ridge. Bill shook water from his back, and
rolled on the hot beach.
He slept with his jaw on the Finn’s boot The
sunlight showed through his thin, white ears,
and the keen, wind-driven sand stung him like
duck-shot. Lifting himself quickly, he settled
on the lee side of the Finn.
Suddenly the yellow gang appeared on the hill-
top and watched Bill. A council of spindly legs
was formed to discuss the unreasonableness of
Bill. They roamed the distant beach in circling
groups ; they made crude feint-attacks to draw
him from the Finn. Bill’s body twisted occasion-
ally so that his nose always faced them.
Then they regarded him with stiff ears and
friendly eyes. Two of them, leggy and quick as
wolves in the matter of side-loping, approached
with ambassadorial frankness. They trotted near
as though anxious to put forward certain views in
a friendly and lucid spirit. It was distinctly
understood that there was to be no fighting.
Bill appeared overcome by such generosity and
refinement, and when the nearest ambassador
loped near the Finn’s exposed hand, Bill seemed
to leap from his belly across Borka’s body.
A sharp howl of dismay broke from the council
on the hill. The sight of their ambassador rolling
in agony with a white plug attached to his throat
was distressing to their dingo nerves.
Bill, with a red, gaping mouth, slunk to the
water, and lay with heaving sides until the waves
lapped over his back. Then he returned to the
Finn and lay down.
A sudden calm came upon the dingoes. They
receded from view. Bill whined uneasily. With
pointed ears and half-closed eyes he saw a sleek,
yellow shape sidling towards him across the beach.
A dingo slut, with alert eyes and finely-rounded
head, picked her way through the drifts with
great precision. Her eyes were soft and full of
pity for Bill. She stayed on a wave-worn margin
to wash her paws, and lick back the stiff hair
under her throat.
Bill looked confused, and for no particular
reason sat up and growled. The new ambassa-
dress pricked her ears. She gave a soft whining
note that seemed to depress Bill. Thrusting his
nose into the Finn’s sleeve, he watched her with a
policeman’s eye.
She was not afraid of Bill. She regarded the
blood on his jaws with tender melancholy. There
was no hurry in her movements, only elegance
and sympathy.
Bill was impressed. She was standing over
him, her lean sides quivering with excitement, her
ears drooped forward. She began slowlv to lick
the blood drops from his shoulders and flanks.
Bill rolled lazily in the sand while she hit him
softly on the ribs. Bill affected a sudden rage,
and sprang up, his tail moving like a thin lash.
The elegant one lay on her side and kicked
sand over him. Bill harked hoarsely and invited
her to go with him into the water. He rushed in,
tearing round and round, swimming strongly
against the tide.
She shook herself on the water’s edge, but
would not wet her feet. She trotted after him.
whining lamentably as though afraid he would
drown.
Bill suddenly remembered something and re-
turned hastily to where the Finn lay in his shroud
of sand. The slut sniffed suspiciously, wandering
in a wide circle round the body. Then she trotted
off gently towards the hill.
Bill stood up in surprise. She halted, with her
long ears thrown forward, and called him. Bill,
with an uneasy glance at the Finn, followed.
Arriving at the hill-top the pair looked back. A
hump of sand indicated where the Finn lay. The
sun had set behind the illimitable forest.
A moment later and the pack raced round the
side of the hill towards the beach. The old-men
dingoes led the way—the old sand-diggers and
body-thieves. Behind them ran the stiff-eared,
yelping pups.
Bill watched them with the grief of Antony in
his heart, while Cleopatra, with the long ears and
the tender eyes, licked his face.

Trimmin' Coal.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE are chaps whose lights are hidden
By the coal-dust and the gloom
Of the bunkers
(Steamer’s bunkers)
Near the hummin’ engine-room.
You can hear the stokers toilin’
And the greasers as they go
To the testin’ and the oilin’
Of the rods that swing and throw ;
But few men e’er see the glimmer
In the blackness of the coal
Of the slush-light of the trimmer
As it gutters to her roll.
There’s a thousand tons o’ Westport
To be shifted to the fires
From the bunkers
(Steamer’s bunkers),
And that’s when a man perspires.
When the bulkhead plates are sweatin’,
And the air is foul and thick,
And the engineers are callin’
Out for coal. “ And bring it quick ! ”
Makes you wish you were a-swimmin’
In the ice around the Pole,
’Stead of trimmin’, trimmin’, trimmin’,
At the steamer’s bunker coal.
When God made the world, I reckon,
He just mixed it in a pot,
Dark as bunkers
(Steamer’s bunkers)
Also just about as hot.
When He’d moulded it and shaped it,
Till it seemed a perfect thing,
He gave every man a label,
From the pauper to the king.
And I guess the lights were dimmer
When He sorted out a soul,
And put it in a trimmer,
And said, “ You trim the coal.”
For the stoker gets the down-draught,
And the greasers have the fan,
But the bunkers
(Steamer’s bunkers)
Ain’t no place to put a man.
There’s the darkness that you see there,
And the darkness that you feel,
And the everlastin’ grindin’
Of the coal beneath your heel.
Up on deck the men and women
Laugh to feel her easy roll—
They don’t know the way we’re trimmin’
At the cruel, slidin’ coal.
When the peons coal at Rio,
They form lines and pass the coals
For the bunkers
(Steamer’s bunkers)
Up in little wooden bowls.
They are dirty, lazy beggars,
And are v#orth a bob a day—
But we wheel our coal in barrows
When the bunker’s far away.
And such bunkers, when we’re trimmin’
With our sweatin’ shoulders bare,
Ain’t no place to sing a hymn in,
Or to offer up a prayer.
I have pondered in a silence
That has lasted forty years,
Why the bunkers
(Steamer’s bunkers)
Have such stuffy atmospheres.
There’s the wind and sun from heaven '
Wastin’ by the blessed yard,
And we are in the bunkers
Of a steamer, breathin’ hard.
Guess the molly-hawks a-skimmin’
Would be tickled if they knew
We were in the coal-dust trimmin’
When the skies are clear and blue.
When God made the world, I reckon
That He made it really well
’Cept the bunkers
(Steamer’s bunkers),
And they were made in hell.
To the East and West He sent us
To a job He thought would fit.
Said He, “ You will fail or prosper
Just according to your grit.”
Yet the fate of none was grimmer
When He took a poet’s soul
And put it in a trimmer,
And said, “ You trim the coal!”

SUNDRY
SONGS
FOR THE BULLETIN
On the Pier.
FAR out, where a path of silver leads
over the tumbling sea,
In the sweep of the murmuring waters,
a fish leaps suddenly,
And the wind comes out of the distance, out from
the heart of the night,
And along the shore where the high road runs
there hovers a moving light;
A swinging lamp on the jetty, a moving light on
the shore,
And sobbing against the red cliff the ocean’s stir
and roar,
While over the boom of the surges, pathetic and
faint and thin,
There wails from the town the fretting of a
grieving violin.
Black at the jetty entrance, where the white sand
meets the seas,
Bulky sentinels of the shore, loom up the cotton-
wood trees;
On the crest of the esplanade, at the curve of the
Lovers’ Walk,
A flowering aloe leans far back, wind bent, on its
slender stalk.
A ragged line of ironbarks, a Moreton fig tree
high,
Shut out the houses of the town and a patch of
star-flecked sky ;
And a lonely bunya spreads its arms, as though it
mourned to know
That far on the mist-blue mountains its sundered
brethren grow.
Wash of the whispering waters round the great,
sea-rotted piles,
Breezes wandering round us that have followed
the salt wet miles.
The little, mean thoughts have left us, the gossip
and strife and pain
Of shut-in cities seem as though they never could
hurt again ;
Not from the voice of the chapel, pent in by the
busy marts,
Does the message of Love eternal steal to our
jaded hearts;
Not in the heated churches, bending low on our
board-cramped knees,
But in the boom of the surges, and the truths of
• the wise old seas.

OUT-BACK,
By Budgee Wurra, on the Junee track,
I met a hairy chap called Tangil Tim,
And camped with him.
Says he :
“ You’d think it queer, a tony bloke like me
Should hump his swag and little bit o’ scran,
An’ billycan.
“ Look here—
I’ll make yer squint yer eyes, though I appear
A common ’coot. You’re very much mistook,
’Cos I’m a Dook 1
“ One time
I ’ad me flunkeys an’ me palace prime ;
But I got full o’ pomp an’ feeds in state —
I chucked it, mate.'
“ You see,
It’s likes this ’ere. Lord Balfour says to me :
‘ Say, Dook, come down and hear some language
plain
In the Domain.’
“ And there
We ’eared a delegate speak fair and square.
’E showed us wot a wicked life we led—
That’s wot ’e said.
“ An’ when
I knew I’d poled upon me feller men,
I chucked me job—don’t think I want to brag—
An’ took me swag.
“ An’ so
Though I’m a Dook, I never like to blow.
I’ve set a good example now to lots
Of other Pots ! ”
His Grace
Be fixed his blackened briar in his face ;
He curled up in a quiet plebeian heap
And went to sleep.
And I
I pondered drowsily his harmless lie.
And cursed, in that it marred the night’s repose,
His ducal nose.

UP, for the Orient sun smiles through
the Gate;
. Without, two white-winged cruisers
wheel and wait,
As from the North Head’s
rugged profile flung,
See, jets of flying spume as
pale as Hate.
The homing wave flings high
her fringe of snow
Up, ’gainst the sombre rock, and to
and fro
Sends loops of seething foam athwart
the blue,
Which, circling, shade the emerald
under-tow.
Isles—harbor—isles, rose-saffron in the
sun,
And many a jutting headland ; day
begun
With joyous smile beams fondly on the
bay
And all the rills and rivers as they run.
Fair cove (where once a farm) with crescent beach
Of gracious contour ; gently-curving reach,
Dark woods that seaward dip, with dappled shade,
And sand-stone ledges in the sun that bleach.
At anchor here, in conscious majesty,
A saucy frigate ; masts that pierce the sky ;
With grinning guns in tiers, and nettings white,
And flags and pennant wrinkling as they fly.
In at the bowsprit’s heel the sentinel
With beaming bayonet sloped ; a sweet-toned bell
Chimes o’er the water from the waking town,
Where yet another sentry'cries “ All’s well.”
Those white-sailed boats laid over by the breeze
Plough the glad wave past all those rocking trees,
As rolling, rush, out-boomed across the bay,
The youthful vikings of our inner seas.
And here, half-pausing (arms mid-air), a mill;
And there, another on that cot-crowned hill,
With cottages below, in steps and stairs,
And bow-pot glories on each window-sill.
Another sun soars glorious o’er the bay.
Where now the tavern of a former day,
With generous tankard frothing, silver-bright,
And all those boon companions? Where? Oh,
say !
And where that house, whose roof-tree used to
ring
To music of the time when George was King,
Brave songs of Braham, Incledon and Arm
That fading o’er the starlit wave took wing ?
Lo ! the fair cove half-girdled by a wall,
The Viceroy’s keep beyond, where shadows fall
In broken breadths o’er mullioned windows deep,
As swing the creaking boughs of pine-trees tall.
Islands on Islands— these our isles of yore ?
And forts where fortresses were none before ;
Our one tower vanished, glory of the cove,
Whose warm reflection glads the wave no more.
No saucy frigate all a-taunto here,
But, couched upon the plain of azure clear,
A grey sea-dragon with her mailed brood,
O’er-canopied with smoke, at anchors veer.
The flag the same ; each wavering pennant’s tail
Floats like a gossamer out o’er the rail.
Brave Hearts of Oak the same ’neath ribs of steel
Where prisoned steam usurps the realms of sail.
Dazed as I gaze, I pray me for the night
To dream, to-morrow’s sun, still burning bright,
Were standing in the Gate between the Heads,
To bring once more of other days the light
And grant me of his grace but one day more
In Feast of Fancy by this Dear Old Shore.

The Bull=Ant.
HIS kingdom is the Bush, where his wild
reign
Seems undisputed since the world
began.
He brooks no trespassers on Ins domain ;
His favorite food is rump steak —off a man.
His boundaries are unfenced, however far
They reach, and, though extensive, if he stood
A notice up denoting where they are,
Man might respect his claims—in fact, man ivould.
And yet some limit to his realms should be.
A bull-ant should not be allowed to take
Away the bush, but leave a bit that we
Can look at without treading on a snake.
He builds no heap like other ants, but makes
A paltry hole, just deep enough to use
For treachery ; erecting ant-heaps takes
Up too much biting-time for him to lose.
He gives no signal of his dire approach,
Which seems to be implacably designed,
But, lurking ’neath the turf where you encroach,
Assaults you unawares—and from behind.
Hence meditative mortals, who would fain
A tranquil slumber in the sunshine take,
Must, seeking uninfested spots in vain,
Sit on a bit of tin, and keep awake.
From those who meet him oft and pick him out
Of picnic pies and potted meats and jams
When bliss seems nigh ! —from those, without a
doubt,
Arise the vast majority of “damns.”
I’ve swelled the score myself while looking round
To find a spot, but gave up in despair ;
No matter where I sat upon the ground,
A bull-ant or a cow-ant would be there.

“COM INC-OUT!”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f *HE long, long days of waiting,
M The fussing and the feting,
£ All are done.
Exalted is my mother,
Her hopes she cannot smothei —
Foolish one !
Oh, if I fail or stumble,
How can I weep or grumble
For her sake ?
She thinks I've grace and beauty.
Ah! All her love and duty
Are an ache.
For homely are my features ;
I am like many creatures,
Commonplace.
It hurts to make confession —
There’s not a sweet expression
In my face.
So should I stand neglected,
A debutante affected
With the blight,
My soul will writhe in anguish
A s there I wilt and languish
Through the night.
Oh, men, dear men, take pity !
Tell mother I am pretty —
Let me dance!
Her eyes with pride are beaming,
With hope her heart is dreaming,
And romance.
I'm waiting, satin-laden,
A plain suburban maiden,
For the cab.
All thought is agitating,
I'm pale with fright and waiting —
Pale and drab.
And now my father rushes
To raise my nervous blushes
With his kiss ;
And mother, beaming, blooming,
My bouquet is perfuming
In her bliss.
Oh, misery ! Oh, mother !
0 would I were another
Sort of girl!
A Juno, gay, audacious,
A beauty, sweet and
gracious —
Peach or pearl.
Alas, no joys uphold
me !
Hoic will men leant
to fold me
In their arras 1
They only go a-
dancing
With Vcnuses en-
trancing,
Full of charms.
And I shall stand
dejected,
Alone , despised,
neglected,
Without doubt.
Oh, hoio the
thought en-
rages !
Oh, worst of all
life's stages—
Coming out!

The Ruined Forest.
WE rode through ruins black and bare,
A barren landscape vast and wide,
With, heaps of ashes here and there,
And blasted trunks on every side.
The leaves hung dead upon the limbs —
Alas ! for all their green array,
Their greeting song and matin hymns
When breezes came at break of day !
The forest kings had fallen loiv —
Their strength in dust, their beauty slain—
Dawn’s glory and the sunset glow
Would never light their domes again.
In that black land no sylvan grief
Sighed soft regret for what had been—
No anthem for the perished leaf,
No requiem for the forest green.
We talked of cities fired in war,
And falling walls, and flying feet,
And tumult surging near and far,
And shouting square, and flaming street
“But fallen tower and temple wrecked,’’
We said, as we rode side by side,
“ The mason and the architect
May raise again in all their pride.
“ This green cathedral forest, arched
And aisled and riaved, and filled by day
With golden light, when ruin marched
Upon its glory, passed away.
“ Its dome is low, its choir is stilled,
Its columns scattered ash and wood—
Who shall replan its shape, and build
The miracle as once it sto.od ?
“ Not any art that finds its home
In man —his tireless hand and brain—
Shall raise its green and spacious dome,
Or fill its choir with song again.”
Yet, ere the night had drawn a shroud
O’er that dead scene, and day had ceased,
There rose a great rain-laden cloud —
The Builder coming from the East.

The Surf-Reapers.
WHO will sing the song of the strong surf
reapers,
The glad, crisp anthem of spirits free,
Who will paint the sheen of the keen surf-leapers,
Alert and flushed with the kiss of the sea ?
In the foam a-waist and the taste of ocean,
Lies hallowed joy to the bather’s soul,
In the froth’s embrace and the grace of motion,
In the sweet salt sting as the waves unroll.
As a seagull flees with the sea’s rough wooing,
And flirts brave wings in the wave’s wild swirl,
With abandon proud and a loud hallooing
We skim the crest as the breakers curl.
As a fish that swims o’er the rims of boulders.
Can poise unharmed in the seething foam,
So we float and glide in the tide till shoulders
Gleam bronze and gold on the margin chrome.
And the glad-limbed girl in the swirl beside me,
Serenely guileless of prudish shame,
Has the comrade-sense —innocence—to guide me,
Though charms she rarer than gods could name.
For the smooth skin glows with a rose-hue,
slieenly,
And semi-tints of elusive tone,
And the lips are sins ; but the chin’s so queenly.
Her heart is crisp as the wild sea’s own.
And a subtle spell in the swell steals o’er me,
Suggestive, vague as the sea-heart’s joy,
And the sprites of wave and of cave call for me
To bear my sea-bride where mermaids toy.
And the lure grows strong till I long to lead her
Far over the breakers, and swim and swim
Till we come to the Isle Volatile, and meed her
With jewels that hang on the world’s blue rim.
In the rose-gold rays as we laze and slumber,
The sea’s soft tang breathing rhythmic rest,
There are no wild throes to oppose or cumber,
And dream-elves flirt on the dream-sand’s breast.
And the men-haunts seem but a dream of terror.
Where weird souls war with a weirder targe,
And the greed for power seems the flower of error,
And life is real on the brown-sand marge.

The Grass Bachelor,
MY wife’s away—three blessed months of
freedom
(A hundred days and nights) are all my
own,
A hundred days—God knows, I sorely need' Vil—
My franchised nose is lifted from the stone.-
Oh, sunlight breaking through the clouds of grey f
My wife’s away.
My wife’s away —and poor much-married devils,
Whose faithful spouses haunt their board and
bed,
Frown disapproval of my careless revels ;
But envy hides behind each wagging head.
Who cares a straw for “What would Mary
say ? ”
My wife’s away.
My wife’s away—the prison gates are shattered,
Back to old paths my eager course is set,
Back to the days when nothing really mattered,
And life for us held—all that we could get.
Girls ! Theatres ! Suppers ! Picnics down the bay !
My wife’s away.

Black Sheep.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THEY broke from Europe’s prison
With iron nerve and thew,
Who quitted farm and village
To build the world anew ;
Heart-sick of ancient idols,
Decrepit legends, lies—
They sailed below the sunset
To see the new sun rise.
Black Sheep, Black Sheep—stragglers from the field
and fold,
Sick of farm and village and the Old World's load ;
Outward — forward —lust of life and greed of gold,
Yet all to start the White Man down the Open Road.
When Southern Eldorado
Set rebel hearts ablaze
Port Phillip hailed the clippers
That sailed in Roaring Days.
The Ocean of Adventure
Before their vision lay ;
The world was wide, but every tide
Brought Black Sheep down the bay.
Pea-Souper lately landed,
And gaping Johnnie Raw,
In Melbourne’s jumped-up township
What wondrous sights they saw !
Those Chinkies, diggers, troopers,
Strange-clad from boots to hat,
And nugget-hunters, shouting
In the rush to Ballarat!
They pegged in golden gullies
Among the ranges thick,
Heard giant timber crashing,
Earth torn by spade and pick ;
Fixed cradles swaying, rattling
As heads bobbe'd up and down,
From lucky holes .of Fortune,
When camped in Canvas Town.
And digging, wheeling, washing
Where mullock heaps were flung
Bucked in ; then in sly shanty
Swopped yarns, and rough songs sung.
Brave, busy, humming thousands
Beneath that dome of blue ! *
They held the Future visioned
When the New World yet was new.
When digger-hunting rampaged,
And when grim scraps began,
’Twas Black Sheep rose and rallied,
And Black Sheep, man to man,
Behind the pickets planted,
Stopped dauntless, unafraid,
And that flag of Lalor’s hoisted
On Eureka’s old stockade.
Black Sheep, Black Sheep, clearer sighted than we
know,
Dropping pick and cradle in your busy hive
For pike-staff, musket — bravo, towns of calico !
There was better than the wash-dirt in roaring
fifty-five.
Now out beyond the mulga,
Where Afghan camels crawl,
And the vast Westralian sunset
Holds room for one and all;
Far out beyond Kalgoorlie,
Though stampers raged and roared,
They’d leave the lights to battle
For Bay ley’s Great Reward.
From Wilson’s Promontory
To round the Gulf at York
They’re spread, like debris scattered
From Old Nick’s pitching fork ;
From Brisbane to the Leu win,
Port Darwin to the Bight-
On either side the Big Divide
They make the lone land white.
They have no peace but battle,
They have no faith but doubt;
They dread fat, home-fenced pastures,
And Out and Further Out
They stumble towards the sky-line
All haggard, lean, .and blind,
To leave their bones as signals
For those who come behind.
Black Sheep, Black Sheep—all through the Never
Never:
Sand and scrub and desert—swags humped the
furthest track.
Thirst, heat, mirage, salt lake, and dust-dry river,
Their bones are piled like trophies to point the way
Out-Back,
They sweat at Western shearing,
Blew cheques at Bourke and Hay;
Cut scrub, split Gippsland timber,
Drive sledge and bullock dray ;
They muster raging cattle,
And, hell-for-leather band,
Rough-riding overlanders
Surge, clanking through the land.
They love the stress and danger
Of drought, and fire, and flood.
Primeval savage Nature
Has stung their savage blood.
While good sheep graze the pastures
Around their fat, fenced home—
Smooth plains of peace and plenty—
Will ever Black Sheep roam ;
The trackless regions lead them,
Though worn by scab and rot,
To newer lands and truer lands,
The Righteous knoweth not.
While some grow smug and drowsy
The “wasters” battle forth
To guard the Gulf and Barrier
In alien-threatened North ;
With ketch and pearlin’ lugger,
Draw more than shell-rich seas,
They face the monster Asia,
They block slave dynasties.
THE BRUTE.
SHE: “All men are fools.” He: “No, some are bachelors.”
Nor’-East along the Barrier,
Among the Isles of Spice,
Through palm and banyan jungle,
Through swamp, and cane and rice.
Though all looks strange and languid
In vast, voluptuous night,
There —Dawn-lands beckon, dazzling
With tropic-blazing light.
Heart-sick of ancient idols,
Decrepit legends, lies—
They sail beyond the sunset
To see the new sun rise.
They have no peace but battle ;
No faith have they but doubt;
Yet Black Sheep plant the outposts
Of the White Man further out.
Black Sheep, Black Sheep—stragglers from the peace-
ful plain,
Facing monster Asia like fire and fiood and drought.
Northward l downward I —through isles of palm
and rice and cane;
And all to plant the outposts of the White Man
further out.

LOUIS ESSON.
The Homing of Jestison.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
JESTISON was going home, and his
dominant idea was tiiat he must not let his
landlady hear him returning at that hour of
the night. There were reasons. He was stealthily
opening the front gate when there flashed in on
him a thought which made him quake and set the
gate swaying to his touch. What if she had not
gone to bed—if she were still sitting in the back
parlor beside which he must pass? Jestison
steadied himself, and reflected. She was an early
retirer, and it was now late. How late he was
not sure. He took out his watch, but the
dial was merely a meaningless blank in the
dim light. He pocketed the useless article,
still reflecting. He recalled that as he
was saying good-night to Rossi ter at the
corner a neighboring tower-clock had struck the
hour—but what hour ? Jestison remembered one
. . . two. . . . No; he could not remember another
stroke. Say, two o’clock then. Of course, she
must be in bed—and asleep.
Jestison opened the gate with great steadiness,
stepped in, and closed it without noise. He was
positive of that. He crept along the garden walk
with the feet of a cat, reached the front door, and
paused listening. Silence! With infinite patience,
working silently in the dark, he inserted his
latch-key in the lock, and—clutched the door-post
in sudden fright, asking himself what was that.
A low, wailing sound, gradually rising and ex-
panding into a nerve-shaking note of agony, had
come from somewhere behind the door. Jestison
shook, and his mind was groping for an explana-
tion. Then he noticed something that was inex-
plicable.
The door was ajar ! What did that mean ?
Jestison was sure he had not opened it—sure,
because the lock was stiff, and creaked in a very
loud fashion if not turned carefully. It was while
he was about to manipulate it so as to make no
noise that that awful cry had come from inside.
He couldn’t have opened the door or he would
have heard it creak. Yet the door was ajar?
What lurked in that dark passage ? He must
traverse that passage to get to his room.
It came to him to strike a match; but, after
reflection, he dared not. The explosion of an
igniting match would be audible over all the
house, and he must get in silently. He tripped
and fell down without any noise. He rose and
stood peering into the black corridor for two long
minutes, seeing nothing, hearing nothing. Then
his jaws snapped. He noiselessly closed the door
behind him. As a rule it made a great disturb-
ance when it closed, but this time its silence was
marvellous.
Of a sudden he realised that here was a situation
that required cool thought. He set himself to
think coolly. The door was behind him ; he
knew that because he had not turned round; Had
he turned round ? Thinking coolly, he was sure
he had not. Well, then, on his right was a wall
extending through the house to a staircase, up
which he must climb. He had only to follow that
wall, and the rest was simple. Providing always
that he did not encounter it —the Creature of
Shrieks. The possibility set little cold waves
rippling along his spine, but he grimly fought
down the fear, and sought the wall with extended
THE AUSTRALIAN “ SINBAD.”
Till Death do us part.
hand. Not finding it, he stepped sideways a pace,
still groping. No wall. Another pace, and
another, and yet no wall. He steadied himself
and thought—coolly. That passage was about
four feet wide; he had sidled three paces—say a
foot each time. Three feet. Say his arm ex-
tended —at a low estimate—another two feet.
Five feet in a passage four feet wide ! The im-
possibility of the proposition set Jestison quaking
again. He began to feel himself in a region of un-
realities. And withal there was a terrifying con-
viction that It was lurking somewhere at his feet.
Involuntarily he lifted first one foot, and then the
other, in mortal terror of feeling a clutch at his
ankles.
Another interval of coolness came to him Per
haps his calculations were incorrect. Perhaps he
had not side-stepped three paces. He would trv
again. He did; and deliberately counted his
steps up to ten. No wall! An impulse to sit
down on the floor was checked by a sudden
thought of what he might sit on. Besides, how
could he be sure there was any floor. He swayed
in the darkness, peering and listening. Well
then, if there was no wall to the right, he would
try straight ahead. He extended his hands and
advanced, groping. One, two, three, four .. .
eleven paces, and still emptiness !
Jestison groaned silently. And at that moment
it TitishGcl in on hi in tluit he wn,s moving v tvif
silently ; not once had he heard a sound from his
own footsteps. Ihe sense of unreality deepened.
I rue, he wanted to move silently, but in his per-
plexity he had forgotten the fact. Still lie had
made no noise. Why? Jestison felt himself
growing sick with fear, but he grimly locked his
jaw, and rallied again. He must find that wall!
Ho extended his left hand and side-stepped.
And a little later he stood stock still, and
breathed like a man who had been running. Not
to the right, not ahead, not to the left. Behind
remained. With great decision he turned, and
walked, but found no wall. He didn’t even find a
door, or a stair, or a hat-rack. He found nothing.
Hie fact did not surprise Jestison ; nothing could
surprise him any more. He was in the Land of
Witches.
But—ah ! What was that ? Two greenish Orbs of
light gleamed upon him like twin locomotive head-
lights, from an eminence many, many miles away.
He glared straight into them, with the wide, un-
blinking eyes of the fascinated. He saw them
pale to almost invisibility ; and glow again with a
soft, steady fire that seemed to burn into his
brain. Slowly they moved to the right, momen-
tarily changing to a deep violet; and suddenly
the right Orb vanished with a diabolic flicker,
leaving its fellow glowing with a solitary menace
that almost stilled Jestison’s heart. Then it, too,
vanished.
Jestison breathed deeply, closed his eyes for an
instant, opened them again—and impulsively
crouched. The Orbs were again conning him,
hellish as ever. Suddenly he became conscious
that they were approaching him slowly, slowly,
and without noise. Then abruptly he knew that
they were hurtling towards him through the dark
emptiness, with the speed of things unknown to
mortal man. Ho closed his eyes tightly, and tried
to steady himself for the coming of the shock.
It came—and it was just the soft, caressing touch
lover’s hand might make on his mistress’ hair.
For an instant Jestison was aware that something
was on his shoulder; that something warm
and soft, and with a feel like fur, brushed his
cheek. Then he knew the Thing had flown off
into the darkness, leaving him the mere semblance
of a man, quaking there with shut eyes in a world
of darkness. He stumbled around absently.
After a space, hearing nothing, feeling nothing,
Jestison opened his eyes, and stood glaring over
his shoulder. The Orbs were watching him
wickedly, low down this time, from an inestimable
distance. He knew they were coming at him
again, but with a kind of last-ditch courage, he
kept his eyes open. When the Orbs were still
half-a-mile off, he crouched, half-involuntarily.
lie felt that something had missed his head by a
mere couple of inches. What in the name of all
things in existence was it? Where was he?
Jestison crumpled to the floor —there was a floor—
in terror that left him no strength to longer stand
erect, but in a feeble, unnatural sort of way his
brain was working. What was it? The Orbs
were unblinkingly regarding him from a
height.
The names of all the monsters
extant or extinct, that Jestison had
ever heard of came galloping into his
memory. An advertisement picture-
poster of a Prehistoric Group, lately
seen, obtruded itself upon his vision.
The Pterodactyl? Somewhere in his
head a rational brain-cell was shouting
at him in dead silence that it was im-
possible ; that the pterodactyl—the
winged saurian—had been extinct for
ages. But Jestison did not heed.
Anyhow, the thing was there ! Jestison
wondered if it was a flying tramcar.
No matter. It was horrid, hellish, and
—it was coming again 1
Jestison slid along the floor to avoid
it. He raked down, still without any
noise as far as he could afterwards re-
member, a chair, a hat-stand, four hats,
two umbrellas, a small table and a pot-
plant, and he knocked his head against
something else. All the furniture that
he had been previously unable to find
seemed to come to him simultaneously.
Still he was sure there had been no
noise. Noise was impossible; it seemed
that all the noises that ever were to be
had crystallised and gone out in that
scream he had heard ages ago at the
front door. Still he rolled, and slid,
and gasped on the floor amid the furni-
ture and the ruins, dodging the Orbs,
which he knew were It —the Creature
of Shrieks. And then of a sudden he
felt something soft and clinging. He
leapt to his feet, darted forward blindly,
and brought up sharp against what he
felt was a prosaic, matter-of-fact stair-
case. He was glad that even in the
rush and the Concussion he had done
nothing to arose the house.
The shock brought him back to earth.
He realised himself at home again. He
listened, and thought. It was essential
that there should be no noise. The
kitten —she generally slept on the
stairs, and if he trod on her she would
yell. He whispered softly “Puss,
puss ! ” He thought he heard a gentle
purr somewhere beneath him, and re-
membering that the kitten was accus-
tomed to leap on his shoulder to be
caressed he grew suddenly very silent,
and groped upstairs. He did not want
the kitten just then.
He felt his way, still trembling, into his room,
closed the door behind him, lit a candle, and
stared about him like a man awakening from a
drug. Gradually the sight of the familiar, .home-
like room-appurtenances in a measure restored
him. He stood before the mirror, and solemnly
stared at his dishevelled image. Then he ex-
changed cunning winks with the image.
“’Sail ri’, ole boy. Got — hie —in without
makin’ any— hie —noise. Tol’— hie —Rossiter I
c’d—get in—without disgrashin’ ’self before—lire
—lan’lady. Ross’ter wanted—take me home—
his place, in —hie —cab. Ross’tcr’s a—hie —’toshi-
cated fool.”
Jestison looked at his watch. He was surprised
to find it 1.15 o’clock.
Then he fell silently on the floor and slept.

SOME GOLDEN RULES.


Graham’s Old Man.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Rev. Donald M'Phadrick was pay-
ing oije of his monthly visits to Brulong,
and, as was his wont, had put up at
Graham’s.
Graham did not take kindly to the rev. gentle-
man, but Mrs. Graham was highly honored that
he should select her humble abode to stay at, so
Graham held his peace.
After tea the saver of souls held forth to the
family on things spiritual—the boarders from the
railway works having fled out for a walk. He
also mentioned that he had but lately received
news from the old land of the death of his aged
father, and told feelingly of the many noble quali-
ties of the departed.
Graham removed his pipe from his mouth, spat
out of the window, and shook his head.
“Ah, brother,” said the Bearer of the Word,
“my words perhaps bring to your mind sweet
thoughts of your own dear father, no doubt long
since gone to his rest. Yet grieve not; he is not
lost, but merely gone before.”
“I dunno about that,” said Graham. “He’s
bin lost f’r a long time as far as I’m concerned. I
never heard of his pegging out, either. I fancy
he’s still humpin’ his drum somewhere out back.”
“Your father living ! You surprise me,” said
the parson. “ And you do not know his where-
abouts ? ”
“No, never heard of him this thirty year. He
left home suddenly when I was a nipper. In
fact, the ole woman and the boys hunted him out.”
“Sad, very sad!” sighed” M'Phadrick. “A
father turned adrift on the world. My friend,
if you think your father still lives, it is your duty
to find him. Forgive and forget the past. May-
be he needs a home in his declining days. Do
not, ah ! do not let his grey hairs go down in
sorrow to the grave. Perhaps I, even I, may be
the humble instrument to once more unite a
father and son.”
“ How’m I goin’ to find him ?” asked Graham.
“Advertise. If he lives, someone will sooner
or later acquaint him of the good news.”
After the shepherd had retired for the night,
Graham discussed the matter with his wife.
“ Wouldn’t be a bad idea ter have th’ ole cove
here,” he said. “ He’d be handy about ther place,
feedin’ the pigs, milkin’, nursin’ the baby an’
sichlike, an’ his ole age pension’ll come in handy.
Yes, I’ll take the parson’s advice, an’ put an
adver-tisement in th’ paper.”
* * * *
It was just about sundown and dinner-time at
Graham’s. Graham was busy carving for the
boarders, when his wife called him.
Going to the kitchen he saw an aged swagman,
hat in hand, standing at the door.
“What’s up?” growled Graham. “Can’t y’send
these coves off without botherin’ me ? Now, you
get out! I’ve got nothin’ to spare for cadgers,
y’ on’y wastin’ y’ time callin’ here.”
“Pm not cadgin’,” said the traveller. “ I come
to see the boss.”
“ Well, that’s me.”
“Jimmy Graham ?”
“Yes.”
“My oath, I wouldn’er knowed yer Jimmy !
You have growed.”
“Now, no funny business,” said Graham. “Tell
us wha’ y’ want.”
“ I’ve come home, my boy. Don’t y’ know y’
pore ole father ? ”
“ What! You ! Well, I’ll be .”
Graham held his sides and laughed. “ Mother,”
he gasped, “ what d’yer think er this cove f’r a
father-in-law ? ”
“I didn’t expect to be laughed at,” said the old
man. “ I ain’t’andsome, an’ 1 bin misfortunit;
but I’m y’r father right enough.”
“Well, I don’t remember much about me ole
man,” said Graham; “but I thought he was a
different style of beauty to you, an’ smaller.
How’m I goin’ to identify y’, anyhow ?”
“I kin satisfy y’ by me papers that I’m Bill
Graham,” said the other.
“We’ll go into it later on,” said Graham.
“ Mother, get the old cove some tucker.”
Graham returned to the dining-room. The
swagman followed, and his dog brought up the rear.
“ Who told y’ ter come in here ? Why couldn’t
y’ stop outside ? ” snapped Graham. But the
other took no notice. He sank into a vacant chair
at the table. The dog put his paws on the table
and his nose in Graham’s plate. -
“D it,” yelled Graham, “take y’r dog
outer this.” He aimed a violent kick at the
hound, but it escaped under the table, growling.
Graham poked his leg under after it and lost part

or two—I don't mind.”
of his trousers. Dinan stooped down at the other
side of the table and stabbed the dog in the rear
with a fork. With a yelp it started for a quieter
spot. It met Mrs. Graham in the passage bring-
ing in the doughboys, and the lady was consider-
ably upset by the meeting. The doughboys had to
lie collected with the aid of a broom and a dust-pan.
“Now, look here,” said Graham, when matters
had quietened, “I won’t stand no dogs about
here. I’ll shoot it if I see it again, so y’ best get
rid of it.”
“ He won’t trouble y’ no more, Jimmy,” said
the old man, helping himself to such a plateful of
meat and potatoes that Graham fairly gasped.
“Boys,” said Graham, after a while; “our
friend claims to be me ole man. He ain’t
much to be 'proud of, but if he proves his identity
I’ll do me dooty as a son should.” This sentiment
met with the approval of all.
After dinner Graham, assisted by the boarders,
examined the claimant’s papers. Graham was
quite touched as he gazed on a faded picture of
himself in knickers holding his mother’s hand.
“ Aint y’ got no likeness of y’self when y’ left

us?” asked Graham. “I c’ud recognise y’better
from that.”
“I chucked it away long ago, Jimmy. I
placed no value on me own picter ; but I would’nt
part with that there fir th’ world, though y’
mother did turn against me.”
He wept at the recollection.
“Well, what’s the verdick?” asked Graham.
“ Th’ evidence seems in his favor, doesn’t it ?”
“He’s y’r father, right enough,” said Dinan.
“ The resemblance is most remarkable.”
“ No doubt about it,” said the others.
Graham scratched his head. He did not seem
overjoyed at the re-union.
“All right,” he said, at last. “Consider this
y’ home, father. It’s the best I can do f’r ye.”
“Me son, me own Jimmy,” exclaimed the old
man, rushing at Graham with open arms ; but
Graham dodged away. “Go an’ wash y’self,” he
said.
* * * *
The Grahams were none the happier for
the coming of a father. In fact, they became
ashamed of the old man. He would not conform
to the customs
of home life.
Cleanliness
was not his
strong point.
He would not
even sleep re-
gularly in a
bed; and, as
for work, he’d
have none of
it. He cadged
tobacco an d
beer m oney
from all and
sundry. Also,
he would
shoulder his
swag in the
morning and
set off to
“bum” the
district, which
brought Gra-
ham into
discredit,
but he never
failed to i-e-
turn at sun-
down, and take his
place at table.
Graham was dis-
gusted. He cursed
the Rev. M’Phad-
rick, whom he held
responsible for the affair, and swore to get rid of
his aged parent by some means, fair or otherwise.
Matters had gone on like this for a fortnight,
when the parson happened afpner and stayed for
dinner.
“So you found your father, Mr. Graham. Ah !
I knew our prayers would be answered,” lie
remarked. “ But, where is he ? He should have
an honored place at the table. ”
“Oh, he’s out in th’ back, havin’ his tucker in
the yard to-day. Wish I’d never seen th’ ole
nuisance.”^
“Hush! He is your father. You should
respect
“Respect! Why, he’s made me th' laughin’-
stock of th’ place. I’ll send him on th’ track
again, father or not! ”
“Shocking,” said the good man. “I must see
what I can do. Maybe”
“Ye can have him f’r good,” said Graham,
rudely. “ I’ll make ye a present of him.
Later, they went out to see the elder Graham,
He was lying with his dog in the sun, killing
flies. _ , . , ,
“Look at him,” said Graham, bitterly.
M'Phadrick looked, also he laughed. He,
he, he,” he cackled.
Graham never knew him to laugh before.
“What’s, the joke ? ” he asked.
“ So that’s your father.” „
“So he says. I don’t see nothing to laugh at,
growled Graham.
“ Dunphy,” called the minister, “ come here.”
The old man got up, and faced them, looking
surprised.
“ So you’re Mr. Graham’s father, are you ? ”
“lam, parson; you’re right. Jimmy’s my
on’y son.”
“ Why, you old fraud, haven’t I known you for
years as Dave Dunphy ? Don’t I know all about
you ? ”
“Me real name’s Graham,” said the derelict,
eloquently. “ F’r reasons of me own I never used
it. Jist go inside. I’ll get me papers an’ prove
I’m telling the truth.”
They went inside and waited for Davey, but he
was a long time coming, so Graham went to look
for him. He saw a fleeing speck on the horizon
and the dog in hot pursuit.
“Let him go,” said McPhadrick. “He’s no
more your father than I am. The old impostor
has stolen those papers from someone. You should
have taken them from him.”
“He can have ’em,” said Graham. “ Thank the
Lord, I’m rid of him. I’ll have no more fathers
aliout here.”
“Ah, say not so,” said the minister. “If the
real parent comes to you I trust you will receive
him gladly.”
“I’ll gladly receive ’im with a brick,” said
Graham.
* * * *
A couple of weeks passed, and Graham heard no
more of his missing parent and rejoiced. Then
one day Mr. McPhadrick drove up, bringing a
stranger. He alighted and brought his companion
into the house. He was a small, thin, elderly man,
with a white moustache, and wearing colored
glasses. He was shabbily though neatly dressed.
“Rejoice with me,” said the minister to
Graham, “for I have found the sheep that was
lost. Happy am Ito have been the means of re-
turning the strayed one to the fold—to have re-
united father and son.”
“ What’s up now ? ” shrieked Graham.
“ This gentleman is your father,”
“James, my son, do not disown me. lam
indeed your parent,” put in the old gentleman.
“It won’t wash,” said Graham. “Once bit, y’
know, parson. I ain’t talcin’ on no more fathers
jist now.”
“But this is no impostor. Robbed by that
scoundrel whilst coming to you, and deprived of the
meansof proving his identity,, he gave up the idea
of proceeding further, but, by a lucky accident, he
again met the man who had robbed him, and re-
covered his property. Hearing of my connection
with the matter, he came to me for help and
advice. I am satisfied that he is William
Graham. Take him to your arms and comfort
his declining years.” M’Phadrick spoke feel-
ingly.
“’Tis little I ask of you,., James,” said the
claimant—“ a son’s affection, and a humble home
in my old age. Do not spurn me.”
“W®h> if y’ can satisfy me y’r ole Graham,
allright; but I ain’t goin’ t’r be took down again,
if I knows it,” said Graham.
Once again a committee of the boarders con-
sidered the papers, and though they were exactly
the same papers, they again pronounced the
claimant to be the real genuine parent of James
Graham. The parson went his way happy.
Graham found his new parent a weariness.
True, ’he behaved himself like a gentleman—
which puzzled Graham, for he remembered
how his original parent conducted himself.
This ' old gentleman said grace at meals,
imparted religious instruction to the young
Grahams, and continually read his Bible. All
this was oppressive, for Graham did not like too
much religion. The old gentleman was lazy, and
like his predecessor, owned a very large appe-
tite.
The monthly pay at the railway job came round.
Graham had two drays and a scoop working, so
he had a fair cheque to draw. Then there was
the eight boarders’ month’s board money. They
were in the habit of making Graham their banker,
giving him the bulk of their month’s wages for
safe keeping. Altogether this pay-night Graham
had a large sum in his care.
“What a glorious thing it is to have the con-
fidence of one’s fellow-men !” remarked the mild
new parent when he saw the boarders’ cash.
“Yes, they know it’s safe with me, an’ if they
didn’t give it t’r me, Tracey over at the pub ’ud get
th’ lot.”
“ Y’ surely want a very safe place to keep it in,
James.”
“ Oh, I ain’t afraid of burglars. I jist puts it in
a bag an’ shoves it up the chimney,” said Graham.
’Twas late that Saturday night ere all at
Graham’s slept, and it was late on Sunday morn-
ing when Graham awoke and got up.
He thought of his money and went to see if it
was safe. The hiding-place was empty.
Horror-stricken, he aroused the household. No
one was missing except the new father.
In a moment the place was a pandemonium.
The boarders cursed Graham; Graham cursed
everybody and everything. “Get the mare in
an’ put her in the buggy,” he yelled to the family.
“ I’ll chase him.”
He ran from the house and made for the lock-
up to tell the police. Returning, he found
M'Phadrick alighting at his front door. He
always came the Sunday after pay-day.
“Don’t you go in there,” cried Graham.
“Never show y’r nose in my place again, or I'll
murder ye.” ■*'
“What ever is the matter?” said the minister.
“ Robbery ! That’s what’s the matter ; and it’s
all through you, yer miserable, psalm ”
“ Ssh, be calm, my dear sir, and”
“Calm ! Get out, I say, or y’ll get hurt. Y’
bring a Holy Joe cove along an’ sez it’s me father,
an’ he robs me of eighty quid. It’s my belief y’r
in it with him, ye” But the parson was
away down the road, making for the adjacent
town of Grinanbearit at a gallop.
Graham rushed through the house. “Got th’
buggy ready yet?” he shouted. “What th’
devil er y’ all doin’ ! ” He ran down the paddock
to hurry up the boy with the mare. At the slip-
rails he met an old swagman coming towards the
house.
“ Watcher after ?” shrieked Graham.
“ I want t’r see Mister*Graham.”
“ That’s me.”
“Jimmy—me long-lost boy ! ” cried the old
man. " Don’t y’r know y’r pore ole father ? ”
“What, another?” yelled Graham. “I never
had no father.”
“Jim ” began the ancient.
“By God, it’s red hot, “I’ll” Graham
rushed back to the house.
“Mother,” he roared, “here’s another father.
Where’s the gun ? ”
The astonished swagman saw him coming with
his gun, and did not linger. As fast as his old
legs would carry him he ran. It was not Graham’s
fault that the gun was not loaded.
Though ’twas Sunday the latest claimant to the
parentage of Graham gained admission to the
“ Tanksinkers’ Arms.” The place was full.
“ Brandy, quick,” wheezed the ancient one.
“What’s up, Dad?” said Tracey. “Ye look
bad.”
“Oh, my!” gasped the traveller. “I’ve bin
nearly shot.”
“Who by?”
“Me own son, Jim Graham. I told him I was
his father, an’ ”
His remarks were drowned in a chorus of rude
laughter.
“ Astonishin’,” said Tracey, “the number of
fathers Graham seems to have.”
' r * t * *
M’Phadrick was returning from Grinanbearit.
He did not stop the night, as was his wont, at
Brulong, but pushed on to Narebna.
A few miles out of Brulong he came across an
old man sitting on his swag groaning.
The minister pulled up and alighted.
“ What’s the matter, my man?” he asked.
“I’m about done for, Mister. I’ve bin bad for
a long time, an’ to-day’s about finished me. Some-
thing gone wrong inside er me.”
Mr. M’Phadrick got him with difficulty into
the buggy. “I’ll take you into town to the
doctor,” he said, kindly.
On the road the old man talked with difficulty.
“Me name’s Graham,” he said. “Me son adver-
tised fir me. I starts out t’r come to him. On
the way I meets an ole mate, Dave Dunphy. I
gets drunk an’ locked up. He steals all me
papers. They give me a month fir riotous con-
duct. When I come out I had to go into th’
’orspital. I come out last week, an’ come down
t’r find me son. I see him this niornin’, an’ he
chases me with a gun. So that’s the end of me
dream of home. I’m willin’ t’r die now. But
I’ll pay him out afore I go.”
M’Phadrick acted the man. He took the
patient home and put him to bed, and got the
doctor at once.
“No hope,” was the verdict; “he’s a complete
wreak.”
The minister sat up with him, and endeavored
to smooth the way.
He asked for pen and paper. “I want ter
make me will,” he said.
To humor him, the materials were brought and
the Rev. M’Phadrick drew up a will at his
dictation :
I give and bequeath all money lying to my credit in the
Savings Bank of Noo South Wales to the Rev. Donald
M’Phadrick, of Narebna.
He signed this with difficulty in the presence
of two witnesses.
“ There y’ are,” hesaid, “I’ve never gone much
on parsons, but you ain’t a bad sort. It was all
fir Jimmy, but he’s fell in. He thought I was a
beggar, I suppose. Y’ll find the bank-book in
me swag.”
Soon after he passed away. His last words
were, “ How’s it fir er ’bacca ? ”
Thd book was found and revealed to the Rev.
Donald that he had fallen in for £250. “ A kindly
act never goes unrewarded,” he observed.
Graham would not attend the funeral. He said
he would have nothing “to do with any more
fathers.
Shortly after he got this short note from Mr.
M’Phadrick
Dear Brother,—l am leaving the district, perhaps never
to return ; but before going I wish to convey my heart-
felt regret that through my endeavors to find vour
father-I have caused you to beJinposecTupon and robbed.
I am but a poor man, yet would I beg of you to accept
the enclosed £lO as a small solatium for your loss.
Donald M’Phadrick.
“Well,” said Graham, “he ain’t a bad sort,
after all.”
Later he learned the whole truth, and he shot
two dogs and fought one of his best boarders to a
finish before his fury was appeased.

THE AFFAIR AT THE PICNIC.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A RECENT disappointment in love had
made Benno a perfect fiend to women.
A woman had deceived him ; by her
perfidy his heart had been broken, his life
blighted. At 21| he was already embittered, and
all through a woman. Henceforward he would
give them no quarter. His cynicism would make
you shudder.
“I’m livin’ on’y fer revenge,” he told Feathers,
darkly.
“Come orf ther keg, little boy,” replied the
packer, with his man-of-the-world air. “You
ain’t talkin’, y’ know; yer just makin’ a noise.”
“I’m talkin’ gorstrutli,” the clerk continued.
“ There isn’t a bit o’ common in treatin’ women
decent. If y’ do they’ll dog on yer fer a cert.
Deal ’em out stoush hard ’n’ often, ’n’ they’ll lick
yer ’and. Show ’em yer gone soft about ’em, ’n’
y’ get what yer lookin’ fer—ther sudden jerk.
Yer on’y fit t’ be cut up fer dusters then.
Women’s pure nark, I tell yer. I spared one
woman once” (here the little clerk’s voice became
husky and morose, and his small brow darkened),
“’n’ she never forgive me fer it, but never again—
never again. Any iv the sect what’s in my power
after this won’t git no mercy, ’n’ that’s how it is.”
“It’s fur ’avin’ sixpen’orth iv ’ang-over et ‘Ther
Cankered ’Eirt, ’r Ther Cooper in ther Soup,’ ’n’
it’s puttin’ up
fer a ’eavy vil-
lain et eight
stone seven,”
Feathers com-
mented ; and
then he con-
tinued in a
declamatory
manner: “T”
mothers ’iv
fam’lies, ’n’ all
whom it may
concern. A s
Benno, the
feather-weight
devil, other-
wise ther Mer-
ciless Midget,
isnowprowlin
at large in ther
parks ’n’ waste
places, it
would be well
’n’ wise t’ keep
all girls iv ther
female sex un-
der 16 stone
limit on ther
chain till ther
monster’s plugged with bullets ’r otherwise
pervided fer.”
“You’re ther king comic, ain’t yer?” sneered
Benno. “ Better mind out ’r yer’ll be makin’ me
larf. Er man might’s well tork sense to er mad-
house cockertoo.”
The clerk returned to his high stool in a huff,
but he was back at Feathers in the course of an
hour as if nothing had happened, with an elabora-
tion of his complaint, and the theme was staling
on Mills. In fact, the whole factory was losing faith
in Mr. Dickson in the character of a destroyer,
although the Beauties still considered it worth
while to affect a grotesque timidity when he ap-
proached them.
“ Oh, ’eavens ! Take them eyesaway,” cried the
ex-professional fat girl, retreating behind her
board. “ Have pity on the orfin girl ! ”
Back, wretch ! hissed Sarah Eddie, arming
herself with a paste brush. “ I’m on’y a lone
woman, pa’s in the country, ’n’ ma’s gone fishin’,
but if you touch me I’ll scream.”
Selina Dodd (“Silby” in the vernacular), who
was camel-like m her proportions, and, according
to heathers, “as plain as a hide pie,” elevated
herself almost out of sight of the attenuated clerk,
cWI (7 iriu^ from a popular melodrama :
Think, man, think ! Would you stain your
soul with this hidjis sin ? Remember, you had a
mother once.”
Ar-r-r, get it stopped ! ” retorted Benno with
awful vindictiveness. Or perhaps he said : “So
y ort to, or “Git yer ’ead read,’’ or something
equally felicitous. Benno was never wanting in
telling repartee. But neither the burlesque of the
Beauties, the derision of Feathers, nor the irony
of the town traveller affected Benno’s attitude.
He loved himself as the soured victim of the per-
fidious sex, relentless in his anguish, justified in
all his iniquities by the faithlessness and villainy
of woman.
For some time past he had been hinting to
Mills and Goudy, and even to the depressed fore-
man—the only person in the whole establishment
who took him seriously—that he had found a
victim. His hints were dark, but significant, and
he smiled a mirthless smile.
“ Lead ’em on, an’ when yer got ’em fair dilly
about yer, freeze ’em ; that’s my motto,” he told
Goudy.
“Thanks be, my doors are shut to you,”
answered the town traveller. “A. man with
maiden aunts of his own can’t be too careful.”
“ Out with it, Benno, who’s yer cuddle?” said
Feathers.
“There’s ’ere an’there one,” Benno admitted
wearily, “ but ther little hextra special’s a bit iv a
widder Kingy’s interjuced to me.”
“A widow,” murmured Goudy, and he laid a
large, hot, fatherly hand on Benno’s head, and
sighed three times, “a poor, little, bereaved,
helpless, artless, innocent widow, and you a man
of the world, a callous, sin-stained devil! Ah, this
is indeed a hard world for women.”
“ Good enough for ’er,” Benno scowled darkly.
“But all the same your mother ought to be
warned,” concluded Goudy.
“Is she er shine squeeze, Benno?” asked
Feathers.
“Such ez they are,” replied Benno, without
warmth. “They’re all erlilte t’ me. But I’m
thinkin’ o’ havin’ it on my string fer ther picnic
so y’ wanter watch out.”
* * * *
The packer had no conscience, and respected
nobody’s confidence if his ruffianly sense of
humor suggested that food for laughter was to be
gained by violating it. And yet the packer never
laughed. He went to the Beauties with the story
of Benno’s little widow, and inspired a systematic
pulling of Benno’s leg, and was happy through a
whole week while the clerk cynically enlarged on
the widow’s great, despairing affection for him,
and gave everybody to understand that he could
twist her round his finger, but her love awakened
no reciprocal emotions in his case-hardened
breast. He was a man with a past. “Women’s
bin me rooin,” he told the foreman, surveying the
wreck in the mirror on Ellis’s wall with a good
deal of interest and adjusting his tie, “’n’l’ve
got it up agen ’em till my dyin’ day.”
“My advice,” said Fuzzy earnestly and in
almost a whisper, “is, do notliink rash.”
Benno laughed his new, mirthless laugh, and
walked away.
“Gor’delpus orl! ” cried slatternly Arabella
Harte—called ‘ ‘ Harrerbeller ” —hearing the laugh,
and the fat girl crossed herself.
The factory went to its picnic in vehicles of
nine kinds, and, passing through the city, looked
like a bush funeral gone astray; but it did not
sound anything like that. It was a peculiarly
blatant procession, and for the most part sang
touching vaudeville ballads about “mother” or
somebody’s “ broken heart,” each vehicle exer-
cising its liberty of choice, and striving to out-sing
the other. Those excursionists who did not sing
cast reflections on the habits, manners, and per-
sonal appearance of respectable pedestrians carry-
ing small black bags to business. Their astonish-
ment and indignation under the ordeal were con-
sidered most diverting.
The appearance of Benno’s little widow before
the loading-up occasioned something like a sensa-
tion. She proved to be a tall, stout, hilarious
woman of about 30, with ruddy cheeks, black
hair, and a large, dark, cheerfully defiant eye.
She was of the stamp our fathers classified as
“ bouncing.”
“Mother of Jimmy! Is that the victim of
Benno’s guile?” gasped Goudy.
“ It’s it orlright,” answered Feathers. “ Don’t
she look it t’ ther life ? She’s ther one little ewe
lamb bein’ led t’ ther slaughter.”
Then Benno passed the lady round. “ Let me
interjuce yous,” he said. “ These is Mr. Goudy
’n’ Mr. Mills, ’n’ this is Mrs. Norah Cavanagh,
one o’ mine.”
ON HIS MAJESTY'S IRONCLAD.
PROSECUTOR (who has reported his mate for using
bad language): “And I arx you, sir, ’ow
would you like to be called a fool, sup-
posing as ’ow you wasn’t one! ”
Feathers could hold his face; he winked the
lady hard in the eye, and stood his ground ; but
the town traveller retired precipitately behind the
delivery waggon, and bit himself.
“What use ’ave yer got fer him, Norah?”
asked the packer, familiarly.
“Oh, I don’t let him get in me way,” replied
the widow.
Then Benno introduced Nicholas Don, and
Nicholas immediately entered into possession.
The Don was employed as carter at 3Gs. per week.
He told Mrs. Cavanagh, immediately and con-
fidentially, that he was taking the odds on his
being made junior partner within a year.
“ If you are out for a good gay day,” he said,
“ place - your order with me. Don’t pay for it all,
of course—a fellow can’t do everything with a
paltry AlO a week—but I’m spinning a few jim
over it, and what’s mine’s yours.”
The Don was reported to have a way with
women. His “way” was a system of cheerful
and audacious mendacity, and was uniformly suc-
cessful for a time. In ordinary circumstances,
his conversation was in the vernacular, but, when
impressing a lady, he fell into a fairly accurate
STEADILY EMERGING.
“ She’s been out about seven or eight seasons.”
“ Docs she come out further the longer she’s out?”
. . . ,
imitation of the barbarous accent of the Fuglish
i ll l 6 bu r l°sques. .
JNicholas sat next to Mrs. Cavanagh during the
ride out, and monopolised her. Benno sat on the
other side of the widow, rond was prey to a grievous
uneasiness, m strong contrast with his previous
attitude as the cold, proud avenger. His uneasi-
n.ess w '!: s occasioned by the carter s frank repudia-
tion of his right, title and interest in Mrs.
Cavanagh, and by a painful suspicion that
Don had his arm round Norali from the off
r e * ike suspicion was unworthy, but well-
founded. Benno strove, to maintain an air of
proprietorship, but Ins efforts to keep a place in
the conversation were quietly ignored.
Ihe picnic ground was at Dogwood, where there
was a sprinkling of gums along the river, and a
nice belt of ti-tree scrub offering cover for affec-
tionate couples between meals. Nicholas Don
remained in possession of Benno’s widow, and the
clerk prowled after the pair all the morning,
making occasional protestations with an attempt
at humor that became pitiful through repetition.
Norah could not be brought to understand that
she owed allegiance to Benno, who had introduced
her to such a stlect gathering and paid her way, and
Don had no sense of honor. The moment Benno
withdrew his surveillance the pair disappeared,
and then Benjamin Dickson went trotting from
cover to cover, making inquiries, the affectedly
comic nature of which did not disguise his great
distress, and meeting everywhere with the bit-
terest contempt. Benno threatened to be the
ruin of the picnic.
Discovering Nicholas and Norah for the second
time since dinner, Benno abandoned facetiae.
“ Strike me up a stick,” he said, bitterly, “ this
is gettin’ on my nerves. Say, what brought yer
to this corrob—me or his nibs ? ”
“Go on along and mind baby. Mummy’s
busy,” replied Norah.
“Don’t I like yer pink cheek, polin’ in on ’er
bloke’s ticket, an’ then doin’ the smoodge with his
cobber.” Benno was deeply hurt. “’Taint the
act iv a lady,” he added virtuously. He was so
sure of this point of etiquette that he repeated it
five times.
“Yar-r, go away, carn’t yer !” snorted
Nicholas, “an’send in yer bill. Get somethin’
o’ yer own. I got a reserve on this.”
“Somethin’ o’me own!” Benno fairly gasped,
“I like that, I don’t think.” He seated himself
deliberately on the grass at their leet. “ Some-
thin’ p’ me own ! ” he repeated.
Nicholas Don resigned himself to the situation,
He pillowed Norah’s head on his shoulder, he
addressed to the widow words of tenderness and
sighs of ardor, he kissed her at intervals, and
Benno, the miserable, sat and looked on, and de-
nounced them occasionally in his own inimitable
wa y #
“Yer needn’t mind me,” he said, “I’m ther
hearse. I’m s’posed to be dead. All the same,
it’s daylight dam robbery, iv yer arsk me.”
“Don’t erpologise,” answered Nicholas.
They tried to shake Benno off later, but Benno
refused to be shaken. He yapped at their heels
like a disagreeable little dog, following them
every where, and voices out of ambush cried deri-
siveljt after the three as they drifted from place to
place. Despairing of ridding themselves of him,
Nicholas and the widow returned to the camping
ground on the river bank, where a number of the
Beauties and their boys were varying honest
Pagan dalliance with another meal. Norah
seated herself, and Don provided “’am san’-
wiches ” and picnic tea. Benno stood over them
while they ate, glowering darkly. He had no
appetite. That was another injustice. He medi-
tated an appeal to common decency and popular
opinion, and, meanwhile, raked the perfidious
pair with scathing invective; but they ate, drank
and were merry. - •
“ Don’t’ave’im on yer mind,” said Nicholas;
“ he ain’t on the earth.”
“But yer gotter,” piped Benno. “I’m 'ere t’
live. You don’t shake me. Get on to it, blokes,”
he cried in shrill tones. “ Ain’t it dead hooketty ?
Here’s me bin ’n’ parted ther beans t’ bring a
tom along, ’n’ ther Don backs his barrer ’n’
/
burgles her. He’s too dirt mean to finance a skirt
uv ’is own, ’n’ ”
Benno’s first public oration ended there. He
was standing on the rug on which Norah was
seated, with his back to the river. The widow’s
hand gripped the rug. She gave it a sharp tug.
Benno’s boots shot out. He sat down. The bank
was steep there. Benno struck it halfway down,
ricochetted smartly, and shot into the river, feet
first. There was an instantaneous rush of pic-
nickers as Benno went down. There was a
unanimous roar of advice as Benno came up.
Benno disregarded it. He was clawing
like a desperate cat with a weight on her
tail. His eyes were wild. He opened
his mouth and the river ran in. Benno
went under once more. Nicholas Don
was waiting for him with a hooked
stick when here-appeared. The stick
was hitched in the back of Benno’s
coat, and Nicholas hauled the half-
drowned clerk on to the bank, and
left him there. When Dickson
recovered sufficiently to manifest
an interest in mundane things,
Nicholas and the widow had dis-
appeared.
* * *
Deserted, deluded, sodden, Ben
Dickson bore with the heartless
barracking of the Beauties and
their boys for ten minutes, and then
turned his back on womankind and
fled into .the scrub. He went far
beyond the range of the smoodgers,
seeking the solace of solitude. In
the depths he lit a fire, and, having
stripped, 'hung his dripping gar-
ments to dry, and then laydown
in the shade, and, like a desolate
babe in the woods, covered himself
with leaves, and gave his mind to
despairing reflections upon the per-
fidy, selfishness, and deceit of the
race of men—especially women,
lie was awakened by an unpleasant
sensation of frying, which attacked
his feet, and sprang up with a yell.
The scrub was afire. The day had
been extremely hot, there was a
strong north wind, and the scrub
burnt fiercely. Benno’s only chance
was in instantaneous flight. He
Hed—fled as he was—rushing,
diving, tearing and tumbling
through the bush, an image of
supreme alarm, with the fire spring-
ing at his heels, licking out whips
of flame to lash him along.
The fire swept through the scrub,
and drove all the smoodgers into
the open, Nicholas Don and Norah
Cavanagh with the rest. Blame
attached to Benno. The firing of the scrub was
supposed to be an act of malicious retaliation,
and the picnic cursed him.
At half-past five, When tea was spread, there was
no Benno to appreciate the little acts of vengeance
that they were saving for him. An hour later,
when the vans were loaded for the home journey,
there was still no Benno. Goudy, with the faintest
suggestion of concern, advised a search of the
burnt area. The men went to the hunt with some
ferocity, cursing Benno. They returned two hours
later, walking like a funeral procession. Feathers
had portion of a hat and part of a boot, recognis-
able as belonging to the deceased Benjamin
Dickson. Nicholas Don carried some bones, not
recognisable as those of the deceased B. Dickson,
nut reasonably supposed to be his. The Beauties
were overwhelmed, and consternation fell upon
the picnic. The widow uttered cries of bitterest
self-reproach, and, giving way to tears, reviled
Nicholas Don for his cruelty and faithlessness to
his poor dead friend. That would have been a
proud moment for Benno had he only lived to
witness the complete revulsion of feeling in his
favor.
Some of the men remained to continue the hunt,
and the bones and the other relics were handed
over to the police at Dogwood, with details. There
was no singing of ribald songs as Spats’ picnic
drove into town that night. Gloom was seated in
every vehicle. The Beauties discussed Benno’s
perfections in low, reverent voices. The widow
was a pariah. Nicholas'Don’s unpopularity was
absolute.
Next day there was the same gloom in the fac-
tory. Benno’s deserted desk was a silent reproach
to all who had aided and abetted Don in his act
of treachery. The evening paper contained a
full and not over-particular account of the sup-
posed terrible death of a young clerk, but the
papers of the following morning prepared the
Beauties for the reappearance of Benno.
He was pale and singed, and he sat with great
apparent discomfort, but he had rather a jaunty
air, for he was now a person of some notoriety,
and his race for life had been given quite a heroic
aspect in the press.
Feathers, who had stayed at Dogwood to assist
the police, explained the denouement.
“Seems ’is nibs there done a quarter mile in
ten secs, under the hofficial record, with ther fire
proddin’ him all ther way, ’n’ come out on ther
west side, alone in a crool world. Then he
reeorlected with a holler groan that in ther ’urry
iv shiftin’ he’d clean fergot his glad rags, ’n’ was
ixposed to ther hinclemency iv ther weather ’n’
ther dangers iv ther law ’orribly undressed, ’n’
fearin’ t’ be caught in ther act he went t’ roost in
a ’oiler tree. He stayed there all night. In ther
mornin’ there was nothin’ better fer a man t’ do,
mqther naked ’n’ ten miles from ’ome, so he
returned to his ’oiler, ’specially as another picnic
party rushed ’im outer sight, ’n’ then camped in his
back-yard. A yeller dog traced him there in ther
afternoon, ’n’ me ’n’ a John discovered ther plant,
just when some boys was goin’ t’ light a fire t’
out somethin’ or another—they didn’t care
which. We made er collection from ther picnic,
’n’i presented Benno with a stror lid, a pink tie, a
flannel petticut, four handkerchiefs, ’n’ a donah’s
bob-tailed coat, ’n’ I delivered him at his ’ome
larst night, fie was blistered, ’n’ singed, ’n’
smoked, ’n’ scratched all over, ’n’ ther ants had
got at him, otherwise he’s free iv himpedfiments
’n’ in good repair, ’n’ he’s thinkin’ iv applyin’ fer
ther Rile Humane Society’s medal for distin-
guished bravery in savin’ his own life, ain’t yer,
Benno?” .....
“ Better he had died,” said Goudy impressively ;
“better have perished in the flames than. Jive to
continue his pitiless career among innocent and
confiding widows.”
“ Pah ! who let that in ?” said Benno with con-
tempt. “ I ortenter talk t’ your sort.”
Just then the whistle blew, and a voice from the
depths said very distinctly :
“There’s a gentleman from the press here to
interview our Mr. Dickson.”
The call was timely. The celebrity took a lapel
of his coat in either hand, gave a little, charac-
teristic, saucy tug, squared liis small shoulders,
and went down stairs a cold, proud man.
“ Fer photographs ’n full perticklers, see our
later editions,” said the packer.

The Cafe Ichabod.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
nnHERE is a street some few men know,
That is to other men unseen ;
The grass in it is growing green,
And shadows walk there, to and fro.
In that old street, once brisk and gay,
Whose pavement now is seldom trod,
There stands the Cafe Ichabod,
With dim eyes blinking at the day.
Its ancient guests are dead and gone ;
It has grown old by slow degrees,
And now is buried to its knees
In ashes of Oblivion.
One autumn eve, ere lamps were lit,
When Magic reigned on land and sea,
I sought that ancient hostelry,
And in the dusk discovered it.
But ah, the change ! Was this grim den,
With peeling walls and creaking floor,
The place that rang in days of yore
With laughter of red-blooded men ?
There was no welcome at the door
That opened once on noble cheer,
And under the great chandelier
The tall-stemmed glasses gleamed no more.
Where were the glasses? Where the fair,
Fine-figured damask cloths so white
That made the tables exquisite ?
Alas, they were no longer there.
Bright pictures once the walls did grace—
Bluff hunting-men in scarlet coats,
And spotted hounds with baying throats.
And all the glory of the chase.
All, all had gone. Where mirth had reigned
There never now was song or toast,
But like an old bald-headed ghost
The waiter William still remained.
He glided softly round the place ;
His coat that was so black had grown
As green as moss upon a stone,
And like a fiddle was his face.
I sat beneath a gas-jet dim
And ate a dinner wan and weird ;
Ate cheese with a blue-mouldy beard,
And Dead Sea soup and mutton grim.
I asked what there might be to drink,
“Claret,” said William in reply.
The baleful glitter in his eye,
It should have made me stop to think.
What matter? I went there to drain
A glass to memories of old.
To dead men lying in the mould.
To days that ne’er would come again.
Then suddenly, as at the call
Of some magician strange I saw
(It was the wine, no doubt) with awe.
A row of hats along the wall.
Silk hats they were ; good hats, but yet
The ghosts of hats of days gone by ;
I knew them all, and knew that I
Was at a Dead Men’s Dinner set.
They came with shoes of silence shod ;
I tried to hear their talk, in vain,
But yet I knew that once again
They filled the Cafe Ichabod.
’Tis in a street that few men know,
A street by many men unseen ;
The grass in it is growing green,
That strange old street of Long Ago.

A Song of the Hills.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LOWING noon on spire and steeple—
• I Never boon of shadow spun
O’er the parched ways for the people
In this City of the Sun.
Through the glaring day I sicken for the purple
on the ‘Hills—
For the storm-light on the peaks,
When the mighty thunder speaks,
And the tearing torrents quicken in the wide
womb of the Hills.
Is it strife for place or plunder ?
Or the glory of the quest ?
When the weaklings stumble under,
Shall I fall among the rest ?
And I reel amid the riot of the never-resting mills,
Where the ground and garnered grains
Are the spoil of human brains,
Till I hunger for the quiet of the strong and silent
Hills.
From the crowd’s incessant motion,
And the feud twixt faith .and creed,
Oh, for some magician’s potion,
Like the ancient charms we read,
That might bear me from men’s babble to the
cloister of the Hills,
Like pale friars grouped around
Keeping guard on holy ground,
Where the stooping branches dabble in the cold
lakes of the Hills !
Old Tuhua’s grey form ending
Where the lake and mountain meet,
Like Achilles, stern, unbending,
With dead Hector at his feet.
Are there smouldering desires in the sounds on
Stoic Hills ?
Hidden craters in the deeps
Of their chill and frozen steeps—
Are there wells of molten lava in the shut hearts
of the Hills ?
And I feel the undulating
Of a chord invisible—
All my spirit palpitating
Like the music of a bell.
And I may not stay nor falter, for it draws me
where it wills :
’Tis the wand the Magi wield
O'er their white and icy field,
From a dim untapered altar in the circle of the
Hills.

A JOURNALIST
AN D TW O BEARS
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT has been observed by same philoso-
pher in the heavy-weight division, that for
every effect there is a cause, and if we only
seek for it with sufficient energy it will be found.
The fearsome row that happened one night out in
St. Kilda had two causes. One was the unsuc-
cessful attempt of William Johnson to dissolve
Parliament; the other was the unfeeling conduct
of the Hon. Samuel Bloggs, M.L.C., in seizing
the boa-constrictor for back rent.
Johnson was, in his time, almost the most cele-
brated pressman in Australia. He was a brilliant
man, and he had been drunk on every paper of
importance in every Australian city. He was so
brilliant when sober that even the editor in whose
premises he had had his most picturesque and
devastating drunk would be found, a couple of
years later, holding up a large bowl-like ear that
Johnson might pour into it a plausible assurance
that he was a changed inhabitant, that the flowing
bottle had lost all attractions for him, and that he
had learned to shudder at the very mention of
lager beer. There was only one editor who never
gave Johnson a second hearing, and as Johnson
had shoved his head through the window this
wasn’t remarkable.
It was a hot and dreadful day when Johnson
tried to dissolve Parliament. He was in the press
gallery of the Upper House, making a hierogly-
phic now and then and dozing between times, and
his insobriety was considerable. Things were
ineffably dreary. The Hon. Bildad Smith was
pouring obscurity on the provisions of the Bill for
Eradicating Surplus Population, and the House
longed to get away and be at rest. The Bill for
Eradicating Surplus Population died a natural
death about 4 p.m. Someonesuggested the second
reading of the Bill for the Encouragement of
Large Estates. Someone else, who felt too ex-
hausted to live any longer, proposed that the
House should leave off for the day. and the words
fell dimly on the ear of Johnson in the press gal-
lery, like the sound of running waters in a dry
land, and made him leap to his feet. In his fear
lest the motion should be lost he poured his notes,
and his pencil, and another pressman’s hat on the
bald head of a member sitting below, and waved
his arms like a tree m a gale, and spoke -
“I proposh,” he said, thickly, “that thish
House adjournsli for ever. Proposh that it never
meetsh again. Mister Shpeaker”—he spoke
appealingly—“why not chuck it upsh?”—he
threw up his hands to illustrate the chucking pro-
cess. “You knowsli you’re a lot of uselessh old
fossilsh. You knowsh yer no good—no good ’tall.
You knowsh yer no dashed goodsh. Why not ”
he spoke persuasively—“why not chuck it right
upsh?” He threw up his hands again to show
how high he wanted it chucked and upset an
inkpot, which drained gently on to a member
below. “Lesh be honesht an’ close the whole
show, and go out peaceably an’ have drinksh, an’
give it up as a bad jobsh, an’ ”
An avalanche fell on Johnson. There was a
rush of infuriated dignitaries up the stairs. There
was a rush down the stairs of Johnson with his
hat over his eye and his arms held by two friendly
journalists. The dignitaries coming up the stairs
were elderly and short-winded, but bitterly hos-
tile. The pressmen coming down the stairs with
Johnson were young, and they were taking three
steps at a bound—they couldn’t help themselves
because Johnson had lost his footing at the top
step, and the dead weight of his tall figure was
dragging them along with him. They didn’t
want to trample on the Sergeant-at-arms, or to
put their feet on the stomach of the door-keeper,
but, once started on their errand of mercy, they
couldn’t help themselves. The Fourth Estate
was in the air when the collision happened, and
it hadn’t even time to shout a warning or say that
it was coming. Johnson had a vague recollection
of being in an earthquake and of storming a city,
and then he found himself in the street.
“Thish,” he said, dreamily, “ish great fun.”
“ It is,” said the man from the evening paper,
grimly. “ I wish I had left it alone. I trod on
the Sergeant-at-arms coming down, and that’ll
take a lot of explaining.”
“Whatsh nexht thing?” said Johnson in a
reverie.
“ The next thing,” said the evening paper man,
“ is for you to get down to your office faster than
you ever ran before, and see if you can get some
money before they hear of this row, for you won’t
get any after that. And then you’d better take
to-night’s boat for Melbourne, and don’t come
back here for two years. No paper in this town
will want you till then, and here’s a policeman
streaming after you already.”
Johnson ran. Looking back as he
turned the corner be saw the legis-
lators pouring out like
bees and gesticulating
wildly on the pavement.
That night a muffled
individual who was com-
paratively sober, but not
q lite sober enough to know
if he were wanted for a capital offence or
not, carefully avoided the gangway of the
steamer and climbed on to the steerage
end by a rope. He gave his name as
something like “Whisli” or “Whoop,”
and he hid himself behind a pile of
fruit cases till the vessel sailed.
In a general way Johnson’s intervals
of sobriety lasted six months, and his
semi-annual “jag” lasted a fortnight.
Therefore there were thirteen months in
his year. The misfortune in this case
was that the “ jag ” had been interrupted
in its third day, and when the retreating
forces of Johnson reached Melbourne in
disorder there were still, in the ordinary
course of events, nine days of the disturbance
to run. He had no plans for taking up the
thread of his interrupted “bust”; he just took
it up, or it took itself up. The proceeding was
assisted by many friends who had heard of his
recent doings and thought they called for re-
cognition.
There was so much recognition that the end of
the first day was a mist with a huge beer pot
looming through it and a gas-light making a
radiance on the pot. Johnson slept somewhere
that night—at least he found himself in an hotel
in the morning. The second day was a fog with a
whiskey bottle looming through it. The second
evening was a thick fog, through which a gigantic
hand —which Johnson surmised was his own
hand—could be seen reaching out for refresh-
ments. Then he was vaguely aware that oblivion
came upon him, but that he didn’t fall down ; he
only set out to walk somewhere.
* * * *
When he awoke he was looking at a bear. It
was very early on a beautiful summer morning,
and Melbourne was still asleep. Johnson found
himself leaning against a lamp-post in Bourke-
street, but he was moderately sober, from which
fact he assumed that he had been walking most of
the night. He studied the bear thoughtfully, and
the bear returned the compliment.
“This,” said the pressman in a dispassionate
tone, “ must be a jim-jam.”
The bear never moved, and Johnson delivered
an address to it.
“You are,” he said, “the firsht bear jim-jam
I’ve seen. I s’pose you’re a jim-jam. If you are,
you’ll preshently become a snake or something.
If you keep on being a bear, then s’pose you
musht be a bear. You sheem to keep on being a
bear. It’sh most remarkable.”
The two Bears roosted on a form.
Something wet licked Johnson’s ear from
behind. He leaped two feet into the air, and
turned round to find another bear. This time he
was angry, and spoke severely.
“ Look here, are you a bear or are you not ? If
you don’t explain inside 60 seconds, I’ll knock
your head off.”
“ Don’t, for heaven’s sake —don’t make that
row, Bill,” said a fretful voice; “ and leave my
property alone.”
Again Johnson leaped into the air. The voice
was familiar, but it seemed to come from nowhere,
and for a second or two he ascribed it to one of
the animals. Then he became aware that he had
fallen on a family of three. A small, discouraged-
looking man was sitting on the edge of the pave-
ment with his feet in the gutter. He had his hat
drawn down over his eyes and his coat-collar
dragged up about his ears, and his hands were
buried in his pockets. It was Silver, spasmodic
pressman—mostly of the free-lance variety—
unsaleable poet, occasional showman, theatrical
manager and-lecturer, an irregular drinker and a
Bohemian of shifts and expedients. Also, an old
friend.
“ Leave ’em alone,” he said gloomily. “ I hate
people fooling with my bears.”
Johnson shook Silver’s hand cordially when he
had dragged it out of his pocket, and then he also
sat down on the edge of the pavement with his
feet in the gutter. The junior bear came and
licked his ear again,
“ What’s up ? ” Johnson asked brief!y.
“ Have you got a watch on you ? What’s the
time?” demanded the owner of the bears.
Johnson felt for his watch, but it was gone. He
didn’t remember where it had gone to.
“It doesn’t matter,” said the gloomy little man
sinking deeper into his coat. “ 1 only wanted to
know how long it was till the pawnshops opened
so that I could put the zoological garden up the
spout. Have you got lialf-a-erown ?’’
Johnson again searched himself, and found
nothing.
“You’re a hopeful sort of fellow to meet, I
must say,” almost wailed the small man.
“But what does it all mean ? ’’shouted Johnson.
“ Where d’ye come from last ? What are you wail-
ing about —one would think you were the book of
Jeremiah? And why are you sitting here at four
in the morning with two wild animals ? What’s it
all about ? ”
“Oh, that’s easy enough, The Agegus said it
didn’t want me any more, so I thought I’d take a
turn at lecturing. I got Smith for my agent —
you know Smith ; he drinks—and we went round
the small towns, where I delivered an eloquent
address on ‘The Socialistic Tendencies of the
Period ’ to an average audience of ten.”
“ I met a man who’d heard it,” said Johnson.
“He said it was terrible.”
“We had to throw it up after the fifth lecture.
Then we met Miss Billy Montmorency’s dramatic
company, and I became manager, while Smith
was principal tragedian. They were playing the
kind of drama which makes you wish you were
dead, and. they had one set of scenery.”
“ I’ve heard of Miss Billy,” commented John-
son. “She’s an ingenue of 45 with her hair
down.”
“Well, it was while we were travelling with
her that We struck a patch of real luck at last.
Smith got a chance to buy a lot of goods cheap—
two dancing bears, and a boxing kangaroo, and a
stuffed boa-constrictor. We came back to Mel-
bourne and set up a show in this shop here.”
He jerked his thumb over his shoulder, and
Johnson, following the motion, noticed a small
closed shop covered with bills to the effect that
Smith and Silver’s unrivalled show was within.
“It lasted ten days. We coined money. I
altered my lecture about ‘The Socialistic Tenden-
cies of the Period,” to make it fit in with the
bears, and it took wonderfully. But Smith wasn’t
sober once the whole ten days. He had the
biggest interest in the show, and the way he went
on was terrible. The bears weren’t sober either.
The last two days the boxing kangaroo wasn’t
sober. Smith tried to pour beer into the stuffed
boa-constrictor. Last of all he backed a horse
with the rent and lost. The landlord cleared us
out last night. He took the boa-constrictor for
rent. Smith disappeared round the corner with
the kangaroo, and I and the bears hid behind the
ash-barrel in the back yard most of the night for
fear the police would take away my only asset.
We had just come out for a whiff of fresh air
when you came along. The ash-barrel smelt
something horrible.”
Johnson rose like a man inspired.
‘‘Old man. we’ll rebuild our fortunes. We’ll
establish a new firm. I know a pub. where
my credit’s good for one drink each —we
mustn’t have more than one—and some
sandwiches. I know a kind-hearted green-
grocer who wouldn’t see a fellow-bear go hungry
while he had a pound of stock in the shop. We’ll
make our live stock perform in the streets ; every
copper in Melbourne knows me, and they won't
move ME on. I’ll deliver a brief, impassioned
address on bears —you can’t lecture worth a cent—
while you make the live stock dance and take
round the hat. We’ll explain afterwards that we
did it for a wager of 10,000 dollars with some fool
American. There’s any number of them. I know
an American here who sells pills for remov-
ing large feet; he’ll say he made the bet to adver-
tise his pills. I’ll get £5 from B. Sloman for the
right to paste a bill on the big bear about his
unrivalled ready-made pants at 3s. Gd. We’ll
shake things up, Silver. Whoop ! ”


“Whoop!” said the depressed man in a
whisper.
* * * *
In later years, when Silver had been found
again after his disappearance, and when Johnson
pondered on the mysterious vanishment of wild
animals, their accounts of the one stormy day
of their partnership used to differ. I have heard
both accounts, and it seems to me the root cause
of the trouble was Johnson’s unfinished “jag.”
As already mentioned, that pressman’s semi-
annual drunk was wound up for a fortnight, and
as only seven days had expired, he was a wholly
unreliable person, and not to be trusted with
either money or beer. Silver had no fixed drink-
ing hours or days—he hadn’t even a regular drink-
ing year —but he was a small weak man, and
liable to be led astray by anybody at any time.
They had both had a bad night, and it was fol-
lowed by a hot, exciting day, and things hap-
pened.
At first all went well. The one drink and the
breakfast of sandwiches materialised. The bear
food was procured on credit.
B. Slornan was interviewed as soon as his shop
opened, and though he would only part £3, and
even then insisted on having his cheap pants
advertised on the large bear and his four-and-six-
penny hat on the small one, still he put up his
money manfully. It was the wild, hilarious boom-
time, when Melbourne was gay and riotous, and
allowed things to be done that it wouldn’t dream
of nowadays. The only serious interference that
the police put up was about noon, when they
ordered B. Sloman’s advertisement to be washed
off the bears under pain of prosecution for cruelty
to animals. It was washed off accordingly at a
street tap, and the firm of Johnson and Silver
remarked to itself that anyhow Slornan had paid
in advance, and had got his money’s worth.
The bears danced laboriously and badly, but
Johnson’s address was a great success, and
the takings were respectable. And in the
afternoon, when profits began to fall off, the
little bear put up a sudden, magnificent scrap
with a large dog, which raised his popularity to
fever heat.
The American wdio sold the pills which cured
large feet was communicated with per telephone
(from an hotel bar) about 11 o’clock, and when he
got the hang of the situation he took hold of an
evening paper reporter, and explained that the
eccentric conduct of the two most eminent and
brilliant pressmen in Australia, who were going
round Melbourne with a couple of bears, did not
arise from intoxication or vagrancy on their part,
but was done on the strength of a wager of £2OOO
made with the proprietors of Hoofdocker’s pills,
which were without a rival in either hemisphere,
as could be seen by a reference to the printed
testimonials. He added that Hoofdocker’s spent
£lOO,OOO a year in eccentric advertising of tiiis
character, in addition to taking up a larger space
in the newspapers than any other firm in the
trade. Johnson, who didn’t want his character as
a journalist to go utterly to pieces, read the
paragraph in his tenth or twelfth hotel, and it
made him feel better, though he said to himself
that Hoofdocker seemed to be working the
business for all it was worth. Also that grasp-
ing person insisted on having his advertise-
ment pasted on the bears—which caused some ill-
feeling, but nothing to speak of. About 4 o’clock,
after he had got rid of Hoofdocker, Johnson
dropped into his 17th hotel for a drink. He
didn’t remember coming out, and he doesn’t
remember it to this day.
* * * *
It appeared to be after an illimitable interval
that he heard voices. One of them seemed to be
delivering a lecture on bears—a lecture which had
grown so familiar with repetition that it had be-
come a weariness.
Other voices were raised in coarse, mirthful
aspersion. Johnson realised after a while that
the first voice was his own. He was in a three-
penny bar somewhere, and was applauding his own
remarks with a pewter pot on the counter while he
harangued an increasing crowd of customers. The
two bears roosted in a serious frame of mind on a
form, and an affable but irreverent mob was offer-
ing them biscuits, cheese, beer and sundries..
They seemed to be taking everything that was
going.
The clock said it was 9 p.m.—that left nearly
five hours unaccounted for. Johnson sidled to the
door without interrupting his discourse, and
glanced out. He knew the locality—it was down
by St. Kilda. That meant that several miles of
macadamised road were unaccounted for. Silver
—well, apparently, he was unaccounted for ; at
least, he was nowhere to be seen. Johnson felt in
his pockets, and realised about a pound’s worth of
silver coin. Apparently most of the day’s takings
and the bulk of the money which B. Slornan had
spent in advertising on the bears had gone some-
where—but where? Johnson felt anxious and
lonely.
The crowd reminded Johnson rather crossly
that it was waiting.
Johnson asked what on earth
it was waiting for.
The explanation, given with
various degrees of anger, was
not very lucid, but from it the
showman concluded that he was in
something of a difficulty. Appar-
ently the address which he had been
giving when he came to himself had pur-
ported to be the introduction to a marvellous per-
formance by the animals. The performance was
to be absolutely unique. He had punctuated his
sentences by smiting the counter with the pot,
and the pot was a ruin. The landlord made no
disguise of the fact that unless a high-class per-
formance was forthcoming the damage done to
the pot would require a great deal of explanation.
Johnson rose to the occasion as best he could,
and sternly ordered the smaller bear to dance.
The smaller bear only prospected with one paw for
a flea on its stomach, and treated its temporary
owner as if he were dead. He ordered the large
bear to dance. It shambled over to the counter
and held up its nose for a biscuit. Somebody
poured beer over its nose, and it snorted.
Apparently, though they would dance to please
Silver, they took no stock in strangers, and refused
to recognise Johnson. The landlord intimated that
he expected ample cash satisfaction for the
battered pot. One man said he would fight
Johnson if that would do any good.
By a blessed dispensation of Providence there
is, in almost every assemblage, a peacemaker.
There was one on this occasion—a tall young man
with a striped collar. He winked eloquently at
the crowd when Johnson wasn’t looking, and the
crowd became still and awaited developments.
He urged that the animals were probably tired,
and not quite at their best. He recommended
peace and brotherly love. Finally, he shouted
for Johnson, and said that if that gentleman
would give them the speech all over again they
would call things square, and there would be no
ill-feeling. And while Johnson was still con-
suming the liquor, the young man in the striped
collar gently led the small bear into the middle
of the road, faced it towards Melbourne, and gave
it a hearty kick. The small bear uttered a yelp
of surprise, and shambled off towards the city.
Then the tall young man surreptitiously led out
the large bear, faced it towards Gippsland, and
smote it hard on the tail with an empty bottle.
It uttered a kind of “ wu'fif! ” and lighted out for
the mountains. Then the peacemaker doubled up
in agonies of silent laughter.
The crowd inside had covered the retreat of
the live stock with another drink, and Johnson
was again going strong. His lecture on bears
generally was an impassioned piece of oratory,
equal to Cicero’s denunciation of Catiline, or the
impeachment of Warren Hastings. His long
arms cleared a wide space round him as he gesti-
culated fiercely with the beer-pot till it was worn
out. It was 10 o’clock when he reached his
peroration
“And, finally—hie— gentlemen, thesh faithful,
intelligent and devoted ”
He reached out his hand as he spoke and patted
the empty air where the larger devoted animal
had been. Then he glared. The guffaw that
went up was like the ro uof a cataract. The
peacemaker outside doubled up again with mirth.
“Them faithful animals of yours,” said the
landlord, briefly, “ went out of the door half-an-
liour ago.”
“I heard someone screaming ‘ murder !’ down
the road,” said the peacemaker between his
paroxysms. “I expect they’re killing somebody.”
Johnson expressed his opinion of the company
in one glittering curse, threw his beer pot into the
middle of next century, and ran through the
doorway. The moon was shining, and the lamps
were alight, but neither to right nor left did the
illumination show a black object shambling up the
road or down. It was late and lone and silent.
The peacemaker, still struggling with his stupen-
dous joke, intimated that the cries of “murder”
had come from “that way ’’—and pointed vaguely
towards Gippsland and Maoriland and the terri-
tories of the Chilian Republic.
Then Johnson uttered an arrangement of ground
and lofty swearing that is remembered there-
abouts to this day, and the fist at the end of his
long arm smote the peacemaker on the waistbelt.
The peacemaker doubled up with a yelp and flew
backwards.
The journalist was a man of action when he
Started. He ran like a hare to the next corner,
and looked up and down the long roads that lay
white and silent in the moonlight. There was no
bear.
He turned to the left and ran to the next
corner. Very long and white and straight are
the highways thereabouts, and on a clear night
things can be seen very far off. Still no bear.
The idea that his animals might have reverted
to a wild state and be doing all manner of
damage worried him. Besides, it seemed like
larceny as a bailee. He ran two more blocks, and
looked up and down more long white roads, all
to no purpose. Finally, in his anxiety, he roused
up a villa residence and asked if any bears had
been seen thereabouts that evening. A terrified

girl, who evidently regarded him as a dangerous
lunatic and a person to be humored, assured him
that though no bears had called an elephant had
just passed, and she pointed out the road it had
taken and urged him to pursue it at once. She
said that if he ran fast he couldn’t fail to overtake
it. Then she shut the door gently, and Johnson
heard her having hysterics inside. He went out
and closed the gate and tore his hair.
He met a policeman and asked if he had seen
any bears. The officer was an unusually small

one. He considered Johnson, and measured him
with his eye. He realised that the inquirer was a
tall, sinewy man who looked excited and might
be troublesome if roused. So he replied civilly
that all bears found wandering around loose were
taken to the police station. He said that some
days there were as many as a dozen there at one
time, and suggested that he and Johnson should
go along together and sort out Johnson’s bears
from the collection. As he said it his hand took
an insidious hold on the other man’s sleeve.
Johnson shook him off and ran. He had no time
to waste when £3O worth of lost bear was getting
more lost every moment, and people were possibly
being eaten up in all directions. And he wasn’t
taking any chances of going to police stations, and
being locked up as a lunatic by some fatuous con-
stable, and having the story in the papers next
morning. He was sobered by much running, and
he admitted, as he leaned against a tree to get his
second wind, that he had made enough history
during the last few days.
He went into an hotel just before closing
time and braced himself up with two whiskies.
Also he bought a flask to keep him up during the
night that was ahead of him. It was a lonely
hotel, and when he asked if any bears had been
seen thereabouts the girl served him with fear and
trembling.
In a house down a lonesome road in Elsternwick
he heard a disturbance which sounded hopeful. He
knocked firmly on the door and asked for his
bears. Water was poured on him from a top
window.
He emptied the flask after that, and became
again, for a time, full of Dutch courage. He
raged through Elsternwick, Balaclava, and ad-
jacent suburbs, and wherever he saw a light he
knocked up the inhabitants and asked for his
menagerie. Mostly he got a civil response, but
at one house water was again poured over him
from a balcony, and Johnson told the inhabitants
that this sort of thing was liable to become
monotonous. His blood was up, and he demanded
an apology. None being forthcoming, he broke
the bow window with a large clod of earth. A
dog came round the corner of the house and went
for him, but he knocked it out in one round, and
threw it over the tank.
By 1 a.m, the police of four suburbs were scour-
ing the highways and bye-ways in search of a
lengthy monomaniac about whom conflicting
stories were afloat. The only reason why they
didn’t find him was that Johnson had left the
roads by this time, and was devoting himself to a
vigorous search of all the back gardens he could
get into.
About 2 a.m. he got back by accident to the St.
Kilda-road, and gave it up. He was tired beyond
all expression, he was unspeakably dry, and the
earth had apparently opened up and swallowed
his two animals. He sat down on the edge of the
pavement and told the universe that he declined
to travel any further. The moon set. Johnson
decided that some belated vegetable cart would
be along soon from Brighton, and he would nego-
tiate a lift. If no vegetable cart came he would
wait for the first tram. Then he slept.
A bear passed him in his dreams, but he heeded
not.
About four he was awakened by the approach ot
something that looked like a black omnibus, and
he hailed it. The driver said that for a shilling
he could get in lengthwise by the back door, the
same way as the “ stiff ’un ” did, and he would be
taken to Melbourne. Johnson then realised that
he had hailed a belated hearse, but by that time
all things seemed alike, and he got in. The
vehicle dropped him in Bourke-street, almost
opposite the signboard of Smith and Silver’s un-
rivalled show, and Johnson said to himself that
this coincidence was the last stravy
The bears were never accounted for, and Silver,
when he turned up again, accused Johnson of steal-
ing the property, and the old friendship went to
pieces. Also, Silver sued Johnson for his bears,
but about this stage of the proceedings “mit ,

My Wife’s Second Husband.
world goes round, old fellow,
And still I’m in the swim,
While my wife’s second husband
Is growing old and grim.
I meet him in the city—
It all seems very tame —
He glances at me sometimes
As if I were to blame.
i
Oh, my wife’s second husband
Was handsome, young, and true;
He had his boyish visions
(I had my visions too).
He made a model lover- -
The greenest in the game—
They say, when I was married
That I was just the same.
Though I am ten years older
My hair is dark to-day,
While my wife’s second husband
Is quickly growing grey.
I drank when first he knew me,
And he drank not at all;
I see that he, through drinking,
Is going to the wall.
A sweet ill-treated woman,
A drunken brute (Good Lord !)
Ah, well, she got her freedom,
And he got his reward.
He’ll fight it out a season,
For Fate will not be forced,
But my wife’s second husband
Shall surely be divorced.
I sympathise, and wonder
What mutual friends would think
If my wife’s second husband
And I should have a drink.
And I a mere bystander—
It almost seems absurd—
Might lay prophetically
My hand on my wife’s third.
But my wife’s second husband
His sorrows shall forget.
We’ll clasp warm hands in friendship
And clink our glasses yet.
We’ll smoke cigars together,
In pure philosophy
While calmly contemplating
The fate of number three.

The Cow Girl.
E FOUND her there on a smoky night—and
she was a country maid,
Red lips and tawny hair and all—in a patch
of verandah-shade,
With all the guile of the Garden wild in her warm,
mysterious glance;
And the breeze sang soft to the timber out on the
river-flats behind,
And the store sheep down in the paddock sobbed
and burbled along the wind ;
And we smiled in the dark to think we’d struck
the track of the True Romance
And the bloated moon and the haloed stars swung
lazy down the sky,
And a lounging line of gaunt black cows went
stumbling slowly by,
While a sea of stubble whirred a-swish on the
lands beyond the ra,ils,
And the maiden harkened drowsily to the sound
of the whispering night;
Her hands were naked within my own—l thought
they were smooth and white !
And Jimmy, the dog in the dairy, bumped and
clattered among the pails.
And I gave her a kiss when I had to go—a kiss to
paint her dreams;
And I rode off blindly down the track to the
music of muttering streams
A-tinkle afar in the pitchy bush, with the West a
crimson blur,
As the moon and a bunch of the circling stars
went black in Lake 800100
Where the jumpers, loud in the reed-beds, roar
the noisy season through.
I could have breathed that scented dark the whole
night long—with her.
With her, in the dark —and she was a Blooming l
Sketch, for all I know ;
Splay hand and shiny face, perhaps; cheap lace
and calico,
And bulging hairpad ; flirty eyes, and eyebrows
arching vain ;
But yet, that night, I feel it yet, when the warm
night-breezes sigh
Through the timber-stretches—whene’er I see a red
moon in the sky
And I ride, hot nights, on a lonely track across a
smoky plain.

Eloped!
OH ! we flitted, she and T,
In a season long gone by,
To discover
In the realms of space a star
Brightly labelled “Hymen’s Car,”
And the angels laughed afar,
Each a lover !
But we spied our star at last,
Grabbed it as it floated past,
Then cavorted;
And the planets shed their rays
In a rich, resplendent blaze
Thro’ the happy, happy ways
Where we sported.
Ah ! but when we twain were missed
(“Flirtful maid and journalist
Gone eloping !”)
Then those men you should have seen,
On their tiny earth of green,
With their common-like machine
Telescoping!
And they talked, and winked, and gazed
In a manner most amazed,
As we glided
On that crazy, rocking star
Thro’ the Heavens bright and far,
Rash and uu particular—
And unguided !
And so, cosy and unstirred
Soon we very plainly heard
Folk beseech us
Both to leave our home of blue—
But we merely laughed, and threw .
Down a star, for they, we knew,
Couldn’t reach us !
And we sang in glee and scorn
Till the grey and cheerless morn,
When together
O ! we drifted out of sight
In a transcendental flight
Of delirious delight
Thro’ the ether.
But every night we’d race
Thro’ the starry realms of Space,
And the times
That we had gave joyful birth
To a poet’s mystic mirth,
Often mentioned down on earth
In his rhymes.
So we laughed in ecstacy,
And thro’ gleaming nebulae
Gallivanted,
Till by most atrocious luck
Crash ! —our little carriage struck
’Gainst a baggage-laden truck,
And it canted.
But I hope her darling ma
And her autocratic pa
Are forgiving;
For we clutched the air and fell
Down to where the mortals dwell—
But I ain’t agoin’ to tell
Where we’re living.

A Leaf Out of a Rhyming Diary.
SOMEBODY under my window
Is digging an April bed
For stocks and sweet anemones,
Pink, yellow, and white and red.
And in at the open casement
A shower of loam-dust floats,
Which mottles the sheet I write on,
My books and my hundred notes.
And I leave off work to wonder
At seeing a wild wasp bring
Buff-colored clay to build with
A home for its brood in Spring.
And up in the furthest corner
The locust I found last year
(The ants had eaten him hollow)
Clings tight to a Queensland spear.
Bees have made hives in a lion,
At least so the Good Book saith—
Spiders have built in the skulls of
Kings in the bosom of Death.
But I can tell of the locust
(Drawing-room, dining and bed)
Transformed to the country mansion
Of Vespa the newly wed.
Vespa’s a wasp in the Latin ;
Vespa , the beautiful thing ;
But (Vespa or Wasp ) it cannot
Change her immutable sting.
Someone is digging the garden,
And in at the window floats
A shower of dust all over
My books and my hundred notes.

Looking Backward.
IN the mystic Long Ago,
Ages backward from the Now,
When you were in embryo,
In the mystic Long Ago—
Very well, I seem to know,
That you were a brindled cow,
In the mystic Long Ago,
Ages backward from the Now.
In the shadow-shrouded Past,
When you were a brindled cow,
I was as an ox then classed,
In the shadow-shrouded Past;
And we met, dear love, at last—
Do not ask me where or how —
In the shadow-shrouded Past,
When you were a brindled cow.
When we later met again
You were then an antelope ;
And you gambolled on the plain
When we later met again.
Ah, I sought you not in vain,
You were kind and bade me hope—
When we later met again
You were then an antelope.
Can it be that you forget
When you were a kangaroo ?
You were clumsy then, my pet,
Can it be that you forget ?
Do no mem’ries linger yet
How I bounced round after you ?
Can it be that you forget
When you were a kangaroo ?
Diff rent tails of every kind—
Long and curly, short and straight—
Have adorned us, love, behind.
Diff’rent tails of every kind,
We have flourished in the wind,
Through the processes of Fate—
Diff’rent tails of every kind,
Long and curly, short and straight.
’Spite the tails diversified
We have waggled in our time,
We’ve been ever side by side—
’Spite the tails diversified ;
And, to-day, we’re man and bride,
Minus tails, but looking prime,
’Spite the tails diversified
We have waggled in our time !

is all desolate, bilious and sad,
Pallid monotony, grey upon grey ;
Scarcely the glows of the morning seem
glad,
There is no lilt of delight in the day.
But I remember when Nature was gay,
Kissing and coaxing my darling and me.
Greatly I long to be up and away...
Oh, for some palms and a tropical sea !
Streets with vile slush are all beastly, and bad
Devils of gloom in the weather hold sway;
Every smug idiot has a new fad—
Yabbering dolts it’s not lawful to slay.
I, who once frolicked with sylph and with fay,
Out in the North where life is still free,
Scarce can draw breath in this ooze where I
stay.. .
Oh, for some palnm and a tropical sea !
Here a pall hangs over lassie and lad,
Sombrely through youth’s high noontide they
stray.

Here is this murk where the Puritans bray).
Little they wot of Queen Joy’s disarray.
Hell is more cheerful than Perth or Dundee.
As for Dunedin... some words I can’t say ...
Oh, for some palms and a tropical sea !

For my sad soul in its loneliness pray.. .

Fiddler’s Green.
ONE shipmate fell down an empty hold,
What time that his own was full.
And one said ‘ ‘ So-long ” in Nordenskold
Another in Liverpool;
And one was swept from the fo’c’sle head,
Of a clipper, long and lean.
But wherever they be —alive or dead—
We shall meet in Fiddler’s Green.
Then, no more heaving the anchor up,
Or haul till your hands are flayed.
We shall starve no more on the bite and sup,
Allowed by the Board of Trade.
We shall eat soft tack, and drink the best,
Like the bloomin’ King and Queen;
And all night long we shall take our rest,
In our beds, in Fiddler’s Green.
And all are the same as you and I
In the place where the shellbacks go.
And fo'c’sle Jack will argufy
Wifh the mate of the P. & 0.
Then serve out tots at every bell.
Filled up till you sing out “ When,”
And Sue will be there, and Bess, and Nell,
To dance with the sailormen.
There’s a golden gate that folks ashore
Pass through when they come to die.
There are pearls and precious stones galore
In their mansions in the sky.
They sit all day by a crystal lake,
A-singin’ of Sankey’s hjmns,
With robes as white as a steamer’s wake,
A-flamin’ about their limbs.
But Fo’c’sle Jack is a hard, hard case,
And yet too good to ban.
He goes at last to a resting place,
Apart from his fellow man ;
Where all is feasting, and fun, and jest,
And a parson ne’er is seen.
When my time comes may I join the rest
In the port of Fiddler’s Green.

Flea !
Listen to me !
I was before B.C.
And shall continue after—long after—A.D.
As those who live will see,
I—the hopping, jumping, agile little Flea !
You take it from me.
I am the Friend of Man —
I am the Spur of Canis—
In the moonlight, by the sea-side, in the sand, 1

For Man—
And Woman—for the Lovers !
Suddenly I spring upon them !
Thus Twain have become Three [
Ah-ha ! Tra-la !
Soon they notice me—
Whom yet they cannot see—
ME!

perating Flea !
The domesticated, happy, little Flea !
Many prayers have been uttered over me—
Many curses have been muttered over me—
Many candles, too, have guttered over me—
Even as before a god !
I skip, I dance,
Like the young he-goats, and the little hills.
Pulex irritans—
That’s me !
The mighty ; the bitey ;
Co-belligerent with the B. —flat B.
I, the world-roamer. Ho !
I am wrapped with purple and fine linen,
And fare sumptuously every day.
And, again, I am clothed with rags,
And eat dirt. Selah !
But it is all alike to me,
The blithesome, lightsome, bitesome, frolicsome
Flea !
You may slay me and bray me,
You may rush me and crush me,
You may throw dust in my hair and in my eyes,
You may seek me with lethal nail and finger,
You may employ all your arts of averruncation—
I shall not linger 1
Even as you seek to grasp me and to clasp me,
I elude you and deride you—
I am here—beside you !
And now I override you and bestride you—
Go to .
I am the Flea !
I am the aggravating, immemorial Conquering
One.
I couch with Kings and partake with Princes—
I, who was before the Age of Stone,
And before the Age of Bronze,
And before the Flood !
Who saw Babylon upbuilded,
Who welcomed Abraham upon the Plains of
Shinar,
And walked with Moses ;
I, to whom the first Pharaoh was a parvenu !
Who was the oldest Plague in Egypt;
Who conducted Israel through the Wilderness,
And dwelt in Canaan, Selah !
AVho abode with Csesar ;
Yea, verily ; and in Old Rome was named with a

The Flea !
That’s ME !
To whom all doors are open,
To whom all altars are free.

A Lakes Romance.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
/rpHE s.s. Borneo lay at the Sale wharf
I putting and punting impatiently, and
emitting large volumes of discolored
smoke. The captain, watch in hand, threw
anxious glances up the glaring white road to the
town.
“ Train’s late,” he remarked to the engine-room
stuff, who lounged half in and half out of the
little hatch. The gentleman addressed removed
a blackened pipe from an equally grimy face with
a hand to match, and answered “ Aye.”
The crew on the hunk lounged sleepily against
the vessel's fat side, moving only to hitch his
pants and fight the Hies.
“ It ought to be in,’’ said the skipper, irritably.
“ Aye,” assented the engine-room staff.
“Got all ’em fish boxes on board, George?”
inquired the skipper, suddenly.
The crew pointed a pipe-stem to a pile of boxes
in the bows, round which the flies hovered atten-
tively.
“Smell ’em !” be replied, laconically.
The captain threw a glance up the road, closed
his watch with an angry snap, and gave the order
to “Leggo.”
The engine-room staff disappeared down the
hatch, and could be heard hurling tilings about
below. The crew hitched his pants, and leisurely
proceeded to cist off, after which he ninthly
leaped on board.
The boat had pounded its way into mid-stream
with much creaking and groaning and churning of
discolored water, when there was a loud “ hullo”
from the road, and a crazy, luggage-laden cab
came pounding down the hill, and, pulled up on
the bank, with about an inch to spare between it
and the river. The skipper paused, irresolute
fora moment, breathing curses., Then, as a fair
vision in white stepped daintily from the cab, be
put his mouth to the engine-room pipe and yelled:
“ Back her down, Mac ! Back her down for the
Queen of the Fairies.”
“What a funny old boat ! ” exclaimed the girl,
as the vessel struggled painfully back to the bank.
After paying the cabman in assorted coin, and
cautioning the crew as to the handling of her
numerous trunks, the girl allowed herself to be
assisted on board.
“Oh, what a horrid smell,” she said, putting a
dainty handkerchief to hermose. *
“ On’y fish-boxes,” said George, deprecatingly.
“ Won’t notice ’em when we gets into the lakes.”
“ Hurry along then, do,” she said, seating her-
self as far from the obnoxious boxes as possible.
She settled herself in the shade with much
adjusting of skirts, produced a book and a packet
of sweets, and began to read. The crew hovered
round, ostensibly busy with the passenger’s lug-
gage—in reality gazing at the owner in undis-
guised and open-mouthed admiration. She looked
up and saw him. He blushed under the tan and
dropped a hat-box.
“Please be careful,” she cried. “ There’s a cake
in there and a bottle of tomato-sauce.”
The distressed George wiped his streaming
brow, and finished stacking the luggage. She
called him to her and asked him his name; in-
quired how long he had been at sea ; did he like
it; was he ever sick; would it be rough in the
lakes; was the boat seaworthy, and what made
the fish-boxes in the front such unpleasant com-
pany.
The bewildered seaman answered as best he
could till the skipper, who was secretly jealous,
called on him not to stand there gossiping like a
fishwife, but to come and take the wheel. George
reluctantly relieved the skipper, who retired below
to brush his hair and change his tie, preparatory
to coming on deck and engaging the passenger in
conversation. He was a tall, handsome man, of
about 35, with a light-brown moustache of which
he was justifiably proud, and which had contri-
buted in a great measure towards making him the
popular man he was among the ladies of the
Lakes.
When he returned to the deck, he found the
3 ' meseu in her book. He walked
return- “ severa l times, Tout she seemed
f„i - ier reading. He coughed behind his
; he walked past again ; then stopped in
front of her, opened his mouth to speak, caught
sight of two haughty blue eyes fixed on a book,
and strolled on. He was nonplussed. She was
annoyed at him, no doubt, because be interrupted
her conversation with George. Perhaps he had
spoken a bit sharply. That reference to a “fish-
wife,” too, was unfortunate'! Hang George !
What right had he to speak to a girl like that ?
“Here goes!” lie said to himself, and ap-
proached her boldly. “Nice day,” he ventured.
The girl appeared not to hear him.
“It’s a nice day,” he repeated in a louder
voice.
The girl put down her book and eyed him
coldly. “I beg your pardon?” she said.
“ It’s—it’s a nice day,” said the skipper for the
third time.
The girl looked all round as if she had not
noticed the fact before. “Oh, is it?” she said,
“I mean yes.” Then she resumed her book.
The skipper said something to himself and turned
away just in time to observe a delighted grin on
the face of George.
He walked forward and relieved his feelings by
a five minutes’ dissertation in subdued tones to
that suffering mariner on the general dangers
arising from a steersman looking over his shoulder,
and the particular peril of any man laughing at
him—the skipper.
“ I was on’y scratchin’ me chin on me shoul-
der,” said George in defence.
“ Well, don’t!” said the skipper fiercely, “or
111 scratch your back with a rope’s-end.”
He turned away to find the girl leaning on the
rail near by with a look of pity in her eye for
George and a look of disgust for himself. With-
out further words he disappeared below.
A few minutes later, as he ascended the hidden
he heard George’s voice : “ Oh, Vs a ’error !
Drinks somethink terrible ! Talk about temper !”
He heard the girl’s soft coo of sympathy and
more libellous statements from George. The
blood rushed to the face. He walked to the
wheel and addressed the passenger coldly : “I
must request you, madam, not to talk to the man
at the wheel; you imperil the ship and all our
lives.” He waved a hand towards the fish-boxes,
then walked away and leant over the stern-rail.
Ihe passenger resumed her chair and book, but,
as the skipper noted with satisfaction, she was no
longer calm.
Suddenly he left the rail and approached the
girl. She put her book down, and prepared to
receive him with a hostile glare.
“Tickets, please!” said the skipper, in a busi-
ness-like voice without a glance at her. The girl
opened the chatelaine bag that dangled from her
slim waist, and groped inside with two pink
fingers. ( Tickets for the s.s. Borneo are issued
by the railways along with the railway ticket.)
I lie girl added another pink filiger to the search
party, then emptied the contents of her bag out
into her lap. It contained a glove button, a piece
of stamp-paper, a packet of pins, a train-ticket,
an acid-drop, a powder-puff, a pocket mirror and
2Jsd. in c >ppers.
“Oh ! cried the girl in distress, “ I’ve lost my
purse. I must have left it m the cab.”
“Yes?” said the skipper, sarcastically.
“Don’t you believe me?” inquired the pas-
senger, hotly.
“ Certainly,” answered the captain, but his tone
carried no conviction.
“This is very awkward !” said the lady.
“Very,” said the other, dryly.
“ What—what are you going to do?” inquired
the girl, humbly. “ I have lost my purse, as you
see, and I have only-2 Ad. left. 1 am—was going
to Cunningham, but lie they don't expect me,
and there'll be no one to meet me.’’
KO WAGER.
THE SPORT : “ Hi, lady! I gotten a bub in me pocket that says this ore’s the belter dory.”
She dabbed at her blue eyes with a lace-edged
handkerchief, and looked piteously at the skipper.
He felt a brute, but he had his game to play.
“This is very, very awkward,” he mused.
“ I have it ! ” cried the girl with sudden inspi-
ration ; “I’ll give you this meanwhile.”
She detached a ring from her engagement
finger, and held it out to him.
He drew himself up with dignity. “Madam.”
he said, “I am no pawnbroker. I must ask you
for your name and address.”
She informed him her name was Hilda Dauby,
and gave him minute particulars and directions
regarding her abode, as a guarantee of good faith.
She was sensitive, lest he should think her an
adventuress. She already mote than regretted
her treatment of him.
The brown moustache and square jaw were get-
ting in some deadly work. When he had taken
down her name and address in an important-look-
ing pocket-book, the skipper bowed and retired.
As he disappeared, Miss Dan by ran forward to
the wheel. “George, dear George,” she said,
softly, “can you lend me some money? 1 have
only 2!>d., so if you can lend me ” (she made a
rapid calculation with her fingers on his arm)—
“ lend me—er —three and ten to make up the five
shillings I ”
George twirled the wheel and groaned. “Lor’
lumme, Miss!” he cried in anguish, “I’d lend
you me soul, but this is Friday, and I ain’t got a
cent.”
Miss Danby retired in confusion as the skipper
bounded up the ladder and demanded to know
where the several things George was steering.
He did not glance at the girl, which all the more
made her feel a desperate character.
“ You don’t think that —that I did it on pur-
pose ? ” she cried as he walked past her.
“It is not my business to think, ” he replied,
coldly. “I have to watch my owners’interests.”
“Miss! Miss!” hissed George, as the captain
retired; “keep yer pecker up. I’ll borrer the
cash at Holland’s Landing. We’re there now ! ”
The girl thanked him with a look. The chivalrous
George felt repaid usuriously.
Holland’s Landing was an unimpressive settle-
ment. It consisted of a crazy jetty, piled with
fish-boxes, on which were seated two plethoric-
looking fishermen. The other items were one hut,
a few fishing nets drying on a line, a strong odor
of ancient fish and lots of scenery.
George left the wheel and rushed to the side
and threw a rope on the jetty. One of the fisher-
men put his foot on it before it could slide over
into the water, leisurely picked it up, put it round
a projecting pile, and resumed his seat. “ Bill !
8.1 l !” called George to him.
“ Wadjerwan?” inquired Bill.
“ Len’s five bob till Monday !” said George.
“ Wha—what!” said Bill. “Lend yer five
bob. ’Oo yer talcin’ fer a walk ? ”
“Lifeandeaf?” hissed George. “I’ll pay yer
back ten on Monday.”
“Ten what?” inquired Bill, suspiciously.
“ Bob, stoopid,” said George, desperately.
“’Onor bright.” *
That seemed to arouse Bill. He spoke to his
friend, who shared the fish-boxes with the tl.es.
That gentleman, after systematic search through
numerous pockets, ifiidly shook his head. Bill
then disappeared in the l>aokground { He re-
turned in a few moments and displayed three
greasy shillings. “All! kin raise, ”he said.
“ ’And ’em over,” said George, who was disem-
barking more fish-boxes.
“Six bob on Monday, mind,” haggled Bill, the
Usurer.
“Right you are,” said George.
The girl received the greasy coins with grati-
tude. “Thank you,'George,” was all she said ;
but George went bade to his fish-boxes with a
wildly beating heart. To him, at that moment,
they smelt like a rose, garden.
Miss Danby sought out the skipper. “What
is the fare from Sale to here?” she inquired.
“ Half-a-crown.” *
“Then here’s your fare. Kindly put my lug-
gage ashore.”
The skipper looked in consternation at the
scaly coins in his palm. “Just one moment,” he
said, catching her by the arm. “ You can’t get
off here —there’s onlvbi few fishermen. The rest
is scrub and sand and snakes.”
“Pardon me,” said she, determinedly, disen-
tangling her arm, “I am going ashore.” He
caught her round the waist and held her tight.
She could see his jaw set.
“ You are not going ! ” he cried.
“ I am ! ”
“You amn’t—l mean you aren’t.”
He held her close and gave the order to cast off.
It was not till they were well out in mid-stream
that he reluctantly loosened his hold. The girl
sank on to the rail and sobbed bitterly into her
handkerchief.
“ My Gawd, I’ll stiffen him if I swing for it ! ”
cried George.
He deserted the wheel, grabbed a fish-box and
with that in his hand and murder in his eye
charged the skipper and bashed him on the head
till he sank on the deck.
“Oh ! oh ! You’ve killed him ! ” cried the girl.
“Good on ’im,” said the mutineer, unrepen-
tantly. “I’ll swing for’im gladly.” •
“Water! Bring water!” ordered Miss Hilda,
stooping over the prostrate man. And when
George returned with the dog’s drinking trough,
the skipper’s head was pillowed on her lap.
Then George had the dissatisfaction of seeing
his victim slowly reviving under the influence of a
lir x 2 bandage saturated with dog’s drink.
“How do you feel now?” she inquired,
anxiously, as she pressed part of the to a
bump on his brow.
“I feel lovely,” said the skipper dreamily.
“Let me up and at him.”
“ISIo! no!” cried the girl, pressing her hand
on his jaw. She withdrew it hastily as he kissed
it with an impassioned kiss. “You mustn’t!”
she said, softly.
The scowling George from the wheel watched
her put her arms round the prostrate man and
assist him to his feet. Also, he saw his late vic-
tim, with one arm round the passenger’s neck,
piloted carefully to her deck-chair. George
gnashed his teeth.
The skipper lay back in the chair with half-
closed eyes.
Women are nurses by instinct, and Miss Dauby
was no exception. She fussed round the skipper
with cushions and fans and scent-sprays. It took
him a long time to recover. Recovery was too
enjoyable and precious a thing to waste. He
used it slowly and sparingly. He used it to tell
her of many hair-breadth escapes and adventures
of which he was the hero. They grew very
friendly. Poor George, at the wheel, was almost
forgotten till the girl said: “Promise me one
thing.”
“ Anything in life,” said the skipper, fervently.
“You must forgive George. It was all my
fault.”
After a thoughtful pause the skipper mag-
nanimously gave the required promise. It elevated
him in her opinion, and, for him, solved an awk-
ward problem.
“I want something in return,” he said, presently.
“ I want you to give me that ring now.”
“Oh,” cried the girl; “my engagement ring.”
The skipper groaned. “I feared so,” he mut-
tered. The girl blushed deeply, and dropped her
eyes.
“ He doesn’t know we are engaged,” she said,
softly, after a long pause.
“He doesn’t know—who doesn’t know?” ex-
claimed the skipper.
“ My fiance.”
“Explain! ” said the bewildered captain, shortly.
“ Well, you see,” said the girl, with her eyes on
her neat shoes, “ he wanted me to marry him, but
I didn’t think I cared sufficiently. Then he
wrote, and I wasn’t sure if I did or not, but when
ne wrote again f felt I ought to marry him, but I
didn t answer liis letter ; I thought I’d come down
and give him a surprise. So here I am. Oh, you
mustn t! The ring? Oh, I. was. looking after
that for him for safety—he said I was to wear it
when I was ready. Poor Jim ! I reall ydo think
1 cared for him a little bit, but now”
“ But now ? ” suggested the skipper, softly.
“ Now I don't think I do—not for him.”
“And you won't tell him?” whispered the
captain.
“Not—not if you don’t want me to,” answered
the girl. \
!’ said the skipper, seizing her hand.
“Damn !” said George, tearing l«s hair.

The Ultra-Sight:
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Y I HE ways beyond the Milky v\y are strange
and dark and far ; ’
They lie within the Outer Night, unlit by
any star;
Utterly cold and void are remote from
changing spheres
That heed the tides of life and death, and mark
the passing years.
To you, compact of thought alone, is given the
ultra-sight; **
The warp and woof of Time and Space, the wide-
spun web of Night,
Are yours to hold within your ken. The swift,
mysterious rays
Fail in the regions where you tread—the endless
outer ways.
And you that lie within their woof, and watch,
with wondering eye,
That firefly-swarm of circling suns, the universe,
drift by—
You saw it break the web of night and pass to
night again ;
You saw it cleave the dark, and grow, and fade
beyond your ken.
O splendid shone the Ring of Stars—as they came
whirling by
They shot their rays on every side to search the
sullen sky ; ,
The comets and the nebulae, the sun and asteroid,
Within a mesh of golden chains hung out across
the void.
l
They passed you as you leaned through space and
took no heed of time—
The living sun, the dying sun, the dead sun hoar
with rime ;
The black and barren suns went by, huge skele-
tons and old,
Set round with ebon satellites, stupendously they
rolled. *
For every star that burst the dark and flung its
lavish rays,
A thousand others, black and grim, moved oil
their gloomy ways;
And so the living host went by, enchained with
all its dead ;
It glimmered slowly out of sight, and into dark-
ness sped.
A million million years of dark, of silence, and of
cold;
And through a million million years no sun did
you behold ;
A million million years again have glided past
your face.
When, lo ! a star had cleft the night and wandered
into space.
A single wandering star that moved on some
eternal quest,
Tts tiny worlds about it hung, uncertain, without
rest,
Borne outward from the loom of things it floated
evermore
Into an endless sea of Time —a sea that knew no
shore.
And out of aeons that had passed you leaned
through space to see ,
A second universe swing out and swarm tumul-
tuously ;
It was the host of Singing Suns that whirr with
utter speed ;
In flaming grandeur did they pass, and olden
Night succeed.
And, ages after those that sang, the Dead Suns
drifted by,
A myriad mighty darkened globes, that swept
across the sky ;
Their gloomy satellites hung out to suck the ray-
less night
And catch some dregs of astral dust or wandering
meteorite.
Vast skeletons of stellar things, once fervent,
now grown cold ;
They droned across infinity, and huge were they
and old ;
For they had gathered up the dust of infinite
degrees,
And they, the Drones, in ages past had been the
blue-white Bees.
As they went rolling mightily, the mammoth suns
of space,
You saw in them the end of things, as they went
past your face—
That even stellar fires would fade, and deep
quiescence reign,
And wandering stars be ever lost, and systems
flame in vain.
The ways beyond the Galaxy are strange and
dark and far ;
They lie within the Outer Night, unlit by-any
star;
And you that lie within their woof throughout
unnumbered years,
Shall see the Universe grow still, and light for
sake the spheres.

THE MIDNIGHT TRAM.


The Housekeeper at Dulla.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BREAKFAST had been earlier than
usual at Dulla, as Toby Carson, the
manager, was driving his wife that morn-
ing to Beaudesert, where she would stay for the
month or six weeks that he expected to be away
with cattle. Work had not yet started in the
blacksmith’s shop. The two mechanics, over
their pipes, were discussing a delicate problem
with Mat Conyers and Jim, who was nicknamed
Webster. The latter they had picked up at
Gater’s pub. the previous evening. His mate,
Murty Brown, was in the hut sleeping off the
effects of too much conviviality as the result of
meeting old friends. Jim had just been engaged
for the road. Murty hadn’t been similarly for-
tunate, and the finances of the firm being at a
desperately low ebb, the question of a profitable
occupation for him was a serious one.
A housekeeper was wanted to take charge of
the place, in conjunction with Selina, the pretty
housemaid, during the absence of Mr. and Mrs.
Carson. The subject had been debated with Mrs.
Gater at the hotel, and it was settled, to their
mutual satisfaction, that Murty Brown should
have the situation.
“ Murty likes a bit of fun,” said Conyers, “ and
I don’t see why he shouldn’t provide it.”
“Eggs-acklv,” said Scully. “An’ ’tull be a
nice, rosy billet for him. He ought to jump at it.”
“ He’s the best material here to make a woman
out of, anyway,” said Conyers. “ He’s got small
hands that ain’t been disfigured much with hard
work, an’ a squeak in his voice that ’ll pass for a
woman’s. He’s pretty clean about the lip an’
cheeks, too, an’ when he shears that wisp round
his throat an’ powders a bit, he ought to pass.
Toby won’t see much of him, an’ if Selina bowls
him out, we can easily talk her over. Seems a
good, simple sort, who wouldn’t make any fuss.”
“ I’ll speak to Toby ’fore he goes,” said Tarkal-
son. “ Lemnte see. We’ll call him Mrs.
Winkles.”
“Mind your pronouns, William,” cautioned
Jim.
“She’s stoppin’ at Gater’s while’er ’usband’s
away shearin’,” Tarkalson continued, “an’ she’d
be glad of a job for a month or tw r o. A rough,
staggyfied-lookin’ old piece she is (which
should be consolin’ to the missus), but a good
grafter, an’ thoroughly reliable. Mrs. Gater ken
confidently recommend her. That’ll satisfy
Toby.”
“ See him at once, Bill,” Conyers advised, “an
Jim an’ me will go an’ talk Murty out of his sex.
He’s bound to be a bit obstropulous at first.”
“You needn’t anticipate any impediments in
the arrangements, Mr. Conyers,” Jim interrupted.
“His impecuniosity will be an inducement
from the jump. I know Brown. Let’s interview
him.”
Tarkalson’s part in the negotiations occupied
only a few minutes, but nearly an hour elapsed
before Conyers and Jim returned with Murty.
“Well?” said Tarkalson.
“ Mrs. Winkles is agreeable,” Jim announced.
Ho nodded towards the vanishing vehicle.
“ What’s the governor’s proclamation ?”
“Conyers is to take the waggonette an’bring
her up at once.”
“Good!” said Jim. “I’ll go with him and
superintend the transmogrification. Are you
ready, Mary Ann ? ”
“Who the ’ell are you callin’ Mary Ann?”
Murty demanded, firing up.
“ He’s a bit obfuscated yet,”
Jim explained apologetically to the
company. “Get the locomotive,
Conyers, and we’ll obliterate him at
once. And,” he added, turning to
the indignant Brown, “mind you
moderate your vernacular when
you’re Mrs. Winkles, and conduct
yourself with the utmost decorum
lie fore the immaculate Selina.”
“’Twon’t matter when I’m
Mrs. Winkles how I conduct
rueself afore S’lina,” Murty
returned. “ I’ll’ave to be care-
ful what I say afore the men.”
“ Likewise be deaf and blind
to their palaver and blandish-
ments, Mary Ann,” Jim ad-
yised.
Their laughter evoked no
response from Murty, and he
departed with mixed feelings.
Arrived at Gater’s, they lost no
time in getting to work on the
transformation. This wasn’t
all smooth sailing. To begin
with, Murty couldn’t see the sense
of changing his trousers and socks for stockings,
till Jim explained that Selina would be sure to
notice them sometime when he stooped, or stood
on a chair, or fell over something. Such catas-
trophes happen to women at times, and it is good
policy to be properly dressed for the occasion.
The corsets he threw out of the window as un-
worthy of argument. If his waist wasn’t the
orthodox style, they might tight-lace him a bit in
that quarter with a saddle-trap. Then Conyers
approached him with two pink pin-cushions.
“What’s them fakements for?” Murty de-
manded.
“Them’s your bust,” said Conyers. “You’re
a bit flat-chested for a dame of your age.”
Murty peered down at the excrescences with
mutinous eyes. His hand stole behind him.
“Yer not puttin’ an improver on me, areyer?”
he queried.
“You want a lot of improvin’ yet,” Conyers
informed him.
‘ I mean the swellin’ behind wot they call a
bustle,” Murty explained.
“Don’t alarm yohrself,” said Jim ; “the pro-
tuberance is obsolete. But we can accommodate
you with a crinoline.”
“ Darn the crinoline,” snapped Murty. “It’s
enough to put a bustle on me chest ’thout makin
a balloon of me. Where do I carry me sweat-
rag ? ” he asked suddenly, as his blouse was drawn
on.
“I n your bosom,” said Conyers. “You’ll want
some eau-de-cologne for it.”
“In me bosom ! ” Murty repeated, and chuckled
mirthlessly.
Conyers was busy with the skirt. It was a
heavy black one, with several rows of pleats and
tucks at the bottom, and of a waist limit that
affected Murty’s breathing apparatus when it was
hooked. Then he was handed over to Mrs. Gater
for the artistic touches, which she performed with
a joviality that Murty at once resented and
envied. He felt like a funeral himself. A prize-
packet brooch was pinned at his throat, and his
ears having been pierced in his youth, the good
woman couldn’t resist encumbering them with
two pendulous ornaments ; his face was beautified
with rouge and powder and other mysteries, all
of which, Murty ascertained, would wash off when
required ; a pink ribbon encircled his neck, and,
topped with a gargantuan dish-cover hat, spe-
cially designed for tropical suns, the transition
from Murty Brown to Mary Ann Winkles was
complete.
“Now, let’s see you do the block,” said Jim.
Murty started with swinging arms and the thump
of an elephant. “ Abbreviate your stride, or
you’ll burst through the fabrication,” said the
mentor. “ Hold your appendage—so, and don’t
make a flutter as though you were an agitated
tarpaulin. Now elevate your parasol. That’s it.
How do you particularise her, Mrs. Gater?”
“Oh, she’s simply magnificent,” Mrs. Gater re-
plied, with tears in her eyes.
“Looks charming,” said Conyers.
“Give her a small decoction of rum and cloves
for her spasms, Mrs. Gater,” Jim requested, “and
then we’ll elope with her.”
Everybody at the hotel turned out to see her
off, and they all said “Good-bye, Mrs. Winkles,”
and hoped she would like her place. Mrs. Winkles
hoped so too. She breathed with difficu’ty, and
perspired freely, and ultimately disappeared in a
cloud of dust.
Arrived at the homestead, Conyers escorted her
to the front door, and, having introduced her to
Selina, left her with much haste to join Tarkalson
and Scully, who were outside the shop examining
some old wheels they didn’t want. Jim had a fit
in the stable, after which he took the horses out,
and also hurried round to the shop, blowing his
nose and wiping his eyes. Selina showed Mrs.
Winkles to her room, eyeing her with every indi-
cation of disapproval en route.
“You look hot,” she remarked. “Perhaps
you’d like to rest till dinner-time?”
“I would,” Mrs. Winkles affirmed, with
alacrity, “I’m sweatin’ like a horse.”
Selina sat down on the bed, while Mrs.
Winkles got from under her hat.
“What short hair you have,” remarked Selina,
biting her lip todiscourage the threatened develop-
ment of a giggle.
“I suffer with headaches,” Mrs. Winkles ex-
plained. “ Th’ doctor told me I’d never have
any relief till I cropped it. Such lovely hair I
used to have, too. Dick used to admire it.”
“Dick’s your husband? What shed’s he working
at?”
A LIQUID DONATION.
BANDMASTER : “ Vinkelhoff, you mid your insdrv-
mendt go und gollect, and mind you dond’t
spill some! ”
“I can't think of the name of it now,” Mrs.
Winkles answered, pondering. “I’ve got a
shockin’ memory for names, you wouldn’t think.
It’s out west, anyway.”
“It would be nice for you if he got on here,”
Selina suggested. “So much better than travel-
ling about.”
“It would,” Mrs. Winkles admitted, “but I
wouldn’t care to stop permanent. I s’pose there’s
plenty to do in this caboose ? ”
“The washing and ironing are the worst,”
Selina replied. “ There’s a pile of white dresses
and shirts, cuffs and collars, and other starched
things.” Mrs. Winkles opened her eyes and
mouth, and stared. “That and the scrubbing
and general cleaning-up can all be done the first
week,” said Selina. “Then you’ll have it pretty
easy till the missus comes back. There’ll only be
the jam to make, and the mending and darning
and sewing to do.”
“Jam mendin’ darnin’ sewin’?” Mrs;
Winkles repeated, diving distressfully into her
bosom for her sweat-rag.
“There’s a big bundle of damaged hosiery,”
Selina proceeded. “And there’s several pillow-
slips to make and new sheets to hem. Of course,
it won’t take long to run them up on the machine.”
“No —of course not.”
“ The baby’s clothes will take the longest ”
“ Ba-by’s—clothes!” Mrs. Winkles gasped,
with a horror-stricken expression that was pathetic
in its intensity.
A DELICATE OPERATION.
BILLY : “ Wot's the matter with the motor, mate?”
THE MOTOR MAN : “ Yer wouldn’t understand if I was ter tell yer. It takes years, and
years, and years! ”
Selina nodded. “She left a list of what she
wanted, in the workroom.”
“Did she?”
“ And the material —flannelette, linen, thread,
tape, and so forth —it’s all ready to hand”-
“ But I didn’t know she had it.”
“ The baby ? Oh, it hasn’t arrived yet. But
missus thought it a good time, I suppose, to get
things ready, as Mrs. Gater recommended you as
specially experienced in that line.”
“ Mrs. Gater’s th’ two ends of a blamed ass ! ”
said Mrs. Winkles, fiercely. “ How would an old
bushy like me know anything about babies now?”
“ How long have you been married ? ” asked
Selina.
“ Oh, years. Years an’years. I disremember
how many. Charlie could tell,”
“ Who’s Charlie ? ”
“My ’usband —Mr. Winkles.”
“ I thought you said his name was Dick ? ”
Mrs. Winkles started. “You see,” she said,
and coughed behind her hand to hide her embar-
rassment, “his name’s Richard Charles, So
sometimes I call him Dick, an’sometimes Charlie.
Th’ name of him don’t get monotonous that way.”
“What a funny idea! Well, I must go and
lay the table for the men ; and, meanwhile, you can
have a rest.” .
Left to herself, Mrs. Winkles, after an exhaus-
tive search for her pocket, and a liberal use of bad
language, extracted her pipe and proceeded'to
smoke herself into something like a settled- state
of mind. Unfortunately, Selina returned unex-
pectedly, and, unable to find that pocket again as
speedily as circumstances demanded, she con-
cealed the pipe in her lap. Selina sniffed and
looked round suspiciously. In a moment, as
though in answer to her unspoken query, Mrs.
Winkles’ lap began to belch smoke like a minia-
ture volcano. Selina shouted “Lookout! your
dress is afire ! ” in such a startling manner that
Mrs. Winkles jumped to her feet without think-
ing, and the shameful pipe clattered loudly on the
floor.
Selina looked horrified. “Oh, Mrs. Winkles,
do you smoke ? ”
Mrs. Winkles coughed desperately, and beat
her chest. “I’m afflicted with th’ asthma,
S’lina, an’ the doctor ses I must smoke asthmatic
tobacco for it. You don’t mind me, do you ? ”
“Oh, it’s nothing to do with me,” Selina
answered coldly, and withdrew.
Mrs. Winkles addressed some ornamental re-
marks to the offending pipe and the unfindable
pocket, then sought relief to her shattered nerves
in further indulgence. At the same time she
formed her plans for the future. She would sweep
and scrub, and dust, and potter about to kill time
until the boss and the men were gone. After
which she would tackle the washing; and that
was as far forward as she had the heart to look
just then.
In pursuance of this decision, on the third day
of her career as working housekeeper, she was
scrubbing out the office when she came
accidentally on a bottle of brandy—kept forsick-
rleßS. Mrs f Winkles wasn’t feeling very well just
at the moment, so she tried a dose of it. She was
so favorably impressed with the mollifying 1-esult
that she took three more doses in five minutes;
She felt so happy then that she siing a lullaby to
the scrubbing brush, and even joked about the
proS p ect i V e infant. Her courage also revived,
and all the difficulties of house-Work began to
vanish. She scrubbed industriously for awhile,
refreshed her flagging energies again, scrubbed
R P“dically a little longer took more stimu-
lants—and finally fell over the bucket. Soon
afterwards Selina found her lying on her back
in a pool of muddy water, tobacco ashes and
loose matches strewn about her, and all her
pristine splendor gone. In disgust she went
to the men, and those worthies carried-her to her
room, commenting that they had never thought
she was a woman of that sort, took off her wet
garments, and put her to bed—a proceeding that
so shocked the modest Selina that she threatened
to give notice first thing in the morning.
Mrs. Winkles slept off the effects of her debauch
in the course of the afternoon, and, at dusk,
arrayed in a pink petticoat, slipped over to the
hut, looking, as Scully said, like a walking night-
mare,
“ By cripes, this is a nice caper you’ve got me
at,” she grumbled, dropping on to a bunk. “I’ve
disgraced me manhood.”
“Excuse me, Mrs. Winkles,” said Jim. “It
wasn’t stipulated in the agreement that you were
to make an alcoholic receptacle of yourself.”
“You’ve belied me an’ Mrs. Gater, who re-
commended y’r,” said Tarkalson, sorrowfully.
•“ What’ll Toby say when he hears of it ? ”
“ My troubles about Toby ! ” Mrs. Winkles
snapped. “ I’ni full of it. Look’ere ” —striking
a melodramatic attitude, “There’s sewin’ an’
mendin’ an’ darnin’ to no ,end, an’ toggery to
make for a blamed baby wot ain’t ’apppnpd yet.
It’s got me fair flummoxed, I ain’t equal to the
situation. Mo!” she went on, tragically, “J
ain’t built that way. An’ Selina suspicions some-
thing, too, or she thinks I ain’t quite respectable.
Stuck in the room talking to me last night when
I wanted to get me nightgown on—which is th’
only comfortable thing I’ve got to wear. Had th’
blouse half undone, holdin’ it, when a darned
beetle hooked me in the neck. I made a grab at
th’ beast, an’ me blessed bust falls off. Had to
own up then as I padded. S’lina seemed to be
thinkin’ a lot when she left me.”
“Phew!” said Tarkalson, “you’re too chicken-
hearted.”
Mrs. Winkles shook her head deprecatingly.
“We ain’t doin’ th’ fair thing by Selina,” she
declared. “She embarrasses me th’ way she
talks.”
“Well, that won’t make you blush, will it?”
said Jim.
“ I do, gunbust me if I don’t. I warn’t meant
for a woman, Jim, an’ ’taint fair to hoodwink
S’lina ”
She stopped short, with a violent start, and the
pipe dropped from her mouth. Toby Carson
stood in the doorway, looking as cross as two
sticks. He had not been expected home till the
morrow.
“ Are you Mrs. Winkles ?” he asked in an awful
voice.
“I—l am!” said the lady who smoked and
wore a pink petticoat, avoiding his eye.
A moment of dreadful silence, everybody wait-
ing breathlessly. Toby shoved his hat back, and
pulled it forward again. Then he coughed.
“ I wished to tell yon that Mrs. Carson has
changed her mind, and is coming back with a
companion ; so we’ll be able to dispense with your
services.”
“Very well!” said Mrs. Winkles, squirming
under his glance.
“ I’ll pay you a week’s wages in the morning,”
he concluded, turning away.

Blacksmith Once.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHERE the Fatmen hold their orgies,
lo ! I dine in state to-night.
Far from the blazing forges where the
clanking Titans smite.
1 here are women fair beside me, and my lips are
wet with wine ;
There is ne’er a joy denied me, and the earth’s
best gifts are mine,
There’s a band distilling gladness from the hearts
of violins,
And the harps are slaving sadness as they prate
of sweet, red sins ;
But I turn from the feast and ponder, and ni3 r
lips make no response,
lor I think of the days back yonder, when I was
a blacksmith once !
I hey are talking books and drama, but my
thoughts are far away,
W here the anvils shake and clamor, and the great
cranes groan and sway !
Where the mighty fans are roaring, and the oily
shafting rolls ;
Where the fierce red flames are soaring from the
blazing coke and coals.
I stand with the sweat-stained toilers away in the
past again,
’Midst hissing steam, and boilers with plates and
valves a-strain.
I stand like a man among them, as 1 stood in the
years gone by,
’Midst the cranes—how I toiled and swung them
with their flaming freight on high !
I remember the night-shifts grafting, and the bad
old songs we sang,
Midst the roar of the rumbling shafting and the
hammers’ clank and clang !
Lo ! the boys ran for the beer then, and we drank
in a Vulcan’s way,
And my blood ran strong and clear then when I
drew my hard-won pay.
I remember those gladsome pay-days, when I
thought the cheques sublime
That I earned in those toiling heydays when I
worked much overtime.
Now I earn as much in a morning as I made in a
long week then,
But I turn from my ink in scorning, and I hate
this clerk-like pen !
I wish I were forging steel yet—l wish I were
there again;
Do the anvils clang a reel yet?—They are silent
now and slain.
Twas a man’s grim occupation—’twas a good old
roaring trade,
When we drove the new-born nation up the steep
industrial grade.
But the old shop’s used for storing the machines
made over-sea—
Have the forges ceased their roaring for all
Eternity ?
I know that I’ll lift the hammer when the great
fires blaze once more—
When the midnight Nasmyths clamor in a new
industrial war !
Where the Fatmen hold their orgies, lo ! I dine in
state to-night;
But I think of the silent forges where the Titans
still should smite !
There are women fair beside me, and my lips are
wet with wine,
But my inclinations guide me where the smith-
shop fires should shine !
There’s a band distilling gladness from the hearts
of the violins,
But my soul is filled with sadness o’er our legis-
lators’ sins.
So I turn from the feast and ponder—does Aus-
tralia make response ?
For I yearn to be toiling yonder, where I was a
blacksmith once !

JOAN HEATHERBELLE’S ROMANCE.
POST stood in the centre of a huge
patch of moss, about two feet above the
Rangitata high-water line. Above it had
been planted ■ willows, and a barbed-wire fence
kept it from the contamination of being rubbed
and polished by cattle. The picnic party wan-
dered in little groups down from the gold grove,
in which we were holding our Christmas revels, to
gaze upon it, and then returned to the shade from
the fierce midsummer sun, and talked and argued
vehemently about Joan Heatherbelle. The dis-
cussion grew warm, and the girls appealed to
Forrester to tell the whole story. A weary-look-
ing young man, dressed in a knickerbocker suit,
surmounted by a stock and scarf of palest prim-
rose, deposited himself on the softest and most
beautiful patch of moss, pillowed his head in
Dorothy Osborne’s lap, and commenced :
“ That post marks the spot where Joan Heather-
belle’s army crossed the Rangitata to attack Peel
Forest. How Joan Heatherbelle came to have an
army, and why she wanted to attack Peel Forest,
which is altogether too lovely a spot to be dese-
crated by a sanguinary ‘scrap,’ is one of those
picturesque incidents of our romantic past which
have been carefully suppressed out of a misguided
respect for the gentlemen who painted the back
years in such lurid tints. However, most of them
ha/e now gone under, and even beautiful Joan
Heatherbelle herself has joined Cleopatra, Zeno-
bia, and all the other lovely ladies who will
brighten up Valhalla for us in the eternity to
come, so I think the story ought to be put in the
school books.
Far up the gorge of this river, this Rangitata,
where the divided waters gush out from the Great
and Little Glaciers respectively and meet to form
the main river, is Mesopotamia Station. That
was the home of Joan Heatherbelle. Although so
far off the beaten track, at the extreme end of a
road that stopped abruptly at the foot of a wall of
indigo-tinted ice, 300 feet high, it was, and is, a
charming place to live. From her front balcony
windows Joan Heatherbelle looked down the
wild, picturesque gorge of the Rangitata, the
wide turquoise stream rolling between vast shingle
drifts that suggested the idea of a raging storm
at sea suddenly transformed into gray rock.
North, south, and west were the Alps, their bases
skirted with the purple forest, red-veined with the
rata fire. A place to rave about, an enchanted
land made more weird by its fearful and unutter-
able loneliness.
* * * *
“ Flie Messiter family had been a turbulent
crowd from its youth, and the older it grew the
worse it got. In those days it was located at
Dunsandel station, but Mrs. Messiter married old
Captain Hardinge, of Peel Forest, and when he
died he left everything to her. She never lifted
her head after his death, and followed him to
Geraldine cemetery inside ten weeks, leaving the
three sons to divide the property as they thought
fit.
“They divided it in a unique fashion, which
was at least cheap and expeditious. They met in
the old captain’s smoking-room, and with a basin
and three dice threw for Peel Forest on the
understanding that the one who got it forfeited
his share in Dunsandel. Arthur Messiter threw
two sixes and a five. The ones counted, Yankee
grab fashion, as sevens, and Roland threw two
ones and a two, while Percy could do no better
than turn up a miserable trio of fours. Thus Arthur
Messiter became the owner of Peel Forest.
“The second week he was in possession Joan
Heatherbelle and her husband called in (they
always used to put up at the Forest on their way
to and from Christchurch); and right there, at first
sight, Arthur Messiter became hopelessly in love
with Joan Heatherbelle. He was not the first
to do so, but he really seems to have been the
first who seriously proposed to take her away
from her ridiculously happy husband.
“First he proposed to her that she should elope
with him, and when she treated it as a rather bad
joke he got so vehement that she asked her
husband to take her home at once. It was a
bit awkward too, for they had come down
specially to attend a week’s festivity, tennis
tournaments, hare-shooting, and beagle-trailing,
and all that sort of thing. And it was hard to
find an excuse for leaving so abruptly, but they
found one, and left early the morning after
Messiter’s declaration. He had kept his passion
bottled up for nearly 12 months, and when it
did break out it shook Canterbury considerably;
for immediately they were clear of the carriage-
drive Arthur Messiter took to drink, and in his
cups told the whole story. .His party broke up
with startling suddenness.
“ He sobered up at the end of the week, and
found stirring things were happening. Otago

HE (moodily): “I never shoved her till she
put her tongue out at me.”
had refused to unify, and wanted a Federal
Constitution, or to continue under the provin-
cial district and superintendent system, or some
other foolishness. It spoke contemptuously of
all the other provinces as ‘lame ducks,’ and
declared that they wanted to batten on its
prosperity ; and, finally, it threatened to resort
to arms to preserve its ‘glorious liberty.’ In
Dunedin, and all the country towns too, they
were holding noisy public meetings. Wild, hairy
men in kilts, who called everything ‘ she,’ foamed
at the mouth while they delivered fiery speeches
in Gaelic, and made savage references to Bannock-
burn and Stirling, and one enthusiastic ‘chiel’
actually ran through the North-East Valley dis-
trict of Dunedin with a fiery cross, calling the
people to arms against the ‘Southrons o’ the
North.’ Several fowl-houses got burned down
through sparks from the warlike emblem, and
the police stopped his progress, but liberated him
after extinguishing his ‘ cross.’
“As most of you know, the squattocracy of
Canterbury was not too keen on unification,
but if the old order had to go they were for unifi-
cation. Anyhow, they hated the Scotchmen and
gold-seekers of the southern province with a fierce
hatred. But the men in knickerbockers held no
meetings, and said never a word in public. They
had no time to talk, they were too busy acting.
One morning vociferous Otago woke up to find
hovering along the northern bank of the Waitaki,
the boundary between the two provinces, a cloud
of mounted riflemen, which daily grew larger as
each squatter came in with his men, accom-
panied by waggons loaded up with supplies.
What rifles they had in Otago were of the antique
Minie type, while the Canterbury shooters were
to a man armed with the deadly Snider.
“ Then Otago began to climb down, but for the
best part of a month that force hung there ready
for a raid, talking of the loot of Dunedin, and
chafing at the delay. Then came orders from
Auckland to disband, and all in a day the Canter-
bury army disappeared from the banks of the
wild Waitaki, and was swallowed up in the roll-
ing tussock from which it had emerged so sud-
denly.
“ But the effect of that swift, noiseless mobili-
sation remained for years. It showed that the
feudal spirit our people aimed at was an actuality.
It intensified the bond between us and our people,
and our fathers knew for the fh’st time that their
dependents would follow them to anything. Also
it showed how strong was pastoral Canterbury,
for when the Central Government, such as it was,
was paralysed wondering what to do next, Can-
terbury was ready to deliver a crushing blow.
“ In that mobilisation the dependents of Gobi
Creek, Dunsandel and Peel Forest were com-
manded by Arthur Messiter, for Roland was in
the North, and Percy in the horrors.
“On the way back he fell in with Ingram
Heatherbelle, who was marching his men home
again in a state of bitter disappointment. He
rode up beside the master of Mesopotamia and
held out his hand.
“Ingram Heatherbelle looked at it coldly, and
then in a sudden burst of sympathy for the man
whose love for his wife was so hopeless, shook it.
“ ‘ I’m sorry it blew over, Mesopotamia. A
stray bullet might have decided between us, and
have either removed you or given me peace.’
“‘lt’s foolish to give way to the emotions,
Messiter. For my own part, I’m glad there’s to
be no bloodshed. It’s bad enough fighting the
Maories, but white man against white man would
have been too horrible.’
“‘Well, look here, Mesopotamia, give me a
show. I’ll tell you what I’ll do with you. I’ll
fight you, to a finish of course—rifles or pistols,
and if Igo down you take Peel Forest. If you go
down I take the lady. If I can’t get her I’d
sooner be dead.’
“ ‘ Messiter, you’re as mad as a November hare.
If I didn’t,think your brain was turned, I’d kill
you where you stand for proposing such a thing.
You’re drunk, you idiot! ’
“ ‘Then you won’t fight?’ said Messiter.
“ ‘ Certainly not. Risk my life and my wife’s
happiness to oblige you ! Damme ! this is too
much.’
“Then the other squatters present dragged
Messiter away and restrained the angry gentle-
man from Mesopotamia, and the incident was
apparently forgotten. Arthur Messiter sent the
Dunsandel and Gobi Creek men home under their
overseers, and took his own back to Peel Forest.
“ That he had formed the idea of carrying off
the beautiful lady by force is proved by his subse-
quent actions. It was hard to get the men back
to regular toil again. Their hearts were far away
at the loot of Dunedin, and Arthur Messiter
treated his men to bullocks roasted whole and
hogsheads of home brew.
“ And all the while, up on an almost inaccessible
portion of the main spur of Mt. Peel, hidden
deep in the forest, he
was building a tiny lodge
where he would cage his
pretty bird when he had
caught her. It was a
place that a handful of
men could have held
against a thousand, and
a secret path that wound
over the track of recur-
rent land-slips provided
for escape should the
place ever become un-
tenable. There was a
wonderful lot of method
in Messiter’s madness.
“It was mustering
time, and Heatherbelle
and all his men were out
on the ranges gathering
in the hill merinos. At
Mesopotamia were only
the ordinary domestics,
and the aged gardener
and the young groom
were the only men about
the place. Mrs. Heather-
belle had cantered down
to the ‘ Meeting of the
Waters ’ to see if there
was any sign of her hus-
band on the distant hills.
On Mt. Horeb he
always lit a bonfire
when he was returning,
and the pillar of smoke
ascending against the
blue sky told the joyful
news that he would be
home in time for dinner.
She sat on her horse at
the point where the two
streams rush together,
with her eyes fixed on
the distant peak.
“ Suddenly the groom
exclaimed, ‘ Here they
are, madam !’ and point-
ed with his crop to a
long line of horsemen
struggling down the
Giant Drift. Mrs.
Heatherbelle shaded her
eyes with her hand, for
the sunlight danced be-
wilderingly on the grey
shingle, and saw that the
men were armed.

they are armed. They couldn’t be robbers, could
they, Morgan ?’
“ ‘Lord save us ! No, madam ; never heard of
robbers in these parts, though they have them,
and murderers too, down where the gold-seekers
and Scotchmen are. The gentlemen of Canter-
bury wouldn't allow such scum in these parts.’
“‘ I think we’ll go home, anyhow, Morgan, I
hope they will pass by without calling.’
“ ‘Well, madam, there goes the master’s signal
on the mountain, so he’ll be home to dinner, an’
we can bluff ’em off till he arrives, even if they’re
no good. We’ll get the guns out of the house, so
that the master will be able to deal with them
when he comes if they’re bad ’uns, madam.’
“Half an hour later those horsemen had sur-
rounded Mesopotamia homestead, and were
searching for the arms, which they were assured
had been taken to the hills by the men in the
hope of meeting with pigs. On* Mt. Horeb the
smoke was rising like the fumes from a young-
volcano, and Messiter and his men were disquieted
by it. So in less than an hour from their arrival
they were on their way back, with Mrs. Heather-
belle and her favorite maid in their midst,
prisoners.
■V * * *
“The last rays of the setting sun, reflected
from the snow-clad sides of Mt. Somers, lay in
golden bars across the blue waves and shingle
ridges, and then suddenly faded into gray twi-
light as Heatherbelle caught sight of the Peel
Forest men resting at the water’s edge. In a
moment he saw the disadvantage of their position ;
all he had to do was to slip past and seize the
shingle ridge below them, and he had them caught
between the ridge and the impassable torrent.
“ The Peel Forest men mounted leisurely. The
crash of the boulders had drowned the noise of
the galloping of the men of Mesopotamia, and if
there had been any way of escape they would
have bolted precipitately when the order to throw
up their hands came across the shingle drift.
“‘Put up your hands, you ruffians, or we’ll
shoot every one of you like dogs, blast you ! ”
“‘Trapped like rats, by heavens!’ shouted
Messiter. ‘ Dismount men, and keep your horses
in front of you.’ Then he placed his hands to his
mouth and shouted at the top of his voice above
the roaring of the waters and the crash of
boulders :
“ ‘ls that you, Mesopotamia?’
“‘Hand over my wife and her maid and you
can go free ! ’ shouted a voice from behind the
shingle ridge.
“‘Heap up the shingle in front of yourselves
while I talk, if you don’t want to be shot,’ yelled
Messiter to his men.
“ ‘Say, Mesopotamia, will you fight a duel now,
and save bloodshed ? ’ called Messiter again and
again till they caught his meaning.
“ ‘No, I’ve got you trapped, and I’ll wipe out
the whole gang of you if you don’t liberate Mrs.
Heatherbelle and her maid immediately.’
“‘Well, wipe us out, if you’re able,’ said
Messiter, suddenly
dropping into a
shingle hole after
directing Mrs.
Heatherbelle to take
up a position out of
the line of fire.
“From the shingle
ridge camered flashes,
and a sulphurous
smoke drifted down
on the men from
Peel Forest. In the
midst of it they heard
their horses scream-
ing, and cursed as
they realised that even
if they got out of the
trap a 40-miles’ walk
lay before them.
“‘Don’t shoot till
someone shows, and
then let him have it
all together ; they
mean business right
enough. Pass the
word ! ’ said Messiter
to the nearest man,
who passed the order
along, for the Peel
F orest men were
shooting indiscrimi-
nately, and their am-
munition supply was
limited.
“The twilight
deepened, and neither
side gave way, and it
looked as though it would come to a wild scuffle
amid the shingle drifts in the darkness, which
both leaders were anxious to avoid.
Get ready to storm the ridge, men ! ’ snorted
Arthur Messiter at last in despair. ‘ Count from
the left, and odd numbers follow me. Even num-
bers cover our advance, and for God’s sake shoot
straight. Bo you understand, blast you ? ’
“‘Never mind blasting, boss! You show the
way—it’s your woman we’re scrappin’ over—an’
we’ll follow you,’ said a sour voice from down
the line.
“‘All right, Jenkins, I’ll lead you. Now
listen to me. When I whistle, the coverers
cease firing, and then we’ll rush the ridge. Let
’em have it close, and then club the guns!
Understand, my bully boys?’
“‘Yes, sir! Aye, aye, boss!’
“ The coverers did as they were bid. The
storm of bullets that swept over the crest of the
drift sent the shingle flying in all directions,
and the bark and rattle of those 20 rifles
drowned even the roar of the river, for the high
terraces reverberated the sound again and again
till a man a mile away would have thought two
armies were fighting a battle.
“Suddenly the whistle sounded, and the shoot-
ing stopped. As the men of Mesopotamia poked
their heads over the ridge to see what was doing
they met the rush of the stormers, who fired a
volley at close quarters and then with a shout
rushed with their rifles clubbed.
“Taken by surprise when they believed they
had the abductors at their mercy, the men of
Mesopotamia broke and fled to their horses, but
there were some who lay along the crest of the
drift and made no effort to escape. And as he
glanced at them Messiter clutched at his throat.
The stormers did not fire on the men who were
running as fast as the shingle would let them to
the safety of another drift, but bent down over
the huddled forms and suddenly realised that
murder had been done.
“ Then the coverers rushed up and Arthur Mes-
siter, looking round for Mrs. Heatlierbelle, saw
her galloping along the water’s edge to where her
men were gathered on the crest of the distant
drift.
“‘Let her go—she’s cost too much already!’
said Messiter, gloomily, with his hands pressed
tightly against his jaws. ‘ Are these fellows all
dead—why, good Lord, we haven’t lost a man ! ’
“Then lie went from one huddled form to
another, till, at the end of the line, he found
Ingram Heatherbelle’s corpse, shot through the
head. Sudden tear fell on him. He sprang to his
feet and started off at a run.
“‘Come on, let’s get out of this. They can
look after their own wounded,’ he shouted,
trailing his rifle and striding towards where the
moss made easier travelling.
“Swearing and making ghastly references to
the hangman, his men struggled after him. All
night they toiled down that awful river-bed, and
morning found them still 20 miles from home, and
utterly exhausted. They shot some hill merinos
and breakfasted, and after a rest resumed their
march. Late in the afternoon they reached Peel
Forest. Next day they killed another bullock
and roasted it whole, and waited to see what
would happen. But the world seemed to go on
just the same, and continued to do so for a
week.
“Then news came. One of the hands who had
not participated in the raid ventured abroad, and at
the Ferry Hotel heard that Joan Heatlierbelle
had come down the northern bank of the river,
and was begging men from the stations with
which to attack Peel Forest and avenge her
husband. Christchurch was far away, and it
might be weeks before the Law could get a move
on, and when it did it would borrow men from
the stations, place them under the command of a
police inspector, and proceed to arrest the ‘ gang.’
Meanwhile, the gang might make itself scarce.
“ A week of burning summer weather had
turned millions of tons of snow into water. The
glacier-fed Rangitata was running a banker, and
Arthur Messiter, looking down on the raging
torrent, told his men it would be a fortnight
before Joan Heatlierbelle and her men could
cross, and then they would retire into the forest
fastnesses of Mt. Peel and defy pursuit. So they
went back to the homestead and gave themselves
up to another week of home brew.
“ With the men of Fernleigh, Rangihape, Al-
ford Forest, Rangitata, Ocean Caves, and half-a-
dozen other smaller stations behind her, Joan
Heatlierbelle came down to the northern terrace
and looked on the flooded river. Her greatest
dread was that she might be too late, and she had
sworn to hang Arthur Messiter on the highest tree

in his own grounds. The beautiful, lovable woman
of a fortnight previously was turned into a blood-
thirsty fury. The gentlemen with her tried to
calm her, assuring her that it would be at least
ten days before they could cross, and even then they
might lose half their men. She didn’t care if they
lost all of them so long as Arthur Messiter came
to his just doom.
“All the evening she walked up and down in
front of her tent, thinking, planning, how that
river might be mossed. Then she called one of
her own men to her.
“ ‘ Could you swim that river with a rope made
fast to you, Waldon ? ’
“Waldon looked at it, pursed his lips, and
thought hard.
“‘No, m’m. But I could get across all right
if I had a cork belt. You see, while it’s a banker
there’s no danger bein’ caught in the boulders,
but I might get twisted up in a rope, m’m.’
“ ‘I know you could, but I want you to have a
line so that we can get a wire rope across, and
when you’ve made it fast we can cross in a basket
or box running on it, like the boat at the ferry,
you know.’
THE COMING COSTUME.
Recently the Manly Council passed a resolution that ladies’ surf costumes must be of a dark
material. The artist expects the results to be most satisfactory, as shown above.
“A look of intense cunning came into Waldon’s
face.
“ 1 It’s as easy as gettin’ drunk, m’m. Let some
’un hold a reel of string, with one end tied to me,
and we can get a life-belt from the ferry, and
I’ll take it across, m’m, an’ we’ll have that Mes-
siter bloke ’ung ’fore breakfast.’
“ ‘ If you get across, Waldon, I’ll give you £lOO
and 50 acres of the Dest land on Mesopotamia.’
“‘Give me what you like, but I’ll do it for
nothing to see you righted.’
“She wrung his hand. Then he went off on
horseback to get the lifebelt and the strong
twine.
“By daybreak Joan Heatherbelle’s ‘army’
was standing at the water’s edge to see Donald
Waldon make his attempt. He was in a singlet
and drawers, with tennis shoes on his feet, and
the cork jacket fitted like a glove. He got be-
tween two floats, made of wood, securely held
apart by fencing standards bolted on, and Eric
Thornleigh, of Ocean Caves, held the reel of
twine as he got between his floats, and was
whirled away by the racing current.
“Never did desperate enterprise seem so easy.
Like a bullet from a rifle he was shot towards
the opposite bank and hurled up on the shingle
with such force that his breath was knocked
out of him, and he lay still, temporarily
stunned. When he staggered to his feet a great
shout went up from the northern bank, and he
made the twine fast to his float, and went off
towards the houses at the ferry to get a spade
and assistance.
“He was back under the hour, with a dozen
men. They brought the Post, made it secure,
hauled over the clothes-line, and by it dragged
over a wire rope. Then the men came swinging
across in a box, and by mid-day the whole force
was across.
“They did not advance straight across the
naked plain on to the homestead, but marched up
the river-bed and made a four-mile detour through
the forest, so as to come out opposite the back
door of the homestead. Joan Heatherbelle rec-
koned rightly that if the homestead could not be
defended Messiter and his men would retreat to
the forest, and once in the bush there would be
some awful fighting before they would be cap-
tured. Messiter’s success at storming the shingle
drift had inspired the attacking force with a
wholesome respect for his generalship, and the
prowess of his men. Still, they had no hope
against this crowd, which outnumbered any force
Peel Forest could raise by at least four to one.
“From the edge of the bush they could look
across a paddock full of splendid horses, but a
high hedge hid the stables, and a belt of trees lay
between the stables and the house.
“ They advanced to the hedge. Men were
moving about the stables. Two boys were driving
a long string of cows across a clover paddock to
the byre. The blue smoke curled up from the
chimneys of the homestead in the afternoon sun,
and it was a picture of peace.
“It was 400 yards from the hedge to the
stables, and another 200 to the homestead itself.
If the defenders were on the alert they could wipe
out the attacking force in that space from the
plantations. So the force made another detour
and dribbled across out of sight of the stables and
the byre, and actually reached the kitchen garden
before the alarm was given.
“In spite of wild shooting the house was
surrounded, and Messiter and his men were caught
without the shadow of a chance of escape. Joan
Heatherbelle, her full red lips drawn tight, her
black eyes gleaming like diamonds, a cloth hat
pinned down on her raven hair, wanted to offer
an amnesty to the men on condition they handed
over Arthur Messiter. The-squatters with her
were afraid they had no power to make such a
bargain ; the legal authorities might not recognise
it. Still, they were willing to pledge themselves
to do their best to secure lenient treatment.
Then they decided on another offer.
‘ ‘ They would allow the men to march out, pro-
viding, of course, they gave up their leader; but
the men rejected the offer, fearing treachery. So
in the end the attack was commenced, but almost
immediately a white flag was hoisted, and a man
called out that Arthur Messiter had committed
suicide.
“They handed his body over to four of the
attacking party, and waited. Joan Heatherbelle’s
army withdrew, and left the coast clear for the
Peel Forest men to make their escape. Not a
squatter among them wanted the men punished
for obeying the orders of their feudal chief, and
the Peel Forest retainers streamed away down to
the stables, mounted all the best horses, and
scattered over the face of the country.
“When Joan Heatherbelle rode away from
Peel Forest, the blood-thirst had died out of her.
A broken-hearted woman drifted away to Christ-
church, and thence to England, and was never
heard of in Canterbury again, after she parted
with Mesopotamia.”
* * * *
Then Forrester sat up, and looked dreamily
towards where The Post stood amidst its moss.
The bars of golden sunlight he spoke of were
already falling across the Rangitata, and the gray
shingle cliffs, and the musical roar of the waters,
seemed to sing of the vanity of it all. And we
set to work to boil the forgotten billy in silence,
each one thinking hard of dead and gone Joan
Heatherbelle and the men who loved her.

The Girl in the Undertaker's.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DAILY to iny work I go
Through a thoroughfare of woe.
Backwash of the human flood—
Mire and misery and mud
Fill its lanes from end to end.
Britain’s patient Mongol friend
Plies his trade among the houses
Where the “ girls ” with loosened blouses,
Sprawling on the door-steps, cry
“ Ducky !” as I pass them by
(Fact! I always pass them by);
Afghans, Syrians, and Chinks
Fill the place with monstrous stinks.
Women with uncanny hair
In the wine shops sit and stare ;
Here the Jew with heavy nose
Spreads for sale his cast-off clo’es ;
There, upreared among them all,
Stands a mouldering hospital,
Emblem unto them and me
Of their final destiny.
Not yet told is every den
In this street of ghoulish men.
There are shops where skulls and bones
May be bought, or got as loans,
Where the cod-eyed salesman fusses
With cork legs, and splints, and trusses ;
I forgot the tombstone-maker’s,
And the black, black undertaker’s,
Where the very door-posts are
Dark as night without a star.
Past that undertaker’s pane
Day by day I walk again ;
Every day its black despair
Chills my skin and thrills my hair ;
Yet each day my eyes I turn
To its coffin and its urn,
For at morn and eve a Face is
In that gloomiest of places.
That dark setting, drear and dead,
That black shell of shuddering dread,
Holds a ruby—opal—pearl;
’Tis the Undertaker’s Girl.
Glossy hair and scarlet lip
Gleam from out the coffin’s grip.
Sombre eyes my own eyes meet
As I loiter in the street.
So I linger as I pass
That broad sheet of black-rimmed glass,
Near her sits her master grim
(Ghastly is the face of him)
Writing with a busy pen
Names of dead and dying men,
Lists of graves where rank weeds grow,
Dull advertisements of woe.
Urn and coffin bid me dream
Of death-beds where widows scream,
Of the graveyard’s sodden clay
Where the corpses waste away,
Groaning ghouls that sate by night
Their unholy appetite;
Little worms of loathly red
Fattening fast upon the dead ;
Women racked by fatal pains,
Poor dead babies thrown in lanes,
Drownings, murders, matricides,
Horrors that the gaol-yard hides;
Cancers growing inch by inch,
Strong men in consumption’s clinch—
All these gifts by Nature sent
Pay the coffin-maker’s rent.
But the girl’s face brings to me
Dreams of sweet Persephone,
Gazing with her tender eyes
At the world’s long sacrifice.
While the dead men lie at rest,
By her lips and cheeks caressed.
Ever is her scarlet mouth
Icy yet in Hell’s hot drouth.
Through men’s clay the fat worms creep ;
Safe with her their spirits sleep.
One day it will fall that I
(Possibly some aunt may die)
Shall walk in to parley there
With the girl with glossy hair,
Stammer at her ’mid the room’s
Awful caskets, dreadful plumes.
Shall I sting her lips to fire,
Wake in her the earth’s desire ?
Or, when on my own it lies,
Will her full, sweet mouth of ice
Bid me slumber e’en as these
Touched by pajle Persephone's >

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BOY, of the sad and sombre slum begotten,
Who danceth at an end of dirty cotton,
While at the other soars weird colored paper,
O, chuck it, for it is a dangerous caper !
0, sturdy offspring of this southern clime,
I’ve walked against that cotton many a time
(It is so hard to see) and lost my hat—
But, nipper, chuck it not because of that !
Nor yet because “ Milk-oh” may knock thee down
And dash like lightning o’er yon hill to town ;
Nor yet because thine agile feet are bare
That tread the metal of the road’s repair.
Nor e’en because the chucked-out wreck, who lies
Close by upon his back, with bleary eyes
May view that soaring colored thing with pain,
Quite certain that he has “ got them again.”
Chuck it, O nipper ! Let the dashed thing go !
The habit’s fatal. Don’t we old ’uns know !
Chuck it, because it poisons, withers, blights—
Thy native land hath flown too many kites !

Flood-Time.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I expect it is the dry weather that has set
me remembering the flood-time. My mind
always did work by contraries.
I was at the University, going in for an Arts
degree—not that I ever expected to get it, be-
cause, of course, such a deal may happen in three
years. It’s a perfect lifetime. I was having not
half a bad time there, and really working pretty
hard one way and another—mostly another—but
the time came when I thought a change would do
me good. You see, a man at Barnabas’s had been
getting rather attentive ; in fact, we danced 18
times together one night, and the next evening he
sat for a solid hour on the fence at the bottom of
the garden singing “ Annie Laurie” with tears in
his voice (my name is—or was—Anne Elizabeth
Clayton—Nan for use); so when Clara Carioll,
one of the second-year medicals, asked me to come
home with her for the Long Vacation, I accepted
with pleasure, and we went north together. Carrol-
side (that was the name of their station) wasn’t
half a bad place, though to a town girl like me it
felt 7000 miles from everywhere. Mrs. Carroll
was a dear old thing, very religious, and always
trying to read to us out of queer, stuffy books on
Sundays, and there was a sort of uncle person
who talked very loud and spent all his time
running after the sheep and things, but
there was the sweetest manager you ever saw,
down from somewhere up the Gulf way where he’d
caught malaria. He’d come to Carrolside to get
rid of it. Tim Butler his name was, and he’d the
loveliest blue eyes and more sunburn than malaria
about him, it seemed to me, and I should have
enjoyed myself thoroughly if it hadn't been for
that little cat Clara. It’s an awful confession to
make, but I can’t ride any more than I can fly
I’m not like those lovely girls in books who casta
spell over the entire animal world, or at least mine
is the wrong kind of spell. I never had the
slightest influence on a horse any more than if he’d
been a bathing-machine, which I often wished he
were, and that wretch Clara knew it. No sooner
were we recovered from our journey than she pro-
posed a ride for the very next morning, and Mr.
Butler was only too pleased—l think he’d been
pretty well bored with Mrs. Carroll and the
uncle—so there was nothing for it but to take my-
self into my habit and smother my wrath. One
comfort was, I looked all right.
“ Something quiet, please,” I said when they
brought the horses round, and there was Clara
feeding them with raw vegetables and letting them
slobber all over her gloves.
“Don’t be frightened, Nan,” she called out,
“ there’s old Ginger for you. He’s nearly twenty-
five. A baby might ride him.”
Mr. Butler mounted
us, and off we went, and
I really began to feel
almost comfortable
when what must Clara
do but start off gallop-
ing. The aged Ginger
hated being left behind,
so he galloped too,
starting with a horrid
bump, so that half my
hairpins fell out. When
I tried to stop myself
from bobbing all over
the saddle by pulling
at the reins he got
angry, and stuck his
head down and made a
noise like a steam en-
gine. What with me
upsetting him and him
upsetting me, we'd got
all behind the others,
and there was I left to
do lonely battle with a
wild though middle-
aged horse. Ido believe
he came to bucking be-
fore he’d done ; any-
how, the most extra-
ordinary things hap-
pened underneath me.
I knew what 1 was
doing just roaring
with fright and expect-
ing every moment to be
sent flying over his
hateful old head—when
suddenly a voice said,
“Are you in difficul-
ties, Miss Clayton ? ”
and there was that
blessed Mr. Butler with
his hand on Ginger’s
rein. It was rather a
silly question for him
to .ask, as I was a pal-
pable wreck, but I w r as
so rejoiced to see him
beside me that I nearly
fell on his neck. He
went home with me in
spite of all Clara’s
mocking remarks, and
that evening, after dinner, when I took him out
into the garden and explained matters to him,
he seemed perfectly satisfied. But we must get
along to the flood.
If I’d really considered what the climate of
Queensland was like in the summer I doubt if I
should have gone there, in spite of the Barnabas
man. The most terrific things can happen there
all in a moment and without giving you time so
much as to wink. The river was quite half-a-inile
from Oarrolside and lying along meek as a lamb in
its deep bed. Talking of lambs reminds me how
one day I took a walk with Clara —we were friends
for the moment and Mr. Butler was out cattling
or sheeping with the Uncle somehow —and we
found a poor lamb very ill in a gully. Of course I
thought she, being a second year medical, would
kill it with enjoyment, instead of which she wept
and wailed. She went right back to the yard
where Mr. Butler was, leaving me to mount guard
over the lamb, and said to him “There’s a 1-lamb
in the g-gully and I c-can’t k-kill it,” and he came
prancing along with her to where the lamb was,
and picked it up, and took it round the corner
somewhere, and brought it back directly after, as
nice a little corpse as you could desire. Then
Clara said she’d like to dissect it if he’d carry it
home for her, and she kept it on the verandah two
days because she forgot all aboutit, and then wehad
to bury it in the garden, and Mr. Meyriek from
Wonga Wonga came over with his terriers and they
smelt it —which wasn’t surprising—and dug it up,
and there was the most awful to-do. I wouldn’t
be a medical for worlds.
But, goodness me, this isn’t the flood.
Well, one day the clouds gathered up out of a
clear sky, just like Elijah made them in the Ora-
torio, black as your hat, and a most terrific wind
began to blow all in a moment, and every drop of
rain in the heavens fell out at once. We were
watching the lightning—at least I was, for Clara
put a cushion over her face, and Mrs. Carroll said
the Kingdom of God was at hand and got right
under the bed—when the wash-house roof went
fleeting by the window, and then the hail choked
the shoots, and the water began pouring in every-
where, and a lump of ceiling flopped right into
the piano. After a bit the lightning stopped, but
the rain kept at it like evex-ything. For three
mortal days it simply teemed in sheets with
thunderstorms between—only there was no be-
tween—and I spent the time packing all my
things and getting them up to the coekloft. The
rain came in there too, so they had to come down
again, and Mr. Butler was as nice as possible
about helping me to find a dry place. We got into
the queerest holes in our seareh —in fact, we spent
one whole morning in the woodshed, and Clara
was simply mad at lunch.
Carrolside hall went right up to the roof, with
great rafters across it high up instead of a ceiling
like the smaller rooms. On the whole, it was the
driest place in the house, so we made a sort of
camp there and biought out our beds, Mrs.
Carroll’s, which was as big as a church and all
tied up with blue ribbon, in one corner, and
Clara’s, and my little one. Where the men slept
I’m sure I don’t know ; they were out at all hours
of the day and night looking after the stock, and
we used to cook them hot things to eat and drink
when they came in drenched to the skin. On the
third day Mr. Butler told us the river was up, and
just beginning to flow over its banks, and by the
middle of that day the floods were out. It
stopped raining about then at Carrolside, but I
suppose it kept on somewhere close, for the water
THE BLUSHFUL RELATIVE.
“ But surely, aunt, you’re not going to bathe with your spectacles on? ”
“ My dear, I won't take off another thing!”
got higher and higher. Mrs. Carroll said we
should look for the bow in the cloud according to
promise, but by the afternoon there wasn’t a cloud
to put a bow on, and yet the water was rising.
Next morning you could see nothing but water
all round for miles, with dismal trees sticking out
here and there, and a hill or two covered with all
kinds of creatures. About 10 o’clock the men
brought in a lot of ropes and pulleys, and began rig-
ging them up across the rafters. Then they fastened
the ropes to the beds, and told us to get on them!
“The water’s at the door now,” said Mr.
Butler, “and if you don’t look jolly sharp you’ll
get caught.”
So we mounted our beds and they pulled us
l ight up, six feet and more off the floor, and as
they fastened the last rope there came a trickle of
water like a snake across the floor, and in five
minutes it was all under water. They planted the
piano on the big table, and then splashed off to
try and get a boat in case things got worse. The
water came up at an awful rate. You went to
sleep a bit, or looked out of a window, and there it
was up to the table edge or the mantelpiece. The
piano was takgn with the most extraordinary
bubblings as the water got into it, and the furni-
ture, after floating about a long time, came all
unstuck, even to those little lumps of wood they,
put in chairs where you don’t loolc. I told Clara
it must be just like a dissecting-room, arms and
legs roaming about separate, but she said it smelt
a good deal better. They brought us things to
eat from time to time ; I know I ate a whole
tinned tongue, but really there was nothing else
to do. Jim had a few words with me every time
he came in, which made Clara mad as a hornet,
but the last time he could only just get in at the
door on the tips of his toes and his head came
bobbing along like a eocoanut.
“I shan’t be in again for a bit,” he said;
“ we’ve to take the boat over to Morrison’s and
get them off the roof—their house is going—but
you’re in no danger here.”
“Oh, we’re as jolly as sandboys,” I said, but
my heart went right down, I don’t know where, to
see him go. After that I tried fishing with my
shoe, and as near as anything fell off the bed, and
Clara told me not to be an idiot, and Mrs. Carroll
said it was no time to be trifling with death. It
got dark horribly soon, and the queerest dim
wavy light came in at the windows, as if we’d
been at the bottom of the sea. The clock struck
nine all of a sudden right down under the water
though it had stopped for hours, and I was quite
glad when Mrs. Carroll said she thought it would
be well to lift our hearts to Heaven—l know mine
was in my boots. She prayed a splendid pray, all
full of Thee’s and Thou’s and Noah’s ark and Moses
in the bulrushes and the Sea of Galilee, and right
in the middle she shrieked out loud. I leaped
about three feet into the air.
“Is it an alligator?” I screamed, and she re-
plied in quavering tones, “The water is up to the
bed-valance!” We forgot to finish the prayer,
though I’m sure I never in my life felt more need
of it. Clara began to cry and say we should be
drowned like rats in a drain, and I got frightfully
hungry, like people do when they’re lost in caves
and catacombs and eat their boots and candles
before they’re so much as due to have afternoon
tea. It was a horrid night. I slept a bit, but
every time 1 reached my hand down the water
was nearer. Oh how glad we were, as soon
as ever it was light, to hear the boat bumping
against the wall outside, and to see Jim peering
in at the window. He had to swim in to us this
time, for the water was up to the top of the
door, and he said we must come right out and go
in the boat to Wonga Wonga. Clara wasted no
time in talking. She just put her arms round
his neck and flopped overboard, and he ran her
out under the doorway in the cleverest style, and
they pulled her into the boat. Then he came
back for me, but I said Mrs. Carroll ought to go
first. However, she wouldn't hear of it. I’m
sure she felt like the captain who is the last to
leave the bridge, very heroic and grand, and that
cheered her up immenselv, though you can’t
imagine how funny she looked with blue streaks
all down her face from the wet ribbons of her
bed. I mayn’t be able to ride, but I can swim a
bit, so I kicked off my
skirt and shoes and
lowered myself into the
water, and Jim gave me
a hand at the doorway,
and I was out and in
the boat in no time,
without so much as
making my hair wet,
whereas Clara looked
like a drowned rat.
Then I watched
through the window to
see how he’d manage
with Mrs. Carroll. She
sat on the side of the
bed and talked a lot
about “sweet fields be-
yond the swelling
floods,” and “linger
shivering on the brink,”
and all the time Jim
kept saying “Now,
Mrs. Carroll! ” and
“Come, Mrs. Carroll !”
and persuading her
nearer and nearer to the
edge. I suppose he per-
suaded her a bit too far,
for she’d just got to
“linger shiv—” when
she slipped sideways
and rolled right over,
and sat down on his
head in the water claw-
ing at the bedclothes
and screaming. They
both went right under
and bobbed like two
whales. Mrs. Carroll
tried to scramble back
on to the bed, but Jim
headed her off. Then
she made a grab at his
neck, and, getting her
hands on thedoor-ledg< ■,
refused to let go. She
kept saying: “Lord,
now lettest Thou Thy
servant depart in
peace,” and her legs
floated straight out in
front of her through the
doorway. Jim got be-
hind her and unloosed
her hands and ducked
her under, and as she
came spluttering up the
other side the men in
the boat got hold of her
and hauled her in. She
said the bitterness of
death was past, and
“This is indeed the
end ! ” and went off in
a sort of faint.
That was indeed the end of the adventures so
far as we were concerned, for we got over to
Wonga Wojiga without the least trouble, and tin!
flood all went down in a week. Clara took a fancy
to the Meyrick son, so she and 1 made friends
again, and, when the time came, travelled back to
the University like two lovebirds. But I never
took my Arts degrees after all. I took Jim in-
stead.

The Love of Luke Devine.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FROM Port Augusta and the sea —through
Pichi Richi Pass,
Where the air’s like wine of Capri, and the
sun’s like molten glass ;
To Quorn, where railway lines go South, and
North to Hergott Springs,
And where the loud Salvation Army screams of
harps and wings;
The man from Oodnadatta weeps, while with the
blade unkeen
The barber saws his beard
and wishes for a lawn-
machine.
He says the Army tunes
are worse than wire
upon the blade;
They set the customers
on edge, and spoil the
barber’s trade;
And when they tire of
brassy shriek (which
takes them over long)
They scare the seraphim
away by deafening
them with song.
From twilight dim to
midnight black they
frighten off the morn,
The rimbomboso din of the
Salvationists of Quorn.
“ Slickin’ to ther right !
Clingin’ to ther fight!
Lookin’ out ter catch ther
lovin’ smile er Jesers;
Lookin’ out ter catch ther
smile er Jesers—naow
Ther smile—er Jesers—
naow! ”
Bim !! ! Bom !!! !
“Bom” was the drum that
spoke its little piece
of verse the last;
“ Naow ” was the wail of
Luke Devine to bolt
his crime-stained past.
He had been a tombstone
canvasser, and told
full many a lie
To sell the granite angel to
the man about to die ;
And now, in half a fear
the Evil One would have him yet,
To save his soul he blew it through a B-flat
clarionette.
And yet, not all for his boul was he the Army’s
kin and kith—
’Twas more of love for the sausage curls of Soldier-
Sister Smith.
His weak chin-whiskers clogged the keys, the
levers caught his hair,
And in his sinful pride he played the notes that
were not there.
When he caught her eye he blew a blast like a
maniac’s dying shriek—
A note that gave each child in Quorn a nightmare
for a week.
When he got the chance in a raucous hymn to put
in shakes and trills
He did; and the bloated euphonium man gave
him the look that kills ;
Gave him the look of two of a trade when one
does the thing that’s good—
A mixture of snaky hatred and the sympathy of
wood.
The euphonium man was a beast of tongues and
proudly told his sins—
Piracy ! Arson ! Murder ! (for the greatest liar
wins),
Simony ! Forgery ! Smoking ! Beer ! and the
very deadly crime
Of stealing pence from a blind man (and he told
the truth that time).
His little eyes rolled round with pride as he spoke
each awful myth,
And held by his crimes, as by a spell, was Soldier-
Sister Smith.
Her sausage curls shook each with fear. Her pale-
green eyes began
To shine as the euphonium fraud rehearsed the
Crimes of Man !
Her breastless figure seemed to swell; as she
turned to Luke Devine,
She seemed to say: “Till you have sinned like
him I’ll not be thine.”
He pleaded, after meeting, he’d been good since
he was born ;
He’d helped the poor and hastened the millennium
of Quorn.
Said she : “ You know not woman’s heart. ’Tis
wrong that you be mine
Unless you be a sinner. So, God help you, Luke
Devine ! ”
They were the three, you’ll understand, who
formed the Army’s van—
The clarionette, the tambourine, the fat euphonium
man.
They were the three who dared the Devil forth to
meet them there,
For all the other soldiers only shone in bleating
prayer.
Some for the chance to thrill had joined, and two
of them had come
To wear the uniform; and one that he might
smite the drum ;
And Sister Smith, that she might win a soul and
lose herself;
And the soul she sought was masculine, for she
was on the shelf.
Also an audience she sought that she might talk
of death,
Of hell, and other cheerful themes and the
drunkard’s dying breath—
Of how he turned his head in fear and wept frm
bitterly
When he saw a variegated fiend play euchre in a
tree ;
Of how his fantods got him, and he put his hand
upon
One Sankey’s hymns, and blamed them for his
downfall, and was gone !!
THE DESCENT OF MAN.
ABORIGINAL LADY : “ You married? ”
ORGAN-FIENG: “ Noh, me no marry.”
ABO. LADY : “ Where you get that picanniny,
then? Him just like you!”
Bud Hoskins was his name who made the fat
euphonium sound;
He joined to rise to Brigadier, and rush the band
around ;
From birth he’d had a fixed desire all common toil
to shirk.
He spent his sweat on use-
less play and called it
“holy work.”
From birth he’d been a
loafer, and he had no
brains to think—
He would have died an
infant had the toil been
aught but drink.
He could his future clearly
trace—a year of howl
and bray,
A “commission” in the
city, sweating “chari-
ties” that pay,
The exploiting of 'the
slaves of cant, the
Prison Gate Brigade,
The “ fallen women ”
laundering for nought,
and never stayed,
The piety and sweating
mixed, relieved with—
once a year—
Begged beef and pudding
given in the slums as
“Christmas Cheer,”
The bread upon the waters
that came back by
cent, per cent.,
A thousand times return-
ing in the free adver-
tisement.
Though, secretly, the
slaves to vice they
trebly made enslaved;
Slaves to the past, and
slaves to toil, and the
liberty they craved,
Bread and prayer, and
water and work, and
living by the card,
Paving the sinner’s way
with rocks to make it
more than hard,
Adding to penitence des-
pair, to smoking sins
a flame,
Driving them back from virtue to the easy ways
of shame,
Braying their flesh in a mortar—the flesh of the
gaol and slum,
To fill the purse of their Jew-nosed Pope and to
buy the blatant drum.
And the only man of religion, in that shrieking
red-clothed line,
Was the simple soul who joined for love—the
soldier, Luke Devine !
Now love did make him so distraught, and the
Sister’s scorn did goad,
That he longed for the lion that Samson slew for
his bride on Timnath road !
He planned some featly, deadly deeds with tigers,
wolves, and bears,
And (in his thoughts) he won the prize that is for
him who dares;
He thrashed (by mental
process), to the music
of their screams,
A hundred mad Kana-
kas, and he slew them
in his dreams.
But Sister Smith still
looked askance, and
made no kindly sign,
And he blew his lovesick
soul in flats, did Sol-
dier Luke Devine.
And then she shook her
sausage curls, and
said, “ He’s been
alive !
Has Bud. He killed a
constable in 1895.”
Luke blew a non-existent
bar, nor saw Eupho-
nium
Say by his scowl he
wished the clarion-
ette for ever dumb;
Luke played a “lu-lu-
liety ! ” whose origin
was dim,
And spoiled Bud Hos-
kins’ “Ump-ha” in
the middle of the
hymn.
But Luke forbore to
notice aught —he
fixed his glittering
eye
On Bud, and said: “If
he can kill a trooper,
so can I! ”
So, when the holy Sab-
bath came to shed its
grace on Quorn,
Luke donned his Sunday
jersey, and walked
out to meet the morn.
And he said a prayer of
gladness, and of hope
unto the street,
And walked unto the
station-house a-look-
ing for his meat.
The trooper sat upon his horse—he was a man of
Mars—
A splendid Pagan, sinewed strong, and taut as
iron bars.
Luke bowed him most politely, and greeted with
good will;
And then he said, “ I’m sorry, but a trooper I
have to kill.”
The trooper, laughing scorn, replied, “ I have no
time to die.”
But Luke produced the drum-stick great and hit
him in the eye ;
HONESTY THE BEST POLICY.
DAN : “ No, Jasper, leave it he. I pinched a
shovel once, ’n’ I hadn’t gone a hundred yards
afore a bloke ups 'n' offers me a job. ’Onesty’s
ther best policy, old man.”
The trooper swore and fell on Luke, and sat upon
his head,
And then —he told the coroner that Luke Devine
was dead.
Another blew the B flats in the shrieking red-
clothed line !
And there sped up to highest Heaven the soul of
Luke Devine !
“Pass in ! pass in !” the janitor he said, with a
welcoming smile.
“But I’ve just torn a uniform,” said Luke —all
free from guile.
“ No matter, Luke, your life was good, your place
is here above;
Motives we judge, and not results—you tried to
kill for love.
No! not that way ! The women’s ward ! Your
soul is feminine.”
“It’s the first I ever heard of that,” said little
Luke Devine.
“Who are the gods who tower above—whose
haloes follow them ? ”
“Those are the great of brain who wear the
victor’s anadem !
Shakspeare, and Caesar, and the rest— equal to
all you scan !
Virtue the good of a woman is and genius of a
man.
So get you to the Ladies’ Heaven, and let your
song be learned
To please the great, whose haloes are their genius
left unburned.
You’ll find your mother where you go, and other
of your kith—
Away !”...“ But,” stammered Luke, “ oh ! when
shall I see Sister Smith ?”
The janitor, he sighed as one who has a tale to
tell—
“ For Sister Smith and Hoskins there is no place
out of hell.
But you’re a good and simple soul, and died—a
fool—for love,
And they are calculating sneaks—so rest you here
above.”
But Luke cried out, in anguish dire : “For this I
did not die !
I only played the clarionette ! I will not learn to
fly 1
Don’t talk to me of mother’s love, or any kin or
kith —
For if Bud Hoskins goes to hell, he’ll be with
Sister Smith ! ! ! ”
The janitor said—“ Jealousy is hungrier than the
grave!
Even in heaven you are in hell, because this thing
you crave!
Still must you rest, the ages through, in heaven —
all the same;
But never shall they win here, for they defile The
Name !
So, feed your hunger as you may, and remember
you’re feminine !
Of them the grace that see His face, come to you,
Luke Devine.”
Up in the cold, celestial light, where the great
dead’s genius burns,
The hungry soul of Luke Devine walks up,
and down, and turns ;
Yearning always for worthless things, until his
eyes are wet;
His soul cries out for Sister Smith —but ever above
her set!
Straining his vision to see the smear the world is
from above !
Finding his hell in
heaven because below
on earth’s his love !
At Quorn Bud Hoskins
is captain, and Sister
Smith is cadet.
Her tambourine has
nickel bells, and the
B flat clarionette
Is played by a tattooed
Maori, who is not
Luke’s kin or kith,
But he owns the instru-
ment, and blows
grace notes at Sister
Smith !

“ Tony ” : Here’s a
bush tragedy for some
of your aboriginals to
solve. A few winters
ago a mate and self were
fencing in the ranges
near Beechworth (Vic-
toria). We were accom-
panied by a very large,
tierce kangaroo dog.
When we left work at
night, for home, a dis-
tance of two miles, the
dog was lying at the fire
which vve had lit to boil
our noon quart. We
whistled him up, but as
it was very cold, he
looked up, wagged his
tail and did not follow.
The matter was forgotten
and we did not miss the
dog until next morning.
On going back to our
work we noticed signs of
a fierce fight having
taken place round the
fire. Small bushes were
torn up, and blood was
visible on the chips and grass. We followed
the blood marks into the ranges for about a mile,
and found the dog, or what was left of him, still
alive, but with all the flesh and skin torn off his
back and flanks. In fact, he was almost torn to
pieces. We ended his suffering with the axe, and
tried to solve the mystery, but gave it up. Could
not find any track of a tiger or other large animal.
Have often puzzled my brains over the matter.
What animal could knock out such a dog, and,
when attacked, why did not the dog make
towards home and not in the opposite direction ?
Was the enemy a bird, or several birds, or a devil


The Screen.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN Richard Dicey left his four-
days delirium to join the ruck of his
ill-spent past, he awoke in a new
place—a place of vast white silences and the
sharp, clean odor of some antiseptic he did not
know. Straightway, to the abiding grievances of
his small spirit, he added two or three fresh ones.
For he found that illness stripped him bare of
what he was pleased to call his self-respect;
made, in short, a mere sick animal of him. Instead
of walking proudly—as befits the dominant species,
the heir to all the ages—his physical needs, even
the need of clean water upon the skin, were pre-
sided over by self-possessed young women, as
though he were a cat or a dog. To some wrong-
minded men, the realisation of their absolute un-
importance is very bitter. The calm, business-
like nurses brought this realisation sharply home
to Dicey. They called him (monstrous insult)
“ No. 17.” When in the genial mood which calls
for pet names, they shortened this to “17.”
He disliked the nurses, deciding that they were
masculine. This ruthless method, this labelling
and classification of suffering, was not for any girl
with a spark of sentiment. All vanity ! It is
certainly not nice to be called “17”; to find
oneself regarded as a mere “case” out of a
hundred others ; to feel oneself treated as a
being well-nigh sexless, and, consequently, with-
out personal interest, by any attractive young
woman. Man, for these girls, had lost his mys-
tery. They had seen him at his worst; they had
seen him carved like beef by the surgeons; they
had lost their fear of him. And man, exemplified
by “No. 17,” felt aggrieved. For one has visions,
when the word “ hospital ” is spelled or uttered,
of the magazine-story nurses, who spend their
time soothing the pain-wrung brow with one
touch of their cool, firm hands, who linger like
sorrowing angels round the bedside, and who per-
haps, even, in a gush of loving pity, bend over and
kiss the patient while he sleeps. “No. 17” was
distinctly annoyed that this hospital was not
conducted on such lines. If he were to die, these
girls would not miss a meal on his account, and
irrationally he hated them for it, as though sorrow
for him were one of their duties. That those who
best love and serve the human race are above the
weakness of diffuse and useless sentimentality is
a truth too rarely grasped. Certainly “No. 17”
missed it.
And so this ordinary soul, whose damaged body
had been pitchforked in, by impartial Fortune,
upon the skill of the hospital staff, brooded and
snarled in a bed in which a better man had died a
week before, finding only one thing of importance
in the whole great ward. The nurses wasted their
time at the other beds ; the doctor was not fully
alive to the stupendous issues which were being
fought out in bed 17,
The man in the next bed was a disciple of Mrs.
Baker Eddy, but his faith had proved unequal to
the strain of a general and agonising neuritis. He
was the twin of “ No. 17” in egoism and profound
selfishness, and he took no little pride in his
“hyper-sensitive nervous organisation,” as he
called it, or at times his “highly-strung tempera-
ment.” The two neighbors in adversity had come
in within a week of each other, and the day after
“No. 17” awoke from his delirium, “No. 10”
put forth the idea that the screams of the
meningitis patient at the other end' of the ward
were an outrage. “Keeping the other patients
awake ! Why don’t they give him morphia ?” he
inquired, truculently. To these atrocious senti-
ments “No. 17” subscribed heartily, but in
silence, for he was forbidden to talk.
They were both selfishly relieved, two
days later, when the screams ceased,
and a white screen was drawn
round the unfortunate’s bed.
“No. 17” asked faintly what
this screen was for, and his
neighbor informed him that
it was the signal of approach-
ing death. “Why, can’t
you hear the rattle in his
throat?” he asked. “No.
17 ” did hear it, and
shivered. Still, tli i s
rattle did not disturb
his sleep as had the
screams, and for that
small mercy he was
callously thankful.
But, in the tail of
night lie awoke and
looked down the ward
to the ghastly glimmer
of the screen in the
da,rk, and the rattle, was
still. Two figures whis-
pered together by the
dead man’s bed, and
“No. 17” felt the cold
stir in his hair as he
realised that Death had
smitten so close to him as he
slept. It might have been
himself. How horrible, how un-
speakably sinister was this place
where hundreds of men had died !
Surely, if any place were haunted, this
was. The dark silhouette of a nurse glided
across the pale % background of the screen,
and “No. 17” nearly cried aloud in -'the panic
fear, born of night and sickness, that his
thought had suddenly materialised One from
the unseen. Until dawn he lay glaring at the screen
and imagining the stark thing that lay behind it.
But with the growing light he fell into a deep
sleep, from which he awoke to find the nurse at
his bedside with his breakfast. He glanced down
the ward, but the screen was gone and the bed
was empty, bare to the springs of the mattress,
upon the spirals of which the sun, streaming
across the ward through the high windows,
sketched dazzling little chains of silver. “Is
‘No. 7 ’ . . . dead, nurse?” he whispered, and she
nodded gravely, but without question. He was
disgusted at her lack of feeling ; but he enjoyed
his breakfast all the same.
That night he dreamed of the screen. He
dreamed that it was round his own bed, and that
two stood without and whispered, as they had
done when the soul of the meningitis patient
flickered out into the void. He awoke to find a
wall of white about him, and, screaming, flung
the clothes off him in a great spasm of terror”
i wall was a fold of the sheet
which stood up around his chin. God ! one more
second of it, and he would have died. His heart
was bursting; he lay gasping, listening to the
blood pouring from it as it jumped, pouring
through the channels of his being. How frail,
how terribly frail, seemed the mechanism of the
boc| y- Thump thump thump ! Once that
ceased he would become even as the meningitis
patient, now deep in the earth. He himself—
eight feet underground ! Horrible ! He strove to
turn the current of his thoughts, to get back to the
normal viewpoint, which, suavely illusive, gives
each unit of our hapless race the certainty that
for him will dawn to-morrow. But the stream

of consciousness carried him on, from the last gasp
to the nailing of the boards of the coffin lid ;
from the first slow changes to the horrible
corruption of the warm flesh, of which man is
so fond and proud. The late occupant of bed 7,
symbol of his own mortality, seemed to be calling
him from the earth, pointing the way he must
inevitably go some day, even were his time de-
ferred. As a matter of fact, he was quite wrong
as to “ No. 7’s ” destination ; that unfortu-
nate, having none to claim his body, had gone to
advamce science in the dissecting-room of the
medical school. But the screen had got thoroughly
on “ No. 17’s” nerves, and so he jumped to
morbid conclusions.
Wherefore, when he discovered, next day, that
each bed, his included, had a screen folded by its
head, and that he was lying with that sinister
presence watching and waiting by day and night,
TROUBLE.
“ Muvver says she smack us ef we cwy fer [?]ffing.
En we dunno wot we’re cwying fer Boo-
hoo-hoo.”
the discovery disturbed him in a manner im-
mensely disproportionate to its real merits. For
the next few days he thought of nothing but the
screen—the screen folded, the screen opened
about the death-bed, the glimmer of it in the
dark, and the shadow of the nurse moving across
it to close the staring eyes of that which lay
vvithin. A patch of fresh lcalsomine on the oppo-
site wall took the shape of the terror, and its
angles seemed to change and open to embrace him
in the gathering dusk. All this was not good for
him at all, and his temperature went up. And
this alarmed him again.
It was on the fourth day after “17’s” obsession
that his neighbor relapsed—relapsed hopelessly.
He himself felt worse, for the screen mania was a
wearing one. He was sure, indeed, that his case
was more serious than “No. 16’s.” But the
doctor did not seem impressed by his symptoms.
He was a large, florid doctor, with prominent
eyes, and he smiled in a maddeningly superior
way while “No. 17” detailed his troubles, and
his certainty of approaching death. Then he
said one word, “Rubbish !” A passion of impo-
tent hate against this man’s complacent health
surged up in the brain of “No. 17.” He watched
the doctor bending over bed 16. He watched
him as he passed down the ward. He listened to
catch what the great man whispered to the nurse,
their heads together over temperature charts.
What a farce was this mapping and measuring !
What had the doctor said to him? “Rubbish !”
It was infamous. When he got out he would see
what he could do to get even. He began the
wording of a letter to the paper, a stinging satire
on hospital management. He saw his name
flaunt before a collapsed staff. The doctor's
prominent eyes would become absolutely sessile
with wrath; the nurses would feel, for one
moment, their own callousness and brutality'.
But that “Rubbish!” What exactly had it
meant? He had heard that doctors are never
more off-hand than when their patients are dying.
The doctor might have meant to conceal the
gravity of the case. No man would be so brutal
as to insult the sick. The curt dismissal of his
symptoms assumed a new and serious aspect. He
was certain again that he was about to die, and
he seemed to feel the stir of the screen behind his
head. A muscular spasm, a bed cramp, took his
femoral muscles, and he screamed with the
anguish of it, and the fear that it might be the
beginning of the end. Then the nurse came and
massaged his leg. And she brought a new-tasting
medicine. At this new taste his fears awoke
anew. The terrors of ignorance ! It was a harm-
less sleeping-draught, and in half-an-hour it had
hustled him through the Gate of Ivory.
While “No. 17” slept the doctor and the nurse
came again to bed 16. The doctor made a careful
examination of its unconscious inmate, and his face,
when he turned it to the nurse, expressed resigna-
tion. She questioned him with her eyes. He
shrugged his shoulders. At “No. 17” he gave
one glance. “He can sit up to-morrow, ”he said.
“ But this one .. . And I thought we’d pull him
through. Better get the screen up.” The nurse
went to the head of the bed. “No,” said the
doctor, “never you mind. I want you for an
operation in a few minutes. Tell Casey.”
It was unfortunate that “No. 17” awoke when
he did ; he heard'what he conceived as his death-
warrant. And it was doubly unfortunate that
Casey, the wardsman, having celebrated his
birthday during'the morning, had just enough
drink in him to make him supremely contemptuous
of detail. Trebly unfortunate was it that the
Powers who rule the world found no further use
in it for Richard Dicey. They guided Casey to
his bed, and, while “No. 17” lay, frozen with
horror, the screen shut him out from the view of
his fellows for ever. Recall how he had tortured
himself for the last week; realise his weak spirit—
a spirit, moreover, made more timorous by bodily
suffering—and it will not be impossible to con-
ceive the agony that killed a man in ten minutes.
The fact remains that he died in that brief period.
When the relieving nurse, seeing Casey’s mistake,
rushed up the ward to correct it, it was far past
correction, and that evening two screens glim-
mered in the dusk, each one hiding its dead.
Herein did “No. 17” misunderstand unto in-
justice the soul of the nurse. For she who had
attended him, sitting at her tea that night, sud-
denly put down her cup arid fled, weeping, from
the astonished gaze of her sisters, “My word ! ”
said one, “that selfish little animal in 17 has
given Mabel At all events, she, if
she did not miss a meal on his account,
missed half of one, which, be it said in
all respect to the dead, was more than he had
done for the meningitis patient. And whether it
was the workings of conscience, or some more
external impelling power, Mr. Casqy left his job
with a month’s wages. Even the doctor was
visibly affected, He swore three times, patted
the nurse on the back next day, for he had heard
of her breakdown of the previous evening, and
told her that “these confounded neurotics would
make a saint weep.” Which was a very pretty,
though unintentional, compliment, and left the
girl wondering.
So “17’s” death did make some little differ-
ence, after all. Perhaps more than his life.

The Evening and the Morning.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OH, the evening stole upon us with a foot-
fall light as faery,
With a touch more soft than thistledown
she wrapt us all about ;
Veiled us from the rosy distances, the spaces vast
and aery,
Till the Nightwind stirred the leafage and the
stars came palely out.
Then the wayward Nightwind murmured “ Hush
thee ! Hush thee ! ” to the cricket,
Folded honeybee and beetle, lulled the nestling
of his fears,
Restless till the thrush, unbidden, fluting from
the fragrant thicket,
Pierced our hearts with utter sweetness melting
in a mist of tears.
And the secret of the Silence ever grew more
nearly uttered
As the dove-eyed Gloaming deepened to the
jewelled blaze of Night,
Till from out the scented dusk there came a sound
of wings that fluttered,
Fluttered, silken-soft as moth’s wings ere he
launches him for flight.
Was it but the white owl swooping ? Was it but
the night-wind fleeting?
Nay ! my prisoned heart beat wildly, for I knew
the winged boy.
Then Love lit, and nestled to me, laid his cheek
on my heart’s beating,
Till the silence spake its secret and my heart grew
still for joy.
Did I sleep or wake ? I know not—but I felt
thro’ all my being
You and I alone, beloved, lost together, I and
you,
While the great stars wheeled above us, and the
dark slid by unseeing,
And the moon, in white dreams mantled, drifted—
drifted down the blue.
Unawares, from out the distance came a long-
drawn breath of coolness,
Rippled all the tufted grasses, soughed, and sank
amid the trees.
Shook bright drops from folded roses, emptied
lilies of their fulness,
Caught their garnered scent and idly flung it to
the rising breeze.
Up and up from dim horizons welled the day-
' spring in its whiteness,
Flowing, flooding to the zenith, colorless and clear
and clean ;
Moon and stars went out before it, topmost peaks
put on its brightness,
And the swimming shadows sharpened all its
silvered ways between. '
Then the Morning—ah, the Morning came with
queenly song and laughter,
Stepping radiant from the ocean, crowned with
gladness, robed in light!
Gilded cloudlets trooped before her, and the red
sun followed after,
Rolling up the burnished sky-way in the splendor
of his might.
As the dear dark fled defeated, as we watched the
glad day winning,
You and I alone together, standing glorified, at
gaze,
Caught the triumph of creation, breathed the
bliss of Earth’s beginning,
Knew the Evening and the Morning for our
light-filled First of Days.

“ Gip ” : If anybody offers you a small,
innocent-looking baby wallaby for a pet, decline
him gracefully. I say this in bitterness and
sorrow, as I glue together the few remaining bits
of crockery our pet wallaby has left us. To-day,
in desperation, I took him to a high range in the
wild bush, and explained to him how delightful it
would be to be free, and nibble the green, green
grass in the spring, and by-and-bye have a sweet-
heart of his very own. I kissed his innocent
brow, and hurled a stick miles down into a
gully. The wallaby has been trained to follow-
sticks. He bounded joyfully down the range,
and I ran for home, thinking I had lost him. 1
came in and set the table, but felt like a child
murderer. I turned to attend to the fire, and a
mighty smash amongst the crockery told me the
wallaby had returned, and landed on the
table as usual. Knew a pet wallaby that
caused a loving old married couple to pass each
other by with icy hauteur for a whole week. One
day, to their great grief, this Amiable pet left for
the bush. Twelve months later he appeared in
the cabbage-patch. All hau'ds turned out and
were stationed at given spots round the fence of
the patch. The old couple stood at one end where
a gap occurred, holding out a tarpaulin. They
supposed that when the other members of
the family “shooed,” the wallaby would go
for the gap and jump into the tarpaulin,
thus making his capture easy. He jumped
certainly, but not into the tarpaulin. In-
stead, he struck the bald pate of the head of
the house, knocking him aud his spouse head
foremost into the dust. They said the very
rudest things they knew at each other, and
left the chase of the wallaby to the rest of the
household. His Nibs made for the dining-room,
jumped the table, scattering flowers anfl crockery
in all directions, knocked down the lady-help,
and left her for dead, and escaped through a bed-
room window. He knew the joys of freedom


The Return of Jinny.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.)
ET was the last night of our holiday on
the Dandenong Ranges, and it was as eerie
a one as could be imagined. The wind
whined and whistled among the trees through the
valley with a melancholy moan. The clouds,
which had been heavy and lowering all day, were
still hanging over us threateningly, but no rain
fell. The “weird expectant” feeling was over
everything. The brightly shining, unwinking eyes
dotted over the mountain sides came out one by
one earlier than usual —the mountain folk were as
glad to shut out the creepy night as we were.
Even the “ding-dong” of the cowbells jarred as
they rang out with unusual sharpness and clear-
ness, and Ginger, the house-dog, smelt and whined
around the house unceasingly, now and then
barking violently at nothing to relieve himself.
We were glad to settle cosily in front of the
huge fire our host, old man Brown, had built in
the comfortable kitchen. Even the insatiable
Dick jibbed on turning out to go to the dance up
at the “Mechanics,” though it was the last. The
old lady had gone off to bed early with a head-
ache, full of vexation —dear old soul —because it
was our last night, and she thought it would offend
us. The old man quietly produced whisky, and
with our pipes we made gallant efforts to shake
off the outside gloom.
There was no lamp burn-
ing, but none was wanted.
The jolly firelight lit up
with a brilliant glow the
little dresser, with its
shining array of pottery and
polished tins ; its flickerings
made a gay laurel-crowned
“Bobs” wink leeringly, and
lit up tenderly a vile por-
trait monstrosity of “our
eldest boy what died when
he was a baby,” cherished
in a home-made fern frame.
It lit up, too, the walls,
home - papered with odd-
ments of paperhangers’ pat-
terns, and the low news-
papered ceiling. It showed
a long shelf running the
length of the room, holding
the old couple’s store of
home-made jams, soap and
candles, and bunches of
herbs drying along the
edge; also the clean bare
floor and table, and the only
article of luxury the house-
hold boasted—a battered,
comfortable, little “rocker,”
the missus’s particular pro-
perty.
Dick and I understood
Tinny had done the batter-
ing in one of her tantrums.
We’d often heard of Jinny
during our month’s sojourn
in this little mountain home,
and Jinny had come to be
our nightmare as well as
that of the old couple.
She was their grand-
daughter. ruling them with
a rod of iron, and throwing
things about if anything
didn’t please her. At
present she was in service
down town, and the prin-
cipal prayer of old man
Brown and his wife was
that she would remain there
for ever. But that idea
was too good to build on,
for she periodically took
fits of laziness and dumped
herself on the old Browns
for indefinite periods, doing
nothing all the time, but
literally sweeping the house
with them.
For all the glowing cheer-
fulness of the fire and
the whisky, the spirit of
the night crept in and
crushed conviviality, and at last Dick turned in,
yawning. After listening to a few more reminis-
cences concerning the bitenoir Jinny, which had
become pretty tearful since the advent of the
whisky, I followed.
* * * *
After tossing some time and listening to Dick’s
powerful nasal trumpeting, I fell into a heavy,
dreamless sleep. I don’t know how long I had slept,
but suddenly I realized that I was broad awake,
bathed in sweat, and glaring into the inky dark-
ness, shivering at the uncanny stillness and quiet-
ness of everything.
“Did you hear that?” grunted Dick’s voice out
of the opaqueness, from the other side of the
room.
“ What?”
“Listen!”
Straining our ears, we lay still, absorbing the
death-like silence. Suddenly it came again—a
faint, distant cry. We kept quiet, wondering
what on earth Ginger was about to let it pass
unchallenged.
There it was again, shrill and clear.
“Why, it’s a coo-ee,” said Dick, hounding out
of his bed and going to the window.
There was a stir in the back part of the cottage,
and the old man’s voice was heard, sounding
husky and troubled. He was waking the old
woman.
“ Hannah, Hannah, there’s .Tinny ; there’s
Jinny calling, down at the sliprails ! Han-
nah ”
A wail of anguish rose. We hardly recognised
our jovial old hostess in the troubled voice.
“ Oh, dear Lord ! Jinny, Jinny’s come ! Oh,
dear Lord ! What shall we do ? Oh, Mr. Dick,
here’s Jinny come home,” she wailed.
“Well, what the devil can I do about it?”
muttered Dick to me, under his breath, as we
jumped out.
“We’re coming, Mrs. Brown,” 1 shouted, when
the passage door that shut off our part of the
house was closed with a decided bang, and we
could hear old Brown remonstrating with his
wife. Then the wailing ceased.
“Not wanted,” said Dick, trying to peer out of
the window, ■“but it’s rummy, ain’t it? There’s
old Brou n going out after her.”
There was a long quietness after this, broken
only by Mrs. Brown’s heavy footfalls in the
kitchen and a moaning cry every now and again.
Presently there was a bustle of arrival. Ginger
excitedly barked. Voices became nearer—a
strange, shrill, argumentative one mingling with
the gruff tones of old Brown.
“ Jinny’s angry,” said Dick, rolling himself up
in his blanket again.
“Who’s with you? Are you by yourself?”
quavered the grandmother, going out at the hack to
meet them. Then another door banged, and all
that came to us was an excited, distant roar, the
new-comer’s shrill voice predominating. It seemed
hours as we lay listening. There was some heavy
banging around, and once a mighty crash of
broken crockery, and amidst it all was a rattle of
the frying pan. Presently there was a louder
bang than ever
“ Oh, I say, I can’t stand this any longer,” said
Dick. “ It’s currish to leave a helpless old couple
at the mercy of a great, coarse virago like that.
Just hear the way she’s banging about.”
Our door creaked softly just then, and old
Brown crept in, bringing with him a whiff of
bacon and eggs.
“ I hope you gents ain’t been annoyed,” lie said
apologetically. “ But I thought I’d come and tell
yer, Jinny’s come home.”
“Oh, is that Jinny? ” said Dick.
“Do you want any help?” said I.
“Oh no,” he said. “She’s a bit put out at not
being met at tlie station, and she’s a bit hungry,
but she’s in rather a good temper. I hope
you won’t be disturbed no more. We ain’t going
to tell her as how we’ve got you two gents as
lodgers, until she’s got a bit more peaceful-like,
’cause, yer see, this is the room she’s always had
when she’s been up here, and she might turn
nasty.”
Just then the vixenish voice rose once more,
and with a muttered groan and curse, he hurried
off.
“So we re likely to be rooted out of our beds
by the vixen. By gum ! we’ll tackle her if she
comes, and before we clear out to-morrow she’ll
hear something,” said Dick, with grim determina-
tion.
“ Ain’t it awful, though, to think that a great
thing like that can come up here half tight, and
bully the old couple in this lonely hole, even if
she is a relation ? They’re a couple of jackasses
to stand it.”
“ I wondered what that shed full of broken
furniture and things out at the back meant, I
said. “My God, what a life! Listen! there’s
the rain. I bet it’ll spoil all chance of that
gully view on our way to-morrow.”
After a silence, Dick spoke again: “Perhaps,
on second thoughts, you’d better pitch into the
cat to-morrow. You’ve the most tact, Bill.
* • * *
Coming back from a wash at the icy mountain
spring, down among the ferns, next morning, we
came in by the kitchen entrance, expecting to see
old Mrs. Brown bustling around getting breakfast
as usual. Dick was on ahead, and his open-
mouthed look of wonder when we got in was a
sight to see. I was soon in a line with him.
Moving about the kitchen, deftly setting the
table, was a slim slip of a girl, neatly and trimly
attired. Mrs. Brown turned a heated face from
the eternal frying-pan to welcome us as we came
in.
“This is my grand-daughter, Jinny, come to
help her old grandmother, haven’t you, Jinny
she said, doubtfully. Jinny bowed modestly and
demurely. She was dark, and held a dainty little
head erect and straight. Also, she had deep, un-
fathomable eyes that penetrated you through and
through, and then demurely drooped again.
“Yes,” said old Brown, coming in at that in-
stant with a jug of frothing milk; “it’s a pity
you’re going to-day. Jinny can play the accordeon
beautiful. I’m afraid it’s been a bit dull for you.”
Again the girl gave us a brief, impenetrable
glance as she flitted about. It wasn’t possible to
believe that this was the raging sliemale of the
night before, and yet there was a certain anxious
deference in the way the old couple addressed
her. Nobody made any allusion to the night’s
breakage and disturbance, and we tried bravely to
draw out Jinny, but never got anything beyond a
meek, soft “yes” or “no” and the deep, inscrut-
able flash of the brown eyes.
“ Well, I’m hanged ! ’’ said Dick, when we went
in to finish our packing.
“ Shall we two toss up which shall tackle the
‘ great coarse virago ’ before we leave ? ”
“ Don’t believe it teas her. That little wisp of
a girl wouldn’t have it in her.”
“ You forget that eye.”
We said good-bye to the Browns at the gate.
Our intended sledge-hammer reproof tt> Jinny
died away on our lips. It would have been a
flagrant insult to the girl’s smallness and dainti-
ness to attempt such a thing. Dick did mumble
something about taking great care of the old
folks, and I could have sworn there was a mocking
gleam in the dark eyes, but Jinny answered
quietly enough.
“ What a lot of idiotic notions some people can
get into their heads at night,” said Dick, medi-
tatively, as we turned down the mountain path,
our knapsacks on our backs. A long, weird, mock-
ing peal of laughter came ringing down from above
us, and we heard dishes breaking.
“She’s a regular little demon,” said Dick,
shuddering. “ I never could bear those leechy-
eyed girls.”

The Blonde.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
STRAIGHT from my loosened arms he rode
to her
Whose hair is hateful black !
Bitter is love to us, but bitterer
The woman’s endless lack.
Who has not in her something of the Night
Tangled and woven for a man’s delight—
The mystery of darkness and its might.
Ah me ! the soft, the fond
And ineffective blonde !
They come like honey-bees to us whose hair
Is honey in the sun ;
They taste our sweetness almost unaware —
And their brief love is done !
Too faint and thin our savour is ; they miss
A pang of bitter strangeness in our kiss ;
A lover craves a venom in bis bliss.
Boys love us, as boys can ;
We cannot bold a man.
The women with the sunset in their hair,
Whose heads and hearts are flame,
A smouldering fierceness in their veins declare
That men must fiercely tame.
The sunset hair still draws them, as the west
Ever has drawn Man hotly on his quest
To ruddier lands ; these three he loves the best,
These three his proud heart snare —
Red wine, red gold, red hair.
Tasteless the honey got without a sting.
As perfumes new unclose
Upon the dark, the twilight women bring
To Man Night’s sweeter rose.
Our sunshine lulls some hearts awhile, and then
Night with her richer fragrance lures our men ;
They turn not to monotony again,
Our softness they forget—
She holds them—the brunette !
MAOUILANI).
ARTHUR H. ADAMS.
The Girl at the Bar.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
J INHERE were six of us bushwhacking in
the Murchison district, in the South Island
of Maoriland. The cocky we were working
for didn’t see his way to give us something on
account, and, generally speaking, money, as the
financiers say, was tight. Also, we were very dry.
Although we hunted through every bit of cloth-
ing to our names, we could 'only find a couple of
bob, and this was made up of about fifteen coins.
At a sprat a drink it wouldn’t go round.
The only thing for it, as my mate, William
Jones, remarked, was for someone to run the
cutter, lie didn’t mind the two-mile walk each
way, lie said, and if we didn’t trust him we
could send someone along to see fair play. He
suggested that I should be the one to accompany
him. So we started. We had cleaned out the
big potato billy, hoping Miss would open her little
heart. She wasn’t a bad sort of a girl, only she
had an impediment in her speech. It didn’t
show so much when she kept cool, but when she
got excited it came on pretty bad.
She had seen us a couple of times, and rather
liked Bill because he spun her some yarns about his
goings-on at the ’Varsity. He always told these
tales to girls, but I never rightly understood what
Varsity it was, as lie varied a bit in his
reminiscences. We started off, as already men-
tioned, but either the others didn't trust us
or else they couldn’t wait, for when we
got down to the township we found them
on the pub. verandah, having taken a short cut
through the bush. They had run most of the way,
and were breathing hard. But Bill made them
stay outside while we two went in. Miss was in
the bar, and greeted us pleasantly enough, and
Bill handed over the big billy. Then, to my sur-
prise, he whacked down a threepenny and three
coppers. I felt quite ashamed. However, she
took it very well, and really made a very fair show
at filling the billy for Od. We made her laugh
just as she pulled the engine for the last time, and
that may have got us a drop extra.
Everything would have been right enough, but
the others couldn’t bear the sight and the smell of
the beer without the taste, and they all crowded
in and started on it “in the pewter,” as one might
say. It looked a bit off. Miss reared up a good
deal, but she only began to really splutter when,
the beer being finished, Bill, after a long search
through his clothes, produced four pennies and
four ha’pennies, and wanted the vehicle refilled.
She wouldn’t take on the contract till Bill threat-
ened to go across to Mooney’s (the other hotel),
and then, after a lot of argument that seemed to
hurt her more than it did us, she worked the
engine. She didn’t give half as much beer as last
time, and we couldn’t get a laugh out of her
either, but it had to do.
Hearing all the talking, the old chap they kept
as rouseabout peeped in, and, seeing us, he
hobbled away again and brought back some
counter-lunch. There was euough to last out the
beer and a bit over, and when Miss refused to
serve us a third time Bill said she was most un-
reasonable to expect us to eat all those sandwiches
dry. Hut she wouldn’t do the trick, although he
threatened her with Mooney’s again. "Y-you
c-c-can can g-g-go t-t” but Bill pulled me out,
saying it was no place for clergymen’s sons. “Go
round to the kitchen,” he whispered. “You’re
right with the cook. Hurry up some more counter-
lunch.'’ And he crossed the road with the billy.
I told the cook I hadn’t got time to stop, but,
even as it was, Bill was back before me with old
Mooney. He had negotiated sixpenn’orth of beer
from Mooney, and borrowed some glasses, and
brought Mooney across to help drink the beer.
Miss was waving her arms wildly, but her impe-
diment had got her down and she was speechless.
Just then the boss came in with one plate of
sandwiches and one of bread and cheese. He did
look pleased to see seven customers in his bar on
an off-night. “’Evening, Mr. Mooney,” he said.
“ ’Evening, gents.” Then, as his daughter tried
to tell him all about it, he remarked to her, “Oh,
go out and have your St. Vitus’ dance in the kit-
chen.” He handed over the lunch, pulled herout
of the road, and got behind the bar kimself.
“Get out, you soda-water engine,” he said.
“ Now, boys,” he went on, while she had a sort of
a fit on a form in the corner, “drink that up and
have one with me. ’
I never in my life knew a girl wave her arms
about and say * “ g-g-g-g-g g-g-g : g ” as Miss did
then. She was never what you might call friendly
with any of ns again.

Desire.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE two, by a river of ruby wine,
That wound its way where the grass
grew green,
Watched pebbles of gold in the shallows shine
And flash in the eddies that whirled between.
And she by my side was named “ Nineteen ”
The gods had fashioned her glad and fair ;
And her lithe white form could be faintly seen
Through the tossed cascades of her red-gold hair
Her lips were ruddy and ripe and rare,
And the dawn had kissed her on either cheek ;
A living soul in her eyes lay bare,
That glowed and melted and seemed to speak.
Down the darkening distance, hazed and sleek,
The river curved like a bended bow ;
Through shadowed valleys a blood-red streak
That merged in the dead sun’s afterglow.
Then the night came, muffled, with footsteps
slow }
The steel stars glittered by twos and threes,
And, mirrored deep in the river’s flow,
Came the pale moon sailing above the trees.
Clad in white, winding draperies
Came ghosts of the lusts that had died that day,
To drink of the river on bended knees,
And weep, and falter, and fade away.
Ho the hours swooned by to the drowsy lay
That the river rhymed over stope and stone,
Till we slept ’neath the love god’s fevered sway.
With the earth’s warm heartbeats against our
own.
But bitter the wind in the dawn made moan !
Grey ashes were strewn where the wild flowers
grew,
And fair “Nineteen” was a palsied crone,
With thin hair draggled and dank with dew.
And stagnant the river lay, leaden of hue ;
The stones in the shallows like bones bleached
white ;
We stand on the shore in our raiment of rue,
Twin ghosts of desire that died that night.

FRANK HUDSON.
In Ko Ling’s Saloon.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THERE were fifteen men in Ko Ling’s
saloon—traders, beach-combers, broken
sailors, sinners all after their kind, with
the talk of the islands in their mouths, and the
knowledge of strange deaths written on their
keen faces. There was heat in the saloon and
heat without, that nerveless heat spawned up by
a tropic earth to drain the clean honor of their
youth from men, and to sap away body and soul.
The lights of the saloon rocked yellow through
the haze of breath and smoke. Brackstropp—he
was reading a letter written in a woman’s hand,
God knows where—turned the kerosene lamp
higher, with a curse at its dimness. The spurt of
flame burst the globe in a shower of glass that
spun, red-hot, through the room, and a man at
poker in a far corner dashed down his cards and
sprang up, with the blood rushing from a gash on
his neck.
“What—did that? You, Brackstropp? Damn
you ”
Somebody knocked the revolver up before it
spoke. Somebody laughed as a Kanaka girl ran
forward, gathering her yellow draperies away
from her slim, brown limbs to staunch the blood.
Pelham spoke :
“It’s all right, Nick. We ain’t none on us
sech condemned fools as ter want ter hit yer
a-purpose ”
Nick swung the girl aside and stood up
straightly, shaking the dizziness of drink and
opium fumes from him, and a sudden chill caught
the men whose blood had thinned in long years
given to the Pacific. For there was danger in the
young, lawless face, and in the set of the long,
lithe body.
“ Who fooled with my shooting just now ?
Take that, then ! And there’s one for you,
Brackstropp! ’ ’
In the close room the shots rang like a double
clap of thunder. There was a following moment
of silence ; then Pelham sprang past Heriot with
a muttered word, and kicked both lamps over.
All Hell had waited on that moment. It woke
now in a torrent of sound—groans, curses, and
the grate of hurried feet that fought in the dark-
ness. Somewhere the Kanaka girl was shrieking,
and calling on Nick’s name. Then an arm
gripped him about the middle, dragging him out
to the beach, where the blast of salt sea wind
numbed his brain.
He rubbed his hand over his eyes, never striving
to free himself. “Yes,” he said. “Heriot, of
course. What’s to pay, Heriot ? ”
Heriot twisted him by the shoulders, and
looked in his blank face.
“ Too much,” he said. “ You’re marked down
now, Nick. You killed Brackstropp. I saw his
brains on the wall. Can you run for it? The
Bedlamite’s in the roadstead, and Burt won’t go
back on you.”
“ Run ?” said Nick, vaguely. “Run? Why?”
Then Heriot shivered. For sound sprang sud-
denly to life along the scattered village, up the
hill behind, across the tumbled waters of the bay.
The sharp, short Chinese cat-calls and the long
Kanaka howls spread the word that the English
tongue had started ; and to Heriot the thousand
eyes and tongues of Fiji were already strained to
touch this man swaying uncertainly in the road-
way and smiling with a blank bov-face.
“ Come,” he said, and forced the boy down the
beach, along the little pier, and into the bilge of
a dinghy that rocked at the nose of it.
The rowlocks were out, and Heriot cursed the
precious moments lost seeking them. The sweat
dripped off him, and the oars turned in his hands.
Under his feet Nick fell in the sudden sleep of
the dead-drunken, and Heriot laughed as he cast
off and brought the boat round to the full
shoulder-sweep. “You’re too damned fond of
leaving your responsibilities to others, Nickie !
An’ if they happen to pink me instead ”
He snapped his teeth together, and stooped to
the oars as the dinghy labored into the night,
with her nose laid for the Bedlamite outside the
reef.
The plash of a boat taking the water came
behind ; the creak of rowlocks, and the low voices
of men in pursuit. Heriot’s breath sobbed in his
throat, and the nerves of neck and shoulders
tingled like red-hot wires. Far ahead, the black
shape of the Bedlamite swung against the stars.
A quick glance over his shoulder; another, and
yet another ; then a shout answered Heriot’s hail,
and the dinghy came in on a wave-crest, as a rope
spun out from the Bedlamite’s after-deck.
“ Another rope,” yelled Heriot, “with a bight
in it. Look sharp ! There’s shooting behind us.”
A bullet hummed past his shoulder, to hiss into
a wave-top, and the split waves were talking at
the Bedlamite’s cutwater before five minutes had
gone over. A challenge reached them as they ran
past. Captain Burt leaned over the taffrail.
“Schooner Seabird,” he shouted. “Captain
Foster in charge ; owner, Moss of Ulawa. Yes;
goin’ on to Suva. Yes, came in an hour ago.
Good-night.” He turned to Heriot as the lights
dropped away. “ Now, what has that young rip
been doin’ ? ”
Heriot told briefly, looking forward to the black
night, with the whole hideous picture clear before
his eyes ; and Captain Burt listened, chewing his
beard-corners, and making no movement what-
ever. In the ending he said :
“ An’ what hev you to do with it? ”
Heriot laughed—a laugh without any mirth in
it.
“ What d’you think that boy’s going to feel like
when he wakes up ? ”
“ Oh, glory, don’t ask me ! Seasick most like.”
“ He’s wild as the devil,” said Heriot. slowly ;
“ but lie’s not done real harm before. Now ”
“We-ell?”
Heriot looked out to sea. Memory of Nick’s
splendid youth, of his gay smile and frank, daring
eyes were too strong.
“The first time a man eats the blood-red fruit
it sickens him. But lie’ll do it again very like.
And, the second time, it makes him mad. Then
that is the end of all things. I won’t let it come
a second time.”
“ With Nick,” said Burt, knocking out his pipe,
“ you’ve got a Buckley’s hope of saying what you
will or won’t do. It’s what Nick will or won’t do
goes, an’ so 1 tell yer.”
Heriot made no answer. He went below to the
cabin and looked at Nick. The boy lay in the
bunk with the drugged dulness of the opium-
smoker in his half-closed eyes, and his long
body moveless beneath the blankets. His white,
muscular throat was bare, and Heriot, seeing in
fancy the shadow of a rope already across it, got
himself to his bunk in darkness and fear. At day-
break he came up to the poop, caught Burt by the
arm, and drew him out of ear-shot of the man at
the wheel.
“ Nick’s awake,” he said.
“ We-ell ? ” The seaman's eyes fell on the work-
ing face.
“He doesn’t remember a word of it,” said
Heriot, with a half sob; “so help me Bob, not a
first word of it.”
Burt rubbed his nose slowly.
“ I’ve seed that afore,” he said. “ With opium.
I’ve seed ’em forget—till a sudden mem’ry brings
it back wi’ a jump. Yes—l’ve seed that. And—
you telled him, Heriot ? ”
“No.”
“ But you’re goin’ to tell him ? ”
“No.”
Burt did not move. The keen eyes, like needle-
points, were on the other man.
“ He’ll be in danger from someb’dy every hour
of his life if he doesn’t know.”
“ He’ll be in danger of himself every minute if
he does know.”
“ Then ” ?
“I’ll stand guard—so long as I can,” said
Heriot, steadily.
Burt turned, walked over to the wheel, gave
some curt directions, and came back.
“She’s headin’ for Vancouver now,” he said.
“Won’t take me out of my way not so much at
all. I was half thinkin’ of goin’ on direct. An’
some of them States ain’t int’rested in Fijian
affairs, I reckon.”
“Thanks,” said Heriot, and spoke no more
until Nick came on deck, flushed and gay, and
yet uncertain in the tongue.
“Don’t remember taking a ticket last night,”
he asserted, glancing round the broad horizon, and
back to the two grizzled men. “ What’s the ex-
treme penalty for kidnapping, Burt?”
“When a feller smokes opium, an’ drinks
brandy, an’ goes ter sea in a cockboat wi’out
oars,” said Burt, drawing on his imagination
solemnly, “he can’t be expected ter remember
what he was doin’. I couldn’t, myself.”
Nick’s laugh curved the short lip off the white
teeth.
“Opium ? That’s Tiani, then. She coaxed me,
the little ! I’ll get one off her for that.”
“Hope you ain’t in a hurry.” Burt smoked
slowly. “We’re berthin’ next at Vancouver,
Nick.”
“Van” Nick wheeled, meeting Heriot
with angry eyes. “What’s this for?” he de-
manded, and his voice grated. “There’s some
game up here.”
Heriot took his resolution without faltering.
“I’m bunking,” he said. “I got into a row
last night.” Then his grip fell on the boy’s arm.
“Nick, old chap, you’ll stand by me a bit? I’m
afraid—l’m afraid to face it alone.”
The sudden tenderness and pity on the young,
fresh face blurred Burt’s eyes. He swung on his
heel, and Nick said, briefly :
“ You can shake on that. An’l’m not asking
questions, Heriot.”
Burt gave his opinion later to Heriot in one
sentence.
“You’re a man,” he said, “but the plank’s
bound ter slip some day, an’ then you’ll both go
in.”
“ Perhaps,” said Heriot.
* * * *
But it was three years before the plank slipped,
and that was one summer’s day down in Ken-
tucky, when Nick came to tell Heriot about the
girl he loved.
Heriot had not heard of her before. He sat on
his bunk whilst Nick raved through the little
shack with the light of a new glory on his face
and lingering in his broken words. Heriot sat
very still. He was thinking of the plank.
“Yes,” he said. And again, “Yes.” And
then Nick spoke a name that brought him to his
feet, shouting :
“ What ? What did you say her name was ? ”
“Brackstropp. She had a brother killed down
at Aitutaki a few years ago. ’Member seeing
him round Ko Ling’s saloon, Heriot ? Big,
clumsy chap—not like my Virginny ”
His speech halted, dropped silent. The young
face whitened and hardened as he looked at
Heriot cowering back against the rough wall.
“So that’s it,” he said, slowly. “That’s the
trouble that brought you off on the Bedlamite
from Aitutaki. You did it! You! By ,
I’d—l’d like to have the throat out of you for
that! It nearly broke her heart. You slinking”—
Heriot put out both shaking hands to keep him
off.
“Nick ”
Nick towered over him, virile with disgust and
fury and sorrow.
“ Fow /” he said. “ You!... My mate ! And
you let another man swing for it, perhaps. What
did you do it for ? What had he done ? Tell me.
By , you shall tell me ! ”
Heriot spoke uncertainly. He was trying to
think.
“ How much does she know ? ”
“She knows that he was killed. That’s all.
You know the rest. Tell me ! ”
“Oh, my God!” said Heriot in his throat.
Then he spoke levelly, and with his eyes on the
other man.
“There was that night in Ko Ling’s saloon—
hotter than ever, you remember—and you’d been
drinking brandy all the evening. Then you had
half of Brackstropp’s opium-pipe ... and Tiani sat
on your knee, and you were singing ‘ The Tavern
in the Town. ’ Do you remember ? ”
“Yes,” said Nick.
The pupils of his eyes were contracting as
memory took him back to the tawdry heated room,
and the stench of drink, and the noise of quar-
relling men. Heriot watched closely. His foot
was to the plank, and, for the souls of Nick and
the girl out there, he must kick it, though Nick
should go down-stream with it.
“Afterwards you were playing poker with
Chinese Harry and Tombs and another chap.
Brackstropp was reading a letter in a woman’s
hand ”
Nick closed his fingers with a gasp.
“Ah,” he said. “That was where I’d seen
her writing before.”
Heriot suddenly felt very sick. He had seen
that letter just as Pelham stamped the lights out.
, t urn ed up the lamp—and it burst and
th « ss cu j your «eck. Do you remember ? ”
a?™dde»i£4„f &
years had that little hour been forgotten. But
now the plank was slipping very fast.
“ Tiani tried to wipe the blood off your neck,
You pushed her off—and—you loosed your
» ho , ofc e r three times altogether. Then Pelham
kicked over the lamps. You were dead-drunk
when j got you to theboat.”
“Brackstropp?” said Nick, with the blue
changed eyes full on Heriot’s. '
“ I saw his brains on the wall. You must have
se ?P them too. Heriot paused a moment, then
said, with a quick intake of breath. “ You’re
seeing them now !” ’
Nick did not hear, nor heed. His face was
grey and fallen into lines. Heriot passed him,
went out, closing the door gently, and sat on the
btt ! e bd ! ock beyond the shack corner. Some
part of him was praving vaguely; hut there did
not seem anything left to grasp at. For he had
nursed Nick these three years to kill him with his
own hand in the end.
The dews fell. The sugar-maples glowed

over the held of Indian corn and the round hills,

Heriot stood up to see the face that htted this
new voice. And when he saw it in the moonlight
he had no words left.
“ I will tell her,” said Nick ; “and then I will

“A GOVTY
SVBJECT”
BY EDMUND FISHER.
[For The Bulletin.]
j 4 DEAR old girl is Lorna
' f Kerr —
y M One of the very best.
Time was when one fond
word from her
Inflamed my tender breast.
That time has gone, it can’t return,
The passion-fires are out;
But Oil was distressed to learn
? That Lorna had the gout —
Great Cupid’s Dart l the gout!
I hastened to her (Lorna now
Abides with Auntie Kate).
The lines of care are on her brow,
Her charms are out of date.
She shrugged her shoulders as of yore,
She feigned a youthful pout —
One foot she tapped upon the floor.
The other had the gout —
The grim, relentless gout!
She squeezed mu hand ; I did not thrill
Or tremble at the touch.
“ Poor girl 1 ” said I, “ you're looking ill•
Say, does it hurt you much ? ”
She answered tartly : “ Spare your jeers;
Of course, you’re come to flout.”
And then she melted into tears —
“To think of it l The GOUT !
I’m laid up with the gout! ”
She put such pathos in her plaint,
She seemed so much upset,
I spoke some words in accents faint,
Concluding with “ My pet.”
The evening cast a kindly shade
O’er Lorna, flushed and stout;
I kissed once more a fair young maid,
And quite forgot the gout —
We both forgot the gout.
But Auntie came, and broke the spell,
Destroyed it with a glance ;
She lit the lamp ; the curtain fell
On our renewed romance.
The days of youth are short and sweet,
Their dreams admit no doubt ;
Love trips awhile on nimble feet,
And then it gets the gout —
The g-o-u-t gout I

A Song of Revolt.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
y IW ID the demon-haunted vapors from the
| yj | mighty calabash
I can see the ghosts of lodgers waltzing
sadly round the hash,
And the witches sit and mumble, while the weary
phantoms stumble
In the endless dance of sor-
row, as the old landladies
squeak,
“ Poundaweeka—pound-
aweelc! ”
Let the spirits rise and
speak !
So the incantation rises with
the sizzle and the reek !
There’s a lodger lank and hag-
gard, with an old cracked
dinner bell,
Which lie’s ringing, ringing,
ringing, and it soundeth
like a knell,
For the youthful hopes I cher-
ished—which have perish-
ed, perished, perished,
Hopes of girls, and joy, and
comfort, and of bosses mild
and meek,
And of forty bob a week,
Which is all I ever seek,
And it mocks my thirsty pocket
like the murmur of a creek.
There’s a limit to the onion, so
I’m off to climb the fence
Of the Family Traditions, and
abandon Common Sense.
I am going to go a-sailing on the
ocean, where the wailing
Of the fat and flurried phan-
toms comes across the
summer sea.
And I kxiow I’ll laugh
with glee
When they wave their
gamps to me,
All marooned upon the Island
of Respectability.
I regret my aspirations to be rich and fat and
wise,
if rve lifted up the heathen, may I now apolo-
gise ?
Then the top-hat that I gave him, it will surely
never save him
From the missionary’s maxims and the other
things that hurt.
He can stuff the thing with dirt
A’.d his lubra’s kitchen skirt,
Then lie down behind the relic like a hero—in his
shirt.
I care not if I am causing any Proper Person
pain,
For I’m going to let the joyful, primal savage off
the chain.
And I’m going to go a-prowling and a-growling
and a-howling
In a literary jungle where the adjectives are
wild.
And the critic’s bones are piled,
And the tribal teeth are filed.
And each editor’s as simple and as happy as a
child.
There’s a haven for a lodger in a house I know of
old,
And the hash is waiting for him—and it’s getting
very cold.
There the deadly Sins are Seven, and the lamp it
smells to Heaven,
And the slashed and tattered doormat seems to
wear a demon’s grin.
There’s a dark, abysmal bin,
And a tom-cat crammed with sin,
And the tide of hunted lodgers always flowing out
and in.
There they argue on Religion, and on Politics,
and Drink,
On the origin of Species and The Way to Mend
the Sink.
And they wrangle and they chatter while the
dishes’ frantic clatter—
Like the turnstiles into Sheol —drowns the yelping
of the pup.
So the boarders always sup
Till they drain the final cup,
And are wafted into Chaos and Eternal Washing
Up.
I have left it all behind me—l bequeath my share
to you,
All the arguments unfinished and the wild un-
earthly stew,
And the sordid rows and wrangles, and the feed-
ing bell that jangles,
Resurrecting leaping lodgers from each devastated
room,
When, like shadows from the tomb,
They come whirling thro’ the gloom
As if answering the summons of the trumpet-blast
of Doom.
So, farewell ye limpid lodgers with the dinners in
your hair,
For my next abode’s the desert, and the ocean,
and the air.
If you hear a savage banging on a war-drum, or a
twanging
To the thunder of the rollers, ’mid the spindrift
and the spray,
It will be my morning lay,
And the joy-song that I play
On the fiddle I’ve constructed out of Sorrow’s
vertebrie.

A Fresh Start.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ you are Mr. Brown ? ”
The old white-bearded gentleman in
the flowing white gown looked up from
the ledger marked B. 958,382,569 K. 353, which
he had been searching for a recent entry, and
regarded the Shape standing before him.
WIFELY DEVOTTON.
LADY-PICNICKER (on rocks): “Look 'ere, mind wot yer doin’ of! That ain’t no shark, that
ain’t, it’s me ’usband doin’ a swim.”
The Shape was partly bald, and had sideboards.
In one hand it held a frayed belltopper, and in the
other an elderly umbrella.
“ Yes, sir,” it said.
“John Henry Brown?”
“Yes, sir.”
“ Trade ?”
“Greengrocer, sir.”
“ Ah ! ”
The white-bearded old gentleman polished his
spectacles, while Brown, bowed and miserable,
shuffled his feet.
“Well, Brown,” —the Shape shivered at the
sound of the kindly old man’s voice—“l suppose
you don’t know how many times you’ve been here
before ? ”
“Oh, sir,” stammered the Ghost, “I—l never
was here—at least, I can’t ”
“No,” said the old man, a trifle coldly, “I
don’t suppose you can re-
member. Well, I can tell
you that this is your mil-
lioxith appearance before
me ! ”
“ Mine! ”
“Yes. Not of the material
body, you understand, but
of the spirit—the-er essence
—the-er driving power, so
to speak, of the million
fleshly forms it has in-
habited during the same
number of lives. Now, I
am very disappointed in
you.”
“ Oh ! Why sir? ”
“ Not because of the num-
ber of your appearances—
that is merely routine —but
because of the terrible lack
of originality you display.
Brown, have you any idea
of the number of times you
have been a small green-
grocer in a back street ? ”
“ I—l was brought up to
it, sir. My father”
“ Yes, yes; but I was
not referring merely to the
life you have just ended.
Can you ever .recollect a
time in which you did
something different from
throwing vegetables about ?
Did you ever—when dream-
ing or feverish —imagine a
scene in a former existence in which there was
neither the sight nor the smell of a vegetable?
Try and think ! ”
The Shade shook its head mournfully.
“ I thought so ! Brown, I’m sorry to have to
tell you, but you’ve lived a million lives and been
a million greengrocers in a million back streets.
In the Stone Age—which I find was the period
of your commencement—you took up the duties
of grass-gatherer for the tribe, and, from the
habit thus formed of collecting vegetable sub-
stances and distributing them to others of your
kind, your soul has had neither the strength nor
the originality to break. If you were left to
yourself, you would go on in the same rut till the
end of time, but it would be too monotonous a
spectacle. You know the culture of souls is a fine
art. Each successive life is but another distilla-
tion of the same old spirit, and although exalted
station in life is not always an indication of high
soul culture, continued repetition of occupation is
held by the highest authorities to indicate stagna-
tion. That can only be cured by re-casting.
Now, you see that big silver salver behind you ?”
The trembling Shape looked round.
“ Go and stand on it, please.”
The Shape obeyed, and stood facing the old
man.
“Dissolve ! ”
There was a gentle clatter as the umbrella fell
on the edge of the salver and the high hat rolled
into a corner.
In the middle of the tray lay a little heap of
grey dust.
The old gentleman sighed and touched a bell,
the echoes of which had hardly died away before a
boy in a white robe entered, took up the tray, and
waited.
Then said the old gentleman in a tired way :
“ That is a soul of series K 383. I want to
advance it a grade or two from the third-rate
greengrocer division. Better make it a florist or
a hen-fancier. That will do.”
The young man bowed and took out the tray,
after which he returned and removed the hat and
umbrella.

GOULBURN Station ; Cooma train.
Ladies’ carriage; second-class. Seated
on one side two tall thin ladies, with
tightly-drawn-back hair and acidulated lips. In
a corner, girl in cap. Carriage opens into another.
Three young men enter, and take possession of
other. Young men somewhat hilarious. Train
starts. Young men talk. Ladies listen. Ladies
shouldn’t. Awful yarn. Man’s yarn. Young
man explains point. Shocking point. Ladies
move uneasily ; seem agitatedly speechless. Girl
in cap secretly amused.
’Nother young man tells ’notlier yarn. Worse
than the first. Shouts of laughter. Ladies rise
in wrath. G. in C. tries to look shocked, but
grins palpably. Frost in the air. Rather drunken
voice tells quite nice, but somewhat pessimistic,
and utterly pointless, yarn. Yarn received in
silence. Ladies recover equanimity. Settle down.
Rattling of water bottle and glass. Noise like
swallowing. Silence. Second young man, invig-
orated, starts again. Tells frightful, awful,
horrible man’s yarn. Loud laughter. Air
poisonous. G. in C. frankly disgusted. Ladies
furious. Tallest one goes to opening, and addresses
young men. Air tastes like acid. Young men
apologise profusely. Seem really sorry and
ashamed.
Silence. Lowered voices. Rattling of water-
bottle and glass. Second young man begins in
audible whisper, forgets, and speaks louder. Tells
absolutely purple, awfully horrible, terrible man’s
yarn. Roars of laughter. Train stops. Tallest
acidulated lady opens window, fills her lungs, and
screams, “Guard!” Small, dapper man, kind of
official, hurries along. Lady, wildly excited,
makes vindictive complaint. Small, dapper man
enters young men’s carriage. Remonstrates.
Young men murmur. Small, dapper man
laughs. Rattling of water-bottle and glass.
Dapper man gets out, laughing. Train starts.
Jolts rhythmically.
Large, strong young man, hair dishevelled, ap-
pears in doorway, smiling good-naturedly and
waving whisky bottle. “ You ladish cold ! ”
(eyebrows up near his hair). “ Shvery cold, ain’t
it?” (eyebrows normal). “Try a thim’ful, ’slnvon’t
’urt yer ” (confidentially). Train leaps. Strong
young man precipitated on to person of tallest
thin lady. Whisky trickles along carpet. Young
man smiles vacuously at G. in C., but makes no
effort to rise. G. in C. smiles back joyfully.
Second thin lady strikes young man with gamp
and violence. Strong young man sits up firmly
on tallest thin lady’s lap, and playfully wards off
blows with empty whisky bottle. Other young
men enter and forcibly carry off strong young
man. Tell him, disgustedly, “Shony ’arf a
shentleman. ” Strong young man, somewhat
dazed, blinks solemnly. Ladies, looking like
ducky hens, pile luggage in doorway. Large
young man waves whisky bottle over partition in
friendly spirit. Sings happily, but tunelessly,
“ Mary wash a housemaid.” Tallest thin lady,
quite overcome, collapses. Other thin lady hastily
produces flask. G. in G. pants.
“Queanbeyan! Queanbeyan!” Enter three
variegated girleens ; seat themselves facetiously
in young men’s carriage. Bucolic wit smites the
air; girleens giggle. More wit—somewhat fami-
liar. Train starts. Girleens giggle again. Shuf-
fling of feet. More giggles. Silence. ’Nother
sound—smack on the face. Giggles. Whispers.
Same. ’Nother sound. Same ; same ; same.
Peace restored. Thin acidulated ladies, exhausted
and flask-comforted, doze fitfully. Girl in cap
climbs on seat and peeps cautiously over division.
Sighs audibly. Drowses too.
“Cooma ! Cooma ! Coo-o-mah !”

/WAS on the Winsome filly, •
She was riding-guess I —the grey !
We were saying things as silly
As the average lovers say:
“ Was that bow-mouth bought of Cupid ? ”
“Don’t be such an idiot, Sal!
What's the use of ‘talking stupid!"’
So we wrangled, A cheval!
Don't be horrid ! Listen! Linnie !
I have lost my heart to yoxi;
Bet you gloves at half-a-guinea
All the station’s guessed it, too!
Blush again ! Those blushes suit you !
If you look so sweet, I shall !
There ! ” (Come up you clumsy brute, you !)
So I kissed her, A cheval l
Hand in hand, with love confiding
(Perfect manners has the gray,
And the filly I was riding,
Well — she's learning every day!)
“Shall I tell them at the station ?
Shall I tell ? Of course I shall!
Proud to give the intimation:

AN OUTBACK MARRIAGE:
A Story op Australian Life. By A. B. Paterson , author
of “The Man from, Snowy River ” and ‘ ‘ Bio Grande’s
Last Race."
This was printed serially five years ago. “Rolf
Boldrewood” wrote at the time: “The dialect is
simply delicious, and the general descriptions of out-
back life most original and effective.” Since then the
story has been revised and the plot greatly strength-
ened. Price, in cloth, 3/6. Postage, in Australasia,

FAIR GIRLS AND GRAY HORSES,
With Other Verses. By Will IT. Ogilvie.
This edition is printed from new and larger type,
uniform in size and binding with “ The Man from
Snowy River.” The Argus: “There is a faculty for
rhythmical versification displayed on every page, a true
and sympathetic eye for Nature in her many garbs, a
certain careless gaiety of touch in the lighter poems,
and many ballads which strike a simple and genuine
note of feeling. . . In lines full of freshness and vigour,
Mr. Ogilvie seizes upon the picturesque aspects of bush
life. Passing by the monotony and the dreary details,
he sings of the sights and sounds of the camp and the
cattle trail in a strain which inclines his readers to
doubt the assertion that melancholy ever brooded over
the Australian Bush.” Price, in cloth gilt, gilt top, 5/-.

AN ANTHOLOGY OF AUSTRALIAN
VERSE.
Edited by Bertram Stevens.
This volume contains the best verse written by Aus-
tralians, or inspired by Australian scenery and condi-
tions of life. The Editor has explored every available
source, exercising' at the same time great discrimina-
tion, and always subordinating recitation-value to true
poetic feeling.
Mr. Will H. Ogilvie, in the course of an interesting
letter, says Congratulations are due to your editor
for his selection.... At last we shall get away from the
‘ humorously absurd ’ attitude ; at last we shall get
something of the true spirit of Australian poetry.”
Pocket-volume size, printed (in two colors), at the
Glasgow University Press, and daintily bound in cloth
and in limp calf.

1903, and May, 1906 ; also 13 diagrams and 76 plates,
reproduced from special photographs. Tiif, Austral-
asian : “ He has spared no trouble or expense in making
the book first-class. There are nearly 70 pictures of
golfers in every stage of making the various shots. This
is one point in which Soutar’s book excels other books.
They usually give the positions at the commencement
and finish of the shots, and also at the top of the swing,
but Soutar traces the shot all the way round. He also
gives little details apt to be unnoticed, but which are
very valuable.” Price, in cloth gilt, with gilt top,

A Grand BooK,
•VIM and VIGOR.”
Edition to date—three hundred and ninety
thousand —distributed Free by The Dr.
McLaughlin Co., of Australasia.
[Copykightkd].
Allowing five members to a family, there are
in Australasia about one million families. Now
just stop to figure, and see what a tremendous
edition Dr. McLaughlin’s Book has had. It has
gone into 390,000 homes. If it is read by three-
fifths of the family, then it has been perused by
1,700,000 persons. Try to name any other
Australian publication that has attained any-
where near this prominence. We doubt if you
can do so.
The wonderful success of the Dr. McLaughlin
Co. is attributable to their book, “Vim and
Vigor.” It states tlieir claims so thoroughly,
advances their extremely common-sense argu-
ments so lucidly, and puts forth their claims so
candidly that the reader is at once impressed.
There is no doubt but that the great Irish-
American scientist, Dr. M. A. McLaughlin,
has sounded depths far below any'point reached
by other great explorers into the causes and
cures of disease.
All the topics that he treats of are handled in
the plain, simple language that is as readily
understood by the navvy as by the college pro-
fessor. He has treated of all the functional
or organic nerve and blood diseases that come
under the general heading of Debility. The
Nerves, Action of the Organs, cause and effects,
and the cure for Weak Back, General Debility,
Rheumatism, Sciatica, Lumbago, Insomnia,
Epilepsy, Headaches, Stomach and Liver Com-
plaints, Indigestion, Constipation, Bladder, or
Kidney Trouble, Nervousness, and Atrophy
of the Organs.
He tells clearly how he treats each symptom,
how the electric current (which he always
claimed, and of late all leading scientists have
conceded, to be life)' is carried to every ailing
part of the system.
Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt is made in
several different grades, and each is carefully
and thoroughly described in “ Vim and Vigor.”
Thousands of grateful patients have testified
by letters to the company, acknowledging the
benefits received from using the Belt. The
names, letters and photographs of dozens are
given in an album sent out with the Book.
No matter where you live the Company can
give you the names and addresses of numbers of
cured patients in your vicinity.
Letters from people in all classes. From
College Professors, Barristers, Medicos, Jour-
nalists, Carpenters, Bricklayers, and all the
trades. Old men of seventy say they became as
young in spirit as they were at thirty. Men of
fifty say that the past twenty-five years seems
to have slipped from their shoulders. Women
say that the Belt is the only thing that relieved
the misery of their existence. They are all in
accord in proclaiming the Belt the marvel of
the age.
If you have not read their book, you will do
well to send for one at once ; and we are asked
to state that if you are near enough and can do
so, you are invited to call for the book, and at
same time obtain, absolutely without fee and
free of charge, the Advice and Consultation of
their Specialists.
Do not hesitate to obtain their book; it is
free for the asking, and you will thoroughly
appreciate its pages. Call or address the Com-
pany at Suite 7, first floor, 10QW. Market-st.,
Sydney. Their Specialist is in daily attend-
ance ; and, to meet the convenience of numerous
patrons, they are open Wednesday and Satur-
day evenings. Ask for “Vim and Vigor.

Sick and Ailing Men. How does the Xmas
find you ? Are you well, and strong with the
strength of Youth, fit for any duties Life
demands ? If not, remember the Specialists
of the Freeman & Wallace Medical Institute
cure Weak Men, give them Strength and Vital
Power. If you visit Sydney for the Xmas,
call on them. They have a Staff of Four
Qualified Physicians who will advise you Free.
WE do not, like the average physician, treat all kinds of disorders, we treat one
class, MEN’S DISEASES. These we specialise, AND THESE WE
CURE. When a man places his case in our hands he may be sure of three
things, Honesty, Reliability, and Secrecy in practice. These are essential to all men,
whose diseases are of a grave character , and upon the complete
cure of which their happiness and those of others depend. We publish here the
testimonies and portraits of men whom we have cured. Surely the man, hoping and
longing for sound health, desires nothing more in proof. These men can be written to
if need be, or particulars can be furnished quickly by our physicians. When we
say we cure we give a written guarantee to do so. If not, we decline the case, lo
sick men we say call on us or write. Do not delay as it means danger, for the curable
disease may develop into the incurable. In any case of a serious nature to
a man, DR. WALLACE, L.R.C.P., E., L.R.C.S., E., L.M., the Chief Physician,
and who is registered by Medical Boards of Australasia and Great Britain, may
be consulted free of any charge whatever. He and his Staff are renowned for the
rapid and complete cure of all Disorders of Men.
These Testimonies Prove Honesty and Skill.
—♦
Mr. THOMAS J. SMITH, late Sergeant-Major, now Treasurer, Salvation Army, Prahr an - Mel-
bourne (portrait here published), whom we cured and made strong and perfectly healthy, testifies to our
Specialists’ skill in the following splendid manner. He is a man of marked abilities and considerable
organising power, as may be judged by his position. His testimony should be read and remembered by
all men desiring to be cured and to regain lost health and strength. He says:—
a it affords me great pleasure to express my gratitude for the benefit accrued since I resorted to your
specialistic method of treatment. For some twelve years I have been an acute sufferer, the whole
nervous and physical organisation seeming to be involved. lam now cured, and a new man.”
(Signed) THOS. J. SMITH.
Mr. F. Barker, care of Messrs Barker Bros , 262 Victoria-street, Richmond, Melbourne (portrait
here published), who, after unavailing treatment at the hands of several medical men) consulted us and
was cured quickly. He says :
“ | desire to express my gratitude to you, as well as my complete satisfaction, with the results of your
Specialistic Treatment. I was afflicted very gravely. The blood was entirely out of order, and I suffered
acutely. Treatment at the hands of two well-known doctors failed to do me any real gcod.
Fortunately, I was persuaded to undergo a course of your treatment. The results have gratified me almost
beyond expression. Marked improvement was soon manifest. lammw a new man, feeling strong in body
and free from the local disfigurements. From a run-down condition, lam now rescued to sound health.”
F. BARKER.
Testimony from Mr. GEORGE SIMPSON (portrait here published), of Mullawarra, Victoria, whom
we treated for Nerve Weakness. His condition was a desperate one, but we ultimately restored him to
complete health. After detailing his recovery, Mr. Simpson concludes an interesting letter thus
a The last remedies you sent are doing a wonderful amount of good. I am now splendid in health in
every way. I feel that lam cured for good, and I thank you for restoring me to health and strength once
more. lam glad I consulted you.” (Signed) GEORGE SIMPSON.
GEORGE TOWNS, the World’s Champion
Sculler, also says of our treatment: —
“ I underwent a course of your Electro-Medi-
cal treatment. I soon felt better and strong,
confident that I could stand any strain hard and
continuous training might impose. Your Medi-
cal Battery is the best I have used.”
(Signed) GEORGE TOWNS.
Mr. F. C. DYER, Barcom Street, Sydney, says:
“ I have been an inmate of two leading Sydney
Hospitals without receiving apparent benefit. I
was tired of suffering and consulted the Special-
ists of your Institute, and am completely cured of
Hydatids of the Liver.”
INSPECTOR FOWLER, N.S.W. Police, writes :
“ Since adopting your Electro-Medical treat-
ment, my health ha 3, I am glad to say, consider-
ably improved.”
Mr. EDWARD CLARK, J.P., St. Leonards,
Sydney, twice Mayor of that suburb, and its
Member in Parliament for years, writes
“ I trr.ed your Electro-Medical methods with
great success. My ill-health has disappeared.”
Mr. PATRICK LARKIN, J.P., Sydney,
testifies: —
“ I adopted your treatment for a few weeks.
I am satisfied it gives health and vigor to the
system.”
After all this indisputable evidence, can you any longer doubt our ability or sincerity to
cure you ? If you have the slightest doubt in your mind vve will give you further proof of the
efficacy of our wonderful healing treatment.

BEAUTY IS . . .
WOMAN’S BIRTHRIGHT
To be Beautiful Her Dearest Desire.
A CLEAR, radiant complexion is, and has ever been, the chiefest attribute of Beauty.
How bitter, then, it is for a woman to find her mirror betray those tiny crowsfeet
gathering at her eye^orners —to mark how day by day the ugly creeping wrinkles
down the sides of her mouth grow more and more pronounced. All the promptings of
nature rebel at their invasion. Yet neglect, only self neglect, will allow of their continuance.
VALAZE,
that Dainty Russian Skin Food, comes as a gift to women, bringing the boon of beauty with
its use. Valaze and all things unlovely cannot exist together. It clears away the gathering
crowsfeet, the creeping wrinkles—it removes sallowness, freckles and tan —all by virtue of
its nutritive skin qualities. The clogged and stifled skin pores are freed from their impuri.
es that exquisite network of nerves and muscles that under'ie the skin and give it fresh-
ness are reinvigorated—the complexion takes on that soft purity of flesh and tint peculiar
to the skinsof little children. You use Valaze to-day. Persist in its use. Just see for
yourself how beautiful it will make you. Valaze is guaranteed not to encourage the growth
of hair. 3s 6d and 6s jar (containing three times the amount), postage 6il.
VALAZE HERBAL SOAP.
This delicate skin cleanser and nutritive should be on the toilet table of every woman who
wishes to preserve her good looks. It is compounded from almonds and rare herbs—and
your every pore will respond to its influence. It is largely used by Court Beauties in Russia
and Vienna. Lasts thrice as long as ordinary soaps. 2s cake, postage 2d.
RUSMO HAIR KILLER.
Infinite harm may be wrought upon the skin of women who place implicit trust in the claims
that unscrupulous persons put forth to permanently remove superfluous hairs. Rusmo Hair
Killer was chosen by Mile. Rubinstein, whilst in Europe recently, as being absolutely the
best preparation for the self removal of superfluous hairs in use there. Rusmo was chosen
on both the advice of leading Dermatologists, and after a trial of every preparation in
general use. It removes superfluous hairs instantly without leaving an after blemish no
matter how tender one’s skin. ss, postage 3d.
Valaze BlacKhead <EL Open Pore Cure.
These unsightly defects that mar the beauty of so many Australian women are permanently
removed by this preparation of Dr. Lykuski’s, the famous Complexion Specialist of Russia.
It is quite harmless to the most tender skin and cures the most stubborn case. 2s 6d box,
posted 2s 9d.
VALAZE MASSAGE ROLLERS.
These dainty little devices bring all the benefits of Massage into the home. They have
special features that are protected by patent and cannot be infringed. Very simple to use,
and full instructions go with each box. With them every woman may have a Beauty parlor
in her own boudoir. They knead away wrinkles and crowsfeet, induce a healthy circulation
of the blood and refresh the muscles of the face. Equally good for reducing or plumping
out the flesh. Single Roller 8s 6d, in case 10s 6d— set of two in case, 18s 6d— full-
size set in case, 255.
Refuse Substitutes.
If a chemist, when you ask for Valaze, offers
you something else that is “just as good,”
absolutely refuse to take it. There is no
Skin Food as good as Valaze, though some
Chemist who make more profit out of
another line may tell you so for his interest
—not yours.
Guide to Beauty.
We send a copy of this little Booklet—giving
hundreds of Beauty hints interesting to
every woman—for the name of a chemist not
stocking Yalaze or with the purchase of any
Yalazo preparation

THE . . .
Valaze Massage Institutes
274 COLLINS ST„ MELBOURNE;
158 PITT STREET, SYDNEY.
All the exercises of Beauty Building which have won fame for the Complexion Specialists of
Europe are daily practised under the personal supervision of Mile. Helena Rubinstein
Here the ugly creeping wrinkles are kneaded away—the skin pores are renewed and cleansed
—the languid muscles strengthened—new vigor given to the nerve filaments—the hungry
tissues filled and satisfied.
Not only is ordinary Face Massage practised at the Valaze Massage Institute, but all
SERIOUS FACIAL BLEMISHES ARE ALSO
SUCCESSFULLY TREATED
—such as Birth Marks, Moles, Disfiguring Growths, Red Noses, Double Chins, &c. The
PERMANENT removal of Superfluous Hairs is undertaken with unfailing success. All
the latest devices as used in the European Complexion Institutes are employed with those
modern methods Mile. Rubinstein studied so exhaustively when visiting Russia and
Vienna lately.
Consultation costs nothing. Mile. Rubinstein may be seen daily, and advises clients on
all complexion matters.
VALAZE Preparations are so/ci by all Chemists throughout the
Commonwealth and New Zealand, or direct from Mile. H.

EXPERIENCE
GUIDES THE WISE* and that is why Wise Men
and Women consult MR* EDWIN HOLLAND,
and use his Preparations for Restoring Growth,
Lustre, and Vitality to the Hair*
MR. HOLLAND has had 28 years’ experience in the treat-
ment of the Scalp and Hair, and that is why he is the most
successful Hair Specialist in 4 Australasia. His preparations are the
result of the knowledge gained by this long experience, and their
success is proved by the thousands of testimonials in his possession
expressing gratitude for the growth of Hair, for the cure of Scalp
complaints and greatly improved appearance through Beautified
Hair. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that MR. HOLLAND
is an Expert Hair Specialist, and is consulted by num-
bers, including medical men.

TESTIMONIALS,
KTrTJo'hson, Wairon,
N.Z.—As the people of
this town hare heard so
much of your Parasene
they hare asked me to
stock it for them, as Mr.
L. Peak-man has used it
with such good results;
in fact, he has a good head
of hair now, whereas
some time ago he hud
not a scrap.
Mr. O'Rourke, of
N.S.W., writes that he
has used four bottles of
Hair Restorer, with the
result that, from being
nearly bald, his hair
has noiv come back to its
usual growth.
Inexperienced Novices may make extravagant and
impossible claims for their untried preparations, claims which burst
like a bubble before practical tests. But, although MR. HOLLAND
can prove his preparations to have succeeded where all other treat-
ments have failed, his experience has taught him both the possi-
bilities and the limitations of all Hair and Scalp treatments, and he
values honesty and honor in business too highly to make any claims
which cannot be fully substantiated by fair test.
As good looks these days are' essential to both sexes, and,
indeed, are woman’s chief object in life, and a Beautiful Head of Hair
is the chief essential to Beauty, MR. HOLLAND’S unequalled ex-
perience is of the highest value to all seekers of Improved Appearance.
HOLLAND’S Marvellous Hair Restorer
has gained a world-wide reputation for arresting the premature decay,
promoting the growth, and giving lustre to the hair. If your hair is falling
off, try it; if it is thin, try it. Price, 35., 45., 55.,

SIR ROBERT BEAR, Cheap Book Depot,

We take pleasure In publishing the following in*
teresting letter from Mr. James Sumers, who also
very kindly sends his photograph:
“Indigestion and liver complainc
troubled me greatly, and the money I
spent on various medicines was only
wasted, as they did me no good. A
friend asked me why I did not take
AYER’S
Sarsaparilla
I thought that if I did the result would
be the same as with the other medi-
cines; but, to my great surprise, after
taking a few doses I felt really better,
and I continued until I had taken, in all,
seven or eight bottles. I was then able
to digest my food, and it made me feel like a hew man. I now always
have with me a supply of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.” James Sumers, North
Terrace, Adelaide, S. A. \
Of course you cannot enjoy good health if your stomach gives out.
You must have an appetite, must digest your food, and must keep
your liver active. Muscular strength, nervous strength, desire to be
active, arnd a feeling of general good health may be yours by keeping
your liver active and your blood pure. Ayer’s Sarsaparilla strengthens
the stomach and aids digestion.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla will do all this for you, but
you must insist upon getting “AYER’S,” for it is
stronger,,' contains more valuable ingredients, and
cures more quickly than any other kind.

THE
HANDY HOME REMEDY
A Box of BEECHAITS PILLS should always be kept in the house,
as, like a “stitch in time,” they may save much future worry and expense.
On the first sign of any derangement of the system a dose should be taken,
and they will invariably have the most beneficial effect.
“ Prevention'is better than cure,” we are told. Next time you feel
“out of sorts,” just take a dose of BEECHAM’S PILLS, and so prevent
a seemingly small ailment growing into serious trouble. BEECHAITS
PILLS prevent illness as well as cure it. Most people take them to keep
themselves in good health. These are wise and happy ones—they hardly
ever know what ill-health is.
There is no medicine in the world to compare with
Beeeham’s
Pills.
They will not harm the most- delicate—and the strongest will benefit
by using them. They are a tried remedy—the trusted friend of thousands
of families all over the world.
Women especially suffer from Headache, Backache, Loss of Energy
and Spirits, Nervous Dyspepsia, and many other ailments which make life
almost unbearable. Every woman can be immediately relieved of this
suffering if upon the first sign of derangement she will take a dose
of BEECHAITS PILLS.
WORTH A GUINEA A BOX.

THE ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS of
Sept. 28, 1895, says :
“ If I were asked which single medicine I should
prefer to take abroad with me, as likely to be
most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I should say ChloroDyne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.”
