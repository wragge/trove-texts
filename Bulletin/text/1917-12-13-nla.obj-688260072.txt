The Red Page
“Escaped Ped”: “Bald Head” (B. 8/11/17),--in
his discussion on Australian as spoken, shows either
a remarkable lack of observation or intelligence. In
the one series he quotes slcevle for school, ke-ule for
cool etc. The mispronunciation is absent from the
speech of about 98 per cent, of our school children
The remaining 2 per 'cent, are importations. Brill
in the vowel sound oo is stressed in N. S. Hales
schools, from the infants to the upper classes, not
only in singing lessons, but also in phonetic exer-
cises; so if “Bald Head” heard a typical class of
Australian youngsters give expression to then
opinion of him, ho would have to acknowledge the
clearness of diction. What I consider f the:• most
common fault in Australian speech is the slurring
of the final consonant, or causyjg it to run into
the vowel sound of the next word, as boas-tof loi
boost of) ge-tit for get it; ball-dead for bald head.
New Poems by Zora Cross
THE BRIDAL ODE.
Soft sped the last and lonely night
Of my unshadowed maidenhood,
As youngest stars shed amber light . *
Along the wood;
And through the moon’s ivind-loosened hair,
Small, dulcet voices round and sweet
Made mellow music on the air
Of joy complete. <■
When, drowsed with ecstasies of dream,
Beside my bridal veil I spied
Great Sappho standing in the gleam
Of still star-tide;
And, by her eyes of love and power,
She offered me a favor fair —
The golden blossom of an hour
To have and ivear.
“Oh, sing,” I said, “an ode for me
Of trembling vows and kisses fine,
To match the tender witchery
Of longings mine.
Sing of the folded bliss that lies
In miracles of married rest
Where sense that aches for gladness dies
To reach love’s best.
“Oh, take my soul for your lost lyre;
And from its chords a music sweep
To tell my love my true desire
In notes that leap
Like flame of all my being draton
To him, surrendering full-deep
The perfect passion’s waking dawn
From virgin sleep."
She touched my bridal veil and smiled.
As. kissing with her finger-tips
The orange wreath upon it piled,
She moved her lips.
Her singing speech fell faint and low,
And round my heart wild raptures flung;
“Ah. nirl, if you but love him so,
My ode is sung."
WEDDED
The seas of Paradise around me flood.
I feel their torrents leaping through iriy
"blood,
Melt in my mouth. .. .Who spoke of Death?
... .Ah met
This is the margin of eternity.
The drops of day full on my fainting eyes.
The dew of sleep throbs to my head and dies.
I am the vineyard and you are my lord.
Death cannot touch us with her scarlet
sword.
Gather the grapes that cluster round my soul.
Drink at the milky fountains as they roll
Over the valley that my being shrines.
Feed as a hart among the mountain pines.
My body is no more. It swoons to air
From the close sepulchre of one mute prayer.
Red the abundant blossoms of the sun
That fire our couch and languish one by one.
You are a flock of doves that round me float,
Beating your pinions on my perfumed throaf.
Your lips are as a hive of bees that fly
Moist-winged and swift, to drink the lilies
dry.
Here in the ecstasy of life I rest.
The doves and bees sleep on my quiet
breast ....
Ah God! such rapture running through my
brain
Trembles my body bock to breathe again*
Cold-fanged and crimson-flanked, Death
passes by.
Some clot of 'clay crumbles at every sigh.
What should ice fear? The full rich day we
know
Shall fail not of its tender afterglow.
The first edition of Zora Cross’s Songs of
Love and Life (Tyrrell) is now unprocur-
able. So Angus and Robertson, Sydney, bring
out a second edition, with some new poems,
a portrait of the author, end-decorations by
S. Tire Smith and an exquisite Norman
Lindsay cover. But in Zora Cross’s new
edition the added verses do not add a dis-
tinction to a collection that already has it;
they do not reach her highest standard;
though of the 15 new specimens of her work
five are worth while, and the two quoted
worth reprinting.
Australian Fiction
Ray Phillips writes the usual Australian
war story, The White Feather (Melville and
Mullen, Melb.), but she writes it neatly and
well. There is the usual nice boy who
grows., up with the usual girl, gets en-
tangled with the usual other girl, has to
marry her, and. is thus prevented from en-
listing-. For tile clinging Jessie threatens
to commit suicide —and actually tries —if he
leaves her. Naturally the other girl sends
him a white feather. But the reader knows
that everything will come right in the last
chapter. The pictures of Melbourne, of Aus-
tralian home-life, of life at the training-
camp, and of the other incidents of the early
days of the war are admirably done. The
White Feather is quite up to the standard of
the light overseas war novel.
Taking up Tli? White Champion: A Story
of the Australian Ring (N.S.W. Bookstall
Co.; Is.), this page expected to find the
usual yarn glorifying a trade that is now,
surely, declassd. The name of the author,
Don Delaney, however, was a reassuring fac-
tor : the workmanship of this writer, whose
pen-name shelters a well-known Sydney jour-
nalist, is always neat if not profound. The
cover showed a white prize-fighter knocking
out a huge black pugilist. That seemed all
that it was necessary to know about this
yarn. But as this page has the unnecessary
habit of reading right through every book of
Australian publication, it made a discovery.
The yarn is a simple, straightforward one of
simple types; but it is a -highly-interesting
yarn, and the types are faithfully presented.
The opening chapter is crafty : it is a pic-
ture of the no-doubt celebrated ring-victory
of a no-doubt celebrated champion of the
English ring, Tom Cribb, in 1811. Cribb
beats his opponent, a black, in one of the
“decisive battles of the world” of prize-
fighting. Now it happens that Jack'Red-
wood, the son of a farmer in the Shoalhaven
River, N.S.W., is a direct descendant of that
famous English champion. The youth is a
superb horseman, but has had no opportu-
nity to prove himself with the gloves. Of
course, he is in love with the daughter of a
neighboring farmer, and, owing to his
mother’s disapproval of the match, he clears
out, to fend for himself. He falls in with a
travelling buck-jumping show, and makes
good. . , ,
How he makes good is told xn a chapter
full of verve and excitement. Owing to a
vicious horse throwing his rider and savaging
the delightful “champion lady buekjump bul-
lock-rider of Australia,” Jack leaps into the
ring to her rescue. He has only his fists
against the maddened horse.
“It was a singular fight—that fight
between the unarmed man and the huge
yellow horse that had been spurred from
shoulder to flank on both sides, and was
covered with dust, foam and blood from tail
to muzzle But the horse was free of the
bit and bridle, and his terrible teeth had
full play. Shaking his huge head after the
rattling blow Jack had dealt him on the jaw,
the horse renewed the attack with redoubled
fury Rearing up, he struck at his human
opponent with Bis forefeet... .Jack dodged,
ducked and side-stepped. The horse went
after him, striking out furiously with his
forefeet and repeatedly reaching forward
with his head to snap at the man with his
teeth. Every time that the great head was
lowered young Redwood drove a sledge-
hammer blow to the horse’s muzzle or jaw.
Diavolo’s nostrils spurted blood. He was a
terrifying sight. Once the iron-sliod hoof
caught the young fellow in the ribs and sent
him to the eround, but he was up and away
again before the gleaming teeth could reach
him. Jumping in close, Jack forced the
fighting.”
Jack didn’t know how. to knock-out a
horse. But the showman did; and Jack took
his advice. “Dodging another swinging blow
from the horse’s near fore-foot, he jumped in
and drove a terrific right-liand blow to the
pulsing artery just behind the horse’s ear.
As the fist made connection the yellow, horse
swayed, toppled over and fell on his side on
the trampled, torn-up earth.”
And the showman regrets his loss of a
fortune. If only a cinematograph-operator
had been there ! ...
But Jack is destined for the ring. At his
first private lesson “he dropped naturally
into the exact attitude of a certain great
prizefighter of 100 years ago!” And this
young Australian, who had never seen gloves
before, fought instinctively according to the
old London P.R. rules ! When his trainer
is knocked out, the showman explains:
“You’ve been hit by a ahost. That was Tom
Cribb’s favorite blow, but ’ow the ’ell this
lad from the Shoalhaven River comes to ’ave
it is more’n I can tell I,v1 ,v
Don Delaney, however, is prodigal in the
provision of fights. There is another, with-
out gloves, fought to the finish in a ring at
midnight, in which the hero is again victori-
ous. The Bur ns-Johnson fight is graphically
retold again, though here, of course, Jack is
merely a spectator. And the story ends with
a scene set in the future —a clumsy expedi-
ent of the novelist —in which the descendant
of Tom Cribb repeats that famous victory by
defeating the black world’s champion. But
all these are insignificant episodes compared
with that heroic combat between a man’s
fists and a maddened horse. If only the pub-
lisher had placed Lionel Lindsay’s fine illus-
tration of that fight on the cover!
Certainly the suddenly-sobered world has
outgrown this mimic warfare; there is
another kind of fighting sternly necessary
now; The White Champion is issued three
years too late; and the glory of the prize-
ring has forever departed. Yet the thing is
finely done.
Steele Rudd does not improve. The Old
Homestead (N.S.W. Bookstall Co., Is.),
which ran as a serial in The Lone Hand,
is the now too familiar farrago of hilarious
happenings on the usual selection. Is life
outback one riot of fights, foolishness and
funny falls?
The English
lan Hay, author of The First 100,000, has
a few words of commiseration for The
Oppressed English (Doubleday, Page, per
Angus and Robertson, Sydney, 2s. 9d.).. The
Englishman does not want the limelight in this
war; he doesn’t object to the credit for every
victory being given to the Anzacs, the
Canadians, the Scots, the Welsh, the Irish.
“Plis job, for its own sake, suffices him. So
he smiles paternally on these aggressive
patriotic little brethren of his; allows them
to absorb all possible credit for their re-
spective achievements; and philosophically
shoulders the responsibilities for the short-
comings of the British Empire. It saves
trouble; it saves explanation; and an aver-
age Englishman would rather be scalped
than explain.” lan Hay asks the Ameri-
can to understand that the Englishman is
reared up from sclioolboyhood in the fear of
two most potent deities: “side” and “shop.”
He mustn’t talk about himself, or his work,
or his achievements, or his ambitions, or his
wife; though this rather spoils his chances
as a conversationalist. Nor must he discuss
professional matters out of office hours.
This applies especially to officers’ messes.
“In short, the more highly qualified, you are
to speak on a subject, the more slightingly
you refer to it; and the more passionately
you are interested in a matter the less you
say about it.”
The author kindly produces the tablets of
the Englishman’s secular decalogue. The'
seventh commandment is: “Thou shalt make
war as a sportsman. That is to say,, thou
shalt not study the science too laboriously
beforehand, for that would savor of pro-
fessionalism ” The 10th Commandment
is • “Thou shalt render thyself inconspicu-
ous. Thou shalt not wear unusual apparel.
. ...” The Scot looks down on the English
as a frivolous, feckless race, devoid of ambi-
tion. So it comes that England to-day re-
quires a bill to give Home Rule to England:
her army is led by a Scot, her navy by
another Scot, a third Scot directs the Im-
perial General Staff. The Lord Chancellor,
the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the
Foreign Secretary are also Scots. The
Prime Minister is a Welshman, and the
First Lord of the Admiralty an Irishman.
Dealing delicately but good-humoredly
with the Irish question, lan Hay points
out that Ireland enjoys much more freedom
than her sister isle. She has escaped the
National Insurance scheme and conscription.
“To the black shame and grief of. every true
Irishman. Ireland to-day stands officially
aloof and alone in the struggle for liberty
and humanity.” It is too soon for us to
say yet whether Ireland will or will not
have a companion in her misfortune. And
under the provisions of Wyndham’s Land
Purchase Act Irish tenants were enabled to
buy their farms from, their landlords—-the
difference between their offer and the land-
lord’s offer being, after adjustment, made up
by the English taxpayer. “This little ex-
periment in philanthropy cost the
English considerably more than £100,000,(100.
Under its provisions every Irish, peasant is
now his own proprietor. Evictions are a
thing of the past. Yet how often is this
fact" so much as admitted by soulful ex-
ploiters of Erin’s wrongs in America or the
Dominions?”
“Ireland resembles a ‘temperamental’ wife
married to an intensely respectable but
urexciting husband. She wants to ‘live her
own life.’ ” And she broods. But her
ancient wrongs, grievous enough, were pro-
bably no worse than those of Scotland. But
the Scot doesn’t brood: he emigrates to
England and Ales his ancient oppressor.
Ireland merely appropriates all England s
spare cash and calls her a bloodsucker. lan
Hay delightfully suggests that when the war
is over that unhappy but not undeserving
people, the English; may bo granted some
measure, however slight, of political free-
dom. “After that we must do something
for Poland.”
,**
H. Fielding Hall, author of The Soul of a
People , shows us The Way of Peace (Hurst
and Blackett, per Dymock’s Library). His
plea is for a return to simplicity, to the
identity of the individual with the commu-
nity—and a small community based on land-
holdings. “Primary communities that are
natural and true are limited in size, are
based on a small area of land, and include
all within that area. Humanity has its laws
of crystallisation, as have minerals, and it
will not make crystals over a certain size.
.... What binds a community together is
that common interest and common knowledge
which comes from contiguity within a definite
and not a large area.” England has lost that
sense of community. Both in town and vil-
lage the people are split up into innumer-
able castes.
The author looks back regretfully to
Merrie England, when the village pub was
the village club, when English ale was “a
malted, unliopped drink, wholesome, slightly
exhilarating, but of which few men could
hold enough to get drunk.” The ordinary ale
had but little alcohol in it; it was locally
brewed, but did not keep well; and it was
very cheap. But England has forgotten how
to be merry. So not very hopefully the
author puts forth his suggestion that Eng-
land will revert to the village or town com-
munity, where every individual has an in-
terest in every other, owing to their common
interest in the village land, with local banks
which would lend only to the neighboring in-
habitants, and would know' every borrower
personally. Thus the money would remain
in the village or ward. The credit of all
would then be used for the benefit of indi-
viduals. Elsewhere “the success of these
banks has been enormous. Even the Balkan
States have them, and they are almost uni-
versal in Europe, and in India they are
rapidly spreading.”
So this acute observer and pleasant writer
genially sketches his ideal England, exposing
the current cant of our treatment of love,
marriage, legal justice, criminal procedure
and parliamentary representation; and re-
turning again and again to the forgotten
noble qualities of the good old English ale.
The picture he draws of this possible Eng-
land —especially the picture of the ale—
seems almost too refreshing to be true.
#—
Art in Australia (Angus and Robert-
son, Sydney; 65.) goes bravely on. The
editors, Sydney IJre Smith, Bertram Stev-
ens and C. Lloyd Jones, announce in this,
the third, number that future editions will
include specimens of overseas art, in order
to assist our. students to escape from a case-
hardening provincialism. A literary supple-
ment will also be issued. Exquisitely
printed in color and typographically admir-
able, this issue includes beautiful color re-
productions of pictures by Blamire Young,
Norman Lindsay; Max Meldrum, James R.
Jackson, W. Lister Lister, J. Muir Auld
and Margaret R. McPherson; etchings by
Victor Cobb and Bruce Robertson ; and photo-
graphs of sculptures by C. Web Gilbert.
The letterpress is interesting. Artists will
be especially interested in the method that
Blamire Young uses to produce his remark-
able water-colors. The chief features of the
various biographies are the number of cases
in which Australian artists had to scrape
and save money to make the pilgrimage to
London and Paris, and the difficulty they
experienced in making a living by their
brush in those inhospitable climes.
In response to our suggestion that some
neater and more useful substitute might be
invented for the uncouth terms Australasia
and Australasian, various writers oblige:
Wyn Kay’s selection: Strasia, Strdtia, Aus-
trasia and others forgets M.L.; “Weevil’s’
adjective Britanwian or would re-
quire the substantive to be Britannia or
Briton: “Goat’s” Austranzia or Austranz
certainly includes the two nations,. blit is
clumsy: R. L. Jamieson’s Bullzac includes
the two nations but gives too great a prom-
inence to the bull ; “W .A.R.” invents a
mythical animal, the Kangamoa, anu asks us
to name its domicile after the beast.
“N’importe” suggests' Crucalia _ or Crucannia.
Britannia is derived from El Berith _or Albert of
Scripture, otherwise Ursa Major, which bears the
same relation to the North Pole as Crux, i.e., the
Southern Cross, to the South. Ber (or in plural
Berith l annia is the country of the Bear or Boar
Does anyone Drefer Crossland or Croyland, also Rood
or Rudland?' Rood is old English and Scots for
cross. By the holy rood !
“Bill Badd”: I tested our kiddies’ pronunciation
recently by stopping sundry kids coming from school
and asking where, they had been. Out of ten, only
one said skc-vle, and she also added the information
that “feyther’s eoomin’ hooam i’ th’ next booat,
or something like that; which suggests that the
imports “Baldhead” mentions were more extensive
than he was aware of. Did anyone ever hear the
Sentimental Bioko say Ice-ute for coot? Ask Den.
Youse may have been born and bred in the hush, but
it is an old friend of the city paper-boy. It appears
to be mainly used to express the plural, an(i the
users generally say you when they mean you. they
fall in attempting to create a plural, and say
youse hlolces, or in the case of the- newsboy youse
peas. A plain'-Australian tongue would have to
learn to say its Owner was going tew town, ine
kid’s not getting a fair deal. And you an Aus-
tralian, Baldhead! Ask any genuine Australian kid
what you arc; and I’ll bet you drinks he doesn t
say /tile or food.

You can’t see the glass in a win-

Bon Ami, it is so deaf and free
from streaks and specks.
Bon Arni cleans by the wet-and-dry
method, like a metal-
polish. You rub a wet
cloth on the cake of
Bon Ami, making a
white lather. Cover
the glass with this
lather, let it dry, and
wipe it off. It only
takes a minute, and
the result is wonderful.
In the United States it is estimated
that 60,000,000 people use Bon Ami.
Bon Ami also cleans mirrors and
smooth, shiny surfaces of all kinds,
such as bath-tubs, tile, kitchenware,
white paint, nickel, copper and brass.
It is also good for
white shoes.

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

Sleep.
Hushed is the heart of night. All things are
still
As, down the creeping softness, Silence shakes
Her noiseless censer at her drowsy will
And not one murmur makes.
W hite moonbeams, fainting as they drift
along
The loose and lavendered cool linen, stream
On rug and carven couch ; and visions throng
Till all the room is dream.
Curtain and flowered vase and mulberry urn,
Round w T hich flute-fingered figures float in
mist,
Doze in the shadows as they lift and turn
In folds of amethyst.
The pictures sleep upon the soft, grey walls.
Muffled in muted sound, that from the chords
Of slumbering harps and cymbals lulling falls
Along their painted swards ;
Wild w’ater-flags swoon by the pools in rest;
The tamarisk and rose in old repose
Nod where a dark-eyed maiden bares her
breast
In the calm evening close.
Jewels, star-tinct and silver comb and case
Drowse on the antique table, charmed and
fair;
And languid lights in tranquil sandals pace
The viewless arch of air.
Odors of easy eastern mysteries
Coil from the somnolent, silk coverlet,
Whose woven widths of flowers and broid-
ered trees
Fade now the moon has set.
All things are fast asleep. Slow darkness
lies
Upon the lids of night inaudibly.
And God is dreaming of His Paradise
At rest in you and me.

So it is ended ! The long, long watching;
The dread of the secret doors unlatching;
The creeping fear lest the world discover
You friend unfaithful and perjured lover !
Ended the struggle to screen and hide
Your poor stark self with my sleepless
pride;
And no more need for the heart-wrung
prayer
That I no child of your name might bear!
You failed me living ; but now, in dying,
There’s no more treachery, no more lying;
No more women the worse for you,
For the hearts of the dead perforce are true !
So, freed from shame by your latest breath,
I can love you proudly, at last, in Death !

Out in the eastern heavens,
Speeding its rays afar,
Steadfast apd silver and single,
Glittered a splendid star.
Said one: “Thank God, it is stationed,
Lighting the seas and lands,
Out of the reach of merchants,
Free of their sordid hands.
“For some would market its beauty,
Barter its breadth for gold,
Portion it out in house-lots
Till all of the star was sold !”
Said another, eyes on its shining,
Silver and silent and far:
“Better the near than the distant.
Better the lamp than the star!”

Glittered the splendor on high,
Like unto honor and virtue,
Unsellable there in the sky.

A New Light on
the Tyre Question
Imported tyres have not always proved as
satisfactory in Australia as they have in the
land of their manufacture.
This is chiefly because they have not been
built for Australian conditions. Our roads
are always exacting on the wearing qualities
of any tyre, and it takes long experience
and much experimenting under these very
conditions to discover just the type of tyre
that will give the best kind of service.
After many years- of experience in their
manufacture, we offer our Australian-made
PERDRIAU TYRES
as the answer to the Tyre question.
The Quality of the Rubber and the founda-
tion fabric and the design and construction
of the tyres themselves make them ideal on
our roads, where they help to prove the
soundness of the proposition of the Aus-
tralian Product for Australian consumption.
Fit them next time and Keep the Home Tyres Turning.
Obtainable through all Garages or from the Manufacturers.

THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING IN
EARNEST.
Ir before the war anyone had said that
Germany, hemmed in on her eastern and
western frontiers, with her shipping swept
from the sea and the ordinary industrial
life of the country reduced to chaos, would
at the end of three years and a half be dis-
covered fighting with much greater strength
than when the disturbance commenced, the
possession of such delusions would have
been an almost certain passport to the near-
est asylum for the insane. It is a sure
thing that nobody in Germany ever even
dreamed that it was possible. In London
and Paris the idea of a struggle on the scale
the world is now contemplating would have
seemed like the product of a disordered imagi-
nation, or the feeble effort of a pacifist
scaremonger, or the invention of some dan-
gerous enemy of constitutional government.
There are heaps of literature belonging to
the pre-war period proving with the cold
exactitude of the late lamented Euclid that
a European war would he an affair of a week
or so, or at most of a month or two. It was
the one point upon which all alleged experts
were agreed. The economist emerged from
a struggle with arithmetic satisfied that
what he generally called the delicate
machinery of finance would come to a dead
stop in the event of war. and that unless the
armies and navies swept one another out
of the way in quick tinfe bankruptcy and
famine would brood over the landscape. The
commentator on military affairs explained
with copious detail how modern arms of
precision, rapid methods of transport and
the evolution of naval warfare had created
conditions under which armies and navies
would be launched at one another with
tremendous momentum, and the parties who
reeled away from the first shock would be
broken beyond repair. The occasional indi-
vidual who murmured something to the con-
trary in a literary way was treated as a
freak. How hopelessly wrong the ideas of
even the most acute minds in War Offices
and banks and Parliaments were has for a
long; time now been a subject of wonder-
ment in even the most remote parts of the
earth. That bankruptcy and famine are
stalking about in various directions may be
true. But it is certain that the war goes
raging on, and that, so far as can be seen,
may continue to rage until one side or the
other finds its nerves beginning to collapse.
The capacity of Europe to adjust itself to
an environment entirely different from what
it had been accustomed to is what the Kaiser
and everybody else omitted to take into
account. What they have to find out now
is not the effect of artillery or the suscepti-
bility of the financial machine to disruption,
but the point to which a nation’s endur-
ance may be stretched, either in pursuit of
territorial aggrandisement or in resistance to
conquest.
* * * *
Now, how long, in the absence of decisive
victory by land or sea, could Germany or
Britain or France or the United States per-
sist? There is nothing to show yet that one
or the lot could not go on for years, pro-
vided the people concerned continued to
believe that it was better to hang on than
accept the consequences of knocking off. And
it is just here that the Allies have the
advantage of the German; for the induce-
ment to the subjects of the Kaiser to keep on
wearing field-grey is at rock-bottom no more
than that the Fatherland may earn a univer-
sal hatred and keep nossession of stolen pro-
perty. To the population of France and
Britain and America the encouragement not
to knock off is that the alternative is the
acceptance of mastery by a foreign autoc-
racy—the loss of territory and of national
freedom. And the longer it takes the Ger-
man to forc<; victory by his guns and gas and
submarines, the more must he ponder whether
it is all worth while—the more frequently
must he begin to ask himself whether the
problematical advantages to be derived from
the stolen property outweigh the definite
advantages of starting to live in peace and
quietness again. And contemplation of his
own powers of endurance, great though they
may be. can give him no sort of happiness
when he considers the resources of his
opponents. Excepting the Russians the
people of Germany have felt the war more
painfully than any others engaged in it.
Their food has been meagre. Their hours of
labor have grown longer than ever before.
On the women of Germany the struggle lias
placed heavy burdens. In yearly increasing
numbers they have been called upon for
laborious toil on the farm and in the work-
shop. Britain is far from this stage yet.
There are still in England thousands of idle
men. hundreds of thousands engaged in
supplying the demand for things which the
German long ago learned to do without.
Enormous numbers of women are working in
war trades, but not nearly so many as are
not working at all in any national sense. To
the United States the war has not even
begun to be a reality. Is there any reason
to suppose that either of those countries,
faced with the ugly alternative of quitting
and taking what Berlin might choose to offer,
would shrink from the unpleasantness _ of
standing what the German has schooled him-
self to endure? This paper knows of no
reason, anyway. If it did, it would not now
be urging the Australian-born to stand by
his manhood and his freedom with a naked
bayonet. Time fights for the Allies as long
as thev can keep the enemy where he is now
or thereabouts. But —and let Australia
mark this —on the day the Allies show signs
of flinching, the German will be encouraged.
He will at least believe that Time is on his
side.
* * * *
Britain has not even started to live as
Germany has lived ever since the war passed
into the second year. America has only
begun to think about it. With the entire
manhood and womanhood of both countries
brought to the stage at which every indivi-
dual was reduced to the point of working
only for the maintenance of the army and
navy and providing sustenance for the
civilian population, the German's fasting
would be as vain as his boasting over the
ruins of Belgium. There are more improb-
able things than that this may happen.
The gag about the immense amount of
wealth lost through war, and incitements to
accept any old peace in order to resume
business at the old address, are not nearly
so influential as they were. Wealth is a
variable commodity, anyhow. A country in
which the people get enough to eat, are fully
employed in defence of their freedom, and
have an army holding off an invader has all
the wealth it needs. The mere creation of
wealth in order that a handful of individuals
may get the use of most of it neither helps
to win a war nor makes anyone hapnier
afterwards. Chasing round after golden
calves when an enemy is battering at the
front door is of all possible forms of activity
the most futile. What Britain wants to-day
is not that someone in Lancashire or London
shall be engaged in producing material that
can be classed as an addition to the wealth
of the country in the sense of being a trading
commodity used for private profit, but that
all hands' shall work for the nation alone.
This is not quite what Germany has got.
It spells Socialism to the last letter, and
Socialism except as a philosophical exercise
is to the Prussian the very devil. Germany,
instead, has a police-created obedience to
rules and regulations which, with promise of
eventual plunder, keeps the community keyed-
up to a steady belief that if everybody bogs in
without asking for explanations the enemy’s
resolution will buckle up under the strain
put upon his inferior stamina. In dealing
with some peoples—the Russians are a con-
venient example—the German proved him-
self the better stayer. What his Western
opponents may be capable of in the way of
endurance he has yet to discover; and,
unless he scores a knock-out win. he must
certainly spend a lons' time stewine in his
own juice, sustained by dreams about the
division of the plunder later on, before lie
learns the truth. The great danger to
the \llies is that the German may score this
knock out. The great danger to the Ivaiser
is that the Allies may resist it and prolong
the privations endured by his people. This
paper is not convinced that a German vic-
torv by battle is now impossible. Because
there is a probability of this, and because
the staying powers of the allied nations will
get no chance if the fighting line is bioken,
The Bulletin wants to see the Common-
wealth army maintained as a fighting force.
It is no good telling this paper that our
army can make no difference. Such an allega-
tion is a libel on the troops. It can make a
difference. Everywhere those lads have been
they have made a difference. And every day
the German is baulked in the West scores
one against the Kaiser and one for human
liberty.

PEACE.
War and not Peace is the natural state of
man. Set down in cold ink this thing that
was a truism to some of the best thinkers
among the Athenians has a hopeless and per-
verted 100k —a hint of the epigram, which is
falsehood dressed in the cloak and under-
pants of truth, and a savor of the blasphemy
at which the gods smile while the faithful
rage in their name. But Nature has her own
creed and her own practice; and the luw of
eternal war is one of the foundation planks
in the platform of evolution. The primal
cells fought in the original protoplasm;
the rudimentary plant and animal forms
stormed each other’s trenches with a fury
that never abated for 10U.000,000 years ; the
sea from end to end is still one vast battle-
field ; every acre of the globe’s surface is the
scene of a thousand battles every day
between horde and horde of small living
creatures whose only peace is a rest in
preparation for the next attack. The aero-
plane, the submarine, the tank and the
poisonous gas are only things imitated by
man from Nature’s lower forms. Hinden-
burg’s tunnel is duplicated wherever a rat
seeks protection from a prowling cat; and
the wasp that flies and stings “drove down
six and destroyed two” any summer’s day
when the aircraft of Nature were able to
observe. Through the rising forms of life
the fighting instinct is maintained. The
things that are weak in war are cunning in
defence; but not even a browsing rabbit ever
dreamt that there was a Hague Convention
possible by which the dog could be kept
from the chase or the ferret induced to fix
the business of living by arbitration. Natu-
rally, man, the animal, inherits exactly the
same fundamental view of things. War, in
some form, is his very life until he begins
to climb out of himself into strange spir-
itual places and gets his eyes out of focus by
gazing at stars and esoteric wonders that
have no relation to liis pressing need for
dinner. For Nature’s law of growth is
dependent upon war. War —the bitter
struggle for existence—is the dynamic force
of all progress; and on the natural plane
peace and death are interchangeable terms.
In the human body microbes of a hundred
kinds battle up and down the growing
tissues, raging through storms of life for the
possession of heart nr lungs or brain ; and in
the very blood itself corpuscles are striving
for the mastery night and day without
pause. The right of a man to move a finger
or lift an eyelid is won by battle; and what
more natural than that man, kept alive by
war, must find his life in war also? On a
theory that Nature stands for peace, the
whole business of living is a hideous dis-
cord. Only dead things are at peace; and a
philosophy of peace must bring human
thought to the hopeless quiet of the rocks
and stones that are blind and deaf to the
armies of moving life that trample over
them.
* * * *
The war that is roaring up and down the
borders of France and Belgium, desolating
the seas and tossing its spray of death as
far as the Euphrates and Jerusalem, though
it has made the world’s heart ache and
blinded the peoples with tears, is absolutely
in line with all that might have been ex-
pected of the race of man. Sooner or later
that world-clash was bound to come; for
although the cushions of alleged civilisation
were soft and the savage underneath the
mask manicured his finger-nails, the old law
was working and the old conditions which
made for blood and horror were maintained.
Wise men viewing the future in the light of
the past trembled for what might be. long
before a gun was fired. They saw in cities
like London, New York and Chicago ever-
smouldering volcanoes that might break into
violent flame ; but they did not note—or, at
any rate, the number who noted was not
large enough to be impressive—the fact that
men of intellectual force in the Teuton
lands were deliberately preparing to use the
force of the instinct which worked by the
eternal war-law for their own' schemes and
ambitions. Nature, red in fang and talon,
was on the Kaiser’s side from the first; and
with the first crash of the IG-inch shells the
passion of fighting, which was, in fact, the
passion of natural life, shook the nations
from the Urals to the Bay of Biscay. That
in such a turmoil the highly-organised and
prepared fighting forces of Germany were
not immediately victorious was nrobably due
to some miscalculation of the distance man
had actually travelled from Nature. When
the failure of the Kaiser at the Marne comes
to be written in terms of psychology, the
great and overwhelming lesson of the' war
will be known to men. The angels at Mons
and elsewhere may stand as an eternal para-
ble. and the fact of their appearance be
accepted as truer than would have been the
case had the supposed heavenlv visitants
been actually caught by the camera and
placed complete to the last holv feather on
the moving-picture screen. For the call to
animal force, supplemented and sharpened
by every device of steel and fire, did meet
with a resistance which was not on the
natural plane at all; and although the big
scrap must be wrangled through to a finish
just as are the wars of the microscopic
legions in the human body and the deadlv
feuds of sperm whales and decapods in thn
sea depths, the element that is not natural
but which represents a development a hr,,- 1
Nature, will be the deciding factor at th
last. Man must fight; but the soul may
drive home a charge to victory when the bin-
engines of murder and the animal ferncitv
behind them fail.
Somewhere in the near vicinity of those
angels, or the thought they typify, li es t h e
human key to the problem of Peace and
War. War is natural; war must go on to
the end of things; but war can rise to a
higher plane and be waged with other
weapons. The modes of warfare of the trees
are utterly distinct from those of the tiger ■
and those of man, the reasoning being, should
have no close resemblance to the methods of
the beast of prey. To hunt and destroy is
not the object of natural war. Such war in-
volves great loss and suffering in certain
spheres ; but these things are only means to
an end. The purpose of all warfare from
that of the primal cell upwards is progress,
advance into a larger place, more room for
pleasure and safety from pain. If in striv-
ing after these many are hurt or killed that
the few may win to something higher,
Nature has no regrets over the destruction
in the joy of evolving new and stronger
forms. In the wars of man it is different.
The injury wrought to fellow men that the
survivors might reap the benefit was to be
tolerated as long as man was a progressively-
developing animal; but when man ceased so
to develop and shaped a spiritual and mental
course for himself which left his bodily need*
largely out of the count, war on the animal
plane became a shame and a horror. There
was no longer anything to be gained for the
race by waging it in that way; for man had
ceased to be natural, and professed to have
stepped outside Nature’s law. Beyond the
thing that is called war the real wars of man
are being waged—gigantic struggles of co-
operative intellect against tremendous and
only partly-known forces. These wars must
go on. They are vital to man. To stop such
higher fighting and all the progress it in-
volves -would mean the intellectual and
moral death of the race. But the wars of
the merely animal sort, conducted with blood
and fire and Hymns of Hate, interfere with
and prevent the success of the mighty
strategy of mind ; and their persistency is to
be traced to the natural fighting instinct in
men which must have some sort of outlet.
If there is no scope for the mental battle
the animal battle will periodically occur.
This is the bitter philosophy of modern life
which shrieks scorn at those who would cry
peace where there is no peace. While cus-
tom and convenience and the thing called
civilisation force a great bulk of the world’s
people to live on the merely animal plane
the old natural wars will continue; but the
moment the minds of the world’s peoples are
freed to take their part in the great intellec-
tual battles, physical war must be unthink-
able. If the average citizenship of the
nations to-day stood intellectually as high as
the circles of scientists, writers and inven-
tors who push the flywheel of the world-
machine, a fight with steel ami fire and all
the accompaniments of international murder
would never be resorted to in even the most
serious crisis. As a natural induction, the
higher the intellectual standard of the races
of men can be raised, and the keener the
mental fight, the more certainty is there that
the guns will keep cool. But the men and
women whose lives are bounded and hedged
in by the sheer physical struggle to live are
by the working of natural law a perpetual
menace ; for they are the tools of reaction-
ary intellect when it aspires to conquer hr
force the realms where only mind can be
finallv victorious. That the great bulk ot
the world to-day lives on the sordid amm?
plane is the true explanation of the fact that
the great bulk of the world is at war in the
old physical way of the tiger and the snake.
But once force takes the field it must be
met by force. The intellect of the nations
most opposed to the horror of bloodshed must
be organised to prove that physical force
cannot win against ethical conceptions. Mina
must make the sacrifice in order that mind
may triumph. Peace there can never be.
but war may be carried to nobler heights
and robbed of its horror of graves and ruin.
When by organisation, zeal and great stead-
fastness the Allies have broken forever the
German menace the goal will still be la
away. World-safety from world-murder wu
still remain a myth until the vast eonserip
tion of all the world’s intelligence has
pressed humanity into the ranks of thos
who must fight the mental war of the ra
to a finish. The dove will never get a per-
manent roosting-place while food and she
remain the only hope and dream of millions
of thinking minds.
THE CONFUSION OF FIGURES ABOUT

tiie dreadful confusion which is P ie ' 1 . ,
all over the Commonwealth rests e ,
with the Federal Government. 10 D \?

others. A succinct statement should
been placed in the hands of every e e
a crystallisation of the position which

the bewildered elector turns f loa . t j,
strange sum to another and finds the ,

additions and subtractions assist th


in coming to erroneous conclusions. It is a
wicked thing for members of the Federal
Government to suggest that the citizen who,
on the basis of figures officially dribbled
forth at odd times, arrives at wrong conclu-
sions, is trying to deceive his neighbor. The
business of the Government should be to make
it impossible for anyone to be wrong in his
facts. It has not attended to this. There-
fore people honestly struggling to get at the
truth deceive themselves and one another.
* * * *
Take the case of last week’s Australian
Worker. It proved to its own satisfaction
that during 12 months, October, 1916, to
September, 1917, there was an excess of en-
listments over casualties numbering 18,404.
It is probable that nine men out of 10 read-
ing the article will believe it to reflect the
truth. About its good faith there is no rea-
son to entertain a doubt. Its honesty is, in
fact, pathetic, and its invitation to someone
to prove, on the basis of the figures pro-
duced, where the voluntary system has been
a failure is almost tragic in its childish
reliance upon its calculations. The Worker
takes a summary of the enlistments, as
supplied by the Defence Department, from
October, 1916, to September, 1917. It adds
them up and finds 56,470. Then it takes
another summary of casualties abroad, Sep-
tember, 1916, to October, 1917. It is an
incomplete summary if October 31 is meant;
but let that pass. After making allowance
for the wounded men returning to duty, the
sick men who have become convalescent, the
dead and the missing, the figures show gross
casualties 88,717 reduced to 59,046. Then
by a process of exclusion, casualties for
September, 1916, and October, 1917(20,980),
being disregarded in order to make the en-
listment months coincide with the months
for which casualties are reckoned, the Worker
gets this: Casualties for 14 months, 59,046,
less 20,950 for two months, equals 38,066
for 12 months. Then by taking away this
38,066 from the . 56,470 enlistments, a sur-
plus is shown of 18,404, and the triumphant
verdict is arrived at that for 12 months the
enlistments averaged 4705 and the losses
3172. The simple answer to all this is that
the figures are worthless for the reason that
the number of enlistments does not represent
the number of men available for reinforce-
ments ; and fiddling about with unreliable
figures for arbitrarily selected periods and
excluding some in order to use others is
mere foolishness. The only really useful
point about the enlistment figures is that
they show a decline from 4575 in January to
2450 in September.
There is no need to go groping about in
this way. We must deal with the whole
business and not with mere scraps of it.
Only then shall we see how far the volun-
tary system can be relied upon. When Min-
ister for Defence Pearce stated in Sydney
on October 31 that 383,000 men had enlisted
and 313,000 had gone oversea he laid the
foundations for a lot of trouble. Up to Octo-
ber 31 the number of men who had enlisted
in Australia was, it is true, 383.000. But, of
these, 67,857 had been struck off the strength
for various reasons. Of the remainder,
298,436 had embarked for oversea service,
leaving 16,707 in training. Now, when
Ryan and others, taking 383,000 as the total
force available, subtracted the casualties
reported up to October 31, they were
making two errors —(1) they did not drop
the 67,857 to begin with, and (2) the re-
ported casualties did not represent the
actual number of mishaps at the Front. It
takes time to get details of these. The army
is not fighting at Woolloomooloo. Of the
298,436 soldiers sent from Australia, 34,731
are dead and 4502 missing, and 42,988 have
returned to their homes. That accounts for
82,221, and leaves the strength of the army
oversea at 216,215. At full strength the
divisions in France would be 112,000. In
Egypt and Palestine there were on October
31 a total of 17.270. On the same date,
17,016 men were on their way back to Aus-
tralia or awaiting passage. That accounts
for 146,286, leaving 69,929 to be accounted
for. And they are accounted for this way.
There were in England 71,809, including
hospital cases and resting men. But the
divisions in France were at 104,395 instead
of 112,000; that is, they were 7605 short.
Take that 7605 from the 71,809 and add
5745 who were en route to England or
Egypt, and there is 69,949 accounted for. or
a score too many, who may have been dis-
covered somewhere else or got into the
accounts when nobody was looking. An
armv is a moving thing, with men continu-
allv falling sick, being transported from one
place to another and generally subject to
continual wastage and requiring a consider-
able base establishment, wherefore of the
71809 men in England on October 31 no
more than 40,000 to 45,000 were sound, and
of these no more than 20,000 or so were
available at any moment for reinforcement.
How long would that last? Three months!
And would the 16,707 in training in Aus-
tralia be readv in tliat time for the field.
And does voluntary enlistment at a rate
approximating a fourth of the wastage look
like keeping up the supply? The bitter truth
is that, unless more men are forthcoming,
the divisions in France will begin to break
at Easter. There is no other possible con-
clusion. „ ,

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Devastating Campaigns of General
Muddle.
Tiie public should soon begin to hear how
much longer the irrigation scheme at Yanco
is to be a drain on the taxpayers pocket;
for the citizens of N. S. Wales are not going
to be in a position much longer to indulge in
the luxury of maintaining even one sink to
pitch the national earnings or borrowings
into. The scheme was launched 10 years
ago with much oratory. Hot-air prospec-
tuses were issued, settlers inveigled, and
money thrown round in hatfuls. . The net
result of it all to-day is an enterprise repre-
senting a capital investment of ±4,524 ; 017.
Ihe assets consist of land, reservoirs, roll-
ing stock, buildings, and so on, including
losses on revenue account. In the last two
years these losses have amounted to £331.737,
due, in part, of course, to interest on works
under construction. But there have been
heavy and continuous losses on established
undertakings. During last financial year
there were trading deficiencies under 35
headings, the aggregate being £26,933. Profit
was made out of a store and a nursery, but
everything else handled in connection with
this huge enterprise resulted in loss. There
were losses on the stud bull, growing veg-
etables, dealing in fence posts, making
houses, generating electrical power, killing
animals and all the rest of it. The State
runs abattoirs. The loss in 1916 was £lOBO :
in 1917, £1899. If labor and power had
cost Od. and no allowance had been made for
depreciation, the loss last year would have
been only £450. There is also a bacon-
factory. The loss in 1916 was £743; in
1917, £l4ll. Here, also, if labor and poAver
had been given for nothing and no deprecia-
tion allowed, the business would have been
a loser. The explanation is that more was
handed out for the live pig than was got
for the animal when it appeared as bacon.
The butter factory made losses of £1420
down to 1915; in 1916 it went behind a
further £672 ; last year, £212. Accumulated
losses, £2304. The deficit is apparently due
to two things—over-capitalisation and pay-
ment to suppliers of more than the net
receipts. The canning factory deserves to
be approached with hats off. The buildings
and plant cost £16,144. The place up to the
last stock-taking had been running years.
Successive losses, £55, £lOB5, £1959,” £9577.
A. C. Cakmichael, acting as a Royal Com-
missioner, reported in 1915 that the factory
had proved a failure because of the smail
amount of material available, and left it to
be inferred that if worked at full canacity
of output (£11,4751 the affair would be a
great success. Well, last year the factory
went right up to full capacity, handling raw
material valued at £13,196, and the dreadful
story of what happened is that for every
£lOO of marketable commodity produced for
the State £99 9s. 2d. had been spent on raw
material and hardware to pack it in. Thus
practically every penny spent in preparing,
packing and marketing £21,000 worth of
fruit, vegetables and sugar became a charge
on the taxpayer. Yet, despite this calamitous
result, there is a project for spending addi-
tional thousands on a bigger factory. Now,
what is the justification for all this? Butter
factories, bacon-curing establishments and
canneries are conducted profitably by Pri-
vate and Co-operative Enterprise all over
the Commonwealth. At Yanco they are
merely barnacles fastened on the public
cash-box. If the object is to show that pub-
lic control is a mockery—that everything
said against it is true —then the N. S. Wales
experiments at Yanco have been a triumph-
ant success. If that is not the object, will
the Government oblige with a few remarks
explanatory of what it is trying to do, what
it thinks of the mess so far, and whether it
is pledged to go blundering on until the last
shilling has evaporated? Muddle does not
describe the condition of affairs at Yanco.
It is plain chaos.
You Can Make This a Lie.
From the 17 volumes bound in faded calf
which represent Hermann MacHinden-
uurg’s monumental work on the “Great
European War,” published in 1986 : —
So equal were the forces now opposed on the
Front between Ostend and Ghent and so completely
exhausted were the war resources of the nations
that the fate of the world hung as on a nicely-
adjusted balance. The Teutonic empires had with-
drawn slightly at various points from their original
lines, but in doing so had forced their enemies to
make an enormous expenditure of life and munitions.
The war might have long ago ended in compromise,
but the moral issues at stake were too great for
any adjustment of rival aims; and the determination
of both sides to push the matter to a definite con-
clusion led to the final battle in which it was in-
evitable that one army or the other must break
through, and in breaking through secure the fruits
of victory.
The seven days’ engagement appeared entirely
favorable to the British arms; and when through
the battered and ruined defences of the Prussian
troops the Australian divisions were finally hurled,
the end appeared to have come. Thin files of gaunt,
grey men, sinewed by years of exile and hardship,
followed with the precision learned of long practice
the barrage that once more swept the blackened
and pitted ground, and threw themselves with splen-
did valor upon the opposing trenches and block-
houses. After a desperate fight against heavy odds
they secured their objectives and waited for the
reinforcements which might have turned their suc-
cess into final victory. It was the critical moment;
but the only possible Australian reinforcements were
at the other side of the globe! Storm troops suit-
able for the purpose were unavailable; and the
Prussian field command, which had been gloomily
preparing for the retreat, suddenly grasping the
situation, threw in the last German reserves!
How the Australians died in that vaster new
Thermopylae is a tale too well known to be repeated
here. German prestige was saved, German victory
assured; and to-day, as we look back over the
progress of the Germanic world, we have cause to
thank the fortunes of war that the Australian nation
had previously decided to abstain from further aug-
menting the British fighting forces. All honor to
the voters of that far Commonwealth —now an in-
tegral portion of the Teutonic empire—for their far-
sighted wisdom! Had another 10 thousand Aus-
tralians been available on the Ostend-Ghent Front,
the whole history of the world must have been re-
written ; and the foolish British myth of democratic
freedom and individual liberty would still have
been retarding the pfogress of Prussian civilisation.

Mobilisation of Women.
W. M. Htjghes suggests as a piece of Win-
the-War strategy the mobilisation of Aus-
tralian women. The thing is a bit vague,
and it is doubtful whether the Primp
Minister himself has any notion on
the subject beyond the immediate effect
to be produced by another mouthful
of words. Conscription of women for
the direct work of the Commonwealth
could be understood, though a referendum
taken on the question would be a fearsome
thing to contemplate; but mobilisation could
mean anything or nothing, and for that
reason alone has its political uses. Still, there
are a very large number of things that women
might easily combine to do to lighten the
burden of Australia, and so indirectly help
to win the war. One of these would be to
tackle boldly and definitely the problem of
dress. The drain on the resources of the
community through male extravagances is
less serious because from beer to trousers the
majority of man’s demands can be met by
Australian labor. Even if he drinks im-
ported whisky, the bulk of his spending stays
in the country, because duties on spirits are
on a scale out of all proportion to the
manufactured value of the liquids. Such
is not the case with feminine adornment.
Woman’s desire to glitter before her fellows
and outdo them in style keeps the door open
for the importer, and is the mainstay of
the fight or passive resistance or whatever
it may be against effective protection of Aus-
tralian industry. If women would fairly
mobilise to fight this thing after mobilising
their intelligence to understand what it
means, there should be something doing. But
the real don’t-win-the-war aspect of the femi-
nine problem is idleness. If Conscription is
carried, men who have no family responsi-
bilities and are under the age of 45 will
have to fight; why should women up to the
age of 40 who have borne no children not
have to work? The real victory of Aus-
tralia depends upon our maintaining our
economic life with the left hand while we
reach out at the Kaiser with the right. At
present there are a vast number of young,
childless women, who do nothing whatever
for their country, shrieking scorn at the men
shirkers who won’t enlist. It never occurs
to these nice girls that they, too, are shirkers
or that, with a big war on hand, a woman’s
duty might run to something more than
afternoon-tea chatter and a smile. The
mobilisation of all the mass of assorted idle
femininity that so often blocks the business
arteries of Sydney and Melbourne with mere
inanity would turn many wheels and add a
lot to the wealth production of the Common-
wealth. Admiration of the Russihn women
who actually went into the scrap ran high
around the cakes-and-tea : but why not emu-
late them by tackling the equally-valuable
job called work? If Hughes, instead of
vaguely hinting at female mobilisation, had
declared his intention of eliminating idle-
ness, both male and female, as long as Bill-
,tim was suffering in the trenches, his would
have been a statesmanlike word with a long
echo down the future years.
Australia First? Well, Show It!
When you have read the report of a com-
mittee appointed by the Speck’s Assembly
you cease to wonder why the rich and
pleasant little island can’t keep its popula-
tion. In the 10 years prior to 1914 every
other State of the Commonwealth showed an
excess of immigration over emigration ; Tas-
mania alone exhibited a loss—for every 100
who arrived 111 cleared out; and that was
before the war. The committee, roaming
amongst Government departments, discovered
that a policy of systematically ignoring
Tasmanian and even Australian products
had been rampant. It wasn’t even pre-
tended that the local goods had been tested
and found wanting: simply they were locally
made and therefore they were damned :
As an instance of the general attitude of Depart-
ments the case of Tasmanian-manufactured locks
may be taken. It is established beyond any doubt
that the State has in Launceston the finest lock
factory to be found in the Commonwealth, and that
the product of that factory is not excelled by any
imported article; yet the proprietors have received
scant encouragement from the Government Depart-
merits. This attitude may be contrasted with that
of Commonwealth Departments, which place large
orders for these locks, and with the South Australian
Government, which in its contracts generally speci-
fies Jackson's locks, whereas our contracts, bv
limiting the price of locks to the present maximum,
positively excludes the use of our own local product.
The committee recommends that a prefer-
ence of 15 per cent, be granted in all cases
to Tasmanian products; and though that
may mean a sort of State duty against the
products of the rest of Australia, it also means
a super-tax on foreign goods, and for that
reason may be allowed to pass. Yet we
need something more than taxes and super-
taxes. We need a better spirit of patriot-
ism. We need to cultivate the feeling that
when we contemptuously turn down Aus-
tralian products because they are Australian
and can’t be as good as those made by other
men, we throw an insult into the teeth of
those Australians who have won glory for us
in Gallipoli and France and Palestine and
Flanders. Behind it all is a species of
snobbery—that snobbery which loves to
masquerade as English or something that
isn’t Australian. Before the war it was
even prepared to be German. Now and then
and here and there English people have
urged us to be proud to be ourselves; and
if Governor-Generals and Governors and the
like took that as a text for a fortnightly
sermon, we might almost be prepared to say
that they were earning their keep. This at
least is a job which the imported person of
social tonnage can do better than anybody
else; and this paper commends it to every
Government House in Australia.
Another War Cloud.
“Bad Australian,” from the neighborhood
of the Andes :
Ever since the sinking of the Monte Protegido
Buenos Aires has “demonstrated” in the plazas and
before the Casa Rosada; it has burst up German
business houses and newspaper offices, and foamed in
the face of the Hun, and it has only been restrained
from lynching several prominent Germans by the
intervention of armed guards. When the Yankee
squadron under Admiral Caperton arrived in the
port at the end of July the city gave the marineros
Norte Americanos the most frantically enthusiastic
reception ever witnessed in this tropical country.
The squadron stayed a week or more, and the crews
were on the free list all the time. When the Ger-
man representative saw how badly Argentina had
torn her neutrality in permitting the warships to
stay so long, instead of immediately tossing his hat
into the ring he went quietly off to the Cordobe
Hills, where he stayed until the Yankee ships were
hull-down for Rio. Now, Chile requires very little
encouragement from the Hun or anyone else where
war with Argentina is concerned. The boundary dis-
pute in the ’nineties was a mere bagatelle compared
with the real grievance. No good Chilean ever for-
gets that his country was jockeyed out of the Cuyo
Provinces (Mendoza and San Juan), which were
originally part of the Vicereynato de Chile, and he
will never be satisfied until those two rich provinces
are once more included in Chilean territory. So the
day is fast approaching when an army of the most
demoniacal and absolutely reckless fighters on the
planet will swarm over the undefended passes of the
Andes and take by force that which was lost to
them through the superior astuteness of the Argen-
tines ; and this army is trained on the German sys-
tem, and largely officered by Huns or Chileans of
Hunnish blood. Chile has just acquired six new
submarines. The land armaments have been con-
siderably strengthened, and Chilean policy in respect
to Europe and South America leaves the Government
to act as seems best. War is inevitable, and if it
comes before the end of the European tragedy every
Hunnish reservist in S’America will head for Chile.
Not out of any overweening love for the Chilean or
hatred for the Argentine, but simply to take part in
the destruction of Argentine public works, which are
mostly owned or financed by the Allies. And when
red war swings over the Andes, the Chilean legions
will be joyfully received by thousands of their com-
patriots, who live under Argentine rule, scattered
throughout the rich valleys of the foothills from
Magallanes to Salta.

The most unpleasant row in Queensland
over the admission of a new Arbitration
Court judge to the Supreme Court bench
raises the question whether we are not mak-
ing a mistake in looking for high legal
attainments in the men who handle this in-
dustrial business. Samuel Griffith, who
would ornament any bench of judges, would
probably make a poor president of an Arbi-
tration Court; and if Justice Higgins had
acquired less law he might have had time to
learn a lot of other things he doesn’t know.
When the N. S. Wales Arbitration Court
was hatched it happened that there was
on the N. S. Wales Supreme Court bench a
Hebrew who, besides being a Hebrew, had
spent years in business; and he was made
Arbitration judge. After that, because the
government is practically in the hands of
lawyers, it was assumed that, a judge hav-
ing been the first president, any lawyer who
was good enough to be a judge was good
enough to be president of an Arbitration
Court. There was a whole lot of arbitra-
tion done in Australia long before the name
of Arbitration Court was invented. It was
done by goldfields wardens ; and the best of
them were men who knew neither Coke nor
Black'stone. But they did know human
nature and what was a fair thing, and some
of their best decisions were given from a
perch on a log.
♦
If the law courts of Australia want to
maintain public respect they will have to
mend their ways. Twelve months ago, dur-
ing the Conscription campaign of 1916,
some of them behaved so badly that their
conduct was d public scandal. Now they
have been invited, besides finding whether
certain persons before them are guilty or
not, to make a finding as to certain facts.
The evidence given as to those facts has
been absurdly inadequate. Men who have
no first-hand knowledge, and could only speak
in vague terms, have been put up as the
principal witnesses; and of this flimsy stuff
magistrates have made their extra-judicial
findings. This won’t do. The Bulletin
is as anxious to get Conscription as anybody :
it was fighting for it years before the peace of
the world was broken. But it isn’t necessary to
destroy public confidence in the impartiality
and thoroughness of our courts to get it. The

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Faint and distant, sweet and slow,
Through the traffic’s ebb and flow —
Wheels that come and wheels that go—
Fife and drum
Hither come,
Making every man a scorner
Of all else a little space,
As he hears, with glowing face,
Music marching round the corner.
Little children quit their play;
Dame and damsel throng the way;
Young and old, and grave and gay,
Haste to hear,
Sweet and clear,
Underneath the azure arching
Of our glorious Southern sky,
Keen of ear and glad of eye.
Music round the corner marching.
Who are these that come in pride,
Grave and gracious, side by side,
Loose of arm and free of stride,
Four by four,
Score by score,
Every man a careless scorner
Of the shafts that Death might fling?
Hark, the band is answering :
“Anzaes marching round the corner!”
Neighbors, give them room to pass !
Some are weak and pale, alas,
Shot and shell and ghastlv gas
Worked them woe ;
As they go,
Underneath the azure arching
Of our stainless Southern sky,
We behold with inward eye
Glory round the corner marching!
Children, when the guns are still,
And the Ghoul has had his fill,
Music shall not fail to thrill,
Drawing near.
Sweet and clear;
Though our land be still a mourner
Of her sons who bled and died,
We shall hail with joy and pride
Peace that marches round the corner.
Children, in your garden plots
Plant the blue forget-me-nots,
See that in your window-pots
Roses climb
’Gainst the time
When, beneath the azure arching
Of this radiant land of ours.
Ye shall greet with palms and flowers
Peace around the corner marching.

The German Turns West.
Tiie question now is not whether the Allies
can smash the German hdld upon Flanders
and Northern France by direct assault, but
whether they can resist the enemy’s attack.
The things that happened early this year on
the Somme, then northward of Arras, and
lately towards Cambrai have each in their
turn indicated the tremendous difficulties in
the way of handing disaster to the enemy.
It now has to be seen whether liberation of
the armies hitherto pinned down to the east-
ern frontier will so strengthen the German
on the West as to make it possible for him
to hand disaster to us—to start another
Verdun, and succeed. The inducements for
him to try are considerable, and he certainly
has a greater chance of scoring by direct
action at once than by holding back until the
American gets into proper fighting trim. If
the Allies have been hard to beat in the West
up tiil now, they must certainly be more
difficult to get rid of when the Stars and
Stripes arrive. Conversely, if the British
and French have found the German lines
unpleasantly, formidable in the nast, it is
only reasonable to expect that, reinforced by
the hardened divisions previously employed
somewhere else, Fritz will in future be
vastly more difficult to deal with than ever.
The net result of the Russian debacle has
been to immensely shorten the German line
and put the Kaiser in the position of being-
able to concentrate almost the xvhole mili-
tary force of the Fatherland on Belgium and
France. It gives to Austria the same free-
dom of action against Italy. The longer all
this is look d at the more dismal it seems,
for there is something more than a possi-
bility of the Russian collapse affording Ger-
many material advantages of almost incalcu-
lable value. If Germany could burst through
to Calais and Paris —well, it might be possi-
ble to keep on talking about winning the
war, but that would be about all. That a
gigantic effort will be made by Von llinden-
burg to do this thing can hardly
be doubted. Meanwhile there is news of the
capture of Jerusalem. The feat means some-
thing, but the capture of a hundred Jeru-
salems would not be an effective counter-
poise to the alarmingly changed situation in
Europe. There never was a time when Aus-
tralia could turn back with less unpleasant
consequences. If Britain and the Allies were
winning it would not look so bad if Aus-
tralia did say that it had done enough. But
to pull out and desert its mates just when it
looks as if the other side is winning would
make Australila seem like a cocktail and
like everything else that it isn’t.

Randolph Bedford writes
Here’s for the carving of “Cato” (B. 29/11/’l7),
who argues like a boob and lies like a gas-meter.
I didn’t write of “Ryan and Ilis Mates” from “the
luxury of a seat in the Leg. Council” ; as The
Bulletin knows, my appreciation of this Govern-
ment was written before I ever thought of appoint-
ment, and because of my accession to the throne
The Bulletin wisely cut out a column or so of
my remarks on the Opposition in the Assembly. My
belief in the Ryan Government as the first really Aus-
tralian Government I have known has nothing to do
with my own position or want of it. I have been
writing for years against the diffident Australian
habit of giving the best public positions in Aus-
tralia’s gift to incurable immigrant politicians—
rowdy Welshmen, cold Ulsterites, blatant Cockneys.
Says the mean and stupid “Cato” :
They have no rivals for pride of place as good-
nay, even the best —Australians, if being Australian
means being unconcerned with the greatest feature
of our life to-day, the war. The Cabinet has more
concern for cheap chops than for the great question
of reinforcements.
Both as statement and suggestion this is false.
Almost every man in that Government has men of
his blood fighting; every sick Tory has told the
Government that the war is in the hands of the
Commonwealth; everybody must know that screech-
ing methods of war-winning could never appeal to
the hard-headed Australians of the Queensland Gov-
ernment. And how did it help the German to cut
down the price of meat to the Australian at home
and the Allies abroad ?
Says “Cato” again: “No Minister has come for-
ward and urged the cause of reinforcements.” A
lie 1 Both Premier Ryan and Lands Minister
Hunter have done so, and their appearance on the
recruiting platform was used as an opportunity to
insult them.
Conscription can be “mentioned within a mile”
of our haunt. It is mentioned in Parliament almost
every day—in words of contumely. And we Antis
are honest enough about it. My son will vote “No,”
and to bring him back again to-morrow I would not
vote “Yes.” I respect the honest opponent; but how
can a man have anything but contempt for the poli-
ticians who dirty Conscription and discourage
recruiting by using them as vehicles for insulting
the Government of the State as pro-Germans and
traitors ?
“Cato” discovers that what is wrong with the
Government is “funk,” whereas these Ministers know
less of that than anything. They settled a Railway
strike without giving away any of the law ; settled it
so well and yet without compromise that the men had
no dirty taste left in the mouth and could not now
be got to leave work without dynamite. “It is
difficult,” says the boob with the Roman name, “to
understand how any democrat such as Bedford was
can find satisfaction in such a position. Government
of the people by the people—where is it in Queens-
land to-day?” It is just because Bedford is the
democrat he always has been that he finds satisfac-
tion. Where is government by the people in Queens-
land to-day ? Reposed in an all-Australian Govern-
ment with such a majority of quality and quantity
that the mean, futile, impotent Opposition looks like
three-penn’orth of peanuts by comparison. The
Ryan Government has stayed good in intention and
made good in achievement. Its work has iriade its
return to power a certainty—-as any Queenslander
not mad with the envy of opposed politics will
admit —and it deserves well of its country.
♦
Dear Bulletin, —I am happy to say I did
not lose my £SO deposit. It was bad enough
to be donkey-licked, but to have lost a
“monkey” would have been simply germanic!
Tempered with vitriol mixed with nitric
acid, my opinion of the Victorian election as
it concerned me is as follows: —
(1) Party Government is stronger than ever. Two
new caucuses have entered the electoral arena —the
Farmers’ Union .and the Returned Soldiers’. The
farmer's pledge is infinitely more binding than the
Labor pledge. A cocky M.L.A. dare not blow his
nose in Parliament House without asking permis-
sion of his Council of Ten. The soldiers are organis-
ing a strong political army, and will exercise power-
ful influence at all Parliamentary elections.
(2) State politics have lost interest with the
public, whose worship of the cult of incompetence
will open the doors of all Parliament Houses wider
to mediocre and voluble men.
(3) The oncoming financial avalanche —that drop-
sical interest bill caused by the difference between
borrowing 30 years ago at 31 per cent, and renewing
next year and the following years at 51 per cent.—
has not yet been perceived either by the electors or
by the Parliamentary fossils who have to find the
increased interest by more taxation.
(4) Primary production of milk, eggs, butter,
meat, rabbits and wool is not able by itself and its
own development to pay this inflated interest bill.
This country more insistently needs a protecting Pro-
tective tariff than ever it did before.
Borrowing for railways must stop peremp-
torily. In six years Victoria has spent
£10,000,000 on new railways, and during the
same period 154,000 people have sold out and
left the country districts to live in Mel-
bourne. The older country districts of Vic-
toria are simply decaying. The fences are
worn out, the houses dilapidated, the sani-
tation quite suitable for blackfellows, and
the poor shabby villages fit only for the fire-
stick. Outside Melbourne, if it were not for
the splendid children and live stock, one
would say Victoria was dying from gan-
grene. It is really only suffering from a
hopeless attempt to carry an impossible
burden of railway and other debt and an
equally impossible burden of metropolitan
parasites.—Yours, G. D. Meudell.
The “Advisory Council of Science and Indus-
try” continues to tell the Commonwealth
Government how to employ Australians at
jobs formerly done by foreigners; and the
Government continues to talk about repatria-
tion and borrowed millions, while returned
Billjim goes round raffling his watch to keep
himself in tucker. Lately the council has
been considering potash, the control of which
blind, Freetrade Britain allowed to fall
wholly into German hands; and it finds (1)*
that we want potash chiefly as a fertiliser;
(2) that roasted alunite provides the very
best potash for this purpose; and (3) that
there are three well-known deposits of alu-
nite in Australia, one of them, at Bulladelah
(N.S.W.), most favorably situated. But —
The ultimate success of this industry depends on
the treatment to be accorded to the German Potash
Syndicate in the future. If the German imports are
stopped, or the supply of potash is not available as
at present, then alunite offers... .quick production
of a high-grade product at a reasonable outlay with
every guarantee of success.
But instead of erecting a tariff which would
stop the imports, the Government merely
lets off hot-air about xmgue schemes of re-
patriation and “organisation of industry,”
with nothing but loans and debt and Govern-
ment jobs in the distance.
After many years of waiting, Victoria has
unearthed a Minister of Works who told
deputations from three rich municipal shires,
one after the other, to go back home and raise
the money on their own security to make
new roads. This successor of George Turner
is an ex-chairman of the Stock Exchange
of Melbourne, John McWhae, M.L.C. He
scarified a Bacchus Marsh deputation with
such plain language that it withdrew with-
out thanking him according to time-honored
usage. Bacchus Marsh is one of the coun-
cils which have acquired the bad habit of
getting the Works Department to not only
make but maintain all the main roads through
their territory. It ought to have a new
valuation based on the wonderful returns
its very fertile land has been yielding of late
years; and then, with an honest rate, it
wouldn’t have to come as a beggar to the
city. It is the plain dishonesty of most of
the valuations which alone gives these rich
councils the nerve to hold out the hat.
A matter for inquiry :
The finding of a lifebuoy branded Aurora near
Tacking Point (N.S.W.) seems to settle the question
as to the fate of the vessel, which left Sydney four
months ago. She was built as a whaler in 1876 and
gained fame as Shackleton’s ship on his journey to
the Antarctic. On that expedition she got a bad
doing in the ice; but the dire shortage of tonnage
led to her being put into commission again recently.
After being given a costly overhaul in Maoriland
she was despatched to Newcastle (N.S.W.), where
she loaded coal. Leaving there in June she opened
out at sea and staggered into Sydney, where she was
overhauled some more and sailed with 21 souls on
board. Evidently- she wasn’t sturdy enough after her
pinching in the ice floes to carry- a coal cargo, and
the people who certified that she was are no doubt
now feeling a pain in the seat of their judgment.
The ship was not much loss, but the drowning of 21
men is another matter. Captain Reeves, the master,
was a highly-skilled navigator, and he had with
him five certificated officers and an all-British crew.
Scarcity of shipping means that some risks are bound
to be taken, but the ocean isn’t exactly like a race-
course, where anyone is at perfect liberty- to back a
50 to 1 chance.
“Mercy” : The idea that it is the duty of
soldiers to fight seems to be fading farther
and farther into the distance. So many
other things have been discovered for them to
do that presently the fighting soldier will be
looked upon as a disorderly person and put
into clink. The latest development is the
appointment of martial Beau Brummels who
walk about the streets giving fashion hints
to figtiting men who wear the wrong tie and
commit horrible excesses of that sort.
Apparently it is no nart of these exquisites’
duty to round up and clean the occasional
dusty soldier who gets on the spree and
rolls in the gutter. Yet one of this sort
creates more real annoyance than a bat-
talion of collar-and-cuff offenders. The
other Saturday night a beer-drenched war-
rior, wearing the dirtiest uniform I have
ever seen and the sickly pallor of repent-
ance, stumbled into a tram and wedged him-
self between two expensive evening frocks.
No doubt he had passed by many military
fashion-platers—or the fashion-platers had
passed by him. That shows that what is
really wanted is a sort of military boudoir
on wheels, which would trundle round the
city and provide complete clean changes for
untidy revellers.
“Fitzroy”: Queensland’s Wando Yale
affair provided a sensational sequel the other
morning, when Thomas Francis Connor, a
Central Queensland grazier and cattle-
dealer, was found dead alongside a hayrick
at TVycarbah, 20 miles from Rockhampton,
with a Winchester bullet through his brain.
It was Connor who made the assertion in
a Cloncurry pub that State Treasurer Theo-
dore had raked off £SOOO from the Wando
Yale station deal, and he was later haled
before a Royal Commission to give details.
After the Commission’s finding, Theodore
issued a writ for £SOOO against him, and
this seems to have preyed on his mind until
he apparently resolved to disnense with
pleaders and interpleaders, and took his
troubles to the last Court of Appeal. Con-
nor was one of the many Bananaland stock-
men whom the boom of recent years in
sheep and cattle lifted out of the ruck,
and because he was a decent sort his tragic
death will cause regret to all connected with
the affair.
As one of the most successful company-
managers in Melbourne, Alec Peacock, late
Premier, ought to be able to give the State
some invaluable information. Last year,
among other public enterprises, the Won-
thaggi coal-mine lost £20,630, the various
experimental farms £IO,OOO and the Wil-
liamstown shipbuilding yard £11,266. If
these three things xvere run by cos. in Pea-
cock’s office he would expect to see an
aggregate profit of from £50.000 to £100.000;
and the State is surely entitled to know
from him why. when he ran them as
Premier, they showed a loss of £42.000.
The Earl of Portsmouth is dead, at 62.
He is succeeded by his brother, John Fel-
lowes Wallop—that’s the family name—who
was private sec. to Sir George Strahan.
Governor of Tasmania. 1881-86. As Earl
of Portsmouth Jack Wallop will be Heredi-
tary Bailiff of Burnley in the New Forest,
owner of about 66,000 acres, patron of seven
livings, with a seat in Hampshire and
another in Devonshire. As Gov. Strahan’s
sec. he had £250 a year.
Mathew Henry, second son of Alfred
Stephen, one time Chief Justice of N. S.
Wales, passed into his 90th year last week
His father died at 93. Mathew Henry, born
m Hobart Town, was the first native-born
admitted to the Bar of N. S. Wales.

had no recent equal in the office excent
perhaps Allen Taylor. Most of his wealth
has come from pubs and ponies; he has
handled both with extraordinary success. R n
Meagher, whom he succeeds, never lost sight
of the dearest object of his life—his restom
tion to the roll of solicitors—but it didn't
stop him from being a success in the rabbit 1
skins just as he was in the Speaker’s robes.
"J.H.M.A.” looks backward :
General Allenby, who has taken over the job
which Richard Plantagenet and other people of the
day before yesterday found too much for them be-
came well known to some Australians during’ the
S’African disagreement. In the Ist Cavalry Brigade
were the Gth Dragoons (Inniskillings), the 2nd Dra-
goons (Scots Greys) and the 6th Dragoon Guards
(Carabiniers). To the Inniskillings was attached
a squadron of the N. S. Wales Lancers, and the
Greys had to bear with a similar unit of the
writer’s corps, the old Ist Australian Horse, raised
in 1897 by Kenneth Mackay, of Wallendbeen.
Allenby was a Major in the Inniskillings—a hard-
looking, keen horseman, a fine soldier, beloved of his
own men, and respected and admired by the Aus-
tralians. For some time he was Brigade-Major to
“Uncle Tom” Porter, O.C. the brigade. He was
conspicuous amongst field-officers by a total lack of
personal adornment and a somewhat shabby uni-
form. One morning, on outpost, just as the dawn
was breaking and it became permissible to light up,
the shyest man we had, one of Sam McCaughev's
drovers, seeing an ill-dressed person standing in
front of our horses and peering into the dim twilight
of the awakening veldt, and taking him for one of
our own, slapped him cheerfully on the back, sav-
ing, “Got a match, Cocky?” He nearly
fainted when Allenby turned round with a grin, and
held out a box:- “Help your self!” “Blime!”
said little Jimmy afterwards, “a fine bloke—you’d
think he wcs one of us.” On another occasion we
were “standing to” our dejected horses in the lines
outside Kroonstad while General French inspected
them. As the little man rode along he saw the
Major, and called out in his cheerful fashion, “Hullo,
Allenby, how are you?” “Ah,” remarked an Aus-
tralian, “Johnny knows a man when he sees him.”
William Aird. passed out at Woodville
(S.A.) in his 78tli year, was a brother of
John, who built the famous Assouan dam on
the Nile. William, who lost heavily in
mining speculation, lived in retirement for
many years, giving his attention to flori-
culture.
“Vella’s’’ tribute :
Went West at Brisbane recently, Harry Martin,
after an adventurous life. Born at Weymouth
(Eng.), Martin early joined the navy, in which he
served for 10 years, most of the time in the old
Philomel, on the East Indies Station, where slave-
running in the Persian Gulf was the principal
religion. On his discharge Martin joined the London
police, but was soon afloat again, first on a lightship
and later on merchant vessels. Then a period in
California in many and varied occupations before he
drifted to the South Seas, where the last 30 years
of his life were spent. For part of the time he lived in
the then German possessions, and his contemptuous
view’s on Germans in general and German officialdom
in particular led to a trumped-up case being brought
against him at Rabaul. He was sentenced to five
months’ imprisonment. Before leaving the court he
addressed himself to the police-master, detailing
exactly what was going to happen to that function-
ary when the sentence had expired, and winding up by
catching the outraged official by the collar and plant-
ing his boot where it was most likely to aid propul-
sion. For this little pleasantry Martin had his sen-
tence extended to six months. On his release the
rebel went to the Solomons and settled down as a
trader and planter. He was the soul of hospitality
and a library of romances of the old, wild days in
the South Seas.
God knows it’s not much to be proud of.
but Ballarat is exulting because, for the firs!
time for 25 years, it has its representative
in the new Vic. Cabinet —Major Mat Baird.
Minister for Education. A coincidence is
that the last Ballarat portfolio-holder, Lt-
Col. W. C. Smith, was also a soldier —or
what passed for one in those peaceful days—
and Education Minister. Prior to that, nearly
every Ballarat man was in the Cabinet,
among them J. B. Humffray (the first
Mines Minister), TV. M. Iv. Vale, Dunky
Gillies. Peter Lalor. C. E. Jones (of “sw-
ages of Bnngaree” fame, afterwards expelled
the House), J. R. Bailey, John James and
Townsend McDermott.

Florence Young’s brief Red Widowhood
will last at Sydney Majesty’s until “The
B.ng Boys Are Here” —a coming event
which begins to cast a large shadow on the
hoardings. The public is threatened with a
gorgeous spectacle which will eclipse every-
thing yet seen, a glittering cast and 250
people on the stage. But this sort of thing
can be overdone. There was once a large,
crowded show which was slow on its numer-
ous feet. A polite first-night audience sat
tight and quiet until an exasperated back
stallite roared, “Everybody go off but the
little man with the red nose !” Then a tor-
rent of delighted applause crashed down.
The only thing lacking in the success of
“Cheating Cheaters,” the crookedest of crook
dramas at Sydney Criterion, is the importa-
tion of a crook audience from its home-land.
However, the management is considering the
question of special reductions to gaols. It
may also arrange theatre-parties'of burglars
and embezzlers.
On Saturday at the Sydney Opera House
Allan Wilkie will come to the end of his
“Seven Days’ Leave,” and on the following
Saturday “Robinson Crusoe” will arrive at
Rainbow Island.
“The Brokers,” a 40-minute laugh-getter,
is the latest streak of insanity on the Sydney
Tivoli bill. George Welch and Charles
Albert are in the middle of the streak, and
little Billy Rego drifts across it as an office
boy. Delmore and Lee, gymnasts, are still
in the air, and the joyous Camille Trio
resemble whirling war rumors on their hori-
zontal bars. Rogero, the mimic, Reynolds
and White, and Joe Reed, the Italian street
musician, are also present, and Alvin and
Williams manage to be there at roll-call.

Wherever you looked you saw youngsters
—they simply swarmed in Sydney Palace
on Saturday afternoon. They smiled at you
from the screen, 1300 of them, separately
and collectively; they shrieked from stalls
to gallery. Every one of them was enjoying
“Jack and the Beanstalk,” those who were
acting just as much as young Sydney-town
breathless over the make-believe. No pains
have been spared over the presentation of
this Fox film, and the result justifies even
the Press Agent. The part of Jack is taken
by Francis Carpenter, whose bearing is
enough to intimidate the real live giant of
Bft. 6in.; and Princess Virginia Lee Corbin
has given such an impetus to the bean-rais-
ing industry that Monty Somer should see
that she gets a gold medal from the A. and
P. Society.

Generally speaking, the lan Maclaren co.
is grotesquely unsuited t.o the faded mum-
mery of “David Garrick,” which was revived
at Melbourne King’s on Saturday. Except-
ing Souper and Greenaway, the party looks
a century too late for the period, and appears
to be embarrassed by the habits and clothes.
Simon Ingot's house-party is the oddest lot
that was ever gathered together for a social
evening. Mr. Browne, as Fred Kehoe
sees him, is a vision of Robespierre awaiting
the scaffold; Mrs. Smith, according to
Audrey Anderson, has a countenance resem-
bling an alcoholic stain; Mr. Smith (by
Fred McDonald) suffers from the one touch
of greasepaint that makes the whole face
grin ; Rubee Raymond overplays the gush of
Miss Browne, and Frederick Browne is too
green for the stutter of Mr. Jones. This
Waxwork collection gives no air of proba-
bility to the supposition that it is intimate
with the Ingot household, and, indeed, pulls
the play out of shape. lan Maclaren, who
has to register the bogus drunkenness of
Garrick for the purpose of disillusionising
the adoring Miss Ingot, is a more credible
figure, but even Maclaren has no idea of the
effect of port in large quantities, and his
fraud only serves to establish the actor-
hero’s reputation for sobriety. A. E. Green-
away, as Squire Chivy, is the only man who
is strictly at home with his epoch. He goes
arm in arm with the 18th century, so to
“David Garrick ,” at
Melbourne King's.
Fred McDonald as
Mr. Smith.
speak, and in his
excessively - thirsty
passage he talks
like a knut who is
genuinely wined.
Souper’s Simon
Ingot is courtly;
his daughter (Miss
Sutcliffe) affects a
sort of strangled
decorum quite out
of keeping with her
age and circum-
stance. The ancient
story of Garrick
and his foolish
sweetheart is pre-
ceded by the Trial
Scene from “The
Merchant of Ven-
ice,” in which Fred
Ivehoe, as a pleas-
ing Duke, gazes
upon an ill-as-
sorted body of liti-
gants. Souper is
right as Antonio,
and Greenaway’s
Bassanio is once
more a young man of immaculate diction.
But lan Maclaren is hereby handed a certifi-
cate of unfitness for the character of Shy-
lock on the grounds of incompatible tempera-
ment, voice and bearing. Aloreover, his
failure is heightened by an unlikely make-up
which is more reminiscent of a Thibetan
monk than a homicidal maniac of Hebrew
blood. Miss Sutcliffe’s Portia looks well in
her clamant scarlet, but otherwise the
character is poor in spirit and her elocution
is calling for help. The King’s closes on
Saturday to enable the carpenters to prepare
a gorgeous lodging for “Aladdin,” who is to
arrive on the 22nd.

At Melbourne Royal there is an air of
hushed expectancy, and the Firm’s press-
agent is making mysterious statements about
Hhe things that are to happen on Saturday
w T eek. It is positively known that Muriel
Starr is to be a Hawaiian belle in “The Bird
of Paradise,” but other promised marvels
continue to reside in the realm of giddy con-
jecture. Meantime Somerset Maugham will
mix the beerage and the peerage in a matri-
monial shandygaff for three more nights.
“Mrs.* Dot,” who represents the first ingredi-
ent, is still proudly alleging that a mob of
people have to get drunk before she can buy
a new frock. The Bulletin merely men-
tions this astonishing fact in order to re-
mark that her wardrobe would fill an in-
ebriates’ retreat about once every 10 minutes.
“You’re in Love,” at Melbourne Majesty’s,
has received notice to quit, as a young man
named “Dick Whittington,” with a large and
distinguished retinue, has leased the theatre
for a long term commencing on December 22.
Which reminds one that on the same date
the empty Princess’s will reopen to the sound
of a Cromwellian scrimmage called “For the
King.”
There is nothing fresh to report about the
Melbourne Tivoli this week barring the
reappearance of Marie Iving-Scott as the
shrewd rural damsel with the obliging sense
of humor. A further inspection of the
Satinettos gives improved impressions. The
pictures are built up of pieces of silk and
satin of various colors, and the arrangement
of the fragments amounts to a feat of
memory. Joseph Blascheck is repeating his
verbal snapshots with the helpful piano-
logues of Alyce Austin, whilst the droll
giggle of Ethel Vaugn is in the same place
as it was before. “The Beauty Shop.” how-
ever, remains the big item and continues to
arouse the bored with the tableau of Mabelle
Morgan turning vermilion in an electric
oven.

This week “The Barrier” is having a good
innings at the Melba Theatre, Melbourne,
where the “continuous” customer has a bias
for high explosives and heaps of slain. There
is a human fort in the picture; he is named
Dan Stark and is played by an American
with an amazing resemblance to our own
George Bryant. At the Britannia Mrs. Vernon
Castle and the second chapter of the serial,
“Patria,” held the screen for the first half of
the week. To-day little Enid Bennett comes
into view in “They’re Off,” an American
racing study of the quick and the dead.
Various eccentrics are enmeshed in “The
Cobweb” at Hoyt’s, Melbourne, this week.
The principal is a female earthquake who
refuses to remain quiet and causes fissures in
the hero’s domestic relations. Eventually
she is dropped in a lake to cool down, and
the hero, has to explain the corpse satisfac-
torily before his missus will pourparler for a
permanent peace. A plate of icecream,
entitled “The Girl Without a Soul,” follows
the foregoing disturbance, and sends every-
body away with a happy feeling. It is a
simple story in a minor key, with just enough
wickedness to keep the plot alive.

Ada Reeve, more of a finished artist than
ever, has had a strenuous week at Adelaide
Royal, with a Parliament House lunch and
a seat behind the Governor at a march-past
of troops as interludes. For this week the
Royal reverted to variety, but has now con-
tentedly gone back to pictures. The Majestic
keeps right on with variety. Denny and
Dunigan have proved so popular that their
season had to be extended, and another
striking turn is that in which Copeland, re-
turned soldier, does all the old thought-read-
ing feats. The fine old priest of Harrington
Reynolds has passed on from the Tivoli,
which is specialising for the moment in
“Dangerous Women.” Pierrots and Jesters
are in the open air on either side of North
Terrace—Sydney Hollister has taken a lease
of the Exhibition Gardens and has the
Pierrots; Branscombe is at the Austral
Gardens with the Jesters. And good con-
certs are past all numbering.
Walter Gawne, senior partner of Gawne
and Sons, builders, died a few days ago at
Reiby House, Newtown (Sydney), aged 68.
In that house died also, in 1855, the historic
Mrs. Mary Reibey, who was alleged to be
really luargaret Catchpole, but wasn’t. Mr.
Gawne had been helping to build Australia
for just half his life.
Private W. Slater, of France, newly
elected M.L.A. for Dundas (Vic.), is still
in the early twenties. He has always had to
push his own barrow. He was one of the
boys of the South Yarra Try Society ; next
he was a youngster in the office of D. E.
Brayshay, solicitor to the Licensed Victual-
lers’ Assoc. Later he got a job with a soli-
citor at Mildura, where he also took on
share-farming as a sideline. He left these
parts 18 months ago to heave a brick at
Wilhelm, and when he returns he is likely
to address a few remarks to those heroic
members of his party whose idea of warfare
is to bombard patriots with epithets and
rotten eggs.
“Coree” : Here’s my story of the long arm
and the hero’s name—well, let’s call him
O’Paris. He is a Frenchman, a descendant
of one of the Irish “Wild Geese” who fought
at Fontenoy and later marched all over
Europe with Napoleon. Having completed
his time as a conscript in France, he joined
up with his father in the Foreign Legion,
and both were discharged in time to lend a
hand against England in S’Africa. They
saw it through from start to finish, and at
one time fought alongside Colonel Arthur
Lynch, but mostly kept with the elusive De
Wet. Young O’Paris took part in a few
brushes with the Australians, and came to
the conclusion that Billjim was a good sort
and that Australia must be worth seeing: so
he struck out for here alone when the dust
had subsided. Coming straight to Banana-
land. he made for the North-West, got a job
at droving, and on joining the outfit found
that the foreman was a Billjim sergeant
whom he had picked up wounded and then
prisonered in South Africa.
An authenticated Australian love-story—
affidavits on application :
It begins on a small fattening and dairy farm in
Gippsland, with a girl in a washed-out print skirt
and a limp sunbonnet leaning on a red cow, a pail
at her feet and a promising boy at her elbow. These
two had drifted into a silent habit of holding hands
lately, and now the floodgates of his eloquence were
opened. He wanted Lucy to fly with him. Lucy
seemed willing but reluctant. She saw obstacles.
The recalcitrant parent or guardian is now due.
He has a hoe-handle rampant, and talks sudden
death. Argument is useless, and William Henry
(invariably Bill) goes over the fence, and finds his
horse just ahead of the cataclysm. Lucy confronts
the intruder. Mr. Joseph Wallen had come within
an ace of hitting Bill, and she wouldn’t stand it.
She reminded him that, after all, he was not her
father, and was exceeding his rights as guardian in
throwing hoe-handles at an eligible young surveyor
who loved her with all his heart and whom, she loved
the same. However, she would be of age in 17
months ; then she would marry Bill, so there ! Later
Bill heard of these remarks, and approved with reser-
vations. Seventeen months, he said, was eternity.
His job was shifting him on daily. Already the
run to see her was wearing his horse down to an
emaciated thing. Besides, his holidays were coming
due, and he had £5O, and nothing whatever stood in
the way of the most glorious honeymoon on earth but
her unwillingness to break away from an old miserly
curmudgeon who had made a drudge of her ever
since she was a kid. Lucy was impressed. If a
good escape were submitted she might—she just
might.
Here’s where the services of the large fair man
staying at Peebles’ Hotel were requisitioned. He
was a loud, boisterous man with a bull’s finesse in
doing things, but he and Bill were good friends, and
he had a motor-car. Would he lend his car for
an impending elopement ? Would he come to the
aid of young love, and further a romance ? Benton
thought it over for 10 seconds and said he would.
When he heard who the girl was he sat down and
stared for an hour. But, to his promise just, he
waited with his car just before sun-up on the third
day following, and whirled the young couple away,
with Joseph Wallen in hot but hopeless pursuit on
a grey mare of 18. Thqy found the expectant min-
ister in the far-away township. All preliminaries,
had been arranged, except the consent of the bride's
surviving parent, if any. Benton was not the man
to spoil a romantic drama for the lack of a father.
“Here,” he said, “I’ve seen this thing thus far, I’ll
see it through. T’ll give the girl away, and I’ll
give consent.” So Benton officiated as the sole
surviving parent, the marriage came off, and Benton’s
car caught the up train.
A week or so later Benton received a letter of
grateful thanks from the young couple, then located on
the Blue Mountains, N. S. Wales. At the same time,
Bill admonished Benton: “You look out for yourself,
old man. That was perjury you committed, and Wallen’s
a vindictive brute.” In due course the delirious pair
were in receipt of an answering communication. It
contained a draft for £2OO and said: “Go ahead,
have the best old honeymoon procurable. Never
mind Wallen and don’t fret about perjury. The fact
is my name’s Thomas Ogilvie, and I reckon nobody
had a better right to give the girl away. I’m her
father 1”
It was the simple fact. Benton had left his mother-
less daughter with Wallen. He had then charged
about the world in pursuit of fortune, had recently
overtaken it in a ship-salving venture, and had
returned to see to what extent Wallen deserved grati-
tude and reward in his character as foster-father.
The rest is bliss.
A good name went into the firing-line with
Sergeant R. Moresby Trehearne, now lieu-
tenant in a Vic. battalion. He is a nephew
of Admiral John Moresby, who discovered
and named New Guinea’s finest southern
harbor and 125 islands therewith.
“Melb”: The flag that flapped over the
Guild Hall last week in honor of Mannix
was described as the Irish National flag. I
never saw it before. Not the familiar green
field, with Erin’s golden harp ; the new ensign
is more like a slice off the sign of the Chinese
republic. It is a tricolor, with three oblong
bars running lengthwise. A short-sighted
person might fancy it the German flag of
the commercial navy, for which, before the
war, the Huns impudently adopted the Dutch
flag. However, the colors of the Irish
banner are different. It has purple on top,
then white, then green—that is, unless some
joker put it wrong side up at the Guild HaU.
“Messines”: There are some poor sports
amongst the officers in hospital in Australia.
A suburban car-owner, who doesn’t mind
burning petrol and wearing out tyres for
Billjim, frequently sends the chauffeur down
to a certain hospital to give lame and sick
soldiers a lift to and from the nearest tram ;
but very often ond or two able-bodied officers
will monopolise the loaned conveyance, while
the lame and maimed Billjims it is intended
for hobble painfully along with sticks and
crutches.
Sergeant C. C. Baldwin, killed at
Bapaume, was a grandson of poet Charles
Harpur, who used to have a public-service
billet on N. S. Wales South Coast 60 years
ago. Young Baldwin got a military medal
at Pozieres for “conspicuous bravery and
devotion to duty.” His portrait is to be put
alongside grandpa Harpur’s in the Mitchell
Library at Sydney.
“Teddy’’ Elburn, an ex-Australian, pion-
eered at Broken Hill, Zeehan-Dundas, West-
-1 ralia, Mt. Garnet-Chillagoe, and most other
places where grit distinguishes the best men.
When he left Australia it was for the Argen-
tine, and at Buenos Aires he taught the
natives how to dredge for gold, diamonds
and dollars. Next, he went to Lower Bur-
mah, tin-mining, and when civilisation got
its first black eye from Attila’s successor, he
enlisted, although over fighting age, and has
been doing transport work in France ever
since. His latest letter to a Melbourne chum
contains this delightfully-nai’ve sentence: —
As usual I have been into rows, and once got
seven days’ C.B. for laying out a Red Cross ambu-
lance driver for knocking me down with his car
He went to hospital in his own ambulance, anc
stayed there a week. Tremendous excitement al
through the bases, as the ambulance drivers had been
infernal nuisances for a long time. They are more
careful now. But it’s a dangerous thing to correci
a man in the King’s uniform.
Elburn winds up by saying he is going to
Canada, prospecting, after the war.

“O. McKhyham” : Thank Heaven I know
one optimist. I went down to have an argu-
ment with Ah Too Limp at the laundry
about some linen he had hashed up, und,
whilst waiting, asked him his opinion of
China’s entry to the war. He put down his
iron and expounded: “When China get
into war, it finish soon, you see.” “How s
that?” I asked. “Well, first week China
send one million men. They all get killed.
All li. Next week China send another mil-
lion men. They all get killed. All li! Next
week China send tlee million men. They all
get killed. All li! Then Germany have no
more ammunition left, and China win the
war. You see?” “I see! Gimme the shirts!’
“Centurion”: That yarn about the Ger-
man who was captured while stripping the
corpse of a brother Hun of trousers
makes me shiver reminiscently. Yehrs ago
while I was lying with a badly-shattered
thigh after an action in the Eastern Trans-
vaal, a relentless Boer took my breeks, boots
and other equipment in spite of the best bad
language I knew. It was a common thing
for stragglers to return to camp stark naked.
Plumer’s column had a very dignified R.E.
major for intelligence-officer (R.E. dignity
is the pukka stuff). He went away from the
column to a farm with a Kaffir escort. The
Kaffir did not return; the major did, later,
clothed only in blasphemy. Another Im-
perial officer, young and chubby, was cap-
tured while wearing the Queen’s Medal rib-
bon —a thing brother Boer resented, since
the war was still in progress. After re-
moving his breeks thev pinned the ribbon to
him—and he was ass enough to report the
outrage. His subsequent nickname —but, no
matter.

Badly as the Speck’s Parliament has
wanted praying for at times, it has rubbed
along without it till the other day, when
Tetley Grant, President of the Leg. Council,
put up a short petition before business
began. For longer than the Oldest Inhabi-
tant can remember, the Assembly lias
reckoned itself past praying for; but back in
the Dark Ages there used to be a prayer in
the Council. It got neglected, however, and
was formally dropped in 1880.
“O. Blin” : Uncle Sam has an indoor sys-
tem of teaching the unfledged airman. The
student is planted in a saddle near the roof.
Below him is a transparent map of the
Front, as it would appear to an airman
3000 ft. above. Underneath the map are
thousands of small electric-lights connected
with a keyboard, each light representing a
certain range in a certain direction
from an imaginary battery behind. The
lad above gives the aoproximate range as
he judges it to the teacher control-
ling the board, the corresponding button
is pressed, and the miniature flash re-
sembling a shell burst has the same value as
a ranging shot in actual warfare, enabling
him to correct his first calculation. Uncle
Sam is installing these spotting devices in
all his big aviation camps, which now num-
ber over 20.

It happened at a South Yarra open-air
meeting. The chief orator had provided a
rough seat for the use of pressmen just in
front of his impromptu platform, but none
of the reporters took advantage of the perch.
When the speaker had been heaving out
arguments and appeals for about 20 minutes,
an old fellow tottered across the open space
between rostrum and audience, and, sinking
on his knees at the form, buried his face on
his arms and sobbed aloud. The speaker
tried to ignore him, but presently the ancient
began throwing up his hands and uttering
wild cries. The orator was constrained to
pause. “This is rather disconcerting,” he
said. “Won’t somebody please remove the
man?” “Ah, go on, it’s all right,” said a
friend in front. “He gets saved at all the
Salvation Army meetings. He thinks you’re
an evangelist.” The old chap was at the
penitent form.
“Yannatherra”; Sun up, and our car
pushes into the Cairns end of the great fer-
tile valley stretching from here to Babinda.
I am off to see the white man making the
white sugar. Canefield adjoins eanefield
right out to the feet of the great ranges.
Lemons blossom on the roadside, and man-
goes are just turning to yellow. Our first
shock is to see the local school marm dis-
missing her scholars. Juvenile Japs, Chows,
Dagoes, Tannas and a lamentable minority
of white kids scurry away to the timber. A
mile or two further on the fields come right
on to the road and we get a close view of
the growers. A team of Japs load a tov
train of the cane country. Truck after truck
is kicked away looking as top heavy as a
popular clubman after a valedictory evening.
The little men are hustling like ants on a
dead lizard. Sweat pours out of them, dust
half smothers them, but they hardly stop to
observe us. On the opposite side of the
track a gang of whites. work at Dickson
award rates, pausing frequently to spit
and view Nippon fracturing all the rules of
the game. Lacking an interpreter, we soon
°et fed up and light out for Innisfail. We
pull into a small wayside store, post office
and general agency. The proprietor still
runs a small acreage of cane as a sideline.
My casual query as to whether we hadn’t
missed Australia sets him going. “White
Australia, my blanky oath ! Out goes Tanna
and in comes —well, strike me pink, you got
blanky eyes, ain’t you !” “Where are all the

old white hands?” I queried. “Here’s one
of the vermilion melons!” he answered,
smacking his chest. “All the other shrewd
blanlcers stayed just long enough to sell to
Dagoes on so much down and the balance
at 1000 per blanky cent.” “You still grow a
ratoon or two,” I said. “My blanky oath !”
he came back. “But the Dagoes cutting in
there now will have enough soon to pay my
figure. Next time you hop along here a
blanky Pong will be running this joint and
making a damn sight more out of it than I
am.”
VERY INCONSIDERATE OF DIM.
“I think Charlie is too mean for anything!

that the council was “trying to fi»h ? ared

the council really has no authority to decree
Ihe maximum amount of shapeliness to be
displayed. Skirt-censorship isn’t in
Bumble’s province. The police are the
authority ; and if the council isn’t satisfied
with what Law-’n’-order does, it ought to
close it's town hall and refuse to take the
price of impropriety. Talking only adver-
tises the fact that these old birds are out
hopping around among the girls, getting
shocked, when they ought to be sitting com-
fortably at home in the library among the
best authors. By the way, it was this same
St. Kilda Council which for years forebore
to build dressing-sheds on the long. cool,
pleasant local beaches, with the result that
breathless dippers had either to keep their
clothes on or change into bathing-togs in
the shelter of a sunshade or little Willie’s
sand bucket.
Crime is the only course open to the
Victorian girl who wants to get rid of vene-
real disease and cannot afford private hos-
pital treatment. Despite the brave talk of
Peacock and McLeod when at long last they
passed the Venereal Diseases Act, there is
not an institution other than the gaol hos-
pital in which’ a girl can be treated. Dr.
Robertson, chairman of the Board of Health,
said the other day that if he had a suitable
place for women suffering from syphilis and

where for treatment,” he told the Board.
The Board shook its head and remarked,
“Dear me, most regrettable!” or words to
that effect, and then (to quote the press
repont) “the matter was dropped.”

The Blogg scent experiments at South
Melbourne went up in smoke the other day.
along with many thouand pounds’ worth ot
essence-of-lemon, Epsom salts, salad oil, bag
blue and such household matters. The
Bloggs have been in the domestic-chemistry
business for many years, and before the
war started had dabbled a good deal in
various perfume-propositions without much
encouragement; but war conditions shoved
their manufactures ahead, so that some of
their rich Australian smells had begun to
get a hold on the market when the blaze
happened. But probably the interruption
won’t make much difference after a few weeks,
since the loss is mostly the insurance cos.
John, the senior Blogg. is well known as a
spare-time ehisellfr of Australian woods into
works of art, or thereabouts.
REINFORCEMENTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“There were lively scenes at North Melbourne. Mr.
D. Stephens said that some of those who were so
anxious about the voluntary system had volunteered
their services to the enemy. (Interruption.) If
the Kaiser were to come to Australia to-morrow
“A Voice: We would count him out. (Laughter.)”
Some strafe the Kaiser with their hands. They send
his minions West
By sticking cold, hard steel right through the Ger-
man neck or chest;
Some do their bit above the clouds or on the
heaving wave,
And in a hundred other ways men seek a martial
grave.
Why all these silly risks ? I ask. What’s all the
fuss about ?
The Stadium-boys are quite prepared to count the
Kaiser out.
The Hun had best keep off our tracks, for if the
blighter tries
To monkey with our liberties, a well-arranged sur-
prise
Awaits him in Australia —yes, his pride will have a
fall.
Should he commence to pin Australian babies to the
wall,
Like butterflies upon a card, swift judgment he will
meet —-
Our back-seat push will count him out, with yells
and stamping feet.
Our women hand the Kaiser out their share of nasty
knocks,
By daily tearing rags to bits or knitting piles of
socks ;
And some there are Who do their whack upon their
bended knees,
Scrubbing long* floors for mere Billjims come back
from overseas ;
But far the simplest way of all is just to raise a
shout,
And, with loud roars of laughter, count the blanky
Kaiser out.
POETRY AND PROSE.
"Oh, isn’t it lovely—everything so pure,
so spiritual, so free from the vileness of
the city! Put the basket down, George.
We’ll have lunch here.”
They call for help who fight for us on distant fields
to-day.
Ah, well, we’ll do our duty when the Kaiser comes
our way.
Aye, there are those who hold themselves forever in
reserve
Against the time when we may need brave lads of
genuine nerve,
Who, each of them uplifting here his voice and
hobnailed boots,
Will quell the Kaiser and his hosts in one great
storm of hoots.
The outlook is a gloomy one, the future far from
bright,
And many hearts are quickened with foreboding
and affright.
Perk up, chilled soul! The nation’s best prepares
itself to bawl
For you —a leathern-throated mob awaits its coun-
try’s call!
And, when the Kaiser’s transports come, they will
avert the rout —
A swarm of yowling die-hards, massed to count the
Kaiser out!

A CLASSICAL MASTER’S LETTER to CLEMENTS TONIC
Mr. G. A. Lundie, M.A., formerly Assistant-Headmaster High School, Palmerston North, N.Z, writes of this Medicine
And recommends it to all professional people, especi-
ally to teachers in the Educational service of Aus-
tralia, who suffer from weak nerves, insomnia or
brain fag.
“Palmerston North,
“New Zealand.
“CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.,
“I am an unsolicited witness to your remark-
able remedy.
“I suffered for years from a form of nervous
comnlaiut, which manifested itself in profound
melancholia which I could not throw off.

“My appetite was capricious to a degree, and
I developed ill-health, till life was a real burden.
“I was, furthermore, threatened with a com-
plete nervous breakdown. I could hardly fol-
low my duties as a high-school master, much
less give attention to serious teacher’s duties.
“I can honestly say your potent medicine
came to me as a revelation in healing, for I
regained my health completely through its con-
sistent use.
“For teachers engaged in mental strain and
arduous study, your tonic is indispensable as a
stand-by.
“I have recommended it to dozens of other
teachers, with most beneficial results.

“G. A. LTTNDIE, M.A.”
There are hundreds of teachers of both s6xes employed in
the N.S.W. Educational Service to-day who suffer from weak
nerves or acute nervousness, through continuous nerve strain in
teaching and study, who never really .enjoy good health. It is
as 'fhuch the worry of keeping their schools up to the educa-
tional standard as the work which accounts for their feeling of
general ill-health. They should keep Clements Tonic on hand
as a “stand-by” medicine, feeling certain that in its possession
they will have a sweet soother of the nerves, a promoter of
keen appetite, and a general healer of the rundown and over-
wrought system. It makes weak people well and strong people
stronger. Get it to-day.

A belated story of the Battle of the
Windmill of Messines—that mill which on
July 31 was taken, the first time, by a gang
of Billjims bereft of officers and sergeants,
and led by a corporal. After it was over a
youngster arrived at Divisional Headquar-
ters and made urgent demands for a car to
take him to the coast. The brass-hats
gathered and listened to the lad’s tale. He
was due for leave on the 30th, but had
begged his company commander to let him
stay for the stunt. So he saw it through,
and then rushed to headquarters in search
of transport for his Blighty leave. He got
the car.
Uncle Sam’s naval-communication ser-
vice has installed a radiophone fog warning
at Point Judith (U.S.A.) to enable vessels
to pick up the light in thick weather. The
apparatus is to operate in fog, mist, rain
and falling snow. It consists of a repetition
of the words, “Point Judith Light” every
five seconds, with a range of about eight
miles. After every third repetition the
warning “You are getting closer: keep off”
is sent out, with a limit range of about two
miles. Any ordinary wireless receiver will
take the signals. But the advice-notice to
shipping adds the caution that “although
measurements have been taken to determine
the limit of range of this apparatus, too
much reliance should not be placed on it
until its worth has been proved under service
conditions.”
“T. 0.1.”: Poor hysterical little Hughes’s

him, as Attorney-General of the Common-
wealth, to arrest a man, recalls an incident
that occurred in the Victorian Leg. Ass. in
the first ’sixties. J. D. Wood, then Minister
for Justice, referred indirectly to Dr. t. t.
Smith as a quack advertiser. Smith met
Wood in the refreshment-room and gave him

one on the point. He then bolted into the
Assembly Chamber, and R. D. Ireland fol-
lowed with a policeman (there was always
one on duty about the House). At the door
of the Chamber Ireland said, “Go in and
arrest him. I as Attorney-General give you
instruction.” John replied: “If you were
King of England I would not dare go in
there without the Speaker’s order.” and
Attorney-General Ireland admitted that the
policeman was right.

“Billy T.”: There was some
discussion in The Bulletin some
time back on the question how
most certainly to identify a bush-
bred person in the city. Most
of the important brands and ear-
marks were given, but I now sug-
gest that if you have any doubts
you must follow the suspect to
the National Library, Picture
Gallery or Museum, and closely
regard him there. If he is a
true Bill Busliie he will behave in
these public institutions much as
if he were a conscience-stricken
intruder with diabolical inten-
tions, expecting every minute to be
discovered, seized and handed over
to the boiling-down department.
I watched a couple walk through
Melbourne Public Library the
other afternoon. Their ner-
vousness approached consterna-
tion. They walked noiselessly,
with a pained reverence that
would not be out of place in a
visitor to the sepulchre of Holy
Moses, and when an attendant
approached them you realised
that their hour had come. The
attendant sought to swat a fly
merely, but the visitors from
Teddywaddy had run risks enough
for one day. They pussy-catted
out. I followed. There was a
third outside, a whiskered mis-
creant who had not dared to enter
at all. The male escapee had his
hat off, and was mopping a very
bald head, oozing drops of trepi-
dation. “Go on, Hick,” he was
saying to his friend, with a false assumption
of valor, “you orter go in. They treat you
very well in there!”
The Adelaide Coroner has had the deli-
cate task of deciding whether a man lately
dead was a suicide or a—a —a perverter of
the truth. The man was in obvious pain,
and to his wife’s solicitous inquiry replied
briefly “Poison” —and died. But there was
no poison in the house, and. the doctor says,
none in the body. So the Coroner remarked
benevolentlv that a man might suffer from
delusions, and officially recorded it as a
case of natural causes.
“F.A.Q.” : Lodge-doctors in Victoria, who
are now battling for a rise all round, com-
plain bitterly that they are being “imposed
upon” by a percentage of their patients. All
right; but the general public has also a well-
recognised grievance in the fact that a citi-
zen who doesn’t belong to a lodge can’t
appeal against a medical man’s overcharge
except to a court of law, with its expense
and publicity. I was bitten for two guineas
some time ago by a suburban practitioner
who rode a push-bike a few blocks,
pricked a gumboil for the patient —
call it a dental abscess, if you like —
wrote a simple prescription and
pushed off, never .to be seen again.
This was “an operation.”
Sawbones needlessly added
insult to injury, when the
size of the fee was pro-
tested against, by stating
in his reply that he had
made his charge “speci-
ally low,” though there
was no apparent reason
why he should have been
so obliging. The doctor-
secretary of a medical
society, questioned un-
officially about the matter,
declared that it wasn’t
a fair thing, and advised
bringing the matter be-
fore a certain associa-
tion. Since that time, on
numerous occasions, this
writer has had at his
house a highly-degreed
doctor, travelling by
motor-car and perform-
ing much more important
work than gumboil-reduc-
tion. at a cost of 10s. Gd.
a visit. The medical
association to which de-
ponent finally stated his case, after the
full two guineas had been paid under
a threat of immediate police-court pro-
ceedings, didn’t even have the courtesy
to acknowledge the letter sent. Of
course, no such experience can befall the
fully-protected lodge-patient, who can get all
the gumboil-relief he wants for 31d. a week.
It seems an ill-balanced state of affairs.
From Petrograd, just before the storm: —
Recent researches have disclosed the devilish sen-
suality of the monk Rasputin, who helped to pull
the throne down. He corrupted many virtuous
women by cunning appeals to their religious sense.
The monster took as a text the joy there is in Para-
dise over the one sinner that repenteth, and inter-
preted it to mean that one must proceed through
sin to the purest heavenly bliss. This misreading
of the Scriptures appealed to mystical women accus-
tomed to regard perfection as the fruit of sacrifice.
Two or three notables have been named as his
victims, and even the ex-C'zarina’s name has not been
out of the mouths of the whisperers, though she is
generally credited with having ignored the sensual
side of Rasputin’s character. She is a genuine
religious enthusiast who found no impropriety in
receiving the impostor’s alleged spiritual guidance
in her bedroom. One morning a shocked maid-of-
honor found the monk blessing the Czarina in her
most attractive neglige. The virtuous young person
informed Nicholas, who promptly reproved her for
interrupting her mistress in her study of the “sacred
mysteries.” Rasputin was introduced to the Czarina
by her sister, who had encountered him in a convent
in Moscow when he was making a pilgrimage to
Jerusalem. The royal lady was deeply struck by
the religious fervor of a pilgrim who was doing the
journey on foot, begging his food from door to door.
Probably if “Mrs. Romanoff” had known the true
reason for the journey she would have been severely
shaken. The greasy ruffian was doing penance for
rape in his native Siberian town of Tinmen. Actu-
ally he had been publicly kicked out of the. village,
where he long had a reputation as an accomplished
horse-thief.
“899” : I can hit the unwinking bull's-eye
on the range, blit for quick work in the field
I give way to the ’roo-shooter. After tlie
Landing I found myself next to a 8. Aus.
boy who is now a Military Medallist. We
were in a good position overlooking a clear-
ing in the scrub through which a number of
Allah’s chosen were crawling preparatory
massing for an attack. The South Australia .<
had his rifle ready trained on the open patch,
and nearly every Abdul that started to' rush
across was dropped. I tried time after time,
but was always too slow on the trigger.
Every time my mate got his man he laughed
and said “Another kangaroo!”
“P.X.”: It is rather late- to think of it
now, but it might have been worth a few
thousand men and a few tens of millions of
money to us if at the end of the first three
months of the war we had either shot all the
Censors and noisy flag-waggers or interned
.them, and, instead of fining or firing-in
every German who said we were silly, stupid
Pritishers, had paid them handsomely to tell
us why they thought so. Next time—if there
is a next time —we shall probably do the same
as we did this time; but if we have learned
anything from experience it will be, not to
close the mouth of the enemy in our midst,
but to encourage him to open it. The
mouth that needs closing is that of the fool

who tells us we are winning, and of course
must win, because we are British, while the
other party must lose because he is some-
thing else. Even to this moment there is a
War Precautions law which prescribes boil-
ing oii or something of the sort for “causing
public alarm,” though that was the very
thing that Britain and Australia were most
in need of three years ago, and have been in
need of ever since.

Died last week, at 44. Stewart Wilson,
chief officer of the Meteorological Depart-
ment in N. S. Wales —the man whose name
has been stamped on the weather forecasts
issued in Sydney for nine years past. Since
he was about 16 Wilson had lived on isobars
and pressure areas, and barometers and
gauges and records were his hobby and his
only playthings.. He entered the service in
the days when H. C. Russell ruled over stars
as well as clouds, and, when the depart-
ments were separated and he became local
chief of the meteorological branch, if he
didn’t provide the weather that everybody
wanted it wasn't because he didn’t want to
oblige everybody. He was a brother-in-law
of James Edmond.

Edward Fanning, of much commercial
note in Melbourne, has passed out. in his
70th year. He was schooled at Eton and
Oxford, where he was prominent in athletics,
being a first-class long jumper and cricketer.
He narrowly missed his cricket blue at
Oxford. On coming to Australia he joined
the firm of Fanning, Nankivell and Co.,
merchants, of which his father was senior
partner; and as time went on he got heavy
interests in banks, breweries, coal and other
cos. In his young days he played with
M. and represented Victoria against
N. S. Wales in 1883, and he was also well-
known as a follower of the Melbourne
hounds. His widow is a daughter of David
Moore, Sydney native and Melbourne mer-
chant, who was one of four representatives
of Melbourne in the first Victorian Parlia-
ment of 1556.
Miss Tomkinson and Miss Hornabrook,
daughters of respected old citizens of the
last century, have had their annual shot at
getting on to the Adelaide City Council,jand
polled better than ever before. Some day
they will get there; and very useful aider-
women they may make.
The election of the railway-packer baronet
James Stephen Goold as an alderman for
the little South Aus. town of Gladstone, re-
calls the public discovery 10 years_ ago that
lie was an Irish baronet of an ancient Cork
family who had been working on the S. Aus-
tralian railways for many years. “Sir
Stephen” has such an objection to distinc-
tion that he would have liked his rank to
have never been revealed.

“D.”: Dr. Samuel Thornton, just gone to
his reward, was, I think, disconcerted only
once in the whole course of his episcopal
career, and that happened when the highly
decorous horse that drew his neat brougham
fell dead under the influence of an intoler-
able sun ' near a then-prosperous mine in
Ballarat East: In the absence of Samuel’s
factotum, who had gone for assistance, two
miners went to the bishop’s succor, with an
offer of a horse. The horse was brought.
He was probably the most ungainly quadru-
ped that ever bobbed the bald remnant of a
tail. He looked like first-cousin to a
camel on the mother’s side, though
more closely related to a giraffe on the
side of his sire. Add the effects of
age, starvation and decrepitude, and
you begin to see that horse. _I h\
Thornton protested, but the miners
insisted. They harnessed their neddy
in, and then gave their best attention
to the task of keeping hihi up and
moving. Their hope was that they
might convey the Bishop the lull
length of Bridge and Sturt streets in
this way ; but ere they had gone half
a mile one looked back to discover the
brougham empty. Dr. Samuel had climbed
out over the back, and softly stolen away.
Inspector Anderson, just retired from Ma’s
police force, and appointed chief ot Billy
Hughes’s bodyguard, claims a record—he never
once drew his baton in 3S years service,
but was always able to persuade _ em to
“come quietiv.” He spent most of lus years
in Wagga, Bathurst and Wollongong, and
retires without one mark on his sheet, and
if that has been equalled it hasn’t been
beaten, anyhow.
Dunedin (jYI.L.) has said the Long laie-
well to its most prized citizen, Mrs. A. R.
Livingstone. She was the third daughtei of
Dr. Thomas Burns, the Aaron of the Otago
settlement, and a grandniece of the one and
only Bobbie Burns whom all Scawtchmen
worship. So in a land o’ whusky and haggis
like Dunedin the just-deceaSed lady was sure
to be regarded as something akin to a high
priestess. She was born. in Ayrshire, and
landed in Dunedin as a child with her father
away back in 1848, and had been in the
Seawtch city ever since. In 1862 she mar-
ried A. It. Djvingstone, a well- known book-
seller, who died a few years back.
An ancient overlander who knew the real
Australia passed out the other day at_l’arra-
matta. Duncan Campbell was born 87 years
ago in Argyllshire, but came this way as an
eight-year-old. Before he was into his 20’s
he went droving, and stuck to it for close
on half a century. lie was one of the first
to steer the overlanding mobs between the
Gulf country and Victoria. The political
game was a stirring business in Parramatta
years ago, and in between his droving trips
Campbell took a hand in it. But he never
found time to get married.
Killed in Palestine, Chaplain-Captain W.
J. Dunbar. A native of Orange (N.S.W.),
he began preaching at Coonamble in 1008
and was at Tilba Tilba when he
enlisted in the Light Horse in 1915.
Ile sailed as sergeant and tempo-
rary chaplain, but having arrived
in Egypt got back to the ranks
again, and served there till they
made him chaplain once more —that
was nine months ago. Twice, how-
ever, he managed to go with his
cobbers into action, only to be
spotted and ordered to the rear.
“They make no provision for pri-
vate enterprise in these parts,” he
wrote home. During the recent
operations Abdul managed to drop the good
fellow.
Senior-sergeant Kenny, Hughes’s War-
wick ((>.) friend, used to lie a detective in
Brisbane and Rockhampton, and was only
lately transferred from Cairns to Warwick,
after having caused quite a sensation by
refusing to prosecute a certain Oriental
before a local 'magistrate whom he accused
of having received a present from the
defendant.
Frederick William Arthur Downes, ex-
M.L.A. of Camden (N.S.W.), is out at 62.
Brownlow Hill, where he died, came into
note a hundred years ago when the Govern-
ment herd of cattle was kept there. A little
later it became the property of George
Macleay, son of the old-time Imperial
Colonial Secretary. George Macleay was at
Brownlow Hill in the twenties and thirties
of last century, and the late Mr. Downes's
father was his manager. The Macl'eays were
noted botanists, and graced the grounds
with plants procured from all parts of the
world. But that sort of thing did not appeal
much to the Downes family, who went in
more for hog-raising.
Walter Henty, who had been in the grass-
growing business at The Caves, Hamilton,
for many years, died last month at 61. He
was a son of the late Stephen Henty, who
arrived at Portland Bay in 1837, about two
years and a half after his brother, the pion-
eering Edward, and went into the whaling
industry with him. They rounded up five
dozen whales during the first season. Lieut.
Edward Henty. of the Light Horse, who was
killed in Gallipoli during the historic bap-
tism of that willing outfit, was a son of
Walter.
ARCHDEACON HINDLEY,

“Aunt Dorcas” (Mrs. Thomas Buffett),
who died a few days ago at Norfolk Island,
was one of the descendants of the mutineers
of the Bounty who were removed from lit-
cairn island in 1856. There are only two
or three of them left: Aunt Dorcas was the
oldest of the women.
There was a Gyles who fought at Trafal-
gar. His son. the late S. W. Gyles, was
with La lor at Eureka. His grandson, N. L.
Gyles, of Moonee Ponds (Yici). has just
enlisted in Melbourne. He is 40, but hopes
to join the Flying Corps.

From Tiie Bulletin's private curate: —
Noel Stretch, whose father Pishes under Anglican
rules at Newcastle (N.S.W.), has been given a bar
to his Military Cross. Another bishop’s son named
Noel—Captain Noel Chavasse —whose dad has the
Gaiters of Liverpool (Eng.), won the V.C. early, and
last September a. bar to it was gazetted—a record
for the war. But the honor was posthumous. Dr.
Chavasse, by the way, was nearly coming to bish in
Sydney 27 years ago. When the see was vacant in
1890, local Anglicans made a preliminary selection
of three names—Chavasse, Dr. Moule (now at Dur-
ham) and Saumarez Smith. All were Low Church,
naturally, as that is the prevailing color of Sydney
Anglicanism; but as Chavasse was supposed to be
less Low than the others, the few High Church
members of Synod gave him their support. That
settled his chances, and eventually Saumarez Smith,
the least distinguished of the three, was chosen.
P. B. MacGregor, senior counsel for the
Federal authorities in the recent hopeless
prosecution of Queensland Premier Ryan
for making false statements, is the selected
Liberal (State) candidate for Merthyr, and

Gone aloft, .7. A. Jamieson, master-
mariner and pilot in the N. 8. Wales coastal
service for nearly 30 years, lie had varied
experiences in Australian and Maoriland

others had failed, of the material for the
construction of the lighthouse on the storm-
swept islet known as the South Solitary,

when he undertook similar work at the
almost inaccessible Seal Rocks (N.S.W.).
Hugh Paterson was buried in Melbourne
last week. A guid Scot and a tine artist, ho
was the youngest of four brothers who had
all been born with paintbrushes in their
little fists. The foremost of the quartette,
the late John Ford Paterson, was one of the
most delicately suggestive landscapists we
have ever had in Australia, but Hugh was
almost as gifted, and shone strongly, if more
obscurely, as a decorative artist. His two
musical daughters, Esther and Betty, have
much of their father's talent and possess a
neat fancy in black and white, Hugh Pater-
son was (51, and hailed from a part of {Scot-
land that had raised our Governor-General.
Andrew Fisher, a warm friend of both,
worked as a braw lauttie somewhere in the
same region.
Died in Melbourne. Captain St. John
George, one of the few men who could , find
his way through Torres Strait by night.
For many years he was commander of the
E. and A. passenger boats trading between
Australian and Chinese ports, his last ship
being the Empire. He was over 30 . V< ‘ : V' S
in this trade before he retired a little while
back.
The Vic. Labor party in the Assembly
now has two members at or approaching the
Front. Gordon Webber, last month re-
turned unopposed for Abbotsford, lately left
for Europe; and Private Slater, who has
just taken Dundas from Kennedy Smith, is
also on service. Major Baird is the onl>
member of the other side who has been at
the Front.
THE WAR BABY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Did you grow in a cabbage, little pink boy?
Break from a chou, as the Belgians do ?
Sure, you’d be strong and splendid then ;
For the Belgian soldats, they are men!
Did you peer the portals of Heaven through
And slip on a cloud by the gates of Blue l
Did you spring from a rose, my little pink boy?
A rose of grace in a garden place?
An English rose, with a thorn perchance:
Oh, many a thorn do they thrust in France
To bar the way of the hungry Hun !
Did you spring from a rose, my dimpled one?
Were you found in the folds of a waratah
In the mountain vales up in New South Wales?
Was it Queensland wattle that made for you
The first little gown that your arms slid through?
Did you hide low down in a Maori fern,
Or where Tasmania’s poppies burn
Did you snatch at your life-flame, little pink boy?
On Yarra banks, in the rushy ranks',
Did you look o’er the rim of a lily’s snow?
What matter this so a man you grow,
To shoulder arms in the same brave way
That your soldier daddy has done to-day !

The cry of the Anti is that voluntary
enlistment has done well enough and that
there is no need to change the system. Let
us get down to the figures as at October 31:
Total enlisted .. .. .. .. 383,000
Struck off for various reasons after
enlistment.. .. .. .. 67,857
In training in Australia .. .. 16,707
84,564
Sent from Australia .. .. .. 298,436
Dead 34,731
Missing .. .. .. .. 4,502
Returned to Australia .. .. 42,988
82,221
Australian army overseas . . . . 216,215
In Egypt and Palestine .. .. 17,270
En route home or awaiting passage 17,016
En route to England and Egypt .. 5,745
In England .. .. .. .. 71,809
111,840
Available for five divisions .. .. 104,375
A division should consist of about 24,000 men.
As a matter of fact, it has got down to under
21,000; and that no doubt explains why
Birdwood lately sent one division back
behind the lines and reinforced the other
four.
There were still 71,809 men in England.
Who are they? Exact figures are not avail-
able ; but on the best information procurable
they can be cut up this way:—
Wounded and sick .. .. .. .. 25,000
Resting (furlough) .. . . .. .. 20,000
Available when trained for reinforcements .. 26,809
Total.. .. .. .. .. 71,809
When the 20,000 on furlough return another
20,000 will of course be due for a spell.
Similarly when the 25,000 wounded and sick
return to the trenches, it is too much to hope
that there won’t be 25,000 others to take
their beds and their crutches.
The total number in excess of men in the
field and the casualties and men resting is
thus-: —•
In England and available when trained . . 26,809
In camp in Australia .. .. .. 16,707
En route .. .. .. .• •5,745
Total 49,261
But from this number must be deducted, in
order to arrive at the number available to
maintain the five divisions in France, say
7000 necessary to bring the divisions up to
full strength and a certain number necessary
to reinforce the Light Horse, Camel and
other corps in Egypt—say, 5000. A consider-
able number of the men despatched of late
have not gone to France. That leaves (say)
37,000 men, equal to 5i months’ reinforce-
ments. This was the position at the end of
October. Since then, the enlistments have
been insufficient to repair the wastage; so
that at the present time it is doubtful
whether there are enough men in khaki to
keep the divisions up to full strength for five
months —and a large proportion of these are
untrained. In the circumstances the talk of
a sixth division sounds more like ghastly
satire than anything else. Even using only
partially-trained men we cannot see five
divisions beyond March or April.

That doesn’t show any deep war scar. Ought
a bank to show war scars? Is the condition
of things healthy when it is possible for a
great bank to show profits practically as
great after more than three years of war as
it could before the calamity happened? To
get down to bedrock, is the world as well
off to-day as it was four years ago? Mil-
lions upon millions of property has been
destroyed on sea and land; millions upon
millions of men have been kept unproduc-
tive for over three years; thousands of mil-
lions have been put into “tanks” and pip-
squeaks and dug-outs and bombs and pill-
boxes from which there can be no harvest
but death and disablement that will mean
a grievous burden of non-producers in the
future. It can hardly be seriously sug-
gested. then, that the world is anything like
so well off as it was four years ago. Yet
there is scarcely a man who has less money
than he had four years ago. Most people
have a good deal more. If they haven’t more
capital their earnings are greater. How,
then, can this anomaly be explained? By
the simple fact that we have been printing
millions of bank-notes and lOU’s aRd other
promises to pay. There has been appalling
destruction of property, which is wealth;
but there has been unexampled creation of
paper money and credit; and on that the
’Asia and other banks have prospered.
Well, what does that mean in the future?
Apparently this, among other things. We
shall work for 10 years and create wealth
enough to repay (say) 25 millions of debt.
We shall then be apparently no better off
than we are to-day, because as the debt is
paid the paper will be destroyed. Look at
these figures:—
April, ’l4. April, T 6. April,’l7.

Thus the public has £23,963,868 in the ’Asia
mm, as against £22,501,578 just before the
war started —an increase roughly of a mil-
lion and a half; and there are many banks
which show much larger figures. The point
is that the figures are not likely to grow at
all rapidly for a good many years to come —
that the increase in the paper wealth of the
past three years discounts the growth of
more solid wealth for some years ahead.
Which means that banks are probably not
going to be in a position to make much more
gross profits for some years to come than
they are making to-day.
If you increase your capital by borrowing,
you can only bring your own capital up to
the full amount of the borrowed money by
gradually using realised profit to pay off
loan. Meantime, of course, there is in-
terest to pay on the borrowed money. Now
this is the position that banks find them-
selves in. There are millions upon millions
of extra paper-wealth from which they can
extract profit; but out of the extra profit
they must pay their whack of the interest
and the sinking fund. This call upon cos. to
pay up has been much more insistent in
England than in Australia, where the finan-
cial policy of the Commonwealth Govern-
ment has consisted of fumbling along.
Hughes apparently knows nothing whatever
of this subject: and poor old John Forrest’s
friends ought to persuade him that he is
marring a fine record by holding on to an
office whose demands now far exceed his
powers. How palsied has been the hand of
the Australian tax-gatherer by comparison
with the British you may judge by this com-
parison of this bank’s taxes: —
April, T 4. April, ’l7.
Australasian .. £15,588 £37,697
London.. .. 16,219 60,038
The Australasian taxes include those of
Maoriland. Commonwealth taxation alone
has probably increased less than 75 p.c.;
whereas the English taxation has increased
by 375 p.c. Britain is grasping the nettle.
Australia is enjoying the good times so
thoroughly that its wretched Government is
afraid to disturb it by taxation that really
means anything. Later on, however, people
who will talk less and do more will have to
take hold ; and then much larger lumps will
have to be taken out of bank and other pro-
fits. This is inevitable.

Like most other banks this one doesn’t show
very much of the wear-and-tear of war. Yet
of all the States Westralia has the fewest
financial compensations. For, of course,
there are compensations. The Eastern States
wouldn’t be feeling so perky if the Allies
hadn’t been paying them abnormal prices for
their wool, meat, copper and other things.
Westralia is a sheep-grower, too, but, in
spite of its great area, its wool exports are
barely l-25th of the Australian total. Its
great industry, gold-mining, has, on the other
hand, actually suffered from the war; for
while the price of the product is fixed, costs
have steadily increased. Further, owing to
the backwardness of manufacturing industry
in the West, that State has pouched little of
the money spent on the equipment of the
Australian army. A little compensation has
come from the heavy expenditure on the
East-West railway. But, generally speaking,
Westralia has had a very small share in
either the real or the fictitious prosperity
which has been an unexpected feature of the
Eastern States’ history during the first three
years of war. Hence there has been little
inflation of this bank's balance-sheet figures:

The public’s money in the business totals
now £2,554,455 as against £2,593,284 on Sep-
tember 30, 1914—a very different story from
that told by most Australian banks. It has,
therefore, not been possible for this bank to
make any large investment in War Loans;
its holding of public securities (apart from
Australian notes) is now £126,755 ; at Sep-
tember, 1914, it was £124,585.
On the figures there is no visible reason
why profits should have fallen from the pre-
war standard. Indeed, since rates for ad-
vances have improved, and since so large a
proportion of the money in the business is
the bank’s own, one might have expected
gross profits to have been larger. Evidently,
however, general depression has had its effect
on exchanges and other earnings; and pro-
bably the management also sees the wisdom
of increasing its inner reserves. At any
rate, disclosed gross profits, after providing
for contingencies, have shrunk from £71,159
as at September, 1914, to £66,669 in the
past term. This paper would be glad to
believe that the early future would be
brighter, but it can see no grounds for that
optimism. On all the evidence available,
Westralia has a hard, dry time ahead of it.
In ordinary circumstances this bank’s divi-
dend ought to have been already reduced;
but there is some justification for keeping it
where it is for the present in the fact that
funds (capital and reserves) amount to
£966,086. Many other banks have the cus-
tody and risk of seven times more of the
public’s money than their own. This bank
lias less than three times more, which means
that the depositors are exceptionally well
secured. Liquid assets represent all but
£1.530.474 of the bank’s debt to the public;
and against that it has other assets valued
at £2,496,560. If shareholders could be as
sure of their present dividend as deposi-
tors are of their money they would be
very fortunate people. That dividend, by
the way, nominally 20 p.c., really means
only 7 p.c. or 8 p.c. on the bulk of the capi-
tal, which has been issued at a heavy pre-
mium.

The contingency account has been strength-
ened during the half-year by £622. Taking
everything into account the results for the
term are so good that the shareholders
should reckon themselves very fortunate
people. Nothing but exceptionally good
management could have done it. Printing
paper, the second-largest item in news™™,
costs—labor probably stands first—ha«
vanced approximately fourfold since fh
war started; or adding freight, insurance 6
and exchange, about fivefold. It doesn’t f
course, follow that this co. has thus far n fl ?a
quite those increases. A subsequent com
parison shows how heavily stocks have heen
drawn upon during the past term; and tho
co must apparently now buy for current
requirements at current rates. But even
during the past year, average gross prices
have been, say, three times more than the
normal.
“Higher costs,” the directors sav “have
been to a great extent counterbalanced bv
very substantial increases in the business
done A continuance of this cannot be
expected.” This seems highly probable. As
soon as the Conscription campaign is out Vf
the way, the question of finance will have
to be faced. Hitherto we have continued
to lean more or less on Britain, and the
time has come when we simply must finance
our own share in the war. This is going to
mean a campaign for economy and tighten-
ing the purse-strings. The abominable Cen-
sorship with which we started ueliberatelv
aimed at the suppression of public alarm
We were winning all the time—so whv
trouble about the future? We were not
winning. When the public generally realises
that we may lose, the conditions "of trade
are likely to suffer a great change. Simul-
taneously, so far as this co. is concerned,
costs are likely to rise still higher. “Fur-
ther advances in the price of paper and in
freight are probable,” the directors say
“The newspaper world in Australia will
without doubt be confronted in the immedi-
ate future with serious difficulties.” Mean-
time Herald shareholders will draw comfort
from the fact that, whereas last half-year's
reduced net profit was £20.062, the present
dividends call for only £13,750.
The co., moreover, is admirably placed to
meet a time of stress: —

In the first half of that 10-year period the
co. was able to put over £20.000 into free-
holds besides adding a bit to stock and piling
up £38,000 of liquid assets. The past five
years have seen only £ll,OOO added to the
freehold and £ll,OOO to the liquid assets.
The balance of undivided profit has gone
into plant, necessary for carrying on the
business free from opposition. The increase of
liquid assets in the earlier period was, there-
fore, deceptive ; money was piling up against
an inevitable outlay ahead. On the other
hand the equipment seems now to be quite
adequate to hold the field, without any fur-
ther large outlay for a good many years to
come, especially as there won’t be much
money available for speculative enterprises
like the establishment of a rival newspaper.

For a manufacturing co. this one is in an
extraordinary position. It has over one-half
of its capital liquid—in Commonwealth War
Loan and cash. Twelve months ago it had
only £3767 thus represented; now it has
£15,320. Meantime its total liabilities have
advanced only from £630 to £1719. The
change has been due chiefly to a reduction of
stock-in-trade from £20.962 to £13,370, while
book debts have been pulled down from
£3432 to £1370. The w r ar is, of course, at
the back of it. Apart from the direct trade
which it has brought to hat
it has secured for them the bulk of the
ordinary trade ; and though prices have been
regulated so that hats are no dearer than
they were before the war, raw material has
been regulated too, with the result that
this co. has made a comfortable 10 p.c., while
employing little more than half of its capital
in the business. But throw the market open
and things will be very different once more.
Larger stocks will have to be carried: and.
though book debts are never heavy, because
the dealings are mostly with a few big whole-
salers, they can’t well be kept down to
£1370. In one respect the co. is better placed
than many manufacturers. Hat-making
plant is not extensive, and there is not
much capital locked up in that item, de-
manding heavy depreciation for wear and
tear and obsolescence. But that isn’t all to

the good, for what machinery doesn’t do the
hand has to, and that means labor troubles.
On the whole, however, this trade has had
less to complain of than most, (1) because
of the average higher quality of the oper-
atives, and (2) because the hat trade has
always been pretty well protected. As re-
marked here once before, it hasn’t been a
bad thing for the industry that the Minister
for Customs in four out of the five Labor
Ministries was a felt-hatter before he was a
Parliamentarian.
Broken Hill Junction, the poor relation
among the B. H. cos., suffered with the others
from the strike, which laid the mine idle for
two months during the half-year to the end
of September. Nevertheless, after writing off
£2lOO against plant depreciation, the co.
made a profit of £4422. The depreciation
was very nearly equal to the expenditure on
replacements and additions. Liquid assets
on September 30, apart from stores, were
£8520 and liabilities (including provision for
income-tax) £2007; and as the co. has a
satisfactory ore-selling contract with the Sul-
phide Corporation running to May, 1018,
there may be a dividend before the current
half-year is out. Last half the mine sup-
plied 16,491 tons of sulphides and 537 tons
carbonates to its ore-buyers, and it is now
turning out 1000 tons a week. As in the case
of its neighbor, Block 14, the co. can’t tell
what ore is in the mine; but no doubt there is
enough to keep it pottering about for several
years. Most of the stuff will be costly to
get: last half-year’s mining and delivery
exes, were about 275. per ton. But it is
pretty good stuff; the sulphides averaged
9.30 z. silver and 12.6 n.c. lead, and the car-
bonates 6oz. silver and 19 p.c. lead. There
are 72,567 10s. fully-paid shares in the co.
and 200,000 contribs. paid to 6s. sd.

Mount David (N.S.W.) in its reincarna-
tion is to be the Mount Dudley with a
modest capital of £15,000 in 120,000 shares
of 2s. 6d. each: the holder of a share in
Mount David will be entitled to a share in
Mount Dudley on payment of 2d., and the
share will then be deemed to be paid to Is.
The new mine at Trunkey, about 30 miles
away, will be equipped with the excellent 20-
head mill, etc., now on Mount David. So
far, from development work, 452 tons have
given the mine’s present farmer-owner
£3183. The reef has been proved to 145 ft.,
and runs from 2ft. to sft. The price to. be
paid is easy—£lsoo by three monthly in-
stalments and £3500 from one-quarter of the
gold won. W. 11. Martin, the manager of
Mount David, reckons there are 2500 tons
in sieht worth l|oz., with the ore solid
underfoot at 145 ft.
At 1760 ft. South German, Maldon (Vic.),
has pushed through the big break on to the
reef, and the quartz which fills the whole
drive is said to go lOdwt. The market,
however, hasn’t become excited, for the
reason that Maldon estimates don’t live long
when sent to the mill. A small crushing of
380 tons averaging about lOdwt. has been
put through, and the talk is that in an east
crosscut and in the drive south 7dwt. stone
is making. But there are no profits, so
there seems to be a flaw somewhere.

South Australian Oil Wells. Co.’s half-
yearly report, just issued, details the work
of dismantling the pioneer borehole for oil
in Australia. Work stopped at 4540 feet
because the technical staff decided they had
struck a “dry hole” —one in which the geo-
logical indications were favorable for the
existence of petroleum, although the oil had
migrated elsewhere. The co. has decided
to put down its second bore at Tantanoola,
a township between Mount Gambier and Mil-
licent. It is proposed to use the present
tools, casing and derrick to bore to 2000 ft.
The locality is hilly and the ranges contain
a series of anticlines in sandstone and lime-
stone country which everywhere else usually
contain oil. The No. 1 well cost £11,123,
plus £1769 for buildings and water well. etc.
This represents £2 16s. 9d. per foot drilled
not extravagant for a prospecting well in a
remote region. But overhead and office ex-
penses at £B24B—all spent in 3J years*—
seem far too heavy for an oil well co. During
the last half-year office expenses were £847
for controlling £lO9B of field expenditure.
This is reminiscent of the old. Broken Hill
boom days, when Australian directors were
learning silver-lead mining at the expense of
shareholders.

The most important statement coming
from Chairman Piggott at Mt. Cuthberts
meeting was that the new contract for the
sale of copper hasn’t been signed. Piggott
sounds a warning about recent increases in
wages. The cost of producing blister at the
smelter is £BO per ton. On top of that
there are office exes., debenture interest,
railway and shipping freight, etc. It is
quite evident that the cost of laying down
refined copper at an Australian port will
have to be radically reduced if the industry
is to live in ordinary times.
There are some lonely little patches of tin
still about Herberton (Q.). Last month
Thompson, of the Extenuate, put through
12 tons for concentrates sold for £5lO = £42
10s. per ton.

From the old Dee copper-mines 100 tons
of ore has been sent to Mount Morgan for
treatment. It is just 50 years since the
last ore was raised, the mine having been
closed down in November, 1877.
► * * *
Hampden Cloncurry (Q.) will lengthen its
life if it can make a success of concentra-
tion, for there are thousands of tons in all
its mines that are too low-grade to stand
present high transport and smelting charges.
Very large quantities have been proved at
Pindora, and it is intended to test 1000
tons at the concentrator.

Ukalunda Minerals is a co. formed to
reopen an old bismuth show 120 miles from
Bowen (Q.). The mine produced 1000 tons
of bismuth ore 25 or 30 years ago, when
Dr. Flatau was attracted to the spot.
Cartage to Bowen was reasonable consider-
ing the rivers, the black soil and the
stretches of heavy sand, but the high treat-
ment costs and the ridiculous deductions,
nominally to cover losses, finally proved too
much of a handicap. It is said that costs
totalled £46 per ton, which was prohibitive
on 18 p.c. bismuth. (The assay might be
25 p.c. in Queensland, but payment was
made for only 18 p.c. in London.) Uka-
lunda Minerals has fallen into the hands
of experienced mining men, who will give
the bismuth and silver-lead lodes of the dis-
trict a thorough trial.
Coronet Hill (N.T.), on a costs sheet of
over £l3 per ton, sent tons to Cockle
Creek (N.S.W.), and netted £3268, the ore
having averaged 21 p.c. copper and 20oz.
silver per ton. But no mine could stand
charges like that if John Bull wasn’t pay-
ing big spot-cash prices for the metal. The
co. has a little lot of 90 tons of ore of about
the same grade on its way to Kembla, as
well as 1200 tons of 12 p.c. ore at the sur-
face awaiting a reverberatory. With the
wet season consignments will have to stop.
To keep up shareholders’ peckers Tom
Husband gives ore in sight as 26,000 tons.
The length of the lode driven on is 260 ft. “of
solid ore, Bft. wide in one place, bulking
16 p.c. copper and 20oz. silver per ton.”
Since then a shaft near the south boundary
has got on to 4ft. of “good ore.” Manager
Callanan isn’t diffident over Coronet Hill,
for he says: “The mine in my opinion is as
good as any I have se n. and I have seen
most of the copper-mines in Queensland,
very few of which have a shoot of ore as
long as that of the Coronet Hill —that is to
say, without a break.” What will Callanan
say when he hears that Mount Oxide starts
off with 80,000 tons of 20 p.c. ore and at
least another 120,000 tons of 10 p.c. ore?
J. H. Gillies’s carbide plant at Electrona,
near Hobart, is completed, and directly the
Speck Government has received the trans-
formers which it is importing, Gillies will
set the furnaces going. To have every-
thing handy wffien the hour for
the current arrives, he is getting in 1500
tons of limestone from the Ida Bay quar-
ries. Then, when cash becomes more plenti-
ful and the plant is buzzing out its 5000
tons of calcium carbide annually, the lime-
stone will be brought to the station by the
old Anchor mine aerial, removed from
Lottah. Coal for the coke is to be got from
the Sandfly pit close by. over which Gillies
has an option. His electrolytic process for
treating zinc ores is also being got under
way, part of the equipment being to hand.
Ore for this enterprise is booked from the
unknown Jupiter mine near Rosebery. So
it looks as if Tassy will soon have three
zinc electrolytic processes at work, of
which Gillies’s represents Australian brains
and the other two Yankee methods. Inci-
dentally it may be remembered that Gillies
invents and organises for the Hydro Electric
Power and Metallurgical Co., of Melbourne.

Mount Bischoff (Tas.) puts out a ss. div.
for Christmas, almost on top of the 2s. 6d.
just paid. The record high price of tin is
responsible for the surprise. When the ss. is
distributed, shareholders will have received
£2,472,000 out of Philosopher Smith’s old
show. At the other side of the Speck the
Pioneer forks out Is. and a bonus of Is.,
making the total paid £397,198.
* * * *
The Speck’s Parliament has passed a vote
of £4OOO for the State mine at Zeehan. The
Government will have dropped just on
£20,000 down the shaft when this is spent,
besides all that has been received from the
sale of ore. Directly it has received nothing
back, but the money has helped to tide the
town over an otherwise dead period, and,
through the State mine draining the ground,
a few tributors have been able to make a
crust. Parliament also passed £lOOO for the
Lefroy lead on condition that the co. raises
£lOOO. The co. has already had £lOOO, which
just enabled it to reach the gutter; but
where it was struck it was not payable. Old
hands at Lefroy think the best chance of
finding payable wash is at the junction of
the Red and White leads, about a couple
of hundred feet from where the co. left off.
The New Pinafore and the Back Creek leads
are both idle, waiting to see what happens.
* * * *
Of all the later Malayan things that Cap’n
Miles has told Australia about Bangnon Val-
ley has supported him best. After provid-
ing for repairs and renewals to plant, but
nothing further for depreciation, the P. and
L. account shows a profit of £35,077 for
the co.’s year, which ended in May. During
the year £25,000 (ss. per share) was divided,
and since then another £lO,OOO (25.), mak-
ing £35,000 within 16 months of starting
the dredge. During the year the average
save was .9921 b. per yard. In the subsequent
five months the average was down to ,6961 b.
The directors explain that the dredge has
been taking out a narrow strip on the
northern boundary, which had to be worked
now or not at all. “The dredge is now
(Nov.) working back towards the good
ground, and in about two months the returns
should justify regular divs. again.” Costs
are first-rate—“all in,” 2.66 d. per cub. yard;
and the manager says that 32 bores put down
a chain apart in the tailings averaged 1.30 z.,
the highest being 310 z., which shows that
recovery is not being sacrificed to get low
costs.
* * * *
Teddy Miles’s Siamese fledgling, the Dee-
book, began life with two dredges, but one
has had to be carted to a fresh nesting-
place on a block of Ronpibon ground. The
other is tin-catching in clayey ground on
the original lease at Renong. Miles, jun.,
has to advise that, while the plant treated
642.586 cubic yards last year and got
230 j tons tin oxide, if the first six months’
work had not been in easy wash, Miles, sen.,
would have had to go in mourning over dis-
appointed hopes. As it is, young Miles
scrambled through, after paying for the
salving and dismantling of No. 1 dredge,
with a profit of £2268. With all costs and
head-office charges lumped in, the total ex-
penditure runs out at 7.81 d. per cubic yard
against 8.657 d. of tin won per cubic yard.
If No. 1 plant costs be discarded, then No.
2 netted £76SO. Any way results are
reviewed they are poor—so poor that Miles,
jun., warns all and sundry that if No. 2
plant cannot put through 70,000 cubic yards
instead of 55,000 cubic yards monthly, the
Renong cake will be poor dough. Mean-
time No. 1 dredge has started on the
Ronpibon lease, where tin is being got, but
clay is causing the same complications.
Until these are overcome it might be just
as well to overhaul directors’ fees, seeing
that they come to almost as much as the
profit netted for the year.
* * * *
Sydney-owned Rimu No. 1 (M.L.) re-
ports a fortnight’s yield of 940 z. gold, which
is a considerable improvement on recent
returns. Shares jumped from ss. to 65., so
there are still backers of this disappointing
dredge proposition. It would elucidate mat-
ters if Rimu No. 1 gave its running costs,
for the dredge is using coal, and that must
be expensive these times. The capital is
£50.000 in £1 shares, so a profit of 50oz.
(£200) per fortnight is required to pay a
dividend of 2s. per annum. The area is 150
acres, and was estimated to contain eight
million cub. yds., worth Is. 7Jd. per yd.
These figures now look absurd, yet the
directors don't seem to have made any
attempt to re-estimate values. Even the dredge
doesn’t give the average because the yardage
isn’t reported with the gold yield. Hard-
headed Dunedin, which scoffed at the esti-
mates, knew a thing or two, as usual.
The insurance cos. doing business in N. S.
Wales had their worst experience last year
over hailstorm risks. Here are the figures
for various classes of business as supplied to
the Government Statistician:—
Total
Net Premiums. Losses. Expenditure.
Fire .. .. £1,043,871 £588,194 £1,022,380
Marine. . . . 344,516 140,009 228,761
Accident . . 50,559 22,833 46,275
Workmen’s Com-
pensation . . 118,163 30,908 80,476
Motor-car .. 38,342 12,190 27,536
Hailstorm .. 64,289 262,587 289,326
Loss of Profits .. 22,016 19,887 25,977
Hailstorm rates have this year been in-
creased about threefold; and on present
appearances there won’t even then be much
profit in the business. One striking feature
is the continued high rate of profit on marine
insurance, notwithstanding the war and its
incidental risks. Another was the terrific
expense rate in connection with accident and
workmen’s compensation business. On these
two allied industrial lines the claims paid
amounted to only 31.9 p.c. of the premiums ;
and if that can’t be improved there will
certainly be ground for urging a change in
the present system of doing the business.
Altogether 22 persons were accidentally
killed on Westralian fields last year. Falls
of ground accounted for 11, shafts and mis-
cellaneous underground eight, surface one
and machinery three. One-half of the fatali-
ties occurred at Kalgoorlie, and 612 of the
847 “serious accidents’’ happened there also.
Compared with the previous year’s figures
fatalities were down 11 and the seriously
injured 76. The appointment of check-
inspectors seems to have had some effect.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
DAVID
JONES
for
SMART
MILLINERY
Sydney, December 10, 1017.
My Dear A a ini, —
There was one very angry Australian on
the Apapa when the Hun’s tinfish got home.
That was Charlie Johnson, brother-in-law of
Sydney’s Deputy Fire-Chief Jackson, who
was in charge of an anti-submarine gun on
board. Many years ago, before the Aus-
tralian Navy was formed, Johnson joined the
Orlando, and later proved Australia’s worth
as a recruiting-ground for the navy by being
top boy for the year in the training-ship
and qualifying for his captain-of-a-gun badge
before he was old enough to wear it. When
the war broke out he was in the Fleet
reserve, and after he had spent a couple of
years with Patey on the Leviathan, the
Board of Trade put him in charge of a gun
on the armed merchantman just sunk. He
was a marksman first-class, but the Hun got
in his torpedo without taking any risk.
From the old Signal Hill Barracks, in
Canadian Halifax, Marconi flashed his first
oversea wireless message. The awful dark-
ness of its foggy winter was experi-
enced by Melba and her concert co. on a
previous trip through Canada. They had to
spend two or three days in their railway
carriage, shunted on to the wharf, while the
booming of the harbor fogbell warned off
shipping. It was a weird and depressing
experience.. Now all the city is in mourning:
for an explosion in the harbor has sent four
thousand of the watersiders to their graves.
The Women’s Handicrafts show is much
the best the society has achieved. Lingerie
of cobweb texture, as well as more stoutly-
built garments that can face the hand that
rules the laundry, and anything from a bath-
mat to a silk cosy, was piled up on half a
dozen stalls. Silk fruit —very little dearer
than the edibles the dark-eyed gentleman
sells in the apple-shop—is a cute trimming
on some of the furnishings. Mrs. Arthur
Chauvel had a niche for her fanciful paint-
ing on satin ; Mrs. Sansom and Molly Bam-
berger were entrenched each behind her own
repousse leather work ; so were Mrs. Spring
and Miss Booth Jones. In a quiet corner
Mrs. Moxham’s sweets —there were straw-
berries that looked fresh-picked—were
samples of Australian confectionery that
equalled the best imported that ever were.
At the just-closing Handicrafts show
there was an exhibit of inlaid satin-wood.
The woi'k —notably the square top for a
table —was not only of unusual merit, but
unique. The exhibitor, a returned wounded
soldier, is still at Graythwaite, North Syd-
ney. His greatest desire is to save his
country the expense of keeping him. Too
lame to return with other patched-up heroes
to the Front, he is hoping to catch the eye
of Australians who can afford to buy his
specialty. Unfortunately, the modest way in
which this exhibit, without even a name to
it. appeared in the Education Galleries
made no appeal to Darling Point. But he
is going to make some sales and get some
orders before Christmas. Isn't he?
An old Riverview boy, Brendan Lane Mul-
lins, only son of John, will have his memory
perpetuated in a medal for Australian His-
tory. This annual award goes to the lad
who knows most about the story of his own
country when he leaves Lane Cove. John’s
gallant son fell last June.
Riverview, by the way, which had its
prize-giving party the other afternoon, owns
the Australian who is on the most intimate
terms with earthquakes. He is the shy Father
Pigot—so shy that, though a brilliant
pianist, hardly anyone except the birds ever
hears his magic music.
The rumor that Yerbrugghen is going to
America, not ..at his own expense, on a long
holiday, but at the State’s, to choose instruc-
tors in singing and music, gains ground. If
it should prove to be true there will be
razors in the air. That the choice of the
staff in the first place fell in some instances
very far short of Conservatorium standards
is true. Whose fault was that? The
Master did the choosing. Australia is wide.
He picked all his shells by Sydney’s sea-
shore.
The artistic coming-on girl is not to be
passed over in the Society of Artists’ show.
Charming bits of color come from Alice Cres-
wick, Myrtle Innes and Dorit Black. The
accomplished Ruby Winckler sends in some
of her fine black-and-white work —not for
sale. It is chiefly the domestic and other
machinations of that dashing buccaneer.
Ulysses. Florence Mofflin serves up nymphs
at play on painted silk fans. In a doorway
hangs the Pearl o' Dreams, set in a silver
fantasy by Rhoda Wager.
The mother of the impressive lady whom
we knew as Mrs. Cog-lan, in the days when
Timothy her husband wrote such interesting
books of statistics for us that we actually
read them, died in Lewisham Hospital last
week. The old lady lost her husband 20
years ago : he was I). C. Donnelly, M.L.A.
for Careoar until he died.
Trippers to Tassy who left the booking of
their berths late must stay on the mainland.
Boats are chock-a-block till the end of
January. The Cullens are not going to their
usual cool spot at Fern Tree, so the Sam
Griffiths have the cottage for three months.
The great lawyer’s wife is getting better after
a serious illness, and hopes to finish the cure
in the Apple Isle.
There’s to be much clicking of high heels
at Society’s effort for the 4th, the 56th and
the Ist Australian Machine Gun Comforts
Fund. Blessed in socks and cigs. is he who
belongs to these heavily-gilded units! A
“short sketch” by Lady Doris Blackwood and
Captain Verge is among the variety turns.
Repertory Theatre, Dec. 15 and 17.
One of the best sidelines of the Boys’
Brigade is its crafts work. Ingenious and
tumultuous youth, engaged in selling uncer-
tain “vict’ries” for a penny, finds its hands
in the Brigade quarters, Surry Hills. Deft
carpenters, masters of the fretsaw, and
patient basket-weavers are made in the
leisure moments of those small and spider-
like forms which climb over the polished
boots of the city man to sell him a “final.”
A fine crafts display garnished the Boys’
Brigade concert at the King’s Hall last
week.
The War Chest has passed on £lOO to the
appeal for the soldiers’ youngsters at Christ-
mas. Premier Holman is president of the
committee, which asks for £l5OO. Hon.
treasurers are now on the beat for the coin.
But there’s one line in the appeal to which
a query-mark can be summarily attached —
“The forthcoming festive season.” Contri-
butions received at Dalton House, Pitt-
street.
The Yal Osborne pair are back from Mel-
bourne. He spent part of his holiday in a
private hospital.
The Red Cross executive has formally ex-
pressed its loss in the death of Mrs. Danger
Owen. It might also have insisted on new
blood in its war-worn body. There are a
few prominent workers—not often in the
public eye, because they hide their good
deeds—who are cracking up under the nerve
strain of three years’ incessant and strenu-
ous toil. They invariably refuse to be re-
lieved, and hang on to their honorary jobs
like barnacles to a ship’s bottom. If a"presi-
dent with a fist could sort things up, three
months’ leave without the option would be
handed to women whose jangling nerves are
calling for a rest.
Two delicate bits
of color hang in the
Society of Artists’
inner room. Blue
water, and a boat
,vith youngsters
afloat. Both are in
the same line of
vision. Maude Rus-
sell, one of our young
artists trying for a
place amongst the
stars, is responsible
for the clever little
sketches. She was a
pupil, first, of Julian
Ashton; then she
went on to London
and had the luck to
sit at the feet of
Frank Brangwyn
before he became too busy to continue with
his art school. Brangwyn. A.R.A., and hon.
member of every other famous society in
Europe—and to a Japan Society, too —gave
his students style and courage. With these
in her kit, Maude Russell is beginning to
push ahead. Here is her face in a frame
of corn-colored hair.
The handsome ’Murkan Quaker, Prof.
Trueblood. has been giving out the Word in
Hobart. The subject was garlanded with the
flowers of speech that decorate the trained
public orator in the States. Jane Adams, by
the way, is regarded as one of Uncle Sam's
most forceful platform speakers. The True-
bloods come back to Sydney in a few days on
the way home to Michigan.
Miss Monie snatched an hour from her
Red Cross w r ork —overtime six days a week—
to pour out tea for Nina Murdoch at the
Australia on Friday afternoon. The previ-
ous day was the Presswomen’s linen party
to their erstwhile mate. Mrs. Grover was
in charge, and the heroine retired with hve-
and-twenty brown-paper parcels, boxes, etc.,
and an exquisite water-color —a mountain
gully, a misty veil and a trickle of water —
by Sidney Cocks.
It isn’t often a pontoon gets a birthday
party or a christening. But the huge crane
that’s to be the big dot-and-carry-one at the
naval dockyard got a splash of wine when
Mrs. King Salter called it Titan the other
day.
One of the items of information that
Count Yon Luckner gave to his guard during
his detention in the Suva (Fiji) gaol was
that it had been his intention to go to some
small town and take it for a week to allow
his men recreation. He would have com-
mandeered the shops, picture-shows and all
places of amusements and anything else
necessary. His audience understood what he
meant. This happened within a few days’
sail of Australian ports. If the shirkers
could only realise that their own womenfolk
might easily have been included in the pro-
posed Ilun outrage!
Watriama, no w
helping in recruiting
work, is as proud of
his honorable posi-
tion in the A.I.F. as
he is of his royal
blood. Before the
war he used to inter-
view Australian
Governors and others
about his right to the
throne of the Loy-
alty Islands, which
he wanted Britain to
take over from
France. Now' that he
has fought alongside
the French, he’s not
in such a hurry
about the Loyalties.
Watriama fought in
S’Africa, too, and
enlisted here in August 14. In the
New Guinea expeditionary force he acted as
sergeant, but w r ent to France as a private.
He w r as wounded several times, and Pozieres
put him out of action. The shell w'hich hit him
in the leg also took a leg clean off a comrade
near by. When Watriama recovered con-
sciousness. he told the stretcher-bearers that
he had lost a leg and would like them to
go back and get it. Smiling, they went back
and recovered a leg; but it proved to be his
mate’s missing limb. The man who had
actually lost the perch thought Watriama’s
illusion a great joke. “Those boys laugh at
everything,” he says. “They’re true sports
and great soldiers.”
There's a Melbourne pianist, Jessie
Masson, over here for the Phil, concert this
week. She’s one of the recently-returned-
from-Europe musical boxes.
The Motor Yacht Club has been doing its
little fortnightly turn for wounded Billjim
ever since he came hobbling home. Its lead-
ing officials. Albert, Spencer Nolan and
Milne, devote every other Saturday after-
noon to the sick lads in Randwuck Hospital.
They glide them round the harbor, then
land them at the club house under the
leafy shoulder of Woollahra Point. Tea,
baccy and music shake the folds out of the
rest of the afternoon. The motor-boat men
have been so quiet about this fortnightly
jaunt that only themselves and the car
owners—it takes about 20 to bring the sojers
to the seaside —know of it.
Mrs. 1 G. F. Abbott, whose silvery tones
have been floating round the Highland
Society’s rooms, has given her reasons for
asking Australia and Maoriland to throw a
coin or tw T o to the Scottish Women’s Hos-
pitals. Mostly they are subtle with feminine
argument. “The countries that give most
generously are the countries that will go on
giving. Because Australia has been so
magnificent in her w r ar funds. I now appeal
to New South Wales for £20.000.”
Since the original formation of a men’s
committee for the Scottish Women’s Hospi-
tals Fund, the other sex has been admitted.
Dr. Mary Booth, Dr. Kate Knowles, Mrs.
Leonard Dodds and Miss Board —daughter
of Peter —have been included. Proceeds of
Russell Sinclair’s lectures on “The British
Woman at War Work” go to this fund.
The Alex. Davidsons are honeymooning in
ictoria. She was Enid Badgery a couple
of weeks or so ago, daughter of the late .T.A..

Everything else having been said about
the late matinee for the Hospice for the

tions over the cheque. Mrs. John Barlow
voiced the gratitude of the Mother Rectress
at the handing over of £474.
“Australia Jane’s” word from Brisbane:--
Our Apollo Club choir and orchestra did “Lochin-
var” the other night from the music of Bananaland's
own pianist, Percy Brier. Some fine descriptive
passages marked the effort, particularly the opening
bars, giving a vivid impression of a galloping horse;
and a quaint old-fashioned dance preceded the verse
in which the young man invites his lady to “tread a
measure.” The parts of the father and the abductor
were arranged as solos. The blushing composer was
dragged on to the stage after the show and handed
a small gold harp as a souvenir.

You’ll remember Philip Potts, who went
ahead for Dolores and later piloted Ella
Caspers through an Australian tour. Phil
enlisted by the early door, and word comes
now that' he’s been mentioned in despatches
for “conspicuous devotion to duty.” Pro-
moted Captain, too.
Captain Wilton Hogg, of the R.A.M.C.,
adds a bar to his Military Cross. He went
from Melbourne Uni. at the end of his medi-
cal course early in the row. Now he’s to
have a spell, and comes this way shortly.
He’s a grandson of the late R. W. Hogg and
James Devlin, both well-known Sydney men
in past years.
Last week’s almost unexampled devotion
to Sister Susie’s good works left the social
side high and dry. Even tea-parties wilted.
Now there’s a slight rally and the efforts to
be festive —if you abstain from reading the
cables —show 7 slight signs of improvement.
Meta Mills got up a good programme for
the Ist Light Horse Comforts Fund the
other night. James Burns was president of
the committee, w 7 ith the busy Lighthorse-
woraan, Mrs. Venables Vernon, as first aid.
Yours affectionately. ,

Melbourne, December 10, 1917.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The State Parliament opened at the old
address, with a most exclusive party for tea
afterwai’ds. President Davies and his wife
flanked the doorway to the tea-room and
welcomed everybody. Lady (Stanley did not
appear, but his Ex. was there in all his
glory. General Williams came in decorated
khaki, and secretary Victor Hood and Gent-
help Conant attended their feathered chief.
New Speaker Mackey wore gown and wig,
and his lady looked like a rare parrot in
blue with a yellow feather neck-ruff. The
new Gaud Mayor was there with his lady.
She put plaid ti'immings on her blue gown.
Norman Bayles’s bride was in dove-grey.
Mrs. Agar Wynne wox'e a pleased smile and
a brown costume. Mrs. Frank Clarke was
in all-white with a wide-spreading hat. The
tea-room was heaped with ii’ises —Melbourne
is proud of its iris blooms this season. The
Botanical Gardens were responsible for some
of the Parliamentary decorations.
Fashion sniggers at the Thrift Weekers.
National economy is nothing to those who
sit thumbing the fashion-plates and picking
out the expensive styles for next year. Last
winter the heavier costumes for women had
a hip-length coat. It didn’t take so much
stuff as the older outfits with flowing
draperies; and as the average tailor-made
has enough wear in it to last over a couple
of cold seasons, or more, the short coat was
appai-ently a distinct economy. Now, how-
ever, it is decreed that lovely Woman must
discard her last winter’s clobber altogether.
The 1918 coat is to be exactly 11 inches off
the ground. Any woman who comes out in
anything shorter than that will be a self-
branded out-of-dater —and most of ’em know
their duty to themselves when it comes to a
choice between being a National Economist
or a Back Number. Still, it’s a terrible war,
isn’t it?
The John Maddens performed the solemn
rites at the opening of the Luna Park car-
nival at St. Kilda on Saturday. The C.J.
politely insisted on taking off his hat while
making the usual affable remarks, but the
family crowded round, amid great enthusi-
asm, and urged him not to risk a cold in
the head by exposing the thinly-thatched
places. All Jewry was at the turn-out, and
th*re was the usual orgy of raffles and sell-
ing of oddments for the Red Cross and Aus-
tralian Comforts funds. The first day alone
brought in £l3OO.
The Hagelthorns’ grounds in Malvern
were trampled by a huge crowd of people on
Saturday afternoon. But Mrs. Hagelthorn,
wearing a blue dress to match her blue eyes,
seemed perfectly happy, for it all meant a
heavy bag of money for the patriotic funds.
Lady Stanley opened the bazaax'. She looked
charming in a cool garden-party top with a
wide-brimmed garden hat, and carried an
armful of blue larkspur and water-lilies.
Mrs. Alex. McKinley accompanied her round
the stalls, while Captain Conant stalked in
the rear. He wore a starched striped collar
with his (otherwise) formal frock-eoat
outfit. The feature of the show was the
Dolls’ Court, which was a centre tent full of
patriotic waxen beauties (the real ones wei’e
serving tea and strawberries elsewhere).
Mrs. Geoffery Syme gave Britannia. Consul
Medini and his wife donated a Nicaraguan
doll in national dress. Consul Ah Yet had
a pair of Chinese brides on show. Mrs.
Staughton and Mrs. Davidson had spent
pounds and jewels on a wax Ranee. Chile
was represented by a brunette fairy and
some exquisite lace. Mr. McKinley worked
hard at the crowded corner where the spin-
ning-jenny was located; and bachelor
Barros, the Chilean Consul, acted elegantly
as afternoon-tea aide and escort.
Mrs. Orme Masson, whose husband pro-
fesses chemistry at the Uni., is now an
editor. The new job is part of Mrs. Masson’s
daily work for the L.M.P. League, the jour-
nal being a little monthly mag. in which
are recorded Billjim’s appreciations of the
work of the Town Hall toilers. The League,
though it gets through a vast quantity of
work on the same lines as the Sydney War
Chest, doesn't receive the amount of eash-
bringinv advertisement which it might
reasonably expect from the daily press, so
the new print will help to fill a growing need
as a cash-coaxer.
The big annual demonstration and con-
cert for the Ragged Boys’ Home (what a
forbidding name that is!) raged at Mel-
bourne Town Hall on Tuesday evening. One
of the R. Boys’ humble comedy-acts was a
scramble for pennies dll over the platform.
The audience clamored for more when John
Amadio blew tenderly on his magic flute to
his pretty little wife’s accompaniment. She
is an artist at the difficult piano job. Mabel
Mattingley starred, and returned Lieut.
Young sang. All to fill the boys’ Christmas
stockings.
The Clarkes will probably think twice
before turning the Sunbury castle upside
down for a second patriotic frivol. One
day last week they got in about a ton of
rich food and drink for the interior furnish-
ing of 100 French sailormen who never
arrived owing to some ghastly bungle. A
lot of the Best People motored up from Mel-
bourne to help the function along; but it
funked altogether. The Best ate, drank and
smoked as much as they could; but the
Clarke dogs and the family cat don’t want
to see roast turkey again in this life.
Some young people’s war-time frivols have
relieved the deepening gloom of the social
atmosphere. Margot Mcßean got in with a
two-stepping affair the night after Margaret
Yencken presided over a band of foxtrotters.
A recent dinner frivol happened on a Sunday
night. After the feed the guests frolicked
like lambs at nursery games, and one of the
merriest players was a war-widow of a few
months. Reaction, perhaps.
Mrs. Pearce, in a trim white suit and a
toy bouquet of lavender, had tea with an in-
teresting bunch of war nurses last week.
There was skirted Major Richardson, boss
of all the Australian war nux-ses, and Sister
Hayes, a Victorian who was wearing her
tropical uniform of dazzling white linen.
Sister Loughrey, rather pale in grey uni-
form, was on the torpedoed Mongolia, and
did some marvellous impromptu splint work
with a bit of an oar and strips of her own
clothing. Sister Mawson was another dis-
tinguished guest. This blue-eyed, fair-haired
woman is whispered about admiringly by her
fellow nurses because of her work on the
Persic. A returned soldier came up to the
bunch to hand out referendum literature.
He and one of the nurses recognised each
other. “You were at Fairfield?” “Yes, in
October.” “Why, you were the arm-case
round the corner of the left wing !” “Yes,
along with ‘Clocks’ So-and-So.” All the shell-
shock men who suffer with head noises have
“Clocks” conferred upon them as their new
first name.
The Green Ball, an annual event of the
first social importance, was bowled last
week. The knighted Bests were prominent
in the balcony amongst the fond mammas,
who looked down on their cherubs pirouet-
ting. The Mayoral Stapleys were also there,
and Speaker Mackey and his wife spectated
close by. Lesley Madden was soon out of
the balcony and down among the dancers.
Jean Clack led an impressive pageant called
“The Empii’e.” There was a good show for
the lookers-on, and the dooi’-money went to
the charities.
Justice Duffy’s elder son, Major Charles,
is getting over a German gassing in an Eng-
lish hospital. The younger T)uffy soldier has
just returned to duty for a second round with
the Hun after a brief health trip to Aus-
tralia. A - third brother sleeps under a
wooden cross somewhere in France. The
fourth, barred by ill health from active ser-
vice, passed out suddenly a few months back.
Edward Fanning, dead at 69, was a gilded
pillar of the Melbourne Club. He was
married twice —on each occasion to a
daughter of the late David Moore, the wine-
merchant who owned the Charnwood Estate,
old St. Kilda’s choicest spot. There were
three children of the second marriage. Beryl,
the only Fanning daughter, used to spend
her spare hours, in the intervals of fluttering
around the bright lights of Toorak, as a
singing-student at the Uni. Conservatorium ;
but her efforts never led past the drawing-
room. Two sons. Major Rupert. D. 5.0., and
Major Bill, are with the Artillery in France.
The Motts motored 1700 miles from their
Bananaland station to see the Cup. Nursie
and the two youngster's came also and forded
the flooded roads near the Victorian border.
One tyre blow-out was the only mishap in
the whole journey. But they have decided to
stay hei’e for the summer before tackling
the 1700-mile trip back.
Oriental Hotel loungers have still the
Pudukota house staff to stare at. The
Rajah, his missus and the ornate baby have
removed to Lister House, but their servants
(cook, valet and maid) stay on at the hotel
because the Lister flat would burst and spill
them into Collins-street if they all tried to
squeeze in. The Rajah has a'delicate taste
in food, and always has his own cook in
tow.
The Tom Hogans have fallen in love with
the Blue Mountains. They even cut the
Melbourne Cup and all the fringing races,
so gi-eat was their infatuation. Jenolan
Caves will be their address this summer.
Tennis-champion Alf Dunlop was exult-
ing over his son’s win of the Singles at the
school sports the other day, when an old
friend with a long memory reminded dad
that he had won the same tournament him-
self 22 years ago.
The Chinese Consul-General’s office has
bought three feather-dusters and is prepar-
ing to receive a new chief w T ho can pay com-
pliments in English, French, Flemish or
Italian, with the best Chinese curses to fall
back on in case he doesn’t want to savee.
T. K. Ouee, the new man, finished his pro-
found education in Belgium and France,
and since then —he is still only 35-; —has been
flying over the earth in the service of the
Department of Foreign Affairs. There is a
Mrs. Ouee, with a small brood of two.
The rich young Widow Horsfall has taken
to spinning in her eyrie at the Oriental
Hotel. She prepares wool and gives it to
the Red Cross. The other sort of Sassiety
spinner spins only the roulette-wheel.
A poignant little tragedy has occurred at
Wirths’ Rest Home, where a bunch of Mel-
bourne girls give their service cheerfully as
Voluntary Workers. Marjorie Locke, of
Malvern, while using an electric mangle, had
her hand so badly crushed that it will pro-
bably have to be amputated. She bore her
agony like an Australian, and stood whilst
the machine was taken to pieces in order to
release her crushed fingers. Added to this
trial, bad news of her soldier-brother had
just come through. He had received wounds
that caused him the loss of a hand.
Two garden-parties will happen at Federal
Government House in this month. The Fer-
gusons are inviting the Australian Army
Nurses for Friday, December 14, and the
Nurses of the Metropolitan Hospitals for
the following afternoon.
Mrs. Charlie Fairbairn has climaxed all
her recent excitements (including the mar-
riage of daughter Esther) by indulging in
appendicitis. She is now in a private hospi-
tal.
Henry Cornish and his wife, who went to
Honolulu to recuperate expensively after in-
tense Red Crossing, have not come home
yet. A friend says they have rented a wiiole
Pacific island. It has a cocoanut palm or
two and a summer palace rushed up by some
millionaire.
Miss Adelaide’s revelations :
War Savings Day, on Friday, added about £28,000
to the War Loan, and country returns have yet to
come. The street procession was the best we have
had since pre-war days. Every feature, from thfe
displays of national industries and resources to the
tableaux, was striking.
Lieut. L. N. Ward, of the Aviation Corps, a son
of the late Ebenezer, M.L.C., who left here with the
3rd Light Horse, has been reported missing in
France since November 20, after more than three
years’ service without furlough. By the way, Lieut.
L A. Whitington, whose death was misreported
weeks ago, has now been listed as wounded and a
prisoner.
The Hackett widow has gone back to Westralia to
set her house in order prior to settling down with
us as Mrs. Frank Moulden.
On Saturday we had the Children’s Hospital fete,
opened by Lady Galway, to remind us that there are
other things than war funds to be financed. In
the evening the Carnation and Sweet Pea Society
arranged an exhibition in the Victoria Hall in aid
of the Y.M.C.A.’s Army Fund, while at Gilberton
there was a “continental” and concert to buy trench
comforts for the Artillery.
Miss Farnie Thomas’s exhibition of water-colors is
to be opened by Lady Galway this week. Proceeds go
to Red Cross Funds.
According to custom a toast was drunk to the
memory of Colonel Light at the Town Halil on
Monday, the silver bowl presented by Colonel
Palmer in ’59 being used. But contrary to custom
women were included in the new Mayor’s list of
guests. Another innovation was the entertainment
of a party of the hatpin sex at luncheon at Parlia-
ment House during the week, with Miss Ada Reeve
as the guest of honor. The Minister for Repatriation,
Mr. Blundell, was host, and the Executive Com-
m’-ttee of the Returned Soldiers’ Assoc, gave him
moral support.
At the Red Cross “gala revue” last week there was
a joyous party of returned wounded soldiers and
the nursing staff from Keswick Military Hospital.
Mr. Abe Shannon bought the whole of' the boxes
for their comfort.
The bushfire fiend has made an early appearance
owing to the heavy grass a wet winter has given us.
A grass fire eastwards from the Burra swept thou-
sands of acres clear and owners lost hundreds of
sheep. Farming is a gay life.
Adelaide’s best-known eye specialist, T. K. Hamil-
ton, has died of pneumonia, aged 64. While a
country practitioner—S. Australia has numerous
medical Hamiltons—T.K. specialised in eye, ear and
throat, in the days when it w r as common to bunch
the three. Eye-sufferers who have felt many hands
say that “T.K.’s” were the most velvety they had
ever met; and he performed the most delicate of
operations. In the spare time that he really didn’t
have he was a director of the A.M.P. ; and he was
devoted to the Church of England and to dogs. He
had been waiting for the war to be over to publish
a book on the diseases of the latter. It is now in
the printer’s hands.

The Best People are buzzing over the
latest London news that Alfreda elder of
the Admiral Bridges feminine quartette is
booked for a wedding with Naval Secretary
Share, who decorated the Northcote staff so
brilliantly and now drives a busy pen for
Admiral Jellicoe. Alfreda is tall and slight

More white bows for the circus whips'
Geo. Wirth last week received a cable froni
sister Mrs. Martin, in New York, stating that
daughter Stella is to be married on December
12 to Phil St. Leon, son of Gus St. Leon
proprietor of the show now touring Gipps-
land. This is the second circus wedding of late
The previous one linked up the old English
circus names of Gennett and Transfield
The contracting parties that time were
Nellie Rowland, daughter of the lady who
was once Amy Gennett. and Tony Trans-
field. It happened at St. Kilda on Novem-
ber 17. The Wirths and the St. Leons are
the pioneer circusmen of Australia. John
Wirth, father of the present Wirth Bros.,
ran a circus through Australia as early as
1856, and John St. Leon came from Tas-
mania with his show about the same time.
Young _ Melbourne singer Gertrude
Johnston is taking the big soprano parts in
Count Filippini’s Opera Co., which is tour-
ing Bananaland. The other night in Rock-
hampton she demonstrated a most melodious
corf as Violetta in “Traviata,” and was
nearly obscured with bouquets. Balboni and
Dagradi. as well as Filippini and some other
members of the late Gonsalez Opera Co.,
are conspicuous in the musical invasion.
A well-known Melbourne idol, now recu-
perating. was called on by a female admirer
who brought him a bunch of sweet flowers,
lie took them petulantly, sniffed them with a
lackadaisical air and murmured, “They don’t
smell as sweet as a bottle of champagne!’’
Here is the lady’s chance to send him a
bouquet of nice fresh corks.
Mrs. 11. J. Smith, who played Niobe in a
recent patriotic Playhouse production, is
making a hit in private theatricals. Her
husband is a rich Australian who is playing
a fighting gent.’s part at the war. He dis-
covered and married his Junoesque wife in
England.
The warriors of under 20 are nowadays
weeded out of Broadmeadows and other
camps and sent to the Domain. The boys
elsewhere lightly refer to the Domainers as
the War Babies. But the babies assay
more genuine enthusiasm to the pound than
the ancients. It’s when they get to the
other side that they are apt to crumple up
under a long strain. The artillery officers
have found that out particularly.

“Bungarus' : About this snake-venom
potency matter, permit me to butt in. The venom of
all snakeijjpiay be classified under two groups—colu-
brine and viperine. Colubrine venoms (such as cobra,
karait and Australian brown snake) kill by paralys-
ing heart and lung action ; viperine venoms (such as
chain viper, puff adder and death adder) by rapidly
clotting the blood. Either, when used in the manner
it is designed for—which is the killing of small
animals, reptiles or birds for food—acts with about
equal rapidity, which is to say almost instantane-
ously. A snake is not designed for following up an
active wounded animal, and when it kills for food it
inflicts death very suddenly. Used for defence on
large animals, such as man, the colubrine venoms
are, weight for weight, more rapid than the viper-
ine ones. Neither group varies much in potency in
itself, the rapidity of the result depending mainly
on the dose injected and the depth at which it is
deposited in the tissues. Certain viperine snakes
possessing strong and long, hollow, pointed fangs
and large poison glands, inject a large dose deeply,
and hence produce rapidly fatal results. Most colu-
brine snakes have grooved and relatively small
fangs, and thus kill more slowly, or, as in the case
of the black snake, do not inject enough to do more
than make a man ill for a few hours without killing.
A\ right for weight of venom our tiger snake is
amongst the most poisonous in the world, his venom
possessing some of the characteristics of both the
colubrine and viperine groups; and though he has
grooved teeth and small glands, his habit of hanging
on and squeezing out as much poison as possible ren-
ders him more dangerous than his hypodermic outfit
warrants. Sea snakes have potent venoms, but their
fangs are small and weak, and their mouths do not
permit a fair bite at a large animal except under
very favorable conditmns. The most rapidly fatal

of all snakes, so far as large animals are concerned,
are probably the great ophiophagi—king cobra,
hamadivad and bushmaster—owing to their large
glands, great size and long fangs.
‘Half-Moon ”: Inside his dark skin the
Torres Strait islander hides more grit than is
generally credited to his account. Last month
while diving in shallow water a “boy” was fearfully
mangled about the legs by a shark. One limb was
reduced to something that didn’t seem worth an
attempt to repair. He had to endure a motor-
launch trip of several hours before the doctor was
reached. On the way he managed a good round
feed. The stitching required was about the same as
would go to making a lugger’s mainsail. The con-
valescent s latest worry is to get back diving again.
“Try Fluke” : About the tea-tree, also the
ti-tree, “Nobody in Particular” (B. 8/11/'l7) is
light enough when he speaks of the general confu-
sion of the two vegetables, but he should not have
included M.L. in the list of places where fi-distilla-
tion has made trouble. Neither the pakefui nor the
natives went in for fi-root grog; that was left for
the old runaway lags and mutinous sailors in the
bouth Seas. The ti, otherwise cabbage-tree or palm-
lily, was, however, an item of food for the Maori in
olden time; and the kauru kind was even cultivated,
especially in the South Island. Taare Tikao, of the
Ngaitahu tribe, has described to me the process of
making sugar from the kauru— it was a regular
autumn industry among the tribes of the great cab-
bage-tree plains. From the kauru- root, steamed and
sun-dried, was made a mealy sweetmeat ; the root,
too, was chewed like sugarcorn. There is still an
ungallant proverb among the tribes which hinges on
the fact that the big mouths of the Ngaitahu ladies
were due to their excessive chewing of kauru root.
It was the chewing-gum of old-time M.L.
“Pick” ; Into the argument as to the dozen
most beautiful Australian birds, let me introduce the
grass-parrot of the tablelands and Riverina, hitherto
not mentioned. It is slightly smaller than the
rosella, shamrock-green, with a blue crown edged
with a thi-n band of white and wings shaded from
cobalt blue to palest grey, a crimson splash on the
lower back and golden underneath. For elegance
and coloring this citizen is the dandy of all the
birds I have seen.

M. J. Cowan’s team at John Boardman’s Bangaroo
station, near Canowindra (N.S.W.), on October 5
Seven men doing over 200 each for one shed on one
day will also take some beating.
“X.Y.” : “Galenon,” referring to those two
Australian diseases, Barcoo rot and Barcoo spew
(B. 22/11 /’l7), is in error in saying that they
have only recently engaged the attention of the
medical profession. In 1885 the late Dr. Cortis,
senior, the parent of that famous family of doctor
athletes, well known in N. S. Wales, devoted much
time to the investigation of the known facts, and he
came to the conclusion that 'the diseases were symptoms
of a malarial condition of the blood. The writer’s own
opinion is that both are caused by flies. In the case
of the “rot,” fly infection of wounds and abrasions
is responsible for the trouble. The peculiar nausea
seems to be the effect of the disgust induced by the
presence of flies. Answering “Galenon” specifically
I say: (1) I have known the trouble to exist when
the best and freshest food was consumed. (2) I
have never known either of the troubles to exist
when flies were not numerous. (3) I have never
known the troubles to arise south of the 30th paral-
lel, although many cases were seen among drovers
and others who had come south in dry seasons.
“Quan” : Forbes (N.S.W.) is puzzled over
the passing-out in great agony of sundry goats, a
few sheep and a couple of cows. Among the trees
planted in the town streets are sugar-gums, and a
few weeks ago their leaves were lopped. Straying
animals had a hearty breakfast of the greenery, and
disastrous result. As stock had been often seen
eating this foliage from the trees without even
suffering indigestion, the Agricultural Department
was asked what chemical change took place in the
leaves after they were cut. It replied that they
were just as poisonous before being lopped as after.
But Forbes doesn’t believe it, and has asked the
Government Botanist what he thinks about it.
‘‘Konoa” : In all probability the plant re-
ferred to by “Itan” (B. 15/11/'l7) as common in
the Western District, where it is known as “castor-
oil plant,” is the thorn-apple ( Datura stramonium).
It is common throughout the South-western slopes
and Riverina, and in Victoria is gazetted as a
noxious weed. It usually grows to a height of
from 18in. to 3ft., is of strong, upright growth,
with forked branches, between which, at their ends,
stout, short-stalked flowers arise. The leaves are
large and almost triangular, with irregularly-toothed
edges; and the flowers, also large, are somewhat
trumpet-shaped, white or purple in color, each
having five points. The plant contains a poisonous
narcotic alkaloid ( daturin ), and in the Wagga dis-
trict (N.S.W.) there have been several serious cases
of poisoning among children w r ho had eaten the
seeds. The true castor-oil plant ( Ricinus com-
munis), when grown under favorable conditions, is
an ornamental shrub from eight to ten feet in
height, with palmate leaves of dark colors bearing
a silvery sheen. The flowers are greenish and in-
significant in appearance, and are succeeded by
bunches of spiny seed capsules. The seeds are large
and prettily marked. About 24 years ago a highly-
ornamental variety ( Ricinus Zanzibar ensis) was
introduced into coastal gardens on account of its

highly-ornaniental bronze-hued foliage. I have met
with the commercial variety (Ricinus communis )
on the coast, where it has escaped from gardens,
and occasionally I have seen growing specimens of
the thorn-apple in those parts.
“Jimmie Pannikin”: I don’t think ~Z~~
can tell “Myall” why the yellow-tailed tit ZT
builds a second nest, an open one on th„ ♦ ber
nest proper. During my many of l° P ? f his
and observing and noting and questioning ■ lne

entirely successful.

the upper nest (1) is meant to deceive the cuckoo
and other intruders; (2) is a place of rest and medi-
tation for papa Tit; (3) is a room for ma Tit to
practise the rest-cure. During my happv, hearty
years in the Yass-Gundagai district, I had the able
assistance of a trained and patient bird-observer
Chas. W. Thompson, headmaster of the Gininderra
public school. One year a yellow-tailed tit built its
nest in the vines that sheltered his residence. He
and his pupils watched the bird-home very closely
without ever finding the top nest occupied.

“Eloc”: Some reliable first-aid for a
poisoned pup. First, take the tops off both ears and
make them bleed well. Second, when the dog is in
his first fit open his jaws with a stick and poke
some fine charcoal down his neck. Third, poke a
handful of salt down. Fourth, swing him by his
hind legs to a tree and turn him round until he
heaves. The best of this lot is the salt. After
cioggy has taken bait don’t let him drink for at
least four hours. The foregoing are for strychnine
only ; if it is a phosphorus bait a spoonful of turps
with plenty of milk or water will cure.

BOOTH'S DRUM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Our sinful town is calm of nights—
No flag of Blood and Fire unfurled—
Except when One-eyed Billy fights,
Or hurls his scorn at all the world.
He sobers up and prays no more ;
No more he testifies the Word ;
Our Army men are at the war,
And Booth’s old drum is never heard.
No more we see the torchlights flare
From Ryan's pub when sinners meet;
No more we hear the brazen blare
Of instruments adown the street ;
With Billy and his brand-new “save’’—■
The reddest guernsey in the land—
And with a haircut and a shave,
Drum-major of the Army band !
No more we see across the “park”
The S.A. Barracks all aglow;
A single gas-jet lights the dark,
A single lassie runs the show.
And other shows—she travels round
To help them here and there a bit;
She knows the Bush, and knows her ground—
She’s very small, but she has grit.
She said to me the other day:
“I wish you would come in to-night;
I think ’twOuld help me, anyway,
And give me better strength to fight.”
I scarce knew what she meant, for she
Hath humor in her winsome face —
I nless ’twould help her heart to see
A Bully bard in halls of grace.
But I grow tired of doing right.
And then I thought I’d let her know
That I was saved one strenuous night,
In old North Sydney years ago,
And “never had no luck” until
I got “run in and fined five bob”
(And also that I never will
Until I lose my stiddy job).
“But that old save's worn out,” she said ;
“And those old days are past and gone.
Come in to-night, and clear your head,
And get a brand-new save put on.
You know that I'm a stranger here,
And find it very dull and slow”—
She paused, and brushed away a tear—
“ You’d help me more than you can know.'
And so I went, a sinner grey,
And sat amongst the earnest few,
And prayed, when she said: “Let us pray”—
Or, rather, I pretended to.
And when the others rose to go
(They very seldom stay out late)
She sat, for half an hour or so,
Beside the Unregenerate.
She showed me (sitting by my side)
A letter from a chaplain’s hand
That told her how her sweetheart died
A hero's death in No Man’s Land.
I’d known them both in days gone by,
What time the ehaplain used to swear.
I read the lines and saw that my
Unworthy name was mentioned there.
Then, blind with tears, she bowed her head ;
But just as soon the tears were stayed.
“Now, brother, let us pray,” she said--
And then her “brother” knelt and prayed.
And far, or near, it seemed to me,
Or yesterday, or long ago,
In this town, or across the sea,
Booth's drum was sobbing soft and low.
But what the Army people lack
Shall be in full restored to them ;
For “Captain Tom” is coming back
With one leg and a D.C.M.
And Booth’s old drum shall wake .once more
(Good Lord! They’ll bang the barracks down!);
And One-eyed Billy, as of yore,
Shall save the humor of the town.

The Stewart Phonograph is the only machine of its kind ever placed on the market. It has been imitated but never equalled. While it measures only 11
inches in diameter at the base, and stands only 6 inches high, it is the only COMPACT hornless Phonograph ever made that will play the LARGE,
STANDARD 12-INCH DISC RECORD, and it is the only Phonograph of any size that will play both vertical- and lateral-cut records of any make.
The Design, Construction and Finish
of the Stewart Phonograph
is Exceptionally Good.
The quiet, even-running worm-drive motor
alone is worth the price of the machine.
It is constructed for service. Has auto-
matic stop on tone-arm which prevents the
needle damaging records; also has regu-
lating lever for giving desired time and a
special, patented, reversible reproducer
which can be used with either vertical- or
lateral-cut disc records —the only machine
made with this feature.
The frame is made of all metal, and is
neatly finished in a rich dark-green and
nickel. The sound-box gives a clear, life-
like reproduction.

The Stewart Phonograph will make a most acceptable Xmas Present. This is proven by the fact
that large numbers have already placed their orders for Stewart Phonographs for this
month. It is a present that will be appreciated by everyone. Remember your friends 11 want to
play all-size records, 12 inches included, and you will want them to have a Phonograph that is neat
in appearance and one that will give them long years of service. Therefore, see that the
machine you purchase bears the Stewart trade-mark.

“Cowshoof”: Now that we have nomi-
nated our fancies for the noisiest and sweetest of
the Australian birds, fork out your three favorites for
the Popularity Stakes. For all-round good points I
pick the Jack, the Maggie and the black swan.
* * * *
“Mookingah”: George Riley, of Tiboo-
burra, in his spare time during Mt. Wood shearing,
shot 125 kangaroos; net proceeds for skins, £39 odd.
Bob Hamilton, at Millring, shooting on his own,
got one thousand skins in four months; Jack
Edwards and Billy Bonnett, of Milparinka, working
mates, 300 skins in three weeks, among-st them being
a white one—not a light-colored one, but a white
one. Kangaroos are in droves in the Far Nor’-AVest
of N. S. AA’ales. Six hundred were counted in a
station horse-paddock recently. Riley averages 85
to 90 kangaroos for every 100 bullets. Try to beat
that 1
* * * *
“Quo VajJis” : While you’re on the job of
dealing out first-aid to poisoned dogs, can you tell
me the way to save a pup poisoned by phosphorus?
No sign of the trouble is visible for the first day and
night, but after that the animal has difficulty in
swallowing, the body swells and he walks with
effort. In my fellow’s case the symptoms appeared
too late to save an old friend. The poor chap sought
cool places and water to lie in. I was compelled to
destroy him because his suffering was too acute to
be borne by either of us.
“Dingo”: According to Beveridge, a
dingo-liunter who used to work out west of Lake
Torrens and in the country north of Lake Gairdner,
aniseed is a pretty sure draw for a dingo. There
was one thing and one thing only which would,
under certain conditions, beat it; but I would not
like to say what that was.
* * * *
“Bung”: Someone said (B. 1/11/T7)
that skins of the rock-wallaby have little commercial
value. Well, I have heard £lO refused for a rug
that held 45 of them, and along the spurs that
bank the Murrumbidgee I knew hunters who, years
ago, made a good thing by getting them for city
furriers. The fox has now nearly wiped out this
interesting little acrobat, but under the rocky cliffs
that bound the eastern summit of the N.S.W. South
Coast ranges, and along the Shoalhaven valley,
where 6nee they sported in thousands, remnants of
the tribe may still be seen. Of late years a small
colony has retired for sanctuary to National Park,
south of Sydney. They are trustful and docile
little chaps, so easily taken or shot that hunting
them never was sport. _
“Jackdaw” : How is this for a record high
pile bridge? Length about 600 ft. The top piles
that support the rails soar 60ft. into the air. These
are clumped and bolted to other piles that are
stamped 70ft. into Victoria. The peg-legged centi-
pede straddles Stony Creek on the Bairnsdale-
Orbost line, and was built about five years ago of
ironbark and greybox felled on the premises.
» * * *
“Belmont”: In the Sackville (N.S.W.)
district a little time ago I bought a two-months’-old
sucking-pig from a man who lived about three miles
away. I took delivery at night-time, put the
porker into a bag and went home. I locked him in
a barn for the night, but next morning he was gone.
That afternoon the ex-owner sent him down to me.
To get home the squeaker had to swim the Hawkes-
bury, Ahic-h is about 200 yards wide at" that reach,
and cross rough country which he had never been
over before except the previous night-time and then
in a sack.
“E.S.S.”: Tell “E. 8.” (B. 8/11/T7) that
the male of the black-backed magpie is marked with
pure white on the back of the neck, at the base of
the tail, and on the wings, whilst the female is
marked with a greyish hue instead of white. Simi-
larly, the male white-backed magpie has a snow-
white back, and the female grey. The immature
males of both species closely resemble the adult
females.
“C.J.AV.”: The only generally-reliable
home remedy for poison in a dog is Epsom salts
administered in strong doses. There also is some-
thing in the swinging of the victim round and
round, especially after a strong dose of salts. It
produces vomiting, and this rids Fido of so much
of the poison as has not got into the system.
FOR OUR STOMACH'S SAKE.
SHEPHERD (at temperance meeting ): “ W e will note sing ‘Little Drops of Water,’ and
do let us put a little spirit in it.”
“COLONIAL EXPERIENCE .”
BOSS (to pommy, ringlarhing for the first time ): “Well, how did you get on to day?”
POMMY: “All right. But the dead ones are hard to cut.”
“11.V.E.”: The name “bee-eater” is a mis-
nomer. I know of only one instance in which the
Australian bee-eater ( Merops ornatus ) has been
caught preying on honey-makers. On the other hand
the bird is a very useful insect-destroyer, and pays
particular attention to the purple-black moth with
rounded white spots that deposits its eggs on
grape and other vines, to which the resulting larvae
or caterpillars do much damage. This beautiful bird
(its plumage is a harmony in rich chestnut-brown,
green, blue, orange and black) is nowhere very
common. I’ve found it breeding in tunnels on the
banks of the Snowy River, Southern Monaro
(N.S.W.). Like the eggs of most birds which
incubate in total or semi-darkness, this one’s are
pure white. The two long stiff tail feathers give
the owner, when on the wing, the appearance of a
bird of paradise in miniature. Open timbered
country is its favorite habitat. In W.A., where it
sometimes nests in certain disused railway tunnels,
it is known as the golden swallow.
“Copabella” : It isn’t only tlie townie who
lacks knowledge of the bird life of the bush. One of
my first jobs when I came out from ’Ome was
scrub-falling for a cocky in virgin country under the
shadow of Kosciusko. The hosts of strange birds
that found their home in the scrub provided me
with an ever-interesting camp study at smoke-ohs
and in the early dawn before work began. I asked
the stolid cocky their names as they flew about the
tent. “Oh, that’s a magpie!” said Bill, and
knowing the coloring of the English one I could
appreciate the naming of the Australian bird even
if I wondered at the adjective. (I’ve learnt since,
of course.) My lesson in Australian ornithology
went on through alleged robins and jays (which
were neither), a pee-wee, a ’postle, a willy wagtail, a
laughin’ jack, a green-leek, and a crow.
There the native’s knowledge petered out. “But
those little grey birds with the yellow breasts,” I
said; “and the little brown ones with the cocked-up
tail; and the blue-black one with the speckled neck,
and “Aw,” growled Bill, disgustedly. “'What
a lotta questions you new-chums arsk! They ’aven’t
got no names. They’re just birds!” That was 17
years ago, and I don’t yet know the name of the
common little grey fellows with the canary waist-
coats.
* * * *
“Namoi”: Somebody was looking for a
cure for centipede bite. Our Chow gardener savs
that whenever one of his countlymen is
assaulted by hundred-legs the countlyman at once
looks up a tarantula and puts it on the wound.
John declares that the spider will jump on to the
bitten place, and immediately get to work suck-
ing the poison, giving relief straight away. When
the tarantula has finished pumping it will fall off
ike a surfeited leech. If you want to save it up
for another occasion, drop it into a bucket of water
?' K T IU von,lt the poison and recover; otherwise
it will die.
“Koreki”: I used to know the pioneer
bomb-thrower of Papua. He was a white man, and
to guard himself against sudden attacks by the
natives took the precaution to have a few sticks of
dynamite tied with wire and liberally studded with
any old ironmongery he could pick up about Port
Moresby. Each bomb was completed with a very
short fuse and detonator. To satisfy my curiosity he
one day put a match to one and slung it from the
verandah. The hole it made where the front garden
should have been satisfied me of its effectiveness
against a mob of niggers.
“Jackdaw”: Ironbark logs? I know one
bit of ironbark 70ft. long and 24in. x 12in. This
ribbon of hardwood is scaring fish as keel of the
s.s. Gippeland, running between Bairnsdale and Lakes
Entrance (Vic.) daily. Incidentally, the vessel was
built at Paynesville (on the Lakes) about 10 years
ago by J-. C. Dahlsen. I saw another ironbark
splinter cut three 21ft. lengths and one lift, length
—-total, 7-1 ft. Each length produced three bridge
beams 21in. x llin. without a flaw. Both giants
grew in the vicinity of Lake Tyers (Vic.). Giant-
killer : Bill Humphrey.
“Kawana” : Even busli sledges are not all
alike. At Aotearoa, an old Ilauhau settlement far
back in the King Country of M.L., an abo. sledge-
builder let me into some of the secrets of his
handicraft. The koreke on which he was toiling
was made without nails and iron bolts. It was
to be used for hauling totara sleepers. Another one,
for work in rough, hilly country, was an ihu-poaka,
or “pig-nose,” so called because to the native mind
it suggested a porker rooting in the mud. It
narrowed in the bows; it had the usual runners
forward, but its after-part went on wooden wheels.
The idc-a was that the wheel-less forepart should
act as a brake when going down a slippery track
by digging in its nose; and certainly it acts up
to specifications. Pakeha settlers have taken to the
pig-nose sledge as a top-hole device for carting in
their milkeans in next-to-roadless country.
“Meringa” : “Black Bonnet” (B. 22/11/17)
wonders why chemists haven’t discovered a real cure
for tick-poison in dogs. They have 1 Trypan Blue
is the article. This dye is dissolved and injected
behind the shoulder in doses of five to 25 grains,
according to age of patient. It saves the pup every
time. The Blue has been for some years successfully
used by Bananaland cockies as a cure for redwater
(or tick-fever) in cattle, which disease is very
similar to the trouble that Rover and Bluey get.

The Aged and Infirm
are sometimes more susceptible to COUGHS and COLDS on the
CHEST than the young and vigorous. When an aged person gets
a Cold, it is of the utmost importance that not only is the BEST
REMEDY taken immediately, but that the Remedy is one that
does NOT cause any Heart Depression, nor in any way weaken
an already frail constitution. In such a case, HEARNE'S Bronchitis
Cure is just THE proper Medicine to use, 03 it is the QUICKEST,
SAFEST and BEST — a Remedy that is just as effective with
YOUNG PEOPLE.

£47GS is only just under 15 p.c. Think
are not what they were with J. Fielding
and Co. When the prospectus was issued
in 1910 the vendors didn’t venture to ask
the public to buy more than 12 000
shares, and even that lot wasn’t fully sub-
scribed. Careful yet energetic management
backed by general prosperity, greatly im-
proved the co.’s position during the next
three or four years. Then came the war a
gradual reduction of imports and a rapid
increase of home manufactures. The paper-
box makers would have benefited very much
in any case; but they benefited out of pro-
portion to the general increase of home
manufactures because of the embargo placed
on the use of metal hitherto used in putting
up many goods. The fly in the ointment
has been the increase in costs and the abso-
lute impossibility of getting sufficient card-
board ; but the directors uow report that
two of the mills manufacturing board in
Australia “are taking steps to increase
their plant and output—a vital necessity for
the expansion of this and many other busi-
nesses within the Commonwealth.” The
co. has so improved its status that, whereas
seven years ago it got only a part of the
capital it needed with difficulty, it has now,
since the close of its year, been rushed for
the unissued 7909 shares at par. This will
bring the capital to the authorised £40.000
and will reduce all liabilities to about
£7OOO. Originally £5OOO of the capital
represented goodwill: that item still stands,
hut the accumulated profits have not only
provided £7OOO for bonus shares but have
supplied more than enough tangible assets
to replace the goodwill. Altogether an
excellent record, and a sample of what we
could have had years ago if our politicians
had given u,s that effective Protection for
home industries which the U boats have since
provided. The time will, however, come when
the seas will be open again. What then?
* * * *
From an old prospector and mine-owner:
The performance of the politicians does not
encourage one to feel enthusiastic about any Govern-
ment scheme to organise national energy on a grand
scale, because there are countless illustrations of the
fact that in all the existing avenues of business over
which our Governments exercise control, extravagance,
inefficiency and dilatoriness are at the maximum.
Take, the smelting and refining business, for example.
When, years before the Kaiser broke loose, Germany
began to realise the potentialities of the metal-
refining business, the German rulers took such a
grip of the Freiberg works, and bound them down
by such stringent regulations, that any chance of
malpractice was obliterated. Imperial supervision
over assays, returns, charges, etc., was instituted to
such an extent that even producers overseas knew
that their interests were safeguarded, and as a con-
sequence the name of Freiberg was respected in
mining circles the world over. Can it be said that
the smelting monopoly of which Hughes is apparently
proud stands on the same footing? Is the mining
public serene in the knowledge that the omnipotent
combine to which we must perforce send our copper-
gold and lead-silver ores is so regulated by the
National Government that we are sure of getting
a fair deal and a fair share of the profits? On the
contrary, the care of Hughes and his Government
apparently extends only as far as the smelters;
nobody seems to mind whether the producer and
the miner get a profit or go broke. When the mining
industry, for one, feels assured that the Hughes-Cook
Government has faithfully held the scales of justice
as between the rich smelting cos. and the less rich
mining producers, and has.seen to it that there shall
be no opportunity for a monopoly to exercise great
powers to the detriment of those who are perforce
obliged to deal with it, it will feel considerably
easier in its mind about proposals to allow ambitious
and eloquent politicians a chance for further experi-
ments at the country's cost. The inordinate desne
of politicians to atone for neglect of their present
duty by hatching some alluring scheme for the
future does nothing to amend prevailing chaos, am
gives small hope for an early millennium.

“Digger”: On account of those who con
trol the Westralian State .batteries being
unable to read Wilhelm’s mind. in 1’ e
extra supply of flint was provided lor
in the Wiluna tube mill, and in one
the plant had to be closed. Coming 1
conclusion that this was no good 1 ,
tralia, the manager started to look
and incite others to do the same Q f
result was the discovery of a 8 11 11 •, a

tralian. and (2) it could be had f® l ,
of carting away. Nevertheless it P pro-
equal if not superior to the £l4-P ~j ffaS
duct of the Hun; and the tube
able to start up again.
Business, Bobbery, etc.
“Platman”: Harry Hart, of Springfield
station, Blackall (Q.), is a sticker all right.
He has a bore down on that property
5600 ft., and has only stopped now for want
of casing, though costs lately have run to
£4 per foot. By the way, A. E. Jowett has
struck the first flowing sub-artesian supply
in Queensland, on Blair Athol. It is on
the eastern watershed, and may be the fore-
runner of an important development in
well-drilling.
• * * * *
Maoriland is going to see whether it can
do anything with rubber. In the far North,
at sub-tropical Parengarenga, 200 trees
were lately planted in selected spots. It is
by way of experiment, but a climate that
can ripen bananas and grow the South Sea
taro ought to be able to accommodate rubber.
* * -Jr *
“Tyke”: The biggest thing in wireless
“screens” is Point de Galle. As vessels
near Colombo the cape’s magnetic influence
becomes more marked, and signals fade out
and are absorbed by the mountain at the
corner. It even affects compasses at times,
when ships are approaching from the east.
But the strangest wireless freak is at Socotra
(Gulf of Aden). If you pump a message
into Socotra about half an hour before- sun-
set, and listen, you will hear the message
again, though very weak. The varying tem-
perature about sunset causes some magnetic
change, or reverse, and the previously
absorbed waves are rejected, but they come
out backwards, i.e., the signature comes first.
* * * *
“Try Fluke”: Whale-hunting still pays
exes, and a bit over on the Maoriland coast.
On the Kaikoura beach the other day I saw
a pile of black bone —the best sort —from
the right whale, worth, say, £l5OO. This
came from two big fellows strafed by John-
son’s whaling party, who go -out bombing
and harpooning in the 25-knot oil launches
that have superseded the old six-oar boats.
Besides the bone there was the oil from the
carcases, but the contents of the right
whale’s cavern of a mouth are what most
bomb-lance men are after. The same
party killed several humpbacks. Up at Tory
Channel, where whaling has been carried on
continuously for the last 70 years—old
“Tarwhite,” otherwise Te Awaiti, is
soaked through and through with whale-oil
—the hunters did even better. There are two
launch-running syndicates there, and this
season they raked in 36 humpbacks and one
right whale. The big “right” put up a
monumental fight, and it took eight bombs
to out him. lie was worth well over £5OO.
They go about the leviathan-slaying job on
a rather bigger scale up at Whangamumu,
near the Bay of Islands, where a sea-going
steamer cruises for humpbacks. As for
sperm whales, an old harpooner tells me
they are never seen coastwise nowadays.
Too many steamers.
* * * *
“Flying Jib”: Presently we’ll see every
venerable hulk able to swim across the Tas-
man Sea hauled out of Rotten Row, and
rigged up again as a cargo-wallah. The
U.S.S. Co. is refitting three of its hulks for
sea —the Hartford, the lima and the Lilia.
In the old days the full-rigged Dartford
was used by the big line as a training-ship
(sea-going) for its cadets. She was a fine
figure of a windbag, in which many a young
officer first learned the mysteries of the
weather ear-ring and the art of repeating
the lessons that he learned at mother’s knee
while sending down a royal yard. The lima
was a barquentine, and this rig is being
restored. The only puzzle will be to find
the men for these sail-carriers. Skippers
count themselves lucky to-day if an alleged
A.B. can disentangle the mainsheet from the
crossjack-clewlines.

“Billy Blue” : After being in the Johnston
family for over 90 years, Jier station is on
the market. The property was originally
taken up by Captain Robert Johnston, son
of the Colonel Johnston of the Bligh episode.
Born March 9, 1790, in Sydney, Robert
Johnston was sent to England to be edu-
cated, and at an early age joined the Navy
and saw service under Cochrane. He
returned to Sydney in 1816 and did some
exploring work on the South Coast with
Hamilton Hume, discovering the Clyde
River, which he named. For this and other
work he received a grant of Jier in 1827.
The property runs to about 15.000 acres
freehold.

“Silas”: There was once a squatter in
Australia known throughout three States as
“Dip-it-in-the-Brine.” He used to sell salt
junk to travellers, and to turn the scale his
unfailing precept was—“ Dip it in the
brine” ! With the scientific implements now
in use for squirting the salt water right into
the meat, every big butcher in Australia to-
day is a “Dip-it-in-the-brine” specialist
whose depradations put that old squatter’s
performances into the shade. Twelve pounds
of brine in a piece of beef weighing 421 b. is
no unusual thing nowadays. Tenpence a
pound for it looks like a profitable deal.
They say there is gold in sea water. Every
butcher believes it.
* ’ * * *
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: The busiest
shipbuilding yard in the early days of Syd-
ney occupied the site now covered by Gibbs
Bright’s offices, and the launching was done
into the arm of the cove which ran up be-
tween Gibbs Bright’s and The Bulletin
office. Here, as early as 1803, a vessel, the
Governor King, was built for the Tasmanian
trade, and subsequently the King George.
* * * *
“Bender” : There’s some real decentralisa-
tion about Bendigo. Now that mining has
fallen off there things are very sick out Eagle-
hawk way, and when anyone wants a house
in any handy part of Northern Vic. one of
the empty places at Eaglehawk is pulled
down, carted out and re-erected. Fires used
to be as common as tailings-dumps at Eagle-
hawk, but there are not so many houses
going that way since the insurance cos. got
so confoundedly suspicious.
* * * *
“Kola” : Very few people realise the extent
and variety of Japanese imports into Aus-
tralia. Also, taking a lead from immigrant
Freetraders like W. M. Hughes, they don’t
care a fiddler’s curse. I run a general store,
and for the last year I have kept a careful
watch on the Nippon goods that I have had
to stock. Early, I ran out of European
glassware. I got Jap lamp-glasses first of
all. They were, especially at the start, in-
ferior to the German and to the goods made
in Spottswood (Vic.). But, above all, they
were smaller than the usual sizes. This is
a common fault with Jap goods. Jap egg-
cups that I got were not big enough to hold
bantams’ fruit. Then I got cups and saucers.
The. first lot were decorated Japanese
fashion ; now they are exactly like the old
European article and seemingly as good.
Japanese underwear is also on the small side.
It is usually made in three sizes—ordinary,
small and over-size—and I have to buy over-
size to get anything near my wants. Knives,
etc., are also coming from our happy little
Allies; ditto practically every toy I have
bought this year. Australia is getting a
move on, but slowly. Some very good pot-
tery is coming from the Bendigo potteries.
A omen’s hose was as scarce as sovereigns a
while ago ; now my stock comes from Adel-
aide. The woollen mill at Warrnambool will
also be in the line shortly. Jap matches
are everyvffiere, and they are still not good.
I have not yet been offered Jap tobacco, but
I expect it to come. I wish they could send
us some of their talent for grasping trading
opportunities.
* * * *
“Quidam” : Sunny Corner (N.S.W.), which
has dwindled from its once proud condition of
a prosperous mining centre with 7000 people
to a village of a few hundred, is an illustra-
tion of the fact that it is better to have
boomed and gone bung than never to have
lived at all. It possesses what few Aus-
tralian townships of treble the size do, a
splendid w r ater supply ; and some day there
may yet be use for it —-some day when our
metallurgy has advanced to the stage of being
able to extract economically many metals
instead of only a few from a complex ore.
Were it better known and its advantages
appreciated, what a splendid future as a
health-resort Sunny Corner might have!
Nearly 5000 ft. above sea-level, with good air,
good water and good scenery, and, in addi-
tion, good roads for the übiquitous motor, it
can furnish a fine pick-me-up. A handy
place where the snow lies for weeks in
winter might be worth a lot to the Sydney
plains if they knew how to make right use
of it.

The Federal Government is a lavish
spender, but the stewards of its gifts claim
that they did their duty faithfully on the
East-West line. The pay offices for con-
struction work were at Kalgoorlie and Port
Augusta, and between them they handed out
nearly £4,000,000. Kalgoorlie boasts that
though it made the wilderness its counting-
house it never lost a zac. Port Augusta
admits one loss—when the pay officers were
thrown out of a section car which collided
with a trolley. But there was only about
9d. that wasn’t recovered from the sand.
* * * *
Ihe war is leaving its mark on friendly
societies, too. According to the Queens-
land Registrar the trouble will, on the
rough figures for 1915 and 1916, add to the
deaths 5 per cent, per annum of the num-
ber of members actually enlisted. The
Druids’ lodge figures for five years have
lately been overhauled, in connection with
the usual State valuation, and it is found
that, of 102 male members who died during
the period, eight were killed on active ser-
vice. Incidentally, judged by the Druids’
ngures, the Queensland societies are now in
a sound position to meet the larger calls.
Edge’s total assets were valued
at -os. od. for every £1 0 f liability, whereas
tiie present valuation gives 225. Bd.

„.. i ' his bit of “business” came off on St
Kilda (v ic.) esplanade in broad daylight
last month. l\y 0 young men went up to a
holiday-maker who was reading the ller\ld
on a seat. One advanced and said polßely
' -Uyou mind giving me your Herald?”
Ihe leader glanced up in surprise, and after
a faltering moment answered: “Whv yes

THE PRUDENT SPORT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Wouldst go upon a merry bust
In thy new summer raiment clad,
And through the gay joy-jungle thrust
To reach the cool hop-fountains, lad?
Prom the green boughs of Pleasure there
Wouldst pull red crayfish-garlands down
And twine wild oysters in thy hair?
Expensive sport, I beg to state
With oysters eighteenpence a plate
And crayfish up to half a crown.
On this inviting summer’s night
Art thou obsessed anew, old pal,
By urgent cravings for delight—
The spirit of high carnival ?
Gay girls are plenty, as before ;
Brown is the beer in Melbourne town,
And just as luscious as of yore.
But Joy is not so full and free
These days as once it used to be.
No —not with crays at half a crown !
VICTORIA.

Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort and good
health artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi-
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the
perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

POLITICAL
POINTS
IN TOPHET.
P EEPUS: “Old Actuary us seems busy, eh?”
N OSEUS: “ Rather! A couple of Australian
lawyer-politicians are in holts, and he
is totalling up what it will cost the
country before they close the wrangle."
Stale eggs are rotten arguments.
The yarn is being spread, especially in the
cocky districts, that following upon Con-
scription in Maoriland that country has been
iiooded with black (Hindu) laboi\ The facts,
supplied and certified by the M.L. Govern-
ment Statistician, are as follows: —
Arrivals. Departures.
1915 .. 13 68
1916 .. 92 39
1917(10 months) 71 24
Totals.. 176 131
During the past two years and 10 months
the total addition to the Indian population
of Maoriland is thus 45; and really you
can’t make much of a flood over a country
the size of Maoriland with 45 people.
T. M. Wilford, the new member of M.L.’s
“National” Ministry, was favorite for the
job of Attorney-General in the short-lived
Tam Mackenzie Ministry. He was return-
ing from England when that troupe was
being knocked together, and Mac cabled offer-
ing him the portfolio. Wilford
sent the famous reply “Thanks
for cable.” As he was nearing
home his friends hurled at him
wireless messages exhorting him
to avoid Mac and all his works.
(As if Wilford didn’t know!)
When he landed, the job was
still waiting, but the enemy, led
by Massey, was already ham-
mering at the gates, so the
astute Wilford lay low and said
little. He had brought from
London the score of the then
popular song, “I’m Keeping My
Foot on the Soft, Soft Pedal”
(he’s an amateur mummer),
and when anyone mentioned
Mackenzie’s offer of office he
merely smiled and hummed that
air. Through keeping his foot
on the soft pedal he has had to
wait five years for Ministerial
rank, but he dodged a wreck
which would have settled him
if he had got into it.
The vote on the 20th is to
decide only one thing—whether
the people desire to ensure re-
inforcements by compulsory
drafts from unmarried eligibles
if the voluntary enlistments
fail. A hundred other things
have been pushed into the con-
troversy ; but they are all red-
herrings. The Antis say that
voluntary enlistments will be
ample. If they are, not a man
will be conscripted. The Antis
don’t say what they will do if
the voluntai’y enlistments fail.
The others say that, if that
happens, Billjim must not be
left in the lurch —that the numbers must
be. made up. So the question boils dowm to
this: Shall Billjim be left in the lurch —yes
or no?
Labor is in a curious position in Victoria.
In October, 1915, on the McLeod no-confi-
dence motion, the whole party
voted with Peacock to help him
save his bacon ; and he did it by
39 votes to 20. Last July,
when Bowser got out his little
axe and pursued Peacock, 10
L abor members supported
Peacock and five backed Bow-
ser, w’hile five independent
Laborites also split up, three of
them supporting the Cackle.
The position thus seems to be
that, though the heavens wrnuld
fall if a Labor member took
office in a Ministry which wasn’t
all-Labor, the Labor party isn’t
any longer required to vote
solidly on a motion involving the
fate of a Ministry. Either the
Labor party ougnt to piay the
party game, or abandon party
altogether. At present it lets
itself down between two stools.
“A ust ralian Manufactures
Week” has come to Melbourne
—and gone. With almost
feverish alacrity most of the
shopkeepers have pulled the
“Stop Buying Imported Goods”
signs out of their windows,
pushed the imported corsets
and washstands and rubber
hose up to the front again, and
given Australian goods their
usual shelves in retired corners.
Still at least one management
kept the flag flying into the
next week, displaying a trio of
neat appeals to Australian patriotism—
placed prominently over an attractive show
of Yankee tools!
The Anti case has been most succinctly
stated by the Labor Call (Melb.). In every
issue readers are adjured, in heavy black
type and on every page:—
Don't Argue. Vote No.
Logic doesn’t matter. National safety—
Pish! Obligations to the other fellow?
Rats! Don’t argue—don’t use your intelli-
gence. Just be a slave to your party boss
and vote as he tells you. And then go av r ay
and talk about glorious liberty.
According to Chesterton :
No one can think a nigger burned alive is a
pleasant sight. The sentimental thing is to warm
your hands at the fire while denying the existence of
the nigger.
That is just the attitude of the pacifist. He
warms his hands at the fires of peace and
ignores the martyrdom of the men who are
buying that peace by dying for him in
France or Flanders.
The women are more interested in Decem-
ber the Twentieth than the men. For them
this is the question : Shall Conscription never
be employed to prevent an army invading
this country? The only difference between

“ But, really, are you going to vote No?”
“ Yes , Miss Ethel; one must vote according
to one's bally conscience, y'know.”
“Oh, now I know what Whatsisname meant
by conscience making cowards of us.”
enemy has entered the country. The vote on
the Twentieth is to decide whether we shall
have the right to call on the manhood to go
out and meet the enemy. The question for
women, put plainly, is: “Is it better to keep
them out of the country and fight the decid-
ing battle on foreign territory? If your
brother knew that a man was coming in to
your room to ravish you, would you say that
it was time enough to interfei-e when the
brute had passed through your door?” If
women don’t think so they will vote Yes.
The lie that Conscription means colored
labor is still rampant. It is just as easy
and just as true to say that it means poly-
gamy and free love. But—
(1) If Conscription means colored labor, why did
the Australian Labor party put it on the Statute
books? That party believed, rather, that it meant
a White Australia. (2) If we don’t win, Germany
will; and Germany wants Australia. Do the Antis
know one German colony that is white?
This is the first time Australia ever had to
fight for its white principles; and some of
the very people who might have been ex-
pected to spend the last drop of their blood
in that fight cave in and squeal about the
sacredness of human life.
If there is any more of this egging, the
Prime Minister will certainly bring hens

Archbishop Mannix’s insistence on “Aus-

or two it was in regard to the turning-down

Thougti it has nothing to do with the
■question, the Antis say it is unfair to con-
script life and not wealth. They allege that
the whole money cost of the war is bein»
provided by loans which will carry interest
That is very nearly true. Rut the people
who put up the money will pav it back
themselves. They lend it to the Common
wealth; but the interest will come out of
their income tax and probate and succession
duties, and so will the sinking fund If
wealth is not conscripted to-day it will be

days than any of us can see the end of.
“Country Bed” : Now that a new Govern-
ment ,*-s in power in Victoria, one of the
first things it should do is to close the
German schools. All that happens at pre-
sent is that the State schools’ district in-
spector visits them four times a year instead
of the usual twice. Ask any D.I. and he
will tell you that they are simply centres
of German nationalism. On the other hand
I have children of the third generation from
pure German stock attending my little
school. But they never think of themselves
as Germans; they are good little Austra-
lians, as they all ought to be when they
have reached the third generation, and as 99
per cent, of the others would be if the
State closed the schools where the poison is
given out.
Hobbs's motion to reduce the number of
members in the Speck’s Parliament secured
the support of only half a dozen members—
Whitsitt (Ind.), Pollard (Nat.) and three

solidly against any reduction whatever.

THE FIGHTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He was a bright, pert, youngish bloke, with quite a
lofty dome,
And smooth and shiny hair that draped his marble
brown around ;
And, as he talked and waved his hands, he was as
one at home
In any sort of company, and seemed to like the
sound
Of his own rolling tones, as, in a manner far from
shy,
He told his tale. “By George,” he said, “it was
a bally fight!
But”—here he threw his shoulders back, and laughed
and breathed a sigh
Of full content—“we beat ’em. Yes, we beat 'em
out of sight!”
And, as the train went rattling on, the stout soul
at his side
Applauded in a fruity wheeze: “Yes, boy, you beat
’em bad!”
And at his other elbow' spoke a W'ell-oiled voice, with
pride.
“Bad, yes—lie,-he! 1 betcher’ll beat ’em next time,
too, me lad ! ”
Complacently the youngish bloke smoothed down his
glossy hair,
And sw’elled his chest up, rooster-like, as though
about to crow.
He kindled him a large cigar, of fragrance really
rare,
And stretched himself. “My word,” he beamed, “it
was a willing go!”
Just opposite a soldier sat, and, now’, his eyes
alight,
“Where was y’ fightin’, mate?” he asked. “Was
you at Lonesome Pine?
Or Bullecourt ?” He gripped the other’s knee and
held him tight.
“Or was y’ chasin’ Jacko with the boys in Pales-
tine?”
The bright, pert, youngish bloke let forth a short,
embarrassed bray,
And grinned a vacant grin as though he felt an
inward pang.
“What? Why—er—no. You see,” he said. “I’ve
just come back to-day
From helping Henry Hinks hold down his seat at
Bingenbang.”

From a Light Horse sport: ‘Just before
we left we had a sports meeting for the benefit
of a 2nd Regiment chap named Schooles. He won
seven events during the day. He led off by winning
a match against a Postle in disguise from the 3rd
Regiment for a purse of £2OO. He landed that
with eight yards to spare. Then he tore home first
in heats for the 75 yards, 100 yards championship
and 320 yards. While waiting for the finals to take
place he added the high jump (sft. 6in.), long jump
and hop-step-and-jump to his. tally. As the time
was now ripe for the finals in the flat races he
hopped in and bagged all three. To round off he
collected second money in the goal-kicking competi-
tion.” Now, where did this, bird Schooles spring
from, anvhow?

Australians are well up for the All-Round
Championship of America, which is decided on points
for wins and places obtained in all the important
events in the Union during the season. Goullett (112
points) and McNamara (76 points) are among the
first five wheelmen. They are both ahead of the
famous Kramer, who scored 46 points, and the
Canadian crack. Spencer, whose tally was only 34.
Another Australian, Grenda, is seventh on the list,
whilst Piercey, who won the Dunlop W arrnambool
to Melbourne Road Race in 1910, is fifteenth.

“Captain”: At a Fijian sports meeting I
saw one of the most original scraps possible. Two
Fiji bovs with a boxing reputation (and some of
the bovs can use ’em), one hailing from Baa. the
other from Nadi, were introduced to the audience,
which was made up of a dense throng of Fijians.

seethed. The attacked party promptly dispensea

bare-knuckle fight between two whites P t hfX e

the bar, a rough structure of timber roofed with

wreckage crawled the barman and his assistant, the
latter plaintively asking, “Who did that.
time things were sorted the planter had knocked out
the mate and the niggers had boxed themsehes t

When Sid Godfrey and Sandy McVea
undertook to be unpleasant to one another at Sydney
Stadium on Saturday it seemed reasonable to expect
that the abo. would keep Mr Godfrey "arm He
did ; but it was mainly through keeping
so husv punching him. It was a one-sided affair
from first to last, redeemed only by the
and endurance of the darky. He was pasted aH
round the ring, knocked through the ropes, smitten
on face, body and head, and he took the gruel with-
out flinching, sustained by the hope bemg abl
hand over a wallop that would turn the tide Two
or three times McVea seemed done to a turn, but
wouldn’t believe it. After 11 rounds Scott inter
vened and saved the hopelessly-beaten lad from
further punishment. McVea is wonderfully game and
a hard hitter, but was the underdog in every round.
* * *
The Godfrey-MeVea disturbance was to be
for the featherweight championship, but it wasn’t.
Godfrey w-as a pound over-weight—a circumstance
which 'changed the theoretical character of the com-
bat. In the light of what occurred this didn t mat-
ter. But something might have occurred which
would have made the 16oz. matter quite a lot. Sup-
posing McVea had won? Well, because Godfrey-
fought overw-eight he would still have been the
champ. It is clearly absurd that the holder of a
championship should be able to save his decoration
by offering himself in more meaty condition than the
regulations provide for. The objectionable feature of
this is that thereby a pug who suspects that the
championship may be annexed by- someone else may
five the other party no chance of winning. Somebody-
ought to see to it in view of a time when cham-
pionships may- be a bit more important than they- are
just now-. #
McGoorty, eminent pug a year or two
ago, has gone back to the U.S.A. He w-as a great
puncher in his time, but the hiding he got from
Darcy took most of the steam out of him, and
subsequent idleness and a severe surgical operation
for hernia took the rest. McGoorty s days of seri-
ous participation in bifl have gone. Yet he is only
27 —which is a couple of years younger than BoD
Fitzsimmons was when he entered the game.

“Cap” : Fast women and slow horses! The
Argus (4/12/’l7) discovered the limit as far as the
latter are concerned, any*how. Describing a race at
Richmond, the second division of a Tradesmen’s
Trot, the paper declared that the go was “won by
12 vards; Loafer, 15 years away, third. No run off.
The running of Sasanoff at Randwick in
the Spring made it look fairly certain that he
objected to having much cargo aboard. At Rosehill
(Sydney) on Saturday he explained that there w-as
something wrong about this idea by galloping over
the last part of a mile and a quarter with 9st. 51b.
It was in the December Handicap, a field of 19,
including Chantemerle, 9st. 21b., Cisco, 9st. 31b.,
Two Blues, Bst. 41b., and Marvano (who showed up
well in last Metropolitan), 6st. 71b. Sasanof had
a bad passage, and approaching the turn looked to be
a certain loser. But, taking an outside trip, he got
free at the bottom of the straight, and. putting in
a long, fast run, got his head in front of Chantemerle.
and earned a cheer for doing it. The gelding started
at 7 to 4, and Chantemerle, w-ho was as big as a
barrel, at 25 to 1. Now, in the Summer Cup Sasanof
is weighted at 9st. 31b.. Chantemerle at Bst. 131 b.
Sasanof may be favorite: but if Chantemerle’s leg
stands anv serious test in the meantime, 25’s may
not be going. Tw-o Blues was soundly backed on
Saturday at Rosehill. He had every chance, hut the
top-weights buried him half-way down the straight,
and half a dozen others passed the remains.
An ex performer among the ponies was
put over hurdles for the first time in public at Rose-
Gill on Saturday, and. in addition to giving Israel a
lift, clipped t o course record down for two miles,
"■citing over the ground and the fences in 3min.
47sec.- —which doesn’t make the timekeeper say-
much for the others.

Some likely starters in the Villiers’
Stakes, to be run next week over the Randwick
mile, drew attention to themselves at Rosehill
on Saturday. Sweet Com, Mehi King and Colugo
were starters in the Clyde Stakes, but not one of
them did anything to write home about. The
winner, Poitrina, who in the Spring of last year
was a flier among two-year-olds, is not in the
Villiers', but Some Boy. who ran her to a head, is.
So, too, are Promised Land, who won a division of
the Maiden, and Bridal March, winner of the Parra-
matta Mile. Bridal March carried Sst. 121 b. in
the Mile and won by two lengths in “42.” Weight
in the Villiers'. 6st. 13lb. Promised Land had 9st.
31b. and won his event easily, running the seven
furlongs in “271." With 6st. 121 b. in the Villiers’
he may notice a change. This is the imported prad
which dead-heated with Varico in the Granville
Stakes at Rosehill a month ago, but was deprived
of a place bv the stewards for boring.
* * * * *
Having secured through the “curtailment-
of-spoif’ je-t a right to assist in encouraging the
thoroughbred by holding meetings which clash with
Randwick, Sydney pony-course proprietaries are
laying themselves out to clash with a loud noise.
The public, instead of being limited to a dozen or
so pony flutters, is going to have the chance of
making an early start on merry-go-rounds pursuing
greasy pigs, watching foot-races, giving the kids a
swing and so on. This will endure all the morning,
with Ike presumably in attendance to do business
on what is going to occur later in the day. After
the "ames are over, the ponies will be produced and
sport be further curtailed by keeping them busy
till night arrives. There ought to be a heap of
dollars in it, anyway; for as a community generally
gets the kind of sport it hankers after, this cheap-
iack racing stunt ought to about fill the bill. That
it should be allowed is, of course, damnable. But
that is merely a detail incidental to the curtailment
of sport” by encouraging it for private profit.
Passed the post, tip-top sport James
George Brown, who presided at the weighbridge for
the Dubbo Jockey and Picnic Clubs for years, and
raced as “J. Chippie.” His brown-sleeved orange
blouse was familiar and often successful on N. is.
Wales country and metropolitan rinks; he included
amongst his oats-earners r lhe Jester, Torchy, Scally-
wag (winner of 1898 Challenge Stakes, Sydney) and
Strathrovale (bred by him), victor in the Newcastle
Cup, 1911. Off the course he was boss storekeeper
of Dubbo, where he bought out the late Julius Caro,
and later the Overland Stores, established in 1857
by William Anthony. After founding similar propo-
sitions at Narromine and Trangie, he wound upfe'
amalgamating, in 191 G, with Wise and Co., of Wei-
lington and Geurie; they formed the Western Stores
Ltd of which he was chairman. The well-known
Egelabra and The Weir stations, Warren district,
belonged to him also.
A country jockey named Hyland rode
five successive winners at Albury (N.S.W.) Charity
Meeting last week. Whereupon the crowd wheeled
up its money for Hyland’s mount in the last race.
Later on MacShortodds gathered up the accumu-
lated splosh and returned thanks to the other moke
which unexpectedly arrived by a nose.

“0.5. H.”: Of course racing is always
dinkum and jockeys never take a pull, but I wish
someone could tell me what a mannikin meant when
he walked his nag over to the rails and, leaning
over, gently whispered to the chap next to me, “Not
to-day.” As the brute he was on managed to arrive
about sixth, the information may possibly have been
that he was determined not to turn up last.
* * * *
“Spreader”: The Defence Department
made a good move when it purchased Marculfus for
breeding purposes. He’s a splendid-shaped horse,
with good timber, got by Positano, who has sired
the best lot of stayers we’ve had in Australia, all in.
Diploma, dam of Marculfus, threw at least one
champion in her time, and she’s well backed up with
the best blood in the stud-book. There are a few
other stallions of much the same calibre that could
be got at a fairly reasonable price at the present
time, and the Defence Department could do a lot
worse than snap them up.
“M.S.”: In his criticism of Pilot Stutt’s
performance in the record flight between Melbourne
and Sydney, “Snaffle” (B. 6/12/’l7) was not quite
fair in comparing the performance with that of
Cantain Laureati. The Italian was earned in a
300-h.p. F.I.A.T. machine. The ’plane used by
Stutt was only a 90-h.p. tuition ’bus used at the
N. S. Wales' aviation-school. With the kind of
machine used by Laureati from Turin to London
Australian aviators could easily make the inter-State
trip in from 31 to 4 hours. What we require is
a 300-h.p. Australian-made machine. The equipment
is everything in this business.
V •• # #
“Bouragi”: The Papuan not only uses
spider’s web for a landing net for fish, as a recent
Bulletin correspondent tells, but also for bait. The
Ferguson Islanders employ a kite to assist them in
their fishing. It is towed behind a canoe and the
bait (which is also the hook) is fastened to the
end of the “tail.” This flips along the top of the
water until a small fish which flourishes in that
neighborhood is induced to lay hold of the bunch
of web under the impression that it is kai (food).
As he possesses very hooked teeth it is a case of
mate, which is the Papuan equivalent of mafeesh.
The kite trick is also used by other Islanders, but
with them the bait is pearl-shell hook. This the
bonito mistakes for a flving-fish, with very uncom-
fortable results.
* * * *
“Wal”: Recently wandering through the
peaks of Central Papua I came upon a tribe fishing
in a broad, swift-running stream that rushed through
the middle of a lovely valley. The natives had con-
structed a wing-dam out to the centre of the tor-
rent, and had diverted the water from its usual bed
over a long, gravelly bar. All across the bar they
had made a filter of fallen trees and interlaced boughs
and wild banana leaves, so that the water could soak
through, but the fish had to remain behind. The
women and kiddies were dragging the old bed with
baskets made of plaited palm-leaves, formed like a
torpedo cut in two, the long streamline half-section
being the net into which the rushing water hurled
the fish. The catch was enormous. All sorts of
fins were being taken —big fellows like mountain
trout that scaled five to seven pounds apiece, long
eels with teeth like a buzz-saw, perch, a sort of
black bream, and any amount of delicious prawns.
Brown brother had a preserving works in full swing,
the catch being systematically gutted and dried bone-
hard over smoking fires of driftwood. This dried
food is kept for months in the villages; I have
sampled fish that had been thus preserved for most of
a year, and found it jolly good. Soaked for a few hours
and then boiled and served with white sauce, it is
hard to tell it from the best blue cod that ever swam
around the Ricketty Isles. For a person who is still
in the Stone Age, the Papuan mountaineer is a
brainy individual, and his work in turning this river
was as good as many a white engineer could perform,
considering that the only tools used were a few
sharp sticks and a stone axe or two.

A remarkable record has been established
by young Jack Hawkes, of Geelong College, in win-
ning the Public Schools’ '■Tennis Championship of
Victoria for the fourth time in succession. During
the four years in these matches he has not lost one
set. Though lacking the daring brilliance of Gerald
Patterson, the previous champion, he plays a fine free
game with powerful drives and accurate serving.
Patterson, by the way. has an M.C. now, and is in
the Royal Flying Corps. The Girls’ Championship
was won by Miss Outhwaite, who beat Miss Shuter,
daughter of Dr. (Major) Shuter, a leading r ,i av „ .
earlier days. The Major will be remembf r £l af*!!’

Last week was the anniversary of N T ed
Trickett'S death, and those who put their feet under
the table at a meeting of the memorial committee
in Sydney were Judge Backhouse, N. J MotWwm
(who with G. McGill, W. C. McDonald and Jack
Thompson, of the Mercs., won the “fours” in ’so
’9O, and ’9l), Q. L. Deloitte (who has been in the
amateur side since ’62), George Towns (one-time
world’s sculling champion), Harry Floyd (behind
many of the best professionals), Dick Coombes E
M. Betts and John Blackman. About £lOO is in
hand. The memorial will shortly be erected on
the Parramatta River.
Keith Kirkland’s big splash among the
free-style High Schools senior swimming champion-
ships at Sydney last week established his right to
be labelled the best boy swimmer for many years.
He won the 50yds. (26 4-ssec.), 100yds. (60see.)
220yds. (2min. 51sec.) and was second to Lyons in
the 440yds. and 880yds. Among the juniors,' Shand
scooped the pool (50yds., 100yds., 220yds. an( j
440yds.), and Degotardi did likewise in the Junior
Cadet Challenge Shield. Timekeepers going at
express rate during the afternoon reckoned that 15
records were broken and one equalled. It was the
boys’ busy day.

A mere springboard is not exciting
enough for them at Wangaratta (Vic.). At the bath-
ing-place on the King River they have a 30-foot
chain, with a cross-bar at the end, fastened to a
limb of a big red-gum growing out over the river.
You climb a 15ft. post, grab the cross-bar, swing
out well over the river, and then let go.
Jimmy Smith, the new Mayor of Sydney,
says he has been the architect of his own fortunes.
He is 60, and has been in Sydney half that time.
He has a seat in the Leg. Council —though Holman
and Heaven alone know what his qualifications are
for the job, and The Bulletin' is not going to
explain how he came to get it. Originally a steward
on the Union Co.’s steamers, Smith next kept a pub
in Wellington (M.L.), and then landed in Port Jack-
son. Peddling in-memoriam cards filled in a bit of
time at the start; then into the pub-business again,
with a pony-course as a sideline. The rest is a story
of accumulation, interspersed with judicious expendi-
ture.
Be sure your sin will find you out. A few
of Victoria’s Moderately-Rieh Landlords
made a set at Arthur Otto Sachse when the
House re-appointed him Chairman of Com-
mittees on account of bis painfully un-Brit-
ish name. Sachse himself was born here;
his father had come from Paris, whither he
had fled after fighting for his native Saxony
against Prussia. His mother was North of
Ireland. But it was remembered against
him that when Education Minister he wanted
to plant a German piano in every school in
the State, though Australian pianos were
obtainable ; and “Germany” was thus written
against his name in many muddled memories.
Billjim was in an expansive mood. He
still wore one arm in a sling, limped some-
what and bore a neat gash on one cheekbone
from eve to ear. But he beamed as he
talked. " “Figbt?” he said. “Plenty. Well,
look at me. I got this at th’ Landin, tnis
one at Messines. ’n’ these couple more just
before I left for ‘ome. It was orrignt!
The only fightin’ I was ever, in where th
cons didn’t interfere before it 'ardly begun.
DISILLUSIONED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I narked you saunter, graceful, through the sunlight
on the Block,
With your closely-fitting trappings, tailor-made from
newest stock ;
You were honey of the clover, you were fancy of the
flock
When you swung yourself through George-street in
the morning.
You thrilled me when you passed me and I swore
we should not stay
Strangers taking different pathways* twin souls
wandering astray.
You remember how I found you on that later
summer day?
It seemed the world was born again that morning.
Oh, sweetly-fashioned figure, clad in baby-blue and
w r hite,
With rounded bosom swelling ’neath the trembling
lace and light—
A later Venus fashioned for a newer world’s
delight—•
At least, 'twas so to me that summer morning.
But,, alas, life's disillusions! If the tailor makes
the man,
Who the dev ; l makes the woman? Answer that
whoever can !
Anyhow, by way of warning, here the credulous
should scan
What happened down at Manly Sunday morning.
Shooting beachward in a smother I got tangled with
some feet,
Which were grafted on a lady, and she toppled with
a bleat;
Presently she rose and faced me—-Lord, my heart
went cold as sleet —
’Twas my honey of the clover in the morning!
I steadied her upon her pins (hatpins they truly
were),
And I thanked the happy chances that had brought
the owner there
As a living affidavit that one 1 enus was a snare
I “found” for me, with costs, in court that morn-
ing!
She was flatter than a flounder and as skinny as
an eel.
She must have lost some packing when she shed her
outside peel!
As she grasped the situation she went up beach with
a squeal—■
Miss Onandoff made even-time that morning.
Wherefore should it happen in the recklessness of
life
That I feel impelled to ask a girl to be my wedded
wife,
I’ll avoid the disappointment that is keener than a
knife
By picking one at Manly in the morning.

There is a WAY to
Perfedt Health.
That way is open to you. Will you travel it?
The only way to improve Nature is through NATURAL
methods.
Drugs and apparatus usually show no results and are often
injurious. Under my method 15 minutes each day in your
own room is sufficient. I have thousands of students in all
parts of Australia and New Zealand who are now enjoying
good health. Previously a great number of these people
were sufferers from indigestion, constipation and other dis-
orders which are the direct result of the internal muscles
being much below normal.
My exercises pay particular attention to the muscles that
govern the action of the stomach, liver and bowels, and
quickly bring them back to a healthy state again.
Surely you want to enjoy the best of health ? Then why not
write to-day for full particulars of my
Postal Course of Health and Strength Culture?
This is proof of what I say:—
“Dear Sir, —I have practised the third set of exercises,
together with the other sets, and fed stronger than ever.
■ „,1 have increased 91b, in weight.
“Yours faithfully,
“Signed) H. F , Gemalla.”
Many hundreds of letters from pupils throughout Australia
and New Zealand are in the same strain.
I should like you to have my booklet, “HEALTH AND
STRENGTH FROM SELF CULTURE,” which tells about my
methods, fees, etc. Just write your name across this advt.
and send it to me, with three penny stamps for postage.

“Masetto”: The action of the Musicians’
Union in suspending members of alien
birth during the continuance of the war
makes one think of the luck some people
have. In 1804 a dozen German musicians
calling themselves “The Leipsiz Instrumen-
talists” toured Australia, and eventually
some of them settled here. Two. who had
become unionists, got notice to quit recently
from the orchestras they had played in for
years, but a third well-known performer
who left the union ranks a while back still
goes on with his job.
“Cherokee”: A Melbourne theatrical man-
ager’s comment on the death of General
Maude, the hero of Bagdad : “H’m —I see
Cyril Maude’s uncle is dead.” But sometimes
the soldier borrows from the boards. General
Sir Julian Byng, of the Third Army, who
has just driven home the latest punch on
the Hindenburg line, commanded the Canuck
Army Corps in France last year, with the
result that the Canadians christened them-
selves “The Byng Boys.” They have pro-
duced a parallel volume to Billjim’s Anzac
Book with this moniker.
“Melb”: Premier John Bowser, a Scotch
baby, was carried ashore in Australia at the
age of one. Ilis father was an old soldier,
and had blazed away in 13 Indian battles.
He settled in Bacchus Marsh. At 14 young
John was apprenticed to Crisp, of the
Bacchus Marsh Express. Inside 18 months
he transferred to a Melbourne printing office.
A sea voyage being recommended for his
sight, he went to Scotland, where his uncle
was connected with the Dumfries Standard.
Jack worked there as reporter and got
some instruction at Edinburgh University.
After six years he returned to Australia and
edited the Wangaratta Chronicle, with
which he has ever since been ' connected,
becoming ultimately sole proprietor. He
entered Parliament in ’94.
From one of the boys:—
A -s. Corlett, of Wandsworth, England, has won
the gia 'tude of more Australian soldiers than she
can couia on her fingers. Moved bj- the lamenta-
tions of a wounded Anzac over the mail he did not
get, Mrs. Corlett undertook to shake up the remiss
authorities, and as a result of her efforts a budget
of about 50 undelivered letters and packets dropped
on him. That gave the lady the idea that there
was an interesting branch of work to be tackled for
the sake of Australian soldiers; and she has been
busy at it ever since. The job has gr wn to large
proportions, but the kind-hearted matron reckons
that the gratification of making a soldier happy is
worth all the trouble.
The recent annual Federal show of the S.
Alts. Society of Arts may be the last for a
time. Adelaide has run the affair for 20
years, and by annual purchases has built up
a strong Australian Room in the State Art
Gallery. But the support from outside, and
especially from Sydney, is not what it should
be or what it used to be; and Adelaide has
got tired. Probably the capitals will take
the show in turns for the future —which in-
cidentally will give Adelaide painters the
chance which Adelaide alone has been giving
to the others.
Cressy, a little Western District village
in the Lake Corangamite region, houses no
less than three Victorian M’s.L.A. These
are Dave Oman, of the squatting brother-
hood, who sits for Hampden ; McDonald, of
Polwarth, who got the Parliamen ary job of
John Johnstone (resigned during the last
Parliament) ; and the new Farmers’ Union
man, David Gibson, who took the Grenville
seat abandoned by John Chatham. What
sort of village Cressy is may be judged by
the fact that only one solitary local voter,
at last month’s elections, was unfaithful to
Hampden’s old and crusted representative.
“Try Fluke”: Taranaki and Waikato
tanguta Maori will have nothing to do with
soldiering for service outside M.L., and all
the coaxings of Timi Kara (Jimmy Carroll)
and Dr. Poraare have failed to soften their
opposition. Other tribes have sent nearly
all their young fellows ; but the old bitter-
ness persists along the Waikato River and
around the Mountain. Now the Taranaki
people are quoting an old prophecy of Te
Whiti’s. “We cannot fight the whites,” he
told the faithful at Parihaka. “We are too
few and weak. But there will come a day
when the white people’s homes shall be
filled with widows and orphans; then shall
we be avenged.” The prophet’s prediction, in
part, is in a fair way to fulfilment. Con-
scription should, of course, rake in all the
recalcitrants; but the M.L. Government still
hesitates to apply it to John Maori.
“303” has another shot:—
It’s no good arguing with “Nimrod” (B. 8/11/’l7)
over the invention of the magazine rifle, but I main-
tain, on mam- undoubted authorities, that it was first
used in war in the American Civil commotion in
1861, three years before the Hun attacked Denmark,
though the Geri an used the needle-gun to settle a
few internal scraps many years before that. In ’6l
a regiment, by rapidity of fire from magazine-rifles,
beat off an attack when outnumbered by three to
one. “Nimrod” says that the mag. rifle was “an
experiment.” So it was. So was the monitor, yet
the very latest “Hush, hush!” cruiser is only an
improved monitor. It cannot be proved who invented
breech-loading firearms. In addition to his eight
wives, Henry VIII. had two breech-loaders, which
“Nimrod” may see in the Tower of London. They are
of excellent workmanship, the breech arrangement
closely resembling the Snider or French tabatiere.
The date is 1537. “Nimrod” asks what smokeless
powder was in use in 1866. The Schultz, used in
England in 1864, and still made and sold by a
British co. As with breech-loading rifles, many
men were at work on the smokeless-powder problem
at different times. First evidence of a nitrated
organic substance- being used as a propellent is
dated 1534. Sehonbein, the Austrian, made his
cotton powder in 1846. When the French did
adopt “smokeless” the priming of black powder
made s 6 much smoke that concealment was impos-
sible. Ultimately Hiram Maxim set them right;
and he credits Lord Wolselev with the suggestion of
“smokeless” for his machine-gun cartridges. In the
great cordite case, Sir Richard Webster, represent-
ing the British Government, repeatedly said that
“Hiram Maxim was the first to combine nitro-
glycerine and true gun-cotton in a smokeless-
powder.” This was the decision of the Court that
defeated Nobel. Hiram himself gives credit to the
Austrian chemist for being the first man to make a
stable gun-cotton (1846).

REPORT.
The Directors submit to the Proprietors the Balance-sheet as at' 16th April last, with the Profit
Account for the half-year to that date. After providing for rebate on bills current, for British and
Australasian rates and taxes, and for a Bonus to the Staff, and after making provision for bad and

total of £327,868/13/4, out of which the Directors have declared a Dividend for the half-vear at the
rate of 14 per cent, per annum, or £2/16/- per share, and a bonus at the rate of 3 per cent.'per annum
or 12/- per share, together £3/8/- per share, free of income tax.

to the Reserve Fund. There will then remain £122,868/13/4 to be carried forward to the next account
The Dividend and Bonus will be payable, in London and in Australasia, on the sth October.
The Directors record with regret the resignation of their colleague, Sir E. Montagu Nelson, K.C M G
who had been a valued member of the Court of Directors since 1891.
To fill the vacancy thus created, the Directors have appointed Mr. Harold Nelson whose name will
be submitted for the approval of the Proprietors at the Annual General Meeting in 1918, in accordance
with the provisions of the Deed of Settlement.

F. H. BLOGG, Accountant. R. W. JEANS, General Manager.
We have examined the cash and securities in London, and the London books, and have verified the
transfers from the several branches in the Commonwealth and New Zealand, and we beg to report that,
in our opinion, the foregoing is a full and fair balance-sheet of the Bank, and that it exhibits a true
and correct view of the state of the Bank's affairs as shown by the books. The investments were valued
at market price or under.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character ) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped-
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
W. E. Bottrill: Thanks, but can’t print
the verses. Try the Sunday papers; they might be
glad to have the translation. Returning copy
Jno. Cody: The Defence Dept, might tell you
Lab Totok: Rather! And paint it with local color
wherever possible... .Murkah: But you don t ex-
plain why one was substituted for the other....
A.E.8.: Don’t know how many eggs wild turkey,
brush turkey and mallee hen lay per year; but wait
a bit and you’ll hear a terrible clamor... .8.A.J..
It isn’t our style.... Pepper-box: Nothing in that
flea’s observations.... Can Teen: No use to u 5....
Elliven: Not enough meat in it... .X.Y.Z.: No, the
yarn is too crude. .. .A.J.G.: Neither up....J.H.:
Rough verse and lumpy thinking... .T.R.: Dreary
stuff No Name: “Parasite” doesn’t get hold of
us....Buyar: Yes, we’re at war. At least there was
a rumor to that effect even before you spent six lines
of rhyme to say it....D.T.: We don’t reply bv post.
The yarn is mere weariness... .W.H.D.: This is
about the fiftieth time the Kaiser has been denied
admission to Hell, and every time it happens in
worse verse....G.J.: With a little more care in con-
struction “Love” would have done....Fernleaf: You 11
have to take pains and put in real work.... A.P.K.:
The cold yarns don’t move u 5.... H.F.: Not up by
leagues J.G.: No use A.T.E.: Graphic enough;
but why didn’t you honestly drown the girl ? « She
seems to have deserved it... .F.H.P.: Poor verse,
with lumps in it, but no grip... .Vagabond:
“Slackers in the Bush” is rough stuff limping along
to nowhere in particular. .. .11. T.: “Single and Fit”
hasn’t a punch.... J.E.C.: Verses not up....F.8.:
Feeble. .. -H.S.: It fades off into delightful obscurity:
Though ages pale, still lives the tale,
Of the boys of the kangaroo.
’Twas for Freedom’s kit their empires knit,
And we were in that —me and you.
.... G.H.G.M.: Lacks workmanship.... Consoof:
Ancient gag. . . .P.A.: Doesn’t work.... J.M.S.:
Nothing. . . .IT.A.S.: Not a glimmer in those “Lights”
. ...A.S.M.: The Major is too thin. ~ .W.R.H.: Stiff
verse with no special merit. Write about something
you really know. Everybody knows something
specially well: and that’s the thing we want to get.
G.D.: N 0... .M.W.L.R.: “Cobbler” doesn’t
strike U5....R.P.: Pretty crude stuff... .G.R.H.:
Neither will d 0... .C.H.H.: Looks like a telegram
gone insane... . A.W.: Lamentable verse entitled “A
Poet’s Protest”, hurled forth.... H.G.F.: We couldn’t
use the “Judgment”... .C.D.: Well-intentioned verse,
but a long way below standard... .W.G.8.: Too
slight .R.S.Jr.: “Perfida” can’t either “lisp” or
“go to pot” here... .W.M.8.: Wants more vigor in
the telling... .F.E.: Not up... .E.W.D.: “Dawn” is
really pretty awful... .O.B.: The scene is very vivid:
Trouble arose to know how they were going to quit,
To move their furniture, which was so hard to get;
There was only one way—to have a moonlight flit;
For all the neighbors knew, we w T ere getting well set.
So one moonlight night, with chattels and tent, we
went
To a piece of land which Jack w r as going to rent;
For,nobody knew which way we were bent,
And nobody troubled us to collect a scent.
... .G.J.M.: No ; you must get more freedom and not
eke out your verses with print-worn phrases....
E. : The love may be in tune, but the verse isn’t.
. ...A.8.C.: “Anzae” no use. More force, more
skill and more pains needed. The thing that is just
dashed off is nearly always just dashed awful....
F. : “Summer’s Day” too bumpy and uncomfort-
able... .G.C.S.: Not up E.J.McC.: Not nearly
up....R.5.: An idea in “Petrol,” but your verse is
too vile.... Sam Snipe: Heaven mend your sense of
humor!... .G.K.: Too rich in worn phrases. The
idea has already been better worked a dozen times.
T.M.W.: Too thin.... Tim Tattle: There’s no
smile in that.... White Cat: “Bayain” has no snap
in it.... Oswald Ignatius: Blank verse must be very
good to pass; yours is very middling... .M.C.H.:
Tried to read the spidery scrawl, but couldn’t make
out whether it was a prayer, a telegram or adver-
tisement copy.... Recklaw: It’s pretty rotten....
Vixen: You can’t rhyme “wisp” with “mist” nor
“lurk” with “works”... .L.M.: Verse and grammar
are all at sea.... Mari Marina: Not bad verse; but
find something to write about. Mere repetitions and
musical arrangements of words are nothing unless
they carry a little thought... .V.T.: You went after
a runaway child and found it wasn’t a runaway child
but another child called Smith. What’s all the fuss
about ?... .M.S.: The verses miss, but they have
merit. Try something that grips The Blade:
“Harpy” is a bit too long and rambling. We couldn’t
have a woman dying over half a page.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
M.C.: We don’t like the small, flat boy with a
knife in his hand. ~ .L.M.S.: Microscopic jest....
L.E.: Can do nothing but send it home L.C.C.:
There’s a certain tame wildness about it C.H.H.:
N0....805ey: Not up....Ferg: Sorry can’t answer
your questions. The war has sent the professional
prophets out of business.
The Papuan Government, looking around
for revenue, has passed a bill to institute a
tax upon brown brother. Under it every
ablebodied native will have to contribute
five or 10 shillings towards the cost of Law
and Order. Failure means imprisonment up
to six moons. Payment in kind is allowed
for, so the production of rubber and copra
should receive an impetus. If the abo. has
not a cocoanut-grove or rubber-preserve to
draw on, he will be handed a shovel and
sooled on to road-making. With proper
administration this head tax should be a
factor in the development of the coun-
try. But the good to the savage himself will
be still greater, and within a decade or so he
may become a useful citizen.
“E.W.” : There ought to be some work for the
new German rain-gauge which “Geo Logist”
saw set up on the East-West line at Wyn-
bring (S.A.), for Balsillie’s rain-making
apparatus is now set up out there. Unless
his kites fetch it down the fall will doubtless
be much the same as it has always been
round those parts—anything less than 10
inches a year. The handiest place for which
there seem to be any records worth speaking
about is Arcoona station, about 200 miles
nearer Port Augusta, and there the average
for 29 years has been between six and seven
inches. Yet Arcoona is reckoned very decent
sheep-country as things go in the west and
nor’-west of South Aus. The distribution of
rain matters more than the quantity. One
year they did very well, on a couple of inches
between shearing and shearing.

DON’T WORRY.
Anxiety and worry have most harmful
effects upon the nervous system. Overwork
also causes a man to become nervous and
inclined to worry. This feeble state of the
nervous system often ends in what the
doctors call neurasthenia —which is nervous
exhaustion. If you cannot devote your
mind fully to business or work ; if you are
not sure of yourself; feel excitable "and de-
pressed ; take heed. You will find sleep does
not rest you, your memory will play tricks,
your limbs ache and tremble after any walk
or exertion, and there will be a dull pain in
your back.
You must take prompt steps to stop this
progressive mischief that may develop into
neurasthenia; you must nourish your
nerves with the one food they need—rich
new blood. Nothing so surely renews the
supply of strong red blood as Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills, and this is the reason they are
so valuable in nervous diseases of both
sexes. Even children benefit from the use

AT POVERTY POINT.
When Allen Doone was preparing for his
first appearance on Broadway, the ’Murkan
citizen gasped to find this advt. in his news-
papers :
AUSTRALIAN ACTORS WANTED FOR “LUCKY
O’SHEA.”
None but Australians need apply.
Applicants must produce birth certificate.
Apply to the Australian Star,
ALLEN DOONE, 39th Street Theatre, Broadway.

across in time for opening in New York
owing to delayed passports, and as the com-
pany was billed as an Australian one the call
was made to Australians on the Great White
Way. The cry was practically in tor
only one or two were unearthed.
Keeley and Maurice Lynch were in their old
parts, and the show was much on a par with
the Australian production. Practically all
the New York critics, however, frowned at
the play. They rejoiced at its “artlessness
but laughed at its “out-of-date style.”
“Baldy”: The practice mentioned by
“Penden” (B. 29/11/’l7) is a very old one.
The reserved stall which becomes unreserved
on payment of an extra bob to the usher has
for many years been available at Melbourne
theatres. Here and there, this sort of seat
can be opened up at the theatre box-office at
the bob-extra rate, but then you have to
give the usher his sixpenny-tip as well. lor
highly-boomed shows, when one wants to
make an absolute cert, of taking Flora to
the first performance, and can’t bothered
waiting on the doorstep at plan's in the
early morning and fiddling with numbered
coupons, the correct thing is to stroll around
about 9 g.m. on Monday and spot an usher
in mufti, one or two of whom are usually to
be found hovering on the outskirts of
the mob. He will be glad, not to say eager,
to sell you a pair of stalls at a premium of
2s. 6d. each. But the surest way to bag a
couple of seats is to take Amy to dinner at a
big hotel and get the waiter to book them
over the ’phone for you out of the pub’s
reservation. Payment for the service goes
into his tip, and you don’t have to give the
usher more than the sprat aforesaid for
showing you to your seat and providing a
programme. Of course Belle’s dinner is
rather an expense, but you can’t expect to
get it going and coming these days.
“H. 0.”: Whence the convention that
Hamlet should be a slim, good-looking Dane?
He pleads guilty to the possession of “too
solid flesh,” and'gives us to understand that
bearing a few fardels caused him to “grunt
and sweat.” Ophelia, too, asseverates that
when the Prince chap was making love to
her he gave a sigh that seemed “to shatter
all his bulk.” In the graveyard scene, when
Hamlet estimates
that he loved
Ophelia more than
40,000 brothers, he
skites of his will-
ingness to fast, by
way of proving
these statistics, as
if fasting were the
most painful ordeal
he could think of.
Finally, when the
young man has
been killed, Fortin-
bras, having ap-
parently made a
rough estimate of
the corpse’s weight,
directs: “Let four
captains bear Ham-
let,” which would
have been sheer
waste of captain

resented. It seems to me that the only
mummer at present in Australia who is
physically suited to the part of the Dane is
Bob Greig.
Irma Caron speaks frankly :
The East Melbourne Conservatorium is pushing its
pupils well into the limelight these times. The
other night, at the Tivoli, four girls styled The
Madame Melba Quartette warbled very nicely, and
were far more acceptable than many imported turns
presented at the same house. Their singing teachers
have done very well from a vocal standpoint, but
have missed the ’bus in every other direction, over-
looking stage deportment, the manner in which the
girls acknowledge applause, the position of the feet
when standing, and personal appearance generally.
Somehow or other, the Australian singjer, profes-
sional or amateur, pays too little attention to the
details which English and Continental audiences
demand as their right, and which tell everywhere.
In America stage presence is considered half the
battle, and it is just there that most of the great
singers score over our Melba. A popular and charm-
ing French singer once remarked, in passing judg-
ment on a fine tenor singer hereabouts: “Hie is
really a business man with a voice. God often puts
voices in the wrong bodies.”
Ted Tait, who has been combing America
for Australian attractions, i-ounded up
Harry Lauder in a Broadway theatre and
found the Scotchman still drawing the town.
Lauder is now an American institution, and
showed his popularity by selling half a
million worth of War Bonds for Uncle Wil-
son in Wall-street the other day. Charles
Tait. who is also in America, has been
steadily stalking celebrities with a fountain-
pen. He went to University City, the centre
of the movie industry, and was allowed to
hold a small white hand that lifts $15,000 a
week from a big film firm. The hand belongs
to Mae Marsh, one of the most popular in-
habitants of Australian screens. Charles
Tait also went to hear evangelist Billy
Sunday, who talks to the Almighty like an
old friend. Sunday yawps crude religion in
a strange mixture of George Ade and homely
Yankee, and invariably has the bulk of his
audience surging with emotion —a travelling
hospital is kept handy for the treatment of
hysterical men and women who are over-
come by his eloquence. His audiences range
from 10,000 upwards.
“J.F.H.”: After a long absence from the
London stage playwright Henry Arthur
Jones has weighed in at the St. James’s with
what he calls “a parable in a farce,” entitled
“The Pacifists.” General verdict: Crude,
wearisome and wholly unsatisfactory. The
neatest comment is that of Walkley in the
Times: “Two stools, you see, and no one
need be surprised
at the proverbial
result.” The story
is that of the des-
potic mayor of
Market Pewbury,
who commits all
sorts of vexatious
tyrannies until
some aggravated
ratepayer has the
happy thought of
importing into the
place a professional
pugilist who chucks
his dicta to rial Wor-
ship into the canal
amid the cheers of
the populace. Ap-
parently this local
mayor—a butcher
by trade —is in-
tended to typify in
some obscure way
the autocratic
Kaiser; but Jones
utterly fails to
establish the con-
nection. The first-

night audience laughed a good deal at the
comical situations, but was never once im-
pressed by the parable. The show was taken
off after 10 performances.
Ivy Shilling, appearing in the Empire
revue, “Topsy Turvy,” was given two pages
of photographs in a recent London Sketch.
Ivy’s working partner appears in one pic-
ture and is described as “Fred A. Leslie, the
well-known American dancer.” Some of
the music for this show —including the big-
gest song hit, “In a Jungle”—was written by
Howard Carr, who used to twirl a baton in
these parts and married Trixie Tracy, then
one of The Bulletin’s Melbourne chat-
terers.
“8.J.”: Once again kind arts have won
a coronet for a London Gaiety girl, the
winner being Irene Richards, lately appear-
ing in “Theodore and C 0.,” and the prize,
Viscount Drumlanrig, son and heir of the
Markiss of Queensberry. The list of
marriages between blood and paint starts
with the Duke of Bolton and Polly
Peaehum, who eloped in 1728. Then
Catherine Stephens became Countess of
Essex; Mary Bolton. Baroness Thurlow;
Anastasia Robinson, a favorite in George
Srd’s time, Countess of Peterborough:
Louisa Brunton, Countess of Craven; and
Harriet Mellon secured old Coutts and his
money and died Duchess of St. Albans. The
late Dook of Cambridge, when a knut,
married Louisa Fairbrother. In more recent
times stage ladies who have chanced it have
included Belle Bilton (Clancarty), Connie
Gilchrist (Orkney), Lidiana Maichle
(Haldon), Rose Boote (Headfort), Anna
Robinson (Rosslyn). Eva Carrington (De
Clifford) and Frances Donnelly (Ashbur-
ton). Camille Clifford secured the eldest
son of Lord Aberdare; but the young mao
was killed in France and his widow re-
married the other day. Denise Orme became
Lady Churston; and Sylvia Storey, Lady
Poulett. Zena Dare paired with the Hon.
Maurice Brett, second son of Lord Esher.
Mostly things have turned out all right: but
May Yohe had to get rid of her little lot.

"Theorbo”: Bendigo’s beautiful white
Cathedral of the Sacred Heart is jocularly
called St. Backhaus’s. Dean Backhaus left
£120,000 to the church from his mining
specs., and this financed the building. Yet
his affection was more with St. Lilian's,
from which the Castles sisters blossomed.

DRUM AND CYMBALS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, bust this dull and doleful world where men sit
crouched with pens,
And earn their bread and pots of tea in dark and
mouldy dens!
Confound the saintly suburbs and the little lawns we
mow,
The long black Sunday coats we wear, the long white
bills we owe!
To Hades with the cost of fish and Parliament and
law,
And all the other things at which men wag a
foolish jaw!
I’m sick of all familiar things! In sunshine I would
tread,
And, marching, beat a big bass drum to wake the
living dead.
I want to hear the bass drum’s boom, the cymbals’
clash and cling,
And yell at those suburbanites who stare like
anything!
Scared faces over hedges green will watch me as I
pass,
And some of them will mutter “Shame!” while
others whisper “Ass!”
But, hatless, I will proudly tramp the middle of the
road
And swing the drumstick merrily and thrash my
swinging load.
With noisy bursts of drunken song I’ll cheer my
lonely way
And make my thunder as I go. 800m — bash!
Cling-clash! Hooray!!
All this is what I long to do. But, rain is ev’ry
hope,
I’m handcuffed by Convention and I’m bound by
Custom's rope.
The turtle cannot leave his shell, no more can I
leave mine;
So, with the drab suburban crowd, of high-priced fish
I whine.
I mow the lawn, I trim the hedge, I walk on sober
feet,
And I would die of craven shame if I’d a drum to
beat.
My neighbors I would never shock with vulgar
noise and loud,
Or do a blessed thing to draw a scared and wond'ring
crowd.
But down the jolly roads of Dream with buoyant
step I tread,
And howl and bash a big red drum to >vake the
living dead!

Simple and Effective Methods.

Grey Hair—Home Remedy.
There are plenty of reasons why grey hair
is not desirable, and plenty of reasons why
hair dyes should not be used. But, on the
other hand, there is no reason why you should
have grey hair if you do not want it. To turn
the hair back to a natural color is really a
very simple matter. One has only to get from
the chemist two ounces of concentrate of tam-
malite and mix it with three ounces of bay
rum. Apply to the hair with a small sponge
for a few nights and the greyness will gradu-
ally disappear. This liquid -is not sticky or
greasy, and does not injure the hair in "any
way. It has been used for generations with
most satisfactory results by those who have
known the formula.
Blackheads Fly Away.
A practically instantaneous remedy for
blackheads, greasy skins and enlarged 'pores,
recently discovered, is now coming into gen-
eral use in the boudoir. It is very simple,
harmless and pleasant. Drop a stymol tablet
obtained at the chemist’s, in a tumbler full of
hot water. After the effervescence has sub-
sided bathe the face in the liquid, using a
Small sponge or soft cloth. In a few minutes
dry the face and the offensive blackheads will
come right off on the towel. Also the large
oily pores immediately close up and efface
themselves naturally. The greasiness dis-
appears and the skin is left smooth, soft and
cool. This simple treatment is then repeated
a few times at intervals of four or five days
to ensure the permanence of the result.
Emergency Complexions.
Even a complexion which is hopelessly dull
or greasy can be made beautiful in a moment
by a perfectly harmless home recipe. If you
have no cleminite in the house, get about an
ounce from your chemist, and add only
enough water to dissolve it. The process de-
fies detection, and the result is an immediate
appearance of velvety, youthful “bloom”
which every woman desires. The effect will
last all day under the most trying conditions,
indoors or out. and renders powdering quite
unnecessary. This simple substance is also
very good for the skin, and no possible harm
can come from its regular use.
Effectually Killing Superfluous Hair.
Many women know how to remove ugly
growths of superfluous hair temporarily, but
few know how to remove it permanently. For
this purpose pure powdered plieminol may be
usexl. Get about an ounce from your chemist
and apply a little directly to the objection-
able hair. The purpose of the recommended
treatment is not merely to remove the super-
fluous hair instantly, but also to kill the hair
roots completely in a comparatively short
time.
How Nature Makes New Complexions.
It is well known that the human skin is
constantly undergoing a tearing down and
building up process. With advancing years or
waning vitality this tissue-change lags: the
lifeless, soiled surface skin stays on so long
that its owner gets a “poor complexion.”
Commonsense tells us this dead skin cannot
be enlivened or beautified by any cosmetic,
lotion or powder. The natural thing to do is
to actually remove the offensive skin—remove
the bad complexion It has been found that
ordinary mercolized wax completely absorbs
the devitalised skin., in minute particles, so
gently, gradually, as to cause no inconveni-
ence. Mercolized wax, which any chemist can
supply, is put on at night like cold cream,
and washed off in the morning. If you would
have a brilliantly beautiful and youthful com-
plexion, just use this simple treatment.
How to Have Thick and Pretty Hair.
Soaps and artificial shampoos ruin many
beautiful heads of hair. Few people know
that, a teaspoonful of good stallax dissolved
in a cup of hot water has a natural affinity
for the hair and makes the most delightful
shampoo imaginable. It leaves the hair bril-
liant, soft and wavy, cleanses the scalp com-
pletely, and greatly stimulates the hair-
growth. The only drawback is that stallax
seems rather expensive. It comes to the
chemist only in sealed quarter-pound pack-
ages, which retail at about four shillings
However, as this is sufficient for 25 or 30
shampoos, it really works out very cheaply
in the end. r'4

To suffer with fortitude is
heroic, but to suffer needlessly
is idiotic. While most sufferers
regard pain as due to the
dispensation of Providence,
doctors see in it a certain
neglect—the neglect of simple
rules of health.
all rheumatic afflictions acute lumbago is the
most painful. It arises from a gradual accumu-
lation of excess uric acid in the system ; the muscles of
the lower back become impregnated until the muscu-
lar fibres stiffen and fcvery movement causes agony.
The simple habit of taking Kruschen Salts every
morning cleanses the system of excess uric acid, braces
the nerves and gives to the user the daily enjoyment
of natural vigorous health. Get the Kruschen habit.

Depot Creek, in the Flinders Range, from
which the Commonwealth gets the water for
its Port Augusta railway works, has an in-
teresting bit of history. It was so named
because E. J. Evre made a deoot on its banks
when he was exploring the country to the
north of Spencer Gulf in 1840. It was
Eyre who in 1841 pioneered the transcon-
tinental route by making the first overland
journey from South Aus. to Westralia.
The youngest daughter of Lady Char-
lotte Bacon, immortalised as lanthe by
Lord Byron, lives at Walkerville, near
Adelaide, and tiiis daughter’s son, Harry
D. Young, is a member of the S. Aus. Par-
liament. Lady Charlotte was the third
daughter of the Earl of Oxford and Morti-
mer, and her husband, who afterwards
became General Bacon, fought under
Wellington at Waterloo.
Long before he became Chief Justice and
Uni. Chancellor, George Murray founded
at Adelaide Uni. the Tinline scholarship in
memory of the family of his mother. Tne
Tinline scholar has to prepare an original
thesis on some subject of Imperial or
Colonial history. Wilfrid Oldham, 8.A., the
scholar for 1914-10, has written an interest-
ing thesis on S. Aus. land policy from 1830
to 1842.
That the Chicago beef baron can be a
benevolent old Father Christmas was ex-
plained without going into much detail the
other day in Maoriland, The Meat Export
Trade Committee appointed by the House
of Reps, called upon one Carney to explain
himself. It transpired that Carney is a
director of Armour and Co. of Australasia,
Ltd. This co., which carries on business in
M.L., has a registered capital of £20.000,
but employs £250,000. "Where does that
money come from?” asked someone. "Oh.
it is advanced to us by a bank,” explained
Carney, and being invited to further con-
fidences he intimated that the advances were
made on the personal guarantee of J. Ogden
Armour, of Chicago. Whereupon :
Has this J. Armour nothing to do with the firm
of Armour and Co., Chicago?—Certainly he
He is president.
What has your co. to do with Armour and C'o., of
Chicago ? —Nothing.
Is this man a philanthropist who guarantees over-
drafts?—He may be.
Why does he give you this credit? —We carry on
business in his name, nuking money for him.
Then he must be connected with the firm of
Armour and Co. of Australasia?—Not at all.
At about this stage the Committee felt itself
getting tiid up in 15 knots and adjourned to
look for the other end of the string.
It is not national organisation on grand
lings we want so much as a little practical
eommonsense in our present Redtape busi-
nesses. Take the mining industry, for in-
stance, in X. 8. Wales. Consolidation and
modernisation of our laws having been pro-
mised only about 20 years, no one can
reasonably expect to see many of the weird
relics of the diggings-days removed from the
Statute books this century ; but some of the
comic-opera Warden’s Court business might
be cut out without seriously reflecting on
the memory of our grandparents. If it is
still proper for the holder of a little miner’s
right tenement of a quarter-acre to be
obliged to apply to the Warden for permis-
sion to temporarily reside elsewhere before
he can safely go shearing—though Queens-
land long ago decided that it was unneces-
sary—could not the mighty business be fixed
up by post, so that if the State’s first duty
to ancient fossickers, etc., is to extract
revenue from them, the revenue will not be
about 100 times offset by the expense of a
highly-paid official’s journey to a distant
centre to hold a superfluous court? There
are cases where Wardens’ Courts are neces-
sary, but most of them are held at large
expense for the purpose of dealing with
trivialities that really don’t matter, and
certainly only yield a fraction in fees of the
cost of hokling court. It used to be the
same with Land Boards; but two-thirds of
the tinkering little applications they for-
merly fumbled with are now fixed up at
one-tenth the cost in time and money in the
Lands offices. For most of which, by the
way, N. S. Wales should have thanked the
late Paddy Crick.
A mayor who has done more for his coun-
try than most is R. H. S. Abbott, who wears
the rabbitskins at Bendigo. He has three
sons on various Fronts, including Captain
W. Abbott, M.C.. of the M.L. Army
Medical Corps. The Captain left his Otago
practice in 1914, and, except for three
months in hospital in London, has been close
to the fighting line ever since. In Gallipoli
he was shot through clothes and haversack;
he carried a rifle himself in the charge that
won Chunuk Bair for the Gurkhas and
Maorilanders; and he was in at the capture
of Courcelette.
"Costs”: The war has produced at least
one judgment that deserves immortality—
that of the German court which decided that
a bullet which wounds a soldier is the pro-
perty of the State, so the soldier has no legal
right to it as a memento. The Hun air-
raids on London have called up several
knotty problems. Many Londoners having
had their roofs covered with steel-netting
from which a bomb bounces before it ex-
plodes, the Law Journal advises that it
is illegal to pass on the visitor to the person
next door. The case is quoted of a S’Afriean
farmer who kept away locusts by lighting
fires on the edge of his property, driving
the pest back on to neighboring farms. The
decision in this case was that an occupier
of land must abate a nuisance on his land at
his own peril and cannot turn it on to a bit
of the world that belongs to someone else •
but he can take steps to prevent a nuisance
entering his property, even though in doing
so he may turn it on to others. This seems
to favor the man with the bomb-proof net-
ting. but he is uppercut by the common law
doctrine that the owner of land owns all
above his bit of soil in the same vertical
plane, including, presumably, the starry
heavens and anything that may be beyond
so that a missile dropped from the sky is
actually on his property long before it
leaches his roof, wherefore he must “abate
the nuisance at his own peril.” In the cir-
cumstances his only remedy would seem to
be to prosecute the Huns for trespass.


STOPAIN
A BOON TO MOTHERS.
After much thought and experiment
we have at last succeeded in completing
what we believe is the most successful
treatment known for toothache. We
have placed it on the market under the
name of
STOPAIN
A Toothache Gum.
Besides being the latest and most
successful treatment for toothache,
Stopain is both simple and economical’,
It is in the form of a gum and all you
have to do is to fill the cavity of the
tooth with it. It excludes the air and
stops toothache immediately.
No more burnt gums or blistered
tongues by liquid “cures” and this
alone means a lot to mothers.
Not only does Stopain relieve the pain,
but it also assists to preserve the tooth
until dental aid can be obtained, thus
making it invaluable to families in the
country who are often a day’s journey
from the nearest dentist.
Stopain is a boon to mothers. No
home should be without Stopain ; it is so
convenient and never fails to bring relief.
Stopain has been tried by thousands of
people and we have never yet known it
to fail when used according to directions.
Get it now for you never know when it
may be needed.
Stopain is sold by most retailers at Is.
per box, but if yours hasn’t got it in
stock it will be sent, to any address
postage paid, upon receipt of price by
SUNSET DRUG CO.,
Cr. Goodlet & Riley Streets, Sydney.

Oh! My! Corn-pains in every nerve!
It will dumbfound you, especially if
you have tried everything else for corns---
applied in two seconds, and if it does
not cure your corns we will refund your
money.
If you have ever made a fat bundle of
your toes with bandages ; used thick,
corn pressing rings ; corn pulling salves
or liquid medicines that took off more
toe than corn—well, you will appreciate

The Limit in Fine Car
VALUE
The Australasian price of the Mitchell is lower than any car costing the same in America.
When you consider that the Mitchell six-cylinder
undersells any other car of its class m America
its extraordinary value is apparent. . In the
first six months of this year sales increased
160 per cent.
The Mitchell embodies 31 features which nearly
all other cars omit. It is built to the standard of
100 per cent, overstrength —which is twice the
usual margin of safety, whilst it vastly excels
most rival cars in luxury and beauty.
Before buying your new car
inspect the Mitchell and let it be your choice.

SHOES are exquisitely cool and light in the
hottest weather, yet none of your dowdy,
canvas shoes either but smart, elegant, in
the fore-front of fashion. Most Australian
women will have sighed for such shoes, and here
they are in the latest shipment of Bostocks. The
model illustrated is delightful even in picture
form. But think of it in reality, a light, grace-
ful shoe of finest moire, built in that new, short-
fronted shape so thoroughly French, and made
with a dainty Louis heel. If ever there was
an ideal shoe for smart wear in hot weather, it
is certainly this one. Then for other tastes,
there are other shoes equally charming in this
Bostock selection. The shoes are unmistakable,
and have the name Bostock stamped on the soles.

The Inky Way.
“J.P.”: Died at Christchurch (M.L.), at
34, Herbert E. Boon, one of the brightest of
the younger journalists in Loan Land. While
at Auckland he produced regularly the best
police-court column that ever caused a smile
in the land. Four years ago the late Gresley
Lukin grabbed him for Wellington Post,
where he did a lot of good work, especially
from the Parliamentary Gallery. He had a
bent for fiction, and some years ago, in collab-
oration with John Patrick, wrote several
fine short stories that were published in top-
notch magazines in U.S.A. One of the best
was “The Outcast,” which appeared in the
Chicago Red Book for August, 1906.

“D.F.” welcomes back an old friend :
Modestly described as “priceless,” the 100th num-
ber of that journalistic curiosity, the King Island
Record, made its appearance the other day. It
gives some of the history of the troubled little sheet,
every number of which has been written from title
to footnote, printed, or rather struck off, on a copy-
ing-machine, and published by the editor, T. A.
Stephenson. It was first brought out at King Island
on September 13, 1905, and for some time thereafter
every fortnight. Stephenson’s views on land-
dummying brought him into collision with a few of
the islanders and with the then Minister of Lands in
the Speck, Alec Hean, whom he mildly describes as
an “ignorant and very unworthy person.” For three
years the journal was suspended while the editor
peeled apples in a drying-factory and attended to
other jobs. In 1910 he started his journal again as
a weekly, but, he says, “after bringing out my paper
for some weeks on bread and tea, I took a rest
nawying and cooking for a road party.’ Another
spell' of publication, varied by more nawying, fol-
lowed. “The lash of the Record drove the evildoers
to a frenzy of madness.” Followed another break in
publication, the editor being shipped off to the New
Norfolk lunatic asylum. He came back to the
island, but not for long, and since then has brought
out a few numbers at irregular intervals in Hobart
and finally in Melbourne. Stephenson would have
been a knight-errant if he had lived in the right
age, and, according to his autobiographical sketch,
the degeneracy of the times and the slight frame
that houses his fiery soul do not prevent him from
enjoying an occasional bout with other weapons than
the pen even in these days. He records with pride
that when he was shipped away from the island to
the asylum it took six men, all but two bigger than
himself, to get him on board the boat, and that at
his boarding-house in Melbourne recently he “rather
enjoyed kicking one of the attendants into decent
civility.”
Which recalls a visit the fiery Crusader
paid to The Bulletin office, “lou don t
seem a nervous man?” a tame office poet
suggested. Stephenson threw down his cap.
“I am afraid of nothing on earth,” he said,
“but of doing wrong.” And he meant it.

Harold Brash, Melbourne’s heavy-weight
piano-merchant, who used to be the amateur
sculling champion of his State, heard re-
cently from brother Alfred—he left Vic-
toria as a lieutenant in the A. 1.8 —to the
effect that he was off to Italy with an
adjutant’s job. Captain Brash is that Ait
Brasch who used to write Bulletin stories
in some of his spare "hours. The ongma
Brashes brought the c in their name from
Poland ; but they don’t want it now.^
Ernest Williams, the dark-haired patriot
who attends to Melbourne Punch’s adver-
tising when he isn’t at war, has got back
from England, via America, with the Dancey
and Nuttall cartoons which he has been ex-
hibiting on the other side.. Williams spent
five months on Gallipoli at L.II. head-
quarters, and was twice reported dead. He
may be; but in that case his ghost will go
on haunting advertisers. #
The latest journalistic venture has the
astonishing title of Katcankalaugood
Gazette. It is not as Red Indian as it
sounds, being really the rag of the men of
the Commonwealth Railways. Each three
letters of the name are in honor of (respec-
tively) Katherine River, Canberra, Kalgoor-
lie, (Port) Augusta and Oodnadatta. The
current number celebrates the opening of the
East-West line, and is welMllustrated.
“Chevron”: The Light Horse will soon
welcome Lieut. Harry Gullett to the Unholy
Land. He has been despatched on behalf ot
the War Records section of the A.1.8\ to
Palestine, there to act as a sort of subsidiary
Charlie Bean. Nephew of a former Svdnev
Herald editor, this farmer’s boy left the
plough for the pen, and did much good press-
work. especially as roundsman for
the Herald in early Commonwealth days.
Then he went to England, and, attaching
himself to the High Commissioner’s Office,
toiled awhile for Australian immigration. Ble
is married to a daughter of Barbara Bayn-
ton Bulletin contributor and author of
the’sombre and powerful “Bush Studies.”
THE FREELANCE.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
The freelance is a tameless soul,
Free as the mountain wild cat is he.
He need but write a little scroll
When he desires to earn a tizzie.
He’s at no boss’s rude command,
He hears no editorial curses ;
He pfens whatever comes to hand,
Cute stories, paragraphs or verses,
And thousands read and dozens praise him,
While frequently the owner pays him.
But there are flaws in freelance ways—
All is not roses, wine and honey.
If he indulge in holidays
’Tis understood he gets no money ;
If what he writes is piffle thought
No editor attempts to mask it,
But says straight out in “Answers” short
He’s chucked the rubbish in the basket.
Freelance is free his all to proffer,
And take what anyone may offer.
And comes, his soaring soul to fret,
With horrible insistence nightly
A nightmare and a chilly sweat:
He sees (and feels lie’s seeing rightly)
The Bulletin transformed, a -fat
And most portentous publication,
With verses stale, and stories flat,
And news about the farm and station,
And stolid blocks by “Spy” and “Phiz” in,
But not a single line of Ins in 1

The NEW EDISON
this Christmas
It is a gift that will delight everyone in 3-our home.
The world’s most beautiful music, played or sung just as if the artist stood
before you—is what is possible with The NEW EDISON.
There is no harshness, no jarring, no metallic timbre; just the pure, sweet,
natural tone with all the warmth and animation of having come direct to
your ears from the throat or instrument of the living artist.
You cannot realise what The NEW EDISON means to music until you
have heard it.
Mr. Edison realised that there would be thousands of sceptics and others •
unable to realise the true standing of his new art. So he invited the most
ruthless tests to which an instrument of this kind could possibly be put.
famous musicians were asked to sing or play in direct comparison with The
NEW EDISON before large audiences of music critics. And these astound-
ing tests proved beyond all doubt that The NEW EDlSON—most wonderful
ot all musical instruments —does Re-create the music exactly as originally
rendered.

All Souls’ Eve.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ACROSS tha fields of sleep my first
love came
With laughing eyes that mirrored
radiant youth
And head held high to the clean wind of
truth.
As honey to his lips he breathed my name;
And I who stood where purple clovers spilled
Their laughter on the green cliff o’er the sea,
Lifting my hands with their sweet madness
filled,
Caught his against my mouth in ecstasy.
Ah, it was noontide hour, and sheer sun-
light
Beat in great waves about us, and linked
through
With green and amber flame, in the high
. blue
A grey lark made long singing in its flight.
The Summer swung her censer, and our eyes
And hands were drawn together, though our
lips
Were shy save for the interchange of sighs,
And on the sky-line passed high-masted
ships.
And then we walked along the golden sands
Of Ivartigi’s long beach, and gathered shells,
Listening to hear the peal of magic bells
Ring from the ivory towers of distant lands.
So played we, and the sunset in a blaze
Of glory wrapped us. Soft began to creep
The twilight wind ; and as we stood at gaze,
Mouth strained to mouth, and love awoke
from sleep.
Quick, trembling fingers, higher turn the
flame—
This darkness and that dream! Ah, God
above!
Must I who traffic in the brass of love
Be flayed with yet another lash of shame?
As honey on his lips "he breathed my name. ..
From the green shores of the Aegean sea,
With smiling eyes and mouth my first love
came
Who sleeps so sound on far Gallipoli.
N.S.W.
NORA McAULIFFE.
The Municipal Dragon.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I HADN’T seen Bill Sunset for a year
when I got a ’phone message to go up
to him at 'the Islands Hotel. He was
looking brown and hearty as usual, and his
bright eyes told me he had something good on.
“What’s it tlii-s time?” I asked as soon as
we had settled down.
“It’s a dragon ! I”
“A ivliat?”
“A dragon, my boy—a real live dragon out
of China!” i
I studied his grinning face for a minute.
“And what are you going to do with him?
—sell him to a cireus or something like that,
I suppose!” \ ►
“No, I’ve got a better scheme than that.
I’m going to solve one of Sydney’s great
problems. I’m going to earn the gratitude of
aldermen and surfers and all sorts of people
by using him as a rubbish destructor!” He
sat back to watch the effect of it on me.
“He’s not a mythical beast,” Bill went on
presently, “but he’s so full of flame that the
insurance company has hit me for an enor-
mous premium and bound me down to keep
him in an isolated ferro-concrete house. I
assure you he’s a bit too full ofl flame for my
pocket just now. You see,” he added confi-
dentially, “it wouldn’t come so expensive if
he would only keep his flames inside him
where they can’t do any harm; but every
time he yawns or opens his mouth to roar
for rubbish (rubbish is what they feed on in
China, where I got him) great sheets of flame
come out and burn up the furniture and fit-
tings—if there happen to be any handy, bix
times he nearly burnt the old- tub we came
down in. Care to see him? Gome along,
then. It won’t take more than ten minutes.
We took a taxi, and it left us m a small
street in Woolloomooloo, close to the watei
front. The masts and funnels of ships stood
up jet-black against a sky of cold blue, ana
the rattling of winches and the hissing of
steam kept on shattering the peace of the
night. “Up here !” said Bill, scooting ahead.
“I’ve got him in an old stable for the pre-
sent, and the fire-station is only just round
the corner, in case anything should happen.
I saw a dull red reflection on a high
blank wall. “Is that it next to the foundry,
Bill?” I asked. , . . ,
“That isn’t a foundry —that s the old boy s
home. I suppose he’s getting hungry again.
We hurried into the jaws of a narrow lane
and presentlv I heard Bill kick softly on a
high door and call out something in Chinese.
I came up panting as a little wicket-door
opened. , . , T
“In you go!” said Bill, pushing me, and I
stumbled into a stone-flagged stable. The
smooth, yellow face of a suspicious-looking
young Chinaman was just visible in the glow
of the smoky hurricane-lantern that gleamed
at his feet. , cil • ,
Sunset closed the little door softly as he
followed me in. There was a whispered con-
sultation between the dragon s valet and Bill,
after which Bill turned to me.
“It’s all right—he hasn’t gone off to sleep
yet. I never like disturbing them once they
go to sleep—it seems to spoil their temper
and appetite. Now, just come up into the
gallerv and I’ll show you.”
He led the way up an iron ladder, and we
walked out on what seemed to be a sort of
overhead bridge. Below us in what had been
the central passage of the livery-stable was
something like a giant lizard with a long
alligator head. Even in the half-daikness
the thing looked dry as an oven, and the air
above it palpitated with heat.
“I’ll try it with some rubbish.” whispered
Bill, and tipped down a bin-full of soggy
remnants of past food, old hats, newspapers
—the usual dreadful mixture.
It was all over with a flash of fierce light.
I remembered afterwards that as the debris
was falling, the lizard head flashed up and
the refuse fell into an open mouth. The hot
jaws slammed to as the last banana-skin
passed the fireproof fangs.
“Wonderful, Bill! Is there anything he
won’t take?’’ I shuddered, for the basilisk
eyes of the thing, staring up, seemed to be
considering me as food.
“Not as far as I know. Try him with
your handkerchief.”
I tossed the thing over and the head
opened once more and allowed the white trifle
to fall in. It was like looking into the fur-
nace of a locomotive when the fireman has
left the door open. The white fleck of cam-
bric melted in flame before the jaws came to-
gether again and shut off the light.
“Bill,” I whispered, “why don’t you get
a few of them to send against the Germans?”
He didn’t seem to hear me. At any rate,
instead of answering he asked: “What do you
think is a fair price to tap the Bogtown
Council for him? I think about £1500.”
“But,” I said, “it seems such a degrading
use for such an animal!”
“Well, old man, I can’t afford to keep
him to make toast with, and he’s too hot for
a footwarmer. Besides, you see how he
enjoys eating rubbish.”
“Yes,” I agreed, “he certainly does enjoy
it. By the way, he doesn’t eat anything else,
does he?”
Bill satisfied himself that the dragon’s serv-
ing-man was out of earshot before he re-
plied in a low voice : “Not so far as I know.
I always warn people to be careful, as a
matter of course ; but I don’t know for cer-
tain.”
I took a sideways observation of the un-
winking, pitiless eyes below. “I don’t like
his eyes,” I said.
“Neither do I. But Sin Fat will have to
put up with them until to-morrow at five,
when the Bogtown Council comes down to
inspect him.”
We dodged past the Horror very carefully
and at the door Bill stopped to give Sin Fat
a few directions. The Chinaman held the
lantern aloft while Bill talked, and it struck
me afterwards that the savage yellow face,
with its tight-stretched skin, had quivered a
little. Then the door shut off the illuminated
Asian mask and I heard within a stealthy
scuffle of iron chains on the smooth unyield-
ing concrete floor.
“What a job!” I shuddered.
Bill and I hurried down next afternoon in
order to get there a little ahead of the Bog-
townsmen ; and it was just as well we did.
When we knocked on the door no Sin Fat
opened it; but there was a burst of fright-
ened monkey chatter and then silence.
“What’s happened?” groaned Bill, and
knocked again softly. Once more we heard
frightened squeaks and yammering.
“Good God ! I hope nothing’s wrong ! Got
any Yale keys with you? Let’s try the lock.”
The seventh key did it. But Bill wasn’t
rash enough to bound into the dragon’s den.
He took a squinting observation, and, seeing
Old Stovepipe apparently brooding tran-
quilly, stepped in gingerly. There was no
Sin Fat to greet him.
“Wow-ee ! Yow-yow—whoo-oo !”
We threw our heads back involuntarily.
There, crouching on a badly-scorched rafter,
was a blackened, singed caricature of a man
with the fear of hell in his rolling eyes. Be-
tween yelps and squeals he licked his poor
singed limbs like a wounded dog.
“Come down. Sin Fat!” called Bill. But
he might as well have addressed a scared cat.
When we made signs to him, the Chinaman
whimpered and cowered farther into the cor-
ner. Then we noticed that the Horror had
turned its head and was staring at him
malevolently.
“God ! What a night he must have had !
But we’ll have to get him down somehow and
have his burns dressed. Nice sort of chance
we’d have of doing business if the councillors
saw what was likely to happen to one of the
council employees !”
But the poor, witless thing up on the
rafter gibbered back at him and folded itself
away in an impossibly small and shadowy
recess. We had neither the gear nor the
time for a rescue just then.
“He will do for the present,” muttered
Bill, as wheels were heard outside. “It
will be all right so long as he doesn’t
howl!” And then the aldermen were upon
us.
They swarmed fussily into our stone cham-
ber of horrors, a moving haze of dullness,
in the centre of which floated an inflated
globule of importance. He needed no
herald to announce him—he was “Mister
Mayor,” self-made, and a poor job.
“. .. . th’ cost of a modern de-structor
suitable to th’ needs of our growin’ muni-
cipality is histimated at two thousan’
pounds. But hif we make hup our minds to
axcipt Mister Sunset’s hoffer and give £l5OO
for this draggin’ we make a savin’ of £5OO
right horf.”
“Wot is'th’ haverage life of a draggin?”
asked an old and canny alderman.
“Nobody knows!” snapped Bill.
“Well, ’ow old is this draggin?”
“I don’t know, sir.”
The alderman preened himself. “Mister
Mayor, I c’nsider it’s too big a risk. Wot
guarantee ’ave we that th’ draggin’ won’t die
on our ’ands?” He held out his pudgy paws
dramatically towards the red-hot monster.
“I am guaranteeing him Tor 12 months,
sir,” replied Bill very civilly.
“And Hi,” interpolated the Mayor— “Hi
was thinkin’ of insurin’ th’ beast’s life —if
it could be done.”
“Ow —yow —yow !” whimpered Sin Fat
from the roof-shadows.
His Worship bristled. “Hi c’nsider that
an insultin’ interjection ! Hi call on Aider-
man Trumpet t’ ’pologise!”
“I said nothin’!” exclaimed old Alderman
Trumpet.
“P’raps it was the draggin. Mister
Mayor!” This being the contribution of the
Council wit, everybody laughed excepting his
Worship, who, when order had been restored,
remarked suspiciously: “It didn’t seem th’
sort o’ sound a draggin would make !” Then
he went on with his speech: “In addition
to the first savin’ of five ’undred, there is
th’ constant savin’ in th’ hupkeep, istimated

is a healer of great purity and refinement. Daily
examples of Zam-Buk’s swift, clean healing and
its utility in a thousand emergencies justify the
high claims made for this celebrated “first-aid”
and skin remedy.
There is nothing that is capable of more marvel-
lous healing and curative action. Zam-Buk is
Nature’s healer. When it is applied to the bruised
or broken skin any danger of the wound taking
had ways is removed. 8
There are also Poisoned Sores, Ulcers and Bad
Legs, Ringworms and Scalp Sores, burning Eczema
and aggravating Piles, that tell their tale in their
own weakening and distressing way. All are
relieved, and in many cases the surgeon’s knife
is evaded by the marvellous healing power of Zam-
Buk. \
GREAT SEARING BURN
Mrs. E. Cooper, of 37 Ware Street,
Hobart, Tas., writes:—“My little son,
Bertie, knocked over a very hot lamp-
glass. This fell on the calf of his leg,
inflicting a great searing burn. Although
we used various remedies the leg re-
mained in a shocking state. Then it was
that we heard about Zam-Buk. Besides
soothing and healing the wound in a re-
markable manner, Zam-Buk cleansed the
sore place and new skin began to form.
Continued applications of Zam-Buk healed
Bertie’s leg in a few days.”
Zam - Buk is
excellent for
sores, cuts,
burns, scalds,
sprains, sun -
burn, etc.

A DIFFERENCE.
The Auto Strop is different from every other kind
of safety razor. Only those who have tried it
can appreciate its vast superiority. You can
put up a new keen edge on the blade daily—
by simply slipping the strop through the razor
and passing it to and fro.

As a safety razor it eliminates risk: and its special
construction eliminates the necessity of constant
blade renewals, and the time and trouble in
Cleaning which every other safety razor involves.

at an ’undred and fifty p’r year. On top o’
that it seems reasonable to liadd say four
undred for exhibition fees for th’ first year
alone. Mr. Sunset says we can safely
reckin on bein’ th’ only municipal draggin-
owners in Australia f’r at least a year ; an’ I
need ’ardly remind you gen'l'men wot that
monopoly means. I wouldn’t be surprised if
we got all the purchase money back in’ th’
first year!” (Applause.)
“Sounds all right!” sneered Alderman
Trumpet; “but I can’t say I like the idea
of mixin’ up circus business with municipal
business. I ain’t certain that th’ Local
Gover’ment Act would allow us to do it.”
“That,” said the Mayor scornfully, “that
is our dear old conservative friend, Alderman
Trumpet!”
“And now,”- continued his Worship, “as I
appear to ’ave effect’ally silenced th’ Voice
of th’ Parst, I will resume where I left orf!
(Laughter.) Councillors will see from this
that a unique chance is offered us of solvin’
at one stroke th’ troublesome garbage pro-
blim an’ possibly of makin’ a profit on”
“Wow —ah —yow ! Whoo-ee !” (Uproar-
ious laughter.)
“Halderman Trumpet! Ilif you do that
again”
“Who says I did it? If anyone say I made
that d —n row, ’e’s a liar, an’ I tell ’im so
to ’is face!”
The purple-faced Mayor looked about him
helplessly. “Come, now ! Let’s get on with
the business. I think th’ proposition ’as
been fully put before you, and you ’ave
between now an’ t’-night at 8 o’clock to
c’nsider ’ow you will vote. I may say that
I ’ave ’ad th’ pleasure of seein’ this animal
work, an’ I can assure you ’e does ’is work
in a truly marv’lous way. Now, Mister
Sunset,” turning to Bill, “would you mind
givin’ us a little demonstration?”
“Certainly,” said Bill. “But perhaps the
gentlemen would like to look at the garbage
first? Please to notice that it is a particu-
larly rough and rancid collection, including
two dead cats.” The aldermen examined the
dreadful stuff and testified that it was all
that could be desired.”
“Now, gentlemen,” said Bill, mounting
the gallery and giving a nervous side-glance
at the corner where Sin Fat was cower-
ing unseen, “the action of the dragon is so
rapid that you need to watch closely. All
ready?... .Right!” He tipped a bin of
rubbish, there was a burst of flame, and a
dreadful scream of terror —and it was all
over. The dragon was as still as if it had
never moved an eyelash.
“What d’ye think o’ that?” exclaimed the
Mayor proudly, in the scared silence that
followed.
Alderman Trumpet, very white and ner-
vous, was the only one who answered.
“ ’Orrible ! Beas’ly ! Wot’s the good of
a thing that screams like that w’en it
works? W’y, we’d ’ave th’ ratepayers down
on us in two-twos!”
The Mayor turned doubtfully to Bill.
“W’y does it make that screamin’ noise, sir?
It didn’t make it lars’ time.”
“Oh —er —l think perhaps it might be
nervous.”
“Nervis!” shouted Alderman Trumpet
angrily. “Wot’s the good of rubbish destruc-
tors that get nervis?”
This put the Mayor on his mettle. “But
ain’t it jus’ possible, gen’l’men, that this
remarkable animal ’ad to make a speshul
effort ter swaller this trooly ’orrible dose
we’ve jus’ given him? An’ see ’ow clean an’
quick ’e done it —all over, as you might say,
in a jiffy! I c’nsider we would be foolish
ter miss this chance. Any’ow, you ’ave seen
what it can do, an’ now I think we might
thank Mr. Sunset for ’is kindness an’ get
’ome.”
* * * *
It took us almost an hour to coax the
Chinaman down; and he fell into a
paroxysm of terror when the brute made the
slightest move. It was plain that he would
never be groom to a dragon again. Bill
took him away in a cab to a decent-enough
private hospital while I stayed and looked
after the dragon—from the outside. I told
myself that if the brute wanted anything it
could scream for it.
Next day Bill got the glad news that the
Bogtown Council (Alderman Trumpet and
another dissenting) had decided to purchase
the dragon and instal it as the municipal
destructor. A few nights later it was taken
away in a specially-covered jinker and in-
stalled amidst subdued aldermanic rejoic-
ings in a disused slaughterhouse. Bill stood
by for a week, during which the Horror
swallowed rubbish at a fearful rate, and
never once screamed —a fact which caused
Alderman Trumpet bitter grief and gave the
Mayor great joy. “There y’are, Trumpet!”
he _ would say, “the thing does its work
orright, an’ don’t make nearly as much noise
as you do!”
But Bill Sunset wasn’t easy in his mind.
“Just like them!” he complained. “Instead
of getting a reliable man, they’ve put a for-
getful messer called Poddle in charge—-
the sort of fool to leave the door open or
'something!”
And that's what Poddle did, just when
the successful experiment was starting to
get noticed in the papers. The Horror
slipped away unseen as quickly as a racing
motor-car, and was first sighted by a vege-
table John, who came tranquilly out of a
neighbor’s garden to find a 40-foot devil on
end shovelling greenstuff into its flaming
mouth with its two front paws, while a mad-
dened horse screamed and plunged and tried
to kick itself free of the dray. The super-
stitious Chow immediately howled and fell
on his knees gabbling Shinto prayers, and
the dragon back-pedalled from the dray and
scuttled away at giant-lizard speed into the
dry scrub, through which it could soon be
traced by the fires it started.
Before night the smoke of its progress,
blown back by a stiff northerly wind, was
seen and smelt in the city streets. The
dragon was making north at a rapid rate and
a detachment of field artillerymen with two
guns and a Maxim were trying to intercept
it. The Mayor of Bogtown had refused to
be interviewed ; but Alderman Trumpet was
eloquent in a column. And meanwhile £l5OO
worth of the Council’s money (or Sunset’s
money) scuttled through the coast bush
setting fire to every inflammable thing it
breathed on. The machine-gunners, who
had loaded their Maxim on a motor, came up
with it on the third day and opened fire at
1000 yards. The shower of bullets startled
the brute so that it rushed down a stony
slope and plunged into the river below. A
cloud of steam rose in the air as it dis-
appeared, and the gunners swung round their
weapon to command the stream further
down in case it should rise. But it never
did. Either it wasn’t built for swimming or
else the open-mouthed plunge put out its
fires. At any rate, it was washed up on
the water frontage of a down-river settler
three days later, and that harassed bushie,
after undergrounding the remains, sent the
Bogtown Council a brief account:
Dr. to Joe Stokes, to Buryin’ One Dragin, £2.
(Please remit—it was a stinkin’ job.)

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rp OM DONALDSON found Crick propped
against a stump on Pill Hill one hot
morning when the rock-ribbed range
was just a grid under the spluttering
November sun. The man was all out, and
Donaldson took him on his back and
humped him home, a distance of something
over two miles. There he was bedded down
for five weeks, during which time the Don-
aldsons, who did not know him from a
crow, bestowed upon him the attention they
might have given to a beloved brother, and
comforts far beyond their limited means. The
patient got well and the day of parting came.
He had hinted at some remuneration. The
hints had been coldly received. Finally
he spoke out. He felt he had been a bur-
den and a drain upon them all this time,
and even if he could never repay their great
kindness, he might “Not a bean,” said
Donaldson, emphatically. “Not a stiver,”
said Mrs. Donaldson. Crick accepted the
situation, but he was not satisfied. He had
a shrewd suspicion that the Donaldsons were
pretty well down to it, and looking round
for a chance hit upon what he thought was
a happy idea. Donaldson’s skin-bag was at
the kitchen door. It was a prospect Tom
had brought down from Pill Hill the even-
ing before. He would wash it in the rain-
barrel presently. Crick seized an oppor-
tunity, and dropped a fistful of gold from the
mine he had recently finished at Redhead
into Donaldson’s bag. Then he bade his
friends an affectionate adieu, and went his
way. The West called" to him a few
weeks later, and westward he went. He
spent nearly seven years on the Westralian
fields, and ret rned to Melbourne with pro-
vision for his old age in the shape of
£30,000 worth of shares that were yielding
at the rate of £3OOO per annum.
Having exhausted the allurements of the
metropolis, Crick started wondering what he
was going to do with himself, and the Donald-
sons came back to his mind. He took train for
Bairnsdale right away, and coached to the
vicinity of Pill Hill. His first inquiries
concerning Donaldson were not reassuring.
“He’s hereabouts somewhere,” said Cam-
eron of the Big Store, “but I haven’t seen
him for months. The general opinion is
he’s fair off his trolly. He’s mad about a
reef somewhere up the range, and he’s pretty
well starved himself to death prospecting.
More than once he’s had to be brought away
out of a cuttin’ up there, and sorter forcibly
fed. Oh, he’s dipped all right.” “But what
of his wife?” asked Crick. “Dead these
four years,” was the reply. “Went under
with a broken heart, if you ask me, seein’
his nibs so dilly about the reef. Reef?
Struth! I don’t think there’s a peck of
payable quartz within 20 mile of Pill Hill.”
Crick took a horse, a tent, and traps and
tucker, and went out along the range in search
of Tom Donaldson. He found him after a
three days’ hunt, pegging away in a trench
that offered all the most acceptable indica-
tions of an utterly barren locality aurifer-
ously considered. The man was terribly
pulled down, gaunt, hollow-eyed, ill-nour-
ished, his dilated pupils all too eloquent of
the strange derangement that possessed him.
Crick had some difficulty in awakening Don-
aldson’s memory. Evidently there was
room for little in his wrecked mind apart
from his great quest. But presently Tom
remembered. “They think I am mad,” he
said. “All round here they tell me it to my
face. They say there’s no reef at Pill
Hill. It’s them that’s fnad. What I know
I know. I don’t give away my secret to
these chumps, but you’re different. There
is a reef. She's lousy with gold—she’s
plastered with it, ’n’ one day I’ll get her.
and there’ll be millions for "me—millions!
I got the proof of it one day. I’d taken a
prospect from the surface down there by
the foot of the ridge. There was three ’n’
a quarter ounces in it—three ’n’ a quarter
ounces in one dish of dirt! It wasn’t
alluvial gold; not one really water-
worn speck in it, ’n’ plenty of specimens.
I kept some. I don’t mind showin’ you.
but I keep ’em from this fool crowd at Pill
Hill.” Donaldson nervously tugged at the
lace of a small chamois bag. He poured a
number of specimens into his palm. Crick
recognised them, and an oath broke on his
tongue. They were portion of the gold he
had smuggled into Donaldson’s dirt the
morning of his leaving Pill Hill seven years
ago.
Hell is paved with good intentions.

OMETHING
If Engineers and Steam-plant Owners would only
realise the importance of EFFICIENTLY insulating
their Boilers, Steam Pipes, etc., more attention might
be paid to this particular matter. Great economies
can be effected in this direction, in some cases the coal
consumption being reduced as much as 50%. But the
insulating material must be of the very best.
Carbonate of Magnesia is to-day recognised as the best
non-conductor of heat. Newall s Coverings are com-
posed of 85% of this material, and 15% Asbestos—the
Asbestos being used for binding purposes only—and in
addition possess innumerable advantages over all other
forms of lagging. Newall’s Coverings are used, practi-
cally exclusively, by the British Admiralty, N.S.W.
and Victorian Governments, and have been used
throughout the Ultimo. White Bay, Melbourne, Perth
and Canberra Power Stations.
