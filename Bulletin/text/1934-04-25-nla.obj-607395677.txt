The Brisbane “Telegraph”

Whatever may be said for or against
the books reviewed below it won’t be
denied that they are vivid to a degree.
By comparison with the drab yarns about
tired Londoners with no beliefs and few
enthusiasms for anything but talk and
cocktails —the staple literary fare offered
to Australia by most English publishers
nowadays—they shine like torches on a
dark night. With it all they contain sur-
prisingly little ballyhoo. Sentiment,
emotion, passion, yes; but the moron
appeal which distinguishes a love-story
by Ethel Dell from one by Hardy,
a screen tragedy from a tragedy by
Shakspeare, is missing. These works
show how writers can be touching, con-
troversial, exciting, romantic, while re-
taining their artistic integrity. The great
Victorians brought it off as a matter of
course, and Shaw, Wells and one or two
more still manage it from time to time.
But it is so rare among the younger
writers as to be thrilling when encoun-
tered.
A Father’s Troubles
The only objection that can fairly be
taken to Marguerite Steen’s Matador
(Gollancz; Bs.) is that it has an air of
derivativeness. The reader keeps strik-
ing ideas and characters that recall
“Death in the Afternoon.” There is a
repellent old lady with a filthy mind who
is thrown out of the book when
her senile lubricity gets unbearable.
Hemingway’s view of Joselito and
America’s only.matador is accepted, and
there is a drug-taking American million-
airess with a craze for bullfighters. There
is also much profound rubbish about
“emotional veronicas” and the like,
the jargon of bullring critics being
as easy to pick up evidently as that of
art critics. Yet it is a great and moving
story; the story of any successful father.
Don Jose, ex-matador, has three sons.
The eldest, Pepe, is his idol and a waster.
Death takes Pepe. Miguel, the second, is
a humpback and a source of shame.
Miguel causes his father anguish by de-
serting the Church to join the revolution-
aries. Juan, the youngest, is an “ineffec-
tual angel”; good, handsome, a poet,
eager to please his father, but weak and
timid. Bullfighting revolts him. He falls
in love with his adopted sister Pilar—
another St. Cecilia —and leaves her, his
home and the Church to join Miguel.
So the hard, vain, dissolute ex-matador
is left with his God, and through his
God comes, “slowly and uncertainly into
a way of peace.”
His adventures occur in a rich atmo-
sphere of sunshine, mediaeval supersti-
tion, lust, dirt, dust and Spanish per-
fumes and stenches. The scenery is
somewhat stagey, and so are the char-
acters, but they make a glowing picture
between them which is turned from with
regret.
From Abbe to General
The phenomenally ugly son of the
Comte de Soissons and Mazarin’s niece
Olympia, an early mistress of the Sun
King, had a more glamorous and dan-
gerous career than any matador. In
Prince Eugene (Gollancz; Dymock’s;
165.) Paul Frischauer not only traces in
some detail the history of the most ori-
ginal if not the greatest soldier of the
seventeenth century from his birth in the
Palais Soissons in 1663 to his death in
his Viennese palace 73 years later ; he
brings many strange aspects of the period
to light and life. Eugene’s campaigns
contain no lessons for modern tacticians ;
he lives in military memory only as the
first general of modern times who made
the well-being of his men a first con-
sideration. It had nothing to do with
humanitarianism; he was weak in man-
power.
Frischauer represents him as suffering
from an inferiority complex. As a
boy he worshipped Louis XIV., who,
the Court said, was his father. But
Louis, whose “vanity suffered with
every fault in ap-
pearance and be-
havior of both
his legitimate and
illegitimate child-
ren,” would have
nothing to do
with him. There was an agonising
occasion when he stood waiting for the
King to speak—being debarred by Court
etiquette from speaking first —and the
King said nothing.
The biographer implies that this
caused him to leave France and offer
his services to Austria. But he had
no prospects as a French officer in
any event; his mother had been ban-
ished ; the achievements of his mighty
great-uncle, the cardinal-diplomat, were
being referred to slightingly by the
King’s orders. He may have derived a
malicious pleasure in after years from
the knowledge that his victories were
adding to the humiliations of the
wretched old man at Versailles; it is
more probable, from what we know of
his character, that he never gave the
matter a thought. Still it gives a human
touch to a story which would otherwise
be a mere record of astounding triumphs
in the face of every imaginable handicap.
Eugene remained to the end the
“little Abbe” he had been when he
wore the tonsure; an ascetic to
whom women meant nothing. His
friendship as an old man with Coun*
tess Battyani was, to quote the bio-
grapher, “the friendship of a man
for the woman in whom he believed to
have discovered the beloved mother.”
The Countess von Zeppelin’s transla-
tion, as may be gathered from this pas-
sage, is awkward. The book is beauti-
fully got up. As a frontispiece-it has
the merciless portrait which the prince
is said to have liked, though it emphasises
his shortage of nose and simian upper lip.
Kerensky on Bolshevism
The Crucifixion of Liberty, by-Alex-
ander Kerensky (Arthur Barker; 155.),
resembles an impassioned speech. It has
no continuity. The theme is the infamy
of the Bolsheviks (“the history of Europe
knows no dictatorship more reactionary,
more absolute, more disastrous for the
people and the country”), and the author
expounds it from scores of angles.
The world is no longer interested in
Kerensky as a personality; he had his
chance, failed and is accepted now as a
weakling. However, he is a match-
less witness of the events that led to the
downfall of Czarism, because he had
played a leading part in the revolution-
ary movement for 20 years before the
abdication, because he was in the Duma
at the time of the abdication and after-
wards, because he knew personally all
the dramatis personce, from the arch-
reactionary Rasputin to the arch-Bol-
shevik Lenin. If you want to read a
penetrating, yet sympathetic, analysis of
Nicholas ll.’s character ; an equally pene-
trating, though less friendly, account of
the part played by the Czarina, and esti-
mates of Rasputin and Lenin which will
enable you to understand just why they
rose to power when they did—then get
The Crucifixion of Liberty. You will
have to wade through pages of irrele-
vancies and redundancies, for this is
Kerensky’s apologia pro vita sua ; but
the trouble is worth it. With all its de-
fects of construction and style, it is one
of the few post-war books about Russia
which will certainly be turned to by
future historians.

had heard since Bright’s day.
He makes no secret of the fact that

of course, be learned. Oratory, being in
the nature of an art, is a different matter.
There are no actual rules. You can
make a platform voice, if you haven’t
got one. Almost any voice can be given
the chief requirement —resonance, or
tone —by practice.
The next problem is enunciation. If
you have a pleasing accent, well and
good. If not, so much the worse. In
any event it is far better to speak clearly
than to produce honeyed tones that few
can hear. Mr. Mitchell has a strong
Glasgow accent.
The next point is to “put the matter
across.” You are to speak. The audi-
ence want to hear you. They will be
intensely annoyed if they discover you
are just a bad imitation of a celebrity.
Be yourself. Believe that the audience
is yearning to listen to you, and to you
alone. Reach out to them, and they will
respond.
As for matter, you should know as
much about your subject as possible. If
you don’t know a lot more than the
average of your audience you will crash.
And you should learn to think in phrases.
This is one of the chief tricks of the
trade. All those beautiful periods which
fall so gracefully from the lips of
speakers like Winston Churchill, Roose-
velt, Bruce, W. M. Hughes don’t spring
out of the void. They have been passed
through the speakers’ minds many times
before. It is best not to memorise, but
it is necessary to have slabs of rhetoric
on hand, so to speak, in order to lend
richness to the beggarly elements of your
speech.
The ground is thoroughly covered from
the debating society to the pulpit. The
chapter on “Pulpit and Pew,” written
from the standpoint of a long-suffering
victim, should be studied by every clergy-
man-reader of The Bulletin. If priests
and parsons would read this chapter
only, in a spirit of humility and with
a desire for self-improvement, there
might be fewer empty churches after a
while.
William Bottomley, who is tutor in
public speaking at Melbourne University,
has just written a handbook on the same
subject. How to Become an Effective
Public Speaker is the name. Robert-
son and Mullens are the publishers
and the price is Is. He offers
much the same advice as Mr. Mitchell,
though in a more condensed form, and
in addition he gives some hints on how
to tell a story and on the art of broad-
casting.
GERALD DILLON.
An Early Modern
D. P. McGuire in The Poetry of
Gerard Manley Hopkins (English Asso-
ciation, Adelaide branch ; 25.) does some
special pleading for the poet’s work, and
makes, for the most part, a scholarly
and persuasive job of it.
Hopkins wrote his most characteristic
verse between 1875 and his death (at 45)
in 1889. At their day school in High-
gate he and Marcus Clarke were close
friends. Clarke went to Australia and
Hopkins to Balliol, where he came into
the Newman aura, turned Roman Catho-
lic, and eventually took orders as a
Jesuit.
Every estimate of Hopkins is personal.
It is only partly true that the most that
the Catholic creative mind can achieve,
since the Reformation, is the mannered
grace of Alice Meynell or the tapestried
attitudes of Francis Thompson. However,
the t Catholic writer does demand a
special reader. “The Hound of Heaven”
has the musical richness of a Pontifical
High Mass in St. Peter’s, with all the
fascinating twiddley-bits; but the reader
needs to realise the solemn significance
of these bits as well as their attractive-
ness before the splendid stained-glass pic-
ture comes to full life. Even so, there
are obscurities.
So also with Hopkins. “The priest in
Hopkins,” Mr. McGuire says, “blinded
Bridges (who was critical) to much of
the virtue of the poet.” Exactly; and
where the keen eyes of Robert Bridges
are blinded, how can the rest of us hope
to see?
A beetling baldright cloud through England
Riding: there did storms not mingle? And
Hailropes hustle and grind their
Heavengravel? Wolfsnow, worlds of it, wind
there?
And again:
Thou mastering me
God! giver of breath and bread;
World’s strand, sway of the sea;
Lord of living and dead;
Thou hast bound bones and veins in me,
fastened me flesh,
And after it almost unmade, what with dread,
ihy doing: and dost thou touch me afresh?
Over again I feel thy finger and find thee.
Mr. McGuire quotes both these ex-
amples as of especial, and equal, beauty.
Obviously, only the special reader could
bother with the first quotation at all.
Equally obviously, the second is magni-
ficent.
Hopkins has been called a great genius,
a forerunner, a man before his time, the
maker of a new language, and a deal
more. Mr. McGuire falls sometimes into
this swelter of enthusiasm: “I doubt
whether even Shakspeare has such a rich
and substantial texture”
Without comment on that resonant
doubt, it is fair to repeat the general
reader’s view of Hopkins as a minor poet
who was a great surprise in 1918 when
Bridges made him known, whose work
has an ecstatic religious poignancy and is
at times very fine, at other times not so
fine, and now and again distinctly bad.
H. L.
Coincidence
A minor tragedy of the Great War
was the death of the British Ambassador
to the U.S., Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, shortly
after his recall. Sir Walter Raleigh, the
critic, wrote that Spring-Rice’s “I Vow to
Thee, My Country,” and Grenfell’s “Into
Battle” were his favorite war poems.
Amongst Spring-Rice’s papers the editor
of his letters found two stanzas headed
“Urbs Dei,” of which this is the first:
I hear my country calling away across the
Across the waste of waters she calls and calls
to me.
Her sword is girded at her side, her helmet
on her head, .
And round her feet are lying the dying and
the dead.
I hear the noise of battle, the thunder of
her guns,
I haste to thee, my mother, a son among thy
sons.
Among the few really fine poems in-
spired by the war was one written by
Private James D. Burns, of Scotch Col-
lege, Melbourne. He was only 18 at
the time, and he didn’t survive long
enough to write more poetry.
The bugles of England were blowing o’er the
sea,
As they had called a thousand years, calling
now to me; .
They woke me from dreaming in the dawning
of the day,
The bugles of England—and how could I stay?
The third verse runs:
O England! I heard the cry of those that
died for thee,
Sounding like an organ voice across the winter
sea.
They lived and died for England, and gladly
went their way.
England! O England! how could I stay?
There is a striking resemblance in
feeling and expression between young
Burns’s poem and that of the former
Ambassador.
There can, of course, be no hint of
plagiarism. The Australian boy was dead
long before Spring-Rice’s casually scrib-
bled lines found their way into print.
Evidently both experienced the same surge
of patriotic feeling, and both were im-
pelled to express themselves in much the
same terms. I doubt if the same thing
has ever happened before in the case
of two human beings so widely separated
by age, by geographical and other environ-
ment, and by culture.
CONSTANCE E. LEWERS.
Laughing England’s Democracy
Away
A book that has just been published
here is raising Cain among the somewhat
smug altruists who believe it is their mis-
sion to remake the world. This is Hyde
Park Orator, by Bonar Thompson. All
who have visited the area near the
Marble Arch on which the soap-boxers
discourse every Sunday afternoon know
Bonar and have laughed at his digs at
everything and everybody. He has often
been in gaol, but never for moral delin-
quency. He is England’s leading public
jester, a born debunker.
“Stop snivelling about your troubles,”
I heard him tell his usual audi-
ence a few Sundays ago. “Who wants
to hear of them? They bore people.
You’re always envying someone. You
want to be like Bernard Shaw, and make
a lot of money without working. Good
God! Do you know Shaw? I do, and
a bigger bore I never met. Think of his
poor wife. She’s got to live with him.”
In his book he shouts to the house-
tops his hatred of work ; his knowledge
of the real inwardness of socialists and
Communists; his contempt for the
trusted leaders of the underworld. He
regards democracy as one of civilisa-
tion’s best jokes.
At the age of 13 he arrived in
Manchester from the North of Ire-
land, and immediately began studying
how to earn a living without working
for it. His disarming frankness on this
question shakes the reader to sudden
yelps of mirth. The tale of his decision
to become a soap-box orator, as opening
up an easy way to avoid toil, is perhaps
the best, but there are at least half a
dozen other classics. He began to study
socialism and allied doctrines because he
felt that to mouth such rubbish was the
surest way to popularity with the multi-
tude. Later he discovered that a park
orator got his best effects and roused
the warmest interest and approval by
attacking his auditors.
Crowds like to be castigated. Each
member thinks that he is the exception,
the speaker’s remarks do not apply to turn,
it is the others who are being indicated.
A speaker can never go wrong, therefore,
in cursing his hearers roundly. He is
really cursing a crowd of exceptions, each,
one of whom is delighted to hear the
others denounced so trenchantly.
Thompson habitually flays those who
listen to him, and they grin and like it.
In the course of his life he has met many
of the so-called great ones. All appear
in his book, and all appear as unimpor-
tant as he can make them look.
Be sure to get Hyde Park Orator
if you want to see into the soul of a
congenital rogue and vagabond, and if
you want also to get an insight into the
laughing, tolerant nature of the im-
memorial Cockney.

A Satchel or Books
/, the Tiger (Heinemann ; 7s. 6d.),
purports to be the autobiography of a
Bengal tiger, trapped while little more
than a cub and exhibited in circuses and
zoos. Actually it is no more than such
a work could hope to be—the reflections
of a man who has imagined himself
into a tiger’s skin, but still sees the world
through human eyes. Nevertheless,
Manuel Komroff has written an interest-
ing book, which contains much bitter-
sweet philosophy.
All people spend when they hear a

then, too, they liketo exhibit themsel
and try to make us caged beasts think
they are free, which is, of course, not
true, but it is worth ten cents.
Turn Again, Ladies, by Francesca
Claremont (Cassell; Angus and Robert-
son ; 7s. 6d.). A war-time romance. Rose
marries Alan, widower, all in a few
rhC u met ° n j hol l da : a
didn t know her artist friends, she didn t
know his schoolgirl daughter Anna. In-
compatibility is indicated from the first,
and then poor little Anna gets knocked
down and killed by a car while on a
message for Rose. After that a reshuffle
is only a question of time. They re all
decent, normal and generally likeable
people, and most of them talk brightly
without seeming to be overconscious
of it.
Neat little romances like The Glen-
garry Girl, by Ralph Connor (The Bod-
ley Head; 7s. 6d.), appear by the dozen.
Sylvia Rivers is one of the prettiest
and most accomplished young ladies in
Canada, and her young man is equally
handsome and even more accomplished,
but they can’t seem to make up their
minds. Peggy, who knows some of the
facts of life, though only 15, gets mad
about it.
“What has conscience got to do with
loving a man? It is right to love him,
and it is right to show him you love
him. You talk to me about animal pas-
sions”... .she turned suddenly and fiercely
upon Sylvia, sobs choking her utter-
ance “That boy wants you. He wants
your love, and you talk economics. He
wants to feel your body in his arms, your
lips on his lips. Economics? Damn
economics.”
Sylvia fixed it up after that.
C.0.D., by “Anabas” (Hodder and
Stoughton; Dymock’s; 7s. 6d.), is a
hearty colloquial R.N. yarn, in which
the characters never forget their respec-
tive positions in the social hierarchy;
relate most political problems to the
Flag; and hate Bolshies as they once
hated the Boche. The crew of the tramp
Daphne consists entirely of axed R.N.
ranks and ratings. The Daphne is at
Leningrad with a cargo of coal when
a Red officer rushes on board, drawn
sword in hand.
“One of those cursed Whites is hidden
on board!”
“Why should he be?”
With a sneer the officer replied: “Why
should he be, the cursed rat? Because,”
poking out a dirty finger and almost touch-
ing Ord-Dale’s coat, “he was one of the old
Tsar’s officers and, like yourself, a Navy
man—and like goes to like.”
Ord-Dale drew himself erect, frowning
slightly.
“I should certainly advise you, sir, to
keep your paws away from me, and be
civil.”
Anti-monarchists always get icy recep-
tions of the sort from the ex-officers, and
the qpmic insuUs heaped on them by
one-time members of the lower deck are
no less humiliating. It will certainly be
a best-seller in the Portsmouth-Southsea-
Fareham sector, and there should be
many who understand the jargon and
sympathise with the point of view in
Australia.

THE GREAT IMPOSTURE.
Vice-president Remington, of the
New South Wales Constitutional Asso-
ciation, told a microphone the other
day that, “if party politics were abol-
ished and every man voted accord-
ing to his conscience, democratic insti-
tutions would be abolished and the clock
put back 200 to 300 years.”
The electoral laws are framed to
enable every man to vote accord-
ing to his conscience, but apparently
when a man becomes an M.P. he
rises to an ethical stratum in which
expediency is his only law and party
pressure his only guide. Mr. Reming-
ton seems to infer that democracy is
already dead, inasmuch as he suggests
that only the inner group and the
National Club stand between its con-
tinuance and a reversion to the methods
of the Stuarts. A well-organised party
should, he implies, rule irrespective of
the will of individual citizens. Could
anything be more undesirable? A tyrant
at least has a neck by which he may be
suspended, and a sense of self-preserva-
tion which shies at the sight of a rope.
Inner groups, whether Labor or anti-
Labor, can’t be hanged.
Elaborating his argument, the vice-
president said:
Inside Parliament, if there were non-
party voting and if every member voted
in accordance with his opinion—perhaps
crude and ill-informed —Parliamentary
government of the British type could not
go on —perpetual uncertainty and the weak-
ness of the executive would be a greater
evil than the subordination to his party of
a member’s views on minor matters.
If this is true, why waste money on
crude-minded members who periodi-
cally increase their salaries? Obviously
a non-quarrelling executive directly re-
sponsible to the electors would be less
expensive and less trammelled in opera-
tion than warring sections of automata
who have freedom in nothing but abuse.
The fact is, the party system has out-
lived its usefulness. Parties originally
represented widely divergent principles.
In the last century or less there have been
so many thefts of policies, and so much
apostasy, that they have become point-
less. Party and principle have almost
completely ceased to live together.
The Lang party and the U.A.P. were so
narrowly divided in essentials a couple
of years ago that the possibility was
openly discussed in U.A.P. circles of
“persuading” some Langites to transfer
their allegiance from the Trades Hall to
the National Club. The Scullinites, who
profess to abhor everything that Lang
stands for, are working to heal the
breach with him, and one day they may
serve under him. On the other hand,
they don’t differ so widely from their
Government enemies that a pact would be
impossible if Lang became strong enough
to threaten their corporate existence.
One of the tests of any system of gov-
ernment is its ability to face a crisis,
and in every crisis in the past few years
the party system has failed. Even the
democratic U.S.A. is under a quasi-
dictatorship. In Britain, both the war
and the depression threw together sec-
tions which had to abandon partyism to
save the country. In Australia, when the
war began, Liberals and Laborites,
Socialists and anti-Socialists, bridged
what had always been considered an
unbridgable gulf in order to carry on
hostilities. As a result of the depres-
sion South Africa’s Opposition has been
nearly wiped out by the formation of a
united Administration, and in Ulster a
broadcasting amplifier is needed to make
audible the whisper of the forlorn rem-
nant which sits opposite the national
Government. In Newfoundland inter-
party warfare has ceased, and so has
Parliament.
The abolition of the party system
would cause no heartburning in Aus-
tralia except among a few professional
politicians. It has brought Parliament and
politicians into such disrepute in the past
couple of decades that the average Aus-
tralian thinks of them as a convention
of self-seekers, and speaks of them with
scorn. The dailies which once starred
the Parliamentary notes and reported
political speakers verbatim now feature
little but the politicians’ quarrels and
epithets. Individual electorates mostly
regard their representatives as messengers
to convey requests for new post offices
and railway sidings, while party leaders
look on members as so many heads to
be counted when occasion demands.
Such a system saps individuality, and
leaves a large proportion of men of
ability who enter Parliament too seized
with the futility of the business to take
an active part in Parliamentary affairs.
And it deters many desirable candidates
from offering themselves. It was bad
enough when majority rule obtained in
party meetings, but in these days even
majorities within parties don’t always
count. The endorsement pledge hangs
round the member’s neck; threats of
ostracism, expulsion, or a sudden appeal
to the electors override his convictions
or appeal to his sense of self-preservation.
The caucus system, as practised in
Australia, is the biggest curse that has
struck the country since prickly-pear was
introduced, and any political scientist
who can breed a Cactoblastis which will
destroy it and establish a scheme under
which members can co-operate instead
of feeling bound to behave toward one
another like distemper-stricken wolves
will deserve an enduring monument.
THE GROSS IGNORANCE OF
SENATOR PEARCE.
Last week the Minister for Defence
(Senator Pearce) sent a statement regard-
ing the Defence Department’s treatment
of Lieut.-Commander Alan Casey,
R.A.N., for publication in The Bulletin.
To those acquainted with the facts on
record and the naval regulations, almost
every one of the seven paragraphs which
comprised the statement carried its own
refutation. Consider them.
Paras. (1) and (2), which mentioned
that the Lieut.-Commander “had to be
relieved of his appointment,” and
brought forward for medical surveys,
“conducted by three naval medical
officers,” omitted to mention that after
the second survey in October, 1933, the
medical officers reported that he had
“entirely recovered”
Para. (4) stated:
As the officer was below the naval physi-
cal standard, and not available for general
service, the naval regulations required that
his appointment be terminated, and he was
discharged four months after he had
reported sick.
There is no such thing as a “naval phy-
sical standard.” The physical standard in
the R.A.N. —as was the case in the A.1.F.,
and as is the case in every combatant
arm —is determined from time to time
as regards serving members by medical
boards. In this case the board had re-
ported favorably.
Far from being “not available for gen-
eral service” the Lieut.-Commander, just
previously to his last medical survey, had
carried out general service duties in the
Penguin for three months to the “entire
satisfaction” of his C.O. A signed certi-
ficate to this effect, signed by the C.O.
H.M.A.S. Penguin, was, and is, available.
It is true that the Lieut.-Commander
was “discharged four months after he
had reported sick.” What Para. (4) re-
frains from saying is that he was dis-
charged two weeks after his second and
last medical board had reported him
“entirely recovered.”
Para. (5) says:
There is no justification for the charge in
The Bulletin article that the discharge of
this officer was due to political economis-
ing, nor for the attack on civilians in the
Defence Department. The case was purely
a naval one and dealt with throughout by
naval officers.
And Para. (7) emphasises that as the Lieut.-
Commander got his deferred pay “the
facts do not disclose any niggardliness.”
Under “Naval Financial Regulations
and Instructions” (Chap. V., Art. 127) the
Naval Board is authorised to pay com-
pensation to one who is retired through
“disease not due to the member’s de-
fault,” and Art. 128 goes on:
Compensation shall be assessed by the
Naval Board after consideration of the
report of the medical board which surveys
a member of the Permanent Naval Forces
and recommends his invaliding.
But no medical board recommended the
invaliding of Lieut.-Commander Casey.
On the. contrary, the board which sur-
veyed him a fortnight prior to his abrupt
dismissal agreed with the Macquarie-
street specialist who, on instructions
from the Defence Department, had
already suveyed him, and with his C.O.
on H.M.A.S. Penguin, that he was “en-
tirely recovered.” Having been kicked
out, as he was, the officer obviously had
no claim to compensation under the re-
gulations. For the best of reasons, the
Naval Board was not in a position to
assess what was due to him by reference
to any Medical Board. So he got no-
thing but his deferred pay, which, as
the phrase indicates, consisted of his
own earnings.
It was as though a Digger had been
court-martialled at the Front, acquitted,
and informed two weeks later that he
had been convicted and dismissed the ser-
vice, with resulting disabilities, by some
anonymous and irresponsible person at a
Base.
If this was not what the statement
fathered by the Minister for Defence
called “political economising” (Para. 5)
and “niggardliness on the part of the
Government” (Para. 7), then it was some-
thing infinitely worse. The Bulletin
submits that it was a little of both. One
of the most impudent misrepresentations
in the whole of the Department’s apologia
appeared in Para. (5): “The case was
purely a naval one and dealt with
throughout by naval officers.” The fact
is no matter of any importance in the
shore establishments is “dealt with
throughout by naval officers.” The hand
of the Finance Branch, which is exclu-
sively civilian, is in everything. And some
of the civilians, as The Bulletin has re-
marked before, don’t like the sailors.
Anyhow, whether sailor or civilian was
responsible, the indisputable fact stands
out that a brilliant young officer was
irregularly ousted from the R.A.N. and
irregularly deprived of his compensation
money. Nothing can be done for him ;
he is dead. But what happened to him
may happen to any other member of the
Service. Is Senator Pearce going to let
himself be hoodwinked by another De-
partmental statement lightly explaining
away the truth? Or will he do his duty
by the R.A.N. and Australia; go into
the matter in a serious vein, and see that
those to blame are given no further
chance to victimise seagoing ranks and
ratings?
ARTISTS, BANKERS AND
MAJOR DOUGLAS.
Dear Bulletin, —An engineer by pro-
fession, I don’t profess to be a com-
petent critic of art or economics. I
haven’t been able to spare the time from
my exigent calling to make an adequate
study of these tremendous subjects. Yet
they interest me. Like others in the same
position, I am constantly striving after
truths regarding them, and I can only
hope to succeed by a system of trial and
error.
In art I have always relied, in the last
resort, on artists, and they haven’t let me
down. Not that all artists agree on all
points ; but the best always seem to agree
after a while on what may be called the
key points.
When I was in London a few years
ago Epstein was holding an exhibition at
the Leicester Galleries ; and the art critics
of the chief British newspapers and
thousands of amateur critics were laugh-
ing at him. I went to the exhibition with
my banker, and his scorn as we stood
before the figure of the Saviour was im-
pressive. However, he is a kindly old
soul, and he ended by condoning the
outrage on the ground that Epstein,
apart from being a Boche Jew, was
notoriously “a bit touched.” I agreed,
as nearly all the other business and pro-
fessional people of my acquaintance—
and every journalist without exception—
were talking in the same strain.
They told me of the dastardly trick by
which the King had been diddled into
allowing Epstein’s “Rima” into the Hyde
Park bird sanctuary and other stories
to the Jewish mountebank’s discredit.
Then I met one of France’s greatest
sculptors. He said that my friends and
the art critics of the newspapers were
wrong; that Epstein was a genius. In
the Chelsea Arts Club and elsewhere I
kept meeting eminent sculptors and
painters who agreed. So I readjusted my
views, as I would have if a committee
of specialists had told me that, say, a
growth on my hand which had been
diagnosed by a chemist as nothing was
sarcoma.
I am in the same position as regards
the Douglas Credit scheme. I was given
a fairly good education, but it didn’t
include economics any more than it did
art. In matters of high finance I am as
much dependent on money-experts as I
am on the dentist when a tooth goes
wrong.
By a species of poetic justice it is now
the bankers who are the Hebrew trick-
sters. Things are being said about them
by journalists and others who believe in
the Douglas Credit scheme that make
the insults hurled at Epstein by my Lon-
don banker sound mild in retrospect.
Get Will Dyson’s “Artist Among the
Bankers” if you want to realise the de-
gree of loathing to which a Douglas
Crediter is inspired by the thought of
bankers.
When Major Douglas was in Sydney
the other day he said that, if given a
free hand by the Government, he “would
undertake to banish unemployment inside
six months.” Also supply everybody
with £3OO a year. Obviously, if Doug-
lasism can do such things, it is a greater
potential happiness-bringer than all the
humanitarian legislation that was ever
passed or thought of, and than any
religion. It is capable, among other
blessings, of abolishing slums, mal-
nutrition and its attendant evils, and the
neuroses of fatigue and anxiety; of
diminishing crime almost to vanishing
point; and of emptying most of the
gaols and asylums. The bankers are said
to be the stumbling-blocks. By reason
of their determination to continue bat-
tening on the workers —or whoever
bankers do batten on—this relief is be-
ing denied to mankind. The bankers
manage it by “influence” —just as Epstein
was supposed to be selling his mon-
strosities, ten years ago, by getting
fellow-Jews and -Germans to work the
oracle for him.
Somehow it didn’t sound right.
Plainly the people to go to for an opinion
were not bankers, who might be biased,
nor journalists, nor artists, who have had
little experience of intricate economic
problems as a rule and no specialist-
training in finance. The natural authori-
ties were scientists. Men who had
devoted as much time, energy and ability
to money and allied questions as a suc-
cessful sculptor or painter has to art;
as a successful doctor or dentist has to
his profession.
They agreed without exception that
Douglasism was rubbish. They pointed
out that, though the Major’s scheme
had been before the world for the
past fifteen years, while for the
past five years all the civilised countries
have been preoccupied with economic
problems, yet no Government had so
much as discussed it as a means of
dealing with unemployment. Hitler, who
hasn’t hesitated to defy the Lutheran
and Catholic Churches in Germany,
wouldn’t have hesitated to defy the
bankers of Germany, and implement
Douglasism. Mussblini wouldn’t have
been afraid of it, either. It hasn’t been so
much as mentioned in connection with
Roosevelt’s recovery campaign. The
French, who, after the Americans, are
the most adventurous financiers, and the
British, who are the most conservative,
agree here: they won’t have anything to
do with Douglasism. If a discredited
British politician—Lloyd George or
Mosley or, for that matter, Harry
Pollitt or the revolutionary Saklatvala —
adopted Douglasism as a policy, and
proved that it was a cure for unemploy-
ment, he would be returned to power by
the biggest majority in history. He could
rely on getting help from the best foreign
brains if only because the success of the
scheme in England would mean pros-
perity later for other countries. The
internationalist Einstein would abandon
physics for nobler work. Caillaux,
who is supposed, now that Poincare has
gone, to have the most practical economic
brain in France, would cross the Channel
and take the stump. So would his oppo-
site numbers in Germany, Greece, Rus-
sia, Norway and elsewhere. Wells,
Shaw, Huxley, Gilbert Murray, Simon,
Reading and other British intellectuals
who are either national patriots or inter-
nationalists would line up on the right
side and fight like tigers to save the
world. All this would happen if many
artists were not as wrong about the
bankers now as many bankers were
about at least one artist ten years ago.
There may be something amiss with
the capitalistic system ; but the scientists
say it is utterly unscientific to claim that
the A + B theorem can prove anything
in this or any other connection. Accord-
ing to them, a Douglas or Marx equation
is incapable of proof. A paral-
lel is “3 = 1” as an expression of
Christian doctrine. Acceptance of the
Douglas religion calls for a preliminary
act of faith which the scientists are not
prepared to make.
So the Major tours the world unsup-
ported by any of the men and women
whose support would give his faith the
prestige it needs. After all these years
his only apostles are the weak of head.
If Epstein, after exhibiting the works of
his maturity for as long, had won no
disciples from the ranks of his peers, but
only hordes of young or youngish
amateurs without serious pretensions to
intelligence and education, then it would
surely mean that there was nothing in his
work. A sure proof that there is nothing
in the Douglas religion is the fact that
among the hundreds of thousands who
have been converted to it there isn’t a
single first-class mind. Yours etc.,
COLONEL BOGAS.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Restriction Means Ruin.
The fact that Prime Minister Lyons has
sunk his prejudices sufficiently to invite
Dr. Earle Page and other C.P. leaders
to participate in the heavily-censored
conference at Canberra indicates that a
grave position is being faced. And if it
is grave, then the Government shouldn’t
commit itself without a mandate from
the country.
Mr. Bruce is reported to have said that
secondary industries restrict their produc-
tion when there is a market shortage.
But this is very different from restrict-
ing primary products. Farm land can’t
be placed in oil, and, in any event, in-
terest charges play a bigger part in the
farmer’s economy than they do in that
of the manufacturer. Stock can’t be
oiled down either. Breeding must go
on. The only restriction which is pos-
sible in the mutton and beef industries
would be through culling and the insti-
tution of a quicker turnover for the pro-
duction of baby beef and lamb instead
of bullock beef and old mutton.
Moreover, voluntary constriction of
production by individuals to meet the
laws of supply and demand is entirely
different from compulsory nationalised
restriction. Let Mr. Lyons prescribe re-
strictions for manufacturers and see
what happens. Every union, every maker
of goods will be up in arms, and at the
next election the industrial vote will pitch
him out of public life for ever.
Restriction is unnecessary in primary
production whatever weak-kneed Gov-
ernments may say. Nobody talks of
restricting wool, because Australian
genius has made it the best wool in the
world, and it is indispensable to Con-
tinental industries. There is no reason
why our wheat and meat shouldn’t
achieve the same position. Already some
of our white milling wheats are in such
favor that British millers can’t do with-
out them. Cost competition is also a
factor. The meat industry in Australia
should be able to underbid that of other
countries with equal quality meat. But
it can’t while the business is weighed
down with crushing taxation, and while
it uses two acres and four animals to
produce in four years what could be
produced on one acre by two animals in
two years under modern methods and
standards, as practised in the Argentine.
♦
Alleged Thunder-pinching in
Tasmania.
The Tasmanian elections are not due till
June, and Premier Lee’s policy pro-
nouncement was not expected to be heard
in the land until about mid-May. But
a speech which was broadcast recently
by Opposition-leader Ogilvie, K.C., indi-
cates that the stadium doors are already
open, so to speak.
Labor will ask the electors to approve
of a £1,500,000 public-works scheme
which is calculated to absorb the unem-
ployed within six months. It includes
the harnessing of Lake St. Clair and
other waterways so as to add 80,000
e.h.p. to the Hydro-Electric Commis-
sion’s present 66,000, and the extension
of power and light transmission lines to
almost every part of the island. Among
the items listed are a 14-mile canal and
a 27-mile pipe-line to provide Hobart and
a long string of droughty villages with
a domestic water supply and irrigation
facilities. The feasibility of the proposal
is vouched for by the engineers of the
Hydro-Electric Commission, and it is
understood that the Commissioners are
prepared to accept the responsibility and
go ahead with the job directly Parlia-
ment provides for the raising of the
money.
It looks the sort of proposal that might
be considered apart from partyism. How-
ever, Labor supporters point out that
if the electors return Lee they may
be sure that the proposal will be
ignored. Reasons: (1) The Nats, are
manacled to the Premiers’ Plan, which
is against public-works expenditure be-
yond the barest requirements of unem-
ployment relief on a dole-wage basis;
(2) the Premier himself has been a
declared and consistent opponent of
the State-owned hydro-electric from the
beginning.
As against this, no sooner had Ogilvie
announced his policy than Walter Lee
informed the press that his Government
had had a similar scheme under con-
sideration for some time, and that it was
like Mr. Ogilvie’s impudence to claim it
for Labor.

Bodyline and Bellona.
“B”: This eternal bodyline row proves
the futility of disarmament conferences if
nothing else. Many men love to take
risks, and practically everybody loves
seeing others take risks. That is why mil-
lions of men threw up safe jobs to enlist
in the last war while other millions en-
couraged them to do so with white
feathers and the like.
The bodyline controversialists are
divided into pacifists and warmongers,
just like the disarmament controversial-
ists. If the pacifists win, then so much
the worse for cricket. The vast majority
of cricket fans want excitement, and as
much of it as possible. Larwood was the
best draw a cricket ground has seen in
years just because he obviously endan-
gered his opponents’ lives.
The pacifists who talk about the com-
plete abolition of war are not only suffer-
ing under a delusion, but are just as great
a danger as the wholehearted warmonger.
War will never be eliminated, because
it is rooted in human biology. This isn’t
to say that war as we know it provides
the only outlet possible. It is probably
one of the least desirable and most ineffi-
cient. The Russians went to war gladly
enough, but after a year or so they were
sick of it. Their craving for peace be-
came so great that the Czar lost his head
and Kerensky his job through ignoring
it. The peace-desiring army then went
home, but promptly proceeded to make
war on the landowners, the intellectuals
and the aristocracy. They are now mak-
ing war on Nature, in the form of Plans,
concerning which they use such phrases
as “The Wheat Front,” “The Tractor
Front,” “Shock Brigadiers Against Illi-
teracy” and so on —all good military
phrases. They are getting so much excite-
ment and adventure out of this war at
present that they view the prospect of a
physical war against Japan with strong
displeasure. If the Plans fail, it will, of
course, be a different story.
It amounts to this, then, that war is
a crude expression of a valuable instinct.
An ideal nation of philosophers, scien-
tists and artists would presumably not
want to crack the heads of another
nation similarly constituted. It would get
more pleasure out of convincing them.
Unfortunately philosophers are in a min-
ority in every nation. Moreover, they are
seldom to be found in the seats of the
mighty, especially in democracies. So,
though some of the causes of war
could be removed immediately, they will
continue to occur, and the best we can
do is to refuse to be deluded alike by the
arguments supplied by the warmongers
for fighting them and by the arguments
of the pacifists that they are contrary to
human nature.

Aeroplane Switches and Safety.
“Bert the Carpenter”: The owner of
a light ’plane recently took me up in a
test flight. Before leaving the ground he
warned me not to knock the key of the
dual-control ignition switch. “It can be
done very simply,” he explained. “I
was taking a friend to a race-meeting last
year and he switched the engine off acci-
dentally when we were over some thick
forest. Our chances seemed blue for a
time. Later a passenger did the same
thing with a club machine, and the pilot
had to make a forced landing in a street
at Glenelg. Two years ago a man was
flying low around an incoming mail
steamer at Port Adelaide and exactly the
same thing happened. In his case the
’plane went to the bottom of the sea and
is there still. The two men in it were
lucky to escape alive. There have been
other cases.”
I naturally wanted to know why, in
the name of commonsense, any ’plane is
allowed to leave the factory with switches
that can be knocked off so easily. With
some sheet-brass we there and then made
collars for both switches, so that they
couldn’t be switched off except by put-
ting a finger inside the collar. It makes
one wonder how many otherwise inex-
plicable crashes these open switches have
caused. I suggest that every ’plane be
declared unairworthy until a simple little
guard has been fitted over the ignition
switch.

The Gilded Morgues of Sydney.
Twelve years ago J. T. Lang laid the
foundation-stone of the N. S. Wales
Government Savings Bank on one of the
most expensive sites in Australia. Above
it, in course of time, rose a gaudy edifice
which cost three-quarters of a million
pounds and resembled a profiteer’s wife
abroad “with everything on.” Only a
couple of storeys of the palace were
needed for banking business, and that
not for long. Under the last Lang
regime the bank went broke; nobody
would rent the ground floor, and it was
handed over to Mr. Whiddon and his
lottery queues. The queues becoming a
nuisance, a scandal and an obstruction
to the traffic, the Stevens Government
gave Whiddon notice to quit and hired
the premises of a defunct softgoods
house for him. The bank reopened on
the ground floor, and efforts were made
to let other parts of the monstrous place
to private tenants.
Then another activity came into the
limelight—the Rural Bank. This organi-
sation, which had its habitat for years
in a fair-sized building in Barrack-street,
is said to need a new home. Economy
would suggest that it should occupy a
few of the spare acres in the Castlereagh-
street extravaganza. Not so. It is too
proud. So a couple of hundred thousand
is to be laid out for it on another picked
site in Martin-place.
The Railway Commissioners, too, need
a new building. Their clerks, one would
imagine, could well continue to do their
work in the unfashionable end of
Castlereagh-street or at the Central
Station. But this would not be good
for their self-esteem, so they are to be
moved to another edifice on one of
the most expensive natural hotel sites
in Sydney—that is, over Wynyard station.
Sydney soon will consist of a wide
circle of towering monuments to official
extravagance, with a few meek ware-
houses sandwiched in between. The
number of big commercial houses whose
premises run into six figures in Sydney
is limited, but no tin-pot department will
live in anything worth under a quarter
of a million these days. After all, what’s
a quarter of a million beside the cost of
the Harbor Bridge?

Obstacles to Virtue.
The other day a constable walked into
a lane in South Melbourne and tried to
arrest two men who were taking bets.
He was assaulted, and the usual fines
followed, accompanied by the customary
strictures from the Bench on the un-
ethical conduct of citizens who don’t
rush to the help of policemen when the
latter are trying to rid the community of
pests. But where are the ethics and
who are the pests in this connection?
The position is so muddled that sym-
pathy is diverted from the unfortunate
police, who, as often as they try to do
their duty, are made to appear class-
biased narks.
It is ethical for a Melbourneite to go on
to a racecourse and entrust his money to
a registered bookie or put it on a tote.
If he can afford the subscriptions, it is
ethical for him to lose his money in the
environs of the lawn at Flemington, one
of the most famous quarter-acres in
Christendom. It is also ethical for him
to gamble in the Melbourne Club. It is
unethical for him to take a ticket in
Tatt.’s, but it is ethical for the Govern-
ment to take a proportion of his prize if
he wins. It is ethical for him to gamble
on the Stock Exchange or in an “Obsti-
nate Artist” contest. It is unethical to
take part in a lottery in his own State,
but ethical if the lottery is in another
State. In the case of Chinese it is ethical
to gamble on the flat but not in Little
Bourke-street.
To take the matter into other fields, it
is ethical to have a drink before six
on licensed premises, but unethical to do
so after that hour in the same place.
It is unethical to infringe the regulations
governing bathing costumes and behavior
on the beaches, but it is ethical for the
councils to allow their own regulations to
be broken, lest bathers should desert their
municipalities and go where they will
be treated with more leniency. It is un-
ethical to hold up the traffic and carry
improper or other symbols in proces-
sion through the streets, except in the
case of university students, when it be-
comes ethical.
A result of it all is that the citizen
doesn’t believe that a large number of
the offences for which he can be
punished are offences at all. The recent
hostility of the South Melbourne mob to
the anti-betting policeman is a reflection
of every citizen’s vague hostility to all con-
stituted authority. The citizen feels that
the world is a maze through which it is
difficult to steer a straight course. He
is the sport of forces beyond his control,
and the knowledge that this is so keeps
him in a ferment of irritation. In prac-
tice it is impossible for a citizen of
Melbourne to be genuinely ethical. Yet
nearly every citizen wants to be.

Process Work.
Arthur Griffith: Many advocates of
unemployed-relief schemes place the sole
blame for the world’s troubles on inven-
tions. They may be right. Further, there
is an aspect of the case which they
haven’t so far dealt with.
Few besides those employed on repeti-
tion work realise its blasting effects. To
satisfy my curiosity, I once got a job as
a “driller” at one of Sydney’s largest fac-
tories. I gave it up in disgust inside two
months. Men fully qualified for the
technical trades are employed as pro-
cess workers, the main reason being
that they are paid less. Process
workers have to stand on the same spot,
day in and day out, and never converse
with their neighbors concerning the work
in hand. All inquiries must be addressed
to the foreman as he does his rounds.
Eventually a process worker develops
into an automaton as like his machine
as possible. He often confines himself to
monosyllables: Eh? What? Oke and so on.
Intensive study when a period of process
work has been completed is impossible.
The brain has been dulled. The machine
sets the pace, and the pace must be kept
to the detriment of following generations.
With tasks such as placing nuts and
bolts in place, stamping rivets in one
sweep of the hand, drilling and tapping
in one operation—and every repetition
task is almost as simple—the inevitable
result must be to develop a populace of
two classes. Process workers on the one
hand (representing the non-thinkers), the
technicians and inventors in the other
camp. It may be said that this has hap-
pened already. To an extent it has. But
we still have men working at simple
trades with the will-power to overcome
their stifling effects. They have not been
doing repetition jobs all their lives. What
of those of the future who are born into
process work?
♦
Clear as Mud.
The Federal Arbitration Court has re-
stored the 10 p.c. emergency reductions
in skill margins made in 1931. But this
by no means signifies that the benefi-
ciaries will get a 10 p.c. increase. The
“well-known Powers 35.” has been abol-
ished, and there have been various other
manipulations. Any working man who
has taken first-class honors at his uni-
versity in pure mathematics, and who
owns an engineer’s slide rule and a table
of extended logarithms, can work out
for himself why the 7d. extra in Sydney
and the 6s. 9d. extra in Perth which the
Court has given him aren’t 7d. and 6s.
9d. at all.
As Mr. D. T. Sawkins, statist to the
N.S.W. Industrial Commission, very suc-
cinctly put it:
The Federal Court has really not dis-
carded the basic wage of £3 6s. 5d., which
would have operated from May 1, but
has rounded it off to £3 7s. This is a new
starting point for future calculations. So
far as the basic wage is concerned, the 10
per cent, by which wages were reduced
has not been restored. By the process of
rounding off to the shilling, the Court has,
in the case of Sydney, restored 7d. of the
cut. The real restoration of the 10 per
cent, takes place in the margin above the
basic wage for skilled men.
Almost every section is dissatisfied. The
secretary of the Postal Workers declared
that “only a Philadelphia lawyer could
understand the judgment.” The N.S.W.
Manufacturers’ president said it would
“depress industry,” and the Ironworkers’
spokesman opined that its effect would
be to “seal the doom of the Court.”
To quote Sydney “Sun”:
Many unions will consider at their next
general meetings the question of with-
drawing from the Arbitration Court. One
union secretary said that he would advo-
cate the establishment of Commonwealth
Wages Boards as a substitute for the
Court.
In short, instead of bringing content-
ment in its wake, the award has provided
more fuel for the class struggle, and has
intensified the country’s contempt for the
arbitration system. As The Bulletin
has said again and again, it is time the
whole expensive box of tricks was aban-
doned in favor of a more human and
flexible method of getting employer and
employee together.

A Lesson from Europe.
Four thousand workmen of Bologna
have offered to give an hour’s toil
apiece towards the construction of one
of Mussolini’s national buildings in the
Via dell’ Impero at Rome. Not long ago
the Italian Government was deluged with
applications from enthusiasts who waited
to lend helping hands on similar
terms to the erection of another edifice.
It has often happened in Europe. Many
a mediaeval cathedral rose into the sky
under the hands of honorary quarrymen
and masons, and in a more modern age
the workers on the job constructed and
laid the marvellous tessellated floor of
the Stockholm Town Hall from scraps
which they had saved from the builders’
dumps.
In Australia we don’t do that kind of
thing. Hence, to complete the Anzac
Memorial in Sydney it was necessary for
R.S.S.I.L. officials to stump the country
begging citizens to buy stars in the dome
to pay wages and buy material. There
are many things we can learn from the
Old World. Among them are faith, en-
thusiasm for worthy institutions, public
spirit.
How much it would have added to
the value of the Sydney and Melbourne
shrines if they had been built, even in
part, by the volunteer labor of citizens.

“Lao-dah”: Probably the most pon-
derous exchange of courtesies in Aus-
tralian history will be completed shortly.
One thousand cases containing the stones
of Captain Cook’s so-called home at
Great Ayton, Yorkshire, were lately
unloaded from the Port Dunedin at Mel-
bourne, and presently 20 tons of granite
quarried from Cape Everard, the first
piece of Victoria to be spotted by the
navigator, will leave for Great Ayton.

Cape Everard obelisk. The whole cost
of this inter-imperial exchange of billets-
doux will be borne by Russell Gn—wade.

“Norroy”: l am glaa to see
that the kangaroo has at last
received recognition as a
heraldic beast. He has already
appeared, of course, as a sup-
porter in coats-of-arms and on
our coinage, but always with a
bald and unimpressive outline.
All who know the animal king-
dom of the heralds will bear me
out when I mention that the
lions, leopards and other furred
beasts have their outlines varied
at certain points by attractive
little curlicues they are
“crined,” in heraldic lingo.
Writer has just received a book-
let concerning the Australian
Eleven from the Orient Co. On
the front page is a coat-of-arms,
with the vase for the inevitable
ashes as the charge. Supporting
this are the lion and the kan-
garoo. The lion is tufted in the
customary fashion. The kan-
garoo has been endued with an
elaborate hair fringe between
the top of the thigh and the
bend of the hock. The addition
makes Macropus look as if he
was wearing a tattered pair of
plus-fours, but still it is a start.
“Ledburian”: “Colley C.” is right in
his belief that Masefield was born in
Hereford and not in Liverpool, as
the “Age” suggested (B. 18/4/’34).
His forebears have for generations been
well known and prosperous legal folk in
the ancient market town of Ledbury.
Strange how the legend persists that the
future Laureate “ran away to sea,” a
step he had no occasion to take ; he was
left an orphan while very young, and
his uncles, who were his guardians, find-

fession, sent him to the training-ship
Conway Some years later he did run
away but it was from the sea. He then

“Norbell” • For masterly condensation
a recent contents bill of Sydney’s even-
ing newspaper would take some beating:
RAZOR SLASHED
TWO WOMEN
TERRIBLE WOUNDS
ULM AGAIN
It recalls the quaint conjunction of items
MARK TWAIN ARRIVES

which made London laugh some 40
years ago.
“Do you find it cheaper to do your own cooking?”
“Much. Since I started Fred practically eats nothing.”
“A. Clue”: In a Brisbane court the
other day a man was charged with hav-
ing stolen property in his posses-
sion. Said property consisted of
five shillings, which, according to
the prosecution, was part of the
silver received for a pound-note
stolen by a boy, who had told the
accused that he had stolen it. For
the defence a smart point was
taken, viz., that the silver was not
the actual money stolen. In sup-
port of this contention counsel
cited the case of Rex v. James
Walkley, which was decided about
100 years ago, and, never having
been upset, remains sound law. His
Honor sustained the point and the
accused was discharged.
* * * *
“Exdig”: I haven’t any time for
the sweeping claim that the Aus-
tralians were the best troops o£
the Western Front (B. 11/4/’34)';
still it would be hard to rebut the
argument that collectively they
were considered the best by the
brass-hats principally concerned,
since all the Australian divisions
were included as shock troops, an
honor shared by no other Domi-
nion troops. As a matter of fact,
the individual pride of place was
given by Fritz himself, according
to orders of General von Arnheim
which were found on prisoners, to
the 51st Highland Division. Von
Arnheim described it as the best
division in attack or defence the
Germans had to meet on any front.
One Australian division and one
Canadian were bracketed with the
51st in another order of the same
general. It was the 51st which took
Beaumont Hamel on a foggy morn-
ing with the bayonet, without the
help of guns. After the Somme
they saw more service, probably,
than any other single division. The
51st and other crack English divi-
sions were kept up, however, by drafts
of the best men from other British regi-
ments, which suffered correspondingly.
They were picked men ; and it is worth
recalling that, without being in that cate-
gory, the Diggers in the bulk were ranked
on much the same level.

“Morimoto”: A great deal of nonsense
was talked about the suicide of Satoh
being a demonstration of the Samurai
spirit. In a letter to his fiancee
the tennis champion definitely stated
that he was sick in the stomach
and confused in the head and that what
he was going to do was cowardly, but
unavoidable. Hara-kiri in the Samurai
sense is not performed to escape per-
snnal suffering but to preserve the honor
of or benefit the nation, which is, of
course, tne God-Lmperor. Thousands ot
suicides like Satoh s occur every year in
Nippon owing to jealousy, disappoint-
ment, inability to marry the beloved, and
so f or th. They take the forms of jump-
ing over cliffs, stepping in front of trains
and various modern improvements culled
from the movies. These events are
reported in the press precisely as similar
events are in Australia. The sacrifice of
one’s life for the Emperor, which should
be performed with elaborate rites and in
a prescribed manner, is a rare occurrence.

“Fakarava”: What looks like a bad
case of leg-pulling cropped up in Syd-
ney last week when a morning news-
paper streamer-headed a wonderful yarn
about more than £10,000,000 worth of
gold having been as good as located by
a party in the “Tuamoto” Archipelago.
The stuff, one gathered, was in heavy
wedges, and was undoubtedly Inca gold
which had been acquired by pirates and
buried there, or was part of the cargo
of a wrecked Spanish treasure galleon
bound from Panama to the Philippines.
There was a lot more meticulous detail,
but in the end it all proved as inaccu-
rate as the paper’s rendering of the Pau-
motu, or Dangerous, Archipelago as
“Tuamoto.” The scoop grew out of a
remark dropped by a Sydney citizen who
said he had received a letter from a friend
in Tahiti telling how a party searching
for treasure had been mysteriously busy
in Paurriotuan waters of late. All the
rest of the guff is just what sensational
journalism would call “intelligent anti-
cipation.”

“Mells”: Optimists of the Australian
underworld who appeal against sentences
often get unpleasant surprises. None,
however, has yet had such a devastating
experience as the French swindler who
recently challenged a sentence of ten
years’ imprisonment and was handed
thirty! The appellant had thoughtfully
provided himself with a razor, which en-
abled him to cut his throat on the spot.
The incident will serve to deepen the
impression that to exercise the right of
appeal in criminal cases may be uncom-
monly risky. Except, of course, in the
case of a convicted and condemned mur-
derer.

“Findy”: A loose carpet had brought
disaster to several plates of soup at last
week’s N.S.W. police banquet, when a
resourceful waiter came to the rescue
with hammer and tacks. The orchestra
was just then going its hardest in the
latest Neo-American symphony, but
nevertheless the first few blows of the
hammer rang out clearly. Rising to the
occasion, the waiter adapted his taps to
the rhythm of the orchestra, providing a
really striking tympanic effect. His
unrehearsed effort was one of the best
items of the evening.
ON THE NULLARBOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Complaints are made by disappointed travellers
of the ‘lying publicity matter’ contained in the
Government brochure on the Trans, railway. The
cover depicts ani aborigine in full war-paint, and
there are of blowholes and caves
on the Nullarbor VMain.”
It may possibly entangle your affections
By a certain savage beauty of its own,
Like various other territorial sections
That devastating man has left alone.
You may even feel a mild exhilaration
As through these far-flung blucbush wastes
you cruise,
Or stretch your clothes-pegs at some wayside
station
Named after Reid or Barton, Cook or
Hughes.
But if you’re bent on seeing sable warriors
l fear you will have paid your fare in vain;
There are places you might find them,
Shield before and spear behind them,
But it isn’t on the Great Nullarbor Plain.
No dusky Ajax standing mute and pensive,
No Mars in ebony will meet your eyes.
Why do departments father such offensive
Suggestio falsi, or, in English, lies?
You’ll see but little to recall the natives,
Those hefty braves from whom we stole their
land.
Save, cadging on the sidings, ragged caitiffs,
Poor suppliants of the “gibbit tickpen” brand!
They will whine and scratch, like Naples
lazzaroni,
While you watch them, full of pity, from
the train,
And feel acute misgiving
If the dingoes make a living,
Or the lizards, on the Great Nullarbor Plain.
Caves there may be, fantastic and entrancing,
Somewhere between the railway and the
Bight,
And blowholes that would set a tourist dancing
With keen and irrepressible delight.
In short, there may be various extranea
Would stir a Buddhist monk from out his
phlegm,
But they might just as well be in Tasmania
Or Borneo—for all you see of them.
Oh, it’s fine to read about them in the guide-
books
And the theories that scientists maintain,
But you’ll note more vivid graces,
I suspect, in kings and aces
When you’re traversing the Great Nullarbor
Plain.
You may feel your heart —and liver, too —are
lighter
When your lungs are tonicked up with desert
air;
You may think the stars are infinitely brighter
And the moon acquires unwonted lustre
there.
“A two-quid rise! Aren’t you opening your mouth pretty wide?”
“Not at all. The boss’ll give it to me to keep my mouth shut."
You’ll have little cause for grumbling or for
fretting
When, settled in a comfortable niche,
You are whirled toward the rising sun or
setting—
It obviously doesn’t matter which.
But if you’re yearning after gorgeous landscapes
And monotonous surroundings give you pain,
Then I fear you’ll find the scenic
Panorama somewhat splenic
As unrolled upon the Great Nullarbor Plain.

T. THE R.


‘Spokeshave”: The wisecracking tra-
ditionally associated with Shaw was
singularly absent from his broadcast.
Incidentally, one of the best mots asso-
ciated with G.B.S. was made at his ex-
pense and not by him. “One of these
days,” he told Mrs. Patrick Campbell
when she was rehearsing “Pygmalion,”
“you’ll have an attack of inspiration and
be a great actress.” “And one of these
days,” retorted Mrs. Campbell, “you’ll
eat a beefsteak and no woman in Eng-
land will be safe.” It is told of the same
lady that when Shaw had recited a
speech from the same play, to show her
how a Cockney flower-girl should talk,
she returned next day and delivered the
lines in a broad Irish accent.
* * * *
“C.Q.”: An exceptionally interested
listener to the Shawcast from Maoriland
was Frank Clewlow, who doctors the
dramatic side of the A.B.C.’s Victorian
programmes. Years ago, when Clewlow
was producing for the Birmingham
Rep., a tall, lean man with a spade beard
and a Machiavellian grin walked into
the empty theatre, one and a half hours
before the company was due to rehearse
a Shaw play. Clewlow was faced with
the terrifying problem of holding his
end up with a critic who bore an almost
legendary name for intellectuality. Clew-
low, however, had introduced some revo-
lutionary changes in the technique of
scene-painting, lighting and presentation
“They fit, but they're too heavy.”
“A splendid point, sir. I think you mentioned that you had unmarried
daughters.”
after a bitter fight with his superior
officers. Shaw tumbled to their value in
a second, and the time passed like
wildfire.

“Michael”: Listening to Pshaw “speak-
ing to the universe” from M.L., I noticed
that he pronounced “ridiculous” with
both “u’s” short and “isolated” as “iss-
dated.” The latter has the sanction of
the 0.E.D., but the former is one of his
own pronunciations. Apart from these
blemishes and his didactic attitude (“see
this is done before I come back
again”), his voice was very pleasant to
listen to and not at all like the “English
intoned by curates who serve suburban
vicars with uncertain pedanticism,” to
which Cosmo Hamilton, in his latest
novel, compares the accent affected by
8.8. C. announcers.

“Jobber”: We have an old chap in
this hamlet who runs the English coroner
fairly close in the matter of cigar-
smoking (B. 4/4/’34). He told me last
week that his average for many years
has been from 12 to 18 “weeds” a day.
There is one phase in smoking I would
like an opinion on, and that is what is
known among the proletariat as the
“drawback,” and among the naicer
people as inhaling. I have been a smoker
for close on 35 years, and ever since I
commenced, be it cigarette, cigar or pipe,
I regularly inhale the smoke, and, as far
as I know, it has done me no harm. I
have mentioned the matter to many in-
halers, including medical men, and we
are unanimously of the opinion that very
little pleasure is derived from smoking
unless one inhales. It is no use anyone
telling me it is bad for the lungs: I
know men in this town, old enough to
be my father, who have been inhaling
smoke for years, and they are as tough
as fencing wire. When I toiled on a
cattle station in Queensland I could in-
hale smoke from black Yankee Doodle
plug as freely as from an Abdullah
cigarette over a cup of coffee in Shep-
heard’s Hotel.

“T.P.”: Victoria’s sacred Shrine of
Remembrance is partially closed pending
some scheme to stop yahoos chiselling
their names on it. The tree in the Fitz-
roy Gardens delightfully carved for little
children as a labor of love by a woman
artist has had, after repeated hackings,
to be guarded. The decision to erect
Captain Cook’s cottage in front of the
Public Library was largely prompted by
the wish to save it from souvenir hunters.
Worried public and private gardeners
can’t prevent the nightly ripping out of
plants. Arbor-day enthusiasts suffer from
the deliberate destruction of their
cherished young trees. Stained-glass
church windows have to be guarded by
wire-netting. What’s wrong with us?

“X.S.”: Three men who were observed
coming out of a matron’s bungalow at a
private hospital in Footscray (Vic.) could
hardly have fared worse if they had tried
to burgle a professional wrestler’s resi-
dence. A nurse and the matron gave
chase. The nurse caught her man, hit
him on the solar plexus, knocked him
down with an uppercut and sat on
him. Four more nurses and two doc-
tors then arrived, and, while some of
them joined the nurse in sitting on her
victim, others hurried to the assistance
of the matron, who was severely woman-
a second marauder. When
the police arrived the whole hos-
pital staff was engaged in the sedentary
method of securing the wrongdoers.
“Aileron”: In the newspaper excite-
ment made over the special mail-carry-
ing flight of C. T. Ulm to M.L. and back,
the fact that Australia gave the world
a lead in the carrying of mails by air
just 20 years ago seems to have been
forgotten. The pilot was the famous
"I wonder why I’m getting no encores to-night.”
“You’ve got far too much on, my dear.”
Frenchman Guillaux, who came to Aus-
tralia on a stunting tour when aeroplanes
were rare birds in this country. His flight
was from Melbourne to Sydney on July
15, 1914. The ’bus was a small Bleriot
monoplane, and he got through his job
in spite of adverse weather. Guillaux
was killed in the air during the war.

“Feng-Shui”: If Dr. Khalid Shel-
drake, the English Moslem, succeeds with
his wife in sitting on
the throne of Sinkiang
for any prolonged
period he will have
achieved a bigger feat
than Rajah Brooke,
who conquered Snra-
wak practically single-
handed. Sultan Shel-
drake will have to keep
order amongst a mot-
ley crowd of 2,000,000
Islams, Buddhists and
pagans while Russia,
Tibet and China look
hungrily over his fron-
tiers, with Japan and
Britain pensively inter-
ested in the back-
ground. Brooke had
some pretty gory ex-
periences with his head-
hunting allies, but they
were tea-parties com-
pared with what has
happened when Chinese
Moslems have revolted
in the name of Allah
and his Prophet. Shel-
drake is head of the
English Moslems, who
are sufficiently influen-
tial to have moved G.
K. Chesterton to level
his furious diatribe,
“The Flying Inn,” at them. Recently the
new sultan attended a conference at
Shanghai at which were representatives
of no fewer than 8,000,000 European and
American followers of the Crescent.

name the abos. gave to tourists was
“loons.” He jumped to the conclusion
that this was an example of Binghi’s
humor, but Binghi is, before all things,
a gentleman. The word is good local
dialect.
“Bill O’C.”: I notice that one “Tut-
Tut” (B. 11/4/’34) falls heavily upon
“S.T.S.” for casually referring to T. S.
Eliot as a “much-boomed” poet, which
he assuredly is, whether the booming be
justified or not. “Eliot,” says “Tut-Tut,”
“interprets this life of ours with extra-
ordinary skill, even in its inanity and
meaninglessness.” But you can’t interpret
anything in its inanity, etc., though you
may repeat the meaninglessness as your
own, just as an inane story-teller repeats
the stale or stupid tale of another as
original. I am not suggesting that Eliot
does that; I think he does his own
inventing. A fair sample fragment:
Every street lamp that I pass
Beats like a fatalistic drum,
And through the spaces in the dark
Midnight shakes the memory j
As a madman shakes a dead geranium.
I pass over the question of why a street
lamp should behave in that way, but I
would like to know why the madman
should perform, as suggested, with a
geranium, alive or dead. Compare it
with a little thing of my own:
Every poet that I pass
Talks like a fatalistic parrot
High-sounding phrases, obscure and dark,
That test and shake the memory
As a madman shakes a living carrot.
I maintain my version has more sense
and a better rhyme, because, you see, it
had to be a geranium in Eliot’s poem in
order to make a rhyme with “drum,”
and a shocking rhyme at that.

“Jo”: The name of “Bear-grass” as
applied to Melbourne is easily elucidated
(B. 11/4/’34). In the early days the Vic-
torian capital had many names, such as
“Bearport,” “Bearheap,” “Bearbury” and
“Bearbrass.” All were variations of the
native name of the locality, which was
“Berrera” or “Bararing.” The Apple
Isle newspapers referred to it as “Glen-
elg” or “Batmania.”

“Eura”: Those M.L. optimists who
imagined moose-hunting was going to be
one of the Dominion’s tourist attractions
are reflecting pensively on the experiences
of E. J. Herrick, of Hastings, who has
just returned to civilisation from Dusky
Sound with his second moose-head, a fine
specimen weighing 801 b. It took the
sportsman, accompanied by a guide, three
weeks to secure the trophy, during which
time he travelled miles through dense
bush, slid down gorges, climbed moun-
tains and was dangled over precipices.
As moose travel alone or in pairs, and
keep well in shelter, they are exceed-
ingly hard to locate. This was Herrick’s
fourth trip, his last success being a 901 b.
head five years ago. No sport for a
poor man or a prince in a hurry.
THE LONE MOURNER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“The reduced tax on beer yielded £5,000.000
above expectations. The shrill voice of Lady Astor
was the only discordant note -when the Chancellor
of the Exchequer announced that the decline in the
consumption of beer had been arrested.”
Beer, all the country o’er,
Begins to flow once more
As in the days before
Malign disaster
Descended on the trade.
Its downward course is stayed.
And all the House hoorayed
But Lady Astor.
The Chancellor, his dues
In mind and revenues,
Beamed as he told the news,
You well may fancy.
And there was none demurred;
Naught but “Hear! Hear!” was heard
Save for the one hard word
That fell from Nancy.
The brewers ceased to quake;
The Bungs said “No mistake,
’Tis just the thing to make
Recovery faster.”
The hard-taxed Briton heaved
A sigh, as one relieved.
The only one that grieved
Was Lady Astor.
Back to his own again,
Back to his old domain,
O’ercoming stress and strain
And fate mischancy,
No more to languish lorn,
See! Old King Beer is borne.
And there is none to mourn
Excepting Nancy!

POLITICAL POINTS
A suggestion of the Income-tax Com-
mission was that taxes on wages and
salaries should be collected at sources
which would mean an instalment system
along the lines of the wages tax. The
scheme should have been adopted long
ago. It would practically eliminate de-
faulters among the employed, make the
burden easier for all, and ensure a regu-
lar flow of Treasury income each month.
Also, it should save tax forms and some
of the £490,000 p.a. which it costs to run
the Commonwealth taxation offices.
The Commonwealth Government has
done the right thing about air tenders for
the Australia-Singapore service, even if
its specifications suggested that it was
thinking in terms of bullock-waggons
instead of aeroplanes. Quantas and
Imperial Airways, the two pioneer
passenger-carrying companies of the
Empire, combine to do the job with
machines which have been specially built
for the work. Imperial Airways have
cut down the London-Singapore run to
eight days, so if the total distance is not
accomplished under the fortnight it will
be a disgrace.
Are our Communists degenerating into
crusted Tories? At a Plenum held a
few days ago they adopted the latest
resolutions of the Moscow 13th Plenum
and framed an immediate programme on
which to fight the next Federal elec-
tions. The chief planks were: Minimum
wage of £5 per week, six-hour day,
double dole and an extra day’s work for
the unemployed. One of their ex-mem-
bers, Mr. Tannock, now a Langite
M.L.C., has already plumped for a mini-
mum £5 16s. wage, and the six-hour day
has been an aspiration of the inner group
for years.
The French Cabinet is resorting to
desperate measures to reduce the annual
railways deficit of £56,000,000. Apart
from closing down over 6000 miles of
railway lines and banning all motor traf-
fic which competes with main lines, the
Government proposes to cut wages and
pensions a further 6 p.c. The French
railway employees are almost the lowest
paid in Western Europe, and that is
understood to be at least partially respon-
sible for the appalling railway smashes
which are so common in France. For
years English tourists have been flying
to and from France “for safety’s sake.”
However, the real enemy of the French
as of other railway systems is the ever-
improving motor-car. There are said to
be tens of thousands of wealthy French
people who haven’t travelled in a train
for years.
A London paper in a sympathetic
paragraph about the late Marquis of
Aberdeen referred to “Imperial and local
taxation on his properties”:
Consequently, portions of the estate had
to be sold, and the remainder transferred
to his heir for the avoidance of death
duties.
Things have come to such a pass that
when a property-owner bilks the Treas-
ury by means of a mock transfer it is
accepted in many quarters as a natural,
even commendable, action. Yet ethically
this kind of tax-dodger is in the same
class as the kind who fakes his returns.
The one takes the Government, and
through the Government his fellow-citi-
zens, down just as effectually as the
other. The only difference is that the
fake-transferror can’t be legally pro-
ceeded against, while the other variety of
faker can.
There are 48 candidates in Saturday’s
election for the 20 seats on Brisbane City
Council. Each seat carries a solatium of
£3OO. The rush for the spoil involved
in the rabbitskin-wearer’s job is being
made by three altruists. One is the pre-
sent holder of the pelt, J. W. Greene, a
Nat.-Cit. The Labor starter is A. J.
Jones, a former State Minister for Mines.
F. W. Paterson, a barrister, will make
his run as a Communist. Nine three-
cornered fights are promised—the odd
men being Independents in each case.
Otherwise the fight is Nat.-Cit. v. Labor,
the latter being confidently tipped to win
by half a dozen seats. If so, it will be
the first time the party has ruled since
Greater Brisbane came into being.
The retreat from Moscow, as represented
by Langism, proceeds at a great pace.
W. Jones, of the Clothing Trades Union,
who has been a barracker for the inner
group for six or seven years, is the latest
to join in. He suggested ip a valedictory
letter to the secretary of the Lang party
(J. J. Graves) that “those who place their
personal ambitions before the movement
should retire from the field.” It showed
FINAL DEFECTION IMPENDING.
“There have been more expulsions and defections in the Lang party in the past six
months than in any previous two years of the party’s history.”
JOCK THE CABINBOY: “Ai’ve a guid mind tae gie the big loon ma honest opeenion
of um, an’ join the rest o’ the pairrty.”
an appreciation of realities, but he is no
more likely to be listened to than a back-
seat driver would be who remonstrated
with a drunk. The University Labor
Club also decided to ditch Langism, the
grievance here being that its estate-agent
leader was a capitalist at heart, and had
no real desire to see industry socialised.
The defectionists nearly all give dif-
ferent reasons for getting out. They are
united on one point, though: all have a
lively distrust of Mr. J. T. Lang.
“D.”: When the question came up last
week of restoring to the Civil List the
£50,000 p.a. which the King sacrificed at
the beginning of the slump, it was hinted
in palace circles that he didn’t want it.
Economy adjustments in the royal palaces
had been limited to matters like drink
money and more efficient catering, and they
had proved satisfactory to everybody.
Wage- reductions had been avoided.
In other words, the King gets very little
of the large income which the nation
allows him. About 90 p.c. of it goes
on the maintenance of public museums
like Windsor Castle, or places where
Britannia entertains, so to speak, like
Buckingham Palace. If H.M. became a
private citizen to-morrow he could live
as well, in the essentials, on his family
fortune as he is living now ; and if the
nation chose a President the latter would
have to either close Hampton Court and
the rest, throw thousands on the unem-
ployed market, and sacrifice much
national dignity, amusement and culture,
or be paid as much as is now being paid
to the King.
Queensland Wheat Board, which made
such a mess of its job last year, now pro-
poses to make the 1933-34 season’s mill-
ing wheat available at rates which would
bring aggregate prices to about 3s. 2?d.
a bushel at railhead, or 3s. 4yd. landed
in Brisbane. It means that the board is
asking about 3d. per bushel more for
local wheat than millers can buy south-
ern wheat landed in Brisbane for!
Millers have firmly rejected the offer, at
the same time urging that the recom-
mendations of the recent Royal Commis-
sion which advocated the abolition of the
present board and the appointment of a
new one be at once put into effect.
Though Melbourne is rated old-
fashioned by some, its pre-selection
methods are said to be capable of giving
Sydney Trades Hall points. Thus one of
the mildest reasons given for challenging
the ballot for the Williamstown State
seat was that a scrutineer, on leaving a
booth, was taken into the front of a
car while two other men took the ballot-
box into the back. All the way from the
booth to the counting office the driver
tooted his horn —allegedly to drown the
rustle of the ballot papers. Arrived at
the counting-place, the car stopped, and
the patriots with the box bolted for the
office, leaving the scrutineer locked in
the car. Affidavits alleging enterprises
of this kind are said to be as numerous
as ballot-papers, and the ballot-papers
are understood to outnumber the elec-
tors by a substantial margin.
Melbourne Bumbles will have them-
selves to thank if General Blarney has
his way and traffic regulation is handed
over to the police. In some streets it is
illegal for motorists a pass a stationary
tram on their way to town, but legal to
do so on the way home. This is because
one side of the street is in one munici-
pality and the other side in another and
the two authorities can’t agree. There
are also differences of opinion between
the police and the City Council as to the
merits of angle parking, and a host of
other disputes make pedestrians and
drivers curse and undertakers rejoice.
Gengoult Smith is against the proposal
on the ground that the fifth city of the
Empire ought to be left to mismanage its
own affairs, but George Ramsay, presi-
dent of the R.A.C.V., says it is “one of
the soundest suggestions made for a long
time.”
“Matelot”: The Minister for Defence
wrote (B. 19/4/’34):
At the time of leaving the R.A.N. Lieut.-
Commander Casey was in receipt of £558
per annum. On retirement he drew £985
as deferred pay. These facts do not dis-
close any niggardliness on the part of the
Government.
It gave the R.A.N. a laugh, anyhow.
The truth is, like every other officer of
his seniority, he was in receipt of £476
per annum. That is what we know as
“actual pay.” The remaining £B2 per
annum went to his deferred pay account
leaving him on retirement with a credit of
£985. The Government had no more
justification for claiming absence of
“niggardliness” in handing it over than
a bank would have for making a similar
claim because it had honored a financial
depositor’s cheque.
With the civic elections due
on Saturday the Nat.-Citizens’
party, which at present controls
the Greater Brisbane Council,
has made what its backers con-
sider a bad break. It forecast a
new ordinance forbidding the
taking of foodstuffs into theatres
and other places of entertain-
ment. Flapperdom and hobble-
dehoyhood raised their voices in a united
yell of protest, and the yell was echoed
by the trades supplying the threatened
comestibles. In vain has Mayor Greene
protested that the new ordinance will
only apply to peanuts. Labor is jubi-
lantly convinced that it has the chocolate
and ice-cream vote in its bag in addi-
tion.
J. S. Garden and J. M. Martin, who
have been trying to convert the heathen
of Victoria to Langism, have met
with little success. So many of the
southern savages have retired behind the
stockades of moderation that the central
executive of the V.L.P. is now almost
equally divided on the unity question. In
Sydney the efforts of the missionaries
have made Federal Labor madder than
ever. In Queensland so little has been
heard recently of Lang’s Livingstones
that, if the “Labor Daily” were to ask
Mr. Bruce to act as its Stanley when he
goes north, it wouldn’t be entirely
inappropriate.
Those in favor of a continued high
exchange should look at this year’s Bud-
gets. Exchange payments provided" for
by the Commonwealth and the six States
total roughly £7,170,000, though reduc-
tion in interest charges on overseas debts
due to the Bruce conversions and other
items will save a little of it. Yet it is
still equivalent to carrying an additional
£200,000,000 in loans at 3y p.c. with
money at par. It will need an
amount equal to the whole of the
income tax collected by N. S. Wales,
Victoria and Queensland to take care
of Australian Government exchange this
year.

S. M. Bruce was 51 this month. If
his fate.-line remains consistent he won’t
get the' Prime Ministership yet awhile.
His years of progress nearly all end in
“3” —born ’B3, married ’l3, Prime Min-
ister ’23, High Commissioner ’33.
M.L. Socialists don’t know what to
make of G. B. Shaw. A Wellington
Labor M.P. met him on the wharf, and
poured out his troubles. “This country,”
he said, “is groaning under the dictator-
ship of Forbes and Coates.” Shaw
landed the complainant a terrific smack
on the back. “Splendid!” he cackled.
“I had no idea you were so advanced.
Two dictators!”
Soviet audiences will shortly thrill to
a drama of the Victorian Mallee. This
is Betty Davies’s “The Touch of Silk,”
which a Bulletin critic acclaimed as
probably the best Australian drama when
it was produced in Melbourne six years
ago. The Moscow theatre authorities are
producing it on their experimental stage.
Mrs. Davies gets 600 roubles down and
4} p.c. on the gross. She went to Russia
over a year ago, and has maintained her-
self by her pen ever since.
Arthur Fair, who succeeds MacGregor,
J., of M.L. Appeal Court, was 29 and
had been for eight years with Skerrett
and Wylie in Wellington when the Great
War broke out. Being in England on
holiday, he enlisted in Kitchener’s Army,
got a commission in the Suffolk Regi-
ment, served in Egypt and Palestine,
and emerged Captain Fair, M.C. On his
return he became successively Crown
Solicitor in Wellington, Solicitor-General
and K.C. He has done a lot of buckshee
work for returned soldiers, and helped
to write the history of his war-time
battalion.
“Old Tiv”: Connie Ediss, who has
gone where there are no more leg-shows,
rivalled Marie Lloyd as a music-hall
favorite 40 years ago. Like Marie, she
capitalised her avoirdupois, and was a
natural satirist. She left the ’Alls after
a few years, and worked for George
Edwardes at the Gaiety, where she mostly
played Mrs. Newly-Rich parts. I can
still hear her rich Cockney snigger in
“ ’Ow I lurv Sassiety!” She toured Aus-
tralia during the war, and expressed her-
self freely on the subject of local eligibles
who weren’t joining up. Someone showed
her a copy of the “Era” when she was
in Sydney which revealed that no fewer
than 400 English mummers were shirking
in America. It nearly paralysed her. She
was beginning to establish herself as a
movie actress when the end came at 62.
From one who knew him:
Andrew Kirkaldy, the world’s most cele-
brated golf pro., has died near St. Andrews,
where he started as a caddie 60-odd years ago.
He had a collection of clubs that resembled
hockey-sticks, and claimed at 65 to be able to
drive 150 yards with any of them. He was the
inventor of the comic-caddie yarn; in fact, he
created the humorous caddie, who has ever been
as hard to find in Scotland as witty ’busmen
have been in London. A natural gossip, his
stories lost half their point when divested of
the Doric in which he used to tell them and
put into a book a few years ago. He revered
Scottish peers and their relations, particularly
if they could play golf, and had little time for
Southrons, however eminent.
Prof. J. B. Cleland, who gets the rare
Verco medal of the Royal Society of
S.A., is Adelaide-born and London-
trained, but had wide experience as a
Government biologist in Perth and Syd-
ney before taking a “chair” of medicine
in Adelaide. He was president of the
Royal Society of N.S.W. in 1917.
W. R. Kelly, who was called to the
S.A. Bar in 1921, has crammed a lot
into the intervening years. He began
practice at once, and became mayor of
Yorketown. Later he was S.M. at Adel-
aide, Port Augusta and Wallaroo. Then
he was made chairman of the Police
Appeal Board. He became president of
W. R. KELLY, president of the S.A.
Industrial Court.
the S.A. Industrial Court in 1930. He
has handled several Royal Commissions,
and recently created a mild sensation by
accusing Premier Butler of misrepresent-
ing the position regarding teachers’
salaries. Attention to detail is his recipe
for success.
Justice Lowe has one of the most
logical and analytical minds on the Vic-
torian Bench, and it is coupled with a
singularly courteous, albeit frigid, man-
ner. He has needed all these qualities
lately, having had to deal with the will
of one of the most emotional, hard-
headed, illogical, brainy, generous, parsi-
monious, friendly and truculent artists
that Australia has produced—namely,
Melba. Every gent, one who saw the
Victoria’s youngest Judge.
will in which she left £BOOO in per-
petuity for a scholarship at the Albert-
street Conservatorium, “in the hope
that another Melba may arise,” knew
there would be litigation, and they
haven’t been disappointed. Did she con-
template a male as well as a female
Melba? Could there be a tenor, con-
tralto, lyrico-spirito or basso-profundo
Melba, or only a soprano Melba? Could
there be a Tasmanian or N. S. Wales
Melba, or only a Victorian one? Could
there be in any one year more than one
Melba? These are among the bewilder-
ing problems which his Honor has been
considering with Arctic calm during the
past week.
Melbourne Uni., which is following
Sydney in appointing an administrative
vice-chancellor —in effect, a general man-
ager—has offered the job to Dr. A. C.
D. Rivett. He comes from the top-
drawer of the Commonwealth Public
Service as chief of the C.S.I.R. A
Queen’s College man, he took his B.Sc.
with first-class honors at the University
in 1906. A Rhodes scholarship took him
through Oxford, and then he had a
year or two at the Nobel Institute in
Stockholm. He returned to Melbourne
as lecturer in chemistry, and rose to a pro-
fessorship. He is a Tasmanian, and in
his late forties.
“S.T.S.”: My old friend Ernest Whit-
ington, who has just died, was an amaz-
ing all-rounder. He was an acknow-
ledged expert on fowls, dogs, flowers and
field-shooting. He was at different times
dramatic critic, art critic, reporter for
country shows, leader of “Hansard” and
chief-of-staff on Adelaide “Register.”
For years he interviewed all worth-while
visitors, so that, when he started a
daily personal column as “Rufus” five
years ago, he had an infinite variety of
material. When the “Register” was
merged in the “Advertiser” he went over
with it, and now had all S.A. as audience
every morning. Latterly he added a
Friday broadcast, on the same intimate
lines, and thus made friends all over
Australia.
The late Andrew Spence Chirnside was
a sporting phenomenon. He one:; won a
steeplechase at Flemington after his
mount had fallen. He hunted his own
pack and was the first master of the
Ballarat District Hunt Club. He did a
lot of hunting in the English shires, and
won several point-to-points there on his
own horses. He once bet a Victorian
bookie £5OO to £5 that he would ride
the winners of six races in succession.
He won five. His brother won the sixth.
Another of his diversions was big-game
hunting. A result of one of his visits to
S’Africa was a pamphlet describing the
atrocities of the Blantyre mission which
caused an immense stir in Scotland and
moved the Church to furious action.
John Atkinson, who died last week,
was a son of Major-General Atkinson,
who had a distinguished career in India,
and a brother of Mrs. Pat Osborne, of
Currandooley. He was thus an uncle
of Harry Osborne, of Currandooley,
P. H. Osborne, the racing-owner, and
J. B. N. Osborne, of Bowylie. He had
lived in Australia for over 60 years, and
had been a member of the Australian
Club for half a century, having joined it
at a time when members of the Osborne
clan never thought of becoming associated
with any other Sydney club. Apart from
his many pastoral and business interests,
he worked all his life for patriotic move-
ments of one kind and another. He
started the Red Cross carpentry branch
during the World War, and was secre-
tary of the Bushmen’s Contingent in the
S. African War.
Few journalists have had such an
adventurous career as Syd Deamer. He
left England as a youth to make a for-
tune in the Golden West. Gold evaded
him to such purpose that he had to take
to sleeper-cutting at one stage of his
career. Then he came to Sydney and
started the “School Sportsman.” He
joined the A.F.C. when the war started,
and presently got a commission. His
O.C. and instructor was the late Colonel
Oswald Watt, who had joined the French
Flying Corps, as the British didn't come
into the war soon enough for him.
Deamer is dumb on the subject of his
war exploits ; a few of them are to be
found in Cutlack’s “Official History. ’
SYDNEY DEAMER, editor-in-chief of
Melbourne “Herald.”
He went from Sydney “Sun” to Mel-
bourne “Herald,” and when Adelaide
“Register” was absorbed by the North-
cliffes of Victoria he its first
editor. He was promoted to the “Herald”
when the “Register” and “Advertiser
amalgamated. A delicate-looking cus-
tomer with a winsome voice and a con-
ciliatory manner, anyone might think he
was easy to bluff who hadn’t tried to do
it. R. G. Menzies, who, as legal repre-
sentative of the A.J.A., faced Deamer
in conference over a classification matter,
paid him a graceful compliment: “If
all pressmen were like Mr. Deamer
there would be no need for classification
schemes: they would all be ‘A’ men.”

The improvement in conditions generally
in S. Aus., where most of the bank’s
business is done, was better than the
spring of £770 in last year’s net earnings
suggests. Still, there is not the profit these
days that there used to be in banking.
What there is is derived mainly from the
difference between advance and deposit
rates, the margin between buying and
selling prices in the exchange market,
returns from investments and pickings
from inter-State and other branch
clearances. Everywhere margins and in-
terest rates have narrowed and the
volume of business has been reduced,
while taxation has added to overhead
and the call for contingencies has become
louder —slump followed close on the
heels of drought in S. Aus. Hence the
sharp drop in earnings over the last four
years, and the lowering of the div., which
had been steady at 10 p.e. for the dozen
years to the close of accounts in 1929,
to 4 p.e.
After setting aside something for bad
and doubtful debts and other contin-
gencies, the year’s net result was no more
than 2.3 p.e. on shareholders’ funds
(capital ana reserves combined), or 4.3
p.e. on the £1,250,000 of capital alone, as
against 4.2, 5.3, 7.3, 11, 11.6, 11.1 and
11.6 p.e. back to 1927. The div. was kept
at 4 p.e.
In the market the £lO shares paid to
£5 (the other £5 is a contingent liability
payable only in the event of liquidation)
advanced from £5 12s. to £6 over the
last 12 months, due partly to the further
cheapening of money. The return at £6
is 3.3 p.e. on a 4 p.e. div. basis ; so the
investor who looks for a shade over 4
p.e. on his money counts on a 5 p.e. div.
The pressure of fixed deposits is easing,
and the recovery in trade generally, and
in wool in particular, should mean a bit
better demand for credit and a lighter
call for contingencies. Still, owing to
talk of nationalisation by people who
fancy they have a genius for planning
other people’s clothes, bank scrip remains
under a cloud at the moment.
To meet a shrinkage of £469,549 in
deposits and £53,646 in the bills figures,
the co. drew upon liquids for £482,820
and reduced the book value of advances
by £39,863 last year:

According to the sworn averages, 71.4
p.e. of the deposits was interest-bearing
for the last quarter of 1933, as against
75.1 p.e. three years earlier. When the
books closed, £52 12s. of every £lOO of
the public’s money was held liquid, and
for every pound of its own funds the
bank held only £2 17s. of the publics
money. It is a strong position, but it
means low earning power.

*After deducting intangibles.
This lame duck got lamer last year.
Certainly more new business was put
on the books —an extra £27,849 in
the Ordinary department (£100,232)
and an additional £125,964 in the
Industrial section (£463,128). Yet total
income was £466 lighter, due to
lapses and the absence of consideration
for annuities (£6OOO in 1932), while out-
goings (£92,258) were £22,976 heavier,
£16,063 of the increase being on account
of Industrial claims (£37,408), and most
of the balance was said to be in respect
of taxation, shown separately for the first
time at £5068. Thus the year’s excess of
incomings over outgoings was £23,442
lighter at £3058. This amount was added
to the Assurance fund, making it £309,095
at the end of December. The book value
of net tangibles was then £261,187.
Assuming that the assets are worth their
book value, and that the fund exactly
covers liabilities under policies —and that
is taking a very liberal view of the posi-
tion-then the whole of the paid-up capi-
tal (£96,050) and £47,908 belonging to
policy-holders besides was no longer
visible, notwithstanding that shareholders
had put up an extra £18,531 in 1930. At
the end of that year the actuary com-
pleted his second quinquennial overhaul
of the business; but his figures were not
sent out, a practice which ought to be
discouraged by legislation. The result
was incorporated in the accounts at the
end of 1931, when £74,837 was added to
the Assurance fund. Only £35,206 of
the increase, however, was accounted for
by the year’s excess of incomings over
outgoings; the other £39,631 was ap-
parently the amount by which the fund
fell short of requirements. This shortage
was added to the establishment account,
which was also reduced by £17,811 on
account of share forfeitures. A
further £7322 was struck off in the fol-
lowing year, reducing intangibles to
£143,959, at which figure they still stand.
The protection that remains for policy-
holders is in this form:

When the books closed shareholders could
be called upon for a further £22,875,
though it is doubtful whether more than
a fraction of this could be got in now.
Taking the lot into the reckoning, net
tangibles were still £25,033 short of the
Assurance fund.
Splitting administrative charges in pro-
portion to net premium income, and
assuming that consideration for annuities
cost £3 per cent., the balance of the year’s
exes, got away with 48.5 p.c. of the Ordi-
nary premiums, as against 50.5, 35.6, 63.3
and 58.6 p.c. back to 1929.
In the Industrial section outgoings
exceeded incomings by £7263, due to the
spring of £16,063 in claims (£37,408).
Exes, took 55 p.c. of the premiums, as
against 55.6 p.c. and 53.2 p.c. for the
two preceding terms.
After deducting taxes, last year’s net
interest return was 1.9 p.c. on the mean
fund, whereas the offce assumes that its
funds will earn 4 p.c.
The precarious position into which the
co. has drifted is due to (1) the high cost
of putting the business on the books, (2)
heavy lapses, (3) purchase of some ready-
made industrial contracts at too high a
figure, and (4) heavy losses in the Fire
and Marine section, sold in 1924 lor
£25,378 in scrip. At the moment it is
hard to catch a ray of brightness in the
co.’s outlook.

*After deducting bonuses to staff.
The recovery in the building trade and
the enterprise of the management are
responsible for the spring in the latest
figures. The co., formed by the Wunder-
lichs in the eighties of last century, has
a splendid record. Its factories, which are
scattered throughout Australia and M.L.,
turn out tiles, terra-cotta, shop fronts,
show cases, etc. The ords. averaged
12 p.c. for the decade to the close of
accounts in 1930, and £107,369 of staff-
partnership certificates was provided out
of earnings and £36,454 in divs. was paid
thereon over the same period. Then
slump gave the trade a nasty jolt, and
the div. has been kept at 5 p.c. for the
last four years, though reserves have had
to be tapped each time to pay it.
Early in the last term £BO,OOO of third
prefs. were offered and quickly taken.
They brought with them £3748 of share
premiums, which were added to reserves.
Paid capital became £599,984 in
40,000 first, a like number of second and
80,000 third prefs. and 440,000 ords. The
prefs., which are all 7 p.c. cumulative
(the firsts and seconds less 1 p.c. statu-
tory cut), rank in the order stated for
divs. and capital. The new capital was
used mainly to pay off the mortgage
(£32,355) on the co.’s Perth property, and
to put up a tile factory on a new clay
site at Vermont (Vic.) at a cost of
£22,835, including minor additions to
plant generally. The old tile factory
at Brunswick was dismantled, and its
book value (£19,750) written off out of
reserves: —

The total reduction in the outside debt
was £48,385, and the net addition to the
book value of fixed assets £6543, while
debtors’ balances were £3802 heavier and
stocks £2522 lighter, all healthy move-
ments. The year’s spring in the more or
less liquid surplus (£88,281) was £50,373.
Though prospects of further improve-
ment in earnings are encouraging, after
paying last year’s pref. divs., which were
nearly three times covered, the balance
of net earnings was only 3.2 p.c. on ord.
capital. The market expects the 5 p.c.
div. to be maintained. On this basis
the ords. return 4.1 p.c. at 245. The firsts
are priced at 245., seconds 235. 6d. and
thirds 255. 9d., at which figures the return
(after allowing for the statutory cut) is
4.5 p.c., 4.6 p.c. and 5.4 p.c. respectively.
The net tangible cover is £l6 13s. 3d.

The board of this co. (it runs a chain ol
drug stores in Sydney and manufactuies
much of its own requirements) is faced
with an embarrassment of riches lor
which it can find no employment in the
business. At the end of January, Gov-
ernment securities alone (£275,511) were
£23,511 in excess of paid capital, while
the amount coming to sundry creditors
was more than twice covered by book
debts and cash. The co. could thus
return the whole of its capital and more
besides without causing any inconveni-
ence so far as its ordinary trade activities
are concerned. Consider these figures.—

Last year debtors’ balances were reduced
by £24,063 and £24,306 was added to
shares in other cos., mostly Soul-Pattin-
son (Newcastle), Ltd., and Soul-Pattinson
(Laboratories), Ltd. At the same time
the cash holding was strengthened by
£29,401 and public securities by £4399,
while £8032 was added to outside liabili-
ties, etc. What the etcetera is the “Wild
Cat” doesn’t know, but, excluding shares
in other cos., the more or less liquid
surplus (£382,577) improved £1705.
Declared net earnings for the twelve-
month were 17.3 p.c. on capital, as
against 15.6, 14.2, 17.3, 22.9, 22 and
22.7 p.c. back to 1928. Considering that
over 52 p.c. of the total assets was repre-
sented by Government securities and cash
at the end of January, the results sug-
gest that the other assets are well worth
their book value. Trade picked up dur-
ing the last half, and a 3d. bonus is to
be sent out with the 10 p.c. div., raising
the rate to 12} p.c. p.a. For the dozen
years to the end of Jan., 1931, a steady
12} p.c. was paid, sweetened at intervals
with cash bonuses, which raised the aver-
age distribution to 15 p.c.
About four years ago shareholders
asked the directors to consider the ques-
tion of a bonus scrip issue, but slump
intervened. However, when it considers
the time ripe, the board may prefer
to reward shareholders in a way which
has less sting in its tail. The market
prices the pound shares at 675., as against
575. a year ago. At the higher figure the
return is 3.7 p.c. on a p.c. div. basis,
or 4.5 p.c. on a 15 p.c. distribution.

Apart from the possibilities of Govern-
ment interference, the future of these
trustee cos. looks as assured as anything
of the kind can look these days. With
the exception of the small chances the
cos. take when investing their own funds,
they do not have to risk much ; and pre-
sent-day complications connected with
the administration of estates is sending
more business into their expert care.
Still, corpus and other earnings have
been affected by the shrinkage in values,
interest and rents and the growth in
taxation, while moratorium legislation
and the dulness in the property market
have delayed the winding-up of estates.
This one, which has strong connec-
tions in pastoral circles, began in Mel-
bourne 49 years ago, and has since set
up outposts at Sydney, Brisbane and
Townsville. It doesn’t broadcast the
volume of trusts on hand, but gross earn-
ings, etc., have moved in this way:

While last year’s income shrank £447,
exes, were pulled back £1553. After set-
ting aside £2OOO for taxation, and
including £BOl dropped from some-
where into the investment fluctuation re-
serve, the net result was 7.6 p.c. on capi-
tal as against 6.5, 8.1 and 11.2 p.c. for
the three preceding terms. The div. was
kept at 6 p.c., which is worth over 8 p.c.
to old holders at par, owing to capitali-
sations since 1920 (£37,500).
At the end of February assets con-
sisted of freehold, £131,838 ; Government
securities, £61,210; mortgage, £l5OB ;
book debts, cash, etc., £14,997. The only
outstanding liability was £77 of un-
claimed divs.
The shares are 50s. paid to 275. 6d.;
all but 2s. 6d. of the remaining 225. 6d.
is a reserve liability callable only in the
event of liquidation. They are offered
at 535. in the market as against 445. a
year ago. At 535. the return is 3.1 p.c. on
a 6 p.c. div. basis, or 4.1 p.c. on an
8 p.c. distribution. The backing is 40s.
7d. in net tangibles.
Two London concerns Oroville
Dredging, which has extensive interests
in North and South America, and which
holds 76,000 Bulolo Gold Dredging
shares, and the Camp Bird Co., which
was opening up the silver-lead-copper
deposits at Captain’s Flat (N.S.W.) when
the market broke —have become inter-'
ested in four groups of deep leads at
Avoca (Vic.); this on the recommenda-
tion of Mr. Watson, Oroville’s manager
at Pato, Colombia (S. America). A sub-
sidiary, Talbot Alluvials, whose capital
has been increased from £lOO,OOO to
£150,000, is to work the Talbot pro-
perty, from which an annual working
profit of £128,000 is expected with gold
at £6 an ounce sterling. The life of the
show is put at 17 years, and the mine
should begin production about Septem-
ber next. Incidentally, the flow of water
does not exceed 12,000 gallons an hour.
Also, the Talbot Co. has thrown off two
pups of its own —the Madam Hopkins,
to take over about nine miles of the
Bet-Bet lead, and the Homebush Co.,
which is to work another 10 miles of
the same lead system. The average width
of the wash on the Hopkins property
is approximately 1500 ft.

Central Blue, Bendigo, finished up the
six months to the end of January £2282
on the wrong side. Only 359 tons of
stone was crushed. No payable ore-
bodies have yet been discovered.
* * * *
Tentative ideas about reworking the
abandoned ore-bodies in the Scottish
Gympie (Q.) have cropped up several
times in the last couple of years. The
hurdle has been the ocean underground ;
the mines drain the major portion of the
adjoining mine workings, which are now
flooded and are most extensive. To side-
step this difficulty it is proposed to test
the third bed of slate, which lies deeper
than the already-worked reefs. The third
slate has been rich in several areas on
other parts of the field, but has not been
worked about the Inglewood or Monk-
land. It was stated to have been cut
at 1784 ft. in the Amalgamated Glanmire
and Monkland shaft, and the present
scheme rests largely on the favorable
report of the country by the late Govern-
ment Geologist B. Dunstan.
* * * *
Stevenson and his mates have had rare
luck on the Last Resource claim on the
Cumberland gold-lead, Clermont (C.Q.).
His was the one party that struck it rich
on the whole lead. During the last
12 months they netted over £5OOO.
The streak was almost on their neigh-
bor’s boundary, and the crowd next
door had their shaft down looking for
the elusive thing. But Stevenson’s luck
held, and the Last Resource got a new
lease of life when the streak doubled
back in the opposite direction, leaving
outsiders cursing their luck. It’s been the
only worth-while strike in the locality
during the last two years.
* * * *
Crocodile Creek Dredging Co., recently
floated in Melbourne to work 120 acres
of alluvial near Rockhampton (Q.), has
taken an option over a further 200 acres
adjoining its present holding on the
south. The dredge, which is to set in on
the 120 acres about the end of this
month, is scheduled to turn over
480,000 c.y. of Is. 5.5 d. dirt annually
for an anticipated working profit of
£28,000 with gold at £7 per ounce in
Australian currency.

“Black Mountain”: Kingston Gold
Mines, which was working an opencut
14 miles from Brisbane, has a new mine
manager, who may be able soon to state
definitely whether it is any use the co.
going on. The low-grade stuff became
less and less payable, until the show was
operated by some of the men on tribute.
* * * *
Misima Gold Reefs (New Guinea) has
granted an option over its half-dozen
leases, aggregating approximately 112
acres, on Misima Island, Papua, to a
London crowd. The gold-bearing lodes
are believed to be an extension of the
very profitable ore-body now being
worked by the New Misima Co., whose
property the optioned claims adjoin.
Major Stuart G. Love is on his way to
the island to test the show, and if results
come up to expectations a co. will be
formed in London to work it.
* * * sjc
Hampton Gold Mining Areas has given
Gt. Boulder Prop, an option over the
White Hope, Hampton Plains (W.A.),
which is to be test-bored at depth. The
purchase price is £4OOO cash and 20,000
fully-paid £1 shares in any co. formed
to work the property. Whether White
Hope will prove to be a slippery place
to build castles, even with gold at its
present price, remains to be seen. Hamp-
ton Gold Mining Areas is a London
concern, formed in 1920, which holds
nearly 200,000 acres of freehold and
mineral rights in Westralia. It has not
yet made any return to shareholders on
the £200,000 originally subscribed.
*l*
New Venture, which has many irons in
the fire, has taken options over the Lord
Bobs and Grosmont, near Coolgardie
(W.A.). Both properties have wide ore-
bodies, and the Lord Bobs has given
prospectors good returns over a number
of years. Unwatering of the Redemption,
Coolgardie, is proceeding, but Bailey’s
Boronia, near by, has been abandoned
on account of low values. On the Queen
Extended the stone has thus far failed
to improve in the south drive at the 105 ft.
level ; driving is to be continued. The
Brilliant is showing only low-grade stuff,
and the Asteroid, at Grosmont, has failed
to live up to the values exposed in the
bottom of the shaft, though lOdwt. ore
was found in the west drive. Encourag-
ing developments have occurred near the
Kapai leases, Kalgoorlie.
* * * *
At Welch’s Find, near Yarri (W.A.),
the gold occurs in a quartz-felspar-por-
phyry formation —it is unusual for the
yellow stuff to be found in this form of
granite rock —which is heavily mineral-
ised and has been submitted to intense
shearing, says Government Geologist
Blatchford. He recommends prospecting
by shafts and bores —at present the
deepest shaft is about 30ft. The Por-
phyry Gold Co., which has an option
over the property, has installed a small
steam plant to work rock drills ; diamond
drilling may be undertaken later. Some
70,000 tons of stone, said to be worth
£140,000, can be quarried.
* * * *
Lake View and Star estimates the
quantity of residues in the dumps of its
latest acquisition, the Associated, at be-
tween H and 2 million tons. No guess
is made at the profit likely to be derived
from retreatment of the stuff; but the
“Wild Cat” would not be surprised if
the figure exceeds £150,000. Incidentally,
Lake Views were listed on the Paris
Bourse on March 12.
* * * *
North Kalgurli has made another esti-
mate of its ore reserves, which, apart
from a quantity of stone not sufficiently
developed to take into account, it puts
at 471,475 tons averaging 9.2dwt. These
figures show a slight fall in grade and
a substantial increase in tonnage com-
pared with those of a year ago.

Backed by Gt. Boulder and others,
Southern Cross Gold Development,
formed to acquire Fraser’s group (W.A.),
recently floated like a cork in London.

nor William Campion and C. de Bernales.
* * * *
Granites Development, which took up
an extra 500 acres at North Wiluna
(W.A.) on Dr. Loftus Hills’s recommen-
dation, has had the area geophysically
surveyed. Indications are that the ore-
body, probably low-grade, exists to a
depth of 500 ft. The board has decided
to test this area by diamond drilling.
* * * *
At Reedys, near Cue (W.A.), the Triton
Co. has deepened the shaft on the Emu
North section from 175 ft. to 242 ft., and
the one on the Emu section from 163 ft.
to 197 ft. Both are to go down to 300 ft.,
where the sulphides are to be opened
up. The position of the new main
shaft will be determined according to
developments.

Mt. Magnet Gold Mines, an English
co. which took possession of the old
Hill 60 mine at Mt. Magnet (W.A.) last
year, is putting its shoulder to the wheel,
and there is talk of installing a treat-
ment plant before long. The shares are
in few hands.

“O.B.”: With the certainty of being
asked for more in the shape of calls,
Adelaide has lately put money into some
Westralian ventures that haven’t a chance
of being profitable. Some have been
floated on the recommendation of “ex-
perts” after condemnatory reports have
been made by engineers of repute.
* * * *
Despite the calc-schist bogey at Kal-
goorlie (W.A.), the North Kalgurli Co.,
which is operating more or less in this
class of formation,, reports reserves of
471,475 tons of 375. ore. This is being
mined and treated at the rate of 3600
tons a month, but extraction is shortly
to be increased.

QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(1) Where is rock silica found in N. S. Wales ?
(2) In what industries is it used ? (3) Present
market value in Sydney? —lo32.
(1) Rock silica occurs as white quartz in the
Gundagai, Bathurst and Orange districts, and
as quartzite at Ulladulla, Marrangaroo and
Cooma.. (2) The quartz is ground and used
mainly in the ceramic industry and in abrasive
soaps. Quartzite is used in the manufacture
of refractory bricks. (3) White quartz ranges
from 255. to 30s. per ton in Sydney, but the
demand. is limited. There is practically no
market in Sydney for quartzite.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
T.K.C.: They are long-term speculations; if
you cannot afford to lose keep out AF N •
(1) Last review B. 10/1/’34. (2) The co. is
struggling to turn the corner. (3) They are
all reputable men. (4) and (5) Not nearly so
good as offered by the well-established con-
cerns. (6) Yes, but it was not earned
Dubious: (1) and (2) If safety of capital is
important you had better look elsewhere....
G.W.K.: They may go higher yet, but the
debt, the amount invested in property and com-
petition make the future of the scrip very un-
certain. The return at 14s. 9d. would be 4
p.c. on a 3 p.c. div. (£8750). For the Dec.
half of last year the co. netted £6025 FS •
Not recommended.


SHADOW SHOWS.
“Rome Express”
The best British films seem to be
treated in Australia like vintage wines ;
they aren’t brought out till they have
acquired cobwebs. “Hindle Wakes” —in-
comparably better than any Hollywood
picture of its type —didn’t arrive till the
characters’ clothes were out of date, and
Sydney is still waiting for “Henry VIII.”
Last week “Rome Express” was borne
from the cellar and screened at Sydney
Mayfair.
It is phenomenally clever. Practically
the whole of the action occurs on the
express, and the effect of the settings and
photography is such that the onlooker
can almost smell, as well as see and hear,
the Gare de Lyon, the train, the tun-
nels, Modane and the Termini at Rome.
The acting, as in “Hindle Wakes,” is
so good that it is hard to choose any
one performer as the best. The writer
preferred Gordon Harker as a pest who
is known wherever a golf club exists.
On the other hand, Cedric Hardwicke
is pretty well flawless as a millioriaire
with a sadistic habit of insulting his
cringing secretary. These characters also
are universal. Conrad Veidt is more
sinister than the most bloodthirsty
Chicago gangster who has been shown on
a screen to date, and Donald Calthrop,
who has double-crossed him, makes a
superb foil. Altogether it is a great
thriller, and, more than that, a great
gallery of modern types.
“That’s My Wife”
It is almost incredible that such an
entirely competent job as “Rome
Express” and such a masterpiece of
inanity as “That’s My Wife” should have
come from the same part of the world.
Harry Tate is in it, amongst other cele-
brities. His moustache-wobbling, which
looks appropriately loony when he is
playing a comic in vaudeville, gets tire-
some to a degree in this production. He
is supposed to be a movie-director.
Betty Astell, a London shopgirl, gets in
with a temperamental film star while
delivering garments at the studio, and
her experiences form the plot. All are
bad, but she is easily the worst. She
achieves the remarkable feat of playing
a big part without registering a single
natural gesture or expression.
“India Speaks”
If Baron Munchausen had lived to-
day he would have done his lying with
a camera. The gentleman who describes
his adventures at the Plaza is no more
convincing than the baron, but he is
more sensational. There is a tense
moment when, disguised as a Moham-
medan, he participates in the secret devo-
tions of 30,000 followers of Allah: is
identified, and only escapes with his life
by leaping into a passing ox-cart which
bears him away at a gallop from the
enraged multitude. In Tibet he intrudes
on a kind of Lama mass, and at the
solemn moment when a Hollywood
chorine starts undulating before the high
altar he is obliged to bolt again. His
camera and cameraman were presumably
invisible. The picture is interesting when
it sticks to facts, and it has some fine
scenic shots.
“Flying Down to Rio”
More good work for Sovietism. No
one even pretends to work in this one
except luxury-hotel employees. Gene
Raymond is a jazz-band conductor who
flies his own ’plane, is a devil with the
ladies, talks with a Bowery voice, dresses
divinely and retains his marcel wave in
all circumstances. Dolores del Rio is
the maiden whose rolling eyes, gleaming
teeth and waggling hips enthral him.
Love-making apart, the chief hobbies of
the principals are dancing and cham-
pagne. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers
figure in conjunction with a ballet which
specialises in old Brazilian folk-steps.
“Ginger Rogers,” says the “S. M.
Herald,” “has never been more saucy.”
.Saucy is certainly one of the right words.
The writer has seen nothing quite like
the sequence in which her sauciness is
given full expression since the British
cleaned up Port Said. Ginger Rogers
for all, Aldous Huxley for none ; it is a
complete lesson in the imbecility of
government by civil servants.
“Son of Kong”
Sydney Capitol’s latest doesn’t live up
to its posters, which promise an ape as
big as Kong, luscious scenes between
Robert Armstrong and Helen Mack and
a finale in which Kong, Jun., sinks with
a despairing howl after delivering Miss
Mack from a convulsion of nature. The
heroine has stowed away aboard a tramp
steamer. She is extracted from the hold
with a small smudge on one cheek, indi-
cating bitter privations. Armstrong im-
mediately falls for her, but, being a
strong, silent bloke, he doesn’t disclose
what is biting him on the spot.
Kong’s offspring wanders through the
sets, sometimes 12ft., sometimes 20ft.,
sometimes 40ft. high. An unhappy
animal, he seems worried by his altera-
tions in size, which are not, as in the
case of Carroll’s Alice, achieved of his
own volition. He saves Armstrong from
a watery grave by hoisting him out of
the water with a hand that comfortably
spans the man’s body—he is 40ft. high
at the time. In other scenes he wrestles
with antediluvian monsters, and makes
sympathetic noises whenever Mr. Arm-
strong and Miss Mack are imperilled by
the prehistoric fauna. He should be a
MAE GIRAFFE: “Come up and see me sometime!”
wow at matinees: every animal-loving
kid will want a pet like him.
“Shadows of Sing Sing”
The venue is the identification depart-
ment in an American gaol. The details
carry conviction —taking of finger-prints,
photographing of prisoners, the old super-
intendent who seldom forgets a face,
and the elaborate detailing, analysis and
classification of all features and anato-
mical details which help the police to
track a criminal though only meagre
clues may be in their possession. There
is some fine acting by Grant Mitchell
(superintendent), Bruce Cabot (his son)
and half a dozen people who represent
gangsters, not as heroes, but as adults
with child minds.
“David Harum”
There is little room for improvement
in Will Rogers’s David Harum in
the film of that name at the Regent,
though it would be all to the good if he
didn’t mumble so much. The character,
as every Edwardian knows, is a small-
town banker who is above suspicion dur-
ing banking hours, but not so honest
when it comes to horse-coping. But
everybody did it then, just as everybody
car-copes in our day. The deacon him-
self isn’t above selling Rogers a blind
horse as sound. Rogers retaliates by sell-
ing him a trotter that won’t start. Later
Rogers buys back the trotter to help
one of his clerks win the hand of the
usual desirable maiden. The maiden
eventually secures the prad, and enters it
in a race, and Rogers steers it to victory.
The climax is a scream.
Rogers has excellent support. Louise
Dresser plays his sister. Evelyn Venable
and Kent Taylor make a nice pair of
lovers. Charles Middleton almost steals
the show as the deacon, and the negro
Stepin Fetchit adds a most curious whine
to his usual box of tricks.
“Cross-country Cruise”
This reconstruction of a trip on a U.S.A.
transcontinental ’bus is very crude —a
thing of cheap sentiment, flat humor and
unnecessary bloodshed. The murder
leads to an unconvincing cross-examina-
tion of the ’bus passengers. Lew Ayres
is painful as a gallant young tourist of
means, and June Knight, as the heroine
(a sweet girl-wowser with Mae West man-
nerisms) is worse. Eugene Pallette and
Minna Gombell are amusing.
“Broadway Thru a Keyhole”
A Melb. Capitol sidelight on contem-
porary life and manners in the U.S.A.
Constance Cummings comes to town and
catches the eye of Russ Columbo, rac-
keteer. Russ learns to love the unsophis-
ticated country lass and gets her a job
in a night-club ballet. A bit of pri-
vate machine-gunning decides him to
send her to Miami out of harm’s way,
and she there succumbs to the charms of
a crooner, who confesses that he has a
failing—cowardice. Mr. Columbo hears
of the affair and orders the lady home.
Swallowing his fear the crooner pene-
trates to her dressing-room, where he is
found by the racketeer. Passion tri-
umphs gloriously over pusillanimity.
Looking down his rival’s gun the crooner
announces that he is ready to live or die
for love and places the responsibility for
the choice in the hands of Mr. Columbo.
The latter’s heart is touched. “Okay,”
he grunts, and retires to nurse his rav-
aged soul. After the wedding the girl
is kidnapped, and the Big Shot, going
forth to rescue her, is shot in error by
the police.
We catch our last glimpse of the hero-
thug in hospital, awaiting the electric
chair. As he gazes out of the window,
the lights of Broadway flicker in his mel-
ancholy eyes. He recalls wistfully his
bygone days of power and splendor, the
number of citizens he has bumped off,
his beautiful act of renunciation in re-
spect of the crooner. The expression of
one who sees Heaven’s gates opening,
and hears the music of angel-choirs, suf-
fuses his countenance. The end.
If this is American civilisation and
Roosevelt can cure it with his N.R.A.,
then G.P.I. sufferers can be cured with
fruit-salts.
“A Ticket in Tatt.’s”
If you’re amused by George Wallace
you’ll like it; if you aren’t, then stay
away. George wears an outsize in trou-
sers, serves in a grocer’s shop, breaks
eggs, throws flour over a customer, pulls
the shelves on top of himself, and puts
mustard in a neighbor’s tea. Among
other discrepancies the shop is twice as
big inside as out, and the butter used is
dough.
The. story, which dates from the dawn
of racing as our far-flung Empire knows
it, concerns Thelma Scott, whose father
owns Hotspur, an animal with a Cup
chance. She agrees to marry the owner
of the favorite if it wins, but falls in love
with a young author. Hotspur’s jockey is
missing on the day and another rider is
given the mount and told to lose. George,
who has trained the horse to come when
he whistles, saves the situation.
Some of the photography is good, par-
ticularly in the Flemington shots. The
rest of it is Early Elstree: whenever the
characters speak the camera is anchored
immovably in front of them.
“The Crosby Case”
This is a distinct contrast. It is only
a third-rate film, but the construction and
acting are excellent. There is nothing that
is unnecessary. Wynne Gibson, Alan Dine-
hart and “Skeets” Gallagher do it well.
Sundry Shows
Sydney harbors many composers, but
very few who can successfully attempt
the full orchestral score. Over 2FC on
an evening of last week floated the
secular music of Dom Stephen Moreno,
the organist at Sydney’s St. Pat.’s, inter-
preted by the A.B.C. Concert Orchestra
under the baton of the composer. The
“Valse Pathetique” might have been
scored by Strauss Secundus ; the “Funeral
March” seemed like a Chopin-Verdi
collaboration ; the “Minuet” had a strong
Beethoven flavor; the “Tarantelle” was
much like other Tarantelles in lilt, but
forgot to let the tarantula sting it; and
the “Festival Overture” (an improvisa-
tion on “Foreza Jolli”) and “Triumphal
March” were full of sweet echoes of
familiar things. All were beautifully
orchestrated and nicely played. Any of
these works could be sandwiched into a
classical programme without seeming out
of place. Most modern composers take
jolly good care that they shan’t be mis-
taken for the ancients, and often their
striving for originality involves them
in strange chords and progressions
that set the teeth on edge. Moreno
is the apostle of smooth melody.
He played pianoforte accompaniments
to two of his “Boree Log suite
songs, sung sweetly by Mary Wilson,
and these were, artistically, the best
items of the recital. The pianoforte
and voice are far better means of directly
expressing a composer’s intention (even
if he’s an organist, which seriously ham-
pers his pianoforte technique) than any
orchestra.
* * *
Alfred Hill’s operetta “Giovanni,”
broadcast from Melbourne one evening
last week, follows the post-Wagnerian
mode. Music, which is mostly an-
guished, flows on and on. There are a
Count Alberto betrothed to a Countess
Violetta, a boy sculptor, the boy sculp-
tor’s mamma, a simple village maiden,
a priest and a porter. What they are upset
about wasn’t made clear. Mr. Hill s
brief explanation happened while 3LO
and 2FC weren’t playing speaks, and
the enunciation of the vocalists was the
reverse of pellucid. All that can be said
is that the characters got tremendously
worked up about something. The work
is neatly constructed and pleasingly or-
chestrated, and the Italian setting is re-
flected in the music, which in style
suggests the octogenarian Verdi sub-
edited by Puccini. But it is not even
unconsciously imitative. Hill has a strong
sense of drama and his powers of melo-
dic invention don’t require borrowed
crutches —or stilts. A. C. Bartleman, Tom
Downie, Pauline Bindley, Isolda Hill
(the composer’s daughter) and Freda
Treweek all sang well.
* * *
Carl Sauer’s juvenile orchestra of 60,
which made its first bow to the public
at Sydney Con. Hall on Saturday night,
plays very much as a puppy or a kitten
gambols—not always gracefully, but
always with spontaneity and elan. Schu-
bert’s best-known military march, the
most rhythmical of the “Rosamunde”
ballets and Grieg’s best-loved Norwegian
dance figured on the programme, together
with a minuet by the conductor. Some-
times Mr. Sauer conducted ; sometimes
a very small boy, and in the middle of
one item the conductor walked away
and left the band to keep its own time,
which it did very nicely.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Top-rail”: Haven’t seen a sozzled
cat (B. 11/4/’34), but animals with a
liking for the amber fluid that cheers are
not uncommon. I remember a bullock
owned by a publican near Brisbane
which would enter the bar and wait for
the mob to shout for it. During some
festivities it got tight and lay on the
ground rolling its eyes and bellowing
joyously to the universe. The R.S.P.C.A.
took a prohibition order out against the
beast. Soon afterwards it died, much to
Bung’s chagrin. Another dumb alcoholic
of my acquaintance was a goat. He was
famed in Townsville (N.Q.) in his day,
but became so disreputable eventually
that no one liked being seen in the same
bar. It was always advisable to shout for
him, however. I discovered this after
he had made a rear attack on my person.
His end was sad ; whilst jay-staggering
to a quiet lane for a sleep he was killed
by a passing car.

“Ela”: Giembo Deperessi must have hit
Port Moresby a lot harder than I suspected
if only four canoes now go to the building
“Was the body warm when you found it?”
“Too plurry right. Bin out in sun all day.”
of a lakatoi (B. 18/4/’34). In the hey-
day of the trade 40 would have been
nearer the truth. Though I agree that
rosy-cheeked girls are rare in Papua—
the only suggestion of rosiness amongst
the natives is shown by the yellow-
skinned lasses from the Milne Bay vil-
lages—l’m sceptical about that black-
cock found at heights over 10,000 ft. I
have been higher than that and never
located one or heard of the fowl. Even
Mtonckton, who always lived on the
verge of discovering extraordinary things
in Papua —he had visions of orang-
outangs, tapirs and the rare Asian rhino,
at various times —never conjured up a
guid Scots blackcock in his wildest
dreams.
* * * *
“Sands of Dee”: The cat that used
to go out after the dairy-farm milkers
and bring ’em into the yard (B. 18/4/’34)
was a mug. Fancy a cat walking miles
and getting its feet wet in the early-
morning dew or on rainy days —and cats
hate wet feet worse than being nagged
at! Our old tom was far brainier.
He’d sit on top of the gate-post
and lift up his voice—and, let me
say, it was a good one. The cows soon
took a tumble and answered the Assem-
bly regularly. The trouble was that they
used to come in at the double (I have
said that his voice was seductive), with
the result that the milk used often to
be separated when we drew it from
nature’s fount —cream one side and
skim the other. During years we never
bought a separator.
“Barangkali”: Bullet, my bull-terrier,
is friendly with Red, the Irish terrier
from the house opposite, and between
them they are the terror of the cat com-
munity. One day last week Red sneered
at a passing Alsatian, and lost a
lot of hair and a few pieces of
flesh for his cheek. All through the
fight Bullet was peacefully asleep at the
back of my house, dreaming no doubt
of cats, rats and the like. He was
awakened by Red coming flying over the
gate. After licking his cobber’s wounds
for a few seconds, the facts of the
case appeared to dawn on Bullet. With-
out more ado the two dogs cleared the
gate together. Red pointed up the street,
and off they went at full speed. Three
hundred yards along they caught up with
the Alsatian, and a royal battle com-
menced, the big dog putting up a good
tjght for a few minutes against heavy
odds. But numbers told, and the Alsatian
got the father of a hiding. Five minutes
fater Bullet was again in the land of
Freud.
* * * *
“Cooie-Bird”: Was fishing on the
Bananaland coast the other day when I
“Give me The Bulletin any time, Dave:
there ain’t no gags underneath these."
noticed what appeared to be a short
black spike forging steadily across stream
in my direction from the opposite bank.
When the spike drew near I was amazed
to discover that it was the snout of a
large echidna. Quills didn’t seem to be
any the worse off for his lengthy swim,
although the water was fairly rough from
the action of the brisk breeze that was
blowing. Subsequently I took an old-
man ant-eater aboard a boat, dumping
him overboard in midstream. . The old
boy was out of sight so long that I
thought I’d drowned him ; but presently
he appeared some distance downstream,
blew a thin stream of water high in the
air, and struck out for the shore, which
was soon reached. Have often bumped
against porcupines in the neighborhood
of tidal creeks. Mangrove-covered salt-
pans seem to have a particular attraction
for the spine-coated one.
* * * *
“A.H.S.”: At the annual concert of
the Woopville cricket club the vigor of
the visiting pianist
aroused the audi-
ence to enthusiasm.
Encouraged, he at-
tempted a solo that
for volume and
effects outdid any
previous effort, and
strained the ancient
Woopville piano to
the limit. It was in
the midst of the last
crashing chord that
Dad, who was sec-
retary of the show,
jumped up and
grabbed the pianist
by the shoulders.
“Cut it out! ” he
roared. “But they
like it,” protested
the surprised ivory-
tickler ; “yer didn’t
have any complaints
last year.” “Yairs,
that’s orright,” mut-
tered Dad into his
beard. “We ’ad a
borrered pianner last
year. This one be-
longs ter th’ club,
and it's got ter be
took care of. We’re goin’ ter raffle it
at the end o’ th’ season.”

“Yarragundy”: “Mho’s” two trout on
one hook (B. 11/4/’34) is bettered by
my catch of a 381 b. cod without a hook.
Fishing in the Old Man Creek, 40 miles
below Wagga (N.S.W.), I caught a 21b.
bream. Being hurried, I ran a tether
through mouth and gills. In the morn-
ing I found the bream inside a cod.
Fearful of pulling the bream out, I
coaxed the cod to the edge and gilled
him. I needn’t have been so careful,
About two inches of the bream’s tail
was sticking out of the cod’s gullet, and
nothing could shift the bait. The fins of
my bream had penetrated the lining of
the big fellow’s stomach and were more
immovable than a hook. With the excep-
tion of the hawk-moth, of which neither
bird nor fish will take the head, cod
invariably swallow live bait head first.
**' * *
“Coral Island”: At Heron Island, near
the southern extremity of the Great
Barrier Reef, 50 adult female green
turtles were marked by attaching a
numbered label through a hole bored
in one or the other of the pygal
plates. These animals returned again
and again over a period of years
at approximately fortnightly intervals.
The maximum number of layings
was seven, the average number of
eggs per laying being 120. The incuba-
tion period proved to be from 9y to 104
weeks, and not three or four according
to the fancy of previous writers. The
percentage hatch per nest varied from
a blank to 86. It was also found that
young turtles, carnivorous in their early
youth, can be kept successfully in salt-
water aquaria.
* * * *
“Rastus”: Between Newcastle Waters
and Tanami (N.T.) there are bores every
20 miles. Anderson and Hitchcock per-
ished about 180 miles south of the
Waters, and on the third bore after leav-
ing the township there is an inscription
in rhyme warning travellers not to waste
the water, and containing a reference to
the fate of the airmen. The remains
of their ’plane lie in the desert 50 miles
further south.
* * * *
“Tiewire”: The South Coast isn't the
only part of N. S. Wales where the platy-
pus abounds (B. 28/3/’34). I’ve fre-
quently seen the curious creatures
dragged up in fish-traps from the Cudge-
gong River, a tributary of the Macquarie.
Though the roomy traps were completely
submerged, every platypus was dead when
found. They were too shy to be seen
alive, and the only ones I ever set eyes on
there were the hundreds caught in the
traps.
* * * *
“A.M.R.” (New Hebrides): Futuna,
the most southerly but one of the New
Hebrides group, is the only one which
is free from the Anopheles mos-
quito. In consequence it is non-malarial.
There is practically no flat land on the
island, and, with the exception of a
fringe of cocoanut palms round the coast,
most of the cultivation is on the extreme
summit of a conical mountain, 3000 ft.
up, to which the women struggle every
day and labor in the taro gardens. The
summit, about a third of a mile square,
catches the rainfall, and is the only land
that it is possible to cultivate to any
extent. The natives are of Polynesian
stock ; with a few exceptions, the rest of
the New Hebrides natives are pure
Melanesians. The island is about four
miles in circumference, with a popula-
tion of a hundred and fifty-odd, who
speak a language somewhat akin to
Fijian. These people make the best
canoes in the group. The topsides are
lashed with sinnet; they can stand
heavy weather, and enable the islanders
to fish far away from the coast at times.
VANISHED TYPES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now shearers travel in motor-cars
From shed to shed or from town to town,
How does it go with the wayside bars,
The old-time settings for lambing down?
Are they one with the ancient Nineveh,
Whose very name but a memory grim is?
And their bosses? Where are the Stiffners, eh?
And what’s become of the Poisonous
Jimmies?
Those trapdoor spiders in human guise
(If Lawson assayed and read them right),
Have they passed away beyond mortal eyes?
Have they vanished into the Ewigkeitl
Those Bungs whose wiles were a byword black
For all that slimy and snide and slim is,
Have the Stiffners fled from the changed Out-
back?
And where, oh! where are the Poisonous
Jimmies?
’Twas a fruitful theme, I can certify,
The old bush shanty away out west,
With the jingling bottles, the cheque drunk dry,
The dismal deadhouse —and all the rest.
The flask to help you on drouthy ways
When they kicked you out —but the picture
dim is.
And where are the Stiffners nowadays? _
And what’s become of the Poisonous
Jimmies?
Now to bad old modes we have bid adieu
And ever the way of the world more trim is,
And all too few are the cheques to blew.
But what in the world do the Stiffners do?
And where, oh! where are the Poisonous
Jimmies?
N.S.W.
PIPARDS.
THE GUINEA
It goes this week to L. E. Calor, 18
Norman-street, Five Dock ( N.S.W. ), for
the following par. :
Was passing by a large kurra-
jong tree a dozen yards from a
bush track when I heard what
seemed to be a gale, yet not a leaf
was stirring. I traced the noise to
the foot of the kurrajong. The
whole of the ground within 20ft.
was covered with red ants. Their
rushing hither and thither across
the fallen and dried leaves created
a noise like a small whirlwind, and
close observation showed hundreds
of thousands of them with their
legs torn off, twisting and squirm-
ing on the ground, snapping their
mandibles when anything with legs
passed them. Others had as many
as six ants straining at their legs
in an endeavor to tear them limb
from limb. A unity confer-
ence was friendly by comparison.


“Mater”: Returning from a holiday
we pulled into a Milton (N.S.W.) garage
for oil. “How much do you charge?”
we asked. “A pint, Is. 2d. ; a quart, 2s.
5d.,” the owner assured us. We did
some mental arithmetic and suggested
that he had made a mistake ; whereupon
he showed annoyance. So we bought two
pints of oil, paid over two separate
amounts of Is. 2d. each, and departed.
* * * *
“C.P.C.”: “Hadene’s” mention of
Cheon, the once-bustling, jolly station
cook of Mrs. Tineas Gunn’s “We of the
Never Never” (B. 4/4/’34), is over ten
years out. As a shaky, sick old man,
Cheon left Darwin for China about 12
years ago and never returned to Aus-
tralia. The night before he sailed he
asked me to write out a telegram that
he wished to send to Mrs. Gunn
in Melbourne. It ran: “Good-bye,
missus, me go China die me old man
now close-up die.” Mrs. Gunn has kept
in touch with all her characters by cor-
respondence since the Elsey station days,
but she told me last year that she had
"Ere! Wot’s this? Wot’s this? ’Are you two been fightin’?”
not heard from Cheon for many years,
A countryman told me that he had gone
west about eight years ago.

Eureka”: Dad had an old cow that
he turned into the creek paddock, and
for days it fed on nothing but brook-
lime. The weed grows in most creeks
on the South Coast of N. S. Wales,
an< H •° 1 i t a b° s - use< 3 to make
a drink with more kick in it than a
camel team. The parson who stayed for
tea had a second helping of the milk
from the old cow and got disgracefully
blithered. Half a cup of it cured Dad’s
cold, though he still perseveres with the
treatment; and after Dave had a glass
of it he loaned the new hand his best
suit so that he could take Milly (Dave’s
girl) to the dance. Since that memorable
occasion Dad always turns the old cow
into the creek paddock every Saturday
morning. It saves him a long trip into
the pub, and anyhow the grog they sell
these days isn’t what it used to be.

“D.H.R.”: Riding the back paddocks
at Moonan Flat (N.S.W.) last week, I
saw an eagle rise from the ground clutch-
ing a large stick in its talons. It swooped
low over a patch of brush, where it
dropped the stick. Riding closer, I saw
that its aim was to frighten from shelter
a small wallaby that was dragging
a rabbit-trap on one foot. In
this battle of wits, however, the
wallaby won. Again and again
it struck the trap on a rock until
sparks flew out, igniting the brush
around it, thus causing a smoke
screen, under the cover of which
it easily eluded the hungry eagle.
* * * *
“Igloo”: So the Malays cap-
ture sharks by enclosing a piece
of bent bamboo in a mould of
hot fat, and using the fat with
the bamboo inside it as a bait
when it has solidified (B.
4/4/’34). I first read of the
dodge in one of Jules Verne’s
books. He described it as used
by the Eskimos, who employed
bent whalebone in frozen seal blubber
to capture polar bears. That is under-
standable in Arctic conditions. I am
gravelled to imagine how in the climate
of Malaya the fishermen ever get the fat
solid enough to hold the bamboo bent
in a semicircle until the shark swallows
the bait.
* * * *
“Ozab”: Seaweed barometers (B.
7/3/’34)? Perhaps they have given way
to the cards bearing a diamond of chemi-
cally treated celluloid which are being
used for advertising purposes by certain
Brisbane firms. The salt in the seaweed
which absorbed atmospheric moisture is
here superseded by a chemical having the
same sort of affinity for water, but which
responds with a whole gradation of tints,
ranging from yellow through grey and
green to blue, according to the degree of
humidity. The colors assumed by the
diamond indicate practically the whole
range of weathers usually marked on an
aneroid barometer.
jfc ;{«
“Jack’s Track”: I distrust “Wang’s”
quick-growing tree (B. 28 /3 / ’34) that
hoisted a milker overnight, although
I’ve seen the skeleton of a bullock vyced
in the fork of a mountain ash 20ft. above
ground-level. That was in the Kiandra
country, where the snowdrifts are some-
times deeper than that. Trees don’t grow
up in “Wang’s” way. For instance,
fifty years ago a vigorous young
ironbark on my run was mortised for
sliprails without killing the tree ; it has
“How about this 16/20 model, sir?”
“Good Heavens! I want one a bit more modern than that!”
since grown to an enormous height, but
the mortise-holes are exactly the same
distance above ground-level as then. I’ve
drawn the attention of bushmen to it,
but they still maintain that trees do grow
upwards. I hold that the butt of a tree
gets stouter, but never nearer to the stars.
* * * *
“Carrick, A. 8.”: I don’t doubt the
facts behind a yarn like “The Prooshan’s”
(B. 7/3/’34), though as he wrote it up it
sounds a bit improbable.
Every seaman knows what
can be done with the simple
device of rope and blocks
which is known either as a
tackle (pronounced tayckle at
sea) or as a “handy-billy.”
There is an old proverb to
the effect that “a man, a boy
and a handy-billy can rig a
ship.” During one of my
spells ashore I had to grub
out a stump that wouldn’t
burn. Neither tractor nor
horses could move it. I got
over the difficulty by putting
some stout saplings down
the side of the hole to act as
skids, then took the hay rope,
hitched it to the stump and
to a near-by tree and strained
it taut at the hottest part of
the day. That night the rope
was soaked with dew and
shrank; next morning the
stump had moved a few
inches. We chocked it there
and strained the rope again
when it had dried out; next
morning the stump had again
shifted a trifle. In three
weeks’ time, by doing a few
minutes’ work every day, we
had the stump out on level
ground. The tractor did the
rest.

“Agememnon”: Those out-
size worms mentioned by
“Lad” (B. 28 /3 / ’34), pro-
bably Megascolides grandis,
are easily beaten by their
Gippsland cousins of the M.
australis family. Average
length is 6ft., and diameter
three-quarters of an inch.
We used to find them in very
boggy soil, and could actually locate
them by a gurgling, squelching sound
made by the wriggler when slipping
through a fluid secretion with which the
burrow was partially filled.

“W.P.T.”: “King T.” (B 4/4/’34)
wonders why birds build their nests on
the fragile outer limbs of trees. The
chief reason is to protect the young and
the eggs from goannas, snakes and other
natural enemies that climb out on limbs
to raid the birds’ nests. They are unable
to crawl out on the frail limbs, where-
fore they leave the nests alone. The
willy-wagtail builds her nest on a slender
limb, usually overhanging water. Weighty
marauders attempting to climb out on
this limb would force the nest down on
to the water, where it floats; in most
cases the goanna (or whatever it is) over-
balances and falls into the water before
reaching the nest.

“Der Jong”: A recent cable in a
Sydney paper told how a Nairobi man,
pursued by a rhinoceros, fled into the
front door of his bungalow. The rhino,
followed, with the result that the shanty
.was carried on the beast’s back some
distance, and finally became a total loss
from an insurance point of view. I had
a similar experience, but with a happier
ending, while on a shooting-trading trek
at the end of last century in the Zout-
pansberg country, just south of the Lim-
popo. Our ox-team went out with lung-
sick, as they used to call pleuro over
there, and we were stranded in the bush-
veld. While talking things over with my
partner at the rear of the waggon, a big
bull rhino, which had got our wind
charged out of the doornbosch scrub.
We ducked under the waggon and came
out at the other end just as our pursuer
struck the rear axle head down. The
jolt lifted the axle, which passed
over his back and let him into
the space between hind and front
wheels. He threw his head up, driving
both his big horns clean through the
floor of the waggon, the tough boards
holding him a prisoner. In his fury he
pulled the heavy waggon about until
exhaustion stopped him. Hunger helped,
and when we watered and fed him the
second day after he was almost tractable.
It then occurred to us he might supply
the traction-power lost when our oxen
died. He was ready enough to shove
when tickled up from behind, but steer-
ing the waggon was a problem. This we
solved by manning the disselboom, or
pole which controlled the front wheels,
with our “boys,” a dozen or so in
number. These soon learned to utilise
the rhino.’s shoving-power by moving the
boom to right or left. My partner, an
ex-sailor, navigated from the waggon-
box, giving the orders “starboard,”
“port” and so on. We found our captive
more satisfactory than oxen. He was
pleuro-, tsetse- and lion-proof, and all he
wanted to eat was the thornbush which
grew all about. Our ascendancy over
him so impressed the Kaffir kraals with
which we traded that we cleared our
stock at great profit, and decided to call
it a day. The problem then was what to
do with our one r.-p. motor outfit.
Neither of us was willing to tackle the
job of releasing the power-unit from the
chassis, so we sold the entire job to a
young English settler from Tule, just
over the river in Rhodesia. I never
what happened, but I wasn’t surprised
later when Jameson raided the Trans-
vaal as a gesture of protest against some-
thing or other.
THE BIRDIE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“When driving from the fifteenth tee on the
links, a golfer killed a magpie on the fairway.”
It was an ancient golfer man
Sat stopping two or three;
His eyes were wild, his hair unkempt,
And his tears were falling free.
“Oh, what doth ail thee, golfer man?
Why the sad look in thine eye?”
“Alas! Alack! With my steel shaft
l killed a poor magpie.
“I saw it pecking little worms
To carry to its mate.
My drive Hew straight; I shouted ‘Fore’;
The birdie moved too late.
“And now for seven long weary years
I’ve never holed a putt;
The gaping bunkers ope their jaws
And on my ball they shut.
“The cross winds aggravate my slice
Or else prolong my pull;
The kookaburras laugh at me;
My cup of woe is full.
“My, erstwhile friends they pass me by,
For round my neck they see
The phantom form of that piebald bird,
Its sad eyes fixed on me.
“And so, with heart all turned to stone
As the sun begins to sink,
1 sit me down here, all alone,
And think, and think, and think.”
And the sun goes down and the stars come out
All over the Mugwump links,
And still he sits at the nineteenth hole,
And drinks, and drinks, and drinks.

the piano at Melbourne Town Hall he
has been crystal-clear. His Bach on Satur-
day night was a masterpiece of clarity,
and he gave his Scandinavian friend
Grieg an entirely new significance.
His own “Molly on the Shore,” in
which he harmonises an old Irish
air, was full of lovely sounds. More-
over, his programmes explore fields
that Russian and Polish players leave un-
filled. If he plays a Chopin, it is a
Chopin that is little heard. He browses
in early English pastures and opens
volumes of pre-Bach literature on which
undeserved dust has lain for years. In
short, he has bowled over as many Mel-
bourne respectabilities with his fingers
as with his tongue. A stimulating chap!

At Adelaide Repertory’s first short-
play evening, the main piece was the
prize-winner “Rising Mist,” by a local
school-teacher, Joan Kinmont, and it
quite held its own with three imported
playlets. Any. amateur society could wel-
come this eight-character story of the
reprobate who comes home merely to
rid the family of a still less desirable girl
visitor. Don Downey cleverly brought
out the qualities which make the un-
heroic hero detestable to men but
irresistible to women of all ages. A
Molnar trifle was brilliantly talked by
Mimi Mattin and Frederick James.

At Adelaide Royal the Firm is trying
more native musical-comedy heroines.
Isabelle Mahon, at 18, is very small and
fair and appealing, acts well, dances well
and makes the most of a tiny voice.
Dorothy Rankin, at the same age, plays
comic relief impishly and well. (Two
such lightweights have not been seen to-
gether for years.) A “Girl Friend” revi-
val gives Gus Bluett some really fine act-
ing in the “morning after” scene, and Leo
Franklyn holds the stage whenever he
is on it.

“The Beloved Vagabond,” the local
dramatisation of W. J. Locke’s celebrated
novel, is an entirely Australian enter-
prise, and it received a thoroughly Aus-
tralian reception at Melb. Princess on
Saturday night. That is to say, the strik-
ing up of the overture, on which the
composer had evidently lavished a great
deal of care, was selected as a suitable
occasion for Dot Brunton to enter her
box. The applause that this event elicited
from a houseful of heroine-worshippers
having died down, a few more bars of
the composition inserted themselves,
when, by another happy accident, the
Gaud Mayor and his bride entered the
adjoining pen, and the rest of the over-
ture retired behind another prolonged
salvo of applause. The subsequent
appearances of other favorites on the
stage provided excuses for more displays
of public enthusiasm, which were re-
newed every time Gladys Moncrieff
appeared in a new dress. One of these,
a stunning confection of furs and black
silk, caused the dramatic traffic to be
held up so long that the cast appeared
to have been smitten by paralysis. In
short, the evening was a triumph for the
costuming of Buckley and Nunn, the
frocking of Pierre Fornari, the bootings
and shoeings of Coutie, and the hosiery-
ing of Beau Monde. Other items which
..should have got an equal hand were the
ales (Richmond Brewery), the cocktails
(Curzon’s), the cigarettes (Godfrey Phil-
lips) and the gins and liqueurs (W. and
A. Gilbey Pty., Ltd.). These, however,
missed the ’bus of popular acclaim, be-
ing less spectacular, though no doubt just
as reliable. It is only fair to point out
that the music was by the Australian
Dudley Glass and was pretty good, being
light, pleasing, graceful, gay and based
on the sound traditions of the past. The
same may be said of the libretto of
Adrian Ross, who took no more notice
of Mr. Locke than if he had never lived,
but produced a melodrama which started
the audience sizzling at eight and kept
them at passion’s boiling-point, with
momentary lulls, till 11.25. Ashton
Jarry was a masterpiece of insensate vil-
lainy as the financier Comte de Vernet,
who buys Gladys Moncrieff from her
father (Marshall Crosby) for £20,000
and thus compels her lover, the architect
Gaston de Nerac (Robert Chisholm), to
take to the road, accompanied by comic
relief George Wallace. The Don
Quixote-Sancho Panza pair turn up at a
village wedding in Normandy, the ballets
for which were conceived and arranged
by Jennie Brenan, assisted by Margaret
Berry; and very well conceived, too.
Then there was a visit to the rooftops
of Paris, where sundry poverty-stricken
Bohemians, assisted by W. R. Coleman’s
cunningly devised scenic paintings and
F. W. Thring’s bank account, staged an
entertainment of staggering pomp and
circumstance. There was a storm dance
by Eve Alwyn in this scene which
knocked the footling efforts of the
modernist painters into a cocked hat.
There was also an old-fashioned can-can
which showed that the art of the ballet
hasn’t advanced a bit since it stripped.
A slice of the cake which might have
been left to the imagination was Act 111,
Scene 1, “The Garden of Mrs. Rush-
worth’s English Home.”
Little need be said in derogation of
the piece. Gladys’s voice was in the
usual comfortable circumstances, its
callosities being an asset in this sort of
medium, like hard centres in a box of
chocolate creams. Chisholm was a poster
which spelled “Romance” with a throb
in its throat and a certain stiffness in its
gait. His claims to being a misunder-
stood artistic genius were confined to a
bare statement of the fact. Byrl Walkley
was a pert Blanquette. With the com-
plained-of scene omitted or curtailed
“The Beloved Vagabond” should have
one half of Melbourne standing on the
other half’s feet for some time to come.

“Children in Uniform,” a Thring suc-
cess at Melb. Garrick, will be revived at
the Palace on Saturday.
What looked like all the children in the
State assembled at the Town Hall, Mel-
bourne, the , other afternoon to listen
to a programme of symphonic music.
Prof. Heinze provided them with a
mixed bill of edification and entertain-
ment. There were Elgar’s “Pomp and
Circumstance,” two Australian bush
songs by William James —whose suite
holds the field in that domain —Tschai-
kowsky’s “Nutcracker” pieces, a Mozart
flute solo, an air by Grainger, the “Prae-
ludium” of Jarnefelt, Honegger’s “Paci-
fic 231,” and a march by Berlioz. To
most of the programme the youngsters
listened attentively, and they applauded
everything with equal vigor; but they
endured the Honegger imitation of a puff-
puff with marked impatience. The sea
of moving heads looked a flower garden
swept by a tempest.

The Bulletin has no more fault to

v * H-
Large audiences at the Town Hall,
Melbourne, have been telling Percy
Grainger that they like to be talked to
preparatory to listening to the sounds
his fingers make. The notion has its
drawbacks, however. The other evening
he mentioned the cactus plant (Opuntia
vulgaris). The result was that the pre-
sent critic could not get cactus plants
out of his head. Grainger played the
Bach organ Toccata and Fugue in D
Minor, transcribed for the piano, with
considerable address, but in the present
writer’s mind he only succeeded in con-
juring up images of Opuntia vulgaris.
The Franck Prelude, Aria and Prelude,
seemed to be all about C. peruviani, an
aristocratic member of the family which
raises its fleshy stems 50ft. above the
deserts of South America. The Chopin
Polonaise in A Flat seemed to be spiky
and bristly like Echinocactus platyceras,
another member of the tribe whose acid
fruits are used in febrile complaints. By
the end of the evening the critic was sur-
rounded by prickly-pear, and began to
feel the same about it as a farmer in
Q. Percy Grainger is a very interesting
talker, but he ought to keep off botany.
* * *
“Out of the Sea,” by Don Marquis,
presented by the Gregan McMahons
at Melbourne Garrick, is a fish yarn.
It is common to the folklore of
a hundred other places. Set on the dank
coast of Cornwall, where fogs are liable
to arrive daily, it tells the tale of Mark
Tregesal (Norman Wister), a fierce,
masterful, lustful man whose ancestors
are reputed to have been ogres, who
marries Isobel (Coral Brown) who came
out of the sea. Tregesal tries to vivify
the fish-woman, and when he fails he
becomes brutal. An American poet
(Alfred Bristowe) happens along, and
the mermaid falls for him. The
pair plan to escape in a motor-
boat, but Tregesal scents the plot
and tries to terrify the conspirators
into confessing by telling them a fero-
cious tale of what one of his ogre ances-
tors did to a couple in similar circum-
stances. Here the play rises to heights
of murky grandeur, aided by the
good acting of Bristowe and Wister.
The lovers escape that night, but
Tregesal catches them. Isobel kills Tre-
gesal and thereby loses Harding, for that
poet, who, after all, is only a minor
can now only see a murderess in the
place of his mistress.
Coral Brown was the nearest thing to
a flesh-and-blood replica of the late
Joseph Conrad’s one and only heroine
this critic has ever seen presented. Wister,
disguised as George Bernard Shaw in his
forties, was enormously impressive as the
tyrannical Tregesal in those places where
the playwright had put away his fog sig-
nals. Bristowe dramatised the emotions
of the poet with a very fine regard for
the verities. Paul O’Loughlin had the
difficult task of presenting an English
county gentleman who had no place in
Cornwall or any other county, let alone
in Nature. McMahon’s producing was
excellent.

“Lond.”: Marie Tempest has now got
down into the mud in which the London
stage of to-day loves to gambol. The
cynicism of Harwood’s “Old Folks at
Home” is appalling. Marie has a way-
ward married daughter with a possible
lover. As a cure she arranges for the
two to spend a night together—“pushing
the girl over the precipice for fear that
she might slip over it,” as one critic
puts it. Cured she is, and wants to con-
fess all to her husband. “Nonsense!”
says the delightful modernist mother.
“Say nothing. Why, I’ve had a lover
for years, yet I keep your father quite
happy!” The play is of course a huge
success.
“The Dip”: It’s 1000 to 1 that no art
fanatic was responsible for the theft
from the Cathedral of St. Gavon, at
Ghent, of one of the panels of “The
Adoration of the Lamb,” painted in 1432
by the brothers Van Eyck. This is the
first time a Van Eyck has gone missing,
but canvases of Gainsborough, Rem-
brandt, Leonardo da Vinci, Vandyck,
Bellini, Reynolds and others have been
stolen. Almost all were taken by pro-
fessional thieves. Vincenzo Parugia’s
theft of “Mona Lisa” from the Louvre
is the only exception I can recall, and
even that is a doubtful one. Parugia, an
Italian workman, lifted the picture down
from the wall when unobserved, took it
out of its frame, hid it under his blouse,
and coolly walked off with it. Subse-
quently, when he was trying to sell it
in Florence for £20,000, it was recog-
nised by the director of the Florence
Museum. Parugia claimed that patriotism
excused his theft, as there was more
justification for him taking it from
France to Italy than for Napoleon taking
it from Italy to France. /He received
only a nominal punishment. In every
other case a large cash sale was the thief’s
sole object. Your art fanatic isn’t an
active thief, though he is often ready to
buy a purloined canvas.

“Bullionist”: Bank of N. S. Wales re-
organised its book-keeping system shortly
after it got into the new headquarters
office in George-street. It still sticks to
the system of honoring a cheque with
an old client’s name on it without refer-
ence to the ledgers. Its tellers must know
a lot, and I’m inclined to think that the
chap who designed the new filing system
must know something, too. Bang opposite
the first paying-teller's desk is a cabinet
with the inscription “HUN-MARS.”

PRINCE GEORGE’S ADVANCE
AGENT SENDS HIS IMPRESSIONS
TO THE FIFTH EQUERRY.
IV.—Perth.
His Highness will be glad to see this
place, particularly if he has had rough
weather from Colombo.
It is situated on the Swannee Ribber,
just alongside King’s Park. I haven’t
seen any cotton fields yet, but perhaps
it isn’t the right season.
I have heard that this State intends
to secede from the Commonwealth, and
it is suggested that they may offer the
throne to Prince George. His Highness
would be well advised to refuse it. Quite
apart from creating unpleasantness in his
family circle, it wouldn’t be fair to Nor-
folk Island and Antigua.
Besides, he’d have to stay here.
You had better advise the Prince that
in his speeches it will be quite safe to
use the phrases “ties of Empire” and
“bonds of kinship,” but he’d better not
mention “this glorious Commonwealth.”
He must not forget to express admira-
tion for St. George’s-terrace. He won’t
have any trouble in finding it. It is the
street with the large building in it, and
making allowance for a bend or so it
runs right past King’s Park.
Everyone is anxious to show him the
University, which is the only free one
in the Empire. It is quite full, and there
is some talk of introducing a quota sys-
tem to limit the influx of Scotch stu-
dents. The ’Varsity is not far from
King’s Park.
► The Kalgoorlie people are anxious to
see the Prince, and are preparing an
illuminated address printed in 29 differ-
ent languages.
Kalgoorlie is one of the best residen-
tial suburbs of Perth, and many of the
homes have been entirely rebuilt lately.
Its only drawback is that it is rather a
long way from King’s Park.
The last member of the British no-
bility to visit Perth was Lord Thornton,
who, I am told, captivated everyone by
his grace and charm, and found the city
very hospitable. He was impressed with
the beauty of King’s Park.
Other things the Prince must not miss
are “the trots,” the Fremantle Flier and
the 8.50 p.m. stampede from the pictures.
By the way, Perth has had her cen-
tenary, and has nothing to look forward
to for another 95 years. That is pro-
bably why she wants to secede.
Quite a lot of people find Perth en-
durable. Particularly if they have had
to spend an hour or so in Fremantle
before going there.

FIGHTING THE MANIMAL.
At the annual conference of mos-
quitoes, held this month, past-president
Anopheles urged:
“That present restrictive measures for
coping with the man-pest are inadequate
and that a more
militant policy is
necessary.
“That a trial ship-
ment of malaria
germs should be
obtained and a
few experienced
malarial mosqui-
toes should be in-
vited to accom-
pany them on an
instructional cru-
sade.
“That flies should
be asked to co-
operate in destroy-
ing the manimal.
If they were to
scramble in gar-
bage before bath-
ing in milk-jugs,
wading in jam and
biting human be-
ings in vulnerable
places, their assist-
ance would be in-
valuable.
“That the secre-
tary of the Fleas’
Friendly Society be
asked to communi-
cate with the Bu-
bonic Plague Dis-
tribution Bureau
for the purpose of obtaining large quan-
tities of the virus for local dissemina-
tion.”
In the course of a brief address, the
president, Mr. Myrmex Gigans, said that,
“Unimpeded by insect activity, human
beings had increased alarmingly. It was
necessary to keep pace with the times.
Prehistoric man was content to kill in-
sects by hand, but nowadays fly-papers,
diabolical powders and liquid sprays
were in general use and killed billions
daily. It was therefore essential that
not a moment of good stinging weather
should be wasted.
“Every insect, when launching an attack
upon man, should be sure that its germ-
carrying capacity was being utilised to
the full extent. The various tribes
should sink their differences and combine
in massed attacks upon the common foe.
Only by good teamwork was it possible
for the best results to be obtained.”
The meeting was unanimous in its
approval.

ANOTHER M.C.C. OUTRAGE!
“Wall was in bed two days suffering from

The cable omits to mention why this
infant emissary from Lord’s was allowed
to pester our fast bowler for two days,
and who eventually had the sense to eject
it from the sufferer’s bed. Debarred from
bodylining, the English now, seemingly,
propose to rely on bedlining. And they
talk of our barrackers!
Hillite.
JUSTIFIED.
“Had he shot the owner of the wireless set
instead of the concierge, acquittal would have
been almost certain.” —Paris cable.
The jury was obviously moved by
counsel’s address.
“The wireless set went on and on,” he
thundered. “It went through the trade
reports, gramophone selections, the race
results, band music—all the items, you
know, gentlemen—from six in the morn-
ing.
“The sound of other sets in competi-
tion could be heard, each broadcasting
the programmes from other stations. My
client endured; he felt himself going
“Mary, you’ve mixed the boots up. I got a black one an’
a tan one.”
" Cripes, that funny. Secon’ time that bin happen this
mornin’!”
mad. He did not know who owned the
wireless set; he only knew that the care-
taker was responsible for allowing it to
go on and on —and on —like that!
“And then came the final outrage. The
‘Piccaninnies’ Session,’ gentlemen! The'
madness he had been fighting became too
strong for him. Could he be expected
to reason exactly who should be killed?
The plain fact was that someone de-
served to die. Surely my client can be
excused for a slight error!”
Without retiring the jury returned a
verdict of “not guilty,” adding a rider
“that the accused has set a splendid
example in the fight for the freedom of
the people.”

HONEYMOON'S END.
Dream not of days when Love was
young,
Nor of that night of bliss
When your soft mouth to my mouth
clung
In an unending kiss.
Dream not of tender words, my dear,
Borne on a lover’s sigh;
Words breathed by me in yopr pink
ear— s
Lovers so often lie.
Don’t try to snuggle here all day,
A slave to reverie,
But rise and, without more delay,
Get me my morning tea!

STILL ILLICIT.
“An American who used an illicit still said
he thought that it was now legal.”
When rye was by the law forbid
He turned to his illicit still;
Down in a cellar safely hid
In secret he could drink his fill.
Then came the happy day! Amid
The cheering throng he drank at will
(Of Prohibition’s nightmare rid;
The law repealed for good or ill).
He gaily raised the cellar lid,
But found it was illicit still.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Moorefield lived up to its reputation
as the punters’ paradise on Saturday
when the seven races were won by well-
backed horses, the longest price being
fives. Diamond, Veilantif, Rosaban and
Caravel Girl were favorites to score,
while Journal and Ramrod were second
choices, each being well supported.
• • • • •
The w.f.a. Maiden Plate was voted the
best of good things for the Dominion-
owned but Randwick-trained Diamond
(evens), a big leggy colt by Sir John’s
sire, Limond, from Leta. Diamond gave
McCarten an easy ride. After shaking off
Wuiruna at the turn, he won easily from
Joan Moa and the outsider Aripiles.
Diamond is bred to stay, but he gets up
so high, with such an extravagant action,
that he may find it hard to win at over
jYiilc.
The Maiden Juvenile for colts and
geldings and a similar event for fillies
proved highly successful. Silver King
(fives), a speedy-looking colt by the
Argentine El Cacique from Silver Wed-
ding, won his division in really good
style from D’Airain and the favorite,
Paragon. The latter, trained by Frank
Dalton, was so badly away that he, did
well to get among the prize-money. He
is rather a small colt by Heroic from
Love Sign.

Nightjar had done nothing to justify
her opening as favorite for the fillies’
division, but she must have been tried
extra well. The daughter, of Night
Raid, bred in Maoriland, showed a
lot of pace, but found Leslie Barnett’s
Caravel Girl (threes) too seasoned. The
Rosehill-trained filly beat her cleverly,
with Gay Lass, one of Dan Seaton’s own
breeding, a close third. Lady Glitter,
trained by ex-jockey Percy Maher, was
a good fourth.
Veilantif, who carries the colors of
A.J.C. committeeman A. W. Thompson
and Cecil Oatley, was turned out in capi-
tal trim by Chris O’Rourke for the first
division of the Highweight. She was
always favorite, and, starting at 7 to
2, led throughout, to score from the 20-
to-1 chance Nachara, with Charalf third.
Mulligan took no risks with the favorite,
and kept her going right to the judge.
The second division was reckoned as
a gift for Rosaban, a plain-looking chest-
nut by Arachne’s sire, Corban, from the
Malster mare St. Rosaline. Starting at
5 to 4 on after twos had been laid,
Rosaban was pulling Darcy Webb out
of the saddle at the half-mile. When
Webb slipped the wraps, it was all over,
the gelding winning easily from Won-
drous and Zippor.
Dermid’s class was expected to be the
dominating factor in the Moorefield
Handicap. However, the Cantala winner
is not improving with age, and after get-
ting a good run on the rails at the half-
mile he failed to last out the easy ten
furlongs. Journal (7 to 2) made a fast
run up the hill, to score easily from the
outsider Juliet Glass, with Dermid a neck
away.
Ramrod, a stable-mate of Veilantif, had
a runaway win in the Hurstville Mile,
being backed from 6’s to 4’s. Persian,
who has been racing consistently of late,
found his Bst. 131 b. too much. He looked
a winner when he swung into the straight
with a nice lead. However, apprentice
Stan Payne, who deserves more oppor-
tunities, dashed Ramrod away at the
Leger, and the rest was a procession.
Barrier King, unwisely ridden from be-
hind, was third. Touchit, a supposed rod
in pickle, faded out in the run home.
* * * *
Melbourne race meetings last week
were marred by rain. Mentone club had
a bad spin at the week-end. Parts of
the course were under water when the
stipes made an official inspection at 1
o’clock on Saturday, but it was decided
to go on with the fixture. After half
the programme had been disposed of
rain set in again, and it was almost im-
possible to see the colors of the jockeys.
However, there were no accidents, and
punters returned home satisfied, five first
favorites having caught the judge’s eye.
Etymology was a strong pick for the
Open Hurdle, and won with a lot to
spare, the other places being filled by
Llangollen and First Wood. He belongs
to H. E. Connolly, who won the V.R.C.
Grand National Hurdle of 1924 with
Jackstaff. There isn’t much chance of
Etymology rising to Jackstaff’s stand-
ard. The latter could gallop, and finished
second to Accarak in the Australian Cup
a few months before he won over the
battens. The Connolly brothers like
jumpers. Eric laid the foundations of
his success as an owner-trainer by taking
the Grand National Steeple of 1904 with
The General. Whereas E. A. Connolly
is wholly occupied with racing, his
brother just dabbles in it, most of his
time being occupied with business.
The hurdle didn’t throw light on the
coming Grand Nationals. So dissatis-
fied was F. E. Shillabeer with the failure
of Walter Scott that he may send the
Kenilworth gelding up for sale. Earlier
in his career Walter Scott looked the type
to win a National Hurdle, but he is now
being weighted at over 12st. It gives
him no chance. Fred Hoysted gave
Plum King his first outing over
hurdles at Mentone. The King’s
Treasure horse whipped-in the field, but
he got round safely. Illured led until
he fell at the back of the course in the
second circuit. He may win later for
Jack O’Dwyer.
There is a growing feeling that Our
Comet will have to be reckoned with in
the Grand National Hurdle. He beat a
smart field of hurdlers at Caulfield on
April 14, putting up a course record.
On Saturday Our Comet was favorite for
the Mentone Purse, of one mile 2jfur.
Ridden a waiting race by Frank Demp-
sey, he shot up on the home turn and
scored by three lengths from Harold
Skidmore’s mount, Dah, with Highardo
third. Our Comet is improving in both
speed and stamina, and cannot be faulted
with regard to jumping ability. Dempsey
completed a double by his Purse success.
He took the previous event, the Mentone
Plate, on L’Elite, who romped home.
Sally’s Robe put in a long run to finish
second.
Divisions of the Two-year-old Handi-
cap went to Drakella (Drake —Green-
ella) and Geyser (Windbag—Oboe) re-
spectively. Neglected in the betting,
Drakella led all the way and beat the
favorite, Ivon, by half a length. Geyser
started at evens and scored easily. She
belongs to A. G. Hunter, the Seymour
studmaster, and is a half-sister to Rose
Mignon, who performed well as a sprin-
ter at the autumn carnival. T. M. Burke
imported Geyser’s dam from England.
With Geyser’s victory Lou Robertson, the
Mordialloc trainer, broke a long run of
bad luck. Segati, whose win at Caulfield
on April 14 created such surprise,
was the last of five horses to finish
in the Mentone Handicap, which High-
way took in hollow style. Originally
Highway was owned in Sydney by the
late F. Marsden. Seignor Grande, a
three-year-old colt by Dignity, who died
recently, won the Welter Handicap in
pouring rain.
* * * *
“Durdans”: “Togo” Johnstone, the
N.S.W. jockey, won his first important
race in England last week, when he
steered the unbeaten colt Colombo home
in the Craven Stakes for three-year-olds
at Newmarket. What the punters think
of Lord Glanely’s 510-guinea bargain can
be seen from the fact that he went out
at 100 to 30 on, though he was humping
9st. 81b. over a mile. Colombo is a
red-hot favorite for the Two Thousand,
run on May 2, and for the Derby. John-
stone has the mount in both races.
* * * *
Andrew Chirnside, dead in Melbourne
at 81, was one of the men who founded
the V.A.T.C. in 1875. The first meeting
was held at Ballarat, and the first Gold
Cup Steeple was run there and won by
the deceased on his own horse, Sailor,
who repeated the trick at Caulfield the
next year. For years he was associated
with the V.A.T.C. committee, and bred
many good horses, including Clean
Sweep, winner of the Melbourne Cup in
1900, and Hymettus, who took the Caul-
field Cups of 1898 and 1901. A fine
horseman, he hunted much in England in
his younger days, and made a name also
as a big-game shot in Africa.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
“Whiskers” Blake (15st.) and Joe Gotch
(15st. 61b.) furnished entertainment at
Leichhardt Stadium last Saturday night
—the bearded comedian pleasing more
than his opponent. Blake outwrestled
the bulkier Gotch at. all times, and he
seemed certain to win when his flying
body-scissors scored a fall in round three.
Gotch became annoyed, however, and a
right to the chin floored Blake, after
which he was pinned in the fifth. Stand-
ing overarm headlocks gave Blake a lead
early in the last, but he weakened, and
Gotch won by two falls to one.
* * * *
Tom Lurich carried his funny business
too far at Newtown, where he opposed
George Penchiff in an hour-limit wrestle,
and was disqualified for biffing the
referee after battling 39min. without a
break. Lurich mostly appeared to be
wrestling the referee, and the official
threatened to disqualify him if he did
not pay more attention to Penchiff. An-
other right then landed on the referee s
ribs, and the Russian was declared loser
on a foul.

The second round of the Sydney Rugby
Union grade games saw Manly and
Randwick the only teams unde-
feated to date. Manly beat revived
Parramatta on the latter’s ground, but
had no walkover, though scores read
18-0 at the last whistle. The visitors
scored three tries, Ross converting them
and adding a penalty goal. Parramatta s
showing was excellent, especially as the
side lost Martin, the very efficient full-
back, early in the second half. Manly
still looks short of a gallop, some of the
forwards being much above themselves.
Kelaher and Ross were the best of the
backs. Parramatta, in addition to Mar-
tin, has a couple of good ones in McCor-
mick and Park. Lehman and Yonge
ably abetted Cerutti in the home pack.
After the University forwards, helped
by the gale at Coogee, had held Rand-
wick to a 3-0 score at half-time, the
Greens fairly took wing down wind in the
second spell to win 22-0. Forward and
back, Randwick was at top form, as
against Northern Suburbs last week.
The University backs, well fed by the
3-4-1 scrum formation, were a poor lot
on the day, though Rankin did what he
could at centre. Kennedy might as well
have been at the boatrace for all the
chances he got. At Concord, Eastern
Suburbs went down 3-6 to Western. The
game was hard and ragged, combination
being poor. Western scored a try and
a p.g., Eastern a p.g.
At North Sydney, the locals won from
St. George 30-15. Northern showed
more life in the ruck than in the game
with Randwick, though the Saints’ van-
guard packed and scrummaged well. The
Northern backs turned the scale and were
operating freely in the second spell.
Winners scored six tries to four. Cowper
converted three of Northern’s tries, while
he and Young each added a p.g. Drum-
moyne and Navy played the bye at
Drummoyne, the home side prevailing
17-6.

Sydney Rugby League’s opening this
season took the form of a match between a
team of Kangaroos and the Rest of N.S.W.
at Sydney Sports Ground. Faced by a
stiff wind, the ex-tourists had some
trouble in shaking down during the first
half against the strong opposition, and
came off at half-time 4 points down, with
scores 12-8. There was a different story
after the change-over, and, picking up
their combination, the Kangaroos romped
over the opposition in the closing stages.
Final scores were 35-12, the Kangaroos
scoring 7 tries plus 6 conversions and a
p.g. by Brown, whose kicking was such
a feature of the tour in England. The
Rest crossed the opposition line twice,
Robinson adding three p.gs. Half-
backs Hey and Thicknesse gave an out-
standing display in the Kangaroo backs.
The game was an unlucky one for the
Kangaroo three-quarter C. Pearce, who
broke his leg. The match was a benefit
for J. J. Giltinan, founder of the profes-
sional code in N.S.W.
(<Continued on next page.)
The Head of the River racing between
the Q.P.S. crews on the Parramatta fur-
nished plenty of surprises this year The
heats for fours and eights at mid-week
saw the once mighty St. Joseph’s out of
everything, while Scots acquired un-
accustomed lustre with places in both
fours and eights. Saturday’s finals
were rowed in a howling westerly
which raised a heavy chop, which was
fortunately mostly a following one.
In the eights, Grammar, boated in their
heavy and weatherly practice eight, came
home two lengths ahead of the greatly-fan-
cied Shore, which had won its heat in such
slashing style on Wednesday. Grammar’s
time, with the wind behind, was 7min.
38|sec., a record for the race, beating
its own 1917 record by B|sec. All the
crews struck misfortune, crabbing being
general in the rough water, but Shore’s
cup of bitterness was a full one. Coming
down to the laneway No. 7 broke poppet
string and thole pin, and the consequent
crab stopped the boat. Recovering,
Shore set out after Grammar again, but
then No. 2 broke the poppet string and
lost his oar overboard, leaving Shore to
finish with seven men rowing. A strong
Grammar spurt landed the black and
gold over the line two lengths ahead of
bnore, with Sydney High and Scots fol-
lowing them home. Grammar also took
the first fours from High and Scots,
while Shore, Grammar and Scots filled
the nrst three places in the second fours.

“Fitzcray”: The confusion over the
reintroduction of the “flick pass” to Aus-
tralian Rules football (B. 11 / 4/’34) con-
tinues. The rule says that the pass is
made by holding the ball clearly in one
hand and hitting it with the other. Since
every player has his own idiosyncrasy,
there are already nine and forty ways
of performing the operation, and things
are not improved by the fact that all the
umpires have their idiosyncrasies also.
The obvious way out of the tangle
would be to allow the player to throw
the ball. But that would be taking a
leaf from the rule book of the accursed
Rugby game, a “foreign” institution
which is anathema to all good Australian
Rulers, especially in Melbourne.
* * * *
“Poacher”: Undeterred by the black
looks and blacker language of its neigh-
bor football States, Victoria goes serenely
on with its old game of buying up all
the young talent trained over its borders.
Westralia, which for some years has been
at open war with the Yarrasiders, is
again refusing clearances to some of its
players engaged to go east. “Unsports-
manlike” is the word applied by the
enraged Gropers to the action of the Cab-
bage Gardeners in signing up these men
when they were engaged in the inter-
state tourney in Sydney last year. South
Australia and Tasmania are airing their
grievances also, and with as little effect.
The cradle-snatchers excuse their action
by saying that in offering jobs in Mel-
bourne to players to transfer they are
often finding employment for out-of-
works.
He He * *
“Rover”: N.S.W. Australian Rules
footballers had been hoping for a visit
to Sydney this year by a Victorian team,
and, in view of the excellent showing
made at the big inter-State carnival on
Sydney Cricket Ground last season by
the home side, such a trip looked a pay-
able proposition. Victoria, always not-
able for talking about the extension of
the game in other States, and for doing
little else but talk, has turned the sug-
gestion down. It is a fool policy, for
regular inter-State fixtures are far the
best means of advertising the game and
improving its standard, as the Rugby
codes have shown. However, Ma is pull-
ing the wires in order to bring one of
the Melbourne clubs to Sydney for a
match on August 11.
“Hotham": Victorian Rugby followers
are keenly disappointed that the All
Blacks are not to include Melbourne in
their short Australian tour. There is a
movement now afoot to bring over a
Maori side to play in Melbourne and
elsewhere. As far as N.S.W. and Queens-
land are concerned there will be no room
for such a visit this season, with its
crowded inter-State and inter-Dominion
programme. Victoria might work it in
partnership with South Australia, but
costs would be heavy. In any case, the
Victorians are getting in early to be-
speak a match with the 1935 All Blacks
on their way to Britain, and have worded
M.L. on the subject.
* * * #
“Stand Off”: At the annual meeting of
the M.L. Rugby Union the other day
chairman S. S. Dean announced that an
Imperial Rugby conference was being
arranged which, he hoped, would
straighten out the differences between the
British Unions and some of their over-
seas brethren. The conference will pro-
bably be held in London in 1936, and it
is likely that W. W. Hill, president of
the N.S.W.R.U., will speak for the Aus-
tralian Unions. The kick-into-touch-rule
question will certainly be an outstanding
item on the agenda, and a better under-
standing of conditions in M.L. and Aus-
tralia should induce the diehards of the
British Unions to extend a special dispen-
sation in this respect to the All Blacks
and ourselves, at least.
* * * *
“Bowen Park”: Queensland Rugby
has lost two good men recently. Both
are Wallaby forwards. Graham Cooke,
of Toowoomba, a tropical weakling of
some 15 stone, who was one of the
Australian stars in South Africa, is
returning to that country. He is
to take up a mining billet on the Rand.
His fellow-scrummager, “Bimbo” White,
is now at Sydney University and playing
with the Blue and Gold team. He will
be unlucky if he misses the N.S.W. side
against his native State. If he plays he
will not be the first man by a long chalk
from the northern State who has changed
his colors from maroon to light blue by
way of Sydney Uni.
* * * *
“Gate”: How heavily the metropolitan
section of the N.S.W. Rugby League has
suffered by the flitting of its players
to the country, where jobs of various
sorts have been found for them in order
to coach or play with country teams, is
seen by the League’s report that the
Country League has registered 160 trans-
fers from the city. In accordance with a
new rule, these men will be all duly
docketed as “professionals,” though the
fact that they are R.L. players makes
them that already.
* * * *
“Shelf”: The Brisbane Rugby League
disqualified a player for life the other
day. He was charged with fighting
and refusing to leave the ground when
ordered by the referee. The report
indicates that the official was to
blame for part of the trouble, since
he allowed the player to remain and the
game to go on. He should have appealed
to the offender’s captain and, failing help
from him, should have walked off the
field and cancelled the match.
* * * *
“Rus”: From now until the middle of
May the divisions of the newly-formed
N.S.W. Country Football League will
meet in tests to select two teams to visit
Sydney for Country Week. These will
be chosen by May 15, and will be in
Sydney by May 22. On May 26 the
country championships will be settled,
and a game against a metropolitan side
follows.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Sandringham”: Melbourne’s annual
tournament between the old boys of the
G.P.S. is a function which might be
copied with advantage in some other
Australian capitals. This time Ivo Whit-

he had lost none of his old magic by
winning the individual championship for
the fifth year in succession. Fairbairn,

“Woodlands”: The Dunlop Cup, one
of Victoria’s most coveted pro. golf
prizes went this year to E. Naismith, of
Heidelberg. His four rounds totalled
294 —average, 73.5 per round. A 70 over
the West Course was a stroke worse than

N.S.W. H. Boorer, holder of the Cup,
was unable to defend his trophy through

“Sandringham”: The Australian L.G.
Council has circularised some 30 of Aus-
tralia’s leading golferinas throughout the
States with an eye to the selection of five
of them to knock spots off their Maori-
land opposite numbers in the course of a
tour of the North Island. The time avail-
able will not permit the crossing of Cook
Strait, but, as a test against the All Blacks
is to be played on the Titirangi links at
Auckland, no doubt some of the south-
erners will be present.
* * * *
“Hoylake”: As far as is officially
known, Australasia will be represented
in big British golf this year only by the
two Maoriland lasses, Oliver Kay and
Betty Gaisford. As Australian cham-
pion, the Kay may shed some lustre on
this country if she scores well in the
women’s events on the other side. But
several Australiennes of lesser golfing
tonnage are reported to be prowling
about Merrie England just now. The
cables announce that the Braithwaite
sisters, of Victoria, and the Barclay ditto,
of Tassie, were playing last week in the
Birkdale (Lancashire) tournament, and
that the Victorians had survived the
second round. All are well-known
golferettes, but none is in the champion-
ship class.

“O Sole Mio”: Mussolini is a cap-
able chap, but many will agree with the
writer that he has taken on a stiff con-
tract in ordering the abolition of all Brit-
ish golf terms for clubs within his baili-
wick. Only Italian words are to be used
in future, and no foreigners will be
allowed to act as officials of an Italian
golf club. Non-Italian players will pay
a special tax to get an identity card per-
mitting them to play on Italian courses.
The change will mean the loss of many
jobs, since, in Italy, as elsewhere on the
Continent, that indispensable lad the
club secretary is invariably a Briton.
Even considering that, my heart bleeds
for the Italian officials who will have to
find Italian equivalents for golfing terms.
More than that, how are they going to
play the game properly without the safety
valves which only the English language
affords? What is the Italian for “***! !
and *!* the caddie,” to take only
one mild example?
* * * *
“Carnoustie”: One of the Olympians
of golf turned in his last card recently
at the St. Andrews, where his whole golf-
ing life from caddiedom had been spent.
“Andra” Kirkcaldy was the legitimate
successor to “Old” and “Young” Tom
Morris, and worthily carried on the tradi-
tion of those golf demigods. Like all
his kind, a wonderful “character,” he was
a tremendous favorite with American
visitors to St. Andrews, though not so
popular with local citizens who had felt
the rasp of his Scottish tongue. One of
the great players of the game, Andra
never won an open, though he tied and
lost for that of 1889. He was 73 at
the end.
Car and Cycle
“Differential”: Some time ago The
Bulletin described an Australian-built
car which is unique in that it is chassisless.
It is entirely built up of plywood, with
the exception of the engines and power-
transmitting units. The first experiment
in this direction dates back to 1921, and
models have been experimented with ever
since.- One model has done over 200,000
miles on Australian roads to date with
satisfactory results. The cars are made
in Sydney, and 200 will be ready for
marketing by July; it is expected that
the monthly output will be the same. At
present no plant has been laid down,
the parts being made by various firms
under contract. There is an assembling
plant at Newtown. Everything in the
car will be Australian made, save the
carburetter and dashboard gadgets,
which will be imported from Britain.
Kingsford Smith is chairman of direc-
tors of the manufacturing company.

“Cot Case”: Those who have been
bowled over by motor-cars, and the multi-
tude which lives in daily terror of play-
ing lead in a car-pedestrian clash, may be
interested in some figures regarding the
“damage capacity” of cars which have
been strung together by an English ex-
pert. A car moving at 20 m.p.h. hits a
footslogger with the same force as if it
had fallen off a building 13.4 ft. high.
At 40 m.p.h. the height of the building
is raised to 53.3 ft., and at 60 the impact
equals that of a car diving off a height
of 120.3 ft. The figures, especially the
decimals, are interesting, and the perusal
and checking of them should afford
agreeable relaxation to casualties in hos-
pital who have reached the convalescent
stage.
* * * *
“Formula”: The cutting of the motor
horse-power tax in the latest British Bud-
get should give a tremendous lift to the
motor industry in Britain and gladden the
“Cripes! If they gave me tools like that to work with I’d go on strike.”
hearts of car-owners, who for years have
carried a burden imposed in no other
country. The very high-powered car in
Britain has for years been available to
the prosperous only, while the medium
grades, so popular elsewhere, were only
within reach of fairly well-to-do people.
The 25 p.c. cut, while making little
difference in the case of the big fellows,
should help the demand for the middle-
graders. At the same time, it should
not be forgotten that this h.p. tax spurred
English engineers to evolve that uniquely
British and most efficient job the small
car.
* * * *
“Macedon”: The bitter cry of Queens-
land motor-cyclists to come over there
with the annual Australian T.T. race
once in a while (B. 11/4/’34) is likely to
bear fruit. It is argued that, if Tassie can
be given a look-in at a show of the kind,
then Queensland, which has much more
room to spare, deserves a turn, and the
claim has been backed by the recent
victory of Bananalander Anderson in this
year’s event at Bathurst (N.S.W.). As
the 1935 meeting has already been set
down for Phillip Island in Victoria, the
northerners are putting in their claim
for 1936. N.S.W. is said to be in favor,
but Victoria, South Australia and Tassie
will take some converting, on past per-
formances.
Racquet and Bawl
“Centre Court”: The Australian Davis
Cup team, which landed in England this
week, paired off for the doubles while on
board ship in view of the hard-court
championships at Bournemouth on
Monday next. For this tournament, at
any rate, the teams will be Crawford
and McGrath, and Quist and Turnbull.
Australia will field only one mixed team,
Turnbull and Joan Hartigan, and they
will also play together in the French
championships. Following Bournemouth,
the team has been asked to play in an
international tourney at Amsterdam, and
will probably accept if the money is
good.
* * * *
“Centre Court”: The Australians will
meet tough opposition on their opening
appearance at the Bournemouth hard-
court tourney, which opens on April 30.
The entry is an international one, if one
excepts German and American players.
Among the stars are Perry, Austin, Lee,
Rogers (Ireland), Prenn, Kirby (S.
Africa), Boussus and Merlin (France),
Malfroy (M.L.) and the Japanese Davis
Cup team.
“Susie Swattit”: It would seem that
every day in every way tennis is getting
brighter and brighter. I am moved to
this conclusion by the cabled news that
Mrs. Fearnley Whittingstall paralysed the
enraptured onlookers at Melbury (Eng.)
tennis tournament by turning out in pale-
blue linen shorts with bodice to match.
That’s not all, girls! The shorts wer.e
deeply pleated and had three pearl but-
tons on each sleeve. The perfectly ducky
confection was finished off with a pearl
buckle confining the waistband.
* * * *
“Raus Mit”: Germany continues to
take its alleged Jewish menace seriously.
In the Hun tennis ranking list for 1933
the name of D. Prenn, No. 1 in 1932,
does not appear. Prenn is not a Jew,
although one of his forebears was. Von
Cramm is promoted to first place, and
the others named are of no particular
importance. With Prenn in, Germany
could boast a formidable pair, but the
team is now a one-man show to all
intents and purposes. Prenn, forbidden
to play for Germany, competed at
Wimbledon and in the French champion-
ships last year.
* * * *
“Kooyong”: There doesn’t seem to be
anything definite as yet about the visit
of overseas players to Melbourne at the
end of the year for a special centenary
tournament. One of the South Africans,
V. G. Kirby, says he is willing, but there
is a string to it. He wants Australia to
pay his expenses to America, where he
proposes to go first before coming on to
this country, in addition to those for the
Australian end of the trip. He was
ranked third in South African tennis last
year, with Robbins and Farquharson
ahead of him. He is a fine doubles
player. In last year’s Davis Cup match
with the Australians Kirby surprised by
beating McGrath 3-1 in the opening
rubber.
Miscellaneous
“Blade”: Most of the State crews
are now on their way to Hobart for the
King’s Cup, rowed on the Derwent on
May 5. By the look of things, N.S.W.
and Westralia will be the only States to
boat composite crews. Queensland has
sent down the State champions, G.P.S.
club ; Victoria’s representatives will be
practically the Nagambie club; South
Australian State champions, Berri, will
row for the Central State; while Tassie
will be championed by the Derwent club
crew. The next of the big rowing events
will be the inter-universities’ race at
Mannum (S.A.) on June 2. Tasmania
and Queensland will not appear. Sydney
holds the Oxford-Cambridge Cup. Wes-
tralia, the previous holder, did not com-
pete in N.S.W. last year, but will be at
Mannum. Sydney has won 16 of the
42 races rowed to date.
* * * *
“Toowong”: Queensland Rowing
Association, which has been making an
ass of itself for some time in its dealings
with affiliated clubs, went in off the deep
end last week at a Brisbane regatta. Be-
cause they had not paid up their quota
for sending a crew to Hobart for the
King’s Cup, the Q. R. Ass. instructed
regatta officials to take no notice of the
G.P.S. and Brisbane R.C. crews. Brisbane
didn’t start, but the G.P.S. boated two
fours, both of which won their events
by lengths. The judge didn’t see them,
however, and awarded the races to the
second crews. By way of pointing the
joke, the eight from the banned G.P.S.
club, which won the right to represent
Queensland in the King’s Cup at Hobart
on May 5, departed a couple of days later
for Tassie amid general approbation from
everyone but the Q.R.A.
* * * *
“Topping Lift”: Launched at Gosport
last week, the English challenger for the
America’s Cup (not America Cup). Her
name is Endeavour. Steel for the
most part, she differs from her pre-
decessors by having a centreboard
dropping through her 82-ton lead keel.
Overall the Endeavour is 128 ft. and
at the waterline 83ft., with a 15ft.
draught. The hollow steel mast is 170 ft.
high and the boom 122 ft. Her Bermuda
mainsail will measure 4850 sq. ft. and the
two foresails 2700 sq. ft.—7550 sq. ft. in
all. Owner is T. O. M. Sopwith, of
aeroplane fame. He will skipper her
himself, with the usual professional crew.
She will sail in the big English regattas
until July, when she is to snug-down for
the trip across the Atlantic for the Cup
races. They begin on September 15.
* * * *
The Australian Eleven begins its fate-
ful tour of Britain next week with a
match against Worcestershire. The 1930
team also started against the sauce
county, and had a very easy run, winning
by an innings and 165. Bradman gave
the Englishmen an early taste of his
quality with 236, skipper Woodfull tot-
ting up 133. Grimmett was the best of
the Australian bowlers with 9 wickets
for 84.

THE OTHER FELLOW’S MIND.
Leaving the Land
Young men like myself, reared on the
Westralian wheat country, are leaving it
disheartened. Why? Because profitable
production of wheat is impossible under
existing conditions. I had enough to
pay for a passage to Melbourne, so my
recent youthful associates regard me with
envy. But if Australian statesmen are not
an extinct race, they will have to make
it worth the while of young men bred
on the land to stay there. — Curragh
(Vic.).
Capital Punishment
Mr. Fihelly’s paragraph (B. 28/3/’34)
does more credit to his heart than to
his head.
Here is a case on which I, as a member
of the N.S.W. State Cabinet, had to give
a decision. A man from the back coun-
try came down to Newcastle and booked
berths for himself and a woman on a
sailing-boat leaving a week or two sub-
sequently for South America. He then
went back to his home, poisoned his
wife, and got away on the vessel. For-
tunately we were able to intercept him,
and he paid for the life he took with
his own. Would Mr. Fihelly say that
punishment was unjustified?
Here’s another. A witness in a recent
bashing outrage testified that he over-
heard one of the men who were kicking
in the face of a prostrate victim say to
the other, “Pull off, Jim, or you’ll croak
the swine, and he ain’t worth swingin’
for.” Had there been no “swingin’ ” in
prospect they undoubtedly would have
continued “putting in the boot” until
they “croaked” their unfortunate victim.
Mr. Fihelly must know that in every
community on earth there is a residuum
of callous criminals, very small numeri-
cally, I hope, but still existent, who re-
gard imprisonment with indifference, and
who fear only physical suffering to them-
selves either by the lash or the rope.
Society must protect itself from creatures
of this type, stad can only do so by in-
sisting on the Mosaic dictum, “He that
sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his
blood be shed.”
When murder is the result of uncon-
trollable passion or impulse Executives
don’t hang.— Arthur Griffith (N.S.W.).
“Lover of Justice”:
J. A. Fihelly’s statement (B. 28/3/’34) that
in 80 p.c. of murders there is no premeditation
is absurd. I would say that at least 80 p.c.
of murders are premeditated or suggested by
that “pack-horse of sin” opportunity. Where
a criminal acts, as we say, on the spur of the
moment, he invariably acts on principles ger-
mane to his nature and along lines that have
been followed many times in his own mind.
It is so in other matters. A horsy person,
apparently on the spur of the moment, asked
what I would take for a horse he happened
to see on my place. I did not know him as
a horse-dealer, and I asked him what he would
do with the animal if I did sell. He answered:
“I practically always have a horse sold before
I buy it.” The argument that the death
penalty doesn’t discourage murder is equally
silly. Certain, swift and adequate punishment
is a deterrent. Witness the difference between
the British and American, homicide statistics;
the explanation being that in England it is
odds on a murderer being hanged, in the
U.S.A. long odds against.
These Tax-gatherers!
The whole of my income for the
income-tax year 1931-32 was earned
in Queensland between February and
June, 1932. 1 sent in a return accord-
ingly. From the Queensland depart-
ment came two letters asking me if
the whole of my income had been dis-
closed. These I answered ; the assessment
came and I paid.
Some months later I received an
amended assessment claiming a 300 per
cent, increase on the assumption that my
rate of salary for the four and a half
months actually worked was maintained
for the 12 months. I wrote pointing out
the error and returning the amended
assessment. This the department kept
until it was overdue ; then it sent a letter
to the effect that the amended assessment
was correct and that I was now liable to
a fine for late payment. In spite of my
protests a final notice with a threat of
court proceedings followed. Rather than
undertake a lawsuit in another State I
paid up.—P. Z. X. (N.S.W.).
Committees of Unemployed
Always after any unemployed agita-
tion the Government blames Communistic
influence, and to some extent the Gov-
ernment is right. A Communist invari-
ably leads attempts the unemployed make
for their betterment, because in the cir-
cumstances a Communist is the only one
available who will lead. But don’t think
the unemployed as a body are becoming
more amenable to Communistic doc-
trines. After living for years under
dole conditions men’s nerves get frayed
to a frazzle. The smallest grievance
becomes magnified. That helps to ex-
plain seemingly ridiculous demonstrations
in Sydney and Melbourne.
The army of workless men and women
are without public representation or
organisation. If that state of affairs per-
sists and it is left to Communists to
organise and lead movements aimed at
reasonable improvements in general con-
ditions, their party must gain adherents.
At present they will lead any agitation,
multiply the original grievance beyond
recognition, drag in all manner of ex-
traneous matter and gain undeserved
advertisement and notoriety out of quite
trivial material —for instance, the recent
strike in Sydney because the men were
not allowed time off for morning tea.
Governments would be well advised to
invite the formation of committees on
every relief job and at every dole depot.
They could debar Communists from such
committees, and debar them with the
approval of the bulk of the unemployed.
The out-of-works have grievances, some
of them very real; yet leadership from
the ranks is lacking because of the fear of
being struck off the list of relief workers,
The innovation I suggest would give the
thinking give-and-take men a chance to
put Communist agitators where they
belong. The Communist is not represen-
tative of the out-of-works ; yet represent
them he will till the Government removes
from the genuine unemployed the con-
viction that any move for reasonable re-
dress that they might inaugurate would
make them the target for reprisals.—■

Young Turks and Old Fossils
The writer of the P F article <i Youn fr
T u rks” Tb* 2*l /3 / 34) was probably right
““ j 4 “4
perpetrator of the article [in Farrago ]
will be an Argus leader-writer some
day, and that possibly even the editor
ol the ‘Argus’ was a bit of a Young
Turk in his time.” But surely this is
not a fact on which Australians have any
reason to congratulate themselves. The
supply of conformists in any society is
never in danger of falling short of the
demand, so that part of the business can
be left to look after itself. But the crop
of nonconformists is usually so inade-
quate that society suffers permanently
from malnutrition of the critical faculty,
And this is not due to the absence of
right knowledge, but of any ability to
relate that knowledge to actual problems,
Melbourne has no cause to be pleased
with its university over the “Farrag®”
business. The leader which caused such
dreadful shudders was not even read by
most of the people who condemn it.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
LAMB-FATTENING.
“Tangamangaloo”: Are there any of
our lamb-fatteners who know the average
milk yield of their ewes? It is a vari-
able quantity in Australian flocks. I
have milked a ewe in full milk for as
little as a quart a day, but some of them
will give two quarts, and a few will run
to three; they are the ones that mother
the big, robust lambs. Ewe’s milk is as
high in fat as Jersey milk, but it is not
the high fat-content that counts in lamb-
raising so much as the large flow.
Many experiments have been carried
out to find the relative economy of gains
by lambs and pigs, and the lambs are not
by any means the least profitable. Lambs
will put on about lib. weight for each
61b. of milk they get from their dams.
The average gain per day will be about a
third of a pound, so that a ewe giving
61b. of milk (a little over two quarts) can
easily fatten two lambs and do the job
well. If the lambs have access to a
creek in which they can get a bit of
concentrate, they will fatten like aldermen
who have the run of the Mayor’s pantry.
A mixture of five parts cornmeal and
one part linseed meal is a wonder-
worker. After the lambs are five or six
weeks old there is no advantage in mill-
ing the corn. It can be fed as shelled.
IS IT A REMEDY?
“ ‘A’ Zone”: The scheme recom-
mended by the Graziers’ Conference to
check shed-selling is likely to have the
opposite effect.
To increase allotments by 60 per cent.,
with an extra spread of a month for the
favored “B” zone, aggravates the injus-
tice done growers in the early-shearing
“A” zone. The argument that increasing
daily offerings from 11,000 to 13,500
bales will leave “A”-zone growers as
they are now is based on the supposi-
tion that the market can absorb the addi-
tional supply.
Many shrewd men doubt this, and hold
that overloading the market may lead
to a serious setback. In these days of
finicky finance this kind of experi-
mentation is best left alone.
Faced with the prospect of delayed
realisations, many “A”-zone growers may
be tempted to anticipate the market and
sell their wool on the place.
Shed-selling might be cured if Sydney
brokers would recognise the claims of
country selling centres, such as New-
castle, Goulburn, Tamworth and Orange.
BREEDING MAIDEN EWES.
“Tipster”: The poor result of maiden-
ewe lambings is often the fault of im-
proper joining. Maiden ewes should be
joined separately—never in company
with older ewes. If the older ewes are
present the rams treat the young ’uns as
wallflowers.
Maiden ewes are a shade nervous.
They want to catch-me.
The old ewes have lost that nonsense.
Again, on account of that same ner-
vousness, maiden ewes should never be
lambed separately. They should be
mixed among older ewes to keep them
steady. Any young mother —and particu-
larly a first mother —is frightened of any
shadow which moves when she has her
first progeny at foot. If one novice
mother starts running from some fancied
fear it will disturb others, till, in next
to no time, the whole paddock is racing,
losing lambs and playing the deuce gen-
erally. A few old ewes may save many
lambs.
DRENCHING FOR WORMS.
“Liss”: “Jumbuck” (B. 21/3/’34) says
that there is little or no danger in using
an arsenic drench for lung worms. He
is quite right, and it is just as safe for
the worms as for the sheep. No drugs
incorporated in drenches administered
orally are excreted by the lungs in suffi-
cient strength to have any effect on
either of the lung worms, Strongylus
filaria and S. rufescens. Lung worms are
exceedingly difficult to treat, and, apart
from inhalations, which are not practic-
able in the case of large numbers, the
only effective treatment is the administra-
tion of intra-tracheal injections, given
with a hypodermic syringe equipped with
a stout needle. The needle is inserted in
the windpipe, about half-way along, be-
tween the tracheal rings, the dose being
injected slowly. Of course a general
worm drench should be a part of the
treatment, as, for the sake of the sheep’s
general health, it must be cleaned of
other worms. An excellent formula for
intra-tracheal injection is:
lodine 30 grains
Benzine 10 fl. oz.
The benzene is obtained from coal-tar
naphtha, and must not be confused with
benzine obtained from petroleum oil.
The dose is from 2 c.c. for lambs up to
4 c.c. for adult sheep.
In the same issue “Egad” speaks of
drenching whether you think that your
sheep need it or not. This is not neces-
sary. If sheep are not wormy, the drench
can do no good, and, in fact, may do
harm. To ascertain if sheep are infested
or not, it is only necessary to gather
some fresh droppings from the mob
under suspicion and place them in a
screw-top glass jar. Screw the lid down
tightly and place away in a dark corner
for three or four days. By this time any
worm eggs present will have hatched, and
the lame will have left slimy tracks in
the dewy moisture on the side of the jar.
DRESSED WEIGHT.
“Duke of Derrimut”: The Hereford
steer that won the pure-bred steer class
at the Sydney Royal dressed 64 per cent.
It is a good percentage. Without doubt,
the stud breeders have evolved a beast
that gives a high percentage of beef when
well fed. The averages of the well-bred
cattle are dragged down, however, by the
large numbers of ill-finished scrubs and
dairy sorts that go through the works.
I think our Australian average is not
more than 50 per cent. The usual run of
steers killed by the Chicago packers
dresses about 53 per cent., good to choice
steers ranging from 56 to 59 per cent.,
and steers of extra good show type going
from 60 to 63 per cent. I once saw a steer
dress at 67 per cent. The world’s record
is, I think, a speyed heifer killed at the
Smithfield Fat Stock Show in London that
dressed 76.75 per cent. She must have
been a beauty. Fat cows dress about 55
per cent, and canners around 40 per cent.
I am inclined to think that “finish”
is almost as important as breeding in get-
ting a high percentage of dressed beef.
When the stock are “nice and fat with
grass and lots of rain,” as Saltbush Bill
put it, even those of inferior breeding will
give a good percentage of dressed beef.
IS THIS A RECORD?
“W.D.Mc”: I nominate Lily, owned
by D. Cairns, of Rosebud (Vic.),
as Australia’s champion long-distance
milker. She has been stripped regularly
for 19 years —13,870 times. I once saw
a speyed cow on Oura station (N.S.W.)
that provided milk and cream for a
family of eight persons for seven years,
and 1 owned another that produced a
useful flow for three years, but after
Lily I would be ashamed to mention
them again. Judging by her photo, she is
more like a working bullock than a
record milk-producer. She has the look
of the old, solid Colling Van Diemen’s
Land bred tribes which came from
Remus (2524), the first pedigreed Short-
horn bull known to have come to Aus-
tralia. They were of the Favorite (252)
—lsabella blood, one of the richest milk-
ing families the early English Shorthorn
has known.
GRASSHOPPER MENACE.
“Valerin”: ’Hoppers have denuded
large areas of N.S.W. pastoral land of
winter feed and eaten out early-sown
crops. With a mild spring, there is
grave danger of swarms hatching out
and devastating the wheat areas.
Up to a point methods of control re-
commended by the Department of Agri-
culture are satisfactory enough, but long
experience of similar treatment in S.
Africa and the Argentine doesn’t inspire
confidence.
The difficulty with these remedies is
the mobility of the ’hoppers. As soon
as they are on the wing they travel
rapidly. Concerted action over vast and
sparsely settled areas is virtually impos-
sible. Bush country is hard to deal
with. The Lands Department shows
a passive attitude towards pest-destruc-
tion on Crown areas. The natural fear
of poisoning stock and the high costs
of treatment also are influences.
In the closely settled areas treatment
should be made compulsory, and the
work of extermination should be started
as soon as the ’hoppers emerge from the
ground and before they take to the wing.
Apart from poison and sprays, excellent
results have been obtained by tying to a
long pole a bag saturated with kero-
sene, lighted and dragged over the bed
of young ’hoppers in the warm parts of
the day when they cluster most closely
together.
The possibilities of parasite attack
should be investigated. More than 30 years
ago an invasion of ’hoppers in the Hunter
River (N.S.W.) districts was checked by a
parasite which destroyed them in
myriads. In the Argentine successful ex-
periments were carried out with parasites,
and reports should be available.
We cannot afford to ignore what may
become a menace to primary producers.
DISTEMPER CURES.
“Liss”: Re these distemper cures (B.
28/3/’34).
First of all, let us understand what the
disease is. It is a catarrhal fever, affect-
ing the membranes of the head, air pas-
sages and alimentary tract, and very fre-
quently the nervous system becomes in-
volved. This is almost invariably the case
in acute attacks, and the results are to
be seen in the nervous twitchings which
are so often a legacy of the disease. It
is most contagious. There is no sure
cure, but a great deal can be done both
to prevent it and to assist a stricken dog
to health again. It is not, as many sup-
pose, a necessary malady, and, if proper
kennel hygiene is practised and the pup-
pies are kept free from internal para-
sites, may be avoided. The treatment
mainly consists in sympathetic nursing
and proper care, nature doing the rest.
First of all, administer an emetic con-
sisting of a teaspoonful of salt and a
similar amount of mustard in a little
warm water. Keep the dog on a light
diet of milk and soup, and keep the
bowels open with castor oil. Wash the
discharge from the eyes and nose with
warm water and disinfectant, and, above
all things, keep the dog warm and com-
fortable. Should a cough develop, use
a tonic made up of one teaspoonful of
port wine and one grain of quinine sul-
phate. The dose for large dogs is a
dessertspoonful in the same quantity of
linseed tea, and smaller dogs in propor-
tion.
CANNIBAL SOWS.
“Poddy”: “Jerry” (B. 28/3/’34) is
guilty of libel when he blames the sow
for eating its young, and the butcher is
not the cure. It is simply a case of mal-
nutrition or deficiency disease caused by
improper feeding and insufficient pro-
tein content in the food consumed. A
pig is omnivorous, and requires a very
varied diet. It should be given a meaty
meal at least twice a week. You can’t
beat a rabbit stew mixed with pollard or
ground barley. If stews are not obtain-
able, use a bone- or meat-meal mixed in
with the feed. A sow properly fed and
kept in good condition will never eat
her young. Pigs should always have
access to charcoal and wood ashes,
especially if kept in sties.
PRESERVING TIMBER.
“Tree Destruction”: Forbes (N.S.W.)
Graziers’ Association has decided to
father a move to prevent the indiscrimi-
nate destruction of green timber. A great
deal of useless destruction is going on
unchecked and, as trees are useful not
only for shade but to prevent soil ero-
sion, it should be stopped.
In other parts there are miles
of standing ringbarked trees. In addi-
tion to being unsightly, they show a lack
of understanding by those who leave
them there. Certainly dead trees do not
draw sustenance from the soil and grass
grows better, but there isn’t much pas-
turage in fields crowded with dead and
fallen timber. They don’t ringbark in
M.L. or in the U.S.A. On ground there
to be cleared the trees are cut down
while green and burned or hauled. This
procedure is much easier than cutting dry
trees.
Anyhow, systematic dynamiting is
better and cheaper than ringbarking and
cutting.
SKIM- AND BUTTERMILK.
“R.S.M.”: Adjoining many butter fac-
tories are piggeries where the sole feed
is the buttermilk drawn by pipe-line from
the vats. As a sole feed it is good but
wasteful. It is rich in protein like skim-
milk, and should be fed with maize or
the grain of sorghum to get the most
profit out of it. Both skim-milk and but-
termilk should be fed in much smaller
volume than is the general practice.
When they are in sties, pigs, just after
weaning, should have about 51b. skim- or
buttermilk to each pound of corn. To
give them more is wasteful. The pig just
passes the excess protein through its sys-
tem. As the pig grows the proportion of
milk to corn lessens: Pigs weighing 501b.
to 1001b., 3ib. milk to lib. corn; pigs
weighing 1001b. to 1501b., 2|lb. milk to
lib. corn ; pigs weighing 1501b. to 2001b.,
21b. milk to 11b. corn.
We have enough skim- and buttermilk
to double our output of pigs. What we
lack is the corn and the enterprise.
A combine drill will displace three or
four horses and one man where it is the
practice to use the cultivator and drill
method. To make a combine drop the
disc gear off the drill, bore the frame
with a chain-drill and fit the cultivator
frame to it. It is better to combine drills
and cultivators of the same make if pos-
sible, but any will do at a pinch. The
drill frame will be strong enough to do
the extra work; in fact, there is one
firm which supplies the same frame for
both combines and drills.

CHRONIC BACKACHE
VIGOUR AND VITALITY SAPPED BY CONSTANT PAIN
WEAK KIDNEYS
are the real cause of your trouble!
There is an epidemic of premature “oldness.” Men and
women who should be in the prime of life, vigorous and vitally
fit, find their capacity for work and pleasure destroyed by
constant down-dragging pain.
Awful backache, sharp, agonising pains shooting through
the body, stiff, swollen joints, blood impurities, headaches, bad
nights or bladder troubles then follow.
. The kidneys lie at the root of your trouble, for if they are not filtering and
purifying the blood as it passes through the system, they are allowing impurities and
poisons, such as uric acid, to accumulate. Nerves become inflamed, muscles ache
with pain. Neglect your warning and you are heading for breakdown.
There is only one thing to do and that is to prompt the kidneys
to clear out from the body the pain-giving impurities. Keep the
kidneys active and healthy and your pain and suf-
fering will disappear. For this purpose we do most
strongly recommend a short course with De Witt’s
Kidney and Bladder Pills.
THIS FAMOUS REMEDY FOR OVER 40 YEARS

The very young, the weakest and the oldest can
take De Witt’s Pills with confidence. They contain
no dangerous drugs, but are a scientific preparation

HINTS FOR THE FARM
“Billbungra”: A better binding for
cracked axe- and shovel-handles than
“Drayman’s” (B. 14/3/’34) is a length
of wallaby- or ’roo-tail skin slipped on
green (or after soaking) with the aid of
boiled oil or soap. The tails can be
easily skinned without cutting along
their length by clipping the hair off and
soaping the hair side to let it slide easily
over itself. A coat of varnish over the
finished binding when thoroughly dry
will keep the damp out.
“Hyller”: Many farmers when killing
a sheep or beast let the insides drop on
to the ground. Put an old washing tub
under the gallows. This can be carted
away easily without any handling of the
offal, and saves all the blood, etc., for
the pigs. Besides, it makes the killing
spot far cleaner and better to work
in. A small tub for the useful parts—
liver, etc. —is another good dodge.
“M.S.J.”: If you want a couple of
stacks of rough feed try this at harvest
time: Select a paddock with good sweet
straw and bring the binder behind the
header, taking about a foot or six inches
of crop with the straw, according to how
much wheat you can risk in the horse
feed. With wheat at its present price it
pays to do this, particularly if you have
a few head of cattle that might want a
bit of feed during the winter.
“Wandi”: To get a leverage on a
tough stump that you want to pull out
with horses or bullocks, hook the chain
round the bottom —not the top—of the
stump, with the hook on the opposite
side to the team, and pass the chain over
the top of the stump. If that doesn’t
shift it, get the chain round a big root
and pass over the top as before.
“Dimon”: Where a wire fence crosses
a narrow hollow swept by floodwaters
use droppers —stout battens that stand on
the surface —on the low ground. Posts
sunk into the ground get washed out, and
with the start of the holes the hollow
soon becomes a gully. The dropper span,
besides preventing erosion, is easier to
repair if damage occurs through rubbish
collecting.
“Karaway”: With the metal caps of
bottles you can make a currycomb. Tack
them in rows on a piece of fin. pine
about 4in. square, with the crimped edges
upwards. One strong tack in the centre
of each suffices. Nail a piece of deal,
rounded at the outer end, on the back
for the handle ; or cut the whole out in
one piece, in the shape of a bat.
“Catchup”: Try this butter recipe:
Take about three parts of a churn of
fresh cream and squeeze into it half a
lemon. Let it stand overnight, and next
morning the butter will come quickly and
be very fresh. There is no fear of tainted
cream this way.
“X.Q.”: Bluestone (sulphate of copper)
can be readily dissolved in rainwater, in-
stead of using hot water, crushing and stir-
ring, etc. Suspend it in mosquito netting
in the water overnight. No further atten-
tion is needed. Any chemical soluble in
water will dissolve much more readily
and without bother if suspended, instead
of being placed in the bottom of a vessel.
This applies to many poisons and solids
constantly utilised by land men.
“J.R.D.”: Cut off the sharp corners
at the back of the forcing pens in your
sheepyards by putting three or four rails
across. Lambs and weak sheep get piled
up and smothered in these corners. If
shade trees are planted in them when
enclosed you will be doing yourself a
double service.
“Murrawong”: Excluding the area in
front of the kitchen stove, no other spot
on a sheep property is subjected to more
concentrated traffic than the drafting
race. It pays to concrete the bottom of
the race and, if possible, the adjoining
forcing pen. Besides lessening the dust
problem for the man on the gates, when
storms are about there will be no puddle
filling the scooped-out earthen race to
wet sheep that have to be shorn imme-
diately after drafting. If the ground
slopes up towards the race, so much the
better for drainage, and the sheep will
also run better. If the race has a down-
ward slope, you will save future time and
energy by redesigning the yards.
“Torquata”: To germinate kurrajong
seeds, place them in a cut-down kerosene-
tin filled with moist sawdust on the
southern side of the house under a tank-
stand, covering the tin with dry grass or
boughs. The seeds will germinate in
a fortnight, as against a month with other
treatment. When germination commences,
place the seeds in a jam-tin bored for
drainage and filled with soil. Transplant
in winter when the plant is partly
deciduous.
“C.F.W.”: To level the face of a hol-
lowed grindstone, try an old shoeing-
rasp. File from the outside, inwardly
and lightly.
“Gesto”: Never plant a banana sucker
in a hole from which a plant infected
with bunchytop has recently been dug
without first “burning out.” Fill the hole
with small sticks and dry leaves and light
them. If this precaution is not taken, the
new sucker will invariably contract the
disease.
“Rich. J.”: With horsehair fetching 2s.
per pound, now is the time to make the
horses earn a little of their keep. Many
farmers cut the tail straight across, which
is unwise, for knots and burrs still re-
main in the uncut portion. The best
method is a sharp knife used comb-like,
and run down from the top of the tail
to the tip. In this way, the knots are
cut, and the hair comes out in long,
straight lengths. Constant combing will
soon produce a considerable amount of
good-quality, untangled hair.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
Powers of a Queensland. Prickly-pear Com-
mission ranger ? Is he able to assess the
amount and the time required for clearing a
patch of prickly-pear country ? Method of
arriving at rent remissions; and on what evi-
dence a selector could be called on to show
reason why his land should not be resumed ?
906.
Land rangers employed by the Prickly-pear
Land Commission of Queensland have been
specially trained in the costs of clearing prickly-
pear and other noxious weeds, and in assessing
the cost of clearing an area they use their
general experience of costs for the clearing of
other lands similarly infested. Rents on Crown
tenures are assessable at different periods
according to the nature of the tenure. Prickly-
pear grazing selections are assessable for 14
years, while perpetual lease prickly-pear selec-
tions are assessable for 30 years. When these
assessments are being made, the selector is
entitled to have full consideration given to all
costs incurred by him in eradication of both
pear and noxious weeds. If a selector is negli-
gent in performing the conditions the prickly-
pear warden may call upon him to show cause
why his selection should not be forfeited. The
matter then is heard before the prickly-pear
warden and the selector may give evidence of
his intentions. If a selector undertakes to per-
form his conditions and promises to bring the
arrears of work up to date his holding is not
forfeited, and he is given extended time to per-
form the conditions. If, however, there is re-
peated failure by him the land is forfeited and
made available for some other selector.

Would it be possible to obtain samples of

a quarter of a pound each ? —lOBO.
The only attempt to collect and distribute
samples of the various wool types is repre-
sented by The Bulletin Wool Type Card, price
3s. 6d. post free from this office. This in-
cludes a small representative sample of the
main types of wool grown in Australia, and
ranges from Lincoln through crossbred and
comeback to fine merino, with a sample of
“doggy” wool. It is extremely difficult other-
wise to obtain authentic samples. The Bulle-
tin advises users of the Wool Type Card to
preserve these samples as standards and to
obtain bulkier samples to match them from
outside sources (shearing-sheds or wool-stores)
for handling purposes.

BUSINESS, ROBBERY, Etc.
Newnes
The investigation committee has sug-
gested Newnes as the location of a plant
capable of producing 6,000,000 gallons
of petrol and 16,000 tons of fuel oil
annually from local oil-shales. A co.
with capital of £600,000 is mentioned,
half of it to be put up by the
Commonwealth and N.S.W. Govern-
ments in ord. shares, and the remainder
by the public in prefs. It is suggested
that marketing should be done through
the C.O.R.
A 1927 estimate of the crude-oil values
of the Capertee-Wolgan shale deposits
was 2,000,000,000 gallons. In actual
practice these crudes produced 20 p.c.
fuel oil, 25 p.c. gas oil, 20 p.c. kerosene,
5 p.c. benzine and spirits and 5 p.c. wax.
The loss in treatment was 25 p.c.
It is not unlikely that improved
methods would produce a greater per-
centage of petrol and gas oils—in fact,
one of the handicaps of the ill-fated
Commonwealth Oil Corp.’s plant was
that it was designed principally for the
extraction of kerosene and paraffin wax.
The proposed site was selected because
of the existing plant and railway line,
which runs 30 miles down the cliffs of
the Wolgan Valley from Newnes Junc-
tion. It perhaps isn’t the most economical
site—--the Capertee side of the deposit is
considered to be the cheapest mining—
but capital outlay would be greatly in-
creased if a complete new plant and rail-
way had to be put down.
The recommendations provide for the
total remission of excise during the first
three years of production; thereafter
excise to be adjusted so as to allow 6
p.c. to shareholders and 1 p.c. for re-
serves. Income of £350,000 p.a. is based
on petrol f.o.r. Sydney fetch-
ing lHd. a gallon, and fuel oil £2 13s.
6d. a ton. Total working costs, includ-
ing depreciation and taxation, are figured
at £268,900.
Future of Property
Land periodically becomes the scape-
goat of the boomster and afterwards the
burden of the investor. Property pur-
chases at boom prices have contributed
to the difficulties of concerns like Sar-
gents, most of the picture shows, and a
large number of Sydney and Melbourne
retail houses. Craig Williamson for-
feited its equity in a freehold in Eliza-
beth-street (Melb.) rather than pay the
half-million owing on the boom-time
purchase.
All these concerns must have premises.
With large retailers it is important that
they anchor their goodwill by buying
the freehold. Yet property values are
rarely very stable, despite the fact that
land is an essential to industry. The
value of position is hard to determine
in city properties—in fact, the value
changes year by year—while under-
production or overproduction of certain
crops frequently governs the price of
agricultural lands. Queensland sugar
properties, for instance ; they have fluc-
tuated in price considerably over the last
dozen years.
Very low real estate prices are a bad
sign not merely because they are very
low but because they indicate that indus-
try is unable to make profitable use of
real property. Very high realty prices
are not a good indicator, either; they
mean that manufacturers, etc., are paying
speculators’ prices for property that is
required to earn its keep in good times
and bad. When bad times come along
and commodity prices drop, property
exes., such as rates and interest, usually
remain fixed.
One leading Sydney firm of property
auctioneers has shown a tenfold in-
crease in its business during the first
three months of this year, as compared
with last. It is heartening to those
who saw their values topple during
Lang’s crazy legislative programme, and
who have hung on. But the return of
boom-time prices, or anything like them,
would at present be as unjustifiable as it
would be undesirable. A brisk turnover
at reasonable figures, and signs that the
buyers were making profitable use of the
land—not merely passing it round—
would be sounder evidence of recovery.
To those concerns which anticipate
expansion of their business later on the
present is a good time to buy. It also
represents an opportunity for the home
purchaser. Compared with present share
prices—which seem quite high enough in
some cases —land is still comparatively
low. In Melbourne advantage of this
state of affairs has been taken by
builders, and the year to March 31 last
showed the building index at 47.5, as
against 29.6 and 17.4 in the two preced-
ing years. Even in N. S. Wales there are
good signs of recovery in the trade, and
financial houses are again turning—
cautiously— to mortgage investments.
C. H. Crammond, Richardson and
Wrench’s managing-director, spoke of the
changes in Sydney property values during
a moratorium case in the Supreme Court
last week. Four properties in Oxford-
street were valued by him in February
last at £20,850. According to the affi-
davit of a mortgagee, their value in 1928
was £43,000, and they were mortgaged
for £26,000. The withdrawal of the
’buses, said Mr. Crammond, and the
operations of chain stores near Mark
Foy’s corner had affected the small
shopkeeper in other parts of Oxford-
street, and had “ruined the street.”
Properties alongside retailers who adver-
tised extensively were enhanced as shop
sites. Values and rentals were on a
revised basis compared with 1929, wit-
ness said, but turnover had definitely
brightened.

Wool prices strengthened in the face
of a price-war amongst rayon manu-
facturers. During the past five years
the annual artificial silk production
has grown by over 200,000,0001 b., most
of the expansion taking place last term,
when, though 27 p.c. greater than in the
previous term, the output (661,000,0001 b.)
was little higher than the demand. Rayon
prices at present are about 45 p.c. of
the 1926-28 average, as against 80 p.c.
for wool. English manufacturers are
handicapped by a 50 p.c. excise tax on the
fibre ; the removal of this would make
rayon even more competitive with wool
in the U.K. Courtaulds, the shining
example quoted by forestry-bond con-
cerns when elaborating on the prospec-
tive profits of wool-pulping ventures, paid
only 6 p.c. to its ord. shareholders last
term. Many of the co.’s weaker competi-
tors are not showing profits at all.
Danish farmers, our chief competitors
in the London butter market, collectively
showed a loss of one-half per cent, on
their capital in 1932 ; in 1933 there was
a profit of 2.8 p.c. Agriculture is the
chief occupation of the Dane, and during
the good times money was lent freely,
mostly at rates round 4£ p.c.; this en-
abled the ambitious young farmer to
equip his property with modern machin-
ery, even though he had little capital of
his own. Many such farms are now
recognised to be mortgaged “far above
the chimney-pots,” and there is great
discontent and danger of a collapse. The
Socialist Government tried to help by
imposing a duty on imported grain, the
revenue to be distributed amongst the
farmers, while the price of local grain
was raised. As a result, the Danish pig-
farmer prefers to buy imported grain:
he gets some rebate from the duty, and
the local product has become almost un-
saleable. A widely-organised scheme to
grant cheap money has spread over the
country; but the average borrower has
to wait nearly Isi years before he wins
a draw! An expert committee is going
into the whole subject of the farmers’
troubles with a view to legislating.

C. J. de Garis’s widow, examined be-
fore the Melbourne Bankruptcy Court
last week, has had her liabilities esti-
mated at £255,908, nearly all incurred
in her name during the operations of
Melbourne Subdivisions, which had been
carried on by her husband. This was
De Garis’s last big spec. ; it was put
under way after the failure of the Ken-
denup (W.A.) scheme. The Melbourne
Subdivisions Co. started off about 1922,
De Garis being nominally the proprietor.
It was not until 1925, after many proper-
ties had been bought and much money
had been borrowed, that the concern’s
real financial position became evident.
De Garis committed suicide in August,
1926.

At the end of February there were five
more Middlesbrough furnaces in blast
compared with a month earlier, making 90
altogether in Britain. The iron and steel
trade has picked up wonderfully over the
last 12 months. The January output of
pig-iron was 441,300 tons, compared with
a monthly average of 343,600 tons in
1933 and 297,800 tons in 1932. Steel
ingots and castings are correspondingly
higher. Middlesbrough finds it hard to
compete with Continental mills, but the
local market has expanded.

South Aus. has been experimenting
in cheap railless transport for the
outback with a 15-ton unit consist-
ing of a tractor and two trailers.
The Overseas Mechanical Transport
Directing Committee sponsored the
trial. Diesel oil is used, and the
unit has a wide wheel track of 6ft. 4in.
An average speed of 20 m.p.h. on un-
made roads was demonstrated, but when
sandhills were encountered between Coo-
mandook and Coonalpyn the unit fared
badly. The real test will come later,
when a trip to Alice Springs and New-
castle Waters is undertaken.

“Spare Watt”: Still another claim to
have perfected a practicable steam engine
for aeroplanes has been made. Some
time ago stories appeared of successful
flights under steam-power in California ;
then there was silence. The latest
claimant is German Huettner, a well-
known engineer. He says his machine
can fly at 250 m.p.h. from 60 to 70 hours
non-stop, and that he has solved the
weight-to-power problem. Weight of
water to supply the steam is the crux. A
successful steam aero-engine, wiping out
as it would all fear of petrol shortage
and reducing costs, would revolutionise
aviation.

From C. T. Roughley, B.Sc.: “Kariah”
(B 18/4/’34) takes my modesty to task
when I state that oysters will live for ten
days out of water in summer and three
weeks in winter. That I find is a fair
average. Of course, they.will keep for
longer periods than this at times, or if
special precautions are taken to prolong
their life, such as keeping them damp
in a particularly cool spot. But why run
the risk of some of them dying, for
dead oysters are not nearly so nice as
live ones? Who wants to keep oysters,
anyway? Some people can keep beer in
their homes for months on end, but I
find in my home it will never last over-
night.

The reduction of ss. (to 15s. per h.p.)
in the British motor “horse-power tax”
should encourage the building of higher-
powered British cars. The method of
taxing on horse-power has in the past
made manufacturers concentrate on
“baby” cars, and the export trade in
large models has suffered. Australia uses
a big number of highly-powered cars.

“Si Anu”: A striking testimony to the
Japanese commercial invasion is the
latest figures of Malaya’s import business.
Last year Japan sent over 46,000,000
yards of cotton goods into Singapore—
-84.9 p.c. of the total. Britain’s share was
8.5 p.c., where it used to be the lion’s.
Proposals to restrict have found the
Government stone deaf, because wages
and salaries have fallen so low owing to
the collapse of tin and rubber that the
Japanese avalanche is being regarded in
the bazaars as a windfall. Consequently,
most of the hoariest English firms, with
histories dating back to the days of John
Company, have become indentors of
Japanese goods. Worse is still to come,
for Russia last year made a startling
appearance on the scene and grabbed 5
p.c. of the cotton-goods trade with her
cheap socialised production.

Qantas Empire Airways has secured
the contract for the Singapore-Brisbane

mail service. The cost to the Common-
wealth for the five years in the oversea

December or January next, and is to take
not more than 14 days to Brisbane and
Sydney. It is hoped to beat this limit

France is making strong efforts to
stop Australia from labelling her
wines under generic names. The ques-
tion will be raised at the conference
of the International Union for Protection
of Industrial Property, which opens in
London on May 1. French representa-
tives are alleged to be working in nine-
teen different countries in order to win
votes against Australia.

T. Dewhurst, president of the Institute
of Petroleum Technologists (London),
recently quoted figures indicating that
the world’s proved petroleum resources
amounted to 24,465,000,000 barrels, the
U.S.A. accounting for 12,000,000,000
barrels. At present rate of extraction
these reserves have a life of years.
Taking estimated unproved resources into
account, the world will be looking for
something other than gusher-oil in 1977,
if the present rate of consumption re-
mains unchanged. Oil production since
1919 —this is the only figure in Dew-
hurst’s calculations which is not purely
an estimate—has been 16,000,000,000
barrels. Bores are now tapping deeper
wells. An estimate of the oil content
of shales in the U.S. has been put at
92,000,000,000 barrels.

NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
One More “Hansard”
“Kaloa”: The Legislative Council of
the Mandate is treating itself with all the
expensive seriousness of a full-grown
Parliament. It consists of 17 members,
including the Administrator, who is the
President. Ten of them are heads of
departments; seven represent commer-
cial and planting interests. On official
questions, therefore, there can be no
salient difference —the officials will stick
together as a permanent Government
party, and the commercial community
takes the leavings, so that it does not
matter what anybody says in debate.
This has not prevented the non-elected
potentates, however, from adding to an
ornately furnished chamber the luxury of
a “Hansard” which looks as if it were
designed to record the wisdom of the
House of Commons. The session Feb.
5 to 13 produced over 60,000 words of
the usual formal nonsense, of which this
is a slab:
Mr. Hogan: I move that the Bill do now
pass and be an Ordinance entitled An Ordi-
nance Relating to Dogs.
Mr. Holmes: I second the motion.
Motion carried.
The Clerk presented the Bill to his Honor
the Administrator for his assent thereto.
Bill assented to.
The Administrator: The Council will now
adjourn for 10 minutes.
The Administrator: The Council now
resumes.
And so on ad lib. What a waste of
time the creation of the whole show has
been is illustrated by this passage:
Mr. Grose: Members desire to know
whether it is worth while submitting amend-
ments to 8i115.... Up to the present any
motion submitted by a non-official member
has been defeated by the block vote of
official members.
Mr. Marr should send a radio to
Rabaul and tell the Government that
there is a depression on. Or, better still,
it should strangle the farcical Council
before it grows up and substitute in its
place a body elected from commercial
and mining interests, with the civil service
represented, though not by a majority.
Incidentally, the Mandate appears to
possess the most picturesquely named
Government Printer south of the Line:
lan Hoogerwerff.
Ministerial Knowledge
“Montijinnie,” from one of Australia’s
largest and most remote stations:
Weird and wonderful were some of the re-
marks about the Northern Territory made in
the House of Reps, on Nov. 29 last by the
Hon. C. L. A. Abbott, M.H.R., formerly
Minister for the Territories up to 1929.
He says: “Brunette Downs comprises an
area of between 8000 and 10,000 square miles.’’
Brunette covers approximately half that square
mileage.
He proceeds: “North of Brunette is the larg-
est station in the world, Victoria River Downs.”
Mr. Abbott’s geography badly needs brushing
up. The fact is that the overland telegraph
line runs roughly north and south. The Brunette
boundary is 100 miles east, while the eastern
boundary of Victoria Downs is roughly 100
miles west of the line. Mr. Abbott must have
become very hazy as to direction when he
made his trip through the Territory by air.
He said: “Victoria River Downs has an area
of 14,000 square miles.” Actually it has only
11,000-odd. We also have this: “Some stations
are obliged to move as many as 40,000 beasts
a year.” No station does. The statement is
utterly absurd.
Finally: “Before a Minister controlling the
Territory has had time to become acquainted
with its problems he has been displaced from
office, and thus his knowledge and experience
have been lost to Australia.” I don’t question
this, for it is obvious that here at least is
one Minister who lacks knowledge.
They should start a geography class for poli-
ticians in Canberra.
Italy in Queensland
“Carbonari”: What the southern press
likes to call the “Italian menace” in
North Queensland received an effective
check last week, when two men, Bueti
and Parisi, were found guilty of unlaw-
fully wounding—they had waylaid a
compatriot whom they suspected of
“squealing,” and had cut off both his ears.
Another Italian was convicted of at-
tempted blackmail. The three were sen-
tenced by lustice R. J. Douglas at Innis-
fail Circuit Court to seven years’ hard
labor apiece. In passing sentence, the
Judge said a nasty state of affairs in the
Innisfail district had been disclosed by
the evidence. For some time there had
been an organisation of Italians in the
district which had been blackmailing
other Italians and resorting to outrage
to enforce its demands. So strong had
the combination become that many of
those threatened, though law-abiding
citizens in all respects, dared not give
information to the police which would
lead to the arrest and conviction of the
terrorists. It is worth noting that the
reputable Italian citizens of Queensland,
who comprise the vast majority of their
countrymen in the State, have expressed
themselves delighted with the heavy sen-
tences imposed. Most of them, how-
ever, deny that the criminals who have
been the scourge of the Italian canefield
community for some time past are a
branch of the Black Hand or Mafia
societies, so notorious in other countries.
They say that, with the extirpation of
these organisations in Italy by Mussolini
and others, scattered members who had
not made for New York or Chicago have
homed on the North Queensland sugar
fields, and there got together a gang of
ruffians in no way connected with the
Old World organisations.
The Biter Bitten
“Bramble Cay”: The recent fuss in
Queensland because some Japanese
shellers have been taking trochus from the
Barrier Reef suggests to an old British
New Guinea hand that time brings its
revenges. When the Queensland Govern-
ment of the day realised the richness of
the Barrier and the islands which carry
its northern end right up to the shores
of New Guinea, as it then was, it
passed an Act —the Coast Islands Act of
1879 —taking in not only the Barrier
proper but the scattered islands to the
north of it in Torres Strait up to the
" Gentlemen, the Kink!”
New Guinea three-mile limit. These
islands were then, as they are to-day,
purely Papuan, racially and culturally,
but, as their waters then held the richest
shell-beds in Australia, Queensland con-
veniently ignored the fact. The result
was that, when British New Guinea came
into being, William MacGregor found
that one of the only sources of revenue
the Territory could boast of in those days
had been taken from his control, with
the result that many thousands of pounds
that should have flowed into Daru and
Port Moresby from shell and beche-de-
mer licenses went into the Queensland
Treasury instead via Thursday Island.
What annoyed the old proconsul even
more was that his Papuans in the next
island were removed from his authority
and were cruelly exploited as skin
divers by the shell and beche-de-mer
luggers of those days without his
being able to move a finger to help
them. Further, when the raiding Tugeri
came from Dutch territory in their
canoes and butchered the inhabitants of
Boigu, Sabai and Dauan and other Papuan
peoples enclosed in the Queensland
boundary-line, he was helpless, as a
Colonial Office official, to cross the boun-
daries of a sovereign State and come to
their assistance. In many of his earlier
reports, MacGregor shows how he chafed
under the restriction, and the more so
since the Queensland Government never
made the slightest attempt to prevent
the Papuan divers from being exploited,
or to help the people in the islands they
had annexed from being periodically
raided and killed. Now the artificial
boundary-line is giving Queensland, in
its turn, some occasion for hard thinking,
and, considering everything, it would
seem that the trouble is not altogether
unmerited.
“Fly River”: The members of the
Archbold Expedition organised by the
American Museum of Natural History,
New York, recently arrived from Papua.
The leader, Richard Archbold, is a
mammalogist who has spent the last few
years chasing four-footed specimens in
many parts of the globe, notably Mada-
gascar. The team is completed by A. L.
Rand, a Canadian ornithologist, whose
six-foot-six figure would make most
Cornstalks feel small, and L. J. Brass, a
Queensland botanist, who previously col-
lected in the Solomons. The party will
be long remembered in Papua for its
ascent of Mount Albert Edward. Its
painstaking work has added to the know-
ledge of Papuan fauna and flora.
* * * *
“Titre”: R. A. Townsend, chairman
of the Export Sugar Committee, glad-
dened the hearts of Queensland producers
last week by announcing the rebates on
sugar content of exported commodities.
The general rebate is £lB 6s. per ton on
sugar used in fruit products and £2O 10s.
a ton on sugar used in other goods.
Maoriland gets the benefit of rebates for
the first time, which means an extension
of the export market, the concessions fol-
lowing on the recent trade agreement
with the All Blacks. Rebate on sugar in
fruit in this case will be £5 9s. a ton, and
for jam and other products £5 3s.
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
If you would retain your popularity, don’t
mention miniatures to the very best Brisbane
families. Recently a youngish Englishman
of prepossessing manners, and with the public-
school hall-mark, arrived bearing with
him unimpeachable letters of introduction. He
was a painter of little portraits, and had
done the faces of many well-known Sydney
and Newcastle citizens. Also, he had painted
his way through M.L. Many people seized the
opportunity to add a gem to the family por-
trait gallery, paying fairly stiff' prices for the
honor. Now the cherished “miniatures” have
been discovered to be nothing but photographs,
tinted in a mixture of crayons and water-colors.
Two females motoring along a Brisbane high-
way the other day suddenly crashed, and
found themselves breathlessly seated on a pave-
ment, with their car snorting over the front
fence of a total stranger. The youth who had
rocketed out of a side street and done the
damage excitedly urged them to “get, before
the police come.” The breathless ones refuted
the suggestion, and added a pressing invitation
to the youth to remain also and confer with
the men in blue. However, he departed, still
in a hurry, was chased by a friendly passing
motorist, and returned, under compulsion, to
the scene of smash. His haste then was ex-
plained. He had just stolen the car from a
near-by garage.
Lights of the law gathered round a large
dining-table at Lennon’s Hotel the other night to
bid bon voyage to Senior Puisne Judge Hugh
Macrossan, who is off to the East on a health
tour. Daughter Claire is going, too.
P. J. O’Shea, legal, sporting and social figure,
has donated £2OOO for the benefit of Catholic
educational and charitable works. The money
was a legacy left him by an old friend, John
Aloysius Hayes, and £lOOO has been handed
over to found the John A. Hayes bursary at
Nudgee College. The remainder of the legacy
is to be distributed among Catholic charities.
The O'Shea family is never happier than when
it is doing somebody a good turn. Pat was
well on the way to America before the news of
the legacy, and the way in which he intended
to use it got about.
Brisbane has been having a Wool Week, and
if the average citizen doesn’t instantly go forth
and lay in a store of woollies for the winter
then publicity is a fraud and advertising no
more effective than a dumb man with a mega-
phone. Sir Leslie and Lady Wilson and daugh-
ter Marjorie were ushered into a transformed
City Hall, with a band of kilties piping before
them and a body of dear old gentlemen behind
them. the D.O.Gs. mostly wore very white,
ve . f y woolly whiskers, but had nothing to do
with the sheep whose photographs adorned
various bales. Musical shows and mannequin
parades have been held every afternoon, and
pretty girls in fascinating woollen suits have
paraded daily. In the body of the hall ladies
armed with spinning-wheels have whirred away
to the fascination of the audience, while Mrs.
Reydon, a handsome, dark-eyed lady who looks
J llOl " 6 Sp ar >i s h than Danish, demonstrated the
art of hand-weaving in a space garnished with
articles of her own weaving, including scarves,
handbags, cushions and rugs. It was a well-
arranged stunt.
For the visiting Chamber of Commerceites
there was the usual civic reception and various
jaunts, including one to Mt. Coot-tha. Mrs. H.
M. Russell and Mrs. H. J. Lyons and others
formed a social committee which undertook to
keep the feminine portion of the visitors happy
and contented.
There’s no safety anywhere these days. The
other night a party of musicians who had
blown and sawed and thumped away manfully
all mghi providing music for a dance were
set on and beaten by a section of the dancers
because one of the musicians who owned a car
refused to provide free transport for a number
° 'jjr U^s didn’t want to walk home. A
middle-aged man who tried to save his musical
instrument from the young hooligans had to be
treated by the ambulance.
Died last week in St. Martin’s Hospital,
Lady Beatrice Moreton, who was born and
grew up in the Maryborough district. Her
iather was that Earl of Ducie who was an
old man before the title came to him, and who
wore it only briefly before passing it on to a
son. Lady Beatrice was a nurse, and went
overseas to nurse soldiers in the late mix-up.
She was a fine and lovable woman, and many
friends will regret her untimely passing.
Mrs. Victor Crowe, of Melbourne, is off to
England with her husband, and will spend two
years in the Cold Country. Mrs. Crowe was
Hilda Cowlishaw, daughter of James Cowlishaw,
who, with brother George, so long controlled
the destinies of Bris-
bane “Telegraph.”
A phenomenal crop of
social buds is promised
for this winter. No
doubt it is because
Prince George is com-
ing. So many have sig-
nified their desire to
“come out” at the
United Service Ball that
the president has had to
close the list. Other-
wise there might not
have been enough naval
and military partners to
go round.
A cable from Mrs.
Basil Mole s w o rth,
Queensland’s leading
woman tennis player,
states that she is in
England and feeling
very fit. She has begun
practice and will take
part in the Bourne-
mouth Hard - court
Tournament, to which
hang the championships
of Great Britain.
Aboard the Nankin when it berthed at a
Brisbane wharf the other day was Minnie
Searle, who for 26 years labored in China as a
missionary. Recently she retired, and settled
down in Australia, but she wanted to see how
the vineyard in which she had toiled so faith-
fully was getting on, and took a trip back to
see. She found that the work of the mis-
sionaries was progressing, but so is Commun-
ism, and consequently the country is in a
state of what a Queensland politician once
described as “chowse.”
Casually landing at the Archerfield aerodrome
the other day S. D. Marshall, an engineer in
the employ of Guinea Airways, added a line to
the history of Australian aviation. His was
the first aeroplane to fly from N. Guinea to
Australia, and, though two have flown from
Australia to that land of heat and mystery,
both were equipped with floats, whereas Mar-
shall’s ’plane was a wheeled affair. He was
due for leave, and when his leave is up he will
fly back again.
Two debs, this year are Joanne Woolcock
and Peggy Dinham-Peren. The first is a daugh-
ter of Justice Woolcock by his second wife
(Ida Withrington that was), one of Brisbane’s
prettiest girls, and now one of our hand-
somest matrons—and Peggy is his grand-
daughter. So, although they are something
like aunt and niece, both girls are much of an
age, and hunt in couples.
April 24 saw the wedding in Colombo of
Mrs. A. D. Condor —she was the only daugh-
ter of Dr. and Mrs. Kerwin, of Brisbane—to
a young planter who bears the historic name
of Gordon Duff. Mrs. Kerwin, who was on
a world tour, gave her daughter away.
For 35 years the Brisbane Needlework Guild
has been working, providing charitable insti-
tutions and families with extra clothing and
house-linen, and for a very large slice of that
period the annual display of work has been
held at the home of Mrs. Frank Corrie on
Bowen-terrace. There are over 800 members in
the guild, and each one supplies at least two
new articles of clothing or house-linen each
year; 53.356 articles were distributed this year.
Lady Wilson and daughter Marjorie travelled
to Sydney by train, and joined the Strathaird.
There were entertainments at Government
House before they left, and Marjorie had a
big partv of the younger set to lunch one day.
Lady Wilson is in poor health, and it is hoped
the trio will benefit her before she has to
undertake the social whirl of the Prince’s visit.
Those who know her best say that her uncom-
plaining fight against oain and illness is heroic.
News from London tells old friends in
that Diana Mills, daughter of Mrs
Harrv Miffs fshe was Hilma Ohman) and a
granddaughter of T. M King—is i
her London season. Ann Paget (Ann
Blundell that was), a half-sister of Mrs. Mills
is settled dowh in England not too far from
London, and Diana and she are doing the
social round together.

W.hat is jiu-jitsu ? Is an expert in this art
able to overcome a wrestler employing the
European holds ? —1123.
Jiu-jitsu, is the Japanese “manly art of self-
defence” without weapons. It differs from
wrestling in that it depends to a lesser degree
upon muscular strength. Its object is to clutch
or strike a part of an enemy’s body so as to
make him numb. The art was originally prac-
tised only by the nobility and kept a class
secret. Now "it is taught in all the schools and
to both sexes. The most efficacious jiu-jitsu
tricks are fouls in wrestling under European
and American rules.
(1) How did military tanks originate and
why were they so called ? (2) Any particulars
about earliest models? (3) When were they
first used in the Great War, and by whom ?
1193.
(1) They were evolved to cope with various
aspects of trench warfare, especially to deal
with enemy machine-guns which had survived
artillery attack. They were designated “tanks”
to conceal their true nature during a period of
secret construction, and the name stuck. Early
tank units were branches of the Machine-gun
Corps (heavy section) until after Battle of
Arras (1917), when they were officially recog-
nised as the Tank Corps. (2) Mark 1 tanks
were of two types, male and female; male
armed with two six-pounder Q.F. guns, female
with four Vickers machine-guns, in sponsons
on sides. Weight of tank 28 tons, speed 4
m.p.h., crew of eight men. Early models were
steered by pair of steel wheels pressed firmly
to ground at rear by strong springs, but these
were discarded owing to vulnerability, and
steering was effected by varying speed of either
caterpillar track. (3) Tanks were first used
by British on Somme, September 15, 1915, and
were seen to greatest advantage, at Cambrai
(Nov., 1917) and at Hamel (July, 1918) in co-
operation with A.I.F. They were first evolved
and used by the British Army.
What are free ports? —ll37.
A free port is a harbor where ships of all
nations may enter and load and unload free
of customs duties. They are employed as
depots where goods may be stored free of cus-
toms duty; and then the goods may be either
reshipped for export (on payment of transit
duty), or admitted for home consumption, when
the usual customs duty of the country must
be paid. Free ports have been established at
Hong Kong, Singapore, Copenhagen and New
Orleans; and the coaling stations of Gibraltar,
St. Helena and Aden are nominally free ports,
though not absolutely so.
Are there prehistoric ruins on Pacific
islands other than those on Easter Island and
the Caroline group ? Names of books on the
subject concerning the Carolines ? —970.
The highest authority on Pacific islands
archaeology is Prof. Macmillan Brown, of
Christchurch (M.L.). In a newspaper article in
1919 he described the remains of mysterious
temples on Malden Island, the great ruins of
Ponape, the strange script on Uleai (north-
west of Ponape) and detailed evidence of
“strong and highly organised government”
which he found in his analysis of Polynesian
languages. For further details see “Pacific
Islands Year Book, 1932,” especially pages 106
and 224. Except for Prof. Brown’s books there
are few dealing only with Pacific archaeology;
but there are many references to this subject
in the thousands of books dealing with the
Pacific. A list of over 40 books dealing with
the Carolines and adjacent islands was pub-
lished in the bibliography in Stewart’s “Hand-
book of the Pacific,” 1922 edition.
Does the weight of the human body increase
after eating and drinking ? If so (ignoring the
ordinary exudation of moisture through the
skin), by what amount? —1122.
Bodily weight increases in corresponding
ratio with the amount of food eaten, either
liquid or solid, but the increase is not main-
tained. The processes of metabolism, or chemi-
cal tissue change, are continuous. Apart from
moisture evaporation the combustion, or de-
structive katabolism, is constant as the sou ice
of energy and heat. Of the energy obtained
from food, practically 75 per cent, is used in
the normal body processes. In health the
equilibrium of weight is controlled by glandu-
lar and organic functions. Digesti<pn and
assimilation are factors of consequence in either
case.
What difference is there between the skeleton
of a Polynesian and a European ? Could a
complete skeleton be identified definitely as
Polynesian or European, and how ? 1042..
There is no exact method of identification.
The skull may be examined for racial charac-
teristics —cheek-bone, jaw_ and teeth usually
show over-development in native or uncul-
tured races. The splay-foot is also noted, but
as compared with the European there is little
difference in brain cavity or general bone for-
mation.
I saw a doctor last month and he suggested
a test for sugar, after looking at my tongue,
which is always beefy red, but gives no trouble
apart from my illness—persistent tiredness.
Does tongue color indicate anything in such
cases? What is the normal color? —1131.
The red, beefy tongue is most often en-
countered in diabetes and similar wasting
diseases. As a preliminary to treatment, the
test for sugar is usual. In health, the normal
color of the frontal portion of the tongue is
a pale red, the posterior or root area being
greyish, with reddish elevations or papillae in
marked contrast.
A few details concerning Meniere’s disease
and its cure? —1091. .
It is due to middle-ear tension or haemor-
rhage, which irritates and destroys the nerve
terminals in the labyrinth of the ear. True
Meniere’s lesion is a symptom-complex in
which paroxysmal attacks of giddiness, head
noises and more or less persistent deafness are
present. The term is usually restricted to those
cases where the triple symptoms are unasso-
ciated with local discharge. As the deafness
progresses and becomes complete the giddiness
tends to disappear, but the head noises in-
variably remain. Treatment must be directed
against anything that might cause increased
tension; unless otherwise indicated the patient
should abstain from tea, coffee, tobacco,
highly-seasoned foods and alcohol. Medical
supervision is required.
On which ribbon of the Victory medal and
in what position should palm leaves, large and
small, be placed ? —1054.
The emblems referred to are not palms, but
oak-leaves in bronze. They may be worn on
the ribbon of the Victory medal by persons
who have been mentioned one or more times
in dispatches. The emblem is in two sizes.
The larger, worn with the medal, should be
affixed to the centre of the ribbon at an angle
of 60 degrees from the inside edge of the
ribbon, stem to the right. The smaller, to be
worn when the medal is not worn, should be
placed traversely across the ribbon, stem to
the right.
Recently I slipped my auxiliary cutter for
overhaul, and while taking off the propeller the
brass nut crumbled away under the spanner.
Shaft is Tobin bronze and the propeller is cast
of a special metal. How can I prevent this hap-
pening again ? —1125.
Cause is galvanic action arising through the
contact of dissimilar metals. To prevent it,
fit a propeller nut of Tobin bronze.
I have a mainsail that is badly mildewed,
though it is always kept under a good water-
proof cover. Cause and cure? —1120.
The cover is probably the cause. Covers, if
they are airtight, “sweat,” and damp the sail
by condensation, and if they admit air they
admit rain to wet the sail and cause mildew.
Never stow a sail unless it is bone-dry. In
humid weather, if the sail is salt-stained, shake
it out frequently; or, if this is impossible, wash
out the salt and dry thoroughly. A preventive
process is to soak the canvas in a weak solution
of sugar of lead and alum.
(1) What gives the Thursday Island luggers
their qualities of seaworthiness ? (2) Tonnage,
sail area and height of masts of a 40 ft. craft ?
(3) What horsepower engine would be wanted
to give a fair turn of speed ? (4) How many
men would be required to handle such a craft ?
—874.
(1) Good hull design, handy rig and efficient
seamanship. (2) About 14 tons; sail area, 500
to 600 square feet; mainmast about 35ft. (at
most), mizzen 6ft. shorter. (3) 20 to 25 h.p.
(4) Three.
(1) (a) A star three degrees to the south of
Jupiter seems to have approximately the same
angular movement. Why is this ? (b) Name
of the star ? (c) Magnitude ? (2) (a) What star
performs the same function for navigation in
the Southern Hemisphere as Polaris does in
the Northern ? (b) Angular distance from
the south celestial pole ? (c) Mean time when
on meridian at April 21 ? (d) Magnitude ?
1051.
(1) (a) That Jupiter is at present keeping
apparently the same angular distance with the
star is only a coincidence. The change of the
planet’s position amongst the stars just now
is very slight, and Jupiter will remain in its
present position in the sky for the rest of the
year. ( b ) Spica (Alpha Virginis). ( c ) 1.21. (2)

Composition of “Greek fire” used in Middle
Ages, and by whom was it invented'.? —-1129.
The name was applied to various liquid
fires employed in the Middle Ages, but
specifically to a preparation invented by an
architect named Callinicus, who lived in the
reign of Constantine Pogonatus (648-685). He
is said to have fled from Heliopolis in Syria
to Constantinople, and his “wet fire was used
at Cyzicus to set fire to the Saracen sfiffi s ;
Constituents of the mixture are unknown, but
Lieut.-Col. H. W. L. Hime, after a careful study
of all available evidence, decided that it dif-
fered from the other preparations of the kind
in containing quicklime, which, when mixed
with sulphur, naphtha, etc., took fire spon-
taneously when wetted.
(1) How much honey is imported into the
United Kingdom annually ? (2) How much
does Australia supply ? (3) Is there any duty
in favor of Australia ? (4) What are the pro-
duction figures of (a) honey, (b) beeswax in
N. S. Wales for the last three years ? (5) In
Vic. ? (6) What was the value of the honey
and beeswax produced in N. S. Wales last
year? —lllB. ... T .
(1) Average 80,000 cwt. (2) 1800 cwt. (3) It
was agreed at the Ottawa Conference in 193_
that the United Kingdom should impose an
import duty of 7s. per hundredweight on foreign
honey, and the increase in the imports of
Australian honey should be shown in the 1933
figures when they are available. (4) Latest
available figures: 1929-30 (a) 2,101,6191 b., (b)
35,4931 b.; 1930-31 (a) 2,643,8711 b., (b)

honey, £37,000; beeswax, £l6OO.
When servants are engaged through a N.S.W.
registry office is the employer chargeable with
an office fee for so engaging? —93l.
The regulations under the N.S.W. Industrial
Arbitration Act provide that registered private
employment agencies may charge the employer
certain prescribed fees.
What taxation is paid on motor-cars in Eng-
land ? —991. .
The basic tax on private motor-cars in the
United Kingdom is £1 per h.p. There is also
a compulsory insurance tax which is approxi-
mately as follows: 14 h.p., £7 10s.; 16 h.p.,
£8 55.; 27 h.p., £ll 55.; and 34 h.p., £l2. The
cost of a driver’s license is ss. p.a.
Concerning the disused railway line in Mel-
bourne running from Fairfield Park to East
Camberwell and there joining the Ashburton
line: (1) What line was the Inner Circle and
why was it so called ? (2) In what year was
the line built? (3) Cost? (4) Was it used for
passenger and goods traffic, or for goods only ?
(5) For how long was it used ? —1077.
(1) There was no line known as the Inner
Circle, but the line from Oakleigh to Fair-
field Park via Ashburton was known as the
Outer Circle, because it ringed through the
outer suburban area. (2) The connecting line
between Oakleigh and Fairfield was opened
for traffic in sections—Oakleigh to Waverley-
road, 23/3/’9O; Waverley-road to Riversdale
and loop to Camberwell, 30/5/’9O; Riversdale
to Fairfield Park and loop towards Canterbury,
24/3 /’9l. (3) Total capital cost of line from
Oakleigh to Fairfield Park was £307,239. (4)
Major portion was used for both goods and
passenger traffic. (5) Line between Riversdale
and Fairfield Park was used until 12/4/’93, on
which date the train service over this portion
was discontinued. In May, 1900, the section
between Riversdale and Deepdenje was re-
opened for passenger traffic and was so used
until 1927, in which year the passenger ser-
vice was discontinued. This line is, however,
still used for goods traffic to Hast Kew. The
service between Ashburton and Oakleigh was
continued until 1897. The Riversdale-Ash-
burton section is still in use.
How can I rid a store of rats ? It is overrun
with the pests in ceiling, walls and under floor,
and baits and traps have been tried without
success. —1075.
The only measures available are traps,
poisoning, fumigation and rat-proofing. The
fumigants used are sulphur dioxide, carbon
disulphide and hydrocyanic gas (which can
only be safely employed by a professional
fumigator). Trapping and poisoning require
skill and knowledge. Traps should be placed
along runways and to avoid “man-smell”
should be handled with tongs or gloves, or
“smoked.” Barium carbonate is an effective
poison. Try spreading it on fish, toasted bread
(moistened) or ordinary bread and butter.
What was the original Kit-Cat Club to which
Sir Robert Walpole belonged? —lll3.
It was composed of Whig wits, painters, poli-
ticians and writers, and was founded in Lon-
don about 1703. Its name was derived from
that of Christopher Cat, the keeper of a pie-
house near Temple Bar, where the club first
met. Later it moved to a specially-built room
at Barn Elms. There were originally 39 and
afterwards 48 members, including Marlborough,
Steele and Addison. It was dissolved about
1720. Sir Godfrey Kneller painted portraits of
many of the members of a uniform size (36in.
by 28in.) to suit the Barn Elms room. This is
now known as the kit-cat size.
Any information about Edwin Abbey, the
Shakspearean illustrator ? —1159.
He was born in Philadelphia in 1852, and
died in Chelsea in 1911. He was elected a
Royal Academician in 1898, and was the leader
of the school of decorative painters in England.
He painted a very famous series of mural
panels for the Boston Public Library. His
Shakspearean illustrations were pen drawings of
outstanding skill and charm, made for Harper
Bros.
When was the Tang period of Chinese art ?
What distinguishes it? —1147.
From a.d. 618 to 905, considered one ot
the greatest periods of Chinese assthetic output.
During this time the greatest poetry and the
most vigorous art works were produced. In
the paintings the Buddhist ideas were pre-
eminent. Landscape painting was much in
favor and most interesting examples were pro-
duced, as well as excellent articles in carving
and pottery.
(1) Any information regarding extent of
Indian N.-W. Frontier disturbance following the
Great War ? (2) Were Australian troops in-
volved ? —llOl
(1) The third Afghan War broke out early
in 1919 when the Indian Army was demobilis-
ing The brunt of the fighting was over in four
months, and, although chiefly of a guerilla
nature, several decisive engagements involving
the use of heavy artillery (chiefly in the reduc-
tion of forts) took place. The extremely rough
and barren nature of the country favored the
tribesmen and hampered British lines of com-
munication on a front stretching from Chitral
to East Persia. Casualties were considerable,
greatest proportion being due to cholera,
malaria, and other diseases. (2) No Australian
units took part, the bulk of the forces being
native troops commanded by British officers.
But practically every unit at that time con-
tained at least one Australian officer.
Brief Answers.
J.W.: Refer to Patent and Trade Mark
Department, Commonwealth Bank Buildings,
Martin-place... .T.C.: No job for an ama-
teur. Send it to a gunsmith R-Q.‘- Pro-
bably you refer to stamp (death) duties. By
the Stamp Duties Act, 1933 (N.S.W.), estates
not exceeding £5OO in value are exempt from
duty. Between £5OO and £lOOO no duty is
chargeable on property passing to a widow or
to children under 21 years of age, and where in
such cases it does exceed that sum, but does
not exceed £5OOO, half rates are charged. The
Federal Government also imposes a death duty
up to £lOOO of £1 p.c., and exceeding that amount
of £1 p.c., together with an additional percent-
age of one-fifth of £1 for every £lOOO or part
in excess of £2OOO. In case of intestacy one-third
of the estate goes to the wife and two-thirds
between the children equally J.H.: (1) and

made J.K.: You can take whatever name
you please without legal process, but to do so
may be the cause of future inconvenience and
expense. The proper course is to change the
name by deed poll. The cost, including stamp
duty, solicitor’s fees and advertisements, should
not exceed a few guineas. With regard to a
Christian name only, it is doubtful whether
it would be worth incurring the cost, pro-
vided that in all legal and business transactions
the proper baptismal name is adhered t 0....

Wool Yarns No.
Dyed in the Wool
My lord, runs an old verse, “there is no wool so
white
That dyers can't make black.”
But the dyers at Yarra Falls—the largest Worsted,
Spinning end Weaving Mills in the Southern Hemi-
sphere—can 30 further. In piece-dyed fabrics they
have perfected 520 shades of delicate variations of
toning. In “dyed in the wool” yarns, they have
produced no less than 800 solid shades, with com-
binations giving 4400 tonings!
Yarra FALLS-A National Achievement
The work of Yarra Falls dyers is symbolic of the
' work of Yarra Falls as a whole. ... of striving,
building, improving, achieving. The excellence of
Yarra Falls dyeing—the exquisite colourings obtained,
the variety of tonings and soft gradations of shade—
is but the finishing touch applied to an excellence of
craftsmanship that' is carried through every process
in the manufacture of Yarra Falls Yarns and Woven
Fabrics to its ultimate conclusion in the finished
article. Yarra Falls is a monument of successful
endeavour. A National Achievement.
16 YEARS OF PROGRESS
Sixteen Years of Progress has been the reward
of Yarra Falls for the excellence of craftsmanship
that has found expression in its mills. Sixteen years
ago Yarra Falls started operations in a comparatively
small way with a Wool-combing Department, with
the primary objects of combing and spinning wool
into yarn. To-day, Yarra Falls represents a great
Australian Secondary Industry in the production—
not only of Worsted Yarns—but in the manufacture
of all classes of worsted fabrics.
To-day the Worsted, Spinning and Weaving Mills of
Yarra Falls use 18,000 bales of wool yearly—approxi-
mately £lO,OOO worth every week. The annual output
capacity of yarn per annum is 2,500,0001 b. weight;
that of woven fabrics 1,750,000 yards. Mill floor

Yarra Falls’ spinning machines and weaving looms
were selected by one of Yorkshire’s leading spinners,
and, under expert guidance, Australian operatives
work them. Yarra Falls now has 1300 names on its

The Palette,
In the Ladder to Fame exhibition at
the Sedon Galleries, Melbourne saw the
best that its upper half-thousand can do
in the way of wit, humor, art and imagi-
nation. The result was more mediocre
than the art at an agricultural society
exhibition. Prof. Bernard Heinze won
first prize, presumably in the wit divi-
sion, for a plain black canvas entitled
“Dawn.” Krishnamurti submitted a
house and a hill in the kindergarten
manner. The general impression con-
veyed by the 500-odd entries was that,
if the Best People had to entertain each
other instead of being able to pay
painters, musicians, playwrights and
novelists to entertain them, they would
have a dull time.
F. J. Coventry, whose drawings and
engravings adorn the walls of the Mac-
quarie Galleries (Sydney), is ■ an artist
who seems to be still searching for
congenial subjects. His pencil portraits
of men are delicately wrought, and carry
conviction. His command of line is so
sure that he can present a just record of
intricate machinery (“Port Turbines,
R.M.S. Orford”), of the grace of trees
(“Beeches, Hampstead Heath”) or the
fantastic scenery of Sydney’s flat-land
(“Carinthia”). His bid for the originality
prize is a “horizontal portrait”—beauti-
fully drawn, but the model, if the picture
is authentic, must have had a bad crick
in his neck before the sitting was over.
Even to look at the picture gives one a
pain in that locality.
In the show of Francis R. Thompson at
Melb. Athenaeum, natural color, light and
harmony are offered up as burnt sacrifices
to gods long dead. It has been said of Mr.
Thompson that he takes a joy in his pig-
ments, but that’s as poor a substitute for
joy in Nature as joy in crossword puzzles
is for joy in literature. It involves no
more than a reshuffling of old arrange-
ments and it binds the artist to formulae.
Mr. Thompson started out a few years
ago as a very promising and very indus-
trious student. He used to be a house-
painter in Mansfield (Vic.), and fought
his way to Europe and the opportunity
of surveying the Old Masters. He is in
danger of becoming a present fashion
and a future failure.
P. Stanhope Hobday’s monotypes,
shown at the Academy Salon, Sydney’s
newest gallery, are primarily interesting
because of the clever way in which the
process has been managed. It seems an
absurd thing to paint a picture in oils on
a metal plate and to make just one print
on paper from the plate. But there is a
quality to be obtained that way which
is as charming as it is elusive. Every
Sydney painter this critic has met who
has experimented in monotypry—since
Henry Fullwood there has been none
in the Greatest Bloat who could call him-
self even a craftsman in that line —says
that this Queenslander Hobday is a
master of the process. He gets, but with
more certitude, the effects which the
makers of gum-bichromate photographic
pictures strive to obtain. As a draughts-
man and painter Hobday is versatile and
resourceful. He limns rural landscapes,
marine scenes and portraits with equal
facility.
The Australian Water Color Institute’s
show in the Education Department’s
Gallery, Sydney, brings to light no
hitherto undiscovered talent. Norman
Lindsay has a couple of pieces that no-
body else could have painted. B. E.
Minns, as president of the society,
does his duty nobly with several well-
assorted sketches which, like Lind-
say’s, need no signature. Dattilo Rubbo
presents “An Old Buffer.” He loves to
portray old people, and this is a very
sympathetic study. G. K. Townshend
has six exhibits, remarkably even in
merit and all good. J. R. Elder-
shaw portrays “The Spit” (Sydney Middle
Harbor) with an outcrop of reds which
makes his drawing one of the best eye-
catchers in the exhibition. H. R. Gal-
lop, who is graduating from the para-
graphist art of the poster-draughtsman
to the three-volume-novelist mode of the
R.As. of 1840, shoots most successfully,
in eight tugs of the bow, at Tuggerah
Beach. Maud Sherwood exploits her
vogue in a study of canna lilies and in
another of green apples, neither in her
inspired mood. The best flower study in
the show is Margaret Coen’s group of
red cannas. The aboriginalists, repre-
\r^ tec * Grace Cossington Smith and
Vida Lahey, and the queer stylists—Ken-
neth Macqueen, Donald Friend and Tom
Garrett come in this category —give spice
to a show which otherwise might lack
variety. Fred Leist’s wood-block for the
programme cover deserves a special word
of praise.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Grammar is Head of the River! It
rowed to victory, under boisterous condi-
tions, to the shrill whistles of launches
and the tooting of sirens, the shouts and
shrieks and trumpetings of fathers,
mothers, aunts and uncles, sisters and girl
friends, to say nothing of young brothers.
It was a great race ; 100,000 viewed it.
Cabarita Point was thick with cars; the
foreshores, right down to the water’s
edge, were thronged with watchers. On
the water, ferry, yacht and canoe found
it heavy going; not so the flapper of
the water-craft, the speedboat; she sped
up the racing course leaving a glistening
cascade of wind-blown spray behind her.
All boats were top-heavy with girls and
boys, all barracking loudly, and all sport-
ing the colors of one or other of the
crews. Men wore bunches of ribbon in
their lapels ; girls did likewise, many add-
ing a beret or scarf to match. Vividly
striped cardboard megaphones were vim-
fully used by both sexes. Cries of
“Grammar!” “Scots!” “High!” and
“Shore!” rent the air. And when the
best crew won the cheers of Gram-
marians were taken up by all until it
seemed as though the heavens themselves
would split asunder.
No one wanted to stay at home after
such an afternoon. So every show in
the city was filled; so was every ball-
room. Grammar celebrated its victory
at the Blaxland Galleries. Hundreds of
young things turned up to this in black-
and-gold-ribboned cars, and with mega-
phone and trumpet helped to make a
noise which reached its peak on the arri-
val of crews and coaches after their
dinner on the shore of the river. The
G.P.S. Old Boys’ Union had its Re-
gatta Day dance at David Jones’s. Here,
too, the ballroom was filled mainly with
young things, the girls in ground-length
frilled organdies and with flowers in their
hair. Grammar’s chief, H. S. Dettmann,
came on to this after putting in an ap-
pearance at his own boys’ affair. There
were just as much youth and good looks
gathered in the big assembly-room of
Joeys, Hunter’s Hill, where principal
Brother Placid was host.
Margery Ward and a group of young
Royal Prince Alfred helpers ran a
Regatta Ball in the Pompadour Ballroom
at Nock and Kirby’s. This was deco-
rated with the colors of all the G.P.Ss.,
and members of the “Good Catch”
revue, with songs from this sparkling
comedy, put an extra cheer into an
already merry evening.
It’s a pity that that use-mo re-wool
enthusiast Mrs. Toby Brown wasn’t at
lima Barnes’s presentment of Masefield’s
“Tale of Troy.” The roses, red, yellow
and green, that wreathed the heads and
shoulders of the speakers were made of
wool; otherwise they were wrapped in
gold, lima herself was resplendent in
flame, and afterwards in purple with a
blue veil. All wore the wrist-length tight
sleeve, and the dresses clung so closely to
their figures that the onlooker could
hardly believe they measured eight yards
round the hem.
The first part of the programme was
given to such items as “The Tin Gee-
Gee” and “The Laird o’ Cockpen.” Lady
Game was a front-seater, and wore ivory
laces, and a high standing white-fox
collar on her black-velvet coat. Mrs.
Vernon Cole was gold under a black
embroidered coat, and sat with her lately
returned American friend Mrs. Judd,
who sported rose-patterned black chif-
fons.
The Royal Sydney Yacht Club took
on quite a political air when the wives
of the members of the State Parliament
hostessed a party in honor of the wives
of the Ministers. The sun shone down
on a harbor as darkly blue and green
as a Lightning Ridge opal; the lawns
were emerald, and the putting competi-
tion was won by Mrs. Ronald Walker.
Indoors, there were pink and mauve
asters to inspire the music -makers, and
the tea tables wore sprays of golden rod
and yellow chrysanthemums. The most
honored were the wives of Premier
Stevens and Transport Minister Bruxner.
They got baskets of flowers; the others
received posies.
St. Stephen’s bloomed with the glory
of autumn the day that Peggy Bullmore
became Mrs. George William Campbell.
Tall baskets spilled over with golden
beauty. The bride’s dress was the color
of ripening corn ; pinned on it was a
spray of green and black orchids. Her
black hat intensified the fairness of her
hair, which was curled in Grecian
fashion. There were no bridesmaids, but
sister Gretel’s cluster of gardenias and
her hyacinth-blue crepes were in the pic-
ture. Few and very intimate were the
friends that gathered later at Talinga at
the bidding of the bride’s parents.
Of learned brothers there were many
and of literary folk a liberal sprinkling
when lawyer Frank Letters read his verse
at the Arts Club. Governor Game was
one of the most interested, and he en-
joyed the violin music made by Mrs.
Frank Letters (Kathleen Logue that was),
whose white satins carried a long side
train. Mrs. Scrivener hostessed in pink
laces, assisted by Mrs. S. Letters, in
black. Mrs. Harry Twigden wore prune
panne velvet. Speaker Levy brought his
sister, who was wrapped in an ermine-
collared white coat.
Two singing girls sat together, our own
Gladys Verona, in spreading blue-pat-
terned black taffetas, and Melbourne’s
Jean Lewis, in pink chiffons. Dr. Mac-
kaness brought his wife, she in flowered
chiffons. Mrs. G. Nassoor wore the right
shade of green, and Brian McGrath, who
instigated the affair, sat by Mrs. Brian.
High Court Judge McTiernan had a word
with many, and from afar could be seen
the gleam of the Poynter lady’s long gold
lam£ gloves.
Music was served in the Assembly
Room and the cup that cheers in the
Reading Room of Manning House when
Sydney Uni. Women Grads, had their
frivol last week. Both rooms were
reached by way of wide, shallow stairs.
On the landing president Dr. Marie Ben-
tivoglio and Miss I. M. Fidler gave the
welcoming hand, while the sun shone
joyously through the large window at
the end, and dahlias glowed golden and
ruby-red in corners and on tables. Mar-
got Hentze, anthropologist, Camilla
Wedgwood, just back from research
work in New Guinea, and Miriam Eld-
ridge were among the afternoon’s
honored.
On May 4 “The Widow’s Might,” Eric
Bedford’s three-act comedy, will be
staged at the Savoy for the Benevolent
Fund of the A.J.A. The widow will be
played by Gwen Sherwood, the girl in
this Sydney Riley photograph. Miss
Sherwood’s work in Arthur Greenaway’s
repertory company will be remembered.
She has trod the boards under his direc-
tion as Olivia in “Twelfth Night” and
Oberon in “A Midsummer Night’s
Dream”; and the mike has broadcast
her in these parts. She wrote “Gay
Ghosts” and produced it for the Public
Service Music and Dramatic Society, and
took the part of the wife in that laugh-
raiser “Meet the Wife.” W. Lane Bay-
liff, who is producing the “Widow,” has
played with Arliss and Henry Irving.
The ball given by the Field Engineer
and Signal Officers’ mess was an out-
standing success. Everybody said so.
The men wore their scarlet mess jackets ;
the women wore coronets with their
newest dresses; tables bristled with war-
like decorations and models of attack
and defence, which had to be explained
to the best girl. Sooner or later everyone
paid a visit to Lieut. K. Hawkey’s table
to see just how a bridge would be
guarded by a squadron of Light Horse.
The setting was Australian, so no one
had to ask what the little wallabies and
rabbits were that were seen scuttling to
cover. There were signallers busy at
work, and machine-guns ready for
action. The brains that thought this out
belong to Captain N. E. Phillips. The
Wentworth’s newly cream-panelled walls
and golden lighting threw a softening
glow over all.
Brigadier-General O. F. Phillips and
Mrs. Phillips were received by president
of the mess Col. R. F. Smith and Mrs.
Smith. Mrs. Phillips’s dress was all red
and black chevron stripes on a parch-
ment ground. The presentation red roses
were just the right shade. Mrs. Smith
wrapped herself in pastel-pink laces, then
added a blue sash. Mrs. Keating flew
oyster grey chiffons. She brought her
Colonel husband ; so did Mrs. Holland.
The dance secretary, Lieut. W. T. Briggs,
entertained a large party, Mrs. Briggs
hostessing in ground-length black velvets.
This is how Falk’s camera sees Mona
Wade, who has made a niche for herself
in London as a concert manager. Miss
Wade met Dame Clara about 12 years
ago, and acted on her suggestion that she
should spend a talked-of holiday in
America, travelling on the same boat as
the Rumfords. After a few months Mona
went to England, visited the singer at her
home at Oxford, became her private
secretary, and four years later found her-
self managing her employer’s Indian tour.
After that she just went on managing,
doing much work for the London impres-
sario, John Powell, during his celebrity
concert season. Among others she has
managed for John McCormack and De
Pachmann, and the whole of the arrang-
ing of Pavlova’s last two tours of Eng-
land was left in the Australian girl’s
hands.
The Royal Packet Navigation Co.’s
Nieuw Holland garlanded herself in
jewel-like red, white and blue lights for
the “Night in Bali” dance in aid of the
Adult Deaf and Dumb, and Mrs. Bakker,
all white moires, welcomed vice-royalty
in the absence of her general-manager
husband. . Incense burned in brass
braziers; everybody wore a spray of
frangipanni (another gift to the com-
mittee, this from Fred Searle, who had
it brought down from Queensland by
’plane). There were films showing life
in Bali, Borneo and other tropical
islands; a Balinese ballet arranged by
Mrs. M. V. Bailey, in which golden-
crowned, colorfully-swathed girls took
part; and a tableau of seven goddesses,
all glittering trains and towering jewelled
headdresses. While waiting for the vice-
regals there was time to note that Mrs.
Lammers’s dress and coat were in softest
powder blues ; that Mrs. Harry Drans-
field’s black laces were brightened with
rose patterned silver tissue; that the
Mayoral lady’s presentation berries
blended in with her red velvets, and that
Chief Justice Jordan’s lady had wrapped
herself in Persian-red chiffons. Lady
Game’s moires were lily-of-the-valley
leaf green; a black velvet coat with a
de luxe fox collar kept out the icy wind.
Elise Budge’s toe-length black velvets
were unrelieved except for the attractive
sunburn of her back.
Royalty came to this dance —Prince
Molungoo Whennai (the Lud Mayor
bought his portrait at the recent Water
Colorists’ show). He wore all his orders
and a sacred necklet of leopard’s teeth.
He has very decided views. Education,
he says, doesn’t make a man wise, so
what’s the use of it to the worker? All
this in very fluent English (he was edu-
cated in India). In his country there are
no Judges. The King makes the law and
administers it. The young man is
on a world tour. The ring he wears
brings him, he says, not material pros-
perity but a contented mind.
Do Japanese children play hide-and-
seek? If they do, what a glorious time
they must have in their gardens. For a
Japanese garden, according to Professor
Sadler’s talk on this subject to members
of the E.-S.U., is planned so that, no
matter how small it is, the whole cannot
be viewed at any one time. Coolness and
spaciousness are suggested even in flat
gardens by means of water-worn step-
ping-stone pathways, bordered by trees
and meandering into distant glades, or
by running streams spanned by rustic
bridges.
Unlike us, the Japanese makes his
garden first, then the house is built and
fitted in to make a harmonious whole.
The garden, when the side shutters of
the house are opened, becomes part of
the room. That is one reason why the
evergreen pine is such a favorite. The
difference between the garden of the rich
man and that of the poor lies in the size.
But to the stranger this is unimportant,
for trees and shrubs and all growing
things are in proportion. Visitors to
Japan should remember the saying “The
richer the man the simpler the gate” if
they want to see the real Japan. The
bizarre gate leads to the very often over-
ornamented public gardens —made to
give the tourist something to talk about
when he gets home.
The Lud Mayor’s lady has set up the
sign for her Clothing Fund, and has sent
out an SOS from the Town Hall for
slightly-used clothing, boots, blankets,
materials or money to buy materials to
be made up by willing helpers.
There is to be a musicale in the
Mayoress’s rooms to-morrow. But the
big money-raiser will be a card party on
May 31. To this you will bring your
own supper, but the T.H. will supply
crockery, tea and coffee.
On Friday, the Independents will

Chatter
The “shop” students let off their steam
of exuberance with “Swot Next” to
packed houses at the Comedy. If the
Lud Mayor felt any trepidation at ap-
pearing he hid it under an expression of
benignity, and a broad smile when the
flashlight danced unexpectedly on his
box. For the show bristled with gags.
Prize-winning odes, etc., were tossed
about by the centenary committee, censor
Agar, Mrs. Britomarte Hotcross, Sidney
Wire, Dr. Boloney, Sir James Parrot,
Alderman Peabody and a Worshipful
Mayor. Charles Zwar, who can undulate
his eyebrows in the necessary degenerate
manner, was responsible for most of the
music. “Spring Cleaning,” treated in the
language (more or less) of Shakspeare,
was a huge success. A skit on the silent
films galloped along merrily to the
death of the villain when somebody
kicked the “machine” and the mummers
had to unwind themselves in slow motion
back to the beginning. Young Catherine
Duncan revelled in being a voluptuous
vamp and several kinds of ultra-modern
wife. A very youthful maiden who en-
joyed gambolling through her parts was
Prudence Timmins. Cynthia Keon-
Cohen rehearsed the ballet and whirled
a bubble of white skirt in the bolero.
Norman Atkyns filled divers roles, and
Forsyth Ross put across his juggling in
the true professional manner, wearing
only a pair of brief black pants. A male
ballet is always a success when it jumps
about as nymphs. Three muscular lads
raised howls of mirth as tumblers in a
skit on the Cicily Courtneidge film
“Gentlemen of the King.” Kathleen
Hughes waxed romantic in opera with
her lover “Epiglottis” (John Clements),
while a weedy parent in pyjamas sharp-
ened a long, thin knife. The only dull
moments in the show were provided by
crooners.
The Quamby Club, always an attrac-
tive setting for a party, was gay in
autumnal shades for Mrs. E. R. Stewart’s
tea and chatter, which revolved round
Mrs. E. Buffer Allan. The guest-of-honor
wore black trappings purchased abroad
and a snug silver fox. Black, also with
a mingling and disappearing thread of
white, was chosen by Mrs. Stewart for
her suit. Among guests were Mrs.
Percy Blackbourn, Mrs. Stuart Brunton,
Mrs. J. A. Maconochie, of Derinallum,
and Mrs. Bryon Cumming, of Camper-
down.
As regularly as birds migrate does
Mrs. Robert Lindsay leave England be-
fore winter sets in. Before Joyce and
Rosemary were married they accom-
panied their mother on her annual scurry
across the world. This year Joyce, who
did not have to change her name on her
marriage (she’s Mrs. Martin Lindsay),
has come, too, for her husband is explor-
ing in Polar regions. Mrs. Lindsay likes
the sun and settles down to bask in it
all the summer in Westralia, where she
has a house at Yanchep and owns a slice
of the perpetually shifting sands of
Jurien Bay. Before going home she has
skipped over to Melbourne for a chat
with her sister, Mrs. George Landale.
Mrs. Landale gave a party this week in
an atmosphere of pink, blue and green
hydrangeas bunched in her Toorak
home. Mrs. Lindsay shook hands with
her old friends in a shimmer of green
under gold lace. Foamy chiffons with
pastel tints blended upon grey crept
about Mrs. Landale’s ankles. Daughter
Janet wreathed her arm with a trail of
flowers, and Diana’s pink muslin burst
into a neck ruffle and fluttering ends to
a blue sash. Mrs. W. J. T. Clarke wore
her pearls and black satin. Among
guests were the Russell Clarke, the Leigh
Falkiner, the Norman Grover and the
Humphrey Clegg couples, Dr. and Mrs.
A. Law and Judge and Mrs. Williams.
The Thorold Harpers and Mrs. Harper’s
sister, Sheila Anton, saved up the Oron-
say’s stay in port for their good-byes to
Melbourne. After three months spent in
Australia they boarded the steamer in
Sydney. Their late-afternoon party was
at the Lyceum, where the drawing-room
was splashed with dahlias as vivid as
radiator cones glowing in opposition to
the snap of cold weather. The hostess
pinned orchids to her ocean-blue flami-
sol, while the down of summer ermine
lay upon Miss Anton’s green ensemble.
The two Winter girls, Carmen and
Carina, were there, tall, slim and attrac-
tive. In the throng were the Bob
Camerons, of Perth, the Stephen Mar-
gretts, a new arrival from Germany, Frau-
lein Schmidt, Serita Grass-y-Fort, the
W. D. Murray Smiths and a sprinkling
of the professorial and professional.
With the first rains golfers succumb
to the grip of the smooth green fairway
and are already booking lessons and
making good resolutions for regular
practice. Woodlands clubhouse has ex-
panded ; there are new locker-rooms and
the cosy “pot-room” seems to shrink
proportionately as the large new bar
nears completion. To keep pace with
these improvements the associates have
decided to get themselves some new fur-
niture, and to that end held a guest-day
this week. In the morning a nine-hole
Canadian foursome resulted in a win
and boxes of hankies for Miss B. Jardine
and Mrs. Seymour. Of the intrepid souls
who finished 18 holes in the afternoon’s
downpour, Miss J. Sinclair, Mrs. Hogan
and Mrs. Tipton kept the best cards dry
enough to read. Many women dis-
covered the attractions of bridge round
a blazing fire, with hidden lighting pick-
ing up the colors in huge bowls of
gladioli and dahlias. President Mrs.
Colombie, all in misty-grey, vice-presi-
dent Mrs. Ampt, whose knitting seemed
to grow inches in the afternoon, captain
Mrs. R. C. Daly, in a tweed suit and
a bunch of cherries, and sec. Mrs.
Palmer did their official calculations on
the verandah. Prizes were donated by
Mrs. Colombie, Mrs. Uren, Mrs. Still-
well, Mrs. George Hore, Mrs. Ampt and
Mrs. Little.
Scientists are on the track of the viru-
lent wog who causes pyorrhea, with
America a lap ahead in the chase. From
Hollywood Dr. Arthur W. Lufkin has
come to give a series of lectures and
demonstrations on the subject to Aus-
tralian dentists. This is his wife, pictured
by Jack Cato. The visitors, who are
guests of Dr. and Mrs. R. M. Gillies at
Kew, have with them their tall only son,
aged 16, who is thoroughly enjoying his
holiday, particularly early-morning gal-
lops on his host’s horses. Harlan’s
chosen career is the Air Force branch of
the Navy. Mrs. Lufkin has an engaging
personality and literary tastes. She has
written verses, editorials and sketches,
and there’s a niche on her library shelves
for books of psychology and meta-
physics. The doctor will lecture in Syd-
ney next month, and it will be June
before the American trio get back to
California.
The C.W.A. has rallied troops to Mel-
bourne for its big annual week. A record
number of delegates have met and talked
and learned first-hand how the associa-
tion’s tentacles have pushed their way
outback. The social event of the rally,
with the Yarra branch as hostesses, was
held at Scott’s, where gold flowers and
tablecloths and green branches repre-
sented the association’s colors. Mrs.
Humphrey Clegg, with pink roses at her
throat, handed a bouquet to the State
president, Mrs. R. G. Beggs, who was
wrapped in blackberry velvet. From
Sydney came distinguished office-holders
like Mrs. Hubert Fairfax (she is vice-
president of the Associated Country
Women of the World) and Mrs. Matt
Sawyer.
Throughout the week women trooped
down to the C.W.A. shop in the lower
regions of the Town Hall in search of
“some little thing—cheap.” But they
emerged laden with parcels, for every-
thing was cheap, prices were marked dis-
tinctly and saleswomen did not fluster
their quarry by pursuit. Toys were par-
ticularly enticing. All the “Alice in
Wonderland” people seemed to have
drifted in after the tea-party. There were
furry native-bears, some with offspring,
monkeys pink and bearded and a galah
so lifelike that he may cause an upheaval
if there is a live parrot in his future
home. Rabbit hot-water bags will keep
many toes warm this winter, and doll
stocking-bags will make a stitch in time
a matter of seconds.
This is Mrs. Tom Paterson, who on
April 28 will say good-bye for six months
to her husband and small Judith and
Diane. She is off on the Monterey with
her parents, the Arthur H. Powell couple,
for her first trip to America and Europe.
Mrs. Paterson has one brother, and her
younger sister is the attractive wife of
knight-o’-the-air Kingsford Smith. Por-
trait by Broothorn.
Geneva is on the itinerary of Mrs.
Claude Couchman, who is travelling
abroad for health and pleasure: but she’ll
go there as a guest, for she has been
chosen as women’s national representa-
tive for the League of Nations Assembly.
Mrs. Couchman is used to the limelight
and the society of public spirits. She’s
been vice-president of the National
Council of Women, president of the Aus-
tralian Women’s National League, a
member of the committee of the English-
Speaking Union, a fellow of the Royal
Empire Society, and she’s also a member
of the Broadcasting Commission.
For the Rose Show perfume from
pedigreed roses (carefully nursed through
damaging January rains) drifted through
the cotton-wool fall of snowflakes to be
lost under the indigo roof of the barn-
like Forty Club. Admission was com-
paratively expensive—a florin a look—
the money collected going to the Mel-
bourne Hospital. Tall and slim in vases,
clustered into baskets and table decors
with old-fashioned ramblers and knobby
seedcases strewn round the feet of the
bowls, specimens were all colors and
sizes. The whitest was Frau Karl
Druschki; the purest gold, Golden
Gleam; and the deepest red, Chateau de
Clos Vougat; Those who patronised the
Rose Ball in the evening had the Show
thrown in free with their dance tickets.
Jennie Brenan’s pupils peeped at the
dancers out of rose bowers, each one
decorated with a different variety of rose.
Fay Robinson’s Blackboy effort was the
winner. Sunday Wenman solo-danced
and the committee dashed about all night
with hot soup and oysters.
Adelaide’s annals:
At the floral festival on Adelaide Oval in
honor of Lady Hore-Ruthven, thousands of
Girl Guides represented flowers and formed
patterns, while tiny ones danced. Nothing like
it has been seen before. The vice-regal lady
appreciated the tribute.
The attendance at Cheltenham was affected
by the performance on the Oval, so it was
not the usual large crowd over which chair-
man J. H. Morish and his wife presided. Mrs.
Morish wore a smart tailored black cloth coat
with a black fox fur collar.
Actress Josie Melville is to marry Jack, only
son of Mr. and Mrs. C. R. J. Glover, for-
merly our Lud Mayor and Mayoress.
Good luck attended the vice-regals in the
matter of weather for their two garden par-
ties. One woman had an unfortunate experi-
ence. Just as she was concentrating upon her
bob to his Ex. the wind caught her velvet hat
and bowled it along the lawn with one of the
A.D.Cs. in hot pursuit. She was so over-
come that when he popped it on her head
back to front she didn’t bother to adjust it.
The number of guests entertained at the two
garden parties was reputed to be 3000. Large
marquees were erected on the lawn, where
afternoon-tea was served, and small tables set
about for the convenience of guests. His Ex.
gave tone to one party by wearing a pale grey
top hat with a black hatband. R. T. Melrose,
correct to the minute, also turned up in togs
that would delight a Bond-street tailor. Lady
Hore-Ruthven wore a shaved ermine-dyed fawn
coat with a sable fur collar and a brown toque
and she carried a bunch of water-lilies. At the
second party she was in brown-and-white
figured silk, a brown marocain coat, and a
brown hat. Most of the women wore black
suits and black hats, and the effect was dull.
Mrs. A. E. V. Richardson was smart in black
chiffon velvet with sleeves and yoke of white
angel-skin lace and a black velvet hat. Two
green toilettes, in the new olive tone, were quite
a relief. Mrs. Walter Duncan’s had a scarf
collar of green and gold lamd and a small hat
to match. Helen Seeck’s ripple crepe suit was
worn with a silver fox fur- and a Robin Hood
felt hat.
A dance was given at Craigbuie, Knights-
bridge, the residence of Mrs. A. Macdiarmid,
who joined forces with her daughter, Mrs. Mal-
colm Ashwin, and her daughter-in-law, Mrs.
Stanley Murray, in giving a ball for her four
granddaughters, Margaret and Mary Ashwin
and Alison and Joan Murray. Joan wore white
romaine with a cascade of frills on the train
and a coronet of twisted silver lame, and she
carried a bouquet of white roses. Mrs. Mac-
diarmid was gowned in fine black lace. Mrs.
M. Ashwin chose dark tomato-toned silk lace,
and Mrs. S. Murray wore a pale pink wind-
swept satin. Margaret Ashwin was in wine-
toned marocain, with touch of silver lame;
Alison Murray’s daffodil pebble satin was cut
on slim lines and Mary Ashwin wore a pale-
green taffeta with a petunia sash. Chief Jus-
tice Murray was present, and Miss Murray,
gowned in violet silk lace. The garden was
hung with hundreds of colored electric lights.
Perth’s social budget;
Archgaiters Le Fanu, with the Rev. Stillwell
as right-hand man, pronounced a blessing over
the Walsh-James pair. Dahlias and Michaelmas
daisies adorned St. Mary’s, where Judy (knight
Walter James and his lady’s one ewe lamb)
paced the aisle to a choral accompaniment. A
long Limerick lace veil fell over lily-textured
bridal satins, which fitted the arm snugly to
the wristlet of orange-blossom; pearls and
gold lame fashioned the swoop of the floating
panelled sash, and gold peeped from the satin
roses and leaves at the shoulder. The pale jade
crinkle crepe clinging to ’maids Beth Johnston
and Mary Le Fanu ran to tiny trains and out-
linings of silver lame, and their green tulle
picture hats were wrought with silver leaves.
Toasts were honored at the Esplanade.
Members of the 200 Club defied superstition
by holding their inaugural dance on a Friday,
and decorating the Masonic Hall, Subiaco, with
goosefiesh designs of skulls and skeletons.
Appetites at the buffet supper were not affected,
however. Alice Biggs wended her way there in
deep orchid satins; Helen Inkpen’s taffetas
were cloudy amber; Ursula Goyder’s aqua-
marine georgettes boasted a wealth of tiny
frills; Viola Bathgate combined blue and pink
in floral chiffons; Betty Sudlow edged black
chiffon velvet with white bunny; Barbara
Unbehaum’s white crinkle crepe was flecked
with green, and Betty Shann applied gold tissue
to warm brown velvet.
Flyaway-back draperies marked the bridal
procession at St. George’s Cathedral when
Flower Southwood plighted her troth to Bill
Evans. Chantilly lace swung in a deep cowl
from the nape of the neck, with more cowls at
the shoulders of the long, ruched sleeves. A
brilliant halo held capwise the exquisite lace
veil, which cascaded down the train and eddied
around the bouquet of white roses, orange-
blossom and smilax. Cowls draped the back
of Marjorie Southwood and Barbara Evans’s
coral georgettes, which developed a goffered
frill at the knee-line, then trailed off into trains.
The W. E. Southwoods’ home rang with re-
joicings, and the chatelaine greeted the guests
in Egyptian-blue lace, with the forbidden osprey
perched in her cute little hat.
The Pleiades Club saw the ballroom fes-
tooned with wistaria and peach-blossom bloom-
ing in asparagus fern for its first-of-the-season
dance. Orchestral strains came from the palm-
concealed dais, and goodly viands emerged
from between gladioli and dahlias in the dining-
room. President Mrs. G. S. Norton lent her
blue, black and white floral presence; Beryl
Birchley’s blush-pink velvets occupied the dance
committee’s chair; sec.-treas. Alys King gyrated
in fur-edged gold craquelle; Mrs. Phil Parker
brought her moss-green laces from India;
Muriel Jacobs’s black Chantillies floated airily,
and Joyce Colliver was demure in dove-grey
matelasse.
The Speck speaks:—
His Ex. was roped in by the Tennis Asso-
ciation at St. Helen’s to present the trophies
to tournament winners. Thompson’s Hall was
full for the association’s ball, and the v.-r.
supper-table, set in the ante-room, was deco-
rated with crystal baskets of yellow nastur-
tiums.
Art students of Hobart Tech. College en-
joyed themselves at a nautical fancy-dress
dance, bringing the flavor of the briny into
the ballroom with representations of rftatelots,
British and French, mermaids, Father Neptune
and a decorative scheme suggested by the
chanty “What Shall We Do with the Drunken
Sailor?” The ballroom was made to represent
a cave on the sea floor, the lights being oun-
ningly arranged to give a submarine effect.
High Commissioner Bruce favored the Speck
with his presence on a recent week-end. He
was given a reception by the Mayor, supped
at G.H. with the Governor and ate lunch with
the Chamber of Commerce —all stage functions,
of course.
The Lieut.-Gov.’s lady farewelled her sister,
Mrs. Alister Beal, at a bridge party at Wern-
dee, Augusta-road. Tables were set out in
the drawing-room for players, and a good many
later guests swelled the number round the tea-
table.
The Walter Gellibrands gave a late-afternoon
party at Hadley’s in honor of Walter’s sister,
Mrs. F. D. Robinson, who lives in England,
and her niece Brenda, who is a daughter of
Commander and Mrs. Blake, now in Switzer-
land. The A. D. Walshes, visiting the Speck
from Brisbane, shared in the welcome, and a
long list of guests enjoyed the fray. Pink and
mauve dahlias, delphiniums and mauve Easter
daisies made a bright setting for smart autumn
frocking. The hostess was in black georgette,
with a black chiffon velvet toque.
Vice-Admiral and Mrs. Alister Beal have
gone back to Blighty after a six months’ visit
to this island. Mrs. Beal, wearing navy-and-
white floral crepe with small navy hat, hostessed
a hen-party at luncheon at Hadley’s before
leaving. The table was gay with bowls of
sunset dahlias and autumn foliage.

The Meek in Heart.
BY E. DITHMACK.
OLD Dougal rode his unshod horse
down the grassy slope to the creek.
His eyes kept ceaseless watch for
signs of stray stock; his figure was
straight and commanding. In his hand
he carried the silver-headed hunting-crop
without which he was never seen, and
which he never hesitated to use on those
who offended his sense of what was right.'
Authority was respected even in Aus-
tralia fifty years ago. “Old Mister,” the
neighbors called him once they were out
of sight of those piercing eyes. Eyes
steel-grey under beetling brows; eyes
that could look through a man and see
the lie forming in his brain.
It was afternoon. The bushland was
full of a lazy silence. Alex. Dougal
thought it strange that all the birds
should suddenly have gone from the
trees; there wasn’t even a scrub magpie
about. Down in the hollow the brook
splashed and rattled fussily along, swirl-
ing over boulders and other obstruc-
tions.
He reined in his horse and began to
peer cautiously down between the thick
branches of the bottle-brush, now a
mass of glowing red blooms. The bab-
bling of the water drowned all lesser
sounds, but presently he saw the white
moleskins and faded blue shirt of Aaron
Studley. Instantly the old man sensed
mischief. Aaron and his father —both
of them pacing out the land on the other
side of the creek!
The watching eyes narrowed; he
grasped his hunting-crop in a surge of
rage, and only his Scottish caution re-
strained him from springing down the
bank.
“Aye, aye,” muttered Alex. Dougal,
shaking his head up and down “Ye can
traipse up and doon the bank the whole
o’ the day, but ye dinna ken th’ hawk
has seen ye!”
He continued to nod his head for a
few minutes, taking in their actions, while
his eyes became amused and speculative.
The chestnut horse stood quietly by, still
as his master.
“Aye, I ken the measurements, mon,”
old Dougal chuckled. behind his screen.
“Twal acres, six roods and then some,
tae say nothing o’ the three hunner-odd
acres beyant, but if ye think tae beat old
Dougal for it —weel, ye’re awake a bit
late o’ th’ morn.”
The forbidding frown left his face, and
he chuckled richly. He pulled his horse
back a little, mounted and rode away.
He gave no further thought for the stray-
ing stock, but rode home as quickly as
possible.
“Alan, Alan!” called out Mrs. Dougal
hastily. “Here’s your feyther coming,
and things dinna seem tae be right. Ye’d
better be busy, lad.”
Old Dougal strode into the house and
went straight to the calendar hanging on
the wall. He studied it for a moment,
then bawled out imperatively: “Alan! ”
“Yes, father.”
“D’ye ken th’ date o’ th’ next Land
Courrt?”
The boy glanced at the calendar. “To-
morrow ’tis. I marked it in with red
pencil—there.”
“Aye, aye. Weel, lad, on wi’ yer
togs. We start for toon th’ nicht, and
we’ll be there betimes to-morrow. I’m
putting in for that block o’ land beyant.”
Alan hurried off, whilst Alex, ramped
round, with mother at his beck and call,
packing a valise, getting out his good
clothes and preparing a hasty cup of tea.
“That snake Studley and his son are
after that block o’ land,” he informed the
boy as they ate their meal. “Belike
they’ll put in an application to th’ Land
Courrt for it, but if we can get there
to-morrow we’ll be first, and it will be
gone before his letter gets in.”
“It’s a wonder you never thought of
it yourself before,” Alan ventured.
“Thought o’ it! For why should a
mon pay rent when he can run his stock
on it free o’ charrge? It adjoins ma
paddock—damned cheek o’ anyone else
tae.want it!”
Old Dougal’s sense of justice was out-
raged. He’d show them whether they
could come on to his land, measuring it
out like lords!
They rode away as night fell. Mrs.
Dougal bade her son a furtive good-bye
and slipped a parcel of . food into his
saddle-bag, knowing the lad would be
hungry before the dawn broke. For the
stern, upright figure leading the way
down the paddock she had no loving
thought; that had been crushed from her
long ago.
They rode at a steady pace. The nearest
District Court was forty-odd miles away,
and if the horses were to travel all night
they must not force the pace.
Alan did not speak. He was sixteen,
and full of a wisdom beyond his years.
His business ■ was to follow that upright
figure ahead, asking no questions, obey-
ing all orders.
The moon, almost at the full, sailed
behind a scud of clouds, giving a ghostly
appearance to the two horsemen. From
every farm lights streamed out across the
paddocks, but the two figures slipped
quietly past, giving no greeting as the
dogs rushed out. The clouds passing
over the face of the moon threw dark
shadows across the track, then, hurrying
on, left the white grass drenched with a
silvery light.
Alan, riding sombrely behind, won-
dered what thoughts passed through that
upflung head of his father. Was it pos-
sible that the magic of the night could
touch him, soften him to humanity?
As the night advanced the lights be-
came fewer in the scattered houses.
Everything was still, with the stillness of
midnight. Out in the fields the ricks
loomed whitely ; the fresh smell of mown
hay, pungent and earthy, was carried
to them on the wind.
It grew cold and the boy’s fingers stif-
fened. Still the alert figure set the pace.
They skirted round hills where
little whispering rivulets trickled down,
glistening in the white light of the moon.
Old Dougal set his horse to a canter as
they reached level country. For miles
it stretched where cloud shadows raced
over its undulations. The long, dry grass
made little whispering sounds as the wind
rustled through it.
They came to a shallow creek fringed
by sombre trees, and the horses, as they
splashed through, paused to drink. The
sucking sound as they drew in the water
seemed to shatter the silence. Old
Dougal pushed back his hat and raised
his face to the star-hung sky. The water
gleamed here and there as the moon
shone down through the pall of trees,
stray breaths of the damp, sweet blooms
filling the air.
For several minutes old Dougal sat
with his face to the sky while the water
dripped softly from the horses’ lips.
Then, without a word, he spurred his
horse forward and up the bank.
The night was far advanced now. Pre-
sently the moon slipped down behind the
hills, only now and again being visible
where the ridges dipped. Through the
dim light they rode, where the hillsides
were pocked with old grey tree-stumps
and the ringbarked trees stood starkly.
Soon the stars paled; trees and fence-
posts began to take shape in the murky
light of the dawn. In the east the first
pale streak showed, conquering the fad-
ing stars.
The two riders breasted a rise and
reined in for a while, watching the com-
ing of day. As they sat motionless it
flamed to life, quivering for a moment
at its birth, then bursting dver the land
in a joyous announcement of being. The
first note of the butcher-bird’s song
flew clear and melodious across the
silence; little, tentative twitterings came
from tree and shrub—the bush was
awake ready for the work of the day.
Old Dougal took off his hat and bared
his head to the dawn. “The Lorrd be
praised!” he- intoned fervently, then,
replacing his hat, rode on and into the
town.
At ten o’clock he was at the court-
house and chuckled huskily as he put
through his application. He could see
old Studley pacing out that cultivable
piece of land ; could see the dark wrath
of his face when he heard how he’d been
forestalled.
He celebrated his victory before re-
turning home. Alan waited patiently,

cooling his heels outside the hotel, listen-
ing to the arrogant voice of his father
raised in heated argument. He knew
that it would have ended thus which-
ever way things went —a drink to cele-
brate, a drink to drown his defeat.
Two days after his return home Old
Dougal accosted Studley on his newly
acquired land. His rage leapt to life as
he dismounted and strode towards the
little bandy-legged man on the creek-
bank.
“Oot o’ this, mon! ” he bellowed, shak-
ing his riding-crop and advancing on his
neighbor. “Oot o’ this! D’ye no’ ken
this is ma rightful property, granted tae
me at the last Land Courrt sittings? Oot
ye go!”
Amos grasped his gun and turned to
defend himself.
“You dirty swine!” he flamed. “Take
one more step and I’ll shoot. I’ll shoot,
I tell ye, and do it in self-defence.”
“Shoot? Bah, ye wouldna!”
He strode up to the man, his fearless,
overbearing manner staying any further
action. He pressed his body against the
muzzle of the gun, his grey eyes gleam-
ing at his cowering adversary.
“Shoot, mon, shoot!” he thundered.
“D’ye no’ ken I’m here? Shoot, and hae
done wi’ such talk.”
Amos lowered the gun in futile rage.
“Ye’re nothing but a bullying coward,”
he flung at him. “Ye’re a yellow dingo,
sneaking on a man behind his back.”
“Ye’ll no’ call me a dingo and live tae
repeat it,” Dougal roared. He reached
out and caught Amos by the scruff of the
neck, as a cat might lift a kitten. His
riding-crop gave formidable punishment
before Studley’s roars brought his son
racing towards him.
“Now,” panted Dougal, “set the law
on me and be damned tae ye! This is
ma property, so get off!”
“I’ve a witness, and I’ll have ye up
for this,” Amos threatened. “To-day’s
work will cost ye more than ye’ll care to
part with.”
“Aye, do,” Dougal invited. “I’ll pay
and be privileged to hae thrashed ye.”
But, anger having died down, “Old
Mister” thought things over. It would
cost a fair penny, and he up to his
eyes already. But more than that was
the hurt to his pride, the knowledge that
a man like Amos Studley should get the
better of him. The neighbors would
snigger among themselves —they would
rejoice to know that the hawk had been
winged at last. It galled him terribly to
think that he should lose prestige among
his fellow-men—he who had overridden
them as a monarch for so long.
Thoughtfully and humbly he prayed
that a miracle might happen to save him
from ignominy.
However, when at length the summons
was served upon him, he went about the
place with all his old arrogance. The
Lord would provide.
Alan was bidden to ride with his father
to town for the case. But, before leav-
ing the old man called his wife and son
to him, and the three knelt in prayer.
Like Abraham of old, he lifted his face
to Heaven and called down a divine
blessing on his acts.
“And now, Lorrd,” he concluded, “I
leave the issue o’ this matter unto Thee.
Let mine enemies be dumbfounded ; let
them be delivered into ma hands, and let
me be triumphant. If”—he added as an
afterthought—“it be Thy will.”
Once again he took the road to town,
but this time openly and in the light of
day. Alan rode beside him, his heir
and right-of-hand. The old man’s
defiant bearing forbade comment on his
mission, though most of the neighbors,
full of sly satisfaction, were riding to the
same destination, anticipating a good
chuckle at the ultimate defeat of “Old
Mister.”
Amos, with a couple of hours’ start,
had pulled up at the half-way hotel, where
he and his followers quenched their
thirst. Others, quite impartial in their
backing, joined them, so that soon a
good crowd had gathered. Amos, hoping
to gain their adherence, treated them all
generously and drank freely himself,
boasting of his enmity to Alex. Dougal.
“I’ll show th’ bullying coward he can’t
do as he likes with me,” he crowed.
“This’ll put a stop to his lordly ways.”
“Wasn’t there some trouble over a
piece of land?” one of the onlookers
suggested helpfully. “He put one over
you, I heard.”
“He did that. And, when he saw me
on the land, ordered me off as if I was
a dog. It was because I stood up to
him that he hit me with that damned
riding-crop of his, as Aaron here can
testify.”
Through a cloud of dust they saw old
Dougal and his son approaching. It was
a hot day and the inn looked inviting.
The two riders reined up and prepared
to dismount, when Amos came zig-
zagging out, waving a mug of beer.
The cloud of interested onlookers
lounging on the verandah grinned in
anticipation of some fun.
Seeing “Old Mister,” Amos raised his
empty fist and shook it triumphantly.
“Ah, I have ye now, ye !” he
gloated. “I have ye now. If I want to
go on yer land I’ll go on, and if I
want to shoot ye I’ll shoot. I’ll shoot ye
like a dog th’ first time I’m ordered off
again.”
“Ha!”
Old Dougal sat erect as a young pine-
tree, his face purpling, his lips firmly set
as though to check the rushing tide of
anger. His steely eyes swept over the
crowd, quelling the jeers that rose, intimi-
dating them. Then after a moment his
big voice rang out, compelling and arrest-
ing. Against his will every man paid
respectful heed.
“Ma neebor here threatens me wi’
bodily harrm, as ye’ve all hearrd.”
A surprised, though assenting, murmur
ran through the crowd, but was checked
as the dominant voice rose again.
“Ye all ken I’ve no fear o’ him. ’Tis
no’ the way o’ a Dougal tae take that
sorrt o’ thing, but, ma faith, I didna think
tae find him fall intae ma hands sae
easily! ”
The crowd on the verandah, finding
the joke turned against Amos, applauded,
though disappointed that nothing more
exciting had happened. Amos stood
open-mouthed and foolish, wondering
what he had done.
“Ye’ll hear more o’ this to-morrow,”
old Dougal flung back as he pulled his
horse around. “I’ll be off now tae take
oot a summons against ye for using
threatening and obscene language on the
public highway.” Then he saluted the
crowd and rode off, his upright figure
defiant to the last sight of it.
Evan Bardsley enlightened Amos, and
what Evan did not know about the law
was scarcely worth the gleaning.
“You should have kept your tongue
quiet until the case was over,” he crowed.
“There’s plenty here will give evidence
for the old man, and now you’ve no
chance at all. Take it from me.”
Amos, intimidated at once, sought out
“Old Mister” when he got to town, and
offered to withdraw the case.
The old man pretended to give the
matter weighty consideration. “Ye’ll pay
all ma expenses?” he countered at last.
“I’ve thought o’ that,” Amos said sul-
lenly. “I suppose a fiver’ll cover them?”
“Weel” “Old Mister” thought
again. “Aye,” he said warily, “but I’ll
hae it in cash, mind ye. I’ll no’ hae ye
producing evidence o’ threats.”
“Ho!” Amos tried to infuse a sneer
into his voice. “And how,” he asked,
not to be outdone, “how am I to know
that ye won’t come at me again?”
“Mon!” Old Dougal rose to his full
height, brows beetling, eyes flashing.
“D’ye no’ ken I’m a Dougal ? Is that
no’ sufficeent guarantee o’ fair play? Oot
o’ this —oot o’ ma sight before I thrash
ye tae yer death! ”
“Well, six pounds then,” Amos offered
quickly, dodging to the door. “I’ll make
it six to settle at once.”
“Mon” —old Dougal’s voice was a
caress —’“ye’re talkin’ beesness th’ noo.
Pay up and gang awa hame before ye
land intae fresh trouble. I’ll no’ be
delayin’ ye.”
He chuckled richly as he gathered up
the money and called for his reckoning
at the inn.
“Ye see, ma boy,” he admonished Alan
as later they took the long road home,
“it pays tae put yer faith in th’ Lorrd.
He willna see the downtrodden op-
pressed, nor the meek in hearrt defeated.”
Memories—Anzac Day, 1934.
There are bluebells dancing gaily in the sweep
of upland grasses,
There are yellow roses nodding in the lane,
And the fields are brown and golden where
the light or shadow passes,
But their beauty brings a sudden stab of
pain,
For you will not know the glory of the
autumn world again.
Flash of stream or face of flower brings the
old, old memories thronging
Of the days to which the spirit turns and
clings,
Till at times the heart grows heavy with the
ache of hopeless longing
When the low wind through the roses sways
and sings,
Or a bird spars up to Heaven with a flash
of dewy wings.
Still to you the first glad greeting of this
splendid day is given,
It shall pass by shining starways, and the
unknown suns, aglow;
And I dream that where it finds you, at the
gates of Highest Heaven,
Heart’s Beloved, you shall hear and, hearing,
know
That your memory lives undying in the heart
of one below.

RING-LOCK
The Strongest
Joint ever
devised .. /
A fence is only as strong as its joints. That’s
why “Cyclone” is the strongest fence made ...
because of the rigid strength of the famous
Cyclone Ringlock ; plus the fact that
“Cyclone” is the ONLY fence made through*
out of HARD steel wire.
THE JOINT TEST
N°2
THE “JOINT TEST”
Grasp an upright wire above and below a
joint (see sketch), then wrench the upright
first one way and then the other. You’ll
never shift the Ring-lock joint. It’s rigid and
immovable. “Cyclone” Ringlock is the ONLY
fence made throughout of HARD steel wire.
It is absolutely unaffected by weather ; the
longer the fence is erected the tighter the
joints become.
There is the correct type of “Cyclone” Ringlock for
every class of fencing (sheep, lambs, cattle, horses,
pigs). For paddock subdivision—whether temporary
or permanent —Cyclone Ringlock fence stands alone.
“ CYCLONE ” is not a “type” of fence , but is our
registered trade mark, and can only be legally applied
to fencing manufactured by us.

WEEK-END AT GREEN’S RIVER.
BY E. M. LILLEY.
T 1 7 HEN my friend Georgy (Lieut.-
YY Commander G. C. Henry to the
’ world) gave up the sea he took to
the land in a gentlemanly sort of way,
and bought a small farm down where
Green’s River flows into the sea.
Georgy had asked me down for the
week-end. When the sun went over the
yardarm we took our drinks and deck-
chairs out on to his verandah. A quarter
of a mile out to sea a liner was getting
into her stride, looking every one of her
twenty thousand tons as she passed some
belated yachts straggling home with the
light midsummer evening breeze. In
every way, in every direction, the pros-
pect pleased me ; but it awoke resent-
ment in Georgy in that one particular
man could be so vile.
“You know my neighbor Smith, don’t
you?” he asked.
“Approximately,” I admitted.
“Do you know what they’d call that
man in Siam?”
I didn’t—not knowing the language ;
so he told me. He told me, likewise,
what they would call him in Portu-
gal, Alexandria, Cyprus, the Gold Coast,
China and Peru. (Georgy had travelled
about a bit when he was in the navy.)
He finished with alternative epithets that
a man might hear in Simonstown, where
the population is bilingual. I recognised
the English word.
“What’s he been doing to you?” I
asked.
“You know that paddock of mine up
by the road just as you turn in to come
down to the house?”
“Yes; you’ve got a nice bit of feed
there,” I said.
“A nice bit of feed is right,” he agreed.
“The nicest bit of feed left anywhere
about here, by a long way. Well, Herb —
my man, you know —and I have been
saving that paddock for our own cows.
Now, if you’d gone up to that paddock
any night this week, do you know what
you’d have found there?”
“Yes; that’s easy. One or more of
Smith’s cows. Right—ten marks. Have
you spoken to Smith about it?”
“I have,” said Georgy, “and the blighter
gave me the soft answer that made me
wrathy. He pitched me a yarn about a
particular cow of his that simply won’t
stay in her own backyard. He said
she’d get through any fence man ever
made—or else she’d jump over it. But
the point is” —here Georgy wagged an
impressive forefinger at me—-“that it’s
not always the same cow. Neighbor
Smith seems, in fact, to be giving each of
his cows in turn a night out with my
Italian rye and clover.”
“How do you know it’s not the same
cow?” I asked him. “I don’t believe
you could tell one cow from another
in daylight, let alone in the dark, when
you couldn’t see the color.”
“Maybe,” he admitted, “but Herb can
tell the difference all right.”
“Well, what are you going to do about
it? ”
“To-night,” said Georgy, we will go
up to the paddock about ten o’clock, and
if we find any cow or cows there we will
take steps.”
“We? Meaning yourself and Herb?
“No ; meaning y<?u and I. I don’t
want to drag Herb into this. And now
we’ll go and see what Herb’s wife has
been able to do for us in the way of a
meal.” ~ ,
Herb’s wife had done well for us.
What with cold chicken, salad, beer and,
later on, whisky, the iron gradually
dissolved out of Georgy’s soul, and he
forgot he was a man with a grievance
while we listened to the wireless and
watched the tide run out in his decanter.
About ten o’clock we walked up to the
top paddock. Georgy was not perfectly
sober As we leaned on the fence, trying
to see through the half-moon-lighted
night, there came to our ears the unmis-
takable sound of an animal feeding. We
got over the fence and made for where
the sound came from.
We found, as we expected, a cow; an
insolent and who-might-you-be cow that,
after a contemptuous inspection of the
owner of the field, steadily and delibe-
rately went on cropping again. We stared
at her, fascinated.
“I wonder if she knows she s doing
wrong,” I said.
“The only crime this poor cow ever
committed,” George solemnly declared
to me, “was the crime of belonging to
that dough-faced blighter Smith. Who
are we to condemn her for that? I ask
you. It wasn’t her fault. Poor old lady
—she’s never had a fair chance in life.
“Well, are you going to let her spend
the night there?”
“I’ll ask the lady what she thinks
about it herself.” Georgy got down un-
steadily on his hands and knees, a foot
or so from the cow’s head. “Did the
poor old moo-cow want to leave her
nasty old master, then?” he asked her.
“Eh? What’s that? 0h!.... I see.'\
I took the cow’s snort to be an invi-
tation to Georgy not to be silly, but to
get out of her way and let her get on
with it; but he interpreted it other-
wise. “She said,” he explained, “that
Dough-face is the reason why heifers
leave home. Now, Charles,” he went on,
“this lady is determined that she’s stood
that Smith bloke long enough. She’s
come to the end of her tether.... I say!
that’s rather good, isn’t it? End of her
tether, eh? Tether you know....
thing they actually do tie cows with....
However, she’s made up her mind to
leave home —clear out and make a fresh
start in life, and we’re going to see her
through. Lead on! ” he commanded, get-
ting up again as unsteadily as he had got
down.
“Where to?” I asked.
“To my cowshed.”
“What for?” _
“We’re going to disguise her, to help
her get away.”
With some well-intentioned hindrance
from Georgy I managed to get her down
to his shed.
“What now?” I asked.
“I’ll get a lantern and then you can
bail her up.” When she was safely in
tlhe bail I looked round at Georgy, who
was thoughtfully examining the contents
of two buckets on the floor. “What
next?” I inquired.
“I don’t suppose a spot of kalsomine
will do her any harm?”
I assured him it wouldn’t if applied
externally only, and thinly at that.
“Then I think we’ll have this duck-egg
color for a background and then a few
dabs of the pink, applied casual-like here
and there on top of it.”
I gave the cow some chaff to occupy
her mind, while he got to work with his
brush. She didn’t seem to mind.
There was a good draught through
the shed and the kalsomine dried quickly.
Being a thin mixture, it did not cover
the dark-brown coat thoroughly, but
it gave her an ethereal, deathlike
pallor that was very effective. The pink
splotches, with edges undefined and
gradually merging through a succession
of mortuary shades into the duck-egg
background, seemed to hint vaguely,
but terribly, at a possible cause of the
pallor.
“Where’s she going to sleep to-night?
I asked Georgy when I felt I had looked
long enough at the dispiriting sight.
“Far, far away,” he answered. “Wait
a minute till I get Herb’s bike. I’ll get
his wife’s for you.”
It was about eleven o’clock when we
turned her out through the drive gate
on to the road and headed her in the
direction of town. For a while she kept
on making half-hearted efforts to turn
round and break through us, but after
half a mile of this she resigned herself
to her fate and went along at a steady
pace without further protest. We kept
far enough behind her to be able to pre-
tend to any interfering person who
might ask us what we were doing on
the highway with a cow at that time of
night that we had nothing to do with
her, or she with us; but we kept close
enough to be able to jog her memory
if she showed signs of forgetting what
she was there for —which was to keep
moving.
“How far are we going?” I asked
when a half-hour’s steady going had
brought us to a place where, on the road-
side, there was a patch of grass which we
let the cow nibble while we smoked.
“Right into town,” was the- answer.
So we went on by easy stages, giving
the cow a rest every mile or so. For
long stretches we pedalled slowly along
on the level or free-wheeled gently
downhill. Where the road went uphill
we got off our bikes and walked. We
met no one. A few cars passed us, but
in the still night we had warning of their
coming in plenty of time to take cover.
When we had gone about seven miles
and another mile and a half would bring
us into Old Bay, the outpost suburb of
the town, Georgy took station a couple
of hundred yards ahead of the cow, to
reconnoitre. We had not gone far in this
formation when I heard him coming
back.
“ Constable ahead! ” he reported.
“Leaning up against a lamp-post, twenty
yards this side of Hobson’s petrol pump,
having a cigarette. He hasn’t seen me
yet, but I’ve seen him, and from the cut
of his jib I’m afraid it’s P.C. Wiggins—
not nearly such a nice man as P.C. Crick,

must be
Profitable
IT is essential in the interests of the whole com
munity that the banks should make profits. Only
profit-earning banks are safe banks.
Any large bank continually losing money would
menace its depositors; those who had borrowed from
it; other financial institutions and eventually the
whole community.
The nine big Australian trading banks, through effi-
cient management, are all profitable institutions, and
therefore are a vital factor in promoting confidence
and maintaining financial stability.
The banks, however, do not occupy an exclusive
profit-earning position. Their earnings rise or fall in
line with general business conditions. Thus, in 1929
the profits of the Australian trading banks were 7.8%
on shareholders' funds. In 1932/3, in the depth of the
depression, they fell to under 2.9%.
None of these banks can make excessive profits be-
cause all these institutions are in active competition
with each other. As in business generally, so in
banking, competition ensures adequate services to
the public at lowest rates.

or even Senior-Constable Roberts. All
for the rigor of the game is P.C. Wiggins.
He wouldn’t let a poor little moo-cow
wander past him on the highway and
pretend he hadn’t noticed her. Crick
would ; Crick’s sensible. He doesn’t go
looking for trouble. But no trouble is
too much for Wiggins.”
“Then let’s give him some,” I sug-
gested.
“We’re going to. Now listen carefully.
There’s a lane up to the left, just oppo-
site the petrol pump. If I cut up through
this orchard here 1 can come out on the
lane about two hundred yards up. You
will advance with the cow for three
hundred paces and then halt and await
developments. Sooner or later you will
hear terrible and bloodcurdling cries
coming from up the lane. If and when
you hear ‘Yoicks!’ repeated three times
it will mean that P.C. Wiggins has gone
up the lane to investigate and the coast
is clear. You will then urge this cow
into a gallop. Be brutal, if necessary—
it’s in a good cause ; and don’t stop till
you’re well out of sight, past the bottom
of the lane. I’ll leave my bike here,
duck back to it through the orchard as
soon as Wiggins moves, and catch you
up on the road again. Got that clear?
Right-oh! See you later.”
1 was prepared for some pretty start-
ling noises, but hardly for the pandemo-
nium that broke out up the lane. Two
voices—a high, querulous falsetto and a
deep, truculent bass, speaking in some
outlandish heathen language—took it in
turns to make the night hideous. One
felt that such an altercation must inevi-
tably end with blood —and lots of it —
being spilled. Then I heard the falsetto
voice giving me the signal that the coast
was clear, and the cow and I moved off
at the double.
“That was a mixture of Hindustani
and Portuguese,” Georgy told me when he
caught me up again, “and, if P.C. Wiggins
only knew it, probably the most indecent
language he ever listened to in the whole
of his career. However, we’re all right
now. No more coppers till we’re into
Old Bay—and there are side streets
there.”
He went on ahead of the cow again,
and I dropped behind. It was just as
well there were side streets in Old Bay,
for three times we had to leave the main
road and take refuge in them.
We were fairly into the suburb when
I found Georgy waiting for me at the
corner of a certain select and expensive
avenue.
“Third house up on the right; and his
gate’s open,” he said.
“Whose gate?”
“Man by the name of Black—a police
magistrate. He does the Wattle Bay
district first and third Tuesday every
month. And, Green’s River being in the
Wattle Bay district, Black is the man my
neighbor Smith will appear before to
answer charges beginning with allowing
a cow to stray on the King’s highway
and ending with allowing said cow to
do wanton damage to a police magis-
trate’s garden.”
Neither of us could have sworn after-
wards actually to having seen a cow go
in through the open garden gate of the
third house up on the right. Certainly,
one moment she was with us and the next
she had gone. But that had nothing to do
with us; and as we were really out for
exercise, anyway, we pedalled up to the
top of the avenue and then pedalled back
again. Just before we came to the main
road again, on our way back, I happened
to glance to the left.
“Someone’s left his gate open,” I ob-
served, very softly, to Georgy.
“So he has. I’d better go and shut it
for him. Some straying animal might
get into his garden —or out of it.”
He jumped off his bike and went back
and shut the gate very carefully and
noiselessly.
“That’s where Black, the police magis-
trate, lives,” he told me as we swung
round the corner. “Very keen gardener,
he is. Used to have some fine peonies
just inside the gate —but they don’t seem
to be there now.”
Then we headed for Green’s River and
home.
Early next morning Herb rapped on
the back door. “Mr. Henry up yet?” he
asked me, but not very hopefully.
“No,” I said. “And he doesn’t want
to be disturbed, either. He didn’t get
much sleep last night. Is it anything
urgent?”
“Yes,” said Herb. “One of our cows
is missing. I’ve looked all over the place,
but I can’t see her anywhere.”
“When did you last see her, Herb?”
“Last night when I was coming back
from the pub—about half-past eight. I
found her out on the road. Dunno how
she got there. Anyway, I put her into
the top paddock for the night. She isn’t
there now,” he added peevishly. And
then still more peevishly, “Damifino
where she is.”
He might have saved his breath. I
knew all too well where she was.
Berserk.
BY FREEMAN SANDOM.
SIX-FOOT-ONE in his stockings,
fifteen stone, a mighty mountain of
muscle, Olaf Jorgensen was the best
hammerman on the job, and probably the
worst singer in spite of daily practice.
He was taking a spell, leaning on the
heavy, long-handled sledge-hammer and
singing softly as he gazed out towards,
the Great Barrier Reef.
“Wot’s eatin’ you now, Dutchie? Get
on with the job, can’t you! ”
Mick Bent had exchanged the blunt
drill for a sharp one, and looked up irrit-
ably. He was a dried-up, sharp-featured
little man with a high-pitched, querulous
voice resembling the yap and snarl of
a fox-terrier.
Olaf’s eyes returned to the business in
hand. He smiled broadly, spat on his
ham-like hands, and again the hammer
blows and the bellowed song rang in
rhythmic beats over the hot granite head-
land round which the road was being
made.
“Say, ain’t you afraid he’ll crack that
nut of yours with his hammer one of
these days, you aggravatin’ him like
that?” Terrible Ted had asked one crib-
time.
“ ’lm? ’E's only a big, fat blob with
no more go than a jellyfish,” said Mick
contemptuously.
Larry Hammond, the jackhammer-
man, was the practical joker of the gang.
* f wouldn’t bank on that, Mick,” he said.
‘Don’t you know he’s a berserk?”
“Berserk? What the hell’s a berserk?”
“What! You don’t know what a ber-
serk is? All right, I’ll tell you. You’ve
heard of them old-time Vikings. Well,
when one of those blokes got into a
fight he flew off the handle properly ;
he would rip all the tinware off his back
and set to work in his bare shirt, tearing
about like a lunatic, slashing about with
his- sword and biting and gouging some-
thing terrible.”
“ B upkum,” snorted Mick. “Old
Dutchie wouldn’t hurt anyone.”
... m ind your steps. He don’t look
!. ® ue would hurt nobody, but he’s
liable to go off any time just the same. I
was speaking to his brother-in-law in town
tne other day. He said you couldn’t rightly
tell when the attack was coming, barring
that when he was properly mad he would
stop his everlasting singing first of all,
then he would sigh and say ‘Och-yah’ a
couple of times, and then he would tear
off his clothes and start fighting in his
bare shirt. That’s what berserk means,
see —a bloke what fights in his bare
shirt.”
Ted chipped in. “Well, Olaf only
works in a singlet, so I s’pose he’d tear
that off and go berserk in his bare skin.”
“Oh, shurrup ; you’re a coupler big
jays, the two of yous,” shouted Mick,
and flung away in a temper.
Nevertheless, during the long hours he
squatted, turning the drill monotonously
between the weighty blows, his thoughts
frequently returned to the conversation.
What would happen, he speculated, if
the big hammer should land a foot from
the drillhead —on the nut? What would
be left of Mick Bent then?
He resolved that it might be wiser to
avoid displeasing Olaf.
But good resolutions, though easily
made, are hard to keep. Mick suffered
from gastric trouble, and on bad days
irritability swept over him in compelling
waves and left him yapping and snarling
on the least provocation. With another
mate a royal row would have resulted,
but Olaf looked down indulgently on the
noisy mite at his feet, scanned the hori-
zon, stroked his moustache, sang and
worked.
Old Mother Salter had many short-
comings, but her cooking was excellent.
There are three items making for the
success of a boarding-house in a con-
struction camp. In order of importance
they are quantity, quality and speedy
service. The old woman looked after the
first two, but the last was young Maggie
Salter’s particular job, and it was done
to everybody’s satisfaction.
Many were the offers made her by
diners anxious to secure her services ex-
clusively for themselves, but she had
refused them all in no uncertain terms,
and until Olaf Jorgensen arrived on the
scene it was generally considered that the
boarding-house ran no risk of losing its

SELF-POISONING P
•. • a ... . 5
' Over 40 Ailments
are caused by clOQCJ^ci
intestines"
explains Dr. J. BRUENAUR
noted European Specialist
Constipation, indigestion, stomach
troubles, gastritis rheumatism,
neuritis, sciatica bladder weak-
ness, catarrh, frequent colds, head-
aches—lassitude and poor appetite
—all these and more can be caused
by the clogging of the intestines
which gives rise to Self-poisoning
(Autoxima).
NEARLY EVERYONE SUFFERS
Self-poisoning is caused through
incomplete evacuation of the
bowels. Nearly everyone suffers,
even people of regular habits.
Modern foods and lack of exercise
give rise to a flabbiness of the ab-
dominal organs which makes com-
plete elimination almost impos-
sible. Fragments of food waste
cling to the intestinal walls and
there decay, breeding germs and
poisons which enter the blood-
stream. Self-poisoning is all the
more to be dreaded because it is
hidden and often unsuspected. The
symptoms of self-poisoning are
always apparent, however. Skin
blemishes, those frequent head-
aches, fits of ‘blues,’ the strange
lassitude and weakness which pre-
vent you from entering fully into
the enjoyment of life all point to
you being a victim.
COLOSEPTIC BRINGS BACK
HEALTH
Before you can regain the spark-
ling health that is your birthright,
you must sweep away the poison-
ous intestinal accumulations. Drink
Poisons from sluggish intestines
spread throughout the body and
undermine health, physicians
explain. Coloseptic combats ill-
health by activating the entire
intestinal tract.

EQUAL TO 15 YEARS OF LIFE
I have been using COLOSEPTIC for over
three years. I have felt very grateful to it
as it effected a wonderful difference in
health and strength, equal to a recovery of
15 years of life. I became absolutely free
of any physical complaint whatever. I am
83 years of age and my health continues
perfect and free from any trouble. I now
find it only expedient to take COLOSEP-
TIC occasionally of a morning.
H. A. C., Auckland E.l
COLOSEPTIC in hot water every
morning. Coloseptic first loosens
the fermenting matter encrusted on
the walls of the intestines and then
gently sweeps it right out of the
body. Coloseptic activates the kid-
Ď
neys, the pores of the shin, the
respiratory apparatus, thereby rid-
ding the blood-stream of all im-
purities.
DRINK COLOSEPTIC EVERY
MORNING
COLOSEPTIC gives you the in-
ternal cleanness which is the first
step to perfect health. And with
the body internally clean how well
you feel. Gone are the aches and
pains, the feeling of being old be-
fore your time. You regain the
vim and vigour of youth, your step
is firm, eyes sparkle, you are a new
being alive to all the pleasures that
life can offer.

Name-
Address-
most valuable asset. But lately wise
tongues had been wagging. Into Maggie’s
studied sweetness when serving the big
man, and the extraordinary way his
plates were heaped up, much significance
was read. As for Olaf, his heightened
color and diffident “T’ank you, miss,”
could mean only one thing. As soon as
Olaf had plucked up enough courage
to ask her out for a walk, the business
would be settled.
Unfortunately the big man could not
screw up enough courage to make a
bid. He had let many golden opportuni-
ties go by, and was now longing for
some strong excitement that would carry
him out of himself and sweep him into
bliss.
Olaf was shovelling the last of his
plumduff into the appointed place when
he became aware of a disturbance at the
table behind him.
“Damn you!” someone was shouting,
“why ain’t you more careful?”
Swinging round, he saw Mick Bent
standing up brushing angrily at his
trouser leg, where a wet patch steamed,
while an overturned cup on the table
showed the source of the inundation.
Maggie stood close by.
“Sorry, Mr. Bent,” she was saying,
“but you knocked my hand with your
elbow.”
Olaf saw red. Before Mick had time
to move he felt himself gripped by the
shoulders, lifted high till his head bumped
against the tent roof and then planked
down on the floor with a force that
rattled every bone in his body. Terror-
struck, he looked up and into a pair of
blazing blue eyes. He slumped together
and shivered. This was the end. Olaf
was a berserk, after all!
But quickly as it had come Olaf’s rage
left him. He dropped the limp form and
walked back to his seat feeling a little
ashamed of himself. He finished his
plumduff hurriedly and prepared to
leave. Suddenly Maggie appeared with
outstretched hand.
“Thanks, Ollie, for sticking up for
me,” she said, and her smile made his
brain spin round and round dizzily. “It
wasn’t necessary, really, but it was sweet
of you just the same.”
“Ollie!” Olaf’s face was brick-red
from exposure, but the rich crimson
wave that rose from under his Jacky-
Howe put the work of the sun to shame,
He held her hand for a moment in his
huge paw, babbled incoherently, then
grabbed his hat and fled,
He had wanted excitement to say his
say, but this was by way of an earth-
quake.
Olaf could not have told how he
arrived back on the job. He found
himself standing with a firm grip on the
big hammer and a subdued and fearful
Mick Bent squatting before him, the drill
ready in hands that trembled a little. It
came to Olaf that perhaps he had handled
the little man a trifle roughly, and he held
out his hand.
“Pud it thare, Mick,” he said kindly.
“I’m sorry to have hurted you, but don’t
swear at Maggie again.”
“I’ll get even with the big stiff some-
time,” thought Mick as they shook
hands.
For the next hour Olaf’s mind was in
the company of Maggie Salter, while his
body stood in front of the hole to be
bored, and delivered .smashing and nicely
timed blows.
He thrilled again and again as he re-
constructed the scene.
She had called him “Ollie”! He dwelt
on the sweet smile, the warm handshake
and the kind words, and yet the hammer
never ceased to rise and fall in rhythmic
beats without swerving an inch from the
mark. Had it done so Mick Bent’s hands
would have been smashed to pulp.
Mick Bent’s thoughts were also stray-
ing. He was seized with an uncanny
feeling that something was wrong.
There was a strange silence over their
place of work that affected him like the
oppressive calm before a storm. Grop-
ing about for the explanation, it sud-
denly burst on him that Olaf was not
singing. Glancing up he noted a glassy
expression in the blue eyes, and Larry
Hammond’s remark occurred to him,
“The attack comes when he stops sing-
ing.”
Apprehensively he watched, and, as the
minutes slipped by without the expected
burst of song, fear came over him like
an ice-cold shower. He watched the
giant as a mouse watches a cat.
But, far from harboring homicidal
thoughts, Olaf’s state of mind was that
of an opium smoker under the sweet
influence of the drug.
She had called him “Ollie,” smiled and
shaken hands, and, based on these facts,
he was building castles in Spain at a
great rate. He had saved a little money
and built a house on his own ground.
There were chickens, a cow or two, roses
and cabbages. When he came home from
work of an evening Maggie stood at the
gate. “Hello, Ollie,” she said and smiled
and shook hands.
At that a sweet tremor passed through
Olaf and he rested on the hammer.
“Och-yah,” he said dreamily.
Mick Bent jumped as if the drill had
scorched him. This was the second
symptom of oncoming madness. He
looked fearfully around for a way of
escape. Working, as they were, at the
extreme end of the road, on one side
and ahead were sheer rock walls, the
other side slipped steeply into the Pacific,
a drop of twenty feet into deep water.
The only way out was back —past Ciaf.
Mick shivered, watching every move
of the big man.
Olaf had resumed business with the
hammer, and his dreams had taken a
more practical turn. Married life would
bring responsibilities. “Kids,” he thought
ecstatically. Three to begin with,
two boys and a girl. It would mean
hard work to keep the home together
and bring them up as was right
and proper. But he could work! It
was play to him! He spat on his hands
and put all his great strength into the
blows. He would show them! When
the engineer saw what he could do he
might make him a ganger. That would
be a quid a week more! His thoughts
bolted along the track of his career like
thoroughbreds. Faster and faster fell
the hammer.
Mick clung to the hot drill frantically.
Should he risk a dash for it?
Then it was that Larry Hammond took
a hand. Working the air-driven jack-
hammer is a monotonous job, and Larry
felt the need for diversion. He noticed
that Olaf was going at it hammer and
tongs, so to speak, and it struck him
that now was a chance to help along the
good work. He decided to try an experi-
ment.
“Look out!” he yelled.
Larry had healthy lungs, and was only
ten yards away, but in the din of clack-
ing tools only the ghost of his voice
reached Mick Bent. Still, it was enough.
With a yell of despair he dropped the
drill and jumped.
Panic-stricken men do foolish things.
Mick had planned his escape, but when
the time for action came he forgot every-
thing but the immediate need for getting
out of the reach of that terrible hammer.
He ran in the wrong direction, and in
a moment discovered he was between
the sheer cliff walls, the sea and the ber-
serk.
Mick’s yell brought Olaf back from
his Spanish castles with a jerk. He swung
round and watched his little offsider in
astonishment. Somehow he had always
had a suspicion that the irritable little
man wasn’t all there. This behavior
seemed to confirm his suspicions. Mick
was backing away, his eyes wide and
staring, his hair on end and one arm
raised as if to ward off a blow.
A loose stone was dislodged by Mick’s
foot and disappeared over the precipice.
“Look out, man!” cried Olaf, and
started forward. With a sobbing breath
Mick turned and jumped.
As stated, it was a sheer drop of twenty
feet, but fortunately the water was deep.
There was also a strong current running
in a northerly direction, and the place
was infested with sharks and crocodiles.
Olaf watched the supposed madman rise
to the surface and feebly strike out
southwards —against the current! With-
out hesitation Olaf kicked off his shoes,
swept the hat from his head with a back-
ward movement and dived.
Six months later the chief engineer in
a neat little speech presented ganger Olaf
Jorgensen with the Royal Humane
Society’s medal for saving a mate’s life
at the risk of his own.
Mrs. Maggie Jorgensen was present,
and very proud of her husband she \*&s,
but Mick Bent had put many miles be-
tween himself and the job. For Larry
Hammond had told the joke, and being
dubbed “Mick the Berserk” and having
playful navvies popping round corners
and shouting “Look out!” got on his
nerves.
The Sailors’ Lass.
Sydney is a sailors’ lass,
I can tell you why:
By the swaying of her hips
And her roving eye.
You may deck her out in flowers,
Drape her robes with green,
Womanlike she loves the waves
With the wash between.
Shining peak and sheltered slope,
Lordly walls and towers,
In her heart she craves the docks,
Drifting down the hours.
Tickle her with luxury,
Tempt her ears with song,
Still the Harbor sounds its note
Subtle, sure and strong.
Bronzed and bold her lovers come,
North and east and west;
Each and all she gathers in
To her ample breast.
Sydney is a sailors’ lass,
I can tell you why:
Years ago she pledged herself
To the sea and sky. •
QUEENSLAND.
